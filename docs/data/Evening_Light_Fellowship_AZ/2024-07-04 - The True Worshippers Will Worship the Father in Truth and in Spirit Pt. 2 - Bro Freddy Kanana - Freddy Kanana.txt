here oh God I can fill the presence of the Holy Spirit and how it looks like it's the not it looks like but it's the work of the Holy Spirit how you can even tell the songs and lining up with the ministering of the word that is about to come out you can tell this is the holy spirit working oh Father nobody made it to happen but you did it oh God may you bless us this evening oh father bless us oh God and give us what whatever it takes for us to keep pressing on in this battle the battle is on rampage or father the enemy doesn't back off he keep pressing on but we need to keep pressing on too father we need you oh god oh Jesus you said in your word where two or three are gathering in my name there I am in the very midst of them I'm so glad that we don't depend on the numbers but we depend on your presence oh Father tonight may you take full charge and full control over the service bless us as we go through the service in Jesus name we pray amen amen thank you musicians for your help in singing shall we remain standing as we go directly to the word shall we go straight to the uh Book of John chapter 4 verse 21- 24 Jesus sayith unto her woman believe be the hour cometh when you shall when ye shall neither in the in this mountain nor yet a Jerusalem worship the father you worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth shall we go to Matthew 4:9 to: 10 in sayith in sayith unto him this is the devil talking to our Lord Jesus Christ in sayith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get the hands Satan for it is written thou shallal Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word as we have your seats tonight thank you bon for trusting in my little Ministry uh to do something tonight but it's not going to be me it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen for we all depend on him even the songs that he been sang here you can feel that the presence of the holy spirit is here the songs we invited him to come and uh we sang how he's holy uh Angel singing Holy uh even uh us as Believers singing Holy but really brother bam says God he doesn't enjoy fully the worshiping of the Angels because angels they don't know what they are singing about but we do know what we're singing about because we've been saved by grace we can tell where we came from uh where we going and where we are at we can truly thank him and we can enjoy singing and praising him amen I know sometimes I don't know if it have happened to you when you see somebody coming to you and thanking you for something that you didn't even help him but he just come maybe he was confused just thanking you so you're not going to take that thank you know really you say no it's not me somebody else did it for you but if you really help the person and the person comes to you say thank you you really take it and you'll be appreciative you see so God takes more uh joy out of the Praises coming from the mouth of his children because they know that he is the savior even in the Old Testament Jesus I mean God was telling the children of Israel reminding them I'm your Lord I'm your God that took you out of the land of uh Egypt to remind them where they were and where they were and when he took them when when where he was with them you see so tonight my uh small uh cermonies the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth this is part two and for subject we take spiritual revealed truth so if you can tell the ministers can take one uh sermon and stay on the same sermon for a long time because you can approach the same subject from different uh standing Point thousands of thousands of times you can go you know this sermon part two part three four part thousand you can go on and on and on as long as God gives you Revelations to bless his children you can go on and on and on that's why tonight we're here to again with some of the uh the the the things he has opened to us because we've been pondering and meditating on these words so I believe it's going to be truly a blessing tonight amen so we talking about true worshipers in spiritual revealed truth worshiping truly didn't start here on Earth but it started in heaven but abam says God to to be God because he has more attributes in him as this big beings he had more attributes among which was the attribute of God but for that attribute to be fulfilled he had to be worshiped therefore he created angels and Angels start worshiping him and that attribute was fulfilled but Satan butam says he was a certain point as a coal with God he was among angels He is a create I mean a creation and God is a Creator a certain point he thought that he could be worshiped as God that's in heaven and says iniquity means something you know you should do but you don't do it and Lucifer as an angel he's supposed to be worshiping God but he want to be worshiped instead and the Bible says he was good until iniquity was found in him what was iniquity because he knew what he's supposed to be doing but didn't want to do it and was trying to be worshiped Tred to be above Angels Above other Angels that's what caused him to be precipitated from Heaven to he own the Earth not only in the earth they sent him in hell so this is if you look at the this subject you can see many things it's the worshiping that has caused all these troubles not only worshiping but wrong worshiping because God doesn't share his glory of nobody you go in the 10th commandment Moses when he gave the Ten Commandments he started with the your the Lord God is the only God you have to worship one time the Pharisees came over to Jesus they were talking to him asking him questions they came up to him tempting him that was a a lawyer who asked him that question what is the biggest um commandment among the the the law and he says the first one is you have to love your lord God with all your heart all your strength whatever you have in within you to love him and the second you have to love your neighbors and he says do these two first Commandments covering are covering all and then the the prophets and the law are hanging on to these two laws as I said this is a big subject because all troubles that we are going through it's because of the wrong worshiping coming here on the earth when Adam and Eve they got out of the uh they been cast or sent out of the Garden of Eden they had children like brother bam says can and abble and God approached him with the same way of approach to see how they're going to worship one worshiped right and one didn't the other one didn't as would be I'm trying to go ahead of myself but let's just go this way Abel came worship getting Revelation from God andam says in the message glorify Jesus he says now the only way that boy could ever ever did that and know that that was the right sacrifice it has to be a spiritual re Revelation from God that's exactly there has been he he meant to say been has been ever but they says he every it has been ever since spiritual revealed the truth how God in his Mercy through the operations of the Holy Spirit reveals spiritual truth the word itself if you're trying to read it from some educational standpoint you'll just read it like you were you was trying to figure out ma mathematically something but if you read it after you have received Christ into your heart it's a brand new book again it's just a love story God writing it to you it's spiritual revealed God's church is absolutely a spiritual re revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and no man can receive it by his own desire Jesus said no man can come to me ex except my father draws him first is that right yes it has to be a work of the holy spirit in in the beginning to draw the person and when the person comes to God by the Holy Spirit draw Jesus said I will in no wise cast him out give him everlasting life raise him up in the last day what a beautiful hope that gives the the church so last time we saw how um people can just worship and the true worshippers cuz many people here on the Earth are worshiping they are worshiping and Jesus when you see the way he approached this this woman two questions he was telling her woman you worship which that you don't know but we do worship which that we know for salvation is of the Jews if you go deep into this conversation in other words when he says the Salvation is of the Jews which means the true and living God is the god of the Jews it has proven many many times that the only God the creator of Heaven and Earth is the god that the Jewish worship you can go back in Old Testament in the time of uh Elijah the tishbite at one point the children of Israel they were like confused between baale and and God he was like H how long are you guys going to be between uh uh two gods baale and the Lord God today I'm going to prove to you that the Lord God is the true and living God Amen he took them at the Mount of carel and you know about the story remember we're talking about fellowshipping I mean worship shiing in truth and in spirit brother bam says in this message as we before I come back to what I want to say he says in uh God's provided place of worship he said Jesus said in St John 4 the time is coming and now is when God being a spirit will be worshiped in spirit and in truth now some people have Spirit no truth others has truth and no Spirit you can go back in the time of Jesus when he was here on the earth with the disciples the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus was the word the disciples they had the word but he didn't receive this holy spirit yet they need to have both to be the true worshippers they had the word with them but the word was not in them they heard about the true word of God because we worship God in spirit and the truth the truth means the word of God because Jesus said father sanctify them by Your Word cuz the word is truth am so since the head only the word as the prophet says here some have the word they don't have the spirit some have the spirit they don't have the word so he told them before he left the Earth go ye Terry in Jerusalem and until you'll be filled with the power from on high we're talking about the spirit amen and when the spirit when he came down fully and Jesus which mean because he said lo I will leave you and I'll come back to you again right was the same Jesus he was in the body of Flesh he was still the word but for him to come and dwell in them he had to go to the form he was before spiritual form for him to come down and dwell in the disciples which he did and you can see Peter and all the disciples they act before the Holy Spirit and after receiving the holy spirit before receiving the Holy Spirit Peter could chop off the head the ear of the the Roman soldiers Jesus told them this is not the Battle of Flesh and Blood this is spiritual battle Peter could not understand that before receiving the Holy Spirit but after he received the Holy Spirit see him acting he was the true worshipper you go back to Paul Paul before he went to the word he received the spirit first he met the spirit on his way going to Damascus persecuting the Believers butam say about 11:00 in the morning the pill of fire appeared to him soul soul why are you persecuting me who are you Lord but bam says as a as a Jew he's supposed to know that the pill of fire is the Lord and then he asked him why are you persecuting me you see so when when Paul received the Holy SP when he met Jesus right there the Bible says he went back to 7 went there start searching the scriptures he met the spirit first he didn't have the word he had to come and search the scriptures all right after he got both of them the spirit and the word he came out with one conclusion he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen you see when you have both then you can be the true worshipper cuz if we don't have both then I don't know cuz it's supposed to be coming in to worship God the provided Way by himself so all of this it has to be a spiritual revealed truth but bam says this let's read the Bible first before we go to the prophet anyways he said the the true angel will always Point people to the word the true Angel amen do you believe William BR was a true Angel there's no body that has preached the deity of Jesus Christ like William brandham did he didn't attract people to himself and when you see William Bram making a statement go read it in the Bible you'll see it in the Bible somewhere he said the words always come to the prophet it's unto the prophet to introduce the word to the people Jesus says the word came to John the Baptist in the water and John the Baptist was the one that introduced the word to the people in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 to8 when Jesus came into the coast of cyria Phil Philippi he asked his dis IES saying whom who do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets they say he said unto them but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven amen and I say also unto thee that thou art peaked Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gate of hell shall not Prevail against it you see it has to be individual Revelation when he he asked the question to the disciples not all of them they stood up say okay is this this and this and that no one stood up it's individual Revelation and then he said upon this Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and baram says since that time the time of Abel and Cain it always has it has always been the truth revealed by the spirit and the Church of God now is based on the Revelation coming by the spirit not all the Revelation but because bam says the greatest of all the revelations is the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is he says this in in the message the Patmos Vision paragraph 132 the greatest of all Revelations is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you you can't be to first base until you believe that work out that's what Peter said repent and then see the deity be baptized in the name of the in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of the sins and then you will you you you ready to get to go in the spirit the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ amen I am Alpha and Omega I am from A to Z there is no more but me I was at the beginning I'll be at the end I'm he that was which is and shall come the mighty think of it that's what the trumpet said so to really become a true worshippers the first thing here as brother bam says you have to have the revelation of who is God because that was the question that Jesus even asked to the woman I mean that was the conversation between Jesus and the woman you are worshiping something that you don't know nothing about but we do know what we worship so as we're going through you will find out what we are worshiping even us this evening the first of the Revelation is to know who is God mainly who is Jesus Christ Christ when you know that then he will come into your heart and start building his own church if you go in the statute of of of a perfect man bam is talking about now we are going to talk about the Living Church of the Living God it's not these walls it's you individually the first of the thing is God has to come to you because he said if you love my word and my words abide in you and you love my father my father love you and then we can come and dwell in you amen one time ask a question how can uh the Believers go grow spiritually he said you have to read the word and pray you see and he says if you love my word and my words abides in you then I'll come to you with my father and we can make a dwelling place in your heart and when he comes in your heart he will start to do the job of a deacon as he did in the church in the temple cleaning your heart kicking out all the evil spirit the second thing is going to be Faith because without faith you can even please God the first thing is to know who is God to know Jesus Christ that's the greatest of all the Revelation when you know him he comes into your heart then he start building his church starting with faith that's why 1947 William brandham started with faith is is the substance that's the first message the first recorded message as far as I know faith is the substance and he start building faith in your heart but that Faith you cannot have it by just sitting down like that no the Bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God you need to read your word I mean the word of God you need to be in a prayerful modood all the time that's how you can build up the faith and on the top of the faith you have virtues you have knowledge patience on and on until to brotherly love and to C off you have to have the perfect love amen which is God himself because bam says to go there you have to have the perfect faith and that started somewhere with the revelation of Jesus Christ otherwise you'll be worshiping God in vain because he didn't look at the the sacrifice of Cain you see our God is a good god even went to Cain told him you're supposed to be acting like your brother he was patient with him no because he was not the elect he didn't know what to do he had the altar but abam say the altar is the church and he put his flowers there and Bam says God doesn't need need your lies to be on the altar he need you to be on the altar to be identified with your sacrifice if you look at how Abel sacrificed how he brought his sacrifice he the BAM says he chopped off the head the the head of the uh the animal of the lamb and he was and Cain killed him able and his sacrifice were were were identified he died on the same altar with his sacrifice and B says when we come to the altar you need to come down God need you not your lies God needs you to come down and say Here I Am amen take out of the evil out of me so now you see this subject is very very important I was reading the trying to search this word of worship and I took the dictionaries the Websters I looked at the definitions it's a good fit for the subject Webster says worship means the re the uh the reverent love in Allegiance accorded a deity Idol or or a secred object and he goes on to say it's a set of religious forms is ceremonies prayers by which this love is expressed when Jesus ask him about the Commandment he started with the first commandment was love your God with all your mind all your soul all your spirit everything that is within you love him you see for you to worship something you need to love it and he says it's a set of all the forms religious forms ceremonies and prayers which we did here we sang we we prayed as part of worshiping and baram says you can worship something instead of God that's what Webster says here too because even is I say it didn't start here started in heaven Lucifer is not the Creator is a part of creation and if God has to hate something is worshiping something else instead of worshiping him wrong worshiping that's why the message we have received William brandham didn't come here with a message to attract people to himself he came here to United the people with God to establish the relationship between us as human being as Believers with God and then that's is the only thing that is going to make us a the true worshippers because now we worship what we know we worship God not only any God but we worship the creator of Heaven and the Earth and his name is Jesus Christ the sisters even sang here they said your name is above all names it's a good fit for this sermon because we talking about the deity of Jesus Christ and how to approach him worshipping is not something that we have to do when we come to church we should be in that mood in our daily life we can go down even in our prayers before we pray we don't have just to come God you know I need this I need that no no no no that's not a good approach you have to worship Him First telling him who he is what he did in your life not in the book what he did a long time ago no what he did in your life one one day I was when I was in Canada I was just meditating on uh on the word of God and looking at my life and the troubl sometimes I went through a lot of troubles with my cars and things sometimes I was something I was questioning myself why am I going through this you fix this this happen you do this this and a voice told me the Bible you are reading that's people's lives you are inspired by the life of somebody in the Bible okay you read Abraham went through trouble time 25 years waiting for a son to be be born so if you put yourself in his shoes to wait for 25 years for the son I don't know if you're going to handle that but he did handle that and something told me if God picks on you if he chooses you to bear this burden you just have to accept it because it's going to be for the blessings of some somebody else so when you pray worship Him First I remember one of my friends in the Congo his dad is a is a minister he's a pastor they were telling me that when the they need something from the dad they not just come any time no the wait when he's he prayed he prayed all day because they know his his schedule after he prayed and coming out of the prayer room then they can come to him dad can you give us money for this and that he's not going to resist because he's coming fresh from the presence of the Lord you know so if a human being can do that how much more the creator of Heaven and the Earth so when you start praying worship Him First tell him who he is what he did in your life in the lives of others too as well and then start telling him what you want so if you seee this uh this subject it all come to one thing because we talk about spirit and truth even the new birth Jesus said you need to be born and despite spirit and truth if you go back you find out the spirit is God himself because the Bible says God is spirit and those that are worshiping him have to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen the Bible say say at the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God all is about God so the true and living God is the god of the Jews is the one that William Brandon presented to us he said to Peter Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you cuz flesh and blood can reveal you something you know that in Garden of Eden when when God preached to his church Adam and Eve he told them not to go by the way of sex for reproduction but when the enemy came he brought a different sound of a preaching telling them God lied that's exactly what we're experiencing in this entire time where people are attacking the message trying to find mistakes in the message but I wonder you know in life when you leave something to go to something else that something else has to be greater than the what you are living but if you follow closely those people that are attacking the message and leaving the message they go worse you see this man 38 years in the Bible he was crippled but when Jesus healed him the FES and the sides no no that guy is is an evil guy but he said you want to be his disciples too well I know is just he prayed for me and I'm healed amen this message that they claimed to be false when they were in the message they were living holy they kept the family together but when they leave this message they go worse when when when Satan talked to Adam and Eve they were Gods already but he came with a lie if you do such a thing you'll be like God and when they followed him in what he was saying they went worse follow I had a friend of mine he he's a husband to my my sister's uh my wife's sister in the Congo he's he used to be a deacon in uh in uh br's Church his his young brother is here in America he start listening to those teachings so when I was in Canada he was sending me some those videos and can you respond to me this is going on even the ministers are I say wait I I'll come to you I'm I'm out so when I came to him I was like brother this didn't start today is something that has been going on for since since you know humankind is here on the earth Satan did the same thing in the Garden of Eden right so when he sent me that video I saw the the brother he's he's used to be a pastor here in America his name is a team Hume something like that I saw him with the Bible and with another book that he got somewhere and that person was talking about wrong things about the message M was like now you see him he's reading getting inspiration from Flesh and Blood yes that's what it is because the person who wrote that the the book got inspiration from from who and in abandoning the message that's why we need to worship God in truth and in spirit my brothers and sisters I'm asking you and I'm praying for you if you haven't you haven't received this Revelation in your heart do whatever you can to be in a prayerful prayerful mode mood read the Bible until you receive the revelation of Jesus Christ otherwise down the road the enemy will present you a different Christ and you're not going to resist amen look in the Bible Paul until he left this Earth he was together of Jesus Christ and he said what what can separate me from the love of God the pressures we are going through the suffering we are going through is for because of the wrong worshiping not only because of the wrong worshiping now because of we are resistant to the devil because he want us to worship Him him because we don't worship him he's on our cases bring all kind of persecutions and some people didn't resist because they didn't have revelation of Jesus Christ cuz once you have his Revelation he comes into you and the Bible says that's inside teacher even going into the marriage you need to have make sure you have the Holy Spirit make sure make sure you know who is God make sure you have him in his in your heart because when problem arise you'll be able to handle them because if you don't have him in your heart and she doesn't have him in her heart it's going to be trouble sometime but if both of you are filled of the Holy Spirit you can handle any situation many troubles and problems going through because we don't have that revelation of Jesus Christ and that Revelation doesn't have to come from a a preacher it has to come from God himself to your heart butam says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is paragraph 484 he says his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of a great revelation of God look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with is with Baptist Baptist you see it has to be the Revelation coming from Jesus Christ himself to you personally when he met Paul it was Paul Paul had a lot of people around him but says you can sometimes you can see him and either cannot see him or you can see him all all together when when when b b was preaching about the seven Church ages he appeared start drawing people screaming you can all see him one person can see him and others not but in that case Paul saw him you see and he received that revelation of who Jesus Christ was he didn't know him in the flesh when he was here on the earth Paul never met him but he knew him by the Revelation from the spirit of God and you look at the Peter even though he know him he knew him in the flesh but it behooves the Revelation from the spirit to bring the true revelation of Jesus Christ to Peter even though he knew him in the flesh but he has to have a revelation of who he is spiritually speaking amen because we're talking about the spiritual revealed truth and for some reason if you have a revelation somewhere it has to be in accordance with the word of God that's what Paul did he received that Revelation and he came read the Bible try to make sure it matches of the word try to make sure it's in the UR t if it's not here then I don't know it's something else and sometimes some people that make a mistake of taking one one quotation in the Bible something mean in in uh isolating it you know and take a Doctrine out of that it doesn't have to be isolated you have to find it from Genesis to Revelation it's like a chain you have to see it here there here there that's why the prophet of God is saying here in um in the message the pmos vision part two the prophet of God says this I was in the spirit let me just start from there I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his Spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would have not have brought these Visions it had to be the spirit of God it has to be the spirit of God with us too or all our efforts are in vain Paul said I will pray in spirit I will sing in spirit I will live in spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word am you see confirmed by the word and made manifest by the result it Bears let's take those people criticizing the message whatever they claim to have to be as a revelation of wrong things about the message that's the Revelation it didn't come from the spirit of God it came from somewhere you know if it's not God it has to be the devil and brother bam says it has to be a revelation has to come from the Holy Spirit from the spirit of God itself and you have to be Vindicated by the word and look at the the result the life after that you can understand the source of inspiration you see people one time they were in the message living holy living good life and all of a sudden they receive another inspiration from somewhere see the result after that but whatam says this here you can understand you can tell exactly where that inspiration came from because he says if there's anything good it has to be revealed by the spirit of God Vindicated by the word and see the result of it as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it for it is the same spirit the Bible says men of men of old they wrote the Bible they wrote the Bible by inspiration of the holy spirit amen how in the world are you expecting to understand just like that the scriptures that was inspired by the Holy Spirit you without the Holy Spirit try to understand that he can't fly you have to have the same Spirit you have to be in the spirit of the composer otherwise you'll be going in all kind of directions I remember one time uh I think is about um what um not John one of the ministers in Canada his name kind of um I can't remember his name right right now but he was mentioning something uh about when he was in uh High School his music teacher gave them a song and to repeat on and so the day of singing he didn't practice well so he was there among the other students and the teacher was just observing them play I me sing start singing and he said he pretend to have blown his trumpet but he didn't really he was just doing this to lie the teacher you see but the teacher knew that he didn't play his part he was not in the spirit of the composer you see he was lying he pretend to have played but he didn't do his job so if you cannot fool a human being how much more God right all right right you have to have his Spirit you have to have him in your life yes that's the first and the greatest of the Revelation who is God that way you can be a true worshipper because if you go over the Pentecostal they will tell you they are worshiping God they even pray day and night you can go start talking to them about Jesus down the road you find out they have three Gods some of them they will tell you Jesus is not God at some point but you and I have received a message that has fully explained to us who Jesus Christ is we have all the tools to make us the true worshippers amen there's no excuses we have the prophet have laid out everything exact exactly like Moses in all aspects of Life Moses brought the the clarification whether it's a marriage and divorce or this and that same in this end time remember before Moses wrote the Bible the four the first five books of the Bible he had to meet the pillow fire okay when Paul before he wrote in the New Testament he had to meet with the pill of fire in this end time the prophet that have that we have received you and I the first of the things has to receive the pill of fire am he did not bring the interpretation of the Bible based on his own knowledge no he was in the contact with the spirit same as Moses same as Paul so you and I are not excused we need to find the Same Spirit how do we find it by reading his word praying cuz he says if my words abides in you okay then I reveal myself cuz he cannot reveal himself to you if you're not interested in that you don't read his word you don't come to church you don't pray how can he reveal to you yes you need to show the interest reading his word praying now he can tell you love him brother Paul loves me now I can reveal myself to him amen not only reveal myself to him I can make my Dwelling Place in his heart not only that I can do the job of a deacon kicking out all the evil spirit instead building my own church amen brothers and sisters if we have God Jesus Christ in our heart we're going to be the strong Living Church of God because the church is not these walls but it's him and him only in our heart amen by the way of the truth revealed by his Spirit outside of that I don't know we'll be wasting our time but I believe from the bottom of my heart that this message has all it takes for us to make it through and I believe that with these words of exhortation God will help us to even dig in his word by the help of of the holy spirit cuz brother bam says here God with his Mercy through the operation of the holy spirit will reveal the truth to his people there's a some point that I want to make here you see that's the mercy of God that he has shown to brother Joshua that he has shown to brother Ron to to give you a revelation you can't BST your chest he was given to you by Mercy God was patient with you when you didn't know about this Revelation amen you can be too much on someone else you you you can't force him no be patient with him too amen because you you receive that Revelation by Mercy by the grace of God through the operation of his holy spirit you need to be patient with one another so if you see someone boasting his chur disfellowshipping people and christianizing other people you can tell he didn't receive that by Mercy it's something that he didn't even receive as as Revelation it's something that he pretended to be Revelation because if it was given to him by Mercy if it was given to him by God he would have been patient with others you get it because if you receive that God is in you he start building his church revelation of Jesus Christ Faith virtue patience knowledge whatever you have that in your heart you be be applying the same application to others I believe that I'm standing in the presence of the True Believers and the true worshippers that are worshiping in truth and in spirit if that is not the case my prayers tonight is for you to go on your knees and read the Bible outside of that there's no any other Miracle you can make it's just love him cuz he said if you love me you read his word you Fellowship you pray that's how he can tell you are interested in him you have the love of God and he will reveal himself to you and make you a true and living Church of God because the true Living Church of God is Not these walls it's you and I cuz the time we are living in it's a critical time you see many Elders in the message leaving this Earth it's it's a big sign it's not something that we need to take her positively like would be negligent to that no there's a message that God want to to us we have few of them left among which we have our pastor for us to receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Jews because the God we are we are worshiping is the god of the Jews Like Jesus said they have to reject him for us to receive him it's going to be the other way around you see how people are rejecting the message slow we have to reject him for them to receive him and it's going to be the end of it I don't think things will get better it get worse and worse it's up to us to hang tight because these voices that are bringing us into the line they are leaving us it's going to be like another generation that didn't know Joseph will arise another generation that didn't know the message will arise yes we are exactly heading to that direction and you see how some some many some other you know men of God are making some statements on you can see on YouTube and You' be shocked with why how how did he say this and for me those statements are preparing people to go down in hell if you are not careful yeah because the the the feble spirit will tell okay this is Brother R saying this you see they'll take it because of the the the uh the reputation of the minister they're not going to look into the Bible they're not going to look into the word to find out is this true no no they'll follow that because of the the reputation of the man so statements like that we have them a lot in the message today also my prayers is for us to help our children to be in the same pathway as we are I remember my son Malachi one time they uh I believe it was his uh birthday the the man oh no we need to go to the water fountain somewhere like okay let's go we got there and then all of them they had sh I was like how come I told him did you get baptized he say yes I said when you get baptized you are responsible to leave the word of God fully you are a brother you can't put the short on regardless you don't have to live in the flesh live in spirit amen you see I told him you you you you were baptized you need to be you are a brother can't put children on because oh no I'm I'm no no you are a brother even though you are my son you are a brother in Christ musician if you can work make your way up here so I believe these words of exhalation have done something to your heart uh and pray for me as we are digging to into the word whatever God will give to us as a revelation we'll go through the Bible through the message be [Music] praying and bringing them to you to help you going through this journey may God bless you richly have a song Let's sing this is my desire to honor you [Music] this is my

religious life it's Creeds dogmas there's no Spirit to make it you see you can have all the word and no spirit and all spirit and no word thank God that the Bride of Jesus Christ is right in the middle of the road amen with a with a combination yes well Balan of word and spirit because remember both just as he said look both God and Satan want to be worshiped so the God of this evil age hath blinded the minds of those who have not the spirit of God and so they worship the god of sports they worship hey every Sunday every sporting event they get out there they paint their faces they wave their Flags they blow their horns and they get and they call us Fanatics huh they're worshiping but they're worshiping the god of sports the gods of Music the gods of Hollywood the gods of fashion

that is pleasing to him amen it's true amen when you think about all of them out there worshiping and they everything that they do everything is that they might worship their father what about you and
