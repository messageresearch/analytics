[24:20] into things before our brother Freddy
[24:22] comes but uh boy we have sure stirred
[24:26] something up since last Sunday
[24:28] amen and because there's different
[24:30] questions and you know what none of
[24:32] those questions came to me they came to
[24:34] other ones within the church and it's
[24:36] amazing people you know if you got
[24:38] questions there is an answer there is a
[24:40] gospel answer to that and brother Bram
[24:43] said the the most misunderstood person
[24:46] in the world is Jesus Christ go listen
[24:48] to the sermon God being
[24:50] misunderstood so sometimes the prophet
[24:52] of God will say something he said it'll
[24:54] cause some to go away some to Pond over
[24:57] yeah huh he said you know if you're
[24:59] looking for something to make uh brother
[25:02] Brenham a false prophet or to find some
[25:05] kind of problem in this message you're
[25:07] going to find it that's right oh you see
[25:10] uh this and that and see there's just
[25:12] another one there he made a mistake
[25:14] there he he couldn't be a prophet bunch
[25:17] of nonsense amen and so I want all of
[25:21] you just going to show you I'm just
[25:23] going to show you from the word of God
[25:24] and then I'm going to give you a couple
[25:26] little examples and I probably am going
[25:28] to have a questions and answers service
[25:32] where any one of you we'll put a
[25:35] microphone right up here and you can
[25:38] walk right up here and you can ask the
[25:41] question without me knowing the question
[25:45] without knowing what you're going to ask
[25:47] but you got anything you hey let's do it
[25:49] and then let's go to the scripture and
[25:52] let's go to the message of the hour
[25:54] because you prove everything by the
[25:57] scripture go back to the word amen amen
[26:00] somebody say Amen am
[26:03] amen so praise the Lord St John chapter
[26:07] 21 I just going to show you from the
[26:09] scripture St John chapter
[26:12] 21 of how things can so easily get uh
[26:16] noised abroad and different ones say he
[26:18] said this and he said that and here it
[26:20] is the
[26:23] disciples the disciples St John 21 are
[26:26] you there Say Amen amen amen St John
[26:30] 21:20 I asked the brother yeah good
[26:32] there then Peter turning about seeth the
[26:36] disciple whom Jesus loved who's he
[26:38] speaking about St John the Divine one
[26:41] whom Jesus loved right seeth a disciple
[26:45] whom Jesus loved following which also
[26:47] leaned on his breast at supper and said
[26:49] Lord which is he that betrayeth thee and
[26:53] Peter seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and
[26:56] what shall this this man do talking
[26:59] about John what shall this man do and
[27:02] Jesus saying to him if I will that he T
[27:06] till I come what is that to thee follow
[27:09] thou me amen then went the
[27:12] saying look at
[27:14] this could you imagine if they had uh
[27:18] email or text messaging or iMessage or
[27:22] something where they could tell
[27:23] everybody and it it went around
[27:25] everywhere and look at this the Bible
[27:27] says then went this saying abroad among
[27:29] the Brethren
[27:31] Believers that that di that disciple
[27:34] should not
[27:35] die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall
[27:41] not die
[27:43] but if I will that he T till I come what
[27:47] is that to thee do you
[27:50] see
[27:52] so um brother
[27:56] Bram when he the first time he ever said
[27:59] I'm getting to be an old man's
[28:04] 1954 he says it over 20 times type it in
[28:07] your computer you know how to do it
[28:08] quotation mark I'm getting to be an old
[28:10] man 20 times from 54 to 65 I'm getting
[28:15] to be an old man I have to write things
[28:17] down I need glasses now to let you all
[28:19] know the
[28:20] quotes So he was looking at 50 years of
[28:24] age you know wow I'm getting to be an
[28:27] old man I want all of you to know I
[28:29] never thought I would be older than the
[28:33] prophet at his age when he went away he
[28:37] was
[28:38] 56 I'm 70 I'll soon be 71 who would have
[28:42] ever thought I'd be older than
[28:45] him okay this is just me speaking so he
[28:48] says I'm getting to be an old man 20
[28:51] times okay the first time 1954 he's 48
[28:55] years old last time is on trying to do
[28:58] God a service and in
[29:01] 1965 April the 29th brother Brenham
[29:05] prophesies in a sermon called choosing a
[29:08] bride and there he prophesies against
[29:11] Los Angeles he made a prediction in 64
[29:14] that God would sink that place he said I
[29:16] predict that before the coming of the
[29:17] Lord I showed you so even before it was
[29:21] prophecy he tells us that he's knowing
[29:24] he's a prophet he begins to know that
[29:26] something's happening now so in April of
[29:30] 1965 brother brandham is walking with
[29:32] his son Billy Paul you all have heard
[29:35] the testimony I've heard it multitudes
[29:38] of times have you not how many of you
[29:39] ever heard it why seemed like brother
[29:42] Billy Paul every time there was a
[29:43] convention he'd say well he'd look at
[29:45] the brother I'm not getting to be an I'm
[29:47] not an old man yet right he just say
[29:50] that and everything and so it it it was
[29:53] said and even 15 years ago sister
[29:56] Rebecca Smith which is brother brenham's
[30:00] daughter asked me if Billy Paul passes
[30:03] away are you going to be offended no no
[30:06] I because it was a
[30:08] conversation he had with his son like a
[30:11] father with his son walking along where
[30:13] are you I'm in California where downtown
[30:15] where are you in front of make company
[30:18] you think if if now let me tell you this
[30:21] is where I I I'm going to screw the
[30:22] screw down a little bit tight and you
[30:24] might squeak a little
[30:26] bit say what he says on
[30:33] tape show me where brother Brenham said
[30:38] sharks will be
[30:39] swimming in Los Angeles before Billy's
[30:43] an old man show me anywhere on tap in
[30:48] fact if you have a computer at home or
[30:50] you have a cell phone which all of you
[30:52] do and I hope you have the uh what do
[30:55] they call it the table
[30:58] type in shark or
[31:01] sharks how many times do he mention
[31:05] it
[31:08] twice he talks once about uh Paul who's
[31:11] going to be have a shipwreck and maybe a
[31:13] whale is following along and sharks in
[31:16] the water or a shark in the water Etc
[31:19] and the next time he he says talking
[31:21] about a man who was a pool
[31:25] shark two times he mentioned sharks show
[31:28] me anywhere that he says sharks will be
[31:32] swimming in the basement of May
[31:35] Company to fulfill it now I want to ask
[31:37] you a question any of you that knew
[31:39] Billy Paul traveled with him and asked
[31:41] him and and talked to him I want to ask
[31:42] you a question from the time of April of
[31:46] 1965 up until brother Billy Paul passed
[31:51] away he never referred to what some are
[31:55] saying was a fulfillment of that
[31:57] prophecy he who was there with his
[32:01] daddy never said Hallelujah I wasn't an
[32:05] old man and guess what sharks were
[32:07] swimming in the basement there do you
[32:09] see what I'm saying he missed
[32:12] it are you kidding
[32:15] me Saints don't be fooled amen don't let
[32:20] man some man say well this and that and
[32:22] you go and I typed into the May Company
[32:25] where you can go to the history storying
[32:27] of the May Company read it
[32:30] yourself was there ever a
[32:33] flood was there ever shark swimming
[32:35] there CU I've heard the
[32:38] rumor go listen to the historian nope no
[32:42] flood no sharks is that good enough for
[32:46] you that's a historian surely it'd be
[32:48] written down
[32:52] amen
[32:55] so again
[33:01] brother Brenham says many times my
[33:03] opinion you ever heard him say that my
[33:07] opinion I want to ask you what's the
[33:08] difference between brother bram's
[33:10] opinion and thus sayith the
[33:15] Lord I want to ask you come on now
[33:17] you're a Bible student if he says thus
[33:20] sayth the Lord he said a it ain't me
[33:22] saying it against my own better judgment
[33:25] well I tell you when God says thus say
[33:27] Lord you write it down amen he said now
[33:30] this is to my opinion
[33:33] okay now how many of you know and you
[33:36] brother Brenham talks about the
[33:40] Negroes he says how many of you
[33:43] know that there was a word that went
[33:45] around this is in the sermon he cares do
[33:47] you care did you prophesy here's a
[33:51] question did you prophesy a million
[33:53] Negroes will get killed or did you just
[33:56] announce that there this would be a
[33:58] happening there's so much of it that's
[34:01] just the human side I'm quoting what he
[34:03] said Martin Luther
[34:06] King millions are going to lose their
[34:08] life thousands will come to their death
[34:11] how many of you have heard him say that
[34:14] so they asked the question did you
[34:15] prophesy this said no this is The Human
[34:19] Side I'm
[34:21] reading but always if there's something
[34:24] that goes forth it will speak thus
[34:26] sayith the
[34:27] Lord even divisions or anything no I was
[34:31] just talking about Martin Luther King on
[34:34] this great disaster that they're having
[34:36] in the South with the colored people and
[34:39] I think Martin Luther King is a
[34:40] communist he's communistic
[34:44] inspired which is going to lead a
[34:46] million people to an absolutely a death
[34:51] trap see I don't say the Lord told
[34:55] me say what I say on the
[35:01] tape did you prophesy it brother
[35:04] Brandon you colored people you people of
[35:08] color you should be
[35:09] interested because if he said thus say
[35:12] the Lord and everything then show me
[35:15] where it
[35:16] happened it didn't happen now watch
[35:18] listen to what he
[35:20] said I don't say the Lord told me that I
[35:23] believe I believe it shouldn't be done I
[35:26] think the people to be Christian
[35:27] recognize one another as
[35:29] brothers it's inspired of the wrong
[35:33] thing them people that's the reason I
[35:35] say that not that there's any prophecy
[35:38] concerning it I have nothing on it from
[35:41] the
[35:43] Lord so be sure now if I say anything
[35:47] from the Lord like that I'll tell you
[35:49] it'll always I'm speaking now when he
[35:52] speaks and it's not me it's thus sayith
[35:55] the Lord
[35:57] and I can't say it until he tells
[35:59] me I could be allog together wrong in my
[36:04] my thought that Martin Luther King I
[36:06] don't know I can't say it's just my
[36:13] opinion how many of you know brother

[37:56] present present certain things that's
[37:57] fine go ahead that's fine you have that
[37:59] right you want to preach Jehovah's
[38:01] Witness Doctrine go ahead he said if
[38:04] Oran nevils voted in random Tabernacle
[38:07] and he preaches Jehovah's Witness
[38:09] Doctrine he can do it but I'm held
[38:12] accountable before God and I take
[38:15] everything back because
[38:18] I'm I'm a stickler when it says to say
[38:22] what I say on the DAT
[38:25] amen I don't care if it's I believe I
[38:28] talk to him I spent many time every time
[38:31] I was in a convention and Billy was
[38:32] there he was mentioning that I believe
[38:35] he talked to him I believe he told him
[38:38] those things but saints of God let's
[38:41] let's well some people are going to
[38:43] leave the message well leave
[38:46] it you poor back boneless without a
[38:49] revelation type believer you were just
[38:51] looking for an escape patch that's all
[38:55] the prophet of God didn't make no mist
[38:56] mistake he's telling Billy Paul Hey
[38:58] listen I tell you what Billy where are
[38:59] you I'm in California downtown in front
[39:02] of a
[39:04] company I believe that before you know
[39:06] man sharks will be swimming in this area
[39:09] did he say inm company did he say in the
[39:12] basement no come
[39:15] on and then what we can do we can
[39:17] spiritualize
[39:18] it oh well Billy he's not an old man now
[39:22] he's a young
[39:25] man
[39:27] and then where do we stop that's right
[39:30] cuz you start doing this to your
[39:31] children your young
[39:33] children and eventually they're going to
[39:35] look up to you and say hey Daddy ain't
[39:37] nothing to this message man look at all
[39:40] the division all this and that and he
[39:41] this and that and we supposed to go on
[39:43] the Moon and Earth is flat and all kinds
[39:45] of rumors that are huh I mean no that's
[39:48] a that is a doctrinal teaching right now
[39:51] in the message world's
[39:55] flat
[39:58] so I told Brother Freddy brother Freddy
[40:00] I'm sorry I said I take a few moments
[40:04] here before because and it's good and
[40:07] there's a bunch of questions and I'm
[40:09] going to answer those questions as they
[40:11] were given to me and we're going to have
[40:14] a glorious time and we're going to say
[40:15] what he said we're going to look into
[40:17] the message and then I want all of you
[40:19] to research it
[40:21] yourself amen because don't take my word
[40:24] for it get into it
[40:28] yourself and you can Google you can you
[40:32] know research and go to what not what's
[40:36] up to uh the table look at it yourself
[40:41] and in fact that's what we'll do we
[40:43] probably have the brethen I'll say do
[40:44] you have the table on the computer yeah
[40:47] okay type in the word shark or
[40:52] sharks then let you read
[40:55] it now say what he said he didn't say
[40:59] sharks will be
[41:02] swimming listen saints of God God's
[41:05] going to bring his word to pass however
[41:07] way he wants
[41:08] to but it's amazing that this little
[41:12] thing is going out and people are having
[41:13] all kinds of questions and stuff like
[41:15] now CU Billy Paul has passed
[41:17] away okay and what's amazing is the very
[41:22] one who walked with him who was there
[41:26] when he spoke to him about it never
[41:30] once
[41:32] mentioned you know what there was an
[41:34] earthquake in Los
[41:36] Angeles the other day and guess what
[41:39] water went all the way to only one only
[41:41] one place it's amazing just went to make
[41:45] company went to the basement and brought
[41:47] with it sharks and sharks are
[41:55] swimming
[41:58] please Common
[42:01] Sense Common
[42:03] Sense okay now I believe God if he
[42:06] wanted
[42:07] to he could put sharks in the
[42:11] basement I believe he can do it God can
[42:14] fill his so I'm not saying God can do it
[42:18] okay but what's amazing is Billy Paul
[42:21] never refers to it so why in the world
[42:24] do we let people who even while Billy
[42:26] Paul was still alive why didn't Billy
[42:28] Paul and voice of God put it on their
[42:31] website prophecy
[42:33] fulfilled nonsense see what I'm saying
[42:36] I'm just appealing to your common
[42:39] sense and uh I trust that all of you do
[42:42] and all of you are just bold enough to
[42:45] say brother Ron I don't want your
[42:49] opinion I want to hear what brother
[42:52] Brenham said about
[42:54] it okay so we go back to the
[42:57] and we research it to we you exhaust it
[43:00] brother Ezra to the nth degree and find
[43:03] out did he say it now if he doesn't say
[43:06] it I believe he talked to Billy Paul
[43:08] about it of course but I'm not here to
[43:12] uh defend or to say well spiritually and
[43:15] this and that and all of that and then
[43:17] people making fun of me saying well yeah
[43:21] you're from LA and you know
[43:24] La yeah well I'm sorry I was born there
[43:28] I'm a city slicker from La born in
[43:31] Pasadena yeah but I promise you if the
[43:36] prophecy was to be in your city where
[43:39] you were
[43:40] born maybe
[43:42] kinasa
[43:44] lashi
[43:48] Nairobi and you know how big the city is
[43:51] millions of
[43:52] people and there's going to be water
[43:55] come
[43:56] come and fill one building and all of
[43:59] that and it's 14 miles from the sea
[44:02] either God did the greatest miracle and
[44:04] he just went ahead and put water down
[44:06] there and then he put sharks in it to
[44:09] fulfill it come
[44:12] on SO brother Billy Paul always referred
[44:15] to there's coming a
[44:17] time that La is going to get destroyed
[44:21] amen it's going to go be beneath the sea
[44:24] and sharks will be SW swimming in this
[44:26] area we know that so saints of God God
[44:29] bless you brother Freddy you forgive me
[44:32] my
[44:33] brother here I give a little bit of a
[44:36] gospel posterior
[44:42] protoplasm because I am

[50:13] world shall we go in Matthew 18 this is
[50:17] the last one and you can have your seat
[50:19] after that Matthew
[50:24] 18
[50:28] verse 10 to
[50:32] 11 take heed that ye despise not one of
[50:36] these little ones for I say unto you
[50:40] that in heaven the Angels do always
[50:43] behold the F uh the face of My Father
[50:47] which is in heaven for the son of man is
[50:50] come to save that which was lost may the
[50:54] Lord had the blessing to the reading of
[50:56] his word as you have your
[50:59] seat I believe it's going to be a double
[51:01] portion tonight amen because yeah as the
[51:06] ship heard standing behind the secret
[51:08] desk and try to bring the
[51:10] ship to guide him with the staff and the
[51:13] the the
[51:15] rod thank you Lord that's what we're
[51:17] going to talk
[51:19] about so my uh small subject I didn't
[51:21] want to go with uh the ministry of
[51:24] angels again we have too much to uh talk
[51:28] about but the spirit kind of led me um
[51:31] different way um maybe we can talk about
[51:34] this and it going to be an encouragement
[51:36] to all of us our journey started in in
[51:39] God's mind and for a small subject my
[51:43] sheep hear my
[51:48] voice you know for human beings we
[51:51] believe our journey started from our
[51:54] birth and until our
[51:57] death but as a Believer or Believers we
[52:02] don't think that way that's
[52:06] right our journey didn't start when we
[52:08] were
[52:09] born neither is going to end when we
[52:14] die we have received the message that um
[52:17] has come to position us as a
[52:21] Believer to tell us really where we came
[52:24] from amen where we're going and why we
[52:27] are here on this Earth yes
[52:29] sir my brothers and sisters I want you
[52:31] to know that the man who spoke in this
[52:35] end time is not only a human being that
[52:38] has spoken to us but God himself spoke
[52:41] to us
[52:47] amen with the message we came to find
[52:50] out that we didn't start from the day we
[52:53] were born but we start way up there in
[52:56] the mind of
[52:57] God butam
[53:00] says in the
[53:02] message who is this
[53:15] madc who MC preached in
[53:21] 1965 February the 21st
[53:24] evening
[53:25] we start with paragraph 24 I believe now
[53:29] in the beginning God dwelt Alone with
[53:32] his
[53:32] attributes as I spoke of this
[53:36] morning that's his
[53:39] thought there was nothing just God
[53:42] alone but he had
[53:46] thoughts just like a great
[53:48] architect can sit down in his mind and
[53:52] draw out that he thinks is going to
[53:57] build now he cannot
[54:00] create he he can take something that has
[54:03] been created and make it a different
[54:07] form out of it because God is the only
[54:11] one that can create but he gets in his
[54:15] mind what he's going to
[54:18] do and that's his
[54:21] thoughts that's his
[54:23] desire now it's a thought and then he
[54:27] speaks it and it's a word then a word is
[54:32] a thought when it's expressed it's a
[54:35] word a thought expressed is a word but
[54:38] it's it has to be a thought
[54:41] first so it's God's
[54:44] attributes then it becomes a thought and
[54:46] then a word notice those who have
[54:51] tonight eternal life was with him and in
[54:55] in him in his thinking before there
[54:58] there was ever an an angel star cheram
[55:02] or anything else that's Eternal and if
[55:06] you have eternal life you always was not
[55:10] your being here but the shape and form
[55:14] that the infinite
[55:18] God and if he isn't infinite he isn't
[55:23] God God has to be
[55:25] infinite we are
[55:27] finite he is infinite and he was om
[55:32] omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent
[55:38] omnipotent if he isn't then he can be
[55:42] God knows all things all places because
[55:45] of his
[55:48] omnipresence omniscient makes him
[55:52] omnipotent he is a being he's not like
[55:55] like the
[55:56] wind he's a being he dwells in a
[55:59] house but being omniscient knowing all
[56:03] things makes him
[56:05] omnipresent because he knows everything
[56:08] that is going
[56:10] on in other words him knowing
[56:14] everything before they happen makes him
[56:18] omnipresent for instance you might be
[56:20] home uh talking with a brother or sister
[56:24] you're home talking
[56:25] uh fellowshipping and then another
[56:27] brother will give you a call say okay
[56:29] something happened there can you go
[56:31] check such and such and things are you
[56:33] here cuz because he knew at this time
[56:36] something will happen and he'll tell you
[56:37] to go check it out you might think he
[56:39] was there because he knew that thing
[56:41] will happen it makes him
[56:44] omnipresent did you get it amen by God
[56:48] knowing everything in advance makes him
[56:51] omnipresent he's not like a wind like
[56:53] the Catholic Church tried to to present
[56:55] to us God they said he's everywhere no
[56:58] he's a
[57:00] being he knows
[57:03] everything just the simple fact that he
[57:05] knows everything in advance makes him
[57:10] omnipresent the prophet continues to say
[57:12] and he knowed it before there was a
[57:15] world how many times it's a
[57:18] b it's uh how many
[57:20] times it would
[57:23] B its eyes
[57:25] and how much tall it had in it before
[57:29] there ever was a
[57:31] world that is
[57:33] infinite we can't comprehend it in our
[57:36] mind but that's God but
[57:40] infinite and remember you your eyes your
[57:43] statur and whatever you was you were in
[57:47] his thinking at the beginning and the
[57:51] only thing that you are is the
[57:53] expression word after he thought it he
[57:59] spoke it and here you are if it
[58:03] isn't you wasn't in his
[58:06] thinking there is no way at all for you
[58:09] to ever be there for he is the one that
[58:14] gives eternal
[58:16] life but says we were in his thinking in
[58:21] his mind am and there from there he knew
[58:24] knew who was going to serve him who's
[58:27] going to believe him and who's not going
[58:29] to believe him we were put on the free
[58:32] moral agency in his mind because the
[58:35] Bible tells us as we read it in
[58:37] Revelation
[58:39] 138 the lamb was slain before the
[58:43] foundation of the world Amen where in
[58:45] the mind of God that's right God put us
[58:48] in the free moral agency in his mind and
[58:52] freely we were making a choice of which
[58:54] which way we're going to
[58:55] take and he knew each one of us who's
[58:58] going to take which way sir so those
[59:01] that have picked his way or the way of
[59:05] life he put the names in The Book of
[59:09] Life of the Lamb Hallelujah those that
[59:12] the lamb was going to come down to save
[59:17] them we're going to see it through the
[59:23] Bible
[59:26] in the message of faith of Abraham
[59:29] preaching
[59:31] 1955 the 18th of November butam says
[59:36] this and predestination is a hard word
[59:39] among a Congregation of people because
[59:42] predestination really for knowledge is a
[59:45] better word and predestination looks
[59:48] back to for knowledge and for knowledge
[59:50] looks unto
[59:53] destiny that that God being infinite in
[59:57] the beginning knew the end from the
[59:59] beginning therefore he knew what people
[1:00:02] would do so he could
[1:00:06] forell what would take place for he knew
[1:00:10] what would be therefore before Esau or
[1:00:15] Jacob either one was born God could say
[1:00:19] Esau have I hated and Jacob have I
[1:00:23] loved because he
[1:00:26] forew what they could be he never made
[1:00:31] Esau the way he was he wasn't willing
[1:00:35] that Esau would be that way but Esau by
[1:00:40] choice he wasn't willing that Esau would
[1:00:44] be that way but Esau by
[1:00:48] choice God knew he would take that
[1:00:51] way so that's how he knows us today he
[1:00:56] knows your
[1:00:58] heart and you might be able to fool your
[1:01:01] neighbor you might be able to fool your
[1:01:04] pastor but you'll never be able to fool
[1:01:07] God Amen cuz he knows your
[1:01:12] heart so that's us in his
[1:01:16] mind
[1:01:18] now in Genesis 1 20 uh verse
[1:01:23] 26 God said let us created a human after
[1:01:28] our likeness in our image and the Bible
[1:01:31] says he created a
[1:01:34] man he created a man spiritual man not
[1:01:37] physical he created a man he created a
[1:01:41] man a male a female created he them you
[1:01:46] see amen that's the marriage uh uh
[1:01:49] um secret
[1:01:53] here before we were
[1:01:56] one before we were born and before we
[1:01:58] came here on the earth we were one male
[1:02:01] and female God put us in
[1:02:04] separate God put us in separate in
[1:02:07] separate families and God re reunited
[1:02:10] us right but he put Adam and Eve he
[1:02:14] created them male and female Spirit he
[1:02:17] took them he put them in one body at a
[1:02:19] certain time he separate them and after
[1:02:21] that he reunited them again you get the
[1:02:24] point
[1:02:26] amen he created him one man with female
[1:02:30] and male Spirit together both of them he
[1:02:33] put them in one body and after that he
[1:02:36] separate them when he took the reib off
[1:02:38] of uh Adam and
[1:02:41] made uh Eve and after that he reunited
[1:02:45] them again that's marriage so you should
[1:02:48] be able to take your time go in deep
[1:02:51] prayer and God will operate the uh
[1:02:55] he the surgery to take your rib and make
[1:02:58] your your
[1:03:03] Eve so it's a revelation on its
[1:03:06] own so now
[1:03:08] God took that man he created spiritual
[1:03:12] man put him in a
[1:03:14] body in a human body because the Bible
[1:03:17] says after he created all the earth and
[1:03:21] the everything on it and heaven and
[1:03:23] everything
[1:03:25] so there's nobody to K the Earth he need
[1:03:29] a physical man not a spiritual man
[1:03:31] that's why he formed that's Genesis
[1:03:34] 2:7 Adam the body formed from the dust
[1:03:39] and he took the spiritual part he put it
[1:03:42] in the physical
[1:03:43] part the Bible says he breathed the
[1:03:46] breath of life and the human being
[1:03:48] became a living Soul amen and I want you
[1:03:51] to get something here for
[1:03:55] our Earthly Journey he breathed the
[1:03:57] breath of life and for our spiritual
[1:03:59] life he breathed too Jesus
[1:04:03] breathed receive that was brother says
[1:04:05] that was a
[1:04:07] promise
[1:04:09] amen so and then this man which is Adam
[1:04:13] he was put in the kingdom was the only
[1:04:16] one that could tell us how was the
[1:04:19] kingdom of God before when because he
[1:04:20] was there and the scene took him out of
[1:04:23] the presence of God
[1:04:25] and he was
[1:04:30] lost so in the Kingdom he was living by
[1:04:33] faith he was living by the word of God
[1:04:36] he didn't need to work he was just
[1:04:38] speaking a
[1:04:40] word
[1:04:42] until because he lived by the word of
[1:04:44] God God preached them said you don't
[1:04:46] have to touch of this
[1:04:48] tree you have to
[1:04:50] live this way that's God preaching to
[1:04:53] them and as long as they were sticking
[1:04:55] to that word they were alive and well as
[1:04:59] long they were behind that word they
[1:05:01] were protected amen until the enemy of
[1:05:04] the Lord came to preach a different
[1:05:08] Doctrine like in this end time because
[1:05:11] now it's not it's no more Amnesia this
[1:05:15] is an apostasy people are walking away
[1:05:18] from the
[1:05:19] message the message has come to remind
[1:05:22] us of where we came from where used to
[1:05:24] be but now this is apostasy people are
[1:05:28] leaving the message and I know this
[1:05:30] opportunity with the departure of uh
[1:05:32] brother Bill Paul many isms will arise
[1:05:35] again will cause many to leave the
[1:05:39] message so until the enemy when he came
[1:05:44] preached something else trying to tell
[1:05:47] Adam and Eve that whatever God told you
[1:05:50] was a lie exactly what people are doing
[1:05:53] today amen
[1:05:54] it's the same thing there's nothing new
[1:05:56] Under the Sun that's
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:01] so that's how a humankind was
[1:06:06] lost now God decided to rescue the
[1:06:11] humankind he didn't send an angel he
[1:06:14] didn't send a cherubim but he had to
[1:06:16] send the word remember when we talk with
[1:06:18] uh about the brother Evan when brother
[1:06:21] bam kind of explained how he car was
[1:06:24] stolen remember we spoke of it last
[1:06:28] time butam says when the brothers
[1:06:30] brought the issue to him cuz they say
[1:06:33] let's take it to brother bam which is a
[1:06:36] good thing let's take it to the men of
[1:06:37] God Amen and then brother B was the true
[1:06:40] man of God he didn't say okay I'm going
[1:06:42] to give you a solution no no no let's
[1:06:44] take it to the
[1:06:45] Lord by the way of
[1:06:47] prayer they prayed and brother bam says
[1:06:50] we s the
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:54] the
[1:06:55] spirit so that's how when you read the
[1:06:58] message you need to take your time and
[1:06:59] go deep and read and the Holy Spirit
[1:07:02] Will Reveal more stuff that's right this
[1:07:05] is exactly what God did he didn't send
[1:07:07] anything else he sent his word because
[1:07:10] the news came up to him that his
[1:07:12] children they walked
[1:07:15] away they didn't stay with the word and
[1:07:19] he has to say a
[1:07:22] word he sent a sheer
[1:07:25] H Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] himself
[1:07:31] because his children got
[1:07:34] lost and Bam says
[1:07:41] in in the
[1:07:43] message lamb and
[1:07:47] Dove now I've often wondered why God
[1:07:50] ever represented us as Lambs we are the
[1:07:54] Sheep of his
[1:07:57] pasture if you notice a lamb is one of
[1:08:00] the most unusual
[1:08:02] animals that lamb cannot find his way
[1:08:05] back when he's
[1:08:07] lost I've raised
[1:08:09] ship and let a sheep get lost he will
[1:08:13] stand there and blade till he dies he
[1:08:17] cannot find his way back he's got to
[1:08:20] have a Shepherd to lead him back and we
[1:08:24] will never find our way back through any
[1:08:28] other way but through the shepherd
[1:08:32] amen the human race
[1:08:35] lost it needs to be shephered
[1:08:39] back we cannot find our way back through
[1:08:42] education programs that's right we
[1:08:44] cannot find our way back through
[1:08:47] science we could not find our way back
[1:08:50] through
[1:08:51] religions there's only one way back
[1:08:56] Hallelujah and that's by
[1:08:58] Shephard and I remember the prophet of
[1:09:01] God remember that was William Bram that
[1:09:03] said somebody was lost in the wilderness
[1:09:05] and couldn't find his way back and he he
[1:09:08] saw somebody else passing by say hey hey
[1:09:11] how how do I get out of here he said how
[1:09:12] did you get there so I came in through
[1:09:14] that way that's the way
[1:09:15] [Laughter]
[1:09:20] out so you
[1:09:22] see we were
[1:09:25] lost Adam and Eve were trying to go back
[1:09:28] to the Tree of Life with the religion
[1:09:31] the aprons they made out of the Fig
[1:09:33] leaves and when the sun rose it dries
[1:09:37] all the figs leaves off and then they
[1:09:39] couldn't that was a religion manmade
[1:09:42] religion until when God came and took
[1:09:44] the skid of the the the lamb and covered
[1:09:49] them so they couldn't find a way back
[1:09:51] and God Blocked the way to the tree of
[1:09:53] of life he put some cherubims with the
[1:09:56] Flaming sword to protect them from
[1:09:59] coming there and it's amazing that God
[1:10:03] after the coming of Jesus Christ now he
[1:10:05] put angels with the two- AED sword to
[1:10:09] push the Sheep back to the Tree of Life
[1:10:13] Hallelujah yes
[1:10:15] sir so we couldn't do nothing and God
[1:10:20] killed the lamb to show that the true
[1:10:23] lamb will come meantime you need to be
[1:10:26] covered but the true lamb will come
[1:10:30] because the blood of buls and gold could
[1:10:33] not take away the sin it only covered
[1:10:36] the sin until the the great Shepherd
[1:10:40] came
[1:10:41] down and when he did come his main
[1:10:45] mission was to redeem us the Redemption
[1:10:49] supposed to take place on
[1:10:52] Calvary
[1:10:54] but he had to be born he had to do some
[1:10:58] Ministry preaching to us and showing to
[1:11:00] us what what we used to be taking them
[1:11:03] nesia away because when he was walking
[1:11:05] on the water I mean when the Peter and
[1:11:08] other disciples were on the ship and
[1:11:10] they saw him walking on the Water Peter
[1:11:12] said can I come to you he said sure you
[1:11:14] can
[1:11:15] come Peter
[1:11:17] walked all the preachings and all of
[1:11:20] that he was trying to show us we used to
[1:11:22] be
[1:11:24] we used to be in the Kingdom we used to
[1:11:27] to live by the word we used to just say
[1:11:30] a word something happened that's why he
[1:11:32] said just believe and say a word and
[1:11:35] it's going to take place all of that was
[1:11:38] trying to take the Min away he was
[1:11:39] trying to show us the way
[1:11:51] back and all of that he did it with his
[1:11:54] word like uh David
[1:11:57] said in um in Psalms
[1:12:01] 23rd verse 4 he said yeah though I walk
[1:12:05] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:12:08] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:12:13] with
[1:12:14] me thy rod and thy stuff they comfort
[1:12:20] me our shephards always Comfort us
[1:12:24] this gives us Assurance CU his staff
[1:12:27] which is his word and his Rod still his
[1:12:29] word they give us
[1:12:32] confidence and you see the staff the
[1:12:34] curly part of the staff he can rescue as
[1:12:36] a Shepherd can rescue the the sheepen
[1:12:39] when the fall somewhere that's why you
[1:12:42] see a brother coming to you with a word
[1:12:45] the staff of God try to bring
[1:12:47] encouragement to you that's God risking
[1:12:51] you thank you Lord with his St
[1:12:55] using the curly part of the staff to
[1:12:57] pull you out of the
[1:12:59] ditch and with his
[1:13:02] Rod he can beat and take away all the
[1:13:05] beats the wild beats that can come and
[1:13:07] eat you up because the Bible says like
[1:13:11] brother bam says God always defeat the
[1:13:14] Devil with the
[1:13:15] word anywhere all the time he uses his
[1:13:20] word to defeat the enemy and he uses his
[1:13:22] word to encourage you that's his staff
[1:13:26] in his
[1:13:27] Rod great
[1:13:35] Shepherd
[1:13:38] so after his
[1:13:41] uh work here on the earth he called the
[1:13:44] the disciples because he's a
[1:13:50] shepherd He start calling them
[1:13:53] he started with the the 12 the
[1:13:57] disciples when John the Baptist finished
[1:13:59] preaching and baptized the Jesus Christ
[1:14:02] and some other people one day he saw
[1:14:05] Jesus walking by he he told the the
[1:14:07] disciples Behold the Lamb of God that is
[1:14:09] taking away the sins of human follow
[1:14:14] him some of them he called them some of
[1:14:19] them the prophet pointed them to
[1:14:22] him same thing as
[1:14:26] us like Elijah waved the
[1:14:29] mentle at
[1:14:31] Elisha and you remember when God called
[1:14:36] you maybe you've been reading a message
[1:14:38] book something spoke to you maybe you
[1:14:41] went to church you heard heard something
[1:14:44] that touched your heart still that's the
[1:14:46] Sheep heard calling you thank you Lord
[1:14:50] you heard his
[1:14:51] voice and I want to tell you
[1:14:54] here that even though we have many many
[1:14:57] voices in the land but the Sheep will
[1:15:00] identify the voice of the shepherd
[1:15:03] that's right regardless of the form the
[1:15:05] shepherd will take the tree sheep will
[1:15:09] identify the Shephard
[1:15:12] Voice Hallelujah but I want you to get
[1:15:15] something here be before you know that
[1:15:18] voice you must have heard it
[1:15:22] somewhere that's right because when you
[1:15:24] were in the mind of God sir he spoke to
[1:15:27] you you heard his voice you got
[1:15:29] acquainted of that voice in so much that
[1:15:32] whatever you'll
[1:15:33] be when you hear that voice you
[1:15:36] recognize that voice whether it's
[1:15:39] William Bram speaking it whether it's
[1:15:41] brother Ron preaching here whether it's
[1:15:44] another brother brother martin or
[1:15:45] another brother preaching here or the
[1:15:47] brother giving a testimony or a sister
[1:15:49] talking to you you can identify the the
[1:15:51] voice of the shepherd
[1:15:53] Hallelujah why because you heard it
[1:15:55] somewhere that's
[1:15:57] right and you have your
[1:16:02] representation I remember a friend of
[1:16:04] mine I can't remember was it me or my
[1:16:06] friend who one time in the
[1:16:09] Congo uh he made in kinasa because we
[1:16:11] used to live in province in bushay and
[1:16:13] at the certain time we been you know
[1:16:15] back and forth between bushay and kinasa
[1:16:18] so a friend of mine met another friend
[1:16:20] who he met long time ago so he thought
[1:16:24] that was his friend when the M were just
[1:16:26] shaking hands hey how you doing how you
[1:16:28] doing what's going on man long time how
[1:16:31] you doing how you doing so in the
[1:16:33] meantime picture was going through their
[1:16:35] minds trying to figure out where did I
[1:16:37] see him and both of them were struggling
[1:16:40] man long time wow man you get weight
[1:16:43] many time how you doing how you doing
[1:16:45] they been just
[1:16:46] struggling you see until one of them
[1:16:49] said okay how about this person he said
[1:16:51] who's who's that oh I no that was my Oh
[1:16:54] I thought that was see they thought they
[1:16:56] knew one another but they
[1:16:58] didn't you
[1:17:00] see
[1:17:02] so with us is a different story because
[1:17:06] we heard his voice before the foundation
[1:17:08] of the world thank you Lord
[1:17:11] amen and this is a
[1:17:13] predestination the Bible will prove it
[1:17:15] to us because if you
[1:17:21] see in John 10 where we read these Jews
[1:17:24] they came up to him they say tell us
[1:17:27] plainly if you if thou are the Christ
[1:17:30] tell us
[1:17:32] plainly don't keep us in in in
[1:17:36] confusion and Jesus
[1:17:39] said I told you and you believed
[1:17:43] not the works that I do in my father's
[1:17:47] name they bear witness of me in other
[1:17:50] words you don't get to know me by just
[1:17:52] me telling you I'm Jesus no it's by
[1:17:56] Revelation you can't you can't just know
[1:17:58] God like oh yeah this is brother so and
[1:18:00] so no it's not an originally person this
[1:18:04] is a great Majesty this is the creator
[1:18:06] of Heaven and the Earth amen this is God
[1:18:10] himself you have to know him by
[1:18:12] Revelation like Jesus said if you love
[1:18:16] the word of God if you love me my father
[1:18:19] and I will come and dwell in you we will
[1:18:21] come and reveal ourselves to you yes sir
[1:18:24] it's by Revelation it's not just by
[1:18:26] casually you know yeah I'm such and such
[1:18:29] brother no that's what they
[1:18:32] want and Jesus said but you believe not
[1:18:36] because you are not of my sheep as I
[1:18:39] said unto you my sheep hear my voice and
[1:18:43] I know them and they follow me amen when
[1:18:47] he came on the earth he preached the
[1:18:50] gospel the the Sheep heard heard his
[1:18:53] voice they followed him even before
[1:18:57] him since the time of
[1:19:00] Enoch the Sheep always hear the voice of
[1:19:03] the shepher when Enoch preached people
[1:19:07] believed it because they identified the
[1:19:08] voice of the shepherd coming through the
[1:19:11] preaching of
[1:19:12] Enoch throughout the ages the Sheep
[1:19:16] always identifi the voice of the sherp
[1:19:18] her why because they heard it before
[1:19:21] somewhere
[1:19:23] familiar places we heard it from the
[1:19:25] pastor familiar
[1:19:29] faces so these people here they didn't
[1:19:32] have any
[1:19:33] representation like brother bam says
[1:19:35] talked about the uh the woman at the
[1:19:38] well and the priest the priest didn't
[1:19:40] have any representation but the woman
[1:19:44] did like these people they didn't have
[1:19:46] any representation they were
[1:19:48] struggling and he he answered them he
[1:19:51] said no but my sheep no my
[1:19:53] voice I did everything for you to
[1:19:56] understand you didn't catch it I
[1:19:58] preached it I did the Miracles you
[1:20:00] didn't catch it so I can do other thing
[1:20:03] then just continue on right no tell us
[1:20:06] plainly if you are a Christ like brother
[1:20:09] bam says when Herod was trying
[1:20:12] to ask the uh the uh the Magi to when
[1:20:16] they go to visit the the the the baby
[1:20:19] they can come to him and tell him where
[1:20:22] the baby was born so that he can go and
[1:20:25] worship him too the angel of the Lord
[1:20:27] came by night to say no don't go back
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:30] way because he just said but in his
[1:20:33] heart that's right he's managing to kill
[1:20:36] the baby don't go that way even these
[1:20:39] people do you believe when they was
[1:20:41] asking Jesus tell us plainly if he had
[1:20:44] told them I'm Christ do you think they
[1:20:46] would have they would worship him
[1:20:49] no because with this attitude you can
[1:20:52] tell what is in their heart right they
[1:20:54] didn't have any
[1:20:56] representation they didn't make a choice
[1:20:58] over there of the way of life that's
[1:21:00] right they made a choice of the way of
[1:21:06] death
[1:21:09] so too many things to
[1:21:14] say in the message making the valley
[1:21:17] full of ditches preached in 1956 July
[1:21:21] the 28th B bam says
[1:21:24] this did you ever hear a goat
[1:21:28] blade a goat and a sheep is almost the
[1:21:31] same thing now I've heard goats
[1:21:35] crying when it act like
[1:21:38] sheep it takes a real sheep herd sir to
[1:21:42] know the difference oh Hallelujah do you
[1:21:44] hear a goat
[1:21:45] squiring it sounds just exactly like a
[1:21:49] sheep but a Shephard knows the voice
[1:21:54] because your name were
[1:21:56] written from before the foundation of
[1:21:58] the world praise the Lord and he knows
[1:22:02] you but the shepherd knows the voice
[1:22:04] that's right now but something
[1:22:08] happened let's skip this cuz we don't
[1:22:10] have that much time let's go
[1:22:16] down let's go read the or down the
[1:22:19] highlighted
[1:22:21] area and I said well then why is it that
[1:22:26] he's hurting the goat so he's talking
[1:22:28] about a man was asking try to find out
[1:22:31] what is what is it Shepherds means
[1:22:34] really yeah the shepherd is a is a
[1:22:37] grazer like he say say here like in
[1:22:39] America they call it Cowboy but bam says
[1:22:42] well then why is it that he's hurting
[1:22:45] the goats and everything he said that's
[1:22:48] right or I said I see and he said but
[1:22:52] brother Bram when the night time comes
[1:22:56] everything is left on the pasture except
[1:23:00] the
[1:23:01] sheep and the Sheep the sheep stucked in
[1:23:05] the fold and he lays down at the door to
[1:23:10] see that nothing bothers
[1:23:13] themall I say I
[1:23:16] see you can sit in the same church you
[1:23:19] can sit in the same church Shout by the
[1:23:22] same gospel but if your nature isn't
[1:23:26] different you'll never be recognized as
[1:23:29] a friend to the son that's right it's
[1:23:33] got to be in your heart not in your head
[1:23:36] amen so like many many have come to the
[1:23:39] message we believe the message Malachi 4
[1:23:42] and such and such but you can tell as
[1:23:45] the time goes on you can tell the
[1:23:49] difference we might come to the same
[1:23:52] church and and listen to the
[1:23:55] Ser sermons and things but if you go
[1:23:58] deep with that believing or that belief
[1:24:01] of the brother or sisters if you go deep
[1:24:03] with him you might you you might find
[1:24:05] something
[1:24:06] different just give it a time you will
[1:24:08] say
[1:24:10] it but it takes the true Shepherd to
[1:24:14] make a
[1:24:16] difference let's read in uh Matthew
[1:24:21] 28
[1:24:38] I don't know how the Lord is leading
[1:24:39] because there has too many stuff to go
[1:24:41] through but for the sake of the
[1:24:45] time this Matthew 20 not 28 27 I'm sorry
[1:24:49] 27 uh verse 50- 54
[1:25:00] verse 50
[1:25:01] 2750 Jesus when he had cried again with
[1:25:06] a loud voice yielded up The
[1:25:10] Ghost and behold the veil of the temple
[1:25:14] was rank in Twain From the top to the
[1:25:18] bottom and the Earth did quck and The
[1:25:22] Rock
[1:25:23] Rank and the graves were opened and many
[1:25:28] bodies of the saint which slept AR Rose
[1:25:32] and came out of the graves after his
[1:25:36] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:25:40] and appeared unto
[1:25:41] many now when the
[1:25:44] Centurion and they that were with him
[1:25:48] watching Jesus saw watching Jesus saw
[1:25:51] the earthquake quick and those things
[1:25:54] that were done they feared greatly
[1:25:57] saying
[1:25:59] truly this was the son of
[1:26:06] God we can have some you pray for me as
[1:26:10] we sink a little bit
[1:26:12] deep to get to see what the holy spirit
[1:26:15] is going to speak to us now here
[1:26:18] amen so this is to show you that
[1:26:23] regardless of your place you be the
[1:26:25] shepherd will come to
[1:26:27] you and will identify will locate you
[1:26:30] and will get to you to rescue you thank
[1:26:34] which means you cannot even backslide
[1:26:35] don't even try to
[1:26:39] backslide in heaven he was there when
[1:26:42] you want to come down on the earth he
[1:26:43] came down on the
[1:26:45] earth in hell he he went down in
[1:26:48] hell where can you go in the water
[1:26:52] Jonah tried one time he followed him in
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:55] water so there's no place you can go
[1:26:59] where the shepherd can get a hold of you
[1:27:01] thank you
[1:27:03] Lord we were put here on the earth we
[1:27:05] were lost he came
[1:27:09] down and when he was here down he
[1:27:12] preached he took the Amnesia away and
[1:27:16] before he went to rescue those that have
[1:27:19] died in faith all the sense in the Old
[1:27:22] Testament that have died in faith he had
[1:27:25] to give the key of heaven to
[1:27:29] Peter follow the wisdom of God
[1:27:32] here because God knows us
[1:27:35] well
[1:27:37] amen he couldn't give the key of of of
[1:27:39] hell and death to human being because
[1:27:42] guess what you don't believe like me
[1:27:44] like our pastor always say you out of
[1:27:46] [Laughter]
[1:27:48] here amen so you don't believe like me
[1:27:51] hell
[1:27:53] you see how many people have gone in
[1:27:55] hell if the key of hell and death was
[1:27:57] given to Peter but God gave him the key
[1:28:00] of life thank you Lord of
[1:28:04] Heaven the only thing you can do Peter
[1:28:07] is just send people to heaven the only
[1:28:09] thing you can do kneel down pray for
[1:28:13] them the only thing you can do console
[1:28:15] them bring consolation Comfort them pray
[1:28:19] for
[1:28:20] them no criticize
[1:28:23] you
[1:28:24] see so follow here now is our Lord is
[1:28:28] going now after he finished with the
[1:28:29] saint on the earth
[1:28:31] now he cried at the cross yielded The
[1:28:36] Ghost and what says from that per short
[1:28:39] period of time many prophecies have been
[1:28:43] fulfilled rapidly from Gan to the
[1:28:47] Cross so let's read the prophet here as
[1:28:50] we think in the
[1:28:53] water I can see him go up this is a
[1:28:55] glorified Jesus preaching
[1:28:59] 1955 February the
[1:29:01] 25th I can see him going up to the
[1:29:05] regions of of the lost to the to a door
[1:29:09] but bam
[1:29:10] knocks and opened the door they begin
[1:29:14] screaming and wailing and those Souls
[1:29:17] that repented not he said you have Enoch
[1:29:22] I am he that Enoch had spiritual
[1:29:25] revelation of I am he that was preached
[1:29:30] before the anian world the Lord shall
[1:29:35] descend with 10,000s of his
[1:29:38] Saints I am the Virgin born son of God
[1:29:42] and have died at
[1:29:44] Calvary to redeem the
[1:29:46] Lost why didn't you accept Enoch's
[1:29:50] message
[1:29:52] let's let's talk a little bit here you
[1:29:54] see for these people that have
[1:29:57] died that was
[1:29:59] lost they
[1:30:01] died Sinners they didn't have any
[1:30:07] representation what the prophet is
[1:30:08] telling us here God was presenting
[1:30:11] himself to them because they didn't have
[1:30:13] any
[1:30:14] picture they don't know the voice of the
[1:30:16] sheep heard they haven't heard it
[1:30:20] nowhere when they saw him com they
[1:30:22] didn't have any
[1:30:23] clue because if you meet somebody you
[1:30:26] you've never met before that person has
[1:30:28] to present himself to you amen I'm such
[1:30:31] person but if you have known that person
[1:30:34] when you see that person regardless of
[1:30:36] the the the clothes and whether he
[1:30:39] gained weight or he lost weight or
[1:30:40] whatever you still recognize that person
[1:30:44] Hallelujah but here the Lord was
[1:30:46] presenting
[1:30:48] himself I am he that Enoch preached why
[1:30:52] didn't believe Enoch because that was me
[1:30:55] that was
[1:30:58] preached so and the Lord shall descend
[1:31:01] so I read that
[1:31:03] already why didn't you accept Enoch's
[1:31:06] message under the burn under the burnt
[1:31:09] offering and the door was closed with a
[1:31:13] weeping and Howling and nashing of
[1:31:18] teeth on down the road demons he didn't
[1:31:23] have anything to do with demons cuz they
[1:31:24] lost already a long time ago he got to
[1:31:27] the very door of hell but bom
[1:31:31] knocks he knocked at the door the devil
[1:31:34] opened the door said well you finally
[1:31:38] arrived did you said I thought I had I
[1:31:42] heard you when I killed Abel I thought I
[1:31:44] heard you when I throw the Hebrew
[1:31:46] children in the Fe fiery
[1:31:50] finest I was positive I heard you when I
[1:31:53] beheaded John but after all you've
[1:31:56] arrived
[1:31:58] amen hallelujah here we see the nature
[1:32:02] of the Satan's
[1:32:05] Children that's right because you see he
[1:32:08] was hesitant sometimes he's Christ he
[1:32:11] can recognize this is Christ sometimes
[1:32:13] no he's not you see exactly what his
[1:32:17] children are doing today we believe the
[1:32:19] message tomorrow no it's not the
[1:32:23] true but the true sheep of God they will
[1:32:28] recognize the voice and stick to that
[1:32:31] voice all the way
[1:32:33] amen yes
[1:32:37] sir the devil was
[1:32:40] hesitant sometimes he could recognize
[1:32:42] thou are Christ sometimes in the temple
[1:32:45] and he shut his his mouth shut your
[1:32:47] mouth don't say anything right sometimes
[1:32:50] tell us why you keep us in the confusion
[1:32:53] for a long time tell us plainly if you
[1:32:54] are Christ you see the point sometimes
[1:32:57] he can see this is Christ sometimes he's
[1:33:00] hesitant exactly what he's doing in hell
[1:33:02] here he thought he killed him when he
[1:33:05] killed Abel he thought he killed him he
[1:33:08] so he was going on and on and on but he
[1:33:11] was positive when he beaded John that
[1:33:13] was Christ but finally he
[1:33:17] arrived Hallelujah you
[1:33:20] see
[1:33:23] I can hear him say Satan I just took the
[1:33:28] key and give it to the Apostle Peter for
[1:33:31] the kingdom of heaven but I come down to
[1:33:35] get the keys of death and hell and you
[1:33:39] are going to give them up am I can see
[1:33:42] him reach over there he said he said but
[1:33:46] wait wait a minute wait a minute there's
[1:33:48] a sin proposition you remember I called
[1:33:51] if to sin but he said just a minute I am
[1:33:55] the Virgin born Son of God the price has
[1:33:58] been paid my blood still wait on
[1:34:00] calvary's Cross you can't Bluff the
[1:34:03] people anymore I come to take over amen
[1:34:07] see him reaching over reach over there
[1:34:11] and Jake the keys off of his side hang
[1:34:14] them on his own side getting near
[1:34:17] daylight he's going back and he just
[1:34:21] started up now we're getting to another
[1:34:23] point now remember there's some more
[1:34:27] people that had
[1:34:29] Revelation job Abraham Isaac Jacob all
[1:34:34] those in Paradise could could uh
[1:34:37] couldn't go into the presence of his
[1:34:39] majesty because the blood of bull of
[1:34:42] bulls and
[1:34:43] Golds wouldn't take away sin it only
[1:34:47] covered
[1:34:48] it
[1:34:50] remember in a paradise where all the
[1:34:53] saints when the were dying were kept
[1:34:56] there and they've been bothered
[1:34:58] sometimes remember the the reach of
[1:35:01] Ender she went to call the spirit of uh
[1:35:05] Samuel and Samuel when he came he said
[1:35:08] why are you bothering me you see you've
[1:35:11] been bothered but we read here that the
[1:35:15] true Shepherd will take the Sheep when
[1:35:16] it's night time and put them in the ship
[1:35:19] fold and he will lay at the door so that
[1:35:23] nobody would bother them that's what
[1:35:26] he's doing here he went down to Hell to
[1:35:29] take those
[1:35:30] ship
[1:35:32] Sir take them out of there to bring them
[1:35:34] to the place where nobody would bother
[1:35:37] them because before his
[1:35:39] coming some witch could bother them of
[1:35:42] Ender she went to call on the spirit of
[1:35:44] Samuel and he said why did you bother me
[1:35:47] you see but after the death and
[1:35:49] resurrection of Jesus Christ he took all
[1:35:51] the Saint the place where they are now
[1:35:54] nobody can bother them if you want to
[1:35:56] come there you need to come to the
[1:35:58] shepher
[1:35:59] himself and he's there laying that's why
[1:36:02] he say no one can come to me unless my
[1:36:05] father will attract him thank you
[1:36:10] Lord so now we going
[1:36:12] to the place of those that had
[1:36:17] Revelation but now they can go the real
[1:36:21] SA rice the very uh predominating son of
[1:36:25] the Living God the son of the morning
[1:36:28] had come and died and the blood of God
[1:36:31] himself had paid the price hallelujah oh
[1:36:35] I feel
[1:36:36] religious notice I can see him knock at
[1:36:40] the door Abraham Sarah sitting back in
[1:36:44] there job and all all of them saying we
[1:36:49] you know I believe something took place
[1:36:51] Place upon the Earth while
[1:36:54] ago I can hear him knock at the door and
[1:36:58] they open up the door Abraham said Sarah
[1:37:01] look here here he is now you see the
[1:37:05] picture
[1:37:06] here Jesus didn't present himself they
[1:37:10] knew him amen because they saw him
[1:37:13] somewhere familiar places familiar faces
[1:37:17] familiar voices Hallelujah sir
[1:37:21] amen look here he is the Lamb that has
[1:37:25] been slain from the foundation of the
[1:37:27] world I can hear Daniel look out there
[1:37:31] and say wait a minute that's the stone I
[1:37:34] seen cut out of the mountain without a
[1:37:37] hands I can hear Ezekiel say I saw him
[1:37:40] like a cloud under his feet when he was
[1:37:44] coming I can hear job said I know my
[1:37:47] redeemer liveth amen and there he stands
[1:37:50] Hallelujah
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:53] see this is the proof of the
[1:37:58] predestination that's good and Jesus
[1:38:00] himself say don't despise these little
[1:38:03] ones don't belittle them because at
[1:38:06] least they have the bodies and he called
[1:38:10] he called it
[1:38:12] Angels the Angels is beholding the
[1:38:15] Father's face all the time don't
[1:38:18] belittle them don't despise them you
[1:38:21] have bodies waiting for
[1:38:24] you am this is the
[1:38:27] predestination so when you know where
[1:38:29] you came from you can know where you're
[1:38:32] going
[1:38:33] amen thank you Lord we know we come from
[1:38:36] the mind of God we came here for a
[1:38:39] moment for being
[1:38:42] tempted after that we're going to go
[1:38:44] back to him amen listen going back to
[1:38:47] him not his in his mind but in the
[1:38:50] bodies he has preped prepared for us to
[1:38:52] be together with him because we have
[1:38:54] been expressed already we were
[1:38:57] attributing his mind we were thought in
[1:38:59] his mind he expressed us we came down
[1:39:02] because we
[1:39:04] bypassed I forgot to tell you this we
[1:39:06] bypassed the body word the very body we
[1:39:09] are going into we bypassed it brother B
[1:39:12] said it in MC who is this MC he said we
[1:39:16] bypassed it Jesus Christ he came
[1:39:18] following the chronological order from
[1:39:22] the mind of God into the body word and
[1:39:25] then body of
[1:39:26] flesh but we came from attribute into
[1:39:30] this flesh cuz he breathed Us in the
[1:39:33] flesh and the human being became a
[1:39:35] living
[1:39:36] Soul because we bypass that because in
[1:39:40] this form of the word you know
[1:39:42] everything and Bam says when we go back
[1:39:44] to that body we will know everything we
[1:39:47] will look back and see what we did we
[1:39:49] can see everything how he rescued us how
[1:39:52] dangerous it was in on the earth we will
[1:39:55] look back because we'll be in the form
[1:39:56] of the
[1:39:57] word we will see everything that we have
[1:39:59] done in the past Hallelujah so that's
[1:40:02] where we going we're going to that body
[1:40:05] to our
[1:40:12] theophanies he continued to say the
[1:40:15] Patriarchs and the prophets answering to
[1:40:17] him I can hear him say get ready
[1:40:20] children

[1:40:24] you come God's provided way and I've
[1:40:27] made a way now you are going back to

[1:40:53] Visions he said sure I'm going to be
[1:40:57] there for several days talking to my
[1:41:01] other
[1:41:02] disciples now we're going to the New
[1:41:05] Testament because those in the Old
[1:41:07] Testament they died under the
[1:41:10] faith now the faith is paying now cuz
[1:41:13] the shepherd came down to where they
[1:41:14] were to take them

[1:41:24] things of the kingdom of God I've got to
[1:41:27] anoint them and the Holy Spirit coming

[1:41:41] angels and here I want you to notice
[1:41:43] something before Jesus died that one of
[1:41:48] the thieves on the cross I believe the
[1:41:50] one to the right side the one who said

[1:45:21] host Mighty in battle the angel pressed
[1:45:24] the button the gates lifted up Jesus and
[1:45:28] the Old Testament Saint walked right
[1:45:31] down through the seity of Jerusalem
[1:45:34] Hallelujah the
[1:45:35] Conqueror all the
[1:45:38] saints are following him walked up to
[1:45:41] the to the throne and presented them say
[1:45:45] here they are
[1:45:47] father remember last
[1:45:49] time
[1:45:53] let's read in uh is is my last
[1:45:56] one let's read in
[1:45:58] uh Isaiah
[1:46:14] 55
[1:46:19] 55:1
[1:46:22] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:46:26] of my
[1:46:28] mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:46:33] void but it shall accomplished that
[1:46:37] which I pleased and I shall
[1:46:40] prosper in the thing where I where to I
[1:46:45] sent it amen remember last
[1:46:48] time God sent his word and his word
[1:46:51] won't return unto him void he has to be
[1:46:55] prosperous and remember Jesus praying
[1:46:58] was giving the report to the Lord I
[1:47:01] didn't lose none of them Hallelujah
[1:47:03] outside of the the son of piic Judah but
[1:47:08] the rest of them I didn't lose none of
[1:47:11] them he was giving the report but
[1:47:15] tonight he's presenting them to the
[1:47:19] father when he took them from
[1:47:23] Paradise on the earth and in the
[1:47:27] presence of God cuz he's the word he
[1:47:31] could not return back to God without
[1:47:34] accomplish that which he was
[1:47:37] sent Hall last time we saw he gave the
[1:47:41] report but tonight he brought them and
[1:47:44] we read it somewhere here he said he has
[1:47:46] to come on the earth to give the new
[1:47:48] testament's instructions
[1:47:50] because I have to come back again to
[1:47:54] them brothers and sisters you saw in the
[1:47:57] Old Testament they died on
[1:47:59] faith he rescued them now they are in
[1:48:03] the immortal bodies tonight but we have
[1:48:07] a promise that he is coming back again
[1:48:09] for us
[1:48:11] hallelujah since he fulfilled it for the
[1:48:13] Old Testament Saint he's more than able
[1:48:16] to fulfill it for us that's right amen
[1:48:23] and now when brother bam says people
[1:48:27] always believe in the promise of what
[1:48:29] God will do in the future and also they
[1:48:32] believe in what he has done in the past
[1:48:34] but always miss to see what he's doing
[1:48:38] now because these
[1:48:41] Saints
[1:48:44] acquainted they have they are familiar
[1:48:47] with these Prophecies of David
[1:48:50] it they heard it many times but when it
[1:48:54] was taking place they could
[1:48:57] recognize and were responding to the the
[1:48:59] Angels but look at the other side these
[1:49:04] people that didn't have any
[1:49:07] representation they knew the songs of
[1:49:09] David David uh in the Psalms
[1:49:12] 22 when Christ was crying was Eli Eli on
[1:49:17] the cross they didn't even catch
[1:49:19] anything
[1:49:21] they know the song of of David but the
[1:49:25] prophecy was taking place now they
[1:49:27] didn't recognize it because they didn't
[1:49:29] have any representation in their heart
[1:49:31] amen you see the difference
[1:49:34] now this is the proof of
[1:49:37] predestination these one they have
[1:49:39] representation these one they have
[1:49:41] Immortal bodies these one they are the
[1:49:43] sh the the sheep of the sharp her they
[1:49:46] heard the voice
[1:49:48] somewhere here on the Earth they
[1:49:50] recognize the
[1:49:53] voice brothers and sisters regardless of
[1:49:56] all the voices going on in the
[1:49:59] land the true sheep of the lord of the
[1:50:03] great Shepherd will always identified
[1:50:06] the voice of the great Shepherd amen
[1:50:09] thank you Lord and he says no one can
[1:50:13] plug them
[1:50:14] out the pastor was here trying to keep
[1:50:18] us with the Baton or The Rock and the
[1:50:21] staff don't go this way don't go that
[1:50:23] way try to say in the middle amen that's
[1:50:28] right so if you see
[1:50:31] people going away leaving the
[1:50:33] message you can tell
[1:50:36] yourself if they had representation or
[1:50:40] not because Jesus said no one will plug
[1:50:45] them out of my hand praise the Lord
[1:50:47] because my father and I we are one
[1:50:50] amen no one will pluck them out of the
[1:50:52] hand regardless of what kind of
[1:50:54] preaching will come
[1:50:56] remember
[1:50:59] um brother bam spoke of
[1:51:02] uh what is the mountain he was writing
[1:51:07] meditating on the word and the enemy
[1:51:09] showed himself up dressed up as if he
[1:51:12] was God Jesus crowned
[1:51:16] already Martin could recognize says the
[1:51:19] scriptures going through his mind
[1:51:20] quickly say no no no no no he's not
[1:51:22] crowned yet you see that's the true
[1:51:26] sheep but what I'm say he took the in or
[1:51:29] with the ink or something he has get out
[1:51:31] of here you see so you need to have
[1:51:36] confidence in this world of God Amen I
[1:51:40] believe with all my heart but regardless
[1:51:42] of who will bring any Doctrine any other
[1:51:45] voice you will by God grace recognize
