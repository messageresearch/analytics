us in his hour and we're so grateful so thankful for that privilege this morning amen I love him I appreciate him I enjoy just the atmosphere he's here amen I trusted you that you have the sense spiritually to sense his presence is here this morning and where he's at him and I believe there's going to be Victory there's going to be help there's going to be strength someone is going to walk away from here with Victory this morning a touch this morning whatever did you have need of I believe he's here to meet that need amen praise the Lord amen while you're standing just turn with me over to the book of Nehemiah the fourth chapter certainly counted an honor and a privilege to be here and uh very very humbling to stand before you this morning I count myself the least of all the brethren but I have a big God a God that's not stopped working still on the move still changing lives he still heals the sick amen so whatever you haven't eat off this morning I believe he's available to do what you have you don't have a thank brother Ron for giving me this opportunity and certainly you know I I'm content to come and see it with you and enjoy and worship with you and that's that's no problem for me I like it I know you know brother Ron can identify some of you Minister Brothers it's nice sometimes you just go on a vacation you know if if you have something like this before you you know it kind of keeps you a little bit under the pressure so you maybe not enjoy things as much as you would but I I tell you what there's nothing that I enjoy More Than This presence amen that is that is just wonderful praise the Lord and just a gift that you have let's just start here Nehemiah the fourth chapter I want to read the first eight verses and then we'll go to the Lord in prayer it says if it came to pass when sambalot heard that we build the wall he was Wrath and took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spanked before his brethren in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves with a sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned now to buy his ammonite was by him and he said even that which they built if a fox go up he shall even break down their Stonewall hear o Our God for we are despised and turn the reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together into the half thereof for the people had a mind to work but it came to pass when similar and tobiah and the Arabians and the ammonites and the ashtonites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped as they were very rough and they conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it let's just buy our hearts Heavenly Father we just humble ourselves before you Lord is that wonderful song that we sung that chorus Lord without you we're nothing and you told us plainly in your word in John the 15th chapter of the doubt you we can do nothing but Lord we're all so so glad that through the scripture you've also revealed that we can do all things through you dear Lord for we know that it's you that does the work and it's not us it's not our ability it's not our strength dear Lord our gift as the prophet said was giving ourselves out of the way so that you may come and we could just be a channel that you could move through that you could speak through the Lord and we asked him this morning you would be so wonderfully gracious unto us and Lord you would come and you would bring forth your word and you would speak to our hearts Lord and that your word would be nourishment to our souls Lord we thank you for that your lord just uh we just surrender ourselves to you and we ask you to bless your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated this morning I just want to say before we get into the word of the Lord this morning that what a what a that was one of the greatest privileges one of the greatest honors for our sister Flo to come up and and wait to sing that song when we hear that I mean that was to me that was an honor and I appreciate that and those words are so perfect and and uh you know I was thinking when she was singing I said oh there's that that thought's buried here in the word this morning and uh that was certainly a privilege for me and now if you come this morning looking for brother Andrew Glover he's not here as he said Wednesday night I've known brother Andrew for a long time I remember him preaching and he was still younger than his shoe size which is like a 19. so you know I thought well one of these days when he's older than his shoe size he's really going to preach and and uh so that that's not me but hey when I grow up that's how I want to preach but I still got about four inches to go I'm getting there I'm getting there but so it was uh it was wonderful I'm not that I'm kind of like brother Ron said Wednesday night I don't listen fast enough he reads quotes faster than I can preach so uh but it was it was a tremendous blessing and so but you know what God has caught us each one different we're not all the same and he's got a purpose and and I believe God is just as much God this morning his word is just as real this morning as it was Wednesday night he's just as capable of coming and meeting you blessing you touching you as he was Wednesday night or any other time amen we're not looking at the man you don't look at the man if you look at me you'll be very very disappointed but if you look to Jesus Christ will never let you down he'll never disappoint you praise God and he's the one I am depending on now this morning as we look at the word of the Lord I'll tell you I I thought I think hey this is Palm Sunday Lord let me preach behold the king cometh or let me preach an Easter message or whatever but the Lord just kept bringing me back to this thought and I couldn't get away from this and I think it is something that is so applicable to every single one of us it doesn't matter how much Revelation that you have it doesn't matter how many quotes that you know that's all good right we all want those things but yet you're still fighting a battle and we find here where we took the story from Nehemiah let me just let me just give a little backdrop if I could to bring us up to this fourth chapter of Nehemiah we find it we remember this is when the Jews have been taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar they've been taken to Babylon and that Jerusalem had been destroyed the Palaces the temple and the walls have been broken down and burned and Jerusalem was left in disaster and we know brother Andrew bought it out Wednesday night but the books amen that Daniel had Revelation it was going to be 70 years of the Captivity and we find here they're coming down to the end of that captivity and there's a map of the name of Nehemiah that is a cut buyer to the King of Persia Arthur Xerxes and that as he's in the palace and shushan then all of a sudden there comes some of the Jews from Judah unto the palace and Nehemiah sees as these Jews that he begins to inquire them he says what about the RAM and what about those that are into captivity what about the the condition of Jerusalem tell me about it you know there was something in Hebrew wanted to know what was going on and so Hannah and I and them they began to tell him hey here's what's going on it's the city is in rubbish the walls are broken down the uh the people are in a horrible desolate condition and so on and immediately the Bible tells us that that Nehemiah began to seek the Lord he began to mourn he began to fast he began to pray because of the condition that Jerusalem was in his heart was broken he was burdened about this and it says the next time that you go to the second chapter you find out did he goes in before the king amen but yet he's stealing mourning and the King notices the sadness that Nehemiah was displaying and he recognized hey this isn't the way that this man usually is and he began to ask hey Nehemiah what's going on what's wrong you you've never been like this before what's happening so Nehemiah began to unburden himself before the king uh you know here's the condition some of my brethren come and here's the condition of the sepulchers of my fathers and and it's in Rome and and so forth and and so the king says hey what what can we do about this and so Nehemiah had a bird not just I'm concerned about something but I want to do something also and so the king said hey you know what I'll send you to Jerusalem and and I'll send you with letters that you can get the materials that you can do a work of rebuilding the walls around Jerusalem and so we find out that that's where we kind of come to amen that here's Nehemiah he's come and he's rebuilding these walls and uh he's come uh he's come to to do this work and it tells us that third chapter that is he met with the uh the elders and the priests and so forth of Jerusalem in that desolate condition that they begin to to get divvy out who's going to do what part part who's going to do you know everybody everybody's got a part to play and who's going to do this work who's going to do this portion it's going to begin to divide it out and it began the construction rebuilding the walls and so we come down to this fourth chapter and we find out here as they began the work that there was a man by the name assemble all amen which was a honorite of of Moab he wasn't a Jew and he begins to mock them the Bible tells us here we'll begin to to read amen that they were under great indignation and they mocked the Jews and they began to say things and say what do these feeble Jews what do they do what do they think that they're doing and they will they fortify themselves with a sacrifice will they revive the stones out of the rubbish is this what they think they're going to rebuild this city that's been destroyed is that what they're intentious now listen here's Nehemiah he and the Jews that are working they're hearing what is being said they're hearing this this is you know because he begins to repeat to God you know what they're doing they're mocking us they're making fun of us they're making fun of the word so it wasn't that sambalod and tobiah and these uh these individuals are out whispering and saying these things you know somewhere where they can't be heard no they're saying them out intentionally so that the Jews those doing the work would hear what was being said and I want to take a thought this morning if I could I don't know if he put it on the screen but psychological warfare psychological warfare at the end time oh man that's where we're living that's why I say I believe this thought this morning is applicable to every one of us regardless of how much you know how much Revelation you have how many quotes how long you've been serving the lord I believe that we're all involved in a psychological warfare that is going on and that's where Nehemiah was at he was in a psychological warfare the enemy's saying things he's talking and and and telling things now this word is psychological warfare it's actually a it's a defined term and it is the plan tactical use of non-combat techniques to otherwise uh influence the thinking or behavior of an enemy now that's the definition that you love for psychological warfare it says to affect to otherwise influence the thinking or behavior of an enemy now that is again that's if you go look up that definition that's going to give you but my thought is just a little bit different it says it's not or otherwise influence of thinking our Behavior that's not what Satan's doing Satan is wanting a man to influence the thinking so he can affect the behavior you know that's what he's doing that's what the psychological warfare and that's why Sam Malone and these guys who wanted these feeble Jews think they're going to do they're going to revive out of this rubbish and suddenly we're saying these things to try to discourage them to try to make them think hey the effort is too big the the battle is too hard the the hill is too high to climb don't try don't bother that was that was a psychological warfare but I want you to know something here whenever uh Nehemiah and these Jews they heard these things you know what Nehemiah didn't go face to face with symbol out he didn't go over and say Hey I want to argue with you I want to debate with you amen I want to you know I'm gonna argue this point with you that was not his tactic his tactic was he went to the Lord he began to pray he began to seek the Lord in behalf hey we're under attack amen they're coming against us so it wasn't that he was going to argue you're not ever going to I'll argue the devil you don't do it you know hey you can't argue somebody and with them to the Lord I guess when I was young Chris I thought you know hey I've got some Revelation here let me let me start proving to uh this good Baptist friend or whatever it might have been let me let me begin to show them and you begin to argue you know what you don't win anybody by arguing that just you know this drives them further back and you can't beat the devil with arguing with him and so Nehemiah he he didn't take that tactic I'm going to argue that with him I'm going to debate with him he's he went he began to pray and it says that after they prayed Amen in the sixth verse so so built with the wall and all the walls joined together into the hath there also half done except for the people that are mine to work every pastor wants people with mind to work everybody wants a a congregation that has a desire to do something to accomplish something to be about amen or establishing the kingdom of God Amen that's what we desire and so here it is the people had that mind to work and because they were doing the work the Bible says that when Sam alone Tobias the Arabians and then those that with them when they saw what was going on that you know they're they're playing tactic of uh the psychological warfare began to happen amen that they uh they were very rough and it conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and he entered see that's what Satan's tactic is whenever he begins to try to come against you with putting thoughts in your mind amen is to hinder the work hinder what you're doing for almighty God now listen if you want to be a part of a softball league or whatever Satan he'll Pat you on the back and he'll buy you a new glove but if you want to do the work of the Lord I'm going to tell you something he's going to do all that he can to try to hinder you he's going to put every thought in your mind and some of you can identify with this you had a desire to do something for almighty God and the devil starts dealing with you telling you you can't do it you're not good enough whatever right have you ever felt maybe just in inspired of the Lord amen just to go pray for somebody you just thought hey that person's down discouraged you know I just want to go pray for him and immediately that devil starts to oh who Do You Think You Are you're not good enough what are they going to say you lay your hands on on them or you call uh uh pray for them or whatever see that psychological warfare he's trying to affect your behavior he's trying to get into your mind Amen to keep you the hint of the word to keep you from doing what God has ordained you to do what God has asked you to do amen and so if he can get a foothold into your mind amen he begins to control things yeah Paul kind of dealt just a little bit with this in Romans the seventh chapter and he he says in the 23rd verse this is such an interesting chapter but he says in the 23rd verse he says but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me to Camp give you the law of sin which is in my members and so there's another war going on here in the mind and one of the translations says but there's another power within me that is at war with my mind another translation says Waging War against the law of my mind and so there's a Warn and we all know that right we're all we've all seen that we've all been involved in that in fact brother Ram talked about in the the greatest battle ever fought I got some uh uh quotes uh pulled out of that message in 161st uh paragraph he says open up that mind that's the battlefield there is where the battle sets an array right there in the front line your mind I mean it's psychological warfare that's where it's taking place and you open up the Mind amen it depends on what you open it up to amen and so the enemy wants you to give him ear to the that he can get into this battlefield in the 111th verse brother Graham says see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true these battles has raged since the days of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's word but he white washed it that's what he's still doing right he started this at the beginning he's had thousands of years of practice and you are now in the middle of this battle he goes on to stay down in 115th bear gray says the battle Rags when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning so that's where Satan wants you to go I want you to start reasoning things instead of taking God at his word brother Robert gave a little testimony there of uh of what Josiah is going through and and put him took him to the hospital because the new artists wanted to scan the brain to see if there's there's things going on in the first scan there was nothing the second scared I think the 24-hour period was over and then as Josiah was waking up out of sleepy he he had this event or what incident whatever it was and they said we couldn't find it on EEG that there was anything there and when Sharon was telling me that I guess she'd got it from being this one that says hey you know what it's nothing but the devil but our problems a lot of times I mean we want to look at it from a purely human standpoint of what is this what is causing this amen that's what's Satan that's the game that Satan wants you to play he wants you to begin a reason in your mind what is this statement when sometimes we just got to say it's nothing but the devil this is Satan Satan trying to attack Satan trying to destroy amen but we know that Satan is a liar right amen Brethren goes on to say in the the 214th verse of the greatest battle ever fall he said listen at him now just how nasty he gets and how he whitewashes that word what's he trying to do get into her mind see he's talking to her after the word was already fortified there so Satan recognizes amen that is you as a believer that you've got the word you have revealed word you had true amen but he still begins to play in the mind right he still wants to put these thoughts in your mind and if Satan can capture your mind if he can capture your thoughts if you if he can just get that for just a few minutes amen then he will begin to mentally torture you he'll put everything now if you can control your thoughts he can control your emotions and ultimately your actions if he can if he can Captivate the thoughts amen if he can get into thoughts amen he begins to control that amen he can get you to accept a sickness or affliction you know we began to reason began to think that it's you know well Grandma amen she had cancer Uncle blue he he had diabetes and so you know it's in the family there's a family history and I said what's Satan doing he's playing psychological warfare with you amen all of a sudden you get a little rash on her skin oh that's melanoma hey man you know you you all these things he began to do they begin to control the thoughts and he'll convince you that you're sick he'll convince you that you're defeated he'll convince you that you're not loved that nobody cares about you that you're not worthy that you're not good enough That's what Satan wants to do he wants to get into mind so that you have that defeated mentality that you don't look at yourself as a writer Jesus Christ you know look at yourself amen as word amen you look at yourself as a defeated person if you were he gets into Divine amen if you were really a Son of God if you were really a part of the mind of Jesus Christ amen you wouldn't have this you wouldn't do this amen that psychological warfare he's trying to control he's trying to control your thoughts amen because what he does he controls your emotions and he'll overwhelm you and despair and discouragement and that's the battle that we Face saving that's what we have to go through amen when the enemy keeps bringing things before us hey man we've got a we gotta right now say I'm not looking to that I'm not looking I'm looking to the word of God I'm looking to the the truth praise God Amen so you know you'll overwhelm he'll break your spirit you know if you can if you just get if you can just get an audience who's in your thought process in that Battlefield if he could just get onto that Battlefield and get you to step on that Battlefield with him but then he begins to do these things Paul wrote to the church at thessalonica second Thessalonians the second chapter the second verse he says that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither my spirit nor by word nor by a letter from us as that day of Christ's hand now for the first six thousand years basically of History psychological warfare was swayed by a spirit which still is today you know that Spirit coming and Whispering something in your mind trying to convince you deceive you whatever it is but Paul said he said by Spirit nor by word and we know that's not referring to as the word of God that this word the written word or a form of word amen communication gossip people talking amen or by letters so for the first six thousand years are there about amen it was the psychological warfare was you know a spirit coming uh or you maybe reading a letter or somebody talking that was that was their that was his tactics that was his Weaponry but we come around to the 20th century and the next thing you know you got a a telephone and then you know it evolves into radio broadcast and radio and and then from there into television and from there into computers and you know when I was young I when I was young that was a long time ago growing up in a good Methodist home uh not message Methodist home we had a TV and we we it's a black and white television and we got one channel and if you wanted to watch TV on Saturday night you watched Lawrence Welk and black and white some of you were laughing because you're old enough to know who Lawrence Welk is some of you young people's like I have no clue what you're talking about hey man so but it's come a long way right so here's television we know how the prophet of God preached against television but you know it didn't stop there amen it evolved into computers and from a computer into the internet and from an internet into social media amen so that everybody's carrying around in their pocket at any point in time of the day amen you can be out hiking in a desert and and you've got access to what's going on around the world so this becomes Satan's super weapons I'm not just that reading a letter well I got a letter from from Gertrude and she's telling me here all the things that's going on no no no no I mean when it's happening around the world Amen you're knowing about it immediately and you know I believe that some people are a little bit too engaged in CNN are fox or whoever else you want to call it amen they want to know and and you know what that is a lot of times that's just feeding that's just feeding the doubts it's feeding the fears it's feeding listen if if I believe that everything that I'm listening to and watching hey I'd be building a a nuclear bomb shelter in my backyard but thank God I have Revelation that before that first Bob ever Falls we're going to be out of here amen right amen so I'm not looking to that you've got to be careful of what you're looking at what you're listening to but Satan has all this amen for people to focus on all these things that he's now battling your mind with feeling your mind full so hey we go Lord bring me back to the word of God bring me back to the truth bring me back to the message amen bring me back to Revelation and not what the world is saying because if that gets in you know it begins to affect you they got little sister at church I mean she'll she'll get uh she'll get on her computer and she'll start looking at all the latest news and then she'll walk into church and her head is just like this and I kid you not she walks in a church like this I don't know how she don't bump into the wall and I I looked I said hey oh she's been on the internet again listening to all the you know it's having effect on her so you gotta watch us that's exactly what Satan wants say man you know hey the black dog or the white dog which one are you feeding right I mean which one is which one are you giving something to amen which one's going now we go back over here to Nehemiah and it says in the ninth verse we didn't read this at the beginning but he says in the next verse says nevertheless we made our prayers unto God and set watch against them day and night because of them now so here it is they threat we're going to hinder the work we're going to do what we can to hinder this work foreign they went to prayer let's consult the Lord let's talk to the Lord about it but it says in a 10th verse says and Judah said the strength of the Bears of burden is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall now this was a samelot this was some of the enemies this was Judah they had heard enough amid all of a sudden now they're saying hey we can't do this if Satan can feel your mind full of rubbish he will Decay your strength if he can get your mind full of so much things that's going on in the world Amen he will Decay your strength will be diminished amen so here it is they began look at that begin to hold my it's just too big the task is too much it's it's too hard you know how how many times have we looked at that and we believe that and maybe we even looked at someone and thought wow they've gone too far they've done too much you know I give up hope on that well you know I've seen people like that amen that I had given up hope on that it had been in years and drugs and years and and just the garbage of the world and all of a sudden when I thought there's no hope there was no way amen all of a sudden God reached down to that person and God said let me show you what I can do amen it's not too hard for me it's not too difficult for me amen so don't look at the circumstance look at your God Amen look at the one you're serving look at the words you call the king of glory because he can change things right no matter what the circumstance or situation is he's great later than that so don't let it decay your strength if you're looking at the rubbish it will do that listen one day uh there in a storm and a boat here's the disciples and they think they're going down and they look out and here comes Jesus walking on the water and Peter gets folded and said Lord if that's you let me come on the Water by faith Peter got out of that boat but whenever he began to look at the circumstance he didn't want he didn't stay afloat right he began to sink when he got his eyes off the word when he goes I've lost the Jesus Christ and he began to look how the wind was blowing in the waves and and all that when he began to look at the circumstances he said That's what Satan again that's what he wants to do he wants you to focus on the circumstance not on the word not on the answer amen but the circumstance are too great The problem is too big it is not too big for God nothing is impossible to them that believe Hallelujah we've got to be the ones that's believing we got to be standing on the unadulterated word of almighty God if there's anybody on Earth today that should be standing on the word it ought to be the Bride of Jesus Christ because we become the word right amen so how can we deny the word and when we're listening to what Satan is saying amen instead of the word hey man they were operating on his Battleground it goes on in this 11th verse excuse me he goes on in hell yeah that's better well it's dry out here y'all know it's dry out here you know I don't ever think about that get up here preaching I'm like man I I've got cotton balls coming out cotton balls do not come from Louisiana but in 11th verse it says and are at the series said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease now I want you to know something terrorists didn't start on 9 11. because this verse right here tells us they had terrorism terrorists amen back here nehemiah's Damon they're not going to know the answer we're going to come in a Muslim or we'll sleep in there amen and they're not going to know what happened until he destroyed the work I mean so he caused the work deceased again that was the whole tactic of the enemy amen is to cause the work of God to cease amen so we see this I mean if you're listening to the enemy the Bible tells us first Timothy 4th chapter the first verse now the spirits speak expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils I mean so somebody's going to listen to that that gave heed to it and when it began to listen to it it began to have an effect upon them amen so that now they've and we've known right we've seen people that have fallen away people that used to work for worship amongst that you would have never imagined amen but yet they went out there to one of those super weapons of Satan of the psychological warfare to the internet and to begin to listen to things on the internet they begin to watch things on the internet and believe in a sign they don't believe a sign amen they move thought something false right and so giving heed to seducing spirits you know you hear a brother fall away you know he says well listen just he said just go out and listen I said no I'm not I'm not doing that I'm not going to give heed to seducing Spirits I'm not going to listen to doctrines of devils I'm not going to give ear to that amen there's enough psychological warfare why would I submit myself to those things I want to submit myself to the spirit of God to the word of almighty God let that be in me let that have control over me amen let that rule and write to me I don't need to feel my mind full of things amen that's gonna the devil's gonna feed our father or he's going to use against me okay remember they were listening they heard the adversaries they're giving heed into seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and they departed from the faith so it happens and we know that it's going to happen it has happened but God forbid that we should be a casualty we should be a victim I didn't come as far to be a victim I didn't come this car far to be a casualty in this psychological warfare amen amen I think we're almost out of here amen and I'm not giving up now amen I'm not turning in now amen I'm not laying down my armor now praise God but I'm Gonna Stand and I'm going to fight with the word of almighty God Amen because I know that it's going to be over one of these days I don't want to be a statistic oh that was the one who fell away but in the the 11th verse says their adversary said in a 12th verse it says and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times not just once but ten times oh from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon you so it was the Jews it was savings because they heard the adversaries saying it the Jews that dwelt by them so this is really important that if you have to be careful who you're hanging around with because there's going to be some people out there it's going to fill your mind all they call themselves Christians they maybe once they believed right oh they but the Jews which dwelt by them they dwelt by the adversaries they heard what the adversaries were saying and now they're repeating what the adversary said you know how Satan does it amen he wants to he wants you to repeat what the internet says you know an amazing today that you can take a picture or something with Google and he'll identify and so bye and it'll take you to some website that you can find out more information and and if oh this is terrible this is bad this is all this is oh hey I got a God that's bigger than that amen I've got a God that has dealt with harder than that amen right amen so here it is the Jews which dwelt by then be careful who your young people be careful who you hang around with because they'll start telling you things and they're saying you know you're repeating what they're saying instead of repeating what the word of God said instead of saying thus saith the Lord you're repeating what somebody else says about a situation I'm not interested what somebody else thinks about it I want to know what the Lord says about it you know I don't go out here looking for counterfeit money oh let me go out here brother let me go ahead and see if I can find some counterfeit twenty dollar bills I mean I'm not interested in counterfeit I want the real thing I want what's real amen and that's the way we should be we're interested in the truth amen not something that the enemy is trying to perpetrate not something lies that the enemy's trying to tell amen I don't have time for that amen so here they are they're repeating it oh they're going to be upon you you think you've got it all in control they're going to be upon you it says they're the 13th verse says therefore I said in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher place that I even set the people out to their families with their swords with their Spears with the rose and silver rings he said he said a watch let's watch him and let's watch to see him I'm not gonna let you to be just come in and take my children away come in and destroy our home and destroy our lives and come into the church and do these things every once while you know what the pastor has to do said this person's causing problems you know you probably better off down the road somewhere yeah I had a brother he asked me to come preach and brother Ron I I trust I'm not trying to do this wouldn't do this I shouldn't even tell this let me just forget that now you're curious aren't you now you're curious had a brother he he had taken over a a denominational church had asked me they'd left the denomination and asked him to come pastor and he's pastor and he asked me to come down preach for him so I went and preached for him and walked into church and and you know it's it's a group that hears some of the women in pants and her hair is cut off and different things and some of them you know have actually have on dresses he's trying to minister his group and there's this one elderly woman there that was I could tell she is a she's the matriarch of the church she was walking around and telling everybody and doing this in forest service and all these things and and uh you know I thought man she's in control of this thing and I told everyone hey I said he said I preached the word and preached the word and after I think after three years she finally got the hint left I said brother from the first time I preached her I was trying to get rid of her because I recognize that that was a problem she wanted to be in control she wanted to dictate what was happening in the church I could see that so I said hey I was hoping she you know either get right or get out right I mean that's kind of the way it comes down to it get it or get out even don't just sit there and be a problem amen so sometimes he just like hey you know if you're not going to get into this thing if you're not going to put your shoulder to the wheel if you're not going to believe the word of God if you're not going to believe the truth if you're not going to conform to the word of God Amen after a certain time hey amen adios amen I mean sometimes it's better right I'm a no-go pastor we want to keep everybody but sometimes it's better to say hey Hit the Road Jack and don't look back right amen just keep going just keep going amen so so sometimes that becomes fun but he said in the 14th verse let me get back to the word of God I shouldn't have got awful man Nehemiah y'all got to baptism Nehemiah 4 chapter the 14th verse and I looked and Rose up and uh and said unto the Nobles into the rulers into the rest of the people be not afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible remember the Lord don't don't think about them don't dwell on them remember the Lord which is terrible great and terrible and fight for your brethren for your sons and for your daughters for your wives and for your houses you've got something to fight for brothers of this assembly you've got something to fight for you look around at your children you look around your wines you look around your family you look around at your home saying you've got something to fight this devil far amen don't you let down the standard don't you let down the guard don't you let that enemy into your home amen fine David said fight for your brethren amen fight for your your families your children your wives and your houses put up a fight amen down in the 17th verse it says they which spilled on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so builded and that he sounded the trumpet was by me and so you know what we're going to fight but we're going to keep we're going to be prepared to fight but we're going to keep working see this the devil wants to do this the psychological warfare again the hinder the work of God to keep you from doing what the Lord is designated for you to do to get you distracted from the things of almighty God right amen so if he can get you distracted from him amen you may be standing there amen ready to fight but the work's not getting done BMI said hey we're going with one hand we're going to hold the Sword and the other hand we're going to get this work done hey man we're going to do it one way if we're going to have to do it one-handed we're going to do it if but we're going to be prepared to fight amen and listen the enemy will will he'll push you around and he will bully you as long as you let him but whenever you show that devil that you're prepared to stand and fight the devil don't want to fight because he already knows how that ends he already knows who wins that fight so he don't want to fight and I want you to know something you read the rest this you read chapter five amen this week go on hey he never they never did attack them why because they were prepared to fight and when you're prepared to fight against the enemy amen then the enemy said oh I don't think I want to pick that fight today see he's he's all buff right amen he's Bluff he's all boo but when you begin to boo back ain't even all of a sudden amen he don't want any part of that when you begin to when you began to take the word of God when you began to take the sword of the spirit amen the devil don't want any part of that right now this this is the word of God but whenever all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord comes upon you this becomes a sword it goes from a word to a sword right and the enemy don't want any part of that he knows that it is defeated he's defeated by that word amen and so he don't want any part of it so that's exactly amen whenever Nehemiah said hey we'll work with one hand hold a sword the other hand they never did attack where was where were they all at now now you know our sister flows she sang a song of those in that song it referenced back to Goliath and I always I I you know you can't help but love the story of dating your life but do you know that Goliath was psychological warfare it's big oh he's trying to induce fear and it worked right he got into mind see the Goliath was easily defeated God says let me take my smallest untrained Shepherd boy here he's not a trained soldier he's not a warrior let me take my smallest Shepherd boy here amen he don't have armor he don't have a sword he don't have a bow he don't have a spear obvious God's a sling and those five Stones let me take that though that that little chef boy and I'll show you amen what's going to happen to that giant that is attacking you amen Goliath with psychological warfare Goliath was easily defeated but the fear of Goliath was not see that's what was Conquering the army of Israel it wasn't glad it was the fear of Goliath and that's what Satan wants to do to you amen he wants to intimidate you so that you don't fight you don't take a stand amen you won't stand for what you believe or what the truth is or you will you will stand for the promises of God you just say well oh oh my you know well Grandma had that so I guess I'm gonna have that oh no no no no somebody it's got to say I'm going to stand up and fight amen I'm not just going to give in to this devil I'm not just going to give in he looks big he looks bad but when you stand up to him amen he begins to dimitish he begins to run praise God Amen to the prophet of God said when that weakest believer that weakest Christian maybe you're here this morning and you feel like you're the weakest but when you get on your knees that big bad devil he begins to tremble amen he begins to tremble because he realizes that any moment now that person is going to tap in to the king of glory he's going to tap in or she's going to tap into that eternal power source of almighty God the word and the spirit of God is going to raise up in her and she's going to unsheath a sword amen that he has no match for amen do you believe that amen so he is defeated praise God somebody pull out that sword take that word that has been on sheath in our day and begin to chop that devil into pieces and I'm going to do something he won't stick around for a fight he will run from you he'll read from you but I will tell you something it's a hand of faith that welds the sword of almighty God don't you be afraid to stand on that word and to take that enemy and defeat him everywhere oh did Brother Andrew he quoted that quote Look What We Love Oh my he quoted it Wednesday night the word of God will defeat anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any conditions it'll defeat that devil right amen because it's a spirit of God it's not you the spirit of God that dwells in you because the Bible tells us that this is not the sword of Lindsey McGrady or Ron Peterson amen or of Russell Wallace or or whoever it's the sword of the spirit and when the spirit of God takes that word Satan is no match he is defeated by that amen so oh my we're believing the word of God so don't let the psychological warfare of the devil begin to control your thoughts or control your mind or or have that amen or scare you with these things now now listen I want to go real quickly because we're not at the end of the story let's go to the end of the story just a little bit here the the sixth chapter of the book of Nehemiah and I'm trying to hurry because I know you have a baptism today that's wonderful that's great God bless you and obeying the word of God when you obey the word of God then God will do what he promised he would do amen Nehemiah the sixth chapter and it says in the first verse says now it came to pass when sand belonged to buy and guess them and the Arabian the rest of the enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left therein they closed the volume holes amen cleared out the rubber amen and built the law said though at the time I had not set up the doors upon the gates so it was still a little opening here for the enemy to get in it says that the second verse that sambalot and gesham said unto me and said come and let us meet together in some of the villages in the plain of Ono that they but they thought to do me Mischief now so if the devil can't Bluff you into quitting he wants to talk you into compromising he wants to reason with you well everybody else is doing it it's okay everybody look you know so-so's doing it so you know it's hard let's say let's we've been we've been battling too long now and this you know let's just have a compromise because you're tired of battle and I'm tired let's just compromise that's what the devil wants to do that's the next step in the psychological warfare amen of you if you won't believe his blood he said hey let's meet together let's compromise let's talk about this thing hey man how he does it but look here's here again is uh it's nehemiah's answers in the third verse and I sent message to them saying I am doing a great work so that cannot come down why should the work cease well I'll leave it and come down to you amen you know what I ain't got time to entertain a compromise I'm not going to believe you blessed and I'm not going to entertain your compromise amen says I'm doing a great work and that's what it's about it's about the work it's not about your comfort I mean it's not about what you want to do it's about the work that God has designated you to do what he has chosen you to do if you want the power of God backing you do the work of God do what God has called you I'm not talking about you don't have to be up here behind the pulpit preaching but for every one of us God is a purpose and he's called you with something to do amen he empowers you to do the work that he's called you to do Nehemiah said I'm not Nehemiah what nowhere building him a house amen he was he was doing the work for God I'm doing a great work and I don't have time to deal with you hey man that's what we have to do amen and Nellis in the fourth verse says and they said unto me four times after the sword and I answered him after the same manner the devil's persistent if nothing else right he just keeps on coming hey just let's compromise this and and Nehemiah stood on the ground and then we find out here the the fifth verse down to the ninth verse that sambalot he again changed his tactic because he sent a messenger unto uh under the amount with an open letter that they were under the pretense I'm going to send to the king saying you know what you're here in defiance of the king and you're trying to set up a kingdom and you're going to be the king and and you're God you're getting a prophet or prophets a prophet to preach to you and so the Bible tells me that the devil is a liar that there's no truth in him and that's what he wants to do he starts a smear campaign Amen to discredit you amen that's what he's doing here amen he's here I say hey he's not going to bleed my bluff he's not going to compromise and say not now I'm going to threaten him hey if you don't stop this if you don't stop what you're doing if you don't stop that praying if you don't stop fasting if you don't stop seeking God if you don't stop going to church I mean if you don't hey just compromise well you'll have to go every Sunday you don't have to go to midweek Services compromise just a little bit hey man if you won't compromise he says well you know what I'm gonna start threatening them now amen we're going to turn you in we're going to tell people amen and he starts that and so that's what he's doing and and DMI says hey there's no truth to this this lie that is being perpetrated amen against us now here's here it is we're we're down in the 15th verse in Nehemiah 6 chapter it says so the wall was finished in the 25th day of the month of elul in 50 and two days now look at this the 16th verse and it came to mass that when our enemies sambala tobiah the Arabians the ammonites all the herd of thereof hurt them and of the Heathen that were about to solve these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceive that this work was wrought of our God and so you know what I said here wait a minute oh now they their their tactic was hey let's defeat them let's discourage them but now they saw the work being accomplished and now they're the ones that are cast down instead of them putting you know Nehemiah and the Jews to flee now they're the ones that's recognize hey this we tried to stop him and we couldn't do it amen because this work was not of uh of uh evening Light Fellowship this work was of almighty God this was a just a phase amen I remember when I come out of that Methodist church amen has come around to the truth you know it's a face he's going to he's he's just 18 years old well guess what that's been good for 40 years now amen the face has been going on for 40 years and it's not getting any less praise God and see that's what the enemy says well hey it's just a phase they're going through but when they realize hey this and that's what my parents thought when I'm coming in and saying well why did my mom look at this word here we didn't we didn't find this out in the Methodist Church we didn't they didn't teach us in this semester the church look at this oh this is he's got to mix up with some Fanatics and and it's just a phase he's going through and you know what after a few years yeah mama and daddy let me take them to the baptistry down in the river and baptize them because they realized hey this ain't the work of a man amen this is the work of of the Lord hallelujah and I want you to know God's not finished yet praise God what he did for me he'll do for you what he did in my family he can do for your family don't you think ain't no two guns are too fine God will Amaze you at what he can do you hold steady you keep working the work amen you keep doing the work of God you keep standing on the word of almighty God and God will show you that child that is what I've done strength one day they're going to have a they're gonna have an eye-opening experience hey that ain't that ain't the work of man that's the work of almighty God Amen and God's gonna do the work Hallelujah now come to it you've got to stand on the word you've got to believe the word amen if the devil gets you to compromise if then what what the devil does when you start compromising the devil begins over there and starts whispering see I told you this hypocritical I told you it wasn't true I told you this just just religious that's what happens when you begin to compromise when you stand on the word of God there come a day that they're going to have to recognize this is true true this is true everything in the world is changing everything around them is changing amen all these things are going on but they stayed steady with the word of God they've not changed they uh they're more like Jesus Christ today than they've ever been amen you hold on to that word don't you compromise don't you let the devil begin to play psychological warfare with your loved ones well look at that compromised oh they say they're a Christian amen the work was done and the enemy was cast down in his own eyes and he perceived this work is of the Lord amen I'm going to bring this down until close II Corinthians it don't matter how many quotes and scriptures I've got I'm just usually good for an hour second Chris The more I've got the faster I had to preach but it still can't preach if I said brother Andrew and so II Corinthians the 10th chapter we know these verses very well it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh you cannot beat Satan at his game you cannot defeat Satan in a carnal reasoning mind that is his Battleground and that's what he wants to get you on he wants to get you to come hey come on my territory come on my ground and let's begin to reason amen let's begin to talk about this let's begin to Hash this out you can't fight him on his ground amen you've got to stand upon your upon your ground you've got to stand with the word of almighty God see brother random he said you know that that in the Garden of Eden God chose a part of man and the devil chose a part of man God chose the heart but the devil chose to intellect so he wants us to begin to fight anyway in fact that quote from Abraham's Covenant confirmed brother Graham says the devil chose zenilex and now today the church today depends on everything upon the intellect we can't we can't be there we can't go that it's not just how many quotes do you know it's not just that I will quote a quote and so forth that you know what the devil's not scared of that quote you remember over the book of Acts the 19th Chapter that there was some Vagabond Jews you remember them and they had they had witnessed Paul ministering that witness Paul casting out devils and so these seven sons of Stephen they get this Bright Idea hey we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do what Paul did we're gonna say and they go up to a man demon Spirit uh possessed by demon and says hey we endure thee by Paul by Jesus Christ who Paul preaches when that demon says hey Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you in other words that demon says I don't recognize any power or any Authority in you to take control over me it's not you we don't defeat the Devil by intellect we don't defeat the Devil amen by playing mind games amen We Stand upon the word of God by the spirit of almighty God Amen and the devil is defeated Hallelujah he's already defeated right hey man so you don't defeat him in your on your in your own ability not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith Lord hosts again it's a it's a spirit of God that takes the word of God Amen and begins to defeat the enemy praise Lord so that's why it's important not that you just know a quote amen or know a Bible verse but you've got to know the author you're going to have him living on the inside because that is the authority that Satan recognizes see I can take the word but without the uh but without the power of spirit see in the in the Bible the Bible talks about two words or in the New Testament in degree it has typically two words are used to Greek words are used for the word power that is translated into the English language one is dunamis dynamite explosive power of force amen that's what the Holy Ghost does in you but the other word is exosia which is Authority so whatever you stand out with the word of God amen with the spirit of God Amen you're standing there with the dunamis and the Ecstasy you're standing there with the power and the authority to defeat that devil and the devil recognizes that nobody wants to stand up to that devil oh Jesus I know Paul I know the prophet of God William radham I know but who are you oh no the God we serve the god that's only inside of me I may not have the same gift or the same calling as a prophet of God but I got the same God that he had and so do you right amen I'm not called to be a a church age Messenger to be a word Prophet amen I'm not that amen but I have the god amen that stood there and said thus saith the Lord amen the same God he's here today he's not a a piece of History he's not somebody that hey we're just reminisce about we tell about and what he did in the 50s and the 60s or the 40s amen but he's the same in the 21st century he's still saving he's still healing he's still delivering praise God that's the God we serve amen hallelujah amen it's that God so what does it saying for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare they are not carnal you're not fighting this Devil with a carnal ability or your mind amen But Mighty they're Mighty through God that are pulling down our strongholds our weapon our weapons are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds that strongholds the place that Satan wants to every time that I mean all of a sudden you start feeling good and you start feeling religious and you start feeling the presence of God that devil wants to go back that stronghold oh remember when you were 17 years old and you got out of church and and and and and and that's a stronghold right now but we thank God we've got a weapon Amen to those toys solve those strongholds amen that says hey if we confess us he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and he cleans us from all unrighteousness amen he don't even remember it anymore he can't be found on the books anymore amen it has been buried behind you and the devil's the only thing he do he's trying to Bluff you he's playing psychological warfare with you telling you amen oh you remember what you did you remember your marriage failed you remembered amen what you did as a young man or a young woman or this or that ah but thank God the weapons of our Warfare amen they are not carnal because if it's just carnal we'll lose but they are Mighty through God to the pulling down of the strongholds you do not have to be bound by that psychological warfare of the enemy any longer telling you you're not good enough or you made this mistake or you made too many mistakes or you know you've done this you've done that you don't have to be a prisoner to the psychological warfare anymore amen because we've got weapons and the strongholds are defeated the last verse casting down imaginations that's what we're supposed to do here comes the psychological warfare cast them down cast it down and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God amen if he's saying it if it's against the word of God you cast that down amen has no part of you and bringing into captivity every thought thought to The Obedience of Christ as the musicians come back this morning hey when you cast today it's a psychological warfare every one of us are engaged in that thing don't matter how young you are how old you are the enemy is attacking your mind the enemy is trying to give thoughts into your mind he's trying to control you through that thought process he's trying to cause you to have doubts and fears and not to believe the word of God that's psychological warfare that we're in I mean it's what's going on I read an interesting little statement one time you've probably heard this brother on somebody else has probably stood up here but if if you have it's worth repeating it said that ships do not sink because of the water around them ships sink because of the water that gets into them don't let what's happening around you get inside you and pull you down the ship it was designed to sell through the storm and you were designed by almighty God equipped by God sailed through this end time yes Satan is unleashed the internet and social media against you he's uh Unleashed all his super weapons against you but thank God the Lord didn't leave us weaponless he's unsheed the sword he's given us our super weapon amen through the revealed word of almighty God that defeats all of that amen we're more than conquers through him that loved us let's stay into our feet this morning and he may incurred up the Lawrence of your mind amen God it's not given us a spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind right to defeat this enemy we're more than conquerors maybe you're here this morning as we turn the service back over maybe you've been going through this psychological warfare maybe the enemy has been attacking you he's

psychological warfare we know that this is the biggest age of mental issues mental pressure stress and issues I mean a working man takes off his tools drops his pouches and he doesn't pick him up to the next day but the vast majority of people today work with their mind and they go home with the burdens and then they're they're on their cell phone and they're still connected and then they try to go to sleep how do you take your mind out and set it on a shelf so you can get some rest and some of you now brother Branham talks about he said some of you you are all these overthinkers you're
