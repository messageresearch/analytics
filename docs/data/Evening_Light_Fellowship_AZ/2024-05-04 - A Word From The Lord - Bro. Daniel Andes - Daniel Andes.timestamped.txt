[21:22] is a youth service although we have
[21:24] allowed I told the church that uh if the
[21:27] parents want to come or the the whole
[21:28] church wants to come I think everybody
[21:31] you know um should be here and and
[21:36] pulling uh that our young people will
[21:40] get under that atmosphere in a place
[21:44] where God can do something with them I
[21:46] mean do you know most of the disciples
[21:48] were called between 18 and 22 years of
[21:51] age think of that 18 to 22 years of age
[21:57] that's right about how many here are
[21:59] between 18 and
[22:02] 22 how about any of the you guys some of
[22:05] you 18 and 22 think of
[22:09] that God is good though amen uh we
[22:12] landed back in h Phoenix yesterday
[22:14] morning about
[22:16] 9:30 our son picked us up took us to uh
[22:20] to a little breakfast uh at Carolin they
[22:23] had a
[22:25] burrito I seem to always want to have
[22:27] Mexican food when when I come home I
[22:30] told him it'd be good to have a little
[22:31] burrito anyway we got home 9:30 uh our
[22:35] flight was delayed an actual 12 hours uh
[22:39] from the original flight plan so instead
[22:41] of leaving 10:00 at night in
[22:44] Johannesburg it left the next morning so
[22:47] instead of getting there and getting on
[22:48] the plane and getting a little something
[22:50] to eat and and then because the first
[22:53] flight 17 hours that's 17 hours sitting
[22:56] on an airplane for an old guy that's not
[22:58] easy and uh so you're you're still awake
[23:03] it's you know you don't feel like going
[23:05] to sleep till uh the plan starting to
[23:07] land and uh anyway last night Sandy and

[23:45] wife sister Shannon are here and we've
[23:48] directed this service towards the youth

[23:54] listening intently because I believe
[23:56] that God has got something for you when
[23:58] you have a man of God and he waits
[24:00] before the Lord and He seeks the mind of
[24:02] God that God would come and speak to you
[24:06] so this is directed towards you and so I
[24:09] pray that each one of you will be there

[29:26] different places I bring you greetings
[29:29] from the church back home brother Brad
[29:30] Burgess Church there we're in
[29:32] Jeffersonville now the Lord bless us we
[29:34] moved from Louisville to Indiana I bring
[29:37] greetings from the church there I just
[29:38] want to say what an honor it is to be
[29:40] with you here brother Ron amen and
[29:42] sister Sandy we had a little coffee this
[29:45] afternoon and it was wonderful to be
[29:47] with friends amen we go way way back and
[29:49] I see so many of my friends here tonight
[29:52] good to see the ones from up in
[29:54] Flagstaff God bless you I know you've
[29:55] made a great sacrifice to be here and I
[29:58] start mentioning names brother Mark
[30:00] stanky he was at my wedding many many
[30:02] years ago brother Russell amen lots of
[30:04] memories and it just seems like the
[30:06] Lord's intertwined our lives together
[30:08] amen that's for a reason God puts people
[30:10] in your life for a reason amen and they
[30:12] point you one or two ways either closer
[30:14] to the Lord Jesus or away from the Lord
[30:17] Jesus and I was thinking about that
[30:19] today how that you know when you come
[30:22] together uh you know it's good to have a
[30:24] purpose a lot of people don't have a
[30:26] purpose and I think it's tonight you all
[30:28] have set aside time it's Friday night
[30:31] you I mean I don't think anybody's here
[30:33] because you didn't have anything to do
[30:35] we all have things to do and things we
[30:37] want to do but so I found in life unless
[30:39] you stay very focused there's many
[30:42] distractions so like if you were going
[30:43] to go out and cut wood and all of a
[30:45] sudden the F-16 fighter planes go over
[30:47] your neighbor Lo their dog gets loose
[30:50] and runs by or the flowers bloom and you
[30:52] get distracted you never cut the wood
[30:54] and that's the same with going to church
[30:55] you have to have a purpose and then and
[30:58] if if you don't have that purpose and
[31:00] stay focused on that purpose you'll get
[31:02] distracted so you must Define your
[31:04] purpose our purpose is to draw closer to
[31:06] the Lord Jesus Christ how many would
[31:08] raise their hand and say I've got a
[31:09] purpose in being here now if you'll hold
[31:12] that purpose there's many things to
[31:14] distract you like you know that second
[31:16] song they sang it was just like one um
[31:19] key too high and the second verse they
[31:21] didn't say that word just right
[31:23] musicians will get OCD over that stuff
[31:25] and they'll just get or somebody's
[31:26] sitting over here and and you get
[31:28] distracted by that pretty young man or
[31:30] that you know handsome young man or
[31:33] pretty girl you know and you get but you
[31:36] have to just stay focused sometimes when
[31:38] I people are preaching I'm on the edge
[31:39] of my seat because I just want to listen
[31:41] to what they say because there's so many
[31:43] distractions in this life there's so
[31:46] many how many can say Amen there are so
[31:48] many distractions of social media and
[31:50] the internet and so many things but
[31:52] tonight we just want to have a purpose I
[31:54] want to draw closer to the Lord amen
[31:56] let's just pray together
[31:58] Heavenly Father Lord we love you today

[32:03] draw closer to you father it's such a
[32:06] blessing to see so many that have been
[32:08] serving you for so many years Lord

[32:12] the same yesterday today and forever and
[32:14] if we'll surrender our hearts to you
[32:16] you'll make us pillars in the house of
[32:18] God may you strengthen us tonight Lord
[32:20] as we read your word I pray for every
[32:22] young man that's here and every young
[32:24] woman Lord as it's a a a youth service
[32:27] so to speak but father I pray that the
[32:29] Holy Spirit would come Among Us in a
[32:31] special way Lord you know the time and
[32:34] the study and the prayer that's gone
[32:36] into the few words that we will say and
[32:38] I pray God that the you would anoint the
[32:40] words father they would just not be dry
[32:42] words but the holy spirit will come
[32:44] behind the words Lord and I think of
[32:47] those that have traveled miles to come
[32:49] to this service and I pray God when they
[32:52] drive home that they'll say did not our
[32:54] hearts burn within us when the Holy
[32:56] Spirit was speaking to us in a real way
[32:58] I pray you'd bless the word of God now
[33:00] and strengthen Us in the name of Jesus
[33:02] Christ and the church said amen amen I
[33:05] want to speak a thought tonight of a
[33:08] word from the Lord a word from the Lord
[33:12] I want to read several scriptures the
[33:13] first one I want to read in Matthew
[33:16] 4:4 amen it's good to have a Bible if
[33:19] you don't have a Bible I'm going to
[33:21] encourage you this is a youth service to
[33:23] get you a Bible if you don't have one
[33:25] I'm going to volunteer brother Ron
[33:27] because in the back office he tried to
[33:28] give me one so if you don't have a Bible
[33:30] brother Ron's got one he'll give to you
[33:32] amen so you should have a Bible and you
[33:34] should have it marked up with many
[33:36] scriptures we're going to go through
[33:37] some scriptures today that are so
[33:39] powerful and you should have a Bible and
[33:41] it becomes a part of you in your life
[33:43] and you mark in there and then you go
[33:44] back and have devotions and it means
[33:46] something to you amen Matthew the 4th
[33:49] chapter verse number four we're just
[33:50] going to jump into these chapters and
[33:52] read these verses and then speak tonight
[33:55] Matthew 4:4 and he answered and said
[33:57] said it is written man shall not live by
[33:59] bread alone but by every word that
[34:02] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[34:04] that's in red that mean Jesus Christ
[34:06] spoke it right we can't live by bread
[34:08] alone but we got to live by the words of
[34:11] God Hebrews chapter
[34:14] 4 this is out of the Bible right if I
[34:16] don't read it right you let me know
[34:18] because amen we got to live by this book
[34:21] and I got news for you I didn't write
[34:22] the book somebody else wrote the book
[34:24] it's kind of like a test Jesus said the
[34:26] word that I've spoken going to you it'll
[34:28] judge you in the last day it's kind of
[34:29] like an open book test here's the book
[34:32] go ahead and judge yourself so we won't
[34:33] be condemned at the end Hebrews
[34:37] 4:12 for the word of God is quick and
[34:40] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[34:43] sword piecing even piercing even to the
[34:45] dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and
[34:48] of the joints and Marrow and it is a
[34:50] discerner of the thoughts and the
[34:52] intents of the heart neither is there
[34:55] any creature that is not manifest in his
[34:57] sight but all things are naked and open
[35:00] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[35:03] to do now our thought tonight is a word
[35:06] from the Lord and the Bible says if you
[35:08] do receive a word from the Lord in verse
[35:10] 12 it is quick and it is
[35:13] powerful so many times people come to
[35:15] church and they don't expect anything
[35:17] and they leave and they don't get
[35:18] anything you have to expect something
[35:21] that's my thought tonight is I want a
[35:23] word from the Lord how many would say
[35:24] that I would like to have a word from
[35:26] the Lord spoken to me now this is the
[35:29] Bible and I'm not going to sit here and
[35:31] read you every part of the Bible but
[35:33] there's some part of in here tonight
[35:34] that I believe God will speak to us and
[35:37] everyone need God to speak to us in our
[35:39] lives amen we need the Lord
[35:42] Jesus 2 Timothy chapter
[35:48] 3 2 Timothy chapter 3:1 16 all scripture
[35:54] now we know that the scripture is the
[35:56] word of God so all of the word of God is
[35:59] given by inspiration of God and is
[36:02] profitable for Doctrine for Repro for
[36:04] correction for instruction in
[36:06] righteousness that the man of God may be
[36:09] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[36:11] good works amen may God add his Blessing
[36:14] to the word you may be
[36:16] seated I want to speak tonight about a
[36:19] word from the
[36:21] Lord you know it's something to just
[36:23] hear words but it's something else when
[36:26] God begins to speak to you
[36:28] you and when God begins to speak to you
[36:32] it takes men that are lost and are
[36:34] trying to find their way but when God
[36:35] speaks to them they know who they are
[36:39] Moses was told his whole life that he
[36:40] was the
[36:41] deliverer you might have been SE here
[36:43] and somebody told you your whole life
[36:45] that the message is true and Moses
[36:47] thought in his mind about what his
[36:49] mother had told him you're the deliverer
[36:51] and he lived his life and some things
[36:54] happened in his life he did some things
[36:57] that are wrong is this okay he did some
[36:59] things that he thought was right but it
[37:01] didn't go well maybe he had a problem in
[37:02] the church or his family and he just
[37:05] walked away from it all he said I'm kind
[37:06] of done with all of this and he fled to
[37:09] a way somewhere he got married started
[37:12] another career had some children but God
[37:15] knew where he was and God came looking
[37:18] for
[37:19] him and there's something about children
[37:21] of God God knows where you are and he
[37:24] knows how to find you yes sir and when
[37:27] he received a word from the Lord
[37:29] something Supernatural started happening
[37:31] and he he was a scientist brother Ram
[37:33] tells us that he could teach the
[37:35] musician you the the the the the elders
[37:38] in in Israel in in Egypt but he saw a
[37:41] bush that was burning but he noticed
[37:42] that the leaves did not it didn't
[37:44] consume and he said I think I'll turn
[37:47] aside and see this thing that's speaking
[37:49] to me and in the supernal god began to
[37:52] speak to him out of the Bush and he
[37:55] spoke back to it in fact brother br says
[37:57] in the message why Christ speak
[38:00] no man no woman no church will ever have
[38:04] a foundation stand until they speak to
[38:07] that light and it speaks back to them
[38:11] and God has a way of speaking God has a
[38:14] voice do you believe that today now God
[38:17] is a
[38:18] spirit we have five senses C taste F
[38:21] smell and here in the Pentecostal Realms
[38:24] they sought God to speak to them and
[38:26] they would feel it or they would here
[38:28] and brother Ram tells us he said those
[38:30] five senses weren't given to you to
[38:32] contact God they were given you to
[38:34] contact your Earthly realm but there's
[38:36] another sense called faith that reaches
[38:40] to God and he that cometh to God must
[38:43] believe you must believe there is a God
[38:45] Amen so he that cometh to God must
[38:48] believe how many believe there's a
[38:50] God now that's why the atheists there's
[38:53] been many people believe that that deny
[38:56] God there's been very few that have di
[38:57] died atheist because God has a way to
[38:59] call a man to judgment before he
[39:02] dies so I was going out of this
[39:05] restaurant the other day and I he there
[39:07] was a man there he said you've been to
[39:10] church and or you preached at church and
[39:12] I it kind of caught me off guard I said
[39:14] yes are you and then I said are you a
[39:15] Christian he turned and walked out the
[39:17] door he said no I'm an atheist and of
[39:19] course I had to follow him out the door
[39:21] his wife's like no I'm like no no hey
[39:23] wait wait there's been a lot of people
[39:25] live at atheist but not very many die as
[39:28] an atheist when you're breathing that
[39:29] last breath and you realize you have to
[39:31] go somewhere and you have to meet God
[39:33] and it's the grace of God that God would
[39:35] speak to
[39:36] someone there's many people amen I'll
[39:40] just say this the angels that were in
[39:43] heaven for millions of years their whole
[39:45] job was to cry holy holy holy holy holy
[39:49] and we know the story they send brother
[39:51] Ron against God Lucifer and he and he
[39:54] was cast out and the Angels were cast
[39:56] out with him there isn't one scripture
[39:59] in the Bible that says that God ever
[40:01] reached down and tried to reconcile
[40:03] those angels back to him listen to me
[40:07] but when his son Adam made a mistake
[40:10] then God came looking for his son and
[40:12] God began to call his name Adam Adam
[40:16] where are you oh if we could ever hear
[40:18] the voice of God call our Nam so many
[40:21] people go to church and they get caught
[40:23] in this what I call herd mentality or
[40:26] herd therapy and we we don't need that
[40:29] we need God that will speak to us amen
[40:32] that's what Moses did he he separated
[40:35] and he said I'll turn aside and we need
[40:37] to turn aside from the routine of life
[40:39] to let a supernatural God speak to
[40:42] us I was thinking of Jacob he had
[40:45] everything but then Esau had all caught
[40:48] up with him and there's a time you know
[40:49] you might sin and do this but the Bible
[40:52] says the soul that sinth will surely die
[40:54] there's another verse that says be sure
[40:56] your sins will find you out we have an
[40:59] ex-president is caught in a lot of legal
[41:02] suit suits because the Bible is true and
[41:04] it said be sure your sins will find you
[41:06] out someday it will catch up with you
[41:09] you might cover it in this life but
[41:10] there's a great judgment that'll catch
[41:12] up with this and judgment begins at the
[41:14] house of God and it's the mercy of God
[41:17] that God would ever speak to us I when
[41:20] God speak to us I just want to say Lord
[41:22] here am I I'm right here Lord I was
[41:26] thinking about this how that the
[41:27] scripture says the word of God a word
[41:29] from the Lord is quick and powerful and
[41:31] I just because sometimes it's just one
[41:33] word I was thinking there in Matthew the
[41:36] thir
[41:37] chapter how that the word came to to
[41:39] John the Baptist and it was just the
[41:41] word repent and he just went and started
[41:44] preaching repentance and preached
[41:46] repentance and people didn't like the
[41:47] word of the Lord Brother Ronnie they
[41:49] went out there to hear the message of
[41:51] the hour and here's a man in camel skins
[41:53] and man he had a beard honey dripping
[41:55] off his beard Maybe at w Locust and
[41:59] honey and Locust maybe one of the Locust
[42:01] wings were hanging in the honey and it's
[42:03] like ah ah and he's just screaming
[42:06] repent repent and then the religious
[42:08] people come out he said no you need to
[42:10] go bring forth fruits meat for
[42:12] repentance you stand in the mud so
[42:15] sometimes when God speak to you it's not
[42:17] the way you want it and here's what
[42:19] happens is people throw the message out
[42:22] with the messenger because the messenger
[42:24] looks a certain way but I'm here to tell
[42:27] you the truth is the truth no matter who
[42:30] speaks
[42:31] it the truth is the truth no matter who
[42:34] speaks it you may not like me you say
[42:37] brother Daniel your nose is crooked if
[42:39] you know me I've showed the scar that I
[42:41] got on my arm when I made a mistake back
[42:42] in my life so I have a lot of but if God
[42:45] uses me to speak to you don't worry
[42:47] about the messenger just listen to the
[42:49] message and they failed in John's day
[42:52] because they refused the message because
[42:54] of the messenger but the word of God
[42:55] came as one word repent
[42:58] I thought about Legion we know the story
[43:00] Jesus has just fed 5,000 they get in the
[43:02] boats they cross over and they come to
[43:04] gadera and there was a maniac that was
[43:07] there and brother Ram tells the story uh
[43:10] you can listen to the story how he tells
[43:12] the story said it was a man had a nice
[43:14] family wife and then he said he got to
[43:15] hanging around with the wrong people and
[43:17] was out with somebody and he he took a
[43:21] drink and he said he picked up his first
[43:23] devil said he went home and his wife
[43:25] said where you been d d said well I was
[43:28] just out he told a lie he said he picked
[43:30] up his second devil and after a while he
[43:33] picked up he was called Legion which
[43:35] means a thousand pretty soon he had a
[43:36] thousand demons that were encapsulated
[43:39] in this man and the Bible tells us that
[43:42] because of those demons that he took on
[43:44] in his life the Bible says he became
[43:48] homeless we're dealing with cities that
[43:50] are full of homeless people God doesn't
[43:53] want you to be like that David said I
[43:55] was once young now I'm old I've never
[43:57] seen the righteous forsaken I've never
[43:59] seen the the his seed begging for bread
[44:01] because God will take care of you
[44:04] there's something about being a child of
[44:05] God that God will take care of you some
[44:07] of you young sisters you're looking for
[44:09] security in your life sometimes we look
[44:11] and we look over here at men and people
[44:14] get married and maybe some things happen
[44:17] and they they don't have their security
[44:19] in Christ we need to have our security
[44:21] in Jesus
[44:22] Christ amen and so this man became
[44:25] homeless the Bible says he cut him
[44:27] himself and then there was chains and so
[44:29] we see in that day it was very primitive
[44:31] as we would say but now we see in our
[44:33] day that people they have chains and you
[44:35] know brother R talks about in Africa how
[44:37] that the heathens they stick bones in
[44:39] their nose and their ears and we call
[44:41] them heathens but the science has
[44:43] allowed the Heathen to refine the bones
[44:46] to to metal that is very nice metal that
[44:48] you can put in your nose or earrings or
[44:50] piercing in your bodies and we see from
[44:53] the Bibles that's the nice thing about
[44:55] life you as young people you realize you
[44:58] know we're not the first people to to go
[44:59] through life so we look around at people
[45:02] around us and there's something you can
[45:03] learn a great wisdom there's one thing
[45:05] better than learning from your mistakes
[45:07] is just learn from somebody else's
[45:09] mistakes and when they go down a path
[45:11] that's not right and things happen like
[45:12] look I'm just not going down that path
[45:14] it's kind of like people they get in
[45:17] their mind and they start walking away
[45:18] from the message of William brandom and
[45:20] I'll just tell you this I've never seen
[45:21] one person that's walked away from this
[45:23] message that has gone any place that I
[45:26] want to go
[45:27] that I want my friends to go or I want
[45:29] any of you all to go and I say look I
[45:32] don't need to go there because I see
[45:33] what it doesn't produce people that love
[45:35] Jesus Christ and want to go to church
[45:36] and be full of the Holy Spirit and
[45:38] praying and worshiping God and amen and
[45:40] live a consecrated life but you know in
[45:43] moses' day there was people that
[45:44] withstood Moses in that day and you know
[45:46] what happened the Earth opened up and
[45:48] swallowed them up the Earth is a type of
[45:51] worldliness and you watch people that
[45:53] they criticize the prophet of the day
[45:55] and watch the world open up and just
[45:57] swallow them up in all kinds of things
[45:59] of the can you say Amen of that world
[46:01] and the things of the world I'm going to
[46:03] learn from those people's mistakes I say
[46:05] I'm not going to go there and this man
[46:07] he was naked and he ran to Jesus and he
[46:09] fell down and he the Bible says he cried
[46:12] and he fell down and he worshiped but I
[46:15] want you to remember he wasn't delivered
[46:17] so coming to church and worshiping and
[46:19] crying that's all good I believe in all
[46:21] of that but it takes something more than
[46:23] that it needs it took God to speak to
[46:26] that man
[46:27] and he got a word from the Lord and that
[46:30] word from the Lord was two letters
[46:33] go go and by the power of the word of
[46:37] the Lord applied to his situation a
[46:39] thousand demons left that man can you
[46:42] say Amen to that we know the story and
[46:44] the Bible says later they came back and
[46:46] the man was said he was seated he was
[46:48] clothed and he was in his right mind so
[46:50] when you see the people of world and
[46:51] they're piercing their body they're
[46:53] cutting themselves and they've gone dark
[46:55] and the gothic and the whole thing it's
[46:57] demon powers we see it in the Bible how
[46:59] many can see it in the Bible and we
[47:01] learn from that and we see when Jesus
[47:03] tells those demons to go they're seated
[47:05] they're clothed they're not dressed
[47:07] immorally they're clothed and they're in
[47:09] their right mind I want to be close to
[47:12] Jesus amen I want to have a word from
[47:14] the Lord for me in my life I thought
[47:16] about Eve in Genesis if you have your
[47:18] Bibles Genesis chapter
[47:21] 3 verse number
[47:24] one the Bible says the serpent was was
[47:27] more subtle than any beast of the field
[47:29] he was smart he could talk he was
[47:31] upright of any beast of the field which
[47:34] the Lord God had made and he said unto
[47:35] the woman yay hath God said ye shall not
[47:38] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[47:40] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[47:42] of the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[47:44] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[47:46] the midst of the garden God has said You
[47:48] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[47:50] touch it lest she die and the serpent
[47:52] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[47:55] die don't you see how the devil is
[47:57] always coming against the word of the
[47:59] Lord that has been given God gives a
[48:01] word and the Devil Comes against that
[48:03] word of the
[48:04] Lord verse number five for God doth know
[48:07] that in the day that you eat thereof
[48:09] then shall your eyes be open and you
[48:11] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[48:14] and Satan has come down to destroy the
[48:16] word of the Lord that has been given to
[48:18] us we read the scripture Matthew chapter
[48:21] 4:4 man shall not live by bread alone
[48:23] but by every word that proceeds out of
[48:25] the mouth of God
[48:28] they had an accident in Louisville here
[48:29] a few days ago there was a person
[48:32] driving a semi on the Second Street
[48:35] bridge and a car stopped in front of
[48:37] them and they swerved to avoid the
[48:39] accident you might have seen it in some
[48:40] of the online news and the the semi went
[48:45] off the edge of the bridge the Ohio
[48:47] river flows under it and it went off the
[48:49] bridge and the trailer lodged on the the
[48:52] structure of the the bridge and the cab
[48:55] is just hanging off the side of it in
[48:57] the news they had helicopters and drones
[48:59] out and they're showing it with the live
[49:01] footage and they they come and they were
[49:04] uh Dr brought a um extension ladder from
[49:07] a a fire truck extended and had a man on
[49:10] it and he brought it down such a
[49:12] powerful I'm sitting there looking and
[49:13] getting a thousand
[49:15] sermons you know brother R said your
[49:17] soul hangs over Hell by every word of
[49:20] God said the word of God is a chain it's
[49:23] a chain and little links if you know
[49:25] anything about chains or you have a
[49:27] chain but the chain is only its
[49:29] strongest at its weakest link and your
[49:32] soul is hanging over Hell by every word
[49:35] of God and Satan came and broke in Eve's
[49:38] mind broke the word of God and that's
[49:40] where she fell and that's why we have
[49:42] the sin that's why we have the
[49:43] perversion that we have today because
[49:45] someone had a word from the Lord and
[49:47] they broke the word of the Lord and this
[49:50] person is hanging off it's an amazing
[49:52] thing I took the got some pictures of it
[49:54] and I don't have them here tonight but
[49:57] it was amazing this truck is hanging off
[49:59] and the cab is just hang dangling there
[50:02] and it's hanging way down and so they
[50:04] bring this and they have a man in a
[50:05] harness and he comes down so powerful
[50:07] brother Ron watching this man in the
[50:08] harness and it was so and so the the the
[50:11] cab is hanging off and this man is
[50:13] coming down on a harness and he's
[50:15] reaching out reaching through and saying
[50:17] put this harness on and the thing I
[50:18] observed about this he never allowed
[50:21] himself to be attached to a danger that
[50:23] would destroy him
[50:26] he would never allow himself to get
[50:29] entangled with that truck that could
[50:31] fall at any minute amen good to see you
[50:33] brother Johnson amen that and that's the
[50:37] same with you there's one thing to help
[50:38] people along the way but don't let your
[50:40] life get entangled with those people
[50:42] that when they fall they grab a hold of
[50:43] you and they pull you down and this man
[50:46] was saying you look you put this harness
[50:48] on you separate from sin that's why
[50:51] Bible says come out from among them and
[50:53] be ye separate sayeth the Lord and this
[50:55] man says put on this harness and climb
[50:57] out of there and then he attaches
[50:59] himself to this person and then pulls I
[51:01] say person it was a female driver okay
[51:04] and so they hooked it on it and then
[51:06] they begin to pull them and the whole
[51:07] world's watching and they they pull them
[51:10] uh pull them up and I learned from that
[51:12] don't get your life entangled with other
[51:15] people amen that are going to drag you
[51:17] down and the word from the Lord tonight
[51:19] may be that you need to separate from
[51:21] that person I don't believe in vague
[51:23] words from the Lord I believe God is
[51:25] very specific F and he wants to speak to
[51:28] every one of us the Bible says draw nigh
[51:30] unto God He will draw nigh unto you
[51:34] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[51:37] Hallelujah my wife and I were studying
[51:39] this morning the verse right above that
[51:40] says submit yourself to God so brother
[51:44] Ron walked out here and said look you
[51:46] know I think we're just getting a little
[51:48] bit uh complacent I'd like everybody
[51:50] over here to move over here and
[51:51] everybody to move over there like I
[51:53] don't want to do that that's just like I
[51:54] don't but if you just submit yourself to
[51:57] that say you know maybe he's right maybe
[51:58] I have just got like girls on this side
[52:01] and guys on this side and it would break
[52:03] something of and he's and that's the
[52:05] thing with the Lord sometimes he submit
[52:07] he speaks to us if you just submit to
[52:09] the spirit of God and you yield to the
[52:11] Holy Spirit whatever he's speaking to
[52:13] you he'll never leave you
[52:15] wrong he will never leave you lead you
[52:18] away from the word of God can you say
[52:20] Amen to that amen he will always lead
[52:22] you to the word of God it's the devil
[52:25] that would ever try to take you you away
[52:26] from the word of God Amen I thought
[52:30] about that story how powerful it is and
[52:32] how that I was thinking of another story
[52:35] my friend tells talking about a word
[52:37] from the Lord and my friend had got in a
[52:39] dark place in his life I think he was
[52:42] came from a separated home and he was on
[52:45] a train in Europe he was going just
[52:47] riding on this train he was just sitting
[52:49] on the train and he just come to the
[52:50] place like my life is not worth living
[52:52] He said I'm dying and so he gets up he
[52:56] goes to the the back of the train
[52:57] brother Jonathan he walks down the steps
[52:59] they have steps and he walked down the
[53:01] steps and open the door and he's
[53:02] standing there it's night time the train
[53:04] is just going and everything and he's
[53:06] just standing there he's ready to step
[53:07] off and directly there was a voice
[53:10] behind him a man said aella aella what
[53:14] are you doing he said he turned around
[53:16] and looked at this man he' never met
[53:18] this man in his life the man didn't know
[53:19] him and God had put that man in his life
[53:22] to come down and call his life back from
[53:25] a life that was about to go to ruin
[53:27] Glory that was a word from the Lord
[53:31] today I text that man and said hey I'm
[53:33] going to use your testimony tonight to
[53:34] speak to some young people that may be
[53:37] sitting at a place that you've come to
[53:38] your last service maybe this is a
[53:40] service you say I'm done this is the
[53:42] last one and then I'm done with this
[53:43] whole thing I was at a service once and
[53:45] a girl come up at the end and she said
[53:47] this was my last service I've come to a
[53:49] place in my life I'm just done with it
[53:52] all and we prayed with her and God
[53:54] changed her life maybe you're that
[53:57] person about to step off and God will
[53:59] send a man into your life that will
[54:02] change your situation if you'll listen
[54:04] to the voice of God I got some notes
[54:08] here and I don't know how to go through
[54:09] them but as the
[54:15] Lord because God has a way to
[54:18] speak brother R said this talking about
[54:22] Christ he might appear to you in the
[54:23] form of your neighbor he might appear
[54:26] appear to you in the form of a minister
[54:28] or your mother Christ appears to you in
[54:33] people he said and as you go along and
[54:36] people appear to you a kind person
[54:38] begins to speak to you listen to
[54:42] them he said you don't know it might be
[54:44] Jesus speaking to you see he appears
[54:47] I'll be with you even in you and as you
[54:49] do unto these you do unto
[54:52] me oh and when you get to looking at it
[54:54] that way the old tradition Falls away
[54:56] see it doesn't become a form of words
[54:59] and Declaration of so many words put
[55:01] together it becomes a living reality
[55:04] that Christ is in us now and the Holy
[55:06] Spirit is moving back and forth through
[55:09] every human being surging through the
[55:11] hearts
[55:16] searching if we would come to church and
[55:18] say I need God to speak to me I need God
[55:22] to speak to me God bless you brother Yi
[55:27] oh how it would change our life we're
[55:29] young people we're sitting here
[55:31] sometimes we come the place of a career
[55:33] I sitting thinking about one of the
[55:35] deacons in our church many years ago we
[55:37] maybe 15 20 years ago we sat in our
[55:39] living room my wife and I was say like I
[55:40] don't know if I should go this direction
[55:42] or I don't know and he made a choice and
[55:45] when you're at those Crossroads I'll say
[55:47] this never make a decision in your life
[55:50] a major decision out of the presence of
[55:53] God I'll say that again never make a
[55:56] major decision in your life outside of
[55:58] the presence of
[56:00] God Amen I'm delivering my heart to you
[56:03] which I believe the Lord has put on my
[56:05] heart through many hours of prayer and
[56:08] seeking the Lord of what I would say to
[56:09] you with just a limited amount of time
[56:11] in a few minutes the musicians will come
[56:13] and they'll play and I'll deliver my
[56:15] message and then you'll be given a
[56:18] package it's like a UPS man he delivers
[56:20] a package to you and he gives it to you
[56:22] now he's given it to you now what are
[56:23] you going to do with it are you going to
[56:25] open that up and are you going to look
[56:27] at it are you going to observe the
[56:29] package the delivery that's and so
[56:32] sometimes we sit and at the end of the
[56:33] service we just kind of wish it would be
[56:34] over but when God delivers a message to
[56:37] you then it's time to just maybe sit
[56:39] down or kneel down and say Lord what am
[56:41] I going to do with this
[56:43] message maybe right now God is speaking
[56:45] to you because God is a spirit he has a
[56:48] voice you don't tell him when to speak
[56:50] he speaks when he wants to speak and
[56:52] he's delivering a message to you right
[56:55] now as you're it's amazing to see young
[56:57] men with the tent of Minds that comes
[56:59] from Christ we see the world the devil
[57:02] wants to take you and hook you on meth
[57:04] or some vaping or you young ladies get
[57:07] you out of your mind and tattoo yourself
[57:08] and Pierce yourself you know you look at
[57:11] the sports guys they tattoo themselves
[57:13] because they want to identify with
[57:15] something bigger than them so a lot of
[57:17] times people are insecure and so they
[57:19] got to go get an identity and like I'm
[57:21] identified with this group or or
[57:23] something some men are so insecure they
[57:25] tattoo mama
[57:26] on their their mama like okay but now
[57:31] the people got all but we as Christians
[57:33] we come into the presence of the Lord
[57:35] like Moses Moses didn't know who he was
[57:38] he didn't know who he was he didn't know
[57:39] who God was but when he walked out of
[57:41] the presence of God he knew who he was
[57:45] he knew who God was and he knew what God
[57:47] wanted him to
[57:49] do oh if we would just wait in the
[57:51] presence of God the other week brother
[57:54] Ron and sister Sandy my wife and are
[57:56] just drinking some coffee and brother
[57:58] Ron was telling experience he just got
[58:00] up in the night he sister Sandy wasn't
[58:03] there is it all right to share this
[58:04] brother Ron it's it's the truth just I
[58:07] love brother Ron sister Sandy I want to
[58:09] share some things on Sunday the powerful
[58:11] impact their life has had on mine and
[58:14] brother Ron said he thought he heard the
[58:15] radio he went in the other room and
[58:16] sister Sandy was there and she was
[58:18] singing in the spirit singing in another
[58:20] language and singing and it was just a
[58:22] beautiful thing he said I was actually a
[58:23] little bit jealous brother Ron
[58:26] the other day we were up at my brother
[58:27] John's and the service was over and
[58:29] people just sitting and worshiping the
[58:31] music playing brother Russell many times
[58:33] we just wait in the presence of God
[58:35] because God speaks Holy Spirit moved on
[58:37] my wife and she was just sitting there
[58:39] singing in another language I don't know
[58:40] what it was but it was the presence of
[58:43] God he's in this
[58:46] room I was I don't know how to preach
[58:49] I've got some notes here but brother
[58:51] random said this he said in this
[58:53] building tonight SS Jesus Christ and
[58:56] this building tonight is host of angels
[58:59] thousands of them gathered
[59:01] around can you imagine me as a minister
[59:04] and these angels are all gathered around
[59:06] if they could speak they'd say Daniel
[59:08] tell them it's real tell them there's
[59:10] another dimension you all can't see it
[59:12] now but there is another dimension
[59:14] that's more real than this dimension in
[59:17] just a few years those that have
[59:18] accepted Christ and been filled with the
[59:20] Holy Spirit are going to be changed
[59:21] they're going to be caught into this
[59:22] Dimension that they can see those angels
[59:24] remember Elisha and Hai like we we don't
[59:27] know they're coming to fight us and he
[59:29] just said Lord open his eyes that he can
[59:31] see this other dimension Oh by faith I
[59:33] can see this Dimension amen Faith cometh
[59:36] by hearing so the Bible says the angels
[59:38] are encamped around about those that
[59:40] fear them brother Ram said you can't see
[59:42] them but you can feel the influence of
[59:46] them do you feel the influence of the
[59:48] angels of God we're not screaming we're
[59:50] not running the aisles but I know that
[59:53] the angels are in this room I know that
[59:55] God God is speaking to Hearts right now
[59:58] it's not even my voice hitting the Anvil
[1:00:01] and Stirrup of your ear but it's the
[1:00:03] spirit of God moving out as he cried to
[1:00:06] Adam Adam where are you where are you
[1:00:09] tonight and he got Adam's
[1:00:12] attention he said you can feel them
[1:00:15] telling you that they are here he said
[1:00:17] the Bible says that the angels of God
[1:00:18] are in Camp they don't leave they stay
[1:00:21] near those that fear Him brother R said
[1:00:24] wouldn't you like to live where you're
[1:00:26] conscious of that Unseen World Is Right
[1:00:29] with you all the time oh I'd like to
[1:00:31] live there I tell you it'll keep you
[1:00:32] from sin and keep you from evil in
[1:00:34] another place brother Ram said those
[1:00:36] angels are with you and they know your
[1:00:37] thoughts if you were conscious of that
[1:00:40] and you knew that they knew your
[1:00:41] thoughts you I wonder how many times
[1:00:43] they cover their eyes in in shame
[1:00:45] because your thoughts are being played
[1:00:47] to these angels that are with you but if
[1:00:49] you know that those angels are encamped
[1:00:51] around you and Christ is with you it
[1:00:52] makes you walk different makes you talk
[1:00:55] different it makes you live different
[1:00:57] not mama and daddy going with us we're
[1:00:59] growing up and you know parenting you
[1:01:01] know from the time you're born and
[1:01:03] you're part of your mother and you start
[1:01:05] separating uh apart from that you
[1:01:08] certainly wouldn't want to be 40 and
[1:01:09] have your mom still driving you to
[1:01:11] Walmart right or the whatever the the
[1:01:14] the sports store right you want to you
[1:01:16] know and so there it parenting is all
[1:01:19] letting you become independent at the
[1:01:21] right time you know at at 10 years old
[1:01:25] you would be reluctant to give a a young
[1:01:27] man an automatic pistol and say hey just
[1:01:30] go down there and you know do some
[1:01:32] target practice in downtown you know no
[1:01:35] you needed a parent that guides you and
[1:01:37] leads you and and that's what the holy
[1:01:38] spirit is there to parent us that's what
[1:01:40] the Holy Spirit he's a tutor and each
[1:01:43] one of you need a tutor through life and
[1:01:45] we have our parents I you know if you
[1:01:46] have good parents you're blessed it's a
[1:01:49] Heritage from God some people don't have
[1:01:51] good Godly Parents and God just Picks
[1:01:53] Them Up and plucks them out and it's the
[1:01:55] epitome of the gra of God people that
[1:01:57] don't even have Christian parents and
[1:01:58] God just Picks Them Up says you're one
[1:02:00] of mine but I'll be a father to the
[1:02:02] fatherless you may be heing you say I
[1:02:04] never had a father that prayed with me
[1:02:05] at night but Christ said I will be a
[1:02:08] father to the
[1:02:10] fatherless so I never had anybody that
[1:02:12] loved me well Christ loves you see
[1:02:15] brother Daniel I don't know which way to
[1:02:16] turn I tell you you just wait in the
[1:02:18] presence of God and the Bible says when
[1:02:20] he the holy spirit is coming he will
[1:02:22] lead you and he will guide you it
[1:02:25] doesn't happen in the fast lane of life
[1:02:27] it doesn't happen on the fast lane of
[1:02:28] the internet but it comes in the
[1:02:30] quietness of the Holy Spirit when you're
[1:02:32] waiting there and say Lord which way
[1:02:34] should I go Lord I need to hear your
[1:02:36] voice are you with me tonight is anybody
[1:02:39] there with me and say Lord I need you to
[1:02:41] speak to me sometimes we say oh young
[1:02:44] people yeah they're seeking the Lord for
[1:02:45] the direction of their life but I can
[1:02:47] tell you it doesn't matter how old you
[1:02:48] get you're still praying the same prayer
[1:02:51] Lord will you lead me will you guide me
[1:02:54] will you show me which way to turn I
[1:02:56] don't know if you're young brother
[1:02:58] Justin and his wife there just got

[1:03:58] alone to pray I just thoughts come to
[1:04:01] mind I remember I might have shared this
[1:04:02] I don't remember one day my father came
[1:04:04] in my office I worked at the voice of
[1:04:06] God for Brother Joseph brandham we
[1:04:08] trying to get the message out to the
[1:04:09] world my father came in my office said
[1:04:11] Daniel said there's been a terrible
[1:04:14] accident and your son's been in a car
[1:04:16] accident and he has a head injury they
[1:04:18] don't know how bad it is and you
[1:04:21] probably should go to the hospital I
[1:04:23] said which hospital is and he said we we
[1:04:25] don't know we we we don't know where
[1:04:26] he's at we just know he's going to the
[1:04:27] hospital is this okay you give you a few
[1:04:29] minutes to so I said okay I'll find my
[1:04:32] son but I need a few time Minutes Alone
[1:04:34] with God because God knows everything
[1:04:38] there's no SOS to God there's no
[1:04:40] emergency he knew before the foundation
[1:04:42] of the world everything that you would
[1:04:43] go through and I went in the bathroom
[1:04:46] this little bitty bathroom at the voice
[1:04:47] of God and I went there and said Lord I
[1:04:50] don't know what we're about to go
[1:04:52] through I don't know what this is all
[1:04:54] about but you promis you would never
[1:04:56] leave me and you would never forsake me
[1:04:58] Lord you go with me you help my son
[1:05:00] wherever he is then I went to one
[1:05:02] hospital I just walked pull up the
[1:05:04] emergency walk through the emergency I
[1:05:06] know you're not supposed to do that went
[1:05:07] in all the rooms like where's my they
[1:05:09] said he's not here I went to another
[1:05:10] hospital walked all through the rooms I
[1:05:12] said where's my son they said well
[1:05:14] they're flying him in with the
[1:05:15] helicopter I said all right where's the
[1:05:16] helipad they poin me on the helipad I
[1:05:18] said they're going to fly him in I said

[1:05:21] there and directly somebody came through
[1:05:23] and it wasn't my son it was somebody
[1:05:24] else's son and he came through I'm like
[1:05:26] what happened he said well he's in a car
[1:05:27] wreck and he hadn't we prayed and God
[1:05:29] delivered that boy but just the point of
[1:05:31] you never know when something's going to
[1:05:33] happen amen I was thinking brother
[1:05:35] Zachary is he here brother C here but
[1:05:38] brother Zachary how that we were
[1:05:39] preaching to brother Ted's I tell the
[1:05:40] story brother I've told him before how
[1:05:42] we were leaving church and after the
[1:05:44] service we come up I thought it was a
[1:05:45] semi turned over in the road and we got
[1:05:47] up there it was a F-150 truck turned on
[1:05:49] the side two uh two vehicles laying on
[1:05:52] their side and I thought you know what
[1:05:55] if that was somebody somebody from
[1:05:56] church and I never asked them if they
[1:05:58] were right with the Christ you know
[1:06:01] that's the thing as as ministers it
[1:06:03] comes with a
[1:06:05] burden it's not this me too movement
[1:06:08] like Oh I'm a preacher too I got an iPad
[1:06:11] I got a Bible I can talk pretty good I'm
[1:06:12] a preacher I like no it comes the burden
[1:06:15] of the word comes to an individual and
[1:06:18] they have a burden in their heart I have
[1:06:20] a burden for every one of you my first
[1:06:22] burden is not how good you are at soccer
[1:06:25] or what your IQ is or what your GPA you
[1:06:29] know but my my my my burden is are you
[1:06:32] ready to meet the Lord if we would go
[1:06:33] and an hour from now we meet you at the
[1:06:35] intersection you're hanging in your seat
[1:06:37] belt in that instant one man it was a
[1:06:39] drunk driver hit man was hanging in his
[1:06:41] suit in the seat Bel dead and the other
[1:06:43] person hanging there and we don't know
[1:06:44] what an hour from from now holds amen
[1:06:48] but we want to be ready to meet the Lord
[1:06:49] and my job is to challenge you are you
[1:06:51] ready to meet the Lord yes sir and what
[1:06:54] if you would go out and not be ready to
[1:06:55] meet the Lord I want to know Lord I have
[1:06:57] done my best to call people to
[1:07:00] repentance to a real experience with the
[1:07:02] Lord Jesus Christ that's what it takes a
[1:07:04] real experience with god brother Wesley
[1:07:07] it takes men amen that have been on the
[1:07:09] backside of the desert or wherever your
[1:07:11] deserted it might be in a park it might
[1:07:13] be in your car somewhere where God comes
[1:07:15] and speaks to you and you know that
[1:07:17] you're a child of God and you confess
[1:07:19] your sins to him he sends the witness of
[1:07:21] the Holy Ghost back into your life and
[1:07:23] confirms to you that your sins are
[1:07:25] forgiven for given and you know who God
[1:07:26] is he's a supernatural God and God comes
[1:07:29] to find you it's not because you were
[1:07:31] born in a good home I was thankful I was
[1:07:34] born in a good home and I'm very
[1:07:35] thankful for that but I had to get lost
[1:07:37] enough to know that I needed to be saved
[1:07:40] sometimes we go through and we dress
[1:07:42] right and we do everything and that's
[1:07:44] all good but somewhere you have to get
[1:07:45] lost and realize I need a
[1:07:48] savior I need God to save me from
[1:07:52] myself because if God doesn't save me
[1:07:55] from my myself I'll
[1:07:58] self-destruct and many times people are
[1:08:00] given talents in life and it's their
[1:08:02] talents that actually destroy
[1:08:05] them Elvis Presley had a great talent to
[1:08:09] sing and he was very handsome and the
[1:08:12] the talent that He had actually allowed
[1:08:15] him to not only be lost but take
[1:08:16] millions and millions of souls to hell
[1:08:19] is that all right if I take my coat off
[1:08:21] You Can't Fight The Devil with the coat
[1:08:23] on replace the so we see these people
[1:08:27] and we've been through it before how the
[1:08:28] these singers most of them were raised
[1:08:30] in Christian homes and their their
[1:08:32] inspiration comes from God because Jesus
[1:08:34] said I the way I'm truth and the life
[1:08:36] he's inspiration and these people they
[1:08:38] they get the inspiration of God and they
[1:08:39] have beautiful maybe even bodies and
[1:08:41] figures and voices and they go out and
[1:08:43] the devil takes them and twists them and
[1:08:45] and takes them to hell and takes
[1:08:46] millions and millions of souls to hell
[1:08:48] with them don't be that way turn away
[1:08:51] from that don't follow somebody to Hell
[1:08:53] follow somebody to Heaven amen amen Amen
[1:08:57] brother R said what an atmosphere this
[1:08:59] is an atmosphere that I wish I could
[1:09:01] live in Forever this sweet humble
[1:09:03] feeling what is it what is that how many
[1:09:06] can say I can feel that sweet humble
[1:09:09] something in this presence in the room
[1:09:11] there's not you know hatred is a spirit
[1:09:13] you've been people are cussing and
[1:09:15] they're fighting and they're fist
[1:09:16] fighting that's a spirit but now there's
[1:09:19] love and there joy and their peace and
[1:09:21] that's a presence brother Ram said what
[1:09:23] is that
[1:09:26] he said it what is it it's the Angels
[1:09:28] walking up and down the aisles all
[1:09:30] around these posts around this tent on
[1:09:32] the outside angels of God are moving
[1:09:35] their great Wings spread that's what
[1:09:37] makes you feel that way you didn't feel
[1:09:40] like this all the time you don't see
[1:09:41] nothing you're different from when you
[1:09:43] walked in here a while ago brother Adam
[1:09:46] said I feel it I'm conscious of it and I
[1:09:48] want to be conscious of it too and
[1:09:50] there's something about the presence of
[1:09:51] God if you've ever been in the presence
[1:09:53] of God you're conscious when the
[1:09:55] presence and the spirit of God comes
[1:09:57] around you how many know what I'm
[1:09:58] talking about maybe one day you were
[1:10:00] Bound by some addiction maybe it was
[1:10:01] alcohol maybe it was drugs maybe it was
[1:10:03] pornography maybe it was music maybe it
[1:10:05] was lust maybe it was Pride whatever it
[1:10:06] was and you realize there was only one
[1:10:08] thing that you could could deliver you
[1:10:10] and it was the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:13] Fire John the Baptist said I'm baptizing
[1:10:16] you with water but there's one coming
[1:10:19] after me that will baptize you with the
[1:10:21] Holy Ghost and Fire and so some people
[1:10:24] get in the rain and it just rains on him
[1:10:27] the Holy Ghost just rains on him but
[1:10:29] John said there's one coming after me
[1:10:31] Christ he's going to baptize you with a
[1:10:33] fire of the Holy Ghost that'll burn
[1:10:35] those desires out of your life they'll
[1:10:38] burn those evil desires out of your life
[1:10:41] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:10:43] there's so many scriptures that come to
[1:10:45] my mind right now talking about a word
[1:10:47] from the Lord I think about Peter how he
[1:10:50] came on the day of Pentecost he preaches
[1:10:51] the Acts chapter 2 the whole the whole
[1:10:53] thing and then he comes down
[1:10:55] um because sometimes a word from the
[1:10:57] Lord listen to me right here can be a
[1:10:59] collection of
[1:11:01] words so I was thinking of like um
[1:11:04] Isaiah in in Isaiah 38:4 it said the
[1:11:07] word of the Lord came to Isaiah in
[1:11:10] Malachi I believe it's the first chapter
[1:11:12] the first verse says the burden of the
[1:11:14] word came to Israel by
[1:11:17] Malachi so maybe you would say the
[1:11:19] burden of the word came to Phoenix by
[1:11:22] brother Daniel and God puts the burden
[1:11:25] on my heart to bring some scriptures the
[1:11:27] word of God and to bring the word of God
[1:11:29] to you and it comes through a burden so
[1:11:32] it can be a collection of so Peter the
[1:11:34] word of the Lord came to Peter and he
[1:11:36] preaches a whole chapter but the gist
[1:11:39] the message of it was you need to
[1:11:41] repent you need to be baptized in the
[1:11:44] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:11:46] of your sins and you shall be filled
[1:11:48] with the Holy Ghost brother du you shall
[1:11:51] be re refilled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:53] he said for This Promise is unto you
[1:11:55] that the Jews and your children and as
[1:11:57] to as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:11:59] call and if you're sitting here today
[1:12:01] and you have a desire for a power in you
[1:12:03] that'll give you a power over sin and
[1:12:05] the ability to live above sin if there's
[1:12:07] something calling you for that then it's
[1:12:09] for
[1:12:10] you now there's some people that don't
[1:12:12] believe in it but I believe in it
[1:12:14] because I tried to live a Christian Life
[1:12:16] without the power of the Holy Spirit and
[1:12:18] you have to have the Holy Spirit in your
[1:12:19] life to give you power Jesus tells Peter
[1:12:22] who walked on the water fed 5,000 he
[1:12:24] said you go ter in the city of Jerusalem
[1:12:26] and you'll be endued with a power from
[1:12:28] on high is everybody with me and so he
[1:12:31] brings a word from the Lord you got to
[1:12:33] repent you got to be baptized if you're
[1:12:35] here today and you've never been
[1:12:36] baptized I want you to get baptized I
[1:12:39] think it's acts there on in the books
[1:12:41] the Bible says he commanded them he's
[1:12:43] very Stern he wasn't suggesting no he
[1:12:45] that believeth in is baptized shall be
[1:12:47] saved we need to get
[1:12:48] baptized anden he said you shall receive
[1:12:51] the gift of the Holy Ghost and so there
[1:12:53] was a word of the Lord that came to him
[1:12:55] I was thinking of over in Acts the 19th
[1:12:57] Chapter this is such I've been studying
[1:12:59] this chapter 18 and chapter 19 there's a
[1:13:01] man Apollos comes by and he's he knows
[1:13:04] about Christ died and he rose again
[1:13:05] wouldn't it be a amazing thing to say
[1:13:08] this man died and he rose again he was
[1:13:09] going telling everybody look he's the
[1:13:10] Christ he's the Christ so Peter comes
[1:13:12] along he says have you received the Holy
[1:13:14] Ghost since you believed it's like we
[1:13:17] didn't know there was a holy ghost we
[1:13:19] just knew Jesus died and rose again and
[1:13:21] that's amazing he's the Christ and but
[1:13:23] Paul said no have you received the Holy
[1:13:26] Ghost since you believe we said we
[1:13:28] didn't even know there was a holy ghost
[1:13:29] we just heard Jesus rose and he ascended
[1:13:31] up on high and he so Paul comes and he
[1:13:33] tells them no no there's a holy ghost
[1:13:36] there's a power of God that will come
[1:13:39] back and F you and give you the power to
[1:13:41] live an overcoming life it's the baptism
[1:13:44] of the Holy Spirit and you need it every
[1:13:46] one of us need it sir the Bible says
[1:13:49] without the spirit of Christ you're none
[1:13:51] of his the Bible says is it Romans
[1:13:53] chapter 8 if that same spirit that
[1:13:55] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:13:57] it will Quicken your mortal body that's
[1:13:59] why you see people they come in they go
[1:14:01] for a long a while Church a few years
[1:14:03] and and then they go and then they just
[1:14:04] fade out into the world they needed
[1:14:06] something greater they needed that Holy
[1:14:08] Ghost and Fire that would give them
[1:14:09] power to live above sin I'm not talking
[1:14:12] about a theory I'm talking about
[1:14:13] something I experienced in my life can
[1:14:15] you say Amen to that and receive the
[1:14:18] power of the Holy Ghost and it comes
[1:14:19] into you amen it doesn't mean you're
[1:14:21] going to be perfect doesn't mean you're
[1:14:22] going to make a mistake but the Bible
[1:14:24] says when he the Holy Ghost has come
[1:14:26] he'll reprove you of sin and when you do
[1:14:28] wrong the holy spirit says no no no
[1:14:30] gives you a nice little spank said
[1:14:32] you're not going to live like that and
[1:14:33] you're not going to talk like that
[1:14:35] because sons of God don't live like that
[1:14:36] and talk like that God has a very plain
[1:14:40] voice I was thinking about that how that
[1:14:42] the word of the Lord comes and sometimes
[1:14:44] there's a whole message I was thinking
[1:14:46] of the message choosing of a bride I was
[1:14:48] looking it up in the room it's an hour
[1:14:49] and 41 minutes brother R preaches this
[1:14:52] message and tells about the prophecy of
[1:14:55] of California going into into the ocean
[1:14:57] and the gist of the whole message could
[1:15:00] be boiled down to Christ is coming for a
[1:15:04] bride and he will take that bride and
[1:15:06] Rapture her out then judgment will come
[1:15:08] on the earth California will go into the
[1:15:10] ocean somewhere the judgments of God we
[1:15:13] these are prophecies it's a word of the
[1:15:14] Lord that came from a prophet they might
[1:15:16] be delayed but they will come to pass I
[1:15:19] don't have time to get in to to all of
[1:15:21] those things but brother R tells us a
[1:15:23] 1500 m chunk will go into the ocean he
[1:15:26] says in another place everything on the
[1:15:28] face of the Earth will shake down those
[1:15:30] things are
[1:15:31] coming those things are coming it's been
[1:15:33] spoke by a prophet as a virgin Isaiah
[1:15:36] said a virgin shall conceive listen to
[1:15:38] me Isaiah went to the grave as a false
[1:15:40] prophet they said look no virgin ever
[1:15:42] conceived and brought forth and that
[1:15:44] didn't happen but 800 years later a
[1:15:46] virgin conceives and the word of that
[1:15:48] Prophet was a seed and it came to pass
[1:15:51] California's going to go in the ocean
[1:15:53] amen I'm here to tell you it's word of
[1:15:55] it's come by a Vindicated Prophet here's
[1:15:58] another one he had seven Visions is this
[1:16:00] okay you know what I am not a pessimist
[1:16:02] but I am a realist and I hate Scare
[1:16:05] Tactics but I do want you to tell me the
[1:16:07] truth the prophet of God comes he had
[1:16:09] seven Visions six of them have come to
[1:16:11] pass we don't have to preach on those
[1:16:12] and the the world war and the the the
[1:16:15] cars the autonomous cars we passed one
[1:16:17] yesterday my wife's like what is that I
[1:16:19] said that's that car uh brother R had
[1:16:21] the vision said he saw a car going down
[1:16:22] the road with no drivers it's one no and
[1:16:24] there the the prophecies being fulfilled
[1:16:26] he saw a woman rise in power he said to
[1:16:29] vice president he said it might be the
[1:16:31] Catholic Church we've got the vice
[1:16:32] president right there amen the these
[1:16:35] Visions are but the last one he had was
[1:16:37] America just being in ashes just
[1:16:40] ruined and we have people saying hey
[1:16:42] we're going to make America great I've
[1:16:43] said this before but I'm here to tell
[1:16:45] you the word of the Lord doesn't change
[1:16:47] the word of the Lord doesn't change amen
[1:16:49] California's going to the ocean America
[1:16:51] will be nothing but ashes and we're here
[1:16:53] today to remind our ourselves of the
[1:16:55] word of the Lord say Lord will you
[1:16:57] remind me of the word of the Lord that
[1:16:59] has been delivered and let it alter my
[1:17:01] life it altered moses' life it altered
[1:17:04] his career it will alter your life like
[1:17:07] hey I'm just going to forget church and
[1:17:08] go make a million dollars I'll be back
[1:17:10] when I'm for no no it'll alter your life
[1:17:12] say Lord let me live every day amen the
[1:17:15] Bible says it is a fearful thing to fall
[1:17:18] into the hands of an Angry
[1:17:20] God may the Lord help us to be sober I
[1:17:23] don't mean to be very Stern but I tell
[1:17:25] you the Bible says be sober we live in a
[1:17:28] world that is drunken they are going on
[1:17:31] intoxications on entertainment am me
[1:17:34] every country it used to be every
[1:17:35] country had their own little niche like
[1:17:37] was it Australia where they were
[1:17:38] engineers the Germans very exact and
[1:17:40] precise and now everybody's migrated and
[1:17:42] it's all mixed up but America has a
[1:17:44] niche on entertainment the world they
[1:17:46] cannot produce the movies and the
[1:17:47] entertainment and we become drunk on
[1:17:50] that amen the people it used to be
[1:17:52] people go look at pictures and then they
[1:17:54] started doing videos and then they
[1:17:55] started making movies and now they do
[1:17:57] YouTube shorts and people are become
[1:17:58] addicted and they and they get caught on
[1:18:00] these things we need to get away from
[1:18:02] those things and look to Jesus Christ
[1:18:04] and look to your soul that's worth a
[1:18:06] million worlds and stop playing with the
[1:18:09] world and the things of the world and
[1:18:10] let some nice person as a prophet of God
[1:18:12] said some nice person will shake you and
[1:18:15] say look she that liveth in pleasure is
[1:18:17] dead while she yet
[1:18:19] lives the world is making these zombie
[1:18:21] movies people walk around they're all
[1:18:24] kind of a the prophet of God Amen in the
[1:18:28] Bible said there's coming a time where
[1:18:29] people will be dead while they yet live
[1:18:32] now they're showing them making huge
[1:18:34] movies out but people that live in the
[1:18:36] pleasures of sin they're dead while
[1:18:37] they're yet living don't look at that
[1:18:39] get away from it get back to the
[1:18:41] realities of Jesus Christ blessed be the
[1:18:45] name of the Lord amen it's good to be a
[1:18:47] Christian isn't it Noah's day God spoke
[1:18:50] to Noah and said build an ark the word
[1:18:52] of the Lord it alter his life forever
[1:18:55] build an ark and he got into it couple
[1:18:57] things about the word of the Lord is
[1:18:58] everybody with me all right nobody's
[1:19:00] sleeping everybody's awake okay there's
[1:19:02] one thing about the word of the lord we
[1:19:03] read it that the word of the Lord is
[1:19:06] inspired it's
[1:19:08] inspired I thought about that when God
[1:19:10] said let there be light and the Bible
[1:19:12] says and there was light the Bible says
[1:19:15] the Earth was without form and it was
[1:19:17] void and the spirit of the Lord moved
[1:19:18] over the the deep and that's way a lot
[1:19:20] of people were born into this world Amen
[1:19:22] and our parents try to lead us in the
[1:19:24] right way sometimes we get away from
[1:19:25] them and we kind of things go auk and
[1:19:27] you say you know what I'm like the Earth
[1:19:29] my Earth my my life is without form and
[1:19:31] it's void of any purpose and that's why
[1:19:33] a lot of people go and they take their
[1:19:34] life because their life has no
[1:19:37] purpose and the spirit of the Lord might
[1:19:39] move over them but the Earth needed
[1:19:40] something more than the spirit of the
[1:19:42] are you with me tonight something more
[1:19:44] than the spirit of the Lord to work move
[1:19:46] over it they needed God to speak to the
[1:19:49] Earth and God spoke and said let there
[1:19:51] be light and the Bible says and there
[1:19:54] was light
[1:19:55] oh if God could speak to our life amen
[1:19:58] and let there be light in whatever
[1:19:59] situation we is because the devil will
[1:20:01] lead you to Darkness there's only two
[1:20:03] forces light and darkness God and Satan
[1:20:06] good and evil we need to get back to
[1:20:07] that the devil wants to mix it all up
[1:20:10] and blur it all down but I tell you
[1:20:12] there was something about turning your
[1:20:14] way life completely to Christ and
[1:20:16] turning your life completely away from
[1:20:18] the devil can you say Amen to that it's
[1:20:20] a word from the Lord that speaks to you
[1:20:22] gives you confidence amen I was thinking
[1:20:25] about how the word of the Lord there's
[1:20:27] something the word is so powerful it's
[1:20:29] so inspired there's something and I'm
[1:20:31] going to come back to this later but the
[1:20:32] word of the Lord is so inspired it can
[1:20:34] be used in compound
[1:20:36] ways God spoke said out of Egypt have I
[1:20:39] called my son and we know when Moses
[1:20:40] came God called him out of Egypt and
[1:20:42] deliver he was a mighty deliverer and
[1:20:43] that was a great thing that but then the
[1:20:45] word of God Is So inspired it's compound
[1:20:48] meetings that Christ when he came out of
[1:20:50] Egypt he also came out as Moses was a
[1:20:52] type how many can see that and the the
[1:20:54] compound meaning was he called Christ
[1:20:56] out who also delivered his people so we
[1:20:59] find that the word of God is has a
[1:21:02] compound meaning when when John the
[1:21:04] Baptist went forth and said
[1:21:06] repent if I can read that same word of
[1:21:09] God today because the word of God knows
[1:21:10] no time it knows no space if I can read
[1:21:13] the same word of God today the message
[1:21:15] and the inspiration is the same as John
[1:21:17] preached repent be baptized I can read
[1:21:20] the same word of God and the Holy Spirit
[1:21:22] will come to his word we read it all
[1:21:24] scriptures given by inspiration of God
[1:21:26] the holy spirit will come to you and say
[1:21:28] you need to repent you need to get
[1:21:30] baptized tonight for the remission of
[1:21:33] your sins amen I was thinking
[1:21:36] about so many things how that the Holy
[1:21:39] Spirit we need to wait on the
[1:21:42] Lord you don't rush in and tell God God
[1:21:45] speaks sovereignly sometimes you got to
[1:21:47] when you and just because all I guess
[1:21:49] all of us are seeking the Lord for our
[1:21:51] lives you never get past that and God
[1:21:53] calls if some in this room and I heard
[1:21:55] this voice said Daniel Daniel I would
[1:21:58] try to move towards that voice that
[1:22:01] person may be in that room I go I go in
[1:22:04] there Daniel then I go and then maybe
[1:22:06] they're in another room and there's
[1:22:07] another and that's the way God is he
[1:22:10] speaks your name and then he wonders if
[1:22:11] you move the Bible says draw nigh unto
[1:22:13] God and He will draw nigh unto you and
[1:22:16] all of us get in situation you might be
[1:22:18] a mother and you say I don't know how to
[1:22:19] deal with this situation with my child
[1:22:21] you might be a father and sometimes
[1:22:23] things happen and life other people make
[1:22:25] decisions and put you on a path maybe in
[1:22:27] your marriage and like Lord I'm I'm
[1:22:28] going to be a Christian wherever I am
[1:22:31] sometimes parents make decisions I make
[1:22:33] decisions I'm not going to serve the
[1:22:34] Lord but you know it used to be uh you
[1:22:37] know many years ago where we had good
[1:22:38] functioning families I taught Sunday
[1:22:40] school you tell look children obey your
[1:22:41] parents but now we live in a day where
[1:22:43] Mom and Dad sometimes get off the rails
[1:22:45] and they fall off the boat that's why
[1:22:46] the Bible says children obey your
[1:22:48] parents in the Lord but when they stop
[1:22:50] serving the lord then you stop obeying
[1:22:52] your parents when they say look you
[1:22:54] going into Walmart and steal some liquor
[1:22:55] say look I'll go into Walmart but I'm
[1:22:57] not stealing the liquor because my God
[1:22:59] says Thou shal not steal because my
[1:23:01] father is God the word of God Amen we
[1:23:03] need to be born of the word of God and
[1:23:05] when God speaks to you it gives you
[1:23:06] strength it gives you courage Paul was
[1:23:09] going in this way thinking he was doing
[1:23:11] right killing the Christians but God
[1:23:12] spoke to him he said who are you who are
[1:23:16] you you people sometimes when you
[1:23:18] experience the presence of the Lord you
[1:23:21] don't know what it is Samuel comes and
[1:23:24] God speak to him Samuel Samuel he went
[1:23:27] to somebody that was older him he went
[1:23:28] to his Pastor his he was backslid and
[1:23:31] his like no I didn't call you go lay
[1:23:32] down and the third time the backslid
[1:23:34] preacher like you know what I bet that's
[1:23:35] God speaking to them well I'll just tell
[1:23:37] them hey when that speaks again you say
[1:23:39] here am I your servant Lord I I hear and
[1:23:42] sometimes when God speaks to you you
[1:23:43] don't know what it
[1:23:47] is Sister Sandy was I'll share your
[1:23:51] testimony she was saying that she the
[1:23:53] Holy Spirit moved moved on her she was
[1:23:55] alone in a place and and and and God
[1:23:59] moved on her to speak in tongues and she
[1:24:00] didn't even know what it was I remember
[1:24:01] as a 17-year- old boy God was dealing
[1:24:03] with my
[1:24:05] heart and it just like I don't I can't
[1:24:08] explain I don't know it's something's
[1:24:09] moving inside of me and I want to
[1:24:11] surrender to Christ and he'll always
[1:24:13] he's a gentleman he'll never beat you
[1:24:15] he'll never abuse you he's a gentleman
[1:24:19] and when you move towards him he will
[1:24:20] move towards
[1:24:22] you I remember as a 17-year-old boy I
[1:24:24] was sitting on the second row about
[1:24:25] where this boy is sitting here they
[1:24:27] dismiss the service when God's dealing
[1:24:29] with you you're kind of glad when they
[1:24:31] dismiss the service cuz that leaves you
[1:24:32] alone with God and you can pray and you
[1:24:36] can draw close to God and we're here
[1:24:37] tonight that's what this church is for
[1:24:39] sir the Bible says this my house should
[1:24:41] be called a House of Prayer you want to
[1:24:42] pray till midnight somebody will be here
[1:24:45] to pray with you amen because this is
[1:24:46] where God speaks people like I've never
[1:24:48] felt the presence of God do you ever go
[1:24:50] to his house say brother Daniel's there
[1:24:52] I don't I sh you come to my house I can
[1:24:55] shake your hand you can feel my presence
[1:24:56] and and that's the same with God we need
[1:24:58] to be in his presence and not put him on
[1:25:00] all right God you got 34 minutes and
[1:25:03] ding I'm out of here but if we get on
[1:25:05] God's Time Lord what do you want to say
[1:25:06] to me Lord I'm here shape me and mold me
[1:25:09] and make it clear enough that I know
[1:25:11] it's you Lord if I got to get away from
[1:25:13] that boy you're going to have to have
[1:25:14] something greater than that
[1:25:17] boy if it's going to be greater than
[1:25:19] this girl and God's asking you to make a
[1:25:21] separation from that boyfriend or
[1:25:23] girlfriend then God you're going to have
[1:25:24] to give me something greater than that
[1:25:26] affection that I have towards that boy
[1:25:28] or girl and there is something it's
[1:25:30] Jesus Christ and it's the power of the
[1:25:33] holy spirit that can speak to you I
[1:25:36] remember I was on the second row and
[1:25:37] they dismissed I remember taking my coat
[1:25:39] off and I threw it over the altar I said
[1:25:41] Lord we're going to be here a while
[1:25:42] we've got some things to talk about I
[1:25:44] remember kneeling there and I had never
[1:25:48] experienced speaking in tongues or
[1:25:49] stabing lips but for two hours I laid on
[1:25:52] that Altar and I poured my heart out to
[1:25:54] God I said God this is all of it this is
[1:25:57] everything back into you know the
[1:25:58] churches and Ministries and this and
[1:26:01] this and I just poured my heart out to
[1:26:03] God I didn't even know what that was I I
[1:26:06] I was trying I said Lord I don't
[1:26:07] understand this but my heart I think
[1:26:09] that's what it says in Romans the 8th
[1:26:11] chapter the Bible says we know not how
[1:26:13] to pray but the spirit makes
[1:26:15] intercession with groanings that cannot
[1:26:17] be under Lord I don't understand it but
[1:26:19] Lord there's a burden in my heart
[1:26:21] something's speaking to me something's
[1:26:22] drawing close to God you know the Bible
[1:26:24] says no man can come except the father
[1:26:27] draws him and if you have a desire you
[1:26:29] wouldn't be here tonight if you didn't
[1:26:31] have a desire and God gave you that
[1:26:32] desire and God's trying to speak to
[1:26:34] every one of us and draw us closer to
[1:26:36] him and try to get us away from the
[1:26:38] noise of the world of the fashion and
[1:26:40] the internet and all these influencers I
[1:26:43] tell you what if somebody is influencing
[1:26:45] you away from the word of God they're
[1:26:46] going to take you to hell right amen
[1:26:49] don't follow the influencers to Hell God
[1:26:51] wants to make every one of you an
[1:26:53] influencer he wants want you to fill you
[1:26:54] with the power of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:56] then you'll be a witness for God people
[1:26:59] trying to go out here get a million
[1:27:00] followers doing something immoral or
[1:27:02] extreme we get it all the time people
[1:27:03] falling off the grand Kings trying to
[1:27:05] get close to the edge of the perfect
[1:27:06] picture like God doesn't want you to
[1:27:08] live close to the edge of s he wants you
[1:27:09] to live as far as you can away from
[1:27:12] sin oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:15] we don't want to be stubborn some of you
[1:27:17] sisters you're just so wonderful people
[1:27:20] like my wife I think she tells me she
[1:27:21] only got one weapon growing up
[1:27:25] dad tell her one time she just does
[1:27:27] what's right right now we boys are a
[1:27:29] different thing like it's got to be 100
[1:27:30] DCB or I don't even hear it you know I
[1:27:33] have I raised three sons I never had the
[1:27:35] little girl you you look at like stop
[1:27:37] screaming at me like I don't know how to
[1:27:40] our granddaughter come over once and I
[1:27:42] just kind of said something she just
[1:27:43] broke down and like what is that like
[1:27:46] it's different there is a difference
[1:27:49] between males and females I always kid
[1:27:51] him I said the boys they have a little
[1:27:53] button on the rear end unless you push
[1:27:54] it nothing gets to their brain you can
[1:27:57] talk in their ear and they don't get it
[1:27:59] but you push this button and then
[1:28:00] somehow like oh you don't want me to
[1:28:02] throw rocks at cars that's what it I
[1:28:05] remember one time we were standing out
[1:28:06] throwing snowballs at cars and then hit
[1:28:09] one and it was a police car and he
[1:28:10] turned around and come back so we ran
[1:28:12] the other way and we knocked on these
[1:28:13] people's house and then we thought we
[1:28:15] saw the police there we ran back and
[1:28:16] there was people standing at their door
[1:28:17] you know it's like ah you know so there
[1:28:21] something about boys but as after a
[1:28:22] while we grow up and then we here like
[1:28:24] yeah I shouldn't throw rocks at cars
[1:28:26] that's not good you know and that's the
[1:28:28] thing when you hear the voice of God you
[1:28:30] either he it or you'll pay the
[1:28:31] consequences of it yeah there people Sam
[1:28:34] Samson didn't heed the word of God and
[1:28:37] pretty soon he's grinding at the Mill
[1:28:38] going through the grind of life and and
[1:28:41] you know we don't want to be that way
[1:28:42] you don't want to be to that place to
[1:28:44] you ignore the voice of God and then
[1:28:46] drugs and alcohol and divorce and
[1:28:48] sexually transmitted disease and
[1:28:50] bankruptcy and heartaches and pains you
[1:28:52] don't want to go down that road I've
[1:28:54] seen too many go down that road run from
[1:28:56] it run to Christ he'll never do you
[1:28:59] wrong he'll give you joy and peace Amen
[1:29:02] in your heart I was thinking about this
[1:29:05] brother brand he's in the prayer
[1:29:07] line and we know God gave brother
[1:29:09] brandom a special gift that they would
[1:29:10] come and he would be able to discern and
[1:29:12] tell them brother M said this just be
[1:29:14] Reverend everyone be real quiet and
[1:29:16] listen watch he said now I've been
[1:29:18] speaking to you lengthy right now about
[1:29:20] an hour it's probably about how long
[1:29:22] I've been speaking to you
[1:29:24] he said but one word from God will do
[1:29:26] more than all I could say ministers
[1:29:29] might stand here which are far more able
[1:29:31] to preach than I and still you'd say
[1:29:34] that they really explained it nicely
[1:29:35] that was wonderful see but just let him
[1:29:38] speak one time that settles it that
[1:29:41] settles it I'm not brother brandom to do
[1:29:44] the discernment but God is still God and
[1:29:47] God can speak to every one of you he
[1:29:49] goes on to say in another message he
[1:29:51] said so lady no matter what I would say
[1:29:54] one word from God will mean more than I
[1:29:56] could say in 50 lifetimes but you be the
[1:29:58] judge if you're here for something I
[1:30:00] don't know you know I have no way of
[1:30:03] knowing what you're here for but if he
[1:30:04] does reveal to me like he did to his own
[1:30:07] son the the Lord Jesus to the woman at
[1:30:10] the well then you would believe that it
[1:30:12] comes from God and the lady no doubt
[1:30:15] said amen but what about us today if God
[1:30:17] I'm not brother bam I'm not going to
[1:30:19] stand here and pretend like brother bam
[1:30:20] but I'm here to tell you that Jesus
[1:30:21] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:23] forever and if God speaks to you you'll
[1:30:25] know if it's
[1:30:27] God if you know there's some besetting
[1:30:29] sin in your life and you've hid it from
[1:30:31] mom and dad and brother and sister even
[1:30:33] the pastor or the minister but you can't
[1:30:35] hide it from God he's still a discerner
[1:30:38] today and he'll go all the way down in
[1:30:39] your life and say no but what about
[1:30:42] this he said then you'll know it's God
[1:30:45] and that's what we want to be we want to
[1:30:46] be in the presence of God not come
[1:30:49] together and hear a political speech but
[1:30:51] hear a man of God that surrendered
[1:30:52] himself to God and is is is honest and
[1:30:55] tell you there's a great judgment coming
[1:30:57] that we want to flee the Wrath that how
[1:30:59] do the Bible say it is a fearful thing
[1:31:01] to fall into the hands of an Angry God
[1:31:04] to fall into his hands of judgment we
[1:31:06] want to fall into his hands of mercy so
[1:31:09] many things I was thinking about let me
[1:31:11] just say what if the word of the Lord
[1:31:12] said you must be born again what if the
[1:31:15] word of the Lord came tonight said flee
[1:31:19] fornication what if the word of the Lord
[1:31:21] said come follow me and take up your
[1:31:23] cross and follow follow
[1:31:24] me what if the word of the Lord said
[1:31:27] Jesus Christ is coming soon then what
[1:31:28] does your career mean what does all the
[1:31:30] money in the world what does that
[1:31:32] boyfriend mean what does that girlfriend
[1:31:34] mean if you how's the Bible say what
[1:31:37] would have profit a man if he gained the
[1:31:38] whole world and then he lost his soul is
[1:31:40] this the scripture it's just straight
[1:31:41] out of the book it's God taking a word
[1:31:44] out of the Bible and making it real to
[1:31:46] our life he's trying to guide us as the
[1:31:50] one man said if you go to hell it's
[1:31:51] because you go and you te every bear
[1:31:53] Barcade that God puts up in front of you
[1:31:55] tear it down and say I want to go and
[1:31:57] God puts this little song puts this
[1:31:59] Minister puts this little story in front
[1:32:01] of us and we throw the roadblocks away
[1:32:04] and say I'm going to hell anyway over
[1:32:06] the prayers of my mother over the
[1:32:08] prayers of my father over the prayers of
[1:32:10] a minister that is praying and seeking
[1:32:12] god with a burden let's not go there
[1:32:14] let's go up to our father's house amen
[1:32:17] let's be Christians think about this
[1:32:20] powerful verse you should have this one
[1:32:23] marked in your Bible if you're a young
[1:32:24] person Isaiah
[1:32:27] 5:14 the Bible says
[1:32:30] therefore maybe we should turn to it
[1:32:32] Isaiah 5:14 I didn't give it to the
[1:32:36] brothers the Bible says therefore Hell
[1:32:39] hath enlarged
[1:32:41] herself think about that hell has gotten
[1:32:45] bigger it's enlarged herself and open
[1:32:49] her mouth without measure and you look
[1:32:53] at the sins of our parents and The
[1:32:57] Temptations and you can say this day
[1:32:59] this scripture is being fulfilled with
[1:33:01] the internet and all the lust and Hell
[1:33:03] hath enlarged yourself how's the Bible
[1:33:05] say Amen without majure there's no end
[1:33:09] sure it's a tree of Good and Evil and
[1:33:10] there's good people can work from home
[1:33:12] and earn a living that's the tree of
[1:33:13] good but the evil many times so
[1:33:15] outweighs the the good how many can say
[1:33:18] Amen to that amen may God help us today
[1:33:20] when we see the vomit of the world and
[1:33:23] the social media and the influences and
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:25] perversion yes amen may God help us just
[1:33:29] thinking how we can come to a close the
[1:33:32] Bible says all
[1:33:34] scripture which are the words of God
[1:33:37] that come to a man under inspiration
[1:33:38] think about this Isaiah's just going
[1:33:40] about his day God speaks to him and said
[1:33:42] Isaiah
[1:33:44] Isaiah a virgin's going to conceive like
[1:33:47] okay no Isaiah write it down okay and he
[1:33:51] writes it down he puts it down people
[1:33:52] laugh at him mock died him called him a
[1:33:54] false prophet but God spoke to him and
[1:33:57] the word of God is inspired and the word
[1:33:59] of God will come to pass can you say
[1:34:01] Amen to
[1:34:02] that and I say that these men didn't
[1:34:05] know when the Holy Spirit was moving on
[1:34:07] them that it was the word of the Lord I
[1:34:09] thought about David he said all my bones
[1:34:11] stare at me brother Ram said in one
[1:34:13] place he said if those men had thought
[1:34:15] about what they were saying they
[1:34:16] wouldn't have said it he said all my
[1:34:18] bones stare at me and and it was
[1:34:20] actually he was speaking it was inspired
[1:34:22] word of God and Christ comes later and
[1:34:24] fulfills those
[1:34:25] verses I thought about Abraham how that
[1:34:28] the Holy Spirit moved on him he said
[1:34:29] Israel shall dwell in a Strange Land 40
[1:34:32] year 400 years because the word of God
[1:34:35] spoken under inspiration cannot be taken
[1:34:37] back it will come to pass and if God is
[1:34:39] speaking to you tonight and it's the
[1:34:42] inspiration of God you can't take it
[1:34:44] back it's right and if you don't heed to
[1:34:47] it it'll judge you somewhere that God
[1:34:49] has spoken to
[1:34:51] you you know what I think would
[1:34:54] be if someone sat and heard the voice of
[1:34:58] God speak to
[1:35:00] them and then they did contrary to it in
[1:35:02] hell to just have that 20 second clip
[1:35:05] played over and over and over and over
[1:35:09] you need to get away from that you need
[1:35:10] to repent of your sins you need to be
[1:35:12] filled with the Holy Spirit and hear my
[1:35:15] voice being played over and over and
[1:35:17] that would be hell that would be a place
[1:35:19] of Torment think I could have
[1:35:21] surrendered I could have got away from
[1:35:23] that relationship I could have shut that
[1:35:25] cell phone I could have got away from
[1:35:27] the evil are you with me tonight it's
[1:35:29] God speaking to every one of us not
[1:35:31] group therapy and spray but God speaking
[1:35:33] from the youngest person this little
[1:35:36] lady here that loves the Lord and she's
[1:35:37] seeking the Lord this young man here
[1:35:39] this young man here God speaking to you
[1:35:41] and directing the course of your life
[1:35:43] God doesn't speak to everything
[1:35:45] everybody the same way he speaks to you
[1:35:47] as an
[1:35:48] individual and God has something for
[1:35:50] every one of our lives and if we draw
[1:35:52] close to God he will will draw nigh to
[1:35:54] us I was thinking about the little
[1:35:58] boy and he went to church and he just
[1:36:01] said a b c d e f g h i and he did that
[1:36:08] every and a man come to him and said
[1:36:10] what what are you doing why do you say
[1:36:12] the alphabet in church he said
[1:36:15] well I wasn't raised in a Christian home
[1:36:17] and I don't know how to pray but I have
[1:36:20] this stuff in my heart and I want to
[1:36:22] talk to God about it and I just say the
[1:36:24] the alphabet and I know that he'll take
[1:36:27] the letters and he'll put them all
[1:36:29] together and make the words for what my
[1:36:31] heart is trying to say I can tell you
[1:36:34] that English is a learned language but
[1:36:37] there is a language of God that's much
[1:36:39] deeper than that it's a spiritual
[1:36:41] language where God speaks to you and you
[1:36:43] as a young lady find a place to kneel
[1:36:45] and pray and God begins to deal with you
[1:36:48] God begins to give you the confidence
[1:36:50] that he'll never leave you he'll never
[1:36:52] forsake you he said lo I am with you
[1:36:54] always I will lead you and guide you and
[1:36:57] we need a guide in this day and age we
[1:36:59] are dealing with things in the Church of
[1:37:01] God and parents we things we've never
[1:37:03] seen before it's unprecedented times but
[1:37:05] we've have a holy spirit amen the Bible
[1:37:08] says as the day is so shall your
[1:37:10] strength be and God will be with us
[1:37:11] he'll never leave us I have that
[1:37:13] confidence in him no matter what we've
[1:37:15] gone through brother Ron and sickness
[1:37:17] and heartache and pain and suffering he
[1:37:19] has never left us and he will not leave
[1:37:21] us as long as we believe in him and stay
[1:37:24] with him amen blessed be the name of the
[1:37:26] Lord I have a handkerchief in this um
[1:37:29] pocket that I need I have this problem
[1:37:33] do y'all any of you have problems in
[1:37:35] your life I have a lot of problems all
[1:37:37] right I have crutches like my eyes I
[1:37:39] can't see very good so I wear contacts I
[1:37:40] hide them so you don't see them I've got
[1:37:42] another problem when God squeezes my
[1:37:44] heart my eyes leak it's a problem you
[1:37:47] know but David said a broken and a
[1:37:50] contrite heart God would never despise
[1:37:53] people say I haven't cried in 20 years
[1:37:55] that didn't make you a man that probably
[1:37:57] makes you a brute because the greatest
[1:38:00] man Jesus the Bible says Jesus wept
[1:38:03] shortest verse in the Bible you probably
[1:38:05] did in Sunday school they had a verse
[1:38:07] Jesus wept all right learn another verse
[1:38:09] Bible say Jesus went up over Jerusalem
[1:38:11] and he wept over the condition of the
[1:38:13] church I believe there's still men of
[1:38:16] God who weep over the condition of the
[1:38:19] way the church is going you see people
[1:38:21] get involved in maybe activ and they're
[1:38:24] so caught up in the activities but what
[1:38:25] about the church the church is the
[1:38:27] called out the Ecclesia people that are
[1:38:29] called out from the world and really and
[1:38:31] they weep over the direction of the
[1:38:33] church Real Men of God that have the
[1:38:35] spirit of Jesus Christ do you know any
[1:38:37] men like that are concerned about the
[1:38:38] church and they have a bird and say I I
[1:38:41] just we need to draw closer to God we
[1:38:43] need to get away from the world as Bible
[1:38:45] say if we love the world or the things
[1:38:46] of the world the love of God is not even
[1:38:48] in you we need to draw close to God and
[1:38:50] let God speak to us Real Men of God that
[1:38:52] God speak to us in prayer amen where we
[1:38:55] spend times in prayer that's where God
[1:38:57] makes men real sons of God is in prayer
[1:39:00] when you don't know what to do we need
[1:39:01] to pray the Bible says pray without
[1:39:04] ceasing we that's what's lacking a lot
[1:39:06] of times is prayer we need to draw close
[1:39:08] to God and God has a way of making you
[1:39:11] pray you maybe get away from the Lord
[1:39:14] the Lord will put you on the flat of
[1:39:15] your back in a hospital somewhere amen
[1:39:17] and you'll say all right Lord I'm
[1:39:18] listening because pain is one of the
[1:39:20] greatest attention getters and I don't
[1:39:21] want to get to the place where I have a
[1:39:23] wrecked and my back's broken I'm laying
[1:39:25] there Lord what are you trying to tell
[1:39:26] me no let's just come tonight and say
[1:39:28] Lord will you speak to me will you
[1:39:30] direct my life I don't want to have my
[1:39:32] marriage broke up and kids going
[1:39:34] everywhere and all right Lord I probably
[1:39:36] didn't go to church and I didn't read my
[1:39:37] Bible and I didn't pray but Lord I'm
[1:39:38] listening now I don't want to do that I
[1:39:40] want to say Lord I'm listening tonight
[1:39:43] Lord I'm listening I don't want to lose
[1:39:45] my mind brother B said those girls go
[1:39:47] out and dress in those clothes he said
[1:39:48] they're neurotics they've lost their
[1:39:50] mind Lord I don't want to lose my mind
[1:39:52] and be out there somewhere and a gutter
[1:39:54] somewhere at a bar and somebody's taking
[1:39:55] advantage of me I want to sit in the
[1:39:57] presence of God and get my worth from
[1:39:59] the presence of God and God comes down
[1:40:01] and says I love you and I care about you
[1:40:04] and you're worth
[1:40:06] something oh my how the word of God is
[1:40:09] speaking and pulling
[1:40:11] tonight I I just this little story comes
[1:40:14] to
[1:40:15] mind it's
[1:40:17] something you know I've got another
[1:40:19] problem in my life and I'm just the
[1:40:22] Bible says confess your father fults one
[1:40:23] to another so I have another problem I
[1:40:26] don't have a great memory but I have a
[1:40:29] crutch it's called a computer so I take
[1:40:31] really good notes take a lot of notes so
[1:40:35] before I come I went back and was
[1:40:36] reading my notes and the first time I
[1:40:38] was here is this okay I'm just going to
[1:40:40] tell a story and I'll close Okay in 2017
[1:40:44] we came for the first time and we we had
[1:40:47] the Youth
[1:40:49] Camp up in Prescot and the first night
[1:40:52] the Holy Spirit moved in such a
[1:40:54] wonderful way the Holy Spirit was
[1:40:55] touching hearts and there was eight
[1:40:57] people that stood to their feet and said
[1:40:59] I want to I want to dedicate my life to
[1:41:01] God it was such a beautiful time brother
[1:41:04] Ron and thank God for brother Ron the
[1:41:06] burden that he has to bring us into the
[1:41:08] presence of God God bless you my friend
[1:41:10] sister Sandy she might have slipped out
[1:41:14] but so that was the first night the next
[1:41:17] morning brother Ron said I want to have
[1:41:18] questions and answers he had questions
[1:41:20] and answers all we as young people some
[1:41:21] of you all may have been there wrote
[1:41:22] questions out turned him into brother
[1:41:24] Ron he answered him and the counselors
[1:41:26] however they was they answered him but
[1:41:28] at the end of the service my heart is
[1:41:29] etched with this brother Ron at the end
[1:41:31] of the service I was sitting in the
[1:41:32] sound
[1:41:33] booth and brother Ron said is there
[1:41:36] anybody else that wants to say anything
[1:41:38] is there any counselor wants to say
[1:41:41] anything I was sitting in the back
[1:41:43] because I had to preach that night
[1:41:45] sister Sandy said I I've got something
[1:41:46] to
[1:41:47] say and she said you know last night
[1:41:50] there was eight people that stood
[1:41:53] after the preaching and said I want to
[1:41:55] dedicate my heart to
[1:41:56] God and she is a Godly sister and she
[1:42:01] said but I know that something is
[1:42:03] telling me that there's more than eight
[1:42:05] people that need to give their heart to
[1:42:07] the Lord there's more sisters that are
[1:42:08] not dressing right and problems with
[1:42:10] their hair that they need to dedicate
[1:42:11] their heart to the
[1:42:13] Lord now the word of the Lord is the
[1:42:15] word of the Lord it doesn't matter who
[1:42:17] says it and she made that statement and
[1:42:20] when she did it etched my heart I I
[1:42:22] wrote the notes and here we are seven
[1:42:24] years later I'm quoting it but that
[1:42:26] night when she said that and we came
[1:42:28] back to the service and I preached and
[1:42:30] the Holy Spirit came down in such a
[1:42:32] wonderful way I don't know if you
[1:42:33] remember brother Ron there we had a 5
[1:42:35] hour service and young people coming to
[1:42:37] the front dedicating heart to God
[1:42:40] brother Ron sitting there weeping
[1:42:41] because it's a presence of the Lord
[1:42:43] there's something about the word of the
[1:42:44] Lord when it speaks to you and God you
[1:42:47] sister Sandy and her word to say there's
[1:42:50] more in here that need to dedicate their
[1:42:53] heart to the
[1:42:54] Lord I'm here to tell you that holy men
[1:42:57] of God moved were moved by the Holy
[1:43:00] Spirit and they wrote things down and
[1:43:02] years later you could quote the word of
[1:43:04] the Lord and it would
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:17] reinspection we wrote it down and we can
[1:43:20] read it today and it's
[1:43:23] but as I read that the other day and the
[1:43:24] Holy Spirit came back to my heart and
[1:43:26] said that's the word of the Lord and if
[1:43:29] it was the word of the Lord seven years
[1:43:30] ago I believe it's still the word of the
[1:43:32] Lord tonight there's more people that
[1:43:35] need to dedicate their heart to the Lord
[1:43:38] and I tell you I want to be one of those
[1:43:39] people that dedicate my heart to the
[1:43:41] Lord when God speaks the Bible says
[1:43:44] don't Harden your heart as in the
[1:43:46] provocation but surrender yourself to
[1:43:48] Christ amen let's just bow our heads if
[1:43:51] the musicians will come
[1:43:56] Heavenly
[1:43:59] Father Lord we love you tonight with all
[1:44:01] of our
[1:44:05] heart that little song I
[1:44:09] surrender and Lord as we've just begin
[1:44:12] to speak Lord it seems like a solemnness
[1:44:15] has just come in this
[1:44:18] room Lord I'm not concerned about the
[1:44:20] lights or the cameras Lord I'm just
[1:44:22] concerned conc erned about a word from
[1:44:24] the Lord that would speak to each one of
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:33] us Lord I pray that you would speak to
[1:44:35] every heart
[1:44:37] now Lord every young
[1:44:40] man he would know the voice of God that
[1:44:43] would speak to him the voice of the Holy
[1:44:45] Spirit every young sister Lord the Holy
[1:44:47] Spirit would speak to them
[1:44:49] now as they're playing the song I
[1:44:51] surrender
[1:44:53] I Surrender I give my life to you Lord
[1:44:57] Jesus father I'm standing here as a
[1:44:59] minister with my hands raised to
[1:45:02] you tonight saying Lord I
[1:45:06] Surrender I give my life away to you

[1:45:20] way

[1:45:28] heart May there be no one that walked
[1:45:31] away and say I didn't feel the presence
[1:45:32] of
[1:45:36] God God as the Bible says that Cain went
[1:45:39] out from the presence of the Lord God
[1:45:41] May there be no one that would go out of
[1:45:42] the presence of
[1:45:44] God lord bad things happen when we go
[1:45:47] out of the presence of
[1:45:49] God but Lord when we come into the
[1:45:52] presence of God is the maniac you said
[1:45:54] one word
