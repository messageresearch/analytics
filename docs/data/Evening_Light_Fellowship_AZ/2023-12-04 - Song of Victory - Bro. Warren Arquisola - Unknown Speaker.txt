beach at M midnight it's good to see you brother uh uh Martin from uh Canada I was with brother Stan over there he said hi to you and then um so we we went to paa they the Baghdad that's the name of

th king of saints who shall not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for the th only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest amen let's bow our hand our heads father I I'm a little bit emotional today because truly I'm I am victorious today amen and the Believers Lord here are victorious today that's why we can sing different that's why we can worship different because you're real to your Believers to your people oh some of the people say where is God where can I find him but to us father you're always in our midst Lord thank you

is with him Lord today bless our fellowship today in Jesus name amen amen you can you can have your seats amen what is the song of Moses Moses in Exodus chapter 15 this was the victory of Moses uh when when he saw the enemies drowned at the Red Sea he said then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he had triumphed glor gloriously he the horse and his rider had he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he he has become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him and a habitation my father is God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his host had cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the sea in the Red Sea the DI had covered them they sunk into the bottom as a stone amen now remember this message in Revelation chapter 15 you were there you were singing over there amen meaning to say before you win the battle God knew you already that you are victorious amen hallelujah and I I believe it is you brother brother Brian was singing over there in Revelation chapter chapter 15 amen amen all of us amen thank you amen before we win the battle it's already we're already there singing the victory song Praise the Lord amen you know sometimes to have to to sing the victory song you need to fight first you need to win the battle first how can you sing I am victorious but you're not fighting amen and then over there in heaven you see it's I I was thinking it's it's so noisy it's there's no there's no person over there sitting without singing all of us are singing over there singing Hallelujah to the lamb amen yes so if you scream today you're practicing right now Hallelujah there was a brother a Baptist brother went to the meeting of brother Branham and uh h h brother he meet brother Bram the next day he said brother Brenham I like the the message but the woman next to me she was screaming she was singing she was she was she was crying and according to him he said that's just got on my nerves so bad and then brother brandham said oh I uh uh uh oh I should do uh I said oh it should do that he said well I can't imagine Heaven being like that I said sure can he said well that just made shiver run up on my back and brother Brandon said if you ever go to heaven you freeze to death if you hear that noisy group up there oh you're this in the the quietest place here ever live I'll tell you that CA if you go to hell there be whipping and wailing and nashing of tee wherever you go either way it's so noisy amen over there in hell it's painful it's be people over there are screaming are crying and and and uh because of the pain day and night day and night for millions and millions of years of pain amen we never know when it will going to end but here the prophet said in heaven he said the angels Don't Stop day and night screaming holy holy holy God Almighty amen thank oh see such hallelujah and amen and praise the Lord lord well you never heard such till you hear that meeting up there that's why in in either way brothers and sisters from now on you need to practice if you're Victorious you need to to to tell to anybody that you're Victorious don't sit quiet amen the prophet said before God will put you to the hole of Fame you will pass the hle of critics this is our training ground here we're fulfilling our our destiny if God choose you before the foundation of the world you're acting like it amen you're acting like like one of us one of them glory amen the prophet said here just remember all masterpieces before they can ever get uh put into the Hall of Fame they have to go through their all the hle of critics first the critics has to see if they can criticize it they they were born as a critics they went to school to be critics there are there are are are are people here in the church that will criticize you sometimes well because they were born they're professional critics but to to just to to give you strength also to know your position because remember the the Christian will face trials every day that's right now you will you don't know if you pass the trials if you if no one will say if no one will will will something will will tell you something you know sometimes the critics will be there to tell like you know the story of the the the man or Jesus knocking at the door the critics was was uh watching that that painting and the the the the critic saw it was perfect but he said there was no latch outside how can he open the door so he he he wrote that and he criticized the painter but then the painter said I made it that way amen because the one inside is the one will open the door you know sometimes the critics makes mistakes sometimes they criticize you but that God ordained you to do that we the the Christian don't make mistakes the prophet said here the message identified Master B he said he uh God's son or son passed to the critics of every organization denomination even till pilate said I I I find no fault in him amen Judah said I betrayed the innocent one the innocent blood then God raised him up and he hangs in the Great Hall of Fame today Jesus he went to to to the lowest city he he went to uh to to to to he he look he look up to the shortest man zakus look look Jesus he humbled himself amen even the shortest man he look up the shortest man from Jerusalem amen but because he humbled himself God raised him up so high that now his name is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen amen the prophet said that's the way God does his church he gives you trials after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until The Life of Christ reflected in you until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready submissive willing uh willing turn your head on the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary to the one who is doing the beating amen see sometimes we we forget that he won already but because of him we're Victorious he was the one doing the beating amen amen now he said here to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection of man can see the reflection of Christ in you Christ in you the hope of glory see that test and after test trials after trials test after test trials after trials to to reflect Jesus Christ in you amen but if you don't know first you will struggle you will question but it's the will of God amen amen you know sin sometimes will stop you from singing It's really good as as my experience as a Christian it's really good you feel something very close to him once you have a very heavy trials in your life and then once you overcome the trials you can kneel down during the night and pray to him and you cannot stop the tears from your eyes how many of you how many of you experience that brother Neil you cannot stop the tears from your eyes how God he was faithful to you when you were in the hospital amen and he's faithful to you right now amen every time I see brother Neil I see Victory that's why the the the the song of brother Robert is different because every time he sees you here he see Victory amen there was uh a a brother his name um who is the the man SS only believer Paul Raider when Paul Raider was dying everybody was crying in his room and then Paul Raider I think he all of the sudden he he stood up he said who's dying me or you amen I am victorious right now I will see him today give me a song of Victory and everybody was singing uh a a a a song of Victory down at the cross where my savior died amen down where amen my my from sin oh I need to sing now but here in in Psalms 137 because of sin it sto them from singing uh Psalms 1371 it said here by the Rivers of Babylon there was sat down yay we weep see instead of singing the singers were crying we whipped when we remembered San supposed to be a song of s but here they're just remembering what the goodness what when they were singing when they were happy when they were playing with their Harps he said we hang our Harps upon the Willow in the midst thereof the whipping Willow Tree they hang their Harps three brother for there they that carried us away captive Satan captiv them yeah required of us a song and and the and the enemies wants them to sing and they that wasted as required of us mer saying sing us one of the song of Zion and how shall we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land fifth for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that waste us wasted us required of us merch saying sing all is it Fifth right if I forget thee o Jerusalem let me right hand forget their cunning so here was the singers because the the children of Israel worship the idols and Jeremiah prophesied that they will be captive and the and Jerusalem will be ruined and the singers will be weeping that's why if you if you go to the book of lamentation they were crying they were weeping why what happened the song of Zion is not there not there anymore right instead they left their Harps they they they they cannot sing anymore because of the enemy pressure them see the Believers it's it's the same with us once you are in a heavy battle and you are not winning this battle you come here to church it seems like something holding you something something pressuring you Satan is telling you how can you sing to the Lord you're doing your filth outside side and then you come here and sing to him shame on you and you Believers that doing that I experience it amen we will experience this because this is the land it's not our land Satan is here all the time his his his main purpose is to destroy us now here he will pressure us don't sing don't glorify him and now here you are brother Robert and brother brother uh Mark is singing here but something holding you not to sing on Amen but once you overcome depression once you overcome oppression there you once you overcome the habits that you have brother I I will tell you you will stand up here and worship Him Brother David don't care if you stand up next to him he will praise with you he will he will stand up with you because we are here to worship him our our mind our purpose to be here is to worship him you know sometimes I I struggle all the time every time I preach here and I go to my car and my kids will tell me Daddy you're supposed to say this and that pressure but I don't care as long as I worship him oh brother my my voice sometimes is it's it's uh you know sometimes I I speak a Filipino English but I hope you understand it am I was thinking when the brother told me brother the the the the the language over there in heaven is French I said I think it's Filipino he said because the the the uh the the brother prophesied in French the the the the the the scripture said here in Acts chapter 16 19 to 25 I will and when her master saw this this this man this possessed woman they use her to get money from the people now Paul rebuked this woman and the guy lost his business so now 21 and teach custom and they are uh not loal for us to receive uh neither to observe being Romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrate rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them this is Paul and Silas upon them they cast them into uh prison into prison charging the charging the Jailer to keep them safely who have having received such a charge trust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast into stocks Paul and Silas are not criminals they're inside the prison at that the same time they tied their feet and unto the and into the inner prison and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them so they're not like singing praying in just two of them can hear it they were praying loud voice with a loud voice Brothers amen they were singing with a loud voice that that whole prison heard them the whole prisoners heard them yes Hallelujah and maybe Silas lift up his hands and say I bless your name amen I bless your name am give I'll give you honor and I will give you praise amen and because of the prayers and because of the songs they did not look the situation they did not look the pain they did not check how big is the the swollen in their legs but in the midnight they were singing a song of Victory because they were beat for the cause of Christ hallelujah amen I bless your name how can you bless if you're in pain but to the Believers pain or no pain I will worship [Applause] Him Watchman how many knows Watchman he was a a missionary evangelist from China when he accepted the message or that when he accepted Christ he started sharing the Gospel wherever he go but then the Comm communist China came in in 1949 they persecuted maong said religion is poison so all ministers all Christians we will put them to jail or into the to the prison camp and you know what happened Watchman was preaching the gospel he didn't care they put him into prison but in prison he kept writing he kept writing about about the love of God and you know what he died in prison for uh he was in prison for 21 uh 21 years they supposed to release him but the government said EXT extend him he's dangerous they extended until he died the family did not see the body because they don't want they want to erase that watch money to the whole China but then the Watchman was writing he said here the happiest persons are not always the one who have the loudest praise the loudest praise comes very often from the one who are passing through hardship that kind of Praise most pleasing to God and is blessed by him God does not want men to praise him only when when they are in the Mountaintop surveying Canaan the promis land God desires much more to see his people writing Psalms and praising him when they walk through the valley of the Shadows of death Glory it's good if you have money to praise God right but what about if you don't have food in your table what about if you're if you see cancers eating your body what about if your your loved ones are telling you I'm not going to church with you anymore it's painful but it's good to praise God very good there was a man in 1800 this man they put him into a a uh uh uh into a mental institution but then when he died the the the people from that building went in and cleaned his body took his body and cleaned the the the room and on the wall there was a word said could we with ink the ocean fill and where the Skies of parchment made where every stock on earth a quail and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of God would drain the ocean dry that's right come on not could the scroll contain the hole through stretch from Sky to Sky if I will write the love of God if we will write our testimonies our pains and victories it will contain the whole world because of the love of God Amen that's right to them it's a crazy man but to God is a faithful servant sometimes sometimes we can create a song from our hearts brother Justin can can compose a song because of his experience you're not composing a song brother Justin or brother Moses here composing a song that from from uh maybe I will I will take the the lyrics of Frank Sinatra and I will sing I did it my way or I will maybe change he did it in his [Applause] way it's not our way it's his way Amen brother brandham if you look his story according to him when he was when he was looking at the the the Min Ministry of will uh Billy Graham oral Robert um the other brothers he said they have nice buildings they have they have a beautiful Stadium but when he went back to his room he said I was there before I was I was preaching before them them I was ahead of them but then here's the the big denominations are growing millions and millions of followers but every time he go home he go to the office he said I see only one typewriter it's there's no iPhone 12 or iPhone Mac and he you know he he he had complex and he said Lord look at the ministry of Billy Graham the ministry of oral Robert and here I am I need to answer the the writings of the of the the people that wrote letters to me but I will type there's no voice command but here's the The Voice Came From Heaven yes I am your portion I am your portion but then because of his complexes people doesn't want to listen to him he was he was he was like Moses that people lost the desire to listen to him and he said maybe I will go to the mountain I want to be a Trapper but then here's God always God is so faithful Brothers if we Tred to run away from him he will run go after you amen thank you Lord he came to God came to him come here did you see that three Mountain pcks I put your name in there seven mountain peak amen yes and that I found out brother Russell I found out that that that mountain peaks the name of that is uh Branham mountains I don't know who put the name branam mountains but God knows what he's [Music] doing you know when correct me if I'm wrong brother Bob brother Bob you were there when when he was preaching the wings of the snow white dub right how old were you that time 17 17 years old his action when he was preaching is I can tell he was in pain huh he was he was struggling when he was preaching because he was was telling that when he said every seven years Satan come and torture his body the do the Mayo Clinic told him you cannot get over it it will visit you all the day of your life until you die the pain one other doctor told him he tell he told that over there huh in the wings of this snow he said the one of the doctor told him because your dad is an uh Irish man and your mom is a half Indian you are a hybrid that will come to you every time so every years every seven years he suffered he don't really know what to do he said I am a a neurotic for the whole the the whole uh how do you say uh how how he say he said I was a neurotic neurotic it's a problem in the head right neural problem so but then when he saw the vision there was a squirrel that jumped on uh in in his mouth and it the the squirrel entered in his stomach and that costed him every time uh every seven years a pain in his stomach he cannot really move he cannot really go to the kitchen but then one day his mom uh there was a voice said it's only 6 in long and then his mom dreamed about the seven dubs and he said I'm looking for uh no the six DBS but he said it's my enemy is six number number of men but he said I'm looking for a seven and he keept praying about the seven but one day when he was in Catalina Mountain there was a squirrel again in his vision that jumped again in his like to to his mouth but then it uh it it went to his chest and it hit the the the squirrel went to the to the um I think to the jumping cactus and the squirrel died and he said your enemy and the voice said your enemy is dead but he need a confirmation he was looking for the seventh dub but then brother when when when the the I think God woke him up to go back to Catalina Mountain but when he was walking over there he saw the white pigeon the white dub looking at him and he said I I I I I am healed and then he went to to Louisiana and preach on the wings of the snow white dub so the what is the name of the brother that composed that song brother Bob he was there singing also right but then he said I will I have a a third stanza because this this the on the wing there no white dub it's only two stanzas so he said I composed a third one and he said though I have suffered in many a way I cried for healing both night and day by but Faith wasn't forgotten by the father above he gave me his sign on the wings of a dub Hallelujah on the wings of a snow white dub am that's what he was preaching over there he composed that song because of pain of struggles after the victory he can he composed the song Amen amen there was a woman this woman there was uh groups of drunkards and the groups of drunkards was was uh making fun of the religions Hypocrites they're Hypocrites you know they go after for the money of the people but then there was a man was was a Christian oh not not a Christian but his wife was a Christian he said I think my wife is different with them and uh the group of the the drunkard said how can you say it he said well see for yourself let's go to the house so he invited all the drunkards in his house and and they they said we will act like crazy so we will we will we will we will show up and uh we will we will uh tell her what to do and this woman she opened the door and they were like you know walking make me a a ham and eggs and the other one said make me a maple uh uh cookies I don't know what give me a make me a hot and cold chocolate and while they were they were uh acting like crazy when when after she cooked she gave the food to the to the to the drunkards and the drunkards slammed the plate I don't like the way you cook the eggs and the the the the the the plates was shattered all over the place and the the drunker said let's go boys I don't like her since I married her my and you know what happened she said when she was picking the the shattered glasses or glass and the plates she said must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me the consecrated cross I'll bear Till Death Shall Set Me Free and then go home my crown to wear for there's a crown for me she won the battle there when the Dr was listening to that song right right there they gave their hearts to the Lord brothers and sisters people may think that the religion is a is a fake the religion is nothing the religion there's no more no more h a genuine Christian but there is one that can prove and I believe that's us yes not only because we we act like Christian we wear clothes like Christian we hair we cut hair like Christian but we live like Christ we act like Christ that there right there the drunkards gave their hearts to God Amen in Revelation chapter chapter 15 it said here and I saw as there were a sea of glass mingled with fire yes and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast over the image over his Mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and they sng the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and through just and through are thy ways the king of saints who shall not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for th judgment are made manifest amen think about this the prophet said here Revelation chap 68 Satan comes with with the death and Hell Followed him that was the Destroyer they destroyed everything he said who was them see all right Antichrist called that hell and follow uh hell follow watch this four point scheme Antichrist the White Horse kills the spirit being Antichrist Spirit kills the number two red horse kills the sword political power when church and St State United black horse Souls when he gave out his Doctrine and she did there with their fornication and the weight out of their food by this uh by a sold their what they give for food for a balance uh and the pennies and so forth number four Fort and Pale Horse Eternal separation from God again 4 C he said look at this Satan when Moses was singing he was singing about the horses of the Egyptians their enemy was the Pharaoh but the Pharaoh sent his horses in the last days our enemy are the four horses also Satan is riding to four powers to destroy the Believers to destroy the world exactly and most of the people went in to his vices but there are few Believers that overcame the black horse the White Horse the red horse and The Pale Horse because God also was riding to this four beast when Satan was riding to the White Horse the spirit of the Lord ride with Paul the lion amen when Satan changed the the horse to the to the black horse to the red horse God was riding also with the ox now all the powers are com uh fighting to each other Satan always think that he will win the battle but in the last days he joined all the powers the Catholics Catholic power the political power and then the mark of the beast but then in the last days also once he gathered all the powers the White Horse the red horse and the black horse became Pale Horse and this horse is so shiny so tempting but it's death that's right that's right but look at the Believers God gathered all his people also from the four corners of the world the prophet said here oh now in Revelation chapter 19 not only is the is gathering is getting ready but Christ is getting ready ready to meet him the battle is to be hot and heavy Christ in Revelation 19 Christ is gathering his not from the four corners of the Earth because there's going to be a battle be uh uh uh battle uh going to be little B Remnant what's he doing he is gathering them from the four corners of heaven will get them Sals under the altars tomorrow uh this is a promise and when you see where it's right or not four corners of Heaven on a Snow White Horse Satan has a a white horse but God has a Snow White Horse amen these are the Believers he also has a name not that but the word of God the word of God life amen God wrote right on his uh thighe here the word of God that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life there is soe and he he has got Thro life riding on a white horse and here is a man with three different powers mix up cette Gathering his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathering his heaven born subject Saints that's me that's you Brothers amen he has got death wrote on him Christ got life wrote on him Hallelujah who with him are on the White Horse white horses also and they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world of the amen and they are faithful to the word yes amen and the prophet said I like that one called The Chosen before the foundation of the world amen sure amen is that it amen I think that's it so now here are the the the the the four Beast the B the White Horse the red horse the black horse it became Pale Horse but then when the enemy will come like a flood God will raise up his Saints a standard amen God will not allow you to be destroyed by Satan because his name is is in your foreheads Brothers God will not allow Satan to win before the foundation of the world you're the winner Hallelujah you were there singing sing the song of Victory Brothers the the the the the spirit of the Lord there was so many so many um um uh beasts and animals but God Anointed The Flying Eagle amen God Anointed The the spirit of the flying eagle that the every time the eny will come it will rise up and fly higher amen amen Satan cannot destroy you Satan cannot stand because you have the word of God his his his groups from the four corners of the world but the the group of the Lord is from the four corner of heaven and then he's holding Seven Stars in his right hands and the sword coming out from his mouth has two- AED Sword and the word of God is a two- AED sword look at the sword brother it will hit even the marrows of your bone it can discern the thoughts of the Mankind we have the word of the Lord when brother Brenham was was praying on that mountain yes right the sword of the Lord was in his hand amen he thought it's a it's a a king's sword but God said this is not a regular sword this is not a sword from the from Amazon this is the king sword that can catch the enemy no one will stand against you Brothers oh when this man when the saints when when when when uh when Nero was persecuting the Christians he wants to destroy all the Christians but then God anointed the ox age and here was the Christian they put them into the lion's then they destroy they they crucified them up and uh upside down they burned them into the stakes they tortured them them just to deny the name of the Lord but what did they say they stood up in the middle of the arena and said ah I pledge allegiance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I am I will please to worship
