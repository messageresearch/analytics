world Worship in the spirit [Music] amen to Worship the Lord is one of the greatest privileges we can have the Angels were created for worship we were created for Fellowship but we love to worship deep within our beings is a desire just to lift up and magnify the Lord he's worthy of it he is worthy of our worship he's worthy of our service of our Adoration of all that we are given to him it's just bow our heads in the word of Prayer Heavenly Father we love you we're so thankful for your spirit and your presence that's here according to a Divine promise that where two or three would be gathered together you would be in their midst and we recognize your presence here Lord we want to entertain your presence Lord we want to make you feel welcome Lord we don't want you to be off in a corner with dirty feet and and not welcome Lord we want to open up our hearts and we just want to welcome you here Lord and we want to worship you Lord I just asked tonight that you would open up the word of God to our hearts I pray that you would encourage and strengthen the young people here Lord father may they leave this place knowing you in a greater way Lord walking with you a little bit closer Lord father I pray that you would just have your way in this service now pray that this vessel would be yielded in your hands may you be glorified Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you tonight good to be here and to see all these faces here and to recognize a few of them I'm I'm struggling with names enormously but I love you just the same and if you have your Bibles let's open up to the Book of Proverbs we'll begin there appreciate the the invitation and the the privilege to minister to the young people here and you know there's there's nothing good in any man there's nothing I have that I can give you that you need but there is something that I have that I can't give you that you need and that's my Lord Jesus but I'm believing that by a Divine gift tonight we can go into the word of God and your heart can reach out and take a hold of what God has for you Proverbs the third chapter the fifth verse says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths I want to read that together verse 5 it's going to be a bit of a theme tonight but together aloud trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding you may be seated tonight in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths now as young people and facts are as older people lots of times you're just not sure which way to go you're not sure which path to take which direction to turn and that's because you've never done this before this is your first go-around and you need somebody a whole lot smarter a whole lot wiser and that's God and he said that he would direct your paths but it said acknowledge Him in all thy ways and that word acknowledgment is is just beautiful it speaks of a an acceptance or an admitting of the existence or the truth of something there's an acknowledgment it's uh in a way you could you know this person standing here I acknowledge that uh Austin's sitting here I acknowledge it I recognize it I say ah yes Austin and you know oftentimes when you're walking by and you see somebody you know you just kind of Nod your head like hey I see you there it's a knowledge acknowledgment in everything you do say yes Lord I see you're there yes Lord I recognize your presence here I acknowledge you I recognize who you are now direct my paths in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths that's a whole uh a whole sermon we can go right on there but I want to focus on leaning not to your own understanding and for a text I want to take an eternal Foundation and right here uh I want to read a quote Bram says in the sermon uh trying to do go out of service without it being his will he says may our hearts continually be set on thee and we know Lord that money and property and things of the world have no meaning just so temporal all of them must go our jobs our places our friends everything must go no matter how rich how poor how popular or unpopular we are it all must go but there is only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's Jesus Christ so right there is the center of your life that's the center of everything to you is Jesus Christ so God let us lay aside everything as secondarily and hold to him and he is the word Granite Lord the Vindicated word of the hour what is that this message the Vindicated word of the days of Moses was Jesus the Vindicated word of the days of Isaiah Elijah John all was Jesus and the Vindicated word today is Jesus the same yesterday today and forever help us Lord to believe that see that and walk in it we ask in Jesus name oh if you can get a picture of what the center post is it's Jesus Christ and it's Jesus Christ as he has been revealed to us through the message of this hour not the message of Noah's day in Noah's day there was a message and it was Jesus Christ the Ark of Safety but please don't go build a boat right now that's not the message for right now you've got to recognize where Jesus Christ is right now and you must Center your life on that and Jesus Christ is the word the message of this hour now in Matthew the seventh chapter I'd like to to uh turn if you'll open up your Bibles there Matthew the seventh chapter seventh chapter and verse 24. and uh this is some a verse that everyone here is familiar with says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them that's a very important and and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon Iraq and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and do with them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it now this is the the common little Sunday school song We Sing uh maybe you don't sing it anymore but the wise man built his house upon the rock you know it's kind of a little simple song We Sing we're all familiar with it but right there if you can catch the revelation of that right there your life will be completely different if you will build your life upon that rock upon that solid foundation of the word of God he says basically what Jesus is saying here is whoever hears me and obeys my word his life will be solid it'll be built upon a rock says in the oncoming storm he says Jesus was speaking here he reads this text in his sermon speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man and every woman that's born in the world how many have been born in the world here what about you okay just checking everyone even that's been born in the world you all qualify if you're here breathing you qualify so here's an update for you a storm's coming your way every man and every woman that's born in this world there is just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime or other and depends on what kind of foundation that you have whether your house will weather it or not there has been many lives saved because of preparation for storms and there's been many alive lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming now you may or may not feel like storms are something you really need to worry about you might feel like life's going good you might feel like life's going bad I really don't care what exact stage of that you're in I can tell you whether you realize you're in a storm or whether you don't see a storm there's a storm coming it's gonna happen and you need to be prepared and ready when that storm comes and it's a matter of life and death so what's your life built on what is your foundation what are you building your life on and as young people you've got plans you've got Ambitions uh I mean some of us probably still don't know what we want to be when we grow up but some of us probably have an idea I know my Dad still hasn't figured out what he wants to be when he grows up but at least that's what I heard him saying um but for some of you you have a plan you say this is what I'm going to do this is where I'm going you've got a direction you've got an ambition and that's good purpose is an important thing you should have a purpose but your foundation the foundation of it all must be solid and that stability is not going to come out in this world it's not there and the other place it's not going to come from is your own mind lean not to your own understanding don't do it do not trust in your own mind to guide you but acknowledge Him turn to him trust in the Lord don't lean to your own understanding here programs talking about uh this foundation and if you have a foundation problem there's something you should do if you have a foundation problem and that's not you know repaint the house um he says now don't build upon that alone that intellectual Faith he's talking about how intellectual faith is it's a good thing to a point like you need to at least believe the word of God with your mind that's a great starting point like Okay I accept that that's the word of God that's a good starting place but he says that's not enough alone and he goes on here he says brother wood and he says somewhere in the building as a contractor he says well what good would it do for him to take on a building that's worm eaten the termites has eaten the building down and it's rotten to the foundation and he goes out and he gets some of the best Lumber that he could find good dry seasoned Redwood tack it on the home go out here and get paint that's just recommended by the highest paint country contractor in the company in the world see look here preacher I can show you that this is real genuine Redwood I'd say yes brother wood that's right look here it's real seal of approval that this is the best paint that could be put on a house that's right brother wood but your foundation is wrong it's got to come down and that's what's the matter reading the scripture is Right preaching the gospel is right that's why we're doing it it's right but your foundation is wrong tear out your mental conception of things and get God In Your Heart by the shedding of the blood and then build from there if you've got your own mental conception of here's how God should do things hear how this should be here's the direction what I'm going to make my life stop tear it down and say God I'm coming to the foundation of a experience with Jesus Christ and I'm going to build from there a life that is yielded in your hands now if we were to to look at it purpose is a very challenging thing to really nail down like what is your purpose why I mean you're all sitting here breathing for some reason because we're not here by chance God placed you here on this Earth for a reason you're here for a purpose you have been chosen and placed here in this particular hour now what is that purpose and the only one that can really tell you that is the one who placed you here but your purpose your is the your purpose your foundation they all go together and so I would be asking the question what is your foundation what is your life built on your life is built on something there is something your life is built on what is that what is that Foundation could something Shake That Foundation will that Foundation pass away is it an eternal Foundation if it's not some point in your life a storm is going to come the winds are going to blow and you will fall but if you've been built Upon This Rock if you have anchored your life in Christ Jesus the winds can blow the storm can howl and that house will stand now a lot of the inspiration that I get for this is from a beautiful sermon brother brand preached called lean not to thine own understanding if you have a pencil and a paper here anybody have a pencil and paper here take out your pencil and paper and I want you to write down this sermon lean not to your own understanding unto thine own understanding it's 1965 January the 20th and it was preached here in Phoenix that sermon is just beautiful goes on in that sermon speaking about how Solomon reads this he reads this verse lean not unto thine own understanding it shows how Solomon is is telling them he says I don't think he was telling them not to get an education he says that's you know that's something that's it's good it's nice to have an education and so much of our Lives is focused on you you get up you go to school you get your high school and then you finish with your your high school you go on to your college or whatever you're doing it's it's focused on education education education for years years of your life focused on education and that's all right that's that's not a bad thing but that is not what you're going to understand God by Solomon was trying to advise his sons not to be illiterate but not to lean to their understanding that understanding will never tell you the realities of the word of God it's a finite mind Solomon was telling him that when you get to the end of your life you come down to the end of the road after death is the judgment and God's not going to ask you hey uh can I see your Bachelor you know your degree do you have a degree um like I really need to see that to to see if you qualify for heaven I no like you all know that's absolutely ridiculous God could care less what kind of an education you have when you get to the other side he will not ask about your education he will not ask about how many degrees you have he will not ask how well you understand geometry he's not concerned about that but there is something that he's going to ask he's going to ask you what you did about the understanding of God's word that's where the requirement comes because that your education is fine but the word of God is live it's education is sand you cannot build your life on the sand education doesn't work so what about the American dream of money and prosperity you know we're going to build our life around finances we're going to I mean if you guys aren't working then you need to get Christ in your heart because all Christians work but you need to have that ambition you need to have a desire to actually be productive member of humanity but that is not your purpose your purpose is not to have a lot of money that's not what God created you for he didn't create you to go out here and work nine to five for 40 years and then die the day after you retire and that was the end of your life and what did you do that's not the focus of your life is your Prosperity the money you can't build on that what is that sand that's not a solid foundation what are you building your life on what is the foundation of everything in your life you know there was that man who was really prospering he was really prospering after he walked away from Jesus he was the Rich Young Ruler he was asked will you follow me and when he realized that it was going to cost him that job opportunity that he wanted to have or whatever it was he says no I can't do that and when he went you know what his finances didn't fall apart they got better they got better and better until he was so busy pulling down Barnes and building bigger ones and trying to figure out what he was going to do with his 401k and all of his excess funds he just didn't know what to do with them and how is he going to store them in these Barns and while he's planning all of his riches God looks down and says Thou fool this night your soul is required and you know he lifted up his eyes in hell he said oh God let me go back and preached to my family and tell them tell them don't go the way I win don't build your life the way I did it don't do it he says they have the prophets they have Moses if they won't obey the word you think they're going to believe a man raised from the dead he had a burden for Souls once he stepped into an eternal perspective once he realized what it was really all about he wasn't asking you know can I go and make that last business deal of course not you know hey I almost had that Barn finish can I just go back and finish it he didn't care but you know what he didn't care about that those people he loved would not make the same mistake he made follow the same path he went and fall in the Calamity that he went in Matthew chapter 6 33 it says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you those things you know food and raiment and a house to live in that's good God will add it if you seek him first you place God as the foundation of your entire life let everything be built upon that and God will add everything else you need the Branham says here about trying to build your life around being a beautiful girl he says sometimes a pretty girl her beauty becomes a curse to her she finds it out and somebody tells her about it and she wants to be like some movie star or something instead of trying to pattern her life after Jesus Christ she builds her whole Foundation upon that and not knowing that she's only got five years of real life from 15 to 20 and then she starts dying and you base your whole hope upon that knowing that you got to get old if you live you've got to get old you've got to break down and the Beauty full face that you'll have will rot out there in the grave someday and the bugs will eat it up so there's no Eternal foundation on popularity or who you are or what you are that has no real Foundation it's not there popularity what your friends think about you do not try and build your life off of the Hat for one thing it's it's not only you know sand it's extremely Shifty Sands it's constantly changing you can't build your life off of you know the collective opinion of your teenage friends or your 30 year old pins or your 50 year old friends or whatever they are it's just not going to work because one day they're going to have an opinion this way and that's what he said but then you go talk to to them over there and they said the exact opposite and you'll end up just being a circus clown running around in circles trying to please everybody and finally pleasing nobody and being miserable you can't build your life off of people's opinion you can't try and change yourself based off of well this person says I should be this way or where I'm going to try and be more like that person or I want to be that person no no you can't build your life off of an imitation of someone else brother Brown he says this now I love it he says now because she did it I will too because he did it I will to you that's hypocrisy you are what you are by the grace of God and just be yourself God will love you better and the people will love you better too if you'll just be yourself be honest sincere and what you do and God will bless your efforts really focusing on Ministry there people trying to be this type of person or that type of person he says just be yourself now that's not a cop-out okay you don't just say well you know my natural self is just grumpy so I'm just going to be myself no that's not what we're trying to get at here or well just be myself well I just don't feel like being in church today is that the self we're talking about no you know as a minister you know I I recently I was uh with another Minister and and God gives him a lot of visions and he's he uh is give has a gift of discernment and he sees things in people's lives and he'll pray with them and just to see that that gift like that it's amazing it's amazing to see a supernatural gift like that he was born that way he was that way when he was out a drunkard on the street it's just a gift in his life but to see how God can use a person like that to speak into a life and things that I know that's there and somebody else he doesn't have a clue you know their name and he'll be just praying for them and also and he'll just stop and I I remember one situation we were standing at a prayer line and this sister came up and she was just like oh I just want to have more of God I'm like it just didn't resonate it didn't it didn't resonate it was just like well that's good and I'm like I'm trying to enter in I'm like well all right you know we're gonna pray for more of God and I was trying to enter into that prayer it just wasn't there and this brother's just standing there and he just starts staring at her very peculiarly and then he just says you demon of suicide I come against you in the name of Jesus Christ and she hit the floor because that's not what she came up for that's not what she was standing there saying but there was a spirit of God that discerned that and God was able to do something for that sister now I like seeing God help people I like seeing God do things like that for somebody and so inside of me is like well you know I'd like to be like that but I can't if I try to be anything other than the way God Made Me I'll be a hypocrite but the me that I want to be is the me that comes from dwelling in the presence of God it's the me that comes from dwelling in the holiest of holies and the Shekinah Glory where Aaron's rod budded and brought forth almonds and fruit in one night that's the me that I want to be I don't want to be the me that's an old Dead stick that was just left out in the wilderness I want to be the me that comes from dwelling in the presence of God dedicated as a life of service to him I want to be me but I want to be that mean be the you that's your full potential in Jesus Christ who God actually made you to be not what your college career advisor said you should be now there's been people who built their life upon that Solid Rock and you know they didn't really fit in they were different there was a farmer one time and he said a voice spoke to him and told him to go build a boat and he did and everybody said he was a nut and he stood there in the door of that Ark crying out judgment's coming there's a storm coming destruction's coming you've got to hear my words you've got to get into this Ark and he stood there in that door and they laughed at him they mocked him they says we're fine we don't need what you have he says it's the only way you'll survive get into this Arc they didn't heat him not only did their lives wash away but the fact is they they were enabling us to get to church tonight as fossil fuel they didn't heed the message of their hour and they were destroyed Moses stood there in the doorway crying out come underneath this Blood dripping down the lentils of the door get into the behind this door get under this Blood outside of this is death and those who heeded that message those who realized that this was the word for their hour this guy that came walking out of the Wilderness after 40 years of being a runaway criminal he comes walking out of the Wilderness and he's standing there but if I don't obey that message it's death they recognized something that was there you know why it was Vindicated it had been proved that this wasn't just his own idea and they heeded that word and they built their life around what that prophet told them and if they failed to trouble was on the road and death struck left and right in the center every time they would fail to follow the word for that day and they'd start getting impatient with God they'd start saying God you know I know you let us out here I know you did the supernatural I know you did all of these things I know how you've done this but right now I want this and I want it now and they wouldn't even ask they would just murmur and complain instead of asking an all-sufficient all-powerful God to provide their daily need Moses stood there on the word that he had been given and those who came and gathered round that rock had life Joshua and Caleb they stood upon a word that said they could take a land filled with Giants and obstacles and everything impossible to human reasoning as an untrained military army but they said if God's going to give it to us then those Giants are bread it's nothing they stood upon it and what did they do they built their life upon that word that they had received and they did The Impossible they lived a life that's a legend but it's true it was a little girl one time came in contact with an angel and that angel told her she was going to bring forth the Messiah and you know what she believed it she couldn't explain it she didn't understand how it was going to work it didn't make common sense it was not scientific but she believed it with everything that was within her and she says be it unto me according to Thy Word and she manifested what the prophets had been prophesying up for thousands of years because she accepted her purpose she recognized this is why I'm here God has chosen me for this and she yielded her life to that she was criticized she was mocked she was misunderstood said she was a liar said she was immoral it didn't really turn out that well I mean finally he becomes a rabbi and he's crucified naked and she's sitting there at that cross still being ridiculed still being made fun of we're not doing this for Earthly popularity we're not building our life on Earthly success Earthly Ambitions Earthly values that is not what we're here for your life is not to be built upon this Earth's temporal things but so many times it is so many times we build our life around the next promotion at work or the next career opportunity or oh if I do this then that person will like me more if I do this maybe that guy will say something to me and I and it's like hold on hold on Center yourself Center your entire being on Christ Jesus there's many people who have failed to trust in the Lord with all their heart and they begin to lean to their own understanding the first one that ever leaned to their own understanding was Eve and it plunged the entire human race into death because she trusted in her own reasoning trusted in her own perspective of how things ought to be don't do that get yourself to that solid word get yourself to that shirt Foundation build everything in your life on that because everything else will pass away everything else will be shaken what can be shaken will be shaken and if your life is built on anything less than Christ that Solid Rock you will fall because the storm will come it will come and in this day and age it doesn't just come when you're 30 or 40 or 50. you'll face tremendous satanic attacks at 10 11 12 years old we're living in a very dark age but we have a word that brings us light that gives us confidence that gives us a place of Refuge do not lean to your understanding don't lean to your own comprehension of the word of God your own thinking of the word of God well yeah I think it says this but you know I think it really would make more sense if we did it this way and I know God he said not to do that but God's a good God and he really wouldn't kill us and and it probably don't even start as soon as that question mark to the word of God comes across your heart death sets in that's a direct quote so what is the true foundation that your life should be built on Matthias what's your life built on is it built on getting married well that's pretty nice but if your life's not built on Jesus Christ your life will fall apart if your life is built on anything less than Jesus Christ you're heading for a storm and that storm will destroy you remember in that oncoming storm he says but what you need is that wind that came on Pentecost that rushing Mighty Wind that's able to drive back the storm now the word of God is your sure Foundation and I think I've been clear enough that we're not looking at the word of God of Noah's day and going and building a boat the word of God is the message of this hour that you need to have your life built upon if you're building your life upon Noah's message you're in trouble because we're not in Noah's Day friends if you're building your life on Moses's message you're in trouble because this is not Moses's day you've got to recognize your day and its message and find that Solid Rock because that message of the hour is Jesus Christ that's where he is if you wanted to follow Jesus right now you don't go to Galilee and wander around the hills and sleep in boats and live out in the mountains 2000 years ago you did because two thousand well two thousand years ago Jesus would have been a carpenter I think right now but two thousand year goes approximately there was a man and if you wanted to follow him you sold everything you had and he walked around without a home without a job and you followed him but if you want to follow him right now don't go to Jerusalem that's not where he's at he is in the message of the hour this is Christ revealing himself today now do you know the message like you know about it but has God come down and revealed it personally in your heart the God made it real to you because that's the foundation it's the revelation of the word of God when God comes down and he reveals in your heart who he is he begins to reveal his word in your heart and it becomes personable it becomes you in God when God begins to do that you will have a church that is built upon a rock that the Gates of Hell cannot shake down but if it's built on well daddy said this and that about the message and and the Pastor said this well that's great that's wonderful but what did God reveal personally to your heart because when it's revealed to you I don't care how dark that storm is I don't care how hard those winds blow you will have a rock that nothing can Shake You Down now I want to just really nail down this point of not leaning to your own understanding by showing you the comparison of humanity to God and that the simple facts are you're stupid okay God is infinite God is the creator of all heavens and earth and of the universe he's an infinite God he knows every breath that you'd breathe and how deep it would go into your lungs that's infinite now if he's infinite that makes him omniscient that's right and if he's omniscient that makes him omnipresent because he knows just exactly the minute our time to the split instance of a 55th of a second when it's going to happen see get the idea now then he knows all things and that's the reason he has all power knows all things and can do all things this universe that we live in is extraordinarily big it it's you can't understand it uh there's just no way because well we're stupid it's believed that the there are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on every Beach on Earth now that's a lot and you know what our whole personal Universe here is all circled around one star with all of our planets and Mars and Jupiter and Saturn and all this we're all going around one star and those other stars out there have other planets circling around them and there's more stars out there than there are Sands of sea on every seashore and there's multiple planets circling every one of those stars as far as We Know things just got really big and we got really small but then you come down the other way you come down to that microscopic world you come down to that Snowflake and every single snowflake is intricate and unique in itself never found two snowflakes that were the same you get down to that microscopic level of of the the molecules and how they come together and it's an entire universe in there the human body is so complex that they can't even begin to understand the complexities of it how does the brain work how do these things happen they dabble around they they play with it they can't figure it out they're playing with life and when you find out what life is you'll know who God is they can see these things happen but they don't know why it happens that way they don't know what does it they don't understand the reason of it they don't understand what's making it all run you get down to that molecules and you get down to the atomic structure and you have these protons and these neutrons and these electrons spinning around you tell me what makes an electron spin why don't they all just stop what got them started spinning in the first place what is electricity why does it go from one direction to the other direction what is gravity if you're a little bit into science they're not real sure what gravity is now Jubilee knows it what it is she knows that it happens you trip you fall that's gravity but what is it really they don't know what causes a blade of grass to spring up come to life grow in the ground they don't know everything from the immense city of the universe to the microscopic scale and God created it all about just blowing it off of his hand God is infinitely big and infinitely small now I'm going to step into a little bit of math here so if you don't like math just bite your fingers so you stay awake all right now how long ago do you figure one million seconds is 1 million seconds that's about 12 and a half days all right so 1 million seconds is about 12 and a half days now we're going to step it back just a little farther how long ago do you think one trillion seconds is what do you think a lot you got it how many years ago do you think one trillion seconds is a thousand years what do you think 2 000 years girls go way bigger than that what do you guys think what do you think five thousand years now we're getting somewhere you're a McGary by your face I'm pretty sure what do you think the one that's not looking at me last guess was five thousand how much four thousand all right Lilia ten or fifteen thousand it's over 31 000 years ago one trillion seconds is over 31 000 years in the past all right so next time you hear about a trillion dollar budget nobody has a clue what they're talking about one trillion years seconds ago is 30 1710 years ago that's one trillion and in the mathematical world 1 trillion really isn't that big now I'm going to get into something that's downright ridiculous it's called Graham's number uh does anybody here know about Graham's number right of course all right so we have one weirdo here that knows about Graham's number all right so for the rest of you it's a mathematical equation that deals with the graphing and the color combinations that are possible within hyper cubes and higher dimensions and if you're lost don't worry they all are too because they really can't quite grasp what they're dealing with anyway now I'm going to try and explain this to you they're trying to find out the minimum possible combinations in this math problem and the maximum possible combinations in this math problem all right so to do that they had to kind of use a a completely different form of mathematic equations so to start with in this math problem we'll take a three and we'll use a something called up arrow notation all right so you have a three up Arrow three okay that simply means three to the power of three what's three to the power of three 27. all right so now we go one more Arrow all right three up Arrow up Arrow three now what that's done is it Stacks those exponents so now we have three to the power of three but that 3 also has a power of three okay so when we solve that problem down we take three to the power of 3 which is 27 to the power of uh 3 to the power of 27 anyway we break that down we come up with a number that's 7.6 trillion something long now that's a really big number 7.6 trillion that's huge uh now that was with three threes stacked on top of each other okay when you add that third one there no that was sorry 27 20. I think it was 28 threes anyway you add that third one there now you got three up Arrow three to the third power that gets wildly out of control now that exponent going up is seven something trillion tall in exponents okay we're really really big all right and finally we get to the beginning of Graham's number which is three up over Arrow four times to three okay that's the beginning and when we solve this problem which is ridiculously huge I mean the exponents in it are seven trillion High we get what's called G1 it's the starting of the equation okay and so then the next part of the equation you take G1 and you put that in for how many up arrows you put into the equation all right so you've got something quintillion quadrillion up arrows into the equation and you solve that down all right now we did three up arrows no two up arrows two up arrows was already Seven Something trillion all right now they put that's two up arrows they put something quadrillion up arrows into the equation and that gets you to G2 and then you put G2 number of up arrows into it and you get to G3 and you keep doing this keep doing this bigger and bigger numbers until you finally get to Graham's number which comes out at G 64. all right this number is completely Beyond Comprehension there is no way you could actually understand how big this number is they've solved out a couple hundred of the digits in the last and part of it but they'll never get to the end of it because it's too big and they've finally figured out that the answer to this equation that they've been trying to solve is somewhere between seven and g64. somewhere in between there is the correct answer and that's all they figured out but they figure against Infinity they're pretty close now this number is the only number that there was one of the first numbers that was used constructively at a ridiculously large size they were actually able to use it instead of just creating a ridiculous number they were actually using it in a problem now if you could ever actually grasp this number if you could ever actually like if you tried to write it out with your with a pen and pencil uh you'd run out of trees in the universe you'd run out of paper you'd run out of everything you couldn't write it out that's how big the number is how many digits are in it if you could ever actually grasp and see in your mind g64 and what it actually means you would become the most dense object in the universe you would turn into a black hole and you would cease to exist it would destroy you it would physically destroy you if you could ever grasp this number and it is a finite number and heart God is infinite you cannot understand god with your own intellect it's impossible if you ever did somehow grasp the infinite God it would literally destroy you you would cease to exist because you cannot contain that much information within your little p brain you can't do it God knows that he knows you're finite he knows your inability and so he just said listen I'm not going to ask you to understand it all I'm not going to ask you to be able to explain everything but I'm going to tell you this trust in me with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding your own understanding can't even grasp the finite things there is no way you'll ever grasp the infinite so God never asked you to understand it all he said you just trust me I'm a whole lot bigger than you I know a whole lot more than you trust me believe what I'm telling you the only way you're ever going to gra be able to come in contact with me the only way you're ever going to able to to understand these things is just believe what I tell you if I tell you something don't try and sit down and reason it all out don't try and grasp everything with your intellect just believe what I tell you and if you can do that if you can just believe what he tells you it's absolutely unlimited what God can do in your life if you can only believe what's the rest of the song all things are possible because when you accept and believe in God and you believe what he's told you whether you can make sense of it or not I mean facts are you can never reason it out in your mind your human intellect is broken and you can't grasp god with your mind so you believe him by a supernatural contact called faith you say Lord if you said it then I believe it if this is what you said for my life then I'm going to believe it I can't explain it I don't know how the future is all going to work out I don't understand how all the details but if you said this for my life then that is what I'm gonna build my life on because I'm trusting in you oh how we would love to have the tongue and the vocabulary that could explain it to the people what it really is but it could not be found on Mortal lips all eternity doubtless whether it'll ever reveal it how that God Of Heaven ever came to the Earth to say poor lost wretched sinners it'll take all of eternity friends to grasp the depth of the love of God and that's just one attribute that he has oh our life must be built upon the foundation of Christ's word outside of that it will fall you must have your life built upon the Eternal Foundation now how do you do that you say I want my life built on that Foundation if you've got at least a sane mind and you recognize how finite we are and how small we are then you can recognize I want my life built on something that's solid I want my life my ambitions my goals to be built on something that'll actually have value now how do you build your life on that Foundation Jesus said he that heareth my words he or he that heareth my sayings and do with them he's life will be likened to one built upon a rock now all you got to do is do what Jesus said but there's just one problem you can't you can't do it you don't have the ability to live a perfect life you don't have the ability to follow the word of God in your flesh you can't do it but that's what the Holy Ghost was given for to give you power and speech power and prayer and power to live a holy life God knows that you're incapable so he sends a guide he sends the Holy Spirit he sends someone that can come down and live through you and express his word and manifest his word in your life you cannot Manifest this word by yourself you cannot live this message by yourself but if you can come down and you can yield yourself to the spirit of God he will come down and he will live through you and do things through you that you know nothing about but if you try and build your life on your own ability you know we can just get a big blue stamp and stamp right across your life failed it won't work but if the Holy Spirit comes down and enters into your life your life will begin to become a reflection of everything that the prophecies have spoken of regarding this last hour now to musicians would come says here what is the evidence speaking of the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of it when that Spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen and God will confirm it now that's not just a verbal agreeance to the word of God that's not just saying yep it's the truth the devil knows there's a God he's been defeated by him too many times not to know that the devil knows the authority that's in this word of this hour he knows that but he cannot live it but that's exactly the way it is with Jesus Christ they had more speaking in his day they had more fruits of the spirit they had all kinds of evidences you can't pin any evidence down to anything but God himself manifesting his word that's the only true evidence that it's there is that is that is that that you're a Christian when God comes down into your life and something inside of you when you hear the word of God when you see a promise of God that you can be set free that you can be delivered that you don't have to live in this condition that you can receive your healing and there's something inside of you that just said I believe that yes Lord so be it in my life and it begins to manifest you cannot Manifest this word in your own ability you can't build your house solid enough you can't build your life good enough of your own ability it will fall apart but if God can come down and he can live inside of you he can begin to manifest the promise of young people in this hour that are going to overcome every single trap of the devil young people in this hour that are going to overcome laodicea and every snare that it has young people in this hour that are pure and spotless without a wrinkle in their garment trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to your own understanding it's tempting when you're a young person because you know everything right now the little older you get the less you start to know and you'll start to understand why those old people don't know anything trust in the Lord [Music] not your understanding we need to close by Billy Bram talks about how especially the young ministers he says you must Master the thought of human ability [Music] I love how he says that he doesn't say human ability but just Master the thought of human ability if you even think you have ability just start you need to start by mastering the thought that you even have human ability God cannot work through your ability God cannot do anything through your ability your life it has to be his and when you can Surrender Your Life when you can surrender your ability when you can surrender everything that you are into the hand of God God can come down and he can begin to do things through you can begin to use you in Supernatural ways he can begin to use you to do things that are Impossible by human understanding if you can yield every fiber of your being yield [Music] to him stand to our feet tonight [Music] it's just baller heads I'm asking you tonight do you recognize that there's areas in your life where you've been leaning to your own understanding on your something other than that sure Foundation I'm asking you to talk to the Lord about it just say Lord I've been wrong I've been trusting in these other things I've been looking at these other things but I'm wanting to come right now this night and yield my thinking over to you I don't want to trust in my own thinking I don't want to trust in my own ability I don't want to trust in myself but I want to trust in the god that's the creator of heavens and earth heavenly father I'm asking that you would come down here tonight and that you would see these hearts that are here open before you Lord you know every heart you know every aspect of every life Lord you know their thoughts you know where they're at Lord I'm asking that they would recognize that they can't do it by themselves [Music] Lord may they just turn to you with a complete and a total yielding but may they surrender their being into your hands that you might come down and direct their path that you might come down and stabilize and anchor them Lord in such a way that no matter what storm would come no matter what challenge they'll face in life and it will come but you promised that you would never leave us you would never forsake us you promised that if our life was built Upon This Rock that when that hour would come we would be secure [Music] the prophet said there's many that have been saved because of a warning of an oncoming storm so Lord I'm praying for these young people here tonight before they get into that storm before they get into that world that just has them where they don't know hardly which way is up Lord may they have an anchor that will hold them oh [Music] foreign [Music] Lord May each and every heart here trust in you be filled with your spirit forgive us Lord for leading Taro and understanding of things Lord Lord we're stupid Mortals Lord that can't hardly understand anything but we're just yielding ourselves to your great omnipotence Lord we're accepting your word concerning our lives Lord though we can't understand it though we might not explain it Lord I say be it unto me according to your word Lord [Music] bless your children now in the name of Jesus Christ I pray [Music] surrender Just Surrender yourself to him I Surrender [Music] my life [Music] records [Music] Lord I Surrender my life [Music] I give it all to you is that the prayer of your heart tonight [Music] I Surrender [Music] foreign ER Lord I Surrender my love oh give it all to you [Music] I Surrender [Music] ah surrendered [Music] my life I give it all to you verse one [Music] I know your plan for me it is right [Music] and I need you to fulfill your purpose in my life I submit to you my king oh Lord be my everything contrary to you again oh Lord here I am oh Lord here I am surrender to surrender to him oh I surrendered [Music] oh Lord I Surrender my life I give it all to you ah I Surrender [Music] I Surrender [Music] Lord I Surrender my life oh I give it all to you [Music] amen I have a maker [Music] he formed my heart and before even time begin my life was in his face [Music] cause he knows my name and he knows my every thought and he sees each team that falls [Music] and I have [Music] a father [Music] well he calls me his own he'll never leave me [Music] alone [Music] cause he knows my face and he knows my everything [Music] and tears me when I come and I need more [Music] if you need more of him just lift your hands that's the way it's got to be and I need more all right till there's no room left in me and all those wasted hours and minutes they're yours now from the start to the fittest [Music] amen did you enjoy what you heard tonight it's important to have that Foundation because it stays with you wherever you go throughout life and every decision you make falls back to that Foundation and it's it's a progressive it gets worse and worse if that original platform isn't isn't steady on his word I enjoyed that mosaic Matt I feel closing a word of Prayer powerheads Lord we're so thankful just to be here in your presence yes Lord we don't want to overlook you're still a sweet Spirit Lord because we know you're here Lord I guess even if there's no altar call no shouting I just feel that sweetness I'm so thankful for it Lord help us to recognize you Lord as we're here Lord as we begin to close out this service Lord and as we go and throughout this week would you just be a present Lord with us now and in our lives going forward Lord help us to have our lives on that Foundation we're so thankful Lord be with us as we go Lord bless Brothers Zachary for his labor we love you and thank you Lord for being with us Jesus name amen amen amen don't don't forget the wall says tomorrow at 11. sing that sing again as we go and I need more [Music] of you you are dismissed [Music] that's the way it's got to be [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
