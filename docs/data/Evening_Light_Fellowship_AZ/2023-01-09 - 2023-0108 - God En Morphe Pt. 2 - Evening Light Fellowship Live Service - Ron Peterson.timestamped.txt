[50:08] that you might see the reflection
[50:10] of yourself that little boy when he
[50:13] looked at namir he said that's me Mama
[50:15] amen that's me and when this message
[50:19] came across your path and that Prophet
[50:22] began to preach and talked about
[50:25] predestinated elect seed you said that's
[50:28] me mama
[50:30] you identified yourself in the scripture
[50:33] in fact that's what Jesus did he took
[50:35] the scroll of Isaiah and he found where
[50:37] it was written of him
[50:38] amen and I found one day when it said
[50:41] behold I send unto you Elijah
[50:44] and I found where it was written of me I
[50:47] will send unto yous somebody say that's
[50:50] me

[53:03] um
[53:17] amen thank you musicians let's just
[53:19] remain standing go directly to the word
[53:21] uh we're continuing on with a thought
[53:25] about God in Martha
[53:27] now that's what this message has come to
[53:31] make you to be aware of
[53:33] that you're a part of God you always
[53:35] were a part of God he said every elect
[53:38] seed has been and will always be
[53:43] a part of God
[53:46] that makes you eternal
[53:48] though you came down here took on a
[53:51] flesh body you bypass your theophany but
[53:55] God did all of that for a purpose
[53:58] amen
[54:00] but what he's doing is he's taking you
[54:02] back
[54:05] we're going back
[54:07] to what we were
[54:09] no deposit
[54:10] no return but if you came from God
[54:13] you're going back to God because you
[54:16] know what you're a part of him
[54:19] amen praise the Lord all right
[54:22] I'd like you to turn with me to Psalms
[54:24] 82 and verse 1. then we'll go to
[54:27] Deuteronomy 10.
[54:31] and then we'll go to Psalms 138 and then
[54:34] to First Corinthians 8. and then to
[54:37] Philippians 2.
[54:39] amen yeah we're going to read a little
[54:41] bit this morning
[54:43] Psalms 82 and verse 1. God standeth
[54:47] in the congregation of the mighty
[54:51] he judgeth
[54:53] among the gods
[54:56] that's why he's here
[54:58] and his judgment is righteous
[55:01] he stands here among us today
[55:04] in the form of the revealed word
[55:07] what is he doing he's judging
[55:09] among the gods
[55:12] Deuteronomy 10
[55:14] verse 17.
[55:18] for the Lord your God
[55:21] is the god of Gods
[55:24] and the Lord of lords a great God
[55:28] a mighty and a terrible which regardeth
[55:31] not persons
[55:32] nor taketh reward
[55:36] amen
[55:39] aren't you glad you know that God he is
[55:41] the God of all
[55:43] gods
[55:48] Psalms 138
[55:50] verse 1.
[55:53] I will praise thee with my whole heart
[55:56] before the gods will I sing praise unto
[56:00] thee
[56:01] before the Gods
[56:04] I will sing praise
[56:06] unto thee
[56:09] turn with me now to First Corinthians
[56:11] chapter 8.
[56:16] verses 5 through 6.
[56:22] for though there be
[56:24] that are called gods
[56:28] whether in heaven or in Earth
[56:32] as there be God's many
[56:35] and Lord's many
[56:38] but to us there is but one God
[56:43] the father of whom are all things and we
[56:46] are in him and our Lord Jesus Christ by
[56:50] whom are all things and we
[56:53] by him
[56:54] notice
[56:56] there are many that are called gods
[56:59] whether in heaven or in Earth
[57:03] but for us there is only but one
[57:06] true and living God
[57:09] Philippians
[57:10] 2
[57:12] verses 5 through 8.
[57:19] let this mind be in you which was also
[57:22] in Christ Jesus
[57:25] who being in the form of God
[57:29] thought it not robbery
[57:32] to be equal with God
[57:35] but made of himself no reputation that
[57:38] took upon him the form of a servant
[57:41] and was made in the likeness of man
[57:45] and being found in fashion as a man he
[57:49] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[57:52] death even the death
[57:54] of the Cross may God bless the reading
[57:56] of his word you may be seated this
[57:58] morning in his presence
[58:04] I'd like to title my sermon
[58:09] this is part two
[58:12] and I'd like to take a subject this
[58:14] morning of let this mind be in you
[58:19] now I talk
[58:20] excuse me
[58:24] I told some of you to do homework
[58:28] to look up
[58:30] God in Martha
[58:33] and then we were had the breakfast I
[58:36] said that Sunday morning and Monday
[58:37] morning Scott Schofield sitting next to
[58:40] me said how do you spell in Martha
[58:44] I spelled it
[58:46] he said how come I can't find it
[58:49] did he say it he knew he said it because
[58:52] I said he said it
[58:55] but it was n e n and then Martha
[58:59] so I corrected it this morning God en
[59:04] whatever hyphen morpha
[59:07] and so
[59:10] I trust all of you that did your
[59:12] homework and how can I see the hands of
[59:14] those who do their homework
[59:15] extracurricular yeah we got yeah good
[59:18] give them a star
[59:20] give him a dinner pass
[59:23] and yeah yeah I should do that just
[59:25] passing in because uh that's what
[59:28] happens when you do uh that in whether
[59:31] you're in high school or in college
[59:34] you know a lot of times you'll be given
[59:36] extracurricular activities so that you
[59:38] might study to know a little bit more of
[59:41] what you're looking into amen now we're
[59:45] continuing on uh this morning let's go
[59:48] directly to a quote here in 64 where
[59:50] brother Brandon preaches
[59:53] in the sermon the unveiling of God
[59:57] he said God changed himself changes his
[1:00:00] form
[1:00:01] if you notice here in Philippians he
[1:00:04] said not thinking it robbery but took
[1:00:07] the form of a man
[1:00:10] now the Greek word here for that form
[1:00:12] I'm looking at it all day yesterday
[1:00:14] trying to think out what it was I find
[1:00:18] come with this word
[1:00:20] of inmorpha it's spelled
[1:00:24] en and he spells it looking in the Greek
[1:00:28] I find out what amorpha was
[1:00:31] I may pronounce it wrong but the reason
[1:00:34] I spell it when a tape is released the
[1:00:36] people Scholars will know
[1:00:38] what I meant by it
[1:00:40] when he
[1:00:42] when the inmorpha that means he changed
[1:00:45] himself he he come down now the Greek
[1:00:49] word there means that something that
[1:00:52] could not be seen
[1:00:55] it's there and then it's changed
[1:00:59] so the eye can catch it
[1:01:02] in other words the Invisibles becoming
[1:01:06] visible
[1:01:07] the Supernatural is making itself known
[1:01:11] so God is changing his mask
[1:01:15] I want you to understand that brother
[1:01:17] Brenham talks about how the Bible is
[1:01:20] actually a a book of a great drama
[1:01:25] started in heaven was cast down to earth
[1:01:29] and he says and everybody whether sinner
[1:01:33] or Saint whether seed or non-seed is
[1:01:36] talked about in this drama
[1:01:39] and God is the author
[1:01:43] and he has predestinated some
[1:01:47] unto election
[1:01:49] and he is predestinated some
[1:01:52] unto hell
[1:01:54] I'm sorry but there because
[1:01:58] he is the author and he can make a
[1:02:02] vessel of Honor
[1:02:04] or a vessel Of Dishonor
[1:02:07] so the clay can never tell the Potter
[1:02:10] why is Thou made me thus
[1:02:13] for hath not the Potter power over the
[1:02:16] clay
[1:02:17] so we understand that there are some
[1:02:20] that will never come to the
[1:02:23] enlightenment never know God because
[1:02:25] they are carnally minded
[1:02:28] and it's enmity with God
[1:02:32] but God changing his mask all down
[1:02:35] through time
[1:02:37] now watch this so that you understand a
[1:02:40] little bit of
[1:02:41] the thought that I'm thinking about
[1:02:44] that brother Brenham says now watch God
[1:02:47] who is the God above us Jehovah God who
[1:02:49] is the spirit
[1:02:51] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:02:53] Him in spirit and Truth
[1:02:55] but a God who is invisible who is
[1:03:00] hard to understand
[1:03:03] has got to make himself known in a way
[1:03:06] that we as human beings could have a
[1:03:10] mental capacity to understand a little
[1:03:13] bit about God
[1:03:15] so it was God above us
[1:03:17] and brother Brown said there he was
[1:03:19] great Jehovah God a God who spanned all
[1:03:22] eternity all uh eons and eons of time
[1:03:25] and he being great Jehovah God could not
[1:03:28] make himself known
[1:03:30] as great Jehovah God he's too great your
[1:03:34] little Minds could not conceive it your
[1:03:36] hard drive would lock up you would have
[1:03:39] to have an update
[1:03:42] you'd have to have something that God
[1:03:44] could allow you to catch that that's why
[1:03:48] let this mind
[1:03:51] that was in Christ be in you also
[1:03:56] it is a battle of the Mind the greatest
[1:03:58] battle ever fought is in the mind
[1:04:02] so God
[1:04:05] is changing his mask
[1:04:08] all down through time
[1:04:11] in the Book of Genesis
[1:04:13] we find out that God is acting out a
[1:04:17] part of his Plan of Redemption
[1:04:21] in Adam and Eve
[1:04:25] in Abel and in Seth what is it God
[1:04:30] changing his mask
[1:04:33] and each one of them have got to play
[1:04:36] their part that was written of them
[1:04:41] in that age
[1:04:43] in that time now the phrase the word of
[1:04:47] the Lord
[1:04:49] is used 257 times in your Bible
[1:04:55] I looked it up in Hebrew
[1:04:57] it says Jehovah
[1:05:01] it means the spokesman of Jehovah
[1:05:06] and brother Branham said that the voice
[1:05:08] of God spoke through the prophets
[1:05:11] because prophets were known to be the
[1:05:14] mouthpiece of God
[1:05:17] and he said when they came under that
[1:05:20] anointing and they spoke
[1:05:23] it was not the prophet speaking although
[1:05:27] it was his voice
[1:05:29] that they could say thus saith the Lord
[1:05:34] because they were speaking under the
[1:05:37] anointing they were speaking under
[1:05:40] divine inspiration therefore they could
[1:05:43] say thus saith the Lord
[1:05:46] and they always spoke in first person
[1:05:49] singular
[1:05:51] no wonder when God speaks a prophecy
[1:05:55] he speaks always in first person
[1:05:57] singular hear ye my people for I the
[1:06:01] Lord I Will Bless Thee I will do this I
[1:06:04] will do that
[1:06:07] we understand then that even we must
[1:06:12] when we have Prophecies of the end time
[1:06:14] of what God will do in this end time to
[1:06:18] fulfill his word
[1:06:20] a lot of times people say well this
[1:06:22] one's got to fulfill that this one's got
[1:06:24] to fulfill that
[1:06:26] and understand that God fulfills his
[1:06:29] word by bringing it to pass
[1:06:32] God is his own interpreter
[1:06:35] many times people will say well it's got
[1:06:39] to be brother Branham to do this I will
[1:06:41] ride this Trail one more time
[1:06:43] well he actually says it's three ways I
[1:06:46] ask you which way is correct
[1:06:49] he says I will ride this Trail one more
[1:06:51] she will ride or we will ride which way
[1:06:55] is it
[1:06:56] listen when he's speaking on under
[1:06:59] inspiration remember it's a promise
[1:07:02] and so therefore if it's a prophetic
[1:07:04] word what you have to do is let God
[1:07:07] fulfill it himself
[1:07:11] if you're not careful what happens is
[1:07:13] you
[1:07:14] you make God have to do things the way
[1:07:17] to your understanding
[1:07:21] and God never has been Limited
[1:07:23] to fulfilling his word according to our
[1:07:26] understanding
[1:07:27] because many times he can say something
[1:07:30] and they don't catch it
[1:07:31] destroy this temple in three days I'll
[1:07:34] raise it up they thought it meant a
[1:07:36] physical Temple
[1:07:37] but after his resurrection they caught
[1:07:40] the understanding oh he meant the Temple
[1:07:41] of his body
[1:07:46] brother Brown said when divine
[1:07:48] inspiration comes upon mortal lips
[1:07:52] and is spoken it becomes as omnipotent
[1:07:56] speaking
[1:07:57] he said it's the same as God speaking
[1:08:02] that's an amazing
[1:08:05] thing when you think about that now
[1:08:07] brother Branham in the sermon the Mighty
[1:08:09] God unveiled before us 1964.
[1:08:13] um
[1:08:14] he says in Joel 2 28 he promised in
[1:08:18] these last days there would be a latter
[1:08:20] rain poured out upon the people in the
[1:08:23] last days I think the Greek word there
[1:08:25] is kinos which means he emptied his self
[1:08:28] out not in the way he would say like
[1:08:31] something was inside of somebody that he
[1:08:33] emptied out but he poured himself out he
[1:08:37] changed he is in Martha he changed from
[1:08:41] what he was to what he is
[1:08:43] he never changes his nature
[1:08:47] but on the day of Pentecost he changed
[1:08:50] himself from being the son of man to the
[1:08:54] son of God
[1:08:55] he came not with the people
[1:09:00] he came in the people see the same God
[1:09:05] carry on his ministry on through in this
[1:09:08] great age what was God doing on a day of
[1:09:11] Pentecost he went from one
[1:09:14] to a many member
[1:09:17] same works that I do shall you do also
[1:09:19] yes
[1:09:21] even Greater Works shall you do than I
[1:09:24] have done
[1:09:27] amen God changing in Martha
[1:09:33] now in Hebrew It also says
[1:09:36] as I said 237 times in the word of the
[1:09:39] Lord came
[1:09:41] when I looked it up
[1:09:43] and you see all of those examples
[1:09:46] you actually will take that Hebrew form
[1:09:49] and you'll see that it says and the word
[1:09:53] became the word of the Lord became
[1:09:55] Jeremiah
[1:10:00] in other words the flesh took on a
[1:10:03] supernatural quality
[1:10:09] Now understand that God came down he was
[1:10:12] the logos of God
[1:10:14] he was the word in the beginning was the
[1:10:16] word and the Word was God and the Word
[1:10:18] was with God and the word became flesh
[1:10:21] and dwelt Among Us
[1:10:23] now we bypassed all that didn't we we
[1:10:26] came down here without our theophany we
[1:10:29] didn't have all of our understanding as
[1:10:32] he did
[1:10:33] and he says but you having an elect seed
[1:10:37] inside of you
[1:10:39] he said there will come a time when you
[1:10:42] will hear the word and when the word is
[1:10:45] heard by the hearing of the ear it will
[1:10:48] Quicken
[1:10:50] it will germanize that elect seed inside
[1:10:54] of you and it takes life
[1:10:56] Hallelujah because Jesus said my words
[1:10:59] are Spirit
[1:11:01] and they are life
[1:11:07] so the word of the Lord became in
[1:11:11] Jeremiah
[1:11:14] and
[1:11:15] the word of the Lord
[1:11:18] became Abraham
[1:11:21] the word of the Lord
[1:11:23] became David
[1:11:26] and each one had a portion
[1:11:30] they had only a small portion of a great
[1:11:33] drama
[1:11:35] I want all of you to know that you play
[1:11:37] a part in this end time of laudia SIA
[1:11:40] and God wants you to play your part and
[1:11:43] play it well because we have a part to
[1:11:45] play every one of you
[1:11:48] and may I say this that everyone on
[1:11:50] terra firma everyone here on Earth has a
[1:11:54] part to play
[1:11:55] and the reason that they out there are
[1:11:57] playing their part very well is because
[1:11:59] they're coming under the inspiration of
[1:12:03] the mark of the beast and the image that
[1:12:05] is being made in this end time and why
[1:12:07] they can all talk in one Unison is
[1:12:10] because the God of this world is
[1:12:13] blinding their minds and he is inspiring
[1:12:17] them through the media through all of
[1:12:19] the television through all of the songs
[1:12:22] and everything he is bombarding their
[1:12:25] mind of letting them know that he is
[1:12:28] their father and his Works they
[1:12:32] we'll do
[1:12:33] that's why the people are going crazy
[1:12:37] that's why the killings the murders the
[1:12:41] rape and all of this let me tell you
[1:12:43] this is Satan's eaten
[1:12:47] but right in the midst of Satan's Eden
[1:12:51] God has prepared a people hallelujah
[1:12:55] that is going to receive a word and God
[1:12:59] is going to end Marfa himself in them
[1:13:09] and he identified Christ of all ages
[1:13:12] brother Branham said
[1:13:14] remember God changes his form in Martha
[1:13:21] the Greek word means to put on a
[1:13:23] different mask
[1:13:26] he talks about Shakespeare's play
[1:13:29] he's like an actor he changes his form
[1:13:34] all what those prophets were
[1:13:37] that was God in those Prophets
[1:13:40] Jesus said so you call them gods
[1:13:44] who the word of God came to
[1:13:47] and here I am the Son of God how do you
[1:13:50] condemn me
[1:13:53] same thing as today
[1:13:55] it's God manifested in flesh the message
[1:13:59] of the hour the light of the day
[1:14:02] he can't have them other messages back
[1:14:05] there they have done lived up
[1:14:09] we live in the glare of a light now he
[1:14:11] says don't live in the glare of another
[1:14:13] age
[1:14:14] he said they played their part they
[1:14:16] lived their part what about you and I in
[1:14:20] this end time we have a part to play
[1:14:22] that's why God sent a messenger he is to
[1:14:25] let you know you have a part to play and
[1:14:29] it's not you playing the part it is God
[1:14:32] in you it is God performing his word it
[1:14:36] is God living out a life of
[1:14:39] righteousness it's not your works it's
[1:14:42] your faith being made manifest and the
[1:14:44] faith you have is not your own
[1:14:47] it is a gift of God
[1:14:55] it's not you any longer that's living
[1:15:00] why you've been crucified
[1:15:06] it's the anointing of Christ that's
[1:15:08] living in you
[1:15:09] acting out your part and Lydia Sia
[1:15:16] Galatians 2 verses 16 through 21 knowing
[1:15:19] that a man is not justified by The Works
[1:15:21] of the law
[1:15:23] but by the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:15:27] even we have believed in Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] that we might be justified by the Faith
[1:15:34] of Christ and not by The Works of the
[1:15:37] law for the works of the law shall no
[1:15:39] flesh be justified
[1:15:43] but if while we seek to be justified by
[1:15:46] Christ we ourselves also are found
[1:15:49] sinners
[1:15:50] is therefore Christ and minister of sin
[1:15:53] God forbid
[1:15:55] but if I build again the things I which
[1:15:58] I destroyed and make myself a just a
[1:16:01] transgressor
[1:16:04] for through the law I'm dead to the law
[1:16:07] that I might live unto God I am
[1:16:08] crucified with Christ
[1:16:11] nevertheless I live
[1:16:14] yet not I
[1:16:16] wait a second you're dead yet you're
[1:16:18] alive
[1:16:20] nevertheless I live yet not I
[1:16:23] but Christ the anointed word hallelujah
[1:16:27] the revealed word the third pull liveth
[1:16:31] in me in the life I now live in the
[1:16:33] flesh
[1:16:34] I'd live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:16:37] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:16:40] somebody say Amen
[1:16:44] I do not frustrate the grace of God
[1:16:47] for if righteousness came by the law
[1:16:51] then Christ is dead in vain
[1:16:54] it is a gift of God faith is a gift that
[1:16:58] God gives you every man is given a
[1:17:00] Measure of Faith
[1:17:03] it is that faith in God
[1:17:05] that justifies you in the sight of God
[1:17:09] it is not your works it is not how good
[1:17:13] you can live this message
[1:17:17] because no matter how much you try to
[1:17:20] say
[1:17:21] I can live it living according to the
[1:17:25] law and the letter of the law every one
[1:17:27] of you shall be found guilty because if
[1:17:31] you have transgressed the least
[1:17:34] you have transgressed all
[1:17:36] therefore
[1:17:38] our righteousness becomes as filthy rags
[1:17:42] therefore we must not have our
[1:17:45] righteousness we must have the
[1:17:47] righteousness what is given to us by
[1:17:49] faith which is a revelation and the
[1:17:52] Revelation you didn't get it to you by
[1:17:54] some preacher you didn't get it from the
[1:17:57] prophet you didn't get it from somebody
[1:17:59] in the church you didn't get it from one
[1:18:01] another you got it from God himself
[1:18:04] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:18:10] revelation
[1:18:12] is faith
[1:18:14] and faith is a gift
[1:18:19] you who he hath predestinated to receive
[1:18:23] this grace
[1:18:27] before the foundation of the world the
[1:18:29] prophet said
[1:18:30] he put a ring upon your finger of
[1:18:33] unmerited favor
[1:18:36] that means you were engaged
[1:18:39] before you knew it
[1:18:43] he had already placed Grace upon you
[1:18:45] before the foundation of the world and
[1:18:47] he knew you would come down here in this
[1:18:50] age and he knew your nature he knew
[1:18:52] everything about you he knew your mom
[1:18:54] and daddy knew what church you'd go to
[1:18:55] he knew all the things that you would go
[1:18:57] through and he predestinated You by
[1:19:00] grace
[1:19:05] Measure of Faith is given in every one
[1:19:08] of you
[1:19:10] that you might live the life
[1:19:13] of Christ Living outside of you
[1:19:16] that's why God gives you a revelation it
[1:19:18] is not the dress that makes you holy
[1:19:21] it's the revelation of God's word then
[1:19:24] when it's revealed to you
[1:19:27] and then you do it and you manifest God
[1:19:30] says that's righteousness
[1:19:33] do you understand that
[1:19:35] it's not long here
[1:19:37] on the woman that makes her righteous
[1:19:39] it's the Revelation she should not cut
[1:19:42] her hair because does not nature itself
[1:19:45] teach you
[1:19:49] so once she catches the Revelation and
[1:19:52] she lives it and applies it God says
[1:19:55] that's righteousness
[1:19:59] it is not by your works
[1:20:01] It Is by your faith
[1:20:04] be but your faith will have Works
[1:20:06] expressed
[1:20:08] because if you say you have faith and I
[1:20:11] don't see works
[1:20:14] it doesn't add up
[1:20:16] you say you believe the word of God and
[1:20:18] I don't see the word of God manifesting
[1:20:20] itself in your life brother Brenham says
[1:20:23] now I don't care how much you speak in
[1:20:26] tongues dance in the spirit have the
[1:20:28] gifts of the Spirit activate the spirit
[1:20:30] all of that he says until I see the life
[1:20:34] he says can you imagine you telling me
[1:20:37] you got the Holy Ghost and you still cut
[1:20:39] your hair
[1:20:40] you wearing moral clothes he said let me
[1:20:43] tell you the Holy Ghost has got to say
[1:20:45] Amen to every word and if your life is
[1:20:49] not saying or manifesting and amen on
[1:20:53] every bit of God's word it's not the
[1:20:55] Holy Ghost
[1:20:59] can't be
[1:21:00] he said because it will always say amen
[1:21:05] and manifest the word
[1:21:11] you can keep the law
[1:21:15] and you can keep from breaking
[1:21:17] ordinances and Commandments
[1:21:20] you can go to church and you can worship
[1:21:23] God
[1:21:24] but without Revelation it's vain worship
[1:21:31] when we look at Saul the Pharisee on his
[1:21:34] road to Damascus
[1:21:36] it's exactly what he was
[1:21:39] he was a religious zealot
[1:21:43] for God
[1:21:47] Philippians 3 verses 3 through 9 it says
[1:21:51] for we are the circumcision
[1:21:54] which worship God in the spirit and
[1:21:56] rejoicing Christ Jesus
[1:21:58] and have no confidence in the flesh
[1:22:02] though I might also have confidence in
[1:22:05] the flesh
[1:22:07] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[1:22:09] wherefore
[1:22:11] that he might Trust In the Flesh I more
[1:22:15] watch him brag here for a moment
[1:22:18] circumcised The Eighth Day
[1:22:21] of the stalk of Israel
[1:22:24] of The Tribe of Benjamin he's taken its
[1:22:27] genealogy
[1:22:28] he's going back I was circumcised
[1:22:30] according to the law I was of The Tribe
[1:22:34] of Benjamin
[1:22:36] and Hebrew
[1:22:38] of Hebrews is touching the law of
[1:22:42] Pharisee
[1:22:44] concerning Zeal persecuting the church
[1:22:48] touching righteousness which is in the
[1:22:50] law
[1:22:52] that's listen
[1:22:55] I don't see many people could ever boast
[1:22:57] that kind of boast
[1:23:00] but what things were gained to me
[1:23:03] those I counted lost for Christ
[1:23:07] yea Dallas I count all things but lost
[1:23:10] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[1:23:12] Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:23:14] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:23:17] things and to count them but dung that I
[1:23:20] might win Christ
[1:23:21] Hallelujah
[1:23:24] and be found in him having not my own
[1:23:26] righteousness
[1:23:28] which is of the law
[1:23:30] but that which is through the Faith of
[1:23:32] Christ
[1:23:33] the righteousness which is of god
[1:23:37] by faith
[1:23:40] for the Justified believers
[1:23:43] shall live by faith what is Faith
[1:23:45] revelation
[1:23:48] we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:23:52] if we're not careful we teach
[1:23:55] the message
[1:23:57] and people conform to its teaching and
[1:24:01] our children sometimes are victims of
[1:24:03] this
[1:24:05] you expect them to have the same
[1:24:08] Revelation you have Mom and Dad because
[1:24:10] quote they were raised in a mess each
[1:24:13] home many young people today within the
[1:24:16] message feel
[1:24:18] that they are victims
[1:24:20] that they have had no choice in the
[1:24:23] matter
[1:24:24] and in one way that is true
[1:24:27] because the parents are the god to the
[1:24:30] children until the children get old
[1:24:32] enough
[1:24:34] that they can go and do their own thing
[1:24:36] but while you're in my house
[1:24:41] Joshua said for me and my house
[1:24:44] we'll serve the Lord
[1:24:46] now they're your offspring
[1:24:48] and there'll come a time when they may
[1:24:50] spring off
[1:24:52] and they think they're big and they want
[1:24:54] to do their own thing and yeah I don't
[1:24:56] want to go to church I don't want to do
[1:24:58] this and I have tried to conform to it
[1:25:01] and then like the prodigal brother
[1:25:04] random said there are many elect seed to
[1:25:07] go through a hard time and identity
[1:25:09] crisis who am I
[1:25:12] man what is this message all about all
[1:25:14] of these rules regulations and do's and
[1:25:17] don'ts and and and it wasn't my decision
[1:25:21] so God says fine go ahead eat with the
[1:25:24] pigs
[1:25:28] get out there and you act like one of
[1:25:31] them get to getting around and doing
[1:25:32] what they do and you realize oh my I
[1:25:35] don't belong here
[1:25:38] and the Bible says
[1:25:40] and he came to himself I want to ask you
[1:25:42] what came to me
[1:25:46] see he had an epiphany
[1:25:49] he was hearing from his theophany you
[1:25:52] don't belong here
[1:25:54] huh yeah well and the Bible says and
[1:25:58] while he was yet afar off in his
[1:26:00] father's side
[1:26:02] and he began to rejoice and he said kill
[1:26:05] a fatted calf get the ring get the Rope
[1:26:08] let me tell you the moment
[1:26:11] Hallelujah that he neglect seed come to
[1:26:14] themselves God in heaven is already
[1:26:17] rejoicing why you're on your way
[1:26:20] oh yeah you might be a far off and I'll
[1:26:24] tell you what if you backslid and you
[1:26:25] went out of the world you'll have a hard
[1:26:27] time it'd be a hard time crawling out of
[1:26:30] that hole
[1:26:31] because sin has a way of holding you
[1:26:34] longer than you want to be held
[1:26:37] yet God makes a way
[1:26:43] you and I should have more interest in
[1:26:45] the things that we do not see than the
[1:26:47] things that we see
[1:26:50] we should be like Abraham who
[1:26:53] sought for a city whose Builder and
[1:26:55] maker is God
[1:26:59] now Jesus came in three offices son of
[1:27:02] man Son of God Son of David
[1:27:06] in the sermon unveiling of God follow
[1:27:08] along
[1:27:09] he came first as a prophet and they
[1:27:11] crucified him
[1:27:13] his own crucified him he came as the son
[1:27:16] of man because Jesus kept asking who do
[1:27:19] they say that I the son of man am
[1:27:23] many of them said well Thou Art Jeremiah
[1:27:26] or one of the prophets raised up see
[1:27:29] return Ministry is not something new
[1:27:34] it was back then
[1:27:36] oh well it must be a return of a
[1:27:38] Ministry of a prophet to come back but
[1:27:41] then he said but who do you
[1:27:45] you see my brother my sister it must be
[1:27:48] a revelation to you
[1:27:50] about this message
[1:27:54] you're not going to get it because you
[1:27:56] were raised around it
[1:27:58] you're not going to get it because you
[1:28:00] went to a message Church
[1:28:02] and you sat there and you heard the word
[1:28:04] but it
[1:28:06] had no effect upon you
[1:28:09] now I look at Jacob as an elect seed who
[1:28:12] is in an identity crisis
[1:28:15] he couldn't have been born in a more
[1:28:17] Godly family
[1:28:20] why Abraham his grandfather and Isaac
[1:28:23] his father
[1:28:24] no doubt he sat in home meetings all the
[1:28:28] time and they explained all of the
[1:28:31] things why Abraham's talked about so
[1:28:34] many things of him having met
[1:28:36] Melchizedek and on and on and the great
[1:28:39] times that God spoke to him and Isaac
[1:28:42] said yes even as my father persevered
[1:28:45] and after 25 years and his body as good
[1:28:48] as dead and then here I come and all of
[1:28:51] the things and Jacob's still ah who am I
[1:28:57] but Jacob see House of God experiences
[1:29:00] never change him
[1:29:03] remember that one time he had a vision
[1:29:06] of sawing Angels ascending and
[1:29:08] descending
[1:29:10] didn't change his life
[1:29:12] visions and Supernatural things may
[1:29:16] anoint you and he says why God is in
[1:29:19] this place and I didn't know it and he
[1:29:21] named the place Bethel
[1:29:24] House of God many people have House of
[1:29:27] God experiences they feel anointings and
[1:29:30] are never changed
[1:29:35] but Jacob came to a place called pineal
[1:29:39] where I met God
[1:29:42] face to face
[1:29:44] let me say this to everyone here and I
[1:29:46] trust that each one of you have had your
[1:29:48] penial experience
[1:29:51] where you
[1:29:53] wrestle with God
[1:29:56] you want a blessing you ain't get it
[1:29:58] because Mom and Dad got it
[1:30:00] you ain't getting it because the pastor
[1:30:01] got it you ain't getting it because the
[1:30:03] prophet got it
[1:30:04] you're getting it when you wrestle and
[1:30:07] let me tell you if you want to be
[1:30:09] blessed you're going to have to wrestle
[1:30:10] with it
[1:30:11] you're gonna have to wrestle with the
[1:30:13] angel of Malachi 4 Revelations 10 and
[1:30:17] say bless me
[1:30:20] you got to hang on and you got to fight
[1:30:21] for life because you're fighting for
[1:30:23] your identity
[1:30:29] your name is Jacob
[1:30:33] he said because you have done this today
[1:30:35] I'm going to change your name it's no
[1:30:37] longer Jacob it's Israel
[1:30:41] because thou art a prince with God
[1:30:45] and the evidence of him having wrestle
[1:30:49] with the angel
[1:30:55] his walk
[1:30:57] reflected
[1:30:59] do you understand
[1:31:01] let me see your walk change after you
[1:31:05] have wrestled with God after you have
[1:31:07] come to the altar after you have come to
[1:31:09] that altar in your heart and you said oh
[1:31:12] God I need you to reveal yourself to me
[1:31:15] it's not what Mom and Dad believe it's
[1:31:18] not what the pastor or the prophet or
[1:31:20] anyone else I need to know for myself
[1:31:26] and when you get under that kind of an
[1:31:28] unani and you ask God God will show you
[1:31:31] until then he don't play for nobody
[1:31:34] sit there with bad attitudes
[1:31:37] well I'll tell you what
[1:31:40] I watch young people and I see it
[1:31:43] I see young people that struggle
[1:31:46] and I say you know what
[1:31:48] God help them
[1:31:50] that they come to that place where they
[1:31:52] wrestle with God
[1:31:54] until then
[1:31:56] they got a drug problem
[1:31:58] they're drug to church
[1:32:02] they're drug to meetings
[1:32:05] okay
[1:32:06] they don't want to be there
[1:32:10] so
[1:32:11] I'll come a time
[1:32:13] you're old enough you don't want to be
[1:32:15] there you won't
[1:32:17] you want to go out be your own man your
[1:32:18] own woman nobody tell me
[1:32:24] yeah
[1:32:25] okay
[1:32:27] my own daughter told me one time
[1:32:30] this is personal it's a window into my
[1:32:32] heart
[1:32:34] my own daughter said Daddy don't you
[1:32:36] ever tell me what to do the rest of my
[1:32:38] life
[1:32:43] I said look me in the eye
[1:32:47] I said sis from now on I'll never tell
[1:32:50] you
[1:32:51] what you need to do the rest of your
[1:32:52] life
[1:32:55] I said you got to find it out yourself
[1:32:58] and boy it's tough for a daddy to do
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] because you know what you want to
[1:33:03] correct the problem
[1:33:05] I remember even we had a family reunion
[1:33:09] and she came
[1:33:12] and her hair was jet black
[1:33:16] I looked at her and I
[1:33:18] a little bit embarrassed
[1:33:20] I said I waited until
[1:33:23] grandkids everybody else got in the
[1:33:25] house
[1:33:27] we're out on the front porch and I said
[1:33:29] do you mind if I tell you something
[1:33:32] she said no Daddy go ahead
[1:33:34] I said you look cheap
[1:33:40] I said you look Gothic
[1:33:43] black
[1:33:46] and I said
[1:33:48] that's it that's all I had to say
[1:33:53] well it's my Nat I said ain't your
[1:33:55] natural hair color
[1:33:56] I'm your daddy
[1:33:58] I know what natural hair color
[1:34:01] so now I I said dad but I said it by
[1:34:04] permission guess what next time I saw
[1:34:06] her hair wasn't jet black
[1:34:08] and I thought uh-huh
[1:34:13] you see
[1:34:15] you can bring a horse to water but you
[1:34:18] can't make them drink
[1:34:20] but when they get thirsty they'll drink
[1:34:23] I don't know if any of you have ever
[1:34:25] rode a horse that's thirsty
[1:34:27] and you bring them over to the Corral
[1:34:29] and to The Watering Place over there and
[1:34:32] they stick their muzzle down into that
[1:34:34] and they start sucking up water
[1:34:37] but if they ain't thirsty you can press
[1:34:39] that you can Splash their face you can
[1:34:41] put it right there on their lips and
[1:34:44] they won't drink but when they're
[1:34:45] thirsty
[1:34:46] so it is with people
[1:34:49] they that hunger and thirst after
[1:34:52] righteousness
[1:34:53] they shall be filled
[1:35:00] now the unveiling of God I read the
[1:35:03] first part we're going to paragraph 69.
[1:35:05] then after the Holy Spirit came then he
[1:35:07] was the son of God God is the spirit
[1:35:10] he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he
[1:35:12] lived through the church ages as Son of
[1:35:15] God
[1:35:15] now in the Millennium he'll be the son
[1:35:17] of David sitting on the throne of his
[1:35:19] father David he is the son of David now
[1:35:21] now remember between the Son of God in
[1:35:24] the laodicean church age they put him
[1:35:26] out
[1:35:28] and in Luke he said he would be revealed
[1:35:31] again as the son of man the prophet
[1:35:33] fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures
[1:35:36] type perfectly together son of man Son
[1:35:39] of God Son of David what was it it's the
[1:35:42] same God all the time just changing his
[1:35:45] form and Marfa he just changed it it's a
[1:35:50] great drama to him
[1:35:52] he is acting it out let me take that a
[1:35:57] little further he is acting out the
[1:36:01] drama in laudiusia in your life it's not
[1:36:05] you that's doing it
[1:36:08] he's doing it
[1:36:15] now let me just say when you take a
[1:36:18] overview
[1:36:20] of the Bible
[1:36:23] there is a central theme in that Bible
[1:36:27] and the whole theme
[1:36:30] is redemption and restoration
[1:36:35] he shows the fall in Genesis
[1:36:38] he shows the drama from genus all the
[1:36:41] way to revelation
[1:36:43] shows the tree of life is guarded they
[1:36:47] are taken in everything that Adam lost
[1:36:50] the second Adam returns back
[1:36:56] redeem means to purchase back
[1:37:00] to pay the price of redemption
[1:37:04] restores to bring back to its original
[1:37:06] creation so in order for you and I to
[1:37:09] understand what were we like
[1:37:13] in our origin
[1:37:16] as Adam was
[1:37:18] so then we go back to Adam before the
[1:37:20] fall
[1:37:23] Adam was a God in the garden
[1:37:28] said great Jehovah God was the god of
[1:37:31] the universe but he says Adam was placed
[1:37:34] as a God over the garden
[1:37:38] he could speak he'd create
[1:37:42] he was a god
[1:37:45] he was not now listen to me he was not
[1:37:48] the ruler of the whole Earth
[1:37:51] he was the god of the garden
[1:37:53] because the Earth had already
[1:37:56] Satan had already been cast down
[1:37:59] and he was the prince in power he was
[1:38:02] the ruler he was the God of this world
[1:38:07] because the battle started in heaven
[1:38:09] it was cast down to earth and he said
[1:38:12] what was an Angelic bottle has been cast
[1:38:16] down to this Dimension and now it
[1:38:20] becomes a battle among Mortals
[1:38:27] now
[1:38:31] since the fall in the garden his elect
[1:38:33] seed lost their god-like status is that
[1:38:36] true
[1:38:37] they lost their position
[1:38:40] and place in the garden they were cast
[1:38:42] out of Eden
[1:38:44] they'd lost their inheritance
[1:38:48] they lost the right to eat in the tree
[1:38:50] of life and cherubim's now guarded lest
[1:38:53] they each of the tree of life now and
[1:38:55] live forever
[1:38:57] in a unclean condition
[1:39:01] they lost eternal life it came mortal
[1:39:03] beings because the because God had told
[1:39:07] Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof
[1:39:11] is the day you die
[1:39:15] and God is Not
[1:39:18] a threatening repeating parent
[1:39:24] he says at one time
[1:39:27] that's it
[1:39:30] you see we're if we're not careful what
[1:39:32] we do
[1:39:34] your children train you instead of you
[1:39:36] training up the child
[1:39:40] don't get out of bed
[1:39:42] that's it you go in and go to bed don't
[1:39:45] you dare get out of bed
[1:39:46] if you do you're going to get a weapon
[1:39:49] five minutes later jump out of bed come
[1:39:51] in here Mommy Mommy I need a glass of
[1:39:53] water I told you to stay back okay go
[1:39:55] get your water will you get out of bed
[1:39:57] again I'll tell you what now you're
[1:39:58] gonna get it you're gonna get a whipping
[1:40:01] and how many times do they transgress so
[1:40:03] what you just said
[1:40:05] and you make yourself a liar
[1:40:09] and they got you figured out
[1:40:13] they ain't never getting a whipping
[1:40:18] that God ain't that way he said the day
[1:40:20] you eat thereof
[1:40:23] the day you die you got it don't you
[1:40:26] dare eat of the tree
[1:40:28] of knowledge because the day that you
[1:40:32] eat thereof is the day you die
[1:40:37] got that
[1:40:39] for stay stew comprendi
[1:40:45] yeah yeah I got it
[1:40:48] he's not like you and I
[1:40:51] God is a man who keeps his word
[1:40:55] now
[1:40:58] brother Ram says in Christ is the
[1:41:00] mystery of God revealed
[1:41:03] notice making it known
[1:41:06] my there's just so much here we could
[1:41:09] just keep on going notice a tree of
[1:41:11] Christ's body in the garden making his
[1:41:14] mystery known
[1:41:16] to his bride to this Bright Tree watch
[1:41:18] redeem by Christ the second Adam
[1:41:21] you believe he was
[1:41:23] going back home to Eden with his Fallen
[1:41:25] wife redeemed back home again that's
[1:41:28] Christ and the church today look at that
[1:41:31] Christ in the church today what's he
[1:41:33] doing
[1:41:34] taking a redeemed woman
[1:41:37] justify taking her back but back where
[1:41:40] Eden
[1:41:42] taking his wife back see the threefold
[1:41:44] mystery
[1:41:46] God manifested in Christ Christ
[1:41:48] manifested in the church all together
[1:41:51] bring back the original Adam and Eve
[1:41:53] again man and woman which are one made
[1:41:56] out of the same blood Same Spirit and
[1:41:58] everything else
[1:42:01] next quote paragraph 442 making his
[1:42:04] mystery known to his Bright Tree
[1:42:06] Redeemed by Christ the second m going
[1:42:09] back home to the restored back to the
[1:42:11] original Eden free from Death sickness
[1:42:14] sorrow shame going back with eternal
[1:42:17] life
[1:42:20] there is something mysterious that is
[1:42:22] happening to the bride of Christ right
[1:42:24] now universally around the world
[1:42:28] you can
[1:42:30] see this by looking at a cross-section
[1:42:32] of what is being ministered by the
[1:42:36] ministry throughout the world
[1:42:38] the orchestration is not
[1:42:42] a person
[1:42:44] we have no headquarters
[1:42:47] listen my brother my sister
[1:42:50] Jeffersonville
[1:42:52] is not my Mecca
[1:42:58] I don't look for them
[1:43:01] for inspiration I Look to God for
[1:43:04] inspiration
[1:43:07] now
[1:43:08] I know there are some that say Hey you
[1:43:10] know you got to press play and Obey and
[1:43:12] all that kind of stuff well I believe in
[1:43:15] listening to tapes so tapes don't
[1:43:16] replace going to church
[1:43:22] now you guys know I'm a fanatic
[1:43:27] for telling you you listen those tapes
[1:43:29] at home
[1:43:30] so that when I preach here in the pulpit
[1:43:35] ah you would have the discernment where
[1:43:38] did he say that
[1:43:42] tell me all right is this some kind of
[1:43:44] thing you just drummed up in your mind
[1:43:47] huh I wish more
[1:43:51] congregations
[1:43:53] would have the boldness to ask the
[1:43:57] ministry where'd you get that
[1:44:00] excuse me
[1:44:02] are you adding two or taken away from
[1:44:06] well here's my opinion listen when it's
[1:44:08] my opinion I'll tell you my opinion
[1:44:11] the Apostle Paul said it
[1:44:14] this is not I excuse me this is not the
[1:44:17] Lord this is I
[1:44:19] brother random gave us his opinion on
[1:44:21] several things right
[1:44:24] somebody asked him about woman's pajamas
[1:44:26] you know with the feet in them and the
[1:44:28] pants and that sort of thing uh is it
[1:44:31] okay for a woman to wear pajamas
[1:44:33] he said am I reading that right
[1:44:37] my goodness well here's my opinion
[1:44:41] he says I think you look better in a
[1:44:43] night kill
[1:44:45] I'll take his opinion
[1:44:47] okay now if you want to wear your
[1:44:49] pajamas go ahead you understand
[1:44:53] it's a it was his opinion
[1:44:56] now
[1:44:59] the message is taking on right now a
[1:45:02] different Outlook than it's ever took on
[1:45:04] before
[1:45:06] he says now why wouldn't they understand
[1:45:09] these things
[1:45:12] why wouldn't they catch these things
[1:45:15] huh he said God would not permit it to
[1:45:18] be done now
[1:45:20] but one day after I'm gone you begin to
[1:45:22] catch those things and see those things
[1:45:25] is that right
[1:45:27] he said you young men you'll begin to
[1:45:28] catch these things
[1:45:30] brother manno years ago I was one of the
[1:45:32] young men now you're an older man than
[1:45:34] me and you you're you're Ancient of Days
[1:45:40] I remember you using a quote like that
[1:45:43] while you young men will begin to catch
[1:45:45] that and you said brother Ron that's me
[1:45:47] well now you're not the young man
[1:45:49] anymore and then I took my turn and said
[1:45:53] that's me
[1:45:56] now there's other ones coming up behind
[1:45:59] me and saying no that's me
[1:46:01] because they're beginning to catch the
[1:46:04] revelation of what God is doing in this
[1:46:06] hour
[1:46:09] begin to catch a reflection of who they
[1:46:11] are
[1:46:18] you can see it among the ministry around
[1:46:20] the world
[1:46:21] it is not the orchestration of a man
[1:46:24] it is the orchestration of God because
[1:46:26] by one spirit
[1:46:29] we're baptized into one body right
[1:46:34] and this elect seed is beginning to
[1:46:37] understand the end time seed sign
[1:46:42] because the message was sent from God
[1:46:45] now it used to be that years ago
[1:46:50] and some of you Old-Timers you'll know
[1:46:52] this years ago you got everybody to
[1:46:54] Rejoice all you had to do was mention
[1:46:58] Revelation 10 7
[1:47:00] Hallelujah my praise God Revelations 10
[1:47:04] 7 Malachi 4 God sent a prophet
[1:47:07] Hallelujah
[1:47:09] well then we went beyond just looking at
[1:47:12] the sign
[1:47:13] because the sign is Good Wonderful
[1:47:16] Phoenix 20 miles
[1:47:18] but when you have a sign and you read
[1:47:21] Phoenix 20 miles you don't stop and say
[1:47:23] oh great sign thank you what a great oh
[1:47:27] you're a love beautiful sign
[1:47:30] but the sign tells you keep going
[1:47:34] do you understand that
[1:47:36] keep going when you saw the sign and end
[1:47:40] time seed sign he said it's not me you
[1:47:44] don't look at the sign follow the voice
[1:47:47] that's behind the sign I got nothing to
[1:47:51] do with this
[1:47:53] against my own better judgment I wanted
[1:47:56] to be a Trapper
[1:48:04] went from the prophet to the prophecy
[1:48:08] do you understand that
[1:48:11] we're not looking at the prophet himself
[1:48:14] anymore but at his message
[1:48:18] then as you understand that message
[1:48:22] you become the message
[1:48:25] in other words the message now takes on
[1:48:27] another form what what is it God in
[1:48:30] morpha
[1:48:32] the now the message is no longer on
[1:48:35] tapes
[1:48:37] it's in a body
[1:48:39] Hallelujah
[1:48:40] it's transferring itself God in Martha
[1:48:45] how dare we leave the message on a
[1:48:48] cassette
[1:48:49] brother Ram said mechanical devices are
[1:48:53] not ordained to preach this gospel God
[1:48:56] never used mechanical devices
[1:49:00] somebody says you need to put the
[1:49:02] prophet back in the pulpit
[1:49:06] he never left
[1:49:10] why because God in Martha
[1:49:14] otherwise what happens God left when the
[1:49:18] prophet left
[1:49:21] and to those that feel the prophet left
[1:49:27] okay without fulfilling his ministry
[1:49:30] they say well he's got to come back
[1:49:34] well that's logical
[1:49:37] okay
[1:49:38] that's that's just logical but see God
[1:49:40] doesn't go according to your logic he
[1:49:42] goes by Revelation he's revealing to you
[1:49:46] amen that the ministry never stopped
[1:49:50] what God did is he transferred himself
[1:49:53] into another body
[1:49:56] God in Martha
[1:50:04] all right let me show you something in
[1:50:05] the scripture
[1:50:08] what God is doing now by the new birth
[1:50:11] and by adoption you've got to First be
[1:50:13] born a son
[1:50:15] and that son's got to come to adoption
[1:50:18] brother Ram said to your new birth
[1:50:21] is not
[1:50:23] your adoption it's not the Seal of God
[1:50:28] read it
[1:50:30] and hear his adoption series
[1:50:33] and you will find out he said one is a
[1:50:36] birth the other is an adoption it's a
[1:50:38] placing
[1:50:40] you can't be placed as a son until
[1:50:43] you've been under tutors and governors
[1:50:45] and you've been shown faithful
[1:50:48] and your obedient son and then God says
[1:50:51] hear ye my son and who I'm well pleased
[1:50:56] okay now Colossians 2 verses 8 through
[1:50:59] 15 beware lest any man spoil you through
[1:51:03] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[1:51:05] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[1:51:08] the world and not after Christ
[1:51:11] for in him dwelleth fullness of the
[1:51:13] godhead bodily
[1:51:15] and ye are complete in him
[1:51:18] let me tell you none of you have been
[1:51:21] shortchanged on what you need to get to
[1:51:23] the resurrection
[1:51:25] you are complete in him
[1:51:28] which is the head of all principality
[1:51:30] and Power in whom you also are crucified
[1:51:33] with the circumcision
[1:51:36] I excuse me in whom you're also
[1:51:38] circumcised with the circumcision made
[1:51:41] without hands what is that
[1:51:43] Holy Spirit and putting off the body of
[1:51:46] the sins of Flesh by the circumcision of
[1:51:49] Christ buried with him in baptism we're
[1:51:52] in also
[1:51:54] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:51:56] of the operation of God who raised him
[1:51:59] from the dead and you being dead in your
[1:52:02] sins and the uncircumcision of your
[1:52:05] flesh hath he quickened together with
[1:52:07] him heaven
[1:52:10] of course having forgiven you all your
[1:52:13] trespasses
[1:52:16] having what forgiven you all your
[1:52:21] trespasses
[1:52:22] blotting out
[1:52:24] that you know what they when they have a
[1:52:28] like in our government when they have a
[1:52:30] report and then they have a redacted
[1:52:33] report which means a lot of it is
[1:52:36] blacked out
[1:52:38] well our redacted version of our life
[1:52:42] has been blotted out
[1:52:46] bloody now the handwriting of ordinances
[1:52:49] that was against us he did this he did
[1:52:52] this he did this no redactive version
[1:52:54] said he staggered not
[1:53:00] which was contrary to us and took it out
[1:53:03] of the way kneeling it to the Cross
[1:53:06] having spoiled principalities and powers
[1:53:09] and he made a show of them openly
[1:53:12] triumphing over them and it
[1:53:15] God changing his mask
[1:53:18] he is a God
[1:53:20] he was made to be a god this is in the
[1:53:22] sermon the Messiah I want to show you
[1:53:23] this
[1:53:24] because I'm going to take a detour here
[1:53:26] now for just a moment before we bring
[1:53:29] this to a close
[1:53:30] now brother Brown says in the sermon the
[1:53:32] Messiah there's something about a man
[1:53:36] he is a God
[1:53:40] he was made
[1:53:43] to be a god
[1:53:45] his purpose here on Earth
[1:53:48] was to be a god
[1:53:51] to have dominion over everything
[1:53:55] in the earth oh my
[1:53:58] don't let that stagger you
[1:54:01] because I got more scriptures
[1:54:03] wrote down here
[1:54:06] man
[1:54:07] was made to be a god
[1:54:10] now how do you know what is your purpose
[1:54:13] how do you know your place in the body
[1:54:14] of Christ
[1:54:16] questions answers 1961. how does anyone
[1:54:20] know their rightful position in the body
[1:54:21] of Christ
[1:54:24] Ah that's a good one very good
[1:54:27] that'd be the kind of question amongst
[1:54:28] many of us here tonight
[1:54:30] how do you rightfully know now I'm
[1:54:33] presuming that this brother wants to
[1:54:34] know what position what in Christ what
[1:54:37] part of Christ do I play
[1:54:40] now friend said I'd like to say to this
[1:54:42] brother
[1:54:43] to give you the best answer I know your
[1:54:45] position in Christ is revealed to you by
[1:54:48] the Holy Spirit
[1:54:52] all right
[1:54:53] not your pastor
[1:54:56] not the preacher not the teacher
[1:54:59] it's revealed to you by the Holy Ghost
[1:55:03] everyone has to have a place and a
[1:55:05] position in the body of Christ
[1:55:08] you know the body of Christ made up of
[1:55:10] many members right just like your body
[1:55:11] is made up of many members can a hand
[1:55:13] say under the foot I have no need of
[1:55:15] Thee
[1:55:16] there are parts of your body that you
[1:55:19] never see you never hear of
[1:55:22] in fact you don't know anything about it
[1:55:25] whether it's your pancreas
[1:55:28] or some little part inside of you
[1:55:33] and you never see it unless it's got a
[1:55:36] problem and then they might cut you open
[1:55:40] and you might see that that little body
[1:55:42] part has a problem
[1:55:45] now
[1:55:46] there are times and one day I'm going to
[1:55:49] preach on this
[1:55:51] there are times when
[1:55:54] there's parts of the body that need to
[1:55:56] be cut off
[1:55:58] amputated
[1:56:01] Jesus said if you're I offend you
[1:56:07] pluck it out if your hand offends you
[1:56:14] better to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:56:16] maimed
[1:56:18] this Jesus words
[1:56:21] and sometimes there is need
[1:56:24] that there is sick members of the body
[1:56:29] the Bible says after the second and
[1:56:31] third admonition do what
[1:56:33] reject
[1:56:36] don't even bit him God's speed don't sit
[1:56:38] down and have dinner with them
[1:56:40] is that right this is the scripture now
[1:56:43] there is a time when you just say hey I
[1:56:45] cut it off
[1:56:48] I'm done
[1:56:49] you're a sick member
[1:56:51] and so sometimes there is a time when
[1:56:54] the shuck is not air with the wheat
[1:56:58] God's a separator
[1:57:00] is that right his word is a sharp
[1:57:02] two-edged sword
[1:57:04] dividing asunder between Body Spirit huh
[1:57:08] and your soul
[1:57:10] amen now watch
[1:57:14] everyone has a place from now now what
[1:57:16] Satan wants to do as he fooled Eve
[1:57:22] he wants her to think she needs more
[1:57:24] knowledge to be like God
[1:57:27] fact in Genesis 3 Verses 4 and 5.
[1:57:30] serpent said to the woman you shall
[1:57:31] surely not die there was her first lie
[1:57:35] and he said she re by the reason
[1:57:39] her reasoning he she stopped to listen
[1:57:42] do you know the channel that the devil
[1:57:43] uses on most people today the channel of
[1:57:45] reasoning
[1:57:52] and it says
[1:57:54] then for God
[1:57:56] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:58:00] your eyes shall be open and you shall be
[1:58:03] as Gods yeah where did I sign up I want
[1:58:08] to know good and evil I want you to
[1:58:10] understand they never knew evil before
[1:58:13] it was not in their vocabulary they
[1:58:16] didn't know nakedness they didn't know
[1:58:17] shame they didn't know Gill
[1:58:20] they were pure in the eyes of God they
[1:58:22] only knew good
[1:58:25] So Adam and Eve were already in a
[1:58:28] Godlike state
[1:58:30] but he tried to tell them oh you want to
[1:58:33] be more like God knowing Good and Evil
[1:58:37] and so they aided the tree of knowledge
[1:58:39] through reasoning and guess what it did
[1:58:40] brought forth sin and sin brought forth
[1:58:42] death
[1:58:44] they never knew evil before
[1:58:48] they didn't know they were naked before
[1:58:51] they didn't know guilt and shame before
[1:58:55] they never feared God and ran from the
[1:58:57] presence of God
[1:59:00] they had never made a fig Leaf religion
[1:59:02] to cover their nakedness they didn't
[1:59:05] need to why
[1:59:07] they were already Godlike
[1:59:11] now
[1:59:13] we know and I read to you here's where
[1:59:16] I'm going to detour for just a minute
[1:59:18] and I need all of you to be very much
[1:59:20] aware and stay with me for a moment
[1:59:25] the Bible says that your God is the god
[1:59:28] of Gods
[1:59:29] is that right
[1:59:31] he's the Mighty God he's the one in true
[1:59:33] God
[1:59:35] and so we would agree we read it in the
[1:59:37] Old Testament and we saw it in the New
[1:59:39] Testament for there are many gods and
[1:59:41] many lords
[1:59:44] do you agree to that
[1:59:46] there are many gods what kind of gods
[1:59:48] are they
[1:59:49] we're going to look at this for a moment
[1:59:52] in Exodus 20 verses 20 through 5. excuse
[1:59:56] me 20 2-5 I am the Lord thy God which
[2:00:00] have brought thee out of the land of
[2:00:01] Egypt out of the house of bondage
[2:00:04] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[2:00:07] small G you'll have no other
[2:00:10] Gods before me Thou shalt make
[2:00:14] not make unto thee any Graven image
[2:00:17] or any likeness of anything that is in
[2:00:20] heaven above or on Earth beneath right
[2:00:25] I don't want no craving image
[2:00:29] or that's in the water or under the
[2:00:31] Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
[2:00:34] them nor serve them
[2:00:36] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[2:00:39] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[2:00:41] upon the children under the third and
[2:00:43] fourth generation of them that hate me
[2:00:45] the Bible lists worshiping or serving
[2:00:48] other gods 63 times in your Bible
[2:00:52] Thou shalt not serve other
[2:00:55] gods
[2:00:58] Israel was forbidden to worship or to
[2:01:02] walk
[2:01:03] or to serve or to burn incense to other
[2:01:07] gods
[2:01:11] I have multitudes of scriptures running
[2:01:13] to just show you one we're going to go
[2:01:15] to the First Kings and if you'd like to
[2:01:17] turn with me because we're going to do
[2:01:18] some reading
[2:01:20] First Kings excuse me Second Kings
[2:01:23] chapter 17 Second Kings
[2:01:26] chapter 17 verse 26 through 41.
[2:01:30] wherefore they spake unto the king of
[2:01:32] Assyria saying the Nations
[2:01:35] which thou Hast removed and placed in
[2:01:37] the cities of Samaria
[2:01:39] no not the manner of the god of the land
[2:01:44] therefore he has sent Lions among them
[2:01:46] and behold they they slay them because
[2:01:50] they know not the manner of the god of
[2:01:52] the land
[2:01:53] then the king of Assyria command and
[2:01:55] said carry thither one of the priests
[2:01:58] whom you brought from fence and let them
[2:02:01] go and dwell there and let him teach
[2:02:04] them the manner of the god of the land
[2:02:07] then one of the priests whom
[2:02:09] they had carried away from Samaria came
[2:02:12] and dwelt in Bethel House of God
[2:02:15] and taught them how they should fear the
[2:02:17] lord
[2:02:18] how be it every nation meet gods of
[2:02:21] Their Own
[2:02:23] put them in the houses
[2:02:25] of the high places with the Samaritans
[2:02:28] had made every nation in their cities
[2:02:31] wherein they dwell and the men of
[2:02:33] Babylon
[2:02:34] Babylon made sukov benoth any of you
[2:02:37] ever
[2:02:38] studied sukov Benoit
[2:02:42] and the men of couth
[2:02:45] made near gal and the men of hamath made
[2:02:48] Ashima and if you ever studied that
[2:02:52] and the ivytes made
[2:02:54] nibes and tarkad and the seraphites
[2:02:57] burnt their children in the fire to
[2:02:59] adrenalic and animelech the gods of
[2:03:02] seraphim
[2:03:04] so they feared the Lord and made on
[2:03:06] themselves the laws and Priests of the
[2:03:08] high places which sacrifice for them in
[2:03:11] the houses of high places they feared
[2:03:13] the Lord
[2:03:15] and
[2:03:17] served their own Gods
[2:03:20] mixing Christianity and idolatry
[2:03:25] after the manner of Nations whom They
[2:03:28] carried away from things
[2:03:30] unto this day they do after the manner
[2:03:33] former manners they do not fear the lord
[2:03:35] neither do they
[2:03:36] neither do they after their statutes or
[2:03:40] after their ordinances or after the law
[2:03:42] and the Commandment which the Lord
[2:03:43] commanded the children of Jacob whom he
[2:03:46] named Israel
[2:03:48] with whom the Lord made a covenant
[2:03:50] charge them saying ye shall not fear
[2:03:52] other gods nor bow yourselves to them
[2:03:55] nor serve them nor sacrifice through
[2:03:57] them but the Lord who brought you out of
[2:03:58] the land of Egypt with great power and
[2:04:00] has stretched out arm him shall ye fear
[2:04:03] in him shall ye worship and to him you
[2:04:06] shall lose sacrifice
[2:04:09] verse 37 you should not fear the other
[2:04:11] gods
[2:04:13] verse 38 in the Covenant that I made
[2:04:15] with you you shall not forget neither
[2:04:16] shall you fear other gods
[2:04:20] but the Lord your God ye shall fear
[2:04:22] verse 40. so these nations feared the
[2:04:25] Lord and served their grave and images
[2:04:28] both their children and their children's
[2:04:30] children as their father as did their
[2:04:33] fathers so do they unto this day now
[2:04:35] sukhoth Benoit I I'm just going to give
[2:04:38] you
[2:04:39] in second
[2:04:40] Kings 17 verse 30. the men of Babylon
[2:04:44] made sukov Benoit
[2:04:46] it literally means the Tabernacles of
[2:04:49] the daughters
[2:04:51] or young women
[2:04:54] who became public prostitutes
[2:04:57] at the Temple of Venus among the
[2:05:00] Babylonians their Temple prostitutes
[2:05:05] spiritual
[2:05:07] fornication
[2:05:09] brother Ram said a religious spirit is a
[2:05:12] fornicating sexual sensual enticing
[2:05:16] lascivious unclean Jezebel well do I
[2:05:20] need to keep going
[2:05:24] and sukov benoth
[2:05:27] were Temple priestesses who crossed who
[2:05:30] were prostitute
[2:05:31] dedicated to the worship of Venus who
[2:05:34] was called the god of love
[2:05:38] how about the men of kuth made nirgo is
[2:05:42] supposed to be the
[2:05:43] they were serving the
[2:05:45] the god
[2:05:47] of the Sun
[2:05:49] or the God of Light
[2:05:54] in fact the emblem of that was a rooster
[2:05:59] now follow this they said because the
[2:06:01] rooster when the sun comes
[2:06:05] he always says something at the coming
[2:06:07] of light
[2:06:09] so they made him
[2:06:10] the god of the orb or the god of the son
[2:06:13] it's a false light
[2:06:17] and the men of hamath made Ashima
[2:06:21] it was the god of fire
[2:06:24] for the atonement to purify the people
[2:06:26] they worshiped Strange Fire
[2:06:30] how many of you know that in the Bible
[2:06:32] says and Men offered unto God's Strange
[2:06:36] Fire and what did God do he slew
[2:06:41] years ago when I was in high school
[2:06:43] there was a
[2:06:45] I don't even remember
[2:06:47] the rock and roll group's name but it
[2:06:49] came out and it got banned by most of
[2:06:51] the stations
[2:06:53] and it starts out I am the Lord I am the
[2:06:56] god of Hellfire and I bring you fire
[2:07:00] and it goes on
[2:07:02] and the people wow I didn't even want to
[2:07:05] play it for you guys
[2:07:07] but it starts out I am the god of
[2:07:09] Hellfire and I bring you fire
[2:07:13] and that's the what the whole song is
[2:07:15] about fire people are playing today with
[2:07:19] things that's going to burn them
[2:07:25] they talk about hell as though it's a
[2:07:28] game
[2:07:30] I remember in Germany we had we were
[2:07:33] having a Bible study with Saints we were
[2:07:35] there
[2:07:36] and just down the street was one of
[2:07:39] those discos back when the discos were
[2:07:41] really big and the lights and all this
[2:07:43] and you can hear the Thump Thump Thump
[2:07:44] and the boom boom like this and we walk
[2:07:46] outside after the Bible study
[2:07:48] and there was all the young people they
[2:07:51] were outside smoke coming out the doors
[2:07:53] and there was hundreds of kids out there
[2:07:56] and I can hear today in my mind
[2:08:00] the song that they were playing and all
[2:08:02] of them were out there and they were
[2:08:04] reveling in this
[2:08:08] Highway to Hell
[2:08:11] I'm on a Highway to Hell and they're all
[2:08:15] out here High way to hell
[2:08:19] hi way to hell
[2:08:21] under an anointing and I want you to
[2:08:25] understand God I'm gonna I'm gonna talk
[2:08:26] to you about other
[2:08:29] gods
[2:08:31] and we're going to talk about these
[2:08:32] other gods and then I'm going to let you
[2:08:34] go and then I'm gonna
[2:08:35] try to bring it back around perhaps on
[2:08:38] the next service
[2:08:40] now
[2:08:44] brother Brahm says in the God of this
[2:08:47] evil age there are two classes of people
[2:08:49] spoke of in the New Testament children
[2:08:51] of God
[2:08:53] Children of the devil
[2:08:55] did you know that
[2:08:57] put the scripture down first First John
[2:08:59] 3 10 Ephesians 2 2. they're called the
[2:09:02] children of disobedience
[2:09:04] then how can the Brady Christ associate
[2:09:07] with the denomination
[2:09:09] when one is disobedient the other one
[2:09:11] obedient how can one by be the word and
[2:09:13] the other one want a perverted word
[2:09:16] how can a prostitute and a clean woman
[2:09:18] walk together in an agreement they can't
[2:09:20] do it they have no fellowship at all
[2:09:21] come out from amongst them
[2:09:23] it's of the devil it's the mark of the
[2:09:25] beast heading right into it now all
[2:09:27] denominations I don't care who it is
[2:09:29] God is taking not a denomination
[2:09:32] of people for his name a denomination
[2:09:35] won't receive these truths
[2:09:38] it'll take an individual person that can
[2:09:40] see God look at his word and believe it
[2:09:42] belong to no organization but live for
[2:09:45] God not for his organization the
[2:09:48] intellectual wisdom some Bishop is
[2:09:50] something that's taught it that's right
[2:09:52] both lines two Vines
[2:09:55] one of God
[2:09:57] one of the devil
[2:09:59] children of God children of God of the
[2:10:01] devil are now being made manifest First
[2:10:04] John 3 verse 8. now he the kid is meneth
[2:10:08] sin is of the devil
[2:10:11] for the devil's sinneth from the
[2:10:12] beginning
[2:10:14] for the purpose the Son of God was
[2:10:16] manifest that he might destroy the works
[2:10:18] of the devil whosoever is born of God
[2:10:20] does not commit sin why the seed
[2:10:23] remaineth in him he cannot sin because
[2:10:26] he is one of God in this the children of
[2:10:28] God are manifest and the children of the
[2:10:31] devil
[2:10:32] two seeds
[2:10:34] two kinds of worship
[2:10:36] both being gods two Vines
[2:10:39] now the prophet made us aware of certain
[2:10:42] Gods Among Us
[2:10:44] other
[2:10:45] gods
[2:10:48] did you know that Satan wanted to be
[2:10:50] worshiped as God
[2:10:52] he is called the God of this world
[2:10:56] he is called three times in the New
[2:10:58] Testament he is the prince
[2:11:01] of this world
[2:11:08] Satan desires to be worshiped as God
[2:11:12] to rise himself above the Throne of God
[2:11:17] Isaiah 14 verses 12 through 4. how art
[2:11:21] thou art fallen from heaven or lose
[2:11:23] first son of the morning how art thou
[2:11:25] cut down to the ground which did weaken
[2:11:27] the Nations
[2:11:29] so for thou has said in thine heart I
[2:11:31] will Ascend into heaven
[2:11:34] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[2:11:37] of God
[2:11:39] I will sit
[2:11:41] also upon the mountain of the
[2:11:45] congregation and the sides of the north
[2:11:47] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[2:11:49] clouds
[2:11:51] I will be like the most high
[2:11:57] that's what's going on right now
[2:12:00] just as God is cloning himself
[2:12:04] in elect seed
[2:12:06] it's him
[2:12:08] it's Christ in you
[2:12:11] but Satan is cloning himself
[2:12:14] in his life
[2:12:16] is in them
[2:12:17] because his seed
[2:12:19] is in them
[2:12:25] the Bible says in second Corinthians 4
[2:12:27] verses three and four
[2:12:29] but if our gospel be hid it's hid to
[2:12:31] them that are
[2:12:33] lost
[2:12:36] in whom the God of this world hath
[2:12:39] blinded the minds of them which believed
[2:12:41] I don't believe it of course you don't
[2:12:44] you're not seen he said if you're elect
[2:12:47] seed you hear the word the word you see
[2:12:49] it you believe it huh
[2:12:52] Lord tell us what we can do to work the
[2:12:54] works of God he said only believe
[2:12:56] that's why he said that's my theme song
[2:13:00] only believe
[2:13:03] well tell me what I can do to work the
[2:13:05] works of God just believe
[2:13:07] seeds of God that's all God requires of
[2:13:09] you is to believe he didn't say you have
[2:13:11] to understand it all just believe it all
[2:13:14] right now
[2:13:18] have you noticed how everybody is
[2:13:20] getting all the same kind of mind that
[2:13:22] are in the world right now
[2:13:24] vaccination will prove it
[2:13:26] because the the unvaccinated
[2:13:31] we shall keep them from being in a job
[2:13:34] they shall not buy or sell on a
[2:13:38] vaccination
[2:13:41] hey right they believe in my body my
[2:13:45] choice
[2:13:46] but if you're unvaccinated you're going
[2:13:49] all right
[2:13:50] you do it for the sake of everybody else
[2:13:52] you're not going to go to the hospital
[2:13:54] doctor's not going to treat you why you
[2:13:56] don't go you weren't vaccinated I'll
[2:13:58] tell you what I wasn't vaccinated I was
[2:14:00] inoculated
[2:14:04] yeah
[2:14:05] all of this kind of so now I'm putting
[2:14:09] pressure military police firemen
[2:14:12] people have been on uh you know a job
[2:14:16] for 30 35 years ready to retire and
[2:14:20] you ain't vaccinated I'm just showing
[2:14:22] you what's happening to the minds of the
[2:14:25] people because they're all getting under
[2:14:27] one spirit
[2:14:28] they're coming under the image of the
[2:14:30] Beast and you won't be able to buy or
[2:14:33] sell watch the inspiration behind it
[2:14:37] okay
[2:14:39] because of the mark of the beast is
[2:14:42] acting out amongst the people in the
[2:14:45] world
[2:14:45] they're acting it out the
[2:14:50] mind of their father
[2:14:53] just the same as the Seal of God is
[2:14:55] acting out in your life
[2:14:58] in the life of a believer
[2:15:00] who the God of this world
[2:15:03] is acting himself out in unregenerated
[2:15:06] people in non-seed
[2:15:09] The Works of their father they will do
[2:15:13] so the Mighty God is acting himself out
[2:15:17] through you and I
[2:15:19] okay and it's not you doing it but God
[2:15:23] is doing it through you God in Martha
[2:15:26] okay now this is the day of manifested
[2:15:30] sons
[2:15:32] brother Brown said you are
[2:15:35] little Messiahs
[2:15:37] you're made to be Gods man was born for
[2:15:41] this purpose that he might be a God so
[2:15:44] Satan knows that also
[2:15:46] so he's going to have his gods
[2:15:49] because he wants to be like God and he
[2:15:53] wants to have his little gods
[2:15:56] follow along now
[2:16:03] now I'm I'm not going to go on some of
[2:16:06] these say I'm just going to go directly
[2:16:07] you follow uh with me Brothers on Exodus
[2:16:10] 34. let's go to the scripture here
[2:16:13] I've kept you a little bit long this
[2:16:15] morning but I I want to make some points
[2:16:17] here before I let you go
[2:16:19] Exodus 34 verses 14 through 17. Thou
[2:16:22] shalt worship no other God for the Lord
[2:16:25] your God
[2:16:26] for you the Lord whose name is jealous
[2:16:30] is a jealous God
[2:16:32] lest thou make a covenant with the
[2:16:34] inhabitants of the land
[2:16:37] and they go whoring after their gods
[2:16:40] and to sacrifice unto their gods and one
[2:16:43] call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice
[2:16:47] that thou take of their daughters unto
[2:16:49] thy sons and their daughters go a
[2:16:52] whoring after their gods and make thy
[2:16:54] Sons go a whoring after
[2:16:57] their gods notice the word hurry
[2:17:02] Thou shalt make no Molten
[2:17:06] thee no molten God Satan is called the
[2:17:08] prince of this world
[2:17:11] Jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[2:17:13] world
[2:17:14] if it were of this world I would send my
[2:17:17] servants to fight
[2:17:19] but he said my Cosmos is not of this
[2:17:21] world now Satan is a squatter he owns
[2:17:25] or he has a right to this Earth because
[2:17:27] he was cast down to the Earth is that
[2:17:29] right but he's a squatter he don't own
[2:17:31] it he has a he has a right to be here
[2:17:33] because he was sent here
[2:17:35] but God is soon and it's going to happen
[2:17:38] here very soon he's going to take him
[2:17:40] and he's going to run him off and
[2:17:43] there's going and he's going to be bound
[2:17:44] for a thousand years
[2:17:46] and he's not going to have any effect
[2:17:49] praise God we're right about there but
[2:17:51] until then he's going to do all that he
[2:17:54] can to try to get the inhabitants of the
[2:17:57] land to go to whoring after other gods
[2:18:00] now
[2:18:02] let me make you aware of some of the
[2:18:04] gods that brother Branham makes us aware
[2:18:06] of
[2:18:07] how about the God of music
[2:18:09] how many of you know that Lucifer and
[2:18:12] his seed
[2:18:13] and brother Brown said the serpent seed
[2:18:15] were the inventors of musical
[2:18:17] instruments
[2:18:19] he led Worship in heaven
[2:18:22] is that right
[2:18:23] so he knows how to get people anointed
[2:18:26] under music
[2:18:27] brother Ram said you want to know if
[2:18:29] it's a real Revival unplug the organ
[2:18:32] too much of the time we work it up when
[2:18:34] we all get together
[2:18:38] let me get everybody oh hey man come on
[2:18:40] let's go you're a Son of God yeah
[2:18:45] and you get them all worked up by the
[2:18:47] songs
[2:18:48] brother random didn't do that
[2:18:52] go listen are you listening to the same
[2:18:54] tapes I listened to
[2:18:56] some of the greatest anointings
[2:18:58] he's not screaming he's not shouting
[2:19:01] he's not dancing all over the pulpit
[2:19:04] there's a time for that brother REM said
[2:19:07] I I there's nothing wrong with shouty
[2:19:10] he said there's nothing wrong with
[2:19:12] dancing there's nothing wrong with all
[2:19:14] those speaking in tongues but I want to
[2:19:15] know the kind of life you live after
[2:19:18] you're done
[2:19:21] all right
[2:19:23] so how about the God of music
[2:19:30] Elvis brother REM said became a God to
[2:19:33] the people
[2:19:34] they worshiped him they idolized him
[2:19:39] rock stars today have been given a
[2:19:42] god-like status
[2:19:45] I don't care if it's the Beatles Rolling
[2:19:47] Stones or Madonna
[2:19:49] any one of them and you know what they
[2:19:51] are Godlike
[2:19:53] wow millions and millions of dollars
[2:19:56] because of the way that they sing their
[2:19:59] music
[2:20:01] if you're not careful brother Brown said
[2:20:03] now you parents be careful what you let
[2:20:06] your kids put on the wall
[2:20:10] right some picture of some rock star
[2:20:16] Satan uses the wrong kind of music to
[2:20:19] bring the condition of the Mind
[2:20:21] to where he can
[2:20:23] brainwash him
[2:20:27] because the right kind of music
[2:20:30] brings
[2:20:31] God's presence and demons flee right
[2:20:34] kind of music
[2:20:36] right kind of music David played the
[2:20:38] right kind of music on the heart guess
[2:20:40] what demons left Saul
[2:20:43] wrong kind of music
[2:20:46] brings demonic influence
[2:20:50] how about the God of science or the god
[2:20:52] of Education
[2:20:54] and did you know that everyone in the
[2:20:56] world today is forced to megadose and
[2:20:59] make your children eat at the tree of
[2:21:01] knowledge
[2:21:03] Science Education you're not going to
[2:21:05] let your kids stay home they're going to
[2:21:07] go to school they're going to have to go
[2:21:09] to sixth grade eighth grade they're
[2:21:10] going to go through high school and if
[2:21:12] they want a good job they got to go to
[2:21:13] college
[2:21:18] you want a good high paying job today
[2:21:20] you're gonna have to go to college
[2:21:24] that's where world's telling you so if
[2:21:26] we're not careful we've got all of our
[2:21:28] professional students
[2:21:31] are children that go to school and get
[2:21:34] degree after degree
[2:21:39] you're forced to eat of the tree of
[2:21:41] knowledge
[2:21:42] and I've seen
[2:21:44] young people
[2:21:45] that were good kids that go to
[2:21:48] university and universities are probably
[2:21:51] the biggest Cesspool of immorality you
[2:21:54] could get around
[2:21:56] okay
[2:21:58] this is my opinion
[2:22:00] take it or leave it
[2:22:02] but I've seen good young people go to
[2:22:05] college
[2:22:07] and they throw away everything they ever
[2:22:10] knew within a matter of weeks
[2:22:13] because they're eating of the tree of
[2:22:15] noise so
[2:22:16] they Mega dose on science and education
[2:22:19] and brother Brenham said watch science
[2:22:22] has broke into God's Great Laboratory
[2:22:24] so now DNA and all this stuff and
[2:22:27] cloning it
[2:22:30] Science Education how about the God of
[2:22:31] sports
[2:22:33] hmm
[2:22:35] huh
[2:22:36] yeah
[2:22:38] I remember and I'm going to tell this
[2:22:40] here and I've told you guys before I was
[2:22:42] up there in Canada
[2:22:44] and I went to the little church there in
[2:22:46] in Weldon

[2:24:14] come on jump up
[2:24:15] [Applause]
[2:24:18] I said why aren't you doing it you did
[2:24:19] it
[2:24:21] this past Sunday
[2:24:26] now God of sports and I like sports
[2:24:30] there is nothing wrong with a sport
[2:24:33] except for the fact that if you get your
[2:24:36] kids and they become too good in it
[2:24:40] they will be enticed by the god of
[2:24:43] sports
[2:24:49] okay and then it's gonna be hard for you
[2:24:51] to get them out of it
[2:24:53] because they're good
[2:24:55] okay
[2:24:57] the god of sports and look at these guys
[2:24:59] they make millions of dollars because
[2:25:02] nothing but net
[2:25:04] they become god-like status
[2:25:07] and so their pictures and their names
[2:25:09] are put on T-shirts and people wear it
[2:25:12] and they these people become a God to
[2:25:15] the
[2:25:15] masses
[2:25:17] the god of sports nothing wrong with the
[2:25:19] sport
[2:25:21] but to make the people to play it a god
[2:25:24] thou shall have no other
[2:25:26] and it's so important
[2:25:28] I can't come to church on Sunday because
[2:25:30] I got to play my game
[2:25:38] how about the God of money
[2:25:41] hmm
[2:25:45] that you
[2:25:48] will miss church
[2:25:51] you will do things for your career
[2:25:55] because you need money
[2:26:00] hey everybody needs money
[2:26:02] that's true I'm not hey but it's the
[2:26:04] Love of Money
[2:26:06] and the next thing you know
[2:26:09] you're enticed obit and well the ox is
[2:26:11] in the ditch yeah as long as you didn't
[2:26:13] push him there
[2:26:15] I see so many of them push it in there
[2:26:17] the god of money
[2:26:21] how about the God of fashion
[2:26:23] musicians come I'm I I'm closing
[2:26:28] how about the God of fashion do you bow
[2:26:30] your knee
[2:26:33] to the god of fashion
[2:26:35] sisters
[2:26:37] watch the trends among the women
[2:26:41] because the Bible says take not your
[2:26:43] beauty did you know that Satan dwells in
[2:26:46] Beauty
[2:26:47] did you know that one of the signs of
[2:26:49] the end time is the increase of Beauty
[2:26:51] in women
[2:26:52] he said but God dwells in character not
[2:26:55] in Beauty
[2:26:56] right
[2:26:57] says said if you're not careful what
[2:26:59] happened just like it was in in the Anna
[2:27:01] deluvian destruction when the sons of
[2:27:04] God saw the daughters of man were fair
[2:27:06] and they took unto them wives
[2:27:08] is that right he said watch the increase
[2:27:10] of the beauty of women
[2:27:13] so the god of fashion
[2:27:16] these styles of clothes that come in
[2:27:18] Well everybody's doing it does that make
[2:27:20] it right
[2:27:22] hemlines are getting shorter
[2:27:26] low necks are coming back in jewelry is
[2:27:29] ex is accepted
[2:27:32] all kinds of
[2:27:34] things that what is it it's the god of
[2:27:36] fashion
[2:27:39] and it happened even with brother
[2:27:41] brenham's family
[2:27:43] he talked about high-heeled shoes
[2:27:48] you remember when he got his family
[2:27:49] together he told Billy get Billy get the
[2:27:51] girls together I got thus saith the Lord
[2:27:54] Rebecca Smith said brother Ron when
[2:27:56] Daddy got our women together and put us
[2:28:00] in the room and told us I got thus saith
[2:28:03] the Lord
[2:28:04] he said how many times have I told you
[2:28:07] to get rid of those high-heeled shoes
[2:28:10] and he says and after I tell you you go
[2:28:13] and you clean out your closet he said
[2:28:16] just a couple months later you buy them
[2:28:18] again
[2:28:19] he said I'm going to tell you for the
[2:28:21] last time
[2:28:24] when he said now
[2:28:25] you wear those high-heeled shoes
[2:28:30] he said it's going to be upon you not me
[2:28:32] I've already told you
[2:28:34] so he has to apply the word to his own
[2:28:37] family
[2:28:38] and we as pastors huh we do the same
[2:28:41] thing how hey would it be wrong for me
[2:28:44] to tell everybody else that thou shall
[2:28:45] not be fashionable and immoral clothes
[2:28:48] and cut your hair and yet my own kids do
[2:28:50] it
[2:28:52] you'd say there's something wrong
[2:28:53] somewhere
[2:29:00] Brethren I'm going to ask you take a
[2:29:01] look
[2:29:03] at your wives your wife
[2:29:07] I caught that
[2:29:10] take a look at your wife
[2:29:13] and see how she's dressed
[2:29:19] take a look at your your children
[2:29:24] and why the women
[2:29:25] because a woman is the type of the
[2:29:27] church
[2:29:28] brother Ram said look at the women in
[2:29:31] the church it'll tell you the condition
[2:29:34] of the church is that right
[2:29:36] he said that's why I'm always people
[2:29:38] think I'm against women he said I'm not
[2:29:40] he said I'm just against bad ones
[2:29:43] now
[2:29:45] how about the God of alcohol and drugs
[2:29:48] well it'll never happen in our family it
[2:29:50] never happened among the message
[2:29:51] believers
[2:29:53] are you kidding me
[2:29:56] just drop your guard one time
[2:30:00] I tell you the drugs that were back in
[2:30:02] the time when I was a young man are
[2:30:05] nothing
[2:30:07] compared because Satan has taken and
[2:30:10] refined the drugs to where they are so
[2:30:14] potent huh
[2:30:17] what
[2:30:18] man Superman
[2:30:22] one snort

[2:30:49] own family
[2:30:51] that's why we need to hold the token
[2:30:54] over our families

[2:32:25] god of the social media
[2:32:29] God's got a net Satan's got a net
[2:32:34] do you remember brother Ram said the
[2:32:37] radio could have been a real blessing
[2:32:40] and he said but the misuse of it the
[2:32:42] devil took it right
[2:32:44] the radio could have been yeah people
[2:32:46] could hear Brother Branham preach on the
[2:32:49] radio
[2:32:51] could have been a great blessing how
[2:32:53] about the television could have been a
[2:32:55] great blessing he said to misuse of it
[2:32:57] how about the telephone he said yeah the
[2:32:59] telephone could have been a great
[2:33:01] blessing he said look at what he's done

[2:33:04] television and the internet all this
[2:33:07] stuff is now in one in your cell phone
[2:33:09] and you give that to your kids

[2:33:20] huh it's the biggest Pacifier that
[2:33:24] parents give to their children today and
[2:33:26] it's wrong

[2:33:58] he said it's a woman
[2:34:00] have you noticed that in nearly every
[2:34:03] powerful place of government military
[2:34:07] right now what is it
[2:34:09] a woman
[2:34:10] he said it's a woman's age he said a
[2:34:13] woman is the god of America
[2:34:16] and now so you see and what that is now
[2:34:19] just watch this because there's always a
[2:34:21] parallel because the Bride is a powerful
[2:34:24] woman coming into position
[2:34:27] so what the devil's doing he's having
[2:34:29] his women
[2:34:31] Jezebel coming into her position right
[2:34:35] brother Ram said
[2:34:38] wow they're just so many things I could
[2:34:40] say
[2:34:41] the god of America
[2:34:45] is a woman
[2:34:47] how about the God
[2:34:50] or gods of the ministry
[2:34:56] brother Brahm said when you make me God
[2:34:58] you make me Antichrist
[2:35:01] and yet God was in him
[2:35:03] because were they not gods
[2:35:06] whom the word of the Lord come to
[2:35:08] but he says watch he said it's a fine
[2:35:11] line
[2:35:13] he says yes he says
[2:35:16] how that we worship the God that was in
[2:35:20] the prophet he said it's not me
[2:35:23] he said
[2:35:25] have I been with you so long that you
[2:35:27] don't realize it's not me that does
[2:35:29] these things well I'm just near when his
[2:35:32] Spirit comes down
[2:35:34] uh he said it's not me that says he
[2:35:36] Saints it's him
[2:35:39] brother Branham while he's under the
[2:35:41] anointing
[2:35:42] are those things true
[2:35:44] well I see now and I see a spirit I see
[2:35:47] you why why yes here it is this is
[2:35:51] what's troubling you you were a little
[2:35:54] girl this and this happened and then all
[2:35:56] of a sudden he shakes his head and she's
[2:35:58] going yes yes he goes are those things
[2:36:00] true he said it's gone from me now
[2:36:03] and if she didn't catch it he said wait
[2:36:05] just a second
[2:36:07] he said I'm going deeper into the vision
[2:36:09] now watch a prophet he goes forward into
[2:36:12] time or back into time
[2:36:15] and most of the time when he's in
[2:36:17] discernment
[2:36:18] he says
[2:36:20] why he said
[2:36:22] do you believe me to be God's servant
[2:36:25] he says
[2:36:27] do you believe me to be God's servant
[2:36:30] or God's prophet he said wait just a
[2:36:31] moment he said Prophet that means
[2:36:33] servant
[2:36:34] he says some people get stumbled by that
[2:36:36] and he begins to talk he said I want to
[2:36:38] contact your spirit
[2:36:41] I'm content I'm doing this for a purpose
[2:36:43] I'm contacting your spirit
[2:36:45] he said oh yes
[2:36:47] I see now
[2:36:49] what he's doing he's stepping into a
[2:36:52] vision
[2:36:53] he's seeing it so
[2:36:56] perfectly before him
[2:36:58] he hears the conversation he sees the
[2:37:02] doctor he hears the diagnosis he hears
[2:37:05] all of that he knows where they come
[2:37:07] from and on and on he begins to tell
[2:37:10] those things and then all of a sudden he
[2:37:11] shakes his head and he goes
[2:37:14] are those things true of course it's
[2:37:16] left me whatever it was whatever he told
[2:37:20] you
[2:37:21] you believe
[2:37:23] now what if we take brother Branham too
[2:37:26] far and we make
[2:37:27] brother Brenham God
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:31] what did the three Hebrew children
[2:37:33] refuse to bow to in the day of Daniel
[2:37:38] they made an image to Daniel the Prophet
[2:37:42] and they said we shall not bow
[2:37:45] okay
[2:37:47] read your Bibles
[2:37:50] now in closing let me give you just one
[2:37:52] last quote
[2:37:55] Revelation chapter 5 in fact brother
[2:37:59] Branham had a sermon called who is
[2:38:00] William Branham
[2:38:02] any of you Old-Timers you know there are
[2:38:05] many titles that have been changed when
[2:38:08] Joseph got he went ahead and changed a
[2:38:10] lot of the title titles great harlot
[2:38:13] who is William Branham it's Revelations
[2:38:15] chapter four for those of you that don't
[2:38:17] know in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:38:20] Theory the original sermon who is
[2:38:21] William Branham
[2:38:23] this is Revelation chapter five so
[2:38:25] follow along with me on this
[2:38:27] there's at least 15 or 20 people sitting
[2:38:29] right here it's guilty of thinking I was
[2:38:31] Jesus Christ
[2:38:33] wow
[2:38:34] his congregation was about a half of
[2:38:36] what we got right here
[2:38:38] not the whole con about this amount he
[2:38:41] said I got 15 or 20 people sitting right
[2:38:43] here right now thank God it's Jesus
[2:38:44] Christ
[2:38:45] I think if
[2:38:47] we were gone to Branham Tabernacle we'd
[2:38:50] know who those 15 or 20 people were
[2:38:53] right
[2:38:55] of course you would because you heard
[2:38:57] him talk about it all the time well I'll
[2:38:59] tell you what when brother Rand preached
[2:39:01] the sermon he's a god-called man don't
[2:39:03] you get it
[2:39:06] he's a god
[2:39:08] called man
[2:39:10] he's not a god-called man
[2:39:13] do you see him since it's changed the
[2:39:15] emphasis
[2:39:16] brother REM says thinking as Jesus
[2:39:19] Christ how could they do it
[2:39:21] I was right onto them until I found out
[2:39:23] that God told me it was a spirit
[2:39:27] huh
[2:39:28] it's a spirit
[2:39:31] and then men they believed me every word
[2:39:35] I said how do you believe me then
[2:39:37] if I tell you then they got to the word
[2:39:40] they began to see said well sure we
[2:39:42] didn't believe you or we'd have listened
[2:39:44] to what you said see
[2:39:47] but they actually thought they were
[2:39:49] right sincerely
[2:39:50] and any one of them Spirits gets on you
[2:39:52] that's got it you'll absolutely believe
[2:39:55] it I don't care nobody can tell you any
[2:39:57] difference no matter how much the word
[2:40:00] says so well you just don't believe it
[2:40:02] anyhow just go on if you want to be that
[2:40:05] way you go ahead I'm having my own way
[2:40:07] see that shows
[2:40:09] you're Anointed with the wrong spirit
[2:40:14] I'm talking about that you were made to
[2:40:17] be gods
[2:40:19] but if we're not careful we have other
[2:40:21] gods that creep in among us because of
[2:40:24] the land we live in
[2:40:26] the gods of Music Sports money fashion
[2:40:30] all of these can become Gods right in
[2:40:33] amongst our own believers
[2:40:36] I'm not trying to be
[2:40:40] some guy that's just always
[2:40:45] nah
[2:40:46] [Music]
[2:40:49] sometimes I wonder
[2:40:51] brother Brown says I preach against
[2:40:53] women cutting her hair and he said I
[2:40:55] come back from being on the field
[2:40:57] there's more people in my own church
[2:40:58] that cut their hair
[2:41:02] well keep me encouraged Lord
[2:41:06] because sometimes it's not easy being a
[2:41:08] pastor
[2:41:12] would you like my position
[2:41:15] [Music]
[2:41:17] God help me
[2:41:19] help me keep the right attitude Lauren
[2:41:22] I'm not going after people
[2:41:24] I'm going after spirits
[2:41:26] spirits that are trying to come in to
[2:41:29] defile us
[2:41:31] to defile our families take us down
[2:41:35] God help us to raise a standard in this
[2:41:37] last day I appreciate you all coming

[2:42:05] brother minnow
[2:42:07] thank you for being my friend
[2:42:09] [Music]
[2:42:13] when I was in Canada and there for three
[2:42:15] years
[2:42:17] and I went through boot camp man
[2:42:20] yeah
[2:42:21] so in order for me to come down here
[2:42:24] into Arizona which it at that time
[2:42:27] Arizona and it still is
[2:42:30] a hot spot
[2:42:32] for return Ministry
[2:42:37] okay it is
[2:42:39] well in order for me to come down here
[2:42:42] and be able to know what is return
[2:42:44] Ministry
[2:42:46] where does it come from
[2:42:49] give me the quotes where is it in the
[2:42:51] Bible
[2:42:55] because
[2:42:57] if you're not careful what happens you
[2:42:58] just take somebody's word for it instead
[2:43:00] of reading from the scripture and from
[2:43:02] your Bible
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:05] so I had to go up there
[2:43:08] and I sat down on
[2:43:10] [Music]
[2:43:12] and they had asked me if I would
[2:43:14] consider being a pastor up there in
[2:43:17] Canada
[2:43:18] so I told brother Dave Cook yeah I'll
[2:43:20] consider it because Dave
[2:43:22] brother Billy Paul told him he said if I
[2:43:25] were you I'd get brother Ron as faster
[2:43:27] and to him that's thus saith the Lord
[2:43:30] so he ain't gonna

[2:44:00] and you leave Saskatoon and start
[2:44:02] heading north there's only one traffic
[2:44:04] light

[2:44:57] Thorson interrupts me he said brother
[2:44:58] Ron I just got three questions for you

[2:45:04] tent Vision what do you believe in mine
[2:45:06] I said well

[2:45:10] the prophet of God said and I said a few
[2:45:12] things and he said up
[2:45:15] Audrey get up right now I will not sit
[2:45:17] and eat with a man who believes
[2:45:19] Antichrist Doctrine

[2:45:48] and it wound up that
[2:45:51] they voted me in his pastor
[2:45:54] and it's a long story but I tell you God
[2:45:57] had me to go there
[2:45:59] to teach me
[2:46:01] and if you're going to need to let's say
[2:46:05] fight against the doctrine you need to
[2:46:07] know the heartbeat of that Doctrine
[2:46:09] you need to study it hey huh
[2:46:12] it'd be like if you wanted to know about
[2:46:14] Perugia well go up there to a perusian
[2:46:17] church

[2:46:20] to a seven Thunders Church you want to
[2:46:23] know about deity go to a deity Church

[2:46:29] but God did a great and wonderful and
[2:46:32] mighty work while he was up there but
[2:46:33] then God turned around remember in 1987
[2:46:36] God spoke to me he told me to go to
[2:46:37] Arizona
[2:46:39] they had to go by way of Samaria
[2:46:44] but God had a people down here
[2:46:49] and get and I'm looking at them
[2:46:52] I am and I am humbled before all of you
[2:46:57] to say you are some of the finest people

[2:48:33] through it but it's for a purpose
[2:48:36] brother minnow we love you would you

[2:48:47] it is a great thank you God bless you
[2:48:50] my words of this message today
[2:48:54] would be from prophet
[2:48:57] to prophecy to reality
[2:49:01] this is reality
[2:49:03] all the things that you heard him say
[2:49:05] today
[2:49:07] or much of it was prophecy even when the
[2:49:11] prophet left
[2:49:13] and we thought
[2:49:15] excuse me I turned 80 this year
[2:49:18] I never thought I'd see 50 40 30.
[2:49:22] I heard brother Brown preach
[2:49:25] the marriage and divorce series
[2:49:27] when he passed we were ready to go then
[2:49:29] as a whole generation was prophecy
[2:49:33] you young men women here today
[2:49:36] you've heard it exactly the way the
[2:49:38] prophet said it in love in kindness and
[2:49:42] respect
[2:49:44] [Music]
[2:49:48] to thus saith the Lord
[2:49:51] the things that we've gone through and
[2:49:53] go through
[2:49:54] our only testing grounds proving that
[2:49:58] there comes a reality to every prophecy
[2:50:01] for it spoken when it's not yet reality
[2:50:04] listen to the things he said today about
[2:50:06] the world it wasn't that way 80 years
[2:50:09] ago
[2:50:10] but it's that way now it's not going to
[2:50:13] be it is that way look at the church
[2:50:15] world the religious World it wasn't that
[2:50:18] way
[2:50:18] 50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years but
[2:50:21] it is now
[2:50:23] there wasn't a bride collecting gathered
[2:50:25] around the world the way they are now
[2:50:27] around thus saith the Lord
[2:50:29] they've gone to individuals
[2:50:31] not what this man says what this man
[2:50:33] said what I say what brother aunt said
[2:50:35] it isn't that it wasn't brother Ron it's
[2:50:37] the message
[2:50:39] and the prophet knew it when he was here
[2:50:41] he knew he wouldn't see a lot of things
[2:50:43] he kept talking about him going
[2:50:45] he said I might not be here and I
[2:50:48] brother Ron that's true he said but you
[2:50:49] young men
[2:50:51] how I laid a hold of that
[2:50:54] how are they ahold of that for myself 28
[2:50:56] years old but you're going to walk very
[2:50:58] much alone
[2:51:00] you're not going to have all the
[2:51:01] trumpets sounding around you know all
[2:51:03] the brothers saying oh praise God move
[2:51:04] on move on you stay with this message

[2:51:15] this race is finished I want my body to
[2:51:18] turn into reality from this glory to the
[2:51:20] next Glory
