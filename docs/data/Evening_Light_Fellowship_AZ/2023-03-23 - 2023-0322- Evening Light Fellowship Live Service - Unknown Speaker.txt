bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we have sang the songs of Zion Lord we've worshiped you we've sensitized our hearts and our spirits and we're asking now Lord that by the foolishness of preaching that Souls would be saved lives would be encouraged the sick would be healed Lord that our lives would be changed and so we're putting our trust in you Lord for all things for where else would we go where else can we go Lord so to you we come this evening we give you our all our lives our hearts our minds and we ask that your name would be glorified we thank you Lord we love you bless your people we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this evening it's good to be gathered in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of Psalms uh 107 and verse 20. thank you musicians The Book of Psalms chapter 107. and verse 20 and it says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions notice what he sent he sent his word and he healed him amen Isaiah 53 and verse 5. very familiar portion of scripture Isaiah 53 and verse 5 and it says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities notice it didn't say his iniquities but our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed hallelujah what a promise Luke chapter 8 and verse 47. Luke chapter 8 and verse 47. and it says and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what caused she had touched him and how she was healed immediately amen you may have your seats this evening I would like to title my sermon this evening the great physician is here with the subject of Believers belief because putting Simplicity that's what believers do is Believers believe and as Believers what do we believe for We Believe for the impossible to be made possible we believe for God to come on the scene and to meet all of our needs no matter what the game Sayers may say no matter what the doctors may say no matter what anybody else may tell us Believers believe you know that's what we're good at right the unbeliever he'll say well I don't believe that well it's not for you to believe it because it's for believers so now as Believers we have a portion in the great drama of God to play and that's believing in the word of God Hallelujah so are you playing your part this evening what are we believing leave it word all things are possible to who to the unbelievers all things are possible to them who'd what who believe Hallelujah sometimes as a minister we get to pray before God and we wonder Lord what would you have us to minister to your people Lord Give Me A Channel give me a thought give me a a direction in which you would want us to minister on and I couldn't find the quote but I know brother Branham said it he said sometimes what a minister will do is he'll look across the congregation and he'll see the needs that's upon the people's lives and that's the inspiration that he'll preach upon if there's ever if we've ever had a need within our assembly of healing within our bodies it's at this very time I don't think of all the years that I've been here I've never seen so many sicknesses so many ailments so many heart attacks and and diseases and all these different things that's attacking this local assembly at this very time and I thought to myself there's no better time than to preach a sermon on the great physician is now here you say brother Stephen well why would you want to preach that do you want to preach it to make the people feel uh uh bad because they haven't received their healing yet quite the contrary because whatever we preach that is the fruit that's going to come forth from our ministering so if we begin to preach salvation guess what those who are amongst us who have never give their hearts to Christ they'll receive salvation it's no different with healing when there's a need of healing amongst us and we begin to preach on healing and the the divine power of Jesus Christ to heal the body guess what's going to happen because what does it do it ignites our faith that is my desire this evening that our faith level would go higher than it's ever been before it's not something that we have to work up it's not something that we have to make believe in it's just something that we have to preach which is the word it's not just any kind of word it's the spoken word of God and the word of God Is Spoken it has an effect Upon Our Lives Hallelujah these needs in our lives are actually opportunities for God to come on the scene nothing is impossible with God there's nothing that's in our lives in our mental Minds a sickness within our body a trouble within our family that is too difficult for God not to take care of why because we serve on almighty God who is greater he's greater than any sickness he's greater than any trial he's greater than any mountain we serve a God who is greater than anything that comes in our lives we are experiencing something within our assembly and I'm sure you can all agree that at one point it would have been uh when a cliche that when one member of the body suffers the rest of the body suffers it's very easy to say but this last probably since the beginning of the year you can feel it feel it in your spirit you can feel it in your heart you sense like a a heaviness for a better word to say that's amongst us and why is that it's not a it's not a heaviness because we are a defeated and an oppressed people it's a heaviness because the needs and the the issues that our friends and our family and loved ones are going through is burdensome to us because when one member of one of the body suffers the rest of us are feeling it it's no longer a cliche but it's a reality so what does it cause us now as a body of Believers it causes us to come together it causes us to pray one for another like we've never prayed before why because the burden is there like it never was before where does the burden come from it comes from God Almighty if God puts a burden on your heart for the person that's sitting next to you you better reach out and pray for that person why because perhaps God is using you as an intercessor for that person I'll wait until tomorrow don't put off until tomorrow what can be done today Hallelujah ah we get so complexed with life and uh uh uh you know well that person and and I don't even know that person and that's not nonsense when God places something on your heart let me tell you you better do it yes sir Hallelujah because perhaps God is wanting to use you as an individual not anybody else but you and he's putting it on your heart he woke you up at midnight well I'm too tired to pray he woke you up for a purpose he put that person on your heart for a purpose why because he's wanting to use you as an intercessor hallelujah what is this all doing it's playing your part in the local body that's the unsung heroes as the unsung heroes of laodiacia that's the unsung heroes of evening Light Fellowship those who are burdened in their hearts who aren't scared to get on their knees amen amen this is a shaking time where God is taking out of our lives a wood the hay and the stubble he's taken out of our Lives the trash of laodiacia because he's wanting us to come closer and have a greater relationship with him why is he shaken me because he wants you to come forth as pure gold he doesn't want the wood and the hay and the stubble of louder you see it to be mixed in with it but he wants it to be pure beaten goat Hallelujah Hallelujah now I realize as we get started on this this evening in this service that Divine Healing is a minor and it is not a major in the plan of God we realize that and we understand that now some will say brother Stephen you're you're preaching way back here in the first pull of brother Brown's Ministry brother Branham had three pulls and we're in the third pool and you're way back here preaching on the first pull of his ministry though that may be true that doesn't mean that we as Ministry cannot preach on the subject of Divine Healing because though he moved from the first pulled to the second pull it never done away with the first pull though he went from the second pull to the third pull it never done away with it completely though we have moved on in maturity to the spoken word it doesn't mean that we can't have faith for Divine Healing in our lives like the scripture says Hallelujah we realize that healing is still an attribute of God that is included within the finished work of calvary and because it was included in the work of Calvary it can never be taken out therefore as long as we are here we can preach Divine Healing as long as we don't major on the minor it's okay to be a minor once in a while as long as we're not majoring on it hahaha so just for a little time tonight what is time to God anyways for a little space of time for 45 minutes we're going to minor on a minor don't want to stumble some of you by saying we're gonna major on a minor 1956 here ye him brother Branham said no I want to say to you last night tonight was Evangelistic call friends Divine Healing is just a minor you can never major on a minor as I said salvation of the soul is much greater than Divine Healing hallelujah what is the use of Divine Healing if the soul is on its way to hell get this soul on its way to heaven get this Soul born again then we can kind of preach on the minor of Divine Healing why because we're not majoring on it beloved I wish above all the dumbass prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers and is in health glory amen yes sir he said Divine Healing was included in the new atonement because the old atonement had healing in it and the new ones are much better C than the old if the old one could furnish healing what about the new one but Divine Healing is not on the same basis as salvation when you're born again you get an immortal spirit and cannot die but when you're healed by Divine Healing you will get sick and die again Lazarus did and all the rest of them he even raised from the dead but it's the attribute of his resurrection notice that Divine Healing is the attribute of his resurrection because he is alive those attributes are still alive so because he is alive the things that he did back here he still does today because his attributes never change but it's the attribute of his resurrection and it's the earnest of our resurrection that we will see God said so now it's in the Bible why do you believe in Divine Healing because it's in the Bible and anything that's in the Bible we can believe it anything that's written within the scriptures not only can we believe it but we can take it and we can apply it to our lives Hallelujah my desire is this this evening that we might see the attributes of God within his scriptures that our faith could come to a level for those things which we are in need of let's bring our faith up a little bit higher because some of you think that you don't have faith and that's a lie and we're going to prove it tonight you do got faith you actually got plenty of Faith you've got more faith than what you think you know you got you actually use your faith unknowingly in other things so now it's just taken that channel of faith and applying it to a different uh place in our lives Hebrews 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must for must believe that he is you got to believe that God is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him Romans 10 verse 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so in order to have faith in a certain subject first of all we've got to hear it from the word of God because Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God so if we need to have faith and for a healing attribute within our bodies guess what we need to hear we need to hear what the Bible says about healing we need to hear what it says that our faith might be elevated to a place like it's never been before we've got to hear what the word of God says about this subject not what brother Stephen says about this subject but what the word says about this subject because we put our faith and our trust in the word amen all of you can agree to this that before you can have faith for salvation first of all you had to hear the word about salvation how could you know that you ever needed to be saved if no one ever told you how could you know that Jesus Christ uh uh Saint John 3 16 for Gods who loved the world that he give his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him they shall never perish but they shall have everlasting life if nobody never shared the scripture with you through the hearing of your ear you would never have come to the understanding that he died for your sins how can I know unless somebody tells me how do I know what the scripture says if I've never read it myself unless somebody speaks it to me you might not have caught it the first time that you heard it without being born again guess what you're on a Highway to Hell without having an experience with Jesus Christ guess what your life is going to be an absolute turmoil but when you accept Christ into your life guess what now you have an advocate before the father and you have a peace in your life that passes all of understanding you might not have caught it the first time you heard the sermon it might have taken years in sitting in the Pew but at one time you caught it at least I hope you caught it and if you haven't caught it yet you need to catch it yes sir yes sir it's time to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins what do I need to repent of you need to repent of being you you need to repent of your old carnal life not just coming to church not just saying prayers and paying your tithes but repenting and turning from your evil ways my we think uh in a message Church no one should need to repent might surprise us I gotta repent on a daily basis I don't have to ask God to if I'm saved on a daily basis but I need to repent on a daily basis that's why I'm preaching I know you need to repent on a daily basis you know what this message did this message brought us to a place you know the the Presbyterians and the methodists and the different ones they're always rushing to the altar every service oh I I want to be saved and I want to be saved and and I just want to be saved and I don't want to make no mistakes anymore but this message came and it gave us a balance for us to realize Who We Are it has given us a balance to where we realize I don't need to be asked I don't need to ask to be saved every day but I do need to repent every day and the closer we get with God the more we realize the more I need to repent the closer we get with God the more we realize I am a wretched miserable man that I am the closer you get with God the more you realize the more you need God Hallelujah so before we could believe in Salvation we had to hear the word first and when we heard the word at some point in our lives something happened it ignited a faith in our hearts where we realize because what is Faith it's a revelation of the word of God and we realized it by Revelation I need a savior and I need to repent of my sins what a revelation that is to us as the bride so important but let me say this if you have got Faith to believe that you're saved how many of you doubt that you're saved this evening I would say if some were honest there baby a couple that will raise their hands probably because I've never met God face to face quite yet which is okay your time is coming but how many of you are praying on a daily basis oh God save me God please save me I just need to be saved no we're repenting of the things that we've done wrong therefore we have faith in the finished work of Calvary for our salvation now I'm getting to something because a lot of people think they don't have faith but you have faith enough to say that you're a Christian can you say Amen you have faith enough to say that you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you've got the Holy Ghost you have faith enough excuse me you have faith enough to say that you believe the message of the hour you have faith enough to say that you're a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and you're trying to tell me you don't have faith you have faith enough to say that if you were to die this evening that you'd go to heaven you have faith enough to believe for your family and their salvation and then you let Satan tell you that you don't have faith you've got plenty of Faith you're just using it in a different avenue why because you have faith in the finished work now healing is part of the finished work we pray all the time God thank you for saving me thank you for setting me free thank you for what you've done for me we need to take that Avenue of Faith towards the healing of our bodies father thank you for how you've touched me thank you for my healing thank you for what you've done I may not recognize it yet in my body but at work is already finished we don't need to keep praying God please heal me please heal me but God thank you for what you've done thank you for touching my body thank you for touching my children that's speaking by faith in the word of God it's no different it's no different than thanking God for your salvation even though you make mistakes on a daily basis even if I feel sicker tomorrow we're still going to thank God for touching me because he's already touched you what is it that you're believing for this evening there's so many needs within our body it's time for us to start thanking God for what he's already done at Calvary and saying Lord the circumstance may not be good and the doctor May say it doesn't look good but your word says that by your stripes I am healed to buy your stripes my family is healed my children are healed the different people in my family are already healed I just gotta accept it just like we accepted salvation instead of having a I don't want to I'm not gonna say that instead of feeling sorry for ourselves and we got every right to feel sorry for ourselves sometimes according to the flesh man but why should we why should we if there's a promise that's written within the word of God that'll bring us out of our pity party that'll bring us out of feeling sorry for ourselves and into the Promised word of the hour you do got faith you do got faith to believe it's already within you it's already within the seed and what is happening with these situations it's bringing the life and the attributes of God out of the sea I'm going to read a quote where brother Branham says people say yeah with all things With God all things are possible but brother Branham says yeah but if with you all things are possible to you who would believe so this isn't something that we need to try to work up and we need to fast and pray and fast and pray no we just need to take God at his word just like we do on a daily basis for salvation we need to take that same faith and now channel it in a different direction little Josiah they said yeah yeah bad news bad news ain't going to be good it's not good it's not good sister Megan's I don't know 24 weeks or 30 weeks pregnant whatever it is oh bad news yeah thanks a lot I don't want to put any stress in your life but here you got some bad news yeah thanks it's not going to be good okay give me the worst case scenario always going to be in hospital this and that this and that and now look he's at home it's going to be 24-hour care you're never going to be in church come to church on a Sunday on the church on a Wednesday night what's happening it's little victories [Music] little victories may not happen all at once but a little Victory adds to a little Victory and a little Victory out to a little Victory it may not be easy at that time but a victory is a victory David little Theo was a victory it's a victory we've got people in the assembly they've got cancer and different things let me tell you God is our victory and his word will not fail us my mom's the same way dropped 18 pounds in a couple of months and and uh her stomach began to swell and everything and and stuff she's vomiting she's all she's sick so she goes gets blood tests done yeah you got cancer okay thanks a lot yeah well uh first of all it is uh let's get blood tests done eight weeks later they make you wait great thank you does my faith the world good and they say you got some abnormalities okay what is it it's cancerous okay praise the Lord and so my parents call me and they tell me and I'm thinking the last time my mom had cancer they called me and I say mom you're going to be fine well she ended up being fine so this time they call me son what do you think oh man say Mom it doesn't sound good because of your body and you're you're throwing up and you can't eat and you can't drink and these different things and they don't know what's going on with their what they don't know what where it is or what I said but we believe and a god of Miracles you see we can't our faith doesn't tell us just to put a blindfold on and to say this isn't real this isn't real get behind me Satan this isn't real it's real it's real but because it's real we believe in An Almighty God who is greater than any cancer cells that's within the body so we can acknowledge the truth that's happening but we also acknowledge God and his word and having faith in his word for this present stage of Our Lives finally we can acknowledge it but we'll dwell on the word of God rather than the doctors and what they say God is good I believe in the third pool Ministry of brother Branham I believe in speaking the word and I believe that it will be sovereignly given at times but I also believe the many people's faith is being stagnated because they're waiting for something to happen in that third pool Ministry now notice this let me ask you a question what if God give somebody else within the assembly The Sovereign spoken word to their need in their family how would you feel if somebody's dog was sick and here you are with a great need in your life and someone's dog was sick and God speaks to them say to this mountain say to the sickness that's within this dog to come out in the name of Jesus Christ and the dog is going to live how would you feel if somebody did if God sovereignly did that for someone else in their dog and not for you and your situation would you be jealous would you be mad would you lose faith in God God used that on a little fishy a little insignificant fishy and brother Branham said there was many a little child was laying within the hospital he said why would God chose to speak to that little fishy like that because he wants to show us that God cares about the little things God can do what he wants so now in the meantime while we're waiting we shouldn't be waiting in unbelief for something like that to happen there was other people on the mountain that day when brother Branham was hunting but God chose brother Brannon God may not choose any of us to speak the word like he did with brother Branham though he might but we should have faith in God's word the weather he uses us to speak the word to a situation or not we should still have faith in this Divine word of God that will never fail that our needs will be met anyways some people are waiting why wait well God if you'll just let me speak the word let me tell you we can speak the word from the very word itself that's what we're doing this evening we're speaking from the word of God we are forgetting that we still have to walk by faith and not by sight a lot of times we are not exercising our faith like we should be sure we're exercising it over here and we're thanking God over here but the needs that are over here in our lives how about once in a while we begin to exercise our faith in this side also stop asking and start believing faith is not believing that God cares all this is so good faith is not believing that God can but believing that God will oh Glory God will do it when I don't know but my faith tells me that it's going to happen he said brother Stephen is just just towards Divine Healing this is towards issues in your marriage you gotta load down good for nothing husband you have faith in God that God will turn his life around that God will put him on his back with his heels in the air let me tell you he'll turn around you got a wife that you feel is where she should be and submissive submit her to God will take care of it but you got to have faith in it oh I want a wife have faith in God he provides your wife at the right time I want to get married I want to have a hug yeah God will provide it in the right time just have faith Hallelujah what faith amen the second-handed robe this is a lengthy quote but it's very good uh 19 56 paragraph 76 brother Branham says a few weeks ago sister wood here and brother wood two bosom friends of ours here at the church I was in Michigan with my friends Leo and Gene we had left the Chicago meeting and went with some of their people for two days to go deer hunting with bows and arrows no my wrote back my wife had got a hold of me and she said pray for Miss Wood's mother a cancer is eaten off her face I never seen sister wood so alarmed she's weeping sister wood has always been a hero of Faith since God healed her boy of a crippled leg and healed her of TB and so forth but she had given down sounds a little bit like uh like John the Baptist doesn't it John was full of Faith until they put him in jail they put him in jail long enough to where he started to disbelieve that that what he knew was truth was really truth Allelujah some of us need to break out of the jail cell because the longer you're in the jail cell the longer you'll feel that it's not the truth God help us he said there at the room that night we prayed coming in Miss Wood said brother Branham we'll go over and we went to her mother which was in Louisville and she had a cancer on the side of her nose and the doctor had tampered with it and Scattered it till just a little ring the side of her nose and up just about an eighth of an inch from her eye just the bone lay in there done eating it just as fast as it could eat away go into the room and I knelt down I want to speak to her alone and I goes into the room to pray with the woman and while in the room I thought now notice this because I was I mentioned on on uh leaning on the third pool and speaking the word and just staying dormant right notice brother Branham did this very same thing with the gift in his life uh he said oh God if you'll just show me a vision of what's going to happen to the woman now notice now he's not walking by faith now he's walking about what he sees he said oh God just show me something about the woman so I can tell the people he said I miss Mr Miss Wood on the outside waiting to see what the vision would say but while I was there I got condemned I was condemned by waiting for a vision seemed like something referred back wasn't the calling what you need a vision when the promise is already been said so we don't need to wait for something that's a future event but just have promise and what the word of God says have faith and the promises of the word of God he had so conditioned himself to he was always seeing visions there was another quote I read where brother Branham said I haven't done a prayer line without having a vision in a very long time but I'm going to do it tonight he got so dependent upon the Visions where he was almost forgetting how to walk and Pray by faith God help us if that happened to the prophet it can happen to us God prank our conscience tonight to have faith Lord for the impossible because it's written greater is he that is within you than he who is in the world these works that I do shall ye do also now we're quoting the word and greater than these shall you do because I go unto my father greater is he that's within you and he that's within the world he said what you uh wasn't calling what you need a vision when the promises already been said so I knelt down and prayed no vision no nothing I'm all praying something just anchored on the inside the faith of the promise Hallelujah come back out Miss Wood when I told her about it she said did you see anything brother Brownell what did you see tell me what you seen I said I never exactly seen anything but I felt something that told me that his promise was true and he was going to do it and I believe that he's going to do it now he's walking by faith and in less than 24 hours the end of that cancer began to break away and the scab form over it cancers don't scab as you know unless it's dead so there it was now and the woman is healed and home what a wonderful Christ by keeping our eyes on the promise God said so so let it be done but when we are prayed for sometimes we go off and say well it wasn't done just immediately so maybe we better go back again oh no keep your eye on the promise God said so and that settles it that's all of it if God said so God is able to keep his promise or he would never make it how good is that we ought to let that anchor down within our souls this evening and said God promised it and he has never made a promise that he cannot keep because he is a promise keeper he is a Waymaker he is a cancer deliverer server he is a family restorer he is a holy ghost filler he is a Salvation Giver and he's a friend he sticks closer than a brother that's my friend you can depend on get around me long enough I'll let you down I could almost say that that's thus saith the Lord it's true stuff my wife ask my kids I'll let you down as a friend I'll let you down as a brother I'll let my wife down and she'll let me down but there's one in Our Lives who will never let us down Jesus Christ a friend who sticks closer than any brother and when you've got your eyes fixed on him let me tell you something it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter if brother Stephen fails you because your eyes aren't fixed on brother Stephen Your Eyes Are Fixed On Him and so if brother Stephen was ever to fall you would never fall because your eyes are on him keep your eyes on Christ keep your friendship with Christ Hallelujah it's about brother branham's Ministry the Holy Spirit was always trying to get things across to us when we say that brother Branham said we could almost say the holy spirit says our God is trying to say something through his Prophet especially when he says it multiple times in multiple services and over and over again the Holy Spirit has a channel in which he's trying to show us something it's not just because brother Branham has wanted to repeat the same things at each church but the Holy Spirit has a channel that he's recording on tape that there will be a people who will catch that channel for a certain time in history that we might catch what the spirit is saying through the Holy Spirit I feel was was always trying to tell us of Who We Are brother Brandon would use the story he would say you ain't no chickens in the barnyard he would he said you're not supposed to be clucking with the chickens in the chicken coop just because you're an eagle that was birthed under a chicken or under a head that doesn't mean that that's who you are the reason you feel odd to the world is because you are hard to the world it's because you're an eagle he would use the natural type of a donkey he said a donkey he don't know who his mama is he don't know who his poppy is but a thoroughbred horse he knows who his mom he is he knows who his daddy is what was he trying to tell us through these little examples he's trying to say you are not of this world you are of something greater and something higher time and time again he would use the story of the slave and so this slave brother Branham said way back they would buy and sell slaves at like a used car lot and so there was this one slave and here he was he was he worked harder than everybody else brother Branham said they didn't have to whip him to work and somebody came along they said I want that one that's the one I want he said he's not for sale well what makes him different you'd feed them a little bit better food no he eats with everybody else does he get a better night's sleep does he sleep in a better quarters no he sleeps with the rest of the slaves well what's so different about this guy what's the difference in him why does he act different why does he talk different why does he carry himself differently he said well I I thought the same thing and he said I come to find out that he's the son of a king now this story when I when I got to thinking about this today I got to thinking he's the son of a king therefore he acted differently he talked differently because he knew that he came from Royal Blood he came from a Royal bloodline therefore he was different but the main difference in this guy was this that he had a revelation of who he was he had a revelation of who his family was he had a revelation of who his dad he was and because he knew who he was and where he came from he had a different way of thinking than everybody else what is the point in this little story we are different because we have a different father we are different because we have a royal blood that flows through our veins therefore our mindset is different when it comes to the word of God therefore our mindset is different when we are given bad news why because we know where we came from we know who our daddy is and if we are to ask our daddy for bread would he give us a stone therefore we have confidence and asking our Papa God for whatever need it is in our lives because we know we are Sons and Daughters of God you see the importance of knowing who you are you see the importance of knowing where you came from and where you're going back to because when you realize that now you have confidence in the word because he is the word but if you're not sure if you're not sure where you came from if you're not sure who you are if you're not sure of your identity in Christ you're not going to be sure about the promises that lay within this word if you're not sure about the promises that lays within this will if you don't know who you are and the will is read how do you know what's yours has got to be for somebody else because I didn't I didn't hear I didn't hear my name I I didn't hear it I heard somebody else's name but I I hope my name is in there hope ain't good enough but by faith we realize by a new birth experience I'm by your life being changed that something has happened and you know who you are and the more you listen to that eagle cry the more you realize where you came from and the more you realize I don't want to feed in the chicken coop no more but I want to Feast upon the fresh carcass of the word it all boils down to knowing your identity in Christ that when this will is read Because this is his will you realize that every Divine promise that is written within this book is mine as for my family that is for my loved ones therefore I'm going to accept it and I'm going to say Thank you Lord thank you many of you have ever been left something in a will raise your hands some people did you say thank you this is mine and I deserve it they worked their whole life for it but I'm getting their inheritance and it's mine I deserve it it's not how we acted say wow I didn't deserve this I didn't work for this house I didn't work for this money I didn't do anything for it I was just associated with the one that paid the price I was just associated with the one who paid the price and therefore by Grace they put my name on the will and because my name is on the will I accept it and I say thank you Lord so it is when I see something written within the will that pertains to me I say thank you Lord foreign thank you Lord the bride now is Awakening to who she really is she's realizing that she's bone of his bone and she's flesh of his flesh she is as part of a part of him and no one can take that away from us so what does it do when you realize who you are and where you came from and that you're a part of God and you came from Christ and you always were a part of him it puts an anchor in your heart and it makes you think that all things are possible to those who will believe so all things are possible to me because I am a believer and my life is testifying that I am a believer and therefore I'm believing because the promises are left to me when you know who you are there's no more being tossed to and fro but your faith is anchored in the word 1950 and who was God brother Brown says Joshua stopped the son is that true somebody said all things are possible with God nothing impossible but all things are possible to you also nothing impossible to them to believe all things are possible brought right down and made you if you just know who God was who is he he's my father that's who he is he's the one that birthed me he's the one that put me here for this for this period in this space of time he ain't something so far off that can't be touched but he's a God my father my friend he's my lover well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid that holy ghost-born men doesn't realize their Authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church I'll give unto you unto thee the kingdom the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven everybody said amen whatsoever you lose will be loosed I give you power over serpents don't let it die down over all kinds of diseases oh everything [Music] nothing should so harm you listen to this exercise your faith he says Let it Loose let God have his way God will grant it to you don't let loose on your faith for salvation only but Let it Loose in the other areas of your life Let it Loose brother Branham said and God will grant it to you why because God honors faith how do I Let it Loose thank him before it comes to pass say well what if I don't feel like it well sometimes you don't feel like you're saved but you thank them that you're saved anyways you ain't lying when you tell them thank you for a promise thank you for a promise that you've already that you've already committed that you're going to fulfill thank you God for it he ain't lying you're speaking by faith before we can have faith for healing we first first must believe that his promises are true within the word just like you do for salvation Faith begins where the will of God is made known you heard about salvation and your faith began we're hearing about healing this is where our faith begins Faith must rest on the will of God Alone and not in our desires are in our wishes as the musicians come here are some scriptures in the will of God concerning healing we've just touched the surface of this stuff what do we do tonight we're building your faith we're building your faith and we're going to show you these four or five scriptures of what Jesus did while he was here on Earth and he's still here on Earth and because he is here his attributes are the same and his works are the same and they change not Mark 6 verse 13. and they cast out many devils and Anointed with oil many that were sick we got the scriptures Brothers and healed them Matthew 4 Mark 6 verse 13. and they cast out many devils and Anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them Matthew 4 verse 24. and as Fame went throughout all of Syria and they brought on to him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments you can go ahead and start playing and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the palsy and he healed him I want to ask you something is there anything too difficult for gar whether it's palsy whether it's Devils whether it's lunatic whether it's diabetes you put whatever name you want there there is nothing that is too difficult for Papa God Matthew chapter 8 verse 16 when the even was come they brought on to him many that were possessed with devils he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick Psalms 107 verse 20 he sent his word and he healed him and he delivered them from their destructions Isaiah 53 verse 5 what a scripture there was a reason why he was wounded for our transgressions there was a reason why he was bruised for our iniquities why the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed there's no you will be healed there's no maybe there's a possibility but to the believer all things are possible and by his stripes we are already healed it's not something that we're looking off to in the future but it is something that is right now that is present amongst us because his word is an eternal word with eternal promises let's Stand Together why don't you go home this evening [Music] do a little study on healing look it up what does the Bible say what is promised to me in this hour of of healing within my body what has promised to me in this hour according to my to my friends and my family and my mom and my dad and my siblings what are my promises we just have faith in the promised word you know God made a covenant and he swore by himself because he could swear by no greater foreign he tried to have a covenant with man before if you'll do this I'll do this but it always failed but he came to a point in his I don't know on his great Plan of Redemption it is time it is time that I depend no more upon man but I'm going to swear by myself do you know that every promise that is written within this word is stamped with God's signature haha Hallelujah it is signed with red and it signed Papa God so on this checkbook brother Branham said you have a blank check in front of you with an un uh unlimited amount within the bank account and whatever it is you need to sign it on the checkbook it's already stamped it's already been paid it's written in in with red ink and it's stamped with God's signature all we have to do is realize what it is we're looking for what it is we need in our lives and say papa God you promised and your promises do not fail therefore I stand as a son and a daughter of the Living God not upon my desires not upon my wants but upon the promises of your word you made the Covenant his word says train me now saith the Lord [Music] don't be scared don't be scared of rejection God will never reject you God will not reject a believer because there are as much a part of him as he is a part of himself so God could not slay Sarah because she was a part of Abraham [Music] God cannot slay the bride in this hour because she's born of his bone and flesh of his flesh therefore whatever we ask our husband oh oh King I'm So Unworthy to come before you but I didn't choose you chose me and because you chose me I know you'll never leave me and because you'll never leave me I believe that your promises are true and so here I stand [Music] he needs to sit down your own desires and your own wants your own I think it should happen this way of nonsense come to God with a clear conscience repent of your sins you want to get something from God approach [Music] repent of your sins make it right before because you know when you're doing that you know what God is doing it's his goodness towards you so now the goodness of God wasn't to do it leads us to repentance and now we're covered we have faith in the word of this day where brother Branham said the Clorox bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't take away sins it doesn't just cover them vanished it's vanished it went back to where it was before it was something it never was you say well I did it in your flesh you did but you're not your flesh when we have faith to believe when we come with a repenting heart and our sins are done away with her ain't just covered but we're Justified when we come to God with a clear conscience that there's nothing in our lives that's hindering us from our prayers being answered now you come before God and see what happens may you come before God when you have approached them the right way through the blood when you've laid yourself down and you've repented and you've and you've softened your heart you've softened your spirit you've took time out of your morning you've took time out of your evening and you got real serious with God Lord you're such a good God Lord I Thank you that you made a covenant and you swore by yourself because you swore by yourself Lord because you could swear by no greater we know that your word which is you in letter form can never let us down father I ask that you would help us to exercise our faith Lord we're so good at exercising it in certain areas of our lives but other areas not so good I ask father that you would lead us into those paths father that we can exercise ourselves so we can exercise our faith Onto You Lord believing for all things because your word says that all things are possible to those who we believe Lord we're believers and we do what believers do best We Believe Lord we believe and we ask that not only will you help our unbelief because unbelief is sin I ask it you do away with it do away with the sin Lord that so easily besets us and
