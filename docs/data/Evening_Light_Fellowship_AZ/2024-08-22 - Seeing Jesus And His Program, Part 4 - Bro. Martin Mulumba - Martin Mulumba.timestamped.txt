[23:38] book of 2 King chapter
[23:41] 2 verse
[23:49] 11-4 and it came to pass as they still
[23:52] went on and talked and that behold there
[23:56] appeared a chariot of Fire and horse of
[23:59] fire and departed them from uh departed
[24:02] them both Ascender and Elijah went up by
[24:05] a worldwind into heaven and Elisha saw
[24:08] it and he cried my father my father The
[24:11] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[24:13] thereof and he saw him and he saw him no
[24:17] more and took hold of his whole own of
[24:20] his own clothes and rent him into two
[24:24] pieces he took up also his man the manle
[24:27] of Elijah that fell upon him from him
[24:30] and went back and stood by the bank of
[24:33] Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah
[24:36] that fell from him and smoked the waters
[24:39] and said where is the Lord God of Elijah
[24:42] and when he also had smitten the water
[24:46] the waters they departed hither and
[24:48] thither and Elisha went over may the
[24:52] Lord bless the reading of his word you
[24:54] may be
[24:55] seated may God uh once again bless you
[24:59] tonight uh it's uh a privilege to be in
[25:03] the house of the Lord thank you brother
[25:05] Ron for the confidence and also the
[25:08] church for making it to the service
[25:12] tonight
[25:14] uh we are still uh carrying on with uh
[25:19] seeing Jesus and his program uh want to
[25:23] take uh tonight's service as a elas
[25:26] ministry as a Crossing Point uh between
[25:30] uh the first part of uh covering
[25:33] communism in the land also uh under
[25:37] jer's Ministry and to get into
[25:41] elas because we understand uh that God's
[25:45] program is still the same in all shape
[25:47] and forms and we take it from
[25:51] many uh types and
[25:55] shadows uh when uh tonight's service
[25:59] preparation I had to finish up uh it was
[26:02] a little bit different I said I'm not
[26:05] used
[26:06] to this type of him moving over me
[26:11] so you can tell I'm a little
[26:14] nervous uh it's the first time I don't
[26:17] know if uh that's his way of giving me
[26:20] my birthday or
[26:21] something we'll uh we'll see how how
[26:24] things will go by his grace because we
[26:28] are understand that uh many uh times
[26:33] when we dealing with the word is not
[26:35] human ways of doing things but at times
[26:38] we also get used to the way he moves and
[26:43] uh you become acquainted you know that
[26:45] hey when he's moving from the right it's
[26:47] because he wants to do this but then
[26:50] when he start moving a little bit
[26:52] different coming a little bit in the
[26:53] center he said well I need to find a
[26:56] scripture for it but by his grace uh
[27:00] we're looking forward uh to what he has
[27:03] for us uh also want to take the
[27:05] opportunity to thank all of you uh for
[27:10] everything that you have been for me all
[27:13] the invitations and uh uh the trust and
[27:18] uh respect and uh everything that you do
[27:23] in the background unheard and unseen
[27:26] from the church may God reach bless
[27:29] you uh because are some of the areas
[27:33] that you invited me I said well I'm
[27:35] quite a a young man I don't think I
[27:37] deserve this but you've done that
[27:41] inviting me over may God richly bless
[27:44] you uh all the feedbacks and everything
[27:47] that uh
[27:49] you um the way you're receiving the word
[27:53] and at times like you know you get off
[27:56] the pull pit you think that hey I should
[28:00] have said this and but by his grace he
[28:02] comes all over you and you know you
[28:05] start ministering to me too I believe
[28:08] we'll just uh keeping moving forward
[28:10] with the language the way he wants it to
[28:12] come forward by his grace uh tonight
[28:16] we'll be speaking about
[28:18] Elisha and I'll be also
[28:21] uh speaking a little bit about myself by
[28:25] his grace because I've Been Told told
[28:28] that uh I'm a little bit of a Myster man
[28:32] to to to uh to many you know I I just
[28:38] have uh this background of uh when I'm
[28:41] on the pulpit it's not it's not about me
[28:45] you know but then you understand that uh
[28:50] cultures are different you know cultures
[28:53] are different and
[28:55] uh sometimes uh you just used to eat
[28:59] chickens with bones and then you go
[29:01] somewhere else they tell you remove the
[29:03] bones you know so put a little bit of a
[29:07] smile
[29:08] and uh speak to the people relax and all
[29:12] that so you know we take that into
[29:15] consideration uh so it also like you
[29:18] know felt that it just happened that you
[29:20] know it is my birthday and uh to also
[29:24] give the church a little bit of uh
[29:26] background of who I am because because I
[29:28] don't usually do it when I'm behind the
[29:30] pulpit and also that he also comes along
[29:34] with uh elious Ministry just as the
[29:38] crossing point
[29:39] between um communism and uh everything
[29:43] that goes forward uh by God's grace uh
[29:46] will'll uh try to unveil as much as
[29:48] possible because I wanted to have a
[29:51] little bit of a longer Ser service but
[29:53] he said like no no go this way so if I
[29:56] just take 20 minutes you understand
[29:58] understand so by his grace but if I go
[30:00] longer you also understand let's just
[30:03] keep balance you know uh in the book of
[30:06] uh
[30:07] Elisha uh we see that Elisha represents
[30:12] the
[30:13] bride in this uh last hour that as we've
[30:16] been covering upon uh
[30:19] communism we see that uh the word uh
[30:24] hide these things in Simplicity the
[30:26] prophet says in question and answer sir
[30:29] uh he says uh you know he said like you
[30:31] know to prove my point I'll show you
[30:34] that you know this communism uh he's a
[30:37] spirit and he's something that is among
[30:40] people of all backgrounds I never had
[30:43] never seen that quote or I probably have
[30:46] listened to the tape but never uh pay
[30:49] attention to that quote uh he showing
[30:52] how communism came into the land uh and
[30:56] other scriptures that are found today
[30:58] you say like you know communism is a
[31:00] spirit and when it's a spirit you know
[31:03] you can just take a hold of one uh part
[31:07] of the land or one person and tie that
[31:09] hand to them you know but by his grace
[31:13] uh he was uh we've been able to see that
[31:17] communism as he comes along he came into
[31:22] the land with a false hope telling
[31:24] people hey you'll become this just like
[31:27] in the garden of
[31:28] Eden showing them that a you will uh
[31:32] stand uh you will become like God you'll
[31:35] be just like you know the way God is but
[31:38] they didn't know that what they were
[31:40] already that's what God had made them to
[31:43] be but
[31:45] nevertheless uh God in his Mercy under
[31:48] Elijah's Ministry he brought uh Elisha
[31:53] uh he gave him the vision about the work
[31:55] ahead when he had for all the Jezebel
[31:59] religion he brought him under in the
[32:01] cave and he gave him and said hey you're
[32:04] going to anoint Elisha je and the other
[32:08] one in your stad because you're going to
[32:10] leave the Earth upon the time that he
[32:14] came at the time of a planting of new
[32:17] seed he found Elisha in a certain place
[32:21] and
[32:24] Elisha found himself that he was under
[32:27] this man's ministry as the bride is
[32:30] under Elisha's Ministry in these last
[32:32] days
[32:34] Elisha thought it was good for him to
[32:38] offer sacrifices in order for him to go
[32:41] and separate himself from his parent and
[32:44] follow Elisha
[32:47] Elijah um we see that under every man
[32:51] that ever came to God the first starting
[32:54] point is the blood without shedding of
[32:58] the blood there's no remission of
[33:01] sin all of us when we came to the
[33:04] message that's our first step we come by
[33:06] listening to the word and we are
[33:08] convinced and then we are concerned to
[33:11] come and be baptized and to surrender
[33:14] under the Lord Jesus Christ when we come
[33:17] under such great privilege uh we find
[33:21] that there's now a whole journey
[33:24] ahead and as Elisha was walking along
[33:28] brother bam says in the message Elijah
[33:30] and
[33:31] Elisha he said uh I can see Elisha
[33:35] watching him every move he made that's
[33:38] the only way he was ever going to get
[33:41] the blessing that uh the blessing he is
[33:44] when he washed him because along the way
[33:48] all of us as we are walking and we are
[33:51] um
[33:52] Believers uh especially in this last
[33:55] hour that uh We've come up to the
[33:59] understanding and the knowledge that hey
[34:01] Bam have made so many mistakes and all
[34:05] these things but then I want to draw the
[34:08] church attentions that Elisha has a
[34:11] Ministry the same way that Elijah had a
[34:14] Ministry but then Elisha's Ministry
[34:17] could not be enacted until Elisha was of
[34:21] the Earth but then prior for uh Elisha's
[34:25] Ministry to be enacted it had to be
[34:28] under Elisha's Ministry and the prophet
[34:31] says that you know this is the guy who
[34:34] was going out to sit under his ministry
[34:36] and watch him in everything that he
[34:39] did and the Elisha's blessing was tied
[34:44] to Elijah's Ministry and everything that
[34:47] Elijah was going to Elisha was going to
[34:50] do to do that's what Elisha was going to
[34:53] do and many times so you finding a
[34:56] message that the prophet calls Elisha
[34:58] Elijah and Elijah Elisha because many
[35:02] time this that's where the whole
[35:05] separation between the two seeds comes
[35:07] into play because the two spirits in the
[35:10] framework of the church it's either it's
[35:12] going to repeat the same thing or it's
[35:15] only going to be a whole another thing
[35:18] not something of 99% of the truth but
[35:21] the entire truth but then many times
[35:25] that we find ourselves that we become so
[35:27] knowable one would say to me well you
[35:30] know I've listened to the message have
[35:33] worked so many years in the message have
[35:36] uh devoted my life in the message but I
[35:38] came to find out that the TR the message
[35:40] is not the
[35:41] truth well if the message is not the
[35:44] truth that means that Elijah is not the
[35:46] it does not have the truth that means
[35:49] that every single person before him does
[35:52] not have the truth because Elijah
[35:54] preached like Paul and Paul preached
[35:57] like
[35:58] uh Moses and Moses preached like Adam so
[36:02] that means like you know all that
[36:04] pedigree all of them those people are
[36:06] wrong that means that you know whoever
[36:09] came into the Garden of Eden was also
[36:11] wrong that means all of us here we are
[36:13] also under false
[36:17] truth understanding that our blessings
[36:21] is tied to a certain
[36:24] linage we are not just birth out of out
[36:27] of out of the ordinary or out of uh by
[36:31] chance that say like you know I'll go by
[36:33] myself and find the truth you can't find
[36:36] the truth by yourself because the
[36:39] Pharisees and Sadducees came in front of
[36:42] the truth looked at the truth and they
[36:44] called it
[36:45] Bible and this last hour it is the same
[36:48] way that Elisha is tied and connected
[36:52] with Elijah and he said that you know
[36:55] everything that we are to do the way to
[36:59] dress the way to talk the way to conduct
[37:01] our family has to come through Elijah
[37:05] and if Elijah has not preached the
[37:07] entire truth then he is the most
[37:11] deceitful person that we have known in
[37:13] this last
[37:14] hour one would say like you know but we
[37:17] don't have such a scripture in the
[37:19] message regarding this regarding uh long
[37:23] skirt or cutting your hair in a man
[37:25] whole another yes that's the reason why
[37:29] you have to sit under Elijah's Ministry
[37:31] before you enact your own
[37:34] Ministry because that's why brother bam
[37:36] saying that before you go into your
[37:38] ministry meaning on the pulpit get
[37:41] married or whatsoever you need to go and
[37:44] find yourself have that back uh back of
[37:46] the desert experience so Elijah also
[37:50] started
[37:51] following Elijah along along the way we
[37:55] see that even myself uh being born just
[37:58] like you know all most of most of us
[38:01] young people born in the message grew up
[38:03] in the
[38:05] message it came a time where my parents
[38:09] you know they will take us to church
[38:11] just like anybody else take us to church
[38:14] and said you know after service what did
[38:16] the pastor preach oh okay this becomes
[38:20] an issue
[38:21] now you come back home you have to have
[38:24] your notes written down so that you can
[38:27] just ify your presence in the
[38:30] church and as we we going ahead then the
[38:34] teenagers ages start kicking in then you
[38:37] start having now double you become
[38:40] double-minded why do do the parents call
[38:43] me to go to church and why do the pastor
[38:46] preach this way and why all these things
[38:49] and along the along the life Journey we
[38:53] came to the point was like well I
[38:56] believe the parents are just ftic
[38:59] ICS because that's all I knew because
[39:02] you used to it they play the TS at home
[39:06] you go to church and that's the
[39:07] environment you know you never been to
[39:09] all other churches then I took the
[39:12] courage now to start listening to
[39:14] everybody
[39:16] else I'll go along the street and they
[39:18] will send me go get some bread around
[39:22] the corner at 7:00 a.m. and I'll show up
[39:24] at 12: 1:00 a.m. 1:00 p.m. why because I
[39:27] went to another church and I wanted to
[39:29] hear what do do they have before going
[39:32] to school I'll be stopping by somebody
[39:35] along the street will be preaching and
[39:37] I'll be like you know standing there
[39:38] I'll never forget one and this guy was
[39:41] uh in a typ of a meeting and he wanted
[39:44] to he was in sort of uh Discerning
[39:47] people's uh uh needs and
[39:50] things oh I see somebody going to the
[39:52] United States and all this and then all
[39:54] they said like what about me they speak
[39:56] to me too
[39:58] discern my life too how come you
[40:00] Discerning everybody else I come here
[40:02] every single all of your meetings and
[40:05] nothing is happening so is Elijah's
[40:08] Ministry at some point most of us grown
[40:13] young old we can find ourselves in the
[40:15] same situation we come to church for a
[40:18] certain purpose probably because my
[40:20] husband Tes me to church but we are not
[40:23] convinced about what we are doing
[40:26] yet the make make us wear long skirts
[40:29] and not cut our head just because maybe
[40:32] because I am Somebody's Daughter
[40:35] somebody's son and I don't want to chish
[40:37] my parents image in the
[40:40] church but nevertheless we having this
[40:43] outward appearance but we are not
[40:46] convinced yet about what is this message
[40:49] is all about we don't even understand
[40:52] what is the message to begin with and
[40:54] elishah sitting under Elijah's Ministry
[40:58] as the prophet say I can see Elisha
[41:01] watching him every move he made glory be
[41:05] to God that once upon a time down the
[41:07] road the parents saw it was neat for me
[41:10] to leave the city because the city was
[41:12] just too much I had the city on my
[41:14] shoulders and I had to be relocated to a
[41:18] different area glory be to God that
[41:21] under such a Ministry that I was exposed
[41:24] uh in those days the brother was
[41:27] gracious enough to open up to me and by
[41:31] his grace he found me one time uh in the
[41:36] church uh I never I'll never forget the
[41:38] book I was probably on the third row of
[41:40] the church was not a church uh a uh a
[41:43] service day I just sat in there and I
[41:45] went to his uh his table or office and I
[41:49] took the book and I one of the books and
[41:52] it was talking about drugs and how
[41:54] coffee is a drug and how tea is a drug I
[41:56] say oh
[41:57] oh so the only arresting people who are
[42:00] taking weeds what about those who are
[42:02] taking coffee they should also everybody
[42:04] should be arrested and as I was digging
[42:07] in the book he stepped up to me and he
[42:10] gave me
[42:12] leadership I started reading leadership
[42:15] started reading
[42:18] leadership and before I know it I was on
[42:20] the
[42:21] Altar and from that time to this day
[42:24] this has been my life Journey
[42:28] I never understood
[42:31] everything not everything was clear in
[42:34] my mind right but one thing was true to
[42:38] me was that hey this is
[42:42] it I do not understand
[42:45] everything then I started asking
[42:48] questions Pastor why this why do we we
[42:52] this then you turn up to be Martin
[42:54] you're going to finish the entire
[42:55] message with questions
[42:58] I said well probably like I said why but
[43:02] you supposed to be the
[43:03] pastor you supposed to have all the
[43:06] answers many times we look to the man of
[43:10] God in those manners
[43:12] too I have to call the pastor who's
[43:15] going to give me an answer on this I'll
[43:18] have to call this here just as elishah
[43:20] was
[43:21] doing he said I watched him every single
[43:25] move that Elijah did the also you said
[43:29] like you know tie this way Pence this
[43:33] way skirt this way every single move but
[43:37] it was not an
[43:40] experience he was following I was
[43:44] following but then until that point I
[43:47] wouldn't say that I had received the
[43:49] Holy Ghost but I knew that this is my
[43:52] life this is my journey right then I
[43:55] took the seven Church age book then I
[43:58] started
[44:00] digging I had a little bit of a
[44:02] background because I grew up in the
[44:04] message they speak about this they speak
[44:07] about that one time then I went to
[44:09] school my teacher would ask me said I
[44:12] was wearing the cloud on my on my shirt
[44:16] he said if they ask you this what is
[44:19] this what are you going to answer I had
[44:20] no
[44:23] answer why are you wearing skirt the way
[44:26] you wearing
[44:28] oh it's because our church does
[44:30] it why don't you have a
[44:33] girlfriend oh my father will will not
[44:36] allow that to
[44:37] happen why do you do what you do oh
[44:40] because uh everybody in our church does
[44:43] that but it's not a conviction yet it's
[44:47] not a revelation yet and such a person
[44:51] might also have a Ministry but does not
[44:55] even know what is this is all
[44:58] about Elisha was standing there looking
[45:02] at every single thing that Elijah was
[45:04] doing we look at our parents we look at
[45:07] our fathers our pastors and we know
[45:10] where to find the
[45:11] quotations because I knew if we we if we
[45:15] speak about woman here I know I have to
[45:18] go into the church order book I knew
[45:21] where all these things were but it was
[45:23] not a conviction
[45:25] yet as young people we face that
[45:28] challenge but it is also God's program
[45:31] for our
[45:32] lives because he has to take us from our
[45:36] Earthly journey into that Heavenly
[45:39] Journey but then before all all of us we
[45:42] are
[45:43] called regardless of our spiritual
[45:46] growth to be under a certain leadership
[45:49] to take us into the next stage amen and
[45:52] he said all the blessings he says keep
[45:55] your eyes on Christ don't look to how
[45:58] sick you are and what the doctor said
[46:01] look at what Christ said keep your eyes
[46:04] your eye right there believe what he
[46:06] said his words are true and as we are I
[46:11] was going through along this life
[46:14] journey I found myself that you know
[46:17] this is it I found what what my heart
[46:20] has been longing
[46:21] for because this is what I've been going
[46:25] to church but this is no more Church
[46:26] church for me this is no more just a
[46:29] place where I go I see other young
[46:32] people this is not a place where I come
[46:34] and say like you know I am in the
[46:36] message then experiences after
[46:39] experiences then I went back home and my
[46:42] parents couldn't understand what
[46:44] happened to me I said what happened like
[46:47] you know this guy has changed this guy
[46:49] doesn't go out anymore he stays there in
[46:51] his room all day and he's praying he's
[46:53] reading what has happened to him then
[46:57] the news went across because you know
[46:59] when you have a a a energetic son who
[47:03] turns very tame and all this everybody
[47:07] noes notices that what happened to him
[47:10] you know oh well well he went uh we sent
[47:13] him by this pastor and say and the
[47:15] parents started bringing the children
[47:17] and said well what do I
[47:20] have what do I have to give to them why
[47:23] are you bringing them to me
[47:27] why am I
[47:28] here what is happening to me yesterday
[47:32] nobody wanted to have the children
[47:35] around me but then all of a sudden but I
[47:38] couldn't understand what that happened
[47:39] in my
[47:41] life so is a son is born in the
[47:45] house so is some of us coming to the
[47:51] message the atmosphere that we sitting
[47:55] under is a drift liting us from our
[47:58] Earthly into the Heavenly but at times
[48:01] it doesn't just click to our eyes
[48:04] because it's not an intellectual thing
[48:08] because it's not about reading the
[48:10] message because it's not about knowing
[48:13] how many quotations it's not about
[48:16] giving the right answers to
[48:19] everything but then when there's an
[48:22] experience to somewhere then now
[48:25] something internally start happening
[48:28] that you can't explain with your mind
[48:31] just as I said that you know what I
[48:33] experience today is something different
[48:35] than all the previous years that I've
[48:37] had
[48:39] amen and under these
[48:43] constant anointing I find myself oh
[48:47] there are Jehovah Witnesses outside can
[48:49] you come and help us
[48:52] because the abundance of the from the
[48:55] abundance of the heart so the mouth
[48:58] speak but then I found myself speaking
[49:01] and giving all these
[49:04] detailed lectures if I say of the
[49:07] message in school and at home and in
[49:10] family and everything without even
[49:13] realizing that this was my
[49:16] Ministry this is what I was called
[49:20] under that's why each one of us
[49:23] especially young people or grown where
[49:27] whenever the Lord comes into our lives
[49:30] he wants us to have to enact to be un to
[49:34] have the understanding that our ministry
[49:37] is about to kick off right amen he
[49:41] called The Prophet The Prophet wouldn't
[49:42] listen he said I have called you and you
[49:45] wouldn't go where about you have you
[49:47] called me I have called you and you
[49:49] wouldn't
[49:51] go it wasn't for the prophet was just
[49:54] like you know I just want to be like the
[49:55] rest of the boys
[49:58] I just want to go and smoke and and have
[50:00] a girlfriend like everybody else but
[50:04] under that
[50:06] anointing it just couldn't help
[50:09] it until the Lord started pushing things
[50:12] around him for him to understand they
[50:15] hey I have called you for this
[50:18] purpose as of as as the human being I
[50:21] wanted to be a farmer I had all my life
[50:24] planned out I I'll be planting corn in
[50:27] the South selling it to the West taking
[50:30] the product I'll take from the north and
[50:32] bring it to the east I planned out my
[50:35] whole life then he said no that's not
[50:39] your
[50:41] life it took me and remove me all that
[50:44] production that I did from my first uh
[50:47] uh field I sent it away and I sold it
[50:50] and stuff and all the money was
[50:54] stolen why because I he had a work to do
[50:58] with me he has a work to do with every
[51:02] one of us it's only by his choice it's
[51:07] what he wants to do and that's what is
[51:09] going to happen regardless of how much
[51:12] we want to push our own agenda we just
[51:15] going to find out that even the prophet
[51:17] would say he say if I had known I would
[51:21] have not wasted my the first 20 years of
[51:23] my life I would have committed it to to
[51:25] serve him and until then when we find
[51:27] ourself in that spot then we look behind
[51:31] said why did I lose all my
[51:33] life all this time and I should have
[51:36] served him why by the time you we come
[51:39] to discover the purpose of Our Lives we
[51:43] zero in in that point our life is the
[51:46] best life ever job cannot replace it
[51:51] Church cannot replace it family cannot
[51:54] buy it to you nothing in this world will
[51:57] be able to give it to
[52:00] you if this doesn't make sense to us
[52:04] it's only until we get in that area then
[52:08] you find yourself like you know what
[52:10] have I been
[52:12] doing because Isaiah looked up to the
[52:15] king and said I want to be like the king
[52:18] I see the political figures in the land
[52:20] I want to be like them why how can I
[52:25] become like him but then until he
[52:27] started seeing the destruction and the
[52:29] fall of the king then the Lord lifted
[52:32] him up after being lifted up he had a
[52:36] six W he saw the the the angel the the
[52:39] angels with six
[52:41] wings coming under under such
[52:44] Ministry he found himself like you know
[52:47] hey I found the
[52:49] place what I've been looking for in all
[52:52] this time I was always aspiring to
[52:55] something great
[52:58] our sisters we aspire to something great
[53:02] oh I want to be like the Kardashians
[53:04] because at this stage of our journey
[53:07] that's what we see to be
[53:10] great I want to be like this other
[53:13] fellow it's because we look at them as
[53:15] being something
[53:16] great but then until now that Earthly
[53:21] Veil is torn before our face and we are
[53:24] lifted up in the heavenly then our eyes
[53:28] perception of life
[53:31] changes and the prophet says what is
[53:34] that it says um the absolute the woman's
[53:37] absolute was the prophet the prophet
[53:40] absolute was God and together with the
[53:42] word I am the resurrection and life I
[53:45] see the power of God the Creator can do
[53:48] all she rise up again the baby
[53:52] amen the woman and when the child when
[53:56] when Elisha when the brother when the
[53:59] sister when we come to that
[54:02] understanding into the Heavenly places
[54:05] it said like I have found the absolute
[54:08] amen because the absolute was not
[54:12] something so far away the absolute was
[54:15] just next to them and the absolute was
[54:18] the prophet and behind that Prophet was
[54:21] the word and allog together now he found
[54:24] the absolute he said I'll stick under
[54:27] this such Ministry yes but then when we
[54:31] come into that absolute we start finding
[54:36] errors then it's no more the
[54:39] absolute because regardless of how much
[54:42] the world can become smart and find all
[54:45] the issues in the message and left and
[54:47] right they will still end up with an
[54:49] absolute to some degree that's right
[54:52] it's either the mind is the absolute or
[54:55] the word is the
[54:58] absolute because leaning to our own
[55:01] understanding will give us the reasoning
[55:04] oh I don't believe that I think this is
[55:07] a mistake because our mind is our
[55:10] absolute yet the Bible tells us lean not
[55:13] to your own
[55:16] understanding and as long as we have our
[55:18] own understanding and we are unable to
[55:21] be such as babes that we learn and SE at
[55:25] his feet is pretty much much impossible
[55:27] for us to see the kingdom of God that's
[55:30] why he said that ye must be born
[55:33] again and the birth into the kingdom of
[55:37] God as Elijah was lifted up into the
[55:40] Heavenly it said like you know who is me
[55:42] I don't deserve this where should I be
[55:45] in this life Journey who am I they said
[55:48] like you know but then the angel
[55:51] came because you cannot start your
[55:54] ministry without having
[55:56] Angelic visitation amen Leia cannot get
[56:00] out of Darkness without Angelic
[56:04] visitation when William bham came to us
[56:06] is the Angel of the age amen and when
[56:10] William bam came to us he came with six
[56:12] wings with humility hiding his
[56:16] face hiding his feet and with wings it
[56:20] he did fly and by him flying among us we
[56:24] saw him from 47 to 65
[56:27] we saw all the moves of his ministry
[56:30] then when we sit under that Ministry we
[56:33] know that if we keep our eyes on him
[56:36] we're going to receive the same
[56:37] blessings as he
[56:41] did and Elisha who was also called said
[56:46] that this is the only way for us to
[56:48] receive the blessing is to see him to
[56:51] watch him glory be to God that we have
[56:55] these tapes of available to us for us to
[56:58] know what is the
[57:00] absolute and if the prophet is not the
[57:03] absolute if the word is not the absolute
[57:06] then what is the
[57:09] absolute because the Democrats are
[57:11] bringing an agenda the the Republicans
[57:13] are bringing an agenda the Communists
[57:15] are bringing an agenda we've we've seen
[57:17] all these things on the past few
[57:19] services and as they are coming and what
[57:23] is the end of our what is our faith
[57:26] because they're not fighting those
[57:27] people out there because they already
[57:30] won them but they say we're coming after
[57:33] your
[57:34] children and if they're coming after our
[57:36] children then us the children then we
[57:38] must have a safety we must have a place
[57:42] that we can come and hide ourself under
[57:46] we must be able to identify the place
[57:49] where he said like you know come he's
[57:52] The
[57:53] Refuge we must find The Rock
[57:56] we must find a place where that still
[57:58] small voice is still speaking
[58:00] through but then we can find that that's
[58:03] still Small Voice in dispute and debates
[58:06] and movies and and all kind of filthy
[58:09] lives and
[58:10] things but then he provided a place he
[58:13] said that you know uh in the leian
[58:17] church age he
[58:19] [Music]
[58:20] said a momentary consideration of the of
[58:23] church history would prove how accurate
[58:25] this thought is in the Dark Ages the
[58:29] word was almost entirely lost to the
[58:32] people but God sent Luther with the word
[58:36] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[58:39] but they organized and again the pure
[58:42] word was lost for organization tends
[58:44] toward dogma and Creeds and and not
[58:47] simple word it's exactly what is
[58:49] happening today no we can't take this
[58:52] butam is wrong on this or we can't take
[58:55] this butam did mistake here butam did a
[58:58] mistake
[58:59] here why because that's the spirit of
[59:04] organization we take what pleases us
[59:06] what fits us especially with our
[59:08] cultures oh you know with our cultures
[59:10] you know we we think that we have the
[59:13] right kind of music and kind of
[59:16] atmosphere the way to conduct the
[59:18] service it's exactly that same Spirit it
[59:21] begins in a very humble subtle way
[59:25] before you know it it's like you know we
[59:27] don't really want to listen to
[59:30] that we don't really want to take that
[59:32] into consideration because the prophet
[59:34] really didn't really mean
[59:38] that why it is that same Spirit then God
[59:42] send s sent Wesley and he was the voice
[59:46] with the word in his day the people who
[59:49] took his Revelation from the from God
[59:52] became the living EP pistol read and
[59:55] known of all men for of all men for
[59:58] their
[59:59] generation
[1:00:01] elishah was to sit under this man
[1:00:04] Ministry for him to become the word made
[1:00:09] manifest in his
[1:00:11] day and the word in this hour tonight is
[1:00:14] still the same and he has sent us
[1:00:17] William brunham so that we can become
[1:00:20] the
[1:00:21] word because Elisha was sitting under
[1:00:23] Elijah's Ministry
[1:00:26] showing us his life story showing how
[1:00:30] the woman understood that Elisha was
[1:00:33] under elijia Ministry for her to become
[1:00:36] for him to become her
[1:00:39] absolute because the word didn't come
[1:00:42] from uh start from with uh with
[1:00:44] elishah but Elijah came to restore the
[1:00:48] altar amen Elijah came to destroy all
[1:00:52] the false prophets and when he did that
[1:00:56] was to reestablish the word amen come
[1:00:59] from wherever background that you came
[1:01:01] from all of us we have to leave all our
[1:01:05] cultures our mind our ideas our self
[1:01:11] centeredness all those things we have to
[1:01:14] put it on the side and take everything
[1:01:16] that Elijah is saying and whatever
[1:01:19] Elijah says amen
[1:01:22] amen if youah say that your sisters I
[1:01:25] want you your place to be here
[1:01:27] amen it might not make sense as yet it
[1:01:31] might not even be clear but glory be to
[1:01:34] God that when we saw the communism that
[1:01:37] the way if it came into the people
[1:01:40] people could we couldn't even realize it
[1:01:43] that's right we said y we we don't have
[1:01:46] you know the jobs that don't pay enough
[1:01:48] anymore the way they used to pay now we
[1:01:52] have to have our women to also start
[1:01:55] working
[1:01:56] but then it comes to say that's
[1:02:00] communism we couldn't understand
[1:02:03] it but then when if we are Elijah today
[1:02:07] what do we say
[1:02:09] Amen Lord I don't know how you going to
[1:02:12] do it but I have to believe
[1:02:15] it I don't see how is it going to happen
[1:02:19] but I have to believe
[1:02:21] it because the woman when she took
[1:02:25] Elijah
[1:02:26] as her absolute right she didn't know if
[1:02:31] the baby was going to raise or not right
[1:02:34] because all the Medical Science and
[1:02:38] everybody all the smart people showed
[1:02:40] her all the evidence that the baby is
[1:02:46] dead all the economics of the World
[1:02:48] shows that if the two parents do not
[1:02:51] work they cannot pay all they cannot
[1:02:53] meet all the needs of the family my
[1:02:57] everything is showing there but Elijah
[1:02:59] said I want you first to be
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:03] healed I want your husband to be in your
[1:03:06] position it is hard for the woman to
[1:03:11] understand that that's what Elijah
[1:03:14] want but as long as we are under his
[1:03:18] ministry he said take the word your
[1:03:22] place is to take care of those
[1:03:24] babies you Minister your job is to sit
[1:03:28] down and study the word and pray over it
[1:03:31] you matters your your your time spend it
[1:03:34] in prayer for your CH your children
[1:03:38] am regardless how hard it is but the
[1:03:42] Bible the brother say we carry on the
[1:03:44] the people who took his Revelation from
[1:03:48] God it was not wly coming with his
[1:03:52] Revelation the fact that I'm taking the
[1:03:54] word my life journey I took the word he
[1:03:58] said like you know this is your
[1:04:00] life everything that I tried to do oh I
[1:04:03] want to go and become a nighty guy said
[1:04:05] like no that's not your
[1:04:09] job well I'll go and I'll start this
[1:04:11] business here I'll probably go leave it
[1:04:13] he say no I didn't tell you to go
[1:04:18] there he want he has a people in mind
[1:04:22] and we are that people am and we are the
[1:04:26] chosen one that he wants to fulfill that
[1:04:30] Revelation because by receiving that
[1:04:32] revelation we are becoming the living
[1:04:36] Epistles how you making it in this
[1:04:38] generation no girlfriends no boyfriend
[1:04:41] no this and all that because we took the
[1:04:44] words of
[1:04:46] Elijah and Elijah to us as he would go
[1:04:50] to God and say Lord you know one thing
[1:04:52] that in my life I never committed
[1:04:54] adultery he also want to have sons and
[1:04:57] daughters also in this last day you grew
[1:05:01] up in the message you are born or with
[1:05:03] all your virtues until you get into the
[1:05:06] marriage like that God wants that to
[1:05:09] happen and he has people in mind and
[1:05:12] that people is us and that people we are
[1:05:15] the ones that are called to that that
[1:05:17] great vision the people who took his
[1:05:20] Revelation from God became the living a
[1:05:22] pistol read of and known of all men for
[1:05:25] dead generation ation when the Methodist
[1:05:27] failed God raised up others and so it
[1:05:30] has gone he has gone on through the
[1:05:34] years until until this last day there is
[1:05:37] again another people in the
[1:05:42] Land There is a people again in the land
[1:05:47] it's not the
[1:05:48] future now
[1:05:52] tonight and he says who under their
[1:05:57] Messenger right people who will sit
[1:06:00] under the
[1:06:02] messenger not people say oh no I I know
[1:06:06] also I can also preach the Bible no you
[1:06:08] cannot preach the Bible yes amen you
[1:06:12] take what Elijah told you bring it in
[1:06:16] the Bible then you'll be able to preach
[1:06:18] the
[1:06:19] Bible you didn't know what the D of
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ was until Elijah came forth
[1:06:25] yes because that's the greatest
[1:06:27] revelation of all time because if you
[1:06:30] don't have the revelation of Jesus
[1:06:32] Christ the rest of the Bible is blacked
[1:06:34] out to
[1:06:36] you and yet we have people who say know
[1:06:40] I can also preach from you know from on
[1:06:42] my research and development and you know
[1:06:45] I've studied
[1:06:46] and but God didn't send
[1:06:50] you God didn't send you regardless of
[1:06:52] the research that you've done God didn't
[1:06:54] send you
[1:06:56] yes Wesley and and all of them they
[1:06:59] didn't send
[1:07:01] themselves because many times that the
[1:07:04] people God sent they don't also don't
[1:07:06] always like to
[1:07:09] go and when you come to us like you know
[1:07:12] I know I know I know we can clearly see
[1:07:15] like n that's not kind Godlike we know
[1:07:19] people that God s they know they
[1:07:21] understand that the work is to too
[1:07:23] great Moses god I can go you see me I
[1:07:27] can talk
[1:07:29] you Ela go I don't know why me
[1:07:35] I'm je go I have excuses me Gideon go I
[1:07:41] am the least Joshua go I no all of
[1:07:45] them have always had
[1:07:49] excuses because they know the warfront
[1:07:52] is not a joke
[1:07:55] because standing on the pulpit is not
[1:07:57] just coming and one quotation two
[1:08:00] quotations and you go no after this I
[1:08:02] have to deal with Spirits after the
[1:08:05] word so therefore we have first to sit
[1:08:10] under Elijah because Elijah will tell us
[1:08:14] demonology how to work with them and if
[1:08:18] we do not sit under his ministry then we
[1:08:21] are just exposed to all kind of
[1:08:23] things no wonder we see today people
[1:08:26] just you know gets the church make a lot
[1:08:28] of money gets him under organization
[1:08:30] he's dead and
[1:08:32] forever but if we have to be that people
[1:08:35] in the land
[1:08:37] today brother says who under the
[1:08:40] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:08:43] final
[1:08:44] age for you to be the last voice I am
[1:08:47] the bride I am the bride stay under the
[1:08:52] messenger stay under the messenger
[1:08:56] what the prophet says that's what I
[1:08:59] believe for my family for my household
[1:09:03] and for everybody else
[1:09:05] amen yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:09:08] mouthpiece of God it it it is its own
[1:09:12] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[1:09:15] will confound her through the prophet
[1:09:18] and the bride amen here goes not the
[1:09:22] greatest challenge
[1:09:24] ahead we sit under the messenger after
[1:09:27] the that's why as I laid out my a little
[1:09:30] bit of my life there you putting all
[1:09:33] this you know natural hair and long
[1:09:35] skirt and all this you don't do this you
[1:09:37] don't paint your nails and all this you
[1:09:40] don't stay under that that level because
[1:09:44] he says that you know God will confound
[1:09:47] the church there are people in other
[1:09:49] words there are people who are going to
[1:09:51] challenge your
[1:09:53] faith why why why why
[1:09:56] why it's it's just a pent it's it's just
[1:10:00] there are pens for women there are pens
[1:10:02] for
[1:10:03] men but all you know is just pens it's
[1:10:07] just I have to wear skirt now you are
[1:10:09] faced with a challenge then you have to
[1:10:11] challenge
[1:10:12] yourself you have to know where you
[1:10:15] standing you are a housewife a a young
[1:10:18] boy walking around he's handsome look at
[1:10:21] him he doesn't work out but look at him
[1:10:23] here oh my God it it is the
[1:10:27] challenge you are a man now like you
[1:10:30] know God has blessed you now you have
[1:10:32] all the money and now here comes the
[1:10:35] challenge now you you as uh the brother
[1:10:38] was telling me uh in um in Mexico in
[1:10:42] Mexico they said oh he's single again
[1:10:44] when a a a married man goes out they say
[1:10:46] like no he's single
[1:10:51] again that's the challenge I Hadad it
[1:10:54] says he will confound her through the
[1:10:56] prophet and the
[1:10:58] bride for the voice of God will be in
[1:11:01] her yes it is for it says that in the
[1:11:04] last chapter of Revelation the spirit
[1:11:05] and the bride say come once more the
[1:11:08] world will hear direct direct from God
[1:11:11] as at Pentecost but of course that word
[1:11:14] bride will be rep repudiated in as in
[1:11:19] the first age Amen to sit under Elisha's
[1:11:23] Ministry is not an easy ask that's right
[1:11:27] brother I went to South
[1:11:30] Africa first time ever in my
[1:11:33] life I face this challenge in the house
[1:11:37] I see a young man and a young girl
[1:11:38] coming out of the room my first reaction
[1:11:41] said where are the
[1:11:44] parents I said this is shouldn't this
[1:11:46] shouldn't be
[1:11:48] possible they shouldn't
[1:11:50] be then I start realizing oh who am I
[1:11:56] who am
[1:11:57] I what am I
[1:11:59] doing I've had all these
[1:12:01] experiences what am I doing how am I
[1:12:05] going to deal with this oh daddy's not
[1:12:08] here oh mommy's not here nobody to look
[1:12:12] after me nobody to tell me one two
[1:12:15] three oh I can go out whenever I
[1:12:18] can oh I can do when whatever I want
[1:12:22] nobody's looking after me
[1:12:26] there Comes The
[1:12:28] Challenge it's either I had a proper
[1:12:31] conversion or I
[1:12:33] didn't because at that
[1:12:35] time the only person that I couldn't
[1:12:38] fool was
[1:12:40] myself because going to church I will
[1:12:43] show up like any other brother right I
[1:12:46] will shake hands God bless you we know
[1:12:48] the the the the greeting God bless you
[1:12:51] brother God bless you how are you oh
[1:12:52] Shalom my brother shalom
[1:12:55] but here now on the street nobody was
[1:12:57] there with
[1:12:58] me if I had not said truly under
[1:13:02] Elijah's
[1:13:04] Ministry then I wouldn't have known what
[1:13:07] way to to take then came the challenge
[1:13:10] along you don't drink really even a
[1:13:13] little bit H you know this one here it's
[1:13:16] not uh I believe uh you from South
[1:13:19] Africa you know Savannah you can have
[1:13:22] some
[1:13:23] Savannah you know it's says it's just
[1:13:25] probably uh uh 5% or less than 5% of
[1:13:32] alcohol maybe I
[1:13:34] should it is a
[1:13:37] challenge it's not a joke of
[1:13:41] uh I think that you know I'm in the
[1:13:43] message to have uh to have the title of
[1:13:46] the
[1:13:48] message but it's at that time that the
[1:13:52] time that you spent you invested in your
[1:13:54] younger age
[1:13:56] you'll see that that now come to
[1:13:59] pass take the time now that you are
[1:14:01] young yes take time to invest in Reading
[1:14:06] yes sir brother you may not see it the
[1:14:09] reason why you're doing now but that
[1:14:12] investment will bring forth dividends in
[1:14:15] the appointed time that you will expect
[1:14:17] the
[1:14:18] least invest that time now yes sir the
[1:14:22] same way that Daniel 14 years old went
[1:14:25] into
[1:14:26] Babylon for him to be able to stand
[1:14:28] there and say like you know I'll defile
[1:14:31] myself not against with the meat of the
[1:14:33] king it was the investment of all these
[1:14:35] 14
[1:14:38] years prise God many times we think that
[1:14:40] you know oh I'll just go to church I'll
[1:14:42] just say no come to church bring your
[1:14:44] pen write it down go back review it it
[1:14:48] might not make sense today brother say I
[1:14:51] spent two years studying the Book of
[1:14:53] Genesis it didn't make sense to him
[1:14:55] you're not alone under this
[1:14:57] journey it's not an overnight
[1:15:01] success he wants you to invest more in
[1:15:04] those
[1:15:05] years so that in the appointed time then
[1:15:09] now you're going to see the men of Faith
[1:15:11] rise then you'll be surprised is this
[1:15:13] still me how was I able to overcome that
[1:15:17] how did it even come to
[1:15:19] pass who am
[1:15:21] I that is our life Journey amen
[1:15:25] that is the mystery of elishah under
[1:15:28] Elijah's
[1:15:29] Ministry it was not just like you know
[1:15:32] going to church coming back home and
[1:15:34] stuff and praying with the parents and
[1:15:36] things
[1:15:38] right he
[1:15:40] said in
[1:15:42] Joshua Joshua chapter 1 uh um verse
[1:15:49] one now after the death of Moses El
[1:15:53] leta's departure
[1:15:55] the the servant of the Lord it came to
[1:15:59] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[1:16:01] son of Nan Moses Minister MOS Moses
[1:16:06] Moses Minister saying my servant is dead
[1:16:10] 1965 now therefore arise go over this
[1:16:13] Jordan thou and all these people and
[1:16:17] unto the land which are give to them
[1:16:20] even to the children of
[1:16:22] Israel he's not commissioning Joshua
[1:16:26] yeah this is
[1:16:29] 1965 the man is laying there in the
[1:16:32] casket some of them are still wondering
[1:16:34] is it going to raise do you think you
[1:16:36] know maybe we should wait maybe have a
[1:16:39] plane somewhere you know waiting for him
[1:16:40] to come
[1:16:42] back but God's program was
[1:16:46] unfolding because if they had set under
[1:16:49] his ministry listening to what he was
[1:16:51] telling them showing them God's program
[1:16:54] they wouldn't be the waiting for
[1:16:58] him because they were under the
[1:17:02] ministry but they couldn't understand
[1:17:04] the move of the ministry from one member
[1:17:07] to another
[1:17:11] member she is not she she's still
[1:17:15] thinking that she's still a little
[1:17:17] girl she wants to wear high heels and
[1:17:20] all these skirts and all these stuff she
[1:17:24] doesn't know her body has already
[1:17:27] changed that now she has come to
[1:17:30] maturity that when she's walking around
[1:17:33] in the street people are noticing
[1:17:36] her
[1:17:39] right she wants to to dress like the
[1:17:42] rest of the girls like
[1:17:45] no Elijah told you go up go here sit
[1:17:51] under my Ministry if you want the
[1:17:53] blessing this this is how you need to
[1:17:56] dress God willing will'll get into that
[1:17:58] in the uh in the next series God
[1:18:02] willing the outer coat the the the holy
[1:18:05] place and the holy of holies and at
[1:18:07] times we get influenced by all kind of
[1:18:10] Ministries keeping us bound but we need
[1:18:13] to be aware to sit under Elijah's
[1:18:16] Ministry we get to that by God's grace
[1:18:18] but he say you know stand up go take now
[1:18:22] the work to get going he say every place
[1:18:24] that the soul of your food shall tread
[1:18:26] upon that I have I given unto you as I
[1:18:30] said unto Moses from the Wilderness of
[1:18:32] verse um verse 6 to to save some time it
[1:18:35] said be
[1:18:37] strong and of a good
[1:18:42] courage verse seven only be thou very be
[1:18:46] thou strong and very
[1:18:49] courageous they
[1:18:51] say this is your ministry now this is
[1:18:54] your time for you to
[1:18:56] work I'll Lead You In all these steps
[1:18:59] here they said but be thou strong and
[1:19:03] courageous I said when he gave me the
[1:19:06] scripture when I was probably 16 I say
[1:19:09] why is he saying about like you know
[1:19:10] being s courage and stuff I think it's
[1:19:12] just another reading of the Bible you
[1:19:14] know maybe I don't really but I didn't
[1:19:17] know whatever you saying you need to
[1:19:21] take into consideration
[1:19:24] he will tell you something but you're
[1:19:27] going to face the challenge five six
[1:19:29] seven years
[1:19:32] later it's not because like you know
[1:19:34] it's a
[1:19:35] sermon mixed up with somebody life story
[1:19:38] that it's just maybe it's just another
[1:19:40] sermon no he's preparing us for the
[1:19:44] journey
[1:19:45] ahead he said be thou strong I read it I
[1:19:48] said well maybe it's like but this was
[1:19:52] supposed to be brother Bram right he's
[1:19:54] the one who take us out of Egypt and
[1:19:56] bring us into our promised land now I'm
[1:19:59] having confus mind battles now how do I
[1:20:03] reconcile what brother Brenham place is
[1:20:06] and me receiving this scripture about
[1:20:10] Joshua who am I going to bring into the
[1:20:12] land I'm I'm not I'm not a minister I'm
[1:20:15] I'm just here you know helping cleaning
[1:20:18] the church and maybe a little bit of
[1:20:20] Sunday school here and there you know
[1:20:22] I'm around all these elders but God's
[1:20:25] grace God has given me that that Grace
[1:20:27] to always be around these men these men
[1:20:29] of God but he was preparing
[1:20:32] me he's preparing each one of us he said
[1:20:36] like be thou
[1:20:38] courageous when you go out there be
[1:20:42] strong verse seven and then it goes
[1:20:45] again verse 9 he say have I not
[1:20:48] commanded thee be strong and of a good
[1:20:52] courage three times
[1:20:55] and when God is repeating the same thing
[1:20:57] over and over and over you better pay
[1:21:01] attention to it because he knows the
[1:21:04] challenge
[1:21:05] ahead because he knows that it's not a
[1:21:08] picnic that you're going to I'm going
[1:21:10] into Canan land oh we going into
[1:21:13] Jerusalem
[1:21:15] no you have to go up right amen you have
[1:21:20] to have the
[1:21:22] breastplate you need to have the soul
[1:21:26] you need to have the helmet you need to
[1:21:28] have the
[1:21:30] sandals you need to be wired up but I'm
[1:21:35] saying you need to be prayed
[1:21:38] up because the challenge is
[1:21:41] real as the brother likes to say the
[1:21:43] struggle is
[1:21:46] real because you're not going to when
[1:21:49] that boy the fantasy that you like to
[1:21:52] have about girls or boys
[1:21:55] and you see it's that very girl walking
[1:21:57] up to you it's that very boy walking up
[1:21:59] to
[1:22:01] you now you you having all these mind
[1:22:03] bottles what am I going to do oh my God
[1:22:05] how is it going to happen now I don't
[1:22:07] know what to do and all these things
[1:22:10] here that's where the investment that
[1:22:13] you made right amen learning how to sit
[1:22:16] under his
[1:22:17] ministry because everything that Elijah
[1:22:20] is telling us say like you know hey you
[1:22:23] the H the head of of the household look
[1:22:25] at your position you need to L them in
[1:22:28] prayer you you don't need you need to
[1:22:31] apply the
[1:22:33] blood you you just think why should we
[1:22:36] pray every morning and every
[1:22:39] night why should do you can you guys can
[1:22:42] read your Bibles right you read we'll
[1:22:44] have our night devotion at night you
[1:22:47] come back how I'm very tired don't you
[1:22:50] have homeworks to do go finish up with
[1:22:51] your homework then we'll get to that
[1:22:53] then before you know it you
[1:22:55] asleep and you
[1:22:57] think that you are being
[1:23:00] courageous and you are just pleased that
[1:23:02] your children your family is getting
[1:23:05] degrees and having making all this money
[1:23:08] but you don't see the
[1:23:10] distraction but you don't see communism
[1:23:13] coming into play right by the time that
[1:23:17] those children turn that family turn
[1:23:20] against you then you sit you say how did
[1:23:23] this happen to me but you were not aware
[1:23:27] you were not awakened you didn't pay
[1:23:29] attention to Elijah's
[1:23:38] voice I thought I would read the
[1:23:40] scripture that would uh that you would
[1:23:43] understand that the holy spirit that was
[1:23:45] Upon Jesus on this on the on this church
[1:23:48] today a moving is the same
[1:23:51] manner as the robe of Elijah fell down
[1:23:55] so the uh so these things that I do
[1:23:58] greater shall you do if I go unto my
[1:24:00] father and the Rob fell upon fell on the
[1:24:03] day of Pentecost that brought the glory
[1:24:05] back to his people but God but God lives
[1:24:09] in his church and he says and his spirit
[1:24:12] moves upon his people we must first
[1:24:16] realize that we living in a day of
[1:24:20] skeptic generation of people will not
[1:24:23] believe Jesus said though though the
[1:24:27] dead be raised they wouldn't believe
[1:24:30] them word has to be
[1:24:33] fulfilled this is the hour in which we
[1:24:35] living
[1:24:38] in after you we sit under Elijah's
[1:24:42] ministry under we face all this
[1:24:44] challenge for some of us at this stage
[1:24:47] but God's grace God
[1:24:49] willing in few weeks uh uh speaking
[1:24:53] about uh my life
[1:24:55] Journey that it
[1:24:58] has the desire to be
[1:25:01] married and this is one of the greatest
[1:25:04] challenge in our day
[1:25:07] right we walk in the churches we
[1:25:11] see even in brother brenham's time
[1:25:15] marriage a big
[1:25:18] challenge a very big
[1:25:21] challenge all these Investments people
[1:25:23] make
[1:25:25] they get into marriage it all breaks
[1:25:29] down then you
[1:25:31] wonder did they not
[1:25:34] invest did they not
[1:25:36] believe did they not sit under Elijah's
[1:25:41] Ministry here's the prophet says we must
[1:25:44] realize we're living in a day of
[1:25:49] skeptic many things will happen I am
[1:25:53] really
[1:25:54] asking for your
[1:25:56] prayers because I've been in this
[1:25:59] uh uh
[1:26:01] relationship
[1:26:03] for about since
[1:26:07] 2021 uh she is in the
[1:26:10] Congo God willing in uh few weeks she'll
[1:26:14] be among
[1:26:16] us I haven't uh set the date uh to to be
[1:26:20] married
[1:26:21] yet but once she's around I spoke with
[1:26:25] brother R and uh I'll be also reaching
[1:26:30] out to some people that he told me to
[1:26:32] talk to to help me with the
[1:26:35] wedding to prepare the wedding but it
[1:26:39] shouldn't just look it as like you know
[1:26:41] a joyful thing I know it's a joyful
[1:26:47] thing but the challenge that we seeing
[1:26:51] today we're dealing with in the in the
[1:26:53] message
[1:26:55] particularly people will get
[1:26:59] married and they can't make it through a
[1:27:02] year or
[1:27:03] two the wife is on the left husband is
[1:27:06] on the
[1:27:08] right if uh you have time in your daily
[1:27:12] prayers when you don't have enough time
[1:27:15] to do anything or you tired of praying
[1:27:19] remember
[1:27:22] me I'm really
[1:27:24] begging you or beseeching you remember
[1:27:26] me in your
[1:27:28] prayers because I've seen as I said my
[1:27:31] life I've shown you a little bit of my
[1:27:33] life story here that I think he has
[1:27:37] called me to do this work
[1:27:39] here everywhere that he has sent me
[1:27:42] there's no better success that I've seen
[1:27:45] in my life it's when I'm serving
[1:27:49] him and you know brother Bram says that
[1:27:53] if my wife divorces
[1:27:55] me I'm kicked out of the
[1:27:59] pulpit remember did devil will do
[1:28:03] anything in his
[1:28:05] power will try in any shape or
[1:28:08] form to try to take me down already just
[1:28:14] being alone all these years that I've
[1:28:16] been preaching we've been dealing with
[1:28:20] it yeah when you pray when I go I was
[1:28:24] was uh in Mexico here in Mexicali the
[1:28:27] pastor's daughter for six years never
[1:28:30] had a
[1:28:31] child then they came to me I say you
[1:28:34] know who am I I said well we'll just do
[1:28:37] what the prophet says set up the
[1:28:39] atmosphere start talking to the sisters
[1:28:41] talking to the brother and I prayed for
[1:28:44] him and I passed and I
[1:28:46] forget and before you know it you can
[1:28:49] verify this with brother Jose those who
[1:28:51] know him he is usually my interpreter
[1:28:54] down there is actually the one who told
[1:28:55] me he say hey do you know that uh the
[1:28:59] sister
[1:29:00] conceived I said oh okay good to know
[1:29:04] passed and then the K like hey the child
[1:29:07] is
[1:29:08] here then you understand another sister
[1:29:12] in the El see you say brother my uncle
[1:29:14] is
[1:29:15] dying you come you pray the Lord opens
[1:29:18] up the way amen and many other things a
[1:29:21] sister was a emic and uh in Colorado I
[1:29:25] just knew it when I went back there said
[1:29:28] do you you know when you prayed for her
[1:29:31] she had a blood issue but from the Time
[1:29:33] You Prayed he was gone amen but then at
[1:29:37] the same
[1:29:39] time some of these
[1:29:41] events always stay in our
[1:29:46] minds then you start going back and say
[1:29:49] oh now I
[1:29:51] understand after this I was going
[1:29:53] through such such a trouble such this
[1:29:56] such a
[1:29:57] this why because those Spirits they
[1:30:01] know you the channel through which yeah
[1:30:04] very good we were kicked out now we're
[1:30:08] dealing with
[1:30:10] you the reason I'm saying this now there
[1:30:13] will be another
[1:30:15] person who will be headed next to me who
[1:30:19] will also be the target of those Spirits
[1:30:22] right though said we know that marriage
[1:30:25] is something to be joyful about right
[1:30:28] but he said be thou courageous I'll be
[1:30:31] courageous but nevertheless but what I'm
[1:30:34] say the success of my Ministry is I have
[1:30:37] people 6:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. 12 300 p.m.
[1:30:40] 6:00 p.m. 900 p.m. and on and on praying
[1:30:43] for
[1:30:45] me and we are called to work like he
[1:30:49] did and I'm coming and I'm asking prayer
[1:30:52] in front of the church
[1:30:55] because you'll be helping me naturally
[1:30:57] setting up the wedding and all these
[1:30:59] things but also remember the most
[1:31:02] powerful weapon that the Lord has given
[1:31:04] us is
[1:31:07] prayer because it is our
[1:31:10] ministry you might not be on the pulpit
[1:31:13] but if you are the prayer Warrior
[1:31:15] remember me remember our pastor remember
[1:31:18] our young people remember our sisters
[1:31:22] remember the church
[1:31:24] yes so that the work can
[1:31:27] unfold amen because after
[1:31:31] this we
[1:31:33] see that the challenge come and we're
[1:31:36] going to close here
[1:31:38] quickly and when Elijah came into his
[1:31:42] ministry after Elijah's Elijah Elijah's
[1:31:46] departure and when the sons of the
[1:31:48] Prophet uh 2 King verse1 15 and when the
[1:31:51] sons of the Prophet which were to view
[1:31:54] Jericho saw him they said the spirit of
[1:31:56] Elijah do right upon on Elijah on
[1:31:59] Elisha and they came to him and and
[1:32:02] bowed themselves to the ground before
[1:32:06] him right after they saw the Spirit upon
[1:32:08] the sky the worship started you are
[1:32:13] greatest Pastor great ministers great
[1:32:15] song leader they start bowing before
[1:32:18] him and here's the challenge he said
[1:32:21] like you know the challenge is going to
[1:32:22] come but he didn't know how soon this is
[1:32:25] going to
[1:32:26] happen those who were married before us
[1:32:29] they didn't know how soon the challenge
[1:32:30] is going to kick
[1:32:32] in those who have been preaching they
[1:32:34] didn't know how quickly they're going to
[1:32:36] get into
[1:32:38] trouble and they bowed before him and
[1:32:41] they said unto him behold now there be
[1:32:44] with thy servant 50 strong men remember
[1:32:47] this 50 strong strong men under Elisha's
[1:32:49] Ministry three times the king had sent
[1:32:52] 50 men to come after
[1:32:55] elishah the Same Spirit also coming
[1:32:57] after
[1:32:59] Elisha he say like you know you know
[1:33:02] they they're trying out like you know to
[1:33:04] get him into a certain form of
[1:33:07] security and said they said unto him
[1:33:09] behold there be with thy servant 50
[1:33:12] strong men let them go we pray thee and
[1:33:16] seek and seek thy Master Les per
[1:33:18] Adventure the spirit of the Lord have
[1:33:20] taken him up and cast him upon some
[1:33:23] Mountain or into some Valley and and he
[1:33:26] said ye shall not
[1:33:28] s if this not returning
[1:33:32] Ministry let's go look for him let's
[1:33:34] have a plan let's have some some ideas
[1:33:37] of our own our security of our
[1:33:41] own you know when you get into America
[1:33:43] there'll be this challenge here and this
[1:33:46] this here it's like
[1:33:48] no Elijah didn't teach us
[1:33:51] that Elijah told us that we have to be
[1:33:54] young people holding the flame of the of
[1:33:56] the
[1:33:58] ministry we have to be this a pistol red
[1:34:01] of all men in our marriages in our
[1:34:03] families in everything that goes with
[1:34:09] it he told them no don't
[1:34:12] go but the Bible says and when they urg
[1:34:16] him till he was
[1:34:21] ashamed brother you have to do it
[1:34:23] brother you have to do it brother sister
[1:34:25] you have to work in Sister you have to
[1:34:27] work sister you have to work sister you
[1:34:31] have to work okay maybe I should just
[1:34:36] work you can wear pants you know it's
[1:34:38] just a pant you know it's just a pent
[1:34:40] you'll be beautiful you know just cut a
[1:34:42] little bit of your hair just a little
[1:34:44] bit of your hair just a just a clear
[1:34:46] base on your on your nails you know just
[1:34:48] a little clear base just a okay just a
[1:34:52] little bit of foundation you know just a
[1:34:53] little bit of
[1:34:56] foundation just straighten it up a
[1:34:58] little bit just straighten it up a
[1:35:00] little bit just a little bit you know
[1:35:01] just a little bit you
[1:35:05] know then he
[1:35:07] said maybe I maybe I just I'm just a
[1:35:10] girl like the everybody of the rest of
[1:35:11] the
[1:35:12] girls maybe I'm just a boy like the rest
[1:35:15] of
[1:35:16] them maybe I can just have a girlfriend
[1:35:18] like the rest of
[1:35:19] them maybe I can just have a girlfriend
[1:35:22] though I am married nevertheless
[1:35:24] maybe I could just you know be running
[1:35:26] around without anybody
[1:35:27] knowing maybe I could just watch a movie
[1:35:30] there and nobody
[1:35:32] knowing why the pressure was upon him
[1:35:35] because he told him he said be the
[1:35:38] courageous three
[1:35:40] times and then before he knows after the
[1:35:43] Moses Elijah's departure here comes the
[1:35:46] pressure 50 of
[1:35:48] them try to convince 50 people of your
[1:35:52] of of your holy ghost of your faith at
[1:35:56] school at
[1:35:58] work try to convince 50 girls walking up
[1:36:01] naked before you not saying a
[1:36:06] word it
[1:36:08] requires really a lot of
[1:36:13] strength some of us said well I'll just
[1:36:16] probably you know start my own company
[1:36:18] so I can control everything then the law
[1:36:20] said like you know you cannot
[1:36:21] discriminate when you're hiring
[1:36:26] and the most qualifying person look at
[1:36:28] the way she's
[1:36:30] dressing and when she comes to
[1:36:34] work there Comes The Challenge you try
[1:36:37] to hide under the
[1:36:39] work but what couldn't hide
[1:36:43] you you try to have a
[1:36:47] professional as much as you
[1:36:50] can but then she can make up a story
[1:36:54] and she'll be
[1:36:58] believed and where is our
[1:37:03] refuge but he said I need you to stay
[1:37:06] with everything Moses my servant told
[1:37:10] you I want you to create the
[1:37:14] atmosphere that's where the greatest
[1:37:16] battle ever fought comes into
[1:37:19] play she comes in with all her attire
[1:37:23] but then when the angel of the Lord
[1:37:25] stands around as the prophet says you
[1:37:28] know she came in and say sister God
[1:37:31] bless you you know he liked the way he
[1:37:35] dressed the girl went was at school
[1:37:38] alone nobody with
[1:37:40] her say oh you know for you to play with
[1:37:44] uh everybody in the gymnastic you need
[1:37:45] to put like no I'll stand with the
[1:37:48] word nobody was with her but the angel
[1:37:51] of the Lord the the Lord went to give
[1:37:54] report I say sister when you took that
[1:37:57] position the angel of H was very
[1:38:01] happy at times we think that we alone at
[1:38:03] school you know nobody's looking
[1:38:06] nobody's uh nobody knows me around here
[1:38:08] no the angel of the Lord wants to see
[1:38:11] that because every time you come to
[1:38:13] church the word is taking
[1:38:16] place be
[1:38:18] natural keep your
