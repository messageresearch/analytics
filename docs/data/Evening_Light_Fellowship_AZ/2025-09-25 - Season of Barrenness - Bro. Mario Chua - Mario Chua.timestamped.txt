[19:01] [Music]
[19:02] God is so good if you would just make
[19:05] announcement for us
[19:09] &gt;&gt; God.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I
[19:12] greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[19:14] Christ. I don't know if uh you all are
[19:18] aware but Rashashana has started uh in
[19:21] Israel. It's a feast time. It's one of
[19:23] their biggest feasts of the year. And
[19:26] the largest gathering of Jews in
[19:28] Jerusalem is happening right now.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and they're under such
[19:33] an expectation. It is a time of of a new
[19:36] year of repentance and it's also they
[19:38] say a time of judgment.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; But remember, judgment begins at the
[19:42] house of God. So, they're kind of
[19:44] purging themselves and then saying, "Oh,
[19:46] God." And many prophecies, they're
[19:50] they're all pointing to Old Testament uh
[19:53] scriptures and they're saying, "Hey, do
[19:55] you realize this anti-semitism and all
[19:59] of the countries that surround Israel is
[20:02] completely surrounded by the countries
[20:05] that are their enemies that want to
[20:08] absolutely eradicate all of the Jews,
[20:11] not to just give them a place. They do.
[20:13] They want to get rid of them.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; And so anyway, uh they're saying, "Hey,
[20:17] do you realize these countries are the
[20:20] countries of Gog and Mog,
[20:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[20:23] &gt;&gt; According to Ezekiel's prophecy, how
[20:26] close are we?" Well, now we know that
[20:28] Armageddon comes before Gog and Magog.
[20:31] But I'll tell you what, saints of God,
[20:33] all of the pieces prophetically,
[20:36] &gt;&gt; okay, are coming together,
[20:40] excuse me, right now. And brother
[20:42] Brennham said, "Watch Israel." That's
[20:45] God's time piece.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to be aware of these
[20:49] things. I'm I'm excited. I think this is
[20:52] an exciting time to to be alive and let
[20:55] our light shine and let us stand up.
[20:58] We're in the midst of a woke generation.
[21:01] Amen. I got woke up. Amen. By a midnight
[21:05] cry, hallelujah. A message of this hour.
[21:08] I thank God for that. Others are getting
[21:11] woke in a different direction,
[21:13] &gt;&gt; but we thank God that we've heard the
[21:15] voice in this end time that's to uh tell
[21:19] us to get ready because he's coming.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I just uh I wanted to say that
[21:24] just so that all of you would be aware
[21:27] uh of what's happening. Pray for Israel.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he that blesses Israel
[21:34] will be blessed. Amen. God bless you.
[21:39] Amen. If we could sing that song, Heart
[21:41] of Worship.
[21:48] When the music fades
[21:51] and all is stripped away
[21:55] and I simply come.

[22:05] something. That's a word that'll bless
[22:09] your heart.
[22:14] I'll bring you more than a song.
[22:18] For a song in itself is not what you
[22:22] have required.

[22:34] looking into my heart.

[23:31] I have is your
[23:34] every single breath.
[23:39] Lord, I'll bring you more than a song.
[23:43] For a song in itself is not what you
[23:48] have required.
[23:51] Oh, you search much deeper within
[23:56] through the way things appear. For
[23:59] looking into my heart,
[24:05] I'm coming back to my heart.

[30:39] people Lord God.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Just want to thank that

[30:50] &gt;&gt; that you may have preeminence, Lord,

[30:58] &gt;&gt; So, I commit this service to you, Lord
[30:59] God, in Jesus Christ's name.

[31:04] &gt;&gt; So, to greet you all in the name of the
[31:06] Lord Jesus Christ. So, just uh pray for
[31:09] me because my tongue has a cold sore.
[31:12] So, it's really hard,
[31:14] &gt;&gt; but uh it pulls my lot tonight.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; I know God is always in complete
[31:20] control.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; And uh we're so glad to be in the house
[31:24] of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Because we have something to rejoice.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Not because we are so many, not because
[31:32] uh uh we are here, but uh we rejoice
[31:36] because we have the word in this last
[31:38] day.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Not just a partial word
[31:40] but the full word of God that's being
[31:42] revealed to us. Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; God show us
[31:47] uh before today and tomorrow.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; So we have a complete package.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; So we just need to depend upon the Lord
[31:55] tonight. Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; And uh even tonight I cannot just speak
[32:00] by my own self. I just need your help.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:04] As always says uh when you are in the
[32:07] pulpit it's always a two-way.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; It is not a showmanship because as a
[32:13] ministers we are just like waiters.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; We need we need uh we need to take your
[32:19] order in order for us to deliver.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; So
[32:26] just don't stare at me as if you you are
[32:30] blank.
[32:32] Amen. you just uh twinkle twinkle your
[32:35] eyes or smile so that I will know that
[32:38] you are responding to the word. Amen.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us not look at the person
[32:44] but let's look at the the the word of
[32:46] God tonight. Amen. And I believe we come
[32:48] here not to see a person but we come to
[32:51] manifest or to to enjoy the word of God
[32:54] tonight. Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Even though the minister sometimes is
[32:58] inadequate
[32:59] as for me in adequate to explain the
[33:02] word but as you pull it will be the word
[33:05] it will be God who will give you the
[33:07] right word
[33:09] &gt;&gt; for your needs. Amen.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; So I will not hold you too long tonight
[33:13] and we will go directly to the word of
[33:15] God.
[33:17] Just a simple thought that I'm trusting
[33:20] that it will lift up our faith and
[33:22] encourage
[33:24] uh knowing our day and our season and uh
[33:28] knowing the pattern of how God moved
[33:31] upon his people.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Genesis 11
[33:37] verse 29-30.
[33:42] So this is a three portion of scripture.
[33:45] Genesis 11 2930. Then Genesis chapter 25
[33:51] 2021.
[33:52] Then Genesis 29 verse 31.
[33:59] Chapter 11
[34:01] verse 29. And Abraham and Nahor took
[34:05] them wives. So Abraham and Na are
[34:08] siblings. And the name of Abraham's wife
[34:11] was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife.
[34:14] Mela, the daughter of Heron, the father
[34:17] of Mela, and the father of Isaac. But
[34:20] Sarah was barren and she had no
[34:23] children. So this is the first time that
[34:26] baroness is mentioned in the Bible. And
[34:30] so we know that there's always a hidden
[34:32] truth
[34:34] &gt;&gt; associated with things like this that
[34:36] God places in the stories in the lives
[34:39] of people
[34:41] recording the word.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:43] As the prophet said, every every period,
[34:47] every comma, every line, every verse,
[34:49] there is always Christ in it.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; So if we cannot see Christ in every
[34:54] verse, in every line and every chapter,
[34:56] then we need to look back
[34:58] &gt;&gt; the word to the word of God.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Genesis 25:20.
[35:05] And Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[35:08] Rebecca to wife, the daughter of
[35:11] Bitwell, the Syrians of Pandan
[35:15] Padan, the sister of Lean, the Syrian.
[35:19] And Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[35:21] wife because she was barren. So first
[35:24] Abraham wife was barren.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Then now is Isaac wife was barren.
[35:32] Genesis 29:31. And when the Lord saw
[35:35] that Leia was hated, he opened her womb,
[35:39] but Rachel was barren. So notice the
[35:42] three barren woman in a row, one after
[35:45] the other, the wives of Abraham, Isaac,
[35:48] and Jacob, old barren. And may the Lord
[35:51] add a blessing upon the reading of this
[35:53] word. You may now be seated.
[35:57] I still remember when brother Warren
[35:59] preached about this baroness way back in
[36:02] uh when we were in Maryland
[36:05] and that's the first time I heard him
[36:06] preach about the baroness but I believe
[36:09] this is important subject that we can we
[36:12] can relate amen
[36:14] &gt;&gt; because all these women in uh the old
[36:17] testament
[36:19] it's just reflection of our journey in
[36:23] life we can be identified in Sarah We
[36:26] can be identified in Rahab or we can be
[36:29] identified with Rachel
[36:31] &gt;&gt; because they are just a shadow
[36:35] of reality.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; We are not a shadow but we are the
[36:39] reality of the shadow. All the women in
[36:42] the Old Testament speaks about churches
[36:45] and they are reflections of what we are
[36:48] now uh being made manifest because we
[36:51] are the reality of the shadows. Amen. So
[36:55] before we go to our subject the season
[36:57] of baroness uh let us uh define the word
[37:02] baroness
[37:03] which typically refer to the state of
[37:06] being unproductive, empty
[37:09] or unable to produce life. So barrenness
[37:13] can have an incredibly
[37:16] profound negative emotional impact on
[37:19] women who discover herself to be barren.
[37:23] And there is also a great strain that is
[37:26] put in her relationship with her husband
[37:29] as well as family members and friends.
[37:31] So barness is su sometimes a bad word
[37:35] and sometimes is associated sometimes
[37:37] with a curse. They said it. But yet
[37:40] barrenness is a thing that is not
[37:42] restricted to a woman who cannot
[37:44] conceive and bear children. But it can
[37:47] also include many other things of life
[37:50] of different struggle that we go through
[37:53] as we go along the journey of our lives.
[37:56] For example, when a man loses his his
[37:59] job or his ability to provide for his
[38:02] family, then that is also a form of
[38:04] baroness for himself,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:07] because it can make him feel unfulfilled
[38:12] &gt;&gt; and may even feel like he's a failure.
[38:16] And men don't like to fall because God's
[38:20] designed men to may even experience
[38:23] feeling of
[38:26] an insecurity. And so all of this can
[38:28] become like a trial of baroness in his
[38:31] life.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[38:33] &gt;&gt; It's an every one of us in our life's
[38:35] journey, we have a certain experience in
[38:39] our journey that it seems like a
[38:42] baroness in our life.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be in our family
[38:47] uh family members, in our sibling
[38:50] groups, in our our workplace. We can
[38:52] encounter something that we struggle
[38:56] with
[38:57] and sometimes we feel that we are
[38:59] unproductive,
[39:01] uselessness, unfulfilled.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's bring a a a something
[39:07] a depression or something in our lives.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[39:11] And so there are many things that people
[39:13] can suffer from the effect of some form
[39:15] of botherness in their life.
[39:19] And then there's maybe some person is
[39:22] trying to get to to get uh some
[39:24] weaknesses in their life but cannot
[39:27] seems to overcome it. Each and every one
[39:30] of us has a weaknesses that we are
[39:32] trying to overcome and sometimes we
[39:34] cannot overcome it and sometime we come
[39:36] to the point that we question ourselves.
[39:39] Am
[39:42] I really saved? Am I really a son and
[39:44] daughters of God?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And so as we go along, as we go along
[39:49] our our lives, we are exposed to and
[39:53] become more aware of our own personal
[39:56] weaknesses.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; So our experience with God is just
[40:04] personal. Yes.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Only you know your weaknesses.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; As we travel in this life's journey, you
[40:13] know your weaknesses. And when you know
[40:15] your weaknesses, that's the good thing.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Because all things works together for
[40:19] good to them that love the Lord.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And it makes you more
[40:23] humble.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; It makes you become more merciful
[40:26] towards others.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Because it help us humble and in turn
[40:33] make us more merciful toward others who
[40:36] are struggling with their own struggle.
[40:38] Everybody is struggling.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; True. Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; So we notice that many women in the
[40:43] Bible that conceived and gave birth to
[40:46] children easily, they looked down on and
[40:49] in some cases mock those of the women
[40:51] who were barren.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Usually that is the case.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And this is just human nature. The
[41:00] attitude is that it is easy for me.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; So why is that easy for you?
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[41:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, you cannot compare your
[41:08] experience to others. That's right.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; But what is easy for one person who is
[41:15] not barren in one area of their life, it
[41:17] can be very hard for other person to
[41:20] conceive and bear fruit in that same
[41:22] area of life. Do you agree with that?
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so all of our life stories are
[41:27] different from each other
[41:30] &gt;&gt; with different struggle, different
[41:32] trouble. But the same God who is writing
[41:34] the mystery of his grace to one person
[41:37] &gt;&gt; is also writing the mystery of grace to
[41:40] another person.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; That is why we are not to look down on
[41:45] one another's person's struggle just
[41:48] because that is not our area of barness.
[41:51] Right?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Just like Paul wrote to a Galatian, he
[41:54] said in Galatians chapter 6 verse1, he
[41:57] said, "Brethren," in other words,
[41:59] brothers and sisters, listen, if a man
[42:02] be overtaken in fault, ye which are
[42:05] spiritual,
[42:06] &gt;&gt; restore sex and one in the spirit of
[42:09] meekness.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. considering thyself,
[42:14] &gt;&gt; considering thy own struggle,
[42:15] considering thy own trials,
[42:19] &gt;&gt; how God lift you up in the time that you
[42:21] are down.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; You need to consider that and apply it
[42:24] to others.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are just another
[42:28] human being with the same potential to
[42:30] fall under similar condition because of
[42:32] having the same human weaknesses. Right.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; So bear ye one another's burden and so
[42:39] fulfill the law of Christ.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And what is the law of Christ? Love one
[42:44] another.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Encourage one another. Amen. Hallelujah.
[42:48] For it himself to be something when he
[42:51] is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So that's the struggle
[42:58] in barness. And we can see that baroness
[43:01] is not permanent.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. is just for a season.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; That's why my title tonight is the
[43:07] season of baroness.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; We realize in reading the scripture that
[43:13] whenever there is a great promise of God
[43:16] about to fulfill, there is always a
[43:19] season of barness that is associated
[43:22] with the people of God that are
[43:24] connected to the fulfillment of the
[43:26] word. Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And because of this, there's a reproach
[43:33] that the people have to
[43:49] &gt;&gt; a season. Remember that we are
[44:07] nor sheep. from
[44:44] But they waited.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; How about Rebecca?
[45:03] We are a type of
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Rebecca was the answer to Elazar's
[45:09] prayer.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, Rebecca was blessed. He
[45:14] recognized her day and his messenger.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; He recognized the message of the hour.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And he meet Isaac.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; It seems a good fairy tale. And they
[45:27] live
[45:28] &gt;&gt; happily ever after. But it didn't happen
[45:31] that way,
[45:32] &gt;&gt; right? Come on.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Because she realized that she was
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Barent.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But then after all that great start to
[45:46] Rebecca's life, as the story goes on,
[45:48] she find out that she's barren woman.
[45:52] And then her whole world of what that
[45:54] seems like a perfect fairy tale of love
[45:56] story all of a sudden hallelujah to the
[45:59] way that it looks to her had become a
[46:01] dismal end just like we sometimes we can
[46:06] shout oh we received the message of the
[46:08] hour I followed the message of the hour
[46:10] we received the revelation of God amen
[46:14] that I am a part of him before the
[46:16] foundation of the word but then all of a
[46:18] sudden along your life's journey
[46:20] you experience in sometimes a season of
[46:23] barness.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; And then you become be tested
[46:29] &gt;&gt; your testimony that I am sons and
[46:31] daughters of God.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; You will be mocked. Where is the fruit
[46:35] that you are sons and daughters of God?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Where is it? Why are you sick? Why are
[46:40] you have trouble? Why are you this?
[46:42] Amen. What happened? What happened to be
[46:45] you being a sons and daughters of God?
[46:47] What happened your to your testimony
[46:49] that you are predestinated son and
[46:51] daughter to god
[46:52] &gt;&gt; but remember we are a son of the
[46:55] promise.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; We are the people of the promise
[46:59] &gt;&gt; and the scripture has a pattern in order
[47:02] for us to look upon
[47:04] &gt;&gt; because God never change his ways and
[47:06] his pattern. So what happened in our
[47:08] lives in our journey, we need to look it
[47:10] back into the word of God and look what
[47:13] God is doing
[47:16] during the time because there is always
[47:18] a season of barness
[47:19] &gt;&gt; in our life.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; But barness is not permanent.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But yet there was a great purpose that
[47:28] God had for placing that season of
[47:31] barness in her life.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Everything has a purpose.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember that not not only Sarah,
[47:37] praise God or Rebecca,
[47:40] Hallelujah, Rachel are barren, but there
[47:44] are seven women recorded that is barren.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Rachel was also barren. Hannah was
[47:51] barren. The mother of Samson, praise
[47:54] God, Noah was barren
[48:03] barren. Seven women,
[48:05] &gt;&gt; seven churches, seven seal and seven
[48:07] thunders.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; All of this we speak about the bride in
[48:11] these last days because we can identify
[48:13] our experience to the seven women in the
[48:17] old testament because they are shadows
[48:18] of reality in our day.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; So what God has been doing and
[48:26] hallelujah because God has a pattern he
[48:28] cannot change his pattern. We just need
[48:30] to recognize our position in these last
[48:32] days. Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so there must be a
[48:35] season will be the time of barrenness
[48:37] that take place just before the promise
[48:39] of God
[48:40] &gt;&gt; because baroness first before the
[48:44] promise being fulfilled.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And we see this showed in the lives of
[48:51] the seven women
[48:54] and suffer the reproach of barrenness
[48:57] for a season.
[49:00] as the prophet preached about the
[49:02] reproach for the cause of Christ or for
[49:05] the cause of the word that he preached
[49:07] in 1962.
[49:11] Baroness bring reproach.
[49:15] What's the scuffness of baroness? be his
[49:18] cup means to not to ridicule
[49:26] &gt;&gt; the approach of barrenness first was
[49:28] speaking about Miserah and they had see
[49:32] to stand their reproach of being barren
[49:35] for all those years she was nearly 100
[49:38] years old she was 90 but the word of God
[49:41] that said she would also be a princess
[49:44] of this child
[49:46] amen she will to be a princess. So she
[49:49] stand the her baroness for 25 years.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; She was 90 but the word of God said that
[49:59] she would also be the princess mother of
[50:01] his child. And she and Abraham baron
[50:03] both of their bodies as well as dead.
[50:05] But yet they never doubted that word one
[50:08] bit.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the key word because when
[50:13] God gave you the promise as a believer
[50:16] you hold on to the promise. But then you
[50:18] need to struggle
[50:21] in life. But God is testing your faith.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Not only is testing if you can pass or
[50:27] not, but testing means to manifest the
[50:29] faith that you receive. Because the
[50:31] scripture said Abraham and Sarah
[50:33] believed.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And it's counted for them for their
[50:39] righteousness.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But yet they never doubted
[50:43] that word one bit. But they had to stand
[50:45] it first. And then Hallelujah. God keep
[50:47] his word in the dark
[50:50] born
[50:52] and his seed is like the sand of the sea
[50:54] or the stars of heaven. God always
[50:57] answer
[50:59] his word.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:03] Baroness first then Isaac and we know
[51:06] that Isaac represent the new body in
[51:08] types. He's also
[51:10] a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he
[51:13] is the he is also a type of the of the
[51:15] the son of God coming to meet us in the
[51:17] air.
[51:24] She could rejoice over all that she had
[51:26] happened in her life. She met the the
[51:29] messenger of her day. She met Isaac.
[51:34] She was chosen. She was blessed. She had
[51:36] seen the supernatural guiding her right
[51:39] from her first encounter with Elizer at
[51:42] the evening time
[51:44] &gt;&gt; and all the way along her journey's life
[51:46] to her marriage to
[51:52] when you conclude it and they lived
[51:55] happily ever after.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; But then right after her marriage with
[52:02] Isaac then everything is to have gone
[52:04] wrong. Poor Rebecca because he had
[52:07] discovered that she was barren and all
[52:09] of her dreams of fulfillments to have
[52:11] disappeared in a pop of smoke
[52:18] journey. We are too blessed. We receive
[52:21] the message of the hour. We are now in
[52:24] the process of changing our bodies. We
[52:26] heard the voice. We heard the shout. But
[52:27] along life's journey
[52:31] sometimes
[52:36] we can say that am I really
[52:42] when trouble come I'm easily discouraged
[52:46] and suddenly mention my name do this he
[52:49] do that he do that I recently reacted
[52:56] &gt;&gt; individually you know what's what what
[52:59] you've been growing through.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And so Rebecca was sad because knowing
[53:07] that she was barren, she cannot produce
[53:10] exactly according to the promise.
[53:16] Rebecca was sad, Hannah was sad, Rachel
[53:19] was sad, and we also find ourselves sad
[53:21] during the time when we discover areas
[53:23] of life that burn for certain things.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; There is no excuse
[53:32] &gt;&gt; because as a as a bride of Jesus Christ,
[53:34] as a believer, we a season of baronness
[53:37] &gt;&gt; that we need to recognize in order for
[53:40] us to go through.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So baroness brings feelings of
[53:46] failure and unfulfillment and
[53:51] not designed to be said,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; right? And so this is why we find that
[53:56] many people would sometimes try to paint
[53:58] pregnancy
[54:00] and manufacture happiness in order to
[54:03] combat the sadness or barness that they
[54:05] are experiencing in their lives.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the message the resurrection
[54:10] of Jesus Christ
[54:14] uh he preached in 1956 and if you notice
[54:18] it's when you are discouraged that when
[54:20] the devil really can pour it on you.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:24] If you are experiencing this season of
[54:27] baroness in your life, you feel
[54:30] unfulfilled, you feel failure, you feel
[54:33] something that you are not productive.
[54:37] As the prophet said, it's when you are
[54:39] discouraged
[54:41] when the devil can really pour it out on
[54:44] you.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing he's watching. If
[54:48] you are discouraged in your journey,
[54:50] then he can pour out
[54:53] &gt;&gt; whatever he is in mind
[54:55] &gt;&gt; because it's only waiting
[54:57] &gt;&gt; for his great opportunity.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Remember that the devil don't die.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "Resist the devil
[55:08] and he will flee from you."
[55:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; He will just flee, but you he will not
[55:13] die.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; So when he flee, he will wait for
[55:16] another moment.
[55:18] and come back
[55:20] &gt;&gt; and give discouragement. That is his
[55:22] very purpose.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He cannot kill us but he can give us
[55:26] discouragement and fulfill praise God
[55:29] desperation in our lives.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; You can pour that's when he gets you. If
[55:36] you come to the church say well I don't
[55:38] know I don't know whether I'll get any
[55:41] better or not. I've been prayed for
[55:42] twice. Oh my. You might as well go home.
[55:44] That's all.
[55:48] If that is our attitude going to church
[55:51] &gt;&gt; as the prophets, you might as well go
[55:52] home.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; But as a believer of Christ, we come to
[55:57] church and we want God to speak unto us.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Whoever it be that stand in the pulpit,
[56:05] God is using that mouthpiece to speak
[56:07] unto his people. And whatever your
[56:09] needs,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; if you have the right mental attitude,
[56:13] &gt;&gt; when you come into the church, whatever,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; right mental attitude towards his
[56:21] promise,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; he will make it come to pass.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So whatever your needs while you come
[56:28] &gt;&gt; expecting that wherever two or three are
[56:30] gathered, he will be in our midst. You
[56:33] just need to have right mental attitude
[56:35] towards his promise and he will fulfill
[56:38] it
[56:39] &gt;&gt; because God hallelujah he will not meet
[56:42] God until he fulfill his own word.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; If you come to the church and say well I
[56:50] don't know I don't know.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You need to be specific when you come to
[56:55] church. Lord I want something from you
[56:57] tonight.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Lord I want something. I don't want to
[57:00] get out from this church being not being
[57:02] filled.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; I want to be fed. Lord,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I need to go to the church to be fed.
[57:08] Don't go to church. I don't know. I
[57:09] don't know. You just better be go home
[57:11] and sleep.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; What he's talking about? He is talking
[57:18] about a person who receive and believe
[57:21] the truth of the seed of the word of God
[57:23] but then their life seems to remain
[57:26] barren from the manifestations of the
[57:28] fruit of the promise of that word
[57:30] &gt;&gt; that is the sad part you have the right
[57:33] to be discouraged
[57:36] but when you can cast that aside
[57:40] &gt;&gt; you need to cast aside your reasoning
[57:42] cast aside your your idea cast aside
[57:45] your fear cast aside your feelings
[57:47] things. Cast aside your everything as
[57:50] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 10:4, casting
[57:53] down imagination
[57:56] &gt;&gt; and every high thing that exalted itself
[57:59] against the knowledge of God and
[58:01] bringing into captivity, every talk
[58:06] &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ the word.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Cast aside those feeling of uncertainty.
[58:12] Cast aside those feelings of fear. Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; God don't want you to be proning.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Are you happy tonight?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; If not, be happy.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Make a smile.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put you down.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you are in church, you
[58:36] need to be happy. This David said, "I'm
[58:38] so glad when they said that to me. Let
[58:40] us go into the house of the Lord
[58:42] &gt;&gt; because we have something to rejoice.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Not because brother Ron is here. No, we
[58:46] have to rejoice because our pastor is
[58:48] here. No, you need to rejoice because
[58:50] the word of God is our
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the word of anybody but his
[58:55] word. They are spirit and they are life.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And if there is life, there is an
[59:00] emotion.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; There is an amen. There is there is a
[59:05] smile.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your beautiful smile. I
[59:09] appreciate it.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy. The human
[59:15] heart was made to be happy.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet worry will
[59:22] cause cancer.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; If you have so be careful.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Not to worry too much
[59:33] &gt;&gt; because worry causes cancer. If you
[59:37] worries about sicknesses, go back to his
[59:39] word.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health all thy
[59:43] iniquity.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Remember your benefits.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; What is your benefits? Your healing,
[59:49] your overcoming everything.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Because God dies for you. Christ died
[59:54] for you and he said, "It is done. It is
[59:56] finished."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; And remember the benefits of how he gave
[1:00:00] his life for you.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He give you healing not only in
[1:00:03] your spirit realm, in your soul, in your
[1:00:06] physical.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Worry will cause cancer and temper will
[1:00:11] cause cancer. Don't never be upset.
[1:00:14] Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet is trying to show us that we
[1:00:23] need to recognize the season of barness
[1:00:26] in our life
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; so that we will not be worrying too
[1:00:30] much.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; When you worry too much sometimes your
[1:00:35] temper become
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; uh over overdose.
[1:00:43] Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Don't never be upset. Just walk in his
[1:00:50] love.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Just walk in his love. Amen. Say,
[1:00:54] knowing that you're walking in him,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; that is the key word
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; in our struggle, in our trials, in a
[1:01:02] barness that you feel your banners. This
[1:01:04] is the key word.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Knowing
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; that you're walking in him. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; How do you know that you're walking with
[1:01:11] him in the midst of your struggle and
[1:01:14] discouragement? You are still holding
[1:01:16] unto the promise of the word. That is
[1:01:18] that you know that you're still walking
[1:01:20] in Christ.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Knowing means hallelujah recognizing
[1:01:24] your day.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Remember he never leave you nor forsake
[1:01:28] you. You need to recognize
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; and realizing and perceiving
[1:01:34] understanding that we are already in
[1:01:37] him. Amen. Thank you.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Not we will be but we are in him
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the word.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And even King Solomon catch the
[1:01:48] revelation of his relationship with his
[1:01:52] God.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22
[1:01:59] he said the Lord possessed me in the
[1:02:01] beginning.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] beginning of his ways before his works
[1:02:08] of old.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] King Solomon already saw himself with
[1:02:15] his creator.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I was set. The Lord possessed me in the
[1:02:21] beginning. In other words, I am with him
[1:02:24] in the beginning.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of his way before his old
[1:02:29] works. I was set up from everlasting
[1:02:32] from the beginning or the ever the earth
[1:02:35] was
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; and greater than Solomon was here. And
[1:02:39] he said before the earth was created
[1:02:41] before there was atom before there was a
[1:02:43] bullet kill I was already in his mind
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; because I am part hallelujah of his
[1:02:49] attributes I was already in him.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord. And Colon 8 verse 24,
[1:02:56] when there was no depths, I was brought
[1:02:59] forth. And when there was no fountains
[1:03:01] abounding with water, before the
[1:03:03] mountains were settled, before the
[1:03:05] hills, I was brought forth.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Before the
[1:03:11] mountains were settled, before the hills
[1:03:13] was I brought forth,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; while as yet he had not made the earth,
[1:03:17] nor the fields, nor the highest part of
[1:03:19] the dust of the word, when he prepared
[1:03:21] the heavens, I was there. Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he set a compass upon
[1:03:27] the face of the earth or the depth.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; When he established the clouds above,
[1:03:34] when he strengthened the fountains of
[1:03:35] the deep. When he gave to the sea his
[1:03:38] decree that the waters should not pass
[1:03:40] his commandment, when he appointed the
[1:03:42] fountains of the earth, then I was by
[1:03:45] him
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; as one brought up with him. I was daily
[1:03:50] his delight rejoicing always before me.
[1:03:53] I was his delight.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Are you
[1:03:58] glad to be a Christian?"
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're glad to be a
[1:04:01] Christian, it is not our old will, but
[1:04:04] it is God's desire for us to be a
[1:04:06] Christian.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; As Solomon said, I was by him and one
[1:04:10] brought with him and I was daily. I was
[1:04:13] daily his delight.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing always before him.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said, "Knowing that you're
[1:04:22] walking in him
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; because we are his daily delight."
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And nothing can harm you.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; How can the devil harm you be? Because
[1:04:39] you are already in him
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world,
[1:04:44] before he created the mountain, the
[1:04:45] hill, everything
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; that we can see around here. We are
[1:04:49] already in him. Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And the Lord possess me
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; and the Lord possess us.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Speaking about eternal security. He
[1:05:00] already possess us.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; A sense of security. We are in walking
[1:05:04] in the word of God.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; No one can harm us.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Who can harm us? Satan cannot harm us.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; He need to ask permission first.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:05:18] So it's his business to take care of
[1:05:21] what he took himself.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Remember when the seal was open,
[1:05:27] the mighty angel come came down with an
[1:05:30] open book and he revealed the content of
[1:05:33] the book
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; and the content of the book is our name
[1:05:36] written in the book.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; How do we know that our name is God? The
[1:05:39] mystery is being shown to you.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And you responded to the mystery of this
[1:05:44] day.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The mystery is you. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; The mystery is you and I.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; We saw our name in the book.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he said that it's
[1:05:55] his business to take care of what he
[1:05:58] took himself at the opening of the
[1:06:00] seventh seal.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He said that he gathered his subject
[1:06:05] unto himself.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; And who he is his subject? The blood of
[1:06:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That is the very purpose that he came
[1:06:12] down, open the book and restore to us.
[1:06:14] Yes,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; it's his business to take care of us
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; because when he opened the seven seal,
[1:06:20] he gathered all
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; he subject the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:24] So, he's taking care of us.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Remember, he never go back.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; When he came down,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; he put his feet upon the sand in the
[1:06:33] land
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; in the sea in the land and said, "It is
[1:06:36] done. It is finished."
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; No one can harm us.
[1:06:42] No man can pluck them from my father's
[1:06:44] hand.
[1:06:46] No one can pluck them from my father's
[1:06:48] hand.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Remember that eternal security. You are
[1:06:53] sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Because no other one, no other man
[1:06:58] sealed you. But it was the Holy Ghost
[1:07:00] that sealed you.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; No one can flock you out from my from my
[1:07:10] No one can pluck them from my father's
[1:07:12] hand cuz there's nothing can harm you.
[1:07:14] There's neither power,
[1:07:18] earthly rulers, spiritual forces can
[1:07:22] override God's promises.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot override the
[1:07:26] promises of God. Maybe if your p failure
[1:07:29] or whatsoever things that you struggle,
[1:07:32] he cannot override what's God's
[1:07:33] promises. That's why no power, ruler and
[1:07:36] darkness word, praise God that separate
[1:07:38] you from the love of God.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Things present, things future, nothing
[1:07:45] can separate us from him.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; No current hardship, no future
[1:07:50] uncertainty can interfere. We are in
[1:07:54] him.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; So whatever the situation now, there
[1:07:57] will be a lot of riess and everything.
[1:08:00] But praise
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; God
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; we will not be discouraged.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing future nothing praise God
[1:08:10] present future can separate us from the
[1:08:12] love of God.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; No hardship of the future uncertainty
[1:08:16] can separate us from the love of God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; We are in him
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and we never come in by our own will.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Remember no we don't we
[1:08:29] don't look for God but God is looking
[1:08:30] for us.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; That's why even though we are in the
[1:08:36] season of barness remember that we are
[1:08:40] already blessed by just recognizing who
[1:08:43] we are
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And we never come in by our own will. He
[1:08:49] by choice.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He has no choice. He by choice elected
[1:08:56] us and brought in to him. It was his
[1:09:00] choice.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No one dictate him.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was his choice
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; and elected us unto himself.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the greatest of all them.
[1:09:15] It's the father who take cares of it.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Who got any more power than God? So what
[1:09:20] kind of power have you got over you to
[1:09:22] take care of you? What kind of power is
[1:09:25] taking care of you?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; The whole power that's created the
[1:09:30] universe.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we cannot say amen as if
[1:09:34] we are not really convinced.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe the first time you heard it but
[1:09:42] when you go home you meditate it and
[1:09:44] thank God for it.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That he called us.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Separate us. Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:52] Because the power that created the
[1:09:54] universe, don't look at your present
[1:09:57] situation that you cannot appreciate
[1:09:58] what he has done for you.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes if you look and
[1:10:04] compare yourself to others,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; that's the time that Satan
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; want to come in.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Don't compare yourself to others. Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; May it be material, but compare yourself
[1:10:20] to the word.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And the word said you are sons and
[1:10:23] daughters of God.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You are washed by the blood of Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ. You are sanctified by the blood
[1:10:28] of Jesus Christ. You are washed by the
[1:10:30] washing of the word of God.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to compare yourself
[1:10:35] by in the word, not on somebody else.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And you begin, praise God, to meditate
[1:10:44] upon who you are.
[1:10:46] Because if you know who you are, then
[1:10:48] you can act accordingly.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Remember that the brother Brandon's
[1:10:52] parable about the black slave.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; He was slave. They ate the same. They
[1:10:59] they sleep the same. But he act
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; different from all the slaves.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Although they ate the same, they they
[1:11:07] been treated the same. But because he
[1:11:10] knows who he is,
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; he was the prince in their tribe. So he
[1:11:15] act accordingly according to the
[1:11:17] knowledge of who he is.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's why if you know you are sons and
[1:11:21] daughters of God, don't look and compare
[1:11:23] your others
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; to some others but compare yourself to
[1:11:27] the word of God because you are
[1:11:28] predestinated sons and daughters of God.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; You act different.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Don't compare yourself to others because
[1:11:35] all these material things are temporary.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Look yourself to the word of God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Enjoy being sons and
[1:11:42] daughters of God.
[1:11:44] Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And took the solar system and blew that
[1:11:52] and every star went to its place as sure
[1:11:54] and he watches over you. Amen. That's
[1:11:56] the kind of father we have.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; A good job.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe you cannot comprehend.
[1:12:05] Just go home and read the word and
[1:12:08] meditate
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; how grateful we are.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the greater power who
[1:12:14] created all the solars and universe is
[1:12:16] in you.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; And no one can separate you from that
[1:12:21] power.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; So as a believer, we must realize that
[1:12:30] there is a season
[1:12:32] of barrenness before the promise of God
[1:12:35] is fulfilled. And there is a necessity
[1:12:37] of a reproach of barness that we will
[1:12:39] have to bear for the cause of the word.
[1:12:43] Hallelujah. We have a pattern to look
[1:12:45] at.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; So that's why we need to recognize we
[1:12:49] are sons. Okay. We have a season of
[1:12:51] barness in our life.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be despared. Many will show
[1:12:57] their colors during this barness and
[1:13:00] season of life. You receive the message.
[1:13:02] You make you you claim your sons and
[1:13:04] daughters of God. You claim you are
[1:13:06] proinate but along life's journey it
[1:13:09] seems that your life is unproductive
[1:13:13] and many will show the colors and drop
[1:13:15] off in their faith
[1:13:18] because actually their faith was based
[1:13:21] upon the reasoning of the word
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; rather than revelations of the word of
[1:13:26] God revealed to them by the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; As brother said if the if someone put
[1:13:31] you in somebody will put you out. That's
[1:13:34] right.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; But the bride of Jesus Christ is based
[1:13:38] upon the revelation.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And upon this rock of revelation, I will
[1:13:42] build my church.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And no one can can pluck you
[1:13:46] in and you pluck it out because it the
[1:13:48] Holy Ghost that make the foundation upon
[1:13:51] this rock of revelation,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:13:55] it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You will stand. If you can stand alone,
[1:13:58] you will stand still. Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And so because of this problem of
[1:14:02] baroness
[1:14:04] that we have seen over the years, there
[1:14:06] has been such a pressure
[1:14:08] on maybe many ministers or churches in
[1:14:11] the message to try to prove some form of
[1:14:14] proof
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; or manifestation of pregnancy and life
[1:14:18] in the churches.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] That's why when brother Ron preached
[1:14:25] about
[1:14:27] those altar calls
[1:14:29] those emotion we believe in all that and
[1:14:32] agree with brother wrong
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; because without
[1:14:37] because if the spirit of God is in it we
[1:14:40] can feel we can express our emotion.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] But we don't make it a tradition that
[1:14:48] every service there's an alcohol, every
[1:14:50] service there's somebody running, every
[1:14:52] service there is shouting and dance,
[1:14:54] every service. No, that's become
[1:14:57] sometimes they don't have the revelation
[1:14:59] and they and they and they go in that
[1:15:02] direction just to prove oh we are alive
[1:15:04] and we are alive and they just mock
[1:15:06] those who don't have that kind. Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Are we are they only vindicated because
[1:15:12] in our church there is a there is a
[1:15:14] jumping and shouting and altar call and
[1:15:16] all these mighty signs the pillar of
[1:15:18] fire.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; But for the real bride we are just
[1:15:23] feeding upon the revealed word of the
[1:15:24] hour. Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; We may not
[1:15:29] jump and shout and soever but I believe
[1:15:32] every word we are watching every word
[1:15:34] that we receive
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; because the revival of the bride is by
[1:15:38] the revelation of the word not by
[1:15:41] emotion or champing and dancing
[1:15:43] whatsoever. We believe in all of that,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; but I rather have the revealed word
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; that we live up
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; our faith a little bit higher.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Not a little bit, but full.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Come have Jen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And I will show you things that's to
[1:16:02] come.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; That is our revival. The things that is
[1:16:06] to come.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Some will maybe shout yam around the
[1:16:13] church building that is okay if it's
[1:16:14] done in a genuine way.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; We believe in all of that as brother Ron
[1:16:18] preaches beautifully about that and
[1:16:21] maybe somebody is against that. Oh,
[1:16:23] brother Ron is not preaching that or
[1:16:25] right. No, we believe in all of that.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; But we don't make it a tradition.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; We believe in the genuine moving of the
[1:16:34] Holy Ghost.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; But I rather have the word of God being
[1:16:38] preached to us
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; than those emotions.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So nobody wants to be sad because of
[1:16:47] being married woman that is receiving
[1:16:49] seed but is not bringing forth life.
[1:16:52] Amen. So a woman is a receiving the
[1:16:55] message but there was no life.
[1:16:58] So that's impersonated. They make it
[1:16:59] something that they are alive and
[1:17:01] produces that they are alive.
[1:17:05] And then you will sometimes see that
[1:17:07] this same one will often look down upon
[1:17:09] even mock of those of whom they consider
[1:17:11] to be barren.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Ah there was no shouting there speaking
[1:17:15] time. There's no healing. Ah there's
[1:17:17] barren church. No vindication.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That is really
[1:17:22] the evil that we are now in the last
[1:17:24] days.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] Second Peter 3:4, he said, "Knowing this
[1:17:30] first,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; that there shall come in the last days
[1:17:34] scoffers walking after their own lust,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; walking after their own interpretations
[1:17:39] about the message of the hour,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; and saying, where is the promise of his
[1:17:44] coming? For since the father fell
[1:17:47] asleep, all things continue as they were
[1:17:50] from the beginning of the creation."
[1:17:53] And so we must realize and accept that
[1:17:55] there will of necessity be a scoffer in
[1:17:57] the message. Do you agree?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Because it was a prophecy that in the
[1:18:01] last days there will be scoffers.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; True
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; of the message of this hour that will
[1:18:06] rise up because one of the mysteries
[1:18:08] that the message open up to us in the
[1:18:11] mystery of the coming of the Lord
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; and that mystery will only be made known
[1:18:16] to an elected group of people.
[1:18:19] No one can recognize the coming of the
[1:18:22] Lord.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Only the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's why we can say special class of
[1:18:28] people.
[1:18:31] When it comes to salvation,
[1:18:34] everybody have the opportunity to be
[1:18:36] saved because God so loved the world
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:18:44] whosoever believeth in him.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; He not bearest but come unto repentance.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a chance.
[1:18:54] But to sit on the throne, it will be
[1:18:56] just an elected group of people
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; which is called the bride.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; So we must realize the mystery will be
[1:19:05] known to an unelected group. So from
[1:19:07] Sarah to Elizabeth, every one of these
[1:19:10] seven seven women in the Bible are
[1:19:12] showing us in type
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; a different portion of the mystery of
[1:19:18] the barren woman in these last days at
[1:19:20] the harvest time. Because each of these
[1:19:22] women barness preceded the coming of
[1:19:25] Christ in type.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Sarah Barness came before the coming of
[1:19:32] Isaac.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; So Isaac was the promised son which is
[1:19:35] type of Christ.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Rebecca Barnes came Jacob
[1:19:42] and Jacob was the father of 12 pretaks
[1:19:45] which is a type of Christ our father.
[1:19:49] Rachel Barnes came Joseph and Joseph is
[1:19:51] a perfect type of God. In Joseph there
[1:19:54] is perfection.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; After Hannah's Barness came Samuel
[1:20:00] which when he was rejected God said that
[1:20:02] it wasn't Samuel that they were rejected
[1:20:05] but it was God
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; that they were rejected
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; because prophet represent God to the
[1:20:11] people.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the coming of Christ,
[1:20:15] the coming of God because the prophet
[1:20:18] introduced
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; God to the people.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And Manoah's wife Barnes was over. She
[1:20:26] gave birth to Samson. And we know that
[1:20:29] Samson was the one who died between the
[1:20:31] two pillars.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; With his arm outreach or who gave his
[1:20:36] life freely in order to bring victory to
[1:20:39] his people. Just like Christ on the
[1:20:41] cross who died with his arm outreach
[1:20:43] between two thieves to bring victory to
[1:20:45] his people. It is done. It is finished.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; When the Shunomite woman Barnes was
[1:20:51] over, she gave birth to the promised son
[1:20:53] that came the prophecy of Elisha of whom
[1:20:56] then died and then was risen back to
[1:20:58] life again. Type of Christ, death,
[1:21:00] burial, and resurrection. Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; When Elizabeth Baroness came, John the
[1:21:06] Baptist, the very forerunner of Christ,
[1:21:09] whose ministry was to make the pathway,
[1:21:11] prepare the way for Christ.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; So everything that comes our way had a
[1:21:18] purpose in our life.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Our barness shows something
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; of Christ in the bride.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:21:27] So and all these barren women were
[1:21:29] showing of a prophecy of the end time
[1:21:32] hour of great gentile church woman that
[1:21:34] has been barren for a long time and that
[1:21:36] endure the reproach of barrenness. Amen.
[1:21:40] Before the coming of Christ of which she
[1:21:41] has been promised to give birth to the
[1:21:43] word of this hour by being uniting with
[1:21:46] the word under the ministry of Elisha's
[1:21:48] anointing.
[1:21:50] So this overshadowing of an angel with a
[1:21:52] message is that is what is producing the
[1:21:55] coming of the promised son.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the angel overshadowing
[1:22:00] Mary, it produced Christ.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; So we have angel in these last days
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; that will produce Christ in each and
[1:22:07] every one of us.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; In the message it is the rising of the
[1:22:12] sun, the last coat. So I told you I will
[1:22:15] not hold you too long. So,
[1:22:18] and he being the groom,
[1:22:20] the bride has to come forth.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Has to come forth.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Because this we are now living at the
[1:22:28] end of the age.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; All the mystery of God is being
[1:22:31] revealed.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; So, it is the rising of the sun. So, our
[1:22:36] maturity now is in the rising of the son
[1:22:38] of man ministry.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. is no longer under the seven
[1:22:41] church candlestick
[1:22:43] because the candle light cannot produce
[1:22:46] maturity in the bride.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; So it is the rising of the sun.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; The rising of the son of man in these
[1:22:52] last days. So we are feeding
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; on the word body of the son of man
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; in these last days
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; to take away all the gness out of us.
[1:23:02] Amen.
[1:23:03] We are no longer preaching about do
[1:23:05] this, do that, do this, do that. But we
[1:23:07] are preaching about knowing who we are.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Because you know, if we know who we
[1:23:13] where we came from, we know where we're
[1:23:14] going.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; We can act according to the revelation
[1:23:18] that we are sons and daughters of God,
[1:23:20] we will not become son, but we are
[1:23:22] already son.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the word, we
[1:23:27] just recognize take away the amia in our
[1:23:30] lives.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes before we recite the
[1:23:34] message, we jump from one church to
[1:23:36] another because there was something in
[1:23:37] our heart looking for something
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; very familiar that we we jump from
[1:23:41] Baptist to every church that we But then
[1:23:43] one day, hallelujah, there was a shout
[1:23:46] that let us know who we are and we
[1:23:49] recognize that we are sons and
[1:23:50] daughters. Take away the amnesia. Yes.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And then I said, "Where were you when I
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Where were you when I when I created the
[1:24:01] the foundation of the world?" Where sons
[1:24:02] and daughters of God are shouting for
[1:24:04] joy.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he being the groom, the
[1:24:08] bride has to come forth because it's
[1:24:10] part of him.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; We are feeding upon the son of men
[1:24:15] ministry.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] It was not his message but it was the
[1:24:21] message of the son of man
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; and it came only be the manifestations
[1:24:28] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:24:32] any other has to spoke of the bride.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Look at what he is saying here. All the
[1:24:39] woman in the Bible that represented the
[1:24:42] end time bride of his hour. This
[1:24:44] anti-ribe can only be the manifestation
[1:24:47] of all the revelations of all other
[1:24:49] women in the Bible.
[1:24:52] If Christ
[1:24:55] is hidden in the volumes of the book,
[1:24:58] then the bride is also hidden in the
[1:25:00] volumes of the book.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; All the women in the Old Testament is
[1:25:05] just a shadow of what will be the
[1:25:08] manifestations of the bride in these
[1:25:10] last days.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Their journey is our journey. Their
[1:25:14] experience is our experience. We can
[1:25:17] identify ourselves by each and every one
[1:25:19] of them
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; because it was Christ in them. As the
[1:25:23] prophet said, it was Christ in Moses. It
[1:25:26] was Christ in David. It was Christ in
[1:25:28] Elijah. It was Christ in Daniel. It was
[1:25:31] Christ in Luther. It was Christ in
[1:25:33] Wesley. It was Christ in. Now, it was
[1:25:35] Christ to the bride.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are just the
[1:25:39] manifestation of those shadows. And we
[1:25:42] are the prophecy the reality of those
[1:25:45] shallow in this lifetime.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; It seems that anybody and not and not
[1:25:51] everybody's enjoying it but it's just
[1:25:53] okay because God has a time and season
[1:25:56] to reveal himself.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; We are not in a hurry because everything
[1:26:01] is under control.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Everything has a season and a time
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; that he can grow. Not everybody grow
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; the same. That's right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; What we do is just we just preach the
[1:26:15] word
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; because the word of God is a spirit and
[1:26:18] they are life.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; If you are a seed, there will be a a
[1:26:21] release of the anointing to quicken that
[1:26:24] seed.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, let every seed
[1:26:27] bring forth to be kind and it was
[1:26:29] already being spoken. So shall it be
[1:26:32] done.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; That was the anointing that is being
[1:26:35] released. So if you are a seed of God,
[1:26:37] whether you like it or not, you will
[1:26:39] come to the understanding of who you
[1:26:41] are.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; No excuse.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; If you cannot receive it,
[1:26:52] then maybe you're not part of it. But if
[1:26:55] you are part of it, you will come
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; to the word of God.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And you cannot help yourself.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Even you try to run or forsake it.
[1:27:05] Hallelujah. You cannot forsake it
[1:27:07] because you are part of the word. How
[1:27:08] can you forsake that you are part of the
[1:27:10] word?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; It can only manifest
[1:27:19] if it does something different from the
[1:27:21] groom. It isn't the bride because she is
[1:27:23] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,
[1:27:25] life of his life, power of his power.
[1:27:27] She is him.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Eve was actually just
[1:27:32] Adam in bride form
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; and Adam was Eve in bridegroom form
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; because they were both
[1:27:46] a part of one spirit and one flesh
[1:27:49] because he was part of Adam's spirit and
[1:27:51] also a part of Adam's flesh.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; By being created from his rib.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it took both Adam and Eve
[1:27:59] to both manifest in order to fully
[1:28:01] reveal the full mystery of one body of
[1:28:04] Adam which was both masculine and
[1:28:06] feminine. So we have the message Christ
[1:28:08] is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; But Christ is not fully revealed unless
[1:28:13] the bride is revealed.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Now that the bride is already being
[1:28:17] revealed, it's time to go home.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "And men and
[1:28:24] women are one. The woman taken from his
[1:28:27] side. She had taken a spirit, the
[1:28:29] feminine spirit from him. The flesh from
[1:28:32] his side made both mechanics and
[1:28:34] dynamics. The wife, the spirit of him
[1:28:37] and the flesh of him put it together and
[1:28:39] made mechanics and dynamics.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; We have arrived.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; They said that this is the turning
[1:28:47] point.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; But we have reached the point of no
[1:28:50] return.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; We are not turning. We have already
[1:28:54] turned a long time ago.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; We have turned from denomination
[1:28:58] understanding. We have turned from
[1:28:59] man-made ideas understanding. We have
[1:29:02] now reached the point of no return
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; because we have already heard the shout,
[1:29:06] the voice and we are waiting for the
[1:29:08] trump which is the changing of our body.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are now in the process
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; of changing our body.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; We are no longer turning corners. We
[1:29:18] have already turned a long time ago.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We have recognized our
[1:29:22] day, our message, our time. And we have
[1:29:25] reached the point of no return. We are
[1:29:27] lonely waiting for the trump. And in the
[1:29:30] last days, the trump of God, we are now
[1:29:32] gathering
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; together in Christ Jesus.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will be united by the
[1:29:39] love of God.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; In this last day, shall we stand?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that this short sermon
[1:29:46] will give an encourage to each and every
[1:29:48] one of us. Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; If you cannot grasp it, just
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; just meditate on this word.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5:13 to him. For we are
[1:29:58] members of his body,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; of his flesh, and of his bone.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; For this cause shall a man leave his
[1:30:06] father and mother, and shall be joined
[1:30:08] unto his wife, and they too shall be
[1:30:11] one.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; But I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:30:17] church. Oh hallelujah.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; The greatest mystery is between Christ
[1:30:22] and his church being revealed in this
[1:30:24] last day. God bless you everybody.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Praise you Lord.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Yeah.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; When you begin to see there was a season
[1:30:39] of barrenness
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; and every time in those seven women, you
[1:30:43] see that there must have been a time of
[1:30:47] mental struggle
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; for those that were recipients of the
[1:30:54] word yet didn't see it manifest when
[1:30:57] they thought it should manifest.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; So there must have been struggles.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Who am I? I thought God said
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; year after year it's not happening. It's
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; you know
[1:31:13] but
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; whenever you see an Adam look for an
[1:31:18] Eve.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Whenever you see an Abraham look for a
[1:31:22] Sarah.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that principle?
[1:31:28] Because when she comes on the scene, she
[1:31:31] is just revealing there's another one
[1:31:33] there that's calling her.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; So
[1:31:44] at the time when it looked like an
[1:31:47] impossibility,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; God said, "Are you done?
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out.
[1:31:55] Don't try to manufacture it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what. I have a I
[1:32:00] have a handmade.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And even if I can't do it, perhaps
[1:32:07] Hagar. Yeah, that'll be it. Ishmael, may
[1:32:11] he live and be my No, it ain't Ishmael.
[1:32:14] It's Isaac.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; God had to rebuke him.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Hey, so many times we try to figure it
[1:32:23] out. Hey, listen. You don't have to
[1:32:26] manufacture it.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And in the time of impossibility, in the
[1:32:32] time when everything seems to be, oh,
[1:32:35] when uh Abraham was as good as dead and
[1:32:38] his wife was good as dead and it looked
[1:32:40] like no possibility, God says, "Okay,
[1:32:43] are you done?" No. Stand back and see
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; see the God come on the scene. I will
[1:32:50] produce it.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; It's all about him.
[1:32:54] It's all about him. What What are they
[1:32:56] playing here?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Let your word be born.
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Beaten and warm
[1:33:06] hardly
[1:33:07] a place
[1:33:09] for a king to be born.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Choose some place special
[1:33:18] to reveal his majesty.
[1:33:22] Oh, I know. I give him control.
[1:33:27] He'll be born in me.
[1:33:31] Let your word
[1:33:35] be born
[1:33:37] in the manger of my heart.
[1:33:42] Let it live in me.
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:50] living inside this house of clay
[1:33:54] and mold it every day.
[1:33:59] Let your word be born
[1:34:03] in the manger
[1:34:05] of my heart.
[1:34:09] Oh, outward
[1:34:11] and outwardly
[1:34:13] on nothing.
[1:34:15] Not much to behold,
[1:34:20] unlike
[1:34:22] a place
[1:34:24] for his work to unfold.
[1:34:28] But I'll just yield this vessel
[1:34:32] and let him have his way
[1:34:36] from glory
[1:34:38] to glory.
[1:34:41] He'll change me day by day.
[1:34:46] Your word
[1:34:49] be born
[1:34:51] in the manger of my heart.
[1:34:56] Let it live in me. Let it start
[1:35:03] live inside this house of clay
[1:35:07] and mold it every day.
[1:35:12] Let your word be born
[1:35:16] in the manger
[1:35:18] of my heart.
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:25] You know, when you look at the word of
[1:35:26] God
[1:35:29] and you see the supernatural events,
[1:35:34] angels appearing to Mary,
[1:35:37] blessed art thou Mary among all women,
[1:35:41] for God hath chosen you. You found favor
[1:35:43] in his eyes,
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and God has chosen you to be an
[1:35:50] appointed vessel
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; to bring forth the Messiah. Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And she pondered
[1:35:57] those things in her heart at the
[1:36:00] salutation of this angel."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Don't we ponder?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Don't we struggle with it?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And you know, the word could not
[1:36:12] pregnantate that and bring it to bring
[1:36:15] it to fruition until she said these
[1:36:18] words,
[1:36:20] "Be it unto me.
[1:36:23] according to thy word. Don't figure it
[1:36:26] out, saints. Don't try to manufacture
[1:36:28] it. Just say these words, be it unto me.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; According to thy word.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; It's all about him.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And just surrendering and let your
[1:36:41] vessel
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; be yielded to him. Amen. Heavenly
[1:36:46] Father, I thank you for this word
[1:36:47] tonight, reminding us, Father, of our
[1:36:50] humanity and carnality so much of the
[1:36:53] time and a time of barrenness when we
[1:36:56] wonder, is it really true? Will it
[1:36:59] really happen? Oh,
[1:37:02] I've waited for so long and it hasn't
[1:37:05] happened.
[1:37:07] Maybe I need to manufacture it. Maybe ah
[1:37:10] maybe I'll give this promise off to
[1:37:13] another bosom and to another womb. No,
[1:37:17] father. But let us say, all right, I see
[1:37:22] it's all up to God. So therefore, I will
[1:37:25] do as Ruth did. I will rest. I will lay
[1:37:29] my
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; self at your feet until there's a rising
[1:37:35] of the sun. And Boaz says, "Stay here.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Stay here until the rise." Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] Hallelujah.
[1:37:46] Because this is the time of the kinsman
[1:37:49] redeemer to make himself known to come
[1:37:52] before the elders, take off his shoe and
[1:37:55] to redeem. Father, we thank you. We
[1:37:58] thank you for all the things that we see
[1:38:00] that are happening around the world that
[1:38:02] you have given us the of understanding.
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:07] The world looks at just events and
[1:38:10] happenings and I'm sure it was no
[1:38:13] different than the days of Jesus Christ
[1:38:16] when your word was being fulfilled and
[1:38:19] they crucified
[1:38:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:38:24] They wondered
[1:38:26] until even a centurion when lightning
[1:38:30] flashed
[1:38:31] there was darkness about the midday when
[1:38:34] he gave up the ghost
[1:38:36] and he said truly this was
[1:38:40] the son of God.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Father God I pray for the revelation of
[1:38:46] the Holy Spirit upon each and every one
[1:38:48] because father it's only you that can
[1:38:50] open our eyes.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Father, I pray may we
[1:38:53] embrace the promise. Never doubt or have
[1:38:57] any kind of unbelief, but say, "Father,
[1:39:00] be it unto me according to thy word." I
[1:39:02] thank you. I praise you. May we ponder
[1:39:04] these things tonight as we go home, as
[1:39:08] you lay on your pillow. Quit looking at
[1:39:10] yourself, but look to the promise.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; God will bring his word to pass. He will
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; in its season.
[1:39:19] Father, I thank you and I praise you in
[1:39:21] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. That means so
[1:39:30] be it. Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; That means so be it. God bless you.
[1:39:35] We'll consider ourselves dismissed.
[1:39:37] We'll sing one uh one more song. Do you
[1:39:39] have a song in your heart there, Brother
[1:39:41] Gray?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Um made me glad.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; He has made me glad.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:48] Are you glad? He said, if if you've
[1:39:50] received the word, you're happy,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; huh? Are you going to sit there and
[1:39:53] frown and and woe is me and and be like
[1:39:57] little Tigger and and you know or Eeyore
[1:40:01] or that? Yeah, I think it's Eeyore. Huh,
[1:40:03] Andy? It's Eeyore. They got a little
[1:40:04] black cloud and it's raining. Woe is me.
[1:40:07] What?
[1:40:09] Hey, no. Come on. Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Let's get a little joy in our heart, a
[1:40:13] little smile on our face,
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; and I I will bless the Lord forever.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's take a moment right now and
[1:40:21] let's bless the Lord with our voice
[1:40:24] together, Jesus.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; I willless
[1:40:28] bless the Lord forever.
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:35] And I will
[1:40:38] bless you at all times.
[1:40:44] And he has delivered me from all fear.
[1:40:55] And he has
[1:40:58] set my feet upon a rock.
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:04] And I will not be moved.
[1:41:10] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my
[1:41:14] shield.
[1:41:16] You're my strength.
[1:41:19] You're my portion.
[1:41:22] Deliverer,
[1:41:24] my shelter,
[1:41:26] strong tower,
[1:41:29] my very present. help in time of need.
[1:41:38] And who have
[1:41:41] I inherited
[1:41:44] but you
[1:41:49] there's none that I desire beside you
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] and you have made me glad.
[1:42:03] And I'll say of the Lord, you are my
[1:42:08] shield.
[1:42:10] You're my strength,
[1:42:12] my portion,
[1:42:15] deliverer,
[1:42:17] my shelter,
[1:42:20] strong tower,
[1:42:22] my very present,
[1:42:25] help in time of need.
[1:42:30] You are my shield.
[1:42:34] You're my strength,
[1:42:37] my portion.
[1:42:39] Deliverer,
[1:42:41] my shelter,
[1:42:44] strong tower,
[1:42:46] my very present, helping in time of
[1:42:51] need.
[1:42:56] Amen. It's been good to be in the house
[1:42:58] of the Lord tonight.
[1:43:00] Amen. God bless you all. You're
[1:43:02] dismissed tonight. Go in Jesus name.
