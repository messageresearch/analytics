[0:00] [Music]
[0:18] Oh.
[0:19] [Music]
[0:31] [Applause]
[0:34] [Music]
[1:12] Okay.
[1:22] [Music]
[2:22] And all my life you have been
[2:29] faithful. And all my life you have been
[2:33] so so good.
[2:38] With every breath that I am
[2:43] able, I will sing of the goodness. Let's
[2:48] stand as we sing the first
[2:50] verse. I love you,
[2:55] Lord, for your mercy never fails
[3:00] me. All my days I've been held in your
[3:06] hand.
[3:10] [Music]
[3:13] Till I lay my
[3:16] head, I will sing of the
[3:20] goodness of
[3:25] God. And all my life you have been
[3:30] [Music]
[3:33] faithful. And all my life you have been
[3:37] so so
[3:41] good. With every breath that I am
[3:46] [Music]
[3:47] able, I will sing of the
[3:51] goodness of
[3:55] God. I love your
[3:59] voice. You have led me through the fire.
[4:05] In the darkest night, you are close like
[4:10] no
[4:12] other. I've known you as a
[4:16] father. I've known you as a
[4:20] friend and I have lived in the
[4:24] goodness of God.
[4:30] And all my life you have been
[4:37] faithful. And all my life you have been
[4:41] so so
[4:45] good. With every breath that I am
[4:51] able, I will sing of the goodness. His
[4:56] goodness is running after
[5:00] me. Your goodness is running after.
[5:04] Running after
[5:08] me. Your goodness is running after
[5:12] running after
[5:14] me. With my life laid down. Surrender
[5:18] now. I give you
[5:21] [Music]
[5:25] everything. Running after you, running
[5:28] after. All my life you've been
[5:33] faithful. And all my life you have been
[5:41] faithful. And all my life you have been
[5:45] so so good.
[5:49] With every breath that I am
[5:54] able, I will
[5:57] sing of the
[5:59] goodness of
[6:01] God. Thank you, Lord, for your goodness
[6:04] tonight. We serve a great and a mighty
[6:07] God
[6:08] tonight. Thank you that your goodness,
[6:11] your mercy is running after me.
[6:14] So thankful that he came looking for me
[6:16] in my time of need. Amen. We serve a
[6:19] wonderful God tonight. Just before
[6:22] service, Brother Joshua
[6:24] Mukabate sent a praise report and it's
[6:26] kind of lengthy, so I was just going to
[6:28] read it here off the phone. He says,
[6:30] "Last night, Sister Maggie Mapo
[6:32] collapsed at a graduation ceremony. She
[6:35] lost consciousness, couldn't move or
[6:37] speak, but God came on the scene, worked
[6:39] in a miraculous way. Once she collapsed,
[6:43] brothers and sisters surrounded her and
[6:44] instantly started praying. After 10 to
[6:47] 15 minutes, she started attempting to
[6:50] move her hands, which she couldn't do
[6:51] before as she'd been completely
[6:54] unconscious. The ambulance then later
[6:56] rushed her to the hospital, to the
[6:58] emergency room. She was there till about
[7:01] 3 or 4:00 in the morning and finally
[7:03] came home. We give thanks to God for all
[7:06] things, for his mercy and his
[7:07] deliverance. So thankful the Lord was
[7:10] with Sister
[7:13] Maggie. He comes on the scene in our
[7:16] time of need. Amen. So if you have a
[7:18] need tonight, your faith be lifted. May
[7:20] you be encouraged. And the Araos will be
[7:24] traveling to Johnson City, Tennessee for
[7:27] Mary's
[7:28] graduation. Please pray for traveling
[7:30] mercies as they go to Tennessee. So
[7:32] let's remember the Arca Solas. Brother
[7:35] Roger Dunn is scheduled to have spinal
[7:38] surgery tomorrow morning. So, let's pray
[7:39] for Brother Roger. And brother Thomas
[7:42] Yazy sent me a text before service
[7:44] asking that we remember his mother,
[7:46] Effie. She's in the hospital in
[7:49] Flagstaff with complications from a very
[7:51] bad fall. So, let's pray for Brother
[7:53] Thomas's mother, Effie. Pray the Lord
[7:55] just come on the
[7:59] scene. And sister Debbie Sell has an
[8:02] urgent prayer request tonight. She has a
[8:05] skin infection on her leg and she can't
[8:07] be mobile. She sees a doctor in the
[8:09] morning. So let's pray for sister
[8:11] Debbie. Pray the Lord would come on the
[8:12] scene and touch her. And brother Jesse
[8:15] Love, if you would come tonight, just
[8:17] take us before the Lord in prayer. And
[8:19] whatever your need might be, just hold
[8:20] it there before him. Just
[8:22] believe that I believe. Lord, help my
[8:25] unbelief tonight, Lord. Amen. Just also
[8:28] want to pray for brother James. Pray the
[8:30] Lord to just use him this evening as he
[8:32] speaks and just looking forward to what
[8:34] the Lord has in store.
[8:40] Jess, let's bow our
[8:43] heads. Dear Lord Jesus, Father, as we
[8:46] come to you, Lord, this evening,
[8:49] Father, we just ask forgiveness, Lord,
[8:51] for all of our shallow mindness, Lord.
[8:55] Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[8:57] everything you've done for us, Lord. We
[8:59] thank you, Lord, for being with us,
[9:02] Lord, in the storm. We thank you,
[9:04] Father, for being with us in the car,
[9:06] Lord, when we almost have accidents,
[9:08] Lord. Father, we thank you for being
[9:10] with our sister, Lord, when she went
[9:12] down, Lord, and the brothers prayed for
[9:15] her, Lord. We just thank you for raising
[9:17] her up, Lord. Father, just forgive us,
[9:20] Lord, for not seeing you and everything,
[9:23] Lord. Father, we come to you this
[9:26] evening, Lord, and we just ask you to
[9:27] show more of you to us, Father. Lord, be
[9:32] with us, Lord. Be in the song service.
[9:35] We love you, Lord. In Jesus name we
[9:38] pray. Amen. Amen.
[9:42] Amen. You may be seated tonight. Want to
[9:44] welcome each one into the house of the
[9:45] Lord tonight and just look forward to
[9:48] what he has in store for us. Just a
[9:50] reminder, our Sunday school play will be
[9:52] this Sunday, 6 o'clock here at the
[9:54] church. So, all are invited. So, we're
[9:56] looking forward to that. They're
[9:59] remodeling the restrooms over on this
[10:00] side of the church. So, those are closed
[10:03] and off limits tonight. Hopefully,
[10:04] they'll be back be operational on
[10:07] Sunday. And then I've got two notes
[10:10] here. One's from Sister Sarah. She says,
[10:13] "Happy birthday to my sweet husband,
[10:14] Brother Brian." So, Brother Brian, happy
[10:16] birthday. Amen.
[10:19] And then brother Neil and sister Karen
[10:21] also want to wish you a happy birthday.
[10:22] They said they love and appreciate you
[10:24] very much. We all love and appreciate
[10:25] brother Brian. Always happy to see them
[10:28] sitting right there on the front row.
[10:29] And Amen. May the Lord richly bless
[10:31] them. Amen. I am resolved no longer to
[10:35] linger. Charmed by the world's delight.
[10:38] We don't want to linger here. Amen. I
[10:40] want to be ready for that catching away.
[10:42] Amen.
[10:43] I am resolved, no longer to linger,
[10:48] charmed by the world's
[10:52] delight. Things that are higher, things
[10:55] that are nobler, these have alert my
[11:01] sight, and I will hasten to him. Hasten
[11:07] so glad and free.
[11:11] [Music]
[11:12] Jesus the great is highest. I will come
[11:18] to
[11:19] him and I am resolved to go to the
[11:25] savior believing my sin and
[11:29] striving. Oh, he is the true one. He is
[11:33] the just one. He had the words of
[11:38] life and I will hasten to him. Hasten so
[11:45] glad and
[11:47] free. Oh
[11:50] Jesus, the great is highest. I will come
[11:55] to
[11:57] thee and I am resolved to follow the
[12:02] Savior faithful and true each
[12:06] day. Oh, he what he's saying, do what he
[12:11] will and he is the living
[12:16] way and I will hasten to him. hasten so
[12:23] glad and
[12:25] free. Oh
[12:28] Jesus, great is highest. I will come to
[12:34] thee and I am resolved to enter the
[12:39] kingdom. Leaving the paths of
[12:44] sin. And friends may oppose me. Those
[12:48] may be sent me still will I enter in.
[12:54] And I will hasten to him. Hasten so glad
[13:01] and
[13:03] praise.
[13:05] Jesus the greatest highest. I will sing
[13:10] the course
[13:12] again. Oh, I
[13:16] will to him. Hasten so glad and
[13:21] free. Oh
[13:24] Jesus great and highest I will come to
[13:33] thee. Once like a bird in prison I dwelt
[13:38] and no freedom from my sorrow I felt.
[13:43] But then Jesus came and listened to me.
[13:48] Glory to God. He set me free. He set me
[13:54] free. Oh, he set me free. And he broke
[13:59] the bones of prison for me. I'm glory
[14:04] bound by Jesus to sing. Oh, glory to
[14:09] God. He set me free. Now I am climbing
[14:15] higher each day. In darkness of night,
[14:19] it's drifted away and my feet are
[14:23] planted on higher ground. Glory to God.
[14:29] I'm homeward bound. Oh, he set me free.
[14:33] Yes, he set me free and he broke the
[14:37] bonds of prison for me. I'm glory bound
[14:43] by Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. He
[14:48] set me free. Goodbye to sin and things
[14:53] I've been found. Not this world will
[14:58] turn me around. Daily I'm working. I'm
[15:03] praying too. Glory to God. I'm going
[15:09] through. He set me free. Oh, he set me
[15:13] free. And he broke the bones of prison
[15:18] for me. My glory bound my Jesus to sing.
[15:24] Oh, glory to God. He set me
[15:27] [Music]
[15:29] free.
[15:31] Hallelujah. I've been
[15:33] redeemed by love
[15:36] divine. Oh glory,
[15:40] glory. Christ is mine. Oh yes, he's
[15:43] mine. To
[15:45] him I now
[15:48] resign for I have been. I have been.
[15:52] Sing it
[15:53] again. I've been
[15:56] redeemed by love
[15:59] divine. Oh glory,
[16:02] glory. Christ is
[16:05] mine. On the
[16:07] hill I now
[16:10] reside. For I have been. I have been one
[16:15] more time. I've been
[16:18] redeemed by love
[16:21] divine. Oh, glory,
[16:24] glory. Christ is mine. Oh yes, he's
[16:27] mine. All the
[16:29] hell I reside.
[16:33] For I have been I have been
[16:39] redeemed. One night while on life's
[16:44] raging sea, it looked as if I would
[16:48] suffer defeat. As the blackness of
[16:51] light, it closed off the light. My heart
[16:55] sank with
[16:57] fear. My desperate cry, it rang out with
[17:02] fright.
[17:03] All I could see was no hope in sight.
[17:07] With faith all but gone. Oh, I met the
[17:11] one who came looking for
[17:15] me. He came looking for
[17:19] me. He came looking for
[17:24] me. Oh, he made a way when there was no
[17:28] way that I could see.
[17:33] I drifted so far. Jesus was near to
[17:38] rescue my soul, calm all my fear. Now
[17:43] it's safe from all harm. Since I met the
[17:46] one who came looking for
[17:49] [Music]
[17:51] me. Satan had already picked out my
[17:55] grave. His planet moved forward to put
[17:59] me away. I drifted so far. Would anyone
[18:04] care that I'd soon be
[18:08] lost. I knew my destruction was a matter
[18:12] of time. Jesus appeared, said, "This one
[18:16] is mine. Now I'm safe with no harm." He
[18:20] walked through that storm. Came looking
[18:23] for
[18:23] [Music]
[18:25] me. He came looking for me.
[18:30] He came looking for
[18:34] me. Oh, he made a way when there was no
[18:39] way that I could
[18:43] see. I
[18:45] drifted. Jesus was near to rescue my
[18:50] soul from all my fear. Safe from all
[18:54] harm. Since I met the one. Now I'm safe
[18:58] from all
[19:00] harm. Now I'm safe from all harm. Since
[19:04] I met the one who came looking for
[19:08] me. Give him praise to me. Thank you
[19:12] Lord for your mercy and your
[19:14] goodness. Blessed be his holy name.
[19:17] Amen. Sister Anne has a song for us
[19:19] tonight. Sister Anne, thank you for
[19:20] singing for us.
[19:26] you everybody. Um, this is very
[19:28] unplanned. This is not like me. I don't
[19:30] like to sing on the spot, but um, I've
[19:32] had this song for a while in my heart
[19:34] and and tonight we I was not even
[19:36] supposed to play the piano or whatever,
[19:38] but um, I just felt I had to sing a
[19:40] song. It's an old hymn. Maybe some of
[19:42] you know it. Just sing along with me.
[19:45] Um, and I was just reading about the I
[19:47] was just curious. I was like, "Oh,
[19:48] that's a hymn." Like, let's see what
[19:50] what's behind the song or who wrote it.
[19:52] And I was just reading it's um the lady
[19:55] that wrote it, the sister that wrote it.
[19:57] Um she was orphaned twice like she lost
[20:00] two time her parents and her adoptive
[20:02] parents. She had multiple sclerosis. She
[20:05] was in a wheelchair and you just if you
[20:08] put yourself in her like this is what
[20:11] the song is about. So I hope it can be a
[20:13] blessing. It's very unprepared. We like
[20:15] we haven't really run into it but God
[20:18] bless you.
[20:22] [Music]
[20:32] He
[20:35] giveth more
[20:37] grace as our
[20:40] burden grow.
[20:42] [Music]
[20:44] He sendeth more
[20:48] grace as our
[20:51] labors
[20:54] increase to
[20:56] added
[20:59] affliction. He
[21:02] added his
[21:05] mercy to
[21:08] multiplay trials.
[21:11] be
[21:18] multiply when we have
[21:23] exhausted our store of
[21:28] endurance. When our strength has
[21:33] fell air, the day is half
[21:38] dawn. When we reach the end of
[21:44] our
[21:46] hoarded
[21:48] resources, our
[21:51] father
[21:53] forgiven is
[21:56] only begun.
[21:59] His love has no
[22:03] limit. His grace has no
[22:08] measure. His power, no
[22:14] boundary known unto men.
[22:22] For out
[22:23] of his
[22:27] infinite riches in
[22:31] Jesus, he give
[22:33] it and
[22:36] giveth and
[22:38] giveth again.
[22:45] Fear not that thy
[22:48] need shall exceed
[22:51] his
[22:53] provision or God ever
[22:58] yours. His resource to
[23:03] share in the heart of thee are
[23:08] never
[23:10] lasting a
[23:13] failing the
[23:15] father both thee and
[23:18] thy love will
[23:22] appear. His love has no
[23:27] limits. His grace has no
[23:32] measure. His power no
[23:37] bounty
[23:39] known unto
[23:41] [Music]
[23:44] men. Pour out
[23:46] of his
[23:50] infinite riches in
[23:55] Jesus. He
[23:58] giveth and he
[24:00] giveth. He give it again.
[24:07] [Music]
[24:20] me
[24:22] in su.
[24:25] [Music]
[24:45] He done pleased the
[24:50] cross. He
[24:53] giveth and
[24:56] giveth him
[24:59] giveth again.
[25:03] [Music]
[25:09] Amen. Beautiful old song. Thank you,
[25:12] Sister Anne. Let's all stand as we
[25:14] prepare to turn the service. Brother
[25:15] James, pour your spirit out on me. Amen.
[25:18] Invite him to rain down upon us tonight.
[25:21] How many are looking forward to what the
[25:22] Lord has for you tonight?
[25:25] Amen. Pour your spirit out on me.
[25:32] Fall just like the
[25:33] [Music]
[25:35] rain.
[25:38] Saturate my thirsty
[25:41] soul. Come and fall aresh on
[25:46] me. Fill my cup
[25:51] again. Heal my heart and make me whole.
[25:59] I need you
[26:02] now for your once again as we invite him
[26:06] to have his
[26:07] way. Pour your spirit out on
[26:12] me. Fall just like the
[26:17] rain.
[26:19] Saturate my thirsty.

[26:27] me. Fill my cup
[26:32] again. Fill my heart and make me
[26:39] whole. I need you
[26:43] now for your spirit.
[26:50] Is that truly your desire this evening?
[26:53] that he would come and he would pour
[26:55] himself out once again that he would
[26:57] renew us aresh.
[27:02] There's a portion in
[27:03] [Music]
[27:08] scripture that they begin to walk away
[27:10] from
[27:11] [Music]
[27:12] Jesus and he asked his disciples, "Will
[27:15] you go also?"
[27:17] [Music]
[27:18] Peter told him, "Lord, where would we
[27:21] go? Amen. Where would we go, saints?
[27:26] Where would we go?
[27:29] For you have the words of eternal life.
[27:33] How thankful we are. How blessed we are.
[27:36] That God sent a prophet in this day to
[27:39] come, a vindicated word that we can
[27:42] follow. Amen.
[27:44] Don't take it for granted. Don't take it
[27:46] for Don't take it
[27:49] lightly.
[27:51] Could we sing the song only believe?
[27:58] [Music]
[27:59] He said, "If I can get the people to
[28:01] believe,
[28:04] God, you don't got to understand it all,
[28:07] [Music]
[28:09] but just believe."
[28:11] [Music]
[28:15] Let's sing this together.
[28:19] Yes.
[28:21] Holy believe.
[28:24] [Music]
[28:31] Believe all things are
[28:38] possible.
[28:41] Only believe.
[28:43] [Music]
[28:46] Oh, we believe.
[28:53] Oh, we
[28:57] believe all things are
[29:04] possible.
[29:07] Only believe.
[29:10] Let's just bow our heads and our hearts
[29:12] together.
[29:14] Maybe you have a need upon your heart.
[29:17] My boys are home. It's sick this
[29:19] evening.
[29:20] And I know Ben's little boy is got strep
[29:24] throat and little Jethro's got an ear
[29:27] infection. And I'm sure there's many
[29:29] needs across this building.
[29:32] But only believe that all things are
[29:35] possible.
[29:38] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we've gathered
[29:40] on this Wednesday
[29:42] night, Lord, we set aside the cares of
[29:45] life. We set aside the the workday. And
[29:48] I know your people have come. Maybe
[29:50] they've worked hard and they're tired
[29:51] and body, but Lord, they've made a
[29:53] sacrifice to come and hear your word.
[29:55] And we're just asking by the foolishness
[29:58] of preaching that you would come by and
[29:59] that you would minister to hearts. That
[30:01] you would, Lord, come and just talk to
[30:03] us along the way. Father, Lord, there's
[30:06] a there's a world that's dying out
[30:08] there, but you've sent a word. You've
[30:10] sent a light in this day. And how
[30:12] blessed we are that we can come with an
[30:14] opportunity, Lord, not taking it
[30:16] lightly, not taking it for granted,
[30:19] Lord, but would you come and just speak
[30:21] to our
[30:22] hearts, Lord, how we love you and we
[30:24] thank you for your goodness and your
[30:26] mercy in our lives. What a blessed
[30:28] people we are. Yes. We just ask that you
[30:31] would come. Give us eye sab to see. Give
[30:34] us uncction of the Holy Spirit. Lord,
[30:37] soften the grounds of our hearts. Lord,
[30:39] let us receive what you would have for
[30:40] us this evening. We grant it. And we'll
[30:44] be sure to give you all the praise, the
[30:45] honor, and the glory in Jesus name.
[30:49] Amen. And amen. You love the Lord this
[30:52] evening. Amen. If you have your
[30:55] Bibles, thank you musicians.
[31:01] St. John
[31:03] 14. St. John 14. And then we're going to
[31:05] turn to Malachi
[31:10] 4. Just for a a simple thought this
[31:13] evening, it's going to be changing times
[31:15] but an unchangeable God.
[31:21] St. John 14 and verse
[31:25] 12 it says verily verily I say unto you
[31:28] he that believeth on me the works that I
[31:31] do shall he do also and the greater
[31:32] works than these shall he do because I
[31:34] go unto my father and whatsoever ye
[31:37] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[31:39] the father may be glorified in the son
[31:43] and if you ask anything in my name I
[31:46] will do it thank you lord and he
[31:49] continues here in this portion if If you
[31:51] love me, keep my commandments.
[31:55] And it just struck me and I know that
[31:57] there's no coincidence on how God writes
[31:59] his scriptures.
[32:01] There's a purpose and a place in how he
[32:03] writes these things. And he unfolds it.
[32:05] And he says, "If you want to do the
[32:07] greater work, if you want to do the
[32:09] greater things, ask anything in my
[32:11] name." But he says, "If you love me,
[32:14] keep my word." Amen. Keep my
[32:16] commandments.
[32:17] In verse 16, "And I will pray the father
[32:19] and he shall give you another comforter
[32:22] that he may abide with you forever." I'm
[32:26] so thankful it's forever. That it's not
[32:29] just a a a part-time or a sometime or
[32:32] whenever he feels like it. And you know,
[32:34] sometimes in the bad times, no, this
[32:36] comforter abides with us forever. Amen.
[32:41] Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[32:43] cannot receive, because it seeth him
[32:45] not, neither knoweth him, but ye know
[32:48] him, for he dwelleth in you, and shall
[32:50] be with you. I will not leave you
[32:53] comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a
[32:55] little while, and the world will see me
[32:57] no more, but ye shall see me. Because I
[32:59] live, ye shall live also. And at that
[33:02] day shall ye know that I am in the
[33:04] Father, and ye in me, and I in you. Yes,
[33:07] sir. He that hath my commandments and
[33:10] keepeth them. So, it's not just having
[33:12] the commandments. It's not just having
[33:15] your name in a church age book. It's not
[33:17] just having your name and having the
[33:19] books of the prophets and all these uh
[33:21] you know your Bible and table on your
[33:24] phone. All these things. It's not just
[33:26] having the commandments, but it's
[33:28] keeping them. Amen.
[33:33] And keepeth him. He it is that loveth
[33:36] me. And he that loveth me, he shall be
[33:38] loved of my father, and I will love him,
[33:41] and will manifest myself to him. Thank
[33:43] you, Lord. Let's turn to Malachi 4 and
[33:46] verse
[33:51] one. We know this was spoken
[33:54] prophetically and it was given for a
[33:56] future time.
[34:00] In Malachi 4:1 it says, "For behold, the
[34:03] day cometh that shall burn as an oven,
[34:06] and all the proud, yay, and all that do
[34:08] wickedly shall be stubble. And the day
[34:11] that that cometh shall burn up them up,
[34:14] sayeth the Lord of hosts, that it shall
[34:16] leave thee neither root nor branch. But
[34:19] unto you that fear my name shall the son
[34:23] of righteousness arise with healing in
[34:25] his wings. And ye shall go forth and
[34:28] grow up as calves of the stall. And ye
[34:31] shall tread down the wicked, and they
[34:33] shall be ashes under the souls of your
[34:35] feet in the day that I shall do this,
[34:38] sayeth the Lord of hosts. Amen. In verse
[34:41] four, remember ye the laws of Moses my
[34:44] servant, which I have commanded unto him
[34:46] in Orab for all of Israel, which is my
[34:50] statutes and my judgments. You can be
[34:53] seated this
[34:56] evening. Thank you, sir.
[35:00] So now looking at these portions of
[35:02] scripture and the ones I highlighted
[35:04] here is he that hath my commandments and
[35:07] keepeth
[35:09] them. He it is that loveth me and he
[35:11] that loveth me shall ab shall be loved
[35:14] of my father and I will love him and I
[35:17] will manifest myself in him. And I begin
[35:19] to look in Malachi 4 here. We know that
[35:22] Malachi 4:5 was speaking of the prophet
[35:25] of this day. And we know that this
[35:27] scripture is is is fulfilled. And and we
[35:30] know that the that when scripture is
[35:32] written, as I said, it is written in
[35:34] certain ways. And as I begin to read
[35:37] here in Malachi 4, and it says, "But
[35:38] unto you that fear my name shall a son
[35:41] of
[35:42] righteousness arise with healing in his
[35:45] wings." So there's coming a day, listen
[35:47] to everybody else, there's darkness and
[35:49] there's going to be doom and and
[35:51] destruction. But unto you, unto you that
[35:53] fear my name shall the son of
[35:56] righteousness. The prophet would say
[35:58] shalom. Good morning. What is it? It is
[36:00] the rising of the sun.
[36:03] And so we see the son of righteousness
[36:06] shall come with healing in his wings and
[36:08] he shall tread down the wicked and they
[36:10] shall be as ashes under your feet. And
[36:12] you can read the scripture whose feet
[36:14] shall the shall tread upon them. It is
[36:18] going to be your feet that you tread
[36:19] upon the wicked ones, the ones that have
[36:21] tried to come upon you. And as I read
[36:23] this scripture, we know that in verse
[36:26] five, it says, "Behold, I send Elijah
[36:28] the prophet."
[36:30] So why did he have to put this verse
[36:33] four, remember ye the laws and the
[36:36] statutes that I have given unto Abraham.
[36:39] And so I begin to look here and if we
[36:42] continue in St. John
[36:44] 14, Judas saith unto him not as scary he
[36:47] says Lord how is it that will manifest
[36:50] thyself unto us and not unto the world.
[36:55] You see to a human mind and trying to
[36:57] understand certain things it is so uh it
[37:02] is said in such a way that we we
[37:03] question how God how are you going to
[37:05] come and show yourself and the world
[37:07] won't recognize. But let me ask you that
[37:10] what is happening in this our day. The
[37:12] things and prophecies are coming to pass
[37:14] and yet they are not recognizing what is
[37:17] happening.
[37:21] Christ showing himself in simplicity.
[37:23] He's showing himself to an elect lady in
[37:26] our day and the whole world has no idea
[37:28] what is happening. Right.
[37:31] And he that loveth
[37:32] me not keepeth not my sayings, and the
[37:35] words which he have heard not, but my
[37:37] father which sent me. These things have
[37:39] I spoken unto you, being present with
[37:41] you. But the comforter, which is the
[37:44] Holy Ghost, listen, this is why it's so
[37:46] important to get the Holy Ghost.
[37:50] But the comforter, which is the Holy
[37:51] Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
[37:53] name, he will teach you all things and
[37:56] bring all things to your remembrance.
[37:58] whatsoever I say unto you. You say,
[38:01] "Brother James, I don't know everything
[38:03] and I read in my scriptures and I have
[38:05] certain questions." Well, you get the
[38:06] Holy Ghost one time and let me tell you,
[38:08] he will begin to teach you and he will
[38:10] begin to reveal unto you and he'll begin
[38:13] to manifest himself unto you all these
[38:16] things. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[38:20] It's so important to get the Holy Ghost.
[38:23] Yes, sir. Because he teaches us these
[38:25] things. And how can the Holy Ghost bring
[38:27] us these things back into our
[38:29] remembrance? Brother Brandham would
[38:31] begin to tell us. He's like, "I'm a
[38:33] proud American and everything that
[38:34] America was, I am." He says, "I was
[38:37] there at Plymouth Rock. I was there when
[38:39] they wrote the Declaration of
[38:40] Independence. I was there." Why? Because
[38:42] I was an American. But let me say this
[38:45] evening, he also said that I because I
[38:47] was a Christian. I was there when all
[38:50] those things happened in the Bible. I
[38:52] was there at Calvary when they crucified
[38:54] him. But I was there three days later
[38:56] when they rose again. Everything that
[38:59] happened throughout the Bible, why is it
[39:01] bringing it into your remembrance? It
[39:03] was because you were there. Amen. It's
[39:05] the same Holy Ghost for each one of us.
[39:08] He begins to reveal and he begins to
[39:10] show us and teach us all things. Yes,
[39:12] sir. He is the great comforter.
[39:17] And he says, "Peace I leave unto you. My
[39:20] peace I give unto you. Not as the world
[39:23] giveth give I unto you. Let not your
[39:26] heart be troubled neither let it be
[39:29] afraid. Amen. Why is it whenever this
[39:32] whole world is falling apart
[39:34] and people are running to and fro have
[39:37] no answers and yet they see your life
[39:40] and I have, you know, men that I talk
[39:43] with and we and we go and we'll go out
[39:46] to lunch and he'll begin to see and
[39:47] he'll be like, "Well, how's business
[39:49] going and how's this and that?" And you
[39:51] begin to talk about certain things and
[39:53] yet there's no fear. There's no worry.
[39:56] Why? Because this is all carnal. This is
[39:58] all temporal.
[40:00] This has no meaning. No matter how busy
[40:02] I get and how crazy life is, this is the
[40:05] the number one thing.
[40:08] This is the number one priority that we
[40:10] must keep in line that we must keep our
[40:12] life lined up with this word.
[40:15] Because if we begin to drown ourselves
[40:18] in in work and in in life and the
[40:20] busyiness and the cares of life as the
[40:22] scripture would say, we become just like
[40:25] them. True. But how blessed we are that
[40:28] we have a sanctuary to come to that we
[40:30] have a God that it's not just some God
[40:32] way up up there but he's a personal God.
[40:36] Yes he is. Peace I leave with you. And
[40:39] he says uh in in chapter or in verse 19
[40:42] he says now I have told you before it
[40:44] should come to pass that when it has
[40:47] come to pass you might believe.
[40:50] When it comes to pass you'll believe.
[40:53] Then right many times that's what even
[40:56] the prophets all down through the the
[40:58] ages they would begin to prophesy you
[41:00] can brother Brandon would tell us many
[41:02] times in the scripture or you know in
[41:04] his sermons he would say write this down
[41:06] write this in the fly leaf in your
[41:08] Bibles see if it thus sayeth the Lord
[41:10] and it don't come to pass if it don't
[41:12] come to pass I'm a false prophet but he
[41:14] says write these things down mark these
[41:16] things in your mind he would say
[41:19] why it's just thus sayeth the Lord it's
[41:21] the same spirit speaking Amen. Yes, sir.
[41:24] That when these things come to pass, you
[41:27] will believe then.
[41:29] And we know that in Amos, he would say
[41:33] that it's got to come to his prophets
[41:35] first. And as we journey down through
[41:37] the Bible, God would use prophets that
[41:40] he would lead his people. They would
[41:41] never have a king or or somebody a ruler
[41:44] over them, but God would anoint a man, a
[41:46] God- called man, that he would give them
[41:48] a word for that day. and he would lead
[41:50] his people according to his the the
[41:53] leadership of almighty God. Amen.
[41:56] And God doesn't ever change the way that
[41:59] he operates. He always operates the same
[42:01] way. So as he started and he would have
[42:03] Moses lead the people out of Israel and
[42:05] you see or out of Egypt and you would
[42:07] see all these the leadership of man. But
[42:09] what happens with man is they get puffed
[42:11] up or they get in a way that they can do
[42:13] it themselves and they begin to say,
[42:15] "Well, we don't need God. Let's just
[42:17] let's anoint a man within ourselves.
[42:19] Let's raise up a man. And that's what
[42:21] they did. And if we look at it in the
[42:23] Old Testament in Samuel in 1 Samuel uh
[42:26] uh verse one or chapter 1 and we we
[42:30] would see here that Hannah w would go
[42:32] into the priest of Eli and she would cry
[42:35] out unto God and she would say, "Lord, I
[42:37] I would want a son." And God would she
[42:39] would vow a vow and God would honor her
[42:41] faith and he would give her a son. It
[42:43] would be Samuel. and verse three and
[42:45] chapter 3 would go on and there would be
[42:47] no open vision in that day. There was no
[42:49] prophet to lead the people. So what
[42:52] happened is God began to raise up this
[42:53] young man Samuel under the the
[42:56] leadership of Eli. And and we know the
[42:58] story that you know God would call unto
[43:01] Samuel and he'd say Samuel, Samuel. And
[43:04] Samuel would run unto Eli and say I'm
[43:06] here. And after a while, why? Because he
[43:09] didn't know the leadership of God. The
[43:11] scripture says he didn't know God at
[43:13] that time. And so then when Eli caught
[43:16] on, he says, "No, call unto it is God
[43:19] that's calling you." So what happens is
[43:21] God is leading this man, he's raising up
[43:23] a young man. And we know the story that
[43:26] in chapter 8 and let's read in verse
[43:29] one. And it came to pass when Samuel was
[43:31] old. So we know that uh as as scripture
[43:34] would have it, we would see that the
[43:37] people of Israel for a time. But
[43:39] whenever he got old that he made his
[43:41] sons judge judges over Israel. And now
[43:44] the name of his firstborn was Joel and
[43:46] the name of his second was
[43:49] Abaya. And they were judges in
[43:53] Basheba. And his sons walked not in the
[43:56] ways, not in his ways, but turned aside
[44:01] after Lucer and took bribes and
[44:03] perverted judgment. They began to
[44:05] disobey and walk away from the
[44:07] commandments of God.
[44:09] They begin to do things, but yet Samuel
[44:11] appointed them. You see, sometimes you
[44:14] got to be careful because sons that are
[44:16] appointed, you you see God can call a
[44:18] man and he can call a man to be a
[44:20] pastor. And you can see it happen within
[44:22] the message that they'll he'll he'll
[44:24] call a man to be a pastor, but doesn't
[44:26] mean that his son is a pastor as well.
[44:29] But then you get this successionary
[44:32] ministry that's coming that, oh, when
[44:34] this pastor pass away, well, my son's
[44:35] going to take over or this person's
[44:37] going to take over. That's not the way
[44:38] that God elects man. That's not the way
[44:40] God calls man.
[44:44] Right?
[44:47] You see, it's easy sometimes to see or
[44:50] try to to to put that into our our
[44:53] carnal reasoning that he maybe he's
[44:55] around the ministry or we raised up in a
[44:57] church so he knows the ways and he I can
[45:00] put more confidence you know I'm going
[45:01] to put you in position. But yet you see
[45:04] his sons did evil in the sight of God.
[45:07] Yeah.
[45:10] And then all the elders of Israel
[45:13] gathered themselves together and came to
[45:16] Samuel unto Rama and said unto him,
[45:18] "Behold, thou are old, and thy sons walk
[45:20] not in thy ways. Now make us a king to
[45:24] judge us like all the
[45:26] nations. Make us a king. Give us a
[45:29] king." And the Lord said unto Samuel,
[45:32] hearken unto their voice of the people
[45:34] in all that they say unto thee, and they
[45:37] have not rejected thee, but they have
[45:39] reject they haven't rejected thee, but
[45:41] they've rejected me that I should not
[45:43] reign over them.
[45:46] They haven't rejected you, Samuel, but
[45:48] they've rejected me under my leadership.
[45:51] They want a man. They want somebody that
[45:53] they would go into battle and they would
[45:55] lead them and they can worship him.
[45:58] And what did God do? He honored their
[46:01] wish. He says, "You want a king? I'll
[46:03] give you a king. But you let me tell you
[46:05] what this king's going to do. Let me
[46:07] tell you how he's going to lead your
[46:09] people. You let me tell you the laws
[46:10] that you're going to have to live by and
[46:12] the tenth of this and that and all the
[46:14] offerings that you're going to have to
[46:15] take and give up and your sons are going
[46:17] to have to go into battle and your
[46:18] daughters are going to become cooks and
[46:20] servants and ma handmaids and all these
[46:22] things." And guess what? They still
[46:24] wanted a king. Yeah. Give us a king.
[46:28] Give us a king.
[46:34] And you can track these two spirits
[46:36] down all the way back. Brother Brandham
[46:38] says you can track it all the way back
[46:40] down to the garden where Cain and Abel
[46:42] would
[46:43] grow. And Judas and Christ, brother
[46:47] Brandham says in the mark of the beast,
[46:49] he would say that Calvary, he says we
[46:51] can see that there was three crosses at
[46:53] Calvary.
[46:55] There was three crosses at Calvary, but
[46:58] yet there was a fourth off in the
[46:59] distance because Judas hung himself in
[47:01] shame. He was out there. He says, "How
[47:04] beautiful the type." He says, "You can
[47:05] follow it right through Calvary." That
[47:07] Jesus, the son of man, came down and he
[47:09] was manifest. He came to get the
[47:11] repented sinner and take him back to
[47:13] heaven. And yet he had the unrepentant
[47:15] sinner and the son of predition that
[47:17] came from hell and he took him back to
[47:19] hell. He says, you see him intertwined
[47:22] all the way down through history.
[47:27] the antichrist and the bride coming into
[47:29] manifestation in this day.
[47:32] You see, religion is according to it the
[47:34] leadership of man and what they say and
[47:36] how they want the word of God to go.
[47:39] Religion is one of those things that
[47:41] they can lead a group of people and it's
[47:43] amazing what people will follow. It's
[47:45] amazing what people will get under that
[47:47] influence that a man under a certain
[47:49] anointing can anoint people to believe
[47:52] in what he says.
[47:56] And brother Brandham says, "I I don't
[47:58] hate the people. I hate the the the the
[48:00] religion and the things that they stand
[48:02] for." Amen. The spirits behind those.
[48:07] And yet they can get so anointed to
[48:09] believe. And what happens in religion?
[48:11] Man begins to put his own opinion. He
[48:13] begins to put his own ideas. He begins
[48:15] to put things. He begins to put a dot
[48:17] instead of a comma. And how they believe
[48:20] and what they and things that they
[48:22] should do. You can look at it from the
[48:24] Catholic Church. The pope before Pope
[48:26] Francis came in and what did he begin to
[48:28] do? He begin to uh change up laws and
[48:31] rules and things within and how they
[48:33] operate. He would begin to he he started
[48:36] a process in trying to allow women to
[48:38] become deacons and stuff within the
[48:40] church.
[48:42] You take one of the oldest religions
[48:45] in history, right? And yet you can take
[48:48] one man, he comes into office and he can
[48:50] begin to change laws and do things and
[48:54] change things. What was the big thing he
[48:56] was known for is to in include all the
[48:59] inclusivity
[49:01] of the LGBQ and all the gays and all
[49:03] these different things.
[49:06] He began to change. How do you change
[49:07] God's word?
[49:10] How do you change something a a religion
[49:13] of history and all all these years? Can
[49:16] you imagine all those popes that have
[49:18] gone before him? I wonder what they
[49:21] would say to the things that he passed.
[49:25] And I had watched this little interview
[49:27] on on on and just how what the reasoning
[49:29] behind and why he would change. And he
[49:32] would begin, he says, "Who am I to
[49:34] judge?
[49:36] Who am I to judge?"
[49:38] He says, "God loves everybody." He says,
[49:41] "Whenever they come and they want me to
[49:43] bless their gay marriage," you know what
[49:44] it is? He said, he says, "I don't bless
[49:46] their gay marriage because that's
[49:47] against God's laws and statutes." He
[49:49] says, "I bless them as
[49:51] individuals." Now, how does that make
[49:54] sense? You bless the individual, but you
[49:56] don't bless their mar. Like, how does
[49:58] that
[50:00] because you don't want to offend. You
[50:01] don't want to hurt somebody.
[50:05] But yet, you also don't want to stand on
[50:06] God's word and tell them no, that this
[50:08] is wrong.
[50:17] Who am I to judge? He
[50:20] said, "How do you bless a
[50:23] couple?" So what is it? You bless the
[50:25] individual, but you allow them to
[50:27] continue to live in
[50:29] sin. You see, the reasoning behind it
[50:32] doesn't make sense. But yet it's the
[50:34] world and the day and the hour that
[50:36] we're living in that as long as you give
[50:38] them money and as long as you pour give
[50:40] them a dollar and as long as you pay and
[50:43] you go and you go and do these masses
[50:44] and everything, they accept and they
[50:46] want
[50:48] everybody. Let me tell you, they ain't
[50:50] after your soul. They're after your
[50:51] money. That's right. And you say, "Well,
[50:53] how do you know?
[50:56] My mom was raised up Catholic and she
[50:59] would tell me that even her
[51:02] uncle, they didn't have, they were poor
[51:04] and they didn't have enough money to get
[51:06] a casket. They didn't have enough money
[51:08] to pay a priest to come and do the
[51:10] ceremony. So, they put a bed sheet over
[51:13] a a fold up table and that's how he had
[51:15] his funeral. Because if you want to be
[51:18] buried, if you want to have a priest
[51:20] come and do your wedding, if you want to
[51:21] have a priest do your dedications, if
[51:23] you want to have a priest come and do
[51:24] your your uh your funeral, you got to
[51:27] pay the money.
[51:33] How would you like it if brother Ron
[51:34] started doing that?
[51:37] How would you feel that you paid and you
[51:40] did your whole life and you served you
[51:42] served the church and you gave your
[51:44] money and you did
[51:45] everything? And he says, "Okay, now you
[51:47] got to pay me. You want me to come pray
[51:49] for you? I'll pay. Pay. You want me to
[51:52] come to your house? You want me to come
[51:53] to the hospital?
[51:55] Pay. I'll come. I'll serve you."
[52:04] The mother ever the brand would
[52:06] call it after your money.
[52:10] And yet you see that even her other
[52:13] uncle just passed away a couple years
[52:14] ago. We would go and he was live down in
[52:17] Tucson and we'd go and pray with him
[52:18] just before I mean just a shell of a
[52:21] man. My dad would go and see him one of
[52:24] the last times. He didn't want a
[52:26] Catholic priest. He didn't want somebody
[52:28] to come and do his sermon. You know who
[52:29] he wanted?
[52:31] My dad.
[52:34] Why? because he's seen the life of
[52:36] Christ in him. He's seen the life of
[52:39] Christ in him. He says that's a man of
[52:41] God. That's right. That he would come
[52:43] and that he would pray for me and he
[52:45] would come and he would have feelings
[52:46] and you can feel the difference. They
[52:49] know when it's real. They know when it's
[52:51] genuine. They know when it's not a put
[52:53] on. It's not a religion. Let me tell
[52:54] you, this is not a religion. This isn't
[52:57] something that I put on and I do it and
[52:59] I do this and I do it for money and all
[53:01] that. No, no, no. This isn't for that.
[53:03] This is a relationship with Jesus
[53:05] Christ. It's a relationship with not
[53:07] only him, but with his people and a love
[53:09] for his people to serve God's people.
[53:12] Amen. Yes, sir. Amen.
[53:23] We know the prophecy and I and I know
[53:26] Brother Ron hit it on Sunday. I I didn't
[53:28] get to stream it. The streaming shut
[53:29] down. So if I say something repetitive,
[53:32] you just say amen like you heard it the
[53:34] first time. Amen.
[53:36] But I just want to say this because
[53:38] before I say put this next
[53:40] portion is because I had many questions
[53:43] here or not many questions but you see
[53:45] when the prophecy is being fulfilled and
[53:47] things are being said and prophetic
[53:49] things are said and you look at it and
[53:51] you find it in brother Brandham's
[53:53] ministry, I have to tie it all the way
[53:55] through. This is me as an individual.
[53:58] You have to see that whenever he speaks
[54:00] something that if he says it a certain
[54:02] way, you got to make sure that it lines
[54:04] up all together.
[54:06] That it's just not when he says, "Thus
[54:07] sayeth the Lord," it's not just a happen
[54:09] stance and it goes here and it and it
[54:11] comes back and it might be this and it
[54:13] might be that. But no, it's all the way
[54:16] through. Amen. Because I had many
[54:17] questions even within a young man I was
[54:21] talking with. But brother Brandham says,
[54:23] "Uh, watch the purple curtain." He says,
[54:25] "Listen, thus sayeth the Lord, repent. I
[54:27] predict the three curtains we know. He
[54:28] says, "Remember in the name of the Lord
[54:30] Jesus, get away from it." He says, "Come
[54:33] away from anything that is attached to
[54:35] it." And I skipped over, but watch the
[54:38] purple curtain that's arising in the
[54:39] United States.
[54:43] The Roman Empire, the crulest of them
[54:45] all. Now listen, the conclave didn't
[54:46] have any choice on it.
[54:49] They think they had a choice. But when
[54:51] God's word is being fulfilled, things
[54:54] are coming to pass. They can make all
[54:56] the decision. They they made the
[54:58] decision. But let me tell you, when
[55:00] God's timing is to come to pass, it's
[55:02] his time. It don't matter how many popes
[55:04] and this and that and religions and you
[55:06] can vote on this and that. No. When
[55:08] God's word is going to come to pass,
[55:10] it's going to come to pass. Yes, sir.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:15] And so we see that the Catholic religion
[55:18] and even before the news would hit and
[55:21] everything would come out, I begin to
[55:23] look on it because as seasons and we're
[55:25] talking on uh changing times, but an
[55:28] unchanging God. And as changing times
[55:30] begin to happen, you begin to see bigger
[55:32] ponds being put in place. When
[55:34] presidents ta change or this happens or
[55:37] a pope is changing, you better look and
[55:40] watch and see what's happening. Amen.
[55:42] Sure. That drawing. So, as you know,
[55:45] Pope Francis would pass away over the
[55:47] past month or whatever it is, you just
[55:49] begin to watch and see how is it going
[55:52] to play out.
[55:55] And the news would say it would be
[55:57] impossible for American Pope. And we I'm
[56:00] sure you guys seen it all. And how that
[56:01] they would push for a black or an Asian
[56:03] or, you know, there was different
[56:05] things. And who knows, we could have had
[56:06] the first woman pope for all we know.
[56:10] You laugh, but you better watch out
[56:15] because there's things coming and
[56:16] happening.
[56:20] And so what made me get to think on this
[56:22] as we even went to Branson and we seen
[56:24] the play
[56:26] and there was something of whenever they
[56:29] began to shout, "Give us a king. Give us
[56:32] a king." And I begin to seen clips of
[56:34] whenever the pope was elected and it was
[56:36] an American pope and you see all the
[56:39] people going crazy
[56:41] and the antichrist spirit and you could
[56:43] see two sides. What are they wanting?
[56:47] Give us a king. Give us a ruler. Give us
[56:48] somebody over us.
[56:51] These spirits that are rising
[56:54] and we know that
[56:56] prophecy of a woman coming in power.
[56:59] Now, brother Brandham says the first
[57:01] time that he mentioned it was 1955 of a
[57:04] woman coming into power. Now, this is
[57:06] the question that I had because we know
[57:08] that before brother Brandham says before
[57:10] the end time would come, there'd be a
[57:11] woman that would be a great ruler in the
[57:13] nation and she will either be a
[57:15] president or something in that order, a
[57:17] great
[57:18] woman. So, up until 1958, he would or 55
[57:22] from 1955 to 1958, he would begin to say
[57:25] that he was a woman of some sort. I
[57:27] can't tell. But he never really mentions
[57:28] it would be the Catholic
[57:30] Church. And so we know that Camala would
[57:34] come into to office and so people would
[57:37] say this is prophecy. He said a woman
[57:39] would come into power. Now I believe it
[57:43] but there was something behind and there
[57:45] was a time in the last year that I would
[57:48] begin to uh study it out and I would try
[57:50] to uh put it into something and it just
[57:53] would fall flat. Brother Matthew would
[57:55] know that we were working together and
[57:56] we had this question. Why? Because in
[57:58] 1963 he says and this is what be a woman
[58:02] stand up there that would govern the
[58:03] United States. Not actually a woman but
[58:06] a church. And then I seen her with
[58:08] nothing but ashes is going going to
[58:11] happen.
[58:12] So I said how could it be a woman but
[58:14] then he says it's a church. So if you
[58:17] begin to look at all the times that the
[58:19] prophet would begin to say this from
[58:21] 1955 to 1958 he would say I believe it's
[58:23] a woman or something. Five or six times
[58:26] he would say it.
[58:29] But then if you begin to follow from
[58:31] 1958
[58:34] on this is this the the the
[58:38] quote he says there will be a great and
[58:40] powerful woman rise up either a woman
[58:42] president or a dictator or some great
[58:44] woman in the United States and she'll
[58:46] sink under the influence of women. Now
[58:50] you remember thus sayaith the Lord and
[58:52] she's
[58:53] wrong. What has given way to it? Let me
[58:56] tell you be spiritual. Let open up.
[58:58] Look, he says, why is it doing that? To
[59:01] give the
[59:02] way to give the Catholic Church a place
[59:05] to come in. Amen. To give the Catholic
[59:09] Church a place to come in. And from
[59:11] 1958, from that very quote, he begins to
[59:14] say that it's the Catholic Church. He
[59:16] begins to say it's a woman in power. He
[59:17] begins to say that it's a woman or
[59:19] something like that. He says per uh
[59:21] perhaps a woman being beautiful and
[59:23] attractive. Now, beauty is within the
[59:27] eyes of a holder. Amen. So, when Camala
[59:31] came into office, it's hard to
[59:36] uh but you see that he says perhaps a
[59:40] woman beautiful and attractive will be
[59:42] the Catholic Church, cruel at heart, and
[59:45] she'll lead the nation to pollution.
[59:51] He says, "But a powerful woman." And now
[59:53] remember this isn't you see in church.
[59:55] He says this is on tape. He says a
[59:57] beautiful w a powerful woman, a great
[59:59] woman. She'll either be a president or
[1:00:01] she'll be a woman representing the
[1:00:03] Catholic church which I think it is
[1:00:06] which will take over someday and she
[1:00:08] will rule this country. This nation is a
[1:00:10] woman's nation. He says everything is
[1:00:13] woman woman. Write down he says and just
[1:00:16] the bait for the Catholic church for the
[1:00:18] worship of a woman. They're already
[1:00:21] worshiping a woman. Anyhow,
[1:00:24] you see, he made a way by a woman
[1:00:26] president. Then he would say he would
[1:00:28] open the door for the Catholic Church to
[1:00:29] come in. Many would say even the news
[1:00:32] articles, they always wanted they never
[1:00:34] wanted America to have a pope. Why?
[1:00:36] Because they would have the religion
[1:00:38] power. Not only all the other powers,
[1:00:40] economical and all that, but it would be
[1:00:42] they would have the religious power.
[1:00:43] Right. Now they're saying, "Well, the
[1:00:46] reason they have American Pope is
[1:00:47] because they wouldn't have they don't
[1:00:49] have the power." But that's not right.
[1:00:52] Yeah. Until she's defeated, until she's
[1:00:55] sent down.
[1:00:59] So, we look at our lives and we see that
[1:01:02] prophecy is coming into fulfillment,
[1:01:05] that changes are happening, things are
[1:01:06] happening. Listen, now's not a time to
[1:01:09] get your line all tangled up. Now's not
[1:01:10] a time to start getting distracted.
[1:01:13] Amen. You say, "What are you trying to
[1:01:15] tell us this evening? That things are
[1:01:16] changing. Things are happening, but God
[1:01:19] is still the same. And we can believe
[1:01:21] that he's the same." Yes, I believe in
[1:01:23] all the miracles. And I believe that
[1:01:25] God, if he did it once, he could do it
[1:01:27] again. But let me tell you, let me tell
[1:01:29] you this. Even he's the same in his laws
[1:01:31] and his statutes. That we got to stay
[1:01:34] with the simplicity of the message. That
[1:01:36] we got to stay with the commandments. We
[1:01:38] got to do the little things cuz when you
[1:01:40] do the little things, the big things
[1:01:41] will happen. Amen. Amen. That's right,
[1:01:44] sir. Amen. We can look back in our lives
[1:01:47] and see and and change has
[1:01:49] happened. None of us are prevented from
[1:01:52] change. None of us like change. Every
[1:01:55] time I get up here, you're all sitting
[1:01:57] in the same
[1:01:58] place. And I get up here once a month
[1:02:00] and you're
[1:02:03] still. But change is hard.
[1:02:08] Change is a hard thing. Yes, we go
[1:02:11] through things in life that we never
[1:02:13] thought that we would have to go
[1:02:14] through.
[1:02:17] Sometimes we plan out our lives and we
[1:02:18] say, "God, this is how I'm going to do
[1:02:20] it and this is the way I'm going to live
[1:02:21] and this is the job and this is the
[1:02:23] career path and this is the things I'm
[1:02:25] going to do." And what happens? Change.
[1:02:29] Something is thrown in the wrench.
[1:02:33] Some of you didn't even know you would
[1:02:34] move to Phoenix, Arizona.
[1:02:37] Some of you didn't even know that you
[1:02:39] would be here.
[1:02:41] Some of you didn't know the trials that
[1:02:43] God would have to bring you through.
[1:02:46] True.
[1:02:48] He didn't know the cost of some of the
[1:02:50] the things that you were going through.
[1:02:53] You didn't
[1:02:54] know maybe your loved one would pass
[1:02:57] away. That you would have to walk this
[1:02:59] road alone.
[1:03:03] But change
[1:03:05] change is hard.
[1:03:07] Change is inevitable.
[1:03:15] Change is one of those things that's
[1:03:17] going to happen sooner or
[1:03:20] later. And we see it in our lives. And
[1:03:22] we all walk different roads. Listen, if
[1:03:25] you would have told me as an elementary
[1:03:27] boy that I would begin to preach the
[1:03:29] gospel to get up in front of
[1:03:32] people, we had these speech
[1:03:36] competitions every year. It would go up
[1:03:39] by a minute. So you would start at show
[1:03:42] and tell when you were just a kid and
[1:03:44] you would go and show your little toy
[1:03:46] and then as you progressed we went to a
[1:03:48] a small
[1:03:50] schoolhouse and every year you would
[1:03:52] have to speak three minutes, four and a
[1:03:54] half minutes, five minutes. By the
[1:03:56] eighth grade you had to get over a a six
[1:03:59] or eight minute
[1:04:01] speech. If you had told me that I would
[1:04:03] be doing this, I'd have said you're
[1:04:06] crazy. Who came up with spelling bees?
[1:04:10] Who thought those were
[1:04:11] fun? I want you to come in front of the
[1:04:13] class and see if you can spell or
[1:04:17] not. I mean, what do you get out of
[1:04:22] that? Please give me a
[1:04:25] definition. Hey, but as a kid, you know
[1:04:28] what I would do? I would just mess up on
[1:04:31] purpose. I would because I hated it. I
[1:04:35] didn't want it. But yet God does things
[1:04:38] and he changes the the way that your
[1:04:40] path is going
[1:04:42] because it's not our will, but it's his
[1:04:44] will. And when you begin to understand
[1:04:46] that, and the sooner you begin to
[1:04:48] understand it, the better it will be for
[1:04:50] you.
[1:04:54] Our lives are not what we are not up to
[1:04:56] our own thinking, but according to God's
[1:04:58] plan.
[1:05:00] And if Satan can get you to think that
[1:05:02] you're all alone, I want you to listen
[1:05:04] real quick.
[1:05:06] If Satan can get you to think that
[1:05:08] you're all alone, that you're the only
[1:05:10] one, that you're the only one going
[1:05:12] through something hard, the one that's
[1:05:13] hard to get up, and you know what? No
[1:05:15] matter how much you you think that
[1:05:17] ministers are always in in the presence
[1:05:19] of God and they don't have any trials
[1:05:21] and they don't not going through
[1:05:22] anything and their life isn't busy and
[1:05:24] and they're just living this holy
[1:05:26] sanctified and we don't have all the
[1:05:28] cares of life, you're wrong. We all have
[1:05:31] trials. We all have struggles. We all
[1:05:33] have things and burdens that we're
[1:05:35] carrying. But let me tell you, if you're
[1:05:37] all alone, let me tell you something
[1:05:38] this evening. Have fellowship. You need
[1:05:40] to get in fellowship with somebody. You
[1:05:42] need to talk to somebody. You need to
[1:05:44] find a friend. You need to reach out
[1:05:46] because the the sooner you can reach
[1:05:48] out. We begin to sit around the fire on
[1:05:50] the father son thing. And we begin to
[1:05:53] talk and just talk with one another, let
[1:05:55] me tell you, each one of us, oh, I feel
[1:05:57] you. I know your pain. I hear you. I
[1:05:59] need a work life balance. I need to get
[1:06:01] closer to God. I need to do this. I need
[1:06:03] to do that. Amen.
[1:06:06] You need to have fellowship.
[1:06:09] Yes. Amen.
[1:06:12] You need to have fellowship. True.
[1:06:15] You know, the hardest thing is to open
[1:06:17] up.
[1:06:19] The hardest thing is to tell somebody,
[1:06:22] but yet once you do it, the burden is so
[1:06:24] light. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:29] And as we read here, if you love me,
[1:06:31] keep my commandments and remember the
[1:06:33] laws and the statutes given unto Moab
[1:06:35] Moses at Horum. So we see in Deuteronomy
[1:06:39] 4 and verse one he says now therefore oh
[1:06:42] Israel unto the statutes and unto the
[1:06:44] judgments which I teach
[1:06:46] you for to do them that ye may live and
[1:06:50] go in and possess the land which the
[1:06:51] Lord God of your fathers giveth you and
[1:06:55] ye shall not add unto the word which I
[1:06:57] command you neither shall ye diminish
[1:06:59] ought from it that ye may keep the
[1:07:01] commandments of the Lord which I have
[1:07:04] commanded to you. So, you see, I don't
[1:07:07] want you to to change these laws. I
[1:07:09] don't want you to alter these laws. Let
[1:07:11] me tell you, God's wrote his word just
[1:07:13] exactly the way that he wanted it.
[1:07:15] That's right. And you say, "How is it
[1:07:17] possible that that in the commandments,
[1:07:19] the ten
[1:07:21] commandments, that God would come down
[1:07:23] and he would write them upon the tables
[1:07:25] of stone and it would be good for uh
[1:07:29] thousands of
[1:07:31] years?" Because it's a vindicated word.
[1:07:35] And it's just as powerful as it is today
[1:07:38] as it was then. Things that we must do.
[1:07:41] Amen. It's create Christianity 101.
[1:07:45] It's the simple things that if we're not
[1:07:47] careful, the little foxes that spoil the
[1:07:50] vine. We begin to look and see that
[1:07:53] prophecy here and prophecy there. But
[1:07:55] let me tell you this evening, there's
[1:07:56] another prophetic thing coming to pass.
[1:08:00] There's another lady that's coming into
[1:08:02] fulfillment. Yes, sir. And we must keep
[1:08:05] our lives aligned with that prophet.
[1:08:09] We must keep our lives aligned with his
[1:08:11] statutes, with his laws, with his
[1:08:13] teachings.
[1:08:19] He would give the ten commandments and
[1:08:20] we know
[1:08:23] them. And as I, you know, just go ahead
[1:08:26] and put them
[1:08:27] up. And it's things we learn as little
[1:08:31] kids
[1:08:32] and we got to memorize them and say them
[1:08:35] before the class.
[1:08:39] But you read them. Sometimes it's good
[1:08:41] to read back over them. Amen. Why?
[1:08:43] Because it's putting you in remembrance.
[1:08:46] I'm not telling you nothing new this
[1:08:47] evening. I'm just putting you in
[1:08:49] remembrance. Amen. Amen. Because when
[1:08:52] you look at these ten commandments, that
[1:08:54] ye shall not no other gods before you,
[1:08:56] no graven image, not take the Lord thy
[1:08:59] God in vain, remember the Sabbath and
[1:09:02] keep it holy. What's happening in this
[1:09:05] our day?
[1:09:07] Do we want to? If we had time, we could
[1:09:09] break each one of these down. We begin
[1:09:12] to idolize certain things. We begin to
[1:09:13] put things between us and God. Yeah.
[1:09:16] Come on. He began to do things on
[1:09:18] Sundays that we probably shouldn't do.
[1:09:20] Is there are they sinful things? No.
[1:09:22] Let's just say, but he says, "Keep it
[1:09:24] holy. Keep it reverent." Yes.
[1:09:29] True. Honor thy father and thy
[1:09:32] mother. That's the first one with
[1:09:34] promise.
[1:09:37] How many is honoring your father and
[1:09:38] your mother?
[1:09:42] He doesn't say, "Honor your father if
[1:09:44] he's good to you. Honor your mother if
[1:09:46] she's good or she raised you," right?
[1:09:49] It doesn't say that.
[1:09:51] Come on. It says, "Honor your father and
[1:09:54] mother." You say, "Brother James, you
[1:09:56] don't understand. My dad,
[1:09:57] he he wasn't much of a standard. He
[1:10:00] wasn't much of an
[1:10:01] example." That's not what it says. Amen.
[1:10:06] The greater the sacrifice, the greater
[1:10:07] the blessing.
[1:10:13] Honor thy father and thy mother.
[1:10:19] Commit not adultery. Do not steal. You
[1:10:22] see, when you read over some of these
[1:10:24] things, you can say, "Ah, I don't do
[1:10:27] those. Those are easy. Check them off my
[1:10:29] list."
[1:10:30] But then you can read in the New
[1:10:32] Testament, how do you steal in your
[1:10:34] tithes and offerings? Not giving unto
[1:10:36] God. Not giving him. You want to take it
[1:10:38] farther? Not giving time unto God.
[1:10:40] You're stealing his time.
[1:10:44] You see, when you begin to break these
[1:10:45] things down in these statutes, you can
[1:10:47] really narrow it down. You can pick them
[1:10:49] apart.
[1:10:53] But I'm not here to do that. I'm just
[1:10:55] here to put you in remembrance to say,
[1:10:57] "God, help me. Help me give you more
[1:11:00] time. Help me not take the things for
[1:11:02] granted. Maybe I put idols. Maybe I put
[1:11:04] things in in between you and I.
[1:11:09] I say, Lord, help us.
[1:11:15] We read over in Matthew because we know
[1:11:18] that God doesn't do away with the law.
[1:11:20] He doesn't do away with say, "Okay,
[1:11:22] those were for that time. Now, let's
[1:11:24] change the law." Because then we become
[1:11:26] the Catholic Church that whenever a pope
[1:11:29] comes in, he can change or another
[1:11:31] minister comes in, he can change
[1:11:33] whatever. We see it happening all across
[1:11:35] the You can look at our presidents. They
[1:11:37] come in for four years, they got four
[1:11:39] years, they change everything and then
[1:11:40] they unchange it. Then they change it.
[1:11:42] Build a wall. Don't build a wall.
[1:11:45] You see, it's just confusion. There's no
[1:11:47] You're not getting anywhere. You're
[1:11:48] going forward, but you're not getting
[1:11:50] anywhere.
[1:11:52] And people are so divided. But yet God
[1:11:54] doesn't change who he is. He doesn't
[1:11:56] change his statutes. He doesn't change
[1:11:57] his laws.
[1:11:59] When he speaks, it is from when pro when
[1:12:02] prophets would prophesy and they would
[1:12:03] begin to speak. It was from that time on
[1:12:08] Matthew 5:17, he says, "Think not that I
[1:12:11] am come to destroy the law or the
[1:12:13] prophets. I'm not come to destroy, but
[1:12:15] to fulfill. For verily I say unto you,
[1:12:18] till heaven and earth pass away, one jot
[1:12:20] or tit shall not no wise pass from the
[1:12:23] law, till all be fulfilled. And
[1:12:25] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[1:12:28] these least commandments, and shall
[1:12:30] teach men
[1:12:31] so, he shall be called the least in the
[1:12:34] kingdom of heaven. So, not only break
[1:12:36] the laws, but you have ones that are
[1:12:38] going to break the law, and they're
[1:12:38] going to begin to teach others how to do
[1:12:40] it.
[1:12:42] Be careful who you follow. Amen.
[1:12:48] But whosoever shall do it and teach
[1:12:50] them, the same shall be called great in
[1:12:52] the kingdom of heaven. You see, he
[1:12:54] doesn't do with away with the old. And
[1:12:56] the ten commandments aren't just they're
[1:12:58] just as much truth as they were then.
[1:13:00] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:04] Because we can read in Matthew 5 after
[1:13:07] the biatitudes, he says, not only uh not
[1:13:10] only those, but this Bible, you see, is
[1:13:12] timeless. So, as God begins to unfold
[1:13:14] himself, he would call his people and he
[1:13:16] would tell them, "I want you to abide by
[1:13:17] these statutes." And then he would add
[1:13:19] to them and then he would add to them.
[1:13:20] What is God doing? He's adding to our
[1:13:22] understanding. We're not going to be
[1:13:24] they're not going to behold in the first
[1:13:26] church age according to what we know
[1:13:28] because God's unfolded himself a whole
[1:13:30] lot more now. Amen.
[1:13:34] Matthew 5:21, he says, "Ye have heard of
[1:13:36] the things said of them of old, thou
[1:13:40] shalt not kill, and whosoever shalt thou
[1:13:42] kill shall be in danger of judgment. But
[1:13:44] I say unto you that whosoever is angry
[1:13:47] with his brother without a cause shall
[1:13:49] be in danger of judgment."
[1:13:51] My goodness. How do you put murder and
[1:13:55] anger with your brother in the same
[1:13:57] thing?
[1:14:00] Do you see what God is trying to do?
[1:14:03] He's trying to bring you up to a higher
[1:14:05] standard. He's trying to grow your
[1:14:06] faith. He's trying to grow you in
[1:14:08] stature. He's trying to grow you in
[1:14:10] virtue. Whenever you start the and
[1:14:13] Michelangelo would chop away at the
[1:14:14] masterpiece, it wasn't it was big chunks
[1:14:17] at the beginning. But now he gets a
[1:14:19] refining hammer and he begins to chip
[1:14:21] away things that are not of God, things
[1:14:23] that we don't we shouldn't have in our
[1:14:25] lives. Yeah.
[1:14:29] And 27. You have heard it said of the
[1:14:31] times of old, what are they talking
[1:14:32] about? The ten commandments, thou shalt
[1:14:34] not commit adultery. But I say unto you
[1:14:37] that whosoever lookth upon a woman to
[1:14:40] lust after hath committed adultery or in
[1:14:43] her heart already in his heart. Says,
[1:14:47] "Ye have heard of it
[1:14:49] said that it hath been said, an eye for
[1:14:51] an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I
[1:14:53] say unto you that ye resist not evil,
[1:14:55] but whosoever shall smite ye on the
[1:14:57] right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[1:15:02] What a powerful and hard thing to do.
[1:15:05] You see the character that is coming
[1:15:06] with this this refining.
[1:15:09] Yeah. These new statutes, what is he?
[1:15:12] He's calling us higher.
[1:15:15] If a man smites you, turn your cheek.
[1:15:18] And he says,"I have a new commandment
[1:15:20] unto you, that you love one another as I
[1:15:24] have loved you, that ye also love one
[1:15:28] another. And by this shall all men know
[1:15:30] that ye are my disciples, if you have
[1:15:33] love one for another." Amen. They'll
[1:15:36] know you're my disciples if what? You
[1:15:38] have love one for another. Yeah.
[1:15:43] Not in loving him, but in love one for
[1:15:45] another. Because in loving one another,
[1:15:47] you have love for him.
[1:15:52] Trying to do God a service without being
[1:15:54] his will. He says, "Now I want
[1:15:57] you to kind of jot this in your mind. To
[1:16:00] keep God's commandment and to do
[1:16:02] anything right for God to do God a
[1:16:06] service correctly, there is five musts
[1:16:08] to do God's service
[1:16:10] correctly." He says, "First, this must
[1:16:13] be in his time to do it.
[1:16:16] He says, "What if Moses would come and
[1:16:18] say, "Well, we'll build an ark and float
[1:16:19] up the Nile like Noah did." Well, Noah's
[1:16:22] time was right for that ark, but not his
[1:16:25] time. What if Jesus would have come and
[1:16:27] said, "Now, I tell you, we'll we'll do
[1:16:30] we'll just go up on that mountain like
[1:16:32] Moses
[1:16:33] did and get a new declaration of law."
[1:16:37] See? Uh-huh. He was that law. See, he
[1:16:40] says, "You must be in his time. It must
[1:16:44] be in his season. You got that now? He
[1:16:47] says must be in his time. It must be in
[1:16:49] his season. Time in season. That's
[1:16:51] right. And it must be according number
[1:16:54] two. And it must be according to his
[1:16:56] word that he has spoken. Yes. Amen. It
[1:16:59] must be. I don't care how how you tell
[1:17:01] me say this ought to be or that ought to
[1:17:04] be or this ought to be. It's got to be
[1:17:07] according to his word, according to his
[1:17:09] time and his season. Amen. It must be
[1:17:12] given according to the person he has
[1:17:15] chosen to do it by.
[1:17:19] I'm going to read the highlighted. He
[1:17:20] says it must be according to his word,
[1:17:22] according to his time, according to his
[1:17:25] program. It must be by the person that
[1:17:28] he has chosen to give it
[1:17:30] to. And it must come first to his
[1:17:34] prophet. He says, "And his prophet must
[1:17:36] be vindicated by the word of God." He
[1:17:39] ties it all together and he says there
[1:17:41] are the there is your five musts. It's
[1:17:43] got to go that way. His time, his
[1:17:46] season. And when he said it would be and
[1:17:49] the man that he has chose, he says it
[1:17:51] must come to a prophet. And the prophet
[1:17:53] must be a vindicated prophet. We find
[1:17:56] out many of them in the Bible it come to
[1:17:58] a prophet. It wasn't vindicated. Our
[1:18:01] prophet is Jesus Christ. Amen. So
[1:18:04] whenever I read this quote, I begin to
[1:18:06] apply it to it's applicable to our
[1:18:08] individual lives. Amen. That whenever
[1:18:10] you begin to see and you if you want to
[1:18:12] do something for God or do something for
[1:18:14] his kingdom and serve him, it must be
[1:18:17] his time in his season. It must be
[1:18:20] according to his word. If you tell me
[1:18:22] you're going to do something and it's
[1:18:23] outside the confounds of his word, it
[1:18:26] can be of God.
[1:18:27] If you tell me you're going to go and do
[1:18:29] such and such job or you're going to
[1:18:30] work for this company or you're going to
[1:18:32] move over here and whatever the case is.
[1:18:35] If it's not according or outside the
[1:18:37] laws, where are you going to go to
[1:18:38] church?
[1:18:44] You must be chosen to do it. You must be
[1:18:45] the right man for the job.
[1:18:49] Listen, just because you have a desire
[1:18:51] to do something doesn't mean that you're
[1:18:52] the man for the job.
[1:18:58] Because many times that's where we mess
[1:19:00] up. That's right. We have a desire to
[1:19:03] serve God and we want to go and we want
[1:19:05] to evangelize. And you can get ones out
[1:19:06] there that want to preach the
[1:19:09] gospel and they go and they run and yet
[1:19:12] they don't have a message
[1:19:16] and they begin to cause headaches.
[1:19:20] And you get ones that will that will
[1:19:22] pray over young people and they'll do
[1:19:24] certain things and they they'll come
[1:19:25] through prayer lines and they'll say
[1:19:26] such and such. Brother Brandham says if
[1:19:28] you pray a spirit to cast off a spirit,
[1:19:31] you might put one on them.
[1:19:34] What is he saying here? That it must be
[1:19:36] given by a prophet. What's a New
[1:19:38] Testament prophet? A
[1:19:41] preacher. So sometimes you better make
[1:19:43] sure that the prophet is a vindicated
[1:19:46] prophet. Amen. He's a God- called
[1:19:49] prophet. But I love how he beautifully
[1:19:51] types this. What does he say at the very
[1:19:53] end? Who is our prophet?
[1:19:56] Who is our prophet?
[1:19:58] Who's the real prophet?
[1:20:02] It's Jesus. When God comes and he
[1:20:05] reveals something to your heart and he
[1:20:06] says, "I want you to do this and this."
[1:20:08] Let me tell you, if God tells you, it's
[1:20:10] a vindicated prophet.
[1:20:13] He'll show you and he'll make a way for
[1:20:15] you. Amen. You can't tell me, "Oh, God
[1:20:18] told me to do this and move here and
[1:20:20] he's going to provide a way and things
[1:20:21] are falling through. What's happening?"
[1:20:24] But when God calls you to a place, when
[1:20:26] God calls you to a job, when God calls
[1:20:28] you to a position, God will manifest in
[1:20:30] through your life.
[1:20:37] In
[1:20:40] presuming, Brother Brandham would be
[1:20:42] talking to a young boy and he he would
[1:20:44] say, "God is a good God. God allows us
[1:20:46] to go God allows me to do
[1:20:48] anything. He says right here in
[1:20:52] paragraph 89, he says, "God is a good
[1:20:54] God." We hear so much about him being a
[1:20:57] good God, and I believe that he's a good
[1:20:59] God. That's right. He is a good God, but
[1:21:02] if he's a good God, he's got to be just
[1:21:04] God. He can't give us a commandment to
[1:21:08] do something
[1:21:09] another and we disobey it and expect to
[1:21:12] escape the judgment.
[1:21:14] He says he's also got he's also a god of
[1:21:17] wrath,
[1:21:19] a god of judgment,
[1:21:21] that's what makes him a good God. That's
[1:21:23] right. Because he keeps his word. He
[1:21:26] watches over it. He says, "But remember,
[1:21:29] the only way that he can be a good he
[1:21:32] can be good is to be just." And if he's
[1:21:35] just, he's got to keep his own
[1:21:36] commandments. And if he keeps his
[1:21:39] commandments, it's wrong for Christians
[1:21:42] to intolerate with the world. It's
[1:21:45] wrong. We shouldn't do it. We're to be
[1:21:48] different people
[1:21:50] and we're only venturing out presuming
[1:21:53] without actually actual authority. Yeah.
[1:21:57] We're venturing out without actual
[1:21:59] authority.
[1:22:01] You see, you have authority within the
[1:22:04] confines of his word, but when you begin
[1:22:06] to venture out, you begin to lose
[1:22:08] authority. You begin to lose
[1:22:11] power. He says it's not right for
[1:22:13] Christians to intolerate these different
[1:22:15] things. He says, "Separate yourselves."
[1:22:19] Separate yourselves. You know, it was
[1:22:22] something we were walking around there
[1:22:23] in Branson. I don't know if you've been,
[1:22:25] but it's in the south and you have a lot
[1:22:29] of different uh denominations within
[1:22:32] there, holiness denominations there. And
[1:22:35] so you see all these different
[1:22:37] people and I asked a couple of them. I
[1:22:41] says, I wonder what they call you
[1:22:45] because you begin to label, oh, that
[1:22:47] that's Pentecostal and that that one's
[1:22:48] that one's Methodist and that one's this
[1:22:50] or that one's that.
[1:22:53] And I said, "Well, let me ask you this.
[1:22:55] I wonder what you would have to do
[1:22:56] different to stand
[1:22:58] out if you had to stand out."
[1:23:02] You understand? Because here, whenever
[1:23:04] you're walking around the streets,
[1:23:05] you're different. You look different.
[1:23:07] There's not many people that are walking
[1:23:09] around with skirts and dresses and all
[1:23:11] these things. They see a modest woman.
[1:23:15] But let me tell you, our walk with
[1:23:17] Christ, this isn't correcting them. I'm
[1:23:19] saying this as a as one that you begin
[1:23:22] to ask how I wonder what they would call
[1:23:25] us. I wonder how do we make ourselves
[1:23:27] stand out in a mixed crowd like that. I
[1:23:30] wonder if we do stand out or if our walk
[1:23:32] and our dress and our and our the the
[1:23:34] way we carry themselves and the way our
[1:23:36] guys begin to dress if they begin to
[1:23:38] say, "Well, man, they look
[1:23:39] denominational.
[1:23:44] Man, that that looks a little too close.
[1:23:47] I would call them Christian, but they're
[1:23:48] they're doing this and that.
[1:23:53] I say, God, help us
[1:23:56] that we not begin to get so close to the
[1:23:58] line that we begin to border that line
[1:24:00] that people have a hard time judging who
[1:24:02] we are.
[1:24:04] Because out there, they can dress
[1:24:06] modest. They can wear the long dress.
[1:24:08] They can do those things. And let me
[1:24:09] tell you, in modesty, a lot of them,
[1:24:11] they can have us beat. Yeah, they can
[1:24:15] have us beat cuz the ones wear it to the
[1:24:17] floor length. But without revelation,
[1:24:20] without understanding and why you do
[1:24:22] those things, it's nothing.
[1:24:25] But yet when you do it as a love unto
[1:24:27] God, listen, that's when he receives it.
[1:24:29] Amen.
[1:24:36] And as I begin
[1:24:38] to to look at changing times with an
[1:24:42] unchangeable
[1:24:43] God, do we just believe God in
[1:24:46] unchanging times
[1:24:48] whenever the scripture says if he's done
[1:24:50] it once, he'll do it again? Which I
[1:24:53] believe. If he's healed once, he's going
[1:24:55] to do it again.
[1:24:57] Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:25:00] forever. He's unchanging. He's
[1:25:02] unfailing. And so, you see that whenever
[1:25:04] he's done something, it's easy to look
[1:25:06] at those promises and say that he's
[1:25:08] unchanging.
[1:25:10] But let me ask you, what about his laws?
[1:25:13] What about his statutes? What about the
[1:25:14] things that we must live and the the
[1:25:16] standard that we must hold? The
[1:25:19] representation of how we dress and how
[1:25:21] we walk, the way we carry ourselves in
[1:25:24] the communication.
[1:25:25] Do people see Christ in us whenever they
[1:25:27] see us loving one another? Or do we have
[1:25:30] bickering and fighting and arguing and
[1:25:32] things going on and how how can he
[1:25:34] forgive and he turns the other shoulder?
[1:25:40] You see, it's the small things that are
[1:25:42] going to begin to separate us. They're
[1:25:45] going to pull us apart.
[1:25:52] He's unchanging in all the good
[1:25:54] prophecies and
[1:25:56] promises. But when God calls us to a
[1:25:59] higher standard, he calls us to stand
[1:26:02] out.
[1:26:03] He begins to put things in our
[1:26:06] remembrance, put things of the the
[1:26:08] simplicity of the
[1:26:10] gospel, going back and dotting our eyes
[1:26:13] and crossing our tees. You remember that
[1:26:15] in elementary if you turned in a paper
[1:26:17] and you didn't cross your uh uh your tea
[1:26:19] or dot your eye and it's the small
[1:26:22] things.
[1:26:24] Many times we forget the small things.
[1:26:26] Amen. We do. We get busy with life.
[1:26:31] I can be honest with you. I've gotten
[1:26:32] busy with
[1:26:34] life. We all do it. And then we come to
[1:26:38] church and we and we say, "Preacher,
[1:26:39] preach to me.
[1:26:42] Preach me happy.
[1:26:46] Preach me something that's going to
[1:26:47] excite me. Preach me something that's
[1:26:48] going to encourage me. Preach me happy.
[1:26:54] And then you come and you sit and I've
[1:26:56] been it. I'm talking to myself. And you
[1:26:59] sit and you say, "Well, that was that
[1:27:01] was all
[1:27:03] right. That was okay." But let me ask
[1:27:07] you, did did you come expecting?
[1:27:10] Did you come prayed up? Did you come in
[1:27:12] anticipation? When you seek in the mind
[1:27:14] of God, were you asking God to come and
[1:27:16] walk by your way? That the minister
[1:27:18] might leave his notes that he would come
[1:27:19] and say a word of encouragement to you?
[1:27:23] Come on.
[1:27:26] Because he says, "Is
[1:27:28] my hand not sure that I can't reach
[1:27:34] you? Do I not hear the cries of my
[1:27:37] people when they call out to me?"
[1:27:40] Because we go through things and
[1:27:42] sometimes God, he gives us a no. And you
[1:27:44] ask him for blessings. And you say,
[1:27:46] "God, I need this answer. I need you to
[1:27:48] come and come on the scene." And he
[1:27:50] says, "No."
[1:27:53] And you say, "God, I I really need it."
[1:27:56] And he says,
[1:27:58] "No." But what is our attitude then?
[1:28:03] Is our attitude the same as it would be
[1:28:05] a yes? Yeah. Because if he told you yes,
[1:28:09] what would your attitude be then?
[1:28:12] You see, it's all in our perspective.
[1:28:14] Amen. It's all in how we look at God and
[1:28:18] how we accept things in God. That we
[1:28:20] don't have control over a bunch of
[1:28:22] things, but God is in control. God knows
[1:28:24] the end from the beginning. He knows
[1:28:26] everything that we would go through. He
[1:28:29] knows the hard times. He would know the
[1:28:31] valley. Yeah. And you know how you can
[1:28:34] uh uh uh hinder Satan or or or or get
[1:28:37] him off guard is that whenever you're
[1:28:39] going through a trial and you're going
[1:28:41] through a hard time and you don't feel
[1:28:43] like coming on a Wednesday night and you
[1:28:45] don't feel like serving God, let me tell
[1:28:46] you, that's when you begin to praise
[1:28:48] him. That's when you come in expectation
[1:28:51] and you lift your hand and you say amen
[1:28:53] a little bit louder. Why? Because it's
[1:28:55] coming from the heart. And God accepts
[1:28:58] the praises of his people. And when you
[1:29:01] make an effort, when you make a step
[1:29:02] toward God, he says, "Will I not make a
[1:29:04] step toward you?" Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:09] True.
[1:29:13] We just need to make a step toward God.
[1:29:26] Brother Brandon would say that the lid
[1:29:28] of hell has been ripped
[1:29:30] off in this day and he's doing
[1:29:34] everything he
[1:29:35] can to stop you.
[1:29:39] He's got all his darts. Everything is
[1:29:41] pointed at you. True. And he's going to
[1:29:44] try every tactic to stop from you
[1:29:47] becoming who you are and who you should
[1:29:50] become. Amen.
[1:29:52] God didn't call you for who you were. He
[1:29:54] called you for who you'd become. Amen.
[1:29:57] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Who you
[1:30:01] would become. Right? Because many times
[1:30:03] whenever we look at ourselves, we look
[1:30:04] at failures and we say, "Lord, I can't
[1:30:06] achieve that and I can't live up to that
[1:30:08] standard. And I see this one and he's
[1:30:10] got the Holy Ghost and and he's living a
[1:30:12] sanctified life and he's doing things
[1:30:14] and then I come and I have fellowship
[1:30:16] with him and and I just can't live up to
[1:30:19] that." Listen, stop comparing yourself
[1:30:21] one to another.
[1:30:24] Them that compare themselves to another
[1:30:26] is foolish.
[1:30:28] be begin to look and say, "God, I don't
[1:30:30] understand it, but I believe your word.
[1:30:33] I don't know how you're going to fulfill
[1:30:34] it, but I know that you're going to
[1:30:35] fulfill it. I don't know all these
[1:30:37] things. The preacher is preaching about
[1:30:39] prophecy. He's preaching about things
[1:30:41] coming to pass. I don't see it. I I
[1:30:44] don't understand it." He said, "You
[1:30:46] didn't have to understand it."
[1:30:48] He said, "Only believe.
[1:30:51] Only believe that all things are
[1:30:53] possible." Thank you, Lord. All things.
[1:30:57] It don't matter the
[1:31:00] situation. It don't matter what you're
[1:31:02] going
[1:31:03] through. He said, "All things are
[1:31:05] possible."
[1:31:10] I have heard, but now I see. He says,
[1:31:13] "That's what the church, if it's in
[1:31:15] order, set in order." He says it's got
[1:31:17] the mechanics ready. It only needs the
[1:31:20] dynamics tonight. If we'll get the
[1:31:22] mechanics ready, get our hearts right in
[1:31:25] the things that we can do. Follow every
[1:31:27] word, follow him in baptism, follow him
[1:31:30] in every order that he has told us to
[1:31:32] do. Get every mechanic ready and stand
[1:31:35] there. Then we're ready for the dynamics
[1:31:37] to be lit
[1:31:39] off. And only God can do that. And
[1:31:42] that's to drop into your heart that
[1:31:45] faith that says, "I am now healed."
[1:31:48] Amen. Then don't make any difference of
[1:31:50] the circumstance is you're you're healed
[1:31:53] anyhow cuz it's faith and by faith you
[1:31:57] are healed. You see whenever you're
[1:31:58] beginning to live a sanctified a holy
[1:32:00] life whenever you begin to have the
[1:32:02] mechanics of your life you have things
[1:32:04] set in order within your life. You're
[1:32:06] living right. You're walking with God.
[1:32:08] You're having fellowship with him. Will
[1:32:10] not the Holy Spirit come down? And he
[1:32:12] would begin to allow that dynamic of the
[1:32:14] Holy Ghost to fall upon your life and
[1:32:16] bring it to life to change your
[1:32:18] circumstance.
[1:32:22] Proving his word, he says
[1:32:25] he is the quickening power. He is the
[1:32:28] holy spirit. The dynamic that comes into
[1:32:32] the mechanics of the word that makes it
[1:32:35] alive. And it all has to work together
[1:32:39] or it just won't work. It's got to take
[1:32:42] the whole Bible. Amen. The whole Christ,
[1:32:45] the full gospel. Amen. To bring it to
[1:32:48] pass.
[1:32:50] You got to believe every word that God
[1:32:52] has said. What does it do? It kicks your
[1:32:54] faith into action. Musicians
[1:32:58] come. This is a timeless word.
[1:33:03] Prophecies are timeless.
[1:33:06] If God is
[1:33:09] unchanging, if God is unchanging and
[1:33:12] you're an attribute of
[1:33:16] God, what does that make
[1:33:19] you? You say, "Well, brother James, in
[1:33:21] this human element, we
[1:33:24] change. Things change, things
[1:33:27] happen." But yet with
[1:33:30] God, everything he's unchanging. Amen.
[1:33:36] You say, "Well, what are you trying to
[1:33:38] say
[1:33:41] with God unchanging?" Let me tell you,
[1:33:43] you should come into a walk with Christ.
[1:33:49] That when people look at you, they see
[1:33:52] Christ.
[1:33:54] You ever met a Christian?
[1:33:58] No matter what he goes through, he's
[1:34:01] just stable.
[1:34:04] and you look at him and you say, "How do
[1:34:06] you do
[1:34:08] it?" How do you walk with God when God
[1:34:13] takes your
[1:34:15] wife? How do you walk with God when you
[1:34:17] go through this medical issue? How do
[1:34:19] you walk with God when and he's just
[1:34:22] steady?
[1:34:26] His walk with God is unchanging. It's
[1:34:28] not fathom.
[1:34:32] You can't put anything to it.
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:36] I want to be that kind of man
[1:34:39] that I'm faithful, that I'm true,
[1:34:44] that in everything that I
[1:34:47] do, as I said, you can take the the Ten
[1:34:50] Commandments and you can really nail it
[1:34:52] down. We can pick our lives
[1:34:58] apart, but
[1:35:00] yet we see that God, he's unchanging.
[1:35:06] And I want my life to resemble a walk
[1:35:09] with God that no matter David would say,
[1:35:12] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:35:13] shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[1:35:17] Why? Because the comforter is walking
[1:35:19] with him. The comforter is talking with
[1:35:21] him.
[1:35:23] I will send unto you another comforter
[1:35:26] and he shall abide with you forever.
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:32] Oh man, he's made a covenant with each
[1:35:34] one of us.
[1:35:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:39] He's made a covenant with each one of
[1:35:41] us.
[1:35:42] Oh, how we so easily break our covenant.
[1:35:56] How so
[1:35:59] easy we take things for
[1:36:04] granted. And I'm talking to
[1:36:08] myself that you could be so wishywashy
[1:36:10] and you wake up early
[1:36:13] to real early to do a devotion.
[1:36:18] Maybe you hit the
[1:36:22] snooze. If you really put some thought
[1:36:24] into it, let me ask you this. I wonder
[1:36:26] if God gets up and sits in the chair
[1:36:28] next to you and
[1:36:32] waits. And he sits there and he says,
[1:36:34] "Well, I guess he was too tired to get
[1:36:36] up this morning. That's all right. I'll
[1:36:39] try again
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:43] tomorrow." Maybe it happens again.
[1:36:47] You know, God is waiting to have
[1:36:49] fellowship with you. His greatest desire
[1:36:52] is to have fellowship with his people.
[1:36:54] And we limit him so many times because
[1:36:56] of the cares of life and the things we
[1:36:58] go through. And we wake up late and we
[1:37:00] got to rush to school and we got to rush
[1:37:02] home and we got to go here and you
[1:37:06] know it's life. I understand it's
[1:37:08] change.
[1:37:11] Young people, if you think you're busy
[1:37:12] now, wait till you get married.
[1:37:18] You young couples, you think you're busy
[1:37:19] now. Wait till you have kids.
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] Life doesn't stop for nobody. Change
[1:37:30] doesn't stop for
[1:37:33] nobody. But I just want to be faithful.
[1:37:35] I want to be consist consistent.
[1:37:38] I want to be steady in my walk with God.
[1:37:41] Yes.
[1:37:42] I want to be faithful in coming to
[1:37:44] church and serving God.
[1:37:47] I want to be faithful in the little
[1:37:48] things.
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:52] I challenge you. You be faithful in the
[1:37:55] small things and watch God bless you.
[1:37:58] Watch God bless you. That's the truth.
[1:38:00] You might be going through the darkest
[1:38:02] thing right now, the hardest battle. I
[1:38:05] don't know what it is, but you be
[1:38:07] faithful.
[1:38:09] You do the little things. You stay true
[1:38:12] to God's word. You hold on to the
[1:38:15] promise. You hold on to your husband.
[1:38:17] You hold on to your kid.
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:20] And watch God honor his word.
[1:38:26] Let's stand.
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:35] But the comforter which is the Holy
[1:38:37] Ghost whom the father will send in his
[1:38:39] my
[1:38:40] name. He shall teach you all
[1:38:43] things and bring all things to your
[1:38:45] remembrance.
[1:38:49] I say God fill us. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:59] Let's bow our
[1:39:03] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:39:06] with Lord, what a joy it is to serve
[1:39:09] you. What a joy it is to know you.
[1:39:13] Father, it's not just a you're not just
[1:39:15] a God of 2,000 years ago, but you're an
[1:39:19] everpresent God. You're there in our
[1:39:21] time of trouble.
[1:39:24] Lord, you're there in the good times and
[1:39:27] in the bad times.
[1:39:29] You're Lord, you're there when we're
[1:39:32] not. Lord, you're there when we don't
[1:39:34] see you. But you're working,
[1:39:39] Lord. Lord, you're
[1:39:41] unchanging. Lord, you're un you're so
[1:39:45] faithful to us. And we we when we look
[1:39:49] in the Bible and we see all the promises
[1:39:51] that you've given us and how you
[1:39:53] fulfilled your word down through
[1:39:54] scripture, Lord, we can see and we can
[1:39:58] identify ourselves in
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:02] it. And we see prophecies coming to
[1:40:07] pass. The prophet would say five of the
[1:40:10] seven have already been
[1:40:11] fulfilled. And we see where we at in
[1:40:15] prophecy.
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:21] And Lord, here on a Wednesday night,
[1:40:23] your people have come into your house. I
[1:40:26] know they're weary. They're
[1:40:28] tired. Hard days will work, Lord.
[1:40:33] And I'm asking Lord as we go our
[1:40:35] separate ways that you would just give
[1:40:37] them a durable portion Lord. That you
[1:40:39] would give them a blessing, Father, that
[1:40:42] you would answer their prayer. That you
[1:40:44] would come on the scene. That Lord, no
[1:40:46] matter what they're going through,
[1:40:48] they've made a sacrifice to come into
[1:40:50] your house to hear your word. And Lord,
[1:40:53] we're just asking that your word would
[1:40:54] not return void. That it would
[1:40:56] accomplish that what you would that you
[1:40:58] that you intended it to do. Oh
[1:41:00] God, I ask a special blessing upon our
[1:41:03] people. Father, may you go with them.
[1:41:06] May you bless their jobs. May you bless
[1:41:08] their homes. Bless the children. Oh God.
[1:41:13] Lord, we just want to know you more. We
[1:41:16] want to serve you better. We want to
[1:41:18] live for you more, Lord. We want our
[1:41:20] standard to be raised up that people can
[1:41:22] identify. They can recognize that
[1:41:24] there's something different with that
[1:41:26] people. Yes, they're so Christlike.
[1:41:32] Lord, I just ask that you would help us.
[1:41:34] Go with us, oh God.
[1:41:36] We commit our lives into your hands.
[1:41:40] We love you and we thank you for your
[1:41:42] goodness and your mercy to us, oh God.
[1:41:45] We love you in Jesus name.
[1:41:48] Amen.
[1:41:50] Amen.
[1:41:54] Amazing
[1:41:56] grace, how
[1:41:59] sweet the
[1:42:01] sound.
[1:42:03] Save a
[1:42:05] rich like
[1:42:09] me. I
[1:42:11] once was lost, but
[1:42:15] now I'm found.
[1:42:19] was
[1:42:20] blind, but
[1:42:22] now I
[1:42:26] see. It was
[1:42:28] grace that hold my
[1:42:32] heart to
[1:42:34] fear and
[1:42:37] grace my fears.
[1:42:43] really how
[1:42:45] precious
[1:42:47] did that
[1:42:49] grace
[1:42:51] appear in the
[1:42:53] hour and I
[1:42:55] first me are your chains gone this year
[1:43:00] my chains are
[1:43:03] gone I've been set free
[1:43:08] My God, my
[1:43:11] savior, yours ransomed
[1:43:15] me. And like a
[1:43:19] cloud, his mercy
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:23] brings unending
[1:43:27] love.
[1:43:29] Amazing
[1:43:32] grace the
[1:43:35] Lord has
[1:43:37] promised good to
[1:43:41] me. His
[1:43:43] word my
[1:43:45] hope secure.
[1:43:50] He will my
[1:43:53] shield
[1:43:55] and should
[1:43:57] be as
[1:43:59] long as
[1:44:04] life. My chains are gone.
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:13] My God, my
[1:44:16] savior, yours ransomed
[1:44:21] me. And like a
[1:44:25] blood his mercy
[1:44:29] praise,
[1:44:31] unending
[1:44:33] love.
[1:44:35] Amazing praise.
[1:44:39] The earth shall
[1:44:42] sue is
[1:44:44] all like
[1:44:46] snow. The
[1:44:48] sun
[1:44:50] forbear till

[1:44:54] shine. But
[1:44:56] God who called me here
[1:45:02] below will
[1:45:04] be forever.
[1:45:10] My chains are
[1:45:13] gone. I've been set
[1:45:17] free. My God, my
[1:45:21] save. Yours ransom me.
[1:45:27] Like a
[1:45:29] heart, his mercy
[1:45:33] reigns
[1:45:38] unending. Sing it once again. My chains
[1:45:41] are
[1:45:41] gone. My chains are
[1:45:45] gone. I've been set
[1:45:49] free. My God, my save.

[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:11] Amazing grace.
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] Sunrise to
[1:46:19] sunrise, I will seek your
[1:46:25] face. Drawn by the
[1:46:28] spirit to the promise of your
[1:46:33] grace.
[1:46:35] smile. Found in you a hope that will
[1:46:42] abide here in your
[1:46:46] presence. Forever
[1:46:51] satisfied. So take me
[1:46:56] deeper, deeper in
[1:46:59] love with you.
[1:47:03] Jesus, hold me close in your
[1:47:09] embrace. So take me
[1:47:13] deeper, deeper than I've ever been
[1:47:18] before. I just want to love you more and
[1:47:22] more. How I long to
[1:47:27] be. There is a longing.
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:33] There is a
[1:47:36] longing only you can
[1:47:41] fill, a raging
[1:47:44] tempest that only you can
[1:47:49] steal. My soul is thirsty, Lord, to know
[1:47:54] you as I'm known.
[1:47:58] drink from the
[1:48:01] river that flows before your
[1:48:06] throne. So take me
[1:48:10] deeper, deeper in
[1:48:13] love with
[1:48:15] you, Jesus. Hold me close in your
[1:48:20] embrace.
[1:48:24] Take me
[1:48:27] deeper, deeper than I've ever been
[1:48:31] before. I just want to love you more and
[1:48:36] more. How I long to be deep once again.
[1:48:41] Take me
[1:48:43] deeper. So take me
[1:48:48] deeper, deeper in
[1:48:50] love with you.
[1:48:54] Jesus, hold me close in your
[1:49:00] embrace. Take me
[1:49:04] deeper, deeper than I've ever been
[1:49:09] before. I just want to love you more and
[1:49:13] more. How I
[1:49:16] long to be
[1:49:18] deeper in love.
[1:49:22] Amen. Trust that's your desire tonight.
[1:49:24] Be deeper in love with him. Brother
[1:49:26] Amos, if you would come and close our
[1:49:28] service in a word of prayer. Reminder,
[1:49:30] our service Sunday morning 10:00 and our
[1:49:32] Sunday school play at 6. And then just a
[1:49:35] reminder, the restrooms are closed over
[1:49:37] here. So use the ones on this side.
[1:49:39] Amen. It's been good to be in the house
[1:49:41] of the Lord tonight.
[1:49:44] Amen. I'm sure glad I was here tonight.
[1:49:47] Amen. If you don't mind, I just thought
[1:49:49] I'd share this with you guys. Uh, I read
[1:49:53] this this morning and was talking about
[1:49:55] the Navy Seals and how they're trained
[1:49:59] for uncertainty.
[1:50:04] And I always thought, you know what,
[1:50:06] change, brother James talked about it
[1:50:08] tonight. It's not easy, you know, and in
[1:50:11] b in business we call it leveling up.
[1:50:15] You know, you get challenged when you
[1:50:17] reach the next level. Amen. And things
[1:50:20] are harder.
[1:50:22] And we're in the seventh church age.
[1:50:24] Amen. We're in the seventh level. And we
[1:50:27] got everything coming at us and
[1:50:29] uncertainty all over.
[1:50:31] And I and I just read this this morning
[1:50:34] and it blessed me. And I thought, "Oh,
[1:50:35] God." It says on May 2nd, 2011, a SEAL
[1:50:40] team launched one of the most daring
[1:50:42] missions in modern history, an operation
[1:50:44] to kill or to capture or kill Osama bin
[1:50:48] Laden. They trained relentlessly. They
[1:50:51] built a replica of the compound. They
[1:50:54] rehearsed every move down to the second.
[1:50:56] The moment they got to the target,
[1:50:58] everything changed. One of the
[1:51:00] helicopters crashed. Timelines shifted.
[1:51:03] Every point, entry points failed. All
[1:51:06] the preparation didn't mean much unless
[1:51:08] they could adapt. That mission succeeded
[1:51:11] not because they had a perfect
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:16] plan, but because they knew how to
[1:51:18] perform inside of chaos.
[1:51:22] Thank you,
[1:51:23] Lord. That's what masters of uncertainty
[1:51:26] is about. He says, "Peak performance is
[1:51:30] a myth. It depends on perfect conditions
[1:51:33] and life is rarely perfect." What
[1:51:35] matters more is optimal
[1:51:38] performance. Showing up with the best
[1:51:40] you have in that moment, no matter what
[1:51:43] that best looks like, we're here on
[1:51:46] Wednesday night. We're here on Sunday
[1:51:48] morning. Amen. We get up every morning.
[1:51:51] We try to be our best. And we commit it
[1:51:53] all to him. We say, "Lord, by your
[1:51:55] grace, that's right." So, I just want to
[1:51:58] encourage you tonight. I'm here giving
[1:52:00] my best. Give your best to him. That's
[1:52:04] right. Let's pray. Dear Lord, we just
[1:52:06] come to you this evening. And Lord, we
[1:52:09] just want to say, Lord, we're just so
[1:52:11] thankful, Father, that we have a place
[1:52:12] that we can come, we can fill our tanks
[1:52:15] up, Lord in the middle of the week when
[1:52:19] we're leveling up. Lord, you're you've
[1:52:22] called us up to a higher place. You've
[1:52:24] said, "Come up, my children." Lord, we
[1:52:27] just want to come up higher. And we
[1:52:29] realize the consequences and the
[1:52:31] responsibilities that comes with
[1:52:33] revelation. Yes. Because revelation is
[1:52:36] not something that's just freely given.
[1:52:39] It's something that only you can give,
[1:52:41] Lord, by through experience, Lord. Thank
[1:52:43] you, Lord. Lord, we love you. We thank
[1:52:45] you, Lord. That we can call you our
[1:52:47] father. And that we know and we have
[1:52:49] confidence that when we just give our
[1:52:52] best to you, Lord, that's all you want
[1:52:54] is you want it all. You just want us to
[1:52:57] give it all to you. And when we give you
[1:52:59] our best, you take care of the rest.
[1:53:02] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for that,
[1:53:03] Lord. I pray that you'd bless Brother
[1:53:05] James for pouring out his heart tonight.
[1:53:07] Lord, that really spoke to my heart. I
[1:53:09] pray that you'd be with us, Lord. Be
[1:53:11] with all of the of us right now that are
[1:53:14] feeling the the gravity and the stress
[1:53:16] and the pressure of this age, Lord. But
[1:53:18] Lord, it's all for a purpose because
[1:53:20] you've leveled us up to here. And you
[1:53:22] said when the enemy would come in like a
[1:53:24] flood that you'd raise up a standard.
[1:53:26] Hallelujah. And we have confidence in
[1:53:28] that, Lord. And we're trusting in that.
[1:53:30] And we love you, Lord. We love you in
[1:53:33] times of uncertainty, Lord. We can be
[1:53:35] certain of this one thing. That you were
[1:53:38] always there and you know what's best
[1:53:43] and we're trusting in that. We give it
[1:53:45] to you, Lord. May you be with us as we
[1:53:47] go on our way. Bring us back here on
[1:53:50] Sunday, Lord. be with us tomorrow
[1:53:51] morning as we wake up, Lord. May we be
[1:53:54] like brother James and be ready to meet
[1:53:57] you sitting right next to us, Lord.
[1:53:59] Amen. We love you. We ask you these
[1:54:00] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:54:02] Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother
[1:54:05] Amos.
[1:54:07] Amen. Trust you've been encouraged
[1:54:09] tonight. Amen. You are dismissed in
[1:54:11] Jesus name. Go in his name. Amen.
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:55:17] I'm singing.
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:59:14] done.
