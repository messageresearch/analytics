========================================
control. Let's all stand this evening. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let's sing the first verse this evening. To was a tiny simple stable, all beaten and worn. Oh, hardly a place for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I give him control, he'll be born in me. If you believe that this evening, let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let's sing verse two. Well, outwardly I'm nothing, not much to behold, unlikely a place for his word to unfold. But if all just healed this vessel and let him have his way from glory unto glory, he'll change me day by day. Can you lift your hand? Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. One more time from the top. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Is that your desire? Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of rain and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's my desire this evening that you would just be born in our hearts. Amen. Before we go to the Lord in prayer, let's sing Healer of the Broken Pieces. Amen. We have a lot of needs this evening, but if you have a need, you didn't pen it down, there's a healer who hears it this evening. Just put it in his hands. Amen. Oh healer of the broken pieces, you touched my heart and made it new. Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it down before the men. Lord, I give my heart to you. Would you give him your heart this evening? Oh, love that saw before I knew you had brought me near to where you are. Oh, now I live to praise you. May I praise you, healer of my heart. Let's sing the first verse this evening. He's the healer this evening. Oh, you are the healer. Healer of my heart. The maker and God of all we are. Do you believe that this evening? Oh, this was me. I was the broken vessel in your hand. You look beyond the hurt and make me whole again. If you're thankful for that, just lift your hand this evening. Oh, healer of the broken pieces. Give him your need this evening. You touched my heart and made it new. Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it down before the men. Lord I give my heart to you. Love that song. Love that song before I do. Oh, has brought me here to where you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, now I live to praise you and may I praise you, healer of my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll sing that chorus again after we meet our needs this evening. McNeely if you could come open our service and pray over these requests we have here. First, a praise report from Sister Gracia Castor. Praise the Lord for his healing touch. On Saturday at work, I started having back pain. On Sunday, I came to get prayed for and I have no back pain now. So, let's just praise the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our brother Jonathan Bonga is at home with some lower back pain. He has two bulging discs. So, let's just pray for our brother Jonathan. Pray request for sister Naomi Veress. She's a homesick. Our pastor, brother Ron, he just needs a touch this evening. He's just weak in body. Amen. Let's sing that again. If you have a need this evening, just give it to him. Healer of the broken pieces. You touched my heart and made it new. Now my whole life I surrender. I lay it down before the men. Lord, I give my heart to you. Love that saw before I knew you have brought me near to where you are. Oh, now I live to praise you. Ever may I praise you, healer of my heart. Let's bow our heads and our hearts together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we count it a great honor and a great privilege that we can be gathered together. For we know your word says that where the carcass is, there shall the eagles be gathered. And so, we're here this evening, Lord. And we are hungry for a fresh kill. Father, we're hungry for the mana to come down from heaven to feed our souls, Lord. For Father God, your word says that uh that that if we would drink from the fountain of life that we would never thirst again. So, Father, come and feed us. Come, Lord, and fill our cups. Father, Lord, that we would no longer thirst for the things of the world any longer, but that we would hunger and thirst for more righteousness. Father, I ask this evening that you would come by and that you would speak to our hearts. Lord, you know the need that's upon each and every heart. You know the need that's in our bodies. You know the needs that's within every household. And so, Father God, I pray that faith would arise in our hearts that we could accept, Lord, the finished work that you've already done. I think Lord of our pastor this evening, a little tired, Lord, a little weakened body. Father, we pray that you would give him strength, Father, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. We ask that you would energize him with your Holy Spirit, Lord. And as brother Mario comes here this evening, I just pray that you would help him to settle his nerves, Lord, to lay the man aside that the lamb would speak. We love you, Father. We thank you for this opportunity and we commit all things into your hands for thy kingdom's glory. Let all things be done in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you shake your neighbor's hand as you're taking your seat this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a note here from Sister Teresa that tomorrow will be Ronnie's 58th birthday. So, let's give Ronnie let's give Ronnie a round of applause. Happy birthday, Ronnie. Amen. Uh both of brother Warren's brothers are here this evening. They're both ministers in the Philippines. So we have brother Richard. He's a belie pastor at Believers Christian Bible Believers Christian Fellowship. And then his other brother Bucky who's a pastor at Pure Word Tabernacle.

So there's also a signup sheet for food. So if you can make sure to sign up over there. Amen. How many are thankful to be in the house of the Lord this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've got to prove. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one in a million. &gt;&gt; Well, I got approve. I'm one in a million. Oh, I got to show the power of the Lord.

One who's broken. One who's torn me apart. You strike down to bind me up. You say you do it all in love that I might know you in your suffering. Though you slay me, yet I will praise you. Though you take from me, I will bless your name. Though you rule me, still I will worship. Sing a song to the one who's all I need. Oh my heart and flesh may fail. The earth below give way, but with my eyes, with my eyes I'll see the Lord lifted high on that day. Behold the lamb that was slain. And I'll know every tear was worth it all. And though you slay me, yet I will praise you though you take from me. I will bless your name. Though you rule and me, still I will worship. Sing a song to the one who's all I need. Though tonight I'm crying out, let this cup pass from me. Now you're still more than I need. You're enough for me. You're enough for me. Though you slay me, yet I will praise you. Though you take from me, I will bless your name. Though you rule and me, still I will worship. Sing a song to the one who's all I need. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Nick, for that song. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand as we change the order of service. Invite our brother Mario to come. Let's just sing Let It Rain. Amen. And that's my desire that he would just open up the floodgates of heaven. We would hear from him this evening. Amen. Would you open your heart this evening to receive from him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just worship him for a second. Let it rain. Open up the gates of heaven and let it rain. Let it rain. Oh, open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain. Let it rain. Would you open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain? Let it rain. Oh, open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain that you desire. Oh, let it rain. Oh, open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain. Let it rain. Oh, open the floodgates of heaven and let it rain. Oh, let it rain. Oh, open the gates of heaven and let it rain. Let it rain. Just open the floodgates. Heavenly Father, we bless your name tonight. Lord, we just want to thank you, Lord, for your grace and mercy. It's our prayer, Lord. Let your Holy Spirit pour down like rain tonight, Lord. Thank you for giving us the opportunity, Lord, that we have access to the tree of life, Lord. And may once again Lord may you just break the bread of life tonight Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Once again sanctify our mind on our heart Lord that your name may have preeminence among us Lord. You know our needs Lord and there's nothing we can hide in your presence tonight. Help us to humble ourselves, Lord, that your spirit may speak unto us tonight. Lord, also we remember our pastor, Lord. May you just give him strength, restore his strength, Lord, good health, and may you minister to his needs tonight, Lord. So once again, let your Holy Spirit come down upon us. And we ask this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you, musician. Thank you. Amen. So, God bless you tonight. And we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a thought come to my mind about uh Sadra, Mesak, and Abedneo. While they were throwing the furnace, there was a fourth man with them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But didn't saw it. They were not the one who saw the fourth man. &gt;&gt; It was King Ibukadar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Although they didn't see it, but he was there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just like for us tonight. We may not see him tonight physically, but he was here &gt;&gt; according to his promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not feel him, but he is still here. &gt;&gt; You may not see him, but he is still here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he he knows all our needs &gt;&gt; tonight. And he said that I send my word and they heal it. So his word is the one that will heal. &gt;&gt; He knows our needs. Sometimes through the preaching of the word, he will just meet your needs tonight. &gt;&gt; And that's we how we know that God is with us. Sometimes after the preaching, you somebody else will say, "Oh, that scripture is for me. Oh, that sermon is for me." It was God. He's speaking to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may not see him, but he is still here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Are you excited tonight to meet the Lord Jesus Christ? Because he never fails. Amen. We fail but he never fails. &gt;&gt; And whenever he said that there are two or three are gathered in his name, he will be in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe it even we don't see it, we don't feel it, but we just believe it that he will do and meet our needs tonight. &gt;&gt; So let's go directly to the word of God in uh the book of uh Revelation chapter 3. Verse 17-9 is very common scriptures 3:17-9. Just say amen when you are there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh so the scripture said because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. So the loudian um assist themselves that they are rich and increase and they don't need nothing. But God assistment is that knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable and poor and blind and naked. So I counseledled thee to buy me of gold dried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be cloth and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint the assab with alab that thou mayest see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent. So if you'll notice the scripture doesn't say not as many as love me but as many as I love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he first love us. While we were yet sinners he already died and love us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I rebuke and chasten. So expect rebuking and chastenment because we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because to rebuke and to encourage and chastise is the shows the love of God. Amen. So I will take my title of the sermon, gold dried in fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you may now be seated. &gt;&gt; Okay. So brother Warren uh welcome back brother Warren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And also brother Richard, brother Baky, welcome to Arizona. So they were their grandpa was my uh former pastor in the Philippines. So they were just single during that time but now they're married. They established their ministry and I look myself and I'm getting old. So God bless you. Welcome to Arizona. Praise God. So I will uh take uh the subject of gold tried by fire and uh in Genesis chapter 2 we know that everything that uh we can see in the book of revelation start in the book of Genesis. So in the book of Genesis chapter 2 10 it said and the river went out of Eden to water the garden and from then it was parted and became into far four four heads and the name of the first is pyon or what do you call that pyson or pison that is which composite the whole land of havilla where there is gold and the gold of that land is good. So this is the first time that gold was mentioned in the Bible. And we know that uh everything that God created in the natural in the earth in its original form speaks of greater things in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that everything that God created in the earth in the beginning before the fall was good. Just like when God created the Genesis 1:3, he said, "Let there be light." And there was light. In verse four, he said, "And God saw the light that it was good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that light came by the spoken word and light brings light or brings life and e even the even the Lord Jesus Christ my word they are spirit and they are life. Amen. So we just enjoy that we have the spoken word which is the light in this dark hour that we are living in. We are living now in the evening time and the spoken word which God's vindicated is the light of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So we just enjoy the message that we receive. Amen. It's just by the grace of God that we receive it. So in the spiritual we are so blessed. &gt;&gt; But you know in the natural the sunlight have benefits too. So I would like to take my time and there are according to medical uh uh science there are 10 benefits of sunlight. Number one is support a better sleep. I know a lot of as am uh anemia and they cannot sleep well. So sunlight according to science support better sleep uplift your mode. So research review suggests that you have a higher risk of depression if you have low vitamin D &gt;&gt; level. Getting some natural sunlight can increase the productions of vitamin D to help improve your overall mental health and well-being. Number three, increase energy. Number four, improve symptoms of mental health condition. And number five, lower blood pressure. So a lot of us have problem when it comes to high blood pressure. So sunlight can help lower blood pressure because he said that exposure to sunlight triggers skin to release stores of nitrogen oxide which cause arteries to dilate lowering blood pressure. Number six, heal inflammation. Also been associated with improving out to immune diseases. Then prevent cancer, lower risk of metabolic syndrome, stronger bones, extend life expectancy. You can have this benefit even going through the morning sunlight for five to 30 minutes. The natural sunlight can give you this benefit even if you even for just five to 30 minutes in the natural. So if we bring that benefits to our spiritual life &gt;&gt; 5 minutes to 30 minutes we become strong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because as the prophet said, you know, as a saints of God, your prayer is a million times stronger than angels. &gt;&gt; So we need to read our Bible, praise God, which is the source of life, even 5 to 30 minutes every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the natural can benefit from sunlight, how much more our spiritual life &gt;&gt; because as the prophet said, if you want to go deeper into the love of God, you need to read the word and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to spend time because in the book of Revelation chapter one, he said that you are already blessed by listening and reading the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's good. The light is good. Genesis chapter 1 verse 10. And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of the water called the sea. And God saw that it was good. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind. And the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind. And God saw that it was good. So it was good because in every seed there was a transforming power within itself because the seed was in itself. And we know in these last days the prophet was given the instruction by angel take your pen and write Genesis 1 11 and 12. Let every seed bring forth of its kind. So there was an anointing being released to quicken the seed of God. And if we are the seed of God in non seed there is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So that's why we can be born because we have already seed of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that seed was good. It was put in there. Praise God. It was not created but it was already in there. It just made sunlight to quicken that seed. And we know that we have the quickening power in these last days. The anointing was was being released that if you are a seed of God in these last days, you cannot run away from the anointing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To quicken that seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God created the whale. And every living creature that move with the water brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every wingfall after this kind, and God saw that it was good. So sometimes I wonder why God so specifically said that God created great whales. What is the significant? Why is it that so important that God put the word he created a great whale? &gt;&gt; And we know, praise God, when the Lord Jesus Christ was being uh or in the time of Jonah, it was used to transport Jonah to Nenebe. &gt;&gt; While he's running from his commission, he's going to Tarsus. God sent the whale to transport him to Nbe. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why God created the whale. &gt;&gt; So in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ, they were asking, "Give us a sign." And the prophet said, "And the Lord God said that you adulterous generations, you are always looking for a sign, but there's no other sign given but the sign of Jonah, which is three days and three nights in a whale's belly." &gt;&gt; Amen. So he identify whale's belly. So some of the version may call that the fish belly. So while so we don't need to search for different version the bible the king James version where the prophet used when he preached is the same thing that we need to use. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the scripture it's whale it's whale. &gt;&gt; Amen. So no question that's why God said when he created it was good &gt;&gt; because he know what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He created whale because he prepared somebody in the near future. Praise God. To use that whale to transport his prophet into Naobi &gt;&gt; to fulfill his commission. In Genesis 1:25, God made the beast of the earth after his kind, the cattle of terine, and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and saw that it was good. So I will uh jump from 26 to 29. Without 26, God created man in his own image after his likeness. And God created men male and female and called them Adam. So in verse 29, and God gave them her bearing seed, every tree yielding fruit for their meat to every creature. So I will jump to one uh 31. And God saw everything that he made and that it behold it was very good. So the first time that the word very good and God said it was very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because everything was already in place. Everything was good. Everything was good. What he created man in his own image and everything else it was very good. Then he rested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why all our need was already very good because already God knows all our needs even tonight. Amen. He knows our thoughts. He knows our problem. He knows our issues that we come through. And he was very good &gt;&gt; because he already is making a way. Whatever thing that comes our way, our life, whatever triumphs were, he already makes a way. And he said it was very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Man was good. His character was good. All animals was good. There was no quarrel or everything. Everything was good and very good. In our opening scripture, and the river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from then it was parted became into four heads the name of the first is pisson that is which composite the whole land of Havila and there is gold and the gold of Latan is good. Notice that this river that flow out of the garden of Eden was associated with the land of good gold and we know that natural gold speaks of dity and the character of God and gold is a precious thing and so is the gold Christlike character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a go precious thing. So the natural thing of creation are given to help us understand the higher level of creation. So in the message the ark uh paragraph 134 when he preached it in 1955 he said anyone who knows the scripture knows that gold speak of dity and wood speaks of humanity. &gt;&gt; He said you shall cover overlay it with gold over the wood. That's dity over the wood. Christ over the church inside and out. daty over late. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So gold is universally accepted as the chief of all the metals. It speaks of dity in the Bible. It doesn't tarnishness. It doesn't rush. It doesn't deteriorate. It has stood the test of time. And down through the history, it has always been greatly sought after. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For its great value and worth. And it is often referred to as God's money. So gold has a power attached to it. Financial power. &gt;&gt; So there are a lot of power in the earth. There's power of God. There's power of demons. There is power of ecclesiastical power. So there is political power, human government power, a civil power, milit power and there is a financial power and financial power is connected to the concept of gold. Even in Genesis chapter 13 verse1 speaks about Abraham went out out of Egypt and he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south and Abraham was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold. So gold is a storage of wealth but gold in nature is only revealing to us something that is a greater value &gt;&gt; because in revelation three as I read again because thou sayest I am rich in natural gold or wealth and increase with goods and have need of nothing. Notice their wealth is only in the natural wealth. &gt;&gt; And knowest not that thou was wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. So I counseledled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. So God is not talking about that we are to buy up all the natural gold of earth but that we are to pay the price &gt;&gt; for the gold character that can humble itself to the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goldlike character that we can humble ourselves into the will of God. Many people cannot humble themselves to the truth of the word and they do not have the character to humble themselves to the word of this age. &gt;&gt; Only those who are predestinated can humble themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. That thou mayest be rich and white ramen that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame on thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy asab with Isa that thou mayest see. Anoint thy eye with isol which is type of the word that thou may see. Thou may understand and understand what. So you want to see understand the day that we are living in. So this is a spiritual seeing of the revelation of the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; But before God will open our understanding to his word, we need to humble ourselves. That's why when uh uh when he preached about in 1965 he preached first the broken sistern then he preached about uh lean not unto thy own understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this last day we need to humble ourselves. Don't put our own ideas our interpretations to the word. Let us humble ourselves. Amen. and trust him because it is his obligation to open up a revelation to each and every one of us. It is not our obligation. Praise God. &gt;&gt; But it was God's grace that will open himself unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the gold of the land, we want to see uh uh we want to see how that financial power is what is being used to control the masses that live upon the earth. The gold of the land of that river that flow out of Eden was good. But the financial system of Satan Eden in this age of loud here is not good. And so it was also paralleling the character of this age to the character that man felt in Eden. Turn with me in the book of otherwise don't just uh we have I think the the board for the sake of time. 2 Timothy 3 chapter 1 or chapter 3 verse 1-7 is describing the character of people in this age in verse one this know also that in the last days so he Paul is speaking in our day &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; amen so being a prophet he saw the character of the people in the last day he said that in the last days Purelius time shall come so Purelius is hard to deal with. For men should be lovers of their own selves. &gt;&gt; Lovers of their own. Selfish. That's why the word selfie was born in this generation. You know selfie, selfie, selfie. &gt;&gt; And if you cannot reach, so that's why selfie stick was invented so that you can reach more. And though you know that selfie when you have an argument it become the pacifier. &gt;&gt; When you are no no no no selfie selfie selfie and they will postquiring and they will smile and take selfie &gt;&gt; because people are lover of themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kovus kovus having a great desire to possess something belonging to someone else. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe it's an everyone knows somebody like that covetous and you cannot blame them because they have the spirit in the last days. &gt;&gt; Boaster. A boaster is a person who brags or boasts about their achievement, their possession or abilities over exaggerating the truth to appear superior or more impressive to others. They are usually characterized by self-praise, vanity, obuse, displays of selfimportance. They are proud, feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievement, qualities, possessions of those of someone with whom one is closely associated. And the next one is blasphemeir or blasphem. Blasphemer is the one who blasphe. Blasphemer refers to individual who show contempt or disrespect towards God. His name or sacred thing. This term is associated with serious moral, spiritual violation including verbal or written reproach against God characters and attribute. And blasphemy is considered a great offense in the Old Testament and it was punishable by death. So the Bible emphasizes that blasphemy can manifest through false accusations, mockery, attributing God's work to evil. In Leviticus 24:16, it says, "And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as well as the stranger as he that is born in the land, when the blasphemous the name of the Lord shall be put to death." And we can say, "Oh, we are no longer in the Old Testament." But in the New Testament, in Matthew chapter 21, wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto you, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven. But whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven, neither in this world or neither in the world to come. &gt;&gt; So that is how serious blasphemy is. &gt;&gt; So a lot of people in this last day are blaspheing the prophet in these last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They call him this old derogatory uh words or names that he accused him but actually they were not accusing blaspheming the person but he was they were blaspheing the Holy Ghost that using is using the person &gt;&gt; just like in first Samuel when they they they they need to seek a king instead of God leading them &gt;&gt; and God told Samuel actually they are not rejecting me that they they are not rejecting you but they are rejecting me. Right. &gt;&gt; Likewise, then when they blaspheme or put a derogatory name on the prophet, they are not blaspheming the prophet, but the Holy Ghost that was using the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is no forgiveness of that. &gt;&gt; And we don't need to prove that we arrived. We don't need to argue with them because they have already received their reward. &gt;&gt; And we not even judge them. But they are already judged by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven, the son of man, which is the flesh man. But whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven neither in this world or neither. So a very dangerous thing when you blasphe as most of the people is blaspheming now &gt;&gt; they put the name of Jesus a cursed word. &gt;&gt; So this is the spirit of the age. So we will not be surprised. Hallelujah. If judgment will come. Amen. Then the next one, disobedience to parents. And even the disobedience to parents is also a serious offense and it is also punishable by death. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 21:18. If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son and daughter, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that they have chasted him, will not hearken unto them. 21 21 All the men of the city shall stone him with stone and that he die so shall thou put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear. remember, praise God, mostly of I can see you can even see it in the mole that the the children are fighting their father, shouting about their father, cursing their mothers and father. But the scripture, you need to obey your parent in the Lord. Ephesians 6:2, honor thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in Exodus, honor thy father and thy mother that the day may be long upon the land which is the Lord thy God giveth thee. Your life will prolong if you respect your mother father. So it was not limited to natural father mother but it was also praise God. We need to honor our spiritual father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to to honor our pastor. We need to respect our pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We know that not every PASTOR ARE PERFECT. EVERY pastor has a flaw. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But if God put you in a certain church under certain ministry, you need to honor the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the more you honor your pastor, the more you honor God. &gt;&gt; And if you something your pastor, instead of coming to him and and and reprove him, you need to pray for him &gt;&gt; that God give him wisdom, give give him knowledge and understanding and revelation. And if you are not satisfied, then you can find another church. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In order not to be disrespectful, you need to honor your pastor. You need to honor your father in the spirit. &gt;&gt; So if you feel you're not satisfied, this is not a place that can hold somebody. Oh, you need to be here because if you will not be here, you will not be saved. No, no, no. We are all free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the body of Jesus Christ is mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Anywhere, any culture, any place there was there is always a church and you need to find one that can satisfy &gt;&gt; your soul. &gt;&gt; But the thing is you need to honor your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to pray for your pastor. You need to encourage him. &gt;&gt; We as a minister, we need encouragement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to encourage him because as the prophet said, all the arrows of the enemy are pointing on us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, we'll be depending depending on God and we will be depending upon your prayers, &gt;&gt; depending upon your encouragement. Because if we if we have even just a small word of encouragement, it's enough for us to go on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we don't desire to be in this movie. We don't desire to be a preacher. &gt;&gt; It was God's gift sent to your church. &gt;&gt; And you need to pray for every not to criticize them, but you need to pray for them &gt;&gt; to encourage them. You need to go on because not everybody can preach. Not everybody is a teacher. Not everybody is evangelist. Not everybody is a pastor. &gt;&gt; But God put a five-fold ministry. Praise God. to edify the body until we come into the unity of deep faith. &gt;&gt; Deep faith that can change this mortal body into immortality. &gt;&gt; The faith that can change, praise God, &gt;&gt; this mortal body into immortality. &gt;&gt; So continue on verse three. unthankful and holy without natural affection, lack of instinct love and care for family member. Praise God. Truth break, false accuser, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good. Oh, there's a lot of spirit coming in in these last days. We encounter this kind of spirit day by day in our lives, in our work, in our school, whatever. Even in the mold, we can encounter this kinds of spirit. Thank God that we have a scripture that I can identify. Amen. That will not bother us. Oh, praise God. That is the spirit of the last day. That's normal for them. But we have the spirit also in our heart. For these sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive seal women. Women led with sins led away with diverse lust. So it is about warning against those who manipulate weak willed individuals with their deceptive teaching leading them away from the truth and preventing them from truly understanding and embracing the gospel message. Hallelujah. Ever learning and ever able to come to the knowledge of truth. The truth of what? the truth of what God has said in this age through his messenger and the prophet to the Gentiles. Amen. So without the prophet, praise God, you can never understand the secret things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour is not about Malachi 4 or Revelation 10:7. They were scripture that was being vindicated in our faith. And this scripture point us to Christ. &gt;&gt; And even the godhead is not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; The serpent seed was not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Justification was not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But they were mystery truth that was being revealed in our day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message of the hour is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It was Christ in you, the Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy Ghost which brings new birth to our lives. &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 4:1, and after this I looked, and behold, the door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me, said, "Come up hi here, and I shook things which must be hereafter. So John, we know and understand that. Praise God. We are already convinced it that John was a type of the bride and we are already being caught up, praise God, into an open door which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the message that we receive is not hallelujah. It's not about denominational understanding &gt;&gt; but it was heavenly &gt;&gt; message that we received and also in Ezekiel chapter one we know that the old testament was the shadow of uh uh uh old testament is a shadow of the new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if Daniel was caught up, there was already a prophet in the Old Testament that was also caught up by vision. Ezekiel chapter 1. And now it came to pass in the 30th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives by the river of Kevar that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. Parallel with Revelation chapter 4:1. So Ezekiel is captive in Babylon by this Babylonian river called Kibar. It is a perversions of the garden of Eden. It is a type of Satan's Eden. And he sees heaven open. And then Revelation 4, John saw heaven open. He was captive on the aisles of Patmos and he sees heaven open. And in this age, heaven is open to us while we are also exiled under captivity in Satan's caden. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Babylon was very rich and increased with good. So all this event peril and speak of the same thing. So in revelation 10:8 which is our scripture is the scripture that is being fulfilled to us. Amen. said, "And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the land." So there was a command to take the little book and we know that book has a word in itself. So a word hallelujah there is a word in a book. So if we take the book and eat it, we become the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I went unto the angel and said, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. As soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many people and many nations, and tongue again." Thou must prophesy again because the prophet these son of man praise God already prophesy and we are commanded to prophesy or preach the same message that the first angel was already preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thou must prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Remember that brother Brham was a son of man. So he was revealing the son of man. This son of manifested himself in a son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he give the message. &gt;&gt; But now that son of man didn't go anywhere else. That son of man was manifested now not only in a son but the sons. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God was manifested in many members body and commanded that whatever this son of man preach you need to preach the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First it was only by one man. One man who became first to mature &gt;&gt; but now that son of man is in many sons &gt;&gt; many membered body. So, we're preaching the same message &gt;&gt; because the scripture said you need to preach it again. &gt;&gt; Prophesy again. So, in Ezekiel chapter 2 verse one, and he said unto me, son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and sat upon my feet, and I heard him that spake unto me, and he said unto me, son of man, I sent thee to the children of Israel. So, a prophet is always sent to the people of God. That's why in this our day that Elijah was sent to the people of God. Amen. Because they were they were representative from the presence of the Lord. And he said, "And son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel to be to a rebellious nation that had rebelled against me, and they and they and their father have transgressed against me even unto this very day." And they are impudent, not showing respect. the same spirit and children stiffhearted or proud and stubborn. This is a lavishian spirit that is upon this people the same as what is in the people in this age. This scripture are paralleling the age that we are living in today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do send unto thee and I do send thee unto them. God is sending them a prophet just as he has done in our age. And thou shalt say unto them, thus said the Lord, and they, whether they will hear, or whether they will pervail, for they are rebellious houses, yet shall know that there had been a prophet among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words. So that's why God was sending the prophet without fear or favor. And he said, "Though son of man, be not afraid of them, and neither be afraid of their words, though Brian and turns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpion. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they may be rebellious house. Don't fold under the pressure of how evil this age has become." &gt;&gt; Amen. And thou shalt speak my word unto them whether they will hear or whether they forbear for they are most rebellious. Rebellion against God is the result of a fallen nature. And fallen nature is what? Praise God. It was separate us from the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And be thou son of man, hear what I say unto thee. Be thou rebil uh but thou son of man hear what I say unto thee. Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth and eat that I give unto thee. And when I looked, behold, in hand was sent unto me, and lo, a roll of book was therein, and he spread it before me, and it was written within and without. And there was written therein lamentations, woe, and mourn lamentation, morning and wo. This is like like the open book. There is a written and unwritten inside. So in Ezekiel chapter 3, the parallel revelation chapter 8, moreover, he said unto me, son of man, eat that thou findest eat this role, and go speak unto the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. And he said unto me, son of man, cause thy belly to eat until thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. And he said unto me, son of man, go get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. That is exactly parallel with Revelation 108-11 &gt;&gt; of the ministry of the bride in this hour. So if we read on Ezekiel, we find that what followed the eating of the skull is an economic squeeze showing us that after the bride has eaten the seven seal scroll of the message of this hour, we know then that the monetary system is going to come under pressure and cause an economic squeeze. I don't know if you are reading the news lately, there is always a squeezing of econ economic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of big companies are layoffing their employees by thousands &gt;&gt; and they said this is the first time in US history that 150,000s jobs are being cut off. In Ezekiel 6:1, thus said the Lord God, smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot. So after he eating and prophesy, praise God, there was a judgment strike. And thou said the Lord, smite thine hand and stump with thy foot and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword. And it's as a military power. We can see it now. There's trouble. There is the extension in the land because of the ice. &gt;&gt; We just don't know how large the extent will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it creates tension. It speaks of military power. They will pour with the sword and by the famine that is an economic siege. Food sanctions against other nation. And we know that food can be used as a weapon. That's why sometime we realize oh the last few the last few months there was a shortage of egg and every every everything in the grocery are just coming up because of the tariff assumption everything that's going on. There is something happening &gt;&gt; in this generation &gt;&gt; and the scripture is falling in in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not just a coincidence that is happening around us. It is scripture being fulfilled. It's just like a ple one ple here then one ple here then one pleel here. It's creating a picture. &gt;&gt; How do you get a dog to do what you want? You use food as to tool to bring that dog under your control and make it obedient. That is what the government is doing. have straight famine. Everything is higher up. No works and everything. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But praise God. It's not for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a rapture. We have a catching away to look up. &gt;&gt; But for this word, it is just this is not the end yet, but the beginning of sorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we are uh we are given a word when we see all these things look up for our redemption is draw at night. &gt;&gt; We need to be excited every moment that it happened. We need to be excited. We need to have a great expectation &gt;&gt; because expectations will create or will influence our life will influence our thinking will influence the way we walk because we are in expectation of the soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the changing of our body. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are in great expectation, then we need we need our expectations must must influence the way we think. &gt;&gt; Not think about our career, not think about this word. We need to think, we need to pray. We need to Lord give me more sincerity in my walk with you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know all these things is happening is not by accident, but it is a a red red flag alert for each and every one of us. It is a warning sign. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That we need to dedicate ourselves. We need to grow more. Amen. We need to We We don't have time for this word anymore. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Anywhere you turn here, anywhere you turn, it's always passes &gt;&gt; a warning that our time is too short. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; By the famine and by the pistin and pistin is some diseases. You see the covid the ebola salmonella that is being produced now even our simple food are are contaminated with salmonella or ebola or age or covid. This is what is being happened happening now is just the result after the bride is speaking the word of god. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that is far off shall die of pestilene and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remainth and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I accomplish my fury upon them. So we have a clear picture in the book of Ezekiel. But in the book of Revelation, it said, "And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was death, and hell follow him, and power was given unto unto them over the fourth part of there to kill with a sword, and with hunger, with famine, and with death, and with the beast of the earth." We may not know it. Praise God. But the effect of the judgment They can feel the word is already feeling it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say, "Oh, there's storm here. There's flooding here everywhere. Not only in the Philippines, Southeast Asia, Europe, everything." And they said, "Oh, it's a climate change." That's the only thing they can suggest. But for the bride of Jesus Christ, praise God. The earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. They are groaning. They are shouting, "Come on, sons. common sense. Amen. It's time to manifest. It's time to recognize your position. It's time that you claim what your position. &gt;&gt; It's time to washi. It's not time to go playing church. &gt;&gt; It's time to be serious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is the hour of vengeance. Hallelujah. This is showing what is to follow a people that have eaten to a book in this hour. This is showing us that what liai will come to after they have heard the final voice that is in the bride. The final voice to this word is the bride proclaiming the same revelation as the messenger to this generation in a matured form. Because the bride is not judgmental. We are not legalist. We just show the grace of God in these last days. And we know that if they are the bride of Jesus Christ, they will receive the same message that we receive. &gt;&gt; But if they don't receive the message of the hour is not our obligation to judge them because they don't receive the message. &gt;&gt; We just preach the gospel and it is God's obligation to quicken. If they are seed of God, praise God. IT WAS GOD'S OBLIGATION TO quicken because he already released an anointing to quicken that seed. In none seed, there's nothing to be quickened. &gt;&gt; We can be reborn because we are already seed. That's why if you are a seed of God in this last days, expect that you will receive and be born again in this last day. &gt;&gt; He love to say in dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people. But God sent Luther with a word. You just don't send messenger without the word. He sent Luther with the word. And Lutheran spoke for that God at that time. But they organized and again the pure word was lost for the organization stance toward dogmats and creeds and not simple word and not simple word. They complicate just like in our day they complicate the message of the hour. Right? &gt;&gt; When God revealed himself, he always reveal it in simplicity that even the common people understood him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; They could no longer speak for God. Then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day. The people who took his revelations from God became the living and all known of all men for their generations. When the method is failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until this last day. Do you believe that we are in the last days? &gt;&gt; There is again another people in the land. Who under the messenger will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; We are the people of that land. We receive, praise God, the messenger, the message of the messenger and we become the final voice under our messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are many weapons of mass destruction in this age. &gt;&gt; Famine is used as weapon of mass destruction. Deception is used as weapon of mass destruction in the natural and in the spiritual realm. When Eve was deceived by the serpent, it caused the mass destruction of the entire human race &gt;&gt; for almost 6,000 years. This weapon of much deception as fake news, fake religion, fake entertainment, fake AI, artificial intelligent. Hallelujah. Then there are weapons of mass destruction like the pawn and the internet, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. Yes. All of that. &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us have account maybe one or two. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not called the internet or worldwide web for nothing. &gt;&gt; It is a net that is designed to trap its prey. Almost all praise God the world is being trapped &gt;&gt; through the internet. They spend more time in the social media than the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the word of God is good. You need to go back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to pray. We know that by the message we are now living in Satan's Eden. And the character of this Satan's Eden is not good. The gold of this Satan Eden is not good. But the gold of the original Eden is good. Praise God. So in the message age, buy of me gold tried in fire that you may be rich. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now these people had plenty of gold, but it was the wrong kind. It was that gold that brought men's life and destroyed them. It was the gold that rupt and twisted human character. For it's the love of money that was the root of all evil. In paragraph 51, you better come before it's too late. So he was addressing a believer. You need to come before it's too late, thus said the Lord. and buy me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich. Are we getting it? Listen to me. Naked physically we come into this word but naked spirit we will not live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We come naked but we will go back spiritually not naked we will be dressed by the word of God in this last day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh no, we are going to take something with us and what that something is all we can take with us. &gt;&gt; We need to take something and all that something is all we did. All we can take with nothing less, nothing more. So we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God. &gt;&gt; So then what will we take with us? We will take our character, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because power aside from character, praise God, is just satanic. We will bring our character, not this character of the flesh, but the character of Christ, which is the word in us being quickened. So that's why WE CAN DISPLAY. THAT'S THE ONLY THING that we can bring us. &gt;&gt; Because we need to recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what we will take with us. Now, what kind of character will you take with you? So it's question asking question &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we will take our carter brother but that is what we will take with us but what kind of character will you take with you &gt;&gt; still a question &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; even though you are already in the message although you are already baptized in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; but we know that not everybody express or surrender everything unto the Lord They just being justified. They are being just sanctified and that's it. They don't want to go all the way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they still have their own way. &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus Christ said, "I am the way. I am the only way. &gt;&gt; If you want to go, if you want to have life, you need to go to me. Come unto me that way heaven. I will give you rest, spiritual rest. I am the way." Yes. &gt;&gt; And people wants to go serve God but not all the way. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Just like Cain, he wants to go what? But not all the way because he wants to do it his way. &gt;&gt; The queen Vastly when the king invited her for a celebration of marriage, he do it his way. Even Ammon was commanded to to be to to clean in the Jordan River. He he don't want to go he want to go his way &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and a lot of Christian has dust character &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; they just want to be seen in the church oh I am a believer I am this I am present every service I am but they don't want to go all the way &gt;&gt; we don't want to bring our character our cracker is nothing &gt;&gt; we are born in sin come to the world speaking lies praise God and we cannot this character will not please God we need to have the character of Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we need to go all the way serving the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, praise God. I cannot make it but help me Lord to humble myself and surrender everything &gt;&gt; and fully trust you in all ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said my ways are better than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thought. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what we will take with us. Not what kind of car will you take with you. Will it be his whose will it be his whose character are molded by suffering in the fire and furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this love characterless loudest young people? It's up to each of us for in that day every man will bear his own bar burden. Amen. The character that men fell from Eden is to come back into a people in this age. A character that can agree with every word of God. The same character in the beginning will be restored back in this generation. A character that will humble and receive every word of God in this generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the fullness of the w the word the character of Christ that is found in this land where this river of life flows is good. It is to be the dity again in human flesh. So last few quotes in the message Christ is the as I say a while ago that the message is not Malachi 4. The message is not revelation 10:7. The message is not about brother Brham. It's not even about the godhead &gt;&gt; but it was the truth being revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have no understanding of the godhead that there's only one god not three gods. We have the truth being revealed. The serpent seed, but the serpent seed was not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; The serpent seed is a hidden truth &gt;&gt; that was revealed in our day that the original sin is not by eating an apple and we know the story about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of grace, it was not the message of the hour, but the message of the hour, praise God, is to let you know who you are. Because in John 14:20 said at that day you will know &gt;&gt; that I have in the father ye in me and I in you. What day was that? This is the day as the prophet said. Now notice God making himself known. &gt;&gt; God is making himself known. We're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government, but by the revelation of Christ in you as God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need converted by the revelation. So it is a personal praise God. It's a personal affair with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Even when he was blessing, ask everybody who do you say I am? &gt;&gt; And some say you are Jeremiah. Some say you are Elijah. Some say praise God. Maybe you are a good prophet. Everybody has own views, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But they asked Peter, "How about you Peter? Who am I to you? What is your revelation regarding me?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Lord blessed thou thou Simon Peter because of this revelation. It was not me that gave you the revelation but it was the father that gave you the revelation. &gt;&gt; So it's not even Christ who gave the revelation. It was the father who gave you the revelation which is type of THE HOLY GHOST THAT will give the revelation to each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you get the revelation, he said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it." So it takes revelation &gt;&gt; of who Christ was in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ. As God was in Christ, Christ in you. When God did in Christ, Christ does in you. What sign did God did in Christ? What sign did Christ did in Christ? He said as the son of man, as a son of God, he said the son can do nothing within himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The things that you see, the healing, the miracles, it was not I, but it was God &gt;&gt; in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God is doing in Christ, Christ now doing in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are now the body of Christ in earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is our commission? Pray for the sick and they shall be healed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If they're beaten by the serpent, they shall be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can do miracles by because you are already a commission of Christ. Just need to SHAKE YOURSELF THAT I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need to. You don't need, as I always say, you don't need to look at your flesh. &gt;&gt; Look at the promise that says about you. &gt;&gt; Not the feeling, HOW NOT HOW YOU FEEL, HOW SOMEBODY SAYS ABOUT YOU, but what the word says about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we have the message of the hour and this message is directly pointing to each one of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. As God was in Christ, Christ in you. When God did in Christ, Christ dust in you. What sign did God in Christ, Christ does in you. Isn't that beautiful? Jesus at that day, he said John 14:12, that is our scripture that is being fulfilled. Jesus said at that day, what is that day? That day in the future and the prophet that day is this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. At that day when this revelation is made known, you will know &gt;&gt; that I am in the father &gt;&gt; and the father in me. I in you and you in me &gt;&gt; at that day. And the prophet said this is the day. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you need to know. You need to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are sons and daughters God, you need to know your position. That is the message of the hour. You need to know. &gt;&gt; He said that I am in the father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You will know that I am in the father. You will know. &gt;&gt; There is no coming there. No one can hinder this because he has already. You will know and you need to know and you shall know. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That I am in the father, the father in me, I in you and you in me. When the revelations made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At that day you shall know that I and the father are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am in the father. The father is in me. Then when the revelation comes forth, then it's I in you and you in me. There you are. That is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Knowing who YOU ARE, WHAT PART of the program of God there are you in? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is not about church membership. Because when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith? Shall he find revelation? &gt;&gt; He will not ask for church membership. What affiliations you are in, how who how long you are in the message of the hour. When the sentiment cometh, shall he find faith, revelation of who you are, revelation of the day that you are living in &gt;&gt; because I say at that day you shall know. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the revelation comes forth, then it's I in you &gt;&gt; and you in me. &gt;&gt; Remember when God created Adam, he created him male and female. &gt;&gt; Eve was already part of Adam. &gt;&gt; So when Adam was manifest in the flesh, there was a secret mystery while he was walking. And we know all the stories praise God that Adam could not be complete without the manifestations of him. &gt;&gt; Likewise in this last days, praise God, Christ will not be complete WITHOUT THE REVELATION OF BRIDE of Jesus Christ. That's why he say at that day &gt;&gt; you will know that I am THE FATHER, FATHER ME, I in you and you in me. &gt;&gt; We are part of the program of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the message it is I. He said and it was in the days of Sodom. Are we living in the days of Sodom? &gt;&gt; Not in Noah. Now remember he explained that by Sodom that this is the time of Sodom when the words going to be burned not drown. &gt;&gt; And sometimes people say maybe God is mistaken because a lot of people are being drowned by flood. But that's not it. &gt;&gt; That is just the beginning of sorrow. &gt;&gt; We know that the end will come. Hallelujah. We don't know. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week. Praise God. But our time, Hallelujah, is too short. We see all the signs around that. &gt;&gt; We can no longer afford to play church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our time, Hallelujah, the things that we see all around us speaks about the soon coming of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We need to have faith. Hallelujah. That can fade that can change our mortal body into immortality &gt;&gt; and only can give us strong is the revelation of who you are. Because the prophet said when he preached the Christ is the mystery of God. When the bride know who she is &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Because the rapture is already in progress. Amen. We know that. Hallelujah. We are we are already matured. Praise God. the message of the hour and we know that something is going wrong right now &gt;&gt; because the rapture in three phases and we know that it happened THE SHOUT HAPPENED THE VOICE happened and we are looking for the last trump of God when the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be together with them to meet the Lord in the end &gt;&gt; hallelujah it's going to be burned and this sign was to return not an ark but a god dwelling in the flesh of his people in his church. &gt;&gt; It will return again that God will manifest himself once again not only in one person brother but in many member church body. &gt;&gt; God is going to manifest himself. Hallelujah. You need to feel it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's some sometimes uh uh mostly don't feel their reality because they are always looking at this flesh, &gt;&gt; looking at troubles, looking at trials. We need to look at the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this is the exciting time. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. going to be born and the sign was to return not an ark but a god dwelling in the flesh of his people his church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now God is in the flesh &gt;&gt; fulfilling the prophet said that when Christ the mystery the three-fold purposes of God, God want to show himself. God was in Christ. Now Christ was in his many membered body. &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointed word that was in you &gt;&gt; because no one can receive this message except you are part of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's hard to receive if you have no part in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is the reality. You go outside. You go outside and show the message of the hour, not everybody will receive it. But they will ridicule you, say something bad about you. No more prophet. No more. But how about us? We just enjoy the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just feel that there's something pulling us &gt;&gt; because when the seal was open, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the scripture said that when the seal was open, he gathered all his subject unto himself. And who is his subject? The bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we cannot run away from our calling. We are called the eternal church age. This place is not eternal but our eternal connection is from the foundation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of these days we will return to that condition. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said at that day you will know that I am in the father the father in me. I in you and you in me. It's God in you. &gt;&gt; Don't look for Jesus of Nazareth to be in you. &gt;&gt; God is in his word. It's the word of God that is being vindicated that was in you which is God in you. The word of Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all Christ was, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; So it's God above us in the Old Testament, God with us during the time of Jesus Christ. And God in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No wonder we are commissioned to baptize using father, son and holy ghost. It's not three different gods, three offices of one god. See God above us in the father god in us with the son cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back. &gt;&gt; OH THANK YOU LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD CAME DOWN condescending making HIS WAY TO CALL YOU IN THESE LAST DAYS. This is your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE REVELATION MIGHTY THE MIGHTY ANGEL COMING OUT HE FIND his way condescending to bring you back unto himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into us. So it's God above us, God with us and God in us. No wonder we are commissioned to baptize using father, son and holy ghost. It's not three gods. &gt;&gt; It's one God in three offices. That is the truth that being being revealed in these last days. Hallelujah. God above us in the father god in us with the son cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And bring his people back to manifestations of sons of God like they had in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The third full purposes third full purpose of his coming. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. and bring his people back to manifested sense like they had them in the garden of Ed. The whole world's groaning. &gt;&gt; The whole world is groaning &gt;&gt; and waiting for that hour for the manifestations of sons of God. Hallelujah. They are groaning and they say, "Oh, there's there's there's something a climate change." &gt;&gt; That's right. That is a climate change they call it &gt;&gt; because that's the only way that they can explain it a climate change &gt;&gt; but the scripture said the earth is groaning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is groaning to be changed so that the sons and daughters of God can live in the millennium with peace without &gt;&gt; without trouble without hurtaches without anything. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. coming down making a way and bring his people back to manifested sons like they had in the garden of it. The whole world is groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the son of God. Take note. He has no voice tonight &gt;&gt; but yours. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He has no hand but our hands. &gt;&gt; He has your hands that whose hand it is. He said, "I am the vine and you are the branches." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope that you listen to this poor voice tonight and the little still small voice of the spirit God speak into your heart. &gt;&gt; We are not only hearing the voice &gt;&gt; of brother Brham, but we are hearing the still small voice that can penetrate into our heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I'm calling our musicians to come. I am the vine and you are the Brunson. I hope that you'll listen to this poor voice tonight and the little still small voice of the spirit that can speak into your heart and hear him say it is I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said will you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us not be afraid of what will come into this world. There will be an economic collapse. There will be a depression. Everything that we can see all around us, it seems that we are uh the world is in uh uncertain &gt;&gt; uncertainty. It create nervousness. It create uh anxiety. It create depression. What will be happen tomorrow? What will be if I lost praise God my worth? What will be if my mortgage collapse? What what happened to me? But he said, "It is I. Be not be afraid. &gt;&gt; Don't think about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; For your father, heavenly Father, knows what's best for you tomorrow. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all his righteousness." Praise God. And all these things shall be added unto us. &gt;&gt; It is God's way. &gt;&gt; You just only believe &gt;&gt; that it is I. Do not fear. He said, "Do you believe it?" Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to be so let's stand to our feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27.

So let's &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is Christ in you. the hope of glory &gt;&gt; and that is the message of the hour. You need to stand by the revealed word knowing who you are. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the circumstances. Don't look at the flesh because this flesh will always keep bothering us. But the only thing as the prophet said, as long as you are in this place, it will keep on bothering us. That's the only thing that he can do for us. Bother us. Give us negative thought. Give us something and he keep on bothering us. But he cannot take away your soul because you are already anchored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got your revelation. The gate to bell cannot prevail against it. He will bother you from time to time. But he cannot take away hallelujah. Your part in Christ because it is already being revealed at that day.
