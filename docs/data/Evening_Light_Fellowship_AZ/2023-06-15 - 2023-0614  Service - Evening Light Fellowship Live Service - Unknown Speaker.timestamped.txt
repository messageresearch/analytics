[11:47] needs healing
[11:49] and I don't know who this Josh is but it
[11:51] doesn't matter what stage the cancer is
[11:54] because we had a prophet messenger
[11:57] who said if you could but get the people
[11:58] to believe
[12:00] nothing
[12:02] would stand in the way and he made it a
[12:04] point to even call it out by name cancer

[12:11] senior is asking to keep brother Larry
[12:14] in prayer he says God bless you thanks
[12:16] for that and Our Sister Anne love all
[12:18] had to send in a request

[12:36] believe three or four weeks ago same
[12:38] thing I believe he is stable and will be
[12:40] spending the night there under
[12:42] observation I'm asking him prayers
[12:44] because I
[12:45] know it can make a difference amen I can
[12:48] I can attest to that and then I believe
[12:51] uh
[12:52] brother Donnie had sent in a request for
[12:54] his daughter Erica she's tested positive
[12:57] for MRSA and asking for the churches to
[13:01] remember her
[13:02] they did all kinds of tests trying to
[13:05] find the cause of her fever
[13:07] and tested her for that this morning
[13:10] also she's still in the ER
[13:12] and she needs a room
[13:14] none of these things move us
[13:17] we are looking to Our God's promise of
[13:19] healing amen just a great man of faith
[13:22] for the dawn he is and holding on to the
[13:24] horns of the altar

[14:13] want to keep him in prayer that his
[14:14] kidneys would continue to regain
[14:16] function from zero to 45 or 50 percent

[36:29] in-laws are here with us tonight and
[36:32] happy to have them in town and so if you
[36:34] have your Bibles
[36:39] let's turn to proverbs
[36:41] three
[36:43] Proverbs 3 and then we'll turn to Isaiah
[36:45] 30.
[36:52] Proverbs 3 23
[36:57] it says then then Thou shalt walk in thy
[37:01] way safely and thy foot shall not
[37:03] stumble
[37:04] when that lie is down thy shall not be
[37:06] afraid yea Thou shalt lie down in thy
[37:09] sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of
[37:12] sudden fear neither of desolation of the
[37:15] wicked
[37:16] when it cometh
[37:18] when it cometh not if but when it comes
[37:21] be not afraid
[37:24] for the Lord shall be thy confidence and
[37:27] shall keep thy foot from being taken
[37:31] for the Lord shall be thy confidence
[37:34] Isaiah 30 and verse 15.
[37:38] and it says for thus saith the Lord
[37:41] God the Holy One of Israel in returning
[37:45] in the rest shall ye be saved
[37:47] in quietness
[37:49] and in confidence
[37:53] in quietness and confidence shall be
[37:57] your strength
[37:59] you can have your seats this evening
[38:06] so this evening I would like to speak on
[38:08] a little different subject or
[38:12] is a subject that came to me and I was
[38:16] fellowshipping with another brother and
[38:18] as we begin to talk in this this subject
[38:20] just kind of came up and
[38:22] tonight I would like to title the sermon
[38:24] quiet confidence
[38:26] quiet confidence and
[38:29] I know that the Lord placed us upon my
[38:31] heart and
[38:33] as I begin to to look into it you begin
[38:35] to pray and you begin to wait upon the
[38:37] Lord and
[38:38] at the time I didn't have a scripture
[38:40] for it but then as we see here but the
[38:42] scripture says
[38:43] in quietness
[38:48] in quietness and in confidence will be
[38:51] your strength
[38:53] and so I began to look at quite quiet
[38:55] confidence to a believer
[39:13] it's all right
[39:15] we'll get through I think
[39:18] I think it's come through this morning
[39:19] right here
[39:20] perfect
[39:25] all right
[39:29] so quiet confidence to a believer in
[39:32] as I begin to look into it you know the
[39:34] the prophet doesn't say necessarily
[39:36] something about it but in Hidden terms
[39:38] and different things we can see that as
[39:40] a Believer they have a confidence about
[39:42] them they have a way about them now it's
[39:43] a quiet confidence there's a reason I'm
[39:45] calling it because we know that the the
[39:47] christ-like character is not arrogant it
[39:49] is not puff shirt it's not proud it's
[39:52] not anything like that but it's a
[39:54] confidence from within because when you
[39:56] know who you are and when you realize
[39:59] the day and hour that we're living in
[40:00] you can have a confidence and you can
[40:02] have an assurance
[40:08] when you have this confidence you can
[40:10] begin to
[40:12] look at your situation a little bit
[40:14] different
[40:15] you can look the devil in the eye
[40:16] whether it be sickness whether it be a
[40:18] doctor's report and know that I have a
[40:20] different report
[40:22] I have somebody else that has a higher
[40:24] say
[40:27] and we begin to trust and
[40:29] have confidence in that
[40:32] so let me ask you tonight where does
[40:35] your confidence lie this evening
[40:37] where does your confidence lie because
[40:40] we see in a world that we live in in a
[40:42] time in a in the day and age that we
[40:45] live in
[40:46] they're pushing for you to be confident
[40:48] in Who You Are
[40:51] be confident what you believe be
[40:52] confident
[40:54] and what God made you to be
[40:56] that's what they're saying because look
[40:58] at what month we're living in
[41:00] what month is it
[41:02] June what's June it's pride month they
[41:05] want you to be confident in Who You Are
[41:07] if you want to be a boy be a boy if you
[41:10] want to be a girl be a girl but be
[41:11] confident
[41:13] you see the perversion of it
[41:16] and you see this perversion coming in
[41:19] and and it's bombarding the minds of the
[41:22] people
[41:24] it's programming the minds of the people
[41:27] and now we see that you know I had a
[41:29] customer and he asked me if I was going
[41:30] to drive my Ford truck anymore I didn't
[41:33] know what he was talking about
[41:35] so then he showed me the commercial and
[41:37] it has two trucks driving side by side
[41:39] and they're covered in mud and they're
[41:40] racing side by side
[41:42] and they're all racing they're covered
[41:44] in mud and then all of a sudden they go
[41:45] through a puddle
[41:46] and one's a red Ford Raptor they're
[41:50] continue racing then the next one goes
[41:52] through a puddle and it's covered in
[41:53] rainbow
[41:55] for pride month
[41:57] right and it's
[41:58] now they're programming these people but
[42:00] the thing I don't understand
[42:02] is Ford's motto and stuff is Built Tough
[42:06] now tell me what's tough about that
[42:09] what is tough about that but you see
[42:12] they're just bombarding the minds of the
[42:14] people
[42:16] and it's the world we live in and I'm
[42:18] sure you see it everywhere and you go
[42:19] into stores and now Target is targeting
[42:22] the the children and now they have from
[42:24] babies they can have mixed uh bathing
[42:27] suits and all these gender neutral all
[42:30] these different things now they're going
[42:31] at the kids
[42:32] God forbid how as the years go on what
[42:36] will this world be
[42:38] you see the progression of it
[42:42] but yet if they have that confidence
[42:45] I can have another confidence that this
[42:48] world is not my home
[42:50] that I'm going to a city whose Builder
[42:53] and maker is gone then I'm going to that
[42:55] City and God has created us and we can
[42:58] have a confidence and we can have an
[43:00] assurance that in this world that we're
[43:02] living in
[43:03] that if they're programming the minds of
[43:06] those kids help us God to program the
[43:08] minds of our kids to have confidence in
[43:11] who they are that we don't need a month
[43:13] to tell us and be proud of who we are
[43:16] but I got 12 months out of the year to
[43:18] declare that I'm a Christian
[43:19] they got 365 days a year to profess
[43:22] profess Christianity to live Christ
[43:26] to be confident in who I am
[43:33] we have a right to be confident
[43:36] because it's what God called us to be
[43:43] you have to put your confidence in
[43:45] something
[43:47] you have to put your confidence in
[43:49] something
[43:51] you see even from a young age and kids
[43:54] I can take Nolan for an example we have
[43:56] a swimming pool
[43:57] and the kid will jump in no fear but he
[44:00] has the confidence that Dad will catch
[44:01] him
[44:03] we're teaching them to swim but he has
[44:05] the confidence in the little young the
[44:08] the
[44:10] at his early age he doesn't realize
[44:15] the danger that lays before him
[44:20] the danger that lays before him that
[44:23] whenever he jumps in that pool he has
[44:25] the confidence that dad's going to catch
[44:27] him but if I could say it this way he's
[44:29] a moment from death
[44:31] we see death all over from kids drowning
[44:34] in pools but yet he doesn't even realize
[44:36] the confidence
[44:38] that he's placing in his dad's hands
[44:42] he doesn't realize even when I was a you
[44:45] know you're younger and you're growing
[44:46] up and as long as Dad is there
[44:48] everything's gonna be all right
[44:50] the confidence is there the Assurance is
[44:53] there
[44:54] I can remember going we went to a
[44:57] reservation Lake and when we used to go
[44:59] to Holly Lake and before Holly Lake and
[45:01] we'd go to reservation a few days before
[45:03] and we'd go well anyway we went on this
[45:05] hike
[45:07] we went to the little storefront there
[45:09] at Reservation Lake and
[45:11] the the Indian man there said yeah you
[45:14] know we there was a creek that branched
[45:16] off from the lake and it ran supposedly
[45:18] to the other Lake
[45:20] well that's what he told us
[45:23] and said he said it was a couple miles
[45:25] Downstream if you walk it and so we were
[45:27] walking you know we walked part of it
[45:29] one day and we were fishing we were
[45:31] catching these brown trout and all these
[45:32] different things we're having a good
[45:33] time we're like oh well let's just walk
[45:35] to the next Lake because this man told
[45:37] us that it connected so he sent my mom
[45:40] to the other Lake you'll pick us up at
[45:41] this time
[45:42] and so my dad and my brothers when we
[45:45] get all our gear together and us boys
[45:47] you know when you're you're young you
[45:48] just pack your fishing pole that's the
[45:50] essential you don't care about food you
[45:52] don't care about water and why because
[45:53] Dad's got it covered
[45:57] so we had this confidence that
[45:59] because Dad was with us
[46:02] when we get to walking and it was
[46:04] supposed to be like a mile maybe too if
[46:06] I remember correctly
[46:08] well five hours later it seemed like
[46:11] forever we're still walking this Creek
[46:13] the creek runs out there is no other
[46:15] Lake
[46:16] no service no nothing
[46:19] but yet I had a confidence because I was
[46:21] with Dad
[46:23] I had an assurance that I was with Dad
[46:28] and as we kept walking
[46:30] the other boys
[46:32] the other brothers got tired and
[46:35] we would have to I would stick with Dad
[46:37] because I knew if I didn't lose dad I
[46:39] was going to be all right
[46:42] and so we would leave back a a food
[46:44] trail for him we'd leave water at this
[46:46] stump and then an Apple at this stump
[46:48] and a banana at this dump just so that
[46:50] they would keep on the same Trail
[46:52] but yet what I'm getting at is I never
[46:55] lost confidence
[46:56] because I was with Dad but yet we have
[46:59] another Heavenly Father
[47:03] we have another Heavenly Father Who
[47:06] Watches Over Us who protects us we sing
[47:08] the song I have a father before the
[47:11] world began
[47:13] before the world began I was in him
[47:16] and we have that assurance
[47:21] we have that confidence
[47:23] in our heavenly father
[47:27] and you see many times
[47:30] when we can trust
[47:31] in that confidence that we have in God
[47:36] that everything's going to be all right
[47:40] everything's going to be all right
[47:43] you see many times whenever I come to
[47:44] the pulpit I realize behind that door
[47:46] I'm nervous I can carry the burden of
[47:49] the responsibility but I have a
[47:51] confidence that whenever I walk through
[47:53] that door that God is going to speak to
[47:55] his people that God is going to minister
[47:58] a word to the needs of his people but
[48:00] you have to have that approach you guys
[48:02] have to come with a confidence in the
[48:04] minister not in a man but in the gift of
[48:07] God
[48:08] because many times where we go wrong is
[48:10] we begin to you know if I were to say
[48:12] something and it hits down home or you
[48:14] might take it as it's from me the man
[48:17] James
[48:18] but you got to realize that that's how
[48:20] God speaks to his people that's how God
[48:24] ministers to the hearts of your people
[48:25] that if a minister can get behind the
[48:28] sacred desk and minister to the needs
[48:30] that are on your heart
[48:34] but you have to have a confidence you
[48:37] have to have an assurance
[48:41] brother Branham says in Revelation
[48:43] chapter 5 61 he says
[48:45] I think it's come to a time that when
[48:47] we've got to know how we stand
[48:52] how can you do anything unless you've
[48:54] got faith in what you're doing you've
[48:56] got to have faith and that's my purpose
[48:58] of doing this with the church here is to
[49:01] give the Believers faith and confidence
[49:04] in what they're standing for because it
[49:06] is the word of the Lord then as long as
[49:09] through the scripture it's sovereignly
[49:10] placed from Genesis to revelations back
[49:13] and forth and up and down and not a way
[49:15] for the devil to move in there anyway
[49:18] anywhere then you've got perfect
[49:21] confidence
[49:22] you see you know where you're standing
[49:26] it's not just a confidence but it's a
[49:28] perfect confidence
[49:32] you know it's a I begin to think and the
[49:35] perfect confidence and it's the
[49:37] confidence that Elijah had when the army
[49:40] of Syria came looking for him
[49:43] let's read in our Bible Second Kings six
[49:49] second king six
[49:50] in verse 8
[49:57] then the king of Syria award against
[49:58] Israel and took counsel with his servant
[50:01] saying in such and such a place shall be
[50:03] thy camp
[50:05] and the man of God sent unto the king of
[50:08] Israel saying beware that thou has that
[50:10] thou pass not such a place for thither
[50:13] the syrians or come down
[50:15] and the king of Israel sent to the place
[50:18] which the man of God told him and warned
[50:21] him of and saved him there not once nor
[50:24] twice
[50:26] therefore the heart of the king of Syria
[50:28] was sore troubled with of these for
[50:29] these things and he called his servants
[50:33] and said unto them will ye not show me
[50:35] which of us is for the king of Israel
[50:39] show me the traitor amongst us
[50:42] he thought there was somebody giving
[50:43] away his tactics so he thought somebody
[50:45] was giving away his secrets
[50:48] and one of the servants said none my
[50:50] Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that
[50:53] is in Israel telleth the king of Israel
[50:55] the words that thou speaketh in thy
[50:58] chain bed chamber
[51:01] you see that's why you got to have
[51:02] confidence in man of God that's why you
[51:05] got to have confidence in a god-called
[51:06] pastor
[51:07] that's why you have confidence in them
[51:09] in the prophet of this day why because
[51:12] the prophet is a force here
[51:14] he tells you where the enemy is he tells
[51:17] you his tactics he's telling you where
[51:18] he's going to be he says don't go down
[51:20] that route there's trouble ahead don't
[51:22] take that job don't take don't go in
[51:24] this direction what is it God's watching
[51:27] out for you
[51:30] that's why you got to have confidence in
[51:32] that man
[51:33] so you can respect his advice and his
[51:36] Direction
[51:40] and he said go
[51:43] and spy where he is that I may send and
[51:46] fetch him
[51:47] and it was told him saying behold he is
[51:50] in Dothan
[51:51] or dolphin
[51:53] therefore sin
[51:55] he thither horses and chariots and a
[51:58] great host and
[52:00] there came by Night encompassed the city
[52:02] about when the servant of the man of God
[52:04] was risen early and gone forth Behold a
[52:07] host compassed the city both with horses
[52:09] and chariots and his servants said unto
[52:12] him alas my master how shall we do
[52:16] what should we do
[52:19] and he answered fear not for they that
[52:22] be with us are more than they that be
[52:24] with him
[52:25] you see Elijah had a confidence
[52:28] he had an assurance he knew who God was
[52:31] I can imagine that servant and sitting
[52:33] there wondering I only count two of us
[52:38] there's only two of us
[52:39] and all of them now tell me how is that
[52:42] possible
[52:44] because if you're looking with your
[52:45] natural eyes you'll miss it
[52:48] if you're looking at your circumstances
[52:51] through your natural eye you'll miss it
[52:56] and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray
[52:59] thee open his eyes that he may see and
[53:01] the Lord opened the eyes of the young
[53:03] man and he saw him behold the mountains
[53:05] was full of horses and Chariots of Fire
[53:07] round about Elisha you see I pray that
[53:10] God would do the same thing tonight that
[53:12] he would show that there is more of us
[53:14] than there is with them that there's
[53:17] more of us there's more with you there's
[53:19] more
[53:21] that back you then the Devils you're
[53:23] facing then the trials you're going
[53:25] through then the circumstance
[53:30] there's more of us than the enemies we
[53:34] are facing
[53:36] and we know the rest of the story and
[53:38] I'll save it for time
[53:40] but we know that the men came down and
[53:42] God blinded the eyes of those men
[53:47] he blinded the eyes of his enemy
[53:51] and he was even able to lead his enemy
[53:54] you see when you have confidence in God
[53:58] you get to direct your enemy
[54:00] you get to tell him you get to stand
[54:03] against him
[54:11] Psalms 118 and 8 says it is better to
[54:14] trust in the Lord than to put confidence
[54:17] in a man
[54:20] you see men will fail you
[54:22] a job will fail you
[54:26] naturally things will fail you but God
[54:28] will never fail you
[54:31] you can have perfect confidence in that
[54:37] our confidence should lie on nothing
[54:39] less than Jesus Christ and no matter the
[54:41] situation
[54:43] we can have confidence in it
[54:46] no matter the situations we Face even
[54:48] within our church and the prayer
[54:49] requests have gone forth
[54:52] brother Neil it seems like an impossible
[54:54] situation what was in a possible
[54:56] situation
[54:57] but yet you can have confidence that God
[54:59] is working all things for his good
[55:02] that Josiah even though he's down in
[55:04] Florida in the different circumstances
[55:06] God is working all things for his good
[55:09] we can have confidence that he's has it
[55:12] all in his hands
[55:17] the reason
[55:19] that we can have confidence in that
[55:22] because God has already paid the price
[55:25] God has already done the work God has
[55:28] already done the work and paid the price
[55:29] for your deliverance he's already paid
[55:31] it for healing
[55:34] God has already done the work
[55:39] and I begin to think on
[55:42] there was one hopeless situation
[55:45] that we would say was hopeless in the
[55:47] Bible and there was a woman that was
[55:49] ill-famed and a bad reputation and one
[55:51] that if you were associated with her you
[55:54] would
[55:55] be looked down upon
[56:00] a woman that many would say there was no
[56:02] chance there was no hope
[56:08] this woman named Rahab
[56:12] was a part of God's plan
[56:16] she was a part of the taking down of a
[56:19] stronghold
[56:22] Naturally Speaking though we look at the
[56:24] circumstance
[56:26] as hopeless
[56:28] God gives hope to the Hopeless
[56:37] you see after she hit the spies
[56:40] those spies gave her a
[56:42] a token
[56:45] that if you throw the scarlet cord out
[56:48] of the window
[56:51] not only you
[56:54] but your household will be saved
[56:56] that's why I keep this scarlet cord in
[56:58] my Bible
[57:00] as a reminder see
[57:02] I know that God
[57:04] honors the scarlet cord
[57:07] what is it it's a token given to you
[57:09] that the price has been paid that
[57:12] Redemption has already happened
[57:14] that if I have confidence in those spy's
[57:16] words if I have confidence we have had
[57:19] confidence in the in those spies words
[57:21] that there is protection
[57:24] that destruction was coming
[57:26] but if I had to scarlet cord it was a
[57:28] token
[57:30] for safety
[57:31] not only for me but for my family
[57:35] it's the same thing that happened
[57:39] in Israel or in Egypt with the children
[57:42] of Israel we know this
[57:45] Saints we can't go so far without
[57:48] and I listened the other day on the
[57:51] token it's a good sermon
[57:53] it's a good reminder
[57:55] it's something that you should Refresh
[57:57] on all the time why because the token is
[57:59] what's going to get you out of here the
[58:01] token being applied to your life is
[58:03] what's going to get you out of here
[58:04] that's what's going to be protected I
[58:06] can imagine the young men the oldest
[58:09] Sons
[58:10] in Egypt dad are you sure the tokens
[58:13] apply dad are you sure are you sure
[58:15] we're doing everything we can
[58:18] are we protected
[58:19] am I safe
[58:22] because the token must be applied to our
[58:24] homes
[58:25] we cannot Jeep in the token
[58:29] we must apply it
[58:31] in 2023 we must have the token applied
[58:34] and not just applied to our house but to
[58:37] apply to the doorposts of our hearts
[58:39] because wherever I go that token goes
[58:42] and I know that I'm covered
[58:50] you see if you know
[58:56] if you know
[58:57] that you got the token
[58:59] you can have confidence in that
[59:04] if I bought a ticket a plane ticket I
[59:08] know that the price has been paid and I
[59:09] got confidence in that ticket
[59:12] I can have confidence no matter who
[59:15] tries to stop me I know that I've
[59:16] already paid it
[59:18] I know that I got a spot on that plane
[59:21] it's the same thing
[59:24] if you got the token applied if you got
[59:26] the token in your life there is a spot
[59:28] in glory for you there's a spot in
[59:30] heaven for you
[59:32] nobody can fulfill that nobody can take
[59:34] that place from you that's yours and you
[59:36] gotta claim it
[59:41] it's that quiet confidence from within
[59:45] full obedience to the word entitles you
[59:47] to the token
[59:50] full obedience not partial
[59:53] not what you think or what you want to
[59:55] squeeze in or the prophet didn't mean
[59:57] this or he didn't mean that or maybe we
[59:59] can get by with this that's when we
[1:00:00] cheapen the token
[1:00:02] when you say I've been in this message
[1:00:04] for 20 years in the last 10 years I've
[1:00:06] been living the same I've been doing the
[1:00:07] same I've been I'm fine
[1:00:11] but is that token
[1:00:14] applied
[1:00:19] it's the confidence that the shunami
[1:00:21] woman had
[1:00:22] with Elisha
[1:00:25] you know the story spoke to me and the
[1:00:27] prophet uses this line concerning her
[1:00:29] approach and the other day we spoke with
[1:00:31] the young people about having the right
[1:00:33] approach
[1:00:35] and approaching God the right way
[1:00:37] because if you approach it the right way
[1:00:38] you can have confidence in the way that
[1:00:40] you've approached it
[1:00:45] in that your attitude toward your
[1:00:47] approach is everything
[1:00:49] your attitude to your approach is
[1:00:51] everything
[1:00:53] if you have a bad attitude and you come
[1:00:55] to God and I deserve this and give me
[1:00:56] this and do this for me and I need this
[1:00:59] and this is the way it has to be your
[1:01:01] approach is wrong
[1:01:04] but we must check our attitude toward
[1:01:06] our approach
[1:01:09] because here
[1:01:11] in Inspiration 56
[1:01:14] it was just one sentence that kind of
[1:01:16] spoke to me
[1:01:18] he says if you want to find a favor from
[1:01:21] God
[1:01:22] be a favor to God
[1:01:26] if you want a favor
[1:01:29] from God
[1:01:30] be a favor
[1:01:32] to God
[1:01:34] you understand what that says
[1:01:38] if you want something from God do
[1:01:39] something for God
[1:01:42] if you want something from God do
[1:01:44] something for God
[1:01:45] what can I do for you today
[1:01:48] who can I reach out to who can I text
[1:01:50] who can I call
[1:01:55] if you want to be you want a favor be a
[1:01:58] favor
[1:02:01] he also preaches a sermon called he
[1:02:03] cares do you care
[1:02:06] he cares do you care because when you
[1:02:08] begin to care
[1:02:10] when you begin to put God first in your
[1:02:12] life
[1:02:16] then he'll begin to care he'll be care
[1:02:18] begin to care about that situation
[1:02:20] you're going through that trial you
[1:02:21] can't overcome
[1:02:25] when you begin to care he cares
[1:02:29] and we see that this woman
[1:02:32] and we'll we'll turn in Second Kings
[1:02:34] Four
[1:02:37] this woman was promised a baby and and
[1:02:39] we know the story that you know the baby
[1:02:41] would go out and be raised and be
[1:02:44] working in the field with the father and
[1:02:45] the and then the baby would end up dying
[1:02:47] the Young The Young Lad would end up
[1:02:49] dying and
[1:02:52] the the mother there would be take the
[1:02:54] baby into
[1:02:56] prophets bed and brother Branham says
[1:02:58] what a place to put them
[1:03:00] what a place to take him is to the
[1:03:02] prophets because we know be a favor
[1:03:06] we know that her approach in this
[1:03:08] situation was that the prophet would
[1:03:10] pass by their house
[1:03:14] the prophet would come by their house
[1:03:15] and
[1:03:16] she was like what can I do what can I do
[1:03:20] and so she made this little house for
[1:03:22] the for the prophet for Elisha and he
[1:03:24] would begin to be able to rest and Abed
[1:03:26] and we know the story
[1:03:29] and God would honor her faith
[1:03:33] she didn't come to the the prophet there
[1:03:35] and say I need I have this need I have
[1:03:37] this desire
[1:03:39] but yet she was a favor and God
[1:03:40] discerned her heart and gave her a child
[1:03:43] and we know that the baby died and
[1:03:47] she was inspired and had this confidence
[1:03:49] that if I can get to the man of God
[1:03:53] I have a confidence that if I can get to
[1:03:55] that man of God that he can change his
[1:03:57] circumstance
[1:03:59] let us read in Second Kings 4 and 22.
[1:04:05] and he called into her husband and said
[1:04:08] send me I pray thee one of the young men
[1:04:11] and one of the asses that I may run to
[1:04:15] the man of God and come again and he
[1:04:17] said wherefore wilt thou go to him today
[1:04:21] it is neither New Moon nor Sabbath and
[1:04:23] she says it shall be well
[1:04:27] it shall be well you see she had a
[1:04:29] confidence that if I can get to that man
[1:04:32] that the man of God will change my
[1:04:34] circumstance
[1:04:38] you see whatever you place confidence in
[1:04:42] I'm going to stop right there
[1:04:44] whatever you place confidence in God
[1:04:46] will honor that
[1:04:47] I do believe that
[1:04:50] I do believe that whatever circumstance
[1:04:52] you're going through
[1:04:54] maybe it's a sickness whatever it might
[1:04:55] be
[1:04:57] and I've had it in my life
[1:04:59] that whatever you put confidence in God
[1:05:01] will honor that if you need hands laid
[1:05:03] on you God will honor that
[1:05:05] if you go through a prayer line God will
[1:05:07] honor that if you can speak the word God
[1:05:09] will honor that because you have
[1:05:11] confidence in God's word it doesn't get
[1:05:14] away with one or the other but it's all
[1:05:16] of them what do you have confidence in
[1:05:18] God will honor your faith
[1:05:25] it shall be well verse 24 and then she
[1:05:29] saddled in the ass and said to her
[1:05:31] servant drive and go further it's like
[1:05:33] not thy riding for me except I bid thee
[1:05:37] so she went and came unto the man of God
[1:05:39] to the Mount Carmel and it came to pass
[1:05:41] when the man saw
[1:05:43] her afar off
[1:05:44] that he said to gehazi his servant
[1:05:47] behold Yonder is a shunamite
[1:05:51] run now I pray thee to meet her
[1:05:53] and say unto her is it well with thee is
[1:05:56] it well with thy husband is it well with
[1:05:57] thy child and she answered it is well
[1:06:02] it is well why
[1:06:05] because she had a confidence
[1:06:07] listen this your circumstances your
[1:06:10] situations might not always be well but
[1:06:13] when you know the one that is well all
[1:06:15] is well
[1:06:17] when you know the one that can pay the
[1:06:19] price the one that's redeemed you the
[1:06:21] one that's
[1:06:29] you see the situation might be hard
[1:06:32] it might be impossible but it is well
[1:06:38] and when she came to the man of God to
[1:06:40] the hill she caught him at the feet in
[1:06:42] gehazi came near to thrust her away and
[1:06:45] the man of God said let her alone for
[1:06:46] her soul is vexed within her
[1:06:49] and the Lord hath hid it from me and
[1:06:51] hath not told me
[1:06:53] so you're telling me that God doesn't
[1:06:55] tell His prophets everything
[1:06:59] God doesn't show them everything
[1:07:03] why
[1:07:04] because confidence just can't lie in the
[1:07:06] man
[1:07:08] confidence just can't lie in the man
[1:07:10] that the prophet do everything he
[1:07:11] wouldn't need confidence
[1:07:13] in a gift that's in his life
[1:07:16] but yet God doesn't show him everything
[1:07:19] because they still need confidence in
[1:07:21] God they still need leadership they can
[1:07:23] do nothing unless the father show them
[1:07:25] that's what Jesus said I can do nothing
[1:07:27] unless the father first show me
[1:07:30] right
[1:07:33] so we don't just get our confidence from
[1:07:35] a man but we get our confidence from the
[1:07:37] god in the man
[1:07:39] that's where it lies
[1:07:43] and then she said I desire did I desire
[1:07:46] thee a son my Lord did I not say Do not
[1:07:50] deceive me then he said to gehazi gird
[1:07:54] up that loins and take thy staff my
[1:07:56] staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou
[1:07:59] meet any man salute him not and if any
[1:08:01] salute the answer him not again and lay
[1:08:04] my staff upon his faith on the face of
[1:08:07] the child
[1:08:10] and the mother of the child said as the
[1:08:12] Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will
[1:08:15] not leave thee and he arose
[1:08:18] and followed her
[1:08:20] you see she had confidence in something
[1:08:22] greater
[1:08:24] she had confidence in something she went
[1:08:26] there for a purpose
[1:08:29] she knew exactly what she was going
[1:08:32] there for
[1:08:34] it wasn't the staff it wasn't the
[1:08:36] servant
[1:08:37] because she knew that if I can get the
[1:08:39] man if I can get this prophet
[1:08:42] there's a God inside this prophet
[1:08:46] and gehazi passed on before them laid
[1:08:49] the staff upon the child and
[1:08:51] there was neither voice nor hearing
[1:08:54] wherefore he went again to meet him and
[1:08:56] told him saying the child is not awake
[1:08:58] and when Elisha came to the house behold
[1:09:00] the child was dead and laid upon his bed
[1:09:03] and he went there for and shut the door
[1:09:05] 20 upon them Twain
[1:09:08] and prayed unto the Lord
[1:09:12] and he went
[1:09:16] and he went and laid upon the child and
[1:09:19] put his mouth upon his mouth and his
[1:09:20] eyes upon his eyes and
[1:09:23] his eye hands upon his hands and
[1:09:25] stretched himself upon the child and
[1:09:29] the Flesh of the child waxed warm
[1:09:34] now I began to think
[1:09:40] that he laid himself upon the child
[1:09:43] his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon
[1:09:45] his eye
[1:09:46] what was he doing
[1:09:48] he was breathing the breath of life into
[1:09:50] him
[1:09:53] just like God did with Adam in the
[1:09:56] Garden of Eden that same God came down
[1:10:00] and breathed the breath of life into
[1:10:02] this young boy
[1:10:04] and even us today when we are dead in
[1:10:07] sins dead in trespasses the Breath of
[1:10:09] Life comes and he breathes the breath of
[1:10:12] life into our bodies
[1:10:14] to come to life
[1:10:18] that same God
[1:10:20] that was in the garden is the same God
[1:10:23] breathing the Breath of Life
[1:10:25] into this boy
[1:10:27] and we know that then he returned and
[1:10:29] walked into the house and for walked to
[1:10:31] and fro went up and stretched himself
[1:10:33] upon and the child sneezed seven times
[1:10:37] Why seven times
[1:10:40] because the work was finished
[1:10:46] my confidence lays in nothing else
[1:10:50] in Jesus Christ that same God
[1:10:54] breathing the breath of life he does the
[1:10:56] same thing today
[1:10:58] he's breathing upon his people he's
[1:11:01] bringing life to his people
[1:11:07] you see you can only
[1:11:09] if you don't got confidence in something
[1:11:10] it can't help you or do anything for you
[1:11:20] if you don't got confidence in something
[1:11:21] we can't help you or do anything for you
[1:11:24] but yet I'm so thankful
[1:11:28] that God has proved his word that we can
[1:11:30] have a time-tested memorial that we can
[1:11:34] have a Bible that shows us who we are
[1:11:37] that reveals us that gives us confidence
[1:11:39] in his word that he says I'll be with
[1:11:41] you even in you
[1:11:46] what is he getting us to
[1:11:51] what is he getting us to what kind of
[1:11:53] confidence should we have
[1:11:55] a perfect kind of confidence
[1:11:57] acquired confidence
[1:12:01] what is this quiet confidence
[1:12:04] what is this quiet confidence
[1:12:08] it's a third pool confidence
[1:12:11] don't tell anybody
[1:12:13] it's not a public show
[1:12:16] it's a third pool
[1:12:19] you can have confidence from within
[1:12:21] not everybody's gonna know it's not for
[1:12:24] everybody
[1:12:25] but it's for an elect it's for a chosen
[1:12:28] bride it's for an elect lady
[1:12:30] that I place within her a confidence
[1:12:36] don't tell everybody
[1:12:38] it's for ones I've called ones I've
[1:12:40] chosen
[1:12:43] he's given you that confidence he's
[1:12:46] given you that assurance
[1:12:51] you say brother James
[1:12:53] kind of stuff only happens in the Bible
[1:12:57] babies being raised from the dead and
[1:12:59] only in Jesus day and he all these
[1:13:02] different things but let me remind you
[1:13:04] of that little Mexican woman
[1:13:07] with a dead baby
[1:13:10] that was in your day
[1:13:14] that little Mexican baby
[1:13:16] had confidence that the doctors declared
[1:13:20] it dead at 10 A.M that morning
[1:13:22] of pneumonia
[1:13:24] now no matter what everybody else said
[1:13:29] this Mexican lady had a desire
[1:13:32] and was persistent
[1:13:34] and had confidence that if I can get to
[1:13:36] that man
[1:13:38] just like the same faith of that
[1:13:40] shunamite woman
[1:13:41] let's read it in perseverance doctors
[1:13:43] declared it dead at 10 A.M he says if
[1:13:47] God could Open the Eyes of a blind man
[1:13:49] he also give back a baby
[1:13:51] he's still the same God tonight friend
[1:13:55] you've got to be persistent to achieve
[1:13:57] something
[1:13:59] what if she would have would have
[1:14:01] listened and said well the baby is dead
[1:14:03] and just give up and go on you ever
[1:14:05] heard that before
[1:14:07] just give up and go on you'll never
[1:14:09] overcome you'll never get over that
[1:14:12] you'll never be victorious
[1:14:14] but listen it's the same God today
[1:14:20] well the baby is dead just give up and
[1:14:22] go on
[1:14:24] and see if that same faith that lived in
[1:14:26] the woman like the shinimite woman
[1:14:28] it still lives in people today once in a
[1:14:31] while they could strike that something
[1:14:34] not a put on not a make-believe but
[1:14:36] something real something that's genuine
[1:14:39] don't you think we can do that tonight
[1:14:44] he's the same God he's the same
[1:14:46] yesterday today and forever and she had
[1:14:49] that confidence that if I can get to the
[1:14:51] prophet of this hour
[1:14:53] my circumstances will change
[1:14:56] is that quiet confidence
[1:14:59] look at all the men
[1:15:01] Believers Christian men were stopping
[1:15:04] her to get to the prophet
[1:15:09] but yet she knew if I can get to him if
[1:15:13] I can see
[1:15:14] if I can get to that man
[1:15:16] he knows Jesus
[1:15:18] there's a Jesus inside him
[1:15:21] there's a confidence that she had
[1:15:29] now brother Branham he begins to talk
[1:15:31] here in this next quote and if I can
[1:15:34] just back it up
[1:15:37] that brother Branham begins to talk and
[1:15:39] he begins to talk about our Bible and
[1:15:41] how the confidence that we should have
[1:15:43] in it
[1:15:44] and he begins to tell the story about
[1:15:46] the this little stamp that a little boy
[1:15:48] had and he took it to the convenience
[1:15:51] store me many of you know the story and
[1:15:53] he took it to the convenience store and
[1:15:55] he wanted a an ice cream
[1:15:57] and he took this stamp and he traded
[1:15:59] this stamp in for an ice cream
[1:16:02] a little later that convenient sore men
[1:16:05] sold it for five hundred dollars
[1:16:07] later that stamp was sold for 2500.
[1:16:11] when the prophet said it in this sermon
[1:16:13] he was saying that that stamp is worth
[1:16:16] quarter of a million dollars
[1:16:18] and a boy traded an ice cream for it
[1:16:22] but yet it's just a piece of paper
[1:16:25] you see this is a piece of paper with a
[1:16:28] cover
[1:16:30] but the value isn't in this but it's
[1:16:34] what's written on the piece of paper
[1:16:39] there's hundreds of thousands of
[1:16:41] thousands of Bibles in the world
[1:16:44] it's a piece of paper yes we hold value
[1:16:46] to it but if you understand what I'm
[1:16:49] saying it's what's written on it
[1:16:52] is what brings its value what's written
[1:16:55] on it is the infallible word of Jesus
[1:16:57] Christ
[1:16:59] what's written on this
[1:17:03] is your ticket out of here
[1:17:07] it's more than just a book
[1:17:12] the value is placed on what's written
[1:17:15] and many people don't understand the
[1:17:17] value why
[1:17:19] because they don't understand what's
[1:17:20] written
[1:17:21] they can't read between the lines
[1:17:25] that's why they don't have confidence in
[1:17:27] it
[1:17:29] brother Branham says here Jesus of
[1:17:32] Nazareth passes by in 58 and he says so
[1:17:35] that's the way with it is with God
[1:17:38] if he made a promise he must keep that
[1:17:41] promise
[1:17:42] if he doesn't keep that promise then he
[1:17:44] isn't God
[1:17:47] and if a certain crisis arises and God
[1:17:49] acts on that crisis then
[1:17:51] he has to act the same the second time
[1:17:53] that he's act or he's acted the wrong
[1:17:55] way the first time
[1:17:57] if someone was sick and God was
[1:18:00] consulted and God healed that person
[1:18:02] then the second time
[1:18:04] someone gets sick
[1:18:06] and God is consulted and he's got to
[1:18:09] heal the the second time
[1:18:11] or he did wrong when he acted the first
[1:18:13] time
[1:18:14] he says for God is infinite
[1:18:18] God is infinite we are finite
[1:18:23] we get smarter Our Generations get
[1:18:25] brighter and more intelligent our
[1:18:27] scientists move on but God being
[1:18:29] infinite he has to be perfect all the
[1:18:32] time he cannot get smarter he cannot
[1:18:35] lose any of his intelligence he Remains
[1:18:38] the Same
[1:18:40] there's where our confidence can solely
[1:18:43] rest can rest solely upon what he says
[1:18:46] to be the truth if it isn't then I can't
[1:18:49] believe him
[1:18:53] and if this Bible doesn't if his
[1:18:55] promises he's made in this Bible is not
[1:18:59] true
[1:19:00] then it's not the Bible or there is no
[1:19:02] God
[1:19:03] but if the Bible's promises are true and
[1:19:05] God confirms him promises then he is God
[1:19:08] of the Bible
[1:19:10] which is his word just as plain as could
[1:19:14] be
[1:19:15] do you believe that musicians come
[1:19:19] you see our confidence can rest solely
[1:19:21] upon his word
[1:19:25] and we are just talking in the back room
[1:19:27] they didn't even know but this book is
[1:19:29] full of promises
[1:19:31] it's full of promises
[1:19:34] but you have to take him at his word
[1:19:36] his word said I'll be with you even in
[1:19:38] you
[1:19:43] his word says that all things are
[1:19:45] possible to them that believe do you
[1:19:48] believe tonight
[1:19:51] you see this is a book of promises it's
[1:19:53] not a hope so it's not a maybe or
[1:19:56] possibly
[1:20:00] but God is confident
[1:20:03] and I have this confidence
[1:20:07] amen he that began the work
[1:20:11] he that begin the work
[1:20:14] it's nothing I can do within myself it's
[1:20:17] nothing that you could do
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:22] but he that begin the work
[1:20:25] will finish it
[1:20:28] so what do you have to worry about
[1:20:29] tonight
[1:20:32] if your confidence lays in him what do
[1:20:34] you have to worry about
[1:20:39] it I'll ask you again
[1:20:42] what is your confidence live this
[1:20:43] evening
[1:20:48] he's the most important thing
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] the Lord is the confidence the Lord is
[1:21:00] my confidence
[1:21:03] in quietness
[1:21:06] and confidence
[1:21:08] shall be your strength
[1:21:10] you see when you're weak you're strong
[1:21:13] you
[1:21:14] try it when you begin to place your life
[1:21:17] into his hands
[1:21:20] when you begin to surrender
[1:21:22] not my will but your will
[1:21:26] you know the hardest thing is giving up
[1:21:29] your will
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:33] when you give somebody complete
[1:21:34] confidence you have no control over it
[1:21:41] but I can say
[1:21:43] that I have full confidence in Jesus
[1:21:46] Christ
[1:21:47] who has called us who has elected us
[1:21:52] let us stand
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:01] let's just pray
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:09] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:22:13] Lord we're so thankful
[1:22:17] Lord we're so thankful for your word and
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:24] thought that you placed upon our hearts
[1:22:27] we ask that it would be an encouragement
[1:22:28] that the people would see that a quiet
[1:22:31] confidence it's not a boasting it's not
[1:22:33] an arrogant it's not a look at me or
[1:22:36] what I can do for Jesus Christ but Lord
[1:22:38] when we begin to get ourselves out of
[1:22:40] the way you can use us
[1:22:44] father you're still the same yesterday
[1:22:46] today and forever

[1:23:12] so thankful

[1:23:20] Lord I just ask that you would just be
[1:23:22] with your people as they go
[1:23:25] may they have encouragement
[1:23:28] may they be uplifted maybe there's some
[1:23:30] backward ones that have low uh
[1:23:32] self-esteem or not very confident within
[1:23:35] themselves and but father may you give
[1:23:37] them that confidence
[1:23:40] Lord if the world can try to push being
[1:23:43] confident in who they are Lord how much
[1:23:45] more should we as the body of believers
[1:23:48] who have a promise
[1:23:49] who have an assurance
[1:23:53] Lord let us
[1:23:56] rest in the promises of your word and
