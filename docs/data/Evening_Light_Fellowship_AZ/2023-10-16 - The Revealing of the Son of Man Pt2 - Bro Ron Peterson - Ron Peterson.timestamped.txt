[35:28] yeah brother Bram love to come to Uganda
[35:32] and Kenya and
[35:34] Tanzania but that was his desire but
[35:37] there was a war that was going on
[35:39] between the the the Mau he couldn't come
[35:43] but the message came and reached to Us
[35:46] Praise the Lord and that message is life
[35:49] to
[35:50] us yeah that's why when it came to us we
[35:53] loved it we entered into it and we are
[35:56] hold holding upon it and you know that
[35:58] everything that we need to make it in
[36:01] the Rapture is already given to us in
[36:03] the message of the hour we are just
[36:06] resting upon it and that's our
[36:09] Assurance yeah as Judas said in Judah 3
[36:16] Judah is the last book of the second
[36:19] last book it's next to Revelation says
[36:22] when I give diligence to write to you I
[36:25] wrot to you that you may obtain for the
[36:27] faith that was delivered to the Saints
[36:30] yeah so this faith brother Bram was sent
[36:34] to restore us back that faith and that's
[36:37] the faith we we are containing
[36:39] for yeah in the message the perfect
[36:42] Faith he said the bride has to reach
[36:44] into that perfect faith when you read
[36:47] the scripture in Marco uh
[36:50] 1122 have the faith of God I say when we
[36:54] reach that that that stage
[36:57] we shall be the bride
[36:59] material and I want to tell you today
[37:01] I'm looking at the bride material we are
[37:04] the purest of the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:06] I know that very soon we are going to
[37:08] make it into the Rapture because the
[37:11] word of God has already identified us
[37:14] and we are identified with the word the
[37:16] message of this hour we are seeing
[37:18] events made clear by prophecy when you
[37:21] look at what's happened to Israel that's
[37:24] the natural church but we are a
[37:25] spiritual church
[37:27] we know that our time of going home is
[37:30] closer it's more than uh than we think
[37:34] anytime something can happen that's why
[37:38] Paul says in first 1 Corinthians 15
[37:41] verse 51 says I show you a mystery we
[37:44] shall not die but we shall we shall not
[37:47] all die but we shall be changed in the
[37:49] twinkle of an eye it will be so speed
[37:51] like that so any time because no one
[37:54] knows the day the time but we know the
[37:57] season because we are seeing the events
[37:59] we are seeing the bath pain happening
[38:02] all over you see if you are Eyes Are
[38:05] Open you can see the bath pain happening
[38:08] these things happening land sliding
[38:11] water over flowing sickness coming like
[38:15] coid 19 all those are birth pain why the
[38:20] the world is is is crying for new
[38:22] release is crying for the manifestation
[38:23] of the sons of God and we are the
[38:26] manifestation sons of God so may God

[46:35] nights are just very very hard for so
[46:37] many people because of work and and

[46:42] day why it's dedicated to the
[46:45] Lord so I'm sure I'm not going to be
[46:48] breaking into your sporting and all of
[46:50] the different things that you need to do
[46:52] cuz we don't do that on Sunday anyway we
[46:54] keep it holy into to the Lord and so

[57:47] 29 and 30 but the same day that lot went
[57:51] out of Sodom it rained fire and
[57:53] brimstone from heaven
[57:55] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[57:59] it be in the day when the son of man is
[58:03] revealed turn back with me into the Book
[58:06] of Matthew Matthew chapter
[58:09] 18 and verse
[58:12] 11 Matthew 18
[58:23] verse1
[58:25] for the son of
[58:27] man is come to
[58:30] save that which was
[58:32] losten there is a mission there is a
[58:35] reason there was a purpose yes and he
[58:38] says I keep came to seek and to save
[58:40] that which was lost Luke chapter 19 if
[58:44] you would back to
[58:48] Luke 19 veres
[58:53] 9-10 Jesus having spoke to n
[58:58] Nicodemus and told him to come down out
[59:00] of the sycamore tree this day I've got
[59:02] to have lunch with you at your home
[59:06] verse 9 and Jesus said unto him this day
[59:09] is
[59:09] salvation come to this house for as
[59:13] much as he also is a son of Abraham he
[59:16] was identified as Seed of Abraham I'm
[59:20] sure zakus is going oh wow how does he
[59:23] know me and the verse 10 says for the
[59:26] son of man has come to seek and to save
[59:29] that which was lost may God bless the
[59:32] reading of his word you may be seated
[59:34] this morning in the presence of God Amen
[59:37] I would like to continue on there is
[59:40] this is such a vast subject that really
[59:43] as I got into it and as you know as a
[59:46] minister as you begin to study the word
[59:47] of God it begins to unfold and it just
[59:50] goes from one scripture to this to
[59:52] another thought and that and you just
[59:55] next thing I know I have 17 pages of
[59:58] notes where normally I have 10 to 12 I
[1:00:01] will see how far I go on that if I can
[1:00:04] I'll try to finish it all but if we
[1:00:07] can't that's no problem we'll have some
[1:00:09] left over for another time now I would
[1:00:12] like to continue on the subject of the
[1:00:14] revealing of the son of man this is part
[1:00:17] two and I want to take a a a subject
[1:00:21] here of the change of ministry and a
[1:00:24] change
[1:00:25] of administration you will find out that
[1:00:27] every time that God has a
[1:00:30] minister or a prophet upon the age or
[1:00:34] upon the scene you will find out that
[1:00:36] there is a certain Ministry that he has
[1:00:40] and God is with that Ministry and you'll
[1:00:42] find out that that M Ministry even
[1:00:44] within itself changes amen it goes
[1:00:48] brother brms actually says that every
[1:00:50] great prophetic Ministry has three polls
[1:00:53] it has a first poll a second second pull
[1:00:55] and a third pull so we understand that
[1:00:58] there is a Ministry and how there's a
[1:01:00] change in the ministry and when you have
[1:01:02] a change of ministry you have a change
[1:01:05] of the way it's
[1:01:08] administered so I want to take some of
[1:01:11] this and I want to parallel for just a
[1:01:14] moment because it would it would be
[1:01:17] foolish of us to not mention some of the
[1:01:21] things that's happening in the world
[1:01:23] today right now with Israel why because
[1:01:26] the prophet of God said the very same
[1:01:29] hour that the angel of God met me the
[1:01:32] very same day the very same hour that he
[1:01:35] sent me with this message he said Israel
[1:01:37] became a nation he said behold the Fig
[1:01:40] Tree and he says watch if your
[1:01:43] understanding you'll catch that all of
[1:01:45] this is connected together Israel and
[1:01:48] the church as it was in the first Exodus
[1:01:51] it'll be in another Exodus even in this
[1:01:53] our day
[1:01:56] so we understand even all of the global
[1:01:59] leaders now we're talking the natural
[1:02:01] right
[1:02:02] now global leaders are very
[1:02:04] concerned people are ambassadors are
[1:02:07] flying going from one country to
[1:02:10] another and Muslim leaders are rising up
[1:02:14] causing uh the
[1:02:17] Muslim Believers or religion to unite
[1:02:22] together in fact the leader of that
[1:02:25] Muslim movement said we are wanting the
[1:02:29] world to see the power of
[1:02:33] Islam Benjamin Netanyahu had a rebuttal
[1:02:38] of that he says you can come against us
[1:02:42] with spear and sword you can do what you
[1:02:45] want but we come to you in the name of
[1:02:47] the god of Israel amen we know that what
[1:02:51] is happening in Israel isn't an atrocity
[1:02:55] it is
[1:02:57] horrible and I want you to understand
[1:02:59] that this is the part of the flashing
[1:03:02] red lights of his coming we know that
[1:03:06] Christ is coming he's coming very soon
[1:03:09] the Bible says I just throw a couple
[1:03:11] scriptures out here for you to make you
[1:03:13] aware of what's Happening Luke 21 verses
[1:03:17] 20 through
[1:03:18] 32 and when you shall see Jerusalem
[1:03:21] compassed with armies how many of you
[1:03:23] know they've actually Compass them in
[1:03:25] from north south east
[1:03:27] west compass with armies then know that
[1:03:30] the Desolation thereof is nigh then let
[1:03:34] them which are in Judea flee to the
[1:03:36] mountains let them which are in the
[1:03:38] midst of it depart let not them which
[1:03:40] are in the countries enter there into we
[1:03:43] can see that scenario playing right now
[1:03:47] right for these be the days of
[1:03:50] Vengeance that all things which are
[1:03:52] written may be fulfilled
[1:03:54] but woe unto them that are with child to
[1:03:57] them that give suck in those days for
[1:04:00] there shall be G great distress in the
[1:04:02] land and wrath upon this people and they
[1:04:06] shall fall by the edge of the sword and
[1:04:08] they shall be led away captive into all
[1:04:10] nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten
[1:04:13] down of the Gentiles until the times of
[1:04:17] the Gentiles be fulfilled so it says
[1:04:19] Jerusalem is going to be a Troublesome
[1:04:22] Stone people that handle it the Bible
[1:04:24] says this is going to be an area that
[1:04:26] people are going to have a problem with
[1:04:29] Jerusalem and so it's a uh it's going to
[1:04:32] be h a Troublesome Stone it's going to
[1:04:35] be a hot potato if you please until the
[1:04:39] times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so
[1:04:42] watch the connection there's Gentiles
[1:04:46] and Jews and we're understanding that
[1:04:48] God is going to deal with the Gentiles
[1:04:51] for a period of time he calls that the
[1:04:54] times of the
[1:04:56] Gentiles and there shall be signs in the
[1:04:59] Sun and in the moon and in the stars and
[1:05:03] upon the Earth distress of nations with
[1:05:06] perplexity and the Sea and the waves
[1:05:09] roaring men's Hearts failing for
[1:05:11] fear and look and looking for after
[1:05:14] those things which are coming on the
[1:05:15] earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[1:05:18] shaken then you then shall they see the
[1:05:22] son of man coming in a cloud with power
[1:05:24] and great Glory can you say Amen with
[1:05:26] that amen when these things begin to
[1:05:29] come to pass then look up and lift up
[1:05:33] your heads for your Redemption draweth

[1:05:40] things which he

[1:05:51] small piece of land called is Israel

[1:06:08] say unto you the Gen this generation
[1:06:10] shall not pass away till all be
[1:06:13] fulfilled picking it up also in Acts
[1:06:15] chapter 2 the Bible
[1:06:17] says verse 16 but this is that which was
[1:06:22] spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:06:25] it shall come to pass in the last days
[1:06:26] saith God I will pour out of my spirit
[1:06:30] upon All Flesh your sons and your
[1:06:33] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[1:06:36] men shall see visions and your old men
[1:06:38] shall dream dreams and on my servants
[1:06:41] and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
[1:06:43] those days of my spirit and they shall
[1:06:47] prophesy I will show wonders in Heaven
[1:06:51] above and signs in the Earth beneath
[1:06:55] blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the
[1:06:59] sun shall be turned into darkness and
[1:07:02] the moon into blood before the great and
[1:07:06] notable day of the Lord come and it
[1:07:09] shall come to pass it whosoever shall
[1:07:12] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[1:07:15] saved my brother my sister we are in the
[1:07:18] midst of perilous times a time of
[1:07:21] trouble the world is perplexed T the of
[1:07:25] a small country Israel why in the world
[1:07:30] would there be such an uprising to want
[1:07:33] to destroy a people that for thousands
[1:07:38] of years they've been persecuted they've
[1:07:40] been killed they've been gassed they've
[1:07:43] done all these things to try to
[1:07:46] eradicate the children of Abraham but
[1:07:49] you know what God is with
[1:07:51] them God is watching over them
[1:07:54] signs of the times are all around us
[1:07:56] Wars rumors and
[1:07:58] Wars Israel is at War at this very
[1:08:02] moment Ishmael is attacking
[1:08:05] Isaac they are of the seed Ishmael of
[1:08:08] the Seed of Abraham through
[1:08:12] Hagar you all know that according to
[1:08:14] scripture and ishmail hated Isaac and
[1:08:18] persecuted
[1:08:21] Isaac the and I told you here just a
[1:08:24] couple weeks ago I said watch things
[1:08:27] happened to Israel on feast day and here
[1:08:30] 50 years ago on the same day yam Kapur
[1:08:35] the day of atonement the most holy feast
[1:08:38] day of all the feasts of Israel there
[1:08:43] the the uh Arabs attacked Israel 50
[1:08:46] years ago they called it the yam Kapur
[1:08:49] War what do they call it now yam Kapur
[1:08:51] War part two I don't know
[1:08:54] but it's
[1:08:55] continuing
[1:08:59] because just as it's been from the very
[1:09:02] beginning Satan does not want to see the
[1:09:06] Seed of Abraham come to fruition but God
[1:09:11] Is Watching Over Israel I tell you my
[1:09:14] brother my sister the whole world right
[1:09:17] now is got their eyes on Israel now
[1:09:21] watch this because do you think it just
[1:09:24] was coincidence that it happened on the
[1:09:27] day of yam Kapur do you think it was
[1:09:30] coincidence that yesterday how many know
[1:09:32] that we had a solar eclipse how many of
[1:09:36] you even walked outside or perhaps even
[1:09:38] looked at it or took a picture you'll
[1:09:40] find out the Bible says and the sun
[1:09:43] shall be darkened the moon shall turn to
[1:09:45] blood we have seen all of these Blood
[1:09:48] Moons we have seen the the eclipses all
[1:09:52] of that now the prophet of God God when
[1:09:54] he was here he he began to take notice
[1:09:57] of these he said they're signs the Bible
[1:09:59] says let the sun and the Stars let them
[1:10:03] be for times and for Seasons I want you
[1:10:06] to understand God is showing you timing
[1:10:09] and Israel brother Brenham said is God's
[1:10:11] time piece so we want to see what's
[1:10:14] happening with Israel it's a Time piece
[1:10:16] could it be that the countdown has
[1:10:18] already begun could it be that this
[1:10:21] partial eclipse of the Sun watch this
[1:10:24] it's amazing because there was a partial
[1:10:27] eclipse and it caused a ring of
[1:10:30] fire
[1:10:32] Hallelujah but there's coming another
[1:10:34] one in 2024 April the 8th that is going
[1:10:39] to be a total eclipse of the Sun not a
[1:10:42] partial this was a partial and they will
[1:10:45] have the sun will be blotted out by the
[1:10:47] moon and when it does it will not have a
[1:10:50] ring of fire because the the this
[1:10:53] eclipse of the moon will be 112 miles
[1:10:56] closer to the Earth and it will cover
[1:10:58] the the sun and it will have a
[1:11:01] Corona it will have a like a Halo
[1:11:04] completely around it I'm wondering have
[1:11:08] we entered into the time where in the
[1:11:11] church is trying to eclipse the light of
[1:11:15] God In This Very hour and yet God is
[1:11:18] fixing to Crown
[1:11:20] it Hallelujah signs
[1:11:24] of the times are everywhere brother
[1:11:26] Brandon picks it up a lot of you see in
[1:11:27] church age follow along Matthew
[1:11:30] 24 mention signs in the heavens
[1:11:33] concerning this last day just before
[1:11:36] Jesus comes I wonder if you notice such
[1:11:39] a sign recently fulfilled as to portray
[1:11:42] the very truth that we've been
[1:11:46] discussing that truth is that Jesus has
[1:11:48] been steadily pushed aside until the
[1:11:51] last age he has pushed outside the
[1:11:55] church and he goes on I'm going to just
[1:11:58] read the highlighted portion now think
[1:12:00] on this the church
[1:12:02] shines in the reflected Light of Christ
[1:12:05] he is the sun the church is the moon so
[1:12:10] we're seeing sun and moon we're seeing
[1:12:12] Christ in the church something's
[1:12:15] happening thus this orb of light is the
[1:12:18] Moon it had decreased from almost a full
[1:12:21] moon in the first age to a silver in the
[1:12:24] fourth age but in the fifth age he began
[1:12:26] to grow in the sixth age it took a great
[1:12:28] step of growth forward in part of the
[1:12:31] 7eventh age it was still growing when
[1:12:33] suddenly it stopped short and waned to
[1:12:36] almost a nothingness so that instead of
[1:12:40] light it was the Blackness of
[1:12:43] apostasy and at the end of the age it
[1:12:46] had ceased to shine for that Darkness
[1:12:48] had taken over I tell you what just look
[1:12:51] at the world condition now look at the
[1:12:54] minds of people they don't know a man
[1:12:56] from a
[1:12:58] woman I'm telling you they are turned
[1:13:00] over to reprobate Minds to a time of
[1:13:05] deception
[1:13:08] M that's gross Darkness the
[1:13:11] people Christ is now outside the church
[1:13:15] here's the sign in the sky the last
[1:13:18] eclipse of the moon was a total
[1:13:21] eclipse he says and when he went to
[1:13:24] Jerusalem speaking of the Pope the moon
[1:13:27] or the church went into total darkness
[1:13:31] this is it this is the end this
[1:13:35] generation shall not pass away until all
[1:13:38] be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come
[1:13:41] quickly what you saw
[1:13:43] yesterday is just for telling you that
[1:13:47] things are happening these things don't
[1:13:50] happen just by coincidence it happens
[1:13:53] for a purpose it's showing to you I'm
[1:13:56] coming I'm coming here's the flashing
[1:13:59] red light you see the blood moons you
[1:14:02] see the sun being darkened you see on
[1:14:04] feast days hallelujah what is God doing
[1:14:08] getting our attention but there was a
[1:14:10] greater sign than all of that there was
[1:14:13] a voice sent in this day behold I will
[1:14:16] send you Elijah the prophet and he shall
[1:14:20] prophesy and he shall finish the
[1:14:22] mysteries of God hallelujah it'll be the
[1:14:26] mystery being finished that the Bible
[1:14:28] says down Through the
[1:14:30] Ages that's been hid but what is it it's
[1:14:35] Christ in you the hope of glory showing
[1:14:39] the very mystery that's being finished
[1:14:41] you have a part of it Hallelujah you are
[1:14:45] part of a prophetic word that's being
[1:14:47] finished in this very hour Hallelujah
[1:14:50] somebody say Amen to that he didn't come
[1:14:52] here to tell you how to go to church how
[1:14:55] to pay your tith or how to dress that's
[1:14:58] all a part of it but he taught you how
[1:15:01] that you might have a union that you
[1:15:04] might be having an invisible Union with
[1:15:06] Christ and Christ is the word that's why
[1:15:10] he came back to restore the
[1:15:13] word not some denomination not some
[1:15:16] man's idea but the word back to the word
[1:15:20] here's God's umum Thumb you want to know
[1:15:22] what's truth God's word is
[1:15:25] [Applause]
[1:15:27] true somebody give him praise this
[1:15:31] [Applause]

[1:15:39] news Muslim nations are being rallied
[1:15:43] right now against
[1:15:46] Israel it's very important to understand
[1:15:48] that the prophets identified
[1:15:51] pre-tribulation spirits during the
[1:15:53] second world war he said watch
[1:15:57] Hitler Stalin and musolini are pre
[1:16:01] tribulation Spirits he said they are

[1:16:51] crematorium it was a death camp
[1:16:54] why
[1:16:56] pre-tribulation let me tell you that
[1:16:58] same spirits of Hitler Stalin and

[1:17:08] the atrocities that they'll do to women
[1:17:10] and children are

[1:17:18] conscience do this to little children to
[1:17:21] women to yes

[1:17:28] people brother Brenham

[1:17:34] me he said any man without the spirit of
[1:17:37] Christ is nothing but a brute beast
[1:17:40] that's right and he says who will ravish
[1:17:42] the women take the little child cut it
[1:17:45] out of the mother bash its head against
[1:17:47] the wall oh my and he says watch
[1:17:51] pre-tribulation spirit this same MOS
[1:17:54] Hezbollah and Isis that's rallying
[1:17:58] together right now guess guess who
[1:18:00] they're going to kill remember
[1:18:02] Revelations 11 has two witnesses coming
[1:18:05] down Moses and Elijah and guess what
[1:18:07] they're going to do they're going to
[1:18:08] kill them also remember they're going to
[1:18:11] call plagues and things huh and then
[1:18:14] they're going to kill them and their
[1:18:16] bodies are going to lay there in
[1:18:18] Jerusalem for 3 days and then God will
[1:18:20] raise them up but also the 44,000 the
[1:18:24] true Jew huh the true Jews out 12,000
[1:18:28] out of every tribe that's what your
[1:18:30] Bible says 144,000 you know what they're

[1:18:35] Martyr them who's going to do it Hamas
[1:18:38] Isis hollah and there's going to be a
[1:18:40] mark of the beast let me tell you when
[1:18:42] this pale horse rider begins to ride
[1:18:46] death and Hell follow him but praise God
[1:18:49] there's going to be a Rapture of the
[1:18:51] Bride there's going to be a catching a
[1:18:53] way before that happens
[1:18:56] hallelujah or how would you even want to
[1:18:58] bring children into this world knowing
[1:19:01] what's coming on the face of the Earth
[1:19:04] thank God we got a promise thank God we
[1:19:06] got blood thank you we got a t token
[1:19:10] that is over
[1:19:14] us God help me to speak this
[1:19:21] morning
[1:19:28] there's going to be a change of
[1:19:31] ministry and a change of
[1:19:34] administration because we see the
[1:19:36] Gentile days is just about
[1:19:41] over Gentiles days are numbered amen he
[1:19:46] said when the Gentile day of
[1:19:47] dispensation is closed there'll not be
[1:19:50] another Gentile saved and guess what
[1:19:52] God's going to do he's going to
[1:19:54] fix it all and go back to the
[1:19:57] Jews
[1:19:59] huh
[1:20:01] wow now watch this because we see it in
[1:20:04] the scriptures remember Jesus said go
[1:20:07] not on all the world he said I want you
[1:20:11] to go first to the house of Israel how
[1:20:13] many know he said that go first to the
[1:20:16] house of Israel and so they go and guess
[1:20:19] what they do they rejected him God
[1:20:23] who
[1:20:24] was omnipotent and merciful knew he
[1:20:28] blinded his own children yes he blinded
[1:20:32] their eyes otherwise they would have
[1:20:34] seen their Messiah but they crucified
[1:20:37] him why because he had to be crucified
[1:20:41] he was kinsman redeemer he had to come
[1:20:44] and pay the price do you understand
[1:20:50] that watch the change now in Acts
[1:20:53] chapter
[1:20:55] 13 Paul being the first church age
[1:20:59] messenger verse 45 but when the Jews saw
[1:21:02] the
[1:21:03] multitudes they were filled with envy
[1:21:06] and spake against those things which
[1:21:08] were spoken by Paul contradicting and
[1:21:12] blaspheming then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[1:21:15] bold and said it's necessary that the
[1:21:18] word of God should first be spoken to
[1:21:20] you but see you put it from me you judge
[1:21:24] yourselves Unworthy of an everlasting
[1:21:26] life Lo we turn and go to the Gentiles
[1:21:30] so there's a Time the ministry is
[1:21:33] changing we went first to Israel you
[1:21:35] rejected I'm changing the ministry I'm
[1:21:38] changing now the administration I'm
[1:21:41] going from Jew to Gentile are you
[1:21:44] following
[1:21:47] that so we see the pattern happening
[1:21:50] again
[1:21:51] today
[1:21:53] Gentiles have rejected the word of God
[1:21:57] and their eyes have been
[1:22:00] blinded the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[1:22:03] Chapter 4 verses 3 and
[1:22:07] 4 but if our gospel be hid it's hid to
[1:22:10] them that are
[1:22:11] lost look at that if our gospel be hid
[1:22:16] it's hid to them that are
[1:22:18] lost in whom the God of this world have
[1:22:23] blinded the
[1:22:24] minds of them which believe not well I
[1:22:27] don't believe you can't believe but if
[1:22:30] you are a seed of
[1:22:33] God you can't help but
[1:22:36] believe nobody talks you into it and
[1:22:39] nobody talks you out of it
[1:22:44] Hallelujah whom the God of this world
[1:22:47] has blinded their
[1:22:49] minds of them which believe not lest the
[1:22:53] light of the Glorious gospel of Christ
[1:22:55] who is the image of God should shine
[1:22:57] unto
[1:22:58] them the prophet of God came down in our
[1:23:01] day and he said guess what 1956 the
[1:23:04] church came to a place called kades
[1:23:10] Baria and he says and they rejected the
[1:23:13] gospel the Full Gospel businessman the
[1:23:17] Pentecostal Church those that God was
[1:23:20] shining the light to they rejected the
[1:23:23] word and he says kabot is written on the
[1:23:28] wall Judgment of God is now striking
[1:23:32] America as much as I don't like it as
[1:23:35] much as you'd like to raise up somebody
[1:23:37] and and put somebody back in office the
[1:23:40] prophet of God said you could put a
[1:23:42] Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington
[1:23:44] in every office he said it's too late
[1:23:48] she's already turned oh my we see
[1:23:51] America going so
[1:23:53] radical that even parents parents you
[1:23:56] that are watching over your children you
[1:23:59] that the ones God is given as your
[1:24:01] inheritance you're labeled a
