[9:15] with Stephen, if you would count.
[9:21] Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father,
[9:23] we approach you tonight in the
[9:25] allsufficient name of Jesus Christ,
[9:27] knowing Lord that in that name all
[9:30] things are possible. Father, even a
[9:33] layoff of a thousand people, but yet you
[9:36] have seed there, Lord, that you knew
[9:39] would need that job. So, Father, you are
[9:42] all sufficient, all knowing, Lord. you
[9:45] know our needs before we even ask of

[9:56] that we can call upon your name in times
[9:59] of trouble. And we ask this evening,
[10:01] Lord, that by the foolishness of
[10:03] preaching, Lord, that you would come our
[10:06] way and that you would speak to our
[10:07] hearts. Father, there's one thing that
[10:10] we are in need of, and that is more of
[10:12] thee. More of thy revelation, Lord, that
[10:15] we might know how to stand and overcome
[10:18] in this evil day. Lord, bless your
[10:21] people this evening. Bless brother Ron
[10:23] as he comes and ministers the word.
[10:25] Lord, may may the thought be transferred
[10:27] to our hearts is our desire. We love
[10:30] you. We thank you, Father, for all the
[10:33] unspoken needs, Lord, that's upon the
[10:35] hearts of your people. We bring them
[10:37] before you and may they go before you as
[10:39] a sweet smelling savor, Lord. And may we
[10:42] be in a expectation, Lord, Father, that
[10:46] you might come and meet our needs
[10:48] according to your will. We ask these
[10:50] favors now in the name of Jesus Christ.

[29:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Revelation 2:es 1-7.
[29:15] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus,
[29:17] right?
[29:19] These things saith he that holdeth the
[29:21] seven stars in his right hand, who
[29:23] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[29:26] candlesticks.
[29:28] I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy
[29:31] patience, and how thou canst not bear
[29:34] with them which are evil, and thou hast
[29:36] tried them which say, They are apostles,
[29:39] and are not, and hast found them liars,
[29:43] hast borne, and hath patience, and for
[29:46] my name's sake hast labored, and hast
[29:48] not fainted. Nevertheless,
[29:51] I have somewhat against thee, because
[29:54] thou hast left thy first love. Remember
[29:57] therefore from whence thou art fallen.
[29:59] Repent and do the first works, or else I
[30:02] will come unto thee quickly, and will
[30:04] remove thy candlestick out of his place,
[30:08] except thou repent.
[30:10] But this thou hast,
[30:13] that thou hatest the deeds of the
[30:15] niclatans,
[30:17] which I also hate.
[30:20] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[30:22] the spirit saith unto the churches. And
[30:25] to him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[30:28] will I give to eat of the tree of life
[30:31] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[30:34] God.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Reh excuse me. 2 Timothy 3:es
[30:41] 1-1 17.
[30:46] 2 Timothy 3:es
[30:49] 1-17.
[30:57] This know also that in the last days
[30:59] perilous time shall come. For men shall
[31:02] be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
[31:07] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[31:11] disobedient to parents,
[31:14] unthankful,
[31:15] unholy,
[31:17] without natural affection,
[31:19] truce breakers, false accusers,
[31:23] incontinent,
[31:25] fierce, despisers of those that are
[31:28] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[31:31] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[31:34] God, having a form of godliness, but
[31:37] denying the power thereof, from such
[31:40] turn away.
[31:42] For of this sort are they which creep
[31:44] into houses and lead captive silly women
[31:47] laden with sins, led away with divers
[31:50] lust, ever learning and never able to
[31:54] come to the knowledge of the truth.
[31:57] Now as Janice and Jabres withstood
[32:00] Moses, so do these also resist the
[32:03] truth. Men of corrupt minds, reprobate
[32:06] concerning the faith.
[32:09] But they shall proceed no further. For
[32:12] their folly shall be made shall be made,
[32:14] excuse me, shall be manifest unto all
[32:17] men as theirs also was. Amen.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; But thou hast fully known my doctrine,
[32:23] manner of life, purpose, faith,
[32:26] longsuffering, charity, patience,
[32:28] persecutions, afflictions which came
[32:31] unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at
[32:34] Lystra. What persecutions I endured, but
[32:38] out of them all the Lord delivered me.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; We can all say amen to that because
[32:45] &gt;&gt; it's happened to us, too.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:49] And all that will live godly in Christ
[32:52] Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[32:56] But evil men and seducers shall wax
[32:58] worse and worse, deceiving and being
[33:01] deceived.
[33:03] But continue thou in things which thou
[33:05] hast learned, and hast been assured of,
[33:08] knowing of whom thou hast learned them,
[33:12] and that from a child thou hast known
[33:14] the holy scriptures, which are able to
[33:16] make thee wise unto salvation through
[33:18] faith, which is in Christ Jesus.
[33:22] All scripture is given by inspiration of
[33:26] God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
[33:30] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[33:33] in righteousness, that the man of God
[33:36] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[33:38] unto all good works.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And the church of the living God said,
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You all may be
[33:46] seated this evening in the presence of
[33:49] the Lord. Amen.
[33:52] Amen. This side's a little bit full over
[33:54] here. We got a couple pews that are kind
[33:56] of really lightly. I think we're going
[33:57] to have to move everybody from the back
[33:59] forward.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I praise the Lord
[34:04] for those that are here and those that
[34:06] aren't. We praise the Lord also
[34:11] because all things work together for the
[34:13] good.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; God knows why.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'd like to uh take a thought
[34:19] that my wife and I have been going
[34:23] through in our morning devotions. We
[34:26] read the Bible together and then after
[34:28] we get done reading the Bible, then we
[34:29] go into the seven church age book. And I
[34:32] want to say that the seven church age
[34:34] book has really really just been such a
[34:38] blessing to us as we read it. We read a
[34:41] couple pages, but as we read, you'll
[34:43] find out that nearly every sentence is
[34:46] powerp packed.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; It's just so full and it's so directed.
[34:52] And yet, uh there are different ones
[34:55] throughout the message that have said uh
[34:59] things against the seven church age book
[35:01] and said that it's not brother
[35:03] Brandham's book because we all know that
[35:05] brother Lee Vale had compiled. Uh if any
[35:09] of you
[35:12] know that the seven church age book,
[35:15] the seven church age book is compiled
[35:19] from the revelation of Jesus Christ
[35:21] series. Here is the seven church ages
[35:24] preached.
[35:26] So what brother Brandham wanted to do
[35:28] was to have this condensed down and put
[35:31] into book form
[35:33] and to so that people can read it and
[35:36] look at the a little bit of the history
[35:38] of it. And so from the revelation of
[35:41] Jesus Christ, it took a I I don't know,
[35:45] I want to say about a year and a half or
[35:47] a couple years uh because uh Brother
[35:50] Brennan preaches this these sermons from
[35:54] December 4th, 1960.
[35:58] He starts
[35:59] uh June the 18th, goes through to June
[36:02] the 18th of 1961.
[36:06] So the seven church age book did not get
[36:08] printed until the late of 1965.
[36:13] And so he preaches this and it takes
[36:15] from a time of 1960
[36:18] and he preaches this to 61
[36:22] and then it's got to be compiled,
[36:25] proofread, corrected and everything and
[36:28] then put into a book form and then
[36:30] printed. And so it came out to the
[36:32] public in 1965.
[36:35] I would like to title my sermon tonight
[36:38] from a thought that we got from the
[36:40] seven church age book and I was entitled
[36:43] from fire
[36:45] unto form.
[36:48] And I want you to think about this
[36:50] because you if you allow the revival
[36:54] fire that is within this message to die
[36:58] down, you will become formal.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Cold,
[37:04] &gt;&gt; powerless.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; You just have a form of godliness.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; And it'll just be a religion. God help
[37:12] us. I don't want to have just a
[37:14] religion. Religion is a covering.
[37:17] So uh
[37:20] also I thought because it's been such a
[37:23] blessing to Sandy and I that I thought
[37:26] you know what I would like to take two
[37:28] Sundays a month uh of an evening service
[37:32] for those this is uh just for free will
[37:36] those who would like to come and study
[37:38] the seven church age book together and
[37:42] have some Bible study go through the
[37:44] seven church age book and just We
[37:46] probably won't even do it in the
[37:48] sanctuary. I don't know how many unless
[37:50] all of you show up. Then then we'd we'd
[37:52] have to come in here. But um uh we'll
[37:56] probably do it in the senior Sunday
[37:58] school room over here. And we will have
[38:01] a time where we just kind of have a a
[38:04] together time to go through Bible study
[38:07] and to go through the seven church age
[38:09] book and we have questions and answers
[38:11] as we go along. I love to have a running
[38:14] dialogue. I love to have where we sit
[38:17] and we read this and then I ask you a
[38:19] question. Well, why do you think he said
[38:20] that? Have you answer back and we just
[38:23] kind of we have a little roundhouse
[38:25] discussion because so much of the time
[38:27] the ministering of the word is one-sided
[38:30] &gt;&gt; from me to you and there's no uh talking
[38:33] back. Uh I don't want you to talk back
[38:35] but I just you know I'm saying no
[38:37] reciprocation. You see so we we have to
[38:40] make that clear. But anyway, uh so
[38:43] [clears throat] there is if I was to be
[38:46] given
[38:48] a single book that I could take with me
[38:51] to go anywhere in the world and you help
[38:53] start a church and get get people
[38:56] founded in the message,
[38:57] &gt;&gt; it would be the seven church age book.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Because here within the seven church age
[39:02] book lies every major doctrine that he
[39:05] preaches. everything from the Godhead,
[39:07] water baptism, the history of the
[39:10] church, nickelan spirit, um, uh, mystery
[39:14] Babylon, it just goes on and on. And,
[39:17] uh, so, uh, anyway, it is also a book
[39:23] that is has been attacked,
[39:26] um, quite a bit throughout the the years
[39:30] um, and has become controversial.
[39:34] And I remember now this is the uh this
[39:38] is my personal testimony
[39:41] when I forget what year it was. I do
[39:44] have it documented. I have it on video.
[39:47] Um I videoed all the meetings. It was
[39:50] minister meetings with brother Francois
[39:52] Alipicard in Loausanne Switzerland. So
[39:55] we had ministers from all over Europe. I
[39:57] had brother Perry Green. I invited
[39:59] brother Perry to come. So he told me he
[40:02] was coming. And then Ewel Frank uh from
[40:05] uh there in uh in Germany he came also.
[40:09] So, we had two seasoned elders, icons of
[40:13] the message, and these two brethren
[40:15] showed up, and there was probably 35, 40
[40:17] ministers throughout Europe. And uh I
[40:21] went ahead and videoed this. And during
[40:23] the course of conversation and uh the
[40:27] time of the meetings, brother Perry
[40:29] Green got up and he said something that
[40:31] caused all the the men to kind of gasp
[40:34] and he said uh well concerning the seven
[40:37] church age book. He said, "Brother
[40:39] Brennham, talk to me about burning it."
[40:41] And everybody went like, "Wow." And
[40:45] there wasn't really a lot of explanation
[40:47] about it and everything. And so when uh
[40:50] the service was done and I had uh picked
[40:54] brother Perry Green up at Zurich,
[40:56] Switzerland and brought him to the
[40:57] meetings and then uh every day going
[41:00] back and forth from the meetings uh I
[41:02] would pick him up from the motel and
[41:03] bring him to the meetings. But when we
[41:06] left that night, I said, "Brother
[41:07] Perry," I said, "You said something and
[41:10] you didn't elaborate on this, and I want
[41:12] you to tell me very, very clearly what
[41:16] it was that you discussed about, Brother
[41:19] Brennan, uh, that to burn the seven
[41:23] church age book." He said, well, he
[41:25] said, "Brother Ron, I was the first one
[41:27] to take up an offering to give to
[41:29] brother Brennham to go ahead and get
[41:31] this book printed and I help organize,
[41:34] etc., etc. And I don't remember all of
[41:36] the details, but he was quite involved
[41:38] with getting this church age book uh
[41:41] printed.
[41:43] And so I said, "Well, please tell me
[41:45] what was it that you talked about why
[41:48] perhaps the book uh should be burned?"
[41:50] And he said, "Uh, well, I asked Brother
[41:53] Brennham, you you've got now your copy
[41:55] of the Seven Church Age book. You've
[41:57] read it." And actually, Brother Brennan
[41:59] preferred that his daughter Rebecca
[42:01] actually read it to him. So he would
[42:03] sit, Rebecca would read it and
[42:06] everything. And u he made a comment to
[42:08] brother Perry. He says, "Well, uh he
[42:11] says, uh, brother Green, uh, when people
[42:15] read the seven church age book, there
[42:18] will be things in there that's a little
[42:20] bit more intellectual
[42:22] than my way of speaking." He uses words
[42:26] in the Seven Church Age book that
[42:27] Brother Brennham never says in any of
[42:30] all of his sermons.
[42:31] And I'm going to give you some examples
[42:33] of that so you would know. Well, brother
[42:36] Perry says, "Oh my, well, if you're not
[42:38] ex if you're not 100% happy with it,
[42:41] we'll burn it."
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Now, that's all that he he he said. And
[42:46] uh, of course, Brother Bram said, "No,
[42:49] no. Uh, you know, I took it before the
[42:51] Lord and after all this time and effort
[42:54] that's been put into it." And he said
[42:56] another thing and and I don't know if
[42:58] any of you have ever noticed this but as
[43:01] you go into the seven church age book
[43:03] and of course you got the opening page
[43:05] there with the title and you've got a
[43:07] picture of brother Brennham.
[43:09] Now, if you turn the page,
[43:12] you have the seven church ages, the
[43:14] seven golden candlesticks, the stars.
[43:17] But if you go back to and turn it back
[43:19] here, you'll see,
[43:21] and you can't write see it really from
[43:24] where you're at, but one of the stars
[43:28] from the the page behind it
[43:32] goes right to the center of brother
[43:34] Bram's forehead.
[43:36] So, there's a star in the center of his
[43:38] forehead. And brother Brandham said,
[43:39] "Did you notice that?" He says, "Well,
[43:41] brother, uh, uh, you know, uh, Brother
[43:45] Brandham, if if you don't like it, we'll
[43:46] just He said, "No, that was for a
[43:48] purpose."
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He said, "No, that was
[43:51] for a purpose." Even God lets all things
[43:54] work together for his good. That's
[43:56] right. And so anyway, um
[44:01] so he says, "No, I have uh even sought
[44:04] the Lord on this and I was told to go
[44:08] ahead, the Lord gave me permission to go
[44:10] ahead and take these books and I think
[44:13] if I'm I may stand corrected, the first
[44:16] 100 copies of the seven church age book,
[44:19] Brother Brenham signed each copy and
[44:21] gave them to ministers at first to go
[44:24] ahead and just give it to them. Then
[44:25] later when they got the the bigger
[44:27] shipments uh they gave them out to all
[44:29] the people. So uh uh
[44:36] I must admit that there are some things
[44:39] and the way they're written in the seven
[44:41] church age book that can cause confusion
[44:46] because of the way that it's formatted
[44:48] or the way that it's compiled.
[44:51] And there are several things within that
[44:55] uh that even as uh brother Mario and I
[44:59] were over there in uh Manila,
[45:02] Philippines, and we were talking
[45:04] concerning the new birth of being born
[45:07] again where you're a new creature in
[45:09] Christ Jesus. You're born a babe in
[45:11] Christ, water, blood, spirit. Okay? And
[45:14] then you grow and come to the time of
[45:17] adoption. Okay? Uh and uh so uh as we
[45:22] were kind of going over those things,
[45:24] one of the brothers there says, "Oh no,
[45:26] the new birth and the baptism of the
[45:29] Holy Spirit are one and the same."
[45:30] Brother Brandham said so. And I said,
[45:32] "Yes, sir. I know that seven church age
[45:34] book." I said, "But you got to keep
[45:36] reading." And it was kind of funny
[45:38] because the theme when we got done with
[45:40] our questions and answers and the time
[45:42] with the ministers, uh they got the
[45:45] idea. I said, "Keep reading."
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said that's one thing about this
[45:49] unfolding word. I said if you look at
[45:51] brother Bram's message and you take it
[45:54] in its entirety many times he will say
[45:57] something uh that if it's isolated it
[46:01] may look like something's wrong and
[46:03] there may be a controversy or a
[46:06] contradiction.
[46:08] And remember whenever the Bible or the
[46:11] message looks like it contradicts itself
[46:14] there's one thing that we're lacking and
[46:16] that's revelation.
[46:17] Because Matthew 28:19, baptizing them in
[46:20] the name of father, son, and holy ghost
[46:23] and then Acts 2:38
[46:26] when it's baptized in the name of Jesus
[46:28] Christ uh looks like it's contradicting.
[46:32] But the only reason that something will
[46:34] look contradictory is because we lack
[46:37] revelation.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; So that's what we need more than
[46:40] anything is revelation. So you keep
[46:42] reading. Now if you understand how many
[46:45] of you know that the unfolding of the
[46:48] revelation of God came to brother
[46:50] Brennham and kept unfolding.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; He said many people put a period with a
[46:56] certain thought or a doctrine and say
[46:58] God and it stops right there. He said
[47:00] don't do that. He said put a comma
[47:03] because God will add to your revelation.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; And so we all know and I I shared this
[47:09] with the the brethren there in the
[47:11] Philippines. I said if you all um go
[47:14] back and listen to the early tapes and
[47:16] brother Brennham in the sermon he
[47:18] preaches this several times called the
[47:20] mighty conqueror and he says we all know
[47:23] who that white horse rider is. It's
[47:25] Christ riding down through the ages.
[47:28] And then with the opening of the first
[47:30] seal he says oh my I was a 100 miles
[47:33] from the truth. I went back into my old
[47:36] notes and was started looking over what
[47:38] different theologians and ones had said.
[47:41] And of course, you all know I preached
[47:43] the seven uh seals in about 20 minutes
[47:47] way back. And he said, "I was far from
[47:50] the truth." And so when uh the
[47:54] revelation comes to him, and I've always
[47:57] told you this, and this is to to my
[48:00] church here, God circumcised this
[48:03] message from understanding carnal
[48:07] knowledge of men and brought to us the
[48:11] clarity of the word of God. And thus
[48:13] saith the Lord,
[48:15] &gt;&gt; he circumcised this message from 63 on
[48:18] with the seals. Not that 47 to 63 is
[48:23] bad. No. No. Because there are certain
[48:27] things that he teaches all the way from
[48:29] 47 through to 65 that is the same. He
[48:32] doesn't change on that.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And so we thank God for those those
[48:37] older sermons. I love them. I I love to
[48:39] to listen though. And I must admit that
[48:43] a real revelation of this message came
[48:46] to me when I was over in Europe from 84
[48:50] to 89 and we had started with the spoken
[48:53] word office and then it went to Voice of
[48:55] God recording and I was able to have all
[48:58] of the tapes. I don't know if any of you
[49:00] remember but you used to get some box of
[49:02] tapes where you'd order from Voice of
[49:05] God and when you paid for those they
[49:07] sent you another pack. Do you remember
[49:09] that? Well, hey, you know, working
[49:12] construction and and and everything, we
[49:15] didn't have a whole lot of money extra
[49:17] to be able to spend for a lot of tapes
[49:19] and everything, and I would be envious
[49:21] of of anybody that had such a large
[49:24] supply of tapes. And so anyway, uh we
[49:28] didn't have a whole lot of tapes. So
[49:30] when I got over there in Europe and and
[49:32] we got our first full
[49:35] complete set of tapes, I started
[49:37] listening to this message of the hour
[49:40] chronologically.
[49:42] Go back and let us listen to 47, 48, 49,
[49:45] 50, 51. And you begin to see how God is
[49:49] dealing with the prophet. Brother
[49:51] Brennan was just coming into his own
[49:53] understanding about his own ministry.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is dealing with him, showing
[49:58] him visions and all of this stuff. And
[50:00] and back in uh uh the early 50s when
[50:04] brother Brennan preaches a sermon, I
[50:06] think it's 1956, what is a vision? The
[50:08] first time he he uh is told about
[50:11] there's three pulls, first, second, and
[50:13] third pull. And about fishing in the,
[50:16] you know, the the fish being caught with
[50:18] a little lure and then the baby shoe and
[50:20] all of that. Now, remember, all of those
[50:22] things were symbols. Yeah. And brother
[50:24] Brandham did not understand these things
[50:27] until it began to unfold to him. Okay?
[50:31] So when you understand that this
[50:33] revelation is still unfolding,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; you will have a great understanding
[50:40] yourself because you know what? God is
[50:42] still even though the prophet preached
[50:45] these things and our last tape is 1965,
[50:49] it's still unfolding. Why? It's
[50:51] unfolding in us. Hallelujah.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; We're catching things now that we never
[50:56] caught.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just give you a couple
[51:02] examples
[51:04] so that you'll get a uh a greater
[51:07] understanding of what I mean when
[51:10] intellectual wording in the seven church
[51:12] age book. So, in the seven church age
[51:15] book, I I gave some quotes to the
[51:18] brethren here. Um this is in the sourian
[51:21] church age. uh page 1442. Now let me
[51:26] stop and clarify something.
[51:29] The
[51:31] pages and quoting from the seven church
[51:34] age book from the original book
[51:37] doesn't line up with David Momus's
[51:41] because he went ahead and did his own
[51:43] formatting. And the reason he did his
[51:46] own formatting was so that there would
[51:48] be no copyright infringement.
[51:51] So even when he was told to cease and
[51:54] desist in in doing his books and putting
[52:00] them out, although it wasn't his book as
[52:02] he was compiling the sermons together.
[52:04] In fact, uh I'm so thankful that he put
[52:08] them in chronological order. And so if
[52:12] any of you have ever seen brother David
[52:15] Momus's book uh books and how he
[52:19] compiled them together. So people that
[52:22] want to study it, if they study just by
[52:26] his and page and paragraph, others that
[52:29] have it on the original,
[52:32] it doesn't line up.
[52:35] And so then you have to go to the quote.
[52:37] Well, which quote do you go to? So what
[52:40] I do is I study from voice of God
[52:43] recordings uh the table or folio views
[52:47] however way that you but you have it on
[52:49] the computer and you can look at it and
[52:51] even as brother Ruben Tamson had told me
[52:54] here a few months ago he said brother
[52:55] Ron uh you quoted from a sermon that
[52:58] brother Brandman never preached he said
[53:01] I I couldn't find the sermon title I
[53:03] said well listen I said you you have to
[53:05] understand many of the sermon titles
[53:09] that was given in the early books. And
[53:12] I've got some of the original um
[53:15] realtore tapes as an example the great
[53:19] harlot. If any of you have ever heard
[53:22] reference to the sermon called the great
[53:24] harlot. Well, actually that's not what
[53:27] he titled it. He titled it why we are
[53:30] not a denomination.
[53:32] And so uh you know it may look as though
[53:36] it's a little contradictory or
[53:37] something. knows many of the sermons. So
[53:40] when Joseph Brandham took over Voice of
[53:42] God, he corrected everything back to the
[53:45] original titles. He said, Brother Bram
[53:48] said, "Well, I'm preaching on uh tonight
[53:52] uh Revelation chapter 13. I'll be
[53:54] talking about the great harlot and
[53:56] everything, but the title is why I'm
[53:58] against organized religion." And and
[54:00] brother Brandham is actually identifying
[54:02] and I want all of you to understand
[54:04] this. The reason that we know that
[54:06] denomination is wrong
[54:10] is because brother Brennham takes it
[54:12] back to its origin.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Why we are not a denomination
[54:17] &gt;&gt; and what is wrong with those that
[54:21] are in denomination? Brother Bram said
[54:24] that is a spirit of organization.
[54:27] And he says, "And the devil is coming in
[54:29] there and he has deceived them by
[54:32] changing, adding to, taking away, and
[54:34] deviating from the word."
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And so I want to show you. And then also
[54:40] to even add a little more confusion,
[54:43] brother George Smith went ahead and had
[54:45] had the seven church age book printed
[54:48] again, put it in a leather bound, and
[54:51] then he put it in different paragraphing
[54:53] and paging also. So I started Sandy and
[54:58] I are right now in our morning devotions
[55:00] reading from brother George's
[55:02] seven church age book and Stephen
[55:05] McNeely was asking me brother Ron I'd
[55:07] like to see some of your old books that
[55:09] you've got all marked up and everything
[55:11] and I says well just open it up and
[55:13] you'll see uh in fact this is my
[55:15] original seven church age uh book and
[55:19] I've just got so many notes and
[55:20] different things in it and I wore it out
[55:22] and pages started falling apart that
[55:24] brother Wes Nygard and some brethren uh
[55:27] when we were back on the church in
[55:29] Maryland, they went ahead and said,
[55:30] "Brother Ron, I see your seven church
[55:32] age book is falling apart." And they had
[55:34] it rebound for me and even put my name
[55:36] on it. And so, uh, instead of having to
[55:40] use the one that I had all marked up, I
[55:43] started going through another one of the
[55:46] seven churches book and now I'm marking
[55:48] it all up, right? And uh it's just
[55:52] amazing how much you glean
[55:55] &gt;&gt; from this when you take your time and
[55:56] you look at it.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. I tell you what, for brother
[56:00] Brennham having a seventh grade
[56:01] education,
[56:04] the knowledge that he had of the word of
[56:06] God is is astounding.
[56:09] Anyway to show you an example of uh we
[56:14] talk about in intellectual wording that
[56:16] brother Bram said well when people will
[56:19] look at this they will see that you know
[56:21] I I I don't preach like this as an
[56:23] example smrnian church age uh paragraph
[56:26] 144. Yeah there we go. Um now before we
[56:30] leave this subject I want to make myself
[56:32] very clear on what is the ba baptism of
[56:35] the holy ghost is according to the word
[56:38] it is not according to me it's not
[56:40] according to you it's according to thus
[56:42] sayaith the lord or we are falsely led
[56:47] understand that brother said false
[56:49] prophets bring false births
[56:53] &gt;&gt; they birth you to a sensation or to an
[56:56] emotion but not to the word that's
[56:58] That's why brother Bram said, "Look, I'm
[57:00] taking you a a prophet of God always
[57:02] takes you back to the word of God, back
[57:04] to thus sayeth the Lord." Okay, let's
[57:07] read on. To begin with, you'll notice
[57:09] that in my meetings when I have finished
[57:11] preaching an evangelistic service or
[57:13] some teaching message, I cast a netit
[57:16] and invite a response from the people. I
[57:19] ask them to come forward and receive the
[57:20] Holy Spirit. My Pentecostal friends
[57:24] upon hearing me say this believe that
[57:27] I'm on I'm I'm inviting people to come
[57:30] forward to be baptized with the Holy
[57:32] Ghost because they're already born
[57:33] again. So when I invite those who are
[57:36] spirit uh led filled excuse spiritfilled
[57:40] to come and deal with those who have
[57:44] answered the invitation to receive the
[57:46] spirit. These dear ones surge forward
[57:48] and deal with the people in such a
[57:50] manner as to encourage them to yield to
[57:52] God and believe to speak in tongues. Now
[57:56] hang on there a second. Brother Brennham
[57:59] is having to correct the people even
[58:01] within his own congregation.
[58:04] He says why? Because they came out of
[58:06] that denomination but didn't some of
[58:09] them brought their old denominational
[58:11] thinking and understanding with them.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they would say, "Okay,
[58:15] we're you're inviting people to come
[58:17] forward and we're going to pray for them
[58:19] until they speak in tongues." This has
[58:22] caused a great deal of confusion. And I
[58:24] want to tell you exactly what I mean. I
[58:27] mean for the sinner to come forward and
[58:29] to be born again, which is to be
[58:30] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[58:33] Holy Ghost, which is exactly what took
[58:35] place at Pentecost when the church was
[58:38] launched. In other words, to be born of
[58:41] the spirit is to be truly baptized with
[58:43] the Holy Ghost. It is one and the same.
[58:47] Now, if you stop there, that's
[58:51] confusing.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[58:55] And this is where the brother in the
[58:58] Philippines, oh, Brother Bram said,
[58:59] "It's one and the same." I said, "Yes,
[59:02] sir, but keep reading." So, let's just
[59:03] keep reading. Now, I realize it's going
[59:06] to be confusing for a moment here as
[59:08] most people know that I was ordained a
[59:10] Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly
[59:13] declared that the Baptists have missed
[59:16] it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost
[59:18] when you believe for that is not so. You
[59:20] receive him since you believe. Acts
[59:23] 19:es 2-6, he said unto them, "Have you
[59:26] received the Holy Ghost since you
[59:28] believe?" And they said unto him,
[59:30] um, we have not so much as heard whether
[59:32] there be any in Holy Ghost. He said unto
[59:35] them, unto what were you baptized? And
[59:37] they said, unto John's baptism. Then
[59:40] said Paul, John verily baptized with the
[59:42] baptism of repentance unto the people,
[59:46] that they should believe on him which
[59:47] should come here after him, that is on
[59:51] Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they
[59:53] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[59:55] Jesus. When Paul laid his hands upon
[59:57] them, the Holy Ghost came upon them and
[1:00:00] they spake with tongues and prophesied.
[1:00:02] There it is. Paul said, "Have you
[1:00:04] received since, not when you believe?"
[1:00:07] There is a great difference there. For
[1:00:09] it is after we believe that we receive.
[1:00:13] Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word repeat
[1:00:16] of what happened at Ephesus according to
[1:00:20] Acts 19. in whom you also trusted after.
[1:00:24] Now, Brother Brandon, capitalize that
[1:00:26] after there, that you heard the word of
[1:00:28] truth, the gospel of your salvation, in
[1:00:31] whom also after that you believe, not
[1:00:34] when you believe, you were sealed with
[1:00:36] the Holy Spirit of promise.
[1:00:39] Now, here is my point.
[1:00:42] Too many of our modernists and even our
[1:00:44] fundamentalists so-called believe under
[1:00:47] salvation at a certain specific time in
[1:00:50] many cases is making a decision
[1:00:54] and that has been called receiving
[1:00:56] Christ or being born again.
[1:00:59] Now again here if you stop at certain
[1:01:03] quotes you're going to get confused.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Now to receive Christ is to receive his
[1:01:08] spirit. To receive his spirit is to be
[1:01:11] born again. to receive his spirit is to
[1:01:12] be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:01:17] These folks
[1:01:20] believe.
[1:01:24] Hey, these folks believe.
[1:01:30] He's quoting them.
[1:01:33] Do you understand? It's how you read it,
[1:01:35] man. Any of you that went to school and
[1:01:39] you had to go through and look at your
[1:01:42] studies, you have to know how this man's
[1:01:44] writing and what he's referring to.
[1:01:47] Okay,
[1:01:50] that is wonderful. BUT THEY STOP THERE.
[1:01:52] YOU RECEIVE the Holy Ghost after you
[1:01:54] believe. It's always been that way and
[1:01:56] always will be. The very first word of
[1:01:58] direction to the people was by Peter at
[1:02:00] Pentecost. Repent. Be baptized every one
[1:02:03] of you in the name of Christ. uh uh
[1:02:05] Jesus Christ. So listen, that is not the
[1:02:10] prophet's doctrinal teaching. If you
[1:02:13] were to take those quotes, look, he said
[1:02:16] it, seven church age book, one and the
[1:02:18] same, Holy Spirit, new birth, and then
[1:02:21] he repeats it again just a few verses
[1:02:25] later. And again, that has caused such
[1:02:28] confusion because people stop there.
[1:02:32] And as I told those brethren, keep
[1:02:33] reading.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; That didn't stump me. I was so glad and
[1:02:38] I thank God. I I believe that we should
[1:02:40] have the message in our heart, not in
[1:02:42] our heads.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. That listen, pretty soon, you
[1:02:46] know, brother Brennham's doctrinal
[1:02:48] teaching and a certain quote when
[1:02:52] somebody say says something like that
[1:02:54] doesn't stump you. I said, "Yes, sir.
[1:02:56] You're exactly right. Seven church age
[1:02:58] book." I said, 'If we had the book here
[1:03:00] right now, I said, 'I'd read it for you.
[1:03:02] I says, Brother Ram said, that's what
[1:03:03] these people believe. Here are the
[1:03:05] modernists and the fundamentals. This is
[1:03:07] what they believe. Now, let me tell you
[1:03:10] what I believe. Okay? I said, you just
[1:03:13] got to keep reading.
[1:03:16] So
[1:03:19] you have to understand that some message
[1:03:21] preachers are trying to prove their
[1:03:23] personal doctrinal teachings by bringing
[1:03:27] their former teaching from Pentecost
[1:03:31] even into this message.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; And so what they do is they start
[1:03:36] influencing the people
[1:03:39] of what they believe is the new birth
[1:03:42] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:03:45] now we're trying to bring to the
[1:03:47] people's understanding some kind of
[1:03:50] evidence. Now the reason that Pentecost
[1:03:54] early Pentecost when we talk about uh
[1:03:57] 1906 Pentecost not Acts 238 but when the
[1:04:01] Holy Spirit came down Acts uh excuse me
[1:04:04] of Pentecost 1906
[1:04:07] uh it was
[1:04:10] the Holy Spirit coming down and
[1:04:13] activating gifts and my it was it was a
[1:04:16] wild movement that went very very
[1:04:18] quickly and swept through the people and
[1:04:21] people were just it was a real revival.
[1:04:25] And brother Brennham said, "Now listen,"
[1:04:29] he said, "watch, if we if this same
[1:04:33] thing were to continue on," he said, "50
[1:04:37] years,
[1:04:39] they would be further away from the
[1:04:41] truth than it it took the Catholic
[1:04:45] Church 2,000 years."
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And you think, "Well, how can that be?"
[1:04:51] When you think about Ephesus, when Sandy
[1:04:53] and I have been reading, and it starts
[1:04:55] out in the book of Ephesians, what's
[1:04:57] wrong with the Ephesian church? The
[1:05:00] Ephesian church had the most people that
[1:05:03] witnessed either the disciples and them
[1:05:06] preaching
[1:05:08] or got to hear and see the ministry of
[1:05:11] Christ himself.
[1:05:14] Got to experience
[1:05:17] the upper room experience.
[1:05:20] They were moved on by God. And just a
[1:05:23] few later, few years later,
[1:05:27] God has to diagnose them and say,
[1:05:30] "You've left your first love." How could
[1:05:32] you do it? How could you let these false
[1:05:35] preachers and different ones come in
[1:05:36] here and take you all already away from
[1:05:39] your first love?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; My
[1:05:44] Okay, so let's go. I'm going to go to
[1:05:47] another one. Page 164.
[1:05:54] of
[1:05:56] this original seven church age book.
[1:06:01] He says, and I didn't give this to the
[1:06:03] brethren here just because I knew it'd
[1:06:05] be too much reading. Now, uh remember
[1:06:07] now John the Baptist was both prophet
[1:06:10] and messenger of his day. He was filled
[1:06:12] with the Holy Ghost from his mother's
[1:06:13] womb. When he was baptizing in Jordan,
[1:06:16] the word of God Jesus came to him. The
[1:06:19] word always comes through the spirit
[1:06:21] filled. That is the evidence of being
[1:06:23] filled with the Holy Ghost. Now, this is
[1:06:25] amazing because brother Brenammy uses
[1:06:28] the word the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:30] about eight or 10 times here in the next
[1:06:33] two or three pages. You want to know
[1:06:34] what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is?
[1:06:36] He tells you,
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; "Keep reading."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. Keep reading.
[1:06:50] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:06:51] cannot receive.
[1:06:54] He says, I want you to note very
[1:06:57] carefully that Jesus did not say that
[1:06:59] the evidence being baptized with the
[1:07:01] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues or
[1:07:03] interpreting, prophesying or shouting
[1:07:06] and dancing. He said the evidence would
[1:07:09] be that you would be in the truth. You
[1:07:11] would be in the word for your age.
[1:07:13] Evidence has to do with receiving the
[1:07:16] word.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Evidence has to do with receiving the
[1:07:23] word. How many of you can say, "I've
[1:07:25] received it." Praise God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's evidence God's dealing with you.
[1:07:30] Let's keep reading.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; What came the word of God out from you
[1:07:35] or came it unto you only? The evidence
[1:07:37] of a spiritfilled Christian believer is
[1:07:40] not to produce the truth word, but to
[1:07:42] receive the word and believe it and obey
[1:07:45] it.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; The time of of all of these debating and
[1:07:53] different things. It's over.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I I don't want to debate the word. I
[1:07:58] don't mind sitting down questions and
[1:07:59] answers. I think, saints of God, what we
[1:08:03] have come to in this age is the
[1:08:05] maturity. We're not debating the word
[1:08:07] anymore. Come, let us reason together.
[1:08:09] You come with the right attitude because
[1:08:11] if you're not careful, you've got your
[1:08:13] idea and his idea and all you're trying
[1:08:16] to do is prove your point, not listening
[1:08:18] to his point.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] So,
[1:08:34] um,
[1:08:37] again, here's another example
[1:08:40] of some intellectualism
[1:08:44] put into the seven church age book that
[1:08:46] he uses certain words that he never in
[1:08:48] 1100 sermons never uses the words. So,
[1:08:53] they're kind of intellectual words. Here
[1:08:56] it is. Sardisian church age page 254.
[1:09:00] If there was a time of denominational
[1:09:02] zeal,
[1:09:04] it was at this tragic time. The words of
[1:09:07] Cornelius describe much of this area.
[1:09:11] Comminius, I'm sorry, Comminius wrote
[1:09:14] the one thing needful. He compares the
[1:09:18] world to a labyrinth.
[1:09:22] What's a labyrinth,
[1:09:25] Jonathan? Come on, Google it.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hey, Siri, what is the labyrinth?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Or how do you say it?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Labyrinth.
[1:09:35] What's a labyrinth? Google, hey, put it
[1:09:38] in your index of the messages. He He
[1:09:41] never uses the word. Never. and 1100
[1:09:45] sermons and shows the way out by leaving
[1:09:48] what is needless and choosing the one
[1:09:50] thing needful Christ. He goes on
[1:09:53] and now to the next out of the Bible
[1:09:56] they they forg their different creeds.
[1:10:00] These are their fortresses and bull
[1:10:02] works.
[1:10:04] Bull works. Brother Brenham in 1100
[1:10:07] sermons never uses the name bull works
[1:10:11] behind which they entrench themselves
[1:10:13] and resist all attacks.
[1:10:16] Now just a paragraph below that Satan is
[1:10:20] the greatest sopist
[1:10:23] 1100 sermons brother Rem never uses the
[1:10:25] word sopist. You know what a sophist is?
[1:10:29] Somebody who loves to debate. Any of you
[1:10:32] ever have debate in high school where
[1:10:34] you're on a debate team and they give
[1:10:37] you a subject and they say, "Okay, you
[1:10:39] be the you um we're just going to have
[1:10:42] you go on this side for let's say
[1:10:45] abortion and you're against abortion.
[1:10:47] Let's just have a debate on it just off
[1:10:50] the cuff and you have to debate one
[1:10:52] another over a certain subject." Well,
[1:10:54] Satan is the world's greatest sophist.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; He's a big debater. But type that in
[1:11:00] your message church. You'll he never
[1:11:03] says it in 1100 sermons. So there's
[1:11:05] where brother Brennan had told Perry
[1:11:08] Green. He said, "Brother Perry, some of
[1:11:10] these words and stuff, they'll see it.
[1:11:12] It's kind of intellectual." Okay. And so
[1:11:16] anyway, I just wanted to show you some
[1:11:18] of those things to kind of give you an
[1:11:20] example of why Brother Bram said, "Well,
[1:11:24] when some of the people read that book,
[1:11:26] they'll see that someone with a seventh
[1:11:28] grade education doesn't come up." And
[1:11:31] I've never spoke like those words. Okay,
[1:11:34] understand that. And I love that. And I
[1:11:37] love Brother Brandham's uneducated way.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] as one brother had told me there uh in
[1:11:44] uh he was a professor of English at ex
[1:11:50] uh university and he said brother
[1:11:54] Brennham butchered
[1:11:56] the king the queen's English. I said
[1:11:59] yeah he sure did
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; go
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; he he butchered it. I said but he
[1:12:03] butchered it so nicely.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And I said but he didn't speak the
[1:12:08] queen's English. He spoke the king's
[1:12:11] English.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Now you see in Acts 4:13 the Bible says,
[1:12:17] "And when they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:12:19] and John and perceived that they were
[1:12:22] unlearned and ignorant men. God does not
[1:12:26] need your
[1:12:28] human ability." These were ignorant and
[1:12:31] unlearned men. Peter could not even
[1:12:33] write his name.
[1:12:35] They marveled and took knowledge of them
[1:12:38] that they had been with Jesus.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you there's one thing about
[1:12:42] brother Brennham
[1:12:45] in his uneducated way.
[1:12:51] And he says, you know, I I just felt so
[1:12:53] bad because here I am with such
[1:12:56] I have no education. And he felt bad
[1:12:59] standing around all these men with their
[1:13:01] DHDs and all of this stuff. And he says,
[1:13:04] "And I I just say hate and taint and
[1:13:07] fetch and tote and and everything." And
[1:13:10] God said, "I'm going to be with you."
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I love the
[1:13:15] way that Brother Bram preaches.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; I do. I I I love
[1:13:22] and how he even makes up words.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You know, many times when he first
[1:13:27] refers to being born again, he says,
[1:13:30] "Born." B O R N E D. born again. Huh? He
[1:13:35] many times he says he he mixes words and
[1:13:39] he makes up his own words.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, I love it.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; And um so anyway, it wasn't because of
[1:13:48] intellectual learning.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; What attracted us to to the prophet's
[1:13:52] message was because he made this Bible
[1:13:55] become alive.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; He took the mysteries of this and opened
[1:14:00] it up. everything from something so
[1:14:02] simple as water baptism. And I remember
[1:14:05] the first time I heard brother Brandon
[1:14:07] preach serpent seed. He said it wasn't
[1:14:10] an apple. He said apples do not produce
[1:14:14] children.
[1:14:16] He said why if so we ought to pass it or
[1:14:19] to that show people are naked we ought
[1:14:22] to need to pass the apples again. Right?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And then he says no it was a sex act.
[1:14:29] And I thought, what? Yeah. Look forth
[1:14:32] brought forth children. Are you not the
[1:14:34] fruit of your mother's womb on? And I
[1:14:37] thought, why didn't I think of that?
[1:14:40] It was so simple. It's like they just
[1:14:42] kind of slaps you in the forehead and
[1:14:43] you thought, why didn't I think of that?
[1:14:45] Why? Because you're not a messenger.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; No, God sent unto the messenger to the
[1:14:51] church of Lae the mystery of these
[1:14:54] things. In fact, brother Brennham had
[1:14:56] not one particular mystery that he had
[1:15:00] given him except for the FACT HE TOOK
[1:15:02] ALL OF THE LOOSE ends that the others
[1:15:06] went and they probed at. And if you have
[1:15:10] ever read Clarence Larkin's
[1:15:12] dispensational truths, there is some
[1:15:14] fantastic things in there.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brandon read it quite
[1:15:19] thoroughly.
[1:15:21] um they probed at it. But one thing that
[1:15:25] the prophet of God did
[1:15:27] is that he opened us the the seven
[1:15:30] seals.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And some have gone so far as to say only
[1:15:35] six seals because the seventh seal
[1:15:36] hasn't been revealed. And and now there
[1:15:39] even is a doctrine going around that
[1:15:40] there's two sets of seals, one on the
[1:15:42] inside, one on the backside, and on and
[1:15:45] so now really what's going on now is
[1:15:47] there's the revealing of the second set
[1:15:49] of seals and Hey, listen. Find me a
[1:15:53] quote where he said there's two sets of
[1:15:54] seals. No, it's hidden within, written
[1:15:58] within, and on the backside sealed with
[1:16:00] seven seals. So, I researched that uh
[1:16:03] throughout today, and I found out, hey,
[1:16:05] there is no two sets of seals, one set
[1:16:08] of seals. Brother Brennan was trying
[1:16:11] with carnal understanding to to to
[1:16:14] figure this all out. But when it his
[1:16:16] eyes were open to it, then the
[1:16:19] revelation of the seven seals came to
[1:16:20] him. And the seventh seal, let's make it
[1:16:22] quite simple. What is it? Seventh seal
[1:16:25] is Revelations 10:1-7. It's the coming
[1:16:28] of the Lord. It's the ministry of this
[1:16:30] end time.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And now we know what is it? It's his
[1:16:33] coming.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. It's
[1:16:36] getting ready. It's a shout, a voice, a
[1:16:39] trumpet. All of this has to do with the
[1:16:41] coming of the Lord. We know what the
[1:16:42] seventh seal is. It's his coming. Thank
[1:16:46] God. And we now we understand what that
[1:16:48] is. But he said there was two parts that
[1:16:51] I understood. But that last part was in
[1:16:53] an unknown tongue. And he says, I
[1:16:55] believe that will be revealed right at
[1:16:58] the time.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; So he said, don't try to figure it out.
[1:17:01] Don't try to spiritualize everything.
[1:17:04] Let it go. He said in questions and
[1:17:06] answers between the sixth and seventh
[1:17:09] seal, he said, now I know you're not
[1:17:10] catching it. You're not supposed to
[1:17:12] catch it right now. He said, "But
[1:17:14] whatever you do," and I think I've shown
[1:17:17] you in a study series where Brother Bram
[1:17:19] says three to five times, "Do not
[1:17:22] interpret this. Just leave it alone. God
[1:17:26] is his own interpreter." And you don't
[1:17:29] have to try to figure it all out. You
[1:17:31] don't have to put it all together. In
[1:17:33] fact, God is his own interpreter.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] Let me give you one more
[1:17:44] example of some intellectual teaching
[1:17:47] from the seven church age book that is
[1:17:49] definitely you'll not find in brother
[1:17:51] Brandham's 1100 sermons. This Ephesian
[1:17:54] church age page 77
[1:17:58] the order of temple service is also very
[1:18:00] revealing.
[1:18:02] There were first of all priests who were
[1:18:04] unix
[1:18:05] there are sterile priesthood pre-aged
[1:18:09] or preaged I don't even know how to say
[1:18:11] it the sterility of people who would
[1:18:14] drift from the word for a people who
[1:18:16] claim to know God apart from the word
[1:18:18] are barren of life as a sterile unit.
[1:18:23] Well, when you when you go to reading
[1:18:26] this, this is not how brother Brennham
[1:18:28] spoke
[1:18:30] the sterility of preceded. Oh, where'd
[1:18:34] he get this?
[1:18:36] So, Lee Vale went ahead because he was a
[1:18:38] doctor of divinity. He, you know, and he
[1:18:43] always called him Dr. Leeville. I had
[1:18:44] one brother said, "Yeah, I tell you a
[1:18:46] witch doctor is what he was." I said,
[1:18:48] "Oh, man. Come on. Quit. Why? Why do you
[1:18:50] got to throw uh stones at people, you
[1:18:53] know? And um brother Brennham loved
[1:18:56] brother veil. He did. He was thankful
[1:18:59] that brother Veil went ahead and helped
[1:19:01] him compile this. That was a great work.
[1:19:04] Now what can this mean but the day would
[1:19:07] come when the vested clergy by political
[1:19:10] maneuvering, state help and substitution
[1:19:13] of the word and spirit for creeds and
[1:19:15] dogmas and human leadership would
[1:19:17] enslave the lady until the late the
[1:19:19] leaders luxuriated
[1:19:21] in illgotten wealth and enjoyed their
[1:19:24] filthy uh pleasures and the poor people
[1:19:27] who were to be served according to God
[1:19:30] now became the servants.
[1:19:32] You see the these are these are how
[1:19:34] brother Brandham told brother Green
[1:19:38] this is not the way I connect this
[1:19:41] that's not my verbiage it's not how I
[1:19:43] say things
[1:19:45] brother Brandon was a typologist and so
[1:19:48] brother Brandon would look back in the
[1:19:50] Old Testament and see what God did back
[1:19:53] there and he says I can tell you what's
[1:19:56] going to happen now because what
[1:19:57] happened then because he said history
[1:19:59] keeps repeating itself
[1:20:03] And so he would call it types and
[1:20:05] shadows. He says, "As it was in the
[1:20:08] first Exodus, so shall it happen again."
[1:20:11] And he said, "With a prophetic leader,
[1:20:13] and as Janice and Jambre, and as
[1:20:16] Dayathan and Kora, and as Joshua raised
[1:20:20] up, and Caleb, and so on and so forth,
[1:20:22] brother Brennham always looked at the
[1:20:24] types and shadows."
[1:20:27] So, [clears throat]
[1:20:29] uh,
[1:20:31] I wanted to just share with you some of
[1:20:33] these things here tonight. And I know
[1:20:35] this was nothing big and and and great
[1:20:38] and everything. And quite honestly, last
[1:20:41] night I I I
[1:20:44] couldn't I couldn't sleep. I went to bed
[1:20:46] about 9:30, 10 o'clock, woke up at 1,
[1:20:48] and I just had I'm having a hard time
[1:20:51] sleeping right now. So, um, I'm a little
[1:20:54] bit tired.
[1:20:56] and tried putting something together
[1:20:58] tonight and everything. And uh when I
[1:21:01] shared this with Sandy and I, the thing
[1:21:04] her and I as we were reading this from
[1:21:06] the seven church age book and I said,
[1:21:08] I'm going to preach about from fire to
[1:21:12] form.
[1:21:14] If we're not careful and we allow this
[1:21:18] fire that's burning within us, this
[1:21:21] revival to burn down to nothing but a
[1:21:25] couple embers.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; What we will become is form and we will
[1:21:31] have a form of godliness.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And I've always said, Lord, don't let me
[1:21:36] do that.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Don't don't let me become some kind of
[1:21:39] lukewarm believer. Let me be on fire for
[1:21:42] you. Let me love you God with a ferancy.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you all so much and thank
[1:21:51] you for coming tonight. And uh uh I
[1:21:55] thought
[1:21:57] showing you some of these things of what
[1:22:00] brother Rim said in the seven church age
[1:22:02] book that those quotes on that the new
[1:22:05] birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:07] is one and the same. If you keep
[1:22:09] reading, Brother Bram said, "Now I will
[1:22:12] tell you what I believe is." He said,
[1:22:14] "Not what the modernists say, not what
[1:22:17] they say, not what my Pentecostal
[1:22:19] friends say." So then, Brother Brennham,
[1:22:21] the next three to five pages, he
[1:22:24] explains it, but it was so good. It
[1:22:27] wasn't not right, Brother Mario, when we
[1:22:30] had the the ministers meeting and it
[1:22:32] didn't fluster me, brother. He he really
[1:22:34] was quite adamant. No, what you're
[1:22:36] saying that is not what brother I said
[1:22:38] brother keep reading.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I said if we had the seven church age
[1:22:41] book here I says we just open it up and
[1:22:44] I show you right there where brother
[1:22:45] Brennham I said go look up the words
[1:22:47] modernists and fundamentalists. I said
[1:22:50] you'll come right up with this quote and
[1:22:52] I said uh he said that's what they say.
[1:22:58] But you see, if you read it and you stop
[1:22:59] there,
[1:23:01] you can come up with some kind of
[1:23:04] mysterious doctrine and bring it over
[1:23:07] from former teaching right on into this
[1:23:11] this hour that we're in right now. And
[1:23:13] saints of God, I am a firm believer we
[1:23:16] do not have to manufacture anything.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; We don't have to work anything up. We
[1:23:23] don't have to get sensational. We don't
[1:23:25] have to get emotional. Uh, brother
[1:23:28] Brennham many times he uses the word
[1:23:31] fantastics.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Instead of fanatical.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He said all of these fantastics that are
[1:23:37] going on and emotions and sensations.
[1:23:40] There's an example of he used the wrong
[1:23:43] word and everything. But if you
[1:23:45] understand what he was meaning to say,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; fanatical and fantastic. And one of the
[1:23:51] things that he said about with Luther,
[1:23:53] he said, you know, Luther contested the
[1:23:56] Catholic Church
[1:23:58] and he says the main thing that was most
[1:24:02] astounding
[1:24:03] was not that he contested the Catholic
[1:24:07] Church, but he kept his head above the
[1:24:10] fanaticism that followed his own
[1:24:13] ministry.
[1:24:14] Isn't that amazing?
[1:24:17] the fanaticism that and he says those
[1:24:19] that started the Protestant movement to
[1:24:22] protest the Catholic Church, they
[1:24:24] started going out and burning churches
[1:24:27] and killing people. He said this is not
[1:24:29] where we're to do or to just just say
[1:24:32] the just shall live by faith.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:38] So much of the time
[1:24:40] people want to manufacture something
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; and this is not a time where we have to
[1:24:46] say we need to go back to no Pentecost.
[1:24:51] Pentecost is an experience
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; and you all of you have got to have your
[1:24:57] own Pentecostal experience. That is a
[1:25:00] time wherein you have your Pentecost
[1:25:03] with God, your jubilee, your releasing,
[1:25:07] God giving you
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; his own life.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] We don't have to manufacture anything.
[1:25:17] When I look at the life of Abraham,
[1:25:19] musicians, if you come, I'm closing.
[1:25:22] When you look at the life of Abraham,
[1:25:24] you see
[1:25:26] 25 years before he was given the
[1:25:29] promise. He's going to have a promise
[1:25:30] seed. He's gonna have a son.
[1:25:34] And brother Brennham reenacts it. In
[1:25:36] fact, I heard it last night as I was
[1:25:38] listening to a tape. He said, "Sarah, do
[1:25:41] you feel any different?" "Nope." "Week
[1:25:45] later." "How about it, Sarah? You feel
[1:25:47] any different?" "Nope." "How?" He said,
[1:25:50] "About nine months later, don't you feel
[1:25:52] anything?" Nope. About 10 years goes by.
[1:25:55] Nope.
[1:25:57] 15, 20, 25.
[1:26:02] Nope.
[1:26:04] And he says, "And Abraham rejoiced
[1:26:06] within himself." He says, "Praise God.
[1:26:09] It's going to be a greater miracle
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; now than ever before." Because he was as
[1:26:14] good as dead and so was his wife. And it
[1:26:17] wasn't something that he had to work up.
[1:26:20] In fact, when he listened to his wife
[1:26:22] through carnal understanding
[1:26:25] to go into Hagar, it brought forth an
[1:26:27] Ishmael.
[1:26:29] If Ishmael was the seed of Abraham, the
[1:26:32] right seed in the wrong woman church
[1:26:36] will bring forth an Ishmael every time.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The right seed
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; in the wrong church
[1:26:46] woman will bring forth an Ishmael. And
[1:26:48] Ishmael
[1:26:50] persecuted the elect.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; That's why he says bride will not
[1:26:57] persecute bride.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; No. Hey, we might disagree. In fact,
[1:27:01] when we had with the the minister
[1:27:04] meetings over there,
[1:27:07] when we had the the banquet,
[1:27:11] I shared with them the quote where
[1:27:12] Brother Bram said, "Some say he's coming
[1:27:14] on a white horse, others say he's coming
[1:27:16] on a white cloud." He goes, "What
[1:27:18] difference does it make as long as we
[1:27:20] agree he's coming?"
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "Some of us have built our
[1:27:24] little doctrinal walls because we see it
[1:27:29] a certain way and somebody else sees it
[1:27:30] another way. That shouldn't stop our
[1:27:33] fellowship. In fact, the only way we can
[1:27:36] have true fellowship one with another is
[1:27:39] just say what he said. Not interpret
[1:27:41] what he said. Say what he said.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we have to agree.
[1:27:48] That's why he said, "Say what I say on
[1:27:50] those tapes. give back. That's why
[1:27:55] all of the believers that knew me from
[1:27:57] way way back
[1:27:59] there, even those over in Europe, I used
[1:28:03] to use this terminology all the time.
[1:28:05] You do your homework.
[1:28:10] I'd say you get into these messages.
[1:28:13] You listen to these tapes.
[1:28:16] each one of you, and I say this to all
[1:28:18] of my young men, young girls, and
[1:28:22] everything. If you don't have a seven
[1:28:25] church age book that is yours, you get
[1:28:27] one.
[1:28:29] We'll make sure you get your own seven
[1:28:31] church age book. Have your own seals.
[1:28:35] Do any of you know what the COOD book
[1:28:37] stands for? Cood. What is this?
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Conduct.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Order and doctrine.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Order and doctrine. What is the cood
[1:28:45] books? It's questions and answers all
[1:28:49] the way through. And there are so many
[1:28:52] answers
[1:28:55] to so many questions even that are
[1:28:57] coming up today and they don't even
[1:28:59] read.
[1:29:01] Keep reading. And did you know in your
[1:29:03] cood book, you can go back there in the
[1:29:05] back and you want to look at see what
[1:29:07] brother Brent says about uh foolish
[1:29:11] virgin or tribulation, you go back and
[1:29:13] it tells you go back and read the
[1:29:16] questions and then he gives the answers.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:29:21] I tell all of you do your homework
[1:29:25] so that you go and you study these
[1:29:27] things. Get into it just like your
[1:29:29] Bible. Don't read it one time and that's
[1:29:30] it and close it up. This Bible keeps
[1:29:34] unfolding and every time I read it,
[1:29:38] I see something new and I say I I say,
[1:29:41] "Father, about the time I think I really
[1:29:45] am catching a good grasp and I kind of
[1:29:47] know something, you open another door,
[1:29:49] then I realize I don't know nothing."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] Don't put a period, put a comma
[1:30:00] and keep reading. Do your homework,
[1:30:02] saints.
[1:30:05] Most of all, pray for the pray for the
[1:30:08] ministry.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:13] I never take it lightly to get behind
[1:30:16] this pulpit.
[1:30:20] I never do. I realize God will hold me
[1:30:23] responsible. He will not hold you
[1:30:25] responsible for me, but he'll hold me
[1:30:27] responsible for you. I've got to tell
[1:30:30] you the truth.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, help us that we hold on to
[1:30:36] everything that is true
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; and say all that he said. Amen. God
[1:30:40] bless you. Let's stand together.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord.
[1:30:54] Keep me [singing] true,
[1:30:57] Lord
[1:30:59] Jesus.
[1:31:00] Keep me true.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Keep me true,
[1:31:10] Lord [singing]
[1:31:12] Jesus. [music]
[1:31:14] Keep me [singing] true.
[1:31:22] There's a race [singing]
[1:31:24] [music] that I must run.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; There are victories
[1:31:32] to be [singing] won.
[1:31:35] Give me [music] power,
[1:31:39] every
[1:31:40] hour [singing]
[1:31:42] to be true.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to ask a question before
[1:31:48] we close the service.
[1:31:51] Is there anyone here that would be
[1:31:52] interested
[1:31:54] in having a Bible study and going
[1:31:56] through the seven church age book and do
[1:31:59] it about two times a month on the Sunday
[1:32:02] evening? Would you be interested if if I
[1:32:04] said we'll do it and I make a
[1:32:06] commitment? Would you come and be here
[1:32:08] with us?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Have a time. Hey, listen. I've been
[1:32:12] rejoicing. And brother Renham says, let
[1:32:14] me quote you. He says, "You can't
[1:32:17] understand the opening of the seals
[1:32:19] until you get the foundation of the
[1:32:21] seven church ages." And he said, "Like a
[1:32:24] mighty burst of illumination that comes
[1:32:26] forth from a Roman candle." He said,
[1:32:29] "There illumination after illumination
[1:32:32] is coming [music] forth and there before
[1:32:35] our wondering eyes."
[1:32:37] So when we get the foundation of the
[1:32:39] seven church ages and what he did in the
[1:32:42] Ephesian church age, he said what he
[1:32:44] starts in Ephesus, he goes to through to
[1:32:47] Thitara and keeps going all the way down
[1:32:49] to Laudia because what God starts, he
[1:32:53] keeps it going. Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; So we see then we see in every church
[1:32:57] age what they have to overcome. how the
[1:33:00] enemy comes in and tries to dissuade
[1:33:02] them, discourage, get people
[1:33:04] disappointed and and and go away from
[1:33:06] the truth. And so we see these patterns
[1:33:10] and these cycles and how that brother
[1:33:13] Bram said, "Watch at by the time the
[1:33:15] fourth generation,"
[1:33:18] he said, "the's just a few embers left
[1:33:20] of that original flame."
[1:33:22] Okay? We've got ones like brother Bobby
[1:33:25] and brother Paul
[1:33:29] that saw brother Brenham was in meetings
[1:33:32] heard him perhaps shook his hand
[1:33:36] that's first generation I'm second
[1:33:38] generation can I come he's already
[1:33:42] brother Brandham's already gone passed
[1:33:44] off the scene so I'm second generation
[1:33:47] my kids Amos you're third generation
[1:33:51] Malachi you're fourth
[1:33:55] What will this message be like
[1:33:58] if you have kids? You get married and
[1:34:00] you have kids.
[1:34:02] Will there be the holding the same
[1:34:04] standard?
[1:34:07] What will there be any resemblance of
[1:34:10] what the original message was like? Will
[1:34:13] there be any more holiness?
[1:34:17] What will things be like? How will they
[1:34:19] preach? What will they do?
[1:34:22] Oh God,
[1:34:25] one thing about a fire, all of you have
[1:34:28] gone camping. All of you love to go
[1:34:30] camping. You go every time you you can
[1:34:34] and that's fine. But you have a fire.
[1:34:36] There's something about a campfire.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; They sit around the fire and a lot of
[1:34:40] times you don't have to say much.
[1:34:42] Everybody just sits and looks at the
[1:34:44] fire.
[1:34:47] Wow. Because God is fire. Our God is
[1:34:51] likened unto a consuming fire. So
[1:34:53] there's something about fire that's
[1:34:56] intriguing.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But
[1:35:02] if you sit there and you have this nice
[1:35:03] fire, what happens if you don't keep
[1:35:06] feeding it?
[1:35:11] It just dies and goes out.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; What about this fiery experience that
[1:35:17] you've got with God?
[1:35:19] If you don't fuel the fire, that's a
[1:35:22] good sermon.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; If you don't fuel it, it'll go out. If
[1:35:30] you don't obey it, he said, I'll take
[1:35:32] that candlestick from you.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; To keep this. I say, Lord,
[1:35:43] here I am in latter stages of my life.
[1:35:49] Don't let this revival fire die.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Help me to pass it on to others
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; because it only takes a spark to get a
[1:35:57] fire going.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[1:36:02] coming [music] tonight. God bless you.
[1:36:04] So, the Lord willing, I looked at my
[1:36:07] schedule. November and December is
[1:36:10] really full. I won't be able to do it,
[1:36:12] but starting the new year, we will try
[1:36:16] to do two Sundays a month.
[1:36:18] and we'll do it every other week. And
[1:36:21] we'll do it Sunday afternoon, Sunday
[1:36:24] evening, let's say, and we'll get
[1:36:25] together and we'll meet over here in the
[1:36:27] senior Sunday school room. And I will
[1:36:29] see what the attendance will be like the
[1:36:32] first time that we have it to see if I
[1:36:34] have to move it in here because I would
[1:36:37] rather have it in there because I'm not
[1:36:39] afraid of a small group.
[1:36:42] In fact, I kind of like smaller groups
[1:36:43] because they're a little bit more
[1:36:44] intimate. You can talk to them a little
[1:36:46] bit more. get a large group. It's hard
[1:36:48] to I I like, you know, so but I want to
[1:36:52] see if you're really interested, if you
[1:36:54] really want to do it, you want to have
[1:36:55] Bible study, we we sit down, we go
[1:36:57] through this and we dissect it
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; because why do we believe what we
[1:37:02] believe?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; It all comes back to this.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; A prophet will never bring you
[1:37:08] something, but what he brings you right
[1:37:10] back to this.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:37:14] this is our absolute
[1:37:17] Amen. Thank God for that. Amen. God
[1:37:19] bless you. We'll sing this song another
[1:37:22] time. And I I trust that all of you
[1:37:25] tonight,
[1:37:27] No, I didn't really preach. I just kind
[1:37:29] of read some quotes and we we just
[1:37:31] visited. There are times my voice is a
[1:37:35] little bit gone right now.
[1:37:38] I needed to relax a little bit, just
[1:37:42] talk to you. Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; There are times,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; brother Mark, when you sit down with
[1:37:48] your kids, you talk to them,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Just have a mom and dad time and sit
[1:37:55] down and visit with them. Hey kids, how
[1:37:57] you doing?
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And just visit with them. So, God bless
[1:38:02] you. Thank you for being here. God bless
[1:38:06] you each and everyone. I'll not ramble
[1:38:08] on anymore. God bless you, brother Mark.
[1:38:10] Go ahead and sing this. I'm going to try
[1:38:12] to I need one of these young boys.
[1:38:15] Malachi, come here. Grab these books
[1:38:16] here for me.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You be my messenger. You be my
[1:38:20] forerunner.
[1:38:22] Come on, Mal. Let's go to my [music]
[1:38:23] office.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Keep me true,
[1:38:29] Lord
[1:38:30] Jesus.
[1:38:32] Keep me true.

[1:38:43] Lord [music and singing]
[1:38:44] Jesus.
[1:38:46] Keep be true.
[1:38:54] There's a race [music]
[1:38:56] that I [singing]
[1:38:58] must run. And there are victories
[1:39:05] to be won. [singing]
[1:39:08] Give me power
[1:39:11] every
[1:39:13] hour
[1:39:14] to be. Sing it one more time.
[1:39:21] Oh, keep me true,
[1:39:25] [singing] Lord
[1:39:27] Jesus. [music]
[1:39:29] Keep me true.
[1:39:36] Keep me true,
[1:39:40] Lord
[1:39:42] Jesus.
[1:39:43] Keep me true.
[1:39:48] [music]
[1:39:51] There's a race
[1:39:54] that I must run and there are victories
[1:40:02] to be won. [music and singing]
[1:40:05] Give me
[1:40:07] power
[1:40:09] every
[1:40:10] hour
[1:40:12] to be.
[1:40:14] I'm amazed that you love me.
[1:40:19] I'm amazed [singing]
[1:40:23] that you [music] love me.
[1:40:26] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:40:30] how you care.
[1:40:34] Through your preious
[1:40:37] blood. I [music] found pardon.
[1:40:41] And all my sins are [singing] washed.
[1:40:46] They're all washed away. [music] All my
[1:40:50] sins
[1:40:51] are washed.
[1:40:53] Let's sing it again.
[1:40:56] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:41:00] that [music] you love me.
[1:41:03] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:41:07] how you care.
[1:41:11] Through your precious
[1:41:14] blood. I found pardon.
[1:41:18] And [music and singing] all my sins
[1:41:21] are washed. They're all
[1:41:23] [music and singing] washed away. All my
[1:41:26] sins
[1:41:28] are washed. [music and singing]
[1:41:30] Let's sing it one more time.
[1:41:32] Yes, I'm amazed
[1:41:37] that you love me.
[1:41:40] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:41:44] how you care.
[1:41:48] Through your preious
[1:41:50] blood. I found pardon.
[1:41:55] All my sins are [singing] washed.
[1:41:59] They're all washed away. All my sins
[1:42:05] are washed [music]
[1:42:07] away. [singing]
[1:42:09] Amen. Brother Ezra, would you come and
[1:42:11] close our service in a word of prayer?
[1:42:13] Just a reminder, family night on Friday,
[1:42:15] 5:30, and then our lunchon on Sunday. If
[1:42:18] you haven't signed up, please do so.
[1:42:20] Amen. Brother,
[1:42:25] let's just pray. Lord Jesus, Father,
[1:42:28] we're indeed grateful, Lord, to be in
[1:42:30] your house, Lord, to sit around the fire
[1:42:34] of the word of God and to remember those
[1:42:37] things that would have been taught us by
[1:42:39] a prophet of God, Lord, that was
[1:42:40] vindicated by our [music] pillar of
[1:42:43] fire. Lord, we thank you for a pastor
[1:42:45] that will take time to dissect the word
[1:42:47] of God so that we can understand it,
[1:42:49] Father. Lord, you've opened the word to
[1:42:51] our hearts. Lord, may we receive it into
[1:42:53] our lives. Lord, that we can live an
[1:42:55] over andcoming life, Lord, that we're
[1:42:58] set aside from the world and the things
[1:43:00] of this life. Oh God, bring us back
[1:43:02] safely, Lord, in these season of your
[1:43:04] coming. Father, we ask you'd strengthen
[1:43:06] our pastor. [music] Strengthen the sick
[1:43:08] among us. Oh God, we still believe
[1:43:10] you're a healer. You're the same
[1:43:12] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh God,
[1:43:14] bless your people. Strengthen them and
[1:43:16] protect them in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you're walking
[1:43:24] through the valley
[1:43:27] and there are shadows
[1:43:29] all [singing]
[1:43:30] around,
[1:43:33] do not fear
[1:43:35] for God will guide you and he will keep
[1:43:39] [music] you safe and sound.
[1:43:44] For he has promised
[1:43:47] to never leave you
[1:43:50] nor forsake you.
[1:43:53] And his word is true. God is good
[1:43:59] all the time.
[1:44:01] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:44:06] mine. God is good
[1:44:10] all the time.
[1:44:13] Through the darkest [music]
[1:44:15] night, his light will shine. God is
[1:44:19] good.
[1:44:21] Oh, God is good.
[1:44:25] All the time
[1:44:27] and we were sinners,
[1:44:30] so unworthy.
[1:44:33] Yet for us, he [music] chose to die.
[1:44:39] He filled us with
[1:44:42] his holy spirit.
[1:44:45] Now we can stand and testify. [music]
[1:44:51] That is love
[1:44:54] is everlasting.
[1:44:57] And his mercies
[1:45:00] they will never [singing]
[1:45:02] end. God is good
[1:45:05] all the time.
[1:45:08] He put a song of praise
[1:45:12] in this [music] heart of mine. Oh, God
[1:45:14] is good
[1:45:17] all the time. [music and singing]
[1:45:20] Through the darkest night, his light
[1:45:24] will shine. For God is good.
[1:45:28] Oh, God is good.
[1:45:31] Sing the chorus again.
[1:45:34] Oh, God is good
[1:45:37] all the time.
[1:45:40] He put a song [music and singing]
[1:45:42] of praise in this heart of mine. God is
[1:45:47] good
[1:45:49] all the time.
[1:45:52] Through the darkest [music]
[1:45:54] night, his light will shine for God is
[1:45:58] good.
[1:46:00] Oh, God is good.
[1:46:03] Our God is good.
[1:46:06] Our God is good
[1:46:09] all the time.
[1:46:13] God is good all the time. Go in
[1:46:15] [cheering] Jesus name. You are
[1:46:17] dismissed. Amen.
[1:47:09] Heat. Heat.
[1:47:44] Heat. Heat.
[1:48:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:48:28] Heat. Heat.
[1:48:51] Jack.
[1:49:19] Hey.
