It's it's been about nine months since I've seen my cardiologist and uh everything and and so uh I went and saw a doctor the other yesterday and I got all my blood work back and there was a couple things there that need a little adjustment and uh he suggested some vitamins and everything. Other than that, uh, uh, everything looked good, but I went in today and had an angiogram and an EKG, and my doctor says, "You've got severe aortic stenosis of the aortic valve." And he said, "You need a valve replacement." And he said, "So, um, he said, you went from a 1.5 to a 0.9." And he said, "That's urgent." And he said, "If it was a degree or so down, it would be an emergency." He said, "So, uh, when he came in, he didn't ask me, "Do you want to do it?" He said, "We're going to do it. We're going to get it done as soon as possible." And then, "Yes, doc." Okay, whatever. And listen, um, you know, I just believe that God does use doctors, &gt;&gt; huh? Otherwise, you would have to say that they're not of God. Then none of you go. You break an arm, you have your sickness, you got pneumonia, don't go. Just stay home. Um, in other words, listen, God does use doctors and so we thank God for that. And um uh they want to do what they call a a taver, a trans aortic valve replacement where they don't open the the the chest, but they can go through the femoral artery, come in. And they showed me pictures of it and then they go up that aortic uh aorta and go into the valve and then they oh they they balloon it open with a stent like and then they replace it with a another valve. And I said, "Wow." And he I said, "How how long will I be in the hospital?" "Just overnight. You'll be out the next day." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Wow." [laughter] Yeah. Okay. Just don't cut me open. You know, I'll be But anyway, uh so uh yeah. So how soon? I don't know. uh within because the uh person that does the scheduling for was out today and said they'll call tomorrow and said so there's four tests that I've got to go through prior to the procedure and if all of those are a green light well then uh hopefully we'll get it done before Thanksgiving or if it can't then after Thanksgiving and before Christmas. So, uh just uh letting all of you know um and you all be remembering us in prayer. We know that our life is in God's hand and uh I'm not scared or afraid or whatever. All right, let's go. Let's get it done. Got to do what you got to do, right? Uh it's not the the year uh or the model, it's the mileage. I've got a lot of miles on this. I had a heart transplant in 1971. God took the old &gt;&gt; transplant. &gt;&gt; I had a heart transplant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1971. &gt;&gt; He took the old fleshly heart that I had and gave me a new heart. &gt;&gt; All right. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, you know, my wife's going, "Oh, [laughter] man. DON'T BE LYING BEHIND THAT PULP. I AIN'T LYING. Telling you the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God is a heart specialist. How many of you had have had heart work? &gt;&gt; Ah yeah, you've had heart work. But this old body that we got, it breaks down. My eyes are going bad. My earring hearing is going bad. And uh you know Yeah. And the doctor asked me, he says, "Well, you know these s symptoms? Do you do you have any symptoms of this?" Well, what are they? And he says, "Well, kind of shortness of breath and you get tired easy and everything." I said, "Doc, I'm 72." That, you know, I you know, talk to the brothers on the the morning breakfast Monday morning. We all got that. We're all saying, "Yeah, man. I tell you, it's hard to get up this morning." You know? [laughter] So, he says, "No." He says, "Actually," he said, "probably after that," he says, "you'll find out that with more blood flow, you you won't feel as tired." And honestly, uh, Sunday morning when I preach, when I'm done, I'm &gt;&gt; worked over. I'm done. Yeah, I'm well done. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And so, anyway, I just letting all of you know, keeping you uh up to date with what I have heard. And uh, so just put it in in God's hands. And on the lighter side, on the lighter side, Ethan Straer was in the back telling the brothers and everything like this. And he said, "Well, I suggest um that uh Brother Jonathan sing before you give that testimony." He created me a clean heart. Oh, God. [laughter] I said, "You're funny, Ethan." I said, "Agre." So, anyway, we love you guys and be praying for us. Um, we just put it in God's hands and we go from there. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you, Brother Jonathan. Let's sing another song. We'll go into it. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand as brother Mario comes singing. Healing is here. Quite a few of us need healing tonight. Let's just claim it. Amen. Healing is here. Healing is here. [music] Healing is here. and I receive [music and singing] it. Do you believe that this evening? Oh, healing is here. [music] Oh, healing [singing] is here. [music] Healing is here.

Sing freedom is here as brother Mario comes. Freedom [singing] is here. Oh, freedom [singing and music] is here. Freedom is here [singing] and I receive it. Freedom [music and singing] is here. Oh, [music] freedom is here. Oh, freedom [singing and music] is here and I believe [music] it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Because where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. There is freedom. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ because in his name there is always power. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is deliverance. &gt;&gt; And we believe that he is here &gt;&gt; according to his promise. &gt;&gt; So I would like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and also bring greetings from the saints in Ottawa. So I was there last November 1st and 2nd. So it's just a new church maybe a young church uh four four months I think. So they have their first communion on last November the 1st. So I preach for them November 1st and November 2nd. Then on November the 9th I'm in Petroia. So I also bring greetings from the saints in Petroia and I want to thank each and everyone for remembering us in prayer where we were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. So our travel is too smooth and really feel the presence of the Lord. Uh while we fly back uh there's no cancellations of our flight, no rescheduling. Uh although we have uh delayed for a few hours, it's understandable because we experienced the first snowfall &gt;&gt; in Canada. So we have a advanced snow white Christmas they call that. &gt;&gt; So I really appreciate all your prayer for remembering us and also for the appreciations gift that you've given us. So I receive cards and gifts and all of that. So I cannot mention names because if I mention one name and forget somebody maybe somebody will get you know some loving reaction. So, so I just want to thank you and appreciate each and everyone for remembering us. Amen. So, we'll just go directly to the word of God and I believe that we are in great expectations tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Although we can uh feel the the weather is about changing, it's getting cold, but I believe that the pillar of fire is here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Make us Amen. make us warm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we always he promised that he will be in our midst tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we'll just go directly to the word of God. Uh turn with me in the book of Genesis, a very familiar scripture. So I'm not bringing any new uh understanding, new revelation but just putting in reme in remembrance the things that we have already learned &gt;&gt; to gives us encouragement. Amen. Genesis chapter 3 verse 6 it says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye so we will notice that pleasant to the eye so it's a strong visual factor connected to Eve being deceived so one of the biggest areas of personal Deception is when something look pleasant to the eye but underneath is a poison. Because mostly things that look pleasant to the eye, we're talking about worldly things. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are hiding death and poison and sorrows beneath it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The surface. So, and a tree to be desired to make one wise. So, she took one of the fruit thereof and did eat it and gave also unto her husband with her. and he did it. Now she is spreading her newfound knowledge of deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the pattern of how deception and death spread like virus from one person to another. Uh another scripture in Matthew chap 24:4 they're very familiar scripture. And there shall arise false Christ and false prophets, and shall great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elected. &gt;&gt; But we have the message of the hour and understand and know that it is very impossible for the elect to be deceived. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the elect is part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us bow our head. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just &gt;&gt; appreciate your presence tonight, Lord God. And we just been so blessed to be in the house of the Lord [clears throat] and you promise wherever two or three are gathered in your name, you will be in our midst, Lord God. So, we are just privileged, Lord, that you give us strength to gather together and appreciate your goodness, Lord. appreciate your revelation. Appreciate your word of letting us letting us know who we are, Lord, and putting us in our position, oh God, to claim all the benefits that you have done for us, Lord. Once again, we invite your presence to be with us, Lord, and break the bread of life among us, Lord, to encourage us, Lord, to lift our faith a little bit higher, Lord God. &gt;&gt; So, we commit the service to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So you can be seated for a while. So I saw brother David and sister Anita Mayor. God bless you. Good to see you. Praise God. So I would like to title this uh little thought that God put in my heart deception in the evening time. &gt;&gt; So evening time is also called the harvest time. And the harvest time is also we know is the end time. So the deception at the evening time is on a personal level. So there are many forms of deceptions and many level of deception. So a nation can deceive a nation and a businessman can deceive a bellow of businessmen. And then there is when a person is deceived on a personal level and that is by far the most common area of deception today. Personal deception. So definition for deception is described as the act of making someone believe something that is not true. So deception takes place at a belief level. What you believe which is at your soul level. So deception at a personal level is a reality really a spiritual condition because there are many words that are also used in associations with this word deception success fraud, cheating, trickery, scamming, slightness, deceitfulness, fraud and so forth and so on. But the author is only one and that is the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have all and we have all had experience in some level in our journey in this life. May it be in business, in school or something or friend. Amen. So, and the reason that this happened to us is that we mostly don't actually know or have all the truth about what we are making our decision about. We just see something or advertising and make a decision based on what someone else had presented to us from the angle and it looked on the surface to be a good good thing. Even brother Brham experienced this in his ministry when he was in LA when he preached about the message oneness. So maybe he was he said that he was in a room with the television in it. So maybe he was invited and have a hotel and that hotel room there was a television and there was something that like the weather condition and he he put on the television to see what is the weather condition and while he was looking it there was an advertisement he said. So he said that I turn on the news and when I was hearing the news then I noticed that in the middle of the newscast they broke up to advertise some kind of a good some kind of detergent. And he said you don't have to wash your dieses anymore lady. The only thing you do is stick it right down in the water and let it there a couple of minutes raise it up and put it on the drain board. It's all over. &gt;&gt; What a great advers. He was so excited. &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Wow." And he said, "I thought I'm going to be a hero when I get home." So he put the name of that put the name of a certain uh detergent and he said, "I tell my wife, look what I can do." So I went and got a bottle of this suckle strap and I squirted it for her. So I got the children's plate and rake out the crumb and so forth and the eggs sticking on it, drop it down the water and let it set a few minutes. So he was excited. what he saw. I'm sure &gt;&gt; this will happen &gt;&gt; and it drop it down the water and let it set for a few minutes and pick them out and set them on there. There's just as much egg on them as there was when I put it there. [laughter] Amen. He said I have lost my wife would lost confidence in me by that time. Amen. So out of his heart he said, "You see, why does the nation why does this nation let the people be deceived?" &gt;&gt; I said that ought to be allowed to be said like that that ought to be against the law. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. There must be something brother. Amen. So you see, why does the nation why does this nation let the people be deceived? &gt;&gt; That ought to be allowed to be said like that. at ought to be against the law. So we are easily deceived only have part of the truth &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; about something because when the whole truth is revealed then that is what actually uncover the deception &gt;&gt; and we know that God's word is the whole truth and so that is why we if we ever make a decision that is opposing to the word of God and we automatically automatically if we oppose the word of God automatically we become come you know we become in the state of deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are trusting in our own limited understanding and reasoning instead of the eternal truth of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the message looking at the unseen when he preached in LA said when God made men he made him thus for he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne his control tower. God wants to lead men but man wants to lead himself. Therefore there is a war constantly the man wants to go after what he see with his eye. That's where he's deceived. &gt;&gt; That's where Satan deceived Eve by what she could see. And the fruit was pleasant to the eye, but it was death to the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in this day and age that we find ourselves living in such visually influenced world &gt;&gt; and so Satan has taken advantage of this and use the medium of televisions of the internet of the way word all all the kind of social media &gt;&gt; as a tool to deceive the people of the world in this age has he did in the beginning with Eve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when you go to the airport, everybody is on their cell phone, maybe looking movies or something or social media, everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so as a result of this, we find ourselves living in the greatest time of darkness. And we know that darkness in the Bible means spiritual ignorance where people are being taken in by scam of all various kind of personal deception because they are actually walking in great darkness of Laudishian age and they don't know that they are they are blinded to the fact &gt;&gt; a lot of ignorance because they never see the truth of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is so much information out there that it is almost impossible to know what is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is only part true &gt;&gt; and which is part true and which is part lie and then what is a total lie because in our generations praise God the wrong will become right and the right become wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the in in uh our opening scripture in Genesis says, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eye, and the tree to be desired to make wise, we see that a woman was deceived through the medium of her visual world that look attractive to her eyes. And if that was what we saw in Genesis in seed form, it will multiply in revelation in the harvest &gt;&gt; time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It reveal again in revelation harvest time in a multiple form. So Revelation chapter 13 11 it says, "And I beheld another beast coming out of the earth." So it's not coming out of the sea, coming out of the earth. So as the prophet said, it was America &gt;&gt; and he had two horns like a lamb and brother Brennham said that it is an an American buffalo and he spake as a dragon. So America isn't the dragon. Rome is the dragon, the beast. But America is going to speak as the dragon because the Roman church and the state of America will unite together. &gt;&gt; Rome is the religious power. America has the military power to enforce the will of the Roman church. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And he exercises all the power of the first beast because before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly womb was healed. So the prophet explained it in the message mark of the beast and we know a lot of scripture brother brotherly uh teach about the the mark of the beast. Amen. Revelation 13. This beast who was before America whose deadly wound was healed was the Roman Catholic Church. The nation of Rome, pagan Rome, fell and was delivered a blow unto death. But the spirit of the Roman nation came back to life again in the papal religious spirit of the Roman Catholic Church with all the pagan ways of the old Roman nation now living on in Roman Catholic Church. Verse 13. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come from down from heaven and on the earth in the sight of men. As the prophet said, it was atomic bomb in Jerusima, Herusima and Nagazaki. As the prophet said, it was atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb. And this is a fire that has come out that come about because of the opening of the bottomless pit in Revelation chapter 9. The key that opened up the pit of hell was the key of science and technology. &gt;&gt; The fourth dimension. &gt;&gt; Great wonders are achieved in this end time age because of science and technology. That is what is causing people to be blinded to the truth. So they are so wow out by the wonders of technology that they have become deceived by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially all the inventions, all the rocket science, all the technology, all the AI. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes our life easier. But the more we we we we accept the modern technology, the more we become uh not sensitive to Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that the prayer of the saints is more powerful, a million times stronger than angels. Society is trying to take away our prayer life &gt;&gt; by the technology, by the amusement, by our cell phone, by whatever social media that we are in. Almost all our time is consumed by the technology. &gt;&gt; Remember that we need to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without ceasing &gt;&gt; because your prayer is a million times stronger than angel. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you need to pray. &gt;&gt; We can see all the calamities all around us. Storm there, storm here, earthquake there. Who is who will be the one to stand in the gap &gt;&gt; when that happen? Because we become praise God the a coworker with God. We will stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Who will pray for them? &gt;&gt; It is now our responsibility. As the prophet said, your prayer is much stronger. But Satan knows about it. So that's why he bombarded us with all this technology. Praise God. All this happening, looking at the our our media through sport or something like that. And sometimes we forgot to pray. &gt;&gt; We only pray when we eat. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. Even when we pray, just thank you, Lord. May you sanctify it. &gt;&gt; Which is okay. &gt;&gt; Instead of praying for your fruit from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we need to pray. &gt;&gt; When we wake up, we need to pray. We pray for somebody. Not don't pray for just yourself. &gt;&gt; Pray for somebody those who are in need. &gt;&gt; Dispute is empty. Maybe somebody is is is in something in trouble or trial that they cannot make it tonight. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So thinking negative about that. &gt;&gt; You need to think positively. &gt;&gt; Lord help them brother. If they are not here Lord maybe they are something in trouble or trial in their life they are undergoing IN THEIR LIFE. LORD HALLELUJAH. BY YOUR GRACE AND YOUR MERCY Lord being a mouthpiece OF THIS GOD BEING LORD I AM I STAND IN THE GAP between them Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is our duty right now my brother and sisters. So let us pray more and more and more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you you you don't want to hear oh prayer pray. Oh I pray I pray &gt;&gt; but we need prayer not for ourselves. Prayer for somebody. Yes. &gt;&gt; When God put something in your heart, let you remember your memory. Something a brother you thought of somebody your brother. Praise God. It was God inspired you to pray for that brother. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. Good preaching. &gt;&gt; Don't always pray for yourself. Lord, I lost my job. I lost this. I lost that. I lost that. I lost my business. No, don't think about that. God knows about it all. &gt;&gt; That's right. Just he said that seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things that will be added unto you. What we need to think about is our people in the last days. We are looking for the last day and we are in great expectation praise God for the coming of the Lord. And we we are expecting something for the coming of the Lord. That expectations must influence our thinking and our life and our action. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if we are looking for the coming of the Lord, our action need something to reflect that expectation. &gt;&gt; You need to pray &gt;&gt; because not everybody can go when some when only one is left behind. &gt;&gt; So we need to claim everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to claim. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now verse 14. And they deceived them that dwell on the earth by means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had a wound by a sword and did live. Notice should make an image to the beast. An image is something that you see with your eye. In other words, sight and deception are again associated together at the end time when not just one woman was deceived on a personal level but the entire world would be drawn into deception. &gt;&gt; That is why Hollywood has been successful in influencing the entire world by the visual aid of television. Eve was deceived by the influence and the deception of what she saw. &gt;&gt; Tell vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By what the serpent told her and by what she saw with her eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 15. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should not speak should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. &gt;&gt; Although this prophecy not pertains to the elect pertains to the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. So when the church and state unite together again in this end time age, then we will see the same thing that we saw in the dark ages where they will put everything to death that doesn't agree with them. &gt;&gt; So we need wisdom, &gt;&gt; we need revelation, we need understanding in these last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need revelation more than anything else. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church." So, we need wisdom. We need revelation. We need understanding in these last days. &gt;&gt; King Solomon in his Proverbs chapter 16 verse 16. How much better it is to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver. It's good to have silver and gold, but wisdom is better because you can lose all your money. But when wisdom is given to you by God, then that is the very source of your wealth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job lost all of his silvers and gold and everything. &gt;&gt; But he never lose his wisdom. And in the end, he became twice wealthy as he is &gt;&gt; because God restored double time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why if you are in a trial right now, it seems some things is is lost. Everything is lost. We have a pattern. &gt;&gt; Just continue believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just continue serving the Lord in the good time and in the bad time because at the end, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it will multiply and he will double it &gt;&gt; if you continue on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just don't lose wisdom and understanding in the word of God. Seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And 17, the highway of the upright is to depart from evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that giveth his way preserveth his souls. Praise God. Pride goeth before destruction and a hotty spirit before a fault. &gt;&gt; So hoty spirit, attitude of arrogance and pride. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what has become in this eight a holoty spirit that the Hollywood has produced in the masses by deception of television. Holty arrogance. Revelation chapter 3. I don't need I don't need anything. I am rich. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the scriptures that you are miserable, rich, naked, and you don't know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide a spoil with a pearl. &gt;&gt; He that handle a matter wisely shall find good. And whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he. &gt;&gt; So when the wisdom of God and humility come together in a person, then that is what is reflecting God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God because these two qualities are part of God's two great characteristic &gt;&gt; humbleness. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Wisdom and humility. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So wisdom is so important. Even the queen of the south, praise God, travel in order to seek the wisdom of Solomon. &gt;&gt; And greater than Solomon is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is greater than Solomon. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when ignorance of the word of God and pride join together that then that person or church or nation depending on whatever level this is on is doomed for destruction. So this is exactly what happened to King Nebuchadnezzar when he was lifted up with the pride of his own ability and loses mana and he became insane. a type of disad going into total insanity because the pride and arrogance against God. So in Genesis we find that one woman was deceived on a personal level. In Revelation we find that all the people of the word that are outside of the knowledge of the revealed word of this hour are also being deceived. Each one &gt;&gt; on a personal level. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the message a deceived church by the word when brother Brennham preached in June of 1959. Brother Bham takes the the the uh took it took the text from Judges chapter 16 speaking about Samson and we know the story of Samson being deceived by Delilah which represent the false church of this hour. We find that Delilah had combined with the state military might that was backing her just like we see prophecy 13 where the church and the state Romans and Romans and America will unite together in this hour to bring deception upon those whose name are not written on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Those whose name are not written in the lamb's book of life will be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the elect of God will not be deceived because full truth has been revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if a false church is deceived by the world, then the true church must be enlightened by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So at the opening and the revealing of the word to the bride in this hour is the only thing that will withstand the deception in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The opening of the word, the revealing of the word, hallelujah, is the only thing that will withstand the deception of this hour. No other truth or secret knowledge or conspiracy theory will do it. Only the revelation of the opening of the full word in this hour will be able to stand against the deception of this hour. We become an invisible army, &gt;&gt; a super race. Amen. Hallelujah. So look at Daniel. In Daniel's time, the state changed the law relating to his religious belief. Amen. And in one day, Daniel was made a criminal. He was thrown into the lion's den. Praise God. But remember when they throw Daniel into a lion's den, that was also the time when the lion came into a condition of what they were before the fall of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is like Adam and Eden again. &gt;&gt; And that is promised in this age because the angel has brought us back to us the title deed of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. of the ownership of the earth by the opening of the seventh seal. So the condition is returning back to the condition of Eden. &gt;&gt; The animal under the prophet Noah's ministry came into an edenic condition and were at peace with one another &gt;&gt; while under the influence of Noah's ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not quarreling. They are at peace with one another &gt;&gt; because God is restoring. Hallelujah. The original &gt;&gt; condition in Eden &gt;&gt; during that time like the killer bull that would have killed brother Bernham &gt;&gt; but it hadn't been for that divine love that God gave to him right then. It was the love of God. It was the Eden condition during the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because brother Brham at the rising of the sun he was the first sheep to be waved. It was God now came down in this deadic condition &gt;&gt; and we need to recognize that condition. Praise God. Because we are already uh covered up by this word that we forgot that we are now in the hidden condition because the ownership of the title deed of ownership is being restored to each one of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us not always limit the benefit that God gave us in these last days. We need to exercise it. Amen. If something happen, we need to speak the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there is a storm, speak the word. &gt;&gt; The storm in your life, the trial, YOU SPEAK THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I AM THE SON of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't claim those trials. I am not doom. I am not something. Praise God. But I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; God died for me because God wants to express himself in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't want TO BE A FLOWER BASE. HE WANTS ME TO EXPRESS HIMSELF in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we are living under our benefits. &gt;&gt; It is now now to we need to stand. We need to recognize that we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT BOUND BY TIME but we ARE BOUND INTO ETERNITY. WE need to express somebody. We need to express the love of God in our heart. &gt;&gt; Let us not talk about trials and testing. Oh, I am this. I am that. Oh, I am sorry. I am No. SPEAK ABOUT THE PROMISES OF GOD. HE DIED FOR ME SO THAT HE WILL RESTORE. I CAN SPEAK SOMETHING INTO EXISTING BY GOD'S GRACE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You need to pray. You need to speak. You need to recognize your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The failure of the entire world and the entire human race of mankind, the animal kingdom, the boat in the life and all the sea life was when one individual woman was deceived &gt;&gt; on a personal level. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1, Genesis 3, one woman personally deceived in her belief. Revelation. Now the whole world is deceived by each individual person of the world being deceived personally in their belief because deception has to do with your belief. &gt;&gt; But the bride of Christ in this hour is promised that she would not be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She would not deceive because why? Because he was part OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A part of the word that she is part of the word. is the word and it is impossible to deceive the word itself. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet in these last days that let us know who we are. WE ARE PART OF THE WORD OF GOD IN THIS last days. If we are THE PART OF THE WORD THEN WE NEED TO EXPRESS THE WORD IN our life. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Let us not walk just like the denomination do this and do that do this and do that. Let us be led by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord let thy will be done on my heart. Lord &gt;&gt; in the message Messiah he preached in Shri report. He said he talk about Billy Graham. Billy Graham quoted Matthew chapter 24:24. Praise God that the elect if possible will be deceived. And Billy Graham say that the other in the message he said the elected is already deceived. &gt;&gt; No. No. As brother. The elected ain't going to be deceived. No. No. They won't be. &gt;&gt; No. The church member will &gt;&gt; but not the elect. IF YOU ARE JUST A CHURCH MEMBER, HALLELUJAH. YOU WILL BE DECEIVED. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A CHURCH MEMBER. ONLY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE IN LACK OF GOD. IT IS NOT DAY THAT YOU ARE PART OF THE WORD SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T BE A CHURCH MEMBER. &gt;&gt; Go to CHURCH BY YOUR TITHE. DON'T BE LIKE THAT. BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. BE AN ELECTED. &gt;&gt; STAND ON YOUR TWO. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And claim your promises. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT BE DECEIVED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU ARE ELECTED, PRAISE GOD. EVEN though you want to go around, you don't &gt;&gt; you can never be deceived. The prophet said, "No, no, no. &gt;&gt; The elected ain't going to be deceived." No, no, no, no. They won't. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no, no." &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Oh, you do this, you do that, do you do this, you are not son of God." Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no, no." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I AM A SEED OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; AND GOD, DON'T LOOK AT MY SHORTCOMINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God looked our heart because we believe the word and it was imputed FOR US FOR HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY BELIEVING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Tell Satan, "No, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; But you commit this, but you commit that." No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; I'M BEING WASHED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. when okay &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; church member will be but not the elected they was chosen &gt;&gt; yeah that's right &gt;&gt; from the foundation of the WORD &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CHOSEN ABOVE ALL THE MILLIONS OF THE WORLD YOU WERE CHOSEN YOU WERE ELECTED YOU ARE SELECTED TO STAND AND MAGNIFY GOD IN this loudest year and age WHERE THERE'S TOTAL DARKNESS, THERE IS STILL LIGHT SHINING AMONG US. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Sons of God are the light of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; They cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They cannot be deceived. It's impossible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; So that's why whatever you do, whatever things in your life, you never be in this place without the grace of God. Because not everybody received the message but you here even Wednesday night you hear the worship God. &gt;&gt; Have you wondered why? &gt;&gt; Because you are part of God. &gt;&gt; And you cannot help yourself to come. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID if you are a Christian it not your desire to be a Christian. It is God's desire for you to be a Christian because no one can come to him except the father draws him there. &gt;&gt; So we ARE HERE BY GOD'S GRACE. WE ARE THE MANIFESTATIONS. PRAISE GOD. Of his word &gt;&gt; that wherever two or three gather in his name, he will be in our midst. Hallelujah. And he is speaking for us tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5. So the Bible said that false Christ would rise in the last days and would deceive the very elected if it was possible. But it's not possible. &gt;&gt; How many time did we tell Satan it's not possible? &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH HOW MUCH YOU TELL ME &gt;&gt; that I am not an elected. It is impossible. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY SENT. HALLELUJAH. I DIDN'T FIND GOD. I DIDN'T SEEK TO FIND GOD. BUT GOD SEEK TO FIND ME. &gt;&gt; I AM HIS SON. HALLELUJAH. AND HE LET me know that I am his son before the foundation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was just like &gt;&gt; Abraham when they went to Aimilec. &gt;&gt; He tells Sarah, "Tell the king that you are my sister &gt;&gt; or else if they know they will kill me." But then when the king so excited, praise God, he said, "Okay, I have a beautiful bride tomorrow. Spotless, beautiful, flawless with beautiful blue eyes. She will be my wife." &gt;&gt; But God, Hallelujah. Show him in the dream. &gt;&gt; Return &gt;&gt; my prophet's wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you will not return, I will kill you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bypass Abraham's shortcoming &gt;&gt; because he already believed the promised word and it was imputed for him for his righteousness. &gt;&gt; He didn't decide TO COMMIT SIN. BUT GOD bypass all of that. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RETURN MY PROPHET. HE IDENTIFY RETURN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Return &gt;&gt; my sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Help. &gt;&gt; If you are suffering, you need to say, "Satan, &gt;&gt; come out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, I will not go. &gt;&gt; I will not go that way. Amen. See, the Bible said that the false Christ would rise in the last days. Have we seen false Christ? Hallelujah. A lot of them is coming around. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Would deceive the very elected if it was possible. That's why I love the scripture. If it was possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not possible. No sir. The elected was ordained so they will not be deceived. You see what is the secret of this. Notice how that in Eden that Adam wasn't with Eve when she was dealing with the serpent. Right? &gt;&gt; As brother Bernham said, she cannot wait. But in the end time, the bride and the groom are already united together in marriage. &gt;&gt; And his mind is already in her. And the two have become one by the revelation of this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Eve was deceived because she cannot wait for her headship. But in these last days, praise God, the headship has come. &gt;&gt; Our headship is the word. Our headship is Christ and our protection AGAINST DECEPTION IS OUR head which is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 8, Ephesians church age 8. But we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of truth in the last days when the Lord is about to appear. The question now arises in our mind does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception. On no account the scripture says that very clearly in Matthew 24 that the elect cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; We cannot argue about that. &gt;&gt; It was already being declared. &gt;&gt; The elect cannot be deceived. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever situation you are in just go back to the word of God. If you are elect you need to claim it &gt;&gt; that you cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That your name is written in the book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Eve's protection against deception was her headship which was Adam. She did not have the capacity within herself. So the first little trick that was played on her She got hooked. &gt;&gt; Had she stayed behind her headship Adam instead of trying to reason things herself then the fall in Eden could never have taken place. &gt;&gt; But we understand that everything that comes that happens in order it is God's uh purpose to be &gt;&gt; express to express his attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So why will this last Eve not be deceived? Not because God has changed the makeup of the woman given her own ability to defend herself and withstand deception, but because she has come into her correct possession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Correct position of her headship in this hour under Christ the word. She has forsaken her risen and has taken on the mind of Christ by the revelation of the word in this day. So our protection from deception is our headship which is Christ the revealed word in this hour. We need to be in our headship because if we are not under the headship of the word we will be deceived. &gt;&gt; Notice in Genesis Eve did not involve Adam when dealing with the serpent. But in contrast this end time bride is not even talking to the serpent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. She is staying directly behind her husband who by the opening of the seventh seal has unveiled himself to her and has pated her with the seed of the original spoken word seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are already predated by the spoken word sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Part of what the seven sins reveal was to uncover the deception of how the antichrist has been deceiving the people since the time of Eve. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; By the white horse, by the red horse, by the black horse, by the pale horse. But since Satan's plan of deceit has now been uncovered in the bride, she now become an invisible army. Then his trick DON'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE THE truth has exposed him &gt;&gt; and wrote him powerless &gt;&gt; against the people of God. &gt;&gt; If the church know it condition and the move of God and the the antichrist and she knows who he was. &gt;&gt; You will become an invisible army in this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the access the access to true freedom and protection is by the receiving the headship of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And remaining in that position. &gt;&gt; Stay on your position. The only way to avoid becoming a part of the deception of this hour is to get into your position behind the word of God &gt;&gt; that has been revealed through the vindicated prophet that God has sent for this day. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ isn't deceived church by the word. &gt;&gt; She is an enlightened church by the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm uh calling our musicians to come. &gt;&gt; Serious. &gt;&gt; You want more? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I came, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want when we are in the church. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let us go church. Let us not stand as a flower base &gt;&gt; being tired and sleepy. Let us have church. So that's why I'm calling our musician to come. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need to save for Sunday &gt;&gt; so that our excitement will not dry out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to be excited every day. Amen. We need to hear the word. We need to be excited. &gt;&gt; Who will be the preacher by next Sunday? We need to pray. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Hallelujah. Because let's keep the fire. Hallelujah. Let's keep on the fire. The bride of Christ isn't deceived by the words. He is an enlightened church by the revelations of the word. &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with a word. &gt;&gt; And she does it in his name. She has. Thus, said the Lord. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mind of Christ was in you. SO WE HAVE THUS SAID THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Loud young churches. In this last day, there is again another people &gt;&gt; in the land who under the messenger will be the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; We become the final voice to the age. Because under our messenger, we become we did not BECOME A FINAL VOICE BY OUR own understanding. We become the final voice to arrange under our messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because we need to take the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO PROPHESY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So we become the final voice under our messenger. &gt;&gt; Not a messenger. NO OTHER MESSENGER. WE HAVE THE MESSENGER, THE CHRIST, THE ANGEL of the covenant. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HAS COME DOWN WITH AN OPEN BOOK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And he remained &gt;&gt; here. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In the last days, there is again another people in the land. Who is that another people? You and me. &gt;&gt; WE BECOME THE FINAL VOICE IN THE FINAL AGE UNDER OUR MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is its own mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; Give out the mouthpiece of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So God is turning on her. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What a great responsibility. GOD IS TURNING on her, the church, the bride, the elected. &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't belittle yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't don't pity the party. &gt;&gt; Oh, I am this, I am that. No. Go back to the word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO WHAT THE WORD PROMISE ABOUT YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO WHAT THE WORD REVEALED about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Just like Gideon, when the angel of the Lord goes to Gideon, I want you to deliver your people. He look at his shortcomings. &gt;&gt; I am the poorest of the poor. And maybe you mistaken me for somebody else. &gt;&gt; But the angel don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; HE KNOW EXACTLY THE TIME, the season, the age that you will be living. So that's why he sent Elijah to you. &gt;&gt; Not to them. To you &gt;&gt; to you sir. &gt;&gt; And you need TO CLAIM THAT YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT YOU. &gt;&gt; I AM the you. I AM THE ELECTED. I AM THE CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to claim the promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the promises is about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't claim it even though you are still in the midst of so much trial. &gt;&gt; That's okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Trial and testing is just to express God's attribute in our life. &gt;&gt; THE MORE TRIAL, THE MORE ATTRIBUTE will express from our life. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE MORE TRIAL we become humble, we become hallelujah. We become humble in wisdom and humility. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The mouthpiece of God it is. It's all mouthpiece. God is turning her. Not turning to others, &gt;&gt; turning to her. &gt;&gt; Who is that her? You and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. &gt;&gt; Just like Rahab when she received the spy &gt;&gt; before the judgment of Jericho, &gt;&gt; she received the word. &gt;&gt; She keep the word and she was given a token. &gt;&gt; Yes. When the judgment strike, you need to display the token &gt;&gt; and when receive the token will pass over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And during the TIME IN JERICHO, SHE WAS THE FINAL VOICE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF SOMEBODY WANTS salvations in Jericho, they need to seek Rahab &gt;&gt; because salvation is only IN RAHAB JUST LIKE WE ARE IN OUR DAY. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF THEY WANT SALVATION, IF THEY WANT DELIVERANCE, IT IS IN the voice &gt;&gt; of the bride in this last day, &gt;&gt; you need to feel it yourself. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T LET SOMEBODY EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU FEEL. YOU NEED TO FEEL IT. &gt;&gt; You make it personal. &gt;&gt; You need to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. Yes, it is. For his saints, in the last days of Revelation 17, the spirit and the bride say, "Come." &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; My Yeah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "That's good stuff." That's good stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm closing now. You got to be kidding me. That Eric, that was classic, man. What? You want more? Yeah. Come hungry, man. Don't be giving me just Don't give me a bone. GIVE ME A STEAK. &gt;&gt; KEEP PREACHING. AMEN. I love that. I love that. That was very, very good. &gt;&gt; Deception at the end time. All kinds of forms of deception. He goes in and the physical eye and that sort of thing. And then he takes that first woman in the first Eden. There it was one woman and she was and watch this. While she was separated from Adam &gt;&gt; because the brother Bram said Adam was her protection &gt;&gt; but she was out alone. &gt;&gt; Okay, this was after the separation. And when he found her alone, then he talked to her. And because she lusted for knowledge, &gt;&gt; and remember, thou shalt not eat of the tree of knowledge. Brother Bren said, watch those two trees. She lusted after the wrong thing. And the next thing you know, she was deceived. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Brother Brennham says, "Now watch what God does. He does the same thing in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; He chooses one woman Right? But she's not separated. She's been united again. &gt;&gt; So she can't be deceived. WHY? BECAUSE THE CHRIST THAT is in her will not see. Her headship is the word. AND SO SHE CANNOT BE DECEIVED. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit AND THE BRIDE HAVE BEEN UNITED. &gt;&gt; NO LONGER SEPARATED. THERE'S been an invisible union. &gt;&gt; Who have YOU BEEN UNITED TO? YOUR BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. BOY, I tell you what, &gt;&gt; that's action-packed, sir. &gt;&gt; I love it. I love to get excited about the word of God. &gt;&gt; You see the types and shadows and everything. Listen, you don't have to be worried, [music] you know, I'm going to be deceived or something. No. Hey, listen. If you're elect, you cannot [music] be deceived. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might be sidetracked. Yeah, that's happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? You might be sidetracked for it, but you know what he said? God is obligated to always bring you back. Keep the right attitude, the right spirit. I'd rather have the right spirit and the wrong doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because then God can correct me. We get this know-it-all spirit. And we, you know, I ah &gt;&gt; that's proud and arrogant. When you have the word, Brother Brim said, when that harvest is ripened and she's ready to be harvested, how can you tell? &gt;&gt; She bows her head. &gt;&gt; The more that I get closer to Christ, the more I bow my head and say, "It's &gt;&gt; it's him. &gt;&gt; It's all about him. Let's stand together." My We've had church tonight. Somebody give God some praise tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, um I believe there is an awakening right now and &gt;&gt; there's, you know, even the denominational churches, you know, I'm out there and I I see there's a lot of people that are coming to the Lord, you know, and they don't have the light that we have &gt;&gt; and they're hungry and they're looking for truth. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there'll be a famine in the last day. Not so much for bread and water. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But for the word of God and the true word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the water down the translated. Thank you, Lord, that he sent us truth. &gt;&gt; But I was at my barber and I've been going there for a while. And you [snorts] know, I'm not one of those guys that gets all caught up in the news, but he said uh he said, "Can you believe that New York voted in a Muslim?" And I thought, you know, I did hear that. I said, "Isn't that something after 911 you'd have thought that would have never happened?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But there's a lot of things that I've thought should have never happened that have happened. You know, &gt;&gt; that's true. &gt;&gt; And he said, you know, of the three candidates that were going for office, he said one of them had served prior and he didn't he didn't do very well, so they weren't going to vote for that guy. And then they said the other guy was a crooked guy and, you know, they didn't want somebody crooked in office. And this guy, this Muslim guy was wasn't really a bad guy. But he says, you know, the the overwhelming thing, he goes, I'm Jewish. And he goes, to see that the Jewish people of New York came together and they all voted for that Muslim, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I thought, why? You know, in my mind, I'm like, why? And he says, I've got family over there. And he goes, and I asked the same question. And he says that they said that the book says that the things at the end are going to be like this. you know, the good book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we just want to help it speed it along." [laughter] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Ted said it. We Why not vote for Camala Harris or you know, let's Lord, come quickly. &gt;&gt; We want to go home and he won't lose one of them. &gt;&gt; So, you know what? We are the voice. &gt;&gt; Tell him come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come. &gt;&gt; Come while Christ is still on the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; It's the return of the prodigals right now. &gt;&gt; He says they they want to see Elijah. They want to see Elijah come back. &gt;&gt; And so they said they're anxious. So they were trying to do what they can to help. And I thought, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; Bring the Muslims on." God bless you. [applause] Yeah. He said he said actually he said, "Look, let's get this guy in office. Let's kind of help this uh speed along, you know, let's fast forward this thing." And he said, "We're looking for Moses and Elijah, the two witnesses to come." So, they're looking for the restoration, but there's already been a restoration of the word. Can we say amen to that? Let's stand together. I tell you, praise God. Amen. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Lord, open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. Cuz when you see him, &gt;&gt; everything changed.
