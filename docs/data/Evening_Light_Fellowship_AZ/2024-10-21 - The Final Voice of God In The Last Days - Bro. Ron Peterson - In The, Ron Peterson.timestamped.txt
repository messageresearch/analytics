[45:33] pleasure to have you both here this
[45:35] morning amen volova that is the little
[45:38] village that we went to and and preached
[45:41] at many many years in fact excuse
[45:45] me that was the first time that ever
[45:47] preached a
[45:48] convention and that was the time Brother
[45:50] Floyd and brother Billy Paul and Brother
[45:52] Joseph were supposed to go and have the
[45:54] so we had uh Gone years ahead to go
[45:57] ahead and tell them hey they're coming
[45:59] they're uh we're going to have a East
[46:03] block convention and get all the
[46:05] Believers from the East block countries
[46:07] to come and so uh when we were in Norway
[46:12] with brother Hino bout camp we was with
[46:14] Louis's father uh and we got a call and
[46:18] Brother Floyd Patterson called up and
[46:20] said U brother Ron uh we're not able to
[46:23] come to the meetings because uh
[46:26] Chernobyl blew
[46:28] up and uh it was you know several
[46:31] hundred miles away from where if you
[46:34] look at a map of Poland he put a finger
[46:37] on the top right hand corner just below
[46:40] the Russian border that is where volova
[46:43] is that and and so anyway the the word
[46:47] had gotten that the Green Cloud had come
[46:50] down over and people were turning green
[46:52] and radioactive and and stuff and so
[46:55] they called and said hey they're not
[46:56] able to come say so would you uh would
[47:00] would you and brother hno go I never
[47:03] even thought about it well let me turn
[47:04] green let me get radioactive you know
[47:07] but I didn't think anything about it
[47:09] because we didn't have no cell phones
[47:10] and email and all that kind of stuff uh
[47:14] and so we went there and um when brother
[47:17] Hino and I we drove his car into the
[47:20] village there were flags and there were
[47:23] uh you know welcome signs and everything
[47:27] and uh they were so excited to have
[47:28] brother Billy Paul and Brother Joseph
[47:30] and Brother Floyd Patterson to to come
[47:32] and visit them and uh so as our car
[47:35] drove up they were coming out of the
[47:37] fields and all all of the Believers
[47:39] because volova was is basically a a
[47:43] whole village of
[47:44] Believers prise and so anyway they were
[47:47] just coming down and everything well
[47:49] brother Hino and I got out they were
[47:51] shaking our hand and looking past us
[47:54] like we're yeah brother H was it's good
[47:57] to see you brother Ron's good to see you
[47:59] where where's brother Billy and Brother
[48:02] Joseph we said uh well they they they
[48:06] couldn't make it unfortunately and stuff
[48:08] so anyway I remember I thought oh my
[48:11] because Brother Floyd said well you'll
[48:12] you'll have to help preach a convention
[48:14] so anyway I did
[48:17] and brother Hino and I we did a little
[48:20] tag team he and I back and forth and I
[48:23] had preached about three or four times I
[48:25] preached until I had nothing to
[48:28] preach I only took three services and I
[48:31] was done my resources of knowledge and
[48:36] everything I'd Learned was gone my tank
[48:39] was
[48:40] empty and I told Brother H know I said
[48:42] brother H know uh you know uh listen you
[48:46] tell the translator there that I'm done
[48:49] I I cannot
[48:51] preach and uh I I said I have nothing
[48:54] and so yes yes so they talk back and
[48:57] forth and everything and so I got up
[48:59] there and brother Hino got up and he he
[49:01] spoke about 15 20 minutes and hallelujah
[49:04] amen and I'm looking at my watch I'm
[49:06] saying oh good good we're going to get
[49:09] in the car and we're going to get going
[49:10] and we have to drive to Austria tonight
[49:13] so go through the borders and everything
[49:15] I'm thinking thank you hno short service
[49:18] let's go you know and and and so then uh
[49:22] brother Peter snon he he got up and was
[49:25] saying I don't speak Polish but I
[49:29] here and
[49:31] uh Ron Peterson and
[49:37] I so basically what he said well brother
[49:39] hno brought the appetizer now brother
[49:41] Ron is going to bring the entree and I I
[49:45] tell him didn't didn't you tell them
[49:49] well anyway so what happened and this is
[49:51] one of the greatest lessons I've had in
[49:54] life um I just said father right there
[49:58] on the front row cuz we were on the
[50:00] front row I said Lord you know that I've
[50:03] preached everything I
[50:05] know and I said I have not got anything
[50:08] to give I said you're going to have to
[50:10] come on the scene and help me Lord and I
[50:14] did Russian roulette with my
[50:17] Bible and I said okay wherever it opens
[50:21] to I'm going to preach right from there
[50:23] and it opened up to Deuteronomy
[50:25] Deuteronomy
[50:29] Deuteronomy who preaches out of
[50:32] Deuteronomy you know and so anyway I
[50:34] found the scripture excuse me it
[50:38] says for I have chosen you my people not
[50:41] because you are greater in number but
[50:42] because of my elective love and I knew
[50:46] right there I had it I knew I had a
[50:48] channel I preached I thought uh our
[50:51] services were over and about an hour and
[50:53] a half hour and 45 minutes later uh we
[50:56] we got done preaching I preached on
[50:58] God's elective love and uh we had a
[51:01] tremendous service in there and then I
[51:03] realized I realize father there comes a
[51:06] time when a minister he studies he does
[51:09] all this stuff and you can study too
[51:13] much and you can try to think well this
[51:15] is what I think the people need to
[51:17] hear and sometimes God just Waits until
[51:21] you're done he said are you done yeah
[51:24] yeah don't have nothing well okay can I
[51:27] speak yeah yeah that'd be good that'd be
[51:29] very good so that's how it started
[51:33] so uh it's kind of nice to have someone
[51:37] here from volova to be with us today
[51:40] goes back Roots it's like at the wedding
[51:44] let me just relax myself a moment here
[51:47] this morning when you go to a
[51:50] wedding and you see all of your old
[51:52] friends you think oh my look at time has
[51:54] gone by so quick all of the dark hair is
[51:57] now turned to Silver it's turned loose
[51:59] and and uh different things you see all
[52:02] these old people and you realize wow I'm
[52:06] I'm one of them I'm old too you know and
[52:10] uh but uh you know you think about it
[52:14] see wedding weddings have an attraction
[52:17] to bring people
[52:19] together there's another wedding that's
[52:21] taking place right now Hallelujah and
[52:24] that's bringing us together
[52:27] amen I don't want to have no excuse on
[52:29] that day of why I wasn't ready and
[52:30] wasn't preparing myself and I believe
[52:33] saints of God that it behooves us to
[52:36] understand our position in the body of
[52:39] Christ am and what part we play here in
[52:42] the end
[52:43] time and so I'd like you'd all to
[52:46] stand
[52:48] um let's sing only
[52:53] believe God sent a prophet
[52:57] his theme song was if you get the people
[52:59] to believe
[53:01] amen oh I've had things in my mind and
[53:04] maybe I have a hard time
[53:06] understanding but I've never
[53:09] disbelieved since the very first time I
[53:11] heard that prophet's voice there was
[53:14] some about I
[53:17] [Music]
[53:20] believe it's never
[53:23] changed I still say Lord
[53:27] I
[53:28] believe I believe regardless of what's
[53:31] going on around us and the people here
[53:33] and there and some that are leaving but
[53:36] father I'm not looking for a way out I'm
[53:39] looking for a way in amen let's sing
[53:42] this as we honor the Lord this morning

[54:47] we ever heard
[54:49] it had such a Melody had such a
[54:52] resonance that resounded within our
[54:55] hearts feeling a deep calling to the
[54:58] deep and father therefore if there's a
[55:00] deep calling there's a deep inside to
[55:03] respond father I thank you for your word
[55:07] I thank you for your Holy Spirit which
[55:09] leads us and guides
[55:11] us and brings us at a time in due season
[55:16] at an appointed time father realizing
[55:19] that that spiritual food that was stored
[55:22] up has now come to the time of being
[55:25] consumed consumed by the believer and
[55:28] that consumption of that word has gone
[55:31] from the tape into a living
[55:35] vessel praise the
[55:38] Lord there's a transformation taking
[55:43] place and the word is becoming
[55:46] flesh thank you father I pray that you
[55:49] take this word that you have put upon my
[55:52] heart anointed by your Holy Spirit

[57:01] 22:
[57:04] 16 through
[57:06] 21 I Jesus have sent mine Angel to
[57:10] testify unto you these things in the
[57:13] churches I am the root and offspring of
[57:17] David and the bright and morning
[57:21] star and the spirit and the bride say
[57:24] come let him that heareth say come and
[57:29] let him that is a thirst come and
[57:33] whosoever will let him take the Water of
[57:37] Life freely for I testify unto every man
[57:41] that Hearth the words of the prophecy of
[57:43] this
[57:44] book If any man shall add unto these
[57:48] things God shall add unto him the
[57:51] plagues that are written in this
[57:54] book and if any man shall take away from
[57:56] the words of the book of this prophecy
[58:01] God shall take away his part out of the
[58:03] book of life and out of the holy city
[58:06] and from the things which are written in
[58:08] this book and he which testifieth these
[58:13] things sayith surely I come quickly amen
[58:17] even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our
[58:21] Lord Jesus Christ be with you
[58:24] all amen amen amen Revelation 10 turning
[58:29] back into Revelation the 10th
[58:36] chapter Revelation chapter 10 very
[58:39] familiar portion of scripture but I wish
[58:42] to dissect it down just a wee bit for
[58:45] you this morning Revelation 10 verse 7-
[58:50] 11 but in the days of the voice of the
[58:53] seventh angel
[58:56] when he shall begin to
[58:58] sound brother Bram said not when he
[59:01] starts his
[59:04] ministry but when he begins to sound the
[59:07] Mysteries
[59:09] right the mystery of God should be
[59:12] finished a he has declared to his
[59:15] servants the prophets and the voice
[59:18] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[59:20] again and said go and take the little
[59:23] book which is open in the hand of the
[59:26] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[59:28] upon the
[59:29] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[59:33] unto him give me the little
[59:36] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[59:39] it up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[59:42] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[59:44] honey and I took the little book out of
[59:47] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[59:52] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[59:54] soon as I had eaten and it my belly was
[59:58] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:00:02] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:00:06] Nations and
[1:00:07] tongues and Kings may God bless the
[1:00:10] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:00:12] this morning in the presence of the
[1:00:17] Lord now I want you to notice that it
[1:00:20] was
[1:00:22] after the seventh angel messenger had
[1:00:25] finished
[1:00:28] and it was after that the mystery of God
[1:00:32] had been
[1:00:33] preached that the voice spoke to
[1:00:38] John and John is the type of the Bride
[1:00:40] so I want you to catch the correlation
[1:00:43] here take and eat the revealed
[1:00:48] word for it is spiritual food in due
[1:00:52] season John became obedient and he took
[1:00:55] and he ate atat the book he didn't just
[1:00:58] collect the tapes and books but he
[1:01:02] assimilated them by
[1:01:05] consumption what good is this message
[1:01:08] laying on a
[1:01:14] shelf it must be taken and
[1:01:17] consumed because whatever you consume
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:21] become Jesus said the words that I speak
[1:01:24] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:01:30] life it's not to just take these tapes
[1:01:33] and books and distribute
[1:01:37] them or not not just to say I agree with
[1:01:41] it you got to take it and eat it take
[1:01:44] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:01:47] you because thou must
[1:01:49] prophesy not the seventh angel now his
[1:01:53] ministry is over
[1:01:55] I want you to understand there's a
[1:01:57] change of
[1:01:59] administration it's not not the angel
[1:02:02] from heaven it's not the seventh angel
[1:02:06] but now the ministry is changing it's
[1:02:08] going to John John the voice that was
[1:02:13] Revelations 101 the mighty angel that
[1:02:17] voice quickened Revelations
[1:02:20] 107 and he preached the mystery of God
[1:02:23] but now John you've got to take this
[1:02:27] book you've got to take this message and
[1:02:30] like I preached this last couple
[1:02:33] Services about stepping into the vision
[1:02:36] this is not Creeds and dogmas and church
[1:02:39] order or the way to dress all those
[1:02:42] things are a part but this thing is
[1:02:44] actually a
[1:02:46] vision this is a vision from God because
[1:02:49] Prophet see they have that that Vision
[1:02:53] that comes from God and they they speak
[1:02:56] it because they're the mouthpiece of God
[1:02:58] Amen so it is a vision and when you take
[1:03:04] yourself and unite to this Vision what
[1:03:08] you're doing you're agreeing with it now
[1:03:12] watch this as it was with Mary so will
[1:03:16] it be with the bride I want you to
[1:03:18] understand that that angel was
[1:03:21] helpless to bring the promise to pass
[1:03:25] until she said with her voice be it unto
[1:03:29] me according to thy
[1:03:32] wordu I want all of you to understand
[1:03:34] this is not something that you just sit
[1:03:36] back and agree with it mentally but you
[1:03:40] in your heart say God let this prophecy
[1:03:45] let it be in my bosom let it be in my
[1:03:48] womb the womb of my mind and let it
[1:03:51] conceive and bring forth the life that
[1:03:54] it's supposed to bring forth overshadow
[1:03:56] me as you did
[1:04:01] Mary so now watch the voice of the
[1:04:05] mighty Angel transfers to the Earthly
[1:04:08] Angel the seventh angel and the voice
[1:04:12] and
[1:04:13] transfers to the voice of
[1:04:16] John it's the same God it's the same
[1:04:20] message but he's using another
[1:04:24] voice and I will would like to title my
[1:04:27] sermon this morning the final voice of
[1:04:30] God in the last
[1:04:33] days and I want to take a subject this
[1:04:36] morning of the bride's Ministry
[1:04:39] amen how many of you believe that you
[1:04:42] have been joined together with this
[1:04:45] message there's been a union an actual
[1:04:49] Union with it and therefore you've been
[1:04:53] United already with Christ
[1:04:57] thank you and so now that
[1:05:00] uniting has brought about a quickening
[1:05:03] or a transforming power to each one of
[1:05:06] you so you must Play Your
[1:05:09] Part it is not just saying verbally I
[1:05:13] agree with it but it's becoming one with
[1:05:16] it and so now we're in a time where the
[1:05:20] enemy is doing everything that he can to
[1:05:24] stop The Voice
[1:05:26] now brother Brenham said you may silence
[1:05:28] this voice one day and put it in the
[1:05:30] grave but you can never stop the message
[1:05:34] because the message is
[1:05:36] Christ
[1:05:38] amen so we're in the end time and the
[1:05:41] devil is doing all that he can to stop
[1:05:45] the final voice now like I said and I
[1:05:48] wish to substantiate this morning that
[1:05:51] the seventh angel is not the final voice
[1:05:56] right he's just a part of the
[1:06:01] formula he's part of the equation that
[1:06:04] God is using in this end time but his
[1:06:08] voice quickens another voice and your
[1:06:11] voice connected with that voice becomes
[1:06:14] the final
[1:06:16] voice amen so in the loud you see in
[1:06:20] church age brother Brenham said a
[1:06:23] momentary consideration of the church
[1:06:26] history will prove how accurate this
[1:06:29] thought is in the Dark Ages the word was
[1:06:32] almost entirely lost to the people but
[1:06:36] God sent Luther with the word and the
[1:06:40] lutherans Not Just
[1:06:42] Luther not just the messenger the
[1:06:45] lutherans spoke for God at that time but
[1:06:49] they organized and again the pure word
[1:06:52] was lost for organization tends to
[1:06:55] wordss dogma and Creeds and not simple
[1:06:58] word amen they could no longer speak for
[1:07:01] God then God sent Wesley and he was the
[1:07:05] voice with the word in his day and the
[1:07:09] people who took the Revelation from God
[1:07:12] became the living Epistles read and
[1:07:15] known of all
[1:07:16] men for their generation are you seeing
[1:07:19] this
[1:07:20] pattern and when the Methodist failed
[1:07:23] God raised up others so it has gone on
[1:07:26] on through the years until the last day
[1:07:30] there is again another people in the
[1:07:33] land who under their messenger amen you
[1:07:37] understand it who under their messenger
[1:07:39] because we realize God sent a prophet
[1:07:41] he's our messenger we're not looking for
[1:07:44] an eighth messenger we've had the
[1:07:46] seventh messenger but we're looking now
[1:07:49] for another to take that same word watch
[1:07:53] this who under their messenger
[1:07:56] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:08:00] I'm sorry to disagree with others who
[1:08:02] say to stay home and press play because
[1:08:05] they stop right there at the prophet's
[1:08:08] voice and they deny another voice that
[1:08:11] is supposed to come they deny the word
[1:08:13] of God and the word of God will be
[1:08:16] completed and I say God be it unto us
[1:08:19] according to Thy
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:24] word amen
[1:08:26] in Exodus
[1:08:28] 23: 20- 24 the prophet of God uses this
[1:08:33] scripture in 14 different
[1:08:36] sermons and he says behold I send an
[1:08:38] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:08:42] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:08:44] which I have prepared beware of him and
[1:08:47] obey his word excuse me his voice
[1:08:51] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[1:08:53] your transgressions for in my my name is
[1:08:56] in
[1:08:58] him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his
[1:09:02] voice and do all that I
[1:09:04] speak then I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:09:08] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[1:09:12] adversaries for my angel shall go before
[1:09:15] thee and bring thee into the
[1:09:17] amorites and the Hittites and the
[1:09:20] perizzites and the
[1:09:22] Canaanites and the hites and the
[1:09:24] jebusites and I will will cut them
[1:09:26] off Thou shalt not bow down to their
[1:09:30] gods nor serve them nor do after their
[1:09:34] works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow
[1:09:37] them and quite break down their images
[1:09:42] brother Brenham uses this sermon
[1:09:46] text for 14 different
[1:09:49] messages emphasizing that when God sends
[1:09:52] a messenger you must obey
[1:09:55] his his voice
[1:09:59] amen God has always had voed
[1:10:02] representation on
[1:10:04] Earth he's done it from the very time in
[1:10:07] the Garden of Eden God has always had a
[1:10:10] Believer
[1:10:11] somewhere that he could use as his voice
[1:10:15] and when the prophet left the scene God
[1:10:17] was already raising up another one not
[1:10:20] one as in singular but one as in body
[1:10:26] now John was commanded to take the book
[1:10:28] of redemption a and to eat it up and
[1:10:32] after he partook of the message revealed
[1:10:34] in his hour it was his turn to speak
[1:10:38] thou must prophesy unto the people it
[1:10:41] wasn't the seventh angel now prophesying
[1:10:43] it was John it was the bride brother
[1:10:47] sister we have a duty to do in this end
[1:10:51] time we are to have the word of God
[1:10:53] being consumed inside of of us and then
[1:10:57] that consuming now consumes us and it's
[1:11:01] not you it's the word in you now living
[1:11:04] out making a manifestation of Christ in
[1:11:07] this hour
[1:11:10] hallelujah thank you Lord just as John
[1:11:14] was commanded to take the book so we are
[1:11:16] commanded in this hour to get into these
[1:11:19] tapes and books that's why I tell all of
[1:11:21] you you listen to these tapes they do
[1:11:24] not replace going to
[1:11:26] Church you go to church you forsake not
[1:11:29] the assembling of the Brethren together
[1:11:31] but you at home you listen those tapes
[1:11:34] you read the books and you get into it
[1:11:38] and you consume it and you will watch
[1:11:41] that the more of the light you receive
[1:11:44] the more of the light of God comes out
[1:11:46] of
[1:11:47] you the word will be living out of
[1:11:51] you the Bible says Revelation 22:17 and
[1:11:55] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:11:58] notice now the spirit and the bride are
[1:12:00] both now saying the same thing this is
[1:12:03] the hour and the time when we have
[1:12:05] joined our voice with the spirit and now
[1:12:10] they're saying the same thing watch this
[1:12:13] now in the true Easter seal brother
[1:12:15] Braham said if you notice as soon as the
[1:12:17] voice of Abel was silent in death God
[1:12:21] raised up Seth to take his place which
[1:12:24] was nothing but a preaster a pre-
[1:12:26] resurrection or a replacement until the
[1:12:29] resurrection
[1:12:31] came that went on for a while down
[1:12:34] through the Old Testament we find it
[1:12:36] going the prophets God kept his voice
[1:12:39] alive with the prophets they spake the
[1:12:42] word of God and they stoned them and as
[1:12:44] soon as they would Stone one and put him
[1:12:47] away God would raise up another one and
[1:12:51] they'd stol that one and put away and
[1:12:53] God had raise up another one he's always
[1:12:56] kept his witness
[1:12:57] alive down Through the Ages he's kept
[1:13:00] the voice alive before the people all
[1:13:04] the way from Eden amen I believe that
[1:13:08] just as God has kept a voice and a
[1:13:11] representation in every age and in every
[1:13:14] hour we are not to just look back to the
[1:13:18] voice of the seventh angel and say oh I
[1:13:21] wish I would have been there I wished I
[1:13:23] would have been in the meetings no we
[1:13:25] have those tapes and we can listen to it
[1:13:29] and we get into it but that voice did
[1:13:31] not stop when he went off the scene in
[1:13:35] 1965 that voice
[1:13:38] continues amen it's a
[1:13:43] transformation it is now entering now
[1:13:46] into another Administration who is it
[1:13:49] it's the
[1:13:51] bride she's coming to it Jesus said I
[1:13:55] have many things I wanted to say unto
[1:13:57] you but you could not bear them now how
[1:14:01] be it after I'm Gone the holy spirit
[1:14:05] will bring all these things to your
[1:14:07] attention and you'll begin to understand
[1:14:11] hallelujah we're we're now at the time
[1:14:14] where all of these tapes and books and
[1:14:16] this prophetic word had been preached
[1:14:20] but now we're coming to the
[1:14:21] understanding of why he preached it you
[1:14:24] see years ago
[1:14:26] in the early 70s when I first came into
[1:14:28] the message it was prophet Prophet
[1:14:30] Prophet Revelations 10 Hallelujah
[1:14:34] Prophet Prophet prophet and for years
[1:14:38] you go to a convention and everybody say
[1:14:40] well now God sent a prophet Hallelujah
[1:14:43] and we all got
[1:14:44] excited but once you've understood God
[1:14:47] sent a prophet that doesn't stimulate
[1:14:50] you anymore say what he said tell me
[1:14:54] what he said
[1:14:57] said so now we're at the time the
[1:15:01] prophet has come and gone that's right
[1:15:04] he's preached his ministry his Earthly
[1:15:08] Ministry is
[1:15:10] over yet I believe the voice is still
[1:15:14] continuing I believe the same voice of
[1:15:18] inspiration that was in William branam
[1:15:21] is now coming into the bride it's the
[1:15:25] Holy Spirit and now that Holy Spirit is
[1:15:28] taking another voice and
[1:15:31] she will be the final voice to the final
[1:15:36] age you can't make it any other way
[1:15:38] that's
[1:15:42] right brother Brenham says in the voice
[1:15:45] of God
[1:15:47] 63 you might not to get a chance tonight
[1:15:50] you
[1:15:51] might not get a chance tomorrow it's now
[1:15:55] now when you hear my voice Harden not
[1:15:58] your heart in the days of
[1:16:00] provocation now is the time this is the
[1:16:04] acceptable
[1:16:05] time that if any man will hear my voice
[1:16:10] that goes so show that his voice would
[1:16:13] still be there in the midst of all the
[1:16:16] chaos somebody say Amen to that thank
[1:16:19] you Lord he's still got a voice why his
[1:16:23] voice will remain
[1:16:26] here it is Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:16:28] away but my voice shall not pass away
[1:16:32] his word amen now Ezekiel catches this
[1:16:35] also I wish to share this with
[1:16:38] you he says in Ezekiel
[1:16:41] 43:2 and behold the glory of the god of
[1:16:44] Israel came from the way of the East and
[1:16:48] his voice was like the noise of many
[1:16:52] Waters and the Earth shined
[1:16:55] with his glory so here was the glory of
[1:16:59] God coming to
[1:17:01] Israel it was coming from the East going
[1:17:05] west because the as the sun rises in the
[1:17:08] East and sets in the west so does the
[1:17:10] glory of God's word it came in the East
[1:17:14] it's now keep going westward westward
[1:17:17] and his voice was like the noise of many
[1:17:20] Waters now John on the aisle of patmas
[1:17:24] picks this up in Revelation 1 in
[1:17:28] Revelation
[1:17:29] 1:2 I turned to see the voice that spake
[1:17:32] with me now he's hearing a
[1:17:35] voice I turned to see this voice and
[1:17:39] being turned I saw seven golden
[1:17:42] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:17:44] seven candlesticks one like the son of
[1:17:47] man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:17:50] foot his and gird about the PS with a
[1:17:53] golden girdle his head and his hair were
[1:17:57] white like
[1:17:58] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[1:18:02] as a flame of fire his feet were like
[1:18:05] fine brass as if they burned in a
[1:18:08] firness and his voice as the sound of
[1:18:12] many Waters and he had in his right hand
[1:18:16] Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a
[1:18:19] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:18:21] countenance was as the sun shineth in it
[1:18:24] strength I want you to notice he had
[1:18:27] seven stars and in his right hand there
[1:18:30] were seven stars and this seventh angel
[1:18:34] the seventh angel messenger that we know
[1:18:36] is the Star Messenger to this age and
[1:18:40] his ministry was Vindicated there uh
[1:18:45] there in Sabino Canyon when he was there
[1:18:49] praying about a vision now I want you to
[1:18:51] understand he's had Visions about God
[1:18:54] coming to him he's seen seven Mighty
[1:18:57] Angels he's got all the he's heard an
[1:18:59] explosion he's wondering what does this
[1:19:01] mean does it mean you're taking me off
[1:19:04] the scene I if so that's fine but he's
[1:19:07] up there oh God what does this vision
[1:19:09] mean and all of a sudden he said
[1:19:12] something hit my hand what was it a
[1:19:16] sword it wasn't a king sword it was the
[1:19:19] king sword what God was
[1:19:21] doing he said this is not the end of
[1:19:24] your ministry this is the Vindication of
[1:19:28] your ministry this is the third pole the
[1:19:32] third pole is that sharp two-edged sword
[1:19:35] which divides aunder between spirit and
[1:19:39] soul it is the word that separates us
[1:19:42] from all unbelief somebody say Amen to
[1:19:50] that God is still using the voice of the
[1:19:53] ministry
[1:19:55] amen amen but not only the
[1:19:59] ministry but to who they are ministering
[1:20:04] to and when your voice blends with other
[1:20:09] voices it becomes the sound of many
[1:20:13] Waters Amen brother Brenham says what
[1:20:15] does this sound of many Waters mean in
[1:20:19] the patmas vision now I I tell you
[1:20:22] everything about this message is God
[1:20:25] revealing that Prophet through vision so
[1:20:29] here he is talking about this patas
[1:20:31] Vision that John has brother Brenham
[1:20:33] catches by the revelation of the angel
[1:20:36] coming to him and he's understanding
[1:20:38] these symbols so watch this I for the
[1:20:43] sake of time I'm just going to read the
[1:20:45] highlighted portion the sound of many
[1:20:47] Waters voice of many Waters what does
[1:20:51] Waters
[1:20:52] represent if you want to Market downturn
[1:20:55] to Revelation
[1:20:57] 17:15 see the waters which thou saw is
[1:21:00] thickness multitudes people and tongues
[1:21:03] all right he says now the voice of many
[1:21:06] Waters what is his voice it's the
[1:21:10] Judgment the voice of the ministers
[1:21:13] through the Holy Spirit that's cried out
[1:21:16] to the people in every age standing
[1:21:18] there the voice of many Waters Cried Out
[1:21:21] thickness and multitudes The Voice of
[1:21:24] those seven stars in his hand to every
[1:21:26] Church age preaching the baptism of the
[1:21:29] Holy Ghost baptism in jesus' name
[1:21:33] speaking in tongues the power of God the
[1:21:36] resurrection of Christ the second coming
[1:21:38] Divine judgment the voice of many Waters
[1:21:41] coming forth from this one that looked
[1:21:44] like the son of man many Waters you see
[1:21:48] my brother my sister it is a nickan
[1:21:51] spirit which tries to silence The Voice
[1:21:54] of the ministry
[1:21:56] today that's
[1:22:00] right it would be you see the
[1:22:04] devil would love for you to just stop at
[1:22:07] that voice of the seventh
[1:22:10] angel because then it gives you no no
[1:22:14] purpose it gives you no placy it gives
[1:22:17] you no Ministry yourself you're not
[1:22:19] being united with the vision you're just
[1:22:21] saying okay well praise the Lord God
[1:22:24] sent a prophet and he did Miracles and
[1:22:26] signs and it was so great and the
[1:22:28] Messiah sign and everything but my
[1:22:31] brother my sister the voice does not
[1:22:34] stop with Revelations

[1:22:40] Waters praise the Lord there's more
[1:22:44] people believ in this message today than
[1:22:46] when brother Brandon was here preaching
[1:22:51] it he would have died a brokenhearted
[1:22:54] Pro ET there was very few men that were
[1:22:58] catching any kind of
[1:23:00] Revelation really to substantiate that
[1:23:04] this was an end time
[1:23:09] message oh a few men they saw he he had
[1:23:12] a great gift even brother Billy Paul
[1:23:15] said brother Ron it wasn't until after
[1:23:17] Daddy went off of the scene that I
[1:23:19] realized he was the seventh angel
[1:23:22] messenger you were so close to it you're
[1:23:25] so close to him you just saw the human
[1:23:28] element oh my sometimes we get so close
[1:23:31] to one another we get so close to this
[1:23:34] message of God that it just becomes
[1:23:36] common to us my brother my sister we
[1:23:39] should realize that God has sent in this
[1:23:42] end time a message to us that we've got
[1:23:45] to not just talk about it not just read
[1:23:48] it but to get into it step into the

[1:24:51] same works that I do shall you do also
[1:24:55] there is a successor there is
[1:24:59] someone that will carry on the ministry
[1:25:03] amen thank you paman Church age notice
[1:25:06] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:25:08] Jesus never did anything and it was
[1:25:10] first showed him by the Father John 5:19
[1:25:14] this harmony is now to
[1:25:16] exist between the groom and his bride
[1:25:21] amen he shows her his Word of Life life
[1:25:24] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:25:27] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:25:29] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:25:32] water will raise it up again here is the
[1:25:36] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:25:39] as it was in
[1:25:41] Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:25:45] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:25:47] the
[1:25:48] word she performs the command of the
[1:25:51] word in his name for she has thus sayeth
[1:25:55] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[1:25:57] the spirit and it comes to pass like a
[1:26:00] seed that is planted in water it comes
[1:26:03] to full Harvest serving is purpose next
[1:26:07] paragraph those in the bride do only his
[1:26:10] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:26:14] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:26:16] keep
[1:26:17] still they know that it has to be God in
[1:26:20] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:26:23] word did not complete all his work while
[1:26:26] his Earthly
[1:26:28] Ministry in his Earthly Ministry so now
[1:26:33] he works in and through the
[1:26:36] bride are you catching
[1:26:39] this it didn't stop with the seventh
[1:26:42] angel
[1:26:44] messenger he says he did not complete
[1:26:48] all his Works while in his Earthly
[1:26:51] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:26:55] the bride amen she knows that for it was
[1:27:00] not yet time for him to do certain
[1:27:02] things that he must do
[1:27:04] now now do but he will now fulfill
[1:27:08] through the bride that work that he
[1:27:12] left for this specific
[1:27:17] time how many believe that we're in an
[1:27:20] appointed time right
[1:27:21] now there are times and seasons

[1:27:26] itself we see it we're entering now into
[1:27:29] the fall of our season we see it we see
[1:27:31] the leaves changing we see uh things
[1:27:35] happening here on the earth we know that
[1:27:37] it's the fall of the year because we see
[1:27:39] certain things in a physical
[1:27:41] manifestation around us so it is now
[1:27:44] also among the
[1:27:46] bride we're coming into the season where
[1:27:49] we must be mature bride no longer tossed
[1:27:52] about to control by every wind of

[1:28:51] guys getting this
[1:28:54] he represents the end time leader that
[1:28:57] will come to the church even as Paul
[1:28:59] came to the original leader as the
[1:29:03] original Caleb represents those who
[1:29:05] stayed true with
[1:29:08] Joshua so you have the end time leader
[1:29:12] and you have a Caleb who stays true to
[1:29:15] Joshua praise the Lord remember God had
[1:29:18] started Israel as a virgin with his word
[1:29:21] but they wanted something different so
[1:29:22] did this last day church now
[1:29:26] notice how God did not move Israel or
[1:29:30] let her go into the promised land until
[1:29:32] it was his appointed time now the people
[1:29:37] might have put pressure on Joshua the
[1:29:40] leader and said the land is ours let's
[1:29:43] go take it
[1:29:44] Joshua you are all through you must have
[1:29:47] lost your commission you don't have the
[1:29:49] power you used to you used to hear from
[1:29:52] God and know the will of God God and act
[1:29:54] quickly something is wrong with
[1:29:57] you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet
[1:30:01] and he knew that the promises of God so
[1:30:03] he waited for them he waited for a
[1:30:05] clear-cut decision from God and when the
[1:30:08] time come to move God placed the full
[1:30:12] leadership in Joshua's hands because he
[1:30:14] had stayed with the
[1:30:16] word God could trust Joshua but not the
[1:30:20] others so it will repeat in the end day
[1:30:25] the same
[1:30:26] problem same pressures so we're seeing
[1:30:30] the same thing repeating but if we see
[1:30:33] those things we're also realizing there
[1:30:36] must be a successor to this end time
[1:30:40] voice there must be somebody who catches
[1:30:43] the
[1:30:44] Baton I don't know if you've ever
[1:30:46] watched the relay race and you have
[1:30:50] Runners and usually the fastest Sprinter
[1:30:53] they put at the end time they put him at
[1:30:56] the end and you have a good Sprinter
[1:31:00] there they're all good sprinters and
[1:31:01] they running and stuff and if you've
[1:31:04] ever watched him pass the Baton a lot of
[1:31:07] times the man is not standing there
[1:31:10] waiting for him to come and he hands him
[1:31:12] the Baton but as he sees the runner
[1:31:15] approaching he starts to get into stride
[1:31:19] and he realizes and he's not looking
[1:31:22] like this no he's running running and
[1:31:24] when he runs he's putting one hand
[1:31:28] back that when they get stride for
[1:31:31] stride the next day it hits his hand and
[1:31:34] you see he the Baton is now passed to
[1:31:37] the one in front of him
[1:31:40] Hallelujah when we start catching the
[1:31:44] stride of the ones that have been
[1:31:46] running with this spaton when you
[1:31:49] realize it's not a time to get all uh
[1:31:51] it's not a time to stand there and say
[1:31:53] well come on come on come on hurry up
[1:31:55] give it to me no start running start
[1:31:57] running he's going to catch up to you
[1:31:59] pass the Baton and then you run if we've
[1:32:02] ever had a time to run let's run let's
[1:32:05] run now the Baton is passed it's our job
[1:32:09] to run
[1:32:11] you if you can't preach the sermon live
[1:32:15] the
[1:32:22] sermon John 14:12 says verily I say unto
[1:32:26] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:32:30] that I do also shall he do and greater
[1:32:33] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:32:35] go to the father we see this pattern now
[1:32:39] developing John was the voice of God
[1:32:43] crying right John was the voice crying
[1:32:47] in the wilderness then come another
[1:32:50] voice the voice of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:54] after he was gone come another voice the
[1:32:57] voice of the
[1:32:58] disciples are you seeing the voice never
[1:33:02] stops he's always got a representation
[1:33:04] and just about the time when he when he
[1:33:06] may take one off the scene they either
[1:33:09] kill him destroy them Stone them do
[1:33:11] something or they die a natural death
[1:33:15] then the devil says aha I've stopped the
[1:33:17] voice oh no let me tell you you never
[1:33:21] stop this voice The Voice will continue
[1:33:23] you why if it's God's voice you can't
[1:33:26] kill
[1:33:28] God prise the Lord you can't stop his
[1:33:31] voice The Voice
[1:33:39] continues
[1:33:46] amen now I want you to notice that the
[1:33:49] prophet's
[1:33:51] Ministry when he enters into the Third
[1:33:53] PA it's not to the
[1:33:57] multitudes it Narrows down
[1:34:02] amen he changes his
[1:34:04] ministry when he does it becomes
[1:34:06] offensive except you eat of My Flesh you
[1:34:09] see you got to eat the
[1:34:11] word you got to eat that flesh word
[1:34:13] we're not feeding upon William Brandon
[1:34:15] we're feeding on the unfilling word body
[1:34:18] of Jesus Christ that's right take eat
[1:34:20] this
[1:34:21] body amen but the ministry was narrowed
[1:34:26] down actually the ministry got greater
[1:34:29] but the crowd got
[1:34:30] smaller the vision got more intense but
[1:34:33] the people became a smaller
[1:34:40] group the big revivals with all the
[1:34:43] multitudes is over first and second
[1:34:46] polls ended brother Brenham preaching he
[1:34:49] says oh look at the clock turn around
[1:34:52] and look it's 2:00 sh you the second
[1:34:54] pull is over the third pull is at hand
[1:34:57] he said you all know what the third pull
[1:34:59] is he says it's the word being revealed
[1:35:03] in its season and he says and you what
[1:35:05] you've caught temporarily now you when
[1:35:09] you begin to see The Squeeze come on let
[1:35:11] me tell you if there's ever a time of a
[1:35:13] squeeze it's now amen we're seeing it
[1:35:15] you're feeling a pressure from all
[1:35:17] around hell is emptying itself out the
[1:35:20] devil and all of his subjects and the
[1:35:23] prince of the power of the air
[1:35:24] everything is there's pressure there's
[1:35:26] pressure in your work there's pressure
[1:35:28] in politics there's pressure in
[1:35:30] economics there's pressure somebody say
[1:35:32] pressure pressure amen that's right
[1:35:36] brother RM said pressure will make you
[1:35:38] do things that you don't want to
[1:35:41] do God help us to be
[1:35:46] pressurized amen that who cares all this
[1:35:49] stuff well if if Cala gets in or if if
[1:35:53] Trump gets in let me tell you it ain't
[1:35:57] about Trump and it ain't about Kamar
[1:36:00] it's about the word of God coming to
[1:36:01] pass in the end time and whoever it is
[1:36:04] and however it comes to pass I don't
[1:36:07] care all I say is I want to be a part of
[1:36:10] the voice of God in this end time and no
[1:36:13] man can take my place no man can shut me
[1:36:18] out the
[1:36:20] Lord do you guys remember the Elijah
[1:36:23] tried to shake Elisha off you remember
[1:36:26] that remember that in second Kings
[1:36:29] chapter 2 where he came and the Lord
[1:36:32] would take Elijah up into heaven in a
[1:36:35] whirlwind and Elijah went with Elisha to
[1:36:42] gilgal and he said Elisha Terry
[1:36:47] here the Lord has sent me to
[1:36:50] bethl well guess what Elisha says say
[1:36:53] the Lord God liveth I'm not going to
[1:36:55] stay here I'm going with
[1:36:58] you prise the
[1:37:02] Lord he tells him three times T here
[1:37:06] first second third pull T here as the
[1:37:09] Lord God liveth see he says as my soul
[1:37:13] liveth I will not leave thee and then
[1:37:15] the 50 sons of the prophets come out to
[1:37:18] to uh to to meet Elisha and they stood a
[1:37:21] far off and they said don't you realize
[1:37:23] your head's being taken away from you
[1:37:24] shut your
[1:37:26] mouth don't matter sons of the
[1:37:29] prophets are you kidding me there's all
[1:37:32] kinds of voices in this end time amen
[1:37:35] you realize you got to do this you got
[1:37:37] to do that listen there's one
[1:37:39] voice there's one voice that is ordained
[1:37:42] of God to turn your hearts back that is
[1:37:46] the voice of the seventh angel but the
[1:37:48] voice does not stop
[1:37:50] there it
[1:37:52] continues it continues and guess what
[1:37:56] Elijah said what what do you want from
[1:37:59] me what have I done to you I don't know
[1:38:03] but I tell you what when I was out there

[1:38:22] this prophet's message it did something
[1:38:24] to you yeah you thought you could go and
[1:38:27] continue plowing with your oxen no you
[1:38:30] know what what have you

[1:38:38] me what do you want what do you want
[1:38:39] from me come on he said I want a double
[1:38:42] portion of what you got oh you do do

[1:39:42] of beginning you realize every Ministry

[1:39:49] somewhere gilgal was the point of
[1:39:51] beginning of Elijah's minist

[1:44:31] here and he made a mistake over there
[1:44:34] well I'll give you a quote brother Ram
[1:44:37] says I can show you by the word of God
[1:44:38] all the prophets made their
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:43] mistakes he says but God makes no
[1:44:46] mistakes you know what's you know what's
[1:44:48] so amazing is when he gave Abraham a
[1:44:52] covenant
[1:44:53] and it was
[1:44:54] unconditional right it don't matter from
[1:44:58] that time on the mistakes he
[1:45:02] makes he can lie and give us a wife away
[1:45:05] and guess what the Covenant stayed right
[1:45:07] there he could
[1:45:10] lie and says that's my sister Covenant
[1:45:13] stayed right there Hallelujah do you see
[1:45:15] when when you got that unconditional
[1:45:18] Covenant like your father Abraham you
[1:45:20] might make mistakes and you will yeah
[1:45:23] every one of you put your Halo away for
[1:45:25] a moment and realize you're human beings
[1:45:28] but you have a covenant with God that
[1:45:32] when you make a mistake he's there right
[1:45:34] there you have a
[1:45:36] mediator Hallelujah I'm not looking at
[1:45:39] my mistakes I'm looking at the
[1:45:42] [Applause]
[1:45:47] promise every one of
[1:45:50] them they all made their mistakes but
[1:45:53] God makes no
[1:45:55] mistakes praise the
[1:45:57] Lord disciples stood to test see a
[1:46:00] Ministry is not formed

[1:50:18] long-haired guy came and they start
[1:50:20] witnessing to him he said oh I'm a
[1:50:22] Christian I'm a Christian and you know
[1:50:24] and so they start witnessing to him and

[1:50:30] hair and he said yeah I'm ashamed so
[1:50:32] what
[1:50:36] else I'm ashamed so what else you want

[1:51:27] had been dealing with me about my long
[1:51:29] hair so I was sitting there shaking my

[1:58:59] know that predestination is an election
[1:59:02] from God and those
[1:59:06] that have the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:59:09] have the spirit of
[1:59:12] Prophecy and I said would you open his
[1:59:14] eyes to this and we put the tape on and
[1:59:18] I'm just praying for Mitch that's all
[1:59:24] when we got done with the tape I looked
[1:59:26] over at HIM Tears was coming down his
[1:59:29] face and he said brother
[1:59:32] Ron I know he's a prophet
[1:59:40] amen he says I can tell by the
[1:59:44] voice praise the Lord little did we know
[1:59:46] and I just saw Mitch up at the up at the
[1:59:50] wedding Mitch is
[1:59:53] 72 I'm
[1:59:57] 71 we're still serving the
[1:59:59] lord we still going
[2:00:03] on Mitch's mother came to my mother and
[2:00:05] said what did your boys do to brainwash
[2:00:09] my
[2:00:10] son I said well I don't think it was my
[2:00:13] sons that brainwashed your son but I
[2:00:17] don't know even what my children my boys
[2:00:20] are believing that I know this
[2:00:23] I don't think they brainwashed your son
[2:00:26] to believe what he
[2:00:33] believes now let me ask you a
[2:00:36] question do you believe that the Bride
[2:00:39] of Jesus Christ will have a Ministry
[2:00:42] before the
[2:00:46] Rapture so let me show you this quote
[2:00:49] here questions answers 19
[2:00:52] 63 would the bride of Christ have a
[2:00:56] Ministry before the
[2:00:59] Rapture
[2:01:01] sure what's going on right
[2:01:04] now see the bride of Christ certainly
[2:01:07] it's the message of the
[2:01:09] hour do do you realize the message of
[2:01:11] the hour is the
[2:01:13] ministry of the
[2:01:17] Bride amen it's a message of th see the
[2:01:19] bride of Christ sure she can consists of
[2:01:23] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[2:01:26] and pastors is that right that's the
[2:01:28] bride of Christ sure she's got a
[2:01:30] Ministry great ministry it's the
[2:01:32] ministry of the hour it'll be so
[2:01:36] humble amen musicians have you come I'm
[2:01:39] bringing this to a
[2:01:45] close it'll be a great ministry amen but
[2:01:49] it'll be humble
[2:01:53] so if we stop with the voice of the
[2:01:55] seventh angel and that's his
[2:01:58] ministry then the devil has got us to
[2:02:01] where we don't go into our position
[2:02:03] right do you see that
[2:02:06] amen I never asked God to make me a
[2:02:11] minister never asked God to make me a
[2:02:16] pastor I know this that ever since that
[2:02:18] I came into this
[2:02:19] message and my eyes came open open to
[2:02:22] it I love
[2:02:26] it I do and yeah I took my kids Amos is
[2:02:31] not here and my daughter Rebecca is here
[2:02:34] right now and Amos is down in Mexico and
[2:02:37] Matt he's not
[2:02:48] here I wanted my kids to see it so bad
[2:02:54] I made him tow the line
[2:02:59] yeah you're not going to do that while
[2:03:02] you're in my house as for me in my house
[2:03:05] will serve the
[2:03:07] Lord so I drug them to
[2:03:10] church I drug them to
[2:03:13] conventions they all had a drug problem
[2:03:15] because they got drug here and
[2:03:17] there I say that as a
[2:03:20] joke but apple don't fall far from the
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:36] tree sometimes we as parents want our
[2:03:39] kids to see it so
[2:03:41] badly while you're in my
[2:03:43] house you will do what I do and you will
[2:03:46] go where I go and when you get old
[2:03:50] enough then you can go do your thing but
[2:03:52] while you're here in this
[2:03:57] house did I become a little too
[2:04:00] legalistic yes I
[2:04:02] did because I thought that my Revelation
[2:04:05] would be good enough for them also it's
[2:04:08] not no they need their own
[2:04:12] Revelation and when they catch it guess
[2:04:14] what you don't have to tell them what to
[2:04:16] do he tells them what to do praise God
[2:04:23] in 2 Timothy 2:2 it says and the things
[2:04:26] that thou has heard of me among many
[2:04:29] witnesses the same commit thou to
[2:04:31] Faithful
[2:04:32] Men Who Shall be able to teach others
[2:04:38] also brother ran picks this up in saman
[2:04:41] church age in every age we have exactly
[2:04:44] the same
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:47] pattern that is why the light comes
[2:04:50] through some god-given
[2:04:52] messenger in a certain area and then
[2:04:54] from that messenger there spreads the
[2:04:56] light through the ministry of others who
[2:04:58] have been Faithfully
[2:05:01] taught the light comes to others who's
[2:05:04] been
[2:05:05] Faithfully taught amen but of course all
[2:05:09] those who go out don't always learn how
[2:05:11] necessary to speak only what the
[2:05:14] messenger has
[2:05:16] spoken then he talks about Paul in 1
[2:05:18] Corinthians 14
[2:05:22] how important it is at the bottom of
[2:05:24] that paragraph to hear the voice of God
[2:05:26] by way of The Messengers and then say
[2:05:29] what has been given them to say to the
[2:05:32] churches it's essential that every
[2:05:35] Minister be Faithfully taught
[2:05:37] first in every career in every
[2:05:40] occupation you have an apprenticeship
[2:05:43] you don't want to be a carpenter four
[2:05:46] years apprenticeship you want to be a
[2:05:49] journeyman electrician four years
[2:05:51] apprentic ship you anything you got an
[2:05:53] apprenticeship you got to know what to
[2:05:56] do on the
[2:05:59] job you got to be Faithfully taught CU
[2:06:02] you don't come to the top pay scale and
[2:06:04] go out here and start wiring things up
[2:06:06] you don't even know does the red go with
[2:06:09] the black and the white where does it go
[2:06:11] where and all of a
[2:06:12] sudden you're wiring everything up wrong
[2:06:15] and all of a sudden you turn the switch
[2:06:16] on and you're blowing circuits
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] that's why it's so very important the
[2:06:27] scripture says to be Faithfully taught
[2:06:31] amen than teach
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:37] others brother Brandon was not looking
[2:06:39] for larger
[2:06:41] crowds he was looking for men that would
[2:06:44] be Faithfully
[2:06:47] taught third poll is a separating poll
[2:06:53] too much of the time we lean back on
[2:06:55] first and second poll because you know
[2:06:57] what there's no offense to either one of
[2:06:58] those do you know that the only miracle
[2:07:01] that Jesus Christ did when he entered
[2:07:03] into the third pole of his own Ministry
[2:07:07] he reveals the word it becomes offense
[2:07:09] but the only physical thing that he does
[2:07:12] in a resurrected Ministry was open
[2:07:16] eyes the two on the road to emus
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:23] God is a separator not a mixer
[2:07:26] amen is that right God's a
[2:07:30] separator in the leading of the spirit
[2:07:33] brother Ram said you select the young
[2:07:34] fellow who's just out of school who's
[2:07:37] smart and witty a social mixer God don't
[2:07:40] want a mixer he wants a
[2:07:42] separator God wants something and you
[2:07:45] choose him because a lot of times he's
[2:07:47] very smooth he's kind like see God don't
[2:07:50] choose men like that you're a separated
[2:07:54] people by the Holy Ghost see the world
[2:07:57] wants today the world is wanting today
[2:08:00] is mixers they want somebody who will
[2:08:02] walk around and fellowship with the
[2:08:05] world and fellowship with the people and
[2:08:07] get a lot of members and have a social
[2:08:10] organization but when the Holy Ghost
[2:08:12] said separate me Paul God is a separator
[2:08:15] not a mixer
[2:08:18] amen Feast of trumpets 64 God is a
[2:08:21] separator not a
[2:08:23] mixer the church wants a good mixer
[2:08:26] today let them wear bathing suits
[2:08:30] shorts everything else and get out and

[2:08:57] work finishing the work is catching the
[2:08:59] Revelation and going on

[2:09:04] rough in St John 6 verse 28 they they
[2:09:08] said unto him what shall we do that we
[2:09:11] might work the works of God Jesus
