[14:06] God bless you.
[14:09] Let's all bow our heads
[14:13] and Lord. What a
[14:16] privilege, Lord, that you gave us ears
[14:18] to hear,
[14:20] eyes to
[14:22] see, hearts to
[14:24] receive. Lord, even as our brother
[14:27] preached last
[14:28] night, I couldn't help but think about
[14:31] [Music]
[14:33] Peter after he denied you, Lord.
[14:37] Yeah, I'm sure he thought, "Why? Why
[14:40] would he have chosen me? Why? Why would
[14:43] I be one of them? How could I be one of
[14:47] them?" And when you stood before him,
[14:49] your love,
[14:52] Lord, that brought his revelation next
[14:55] level. As our brother spoke, he went to
[14:58] the next level. His blood really is
[15:01] sufficient for my sin, my unbelief.
[15:06] Lord, you
[15:07] are you are sufficient. And Lord, today
[15:11] we ask that we could receive
[15:14] more. Lord, the world's getting
[15:17] dark. And you said we'd be the light of
[15:21] the
[15:22] world. Lord, may we catch that next
[15:25] level revelation. I pray, Lord, meet all
[15:29] the needs.
[15:32] Lord, you're the need
[15:33] supplier. Bless our brothers. as he
[15:35] would speak
[15:37] today. Ask Lord that our hearts Lord
[15:40] that we'd be fertile ground to bring
[15:42] forth that which you want to
[15:44] manifest. Lord, thank you for this
[15:47] assembly. Bless everyone that made the
[15:49] effort to be here today. Father, we're
[15:52] taking one step towards you. We ask you
[15:55] to reach your hand out
[15:57] in mercy and grace. We love you. We ask
[15:59] it all in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[16:04] God bless you. You may be
[16:08] seated. Amen. Sing. My sins are gone.
[16:11] You ask me why I'm happy. Oh, you ask me
[16:15] why I'm happy. So I'll just tell you
[16:18] why.
[16:20] Because my sins are
[16:23] gone. And when I meet golfers who ask me
[16:28] where they are, I
[16:30] say, "My sins are gone." And they're
[16:35] underneath the blood on the cross of
[16:38] Calvary. As far as this darkness is the
[16:43] dawn. Oh, in the sea of God's
[16:46] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[16:48] me. Praise
[16:50] God. My sins are
[16:53] gone. And was at the old time altar
[16:57] where God came in my heart. And
[17:00] now my sins are
[17:03] gone. And the Lord took all possession.
[17:07] The devil did depart. I'm
[17:10] glad my sins are gone. And they're
[17:14] underneath the blood. On the cross of
[17:18] Calvary has far removed the darkness
[17:21] from
[17:22] dawn. There is the sea of God's
[17:25] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[17:28] me. Praise
[17:29] God. My sins are
[17:32] gone. And when Satan comes to temp me,
[17:36] tries to make me doubt. I
[17:39] say my sins are
[17:41] gone. Oh, you got me into trouble. But
[17:46] Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are
[17:50] gone.
[17:52] And there are blood on the cross of
[17:56] Calvary as far removed as darkness is
[18:01] gone in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[18:05] That's good enough for me. Praise
[18:08] God. My sins are gone and I'm living now
[18:13] for Jesus. Happy night and day
[18:17] because my sins are gone.
[18:21] Oh my soul is filled with music. All my

[18:31] underneath the blood on the cross of
[18:35] Calvary. Far remove this darkness
[18:39] on the sea of God forgetfulness. That's
[18:43] good enough for me. Praise

[18:50] underneath the blood on the cross of
[18:54] Calvary. Far removed and darkness is
[18:58] gone. In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[19:02] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[19:06] My sins are gone. And God is
[19:10] good all the
[19:12] time. He put a song of praise in this
[19:16] heart of mine. God is good

[19:26] will shine. God is
[19:29] good. God is
[19:31] good all the
[19:33] time. When you're
[19:36] walking through the
[19:38] valley and there are shadows all
[19:42] around, oh, do not fear.
[19:46] My God will guide you. He will keep you

[20:27] time. Oh, we were
[20:29] sinners so
[20:32] unworthy. Yet for us, he chose to
[20:36] die and filled us with his holy spirit.

[37:11] trying to greet everyone because then
[37:13] you might miss someone. and somebody
[37:15] feels bad and I don't want to do that.
[37:17] So anyway, the Lord bless you all. I
[37:20] appreciate it. Let's all stand. I'd like
[37:22] to sing that song, Take Me Deeper. Amen.
[37:24] I believe that God wants to take every
[37:26] one of you deeper. He wants to take you
[37:29] to a higher level. He wants you to take
[37:32] you to another dimension.
[37:37] Amen.
[37:38] If there is a
[37:41] longing only you can
[37:44] [Music]
[37:46] fill a raging
[37:50] tempest only you can
[37:55] still my soul is thirsty Lord to know
[38:00] you as I'm
[38:03] known and drink from the
[38:07] river that flows before your
[38:11] [Music]
[38:12] throne. So take me
[38:17] deeper, deeper in
[38:20] love with
[38:22] you, Jesus, hold me close in your
[38:28] embrace.
[38:30] Oh, take me
[38:34] deeper, deeper than I've ever been
[38:37] before. Oh, I just want to love you more
[38:42] and
[38:43] more. How I
[38:45] long to be deeper in love.
[38:54] Sunrise,
[38:56] sunrise, I will seek your
[39:00] face. Drawn by the
[39:03] spirit to the promise of your
[39:09] grace. My heart is found in you. A hope
[39:14] that will
[39:16] abide. Amen.
[39:19] Your
[39:20] presence forever
[39:25] satisfied. Just take me
[39:27] [Music]
[39:30] deeper, deeper in
[39:35] love, Jesus. Hold me close in your
[39:39] embrace.
[39:40] [Music]
[39:42] Oh, take me
[39:46] deeper, deeper than I've ever been
[39:49] before. And I just want to love you more
[39:53] and
[39:54] more. How I long to be
[39:59] deeper in
[40:03] love. Amen. Is that what your longing
[40:06] is? To be deeper. Amen. That's my
[40:09] longing to this morning. Amen. I've
[40:11] never come to the place where I've had
[40:13] enough.
[40:14] Amen. I don't ever want to come to the
[40:16] place where I've had enough. I want
[40:18] more. Amen. I believe there's more for
[40:21] us. God bless you all this morning. It's
[40:24] certainly wonderful to be here with you.
[40:26] Amen. Like brother Ron said, it's our
[40:28] first time here, but oh, we felt so at
[40:31] home last night. Amen. The atmosphere
[40:33] was so good and we enjoyed the word and
[40:36] we appreciate always our brother Jason.
[40:37] and he's been a real inspiration for me
[40:40] over the years and a real help to me in
[40:42] uh my early years. And just want to say
[40:45] uh God bless you and I want to bring
[40:47] greetings from our home church,
[40:49] Believers Christian Fellowship in Lima,
[40:50] Ohio. Amen. They're all praying for the
[40:53] services here and we've got quite a
[40:55] connection back and forth now because
[40:57] you know we've got uh a couple of the
[40:59] loud boys there and their wives and so
[41:01] we've had some the Braders come and
[41:03] visit and the LAS come and visit. So,
[41:05] we've got connected and Sister Mard's
[41:07] got family in the area. Her brother
[41:09] attends the church, so we get to see
[41:10] her. And some of our saints come down
[41:12] here now and and so there's quite a
[41:15] traffic back and forth. So, I felt it
[41:18] was uh really wonderful to be able to
[41:19] come. And we got Matthew Eron. God bless
[41:21] you, Matthew. He moved down here a few
[41:22] years ago. He grew up there in Lima,
[41:25] Ohio. And now he gets to enjoy
[41:28] sunshine. Amen. So, we can see why he
[41:30] likes it here. It's beautiful. Amen. and
[41:33] also brother Sal and sister Marge
[41:35] Marzulli. They're good friends of ours
[41:37] from back home in in Ohio. And also
[41:40] we've got brother Jonathan Bombgard and
[41:42] his uh as daughter here. He's a deacon
[41:45] in the church. So he traveled down. But
[41:48] oh, God bless you, brother David and
[41:50] Sister Diane and Ruth. Good friends of
[41:52] ours. It's good to have you. So we feel
[41:53] at home. Amen. Amen. So we appreciate
[41:56] being able to be here with you. Amen.
[41:59] While we're standing, if you'll just
[42:00] take your Bibles and we'll go right to
[42:02] the
[42:03] word. I'm not very good at the
[42:05] preliminary
[42:06] things. Amen. But praise God. Uh I just
[42:11] want you to know we love you and we
[42:13] appreciate you. And everybody who's come
[42:14] to visit us, we really enjoy their
[42:16] fellowship. And so they've been good
[42:18] representations of the church. Amen.
[42:20] They they've uh they've been a blessing
[42:22] for us. If we could turn to the book of
[42:25] Acts, chapter 7.
[42:35] Acts chapter 7. We'll begin there and
[42:39] we'll start with verse
[42:42] 44. Acts chapter 7 verse
[42:45] 44. Our fathers had a tabernacle of
[42:49] witness in the wilderness, as he had as
[42:51] he had appointed, speaking unto Moses,
[42:54] that he should make it, according to the
[42:56] fashion that he had seen, which also our
[42:58] fathers that came after brought in with
[43:00] Jesus unto the possession of the
[43:02] Gentiles, whom God drove out before the
[43:04] face of our fathers unto the days of
[43:07] David, who found favor before God, and
[43:09] desired to find a tabernacle for the God
[43:11] of Jacob. But Solomon built him a house.
[43:15] How be it, the most high dwelleth not in
[43:18] temples made with hands, as sayeth the
[43:19] prophet. Heaven is my earth, heaven is
[43:22] my throne, and earth is my foottool.
[43:25] What house will you build me, sayaeth
[43:27] the Lord, or what is the place of my
[43:30] rest? Let's turn to Hebrews chapter
[43:35] 10. We'll pick up one verse before we
[43:37] pray and have you be seated. Hebrews
[43:40] chapter
[43:42] 10 and verse 5. of Hebrews chapter 10
[43:46] and verse 5.
[43:53] He says in verse 5, "Wherefore when he
[43:55] cometh into the world, he saith,
[43:57] sacrifice and offering thou wouldest
[43:59] not, but a body hast thou prepared me."
[44:04] Let's bow our heads
[44:05] together. Dear heavenly father, we're so
[44:08] thankful God that you saw fit to gather
[44:11] us together.
[44:12] We know, Lord, that we're not here of
[44:14] our own accord. For Lord, no man can
[44:16] come unless you draw us. And Lord,
[44:19] you've ordained this morning. You've
[44:21] ordained and orchestrated it all. And
[44:23] we're here at your bidding, Lord. And
[44:25] God, our desire is that you would find
[44:27] welcome here, Lord. God, your prophet
[44:30] told us that you keep all of your
[44:32] appointments. So, we know that you've
[44:33] come according to your word. For you
[44:35] said, wherever two or three are gathered
[44:36] in your name, you'll be in their midst.
[44:39] My God, may it not be like Simon's house
[44:42] where you weren't welcome. But may this
[44:43] be a reception, Lord, where we kiss you,
[44:45] Lord, where we anoint you, where we wash
[44:48] your feet with our tears, where you are
[44:50] found welcome and you're placed at the
[44:52] head of the table, where you can come
[44:54] and take the preeminent position among
[44:56] us, Lord. And we're asking you to come
[44:58] now and by your own hands break the
[45:00] bread of life for us, Lord. And may our
[45:02] eyes be open and may we see you, Lord,
[45:05] as we've seen you before. May you reveal
[45:07] yourself to us, God. I pray you would
[45:10] take this vessel of mine under your
[45:11] control. For Father, you know my needs,
[45:14] Lord. I need you, Lord, to come on the
[45:16] scene. But God, as I yield myself to
[45:18] you, we also have faith in your way. For
[45:20] you chose the foolishness of preaching.
[45:23] And so we come in respect to that, Lord,
[45:26] honoring that command. I pray that you
[45:28] bless your people. And may all that we
[45:30] say and do be pleasing unto you. In
[45:32] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[45:36] Man, you can have your seats. Thank you
[45:37] very
[45:39] much. Amen. So, we read these two
[45:42] scriptures and they don't seemingly go
[45:45] together, but brother Brenham took these
[45:47] two scriptures and placed them together,
[45:49] which is amazing. I always marvel at the
[45:51] scriptures brother Ben Brandham puts
[45:53] together because a prophet is a divine
[45:55] interpreter of the word and he'll make
[45:57] combinations that I would have never
[45:59] made on my own. He'll say something from
[46:01] here and something from here and he'll
[46:02] connect it together and show us that it
[46:04] goes together. Amen. And so we're going
[46:06] to we're going to look at this. Uh I'd
[46:08] like to take for a title, A Body Hast
[46:10] Thou Prepared Me. Amen. Amen. I'm doing
[46:13] something new, something I've never done
[46:15] before. I I sent my uh uh word document
[46:19] off to the Tech brothers and they've got
[46:21] it up here on the overhead. So, I don't
[46:23] know that I'll go in order. I don't know
[46:24] that I'll I'll I'll read everything
[46:26] that's on my notes, but we'll just work
[46:27] together and see where we get. Amen. For
[46:30] God is good. Amen. I tell every visiting
[46:32] minister that we have that comes to the
[46:34] church and when I'm in the back I tell
[46:36] them the same thing. I said, "You just
[46:38] preach what you love because what you
[46:40] love is what we'll love." So that's all
[46:42] I'm here today to do is just tell you
[46:44] things that I love. Amen. Things that
[46:46] excite me, things that thrill my soul,
[46:48] things that give me life and energy. And
[46:51] and I believe it'll do the same for you.
[46:54] Brother Brandham uh in the message
[46:57] stature of a perfect man. Brother
[46:59] Brandham is the one who takes these two
[47:01] scriptures and puts them together in
[47:03] this m message stature of a perfect man.
[47:06] He says now uh the tabernacle is of
[47:09] course a place where we go to rest. Now
[47:11] get freshness and so forth like resting
[47:13] from sleep or so forth. Hebrews 10 and
[47:16] the fifth verse Paul brings it in.
[47:18] Wherefore we when he cometh to the
[47:20] world, he saith, "Sacrifice." That's
[47:21] Christ. Sacrifice and offering thou
[47:23] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[47:25] prepared me. What is the tabernacle now?
[47:28] A body. God tabernacled in a body. Amen.
[47:32] So when we were in Acts 7, he says, "But
[47:34] the Most High dwelleth not in a house
[47:36] made with hands." Amen. But what house
[47:38] will you build for me? And the house
[47:40] that he wanted to be dwelling in, that
[47:43] he wanted to be tabernacled in was a
[47:45] body. Amen. That's what he always
[47:47] desired. Again, in stature of a perfect
[47:50] man, brother Bam says, "Now God or the
[47:52] Bible said here that Steven spoke of
[47:54] Solomon building a temple and the most
[47:56] high don't dwell in temples made with
[47:59] hands. For heaven is my throne and earth
[48:01] is my foottool and where is the place of
[48:03] my rest? But a body hast thou prepared
[48:06] me?" See how brother Bam just took these
[48:08] two scriptures and he stuck them
[48:09] together like it was one scripture
[48:11] because to him they go together. Amen.
[48:13] Amen. But a body hast thou prepared me?
[48:16] Amen. There you are. A body hast thou
[48:18] prepared me? God dwells in the stature
[48:20] of a man, reflecting himself into that
[48:23] being. Perfect worship.
[48:28] Amen. Where is the provided place of
[48:30] worship? It's the place where he placed
[48:31] his name, which is in Christ. And when
[48:34] you get in Christ, where is Christ? In
[48:36] you. Perfect worship. Amen.
[48:40] Yes, sir. Listen now. perfect worship
[48:42] God in us
[48:45] being his tabernacle God manifesting. So
[48:48] when brother Brennan begins this message
[48:49] statue of a perfect man he shows that
[48:51] that tabernacle was a body which was the
[48:53] Lord Jesus Christ when God would come
[48:55] and tabernacle himself in full measure
[48:58] and a man in flesh and that flesh man
[49:00] would be a reflection of the invisible
[49:02] God. Amen. So that you could touch and
[49:04] see and understand God when you see this
[49:07] man. Amen. But brother Benham doesn't
[49:09] leave it there. Amen. What house will
[49:11] you build me? What is the tabernacle?
[49:13] Brother Brenham brings it right down to
[49:15] you and I.
[49:17] Amen. So, it goes further. It keeps
[49:20] working its way down. Amen. To God's uh
[49:23] uh idea, what God wanted to do. If we go
[49:26] to the message, Christ is the mystery of
[49:28] God revealed. He says this, but what he
[49:31] wanted to do, he loved fatherhood for he
[49:34] was a father and the only way that he
[49:36] could express it was to become a son of
[49:38] man. That's the reason Jesus kept saying
[49:41] the son of man. See, they didn't know
[49:43] what he was talking about, many of them.
[49:46] But now you get it. He wanted to
[49:49] express himself.
[49:53] So, let's just stop there for a minute
[49:54] and not not read on. What was God's When
[49:57] we come to Christ is the mystery of God
[49:59] revealed, Brother Benham is now
[50:00] explaining to us the great mystery
[50:02] secret that was in the back part of
[50:04] God's mind. one thing that he wanted to
[50:06] accomplish, one goal that he had in the
[50:08] entire Bible. So we know that God had
[50:11] one goal, one plan, one thing that he
[50:14] was trying to achieve. And all of the
[50:17] Bible is expressing this one goal that
[50:19] God had. And this is the mystery of God.
[50:22] This is Revelations 10:7. What God
[50:25] actually wanted to achieve and
[50:27] everything that he was doing and all
[50:29] that he made, he had a goal in mind, an
[50:31] achievement, an expression. And what he
[50:33] wanted to do was express himself.
[50:36] That was his great goal was to express
[50:38] himself. Amen. And so that was God's
[50:42] mystery plan. And then in Christ is the
[50:44] mystery of God revealed. He says, "Now
[50:45] it's unfolded in a three-fold manner."
[50:48] So there's three parts to this great
[50:50] plan of God, but it's one plan, one
[50:53] goal. And brother Benham said, "Amen."
[50:55] He ties it to the seventh seal, and he
[50:57] ties it to the coming of the Lord. And
[50:59] then he shows that it's been in every
[51:01] type and every shadow and all the
[51:02] characters of the Bible have been
[51:04] expressing this great mystery of God.
[51:07] Oh, praise be to God. Amen. You know
[51:10] what I love? I love your love for the
[51:13] word. Because I'm just talking about
[51:14] what I love. And I can see that you love
[51:16] it. And so we love the same one. Amen.
[51:19] He's the He's the wonderful one to us,
[51:21] our bridegroom.
[51:24] So he wanted to express himself.
[51:27] That was his one of his great three-fold
[51:29] purposes was to express himself identify
[51:32] himself with human beings to reveal
[51:35] himself in Christ.
[51:38] Secondly, to have the preeminence on a
[51:40] body of believers that is his bride that
[51:43] he might live in people.
[51:47] Now listen to what he says. Now he could
[51:49] do that in Adam and Eve but sin
[51:52] separated them. So there now had to be
[51:54] some way to get it back again.
[51:57] Look at that. So God could do this in
[52:01] the beginning with Adam and Eve. And
[52:03] what what he wanted to do is he wanted
[52:05] to show forth this plan. Yes.
[52:08] If we go back to the Garden of Eden,
[52:12] uh God when he begins to express what he
[52:16] wants to express coming into Genesis
[52:18] 1:2, he's now expressing he he's going
[52:22] to begin expressing this great mystery
[52:23] thought that he has this great desire.
[52:25] And what he's going to do first, Brother
[52:27] Bam said, he creates a masterpiece.
[52:30] So he creates a masterpiece. And the
[52:32] masterpiece now he places in a beautiful
[52:35] setting in Eden and he finishes his
[52:38] masterpiece and it's a masterpiece
[52:40] family. And when he finishes the
[52:42] masterpiece family, he goes to take his
[52:44] rest. Amen. We know God's got a plan on
[52:47] all of these things. But what he does
[52:48] first is he shows us what the
[52:50] masterpiece is
[52:52] so that we understand what the great
[52:55] artist is working on. What? Because an
[52:57] artist has a has a inspiration, has a
[53:00] vision in his mind of what he wants to
[53:02] do. And then he works and he works and
[53:04] he works his art until the vision in his
[53:06] mind is now manifest. And whatever
[53:09] manifold, whether it be in clay or in
[53:11] marble or or in paint, he manifests
[53:14] what's in his mind. Amen. And the artist
[53:16] doesn't stop. He doesn't stop until he's
[53:20] finished the perfect image of his mind.
[53:23] So he keeps working and he keeps
[53:24] working. He keeps working. Remember this
[53:26] is a masterpiece family. And so now the
[53:28] first part of this masterpiece is he
[53:30] creates a man in his own image.
[53:33] And he brings forth Adam and now and he
[53:36] brings him down and he places him in
[53:37] flesh and he sets him as God of the
[53:39] earth. Amen. And he's there and God now
[53:42] looks at Adam. Amen. And he says, "Uh,
[53:45] it is not good.
[53:49] Oh my goodness. I go back to this all
[53:51] the time. I preached on this I don't
[53:52] know how many times, but you can never
[53:54] get away from it." Amen. Brother said
[53:56] Genesis is the seed chapter, seed book
[53:58] of the whole Bible. Everything begins
[54:00] there, ends in Revelations. And you can
[54:02] see it, brothers and sisters. It starts
[54:04] here and ends in Revelation. But now we
[54:08] can see that God now he everything every
[54:11] day he's creating. He's creating and he
[54:13] says, "It's good. It's good. It's good.
[54:17] It's good." And he gets man and man's
[54:19] now on earth. He's he's now physical.
[54:21] He's tangible. everything he's lured
[54:24] over now can see him and and he's
[54:26] expressed like they are in animal form
[54:28] and and he's physically on the earth.
[54:30] And then God says something for the
[54:32] first time in Genesis. He said, "It's
[54:33] not good.
[54:36] It's not good that man should be alone."
[54:37] And then he says, "Why is it not good?
[54:40] You're the one who made it that way.
[54:43] How could you say it's not good? You're
[54:45] the only one who's been constructing
[54:47] this so far." Amen. Listen, every word
[54:49] in the Bible is written for us. Amen. to
[54:52] catch something. Why did God say it was
[54:54] not good? Because he wants you to know
[54:56] what's not good. It's not good that man
[54:58] shall dwell alone. I shall make a help
[54:59] meat for him. And brother Brandham said,
[55:01] Adam was lonely because God was lonely
[55:04] because God wanted
[55:06] fellowship. He wanted to express himself
[55:08] and he wanted to have fellowship. So now
[55:11] he's expressing that in this dimension
[55:13] through a son made in his image. And
[55:15] that son's alone. But now he's going to
[55:17] make a help meat for him. Amen. So what
[55:19] does he do? He brings forth every every
[55:22] creature out of the dust of the ground
[55:23] and brings them to Adam to see what he
[55:25] would name to see if there was a
[55:26] suitable help meat for him.
[55:29] And nothing would suit. So all of
[55:32] creation, everything that was being
[55:33] created, nothing suitable. Nothing
[55:35] suitable. Nothing suitable. And what's
[55:37] God doing? God's expressing, Amen.
[55:39] heaven is now being expressed on earth
[55:41] because he had created the heavenly
[55:43] realms. Cherubam, saraphim, the whole
[55:45] mighty host that was in heaven. And
[55:47] there was nothing for God to fellowship
[55:49] with in heaven.
[55:53] He had worship. He had praise. The
[55:55] angels worshiped him day and night.
[55:57] Listen, God has built you and I in
[55:59] places here for more than worship and
[56:01] praise. We do worship and praise him,
[56:03] but he already had that in the heavenly
[56:05] realm. But he wanted something more than
[56:08] just worship and praise. He wanted
[56:11] fellowship. And so now he's expressing
[56:14] this in creation. And now Adam is Lord
[56:17] of all, God of all the earth, in
[56:20] complete control. And everything that's
[56:22] made of all the things that are made,
[56:23] they're all good, but none of it has
[56:25] fellowship. And there's only one way for
[56:28] Adam to have fellowship. God's going to
[56:30] take a part of Adam
[56:32] and pull out a part of Adam to express
[56:35] another expression of Adam. And when he
[56:38] brings another expression of Adam, now
[56:41] Adam will find something he can
[56:43] fellowship with because he can only
[56:45] fellowship with himself.
[56:47] [Applause]
[56:56] That's why brother Brandham says, "I see
[56:58] the seventh seal coming all the way up
[57:00] from the beginning in Genesis and all
[57:02] the way through
[57:05] in Satan's Eden." And brother Ram says,
[57:07] "And so God knew that we would be here.
[57:10] But then he put us in flesh so that we
[57:12] could be contacted in order he could
[57:14] contact. He became one of us when he
[57:16] became Jesus Christ, the son of God
[57:18] himself, the fullness of the
[57:19] manifestation of God. Therefore, that
[57:22] was God's purpose to display his
[57:24] attributes in fellowship." Amen. When I
[57:27] was in my father, I knew nothing about
[57:29] it. But when I become a son, I was born
[57:31] of him. I was an attribute part of my
[57:33] father. And you're a part of your
[57:34] father. And as children of God, we are
[57:37] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[57:39] made flesh like he was made flesh, so we
[57:42] can have fellowship one with the other
[57:45] as a family of God upon the earth. And
[57:49] that was God's purpose at the beginning.
[57:52] Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the
[57:55] beginning. Praise God. So what did God
[57:57] want at the beginning? God wanted his
[58:00] attributes of himself
[58:03] to come into manifestation
[58:06] to have fellowship one with another as a
[58:09] family of God upon the earth. That's
[58:12] what this original creation was all
[58:14] about. Amen. That's why fellowship is so
[58:17] important. That's why this meeting is so
[58:18] wonderful. That's why coming to see you
[58:20] is so fantastic. Amen. Because when we
[58:23] when listen when we come and have
[58:24] fellowship on the word of God and on the
[58:27] things of God and we're coming here
[58:28] around the message of the hour. Hey,
[58:30] listen. This isn't flesh with flesh.
[58:32] This is attribute connecting to
[58:34] attribute. This is God fellowshipping
[58:36] with God. This is the family of God.
[58:39] This is the fellowship he's longed for.
[58:43] Praise the Lord. That's why when you
[58:45] embrace your brother, you embrace your
[58:47] sister, who are you embracing?
[58:53] Amen.
[58:55] Amen. Amen. In the message
[58:57] identification, he said, "Then you see
[58:59] God came down and the character of God
[59:01] was Christ. He was the reflection. He
[59:03] was God made visible." Notice God made
[59:06] visible. In the beginning was God. He
[59:08] wasn't even God then. No, God is an
[59:10] object of worship. Only thing he was was
[59:12] the eternal. And in him was attributes.
[59:14] And those attributes were thoughts. And
[59:16] those thoughts was expressed to words.
[59:18] and word was made manifest. Amen. What
[59:21] is it? It's all God becoming tangible
[59:24] and you are part of God.
[59:29] Praise praise be to God. Sometimes you
[59:32] read things and it just takes your
[59:33] breath away. And you say, "Can it be
[59:36] real?"
[59:38] Your mind will go squirly trying to
[59:41] piece it together and analyze it and
[59:43] make sense of it and you just get
[59:44] confused. But something inside starts to
[59:46] go thump thump thump thump. It's nothing
[59:49] but the truth. Amen. I can't explain it.
[59:52] I can't rationalize it. I can't read it
[59:54] reason it. But when he says it's all God
[59:56] becoming tangible and you are part of
[59:58] God, something inside goes thump thump.
[1:00:02] Amen.
[1:00:05] Amen. In the message, God is his own
[1:00:07] interpreter. He says, "And now remember,
[1:00:10] you Christians were his thoughts before
[1:00:11] there was a world and you are the
[1:00:14] manifestation of his thinking. Before
[1:00:16] before there uh even was a world, you
[1:00:19] were in Christ." Amen. In God in the
[1:00:21] beginning that makes you then you see
[1:00:23] his subjects and the whole thing is God
[1:00:26] himself materializing himself tangible
[1:00:30] so he could be handled, seen and so
[1:00:33] forth. And that's what God is the whole
[1:00:36] thing.
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:41] God is so good, friends.
[1:00:45] Amen. So, we're just laying these things
[1:00:48] down as the
[1:00:50] background to go into some things that
[1:00:53] we we've been looking at. If we can go
[1:00:54] to Genesis chapter 1
[1:00:56] now. Go back to the beginning.
[1:01:02] Genesis chapter
[1:01:08] 1 and verse
[1:01:15] 26. And God said, "Let us make man in
[1:01:18] our image after our likeness, and let
[1:01:20] him have dominion over the fish of the
[1:01:22] sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
[1:01:23] over the cattle, and over all the earth,
[1:01:25] and over every creeping thing that
[1:01:27] creepeth upon the earth."
[1:01:29] Now, we turn to Genesis chapter 2, and
[1:01:31] we've already recited this to you. God
[1:01:34] saw that it was not good that man should
[1:01:36] be alone. He laid him to sleep. He
[1:01:38] pulled out of him a rib, and he formed
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:42] woman. And and he says uh
[1:01:48] uh let's go to verse 21. Chapter 2,
[1:01:51] verse 21. And the Lord God caused a deep
[1:01:53] sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept,
[1:01:55] and he took one of his ribs and closed
[1:01:56] up the flesh instead thereof. And the
[1:01:58] rib which the Lord had taken from man
[1:02:00] made he woman and brought her unto the
[1:02:02] man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of
[1:02:05] my bones, and flesh of my flesh." She
[1:02:09] shall be called woman, because she was
[1:02:11] taken out of man. Amen. Therefore shall
[1:02:13] a man leave his father and mother, and
[1:02:15] shall cleave unto his wife, and they
[1:02:16] shall be one flesh. Amen. Oh, this is
[1:02:21] good. Praise him in the message. The God
[1:02:23] of his evil evil age, he says in God's
[1:02:26] own thinking, God the great spirit in
[1:02:28] the beginning. Before there was a
[1:02:30] beginning, he was God. And did you know
[1:02:31] you were in him then? If you are a
[1:02:34] Christian now, you was in him then. And
[1:02:36] then if that be so, the whole Godhead
[1:02:38] bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus
[1:02:40] Christ. And then when Jesus died at the
[1:02:44] cross, I died with him for I was in him
[1:02:47] then. For he was the fullness of the
[1:02:49] word manifested knowing that we would be
[1:02:52] manifest later and we was at Calvary
[1:02:54] with him.
[1:02:56] Amen. Why? Because an attribute of God
[1:02:58] is the word of God. And the full
[1:03:00] attributes of God, the full word of God
[1:03:02] was made flesh and dwelt among us. Amen.
[1:03:04] If that was the full word of God and I'm
[1:03:06] part of the world word of God, then I
[1:03:07] had to be part of that expression. I was
[1:03:10] there. Amen. I'm not conscious of it,
[1:03:12] not aware of it, don't understand
[1:03:13] anything about it. I don't even know in
[1:03:15] what form and I can't give you any
[1:03:17] explanation mechanically to make it make
[1:03:19] sense to your mind. The only thing I
[1:03:21] know is if that was the fullness of the
[1:03:23] word and I'm part of the word then I was
[1:03:25] there.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:29] That's why brother Brandham could say,
[1:03:31] "Amen. I was there." Amen. When they
[1:03:33] crossed the Red Sea, I mean, I was
[1:03:34] there. Why? Because it was the word
[1:03:36] being expressed. And wherever the word's
[1:03:38] been expressed, I'm there. I'm connected
[1:03:39] to it. I'm part of it because I was part
[1:03:41] of that great one mystery thought that
[1:03:43] was in God's mind. Amen. And the
[1:03:45] thoughts of God are eternal. Brother Bam
[1:03:47] said, "The thoughts of God are eternal.
[1:03:49] They're real. They're not like our
[1:03:50] thoughts. They're not like a blueprint.
[1:03:52] They're already real. They're not
[1:03:54] becoming real. They're real."
[1:04:00] Amen.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah. And what what thoughts of
[1:04:06] God are eternal?
[1:04:10] Because obviously God thought of his
[1:04:12] plan of redemption because he had the
[1:04:13] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:04:15] world. So if he knew that he would come
[1:04:17] as a lamb and he would knew he'd be
[1:04:18] slain, he knew there would be a fall, he
[1:04:20] knew there would be those who would slay
[1:04:23] the lamb, he knew there would be a Roman
[1:04:24] government, he knew there would be uh
[1:04:26] Pharisees and sad, he knew all of that.
[1:04:29] He foresaw it all in the plan of
[1:04:31] redemption. And so because uh because
[1:04:35] Pharaoh and because Caesar and because
[1:04:38] Pilate and because Ananas sacrifice were
[1:04:40] in his thinking, does that make them
[1:04:42] eternal?
[1:04:46] Amen. No. Because brother Bam tells us
[1:04:48] it was the thoughts of himself.
[1:04:52] The thoughts that he had of himself. And
[1:04:55] when he was thinking of himself, that's
[1:04:57] the one great mystery that he had in the
[1:05:00] back part of his mind. the thought of
[1:05:02] himself, how he would come into
[1:05:04] expression, how he would manifest his
[1:05:06] attributes, how he would express
[1:05:07] himself. Amen. How he would make himself
[1:05:10] his attributes on the earth and how he
[1:05:11] would collect them back together in
[1:05:13] redemption. Amen. Those are the eternal
[1:05:15] thoughts of God.
[1:05:18] It's gone. That's right.
[1:05:21] Materializing, becoming tangible. Yes.
[1:05:25] So he says when he was at Calvary
[1:05:28] because first he says when God had this
[1:05:32] plan mystery plan in his mind the
[1:05:34] thoughts of God I was there. Amen.
[1:05:36] Because I'm an attribute of his
[1:05:38] thinking. Amen. And then when those
[1:05:41] those thoughts come into expression and
[1:05:43] were made flesh in the body of Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ, I was there too.
[1:05:48] Amen. That's right.
[1:05:51] Amen. Because we're part of it.
[1:05:55] So when
[1:05:56] God made
[1:05:58] Adam and Adam was expressed on the earth
[1:06:02] and God was and Adam was walking around
[1:06:05] and it wasn't good that he was alone
[1:06:07] because he was lonely. Amen. There was
[1:06:11] somebody else with him.
[1:06:14] Amen. Amen. When God told him to take
[1:06:17] dominion, there was somebody else with
[1:06:19] him. Yeah. When God told him to multiply
[1:06:21] and replenish, there was somebody else
[1:06:23] with him.
[1:06:25] Amen. Cuz his bride was already in him.
[1:06:29] She was there. And God said, Amen. He
[1:06:31] made them male and female. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:34] And so he he made him in the image of
[1:06:36] God. Made him male. Male and female made
[1:06:38] he them. And then he placed them in
[1:06:40] Adam. So in Adam was the expression of
[1:06:42] male and female all wrapped up in one.
[1:06:44] He was the fullness of that expression.
[1:06:46] Amen. And so when God, amen, wanted to
[1:06:49] go ahead and find fellowship for Adam,
[1:06:51] he didn't find another created being,
[1:06:53] another creation, what he did is he took
[1:06:56] what was inside of Adam. Brother
[1:06:58] Brandham said he split the feminist
[1:07:00] spirit off of Adam and he separated the
[1:07:03] masculine and feminist and put the
[1:07:04] feminist in another body and took part
[1:07:07] of his flesh to make that body. And
[1:07:09] Adam, when he saw this woman, he said,
[1:07:11] "This is it." Amen. This is the one. You
[1:07:14] brought every creature before me,
[1:07:15] everything that was made, 4-footed
[1:07:17] beast, and every kind of creepy thing,
[1:07:19] and nothing was there. But this is it.
[1:07:21] This is what I can fellowship because
[1:07:23] this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my
[1:07:27] bone. She is me.
[1:07:31] When you look at, she is me. That's me
[1:07:34] looking back at me.
[1:07:40] Amen. and not listen it wasn't a carbon
[1:07:44] copy
[1:07:46] it was a complimentary piece
[1:07:49] because this was male and now this was
[1:07:51] female and now when and brother Brandham
[1:07:53] said and and and then he put them two
[1:07:55] back together he says and the first
[1:07:58] marriage that ever took place the first
[1:08:00] marriage ceremony he put them back
[1:08:01] together as one and now they are one
[1:08:04] flesh what are they what makes them one
[1:08:07] two complimentary pieces amen what they
[1:08:09] came from the same source one was
[1:08:11] separated out, united back together, and
[1:08:14] they were one.
[1:08:17] That's right.
[1:08:19] Oh, praise be to God.
[1:08:22] Let's go to uh uh uh uh uh Genesis
[1:08:25] chapter
[1:08:30] 5. Amen. I feel like laboring on this
[1:08:32] just for a minute.
[1:08:38] Praise God. Thank you, brother. Make me
[1:08:40] feel good.
[1:08:45] Not everybody agrees with you, but I do.
[1:08:48] We're in agreement.
[1:08:52] Amen.
[1:08:54] Genesis chapter
[1:08:55] 5. Let's look at verse one.
[1:08:59] This is the book of the generations of
[1:09:01] Adam in the day that God created man and
[1:09:03] the likeness of God made he him. male
[1:09:06] and female created he them and blessed
[1:09:09] them and called their name Adam
[1:09:12] in the day when they were created
[1:09:19] you
[1:09:21] realize Eve is not a good name
[1:09:25] I know there's so many times listen
[1:09:27] friends you just hang with me for a
[1:09:29] minute because I say some things
[1:09:30] sometime and I don't mean to do it this
[1:09:32] way but I say some things that are
[1:09:34] shocking sometimes but I don't mean to
[1:09:36] be shocking. I don't do it for shock. In
[1:09:37] fact, I do it to my own church at home
[1:09:39] all the time. I say something and they
[1:09:40] look at me and they're staring at me
[1:09:42] like a mule looking at a new gate like,
[1:09:44] "What is
[1:09:45] this?" Because there's some things that
[1:09:47] strike you in Revelation and it's so
[1:09:49] hard to express it with human language.
[1:09:51] But listen, Eve never got a name till
[1:09:54] after she separated from her husband and
[1:09:56] fell in adultery. In her name, mother of
[1:09:59] all living is a name of adultery.
[1:10:02] Because how did she become the mother of
[1:10:03] all living? through adultery.
[1:10:06] So that name is like brother Benham said
[1:10:09] it's a blasphemous name.
[1:10:14] What was her original name? What was her
[1:10:17] name in the day she was created and
[1:10:19] unified with her husband? Her name was
[1:10:21] Adam.
[1:10:23] He made them male and female and called
[1:10:25] their plural name Adam singular. They
[1:10:28] had one name because in the eyes of God
[1:10:30] they were one. They started as one. He
[1:10:34] separated two expressions, united them
[1:10:36] back together. And to God, you may look
[1:10:39] and may you may see two individuals
[1:10:40] walking around in the garden, but when
[1:10:42] God looked, he saw one. And that one was
[1:10:45] Adam. It was Adam male and it was Adam
[1:10:49] female.
[1:10:51] You can imagine God, amen, coming in the
[1:10:53] cool of the evening. And brother Ram
[1:10:55] used to dramatize it for us. And he
[1:10:56] would come down in the cool of the
[1:10:58] evening. Amen. And you could see if he
[1:11:00] wanted, Amen. If he wanted Adam, he
[1:11:02] wanted his son to come running to him,
[1:11:04] he would call Adam.
[1:11:06] He'd come running. Come on. Now, if he
[1:11:09] wanted the woman to come to him, what
[1:11:10] would he call?
[1:11:13] You guys passed the
[1:11:15] test 100%.
[1:11:22] That's why in this day at the breaking
[1:11:24] of the seals and the opening of the
[1:11:26] word, Amen. There's no more Baptist.
[1:11:28] There's no more Catholic. There's no
[1:11:30] more Protestant. There's no more
[1:11:31] Pentecostal. There's just Jesus Christ.
[1:11:34] Mrs. Jesus Christ. She's come back in
[1:11:37] unification with the word. And she got
[1:11:40] her original name back.
[1:11:43] His name is her name because she came
[1:11:45] from him. She's part of him. And under
[1:11:47] this ministry in the end times, she's
[1:11:49] being united back to him. And she got
[1:11:51] her name restored.
[1:11:54] Brother Brandham in the first seal, he
[1:11:56] said, "I'm going to call you bride."
[1:11:59] Bride's not a name. Bride's a title. I'm
[1:12:01] going to call you bride so that you'll
[1:12:04] understand. What is it you have to
[1:12:05] understand? You're going through an
[1:12:07] identity change now. Not denominational,
[1:12:10] not church, not systems, not seven
[1:12:12] church ages, but now you're coming to be
[1:12:14] the bride of Jesus Christ. And if you're
[1:12:17] the bride, then you take his name.
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:23] misses
[1:12:25] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:31] So, I'll make another shocking statement
[1:12:34] like Eve was a bad name. Now, don't feel
[1:12:36] bad for calling her Eve. That's the name
[1:12:37] her husband gave her. But it signifies
[1:12:40] her fall.
[1:12:43] That's why all these denominational
[1:12:45] names signify the fall.
[1:12:52] But now when you go to the garden before
[1:12:55] the fall, from the time the woman comes
[1:12:57] into expression before the fall, Adam
[1:13:02] lived in two bodies. Amen.
[1:13:08] Now listen, I told you a shocking
[1:13:11] statement. And listen, I promise I don't
[1:13:13] say it for shock factor. I just don't
[1:13:15] know how else to say it.
[1:13:18] Adam walked in two bodies.
[1:13:21] Yes, he did. Because the woman didn't
[1:13:24] have her own spirit.
[1:13:27] She had Adam's spirit. That's it.
[1:13:31] He God didn't create a new spirit. He
[1:13:34] took Adam's spirit and put Adam's spirit
[1:13:37] in her. And so, she was the feminine
[1:13:41] Adam spirit
[1:13:44] that was in Adam. When God separated
[1:13:46] out, he didn't just change its identity
[1:13:48] and now it's no longer. That was Adam's
[1:13:50] female spirit that he split off and put
[1:13:52] in another vessel and now this is Adam.
[1:13:57] I I Let's just slow down for a minute.
[1:14:01] Do you believe that both masculine and
[1:14:03] feminist were in one vessel named Adam?
[1:14:06] Okay. So, all of that was Adam. When God
[1:14:11] split the feminine spirit off and pulled
[1:14:13] that feminine spirit out and placed it
[1:14:15] in another vessel called women, what
[1:14:18] spirit was that? It was Adam's spirit.
[1:14:23] So, Adam now lived in two bodies.
[1:14:28] That's right.
[1:14:31] And God called them one. Amen. And they
[1:14:34] remained as one until she left her
[1:14:36] marriage vows. That's right. and went
[1:14:39] into adultery. Amen. Let's go to
[1:14:42] Ephesians chapter 5 together.
[1:14:54] Amen. I see brother Jason preach last
[1:14:56] night and I sit in my seat and I marvel.
[1:14:58] I love the way he preaches.
[1:15:01] I think I don't know if it's just me or
[1:15:03] other preachers feel the same way. When
[1:15:04] I see somebody else pre I'm like, I wish
[1:15:06] I preached like that. Amen. I give
[1:15:09] anything to be dynamic and powerful and
[1:15:13] tie those things together, but you know,
[1:15:15] we can only be what we are.
[1:15:18] And so, I appreciate y'all creating an
[1:15:20] atmosphere that lets me be what I am.
[1:15:23] Amen. Because I've never been successful
[1:15:25] at anything else. I'm a total failure
[1:15:27] being a copycat.
[1:15:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. And I've failed
[1:15:31] being myself a lot, too. So, if I can't
[1:15:34] get myself right, how am I going to be a
[1:15:36] copycat? Amen. Ephesians 5
[1:15:41] 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your
[1:15:44] own husbands as unto the Lord. For the
[1:15:45] husband is the head of the wife, even as
[1:15:47] Christ is the head of the church, and he
[1:15:49] is the savior of the body. Therefore, as
[1:15:51] the church is subject unto Christ, so
[1:15:52] let the wives be to their own husbands
[1:15:55] in everything. Husbands, love your wives
[1:15:57] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:15:59] gave himself for that he might sanctify
[1:16:01] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:16:03] by the word. that he might present it to
[1:16:06] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:16:08] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:16:10] he should be holy and without blemish.
[1:16:13] That's what he's done for us in this
[1:16:14] day. This is what invisible union's all
[1:16:17] about. Amen. Being washed in the
[1:16:19] bleeding word. Be restored back to a
[1:16:22] virgin condition to have all the
[1:16:23] prostitution swept away by the word of
[1:16:26] God in this day to bring us back to a
[1:16:28] virgin condition so we can unite with
[1:16:30] Christ. That's what he's doing. He's
[1:16:32] fulfilling Ephesians 5. Amen. So they
[1:16:36] could be holy and without blemish. So
[1:16:38] ought men to love their wives as their
[1:16:40] own bodies.
[1:16:42] Amen. Amen. He that loveth his wife
[1:16:45] loveth himself.
[1:16:47] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,
[1:16:50] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[1:16:52] the Lord the church. For we are members
[1:16:55] of his body, of his
[1:16:58] flesh, and of his bones.
[1:17:02] For this cause shall a man leave his
[1:17:04] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:17:05] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:17:07] flesh. This is a great mystery but I
[1:17:10] speak concerning Christ and the church.
[1:17:13] So he said what I'm talking to you looks
[1:17:14] like I'm talking about marriage and
[1:17:16] divor about marriage but he's not
[1:17:17] talking about marriage. He's talking
[1:17:18] about Christ in the church. It's a great
[1:17:20] mystery. It's a great time. And he says
[1:17:23] in verse 30 I'll read that again. For we
[1:17:25] are members of his body of his flesh and
[1:17:28] of his bones.
[1:17:30] Sometimes when I read that scripture, it
[1:17:32] just checks me on the inside. Is it
[1:17:35] really saying what it's saying?
[1:17:40] For we are members of his body, of his
[1:17:43] flesh, and of his bones.
[1:17:47] See, this isn't to me. This isn't
[1:17:49] figurative statement. This is very
[1:17:51] material.
[1:17:54] Flesh and
[1:17:56] bones. It's not like we're like Christ.
[1:18:01] It's not like we're like his body, but
[1:18:05] he the the Apostle Paul is telling us we
[1:18:08] are his body.
[1:18:10] It's not typology. It's reality.
[1:18:14] It's not figurative. It's not that kind
[1:18:17] of of language. He's not just speaking
[1:18:19] poetically, but Paul is actually
[1:18:21] breaking it down into a reality. And
[1:18:24] he's saying you are you are you are part
[1:18:26] of his body. You're members of his body
[1:18:28] of his flesh and of his bones.
[1:18:32] And he's saying, "No, no, no man ever
[1:18:34] yet hated his own flesh, but loveth it."
[1:18:36] Hey, husbands, love your wives as your
[1:18:38] own body. What's he showing you? A
[1:18:40] mystery. I'm really talking about Christ
[1:18:42] in his church. What is Christ loving?
[1:18:45] His own body. Amen. And no man ever yet
[1:18:48] hated his own body, but loveth and
[1:18:51] nourishes his own body, and washes it
[1:18:53] with the washing of the water of the
[1:18:55] word, so he can wash away all the pro
[1:18:57] filth of the prostitute spirits, so they
[1:18:59] can make can he present to himself.
[1:19:04] Hey, you realize that you've never done
[1:19:06] anything to make yourself presentable,
[1:19:08] but Christ presented to himself a church
[1:19:11] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:19:13] thing. Hey, hey, this message came with
[1:19:15] the purity of the word. You realize you
[1:19:17] can never be made spot-ree with a dirty
[1:19:20] word.
[1:19:21] With a polluted word, with a dirty
[1:19:24] water. You can't get clean with dirty
[1:19:26] water. Amen. And the word that had been
[1:19:28] corrupted through seven church ages
[1:19:30] could never make you spotless white
[1:19:32] virgin again. Amen. In order to bring
[1:19:34] back the purity and whiteness of the
[1:19:36] church, he had to bring back a washing
[1:19:38] material. And the washing material was
[1:19:40] his word. And that's why in the
[1:19:42] invisible union, you said you're washed
[1:19:44] by the bleeding bloody word. The word
[1:19:48] that bled for you. The word that died
[1:19:51] for you. What is washing you? It's the
[1:19:53] word that's washing you.
[1:19:57] What word? Not a dirty word. The pure
[1:19:59] word that's been restored through a
[1:20:01] prophetic ministry came. Why is he
[1:20:04] washing you? So that he can present to
[1:20:07] himself.
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:15] So many times we think, "I've got to do
[1:20:17] this and I've got to do that." And we so
[1:20:19] many times feel unworthy. Brother Jason
[1:20:22] was just hitting on that last night and
[1:20:23] it was blessing me because of things
[1:20:24] I've been through lately. Amen. We get
[1:20:27] discouraged and we don't feel like we
[1:20:28] measure up to the measuring stick.
[1:20:30] Listen, that's Satan.
[1:20:33] He's trying to bring us back into
[1:20:34] legalism. He's trying to bring us back
[1:20:36] into measuring sticks and works program
[1:20:39] and listen and we know we don't believe
[1:20:40] in all of that. None of us believe in
[1:20:42] that. But yet we go to it every time we
[1:20:45] get discouraged and we fail and we fall
[1:20:47] and we look in the mirror and we say,
[1:20:49] "Well, I'm not measuring up here. I'm
[1:20:50] not measuring up here." And we feel like
[1:20:53] we're unacceptable.
[1:20:58] Well, tell me what you can do to be
[1:21:00] acceptable because I want to do it.
[1:21:03] If you found something that you can do
[1:21:05] of your own effort to make you
[1:21:07] acceptable, please let me know.
[1:21:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. He's made us accepted
[1:21:14] in the beloved. Not that we've made
[1:21:16] ourselves. He's made us accepted and
[1:21:19] he's washed us. Why did he wash us? Why
[1:21:22] did he wash us in the water of the word
[1:21:24] and make us spotless and without
[1:21:26] blemish? So that he can unite again with
[1:21:29] his bride.
[1:21:31] Why? Because no man hateth his own
[1:21:34] flesh.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah. And we are his flesh
[1:21:41] and his bones according to Paul
[1:21:50] Brother said in Christ is the mystery
[1:21:51] God revealed. He said he is the head of
[1:21:53] the church which is his body and he
[1:21:55] wants the
[1:21:56] preeminences. Listen now listen close
[1:21:59] while we're going. One, he is to be the
[1:22:01] head of the body, his bride's body,
[1:22:03] which is taken from him, flesh and bone,
[1:22:09] like in Adam. See, bride. Amen. So,
[1:22:14] brother Ram's taking us right back to
[1:22:16] Adam and saying what he's doing is the
[1:22:19] same thing he did in Adam.
[1:22:22] Amen. Amen. What did he do in Adam? He
[1:22:25] took the feminist out of Adam and put it
[1:22:28] in another form. And that other form was
[1:22:32] Adam and he combined the two back
[1:22:34] together as one flesh.
[1:22:37] He's doing today the same thing he did
[1:22:39] in Adam.
[1:22:45] Brother Bam said sometimes you you
[1:22:47] really don't know what you are. That's
[1:22:49] right.
[1:22:50] And I say that's the truth, friends.
[1:22:53] These minds are corrupted and they're
[1:22:55] darkened and alienated from God. It's
[1:22:57] only this message that starts to break
[1:22:59] the light in and pierce through the
[1:23:01] darkness of our intellect and start
[1:23:03] striking our soul with a true
[1:23:05] identification
[1:23:15] my notes are all messed up. So, praise
[1:23:17] God. All right. When we saw that cloud
[1:23:20] come down in 1963,
[1:23:23] and brother Brenham comes later. Amen.
[1:23:25] And God tells him to turn it to the
[1:23:26] right. First, Brother Brenham saw it as
[1:23:28] a pyramid cloud, a constellation of
[1:23:30] angels. And he got caught up in it.
[1:23:32] Amen. But later when he saw to turn it
[1:23:34] to the right, he's thinking, well, I'm
[1:23:36] looking at it right now to the right. He
[1:23:37] turns it to the right. And there he sees
[1:23:40] the head of Christ.
[1:23:43] Amen. And where was the head coming to,
[1:23:46] friends?
[1:23:48] The head was coming to unite with the
[1:23:50] body. Where was the body? The body was
[1:23:54] on earth. Whose body?
[1:23:58] There's the question. Whose body? What
[1:24:00] body was that? You say, "Well, the body
[1:24:02] of his bride, the body of the church.
[1:24:04] He's the head of the church." All of
[1:24:06] that is true. But I ask you a question.
[1:24:09] If I duck myself down here and I stick
[1:24:12] my hand out,
[1:24:14] that's part of my body.
[1:24:17] I could bring three or four brothers
[1:24:18] back there. We could all duck ourselves
[1:24:20] down here and and then you could guess
[1:24:22] whose body that is. Amen. But there's
[1:24:24] one way to clearly identify what body it
[1:24:27] is. When you look at the head, the head
[1:24:30] identifies the body. So when the
[1:24:33] headship came to the body, it identified
[1:24:35] that the head is coming to the body of
[1:24:38] Christ which is a many membered body
[1:24:41] which is his bride. Our
[1:24:44] identification is not separate than the
[1:24:48] headship. But our identification is
[1:24:50] found in the headship so that I know who
[1:24:52] I am
[1:24:54] because of where I came from.
[1:24:58] Thank you Lord. We as the body, we only
[1:25:00] need to look to the head to find out who
[1:25:03] we are.
[1:25:07] And the message oneness brother says if
[1:25:09] you'll notice how that Eve was united
[1:25:11] with Adam she became part of him. Oh God
[1:25:14] did you notice in Genesis 1:27 he
[1:25:16] created man male and female. He created
[1:25:19] the he them. Now man was both male and
[1:25:23] female when it came to being in spirit
[1:25:25] of feminine and masculine. Then God took
[1:25:27] from his side a rib. Did you notice the
[1:25:29] body part was a byproduct but not the
[1:25:31] spirit? The body part of the woman was a
[1:25:33] byproduct after the creation had been
[1:25:35] finished. God took from the side of Adam
[1:25:37] a rib and made a woman, but not the
[1:25:39] spirit. The spirit was part of Adam, for
[1:25:42] he was both male and women. Woman,
[1:25:45] spiritually speaking, both masculine and
[1:25:46] feminist. Now, don't you see the great
[1:25:49] picture?
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:51] Oh, brothers, at this point of the
[1:25:53] stage, we read that statement a little
[1:25:54] differently than we did a little before.
[1:25:57] Don't you see the great picture? We and
[1:25:59] flesh are different. We're like a
[1:26:01] byproduct, a created being by holy
[1:26:03] wedlock. But in spirit we are sons and
[1:26:06] daughters. Not some other spirit but the
[1:26:08] spirit of the living God. We are in his
[1:26:11] likeness in his unity in the perfect
[1:26:13] image of the living God. Because we
[1:26:15] become sons and daughters. Not separated
[1:26:18] but the same spirit. The same God, the
[1:26:20] same person joined in wedlock to the
[1:26:23] eternal. See how God planned it that we
[1:26:25] should be not a different but him.
[1:26:28] Not some other being of some other tribe
[1:26:31] but a real union and offspring of
[1:26:33] almighty done by a holy union. Now the
[1:26:36] body comes from mother and father but
[1:26:38] the spirit comes from God. God separated
[1:26:41] himself as Adam was separated.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] Praise the Lord. On the day of Pentecost
[1:26:49] we find the Holy Spirit, the pillar of
[1:26:50] fire separating itself and settling upon
[1:26:53] each member of the church. God putting
[1:26:56] himself together.
[1:26:59] Then with that group of people together,
[1:27:01] what does it do? Brings back the unified
[1:27:04] body of the Lord Jesus coming together.
[1:27:08] Oh, praise be to God.
[1:27:11] I just want to go through a few
[1:27:13] scriptures quickly. I think they'll be
[1:27:14] on the overhead. We don't have to turn.
[1:27:15] I just want to hit them fast to show you
[1:27:17] how Paul taught this in the New
[1:27:19] Testament. In 1 Corinthians 12:27, he
[1:27:21] says, "Now you are the body of Christ."
[1:27:24] Amen. That's it. Not you will be. He's
[1:27:27] not talking about the future. He says
[1:27:30] now you are the body of Christ and
[1:27:32] members in particular. Meaning I may be
[1:27:36] just the speck off the tip of a little
[1:27:38] piece of skin.
[1:27:42] Praise the Lord. I might be a skin cell
[1:27:44] on the bottom of a foot of his foot.
[1:27:53] What is this? That's the tip of my
[1:27:55] pinky.
[1:27:59] That is Chad,
[1:28:07] that's not all of Chad,
[1:28:09] but this is certainly Chad. Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] If I touch my big toe, what what am I
[1:28:15] touching?
[1:28:18] You can call it has a title
[1:28:21] toe.
[1:28:23] But what's the name of my toe? Chad.
[1:28:30] Sometimes when we bring it down to
[1:28:31] kindergarten,
[1:28:34] it starts to set in.
[1:28:37] What do you call this?
[1:28:41] You guys are passing the test.
[1:28:44] So the correct answer could be ear. This
[1:28:47] is ear.
[1:28:49] That's title.
[1:28:51] But what's the name of my ear?
[1:28:55] Ye are the body of Christ and members in
[1:28:57] particular. You say, "Well, I'm just a
[1:28:59] member. I'm a nobody. I'm on the bottom.
[1:29:01] I'm the skin on the bottom of the sole
[1:29:02] of the foot. I'm just a little something
[1:29:04] underneath the toenail." It doesn't
[1:29:06] matter. Your name is Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:29:09] Amen. You're identified by that
[1:29:11] headship. And the body is identified by
[1:29:13] the headship. And the whole body is the
[1:29:16] body of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:26] I'm going to prepare you. I'll make
[1:29:28] another shocking statement.
[1:29:31] Not for shock effect, but just I don't
[1:29:34] always know how to eloquently express
[1:29:37] myself. But if Adam could live in two
[1:29:40] bodies, can Jesus Christ live in two
[1:29:43] bodies?
[1:29:46] Yes, sir. Amen. Can there be a
[1:29:49] bridegroom body? And can there be a
[1:29:51] bride body?
[1:29:56] This sometimes is what's so confusing
[1:29:58] about the coming of the Lord. That's
[1:30:00] right. Brother B says, "We don't look
[1:30:01] for nail scars. We look for the word
[1:30:04] made manifest."
[1:30:06] In the coming of the Lord, we know this
[1:30:08] time he's coming in bride form to
[1:30:09] express himself in bride form. Not a
[1:30:12] different person, the same person, but
[1:30:14] another form, but the same person, the
[1:30:17] same name, the same life, but another
[1:30:20] form. And so sometimes we think it can't
[1:30:23] be Jesus Christ because I haven't seen
[1:30:25] the nail prints. Listen, there is a
[1:30:28] there is a male form of that body, amen,
[1:30:31] that the fullness was wrapped in when he
[1:30:32] walked the Sea of Galilee. Where were
[1:30:34] you when he walked the Sea of Galilee?
[1:30:36] You were there. When he went to Calvary,
[1:30:37] where were you? You were there. Where
[1:30:39] was the woman when Adam was first on
[1:30:41] earth? Amen. She was there. When he was
[1:30:44] told to take dominion, she was there.
[1:30:46] When he was told to multiply and
[1:30:47] replenish, she was there. Amen. When
[1:30:50] Jesus walked the Sea of Galilee and
[1:30:51] healed the lame. Amen. Open blinded
[1:30:53] eyes. Amen. Contested the Pharisees. We
[1:30:56] were there when he went to Calvary. We
[1:30:58] were there. And what did God do at
[1:31:00] Calvary? He separated us out. Amen. And
[1:31:02] now he brought into another form. Amen.
[1:31:05] The bride form. And if Adam could live
[1:31:07] in two bodies, Jesus Christ can live in
[1:31:09] two bodies.
[1:31:11] That's why the corporal body of Jesus
[1:31:13] Christ with the nail prints, the one
[1:31:15] that Thomas saw, Amen. that one has not
[1:31:18] returned.
[1:31:22] When that body returns, he comes to set
[1:31:24] up the throne of David in the
[1:31:25] millennium. And I'm so thankful we'll
[1:31:27] see that form and worship that form and
[1:31:30] be, "Oh, I can't wait to see it." Amen.
[1:31:33] Amen. But just because that form hasn't
[1:31:36] returned doesn't mean the Lord hasn't
[1:31:37] come. That's right.
[1:31:44] We're still looking for that coming
[1:31:47] to come to set up the millennial
[1:31:48] kingdom.
[1:31:50] That's it. But he's come
[1:31:54] and the formation of his bride.
[1:31:57] It's the headship coming to the body to
[1:32:00] express himself.
[1:32:03] But what
[1:32:04] expression? What expression?
[1:32:07] Not the male expression. He already
[1:32:08] expressed that. Now he's expressing the
[1:32:12] female expression
[1:32:15] and the bride.
[1:32:19] Not necessarily a replica but
[1:32:21] complimentary part
[1:32:24] with the same life inside.
[1:32:27] Let's look at 1 Corinthians 12:12. For
[1:32:30] as the body is one and hath many
[1:32:31] members, and all the members of that one
[1:32:33] body being many, are one body, so also
[1:32:36] is Christ. Amen. I'm going to read that
[1:32:38] again slower because I've read this all
[1:32:40] my life and I I just you know how it is
[1:32:42] in the Bible when you've read it like
[1:32:44] over and over, you just read it and we
[1:32:46] miss it.
[1:32:49] For as the body is one and have many
[1:32:54] members, fingers, toes, ears, nose,
[1:32:56] mouth, all this, hair, follicles,
[1:32:58] everything. And all the members of that
[1:33:00] one body being many are one body.
[1:33:03] So also is Christ.
[1:33:07] It's not like Christ, not Christ is
[1:33:10] like, but so also is Christ.
[1:33:14] So what is Christ?
[1:33:17] Christ is a many membered body.
[1:33:21] Is that what Paul's telling us? As the
[1:33:24] body is one, but as many members and all
[1:33:26] the members make up one body, so also is
[1:33:30] Christ. Meaning Christ is a many
[1:33:33] membered body.
[1:33:36] Praise the Lord. 1 Corinthians
[1:33:38] 12:27, now you are the body of Christ
[1:33:41] and members in
[1:33:43] particular. Sir, I want to ask, how
[1:33:47] could Paul come to such a conclusion?
[1:33:51] Let's go to Acts chapter 9.
[1:33:56] Acts chapter
[1:34:00] 9 and verse
[1:34:06] three. Acts chapter 9:3.
[1:34:13] And as he journeyed, he came near
[1:34:14] Damascus, and suddenly there shined
[1:34:16] right about him a light from heaven. And
[1:34:19] he fell to the earth. And I heard a
[1:34:20] voice saying unto him, "Saul, Saul, why
[1:34:22] persecutest thou?"
[1:34:25] Me.
[1:34:27] Amen. That's right.
[1:34:30] Who was Paul persecuting?
[1:34:34] The church.
[1:34:36] We have no record where Saul ever
[1:34:38] touched Jesus Christ in the male form.
[1:34:42] Amen. No record where have he ever
[1:34:45] persecuted Jesus from I say Jesus of
[1:34:47] Nazareth just so he could understand.
[1:34:51] He never persecuted Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:34:53] He never hauled him into prison. He
[1:34:54] never he never smoked him. But what he
[1:34:56] did is after Jesus had gone, died,
[1:34:59] resurrected. Amen. Pentecost came, the
[1:35:01] church now spread its influence. Amen.
[1:35:03] Now Paul gets letters, amen, from the
[1:35:06] high priest to go into Damascus. And
[1:35:08] he's wreaking havoc on the church is
[1:35:10] what the Bible says. Hauling men and
[1:35:11] women into prison and having those
[1:35:13] executed and all kinds of things were
[1:35:15] happening. And Jesus comes and stops him
[1:35:20] with a pillar of fire because he would
[1:35:22] recognize pillar of fire. What was he
[1:35:24] not recognizing? He was not recognizing
[1:35:26] the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:32] So he knew being a Jew he would
[1:35:33] recognize pillar of fire. So he come to
[1:35:35] him in the form of pillar of fire and in
[1:35:37] the pillar of fire smoteed him down on
[1:35:39] the ground and said Saul Saul why
[1:35:41] persecutest thou me
[1:35:49] and he said who art thou Lord
[1:35:53] and the Lord said I am Jesus
[1:35:59] whom ye persecutest
[1:36:02] he didn't say I am church.
[1:36:11] Who was Paul persecuting? He was
[1:36:13] persecuting the church of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:16] And Jesus said, "You," he says, "Why are
[1:36:19] you persecuting me?" He said, "Who are
[1:36:22] you?" Amen. He didn't have another name
[1:36:25] that he could give to the female form
[1:36:27] because she can't take another
[1:36:29] identification. When he his life was in
[1:36:32] female form, he called it Jesus.
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:43] You see what this message has done for
[1:36:45] us, friends. That's why brother
[1:36:47] Brandham, after the opening of the
[1:36:48] seals, he said, "My Bible's become a new
[1:36:50] book." It's still becoming new, friends.
[1:36:52] Every day we open it. God, may God take
[1:36:54] the scales off of our eyes. Amen. We
[1:36:56] come into this world blinded to the
[1:36:58] things of God, alienated from the things
[1:37:00] of God, having our minds darkened, amen,
[1:37:02] and it takes this message, amen, to peel
[1:37:05] back the darkness so that we could see.
[1:37:07] And brother Brandham, after the opening
[1:37:08] of the seals, a man that had preached
[1:37:10] decades, read his Bible, preached all
[1:37:12] over the world, he said, "My Bible
[1:37:14] became a new book.
[1:37:21] Who are you, Lord?
[1:37:24] Where did the pillar of fire go on the
[1:37:26] day of Pentecost? Into his body.
[1:37:30] His life came into his body.
[1:37:34] And when Paul went to a city and grabbed
[1:37:37] a woman and grabbed a man and he grabbed
[1:37:39] him by the arm, who was he grabbing?
[1:37:42] Amen.
[1:37:45] Who was he hauling to prison? Who was he
[1:37:48] stoning? Who was he throwing in jail?
[1:37:51] Who was he persecuting? That's it.
[1:37:54] That's right. Amen. How many of you have
[1:37:56] a red letter Bible?
[1:38:00] I'm not the biggest fan of a red letter
[1:38:02] Bible because I think they all should be
[1:38:03] read. That's right.
[1:38:06] That's right. I mean, I use one. It's
[1:38:08] helpful sometimes, but if you have a red
[1:38:10] letter
[1:38:11] Bible, who's this talking to Paul,
[1:38:17] saying, "You know that little old lady
[1:38:19] you hauled out of that Syrian city the
[1:38:22] other day and threw her in jail. That
[1:38:25] was me.
[1:38:27] Cuz my life is behind that veil.
[1:38:30] Yes, sir.
[1:38:33] You know that man you broke in, you
[1:38:35] broke into his house and you grabbed him
[1:38:37] and you disrupted that church and you
[1:38:39] grabbed him, you hauled him to prison.
[1:38:40] You know who that was, Paul?
[1:38:43] That was me.
[1:38:45] Because my life is veiled behind that
[1:38:47] veil. Amen. This is my bride.
[1:38:53] Amen. That's right. Sometimes we say
[1:38:55] bride and bride of Christ and all these
[1:38:57] things and we in our minds we start
[1:38:59] separating things out into two different
[1:39:02] people,
[1:39:03] two different persons,
[1:39:07] but really it's two expressions
[1:39:11] of the same life
[1:39:14] which is the life of God
[1:39:17] that he wanted to express on the earth.
[1:39:19] Thank you, Lord. Let's go to Ephesians
[1:39:21] 2:19. We'll just go with this on the
[1:39:23] overhead. Now therefore, you are no more
[1:39:25] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[1:39:27] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:39:28] household of God, and are built upon the
[1:39:30] foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[1:39:32] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[1:39:34] cornerstone, and whom all the building
[1:39:36] fitly framed together growth into a holy
[1:39:38] temple of the Lord, in whom ye also are
[1:39:41] builded together for a habitation of God
[1:39:45] through the spirit. Amen. So, where does
[1:39:48] God dwell? That's right. Amen.
[1:39:54] habitation that means like where he
[1:39:55] lives.
[1:39:59] So this many membered bride all
[1:40:01] collected together is the habitation of
[1:40:04] God through the spirit.
[1:40:09] Ephesians 1, this is another one of
[1:40:11] those scriptures you got to slow down a
[1:40:13] little bit on. Ephesians 1:22. And hath
[1:40:16] put all things under his feet, and gave
[1:40:18] him to be head over all things to the
[1:40:20] church,
[1:40:23] which is his body. So what's his body?
[1:40:26] The church.
[1:40:28] The fullness. Amen. Of him. Amen. That
[1:40:32] fleth all in all. Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] So what is the
[1:40:37] church according to Paul?
[1:40:40] the fullness of him that fillth all
[1:40:43] along. Why? Because all that God was, he
[1:40:47] poured where? Into Christ. So if God
[1:40:51] emptied himself into Christ, and all
[1:40:54] that Christ was, he'd emptied into the
[1:40:56] church. Where is the fullness of him
[1:40:59] that filth all in all?
[1:41:02] Amen.
[1:41:04] Praise God. And no wonder Paul wasn't
[1:41:06] confused on this because Paul got a
[1:41:08] lesson from Jesus himself.
[1:41:13] Oh, praise God.
[1:41:16] If we go to the Peramian church age from
[1:41:18] the church age book, I want to read a
[1:41:20] section where the angel of the Lord told
[1:41:22] brother Benham to pick up his pen and
[1:41:24] write.
[1:41:25] So this isn't from brother Benham.
[1:41:31] This is from the angel. This is a
[1:41:34] message from God to the church.
[1:41:36] I'm just going to read a small portion.
[1:41:39] He said, "The first son, Adam, was the
[1:41:40] spoken seed word of God. He was given a
[1:41:42] bride to reproduce
[1:41:44] himself." That is why the bride was
[1:41:46] given to him to reproduce himself,
[1:41:50] to produce another son of God. But she
[1:41:52] fell. She fell by
[1:41:54] hybridization. She caused him to die.
[1:41:57] Amen. The second son, Jesus, also a
[1:42:00] spoken seed, word of God, was given a
[1:42:01] bride like as was Adam. But before he
[1:42:04] could marry her, she also had fallen.
[1:42:06] She, like Adam's wife, was put to the
[1:42:08] test whether she would believe the word
[1:42:10] of God and live or doubt the word and
[1:42:11] die. She doubted. She left the word. She
[1:42:14] died. From a little group of the true
[1:42:17] seed of the word, God will present
[1:42:19] Christ with a beloved bride. She is
[1:42:22] virgin of his word. She is virgin
[1:42:23] because she knows no man-made creeds or
[1:42:26] dogmas. By and through the members of
[1:42:29] the bride will be fulfilled all that was
[1:42:31] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:42:34] the virgin. That's right. Let's look at
[1:42:36] this statement again. By and through the
[1:42:38] members of the bride will be fulfilled
[1:42:41] all that was promised of God to be made
[1:42:43] manifest in the virgin. What was
[1:42:45] promised of God to be made manifest in
[1:42:47] the virgin? He says it next. The word of
[1:42:50] promise came to the Virgin Mary. But the
[1:42:52] word of promise was
[1:42:55] he himself
[1:42:57] to be made manifest.
[1:43:00] So what's coming to the virgin bride?
[1:43:02] The same thing that came to the Virgin
[1:43:04] Mary. He himself to be made manifest.
[1:43:07] How? Through the virgin bride.
[1:43:13] Says listen, he himself acted at that
[1:43:19] time. Mary didn't.
[1:43:22] act.
[1:43:25] What could Mary do to produce an
[1:43:29] immaculate conception?
[1:43:36] I don't think she could do anything.
[1:43:38] Amen.
[1:43:40] But look at what this word
[1:43:42] says. God was made manifest. He himself
[1:43:45] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[1:43:47] word of promise in the virgin. It was an
[1:43:50] angel that had brought her the message.
[1:43:52] But the angel's message was the word of
[1:43:54] God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that
[1:43:57] time all that was written of him
[1:44:00] because.
[1:44:02] Look at the because. It's a clause.
[1:44:05] Amen. It's a it's it's a clause.
[1:44:08] Because she accepted his word to her.
[1:44:13] Be it unto me according to your word.
[1:44:16] Amen. God can never force himself on
[1:44:18] anyone. God is a gentleman. What he was
[1:44:20] looking for was somewhere where his word
[1:44:22] could find a home and she would believe
[1:44:24] the word. Was she predestinated? Yes.
[1:44:27] Was she chose before the foundation of
[1:44:29] the world? Was she mighty favorite of
[1:44:31] God in heaven? Absolutely. She was all
[1:44:33] of those things. But God, amen, had to
[1:44:36] get something back from her, amen, for
[1:44:38] this prophecy to move forward. She was
[1:44:40] the chosen virgin. She was the one that
[1:44:43] he foresaw. Amen. When he had a lamb
[1:44:45] slain before the foundation of the
[1:44:46] world, he knew what womb he would come
[1:44:48] through. And he selected this virgin at
[1:44:50] an appointed time. And he sent a
[1:44:52] messenger, an angel messenger to her at
[1:44:54] an appointed time, just like he's done
[1:44:56] for you and I.
[1:44:59] Amen. He's come and washed us and
[1:45:00] restored us back to virginity, washing
[1:45:02] away all the creeds and dogmas and
[1:45:05] everything that polluted us and brought
[1:45:06] us back to himself. Amen. And brought us
[1:45:09] back to the promise of the word. And
[1:45:11] that promise of the word is he himself
[1:45:14] to be made manifest.
[1:45:17] Hallelujah.
[1:45:21] Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] And he acted at that time.
[1:45:26] And fulfilled his own word of promise in
[1:45:29] the virgin.
[1:45:31] But the angel's message was the word of
[1:45:33] God. Isaiah 9:6 says, "He fulfilled at
[1:45:35] that time all that was written of him
[1:45:37] because
[1:45:40] she accepted his word to her."
[1:45:44] Do we want Christ to fulfill all that he
[1:45:46] promised in this age? Do we want him to
[1:45:49] fulfill the promise? What is the
[1:45:51] promise? He himself to be made manifest
[1:45:54] through what? Through the virgin.
[1:45:57] Amen. Through his bride. He himself. And
[1:46:00] we want him to act at that time. And we
[1:46:02] want him to fulfill his own word. But
[1:46:04] what does he need? What does he need?
[1:46:06] What is the son of man going to find
[1:46:08] when he comes on the earth? That was the
[1:46:09] question. What will the son of man find?
[1:46:11] Will he find faith? Will he find
[1:46:14] somebody who hears the angel messenger's
[1:46:16] message to them and say, "That's nothing
[1:46:18] but the truth, brother. Be it unto me,
[1:46:21] Lord, according to your word. I'll be
[1:46:23] your bride. I'll be your dwelling place.
[1:46:25] I'll be a vessel that you can live
[1:46:27] through."
[1:46:29] Amen. Mary had no power to produce the
[1:46:32] word. Mary had no power to bring it to
[1:46:34] pass. She had no power to do anything.
[1:46:36] The only thing she had was the power of
[1:46:39] her own free choice. She had the power
[1:46:41] of free moral agency. She had a seed
[1:46:43] faith inside of her. And she had the
[1:46:45] power of a positive confession to say,
[1:46:47] "I will lay down my life. I will lay
[1:46:49] down my ambitions." Listen, this was a
[1:46:52] woman who was engaged to a man to be
[1:46:54] married. This was a 15, 16 year old girl
[1:46:56] in a backwoods place in Nazareth that
[1:46:59] was just going to the well one day. And
[1:47:01] her acceptance of this word would change
[1:47:03] her life, ruin her reputation, possibly
[1:47:06] get her put away from the man she was
[1:47:08] going to marry. She had no idea what her
[1:47:10] future prospect would be. She had no
[1:47:11] idea if anybody would believe her. She
[1:47:13] had no idea she'd be rejected by her
[1:47:15] family and cast out and called names.
[1:47:17] But at that moment, none of that
[1:47:20] mattered or entered in her mind because
[1:47:22] one thing struck her soul that that what
[1:47:24] he's telling me is the truth. And what
[1:47:27] that angel was telling her was the most
[1:47:29] impossible thing for that girl to
[1:47:30] believe,
[1:47:34] a 15, 16 year old girl from Nazareth.
[1:47:38] Can anything good come from Nazareth?
[1:47:42] That's what most people say about lime,
[1:47:44] Ohio.
[1:47:48] No mountains, no
[1:47:50] sunshine, no rivers, no
[1:47:53] lakes. Can anything good come from Lima?
[1:47:59] God help us.
[1:48:02] Lord, she had no no
[1:48:06] uh no aspiration, no accolades in the
[1:48:09] community, no support, no backup, no
[1:48:11] people in high places. She had nothing.
[1:48:14] Yeah. Come on. And going to the well one
[1:48:17] day in a normal ordinary day like she
[1:48:20] did every other day. And no doubt she
[1:48:23] was thinking about her upcoming wedding
[1:48:25] because she was betrothed to a man and
[1:48:27] wondering what her future life would be
[1:48:28] like and marriage and children and she
[1:48:31] was normal like we're normal.
[1:48:35] And all of a sudden an angel of the Lord
[1:48:37] appears to her says, "Hail thou Mary
[1:48:40] highly favored."
[1:48:42] And she was troubled in her mind at his
[1:48:47] saying. It's
[1:48:49] like I can imagine her looking around.
[1:48:55] Hail Mary, highly favored.
[1:48:59] He knows my name. And he called me
[1:49:02] highly favored. He's identifying me.
[1:49:05] Yes.
[1:49:07] Then he starts to say it's time. This is
[1:49:10] the season for the prophecy to be
[1:49:11] fulfilled.
[1:49:16] Glory to God. That's exciting. But the
[1:49:20] next statement's a little more. Yes,
[1:49:21] sir. And you're the place the prophecy
[1:49:24] will come into fulfillment.
[1:49:28] Isaiah chapter
[1:49:30] 7. She had to believe she was the word
[1:49:38] that when Isaiah said, "A virgin shall
[1:49:41] conceive." Amen. If Isaiah saw it in a
[1:49:43] vision, Isaiah saw Mary.
[1:49:46] And at that moment, she had to accept
[1:49:48] the angel's message to her. That what
[1:49:50] Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter 7 was her.
[1:49:54] She found herself in the scriptures.
[1:49:57] That scripture was her. Her
[1:49:58] identification was that word right
[1:50:00] there. That's me, mama. That's me right
[1:50:03] there. I'm looking at me in the Bible.
[1:50:07] You know how impossible this was? How
[1:50:09] unlikely. How unbelievable. Amen.
[1:50:11] There's no reason for this girl to
[1:50:13] believe that.
[1:50:16] But she believed it. That's right. Amen.
[1:50:19] And I don't know how special you were
[1:50:20] before the message came to you. And if
[1:50:22] you lived at the president's house or
[1:50:24] you were rich and but you were probably
[1:50:26] just as bad off as Mary or worse. And
[1:50:28] you probably had no standing in the
[1:50:30] community. You had no good name. You had
[1:50:32] nothing going for you. Amen. But an
[1:50:34] angel messenger come to you and said,
[1:50:35] "Guess what? This is the season for
[1:50:38] prophecy to be fulfilled. And I got
[1:50:40] something else to tell you. You're the
[1:50:41] place that it'll be fulfilled." And
[1:50:43] something inside, Amen. You might have
[1:50:46] been troubled in your mind at the
[1:50:47] greeting. You might have none. What is
[1:50:49] he trying to say? What does this mean?
[1:50:51] What is it? It's complicated. How will
[1:50:53] this happen? It's I don't understand it
[1:50:55] mechanically in my mind. She asked a
[1:50:57] legitimate question. How will this be?
[1:50:59] Seeing I know no man. She goes right to
[1:51:01] carnality.
[1:51:04] She's looking at science.
[1:51:07] How will this be knowing I know man? And
[1:51:10] he says, "Well, that's easy to explain.
[1:51:13] the Holy Ghost will overshadow you.
[1:51:16] You know, that explains
[1:51:18] nothing scientifically. That's no
[1:51:20] answer.
[1:51:23] Like she wants to know, "How is there
[1:51:26] going to be reproduction? I know no
[1:51:28] man." And he says, "Uh," and he gives
[1:51:30] her the same kind of answer Jesus always
[1:51:33] gives,
[1:51:35] elusive and spiritual.
[1:51:40] And the answer he gives doesn't satisfy
[1:51:42] the intellect. That's right. The answer
[1:51:44] he gives doesn't satisfy the mind. It
[1:51:46] doesn't calculate. It doesn't draw an
[1:51:48] equation. It doesn't answer the
[1:51:50] scientific question of how it's
[1:51:52] possible. He says, "The Holy Ghost shall
[1:51:54] ever out of you, and the thing that'll
[1:51:55] be formed in you shall be the son of the
[1:51:57] most high." And she says, "Be it unto
[1:51:59] me." That answered my question.
[1:52:02] How did that answer the question? It
[1:52:04] didn't answer it here, but it did
[1:52:06] something down here. She realized it's
[1:52:08] not your effort. It's not your power.
[1:52:10] It's not anything a man can do. This is
[1:52:13] something I'm going to do in you. And
[1:52:15] she says, "God, if that's the way you
[1:52:17] want it, then you've got a vessel right
[1:52:19] here that you can use."
[1:52:22] And that's what God is doing today,
[1:52:24] friends, he needs a vessel that he can
[1:52:26] use. He doesn't need your effort. You
[1:52:28] can't do it. You can't keep the promise.
[1:52:30] You can't be the virgin bride of Jesus
[1:52:32] Christ. You can't manifest the full life
[1:52:34] of Jesus Christ in any human effort you
[1:52:36] got whatsoever. He doesn't need your
[1:52:39] effort.
[1:52:41] You can say, "How is everything, brother
[1:52:42] Benam saying at the end time? How will
[1:52:44] it play out? What will it look like? How
[1:52:46] will we have the power? Will there be
[1:52:47] the power of spoken word? Will everybody
[1:52:49] have it? Will some have it? Will we
[1:52:51] create squirrels? What's going to
[1:52:52] happen?
[1:52:55] It's confusing.
[1:52:57] Should we all do this or should some of
[1:52:59] us do this or when should we do it?
[1:53:02] After the squeeze, before the squeeze.
[1:53:08] Come on. The reality is we have no idea
[1:53:10] what's coming next. We have little
[1:53:11] snippets
[1:53:13] just to know that there's something
[1:53:19] God, how is this going to happen? Don't
[1:53:21] worry. It'll be the Holy Ghost in you.
[1:53:25] Be it unto me according to your word.
[1:53:29] Amen. If it's the Holy Ghost going to do
[1:53:32] the work, you're then you're not asking
[1:53:33] me to do anything. You're not asking me
[1:53:35] to perform, jump through hoops, manifest
[1:53:38] anything. You're not asking me to give
[1:53:40] some fleshly evidence or make sure I can
[1:53:42] perform on a certain There's no
[1:53:44] performance she could do. There's
[1:53:46] nothing she had. There's no way she
[1:53:48] could bring it to pass. All he needed
[1:53:50] was somebody who would believe the word.
[1:53:53] And if she could believe the word and
[1:53:55] accept the word that was given to her,
[1:53:57] then he could perform what he had
[1:53:59] promised in her.
[1:54:02] What's God looking for today? He's
[1:54:04] looking for the other part of himself
[1:54:06] that will believe the word.
[1:54:13] Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham in
[1:54:15] 1958, he says the message Jesus Christ
[1:54:18] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:54:20] So now if you if I've told you the
[1:54:21] truth, Jesus Christ will work in his
[1:54:24] church and you and I just the same as he
[1:54:27] did when he was here on earth in
[1:54:29] physical body. How many knows that his
[1:54:31] physical body sits on the throne of God?
[1:54:35] And his spirit returned to the earth to
[1:54:37] live in the church to energize it as a
[1:54:39] vine through the branches.
[1:54:42] Certainly. Then he has no hands but mine
[1:54:45] and yours.
[1:54:47] He has no eyes but mine and yours. Now
[1:54:50] obviously brother Bam's talking about in
[1:54:51] this dimension.
[1:54:56] So in this dimension where's his body?
[1:55:05] What's your name?
[1:55:17] Lord. It has to go beyond intellect.
[1:55:19] Amen. Has to be a driving reality in the
[1:55:22] soul.
[1:55:25] Amen.
[1:55:26] Brother Jason last night read out of
[1:55:28] John 15:5, "I am the vine, you are the
[1:55:31] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[1:55:34] him, the same bringeth forth much fruit,
[1:55:35] but without me you can do nothing."
[1:55:37] Amen.
[1:55:40] Obviously,
[1:55:46] that's where Mary was. How shall this
[1:55:49] be? I don't know a man. I can't do what
[1:55:51] you're asking me to do.
[1:55:54] That's right. He said, "I'm not asking
[1:55:56] you to do anything. I'm asking you to
[1:55:57] believe something."
[1:56:00] Hallelujah.
[1:56:03] Amen.
[1:56:04] So good. Amen. But this is
[1:56:08] where I was woke up this morning and I
[1:56:11] started dwelling and meditating while I
[1:56:13] was still trying to go back to sleep and
[1:56:15] it didn't work. Going back to sleep
[1:56:17] didn't work. That is
[1:56:22] he
[1:56:24] said in proving his word, brother
[1:56:27] Brandham comes and he tells us that the
[1:56:29] son of man ministry will come and be so
[1:56:31] real that it'll literally unite the head
[1:56:34] and the body together. It'll bring the
[1:56:36] marriage of the
[1:56:38] lamb. He said the word will so re be so
[1:56:42] real till it'll unite the church in him
[1:56:43] as one, the bride and then she'll go
[1:56:45] home to the wedding supper. Amen. She's
[1:56:47] already united. See, we go to the
[1:56:49] wedding supper, not the marriage.
[1:56:52] Then he goes to quote part of the
[1:56:53] scripture, fill yourself with the flesh
[1:56:55] and mighty men because the marriage of
[1:56:56] the lamb has come. But the rapture is
[1:56:58] going to the wedding supper. When the
[1:56:59] word here unites with the person and the
[1:57:01] two become one and then what does it do
[1:57:04] then? It manifests the son of man again.
[1:57:07] Not the church theologian, the son of
[1:57:09] man. The word and the church becomes
[1:57:10] one. Whatever the son of man done, he
[1:57:12] was the word. The church does the same
[1:57:14] thing.
[1:57:16] Why? because she's received the same
[1:57:18] life.
[1:57:20] Amen. But this is what I've been
[1:57:21] dwelling on this morning and this is
[1:57:22] what I want to finish with. Let's go to
[1:57:24] First Corinthians 6. It'll be on the
[1:57:26] overhead. 1 Corinthians
[1:57:29] 6:19 says, "What know you not that your
[1:57:32] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost,
[1:57:35] which is in
[1:57:36] you, which you have of God, and you are
[1:57:38] not your own?"
[1:57:41] For you are bought with a price.
[1:57:44] Therefore, glorify God in your body and
[1:57:46] in your spirit, which are gods.
[1:57:51] All of these things we've been shouting
[1:57:53] about thrill our soul.
[1:57:58] But when we come down to it, it brings a
[1:58:03] responsibility. And this is what I've
[1:58:05] been meditating on this morning.
[1:58:10] See, remember we said Adam dwelt in two
[1:58:15] bodies. When the woman, which we can
[1:58:18] retroactively call her Eve, she wasn't
[1:58:21] called Eve until the fall, but we
[1:58:24] retroactively, that's fine. We could do
[1:58:27] that. when she began to mill around and
[1:58:31] talk to the serpent and get other ideas
[1:58:34] other than the ideas she was originally
[1:58:36] given and she began to entertain those
[1:58:38] ideas
[1:58:40] and discord and we know that the serpent
[1:58:42] was anointed of the devil
[1:58:45] uh and he was trying to find a way to
[1:58:49] inject himself to the human race because
[1:58:52] he could see the plan of God right the
[1:58:54] plan of God was God's attributes would
[1:58:56] be expressed on the earth as a family
[1:58:58] Amen. And if that's the way God was
[1:59:00] going to express himself, where do you
[1:59:02] think the devil wanted to express
[1:59:03] himself? He's always been hijacking
[1:59:06] God's plan. He can't come up with his
[1:59:08] own plan. So, he tries to hijack God's
[1:59:10] plan. So, if God was going to manifest
[1:59:13] himself upon the earth as a family, then
[1:59:15] now he had to find a way to inject
[1:59:16] himself into the human race so that he
[1:59:18] can manifest himself. And the whole
[1:59:21] battle from the beginning has been over
[1:59:23] expression. What life will be expressed
[1:59:26] in these humans?
[1:59:29] Amen. Come on. That's right.
[1:59:33] She
[1:59:34] began to talk to the serpent and get
[1:59:38] another idea and go another way. And he
[1:59:41] began to entice her. So she began to
[1:59:44] have lust. Now lust is not necessarily
[1:59:47] anything
[1:59:49] sensual. Lust is any strong desire that
[1:59:52] you have. I mean you can lust for a
[1:59:54] piece of cake.
[1:59:56] Doesn't have to be sexual,
[1:59:59] right? She began to lust, brother, for
[2:00:02] knowledge. She didn't know, but she
[2:00:05] wanted to
[2:00:06] know. He began to entice her and move
[2:00:10] her
[2:00:11] away. Until now, if I could say it this
[2:00:15] way, she was the
[2:00:18] branch. Adam was the vine.
[2:00:22] Amen.
[2:00:24] and the two together would bear fruit.
[2:00:30] But she took her branch and connected it
[2:00:32] to another vine
[2:00:37] and it brought forth a hybrid fruit.
[2:00:44] And this is what I'd like to propose to
[2:00:46] you.
[2:00:48] She had no right to take Adam's female
[2:00:52] form
[2:00:54] and connect it to another vine
[2:01:01] because she was not her own.
[2:01:06] She belonged to Adam. She came from
[2:01:08] Adam. She was a further expression of
[2:01:10] Adam. Her name was Adam.
[2:01:16] She had a responsibility
[2:01:18] to Adam.
[2:01:22] If that vine would have stayed connected
[2:01:24] to the right vine would branch would
[2:01:26] have stayed connected to the right vine,
[2:01:27] it would have brother Bam said it would
[2:01:28] have brought forth Christ.
[2:01:34] And I'm going to make another shocking
[2:01:36] statement. It may not have been Jesus
[2:01:39] Christ. It might have been Abel Christ
[2:01:43] and then Seth Christ
[2:01:46] and then Ron Christ and then Chad Christ
[2:01:49] and then Sam Christ and Susie Christ
[2:01:52] because Christ is the anointed word when
[2:01:54] it comes into manifestation. And it was
[2:01:56] going to be the attributes of God as a
[2:01:58] family upon the earth. All the lineage
[2:02:01] of Christ.
[2:02:03] I don't know that for a fact. I'm not
[2:02:04] teaching that as doctrine. But just
[2:02:05] think, friends, brother Bam said you
[2:02:07] would have come forth. That's right. He
[2:02:10] said, "But you now come wrong.
[2:02:13] But you come anyhow, although you come
[2:02:15] wrong, but you should have come right."
[2:02:19] And what would you have been if you
[2:02:20] would have come right? You would have
[2:02:22] been Christ, the manifested word, the
[2:02:24] attribute of God manifest on the earth,
[2:02:26] the family of God, Christ.
[2:02:30] Hallelujah. We came wrong. So now he's
[2:02:34] making it right.
[2:02:36] Thank you, Lord. So the woman had no
[2:02:39] right to take Adam's spirit and Adam's
[2:02:43] body and join it to another vine.
[2:02:48] It's why the church had no right
[2:02:52] to take their branch and connect it to
[2:02:54] another vine to bring forth a hybrid
[2:02:57] mongrel product.
[2:03:00] That's good. Amen. That's right.
[2:03:03] The same thing's true for you and I,
[2:03:05] friends. Amen. If we're going to shout
[2:03:07] and scream that we're the body of Christ
[2:03:09] and we're Mrs. Jesus Christ and we're
[2:03:11] the temple that he dwells in and we're a
[2:03:13] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost and we're
[2:03:15] built the habitation of God, we have no
[2:03:17] right to take these bodies and connect
[2:03:19] it to any other vine.
[2:03:22] We have a responsibility to one
[2:03:24] headship, one husband. We're to be
[2:03:25] faithful to one man and that's our
[2:03:28] bridegroom. And brother Bam said, "Who's
[2:03:30] the bridegroom?" The revealed word.
[2:03:33] This headship that's come down. Amen.
[2:03:36] That's the only vine that we're to be
[2:03:38] connected to is this message of this
[2:03:40] hour. Amen. This bridegroom, the
[2:03:41] revealed word that's been restored to
[2:03:43] us. The headship that has come to the
[2:03:45] body to guide the body. That's our
[2:03:47] identification. But we have a
[2:03:49] responsibility to that identification.
[2:03:51] For we're not our own. We've been bought
[2:03:53] with a price. Therefore, glorify God in
[2:03:56] your spirit and in your body, which are
[2:03:58] gods.
[2:04:01] Listen, we realize because of
[2:04:03] hybridization, Brother Bam says you've
[2:04:05] got a sticky cocker burner nature
[2:04:06] that'll bother you the rest of your
[2:04:07] life.
[2:04:09] And we can say amen.
[2:04:11] You know, you're three parts of you, but
[2:04:13] the outer two parts of you are
[2:04:14] corrupted.
[2:04:16] And the soul of you came separated from
[2:04:18] God and had to be regenerated, go
[2:04:20] through a new birth by the baptism of
[2:04:22] the Holy Ghost to spring the life that
[2:04:24] was trapped inside into life. So the
[2:04:26] only part of you that's connecting to
[2:04:27] God, amen, is that is God is that seed
[2:04:30] that's in the soul that's come to life
[2:04:32] and it's buried beneath these two outer
[2:04:34] realms and these two outer realms, amen,
[2:04:36] are so susceptible to the things of the
[2:04:38] world to pollutions and entertainments
[2:04:41] because it's got that injected into it.
[2:04:43] And it got injected into it at the fall.
[2:04:46] Lust came in, pride came in, rebellion
[2:04:48] came in. Everything that was in the
[2:04:50] nature of Lucifer got injected in
[2:04:52] because he found a way to bring his life
[2:04:55] into the human race so he could have
[2:04:57] expression.
[2:05:03] So the battle is over expression.
[2:05:07] And where is the greatest battle ever
[2:05:08] fought?
[2:05:12] Thoughts. And then but this is what the
[2:05:16] devil chose to use. But God's watchtower
[2:05:18] is down in the soul.
[2:05:21] When the word can drop down into the
[2:05:23] soul and come to life, then it can take
[2:05:24] dominion over the battle in the mind. So
[2:05:26] we only can overcome by the word. That's
[2:05:29] right. Never by stronger thinking.
[2:05:35] Because then you're in the devil's
[2:05:37] watchtower. His control tower is the
[2:05:38] mine. You can't combat thought with
[2:05:40] thought. You can only combat thought
[2:05:41] with word. Amen.
[2:05:46] Amen. That from the soul. And these
[2:05:49] outer two realms are so susceptible to
[2:05:51] the world. Attracted to things that we
[2:05:53] don't want to be attracted to.
[2:05:55] Bent towards things that we don't want
[2:05:57] him to be bent towards. Has lusts and
[2:06:00] cravings and desires that we don't want
[2:06:01] it to have.
[2:06:03] That's right.
[2:06:06] Why? Because the battleground now is
[2:06:09] you.
[2:06:17] Listen,
[2:06:19] we're not fighting
[2:06:20] anybody or anything
[2:06:23] anywhere.
[2:06:27] You know, if you think you're fighting
[2:06:28] the denominations, you're already duped.
[2:06:31] Amen. You're not fighting doctrines or
[2:06:34] other churches or other people or the
[2:06:37] world or you know where the battle's at.
[2:06:41] right here.
[2:06:44] Do you know who your greatest enemy is?
[2:06:47] The man you look at in the mirror.
[2:06:50] Not your neighbor who's throwing junk in
[2:06:52] your yard or not the coworker who's
[2:06:54] spreading gossip about you. That's not
[2:06:56] your enemy. Amen. Your enemy is the man
[2:06:59] you look at in the mirror. The enemy is
[2:07:00] these outer two realms. What are we
[2:07:02] supposed to conquer? We're supposed to
[2:07:04] conquer this.
[2:07:06] And we realize there's so many of us. We
[2:07:08] just can't wait to get to millennium. I
[2:07:10] want to rule and reign with Christ.
[2:07:11] Amen. I've been faithful at least. He'll
[2:07:12] make me ruler over cities. How in the
[2:07:14] world is he going to make you a ruler
[2:07:16] over a city or a region if you can't
[2:07:18] take care of this little lump of dirt
[2:07:19] that he's given you?
[2:07:23] He's given you about a 150 200 lbs of
[2:07:26] dirt out of the ground. And all he's
[2:07:28] asking you to do is bring this dirt and
[2:07:30] dominion to his word. And we're failing
[2:07:32] miserably.
[2:07:34] We're not ready for the millennial reign
[2:07:36] to rule cities until we can rule this
[2:07:39] dirt.
[2:07:41] Amen. And what do I got to do? I got to
[2:07:43] bring every thought captive to the
[2:07:45] obedience of Christ. Amen. And bringing
[2:07:47] down, Amen. strongholds. We don't fight
[2:07:50] the warfare with the way the enemy
[2:07:52] fights in any carnal thing, our
[2:07:53] thoughts, our self-helps. We fight it
[2:07:55] with what? The word of God. And bring
[2:07:57] every thought subject to the obedience
[2:07:59] of Christ, which is the
[2:08:01] word. and bring this thing
[2:08:06] subject
[2:08:08] to the word
[2:08:13] so when I tell you your name's Jesus.
[2:08:16] Amen. You're the bride of Christ. Amen.
[2:08:18] You're an eagle flying out. Amen. You're
[2:08:20] taking amen. But don't realize that
[2:08:23] comes with a responsibility.
[2:08:27] And God has never taken away our free
[2:08:30] moral agency. And he lets us fall and
[2:08:32] bump our nose and we get scratched up
[2:08:34] and we get banged up so we can learn.
[2:08:38] Hey, listen. We We're all, Brother Jason
[2:08:42] said it last night, we're all in this
[2:08:43] together.
[2:08:46] We're all getting bruised and battered
[2:08:48] and banged up, making mistakes, getting
[2:08:50] ashamed of ourselves, embar embarrassing
[2:08:52] ourselves. But I say, grace be to God
[2:08:54] for every bit of it. Make me ashamed of
[2:08:57] my flesh. Make me ashamed of my
[2:08:58] thoughts. Make me ashamed of my pride.
[2:09:00] make me utterly ashamed of arrogance and
[2:09:03] everything self-p protection,
[2:09:05] self-preservation. I want to go the way
[2:09:07] of Christ. Amen. Christ was able to
[2:09:09] bring this body of his subject
[2:09:11] completely to the father. He said, "I
[2:09:12] never do anything unless the father
[2:09:14] shows me first." He didn't take his own
[2:09:16] ideas, his own thinking, his own
[2:09:18] desires. He surrendered them all to the
[2:09:20] father and the father manifest through
[2:09:22] him.
[2:09:26] When when he was in the garden of
[2:09:27] Gethsemane, brother Brandham said he won
[2:09:30] back Eden in Gethsemane.
[2:09:35] How did he win back Eden?
[2:09:37] Because the Eid's fall came when the
[2:09:41] other vessel was tempted because of
[2:09:44] their own desire. And she was drawn away
[2:09:47] of her own lust. Amen. And she was
[2:09:49] deceived by her own desire. Amen. and
[2:09:51] she went for something other than the
[2:09:53] word, other than the will of God. And
[2:09:56] that's how Eden was lost. And he said he
[2:09:58] won back Eden in Gethsemane. How did he
[2:10:01] win back Eden in Gethsemane? Because
[2:10:03] brother Brandham said the greatest
[2:10:05] battle he ever had was in Gethsemane
[2:10:08] where he sweated in agony as it was
[2:10:10] great drops of blood. Would he obey the
[2:10:13] father and go to Calvary or would he
[2:10:15] stay with his disciples what he wanted
[2:10:17] to do?
[2:10:19] Amen. That's right. I think it's so
[2:10:21] amazing. The prophet told us this that
[2:10:23] Jesus himself had a desire. He had a
[2:10:26] love. He loved those brethren. He wanted
[2:10:28] to stay with them. He's coming in
[2:10:29] Gethsemane. He you can see his desire
[2:10:32] saying, "Father, if it's possible, let
[2:10:35] this cup pass from me." Why is he saying
[2:10:37] that? He's not just, you know, he's not
[2:10:39] just dramatizing something to have some
[2:10:41] extra scriptures.
[2:10:44] He's in agony and travail. He comes back
[2:10:47] to his disciples says, "Can you not pray
[2:10:50] with me one hour?
[2:10:52] Don't you know I'm dying here?
[2:10:57] He's so distraught. He's so tormented.
[2:11:00] He's so
[2:11:04] human. That's it. Would he go to
[2:11:07] Calvary?
[2:11:09] Or would he stay with his disciples and
[2:11:12] Gethsemane? He's come to a Y on the
[2:11:14] road." Amen. Would he do, brother said,
[2:11:17] would he stay with his what he wanted to
[2:11:20] do?
[2:11:21] Would he do what he wanted to do or
[2:11:24] would he do what the word says?
[2:11:32] We think of Jesus and perfect man,
[2:11:35] everything
[2:11:36] perfect, but he was in such distraught
[2:11:39] that he came three times
[2:11:42] and asked the same question. Amen.
[2:11:46] If I said, "Father, if it's possible,
[2:11:49] let this cup but nevertheless,
[2:11:52] not my will."
[2:11:57] What victory did he have in Gethsemane?
[2:12:01] He had the victory over his own desire
[2:12:05] and he made a full surrender to the will
[2:12:08] of the father.
[2:12:11] And when he won that victory in
[2:12:13] Gethsemane, he won back Eden. That's
[2:12:16] right.
[2:12:22] What do you think God's asking of us?
[2:12:26] He brings up his bride in Satan's season
[2:12:27] where you can have anything you want.
[2:12:31] Click, click,
[2:12:34] click. My wife, she had to order
[2:12:37] something the other day.
[2:12:39] It's gotten so bad when she needs
[2:12:41] something from the grocery store, she
[2:12:42] just grab her phone. Boom, boom, boom,
[2:12:43] boom. Three hours later, something's on
[2:12:45] the
[2:12:48] porch. She loves
[2:12:53] it. Come in Satan's Eden. And in Satan's
[2:12:56] Eden, when it's come to the pinnacle of
[2:12:58] Satan's Eden, where he'll give you
[2:13:00] anything you want,
[2:13:02] the click of the button at your
[2:13:03] fingertips, everything you lust after or
[2:13:05] desire, everything you want, it's all
[2:13:07] available to you. And he brings a bride
[2:13:10] in this hour to be tested. That's it. To
[2:13:14] be tested by self-love,
[2:13:18] self-preservation, self-will.
[2:13:21] That's right.
[2:13:24] Brother said, "This Eve will face the
[2:13:26] temptation just like the first Eve."
[2:13:29] And then after the prophet leaves the
[2:13:30] scene, we're tested with time,
[2:13:33] time and prosperity and everything you
[2:13:36] want in Satan's Eden in Leodysia.
[2:13:40] And the question is, will he have a
[2:13:41] bride? Amen. That will give up
[2:13:44] everything she wants
[2:13:48] for his word.
[2:13:51] Will he have a bride that says, "Not my
[2:13:53] will, but thine will be done. I'll dress
[2:13:55] the way you want. I'll talk the way you
[2:13:57] want. I'll use these eyes to look at
[2:13:59] what you want. I'll feed on what you
[2:14:01] want. Every hey, whatever you want,
[2:14:03] that's what you're going to get because
[2:14:05] I'm not my own. I've been bought with a
[2:14:07] price by the precious blood of Jesus
[2:14:08] Christ. You own all of me and you have
[2:14:11] every right to me. And I have ne I have
[2:14:13] no right to take what your precious
[2:14:15] blood purchased and use it for anything
[2:14:17] of the devil. I surrender myself to you.
[2:14:23] Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:25] Brother Bear makes this statement in the
[2:14:27] end time evangelism. He said, "Look at
[2:14:29] Samson. God could only use what you
[2:14:32] surrendered to him."
[2:14:35] Samson was a big strong man. He had a
[2:14:37] lot of strength. Samson surrendered his
[2:14:39] strength to God, but he wouldn't give
[2:14:41] his heart. Gave his heart to
[2:14:44] Delilah. God's a gentleman. He won't pry
[2:14:47] out of your hands anything.
[2:14:51] He gives you the opportunity to lay it
[2:14:53] down. Amen.
[2:14:55] Little
[2:14:57] compromises, things that aren't
[2:14:58] pleasing, ways of thinking,
[2:15:01] self-preservation, self love pride and
[2:15:05] jealousy and envy. Amen. Lust of the
[2:15:08] eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of life.
[2:15:11] He doesn't pry it out of our hands. He
[2:15:13] didn't pry it out of Jesus's hand.
[2:15:17] He gave him the chance to wrestle
[2:15:18] himself into subjection.
[2:15:21] And God in this end time is giving us
[2:15:23] the opportunity to wrestle ourselves
[2:15:25] into subjection.
[2:15:29] Amen. Amen.
[2:15:32] How many of us love him
[2:15:34] enough? Say, God, I want to love you
[2:15:36] enough
[2:15:39] that you get all of me. If you want a
[2:15:42] body to work through, I want to give it
[2:15:45] to you more than Sunday and Wednesday.
[2:15:49] If you need a vessel of clay to manifest
[2:15:51] yourself in, I want you to have more
[2:15:53] than 15 minutes a day.
[2:15:57] I want you to have my thoughts, my eyes,
[2:16:00] my ears. I want you to have everything
[2:16:02] of me. Amen. If this is the word and
[2:16:06] this is the hour and I'm part of the
[2:16:07] manifestation,
[2:16:09] I say be it unto me according to your
[2:16:11] word. Come rejection, misunderstanding,
[2:16:15] loss of life, loss of everything I ever
[2:16:18] wanted, my goals and my ambitions, I
[2:16:20] give it up
[2:16:22] for you.
[2:16:25] But Christ is the mystery of God
[2:16:27] revealed. He says, "Oh, if we can get
[2:16:29] prisoners like that,
[2:16:32] how was Paul a prisoner?" What chains
[2:16:34] bound Paul? It was love chains.
[2:16:38] What was wrapped around him that held
[2:16:40] him to Christ no matter what? Stoned,
[2:16:42] rejected, hated of his brethren, falsely
[2:16:44] accused men in the church, other
[2:16:46] ministers saying things about him,
[2:16:48] stealing his disciples, going around and
[2:16:50] corrupting his churches.
[2:16:52] Amen. What held him to Christ? His
[2:16:54] chains of love.
[2:16:58] Oh, if God can get him prisoners like
[2:17:00] that, now that's when he can express the
[2:17:04] preeminences.
[2:17:05] You see, he's got the man or the person
[2:17:07] so that he knows nothing but Christ. You
[2:17:09] get what I mean? That's secondly, first
[2:17:12] express himself completely God in
[2:17:14] Christ. Second, to have the preeminence
[2:17:16] by this in his church, which is his
[2:17:18] body, the bride, till he could have the
[2:17:20] preeminence to express himself through
[2:17:23] them.
[2:17:26] I say, "God,
[2:17:28] that's what I want."
[2:17:32] In the beginning, he had one plan, one
[2:17:35] goal, one secret in his mind that he
[2:17:38] wanted to achieve. One thing that he's
[2:17:40] been working through these last 6,000
[2:17:43] years that he's trying to achieve. And
[2:17:46] that one thing has three parts to it.
[2:17:49] The first part is preeminence in a man.
[2:17:50] He's already completed that. But the
[2:17:53] second part of that is preeminence in a
[2:17:56] people.
[2:17:58] So that means this. If I could just sum
[2:18:01] it up with this. All that God thought
[2:18:04] and all that he wanted, the thoughts he
[2:18:06] had of himself, his desire for
[2:18:07] expression and everything God wanted to
[2:18:10] accomplish comes down to one thing.
[2:18:13] Amen. Him getting preeminence of me.
[2:18:21] That's right. That's right. That's
[2:18:22] right. Because we're in the second fold
[2:18:24] of the three-fold plan of God.
[2:18:28] And if he doesn't get preeminence of me,
[2:18:30] then he can't complete the second fold.
[2:18:34] And he's not going to pry it out of my
[2:18:35] hands or force anything.
[2:18:38] He's waiting for my surrender.
[2:18:43] I'm going to finish, I think, with this
[2:18:45] quote.
[2:18:47] No, I'm sorry, two more.
[2:18:51] Amen. And humble thyself. He says, you
[2:18:53] know, people want power.
[2:18:56] And really, they don't know what power
[2:18:57] is. They don't really know what goes
[2:19:00] with it. The way up is down always. If
[2:19:03] you want power, see how humble you can
[2:19:04] get. Just get away from your all your
[2:19:07] worldly thinking and humble yourself
[2:19:09] before God. Then you've got more power
[2:19:10] than the man that runs all over the
[2:19:12] building and makes a big lot of noise
[2:19:14] because you have been able to conquer
[2:19:16] yourself
[2:19:18] and commit yourself to Christ. You see,
[2:19:21] to humble yourself before him, that's
[2:19:24] real power.
[2:19:27] So what if we got power to do all kinds
[2:19:30] of other things, but we can't conquer
[2:19:32] this thing. Amen. Yeah.
[2:19:36] You said, "You show me the church that's
[2:19:37] humble, real humble, not arrogancy. A
[2:19:39] church just a sweet, humble church, I'll
[2:19:42] show you a church that has favor and
[2:19:43] power of God in it." That's right. That
[2:19:46] That's the thing. It takes humility,
[2:19:48] humbling ourselves before God. Letting
[2:19:50] God just work through us. Don't have to
[2:19:53] make a lot of noise.
[2:19:58] In the message, Christ is the mystery of
[2:19:59] God revealed. This is this is the the
[2:20:02] quote that gives me the most consolation
[2:20:04] in the whole world. Cuz friends, I fail
[2:20:07] all the time. Amen. That's right. He
[2:20:10] said, "Denominations won't ever touch
[2:20:12] that. It's a revelation. She knows it.
[2:20:14] So did Eve know it, but she fell. But
[2:20:17] this one knows it and won't fall."
[2:20:20] She is ordained. Hallelujah. Woo. She is
[2:20:24] ordained not to fall.
[2:20:27] She won't fail. She's predestinated to
[2:20:31] it.
[2:20:35] Why? Because he's washed her with the
[2:20:38] water of the word so that he can present
[2:20:39] to himself a bride without spot or
[2:20:42] wrinkle or blemish. What does he need?
[2:20:44] He needs our surrender. He needs our
[2:20:47] emptying out. Brother Bam said, "You
[2:20:49] don't pack up for this journey. You
[2:20:50] empty out." He said the problem is we
[2:20:52] get too strong. It's not being too
[2:20:53] strong. It's getting humble and weak and
[2:20:55] being a vessel that he can use. No mind
[2:20:58] of our own, no ambition of our own, no
[2:21:00] desire of our own. But let all our
[2:21:01] desire be him and him only.
[2:21:04] And we failed a thousand times. We may
[2:21:07] fail a thousand times more. But praise
[2:21:09] God, this generation is not going to end
[2:21:11] until he accomplishes his purpose
[2:21:13] because she's predestinated to it. She
[2:21:16] won't fail. She can't fail.
[2:21:21] Can you fail? I fail. Will you fail? We
[2:21:23] can fail. He can't fail.
[2:21:26] and his word can't fail.
[2:21:29] So we may bump our nose a thousand times
[2:21:31] more, but that's just training us to
[2:21:35] someday not bump our nose
[2:21:39] in the same spot. We may stub our toe
[2:21:42] over and over again, but eventually
[2:21:44] we're going to walk around that thing
[2:21:46] we've stubbed our toe. Yes, sir. We may
[2:21:49] have church problems and family problems
[2:21:50] and personal issues, but praise God,
[2:21:53] there's coming a day and we're going to
[2:21:54] eventually surrender to this word and
[2:21:57] stop bumping our toe, falling on our
[2:21:59] face. We're just going to surrender.
[2:22:02] Say, God, not my way, but your way. God
[2:22:06] bless you. Let's bow our heads together.
[2:22:09] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[2:22:12] Father, while we realize what you've
[2:22:15] done for us is beyond belief, Lord. It's
[2:22:18] beyond human belief. It's beyond human
[2:22:20] concepts or
[2:22:22] intellects. But God, there's something
[2:22:24] in our soul that knows it's true. Amen.
[2:22:28] You've called us to this hour that we're
[2:22:31] part of your plan. We're part of your
[2:22:32] body. It's your life in us.
[2:22:37] Father, you're asking us to surrender.
[2:22:42] God, this position that you've placed us
[2:22:44] in comes with responsibility.
[2:22:48] Forgive us Lord
[2:22:50] for sherking the
[2:22:53] responsibility. Forgive us Lord for not
[2:22:56] being
[2:22:58] diligent. Forgive us where we've failed
[2:23:00] and become laxed and
[2:23:03] lazy, selfserving and prideful. Forgive
[2:23:06] us,
[2:23:08] Lord. God, we realize you don't need our
[2:23:11] ability cuz we have none.
[2:23:15] You don't need our efforts. You don't
[2:23:17] need our mind, our think. You just need
[2:23:21] us
[2:23:22] to surrender to
[2:23:24] you. You need a place where your word
[2:23:27] can
[2:23:28] grow. Where your image can be
[2:23:30] manifested, a place, Lord, that you can
[2:23:32] sew your seed of your word into. And a
[2:23:36] garden that will bring forth abundant
[2:23:38] fruit to
[2:23:40] you. Lord, your bride is a fruitful
[2:23:43] garden
[2:23:44] that you have planted with all the seeds
[2:23:47] of your word. Lord, in the Song of
[2:23:50] Solomon, the bride said, "Come into your
[2:23:53] garden. Come into your
[2:23:55] garden, God. We want to invite you to
[2:23:57] come into your
[2:23:59] garden. Come into the garden of our
[2:24:01] hearts and our lives. Sew your seeds,
[2:24:03] Lord, and let them bring forth bountibly
[2:24:05] to you.
[2:24:07] May you enjoy your garden and may you be
[2:24:09] glorified in it, Lord.
[2:24:12] God, we don't want to have our way. We
[2:24:14] want to have your
[2:24:15] way. Help us, God, to take the
[2:24:18] responsibility and surrender ourselves
[2:24:20] to you. Yes, we love you. We thank you,
[2:24:23] God, for this day and for your
[2:24:25] people. Lord, bless us and help us as we
[2:24:29] surrender to you fresh again. as we
[2:24:32] consecrate ourselves to you all over
[2:24:34] again, Lord, so that you can come and do
[2:24:36] what we're not capable of doing. So you
[2:24:39] can come and live your life through us.
[2:24:41] We surrender to you in Jesus Christ's
[2:24:44] name. Amen. Amen. And God bless you all.
[2:24:47] Amen.
[2:24:48] [Applause]
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:25:00] All I can say is yay and amen.
[2:25:05] That was good stuff.
[2:25:07] Did you see yourself?
[2:25:11] Do you see the prophecy of this hour? Do
[2:25:14] you see why God's calling you? Yes. Do
[2:25:16] you see? It's just about you
[2:25:18] surrendering.
[2:25:22] Amen. Listen, th those that are going to
[2:25:26] help serve and go prepare the food.
[2:25:28] You're dismissed right now. If you would
[2:25:30] just go ahead and go to to help. We're
[2:25:33] going to have a meal here in just a
[2:25:36] minute. I want to say that that word
[2:25:38] that was has been spoken both by brother
[2:25:42] Jason and brother Chad.
[2:25:45] Wow.
[2:25:47] That's good stuff.
[2:25:50] That's strong meat.
[2:25:52] I tell you what it was. It was prime
[2:25:55] rib.
[2:25:58] You got that. It's prime rib. It come
[2:26:00] right right out of the sight of God.
[2:26:04] Amen. Let's all stand together, please.
[2:26:08] Be it unto me according to thy word.
