[52:19] him and said suffered little children
[52:21] to come unto me and forbid them not for
[52:24] of such is the kingdom of God verily I

[57:08] to take whatever he has placed within my
[57:11] heart
[57:13] to be able to transfer it
[57:19] that's what the holy spirit's supposed
[57:21] to do to the word
[57:23] because the word within itself is a dead
[57:26] letter
[57:28] but when the Holy Spirit takes that word
[57:31] it makes it alive it becomes a living
[57:33] reality
[57:37] father

[1:00:20] 29. for thou art my lamp O Lord and the
[1:00:25] Lord will light my darkness
[1:00:28] for by Thee I have run through a troop
[1:00:31] by my God have I leaped over a wall as
[1:00:36] for God his way is perfect the word of
[1:00:40] the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all
[1:00:44] them that trust in him for who is God
[1:00:47] save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our
[1:00:51] God God is my strength and power and he

[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:10] God is my strength and power
[1:01:13] and he maketh my way
[1:01:18] perfect
[1:01:21] amen Ada put a smile on every one of
[1:01:24] your faces this morning I don't care
[1:01:26] what kind of Trials you're going through
[1:01:28] I don't care what you're facing but
[1:01:30] listen when you follow him he makes your
[1:01:33] way perfect Hallelujah Matthew Chapter 5
[1:01:37] if you would Matthew 5 verse 48.
[1:01:44] Jesus
[1:01:46] speaking to
[1:01:48] his disciples there
[1:01:50] Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect
[1:01:55] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:01:59] is perfect
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:07] turn with me if you would to the book of
[1:02:09] Hebrews chapter 5.
[1:02:12] Hebrews 5
[1:02:16] 12-14 then we'll read Hebrews 6 1-2
[1:02:20] Hebrews
[1:02:22] chapter 5
[1:02:24] verse 12.
[1:02:27] for when for the time you ought to be
[1:02:29] teachers
[1:02:31] you have need that one teach you again
[1:02:33] which be the first principles
[1:02:36] of the Oracles of God and are become
[1:02:38] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:02:41] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[1:02:43] is unskillful in the word of
[1:02:46] righteousness for he is a babe
[1:02:50] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[1:02:53] are of full age
[1:02:56] even those who be by reason of use
[1:03:00] notice the word of God it's very
[1:03:02] explicit
[1:03:04] those who are full of age
[1:03:07] who by reason of use
[1:03:10] you have their senses
[1:03:13] exercised to discern both Good and Evil
[1:03:19] 6 verse 1.
[1:03:21] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:03:24] doctrine of Christ
[1:03:27] let us go on unto perfection
[1:03:31] not laying again the foundation of
[1:03:33] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:03:37] towards god of the doctrine of baptisms
[1:03:41] and of the laying on of hands and of the
[1:03:44] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[1:03:48] judgment
[1:03:49] this will we do if God permit
[1:03:54] may God permit it this morning I pray in
[1:03:58] Jesus name amen may God bless his word I
[1:04:02] would like to
[1:04:03] title my sermon
[1:04:05] and it's something that I want you to
[1:04:07] understand
[1:04:08] of what God is doing right now
[1:04:12] we see what God has done
[1:04:15] many times we look forward to what God
[1:04:18] will do but we miss what God is doing
[1:04:22] and as it was in the days of Jesus
[1:04:25] Christ himself
[1:04:27] we know there came a time when his
[1:04:29] ministry changed
[1:04:31] when it was no longer the attraction
[1:04:34] was no longer the feeding the thousands
[1:04:38] with a couple loaves of bread and some
[1:04:42] fish but it was a time of Separation
[1:04:46] there came a time when God was no longer
[1:04:49] causing all of them to gather but now
[1:04:53] they were coming to the threshing floor
[1:04:56] and God began to separate and we are now
[1:05:00] in a time of Separation we can see it
[1:05:04] it's a time that the shuck is no longer
[1:05:07] air with the wheat
[1:05:08] and so
[1:05:10] um I want to not only talk about the
[1:05:14] ministry of Jesus Christ and the
[1:05:17] ministry of the prophet of this hour
[1:05:21] but about the last day Ministry we want
[1:05:24] to talk about the ministry of the bride
[1:05:27] and I want to title it this morning the
[1:05:31] bride is now moving
[1:05:33] into a Perfection Ministry
[1:05:38] and I take a subject by faith
[1:05:42] the bride is moving into his perfection
[1:05:48] catch that into his perfection
[1:05:52] now
[1:05:55] I remember as a young Christian
[1:05:58] having read where Jesus said
[1:06:02] be ye perfect as your father in Heaven
[1:06:05] is perfect
[1:06:07] and as a young man I thought well
[1:06:10] if he said it I guess that's what we
[1:06:13] need to do and so I can remember
[1:06:15] thinking all right today I'm going to
[1:06:18] have a perfect day
[1:06:21] I'm gonna keep everything under control
[1:06:25] I'm going to do everything that I can to
[1:06:28] have a perfect time before God
[1:06:31] and let me tell you just shortly after
[1:06:34] getting out of bed
[1:06:36] everything falls apart
[1:06:38] and you realize that this Perfection
[1:06:41] that you're trying to achieve or attain
[1:06:45] to in the flesh is so very elusive
[1:06:49] huh
[1:06:52] you may think you're perfect
[1:06:55] until a trial comes
[1:06:58] somebody cuts you off
[1:07:01] uh somebody jumps in front of you at the
[1:07:04] the bank somebody cuts in line
[1:07:08] I said that's when you need to have
[1:07:10] character
[1:07:14] amen otherwise it'd be heaps of Ashes
[1:07:16] everywhere
[1:07:19] God doesn't want you to misuse his power
[1:07:22] maybe you will say I forgive you
[1:07:27] that's okay go ahead and cut in front of
[1:07:30] me and be rude but I forgive you
[1:07:33] anyway I've always been intrigued
[1:07:37] by the subject of perfection
[1:07:42] because it's something that God requires
[1:07:47] and each one of you must be perfect as
[1:07:50] your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:07:53] and I've always
[1:07:55] pondered over this and and wondered
[1:07:58] within my heart what does it mean to be
[1:08:01] perfect before God
[1:08:05] and one thing that I can say with an
[1:08:09] assurity in my heart
[1:08:11] if God said for us to be perfect
[1:08:15] then there is a way that God has made
[1:08:18] for us to attain perfection
[1:08:21] God will never ask you or require of you
[1:08:25] something
[1:08:26] for you to do without giving you the
[1:08:29] ability to be able to come to that
[1:08:34] he doesn't want everyone to flunk
[1:08:37] he doesn't rejoice when people miss it
[1:08:41] so there must be a way because he is
[1:08:43] Jehovah Jireh he is a God that provides
[1:08:47] for all of our needs and if you need a
[1:08:50] way to be able to be perfect in the eyes
[1:08:52] of God then God must provide a way for
[1:08:55] that perfection
[1:09:03] if God in heaven is perfect
[1:09:07] then he's expecting us to have that same
[1:09:09] perfection
[1:09:11] but he must provide the way now brother
[1:09:13] Branham
[1:09:15] in 1954 begins to now
[1:09:19] illustrate to us how God is going to do
[1:09:23] this and he titles his sermons
[1:09:26] accordingly here is a sermon called God
[1:09:29] perfecting his church
[1:09:32] 1954. so we give God praise tonight to
[1:09:36] know that the holy spirit is in US
[1:09:39] last night I was teaching of the
[1:09:41] perfection
[1:09:43] God perfecting his church
[1:09:46] bringing the church into Perfection
[1:09:49] through the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] notice his wording
[1:09:55] he's bringing the church through
[1:09:58] something
[1:10:00] so this is how God will do it
[1:10:02] that's how we being dead in Christ take
[1:10:06] on Abraham's seed as heirs according to
[1:10:10] the promise and we are perfected not in
[1:10:13] our own selves not in our own holiness
[1:10:17] someone said to me not long ago brother
[1:10:20] Branham do you believe in Holiness I I
[1:10:23] said yes sir without such no man shall
[1:10:25] see God
[1:10:27] I said but not my holiness
[1:10:30] because I
[1:10:32] have not any I believe in his holiness
[1:10:37] something that he has done
[1:10:39] and it's that I rest my hopes upon not
[1:10:44] in my own merits
[1:10:45] I have none
[1:10:47] I rest upon his merits having this
[1:10:51] assurance as he loves me I love him and
[1:10:54] the whole thing becomes a love affair
[1:10:57] it's not because of the law it's because
[1:10:59] of love
[1:11:01] to fully understand what God is telling
[1:11:04] us then we've got to go to the scripture
[1:11:06] but though we read the scripture and we
[1:11:09] look of what he he talks about
[1:11:11] perfection it still takes the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit to come and make this alive to us
[1:11:17] because we want to know how can we be
[1:11:21] perfect before God
[1:11:24] and I began to look at several men
[1:11:27] within the scriptures
[1:11:29] the Bible says was a perfect man
[1:11:34] there are four examples within the word
[1:11:37] one is Noah
[1:11:38] one is Abraham and one is job
[1:11:42] all of those were said they were perfect
[1:11:44] before God
[1:11:46] but there is a fourth one
[1:11:48] that is very perplexing his name is
[1:11:51] called or his title is the king of Tyrus
[1:11:57] his name is Lucifer
[1:12:03] the Bible says in Ezekiel 28 verses
[1:12:06] 12-15
[1:12:08] son of man take up a lamentation
[1:12:12] upon the king of Tyrus
[1:12:15] and say unto him thus saith the Lord God
[1:12:18] thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom
[1:12:22] and perfect in Beauty
[1:12:25] now may I stop there for a moment the
[1:12:28] prophet of God told us that God dwells
[1:12:32] in character not in Beauty
[1:12:36] so whoever this is
[1:12:39] what his Perfection is is in Beauty
[1:12:43] but the beauty of Christ is the
[1:12:46] character
[1:12:47] of Christ in the people
[1:12:51] thou has been in Eden in the garden of
[1:12:53] God
[1:12:54] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:12:57] the sardius the topaz and the diamond
[1:13:00] the Burl the Onyx and the Jasper the
[1:13:03] sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle
[1:13:05] and gold and the workmanship of thy
[1:13:08] tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in
[1:13:12] thee in the day that thou was created
[1:13:15] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:13:17] covereth
[1:13:18] and I have set thee so thou West upon
[1:13:23] the holy mountain of God thou Hast
[1:13:25] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:13:28] stones of fire
[1:13:30] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[1:13:34] day thou was created till iniquity
[1:13:36] was found in thee
[1:13:39] and so here was a man the king of Tyrus
[1:13:43] it does not give us his name in the
[1:13:46] scripture so brother Branham picks this
[1:13:49] very scripture up and in 1959 questions
[1:13:52] and answers watch this
[1:13:54] watch the evil controls the world now as
[1:13:59] we read from Ezekiel 28-12
[1:14:03] verse 12. son of man take up the
[1:14:05] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[1:14:08] say unto him
[1:14:09] and we read that scripture now you know
[1:14:12] the king of Tyrus at that time could
[1:14:14] have not have been in Eden
[1:14:17] for it was four thousand years before
[1:14:20] that see thou has been in Eden who's he
[1:14:24] talking to he's talking to Satan in that
[1:14:29] King
[1:14:31] Hallelujah brother I feel religion
[1:14:33] religious and if you go on there in the
[1:14:37] next couple quotes the brother Branham
[1:14:39] says you know what his name is his name
[1:14:42] is Lucifer
[1:14:46] and so you have three
[1:14:50] there are three men and another man and
[1:14:55] he was perfect in his ways but until
[1:14:58] iniquity
[1:15:00] was found in him
[1:15:02] so
[1:15:04] the first time in the Bible that a man
[1:15:06] was called perfect is found in the Book
[1:15:09] of Genesis Genesis 6 verse 9. these are
[1:15:14] the generations of Noah Noah was a just
[1:15:17] man and perfect in his generations and
[1:15:21] Noah walked with God
[1:15:23] Perfection there comes from the Hebrew
[1:15:26] word tomam
[1:15:29] it means entire without blemish complete
[1:15:33] full perfect undefiled
[1:15:36] an upright
[1:15:39] before God
[1:15:42] and then I began to look up the word
[1:15:45] perfect in the New Testament
[1:15:48] it is called teleos
[1:15:51] in Greek
[1:15:54] and it means having reached an end
[1:15:59] come to a destination
[1:16:02] reached your goal
[1:16:06] now I want all of you to understand that
[1:16:08] God has called you unto himself
[1:16:13] and each one of you have
[1:16:16] a Godly positioning system within you
[1:16:20] just like your cell phone has a GPS your
[1:16:24] car has a GPS
[1:16:27] that is a system that man has made
[1:16:30] and through satellites which are false
[1:16:34] Stars
[1:16:35] and things of information but all of a
[1:16:38] sudden you go outside you turn your GPS
[1:16:41] on and through trigonometry it does uh
[1:16:46] all of these equations and finds out
[1:16:49] within just less than two or three feet
[1:16:52] where you're at
[1:16:56] follow this now
[1:16:57] now God has put not a GPS not a global
[1:17:03] but a Godly positioning system in each
[1:17:07] one of your lives
[1:17:09] and regardless of how many wrong turns
[1:17:12] you make
[1:17:14] what happens when you make a wrong turn
[1:17:16] on a regular GPS
[1:17:20] it recalculates
[1:17:23] so I want you to understand it doesn't
[1:17:25] matter how many times that you have to
[1:17:28] recalculate hopefully you're not making
[1:17:31] that many
[1:17:33] but when you do God knows and he's going
[1:17:37] to bring you to destination he's going
[1:17:40] to bring you to teleos to the goal to
[1:17:45] the destination to the place that he has
[1:17:48] chosen God has provided a way
[1:17:53] God would be unjust for him to ask you
[1:17:56] to be perfect and there's no way for you
[1:17:59] to achieve it
[1:18:02] he would make you all very frustrated
[1:18:06] and and and and depressed
[1:18:10] because he wants me to be perfect and if
[1:18:13] there's any of us here that are really
[1:18:16] honest with ourselves we see
[1:18:19] I know I am not
[1:18:21] perfect
[1:18:25] are there any honest people
[1:18:28] oh there's more honest over here than
[1:18:30] over here how about any
[1:18:37] oh God help us
[1:18:41] Noah the Bible says what's just in an
[1:18:43] upright man
[1:18:45] up until this time as Generations had
[1:18:48] been pure and undefiled before God
[1:18:51] I want to look at another scripture as
[1:18:53] we just kind of walk along this morning
[1:18:56] in Genesis chapter 17 verse 1.
[1:19:01] and when Abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:19:05] the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto
[1:19:09] him I am the almighty God
[1:19:13] when you look up the word almighty God
[1:19:16] that name it means El Shaddai
[1:19:19] I am the breasted one I am the
[1:19:22] all-sufficient god
[1:19:25] walk before me
[1:19:29] and be thou perfect
[1:19:32] wow I want you to understand here is El
[1:19:36] Shaddai the all-sufficient god coming to
[1:19:39] Abram
[1:19:41] here before the promise was even brought
[1:19:44] to pass in his life before the seed came
[1:19:48] forth here El Shaddai I want you to
[1:19:50] understand that God knows what you're
[1:19:53] going through he knows the situation you
[1:19:57] face but you have to put your trust in
[1:20:00] God that he that called you is bringing
[1:20:03] you to your destination if he asks you
[1:20:06] to be perfect he's got to make a way
[1:20:15] the Lord appeared to him as El Shaddai
[1:20:20] God was looking at his faith and could
[1:20:22] see his faith transformed itself into
[1:20:24] words and by his Works was his faith
[1:20:28] made perfect
[1:20:30] how many of you know that
[1:20:32] that it wasn't until he was taking the
[1:20:36] knife to slay his son
[1:20:41] and he can you imagine now the quandary
[1:20:46] that Abraham is going through
[1:20:49] he waits all those years for the promise
[1:20:52] to come to pass and then God tells him
[1:20:55] to go up the mountain to the place I
[1:20:58] will show you of
[1:20:59] and I want you to go there and sacrifice
[1:21:02] your son
[1:21:03] I want to ask you does the the god of
[1:21:06] the Old Testament believe in human
[1:21:09] sacrifice
[1:21:12] think of this
[1:21:14] and so here Abraham is he's he's
[1:21:18] searching through his mind how can God
[1:21:22] who is The Giver of Life and the promise
[1:21:25] and I've waited and it was by an Angel
[1:21:27] and and the visitations of God and I'm
[1:21:31] going to have a son and now I finally
[1:21:33] have the son and he wants me to to
[1:21:36] sacrifice my own son
[1:21:40] and the Bible says and he went to the
[1:21:42] place
[1:21:43] that he had seen in a vision he goes to
[1:21:47] the place and when he sees the place so
[1:21:49] far off he tells the the other men the
[1:21:53] young boys that were with him you stay
[1:21:55] here I in the lad will go and make
[1:21:58] sacrifice and we shall reach he's
[1:22:02] prophesied
[1:22:03] he's already under the anointing of God
[1:22:06] I don't understand it I don't know how
[1:22:08] God is going to do it but if he asks me
[1:22:11] to do it it is me to say yea and amen
[1:22:21] Isaac says I
[1:22:24] I see the altar I see the wood
[1:22:28] by the way he carried his own wood up
[1:22:30] the mountain
[1:22:32] Christ carried his own wooden cross
[1:22:35] you see the type
[1:22:37] father
[1:22:38] I see the altar I see the wood
[1:22:42] where
[1:22:44] is the sacrifice
[1:22:48] he says God will provide
[1:22:51] himself
[1:22:55] a sacrifice
[1:22:58] I want you to understand that when you
[1:23:00] understand biblical principles
[1:23:03] God will ask you to maybe go somewhere
[1:23:06] and go to a place it's not so much as
[1:23:08] strategic location it may be a time in
[1:23:11] your life
[1:23:12] oh I'm to the place
[1:23:15] and then understand that God has called
[1:23:18] you to the place and he gave you a
[1:23:19] purpose he was to go and sacrifice
[1:23:25] and when you get those two lined up
[1:23:29] you'll know that God will provide
[1:23:32] but the lamb that was caught in the
[1:23:35] thicket
[1:23:37] in the Briars
[1:23:39] it wasn't there until the first two
[1:23:42] lined up I'm at the place I know the
[1:23:45] purpose
[1:23:47] and all of a sudden he takes his hand
[1:23:51] Isaac gets there
[1:23:54] and he takes the power to the to the
[1:23:57] hand and then God speaks stay thy hand
[1:24:01] Abraham
[1:24:02] for now I know
[1:24:05] thou death love me
[1:24:08] wait a second you mean the omnipotent
[1:24:11] God
[1:24:12] an omniscient God who knows all things
[1:24:16] does not know that Abraham loves him
[1:24:19] does he have to wait what it is is
[1:24:23] Abraham has to prove his love to God
[1:24:28] and then God said I receive it
[1:24:32] and it's imputed unto you for
[1:24:34] righteousness
[1:24:36] I want you to understand how faith
[1:24:39] is a gift of God
[1:24:42] but it must be put into action
[1:24:45] faith without works is dead
[1:24:49] you tell me you have faith I must see
[1:24:52] the works of God in your life otherwise
[1:24:55] it's just a profession
[1:24:59] it must be a possession it must be
[1:25:01] something that you actually say if I'm a
[1:25:04] Believer I want to see fruits
[1:25:07] John the Baptist said you say that
[1:25:10] you've repented bring forth fruits of
[1:25:12] repentance
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:20] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:25:24] works is the outward manifestation of
[1:25:27] your faith
[1:25:28] your works as Faith expressed
[1:25:32] James 2 verses 21 through 26 was not
[1:25:37] Abraham Our Father justified by works
[1:25:43] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[1:25:45] the altar
[1:25:47] seeth thou how Faith wrought with his
[1:25:51] works and by works was Faith made
[1:25:55] perfect
[1:25:57] here's that word perfection
[1:26:02] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:26:04] saith Abraham believed God that's what
[1:26:07] believers do they believe
[1:26:10] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:26:13] righteousness
[1:26:14] and he was called the friend of God
[1:26:17] you see then how by works a man is
[1:26:20] Justified
[1:26:22] and not by faith only because otherwise
[1:26:26] we could all say okay okay it's all
[1:26:28] Faith it's all Revelation it's all God
[1:26:31] doing it so therefore I'm going to sit
[1:26:32] back and all I got to do is to say it's
[1:26:35] faith and then I don't do nothing about
[1:26:37] putting my faith into action
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:45] you just become a a lazy
[1:26:50] person that says well it's all Grace
[1:26:53] it's nothing but Grace and therefore
[1:26:56] I'm just going to because God's doing it
[1:26:59] and you don't put your faith into action
[1:27:05] and not by faith only likewise also was
[1:27:09] not Rahab the Harlot justified by works
[1:27:14] and you know what I want to ask you her
[1:27:16] Works was to lie when she hid
[1:27:18] The Messengers
[1:27:21] what happened to him well they went that
[1:27:23] way
[1:27:25] well they went that way
[1:27:30] she lied
[1:27:32] you mean God could have somebody to lie
[1:27:35] and still be in the will of God be
[1:27:37] careful
[1:27:41] and for as the body without the spirit
[1:27:44] is dead
[1:27:46] so faith without works is dead show me a
[1:27:50] man who claims to believe God
[1:27:53] and I will show you a man that his faith
[1:27:55] will be manifested in his actions his
[1:27:59] word and his walk
[1:28:01] when we talk about walking with God
[1:28:04] your Christian walk is all inclusive in
[1:28:07] its meaning
[1:28:08] it means in everything in all manner of
[1:28:11] life
[1:28:13] and of speech
[1:28:15] and of actions and the daily life all of
[1:28:19] that is Walking with God we just don't
[1:28:22] walk on Sunday morning
[1:28:24] we don't come here to church and put on
[1:28:26] our halo
[1:28:28] and act so holy
[1:28:30] you know I've had people come here to
[1:28:32] church
[1:28:33] and you know somebody has testified to
[1:28:36] him and they've come and they feel a
[1:28:39] little out of place among such a holy
[1:28:42] people
[1:28:44] have you ever heard that before somebody
[1:28:46] maybe witnessed to somebody off of the
[1:28:48] street and they come in here and they go
[1:28:50] oh I feel so odd because the people are
[1:28:54] so holy
[1:28:57] and then you tell them we see that
[1:28:59] sister over there you should have seen
[1:29:01] what she was like before God got it see
[1:29:03] this brother over here he was a drug
[1:29:04] dealer see this guy over there no you're
[1:29:07] just looking at a washed up product
[1:29:10] one is God is cleansed huh because there
[1:29:14] for the grace of God go I
[1:29:16] it was God that watched over you it was
[1:29:19] God that cleanse you there ain't nobody
[1:29:21] in here that's holy there ain't nobody
[1:29:23] in here that's got some kind of Halo it
[1:29:26] was everything that you did no God knew
[1:29:29] he would have faults and failures and
[1:29:31] yet God made a way for you to be perfect
[1:29:34] before him
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:38] so just join the group
[1:29:41] ain't nobody here
[1:29:44] was born with a Halo
[1:29:49] amen
[1:29:52] stop there for a moment
[1:29:55] whenever God
[1:29:57] speaks to Abraham it says in God Appears
[1:30:00] unto Abraham
[1:30:03] and it causes Abraham
[1:30:06] to bring forth a manifestation
[1:30:09] every time God Appears to Abraham he
[1:30:12] pulls another word attribute out of him
[1:30:17] in Genesis 12 God speaks to him to move
[1:30:21] out of his country and away from his
[1:30:23] family to seek a city whose Builder and
[1:30:27] maker is God is that right
[1:30:29] and so God Appears to him the Bible says
[1:30:32] and God Appears to him and he builds an
[1:30:35] altar
[1:30:37] and altars were built
[1:30:40] in the Old Testament as a place of
[1:30:42] sacrifice brother Brown says find altars
[1:30:45] in the Old Testament and I'll show you a
[1:30:47] church
[1:30:49] I'll show you somewhere where people are
[1:30:53] coming to make sacrifice
[1:30:55] that's why we're coming here this
[1:30:57] morning
[1:30:58] you could have stayed home
[1:31:00] you could have streamed the service you
[1:31:03] could have stayed in your bedroom and
[1:31:06] washed it from your bed in your pajamas
[1:31:09] but you had to make a sacrifice
[1:31:12] amen going to church is a commitment
[1:31:15] serving God is a commitment forsake not
[1:31:19] the assembling together of the brethren
[1:31:21] in this last days why we come here why
[1:31:24] because we are committed to the cause of
[1:31:27] Christ
[1:31:28] we make a sacrifice and I say to all of
[1:31:32] you thank you for your sacrifice
[1:31:35] and without a sacrifice there's no
[1:31:38] blessing
[1:31:43] God Appears to him and he builds an
[1:31:46] altar
[1:31:47] Alters the type of church because he
[1:31:50] calls the place Bethel
[1:31:53] meaning the house of God
[1:31:56] so when God Appears to Abraham he begins
[1:31:59] to call upon the name of the Lord and
[1:32:01] that appearing is what caused him to do
[1:32:03] it
[1:32:04] that's the first time that Abraham calls
[1:32:08] on the name of the Lord
[1:32:10] so this appearing had to call
[1:32:14] this calling out of him
[1:32:17] when God calls you he calls you out of
[1:32:20] your family
[1:32:21] he calls you out of all of these things
[1:32:23] to say I bid you to come come unto me
[1:32:26] come unto me O ye that are weary in her
[1:32:29] heavy lead I will give you rest
[1:32:34] but actually when you come to become a
[1:32:37] disciple for Christ
[1:32:39] he says he who seeks to save his life
[1:32:41] shall lose it but he who seeks
[1:32:46] to lose his life she'll find it there's
[1:32:49] a cost to being a disciple
[1:32:52] it's called Death to sell
[1:32:56] and he who loves father mother sister
[1:32:58] brother more than me
[1:33:01] is not worthy of the Kingdom
[1:33:06] if there had been no appearing
[1:33:09] there would be no manifestation in
[1:33:11] Abraham's life
[1:33:13] so I want you to understand
[1:33:16] the word appear in Hebrew it actually
[1:33:18] means is the word Raw r-a-a-h
[1:33:22] it means to see to discern to experience
[1:33:27] to catch the vision of and God appeared
[1:33:32] unto Abraham and what God is doing
[1:33:36] giving him the ability to see something
[1:33:39] to discerning to experience it
[1:33:44] to catch the vision of it
[1:33:48] Abraham was actually Experiencing God
[1:33:52] he was Discerning God
[1:33:55] he was catching
[1:33:57] a vision of God
[1:33:59] I want you to understand
[1:34:02] that he was having this experience
[1:34:06] and when he God Appears to him the next
[1:34:08] thing is he has a desire to go to church
[1:34:12] and to call on the name of the Lord
[1:34:16] it was God's appearing to him
[1:34:19] that caused that word attribute to come
[1:34:21] out of him
[1:34:23] let me be so bold as to say each one of
[1:34:26] you
[1:34:27] as God Appears to you now let's take
[1:34:30] this appearing
[1:34:31] and call it a revealing an unveiling
[1:34:37] a time when Faith Comes upon you
[1:34:41] what it is is when God Appears at that
[1:34:43] time he's bringing another portion of
[1:34:46] himself something that was deep inside
[1:34:50] the seed do you understand what he's
[1:34:53] doing he's bringing the life which is
[1:34:55] his life out of the seed causing you to
[1:34:59] do something and you might not even
[1:35:01] known it was there but God rich in Mercy
[1:35:04] knowing that that sea Gene is down
[1:35:08] inside of you and when the light shines
[1:35:10] upon that seed if it is ordained to life
[1:35:13] because children of life
[1:35:17] are energized by light
[1:35:22] Hallelujah
[1:35:24] there is a we learned in in in biology
[1:35:29] that plant life has a way to take
[1:35:33] sunlight
[1:35:34] and to change it into energy
[1:35:37] it is called photosynthesis
[1:35:41] in other words the cells on the leaves
[1:35:44] of the trees and the plants and the
[1:35:47] flowers and everything that has botany
[1:35:50] life
[1:35:51] when the light strikes it
[1:35:56] it begins to come forth what is it it is
[1:35:59] photosynthesis what is happening to you
[1:36:02] sitting here right now is God giving you
[1:36:05] light God giving you understanding
[1:36:08] because when God opens your mind and the
[1:36:11] light turns off and you catch it guess
[1:36:14] what it's causing life
[1:36:26] sister Jen Oldham
[1:36:29] when
[1:36:31] I first met her you you all remember
[1:36:34] sister Jan
[1:36:35] and
[1:36:37] everything she uh she sewed the clothing
[1:36:40] for the Catholic church that she was a
[1:36:43] member of
[1:36:43] and Dennis of course he had married her
[1:36:45] and everything like that well they they
[1:36:48] kind of had this thing well if I go to
[1:36:49] your church will you go to mine yeah
[1:36:51] kind of a Let's Make a Deal thing
[1:36:55] and so she comes to church
[1:36:58] and she sits there with her hoop
[1:37:01] earrings
[1:37:02] and her makeup
[1:37:04] and everything because you know what
[1:37:06] she's a good Catholic okay she's a good
[1:37:09] person
[1:37:11] just doesn't know any different
[1:37:14] so she sits there and she comes to meet
[1:37:16] me after service I'll have you
[1:37:19] points your finger I'll have you to know
[1:37:25] and I don't care what you say you're not
[1:37:28] going to change me I saw the clothing
[1:37:30] for our priests I go in and guess how
[1:37:34] many rituals that our priest does to put
[1:37:37] on the clothing
[1:37:38] before service and yeah wow okay great I
[1:37:42] don't have any special clothing and
[1:37:44] there's nothing anointed about this tie
[1:37:49] so anyway she comes to church a few
[1:37:52] times everything and I'm watching and
[1:37:55] the earrings are gone
[1:37:58] nobody told her
[1:38:00] nobody pointed her finger nobody said oh
[1:38:03] my God
[1:38:05] she has earrings
[1:38:08] no hey quit looking you're down your
[1:38:11] nose to somebody before God gives them
[1:38:22] string in this hour
[1:38:27] so she met me after church after a
[1:38:29] couple months of coming and this and
[1:38:31] that what are you doing to me
[1:38:36] we are doing something
[1:38:38] I don't know what it is but you're doing
[1:38:41] something
[1:38:42] no let me tell you it was not me doing
[1:38:44] it what it was was God by way of the
[1:38:47] Holy Spirit giving her an appearing and
[1:38:50] when the appearing is coming it's
[1:38:52] flashing the light upon the seed and
[1:38:54] when it does she comes forth off go the
[1:38:57] earrings off go the clothing off to
[1:38:59] those things what is it it's God pulling
[1:39:02] the life
[1:39:05] nobody can change you except God
[1:39:11] you can change your church you can
[1:39:13] change how you believe
[1:39:17] but it takes God to change your heart
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:30] in Genesis 18 we see Abraham again in
[1:39:34] the plains of memory God Appears to him
[1:39:37] and he has foot washing and communion
[1:39:39] with Melchizedek and he pays ties
[1:39:44] do you see the attributes how did he
[1:39:47] know how to pay tithes
[1:39:53] I'll tell you what because there was
[1:39:55] something in the lines of Abraham
[1:39:57] Levi
[1:39:59] was saying pay ties
[1:40:02] because the Bible says Levi yet in the
[1:40:04] loins of Abraham
[1:40:06] whoa you mean to tell me God see Gene is
[1:40:11] down inside and even before it was
[1:40:14] manifest there was something in Levi in
[1:40:17] an unmanifested seed yet to come to life
[1:40:21] was already telling Abraham pay ties
[1:40:26] hello
[1:40:31] Melchizedek
[1:40:33] ever who he was
[1:40:35] he still is
[1:40:38] because there was no beginning of days
[1:40:41] or end of life
[1:40:47] oh I tell you every time God Appears to
[1:40:49] his children
[1:40:51] something happens
[1:40:53] I'm asking God God appear to someone
[1:40:57] here this morning
[1:40:59] in a special way to show them give them
[1:41:01] Revelation give them understanding
[1:41:05] that the Bible will become alive to them
[1:41:08] and that Bible will become a living
[1:41:11] epistle
[1:41:17] some people will never come to church
[1:41:21] but they will look to you for a life you
[1:41:24] live
[1:41:27] um
[1:41:29] they may never walk in these doors
[1:41:33] but they may look at your life and say I
[1:41:35] don't know what it is about you
[1:41:38] but I want whatever you got
[1:41:43] Lord
[1:41:44] let me live a life
[1:41:47] before the people
[1:41:50] that the people see number one that I
[1:41:52] have Joy about what I believe
[1:41:56] huh
[1:41:57] to be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1:42:01] not lemon juice
[1:42:04] not a Sour Puss
[1:42:06] but something that it's joy unspeakable
[1:42:10] and full of Glory there's something
[1:42:12] inside of me that every time God Appears
[1:42:15] guess what Hallelujah
[1:42:18] amen it quickens and energizes me what
[1:42:21] is it doing the same thing it did to
[1:42:23] Abraham the same thing that it did to
[1:42:25] every seed genocide it's pulling the god
[1:42:29] life that's hidden
[1:42:31] that's invisible that is placed there
[1:42:34] inside of you before the foundation of
[1:42:36] the world you didn't even know it
[1:42:43] who is this Melchizedek
[1:42:45] who do you say this is
[1:42:48] God manifesting himself once again
[1:42:52] to the promised son God does this for a
[1:42:55] purpose to get a bride ready for the
[1:42:58] rapture
[1:43:00] God had to come down make a way for
[1:43:02] Abraham and for Sarah to change their
[1:43:04] bodies
[1:43:06] Abraham could no longer produce the seed
[1:43:10] impossible Sarah's womb as good as dead
[1:43:15] in their flesh it was no longer possible
[1:43:18] to bring forth the promised seed and I
[1:43:21] want all of you to understand understand
[1:43:23] this biblical principle
[1:43:25] when it's impossible for man
[1:43:29] it's probable for God
[1:43:33] Waits until you
[1:43:35] can't produce it are you done Abraham
[1:43:40] have you tried everything yeah I
[1:43:42] listened to Sarah went into Hagar
[1:43:45] brought forth a wild man can't even get
[1:43:48] him to go to church all he does is make
[1:43:50] fun of
[1:43:51] come on
[1:43:53] yeah

[1:48:14] come to the completeness
[1:48:17] so turn with me
[1:48:19] also Acts chapter 26 we'll see another
[1:48:22] time when God Appears and this time it's
[1:48:25] Saul the Pharisee
[1:48:31] Saul the Pharisee
[1:48:34] a Pharisee of Pharisees concerning the
[1:48:37] law blameless
[1:48:41] that song years ago
[1:48:44] brother Johnny the brother from Tucson
[1:48:46] he once there was a little high tempered
[1:48:50] hook nose to you who was a doctor of
[1:48:52] much degree he spent many years under
[1:48:56] well-trained men getting his PhD well on
[1:49:01] the road to Damascus one day there the
[1:49:04] pillar of of fire met Saul
[1:49:10] what happened
[1:49:12] down in the dust
[1:49:14] where he belongs what happened God
[1:49:17] meeting an elect seed huh
[1:49:24] do you remember when God came to you
[1:49:28] how many of you were actually looking
[1:49:30] for God God came looking for you
[1:49:34] he said no man seeks God
[1:49:37] he says God seeks man
[1:49:41] so here it is Acts chapter 26 15-18
[1:49:46] and I said now here's this appearing
[1:49:50] here's a pillar of Fire
[1:49:53] and here is a Pharisee of Pharisees
[1:49:56] taught by the greatest teacher of his
[1:49:58] day by Gamaliel
[1:50:01] and I said who art thou Lord
[1:50:04] and he said I am Jesus
[1:50:07] whom thou persecutest
[1:50:11] but rise and stand upon thy feet
[1:50:14] for I have appeared unto thee for this
[1:50:18] purpose
[1:50:19] I want you to understand every time God
[1:50:21] Appears it has a purpose every time God
[1:50:24] give you Revelation every time light
[1:50:28] shines upon your seed it has a purpose
[1:50:32] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:50:35] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:50:37] and of those things which I will appear
[1:50:40] unto thee
[1:50:45] the delivering thee from the people
[1:50:49] and from the Gentiles
[1:50:53] unto whom now I said thee
[1:50:56] to open their eyes
[1:50:58] to turn them from Darkness to light and
[1:51:02] from the power of Satan
[1:51:05] to God
[1:51:07] wow
[1:51:11] Satan
[1:51:13] is a mighty power
[1:51:16] but God
[1:51:18] Is An Almighty
[1:51:21] how much greater is light than Darkness
[1:51:24] I don't care how dark it is I don't care
[1:51:27] how dark you were shaded how many times
[1:51:31] how many how much education how much
[1:51:34] stuff how much unbelief was shrouded
[1:51:38] over that seed
[1:51:40] when Jesus met the woman at the well
[1:51:44] and the more that he spoke my words that
[1:51:47] I speak unto you
[1:51:51] they are life
[1:51:55] and the words that I speak are the light
[1:51:57] of men
[1:51:59] brother random said as he began to speak
[1:52:01] to her light penetrated
[1:52:03] the light penetrated going through her
[1:52:05] unbelief and all of the darkness and all
[1:52:08] of this and everything and well when the
[1:52:11] Messiah comes watch
[1:52:14] something when the Messiah comes
[1:52:18] he'll tell us these things
[1:52:20] she's already lights penetrating
[1:52:22] something inside of her is being pulled
[1:52:26] out of her
[1:52:27] and she can't help it she doesn't know
[1:52:29] why she's speaking you're not even
[1:52:30] supposed to be talking to Amy
[1:52:35] do not custom
[1:52:38] but the Bible says he it needs to go by
[1:52:40] way of Samaria
[1:52:42] he sent the disciples away
[1:52:45] boy you talk about them missing a a time
[1:52:48] when God's appearing to an elect seed
[1:52:50] they come back and does he know who he's
[1:52:53] talking to
[1:52:56] I imagine that's how it was when
[1:52:59] somebody started testifying to you
[1:53:02] know who he's talking to
[1:53:05] that's the worst one in the church
[1:53:08] yeah well I tell you what it was an
[1:53:10] appearing
[1:53:12] and as the light from the word of God
[1:53:14] began to penetrate the woman at the well
[1:53:19] said that when the Messiah comes he'll
[1:53:21] tell us these things woman
[1:53:24] I say unto thee that the man that speaks
[1:53:26] to you
[1:53:28] is he
[1:53:32] and the Bible says and she left her
[1:53:34] water pot
[1:53:36] very reason she went to the well
[1:53:41] had to ask me of this water
[1:53:45] she got her water pot filled
[1:53:49] not the physical water pot she got this
[1:53:52] living water within her that sprung up
[1:53:54] and she left the water pot she run into
[1:53:56] the City come see a man come see a man

[2:00:08] is don't you care that we perish
[2:00:11] right
[2:00:17] why didn't you wake him up before you
[2:00:19] were in trouble
[2:00:21] saints of God there are times in your
[2:00:23] life
[2:00:25] when you let him sleep when you should
[2:00:26] have first thing you did was wake him up
[2:00:29] and realize that your ship may not be
[2:00:32] able to go through this
[2:00:35] master
[2:00:37] care is not that we perish
[2:00:40] and he stood there on the bow of the
[2:00:42] boat
[2:00:43] he rebuked the wind
[2:00:45] and the waves
[2:00:51] what manner
[2:00:54] of man is this
[2:00:57] that the Seas and the wind obey him
[2:01:01] I know the master
[2:01:04] do you understand there are times in
[2:01:06] your life
[2:01:07] when you're going to have to speak to a
[2:01:09] storm
[2:01:11] you're going to have to speak to
[2:01:13] something in your life that is
[2:01:14] devastational that may take your boat
[2:01:16] and you may sink it all you got to do is
[2:01:19] put your faith and trust in God
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:30] brother ramp says in 1962 convinced and
[2:01:33] then concern
[2:01:35] he's in our midst now
[2:01:38] there's a great big difference in the
[2:01:41] sign of Jesus appearing and Jesus coming
[2:01:45] two different words
[2:01:47] means two different things the appearing
[2:01:50] of the Lord and the coming of the Lord
[2:01:53] the appearing of the Lord is now
[2:01:55] somebody say now
[2:01:57] that's what's happening God's doing many
[2:01:59] appearings he's appearing to you and he
[2:02:01] appears and he does and he comes on the
[2:02:03] scene he gives you revelation God is
[2:02:05] appearing now
[2:02:08] and when he's appearing in his feeble
[2:02:10] his Spirit working among them proving
[2:02:12] that it's in him that it's him with them
[2:02:16] getting them ready for the rapture
[2:02:20] for the coming of the Lord to catch away
[2:02:22] is right see the appearing in the coming
[2:02:26] God
[2:02:27] you have been appearing to this little
[2:02:30] elect lady called The Bride many
[2:02:33] appearings but only three comings
[2:02:37] so we look down through the Bible and we
[2:02:41] see many appearings
[2:02:43] but there's only three comings
[2:02:46] now I'm asking God in every one of your
[2:02:49] lives that he might appear unto you at
[2:02:51] some time to make you aware that he's
[2:02:54] with you
[2:02:59] and sometimes it takes a place of
[2:03:01] desperation for you to call him on the
[2:03:04] scene and when he does he lets you know
[2:03:06] I was there all the time
[2:03:14] God told Abraham to be thou perfect and
[2:03:16] walk before him in perfection
[2:03:21] there was another man his name was job
[2:03:24] 1 1.
[2:03:27] there was a man in the land of us whose
[2:03:29] name was job and that man was perfect
[2:03:31] and upright
[2:03:33] and one that feared God and has skewed
[2:03:35] evil
[2:03:38] twice God spoke to the enemy and said
[2:03:40] have you actually considered my servant
[2:03:42] job
[2:03:45] hmm
[2:03:46] both times he mentions job was a perfect
[2:03:49] and upper amen
[2:03:51] you see I want you to understand
[2:03:54] that in the midst of all that he went
[2:03:56] through job realized I am a failure I
[2:04:00] curse the day I was born and said
[2:04:03] because he was going through issues
[2:04:06] do not let the issues obscure your
[2:04:09] vision
[2:04:11] of who's with you
[2:04:13] but when it was all over he said though
[2:04:16] the skin worms eat my flesh in my flesh
[2:04:20] I will see God and when God gets done
[2:04:23] with me I shall come forth as pure gold
[2:04:27] amen amen this is for somebody this
[2:04:30] morning
[2:04:32] now watch
[2:04:33] Melchizedek the office of the high
[2:04:36] priest
[2:04:39] that God uses as a mediator between God
[2:04:42] and man Jesus and understand this Jesus
[2:04:45] was the man
[2:04:47] the sacrificial lamb but Melchizedek was
[2:04:51] the office
[2:04:53] of that man
[2:04:54] now follow this along in the sermon who
[2:04:57] is this monkey
[2:04:59] he says now he says he came in and lived
[2:05:02] in that person of Melchizedek
[2:05:04] he never heard we never heard no more of
[2:05:08] Melchizedek because
[2:05:10] he became Jesus Christ
[2:05:13] Melchizedek was the priest
[2:05:16] but he became
[2:05:18] Jesus Christ
[2:05:21] um
[2:05:22] now if he's the high priest the Bible
[2:05:24] says in Hebrews 4 follow along Hebrews 4
[2:05:27] verses 15 14 through 5 verse 1. seeing
[2:05:32] then that we have a great high priest
[2:05:34] that has passed into the heavens
[2:05:37] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[2:05:41] our profession
[2:05:43] for we have not and high priest which
[2:05:46] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[2:05:48] our infirmities
[2:05:50] but was in all points tempted like as we
[2:05:54] are
[2:05:55] I want all of you to understand he went
[2:05:58] through every trial so he knew what you
[2:06:01] would feel like
[2:06:03] yet without sin
[2:06:06] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[2:06:08] Throne of God
[2:06:10] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[2:06:12] to help in time of need
[2:06:16] for every high priest taken from among
[2:06:19] men is ordained for men in things
[2:06:21] pertaining to God
[2:06:23] that he may offer both gifts and
[2:06:26] sacrifices
[2:06:28] for sin
[2:06:29] the role of the high priest was to be a
[2:06:32] mediator between God and man
[2:06:34] and through that mediator we have an
[2:06:36] ability to approach God
[2:06:39] First Timothy 2 verses 5 and 6 for there
[2:06:42] is one God and one mediator between God
[2:06:44] and man
[2:06:45] the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as
[2:06:48] a ransom for all to be testified in due
[2:06:51] time
[2:06:52] oh my
[2:06:54] now
[2:06:57] give me a couple minutes so I want to
[2:06:59] read to you just a couple more things
[2:07:02] but it's going to be lengthy reading so
[2:07:04] I want you to open your Bibles Hebrews
[2:07:06] chapter 9. Hebrews 9 and we're going to
[2:07:09] kind of read along here
[2:07:16] Hebrews 9 verse 1 then verily the first
[2:07:19] Covenant had also ordinances of divine
[2:07:22] service in a worldly sanctuary
[2:07:25] for there was a tabernacle made the
[2:07:27] first wherein was the Candlestick the
[2:07:30] table the showbridge which is called The
[2:07:32] Sanctuary after the second Veil The
[2:07:34] Tabernacle which is called the holy
[2:07:36] holiest of all
[2:07:38] which had the golden sensor in the Ark
[2:07:41] of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with
[2:07:43] gold wherein was the golden pod that had
[2:07:45] Manna and Aaron's Rod that butted in the
[2:07:48] tables of the Covenant
[2:07:49] and over at cherubims of Glory shadowing
[2:07:52] the mercy seats which we cannot now
[2:07:54] speak particularly
[2:07:56] now when these sayings were thus
[2:07:58] ordained the priest went always into the
[2:08:00] first Tabernacle accomplishing the
[2:08:03] service of God
[2:08:04] but into the second went the high priest
[2:08:07] alone once every year without blood
[2:08:11] not without blood
[2:08:14] which he offered for himself and for The
[2:08:17] Heirs of the people
[2:08:19] once a year
[2:08:21] the only one that went behind
[2:08:25] the last veil was the high priest and he
[2:08:28] had to be Anointed with blood how many
[2:08:30] knows that blood
[2:08:32] he's Anointed with oil
[2:08:34] the anointed and the oil went down off
[2:08:36] his head down his beard onto His Garment
[2:08:39] so he was annoying it had to have blood
[2:08:43] and his walk had to be holy before God
[2:08:45] and he had pomegranates and bills
[2:08:48] he had a rope tied to him
[2:08:51] and he walked holy holy holy unto the
[2:08:55] Lord holy holy unto the Lord right
[2:09:00] and if they quit hearing a noise
[2:09:03] or the bills
[2:09:05] right
[2:09:06] he's dead
[2:09:09] that's why listen saints of God you
[2:09:11] don't
[2:09:13] you don't try to go behind the veil
[2:09:15] unless you're anointed and got blood
[2:09:19] see when I see the blood
[2:09:21] I will pass over you
[2:09:23] when I see the blood when I see the
[2:09:25] token when I see the life manifested
[2:09:28] inside him he said today it's no longer
[2:09:31] that vial of blood you could have the
[2:09:34] very blood of Jesus Christ right now he
[2:09:37] said it would do you no good because
[2:09:39] it's transferred to something else he
[2:09:41] said it's the life
[2:09:43] that was in the blood
[2:09:45] when I see the blood I'll pass over okay
[2:09:48] let's keep reading
[2:09:50] into the second verse 7 when the high
[2:09:52] priest alone once every year not without
[2:09:55] blood which he offered for himself and
[2:09:58] for The Heirs of the people the Holy
[2:10:00] Ghost this signifying
[2:10:02] that the way into the holiest of all was
[2:10:04] not yet made manifest
[2:10:06] well as the first Tabernacle was yet
[2:10:09] standing
[2:10:10] which was a figure for the time then
[2:10:12] present in which we offered both gifts
[2:10:15] and sacrifices that could not make him
[2:10:18] which that did the service perfect as
[2:10:21] pertaining to the conscience so in other
[2:10:24] words it was a typing Shadow and it was
[2:10:26] blood but it was blood of bulls and
[2:10:28] goats
[2:10:30] which covered sin and didn't do away
[2:10:32] with it
[2:10:33] which stood only in me strengths divers
[2:10:37] Washington's carnal ordinances impose on
[2:10:39] them until the time of reformation but
[2:10:43] Christ becoming in high Priests of good
[2:10:45] things to come by a greater and more
[2:10:47] perfect Tabernacle
[2:10:49] we're talking about perfection
[2:10:52] here is a Greater Tabernacle not made
[2:10:55] with hands that is to say not of this
[2:10:57] building neither by the blood of of
[2:10:59] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[2:11:02] entered once into the holy Place having
[2:11:04] obtained
[2:11:06] Eternal Redemption for us
[2:11:10] somebody say us look put yourself in
[2:11:12] there
[2:11:14] redeem now I love to Proclaim it
[2:11:18] Is Us
[2:11:21] quit making it them
[2:11:23] someone else no take the word of God and
[2:11:26] make yourself a part of it
[2:11:30] identify with it
[2:11:34] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[2:11:36] and Ashes them and ever sprinkling
[2:11:38] the unclean Sanctified to the purifying
[2:11:41] of the flesh how much more shall the
[2:11:44] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[2:11:46] spirit offered himself without spot to
[2:11:49] God purging your conscience from dead
[2:11:52] Works to serve the Living God
[2:11:55] for this cause he the mediator of the
[2:11:57] New Testament that by means of death for
[2:12:00] the Redemption of the transgressions
[2:12:02] that were under the first testament they
[2:12:05] which are called might receive the
[2:12:07] promises of in Eternal inheritance
[2:12:13] Verse 18 whereupon neither the first
[2:12:15] testament was dedicated without blood
[2:12:18] for when Moses had spoken every precept
[2:12:21] to all the people according to the law
[2:12:23] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[2:12:26] with water and Scarlet wool and hiss
[2:12:28] have been sprinkled both the book and
[2:12:30] all the people this is the blood of the
[2:12:33] testament which God hath enjoined to you
[2:12:35] moreover he sprinkled the blood both the
[2:12:37] Tabernacle and all the vessels of the
[2:12:40] ministry and almost all things by the
[2:12:42] Lord perch with blood without the
[2:12:44] shedding of blood is no remission
[2:12:48] is therefore necessary that the patterns
[2:12:50] the patterns of things in heaven should
[2:12:52] be purified with these but the Heavenly
[2:12:54] things themselves with better sacrifices
[2:12:57] than these for Christ has not entered
[2:13:00] into the holy places made with hands
[2:13:03] which are figures of the true but into
[2:13:06] heaven itself
[2:13:07] now to appear in the presence of God for
[2:13:10] us
[2:13:11] nor yet
[2:13:13] that he should offer himself often as
[2:13:16] the high priest entered into the holy
[2:13:17] place every year with the blood of
[2:13:20] others for then he must often have
[2:13:22] suffered since the foundation of the
[2:13:23] world but now once in the end of the
[2:13:26] world hath he appeared to put away the
[2:13:29] sin by the sacrifice of him so
[2:13:36] here's Jehovah Jireh
[2:13:39] and as it is appointed and a man wants
[2:13:42] to die but after this the judgment and
[2:13:44] so Christ also appeared to Bear the sins
[2:13:46] of many
[2:13:47] and under them that look for him shall
[2:13:51] he appear the second time without sin
[2:13:53] unto salvation
[2:13:55] now
[2:13:57] I'm going to bring this to a close here
[2:13:59] if I can give me a couple minutes
[2:14:01] brother brennam in 1955 talks about
[2:14:04] perfection to the believer he titles the
[2:14:08] name of the sermon the position of a
[2:14:12] believer in Christ
[2:14:14] the subject is perfection
[2:14:17] now how can a mortal man ever become
[2:14:20] perfected
[2:14:21] and yet God said in his word that he
[2:14:23] chose us to be holy perfected before the
[2:14:26] foundation of the world how are you
[2:14:28] going to do that
[2:14:30] and Jesus said be therefore perfect as
[2:14:32] your father in Heaven is perfect is that
[2:14:34] right now if God before the world
[2:14:37] ordained it we should be holy Without
[2:14:38] Blame and perfect in the sight of God
[2:14:40] and we struggling and murmuring and
[2:14:44] don't you think God's seen all these
[2:14:45] things
[2:14:47] he foreknew it and predestinated
[2:14:50] ordained us to be so elected us before
[2:14:52] the world was ever formed now here's how
[2:14:55] he did it in the ninth chapter 21st
[2:14:57] verse
[2:14:58] Christ being a high priest of good
[2:15:00] things to come by a greater and more
[2:15:02] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[2:15:05] that is to say not made of this building
[2:15:07] neither by the blood of gods but by his
[2:15:10] own blood he has entered into once into
[2:15:12] the holy Place Heaven having obtained
[2:15:16] Eternal Redemption for us
[2:15:19] in a now he preaches 1957 he's he's on a
[2:15:23] roll now he's talking about perfection
[2:15:24] he's talking about a believer's position
[2:15:27] in Christ
[2:15:29] he titles the sermon the perfection
[2:15:33] oh what is it oh God requires perfection
[2:15:38] he requires your repentance he requires
[2:15:40] your loyalty to him
[2:15:43] he's looking tonight no matter how much
[2:15:45] you've sinned how little or how much
[2:15:47] you're still a sinner and you cannot get
[2:15:50] in no other way but by Jesus Christ
[2:15:52] God's all-sufficient sacrifice
[2:15:55] in him you are perfected forever
[2:15:59] think of it
[2:16:01] it's not
[2:16:02] nothing you do
[2:16:05] it's not new pages you turn
[2:16:08] it's not a new life you start
[2:16:11] it's a confession of your wrong
[2:16:15] and God's grace to you
[2:16:17] that brings you to perfection
[2:16:20] then you are perfected
[2:16:23] in Jesus Christ
[2:16:32] how can we have perfect faith
[2:16:35] for a perfect rapture unless there is a
[2:16:38] perfect message
[2:16:40] to catch away A Perfect Bride
[2:16:43] let me tell you that's why God
[2:16:45] circumcised this message
[2:16:47] to take away all the flesh to bring
[2:16:50] forth a perfect word
[2:16:53] that's why the opening of the seals
[2:16:55] because those seals is Christ
[2:16:57] he is those seals
[2:17:00] he is the one what is God doing he's
[2:17:02] bringing for the life that was in him
[2:17:05] into the life of every believer
[2:17:15] when you come to church you're coming
[2:17:17] here that God might perfect your walk
[2:17:20] you might learn something
[2:17:26] it's not done by the first and second
[2:17:28] pull
[2:17:31] but the third pull the revealing of the
[2:17:33] word Luke chapter 13.
[2:17:35] verses 31 and 32 the same day there came
[2:17:39] certain of the Pharisees singing to him
[2:17:41] get thee out and depart thanks for Herod
[2:17:43] will kill thee
[2:17:45] and he said unto them go ye and tell
[2:17:47] that fox
[2:17:48] behold I cast out devils and I do cures
[2:17:52] today and tomorrow
[2:17:54] and the third day
[2:17:57] I shall be perfected the third day third
[2:18:00] pull
[2:18:01] revealing the word
[2:18:03] are you catching it
[2:18:05] you see the third day when I changed my
[2:18:08] Ministry
[2:18:09] go tell that old Fox
[2:18:11] yeah I'm I
[2:18:14] just don't tell nobody
[2:18:17] because if you tell them what's going
[2:18:18] I'm trying to teach
[2:18:21] Pentecostal preachers Supernatural
[2:18:24] things
[2:18:25] and what they are is a bunch of babies
[2:18:28] I'm appalling I'm of Apollos and Paul
[2:18:31] got so sigmas I'm glad I never even
[2:18:33] baptized you unless you say I baptize
[2:18:35] you in my own name brother Brandon was
[2:18:37] so tired of first and second pull
[2:18:41] until finally hey what good is it done
[2:18:43] tell them their name where they're from
[2:18:45] as far as I'm concerned I'm going up in
[2:18:46] the hills grow my hair along I'll become
[2:18:48] a Trapper
[2:18:49] forget it and then when God he did all
[2:18:51] he's got to do is tell me go down I'll
[2:18:53] give him thus saith the Lord go right
[2:18:54] back up there
[2:18:58] I think every Pastor goes through times
[2:19:00] like that
[2:19:02] tell you what what good all this
[2:19:04] preaching every Sunday and every
[2:19:06] Wednesday night and everything
[2:19:08] people don't take it so serious I just
[2:19:11] gonna go up in the mountains
[2:19:14] let me tell you
[2:19:16] you can't get away from God
[2:19:20] Paul said
[2:19:22] woven to me if I preach not the gospel
[2:19:25] lest I myself
[2:19:28] become a Castaway
[2:19:32] so the third poll is a Perfection
[2:19:35] Ministry I want to show it to you
[2:19:37] a Perfection Ministry that's why the
[2:19:41] devil is hitting the ministry
[2:19:44] because will the bride of Christ have a
[2:19:48] Ministry before the coming of the Lord
[2:19:50] yeah sure uh-huh that's right it'll be
[2:19:53] ever so simple it'll be Apostles
[2:19:55] prophets evangelists past teachers for
[2:19:58] the perfecting
[2:20:01] of the Saints till we come to the unity
[2:20:05] of the faith faith is a revelation
[2:20:09] right faith is an appearing
[2:20:13] and I'll tell you one way for us to quit
[2:20:15] all of our arguing about what this meant
[2:20:17] and what that meant and this quote and
[2:20:19] that quote just say what he said
[2:20:24] well he said yeah well he also said
[2:20:28] well quit arguing over it the only time
[2:20:31] we have real disagreements well this is
[2:20:33] what he meant by it that's not what he
[2:20:36] meant by he meant by this pretty soon
[2:20:38] your fight who cares
[2:20:41] Brethren said one said he's coming on a
[2:20:43] white horse and another says he's coming
[2:20:45] on a white cloud who cares as long as we
[2:20:49] agree he's coming
[2:20:51] stop all of this nonsense
[2:20:54] everybody don't have to see it the way I
[2:20:56] see it
[2:20:58] you don't have to eat the same kind of
[2:21:00] food I eat
[2:21:01] some of you don't like hot stuff
[2:21:05] no I love it hot I like someone I bought
[2:21:08] it it bites me back
[2:21:10] some of you you live in a hospital food
[2:21:13] Bland no salt no pepper no nothing
[2:21:17] I like someone I bite into it yeah yeah
[2:21:22] I had a jalapeno the other day
[2:21:25] Michael we were up
[2:21:28] we were up there quill hunting you
[2:21:29] remember that just up near Baghdad
[2:21:32] and jalapenos jalapenos are not really
[2:21:34] that hot
[2:21:35] now habanero and ghost pepper and all
[2:21:38] that stuff they get hot
[2:21:39] jalapeno it's more like a bell pepper to
[2:21:42] me
[2:21:42] he gave me a jalapeno and he grilled it
[2:21:45] on the grill
[2:21:46] now it was physically hot the skin was
[2:21:49] shriveled up on it brother Ron man I
[2:21:51] cooked you a jalapeno a man good
[2:21:54] I started eating it like a pickle
[2:22:02] Fire coming out of my mouth smoke coming
[2:22:05] out of my ear
[2:22:06] I couldn't talk for a couple minutes
[2:22:09] Michael goes
[2:22:10] are you okay
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:15] that thing turned me Every Way but Loose
[2:22:21] hot
[2:22:22] I never thought jalapenos were so now I
[2:22:26] I take the first bite and I see how hot
[2:22:29] is that jalapeno because some jalapenos
[2:22:33] can't be
[2:22:35] hot
[2:22:37] and I like hot food
[2:22:39] how many of you like hot food yeah good
[2:22:42] come on over I I got peppers for all of
[2:22:45] you and the rest of you yeah you'll just
[2:22:47] have to have bologna and cheese and
[2:22:51] real peanut butter and jelly we'll keep
[2:22:53] it simple for you
[2:22:55] anyway
[2:23:01] God is bringing his church now I'm going
[2:23:04] to take this in the next service
[2:23:06] to another level
[2:23:09] show you that the ministry now here's
[2:23:12] what I started to see
[2:23:14] the reason the devil is attacking the
[2:23:17] ministry is because brother Branham said
[2:23:19] this ministry of Ephesians 4 is what is
[2:23:24] going to be doing to perfecting the
[2:23:27] bride but he said it's not the minister
[2:23:29] no man takes this Glory yeah you can't
[2:23:32] make it without me
[2:23:34] oh you stuff shirt
[2:23:37] no let me tell you if God ever used a
[2:23:40] minister it's because that minister
[2:23:42] yielded himself and God used him
[2:23:46] okay and God used him so we don't take
[2:23:49] this well you can't make no no Hey
[2:23:51] listen all I am is a servant and if I
[2:23:55] will get myself out of the way and I
[2:23:58] will give to you what he has given to me
[2:24:00] then it's not me giving it to you it's
[2:24:03] him giving it to you all he did was come
[2:24:06] and annoyed me while I'm in my study and
[2:24:08] I'm praying and I'm seeking God but it
[2:24:11] was all of you that your prayers last
[2:24:14] night the night before what you were
[2:24:15] going through and some of you actually
[2:24:18] turned me while I'm preaching
[2:24:21] that
[2:24:24] that no actually I like it
[2:24:27] brother Ron the reason the reason you
[2:24:29] did what you did was because I turned
[2:24:33] you
[2:24:33] yeah I knew it was you I could look at
[2:24:35] you I could see you're going yes give it
[2:24:38] to me
[2:24:39] and you take me away from my notes take
[2:24:42] me away from everything I studied and
[2:24:44] you give me pull me way out here because
[2:24:46] you want a fresh word
[2:24:49] Hallelujah that's what the ministry is
[2:24:51] to do is to bring the fresh revealed
[2:24:55] word the carcass of the hour not what I
[2:24:58] know it ain't what I know it's what I
[2:25:00] don't know it's called the Revelation
[2:25:03] that comes
[2:25:04] from God himself
[2:25:08] blessed art thou Simon barjona for fresh
[2:25:12] and blood didn't reveal this year but my
[2:25:14] Father which is in heaven when you get
[2:25:16] Revelation you're not getting enough
[2:25:18] from your pastor you're not getting it
[2:25:20] from the prophet you're getting it from
[2:25:22] God himself it's a father making himself
[2:25:26] known to you the father
[2:25:29] what's it all about Jesus did not come
[2:25:32] to reveal himself he said I can do
[2:25:35] nothing
[2:25:41] until the father
[2:25:43] reveals it to me
[2:25:46] did you know the Bible says
[2:25:49] Jesus speaking he said all things
[2:25:51] concerning me have an end
[2:25:54] I want to ask you when we go to heaven
[2:25:57] and we get up there
[2:25:59] are you going to see Jesus Christ over
[2:26:01] here and the father sitting on a throne
[2:26:09] show us the father
[2:26:11] have I been so long with you
[2:26:13] have I preached so many sermons I tell
[2:26:16] you if you've seen me
[2:26:21] you've seen the father because I and the
[2:26:24] father are one when we get over there
[2:26:27] let me tell you this Revelation that
[2:26:30] started in Christ the mystery of God so
[2:26:34] started
[2:26:37] he was a beginning
[2:26:39] of the creation of God
[2:26:42] and now
[2:26:43] he came down so that we could see him
[2:26:46] touch him we could feel him we could
[2:26:48] understand
[2:26:49] because he says Jehovah God is too
[2:26:53] mysterious him through millions and
[2:26:56] trillions of light years he could not
[2:26:58] reveal himself
[2:27:01] because he's too great
[2:27:03] your little finite mind would lock up
[2:27:07] like an old computer a 286 if you tried
[2:27:12] to put a 286 with an upgrade right now
[2:27:20] your little finite mind so what God does
[2:27:22] to you every time you come to church you
[2:27:25] sit down and you're under
[2:27:27] huh you're under the cloud catch this
[2:27:30] when you're under the cloud you begin to
[2:27:32] get upgrades it happens your cell phone
[2:27:36] doesn't hey your cell phone your
[2:27:38] computer guess what you just been
[2:27:40] upgraded you just saved you know it
[2:27:42] turned itself off and went to like this
[2:27:44] and ah I don't know about you but that
[2:27:47] that stuff it
[2:27:49] my computer it's off why'd it go off
[2:27:53] I press it oh you just been upgraded hmm
[2:27:59] all of the little faults and the little
[2:28:01] things and you get more emojis and you
[2:28:04] get on
[2:28:05] I didn't ask for emojis
[2:28:09] I didn't ask for all this I know you
[2:28:11] came to church though
[2:28:13] and you sat down
[2:28:15] and while the word is being preached
[2:28:17] under the influence
[2:28:19] because we have been encompassed by such
[2:28:22] a great
[2:28:23] cloud of witness guess what
[2:28:26] there's clouds of witnesses all
[2:28:28] throughout and guess what while you're
[2:28:30] sitting there all of a sudden
[2:28:34] get an upgrade God's changing you
[2:28:38] from Glory unto Glory from the glory of
[2:28:40] this terrestrial to the glory of the
[2:28:43] celestial
[2:28:45] Hallelujah and when you catch a
[2:28:47] revelation guess what all of a sudden
[2:28:49] you are jettisoned
[2:28:51] from this realm
[2:28:56] wow
[2:28:58] wow Lord
[2:29:00] that was so great
[2:29:04] but the problem is as we come back down
[2:29:06] don't we
[2:29:09] but one day musicians come come
[2:29:13] one day it won't happen that way
[2:29:19] take another step
[2:29:22] into that theophany
[2:29:26] take another step
[2:29:29] it's eternity calling you
[2:29:36] this message is so so Supernatural
[2:29:43] that it keeps unveiling itself the same
[2:29:46] as the Holy Scripture
[2:29:49] because you can read a spoken word book
[2:29:52] the same as you read a Bible
[2:29:54] and you can read the words on that page
[2:29:57] and it gives you so much according to
[2:30:00] your understanding because you're a babe
[2:30:02] in Christ but later you read it now as a
[2:30:05] full blown adult with mature thinking
[2:30:09] and you exercise
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:12] your senses to start discerning
[2:30:16] now and then all of a sudden it reveal
[2:30:19] and you go wow why didn't I ever see
[2:30:23] that before
[2:30:25] huh
[2:30:26] it's because it's in season
[2:30:29] and there's a time and season for all
[2:30:31] things and each one of you
[2:30:33] have a certain time and season in your
[2:30:36] life and you as a little child you
[2:30:37] couldn't get it because you don't teach
[2:30:39] little children
[2:30:41] trigonometry you teach them basic math
[2:30:45] huh
[2:30:47] teach them basic math
[2:30:49] for when I was a child I thought as a
[2:30:52] child I understood as a child
[2:30:55] but when I became a man
[2:30:58] I put away childish things
[2:31:03] the bride is coming into a Ministry now
[2:31:05] of perfection
[2:31:09] because as his ministry changed Soma
[2:31:12] Stars
[2:31:14] that's the reason
[2:31:16] that there is so much that well hey you
[2:31:19] don't need to go to church anymore
[2:31:21] nah hey
[2:31:25] not just stay home press play
[2:31:29] is that the Bible
[2:31:33] brother Ryan said God never ordained
[2:31:35] mechanical devices
[2:31:38] to preach the gospel he said he used the
[2:31:40] element of man
[2:31:45] so people
[2:31:47] they don't go to church anymore
[2:31:48] are you still stay home
[2:31:51] I just press play
[2:31:53] no reverence
[2:31:55] I'll tell you the first ones he will
[2:31:56] sacrifice when you do that
[2:31:59] stay away from fellowship stay away from
[2:32:02] a five-fold Ministry stay away from the
[2:32:05] things that God has ordained for the and
[2:32:07] the first thing you will sacrifice are
[2:32:08] your children
[2:32:10] your children to say
[2:32:14] are you kidding me
[2:32:16] stay home and just press play and then
[2:32:18] have somebody tell you that when we get
[2:32:20] into the Eternal heavens
[2:32:22] when we get over there you're still
[2:32:24] going to press play
[2:32:26] are you kidding me
[2:32:29] such foolishness such Fables
[2:32:34] let me tell you that but I will tell you
[2:32:36] this this revelation

[2:33:21] be so worth the word until the whole
[2:33:22] thing will work right up to the coming
[2:33:24] of the Lord I believe that I believe
[2:33:26] we're nearing that time now
[2:33:29] he's making us aware of it
[2:33:35] in the sermon perseverance

[2:34:36] Jesus Christ I didn't know I didn't know
[2:34:39] all these things I didn't know the
[2:34:40] hidden mysteries of the word of God
[2:34:43] until a prophet came and gave to us what
[2:34:47] do prophets do they reveal the word
[2:34:50] they don't add to it they reveal what is
[2:34:53] already written
[2:34:56] brother random that could be the 23rd
[2:34:59] chapter of the Book of Revelation oh no
[2:35:02] that would be adding to or taking away
[2:35:05] but what I believe my Ministry is is
[2:35:08] revealing what's already been written

[2:39:46] perfect
[2:39:48] when we're in Christ
