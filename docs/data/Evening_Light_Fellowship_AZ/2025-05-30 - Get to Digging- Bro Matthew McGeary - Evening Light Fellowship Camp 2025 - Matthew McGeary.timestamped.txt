[0:01] Are you you know I've sat where you've
[0:03] sat before. You really don't want to
[0:05] hear what the preacher has to say and
[0:07] you're just going to try to get through
[0:08] the service because there's other things
[0:09] you want to do. But but if you want to
[0:11] miss the tribulation, the prophet of God
[0:13] said you better start digging.
[0:16] So I don't know about you, but if the
[0:17] prophet said, "I'm preaching to myself."
[0:19] Come on now. If the if a vindicated
[0:21] prophet was preaching the message and he
[0:24] said, "You know what? I'm preaching to
[0:26] myself. I better I'm going to dig deeper
[0:28] than I've ever dug before." I say each
[0:30] one of us, something in your heart and
[0:32] in your soul ought to be saying, "I'm
[0:34] going to start digging deeper than I've
[0:36] ever dug in all of my life."
[0:41] But are you willing to make an effort?
[0:45] Are you willing to put your shoulder to
[0:46] the wheel?
[0:49] You know, it reminds me of that story
[0:51] one time about the lepers. You know,
[0:53] they were sitting out there and and and
[0:56] you know, they knew that, man, if if if
[0:58] if we go back into into Israel, we're
[1:01] going to die. If we go down uh uh to the
[1:03] enemy's camp, we're going to die. But
[1:05] they, you know, they said,
[1:06] pre-adventure, maybe maybe we find
[1:08] something that can help us. They and
[1:09] they said, "Why sit here till we die?"
[1:12] And what did they do? They they they
[1:13] they they made an effort. And you know,
[1:16] maybe you that study your Bible, you
[1:18] understand what happened. They went in
[1:20] and they they found riches and realized
[1:22] they couldn't get them all for
[1:23] themselves and they they went and told
[1:25] uh uh the Israel and prophecy was
[1:27] fulfilled. But but in this little
[1:29] message that we're trying to work
[1:30] through, making the valley full of
[1:31] ditches, uh brother Brandham talks about
[1:34] getting into the spirit and getting into
[1:35] the spirit of revival and and having to
[1:38] make an effort and and and getting into
[1:40] work to do our part.
[1:42] It takes each one of us to do our part.
[1:44] That's why we have a little song
[1:45] service. It's it's not just a a a
[1:48] routine and religion and ritual. Come on
[1:50] now. That there's a purpose in us coming
[1:52] together and and singing the songs. Uh
[1:55] we we saw the pattern right there.
[1:57] That's why the prophet, he got all
[1:58] worked up because because this
[2:00] backsliden Israelite borderline believer
[2:02] had come down inquiring them of the
[2:04] Lord. He said, "Look, man, if if this
[2:05] righteous Jehoshaphat wasn't here, I
[2:07] wouldn't even be talking to you." He got
[2:08] all worked up. A vindicated prophet got
[2:10] all worked up. And what he say, "Hey,
[2:12] bring me a minstal. I need to calm down
[2:13] a little bit.
[2:15] There ain't way I'm going to be able to
[2:16] seek God. There ain't no way I'm going
[2:18] to be able to get anything from a
[2:20] preacher. There ain't no way I got my
[2:22] mind right. I got my mind on everything
[2:24] else. So, let's just sing a few psalms.
[2:26] Let's start getting into an atmosphere.
[2:28] Let's start getting our hearts. Let's
[2:30] start looking for what God's going to
[2:31] do. I don't know about you. Do you want
[2:33] that in camp?
[2:38] I'm already I feel some push back. Some
[2:41] people don't want it.
[2:44] They didn't come here for that. Hey, you
[2:46] know, it's amazing. It's It's amazing
[2:48] how those things just pop off. You can't
[2:50] hide it. Oh, it's awesome. I tell you
[2:52] what, Jesus Christ is the same
[2:54] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[2:56] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:57] the heart. You can be sitting there and
[2:59] as the word is going forth, oh, it's
[3:01] discerning. And believe it or not, it
[3:03] can show all over you and you not even
[3:05] think it. You think you're hiding it,
[3:07] but oh, there's a spiritual realm taking
[3:09] place. Oh, yeah. There's demons trying
[3:11] to distract you and seow seeds into your
[3:13] mind. Oh, but I wonder if you'll just
[3:15] wake up for a minute and realize that
[3:17] you're in a spiritual warfare and say,
[3:19] "I don't want to pay attention to those
[3:21] negative thoughts coming into my mind."
[3:23] And start to realize that the devil's
[3:24] trying to keep you from missing
[3:26] something.
[3:27] [Applause]
[3:31] We want to do our part.
[3:34] And just as we were speaking about this,
[3:36] you know, uh uh Jehooram was was the son
[3:39] of Ahab. And when when Ahab, you know,
[3:42] the wicked Ahab and Jezebel when he had
[3:44] died, he uh Ahab had uh Moab under his
[3:47] rule and and they were paying taxes and
[3:49] and Ahab died and his son Jerome, he he
[3:52] took over and Moab rebelled and and they
[3:54] didn't, you know, they didn't want to
[3:56] pay taxes anymore. And brother Random
[3:58] talks about how he he wasn't as bad as
[4:00] his as his daddy because he put away
[4:01] some from some of the idols and stuff,
[4:03] but he he didn't go all the way with
[4:06] God. He was just a a borderline
[4:10] believer. Prophet of God would say it
[4:12] like this in that sermon, making the
[4:14] valley full of ditches. He So then we
[4:16] find out that when Jerome had ascended
[4:19] to the throne, he was a borderline
[4:21] believer, just a halfway lukewarm
[4:24] believer. So many of them in the world
[4:26] tonight, Jerome would just set his sail
[4:29] and anyway the wind was blowing, that's
[4:31] the way Jerome would go. I say we still
[4:34] got the same problem tonight. Lukewarm
[4:37] believers, come on. Just go with the
[4:39] flow. If their friends do something,
[4:41] they just do it, too. Come
[4:44] on. It's a plague in our young people.
[4:47] Some young person got Tik Tok going on
[4:49] their phone and some of us ain't even
[4:51] got a backbone to say, you know what, I
[4:52] don't believe in watching that. We kind
[4:54] of just we're just kind of borderline
[4:56] believers. If if they're listening to
[4:57] contemporary Christian, we just go with
[5:00] the flow. If it kind of blends into more
[5:02] worldly music, we just go with the flow.
[5:04] If they're watching this video and that
[5:06] video, oh, we just go with the flow. If
[5:08] we go over and stay at our friend's
[5:09] house and we thought they had a standard
[5:11] like we had back in our own home and
[5:12] they got some TV or some instrument in
[5:15] their room and they're able to watch
[5:16] Netflix or some movie or they're getting
[5:18] on their phone and you just kind of
[5:19] well, you know, I don't want to say
[5:21] anything. I'm just going to go with the
[5:22] flow. You better watch out. You might be
[5:24] a borderline
[5:26] believer. Hey, we I'm I'm preaching to
[5:28] you. I know where you're living at. But
[5:30] God's calling you to be more than a
[5:32] borderline believer.
[5:37] He wants you to stand up and have a
[5:38] backbone
[5:40] and tell your sister, tell your brother,
[5:42] say, "Hey buddy, you know, I I
[5:44] understand that would be fine and that
[5:45] would be fun and that, you know, it
[5:47] seemed like that'd be a good old time,
[5:48] but I just, you know, there's something
[5:50] in my heart. I don't feel that's all
[5:51] right. Would it be okay if we did
[5:52] something else?
[5:55] Come on. I know where you're living at.
[5:59] And we've been plagued by cell phones
[6:00] and devices and Tik Toks and videos. And
[6:04] you wonder why we don't have the power
[6:05] of God and the spirit of God moving in
[6:07] our lives and moving through our worship
[6:09] and the songs we see. It's because we
[6:11] become a borderline
[6:13] believer. Oh, I say it behooves us to
[6:15] repent.
[6:17] Let's get back to a good oldfashioned
[6:19] Holy Ghost message
[6:21] gospel where the Holy Ghost is in our
[6:24] home. The Holy Ghost is in our room. The
[6:26] Holy Ghost is in our car. The Holy Ghost
[6:28] is governing our phone.
[6:34] Oh, I want to go all the way with God.
[6:39] I don't want to be a borderline
[6:40] believer. Amen.
[6:43] You know that brother Random tells a
[6:44] story about that one
[6:50] kid. His mama was sending him up to camp
[6:53] and you know he
[6:56] uh he told his mama told him son when
[6:58] they find out you're a Christian you
[7:00] know they're going to really give you a
[7:02] hard time. He's like okay all right well
[7:05] you know. So his mama took him up there
[7:07] and and he was up there maybe for four
[7:09] or five days and you know that uh mama
[7:13] was praying for a little boy and she
[7:15] come back and picked him up and said,
[7:16] "How did camp go?" And he goes, "Oh,
[7:18] mama. Camp went great." Really? Camp
[7:21] went great. Like yeah, yeah. Well, well,
[7:24] well, what what happened? He goes, "Oh,
[7:26] Obama, they never found out I was a
[7:27] Christian."
[7:31] Yeah. What about you?
[7:35] What about your schoolmates, your
[7:36] classmates, your your co-workers?
[7:40] You're the only God that they might ever
[7:42] see. You might you might be the only
[7:45] represent representative of eternal life
[7:48] that they might not ever see. And I
[7:50] wonder if on that day some of them would
[7:51] say, "Why didn't you just tell
[7:53] me? Why didn't you tell me?" No, they
[7:56] might not be elect, but I tell you, we
[7:58] have some goods that can set people
[8:00] free. I I don't know what'll happen at
[8:02] white throne judgment, but I say this
[8:04] message has power. The Bible has power.
[8:06] We have a word that has power. And I say
[8:09] we have an opportunity or I should say a
[8:12] responsibility to let the people we know
[8:15] about the message.
[8:17] Wouldn't that be a shame?
[8:20] go to a school with so many people and
[8:22] you sat next to somebody or a co-orker
[8:25] and they they work you worked beside
[8:27] them for 10 years and you asked them
[8:30] said, "Hey, what does so and so
[8:31] believe?" Like, "I don't know. What do
[8:33] you mean you don't know?" "Well, I don't
[8:34] know. I know they they kind of dress
[8:36] different and talk a little bit
[8:37] different, but I think they're
[8:39] Christians." Oh my. I say, "God, help
[8:41] me. I don't want to be a borderline
[8:42] believer, Lord. I want to be be able to
[8:45] proclaim this message in boldness." What
[8:48] happened to the disciples uh when they
[8:50] got gathered in that upper room?
[8:53] Are you hearing me? Okay.
[8:56] Yeah. What happened to them? The Holy
[8:58] Spirit came and and they were what? Hh
[9:01] tired uh weary and scared and quivering
[9:05] and didn't want to tell nobody about the
[9:07] message. Didn't want to tell them that
[9:09] Jesus Christ had had raised from the
[9:11] grave because oh my, if they killed him,
[9:13] they'll kill him. What are we going to
[9:14] do? Right? But then when the Holy Ghost
[9:16] come, they come jumping out the windows,
[9:18] pounding out the doors and they started
[9:20] to proclaim the message of the hour and
[9:22] it caught a lot of people's attention
[9:24] and they wanted to see what all the
[9:25] commotion was about. I wonder if Christ
[9:28] is making a commotion in your life. So
[9:30] much so that your neighbors want to
[9:32] know, your friends want to know, your
[9:34] family want to know, you when you come
[9:35] back, your church members, they'll look
[9:37] and say, "I know something happened to
[9:45] ever. But we got the same problem
[9:47] tonight. Lukewarm believers, borderline
[9:50] believers. I say what we need is a real
[9:52] born again filled with the Holy Ghost
[9:55] experience where God could give us a
[9:57] backbone to stand up to some of this
[9:59] nonsense.
[10:03] Hey, I what God did for me, he didn't
[10:07] change. What God did for brother Ron, he
[10:09] didn't change. just not a different
[10:11] experience that it was in the 60s that
[10:13] it is. It's the same God. It's the same
[10:15] Holy Ghost. It's the same word. And he's
[10:18] the same yesterday, today, and
[10:22] forever. Some of us just know enough
[10:25] about the message to dress
[10:28] right or pass an intellectual word
[10:32] test. What is the son of man? What is
[10:36] the seventh seal? and
[10:39] intellectually we can we can we can we
[10:42] can fit right in. But when it comes to a
[10:47] life when it comes to living an
[10:49] overcoming life and I ain't talking
[10:51] about up here on the mountaintop, what
[10:53] about when you get down in the valley?
[10:55] When you get all alone and you're in
[10:57] your private time and you're in your car
[10:59] and you're all alone in your room, what
[11:01] kind of fruits are you displaying
[11:04] there? Yes.
[11:07] Are you living an overcoming life
[11:09] there? I say, "God, I I just don't want
[11:12] to to have an intellectual conception of
[11:14] the message. I I I I understand. I I
[11:18] hear a lot of things, Lord, but but I
[11:20] hear something that's laying in the word
[11:22] that brings realities.
[11:25] Come on, help me preach. We might be
[11:27] here a long time." Amen. I might just
[11:30] slow way down. I got a few pages of
[11:32] notes. I can just slow it down a little
[11:33] bit. just say we need a real because I
[11:36] preach a little bit but my dad he
[11:38] preaches you know real slow and I preach
[11:41] really fast and some pe some gifts are
[11:43] different than others and so uh that's
[11:46] wonderful. Well, God has a beautiful
[11:47] bouquet of gifts and and so when I say
[11:50] me slowing it down is it'll take me a
[11:52] lot longer to get through my material so
[11:54] I can start talking slower,
[11:56] but I do want you to understand and get
[11:59] it that there is a real born again
[12:02] filled with the Holy Ghost experience
[12:04] that will change your thoughts, change
[12:06] your desires, change the way you look at
[12:08] things, change your ambitions, change
[12:10] the way that you do things.
[12:14] So, just moving here, if we can just
[12:16] continue on in our story here in Kings.
[12:19] Is everybody feeling okay? Is everybody
[12:22] tired?
[12:24] Well, praise the Lord. That's good cuz I
[12:28] know a lot of y'all are tired. It's
[12:30] first night you drove ways to get up
[12:32] here. Come on. Is that It's okay. Y'all
[12:34] tired.
[12:37] Say some of you tired.
[12:40] Well, see, we got a mixed audience of
[12:42] tiredness and some are ready and that's
[12:45] okay. But you know what? If you're
[12:46] tired, the prophet said if you hit
[12:48] something, just throw that thing out.
[12:50] Let's keep going. So, good. Everybody's
[12:52] feeling good. I like this. I like this.
[12:55] So, here we go. We're We're in our story
[12:57] here in Kings and Moab was paying the
[12:59] taxes under Israel rule, but now his son
[13:02] Jerome is on the throne. And Moab's
[13:04] rebelling and and Jerome is asking the
[13:07] king of Judah for help to go up in war
[13:09] against uh Moab and bring them back
[13:11] under their subjection. And the prophet
[13:12] would say this uh as we continue on in
[13:15] this message, he says, "And the first
[13:16] thing you know there was Moab rebelled
[13:18] against Israel. So then he called for
[13:20] help. Now the king of Judah was
[13:22] Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat was a
[13:24] righteous man. Now, I want you to notice
[13:26] how easy it is sometime on a little
[13:28] persuasion for a Christian to get in the
[13:30] wrong company trying to pity. Well, I
[13:33] tell you, I will just go down to the
[13:34] pool room or or I I won't play any pool,
[13:37] but I'll go down there. I I won't go to
[13:39] the dance with Susie. Well, I want to
[13:40] tell you, you know, uh nowadays, we live
[13:42] in a day of technology. So, it might not
[13:45] be so much of you going down to the pool
[13:47] room. It might not be so much of you
[13:49] going onto the wrong grounds physically,
[13:51] but I tell you, where are you going
[13:55] digitally? Oh, don't go there, Brother
[13:57] Matthew. That's my little safe place
[13:59] that nobody knows about. Don't start
[14:02] talking about websites and and social
[14:05] medias and and news platforms and and
[14:08] chats and talks and and things that I
[14:10] don't and my video game. Oh, don't hit
[14:12] that. I'm about to get some brothers
[14:13] really nervous. our video games and and
[14:16] first player killing people games and
[14:18] and all of these kind of things. Where
[14:19] do you think that stuff takes you? Away
[14:23] from
[14:27] God. Look, I've been there. I've been a
[14:30] young Christian. I've had to battle
[14:32] those things and and I've entertained
[14:33] those things. And I never got up one
[14:35] time from playing a a a video game and
[14:37] said, "Man, I feel like a better
[14:40] Christian. Woo. I'm just I'm just ready
[14:42] to go." You know that thing eats at you
[14:44] like a canker,
[14:46] causing you not to redeem the time.
[14:51] We get on the wrong ground. He says
[14:53] because she's a good girl and maybe
[14:54] maybe I'll win her to the Lord. You'll
[14:56] never do it doing it that. That's right.
[14:58] Show your colors. That's right. Don't
[15:00] get on them wrong ground. That's what
[15:02] the matter with the Pentecostal church
[15:03] tonight. They've got on the wrong
[15:04] ground. I say that's a the problem with
[15:06] a lot of us message believers tonight.
[15:08] We've got on the wrong ground.
[15:11] Well, I'm just saying what a prophet
[15:13] said. You know, it's okay to amen him,
[15:17] right? Look, I tell you one thing about
[15:19] brother Matthew. I don't I don't got a
[15:21] thought
[15:22] coming. You know how I know
[15:25] that? Does anybody know how I know that?
[15:29] Nobody knows how I don't have a thought?
[15:31] Because a prophet told me I don't have a
[15:32] thought coming. Brother Brandham said,
[15:34] "You don't have a thought coming."
[15:36] That's why I know I don't have a thought
[15:38] coming. It's because a vindicated
[15:40] prophet told me that. So then I'm not
[15:42] interested in what Matthew McGary
[15:44] thinks. I'm interested in what the
[15:46] message says.
[15:48] I'm interested in what the word of God
[15:50] says. So you can just relax. Brother
[15:53] Matthew is not going to preh preach some
[15:55] weird something that you've never heard.
[15:57] I know who your pastor is, and your
[15:59] pastor believes this message with all of
[16:02] his heart.
[16:04] Well, I thought I thought we'd get an
[16:06] amen out of that at least.
[16:08] You know, I might be a southerner or
[16:09] something. Just help me out a little
[16:11] bit. Let let me know you're still out
[16:13] there. You know, it's okay to say amen.
[16:15] It's okay to get excited because we were
[16:17] talking about getting in the spirit. And
[16:19] if we're going to get in the spirit of
[16:20] revival, the prophet is telling us we
[16:22] got to get in the spirit of revival. So,
[16:24] it's okay just to let off the heavy
[16:25] bands and and start to have a little
[16:27] feel good. You know, you got Hey, we're
[16:30] living for Jesus. There there's nothing
[16:32] greater than to live for Jesus. Well,
[16:34] we're going in a rapture. We're going in
[16:36] a body change. I tell you, I that's more
[16:39] more way more exciting than than the NBA
[16:41] finals.
[16:45] It's way more exciting than who won the
[16:47] NBA draft or or who's hockey. This is
[16:50] that and and what your favorite sports
[16:52] program. That's all going to perish.
[16:53] It's all going to die. It's all going to
[16:56] burn up. And then who you going to be
[16:57] rooting
[16:58] for? Come on. But we we got a
[17:01] message. We we we got Christ living in
[17:04] our midst. I say let don't let them come
[17:06] here with dirty feet. Wash them.
[17:10] Entertain them. Say amen to the word.
[17:15] And if you don't want to be here, just
[17:17] act like you want to be here. It'll make
[17:18] me feel a little better.
[17:23] He says that's what's the matter with
[17:24] the Pentecostal church. They've got on
[17:26] the wrong grounds. That's the reason
[17:28] that the churches tonight, it used it be
[17:31] wrong for people to do certain things.
[17:33] Oh, we could stay here a while now. It's
[17:36] not wrong. They do it anyhow. You go on
[17:39] the wrong grounds with the wrong crowd.
[17:42] Yeah. It used to be wrong for us to
[17:46] listen to contemporary Christian. It
[17:48] used to be wrong for us to listen to
[17:50] some of this rock and roll stuff that
[17:52] they've just mixed in Christian lyrics.
[17:55] That doesn't make it not rock and roll.
[17:57] It's rock and roll.
[17:59] It used to be wrong for for a believing
[18:01] sister to wear a tight shirt and to wear
[18:03] a short dress and to wear a slit that's
[18:05] so high. Oh, I I tell you, it used to be
[18:08] wrong. And I want to tell you in the
[18:09] name of the Lord, it's still
[18:12] wrong. It used to be wrong for a boy not
[18:15] to talk to a girl without her daddy
[18:17] knowing it. And some of you brothers,
[18:19] maybe you ain't been taught right. Or
[18:20] maybe you ain't got a backbone enough to
[18:22] go let her daddy know that you want to
[18:24] talk to her. Oh, we're just friends, you
[18:27] little
[18:30] slicker. Yeah, I know what I'm talking
[18:32] about. We have a
[18:34] standard. Hey, we have a standard. We
[18:37] have things in place because I don't
[18:39] trust the
[18:44] flesh. We're just friends. Yeah. Where
[18:47] do you think it starts?
[18:50] Hello.
[18:52] you start talking to him without any any
[18:55] barriers or any standard or letting a
[18:58] brother or somebody who knows something
[18:59] about it like, "Hey, I'm talking to so
[19:01] and so because if oh, if we're just
[19:03] friends, that's how it starts anyways."
[19:06] So, when you finally fall in love or
[19:07] you're emotionally attached and you're
[19:09] way down the road
[19:11] [Music]
[19:13] and you're like, "Man, maybe it'll be a
[19:14] good idea to let my dad know. Will you
[19:17] marry me?
[19:19] Come on.
[19:22] Look, I I know I sat under Brother Ron's
[19:24] ministry for 5 years. I've been in
[19:26] meetings. I I was a young person uh here
[19:29] many years ago. I I know what he teaches
[19:31] and and I know it ain't changed. But you
[19:34] know what's changed?
[19:36] Not the word of
[19:40] God. What's changed is maybe some of us
[19:43] don't want to believe it. Some of us
[19:46] don't want to receive it because some of
[19:48] us got some digging to do. We got to
[19:51] start digging into some of these ideas
[19:53] and some of these nonsense and some of
[19:55] these things that we're entertaining and
[19:56] realize these things are going to hinder
[19:58] us from going in a rapture. Hey, I'm
[20:00] just preaching the message tonight
[20:02] because I want to go in a rapture. I
[20:04] want to go in a body change. I want to
[20:06] get out of here. I want to get the last
[20:08] one. Oh, God. Just think if the last one
[20:10] was sitting here tonight.
[20:13] Hey, it could be.
[20:15] [Applause]
[20:18] Sir,
[20:20] my Bible tells me that Paul said in 1
[20:24] Thessalonians 4:4 that every one of us
[20:26] should know how to possess his vessel in
[20:28] sanctification and honor.
[20:33] He said God has not called us to
[20:35] uncleanliness but undo holiness.
[20:38] This word of God, this message of the
[20:41] hour produces holiness into individuals
[20:44] lives. And you know them by their fruit.
[20:48] You know them by the way they dress, but
[20:50] hey, I know it's not a closline
[20:52] religion, but you got to start
[20:54] somewhere.
[20:56] Because after maybe uh you get all
[20:58] cleaned up, what does it come down to?
[20:59] Character. So you can look the part, you
[21:03] can dress the part, but then when it
[21:05] goes beyond all of the stuff outside,
[21:07] what is really down there on the inside?
[21:09] It's character. And it's the pressures
[21:12] and it's the trials of life that bring
[21:14] out the character that's laying in
[21:16] there. And if you got no character,
[21:18] watch. Just let the first thing come and
[21:20] you'll find out real quick whether a
[21:21] person's born again and filled with the
[21:23] Holy Ghost or not, cuz they'll resort
[21:24] right back to that old
[21:26] nature. That's right.
[21:29] Prophet Allah goes on. He says, "Show me
[21:31] your company and I'll tell you who you
[21:36] are." Let me just say it like this. Show
[21:40] me
[21:45] your Show me your
[21:47] history. Show me your time stamp. See,
[21:50] because sometimes we allow these things
[21:52] to go right over us like it doesn't
[21:54] apply to us because we're living in an
[21:56] age where maybe certain things aren't
[21:58] said in the way they are. But I tell
[21:59] you, the message did not miss one thing.
[22:04] Do do you realize that when you are on
[22:06] the internet and you are on social media
[22:09] platforms, you are entertaining company?
[22:14] Can you imagine? Some of us will like
[22:17] and follow
[22:21] somebody who is downright possessed with
[22:24] demons
[22:26] dressing like a prostitute. I don't care
[22:29] if you went to high school with them. I
[22:32] don't care if you were Why are you
[22:34] following that nonsense?
[22:38] Hey, I'm sorry if I got here right away,
[22:40] but but I I believe in an oldfashioned
[22:43] Holy Ghost God
[22:45] living possess your vessel of
[22:47] sanctification and
[22:49] honor. And just because you ain't got to
[22:52] be going out to to to pull rooms and
[22:54] bars to do it, you can do it right here
[22:56] on your cell phone. And I tell you, in
[22:58] the name of the Lord, the Holy Ghost is
[23:00] coming to tell you tonight that's wrong.
[23:04] You've got it off on the wrong grounds.
[23:06] You've got enough on the wrong company.
[23:09] Hey, I'm not mad at you. I love you. I
[23:13] just want you to get to work.
[23:15] I want you to start digging cuz some of
[23:18] you really want the Holy Ghost. Some of
[23:20] you really want to live her overcoming
[23:22] life and you're tired of going to church
[23:24] and feeling better and then falling over
[23:27] and over and over again. I say, "Oh God,
[23:30] may we dig out all the unbelief. May we
[23:32] dig out all of our own ideas. May we
[23:34] just get it all out of the way that the
[23:36] Holy Ghost can come to each one of you
[23:38] in such a personal way that you'll be
[23:41] changed.
[23:44] Oh, glory to God. I know what I'm
[23:46] talking
[23:50] about. We've gotten on the wrong
[23:55] grounds. Show me your company and I'll
[23:57] tell you who you are. Let me walk into
[24:00] your house. Let me see what's laying
[24:02] open on the table. Remember, make it
[24:04] digital.
[24:06] You following me now?
[24:08] Y'all following me? Let me get a show of
[24:11] hands. Y'all following me?
[24:14] No, no, no. Not everybody yet. Are y'all
[24:16] following me? Because we live in a
[24:19] digital
[24:20] age. But just because we live in a
[24:22] digital age doesn't mean the prophet
[24:23] didn't preach on it.
[24:26] All right. Wonderful. Show me what's
[24:29] laying on open on your table. Show me
[24:31] the apps you got downloaded on your
[24:32] phone.
[24:35] Are you kidding me? We still We still
[24:37] got You think Netflix Are you You
[24:39] kidding me?
[24:42] You know what? I I don't know. Hey,
[24:43] we're just going to go We're just going
[24:44] to roll with it. Yeah. I I find it
[24:46] profound that some people will actually
[24:49] uh uh Well, it's it's
[24:50] PG. I mean, it's P it's not PG-13. I can
[24:53] watch PG. So, you're going to let Satan
[24:56] rate a movie and make it okay?
[25:00] God does not have a movie rating
[25:03] corridor of angels up in heaven raiding
[25:05] worldly movies so the bride of Christ
[25:07] can watch it.
[25:10] Hello.
[25:13] Hello. And we so
[25:17] easily justify things. Oh, but it's an
[25:22] animation. Why are we over here? I don't
[25:24] know.
[25:25] It's an animation from the pits of
[25:28] hell with rock and roll all laced up in
[25:32] it and you think it's okay. I tell you
[25:35] what, I don't know about that. But I
[25:37] tell you what, if those old-fashioned
[25:39] Pentecostal uh filled Holy Ghost
[25:41] disciples when they busted out on the
[25:43] upper room, I don't think there was one
[25:45] time you'd have found Peter or Paul
[25:47] sitting around on some digital device
[25:49] watching the
[25:51] Moana, whatever it is.
[25:54] Hey, I've seen some
[25:58] crazy I'm like, are you for real? I've
[26:02] watched some crazy song specials want to
[26:04] be sing and I'm like, are you for real?
[26:07] Why don't you just look where the thing
[26:09] came from? Look at the album cover.
[26:12] You'll realize, oh god, I don't want
[26:14] nothing to do with that.
[26:16] Hey, I know that ain't popular and I
[26:19] know I know we sing some songs and I
[26:20] like them and and I like it when a
[26:22] song's redeemed and we make it and we
[26:24] make it our ours, but I say we want to
[26:27] be careful.
[26:29] [Applause]
[26:32] And I'll just say it and you understand
[26:34] why I preach it like I do. It's cuz one
[26:36] time there there was a a choir song that
[26:40] was going to be sung and and it it was
[26:43] written by a a denominational uh
[26:45] contemporary group out there and and you
[26:48] know sometimes they they have good words
[26:49] and good
[26:53] inspiration on a song I really didn't
[26:55] care for. But I guess it didn't matter
[26:56] if Matthew cared for it or not. God sure
[26:57] did. He come down and pour out his
[26:59] spirit. I'm like, "Okay, well,
[27:02] hey." But I'll never forget this young
[27:05] person's response
[27:09] to and I thought, "Dear Lord, we just
[27:14] introduced. I really wouldn't want them
[27:20] listening. You think it's going to stop
[27:22] with G-rated and PGance?
[27:29] Look, I've been there.
[27:32] I got I ain't Mr. Holy up here. I've
[27:34] I've had to learn. I I've had to be uh
[27:38] those I love I rebuke and chasen. I've
[27:40] had the Holy Ghost have to tell me,
[27:42] "Son, you ain't got no business doing
[27:46] that. I found myself doing things a son
[27:49] of God shouldn't do." But you know what
[27:51] a son of God with the Holy Ghost does?
[27:54] He stands correction.
[27:56] [Applause]
[27:58] I ain't trying to tell you Matthew Mc
[28:00] Gary got it figured out. But I know I
[28:02] got the Holy Ghost. And when I have a
[28:05] question, when I need an answer, when I
[28:07] fall, when I make a mistake, he's there
[28:10] to pick me up. He's there to convict me.
[28:13] He's there to convince me.
[28:16] He's there to show me. And that's what I
[28:18] want for each one of
[28:20] you. But we got so many things haunting
[28:23] us in our lives.
[28:25] We've let so much of the Tommy rod of
[28:27] this world come in that we're satisfied
[28:30] with a good camp meeting. We're
[28:32] satisfied with a good Wednesday night
[28:33] service and we go back to all that
[28:35] nonsense. Hey, get to
[28:38] digging. Get to digging, young people.
[28:41] If there's anything the Lord wants to
[28:43] tell you tonight, get to digging. Let's
[28:45] dig it all out. Dig out all the
[28:48] unbelief, all those things that we've
[28:50] been letting the devil rob us of our
[28:52] time.
[28:54] Dig it
[28:55] out. Dig or
[28:57] die. Dig or
[28:59] die. Dig or parish. If you want to miss
[29:03] the tribulation, get to
[29:07] [Applause]
[29:10] digging. Oh, thank you, Jesus. David
[29:14] said in Psalms 19, "With my whole heart
[29:16] have I sought thee, oh sought thee, oh
[29:19] let me not wander from thy commandments.
[29:22] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[29:24] might not sin against thee. Blessed art
[29:26] thou, oh Lord, teach me thy
[29:30] statutes. Oh, I just want to let you
[29:32] know this is
[29:35] nothing. I I've sat under God called
[29:37] men, God called pastors. I've sat under
[29:41] brother David McGary. I've sat under
[29:42] brother Ron Peterson. I've sat under
[29:45] Holy Ghost five-fold
[29:48] preaching who all are
[29:51] under the seventh angel messenger, the
[29:54] message of the hour. And they're just
[29:56] saying what he said.
[29:58] Teach me thy statutes, Lord.
[30:01] When you say, "Don't hold the wrong
[30:03] company." When you say these things,
[30:06] "Teach me thy ways." Yes, Lord. Or will
[30:09] you let the Lord teach you?
[30:12] Will you let the Lord show you? But you
[30:14] know, some people they don't want to be
[30:15] taught nothing.
[30:18] And and and some people they just
[30:20] already know everything, so you can't
[30:21] teach them anything.
[30:23] But I want to say like David, teach me
[30:26] thy statutes.
[30:28] Teach me how to dress, Lord.
[30:31] Teach me how to possess my vessel in
[30:33] sanctification and honor.
[30:35] Lord, teach me how to possess my vessel,
[30:39] Lord.
[30:40] When these modern strip teasers walk
[30:41] down the road, Lord, I want to know how
[30:44] to overcome. I'm I'm tired of falling to
[30:46] the same snare over and over.
[30:49] We need the Holy Ghost. And then when
[30:51] you get the Holy Ghost, you know what
[30:53] you need to do? You need the Holy Ghost.
[30:57] We'll get there by the God God's grace
[30:59] as we go through these meetings. You
[31:00] think you're going to come up to camp
[31:02] and shout on the mountain top and I got
[31:04] the victory and go down and think it's
[31:05] going to be easy down in the valley. No,
[31:07] the prophet of God up there, you're
[31:08] fruit of freeze. But you got to go down
[31:09] in the valley and prove what you got
[31:11] whether you got it or not.
[31:14] And then if you get down there, look, we
[31:15] are not a defeated per people. If you
[31:18] get down there, make a mistake, just
[31:20] repent, get back up, say, "God, I know
[31:22] you'll let me take the test again. Give
[31:24] me the strength, oh God. If I was
[31:25] lacking the Holy Ghost, Lord, give me
[31:27] more of the Holy Ghost. If I'm lacking
[31:29] revelation, Lord, give me more
[31:30] revelation, Lord. But I don't want the
[31:32] things of the world. I want more of
[31:35] God." Oh, praise God. And if you want
[31:38] more of God, there's more of God for
[31:40] you. Those that hunger and thirst after
[31:42] righteousness, they shall be filled. Oh,
[31:46] aren't you glad you serve a God like
[31:48] that?
[31:52] Teach me thy ways, Lord. Show me your
[31:55] ways. Oh Lord, we need to look for a
[31:58] close soon. But back to our story. Y'all
[32:02] remember what our story is?
[32:04] Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, got mixing
[32:06] with their own
[32:08] company with Jerome, a borderline
[32:10] believer. The prophet of God says, "Is
[32:13] this all right?"
[32:16] He says, "Notice here, he was joining
[32:19] himself up associating with
[32:20] unbelievers." So they fixed them a a
[32:22] compass for seven days and got into the
[32:24] desert on out to fight the king of Moab.
[32:26] And when they got out there, they found
[32:27] out that they ran out of water. Their
[32:29] water supply was cut off. And the things
[32:31] go wrong when the water's cut off. Do
[32:33] you know what I'm talking about? Without
[32:34] the the the public utility. If you don't
[32:37] pay the bill,
[32:39] they cut off your water.
[32:42] I could stay there a little. You don't
[32:43] read, you don't
[32:44] pray. Come on.
[32:48] If you don't pay the bill, they cut off
[32:50] the water. You'll dry up around the a
[32:52] house. And that's the matter with God's
[32:55] people tonight. They just didn't pay the
[32:58] price. And God cut their water off.
[33:01] That's right.
[33:03] Oh boy, help us, Lord. He goes on to
[33:06] say, that's the reason some of the
[33:07] churches don't believe in divine healing
[33:09] is because their water's been cut off.
[33:11] And I wonder if that's why some of us
[33:13] are so so uh dry and so prickly and
[33:15] can't say anything good about anybody
[33:17] else cuz we ain't got no water. We ain't
[33:21] got no Holy Ghost. I say what we need is
[33:22] to be washed by the water of the word.
[33:25] Isaiah 43:43 says, "For I will pour up
[33:28] water upon him that's thirsty and floods
[33:31] upon the dry ground. I will pour my
[33:33] spirit upon thy seed and my blessing
[33:35] upon thine offspring." Jesus said,
[33:36] "Blessed are they which do hunger and
[33:38] thirst after righteousness, for they
[33:40] shall be filled." I want to tell you I
[33:44] uh friends that there is water in the
[33:46] rock tonight. There's water in this
[33:49] message. There is a real Holy Ghost.
[33:51] There is a real baptism that can change
[33:53] you. There's a real message that can
[33:55] feed your hungry soul. I want to tell
[33:57] you, there's water in the rock tonight.
[34:00] You don't have to live with the water
[34:02] cut off. You don't have to live with
[34:03] stories of the 60s. You don't have to
[34:06] live with just stories of the 50s. You
[34:08] don't have to live with just stories of
[34:09] your pastor. You don't have to live with
[34:11] just stories of brother Brandham. God
[34:13] wants to write his own story. For ye are
[34:16] written epistles, read of all men. He
[34:18] wants to baptize you and fill you with
[34:20] the Holy Ghost and get you out there
[34:22] into the streets witnessing and
[34:24] testifying about the glory of God.
[34:27] Hallelujah. There's water in the rock.
[34:31] [Applause]
[34:33] If you're hungering and
[34:35] thirsting, he'll fill
[34:37] you. Prophet of God said when Israel
[34:40] wanted something to
[34:43] eat, God fed them. They wanted water.
[34:46] There was water in the rock. He said
[34:48] when they got thirsty, they found water
[34:49] in the rock. He supplied everything they
[34:51] had need of. I want to tell you, he's
[34:53] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[34:55] He's Jehovah Gyra. Did anybody come here
[34:58] with a need?
[35:00] Anybody come here believing for
[35:02] something?
[35:05] He's Jehovah Gyra.
[35:08] God will provide.
[35:10] I like this quote just to throw this out
[35:14] there because sometimes maybe we have an
[35:17] expectation on how it's going to
[35:20] happen. How how is h how how is it going
[35:22] to happen? How am I going to be born
[35:25] again and filled with the Holy Ghost?
[35:26] How am I going to be healed? How are
[35:28] these questions going to be answered in
[35:29] my life? How are these things that I
[35:31] messed up? How is God going to make it
[35:32] right?
[35:35] Prophet of God said, "When God says
[35:36] anything, how's it going to happen?"
[35:38] Brother
[35:39] Brandham. Oh, I really want to know
[35:41] this.
[35:42] Y'all want to know?
[35:46] I don't know.
[35:48] It's none of my business to know. God
[35:51] will provide it. God will provide for
[35:54] himself.
[35:56] Amen. He's Jehovah Gyra.
[35:59] God will provide for himself. Now, look
[36:02] at here, brother Brandon. The doctor
[36:04] said that I got cancer and he told me
[36:05] that I was going to die. I got 30 days
[36:07] yet to live. He said I was going to die.
[36:08] Now, how in the world is something I
[36:11] can't see, touch, feel, smell, taste, or
[36:15] anything else. How in the world is
[36:17] something like that going to take this
[36:19] cancer out of
[36:21] me? Now, for a moment, I want you to
[36:23] start thinking about yourself. You've
[36:24] been believing for things. You have
[36:26] family situations. You got things that
[36:28] you've been praying for, and you're
[36:29] trying to wonder how it's going to
[36:30] happen. How is this going to happen?
[36:33] Yeah. Uh uh he he says, "How is he going
[36:35] to take this cancer out of me? What is
[36:37] going to come
[36:38] down?" Listen to this now. What going to
[36:43] come down here and literally move that
[36:45] cancer? Now, I I don't know about you,
[36:47] but I am believing for the supernatural
[36:49] to take place during these meetings. I'm
[36:51] believeing when brother Steven's
[36:53] ministering, when y'all are singing,
[36:55] when we're singing the songs of Zions,
[36:56] when you when you're in the service
[36:58] praying before it starts, when you're in
[37:00] here praying after the service starts,
[37:01] I'm believing for the supernatural to
[37:04] happen. I'm believing for something to
[37:06] move down. I'm believing for new births
[37:08] and changes and healings. Oh, I'm
[37:10] believing for the supernatural. I'm
[37:12] believing for supernatural
[37:13] manifestations. I I believe in the power
[37:16] of the Holy Ghost. I I believe in
[37:18] rushing mighty winds. I believe in a a
[37:20] Pentecostal experience. I ain't talking
[37:22] about Isuza Street. I'm talking about an
[37:24] upper room like a sound of a rushing
[37:27] mighty wind. Oh, he's Jehovah Gyra.
[37:29] He'll do it. If he did it then, he'll do
[37:31] it tonight. He'll do it tomorrow
[37:33] morning. He'll come and sweep through
[37:35] the room and meet your need.
[37:41] What's going to come down here and
[37:43] literally move that
[37:46] cancer second time? I don't know. But
[37:50] God promised it and God can provide
[37:53] something to do it.
[37:56] Hallelujah. God will provide. He's
[37:58] Jehovah Gyra. He's just as much Jehovah
[38:00] Gyra right now as he was then. He's
[38:02] still Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will
[38:04] provide for himself a way to make his
[38:08] word come to pass. I say you might as
[38:10] well just start praising God because it
[38:12] ain't up to us to manufacture something.
[38:15] It's up to us to believe. Lord, I
[38:17] believe your word. You said by your
[38:19] stripes, I am healed. You said if I
[38:21] repent of my sins and I'm baptized in
[38:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you
[38:26] will give me the Holy Ghost. How's he
[38:28] going to do it? Well, maybe it's none of
[38:29] my business to know, but I'm believing
[38:31] for him to do it.
[38:36] My I'm still going through our story and
[38:38] we're out of time.
[38:43] So now here Jerome, king of Israel,
[38:46] Jehoshaphat, king of
[38:48] Judah, and uh we could talk a little bit
[38:51] about a king of Edom, which boy, that's
[38:54] an interesting study right there that
[38:56] the were uh the descendants of
[39:00] uh Esau. And Edom in Hebrew means red.
[39:03] And here we go. I wasn't going to go
[39:04] this way, but really interesting to know
[39:06] these things. So they're on their 7-day
[39:08] journey. They run out of water in the
[39:12] desert. If we haven't established that,
[39:15] uh, that's a bad place to run out of
[39:19] water. If you're going to run out of
[39:21] water, do it like Minnesota in the
[39:24] summer or somewhere where there's a lot
[39:26] of water. But don't run, man. You see
[39:29] people blowing up on the side of the
[39:30] highway all the time. Like, yep, you ran
[39:32] out of water. You can't go up and down
[39:35] 17 all the time without water in your
[39:37] radiator. Going to pop.
[39:40] I mean, how many times have y'all seen a
[39:42] a car on the side of the road in ashes?
[39:46] Needed
[39:47] water. How many Christians you see burnt
[39:50] up on the side of the road? Needed
[39:53] water. Come on. How many people when
[39:56] hard trials came and problems come in
[39:59] the church and their feelings get hurt?
[40:02] Well, Brother Ron, he was preaching on
[40:04] me. I'm out of here.
[40:06] This is a message of love. Yeah, it's a
[40:08] message of correction, too.
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:12] Some of us just don't want to work. We
[40:14] don't want to dig. When the Holy Ghost
[40:16] says, "Dig," you say, "I didn't come
[40:17] here to dig. I came here to be blessed.
[40:21] I am out of water in the middle of the
[40:23] desert. God, bless
[40:26] me, oh Lord, what is your word for me?
[40:32] I'm in the middle of the desert. I am
[40:34] out of water and I'm gonna
[40:38] die. Get to
[40:40] work. Here's a shovel,
[40:43] son. Get to
[40:45] digging. Dig or die.
[40:49] Yeah. You want the blessing? Well, glory
[40:52] to
[40:53] God. Here they are out in the desert,
[40:55] run out of water, getting all prickly
[40:58] and complaining. You know, that's where
[41:00] Jerome, he was that old borderline
[41:02] believer. Oh, he's brought us out here
[41:03] to
[41:04] die. And that's the borderline believer.
[41:06] I don't know about you, but I'll just
[41:09] maybe I'll throw this in there. If you
[41:11] get into a
[41:13] trial and things are getting rough,
[41:16] start looking for the blessing. Lord, I
[41:17] know you're going to do something. But
[41:19] the borderline believer starts panicking
[41:21] and oh, we shouldn't be out there. And
[41:23] that's when Jehoshaphat said, you know,
[41:24] isn't there a prophet in the land? Isn't
[41:27] there somebody that we can inquire
[41:29] about? And that's what happened. And and
[41:31] I'll just skip the the text because like
[41:33] I said, we're out of time. But
[41:35] Jehoshaphat, he says, "Let's get a
[41:37] prophet down here." He said, "Let's
[41:39] inquire of the Lord. Let's see if the
[41:41] prophet can help us out." While
[41:43] everybody else was fussing and carrying
[41:44] on, come on. why everybody else out
[41:47] there in the world is I is wondering uh
[41:51] about the economy and and everybody's
[41:53] worried about this church and that
[41:55] church and and this family situation and
[41:57] they're just all just uh so uh so
[42:01] uncomfortable with everything's going
[42:03] out and did God bring us out here?
[42:05] What's going on? And here Jehoshap don't
[42:08] we got a message?
[42:10] Don't we got a vindicated prophet that
[42:12] we can inquire, that we can listen to
[42:14] the message, that we can have spiritual
[42:16] food in due season, that God will speak
[42:19] to our heart and he'll tell us what we
[42:21] need to
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:23] do. I don't know about you,
[42:26] but does anybody listen to the message
[42:29] of the
[42:32] hour? But do we do it to fulfill a
[42:34] religious obligation?
[42:37] By God's grace, I I I try to listen to
[42:39] the message of the hour every day.
[42:44] And you come to find out some people
[42:45] just listen to the
[42:48] message hardly ever, once or twice a
[42:51] week. So, we're going to move quickly.
[42:53] Y'all going to help me move quickly?
[42:56] So, they went down there and they drove
[42:58] up in front of Elisha's and oh, he might
[43:00] have been reading the scriptures
[43:01] perhaps. And when they all drove up in
[43:03] front, the king said he come out and
[43:05] they said, "What shall we do?" When
[43:06] Elisha got his righteous indignation all
[43:08] stirred up, he was all boiled over once
[43:10] in a while. You know, he looked at old
[43:11] Jerome and standing there and he said,
[43:13] "Why don't you just go to to the
[43:15] prophets of your daddy and your mother?
[43:16] Why'd you come to me? You he wasn't very
[43:19] peaceful, was he? Why don't you just go
[43:20] back to your pagan gods? Why did you
[43:22] come down to me, a prophet, a servant of
[43:24] the Lord, a mighty man, a double portion
[43:25] of the spirit on him? Why don't you just
[43:27] go to your mama's gods and your father's
[43:29] gods?" And listen to what he said. If it
[43:30] wasn't for the respect of the presence
[43:32] of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look at
[43:34] you when you I I wouldn't even talk
[43:35] about you. You got me so stirred up. So
[43:37] he goes on to talk about how it was the
[43:39] presence of a a a genuine
[43:42] Christian. Look, you want to know the
[43:44] only reason why America hadn't been
[43:46] blown up yet? It's because of you.
[43:50] Hey, once again, that's not my
[43:52] words. No, that's what the prophet said.
[43:54] He said, "The only reason why America is
[43:56] still hanging on, hadn't been blown to
[43:58] pieces, is because the presence of a
[43:59] real, genuine
[44:03] Christian." That was in
[44:07] 1956. Where are we at now? This thing is
[44:10] rotten to the
[44:13] core. So, he's all stirred up and the
[44:16] prophet goes on to say, "I just want to
[44:17] move through this quickly. You forgive
[44:19] me. I usually don't do a whole lot of
[44:20] reading, but when you're reading quotes,
[44:22] you can't go wrong." So, hallelujah. He
[44:24] says, "And they went on and they got all
[44:26] the music and they got to playing the
[44:28] music some real good hymn. And the first
[44:29] thing you know when the songs returned
[44:31] to Zion and when the music and the
[44:32] children began to sing from their heart,
[44:34] something take place, the spirit of the
[44:35] Lord come on the prophet." And if a real
[44:37] old-fashioned godly singing and
[44:39] repenting would bring the spirit of God
[44:41] on the prophet, then it'll do the same
[44:43] thing today. And notice he wanted to see
[44:45] the way out. And the only way out they
[44:47] could do would be to have a revival.
[44:51] Well, friends, I come here to tell you
[44:53] to start this meetings off. I want to
[44:55] have a revival.
[44:59] And how the Lord has dealt with my
[45:00] heart, if we're going to have a good
[45:01] oldfashioned revival, if we're going to
[45:04] have some questions answered, if we're
[45:06] going to have some of these real
[45:08] needs, we got young people who are in
[45:10] bondage to worldly things.
[45:14] But I believe we can have a real Holy
[45:16] Ghost revival this camp. Amen. I mean,
[45:20] really get delivered
[45:22] and not be delivered to go get bound
[45:25] again, right?
[45:28] Because it happens all the time.
[45:32] Get delivered. Hey, we can lay hands on
[45:34] the sick, they recover. We can cast out
[45:36] evil spirits
[45:39] by the power of God. We've been
[45:40] commissioned to do it. But when that
[45:42] thing shows back up,
[45:45] there needs to be the good man of the
[45:47] house there.
[45:51] We want the Holy Ghost to be
[45:53] there. Say, "It's different this time,
[45:55] devil." So, he had some repented sinners
[45:58] that come in and the music played and
[46:00] the prophet saw a vision. And the only
[46:02] way you're ever going to see your way
[46:04] out is an oldfashioned spiritual revival
[46:07] where the hallelujah of God is ringing
[46:09] from the bottom of your heart and an
[46:11] old-fashioned Holy Ghost revival hits
[46:13] the place. Then you begin to see things.
[46:16] Then God will begin to reveal things.
[46:18] Then you'll wonder why these real
[46:20] Christians are hanging on. Why they're
[46:22] praying for you. What a revival. And he
[46:24] got in the
[46:25] spirit. Oh, I'm just going to have to
[46:27] call for the musicians uh in two
[46:30] minutes. Why don't the musicians come
[46:31] and then I'll preach for a while while
[46:32] you're up here and then you'll start
[46:34] playing songs and we'll preach a little
[46:35] longer, but at least everybody will
[46:36] think we're we're quitting.
[46:42] Look, look friends. I know you've heard
[46:44] this this before,
[46:45] but the world has their delights. The
[46:48] world has their ball games. They have
[46:50] their dances. And the prophet preaches a
[46:52] whole sermon called getting in the
[46:54] spirit.
[46:56] And we're not trying to be worldly.
[46:57] We're not trying to mimic
[46:59] Pentecostalism.
[47:01] I tell you what we should do. If
[47:03] anything, you ought to understand
[47:04] they're the ones that are mimicking the
[47:05] real believer.
[47:08] They're the scarecrow.
[47:10] But some of us ain't got no joy. We
[47:13] ain't got no peace. We ain't got no
[47:15] dance. We ain't got no shout. We ain't
[47:16] got no victory.
[47:19] Now God's made us all up different.
[47:22] You can sit right there and not break a
[47:24] break break anything. But I tell you, if
[47:26] in your soul you're dancing and shouting
[47:28] and you're you're happy, well, praise
[47:30] God. That's all I want to know. And you
[47:32] got the goods to go back down to the
[47:34] valley and make it through the test.
[47:35] Praise God. If you're not always
[47:38] threatening and complaining, "Oh my, I'm
[47:40] just having such a hard time." But
[47:41] somebody asks you about it, "What's the
[47:43] hope?" You say, "Oh, he's the same
[47:44] yesterday, today, and forever. He filled
[47:46] me with the Holy Ghost 5 years ago, and
[47:48] I've never been the same." I tell you
[47:49] what, I'd rather have that kind of
[47:51] testimony than somebody running around
[47:53] the building and can't even stay off the
[47:54] website for one week. Ooh. Ah, didn't
[47:58] like that.
[48:03] But we do have something to do. We do
[48:05] have something to get excited about. And
[48:08] the prophet is telling us we got to get
[48:09] in the spirit of revival. We got to get
[48:11] in the spirit of these camp meetings. He
[48:14] says we can never have a revival in
[48:15] Shreveport or anywhere else until the
[48:18] church gets in the spirit of revival.
[48:20] God can come and perform miracles. He
[48:22] can show wonders. He can stretch forth
[48:24] his hand to heal the sick and the
[48:25] afflicted. The preacher can preach the
[48:26] gospel as hard as he can. But there will
[48:30] never be a revival until the church gets
[48:34] in the spirit of
[48:35] revival. Brother Ron, do we do we want a
[48:38] revival this weekend?
[48:40] Amen.
[48:42] I want to read this again from a
[48:44] vindicated
[48:45] prophet. Your pastor wants a revival.
[48:49] I want a revival. Is there anybody else
[48:52] here that wants a revival?
[48:56] He says, "There'll never be a revival
[48:59] until the church gets in the spirit of
[49:01] revival." The musicians would
[49:03] come. We have something to shout about.
[49:06] Yes.
[49:08] But there'll never be a revival until we
[49:10] get in the spirit of
[49:13] revival. So much we could say, but we're
[49:16] out of
[49:19] time. Prophet of God said, "Instead of
[49:21] reading the Bible, we're reading love
[49:23] stories.
[49:25] They're reading that and they're they're
[49:26] reading everything else. Come on. Let
[49:28] them talk to you. Let him do with your
[49:30] heart. Now,
[49:31] think about where you're at, where
[49:32] you're spending your time. We ought to
[49:34] be reading God's Bible and on our knees
[49:37] constantly praying for God to help us,
[49:39] awakening in our souls are crying out to
[49:41] the Lord, but we don't notice. And then
[49:44] when he said he had been he'd seen a way
[49:47] out now he said the first thing I want
[49:48] you to do is go out here and make this
[49:51] valley full of
[49:53] ditches. Dig just as hard as you can dig
[49:57] for thus sayaeth the Lord. You'll not
[49:59] see any wind or there'll be any rain but
[50:02] this valley will be full of water. The
[50:06] more
[50:08] ditches the more
[50:11] water. You didn't know you came to camp
[50:14] to
[50:15] work. But if you want a
[50:17] blessing, if you want to whip the devil,
[50:20] if you want the
[50:22] victory, get to
[50:25] digging. He said, "What did he see?"
[50:28] We're just continuing on in this
[50:30] message. He saw a vision of that
[50:32] spiritual
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] rock that Moses had already spitten and
[50:39] been speaking to. He had just spoke to
[50:42] that rock and it was ready to pour forth
[50:45] the water when the ditches was made for
[50:48] it to run
[50:49] in. Are you hearing
[50:52] me? God gave the prophet the
[50:56] answer. And the answer was, "Young
[50:59] people, you want a
[51:02] blessing? The smitten rock is
[51:07] here. Christ is here tonight.
[51:12] But we got some digging to
[51:16] do. Get to
[51:18] digging. And I say that same spitting
[51:20] rock tonight is here. And it'll pour
[51:24] forth an oldfashioned Holy Ghost revival
[51:28] that'll tear Strethart apart if you
[51:30] people will go to digging, moving all
[51:32] the difficults out. If you dig up
[51:35] against one thing, a beer can in the ice
[51:38] box, throw it out. Make way for the Holy
[51:43] Ghost. Every time you hit against a
[51:45] snag, throw the thing out. The deeper
[51:48] you dig, young people, the more water
[51:51] you'll get. So, what you have to have is
[51:54] to make way for
[51:55] [Music]
[51:58] it. Y'all ready to make way for the Holy
[52:00] Ghost?
[52:03] You ready to start digging into your
[52:05] heart? Say, "Lord, there's areas in my
[52:08] heart. There's there's hurts. There's
[52:11] disappointments. There's church
[52:13] situations. There's things I don't
[52:15] understand. My parents ain't holding a
[52:17] standard like I think they should. And
[52:21] all these things are in there. I just
[52:24] need you to start digging. Just throw it
[52:26] out. Go
[52:28] ahead. I don't know how he's going to do
[52:31] it.
[52:33] I don't know how the revival is going to
[52:35] break. I I don't know how the Holy Ghost
[52:38] will manifest
[52:39] himself outwardly on you. I I don't
[52:42] know. I just know he said he would do
[52:46] it. Somebody here, you're sick. God's
[52:49] your
[52:50] healer. I don't know how he's going to
[52:52] take that thing out of you, but I can
[52:54] stand here as a living testimony. When I
[52:56] had a tumor in my
[52:58] body, God come and took it
[53:01] out. Took that life right out of that
[53:08] cancer. I don't know how he's going to
[53:10] do it. Young
[53:11] people, one thing I know is we need a
[53:14] real genuine
[53:19] experience. Aren't you tired of
[53:22] makeelieving?
[53:25] Aren't you tired of trying to make the
[53:29] message some academic accomplishment? Am
[53:32] I talking to somebody?
[53:36] [Music]
[53:38] But what we need is a
[53:41] real experience of
[53:43] a water from the rocks.
[53:46] But Lord, you're telling me I got to
[53:48] make room for it. So I'm just going to
[53:49] start I'm going to start unpacking my
[53:51] heart and my disappointments.
[53:54] Maybe as we're finishing out these
[53:55] quotes and we're finishing the sermon,
[53:57] why don't you just start doing that,
[53:58] young people? Is there something in your
[54:00] heart you want to just go ahead and get
[54:02] out of the way? That means
[54:04] disappointments. That means
[54:06] sins. Come on. Maybe you're in bondage
[54:08] to
[54:10] something. Look, there's a real lust
[54:12] devil out there in this
[54:14] age. There there there's brothers and
[54:16] there's sisters that are in bondage to
[54:21] pornography. and now they're battling
[54:23] depression and suicide because they feel
[54:26] unworthy. Dig that thing out. I rebuke
[54:29] that devil. You ain't got to live under
[54:32] that bondage. You ain't got to live in
[54:34] fear. You ain't got to uh feel like
[54:36] you're you're you're worthless. That's
[54:37] the devil talking. Dig it
[54:39] out. Dig that thing
[54:47] out. I I don't know. I just I think of
[54:50] all them out there in that
[54:53] desert. You know, some people could dig
[54:55] a bigger ditch a lot faster than other
[54:57] people. Yeah. And boy, is that ever the
[55:02] truth. But you know what little you can
[55:07] dig? It's more Holy Ghost. It's more
[55:11] water. Maybe you say, "I'm too
[55:13] feeble." I'll help you tonight.
[55:17] I'll pray for you.
[55:19] I'll dig with
[55:20] you. I might not be able to relate. You
[55:23] know, some of you have lost loved ones
[55:25] that it's tearing you to
[55:30] pieces. I I can't relate. But I know a
[55:36] God. He can be a comforter to the widow
[55:38] and the widowerower.
[55:40] And he can be a father to the
[55:43] fatherless, a mother to the motherless.
[55:47] Why don't you make way for him tonight,
[55:49] young
[55:52] people? No matter how much preaching
[55:54] there
[55:56] is, how many visions there are, the
[55:58] subject was then and the main principle
[56:01] was make ready for
[56:03] water. Get the ditches dug. That's what
[56:07] we got to do tonight is make way for the
[56:11] Holy Ghost to pour
[56:13] down. Make way in your house. Make way
[56:15] in your church. Make way in yourself.
[56:18] Kick everything out of the way. Get
[56:21] ready. Get ready. There's coming a
[56:24] gusher. Hey, that's not the words of a
[56:27] man. That's the words of a vindicate. Do
[56:30] you believe it?
[56:32] I say, church, make ready.
[56:35] [Music]
[56:38] Get it all out of the way.
[56:42] Come on. Help me, young people.
[56:45] Some of you are really
[56:46] [Music]
[56:49] hurting. You got a broken home and you
[56:51] don't know why, but you believe this
[56:53] message and you're wondering when when
[56:54] it's all going to get fixed
[56:57] up. Some of you have have made some
[57:00] really bad
[57:02] mistakes and you just want to give
[57:08] up. Just lay it out on the
[57:11] altar. I'm thinking it out, God.
[57:16] And what did he say? We're going to have
[57:18] a revival this
[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] weekend. Get
[57:24] ready. I like
[57:27] that. Don't get disappointed. Don't get
[57:30] scared. Some of you nervous right now
[57:32] cuz the Holy Ghost is dealing with
[57:34] hearts right now. Why don't you tell
[57:36] that old nervous spirit to get out of
[57:39] here? Oh yeah. Yeah. Now, the Holy Ghost
[57:43] is walking right up and down these
[57:44] aisles right now dealing with hearts and
[57:46] some of you get
[57:49] nervous because you might not be ready.
[57:51] I say, "You better get
[57:53] digging." If our song leader would come,
[57:57] just start, we'll start singing a song.
[58:00] I I don't want to let go of this too too
[58:04] fast. Get the ditches dug. Young
[58:10] people, are you hearing me
[58:13] tonight? Get to digging. Brothers, get
[58:16] to
[58:17] digging. Sisters, get to
[58:20] digging. You want the Holy Ghost? You
[58:23] want a
[58:25] revival? Get the ditches
[58:29] dug and then get
[58:32] ready cuz we're about to have an awesome
[58:34] weekend.

[58:50] with the Holy Ghost. People are going to
[58:52] be healed. Hard questions are going to
[58:55] be answered. Why? Because I'm digging.
[58:58] I'm digging. I'm making room. I'm
[59:00] throwing out my bad habits. I'm throwing
[59:03] out my complexes. I'm getting it all out
[59:05] of the way. Oh Lord, I'm throwing out
[59:08] the bitterness. I'm throwing out the
[59:10] disappointments. Oh, I've been in
[59:11] bondage to this and I've been in bondage
[59:13] to that, but I'm throwing it all out.
[59:15] Lord,
[59:17] I'm making
[59:19] way. Go ahead, brother. Take me deeper.

[1:12:45] listen to our hearts. Second verse.
[1:12:50] And if words could fall like
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] rain. Oh, from these lips of
[1:13:03] mine. And if I had a thousand

[1:14:13] what an awesome God you
[1:14:17] are. The words are not enough to tell
[1:14:22] you of our love. So listen to our
[1:14:29] hearts. Yes. We will use the words we
[1:14:34] know.
[1:14:36] to tell you
