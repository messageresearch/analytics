[27:18] you, brother. It is uh once again a
[27:21] privilege to be found in the house of
[27:23] the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Uh while
[27:26] we have our Bibles, while we're still
[27:29] standing, we'll take a quick reading in
[27:33] the book of Exodus, chapter 30, verse
[27:37] one. Then we'll jump to 6
[27:43] to8. Exodus 30 verse1. And thou shalt
[27:47] make an altar to burn incense upon of
[27:51] hood shalt thou make it. Verse
[27:54] 6. And thou shalt put it before the veil
[27:58] that is by the ark of the testimony
[28:00] before the mercy seat that is over the
[28:03] testimony where I will meet with thee.
[28:06] And Aaron shall burn their their own
[28:09] sweet incense every morning. And when
[28:11] dressed up the lamb the the lamps, he
[28:14] shall burn incense upon it. And when
[28:18] Aaron lightth the lamps at even, he
[28:21] shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual
[28:25] incense before the Lord throughout your
[28:28] generations. Amen. May the Lord bless
[28:30] the reading of his word. You may be
[28:31] seated.
[28:34] Uh we'll uh are
[28:37] continuing
[28:39] our subject here. We started uh what
[28:43] house will thou built
[28:45] me? We'll take uh a
[28:49] little subject of a sweet incense out to
[28:52] the Lord. continuing that we have
[28:55] started uh this will be I believe part
[28:57] five but God's grace uh we are
[29:01] continuing seeing that uh God dealt with
[29:05] Abraham and told him that his seed shall
[29:10] be enslaved in a foreign land but his
[29:13] mighty hand it shall bring them forth
[29:15] and shall possess the gate of the
[29:18] enemies
[29:20] throughout we saw that uh God had his
[29:23] program that his ch children had to
[29:26] follow all the children of Israel down
[29:29] the path. Uh we see that uh they had
[29:33] made the choice
[29:35] to choose from the lambs and the goats
[29:38] and this lamb and goats will have to be
[29:41] the atonement to allow them the way out
[29:45] of Egypt. And from Egypt, we got into
[29:48] the wilderness whereby the land had uh
[29:52] the children of Israel have to build got
[29:54] a tabernacle. But we understand that the
[29:57] tabernacle is not the tabernacle made
[29:59] out of uh men hands. But it is that we
[30:04] are that tabernacle being built. Amen.
[30:07] Uh Baron preaches us that message, what
[30:10] house will thou built me? A very
[30:12] profound, deep message. Uh we covered uh
[30:15] the outer court, the holy place and and
[30:19] here we are before we get into the holy
[30:22] of holies. We are covering
[30:27] the table of incense
[30:29] whereby the Lord is uh expecting the
[30:33] children of the priest that we are uh
[30:37] the high priest to burn incense upon it.
[30:41] Uh the Bible interprets itself quickly
[30:44] here in the uh book of Revelation
[30:47] 5:8. And when he had taken the book, the
[30:51] four beasts and four and 20 elders fell
[30:54] down before the lamb having everyone of
[30:57] them of them hops and golden vows full
[31:00] of others which are the prey of saints.
[31:03] Amen. uh whereby we see that Revelation
[31:06] chapter 4 takes us uh in front of uh the
[31:11] throne. Uh as we see also the golden uh
[31:15] the table of incense also takes us right
[31:18] in front of uh getting to the ark of the
[31:21] covenants. And here we are we see that
[31:24] the incense that was to be offered unto
[31:27] the Lord at the prayer of the saints. Um
[31:31] we understand that uh in the
[31:34] word prayer is not a random thing that
[31:39] we go about to to pray but it usually
[31:43] comes with a certain purpose. Prayer for
[31:46] the sick, prayer for revelation, prayer,
[31:49] prayer for all different things. But
[31:52] here we are talking mainly on the u
[31:55] principle of prayer. So we are able to
[31:59] apply it to whatever that we have need
[32:02] of. Understanding that uh this subject
[32:05] we are taking it also at home. Um which
[32:10] is giving
[32:11] us the Lord gave us an opening back home
[32:16] for as a family uh my wife and I and
[32:19] everything that we are going through. uh
[32:23] he I say like he will be so nice to
[32:26] share it with the church but we time
[32:29] will fell us in every single place uh
[32:32] and I was even reviewing some of my
[32:34] notes and and seeing some of the places
[32:38] that we've dealt with before I say well
[32:41] it's a eternal word we'll never we'll
[32:44] never finish it but uh we glorify the
[32:46] Lord for his leadership the way we are
[32:49] going with it uh in this time that
[32:54] um we are living in, we are building
[32:58] this tabernacle of the Lord. It is very
[33:01] important for us to pray in such a
[33:04] manner that with an objective and
[33:07] purpose. Uh we can surely pray for many
[33:11] things in our lives. uh let it be for
[33:14] money, let it be uh for certain
[33:17] independence of uh certain wisdom and
[33:20] all these things is fine. But um when we
[33:23] pray according to God's program, it's
[33:26] the most perfect way for us to be able
[33:29] to pray as we are seeing that
[33:33] um the prayer of
[33:35] saints there were throughout the seven
[33:38] church ages. Revelation 1 to3,
[33:41] Revelation 4 it say come up hither.
[33:43] Revelation five uh they were looking
[33:46] straight at the throne. And I believe
[33:48] also in uh the tabernacle here when the
[33:52] tabernacle is being built, the priest
[33:55] when he's come coming to offer the
[33:57] incense, he's offering the incense
[34:01] looking toward the day that the veil
[34:03] will be opened so he can get into
[34:06] because uh the the Lord said, you know,
[34:08] when you build this table, it has to be
[34:11] offered so that the people the priest
[34:14] can be able to get in one of these days.
[34:17] That's the Bible says in Job 8 verse 8
[34:21] and 9. For inquire I pray thee of the
[34:25] former age and prepare thyself to search
[34:28] of the fathers. For we we are about of
[34:32] yesterday and we know nothing because
[34:34] our days upon an on upon earth are are a
[34:39] shadow.
[34:40] uh job is showing
[34:43] the work that we are living or the
[34:46] tabernacle that we are building is as if
[34:49] we were born
[34:50] yesterday. Uh when we look at uh the
[34:53] time that the world is going through
[34:56] it's almost like we are just a shadow
[35:00] and it requires us to inquire of the
[35:03] former age. And when we are looking at
[35:05] the former age we are looking at the
[35:07] Bible. We are looking at the message and
[35:10] this former age is showing us all the
[35:13] pattern that is given unto us of what is
[35:17] going on and how should we pray and how
[35:20] should we address prayer. Uh in the book
[35:24] of uh Daniel whereby uh I'll uh take
[35:27] into this time uh that we are living in.
[35:31] We see that Daniel was a man in Babylon
[35:35] and in Babylon he was such a time where
[35:39] he they went into captivity born in sin
[35:43] sheep iniquity as we are and uh we come
[35:46] to this world speaking lies and all of a
[35:48] sudden then when we inquire from the
[35:51] former age and of all the prophets that
[35:54] have told us we quickly understand that
[35:57] we have a time limited unto us that
[36:01] quickly we seeing already the setting
[36:03] sun. Amen. It says u in the first year
[36:08] of Darius the son of uh Aaserus the seed
[36:11] of Mides uh which was made king over the
[36:14] realm of Calaldanss. Uh the way that
[36:17] Daniel was uh describing the land in
[36:21] which he was living in is almost the
[36:23] same way as we are seeing the events
[36:25] that are taking place in the world
[36:27] today. Daniel was so defined, was so
[36:31] detailed that in the days he was living
[36:34] in the first year of uh the pope and the
[36:39] sec or first year of the
[36:41] president certain things were happening
[36:44] in the land. And he says like you know
[36:47] in the first year of his reign I Daniel
[36:50] understood by books just as we read from
[36:53] Job for inquire I pray thee. It is
[36:57] necessary that when we see an election
[37:00] going on in the land, it's not a random
[37:03] thing, a random event for us just to say
[37:06] like, you know, oh, we have a new pope
[37:08] or we have a new president and he's
[37:11] shaking the world out there. But Daniel
[37:14] inquired and he says, I understood by
[37:17] books the number of the years where
[37:20] where of the word of the Lord came to
[37:22] Jeremiah the prophet. So Daniel was not
[37:26] just roaming around the church and or
[37:29] roaming around the world because he was
[37:31] a a well-favored man, a man that went
[37:34] into um the land of the Caldes and uh
[37:39] became one of the governors or one of
[37:41] the best governors in the land just as
[37:44] we can simplify it to our world today.
[37:47] you know somebody who has uh good
[37:50] businesses and who has tremendous
[37:52] success in his life. But then when all
[37:55] these events were taking place, he
[37:57] understood by the word of the Lord that
[38:00] came to William Brham, God willing, u
[38:03] Jeremiah the prophet, if it's the Lord's
[38:05] will that we'll try to get into deep
[38:08] into it in the time to in the near
[38:10] future. Amen. and I set my face unto the
[38:14] Lord to seek by prayer and supplication
[38:18] with fasting and sacklo and ashes. We
[38:21] see that Daniel understands that the
[38:23] time in which he was living in. It was a
[38:26] such a tremendous time. He reconciled as
[38:30] a historian to look back at what time
[38:34] are we living in? What is happening in
[38:36] the land? what type of events are being
[38:39] rolled up in in uh uh in the event in
[38:43] the land he was living in and he
[38:45] understood that this is no more time to
[38:47] just be a good church member. Amen. But
[38:50] then the word is definitely gives us the
[38:54] details. He said well I need to go into
[38:57] prayer. I need to have a supplications.
[39:00] I need to understand what what am I
[39:04] supposed to do? Should I just keep going
[39:06] to church? Should I just keep uh
[39:10] building businesses, planting my
[39:11] tomatoes? Or what are the next steps
[39:14] forward? It's like somebody going to an
[39:18] interview. He understand that you know
[39:20] what can you do? He say well our company
[39:23] is growing to such a two digits and we
[39:26] need somebody to come and fulfill this
[39:29] year. But he also has to inquire what
[39:32] what will be my job description?
[39:35] What am I supposed to bring? What am I
[39:37] supposed to do? Right? And they will
[39:40] inquire of
[39:42] him. What is it of your experience will
[39:45] you be able to bring to the table to
[39:48] move this job or this company forward?
[39:51] What of all this understanding that we
[39:55] have learned, we have seen from building
[39:58] the tabernacle out of uh the outer court
[40:01] out of Egypt and all how to cast out
[40:04] imaginations and and the senses of the
[40:07] of the spirit that we are bringing now
[40:11] into prayer to be able to look forward
[40:14] onto the next step forward
[40:17] because otherwise it's just a nice
[40:19] teaching or just another sermon that we
[40:21] have heard in the
[40:23] church. But then because we know the
[40:25] promise that is, you know, one of these
[40:27] days, heaven and earth shall pass away.
[40:30] Amen. That's right. This earth has to go
[40:33] back to where it came from.
[40:36] Surely we have taken care of this flesh
[40:38] in many manners that we know about. We
[40:42] go to the doctors and we go to the gym
[40:44] and we get all kind of surgery, but we
[40:47] know it's bound to fail. That's right.
[40:52] Therefore also Daniel understood by
[40:54] books that the time that they were
[40:56] allotted in Babylon was coming to end as
[41:00] we seeing all the events that the
[41:02] prophet uh u prophecies coming to
[41:06] pass. Sure we do inquire by books and we
[41:10] read and we listen to tapes and stuff.
[41:13] Then what is the next step forward?
[41:15] Amen. Amen. And uh watch Daniel goes
[41:20] about said and and I prayed unto the
[41:22] Lord my God and made my confessions and
[41:26] said, "Oh Lord, the great and dreadful
[41:28] God, keeping the covenant and mercy to
[41:31] them that love him and to them that keep
[41:34] his commandments, we have sinned and
[41:36] have committed inquiry in iniquity and
[41:40] have uh done wickedly and re have
[41:43] rebelled even by departing from the
[41:45] percept accept and from thy judgment.
[41:48] Neither have we hearkened unto thy
[41:51] servants the prophets which spake in in
[41:55] thy name to our kings, our princes and
[41:58] our fathers and to all the people of the
[42:01] land. Daniel when he was praying he was
[42:04] not just praying individually for
[42:06] himself but he understood by books as we
[42:10] have seen that uh in we have inherited
[42:13] some of the traits of our family
[42:15] members. That's right. And he said like
[42:18] you know we have seen from our parents
[42:21] our governors and he is looking from the
[42:26] country from the level from uh from the
[42:29] country from the government uh from the
[42:31] world and he's saying that the world is
[42:34] coming to an end. Amen. The reign of the
[42:37] cales is coming to an end. And now
[42:40] there's now a step a door opening up.
[42:44] Amen. Because when the time the seven
[42:46] church ages was coming to an end,
[42:48] another door was opening up. That's
[42:51] right. And now this John has to be taken
[42:54] up
[42:55] higher. And he's looking and say like,
[42:58] you know, I have to make my confessions.
[43:01] I have to be right
[43:03] because if the priests could try to go
[43:06] over into the Holy of Holies without
[43:09] being sanctified, without being made
[43:12] ready, will be stricken dead right away.
[43:14] That's right.
[43:16] So then Daniel is understanding said,
[43:20] "We have seen our kings, our prince, our
[43:24] fathers, and all the people of the
[43:26] land."
[43:29] Well, that's not my issue. I'll just
[43:31] pray and this is just my life. No, we
[43:34] pray for even people that we don't know
[43:37] their lives about.
[43:39] We pray for the people that we are aware
[43:42] their lives
[43:44] about. Why? Because we
[43:47] understand that that body will not be
[43:50] made perfect except every one of us be
[43:53] present. Amen. That's why those who go
[43:56] on before us cannot be made perfect
[43:59] without us. That's right. And as we are
[44:01] working, Daniel is understanding the the
[44:04] time and the seasons in which he is
[44:07] living in. He's saying that, hey, this
[44:10] is no time for us just to go and try to
[44:13] start divisions among us as being
[44:16] highminded and uh and living after the
[44:18] flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[44:20] pride of life. Right?
[44:23] and he's understanding that this is the
[44:24] time to put away all these uh earthly
[44:27] elements to embrace the journey to have
[44:30] our eyes focus into the holy of holies.
[44:33] Help us Lord and the Bible says as we
[44:36] read it that you shall offer incense in
[44:38] the morning you shall offer incense at
[44:40] evening.
[44:42] Jesus said that pray without ceasing.
[44:46] Pray always. Amen. Pray until
[44:52] Yes. Oh Lord righteous verse four uh
[44:55] seven sorry belongth unto thee but uh oh
[44:59] Lord righteousness belongth unto thee
[45:01] but unto us confusion and of
[45:04] faces as at this day the men of Judah
[45:08] and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem and
[45:12] unto all Israel that are near and that
[45:16] are far off.
[45:19] Regardless of where the person is, we
[45:21] are concerned.
[45:23] Amen. Does my child's life hindering the
[45:28] growth of the
[45:29] church? Or do we just leave the child?
[45:32] Oh, he's a grown man now. He can just
[45:34] leave however he wants to live and I'll
[45:37] bring him to
[45:38] church. But Job said, "I'll sacrifice
[45:40] for my children." Perhaps they've sinned
[45:43] against the Lord, right?
[45:46] offering these sacrifices because he
[45:49] understands that the work that I
[45:52] have, I can be so right with God, but my
[45:56] children might not have come to that
[45:58] level. Right? My elders in the land may
[46:02] have walked away from the principle of
[46:04] God. My parents could have backslide.
[46:07] Now it is now my
[46:09] responsibility understanding the time
[46:11] and season. Yeah.
[46:14] seeing how the prophecies are coming to
[46:17] pass.
[46:19] I cannot leave them alone because the
[46:22] principle requires that when Moses goes
[46:25] into Egypt, not one hoof or one single
[46:30] child shall be left behind. Amen. All of
[46:33] us, we're coming out. Thank you, Lord.
[46:35] And Daniel is standing is understanding
[46:37] the time and season. He's inquiring by
[46:41] the books and his understanding that
[46:44] this is now the time for us now to get
[46:46] out. Right. Yes. Amen.
[46:50] Oh Lord, verse 9, to the Lord our God
[46:53] belongeth mercy and forgiveness. Though
[46:57] we have rebelled against him, neither
[46:59] have we obeyed the voice of our of the
[47:02] Lord our God to walk in his laws which
[47:06] he has said before us by his servants
[47:08] the prophets. Yeah. All Israel have
[47:11] transgressed thy law even by departing
[47:14] and they might not obey thy voice.
[47:17] Therefore, the curse is poured upon
[47:20] us and offer that is written in the law
[47:23] of Moses, the servant of God, because we
[47:27] have sinned against him. Amen. And he
[47:30] have confirmed his word which he spake
[47:32] against us and against our judges that
[47:35] judged us by bringing upon us a great
[47:38] evil. For under the whole heaven have
[47:41] not been done has have been done upon
[47:45] Jerusalem. People who go to
[47:47] church, but they're still roaming
[47:49] around. Amen. It's almost a walk of
[47:52] death.
[47:55] The church doesn't reach the level way
[47:57] where out to reach. Why? Because
[47:59] somebody has gone and stolen the mantle
[48:03] of the Babylonian. That's right. Because
[48:06] somebody God has uh has promised us to
[48:11] have such a victory. But then Joshua
[48:13] said, "No, no, no, no, no. The results
[48:16] that we are seeing in the land is not
[48:18] what God has promised us. Because God
[48:22] had told our father Abraham that we
[48:25] shall possess the gates of the enemy.
[48:27] That's right. We are to be standing and
[48:32] bringing all things under our feet.
[48:35] Amen. Amen. But the results that we are
[48:38] seeing is not the case. We finding
[48:41] ourselves still in the flesh, right?
[48:44] why we still finding ourselves so
[48:47] highminded. But then this tabernacle
[48:49] that we are building, we understand that
[48:52] we have to make a stop at some point.
[48:54] That's right. We're not just building
[48:56] building. I'm going to put long dresses
[48:59] and I live now. I don't put high heels
[49:01] and things. But now it also time to
[49:04] repent before the Lord. Amen. To inquire
[49:07] of him. a prayer night, a sweet incense
[49:12] unto the Lord
[49:14] tonight. And he says, "And he's
[49:16] repenting." And now verse 15, "And now,
[49:19] oh Lord our God, that has brought thy
[49:22] people forth out of the land of Egypt
[49:24] with a mighty hand is rem presenting all
[49:28] these promises, the things that God has
[49:31] done previously before them." They said
[49:33] like, "Lord, we are in a foreign land.
[49:38] We are in this
[49:39] flesh. We are so caught up in this land.
[49:43] But look at what you did there. Verse
[49:45] 16. Oh Lord, according to all thy
[49:48] righteousness, I beseech thee. Let thine
[49:51] anger and thy furry be turned away from
[49:54] the city of Jerusalem, thy holy mountain
[49:56] that we are. Because for our sins, and
[49:59] for the inquiry of our fathers,
[50:02] Jerusalem, thy people are become a
[50:05] reproach to all that are about us. Now
[50:08] therefore, our God, hear the prayer of
[50:11] thy servant, and his supplications, and
[50:14] cause thy face to shine upon thy
[50:16] sanctuary that is desolate. for the
[50:19] Lord's sake. Oh my
[50:22] God, incline down and hear and hear.
[50:26] Open thy eyes and behold our desolation.
[50:32] Daniel is being conscious of his state.
[50:35] Amen. The state of his people. Yes.
[50:40] It's not trying to just pray to open the
[50:45] service, but he's praying consciously,
[50:49] right? Lord, look at what is happening
[50:51] among us. Help us, Lord. This is not a
[50:55] person who goes about like, oh, this
[50:57] brother did this and that brother that.
[50:59] No, no, no, no, no. He's aware of what's
[51:02] going on in the land.
[51:05] Not necessarily by going and sending
[51:07] emails. What do you know about this one?
[51:09] That what do you know about that one but
[51:12] we'll find how you able to find all
[51:15] these things because with Jeremiah I
[51:18] believe the Lord will take him up or
[51:21] Ezekiel and say come I'll show you what
[51:25] the elders of Israel are doing in the
[51:28] hiding because he's the
[51:31] understanding the power of prayer.
[51:35] at junction time. Amen. When the
[51:38] prophecies are being fulfilled, they're
[51:41] being conscious that this is not the
[51:43] time for us to go about and uh sending
[51:47] emails and spying
[51:49] and recording people in the background
[51:52] and background check according to the
[51:55] credit score out
[51:57] there. But he's doing this work
[52:00] according to the prophecy. That's right.
[52:03] And as the prophecies being fulfilled,
[52:06] it sets his mind into a channel. And as
[52:09] we are building this tabernacle, it sets
[52:12] our mind into a certain channel. Amen.
[52:15] Lord, look at my flesh.
[52:18] I have seen that I have inherited anger
[52:20] from my parents. I've inherited complex
[52:23] from my country or family or background,
[52:26] whatever that is.
[52:28] But this is not out to be.
[52:36] 19 Oh Lord, he Oh Lord forgive. Oh Lord,
[52:40] he can
[52:41] undo. Defer not for thy own sake, oh my
[52:45] God, for thy city and thy people are
[52:49] called by thy
[52:51] name. He's bringing the Lord so close to
[52:54] him. Said, Lord, look at who you dealing
[52:57] with.
[52:58] Look at in what condition that we are
[53:01] in. Because as the earth is groaning for
[53:06] deliverance, Yes sir. for the birth of
[53:09] this new body that we are building
[53:12] inside this tabernacle that we are
[53:15] building. It requires sincerity. Amen.
[53:18] It requires humility. It requires time
[53:22] that at home prayer meetings has to rise
[53:26] and and stand and consciously bringing
[53:28] the children, bringing the family,
[53:31] bringing the wife, bringing all the
[53:34] business that we have in our lives under
[53:37] subjection so that we can be ready for
[53:40] that departure. Amen.
[53:43] True.
[53:44] Brother Bernham says Gabriel Gabriel's
[53:47] instruction to Daniel 81. And if Daniel
[53:50] the prophet of the Lord could consult
[53:52] Jeremiah's book and bring him to such a
[53:55] place that even Israel coming out all of
[53:58] them alive was coming out of Babylon to
[54:01] go back to the homeland will cause him
[54:04] to fast with slo and hashes. How much
[54:08] more are it to be to do to the church of
[54:11] the living God? Amen. to know that the
[54:13] time is fading out and shall be no more
[54:16] and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:19] and the great millennium ready to set in
[54:24] such a time that that that all these
[54:27] prophecies are being fulfilled before
[54:29] our
[54:30] eyes and Daniel understood that this is
[54:33] the time we're going back the prophet
[54:36] says how much more the bride of Jesus
[54:39] Christ that's right seeing that of Time
[54:42] is running
[54:44] out. Seeing that he's appearing at hand.
[54:48] Seeing that the rapture at
[54:50] hand, what are we what in what state
[54:54] supposed should we be in? How can we
[54:58] spend wasteless time
[55:00] gambling, swimming whole on
[55:03] Sundays, no time for the Lord, just run
[55:07] down? If the pastor speaks on something
[55:09] another that you don't like, you get up
[55:11] and you go out. And if uh the church
[55:15] holds too long, why you dissatisfy?
[55:19] Look at our condition. Amen. Look at we
[55:26] doing being able to
[55:29] understand to see the conditions that we
[55:32] are in.
[55:34] What are we doing? Amen. consciously and
[55:38] consciously compare our lives with that
[55:40] prophet. One man in a complete kingdom
[55:45] with no church to go to and nowhere else
[55:48] to go to. It was torn down and burned
[55:52] down. His city, his people was captive
[55:56] 60 years 68 years 68 years. He he had
[56:01] two years left. So when he begin to read
[56:04] in the books and to see the time was
[56:07] drawing nigh to full to be fulfilled, he
[56:10] went to God in prayer to find out about
[56:13] it. Amen.
[56:16] Help us, Lord. Because that's what we
[56:18] seeing
[56:20] today. A new pope shall come
[56:23] fulfilled. We need to make America great
[56:26] again. We're seeing it around us.
[56:29] We see communism trying to shake the
[56:31] world on one end of one another. We see
[56:34] it from the prophecy. Amen.
[56:38] Then what is our state? What is our
[56:40] condition?
[56:43] He prayed and he inquired from the Lord.
[56:47] Lord understand where I came
[56:50] from. Understanding what country am I
[56:53] in?
[56:55] understand the condition of my
[56:58] family. Understand the condition of my
[57:02] church. Some are being pulled away. Some
[57:04] are being pulled in. Some are being
[57:07] shaken left and
[57:10] right. Yes, I believe that I am
[57:12] righteous. Yes, I believe that I am the
[57:15] I am
[57:16] consecrated. But my prayer is not just
[57:18] for myself. Amen. But my prayer is for
[57:22] my people. That's right. is for the city
[57:25] of Jerusalem.
[57:28] Because if I alone will make it to
[57:31] heaven, what kind of heaven will it be?
[57:34] Right. That's right. Good question.
[57:36] Because Baram say mothers will never be
[57:39] complete without the children over
[57:41] there. Amen.
[57:43] What will the father say if they can
[57:45] find the children over there? Baram say
[57:48] hello I love this brother with a
[57:50] raptured family. The father is saved.
[57:52] The mother is saved. The children are
[57:54] saved. Now the church ought to look into
[57:57] ourselves too. Amen. Look at our
[58:00] families.
[58:02] It's not your just your direct family
[58:04] but your extended family. Right. And all
[58:07] that you can call your family the bride
[58:09] of Jesus Christ.
[58:12] Because the rapture is being delayed
[58:16] because people are not being ready.
[58:18] That's right.
[58:20] Once we can understand start seeing the
[58:23] scope of work the work that we have to
[58:26] do our job will be our prayer life will
[58:30] be way different. Amen.
[58:38] Supernatural 56 they just moved
[58:41] on. God never put that in there for
[58:45] nothing. God never put never come for
[58:48] just an a a a half a hazard way. But
[58:54] this prayer that we are talking about
[58:57] prayer is not a
[58:59] perhaps prayer is a sincere thing. Amen.
[59:03] Prayer is talking to God. We just seen
[59:07] how Daniel was talking to God.
[59:10] Prayer is not get down, shut your eyes,
[59:12] and thinking about your washing and all
[59:15] your work you're doing. Say, "Lord, help
[59:17] me and and John and and heal Mrs. John
[59:21] and so forth." That's not prayer. True,
[59:25] brother. That's repeating some words.
[59:28] Yeah. But prayer is to come into an
[59:31] atmosphere
[59:34] where you realize that you're in the
[59:36] presence of God. And God is moving to
[59:39] Dan in the deepest of sincerity
[59:43] because Daniel was moving in such a
[59:46] condition. Yes sir. is understanding the
[59:49] time and season. Otherwise, we we just
[59:53] Lord we we come to church and thank you
[59:56] Lord for the service and the good word
[59:58] and we go back home.
[1:00:00] Even God him even yourself you can feel
[1:00:03] like yeah
[1:00:05] I really nothing. Amen. But then when
[1:00:09] you start getting into that atmosphere,
[1:00:12] you start getting closer to him with
[1:00:14] that sincerity
[1:00:16] because you cannot speak of sincerity in
[1:00:20] this tabernacle. You can't understand
[1:00:23] the state of your mind, the state of
[1:00:25] your
[1:00:26] flesh. Because with that flesh, with
[1:00:29] everything that came along with that
[1:00:32] flesh and the the cultures that you have
[1:00:35] and everything that you have, that's
[1:00:37] what you're bringing to bring to the
[1:00:39] Lord. Amen. Lord, look at my condition.
[1:00:42] This is who I am according to the word,
[1:00:44] according to the pattern. It doesn't
[1:00:46] align. Look at this. This is what I'm
[1:00:48] struggling with. I'm highminded. I am
[1:00:50] this. I'm I I am always carnal. I'm
[1:00:53] always gossiping and I'm always doing
[1:00:55] this here. You taking all these things
[1:00:58] and you're bringing it before the Lord
[1:01:00] under such a condition and say Lord this
[1:01:04] is the junction of time. Amen. This is
[1:01:07] the time for me to go out
[1:01:10] but I am heavy loaded.
[1:01:14] I can build the tabernacle the weight
[1:01:16] according to the pattern because I am
[1:01:19] clinging to this thing so much. That's
[1:01:22] right. Yes.
[1:01:25] What house will thou build me? Because
[1:01:28] this tabernacle is to be a house of
[1:01:31] prayer. Amen. A house of supplications.
[1:01:36] Brother, pray for me. I'll be on the
[1:01:38] pulpit tomorrow. I have to trust him
[1:01:42] that he is a house of prayer. But then
[1:01:45] he but then when Joe uh what is his
[1:01:48] name? Jonas they say like you know let's
[1:01:50] pray. The guy goes to sleep.
[1:01:53] That's right. Because his condition
[1:01:55] would not allow him to come before the
[1:01:58] Lord. Amen.
[1:02:00] Many of us when we bring prayer
[1:02:02] meetings, prayer requests, we they can
[1:02:05] pray for about it. Why? Because the
[1:02:08] condition of the soul,
[1:02:11] the condition of the mind. The mind is
[1:02:14] at work. The mind is in other places and
[1:02:17] running after women even being in
[1:02:19] church. Amen. and not understanding the
[1:02:23] junction of time in which we are living
[1:02:25] in. Help us Lord.
[1:02:28] He looks he say like you know that's a
[1:02:30] sincere
[1:02:32] thing but prayer is to come into an
[1:02:35] atmosphere where you realize you're in
[1:02:37] the presence of God and you moving to
[1:02:39] then in the deepest sincerity first it's
[1:02:42] a worship. Yes. Oh Jehovah how I love
[1:02:45] you. Take time in your prayer. Yes sir.
[1:02:49] Don't be in a rush. Amen. Look at your
[1:02:52] calendar. If you have to leave at 6:00
[1:02:53] p.m., 6:00 a.m., wake up at 4:00 a.m.
[1:02:57] Amen. It's even actually the good time
[1:02:59] for you for to
[1:03:01] pray. But say at that time all the
[1:03:04] devils are tired coming from the bars
[1:03:06] and the clubs and everything. Amen. Now
[1:03:09] the channel is open.
[1:03:12] Yes. Amen. Because himself he said I
[1:03:14] believe they were in felon if I'm not
[1:03:16] mistaken. He said like, you know, the
[1:03:18] brother didn't know where I was. Around
[1:03:20] 4:00 a.m. I stood up and I started
[1:03:22] praying all the way till 9:00 a.m. until
[1:03:24] then the angel started walking. I
[1:03:26] started hearing the steps.
[1:03:31] Prayer, a sincere thing.
[1:03:35] If the prophet for those meetings he
[1:03:38] could consecrate himself so
[1:03:42] much for him to be able to get into
[1:03:44] those prayer meetings or preaching the
[1:03:47] word and things how much more as we sing
[1:03:52] all these events being made clear by
[1:03:55] vindicated prophecies. Amen. Help us
[1:03:58] Lord. Our prayer level or prayer
[1:04:02] understanding turns around. is no more
[1:04:05] the same type of prayer of uh bless this
[1:04:08] brother here, bless the service and no
[1:04:10] no this is now a different type of
[1:04:12] prayer. Amen.
[1:04:14] A prayer that understands the urgency of
[1:04:17] the hour, right?
[1:04:20] The urgency is upon me. I cannot roam
[1:04:22] around and start walking and and just
[1:04:25] walk around and say like, you know, I'm
[1:04:26] praying, I'm praying. No, no, no, no. We
[1:04:29] praying consciously
[1:04:30] that this tabernacle be made ready.
[1:04:33] Amen. for that departure.
[1:04:36] Amen.
[1:04:38] You see it? Then after the worship of
[1:04:41] prayer, then you come with a sincere
[1:04:44] heart
[1:04:45] asking. Daniel did it. And here see now
[1:04:49] the prayer of
[1:04:50] Nemiah chapter 1 verse verse 5. and
[1:04:54] said, "I beseech thee, oh Lord, God of
[1:04:56] heaven, great um the great and terrible
[1:04:59] God that keepeth covenant and mercy for
[1:05:02] them that love him and observe his
[1:05:04] commandment. Let thine hear, let thine
[1:05:07] hear now be attentive, and thine eyes
[1:05:10] open that thine mayest hear the prayer
[1:05:13] of thy servant which I pray before thee
[1:05:16] now day and night." Remember the
[1:05:19] instance has to be given day and night.
[1:05:21] Amen. For the children of Israel, thy
[1:05:24] servant, and confessed the sins of the
[1:05:26] children of Israel, which have sinned
[1:05:28] against thee. Both I and my father's
[1:05:31] house have
[1:05:35] sinned. Oh, brother, you know, my family
[1:05:38] is good. My children are fine. No, no,
[1:05:39] no, no, no, no. Be sincere. Amen.
[1:05:44] Job said that, you know, maybe they
[1:05:47] did. He didn't have all the recordings.
[1:05:50] He didn't have the GPS that pinpoint the
[1:05:52] child in a in a club somewhere.
[1:05:56] He didn't have somebody take a picture
[1:05:59] of his son running with women
[1:06:02] around. But he understood by books.
[1:06:05] Amen. That we are born in sin,
[1:06:07] sharpening iniquity.
[1:06:09] That the children first attraction is
[1:06:12] sin. Right. And this child needs to be
[1:06:15] brought back into the land. and it puts
[1:06:19] us into prayer and
[1:06:21] supplications. It's not condemnation of
[1:06:23] those who are weak among us, but instead
[1:06:26] is a lifting the hands of the ministry.
[1:06:29] Amen. Because remember when we spoke
[1:06:31] about the ministry of the sanctuary,
[1:06:33] we're not coming here to try to bring a
[1:06:36] strange fire, but we bringing a sweet
[1:06:40] sweet uh uh smelling incense onto the
[1:06:43] Lord. Amen. It's like the Lord remember
[1:06:47] us. We have sinned.
[1:06:49] Yes, myself. I have sinned. But in this
[1:06:53] time that we are walking in, please pay
[1:06:56] attention to our supplications.
[1:06:59] Please
[1:07:01] forgive. Please answer us. Daniel is
[1:07:04] inquiring, if you forgiving us, then
[1:07:07] what what is the path forward?
[1:07:11] What are we supposed to do? Right?
[1:07:14] Because when William Brham was praying,
[1:07:16] the angel of the Lord came to him. Pray
[1:07:19] for uh for Billy. Billy was in
[1:07:23] trouble. He was not about
[1:07:26] to talk down to him and you not
[1:07:29] listening and all this here. No. To
[1:07:31] start fussing with the children, with
[1:07:34] the husband or wife, and oh, I'm
[1:07:36] suspecting you. You being suspicious.
[1:07:38] Who are you talking on the phone? What?
[1:07:40] No. No. No. No. No.
[1:07:44] But understanding on how to navigate the
[1:07:47] junction of time. Amen. Otherwise we
[1:07:50] finding ourself into fight into uh
[1:07:54] feisting ourself and then before you
[1:07:56] know it it's 911 on the phone and it's
[1:07:59] domestic abuse and all kind of things
[1:08:01] and then the family tore apart. We just
[1:08:04] didn't understand in which time we
[1:08:06] living in. That's right.
[1:08:10] We just not understanding that the devil
[1:08:12] is roaming around like a lion seeking
[1:08:15] who to devour. Amen. Amen. He probably
[1:08:20] will come through as a to you as a
[1:08:22] father, he will come to you as a mother.
[1:08:25] But the junction of time will have to
[1:08:27] make us
[1:08:28] understand that despite of everything
[1:08:30] that we're saying that oh the pope is
[1:08:33] conservative and he's telling the the
[1:08:35] gay people like your whole family is
[1:08:38] made out of a man and woman. Understand
[1:08:41] that the devil is cunning. That's right.
[1:08:45] He may appear
[1:08:48] as the one that will bring the world
[1:08:50] into place
[1:08:53] but when people shall say peace and
[1:08:55] security
[1:08:57] then is sudden destruction. Amen. But
[1:09:00] then to the bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:09:02] understanding by the books. That's
[1:09:05] right. We understand by prophecy
[1:09:08] what is happening? Where are we going?
[1:09:12] What kind of work supposed should we
[1:09:14] supposed to
[1:09:15] do? Nemiah 1:11. Oh Lord, beseech we I
[1:09:19] beseech thee. Let night down here and be
[1:09:23] attentive to the prayer of thy servant
[1:09:25] and the prayer of thy servant who desire
[1:09:27] to fear thy name and prosper and I pray
[1:09:32] thee thy servant this day and grant him
[1:09:36] mercy in the sight of this man. For I
[1:09:39] was the king's cup bearer despite of his
[1:09:42] position. Nemiah, Daniel, whatever your
[1:09:46] position is. The understanding that the
[1:09:49] constraint that can come about with
[1:09:52] whatever position we
[1:09:55] holding. Sometimes we can't make it to
[1:09:57] to the service. Why? Because we have to
[1:10:00] go make
[1:10:02] money. See where prayer goes. Amen. It's
[1:10:06] opening those areas. Lord, I can be
[1:10:08] there in service. I can have time for
[1:10:11] prayer. I'm working long hours. Lord,
[1:10:14] can you open a way that can I can be
[1:10:17] able to have time with the family? Amen.
[1:10:21] All that is linked wrapped into this
[1:10:25] principle of prayer.
[1:10:27] In the junction of
[1:10:30] time, Psalm 55, even and morning at noon
[1:10:35] I will I pray and cry out loud and you
[1:10:38] shall hear my voice. He have delivered
[1:10:41] my soul in peace from the battle that
[1:10:44] walks against me. For there were my were
[1:10:47] many with me. all these troubles and I
[1:10:51] cannot do this and my children are not
[1:10:53] listening and I cannot do this and I am
[1:10:56] busy with
[1:10:58] this. The Bible is showing us prayer.
[1:11:01] Amen. Even morning evening morning at
[1:11:05] noon will I pray and cry out loud and he
[1:11:10] shall hear my voice.
[1:11:13] 119 Let I pray thee, thy mercy,
[1:11:17] kindness, and be my comfort according to
[1:11:20] thy word unto thy servant. Let thy turn
[1:11:23] of mercy. Psalm 119 uh verse
[1:11:29] 76. Let let pray thee thy mer thy that
[1:11:32] merciful kindness be for my comfort
[1:11:35] according to thy word unto thy servant.
[1:11:38] Let that turn of mercies come come upon
[1:11:40] me. Come unto me that I may live for
[1:11:44] thine law is my delight. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:49] Watch where prayer is taking the
[1:11:52] people in such a sincerity. Say the Lord
[1:11:56] it is my delight to stay in
[1:11:58] prayer but look at all these activities
[1:12:02] that I have to attend to. Can you open
[1:12:05] the way? Yes. So I can be able to be
[1:12:09] free to spend time in prayer in the
[1:12:11] morning. At times you work overnight,
[1:12:16] you come back home so tired and the
[1:12:19] children can't see you, daddy has to go
[1:12:21] to
[1:12:22] sleep. But then when we start
[1:12:24] understanding these things, we become
[1:12:27] conscious of what kind of prayer we're
[1:12:29] bringing to the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:32] Psalm 122 6-9.
[1:12:37] Pray for the peace of
[1:12:38] Jerusalem. They shall prosper that love
[1:12:42] thee. Peace be within thy walls and
[1:12:45] prosperity within thy palaces. For my
[1:12:48] brethren and my companion's sake, I will
[1:12:51] now say peace be within thee. Because of
[1:12:55] the house of the Lord our God, I will
[1:12:58] seek thy God.
[1:13:02] All this prayer that is being offered
[1:13:04] unto the
[1:13:05] Lord, we see that it's not only for
[1:13:09] ourselves, but for Jerusalem's sake.
[1:13:11] Amen. Peace be upon Jerusalem.
[1:13:15] Peace be upon you, my brethren. That
[1:13:18] when we come together, let it be a house
[1:13:21] of peace. Amen. A house of prayer, a
[1:13:24] house of supplication, a house where the
[1:13:27] sweet incense is being presented unto
[1:13:30] the Lord. The prayer, the good smelling
[1:13:33] before the Lord in such a fellowship
[1:13:35] with God. Yeah. Lord, we understand our
[1:13:40] condition. But yet at the same time, we
[1:13:43] look back in the books at time like
[1:13:46] this. You brought the great prophet
[1:13:49] Moses. In time like this, you brought
[1:13:52] the great prophet
[1:13:54] Brandon and you gave him all the great
[1:13:57] successes that he has had in his life.
[1:14:00] What about us? Amen.
[1:14:05] And while the Daniel 9 and while I was
[1:14:08] speaking and praying and confessing the
[1:14:10] my sins and the world this uh and the
[1:14:13] sin of my the of my people Israel and
[1:14:16] presenting my supplications before the
[1:14:18] Lord my God for the holy mountain of my
[1:14:21] God. Yeah. While I was speaking in
[1:14:23] prayer, even the man Gabrielle whom I
[1:14:27] had seen in the vision at the beginning
[1:14:29] being a coast to fly sweetly touched me
[1:14:33] about the time of the evening oblation
[1:14:35] in at the time of prayer. Amen. At the
[1:14:39] time of offering incense
[1:14:41] again when you pray when we
[1:14:45] pray we need that angel to appear.
[1:14:48] That's right.
[1:14:50] We need that still small voice to come
[1:14:52] about. Amen. Otherwise, it's just, you
[1:14:55] know, we pray. I prayed. I hope uh God
[1:14:58] will answer me with my conditions and I
[1:15:01] think it's going to work out. I
[1:15:04] hope that's not what the book is showing
[1:15:07] us. That's not what we're learning from
[1:15:09] the book. That's right.
[1:15:13] And he 22 and he informed me and talked
[1:15:16] so talked with me and said oh Daniel you
[1:15:19] replace with your name I am now come
[1:15:22] forth to give this skill and
[1:15:25] understanding
[1:15:28] of the time in which you living
[1:15:31] in. It's not just like, you know, the
[1:15:33] pastor will come and preach us about
[1:15:35] what's going on with the pope and with
[1:15:37] the country, the economy, and and then
[1:15:39] the pastor will tell us what job to go
[1:15:41] take and what kind of prayer we should
[1:15:43] be. No, no, no, no, no, no. He
[1:15:45] understood that we are building a
[1:15:47] tabernacle. Amen. For the holy mountain
[1:15:50] of my God, I've confessed my sins. I've
[1:15:54] confessed the sin of my people. Then if
[1:15:57] we have be we are sincere in this type
[1:16:00] of prayer then the man Gabriel has to
[1:16:03] come forth.
[1:16:06] Praise the Lord. The man Gabriel has to
[1:16:09] come forth. Is that so? Yes
[1:16:12] sir. At the beginning of my
[1:16:14] supplications the commandment came forth
[1:16:17] and I am come to shooty and for thou are
[1:16:21] greatly beloved. That's why you are the
[1:16:23] beloved bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:25] Therefore, understand the matter and
[1:16:29] consider the vision. Amen.
[1:16:32] Consider what house are you building.
[1:16:34] That's right. Consider what is said the
[1:16:37] work that is set before us. Consider
[1:16:40] what kind of people are we called to be.
[1:16:44] Not earthly bound people coming to
[1:16:46] church at times. Not coming to church at
[1:16:48] times. Yes, all the struggles are coming
[1:16:51] about. So we can be able to take all
[1:16:54] these things and bring them into prayer.
[1:16:57] Amen. Help us Lord.
[1:17:01] Al Shai paragraph A. Here's people
[1:17:05] that's coming up now to giving their
[1:17:08] life to Christ. Some of the personal
[1:17:10] workers workers walk with them. You come
[1:17:14] somebody else that needs Christ walk
[1:17:17] down here at the altar. I'll tell you
[1:17:19] friends, as I said the other night,
[1:17:22] you've heard so much mighty rushing
[1:17:26] winds and so many earthquakes and and so
[1:17:30] many shaking things and till you've
[1:17:32] failing to hear that last
[1:17:37] one. What was that last? A still small
[1:17:41] voice. Amen. Yes,
[1:17:45] we come, we listen to the word and we
[1:17:46] go, we go about this, we go about this.
[1:17:49] I prayed, I prayed, I prayed, I prayed,
[1:17:50] brother, I'm say stay a little longer,
[1:17:54] right? Wait a little bit.
[1:17:58] That's why I say when you look at your
[1:17:59] calendar, yes, you have to leave home at
[1:18:01] 6, wake up early so you can give him
[1:18:04] time.
[1:18:06] You give him times for him to speak
[1:18:09] because God is never in a rush. That's
[1:18:11] right. He's we are in rush. He's never
[1:18:13] in
[1:18:15] rush because when Gabri uh Daniel
[1:18:18] started praying the angel was given
[1:18:20] commandment to
[1:18:21] go but then the
[1:18:25] traffic from that dimension to this
[1:18:27] dimension he was
[1:18:29] in the traffic of thoughts
[1:18:32] and will I pray enough? What am I going
[1:18:35] to pray? That
[1:18:37] traffic makes the channel so crowded and
[1:18:41] so clogged that the angel can't get to
[1:18:44] us.
[1:18:47] You've heard so much mighty winds and
[1:18:50] left and right and stuff. Wait a little
[1:18:53] bit. Wait a little longer. Amen. And
[1:18:58] when Daniel comes is to give you
[1:19:01] understanding. It's still small voice.
[1:19:03] There's something in your heart that
[1:19:05] says, "Oh yes, yes, there it is. I see
[1:19:09] it." What do you see? The
[1:19:13] vision. What do you see? What God, what
[1:19:16] type of tabernacle you building in this
[1:19:19] hour? What do you see the bride of Jesus
[1:19:23] Christ? Where do you see God's program
[1:19:25] in this hour? Amen.
[1:19:29] Otherwise, what kind of people are we?
[1:19:31] Right? We just go about church, go back
[1:19:34] and come back home and and and live our
[1:19:37] lives and fall in sin and and all this
[1:19:42] here. Oh, if we could wake up, we if we
[1:19:46] could we could wake up to
[1:19:48] that, that's what we
[1:19:51] need. Who could pray a prayer that would
[1:19:54] dedicate these people over? I don't
[1:19:57] believe there's a minister in the world
[1:20:00] can do it. Listen to what the prophet
[1:20:03] says. You have to do it yourself. Amen.
[1:20:10] That's the pro pastor. No, no, no, no,
[1:20:12] no. It is my
[1:20:14] job. It is your
[1:20:18] job. Let's not leave everything to
[1:20:20] Moses. Moses, do the work. No, no, no.
[1:20:25] You have to get to your knees. Amen.
[1:20:28] Daniel the great prophet prayed. Nemiah
[1:20:32] also prayed. Ezra also prayed.
[1:20:37] All of them under the same understanding
[1:20:40] that the program of God, the kingdom
[1:20:43] that we are building, the the the the
[1:20:45] the house that we are building is not
[1:20:48] some random things. We understand the
[1:20:51] pattern. We understand all these things.
[1:20:53] We go into supplications.
[1:20:56] We look away to him. Amen.
[1:21:00] Luke 22. And he came out and went and
[1:21:03] and was and as he w he went to the mount
[1:21:07] of of olives and and disciples also
[1:21:10] followed him. And when he was at the
[1:21:12] place, he said unto unto them, "Pray
[1:21:15] that ye enter not into temptation." And
[1:21:18] he was withdrawn from them about uh a
[1:21:22] stonecast and kneel down and prayed
[1:21:25] saying, "Father, if thou be willing,
[1:21:29] remove this cup from me. Nevertheless,
[1:21:32] not my will but thy will be done." He
[1:21:36] was look at the condition. He was not
[1:21:38] praying just for himself. He understood
[1:21:41] that his prayer it was not just about
[1:21:44] him. Amen.
[1:21:48] Daniel prayed. What happened? The angel
[1:21:50] appeared. Verse 43. And there appear
[1:21:54] appear an angel unto him from heaven
[1:21:57] strengthening him. Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:02] I'm showing the pattern of things.
[1:22:04] That's right. Amen. That when we say
[1:22:06] that I have
[1:22:08] prayed, when we say that I have
[1:22:10] consecrated
[1:22:12] myself, there's a certain result that we
[1:22:15] have to have. Amen. No, no, no, no, no,
[1:22:18] no. The angel only appeared to
[1:22:26] brotherham
[1:22:29] expectations. And notice this is a
[1:22:32] believer in the church. And notice all
[1:22:34] this just gets right next to me when I
[1:22:37] think of it. Now Simeon probably out out
[1:22:42] somewhere in prayer room or outside of
[1:22:45] the temple not only in church of course
[1:22:48] and maybe that morning there would
[1:22:51] probably be 50 children will say
[1:22:54] standing in the line of circumcision but
[1:22:57] notice just when Mary just brought Jesus
[1:23:01] the Holy Spirit spoke to Simeon.
[1:23:05] Yeah. It's not just the prophet, right?
[1:23:09] The Holy Spirit spoke to Simeon. Amen.
[1:23:12] And what did he say? Simeon uh uh spoke
[1:23:16] spoke to spoke to Simeon somewhere else
[1:23:19] outside and he was laid by the Holy
[1:23:22] Spirit right straight to the Christ
[1:23:25] child. Amen. coming at the very instant,
[1:23:28] picked him up in his arms and said,
[1:23:31] "Lord, let your servant depart in peace,
[1:23:34] for I have seen your salvation." Amen.
[1:23:38] Hallelujah. Prayer. Amen. It's not a
[1:23:41] perhaps. That's right. It's not a maybe.
[1:23:45] Yeah, I'll pray and yeah, I will see.
[1:23:47] I'll leave it to the pastor. No, no, no,
[1:23:49] no. You have to do it yourself.
[1:23:52] Amen. Come on. True. Simeon had to do it
[1:23:57] himself. Jesus had to do it himself.
[1:24:00] Then the angel appeared.
[1:24:04] The forms in the shapes. We've said it.
[1:24:07] The voice, the the the child Christ, the
[1:24:11] angel, all these forms must give us the
[1:24:15] answer to what we're supposed to do.
[1:24:18] Because Daniel
[1:24:19] inquired, "Well, I come to you,
[1:24:22] Gabrielle. I come to you so you can have
[1:24:25] skills and
[1:24:28] understanding, what is the promise given
[1:24:30] unto
[1:24:33] us? Is the change of the body given unto
[1:24:36] us today?" He has a promise. Is the
[1:24:39] rapture a promise to us? Are the
[1:24:42] prophecies being fulfilled around us?
[1:24:44] Yes. Are we aware of what's going on in
[1:24:47] the world? And if we are aware, if we
[1:24:52] are heavy laden, let's go to him and he
[1:24:55] shall give us rest. Amen. Thank you,
[1:24:59] Lord. The contest, brother Bernham says,
[1:25:01] and we'll be closing here
[1:25:04] quickly. Heavenly Father, paragraph 338.
[1:25:07] Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as
[1:25:10] many thoughts is dying out in our hearts
[1:25:13] and and of the mistakes of last
[1:25:17] year, Daniel cried of the mistakes and
[1:25:20] all the disobedience and everything they
[1:25:23] did. Nehemiah did the
[1:25:26] same. And here, brother Brenam is
[1:25:28] standing. He said like, you know, of the
[1:25:29] mistakes of last year. And as we
[1:25:32] approaching the death of 62 and the
[1:25:35] birth of
[1:25:37] 63, oh God, may we be one step higher up
[1:25:42] the
[1:25:43] ladder until we can see Jesus and his
[1:25:48] program. Amen. Help us, Lord.
[1:25:51] Prayer is not a maybe. Come on. Prayer
[1:25:55] is not just thinking about this fellow
[1:25:57] here, but at the junction of time in
[1:26:00] which we are living in
[1:26:03] that the the beast and the image of the
[1:26:05] beast are working so rapidly.
[1:26:09] Then what should Daniel do in this
[1:26:13] hour? We have seen the mistakes that we
[1:26:15] did living in culture, living after the
[1:26:18] flesh and being highminded and all these
[1:26:20] things. But then as we let us get a step
[1:26:25] higher the ladder. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:31] Until we can see Jesus and his program.
[1:26:35] We all know what happened afterward in
[1:26:38] 63. That's the result of prayer. Amen.
[1:26:42] It's not some random thing, right?
[1:26:46] You pray about something, God has to
[1:26:48] bring it to pass.
[1:26:50] And why is it bringing to pass? Even
[1:26:53] Jesus said that like you know you
[1:26:54] receive not because you are praying a
[1:26:56] miss.
[1:26:59] We praying you know Lord I need to be
[1:27:01] the big man in the city. I need to be
[1:27:03] the great man here. I need to to be this
[1:27:05] one here. No no no no no no. Take the
[1:27:08] program ask Jesus what is your program.
[1:27:12] Amen. And then start praying. If my word
[1:27:15] abides in you then ask what you will.
[1:27:19] That's right. And then when you start
[1:27:21] asking according to God's will,
[1:27:24] everything comes up so quickly.
[1:27:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. We see that in
[1:27:30] the word, right?
[1:27:33] Because when the angel came to uh to
[1:27:36] Abraham under the tree, he said like,
[1:27:38] you know, next year the promise shall be
[1:27:40] fulfilled.
[1:27:42] When the cloud came down, the word must
[1:27:45] be
[1:27:45] open. When the you come before the
[1:27:48] altar, the angel must go take the book
[1:27:50] and open the book.
[1:27:54] Result of what? Prayer. That's right.
[1:27:57] Amen. The angel came to John. Come up
[1:27:59] here. I'll show you things that are here
[1:28:03] after. Where's the angel of the Lord
[1:28:05] among
[1:28:06] us? We leave him in in 65 and we leave
[1:28:10] him in the pictures.
[1:28:13] Prayer. Amen. Let him come off the the
[1:28:17] pictures. And let him become a living
[1:28:20] God. Amen. We need him alive today.
[1:28:24] A united church understanding the
[1:28:27] responsibility. What kind of house we
[1:28:30] are building. That's right. Because all
[1:28:33] the other houses will be brought down.
[1:28:36] Only one city shall stand is the holy
[1:28:39] mountain of Jerusalem. That's right.
[1:28:42] All the rest will be cast away very
[1:28:45] quickly according to the prophecy of
[1:28:48] course. May everyone here Lord in prayer
[1:28:51] while the old year is dying and the new
[1:28:54] birth uh the new birth of the new year
[1:28:57] is coming in. May the old man's sin and
[1:29:00] unbelief die out in our hearts and the
[1:29:03] new birth come in with the
[1:29:06] uh 1963 of the next minute like a
[1:29:11] rushing mighty wind that might fall
[1:29:14] might fill our beings and make us new
[1:29:17] creatures in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:29:23] Notice the result of prayer. The angel
[1:29:26] of God. Now
[1:29:27] notice if you can
[1:29:30] believe if you can believe now many of
[1:29:34] the miracles that are performed I always
[1:29:38] see them in my room in prayer before I
[1:29:42] come to the building. Amen.
[1:29:46] We're not just walking around randomly.
[1:29:48] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:29:50] When you come to
[1:29:52] church, pray it
[1:29:55] up. God has to show you for it. We not
[1:29:59] just coming to preach, you know, brother
[1:30:01] Martin come and preach. No, no, no,
[1:30:05] no. Brother Brenam is saying
[1:30:08] us. He
[1:30:11] is our wave.
[1:30:14] Amen. Our example. That's right. As he
[1:30:18] did with the prophet, so shall he do
[1:30:20] with us. Amen. When he's in prayer, many
[1:30:25] of the miracles that are going to take
[1:30:29] place, he sees them before he comes to
[1:30:32] the pulpit. Amen.
[1:30:37] When the child is about to get into
[1:30:40] trouble, are you surprised by the call?
[1:30:43] Oh my god, I need to go home. Hey, but
[1:30:46] my child. No, no, no, no, no,
[1:30:49] no. That already shows us in what type
[1:30:52] of condition we are in. Amen.
[1:30:57] That shows us like you know if
[1:30:58] everything just catches us by surprise
[1:31:01] then we are in a very concerning
[1:31:07] condition. I am surprised you this has
[1:31:10] happened to me my my my children and I
[1:31:12] can understand this child doesn't
[1:31:13] listen. I spoke to him. No, no, no, no,
[1:31:15] no, no, no, no. Leave ahead of those
[1:31:18] times. Amen.
[1:31:20] Before those struggles happen, God has
[1:31:23] to show you.
[1:31:27] That's the
[1:31:28] prophet. The angel came to him, "Don't
[1:31:32] defile your body. Don't drink. Don't do
[1:31:34] this here because when you shall grow,
[1:31:37] I'll have a ministry." He knew that my
[1:31:39] life, I'm living it according to a
[1:31:41] promise. Amen.
[1:31:44] He went, "Mama, I've seen a bridge 16
[1:31:47] people fall into the the river." How how
[1:31:50] how is it going to
[1:31:53] happen? Why? Because angelic visitation,
[1:31:57] right? A prayer of supplications get us
[1:32:01] into a channel.
[1:32:03] Amen.
[1:32:08] to close here.
[1:32:11] 2
[1:32:14] Chronicles chapter 2, behold verse 4,
[1:32:18] behold I build an house to the name of
[1:32:21] the Lord my God to dedicate it to him
[1:32:25] and to burn him sweet incense and for
[1:32:29] the uh continual showbre and for the
[1:32:32] burned offerings morning and
[1:32:35] evening on the Sabbath and on the new
[1:32:38] moons and on the solemn feast of the
[1:32:40] Lord our God. This is an
[1:32:43] ordinance forever to Israel. Amen.
[1:32:50] Continually I am building this
[1:32:53] tabernacle so I can offer incense unto
[1:32:56] the
[1:32:57] Lord. Praying without ceasing. I'm
[1:33:00] continually in this house. I'm building.
[1:33:03] Lord, I'm struggling with the flesh.
[1:33:05] Lord, you remember me. Lord, remember
[1:33:06] me. You go on the next step. Are you
[1:33:09] dealing with your spirit? Lord remember
[1:33:10] me. Lord remember me. And so
[1:33:14] on. All these stages the angel is seeing
[1:33:19] is coming to help us. Amen. Thank you
[1:33:22] Lord. Building a house to the Lord. A
[1:33:26] sweet smelling favor onto the Lord. It's
[1:33:29] not a perapse.
[1:33:32] Amen. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:33:33] today and forever. Our time is passed. I
[1:33:36] want to challenge your faith. Now that's
[1:33:39] a great big statement for a person to
[1:33:41] make. But I just want to I want to give
[1:33:43] you this uh to uh to give you in this
[1:33:47] manner. Think you uh uh you think of
[1:33:50] yourself now you Methodist, you Baptist,
[1:33:54] Pentecostal, whatever you are. If you
[1:33:57] are to contend for that
[1:33:59] faith and we believe that Jesus is ro
[1:34:02] from risen from the dead, this same man
[1:34:06] that made that challenge that time I
[1:34:08] said you can prove you can't prove one
[1:34:12] thing that there is a God outside of the
[1:34:14] supernatural. Listen to this. For when
[1:34:18] omnipotence speaks, the miraculous takes
[1:34:22] place. Omnipotence can speak without
[1:34:26] bearing miraculous. Amen. Is that right?
[1:34:29] That's right. We can come and pray and
[1:34:32] say like you know, oh the Lord. No, no,
[1:34:33] no, no. If the omnipotence has spoken,
[1:34:38] if we have a message in this hour, the
[1:34:42] miraculous must take place. Amen. the
[1:34:44] angels must
[1:34:46] appear. What is the state of our our our
[1:34:50] um of our
[1:34:52] prayers? We just pray and we we go on
[1:34:56] and musician if you can
[1:34:59] come. We just we pray we pray however we
[1:35:01] want to pray and and then there's no
[1:35:04] miraculous. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:35:06] Something must take place, right? Watch
[1:35:10] that pattern of uh of the scriptures.
[1:35:12] All the people in the
[1:35:14] world they stood conscious of the time
[1:35:17] in which they were living in right
[1:35:21] where we can say Lord my faith looks up
[1:35:23] to thee. Thou lamb of Calvary Savior
[1:35:28] divine now hear
[1:35:31] me while I pray. Amen. This prayer time,
[1:35:36] a prayer meeting, prayer
[1:35:39] time. Is your flesh so hard that it
[1:35:44] defies the word of God? That means the
[1:35:46] omnipotence didn't come
[1:35:49] forward. Is your spirit, your culture
[1:35:52] too hard that the word can contain it?
[1:35:56] That means the omnipotus didn't come
[1:35:58] forward because when he speaks, the
[1:36:02] miraculous takes place. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:04] All the flesh is torn down. All the
[1:36:08] spirit, the mind battles are quietened
[1:36:12] quickly. And then the angel is appearing
[1:36:16] to do what? Let us see you, Lord. And
[1:36:18] your program. Amen. Amen. Let us see
[1:36:21] Jesus appearing unto
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:26] us. What did the prophet do for the
[1:36:30] angel to appear to him?
[1:36:32] What did Abraham do for them to appear
[1:36:36] to them? To
[1:36:39] Daniel, to Zachchariah, to Mary
[1:36:44] and Simeon,
[1:36:46] Anam. Now that we are surrounded by this
[1:36:49] cloud of
[1:36:52] witnesses, what is our position? Amen.
[1:36:55] Shall we
[1:36:56] pray? Heavenly
[1:36:59] Father, surely Lord, a time of prayer,
[1:37:03] not just for sermon and but Lord that to
[1:37:07] remind us Lord Father God of this
[1:37:09] important part and
[1:37:11] step into building the tabernacle.
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:16] a sweet influence and
[1:37:19] smelling all the fragrance onto you and
[1:37:24] even in the
[1:37:26] morning at noon time.
[1:37:29] Father, we want to give you Lord Father
[1:37:31] God our old being as oh Father God is a
[1:37:35] sacrifice a house of
[1:37:37] prayer where Lord Father we saying Lord
[1:37:40] Jesus Christ our church our brothers and
[1:37:42] sisters and the times in which we are
[1:37:45] going through let your word Lord Father
[1:37:48] God be with us Lord yes Lord lead us
[1:37:51] along the way in
[1:37:52] humility places where about Lord Father
[1:37:54] God revelation didn't strike to
[1:37:56] understand is pardon Lord Father God of
[1:37:59] the scripture. Let the angel of the Lord
[1:38:02] who follows the prophet's message go
[1:38:05] after each one of us Lord and reveal
[1:38:08] Father God accordingly Lord Jesus and
[1:38:10] wherever Lord Father God we shall meet
[1:38:13] again. Let us Lord Father God walk
[1:38:15] closer more in love and respect and
[1:38:18] remembrance Lord of your princip Lord
[1:38:21] every day of our life. We ask all these
[1:38:24] things with thanksgiving in Jesus
[1:38:26] Christ's name.
[1:38:27] Amen. Amen. May God bless you. God bless
[1:38:31] you, brother.
[1:38:34] Let's all
[1:38:36] stand. I need
[1:38:40] more
[1:38:42] of
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:47] you. That's the way it's got to be.
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:54] I need
[1:38:55] more
[1:38:57] of
[1:39:01] you till there's no room left in
[1:39:09] me. All those
[1:39:12] wasted hours and
[1:39:16] minutes, they're yours
[1:39:19] now. From the start to the
[1:39:22] finish, I need
[1:39:25] more
[1:39:27] of
[1:39:31] you. If that's your desire, just lift
[1:39:34] your hand this
[1:39:36] evening. Will I need
