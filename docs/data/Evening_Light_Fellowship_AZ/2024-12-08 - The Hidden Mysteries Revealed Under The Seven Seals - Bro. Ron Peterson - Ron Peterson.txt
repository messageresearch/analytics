visitors here uh from the wedding and have stayed over and we welcome you all in the name of the Lord and uh it was there's always something different about weddings that happen very special things that happen and uh anyway uh as we're up here and we're saying the things and I I I told Brother Martin I said well when I say the vows you and uh different things you say I do at the end well I had just said do you take this woman to be your lofly wedded wife I do I had I had a whole paragraph to read and he was just I do it's like get it over with let's you know and so uh I have never seen Martin Smile as much as he did the whole time he's just had a big smile on his face and so there's always something special about weddings huh brother Abel God bless you good to have you and brother jeanpierre here with us God bless you richly amen each and everyone brother Kim hilderbrandt God bless you good to have you and and sister Linda here and and all of you that are here with us today we greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ got some things in my heart this morning let's just remain standing go directly to the word go to Revelation chapter 17 Revelation chapter 17 verses 1-6 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her her I wondered with great admiration may God add the blessing of the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in his presence now we know that Revelation is a book of symbols you've got to understand those symbols or you don't understand the book you don't understand what the Lord is trying to say but here we have a m Myster and it's called mystery Babylon and um she is doing something which is going to have an effect upon everyone on the earth it affects us today it greatly affects everything and all everything that is around us and all of you need to be extremely aware of this yes lest those influences of Babylon creep and permeate right into your lives that was the sin of achen do you remember what he did he took Babylonian garments and wedges of silver and of gold and he put them into his his home thinking what I do in my home will not affect anyone else well when one member suffers the whole body suffers so we understand and we say who am I excuse me preacher's voice is always a little hard getting started so you just bear with me and if I have to clear my throat a time or two that's okay so we understand that these things are happening right here in America today the prophet of God said that I do not see any other country that so embolizes or the epitome of Babylon as what America does today so we see the Babylonian Kingdom that started that was the beginning of it and that Babylonian influence comes right on down into today I wish to read a couple more scriptures here before I elaborate on this and I'll give you my sermon title in a moment brother Mark second Thessalonians if you would 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and then we're going to read 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and so while brother Mark is turning to 2 Thessalonians 2 I want you to understand that um even when brother Brenham began to bring into the church the understanding of Holiness before the Lord and beg got he began to talk about how women dress and everything and the reason that he spoke on women was because women is a type of the church you want to see where they're at look at the women it will give you the reflection and so the prophet of God um was given all kinds of excuses from the different system who said well but that's all they have to sell out there and he said but they still sell sewing machines they still sell material where you can go and you can make your own and that's good again for today but I just hope that there are sisters that the mothers have taught their daughters how to sew or to sew on a button or to darn a sock there wasn't many amens on that and how to cook amen yeah you teach the younger women these things but I want to say this that this influence will come into the church and it will have an effect upon all of us and we need to be aware of it now let me give you an example Babylonian garments would be anything that is the fashion of the world immoral unclean or something that is not conducive to a Christian Life and if you wear that it's a defiant Spirit listen to me it is a defiant Spirit you say it doesn't really matter high heel shoes okay for you to wear high heel shoes and I hope nobody's wearing high heel shoes this morning you know I I do I'm not preaching at people I'm preaching at a spirit it's a spirit of Babylon and for you to wear those it's a spirit of defiance I don't care what the word says or what the prophet of the hour says I'm going to do my own thing God help us that we don't have ones within the church that over and over you preach the word of God and yet they like to go to the edge God help us 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1-4 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means let man no man deceive you by any means go ahead for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that that day shall not come except there be a falling away first a falling falling away from what from the truth go ahead and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped as that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God isn't this exactly what the scriptures said that in Isaiah how oh Lucifer son of the morning how thou Hast lifted thyself up wanting to be worshiped as God taking away from what God's word is this is our absolute this is this is our Plum Line This is where if we need an answer on anything it's here so if anyone adds to and takes away from the word of God the Bible says that let their name be stricken from The Book of Life and the plagues found upon them that would do that so we see that this one is so deceptive but the Bible says that the man of sin would be revealed the son of predition because he opposes everything that is called God or wants to be raised above God and he wants to be worshiped do you realize that everyone out there is worship shipping a God in their football stadiums basketball Arenas in their rock and roll Arenas everywhere they have their gods they have their movie star gods they have their gods of all kinds of things everyone wants to be worship everybody wants to be on Facebook Instagram It's All About Me look at me this is me this is what I do look at what I can do so opposite of the things of God himself for there was no Beauty in him that we should desire him there was nothing about his clothing that made him stand out in fact they once tried to take him to Stone him or to take him away and guess what he walked among the crowd and they couldn't find him oh yeah that guy in a real fancy suit with a real uh hat you know and the the no that there was no Beauty in him my brother my sister we see how this Babylon is penetrating right on down into the Realms of this very hour in which we live you can see it in the media in our newspapers and in our televisions and we're going to see throughout the course of this sermon how the God of this world have has turned them over to a reprobate mind that they would believe a lie and what be damned all right brother Mark 2 Corinthians chapter 6 sorry 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verses 14- 18 Allelujah it helps if I get second Corinthians not first yeah second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14- 18 be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness now wait a second here the Bible says be not unequally yolked with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness go it for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with bile or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty do you understand he's saying what what what agreement do you have with the Devil or unbelievers or infidels what do you have in common is there anything who you hang around with shows me your Revelation you hang around those of the world who act like the world talk like the world live like the world the love of God is not even in them come on now help me preach this morning I don't want you to sit there and be silent I want you to be able to say Amen to the word of God Amen because we're in a very dark hour and darkness is covering the people gross Darkness they don't know what gender they are they don't know their position thank God that we have brothers and sisters and men and women in this hour who know where they come from where they're going they know their gender they know their position Hallelujah the others have got such a reprobate mind they don't know amen I'm titling my sermon this morning the Hidden Mysteries revealed under the Seven Seals the Hidden Mysteries these are Mysteries that were not open until this hour others probed at it others preached about it but it was the seventh angel amen amen who was given the revelation of the Seven Seals and I saw a white horse and a man riding on upon it and a he had in his hand a bow with no arrows and he went righty I want you to understand these are symbols but what was it it's a spirit and it went righty do you realize my brother my sister that we are we are living in the darkest most deceiving power that has ever been upon the face of the Earth the Hidden Mysteries revealed under the Seven Seals I'd like to take a subject of showing a parallel between the mystery of Christ because we got Mysteries we got a mystery woman we've got a mystery of a woman who's coming to power she is amen who is it it's the bride of Christ she's coming into her position but also there's another one rising up that's going to fight her you have the mystery of Christ and you have the mystery of Babylon and I want you to understand that these two kingdoms are in Conflict it is the greatest battle ever being fought right now that's right and you are in the midst of this great conflict the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of the devil watch these two Vines the prophet said that started there in Genesis Cain Abel Esau and Jacob Jesus and Judas and here we are in this 2024 and we have another day like in under the time of Babylon did you know that Saddam Hussein did you know that he told everybody and was not silent about it that he believed he had the spirit or The Reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar do you realize Osama Bin Laden said I want to destroy Israel and anyone that supports them why did we have the 911 attack because of our support to Israel and this Hamas and PLO an anti-Semitism that is happening in the world today right now upon our college campuses they are allowing them to to teach our college students how to go ahead and how to uh uh reject and go against and fight anyone who claims to be a Jew my from Palestine into the sea they do not want to live peaceably these are the sons of ishmail against Isaac yes they are the Seed of Abraham that's true through Hagar and if you know your Bible ishmail hated Isaac he made fun of him my in the sermon God identifying himself by his characteristics the spirit of God can be identified by its characteristics see the spirit of God and the spirit of the church there's a church Spirit and the spirit of God that's absolutely not like the church Spirit at all amen there's a denominational spirit and there's a national spirit and he goes on I want you to understand I'm not talking about a just having a church or religious spirit anyone can do that anyone can change their Church they can change their Doctrine they can change the way they live but it takes God to change a heart I'm talking about a relationship with Jesus Christ that makes you a 21st century disciple that you live and act like he did the world is headed for the battle of Armageddon before that happens the bride will be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air in fact I will tell you she is right now being caught up amen and we which are alive or remain shall be caught up I tell you what in 1971 when I heard heard the voice of the prophet of God I was caught up the word is harpazo it means captured by force Hallelujah I intercepted something there was something that got a hold of me that changed my life amen amen I'm not talking about religion it's religious people that crucify the word of God in every generation it was the religious ones who crucified Christ it was not the sinner the world is headed for Armageddon there is an image of the Beast that is going to become incarnate in a man called the Antichrist count the number for it's the number of a man 6003 score and6 where are you going to find answers to these questions who is this what is this Beast what is the image to the Beast what is the mark of the beast what is all these things that's happening that is supposed to take place before Jesus Christ comes it's happening to to the world right now and I wish to substantiate that this morning there will be a time of three and a half years of tribulation after the Rapture Gentile dispensation will close then you'll have the Rapture of that Gentile bride Hallelujah and this at the time of the Rapture will fulfill the ending of the Gentile dispensation in the last three and A2 years of the 70th week of the prophecy of Daniel will be fulfilled what is it going to be three and a half years of tribulation you think things are bad now you just wait until that blood that thin layer of blood that covers the earth which is a representation of the Blood Bought Blood Washed bride who is here because judgment will not strike the Earth until the bride is gone and when she's gone all hell is going to break loose the pill horse rider will begin to ride and when he begins to ride death and hell will follow him the people will there'll be things happening here on this Earth let me tell you that the people will cry and for the mountains and the rocks to fall on them oh let me tell you it's time now to get serious with God it is time now to find out how you're living before God if you got Babylon in you or you got Babylonian influence on you it's time to repent clean your house Hallelujah L the death angel find you brother Bram said in Lan in church age when the Ancients called laa the Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we're Now setting up that's what the world is going about yeah have you heard of the great reset oh it's all through the news that world leaders from around the world every continent have gotten together and said we want to do a great reset they want to change currency they don't mind some of these viruses that wipe out millions of people because you know what there's too many my brother my sister there's only one vaccine you need that's called the Holy Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you will be susceptible to every kind of disease every kind of ism every kind of thing that is coming after [Music] Humanity thank God for the Holy Ghost it's setting it up One World Government we think of that City being the location of a great church Council then he looks at the type and Shadow we see the for shadow of the ecumenical move taking place today where and very soon we will see the so-called watch this now socalled Christians come together indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the Terrors are being bound and the wheat will soon be ready for the Garner hallelujah amen the wheat is having all the greenness taken out of her she's becoming a mature bride yeah thank God that God has sent to us a prophet that exposed Satan and his plan for the end time the bride will not be deceived but the rest of the world will [Music] be second Corinthians 4: 3-4 but if our gospel be hid here's your Bible if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them look at that they make fun of you because you believe in God they make fun of you because they you take a stand for what you believe in they make fun of you they persecute you it's a spirit on them just like a spirit's on you hallelujah it's a holy spirit amen and without the Holy Spirit you are susceptible huh you talk about get vaccinated huh I don't believe in all of this medical vaccination oh you got how many of you got your Co shot how many you got your Co two shot you got your flu shot how about your Cold Shot how about this shot I'll tell you what you need you need to a real move of the holy spirit in your life it'll vaccinate you from all of this other nonsense I'm not saying you're never going to get a cold you're never going to get sick no you know what just about the time you get healed from one thing here comes something else just about the time you get over this you get something else well I'll tell you what this whole body is susceptible why it is a byproduct of sin but the Holy Spirit Hallelujah is changing you from this mortality to immortality that's why you be changed in a moment you won't you won't take this body with you when you go to meet him you be changed in a moment why God's not going to let sin come into His presence because this first body that you have is born in sin shaped in iniquity coming into the world speaking lies hallelujah it's wrong to begin with but the new birth corrects it all when you've been born again Hallelujah you are filled with his Spirit Hallelujah and then you walk like he walk you talk like he talk yes sir Hallelujah if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost and the God yes a God the God of this world who is it the same one who took Jesus and tempted him he said I own all the kingdoms of this world take yourself and bow unto me and I'll give you these Powers Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world Hallelujah you are not a citizen of this Kingdom you are not you your birth identifies where you come from you came from God and you're going back to God yes I believe that now watch this Revelation chapter 13 now America the prophet of God said I'm going to identify where America the United States is identified in scripture and you all know we were founded with 133 colonies 13 stripes 13 this 13 13 13 she's found in Revelations chap 13 and here she came with it looked like a lamb with two horns you all know I'm not going to go into those scriptures but let's just catch this up now here in Revelations 13 verses 4 through n and they worshiped the dragon which had gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months how long is that three and a half years look at this and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blashe to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and him and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him here hallelujah and we're talking about worship you know Jesus said many will come unto me in that day did not we do this did not we cast out Devils signs wonders did not Jesus does not deny they did them but he says depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you in vain do you worship me now could it be that this Babylonian system has permeated right down into the whole christiandom and got everybody all worshiping and really it doesn't matter the life you live you can smoke a little drink a little you can this that it's okay God loves everybody then I ask you why does God put those things in his Bible amen amen talking about worshiping how can you worship with others that don't have the same Revelation you have all right I want to ask you are you worshiping the same God they get there and they worship and yeah are they worshiping yes Jesus does not deny they worshiping amen right now throughout America and all over the world December because it's the time of Christmas we'll have a Mass for Christ we'll call it Christ mass and we'll get everybody we'll believe in St Nicholas and have Rudolph The Rednosed Reindeer and we'll do all this kind of stuff and we'll mix all kinds of pagan idolatry right in with Christianity and they won't even know it oh just put him to sleep a little bit I just change a little bit this and then until pretty soon the whole thing is permeated with idolatry worship Jesus said in vain do they worship me what right does a Believer have in worshiping with an unbeliever you say it really doesn't matter I want to ask you what part of the harlet system do you want to have a part with ah you can get mad at me all you want you can be upset it's amazing people will go to a what they call a Christian concert and won't walk across the street for a Revival yeah I got quotes on that too if you want me I'll show you it's what he said God help us huh amen worship in vain do they wor our worship is different why because Jesus said if you worship the father you must worship Him in spirit and Truth somebody say truth TR so there's a lot of people worshiping in spirit oh come let us adore him Orland night oh oh little town of Bethlehem or drum drum drum beat my little drum all this kind of stuff you know Satan doesn't care if you keep God 2,000 years ago Away in a Manger yes the little Christ and the people the angels and all this and we'll put camels and every everybody loves to go to a pageantry huh come on man they got a Christmas thing over here and the largest church in Phoenix and they got camels and cows and sheep and everything and let's go be entertained people want to be entertained God help us I'm I I'm not against it I've gone to it when I got done I wasn't any closer to God than when I went in fact I thought look at all the money they spent I I I just say this one time there was a guy and they had an angel come you know it was Michael the Archangel or somebody coming on a Highwire coming over the people and here he come in and here comes the angel and he got about halfway and the the the cable got stuck and then he starts spinning and he's got a microphone on him and he starts turning the air blue man he's cussing listen I'm not against those sa in this sense in this sense other than the fact I know that my worship is different I know my worship is because of the Revelation I have within my heart and because of the life that I [Music] live because my life is not a religion it's a relationship and therefore there can be all kinds of people with their cut hair and their makeup and their immoral clothing and you know what they just are like Cain who says I'm going to offer what I want to offer and if God doesn't like it and then when his offering was not received what did he do he got mad with God how many people today religious people well God take it or or or leave it right God help us to have a heart that is pure before God and a life that's living Justified and Sanctified and then filled with the holy spirit amen John 4 verse 21 and 20 through 24 Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when they shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth am I'm not saying others are not worshiping they are but not in truth they don't even know as Jesus said you know not who you worship but we know who we worship am they have a religions that's not based on a life Justified and Sanctified they worship a god of compromise in Creeds and dogmas it's true many of them I've heard denominational preachers say this well we'll just now that you've come for your Christmas service we'll say we'll see you at Easter I wasn't raised in a Christian home I wasn't raised there was not a Bible in our home Jesus Christ was a cuss word my father being a professional jockey and my mother wanted to be a star in Hollywood so I wasn't raised in a Christian home we celebrated like everybody else we had the tree we had the all of this and we'd wake up I remember waking up uh early Christmas morning Mom my father would go to the racetrack cuz he's got a Gallop horses in the morning uh he left for the racetrack at at 4:00 every morning well we tried to because we left out cookies and and stuff and milk for Santa Claus and you know we were hoping that we'd been good enough that we'd get a few gifts you know well anyway we'd wake up early morning get guess what the milk was drunk in the cookies there was even a cookie that had a bite out of it that was left I took the cookie Santa Claus this is proof right here he's alive Santa Claus is alive he was here don't don't tell me it wasn't H we did everything like everybody else until one day my friend Mitch Buckingham said why don't you come to a Bible study a what a Bible study what do you want to study the Bible Well you know you should read it it's God's word yeah well don't you want to be a Christian I said everybody's a Christian everybody in America we're all America is a Christian Nation you know I haven't killed anybody I'm a Christian I try to live by yeah will never forget saints of God the first time ever reading a Bible oh and sitting on the floor we didn't have chairs all the young people and we had a pastor his name was Hollis Allen and God bless his heart he loved God with all his heart and he passed out Bibles they gave me a Bible and and and and told us where to read in the Bible well I don't know acts Corinthians Thessalonians I didn't know where so somebody had to find the place in the Bible and then they said all of you can you can take a spot and you can read the Bible it'll be your turn you read a couple verses and yeah okay I can read yeah so I remember somebody sitting next to me and they read and so now was my turn so I began to read and as I read something things somebody goes they rudely interrupted me they said hallelujah praise the Lord and I thought what did I read that got him excited and why did he rudely interrupt me why didn't you do it to somebody else and then somebody else said yeah that's strong meat I thought what are you talking about so I began to read a little little more and somebody else said amen hallelujah isn't that wonderful and brother Sergio it made me feel so bad because I didn't see it I didn't see it they're all excited they're they're saying hallelujah on what brother Abel tell me on what what why do you say Amen to that for what reason why do you get excited why why do people sometimes while the ministers preaching somebody said Amen brother preach that that's the truth why I'll tell you why it's called representation of the seed inside of you amen because my words that I speak Jesus said are what they are spirit and life so when the word of God is spoken to you not in a Creed not in a Dogma but right there from the Bible when you read it don't try to interpret it say what he said it'll change your life it did mine amen I will remember that when I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus I I didn't know what I was doing Ezra I got so excited I got so excited I went outside the power lines are 30 40 feet in the air going down the driveway along the road and we were shouting and jumping I said I feel like I could reach up and touch those power I just felt so free because Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free nothing else religion won't do it truth will do it and when you hear the truth amen then when I came to this message the whole Enlightenment of the whole Bible my Bible became a new Bible I knew that he was not three Gods it wasn't father son Holy Ghost it was Lord Jesus Christ I found out there's one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus I found out the way of true water baptism wasn't Father Son and Holy Ghost no one in the Bible ever baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost how are they baptized Acts 2:38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what is the name of the father is Father a name is son a name is Holy Ghost the name no what is the name there's one name given among men whereby we must be saved Lord Jesus Christ so Peter on the day of Pentecost you who have taken this one called Jesus the Christ and have crucified him the same one God hath raised him up and made him Lord and Christ but his name was Jesus what was it Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah in in the sermon the first seal let's bring it down because we got to come into the seal part of this because these were mystery truths mystery truths where do you hear the mystery truths being preached outside of this message where do you hear the white horse rider the black horse the red horse the pale horse rider where do you hear about the vials and the seals and the Seven Thunders where do you hear it brother Bram said now notice nicolaia the Antichrist teaching that started in the days of Paul against God's word Antichrist then he's called again the false prophet which when the teaching become a man he was a prophet to the teaching of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church the pope was the prophet to the false word and that made him a false false prophet then he said third stage of Beast the man that was crowned in the last days and every Power of pagan Rome ever had because the seven-headed beast dragon was cast out of heaven and come incarnate in a false prophet here it is seven crowns he had cast out throw down to the Earth and see what are we saying who is this Rider this horse rider you know what it it is it's Satan's Superman Satan's Superman next quote the first seal notice this writer is nothing than but Satan's Superman uh incarnate Devil he's an educated genius we've been wanting a Superman we got it all right the whole world's wanting a Superman they're going to get it you just wait till the church goes up don't think Trump is our Superman you know what he's not even a politician he's just a businessman and I'm not here to talk politics or anything else but listen Trump ain't going to make America great again no no America's done for America's on her way down why just like all of the kingdoms before us whether it was Rome huh all these great powers where are they today you have to dig 20 30 feet down to find the roads they walked on when the church goes up Satan's cast out he'll go incarnate again paragraph 374 this is Satan's Superman with Ed education with wisdom with church Theology of his own word of his own making and he rides his white denominational horse to deceive the people there ain't one thing left everything's denominational stuck right into it in the Federation of churches and what's back and get Rome the Pope's now crying we're all one let's come together and walk together I don't know if any of you saw that Pope had a meeting with all of the head religions of the world here about a year and a half ago the religions of the world every facet of religion from Muslim it didn't matter and they all got together and he said actually we're one do you see the deception that's coming thank God we've had a message that has made us aware of these things the opening of the seals revealed to us the revelation of the horse riders down Through the Ages because a horse represents power watch this now for seal a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics it's National Powers it's religious Powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a pale a mixed Pale Horse he's got all kinds of powers amen the woman that is called mystery Babylon we could call her by her name Jezebel is coming into a power it's happening right now don't don't underestimate the power of this demonic system it's happening it's trying to permeate into our schools our governments our churches and even our pulpits God help us sir that we preach the revealed word of this hour which is the standard that God is raising up why there's two churches there's two women two Powers the mystery of Christ in his bride a church rising up we talk about a woke generation look at this woke generation with their multicolored hair their tattoos and well they look like their father Jesus said you will do the works of your father you'll look like him you'll do do like him and it's getting weird but there's another generation that heard the seventh angel about the Midnight Hour and guess what both wise and foolish woke up behold the bridegroom coming so we have also our woke generation thank God when you listen to the teams and you hear this Prophet you know what he's doing he's waking you up amen now brother James preached a tremendous service this past Wednesday I enjoyed that but with all of your wisdom that you're getting get understanding so we're going to look at one more scripture here I'd like brother Mark if you would we're going to go to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verses 1-14 1 Corinthians 2 veres 1-14 you guys bear with me now for just a few more minutes yeah 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one if you would brother Mark and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God you see the difference not with enticing words of man's Wisdom Paul is giving you an example hey I come to use hear in weakness and fear and trembling Paul the first church age messenger wow look at that go ahead how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory hidden wisdom something that is hidden in Scripture that though others read it they don't see it for the parable is there are many that have eyes to see but they see not they have ears to hear but they hear not Jesus why do you always speak to us in Parables he he said because unto them them it's not given now I want to ask you is that fair I thought God loved everybody and he's going to save everybody for God so loved the world and he would that no man perish is it fair that God would Open the Eyes of one and not the other I just plead this case to you has not the part power over the clay to make either the vessel of honor and another Of Dishonor it wasn't anything you did it was because you had representation he said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow now th those out there they're going to follow anything anybody everybody and just go along in fact that's what Babylon means confusion they're so confused like and I've said it before but pardon me for reiterating it there was a quite a famous black preacher that was preaching here a couple months ago and somebody sent me the clip and it's quite classic and he says and today people don't know whether they're a man or a woman he says I'll tell you what a woman is you want to know what a woman is your mama he said that's right your mama oh they they cannot Define a woman there was one though that could he says who can find a virtuous woman whose price is far above rubies and Pearls who had the ability to look out among all of those and see a woman that had virtue before cleansing listen to that who had virtue before cleansing the woman at the well had virtue before cleansing do you see God was looking at each one of you and before you heard truth you were out here just like myself out there going to be a marine biologist I'm going to be a surfer and I'm going to surf on all the different South Pacific Islands and my kids are going to be raised up up on the beach and H all this kind of stuff and I'm just bbing along in life thinking yeah this is what I'm going to do and all of a sudden somebody tells me oh come see you man my put on a tape good evening friends I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ Christ that voice let me tell you something that I I've never said before when I heard that voice I said I know that voice I said I've heard it before what was it there was a deep calling to the deep and there was a deep inside of me responding to that deep that's why with with all of you and with my children I have heard something that is so far beyond the natural It's Supernatural and I've heard it and my eyes became open to it I used to go to my I work because I worked at a surfboard shop what kind of clothes do you wear at a surfboard shop swimming trunks a surfboard T-shirt with the decal on it and flip-flops that was our dress attire so when I get converted guess what M I go to work the next day I get converted and I'm in long pants what happened to you this is a surfboard shop why are you in pants well I I I'm not going to come in shorts and swimming trunks anymore oh yeah somebody going to lust after your body see they don't understand huh I had one of the friends that I worked with at the surfboard shop was a Christian Charismatic Christian and he said Ron he says I've heard a little bit about what you kind of believe right now and I want to tell you it's not the truth I said oh wow really I said you're a Christian I'll tell you will you listen to a tape and will you you write down everywhere that he's wrong and so I said here will you listen to the tape you know what he did no no no there's an anointing on that tape just ask a devil he said there's an anointing on the tape I said yes sir there is I said but you said that you said he was wrong I said and I said do you have the Holy Ghost he said yes sir I do and I said those that have the Holy Ghost cannot be deceived so I said then but he said no no now the end of the story is I met him years later years later divorced his life in a ruin and I I met him actually out there on the coast of California I stopped by where I was that where I was raised up at and I met him and you know what he said he says Ron I have prayed for the day I could make it right to you I'm sorry what I said see when you come against God's word you're not coming against just the prophet touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm if you don't understand it you don't believe it keep your mouth off it CU per Adventure sometime down the road and your eyes come open to it did we finish reading that where did we finish seven go ahead verse 8-4 musicians go ahead and come I'm going to just have a couple more scriptures and we're going to close which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written iath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit amen for the SP for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God for what knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom te not in The Words which men's wisdom speaketh but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned the Bible also says for the word of God is to them that perish [Music] foolishness my first youth group here at evening Light Fellowship does anybody remember the name of our first first youth group we had our put it on our on our t-shirts anybody remember fools for Christ because remember brother R said I saw a man going down the street in LA and the placard said I'm a fool for Christ everybody laughing at him as he's walking down the street till they read what was on the backside he said who fool are you I'd rather be a fool for Christ than a Fool For The Devil Colossians 2 veres 1-3 for I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you and for them and laiaa for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might might be comforted being knit together in love unto all Riches of the fullness of understanding full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge Christ is the mystery of God revealed it was Christ in [Music] David it was Christ in Jeremiah it was Christ in all of those Old Testament types it was Christ in them what is Christ Christ and an anointing and they played their part when the anointing came on them David played his part David slew Goliath why because it was Christ in him you come against me with spear and sword but I come against you the god of Israel Jesus Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Ram said who was that MDC that came down to reveal himself to Abraham who said there was no beginning of days nor ending of Life who was it that joined himself to Abraham he said watch this CU here Abraham went back into that unknown realm and stepped out into another realm and we called him Jesus Christ who is the mystery of God revealed 1 Corinthians 4:1 says let a man so account of us as the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God stewards of the mysteries of God what's a steward somebody that watches over something Colossians 1: 25- 29 whereof I am a made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given me to you for you to fulfill the word of God even the
