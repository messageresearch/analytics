[41:07] praise as you all know that could read
[41:09] very different sir absolutely I believe
[41:13] that God is our healer and many times we
[41:16] have the symptoms we have and everybody
[41:19] goes to pray in

[42:12] sister Caitlyn look at these big smiles
[42:15] huh
[42:17] yeah you got two beautiful little

[42:24] responsibility it is is and they said
[42:27] brother Ron um please keep it short and
[42:30] sweet uh for the dedication you know and
[42:33] so we'll do that and the scripture says
[42:37] in Luke 18:1 15 and they brought unto
[42:40] him also infants that he would touch
[42:43] them but when his disciples saw it they
[42:45] rebuked them but Jesus called them unto
[42:48] him and said suffer little children to
[42:50] come unto me and forbid them not for of
[42:53] such is the kingdom of God verily I say
[42:55] unto you whosoever shall not receive the
[42:58] kingdom of God as a little child shall
[43:01] in no wise enter
[43:04] therein amen they have their little son
[43:08] Jude uh Andrew Jude actually means
[43:12] praised and Andrew means manly or
[43:16] Brave so I believe saints of God it's
[43:19] extremely important as our Prophet told
[43:22] us and reminded us so often name your
[43:25] children
[43:26] names of character amen something that
[43:30] will help guide them that will give them
[43:33] a direction in their
[43:35] life and I pray that he'll be one that
[43:38] will be praised in this end time that
[43:40] not only will he be prais but he will
[43:42] praise His Goden amen and I pray that he
[43:46] may be manly and brave and may he be
[43:49] raised up to be a a mighty Gentile
[43:53] Warrior standing against the while is
[43:56] the enemy in this end time age that we
[44:00] are
[44:01] in amen so I'll take this little
[44:06] one short and
[44:09] sweet I'll rock him just like you but
[44:13] there ain't nobody like Mama let's bow
[44:16] our heads heavenly
[44:18] father as I hold in my arms this little
[44:22] love gift that you have given to Andrew
[44:25] and Caitlyn
[44:26] and father we know that you do all
[44:28] things wonderfully and you're a giver of
[44:31] every good gift I pray now for Jude
[44:34] Andrew I pray that you will watch over
[44:36] him may he be a child that be praised by
[44:40] his parents but most of all be praised
[44:42] by his God and I pray that may he be
[44:46] manly and brave in all the Commandments
[44:49] that he has been given and may he be one
[44:51] of those father in this end time that is
[44:54] true to Thy word we bless him now in
[44:57] Jesus Christ's name
[45:00] amen was that short
[45:06] enough
[45:08] hey sometimes parents get a little
[45:10] nervous and say okay anyway we love you
[45:13] guys God bless you thank you so much
[45:19] amen we also have a a a baby
[45:22] announcement another eaglet has arrived
[45:25] to brother gin and Rebecca
[45:29] musango January 27th at 502 a.m. 94 o 22
[45:36] Ines and I'm not sure how you say that
[45:40] either Joel or goel how do you say it go
[45:44] goel yeah yeah who how many know who the
[45:48] goel is yeah that mediator so good
[45:52] praise the Lord amen what a beautiful
[45:55] baby
[45:56] huh yeah thank god let's give God praise
[45:59] for
[46:05] that amen praise the
[46:08] Lord amen I enjoyed the song
[46:12] specials now if you're spiritual you'll
[46:15] catch some connotation see what God does
[46:18] is he allows certain ones to become
[46:21] inspired to sing a song at a certain
[46:24] time and you'll find out that these
[46:27] songs are actually
[46:28] sermons because they are inspired by the
[46:33] holy spirit for this
[46:36] hour amen and I love that and so I
[46:39] appreciate it and thank all three of you
[46:42] three groups that that sang but that one
[46:45] that you are the people is actually
[46:48] speaking about a people walking in
[46:54] Prophecy and you know we we can look
[46:56] back at what God has done in the past
[46:59] and we can just look at it as
[47:02] historical but I don't want to look at
[47:05] it just as historical but as types and
[47:07] shadows amen and if we can see the types
[47:11] and shadows from what God has done as it
[47:14] was then so shall it be amen so then we
[47:17] can kind of know the direction for where
[47:20] we're
[47:21] going we can look from the time of
[47:24] Abraham how God that gave the promise
[47:27] until the time the the promise was
[47:30] actually
[47:31] manifested and after
[47:33] manifestation there's still trials
[47:36] there's still God testing Abraham that's
[47:39] right you all know and so you can go
[47:42] from Abraham you could go to the first
[47:44] Exodus you could see God with Moses and
[47:47] what's amazing is even Moses
[47:50] himself he got a little flustered with
[47:54] God I think sometimes we can do the same
[47:58] thing and he said
[48:02] wherefore hast thou not delivered thy
[48:06] people I've given them every time thus
[48:09] sayith the Lord and it got worse go
[48:13] figure how many times have you had God
[48:17] deal things with things in your
[48:21] life and God was doing Supernatural
[48:25] events all around you but things also
[48:28] got worse amen things always get worse
[48:32] before they get
[48:33] better but he said Lord why did you send
[48:38] me seeing thou has not delivered thy
[48:41] people well just hang
[48:43] on keep reading the
[48:46] story God is never too late he comes on
[48:49] the scene we as humans we get in our
[48:53] timeline and we think well uh uh Hey it
[48:57] should have happened by 77 yeah come on
[49:00] we saw that come and go should have been
[49:02] y
[49:04] 2K and here we are in 2024 and we're
[49:08] still going along well if 2024 doesn't
[49:12] fulfill the year of his coming then
[49:14] we'll be expecting
[49:17] 2025 so we don't put a uh uh a limit on
[49:22] God but we know that God is in control I
[49:25] had a bunch of questions sent to me I'm
[49:28] just going to read them very quickly I
[49:30] have got an awful lot you guys hang on
[49:33] cuz I'll have you uh we'll we'll sing a
[49:36] song here before we let you sit

[51:19] Dreadful day of the Lord can you think
[51:22] of any ways how Rebecca of the Old
[51:24] Testament
[51:25] is a type of the Bride of the New
[51:28] Testament is the many membered body of
[51:31] Christ being held like a hostage in the
[51:34] tunnel of their own human mind captured
[51:37] and lost in their human mind but never
[51:40] lost in God's

[56:50] brimstone from
[56:51] heaven and destroyed them all
[56:55] even thus shall it be in the day when
[56:58] the son of man is revealed watch the
[57:03] comparison when a Son of God moves into
[57:08] position then God fulfills his word and

[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:40] so I
[1:00:42] have and I just wanted
[1:00:45] to because there were some thoughts that
[1:00:47] this morning the Lord was dealing with
[1:00:49] me and now I just start writing them
[1:00:52] down and um brother Brenham says here
[1:00:56] Faith isn't something that's imaginary
[1:00:59] right I didn't give this to the Brethren
[1:01:02] so they don't need to look for it I want
[1:01:03] to get you uh I want to
[1:01:07] get a uh you to get it faith is a direct
[1:01:12] Revelation see if you only accept Christ
[1:01:16] as your savior by intellectual you
[1:01:19] haven't got it
[1:01:20] yet you cannot say that Jesus is the
[1:01:23] Christ until the the Holy Ghost has
[1:01:25] revealed it to you see intellectual
[1:01:28] Faith oh if I could only get that one
[1:01:31] point right now down so we could go home
[1:01:35] in every heart I'm thankful for this
[1:01:37] place position I'm I'm thankful for this
[1:01:41] place position right now so he's talking
[1:01:45] about something that's going to come to
[1:01:46] your heart direct Revelation what does
[1:01:48] it bring to you position and
[1:01:52] placing amen come on
[1:01:55] amen but if you can't understand how it
[1:01:59] that faith is not something mentally
[1:02:01] perceived but it's a revelation a
[1:02:03] revelation of God by faith not
[1:02:05] intellectual but by the
[1:02:08] heart amen
[1:02:10] God I want this message to go beyond the
[1:02:15] carnal intellect of human understanding
[1:02:19] and the only way it'll drop down from
[1:02:21] the Mind Into the Heart Is by the
[1:02:24] revelation of the Holy Spirit right amen
[1:02:28] most people miss the kingdom of God by
[1:02:30] about 12
[1:02:32] in they abort the seed germ of God in
[1:02:36] the womb of their mind even though it is
[1:02:38] a gerti
[1:02:41] seed it cannot pre pregnate the seed
[1:02:45] that is hidden in the heart until it
[1:02:48] goes past the human
[1:02:51] mind and goes then into the channel by
[1:02:54] faith fath
[1:02:56] right and comes in there and brother
[1:02:59] Bram said when it does he said that seed
[1:03:02] Gene excuse me the seed of life from the
[1:03:07] male comes down
[1:03:09] impregnates that seed Gene within the
[1:03:12] female he said it then takes
[1:03:16] life Hallelujah so now we
[1:03:20] understand these things but I I want to
[1:03:23] bring it down a little more home to us
[1:03:27] this
[1:03:28] morning and I was reading in 1
[1:03:32] Samuel about
[1:03:34] Abigail and the Bible says and Abigail
[1:03:37] was a woman of great
[1:03:40] understanding you see when we start
[1:03:42] taking these women in scriptures that
[1:03:44] are catching
[1:03:46] things yeah the promise given unto
[1:03:51] Abraham was manifested in Sarah
[1:03:55] yeah the promise was given to
[1:03:59] Abraham but Sarah does not come into the
[1:04:03] picture
[1:04:05] until God moves on Sarah and it says and
[1:04:09] Sarah receive strength to conceive
[1:04:12] seed until then she was an immature
[1:04:16] virgin woman there was nothing wrong
[1:04:19] with the Seed of
[1:04:20] Abraham all right it was gerti
[1:04:24] seed but the right seed in the wrong
[1:04:27] womb will bring forth an ishmail every
[1:04:31] time Ishmael was 15 years old when Isaac
[1:04:35] was
[1:04:36] weaned and he
[1:04:38] persecuted the C Gene of
[1:04:41] God
[1:04:43] Amen so you understand there's a
[1:04:46] maturing just like they were

[1:04:57] prophecy the bride has matured
[1:05:00] now she's no longer immature in her
[1:05:03] faith she was at one time cuz God is not
[1:05:07] going to marry an immature virgin
[1:05:13] amen like Sarah herself came into a
[1:05:17] perfect
[1:05:19] Faith see she had to find her position
[1:05:23] which was a place a
[1:05:25] condition before she could produce the
[1:05:28] promise amen
[1:05:30] amen she no longer passing off
[1:05:33] Supernatural visitation to another womb
[1:05:39] right Sarah by faith receives strength
[1:05:42] to conceive seed how many within the
[1:05:45] message I say for year and year after

[1:07:05] realm of the Supernatural and to catch
[1:07:07] the events of things happening in her
[1:07:10] life and blessed art thou Mary among all
[1:07:14] women now here is an angel she doesn't

[1:07:25] understand she was not
[1:07:27] quickened I want all of you to
[1:07:30] understand there is a time and a season
[1:07:32] for God's word to be quickened even as
[1:07:35] it was in Mary it's got to be
[1:07:38] confirmed
[1:07:40] conceived manifested in our life for it
[1:07:45] to come to
[1:07:46] pass so there is a time and a season how
[1:07:50] can this be not many days hence so
[1:07:53] there's a Time a chronology hang on hang
[1:07:56] on don't get don't get nervous
[1:07:59] Mary God's in

[1:08:56] Perfection right to go into the king's
[1:09:01] chamber because the king's
[1:09:05] chamber has that last and final step of
[1:09:09] perfection and remember even
[1:09:14] Esther does not have the king's scepter
[1:09:17] until she comes into the king's
[1:09:21] chamber so we understand we can see from

[1:10:20] expectation oh yeah I see a lot of
[1:10:22] little issues I see a lot of things in
[1:10:24] in my life and yes have faults and
[1:10:26] failures but that's okay I'm like
[1:10:29] Abraham thank you Lord the bride is
[1:10:32] predestinated now here we're going to
[1:10:34] jump into the sermon stay with me if you
[1:10:37] would bride is predestinated and
[1:10:41] ordained to catch the realm of the
[1:10:44] supernatural so I'm bringing you in you
[1:10:47] are the
[1:10:48] people she's designed to catch visions
[1:10:53] and to catch Supernatural
[1:10:55] instruction amen so brother brm said in
[1:10:59] the revelation of Jesus Christ he says
[1:11:03] I'm not going to read all the quote just
[1:11:04] the highlighted portion you can read the
[1:11:07] rest of it when you get home then I
[1:11:10] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:11:11] to give us Revelation or we fail to get
[1:11:15] it it's going to take the operation of
[1:11:18] the Holy Holy Ghost that means this book
[1:11:21] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:11:23] special class of
[1:11:26] people take one with prophetic
[1:11:30] Insight it will require the ability to
[1:11:33] hear from
[1:11:34] God it will require Supernatural
[1:11:39] instruction
[1:11:41] understand you were ordained
[1:11:44] predestinated of God to live in the
[1:11:48] realm of the
[1:11:50] supernatural
[1:11:52] Hallelujah this whole message is
[1:11:56] Supernatural and if you don't
[1:11:59] catch the picture within the picture all
[1:12:02] you do is see a
[1:12:04] man you see a prophet with a gift and he
[1:12:08] does a great ministry and all kinds of
[1:12:10] people came to him and
[1:12:13] flocked but if you fail to catch the
[1:12:16] picture or the voice behind the veil you
[1:12:20] miss it amen and you're just caught up
[1:12:23] in first in second poll but you're not
[1:12:25] going to go into the third poll that's
[1:12:28] right it takes Supernatural instruction
[1:12:31] acquired the the ability to hear from
[1:12:34] God but a mystery requires the teaching
[1:12:38] of the spirit or it never becomes clear
[1:12:42] I don't care how many tapes you listen
[1:12:43] to
[1:12:44] right you can listen and listen and go
[1:12:48] from 47 to
[1:12:50] 65 how we need to hear from God lay
[1:12:53] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:12:56] spirit to hear and to
[1:12:59] know why did God send this message is it
[1:13:02] just for you to wear a long dress and
[1:13:05] have long hair or do Church order
[1:13:07] there's oh if that's you know see
[1:13:10] unfortunately what happens is people
[1:13:12] tend to make it carnal and
[1:13:15] denominational IE it and and then we
[1:13:18] make a cookie cutter you're in the
[1:13:19] message if you got a long dress and long
[1:13:22] hair and this and and pretty soon
[1:13:24] without Revelation long hair and long
[1:13:27] dress goes out the
[1:13:31] window if it's ever revealed to
[1:13:34] you from the presence of God Holiness
[1:13:39] comes from
[1:13:41] within it's understanding what God wants
[1:13:45] done with his
[1:13:47] word amen all right so it isn't
[1:13:51] something that you get in in a seminary
[1:13:54] school you don't get it through
[1:13:55] comparing verse by
[1:13:58] verse it isn't something taught to you
[1:14:01] out of a School of
[1:14:02] Theology it is not something that you
[1:14:05] learn from man's
[1:14:07] teaching it isn't something that you
[1:14:10] catch from your pastor or even the
[1:14:12] prophet
[1:14:14] himself it must come from God and it is
[1:14:18] not
[1:14:19] understood in a carnal
[1:14:22] mind that's right but those who are
[1:14:27] predestinated have it already
[1:14:30] hardwired brother brandham said that you
[1:14:32] have a listening
[1:14:35] post and you have this ability to
[1:14:40] receive the signal that God is
[1:14:43] sending to him that hath an ear brother
[1:14:46] ram calls it the listening
[1:14:48] post he will hear what the spirit is
[1:14:51] saying to the church
[1:14:54] amen now it's not hearing a natural
[1:14:57] voice I'm might have to take off my
[1:15:00] jacket I'm going to
[1:15:04] work
[1:15:06] thank amen seed of God are predestinated
[1:15:10] to catch it amen they can't help it they
[1:15:14] can't explain it it just
[1:15:18] happens God used Luther and then he
[1:15:20] moved on God used Wesley and then he
[1:15:22] moved on
[1:15:24] God used pennyel then he moved on God
[1:15:26] used William brandom and then he moved
[1:15:28] on don't let that offend you it is that
[1:15:32] moving
[1:15:33] on that brings you into your position
[1:15:37] otherwise you just play tapes and you
[1:15:39] listen to what God has done and it
[1:15:43] doesn't have any effect on
[1:15:45] you and you're just waiting until I hear
[1:15:48] the next tape until I go to church the
[1:15:51] next service and somewhere the lights
[1:15:53] going to turn on well no once you get
[1:15:56] one of those aha
[1:15:57] moments when you catch it it's God
[1:16:01] revealing it to
[1:16:03] you amen and then you
[1:16:07] move the Bible says and Noah
[1:16:11] moved by fear because God gave him
[1:16:17] faith it says he was moved by
[1:16:21] faith you see that Hebrews 11 chapter I
[1:16:24] remember when I was just a first
[1:16:26] Christian and I was reading my Bible and
[1:16:28] I says the substance of faith faith is
[1:16:32] this and that and substance of things
[1:16:34] hoped for and evidence of Things Not
[1:16:36] Seen and by faith Abraham and by faith
[1:16:38] Noah by faith and I real real every
[1:16:41] sentence almost in the whole chapter by
[1:16:43] Faith by Faith by faith and so it is
[1:16:46] with you and I if it's not by faith what
[1:16:49] is faith God making himself known to you
[1:16:53] you not under Creeds and
[1:16:56] dogmas and things that we try to cause
[1:17:01] the church to conform I want you to be
[1:17:04] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:17:08] mind amen okay
[1:17:11] now watch God changing his mask can we
[1:17:15] understand that
[1:17:16] concept brother brandham said this is
[1:17:19] God's Great
[1:17:20] drama he starts in genes is he puts on a
[1:17:25] mask called
[1:17:27] Adam do we understand that we see God
[1:17:31] and Adam yeah enter chapter 2 scene two
[1:17:37] serpent comes in da da da da all this
[1:17:39] stuff and we watch God all the way down
[1:17:42] and it's the drama God in morpha God in
[1:17:47] Adam and then we began to see God in
[1:17:50] Seth we begin to see he was a replace
[1:17:53] for
[1:17:54] Abel and we begin to see God putting on
[1:17:58] a mask and down through all the
[1:18:00] scriptures we see it's God in his people
[1:18:04] God in
[1:18:06] morpa it's a holy spirit leading the
[1:18:10] church because it was the Christ of God
[1:18:16] right when Philip went and got
[1:18:19] Nathaniel's and said come and see we
[1:18:22] have found the Christ of God remember
[1:18:25] they had the scriptures they had the
[1:18:26] writing of Moses but they had never seen
[1:18:28] it become
[1:18:29] clear listen we had our
[1:18:32] Bibles we had theologians but we never
[1:18:36] saw God in scripture come to the
[1:18:40] realities here
[1:18:42] now until this
[1:18:46] message without this message you didn't
[1:18:49] know if he's one God or three Gods you
[1:18:52] didn't know how to baptized you didn't
[1:18:53] know nothing thank God he sent a
[1:18:57] prophet
[1:18:59] amen otherwise we all be fighting we
[1:19:01] have Seminary this and that we be
[1:19:04] fighting over a dip thong
[1:19:07] y am watch this now God changes his Mass
[1:19:11] the mystery
[1:19:13] continues the ministry
[1:19:17] continues and the voice
[1:19:19] continues God never changes when takes
[1:19:23] one man off the scene he may take that
[1:19:25] man off but he never takes his Spirit
[1:19:27] how many of you are aware that's the
[1:19:29] prophet's teaching so
[1:19:33] somewhere on this Earth there is
[1:19:36] somebody that is a voice representation
[1:19:40] of this message right now because
[1:19:42] Malachi 4 came he sounded his trumpet
[1:19:46] and guess what God took him
[1:19:48] home so now what do we do do we pray for
[1:19:51] God to return
[1:19:53] him in another Ministry cuz we failed to
[1:19:55] catch it the first
[1:19:57] time huh remember the angel said as John
[1:20:01] the Baptist was sent to forerun his
[1:20:03] first coming you and your ministry he
[1:20:05] said now here's type in Shadow right
[1:20:08] amen that's good when the graves of the
[1:20:11] Saints came
[1:20:12] open and John the Baptist came up with
[1:20:16] all of the resurrected saints that he
[1:20:18] have to say hey wait a second wait just
[1:20:20] a second let me preach another sermon to
[1:20:23] bring you into rapturing and and
[1:20:26] elevating
[1:20:28] Grace no John had already said
[1:20:32] Behold the Lamb of
[1:20:34] God so when his Earthly Ministry was
[1:20:37] over he didn't have a return Ministry
[1:20:39] it's not in the scripture it's not there
[1:20:42] in
[1:20:44] type but he will be because the prophet
[1:20:47] says in every age the messenger of that
[1:20:51] age will introduce
[1:20:53] that age to Christ right amen he said
[1:20:57] actually even every Pastor will stand
[1:21:00] with his
[1:21:03] congregation what a great
[1:21:05] responsibility the pastor have to look
[1:21:09] after their
[1:21:10] sheep true so the spirit and the bride
[1:21:14] are saying the same thing are we there I
[1:21:17] believe we've come to the time I'm not
[1:21:19] putting it off for some other and I'm
[1:21:23] not looking for another
[1:21:26] messenger I believe we have arrived
[1:21:29] because the spirit and the
[1:21:32] bride are saying the same thing amen now
[1:21:36] watch this a lot of you see in church
[1:21:38] age in the days of the seventh messenger
[1:21:41] in the days of Lan age its Messenger
[1:21:43] will reveal the mysteries of God as
[1:21:45] revealed to
[1:21:47] Paul he will speak out and those who
[1:21:49] receive that prophet in his own name
[1:21:51] will receive the beneficient effect of
[1:21:55] that prophet's Ministry and they shall
[1:21:58] hear and they that hear him will be
[1:22:01] blessed and become a part of the Bride
[1:22:03] of the last day who are mentioned in
[1:22:05] Revelations 22:17 somebody say I got it
[1:22:09] what is that the
[1:22:11] spirit and the bride they come so now
[1:22:14] he's taken those who's receive the
[1:22:17] prophet's
[1:22:18] Ministry they have now become prophecy
[1:22:22] we are the people
[1:22:25] okay so what he says from God the bride
[1:22:29] will say the spirit and the prophet and
[1:22:33] the bride will be saying the same
[1:22:36] thing and what they will say will have
[1:22:39] already been said in the word remember
[1:22:42] they're not adding two well here's my
[1:22:44] interpretation here's what it is no God
[1:22:48] don't want nobody to add to and take
[1:22:50] away he wants you to say what's already
[1:22:53] been
[1:22:56] said they are saying it
[1:22:59] now what are they saying watch this now
[1:23:02] come out from among her now and be ye
[1:23:05] separate from who Jezebel religion
[1:23:11] denomination come out of this
[1:23:13] denominational nonsense come away from
[1:23:17] Mystery Babylon come away from Jezebel
[1:23:20] religion and come into the truth
[1:23:23] amen somebody say Amen am the cry has
[1:23:26] gone out the cry is going out how long
[1:23:31] will the voice cry we do not know but
[1:23:33] one thing we do know it won't be long
[1:23:34] for this
[1:23:36] is the last
[1:23:40] age Matthew 16: 1-4 the Pharisees also
[1:23:45] with the Sadducees came and tempting
[1:23:47] desired him that he would show them a
[1:23:50] sign from heaven
[1:23:53] he answered and said to them what when
[1:23:55] it is evening you say it will be fair
[1:23:57] weather the sky is
[1:23:59] red and in the morning it will be foul
[1:24:02] weather today for the sky is red and lry
[1:24:05] oh ye Hypocrites yeah ye can discern the
[1:24:10] face of the
[1:24:11] sky but you cannot discern the
[1:24:14] signs of the
[1:24:17] times a wicked and adulteration an
[1:24:21] adulterous generation
[1:24:23] seek a sign see Believers don't seek
[1:24:27] signs signs follow
[1:24:29] them I expect signs to follow I expect
[1:24:33] God to be doing wonderful miraculous
[1:24:35] things I expect I don't need to have a
[1:24:37] sign go before me and say okay this is
[1:24:40] Vindication of my
[1:24:41] Ministry
[1:24:43] now signs follow Believers is it
[1:24:46] possible God can give a supernatural

[1:25:47] billboard I don't have a singing
[1:25:50] Ministry my wife don't play play the
[1:25:58] piano I realize that so I look at this
[1:26:02] you have a fellowship of the mystery
[1:26:04] that's why we're here yes listen we're
[1:26:07] here because of the message I don't I
[1:26:09] don't need to take any glory to myself
[1:26:11] well praise God all these people are in
[1:26:13] the church this morning because of me
[1:26:16] you got to be kidding me no sir if
[1:26:19] there's anything that I have ever done
[1:26:22] or helped anybody or you've received
[1:26:25] anything from God it's because Ron got
[1:26:29] himself out of the
[1:26:30] way and God used

[1:26:37] a great pen I am I can write great
[1:26:40] Revelations of God you are silent buddy

[1:26:49] yeah Amen brother but you're a gift in
[1:26:52] my
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:55] hand
[1:26:58] Hallelujah God help us to be a
[1:27:03] vessel to be a
[1:27:05] scribe to be something wherein God can
[1:27:08] write his word on the tables of our
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:18] hearts verse 10 to the intent that now
[1:27:20] under the principalities powers in
[1:27:22] Heavenly places might be known by the
[1:27:26] church the manifold wisdom of God
[1:27:30] according to the Eternal purpose which
[1:27:34] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in
[1:27:36] whom we have boldness and access with
[1:27:41] confidence by the faith of
[1:27:45] him by the
[1:27:48] faith of
[1:27:51] him it's not even your faith the faith
[1:27:55] you got is a gift thank you
[1:27:58] Lord given to you by grace through faith
[1:28:03] huh lest any man should boast right even
[1:28:07] the Apostle Paul asked for this thorn in
[1:28:12] his flesh to be
[1:28:14] removed because you know what God was
[1:28:17] giving him abundance of Revelation man
[1:28:21] woo I tell you what I'm preaching things
[1:28:23] that them people don't even understand
[1:28:25] even the disciples say that Paul
[1:28:28] preaches things that I don't understand
[1:28:30] whether I was in the heaven I don't know
[1:28:32] whether I was in the body out I don't
[1:28:34] know right but he was preaching great
[1:28:39] Mysteries but Paul said it wasn't
[1:28:42] me
[1:28:45] him you understand
[1:28:48] now the identified Christ of every
[1:28:52] age made each believer to follow the
[1:28:55] leadership of the spirit they were
[1:28:58] anointed of the holy
[1:29:00] spirit that was leading
[1:29:03] them why did Abel offer a
[1:29:06] lamb he was led he was given a
[1:29:11] revelation Cain also worshiped he also
[1:29:16] made an altar and he brought of the
[1:29:19] beautiful fruits of the field which
[1:29:22] wrong Revelation because he takes the
[1:29:26] cursed
[1:29:28] fruits curs it be the
[1:29:31] ground remember God didn't curse
[1:29:34] Adam he's a Son of
[1:29:36] God God will never curse his own flesh
[1:29:40] that's right God cursed
[1:29:44] the god cursed the ground around
[1:29:49] adamen okay Earth because you have done
[1:29:52] this thistles and
[1:29:55] Briars oh let me tell you you think
[1:29:58] you've seen big avocados you ain't seen
[1:30:02] nothing till we get over there that's
[1:30:04] right one avocado will feed a
[1:30:08] family what I'm saying the
[1:30:10] fruits of the Earth are being held back
[1:30:14] because God cursed it but he's going to
[1:30:17] lift that curse pretty soon there's
[1:30:19] going to be a millennial rain huh
[1:30:22] there's Hallelujah there going to be a
[1:30:25] honeymoon and God is going to lift the
[1:30:29] curse Hallelujah okay hold another
[1:30:35] sermon Saul the
[1:30:37] Pharisee was blinded by
[1:30:41] religion he was under the greatest
[1:30:44] Theologian of his day
[1:30:50] Gia and so God had to Blind him to open
[1:30:54] his

[1:42:48] let me get understanding Lord if I ever
[1:42:52] preach a sermon that is effective to

[1:43:23] God anoints your
[1:43:26] understanding I want to ask you is God
[1:43:30] heart of
[1:43:33] hearing let me ask you in your prayer
[1:43:37] closet do you scream at
[1:43:40] God come on I'll tell you now I'm going
[1:43:43] to share with you a very intimate
[1:43:45] portion of my
[1:43:48] prayer when I need God and and I'm in my
[1:43:51] prayer
[1:43:53] closet I'm not screaming and
[1:43:56] yelling I'm on my face before God and
[1:43:59] sometimes I cannot even verbalize with
[1:44:03] my mouth and I groan
[1:44:15] oh and I'm
[1:44:18] broken and I don't know what
[1:44:21] say the Bible says your moanings and
[1:44:24] your
[1:44:25] groanings are understood by the spirit
[1:44:28] of
[1:44:29] God have you ever
[1:44:34] groaned God knows
[1:44:37] exactly why you're groaning and he
[1:44:43] understands my intimate prayer with God
[1:44:46] is
[1:44:49] silent the in
[1:44:51] the
[1:44:52] intimate revelation of
[1:44:57] God space of about a half
[1:45:02] hour of
[1:45:05] Silence I'm going to bring to
[1:45:08] you with the opening of The Seven
[1:45:14] Seals I'm going to give you
[1:45:19] words
[1:45:21] I'm going to reveal something to you
[1:45:23] that I don't even have to say out
[1:45:27] loud there are times when my wife and I
[1:45:32] become so
[1:45:33] one there are times when I want to say
[1:45:36] something and she's already got the
[1:45:40] Revelation and the older we
[1:45:43] get the more we think
[1:45:48] alike yeah
[1:45:51] we've become
[1:45:55] one because of a
[1:45:58] union do you understand
[1:46:03] amen God help me I'm on page
[1:46:10] four now watch
[1:46:12] this so when you come to church or
[1:46:15] coming here that you might perfect your
[1:46:17] walk in
[1:46:19] God lord show me the things I'm doing
[1:46:22] wrong not the things you're doing right

[1:46:27] ourselves by ourselves and we
[1:46:30] become really ignorant don't we well I'm
[1:46:35] better than at least three or four
[1:46:37] people at
[1:46:39] church we're looking down at others when
[1:46:42] you measure yourself to the Perfection
[1:46:44] of Christ how do you
[1:46:47] measure ah wish you wouldn't have said
[1:46:50] that
[1:46:52] cuz I'm a failure amen

[1:47:13] mistakes it wasn't that he didn't have
[1:47:15] faults and
[1:47:17] failures right but God gave him
[1:47:24] faith and it was

[1:49:19] that'll be
[1:49:20] 350 million Zim
[1:49:23] dollars whatever you got to be kidding
[1:49:26] so brother godman puts a
[1:49:30] box like that so when somebody said I'm
[1:49:33] going to give you million
[1:49:35] bucks ask him what kind of
[1:49:39] currency anyway I don't know why I said
[1:49:43] that but I
[1:49:47] did Ephesians 4
[1:49:51] verses 11 through1
[1:49:54] 13 and he gave some somebody say
[1:49:58] some Apostles
[1:50:01] and Prophets
[1:50:04] and evangelists and some pastors and
[1:50:07] teachers didn't give all of them he gave
[1:50:11] some I just part I just pray I'm one of
[1:50:13] the
[1:50:14] some he gave
[1:50:17] some for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:50:21] for the work of the ministry and for the
[1:50:23] edifying of the body of
[1:50:26] Christ till we come into the unity of
[1:50:29] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:50:32] Son of God unto
[1:50:35] a perfect man that's
[1:50:39] it and the measure of the
[1:50:42] stature of the fullness of
[1:50:45] Christ
[1:50:49] wow
[1:50:51] now brother Brenham says in the sermon
[1:50:53] perseverance I am not going to be able
[1:50:55] to get through all of my sermon today
[1:50:58] that's
[1:51:00] okay is that okay I know some of you are
[1:51:04] hungry I
[1:51:07] am my wife's got me on this intermittent
[1:51:11] fasting I don't like to fast when I'm
[1:51:15] hungry and the time can't go fast enough
[1:51:23] anyway okay perseverance 1962 I believe
[1:51:28] that there's a church coming into that
[1:51:31] Perfection amen that
[1:51:34] Ministry yeah of
[1:51:37] perfection a Ministry there is going to
[1:51:40] be a Ministry of perfection let's say
[1:51:44] Ministry of perfection Ministry of
[1:51:48] brother Ram said it yeah so I believe it
[1:51:51] where the offices were Apostles prophets
[1:51:53] teachers P for the perfecting of the
[1:51:56] church and pastors and teachers so forth
[1:51:58] we be so with the word until the whole
[1:52:00] thing will work right up onto the coming
[1:52:02] of the Lord I believe that I believe
[1:52:04] we're nearing that
[1:52:06] now wow if you said that in 62 what
[1:52:08] about
[1:52:14] 2024 God speak to my heart this
[1:52:18] morning and let me walk perfect before
[1:52:21] you let me be like
[1:52:24] Enoch who walked with God because before
[1:52:27] he had his translation amen he had this
[1:52:32] testimony that he pleased God because
[1:52:35] without
[1:52:36] faith it is
[1:52:38] impossible that's right to please
[1:52:43] him
[1:52:44] than First Kings 8:
[1:52:48] 61 let your heart therefore be perfect
[1:52:51] with the Lord Our God to walk in his
[1:52:54] statutes and to keep his
[1:52:57] Commandments as at that at this day you
[1:53:01] see when you are re you are united with
[1:53:04] the bridegroom everything that he is we
[1:53:08] become that's
[1:53:10] right amen when a woman is united in
[1:53:14] marriage to her
[1:53:16] groom there is no prenatural agreement
[1:53:24] if it is you better not marry that
[1:53:26] guy cuz the moment you do something
[1:53:29] wrong I'm taking my stuff and leaving
[1:53:32] you no
[1:53:35] prenup but when you are
[1:53:39] united with your groom guess
[1:53:42] what it is well known everything he
[1:53:46] got is part yours Hallelujah do you know
[1:53:50] Arizona is a community property state

[1:53:58] years as community property guess

[1:55:05] alike Philippians 3:15 let us therefore
[1:55:09] as many as be
[1:55:12] perfect be thus minded and if anything
[1:55:15] be and if anything be otherwise minded
[1:55:19] God will will reveal this even unto you
[1:55:23] amen our Perfection is not within our
[1:55:26] own ability somebody say I got
[1:55:30] it it's not you that's right it's him

[1:56:07] weep your way to the
[1:56:10] altar but I don't have that
[1:56:13] ability but what ability I do
[1:56:16] have is to take what God has always
[1:56:19] dealt with me
[1:56:22] with I got a little
[1:56:25] sling I'm not a mighty

[1:57:02] and he slung it towards Goliath and
[1:57:05] Goliath being a man of war he saw that
[1:57:07] thing coming and he said and he went
[1:57:09] right and he said and the thing started
[1:57:12] curving so he moves left and it curves
[1:57:15] to the left he said it was a guided
[1:57:18] missile

[1:57:27] him a little old David runs up there and
[1:57:30] he don't even have a sword he takes
[1:57:32] Goliath's own sword picks up the head
[1:57:34] and guess what guess what the
[1:57:36] Philistines
[1:57:39] did run for your
[1:57:41] lives
[1:57:43] right okay okay now
[1:57:48] look
[1:57:53] in a sermon Souls that are in prison
[1:57:56] now God reflected himself back in that
[1:58:00] and he became a man when he be became
[1:58:03] Jesus Christ excuse me Christ Jesus and
[1:58:05] he was God see God was in Christ see
[1:58:09] lived in him reconciling the world to
[1:58:11] himself through that perfect man each

[1:58:24] here and sing that song they don't get
[1:58:28] it each one of us

[1:58:33] accepted that
[1:58:37] becomes the Perfection of him amen thank
[1:58:40] you Lord oh
[1:58:44] wow you mean to tell me there was an
[1:58:48] exchange
[1:58:51] he became
[1:58:53] me that I might become him thank you
[1:59:02] Lord you
[1:59:05] mean he left the
[1:59:08] Splendor of
[1:59:10] Heaven to come
[1:59:13] down to take my
[1:59:15] place Praise You Lord when it was
[1:59:18] nothing
[1:59:19] but to be
[1:59:22] condemned for all have sinned and come
[1:59:25] short of the glory of
[1:59:27] God no man in Heaven Nor on
[1:59:31] Earth was worthy to take the
[1:59:37] book but the gift of God yeah is eternal
[1:59:42] life through Jesus Christ if you have
[1:59:45] never accepted Jesus Christ in your life
[1:59:49] you were on your way to hell that's
[1:59:52] right if you don't accept the pardon
[1:59:56] that he gave by being your substitute
[2:00:00] then you will pay for your
[2:00:05] sins
[2:00:08] amen I wouldn't be caught dead without
[2:00:10] Christ
[2:00:12] amen amen some of you missed
[2:00:18] that
[2:00:20] yeah you young
[2:00:24] people if you have missed the essence of
[2:00:27] the
[2:00:28] message perhaps it's because the
[2:00:31] ministry wasn't preaching the right kind
[2:00:33] of
[2:00:34] ministry they're bringing to you rules
[2:00:37] regulations and like a cookie cutter we
[2:00:40] you go ahead and long dress long hair
[2:00:43] this and that and then bless you you're
[2:00:46] a message
[2:00:47] believer and how many of of them
[2:00:51] were stamped message Believers for years
