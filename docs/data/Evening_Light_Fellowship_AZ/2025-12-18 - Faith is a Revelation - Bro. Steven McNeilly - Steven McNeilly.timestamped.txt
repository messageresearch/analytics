[0:31] with a melody. [singing and music]
[0:35] You surround me with [music]
[0:40] a song

[4:38] Bobby McGary, would you come tonight,
[4:39] Brother Bobby, and open our service in a
[4:42] word of prayer? Let's just [music] hand
[4:44] a prayer request before we came out from
[4:46] Sister Molly. It says, "My mom passed
[4:48] away early this morning.
[4:52] Thank you for your prayers during her
[4:54] illness." So, let's pray for the family.
[4:56] Pray for sister Molly, all the family
[4:58] members. Pray the Lord be their strength
[5:00] and their comfort at this time. How many
[5:02] would have a need tonight? You just want
[5:03] to lift your hand before the Lord. He's
[5:05] aware of each and every need. Amen.

[5:27] you, Lord.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the needs of the people,
[5:31] Lord.
[5:33] Lord, you're more than able to meet
[5:35] those needs.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; We thank you for what you've done in our
[5:39] lives, Lord, and what you're doing and
[5:41] what you're going to do.
[5:44] Father, would you heal the brokenhearted
[5:46] and give strength to the weak, Lord?
[5:50] Would you bless the service tonight?
[5:52] [music]
[5:54] &gt;&gt; May we receive what you have for us.
[5:57] Thank you for what you're done
[6:00] in our lives. Father, we love you and we

[6:48] And we're coming up on the Christmas
[6:50] season. The world celebrating the birth
[6:52] of a savior. And much as I appreciate
[6:54] that, I'm so thankful for the cross of
[6:57] Calvary tonight. And I wanted to sing at
[7:00] Calvary. Years I spent
[7:03] in sin and pride was there at Calvary
[7:06] the price was paid. Amen.

[12:02] many believe we serve an amazing,
[12:04] tremendous God tonight. When I'm in

[15:23] fails me.
[15:27] All my [music] days
[15:29] I've been held in your hand.
[15:34] From the moment that I wake up [music]
[15:39] till I lay my head,
[15:43] I [music] will sing of the goodness
[15:48] of love.
[15:53] And all my [singing and music] life you
[15:55] have been faithful.
[16:01] And all my life you have been so so
[16:06] good. [music]
[16:09] With every breath that I am [singing]
[16:12] able,
[16:15] I will sing
[16:18] of the goodness
[16:20] of God. [music]
[16:23] I love your voice.
[16:26] [music]
[16:28] You have led me through the fire.
[16:31] [music]
[16:33] In the darkest night,
[16:36] you are close [music and singing] like
[16:38] no other.
[16:41] I've known you as father.
[16:45] I've known you as a friend
[16:49] and I have lived
[16:51] in the goodness
[16:54] of God.
[16:59] And all my life you have been faithful.
[17:07] And all my life you have been so so
[17:12] good.
[17:14] With every breath [music] that [singing]
[17:16] I am able,
[17:21] I will sing
[17:23] of the new.
[17:30] Your [singing and music] goodness is
[17:31] running after running after me.
[17:38] Your [music and singing] goodness is
[17:39] running after running after me.
[17:45] With my life laid [singing] down, I
[17:47] surrender now. I give you everything.
[17:50] [music]
[17:54] Your [singing] goodness is running
[17:56] after, running after [music]
[17:59] me.
[18:04] Cuz all [singing and music] my life you
[18:06] have been faithful.
[18:12] And [singing and music] all my life you
[18:14] have been so so [singing and music]
[18:17] good.
[18:20] Every
[18:26] &gt;&gt; I will sing
[18:29] of the goodness
[18:32] of God. Give the Lord [music] a hand
[18:34] clap of praise this evening. [applause]
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the greatest
[18:42] thing about the faithfulness of God is?
[18:45] Is that he is faithful even when we are
[18:47] not faithful.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; That's why he made a promise and he said
[18:51] he could swear by no greater. So he
[18:52] swore by himself
[18:54] &gt;&gt; because he realized that man could not
[18:56] keep the covenants or promises of God
[18:59] that and so he said I swear by myself
[19:02] Abraham. It's not by your works but it's
[19:05] what I'm going to do for you. And so God
[19:08] this evening in his word is it's not
[19:10] what we can do for God, but it's what
[19:12] God has already done for us
[19:16] &gt;&gt; and we just need to accept the finished
[19:19] work of Calvary.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's pray this evening.
[19:23] Father God, Lord, we commit our lives
[19:26] into your hands
[19:29] &gt;&gt; because there's no other hands that we
[19:31] want to be in, Lord. That's right.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to lead ourselves
[19:35] and we don't want to be the pilot of our
[19:38] own ship. But Father, we ask that you
[19:41] would come and that you would take
[19:43] control of all of our lives, Lord. Take
[19:46] control of this service this evening,
[19:49] Lord. You know the thought that you've
[19:51] placed on my heart. And I pray, Father,
[19:53] that the thought would be extracted from
[19:56] my heart to your people's heart. Let it
[19:58] be, Lord. We pray that for every need,
[20:01] Lord, that was uh unspoken here this
[20:04] evening that you would meet it. And we
[20:06] ask that you'd be with Sister Molly and
[20:08] the family, Father, that you would
[20:10] comfort them at this time. Let all
[20:13] things be done for thy kingdom's glory
[20:15] in Jesus Christ's name.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We greet you this
[20:20] evening in the wonderful name of Jesus
[20:23] Christ. And uh it's always an honor and
[20:26] a privilege to come to the house of the
[20:28] Lord. If you have your Bible, turn with
[20:30] me to the book of Hebrews, chap 11.
[20:34] Thank you, musicians. And we'll read
[20:36] verse one. And then we'll go from
[20:38] Hebrews to Romans, chapter 1. We'll read
[20:42] verses 16 and 17.
[20:47] Allelujah. Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Very familiar portion of scripture for
[20:53] us here this evening. Hebrews chap 11
[20:57] and verse 1. It says, "Now faith is the
[21:00] substance of things hoped for, the
[21:03] evidence of things not seen." Brother
[21:07] Brandon would take that and he said it's
[21:09] the evidence of of things that is not
[21:12] seen, not felt, nor smelt, nor heard
[21:15] because it has nothing to do with our
[21:17] five senses. It's a spiritual six sense.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Six sense. Romans chapter 1
[21:27] vers 16 and 17.
[21:37] And it says, "For I am not ashamed of
[21:39] the gospel of Christ, for it is the
[21:42] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[21:45] that believeth, to the Jew first and
[21:48] also to the Greek. For therein is the
[21:51] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[21:54] to faith, as it is written, the just
[21:57] shall live by faith." Amen. You may be
[22:00] seated this evening.
[22:05] I would like to title my sermon this
[22:08] evening, faith is a revelation.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; And I think uh once in a while it's good
[22:15] for us as ministers to speak on faith
[22:18] because uh it's so easy for us for our
[22:23] uh faith to become we would say uh low
[22:28] or for our faith to become discouraged.
[22:31] And once in a while we need a a little
[22:34] injection of of faith put into our
[22:36] blood.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; And so I I I would like to speak on on
[22:42] faith and perhaps um take it from a
[22:45] little bit of a different angle this
[22:47] evening um regarding faith. And my title
[22:50] kind of gives it away of faith is a
[22:53] revelation.
[22:54] And we understand that faith without
[22:57] faith it is impossible to please God.
[23:00] And the reason that we are all here this
[23:02] evening is because we want to be
[23:04] pleasing unto the Lord.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; We want to figure out, you know, not
[23:08] just where we're we're doing good in
[23:11] life, but we want to see kind of uh what
[23:13] we need help with and we want to get a
[23:16] little bit of encouragement and whatever
[23:17] the Lord would have for us in our
[23:19] spiritual life. That's why we gather
[23:21] into the house of the Lord. It's not to
[23:24] just be seen or it's not to be heard or
[23:26] it's not to have fellowship one with
[23:29] another. Though those things are nice,
[23:31] but it's for us as as as the word here
[23:35] on earth to receive from the word from
[23:38] heaven.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; We want to receive from the word because
[23:42] whether we like it or not, we are
[23:45] becoming the word.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that because whenever
[23:50] you become the word, it it it it it is
[23:53] taking us into uh kind of uncharted
[23:56] waters, if I could say it like that.
[23:59] When we think about becoming the word of
[24:01] God, we we think about the great
[24:03] miracles of God and we think about great
[24:05] healings of God and so on and so forth.
[24:08] But when we become the word, we never
[24:10] think of of well, if somebody smites you
[24:13] on the cheek that you turn the other
[24:15] cheek. that if someone asks you to walk,
[24:18] you know, half a mile with them, that
[24:19] you walk a mile. Or if someone asks for
[24:22] your coat, you give them your cloak
[24:24] also. And we find out that these things
[24:27] are is is actually the word becoming
[24:30] flesh in this day. It is a life lived of
[24:34] the gospel. So whenever we think about
[24:36] it and we get all rejoicing over it um
[24:39] and and we think of the the great things
[24:41] of becoming the word a lot of times we
[24:44] forget of the simplicity of the word and
[24:47] the simplicity of becoming and living a
[24:49] Christian life.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing about it is this is
[24:55] that everything to do with the Christian
[24:57] life is contrary to who we are as carnal
[25:01] human beings.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:04] So anyways, enjoy becoming the word.
[25:09] So the reason why we're here this
[25:11] evening is because we want to do that
[25:14] which is pleasing to the Lord. And and
[25:16] before we can have faith because without
[25:19] faith it's impossible to please him.
[25:21] First of all, we need to recognize and
[25:24] understand exactly what faith is. Right.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard or or made the
[25:33] comment even yourself, uh, all I need to
[25:36] do is is have faith. All I need is is a
[25:40] little more faith. Uh, all I want is to
[25:43] have a little more faith. And if I had
[25:45] just a little bit more faith, I could do
[25:48] this. And if I had a little more faith
[25:50] in God, perhaps I would receive my
[25:52] healing, or perhaps I would be able to
[25:55] overcome this situation. and and we're
[25:58] talking about um and and we think about
[26:00] faith AND WE SAY, "WOW, ALL I need is is
[26:02] just that little bit more. And if I had
[26:04] a LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH, I COULD DO ALL
[26:06] THINGS. And if and if and if and it
[26:09] almost seems like faith is something
[26:11] that is just is is untouchable."
[26:14] that faith is something that that when
[26:16] you think you're getting to a place of
[26:18] faith that it just steps a little bit
[26:20] further and you never you never fully
[26:23] grasp it and you say all I all I need is
[26:26] a is a little bit more faith and I
[26:30] believe that and perhaps it's the
[26:32] ministry's fault that we have we have
[26:35] put place in such a a a position in such
[26:38] a place where you know if if life isn't
[26:41] going good well you don't have faith
[26:43] enough
[26:44] or if you haven't received a healing or
[26:46] you haven't received uh uh uh your sons
[26:49] or or your daughters into the kingdom of
[26:51] God is it's your fault AND IT'S BECAUSE
[26:53] YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH FAITH and and
[26:55] this is happening because your your
[26:57] faith is no good
[26:59] and I think we've we've preached faith
[27:02] and saying well all you need is faith
[27:03] and all well it's true all we need is
[27:07] faith but what is faith
[27:10] &gt;&gt; is faith an imagination
[27:14] Is faith some kind of uh uh myth? Is it
[27:18] some kind of thing that's that's that's
[27:20] not tangible? It can't be touched. It
[27:23] can't be felt. It uh what is faith
[27:26] exactly? Because if we have to attain
[27:29] faith to be pleasing to God, I want to
[27:31] know what is faith
[27:33] &gt;&gt; and I want to know how it is applied in
[27:36] my life. And I want to know how to be
[27:38] pleasing to God with my faith. Amen.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; But when faith is something that's
[27:46] magical, let me say it that way, when
[27:48] it's something that's uh perhaps a a a
[27:52] figment of our imagination, faith will
[27:55] never ever be tangible and it'll never
[27:59] be anything that we can fully grasp. But
[28:02] I want you to know that faith is real.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; That faith is tangible.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; That faith is solid. The Bible says it
[28:11] is a solid rock. It's a firm foundation.
[28:15] It's not something that's far off in the
[28:17] clouds that we have to do something
[28:19] magical to receive it. No. Faith is the
[28:22] simplicity of the gospel. Faith is a
[28:25] revelation.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; It's not something that's not within our
[28:32] grasp. And when we realize what faith
[28:35] really is, we can start living our life
[28:38] according to faith. and according to the
[28:41] word. Hallelujah.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; A lot of times when we when we when we
[28:50] don't receive what it is that we're that
[28:52] we're praying for or that we're trying
[28:55] to have faith for, and as time goes on,
[28:58] a lot of times our faith can uh it can
[29:01] drop. When our when our faith is
[29:03] something that that's in our imagination
[29:06] or the intellects of man, before you
[29:09] know it, you will give up on faith.
[29:13] When faith is not a revelation to you
[29:15] personally, you will give up on what it
[29:18] is that you're trying to have faith for.
[29:21] But when faith is a true revelation to
[29:25] you personally from God, it doesn't
[29:27] matter how long it takes for whatever it
[29:30] is to come to pass in your life, you'll
[29:32] still believe God and your faith will
[29:34] still be strong.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:38] And so our problem is this is that we
[29:41] are we are constantly trying to figure
[29:44] out what faith is or we have a
[29:47] misconception
[29:49] of what it actually is and what it
[29:52] actually is in our lives. And so before
[29:55] long we get discouraged.
[29:58] We pray and we try to have faith AND AND
[30:01] I'M TRYING SO HARD THIS WEEK to have
[30:04] faith for this. AND I'M TRYING SO HARD
[30:06] to have faith for that. And before long,
[30:09] when you're trying so hard to have the
[30:11] faith and it doesn't come to pass, we
[30:14] end up in this cycle of of depression
[30:17] and this this cycle of, well, perhaps
[30:20] it's not for me.
[30:23] Perhaps that is for somebody else. Or or
[30:25] or we get discouraged in our walk. And
[30:28] and it's really because we don't
[30:30] understand what faith is. We're trying
[30:34] to figure it out intellectually. We're
[30:37] trying to work our way into it. We're
[30:40] trying to pull oursel up to some level
[30:42] of of what we think where faith is. And
[30:45] we're actually missing what faith
[30:48] actually is.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; When I say faith is a revelation, you're
[30:53] all going to go, "Well, yeah, I
[30:55] understand that." But faith is a
[30:57] revelation.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:00] It is something that is given to you
[31:04] personally from God.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; And so when you think about revelation
[31:11] and you think about the word and the
[31:13] revelation of this hour, there's many
[31:15] things that is called that we could call
[31:18] revelation.
[31:20] I'll get into that after a little while
[31:23] because there's me there's many things
[31:25] that God has revealed to you personally
[31:28] and you're missing that that's actually
[31:31] faith
[31:32] &gt;&gt; because faith is a revelation
[31:39] &gt;&gt; and faith will hold you in your time of
[31:41] need.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:44] And so what happens is we when we're
[31:47] feeling when we're feeling good in God
[31:49] and we're feeling spiritual and and and
[31:51] and and and
[31:53] we're praying and we're reading our
[31:54] Bible so on and so forth, we say, "My my
[31:57] faith is so strong right now and and I'm
[31:59] feeling good and and I can cut off any
[32:01] devil's head and I can do this and I can
[32:03] do that and I can run through a troop
[32:05] and I can run over a a leap over a wall
[32:08] and I can do all things through Christ
[32:10] who strengthens me." And it's all to do
[32:13] with feelings. Understand? Faith has
[32:16] nothing to do with feelings.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; But faith is faith.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Faith is a six sense. It has nothing to
[32:22] do with how you feel. It has nothing to
[32:25] do what you can see, taste, feel, smell,
[32:28] or hear, but it has everything to do
[32:30] with the revelation of the word. Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; And so, so a lot of times what happens
[32:37] is we're feeling good and we're feeling
[32:39] strong and it's all to do with feelings
[32:42] and then when something goes wrong or we
[32:44] have a bad day, we say, "Wow,
[32:46] my faith is low. There's something
[32:49] wrong. I Yeah, I'm just not feeling it
[32:52] today. I my my faith is at an all-time
[32:55] low and and Satan is just trampling all
[32:57] over me and my mind is his playground
[33:00] and so on and so forth. Wait a second.
[33:02] What changed?
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; If faith is a revelation that's given
[33:07] from God, it's a revelation when you're
[33:09] feeling good and it's a revelation when
[33:12] you're feeling bad.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[33:17] [snorts]
[33:19] [clears throat]
[33:19] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why so many people are
[33:21] tossed to and fro.
[33:24] It's not because they don't love God,
[33:27] but it's because they're trying to work
[33:30] themselves up into something that they
[33:33] are making unattainable.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to Have you ever
[33:38] tried to do something that perhaps it
[33:41] it's out of your league to do and you
[33:42] just can't do it, but you keep trying to
[33:44] do it?
[33:45] &gt;&gt; How frustrating is that?
[33:48] You ever You ever set a goal and you
[33:50] think, "I'm making my goals big, man.
[33:53] big. I'm going to drop 50 pounds. And
[33:57] and and and you drop 30, which is
[33:59] awesome, BUT YOU FEEL BAD BECAUSE YOU
[34:02] CAN'T get to 50. And and you can never
[34:04] get to that goal because it's
[34:06] unattainable.
[34:08] It's it's just not attainable. And a lot
[34:12] of us, we do that with faith. We set
[34:15] these big goals and the FAITH IS WAY UP
[34:17] HERE and we're trying to climb the
[34:18] ladder and we fall down the ladder and
[34:20] well faith is right there and if I could
[34:23] just get to there everything will be
[34:24] okay. And we climb and we fall and we
[34:26] climb and we fall until we stop
[34:28] climbing.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Is the ladder really even worth
[34:32] climbing?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; And it's because of our conception
[34:39] &gt;&gt; of faith.
[34:44] The prophet said that if you had enough
[34:46] faith that you could go and you could
[34:48] create a world and you could go live on
[34:50] that world. Anybody ever heard the
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; the quote powerful quote.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is is trying to tell us
[34:58] that all things are possible.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; But let me ask you a question. If you
[35:05] were to create a world, what kind of
[35:07] world would you create to live in?
[35:10] Do you think that you were able to
[35:12] create a world and what would it be
[35:14] like?
[35:16] Would it just be would it just be one
[35:18] little imagery of of this of this
[35:20] perfect LITTLE ROOM WITH YOU AND nobody
[35:22] else there? Why would you want to create
[35:25] a world and go and live in it by
[35:27] yourself anyways?
[35:30] &gt;&gt; So I could get away from everybody
[35:33] because everybody else is my problem in
[35:36] life. You'll find out if you go to that
[35:40] world. Chances are your troubles will go
[35:43] with you.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; What kind of world would it be? You
[35:50] know, so much of the time we can become
[35:52] recluse
[35:54] and we want to get on a world on our own
[35:56] and we want to and we want to do that.
[35:57] We want to have the faith for that. You
[35:59] know what? That is is actually contrary
[36:02] to God
[36:04] &gt;&gt; because God was alone.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wasn't happy that he was
[36:08] alone.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; He was lonely. Therefore, he had a plan
[36:11] in his mind that he created a world.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And not only did he have the beginning
[36:16] in mind, but he had the ending in mind.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; And he had everything in between in his
[36:22] mind. And this plan that God has is
[36:24] perfect. And why did he want to why did
[36:27] he want to create people? Why did he
[36:29] want to have sons and daughters? Because
[36:31] he craved fellowship.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Understand? And it's not good for you to
[36:36] be alone.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; It's not good for you to be in an island
[36:40] all by yourself with just you and your
[36:42] family. You need fellowship.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm better off all by
[36:49] myself." No, you're not. Because God
[36:51] gave you a helpmate.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't good that Adam dwelt alone.
[36:56] And so therefore, he gave Adam a wife.
[37:00] But he didn't stop with Eve.
[37:03] He told them, "Go forth and multiply."
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[37:07] &gt;&gt; You see, it wasn't good that he was
[37:09] alone, and it wasn't good enough that
[37:11] God give him a wife, but he gave him a
[37:13] wife to multiply and replenish the
[37:16] earth. Therefore, it's good for you to
[37:20] replenish the earth. The McNeel are
[37:22] trying their best, but we're just one
[37:25] family.
[37:27] There's only so much they can do.
[37:31] [snorts] But what I'm saying is, what
[37:33] I'm saying for anybody online, we got
[37:35] six kids, you know, judge all you want.
[37:38] It's okay.
[37:42] What I'm saying is this. I'm saying that
[37:45] it's not good for you to be alone.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; That you need friendship. That you need
[37:52] family. That you need you need a
[37:55] relationship with other people. BECAUSE
[37:58] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT iron strengthens
[38:00] iron.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; The uncertain cell 1961, brother
[38:04] Brandham says, "Now if you're not
[38:06] certain, then you can't have faith. If
[38:09] there's no certainty, you cannot have
[38:11] any faith because faith is something
[38:13] that's certain." I like that. It's
[38:16] certain. It's true. It's real. It's
[38:19] steadfast. It's certain. faith. He says,
[38:24] you know, uh faith is the substance of
[38:26] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[38:28] not seen. It's not a myth. It's not just
[38:30] an imagination. It's not hope, but it's
[38:34] faith.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; He says faith is a substance. It's
[38:37] something that God has given you. Amen.
[38:40] And then you do not see it, but you just
[38:44] you just as sure got it as if you had it
[38:47] right in your hands. Faith is what
[38:49] purchases the product that you are
[38:52] hoping for. So, brother Brandham says
[38:54] it's it's not a myth. It's not an
[38:57] imagination of your mind. Nor is it a
[39:00] hope. Faith doesn't hope. But faith
[39:04] doesn't hope that God will or that
[39:06] thought that God can. But faith knows
[39:09] that God will.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between can and
[39:14] will.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:18] So, it isn't the intellects of our minds
[39:20] that we're trying to bring ourselves
[39:23] into this substance.
[39:26] It's not an imagination.
[39:28] [snorts] It's not a myth, but it's real.
[39:31] Faith is something that's tangible.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Something that you can hold on to. Faith
[39:37] is a gift from God that God gives to
[39:41] every one of us. It's it's something
[39:43] that we possess as believers.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And grace
[39:52] are and faith we realize is the faith is
[39:58] a gra is the grace of God that is given
[40:01] to us.
[40:04] Some of you might think to yourselves
[40:05] tonight you know uh I don't have a whole
[40:09] lot of faith. But I want you to know
[40:12] something that you have more faith than
[40:15] what you think you have.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you why. Because you are
[40:19] here tonight.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Because it takes a faith. Now remember,
[40:24] and I'm just going to always go back to
[40:26] it so you know what my sermon title is.
[40:29] Is that faith is a revelation. And
[40:32] revelation is given from God. And so
[40:35] understand that to come to a church to
[40:38] come to church on a Wednesday night
[40:40] takes faith
[40:42] &gt;&gt; because coming to church on a Wednesday
[40:44] night, guess what? It's never uh um it's
[40:48] never easy.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; When is coming to church on a Wednesday
[40:53] night easy? When do you ever have an
[40:55] easy day on a Wednesday at work? When
[40:58] are the kids ever easy for you at home
[41:00] on a Wednesday? When is it ever
[41:03] convenient to drive to church in Phoenix
[41:06] in rush hour traffic on a Wednesday
[41:08] night? It is never convenient to come to
[41:12] church on a Wednesday night. And perhaps
[41:14] that's why sometimes uh we don't have as
[41:18] many people here on a Wednesday as we do
[41:20] on a Sunday because Wednesdays aren't
[41:22] convenient,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Satan makes it that way on purpose.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; You know what? But if we were to change
[41:30] church to a Thursday night to make it
[41:31] more convenient, it would still wouldn't
[41:33] be convenient.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; If we changed it to a Tuesday night, it
[41:37] still wouldn't be convenient. The same
[41:39] people who are here right now would be
[41:41] here on a Tuesday night.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; The same people who are here right now
[41:45] would be here on a Thursday night or a
[41:47] Friday night. Why? Because God has given
[41:50] YOU A REVELATION. GOD has given you
[41:53] faith that it's more important to be at
[41:56] church on whatever day of the week it is
[41:58] than to be staying at home.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. It's a faith that God
[42:04] has given you that the Bible says uh the
[42:07] Bible says that uh uh whenever when
[42:10] brother Brandham said this that whenever
[42:12] the church doors are open, I want to be
[42:14] there.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; And any true son or daughter of God,
[42:19] they'll think the same thing. They'll
[42:22] say, "When those doors are open, I want
[42:24] to be a church. I don't care who's
[42:26] preaching. I don't care how many people
[42:28] is going to be there, but I have a
[42:30] revelation that I want to feed upon the
[42:33] word that it's feeding my spiritual
[42:35] soul."
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation that's been given to
[42:42] you personally. It's a faith that has
[42:46] been given to you that you say, uh, I'm
[42:49] not going to make any excuses.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to plan my day accordingly.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to plan my Wednesday afternoon
[43:00] accordingly so I can get to church on
[43:03] time. Is this okay?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; And you all do it because you're here.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to plan my day. I'm going
[43:11] to BE A GOOD STEWARD of my time. Um, I'm
[43:14] going to make sure that, hey, if you got
[43:16] to if you got to make mac and cheese for
[43:18] the family. You know, I trust that some
[43:20] of you fathers could care less about
[43:23] what's for dinner, you could care less
[43:25] if it's spaghettiio's and toast with
[43:28] melted cheese on top. As long as you're
[43:30] at the church on time.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Spaghettiio's with melted cheese on top
[43:36] and toast. That's Irish right there.
[43:39] [laughter]
[43:41] I have not had that in a long time.
[43:44] [laughter]
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [snorts]
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Spaghettiio. M.
[43:51] Let's just dismiss and all go to
[43:53] someone's house for spaghettiio and
[43:55] toast. [laughter]
[43:58] [snorts] But understand, when something
[44:00] is revealed to you, [clears throat]
[44:03] there's nothing that's going to hold you
[44:04] back from doing it.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A revelation that's
[44:08] been from God. And then you realize and
[44:10] you say, "Wow, my Wednesday has been so
[44:13] hard today." Then you have a little bit
[44:16] of spiritual understanding because in
[44:18] our opening scripture, it said faith
[44:20] upon faith. And so God adds to our faith
[44:24] more faith. And we begin to use
[44:26] discernment that whenever everything is
[44:28] kind of uh going lopsided on a
[44:31] Wednesday, we realize tonight I really
[44:35] need to be at church.
[44:39] This isn't up for question.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO CHURCH BECAUSE I NEED TO be
[44:45] there.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; What I don't understand is this and let
[44:52] me bring let me bring a little bit of a
[44:55] balance to this. I realize that
[44:57] sometimes in our lives that the day can
[45:01] get away from us and that things can
[45:03] happen and we just can't make it. and
[45:07] you know you just can't make it. You
[45:09] know it's not going to happen and it
[45:11] gets away from us. And guess what?
[45:14] That's okay.
[45:16] That's why we have streaming. That's why
[45:18] we have these guys that are so faithful
[45:20] and and and and and the video and the
[45:23] sound and all these different things.
[45:24] It's just in case that if we can't make
[45:27] it on a Wednesday or a Sunday that that
[45:30] there's something there that we can just
[45:32] that we can stream and we can enjoy the
[45:34] word of the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And help me understand this if you know
[45:40] the answer because I don't I don't
[45:44] understand why people choose to stay at
[45:48] home.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Perhaps you're streaming right now and
[45:52] you're a chooser to stay at home. I
[45:55] don't understand you.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; I don't get it.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense to me. Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know why that someone would
[46:06] choose on a regular basis.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about once in a while
[46:10] because we've all been there and we're
[46:12] all going to be there in the future.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; But every Wednesday
[46:16] &gt;&gt; that there's always an excuse that every
[46:18] Wednesday uh uh the animal is always in
[46:21] the ditch. That every Wednesday you
[46:23] choose to work instead of getting home
[46:26] for church.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I don't understand that.
[46:32] It doesn't make sense to me
[46:35] &gt;&gt; not as a minister and not as a lay
[46:38] member
[46:39] &gt;&gt; because before I was a minister I was at
[46:42] church
[46:43] &gt;&gt; on a Wednesday and on a Sunday. I didn't
[46:46] want to miss because there's some
[46:48] there's a hunger. Yes. Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; There's a hunger that I that I hunger
[46:51] and I thirst FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND I
[46:53] FIND it in the word. And I find it that
[46:56] I'M COMFORTED WHEN I GO to church and I
[46:59] hear the WORD OF GOD. IT it comforts my
[47:01] heart. It comforts my soul.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; But now we can
[47:10] perhaps we can put on a our spiritual
[47:13] thinking cap and we say, "Well, what's
[47:15] really going on?
[47:18] Why is something wrong?
[47:22] What's going on with the family? What's
[47:25] going on with the husband and wife? We
[47:28] What's going on?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Understand, saints of God.
[47:34] Whenever you start missing a Wednesday
[47:36] night service on the regular, something
[47:38] is wrong.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Because it's not the same as sitting in
[47:43] service.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Faith by experience 1958 and this is
[47:55] this is quite a lengthy quote about 10
[47:58] paragraphs. Brother Brandham says now
[48:00] faith is a substance it's like this
[48:02] perhaps well you found me somewhere
[48:05] starving to death and I told you I was
[48:06] hungry and one loaf of bread would save
[48:08] my life and and you would reach into
[48:10] your pocket and you give me 25 cents.
[48:12] Say here brother Brandham you don't need
[48:14] to starve. I'll give you 25 cents and
[48:16] get a loaf of bread. Now, I'd be just as
[48:19] happy with that 25 cents as I would be
[48:21] if I had the bread. Why? I've got the
[48:23] purchase power of the loaf of bread in
[48:26] my possession.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I cannot eat the 25 cents, but the
[48:31] 25 cents will buy the bread. And now,
[48:34] faith is the 25 cents. If you got faith
[48:36] in your heart, you're just as happy with
[48:38] the faith that your crippled hand will
[48:40] move as you would be if you were moving
[48:42] it. Because it's the faith is the
[48:44] purchasing power of your healing. So
[48:48] understand the faith that you already
[48:50] have, the revelation that you already
[48:53] have is the purchasing power of what you
[48:56] are in need of. You you already got the
[48:59] money in the bank.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; You just got to use the money. And a lot
[49:03] of times that we're we're asking for
[49:05] something from God and and WE'RE SAYING,
[49:07] "GOD, UH, PLEASE HELP ME and give me
[49:09] faith for such a thing." And God God
[49:12] sends something our way.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; It's like this. I I say you wanted to uh
[49:17] you wanted a cake for somebody's
[49:19] birthday and God gives you flour. He
[49:22] gives you eggs. He gives you water. Then
[49:24] he gives you some uh salted caramel or
[49:26] whatever.
[49:28] And you say, "This is not what I wanted.
[49:30] I wanted a cake." Well, you got the cake
[49:33] right in front of you.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS put the ingredients
[49:38] together. And so, brother Brandham is
[49:40] saying this 25 cents, it's the
[49:42] purchasing power of what I am in need
[49:44] of. That's the faith. So, I I I already
[49:48] I as good as have it right now with this
[49:51] money as I would as my crippled hand
[49:53] moving.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; It all depends on how you look at it.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; It all depends on the revelation that
[50:01] you got uh uh concerning the word of
[50:05] God.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] He says, "Now, maybe with the 25 cents,
[50:11] I'd just I'd be just as hungry as I was
[50:14] before I received it, and it might have
[50:16] to go several I might have to go several
[50:18] miles before I could get the loaf of
[50:20] bread. I might have to go through the
[50:22] brier patch." Understand? Sometimes
[50:26] whatever you pray for and whatever
[50:27] you're asking for, it doesn't manifest
[50:30] itself right away.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; sometimes you got to go through the
[50:34] brier patch,
[50:36] &gt;&gt; up over the mountain, cross over the
[50:38] bridge, wait through water, but all the
[50:40] time I'm going, I'm rejoicing because
[50:43] I've got the purchasing power of that
[50:45] loaf of bread. Now, Brother Brandham is
[50:48] using a natural type that we might
[50:50] understand what he's spiritually talking
[50:53] about. He's saying, "You have faith. The
[50:56] purchasing power is right here, but you
[50:59] might not be able to buy it right away.
[51:01] Therefore, you'll have to go through
[51:03] life's journey.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; You might have to go up a mountain. You
[51:07] might have to go down into a valley. You
[51:09] might have to wade a river. You might
[51:11] have to do things that you're
[51:12] uncomfortable with. But as long as you
[51:15] have the purchasing power of faith in
[51:18] your hand, you're just as happy as you
[51:20] were
[51:22] &gt;&gt; until you get the thing that you're
[51:23] looking for.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I got it right here. 25 cents. Ah, loaf
[51:29] of bread is only 20.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; I got 5 cents left over. Huh? Can you
[51:34] imagine? You ever saved for something
[51:36] that you want to buy and all of a sudden
[51:39] you got the money and you're on your way
[51:40] to buy it. You're like, "Praise the
[51:42] Lord. I've been saving so long for
[51:44] this." And it feels good because you got
[51:47] the money is there and it and you can
[51:49] use the money that you've saved it for.
[51:52] It's as good as in your hand already.
[51:54] Just you just don't have it yet. You
[51:56] just haven't purchased it yet.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to be thinking of your needs
[52:03] right now.
[52:05] Whatever they may be. I don't know. In a
[52:07] congregation this size, we all have
[52:10] different needs within our life,
[52:12] financially, spiritually, the home life,
[52:15] kids, whatever it might be. But
[52:17] understand, if you got a revelation of
[52:19] the word of God and the promises that
[52:21] God gives to us through his word, we
[52:24] have the purchasing power already in our
[52:27] hands.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; The problem is the journey.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; The problem is the mountain.
[52:39] The problem is the briars.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Briers leave scratches. Briars leave
[52:44] marks.
[52:46] The problem is waiting through the
[52:48] water. These are the problems that we
[52:51] face. But as long as you have a
[52:54] revelation in your hand, as long as you
[52:57] got the 25 cents, as long as you GOT THE
[53:00] PURCHASING POWER, WHEN IT COMES time to
[53:03] purchase the product, you can buy it
[53:05] right there and then.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; That's real faith.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[53:16] &gt;&gt; And when faith really hits the heart,
[53:19] paragraph 20, it doesn't have to be a
[53:22] spontaneous miracle. As we were watching
[53:24] last night, the man laying here in the
[53:26] cot with a great big swelled up
[53:27] condition in his stomach. And I was
[53:29] fixing to leave and the Holy Spirit
[53:31] called me and I looked and saw the
[53:32] vision over the man. And the moment he
[53:34] responded to it, his stomach went right
[53:37] down like that. And off the cot he went
[53:39] rejoicing through the building. or the
[53:41] persons in the stretchers the other
[53:42] night or in the wheelchair. Understand
[53:44] these things was a uh uh they happened
[53:48] on a on a on a current basis in brother
[53:50] Brandham's ministry. But he's saying now
[53:53] just because that happened here, it
[53:55] doesn't have to be that way.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; He said see
[54:02] uh
[54:03] uh it is the substance of things hoped
[54:06] for the evidence of things not seen. You
[54:08] [snorts] don't have to feel nothing. You
[54:10] don't have to taste nothing. Only thing
[54:13] you have to do is to believe something
[54:17] and it becomes a positive something that
[54:20] you possess. That is your faith.
[54:23] Understand? You don't have to believe uh
[54:26] in a word of a man, but we're believing
[54:28] in the word of God.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and every need that we are in need
[54:35] of in our life, it is written within the
[54:39] word.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; But we need a revelation of it
[54:45] &gt;&gt; because so much of the time
[54:47] the journey disrupts us
[54:50] &gt;&gt; and Satan uses the journey to discourage
[54:53] us.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And why does Satan want to discourage
[54:57] us? This is a quote in uh in in in the
[55:00] revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother
[55:02] Brandham says that Satan wants to take
[55:05] your confidence away from the word.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And so you got this purchased possession
[55:12] in your hand. You you you've got it
[55:14] THERE AND IT'S FAITH and you and you're
[55:16] standing upon the word of God. But Satan
[55:18] now uses the journey to disrupt our
[55:22] faith, to disrupt our thinking, to cause
[55:25] unbelief to come into our lives. And all
[55:28] of a sudden, we get discouraged and we
[55:30] and we lose the confidence in the word
[55:33] of God.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; We've all been there.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, don't be there again
[55:41] &gt;&gt; because there's no need to be
[55:43] discouraged with God.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:47] Because God's timing is perfect.
[55:49] [snorts]
[55:52] &gt;&gt; He said you cannot accept it by
[55:54] paragraph 23 by intellectual thought.
[55:57] That's intellectual. Your minds will
[55:59] reason. But faith does not reason. If
[56:02] you got intellectual faith, then it's
[56:03] just a reasoning faith. You'll say,
[56:05] "Well, if I only was healed, I could get
[56:08] up. I only was healed, this lump would
[56:10] leave. If I only was healed, I'd feel
[56:12] different. If I only was healed, the
[56:14] doctor would tell me so." But when
[56:16] you've got faith, all the doctors in the
[56:18] world could never tell you anything
[56:19] different. You possess that. It is the
[56:22] substance of things hoped for, the
[56:25] evidence of things not seen. He's
[56:27] bringing us back to it's a substance.
[56:30] It's an evidence. It's real. It's
[56:33] concrete. It's an absolute.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, usually we find most
[56:40] people are afraid to accept it. And
[56:41] usually people who have faith in someone
[56:43] who has experienced faith. Now when you
[56:46] accept Jesus as your personal savior,
[56:48] there is not a way in the world for you
[56:50] to ever be saved only by your faith. You
[56:54] had to accept it. You had to believe it.
[56:56] Notice you could get down to the altar
[56:58] and could cry all night long. And you
[57:00] could beat upon the altar and scream
[57:02] until you could scream no more and still
[57:04] you're not saved. You could feel real
[57:07] good and run all over the building
[57:08] shouting and still not be saved. The
[57:11] devil can beat you around to stump on
[57:13] your feelings. If I had to go by my
[57:16] feelings, there would be many times I
[57:17] would be all out of condition. But I
[57:20] don't rest on my feelings. I rest upon
[57:23] the unconditional word of the living God
[57:25] who made the covenant with me if I would
[57:28] believe it. It's not what I feel, it's
[57:30] what I believe. Jesus never did say,
[57:32] "Did you feel it?" He said, "Do you
[57:34] believe it?
[57:36] Faith happens is far beyond feeling. You
[57:38] could feel tonight you're saved and run
[57:40] around praising God and the next morning
[57:42] you wouldn't have any feeling about it
[57:43] all. Then you say, "I'm lost again." But
[57:45] when faith takes a hold to Jesus Christ,
[57:48] God's son died in yourstead and he
[57:50] become you and your sins and that you
[57:53] and your sins might become him and his
[57:54] righteousness and accept him as your
[57:56] only propitiation for your sins. Then
[57:59] faith takes a hold and all devils out of
[58:02] hell can't move it. Faith endures. Faith
[58:05] locks something. It seals something.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham is pulling us away
[58:11] from our from our feelings and thoughts
[58:13] and emotions and and and he's saying,
[58:15] "No, it's faith. It's a revelation and
[58:18] the unadulterated word of God. It's
[58:22] faith in the unconditional promise that
[58:24] God has given onto us."
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you for those.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That's too simple.
[58:33] Why do I just have to read the word and
[58:37] believe it? Why can't I feel something?
[58:40] Why can't I run? Why can't There's
[58:42] nothing saying that you can't. But
[58:44] understand, brother Brand, I'm saying
[58:45] you could do all those things and still
[58:46] not be saved until faith anchors. If
[58:50] thou shalt believe in thine heart,
[58:53] hallelujah, that Jesus Christ had died
[58:55] for your sins AND HE ROSE AGAIN, THOU
[58:58] SHALT BE SAVED. That's the Steven
[59:00] version.
[59:02] You've got to believe it.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And until you believe it, you're going
[59:07] to be saved one day and lost the other
[59:09] day.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; But when faith truly anchors down,
[59:14] you know, you could you could bump into
[59:16] the people you used to run with and they
[59:19] could say, "Hey, hey, Steve, let's go
[59:22] let's go X, Y, and Z." I'm all, "No, I'm
[59:25] only ABC now."
[59:29] always believe Christ.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing XYZ ANYMORE. WELL, WHY
[59:33] NOT?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Because I'm a Christian.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Because I got converted
[59:38] &gt;&gt; because something changed in my life. My
[59:39] desires are no longer the same. I'm a
[59:42] changed person. THE OLD MAN HAS PASSED
[59:44] AWAY. NOW BEHOLD, all things have become
[59:46] new.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And so what happens when faith takes a
[59:50] hold in your life? Your conversation
[59:52] changes.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Your life changes. your your what you
[59:57] profess, it changes. There's a
[59:59] manifestation in the life that you live.
[1:00:02] And everybody else will look around and
[1:00:04] they'll say, "There's been a change in
[1:00:06] that young man's life."
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; I don't go to those places no more. Let
[1:00:13] me ask you something. What is speaking?
[1:00:15] Faith is speaking.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that or go there
[1:00:19] anymore? Because I'm a believer
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; and I don't do those things no more,
[1:00:24] unbeliever.
[1:00:28] Believers do not run with unbelievers.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Believers do not date unbelievers.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Believers do not marry unbelievers.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Y'all ought to be shouting, "Amen."
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh.
[1:00:53] No. You know why? It's not just a rule.
[1:00:57] There's reasons for it.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. How can two
[1:01:03] walk together unless they be in
[1:01:06] agreement?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine trying to go to church
[1:01:10] on a Wednesday night married to an
[1:01:12] unbeliever?
[1:01:14] Good luck, Jack.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Good luck, Sally.
[1:01:19] Because one is going to want to go and
[1:01:21] the other one's not. And it's going to
[1:01:23] be a constant battle and a constant
[1:01:26] fight. Why not marry a believer
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; who has the same passions,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; who has the same love, who's had the
[1:01:36] same birth as what you have had. It'll
[1:01:38] make your Christian walk so much easier.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] So something
[1:01:49] changes
[1:01:52] our discussions change how we think it
[1:01:55] changes. Why? Because revelation which
[1:01:58] is faith. Faith is a revelation now is
[1:02:02] now beginning to take control of this
[1:02:05] earthly tabernacle.
[1:02:07] Revelation is the power of
[1:02:11] transformation.
[1:02:14] Revelation is the power of
[1:02:17] transformation. You cannot transform
[1:02:20] yourself intellectually. You cannot say,
[1:02:23] "Well, I I want to be a good boy and I
[1:02:25] want to do this and I want to be a good
[1:02:27] person." That's not how it works. You've
[1:02:29] got to give it to GOD AND LET GOD do the
[1:02:32] rest.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; And when it becomes a revelation to you
[1:02:36] personally, there's no more uh well, I
[1:02:40] really want to do this, but I can't. I
[1:02:42] really want to go there, but I can't.
[1:02:44] It's not even in the picture anymore.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because revelation upon revelation
[1:02:52] is now taking this earth, this this
[1:02:55] dominion, this domain that that I am
[1:02:58] that I am living within. This this
[1:03:00] dominion that I am trapped within.
[1:03:03] Now it becomes subject to the spirit of
[1:03:08] God because of revelation, because of
[1:03:11] faith that God is implanting in my heart
[1:03:14] by the revealed word of the hour.
[1:03:17] Understand God has given to you dominion
[1:03:20] not only over this earth but upon this
[1:03:23] earth right here. And this is the earth
[1:03:26] that we need to take control of because
[1:03:29] it's this thing that gets us in so much
[1:03:31] trouble.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:33] How do I control it? How do I CONTROL MY
[1:03:36] EMOTIONS? HOW DO I CONTROL MY TEMPER? BY
[1:03:40] THE power of revelation, by the faith of
[1:03:43] God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; we see in the days of Noah that the
[1:03:53] earth was filled with violence and the
[1:03:54] thoughts of man's heart was continually
[1:03:58] uh continually evil until it actually
[1:04:01] repented the Lord that he had ever made
[1:04:03] man upon the earth. And we understand
[1:04:06] that we're living in the same conditions
[1:04:07] that Noah lived in. And we find out that
[1:04:10] the Bible says, "But Noah in Genesis 6:8
[1:04:14] that Noah found grace in the eyes of the
[1:04:17] Lord."
[1:04:19] Now, this grace was manifested onto Noah
[1:04:23] in verse 13 of chapter 6. And it says,
[1:04:27] "And God said unto Noah, the end of
[1:04:29] flesh has come before me, for the earth
[1:04:31] is filled with violence through them,
[1:04:33] and behold, uh, I will destroy them with
[1:04:38] the earth." And so now Noah had found
[1:04:41] grace in the eyes of God. And the grace
[1:04:44] of God was now manifested onto Noah
[1:04:48] whenever God spoke to Noah by his own
[1:04:51] voice.
[1:04:53] And so the grace of God was manifested
[1:04:56] by his voice.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. When did
[1:05:01] Noah find grace in the eyes of God? Did
[1:05:04] he find grace in the eyes of God 120
[1:05:07] years before the flood? Was it when Noah
[1:05:09] was born? Was it The Bible says that
[1:05:11] Noah walked with God. Was it only when
[1:05:13] Noah was walking with God? That's not
[1:05:16] the answer. God. Noah found grace in the
[1:05:19] eyes of God since before the foundations
[1:05:22] of the world.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; And it was just at this particular time
[1:05:26] that the grace of God now begin to
[1:05:29] unfold onto Noah. Though though Though
[1:05:32] he was surrounded with violence, though
[1:05:34] he was surrounded by evil, he was
[1:05:36] surrounded by perversion. But yet he
[1:05:39] walked with God and he found grace with
[1:05:42] God. And the grace of God was manifested
[1:05:44] to Noah by his spoken word voice.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; What did that voice say?
[1:05:54] That voice, it was a voice of
[1:05:57] preparation.
[1:05:59] He told Noah, "I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:06:01] destroy all flesh. I'm I'm going to
[1:06:03] flood this place with water. Uh every it
[1:06:06] repenteth me. I am disgusted with this
[1:06:10] with what mankind has turned into. I'm
[1:06:13] going to get rid of it all. But no, I'm
[1:06:15] going to speak to you right now and I'm
[1:06:16] going to tell you to prepare an ark and
[1:06:18] I'm going to tell you how it needs to be
[1:06:20] done and how it needs to be built and
[1:06:22] I'm going to give you the dimensions and
[1:06:24] so on and so forth. It was a voice of
[1:06:27] preparation. What was he preparing him
[1:06:30] for? He was preparing him that he might
[1:06:33] overcome the judgment that was coming
[1:06:36] upon the earth. It was a voice of
[1:06:38] preparation. It was a voice of warning
[1:06:42] before judgment. You see, God never
[1:06:45] changes. That before God sends judgment
[1:06:48] upon the earth, he's always going to
[1:06:51] send a warning.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; And how does he send a warning? He uses
[1:06:55] his own voice.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; He speaks. He speaks to the nation. He
[1:07:00] speaks to the country. He speaks to the
[1:07:02] world. How does he do it? through his
[1:07:04] servants, the prophets.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; What is his voice? It's a voice of
[1:07:12] prepare.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Behold, the bridegroom is coming.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; The midnight HOUR IS HERE. UH ARISE and
[1:07:20] trim your lamps. What kind of voice is
[1:07:23] it? It is a voice of warning.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; It is a voice of uh the bridegroom is
[1:07:28] coming. It is a voice of preparation.
[1:07:31] Wake out of your sleep. the situation
[1:07:34] that you're in. Wake out of your sleep,
[1:07:36] oh thou slugard.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord is coming.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; It's a voice of preparation. It is a
[1:07:44] voice of warning before judgment strikes
[1:07:47] the earth.
[1:07:50] You know, it's pretty interesting.
[1:07:52] You've heard people say, you know, uh uh
[1:07:56] if I was to only
[1:08:00] if I was to only hear the voice of God,
[1:08:03] I would be okay.
[1:08:06] If I could just just hear his voice, how
[1:08:09] he spoke to Noah. If I could just hear
[1:08:12] his voice of how he spoke to Abraham. If
[1:08:15] it was just a clear audible voice,
[1:08:18] everything would be okay. My life would
[1:08:20] be all right. I I would be I would be so
[1:08:23] uh overcome by by the presence of God by
[1:08:27] his voice that I would do everything
[1:08:29] that he tells me to do.
[1:08:32] But yet Amos 3 chapter 7 says that God
[1:08:36] will do nothing
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; until he reveals his ser his secret to
[1:08:40] his servants the prophets.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; So before God does anything he reveals
[1:08:45] his word to his prophet which now speaks
[1:08:47] the word to us. What is the word that we
[1:08:51] hear from a prophet? It is the voice of
[1:08:54] God.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And we say, "If only I was to hear the
[1:08:59] voice of God. If only I was to recognize
[1:09:02] that still small voice when he would
[1:09:04] speak to me, everything would be okay
[1:09:06] and life would be all right." LET ME ASK
[1:09:08] YOU, WHAT ARE you listening to through
[1:09:10] 1100 sermons?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I tell you what I hear. I hear the voice
[1:09:15] behind the voice.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I hear the voice of God. It is a voice
[1:09:19] of warning, A VOICE OF PREPARATION, a
[1:09:23] voice of him telling me what he likes,
[1:09:25] what he dislikes, a voice of a of him
[1:09:27] telling me what lays ahead in the
[1:09:29] future. A voice that he's telling me the
[1:09:32] secret things that's written within his
[1:09:34] word. It's not the voice of a man.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; But if you'll listen with revelation,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; it's the very voice of God himself.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] Now, if you make the man God, when the
[1:09:51] man went off the scene, you'll take the
[1:09:53] voice off the scene with him.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But the man was a man. He was a man used
[1:09:59] of God. He was a prophet. I believe
[1:10:02] there was no other prophet like William
[1:10:04] Marian Brham.
[1:10:06] And there never will be.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; But yet, his voice was not God's voice.
[1:10:14] God's voice was behind the voice.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's the picture within the picture.
[1:10:24] We no longer have to wonder what does
[1:10:26] God think about this?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; What does God think about holiness?
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; What does God think about a sanctified
[1:10:34] life?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; What does God think about a man uh
[1:10:38] pinning up the wrong kind of things on
[1:10:40] his walls and listening to the wrong
[1:10:41] kind of music? We know what God thinks
[1:10:44] about these things.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; How do we know these things? How do we
[1:10:48] know how to walk in this day that we're
[1:10:50] living in? Because God has spoken
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; and he has told us.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT IF I was to only hear the voice
[1:10:58] of God from lip to ear.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I would I would get in my position. I
[1:11:03] would do what I'm told. I would live for
[1:11:05] God the right way. My brother, my
[1:11:07] sister,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; if that's your thoughts, you're missing
[1:11:10] it.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; What is this message to you anyways?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; What is this message doing for you? Is
[1:11:23] it just a title message?
[1:11:26] Is it just is it just sermons? Is it
[1:11:28] just a way of life? Or is it the life?
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; What is it to you? Answer the question.
[1:11:37] Because if it's not God, let me say
[1:11:39] this. It's either all God or nothing of
[1:11:42] it's God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want to pick and choose. Well,
[1:11:46] this part is of God and this part isn't
[1:11:48] of God. And this, let me tell you
[1:11:49] something. In Brother Brandham's uh uh
[1:11:52] the mistakes that he made in his own
[1:11:54] life was of God.
[1:11:59] If Brother Brandham said something that
[1:12:00] was wrong at some point, I want to say
[1:12:02] this, it was of God.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Because God does things for a reason.
[1:12:07] Could you imagine? And some of you are
[1:12:11] going to get real tight on me right now,
[1:12:12] and that's okay. But could you imagine
[1:12:16] if Brother Brandham lived a perfect life
[1:12:18] before us?
[1:12:21] Could you imagine if he never let us
[1:12:23] give us uh insidefo
[1:12:26] to the things that he done or said that
[1:12:28] was wrong? Could you imagine how we
[1:12:30] would feel?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Could you could you imagine what that
[1:12:35] would do to us? We would place the man
[1:12:37] up as God.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And even with his mistakes and with his
[1:12:41] downfalls, because he had plenty,
[1:12:45] you know, Brother Brandon was a liar.
[1:12:50] Sure he was.
[1:12:54] Tell him. Tell him I'm not in.
[1:12:57] Really? Yeah. Tell him I'm not in. He
[1:12:59] steps outside. You know what he just did
[1:13:01] to his wife?
[1:13:03] He just made his wife a liar.
[1:13:07] Can you imagine a prophet of God? You
[1:13:11] know, he could have just kept that
[1:13:12] secret. Well,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; these people, they they see me to be a
[1:13:17] prophet and and some even call me God.
[1:13:21] And if I was to tell him the truth about
[1:13:24] how my kids are kind of hectic at home
[1:13:26] sometimes,
[1:13:29] you know, we have this we have this
[1:13:30] within the message that everything's got
[1:13:32] to be perfect and you got to have a
[1:13:34] perfect family and you got to have
[1:13:36] perfect kids and you got to have perfect
[1:13:37] dad and we set this bar up so so high
[1:13:39] that it's on a table attainable. But
[1:13:41] guess what? EVEN IN THE PROPHET'S OWN
[1:13:43] FAMILY,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Billy Paul WOULD HAND OUT PRAYER CARDS
[1:13:48] AND then he would go and HOT ROD AND
[1:13:49] SMOKE AND DRINK OR WHATEVER. Brother
[1:13:52] Brandham had it in his own life, in his
[1:13:55] own family. He had issues.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And if he had issues,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; go figure. You and I are going to have
[1:14:05] issues.
[1:14:07] But the issue doesn't have anything to
[1:14:09] do with with your with your uh uh
[1:14:13] Christianity or with your sunship or
[1:14:16] your daughtership or your position in
[1:14:18] Christ. It's just family issues.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; And guess what? Let me just let me just
[1:14:26] take some air out of the bubble.
[1:14:29] It's okay.
[1:14:32] You are allowed to make mistakes.
[1:14:38] And you are allowed for your family not
[1:14:41] to be perfect.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's okay
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; because guess what? None of us have a
[1:14:48] perfect family.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; None of none of you sisters have a
[1:14:52] perfect husband
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; and none of us husbands maybe all of you
[1:14:57] don't have a perfect wife. [laughter]
[1:15:00] Had to say that or I'll be in trouble.
[1:15:05] But let me say this.
[1:15:07] It's okay that everything is not
[1:15:10] perfect.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; It's okay
[1:15:16] because we feel this pressure
[1:15:19] of what are people going to think?
[1:15:24] What are people going to think of my
[1:15:26] spirituality? What what are they what
[1:15:28] what are they going to think? And I want
[1:15:30] I want people to think the best of me.
[1:15:33] And those of you who say you don't think
[1:15:35] like that, you're a liar.
[1:15:39] All of All of us want people to think
[1:15:41] the best of us,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; okay? That you're a good dad, you're a
[1:15:45] good mom, you got good kids,
[1:15:47] everything's in order, and everything's
[1:15:49] hunky dory.
[1:15:51] And it can build such a pressure in our
[1:15:53] lives.
[1:15:55] And it's a pressure that is that is that
[1:15:58] is self pressured.
[1:16:01] It is a balloon that we have blown up
[1:16:03] ourselves.
[1:16:05] You know what happens to a balloon that
[1:16:06] that reaches its elasticity?
[1:16:15] One more.
[1:16:20] All of a sudden, the thing goes pop
[1:16:24] and everybody sees the remains of the
[1:16:26] balloon all over the floor.
[1:16:29] My goodness, what happened to that
[1:16:30] balloon?
[1:16:32] The balloon imploded because we were
[1:16:35] giving it so much pressure and so much
[1:16:38] air that it couldn't handle.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, we need to learn to let
[1:16:44] off the pressure a little bit.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And we need to learn to realize that
[1:16:49] it's okay if our lives is not perfect.
[1:16:55] If you made the wrong decision and and
[1:16:57] and and whatever that decision may be,
[1:17:01] hey, guess what? It's okay.
[1:17:04] Dust yourself off, get up,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; and learn from it.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Let's not Let's not dwell upon this
[1:17:14] balloon that popped. Let's clean it up.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Where was I
[1:17:29] [snorts] now?
[1:17:31] Ah,
[1:17:33] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:17:36] Christ. Brother Brennham says, "And the
[1:17:37] revelation is the only thing, the
[1:17:39] revelation of the word." What is a
[1:17:42] revelation? Jesus said, "Upon this rock,
[1:17:44] I'll build my church, and the gates of
[1:17:46] hell can't prevail against it." Faith is
[1:17:48] a revelation because faith has been
[1:17:50] revealed to you.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; So we see that faith is a revelation.
[1:17:55] Faith is something that is sure. Faith
[1:17:59] is a solid rock. It's a solid
[1:18:01] foundation. It's something that you know
[1:18:04] personally that God has absolutely given
[1:18:07] to you. It is a revelation of the word
[1:18:10] and the will of God. That's what faith
[1:18:13] is. Faith isn't up here that's
[1:18:15] unattainable and you got to pray
[1:18:16] yourself up into it and you got to you
[1:18:18] got to you got to it's some kind of
[1:18:20] magical thing that happens. No, that's
[1:18:22] not what faith is. Faith is a revelation
[1:18:25] of the spoken word of God.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Now we find that that uh uh how do we
[1:18:39] the question is this.
[1:18:41] If faith is a revelation,
[1:18:45] how do I increase my faith? How do I
[1:18:50] increase my revelation? The answer is
[1:18:52] found in Romans chapter 10 verse1 17. It
[1:18:55] says, "So then faith cometh by hearing
[1:18:58] and hearing by the word of God." If you
[1:19:00] want to increase your faith, you've got
[1:19:03] to increase your hearing.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Now, what does it mean that faith cometh
[1:19:08] by hearing? What does it mean to hear?
[1:19:12] The Bible says in Revelation 2:7, "He
[1:19:15] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:19:18] Spirit saith unto the churches." John
[1:19:21] 5:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:19:24] he that hearth my word, believeth on him
[1:19:27] that sent me has everlasting life, and
[1:19:29] shall not come into condemnation, but is
[1:19:31] passed from death unto life." John 8:47,
[1:19:35] "He that is of God heareth God's words.
[1:19:39] Ye therefore hear them not, because ye
[1:19:43] are not of God."
[1:19:45] So, he's talking about if you hear my
[1:19:47] words and believe on him that sent me,
[1:19:49] you're going to have everlasting life.
[1:19:51] But does that mean that everybody that
[1:19:52] that hears the word of God with the the
[1:19:55] their two ears on the side of her head,
[1:19:57] does that mean that they're hearing what
[1:19:59] the word is saying? Does that mean that
[1:20:01] they're hearing what the spirit of say
[1:20:03] is saying? Because if you have an ear
[1:20:05] and you're able to listen, shouldn't you
[1:20:07] be able to hear what the word is saying?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Got a few more scriptures. Pilate
[1:20:14] therefore said unto him John 18 verse 37
[1:20:17] art thou a king? Then Jesus answered
[1:20:19] thou sayest that I am a king to this
[1:20:21] hand was I born and for this cause came
[1:20:23] I into the world that I should bear
[1:20:25] witness unto the truth. Everyone that is
[1:20:27] of the truth heareth my voice. So does
[1:20:32] that mean that the Pharisees and the
[1:20:35] Sadducees who heard his voice, does that
[1:20:38] mean that they are of him, that they are
[1:20:40] of Christ, because they heard his voice
[1:20:43] with the natural ear?
[1:20:46] Well, what does it mean then? What does
[1:20:48] it mean then that says he that heareth
[1:20:51] my words, he that hath an ear, if it's
[1:20:53] not a natural ear, what kind of ear is
[1:20:56] it?
[1:20:59] Mark 4 verse Mark 4:9 it says he that
[1:21:03] hath ears to hear let him hear.
[1:21:08] When the Bible refers to having ears to
[1:21:11] hear, it doesn't mean that it's only for
[1:21:14] people who are not deaf and have the
[1:21:16] ability to hear words and to hear
[1:21:18] language string together in sentences,
[1:21:21] but it actually means to hear with a
[1:21:24] spiritual understanding.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1964, his unfailing words of
[1:21:29] promise. I'm going to try to hurry now.
[1:21:32] But what are you doing now? You're going
[1:21:34] to accept eternal life. Look what Jesus
[1:21:37] said. He that heareth my words heareth
[1:21:40] means to understand.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; So it's not just in hearing the words
[1:21:46] that we're speaking, but it's actually
[1:21:48] having the ability to understand the
[1:21:52] words that are being spoken. He that
[1:21:55] hath an ear of understanding, let him
[1:21:58] hear what the spirit is saying unto the
[1:22:00] churches. He that hath an ear, let him
[1:22:03] hear.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So it's not everybody that has the
[1:22:07] ability to hear, but it's everybody that
[1:22:09] has the ability to understand what the
[1:22:13] spirit is saying.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:20] So we find that
[1:22:23] we got to increase our hearing. It
[1:22:26] doesn't necessarily mean that we have to
[1:22:28] increase the amount of tapes that we're
[1:22:30] listening to. Well, if I have to
[1:22:33] increase my hearing and and faith cometh
[1:22:35] by hearing and hearing of the word of
[1:22:36] God, I'm I'm just going to sit at home
[1:22:38] all day, then I'm going to listen to
[1:22:40] tapes. And when I'm when I'm at when I'm
[1:22:42] at home, I'm going to listen to tapes.
[1:22:43] When I'm at work, I'm going to listen.
[1:22:44] And when I'm here, I'm going to listen.
[1:22:46] And when I'm there and I'm going to
[1:22:47] increase my hearing until finally I can
[1:22:50] create a world that I can live in all by
[1:22:52] myself CUZ I HAVE THAT kind of faith
[1:22:54] because I've been hearing all of these
[1:22:56] words.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It's not in how much sermons that you're
[1:23:01] listening to. But it's in how much
[1:23:03] you're actually grasping.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; It's how much you're actually
[1:23:08] understanding. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; It's not how much Bible verses that you
[1:23:11] can memorize or how many chapters that
[1:23:13] you can read in a day, but it's how much
[1:23:16] that you can actually understand of what
[1:23:18] the spirit is saying through what you
[1:23:21] are reading or listening to. That's the
[1:23:24] secret to increasing your faith is
[1:23:27] increasing the understanding that you're
[1:23:30] listening to. And therefore, that faith
[1:23:32] is a revelation. And then you can
[1:23:34] believe that all things are possible to
[1:23:36] them that believe because your faith is
[1:23:39] strong according to revelation.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth.
[1:23:47] [clears throat]
[1:23:47] [snorts]
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; As the musicians come, I'll I'll bring
[1:23:50] this to a close. Faith is not
[1:23:56] faith is not uh
[1:23:59] being diagnosed with with with sugar
[1:24:02] diabetes
[1:24:04] and then drinking all the sugary
[1:24:06] products and eating all the sugary food
[1:24:08] that you can and saying, "Well, I'm
[1:24:10] going to trust in God and I'm going to
[1:24:13] have faith."
[1:24:15] That's not faith.
[1:24:18] Faith is not uh I'm going to get into my
[1:24:21] car and I'm going to close my eyes and
[1:24:23] drive on my way home because by faith
[1:24:28] God is going to direct my car.
[1:24:31] That's not faith. That's foolishness.
[1:24:36] Faith is not spending every dollar that
[1:24:38] you have in the bank and then saying,
[1:24:40] "Father,
[1:24:41] uh, on foolish things and then saying,
[1:24:44] "Father, increase my bank account." I
[1:24:48] have faith.
[1:24:50] I have all kinds of faith that if I
[1:24:52] drive with my eyes closed or or if I if
[1:24:55] I do this with my finances or if I do
[1:24:57] this over here that that if I just have
[1:24:59] faith in God that everything will be
[1:25:01] okay.
[1:25:03] That's not faith.
[1:25:05] Saints of God, that's foolishness.
[1:25:08] Brother Brandham says in a quote, he
[1:25:10] says, "Faith is a law."
[1:25:13] And in order for faith to work, you got
[1:25:16] to come by the laws.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And you can't be foolish in our everyday
[1:25:22] decisions in life and expect to have a
[1:25:25] revelation of the faith of God. It just
[1:25:28] doesn't work that way.
[1:25:31] You can't plant a seed of foolishness
[1:25:34] and expect this divine revelation to
[1:25:37] come and help you in your life.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; That's not how faith works.
[1:25:46] But faith is a revelation.
[1:25:49] And you have a revelation to know, you
[1:25:52] know what, this is a temple of God that
[1:25:54] God has given me. I'm going to treat it
[1:25:56] the right way.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And perhaps if I watch my diet and
[1:26:00] I take care of things a little bit, I
[1:26:02] might not have to take those pills. Or I
[1:26:05] might not have to do that. Or, you know,
[1:26:10] you know what's really interesting?
[1:26:14] You know, let me just use diabetes for
[1:26:16] example. Okay, we get a pill for
[1:26:19] diabetes. Takes care of it. Regulates
[1:26:21] our blood sugar. It's awesome. Praise
[1:26:24] the Lord.
[1:26:26] But a lot of people, they'll want to
[1:26:27] say, "Well, I want to have faith that I
[1:26:31] can stop taking the pills, that God will
[1:26:34] heal me of this diabetes." But yet,
[1:26:36] they're unwilling to change their
[1:26:38] lifestyle, the food and drink choices
[1:26:39] that they're making.
[1:26:42] Do you think God is going to do that?
[1:26:46] Maybe.
[1:26:48] But wouldn't you rather say, "You know
[1:26:50] what? I'm going to control what I can
[1:26:52] control over here in order that I don't
[1:26:55] have to do this over here anymore
[1:26:57] because I'm making the right decisions
[1:26:58] right here. Does that make sense?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Noah understood
[1:27:11] the voice of God when he heard it.
[1:27:14] And the voice of God got Noah into
[1:27:16] action.
[1:27:18] Why? because he had a revelation. There
[1:27:21] was never rain that had come upon the
[1:27:23] ground. He didn't know what a flood was
[1:27:25] that was going to flood the whole earth.
[1:27:27] He just knew that God said so. And
[1:27:30] because it was revealed to him, the
[1:27:32] voice of God for the day and hour in
[1:27:34] which he lived. And guess what it done?
[1:27:35] [music] It got him into action. The
[1:27:37] voice of God in this day, if it's not
[1:27:41] getting us into action, my brother, my
[1:27:43] sister, [music] there's something wrong.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong.
[1:27:49] It should be getting us into action,
[1:27:51] getting us into preparation, getting us
[1:27:54] into our position because we're getting
[1:27:57] ready to get out of here.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; When God gives us a revelation, he
[1:28:05] doesn't show us how things are going to
[1:28:07] play out.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't show Noah how it was going to
[1:28:09] play out. He just told him to get the
[1:28:11] building.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't show Abraham the things that
[1:28:15] he would go through from point A to
[1:28:17] point B. He didn't tell him how it was
[1:28:19] going to fair out, but he just said,
[1:28:20] "Hey, get out of your father's house and
[1:28:22] start journeying." So, he did. So,
[1:28:26] the word of God, revelation will get you
[1:28:29] into action.
[1:28:32] But the faith is this is the unknowing
[1:28:35] of what's going to happen or how it's
[1:28:37] going to happen. And that's when we can
[1:28:40] say, I have a revelation of this, but I
[1:28:44] don't know how it's going to happen. I
[1:28:47] have a revelation that by his stripes I
[1:28:50] am healed. I don't know when I'll be
[1:28:52] healed. I don't know how it's going to
[1:28:54] happen, but I believe it's going to
[1:28:57] happen. When it's a revelation and
[1:28:59] you've got the 25 cents in your hand,
[1:29:01] nothing else matters.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Because you're going on a journey up the
[1:29:06] mountain, through the briars, through
[1:29:08] the water, whatever it may be. The
[1:29:10] journey is the journey. And let me say
[1:29:12] this, you need to enjoy the journey.
[1:29:15] Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Because when you know that you are in
[1:29:19] the the palm of God's hands, when you
[1:29:22] realize that all things are working
[1:29:24] together for the good in your life, then
[1:29:27] you'll begin to realize, wow, the
[1:29:30] journey ain't so bad anymore.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; The briars, it ain't so bad. The
[1:29:35] mountain climbing, hey, it's okay. The
[1:29:38] waiting through the water, fine. I'm
[1:29:41] enjoying it.
[1:29:43] Why? because it's been revealed [music]
[1:29:45] to you that you're in the hands of God.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chap 11. How long do I have
[1:29:52] here?
[1:29:54] I got a few minutes.
[1:29:56] Turn with me. Hebrews 11 verse uh we
[1:30:01] could read the whole chapter, but it's
[1:30:02] 40 verses.
[1:30:04] But let's go to verse 23.
[1:30:08] By faith, Moses when he was born was
[1:30:10] head three months of his parents because
[1:30:12] they saw he was a proper child. And they
[1:30:15] were not afraid of the king's
[1:30:17] commandments. By faith. In other words,
[1:30:19] by revelation, not some unattainable
[1:30:22] thing out here. It was by a revelation
[1:30:24] that was given to him in his heart. By
[1:30:27] faith. When Moses when he come to years,
[1:30:30] he refused to be called the son of
[1:30:32] Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to
[1:30:34] suffer after with the affliction of God
[1:30:37] uh than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:30:39] for a season, esteeming the reproach of
[1:30:42] Christ greater riches
[1:30:44] than the treasures in Egypt, for he had
[1:30:46] respect onto the recompense of the
[1:30:49] reward. By faith, by revelation, he
[1:30:51] forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of
[1:30:54] the king. For he endured as seeing him
[1:30:56] who is invisible. Through faith he kept
[1:30:59] the Passover and the sprinkling of
[1:31:01] blood, lest he that destroyed the
[1:31:03] firstborn should touch them. What was he
[1:31:06] doing all these things by? Moses was
[1:31:08] living his life by revelation. Not by
[1:31:12] some unattainable faith out there. Not
[1:31:15] walking uh blindly as it were. No, he
[1:31:18] was walking according to the voice of
[1:31:20] God that God had spoke to him. He wasn't
[1:31:23] walking foolishly. He wasn't walking
[1:31:25] blindly, but he was walking by
[1:31:27] revelation to the voice of God in the
[1:31:31] hour in which he was living.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Can you put yourself there?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 35, women received their dead
[1:31:40] raised to life again.
[1:31:43] I love this part. I don't know why. And
[1:31:46] others were tortured,
[1:31:48] not accepting deliverance, that they
[1:31:50] might obtain a better resurrection. And
[1:31:52] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:31:55] scorgings. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and
[1:31:59] imprisonment. They were stoned, saw a
[1:32:01] sunder. They were tempted,
[1:32:05] were slain with the sword. They wandered
[1:32:07] about in sheep skins and goat skins,
[1:32:09] being destitute, afflicted, tormented,
[1:32:11] of whom the world was not worthy. They
[1:32:13] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:32:15] in dens and caves of the earth. All and
[1:32:18] these all having obtained a good report
[1:32:20] through faith received not the promise.
[1:32:23] God having provided some better thing
[1:32:25] for us that they without us should not
[1:32:28] be made perfect.
[1:32:31] Say well
[1:32:33] the idea that we have of faith would be
[1:32:36] how were they tormented? How how did
[1:32:38] this happen? Why were they torn us
[1:32:40] under? Why why this and why that?
[1:32:42] understand that they were walking
[1:32:45] according to faith.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; They were walking according to
[1:32:50] revelation of the revelation that God
[1:32:53] had given them. That they wouldn't bow
[1:32:56] uh uh for an easier life.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; That they wouldn't bow their knee. That
[1:33:01] they that they that they wouldn't uh uh
[1:33:04] give up the things of Christ for for for
[1:33:06] the pleasure of sin for a season. No. By
[1:33:10] revelation they lived their life. By
[1:33:14] faith they lived their life.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And therefore they were written in this
[1:33:20] wonderful chapter called the faith
[1:33:22] chapter of the Bible.
[1:33:26] But yet
[1:33:28] when we look at their lives, especially
[1:33:31] toward the end, we wonder, "Wow, this
[1:33:35] doesn't make any sense according to my
[1:33:39] concept of faith in my mind." Because
[1:33:42] the concept of faith is overcoming and
[1:33:44] strength and and and healings and
[1:33:47] deliverance and that's a part of it.
[1:33:50] But yet the part was this. They were
[1:33:53] walking according to their revelation
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; because faith is a revelation. Now let
[1:34:00] me ask you something tonight.
[1:34:03] Our lives are all different and and our
[1:34:06] [music] journey is completely different.
[1:34:09] My let me let me share with you the
[1:34:12] burden that I had for this sermon this
[1:34:15] evening was this
[1:34:17] was that you wouldn't look at your life
[1:34:20] and you wouldn't look at the journey
[1:34:22] that you're on and see the pitfalls the
[1:34:25] downfalls the briars the mountains the
[1:34:27] trials the troubles the tribulations
[1:34:29] and say to yourself and let Satan tell
[1:34:32] you that you don't have faith
[1:34:38] Because faith is a revelation. [snorts]
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And I want you to realize that you do
[1:34:44] have faith
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and your faith is strong and that the
[1:34:49] things that's going around uh uh along
[1:34:52] in your life and your journey, it
[1:34:55] doesn't necessarily have a reflection to
[1:34:58] who you are in the mind of Christ.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; That was my burden. And I hope that
[1:35:07] I hope that that burden was transferred
[1:35:11] that you realize, hey, you know what? I
[1:35:14] got faith all mixed up. Faith is
[1:35:17] attainable. Faith is steadfast. Faith is
[1:35:22] sure. I It's not in my imaginations.
[1:35:24] It's not something I got to work up. And
[1:35:26] it's not something that I have to try to
[1:35:28] attain to. It's something that God gives
[1:35:31] to me. It's a free gift of God. this
[1:35:34] revelation that I've received in this
[1:35:35] hour. Let me ask you something. Have you
[1:35:37] received the grace of God in this hour
[1:35:41] by understanding the voice that he has
[1:35:43] sent to you in this day?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:35:48] You talk about grace.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together and pray.
[1:35:56] Heavenly Father,
[1:35:59] Lord,
[1:36:01] I don't believe there's a such thing as
[1:36:04] a perfect sermon, Lord,
[1:36:07] and a little bit cut up, Lord. And but,
[1:36:10] Father God, I I'm not depending upon me,
[1:36:14] but I'm [music] depending upon you to
[1:36:15] transfer the thought, Father. And so I
[1:36:18] pray Lord that uh you would be with your
[1:36:22] children tonight and that Lord they
[1:36:24] would be encouraged that they would be
[1:36:27] encouraged by the word that they've
[1:36:28] heard Lord that that faith father is
[1:36:31] attainable and that you've given to all
[1:36:34] of us a measure of faith that we can use
[1:36:38] to get us through this life. And I want
[1:36:41] to thank you, Lord, because it is it is
