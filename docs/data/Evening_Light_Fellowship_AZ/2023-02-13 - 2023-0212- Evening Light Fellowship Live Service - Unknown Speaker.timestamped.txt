[16:07] confess he is Lord
[16:10] is there a parallel

[16:18] [Music]
[16:23] sometimes it might take circumstance
[16:26] tests

[16:43] Lord we thank you for your grace Lord
[16:45] that's made a way

[16:52] came out of your heart
[16:55] [Music]
[16:56] one day you said you're going to destroy
[16:58] all man off the Earth but a one man
[17:01] found Grace in your sight it was a
[17:04] beginning

[34:35] of a song Yesterday uh that I wrote a
[34:39] few years ago titled Fellowship
[34:41] just to and I was not sure if I should
[34:44] sing it or not and this morning trying
[34:46] to listen to a servant from the prophet
[34:49] I tried to find a sermon that they
[34:52] preached today and I realized that the
[34:54] 12th of February 56th he preached a
[34:56] sermon title Fellowship then I thought
[34:58] okay this is a confirmation we may as
[35:01] well at least say something beautifully
[35:02] but I can just quickly read for you
[35:05] oh
[35:07] if you allow me

[35:24] February 56. in the name of the Lord to
[35:27] enjoy the great time of Fellowship here

[52:22] morning thank you musicians each and
[52:24] every one I'd like you to turn with me
[52:26] two places of scripture
[52:29] turn with me to Leviticus chapter 23.
[52:34] Leviticus chapter 23
[52:37] and First Corinthians
[52:40] 15.
[52:44] we welcome all of our visitors each and
[52:47] every one got so many different ones
[52:49] here brother Robert has welcomed all of
[52:52] you so I won't take that time amen and I
[52:57] do have a board meeting directly after
[52:59] service this morning so while I'm ending
[53:02] the service some of the sisters that are
[53:06] from the board if they need to slip out
[53:09] to prepare some things
[53:11] that would be fine now this is the first
[53:14] time that I
[53:16] have ever preached on just this one
[53:19] subject
[53:21] I referred to it
[53:23] throughout some sermons
[53:27] um
[53:28] and I chances are now I've never heard
[53:31] another Minister within the message this
[53:34] is me I don't get around a whole lot and
[53:37] I don't surf the Internet to see who's
[53:39] preaching what
[53:41] I'll probably get a note from brother
[53:43] Greg Alford that he preached this back
[53:46] in 1980 uh you know brother Ron come on
[53:50] man you're you're you know you're
[53:51] catching up son so um but I I want to
[53:55] preach about the wave sheep
[53:59] and uh it's been on my heart for quite
[54:04] some time
[54:05] and so Leviticus chapter 23
[54:10] verses 10 through 16. now if you'll
[54:13] notice in Leviticus 23
[54:16] this is labeling the feasts of the Lord
[54:21] the feasts of the Lord now we all know
[54:23] that they are a type and Shadow of
[54:26] Christ himself
[54:28] for he is those Feasts he is the word so
[54:33] when you speak of the Feast of the
[54:35] Passover it's Christ when you speak
[54:38] about Feast of first fruits it's Christ
[54:40] when you speak about feasts of Pentecost
[54:44] what is it it's Christ
[54:46] Hallelujah
[54:48] and so I've got an awful lot on my uh
[54:52] Fork this morning I will try to as best
[54:56] that I can get through it all I do have
[54:59] perhaps another Sermon Just on this
[55:02] subject
[55:04] but Leviticus 23 and verse 10 it reads
[55:12] speak unto the children of Israel and
[55:15] say unto them
[55:17] when they become into the land which I
[55:19] give unto you
[55:22] and ye shall reap the Harvest thereof
[55:26] then ye shall bring a Sheaf
[55:29] of the first fruits of your Harvest unto
[55:32] the priest
[55:34] I want you to notice
[55:36] he says when you get into the land
[55:39] so now they've already crossed over
[55:42] they're into the land and he says you
[55:45] shall bring a sheep of the first fruits
[55:49] of your Harvest unto the priest
[55:52] verse 11 and he shall wave the Sheep
[55:55] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[55:59] so this wave sheath
[56:02] has come to maturity first I'll give you
[56:07] some historical events in scripture
[56:11] about this
[56:12] but the reason that it is waived and it
[56:16] was waived according to Jewish Customs
[56:19] seven times
[56:23] seven times over the field showing the
[56:27] rest of the field what they shall become
[56:32] and he shall wave the Sheaf before the
[56:35] Lord to be accepted for you on the
[56:39] morrow after the Sabbath the priests
[56:42] shall wave it
[56:44] and ye shall offer that day when you
[56:46] wave the Sheaf and he lamb without
[56:50] blemish the first year for a burnt
[56:52] offering all of these are symbols
[56:56] so we know that Christ is also the lamb
[57:01] and the meat offering thereof
[57:05] shall be two tenths deals of fine flower
[57:08] mingled with oil
[57:11] you find out this is the first time a
[57:14] double portion
[57:16] check this 210th so we see it's a double
[57:20] portion here of fine flower mingled with
[57:24] oil which also speaks of Christ
[57:29] an offering made by fire unto the Lord
[57:32] for a sweet saver
[57:34] and a drink offering shall be of wine a
[57:39] fourth part of an hen
[57:42] and ye shall eat neither bread nor
[57:45] parched corn nor green ears until the
[57:48] self same day that you brought an
[57:52] offering unto your God it shall be a
[57:55] statute forever throughout your
[57:57] Generations in all your dwellings
[58:02] verse 15 and you shall count unto you
[58:05] from the moral after the Sabbath
[58:08] from the day that you brought the Sheaf
[58:11] of the wave offering seven sabbaths
[58:14] shall be complete are we seeing a type
[58:17] here
[58:18] seven Church ages
[58:21] seven Messengers Seven Stars
[58:26] and it shall be completed
[58:29] there is a time brother Branham said
[58:31] look I no longer call you church I call
[58:34] you bright he's designating the time of
[58:38] God just dealing with the church it's
[58:41] over God is now taking even as John John
[58:45] come up hither
[58:47] and he got into the spirit amen this is
[58:51] our time this is our day this is our
[58:54] message Hallelujah
[58:59] seven sabbaths shall be completed
[59:03] even unto the morrow after the seventh
[59:06] Sabbath shall you number 50 days
[59:11] and you shall offer a new meat offering
[59:14] unto the Lord
[59:19] notice
[59:21] that this wave sheath
[59:24] actually starts a countdown to Pentecost
[59:32] First Corinthians 15.
[59:38] First Corinthians chapter 15 verses 20.
[59:43] through 23.
[59:53] and now is Christ risen from the dead
[59:57] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:00:00] slept
[1:00:02] for Since By Man Came Death
[1:00:05] by man came also the resurrection
[1:00:09] of the Dead
[1:00:12] for as in Adam all die
[1:00:17] even so in Christ shall all be made
[1:00:21] alive
[1:00:24] Hallelujah that ought to put a smile on
[1:00:26] everyone's face today
[1:00:29] notice now
[1:00:32] but every man in his owner
[1:00:36] his own order
[1:00:39] watch this
[1:00:41] Christ the first fruits
[1:00:44] afterward
[1:00:46] they that are Christ and his coming
[1:00:51] first fruits
[1:00:54] then everyone after that
[1:00:57] somebody say amen God bless you you may
[1:01:00] be seated may God add the blessing to
[1:01:02] the reading of his word you may be
[1:01:05] seated today in his presence and I pray
[1:01:09] that God will bless you richly
[1:01:12] abundantly opening to your understanding
[1:01:16] showing you another part of redemption
[1:01:20] I would like to title my sermon
[1:01:23] this morning the end time wave Sheaf
[1:01:27] has been waived over the field of
[1:01:30] laodicea
[1:01:33] I take a subject then
[1:01:36] the first one to come to maturity
[1:01:39] becomes the wave Sheaf
[1:01:43] I've always wanted to preach a sermon on
[1:01:45] the wave chief of the Old Testament
[1:01:50] and it's very interesting as I
[1:01:54] began to actually study this a couple
[1:01:56] days ago
[1:01:59] I began to not only research it through
[1:02:02] the scripture but I went to the message
[1:02:04] of the hour
[1:02:06] and I found out that he only preaches
[1:02:09] about the wave Chief in one sermon
[1:02:12] one sermon
[1:02:15] he gives about seven or eight quotes in
[1:02:18] one sermon about the wave sheep
[1:02:21] that is in the in the sermon it is the
[1:02:25] rising of the Sun
[1:02:28] and he allures to we're not talking
[1:02:31] about the s-u-n
[1:02:34] we're talking about the s-o-n
[1:02:38] and he's actually declaring there's a
[1:02:42] rising
[1:02:43] of a son of man Ministry what it is it's
[1:02:47] the son of man this is the day when the
[1:02:49] son of man shall rise with healing in
[1:02:53] his wings he shall bring you back to an
[1:02:56] inheritance that which Adam lost this
[1:03:00] second Adam Christ is returning you back
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:04] [Applause]
[1:03:05] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] so all of these quotes I'm only going to
[1:03:12] use a few of them we will sprinkle them
[1:03:15] throughout the sermon
[1:03:18] and the first one in 1965
[1:03:24] paragraph 81.
[1:03:26] I'd like to read a little scripture here
[1:03:29] for you
[1:03:31] I'd like for you to turn in the
[1:03:33] scripture I got it wrote down here I'm
[1:03:35] might help you a little has found the
[1:03:38] Book of Leviticus the 23rd chapter the
[1:03:42] 9th to the 11th verse listen close
[1:03:46] in the law levitical law God speaking to
[1:03:50] Moses listen
[1:03:51] all these things are types now
[1:03:55] and we'll stop here for a few minutes to
[1:03:58] get into this type
[1:04:00] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:04:03] Speak unto the children of Israel
[1:04:05] saying unto them when you come into the
[1:04:07] land which I've given you
[1:04:09] now watch he immediately goes to placing
[1:04:12] and positioning
[1:04:15] verse paragraph 82 under the place the
[1:04:19] position that I have given unto you I
[1:04:24] want all of you to know that each one of
[1:04:27] you are given a particular place and a
[1:04:32] position in the body of Christ there is
[1:04:36] none of you without exception
[1:04:39] but you must know and recognize your day
[1:04:43] and its message and when you recognize
[1:04:46] that you're actually understanding what
[1:04:50] position you play and where you're
[1:04:52] placed in that body
[1:04:55] Hallelujah
[1:04:58] now you speak to the children of it and
[1:05:02] when you get to this certain place that
[1:05:04] I promise you I take you
[1:05:08] when you get there in this land yeah now
[1:05:11] speaking natural here typing the
[1:05:14] spiritual
[1:05:16] and shall reap the Harvest thereof if
[1:05:18] you have received what I told you
[1:05:20] thereof
[1:05:21] then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first
[1:05:24] fruits of your Harvest unto the Lord and
[1:05:28] He Shall wave the Sheep before the Lord
[1:05:31] to be accepted for you
[1:05:34] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[1:05:38] priest shall wave it now let me just for
[1:05:41] a moment
[1:05:43] give a little background and I probably
[1:05:46] will refer to this in my next sermon
[1:05:50] but all of the feasts of Jehovah that
[1:05:53] are found in Leviticus 23.
[1:05:57] they are all shadows and types of Christ
[1:06:02] you can see it down through the
[1:06:05] scriptures
[1:06:07] and in ancient Israel to give you a
[1:06:10] little historical background
[1:06:15] the beginning of the Harvest of the
[1:06:18] grain
[1:06:19] and the waving of the first Chief that
[1:06:22] came to maturity was to be accepted by
[1:06:24] God
[1:06:26] as the first fruits of the Harvest crop
[1:06:31] this simple wave sheep has I want to say
[1:06:34] to you of great
[1:06:37] spiritual
[1:06:39] significance it is not a holy day
[1:06:44] it is not one of the feasts
[1:06:47] but I want to say this
[1:06:50] that although it may look obscure
[1:06:54] and a little bit in the background
[1:06:57] but without
[1:06:59] the wave sheath taking place none of the
[1:07:04] rest could happen
[1:07:06] why because God said you take the first
[1:07:10] fruit and you wave it over the field he
[1:07:14] said no one can go into Harvest nobody
[1:07:17] can eat of the grain nobody can do it
[1:07:20] until I see one that's come to maturity
[1:07:23] first Hallelujah so this is and may I
[1:07:28] say this that when you understand that
[1:07:32] the time clock to Pentecost
[1:07:35] it began to count down why oh my God
[1:07:38] help me preach this morning when you
[1:07:41] began to see the shadows and types in
[1:07:44] the scriptures when you begin to see
[1:07:46] brother Brown said God will open up your
[1:07:48] eyes of understanding and your Bible
[1:07:50] becomes a new Bible Hallelujah
[1:07:59] it's so easily Overlook the wave sheep
[1:08:02] offering
[1:08:04] only those aware
[1:08:07] of this wave sheep
[1:08:09] actually realize there's a countdown
[1:08:12] that begins to Pentecost
[1:08:15] it's only this only occurs one day a
[1:08:19] year
[1:08:20] the day of the wave sheath offering is
[1:08:23] not designated a holy day by God
[1:08:29] but it's far
[1:08:32] more important to you than you believe
[1:08:36] without its significance
[1:08:40] as to our Salvation
[1:08:43] there would be no salvation without the
[1:08:47] first fruits of a wave sheep
[1:08:55] the agricultural cycle of ancient Israel
[1:09:01] revolved around two harvests
[1:09:04] one was the spring Harvest and the other
[1:09:06] was an Autumn Harvest
[1:09:09] but before any grain could be harvested
[1:09:11] in the spring and unusual ceremony took
[1:09:16] place to inaugurate
[1:09:18] the spring harvest season
[1:09:22] what is the significance of this
[1:09:25] ceremony
[1:09:27] Jesus Christ being the first fruits
[1:09:31] of those who have fallen asleep it is
[1:09:34] the first sheep of grain that is called
[1:09:37] the first fruits in Leviticus 23 and 10.
[1:09:40] it was the firstfruits of The Barley
[1:09:43] Harvest
[1:09:45] the first of the grain that come to
[1:09:48] maturity
[1:09:50] and then we could fast forward to
[1:09:53] thousands of years later after they had
[1:09:56] been celebrating the wave Chief and and
[1:09:59] they've been celebrating the feasts of
[1:10:02] the Lord thousands of years later we see
[1:10:05] the same terminology being used and
[1:10:09] designated to Christ he is called the
[1:10:13] first fruits he is called the firstborn
[1:10:18] you see he is the firstborn from the
[1:10:22] dead he is the first to rise
[1:10:25] Hallelujah so what is the connection
[1:10:27] between the first grain offering called
[1:10:30] the first fruits and Jesus Christ the
[1:10:34] first fruits and first born from the
[1:10:36] dead this understanding will tie all of
[1:10:40] the elements of the two harvests
[1:10:43] mentioned earlier in the Feast of
[1:10:46] Pentecost
[1:10:48] oh my God
[1:10:50] and then to observe 50 days later the
[1:10:55] conclusion
[1:10:57] of that which began with the wave sheath
[1:11:01] it will finish
[1:11:03] with
[1:11:05] a release
[1:11:09] it's a jubilee
[1:11:11] 50.
[1:11:13] is it you believe
[1:11:19] Hallelujah
[1:11:21] seven Church ages
[1:11:24] Seven Seals
[1:11:26] seven trumpets
[1:11:28] all of these things are only a type and
[1:11:33] Shadow
[1:11:34] of what's Happening even in this day God
[1:11:37] give us an understanding
[1:11:41] so the observance of the wave sheath
[1:11:44] concludes
[1:11:45] 50 days later
[1:11:48] and ends with the final Harvest
[1:11:55] Pentecost
[1:11:57] was the harvesting of the rest of the
[1:12:01] grain
[1:12:02] it is called the final Harvest
[1:12:10] now we can clearly see
[1:12:13] that the same thing happens again in the
[1:12:15] days of Christ
[1:12:18] Jesus Christ became the wave Sheaf
[1:12:22] that was cut down at Calvary
[1:12:25] only to be raised up
[1:12:27] in the resurrection and waved over the
[1:12:30] field
[1:12:31] I want to tell you who raised him up God
[1:12:35] raised him up here was the wave sheath
[1:12:40] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:46] no man takes my life
[1:12:49] I lay it down for my sheep
[1:12:52] and where I go you're gonna be with me
[1:12:54] and when I do you're gonna do and the
[1:12:57] same baptism I got you're gonna give
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:08] that started the time clock for another
[1:13:10] Harvest to take place 50 days later
[1:13:14] Jesus Christ was the wave offering over
[1:13:18] the elect to show them also that they
[1:13:21] too will become manifested sons of God
[1:13:28] on the day of Pentecost it was the
[1:13:30] harvesting of the seed again
[1:13:32] Jesus Christ harvested watch this when
[1:13:35] he rose he harvested all of the Old
[1:13:39] Testament Saints he gathered with him
[1:13:42] can you say Amen what was he doing
[1:13:45] harvesting seed Hallelujah and he was
[1:13:49] he went down into hell
[1:13:52] lift up your head so ye gates huh for
[1:13:56] the Lord is called who is this Lord of
[1:13:59] Lord
[1:14:01] who is it
[1:14:03] the Lord Of Glory Mighty in battle let
[1:14:06] me tell you my brother my sister we have
[1:14:10] just begin to fight in this end time we
[1:14:14] shall overcome and we shall possess the
[1:14:18] Gate of every enemy
[1:14:21] hey
[1:14:22] hey you have an inheritance
[1:14:25] you have a promise
[1:14:27] Hallelujah
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:34] the Holy Spirit watch this now
[1:14:38] release the power
[1:14:41] unto the New Testament Saints
[1:14:45] so God harvesting Old Testament
[1:14:49] and releasing them
[1:14:52] but now the holy spirit's releasing
[1:14:55] power
[1:14:56] to New Testament Saints
[1:15:00] my
[1:15:04] on Pentecost we're taking back now to
[1:15:07] the Feast of Pentecost
[1:15:10] there was offered from the first fruits
[1:15:13] of the wheat Harvest
[1:15:15] which followed seven
[1:15:18] several weeks after the barley Harvest
[1:15:23] and it there were two Harvest periods
[1:15:29] though two periods of physical
[1:15:32] harvesting in ancient Israel
[1:15:36] and I want you to catch this in your
[1:15:39] spiritual understanding
[1:15:43] in God's great plan for salvation of
[1:15:45] humanity
[1:15:47] this astounding truth
[1:15:51] is shown through the symbolism of the
[1:15:54] wave sheep first
[1:15:56] and then at the day of Pentecost
[1:16:01] now in the scriptures we see many types
[1:16:04] and shadows of this
[1:16:06] but I only want to take a few
[1:16:09] to rehearse in your ears
[1:16:12] this morning
[1:16:14] now the waves heave consisted
[1:16:17] of an Omer of barley that's a measure of
[1:16:21] barley
[1:16:22] it was still on the stock
[1:16:26] and it was cut down at the beginning of
[1:16:30] the spring Harvest
[1:16:32] since it came from the very beginning of
[1:16:35] the Harvest of first fruits
[1:16:37] it is called the first
[1:16:40] of the first fruits according to Exodus
[1:16:43] 23 verse 19.
[1:16:46] now
[1:16:47] I also did some study about this wave
[1:16:51] Sheaf
[1:16:52] and found out in the book of Exodus
[1:16:56] chapter 23 and chapter 34 Leviticus 23.
[1:17:01] and Nehemiah chapter 12.
[1:17:05] that it was a
[1:17:08] a commandment given to each Israelite
[1:17:13] possessing a harvest
[1:17:16] was required to give God
[1:17:20] an offering
[1:17:22] and then that priest then lifted or
[1:17:25] waved each Sheaf before
[1:17:29] God for acceptance
[1:17:32] it was to signify that the rest of the
[1:17:35] field
[1:17:37] will become exactly as the wave sheath
[1:17:43] listen to me
[1:17:45] it signified for your account
[1:17:50] that you shall become
[1:17:53] what the wave sheath became
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:17:59] and so listen to this because however
[1:18:02] the individual Israelite Farmers used to
[1:18:07] bring each one of their own little wave
[1:18:10] Sheaf
[1:18:11] but we find out during the time of the
[1:18:14] second temple
[1:18:16] what it was is the high priest went out
[1:18:18] himself into the field
[1:18:20] Hallelujah he gathered because there is
[1:18:24] a part of the field every farmer knows
[1:18:26] this that though you plant acres and
[1:18:29] Acres of some kind of seed there'll be a
[1:18:33] portion of that field that will for some
[1:18:36] unknown reason
[1:18:37] it comes to maturity first
[1:18:40] and the high priest walks out into that
[1:18:43] field Hallelujah he begins to look for
[1:18:47] fruit of a matured field he begins to
[1:18:51] look for that grain that has come to its
[1:18:55] maturity brother Branham said it's not
[1:18:57] arrogant it's not boastful it's proud he
[1:19:01] said it when you are full of the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost and knowledge of God you bow your
[1:19:08] head in humility
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:12] this high priest then came and he cut
[1:19:16] down a stalk a portion of this he called
[1:19:19] it a sheep and he took that he bounded
[1:19:22] together and he took it seven times he
[1:19:26] waved it over the congregation he waved
[1:19:29] it over the field for them to realize
[1:19:33] Hallelujah that there is an example of
[1:19:37] the example Hallelujah can you say we've
[1:19:40] had an example in this day
[1:19:42] [Applause]
[1:19:46] now watch
[1:19:49] the wave sheave actually sets the stage
[1:19:54] it sets a precedent
[1:19:56] for what the rest of the Harvest
[1:20:00] will become
[1:20:03] in fact
[1:20:05] according to levitical law
[1:20:08] the Harvest could not actually begin to
[1:20:11] fully ripen
[1:20:13] until the wave sheep offering occurred
[1:20:24] those scriptures specifies the day
[1:20:28] for the wave sheep
[1:20:31] to be cut there was no specific time
[1:20:34] for it to be cut
[1:20:36] now I'm going to Jewish history now to
[1:20:40] substantiate something
[1:20:42] during the time of the second
[1:20:44] Temple it's very interesting to note
[1:20:48] that the sickle of the high priest that
[1:20:52] cut the grain was just as the sun was
[1:20:56] going down on their weekly Sabbath
[1:21:06] showing how Christ our first fruits
[1:21:09] of the Harvest was cut down the evening
[1:21:13] they were in a hurry why Sabbath was
[1:21:16] coming
[1:21:17] do you see he was cut down in the
[1:21:20] evening
[1:21:21] Hallelujah
[1:21:25] now the Bible nowhere indicates
[1:21:29] that the priests fully understood
[1:21:33] the ritual they were performing
[1:21:36] on Saturday would be a precedent
[1:21:40] for the final Harvest
[1:21:46] on Sunday morning as the firstborn of
[1:21:49] many Brethren he was lifted into the
[1:21:51] heavens
[1:21:54] to God's Throne to be accepted
[1:21:59] for you
[1:22:02] as a sacrifice for your sins
[1:22:10] Christ was a
[1:22:12] first seed grain
[1:22:16] to become ripened
[1:22:19] he was the first one to come maturity
[1:22:22] he was a fully adopted son
[1:22:28] this is exactly corresponding now
[1:22:32] throughout several places in the
[1:22:34] scripture I'm going to refer to it
[1:22:36] though later we may read
[1:22:39] how about the time of Boaz and Ruth
[1:22:44] they came together events transpired
[1:22:51] at the time of The Barley Harvest
[1:22:54] and Boaz is known of the king of harvest
[1:23:00] the offering which was waived according
[1:23:03] to Leviticus 7 30.
[1:23:06] was the most likely a small Sheaf of
[1:23:09] barley
[1:23:11] the grain which is the first to ripen
[1:23:16] then was to be offered later in the
[1:23:19] loaves at Pentecost
[1:23:22] so the two offerings show here watch
[1:23:25] this
[1:23:26] Stay With Me Now for a moment
[1:23:28] the two offerings show one at the
[1:23:31] beginning of the Harvest
[1:23:32] and the other at the end of harvest
[1:23:36] let me show you this in the scripture
[1:23:39] Ruth 1 verse 22.
[1:23:42] so Naomi returned and Ruth the moabitus
[1:23:47] her daughter-in-law with her
[1:23:50] returned under the country of Moab
[1:23:53] and they came to Bethlehem in the
[1:23:56] beginning of the barley Harvest
[1:24:02] this was the first fruits
[1:24:06] so it is at the time of the wave sheath
[1:24:09] being waved over the fields
[1:24:13] in fact was it not in the field of Boaz
[1:24:17] that Naomi has told we have a kinsman
[1:24:21] redeemer
[1:24:23] and I want you to go and I want you to
[1:24:26] glean in his field
[1:24:29] the handfuls of blessings she is
[1:24:32] gleaning
[1:24:36] is after the first fruits
[1:24:39] in fact it's commanded leave handfuls
[1:24:43] for those that will come into that field
[1:24:47] later and hear I'll tell you it just
[1:24:50] Thrills my heart
[1:24:52] she winds up getting handfuls of
[1:24:54] blessings she gets oh she gets a portion
[1:24:59] she comes back to Naomi Naomi goes my
[1:25:02] where did you get this
[1:25:05] oh my she says there was one his name is
[1:25:09] Boaz
[1:25:10] Hallelujah and she Roots fell on her
[1:25:15] face
[1:25:16] before Boaz it says why do you speak so
[1:25:20] kindly to me a stranger
[1:25:23] because it has been told me and fully
[1:25:27] revealed go read it in your Bible it's
[1:25:30] been fully revealed to me that thou art
[1:25:33] highly favored and God wants to give you
[1:25:37] a reward of the House of Israel
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:44] oh yeah
[1:25:49] She lays herself down you know the story
[1:25:54] at the end
[1:25:56] because Naomi says the same one
[1:25:59] he's your Kinsman
[1:26:02] and I want you to find where he's
[1:26:04] working
[1:26:06] because he's down in the threshing floor
[1:26:10] she goes down finds him She lays At His
[1:26:12] Feet assign him possession
[1:26:16] covers herself
[1:26:19] With His Garment
[1:26:21] oh yeah he waits who art thou
[1:26:25] I am thy handmaid
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:38] and he tells her he says
[1:26:40] I shall truly perform
[1:26:44] the work of a kinsman redeemer you stay
[1:26:48] here until the rising
[1:26:53] of the Sun
[1:26:55] and when you see the sun rising
[1:27:03] are you catching the types and the
[1:27:05] Shadows
[1:27:07] Ruth 20 excuse me Ruth chapter 2 verse
[1:27:10] 23.
[1:27:13] she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz
[1:27:16] to glean onto the end
[1:27:20] of barley Harvest and of wheat Harvest
[1:27:23] and to dwell with her mother-in-law so
[1:27:25] we see the beginning of the Harvest
[1:27:27] and the end of harvest
[1:27:30] to harvest are you catching it
[1:27:33] amen Ruth cleans in the field of Boaz
[1:27:37] and finds her handfuls of blessings that
[1:27:40] are left over from the first harvest
[1:27:42] when we understand the types and shadows
[1:27:44] of what happens with Ruth we'll
[1:27:46] understand what's happening with us now
[1:27:49] Ruth are you listening Ruth are you here
[1:27:52] do you understand stay here At His Feet
[1:27:56] stay where he tells you to stay stay in
[1:27:59] the promised word of the hour

[1:28:13] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:28:16] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:28:19] the sons of God
[1:28:21] all of nature is groaning
[1:28:25] it's in travail brother Brennan preaches
[1:28:27] birth pains and he says what is the
[1:28:30] world this world wanting what is it
[1:28:32] looking for manifestation of the sons of
[1:28:36] God are you listening Sons understand
[1:28:39] that this world is wanting to be
[1:28:43] delivered and it can't be delivered
[1:28:45] until God manifests his sons on the
[1:28:49] Earth
[1:28:49] [Applause]
[1:28:53] for the creature was made subject to
[1:28:55] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:28:59] him hath subjected the same in Hope
[1:29:02] because the creature itself also shall
[1:29:05] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:29:07] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:29:11] the children of God for we know that the
[1:29:15] whole creation growneth and travaleth in
[1:29:18] pain together until now
[1:29:23] and not only they
[1:29:25] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:29:29] fruits of the spirit amen you catch his
[1:29:32] first fruits watch it's always type
[1:29:34] Shadows
[1:29:37] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:29:41] waiting for the adoption to Wed the
[1:29:45] Redemption of our body
[1:29:48] there must be in this day then a return
[1:29:52] to the church another wave Sheaf
[1:29:56] before there can be releasing of a bride
[1:30:00] in an end time Harvest
[1:30:02] there has to be a wave sheep over the
[1:30:05] field
[1:30:06] at the beginning of harvest season
[1:30:09] and then a second
[1:30:15] the wave sheep was a sign
[1:30:18] that God was giving it to the rest of
[1:30:21] the field follow along with me it is the
[1:30:24] rising of the Sun
[1:30:27] notice it was the first corn of God's
[1:30:31] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[1:30:34] God's first corn of wheat by God's
[1:30:38] quickening power God had quickened his
[1:30:42] life raised him up from the dead he was
[1:30:45] the first fruits of those that slept the
[1:30:49] first fruit he was that Chief
[1:30:53] that's why they had to wave that chief
[1:30:57] for it was the first one to come to
[1:31:00] maturity
[1:31:01] and it was waived as a memorial of
[1:31:04] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[1:31:08] rest of them would come it was a sign
[1:31:12] Hallelujah the wave sheep is a sign
[1:31:16] are you understanding
[1:31:19] that when Christ was raised up it was
[1:31:22] assigned to the rest of the field this
[1:31:25] is what you shall become what I am you
[1:31:28] will be the works that I do shall you do
[1:31:32] also where I go you'll be there with me
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:38] praise
[1:31:41] thank you
[1:31:44] Christ our high priest has waved another
[1:31:46] sheep over the end of this Gentile
[1:31:49] dispensation
[1:31:51] the wave sheep waved over the field of
[1:31:54] this loud you see an age
[1:31:57] Prophet first one to come to spiritual
[1:32:00] maturity
[1:32:03] his ministry was waived over the world
[1:32:07] seven times
[1:32:10] testifying to this age what spiritual
[1:32:13] maturity looked like
[1:32:16] the way of sheep was weighed by the high
[1:32:18] priest seven times over the field
[1:32:21] watch what he says 1960
[1:32:25] he says I'm just going to read the
[1:32:27] highlighted portion how he would send me
[1:32:30] out in the field the field is the world
[1:32:34] seven times
[1:32:36] around the world
[1:32:38] how would he do that and let millions of
[1:32:42] souls be won if I didn't have some side
[1:32:45] of connection conception of truth how
[1:32:49] would he let me do these things the
[1:32:50] signs that he said he would send in the
[1:32:53] last days
[1:32:55] and we've never ever seen them or read
[1:32:58] them in history before since the Days of
[1:33:01] Our Lord
[1:33:02] why would he let me bring a message like
[1:33:05] this
[1:33:06] if I'm wrong
[1:33:08] he will never bless a lie
[1:33:11] he lets me bring it because I preached
[1:33:14] this is the truth this is the way
[1:33:18] Hallelujah if you believe me to be God's
[1:33:21] prophet
[1:33:22] I don't say that of myself
[1:33:30] he became me fully manifested son and
[1:33:34] adopted son
[1:33:40] he was knighted
[1:33:43] into his position
[1:33:47] at Sabino Canyon
[1:33:50] the sword was placed into his head he
[1:33:53] thought his ministry was over
[1:33:56] it was not over it was just starting
[1:33:59] his ministry was Rising
[1:34:03] the crowds were fewer
[1:34:07] but the ministry was greater
[1:34:11] God does this for a purpose he sends the
[1:34:14] chef the Chuck why it's the threshing
[1:34:18] floor
[1:34:19] and then there in sunset Mountain
[1:34:24] he's raised up into a cloud
[1:34:27] he's under the influence of seven Mighty
[1:34:30] Angels Wings swept back powerful Angel
[1:34:34] they came from eternity how elujah he
[1:34:38] sat there I was caught up into a
[1:34:41] consolation of angels
[1:34:44] but a sign
[1:34:46] what is it it's a wave sheath caught up
[1:34:50] caught up before oh he said they checked
[1:34:54] a picture of it we didn't do it
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:35:01] notice the title of this sermon it is
[1:35:03] the rising of the sun if there would be
[1:35:07] any holy ritual
[1:35:09] it should come forth on the Sabbath day
[1:35:12] which is the seventh day of the week
[1:35:14] which is Saturday but did you notice in
[1:35:17] this Memorial
[1:35:18] to wave it on the first day of the week
[1:35:21] the Sheep which was the first of your
[1:35:25] seed that you planted when it comes up
[1:35:28] and ripen you cut down the Sheaf and
[1:35:32] take it to the priest and let him take
[1:35:35] it and wave it before the Lord for your
[1:35:37] accept exception
[1:35:39] that you are accepted
[1:35:42] you have come with your sheath and he is
[1:35:46] to wave it before the Lord not on the
[1:35:49] Sabbath the seventh day but on the first
[1:35:52] day which we shall call Sunday then he
[1:35:55] s-u-n-d-a-y
[1:35:58] he says what it's not Sun s-u-n anymore
[1:36:07] s-o-n-d-a-y what is it
[1:36:09] not a man he's now changing his ministry
[1:36:14] and yet the brother Brenham said is it
[1:36:16] so hard for you to understand I'm a son
[1:36:19] of man but I'm revealing to you the son
[1:36:23] of man it's not me that does each works
[1:36:26] it's him
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:29] foreign
[1:36:38] it's the s-o-n-d-a-y
[1:36:41] the Sunday
[1:36:42] that that corn of wheat God's first one
[1:36:45] up from the dead is to be waived over
[1:36:47] the congregation
[1:36:49] that we are his seed
[1:36:53] and that's the first seed of those that
[1:36:55] slept waved upon the first day of the
[1:36:58] week on Sunny he raised up waved goodbye
[1:37:01] let's send it up on high in the presence
[1:37:03] of the people
[1:37:10] is this not the Fulfillment of Luke
[1:37:13] chapter 17.
[1:37:15] as it was in the days of Noah as it was
[1:37:19] in the days of lot
[1:37:21] wherein the son of man shall be revealed
[1:37:25] Hallelujah
[1:37:27] this is the son of man Ministry
[1:37:30] according to Luke 17 30. brother Branham
[1:37:34] said this day is this scripture
[1:37:36] fulfilled it's not brother Branham
[1:37:39] listen to me it was not brother Branham
[1:37:42] doing these Works he was a fully
[1:37:45] manifested son and it's the word that
[1:37:48] third pool which is the word revealed in
[1:37:51] its season and he says when it's
[1:37:53] revealed he could not stop it it was
[1:37:57] emanating from him nature sought the the
[1:38:00] possum sought the deer saw it even
[1:38:04] though the people missed it but nature
[1:38:07] even nature was saying are you Adam are
[1:38:11] you the one you pray for me you speak to
[1:38:14] me you tell me I'll be all right you lay
[1:38:17] on the doorstep for three days and the
[1:38:20] prophet missed it but the holy spirit
[1:38:22] said aren't you catching it
[1:38:25] that little animal has waited for you to
[1:38:28] pray for it
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:35] here is a manifested son
[1:38:38] coming into his fullness of adoption
[1:38:42] to where when he speaks he creates
[1:38:45] when he speaks storms go back
[1:38:51] when he speaks diseases go away when he
[1:38:56] speaks children got to come forth
[1:39:04] come on
[1:39:07] he can't
[1:39:11] happening
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:20] because the son of man is Christ
[1:39:24] anointed once at the end time watch this
[1:39:28] you might have thought today I was
[1:39:30] trying to say that about myself
[1:39:32] being that I was packing this message
[1:39:37] I have no more to do with it than
[1:39:39] nothing
[1:39:40] no more than a voice
[1:39:43] and my voice against my own better
[1:39:45] judgment I wanted to be a Trapper
[1:39:47] but it's the will of my father
[1:39:51] that I declare to do and determine to do
[1:39:53] hold that thought there for just a
[1:39:56] moment
[1:39:57] brother Branham says you know
[1:39:59] what this third poll it means that I
[1:40:01] there's a whole lot of shaking there's a
[1:40:04] whole lot of death to self and he says
[1:40:08] and I I I I can't go back to for first
[1:40:11] and second pull it's over and he says uh
[1:40:15] but he was determined to do the will and
[1:40:18] just as Jesus said let this cup pass
[1:40:21] from me nevertheless let thy will be
[1:40:24] done when brother Branham now listen to
[1:40:27] me here is the wave Chief in this day
[1:40:30] realizing
[1:40:31] that he's going to be excommunicated
[1:40:34] from all of the church's doors are going
[1:40:37] to close people are going to call him an
[1:40:39] antichrist all kinds of things
[1:40:46] and he made a decision
[1:40:49] I'll go the hard way
[1:40:52] I actually wanted to choose to to maybe
[1:40:55] title the sermon choosing the harder way
[1:40:59] foreign
[1:41:00] understand every one of you just as he
[1:41:03] had to choose the harder way
[1:41:06] and remember when it came out in French
[1:41:09] three is a witness
[1:41:11] he had just made this choice
[1:41:15] I'll go with him the harder way
[1:41:18] I don't care what men say I don't care
[1:41:21] what people think I'm gonna go with him
[1:41:24] I've chosen the harder way
[1:41:27] and God letting his Prophet know
[1:41:31] here it comes with three interpretations
[1:41:34] because thou has chosen the harder way
[1:41:37] which is my way
[1:41:40] a great reward
[1:41:42] a great portion of Heaven awaits you
[1:41:52] he says
[1:41:55] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:41:57] the river
[1:41:58] I was only standing there when he
[1:42:01] appeared
[1:42:02] I'm not the one that performs these
[1:42:04] things four tells these things it
[1:42:06] happens as perfect as they are I'm only
[1:42:09] one that's near when he does it
[1:42:12] I was only a voice that he used
[1:42:15] to say it
[1:42:16] it wasn't what I knew
[1:42:18] it's just what I surrendered
[1:42:23] myself too
[1:42:25] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:42:27] wasn't the seventh angel oh no
[1:42:30] it was a manifestation of the son of man
[1:42:37] it was the it wasn't the angel his
[1:42:40] message it was the mystery of God
[1:42:42] unfolded
[1:42:44] it's not a man it's God
[1:42:47] the son of man is Christ
[1:42:50] he's the one that you're feeding on
[1:42:53] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:42:57] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:43:01] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:43:04] man this was not William branham's
[1:43:07] message this was the message that came
[1:43:10] from almighty God himself
[1:43:16] oh man amen amen I had a disagreement
[1:43:21] with Brother Joseph when he came out and
[1:43:23] said
[1:43:24] this message is copyrighted and anybody
[1:43:27] that copies it or anything like that
[1:43:31] it's stolen bread
[1:43:34] you remember the
[1:43:36] the little booklet here I stand
[1:43:40] I told him I said
[1:43:42] since when can the word of God be
[1:43:44] copyrighted
[1:43:47] I said if this was your father's message
[1:43:50] you have every right for every royalty
[1:43:53] but I said change the name
[1:43:56] it ain't the voice of God
[1:43:58] it's the voice of William Branham and
[1:44:00] you can get every royalty and you can
[1:44:02] charge so much money and you can become
[1:44:05] rich
[1:44:07] I said but you better change the name
[1:44:10] I said because the name itself the voice
[1:44:12] of God I said how dare you think that
[1:44:16] you can copyright
[1:44:18] the voice of God
[1:44:20] these messages began to listen Roy
[1:44:23] borders gave out millions and millions
[1:44:27] of books free of charge Amen to people
[1:44:31] all over the world in fact when they
[1:44:33] started making tapes brother Brown said
[1:44:36] if these men who make these states start
[1:44:38] making money I'll take it away from them
[1:44:40] he said if you can't afford to have a
[1:44:43] tape he said I'll give it to you free
[1:44:47] Hallelujah you can't copyright what God
[1:44:50] has put his label on
[1:44:53] [Applause]
[1:44:55] yes
[1:44:59] I know that's not popular
[1:45:01] but that's okay
[1:45:04] now
[1:45:07] I believe
[1:45:09] that God is working amongst the church
[1:45:13] globally right now it's not just here
[1:45:17] local don't think that it's just us
[1:45:22] and God is it's just our little no when
[1:45:26] you begin to look around the world you
[1:45:28] will see God is doing something
[1:45:29] internationally globally he's doing it
[1:45:33] in Africa he's doing it in India he's
[1:45:36] doing it in all the different countries
[1:45:38] around the world what is it God is
[1:45:41] orchestrating a final move why because
[1:45:44] the wave sheep has been waived over the
[1:45:47] congregation and there's coming another
[1:45:49] Harvest
[1:45:50] [Applause]
[1:45:53] thank you
[1:45:58] it's the chef have you noticed
[1:46:01] in the last several years the different
[1:46:03] ones and this one going away that one
[1:46:06] going away this pastor and that Pastor
[1:46:08] in this congregation and this person
[1:46:13] what is it
[1:46:15] the shock
[1:46:17] this is not air with the weed
[1:46:22] do you know that at the time of the
[1:46:24] Harvest
[1:46:25] after the wave chief
[1:46:28] has been given and they begin to harvest
[1:46:30] the field
[1:46:32] then it's the time of the threshing
[1:46:34] floor
[1:46:38] if you've been into some of the poorer
[1:46:40] countries
[1:46:42] I've been to Africa I've been to India
[1:46:45] I've seen oxen treading the wheat
[1:46:49] going around in a circle they put their
[1:46:51] sheaves there and they do it what is it
[1:46:54] I've seen it in India where they didn't
[1:46:57] even have the ability to separate the
[1:47:00] wheat they had no way to do the term so
[1:47:02] what they would do is put their wheat on
[1:47:05] the the on the road and as the car would
[1:47:08] go by it would put the pressure of the
[1:47:10] tires over it and then as it went by
[1:47:13] speeding by they began to separate the
[1:47:16] chaff from the wheat and they would go
[1:47:18] out there and gather the grain oh I've
[1:47:21] been in Canada I've rode in the great
[1:47:23] combines where they sit there and they
[1:47:26] combine it just sits here and it's
[1:47:28] cutting it off and it puts it all
[1:47:30] together and but before Hallelujah if
[1:47:33] you've ever followed the combine there's
[1:47:36] something from behind it what's
[1:47:38] happening as the grain goes up and
[1:47:40] before it goes into the bin it has the
[1:47:43] roughest time of its life
[1:47:46] why do you think it's so hard right now
[1:47:49] God is taking the shot he's taking the
[1:47:53] chef that's in your life he's rubbing it
[1:47:56] together he's beating it
[1:48:00] and before the grain can go into the
[1:48:03] hopper he goes through a time of
[1:48:06] turbulence it's a separation time this
[1:48:10] is the threshing floor time this is God
[1:48:13] did not John the Baptist said his hand
[1:48:17] his fan is in his hand and he's
[1:48:21] thoroughly purging the floor
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:24] four
[1:48:27] four five
[1:48:29] first Peter 4 verse 17 and 18.
[1:48:34] for the time has come
[1:48:37] the Judgment must begin at the house of
[1:48:40] God
[1:48:41] threshing florist judgment
[1:48:45] threshing floor
[1:48:47] is the type of the house of God
[1:48:50] is Thoroughly purging his threshing for
[1:48:54] it's a time of judgment in turmoil
[1:48:58] when you thresh the wheat you beat it
[1:49:03] you tread it with oxen
[1:49:07] they do whatever it takes to cause a
[1:49:10] separation
[1:49:13] God will use bad things
[1:49:16] to produce good
[1:49:19] because the Bible says in Romans 8 28
[1:49:21] for all things somebody say all things
[1:49:26] we'll work together for the good who are
[1:49:29] the called according to his purpose are
[1:49:32] you cold then everything that comes
[1:49:35] across your path
[1:49:38] will God use it then for his glory
[1:49:45] didn't say it would be good
[1:49:49] but it'll produce good
[1:49:54] Hallelujah
[1:49:56] church is on the threshing floor right
[1:49:58] now John 3 verses 16 and 17 John
[1:50:02] answered I indeed baptize you with water
[1:50:04] but one mightier than I cometh the
[1:50:07] latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
[1:50:09] to unloose and he shall baptize you with
[1:50:11] the Holy Ghost in fire whose fan is in
[1:50:14] his hand and he will thoroughly Purge
[1:50:17] his floor and will gather the weed into
[1:50:19] the Garner
[1:50:20] the chef will burn with on fire
[1:50:23] unquenchable
[1:50:24] God
[1:50:26] Purge those things out of our lives that
[1:50:30] are not like him
[1:50:32] how many of you are willing to say God
[1:50:34] Purge me
[1:50:36] show me in my life the things that are
[1:50:38] not
[1:50:44] same thing's happening today
[1:50:50] God is purging the church right now
[1:50:54] there's such a thing as doing God a
[1:50:56] service without it being his will
[1:50:58] David placed the word of God upon a new
[1:51:01] car the prophet of God said it looked
[1:51:03] like a real Revival
[1:51:05] he danced before the ark he did all of
[1:51:07] that the trumpets and they sounded in
[1:51:09] the temporals
[1:51:11] and he says but then when the oxen came
[1:51:15] the Bible says
[1:51:17] and when the ox cart came to the
[1:51:21] threshing
[1:51:22] floor
[1:51:24] right it's not only what happens but
[1:51:28] where it happens
[1:51:31] so they came to the threshing floor of
[1:51:35] chidin
[1:51:36] and The Oxen stumbled
[1:51:39] and uza
[1:51:41] poor uza
[1:51:44] poor uza
[1:51:47] he was just
[1:51:49] trying to do with maybe his King told
[1:51:52] him to do watch over that Ark
[1:51:56] and the Bible says in the ark wavered
[1:51:59] and he put his hand to the ark and when
[1:52:02] it did it says the anger of God slew him
[1:52:06] can you imagine and David's oh my God
[1:52:09] how can I bring the Ark of God you see
[1:52:12] if God would have allowed David
[1:52:16] to bring it on a new car it would have
[1:52:18] broke oh scripture
[1:52:21] it was not to be carried on an ox car it
[1:52:24] was to be placed over the shoulders of
[1:52:27] the Levites that that's where the word
[1:52:29] is carried today it is the ministry
[1:52:33] Hallelujah to carries the burden of the
[1:52:36] word over their shoulders
[1:52:45] and the sermon the angel of God 47 watch
[1:52:48] this
[1:52:50] God could have sent an angel down
[1:52:55] he could have let the angel come himself
[1:52:57] but instead of that
[1:52:58] he sent the angel to speak through the
[1:53:01] voice of a man
[1:53:02] God always used man for his word
[1:53:06] is that right he doesn't use
[1:53:07] organization so forth mechanical devices
[1:53:12] he uses
[1:53:13] amen
[1:53:15] the Holy Spirit fell upon men
[1:53:19] that's God's instrument here on Earth
[1:53:22] saints of God that's the saith the Lord
[1:53:27] he's the same yesterday
[1:53:29] today and forever he doesn't change his
[1:53:31] program
[1:53:32] 1950 three years later he picks it up
[1:53:35] again
[1:53:36] God doesn't fall upon mechanical devices
[1:53:39] God the Holy Spirit fell upon men
[1:53:42] is God's agent and the hardest thing
[1:53:45] that God has ever had to do was to get
[1:53:48] one mortal to believe another
[1:53:53] that sermon title is God in his people
[1:53:58] then two years later greater than
[1:54:00] Solomon is here
[1:54:02] he always used man God doesn't use
[1:54:04] Machinery mechanical vices he uses men
[1:54:07] individuals excuse me I didn't mean to
[1:54:10] holler that loud
[1:54:12] notice I
[1:54:14] I'm not excited though
[1:54:16] I know right where I am
[1:54:22] then he picks it up a year later
[1:54:24] God hiding himself in Simplicity then
[1:54:27] revealing himself in the same notice
[1:54:29] what he done he brought forth the child
[1:54:31] a simple human being
[1:54:33] he could have ordained the son
[1:54:36] wanted to deliver them
[1:54:39] he could have ordained the wind to
[1:54:40] deliver them he could have ordained an
[1:54:42] angel to deliver them God can do
[1:54:44] whatever he wants to do well how do you
[1:54:47] know that brother Branham God won't
[1:54:49] leave his program that's the reason we
[1:54:52] know that this day has got to be simple
[1:54:56] now he always works in Simplicity but
[1:55:00] God in the beginning that could have
[1:55:01] made the son to preach the gospel or
[1:55:03] when spirits of gods were an angel to
[1:55:05] preach the gospel but he ordained men
[1:55:08] for that purpose he never changes it
[1:55:13] he never ordained groups of men ordained
[1:55:15] men to preached he ordained men to
[1:55:17] preach the gospel not Machinery
[1:55:19] mechanical device
[1:55:21] or any Angelic being it was a man
[1:55:25] and when he brought deliverance from the
[1:55:27] people down there he sent a simple human
[1:55:29] being
[1:55:30] born of a simple family and a bunch of
[1:55:32] slaves
[1:55:33] I want you to understand when God sent a
[1:55:37] savior to the world
[1:55:40] he sent a son
[1:55:44] for God so loved the world he sent his
[1:55:47] only begotten son showing he will always
[1:55:51] use science
[1:56:02] God never changes his program
[1:56:05] the message listen to me now be careful
[1:56:08] here cannot distribute itself
[1:56:13] a tape doesn't walk into the jungles of
[1:56:16] Guyana
[1:56:17] on itself you ever seen a tape go
[1:56:23] or the books
[1:56:27] they don't
[1:56:28] go by themselves they're carried
[1:56:31] Who carries them
[1:56:33] amen
[1:56:35] God it's just still still his program
[1:56:43] how about brother Bassel there in Guyana
[1:56:47] he's a fishing captain
[1:56:49] he's out one day and he's got a whole
[1:56:51] load of fish
[1:56:53] that's worth lots of money sees the
[1:56:55] Pirates off the coast of Guyana they're
[1:56:57] going to take his catch and probably
[1:56:59] kill him and and throw his men overboard
[1:57:01] or something so he says Hey guys gather
[1:57:04] your nets load everything up let's go
[1:57:06] Full Throttle ahead and he goes and his
[1:57:10] boat just barely outruns the pirate boat
[1:57:12] he goes up a river he goes up into a
[1:57:15] river he finds a channel on the river
[1:57:17] and he just goes in there and guess what
[1:57:20] he runs out of gas
[1:57:27] he's out of gas man
[1:57:30] God had it for a purpose
[1:57:34] because the pirate both stopped turn her
[1:57:36] engine on
[1:57:38] listen for his Indian
[1:57:43] he disappeared
[1:57:46] and guess what two of the Amera Indians
[1:57:48] in a canoe
[1:57:49] they come paddling by hey
[1:57:52] he begins to talk to him they say he
[1:57:55] says hey do you have some gas I need gas
[1:57:57] in my boat yes they talk a little bit uh
[1:58:01] he tells him he's a Christian Pastor oh
[1:58:04] you're a pastor would you come preach in
[1:58:08] our village
[1:58:11] yeah
[1:58:12] brother Bassel
[1:58:14] runs away from Pirates
[1:58:16] runs out of gas
[1:58:18] two guys say would you come preach he
[1:58:22] goes and preaches in the village and
[1:58:24] guess what the whole village gets
[1:58:26] converted
[1:58:28] do you know the pastor can't even read
[1:58:32] do you know he has memorized the Bible
[1:58:35] by somebody reading it to him
[1:58:38] Faith cometh by
[1:58:40] hearing hearing the word of God he
[1:58:42] preaches because he remembers it is
[1:58:45] written he can't read it himself but
[1:58:47] it's in his mind let me tell you Thy
[1:58:50] Word of God have I learned to hide it in
[1:58:54] my heart that I learned not to sin
[1:58:56] against you
[1:59:00] how did those taping books get there
[1:59:06] they don't get there by themselves
[1:59:10] it's been as it's been in every age it's
[1:59:13] been the Levites
[1:59:14] ministry will carry the burden of the
[1:59:17] word over their shoulders because that's
[1:59:19] over their heart in trying to do God of
[1:59:22] service watch watch
[1:59:23] going by the priests by going to
[1:59:25] theologians by going to military forces
[1:59:28] and not even considering their god-sent
[1:59:30] messenger of the hour Nathan
[1:59:33] they did it wrong they went picked up
[1:59:35] the ark and put it upon a new card put
[1:59:39] it upon a new card a new denomination
[1:59:41] starting up
[1:59:43] not upon the god-given ordained way to
[1:59:45] pack it was supposed to be packed on the
[1:59:47] shoulders of the Levites but you see
[1:59:50] when you start wrong you keep going
[1:59:51] wrong
[1:59:54] trying to do got a service paragraph 124
[1:59:56] Levi's shoulders was God's original way
[1:59:59] to do it
[2:00:02] if you press play and don't obey
[2:00:05] you have put the word on a new Ox card
[2:00:11] don't interpret it
[2:00:13] say what he says
[2:00:18] God give us more men
[2:00:20] with a calling of God
[2:00:22] called God ordained God placed man
[2:00:25] within that take the word of God upon
[2:00:28] their heart
[2:00:31] First Corinthians 13 I'm bringing this
[2:00:34] to a close now
[2:00:36] and They Carried the Ark of God and a
[2:00:38] new card on the house of abinadev and
[2:00:40] uzen
[2:00:42] draved the cart
[2:00:44] and David and all Israel played before
[2:00:45] God with all their mind
[2:00:47] and with singing with Harps and with
[2:00:49] sultries and with timbrels with symbols
[2:00:52] and with trumpets When They Came Upon
[2:00:55] unto the threshing floor of China
[2:00:58] wow
[2:01:00] who's that put forth his hand to hold
[2:01:02] the ark and The Oxen stumbled and the
[2:01:05] anger of the Lord was kindled against
[2:01:07] uza and he smote him because he put his
[2:01:11] hand to the ark and there he died before
[2:01:14] God
[2:01:16] brother Brown said one of the last
[2:01:19] place to hit the earth is spiritual
[2:01:21] death
[2:01:25] if it was spiritual death to put your
[2:01:27] hand to the word of God without a call
[2:01:30] of God on your life it's spiritual death
[2:01:32] to this day
[2:01:34] amen now watch this I'm I I'm gonna
[2:01:36] bring this to a close for right now
[2:01:42] we know
[2:01:44] that Israel is God's chosen land is that
[2:01:48] right
[2:01:49] we pray for Israel
[2:01:51] now the center
[2:01:54] of the world
[2:01:56] is Israel
[2:02:01] and the center of Israel is Jerusalem
[2:02:06] in the center of Jerusalem
[2:02:09] is the Temple mount
[2:02:12] and the center of the Temple mount
[2:02:15] is the holy of holies
[2:02:20] did you know the prophet of God said
[2:02:22] that the same altar
[2:02:25] that Abraham went to sacrifice
[2:02:29] his son Isaac
[2:02:32] he said it's the same
[2:02:35] place
[2:02:37] that is the heart of the center
[2:02:40] of the Temple mount it is the holy of
[2:02:43] holies
[2:02:45] and the Jews are not even allowed to go
[2:02:48] to the Temple mount
[2:02:50] can you imagine
[2:02:51] it's their land it's listen and and it
[2:02:55] says and watch that this Temple that is
[2:02:58] there it's called the mosque of Omar
[2:03:02] it's a temple of abomination
[2:03:08] there's coming a a day Hallelujah when
[2:03:12] God's going to change all of this
[2:03:14] Hallelujah and he's going to bring
[2:03:15] Israel why do you think Israel is
[2:03:17] gathering together why do you think
[2:03:19] they're going back to the Homeland why
[2:03:21] do you think these uh Messianic Jews
[2:03:25] or are talking about wow and we can see
[2:03:28] we can see some of the things happening
[2:03:30] oh my Messianic Jews
[2:03:32] what are they doing God's letting the
[2:03:35] blending over period the times of the
[2:03:37] Gentiles just about over so Israel's
[2:03:40] getting ready they're ready to to
[2:03:42] receive their two prophets but the two
[2:03:45] prophets Moses and Elijah cannot come on
[2:03:48] the scene until the bride goes up how
[2:03:51] close are we Hallelujah I believe we're
[2:03:53] right there my brother
[2:03:55] brother my sister we have seen the wave
[2:03:58] sheep
[2:04:03] who was it
[2:04:05] a prophet of God
[2:04:07] the first one to come to maturity
[2:04:11] and waved over the congregation several
[2:04:13] times to show you what you will become
[2:04:22] musicians come right now
[2:04:25] right now
[2:04:27] the reason we're having all kinds of
[2:04:29] turmoil
[2:04:31] and different things happening even
[2:04:33] within the body
[2:04:37] is because God is purging the floor
[2:04:44] he is
[2:04:46] he's purging your life
[2:04:49] as well as he did the prophets and when
[2:04:52] the prophet
[2:04:53] humbled himself and said
[2:04:56] I'll not take the easy way
[2:05:01] I'll I'll choose the harder way
[2:05:05] I'm going to say this to all of you
[2:05:07] whether you belong here or anywhere else
[2:05:09] if you're part of his
[2:05:12] it is now the time to consecrate
[2:05:14] yourself
[2:05:16] and say God I consecrate myself
[2:05:18] I sanctify myself
[2:05:21] I will choose
[2:05:24] the harder way
[2:05:25] because God is fixing
[2:05:28] to do something right now and you better
[2:05:31] be ready
[2:05:32] you better be in that position
[2:05:36] and if you're not there you say oh God
[2:05:38] be merciful to me let me choose right
[2:05:42] now you can do it while you're sitting
[2:05:45] in that chair I don't need to have you
[2:05:46] to have an altar call the altar's in
[2:05:48] your heart
[2:05:50] maybe you're not living the way you
[2:05:52] should you're not doing what you should
