[25:15] truly but a you just things you know uh
[25:20] it so very very quickly and the Bible
[25:22] say it behooves us to redeem the time

[25:59] some and he's gone some real Dark Places
[26:02] and uh spoken to him on the phone
[26:05] probably five six times I think in last
[26:08] couple days and you know he was just
[26:11] through a you know how do I know if I'm
[26:17] forgiven you know and how do I know you
[26:20] know that God hears how do I uh I know
[26:24] these things what if I went too far and
[26:27] you know look brother Brenham always say
[26:30] answers that very simply he said look he
[26:33] said you might have gone quite a ways
[26:35] you might have strayed but he said if
[26:38] you've gone too far you would have no
[26:41] desire you wouldn't he said you could
[26:44] watch your mother's Soul fry in hell and
[26:46] laugh at it right and he says so you
[26:49] know if the devil ever tells you you've
[26:51] gone too far well number one he's a
[26:55] liar okay and so he there truth in him
[26:59] so uh you know we just talked just

[27:04] the Bible says confess our faults he is
[27:08] more than Faith just to forgive us

[33:02] right here brother Robert said it would
[33:04] be right there and I believed him and
[33:06] there it is and so brother Justin here
[33:09] if you could set it out there that way
[33:11] I'm not distracted by that thing and uh
[33:15] I remember one time uh uh when I was a
[33:18] kid my grandma lived right across the
[33:21] street from us probably I don't know 60
[33:23] yards across the street directly there
[33:26] and uh it was around around Christmas
[33:28] time and I thought to myself man I'm
[33:30] going to find my presents I can't wait
[33:33] and so where my grandma's living room
[33:36] where she would sit she could see right
[33:38] stairs there so I was climbing up the
[33:40] attic and I was trying to my presents
[33:43] and everything and Line This is back
[33:45] when there was land and um yep old and
[33:50] um and sure enough it was my mom and did
[33:53] you find what you're looking for I said
[33:56] how did Mom she said we can see you
[33:58] through the and uh anyways if that thing
[34:01] was right here I would be really
[34:03] distracted by wondering what's in it so
[34:05] God bless you richly we certainly
[34:07] appreciate that uh if you have your
[34:09] Bibles turn with me to the book of
[34:11] Psalm and chapter 28 Psalms chap
[34:17] 28 we'll read verses 1 through3
[34:32] and it says unto thee will I Cry Oh Lord
[34:35] my rock be not silent to me lest if thou
[34:40] be silent to me I become like them that
[34:43] go down into the pit hear the voice of
[34:46] my when I cry onto thee when I lift up
[34:49] my hand Lord thy
[34:52] holy draw me not away the wicked and
[34:55] with the work of iniquity with speak
[34:58] peace neighbors but Mischief is in their
[35:02] hearts you may be seated this
[35:07] evening verse one says uh onto the will
[35:11] I cry the Lord my rock be not silent
[35:15] unto me I would like to uh take for a
[35:19] simple thought this evening when God is
[35:23] silent when God is silent and so we know
[35:28] that God is not just some uh figment of
[35:32] our imagination but we realize that God
[35:35] is real and that God is a a real being
[35:40] with a real
[35:41] intelligence and this intelligence that
[35:44] we call uh God we understand he is the
[35:48] creator of the heavens and of the earth
[35:52] we understand that his intelligence far
[35:56] greater than the int that we have as
[35:59] mortal that's right his intelligence is
[36:03] the
[36:05] intelligence the Supreme in intelligence
[36:08] it is the int that is above uh anything
[36:12] that we could even uh imagine as as
[36:15] being smart or being intelligent God is
[36:19] so much more above that his intelligence
[36:22] is actually so great that a man will
[36:25] look at it and will think it's foolish
[36:28] right it is so intelligent that it
[36:31] confounds the wise and that's what it is
[36:34] designed to do that that that the wise
[36:37] and The Prudent would look to it and
[36:39] they would try to understand it and he's
[36:41] so intelligent that he can reveal
[36:44] himself in
[36:46] Simplicity to where the wayfaring man
[36:49] can understand it but when man his
[36:52] intelligence and uh and his education
[36:55] science when he looks at tries to
[36:58] understand God says I cannot understand
[37:02] this is foolishness but to the Bride of
[37:04] Jesus Christ God is Not foolishness his
[37:08] intelligence is not foolishness his word
[37:11] is foolishness but it is the of God
[37:15] which Chang lives to Salvation that's
[37:18] right so we see that uh we cannot
[37:21] understand god with our human eyes when
[37:24] we realize when we when we look into the
[37:27] galaxies and we look at the Sun and we
[37:30] look at the Moon and we look at nature
[37:32] and we look at stars and galaxies and
[37:34] all these things I don't understand how
[37:37] people can look at these things can look
[37:40] at nature they can see how everything
[37:42] run continuity one with another but yet
[37:46] not believe in an intelligent who
[37:50] created all these
[37:53] things everything runs perly and in
[37:56] order
[37:58] for something great not to be
[38:01] it
[38:03] Hallelujah so we see that this world
[38:05] that we're living in today is is in
[38:07] complete chaos and the reason that the
[38:10] world is in chaos is because of the
[38:14] intelligence of man it's not because of
[38:17] God it's not because necessarily uh I
[38:21] was going to say of Satan but it is but
[38:24] it's man's own intelligence and his own
[38:27] will wisdom that has this world in
[38:30] turmoil and brother brandom said he said
[38:33] that God that is going to destroy
[38:36] himself man is going to destroy this
[38:39] Earth he's going to destroy this Society
[38:42] because of his own wisdom and his own
[38:46] intelligence father don't let me go this
[38:49] this the wavered way own smarts or my
[38:51] own intelligence or my own wisdom let
[38:55] walk in the wisdom of God because if I'm
[38:57] left to myself I walk in my own wisdom
[39:00] it's going to lead me astray but if I
[39:03] walk in the wisdom of God under the
[39:06] intelligence of his word it'll keep me
[39:09] in that straight and narrow path the
[39:11] problem is we get distracted because of
[39:14] our own wisdom we try to figure things
[39:16] out I went too far but about this how
[39:20] can God me it's not up to me try and
[39:24] figure it out of God does those things
[39:27] he written it in his word there believe
[39:31] it you say brother stepen simple that's
[39:35] faith faith is so simp yet it is a
[39:38] profound
[39:41] thing birth pains 1965 brother Bram says
[39:45] people's science has broke into God's
[39:47] Great laboratory until they're
[39:49] destroying they're going to destroy
[39:51] themselves God lets always lets wisdom
[39:55] destroy himself
[39:58] don't let me on to my own wisdom
[40:01] Lord God doesn't destroy anything man
[40:04] destroys himself by wisdom as he did at
[40:07] the beginning taking Satan's wisdom of
[40:09] God's word now knows she must give way
[40:13] she cannot stand what's he talking about
[40:17] he talking about Mother Earth she can't
[40:20] give way anyer she can't stand any
[40:24] longer she has to give there has to be
[40:27] something happens to this that we dwell
[40:31] in Mother Earth today is in a place of
[40:36] total Decay and
[40:38] rottenness she has been robbed of her
[40:40] resources taken advantage of and brother
[40:43] brandham says this he said that she is
[40:46] she is so
[40:47] flustered red in the FL NE red in the
[40:51] face and nervous with tidal waves
[40:54] earthquakes floods and so forth are
[40:58] rotten condition he says her politics
[41:01] are her church anity rotten denomination
[41:05] rotten people's lives are and it's
[41:08] causing aess upon this earth live in and
[41:12] brother Brenham says calls her mother
[41:14] earth as a he's red in the face she's
[41:18] embarrassed of what's in place around
[41:21] her she can't believe the things that
[41:23] are taking place of of society and
[41:26] politics and all the these different
[41:28] evils in the world today and she's
[41:30] ashamed she's red in the face therefore
[41:34] she's giving out these tidal waves she's
[41:37] she's flooding the Earth there's there's
[41:39] one year there's a lot of fires the next
[41:41] year there's a lot of floods one year
[41:44] there's a lot of earthquakes and and we
[41:46] see that she she's rocking and she's
[41:49] weighing in the
[41:50] balance what's happening she has to rot
[41:55] before she can give
[41:57] because she a birthing
[42:00] position but before a can bring forth
[42:04] life first it has to run whenever we see
[42:07] a little seed a little apple seed or
[42:10] what is that hard shell that it
[42:13] surrounds it is not life of the
[42:16] seed life of the seed dwell within that
[42:19] little hardship so that's why when the
[42:22] seed is planted in the ground it's got
[42:24] to rot and if it doesn't rot it'll never
[42:27] bring forth the life that dwells within
[42:30] that shell and that's where planet Earth
[42:33] is at today she's rotten to the very
[42:35] core but Hallelujah that's a good thing
[42:38] for us because it's just a sign that
[42:41] when she rots because of this filth
[42:44] that's taken place around her and in her
[42:47] we know that she's going to birth
[42:49] another new heavens and a new Earth
[42:53] that's what we need to keep our eyes
[42:55] upon is that new Earth is that New
[42:58] Jerusalem not to get caught with
[43:01] politics and the EV of this world though
[43:04] it is evil we want to look to the we
[43:07] want to look to our Pro we want to look
[43:09] to what's of us not what's behind us
[43:12] what's going on right now
[43:16] thank we see that it's
[43:20] rotten why because she's going
[43:24] birth God created all these things
[43:27] things he didn't just keep it in his
[43:29] mind and think about it until it
[43:33] happened but God first thought it within
[43:35] his mind and after he thinks it in his
[43:38] mind then he begins to speak with his
[43:41] voice our title the see is that go this
[43:45] silent God but I want to spend time to
[43:48] show you first that God is not always
[43:51] silent God has a voice actually likes to
[43:55] speak God actually likes to tell and God
[43:58] likes to reveal things to his bride he
[44:01] doesn't just keep them to himself but he
[44:04] pulls his bride clo and he says here's
[44:07] my secrets here is the mystery of the
[44:10] book that was once hidden now it is
[44:12] being made manifest it's this book which
[44:15] was once sealed with Seven Seals is now
[44:18] opened it has now been revealed and here
[44:21] you go I'm going to give you these
[44:22] Mysteries so God is not always silent we
[44:26] see there's two reasons why God is
[44:28] silent and we'll get into that in a
[44:30] moment but God has a voice and he likes
[44:33] to speak you know you have a voice also
[44:37] and God wants you to speak also he
[44:40] doesn't just want you to keep things
[44:41] within your mind but he wants you to
[44:44] speak in your
[44:46] mind all the sisters said a the brothers
[44:49] were
[44:49] [Music]
[44:51] like that's not how men
[44:54] operate my daughter told me day and uh
[44:59] what was it it was something like um you
[45:03] know dads can answer any profound
[45:06] question words
[45:09] mm you know you know we know all things
[45:13] mm that's right
[45:15] it's you know the secret to to marriage
[45:18] is this is that as long as you catch a
[45:21] few a few sentences a few words of the
[45:23] sentence you're okay as long as you can
[45:25] continue it you'll do real good yes H
[45:28] right and my wife will say it was a,
[45:32] dress yeah go ahead you're listening to
[45:35] what I'm saying are you no I wasn't so
[45:39] it only works sometimes Psalm 33 verses
[45:43] 6-9 by the word Lord where the heavens
[45:47] and all the host of them bre of his
[45:49] mouth he GA Waters of the sea together
[45:53] he he layeth up the depth in in
[45:55] storehouses let all the Earth fear the
[45:58] lord let all the inhabitants of the
[46:01] world stand in awe of him for he spake
[46:05] and it was done he commanded and it
[46:09] stood fast so we realize that all things
[46:13] that were created they were created by
[46:15] the very voice of
[46:17] God whether it was the heavens and the
[46:21] stars and the moon and whether it's the
[46:23] Earth and everything dwells there in
[46:25] everything see everything that unseen we
[46:30] understand everything was created by
[46:32] voice of God that's
[46:34] right why God has a voice God likes to
[46:40] speak this when God speaks
[46:43] things when gods and says something
[46:46] situations get better when God speaks uh
[46:50] lives are changed people are healed
[46:52] people are delivered circumstances
[46:55] around us change why because because of
[46:57] the voice of God
[47:01] lord so God has a
[47:04] voice he spoke to Abraham in the Book of
[47:07] Genesis concerning a promise that he
[47:09] would be the father of many nations he
[47:12] spoke to Moses through a burning bush
[47:14] and on Mount siani he spoke to Elijah he
[47:17] spoke to Micaiah he spoke to all the
[47:20] different prophets lip the ear as it
[47:22] were why because God has a voice and God
[47:27] likes to speak
[47:32] amen God spoke to the prophets from lip
[47:35] to ear and theet then would re to the
[47:39] people what told them and become the
[47:43] voice of God to the with thus sayth the
[47:47] Lord amen so it was no longer the people
[47:51] are the prophets that were speaking but
[47:54] when they would speak through inspir
[47:57] ation we understand when they speak and
[47:59] say thus sayith the Lord that it was no
[48:03] longer the person speaking that's right
[48:05] but it's the Lord speaking praise God
[48:08] you know uh it just comes to my my mind
[48:12] there and I'll share this where we
[48:15] started with the senior youth on why we
[48:19] believe what we believe and and using
[48:23] scriptures to you know because the Bible
[48:25] is our abs want to use the scripture to
[48:29] up our thoughts on why we believe
[48:31] believe and here last week last Sunday
[48:34] our our our uh meeting was about why we
[48:37] believe in a prophet and why we believe
[48:41] that brother Brandon was that prophet
[48:43] and so so we went through it anyways and
[48:45] and and and I was sharing and
[48:48] admonishing the youth and just saying
[48:49] listen don't be scared about what you
[48:52] believe and don't be scared to share
[48:54] what you believe with other people
[48:56] because you never know what'll happen
[48:58] you know maybe someone might get
[49:00] converted and believe what you believe
[49:02] too and I realized that in doing this a
[49:07] lot easier said than
[49:09] done so go Monday at work uh um paint
[49:16] and everything and um UPS on these door
[49:18] jams and I probably painted these door
[49:22] four times and people just come through
[49:24] and they could car and ding it up and up
[49:28] and all sorts and you know the painter
[49:30] will get it that's that's the that's the
[49:33] the saying right the painter will get it
[49:35] and he'll clean it up and so anyway
[49:37] there was I had walked in and and there
[49:39] was this guy and I had some music
[49:41] playing on my phone some Christian music
[49:43] or whatever and he goes boy you're a
[49:45] Christian I said yes sir I am and um
[49:48] this guy's from California I seen his
[49:50] license plate so I already bit about him
[49:53] and I'm all here's a c kid and uh God
[49:58] can save California is that right
[50:00] brother Ron and so anyways here got this
[50:04] long hair and T nice guy man real nice
[50:07] guy so he's like oh praise the Lord to
[50:10] him we begin to talk conversations over
[50:12] and I go back bathroom and I'm trying to
[50:15] touch up guy comes along and uh and he's
[50:18] a Mexican guy a little bit older and um
[50:21] you know how some of these older Mexican
[50:23] guys can be they're real serious man
[50:25] real serious you know they got
[50:27] that that that attitude so this guy he
[50:31] he he said something to me and I said
[50:33] you're not a drywall guy are you cuz
[50:35] drywall guys had come through three or
[50:37] four times and I have to redo the work
[50:40] and and so he's all no I'm not no
[50:42] drywall guy I said oh Gloria
[50:46] adios and he looks at me he goes glor
[50:51] adios Gloria not a Christian I'm a
[50:56] so this is where the conversation was it
[50:58] wasn't with the kid it was with this guy
[51:02] and so so so he's talking to me or
[51:05] whatever ask me a question he goes who
[51:07] is to you kind of question I said okay
[51:12] to me Jesus was manifestation of God and
[51:14] flesh pretty simple well he
[51:16] misunderstood what I said and he thought
[51:19] I was trinitarian so he starts giving me
[51:22] like Jesus only Doctrine and he begins
[51:25] to share with me and he says you know
[51:27] are you a father well yes sir I am and
[51:30] you're a son and I'm thinking yeah I am
[51:33] and he said you're a spirit I said
[51:35] that's right yes sir he goes but what's
[51:37] your name I said Hallelujah yeah it's
[51:40] Stephen and he goes well that's a same
[51:42] with the Lord Jesus Christ and all of a
[51:44] sudden my ringers are going off like
[51:46] I've heard this stuff before
[51:48] huh and so anyways uh he says I've been
[51:52] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I
[51:54] said praise the Lord so have I I said
[51:56] said have you re Holy Ghost so guy is
[52:00] pretty aggressive to me they're it's an
[52:02] older Mexican they are the Mexican
[52:04] people here man huh brother Paul that's
[52:08] how these old are man and um and so
[52:12] anyways uh so he's kind of come a little
[52:16] bit and he's he's he's um a grand to say
[52:20] the least and let him go with it yeah
[52:23] that's true I believe the same thing I
[52:25] don't believe in the trinity so we go
[52:27] back and forth so I thought well here we
[52:29] go I'm going to ask this guy and uh I
[52:33] and I'll be honest with you I was
[52:35] telling the youth don't be scared to say
[52:37] what you
[52:38] believe man I felt sick cuz I knew what
[52:42] I was going to
[52:45] do I'm like Hey cuz he's in the bathroom
[52:47] I was in the hallway at this stage I
[52:49] said hey you know Malachi 4 he opens the
[52:53] door huh I said you know Malachi 4 verse
[52:56] 5 and six behold I send you Elijah the
[52:59] prophet he says yeah that I I know that
[53:03] script I said
[53:04] really yeah I know that and so I said
[53:08] well who is what's his name he goes you

[53:17] me
[53:19] Lord said is William brandham no it's
[53:23] not it's not William brandham he goes
[53:26] starts telling me about these other
[53:27] churches and about how they have
[53:28] prophets and they'll send false prophets
[53:30] and he now he's kind of mad at me
[53:33] because now he knows what I believe okay
[53:36] and and he's saying uh well this one has
[53:39] a prophet and this one over here and
[53:41] he's really fighting me back I said wait
[53:43] a second what's your
[53:44] problem if you know about Malachi and6
[53:48] and I'm guessing believe it where did it
[53:50] go wrong where did you get offended and
[53:54] why did you
[53:55] leave what happened happened why do you
[53:58] have so much against it and I discern it
[54:02] was very easy to
[54:03] discern and he goes well I dated a girl
[54:07] that went this to church a long time ago
[54:09] he goes let me ask you a question and it
[54:12] good I was always fighting with her
[54:13] brothers and this and that saints of God
[54:16] fighting with somebody doesn't really
[54:18] get you anywhere that's right but I
[54:20] wasn't in fighting stage yet that comes
[54:22] in a second
[54:27] so yeah so he told he says to me let me
[54:30] ask you a question I don't want to take
[54:32] up too much time but he says let me ask
[54:34] you a question will there be animals in
[54:36] heaven I'm thinking this guy knows the
[54:38] message I says yeah there will be he
[54:41] says tell me why I said because he said
[54:44] so oh so you believe because he said
[54:47] there's going to be his horse and his
[54:48] dog there that it's going to be there I
[54:50] said yes sir I do so then he got a smart
[54:52] alley well is Paul going to have a is
[54:56] going to be full of farms up there in
[54:58] heaven sir I don't
[55:01] know so anyways uh we're talking back
[55:04] and forth a little bit let me tell you
[55:07] something

[55:16] think so I draw my sword I'm doing my
[55:19] doing my touch-ups on my knees I stand
[55:22] up now we're right there two of us
[55:25] together I I said let me ask you a
[55:27] question you've been asking me all these
[55:28] questions let me ask you a question what
[55:31] is the Vindication of a prophet in the
[55:32] Old
[55:33] Testament he says what do you mean I
[55:35] said well let me tell you the answer to
[55:37] the question if he says thus sayith the
[55:39] Lord and it comes to pass the Bible says
[55:42] to hear that man I said now you know the
[55:44] message and I Know It

[55:50] give the right to vote it'll be the
[55:53] wrong vote they'll vote man 19

[56:05] he goes from sin to sin that there will
[56:08] be a woman in power in the United States
[56:11] 19
[56:12] and33 even allowed to vote now look at
[56:15] the woman in America tell me was the
[56:17] prophecy right or was it wrong I said he
[56:20] prophesied 19 and33 about how cars would
[56:23] be egg-shaped and they'd be driverless
[56:25] cars tell me was he right or wrong and I
[56:28] just started going through all the
[56:30] visions of brother brandom I said let me
[56:33] ask you this every time that somebody
[56:35] stood before him was he when he
[56:37] discerned their hearts is ah no com
[56:42] Amigo I can't have this discussion I
[56:45] don't so much and off he
[56:47] went I said let me tell you here one
[56:50] second I said why you don't believe this
[56:53] message he goes no tell me I said for
[56:56] for you to believe you know what you're
[56:59] right and I thought and he just off I
[57:02] thought by the confession of his own
[57:06] mouth don't be scared about this message
[57:10] don't be scared because the Bible backs
[57:12] it up his life backs it up the
[57:15] Vindication backs it up Hallelujah we
[57:19] got nothing to be scared about when we
[57:21] share it I don't care who it is or how
[57:23] much of the scripture he knows
[57:26] it's the
[57:35] truth yeah so anyways I was having to
[57:39] practice a little preach to the youth
[57:42] realized it was tough but it's worth it
[57:46] man it's worth
[57:48] it you get your feathers r a little bit
[57:51] and you have a of back and forth it's
[57:54] for you it's good to get those those
[57:57] those feathers you know those feathers
[58:00] they're all feathers you ever see where
[58:02] a been roosting or a bird has been
[58:04] sitting on a tree and there's a bunch of
[58:06] feathers all over the place they're dead
[58:09] feathers we don't need dead feathers on
[58:12] our body we got to shake them off once
[58:14] in a
[58:15] while that's what it did it was good I
[58:18] enjoyed it it was
[58:22] fun so we realized that Daniel Elijah
[58:26] Moses and all these prophets that we see
[58:29] throughout the scripture all the way to
[58:31] Jesus Christ himself we realize that
[58:33] they were the voice of God with thus
[58:36] saith the Lord my commission 1951
[58:39] brother brandham said just like the pole
[58:41] in the water of Bethesda it couldn't say
[58:44] look what a great water I am for when
[58:46] the angel went off of the water it was
[58:49] just water is that that's right now I'm
[58:52] your by the grace of God but when of the
[58:55] Lord moves down it then a voice of God
[58:58] to you now not is a voice of God that um
[59:04] to maybe if I offended you by saying
[59:06] forgive me but I felt that might been
[59:10] resented I am God's voice to you so he
[59:16] went from saying a voice to you to
[59:18] saying I am God's voice to you see I I
[59:24] say that again that time was under
[59:26] inspiration you see and I felt bad about
[59:28] it the first time but I repeated it I
[59:30] can say nothing in myself but what he
[59:32] shows me I say it you believe it and
[59:34] watch that happen see what is it it's no
[59:38] longer just a voice but it's the voice
[59:42] of God to you personally as an
[59:45] individual he says now I say that under
[59:49] inspiration he didn't want to say it to
[59:51] offend people but when the man gets uh
[59:54] insired by God and the spirit you just
[59:57] got to uh uh lay the axe to the tree man
[1:00:01] and let the chip where they
[1:00:05] will but he am God's
[1:00:08] voice this is kind of a continuation on
[1:00:11] of
[1:00:12] Sunday but the voice of that started
[1:00:16] creation the same voice that continued
[1:00:18] down through the
[1:00:20] prophets understand it is not a
[1:00:22] different voice but it's the same voice
[1:00:25] in creation that spoke Let There Be is
[1:00:28] the same voice that spoke through the
[1:00:30] prophets and said thus sayeth the Lord
[1:00:33] It's not a different voice neither a
[1:00:35] different being but it is God now it's
[1:00:38] not just all to himself it but he's
[1:00:43] using as an
[1:00:45] instrument now to say what he to get
[1:00:48] said to the people brother brandham said
[1:00:51] this God could have used the sun used
[1:00:54] the trees he could have nature to preach
[1:00:57] his gospel yet he still does but
[1:01:00] instrumentation is man and he has never
[1:01:04] changed his ways thank you
[1:01:08] Lord it is not
[1:01:10] woman for the Bible says that a woman
[1:01:13] must remain silent within the church it
[1:01:17] does not mean that a woman cannot say
[1:01:19] Amen in the church and all the sisters
[1:01:22] said am praise the Lord but it means
[1:01:25] that she must not assert authority over
[1:01:28] the man the Bible says that Adam was
[1:01:32] created then and Adam was not dece but
[1:01:36] the woman was the one was
[1:01:38] deceived why you can see like a lot of
[1:01:42] uh uh denominations that have women
[1:01:45] pastors let anything go within the
[1:01:48] assembly well love and God loves you and
[1:01:53] come as you are and it's all love and
[1:01:55] love
[1:01:56] and love then they have homosexual
[1:01:59] pastors both women and men what a
[1:02:03] mockery of God that kind of stuff should
[1:02:07] not be be behind the pulpit uh before
[1:02:10] God's people
[1:02:13] amen amen it's
[1:02:19] true so we realize that this that that
[1:02:23] what God started in creation through the
[1:02:25] prophet
[1:02:26] same voice down to Jesus down through
[1:02:29] the new test down through the discip
[1:02:33] right up until brother Brandon we write
[1:02:35] up until time that we are now living uh
[1:02:39] it it is a different voice but it is a
[1:02:44] continuation of the same voice started
[1:02:47] back here because I am Alpha and I am I
[1:02:51] am the a I am the Z I'm the beginning
[1:02:54] I'm the ending my voice which was here
[1:02:57] voice in the end time same voice it is
[1:03:01] the god just within a different
[1:03:04] manifestation through
[1:03:10] peoples we know the bride of Christ now
[1:03:13] is final sounding the voice of God to
[1:03:17] the Gentile
[1:03:19] dispensation It's the final sounding of
[1:03:22] the same voice that was back here amen
[1:03:25] it is not a different voice that's right
[1:03:28] but it's the same voice now she's
[1:03:30] sounding her gospel trumpet and what is
[1:03:34] this bride saying she's saying the exact
[1:03:37] same thing that this seventh angel
[1:03:39] messenger said yes sir because the bride
[1:03:43] and the spirit
[1:03:45] say they're saying the thing that's
[1:03:49] right
[1:03:53] Hallelujah she does not one word nor
[1:03:56] take away from it but she stand on the
[1:04:00] solid rock of thus sayith fulfilling her
[1:04:06] commission understand those of you who
[1:04:09] claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:12] God has commissioned you not to stay
[1:04:15] quiet not to keep it within your mind or
[1:04:18] within your heart but to take that
[1:04:20] little book to eat the little book and
[1:04:23] to prophesy that thing that you have
[1:04:26] taken part of that is your commission in
[1:04:30] this day that is your responsibility in
[1:04:34] this day it's not just the pastor it's
[1:04:36] not just the preacher it's not just the
[1:04:38] deacons but those who are with this
[1:04:42] mystical body Jesus Christ the Christ
[1:04:46] are
[1:04:47] commissioned to take the word and to
[1:04:53] prophesy to share how you're got live
[1:04:57] Amen to share what God has life to share
[1:05:02] in the time piece of great
[1:05:06] scriptures you're commissioned of God
[1:05:08] Amen and you're saying surely not me
[1:05:11] surely
[1:05:13] you well I'm scared so am
[1:05:17] I I don't know what to say neither do I
[1:05:21] sometimes but when you're commissioned
[1:05:22] to do something
[1:05:26] sir yes
[1:05:27] sir I I
[1:05:30] can want me to speak to that
[1:05:33] person Lord help
[1:05:38] me you there's a proverb that uh God
[1:05:44] those who help
[1:05:45] themselves that's a lie God helps those
[1:05:49] who
[1:05:51] can't I think that's why I make a pretty
[1:05:54] good Christian because I can't help
[1:05:57] myself I need God to lead me I need God
[1:06:00] to help me I need God to pick me up when
[1:06:02] I fall I need God in my life and I can't
[1:06:06] do it without him
[1:06:08] amen me too so you've been commissioned
[1:06:11] by God to become one with the book by
[1:06:13] eating it and letting your life then be
[1:06:16] the
[1:06:17] manifestation of that
[1:06:20] prophecy if you if it's not your your
[1:06:23] your time or your if it's not for you to
[1:06:25] preach a sermon brother brandham says
[1:06:27] what live your
[1:06:33] sermon so now we see that speaks in many
[1:06:36] different ways he through nature he
[1:06:38] speaks through reading his word he us
[1:06:42] through uh the Min of the word he speaks
[1:06:44] to us through dreams and visions and
[1:06:47] preaching and and and and other people
[1:06:50] to encourage and to help us
[1:06:53] along Journey
[1:06:56] God doing when he's doing that speaking
[1:06:59] to
[1:07:01] you but so much of the time we get so
[1:07:06] carnal so much of the time our hearts
[1:07:09] get so hardened that when the voice of
[1:07:12] God speaks we miss it I say father keep
[1:07:15] my spirit soft keep my heart tender keep
[1:07:20] it pure that when you speak to me
[1:07:22] whether it's through the minister
[1:07:24] through reading your word whe whether
[1:07:25] it's through a a a compassionate friend
[1:07:28] or whatever it may be father when you
[1:07:31] take the time to speak to me let my ears
[1:07:35] and be be be open to hear and my heart
[1:07:38] soft to
[1:07:39] receive
[1:07:42] Lord God does those he also speaks to us
[1:07:45] with an Voice direct the ear just like
[1:07:50] he Samuel you see we can't God in this
[1:07:53] little box
[1:07:55] that he can only speak on Wednesday
[1:07:57] nights and he can to you on Sundays and
[1:07:59] it and and be a certain way be under uh
[1:08:04] expectation you got to be under
[1:08:06] anticipation to say wow I wonder how God
[1:08:10] is going to speak to me today yes I
[1:08:13] wonder is he I wonder how he's going to
[1:08:15] do it and when you begin to wander these
[1:08:17] things and you're under expectation for
[1:08:20] it you'll begin to realize what speaks
[1:08:27] there's no greater feeling God comes by
[1:08:29] and speaks to us as individuals there's
[1:08:32] not greater than when he comes by and he
[1:08:34] body and he answers prayer and feel his
[1:08:37] presence and God and it's just wonderful
[1:08:41] fantastic and We Know It And encourages
[1:08:43] us and we know what
[1:08:46] good what happens when God is
[1:08:50] silent what happens when we're praying
[1:08:52] and there's no answer back what happens
[1:08:55] when when we're under anticipation and
[1:08:56] there's silence what happens when
[1:08:59] they're silent when we're listening for
[1:09:01] the voice of
[1:09:03] God how do we react to it and what does
[1:09:07] it do to
[1:09:09] us
[1:09:13] hallelujah why would
[1:09:15] God be purposely
[1:09:19] silent when we know that he hears and
[1:09:22] answers
[1:09:24] our why
[1:09:26] it why look like God is just ignoring us
[1:09:30] he's not back we're not anything out of
[1:09:34] the services we hear anything we haven't
[1:09:37] had we no one's encouraged us we there's
[1:09:40] just
[1:09:42] silence why God be Sil why wouldn't he
[1:09:47] speak if he loves us so much have he
[1:09:50] cared so much for us why doesn't he
[1:09:54] answer why is is it that there's times
[1:09:56] in our lives and I know you can all
[1:09:58] attest to this that it seems like the
[1:10:01] voice of God is
[1:10:03] silent it seems like he's taken a step
[1:10:06] back it seems like his presence has left
[1:10:09] us it's just quietness there's nothing
[1:10:11] there it it it seems like there's
[1:10:13] there's there God doesn't
[1:10:15] care because if he really cared he would
[1:10:20] answer 1960 Elijah in the meal offering
[1:10:23] brother brandom says you know God has a
[1:10:25] way of answering prayer this little
[1:10:27] woman had lived true talking about uh uh
[1:10:31] the the the little woman there that had
[1:10:34] the Barrel in the meal and it was they
[1:10:37] were all out of
[1:10:38] water she had not married again she was
[1:10:42] stay to meet her husband in glory was an
[1:10:45] honorable woman for weeks the barrel had
[1:10:47] been going down down and her continually
[1:10:50] praying it still looked like there was
[1:10:52] no hope in nowhere you know could there
[1:10:56] we could get a lesson from that that if
[1:10:58] you have prayed andm all the
[1:10:59] requirements that God requires you to
[1:11:01] meet and he's still silent he doesn't
[1:11:04] say anything and yet you've met the
[1:11:07] requirements now what happens then so we
[1:11:12] see as as we go through this that
[1:11:15] there's going to be two reasons why God
[1:11:17] stays silent whenever we are in uh
[1:11:21] trying to have fellowship with him and
[1:11:22] we're praying and we're asking and we're
[1:11:24] seeking there's two reasons
[1:11:27] why but brother brandom says first of
[1:11:30] all there that that and this really had
[1:11:33] had struck out to me here and he says
[1:11:36] that uh yet you've met the
[1:11:43] requirements thing that God is is is
[1:11:46] doing is that there's these certain
[1:11:49] requirements for us that we must follow
[1:11:53] in order to hear
[1:11:58] from now when we first come to Christ
[1:12:02] and we give our heart to the Lord we
[1:12:04] realize that that that as a sinner that
[1:12:06] God does hear the prayer of a sincere
[1:12:09] heart who is sincerely repenting of
[1:12:11] their ways but a person that is
[1:12:14] professing to be a Christian and now
[1:12:17] they have not met the requirement of
[1:12:19] completely coming under the blood and
[1:12:22] they have unconfessed sin in their life
[1:12:25] we realize that this that God wants us
[1:12:29] to um repent of our
[1:12:32] sins it's not just a one-time deal well
[1:12:37] I asked God way back here and I asked
[1:12:39] him to forgive me of my praise the Lord
[1:12:42] I don't have to again
[1:12:44] no it's natural for us in the body to be
[1:12:48] Sinners did you know
[1:12:51] that unfortunate actually because here
[1:12:54] we are when
[1:12:55] come to Christ we're trying to live a CH
[1:12:58] and we're trying to do good trying to do
[1:13:01] the best that and yet within our still
[1:13:04] there's still this brother it a sticky
[1:13:07] nature and we realize on a daily basis
[1:13:10] that we have a fight with this sticky
[1:13:12] nature and when we feed this sticky
[1:13:15] nature it is the nature that's going to
[1:13:17] consume our body and not only will it
[1:13:19] consume our bodies it'll consume Our
[1:13:21] Lives it'll consume your mind it'll
[1:13:24] consume your think thinking it'll
[1:13:25] consume your heart which therefore will
[1:13:27] consume what you do in this life and so
[1:13:31] if we are feeding this sticky nature it
[1:13:35] is almost impossible for us to live an
[1:13:38] overcoming
[1:13:40] life I know I shouldn't but
[1:13:44] stop someone say that I know I
[1:13:48] shouldn't because of
[1:13:50] iniquity knowing what's right and not it
[1:13:54] the love of
[1:13:55] many
[1:13:57] wax
[1:14:00] amen why because of iniquity I know we
[1:14:04] need to go past I know within our minds
[1:14:08] to yes Lord within our hearts amen and
[1:14:11] meet the requirements of God in our
[1:14:16] lives because the Bible says this the
[1:14:20] Bible says If thy heart condemns thee
[1:14:22] not ask what thou wilt
[1:14:25] and it'll be given onto you but when
[1:14:28] your own heart is condemning you because
[1:14:31] you're feeding the wrong nature you can
[1:14:34] never have the grounds of Faith to stand
[1:14:37] upon the solid rock of faith and say
[1:14:39] father I really need this when your
[1:14:42] heart condemns you you can't have faith
[1:14:44] to ask that's right but when your heart
[1:14:46] condemns you not hallelujah oh it's a
[1:14:50] complete different
[1:14:51] story show us and it will satisfy us
[1:14:55] how you in the prayer line that's
[1:14:57] standing in the line if there's any
[1:15:00] confess sin in your life I'm laying it
[1:15:02] right back in my brother look if you
[1:15:05] have got sin that you have confessed
[1:15:09] just be aware that you'll be worse than
[1:15:11] ever come here to be prayed for confess
[1:15:14] sin in your life you see so instead of
[1:15:17] coming through the prayer line and
[1:15:19] wanting to get better and wanting to get
[1:15:21] healed and wanting to get delivered if
[1:15:24] there's unconfessed sin in their life
[1:15:27] that person's life will actually get
[1:15:29] worse the sickness will get worse
[1:15:32] whatever it is that's troubling that
[1:15:34] person will actually get worse in their
[1:15:36] lives so that's why the Bible says this
[1:15:39] lay hands suddenly on no
[1:15:43] man they might have a desire to be
[1:15:46] healed they might have a desire to be
[1:15:49] set free and all these things but if
[1:15:52] they're holding on to sin in their lives
[1:15:55] that prayer is actually going to make it
[1:15:58] worse amen and it actually has a effect
[1:16:03] on their lives that never went through
[1:16:05] the prayer
[1:16:07] line good advice it is for us that if we
[1:16:11] ever need we ever come up to the front
[1:16:14] we want to be Anointed with oil laid
[1:16:17] upon us and those things that if we come
[1:16:19] up here with
[1:16:22] sin that our life might actually worse
[1:16:26] instead
[1:16:28] better that's why it's good for you if
[1:16:31] someone ask you would you pray for me
[1:16:33] brother would you pray for me sister I'm
[1:16:35] in desperate need I'm in desperate help
[1:16:37] well what is the
[1:16:39] need what is the
[1:16:41] help why are you having such a hard time
[1:16:45] what's going on it's not that you're
[1:16:46] being nosy but you're trying to discern
[1:16:50] and find out what is it in this person's
[1:16:53] life if there's anything that's causing
[1:16:55] this and if it's something that's
[1:16:57] causing it and it's unconfessed sin I
[1:17:00] don't want to pray to cast that thing
[1:17:02] off because I'll be working against the
[1:17:05] works of God in that person's
[1:17:09] life it's very very isn't
[1:17:16] it he said confess just be aware that
[1:17:19] you'll you ever come here to for with
[1:17:23] unconfessed life you may things right if
[1:17:26] that's in your life out of line just a
[1:17:28] minute make right come back in line why
[1:17:32] does he say to come back line because if
[1:17:35] you've made things right if you've if
[1:17:37] you've confessed your faults before God
[1:17:40] and you've been overshadowed and
[1:17:41] cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:44] even the gift in brother brandom's life
[1:17:45] couldn't bring it up because it's not
[1:17:48] there anyways amen because our sins have
[1:17:51] been washed in the bleach blood of Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ thank you but if it's unconfessed
[1:17:56] it's there for the prophet to see
[1:18:00] it now that's the reason my lines used
[1:18:02] to be when I when I combed each person
[1:18:05] closely to see if there was sin in their
[1:18:07] life by the visions of the Lord then the
[1:18:09] reason I did that was to be sure if God
[1:18:12] permitted Satan to put uh something on
[1:18:14] the people and I come prayer and take it
[1:18:17] off I would be in trouble with God I
[1:18:21] don't want to do that that's the reason
[1:18:23] I kept it one by one and watch closely
[1:18:27] pass by now tonight Discerning line not
[1:18:30] inment but just pray you've got
[1:18:33] unconfessed sin in your life come the
[1:18:35] line before you make it right now then
[1:18:37] if you have when you pass by here by
[1:18:41] just say I'm going up and let brother
[1:18:44] Brandon pray for me get that way off
[1:18:46] your
[1:18:47] mind the thing to do is know that you're

[1:18:53] Made You amen very important that God
[1:18:58] Made You The Promise personally by his
[1:19:02] word not just for brother Brandon to
[1:19:04] pray or the minister to pray but God
[1:19:06] Made You the promise and when you come
[1:19:09] by faith knowing that God made you a
[1:19:11] promise he gave you something which is
[1:19:13] called Faith to say hey if I go up there

[1:19:49] don't know then you're not saved but God
[1:19:51] will make your body obey your confession
[1:19:55] and he is the high priest of our
[1:19:57] confession see and uh he's the high
[1:19:59] priest of our confession before you can
[1:20:01] be healed you have to confess it first
[1:20:05] somebody say first first not wait until
[1:20:08] you see the change but confess it first
[1:20:12] say God has already healed my body God
[1:20:16] has already saved me the work is already

[1:20:46] confession be negative let your
[1:20:49] confession be POS don't let your conf be
[1:20:53] low but let your
[1:20:55] be high in the word of God that's
[1:20:58] right because whatever you confess
[1:21:01] that's what's going to
[1:21:03] happen shared with the youth on Sunday
[1:21:06] the other week you know if you hang
[1:21:08] around with negative people you become
[1:21:12] negative you know if you hang around a
[1:21:14] certain h a certain person that's a
[1:21:16] certain way you're going to become that
[1:21:17] way in your own life also you hang
[1:21:20] around someone that never has any money
[1:21:22] you're never going to have any money
[1:21:24] you're always going to be giving them
[1:21:26] your
[1:21:29] money amen negativity breeds
[1:21:34] negativity unbelief breeds unbelief but
[1:21:38] positivity bre
[1:21:40] positivity Faith breeds faith in your
[1:21:44] life low in faith tomorrow morning up
[1:21:48] somebody that you know and energized and
[1:21:52] and get to talking to them for sure
[1:21:54] enough when you hang up you're going to
[1:21:56] say wow I feel I feel good I feel I feel
[1:22:00] like my faith is why because faith
[1:22:03] energizes
[1:22:09] faith so he says here continuing on with
[1:22:12] this quote and then when you believe
[1:22:14] you're healed God makes your body obey
[1:22:16] your confession so now when you come
[1:22:18] here by here just let it be settled say
[1:22:22] God this is your
[1:22:25] command I believe I'm Healed and walk
[1:22:28] off the
[1:22:31] platform
[1:22:33] Allelujah unconfessed sin I won't dwell
[1:22:36] upon this for very
[1:22:37] long but so much of the time we think of
[1:22:40] unconfessed sin as drinking and smoking
[1:22:43] and and and and and adultery and all
[1:22:46] different things and we think of that as
[1:22:48] the the great sin we just share this
[1:22:52] that a spin of a sin of end
[1:22:55] there's a sin of jealousy there's
[1:22:57] there's a sin of having hate against
[1:22:59] somebody for no reason and all these
[1:23:01] things and what is the smoking and the
[1:23:04] cigarettes things you know what it is
[1:23:05] it's all
[1:23:06] outward and everybody can see easy to
[1:23:09] see and when you really get converted
[1:23:11] and it it just falls off of you but
[1:23:15] still within this sticky nature there's
[1:23:17] things that we deal with that we must
[1:23:20] confess we must confess of our high
[1:23:23] temper we must confess of these
[1:23:25] different things of saying things and
[1:23:27] thinking things that we oughtn't to be
[1:23:31] thinking Hallelujah it goes beyond out
[1:23:35] here to down into the holiest of holies
[1:23:38] in our lives down into our heart a lot
[1:23:42] of times it's not this is just the
[1:23:44] outward
[1:23:45] expression of what's really going on
[1:23:51] here there's something wrong
[1:23:55] heart some the line that
[1:23:59] needs and I surgeon but is a heart
[1:24:04] surgeon and if you would just open to
[1:24:07] the Holy Spirit and say father I have my
[1:24:11] heart that only you care of the preacher
[1:24:14] can't take care of it no one else can
[1:24:17] take care of it only you can take care
[1:24:19] of it I'm upon the operating table
[1:24:21] tonight Lord come and have your way and
[1:24:24] operate on this Stony heart father
[1:24:28] God and believe with all your heart and
[1:24:31] watch God take care of
[1:24:34] it so the first thing that will cause uh
[1:24:37] God to be silent in our lives is
[1:24:41] unconfessed the second thing that God
[1:24:43] does that God is silent in our lives and
[1:24:47] we all know this very well and that he
[1:24:50] wants to test us to see the kind of real
[1:24:54] that we're going to have El like this
[1:24:57] same paragraph
[1:24:59] 42 they're they're
[1:25:03] uh I'll read it again I did this twice
[1:25:06] that's okay if you prayed amid all the
[1:25:10] god requires you to meet and still he's
[1:25:13] silent doesn't say anything and yet
[1:25:15] you've met the requirements now what
[1:25:17] happens then in other words uh
[1:25:20] requirement of God is is is is getting
[1:25:22] converted and giving your heart to
[1:25:24] Christ and being baptized and having the
[1:25:26] Holy Ghost and you've met the
[1:25:27] requirements you've confessed your sin
[1:25:29] to God there's really nothing your heart
[1:25:31] doesn't condemn you therefore now you
[1:25:34] should have an audience with God and if
[1:25:36] he's still
[1:25:38] silent what
[1:25:40] then if you know that you have met his
[1:25:42] requirements and done all that you know
[1:25:44] to do then Faith doesn't
[1:25:48] waver it just sits still and thinks
[1:25:52] postive faith it's Everlasting grip
[1:25:56] around of
[1:25:57] Ages doesn't
[1:26:02] move great fellow called faith of said
[1:26:05] Faith got hair when he speaks everything
[1:26:08] else when faith says then everything
[1:26:11] else stops the boss and she met every
[1:26:15] requirement she had lived clean she had
[1:26:17] lived decent she lived honorable and she
[1:26:19] had met all of God's requirements but
[1:26:21] looked like he was silent God does that
[1:26:24] some time to test you to see what kind
[1:26:26] of a reaction you'll have and then he
[1:26:29] says don't forget
[1:26:33] it don't forget it that if you've met
[1:26:36] all of God's requirements and you're
[1:26:38] standing before God and you're you're
[1:26:40] you're praying to God for a touch in
[1:26:42] your body or whatever it may be brother
[1:26:45] brandham said Faith doesn't
[1:26:48] move faith
[1:26:51] stay Faith quiet and RS upon that rock
[1:26:55] of agent Rock of uh of of of salvation
[1:27:00] of Revelation that we have that Stripes
[1:27:03] guess what already
[1:27:06] healed by the blood of Jesus Christ live
[1:27:09] a Sanctified life because that's what
[1:27:11] the blood does and by faith in God we
[1:27:15] can believe for our Salvation amen Amen
[1:27:20] brother Bram says the blood does not
[1:27:21] save you sanctifies you from your sin
[1:27:25] it's faith in the finished work what
[1:27:28] saves
[1:27:29] you direct quote go look it
[1:27:32] up but he says she met all the
[1:27:35] requirements God does that so to test
[1:27:38] you to see what reaction you'll have
[1:27:41] don't foret it I I wonder why would he
[1:27:44] say don't
[1:27:46] for so easy for us to
[1:27:49] forget it's so easy for us as we're
[1:27:52] going through life have the ups and
[1:27:54] downs of life we have troubles and we
[1:27:57] have trials tribulations and temptations
[1:28:00] whatever it is that comes out of life
[1:28:02] and and and and and and issues and
[1:28:04] health issues and money issues and
[1:28:06] family issues and and there's just life
[1:28:08] is complicated and it's just so many
[1:28:11] issues it's easy to forget why we're
[1:28:14] going through the
[1:28:16] test and it's easy to take on instead of
[1:28:19] taking the mind of Christ it's easy to
[1:28:22] take the mind of Satan yeah and we begin
[1:28:25] to
[1:28:26] think he doesn't love
[1:28:29] me this
[1:28:32] ain't they don't care God don't God is
[1:28:36] silent he spoke to me I've been and I've
[1:28:40] been praying I've been confessing my sin
[1:28:43] and trying to do what's right and and
[1:28:45] God's requirements but yet but one issue
[1:28:48] after another it's after another and it
[1:28:51] just feels going round a roundabout get
[1:28:54] off this roundabout to get on the
[1:28:55] straight and narrow way you don't
[1:28:59] care what's the
[1:29:02] point it's easy to forget the why within
[1:29:05] the trial it's easy to forget the why
[1:29:08] within the when we are surrounded by the
[1:29:12] tests and the of
[1:29:19] lusia
[1:29:21] Hallelujah I'm just glad that I don't
[1:29:24] get my identity Satan amen I don't get
[1:29:28] my identity I am and where I came from
[1:29:31] and where I and who I am right now is
[1:29:33] the son of because of some thought that
[1:29:35] Satan tries to give me because of my
[1:29:37] carnal mind that's nothing but enmity
[1:29:40] with
[1:29:41] God the wisdom of
[1:29:44] man but the wisdom of God say
[1:29:48] walk
[1:29:52] faith not by what you
[1:29:56] think by what you think
[1:29:58] you not by
[1:30:00] yours but you walk by
[1:30:05] faith that's simple that's why I
[1:30:09] like cuz I'm simple
[1:30:12] person I'm what's known as a
[1:30:17] simpleton I don't know what that
[1:30:21] is is that even a word it's it's just
[1:30:24] like uh worser you know some kind of
[1:30:27] word is worser
[1:30:30] Stephen I'm a worser
[1:30:33] [Laughter]
[1:30:38] simpleton
[1:30:40] Hallelujah the same sermon
[1:30:43] 1960 let me let me let me just share
[1:30:46] this brother says don't forget it so
[1:30:49] it's not because you're not a God or
[1:30:52] that God love love you but it's actually
[1:30:55] quite the opposite because every son and
[1:30:59] every child son and daughter of God that
[1:31:01] to God must first be Ted tried and
[1:31:06] proven so if you're through the test and
[1:31:09] you're going another test and you're
[1:31:11] going through test guess what it's a
[1:31:13] pretty good sign that you are a child of
[1:31:16] God don't forget
[1:31:20] it God tests us to see if if we really
[1:31:24] mean from our heart what your lips are
[1:31:28] saying he's going to test it you say you
[1:31:31] believe in God you're going to be tested
[1:31:34] you believe that God can bring the home
[1:31:36] you're going to be tested you believe in
[1:31:39] healing you're tested if you say that
[1:31:43] God meets all of your you're going to be
[1:31:45] tested all of your
[1:31:48] needs I have
[1:31:52] found God has has never
[1:31:55] left with not
[1:31:59] enough sometimes the bank account can
[1:32:01] look good and other times it can look
[1:32:04] pretty
[1:32:05] embarrassing other times the vehicle can
[1:32:08] be going good and other times not so
[1:32:11] good but I have realized that through
[1:32:15] life and the things that we go through
[1:32:17] that I know how it is to be a
[1:32:20] based I know how it is to be
[1:32:24] exalted yes whatever I find myself in I
[1:32:30] am going to tent because I know that all
[1:32:34] things are working together for the good
[1:32:37] my life
[1:32:41] Hallelujah this same Ser paragraph 60 he
[1:32:46] demanded of of testimony of your healing
[1:32:50] you you might not know it but just hang
[1:32:53] on when you are sure that you've met all
[1:32:55] the requirements when you know that
[1:32:57] you've done everything that you know to
[1:32:59] do and laid yourself before God there's
[1:33:02] only one thing to do is hang on to his
[1:33:06] promise then stay there God promised to
[1:33:10] answer he'll do it that's right it's not
[1:33:14] something have to drum up it's not that
[1:33:17] we have to work up amount of faith in
[1:33:21] our Liv believe for something but
[1:33:23] believe it and stay right there hang on
[1:33:27] to it he'll do it why because he has
[1:33:30] promised that he's going do it so we're
[1:33:33] not depending upon our own promises
[1:33:36] because we can make promises and we can
[1:33:39] break promises but with God when he says
[1:33:42] when he gives a promise within his word
[1:33:44] it is yay and it is amen it will never
[1:33:48] fail that's
[1:33:49] right thank you Lord as the musicians
[1:33:52] come please
[1:33:54] so many times we like to say
[1:33:58] oh how I would love to just be in the
[1:34:02] time of
[1:34:03] Jesus when Jesus walked the shore
[1:34:07] Galilee when Jus give the blind back
[1:34:10] side when Jesus did Jesus Jesus spoke
[1:34:14] voice and this person was set and this
[1:34:17] person who was was found in their right
[1:34:20] mind and oh I would just love to be
[1:34:23] presence of Jes Jesus Christ how I would
[1:34:25] have loved to have been the times of the
[1:34:28] disciples that when people walk past
[1:34:31] their very shadow that Faith arose in
[1:34:33] their
[1:34:34] lives and they were healed all because
[1:34:38] of the shadow of a person oh Lord how
[1:34:41] great it would have been to have been in
[1:34:44] those
[1:34:46] days but I want to remind you that that
[1:34:49] same go that was back then that same go
[1:34:53] that was in that same God that was in
[1:34:56] disciples is the same God that is here
[1:34:59] tonight the same God that is in you he
[1:35:03] is the same God that is in your he is
[1:35:05] the same God that within me and there he
[1:35:09] does the same

[1:35:15] Lord every promise in the book is mine
[1:35:18] amen every
[1:35:19] chapter every verse every line

[1:35:27] divine every promise in the book is mine
[1:35:31] thank you Lord whether it be a promise
[1:35:33] of Salvation whether it be a promise of
[1:35:36] healing in our bodies the prodal
[1:35:39] returning whatever it may be overcoming
[1:35:42] something within your
[1:35:45] life the promise is still

[1:36:05] nervous anxious don't worry how it's
[1:36:08] going to come to
[1:36:09] pass if you've met

[1:36:15] not put it in God's hands and walk by
[1:36:20] faith yes put it in the hands of God and
[1:36:23] move on and say father I'm going to

[1:37:01] that or is he silent because you're
