[39:11] preach Good Tidings to the
[39:14] meek he has sent me to bind up the
[39:18] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[39:22] captives yes and the opening of prison
[39:26] to them that are

[39:32] couple of
[39:34] those words right there want you to take
[39:37] notice of what he said he's going to
[39:39] preach the
[39:41] gospel and he has sent me to bind up the
[39:45] Brokenhearted to bind up the
[39:48] Brokenhearted Luke chap

[39:59] this is now the New
[40:00] Testament version of Christ taking that
[40:05] book there was delivered unto him the
[40:08] book of The Prophet isaas or

[40:16] book you know he loves to open
[40:22] books he loves to Open Eyes

[40:57] them that are
[41:00] bruised notice he has sent me to heal
[41:04] the
[41:05] brokenhearted turn with me to one more
[41:07] scripture Book of
[41:09] Psalms
[41:11] Psalms 69
[41:27] verses
[41:28] 20 and
[41:31] 21
[41:33] reproach hath broken my
[41:36] heart and I am full of
[41:39] heaviness and I
[41:41] looked for
[41:43] some to take pity but there was
[41:48] none and for
[41:51] comforters but I found
[41:54] none they gave me also Gul for my
[41:59] meat and in my thirst they gave me
[42:02] vinegar to drink here is
[42:05] David having the anointing of God upon
[42:09] him and he is
[42:11] portraying the very enactment of Christ
[42:14] himself there at
[42:17] Calvary and he says
[42:20] reproach hath
[42:22] broken my
[42:24] heart father God
[42:28] now as we have read your word I pray let
[42:31] the anointing of God Almighty come down
[42:34] upon each and every one of us father
[42:37] give us great Revelation that only comes
[42:39] by way of your Holy Spirit father we
[42:42] thank you we praise you we ask these
[42:44] things for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[42:47] name amen amen God bless you you can be
[42:49] seated this morning in the presence of
[42:52] the
[42:54] Lord
[42:56] hallelujah I would like to take a title
[43:00] this
[43:01] morning healing the
[43:04] Brokenhearted and I want to take a
[43:07] subject which is a very vast
[43:11] subject the
[43:13] issues of the
[43:16] heart
[43:21] and there's so much that I could say
[43:24] this morning about the heart the Bible
[43:25] is full of scriptures about the
[43:29] heart in fact we
[43:32] started
[43:34] singing prepare our
[43:36] hearts then we saying create in me a
[43:39] clean
[43:42] heart God help
[43:44] us to watch over our hearts not only our
[43:48] hearts but the hearts of others God help
[43:51] us to measure our words and the words
[43:53] that we say let them be yay and nay
[44:00] and so it's
[44:04] important to look at this this morning
[44:07] and I thought I just share with you a
[44:09] couple things before I go into the depth
[44:14] of my sermon but the Bible speaks about
[44:17] the conditions of the heart in many
[44:20] ways it talks
[44:24] about how not to harden your heart
[44:30] that you're to have a clean heart you're
[44:32] to have a pure
[44:34] heart you're to
[44:37] have a circumcised
[44:41] heart and you're to have a forgiving
[44:46] heart because the attributes of the
[44:49] heart when you begin to look at
[44:51] it and as I was studying I found out
[44:54] that fear love
[44:57] courage anger Joy sorrow hatred are all
[45:05] ascribed to the heart in the Old
[45:09] Testament they are attributes they are
[45:13] issues of the
[45:16] heart but today I wish to focus on one
[45:19] thing one part of that heart and that is
[45:22] the broken
[45:24] heart Webster says
[45:27] a brokenhearted
[45:29] person is a person overcome by
[45:33] grief or
[45:37] Despair and I asked the question can you
[45:40] die of a broken
[45:42] heart yes you can it is a very rare
[45:47] occasion in fact the doctors say that
[45:51] it's about
[45:52] 1% of all of those that have what is
[45:55] called a broken heart some people become
[45:57] so
[45:59] grieved so broken in
[46:02] spirit so emotionally
[46:06] stressed that they can't crawl out of
[46:10] it and they die of a broken
[46:17] heart when you experience emotional or
[46:21] traumatic events in your life your
[46:24] nervous system
[46:25] triggers stress
[46:28] hormones like adrenaline
[46:35] and epinephrine some of these words I
[46:38] don't know you got to be a pharmacist or
[46:39] a
[46:41] doctor we know that that's normal but
[46:44] rarely and for some
[46:47] reason we can't fully understand that
[46:51] sometimes a person will be under such a
[46:54] load such a stress
[46:57] that they can experience a heart
[47:00] like attack or a heart attack
[47:06] symptom it's actually got a doctor's
[47:09] name for it broken heart
[47:12] syndrome a more formally called stress
[47:17] cardiomyopathy another word is
[47:22] Taco Tu subo must be a Japanese guy who
[47:27] discovered at
[47:31] cardiomyopathy and it can be in an
[47:33] emergency
[47:35] situation that requires prompt medical
[47:40] attention emotional stress
[47:45] response as a heartbreak triggers
[47:47] intense emotional
[47:50] stress activating the body's stress
[47:53] response system this involves the
[47:55] release of stress hormones like cortisol
[47:59] and adrenaline which can lead to
[48:03] physical symptoms in the
[48:06] body which doctors call psychosomatic
[48:11] pain the brain can manifest emotional
[48:14] pain as physical Sensations such as they
[48:19] might call it a ghost pain nothing wrong
[48:22] with the foot and yet the foot feels
[48:25] pain
[48:28] and
[48:29] uh then I looked at what about healing a
[48:32] broken heart what does it
[48:36] take it says it takes
[48:40] time it takes
[48:43] self-care and
[48:47] patience you have to start allowing
[48:50] yourself to feel your emotions without
[48:52] judgment
[48:56] it's truly okay to grieve it is okay to
[49:00] cry it is okay to release some of these
[49:05] emotions but then there comes a time
[49:08] where you wash your face you take a deep
[49:10] breath and
[49:12] say
[49:13] okay let's go
[49:17] on otherwise you will dig the hole so
[49:22] deep the wall will become so high the
[49:26] moment will be become so
[49:28] dark that you cannot see a way
[49:33] out and some people
[49:35] live even as mbth did in a place called
[49:42] loar loab bar is a place of no
[49:46] communication
[49:50] right in a place of
[49:52] isolation that's what they do to
[49:55] prisoners when when they really want to
[49:58] control them if the guy's acting up put
[50:00] him in isolation for about 3 months no
[50:03] contact No Light No nothing just give
[50:06] him the food through a slot the door and
[50:08] that's
[50:12] it the Bible speaks many times about
[50:15] broken
[50:16] arts and its effect upon the
[50:20] person and I just want to show you a few
[50:23] quotes and like I said this is a vast
[50:26] subject the heart and there's so many
[50:30] avenues that we could take whether of a
[50:33] condemning heart a callous heart or
[50:36] whatever but I wish to focus on one
[50:39] thing this morning A Broken
[50:43] Heart the Bible says in Psalms 341
[50:47] 18-19 the Lord is n unto them that are
[50:50] of a broken
[50:52] heart and save as such of be a contrite
[50:56] SP
[50:57] Spirit many are the afflictions of the
[51:00] righteous but the Lord
[51:02] [Music]
[51:18] deliverthat together the outcasts of
[51:22] Israel he Health the broken in heart and
[51:26] bindeth up their
[51:29] wounds he tth the number of the
[51:33] stars and calleth them all by their
[51:38] names think of
[51:40] that Abraham thy seed shall be like the
[51:43] Sand by the seash
[51:45] shore or look up into the heavens and
[51:49] they shall be like the stars in the
[51:51] heavens you realize that every part of
[51:54] that heavenly
[51:57] Celestial
[52:01] hemisphere has to do with God and his
[52:04] Bible because that's God's first Bible
[52:08] no wonder he would number the stars and
[52:10] name
[52:11] them isn't it amazing have you ever laid
[52:15] back on the grass out in the field away
[52:18] from the city and looked up at the
[52:21] stars and for some straight reason you
[52:25] have an offend towards a certain
[52:29] star maybe that's your
[52:33] star there's something about the
[52:35] attraction of the
[52:40] heavens
[52:43] amen now the prophet speaks
[52:47] about a broken heart and let me read to
[52:51] you a quote here of what he said because
[52:55] again this is a very vast subject but I
[52:58] want to just go in
[53:00] here I'm going to read just the
[53:03] highlighted portion of this quote in the
[53:05] mighty
[53:06] conqueror 1956 the Bible
[53:10] said that his blood and water separated
[53:13] from each
[53:14] other and any doctor or any thing can
[53:18] tell you that knows that chemistry of
[53:22] the blood that only sorrow will do that
[53:26] he never
[53:27] died from a Roman
[53:34] spear neither did he
[53:37] die from a nail droven his
[53:42] hands or his
[53:45] feet but he died of a broken
[53:50] heart being
[53:55] rejected he he came to his
[53:58] own and his own received him
[54:02] not Jesus
[54:05] Christ
[54:06] died of a broken
[54:13] heart anyone that's ever gone through
[54:16] such a traumatic thing such as having
[54:18] your heart
[54:21] broken it's
[54:24] traumatizing it is
[54:27] is almost a near-death experience
[54:30] because you will
[54:32] cry until you can cry no more you will
[54:35] moan and
[54:38] groan there will be a pain it will be as
[54:41] though you're dying in fact you may
[54:43] during this time say Lord why don't you
[54:45] just take me
[54:47] home I can't
[54:50] handle the pressure
[54:58] brother Brenham in questions and
[55:02] answers when Jesus suffered in that body
[55:06] he
[55:07] suffered because a man and a woman are
[55:10] one person Eve was taken out of Adam and
[55:14] the church what happened God opened up
[55:18] the side of Adam and took out their
[55:21] helpmate the bride and God opened up the
[55:26] side of Jesus at Calvary and took out
[55:30] the bride and see when Jesus died at
[55:33] Calvary the B the bride was taken from
[55:37] the
[55:38] body excuse me was not taken from the
[55:42] body until the body was dead he'd
[55:45] already died see so they draw back the
[55:49] hammer to break his leg and a man run up
[55:51] with a spear and pushed it through his
[55:53] heart and water and blood came
[55:59] forth now some doctors got together who
[56:03] are
[56:06] cardiologists and they took the part
[56:08] they said where water and blood came out
[56:11] because the sword or the spear pierced
[56:15] up through his cavity up into the heart
[56:20] area and the doctor said
[56:24] this that Jesus literally died from a
[56:27] broken
[56:28] heart with the collapse of the ruptured
[56:32] heart cavity resulting in a separation
[56:37] of the raw watery
[56:40] serum from the clotted blood in the
[56:45] pericardium it's
[56:49] amazing so his heart literally
[56:54] broke it rubs
[56:58] it gave way like an egg with a shell
[57:01] cracked something opened and came
[57:07] out the chastisement of our peace was
[57:11] upon
[57:13] him he was stricken of
[57:17] God and beaten he was forsaken smitten
[57:21] and
[57:23] bruised he was forsaken by God and man
[57:27] because on the cross he said Eli Eli
[57:34] L he suffered so much that he said my
[57:38] God why hast Thou forsaken me forsaken
[57:44] by man and by
[57:47] God and there was the man Christ Jesus
[57:50] now brother Brenham answers you cannot
[57:52] kill God
[57:56] he said so the spirit of God had to
[57:58] leave the man Christ
[58:03] Jesus when he was in The Garden of
[58:08] Gethsemane and he knew what was before
[58:11] him for this cause came I into the
[58:15] world but he said let this cup pass from
[58:20] me
[58:23] nevertheless thy will be done
[58:26] and as he prayed he prayed so earnestly
[58:30] and under such
[58:32] pressure that drops of
[58:35] blood came forth from his very skin on
[58:39] his
[58:40] brow can you imagine such
[58:46] pressure and that here he
[58:48] was in The Garden of
[58:51] Gethsemane and the garden is a wine
[58:54] garden and what do you do with wine you
[58:58] crush the
[59:01] grape and God is
[59:04] crushing the very grape of
[59:08] God to bring forth a life Fruit from
[59:13] you
[59:15] oh help me Lord this
[59:19] morning as I speak to your
[59:24] people now we've got quite a few here in
[59:29] our church that are in the medical field
[59:32] and you just kind of bear with me a
[59:35] little bit because I'm not a doctor I'm
[59:36] not trained in these things but let me
[59:39] just say some things that I have
[59:42] noticed physical
[59:44] trauma to the outside of the body you
[59:47] can immediately see the effects of it if
[59:51] somebody breaks their arm and it's
[59:52] hanging down here oh you have a broken
[59:55] arm if somebody has got a laceration on
[1:00:00] their skull oh you need
[1:00:03] stitches different thing if you've broke
[1:00:05] your leg those are
[1:00:08] manifestations to the outward body that
[1:00:11] you can see they're
[1:00:13] traumatizing and they need immediate
[1:00:17] fixing but I want to ask you what about
[1:00:20] that which is on the inside of the body
[1:00:24] that you cannot see
[1:00:27] the part of the body
[1:00:30] that how can you see
[1:00:33] depression how can you see anxiety how
[1:00:36] can you see
[1:00:40] suicide how can you see
[1:00:43] depression or anger or something that's
[1:00:47] pent up and the so many of God's
[1:00:51] people are hemorrhaging
[1:00:56] are hurting within they are going
[1:01:00] through the
[1:01:03] pace oh how are you doing I'm fine by
[1:01:06] his
[1:01:07] grace
[1:01:09] yeah don't ask him a second question
[1:01:12] because they
[1:01:13] might just burst out in
[1:01:16] tears no really how you
[1:01:24] doing so so when you look at depression
[1:01:28] anxiety
[1:01:30] loneliness they cannot be discovered by
[1:01:33] looking at the physical person it's not
[1:01:36] it's not something oh you might see a s
[1:01:38] sad countenance or you know the lower
[1:01:41] lip hanging down
[1:01:46] whatever but you can't find it with an
[1:01:48] x-ray or a CAT scan or an
[1:01:54] MRI yes there are sign that one might
[1:01:57] recognize that somebody's
[1:02:02] depressed you might see by their
[1:02:04] countenance by the way they
[1:02:08] walk you you ever watch people at the
[1:02:13] mall or at the airport I'm a people
[1:02:17] Watcher my wife's a shopper she shops
[1:02:20] she's when she's in her Zone she's in
[1:02:22] her Zone when I'm out there I'll sit
[1:02:24] I'll tell her you go in I'll sit right
[1:02:27] here and I watch all the people go by
[1:02:29] and you watch and here here comes a you
[1:02:31] know somebody like this and you can see
[1:02:32] they're they're on their way they're
[1:02:34] doing something huh they're happy right
[1:02:36] and then you see somebody
[1:02:39] else you know like e
[1:02:43] or oh is me everything is wrong why did
[1:02:49] I get up this
[1:02:52] morning you can just you know uh
[1:02:56] kind of discerned by the way they walk
[1:02:59] The Talk The
[1:03:05] countenance but many times our physical
[1:03:08] sicknesses are brought about because
[1:03:11] of heart
[1:03:14] issues because of
[1:03:16] stress that we're
[1:03:18] under comes out in a physical
[1:03:22] way oh yeah many times
[1:03:26] you may look normal on the outside but
[1:03:28] inside you're
[1:03:31] hemorrhaging you're really going through
[1:03:35] something but when the spirit discerns
[1:03:38] the problem the person is having all
[1:03:42] kinds of physical problems because now
[1:03:45] the spirit's
[1:03:48] Discerning that it's not a
[1:03:51] physical though it's manifesting in
[1:03:54] physical form
[1:03:56] but the cause is a wounded
[1:04:00] spirit is a broken
[1:04:06] heart yes many of our physical ailments
[1:04:09] we bring upon ourselves we

[1:14:42] day that don't have outward

[1:16:07] medicine and they bury their
[1:16:11] mistakes and doctors that just give you
[1:16:14] a prescription instead of actually
[1:16:17] trying to find the
[1:16:19] cause are just doctors that are working
[1:16:22] for the big Pharmacy companies

[1:17:05] one to there's a pill for
[1:17:09] everything but I'll tell you about a
[1:17:11] pill that I want all of you to
[1:17:15] know that will heal everything you got
[1:17:19] and that's the
[1:17:21] gospel you find Jesus Christ and let him
[1:17:24] in into your life not that you won't
[1:17:27] have issues not that you won't go
[1:17:29] through things but let me tell you he is
[1:17:31] the Healer of all your diseases he is
[1:17:34] the comfort in in all of your stress he
[1:17:37] is the one that can calm the storm he is
[1:17:40] the one that can give you peace that
[1:17:42] will pass all understanding when all
[1:17:45] hell is breaking loose and everything is
[1:17:48] falling apart he's the one that holds
[1:17:52] your mind he's the one that binds CLE up
[1:17:55] your broken heart he's the one that
[1:17:57] keeps you
[1:18:00] together because you can't keep
[1:18:10] yourself now many times in the prayer
[1:18:14] line the person may look
[1:18:17] normal come up before the prophet of
[1:18:22] God but when the spirit begins to
[1:18:26] concern they see there's all kinds of
[1:18:32] problems even the Bible says in
[1:18:35] Deuteronomy 8 and5 it says Thou shalt
[1:18:38] also consider thine heart in other words
[1:18:41] you should know this in your heart
[1:18:43] Brethren that as a man chastises his son
[1:18:48] or chasen is his son so the Lord thy God
[1:18:52] chasen thee
[1:18:54] you want to beat on him you think you're
[1:18:56] going to beat the devil out of him then
[1:18:59] God's going to whack on
[1:19:04] you you know that that's what the Bible
[1:19:09] says brother Brenham said
[1:19:11] never never correct your children in
[1:19:15] Anger
[1:19:17] right he said you grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:19:20] you grieve its
[1:19:21] Angel
[1:19:23] huh now now most of the time you can't
[1:19:26] see the problem on the
[1:19:28] outside because it's a problem of the
[1:19:30] heart or the spirit in prayer lines you
[1:19:33] see so many times the people coming
[1:19:36] forward to be prayed for and sometimes
[1:19:39] it's a condemning heart they're coming
[1:19:41] there many times a prayer line will have
[1:19:43] many people there and they're just there
[1:19:46] for relief from something they've done
[1:19:49] and it's condemned their heart the Bible
[1:19:51] says if our hearts condemn us
[1:19:55] okay then we we don't have peace with
[1:19:58] God but a heart that is not condemned
[1:20:01] then I have peace towards God you see a
[1:20:05] prayer line isn't just coming up here
[1:20:06] because you did something wrong let them
[1:20:08] pray you know and cry a little bit and
[1:20:10] it's all over no confess you're wrong
[1:20:14] make it right before you come up to be
[1:20:16] prayed for God can't even heal
[1:20:19] you until you do those things
[1:20:22] first repent
[1:20:26] make those things
[1:20:28] right and then come and get prayed for
[1:20:31] and then watch God heal you
[1:20:33] instantly I've seen people and myself
[1:20:36] included the moment you stand up before
[1:20:39] you even get prayed for you're
[1:20:43] healed
[1:20:47] amen brother Brenham so much of the time
[1:20:50] hundreds and hundreds thousands of times
[1:20:55] as he breaks into a vision
[1:20:59] oh I see
[1:21:01] you there's a lot of trouble on your
[1:21:04] heart
[1:21:05] oh you're having marital problems your
[1:21:09] husband this this then all of a sudden
[1:21:12] he shakes his head are those things true
[1:21:15] of course I don't know what I said that
[1:21:18] was
[1:21:19] him I'll tell you all of these
[1:21:22] Skeptics let me just give you an answer
[1:21:24] to all of
[1:21:25] these shimmy
[1:21:29] eyes of recent that like to stand up 50
[1:21:32] years after the prophets off the scene
[1:21:35] and now they want to find all these
[1:21:36] things they would have never done it by
[1:21:39] standing with him in the Pulpit come up
[1:21:41] here and challenge him most of the time
[1:21:44] he says hey you preachers you you say
[1:21:46] I'm wrong you come up here and stand
[1:21:49] right here next to me with the Bible and
[1:21:51] he says show me where I'm wrong
[1:21:54] I said none of you moved he said you're
[1:21:56] smarter than I thought you know the
[1:21:59] angel of the Lord stands right here next
[1:22:01] to me so much of the time he oh let me
[1:22:04] tell you so all of these shimy eyes

[1:26:04] Rejoice god brother am amen did you see
[1:26:09] Billy Paul what I told you how he'd get
[1:26:12] up behind his daddy grab his Bible now
[1:26:14] he's holding him because he's he's
[1:26:16] resting in his arms and he's letting the
[1:26:19] the other minister know I'm taking him
[1:26:21] away but do you see the discernment it
[1:26:24] would just go one after another after
[1:26:26] another and he began to discern I want
[1:26:29] you to understand that that is the
[1:26:31] discernment of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:26:33] Bible says that the word of
[1:26:35] God is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:26:39] the intents of the heart even to the
[1:26:42] dividing
[1:26:44] aunder how many believe
[1:26:49] that oh my the prophet talks about heart
[1:26:53] trouble listen to me I
[1:26:58] studied
[1:27:01] 1,179 times heart
[1:27:04] trouble that he discerns in people and
[1:27:08] much of the time it's not a clogged
[1:27:11] heart it's heart trouble you got an
[1:27:16] issue right you've been
[1:27:20] heartbroken you're depressed you're
[1:27:23] lonely
[1:27:25] you're just out of sorts
[1:27:31] yes and then the next one another
[1:27:35] sickness that has more hits than that is
[1:27:38] cancer because he said this a cancer age
[1:27:42] and he says he says what is it it's a
[1:27:45] spirit and it starts by being wounded
[1:27:48] it's a wounded or bruised cell it's what
[1:27:51] he said and what it does
[1:27:54] huh and he says and there Cancers and
[1:27:58] different things within the body and the
[1:28:00] prophet of God just exposing Spirits
[1:28:04] he's Discerning
[1:28:06] Spirits so here's the first quote that I
[1:28:08] want to show you because brother Brandon
[1:28:10] remember as Moses was given two signs
[1:28:14] the sign in the hand and the discernment
[1:28:16] of spirit I want you to see here it is
[1:28:19] in the sermon experiences 1947 this is
[1:28:22] the first quote on brother Brenham
[1:28:25] talking about heart trouble just to give
[1:28:28] you an example all right you have the
[1:28:31] quote
[1:28:34] ready now she's suffering with a heart
[1:28:37] trouble which is causing a block in her
[1:28:40] heart and she's
[1:28:42] got asthmatic trouble also she's
[1:28:45] extremely nervous a deep thinker a real
[1:28:50] worry about things before it happens any
[1:28:54] body in here like that huh oh my what
[1:28:58] are we going to do when we get there how
[1:29:00] long will it take what what if this and
[1:29:02] what if that ah you may never get
[1:29:09] there see you must have a very good
[1:29:14] faith or
[1:29:15] something where are you
[1:29:18] from
[1:29:20] Superior is that Arizona is it why it's
[1:29:24] the first time that's the fourth person
[1:29:27] I've ever knowed that felt that
[1:29:29] vibration the reaction of it because now
[1:29:32] remember as Moses he's got a sign in the
[1:29:35] hand and it will actually vibrate and
[1:29:38] it'll turn a color and watch what he
[1:29:41] said he says now just bow your head and
[1:29:45] he tells his sister now you watch my
[1:29:47] hand
[1:29:48] sister so he's holding her
[1:29:52] hand and she's feeling the vibration
[1:29:55] said sister you watch my
[1:29:57] hand and if it turns back normal like
[1:30:00] this one
[1:30:02] here if that leaves or you can tell it
[1:30:06] when you
[1:30:06] feel you see when the feeling of that
[1:30:10] leaves and my hand will turn
[1:30:14] normal father I pray for this sister
[1:30:17] that you will healer thou demon I adure
[1:30:21] Thee by Jesus Christ the son of the
[1:30:25] Living God come out of the
[1:30:27] woman you don't feel it now do you look
[1:30:30] at my
[1:30:31] hand now you may raise your head
[1:30:35] audience that's stopped now hasn't it
[1:30:38] you don't feel it at all and here's my
[1:30:40] hand turned wide but in other words his
[1:30:42] hand went back to normal do you know
[1:30:44] that brother Billy Paul told me that um
[1:30:47] brother Brenham could never wear a watch
[1:30:49] during a time of discernment or praying
[1:30:51] for people he had a a sful of expensive
[1:30:56] watches that the moment the anointing of
[1:30:58] God was on him it had break every
[1:31:01] watch something Supernatural a
[1:31:04] power was going on how many believe it
[1:31:08] was God it was the power of God and he
[1:31:12] said he daddy could never wear a watch
[1:31:15] during those
[1:31:16] times
[1:31:18] now brother Brenham talks about these
[1:31:22] two signs that he had and he said he
[1:31:26] Likens it unto his first and second pull
[1:31:30] and he also Likens this under
[1:31:35] fishing you all know I've told you many
[1:31:40] times so many of the people coming to be
[1:31:43] prayed for were issues of the
[1:31:45] heart they're all burdened and troubled
[1:31:48] in their
[1:31:49] heart or they have a condemning heart
[1:31:52] because of sin
[1:31:54] brother ramam says oh I see you sis but
[1:31:56] let's just go into this anointed one
[1:32:00] 1965 and when this messenger not when he
[1:32:02] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:32:05] his message see the first pole healing
[1:32:09] what do that got to do with outer Court
[1:32:11] the
[1:32:12] body second poll prophecy what is that
[1:32:17] that's the
[1:32:19] spirit third poll the opening of the
[1:32:22] word the Mysteries revealed
[1:32:24] no more there is no more higher order to
[1:32:27] reveal that word than prophets but the
[1:32:30] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[1:32:33] is by the word and remember the third
[1:32:35] pole was the opening of them Seven Seals
[1:32:38] to reveal the hidden truth but that's
[1:32:40] been sealed in the word now Jesus Christ
[1:32:43] was the word of God was he
[1:32:45] not he was the seed Gene of God and when
[1:32:49] God broke him and broke his heart
[1:32:54] at
[1:32:55] Calvary all of the seed attributes of
[1:32:59] God that was inside encapsulated inside
[1:33:03] it broke open his heart and when that
[1:33:07] spear went through his side out came
[1:33:10] water and blood amen and he had given up
[1:33:14] the spirit water blood spirit
[1:33:17] constitutes what a birth and brother
[1:33:21] Brenham said there at Calvary Christ is
[1:33:24] birthing A Whole New Testament Church
[1:33:28] Hallelujah he's now birthing a whole new
[1:33:31] church his seed was poured out had Satan
[1:33:35] known what was happening he would have
[1:33:38] never let him died he would have
[1:33:40] protected him he would not have killed
[1:33:43] him but the seed if it remains
[1:33:47] alone it's got to
[1:33:49] die he had to die he was the seed he had
[1:33:55] to die he had to be planted he had to go
[1:33:58] down to Hell Hallelujah the keys of
[1:34:02] death and hell and he went down and took
[1:34:05] all of the Old Testament Saints sir
[1:34:13] amen so his heart
[1:34:16] ruptured I'm going to show you some
[1:34:18] quotes
[1:34:19] here Hebrews 4 and2 says the word of God
[1:34:23] is
[1:34:24] quick and
[1:34:26] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:34:29] sword piercing even to the dividing and
[1:34:32] suer of Soul and Spirit and of the
[1:34:35] joints of the marrow and the discerner
[1:34:37] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:34:40] so he discerned I want you to understand
[1:34:43] the the word of God that was coming to
[1:34:46] him was Discerning between Body Spirit
[1:34:49] and
[1:34:51] soul he said you can have have the
[1:34:54] spirit on your body and you feel it oh I
[1:34:57] feel the love of God oh but it doesn't
[1:35:00] change you that's the outer Court he
[1:35:04] said then you can go to the inner Court
[1:35:05] which is your
[1:35:08] spirit and he says and and there you can
[1:35:12] activate gifts of the Spirit you can
[1:35:15] prophesy you can do all those things
[1:35:17] speak in
[1:35:18] tongues that is not the evidence that
[1:35:22] you are sealed by the holy spirit it's
[1:35:24] in evidence that the spirit is there
[1:35:27] doing
[1:35:29] something that's
[1:35:32] all Caiaphas
[1:35:36] prophesied he didn't have the Holy
[1:35:39] Ghost
[1:35:43] so the Holy Spirit begins to discern
[1:35:46] among the
[1:35:48] Believers here's where the prophet of
[1:35:50] God said here's where Pentecost failed
[1:35:53] here's where these other religions have
[1:35:55] began to tell you this is the evidence
[1:35:58] of being baptized of the Holy
[1:36:02] Spirit he said it was not the operating
[1:36:05] of the gifts it wasn't Divine Healing
[1:36:07] speaking in
[1:36:09] tongues none of those are the evidence
[1:36:11] of the holy spirit let me give you three
[1:36:13] quotes here real quick let's just you
[1:36:15] Brothers follow along all I want to do
[1:36:17] is just give the highlighted portion
[1:36:19] pergam and church age I want you to note
[1:36:22] very carefully that Jesus did not say
[1:36:25] that the evidence of being baptized with
[1:36:27] the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:36:30] interpreting or prophesying or shouting
[1:36:33] and dancing he said the evidence would
[1:36:35] be that you would be in the truth amen
[1:36:39] that you would be in the word of God for
[1:36:41] your
[1:36:42] age evidence has to do with receiving
[1:36:45] the
[1:36:47] word evidence has to do with receiving
[1:36:51] the word how many of you have received
[1:36:53] the word of the Prophet when you've
[1:36:56] received the the uh uh the word of a
[1:36:58] prophet you've re you receive a
[1:37:01] prophet's
[1:37:03] reward now don't just say it with your
[1:37:05] oh yeah I I receive it no you got to
[1:37:08] take it into your heart I'm going to
[1:37:11] show you why it's Thy word oh Lord have
[1:37:14] a hid in my heart that I learn not to
[1:37:18] sin against you most people Miss serving
[1:37:22] God by about 18 inches from here to
[1:37:26] here because the greatest battle ever
[1:37:28] fought is in the mind not in the
[1:37:32] heart next quote p pergami in church age
[1:37:37] the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:37:39] today is just the same as it was back in
[1:37:42] the day of Our Lord it is the receiving
[1:37:45] the word of Truth for the day in which
[1:37:47] you live Jesus never did stress the
[1:37:50] importance of the works as he did the
[1:37:52] word
[1:37:55] he knew that if the people got the
[1:38:02] word if you got the word The Works
[1:38:05] follow that's right that's the
[1:38:08] Bible sardian Church age now I'm sure
[1:38:11] that you have noticed that those whose
[1:38:15] names are in the Book of Life Now notice
[1:38:18] Book of Life not Lamb's Book of
[1:38:20] Life Book of Life were a part of the
[1:38:25] religious order of that day that
[1:38:28] centered around the true God and worship
[1:38:30] of him though they did not worship
[1:38:33] according to the truth which is the
[1:38:38] word like Judas they didn't go all the
[1:38:41] way see how Judas was chosen of God he
[1:38:44] was instructed in
[1:38:46] truth he shared knowledge of the
[1:38:49] Mysteries he had a Ministry of power
[1:38:52] granted unto him and he he healed the
[1:38:54] sick and cast out devils in jesus' name
[1:38:58] but when The Showdown came he sold
[1:39:01] out for gold and political
[1:39:04] power he did not go up to
[1:39:07] Pentecost to receive the spirit of God
[1:39:10] he was devoid of the spirit make no
[1:39:13] mistakes about it a person that is truly
[1:39:15] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:39:19] of
[1:39:20] Christ receives the fullness of the
[1:39:22] spirit will be in the word all the way I
[1:39:27] didn't capitalize these I just
[1:39:29] highlighted them but that word all the
[1:39:32] way is in your church age book already
[1:39:35] capitalized that is the evidence of
[1:39:37] being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas
[1:39:40] failed multitudes right there fall right
[1:39:44] there and when they failed to go on in
[1:39:47] that word their names are taken off the
[1:39:50] Book of
[1:39:51] Life when they fa when you reject the
[1:39:55] word see there's a lot of people they
[1:39:58] ask brother Brandon well what about are
[1:39:59] there people going to be saved and a
[1:40:01] that don't follow your message oh yeah
[1:40:04] sure there's people all over the world
[1:40:06] that if they have a life with Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ but if they've come up to the
[1:40:10] word and they deny
[1:40:12] it he said they can't have the Holy
[1:40:15] Ghost because how can the Holy Ghost who
[1:40:18] is the author of the word how can the
[1:40:21] Holy Ghost deny the the very word it
[1:40:32] wrote let me say this please listen to
[1:40:37] it
[1:40:37] carefully those that leave the message
[1:40:40] though they had followed it for
[1:40:45] years never had the Holy
[1:40:48] Ghost impossible
[1:40:53] if they did they would still follow the
[1:40:55] word of the
[1:40:58] hour it might have been on their body or
[1:41:00] on their Spirit that's right done the
[1:41:03] works of the spirit done all this kind
[1:41:05] of stuff felted and oo and awe and all
[1:41:08] that jumped and
[1:41:10] shouted but let me tell
[1:41:13] you when you leave the word you leave
[1:41:18] Christ he is the
[1:41:21] word right
[1:41:27] now when Christ comes into your heart
[1:41:29] we're talking about heart
[1:41:30] issues when Christ comes into your heart
[1:41:34] he sits on the throne room of your
[1:41:39] heart how many of you know the three
[1:41:41] circles Body Spirit
[1:41:44] Soul he says that outer part he said you
[1:41:49] you're a three-part person Body Spirit
[1:41:52] and soul soul soul being the inside of
[1:41:55] the
[1:41:56] inside he said now you can have the
[1:41:59] anointing of you on your body and oh you
[1:42:01] feel good and you raise up your hands
[1:42:03] and oh praise God and all that he says
[1:42:07] you can let the sunshine shine on a rock
[1:42:11] and it feels all warm and fuzzy but it
[1:42:13] never brings life why there's no
[1:42:17] seed it
[1:42:19] feels the
[1:42:21] sunlight many of those those that go to
[1:42:23] church feel God's
[1:42:27] love oh love oh God is love and they sit
[1:42:33] there excuse me I'm not being critical
[1:42:36] but you have to understand and I'm going
[1:42:38] to show you and I I I I got a good
[1:42:41] another 25
[1:42:43] minutes my wife told me she says honey
[1:42:47] she gives me a kiss she says stay
[1:42:50] focused

[1:42:57] stories and she was walking away I said
[1:43:01] it sounds like Jill
[1:43:05] Biden I said I'm not that

[1:43:15] right anyway so I I try I try my wife's
[1:43:20] bless her heart I love her she just yeah
[1:43:22] she he's the better half of me that's
[1:43:25] for
[1:43:26] sure now watch this sits on the throne
[1:43:30] room of your heart watch this the
[1:43:31] infallible proof of the Resurrection the
[1:43:34] sin question settled when the Holy
[1:43:35] Spirit comes into the human heart where
[1:43:38] human
[1:43:41] heart it casts down reasoning it goes
[1:43:44] above your intellectual affair because
[1:43:47] there's an intellectual conception of
[1:43:50] Christ in other words it's in the mind
[1:43:52] and not in the
[1:43:55] heart but when he comes into the heart
[1:43:58] it's
[1:43:59] Faith what is Faith it's a revelation
[1:44:02] see it's positive there's no question
[1:44:05] about
[1:44:06] it it's all settled forever it's in your
[1:44:09] heart and your heart doesn't reason
[1:44:12] because it's the throne The Dwelling
[1:44:15] Place of the almighty in the
[1:44:19] heart when Christ sits on the throne
[1:44:22] room of your heart he goes from being
[1:44:25] Lord to
[1:44:27] master and you say and you call me
[1:44:30] master and Lord and you say well for so
[1:44:33] I am
[1:44:35] right many have him as Lord right very
[1:44:39] few have him as
[1:44:45] Master when your heart is united with
[1:44:48] the heart of
[1:44:51] God your heart and his heart become
[1:44:57] one brother Brenham says in a personal
[1:44:59] experience with God
[1:45:02] 1954 I come to find out that Christ is
[1:45:05] the very Heart Of
[1:45:08] God he is God's heart Jesus
[1:45:14] Christ is God's
[1:45:16] heart isn't that a lovely
[1:45:20] quote the very essence
[1:45:23] of all that was
[1:45:26] God he was the very heart the heart
[1:45:30] throb of God he was love he was healing
[1:45:34] he was virtue he was Kinsman he was all
[1:45:38] he was the very Heart Of God
[1:45:44] am Jesus Christ died then of a broken
[1:45:50] heart he came to preach the gospel to
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:54] poor he says and I am come to heal the
[1:45:59] brokenhearted aren't you glad that you
[1:46:01] have a God who can be touched by the
[1:46:04] feeling of your
[1:46:07] infirmities you ever been
[1:46:11] brokenhearted something so tragic so
[1:46:14] traumatic that you can't even share it
[1:46:17] with someone
[1:46:18] else a brother told me the other day he
[1:46:22] says something happened in my life I
[1:46:24] cried for he says I cried so hard I
[1:46:28] could not open my eyes for three
[1:46:32] days that's pretty traumatic would you
[1:46:36] say Amen to that yeah
[1:46:41] wow in the first
[1:46:44] seal now as we study the chapter we're
[1:46:47] referring to different places even to
[1:46:49] the Old and New Testament alike because
[1:46:51] the entire book is the revelation of
[1:46:54] Jesus Christ it's that's all together
[1:46:57] the revelation of the Lord Jesus the
[1:47:00] revelation of Jesus Christ it's God
[1:47:02] revealing himself in the book revealing
[1:47:05] himself through Christ in the book and
[1:47:08] Christ is the revelation of God and he
[1:47:11] comes to reveal God because he and God
[1:47:15] were the same God was in Christ
[1:47:17] reconciling the world to himself you'd
[1:47:19] never know just what God was until he
[1:47:22] reveal himself through Christ see Christ
[1:47:25] is the very Heart Of
[1:47:32] God let me be bold enough to say this
[1:47:35] too you would have never known the God
[1:47:37] of this
[1:47:39] Bible until you heard this
[1:47:43] message you would have heard about a
[1:47:45] historic God or a theological God you
[1:47:49] know that he's love and he's this and
[1:47:52] that and all all of the different things
[1:47:53] and like a
[1:47:55] great Wagon Wheel and the Hub is God and
[1:48:00] all of these spokes are all the
[1:48:02] religions of the world and you know one
[1:48:04] is Buddha and one is Muhammad and one is
[1:48:07] this and what it is is it's just
[1:48:09] religion and we're all going but the
[1:48:12] center is God Jesus said no man comes to
[1:48:16] the father but by me I am the way the
[1:48:19] truth and the life no man comes to the
[1:48:21] father amen but by me well then would
[1:48:25] you show us the father and and Jesus
[1:48:28] said have I been with you for so
[1:48:31] long that if you've seen me if you had
[1:48:34] revelation of who I am you've seen the
[1:48:36] father because I and my father are
[1:48:40] one he did not come to reveal himself he
[1:48:44] said the son can do nothing except the
[1:48:46] father reveal it to him
[1:48:49] first amen
[1:49:00] Isaiah 53:2
[1:49:03] says therefore I will divide him a
[1:49:05] portion with the great and he shall
[1:49:08] divide the spoil with the strong because
[1:49:11] he ha poured out his soul unto
[1:49:15] death he poured out his
[1:49:18] soul unto
[1:49:21] death now I began to look through the
[1:49:24] scripture and we know that Christ is
[1:49:26] also a perfect example of the Pascal
[1:49:30] lamb the lamb that was to be slain to
[1:49:34] shed its blood because without the
[1:49:36] shedding of blood there is no remission
[1:49:38] of
[1:49:40] sin as it says there in Isaiah he poured
[1:49:43] out his
[1:49:45] soul the Hebrew
[1:49:48] word Soul actually means his life
[1:49:53] same
[1:49:55] word this I don't know how you say it
[1:50:01] nefes and it comes from the same Hebrew
[1:50:04] word that is translated to
[1:50:07] life the Bible says in Leviticus
[1:50:10] 1711 for the life same Hebrew word
[1:50:14] neesh for of the flesh is in the blood
[1:50:23] so watch the prophet divide now between
[1:50:26] spirit and soul hang on with me there
[1:50:29] okay Christ revealed in his own word the
[1:50:33] five senses on the outer realm that it
[1:50:37] has five senses to the
[1:50:40] body and that's see taste smell feel
[1:50:44] here you cannot contact this body except
[1:50:47] by one or all of those senses but to
[1:50:50] contact the spirit which which is the
[1:50:53] inside of that it has five gateways also
[1:50:57] memory imaginations conscience affection
[1:51:00] and reasoning five
[1:51:03] gates and many people are touched by one
[1:51:07] of those gates to the spirit let me give
[1:51:10] you an example brother Brenham his first
[1:51:12] sermon he
[1:51:14] preached and after the service was over
[1:51:17] he had he asked his Pastor okay brother
[1:51:20] Davis how did I do
[1:51:23] he said
[1:51:25] horrible well the people cried I cried
[1:51:28] they all cried they ah they cried baby
[1:51:30] showers and all kinds of stuff he said
[1:51:34] bill you never preach the
[1:51:36] word he thought because he was emotional
[1:51:40] and he got people crying and used
[1:51:43] perhaps the channel of
[1:51:45] imagination oh your grandmother died you
[1:51:48] loved her didn't you oh you want to see
[1:51:50] your grandma in heaven I'll tell you
[1:51:52] what what you better live a good life
[1:51:54] yes Grandma I want to see grandma again
[1:51:56] using the channel of imagination or
[1:51:59] don't can you just imagine how nice
[1:52:01] heaven will be and it'll be so wonderful
[1:52:04] no sorrow no heartache yes yes and
[1:52:07] people come and they cry and it's their
[1:52:09] channel to their
[1:52:11] emotion and it never goes to the soul
[1:52:15] and he says they come up and cry big
[1:52:17] crocodile tears and he says have you
[1:52:20] ever heard a goat cry
[1:52:23] it cries like a
[1:52:25] sheep he said it takes a real Shepherd
[1:52:28] to know the
[1:52:29] difference
[1:52:31] okay so now you got memory oh memory
[1:52:37] let's let's go down memory lane and you
[1:52:40] know yes yes like some girls do when
[1:52:43] they dated a boy in high school and they
[1:52:45] hear a song in the radio in the car oh
[1:52:49] Bobby Bobby
[1:52:52] you
[1:52:56] know it ain't Bobby it's
[1:52:59] Ronnie and you're sitting in Ronnie's
[1:53:02] car if you want
[1:53:06] Bobby anyway just Sandy didn't do that
[1:53:10] thank you s no no so don't look at her
[1:53:13] she didn't do that she's not guilty of
[1:53:16] that now the inside of that man is the
[1:53:19] spirit and it has five senses and they
[1:53:22] and just like the corn in the field and
[1:53:24] the weed in the field they can be
[1:53:26] Anointed with the same holy spirit that
[1:53:28] the real believer is Anointed
[1:53:32] with but down on the inside of the next
[1:53:35] realm the Third
[1:53:36] Realm is the
[1:53:38] soul and that's the predestinated by God
[1:53:43] there is where the real seed germ lays
[1:53:46] in there brother RM said until you ask
[1:53:50] Christ to come into your
[1:53:53] heart and he sits on the throne room and
[1:53:55] your heart he actually drew a picture
[1:53:58] and in the center of the heart or the
[1:54:00] soul he says he drew a throne like a
[1:54:05] chair and a
[1:54:06] serpent and he says when that spirit of
[1:54:10] God comes in it kills the serpent first
[1:54:14] the old
[1:54:17] nature amen and now he sits on the
[1:54:20] throne of your heart
[1:54:23] and now he's in control cuz that's the
[1:54:25] control room you got it all
[1:54:29] right and he says that's where the real
[1:54:32] seed germ lays so if in Christ who was
[1:54:37] the seed Gene of God inside of his heart
[1:54:41] when it ruptured what came
[1:54:44] forth all of those seed jeans and the
[1:54:47] devil doesn't know how to handle
[1:54:50] you if he could have but you know what
[1:54:53] all of you were planted in different
[1:54:55] seasons none of you came up in Ephesus
[1:55:00] thyra you came up in laiaa you never got
[1:55:04] a choice if you would have you'd have
[1:55:06] never chose ladia it's the worst of all
[1:55:09] ages and yet it's the best of all
[1:55:12] ages

[1:55:18] there and we mingle around with those
[1:55:19] what age are you from oh Ephesus oh you

[1:55:59] blood covered
[1:56:01] the multitudes of my sins somebody say
[1:56:05] hallelujah
[1:56:09] hallelujah true Jesus poured out his
[1:56:12] soul under
[1:56:13] death watch this blasphemi his names
[1:56:17] 62 it was the Holy Spirit that birthed
[1:56:20] the saman church the holy spirit that
[1:56:23] give the pergamus church and the thy
[1:56:26] church and Dark Ages it's the holy
[1:56:28] spirit that built that bride the elect
[1:56:31] that's pulled out of all organization
[1:56:34] systems down Through the Ages like that
[1:56:37] there's an elected a predestinated bride
[1:56:40] of Jesus Christ that's the Holy Spirit

[1:57:04] Holy
[1:57:05] Spirit
[1:57:08] Hallelujah when his heart bursts like
[1:57:10] the doctors explain the stress caused
[1:57:13] the water and blood to separate within
[1:57:16] the heart and the pericardium around him
[1:57:19] Jesus was crucified in stress and agony
[1:57:23] of being scourged in the loss of blood
[1:57:26] he carried his own cross up the hill
[1:57:28] until he fell under its
[1:57:31] load and they had a black
[1:57:34] man to pick up his cross that's what
[1:57:38] brother Bram
[1:57:41] said do you know that brother Bram said
[1:57:44] that a colored man a black man is born
[1:57:47] more n he says is by nature more
[1:57:51] spiritual
[1:57:53] than a white man it's just their nature
[1:57:56] I think you know what I think I think
[1:57:58] because of a black man carrying the
[1:58:00] cross I think they got an extra special
[1:58:04] blessing that's that's just me I could
[1:58:06] be wrong but you know what you let a
[1:58:08] black group get together let them get to

[2:04:03] have to be tested and put under pressure
[2:04:05] yes sir to see really what you
[2:04:09] believe yeah it's true yeah nobody likes
[2:04:12] pressure nobody likes having to be
[2:04:14] tested
[2:04:21] three
[2:04:22] us test test test why are we always
[2:04:26] having
[2:04:27] tests nobody likes to be
[2:04:30] tested I remember my twin brother had a
[2:04:35] he had it was one of I think it was
[2:04:38] Rosal ski
[2:04:40] binding and it says engineered to go the
[2:04:44] limit I got a sermon off
[2:04:47] that you know what I tell you what a you
[2:04:51] are
[2:04:52] engineered to go to the
[2:04:58] Limit every one of you are engineered to
[2:05:02] go to the limit you may think that
[2:05:04] you're right there and you're about
[2:05:06] ready to break but you know what he said
[2:05:08] there'll never be anything on you that
[2:05:11] you cannot bear but what I will make
[2:05:14] away of Escape for you so there'll never
[2:05:18] be anything oh it's too great it's too
[2:05:20] hard I just can't
[2:05:22] oh
[2:05:24] no you just got to let go and let
[2:05:29] God
[2:05:32] engineered to go the
[2:05:35] limit all right brother Brenham said in
[2:05:38] the mighty
[2:05:39] conqueror hang on with me just for a few
[2:05:42] more minutes well we're right at
[2:05:44] 12:00 some of you are
[2:05:52] yeah be
[2:05:53] honest your Halo drops at 12:00
[2:06:00] and if there's anything that makes a
[2:06:03] Christians lazy it's when they're on a
[2:06:06] flowery bed of
[2:06:10] ease we don't have persecutions
[2:06:15] enough we don't have it hard
[2:06:19] enough that's a good quote for some of
[2:06:21] you it's too hard you don't have it hard
[2:06:25] enough always the chain is strong as it
[2:06:28] the weakest L man under pressure is what
[2:06:31] he is when he's under pressure his real
[2:06:35] true characteristic will show when he's
[2:06:38] under pressure get him all uh riled
[2:06:41] stirred up then you'll see the real man
[2:06:44] come
[2:06:45] out if he's got a temper it'll show
[2:06:49] itself if he's meak and G a little show
[2:06:52] it put them under pressure once God puts
[2:06:56] all children under test to see whether
[2:06:59] there's any flaws in
[2:07:06] them you
[2:07:08] ever didn't pass the
[2:07:11] test and you saw where failure
[2:07:15] was you do not pass go and collect $200
[2:07:19] this is not Monopoly
[2:07:21] you go through that test until you pass
[2:07:25] it and when you're put up under a test
[2:07:28] when you're fixing to be used for God
[2:07:31] for a
[2:07:33] testimony think of that when you're
[2:07:35] fixing to be used of God for a
[2:07:38] testimony like the lady here in the
[2:07:40] wheelchair the man the little boy some
[2:07:43] of the people out there maybe you
[2:07:45] Christians and wonder why you're put
[2:07:47] under the test God's fixing to use your
[2:07:50] testimony but he wants to see how you'll
[2:07:53] react so he puts the pressure on if you
[2:07:56] blow up well then he can't do nothing
[2:07:59] with you but if you'll hold on stand the
[2:08:04] test United under one head I'm I
[2:08:07] musicians who have come I'm going to
[2:08:09] bring this to a close here real
[2:08:18] quick they sit down there and blow up
[2:08:20] like a toad
[2:08:21] frog eating
[2:08:23] Buckshot I've never seen
[2:08:28] that but I have mental
[2:08:31] imagery and he can carry an all carry on
[2:08:35] awful when he knows no more about God
[2:08:37] than a hot and HT knows about an
[2:08:39] Egyptian
[2:08:43] nights you know that's the truth go down
[2:08:46] and see the glory of God and somebody
[2:08:48] get healed and say it's psychology
[2:08:51] how can you believe when you've got
[2:08:54] nothing to believe with if God's on your
[2:08:57] heart's
[2:09:00] Throne I tell you he will agree with
[2:09:02] every
[2:09:04] word you sisters that sang that
[2:09:07] song I
[2:09:10] believe that blessed me so much because
[2:09:13] you know what what do you do I just
[2:09:16] believe I can't explain it
[2:09:19] all I don't understand understand why
[2:09:22] God does certain things I
[2:09:26] don't but I
[2:09:28] believe because I was born to
[2:09:31] believe I was born for this
[2:09:41] message God says unbelievers say I doubt
[2:09:45] that God says amen the Bible said Jesus
[2:09:48] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:09:50] forever Holy Spirit says amen the church
[2:09:53] Creed will say well he's in uh so much
[2:09:56] he is uh I'm the Lord heals all thy
[2:09:59] disease as well he used to but the Holy
[2:10:03] Spirit on the heart notice he's always
[2:10:05] going back to the heart we're talking
[2:10:07] about heart
[2:10:08] issues but the Holy Spirit on the heart
[2:10:11] will say Amen to every word of God
[2:10:14] because he wrote it he is the writer he
[2:10:16] is the
[2:10:18] author the unbelieving scientific polish
[2:10:21] scholar with a DD PhD dou l d all that
[2:10:25] kind of nonsense they'll disagree with
[2:10:27] it because they don't know any different
[2:10:30] like the old colored man was down in the
[2:10:33] South he kept singing and his boss said
[2:10:35] said what's makes you so happy he
[2:10:39] said I got heartfelt
[2:10:44] religion h no such thing at heartfelt
[2:10:47] religion boss you made one mistake
[2:10:50] what's that you should
[2:10:52] have you should have said there's no
[2:10:55] such thing as heartfelt religion as far
[2:10:57] as you
[2:11:00] know CU you don't know is this apple
[2:11:04] sweet or sour I don't know I haven't
[2:11:06] bitten into it that's your
[2:11:11] problem don't ever let your heart get
[2:11:13] hardened let me just talk over one other
[2:11:16] thing here because many times we come to
[2:11:18] church our heart is hardened why certain
[2:11:21] things issues come up attitudes
[2:11:24] complexes somebody said something well
[2:11:26] he said over here oh I don't care hey
[2:11:30] we're too far along
[2:11:33] now we're too
[2:11:36] mature to have those childish
[2:11:40] issues Hebrews 3: 12-1 15 take heed
[2:11:44] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[2:11:47] evil heart of
[2:11:50] unbelief in departing from the Living
[2:11:54] God but exhort one another
[2:11:57] daily while it is called today lest any
[2:12:01] of you should be hardened through the
[2:12:04] deceitfulness of
[2:12:07] sin for we are made partakers of Christ
[2:12:11] if we hold the beginning of our
[2:12:13] confidence steadfast Until the End while
[2:12:17] it is say
[2:12:19] today if you will hear his voice Harden
[2:12:23] not your
[2:12:25] heart as in the
[2:12:28] provocation sometimes mere
[2:12:32] association with
[2:12:36] inconsistent and weak
[2:12:39] Christians have been the
[2:12:41] downfall of many younger
[2:12:44] Christians because it was a wrong
[2:12:46] influence
[2:12:54] hardening of the heart is a process it
[2:12:56] takes
[2:12:58] time doesn't happen overnight it's a
[2:13:01] process how do you get calluses on your
[2:13:05] hands any of you ever got a callus you
[2:13:08] ever worked and worked with your hands
[2:13:10] enough I remember framing houses until
[2:13:12] my hands were just I had yellow calluses
[2:13:15] all over from using a
[2:13:18] hammer how do you get it from
[2:13:21] daily
[2:13:23] rubbing
[2:13:25] against the skin and it gets
[2:13:29] calloused takes a process you don't get
[2:13:31] calluses overnight takes a
[2:13:34] while so it is a callous heart a
[2:13:37] hardened heart well he said this one
[2:13:40] said and I I won't hey I'm not going to
[2:13:42] make it right oh my quit being
[2:13:46] childish love one another with an
[2:13:49] unfaded love if they said it so what go
[2:13:54] on
[2:13:56] hey any of you have ever had somebody
[2:13:59] hurt you you're wounded somebody said
[2:14:01] something and ah maybe you got
[2:14:04] heartbroke over
[2:14:07] it Sister Sarah it was
[2:14:10] no
[2:14:12] coincidence that you
[2:14:14] volunteered and when I ask you to act
[2:14:17] like your heart broke you
[2:14:19] said I been
[2:14:22] there how many of you can say I've
[2:14:25] experienced a heartbreak at some time in
[2:14:28] my life yeah look at those hands you
[2:14:31] know what it's not nice doesn't feel
[2:14:35] good there's a lot of Tears there's a
[2:14:37] lot of ah all kinds of complexities
[2:14:41] about it but you know what I love the
[2:14:43] fact that Jesus said I'm going to preach
[2:14:45] the
[2:14:47] gospel and I'm going to heal up the
[2:14:50] broken
[2:14:56] I'm going to heal their
[2:14:58] wounds and the only way he can do it is
[2:15:01] when he sits on your
[2:15:09] throne that's why we sing those
[2:15:13] songs prepare our
[2:15:16] hearts created me a clean heart
[2:15:21] soften my my heart with
[2:15:25] oil we sing all these songs about the
[2:15:28] heart because it's the most important
[2:15:31] part of your body it's an involuntary
[2:15:34] muscle you don't tell it to move you
[2:15:36] don't tell it that when you lay down and
[2:15:39] you sit up you don't tell it to increase
[2:15:41] its heartbeat it automatically does
[2:15:46] it and let me say that you're just a
[2:15:48] Heartbeat Away
[2:15:54] from God right
[2:15:57] now because if something
[2:16:07] happen I I asked Sandy the other day I
[2:16:11] said Sandy come over here give me a
[2:16:13] hug yeah any of you ever just need a hug
[2:16:16] once a while like Sarah you said can I
[2:16:18] give you a hug
[2:16:22] and I had Sandy I said Sandy I just need
[2:16:24] a hug come over here I needed a hug I
[2:16:27] put my head on her chest and my ear was
[2:16:31] right there above her heart and it
[2:16:38] was I I thought oh
[2:16:41] God blessed is her
[2:16:44] heart because it follows God and it
[2:16:48] loves
[2:16:49] God and it blessed me it told me I said
[2:16:53] I Sandy I heard your heartbeat I
[2:16:56] said it was so good knowing that that
[2:17:00] heart is true and it beats for
[2:17:11] God Ephesians 4 and then I'm going to go
[2:17:14] to one more scripture and I'm going to
[2:17:15] close I'm not going to go into the rest
[2:17:18] Ephesians 4
[2:17:23] this I say therefore in testifying the
[2:17:25] Lord that we henceforth walk not as
[2:17:27] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[2:17:29] their mind having the understanding
[2:17:32] darkened being alienated from the life
[2:17:35] of God through the ignorance that is in
[2:17:38] them because of the
[2:17:41] blindness of their
[2:17:44] heart that's a heart issue isn't it a
[2:17:48] blindness of their heart
[2:17:52] who being past feeling have given
[2:17:55] themselves over unto
[2:17:58] lasciviousness
[2:18:00] foolishness do things that are not
[2:18:02] pleasing to God because of the blindness
[2:18:05] of their
[2:18:07] heart Jeremiah 17:9 and 10 the heart is
[2:18:13] deceitful above all
[2:18:16] things and desperately wicked who can
[2:18:20] know
[2:18:21] it oh I
[2:18:24] just I just want to do my own thing do
[2:18:27] what's on my heart yeah the heart
[2:18:30] is desperately wicked who can know
[2:18:37] it I the Lord search the
[2:18:41] heart and I try the Reigns even to give
[2:18:44] every man according to his ways and
[2:18:45] according to the fruit of his doings
[2:18:52] you know I'm going to I'm going to do
