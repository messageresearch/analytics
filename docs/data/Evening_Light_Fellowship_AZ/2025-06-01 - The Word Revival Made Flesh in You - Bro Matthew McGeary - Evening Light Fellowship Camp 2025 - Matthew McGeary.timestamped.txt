[7:40] am I will
[7:43] sing of the
[7:46] goodness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[7:49] the
[7:50] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[7:55] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank the Lord
[7:57] for his mercy, his goodness, and his
[7:59] grace. You may be seated.
[8:02] God is so good. We appreciate every one
[8:05] of you that are here. And we certainly
[8:07] appreciate your worship. So, let's
[8:09] continue this worship on tonight and
[8:12] pull upon the gift of God. And we
[8:14] realize that if we'll pull, God will
[8:16] speak. Amen. Amen. We have a few
[8:18] announcements just before we get started
[8:21] here. Uh first announcement that I would
[8:25] like to make is that a reminder of an
[8:28] offering tomorrow that will be uh taken
[8:32] up for the ministry. So if you've been
[8:33] blessed by the ministry over the weekend
[8:35] here, uh we'll have a box up front and
[8:38] uh God loves a cheerful giver. Amen. Uh
[8:42] also we'll have baptisms right after
[8:45] service tomorrow. And uh if you have it
[8:48] on your heart, you'd like to be
[8:49] baptized, surrender your life to Christ,
[8:52] there's no better place to do it than at
[8:54] camp. And uh we've already had quite a
[8:56] few that are uh have said they want to
[8:59] do that and they want to make that
[9:00] consecration to God. So, praise the
[9:03] Lord. And um we're certainly thankful
[9:05] for that because that's what it's all
[9:07] about. Amen.
[9:10] Um, also has anybody in here lost
[9:12] anything like jackets, cell phones,
[9:16] different things? If you have, there's a
[9:19] lost and found in the cafeteria uh by
[9:22] the fireplace there and we're just as we
[9:25] find things, we're just setting it over
[9:27] there. So, if you have lost a jacket or
[9:29] a phone or misplaced something, um, go
[9:32] there and check it out cuz that's where
[9:34] it'll be. Amen. Have we got these notes
[9:37] yet, guys, or? No, nothing. Oh, praise
[9:41] the Lord. We'll not take up too much
[9:43] more time. We have church tomorrow.
[9:45] Tomorrow morning, be here before 9:00.
[9:48] Make sure you come to breakfast. I guess
[9:50] that would be some good advice. How
[9:52] about tonight? It would be it would be
[9:54] very good if you just pack up your
[9:56] clothes and everything tonight. That
[9:58] way, you're not in a rush to do it in
[10:00] the morning when you uh when we're
[10:02] trying to get ready and get packed up
[10:03] for for service. There we go. Yeah, look
[10:07] at that. Pack up before breakfast. We
[10:09] were on the same channel. No sports
[10:12] today, which means tomorrow. Okay. Uh we
[10:15] don't do sports here on Sundays.
[10:16] Breakfast 8:00, 8:40. Service at 9:00.
[10:20] Lunch at 12. Kemp closing awards 12:45.
[10:24] And we trust that Team 2 Green will win
[10:26] that. And uh departure time is around
[10:29] 2:30 p.m. So the baptisms will be in
[10:32] there also. and just pack up tonight,
[10:34] get ready, come tomorrow uh uh to
[10:37] breakfast, you know, already dressed in
[10:39] your clothes so that way you're not
[10:40] running back and forth and trying to uh
[10:43] you know, time is precious. Okay, so
[10:46] praise the Lord. We are excited tonight
[10:48] for the word and brother Greg is going
[10:50] to lead us in song. So, Brother Greg
[10:52] could come and uh lead us in worship.
[10:55] How about we all just stand to our feet?
[10:58] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Are you
[11:00] happy tonight? How about we give the
[11:02] Lord one more clap?
[11:08] [Applause]
[11:10] Amen. If we could sing Heart of
[11:14] Worship. Amen.
[11:17] Oh, when the music
[11:21] fades and all is stripped
[11:24] away and I simply

[11:35] bring something that's a word that'll
[11:39] bless your heart.
[11:45] I'll bring you more than a
[11:48] song. For a song in itself is not what
[11:53] you have
[11:57] required. You search much deeper
[12:02] within through the way things appear.
[12:05] You're looking into my
[12:08] heart. I'm coming back to you. I'm
[12:13] coming back to the heart of worship.

[12:51] world. Oh, no one could
[12:54] express how much you
[12:59] deserve my mind. Oh, I'm weak and poor.
[13:05] Lord, all I have is yours.
[13:09] every single
[13:11] breath. Let's worship
[13:14] him. I'll bring you more than a
[13:18] song for
[13:21] song is not what you have
[13:27] required. You search much deeper
[13:31] within through the way things appear.
[13:35] You're looking into my heart.
[13:41] And I'm coming back to the heart of
[13:47] worship. And it's all about
[13:50] you. Yes, it's all about you,
[13:55] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[14:00] made it. When it's all about
[14:04] you. Yes, it's all about you.
[14:09] I'm coming back to the
[14:13] heart,
[14:17] brother. Oh yes, it's all about you,
[14:22] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[14:27] made it. When it's all about
[14:31] you. Yes, it's all about you, Jesus.

[14:52] everyone. Uh my name is Elias and um
[14:55] about a couple weeks ago I had a rolled
[14:58] ankle and it was pretty bad and just
[15:02] throughout the weeks it's gotten better
[15:03] and better and just about 2 hours ago I
[15:07] was playing basketball and I jumped and
[15:09] I landed on somebody's ankle again and
[15:11] felt like the same thing. It hurt really
[15:14] bad and Matias was just like let's just
[15:16] pray and he prayed and all the pain went
[15:19] away. I felt a I felt a hand
[15:28] as it as he was praying, I just felt a
[15:30] hand on my shoulder and I knew it was
[15:32] going to be okay. So, I'm just so

[15:52] ministering, Father, we're just so

[16:49] soul. For I knew my Lord had
[16:54] control. And I knew I was walking in
[16:58] life.
[17:00] before I've been on my knees in the
[17:08] [Applause]

[25:05] assurance everything's going to be all
[25:08] right.
[25:09] Lord, I see another
[25:13] battle out in front of
[25:16] me. I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll
[25:21] go down in defeat. And he said, "Do you
[25:28] remember where I brought you
[25:32] from? Just take a look behind you and
[25:37] see how far you've come.
[25:40] Oh, when every time you asked me, didn't

[26:41] Now she's talking to her
[26:44] father in a house that was once a
[26:48] home. She said, "My bills are coming to
[26:52] Lord. Six days is not that
[26:56] long." She hears a voice so soft and
[27:00] Lord says, "I move like that
[27:04] before. I'll do this little thing.
[27:15] Oh my
[27:35] god. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[27:47] Just die
[27:51] for search until I found you. I do it

[47:59] Amen. Amen. As we prepare to turn the
[48:02] service over to our brother Matt, if we
[48:04] could sing that song. Pour your spirit
[48:06] out on
[48:07] me. Pour your spirit out on
[48:12] me. Fall just like the
[48:17] rain.
[48:20] Saturate my thirsty
[48:23] soul. Come and fall fresh on me.
[48:29] Fill my cup
[48:31] [Applause]
[48:33] again. Heal my
[48:36] heart and make
[48:41] me. Oh, I need you
[48:45] now. Pour your
[48:48] spirit out. Let's sing that
[48:53] verse. Lord, I seek you.
[48:57] Please help me find
[49:01] you. How I need your
[49:08] touch. Find my
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:12] dry broken
[49:16] places thirsty for your love.
[49:24] And Lord forgive
[49:27] me if I
[49:31] want far away from you.
[49:36] [Music]
[49:53] Pour your spirit out on me. Lord, would
[49:58] you fall just like the
[50:01] rain and
[50:04] saturate my
[50:08] thirsty and fall fresh on
[50:12] me? Fill my cup again.
[50:20] and make me
[50:25] home. I need you
[50:28] now. Pour your
[50:31] spirit. Let's just say that again. Pour
[50:34] your spirit on me. Pour your spit out on
[50:38] me.
[50:40] All
[50:44] just
[50:46] saturate my
[50:51] thirsty fresh.
[51:08] I need you
[51:11] now. Pour your
[51:13] spirit
[51:16] out. Amen. As they continue to play
[51:19] that, man, that song was on my heart
[51:23] and I believe we've been digging
[51:27] ditches. We've been making
[51:31] ready. And I I so appreciated the
[51:33] message this morning. I I feel like
[51:36] brother Andrew could have I mean,
[51:38] Brother Steven could have just
[51:42] uh could have just had a call right
[51:45] then. Flee to Calvary. Run to Christ.
[51:50] The veil has been
[51:51] rent. And I'm just in a great
[51:55] expectation this evening for what God
[51:58] has for
[52:00] you. God has come here to do something
[52:02] special for you. and we've had a lot of
[52:05] fun and activities and now we've come in
[52:08] and we've created the
[52:10] atmosphere. Why don't we just approach
[52:13] him? Lord
[52:15] Jesus, how we love
[52:18] you. Lord, we've enjoyed the song
[52:22] service
[52:23] and the song specials were such a
[52:26] blessing and ministering to our hearts
[52:28] and our soul.
[52:31] Lord, we pray that we've also ministered
[52:33] to
[52:34] you by telling you that we love you and
[52:37] need you.
[52:38] And Lord, as we sing this song, Pour
[52:41] Your Spirit
[52:43] Out, Lord, we we want an a
[52:47] personal touch.
[52:50] Lord, something that's so personal that
[52:54] it would make a change.
[52:58] Lord, there'd be such a a reality
[53:02] that nothing could ever take it
[53:05] away. Many times, Lord, we hear good
[53:08] sermons and go to good
[53:11] meetings, it comes and goes and it seems
[53:14] like it doesn't have maybe an effect
[53:16] because our nature stays the same and
[53:18] our challenges stay the same and we
[53:20] don't have the victory.
[53:22] Lord, I believe that this is a
[53:24] predestinated moment in time that you
[53:26] looked down through the portals of time
[53:28] before you even formed one speck of dust
[53:31] and you said, "I'm going to meet this
[53:32] predestinated seed and I'm going to fill
[53:34] this predestinated seed and I'm going to
[53:37] pour my spirit out onto them in such a
[53:39] way that'll bring such a reality that
[53:41] they'll be changed forever." Lord,
[53:44] that's my heart's desire. Lord, we just
[53:47] commit the service to you in the
[53:48] preaching of the word. ask that you'd
[53:49] come break the bread of life as only you
[53:52] can in Jesus Christ's name I ask it.
[53:55] Amen. We just my what a wonderful
[53:58] atmosphere
[54:01] here. Hard to break it sometime but
[54:03] we're here for the word. Let's just move
[54:05] into our Bibles into Romans chapter
[54:10] 7.
[54:12] Um I just want to say it's
[54:16] uh been such a privilege. This will be
[54:18] my last time uh speaking to you during
[54:21] these meetings and I just want to thank
[54:22] brother Ron uh for the invitation and e
[54:25] evening fellowship. Y'all have done an
[54:28] amazing job. I believe that might
[54:31] deserve a a hand clap. Why don't you
[54:33] just give a hand clap for an amazing
[54:35] camp all the counselors, all the work,
[54:39] uh just all the organization of getting
[54:41] people to where they need to go. Uh it's
[54:43] just been tremendous and it's been an
[54:45] honor to serve with brother Steven. just
[54:46] looking forward uh to the the the word
[54:49] tomorrow. But uh my our hearts are just
[54:52] overflowing with what God's done. But
[54:54] he's not finished.
[54:56] So we just without further ado, we'll
[54:59] just move right into the word. Romans 7
[55:01] and verse
[55:03] 14. Are y'all looking forward to the
[55:05] Lord to do something? Romans
[55:08] 7, we'll read 14-2.
[55:12] For we know that the law is spiritual,
[55:14] but I am carnal, sold under sin. For
[55:18] that which I do, I allow not. For what I
[55:21] would, that I that do I not, but what I
[55:24] hate, that do I. If then I do, that
[55:27] which I would not, I consent under the
[55:29] law that is good. Now then it is no more
[55:32] I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
[55:35] me. We'll just ask a blessing upon the
[55:37] reading of the word and you can be
[55:38] seated cuz I I just want to continue
[55:40] reading that for a moment and start over
[55:42] because um I just love how Paul uh
[55:46] writes this because sometimes I just
[55:48] feel like he wrote it in a way that make
[55:49] the way you feel.
[55:53] I mean listen to this now. He says for
[55:56] that which I do I allow not. For what I
[55:58] would that do I not but what I hate that
[56:02] do I. If then I do that which I would
[56:05] not, I consent under the law that is
[56:06] good. Now then is it no more I that do
[56:09] it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I
[56:11] know that in me, that is my flesh
[56:13] dwelleth no good thing. To will is
[56:15] present with me, but how to perform that
[56:18] which is good I find not. For the good
[56:20] that I would, I do not, but the evil
[56:24] which I would not that I do. I don't
[56:27] know about you, but that's kind of
[56:31] confusing. And I and I I think that kind
[56:34] of is exactly how we feel sometime
[56:36] because we want to do good and then the
[56:38] good we want to do we we're not finding
[56:40] the ability to do it and then we we know
[56:42] there's been a change. We know
[56:43] something's taking place in our life but
[56:45] then there's this mistakes and these
[56:47] things we make and you're like well wait
[56:48] a second I I thought I was doing good
[56:50] but now I'm doing bad and and the good I
[56:52] would I I'm not doing and the the thing
[56:54] I hate I'm doing. What what am I doing
[56:57] anyways? Anybody ever feel like that?
[57:01] All right. So we'll just keep reading
[57:02] what Paul is saying
[57:04] here. Verse 19 again. For the good that
[57:07] I would, I do not, but the evil which I
[57:09] would not that I do. Now if I do that I
[57:12] would not, it is no more I that do it,
[57:14] but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then
[57:16] a law that when I would do
[57:20] good, evil is present with me. For I
[57:24] delight in the law of God after the
[57:26] inward man. But I see another law in my
[57:31] members, waring against the law of my
[57:34] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[57:36] the law of sin which is in my members.
[57:38] Oh a wretched man that I am, who shall
[57:42] deliver me from the body of this death?
[57:45] I thank God through Jesus Christ our
[57:48] Lord. So then with the mind I myself
[57:50] serve the law of God, but with the flesh
[57:53] the law of sin. Brother Brandon would
[57:56] say this in broken sisters. He'd say,
[57:58] "It takes the spirit of God to bring
[58:00] life." And that life must not come out
[58:04] of just an intellectual revival. It gots
[58:07] to come out of the Bible. Word revival.
[58:10] And that word is the same yesterday,
[58:12] today, and forever. And when it falls
[58:14] today and quickens, you get the same
[58:17] results you did in Acts two. Exactly. It
[58:20] always has and it always will be because
[58:22] the spirit of God that conditions the
[58:25] atmosphere. And and by the help of the
[58:27] Lord, I I just I I was just looking at a
[58:30] title and how we might uh word this. And
[58:33] I I went back this way and and that way,
[58:35] but just to maybe lay something out
[58:37] there, I just want to preach to you for
[58:39] a title. The word revival made flesh in
[58:41] you. So the bride's revival is a word
[58:44] revival. All right. It's because the
[58:47] opening of the word and the third pool
[58:49] as in questions and answers. Somebody
[58:50] was asking about the shift in brother
[58:52] Brandham's uh ministry. We understand
[58:54] that there was the first pool uh
[58:56] healing. Second pool discerning of the
[58:58] thoughts and intents of the heart. But
[58:59] then that third pull was the opening of
[59:01] the word which was revealing revealing
[59:04] Christ. I it it not only did the message
[59:06] of the hour reveal the son of predition
[59:08] and and Satan and all of his evil works,
[59:10] but it was revealing Christ, revealing
[59:11] Christ that we could come into a union
[59:13] with him. And and so what I in my title,
[59:15] what I'm trying to get to you that this
[59:17] word revival, this message that we have
[59:20] heard, it it's becoming flesh in you. I
[59:24] it's not something that you just hear
[59:26] and and something that's on on the books
[59:28] and and something that's on the tapes as
[59:30] we would say or in some digital format.
[59:32] But as you hear the word, you become the
[59:35] word.
[59:38] The word revival made flesh in you. And
[59:40] in a paradox, brother Brandham would
[59:43] say, now what is it? C Christ coming to
[59:46] the body. Christ is the word. We all
[59:50] know the anointing is Christ that comes
[59:53] on the word that makes the word live.
[59:55] Now, you are the word. I want to tell
[59:58] you, each one of you are the word. the
[1:00:00] mechanics of the word that was sown out
[1:00:02] in time. A predestinated seed word of
[1:00:05] God that God placed here that you and
[1:00:08] you showed up not even maybe knowing it
[1:00:11] or maybe you've had an intellectual
[1:00:13] conception of who you are because you
[1:00:15] were raised in the message just like
[1:00:17] Moses the prophet of God would talk
[1:00:19] about how Moses and why Christ speak. He
[1:00:21] had a an intellectual faith but see his
[1:00:24] intellectual faith could not bring the
[1:00:26] results of what he was predestinated to
[1:00:28] do. He had to come to a place where his
[1:00:30] intellectual faith became quickened.
[1:00:33] Because if you study the story of Moses,
[1:00:35] Moses, he knew that he was born a proper
[1:00:37] child. Moses was a believer. He he he
[1:00:40] believed the message. He was told by his
[1:00:42] mom and he was raised and he realized,
[1:00:43] you know what? I I don't belong in
[1:00:45] Pharaoh's palace. I belong out there
[1:00:47] with my people. And he realized he was
[1:00:50] born to be a deliverer. And what did he
[1:00:51] try to do? He tried to deliver the
[1:00:52] people with his own strength. Well, you
[1:00:54] know what happens when you try to work
[1:00:56] up something and you try to create
[1:00:58] something with your own mistake? You
[1:00:59] fail.
[1:01:01] You might fail good for a while, but
[1:01:02] you'll find out it has no lasting
[1:01:04] result. You'll come back into the trial
[1:01:07] or you'll come back into something you
[1:01:08] realize, look, I ain't really got what I
[1:01:09] thought I
[1:01:11] had. But Moses had to come to a place
[1:01:13] where he met uh h the logos on the back
[1:01:16] side of the desert and he was quickened.
[1:01:20] You following me?
[1:01:23] All right. And so each one of you, you
[1:01:25] have to come to a place where sure we
[1:01:27] could just go so many directions, but
[1:01:29] you have to first receive the word into
[1:01:31] your mind. You know, the womb of your
[1:01:32] mind and or it's the womb of your
[1:01:34] spirit. You get into that teaching
[1:01:35] first. You got to hear the word, but
[1:01:37] then something has to happen where it's
[1:01:38] quickened and it drops down into your
[1:01:40] soul.
[1:01:42] All right.
[1:01:44] So he says it got to he says uh here
[1:01:47] just moving on. He says that that makes
[1:01:49] the word live. Is that right? That is
[1:01:51] the anointing. Christ is the anointing,
[1:01:53] the spirit that comes upon the word that
[1:01:56] quickens the word to make it live. Now,
[1:01:59] the word is in your heart. And he goes
[1:02:02] on and makes an example of divine
[1:02:04] healing. So, something that you're
[1:02:05] believing in or something that you've
[1:02:07] heard, you see something laying in the
[1:02:08] word, but then now Christ is going to
[1:02:10] come upon that word and bring the
[1:02:12] reality of it into manifestation. Look,
[1:02:16] if you if you are a believer and you're
[1:02:18] believing for healing or you're
[1:02:19] believing for the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:21] Ghost, then when you've done all to
[1:02:22] stand, continue
[1:02:25] standing. Satan will try to create
[1:02:27] questions. He'll try to make you wonder.
[1:02:30] And my, as you go through your Christian
[1:02:31] life, I I can't tell you, there's times
[1:02:33] where I know that I've been baptized and
[1:02:35] filled with the Holy Ghost. God, God
[1:02:37] changed me in December 99, and I've
[1:02:39] never been the same. But did I make some
[1:02:41] mistakes and some failures that really
[1:02:43] caused me to wonder? Do I really got
[1:02:45] what I got? And you know what I had to
[1:02:47] say? Well, you know what? What am I
[1:02:49] going to do? Am I going to am I going to
[1:02:52] quit? I can't quit. There's something in
[1:02:56] there that's keeping me. What am I am I
[1:02:58] going to go back to the world? Am I
[1:03:00] going to create a one-man religion
[1:03:02] where, okay, I'll just I'll have my
[1:03:03] music and and I'll have my
[1:03:05] entertainment. No, I can't. There's a
[1:03:06] hunger. There's a thirst. There's
[1:03:08] something inside of me that's craving
[1:03:09] perfection. There's something inside of
[1:03:11] me that's craving a body change. There's
[1:03:14] something in me that wants to be like
[1:03:15] that sheath wave. I seen an example in
[1:03:18] this day that was waved before the
[1:03:20] people of what the opening of the word
[1:03:21] would produce in an individual's life.
[1:03:24] And something in me wants to be that.
[1:03:28] And when I fall and I make a
[1:03:31] mistake, do I just, well, I guess I
[1:03:35] don't have what I had, so I might as
[1:03:37] well be a
[1:03:38] sinner. I might as well just keep
[1:03:40] indulging the thing I fell to. No.
[1:03:42] Something inside of you ought to start
[1:03:44] hating that thing.
[1:03:48] You know, sometimes you got to get mad
[1:03:50] at the devil.
[1:03:57] And sometimes the problem is is you like
[1:03:59] that
[1:04:02] thing. You like your music. You like
[1:04:06] your
[1:04:07] Snapchat. You like your Tik Tok. It's
[1:04:10] your safe place. It's it's what your
[1:04:12] your flesh feeds on. But there has to
[1:04:15] come a time where you as a son of God
[1:04:17] realize, you know what? I'm tired of
[1:04:19] that thing. And I want God, I want you
[1:04:22] to root it out of my
[1:04:24] life. And and I promise you, if you come
[1:04:28] to the Lord with that sincere desire in
[1:04:30] your heart, Lord, I'm willing to lay it
[1:04:32] all down. I don't care if I lose
[1:04:34] friends. I don't care if I lose family.
[1:04:36] I don't care if I'm an outcast. I don't
[1:04:38] care if I have to stand alone. The only
[1:04:40] thing I want, Lord, is you. I want you.
[1:04:43] I want the Holy Ghost. I want a
[1:04:45] revelation of the message of the hour. I
[1:04:47] want to be what you want me to be.
[1:04:53] So you stand
[1:04:55] there and the spirit comes upon that
[1:04:58] word and it quickens the word. It makes
[1:05:01] it
[1:05:03] live. And we have been ministering about
[1:05:06] that first nature having to
[1:05:08] die that you can be married to Christ.
[1:05:10] And we read Romans 7, how Paul is
[1:05:13] showing the natural law of marriage and
[1:05:15] how a woman under the law, she's subject
[1:05:17] to her husband as long as her husband
[1:05:20] lives. And I love how brother Brandham
[1:05:23] in Invisible Union, he would take that
[1:05:25] and he'd show and he would say, "I
[1:05:26] believe this is a prophecy concerning
[1:05:28] the church, how we can no longer be
[1:05:31] legal and lawful about
[1:05:33] it." I don't know if that speaks to your
[1:05:35] heart, but that speaks to me. And what
[1:05:37] it does is it lets me know that some of
[1:05:39] these things uh the this that Paul's
[1:05:41] talking about this thing that wars with
[1:05:43] me that evil is present with me and the
[1:05:46] good that I would do I do not and then
[1:05:48] and then I find out I'm doing the thing
[1:05:50] that I hate to
[1:05:51] do. But look that that Paul is not
[1:05:54] making an excuse and saying that's just
[1:05:56] the way it is. He's identifying there is
[1:06:00] there is a law uh in your members that
[1:06:03] if you don't die daily
[1:06:08] If you don't know how to do spiritual
[1:06:10] warfare, you know, it it amazes me
[1:06:12] sometimes. I mean, I I mean, some people
[1:06:15] they'll want to go they'll want to uh uh
[1:06:17] uh come for counseling or or or they'll
[1:06:19] they'll they'll want to come for advice
[1:06:21] and oh my I'm sure uh Brother Ron's
[1:06:23] going to be sitting back there going,
[1:06:24] "Oh my goodness." You know, they come
[1:06:25] and say all this and you come back to
[1:06:27] the basics. Well, are how's your how's
[1:06:29] your devotions and your prayer life? you
[1:06:32] know, how's your uh are are are y'all is
[1:06:35] your family are you praying together or
[1:06:37] uh you know, are you feeding on the
[1:06:38] message of the hour? And all of a
[1:06:41] sudden, it's like, are are you kidding
[1:06:43] me?
[1:06:44] Like you've abandoned the very
[1:06:46] fundamentals of your faith and you're
[1:06:48] having problems and you're coming to me
[1:06:50] and asking me why.
[1:06:54] That happen. Is that right, brother? It
[1:06:56] happens all the time. People get into
[1:06:58] sit. I want to I want to promise you if
[1:07:01] you quit feeding the inward man and
[1:07:04] start feeding the flesh. Oh, don't do
[1:07:07] it. Don't have any confidence in that
[1:07:10] flesh. You got to hate that thing. I
[1:07:12] tell you what, it's a good time when you
[1:07:14] wake up in the mirror. I have to do it
[1:07:16] all the time. I look in the mirror, I'm
[1:07:18] like, you know what? I don't like you.
[1:07:21] I'm sorry. And some people are agreeing
[1:07:23] like I really don't like that guy
[1:07:25] either. I am my worst enemy. And some of
[1:07:29] us have to start understanding that you
[1:07:32] are your worst enemy. Brother Brandham
[1:07:35] told us over and over, you know, the
[1:07:37] worst enemy I got is brother Brandham.
[1:07:39] If I can just get brother Brandham out
[1:07:41] of the way, then Christ can have the
[1:07:43] right away. I say each one of us
[1:07:44] tonight, oh God, let me get out of the
[1:07:47] way. Pour your spirit out on me. Let me
[1:07:49] be the son and daughter of God you've
[1:07:51] called me to be.
[1:07:56] See, because when you're when you're
[1:07:58] catering to the flesh, if you sow to the
[1:08:02] flesh, what are you going to reap?
[1:08:05] The flesh. And if you sow to the spirit,
[1:08:09] what are you going to reap?
[1:08:11] And you act like it's a complicated
[1:08:14] formula. I mean, God knew I needed a
[1:08:17] message of simplicity.
[1:08:20] I needed a simple gospel.
[1:08:23] I I'm so glad I don't have to figure out
[1:08:26] intellectually and become a theologian
[1:08:28] to be able to explain the message
[1:08:31] because many men have tried to do it and
[1:08:33] they've gotten out on a limb and they've
[1:08:34] crashed and burned.
[1:08:37] That's why it's really important just to
[1:08:38] teach what the prophet taught and say
[1:08:40] what a prophet said.
[1:08:43] Somebody asks you a question and you
[1:08:44] don't know the answer, say you don't
[1:08:46] know. Now, I'm speaking more of the
[1:08:48] pressure of a minister. Sometimes, you
[1:08:50] know, you feel like you, you know, you
[1:08:52] you do. I don't know about you, but you
[1:08:53] you want to know. Feels good to know,
[1:08:57] but don't let your flesh and your pride
[1:08:58] get in the way. And you'll say something
[1:08:59] the prophet didn't say,
[1:09:02] and you just realize, you know what? I I
[1:09:04] don't know the answer to that. And I and
[1:09:07] I'm the kind of guy and maybe I'd be
[1:09:09] labeled a simpleton or something like
[1:09:10] that. And if we got around to maybe
[1:09:12] discussing something and a questions
[1:09:14] asked, I just I don't know. Let me see
[1:09:16] what the prophet said. Like, you don't
[1:09:17] know that? Well, I'm just going to say
[1:09:19] way he said it. If you got a problem
[1:09:20] with it, take it up with him.
[1:09:24] Right.
[1:09:26] So, we're we're speaking about this
[1:09:28] nature having to
[1:09:30] die. So, Brother Brandon would say this
[1:09:33] now as we're Oh. Oh, we're going to run
[1:09:35] out of time, but you know, this was our
[1:09:36] last evening service. I I I I've uh man,
[1:09:40] I've had to cut each message. I've
[1:09:41] preached about halfway in the middle and
[1:09:43] and I've been wondering, but you know,
[1:09:44] God's had his way. But maybe we can just
[1:09:46] have a a little extra time tonight.
[1:09:48] Would that be all right?
[1:09:50] Hey, we ain't got nowhere else to go.
[1:09:52] And maybe we'll just have a good time.
[1:09:53] So, we'll try to move quickly. You amen
[1:09:55] quickly. We'll move quickly. And maybe
[1:09:56] we'll move so fast we'll just rapture
[1:09:58] right out of here. Hallelujah. Glory. I
[1:10:02] like that. So, Brother Brandham is
[1:10:05] showing this in in invisible union. He
[1:10:07] says, "Your first husband that had the
[1:10:09] rule over you was your nature by birth."
[1:10:13] Which was was nature by natural birth.
[1:10:15] Now, uh everybody remember the service
[1:10:18] last night? good. You're going to save
[1:10:20] me a whole lot of time. So, I'll just
[1:10:22] keep moving and not lay for a
[1:10:24] foundation. I'm looking for somebody
[1:10:26] that was was trying to get into the
[1:10:27] meetings and I was hoping that they they
[1:10:29] made it here. So, uh they were making a
[1:10:31] great effort to come and and by God's
[1:10:33] grace they made it. I was looking for
[1:10:34] them and uh they were they they were my
[1:10:37] I tell you what sometimes it makes you
[1:10:39] know it's so hard for us just to get 10
[1:10:42] 30 minutes down the road and this
[1:10:43] brother he went and caught a plane and
[1:10:46] he flew halfway across the United States
[1:10:49] and jumped in a car and by the by the
[1:10:51] grace of God he's making it. So
[1:10:53] nonetheless we're moving right along.
[1:10:54] Your first husband that had the rule
[1:10:56] over you was your nature by natural
[1:10:58] birth natural. You love the world
[1:11:00] because you are the world and a part of
[1:11:03] the world. That right? Well, that makes
[1:11:04] me feel a lot better. You know, you
[1:11:07] wonder why you like to do certain things
[1:11:08] and certain things grab you. Well, it's
[1:11:10] your flesh. Your desires was by nature
[1:11:12] to love the world, which you are a part
[1:11:15] of. It's all making sense. You're a part
[1:11:18] of nature. You believe that? And that's
[1:11:20] your natural thing. That's the reason
[1:11:23] you have to be born again. You have to
[1:11:25] separate. You have to die to that first
[1:11:28] husband. You can't live with it. You
[1:11:30] can't just say, "Well, I'll divorce him
[1:11:31] and hang hang him up here till
[1:11:33] occasion." That's a lot of times what we
[1:11:35] do is we come and we have an experience.
[1:11:37] We get cleaned up. We feel good. But you
[1:11:39] don't realize you're just kind of a
[1:11:41] separating for a while. That's a lot of
[1:11:43] times what people do in in in in
[1:11:45] marriages or in relationships. You know,
[1:11:47] they're going through a struggle. So,
[1:11:48] what they what do they do? They separate
[1:11:50] for a while. And and most of the time
[1:11:52] when they get back together, it's just a
[1:11:54] matter of time until they have the
[1:11:55] problem again.
[1:11:58] Right. But what what what by by God's
[1:12:00] grace needs to happen is whatever the
[1:12:01] root cause needs to be dealt with so
[1:12:03] they don't have to separate anymore. But
[1:12:05] when you're trying to separate for good,
[1:12:06] don't just hang that guy up till
[1:12:08] occasion. Well, I feel pretty good. I
[1:12:10] got cleaned up and that that sin nature,
[1:12:13] you just kind of hang it up till
[1:12:15] occasion. No, you got to come to a place
[1:12:17] where that thing dies. Where you kill
[1:12:19] that thing where where you become a new
[1:12:21] creature in Jesus Christ and old things
[1:12:23] pass away. But yet don't understand what
[1:12:25] we're laying in there in the word. Even
[1:12:27] when you come to that place, that old
[1:12:29] nature will try to follow after you and
[1:12:32] try to anoint this flesh to cause you to
[1:12:34] make decisions you shouldn't make.
[1:12:37] All right, you you following me?
[1:12:41] He says, "No, sir. No writing of
[1:12:43] divorcement." He dies. The nature of the
[1:12:46] world has to die. Every speck of them
[1:12:48] has to die. You have to be reunited
[1:12:51] again with another nature.
[1:12:54] Oh, that makes me feel like shouting.
[1:12:57] Are you hearing the way he said it? You
[1:12:59] are reunited again with another nature.
[1:13:02] That means you had a nature before you
[1:13:04] got the f the one you were born with.
[1:13:07] Hey, that sounds like shouting time to
[1:13:09] me. That means you were somewhere. Job,
[1:13:11] where were you when I laid the
[1:13:12] foundations of the world? Where were you
[1:13:14] when the sons of God shouted for joy?
[1:13:17] Look. Hey, I just showed up in Lady
[1:13:19] Osia, but I came from the mind of
[1:13:22] God. I actually had another nature. He
[1:13:25] looked at me and saw a perfect image of
[1:13:27] who I was.
[1:13:29] I was already in him in the logos.
[1:13:33] I already had a nature in
[1:13:39] Christ. You have to be
[1:13:42] reunited again with another nature. What
[1:13:45] is that other nature? Remember what Paul
[1:13:47] was saying? You got to be married to
[1:13:49] another. That was my title last night.
[1:13:51] Who is the other one you have to be
[1:13:52] married to?
[1:13:56] Like act like we're playing a act like
[1:13:58] we're playing a trivia game and you're
[1:14:01] going to win money. Who is the other we
[1:14:03] got to be married to?
[1:14:05] Yes,
[1:14:06] Christ. And what is the message?
[1:14:10] Christ. We are getting
[1:14:13] somewhere. What is the new birth? The
[1:14:16] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:14:19] you. Christ is the word. In the
[1:14:23] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:14:25] made
[1:14:27] flesh and now the word is being made
[1:14:30] flesh in
[1:14:32] you. You are written epistles read of
[1:14:35] all men. So that it it's more than just
[1:14:39] a church sermon. It's more than just a
[1:14:41] code of ethics. It's more than just just
[1:14:44] rules and regulations and something uh
[1:14:46] uh that you're trying to hear to. But
[1:14:48] it's actually a life that's springing up
[1:14:51] within you of everlasting joy and
[1:14:54] everlasting life. And you're feeding on
[1:14:56] the body word of the son of man. And you
[1:14:58] are becoming the word. And the word is
[1:15:00] becoming you. But then you have this
[1:15:02] other law waring in your members that's
[1:15:04] trying to pull you out of heavenly
[1:15:06] places. Look, right now you are seated
[1:15:09] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. But
[1:15:12] you are doing spiritual warfare. And the
[1:15:14] devil is waring after the members of
[1:15:16] your flesh, trying to use conscience and
[1:15:18] memory and doubt and affections and all
[1:15:20] the things of your past to try to tell
[1:15:22] you you're not a son of God. To try to
[1:15:24] tell you you're not a daughter of God.
[1:15:26] Oh, but a vindicated prophet has come in
[1:15:28] this day and said, "Hey, come up higher.
[1:15:31] This is the bride age. This is the
[1:15:33] rapture age. You don't belong down here.
[1:15:36] You are an eagle."
[1:15:39] Hallelujah. I said you're an eagle,
[1:15:45] but there's another law waring within
[1:15:48] your
[1:15:49] members. And every time it gets a little
[1:15:53] traction and reminds you of your past
[1:15:55] and you make a mistake and and you
[1:15:58] didn't turn your head, but you you
[1:16:00] followed for a little bit and what do
[1:16:02] you do? Woe is me. I'm not a Christian.
[1:16:05] The message isn't true. No, man. Get to
[1:16:08] fighting.
[1:16:10] Say, you know what? I'm a son of God.
[1:16:12] God, give me the strength to turn my
[1:16:13] head next
[1:16:14] time. Sisters, be real ladies, real
[1:16:19] examples. Hold a
[1:16:20] standard. Hold a standard for these
[1:16:23] young men. Dress right. Possess your
[1:16:25] vessel in sanctification and
[1:16:28] honor. Boys, you protect your sisters.
[1:16:31] Don't be fancy talking them, making them
[1:16:34] uncomfortable, and corner them out. Be a
[1:16:37] man. go talk to their
[1:16:40] daddy. But the the message has to become
[1:16:43] flesh in you. But just because you make
[1:16:45] a
[1:16:45] mistake, come on. I don't know about
[1:16:48] you, but when I was in the word, I
[1:16:50] wasn't
[1:16:51] fighting. I was just going rolling with
[1:16:55] it. I had this quote. I even called uh
[1:16:58] my brother and asked for it because we
[1:17:00] were going to do questions and answers
[1:17:02] and and I wanted to read it and I didn't
[1:17:04] get to. So maybe this is what it was
[1:17:05] for. But this there's a brother uh
[1:17:08] talking to brother Brandham and he's
[1:17:09] saying, "Oh, brother Brandham, I have
[1:17:11] something inside of me. You know, I used
[1:17:13] to hate going to church. I I I used to
[1:17:15] to to hate doing these things and I
[1:17:17] would never go. But you know, then all
[1:17:18] of a sudden sudden I saw a little track
[1:17:21] and and it started me on this path and
[1:17:23] and I went to the Methodists and I went
[1:17:25] to the Baptists and I went to the
[1:17:26] Pentecostals and they said I had to jump
[1:17:28] and shout and they said I it was a rules
[1:17:30] and and things that I had to keep and
[1:17:32] and they said all this had to do and I
[1:17:34] come to find out I've done all these
[1:17:35] things and I ain't got
[1:17:38] it. Brother Bam looked he said you know
[1:17:41] let me ask you a question.
[1:17:44] You
[1:17:45] said that
[1:17:47] uh you used to not to like to go to
[1:17:51] church, but one day you were taking a
[1:17:55] piece of paper somebody handed you out
[1:17:56] of your pocket to throw it in the trash
[1:17:58] and it said, "What will you do for
[1:18:00] eternal life or or or will you make a
[1:18:02] surrender to God or something?" and he
[1:18:03] threw it in the trash. And he said
[1:18:04] something in his heart just kept coming
[1:18:07] back to him and he he picked it back up
[1:18:08] and he threw it down and he picked it
[1:18:10] back up and something uh uh struck
[1:18:12] inside of him and and he started to get
[1:18:14] hungry and thirsty for everlasting life.
[1:18:16] And so he started searching and brother
[1:18:18] Brandov said, "Brother, you got what you
[1:18:21] were looking for right then." And the
[1:18:24] brother started to weeping. He said,
[1:18:25] "Oh, I've had it all along.
[1:18:28] Look, I I can't tell you where you're in
[1:18:30] the road map of justification and
[1:18:32] sanctification of baptism of the Holy
[1:18:34] Ghost, but I want to say one thing. If
[1:18:35] you got a desire to serve God, you ought
[1:18:38] to thank God for a desire. You ought to
[1:18:40] thank God that you're sitting here on a
[1:18:42] Saturday night and Lady Oia, when
[1:18:45] wickedness and darkness is going on on
[1:18:47] the face of the earth, gross darkness
[1:18:49] upon the people, but arise and shine,
[1:18:52] thy light has come.
[1:18:55] So, I don't care how far you've come. I
[1:18:57] want to tell you, you're going all the
[1:18:59] way. You're going to make it. You want
[1:19:02] to know how I know you're going to make
[1:19:03] it? Cuz he wrote your name on the Lamb's
[1:19:05] Book of Life. And he said, "When you
[1:19:06] showed up in Lady Osia, your your soul
[1:19:09] was already sealed off. The devil can't
[1:19:11] even get to you."
[1:19:14] Now, don't use that for a reason to live
[1:19:17] in sin.
[1:19:21] The new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[1:19:23] Christ personally to
[1:19:24] you. And now the word is being made
[1:19:27] flesh in
[1:19:29] you. As we were saying, it's more than
[1:19:32] rules and
[1:19:36] regulations. It's a nature
[1:19:39] change. And so, Satan's always wanted to
[1:19:43] heap up condemnation.
[1:19:45] But one thing I realized in my life as a
[1:19:49] Christian, if I did something I didn't I
[1:19:53] knew that I shouldn't do, I learned to
[1:19:56] just understand that was the grace of
[1:19:59] God allowing me to see that there's more
[1:20:02] of a surrender that I can make.
[1:20:06] You following me?
[1:20:08] If you find that you're giving into a
[1:20:10] temptation, then what you want to do is
[1:20:13] say, "Lord, I realize I didn't have the
[1:20:15] strength. I realize that this flesh man
[1:20:18] is having an ability to make uh
[1:20:21] decisions that are contrary to the soul
[1:20:23] that's inside of me, Lord, and I want to
[1:20:25] I want to possess the land. I want to
[1:20:27] possess this vessel and sanctification
[1:20:29] and honor. And Lord, I see I'm
[1:20:30] struggling with this. And Lord, I want
[1:20:32] deliverance of it. Lord, deliver me.
[1:20:34] Help me to feed on your word and to get
[1:20:36] into prayer, Lord." So next time that
[1:20:38] temptation comes, I'll have the strength
[1:20:40] to overcome
[1:20:42] it. Now I want to tell you, if you keep
[1:20:44] going through cycles and never get the
[1:20:46] victory over that thing, I say come to
[1:20:48] an altar. Come get prayed for. I have
[1:20:50] some brothers and tell them, "Look, man,
[1:20:51] I've been battling this thing and I
[1:20:53] can't get the victory over it." But some
[1:20:56] of us let pride just hold us in bondage.
[1:20:59] You know, it's okay to need help.
[1:21:04] We had we had some youth on their way to
[1:21:06] camp coming up here and you know what
[1:21:07] happened? I thought it was quite kind of
[1:21:09] amazing if you know you don't want to
[1:21:11] make everything super spiritual but it
[1:21:12] was just amazing how all this worked
[1:21:14] out. But we we took off down the road
[1:21:16] and we left something at the place we
[1:21:17] were staying. So we had to turn around
[1:21:19] and go back and get
[1:21:21] it. While we're doing that, Brother Ron
[1:21:23] just felt, you know what, I need to go
[1:21:24] by the church, pick something up. Well,
[1:21:28] little did I know that little delay in
[1:21:29] time that I had to turn around and go
[1:21:31] back caused me to be driving up the
[1:21:33] highway and there we saw uh uh you know
[1:21:35] you know what why we stopped I'm sorry I
[1:21:38] don't stop as often as I used to with my
[1:21:40] family and kids in the car but we saw
[1:21:43] somebody with a skirt on
[1:21:46] and and they did also have other people
[1:21:47] that had pushed them out of the way and
[1:21:49] were being a help but I was pulling up
[1:21:50] the road one of the the girls said hey
[1:21:52] they were wearing a skirt. I'm like hey
[1:21:54] I wonder if it's one of ours. So, we
[1:21:55] pulled over and we back up. Now, we
[1:21:58] would have been past them if we wouldn't
[1:22:00] have had to turn around.
[1:22:02] And then, Brother Ron fell to go by the
[1:22:04] church and one of our youth members in
[1:22:06] our church was sitting up there with his
[1:22:08] bags and had missed the ride.
[1:22:12] And so, now they're climbing up the hill
[1:22:14] and they go by and and and and brother
[1:22:16] Josh, he goes, "Hey, I think that was
[1:22:18] brother Matthew." So, m it's possible if
[1:22:21] he wasn't in the car, they might have
[1:22:23] just kept on going down the way. So
[1:22:24] then, Brother Ron pulls over. So then I
[1:22:26] thought, hey, you know, camp's going to
[1:22:28] do good when you you've already started
[1:22:30] on the side of the
[1:22:31] road. I was like, man, when you start
[1:22:33] having troubles and things start
[1:22:34] happening, but could you imagine if we
[1:22:36] would have pulled over and they said,
[1:22:38] "Nope, I'm
[1:22:39] predestinated. Going to be at camp. I'm
[1:22:41] an overcomer." Y'all go ahead.
[1:22:44] But y'all don't need no help. No, we're
[1:22:46] good. I'm an overcomer. I'm seated in
[1:22:48] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I'm
[1:22:50] going all the way. Who said I couldn't
[1:22:51] make it to camp even without a car?
[1:22:55] Glory. Are you kidding me? You get some
[1:22:58] people, they're so supernatural, they're
[1:22:59] of no earthly good.
[1:23:03] I'm telling you, they're just so
[1:23:04] spiritual and and it's just a bunch of
[1:23:06] buzzwords. You know, you're the son of
[1:23:09] man.
[1:23:11] Why didn't you shout and scream? Right?
[1:23:14] But then when it comes to a life, when
[1:23:16] it comes to an ability, and a lot of
[1:23:18] those personalities that have come up
[1:23:20] with all those things, they've done hit
[1:23:21] the ditch and taken people way off in
[1:23:23] the middle of nowhere. But sometimes
[1:23:25] what I'm trying to get to, we need help.
[1:23:29] And you know what? We were able to help
[1:23:30] them. We were able to call tow truck and
[1:23:32] get them towed and some hopped in with
[1:23:34] brother Ron and we all and hey, they
[1:23:35] made it. And I want to tell you what,
[1:23:38] none of us could make it if we didn't
[1:23:40] have help.
[1:23:42] And sometimes, you know what? you just
[1:23:44] got to
[1:23:45] do is just say,
[1:23:47] "Lord, I need your help."
[1:23:54] Because we're talking about a nature
[1:23:56] change and sometimes you just need to
[1:23:59] say,
[1:24:00] "Lord, this thing's bigger than me." I
[1:24:02] told you my
[1:24:03] testimony. And if we're talking about a
[1:24:06] nature, Brother Brandon would use the
[1:24:07] example many times about how you can
[1:24:10] clean up a pig and get it all. Oh, man.
[1:24:12] You could put deodorant and cologne on
[1:24:14] that thing and my you could just make it
[1:24:17] look all nice and everything, but what
[1:24:18] is that thing going to do? It's going to
[1:24:21] run right back out to the manure pile.
[1:24:24] Now, if you leave this camp and you run
[1:24:29] back out to the manure pile, what are
[1:24:31] you going to
[1:24:35] do? I tell you this. You want to know
[1:24:38] what you want to do? Say, "Lord, forgive
[1:24:41] me. I failed again, but I know your
[1:24:44] grace and your mercy called me. And
[1:24:46] Lord, maybe I didn't get baptized. Maybe
[1:24:47] I didn't get filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:49] But Lord, I know that you started a work
[1:24:51] in me. And I know that you'll finish it.
[1:24:53] And Lord, I believe you'll give me the
[1:24:54] strength. Lord, I'm going to start
[1:24:56] hating that thing. I'm going to start uh
[1:24:58] starving that thing. I'm going to start
[1:24:59] praying more. I'm going to start reading
[1:25:01] my Bible more. I'm going to start
[1:25:03] believing more. I'm going to start
[1:25:04] listening to more tapes. I'm going to
[1:25:05] get to church earlier. I'm going to get
[1:25:07] on my knees. I'm going to ask my youth
[1:25:08] to pray with me. I'm going to ask my
[1:25:10] pastor. See, look what happened.
[1:25:11] Whatever happened to getting into
[1:25:13] desperation?
[1:25:16] We get so comfortable and ladies, you'll
[1:25:17] see we're not desperate for anything.
[1:25:20] But brother Brandon said, "You let
[1:25:22] somebody get hungry and I'll fill you
[1:25:23] out of a garbage can." But oh, we got a
[1:25:25] seven course meal spread before our
[1:25:27] saints. I tell you, if you're not seeing
[1:25:29] the fruits of Christ in your life, then
[1:25:31] hey, let's repent and let it be a God
[1:25:33] showing you, son, there's more for you.
[1:25:36] Not not you'll never make it. You're not
[1:25:38] good. That's the devil's language. And
[1:25:41] so many times when we fall and make a
[1:25:43] mistake and we realize we're maybe not
[1:25:45] in the stature of a perfect man where we
[1:25:47] need to be, we start listening to the
[1:25:49] devil. You're not a son of God. You're
[1:25:51] an impostor. You'll never be able to
[1:25:54] overcome. Well, how do you know that's a
[1:25:56] lie? Cuz he's telling you when that dude
[1:26:00] is running his mouth, it's a lie.
[1:26:03] But the word has come to tell you who
[1:26:05] you are. So, who are you gonna take
[1:26:08] sides
[1:26:11] with? Right? You can clean up a pig, but
[1:26:14] it's going to go right back out in the
[1:26:16] waller. Now, just to lay in a a little
[1:26:18] scripture here in Matthew 24. Everybody
[1:26:20] feeling all
[1:26:22] right? Matthew
[1:26:24] 24:42, Jesus says, "Watch therefore, for
[1:26:27] you know not what hour your Lord doth
[1:26:28] come.
[1:26:31] But know this, that if the good man of
[1:26:33] the house had not known in what watched
[1:26:35] the thief would come, he would have he
[1:26:37] would have watched and would not have
[1:26:38] suffered. His house should be broken up.
[1:26:40] Now, brother Brandon would tie Matthew
[1:26:43] 24:42 to Luke 11:24, which says, "When
[1:26:45] an unclean spirit is gone out of a man,
[1:26:47] he walketh through dry places seeking
[1:26:49] rest, and if findeth none," he say, If I
[1:26:52] will return unto my house whence I came
[1:26:55] out, and if he finds the place swept and
[1:26:58] garnish, he takes seven other spirits.
[1:26:59] And the last day was worse than the
[1:27:02] first. And brother Brandham said, "The
[1:27:03] good man of the house is your
[1:27:06] faith." The good man of the house says,
[1:27:08] "Stay away." When that devil comes back
[1:27:11] knocking, faith has to have muscles on
[1:27:13] it. Say, "Devil, I ain't buying it
[1:27:15] again. I've fallen before, but you've
[1:27:18] tried to trick me. You've tried to rob
[1:27:20] me of my joy, and I know that God did
[1:27:22] something real for me. I don't want to
[1:27:24] listen to that music. I don't want to
[1:27:26] look at them girls. I don't want to go
[1:27:27] on them websites. I don't want to Look
[1:27:29] at that entertainment. Get out of here,
[1:27:31] devil.
[1:27:33] Faith has a voice.
[1:27:36] And some of us just need to start
[1:27:38] speaking the word.
[1:27:41] Faith is a revelation, something that's
[1:27:43] revealed to
[1:27:45] you. Who do you say that I am? Remember
[1:27:47] this happened in the scripture. Uh,
[1:27:49] brother Steven hit on it. It's that
[1:27:52] Jesus came to the disciples and said,
[1:27:53] "Who do men say I am?" Oh, some say thou
[1:27:56] are Elias. Some say that are that are
[1:27:57] John. Some say this, but then he made it
[1:28:00] personal. Who do you say I, the son of
[1:28:05] man,
[1:28:06] am? And Peter said those wonderful
[1:28:09] words, thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:28:12] the living God. And Jesus said, Simon
[1:28:15] Barjonah, flesh and blood have not
[1:28:17] revealed that to you, but my father
[1:28:19] which is in heaven hath revealed that to
[1:28:21] you, and upon this uh uh revelation, the
[1:28:24] gates of hell will not prevail.
[1:28:27] Now I want to ask you, it has to come to
[1:28:29] the same place now. And I ask you, who
[1:28:33] do you say the message of the hour is?
[1:28:36] Who do you say the message is? Well,
[1:28:39] some say some say it's it's Malachi 4:5
[1:28:43] and and Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10
[1:28:47] 1-7. Who do you say the message of the
[1:28:50] hour is? Now, you can give a good
[1:28:52] intellectual regurgitation of what it
[1:28:55] is. And I uh one time had a brother come
[1:28:58] to me. He he sat in a a a church. He's
[1:29:01] gone on to be with the the Lord now. And
[1:29:03] and uh he he sat in a good church for 30
[1:29:06] plus years and and was taught right and
[1:29:09] and uh you know he he'd gotten his life
[1:29:12] together over the last 15 20 years and
[1:29:13] and and and and always went to church
[1:29:16] and and was faithful. And one day we got
[1:29:18] done with some meetings and I and I come
[1:29:20] over there and he's a big man. He he he
[1:29:22] he pulled a chair up like this with the
[1:29:25] the back facing me and straddled that
[1:29:26] and put his hands on the arms and he
[1:29:28] looked at me. He said, "Brother, what is
[1:29:30] the Holy
[1:29:32] Ghost?" And I looked at him and I'm
[1:29:34] like, "Oh
[1:29:36] my, this brother does not." And he meant
[1:29:39] it. And I thought, "Lord, there's
[1:29:41] nothing I can tell this man that he
[1:29:43] doesn't already
[1:29:45] know." So I started praying. I said,
[1:29:48] "Lord, help me." I said, 'Well, brother,
[1:29:52] uh, this is all unplanned, so if just
[1:29:54] help me, Lord. I said, 'Brother, I Why
[1:29:57] do you ask?' He says, ' Because I don't
[1:29:58] got it.' I said, '
[1:30:01] Okay. Said, "Well, do you you you
[1:30:05] believe the message of the hour?" He
[1:30:06] goes, "With all my heart." I said,
[1:30:08] "Okay." I mean, are
[1:30:11] you you living a sanctified life? He
[1:30:13] goes, "Yeah." He says, "But I hate going
[1:30:16] to church. I can't stand it.
[1:30:20] I said, "Oh, okay. All right.
[1:30:24] Huh. Well, what what good is it going to
[1:30:26] do to and and I'm I'm I'm being honest.
[1:30:28] I'm like, man, I'm like, what Lord, help
[1:30:30] me
[1:30:31] here, Lord, what what is I'm" I'm like,
[1:30:33] "Well, you know, I said, "Brother, what
[1:30:35] what what the Holy Ghost is to me is,
[1:30:38] you know,
[1:30:39] the only thing I can tell you, brother,
[1:30:42] is, you know, I was I I needed help one
[1:30:44] day, and I was in
[1:30:46] bondage, and I need I needed to change.
[1:30:48] I I couldn't help myself and I got
[1:30:52] desperate and I started to call on the
[1:30:53] name of the Lord and somehow he'd come
[1:30:56] and he changed my heart and and I've
[1:30:59] never been the same and I said I I said
[1:31:03] that's what the Holy Ghost is to
[1:31:05] me and he thought about he goes you know
[1:31:09] I've talked to a little a lot of good
[1:31:11] men and that's the best answer I've ever
[1:31:14] heard because he he wasn't looking for
[1:31:17] something intellectual
[1:31:20] He was looking for something he could
[1:31:22] identify
[1:31:24] with. And I said, "I want to ask you
[1:31:26] something,
[1:31:27] brother." I said,
[1:31:31] "Uh, you said that you hate going to
[1:31:34] church." Said, "Yeah." I said, "I want
[1:31:36] to ask you something. You're a pretty
[1:31:39] big man. You're
[1:31:41] 6'4,
[1:31:43] 350bs." He's a big man. Mountain of a
[1:31:45] man. I said, 'I want to ask you
[1:31:47] something. Do you think I can move you
[1:31:49] out of that chair? He said, ' Not a
[1:31:51] chance.' Said, 'Really, you don't think
[1:31:53] I can move you out of the chair?' He
[1:31:54] said, 'Not a chance.' I said, okay,
[1:31:56] well, I want to ask you something then.
[1:31:58] If you hate going to
[1:32:01] church, then what's been bringing you
[1:32:03] all these
[1:32:06] years? And in that simple
[1:32:10] moment, that brother had a breakthrough
[1:32:12] and realized he had always had what he
[1:32:16] had been looking
[1:32:19] for. And some of you young
[1:32:21] people, you have a call on your
[1:32:24] life. You've responded to the word.
[1:32:27] You've dug out the
[1:32:29] dishes. And you keep seeking for
[1:32:31] something you already got.
[1:32:36] And the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:32:37] in your mind. So it's not so important
[1:32:40] of you being able to look at the road
[1:32:42] map and be like, I'm at this mile
[1:32:44] marker. Exactly. But I want to I want to
[1:32:46] ask you, are you walking with
[1:32:48] him? And if you're walking with him,
[1:32:51] then everything's going to be okay,
[1:32:52] young people.
[1:32:55] It's when you stop walking with him
[1:33:02] and go back to where you left
[1:33:06] him. It's not complicated. I believe
[1:33:09] there's a story about some man that was
[1:33:11] about to die and he wanted Christ and
[1:33:14] maybe he was dying his he was dying out
[1:33:15] on the battlefield and he wanted Christ.
[1:33:18] He wanted to be saved and he said,
[1:33:20] "Gobie, go back to where you left him."
[1:33:21] And he said, "Now I lay me down to
[1:33:23] sleep." He went all the way back to when
[1:33:26] he was just a baby and his mama reading
[1:33:28] them a little Bible stories. I want to
[1:33:30] tell you Jesus has always been there.
[1:33:37] We got to make a conscious
[1:33:39] decision to cross over
[1:33:43] to go on with
[1:33:46] God. And when you find out that you're
[1:33:49] feeding on the things of the world,
[1:33:51] you're walking away from
[1:33:54] him. Recognize and say, you know what,
[1:33:56] I'm I don't want to do that anymore. I'm
[1:33:59] tired of that. I know where this takes
[1:34:01] me.
[1:34:03] You know, the the the day and age we
[1:34:05] live in, I tell you what, when when when
[1:34:06] it comes on your heart to read your
[1:34:08] Bible and pray, you better do it right
[1:34:09] away.
[1:34:10] You better do it right away. And and I
[1:34:12] would encourage you to not do it on your
[1:34:14] phone because I have wanted to study and
[1:34:17] read my Bible and I end up doing
[1:34:19] something other than doing what I wanted
[1:34:21] to
[1:34:22] do. You will get distracted. You will uh
[1:34:26] you will end up doing so many things and
[1:34:27] because all of our work and so many
[1:34:29] things are on our phone, so many
[1:34:31] distractions
[1:34:35] You got to feed that inward man. If you
[1:34:37] ever want to overcome, if you ever want
[1:34:39] to keep going on with God, you got to
[1:34:40] start feeding the inward man. And you
[1:34:43] got to start doing battle and recognize,
[1:34:45] hey, man, there's another nature that's
[1:34:47] trying to hang on me. But that thing got
[1:34:48] to die.
[1:34:51] All right, we doing okay?
[1:34:54] Who do you say the message of the hour
[1:34:56] is?
[1:34:59] It's to
[1:35:01] me it's the Lord Jesus Christ. It's that
[1:35:04] Holy Ghost that came to me and changed
[1:35:07] my life. And now I I've come into a
[1:35:10] union with him. And I and I realize if I
[1:35:13] want to get to know him more, I have to
[1:35:15] hear his voice. Some of some of you
[1:35:17] young people here, you are in a
[1:35:18] relationship. And and and some of you
[1:35:20] are, oh my, you just man, you know how
[1:35:22] it is. You Twitter paded. You know, you
[1:35:24] look at the girl you love and man, all
[1:35:26] them emotions just just kind of, oh,
[1:35:28] wow, man. Well, you know, sometimes that
[1:35:30] happens. Maybe some people, oh, love at
[1:35:32] first sight. But I tell you, a you as
[1:35:34] you as you maybe get start to get to
[1:35:36] know somebody, right, and you're
[1:35:38] starting to nurture those emotions that
[1:35:39] a relationship
[1:35:41] grows. Don't you realize the message is
[1:35:44] God's grace and love to you?
[1:35:48] Oh, if you want to get to know the Lord
[1:35:51] Jesus more, read your Bible.
[1:35:54] Pray.
[1:35:55] Put on a tape. Say, "Lord, would you
[1:35:58] talk to me for a while? I want to
[1:36:01] overcome." Faith comes by hearing the
[1:36:04] word. And faith is the victory that
[1:36:07] overcomes the world. And some of us are
[1:36:09] expecting to be superch Christian
[1:36:11] message believers and we're not even
[1:36:13] listening to the message.
[1:36:16] We're not even getting to church 30
[1:36:18] minutes early to create an atmosphere.
[1:36:20] We have no expectation for the word. and
[1:36:22] all the expectation for our career and
[1:36:24] our relationships in the world. And you
[1:36:26] wonder why you're struggling. It's not
[1:36:28] hard to figure out, young people. You
[1:36:31] are called. You are elected. You are the
[1:36:33] predestinated. But you got a job to do.
[1:36:36] And I want to tell you, Christ is the
[1:36:38] anointing that comes upon the word
[1:36:40] that's already in your soul to make you
[1:36:42] go to work.
[1:36:46] Prophet of God says this in unfa in the
[1:36:49] unfailing realities of the living God.
[1:36:50] He says, "And we must learn that God is
[1:36:53] not known by intellectual conception.
[1:36:55] God is known by the new birth, by the
[1:36:57] Holy Ghost, not by any other way."
[1:36:59] Jesus, the Bible, has plainly quoted us
[1:37:01] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:37:03] only by the Holy Ghost. And if you've
[1:37:05] never received the Holy Ghost, you don't
[1:37:08] know that he is the Christ, for that's
[1:37:09] the only way he reveals
[1:37:11] himself. You're not converted until you
[1:37:14] receive the Holy Ghost. The Bible said
[1:37:16] so. After Peter had uh both been saved
[1:37:18] and sanctified, give power to cast out
[1:37:20] unclean spirits and to preach the
[1:37:22] gospel, Jesus plainly told him he was
[1:37:24] not
[1:37:25] converted until he received the Holy
[1:37:28] Ghost. He said, "After you are
[1:37:29] converted, then strengthen the brother."
[1:37:31] That was on the night of the betrayal
[1:37:33] that he was not yet converted. And no
[1:37:35] man is truly converted until he has been
[1:37:38] changed and died to himself. And the
[1:37:40] Holy Spirit has control of that person.
[1:37:46] Now I uh just Lord help me here
[1:37:49] but there to me if I can maybe look back
[1:37:53] in my own
[1:37:54] experience I remember oh my I tell you
[1:37:58] there's there's nothing like
[1:38:00] it. I mean when when that you if it's
[1:38:04] never happened to you you're you're like
[1:38:06] under this big huge you're living with
[1:38:07] this big huge pressure of sin and you
[1:38:11] don't even know it. It's like it's like
[1:38:14] you've been riding a bike up I17 your
[1:38:17] whole life and didn't know you could be
[1:38:19] in a
[1:38:20] Fiori. It's it's like you've just been
[1:38:23] laboring and struggling your whole life
[1:38:26] and and wondering. But oh my, when
[1:38:29] you're converted and born again and set
[1:38:30] free, you're like, "Woo, let me tell you
[1:38:33] what God did for me. I once was this
[1:38:36] way, but I ain't the same way anymore."
[1:38:38] I tell you, if you don't know who Jesus
[1:38:40] is, you got to meet him. He'll set you
[1:38:42] free. He'll break the shackles of sin
[1:38:44] and change your desires. Oh, you're like
[1:38:46] a house on fire on a windy day. You want
[1:38:48] everybody to get saved. You want
[1:38:50] everybody to meet this Jesus that you've
[1:38:52] met. You just got to testify because my
[1:38:54] I mean, if he did that for me, he could
[1:38:56] do that for you. And and if the love of
[1:38:58] God is now coming in your life and it's
[1:38:59] the Holy Ghost in you, my you like, man,
[1:39:01] I I want other people to experience
[1:39:04] this. I don't know about you, but when I
[1:39:06] was in the world, when I got a hold of
[1:39:07] good stuff, I wanted other people to try
[1:39:09] it. When you get a hold of good food,
[1:39:11] you want people to take take care of
[1:39:12] good food. If you get a hold of the
[1:39:13] message of the hour, hey, you want other
[1:39:15] people to try
[1:39:18] it. But you see, I I I I'll never forget
[1:39:20] it was like maybe a week later, I was
[1:39:23] working at my job and and lunch break
[1:39:25] come up and I'm like, man, okay, I'll go
[1:39:27] have a beer. I got about five steps. I
[1:39:32] went, I don't even
[1:39:36] drink. That's funny. What am I going to
[1:39:39] do
[1:39:39] now? Now, if I would have gotten five
[1:39:42] steps down and went, "Oh, man. I can't
[1:39:45] do that. I'm a
[1:39:48] Christian. Wrong nature. I haven't had
[1:39:51] the change
[1:39:52] yet." You see the difference? Now, it
[1:39:55] doesn't mean you can't that doesn't mean
[1:39:57] I couldn't be tempted to things, but you
[1:39:59] see there that that old nature was gone.
[1:40:02] The things I I used to do, I don't do
[1:40:05] them no more.
[1:40:07] So then when you've had that nature
[1:40:09] change, then you've been set free. Now,
[1:40:12] now God's not going to push you through
[1:40:13] a pipe and pull you out on the other end
[1:40:15] and say, "Well done, my good and
[1:40:16] faithful servant." You will have
[1:40:18] besetting sins and things that you got
[1:40:20] to guard yourself against. Some people
[1:40:22] your struggle really might be music. And
[1:40:25] you might find out, and I want to tell
[1:40:27] you, you can struggle with things while
[1:40:29] having the Holy Ghost. Look, I you
[1:40:32] forgive me if somebody teaches it the
[1:40:34] other way, but you want to come
[1:40:35] toe-to-toe with me. And I'll tell you in
[1:40:37] the name of the Lord, I got baptized and
[1:40:39] filled with the Holy Ghost in December
[1:40:40] of 1999. And I've never been the same.
[1:40:43] And no man can ever take that away from
[1:40:47] me. But if you want to try to tell me I
[1:40:49] ain't made mistakes since
[1:40:52] then, I'm
[1:40:54] ashamed. I have. And I've actually done
[1:40:57] some things that a son of God should
[1:40:58] have never
[1:41:00] done. And I've been vexed by it.
[1:41:05] But to me, that right there shows the
[1:41:08] nature
[1:41:09] change because my soul's
[1:41:13] fixed. But if if you're able to do those
[1:41:17] things and continue to do them for a
[1:41:20] season, you you still got the wrong
[1:41:23] nature. I'm sorry. You You got the wrong
[1:41:26] nature. But if you've been changed and
[1:41:29] you come up to maybe it's music and and
[1:41:31] and or maybe maybe you've been battling
[1:41:34] with lust and and and maybe you haven't
[1:41:36] been reading and praying and all a
[1:41:38] sudden you actually you you you look for
[1:41:40] for longer than you should have or you
[1:41:42] you got off on the wrong website and all
[1:41:44] a sudden in your heart you're like, "Oh
[1:41:45] God, I did it again. Lord, forgive me. I
[1:41:47] don't want to do that." That's
[1:41:49] good. That's very good. That shows
[1:41:53] there's something inside of you that's
[1:41:55] different. the old nature would just
[1:41:57] enjoy it and continue to want to do it.
[1:41:59] But now there's a good man of the house
[1:42:01] of faith saying, "I don't want to do
[1:42:03] that. I'm ashamed of myself. Lord,
[1:42:05] forgive me once again. Lord, bring your
[1:42:07] Holy Spirit back to me. May I read and
[1:42:09] pray, Lord, that next time the
[1:42:10] temptation comes, I'll overcome."
[1:42:15] But in that moment, there's another
[1:42:17] thing waring in your members. See told
[1:42:19] you, you don't got it. You are not the
[1:42:22] bride. You're not even bride material.
[1:42:24] You might as well just start handing out
[1:42:25] bottles of water cuz that's the only way
[1:42:27] you're going to make
[1:42:29] it. You you know the quote,
[1:42:32] right? All right. Good. Talking to the
[1:42:35] right
[1:42:36] people. Prophet said, "Some people make
[1:42:38] it in just by giving a bottle to the
[1:42:40] elect, a glass of water to the
[1:42:42] elect." But you see what I'm trying to
[1:42:45] point out to you. Some people struggle.
[1:42:47] But you see, we are now living in the
[1:42:49] age of adoption. We're now living in the
[1:42:52] hour of manifested sons and daughters of
[1:42:54] God where now we are taking the book and
[1:42:57] eating it. We must prophesy again. We
[1:43:00] are living in the age of the change of
[1:43:02] our bodies where in a moment in a
[1:43:04] twinkling of an eye we can be changed.
[1:43:06] So we want to go into all the promises
[1:43:08] of God and totally possess the land. And
[1:43:10] I want to tell you, when you get a
[1:43:12] nature change and you start to see the
[1:43:14] message of the hour and the effects that
[1:43:16] it had in the prophet's life, something
[1:43:19] in you hungers and longs for that same
[1:43:21] nature and
[1:43:22] character, that humility, that meekness,
[1:43:25] that sensitivity. Lord, is that
[1:43:28] you? But we get so far away from that.
[1:43:32] And when we do, that's when you have to
[1:43:34] start recognizing, you know what? I I'm
[1:43:36] I'm starting to walk away from God
[1:43:37] again. I can't do that. I got to get
[1:43:39] back. I got to go back to where I left
[1:43:41] him. I got to start reading. I got to
[1:43:43] start praying. So, you have to look at
[1:43:44] some of your mistakes and failures. Is
[1:43:46] it shouldn't be condemnation because my
[1:43:48] Bible tells me there's therefore now no
[1:43:50] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:43:51] Jesus.
[1:43:53] Satan wants to condemn you and keep you
[1:43:55] in that place. And I want to tell you,
[1:43:56] the longer you wait to repent and the
[1:43:59] longer you stoop in it, the longer
[1:44:00] you'll remain in that condition. We are
[1:44:02] not Catholics. You do not have to beat
[1:44:04] yourself up and say, "Me a Koopa."
[1:44:07] So many people want to go to the pastor
[1:44:09] and say, "Brother Ron, I failed. I made
[1:44:11] a mistake. What should I do?" Are
[1:44:15] you repent? Like, tell them you're
[1:44:18] sorry.
[1:44:23] Right. I mean, but we want to be good
[1:44:26] message Catholics. No, brother. You mean
[1:44:29] I I don't have to walk on my ease down
[1:44:31] the I I17
[1:44:32] corridor and say Jesus loves you with a
[1:44:35] sign and then after I do that in 117
[1:44:39] degree weather on the black top I can be
[1:44:42] forgiven. Oh no. Oh no. I'm so thankful
[1:44:46] I serve a God who's rich in grace and
[1:44:49] mercy. I I can walk away from him for
[1:44:52] one day, one week, one month, one year,
[1:44:56] 10 years, and he'll be right there
[1:44:57] waiting every single time. If you give
[1:45:00] him second place, he'll take it. If you
[1:45:02] give him fifth place, he'll take it. If
[1:45:04] you give him a hundth place, he'll take
[1:45:05] it. He's a gentleman. He'll wait. But I
[1:45:08] said, "God, forgive me. May I give you
[1:45:11] the first place? I failed you time and
[1:45:13] time again. And Lord, I don't ever want
[1:45:15] to fail you again.
[1:45:19] May I love you like you deserve to be
[1:45:21] loved. And yes, I'm still in this flesh.
[1:45:23] I'm going to fall again. I know
[1:45:25] it. But he'll be right there. Say,
[1:45:30] "Lord, I didn't pass the test this time,
[1:45:33] but I know you. Will you let me? Will
[1:45:35] you give me another chance?" Oh, now
[1:45:37] we're growing up. See, when you start
[1:45:40] realizing that you are called to be an
[1:45:42] overcomer and that thing you've been
[1:45:44] struggling with, you are called to
[1:45:45] defeat that thing. That demon that's
[1:45:48] been coming after you, that demon that's
[1:45:50] trying to haunt you, that music that's
[1:45:51] trying to get you all bound, you are
[1:45:53] called to put that under your feet. You
[1:45:56] are not called to compromise. This young
[1:45:59] people should never make a deal with the
[1:46:01] devil. I will not settle for nothing
[1:46:04] less than total victory. And I will
[1:46:06] preach this message in such a way till
[1:46:08] every young person can come to complete
[1:46:11] and total victory.
[1:46:15] no room for
[1:46:17] compromise. But when you walk away, what
[1:46:19] do you do? You
[1:46:21] repent. But I I tried to give an example
[1:46:25] to where now the Holy Spirit has control
[1:46:27] of that person. See, my nature was
[1:46:29] changed. So then maybe out of habit or
[1:46:32] out of routine, I would go to start do
[1:46:34] things that I used to do. But since my
[1:46:37] nature had
[1:46:39] changed, I didn't desire to do it
[1:46:44] anymore. Is that simple enough, young
[1:46:46] people? So, when the Holy Spirit has
[1:46:48] control, oh my, it's happened again, but
[1:46:51] we get overtime
[1:46:53] tonight. So, when the Holy Spirit has
[1:46:56] control, it there's headship, there's
[1:46:58] leadership, it's the Holy Spirit now
[1:47:01] controlling the individual's life.
[1:47:03] Romans 12:2
[1:47:09] Paul says, "And be not conformed to this
[1:47:11] world, but be transformed by the
[1:47:13] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:47:15] what is good and acceptable in the
[1:47:17] perfect will of God." How do you prove
[1:47:19] what is good and acceptable and perfect
[1:47:20] will of
[1:47:21] God? It takes a transformation or
[1:47:24] renewing of the mind by the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:26] Brother Brandon said, "I believe in the
[1:47:28] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:47:30] through the word." Continuing on in this
[1:47:33] quote, should I stand you up and sit you
[1:47:35] down? Are y'all getting tired? Are you
[1:47:37] okay? Coming to the home stretch now.
[1:47:39] The Holy Spirit will not misbehave
[1:47:41] itself in one person and behave itself
[1:47:44] in another person. It'll make each
[1:47:46] person come into its character. See,
[1:47:48] because it's a spirit that leads you. It
[1:47:51] brings it makes you subject to its
[1:47:53] nature. You don't bring it subject to
[1:47:55] your nature. That's what religion is.
[1:47:57] people find the religion or find the
[1:48:00] church. You know, some in some areas we
[1:48:02] got a lot of church hopping because
[1:48:03] people just want to make the church fit
[1:48:05] them.
[1:48:07] Hey, I'm sorry to say it. They don't got
[1:48:08] enough love and grace to sit around
[1:48:10] enough for a while and maybe pray and
[1:48:12] and just have a little grace for the
[1:48:14] church and have a little grace for the
[1:48:15] pastor. Nobody wants to be God in the
[1:48:17] equation.
[1:48:18] Well, my goodness, if they did, I'll
[1:48:20] just go somewhere else. And then
[1:48:23] everybody ruins their testimony. They
[1:48:24] get over here and be like, well, why'd
[1:48:25] you come here? Well, they did. I'm like,
[1:48:27] "Oh, great. It's another one of them.
[1:48:31] Sorry about it. It's the truth."
[1:48:35] And you know what? It's usually just a
[1:48:36] little bit of time till they find
[1:48:37] something else that's wrong and they're
[1:48:38] on the the message Mary goround.
[1:48:42] But if we' ever get some real Holy Ghost
[1:48:45] conviction in our life and be the God in
[1:48:47] the situation, nobody wants to be the
[1:48:48] God in the equation. No one wants to be
[1:48:50] the one to forgive. No one wants to be
[1:48:52] the one to pray. Everybody just wants to
[1:48:54] be the super message believer and wants
[1:48:55] everybody else to be the super message
[1:48:57] believer. And nobody ever has any
[1:48:58] problems. And if there's any problems,
[1:49:00] it's not my fault, it's your fault. And
[1:49:01] you're just not a Christian. And brother
[1:49:02] Random said this and Brother Random said
[1:49:04] that and and you're not going in the
[1:49:05] rapture. I'm just the only one. I'm
[1:49:07] going to go live on the desert all by
[1:49:08] myself and just listen to tapes.
[1:49:14] Great job,
[1:49:16] guy. You're a real Christian.
[1:49:21] You got to be the God in the situation.
[1:49:26] When somebody does you wrong, what do
[1:49:28] you do? Get do them wrong back.
[1:49:32] No, don't do
[1:49:35] that. That's another nature.
[1:49:40] See, God gives you plenty of
[1:49:42] opportunities to realize there's more of
[1:49:44] a surrender. There's more of a dying to
[1:49:46] self. There's more of God and less of
[1:49:48] me.
[1:49:50] And if you get tired of battling
[1:49:52] something, get the victory over it, man.
[1:49:57] And next time that devil shows up, like
[1:49:58] you again, huh, buddy? I knocked you out
[1:50:01] the last time because greater is he that
[1:50:03] is in
[1:50:04] me. Come on. Greater is he that is in me
[1:50:08] than that pornography. Greater is he
[1:50:10] that is in me than that depression.
[1:50:12] Greater is he that is in me than that
[1:50:13] sickness. Greater is he that is in me
[1:50:16] than that website. Oh, devil, you showed
[1:50:18] up again. But the good man of the house
[1:50:20] is here. Shut up, you old devil. I got
[1:50:23] the Holy Ghost. I got the victory. I got
[1:50:26] something out there on the mountain in
[1:50:27] that desert, and I've never been the
[1:50:30] same. Boo, devil.
[1:50:34] Hallelujah. Now, we're talking about
[1:50:37] overcoming.
[1:50:39] Now, we're talking about being
[1:50:43] victorious. I I have some examples in
[1:50:45] here. We'll try to move quickly. We're
[1:50:47] getting really close out of time, but
[1:50:51] hallelujah. I'm feeling pretty good.
[1:50:54] Glory to God. I feel like somebody's
[1:50:56] about to have a breakthrough. I feel
[1:50:58] like somebody's starting to recognize
[1:50:59] their position in Christ. They're
[1:51:01] starting to recognize, you know what? I
[1:51:03] am a son of God. I do got the Holy
[1:51:05] Ghost. I can do the greater works. I can
[1:51:08] fulfill Mark 16. I am a son of God. I am
[1:51:11] going in the rapture. Hey, you old
[1:51:13] devil, you come too late. I've already
[1:51:15] heard the eagle scream. I am a son of
[1:51:17] God. My name is written on the lamb's
[1:51:19] book of life. Oh, devil, you are
[1:51:22] defeated. You tried to run me down long
[1:51:24] enough, but now I know who I am. Christ
[1:51:28] in me, the hope of glory. Get back,
[1:51:30] devil. I'm taking my mountain.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah. Make way.
[1:51:39] Oh, now that's a son of God that's
[1:51:40] starting to know who he is. And you know
[1:51:42] what's awesome about that? When you get
[1:51:44] the victory for yourself, you want to
[1:51:47] start helping fighting other
[1:51:48] ones. But when did the message
[1:51:52] become like we're on the
[1:51:55] defensive? Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.
[1:52:01] Oh, there's no armor on my back, so I'll
[1:52:03] just learn to run backwards really fast.
[1:52:06] Oh no, it's another one. Brother on,
[1:52:08] help me. Oh no, it's another one. music,
[1:52:11] depression. Oh my goodness, what am I
[1:52:13] going to do? We're We're always trying
[1:52:16] to get ourselves
[1:52:19] right. Brothers,
[1:52:21] sisters, you are called to be an
[1:52:24] invincible army marching onward.
[1:52:28] Christian soldier. Hey, brother. Brother
[1:52:31] so and so is really struggling. Let's
[1:52:34] get in prayer for him. Hey, now we're
[1:52:36] like Abraham.
[1:52:38] When Abraham found out Lot was in
[1:52:40] trouble, he went and got them.
[1:52:44] Come on, church.
[1:52:46] We got young people. We got mas. We got
[1:52:49] daddies. We got people who are hurting.
[1:52:51] We got people that are in trouble. I say
[1:52:53] it's time to get the victory.
[1:52:57] When we know who we are and we are
[1:53:01] persuaded that now we go fight for other
[1:53:04] people.
[1:53:06] Hey, you're talking about a nature
[1:53:08] change now. Now you can go to people
[1:53:11] say, "Hey man, you having a hard time?
[1:53:14] Let me let me tell you my testimony.
[1:53:17] You know what? What God did for me,
[1:53:19] he'll do for you." But you see, when
[1:53:22] you've never experienced it for
[1:53:24] yourself, you can't give it.
[1:53:27] You can't get warm by a painted fire.
[1:53:30] and an intellectual conception of the
[1:53:33] message will never produce the victory.
[1:53:37] It'll become a way of living. But I tell
[1:53:41] you and
[1:53:44] in-n-outs. This message has to be more
[1:53:46] than an explanation. It must be the
[1:53:49] person of Jesus Christ becoming real in
[1:53:52] your life. Five more minutes and I'll
[1:53:54] call for the musicians.
[1:53:56] Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are
[1:53:58] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[1:54:00] sons of God." We're talking about
[1:54:02] leadership by the Holy Ghost. Leadership
[1:54:05] by the word. Now, I I just by the help
[1:54:08] of God, we'll tie all these sermons
[1:54:10] together. I'll wait for all the people
[1:54:12] to get back that just left. I'm just
[1:54:17] kidding. This is like the whole pinnacle
[1:54:19] of my message. And I'm just kidding.
[1:54:24] How did they know to make the valley
[1:54:27] full of ditches?
[1:54:29] How did they know what to do?
[1:54:33] Brother Brandham in other sermons, he
[1:54:35] would actually type that seven-day
[1:54:36] journey to seven church ages.
[1:54:39] They got out the in the wilderness
[1:54:41] through seven church ages without water
[1:54:43] and without the
[1:54:45] spirit. Come on.
[1:54:48] So, how did they know what to
[1:54:53] do? The word of the Lord came to a
[1:55:00] prophet.
[1:55:02] How did they know in the days of
[1:55:06] Noah to build an
[1:55:11] ark? The word of the Lord came to a
[1:55:15] prophet.
[1:55:18] How do we know how to go in a rapture?
[1:55:24] The word of the Lord that came to a
[1:55:26] prophet. How do we know how to dress?
[1:55:32] The word of the Lord that came to a
[1:55:34] prophet. The word of the Lord came to
[1:55:36] Noah. The word of the Lord came to
[1:55:39] Moses. The word of the Lord came to
[1:55:41] Paul. The word of the Lord came to
[1:55:46] Okay. Now, when we preach about how to
[1:55:49] dress, when we preach about sisters not
[1:55:53] cutting their hair, that is not a man's
[1:55:56] opinions. That is God's provided way in
[1:55:58] the end time. You want to know what long
[1:56:01] hair is? Uncut hair. Unbroke hair. You
[1:56:06] clip it, you burn it, you you do
[1:56:08] anything to make it shorter, you are
[1:56:10] transgressing God's word. Now, I want
[1:56:13] you to get on the boat and I'm so glad
[1:56:16] that I wasn't called to preach that
[1:56:17] message. Could you imagine going down
[1:56:19] into the Maricopa Valley and having to
[1:56:21] go down to Home Depot and tell them
[1:56:23] construction guys on the hardwood aisle
[1:56:25] like, "Hey man, we built a big boat in
[1:56:28] Kentucky and the only way out of here,
[1:56:30] man, we all got to go get on it." Sounds
[1:56:33] sounds crazy, but that's the word of the
[1:56:35] Lord. It came to a prophet. That's what
[1:56:37] they had to
[1:56:39] do. But you see, it's the grace of God,
[1:56:43] not rules. You You You cut it, break it,
[1:56:45] do what you want to do. That's your
[1:56:47] nature. It's
[1:56:50] fine. My prophet told me that if you see
[1:56:53] somebody wearing paint or makeup, you
[1:56:54] can call them Miss Dog
[1:56:57] Meat. I'm I'm sorry, young people. I'm
[1:57:00] an oldfashioned.
[1:57:02] Call me what you want to call me, but I
[1:57:04] want you to make it.
[1:57:06] And some of us were fooling
[1:57:09] around. We we we we've sat under
[1:57:12] ministries and we have never gotten
[1:57:13] desperation to understand really what
[1:57:15] the message
[1:57:17] is. And so we just take what we want and
[1:57:19] leave out what we don't
[1:57:22] want. Used to be a shame for sisters to
[1:57:24] do certain things. Now they just do it
[1:57:26] out in the open.
[1:57:28] No shame, just bold and in your face.
[1:57:32] Come and come and act like everything's
[1:57:34] okay and everybody else is like,
[1:57:37] "Wow." But I tell you one thing, don't
[1:57:41] make this message legalism.
[1:57:44] Do not take the grace of God and make it
[1:57:49] disgrace. It's the grace of God. So when
[1:57:52] we see those things, it just lets me
[1:57:53] know they need a nature change. You're
[1:57:56] not fooling me,
[1:58:00] right? You just realize there's more of
[1:58:03] God for them. Now, now I I I hope this
[1:58:06] is okay, but um I I'll just say this,
[1:58:10] but my my wife today was having some
[1:58:12] fellowship and and you know, uh uh she
[1:58:14] she
[1:58:15] she was having some fellowship and
[1:58:18] telling her testimony and and the sister
[1:58:20] was was asking her a question and and my
[1:58:22] my wife used to struggle with clipping
[1:58:24] her hair, you know. She she uh I wasn't
[1:58:27] married. This is before we Okay, this is
[1:58:31] when she was a young person before she
[1:58:33] got the Holy Ghost as God was starting
[1:58:36] to deal with her heart to tr transform
[1:58:38] her and change her. She was wanting more
[1:58:40] of God and she found that she was still
[1:58:41] struggling with things. And the sister
[1:58:43] when she got the victory over it, she
[1:58:45] asked her the question. She goes, "How
[1:58:46] did you
[1:58:47] overcome?" I thought, "My, now there's a
[1:58:50] hungry heart."
[1:58:52] Brother Brandon preached a whole sermon
[1:58:54] called How Can I
[1:58:56] Overcome? And and what I'm trying to uh
[1:58:59] God help me as maybe we've we've slowed
[1:59:02] down here in the end. The word of the
[1:59:04] Lord came to the prophet to tell you how
[1:59:06] to overcome.
[1:59:09] It's not a man's opinion. Let me ask you
[1:59:13] this. Do you want to be pleasing to the
[1:59:14] Lord?
[1:59:18] He sent you Malachi
[1:59:22] 4:5 to let you know what's pleasing to
[1:59:24] the
[1:59:26] Lord. And if you love
[1:59:29] him, then you want to obey the word. And
[1:59:33] if you find out there's a nature and
[1:59:35] something in you that's struggling, then
[1:59:37] you and you have a sincere question, how
[1:59:39] do I overcome? Then we have something to
[1:59:42] work with. But if you're just justifying
[1:59:44] your condition, you you need to die to
[1:59:47] that nature.
[1:59:49] And and we see it many times. People
[1:59:51] will sit in church for years and not
[1:59:53] have a problem doing it. And you just
[1:59:54] sit back. Don't be a hypocrite. And that
[1:59:57] start praying for them. Say, "Lord, I
[1:59:59] see that sister, you know, she's been
[2:00:00] struggling. That brother, he wears a
[2:00:01] shirt so tight his little brother could
[2:00:03] wear it.
[2:00:06] You know, Lord, teach that brother how
[2:00:07] to pull up his pants.
[2:00:09] You know, if they were any tighter,
[2:00:10] they'd be leotards.
[2:00:13] You know, I don't want to see it either.
[2:00:15] You brothers, like, get a bigger pair of
[2:00:18] pants, dude. We don't need to know how
[2:00:20] big your quads are.
[2:00:23] Really? Way to go, muscle
[2:00:26] guy. You work
[2:00:29] out. But do you pray?
[2:00:33] I don't I don't care how much you work
[2:00:34] out and how much you lift. Do you pray?
[2:00:36] That's what you sisters should really
[2:00:38] care about. Who cares how much money
[2:00:40] they make? You don't need the Holy Ghost
[2:00:42] to be a good house. You don't need You
[2:00:44] don't need a career or a degree to to to
[2:00:47] be a good housewife. You need the Holy
[2:00:48] Ghost,
[2:00:50] brothers. You don't need some fantastic
[2:00:51] job and a nice truck. You need the Holy
[2:00:53] Ghost. We're so interested in all the
[2:00:56] worldly things we lead. We left out the
[2:00:58] main thing,
[2:01:00] Christ, the hope of glory.
[2:01:02] We're trying to move towards the word
[2:01:04] revival being made flesh in you. Y'all
[2:01:07] ready for the home stretch? Cuz we got
[2:01:08] to get through some material real quick.
[2:01:11] All right, let's go. Let's Let's make
[2:01:13] the home stretch. Let's close this thing
[2:01:15] out. How did they know to make the
[2:01:16] valley full of ditches? The word of the
[2:01:18] Lord came to a prophet. Look, Malachi
[2:01:22] 4:5 is the grace of God to you. It's the
[2:01:25] word of the Lord coming to you to tell
[2:01:27] you how to overcome, how to dress, how
[2:01:30] to act right. He's telling you how to go
[2:01:33] in a rapture. And if you want to miss
[2:01:35] the tribulation, you better start
[2:01:38] digging. You better start getting
[2:01:40] everything out of the way. And if you do
[2:01:42] your part, I tell you, there's coming a
[2:01:44] gusher. God will fill your heart so much
[2:01:46] with the Holy Ghost, you'll be a house
[2:01:48] on fire on a windy day. Hallelujah.
[2:01:51] You'll have a nature
[2:01:53] change. You know what you'll do? You'll
[2:01:56] go start digging ditches for other
[2:01:58] people. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I feel
[2:02:02] pretty good. I got my ditches all dug
[2:02:04] out of the way. I'm going to go help my
[2:02:05] brother dig. Let me go work for my
[2:02:07] brother. You went off. I'm coming after
[2:02:10] you. I got the Holy Ghost. I got the
[2:02:13] victory. I'm going to go get it for
[2:02:14] somebody else. Now we're living for
[2:02:16] others. Eternal life is living for
[2:02:19] others. It's time to go on the
[2:02:23] offensive. No more backing up. Onward
[2:02:26] Christian
[2:02:29] soldiers. You must be born again. The
[2:02:31] prophet of God says, "Oh, I'll just
[2:02:33] invite the musicians, but I'll tell you
[2:02:35] when to start playing.
[2:02:40] Thank you. I appreciate
[2:02:43] that. I've gotten the musicians up at
[2:02:46] the home church. I I'm trying to do
[2:02:48] better. Leave them sitting there for
[2:02:50] like 15, 20 minutes. I'm trying to
[2:02:54] close. Prophet of God says,
[2:02:57] "Hallelujah." But the true word comes to
[2:02:59] the true prophet and he tells you the
[2:03:02] true word.
[2:03:05] I almost want to have a jubilee right
[2:03:07] now. Brother Ron, what got you out of
[2:03:09] San Diego? The
[2:03:13] message. You think it's any different,
[2:03:15] young people? The same word Brother Ron
[2:03:17] had to hear, you got to hear.
[2:03:20] But far be it for me to leave it to some
[2:03:22] intellectual conception. I want a God
[2:03:25] that can come transform a man's life and
[2:03:27] pull him out of everything he ever knew
[2:03:29] and make him move to a
[2:03:31] valley. Now, we're talking about a Holy
[2:03:34] Ghost. Now we're talking about a real
[2:03:36] gospel. Look, I I don't like to tell it,
[2:03:39] but I was so stooped in sin. I was doing
[2:03:41] drugs and and doing all kind of
[2:03:43] nonsense. I was selling it. I was
[2:03:45] dealing it. I was so far out in the
[2:03:47] world. I was so far gone. But one day, I
[2:03:50] said, "God, whatever this is, it's
[2:03:53] bigger than me, and I need your help."
[2:03:55] And the same God that met brother Ron,
[2:03:57] the same God that met my daddy, the same
[2:04:00] God that met brother Brandham, the same
[2:04:02] God, hallelujah, came and he met me and
[2:04:06] changed my nature. Hallelujah. And that
[2:04:09] same God is here tonight to change
[2:04:12] you. Get ready. There's coming a gusher.
[2:04:16] Get ready for the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:24] The true word comes to the prophet. He
[2:04:26] tells you the true word. You follow that
[2:04:28] true word and you get a true word
[2:04:30] experience of the word because the word
[2:04:33] is made flesh in you and you become
[2:04:37] God's son. And the word of God is
[2:04:40] revolving right out of God, right out of
[2:04:42] God into you because you are his nature.
[2:04:47] His spirit is in you and you'll do the
[2:04:51] works of God. Hallelujah. The Bible said
[2:04:53] so. Oh, isn't that
[2:04:56] wonderful? I have to stop, but I'm right
[2:04:59] to our text where I really wanted to
[2:05:01] take off.
[2:05:03] I
[2:05:04] will. Sorry,
[2:05:07] musicians. Hey, let's let's get the
[2:05:09] victory.
[2:05:11] All right. Paul said in, "Hey, I'm
[2:05:13] feeling really good." He said, 'I find
[2:05:16] in a lawin. We we we we finished here
[2:05:18] and I want to continue. God, y'all pray
[2:05:20] for her. Let's just pray to to bring
[2:05:22] this to a place that'll bring forth
[2:05:23] births and transformations and fillings
[2:05:25] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Go. I I really
[2:05:27] feel God's uh pressing in right now.
[2:05:30] Just be real
[2:05:32] reverent. Paul says this, "I find then a
[2:05:38] law, law of God after the inward man,
[2:05:41] but I see another law in my members
[2:05:43] waring against the law of my mind and
[2:05:45] bringing me in captivity to the law of
[2:05:48] sin which is in my in my
[2:05:53] members. Oh wretched man that I
[2:05:56] am, who shall deliver me from the body
[2:06:00] of this death?
[2:06:04] What a
[2:06:06] question. Maybe you should just ask that
[2:06:09] question. Oh, wretched man that I
[2:06:12] am. Who shall deliver me from the body
[2:06:15] of this death? I thank
[2:06:18] God through Jesus Christ our
[2:06:21] Lord. That with my
[2:06:24] mind I myself serve the law of
[2:06:27] God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:35] Prophet of God said, "It's a time that
[2:06:37] we should never let the spirit of
[2:06:39] revival
[2:06:44] die." One time there were some men. They
[2:06:46] heard about the Welsh
[2:06:49] revival. There were some good men from
[2:06:51] our country and they wanted to go see
[2:06:53] about
[2:06:54] it. So they all got together and wanted
[2:06:56] to go see what this power of God was.
[2:06:58] And
[2:07:01] They got over there looking around and
[2:07:03] they seen this happy little officer over
[2:07:05] there just working with joy in his
[2:07:08] heart. They come up to him and said,
[2:07:10] "Excuse me,
[2:07:12] sir. Can you tell me where the Welsh
[2:07:15] Revival
[2:07:16] is?" He perked up and said, "I'm
[2:07:22] it. You're looking at it.
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:30] You want to know where the bride's
[2:07:31] revival
[2:07:33] is? It's not an intellectual revival.
[2:07:36] It's it's a word
[2:07:37] revival. You want to know where it
[2:07:40] is? I'm
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:44] it. I am the proof of the
[2:07:48] message. I'm the proof of Malachi 4:5.
[2:07:53] Behold, I send
[2:07:54] you
[2:07:56] me. You sent me your grace,
[2:07:59] Lord. You did that for me. Behold, I
[2:08:03] send
[2:08:04] you. You are the proof of his
[2:08:07] resurrection. You are the proof that
[2:08:09] he'll have a bride in the last days
[2:08:12] that'll come away from the
[2:08:14] denominational and the nonsense of the
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:17] world. I am the message.
[2:08:23] I'm the revival.
[2:08:26] You
[2:08:27] mean You mean the third pull in the
[2:08:30] opening of the word has to take on
[2:08:32] flesh?
[2:08:34] Yeah. Yeah. He That's why you're here,
[2:08:36] brother. Sister, that's why you're here.
[2:08:40] God, before he even formed this world,
[2:08:42] he said, "You know
[2:08:44] what? I want that one here. I want that
[2:08:47] one here." And a matter of
[2:08:50] fact, there's going to come a
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:55] day May 31st on a Saturday
[2:08:59] night up in the mountains of Arizona,
[2:09:03] not far from where the king's horde's
[2:09:06] going to drop down in my servant's hand
[2:09:07] and tell them who they
[2:09:09] are. They're going to get be gathered up
[2:09:11] there and one of them's going to catch
[2:09:13] the
[2:09:14] revelation that I'm the
[2:09:16] bride. I am the
[2:09:20] message. And
[2:09:22] oh, there is a law that wars within my
[2:09:27] members. But
[2:09:29] oh, I've heard a
[2:09:31] shout. I've heard a message that I thank
[2:09:35] God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So
[2:09:37] when with the mind I serve the the law
[2:09:40] of God, but with the flesh the law of
[2:09:42] sin. So I'm just going to die to that
[2:09:44] thing with every head bowed.
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:52] Many times when we think of a
[2:09:55] revival, you might think of a camp
[2:09:57] meeting or special
[2:10:00] services. We've been blessed to be here.
[2:10:04] But when the camp is
[2:10:05] over and everybody's gone
[2:10:08] home, the lights have been shut
[2:10:12] out, I want to ask you, where is the
[2:10:14] revival then?
[2:10:19] Prophet of God said, "And how can I
[2:10:21] overcome?" This is the time we should
[2:10:24] never let the spirit of revival
[2:10:26] die. We got to constantly stay in
[2:10:30] revival. As Paul said, I die
[2:10:36] daily. I just feel in my heart the
[2:10:39] presence of God is real near.
[2:10:42] I feel this morning we could have had an
[2:10:44] altar
[2:10:45] call. God was letting you know, look,
[2:10:48] I've moved everything out of the
[2:10:49] [Music]
[2:10:51] way. I've made a way for
[2:10:54] you. Just go ahead and step into it. Is
[2:10:58] there somebody here that wants to just
[2:10:59] go ahead and step into it? You know
[2:11:01] what? I'm going to I'm going to cross
[2:11:03] over. Is there somebody here? You just
[2:11:05] feel like, you know what? This will be
[2:11:07] my chance. This will be my opportunity.
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:17] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:30] Saturate my my thirsty soul. Oh, come
[2:11:36] and fall aresh on me.
[2:11:39] Oh, fill my cup again.
[2:11:46] Heal my heart, oh, and make me whole.
[2:11:55] I
[2:11:56] need you
[2:11:58] now. Pour your
[2:12:01] spirit out.
[2:12:04] Hallelujah. Oh, pour your spirit out on
[2:12:10] me. Fall just like the rain.
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:18] Saturate my
[2:12:20] thirsty
[2:12:22] soul. Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:12:27] Oh, fill my cup again.
[2:12:34] Heal my heart, oh, and make me
[2:12:41] whole. Oh, I
[2:12:43] need you
[2:12:46] now. Pour your
[2:12:48] spirit out.
[2:12:52] You got the ditches
[2:12:54] dug. You got everything out of the
[2:12:57] way. Why don't you let him deal with
[2:12:59] your heart?
[2:13:04] We don't need to beg you
[2:13:06] or press upon you,
[2:13:09] but somebody here wants to press
[2:13:12] in. Just make everything
[2:13:18] right. If you've made ready, why don't
[2:13:20] you just invite him to where you're at?
[2:13:23] If you feel like you want to come to an
[2:13:25] altar, if you want to slip out and
[2:13:28] pray, I just want you to know Jesus
[2:13:30] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13:33] forever. I want you to know that it's
[2:13:35] Christ in you, the hope of
[2:13:38] glory. But just as
[2:13:40] we
[2:13:41] read, the anointing is Christ coming to
[2:13:44] you, anointing the word and making it
[2:13:46] live.
[2:13:48] you can have an understanding and you
[2:13:49] can believe all these things and but if
[2:13:52] you're not seeing the fruits in your
[2:13:53] life then you have to come to a place
[2:13:56] and just be honest with yourself and say
[2:13:58] Lord I I don't have what I thought I
[2:14:02] had and I I I really want to be
[2:14:06] changed and I really want victory and
[2:14:09] maybe God's done a great work in your
[2:14:10] life and you've been struggling with
[2:14:12] something and you need a little help.
[2:14:13] It's okay to need help.
[2:14:17] We all needed
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:20] help. I needed
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:24] help. And he came to me and I just want
[2:14:27] him to come to you right now.
[2:14:32] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:14:37] Fall just like the rain.
[2:14:41] Hallelujah.
[2:14:44] Saturate my
[2:14:47] thirsty
[2:14:48] soul. Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:14:55] Fill my cup again.
[2:15:00] Heal my
[2:15:02] heart and make me whole.
[2:15:09] I
[2:15:10] need you
[2:15:12] now. Pour your spirit. Oh, that's
[2:15:15] wonderful. Just keep praising her now.
[2:15:17] That's a spirit coming to you now. Pour
[2:15:20] your spirit out on
[2:15:23] me. Oh, fall.
[2:15:27] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:15:29] [Music]

[2:15:34] tonight?
[2:15:36] This is my night. Come and fall aresh on
[2:15:39] me. This is my time,
