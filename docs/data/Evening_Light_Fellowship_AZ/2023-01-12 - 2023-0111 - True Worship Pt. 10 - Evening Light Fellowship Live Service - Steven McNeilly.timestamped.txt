[11:15] second come on up because brother Johnny
[11:17] has been in charge he's you have a go-to
[11:19] guy when we have ordered fiber optics to
[11:24] be brought to the church and if you know
[11:26] anything about the technical and of
[11:30] fiber versus regular hardwire for
[11:34] streaming fiber optics is like a
[11:37] flamethrower man it's like a fire
[11:39] hydrant brother Johnny is our go-to guy
[11:42] we've been working on this for months
[11:44] brother Johnny come give us an update on
[11:46] where we're at on that
[11:48] it's going to be great
[11:52] there's a box right out front that they
[11:54] installed a couple months ago that will
[11:56] serve 14 000 customers
[11:58] the fiber optic system is so much more
[12:01] advanced than cable system and we are so
[12:05] looking forward to faster speeds for our
[12:08] archiving and for our streaming services
[12:11] and Wi-Fi everything it's just going to
[12:16] be awesome and we just can't wait to get
[12:18] it hopefully
[12:20] by the end of the week or maybe into
[12:22] next week it'll be completed they've
[12:25] been using boring and that's my
[12:27] Landscaping out there by the way and
[12:30] I've been watching over that
[12:31] and they mess it up one time they said
[12:34] they wouldn't do it again but anyway
[12:36] uh I I really appreciate working with
[12:39] them guys they're very very nice and
[12:41] I've already invited several to church
[12:43] given out some books
[12:45] and can't help it but it's going to be
[12:49] great and I'm really looking forward to
[12:50] it and if anybody has any questions you
[12:52] can always text me or call me and we'll
[12:54] try to get this soon as possible
[12:57] thank you very much
[13:00] yes sister Carolyn was asking me she was
[13:02] at she works in the front desk there and
[13:05] they have the
[13:07] technology that they go ahead and some
[13:09] people uh still require to get a CD or
[13:14] whatever because they can't stream or
[13:16] whatever would and she said brother Ron
[13:18] we just can't do it like we used to now
[13:21] some of you what happened is our
[13:24] bandwidth now this is my terminology the
[13:27] bandwidth became so diluted because so
[13:32] many of you had the password and the
[13:34] Wi-Fi capability that you could get on
[13:38] your cell phone and we had people that
[13:40] even during service are texting and
[13:44] checking and on the Internet or whatever
[13:46] and I hope that our deacons if they
[13:48] catch you they confiscate your phone
[13:50] give it back to you after service but I
[13:53] am appealing to your heart first and say
[13:55] hey don't do that during service so what
[13:57] they did is they went ahead and they
[13:59] gave it only to a small group of people
[14:02] that needed
[14:04] for to help with our we're streaming now
[14:08] this last service this last service four
[14:11] or five times we had streaming
[14:14] difficulty I don't know why
[14:16] we could have them come up here and give
[14:18] you the whys and where floors of it but
[14:20] I don't know now we are aware that there
[14:22] are streaming difficulties
[14:25] um and I don't know if you've ever been
[14:27] out of town and you tried to stream in
[14:30] and the thing buffers and you it keeps
[14:33] losing signal to me that's totally
[14:36] frustrating and that's that's not
[14:38] acceptable period I see little small
[14:41] much smaller churches than us and you
[14:44] get on theirs and boy it just streams is
[14:46] good good picture it works well so I'm
[14:49] I'm appealing to my technical team fix
[14:52] it
[14:53] no more excuses especially when we get
[14:56] this uh is it our computers
[15:00] is it our systems
[15:02] if we're in if we've got the technology
[15:05] way back that's old let's fix it
[15:08] that's all I want to give you all the
[15:11] best possibility of the best product
[15:14] that we possibly can get so the first
[15:18] thing is is to bring in the fiber optic
[15:21] and Monday about eight or nine o'clock
[15:24] Johnny was over here and got with the
[15:26] technicians that are boring
[15:30] out there and bringing it into and it's
[15:32] going to be in our technical room here
[15:34] right near the men's restroom over here
[15:37] in women's restroom right here on the
[15:38] corner and he went in there and they
[15:40] they know now where they're going to put
[15:42] their boxes
[15:43] he's our go-to guy once they say we're
[15:46] ready to bring it into your church he's
[15:49] our go-to guy he'll come over unlock
[15:51] bring him in there they'll set it up and
[15:53] then brother yes and all of the
[15:56] technical team who do the the the
[15:59] streaming and the archiving and all of
[16:02] that then they will go ahead and do
[16:03] their work and it may take a week or two
[16:06] to get everything back up and the way
[16:09] that it should be so uh we will uh we
[16:14] will be patient
[16:16] as we possibly can be
[16:19] to have that repaired and fixed as soon
[16:22] as possible
[16:24] um
[16:25] so uh I wanted to introduce too we have
[16:29] uh brother John and sister Roseanne

[17:58] on
[18:00] brother uh Billy Silva
[18:04] brother Billy Silva
[18:07] uh
[18:09] let me find this here
[18:12] uh
[18:15] brother Ernesto went ahead now what
[18:18] happened is and let me just tell you
[18:21] kind of how this evolved brother Billy
[18:25] took a couple Brothers over the Border
[18:27] they were just visiting they said hey
[18:29] I'm going to take you guys for some real
[18:31] Mexican tacos
[18:34] so they crossed Nogales there at the
[18:37] border and he forgotten he had a nine
[18:41] millimeter pistol in his glove box
[18:44] and they found it guess what all three
[18:46] got in trouble they got put in jail and
[18:49] that was in about mid-December and now I
[18:53] did call Brother Abel Silva and brother
[18:56] Abel Silva
[18:58] um he told me he said brother Ron I've
[19:00] talked to my son I was there there's
[19:03] nothing we can do there's nothing you
[19:05] tell the church he repeated it twice
[19:08] there's nothing you can do to get him
[19:11] out of there
[19:12] and he said just pray
[19:14] well I'm one of these guys it's kind of
[19:16] like the two guys in the boat they're
[19:17] out fishing offshore in their little row
[19:19] boat storms coming up one brother looks
[19:22] oh there's a storm coming let's pray and
[19:25] have the storm go around us so we can
[19:26] continue fishing the other brother says
[19:29] well I'll tell you what you start
[19:31] praying and I'll start rowing
[19:33] I feel the same way I there are things
[19:36] in me as an example and I told her
[19:39] brethren in the back room Jesus was
[19:41] crucified
[19:43] and nobody asked for the body of Jesus
[19:46] so he could be prepared and put into a
[19:48] grave who was it you remember
[19:51] Joseph of armathea
[19:53] thank God for Joseph because he was a
[19:55] man of wealth and he went before the
[19:57] government hey will you release the body
[20:01] so we can prepare it for the Sabbath and
[20:03] so he went and guess what he placed him
[20:06] in his own tomb it was a borrowed tomb
[20:09] he wasn't going to need it but for three
[20:12] days
[20:14] but what I'm saying saints of God now
[20:17] the Lord dealt with me at three o'clock
[20:19] here just a week or so ago
[20:22] and at three in the morning it just come
[20:25] to me I was wide awake and the Holy
[20:28] Spirit is saying what are you doing with
[20:30] those that are in prison
[20:31] an immediate thought of brother Billy
[20:33] and
[20:35] I hung my head and I said nothing
[20:38] because I did speak to with brother Abel
[20:40] and
[20:41] uh he said there's nothing you can do
[20:43] just pray
[20:45] well I didn't feel that that's enough
[20:47] and I thought I it was impressed on me
[20:50] that we need to do something
[20:52] and I'm the type person that even if
[20:55] somebody tells no I'm going to exhaust
[20:57] all my resources because if it was you
[21:00] I don't care which one of you if it was
[21:03] you in prison we're not going to sit
[21:05] here as a body and just say well let's
[21:07] pray for him Lord bless him Lord feed
[21:10] him Lord give him warmth Lord you see
[21:12] I'm saying no somebody somebody go and
[21:16] seek from The Authority so years ago I
[21:20] went to a brother down I preached
[21:21] several conventions down in Mexico and
[21:24] he worked for the governor down there
[21:26] and he knows men in high positions he
[21:28] said brother Ron you keep this card it
[21:31] was a little business card of the
[21:33] governor of that province in Mexico this
[21:37] is a get out of jail for free card you
[21:40] keep this and if you get in trouble in
[21:42] any way you call
[21:45] well I kept it for years how often do I
[21:47] go to Mexico very little and it's one of
[21:49] those cards that finally starts wearing
[21:50] out and you look in your well now I
[21:53] tossed it but I knew who gave it to me
[21:55] and it was a brother down there in
[21:57] Mexico I called him I said and he said
[21:59] brother Ron yes yes I'll get right on it
[22:02] within 15 minutes he had a lawyer
[22:04] already contacted
[22:07] see people in position
[22:09] they know people it's not what you know
[22:13] it's who you know

[24:14] uh they have also made contact with the
[24:16] lawyer of that place and we hope to make
[24:19] some appeals so that everything goes
[24:21] smoothly we trust God is handling of our
[24:25] friend in the government God bless you
[24:27] uh thank you for your prayers and
[24:30] praying for him if there's something
[24:32] else I will keep you informed amen
[24:35] um
[24:36] okay brother Austin Johnson come up here
[24:39] because it was on his heart okay uh he
[24:42] said brother Ron can because Brother
[24:44] David Rutledge and different ones
[24:45] brother Ron can we can we give some
[24:47] money let's take up an offering and well
[24:50] you don't just take money and throw it
[24:51] something you want to know how much is
[24:53] it what are we looking at and come on up
[24:56] here Austin
[24:57] and uh uh so uh somebody said well what
[25:01] about a GoFundMe page would you tell us
[25:03] about a GoFundMe page here I don't know
[25:05] if that's high enough that works it
[25:07] works uh God bless you Saints so
[25:11] um brother Amos reached out to me
[25:13] because brother
[25:14] yeah that works better
[25:16] um brother Amos had reached out to me
[25:18] when I was in Atlanta with my mom and
[25:21] when I was flying back
[25:23] um about setting up a GoFundMe
[25:26] basically it's it's fairly simple
[25:30] um it's it's just a page explaining the
[25:32] situation and everything and it's got
[25:34] links and whatnot so for example
[25:37] a lot of you have social media
[25:39] Instagrams you have friends and you know
[25:42] people you know there's a lot of we
[25:44] could probably get probably easily over
[25:47] ten thousand people to see the link if
[25:49] we just shared it with the people in the
[25:51] church and basically if someone feels it
[25:54] on their heart
[25:55] if a thousand people gave five bucks
[25:58] that's five grand
[26:00] so in assuming like if we don't need the
[26:03] money we can refund it through GoFundMe
[26:06] it's pretty easy
[26:08] um so yeah uh brother Amos had asked me
[26:11] to set that up so it is ready to go just
[26:12] whenever brother Ron wants to use it
[26:16] um also make sure I'm not managing the
[26:18] funds we'll have an elder to it so yeah
[26:21] but that's that's the basics so it's
[26:23] ready to go just whenever we need to use
[26:25] it
[26:26] it's already up
[26:28] whenever you want it
[26:29] uh no I was gonna talk to yes about
[26:32] getting it set up on our church website
[26:34] and whatnot we'll connect with that
[26:38] yeah
[26:39] uh both that's fine that's fine and
[26:42] quite honestly I'll probably put it when
[26:45] ever you want I'll just put it in the
[26:47] senior use chat because like everybody
[26:48] in their hustle should be so you guys
[26:50] can link it out to your friends and
[26:52] whatever and that's fine yeah
[27:00] praise the Lord so some of you are
[27:02] asking what can we do uh we will have uh
[27:05] get it out there to you
[27:07] um this GoFundMe page there and uh
[27:10] listen we don't know at this time how
[27:13] much the The Mexican government is going
[27:16] to ask
[27:18] we've asked essentially they said
[27:20] between 20 and 30 000 to try to expedite
[27:24] to get him out we don't know now we're
[27:27] praying that hey God give us yes Sandy
[27:38] yeah yeah there there's you see
[27:43] do you see they say the faster you get
[27:46] this thing done the better off you are
[27:47] because the longer you stay in jail down
[27:49] there let me give you an example if it
[27:51] would have been a 45 caliber pistol and
[27:54] not a nine millimeter it's a minimum of
[27:57] 15 years mandatory jail sentence because
[28:00] that's what the drug cartel now he's
[28:03] being used right now as a political Pawn
[28:05] because right now the borders are closed
[28:07] in New Mexico because guess what El
[28:10] Chapo's son just got arrested and and
[28:13] they're killing people it's on your news
[28:16] right so here's a political pawn and and
[28:20] it's right at the time if this would
[28:21] have happened several months ago he'd
[28:23] got a slap on a hand a fine of a couple
[28:25] thousand dollars uh confiscate the gun
[28:28] turn around tell him okay your
[28:29] blacklisted can't come to Mexico again
[28:31] something like that so what I'm saying
[28:34] is that's giving you all of an idea of
[28:37] where we're at and if it was you
[28:41] if it was you believe me
[28:44] I want to do everything I can for my
[28:46] sheep to just say uh hey I am not going
[28:49] to take no for an answer and I'm going
[28:51] to knock on all doors and once I have
[28:54] exhausted all options
[28:56] yes of course I believe in praying the
[28:59] whole time
[29:01] but I do believe that we too as a body
[29:03] of Christ can do something it's maybe
[29:05] knowing somebody and if this lawyer
[29:07] comes in and she's already said uh I've
[29:10] found where they've they have broken the
[29:12] law he's an American citizen
[29:15] etc etc and he should be out and
[29:17] whatever but I was told by uh brother
[29:20] Abel Silva he's doing well
[29:22] he is in a newer prison uh he gets three
[29:26] good meals a day he has he's able to
[29:29] work out an hour a day and to take a
[29:32] shower every day so uh praise the Lord
[29:35] for that hey uh because the horror
[29:38] stories I have heard of some of the
[29:40] places down in Mexico that you could be
[29:42] held
[29:44] um
[29:44] so anyway we will continue to pray I'm
[29:47] going to keep you guys up updated uh as
[29:51] we know okay now let's all uh Stan I'm
[29:54] going to turn it over to uh brother Mark

[43:15] your Bibles turn with me to the book of
[43:17] Colossians Colossians chapter 3 will
[43:21] read verses 12 through 15. thank you
[43:24] musicians
[43:26] Colossians chapter 3
[43:30] verses 12 through 15 we greet you all
[43:33] this evening in the lovely name of Jesus
[43:35] Christ and it's always good to be
[43:37] gathered together in his presence amen
[43:40] the Bible says in verse 12 put on
[43:43] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[43:47] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[43:51] humbleness of Mind meekness
[43:53] long-suffering notice he's talking to
[43:55] somebody right now
[43:56] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[43:59] another If any man have a quarrel
[44:01] against any even as Christ forgive you
[44:04] so also do ye and above all these things
[44:07] put on charity which is the bond of
[44:10] perfectness and let the peace of God
[44:12] rule in your hearts to the which also
[44:15] year called in one body and be ye
[44:19] thankful
[44:20] amen second Timothy chapter 3
[44:24] we'll read verses one through five
[44:29] notice there he was speaking to the
[44:31] elect of God the holy and beloved and he
[44:35] goes through all these things then he
[44:36] says be thankful
[44:38] amen second Timothy 3 1-5 this know also
[44:43] that in the last days perilous times
[44:45] shall come
[44:46] for man shall be lovers of their own
[44:48] selves Covetous boasters proud
[44:52] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[44:56] unthankful
[44:59] Unholy without natural affection truth
[45:02] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[45:05] Fierce despisers despisers of those that
[45:09] are good traitors heady high-minded
[45:11] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[45:14] God having a form of godliness but
[45:17] denying the power thereof from such turn
[45:21] away amen you may be seated this evening
[45:23] in the presence of the Lord
[45:28] it struck me quite well when I read you
[45:31] know in perilous times and perilous
[45:34] times shall come and I can say behold we
[45:37] are in the midst of perilous times but
[45:39] in the amongst of these uh evil doers if
[45:43] you want to put it like that the Bible
[45:45] says that they're unthankful
[45:48] so we see here that God is is
[45:51] distinguishing a difference between
[45:53] being thankful and being unthankful that
[45:57] the elect of God the holy and the
[45:59] Beloved of the Lord the he's telling
[46:02] them to be thankful because the people
[46:04] on the opposite end of the spectrum are
[46:07] unthankful now let me ask you a question
[46:09] tonight are you thankful or are you
[46:12] unthankful
[46:15] I'd like to title my sermon this evening
[46:17] true worship part 10 and uh with the
[46:21] subject of an attitude of gratitude and
[46:23] this is part two
[46:25] now in our opening scripture we can see
[46:28] the expectations out of the word of God
[46:31] that of what God is wanting out of us as
[46:34] the Bride of Jesus Christ as the elect
[46:36] of God and how we are to live our lives
[46:40] uh it's sad for us to to be
[46:42] long-suffering and to be gentle and and
[46:45] all these different things to have
[46:47] charity amongst each other to forgive
[46:49] one another and this isn't just uh some
[46:53] kind of uh I hope for you to be like
[46:56] this uh no it's a commandment of God
[46:59] that if you call yourself the elect of
[47:01] God
[47:02] predestinated before the foundations of
[47:05] the world he's laying out a a blueprint
[47:08] here and how he wants us to live our
[47:10] lives as believers
[47:12] and so we find out that this life that
[47:14] we are called to live is a supernatural
[47:18] life
[47:19] this scripture and other scriptures like
[47:22] this that is speaking to the bride of
[47:24] Christ it can only be lived through a
[47:27] supernatural Life by a supernatural
[47:30] experience by the word birth
[47:33] amen outside of the word birth outside
[47:37] of a supernatural experience with God
[47:41] himself there is no way in this lifetime
[47:44] that we could ever live to the standard
[47:46] of the scriptures but by a new birth
[47:49] experience by the baptism of the Holy
[47:52] Ghost guess what we are more than
[47:53] Overcomers why because now the life of
[47:56] God Lives within the believer
[47:59] and it's no longer I the carnal man that
[48:01] lived but it's Christ who's living
[48:04] through me what is it it's the anointed
[48:06] word
[48:08] that's cool
[48:09] so we find in comparison here the life
[48:12] of the unbeliever
[48:13] and what it would look like in these end
[48:16] times
[48:17] what is it that makes these that makes
[48:20] these end times so perilous
[48:24] behold perilous times shall come so what
[48:27] is it in this end time that we're living
[48:29] in that makes it so perilous and so
[48:32] dangerous in this world that we are in
[48:35] it's the life of the unbeliever
[48:39] notice that because it said for men uh
[48:43] shall be lovers of their own selves
[48:44] they'll be Covetous boasters proud
[48:46] they'll be blasphemers this is all part
[48:48] of the perilous times that is to come in
[48:53] this end time
[48:54] and let me say this it's not coming in
[48:58] the end time it's already here
[49:01] we are living in the midst of the most
[49:04] perilous evil time that has ever been on
[49:08] the face of the planet
[49:10] why is it because there's men of that
[49:14] have never been regenerated
[49:16] who have never had an experience with
[49:18] God are just living their lives and
[49:20] they're proud and they're boasters and
[49:22] they're men Slayers they're adulterers
[49:24] they're fornicators whatever it may be
[49:28] that's what's causing the perilous times
[49:30] to come in in where we're living right
[49:33] now
[49:34] so the scripture when it was once
[49:36] written was a prophecy behold perilous
[49:39] times shall come at the end time
[49:42] let me say that this day this scripture
[49:45] is being fulfilled right in the midst of
[49:49] loudius ear right amongst us and where
[49:51] we're living at right now perilous times
[49:53] is not coming but perilous times is here
[49:57] but thank God in the midst of perilous
[50:00] times that we have an advocate before
[50:03] the father that we have somebody that we
[50:06] can turn to
[50:08] a protector someone to watch over us
[50:13] an ear that we can vent our issues to
[50:17] because his arm is not too short
[50:21] Hallelujah nor is he a deaf God but he
[50:24] hears the cries of his people
[50:29] we are living in the days as it was in
[50:32] the days of Noah
[50:33] were the conditions of man's heart was
[50:36] continuously evil we are living in the
[50:39] midst of Sodom and Gomorrah where the
[50:42] man burned within themselves for one
[50:44] another
[50:45] and not only that but they were proud
[50:48] and they weren't ashamed about it
[50:51] notice when the two angels went into
[50:53] lot's house to bring him out of Sodom
[50:55] and the man of the city that surrounded
[50:58] the house it wasn't just one man in
[51:00] secret but the whole city the man of the
[51:03] city and camped around about the house
[51:06] let us in let us in we're the men that
[51:10] came into your house this evening
[51:12] and here he was he was a lot he says I
[51:14] uh do the man no harm here's my
[51:17] daughters they've known no man and and
[51:19] here take my daughters instead
[51:22] but they weren't ashamed of the way that
[51:25] they were living their lives we don't
[51:28] want the women
[51:31] but this is what we want why did they
[51:33] want it because their hearts was turned
[51:36] over
[51:37] that they would believe a lie
[51:40] so not only
[51:42] this is not only were they of that way
[51:45] of thinking but they were proud of it
[51:48] and they were not ashamed of it
[51:51] put yourself
[51:53] look at the world around us
[51:59] I went there the other day and uh uh we
[52:03] we got a puppy for the kids for
[52:06] Christmas and uh so I went to Denver and
[52:10] got the little puppy or whatever and was
[52:12] coming back and a long day okay and uh I
[52:17] don't know about any of you guys have
[52:19] you ever driven in Colorado at about 5
[52:22] 30 in the snow and it's getting foggy
[52:25] and you know what I did
[52:28] my my cell phone kept taking me off the
[52:31] freeway and I knew I'm like if I just
[52:33] stay on the freeway I'll get back into
[52:34] Denver
[52:35] but I wanted to stay with my GPS so I
[52:39] stayed with the GPS and it's taken me
[52:40] all these back roads I'm thinking and
[52:42] Ashland calls me
[52:44] because you have that track my iPhone I
[52:46] can't do anything I can't go anywhere I
[52:49] can't spend any money Ashland knows it
[52:51] all
[52:54] laughs
[52:55] and so she's like where in the world are
[52:58] you I said I don't know she goes you're
[53:00] in the middle of nowhere I know
[53:05] you talk about a young man praying
[53:08] sincerely for the fog to lift
[53:11] so anyways we made it back praise the
[53:14] Lord and now I'm getting as I'm going
[53:16] somewhere with this and so we get off
[53:19] the plane and um have any of you ever
[53:21] traveled with a puppy
[53:23] and and and if you ever a puppy outside
[53:26] of a little baby is the only thing that
[53:28] I've ever heard a grown man go oh
[53:32] what a cute puppy
[53:36] so anyways get off the plane and uh you
[53:40] know how there's always people waiting
[53:42] it's like two in the morning there's
[53:43] people waiting and um
[53:46] you know they're all happy and
[53:48] everything and and their their friends
[53:50] are coming out and they're there to meet
[53:52] them and greet them well there was there
[53:55] was two people of the city of Sodom and
[53:57] Gomorrah you understand what I'm saying
[54:01] and so here they were and they were so
[54:04] happy to see each other
[54:07] and here they were and I looked and I'll
[54:10] say it as as brother Branham would said
[54:12] they were slopping and they were kissing
[54:15] and making all kinds of noise in the
[54:17] middle of the airport
[54:19] and I look and I think my is it can't be
[54:23] and I look again and sure enough two
[54:26] people of Sodom and Gomorrah to Men of
[54:28] the city and it was absolutely
[54:31] gut-wrenching it made me sick
[54:37] what was even sicker was there was
[54:39] another lady that was waiting for a
[54:41] friend of hers to get off the plane and
[54:44] she was there and she was watching and
[54:46] she goes oh
[54:48] and I could tell that she was happy that
[54:50] these two had reunited and she was happy
[54:54] to see how happy they were to see each
[54:56] other
[55:01] it used to be
[55:03] that whenever two people of the same sex
[55:06] liked each other they were ashamed
[55:11] there's no way two men and two women
[55:13] would hold hands walking down the street
[55:17] why because there was some kind of
[55:19] conviction in the air there was some
[55:22] kind of uh of Shame and Society even
[55:25] five six years ago where it wasn't
[55:28] accepted but now look at where we're at
[55:32] now it's being pushed onto our children
[55:35] now it's being pushed into the schools
[55:37] so that everybody can accept that that
[55:39] is just normal
[55:41] it's not normal
[55:42] it's disgusting in the eyes of God
[55:48] not only are they gay but they're proud
[55:51] they want to rub it in your face and let
[55:54] everybody know because there's no shame
[55:55] about it anymore
[55:57] I say Lord Jesus come quickly
[56:05] there's a little boy that goes to my
[56:06] daughter's school
[56:08] and this little boy all of a sudden now
[56:12] wants to be a little girl
[56:15] so what this little boy does when he's
[56:17] 10 years old we see it in the headlines
[56:20] we see it in the News transgender and we
[56:23] see all these different things but when
[56:25] it comes down to where you're living at
[56:27] it's a different story
[56:32] and this little boy's dressing like a
[56:33] little girl
[56:35] little mini skirt letting his hair grow
[56:37] out
[56:39] so now as a father watch this
[56:42] as a father now and my children Mariah
[56:45] is the oldest she's eight years old and
[56:48] miles is in kindergarten he's six now
[56:50] we're having to explain to our little
[56:54] children our little innocent children
[56:57] why it's not okay
[56:59] for those things to be
[57:01] why it's not okay for the for for a kid
[57:05] to have a daddy and a daddy and a mommy
[57:07] and a mommy these are conversations that
[57:10] we're having to have with our children
[57:14] I'm not talking about teenagers
[57:17] little kids
[57:20] now watch this
[57:22] if we are not wise and how we raise our
[57:25] kids if we are not wise and we're
[57:27] looking out for these things and
[57:29] teaching our children the ways of God
[57:32] and why it's wrong they're going to
[57:35] think it's okay
[57:39] so we gotta stand for truth
[57:43] we got to stand for what's right
[57:47] Hallelujah
[57:49] amen it's not easy
[57:51] but it has to be done
[57:53] right and so I think and I look out and
[57:56] I we got a bunch a bunch of little boys
[57:58] and everything like that and and stuff
[58:00] and you know and this is just me
[58:03] and you take it this is my opinion
[58:06] but it's like I don't believe we should
[58:09] be raising our children little boys
[58:12] it's okay to play with a little dolly
[58:16] it's okay to act like a girl oh it's
[58:19] funny who
[58:21] it's okay to do these things it's funny
[58:23] ha ha no it's not funny
[58:29] how many of us are going to play with
[58:31] these kinds of spirits
[58:33] I want my boys to be rough and tumble
[58:35] again get them boys
[58:40] we gotta be careful
[58:42] because if we don't watch these things
[58:45] within our children a lot of you have
[58:47] raised your children and stuff like that
[58:49] and that's okay if you believe what I'm
[58:51] saying you can say Amen
[58:54] things you have to watch out for when
[58:56] the girl is the firstborn you gotta
[58:58] watch for the boys because they're going
[59:00] to want to do what big sis does
[59:02] the boy is the firstborn the girl's
[59:05] going to want to be a tomboy
[59:07] because she's always rough and Tumbling
[59:09] With the bigger brother
[59:12] God give us wisdom
[59:13] as mothers and fathers to watch out over
[59:17] our children from a young age to say you
[59:20] know what son I'm one of my boys yet the
[59:23] other day and this is what struck me
[59:25] about it he told me he goes Dad I'm a
[59:28] girl
[59:29] I said you ain't no girl
[59:32] you're a boy and you're all boy
[59:37] no he was just messing around
[59:40] he was being funny
[59:41] but he realized that it wasn't funny
[59:45] because if we play with these things
[59:48] the spirits in this end time are no
[59:51] respecter of persons
[59:54] tell them what they are
[59:56] yeah amen God help us huh
[1:00:02] amen yeah it used to be that it was a
[1:00:06] shameful thing
[1:00:07] but now there's no shame in the world
[1:00:10] may we not be ashamed of this gospel
[1:00:14] that when we have an opportunity to
[1:00:16] present truth to somebody
[1:00:18] that we're not a backboneless
[1:00:20] wishy-washy person but we can tell the
[1:00:23] truth and love to the person that's
[1:00:25] wanting to hear it
[1:00:27] the anointed ones at the end time 1965
[1:00:29] brother Brown says underline that last
[1:00:32] days that's when it's going to happen
[1:00:34] perilous time shall come we are in it
[1:00:37] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:00:39] selves Covetous boasters proud
[1:00:41] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:00:43] unthankful that's amazing and Unholy
[1:00:47] look at this Bunch that we got today
[1:00:49] they're rotten even in man out on the
[1:00:52] street young men pulling their hair down
[1:00:54] over their forehead like with bangs like
[1:00:57] a woman it's perversion
[1:01:00] so what you're trying to tell me is the
[1:01:02] prophet is saying that a way that a
[1:01:04] young man will cut his hair after his
[1:01:06] bangs and it's all curled up over his
[1:01:08] eyebrows it's a perversion
[1:01:10] absolutely
[1:01:15] today we're living in you ever see these
[1:01:16] guys it's all
[1:01:18] long and curly and
[1:01:20] and they you know these guys it acts as
[1:01:24] a good sun visor
[1:01:28] what is it it's a perversion
[1:01:33] sodomites
[1:01:34] did you read in this year this month in
[1:01:36] Reader's Digest the American people at
[1:01:39] the age between I think it was 20 and 25
[1:01:41] years old is already in their middle age
[1:01:43] condition they're finished they're
[1:01:46] rotten science says that that a man is
[1:01:48] in his middle age and a woman when
[1:01:50] they're in their early 20s their body is
[1:01:53] so rotten and given over to filth oh
[1:01:56] America how off God would have hovered
[1:01:59] over you but now your hour is come you
[1:02:02] lead the world in filth
[1:02:06] this day these scriptures are being
[1:02:08] fulfilled before our very eyes there are
[1:02:11] people who are fulfilling the very
[1:02:13] prophecy of unrighteousness and a body
[1:02:16] of flesh but there's also a people who
[1:02:20] is fulfilling the scripture for this day
[1:02:23] and for this hour of people of
[1:02:25] righteousness of people of Holiness of
[1:02:28] people who stands on truth of people who
[1:02:31] love truth of people who loves the word
[1:02:33] of God
[1:02:35] and they are the word that's being made
[1:02:37] flesh the very fulfillment of the
[1:02:40] scriptures
[1:02:44] thank you Lord Philippians 4 verse 6 be
[1:02:47] careful for nothing but in everything by
[1:02:49] prayer and supplication with
[1:02:52] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:02:55] known unto God so in other words when
[1:02:58] you're bringing your requests before God
[1:03:00] thank him for the request before it has
[1:03:04] even come to pass
[1:03:06] that's faith
[1:03:09] Colossians 3 15 and let the peace of God
[1:03:12] rule in your hearts to the which you're
[1:03:14] you're called in one body
[1:03:17] and be thankful
[1:03:19] Colossians 4 2 continue in prayer and
[1:03:22] watching the same with Thanksgiving
[1:03:25] Thanksgiving and prayer go hand in hand
[1:03:28] Hallelujah
[1:03:32] the scripture does not say if things are
[1:03:34] going good if you've received good gifts
[1:03:36] if you're in good health and
[1:03:37] everything's okay to be thankful but in
[1:03:40] every situation no matter if it's good
[1:03:43] if it's bad if it's ugly if you've never
[1:03:46] been there before to be thankful unto
[1:03:49] God because this is his requirements for
[1:03:52] the elect of God
[1:03:57] now we'll notice that thankfulness is
[1:04:01] directly correlated with our attitude
[1:04:06] have you ever tried to be thankful with
[1:04:08] a bad attitude
[1:04:11] it doesn't happen
[1:04:13] so being thankful is directly correlated
[1:04:18] with our attitudes
[1:04:21] and our attitudes is directly correlated
[1:04:25] with the promises of God because brother
[1:04:28] Branham said the right mental attitude
[1:04:30] towards what any promise of God will
[1:04:33] bring it to pass
[1:04:34] so an unthankful person cannot bring the
[1:04:38] word of God to pass in their lives so
[1:04:41] that's why he's saying be ye thankful
[1:04:43] because when you're thankful your
[1:04:45] attitude is good and when your attitude
[1:04:47] is good your faith is high and when your
[1:04:50] faith is high all the promises of God is
[1:04:53] for us to believe in and to come to pass
[1:05:00] Hallelujah
[1:05:03] so our faith towards the promises of God
[1:05:05] is what determines whether it'll come to
[1:05:08] pass or not
[1:05:10] but that depends on our attitude
[1:05:13] and that depends on whether we're
[1:05:15] thankful or not
[1:05:16] without money or without price 1959
[1:05:19] brother Branham said sure they were
[1:05:21] thankful they were grateful and any man
[1:05:24] or woman that's born of the spirit of
[1:05:25] God and receives the Holy Ghost will
[1:05:28] always be thankful and the holy
[1:05:31] ghost-filled church said
[1:05:33] no matter whatever happens
[1:05:36] you'll be grateful
[1:05:38] Hallelujah
[1:05:40] huh it's easy to say when things are
[1:05:43] going good
[1:05:45] but when it's not going so good
[1:05:49] that's when the anchor holds
[1:05:53] yes sir
[1:05:54] now brother Branham Associates
[1:05:57] thankfulness and the healing of the body
[1:05:59] together many many times notice this the
[1:06:02] brass serpent 1953
[1:06:05] brother Branham says you want to get
[1:06:06] over the female trouble and the
[1:06:08] arthritis and things and that just go on
[1:06:11] off the platform thanking God for it
[1:06:15] that's all you have to do be thankful
[1:06:19] he's done it
[1:06:23] I he didn't even pray for the lady
[1:06:27] he just do you want to be you want to be
[1:06:29] healed of these things well sure I do
[1:06:31] that's why I'm here just be thankful
[1:06:35] why should I be thankful he said because
[1:06:38] he's done it
[1:06:41] it's already done it's already finished
[1:06:43] the work is already complete we just got
[1:06:46] to be thankful for it
[1:06:49] listen to this whatever he says to you
[1:06:51] do it 1953 oh father is this poor little
[1:06:54] uh old hand lays over here and mine know
[1:06:58] that maybe it stroked back to tears from
[1:07:00] a many crying baby's eyes uh rock the
[1:07:03] cradle maybe in a younger day the little
[1:07:04] baby would get hurt and come mother and
[1:07:06] you'd kiss away the tears and rock them
[1:07:08] away and it'll be all right but God
[1:07:11] it'll take your hand to wipe the tear
[1:07:14] tonight and to rock away the things but
[1:07:16] thou can do it Lord I pray that you'll
[1:07:19] Grant it may she be healed tonight now I
[1:07:21] lay hands upon her in Jesus name for her
[1:07:24] healing amen God bless you Sister go
[1:07:28] happy and rejoicing be thankful to God
[1:07:31] and you'll get well
[1:07:33] let's say thanks be to God
[1:07:38] so what is his what what is what is what
[1:07:41] is he telling her to do he's not telling
[1:07:43] her to go fast for 40 days he's not
[1:07:45] telling her to go and do some
[1:07:47] magnificent thing but he's saying go
[1:07:49] home tonight and be thankful and you
[1:07:52] will get well
[1:07:55] my
[1:07:57] the Queen of Sheba 1960 for your baby
[1:08:01] many suffer from the same disease do you
[1:08:03] believe it's it's little heart will get
[1:08:06] well and it'll be all right do you
[1:08:08] believe father God the baby's too little
[1:08:10] to have faith may it be well in Jesus
[1:08:13] Christ's name amen don't doubt the baby
[1:08:16] will live go home and be thankful to God
[1:08:19] now
[1:08:21] my these are just three examples of many
[1:08:24] many times where brother Branham after
[1:08:26] he has prayed for somebody or he's
[1:08:28] counseling for somebody in the prayer
[1:08:30] line he's saying you're going to be well
[1:08:32] it's already done just go now go
[1:08:35] rejoicing and be thankful for what God
[1:08:37] has already done
[1:08:45] brother Branham was trying to show the
[1:08:47] people that no matter what lays before
[1:08:49] them if they would just be thankful to
[1:08:51] God and the work that he has already
[1:08:54] accomplished that he will bring the
[1:08:57] promises to pass in their lives
[1:08:59] yes
[1:09:01] president Brown told us time and time
[1:09:03] again he said the work is finished
[1:09:06] it's already done it's already complete
[1:09:09] he would go as far to say if Jesus was
[1:09:12] here in a human body
[1:09:14] actually Jesus with a suit on he
[1:09:17] couldn't do anything more for you than
[1:09:20] what he has already done so brother
[1:09:23] Branham was trying to get her eyes onto
[1:09:26] the finished work and be thankful for
[1:09:29] what has already been completed
[1:09:35] Hallelujah all we have to do is accept
[1:09:38] it be thankful for it and then be
[1:09:42] patient for the promise to come to pass
[1:09:46] he hear the word it hasn't affect you
[1:09:49] you store it in your heart but a lot of
[1:09:52] times it doesn't come to pass right away
[1:09:55] and that's okay
[1:09:57] be patient and the promise will come to
[1:10:00] pass
[1:10:01] Hebrews 6 verse 15 and so after he had
[1:10:05] patiently endured
[1:10:07] he obtained the promise some of you
[1:10:11] right now you are patiently enduring and
[1:10:14] let me let me just admonish you and let
[1:10:17] me say continue to be patient in your
[1:10:20] enduring because the time will come
[1:10:23] when that seed will take Life The
[1:10:26] Promise will come to pass
[1:10:34] you know the Bible tells us to walk by
[1:10:37] faith and not by sight
[1:10:39] you know brother Branham got to a stage
[1:10:41] in his ministry where he was always
[1:10:43] looking for a vision
[1:10:45] he was
[1:10:47] I forget what sermon it is but he said
[1:10:49] yeah I would go and the people would
[1:10:51] come before me and they say brother
[1:10:53] Branham ah I just want to get well will
[1:10:56] I get will and and brother Brown would
[1:10:58] go and said well let me go into the back
[1:10:59] room let me go somewhere different and
[1:11:01] wait on a vision
[1:11:04] he was depending upon the gift
[1:11:07] that God had placed in his life because
[1:11:09] the gift never failed him
[1:11:12] and the Holy Spirit spoke to his heart
[1:11:14] and convicted him
[1:11:17] and said you don't have to wait for a
[1:11:20] vision
[1:11:21] because it's by faith and the promised
[1:11:25] word of God that brings the word to pass
[1:11:28] it's not the vision
[1:11:30] the vision is what would give the people
[1:11:33] the confidence and the faith but if we
[1:11:36] could have faith in the word hallelujah
[1:11:38] without a vision without somebody
[1:11:41] telling us anything
[1:11:45] that's real faith
[1:11:49] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] now before we can have faith to receive
[1:11:58] healing for God from God we must get rid
[1:12:01] of all uncertainty in our lives we must
[1:12:05] get get rid of all of the uncertainty
[1:12:08] concerning the will of God
[1:12:12] have any of you ever said well if it be
[1:12:14] God's will
[1:12:16] I'll get well if it's God's will
[1:12:19] if it's God's will I know I can do this
[1:12:22] and yeah but but if it's not God's will
[1:12:26] I guess it won't happen
[1:12:28] if it's not God's will I guess I'll
[1:12:31] never be delivered if it's not God's
[1:12:33] will I guess I'll always have to live
[1:12:35] with this if it's not if it's not if
[1:12:37] it's not we're so worried about
[1:12:39] something being God's will that it
[1:12:41] hinders our very faith
[1:12:45] so if you want to know the will of God
[1:12:48] for a situation in your life go to the
[1:12:50] word
[1:12:52] because the word has the answer
[1:13:00] now the question is is it God's will to
[1:13:04] be healed in our natural bodies I know
[1:13:07] it's a minor but it's still a part of
[1:13:09] God's word
[1:13:12] I know it's a minor and I know that the
[1:13:15] healing of of the soul is far greater if
[1:13:18] we never see a healing in our bodies but
[1:13:20] yet
[1:13:21] the healing of the body is still part of
[1:13:24] the word
[1:13:28] so what do we do we go to God's word
[1:13:32] because we want to see what the will of
[1:13:34] God is for this certain subject or this
[1:13:38] certain area in our lives
[1:13:42] now when you go through the word what I
[1:13:44] want you guys to do tonight or tomorrow
[1:13:47] whenever you get some time go to your
[1:13:49] Bible go to your Concordance
[1:13:51] everybody's got a concordance look up
[1:13:54] heal or healed or healing wherever those
[1:13:57] words occur and look up the scriptures
[1:14:00] and see for yourself what the word says
[1:14:05] because when you know the will of God
[1:14:07] for a certain situation an area in your
[1:14:10] life nobody can take you out of it it
[1:14:13] takes away all the uncertainty it takes
[1:14:16] away all the doubt because now you're
[1:14:18] standing upon the promised word you're
[1:14:20] not standing upon your intellects well I
[1:14:22] don't know if it's God's will or not all
[1:14:24] that is is a seed of Discord in your
[1:14:27] life
[1:14:29] it's a weed
[1:14:32] how can we expect to grow corn in our
[1:14:34] lives and to reap a harvest of corn when
[1:14:38] we're sowing weeds into our hearts
[1:14:43] well it worked for this other person but
[1:14:45] I don't know about you that's a lie
[1:14:49] Hallelujah
[1:14:59] so what we want to do there's a few
[1:15:01] things that that we must do first
[1:15:04] don't we understand that the word of God
[1:15:07] is a seed so what we want to do we want
[1:15:10] to plant the will of God which is his
[1:15:12] word and we want to plant it into our
[1:15:14] hearts because if we plant the word into
[1:15:16] our hearts the word will harvest in its
[1:15:20] due time
[1:15:21] now there's a few things that we must do
[1:15:24] also as Believers we must hide the word
[1:15:27] of God in our hearts
[1:15:28] because when the word is hidden within
[1:15:31] our hearts no man can take it from us
[1:15:38] we need to be as the Lord told Joshua
[1:15:41] and we need to meditate on these things
[1:15:44] day and night
[1:15:46] why do we have to meditate on them day
[1:15:49] and night because we are saturating our
[1:15:52] whole being with the word of God and
[1:15:55] when we saturate our lives with the word
[1:15:57] of God the word of God will bring the
[1:16:00] past the word of God
[1:16:04] that's so simple
[1:16:07] but yet we need to apply it so we hear
[1:16:11] the word we seek it out diligently
[1:16:14] diligently okay here's here's I'll just
[1:16:18] talk on healing for instance here's this
[1:16:20] healing I I have this infirmity and I
[1:16:22] need rid of it and and and I just want
[1:16:25] it to be the will of God
[1:16:27] it is the will of God
[1:16:29] that we would be healed
[1:16:31] so we take the word now we search the
[1:16:34] scriptures and we put our concordance
[1:16:36] together we write it down after we write
[1:16:38] it down we hide it in our hearts after
[1:16:40] we hide it in our hearts we meditate on
[1:16:43] those things day in and day out because
[1:16:46] when we're meditating and we're
[1:16:47] saturating ourselves in the word of God
[1:16:50] it keeps the world out of our lives
[1:16:53] it keeps doubt out of our Lives it keeps
[1:16:57] those things that would hinder us from
[1:17:00] Walking with God how we should by faith
[1:17:02] out of our Lives why because doubt and
[1:17:05] faith will not mix together
[1:17:08] and when we're flooding ourselves by
[1:17:12] Faith by positivity of God's word
[1:17:23] so when we saturate our lives with the
[1:17:26] promises that's written within this word
[1:17:28] we will no longer be affected by the
[1:17:31] temporal things
[1:17:34] by our situations and the things that
[1:17:37] are around to say guess what yeah
[1:17:38] they're there yeah it's a burden to our
[1:17:41] tour to our carnal man but our spiritual
[1:17:45] man is not affected why because we're
[1:17:48] walking by faith
[1:17:52] take your eyes off the temporal
[1:17:55] and put them on the eternal
[1:18:02] so if God has given us a promise he will
[1:18:05] bring that promise to pass in our lives
[1:18:07] when it is met with the right attitude
[1:18:10] hey man as the musicians will come
[1:18:13] we'll bring this to a close
[1:18:16] so now I looked up a few scriptures
[1:18:19] concerning healing within the body
[1:18:23] because what do I want to do I want to
[1:18:25] impart something into your mind and into
[1:18:28] your heart which is the word of God and
[1:18:31] when you take the word of God and it is
[1:18:33] imparted Into the Heart of a person
[1:18:36] guess what happens that word of God now
[1:18:38] will begin to grow
[1:18:41] something you'll begin to take place
[1:18:44] perhaps attitudes will begin to change
[1:18:47] why because how can you have a bad
[1:18:49] attitude when you're surrounding
[1:18:51] yourself with promised scriptures that
[1:18:54] are eternal
[1:18:57] and as our attitude begins to get better
[1:18:59] we begin now to be thankful within our
[1:19:03] hearts
[1:19:05] father thank you for what you're doing
[1:19:07] in my life
[1:19:08] thank you for bringing the promise to
[1:19:10] pass even before it has physically come
[1:19:14] to pass
[1:19:17] Mark 9 verse 23 Jesus said unto him if
[1:19:21] thou cast believe
[1:19:22] all things are possible to him that
[1:19:25] believeth
[1:19:27] Isaiah 53 verse 5 but he was wounded for
[1:19:30] our transgressions
[1:19:32] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:19:35] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:19:38] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:19:42] what kind of scripture is that that is
[1:19:44] the scripture that we need to impart
[1:19:46] into our hearts
[1:19:48] that for my transgressions guess what he
[1:19:51] was wounded and for mine iniquities and
[1:19:54] the things that I've done wrong and the
[1:19:56] things that I will ever do wrong guess
[1:19:58] what he was bruised for those inequities
[1:20:01] I say thank you Lord
[1:20:06] the chastisement of our peace my peace
[1:20:09] your peace guess what it was all placed
[1:20:11] upon him
[1:20:13] with his stripes we are healed that's a
[1:20:16] scripture let it go down into your heart
[1:20:19] first Peter 2 24 who his own self bear
[1:20:22] our sins and his own body and on the
[1:20:24] tree that we being dead to sin should
[1:20:27] live unto righteousness by whose Stripes
[1:20:29] he were healed
[1:20:31] acts 10 38
[1:20:33] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:20:35] the Holy Ghost and with power he went
[1:20:37] about doing good and healing all that
[1:20:40] were oppressed of the devil
[1:20:42] for God was with him
[1:20:45] Matthew 8 16-17 when the even was come
[1:20:49] they brought on to him many that were
[1:20:51] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:20:53] the Spirits by laying hands and
[1:20:55] anointing and
[1:20:57] with this word
[1:21:01] and healed all that were sick
[1:21:05] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:21:07] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[1:21:09] himself took our infirmities
[1:21:12] and he bear our sicknesses
[1:21:15] Matthew chapter 10 8 7-8 and as you go
[1:21:19] preached saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:21:21] at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[1:21:23] raise the Dead cast out Devils freely
[1:21:26] you've received
[1:21:27] freely give
[1:21:29] Hebrews 13 and 8. Jesus Christ the same
[1:21:33] yesterday
[1:21:34] and today
[1:21:35] and forever
[1:21:37] as we read these scriptures of of
[1:21:40] healing and and deliverances and all
[1:21:42] these different things that these people
[1:21:44] of old uh uh witnessed and and we're
[1:21:48] part of we think well that was just in
[1:21:51] days gone by but I love it
[1:21:54] the theme scripture of this message
[1:21:57] Hebrews 13 and 8. that Jesus Christ is
[1:22:02] not just
[1:22:04] Jesus Christ of the old but he is the
[1:22:07] same today he will be the same tomorrow
[1:22:09] and he will be the same forever because
[1:22:12] he changes not therefore if he was the
[1:22:16] same Jesus the things that he did when
[1:22:18] he walked the shores of Galilee guess
[1:22:21] what he's the same Jesus tonight
[1:22:23] and because he is the same and he
[1:22:25] changes not guess what he is able to
[1:22:27] perform the same Miracles he is able to
[1:22:30] do the same things the same Miracles and
[1:22:33] the same deliverances can happen right
[1:22:35] amongst us why because Jesus is amongst
[1:22:38] us
[1:22:40] thank you
[1:22:41] sir but he wants us to do one thing
[1:22:44] first
[1:22:46] he wants us to be thankful
[1:22:50] so now if we would just take a uh a
[1:22:54] dialogue I guess of our lives and go
[1:22:56] well I wonder how my attitude has been I
[1:22:59] wonder have I been so grateful have I
[1:23:01] been have I been thankful uh how has my
[1:23:04] attitude been towards the promises of
[1:23:06] God of have I been all negativity and
[1:23:09] and looking at my circumstances or have
[1:23:12] you been standing upon the promises of
[1:23:14] God by faith if you've been standing let
[1:23:18] me encourage you keep standing
[1:23:21] and when you keep standing keep on
[1:23:23] standing and keep standing until that
[1:23:26] promise has come to pass
[1:23:30] because from a thanks God
[1:23:34] will not reject a thankful heart
[1:23:37] God will not reject a thankful attitude
