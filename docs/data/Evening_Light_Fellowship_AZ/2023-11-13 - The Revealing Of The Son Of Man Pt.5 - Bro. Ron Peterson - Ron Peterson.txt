are what you're going through right now is the best time that you're going to have from here on out so get happy it ain't going to get easier it's going to get tougher the Bible says behold I shake heaven and earth one more time and those that can be shook guess what it's purging time this is not a time to try to explain things huh Jesus was not politically correct didn't explain everything except you eat my flesh drink my blood you got no part with me and many of them were offended it's an offensive time you find out there's a lot of people that say well I just can't go no more with it well Jesus didn't run after him in fact he looked at those who were still with him and said does this offend you and that that great man Peter where could we go I want to ask you if you leave this where you going you going back to a dog like a dog to its vomit and a hog to its Waller cuz you go back to Jezebel religion come on you go right back huh to three Gods trinitarian you go back to denomination I'm sorry so there's no uh there's no being uh apologetic about what we believe no because you know what hey once God's revealed it to you once you see it you see it and others have followed for a long time and for whatever reason some of them are just kind of caught up in in let's say the vortex like an 18wheeler when you get behind them and you draft and you feel just kind of getting pulled right along see and and they go on for years but there comes a time when maybe you get out and you think you're going to pass and all of a sudden you hit that turbulent whoa whoa whoa that happened to me on a motorcycle one time I got behind I oh man this is I just cruising right I could almost put it on uh just you know like in neutral do thing just sucking me along I thought well okay I'm going to pass I get out here huh yeah you you find that even who was it uh those guys the the the right stuff those guys when who was it the the X15 rocket and uh they broke the sound barrier for the first time and they got out there and and they didn't know if what's going to happen huh get up there to mock one mock two whatever and they're they're going along like this and all of a sudden they hear this loud boom all the controllers oh my oh my we lost him we lost him and over the micel fromone yeah that might happen to you you might break the sound barrier one time in church you might be sitting there all of a sudden ye you find out you break that sound barrier it's unlimited speed [Music] hallelujah praise God you ready to have church yes sir amen amen thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah let's stand together let's sing God is good all the time I believe that Saints Amen brother Robert help me out when you're walking through the valley and shadows all around let's

good all the time he put a song of Praise In This Heart of M God is good all the time through the darkest night his light will shine God is good God is good all the time and we were Sinners So Unworthy and yet for us he chose to die and killed us with his holy spirit now we can stand and testify that is love is Everlasting and his Mercy they shall never end God is good all the time but a song of Praise In This Heart Of God is good all the time through the darkest night his light will shine God is good God is good [Music] all God is good one more time God is good God is good all Hallelujah God bless you thank you musicians let's go directly to the word I got a lot on my heart this morning amen I pray that the holy spirit will Quicken me with a Divine and Supernatural anointing yes Lord come under that anointed word and that you can come under that same anointing Because unless you're sensitized unless you've been prayed up unless your life is consecrated before God you can have anointings all around you can you can have the word going and it's going for them people being set free and he sent his word and it heals the people you can have all kinds of Supernatural and you just sit there and not catch nothing that's right so you have a part that you got to play you you you like the brother said you got to press the button to get to the top that's right amen you got something to do amen you got to pray read your Bible you got to seek God on now amen amen and if you seek Him you shall find him if you knock the door will be open huh thank you Lord amen praise the Lord St John 16 and then we'll go to Hebrews 6 and and then to Luke 17 so St John chapter 16 12- 16 Jesus speaking to his disciples he has so many sermons he'd like to preach to them he's got so much that he would like to say to them he's got so much he would like to give to them but watch what he says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now he recognizes there's coming a time they will catch it amen he's not making fun of them he's just saying oh I got so much in fact I got so much on my heart it's going to take me an eternity to reveal myself amen but he starts out you cannot bear them now but watch this how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you notice he's going to show you things all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you and just a few sentences every time I'm going to show you I'm going to show you if you ask God to show you he will that's part of his will his word is his will a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father Hebrews chapter 6 if you would turn with me now now how many know that the Apostle Paul was one born out of du season he was one that the disciples even said it's hard to be understood now here is one of these quandaries when when he's talking to the Hebrews we're talking Jewish people we're talking Hebrews people raised up they know the law they know the law of Moses they know these things so watch what he says therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ wow now I imagine there was breakes locking up everywhere when he said that whoa why in the world do we leave our foundation why do we leave this doctrine of Christ cuz Christ is the anointing and it's the anointed word of all the ages whoa Paul oh hang on there are times that when a pastor a preacher a prophet says something and all of a sudden you don't understand your breaks of human carnality lock up and you go whoa amen and you may not understand just keep reading amen just hang on it's a Tim relased Revelation let us go unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment do you see this and this we will do if God permit amen and even as Brother David said here out loud therefore that's why if you go back and you see after the order of MDC yeah there and you see what Paul was talking about therefore let us go unto Perfection how many of you are interested imperfection you better be because Jesus said as your father in Heaven is now if God tells you you got to have Perfection you need it but understand God has to provide a way lest he makes you frustrated amen huh and God don't want frustrated Christians right they don't want you getting up okay I'm going to be perfect today I'm going to go and and next thing you know you stub your toe on your way to go brush your teeth and why me why all these all a sudden your day is ruined on so it's not in the Perfection of this carnal man but the Perfection that comes through Christ amen amen so um let us go to Luke 17 now if you would please and amos's in-laws are here with us Luke and Miriam God bless you brother Luke Sister Miriam it's always a blessing to have you with us do wiise Luke 17 verse 28 as it was in days of Noah as it was in the days of lot watch I know I verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it is there anything wrong with those things no we're doing but the same day that lot so now watch while they're building planting doing all this somebody's being moved of God Amen understand God is moving someone so here lot let's look at this but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all wow I thought God's a god of love he is a god of love but he's also a god of judgment and don't forget it because our god it says serve him with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire don't you play with God Amen don't you dare play with God let me tell you don't you be dead caught dead without Christ amen amen verse 30 very familiar portion of scripture even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may God bless the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God I want to continue on with this thought this morning the revealing of the son of man this is part five I want to take a t a a subject of who touched me now for just a moment let me just kind of share some things with with you to lay a little bit of a foundation for this direction and we know that brother Brenham said that the Jews it was a Jewish custom for hands to be laid on is just the Jewish way he said but with the Gentiles It Was Always by faith we're going to look at this according to the scripture you're going to see it it's it's so plain and once you see it it really it changes the whole thing now the wife and I set up last night and we listened to the tape speak to this mountain brother Brenham says you know this is one of those scriptures that I've never preached on because I never understood it he said if you say into this mountain be thou removed how many of you know that well which one of you have ever moved a mountain I want to ask you who in the scriptures ever removed mountains whoever said be thou removed and it was moved the closest one we have it is John the Baptist and it said he'll fill up the valleys and he'll tear down the mountains and the high places will be made low other than that what it is it's a figurative of speech it's hey you got something in your life that seems like a mountain right and I tell you what all of us can Cruise along when it's flat and if we're not careful we're lowlander Believers huh the moment we start to get an incline much further huh yeah you're out of breath you're not used to it okay but if somebody else who is used to climbing once in a while huh who can get up there into the High Altitude sir hey I have a I have a a cabin up there in presc at 7400t elevation and it takes me about a day to kind of get acclimated be you don't get that deep breath full of oxygen but if we're not careful we're we're lowland Believers and we never get to the altitude and we never go up hill and going up hill have any of you you hiked a hill before yeah yeah you you know I remember one of the first times we were going to climb uh to a peak near my hometown in California and we were we we actually I better not tell all of the story We ditched school one day to take and we took a flag pool and a flag and we wanted to plant it on top of a week that the next day when all the kids went to school we'd say hey you guys see that flag up there that was us we did it yesterday but it's amazing one of my friends had a house that was way up in the Sierra Madre Mountains right there near our hometown and so we left from his house like 4 in the morning we're ready hey all of us we were in football so we're in pretty good shape from running wind Sprints and everything well anyway we we start going and let me tell you you you you you start climbing and you go up and you you think I think that's the peak yeah that's not not much furthery hey you guys stop no it's not much further and you get up there and guess what it was the peak before the peak we didn't see all the valleys we didn't see all the little ups and downs we didn't see the little detours that we had to go around and guess what the moment that we went up to the next Peak we found out that there was still another Peak between the peak we wanted to get to how many of you have understand that many times you see where you want to go but you don't see the little valleys and the little things that you're going to go through amen but keep going Hall we're not quitters we don't turn around just because things get rough amen so I want to take and to show you from the scriptures that the Gentiles okay it is they are being moved on by faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen by faith one of my favorite chapters is there in Hebrews by faith Noah by faith Abraham by faith every one of them by faith well if took faith for them to claim the goal in their day then what about you and I and Faith cometh by hear hearing the word of God that's right so if you want more faith increase your hearing but it's only to those who have an ear because many will say that did not he it say that Elias well said that many have ears to hear but they hear not many have eyes to see but they see not so we're not talking about a natural ear and a natural eyesight we're talking about that elect seed having an ability and it's given to you before let me let me say before the foundation of the world it wasn't something you did it wasn't something that you attained to you were born with with the grace of God that there would come a time in your life that God would open your eyes and you would see the revealing of the son of man now you might be raised around this message you might go to church you might learn the Sunday School teachings the songs you come to church you're you're uh you're brought along with your parents but if this ain't for you there's coming a time when you will go do your thing that's right so yeah time tested Memorials of God you're going to be tested are you here because Mom and Dad are you not old enough now you're just waiting till you turn 18 and you can be your own man your own woman you can do your own thing well there'll come a time and when you do you're going to find out there ain't nothing out there but if you think that's life it's like it's like this guy had all kinds of money and instead he didn't want to be buried in a coffin he wanted to be buried in His Cadillac this is true so the guy he had his Cadillac all prepared and they propped him up they got a crane and he went they dug the big old hole and he put him down it wasn't a coffin it was his Cadillac Man and they propped him up and he put him down into the hole and somebody said man what a way to go are you kidding me hey that's not a way to go no because he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son listen that guy may think he's going to drive that Cadillac in the afterlife he's mistaken anyway now I want you to understand that there's three polls and to those of you who are not familiar with this message let me just say this that Jesus Christ himself had three PS he first started with healing and no one was offended by healing in fact they all come they wanted to see uh the lepers cleansed they wanted to see uh people's arms restored eyesight restored praise God thou would a man come from God because no man can do these things except that God be with him so again the healing Jesus and all kinds of Miracles then he turns into discernment where he starts telling and Discerning their hearts behold an Israelite in whom there is no God when did you know me when before your brother called you while you were under the Fig tree uh sycamore tree I saw you right amen that's right wow Rabbi he said just because I told you where you're from your name where I saw you he said greater things shall you see so then in a third poll and we know his ministry changes and this is very important for you to catch that the change of ministry and the change of administration it happens in every age and it's happening right now in this lisian age we're a part of it it's going on right now the ministry of Jesus Christ in this message did not stop when the voice of Malachi 4 ceased and he went off the scene we don't have to pray for a return Ministry in fact let me shock you it's not a return Ministry it's a continuation of the same Ministry but God changes Administration he changes his mask he goes from one to many are you following me so there's a change of administration if you miss that then then you're missing the whole thing we're changing right now into something right now that is a process and all of us are a part of it amen yes sir I don't want to get ahead of myself but let me bring to you a quote here in 1961 getting in the spirit we find out that God brought Elisha through the same process three different stages then after he left the school went down to Jordan crossed over Jordan then he had a double portion of Elijah Spirit was upon him now Jesus said these things shall I do shall you do also more than these shall you do for I go to the father this is the type of Christ and the church somebody say that's us Christ and the church Christ was taken up in the same spirit that was upon Christ came upon his church amen so here's the scenario I want you to understand Elisha tried Elijah tried to shake off Elisha how many of you know that you stay here I've got to go and Elijah kept saying oh no as the Lord God liveth I'm going with you so fine he goes from the first Pole to the second he said now you stay here I've got to go further oh no I want you to understand there comes times in your life God may just shake you up a little bit to see if you're going to stay and say okay okay go ahead and go I'll stay here I'm happy brother Bram said watch that first stage he said come into justification many say I'm happy with that I'm just happy to be justified I don't want anything to do with sanctification because then then my life I got to clean up my life oh my and then the gifts of the Spirit all know you see brother Rim said many will go to justification stay there many will go to sanctification stay there how many of you want to just keep going God do not as the Lord thy God liveth I'm going with you there's got to be a determination I'm not staying here try to shake him off Jesus tried shaking off his disciples does this offend you except you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood this man's a cannibal he didn't go out there and and explain it to everybody no they sat there I can just imagine those disciples had gotten some of their friends and different ones maybe even relatives and said hey come on over I want you to hear Jesus of Nazareth and oh man uh maybe he's going to do mirales today and and and there's the crowd the whole multitude and they see him and and he he's walking out and everybody sh sh sh here he comes here he comes the master speaking everybody's looking except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me right I can imagine Peter oh my why didn't you do a miracle get their attention first do some huh come on now let's bring it right on down to our day a lot of times I have different ones whether it be my family or some of you invite a neighbor a friend and guess what the pastor preaches a scorcher and you're going oh my why in the world of all services never forget the time I was overseas just a small group could have been more than 25 30 people and man I was preaching and I was preaching on women cutting her hair and manicure and painted face and hoop earrings and guest sitting right on the front row right here painted fingernails hoop ear Rings short hair and she's looking right at me now I thought okay Lord I felt led to preach this this morning it is your word and if there eled maybe the way I present it I could offend him cuz it's true sometimes it is the way we approach someone but I was preaching I felt led of it you know what she never got upset her face didn't get red her nostrils didn't flare and she didn't get upset in fact she came to me right after the service and she said no one's ever preached this before I've never heard that but it Bears witness with me I've had some women for the first time never hearing about a woman cutting a hair and it's an Abomination before God and I've had shired women sit there and pull on their hair like okay grow grow I I wish it would grow right now that it would be like sister Megan's almost all the way down to the floor as she walks I thank God for those of you that have long hair because it's a glory unto you that's right so sometimes you don't have to try to explain it all see we're we're talking about this faith in this end time here right now for not just healing that's the children's bread but we want something that's going to be so stimulating so activating so quickening that you're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and I'm saying it's going on right now transformation is taking place right now line upon line precept upon precept here a little for the glory of the terrestrial is one thing but the glory of the celestial is far greater so what you did this past week what you did in your career and all the money you make it it's going to burn but what you're doing right now in the house of God your attitude towards the word may depend upon your Eternal destination Lord speak to our hearts this morning take the word and let the son of man be revealed thank youus God's beginning to move yes he is in his bride around the world it's happening it's moving and and it's a very subtle it's it huh some people are looking for some big Flash no it's here a little there a little God giving you in fact I'll be preaching on this I'm going to give you previews I show you through the life of Abraham and God Appears under Abraham in Genesis 12 and he builds an altar wow I want you to understand that every time God reveals himself to you it's an appearing every time that God reveals to you something from his word because he's always going to take you back to the word because that's his absolute so when he reveals to you something from the word it's an appearing and God appeared unto Abraham and he paid tithes God appeared unto Abraham and he built an alar and he worship God Appears to him and and he does things so the appearing of God when you come to church when you're at home when you're reading your Bible when you're alone when you're taking a walk in the park when God all of a sudden opens your eyes of understanding you should understand God is doing something and what he's doing he's taking a word attribute and he's pulling it out of you I want you to go to church he reveals it to you and he pulls it and you say Thank you Lord and you go to church Revelation that is not made manifest is only head knowledge got to be made manifest you say you have faith show me your works because works is Faith expressed amen not everyone that starts will finish we got to realize that God's thinning down the crowd he's going to thin it down some more there are going to be a few more next week next month there are going to be a few more that will leave and go on but see because not everyone that started out of Egypt crossed over Jordan that's right not everyone that started with Christ went to the upper room not everyone that started in those healing campaigns stayed around for the third poll finish Jesus now Narrows his ministry down the multitudes are sent away and he says come tells his disciples come let us go aside to a desert place you like that desert place somebody say desert place place he went to a desert place he didn't go up to where the trees were green and the grass was tall you guys are all going he went to a desert he went to a desert Place God does things for a purpose and there he began to explain or expound unto them they said why do you always speak to us in Parables because it's not given to them they will not catch it I will preach and it will say that the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto this and it's the kingdom is likened unto that and they're going to sit there and they're going to try to understand they're going to try to absorb what I'm telling them and they sit there with a big question mark what's he talking about but the elect they sit there wow Kingdom of Heaven is liken in and there he began to explain to expound upon The Parables you know what he was doing when he was revealing he was revealing the son of man you want to know some seed fell upon good ground some seed fell upon the Wayside some seed uh along the ditch so on and so forth understand it depends on what kind of ground you got this morning nothing wrong with the seed it was the ground we all ought to say God let me be good ground let me be the ground that I bring forth huh some of you Farmers from up in Canada you know every time the farmers get together and they talk about Harvest time they want to know what kind of ratio what kind of uh Hey from the how much that you you you swed how much did you reap back some 20 fold some 40 fold I want to be a hundredfold I don't want to be a little tree my wife bought a pomegranate tree the other day I thought praise the Lord buy a pomegranate tree it's scriptural it grows good in the Des she brought this pomegranate tree it says it's so big it's got one little pomegranate on it right it's so funny my wife's going out and she's watering that thing she's going wow look at that pomegranate you know we went out there a couple days later it's gone my daughter Rebecca it wasn't right but I don't want to be some little tree with one measly little piece of fruit huh do you know what they do to fruit trees or vines in order to make it fruitful they prune it they trim it oh you don't need that Branch oh you don't need that little thing and you're like he's sitting there pruning your tree yeah oh man all of a sudden hey you know what it does it's putting the tree in the shock stop come on he prunes it that it'll bring forth more fruit Hey listen when you see those Citrus Groves you will find trees lading down with all kind their branches are heavy with all kinds of oranges God help us to be that kind of a tree in good ground Hallelujah bringing forth how hereby know how that you might glorify the father amen bring forth much fruit than you Lord much fruit not not well you know one little piece of fruit I want my tree Laden down yeah God prune me if there's something that's not right huh that's what they do they go out to th to those grape Vines and everything they take the little sucker thing huh they pull it off and tomato plants and everything to this one that don't belong there what are you doing you're hurting the plant no I'm not I'm making it more fruitful that's why you need to come to church you need those little suckers pulled off of you you don't need this oh what are you doing stop you're going to live just keep going amen Jesus Narrows his ministry his new ministry begins now by taking the word and revealing it in fact I will tell you that the only time after the Resurrection The only thing the only miracle that Jesus does is open eyes that right so he's gone beyond the first and second PLL of his ministry he's not majoring on minors anymore so we got two on the road to EMAs and guess what the Lord has been crucified they're all upset they got long lips and they're walking and they are sad and the resurrected Lord Jesus the Bible says and he joined himself watch this union he joins himself to them he said why are you so sad where where have you been Buddy haven't you seen on YouTube didn't you see on CNN or Fox News didn't you catch it man the same one that we thought was him yeah they crucified him we watched him he died he said said it is finished we saw him take him down off the cross we thought it was him and the Bible says that he began to tell him the scriptures concerning himself is it not written is it not yeah and all of a sudden these guys they're yeah right amen amen and as they're talking their hearts are burning with in them but they're not catching the revealing of the son of man they're they're they're they're catching heartburn issues and I think that's sometimes what happens to people they come to church all they gets heartburn oh my heart was burning ah and they go outside and the Flames extinguish huh back to the old Diamond Backs and back to the old this and that just the things of the world who cares about diamond back I couldn't tell you right now a name of a player and I guess they went to the what do they call World Series I wanted to say Super Bowl but that's that's football they went to the World Series I can't tell you a name of one player to save my life right now huh I couldn't I'm not into it now if you're into it you'll know who it is probably they're batting statistics and everything that's so fine but one day you'll find out not so important huh I'll never forget one time up uh you know uh friend of mine uh he and I uh we decided that we're going to play hookie on Church brother Mike Patterson and them uh we all went together in Flagstaff well it was time for the Super Bowl Super Bowl Sunday guess what we had two services on Sunday well we decided we're going to watch the Super Bowl and you know my wife says you're your backslid don't judge me I go to church the whole rest of the year one day one day that's all I want to do one service service yeah huh man I'm sitting there and she said I'm going to church well you go without me so we went there we watched the Super Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday what a joke huh but at the moment we thought I'm going to do it I'm G to huh how many of you have been so stubborn I'm going to do it make fun of me I don't care what you do you think you're so holy cuz you're going to church hey I've gone through the whole Spectrum uh you know Hey listen and you know what I found out that when I got older it didn't matter anymore I didn't even know when they're playing I didn't even know who's playing I could care less and the closer I get to God and the more that the Rapture is coming close and close and close and we're seeing the revealing of the son of man hey that's the only thing I'm interested in man I there something that gets me excited is going to get me out of here I don't want to stay here I don't want to be here when all of this stuff starts going on I don't want to be here when the pale horse rider starts to right amen amen amen now this new ministry it goes from a one man to a multi-member it goes from one man Jesus Christ to the day of Pentecost and the spirit of God now enters into them and when he the spirit of Truth is come do you see that when he the spirit of Truth has come he says he will guide you into all truth am and so there on the day of Pentecost the ministry was the same but it's changing who has it it's a new Administration and the devil was sitting there I got him I got him I thought I had him in the days of Moses I killed all the children I thought thought I had him and guess what he slipped through my fingers I thought I had him in the days when Christ was born I killed all the the newborn uh Sons I thought I had him and so when Christ was crucified I got him all I got to do is hold him three days that's all hey on the fourth day all I got to do is parade his body through Jerusalem and Christianity is over that's all they got to do but guess what the grave couldn't hold you hallelujah thank you Lord thank they went the disciples went they brought the spices to prepare the body because they couldn't finish it all before the Sabbath they're not expecting him to be risen and when they come and there they came to the tomb and when they do the stone is rolled away oh my what happened because it was set with a Roman seal do you know what you do with a Roman seal they take the tomb they take the the the the stone and they put a cement over it and one of the the authorities from Rome takes a seal and puts it in there and you don't break the seal let you deal with Rome and those guards huh we we we got some kind of weird understanding that these little guards that are standing there looking with their miniskirt on and their little phony helmets and and they're standing there trying to guard this tomb these are the Elite these are the fighting Green Beret of the Roman legion these guys are the top of the top and when an angel comes guess what they fall back as dead man you come into the presence of God you come into the presence of angelic beings Brother Band said whenever God comes by whenever he comes there and he said when that angel comes to me you would think that I'd be dancing and shouting he said it's fear it's trembling for two or three days he said I'm not even the same let me tell you my brother and my sister we tend to think that a lot of times when this a anointing comes that we're going to be jumping and shouting sometimes it's going to be to where it's under control brother look up the the quote huh brother Paul yeah Supreme anointing brother R said you you got it all backwards he said it's the word of God coming to you and it's revealed to you and it's under control amen the new ministry so watch this so they asked brother Brandon this question would a bride of Christ let's go to questions answer 63 would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she consists of Apostles prophets evangelists teachers pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble so when somebody tells you that you just press play they got something wrong it's not the word I'm sorry don't be deceived somebody told me the other day he well when we get into heaven when we get over there God's going to press play for you to are you kidding me brother renom says that God does not use mechanical devices to preach the gospel he's always used man in every age Whenever there was an issue whenever the people got away whenever Israel or anybody the children of God got away from things God sent them a tape recorder God sent him a man amen for God so loved the world he sent a man the son of man I want you to understand this revealing of the son of man continues he did not stop when the prophet of God went off the scene but guess what God's doing he's got a new Administration it's now just one that's right you see the devil said I got him but guess what on the day of Pentecost this same seed that went down and remember it's got to be planted it's got to corrupt and all of a sudden there comes a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and the spirit of God falls upon each one of them and they are there waiting for the promise which is told them that they would come to them is that right they're waiting there am they weren't doing anything they didn't have the piano going they didn't have the song leer I think hey let's sing and we'll get Happ no they were sitting like what you're doing but the thing that they did do is they got into one mind and one Accord and they began to say God said stay here and carry until you were ued with power power is something and guess what is the power of transformation Faith you're not getting transformed you're not getting out of here you're not getting raptured unless it's Faith doing it in you amen for by grace are you saved through faith and it being a gift of God not of yourselves it's not the The Works you do lest any man boast I guarantee you when we get over there and we all go through those ply Gates there's not going to be any one of us saying open up ye gates you Everlasting let me in because I was the best guy and loua I deserve it I was in church I never said a cuss word I never thought a bad thought hey God open up I'm going in uhuh you know what we're all going to be doing oh God oh God by grace and the thing that I think that excites me is when we get all over there do you know why God's going to allow us to be here on Earth on Earth 30 to 40 days before the resurrection huh before the catching away I should say but during this time 30 to 40 days okay because when we go up and he takes us there he doesn't want any of you looking oh hey did Ron make it you he do hey hey did Ron make it now he's not going to have any of you looking around huh so 30 to 40 days we have here so we can gather together he made it he made it wow and there going to be people that are going to walk through and all of a sudden you're going to go oh wow he made it she made it but the thing that's really going to be humbling to you is when you walk through people are going to go now I know there's Grace how many of you can say Amen to that because you realize it wasn't anything you did it was God by his grace his Sovereign power huh you are elected you are predestinated that third pole the revealing of the son of man he tried shaking you up but you like a bulldog wouldn't go he tried to send you down he tried tried to put his fan upon he tried to purge you he tried to get you to quit but you said I'm sitting right here I'm elected I'm chosen of God and I don't care I may not understand it but I believe [Applause] it somebody give him praise this morning it's not a return Ministry it's because the ministry never left it just changed changed its mess God in morha now it's God in you this mystery that's been hid down Through the Ages is now revealed what is it Christ in you amen amen amen thank you Lord see Big Revival time's over multitudes are not going to come in anymore no it's going to be one here one there h and sometimes it could be a message family you raise them up the kids yeah you know they got all these issues I've had at one time I had this pastor he had several daughters and we were taking care of the kids and the kid said brother Ron we've never done anything wrong we don't know what to repent of I've never

uniforms the guys with their Knuckles all bloody their helmets they got the the colors of the other helmets that they've been clashing they're all Tarn these guys they're huffing and puffing they come

to do every man do their job this is the play We're going to run now you do your job amen I'm going to say to all of you you do your job you didn't get here by circumstance this is goal line defense this is where it it counts this is it this is overtime I thought this game would have been over long time ago but we're still here so I'm going to tell all of you understand this is it get tough you see these football players you know what they do they start slapping one another on the helmet hey do it do your job come on come on and they dig down on the inside you know what the bridey Christ is doing right now she's digging down yeah there are people leaving this message yeah there's people they're getting offended oh but I'll not leave I'm here to the end I'm going to see it until this thing's over because I believe one day I'm getting out of [Applause] here Elijah tried to shake Elisha off Jesus tried to shake his followers off yeah you can't shake them off that's right they're tenacious huh like a kid take him in the swimming pool he don't know how to swim you try to get them off you no no hey let go like worse than an octopus just trust me I don't trust nobody Hold On To You amen amen hallelujah you can't shake them on brother Bram said when I was a young boy he said we thought we all knew how to swim we go down to that old muddy Lake we pull the nail our overalls drop we get in that muddy pool and we start look at me I'm swimming he said what we're doing splashing more water out of the pond he said but when later he said when I learned to stroke when I learned how to swim it wasn't splashing it wasn't this and that you see in his early Ministry look at me I'll tell you what I'm going to pray for people I'm going to stay four or six days I'm not even going to leave the pulpit I'm going to stay here I'm going to pray and tell everybody until there was thousands upon thousands and you know what it did it got him a nervous breakdown he had to go off the ministry for 18 months you see it's not it's not trying to pray for everybody I'm I'm bringing this somewhere now I the Apostle Paul said look I want to take you un to Perfection I want to go beyond all this laying on of hands and of water baptism and all of this stuff I want to go onto something hard far higher I want you to understand that's what the Apostle Paul was doing that's why he was hard to be misunderstood he is so easily to be misunderstood because he's trying to get the people to understand it's by faith I want to go beyond these things and he said and we'll do it if God will permit loud you see in church age page 339 he quotes revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he is declared to a Servants of prophets there it is he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet from after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is far from organization education in the world of religion as John the Baptist and of Elijah of old and he will hear only from God he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece as he and it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day watch this God's messenger he'll bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works somebody say hallelujah hallelujah change of ministry if there is a change of ministry there's got to be a change of administration you understand it now watch this brother Braham said and we would see Jesus 1962 the levitical priesthood ceased at the death of the Lord Jesus levitical priesthood that was ordained of God set up by Moses himself it ceased at the death of the Lord Jesus now we live in the mezic priesthood Christ now we still are not without AUM Thum this is it now the Bible amen God changed the ministry with a new Administration watch this though it's the same Ministry remember I gave you the quote brother brm said I thought he'd change the ministry he said no no the ministry is the same but he changes the man with the ministry okay now I want to give you a graph here I want to show you to show you something here look at this left side the old priesthood the litical priesthood and the ironic priesthood the temple was a building made with hands but but when it changes the temple is the body of the New Covenant Believers in Christ know you not that you are the temple so watch it changing watch same Ministry new Administration so the old sacrifice was an animal the final sacrifice was Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb the offerings before in the Old Testament were animals but the blood of bulls and goats does not do away with sin so now the offerings are now presenting ourselves as living sacrifices tithing and offering and a sacrifice of praise there was access in the Old Testament to the holy of holies was restricted to the high priest alone once a year here actually access to the holy h of holies is available to all believers wow see the change prayers were prayed at the temple in the name of the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but when it changes prayers are prayed in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the priesthood was after the order of Aaron but the priesthood has changed now after the order of M Jesus who is our high priest amen oh my 1 Corinthians 2 musicians have you come my my myk you Lord I'm going to go a little bit further got lay a foundation for our next service 1 Corinthians 2: 12 through1 13 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so when we look at the change of administration we have to bring it down to our our day we have to see the ministry it continues but it changes Administration now a lot of us read Revelations 10 1-7 and we don't look at the change of administration but I'm going to show you so we're going to follow along in scripture Revelations 10 7-1 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound now brother Bram said not when he starts his ministry not in the first and second pull but he said when that third pull Ministry begins to sound and the revealing of the son of man the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants of prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the seat and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and I said unto him please oh kind Angel would you kindly give me the book remember in Revelations chap 5 no one's worthy to take the book nor to look there on no one in heaven and Earth found worthy but now in Revelations 10 give me the book give me that little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up so he had this book in his hand he said give me the little book and he said okay you take it now you eat it don't you take these tapes and books and this revealed word of the hour and put it on a shelf you read it you assimilated you listen you go home and you listen to those tapes tapes do not replace going to church you listen to the tapes so that when you come to church CH that I'll be saying what he said cuz you you'll be saying I heard that on tape that's nothing but the truth give me the little book take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter he said said unto me thou now watch this before it was the prophecy of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound now there's another sounding do you understand the administration changes will the bride have a Ministry yeah yeah sure uhhuh it's going on now it's called the message of the hour thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations tongues and Kings no longer one Ministry it's a multi-member Ministry the change of ministry must bring with it a new Administration that's what's going on right now that third poll faith is that super sense it's the revealing of the son son of a man let me show you let me go on just a little bit in Matthew chapter 15 verses 21- 28 then Jesus went then and departed in the coast of Ty and siden behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him now she's from Canaan she's a gentile she is not Jew are we [Music] together she Cried unto him have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil she at least recognized it was a spirit today we call it all well they got PTSD they got uh some kind of whatever we put doctor names to it's a devil have mercy on me thou son of David now she's coming to him as a Jew son of David to her he's not son of David but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away she cries after us but he answered said I am not sent but under the lost sheep of the House of Israel wow I got nothing to do with this [Music] woman then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me Lord not thou son of David Lord she's coming as a gentile now Lord would you help me and he answered it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee as thou will you see the Gentile who touched me who touched me she didn't touch him physically she's touching him by [Music] faith understand this she was catching the son of man Ministry in Jesus Christ she was a gentile reaching out she's catching something now let me show you the comparison now Jew Gentile go to Mark 5 watch this Mark 5: 211 and 34 and when Jesus passed over again by ship under the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh Under the Sea behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw him he he fell at his feet so gyrus is from a synagogue so he's a what he's a Jew right and besought him greatly my daughter lith at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her remember brother brm said it's a Jewish custom to have hands laid on you it's what he said you all know that we've seen the quotes that she might be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and among people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman hears somebody else coming he's on his way to the home of gyrus there was a woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years and has suffered many things with many Physicians had spent all she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse and when she heard of Jesus she came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said watch this power of spoken word watch watch what she's doing she says if I may touch but his clothes I shall be healed I shall be whole and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself virtue at gone out of him turned about under the press and said who touched my clothes now wait just a second I'm going to stop here and I'm going to ask you guys something I thought he's all all knowing I thought he knows the secrets and intents of the heart why would he say who touched my clothes as though he couldn't find out as though he didn't you know what he's getting all of them to understand somebody has touched me here and it's different virtue has gone out of me who touched my clothes I want to ask you when God came down in the cool of the evening and was seeking Adam and Eve and they had sinned and they were run and hiding and and and God came down and he walked among the garden there Adam where are you wait a second it don't make sense of God who's all knowing would ask where are you Adam he's asking Adam Adam what are you doing why are you under this condition did you eat of that tree that I told you not to understand when he says who has touched my clothes he knows who touching me he's just wanting them to confess and for the rest of them to catch that somebody touched him different I'm going to build on this for our next service and a woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith has made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy [Music] plague I'm going to stop with this last verse but here I'm going to launch out on my next service I want all of you to understand this Psalms 107: 19 and 20 then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their distrs what did he send word I want you to understand that when he sent the word and you catch a revelation of that revealed word what is it it's a revealing of the son of man when you catch that guess what there's Deliverance there's healing huh there's adoption all of this what is it it's a revealing to you who is this brother renom are you the son of man are you the one he lived so Godly before the people some of them mistook him for Jesus Christ how about you have you lived so Godly before people said are you him he said no I'm an example of the example I'm a son of man revealing to you the son of man it was not William brandom it was not his message I I got into a a talk a nice discussion with Joseph Brenan one day okay because he said hey we have a copyright on this message I said how do you copyright what's God's amen I said if this was your daddy's message you have every right to every royalty and I said copyright it and then charge everybody to get it I said how do you copyright the word of God I said your daddy said I got no more to do with this message than nothing I just happen to be the one who yields myself it's no longer my voice it's his voice I said so change the name from voice of God it's not voice of God it's voice of William brandham and you got every right to every royalty of everything he ever preached I said but I'll tell you what this message was not his amen amen who was it revealing of the son of man when you listen to them tapes you're not listening to the prophet oh there are some that just hear hear his voice and that's it and go no further some get offended and go away from it why this man takes too much authority to himself uhhuh go ahead go does this offend you you see we're we're we're down here now saints of God listen we're not here trying to go and get large groups of people no one's going to get taken off here and there but you know what it's amazing thing every time one leaves it seems like two more come I'm thinking oh God here we are at the end time he said who touched [Music] me do you know that while the word is yet being preached you can sit right there and be healed amen brother Rand said I'm going to give you the quotes later you go read them yourselves he said for everyone that comes up here into a prayer line everyone that has discernment up here he said it's a 50 to1 Rao for everyone that comes up here there's 50 out there then in another place he says 10 to one ratio but he says you don't need to come up here amen he said you can sit right there in fact he said you sir he said you yeah you stand up he said I see God dealing with you he said you're crying this and this and said what was it and you and the woman over here he said for everyone that came up here he said you don't need me to lay hands on you he said there just needs to be a revealing of the son of man and when you understand it's not me he said you think you're coming up here and it's me laying hands on you no he said I'm just a son of man amen he said but when you catch the revealing of the the son of man he said right there in your seat saints of God if you'll start catching that Revelation this wasn't William Brandon wasn't his message sorry wasn't his message God gave him this message and he was sent to a bride huh he was sent to people that could not be shook off thank you Lord no uh you can be tripped up once in a while you might take a detour but we got GPS system I got GPS inside of me it's God's positioning C system right oh I make a detour now and then huh but the destination never changes when you put hey when you put your GPS on in the destination there are times you make wrong turns or there's this and that or a road closure it's not on your GPS and all of a sudden it uh you know and then you see that wheel what does it doing recalculating okay at the next Street turn right and you're talking to your wife you go pass it recalculating oh you thought you would do this and that recalculating how many times has your GPS recalculated for you mine's on a daily basis recalculating but thank God my destination never changes guess what yeah give him praise this morning let's Stand Together come on yeah guess what

and Kentucky two different but anyway he comes to Hatty Wright's house and and he says this is the first time the third pole is on human beings Now understand that the third pole is sovereignty of God it wasn't done in a church it wasn't in a prayer line no it was just a circumstance what have you have need of squirrels he said I shot the squirrels and guess what I ate them he did he said it wasn't a vision they were there I ate them hadie writes here's what brother Bram has to say and she speaks with her voice that's nothing but the [Music] truth it so pleased God that all a sudden he said thus sayith the Lord tell hadie right to speak the word now she's speaking it you understand but the whole thing if you go back and listen to the tape brother Bram said oh God oh God does this show you're moving from the second pull to the third is this what the change of ministry is all about oh God help me to be more consecrated and you know what he does at the end of the service he said I'm not having a prayer line I'm having a time of consecration he said I think it's time for all of us to reconsecrate our life before God he said to get more sincere to get more in love with God isn't that all of your desire amen amen if you want more of God in your life get more sincere get more consecrated ask God God come do these things in my life Just Surrender you can do it right now you don't
