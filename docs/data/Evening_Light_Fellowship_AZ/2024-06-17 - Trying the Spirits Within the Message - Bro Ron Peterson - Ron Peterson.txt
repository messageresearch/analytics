people I've got some things on my heart this morning I need God to give me wisdom Grace to be able to deliver it and then for you to receive it because we're in a we're in an age where the scripture says that seducers will wax worse and worse there'll be false prophets false teachers arise there be Grievous wolves come in among the Sheep not sparing the flock God give us wisdom and discernment on the things that are happening around us let's sing this song now as we worship him yes be only [Music] be all things are possible [Music] only only me all things are [Music] possible let's sing Lord I believe and I believe Lord I believe all things are possible [Music] Lord [Music] I Lord I believe Lord [Music] I all things are possible Lord I believe heavenly father I lay my hands upon your Holy Scripture and father we know that this is a closed book it is not for every eye to see though if you have education you can read but except that God give us the Revelation beyond that ability of reading we would miss what you have us to to see therefore father anoint us with the isv of the Holy Spirit Come and speak to our hearts touch Our Lives set every captive free those that are sick may you heal them those that are bound may they be set free those that are discouraged may they be encouraged father each and every one your word will go forth and it will not return void but it shall accomplish father we thank you we praise you for the victory before the battle even in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you thank you musicians each and everyone God bless you it's just remain standing turn with me to the book of Hebrews chapter 5 Hebrews chapter 5 and we'll read verses 11-4 I'm going to put these glasses on to help me to see here so yeah yeah okay Hebrews 5:1 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oral Les of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of views you catch that who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning turn with me if you would to the book of First John chapter 4 then we'll go to Revelation Chapter 2 1 John 4 and we'll read just the first verse beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world turn with me to Revelation 2 and verse two I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience how thou can not hear them excuse me how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and Hast found them Liars pretty harsh words but they are true nonetheless may God add the blessing to his word this morning I want to speak to you this may be a two or three-part series we'll see how the Lord leads but I want to title the sermon this morning trying the spirits within the message trying the spirits within the message and I want to take as a subject this morning of the Discerning of Spirits it's a quite a deep subject and it's something that each one of you are going to have to do God requires this of each one of you not only to get Revelation but have discernment of what's being said and then the scripture says to try the spirits to see whether they're of God I want to ask you how do you try the spirit it is by the word so you do not try them by the anointing you do not try them by the signs and wonders following them you do not TR you only try them by the word of God that is our absolute that is the irum Thum of today you do not try them on how well they can quote the scripture nor do you try them on how anointed their Ministries are nor by the signs that follow but you try their lives and see if how they live matches up to the word of God or not there are many people that tell you oh I'm a Christian but watch their life Jesus said they honth me with their lips but their hearts be far from me in vain do they worship me I want all of you to start use by by reason of use start Discerning Spirits Amen brother Brenham says things I don't care how much a person will um say they're a holy ghost filled Christian he said watch the fruits in their lives it'll tell you whether or not they have the Holy Spirit because the holy spirit will say Amen to all the word and not just verbally but it will apply the word in the life so the life will manifest what the holy spirit's revealing amen Amen brother Ram said If a woman still cuts her hair and the Bible says that a woman should not cut her hair says she cannot have the Holy Spirit is that clear you can't get any more clearer than that brother Bram said look he said what would make a young girl cut her hair he says an ungodly evil spirit of the end time yes sir he because be because her hair is given to her for her glory yes sir and he said if she cuts her hair she dishonors her head which is Christ amen so brother Brandon began to show us things start Discerning he says oh my how that one Pastor said why my wife is she's she's a real Saint and he said oh my she came up there and uh you know he says I looked at her and she wasn't dressed right her hair was chopped off and different things and he began to look and he said looks more like she's a haint than she is a saint cuz she ain't got it now what what was he doing he's not trying to be smart he's not trying to be judgmental he's looking at a tree by its fruit now I'm not one of these guys who can go and look at citrus trees and until it bears fruit is it a lemon tree is it a grapefruit is it an orange tree I don't know but I will know you give a few months down the road and I look and I see an orange Ah that's an orange tree how do I know it's orange it's got orange fruit even Brother David McGary and I years ago and he was preaching and he says if it swims like a duck if it quacks like a duck if it flies like a duck and you know duck duck duck he says what is it it's a duck now that may sound a little funny but it's true and so you recognize everything by characteristics so you start Discerning the spirits that are are within the church and I want to clarify this because much of the time you have certain quotes that are quoted by many of the ministers within the message but they fail they overemphasize certain parts of that quote and leave off the rest now Paul said I don't want to shun to declare any of the word of God to you in other words I want to tell you the whole truth amen and um so let's take this one quote and dissect it for just a moment so that you understand the direction in which I'm taking this this is the church age book page 15 paragraph 3 now remember this that Christ is the in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church now notice that if the people get the true revelation of the true church so there's a true church and a true Revelation but if that is true there is also a false church with false Revelation okay so if the true church gets a true Revelation okay um of the chur and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the now here's the point I'm I'm making here's where you need to start Discerning stuff everything the Glitters Is Not Gold just because they hang a shingle out Malachi 4 Revelations 107 and they say they believe the message how often we Embrace everybody we bring everybody right into the circle yeah brother right on brother you believe this message well I want you to understand that not everything and everybody that says they believes this message say only what that Prophet said brother Bram said I can tell you that many of those who go out and began to preach he said they begin to add to and take away from the word of God and the word of God no longer becomes pure it becomes hybrid and when it does it no longer has the strength to bring forth of its own kind so now watch here's where the point I'm getting to if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits say two two Spirits every Revival brings forth what twins amen it's amazing how many people I go to a restaurant I go we had a physical therapist coming to my house yesterday said do I know you looking at me she came to do physical therapy for Sandy on her arm do you do I know you I said no no yeah I know you I said well you probably know my twin brother Don oh yeah yeah every Revival brings forth twins they look alike within the framework of the church so we're not talking about Catholic we're not talking about Lutheran Pentecostal within somebody say within that's within the framework of the Church of the Christian church and by God's spirit what is it what do you do with God's spirit discern so now here here we're talking about you get a true revelation of the true church and you begin to see two Spirits were working within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit you discern so you first catch something by discernment and the Bible excuse me the message says and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen amen now a lot of times you see different ones stating that Satan is a defeated enemy and he is but you better know spiritual warfare because you will meet him you will have to have spiritual warfare and you'll have to put on the whole armor of God and you better start Discerning spirits within the framework of the church don't Embrace anybody and everybody and everything try the spirits and see whether or not they are of God now brother Brenham says I'm going to tell you some of these things by the experience that he went through now let me give you an example and I'm going to ask you a question the loud you see in church age began in what year 1906 why did he choose 1906 ausa street because the Holy Spirit remember the oneeyed black man brother Seymour I think it was in isusa Street and they begin to call on the Lord begin to ask God the the the Holy Spirit fell in isusa Street and it was a great Revival gifts and and tongues and prophecies and all kinds of stuff and man it just went like like wildfire so 1906 is when loud eia started and it started because of a movement of the Holy Spirit and brother Brenan was born in what year 1909 so the spirit was already anointing an age and people and gifts and Ministries before he even became a preacher so now when God begins to give him a word because he's the angel to the Church of leasa are we together on that so now all of this teaching about anointings and gifts and callings and doing God a service all of these things the prophet of God has to now wean us away from all of the things that we had been taught okay and when he put the church in order when he began to actually have accountability for gifts and prophecies he ye my people I will bless you and on and on and and tongues and interpretation and and while he's yet speaking how many times have you heard a service brother Bram is preaching even in one one tape uh brother bram's going in and then Here Comes an interpretation and a man probably the host Pastor excuse EXC me excuse me brother brenham's not done yet you see that Discerning of spirits but many people are not taught correctly they just went ahead and brother BR said yes brandom Tabernacle I'd let you play with the gifts now for over 20 years I'm going to set them in order now you got a gift of tongues I want you to come before church in the back room sit down with we got those who got interpretation of tongues and we got those who are who have got Discerning spirits and word of knowledge and we got Elders who will judge us so you want to speak in tongues you want to interpret it and you write it down and he says and then you got three to judge it is this do you feel you're an elder in the church do you feel yes sir I that was thus sayith the Lord so then you go ahead and you read it now remember brother Bram said a a tongues an interpretation brings a prophecy and a prophecy is what it's not well-wishing it's not repeating scripture it's not saying oh if you will seek the Lord I will bless you if you do this I will no we know that prophecy is for telling a future event don't go home by way of I17 this evening because there's going to be a terrible wreck and people will lose their lives okay and so do believe that and so they would sign it and so they read it but he says now what happens if it doesn't come to pass there's no reck he said now for he that spoke in tongues he that interpreted it and the three Elders that signed to it you know what sit down cuz you've got a false Spirit among you cuz you said God said it and he and it didn't come to pass now when brother Brenham began to set the gifts in order guess what nobody wanted to be judged because who who Who's going to judge me well you going to make me step down yes sir why CU you got a false Spirit on you the Bible says try the spirits and see whether or not they are of God so now brother Brenham now comes comes in as a missionary baptist he's not really been around much of a what is called a Pentecostal movement and he stops somewhere I think in Mishiwaka somewhere and there's a revival going on he goes in there and wow my he said if I ever saw people happy about what they believe that impressed him first people should be able to see that we enjoy going to church cuz if we don't have or Make a Joyful Noise on the Lord who's going to want what you got when we all get to heaven what a day yeah you ain't happy about nothing one time you get happy is let's stand the service is over you're dismissed Hallelujah Resurrection you come back to life CU you slept amen okay so now brother Brenham is there in that eting you get tongues and interpretation and wow he is saying this is amazing these are angels so now he's got a gift in the hand is that correct God giv gift lays his hand on somebody and he could tell Oh my he said I talked to the first one shook his hand if I ever met a true Christian that was him man you know love God he could tell by the sincerity and everything and then he said I went and talked to the other man I I shook his hand he said oh my he's married to a blond-haired woman got or a blackheaded and got children by a blond-headed woman oh now now oh wait just a second now he's Discerning spirits but he says I thought I was among Angels now I may be among Devils God you need to help me to understand because I don't understand I know the rain falls on the just and the unjust and so now he goes a prophet goes uh and he seeks God and he gets in his cave he's been in the cave for a few days he's asking God what is about all this anointing he said I'm out on my uh a little tree uh falling over trunk and he says there I'm reading my Bible and he says and I set it down for a moment to just kind of meditate and the wind blew it over to Hebrews 11 he said now that's strange I was wasn't reading Hebrews 11 so he takes his Bible goes back puts it down the wind blows it again is that Supernatural and it happens a couple times until they realize okay God are you trying to show me something and he says does not the rain fall on the just and the unjust both the cockle bur and the r and the wheat raise up and praise the Lord so he says look oh my there's where brother Brenham takes a sermon called the anointed ones of the end time and he says they are genuinely anointed of the Holy Spirit they are activating gifts of the Spirit but he says in wrong seed now that's amazing now I remember the first several times that I heard the anointed ones at the end time I thought that he would say the anointing is false it's false anointing on false seed no he said genuine anointing genuine Holy Spirit falling upon even nonseed activating gifts of the Spirit he said but watch the control tower Christ is not sitting on the control tower therefore they could activate the gifts of the Spirit for there are gifts of the Spirit speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues on on and on huh those are the gifts of the Spirit do you know Caiaphas prophesied wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost nor did he not see Christ but he prophesied I want you to understand a lot of times these gifts of the Spirit and I want to ask you a question the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance you had a gift if you got a gift in your life right now you've always had it but what happened is you come to the knowledge you got it I had a friend of mine tell me he said I used to I was a bartender before I got converted he said men had come to my bar and they'd sit down and I never would ask them what is it you want and he says I would mix their drink set it in front of them and they said how did you know what he said I don't know I just knew they wanted Whiskey and Rye or whatever some kind of mixed drink and he says brother Brenham said you had that gift before you got converted he said now don't play around with it because it's not 100% has a margin of in it now so I'm saying all of that to bring us now to watch what brother Brenham says by experience I'm going to do some reading here let me put these glasses back on so I can read it a little bit better lotan Church age page 347 then there is all this talk about the gelia supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are thinking that we are in theid of a great Revival Revival is over America had her last chance in 1957 now the tongues are God's sign of impending disaster look at that everybody's talking about talking in tongues brother Bram said tongues is not for the believer it's for the unbeliever and he says you know what it's a sign of impending disaster even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at B Bel sher's Feast then brother B quotes Matthew 7:22 and 23 depart from me ye that work iniquity I never knew you Jesus said they were workers of iniquity now what is Iniquity knowing what's right and not doing it you can know what what's right and not do it the Bible says be not hearers only but doers of the word you can get a man that can come and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophesy coming forth and all manner of the Supernatural and the people will gather around him and swear that he is of the Lord even though he's actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin the only answer they have is the absolutely unbiblical answer of well he gets results so he must be of God how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of God and the poor poverty stricken ones don't even know it God help us then to have spiritual discernment brother Brenham says false prophets and false teachers will arise he says watch seducers will wax worse and worse they it will come into the church now usually it always happens after the messenger goes off the scene because it gets much worse but it was happening with him here was already happening so I want to ask you after God sends a messenger with his word every generation gets a little bit uh more starchy a little bit less away from the fire Revival and after about the fourth generation he said you have to Resto the fire again because the fire is about ready to go out so you have to understand we're fighting things now right now that we've never faced before because now different ones are rising up just like it did in the first church age amen now here's resume of the church Ages page 377 this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it will be as it was to the age in which the true church would return to bring the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must be of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believer sensed this and their Spirits began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was then believed this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter Reign can come only after the former Reign which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rign had not come now watch the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turned the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostals fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quickening unto the rapture had not come in it watch this in it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seem to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines built their fences as every other group ahead of them did now I want you to understand what they do they organize brother BM said this message will never denominate but I'm going to shock you there are people in the message that have denominated they have organized it's us for and no more it's us if you don't believe us you don't believe our church you're out of here and next thing you know it you can talk to them and you get the feeling from them you start Discerning their spirit and you feel like it's them and us it's not us together they make you feel like well it's you and we're not United unscriptural doctrines brings Division and fences pretty soon you can't Fellowship one with another why well you don't see it just exactly like I do I'm sick of that I am I'm so sick of the politics within the message really and you know who's the worst ministers yeah yeah it is the truth and I'm sorry to say that but it is the truth and I can understand why some just say I'm staying home and just listening to a tape I understand some of that technology that understanding I say yeah I'm because you know what but just because you have the bad ones don't throw the baby out with the bathwater there are true God sent God called God ordained Ministry am you know who may close your door message Believers you know you know who may take away you going to church I'm I'm going to tell you something I was at brandom Tabernacle here three weeks ago I getting a tour of the Tabernacle and you talk about a sad situation here the church which was the home Church of the prophet of God where he stored up spiritual food where the moving of God where the angel rode on the back wall On and On signs and wonders everywhere you have to get permission for somebody to open the door come in and you open it's just a museum there's nobody preaching and in order to go to church to pray you have to sign up online and you can't pray out loud it's ridiculous and so this brother is giving us a a little tour and he says you know what I feel sorry for you people that go to church excuse me yeah I feel sorry for you people that go to church cuz we're in church all the time you know what you go to church two hours Sunday two two hours this is what he said two hours Sunday you go to church two hours Sunday evening and two hours Wednesday night we're in church 247 our home is our church I want to ask you is that brother bren's teaching and yet they closed the doors of Brenham Tabernacle four years ago they closed the doors to voice of God God recorded you know they don't print they don't make tapes and they don't make the tablet no more and so brother Daniel Andes him and Shannon took us by there said you want to okay so anyway well let me go back to what the brother said there because he said you you people you know you have only a couple times a week that you and we're here in church you know 247 I said do you think you will ever open the doors again he said no he said Brother Joseph brandham said the best thing that ever happened to the message was covid-19 well I just beg to differ with you covid-19 was not the best thing but what his Viewpoint is cause you to stay home isolate and to stay home and press play what are your kids going to to do if you do that your kids are going to fellowship with somebody yeah yeah and so anyway he said we're probably never you know it says on there they're they've been closed for remodeling how long does it take there ain't nobody working there's no remodel work going on so Daniel took us by Daniel Andes took us by voice of God so we went there and we parked right in front there wasn't nobody there a couple cars on the side of the building I've never been there I have not been to Jeffersonville since 1987 wow 87 I've never been there since that time so you know I come they go in front of the voice of God and they got a little Lake out front how many of you ever been by the the new building raise your hand a few of you yeah so we by get a little Lake out front sign on there no fishing I asked Daniel do you have a fishing rod I said no this is here's the carnality of brother Ron I said if you got a fishing rod I want you to take a picture of me fishing in this Lake next to the sign and I'm going to send it to Brother Joseph and I know he's going to laugh I'm not trying to be a rebellious no it's funny no no fishing anyway so we go to the front door and it's got a sign on there due to moding this place is closed okay so I'm I walk up I wanted to take a close-up picture of closed right and all a sudden the door come open and the sister oh brother Peterson how are you I haven't seen you yes brother Peterson uh the office in Germany yes and on oh God bless you and they said well you know uh uh brother Daniel said well can we come in yeah you can come into the fora there's just a few people here and and everything and so we went there and they've got the the the old uh Pulpit of brother Brenham there and uh they got it they got a um a railing and they don't want anybody to go beyond the railing or go up there or touch it or stand behind it and so anyway even in the Tabernacle the brother who gave us the tour Daniel brother Daniel Andy asked can brother Ron sit in brother ROM's chair in his office oh no no no no we I said I don't I've sat in a chair before I don't need to sit in a chair again well excuse me he said uh yeah maybe uh it would be a great blessing for you to just okay so Sandy and I we got our picture and and everything but he says uh when we go out into the sanctuary nobody goes behind the pulpit because we don't want anybody you know okay no problem sints of God listen here's my can I speak my heart I was heartbroken there's there's nobody there there's nobody going to church there's nobody hearing the word you stay home and press play brother Ram says you can't wait for those doors to be open here's what's nice about a living Ministry a god ordained God sent because while he's preaching the whole holy spirit is speaking to his heart and the word is Discerning and somebody's sitting right there and how many times have you been in church and God gave you a word because it was something you were praying about or a spirit bothering you and all of a sudden the spirit speaks through that Minister and you knew that was for me man amen who told you brother Ron nobody told me he told me thank God for alive ordain God send Ministry amen become a museum brother BM said one day they'll lock the doors make it a storehouse you ever been into a a house an old building or something it's got that musty smell you walk in that's how the Tabernacle my heart heart was broken I thought oh God is that would I want to take my youth and just view a museum God is this what the message is coming down to you just close the doors everybody go home you stay in your house nobody fellowship with one another a nickan spirit now watch start Discerning spirits discern Spirits try the spirit and see a nickan spirit what does it do it divides and conquers so anything that divides us and causes us not to be able to have Fellowship is not a Godly Spirit hey let the chips fall where they may I am here to tell you the truth and I'm not trying to be a pastor out here on the internet I'm not trying to Pastor anybody else's sheep I'm telling my sheep because God has ordained me to this church and therefore I have a right to say what I feel over my Pulpit somebody say Amen thank you in the sermon sir we would see Jesus let's go on but my precious brother you have some poor spiritual discernment that's where the church is what the church is missing today is that spiritual discernment to see what God's are doing and they took and they look way over the top of something here that's going on right here and it'll be passed before you know it so I want to speak on this subject because each one of you are going to face this and it's going to affect you it will affect you it will anoint somebody around you and make perhaps them to believe it and guess what they will all of a sudden split away from you and you'll find you have no more Fellowship together though you quote believe the same message have you ever experienced that if you have it hang on cuz you will there is a spiritual battle going on we fight not against flesh and blood if you are unaware of spiritual warfare if you fail to use your spiritual discernment you will be vulnerable and susceptible to influence of demonic Powers amen that's true you will be susceptible to to false Doctrine and false teachers you will be susceptible to evil spirits by sowing of Discord among the Brethren which causes Division and roots of bitterness the Bible tells us to mark them which cause division among you amen God help us to have discernment of spirits to discern in Greek diaro what does it mean to separate to make a distinction to discriminate to learn by discrimination to give judgment to decide a dispute it also means to contend for the truth to discern contend for the truth I know many of you are good Christian people we're trying to live the right way according to the word of God but you have got got to start using spiritual discernment when it comes to the word of God that's why the scripture says try the spirits to see whether or not they are of God use to spiritual discernment 2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds he gives you a little smiling Emoji there casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen Ephesians 6: 10-2 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places do you know churches carry Spirits do you know people carry Spirits do you know Ministries carry spirits I'm going to give you some quotes here but let me just give you an example you parents be careful who you let your children hang around because you might have good Godly kids let them hang around a bunch of rebels and watch when they come home who you've been hanging around with what' they do they picked up a spirit oh I just I'm just going over to Johnny's house I've just gone over to go see Susie what was it a spirit picked up a spirit huh we got to start Discerning Spirits it's it's okay I want you to I want you to listen it's okay that we don't get jumping and shouting because this ain't no jumping and shouting service right now it may be later it might save your life might save your family might save your kids okay cuz you got to start Discerning now we're going to show you brother brim says here God keeps his word 57 now for a little context to go back to get a background to the things I want to say in reason I've always tried to say stay on the Bible I went into churches many times amen I went in the churches many times he talking about experience now brother Freddy he's taking his experience experience matching it to the word of God and he goes into churches many times watch what he says just so that you get a little general picture I've went into churches and you watch this you go into a church and you'll find usually the way that Pastor acts that's the way the congregation will act see I believe they get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit sometimes what' he say you might get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit watch how the pastor acts absolutely take a real good woman marry her to a no noac account man he'll either become a gentleman or she'll become a no account see you just take one another's Spirit you do birds of a feather flock together he speaking from experience now God keeps his word brother Bren I'm going to read the ital or the highlighted I have went into churches and I say this re with reverence now I find that many times in the churches I believe people get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit you go into a church and watch where the pastor maybe jerks his head the whole congregation will do it you go into a church where the pastor says he's got oil running from his hand hands the first saying you know the whole company believes that and they have it going to a church where there's a lot of dancing and jumping and running around I'm not condemning these things I'm just speaking as an observation to present a point to you if you get a pastor that's very emotional the whole congregation will be emotional you get a pastor that's starch and stiff and the whole congregation will be just like brother Ron I certainly don't want to be starch and stiffy but I know this the older I get the more stiff and anyway I I I'm not making a joke out of it this is true he says I'm I'm making a point here by observation okay I believe you receive each other's spirit now brother Bram says in the sermon sermon choosing a bride watch this talk about choosing a church the same applies to choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you're fellowshipping in remember churches carry a spirit you guys catch that church carry the spirit now I don't want to be critical I realize I'm an old man I got to leave here one of these days I got to answer at the day of judgment for what I say tonight or any other time and I therefore I got to be dead Earnest and truly convicted but you go into a church and you watch the behavior of that church you just watch the pastor a while and you usually find that the church acts like the pastor sometimes I wonder if we don't get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit you get to a place where a pastor is real radical and carrying on you find a congregation the same way I'll bring you to a church where I see the pastor stand jerk his head back and forth you watch the congregation they do the same thing you take a pastor just gulp down anything usually the church would do the same thing so if I was choosing a church I'd choose a genuine fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church I choosing one to put my family in amen you know I've been concerned now for probably 15 years of seeing the direction some of the ministry are taking this message concerns me and it's affecting mostly the youth because youth are young they're vulnerable they don't know they haven't been there done that I believe that some are getting off into fanatical elements and emotions and Sensations and causing all of that to be called the Holy Ghost right it is a holy ghost anointing you understand that but what they're doing exactly as Pentecost where did Pentecost make their mistake brother brand preaches a sermon where I believe Pentecost failed why I'm against organized religion why we are not a denomination where did Pentecost fail they took some truths and made this this is the initial evidence what was the initial evidence speaking in tongu if you don't speak in tongues you don't got it then was the Apostle Paul wrong to say do all speak with tongues do all prophesy do all have the gifts of healing Now understand that you got all of this stuff that's called this great movement the Holy Spirit going and all of the many of the young people are just taking it in why because you watch the way the minister is acting they're going to act the same way hallelujah praise be to God now I have to be careful because you may think I'm trying to imitate somebody God forbid no and every church is Sovereign amen that's right I don't want everybody to be like me no way but watch pretty soon they start just impersonating one another and if you had the Holy Ghost praise God he would speak in tongues if you had the Holy Ghost the next thing you know putting all these conditions out here instead of you starchy stiff you loudy aan and going on and on next thing you know you're you're judging the other people that are not acting the way you act and pretty soon it's a division it's Us and Them did Brother Brenham ever do that brother Brenham came to unite this bride together around the word hallelujah it wasn't he says I'm going to give you some quotes here in just a second because this is important because you got to have spiritual discernment and by reason of use you need to exercise it what happens to muscles if you put it in a cast some of you that that work in a hospital what happens it atrophies oh oh oh oh don't move it don't move it a nothing wrong your arm ain't broke it's healed up yeah but I I I haven't moved it in months well that's the same way with your atrophied discernment you've not used discernment in years you just swallow anything believe anything surf every internet preacher in the message and go from one sermon to the next and the next thing you know now Hey listen I'm just telling cuz one time I told you stay away from that and everything and and people thought I was forbidding them no you want to you go ahead but you better discern the spirit next thing you know you'll be acting just like they do huh now I want to ask you when the holy spirit moves and some of the greatest anointings in the prophet's Ministry said look beyond all the healings beyond all the signs and all of that he said this week has been the climax of my life talking about the opening of the seals I want to ask you how are they acting while he's preaching how was he preaching quietly now he says there in questions and answers between the six and seven seal now I know you don't get it I know you're not supposed to get it yeah but brother Ram aren't we no no no I know you're not getting it he said just stay simple yeah but brother no just stay simple see the next thing is hey I tell you what if you ain't catching what I'm telling you something's wrong with you you need to get into the next thing you know you get into the spirit of what he's saying and you're siding with that and next thinging you know he's pulling you out and you didn't even know it now I want to ask you when it's the revelation of the word that stimulates you it's okay to say Amen it's okay to stand up and shout it's okay to do that you have I'm just letting you know it's okay to do that but now if the end of the sermon I'm done and now we get a a minister or excuse me a song leader to get up here um and you have to have certain songs that got a little bit of a rock and roll huh uh what's the name of one of the songs here I wrote it down I got a fire shut up in my bones I got a fire come on now shut up in my bone I'm Pentecostal I'm not ashamed I'm Pentecost next thing you know everybody hallelujah amen heads are shaking people are twirling Hallelujah I'm not against an emotion but I'm not here to put theot motion before the word cuz I'm going to show you some quotes cuz you better start Discerning Spirits cuz you might get one another Spirit just because I'm up here dancing and I'm running around and I'm shouting and I might be speaking with tongues why don't you do it come on up here brother I tell you what Brian if you was really Holy Ghost filled you be up here and you and I be dancing up here well pretty soon what I do is I put it on you you got to do what I got to do I don't need you to IM imitate impersonate do anything when the holy spirit moves and he really reveals something to you sometimes it's a still Small Voice it's not all kinds of it's not the earthquake it's not the Thunder the lightning but it's still Small Voice not against emotion I love emotion I think brother R hey let's let's say the quote brother Ram said a a a religion without emotion is dead you might as well bury it so I don't want you to just sit there like fossilized logs no I'm just doing a teaching so when you do a teaching it's different than when you're really preaching but I'm teaching you I'm asking you use discernment I've been in meetings I've seen some of the most emotional Sensational meetings I had ever been in I I'll be honest with you it was seven Thunders it was over in hangle Hof Belgium and of course you know brother Coleman he's passed on he was up there and you talk about you talk about jumping and sh shouting you talk about people getting excited hallelujah praise God this is a ceiling time be sealed of God and do like this and 50 60 people all of them all of them pass out I said this is the sealing time be sealed of God and you've got young people that are sitting there I want the Holy Ghost I want to be sealed to the day of my Redemption and I I want and they see other people falling what do you you going to do when I say be sealed of God you're going to fall and man I tell you what there was people jumping and I'm sitting there I'm sitting there brother Robert and everybody is up everybody jumping and shouting around I'm looking and a and a brother is right next to me you ever heard that expression you know what I thought he was saying M I thought he was is saying you're Shu Shu you're sitting in your seat you Shu I started to get offended then later I found out that's just an expression okay and all this then a sister about four chairs away from me screaming like she's getting murdered I want to ask you hey hey excuse me I'm not trying to be funny the Holy Spirit doesn't scare little children doesn't it's holy it's Reverend this lady I'm I'm not going to imitate but you can imagine her screaming she falls over on the ground now the holy spirit's holy is that right her long dress she got on her back and she starts bicycle pedaling in the air what does that do with her dress now will the Holy Spirit make you act Unholy brother Steve what' you say no no way Jose uhuh doesn't make you act Unholy so now the deacons are grabbing men's jackets and they grabbed my my jacket cuz I was just sitting there they came and they're wanting to try to cover her so she doesn't expose herself and her legs are kicking and she's going like this and I said oh God don't let my jacket get tore up don't let it get a devil on it I'm being honest and all of a sudden brother Bram said you ever seen somebody ridee like a snake huh well anyway my goodness she starts writhing like a snake she's from me brother Brighton from me to you and as she's coming she's coming right for me and she's kicking over chairs like this and she's coming right toward me and I thought you know what okay all right I'll just step back I moved the chairs behind me I just step back guess what she come made a 90° turn and she came after me I finally said okay you know what Satan I ain't moving and so this lady she's convulsing I'm not trying to be funny I'm telling you discern a spirit she's convulsing and God forgive me if you guys think that you know I but it was it was not good to look at she come right at my feet and she stopped I said I'm not moving and then she goes and she goes unconscious totally unconscious I want you to understand when you go to meetings sometimes you get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit brother Brenham said he's here now don't move he's weaning you away from Sensations and emotions and feelings because you know what hey you know what the song leader get up there I got fire shut up in my bones I got Fire come on man what's the matter get into this come on got fire piano player acting like Jimmy Swagger like that come on what's the matter fire yeah come on up here come on fire yeah shut up I got it in my feet I got it on my body Hallelujah the next thing you know everybody then people go to running and I'm all for running I just want to ask you s something when you get done running and when you get done shouting and you leave the church and you anointing is gone how do you live amen boy I'm concerned I had a brother text me about four or five days ago he said brother Ron what do you think the this an emotional movement that's going among especially among our young people now within the message I said first off understand that every church is Sovereign within itself they are I'm not hey you wna you want to do that you want brother Brenham said hey if you you get Arman Neville voted in as your pastor he says and he wants to preach Jehovah's Witness Doctrine that's up to you okay so understand every church is Sovereign now saints of God I realize we're not the jumping we're not the shoust we're you know Church within the message but I say this we have stable and stabilized people within this within this assembly Brother Andy manard you you've been here brother John dubsky Robert McGary some of you brotherr you've been hey this ain't the first rodeo we've been in there's a lot of come and go lots of people everybody's happy in my church some are happy to stay it's true listen but I tell you what you're you're you're you are steady people you're not one to just jump and shout and everything hey give me the word first amen let me hear the word let me something so stimulate inside here not just telling you're predestinated you ordained you no devil and hell can yeah amen glory amen and when that stimulation leaves you where are you sometimes you're defeated I'm going to read you a quote here in a second I'll show you what brother Ram said watch this now here is the sermon that I suggest I'm going to have to read about three or four paragraphs but let's follow closely it's a sermon called you must be born again you must be born again this is Brother R 1961 let me put these on so I make sure I can try to read it better now false teachers bring false births true prophets bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring a false birth the birth of churches the birth of Creeds the birth of denominations and here you are Pentecostal brother false Sensations tell a man he's got the Holy Ghost cuz he speaks with tongues I seen Devils speak with tongues pencils lay down writing unknown tongues that don't mean a thing got to be a Life by their fruit you shall know them them

in jumping shouting yeah I do false enough lead Millions is false bir I'm interested in knowing what kind of life you live on the outside of the church not here all of you got a Halo on right now you're on your best behavior you got your Sunday Best on I wonder how you dress when you go to school when you go to work do you wear clothing that you wouldn't wear a church to work Brethren how about you huh you know what people put on Instagram now what they do on their vacation and shows the Brethren wearing their shorts with several couples it's not even family and they put it on Instagram are you kidding me are you kidding me listen you want to wear your shorts and you want to do it with your your family I'm going to ask you just politely as pastor of this church don't put it on Instagram for everybody to see you understand God help us huh because if you put it on Instagram everybody's going to see it V majority of the time when people get into the spirit it's because it's it's moved by the channel of music not by the word oh you he might have preached some things got excited and everything but just wait until the song leader gets up here next thing you know singing and pretty soon yeah everybody yeah Hallelujah and jump and all over that keyboard and everybody huh yeah CU we get one another spirit I have seen people do it in a concert let me tell you yeah Rock and Roll concert I've seen it in a rock and roll concert what people will not do alone you can play the same rock music in your bedroom at the decibal level that'll let make your ears go dead and you will not act like you did when you were in the concert with 5,000 people I was there I've seen it concert after concert before I got converted yeah here's Crosby sils and Nash acoustical guitars and they sing all these songs harmonize wow amazing then close the curtain uh intermission ladies and gentlemen like this give us 15 minutes curtain closed and all of a sudden you hear and then you hear Lady ladies and gentlemen your Crosby Stills in Nash electric like this and the you think hey the the crowd went nuts huh yeah nobody stayed in their seats they all ran the aisles they all got in front I was there Hollywood the Hollywood Bowl in California I was there with the uh oh I forget even no it wasn't a Stones it's I Can See For Miles and Miles and Miles um anyway the who you Remember The Who and they I Can See For Miles and Miles and Miles like this and he takes his guitar into his the big Marshal [Music] amps the drummer throws it out into the into the lake in front of the the stadium and they destroyed their instruments everybody's going yeah this is lovely and a guy swam out in the water and got the the the drum and he's swimming back with the snare drum right and the police come got him and the people booed so much that they put pressure on the police okay okay you can have the drum what I'm saying what people will do in a group it's called crowd psychology what people will do in a group they will never do alone the same music you could hear in your bedroom won't cause you get up and dance but you get it on with thousands of people guess what you'll be doing what they do I'm just talking about sometimes what happens we get one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit we want to discern Spirits now you don't have to manufacture anything you don't have to tell people if you got the Holy Ghost you'll do this you do that no no just preach the word the Holy Ghost moves they didn't Jesus didn't tell them on the day of Pentecost what what would happen he just said stay there until you were a dude with power from an eye that's all he didn't he didn't tell him brother Bram said you must be born again you don't have to tell sheep you got to manufacture that's what's the matter of Pentecostal people today that's what's a matter with all christiandom they're trying to manufacture something a sheep isn't asked to manufacture wool it Bears wool you bear the fruit of the spirit you don't say glory to God I have to get black in the face I have to say this I I have to have sensation I have to dance in the spirit I got it no no uh-uh just get born again it's actually takes place itself do you see that's right not manufacturer something that man I've told you my testimony his name was Lonnie Lonnie frisbee at Calvary Chapel and he was preaching and and you know what he looked like Jesus long hair had a beard he said do those of you that want the Holy Ghost come forward I didn't know I didn't know anything just a young boy hadn't heard about the message or anything but I wanted the holy ghost man I got so sincere I went forward I was probably the first one and this guy named Lonnie okay and I think the last time I preached about this somebody texted his name Calvary Chapel Lonnie frisbee you know where he's at today way way way off but he says hey just start babbling just Babble brother just say something come on come on say something huh you speak French come on say something say say just Babble and I'm thinking Babel sounds like Babylon so he said just say something okay I don't know what to say see my that's what he said bro see my tie time my tie see my tie time my tie see my tie praise God praise God here's another one to receive the Holy Ghost see my ti time my ti Hallelujah I got it I got it I I ain't got it here's what happened because he told me raise your hand because don't doubt brother you got it you just got the Holy Ghost you know what young people do when they go to these meetings you got it Hallelujah nothing about repentance nothing about the life you're living just come up here we'll lay hands on you Devils will cast out every devil in hell come on up here yeah amen next thing you know Hallelujah and you get all set free and and everything but where are you in a couple weeks defeated my let the word of God bring a conviction let there be a real sincerity I've I've been doing wrong and I'm not Liv living right and they make things right then ask God for healing what happens Paul if you wanted the Holy Ghost and you were sincere and I told you you got it Hallelujah raise your hand and you knew in your heart you didn't get it you know what you would think God rejected me you know what there there's nothing Cedric you know what rejection feels like have somebody just reject you ah you reject me I reject you God if that's what you're going to do with me cuz I was sincere and that's why a lot of these young people they they they come under some kind of anointing discern the spirit now and and they're under this anointing and they told you got it that's it Hallelujah the Holy Ghost don't you doubt you got it Hallelujah and that's why they got to go from youth meeting to youth meeting again a youth meeting and it keep going and going and more and more and more and know and pretty soon they quit going why the dog never gets the bone you ever had a dog you know huh here here Pho Pho come on jump jump get look at him jump come on come on jump come on come on he's looking at you you think I'm dumb the dog don't jump what about you and I what about hey you've tried it I've been there done that that's why young people I want you to know God is my witness I don't want you to come to this message and let it be a religion let it just be a skirt long hair no makeup that no let it be a relationship between you and Jesus Christ get born again you become a new creature in Christ behold all things are passed away behold All Things become new the reason I love this message because I fell in love with God no I don't God doesn't force me I I'm not there under the fear of if hey you do something wrong first thing you you you do something r I do not serve God because of fire insurance I serve God because I love him Jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments I fell in love you have to try the spirits now I am not going to finish all my quotes I told you that it may be two or three parts to this let me just give you a couple quotes here and musicians if you come Brian Debbie it's good to see you guys bless you eesan Church age thou H has tried them that say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars my that's a blunt statement thou has tried them who call themselves Apostles isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves Apostles and how do they try them oh I love this here it is Galatians 1 and8 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than which we have already preached to you let him be a curse it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a daughter a dash Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change and what I gave originally let me be a curse you see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct God gave him the first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah and you see what these false Apostles are were doing they came with their own word these Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in their eye and said you're not saying what Paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it's not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it's the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the lusian church age and you'll know if he's a real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iot in that last stage when there'll be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they're keeping telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost but when that last day prophet comes on the scene he's if he is truly that Prophet he'll be crying get back to the word or you're lost he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen God help us to have discernment of spirit I'm not going after anyone any church Church any preacher no I just watch I came into this message 1971 I've seen him come and [Music] go I've seen the jumping I've seen the shouting I've seen all kinds of anointings [Music] quite honestly in many ways I get so disappointed in what some of the guys are preaching some of the [Music] ministry I say oh God why don't you just take me home I feel like Paul oh you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me if you could and Paul said in the scripture but now you hate me because I tell you truth yes amen saints of God I'm not here to tickle your ears I'm not here to sit here and try to drum something up I'm not I'm here to tell you what he said I want to take the movements of what's going on right now within the message and I want to discern it and I want to try the spirits and see if they're of God because you know what if you're not careful you'll get one another Spirit next thing you know you're out on a limb you're way out here and I had a brother very very nice brother I went to his home I was in the same meeting in hangle Hof Belgium his children children he had six seven children I [Music] forget and they all fell during those meetings and so we were visiting his house he said I want you children to come here and tell brother Ron how you got the holy ghost at the meetings good they got up here oh brother Ron we were in the meetings and guess what he said be sealed of God and I fell over and I got the Holy Ghost okay next next one all the way down stair step all the way down and I I told the brother I said brother I says I pray that that be the truth I said but these will be - tested Memorials of God we'll see if that was the Holy Ghost you'll see them they'll go on unto Perfection right they'll just keep going I said but I want to ask you my brother on the day of Pentecost the only thing that fell was the Holy Ghost I said Believers didn't fall nowhere in the scripture does it says and they fell when the Holy Ghost fell on them it says they spake words as the Holy Ghost did give them utterance I said but I'll show you in the scripture that when somebody is cast to the ground it's an evil spirit throws him into the fire throws him onto the ground throws him into the water come on now you know your Bible the brother said you just blasphemed the Holy Ghost I said I'm sorry get out of my house take your family right now and get out of my house you blaspheme the Holy Ghost I said brother I didn't blaspheme the Holy Ghost I said I just told you truth I said but the day will come I said wait and watch if your kids got the Holy Ghost they'll go on within a couple two three years where were they playing in a rock band this and that long hair girls no longer wearing dresses discern the spirit oh I wish to God that everyone here was born again and went on unto the adoption not all sons are obedient I want to ask you what's the difference between the wise and foolish virgin oil what is oil a sign of Holy Spirit foolish virgin never got oil therefore the time come when behold the bridegroom cometh and there was a movement oh we need the Holy Spirit we need oil we need oil in our lamb hey give us of your oil you got oil hey Justin give me give me some of your oil man my lamp it I light the Wicket goes out Andrew I need will you give me your oil go and buy and while they went to get oil guess what he came and the door was closed and and there was weeping and wailing and nashing at teeth we're in that day when there's going to be people seeking the real baptism of the Holy Ghost it ain't going to be there why if you're going to seek God you seek him now you don't wait till California sinks oh now I know he's a prophet oh now I know now I'll get real serious no I tell you what you get serious right now you get serious right now Heavenly Father Lord help us to have discernment of spirit that's why so many people have so many problems because they fail to discern the spirit that's trying to draw them out to discern the spirit of the world creeping in discern the spirit of getting one another Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit then they think well God's reject Ed me well maybe there's nothing to this message maybe I'll just go do my thing because I tried I was in Earnest it seemed like I didn't get it well my brother my sister ever who you are just keep going it's not going to be According to some man telling you Jesus keeps all his appointments if you're a son or daughter of God guess what if you never met him he's there's going to be a time when you meet him may not even be in in church might be when you're alone for when Jacob was left alone that's when he wrestled with god father God I commit this service into thy hands and ask you to be with each one may they begin to start using spiritual discernment when the true church catches a true revelation of who she is and by God's spirit discerns and withstands that spirit that Antichrist spirit that is among the church then and only then will she stand as an invincible Army therefore father I pray May everything that we do and say be based upon the word not on sensation I'm not against sensation I'm not against tongues but give me the word first I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's Stand Together God bless you very very different Father's Day message [Music] but I speak as a father huh that's what brother James he texted me he said brother
