now Sunday school will start please have your kids in the music room over here by 9 20 9 20 two Sundays from now Sunday school starts Lord bless Justin is he sings this morning so amen good morning how many of you want to commit your life to The Potter's hand you know what it's it's funny I I've been wrestling to sing this song because I wrote it it was after brother Steve's sermon on Pride and you know what you realize in your testimony that you build up a vessel in your life and then God comes and he breaks it if it's not like him right and um that is something that I I have really just not understood about my life I built my life up it broke and then constantly God's been rebuilding everything that I want to do God leaves me a different way it leads me a different way until you just throw up your hands at the end of the day and you say God whatever you want to do so I pray that this song speaks to you it's got a question at the end that I want you to pay attention to because it's really this is the most important part of our life can we humble ourselves to be used by God can we humble ourselves when our vessel is broken completely that when he picks up the pieces and he tells you who you are in him that you would understand it and that you would say Lord not your will not my will but yours be done and I just want to sing this song this morning it just really blesses you [Music] lift it up I found a warning and so confused [Music] my whole life it was built the storms of life for sure then we found a [Music] dish oh I was picked up from a Broken Vessels [Music] be made by God he reworks oh I was torn down from an image of Pride and full this ways oh but by Revelation I found myself in him oh he taught me things at first I didn't understand he gave me Revelation and told me who [Music] we see but I won't care for I'll be there at Jesus [Music] oh he reworked my own clay oh I was torn down and from an image of Pride and foolish ways over by Revolution I found myself [Music] that was remained by God did he rework oh were you foreign [Music] by Revelation have you found yourself in here amen amen thank you Justin beautiful song Beautiful song through it all through it all let's sing that this morning through it all through it all amen let's stand this morning as our pastor comes this morning through it all through it all thank you Hallelujah we love you

many cheers [Music] music consolation [Music] only come to make me stronger [Music] than Jesus says well I ordered your trust in God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign oh through it all times [Music] [Music] [Music] your last verse and [Music] the valley for the tribes so bring me through foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] the trust in God [Music] Hallelujah giving praise this morning [Applause] amen God bless you you can be seated for a moment yes God bless you wow through it all in the good times a bad time mountain tops valleys the trying of your faith is more precious to you than fine gold God bless you all this morning I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus each and every one that is here our guests visitors Daniel cullenbrenner God bless you it's good to have you here with us the Lord richly bless you um I have two prayer requests that are very deeply upon my heart right now one is brother Johan he's he's getting ready to cross over and he's on the last stages he is body functions sister Teresa says are shutting down he's no longer eating and and drinking and so we just pray for brother Johan and uh I prayed with sister Teresa over the phone last night and her and I agreed and we released his Spirit to God and said God honor thy servant to God if you would be so kind as to just let him gently pass away amen and go to his reward amen healing death actually brings the greatest healing of our mortal bodies amen and we pass from this mortality to immortality so we pray for them she needs our prayer at this time it's a very sad time and a lonely time if I could say that for sister Teresa so also a little Josiah this little man has just gone through hardship and trial since his birth and uh he's battling right now he's struggling the doctors don't know what it is and they run their tests and they practice medicine as they do we thank God for that but I'm just asking God be merciful to this little baby and may God raise him up show grace and mercy once again and be a an encouragement too to Ben and Megan and stuff because you know they as parents carry a burden um and 24 7. and uh so I'd like you to Bow your heads with me right now for a moment as I pray for both of these Our Kind heavenly father as we remember our brother Johan we remember his laughter his Zeal for the word his Joy of serving you and how he enjoyed talking about the message and the things of God and now he's at his life's end of his journey I pray o God that you will comfort him and what you send angels of Mercy to come down be at his bedside to help him as he crosses over father sister Teresa a faithful servant I pray that you will bless her to comfort her heart Lord give her a peace that passes all understanding and I pray for Ben and Megan right now Lord brother Ben sister Megan father how they have been so faithful they have just taken this and with a smile and a joy on their face they have gone through every trial the father eventually one's Spirit gets word down you get discouraged trial after trial but Lord we know that through it all we have learned to trust in you bless brother Ben sister Megan I pray bless their faithfulness by being gracious to their little son Josiah would you let him be raised up oh God as I just committed to you my heart is heavy for both of these and so I feel to pray as a Shepherd would pray I pray that you'll just be with him remember them I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord all right we have a pastor here from lumbambashi Congo he is shown up uh here I don't know where he's at uh brother Joshua mukibai if you will get him and come to the pulpit now he does not speak English so yes here he comes the Lord blessed them and uh I wanted him to greet the Saints he's just only here for a day or so wants to go see Sabino Canyon and those things and so we greet him in the name of the Lord so our brother Sam cabango God bless you my brother do view beneath God bless you okay may the Lord bless you richly I didn't hear your feedback you don't want the blessings you don't want the blessings I say may the Lord bless you richly I'm happy to be among you um like the bible say that is good for Braden to dwell together because that's where God sent his Blessing that's a reason that bring me here this morning my name is Sam Adair I'm your brother I'm coming from the Republic of Congo [Music] at the border of Congo and Zambia that way the Lord has given us the burden of a little church with which we save the Lord to visit the U.S particularly easy particularly here because I was in Houston I wanted to see where they took the picture of the Angel of the Lord and I came here or visited and to visit other places and mountains from which Our God God Prophet went and to give us a revelation of the message of the hour I'd say thank you to the Reverend pastor for the work that he is doing over here and also and I thank you for the good purpose and for this morning the only good word I can tell you is that the Lord Jesus blessed you richly [Applause] thank you I told him I said the next time that he comes I take an extra day and preach for us you know I I'd like to meet these men first and greet them and just kind of see their spirit and everything and it's always good to meet the Saints from other countries and all of that and I I've got an awful lot that I feel on my heart this morning and I pray that what God will do is he will unburden me from the things that I see that is going on right now and the Lord help me to be able to transfer this thought because God gives a thought it's usually a simple thought and he just gives it to you and and then the more that you look into it you find out that God is revealed in Simplicity let's stand together let's sing that song only believe brother Brown said that's our theme song [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] Lord you have given us your word you've given us the Holy Spirit which will lead and guide us into all truth you've sent to us a message in this end Time Lord that we might know how to worship you in spirit and in truth father God now I pray that you will come and bless your word illuminate it to our understanding father because if you remain an unknown God we will not know how to worship you but if you make yourself known and reveal yourself to us and make your word clear to our understanding father then we shall know even as we are known father I thank you I ask that you come and bless the reading of Thy Word and blessed to the hearts of thy people in Jesus Christ's name [Music] thank you thank you musicians God bless you Justin thank you thank you for that song that was inspired many times God births something out of your trial out of your calamity out of an issue out of something that happens in your life and you wonder why and then God shows you later that there was a purpose behind everything amen yesterday had a small video clip sent to me by brother Brian and Sarah they sent me a little clip of brother Neil he got his legs as prosthetic legs and yesterday he took his first several steps there and uh you know he it was just a few steps at first and he just kind of mechanically going there and he got there and and everything he said that was good amen God bless you our brother Neil may the Lord richly bless you as our one step at a time brother amen Matthew chapter 15. then we'll go to mark 7. then we'll go to the Book of Revelation Matthew chapter 15 verses 7 through 9. Matthew 15 verse 7. are you there amen ye Hypocrites well did isaiahs the prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men turn with me to Mark chapter 7. Mark chapter 7 verses 6 through 9. you know they Tom and we're testing Jesus because they saw his disciples came to eat and they didn't wash their hands for the Heat and they oh they were offended because they had been had all these rituals of Washings and different things that they were to do and here now the disciples come and with unwashed hands they go ahead and eat they bless the food and eat it and so we come into this portion of scripture Mark 7 verse 6. and he answered and said unto them well hath Isaiah's prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me I'll be in vain they do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and of Cups and of many others such like things do ye or ye do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition wow he said they honoreth me their mouth their lips but their heart is far from me and he says in vain do they worship turn with me the Book of Revelation we'll go to Revelations 19 then we'll go to revelation 22. Book of Revelation chapter 19. verses 9 through 10. and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I felt that his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy notice he said don't worship me I'm just a man don't worship Angels you worship God Amen amen revelation 22 verses 7 through 10. behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I saw and I John saw these sayings and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things and he seeth unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets of them which keep the sayings of this book notice again worship God and he seeth unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated amen we see other times when seal up John those things which you have heard we see others forbidden to write but here at the end of the book guess what God is doing he says seal not those things so we see there's an unsealing of the word of God there's an opening of the word of God that was not given in other ages but is given now in this age so we thank God for what he has done in this hour by sending a prophet Messenger to come and to share with us those Mysteries because Christ is the mystery of God revealed without the revealing of Christ you don't understand the Bible you don't understand whether he's one God three Gods whether you baptize father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ now I've been pondering over this thought for some weeks now and I wish to title my sermon this morning worshiping God because every one of us are interested in this every one of us are told by the scriptures to worship God to praise His holy name to exalt the god of heaven and all so each one of us are to be included not excluded but to be included in Holy Ghost worship amen so what is Holy Ghost worship how do we actually worship God and I wish to look at this in all angles so that we might have a greater understanding because I believe that you can worship God and it be vain worship you can light candles you can say prayers you can be ever so sincere and wouldn't it be horrible after you've done all those things you've been a good church member you you've done for years and years and years and you were so sincere and at the end God said it was in vain Compass Florida so I want to talk about worshiping God and I want to take true worship versus vain worship so Worship in Hebrew and in fact the the word worship is all through the Old and New Testament we are told by the prophets of old hell that we must worship God there are so many scriptures and I just became uh elated I I became joyful looking at all of the scriptures containing to how we must worship God and there's one thing that I do love to do and that is to worship Him but what kind of worship does God accept because there's all kinds of worship and we want to know the right kind that we might be accepted of God amen Worship in Hebrews Shaka it means to bow down to fall down to humbly beseech God in obeisance to do reverence and to worship it means to come before God with reverence and godly respect it's not just coming and before God's Great Majesty because he is God he's King and when you approach a king you've got to do it in a reverent manner over in Great Britain um if people are going to approach the king of England they have to do it correctly they have to come you just don't walk in and and do your thing I was told when Babe Ruth went to visit um the king of England that he went over there and he had been taught all little protocol this is what you do but him being who he was in an American who's going to do his thing before he could get introduced to the king he just walked into the room nonchalantly raises in hiking no reverence no protocol can you just imagine that's what Americans do we just don't really have the respect you know and the reverence and I wonder if it doesn't cross over into our servitude towards God Amen hi God hey buddy old pal when I I want you to under understand that the reverence and respect to God when I began to look up the glory of God and how we come into His presence it it comes from the Hebrew word gravitas which means heavy now brother Brahm said God doesn't count his men he weighs them now we're not talking about physical weight okay um so neither when we look at God and we talk about his glory and it says that he's he has a weightiness about him gravitas it's something that if I could say this and I for the lack of a better term so that you might understand when we came to this message we would hear sermon after sermon and each time wow something new would come up you know what we would say wow wow that's heavy you understand wow and the more that I know of God the more he becomes heavy it is not just with nonchalance and well God had just come in and uh you know you just accept anything in any old form of worship and not just do what I want to do will God help us to give him the reverence and the fear and respect the Bible says to fear God with a Godly reverence and fear for our God is a consuming fire amen the Greek word worship prosconio it means to bow in reverence to do homage to have reverence and to adore and so all through the scripture this you know Word Worship is used it's found in almost every chapter every book The Word Worship now let me just fill in with a little bit brother Branham said that Lucifer was God's right hand man he was there in the beginning he was one of the ones right there did you know that he was the leader of worship in heaven he was also instrumental through his lineage you follow it Nimrod musical instruments so he knew how to worship but all of that was okay until iniquity was found in him he used to lead the Angelic choirs so he knows how to worship God and did you know that the first battle that started in heaven was over the subject of worship amen you remember in Isaiah 14 it says how Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how Thou Art cut down to the ground and thou didst weaken the Nations Thor thou is said in thy heart now watch Pride I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides and I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high do you understand that was his desire he wanted to be worshiped so here at the very beginning what started the whole battle in heaven was about worship who do you worship and how do you worship Satan was cast down to the Earth and his influence is found in worldly affairs his titles reflect from the scripture and calls him the ruler of this world the God of this age and the prince and power of the air the Bible declares that the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one now our Prophet clearly told us many times he said that every nation every government in the world is controlled by Satan are we aware of that so we're not looking to anything here in America America started out remember she's found in the Book of Revelation chapter 13 she starts as a lamb but says that time will come when she will speak like a dragon understand America is falling at a very rapid rate it is setting up the precedent for the Dragon to make war it's a spiritual warfare it's going on so now he wants to have the people of the world to worship Him so the whole world system the prophet told us is Satan's Eden he's created a system for this world for the people to become deceived and to worship the creation and not the Creator he's always desired to take away the true worship of God and have the people to worship Him the Bible says that Satan is a mighty power but God Is An Almighty power you and I when we depend upon our own strength and our own uh abilities are no match for Satan the fact that Jesus said Satan he was speaking to Peter Satan's desire to sift you like he would wheat how many of you have ever felt the sifting of Satan in your life taking this and that and and and things and problems and uh uh all of these uh things in our lives complexes and had it not been for God praying for us guess what we would have been sifted but because God is watching over that he lets seed in you Satan is a gene enemy he can only go so far you're no match for the devil outside of Christ but in Christ I can do all things Satan is to be under my foot amen he has no control over me he can he can torment me he can give me trials but I will overcome every one of them because I've been made more than a conqueror through Christ amen I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me amen I want to see what the prophet said about worshiping God in the Ephesian Church age and this was an astounding quote when I read it it just seemed to open in many directions Ephesians Church age page 69 paragraph two now let us be very careful that we are not confused at this point thus we will seek the word to validate this claim let us go back to the book of the beginning Genesis in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one was good one was evil one was a produced life the other produced death there were two children who originally offered sacrifices to God let me repeat that that both offered sacrifices to God and then he quotes Genesis 4 verses 3 for 5. it says in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord now I want you to understand God had already cursed the ground Adam because thou has done this God didn't curse out of me curse the ground amen okay so the ground has been cursed so now Cain is taking up something cursed and Abe also brought of the first things of his flock oh he's a shepherd and of the father of the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and his offering he had no respect but one cane was evil being the father being of his father that Wicked one while Abel was righteous before the Lord again there were two children from the Flesh of the same parents they were the twins of Isaac and Rebecca one was the elect of God and the other was a reprobate both worshiped God in every single case there was worship of God involved I want you to see in every case there was worship of God involved are we together on that this is where it just opened up both in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planting together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God brother Brenham says in every case it involves worship wow so mystery Babylon now is being exposed by the Spirit of this hour the spirit of Christ revealing his word and we understand about mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots where does denominations Spirit of organized religion where does it come from he said mystery Babylon the Great Jezebel religion always centers around listen satanic worship let me show you what brother Branham said pergamian Church age pergamus was not originally the place where Satan as concerning human affairs dwelt Babylon has always been literally in figuratively his headquarters it was in the city of Babylon the satanic worship had its origin whoa satanic worship you see everything that started in heaven has come down and was cast down to a human battle it's all about worship do you know the Bible says that the Antichrist system will finally head itself up into the image of the Beast how many of you know that his final stage will cause him to be worshiped by all those whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life Revelation 13 verses 6 through 9 and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given over all kindred's tongues and Nations and all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him notice it's all about worship amen and who is it that these all are going to worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear amen America Revelation 13 what was it started as a lamb she's going to speak as a dragon and you see the laws coming on that are enacted now by the left wing out of their mind people that have gone totally insane that let me tell you they're doing everything they can to take away anything about the true worship of God why they're taking away your laws your rights you can't have a gas stove imagine you can't drive a gas car you can't have a ceiling fan they're they're wanting to control everything about you well let me tell you that reminds me of the story of the little Eagle in the nest all of the little fluffy things are being taken out all your little comfort of ladies see you and I trusted in riches in my house and my car God's taken this out that out that uh it's getting awfully uncomfortable out here why because the nest is fixing to get emptied somebody say Amen I'm about ready to get out of here I find no more comfort in this world Hallelujah so Fellowship by Redemption brother Branham says and today we still use it self-sufficiency we use all the different ideas and vain philosophies of men it's absolutely of not Jesus said men worship me teaching for Doctrine the traditions of men Worship in vain you could Worship the Lord and still not worship in the right way it would not be reckoned to you for reconciliation now let me tell you brother Branham begins to preach this in denominational thinking people who put all of their their their understanding about God and worshiping God under a denominational viewpoint and he comes along and he says you know what you could Worship the Lord and it's still not be received by God now Tabernacle I want you to think on this so he's now speaking to his church let not it pass by and say brother Bill come in and said so and so take it in your heart ponder over and why do we have our ups and downs why does things go the way they're going is because first we got to get back to the foundation Hallelujah he makes the word of God as our absolute he said that is the rock of Revelation the church is founded upon not upon ideas not upon opinions but upon the saith the Lord so the prophet is having issues rise even within his own church many of them had come out from quote Pentecost or denomination Baptist Methodist Presbyterian all of the different ones so he's got to correct them so that he can keep them in balance now in spiritual adoption let me show you what he says and it's possible get it now listen you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge that you should do it but going to church that way is worshiping in vain well I went to church for so many years I knew you should go to church vain no star but when there's nothing happens down in your heart that makes you love God in such a way you can't stay away from the church that's the revelation God revealing that's the reason and you can't wait to come to church not to see one another not to hear some eloquent speaker but for you for God to share with you spiritual thinking for him to share with you his mind to give you revelation continuing on he says in the Hebrews series 57 we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship Him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life now here's something that's going to Astound you when we're at work we should worship Him every time the opportunity presents itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him you want to worship God testify tell them how your candle got lit if you see some of you ladies you see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking her and saying sister there's a better life than this let me just say this I had a a brother over in Switzerland who there was a couple people they started a company kind of like an insurance company or something and um so he got hired and he got called into the boss's office it was a woman and he was just kind of telling her some things and whatever in his as he left the room he said I just wanted to tell you God bless you he walks out of the room she says hey come back here what did you mean God bless you I just I meant God bless you that opened the door now watch this it's amazing that opened the door for him to testify to her she comes to Christ receives the message her husband and guess what everyone in the company everyone in the company was this all of them got converted and came into the message then the company fell apart there was only one reason it was started because a brother testified and said God bless you and I will tell you God will give you opportunity after opportunity if you will open your mouth and say hey God bless you may you have a wonderful blessed day today you will just blow somebody's mind and they'll say there's something different about you then you have an open door to testify watch this when we seize one someone's sick he says and the doctor says there's no more can be done we ought to Worship the Lord by telling them there's a God in heaven that answers prayer [Music] and worship God by testifying it's not up to you to heal people it's not up to you to change people it's up to you to worship God and let them know whether they accept him or not guess if I and tell them there is a God in heaven people will argue about what you believe or how you dress or the way that you go to church but there's one thing that they cannot argue about and that is your testimony testify that was once lost now I'm saved I once was blind now I see glory to God that's how I worship God you know what makes me different because I know how to worship [Applause] I know where he brought me I know where he come from Hallelujah it's not to be just worshiping God after the ministering of the word no testify of God wherever you go work in the hospital in the grocery store at the gas station at school amen Harvest Time brother Branham says in vainer they worship me they actually worship God Cain actually worshiped God in the beginning but in vain do they worship me what's vain it don't do no good they might say well I do this I dance in the spirit I speak in tongues I prophesy I preach the gospel but failed to let your hair grow out fail on one thing see what happens the spirit will leave you right there that's what's happened to our churches failed do you see if we fail to be obedient in one commandment we're guilty of all brother Brown said it for a woman to trim her hair he says God doesn't even hear her prayers in vain worship me oh it's a beautiful worship but in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man Prophet noticed what was happening in meetings so let's see what he said about it because remember he was ordained a missionary baptist Baptists are kind of straight on the word they're kind of legal and and and and no emotion so brother Branham in the sermon trying to do God a service 1965 he says now look today at the big Crusades we've had across the land it's proven it's been in vain whoa whoa here's a profit these revivals across the land it's been in vain and Jesus didn't Jesus say here now Luke 7 7 in vain do they worship me in vain like David bringing the ark up how many of you know in second Samuel 6 it talks about David danced why was he dancing bringing the ark but his dancing stopped when uza got killed then he was afraid take and put in odometer right in vain did Ahab train them prophets invaded Balaam take that money teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of man it's the Commandment of God that counts no matter how sin then people are really sincere you hear that so much they are so sincere that don't mean nothing Jehovah's Witness Seven Day Adventists and all those Cults got out here on the street and do things that wanna you wouldn't do it one of us wouldn't do I got Jehovah's Witness that near my house they get up at six o'clock in the morning and at my Park they sit out there and put a sign and get all these books and they sit there and all dressed up even in the Heats of the summer I I go I go buy these guys good morning how you doing when we went to on vacation in Turks and Caicos right outside of our condo across the street I walk by to go to Starbucks six o'clock in the morning and in 85 degree morning Heat and 90 humidity I'm sweating going 100 yards and these guys are they're in their suits and ties because they're sincere let me see you do that get up and go put a sign put some spoken word books out there and then testify to god of what God's done in this you see I'm saying these people are sincere and I think they're a whole lot more sincere than we are he says Catholic stand on the corner and beg and so forth like that work billions times billions times billions is dollars still beg for it sincere No Doubt churches go and preach and so forth ministers stand in the pool but do everything they can to get new members into the church but it's a new ark there's only one Ark to follow that's the word of God and then contrary to that Ark stay away from it it's a new card not on the shoulders of God's rights stay away from the thing don't have nothing to do with it you can ever be so sincere and be sincerely wrong now the first time that this Missionary Baptist met Pentecostal people never been around them before you'll remember he went by and he saw and he went there and and uh I'm not going to go into the story because you all know it but in the seat of discrepancy watch brother Brennan we're going to pick it up now remember he hears tongues and interpretations and oh my and see these people jumping and shouting and all this he said oh my I'm among angels he says after that well I thought if I could only get where these two main men that spoke in tongues and interpreted that was burning me up in my heart I wanted it so bad then he goes on talks about the gift in his life I go down to the next highlighted if I could ever talk to them well in the spirit that was in the building felt like it it's really the spirit of God so now the spirit that's in the building he feels like it's the spirit of God he says so I got to talk to one of them ask him a few questions he was a real genuine Christian there's no doubt about that that man was a real believer the next man when I talked to him if I ever met a hypocrite that was one of them now here's a gift in his hand remember now this is second pull for actually first pull sign in hand second pulled the sermon is Spirit now watch one's a real believer the other hypocrite and here's that Spirit one rang out according to all I know genuine the other one was no good at all and the spirit fallen on both of them now how can that be I did it had me puzzled now he he's going away I thought I was among Angels now I might be among devils okay this is his experience so now the next paragraph brother Branham said two years later so now it's two years this has been pondering he'd been to this meeting all of this excitement and some man two years later I've been praying in a cave where I go to pray how many know that Elijah's prayer closets the wilderness so he says I'm laying I'm there putting my Bible on a on a log and he says and and the wind blows it up to Hebrews 6. he reads he says but the rain cometh upon the Earth often to water it to dress it but the thorns and thistles would be rejected but the wheat would be gathered I thought well just the wind happened to blow that open I laid the Bible down again and guess what here come the wind bloated open that happened three times I thought well no that's strange Hallelujah how many of you believe that God does strange things said Lord why would you open that Bible for me to read that when I get down to that where thorns and thistles which is nine to rejection whose end is to be born I thought my why would you open that to me there next paragraph these real Visions come without pulling into any gear that's just God so now he's had this vision and now there's going to be an interpretation so now watch this there was a man dressed in white went around sowing wheat after he went around the curvature of the Earth around come a man looked horrible he's dressed in black he was throwing weed seeds all over it they both come up together and when they did they both was thirsty because the rain was needed and each one looked like was praying with his little head bent over lord Send the Rain Send the Rain the great clouds come up and the rain fell upon the Earth both of them when it did the little weed jumped up began to say praise the Lord praise the Lord little wheat jumped up right at the same side and said praise the Lord praise the Lord the vision was interpreted rain falls on the just anyone just Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoicing in Hypocrites and Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits they are known that's the only way it can ever be known by the fruits then you say that now since Wild Oats or wild wheat and Grains sometimes impersonate a genuine domestic grain so close it would deceive the very elected I think we're living in a timely age when these things should be preached on and talked about how many of you believe that amen so now you know I love to worship God I think that when we sing songs and we begin to Worship You Feel The anointing of God how wonderful it is and I remember that somebody shared a song that we we sang hear it our church and so I looked up who it was that was the author and I watched them sing it and boy did it give me a shock because I see short-haired women with all kinds of makeup and earrings and yet singing a very inspirational song okay that song I got a fire shut up in my bones and it's becoming quite popular among messaged churches I got a fire shut up in my bones I got a fire shut up in my bowling goes on and on and the people pretty soon everybody just jumping and got a fire and if this is fire was in you you know and all of this stuff and people and man I began to see and you know what the people in that denomination who are not living according to God's word are all their worshiping God and do not tell me they're not worshiping they are they got their hands up and they're crying and they're kneeling down and they're doing all of this kind of stuff and it's worship I wonder if it's accepted do you understand amen amen and I I want to see a few things here let me see here I didn't want to skip this they're singing with feeling and enthusiasm huh wow well you can find it all over the internet of the way they're acting um the what they're preaching and what they're doing and you can just begin to see and watch the way they act okay it's not because of the word it's because at the end of the service what they do is use the channel of music to get the people all inspired now listen God doesn't need the piano or the organ those are instruments to help us worship that's true David played a harp evil spirits left and you see the the worship that is going on even among denomination look at what they're doing now if we're not careful what we'll do is we'll mimic what they're doing because they call it worship now saints of God sometimes I think we got it preconceived in our our minds that worship is getting out of control is getting in the spirit and you lose control of yourself your tongue your body and you shake and you jump or you do things and say wow that church was so in the spirit why because they ran they jumped they got excited and there are people that are leaving solid-based word churches because they want to go and feel an anointing and be able to go ahead and because you know what it makes them feel good they're not preaching against sin they're just saying bless God I tell you what if the Holy Spirit was here I'll tell you what if nobody else dances I'll dance if nobody else will shout I'll shout if they'll nobody else yambaja and pretty soon you have the misconstrued idea that that's what the holy ghosts would do on you when the spirit of the Lord moves on my heart I will dance like David dance you see what I'm saying no let the Spirit come upon you first God's Spirit coming on you and you dance me for him it's not a show it's holy it is it's not here because of the music nonsense brother brem said you want to see if it's a real Revival unplug the organ foreign I'm just saying what he said okay I want to worship God but real worship of God comes from the heart not with just the mouth not with just the lips oh God I worship you I worship you oh God and God says in vain you worship me why I told you not to cut your hair I told you not to wear men's clothes I told you and on and on and he says you watch when you do that not even there in there my rain is falling on the just and the unjust is that true yeah the same Holy Ghost that's falling on the just is falling on the unjust the same rain that falls on the bride falls on the foolish virgin the same rain that falls on the true seed falls on the false sea somebody say same rain same rain same sunshine Acts 2 verse 17 and 18. and they shall come to pass in the last days see if God I will pour out my spirit upon just bright just message believers all flesh sign hey yes that is heavy I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh sons and daughters with dream dreams and prophesy there'll be all kinds of movement of God now a sermon that brother Branham really goes into the depth of how to worship God he preaches the sermon God's only provided place of worship he said there's one place there's only one place of worship and he says everything outside of that is vain worship wow it's amazing so brother Ren said God's provided place of worship now remember he hasn't provided place one place alone where he will meet the believing children anywhere else won't work remember Jesus said when he was on Earth talking to a bunch of people who were very religious very fine very cultured a very zealous people of God but Jesus said to them in vain do you worship me teaching for Doctrine the traditions of man remember how Pious those people was and how zealous of God I believe if we were counting the people who were more zealous of today or that day they would be more zealous than we are wow far more but Jesus God made flesh Among Us said in vain do they worship me now he didn't say they didn't worship Him he said they were worshiping him in vain amen so anything in vain as of no avail don't do no good you should never do it because you're just wasting your time you're wasting your breath you're wasting your efforts until we come to know what we're doing how do you know what you're doing revelation faith is what made the offering of the first worship between two people on earth Cain and Abel the first two that ever worshiped let me say this it was started in heaven worship send down to earth and the first two guess what Cain hated Abel because of how he my hatred the first homicide let me say this the first fratric side killed his brother why because he hated that his worship was not received um outside of Holy Ghost revelation of spirit and its truth it is vain worship they only provided place of worship is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to you by the Holy Spirit faith is revelation it's a gift of God it's not of Works lest any of you boast God's provided a place of worship 65. I'll choose the place where the people will worship me no other place will I meet them now it's got to be that place and we ought to seek it out find out where it's at then go there and think we should turn there quickly where we find the place living other things leaving other things alone man's tradition then is in vain we should never fool with it there needs being somewhere someplace that has he has provided a place for us that we could come and worship and would be received now remember outside of that chosen place no matter how sincere you are how fundamental you are you still are worshiping in vain I think I looked up Cain worshiped there's like 135 quotes on Cain worship God don't tell me he didn't worship we're talking about worshiping God now turn with me if you would to one portion of scripture let me try to bring this to a a close here if I could turn with me to Saint John chapter 4. verses 13 through 26. very familiar portion of scripture with Jesus speaking to the woman at the well Saint John 4 verse 13. Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman said unto her him sir give me this water do you know she couldn't get it until she asked sir give me this water brother Branham said she got so much water she left her water pot and ran into the city because the real vessel that got filled all right the woman said sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither Roman Anson said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband what pool is that second point discern the heart right second pull amen amen so he discerns her heart for you've had five husbands and the one whom thou has now is not thy husband in thou saidest thou truly so she's had five and the one she's living with now is not her husband do you have Revelation who the true husband was number seven the one who stood before the woman saith in unto him sir I perceive thou art a prophet yeah that is that's exactly it I perceive thou art a prophet brother Branson who told you that I'm a prophet he says I don't claim to be no prophet he says you say I'm a pro I don't call myself a prophet amen I don't take that honor to myself but when I hear him speak you know what I say thou art I promise can you say Amen to that now what she gets brother REM said she gets religious our fathers worshiped watch we're talking about worshiping God our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship it's all about worshiping God Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father wow he's changing if you'll be spiritual now and watch this he's changing the place of worship Moses was told he met a burning bush on Mount Sinai go get the people deliver them and bring them back to Mount Sinai at this mountain they shall worship God then Jerusalem Solomon goes and builds a temple on Mount Moriah and it was there you had to go to Jerusalem to worship God are we together so now it's been traditions of man they've gone to these places mountains and different things because they've heard of what God has done but he says not at this mountain nor at Jerusalem worship you you worship what you know not we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is I love this when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and Truth I know the Messiah when he comes he's gonna he's gonna say these things now he's going to blow her mind excuse the expression I I that speak unto thee and he God likes to reveal himself then he pulls back into that invisible Realm two on the road to Emmaus it doesn't matter he he many times now watch this God will do this in your life throughout multitudes of times he will come to you you're praying about a certain thing and he comes in here I am oh God and all of a sudden he pulls back see you remember when I preached on the right hand of God you remember there are I think seven times more scriptures about God's right hand so if you're a left-handed person you feel left out because God's right-handed well no I'll tell you God is ambidextrous but the Bible says on his left hand where he does work right hand blessings everybody loves right and blessing oh my everybody when they get it right hand blessing in the right hand of Fellowship it's an anointing it's power Hallelujah but left hand blessing is where he moves back into that invisible Realm even when I can't see him he's working even when I can't feel him he's working what a left hand let me tell you most of the times in your life when God is dealing with you it's in an unseen realm it's in that invisible Union hallelujah it's not these right-hand blessings dancing on the Mountaintop it's in the valley of depression wow Mount Sinai where Moses met the burning bush we'll go there let thus save the Lord Pharaoh let my people go we're only going to go three days journey so that we might go worship God then they go to Jerusalem I've made a place the holy of holies not Mariah the Holy Temple Solomon bill wow God's chosen place of worship but Watch What Happens when anything that God does for you and tells you you should do it if you lose Godly reverence and respect it just becomes vain worship huh without the sincerity coming at you I just come yeah it's another Sunday Little Star I've been there yeah went and did I sang a few songs went and it's not changing your life huh it's vain worship how many of you know you can have all Spirit no truth or you can have all truth and no spirit brother Ram said we need a balance and I think we hear it evening Light Fellowship we need to make sure we stay a balance amen it's not just all a word and it's just not all spirit because if we are going to worship God true worshipers the father seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth there's a balance God's provided we have approach to Fellowship 1960. many people have spirit with no truth others have truth and no spirit it's like the man that's got money in the bank but don't know how to write a check the other one knows how to write a check got no money which one are you if we could just get those two together but Israel let the worship of God become rituals and offerings they didn't do it with reverence and sincerity and Isaiah picks it up I just want to show you this Isaiah picks it up in chapter 1 verses 11 through 14. to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the Lord I am full of burnt offerings of rams fatten the beat end of the FED beast and I Delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or if he go wait a second God you told us to make the sacrifice I'm sick of it when you come to appear before me who hath required this in your hand to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an Abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the callings of assemblies I cannot away with it it is Iniquity even the solemn meetings your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul heateth they are a troubling to me I am weary to Bear them in one place he said they are a stench in my nostril wow oh God let us look at our worship may be well balanced between spirit and Truth let me ask that Paramount question again does God accept all worship where do we worship and how do we worship the first time in the Bible the word worship is used Book of Genesis remember in Genesis 22 Abraham is told to go sacrifice his son Isaac do you know he has waited 25 years for the promise to come to pass and now here he has his son and God is asking Abraham to sacrifice his son wow let me ask you take the Old Testament laws in Deuteronomy Leviticus numbers Thou shalt not suffer thy Sons and Daughters to pass through the fire you shall not have them as an offering it looks unto Abraham as though God is asking him to give human sacrifice of his own son it's only a it's only a pre-figure because God did not allow him why be because there was already a lamp it was already while he was walking up the Bible says that he walked three days journey and God showed him where it was ended when he got to the place he knew I must go and I in the lad will come back to you but we've got to go and to worship oh God the first time it's Abraham is first thing it's used in Scripture I and my son have got to go and worship wow his heart's being tore out of him he's asking me I imagine for three days oh is that the place is that the place oh Isaac's walking along with his dad how am I he knows Abraham knows the cost oh oh and I get to the spot oh my his heart boom boom boom boom boom it's here it's here oh God I don't understand I don't know why but I love you now here's something very very interesting God did not stop him when he tied him up and placed him on the altar God did not stop him when he took the knife in his hand God stopped him when he put power to the night stay thy hand Abraham for now I know you love me wait a second wait a second God is omniscient he knew what Abraham would do he knew the hearts of Abraham Abraham didn't know he would go through with it Abraham proved to God I love you it was then God he says you're long your name is no longer Abram your name is Abraham why you're like me I'm sharing a part of Elohim I'm sharing a part of my name I'm sharing a part of my attribute you're like me Abraham Hallelujah true worship to worship just doesn't come in each generation becomes generation after generation songs of worship have been written in every age why because birth out of the message of that hour come the songs of that age Justin just saying one of them birthed in laodicea wow isn't that amazing huh well I gotta proved I'm one in a million I've got a show power of the blood and I gotta prove I'm not like those from Satan's Eden I've got to show that I'm a person that this world isn't worthy of ah wow songs I love to hear these songs birthed from this message they mean more to me the others are trans they cross transgeneration songs that were written in the second or third Church age are the songs by Luther and Wesley they're beautiful songs do you understand that because they were done under worship they were given under inspiration that song Amazing Grace wow they could sing it in every generation Amazing Grace how sweet to sound the saved a wretched like me okay and so these songs of worship I want to ask you a question what caused Paul to be brought before magistrates in his day what caused Paul to come before magistrates and why was he brought before councils because of the way he worshiped Acts chapter 18 says then the Lord spoke to Paul in a night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for I am with thee and no man shall set thee to hurt thee for I have much people in this city and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of God among them then galio was a deputy of Acacia and Jews made an Insurrection with one Accord against Paul and brought him to the Judgment seat took him to court saying this fellow persuaded men to worship God contrary to the law Paul you hear a tick we're bringing you to court why because of the way you worship it was a problem in the beginning it was a problem in Genesis it was a problem in Acts it's a problem today God don't ever let us divide ourselves because we worship different than someone else we're one we not may not be the shoutness or jump in us but we still worship God amen I believe we're all experience exactly the same thing again today that's because of worship it's not doctrinal issues right now ministers are not fighting about well he's preaching false Doctrine no it's about well they don't worship like we do who cares listen I know that sometimes culturally you worship different in different places in different ways okay hey let me tell you in the Congo in their song service they get excited they do man when they talking about we are Marching over to Jerusalem we are and the sisters have put their purse on their hand we are Marching over down the Valley of the and man everybody's excited we sing in we're it's hard enough to get us to clap white men Don't Clap against or jump they can't even jump very high but we're all different and I don't want to americanize my Congolese you worship God and you hey if you wanna you go ahead yeah we all worship God differently so who's right what culture is right well I'll tell you what in our weddings here in America we don't do what you do over there well does that mean our culture is right and yours is wrong are you kidding me it's the culture here in America that at a wedding you drink booze you listen to rock music you you dance and all of that because that's the culture of a modern day wedding in America I remember my twin brother's wedding they had a band rock and roll band he said I dedicate this song to my wife this morning under my thumb under my cause she's under my thumb how would you like to be his wife under mother that's how many message ministers they are they're under my thumb my authority oh stop it that is the weaker vessel you love them you guard them you protect them how'd you like to dedicate that song to your wife okay okay excuse me my wife tells me when she gets out of the car stay focused honey I said okay now watch this Acts chapter 24 let me close let me close I'm not closing yet but I'm closing acts 24 verses 5 through 14. watch this we have found this man a pestilent fellow a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world and a ring leader now the sick of the nazarenes who also have gone about to profane the temple oh my he's brought into the court because of worship and so these I'm not going to read all the scripture go to verse 11. because they'll make us understand now Paul's speaking for himself that there are yet but 12 days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship why do you go to Jerusalem I'm going to go to worship they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues or in the city neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me you bunch of liars but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I so worshiped by the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets couldn't we see the same thing they look at you you're weird you're strange you're odd balls your Heretics you believe some kind of deal a prophet Angels God speaking thus saith the Lord what the spirit is saying to the church I believe all the law and the prophets why because he said if you'll just get the people to believe because he said if you're not elect seed you can't believe but if you are he said you can't help but believe me you got no choice he said they call it heresy so worship I the god of my fathers you see what it was about it was Worship in heaven Satan cast down to earth it's still about worship it became worship between Cain and Abel and I'm saying to this to the message believing Believers around the world whether you go to my church or not do not let the devil try to divide us because we see worship differently We Are One because a nickel AIDS in spirit is to divide and conquer get you all divided well it's got to be this way and it's over what worship first homicide ever recorded and the Bible was over worship true worship contains a balance of mixture of spirit and Truth musicians go ahead and come true worship centers around the believer's heart and their obedience to the word not with just the mouth not with just the lips but with the heart because if your heart is far from God your worship is vain it's not accepted you see I want you to understand that trying to do something to get God's attention to appease him for him to see you is a heathen characteristic that's not how loud you scream it's not how high you jump or how much you run around how many times you speak in tongues or prophesy you don't have to appease God by doing something to get his attention First Kings chapter 18 perfect example Elijah and they took the Bullock which was given them and they dressed it called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon saying oh Bale hear us there was no voice nor any that answered and they leapt upon the altar which was made a little bit of zeal well God ain't here in his soul and it came to pass and Elijah mocked him cry aloud in other words hey me hey watch this for he is a God either he's talking or he's pursuing or he's on a journey or per adventuring sleepeth must be awakened so cry loud he don't hear you and they cried aloud and they cut themselves you talk about sincere after the manner with knives and lenses till the blood gushed out upon him John dobsky you've been over there in the Philippines you've seen those guys take those razor blades and whip their backs until their backs are bloodied sincere you've seen it John what they were doing is trying to get God's attention [Music] when it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied okay look at this until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voiced nor any to answer or any that regard it like I told you there's over 125 quotes of Cain worshiped God let me show you just a couple just so we kind of show you what brother Brown said show us the father its suffices of Cleveland Ohio 1950 look Cain and Abel both of them wanted to worship God and Cain he built her an altar to God now if an altar is all that God requires Cain was justified Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all God wants Cain was justified then Cain also built an altar and he worse he put a sacrifice on it and knelt down and worship God but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way the faith that was once delivered to the Saints 1953 Cain was just as sincere I believe as evil was he was just as much a Believer as Abel was fundamentally in worshiping he was just as fundamental as Abel was both of them both boys realized they were lost both boys wanted to find favor with God both boys brought a sacrifice both boys worshiped both boys belonged to church if a church sacrifice and worship is all that God requires and God condemned Cain he is unjust in doing so correct he'd be unjust for if we worship all God requires if worship is all that God requires Cain worship just the same as Abel did and perhaps a more beautiful worship than that of Abel faith is what makes a difference in our worship to the Lord by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice it's not us trying to do something to appease God so he'll look at us no If His Eye Is on the Sparrow I know he watches over me I don't have to try to get his attention hey God hey God look at me hey be still no I'm God reverence holy respectful we are programmed in Our Minds when the sermon is over that's when we worship God brother Branham said no just testify that's how you really worship I want all of you to start testifying more tell somebody thank God praise God this is somebody the waitress today after she brings your food just say hey God bless you may have a blessed day today oh wow you might spark somebody's interest like that brother did over there in Switzerland just God Bless you that's all he said it costs about eight or ten people all to come into the message guess what then the whole company fell apart just say God bless you impresses many Believers because they've been programmed with mental manipulation understand this preconceived idea well if God was here I'll tell you thank you it's mental manipulation I'll shout if I have to I'll dance if I have to I'll tell you what I'm not ashamed well I'm not ashamed also but it is not my dancing and shouting that gets attention with God what is it is when my faith reaches up all right brother brother Gene who married Rosella Griffith I can't think of his last name Gene what Mom I can't think of this a lot Gene came to my church it wasn't a Believer married Rosella you guys remember the converted alcoholic remember the one that brother ram calls her out [Music] Gene was coming to my church because Rosella was
