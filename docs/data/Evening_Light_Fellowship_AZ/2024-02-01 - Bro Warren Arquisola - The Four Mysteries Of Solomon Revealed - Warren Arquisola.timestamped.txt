[35:16] throne and it uh and as it this and now
[35:21] oh Lord thy God thou Hast made thy
[35:24] servant King instead of David my father
[35:28] and I am but a little child according to
[35:32] the history
[35:34] Solomon was about 12 years old this
[35:39] time and I know not how to go out or
[35:44] come in and thy servant is in the midst
[35:47] of thy of thy uh people which thou Hast
[35:51] chosen a great people that cannot be
[35:56] numbered nor are counted for
[35:58] multitude give therefore thy servant an
[36:03] understanding our and the understanding
[36:06] hard to judge thy people am that I may
[36:09] discern between good and bad for who is
[36:13] able to
[36:14] judge this thy so great
[36:18] people a 12-year-old kid going to the
[36:22] White
[36:25] House
[36:28] but because of his
[36:30] prayers God was pleased he did not ask
[36:35] for soldiers for for for uh uh money and
[36:40] wealth he asked for wisdom to rule the
[36:45] people of
[36:47] God and because of that right mental
[36:51] attitude because of that right
[36:54] prayers God not only giving him wisdom
[36:58] but God gave him uh granted him riches
[37:02] and Glory that his name people will know
[37:07] from the uttermost part of the
[37:09] earth right and here was the the the the
[37:15] uh
[37:17] God and this speech pleased the Lord th
[37:22] that Solomon had asked this thing and
[37:26] God said said unto him because thou Hast
[37:29] asked this
[37:30] thing and Hast not asked for thy self
[37:35] long life neither has asked riches for
[37:39] thyself nor has asked for the life of
[37:43] thine
[37:44] enemies but has asked for
[37:50] thyself understanding to discern
[37:53] judgment behold I have done Accord
[37:56] according to thy words lo I have given
[37:59] thee a wise and understanding heart so
[38:04] that there was none like thee before
[38:06] thee neither after
[38:09] thee shall any arise like unto
[38:13] thee and I have also given thee that
[38:18] which thou Hast not asked both riches
[38:21] and honor so that there shall not be any
[38:26] am among the Kings like unto thee all
[38:28] thy all thy
[38:30] days and in and and if thou Hast walked
[38:34] in my ways to keep my statutes and my
[38:39] Commandments as thy father David did
[38:42] walk then I will lengthen thy
[38:47] days and Solomon awoke and behold it was
[38:52] a
[38:53] dream and he came to Jerusalem and stood
[38:56] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[39:00] Lord and offered up burnt offering or
[39:03] offerings and offered peace offerings
[39:07] and made Feast to all his
[39:12] servants I was listening to to the uh
[39:17] sometimes you know you you're you're not
[39:20] doing anything you scroll look for a h a
[39:23] a a little bit of wisdom from from the
[39:27] from the rabbis or Scholars and I was s
[39:32] watching this
[39:34] YouTube and this Rabbi was
[39:38] explaining when
[39:40] Solomon asked for
[39:43] wisdom God gave him a wisdom an
[39:48] extraordinary wisdom
[39:51] amen that this kind of
[39:53] wisdom when he woke up
[39:57] he can hear the birds
[39:59] talking he understood what they're
[40:04] saying and it's the same thing when I I
[40:07] I went to Sab Sabino Canyon last Monday
[40:12] and I saw a rabbi over there Rabbi means
[40:16] teacher and I I asked him about the
[40:22] things that I
[40:23] heard and he said yes
[40:26] because he said even the the the trees
[40:30] has
[40:31] language even the insects has language
[40:35] so everything that you tell you're
[40:37] asking me is
[40:39] true and I was said at least two or
[40:42] three that gathers in thy
[40:44] name right God
[40:48] confirmed that the rabbi was telling was
[40:51] true so
[40:53] now I said I will at least I will share
[40:56] that a little bit so even the insects
[41:00] even the trees that the wave was you
[41:03] know the trees was moving if the if the
[41:06] wind
[41:07] blows Solomon understood
[41:10] it but he was thinking maybe that there
[41:15] was
[41:16] no um uh how do you call this uh there
[41:19] was no no uh
[41:22] depression on the
[41:25] trees
[41:27] because you know
[41:28] why because they did not
[41:31] fall we
[41:33] fell right man fell
[41:37] yes so so that's why the animals are
[41:40] happy we we always
[41:43] struggle but God gave Solomon a wisdom
[41:46] that nobody can understand
[41:50] him so now
[41:53] Solomon there was a story
[41:57] about this woman uh two prostitute woman
[42:01] women that when this two delivered a a a
[42:07] child or a
[42:09] baby or
[42:12] babies one woman
[42:16] overlaid her son and she died and and
[42:19] and and and the baby
[42:21] died so
[42:24] now she really want to have a baby so
[42:27] what she did she went to another room
[42:31] and took the other baby and it's not
[42:35] hers but then when the the The Other
[42:39] Woman woke up she found out that the
[42:42] baby was dead so she said this is not my
[42:47] baby you know I I I really I was
[42:51] thinking about the the the nature of the
[42:55] mother that she can
[42:57] discern her own
[43:00] babies as always brother Robert say you
[43:03] may forget your son and your daughter's
[43:06] name but God always knew you before the
[43:10] foundation of the world because God
[43:13] engraved your name in in in her own Palm
[43:19] hallelujah amen thank you and this woman
[43:22] when she saw she she said this is not my
[43:27] baby so she went to the council and then
[43:30] the council was not really uh uh cannot
[43:34] cannot resolve because they doesn't have
[43:37] a
[43:38] wisdom and then this woman went to the
[43:41] higher
[43:43] Court to King Solomon right on and when
[43:47] King Solomon was listening to them and
[43:52] they cannot really resolve the
[43:54] problem he said said give me my sword I
[44:00] will cut this baby in half and I will
[44:02] give to two of
[44:04] you but here was the mother the real
[44:08] mother yes she said no my Lord I'd
[44:12] rather give my baby to her I don't want
[44:15] her to
[44:16] die but the other woman said it's it's
[44:21] it's
[44:21] even yes give the H and I I I'll get the
[44:25] h
[44:27] and Solomon said the real mother is here
[44:32] give that baby to
[44:34] her and then when the the the the Fox
[44:38] News delivered that
[44:40] news
[44:41] CNN you know what happened there's so
[44:44] many people from the Philippines from
[44:48] Africa from Nicaragua from Pakistan
[44:51] heard the good
[44:53] news yes amen am and and what they did
[44:57] they want to see they want to visit him
[45:01] that's why the prophet was preaching I I
[45:03] was
[45:04] heard but now I
[45:07] see I heard this before yeah but I
[45:11] really want to see that's why I went to

[45:19] amen and you know what
[45:22] happened there was a
[45:24] woman from
[45:26] sha the queen of shivba heard this
[45:30] message

[45:38] Shiva uh first king chapter
[45:43] 4:29 Oh no just a second um uh let's go
[45:47] back let's go back to first king
[45:49] 4:29 I really want to jump
[45:54] ahead
[45:56] and God gave Solomon
[45:59] wisdom and
[46:04] understanding exceeding much and largess
[46:09] of heart even as the sand that is on the
[46:14] seashore and Solomon's wisdom excelled
[46:17] the wisdom of all the children of the
[46:22] East
[46:23] Country and all the wisdom of
[46:27] Egypt for he was wiser than old man than
[46:33] Einstein or

[51:05] almost
[51:06] $300
[51:08] million of
[51:11] today that's was a gift

[51:48] the wisdom of Solomon and
[51:51] behold greater than Solomon is here amen
[51:55] amen amen yes amen listen to the
[52:01] wisdom because of the wisdom of

[1:01:26] Solomon as I was reading this full of
[1:01:30] wisdom God gave him the the the the the
[1:01:35] wisdom that that man cannot
[1:01:37] have but there was a question in his
[1:01:43] mind four four mysteries in my mind I I
[1:01:48] can I I can understand the the birds I
[1:01:51] can understand I have wisdom to Rule the
[1:01:54] Kingdom
[1:01:55] but one day he was
[1:01:58] sitting in his throne and he was
[1:02:03] thinking why God cannot reveal this
[1:02:05] mystery to me the mystery of an
[1:02:10] eagle The Mystery of the serpent upon a
[1:02:13] rock the mystery of the sheep in the
[1:02:17] midst of the ocean and the man with a
[1:02:22] maid and I thank God
[1:02:25] from this
[1:02:27] message Revelation 10:7 but in the days
[1:02:31] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:02:34] he began to sound begin to sound all the
[1:02:37] mysteries from Genesis to
[1:02:41] Revelation it's

[1:02:49] restore all
[1:02:52] things and I I
[1:02:55] was when when Solomon was it was mystery

[1:04:17] that
[1:04:19] year it's to me it doesn't have a
[1:04:23] message they will tell you about buil
[1:04:26] buckles about brother
[1:04:28] Branham and that's what we want because
[1:04:31] we don't know brother bham right and he
[1:04:34] was a prophet he went to the Sabino
[1:04:36] Canyon the sword came down but then
[1:04:39] here's we want to see
[1:04:41] Eagles if you're an eagle I one day I I
[1:04:44] went to the uh north of the Philippines
[1:04:47] to to go to the convention and I cannot
[1:04:50] find the I cannot find the church and
[1:04:53] what I did I shout Like an
[1:04:59] Eagle because in my mind if ice cream
[1:05:03] Like an Eagle they will they will hear
[1:05:10] it I
[1:05:12] was when I read the story of an
[1:05:16] eagle you know the story of an eagle you
[1:05:19] know the you you always hear this the
[1:05:22] farmer saw an egg
[1:05:24] and he he put the the egg to the chicken
[1:05:28] uh Nest or the chicken uh how do you
[1:05:31] call that joined with a chicken eggs and
[1:05:34] all of them the same hatch
[1:05:37] together but this
[1:05:40] Eagle something wrong with him he's
[1:05:44] bigger he cannot really know how to
[1:05:47] scratch the
[1:05:49] food and once she find this the eagle
[1:05:52] find a a
[1:05:54] worm he cannot swallow that something in
[1:05:59] in in his stomach that cannot eat the
[1:06:03] food that the chickens
[1:06:06] eat and then this he always he always
[1:06:11] recognized something something wrong
[1:06:15] because the mama Eagle gathered all the
[1:06:17] time her
[1:06:19] cheeks and they they don't want him to
[1:06:22] the to they don't want him to join with
[1:06:25] them but you know what's the message
[1:06:27] what's the meeting all
[1:06:29] about
[1:06:31] please tell Junior Eagle that he is not
[1:06:36] an eagle tell him that he's a chicken
[1:06:38] all the time always tell him you're a
[1:06:41] chicken brother you're my my precious
[1:06:43] brother but you are a chicken you're not
[1:06:46] something else and he they always tell
[1:06:49] that to him because you know why the
[1:06:52] mama Eagle had a revelation
[1:06:55] that if the eagle know who he is the
[1:06:59] eagle will eat the
[1:07:02] chickens right that's what the mama
[1:07:05] Eagle wants to tell to the children
[1:07:07] don't let him know his
[1:07:10] position because we our lives is in
[1:07:16] danger and Solomon cannot understand
[1:07:19] that because it's not in his
[1:07:21] time his time just to hard to Rule the
[1:07:25] Kingdom but God gave us a revelation
[1:07:29] that you need to go up higher all the
[1:07:31] time don't stay in this world there's
[1:07:35] nothing in
[1:07:40] here beautiful serpent upon a
[1:07:48] rock that's the correct time over there
[1:07:52] okay serpent upon on the Rock You Know
[1:07:55] serpent is a
[1:07:58] cursed and I was thinking I was about
[1:08:01] about this uh about the book of numbers
[1:08:05] when when when
[1:08:07] Moses was in the
[1:08:10] wilderness Jesus was in the
[1:08:13] wilderness he was
[1:08:15] following all the time in your in in
[1:08:19] your brothers think about this yeah and
[1:08:24] if you're down he's there if you're up
[1:08:27] he's always there because He follows his
[1:08:31] people amen am when Joseph when he was
[1:08:36] in prison he was
[1:08:38] there when Jesus when when Joseph was in
[1:08:42] the pit he was there when Joseph was in
[1:08:45] the throne he was
[1:08:47] there he's always here all the time
[1:08:51] thank you I will never leave you nor
[1:08:53] forsake you I'm I will be with you all
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:59] time brother uh
[1:09:02] Billy he gave me a an idea he said tell
[1:09:07] to the Pakistani
[1:09:09] Brothers if we can have a youth
[1:09:12] camp and you know
[1:09:15] what that Pakistani brother was so happy
[1:09:20] that he broke out in
[1:09:22] tears he said brother I will tell you
[1:09:27] the message came here in
[1:09:29] 1972 but we don't know about Youth Camp
[1:09:34] and this Youth Camp is our first Youth
[1:09:38] Camp please don't tell me you will
[1:09:41] cancel it I said brother I will not we
[1:09:44] will have a youth
[1:09:46] camp thank you brother Billy for give me
[1:09:49] an
[1:09:51] idea because he's supposed to be the
[1:09:54] preachers over there so
[1:09:58] now but then when sin came
[1:10:02] in that rock became a
[1:10:06] serpent that rock became a
[1:10:11] cursed and that
[1:10:14] rock Moses was ordered to put that
[1:10:18] serpent on the breast the pool of
[1:10:22] brass and meaning to say the sin is
[1:10:27] already judged amen and all the people
[1:10:31] that was beaten by the snakes if they
[1:10:34] look up on that
[1:10:38] serpent look and live my brothers live
[1:10:43] look to Jesus Christ and live don't let
[1:10:46] me sing
[1:10:49] Philippino look and leave because he is
[1:10:52] the one
[1:10:55] the only one to look
[1:11:01] amen the prophet said here in John
[1:11:03] chapter 3 or the Bible said here and as
[1:11:05] Moses lifted up the
[1:11:09] serpent in the wilderness even so must
[1:11:12] the son of man lip it
[1:11:16] up my from from the Bible That's why
[1:11:19] when when the two men from emus was
[1:11:22] screaming was crying because they
[1:11:25] crucified their lord they were kicking
[1:11:28] rocks they were they they don't know
[1:11:30] what to do but then here was the
[1:11:34] god came and say don't you know all the
[1:11:40] prophets the the
[1:11:42] writers was writing about me and you
[1:11:45] cannot open your ey you cannot you
[1:11:47] cannot understand the scriptures
[1:11:51] amen and now it's it's the same thing
[1:11:54] here in the
[1:11:56] message when the
[1:11:58] seventh late later
[1:12:01] later the ship in the midst of the Sea
[1:12:05] and the
[1:12:06] anchor uh the the ship the anchor is a
[1:12:09] symbol of safety and
[1:12:12] hope and
[1:12:15] security but now when the sea is blowing
[1:12:19] this is the message of the Prophet
[1:12:20] Joseph meeting his Brethren he said when
[1:12:23] the sea is blowing and stormy did you
[1:12:27] ever guess maybe some of you has never
[1:12:29] been privileged to see a ship anchored
[1:12:33] oh my I've BR them when they throw out a
[1:12:37] sea anchor like that until the little
[1:12:41] craft couldn't even go over to the top
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] wave it would go through the wave but as
[1:12:50] long as the anchor healed that that's
[1:12:53] all that makes any
[1:12:56] difference whether you go over it under
[1:13:00] it around it or around it or through it
[1:13:07] doesn't matter The Anchor Holds that's
[1:13:10] the way when the when storm of Life
[1:13:13] begin to shake us when when may have to
[1:13:17] go through we may have to go over under
[1:13:21] around but just
[1:13:24] let that anchor hold within the veil
[1:13:27] Amen to the
[1:13:29] Unseen when we don't even just exactly
[1:13:33] where it

[1:19:14] woman married this
[1:19:17] man and you know what happened the

[1:20:28] brother Robert I become
[1:20:31] handsome because of him that's
[1:20:34] right can you see that am and now the
[1:20:39] message
[1:20:42] said the message
[1:20:47] said if
[1:20:49] you re if you see the the explan
[1:20:52] explation of the four
[1:20:54] Mysteries you can see it's all Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ all the
[1:20:59] way why Solomon cannot understand that
[1:21:04] because he did not see the Lord he had
[1:21:08] an
[1:21:09] idea that one day he will be the son of
[1:21:13] David and Jesus is the son of David why
[1:21:18] he had so many wives why he had thousand
[1:21:21] wives because one day the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:25] Christ is a many membered
[1:21:29] body the prophet said here in the
[1:21:33] message this is the rising of the
[1:21:36] sun it is the rising of the sun
[1:21:39] 1965 he is the one who opened those
[1:21:44] seals he is those seals for the whole
[1:21:48] word of God is Christ amen and Christ is
[1:21:56] the
[1:21:58] seals that was open that is the opening
[1:22:03] of seals then revealing what is the
[1:22:06] opening of the seals revealing Jesus
[1:22:11] Christ when there was a silent in heaven
[1:22:14] for half an hour can you
[1:22:17] feel this this sequence of events even
[1:22:21] the ministers here in the message AG
[1:22:23] still
[1:22:24] believes that brother brandham is not
[1:22:27] Revelation 10:7 there's so many
[1:22:29] ministers preaching this message don't
[1:22:32] say that the opening of the seal is
[1:22:38] opened maybe they did not read us the
[1:22:40] rising of the
[1:22:42] Sun come on but when there was a half
[1:22:46] hour of Silence in heaven he came down
[1:22:50] and there was no Angels was
[1:22:53] singing it was silence for half an hour
[1:22:57] but then when he came down he came down
[1:23:00] with an open book in his hands amen
[1:23:03] that's why when when when the prophet
[1:23:05] was preaching about the Seven
[1:23:08] Seals he did not really reveal the seals
[1:23:12] he was silent it was silent but then
[1:23:15] when he preached the Crist is the
[1:23:17] mystery of God revealed he revealed
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ
[1:23:23] the power from the
[1:23:25] father gave all to the Son and the power
[1:23:29] from the son gave all to the
[1:23:32] church see the position my brothers and
[1:23:35] sisters of the
[1:23:36] Believers that the the Christ the the
[1:23:40] the Christ right now is in you that's
[1:23:42] right that's right
[1:23:45] right that's why there's so many clanes
[1:23:48] in the message when I call the brother
[1:23:51] that I'm going to the p pistan everybody
[1:23:54] was telling against this brother was
[1:23:56] telling against this brother I said
[1:23:58] brother I will tell you
[1:24:01] something bride cannot persecute
[1:24:05] bride how can I say I don't like this
[1:24:08] toenails or toes not toenails I cut my
[1:24:12] two Nails all the
[1:24:14] time
[1:24:19] amen the prophet said in the message
[1:24:23] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:24:25] is the principal them of the Bible he
[1:24:28] was in the prophets he was in the Psalms
[1:24:32] he was in the history of the Bible the
[1:24:35] Bible is a prophetic book it's his
[1:24:38] historical book it's a book of love it's
[1:24:41] a book of songs it's a book of life and
[1:24:45] there you are find Christ or if you find
[1:24:48] Christ he was in the prophets he he was
[1:24:52] in the Psalms he was in history he also
[1:24:56] in the Bible is the things that is to
[1:25:00] come so he was before until after what
[1:25:05] does it that make him make make him then
[1:25:09] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:25:14] is the alpha the in between and the
[1:25:18] Omega he is him all the
[1:25:21] way
[1:25:23] I think I I will start preaching now
[1:25:27] now
[1:25:29] remember when the prophet was revealing
[1:25:32] this message he said the
[1:25:35] Elohim that self-existing one became the
[1:25:40] all existing one because the Elohim
[1:25:44] created
[1:25:46] Jehovah created
[1:25:50] Elohim Now what is eloh Elohim means god
[1:25:55] with his people or or Jehovah means god
[1:25:58] with his
[1:25:58] children god with his
[1:26:01] people it's a
[1:26:03] family in his mind I want to be a Healer
[1:26:08] I want to be a father I want to be a
[1:26:10] teacher I want to be a
[1:26:14] leader amen amen he wants to be a
[1:26:20] husband he is the one from the book of
[1:26:24] Psalms from the
[1:26:26] history to the
[1:26:29] Bible the prophet said
[1:26:34] here he said is Isaiah wrote 6 66 books
[1:26:41] of the Bible he said I see Isaiah said I
[1:26:45] see a
[1:26:47] counselor a prince of peace the Mighty
[1:26:51] God the Everlasting father that's what
[1:26:54] Isaiah look away and saw and Daniel when
[1:26:58] he was uh in the in the in the um uh in
[1:27:04] the uh Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar he said
[1:27:07] one time I was standing and I saw the
[1:27:11] ending of gen Gentile dispensation I saw
[1:27:14] the image that NE nzar had dreamed I saw
[1:27:19] how each one would suc succeed
[1:27:23] the other and they come down and they
[1:27:25] look and see that wasn't going to happen
[1:27:28] to the end he saw Jesus was a stone hued
[1:27:33] out of the mountain without hands that
[1:27:36] crushed the Gentile kingdoms and
[1:27:39] Nebuchadnezzar and and when he put the
[1:27:42] children of Israel to the fiery
[1:27:45] furnace he said but when he looked away
[1:27:48] and saw
[1:27:50] Jesus he was the the forth man that was
[1:27:53] in the fiery furnace and did keep all
[1:27:56] the heat of his obedient servants that's
[1:28:01] what Nebuchadnezzar saw and Ezekiel Saw
[1:28:04] the Wheel in the middle of the wheel it
[1:28:07] was Jesus Christ amen it was Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ in the Book of Revelation it was
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ in the Book of James
[1:28:16] amen he is our healer
[1:28:21] amen

[1:28:26] Revelation he is the soon and coming
[1:28:29] King he is the king of kings and the
[1:28:31] Lord of lords that's right Jesus Christ
[1:28:34] all the
[1:28:36] time I pulled out this from the
[1:28:46] internet I still have time five more

[1:33:31] Christ was ever a people so beaten and
[1:33:34] purged as the bride of
[1:33:37] Christ surely she is failing up the
