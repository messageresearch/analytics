We are just excited about what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got some things in my heart for Sunday. So I really want you to be praying, asking God to come and speak to our hearts. You see, saints of God, many times we see what God has done. We look back and we see a historical God. We look in the future and see what God is going to do. But many times what we do is we miss God on what he's doing. I'm interested to know about our position and our place because when you get into your rightful position, you have power for service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham out of the promised land. See, God didn't even allow him time. So it wound up he had to get back into that promised land. when he did than the promises of God. God help us to stay right where God can deal with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The promised land is the message of the hour where every promise for Amen. a rapturing faith, a quickening power to get us out of here. Brother Bram said, "Rapturing faith is laying in those messages." &gt;&gt; So, you got to get into those messages to have God quicken to you that faith, huh, to get us out of here. God bless you all. Uh this evening we're going to have our brother James. Let's all stand together if you will. Sing another song. Come on up here. Brother Austin lead us in another song if you would please. You are beautiful beyond description. Too marvelous for words, too wonderful for comprehension like nothing ever seen or heard. Who can grasp strenged wisdom? Who can fathom the depth of your love? You are beautiful beyond description. Oh mestyone and I stand I standing on you. I stand I stand on you God to all praise you. I stand in awe of you. You are beautiful beyond description and yet I trust you in agony affliction and you're cut off that I might grasp such tender compassion. You can fill this mercy so great. You are beautiful. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Lamb of God who died for me. And I stand I stand on you. I stand I stand on you. God all praising you. I stand on you. Oh, I stand I stand before you. I stand I stand before you. Holy God, you all praises you. I stand in all of you. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and our hearts. Truly, Father, we stand in awe of you. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are humbled that you seem fit to choose. Choose us, Lord. that you called us out of our darkness. And &gt;&gt; Lord, how thankful we are to be your people, &gt;&gt; Lord, that we would know you in the power of your resurrection. That &gt;&gt; Father, as we stand here in awe of you and your goodness and your mercy in our lives, how thankful and blessed we are. &gt;&gt; Lord, we can't thank you enough. We can't praise you enough, Lord. We can't worship you enough for all the things that you've seen fit to do in our lives, &gt;&gt; Lord, in the good times and in the bad times. We praise you. &gt;&gt; And Father, once again, Lord, we have gathered, Lord, in this tabernacle, &gt;&gt; Lord, asking that you would speak to your people, that you would come by our way, that you would walk the aisles. That Lord, we know that your people have needs. They have desires in their lives. And Lord, there's nothing I can do as a man. But Father, you sent your word and it heals the people. &gt;&gt; It brings deliverance to your people. &gt;&gt; Father, would you relax my spirit? Would you quieten it? Oh God, &gt;&gt; would you come and take control? &gt;&gt; Would you have preeminence? And Lord, use my lips as a mouthpiece. And Father, would you soften the hearts of your children, Lord, that as the word goes forth and they begin to receive the word, may they take it into their heart, oh God, &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would have your way in this service, and we'll be sure to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. You love the Lord this evening. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to St. John 14. Before I get started, I had to use a piece of paper to remind me because the last couple of times I kind of just took off and I forgot to uh thank you all um the last time we had spoke to thank you for um the gifts and the the things that you gave us there at the end of the year. as we had our little one, mom and baby are doing well and uh she's definitely been the best baby out of all all three of them. And so I'm thankful for that. And yet you forget how uh sleepless nights and those things that you think you put behind you, but that's okay. She's sleeping at least three hours, so I'm thankful for that. And we want to thank those that have helped with the boys um taking them for the day and stuff. Those little things have they it means a lot and helps us and you know when you go from one to two kids or you know two to three you become outnumbered and so then you got to go to zone defense and it's no longer man-to-man. But hey, we're figuring it out. And we do want to thank you all for the food that you guys have given us. And it's hard to start the new year on a diet when you guys are showing up with the good stuff and all the desserts. And we do want to thank you for that. So let's turn to the scriptures now. St. John 14 and verse 5. And Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If he had known me, he had should have known my father also, and from hence you know him, and have seen him. And Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. And Jesus saith unto him, Have I been with Have I been so long with you, and yet thou sayest that thou not know me, Philillip? And he that hath seen me hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then showest the Father? Believest thou that I am in my Father, and the Father in me, and the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works. &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in my Father, and the Father in me, or else believe me for the work, the very work's sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do, shall ye do also. And a greater works than these shall ye do, because I go unto my father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. And if you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to read Psalms 46 and10. And it says, "Be still and know that I am God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening. Be still and know that I am God. And so we see here in St. John chapter 14 in Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we would know not whether thou goest or how can we know the way? There's a junction here that is happening that he's going to leave his disciples. And he has a question. And I can only imagine that if you put yourselves there in the disciples shoes that this master that they've been following, this man that they've called Lord, the one the savior of the world that they've been following, he's telling them now that he's going to leave them and he's going to go. But now the question to them is where do we go? &gt;&gt; How do we know the way? &gt;&gt; What's next? What is going to happen? And I'm sure that that that was the question even when the prophet came and many followed him and you know they would follow this prophet of this hour and the word would come forth and they knew the things that he was speaking and the prophecies that he was saying and then the prophet goes off the scene and there now now there's a question of what next? &gt;&gt; What do we do? Where do we go? &gt;&gt; But yet Jesus says I am the way, &gt;&gt; the truth and the life. And here Philillip says and he asks Jesus he says show us the father and it'll suffice us. Show us who the father is and then we'll know. And he says Phillip have I not been with you so long? Have I not sojourned with you? Have I not shown these things? Have I not taught you my ways? &gt;&gt; And yet you don't know who I am. That begs the question of how many people are sitting in message churches that are sitting on pews and going to church day in and day out or they show up on a Wednesday and they're wondering, "Show us the father. Show us what's next. Show us where to go." And he's saying, "Have I not been with you so long? Have I not revealed myself to you? Have I not sent my word unto you and unfolded and made myself known unto you?" &gt;&gt; The problem isn't with the father revealing himself. is with us catching an understanding, a revelation of who he is. &gt;&gt; Show us the father and it'll suffice us. You see, we have ones that have attended churches, sang in the choir. How can message people sojourn with us and come to church and a and fellowship with us? And then after so many years even preachers in the gospel and you see them faithful men of God held meetings, powerful ministries &gt;&gt; and they walk away. &gt;&gt; Did they ever know him or was it an intellectual understanding of knowing who he was? Was it a thing that God gave them a gift and they would begin to preach the gospel where they can sing real well and they can do all these things for the kingdom of God, but yet they begin to take glory unto themselves. &gt;&gt; How do you walk away? Because let me ask you, if something is revealed unto you and you know who he is, how do you walk away from the truth? That's right. &gt;&gt; That ones that would try TO MISLEAD NOW THAT HAVE PREACHED the gospel and now they would hold meetings down away from a church or travel around to try to disprove. And if YOU HAVE A QUESTION WITH the message, come to this meeting. &gt;&gt; Where are they taking you, saints? &gt;&gt; What is the purpose behind it all? Because if THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING, HOW DO HOW do they know where they're taking you? Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't take you somewhere that they've never been or they don't know. &gt;&gt; But let us stick to the word of God that's been revealed unto us. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." &gt;&gt; And as long as you stick with that, you know where you're going. You know the direction. that it's no longer a intellectual understanding or a human conception of knowing the father because you see people out in the world they have a limited understanding of who God is of who God is. And the title this evening would be the God I know. &gt;&gt; The God I know is the God I serve. Very good. &gt;&gt; And this thought came to me because I was talking with a man that was my age and we were just talking back and forth. And as I we we begin to just talk, you know, just about the world and things happening and all that, you know, what Trump's doing and all in a in a panic. If you don't you don't have a security in the message of the hour or knowing who God is, there's a fear and there's a worry that's happening around right now because they don't know what lays ahead. And whenever you come, you have men that raise up and you know that this guy, he's my age, he's a little bit younger, but he has kids. And you begin to understand and it's no longer just him and his wife, right? There's no longer just thinking you and her. But then whenever you have kids, you have a world that is going to be raised up and these kids are going to grow up under. &gt;&gt; The morals and the things of this world that you can't tell me that the people out there don't identify and can recognize the direction in which this world is headed. &gt;&gt; They know that there's a a condemnation coming. There's a destruction happening. That the morals being ripped out of society that it can't last going in this direction. And so we just began to talk and he he began to share just about how crazy the world is and you know the schools and his kids and you know the the classrooms that he you know the issues that are arising and I just threw something simple out. I just said well I'm thankful that I'm a Christian and I have somewhere that I'm headed. &gt;&gt; And he says oh you believe in that kind of stuff huh James? &gt;&gt; I said yeah I believe in God. you believe in God? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he says, you know, I've never been raised in church. I've never understood and I've never been taught. And I begin to think about this because YOU CAN'T CONDEMN SOMEBODY WHO'S never been shown. &gt;&gt; Be too many times we can get critical of the outside world and how dare they this and how they think this way or they're going in this and they've never been shown the truth. They've never been told. &gt;&gt; And so I just shared with him and he asked me, "Oh, you believe in God?" I said, "Yeah, I do." And I said, "Do you believe in him?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Well, I've never really, but now that I have a family," and he's like, "I know how you are and you're upright and you know, you do business right." He says, "You know, I I kind of admire that." And he says, "You going in this direction that I want to stick my family in a church. People out there are searching for church." &gt;&gt; And he says, "I want to raise my kids to do right, to know Bible stories, and to be able to understand and have good morals about them." And so I asked him, "How do you think you why are you here?" is what I asked him. &gt;&gt; And what is your purpose in being here? Because many times they want to ask well well do you believe in God and do you believe how do you believe in the big bang and do you believe in all these things but whenever you put it in their lap find out where they believe find out where they stand. So I asked him, "Why are you here and what purpose do you have here?" And he says, "Well, I guess as a man you want to have kids and you want to raise them right and have good morals and you want to lead a family and leave a legacy." I says, "That's exactly what God desires. That's exactly what God wants. &gt;&gt; That it's NOT A GOD JUST WAY out in the universe." And many TIMES THAT A GOD that they are taught or they are shown is some god out there that he created it or he didn't create it. And then AND YOU KNOW BACK TALKING BACK AND FORTH HE'S LIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WE weren't created from a fungus? &gt;&gt; How do you know? And I said it's harder for me to believe that we came from a fungus than to believe that God created all of mankind. &gt;&gt; True. that I whenever you begin to take the simplicity of the nature and life and you begin to put it back in their lap and even the simple example of brother Brandham talking about trees and the intellect in the in the intelligence that what is in that fruit tree to bear forth that fruit &gt;&gt; at what TIME AND AT WHAT SEASON? WHY don't these fruits just bear FORTH ALL THE TIME? THERE'S A TIME and a season and there's a winter and ALL THESE THINGS. WHAT IS THE INTELLIGENCE THAT'S TAILING NATURE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS? DO YOU THINK IT'S SOME fungus that was created that has this intelligence to be able to do all that? &gt;&gt; It's impossible. But whenever you begin to put the simplicity of the gospel AND YOU BEGIN TO SHARE WITH THEM HOW SIMPLE THIS IS OF KNOWING A GOD THAT IT'S NOT SOMEBODY OUT THERE, IT'S NOT SOME RELIGION. IT'S NOT HOW MANY HELL MARYS I CAN SAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY TIMES I GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; It's not a religion, saints. But when you realize it's a love relationship with Jesus Christ, THAT WHEN THEY OUT THERE CAN IDENTIFY there's something different about this man, &gt;&gt; that this man truly knows God. &gt;&gt; Because many times you ask them or somebody will ask you, they're ready for a religious answer. But whenever you take a natural example and you begin to explain it to them, their eyes become open, they begin to see and identify that that God is a God I can serve. That's exactly what God has desired is a family of fellowship that he had all these attributes all these things that were in him and many and he even asked me why why does good things h or bad things happen to good people? Why does God allow it? Even as we're sitting here tonight, my wife's cousin has two newborn babies that were born at a pound each, premature, and yet they're nursing them. And they're and you ask me, "How could I HAVE SUCH A A NORMAL BIRTH?" And I thank God for all of that. But yet, you take another situation and there's children that are being birthed into situations. There's things that are happening to good people. Why? &gt;&gt; Why does cancer come upon a believer? Is it because they don't have enough faith? Is it because they did something that they didn't deserve? Or many times we begin to blame our things that we go through and we begin to wonder, God, is it me? Am I doing something wrong? But yet I found this quote and I know he says I'm going to approach it a little different from a standpoint coming to a place. He says why do we come? Why do we come to these troubles? What makes these things come? Why should a Christian ever be perplexed? Why would wouldn't not everything just run perfectly for a Christian? But it doesn't and we know it. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice if our salvation once you come to Christ, you put it on cruise control, &gt;&gt; no battles, no worries. &gt;&gt; Everything ran smooth. Everything was a paradise. Wouldn't that be nice? &gt;&gt; And sometimes we have more troubles when we come to when we become a Christian &gt;&gt; than we did when we were sinners. Of course, it is written, "Many is the afflictions of the righteous, but God deliverth them from them all." Amen. &gt;&gt; God deliverth them from all saints. It don't matter your afflictions tonight you're going through. IT DON'T MATTER THE SICKNESS, THE CANCER. IT DON'T MATTER THE DOCTOR'S REPORT. GOD deliverth them from them all. &gt;&gt; God promised many afflictions, strange feelings, and strange things that would be beyond our understanding. &gt;&gt; But it's always done for our good. Wow. &gt;&gt; Can't understand it because if we did then it would not be faith to us. &gt;&gt; We would go with an understanding. But we do it we and we have it and we believe by faith his word. That's that's it going to work some good in good thing for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could grasp that all of our tr troubles there's none of us immune from them. Right? &gt;&gt; If we could realize that those things are for our good. &gt;&gt; None of us are immune from it, saints. &gt;&gt; That if you're going in one valley or you're coming out of a valley, there's always something that you're going TO GO THROUGH. YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A battle that you're going to have to face. There's always going to be a trial coming your way. &gt;&gt; But when you know who God is, and when you know he he deliverth from from from us all, he he delivered every single one of them. It don't matter what comes our way. We know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That none of us were immune from it. We can look in the Bible that none not even the the great patriarchs of the Bible. We can look at all the prophets, the ones that would run in the midst of trouble, THE ONES THAT WOULD LIE AND THEY would steal and they would they would do all these things that you would think that wouldn't be coming to a Christian. And yet we read in OUR BIBLE THAT GOD WROTE AN IMPERFECT Bible or a a perfect Bible of imperfect people. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF GOD WROTE A BIBLE OF A PERFECT PEOPLE, THERE WAS ALL THESE AND Abraham did this and he never sinned and he never failed and Moses did this and he never faltered and he did this ONE DID THIS AND JOB worry and it was ALL GOOD. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I couldn't ATTAIN TO IT. YOU AND I COULDN'T RELATE TO IT. THERE WOULD be no relationship with his word because you couldn't identify with it &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT. BUT THEN WHEN THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT MAKES A MISTAKE AND THEY FALL DOWN, WHEN THEY FALL DOWN, THEY GET BACK UP. YOU CAN SAY, "THERE IT IS. THAT'S ME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO I AM. I MADE A MISTAKE. I KNOW I DID, BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. GET BACK UP." &gt;&gt; And he staggered not at the promise of God. Those are promises that you can identify with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I see when I read my Bible. &gt;&gt; Because if you look to find the the the perfection in it, it's hard to attain in it. &gt;&gt; But those that make mistakes, those that fall short, &gt;&gt; that's what your Bible is. I was listening to brother Brandham. He says, "God wrote an imperfect Bible or a perfect Bible with imperfect people, but he sent a perfect one by the shedding of his blood would make you and I perfect." &gt;&gt; THAT HE SMOKED THAT MASTERPIECE WHICH WAS CHRIST ON CALVARY. THAT IN SMITING THAT MASTERPIECE, NOT ONLY DID HE HE he smid that masterpiece, but then HE CREATED MANY MORE MASTERPIECE BY THE SHEDDING OF HIS BLOOD. &gt;&gt; That's the God I serve. Let's turn to Matthew 16. Matthew 16 and verse 13 he says when Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi and he asked his disciples whom do men say that I the son of man am and they answered him saying thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others and Jeremas and one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom do you say that I am? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is this evening? Is it dad's religion or mom's religion? Why are you here this evening? &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is? &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." And I said also unto thee, Thou art Simon Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, thou shalt bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand when he said, "THOU ART CHRIST THE SON," WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS? CHRIST ISN'T ONLY JUST ASKING a question just to ask FOR CONVERSATION PIECES. NO, HE'S ASKING THE QUESTION TO SEE if they understand, &gt;&gt; if they have a revelation of who he is. &gt;&gt; Because you can ask the different ones and all the sayings of this of this message. Well, what is HIS PURPOSE? AND WHO IS BROTHER BRANDHAM? AND MAYBE SOME SAY HE'S THIS AND some say he's that, &gt;&gt; but who do you say Christ is? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is this message to you? &gt;&gt; When you make it personal to yourself, not only is he saying flesh and blood hasn't revealed this unto you. No man gave you this revelation, Austin. I can't give you a revelation. BUT WHEN GOD REVEALS IT TO YOU your himself, when God comes down and makes himself known, WHEN HE SHOWS YOU personally who HE IS, &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN TAKE THAT AWAY. BUT UPON THIS ROCK, NOT ONLY DID HE SAY THAT NO MAN CAN GIVE IT TO YOU, BUT HE SAYS, "THOU ART PETER." He doesn't not only tell him who he is, but he shows him who he is. &gt;&gt; He says, "Thou art Peter." And upon this rock of revelation, I'm going to build my church. &gt;&gt; As I said, people have a conception of God or what God is. And we know from the definition that God is an object of worship. And so that definition an object of worship that anything that we begin to worship anything that we give our praise to that we give our attention to it becomes a god unto us that if we don't give our time and AND OUR WORSHIP TO GOD HIMSELF then other things begin to take its place other idols begin to take its place &gt;&gt; things happen and you begin to worship other things and we be and SATAN TRIES TO DRAW our attention from worshiping the one true God. And if we apply it an object of worship, people who are worshiped in this day, ones that just begin to these people of sports stars and movie stars and ones that have an influence in in young people's lives, and they don't even realize that they're worshiping this God. They're giving this praise and attention that a man doesn't even they don't know him personally. They don't know his favorite meal. They don't know anything about this God other than they worship him for the thing he they he does for them. If he's a sports star, how many points can he get? And yet these people want to identify with their God. But does their God identify with them? Does their God identify with them? &gt;&gt; No. He can care less. &gt;&gt; He can care less if you follow him on Instagram. He can care less if you go to his games or his concert. He could care less &gt;&gt; because there's somebody else going to give him worship. There's somebody else going TO GIVE HIM PRAISE. SOMEBODY ELSE is going to pay THE DOLLAR TO GO watch him or to to SEE HIM SING OR WHATEVER it is. He could care less that God has no identification with you. But yet, our God is something totally different. &gt;&gt; Our God is somebody totally different. Not only DOES HE WANT TO COME DOWN AND IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH YOU AND YOU IDENTIFY BACK to him, &gt;&gt; God wants to find his identification in you and I. &gt;&gt; He wants to identify with you. &gt;&gt; He wants to see if you are a son or a daughter of God. If you are living according to his ordinances, as long as these people and as long as the gods of this world, as long as they're getting paid the big bucks and the money's coming in, oh, they thank God. They know God. They know God. And they thank God. You can hear them at every award when they come forward. First, I want to thank God and then I want to thank my parents and my wife. But how much does God really mean to them? &gt;&gt; Do they really know who he is? &gt;&gt; Or is it just words that they say because humanly we know that there is a great God out there &gt;&gt; who bestows his blessings upon us. But yet our return in our sacrifice in living for him and knowing him, it doesn't matter what he does for us, but it's what we can do for him. &gt;&gt; That them out there, IF THEY TOOK AWAY THE MONEY AND THEY TOOK AWAY THE FAME, WHERE would they be? WOULD THEY STILL THANK GOD in the condition that they're in? &gt;&gt; If they had to go BE A NORMAL PERSON, WOULD THEY STILL THANK God and him giving him those blessings? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or are they just thankful for the things that God has blessed them with? &gt;&gt; But I know a God in Exodus 20 in verse 6. I am the Lord thy God which hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the under the earth. And thou shalt not bow down thy thyself to them nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy God am jealous God. &gt;&gt; He's jealous saints. He's jealous over you with a godly jealousy. He's jealous over you. &gt;&gt; He's jealous in the way you dress, the way you conduct yourself. He's jealous in the way that you live your day in and your day out. He says, "Visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children under the third gen and fourth generation of them that hate hateth me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments." What is iniquity? Knowing what's wrong, right, and not doing it. Do you understand the responsibility of us fathers even in this day that he's saying I I visited the iniquity of all those unto a second and third or third and fourth generation because of the iniquities of their fathers of the things that they knew what right to do and didn't do it. So then you see that there's a generation that's rising up under them UNDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF who what their fathers chose in knowing God or not knowing God in serving God or not serving God &gt;&gt; because he's a jealous God and he's STILL SHOW BUT HE'S STILL showing mercy tonight and God not only wants to identify yourself with him but God wants to identify with you &gt;&gt; and when he identifies with you in knowing a God, you better know what he likes and what he don't like. &gt;&gt; When you know somebody, you want to know what they like and what they don't like. &gt;&gt; Because it's going to do you no good that if you take if I was to take my wife OUT AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE STEAK AND I TAKE MY WIFE OUT and I'm going to give you a the best dinner and I'm going to take you out and we're going to have a wonderful time and I take her to a steakhouse. Yes, I did a good deed, but my wife is not a steakhouse person. She doesn't like a steakhouse. So, do I really know her? Because in serving her, I want to KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE. I WANT TO DO IT TO MY BEST ABILITY. IT'S NOT GOD JUST OUT THERE WANDERING and I'm going to serve God. But then we don't do the things he likes and doesn't like. a few things that I just began to find some scripture on that God loves a cheerful giver. &gt;&gt; God loves a cheerful giver. He loves those that love uh one another because he says in loving one another, you also love me. &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES TO PROVE HIS CHILDREN. But yet he loves to do it. But then we can find in the scripture in 2 Corinthians 9 and7 or in Proverbs 6, he says, "These things does the Lord hate. Yay. Seven, an abomination unto him, a proud look, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devisesth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that lith, and he that sweth discord among the brethren. &gt;&gt; Discord. Yeah. He hates all the other attributes of sin, all those things. But look here, he hates a lying tongue. He hates a deceitful heart. He hates one that is going around spreading gossip one with his brother. Those things the Lord thy God hateth. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in reading this because whenever you identify, if you really want to go get to know somebody, find out what they don't like. You see, his word is a road map on how we can find ways that we can love him back and reflect our love. And in Matthew 7 and 21, he says, ' Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into his kingdom, the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say unto me, in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? In thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. &gt;&gt; You workers of iniquity. Ones they thought they knew. They knew who God was. They thought they were serving God to the best of their ability. They maybe it's a denominational path. He's doing everything that he can. &gt;&gt; He's serving God. He's doing good deeds. And from an outward natural uh uh viewpoint, you would say that that is a man of God. &gt;&gt; He's doing everything for the kingdom. He's faithful. He's true. He's doing all these things. HE'S HE HAS A GOOD, SOLID church and he thinks he knows God, but yet when it comes to that judgment day and he says, "Lord, Lord, didn't I do all these works? Didn't I do all these wonders? Didn't I do didn't I didn't I raise up the lame? Didn't I do all these miracles in your name?" And he says, "Depart from me. I never knew you. I never knew you. And this word knew, we're going to get into it. &gt;&gt; Workers of iniquity. But he says here in the Patm Pergamian churches, he says, "Then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity." Jesus did not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by the way of men. But he did deny ever knowing them. These weren't backsliders. These were wicked, ungenerated reprobate. These were the seed of Satan. &gt;&gt; And there it is. He says, "You can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit born, spiritfilled." No, sir. He says, "I will admit that that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit doing mighty acts." He says, "It is not the evidence of the individual being spiritfilled." Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations, &gt;&gt; be careful, saints. Do you understand what he's saying here? &gt;&gt; Just because you do all the wonderful things of God and you can get a minister and YOU CAN PREACH THE HOUSE, HE CAN DO ALL THE MIRACLES, he won't deny THAT IT WAS SPIRIT, HOLY GHOST FILLED BECAUSE ONLY GOD CAN DO THOSE KIND of things. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was in the day back in the day of our Lord. It is receiving the word of truth for that day in which you live. &gt;&gt; Jesus never did stress the importance of the work as he did the word. He knew, listen to what God knew. He knew that if the people got the word that the works would follow. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me tell you this evening, I DON'T HAVE TO GET YOU TO THE WORKS. I DON'T HAVE TO GET YOU TO GET WORKED UP AND TO WONDER AND GET ALL THESE MANIFESTATIONS HAPPENING AMONGST US. NO, I JUST GOT TO GET YOU TO THE WORD. And when THE WORD WILL BRING ALL THOSE MANIFESTATIONS. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The Hebrew word yada it means to know but it signifies a deep intimate relational knowledge not just an intellectual fact but encompassing understanding experiencing and being known. You see this word yada as I begin to look into this word yada as you begin to look in throughout the scripture that it pops up even in Genesis 4 and1 and it's and it says and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived. &gt;&gt; It's not an intellectual knowledge. It's not there's got to be something to this knowing than just knowing of A PERSON BECAUSE IF I think of a person it doesn't bring some kind of conception. &gt;&gt; But there's a deeper meaning to this word of &gt;&gt; yada. THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMEBODY PERSONAL. YOU HAVE TO BE INTIMATE with them. You have to have a relationship with them. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; You can't have a a conception or intellectual knowledge of of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. YOU CAN'T HAVE SOME REVELATION OF, OH, I MIGHT HAVE THE Holy Ghost and I might not. Why? Because if it's an intellectual uh understanding, let me tell you, YOU'LL BE UP ONE day and out the next. True. &gt;&gt; A hard day comes and you'll wonder if you got it and the next day you won't. &gt;&gt; But yet when you know when you yada when you have an INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WHEN GOD HAS COME DOWN AND HE'S REVEALED himself unto you and you back to him, it don't matter what comes, saints. &gt;&gt; It don't matter the day, the hour. It don't matter the trial. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you know, &gt;&gt; and when you know something, nobody can talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; Nobody can persuade you. Nobody can sway you. Why? Because you've met the person of Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't have a new birth experience intellectually. &gt;&gt; But it is in knowing him. It is in yotting him. Yaying Christ. knowing him personally in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says now God's secret mystery he had before the found the world began. He says now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve. He had a a a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there was there wasn't a moon or star, atom, molecule, anything, not even a fungus. &gt;&gt; He was God. &gt;&gt; He was God. &gt;&gt; But he exactly wasn't at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship. And so in his great mind, he wanted these attributes to be expressed. And in him was love. And in him was father. In him was son. And in him was savior. And in him was to be a healer. And all these great attributes that we see already expressed. They were in God. What a wonderful thing it is that in God he had all these things and all these desires. And yet even some of these attributes, he come and he gave you those attributes. YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW it &gt;&gt; that in you there's a desire if you're unmarried to be a father or to be a mother that in you there's a desire to be a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That right now it doesn't even enter your your intellectual or your understanding right now but yet in due SEASON WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT AND YOU HAVE YOUR SOULMATE AND GOD HAS AN APPOINTED TIME FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENS? an attribute out of you becomes revealed &gt;&gt; because you have this desire &gt;&gt; and you begin to understand the very desire of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That in him was all these attributes and he wanted to express it but he had nobody to share it with. &gt;&gt; He had no way to reveal himself to. What was once a mystery or a question God has made known himself revealing in how he would come down and it's our responsibility to find out what he likes and what he doesn't like. It's our responsibility to create atmospheres within our homes and within our lives that we can nurture that relationship that if you don't ever give God the time of day, how could he ever come down and talk to you? &gt;&gt; How could you ever fall in love with somebody you do not know? &gt;&gt; But it is a desire to make himself known unto you personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's our responsibility to know how he loves and how we can love him back. And I love this quote. He says what we yet to see. He says, "You can't help what you are. Even if you're a sinner, you're not responsible for being a sinner. You're responsible for remaining a sinner. That if YOU STAY IN THAT CURRENT CONDITION, God has made a provided way. But if you stay in that sinner's condition, that's when you become responsible. &gt;&gt; There is a provided way. But to be a sinner, you was born that way. God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner. God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior. &gt;&gt; You refuse to take the right road. He says, "You send yourself to torment. &gt;&gt; You send your own soul to its eternal destination upon free moral agency of your own convictions." God doesn't send anyone to hell. He never did and he never will. Man sends themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the way of salvation. &gt;&gt; He's longsuffering. Doesn't want any anyone to perish. Never wanted it. Right. &gt;&gt; We're not responsible that we were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the world, speaking lies, THAT WE HAVE A SINNER'S NATURE, AND WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE for being a sinner. But if we remain a sinner, then it becomes our responsibility. And let me tell you this evening that YOU WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE TO KNOW IF THERE WAS A GOD OR NOT GOD OR WHAT WHAT WAS OUT THERE. BUT when you come to the knowledge OF ALMIGHTY GOD, NOW YOU BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR KNOWING how he is and learning how to serve him. &gt;&gt; It's your responsibility. &gt;&gt; You see, the problem is that people don't know God. Let's say the God of the Bible. Because what happens over many generations and over church ages and things the viewpoint of God or the person of God becomes warped. How does it become warped? By man's ideas, by man's interpretations. That man puts a creed in and a dogma and a a denomination and then you have all these different denominations that come forth. Why? Because God the people have changed God into what they want him to be. They want a religion that works best for them. &gt;&gt; And so people don't know really the God of the Bible. &gt;&gt; They don't know the things that God hates. Because if you if you preach the thing God hates and you begin to condemn the people and put it back in their lap and don't do these things, what happens? They'll find a church that only preaches that the things that God loves. &gt;&gt; I'm going to find me a church that preaches only love. But you see, we come to church to a fine things in our lives. And I say, "God, help us. &gt;&gt; Help us identify the things. God, if there's something in my life that you hate, if there's something that I'm doing, maybe and I don't even know and it's subconsciously or maybe it's a friend or I'm giving somebody a look, a proud look, &gt;&gt; a proud look, &gt;&gt; and you DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HAPPENING." But yet SOMETIMES IN OUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS ATTITUDES THAT GOD SAVED US AND HE redeemed us and you take a proud look of somebody sitting over there on the curb. &gt;&gt; Begin to judge that sinner. But if it wasn't for the grace of almighty God, &gt;&gt; that people know a God, but this God is is is through the lens of their religion. That the God that they created is based upon beliefs and things that they begin to agree on or disagree on or leave alone. Do we do we baptize or do we sprinkle? Do we have gifts or no gifts? Do we do these things or there's so many questions? It's so man-made. They they make this God that works for them. They be begin to use Bibles that they can understand as NIV and all whatever it may be. They begin to make it easier for the people. They begin to do customs and traditions and holidays and all these things that they can incorporate into their religion. today. I haven't heard any of you tell me merry Christmas. You say, "What are you talking about?" I didn't know it either till yesterday. I was at my shop and a mechanic and I went over there and a guy's, you know, they were talking back and forth and they're both Russian and he was like, "Are you going to church tonight?" The guy's like, "Yeah, I'm going to church." I said, "What do you guys believe?" "Oh, we're Russian Orthodox Christians." And I was like, "Okay." I said, "What's going on? What?" And he's like, "Well, Christmas is tomorrow." Because according to the Julian calendar, it's not the Gregorian calendar. It's 14 days behind or whatever it is, seven days. So today is Christmas. So if you want to celebrate Christmas not according to the traditions of other Christmases, you can celebrate this week. But do you understand that they are going based upon a calendar? that they stayed according to their religion, according to their god, according to the the way that they're so now they're in this world over here in America and they're ch, you know, they changed. Now the new year hasn't even happened because it's got to come after, right? So new year hasn't even happened. But people begin to understand a god based upon their religion. &gt;&gt; That if your god becomes your church and your god becomes the people and and madmade thinking, &gt;&gt; that's not the god I serve. But they were raised under that. &gt;&gt; And if you make your church or a man the absolute, then you only know God through those lens. &gt;&gt; If you make a church an absolute, well, they only do this and we're only going to do it and that's it. &gt;&gt; That's the absolute. Well, is that what God said? or we base in our opinions and our religions and different things that we do based upon an opinion or whatever it is. But I want to stick to the God of the Bible. &gt;&gt; And you see these ones and I have a heart for those people because many people, they're raised up under a religion. They're raised up under something THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA who God really is. that if they're raised up in a message home or OR A TAPED HOUSE AND I HAVE FAMILY THAT IS RAISED UP UNDER THAT and you talk TO THE KIDS AND THAT'S WHAT they believe because that's all that they know. That's all that they've been ingrained in them that this is what we're going to do and this is how we're going TO DO IT. SO, HOW CAN I CRITICIZE the kids if they're raised up under that way? That's right. &gt;&gt; But my heart goes OUT TO HIM BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT WHERE YOU CAN REACH OUT A hand and you just ask the question. When you begin to ask questions, &gt;&gt; you will get true answers from children or from kids. Because let me say this tonight. We are blessed that we I was born and raised in a message home with a solid pastor in a good church. That I was blessed to be brought up under that atmosphere. But yet many times young people can hide under that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; They're not exposed yet because they've never been asked, "Well, what do you believe? &gt;&gt; What does this prophet mean to you? Do you believe in pressing play or do you believe in listening to tapes at home? Do you do these things? But as message people, we can hide so much more because if they're out there in a doctrine or or seven thunders or whatever the doctrine is. Well, oh, we can identify that's they're over there. &gt;&gt; But let me ask you, sitting in a message church, do you know who God is? God is in his word. He says, "Brother, it's not eternal life to know your church. It's not eternal life to know the Somebody help me out. &gt;&gt; Catechism. It's not eternal life to know all your church's teachings. It's not eternal life to know or it's Yeah. It's not eternal life to know the Bible. To know him &gt;&gt; to know him &gt;&gt; is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can know him is being born again of his spirit. &gt;&gt; To know him is eternal life. Because you can memorize the scriptures, you can quote the quotes, and you can do all these things, but if you don't know Jesus Christ himself, &gt;&gt; it does you no good. That's not eternal life. If you can do all those things, but you got to know him. &gt;&gt; That the depth of people that knowing God is the savior is the depth that they'll ever know. that John 3:16 that God sent a savior to the world and that's the only God that they'll know because people only identify God in a time of need. And I've said it before that God they only identify a God in the time of need. That if something happens then they'll say, "Oh, there is a God or God saved me from this." BUT LET ME ASK YOU, DOES GOD HEAL people out there? &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Does he does he UH FROM A TRAGIC ACCIDENT? Does he uh uh heal people from a tragic accident? &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. But do they know him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But yet that's who God is. &gt;&gt; Is because he says, "I would that no man perish." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being God? So it's not our responsibility to have that kind of understanding of who God is. that if it's a shallow base that I only know him as a savior that if he's good to me or I serve a god in denominational churches are full but they don't really know the God of the Bible in the depth in which you know but it's not their responsibility to know but unto you who are called unto you who are chosen unto you who God seen fit to elect and reveal and give you revelation and understanding of who he is now responsibility is on you &gt;&gt; to know who he is. &gt;&gt; Let me get to this. It is up for us, up to us to know him deeper in a more personal way. And it came to me there today that the God your kids know is the God who you teach and show him who he is. The God your kids know because on the age of accountability, they're going to be watching how you are. How do you serve your wife? How do you love your brother? How do you how do you serve God back to him? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do they run into the room and they find you on your knees or reading your Bible? &gt;&gt; Right? Do they see daddy and mommy have devotional time or or even you know dad coming in and and see him reading his Bible because they only know the God that you &gt;&gt; because my son Nolan four years old he's not going to know God in the direction he isn't going to know his personal savior he does that that'll be later down the road Right. &gt;&gt; BUT WE WANT TO SHOW them stepping stones. &gt;&gt; Son, you say your good night prayer. &gt;&gt; You tell God what you're thankful for. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm thankful for my toys. I'm thankful for the good food that they brought us today. &gt;&gt; But yet, that's the God he knows. He's he's giving back. He's he's returning something in the in the simplicity &gt;&gt; of loving God. What are you teaching them? What are you showing them? Those little things that you won't even know that comes to a kid's mind &gt;&gt; whenever he begins to pray that he even brag on him a little bit. He sees sister Linda fall in the pastor appreciation and for weeks guess who was in his prayer &gt;&gt; and bless sister Linda and for weeks and finally I had to say son guess what the Lord's healed her he did yeah goes and see he does she doesn't have a cast no more but yet these kids are picking up things. What is it you're teaching them and you're showing them? This is who God is. He's not some object of we got to come and and say your prayer. Son, get down and pray. &gt;&gt; No, that's not how you teach your kid. Why don't you get down and pray with them? &gt;&gt; Why don't you show them how &gt;&gt; don't you show them how to do a devotion? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's teaching God to your kids. &gt;&gt; Yes. Very good. &gt;&gt; And that's the God that they will know. The God they know is the God you show him. On a scriptural example, you can see that Abraham whenever he took Isaac up into the mountain, he said, "I and the lad will return." He had faith that he would return. He knew the Lord would provide. He knew he was Jehovah Gyra. He didn't know how. He didn't know when, but it was a profession and it was a confession out loud that I and the lad will return. But let me ask you, as a boy, a little Isaac going up the mountain, do you think he knew Jehovah Gyra? Do you think he knew God is Jehovah Gyra? The Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. He had probably had no idea. &gt;&gt; But he's going up THE MOUNTAIN AND HE'S WALKING UP. DADDY, WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHERE ARE we going, son? We got to go and we got to offer a sacrifice. But the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice. And he's telling Isaac as he's walking up, the Lord's going to provide. Daddy, I don't see anything around here, but he's going to provide. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Isaac didn't have a revelation. He God never revealed unto him yet Jehovah Gyra. The attribute of Jehovah Gyra. But yet there was coming a time THAT YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT WHENEVER Abraham laying upon the sacrifice or upon THE ALTAR READY TO BE SACRIFICED AND HIS HANDS were tied and HE WAS SAYING, "DADDY, BUT YOU SAID and he's laying there bound &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden a bleeding of a a ram over in the thicket." Let me tell you, did Isaac know then who Jehovah Gyra was? You bet he did. He knew exactly who Jehovah Gyra was. &gt;&gt; That Abraham didn't say, "Hey, this is God and this is this is an attribute that he wants to express unto you." But yet Isaac knew personally this is Jehovah Gyra. He says in Jehovah, he says God has seven compound redemptive names. Those redemptive names are inseparable. You can't separate one from the other. You can't separate one from the other. You can't have this one without this one. Give me the the seven redemptive names. So, we see these seven redemptive names, if we have them. the seven redemptive names that God in his great mercy and all of his goodness and everything that he bestowed upon us in order to reveal himself that he would come in such ways that he would have redemptive names that he would begin to express himself to his people. That there's times in our lives that we become more attached to a redemptive NAME THAT WE DRAW CLOSE and we draw virtue &gt;&gt; out of those redemptive names. BE BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW WHO GOD IS &gt;&gt; THAT YOU JUST DON'T PRAY LET ME TELL YOU MAKE GOD PERSONAL TO you that it's just not God I asked you for this and I asked you to this no WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW WHO HE IS and you have a need and you need a HEALING IN YOUR BODY YOU SAY GOD I NEED I NEED JEHOVAH RAFA I NEED HIM TO COME and I need to be my portion &gt;&gt; do you understand how personal that is Yeah. &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN SOMEBODY ADDRESSES YOU PERSONALLY THAT IT'S just not God, help me do this, that, that's not real personal, but when you say, "God, I have a need in my life. That I need you to be Jehovah Gyra. That I need you to come down and need you to provide. I have a situation in my life. Jehovah Shalom in the time of peace. How many times do we get worked up in life and cares of life &gt;&gt; and we just need the peace of God &gt;&gt; to come and to comfort us &gt;&gt; and to tell a son it's going to be okay. Daughter it's going to be okay. I know the world is falling apart and I know that this burden is upon your life and maybe it's a sickness and it's something that you're going under or news from the doctor and you don't know what tomorrow holds but you just need the peace of God to come. We have to draw from those redemptive names. He says, "Now Jehovah appeared in the Old Testament in the seven compound redemptive names and those names of Jehovah. Jehovah's attitude towards his people. Each one of those expresses what Jehovah is to his people. Whatever he is to his people, he appears in those res redemptive compound names. whatever he is to his people that there's times in our lives that we go through hard times. Saints, if we you're going through a sickness that is unbearable and you need God, maybe it's a death sentence, maybe it's something and there's no way out. God is going to draw closer unto you and these redemptive names of healer and comforter. &gt;&gt; Yes. But you have to draw from them. You have to pull that out of him. You have to know exactly. He's wanting to give you more than you want. &gt;&gt; He's such a personal God. musicians come that when you know him, you know how to serve him. And when you know how to serve him, you know how to love him. And when you love him, there's something about it You know, God is depending upon you and he's relying on you to draw from that fountain, to draw from him, to draw those things out. And Paul says that I want to know Christ in the power of his resurrection. That I want to know him like Job. I want to know him. That I want to know that my redeemer liveth. That though these skin worms, Lord, though you take everything, saints, have you crossed that line? Family, materialistic things. And yet Job could say, "I know. I know my redeemer liveth. I yought my redeemer. Why? Because I know him personally. The same God that appeared to Abraham as Jehovah Gyra. You can find it all the way down through scripture. But that same God, Jehovah Gyra, is still here tonight. Jehovah Rafa saints. That's the God I serve. That's the God I know. And when you know him in the power of his resurrection, it don't matter what comes our way. It don't matter what the future holds. You know who holds it. And you know, our lives are in the palm of his hand. &gt;&gt; And we could rest assured in those promises &gt;&gt; that the same God that met Moses on the back side of the desert in the form of a pillar of fire, that pillar of fire is still here tonight. He took a picture with our prophet to say, "This is the vindicated man. This is him. This is the voice. Listen to what he has to say." And I'm so thankful, saints. We can't know him enough. We can't search his word enough. We can't listen enough &gt;&gt; to identify because when you know who he is, you know who you are. &gt;&gt; When you know who he is, saints, and you know the power that is within you. I was listening the other day. He says we God has enough power but we just need the authority when to use that power. &gt;&gt; God has all the power. We just need the authority that authority to come when to say and when to speak. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together. Jehovah Gyra. over child my you are done for for your healer this evening. You're my healer and by your stripes I am set free. Hold your hope. You are way of thinking. You love all my You are all so much more than you are Amen. If you have a need, he's Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He knows the end from the beginning. He knows our desires. Maybe you have a need and you want to make it known with an uplifted hand. And you say, "God, I have a need in my life. Father, you are Jehovah Gyra. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord, you never fail upon your word. Father, hands all over the building signifying they have a need. They have something in their life. But Lord, you can go to every single heart. You can walk the aisles. You can go to the very chair. You can discern the heart, Lord. You know the tears that are cried at night. You know the the wanderings or whatever it is, oh God, behind that uplifted hand. And I pray would you be their portion this evening, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're so personal to us. You're so real. that we can't ever thank you enough for your goodness in our lives, oh God. And we pray this evening, Father, that you would meet the needs that this word has gone forth and your people have come. We ask that you would encourage and that you would uplift, that you would be their portion, that they go from this place and they said, "It was good that I I came and I received of the Lord, that I heard from you, that I know who my God is. I know the God that I serve. The same God that done all these mighty works in the days of old that he he performed the wonders and Elijah called down fire from heaven. And he says, "If Baal be God, you serve him. But if OUR GOD ANSWERS BY FIRE, LET HIM be God." &gt;&gt; And Lord, you're there to meet every challenge. And I say this evening, let our God be God, &gt;&gt; for he answers by fire. &gt;&gt; And you prove your word time and time again. &gt;&gt; Be with your people this evening. Go with them. Strengthen them. Strengthen our pastor, oh God. The needs of your body.

We love you and thank you &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead. Jehovah, you're my victory. You are for me. I see you.
