[56:27] I want to welcome my brother Jeremiah.
[56:32] Praise the name of our Lord.
[56:36] We appreciate him as a pastor.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[56:42] Last Sunday, pastor was visiting his
[56:44] church.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And we appreciate that. Praise the name
[56:51] of our Lord.
[56:53] I remember I don't I but more than 10
[56:56] years I believe more than 10 or 15 years
[56:59] plus.
[57:01] I remember I called him on phone.
[57:04] I think it was some evening.
[57:06] Then I called him that please you're
[57:08] going to start translating for us.
[57:12] That time it was brother Julius Kato was
[57:15] doing the translation
[57:18] and then brother Jeremiah started here
[57:21] of course with his staggering
[57:24] but by the time he finished he's an
[57:26] expert.
[57:31] There are even some words he speaks
[57:33] which you find out what is the meaning
[57:35] at least maybe not the English one
[57:40] and then when brother Jeremiah was like
[57:44] almost exiting
[57:48] then now we identified brother Cyrus
[57:52] Cyus
[57:54] praise the name of our lord then now
[57:56] he's also trying to pick up
[57:59] then I told Cyus
[58:02] that our experience here at church.
[58:06] So comes to stand here
[58:09] either in song leading
[58:11] or in translating
[58:13] or in preaching at the end of the day
[58:16] they become pastors.
[58:19] So I told him
[58:21] praise the name of our lord. Watch
[58:26] even in your marriage be careful what
[58:28] you choose.
[58:31] Praise the name of our Lord. And it's
[58:33] just the same message actually.
[58:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So we happy
[58:38] to be here today.
[58:40] We happy to have the different pastors
[58:42] around who have come from different
[58:43] places.
[58:46] And even the members of churches from
[58:49] different places
[58:51] want thank you so much for coming.
[58:54] Praise the name of our Lord. I know
[58:56] there are others who are still on the
[58:57] way coming.
[58:59] But I'm requesting the pastors over
[59:02] there to come and sit and occupy these
[59:03] front seats
[59:07] that we may give more warmth to the
[59:08] minister.
[59:11] If you are a pastor, you come back.
[59:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[59:17] occupy these front seats. those who come
[59:20] later will
[59:24] praise the name of.
[59:29] So, Pastor is not around today.
[59:33] Brother Ruben lost his sister.
[59:38] So, they went for bario
[59:41] and they are still in Kenya.
[59:44] So we just keep them in our prayers
[59:47] and we keep also that family in our
[59:49] prayers.
[59:51] Praise the name of our Lord.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; So today we are going to have two
[59:54] services.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; The afternoon service
[59:59] I requested pastor George
[1:00:03] you know to the moment he finishes
[1:00:05] preaching in the afternoon
[1:00:08] we shall have a prayer line.
[1:00:11] Praise the name of our Lord. And I
[1:00:13] believe it will be a blessing to all of
[1:00:15] us.
[1:00:17] You know when it comes for prayer.
[1:00:20] Whatever need you have before the Lord
[1:00:22] just say Lord I'm depending upon you to
[1:00:25] answer my need.

[1:01:04] because most of the youth who are in
[1:01:05] school now they're in holidays.
[1:01:10] So we need to have further interaction

[1:15:15] that there is nothing our hand will

[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; I I want to thank the pastor this
[1:19:11] morning.
[1:19:14] This opportunity to minister in this
[1:19:16] pulpit.
[1:19:20] There is something about a pastor and a
[1:19:22] church on Sunday morning.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; There is something about a pastor at the
[1:19:27] church on Sunday morning.
[1:19:29] pastor and the church.
[1:19:34] The church want to hear their pastor.
[1:19:38] It's a normal thing especially on Sunday
[1:19:39] morning.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; You know pastors many times can give
[1:19:45] away during the week
[1:19:50] but there's something traditional that
[1:19:52] the pastor want to speak to the church
[1:19:54] Sunday morning.
[1:20:02] And that's why for pastor to give away
[1:20:04] church service on Sunday to somebody
[1:20:06] else
[1:20:09] is a great sacrifice.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah. Great sacrifice
[1:20:15] time pastor James this morning
[1:20:19] you are given to me to speak to God's
[1:20:22] heritage.
[1:20:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are going to
[1:20:27] take it lightly.
[1:20:29] We are not going to take it light.
[1:20:32] We really appreciate it and I
[1:20:34] appreciated it.
[1:20:37] Blessed be God. I've been with Pastor
[1:20:40] James since I came.
[1:20:43] We have a wonderful time fellowship.
[1:20:46] He's a man that have a nice spirit.
[1:20:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; You know spirit recognize spirits.
[1:20:55] Spirit recognize spirit.
[1:21:00] You understanding? Spirit recognize
[1:21:02] spirit.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And I find it with a man with a nice
[1:21:07] spirit.
[1:21:09] And I appreciate God for that.
[1:21:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:15] And I want to also thank pastoral.
[1:21:19] Uh when I was having the intention to
[1:21:21] come to Uganda again,
[1:21:25] Because the last time I came to Uganda
[1:21:27] almost 10 years ago, December will make
[1:21:28] it 10 years.
[1:21:35] So when we came, we have a wonderful
[1:21:37] time.
[1:21:39] And when I was leaving told me George,
[1:21:44] anytime you feel like coming to Uganda,
[1:21:45] just let me know.
[1:21:49] So we've been communicating many times.
[1:21:52] I look at his sermon sometime on
[1:21:54] Facebook YouTube.
[1:21:57] I listen to them. I enjoy them.
[1:22:00] So this time that it was not upon my
[1:22:02] heart to come,
[1:22:05] I just called him. I said, "Pastor,
[1:22:08] it's just wrinkling me to come
[1:22:11] cuz it's very difficult for me to travel
[1:22:13] most times these days
[1:22:16] because I also pastor. I'm also a
[1:22:18] pastor."
[1:22:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. One of my son is
[1:22:22] standing my church this morning to
[1:22:24] minister to the people.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; So three places were in my heart.
[1:22:35] There are three places I will have my
[1:22:37] heart to travel to.
[1:22:42] One of the place was a place in Nigeria.
[1:22:46] I've not been there before.
[1:22:49] So I just called the pastor.
[1:22:52] I say it's laid upon my heart
[1:22:55] to come to greet your people.
[1:22:58] Then he said that's all right. Say come
[1:23:01] say I should come.
[1:23:04] Then the second place was Uganda here
[1:23:09] and I also come as a ballet. I said I
[1:23:11] would like to come
[1:23:14] and the third place was Canada.
[1:23:18] So by the grace of God I have covered
[1:23:20] Nigeria part
[1:23:23] and I'm here in Uganda now
[1:23:26] and the other one is in Canada.
[1:23:29] I have also called them over there.
[1:23:31] So they are making preparation for me to
[1:23:33] come.
[1:23:34] So when I was in in the place I went to
[1:23:37] Nigeria
[1:23:39] there was a wonderful thing that
[1:23:40] happened.
[1:23:42] I have never had that experience in my
[1:23:43] life before.
[1:23:46] But it was wonderful.
[1:23:48] Hallelujah.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was wonderful. A
[1:23:51] wonderful experience.
[1:23:53] So this time now I'm in Uganda.
[1:23:56] I believe we are going to have a
[1:23:58] wonderful time.
[1:24:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be God.
[1:24:03] So I traveled to some few places.
[1:24:07] I came I was in Cami.
[1:24:12] I saw some
[1:24:14] suspiri's
[1:24:24] place
[1:24:27] and I was with pastor Kabasi also
[1:24:33] and I was in pastor Wilson place also
[1:24:38] we saw s
[1:24:41] Did I get Oh, pastor, you are there. God
[1:24:43] bless you. Pastor San I was also there.
[1:24:49] Uh we we we met before when I came
[1:24:52] when I saw the face I I recognized but
[1:24:55] didn't really collect
[1:24:58] but he was able to get the face also.
[1:25:01] So I think we have a wonderful time. So
[1:25:04] we are here this morning by the grace of
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:07] and I know God is going to bless us.
[1:25:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Because I believe all my heart
[1:25:15] anytime we come in God's presence,
[1:25:19] he always have something to give to us
[1:25:23] because our God is inexhaustible
[1:25:26] fountain.
[1:25:29] He want to bless you. He's mindful of
[1:25:32] you.
[1:25:34] Therefore, when we come to the house of
[1:25:35] God like this,
[1:25:37] I always tell us, let us give undivided
[1:25:40] attention.
[1:25:43] Let us not be divided.
[1:25:46] Let us not be distracted.
[1:25:49] Don't be walking up and down.
[1:25:52] It could be a day of your visitation.
[1:25:55] Concentrate because we in his presence
[1:25:59] and in God's presence
[1:26:01] demand reverence.
[1:26:04] reverence
[1:26:06] and that's why as his presence is here
[1:26:08] this morning
[1:26:10] when you recognize the presence of God
[1:26:14] he will release to you your heart
[1:26:20] and you can't be recognizing God
[1:26:22] presence
[1:26:24] by being irreverent
[1:26:28] way to show that you recognize God's
[1:26:30] presence
[1:26:31] you will be reverence.
[1:26:34] And when God seeing you that you are
[1:26:37] reverence
[1:26:39] for his presence, you can never go back
[1:26:42] the same,
[1:26:44] he release a blessing to you. And I
[1:26:47] believe this morning, God release a
[1:26:49] blessing to you.
[1:26:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are God's
[1:26:54] children. And we are privileged in times
[1:26:58] like this for God to reveal to us our
[1:27:02] position in him
[1:27:04] is a privilege because we are living in
[1:27:07] time of confusion.
[1:27:09] The world is confused. The people are
[1:27:11] confused. It's a prophecy that in the
[1:27:15] end times
[1:27:17] are to be failing for fear.
[1:27:21] But he has told you and me
[1:27:24] not
[1:27:26] for my presence is with you
[1:27:29] to bless you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Blessed be God.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; So, Pastor James, thank you very much
[1:27:37] again.
[1:27:40] God bless you. So, he was telling me has
[1:27:42] told me before that we are going to have
[1:27:44] a prayer line.
[1:27:49] The other time I was here,
[1:27:51] I minister in this pulpit.
[1:27:54] When I finished preaching,
[1:27:58] the moment I finished preaching,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I called the pastor.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I hand over to him. I ran away.
[1:28:05] I ran to the office.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; I remember.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; So when I ran to the office,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; he came to meet me in the office.
[1:28:17] People are in the
[1:28:21] go and pray for them.
[1:28:23] [Laughter]
[1:28:28] Pastor Steve, he came to he came to he
[1:28:31] said come.
[1:28:33] He said you are finished preaching. He
[1:28:35] said they at the altar
[1:28:37] come.
[1:28:41] Then I came.
[1:28:43] Then I started praying for them one
[1:28:45] after the other.
[1:28:48] When I finished praying for the people,
[1:28:50] I was very tired.
[1:28:54] I think it was because of that
[1:28:56] tiredness, I ran away to the hospital.
[1:29:00] I was trying to help myself.
[1:29:03] The pastor went to go and bring me back.
[1:29:06] So when I finished praying, I become
[1:29:09] more tired
[1:29:12] and I was to travel to back to Kala.
[1:29:17] to be with a a church there.
[1:29:22] So there was a brother here.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I remember
[1:29:27] that and I I I lay hand upon him. I
[1:29:31] prayed for him.
[1:29:33] So when I was taken back to campala
[1:29:39] then they they they directed me to the
[1:29:41] hotel
[1:29:43] where I was to stay. Then
[1:29:46] when I was packing my things,
[1:29:49] I saw the was following me.
[1:29:54] He was packing the things.
[1:29:57] Then after we enter, I enter my guest
[1:29:59] room.
[1:30:01] I said, "Brother, thank you. I
[1:30:03] appreciate you." He said, he said,
[1:30:05] "Thank you, sir.
[1:30:07] I I appreciate you more."
[1:30:10] I said, "More."
[1:30:14] He said, "I follow you down
[1:30:18] from ginger.
[1:30:21] I was in the church
[1:30:24] when you were ministering.
[1:30:27] I was among the people that you lay hand
[1:30:29] upon.
[1:30:31] This is the Bible before me. I'm giving
[1:30:33] his testimony."
[1:30:36] He said I was having some medical
[1:30:38] conditions
[1:30:40] that I've been battling.
[1:30:42] He said to even make you sure I am a
[1:30:44] medical practitioner
[1:30:48] is my line
[1:30:51] and the bounties have no use
[1:30:56] when you lay hand on me
[1:31:00] that let me
[1:31:04] follow you.
[1:31:06] to this place.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I want to see attend the meetings. I
[1:31:10] want to see
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I want to see attend your meetings.
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:16] I said I said brother congratulation.
[1:31:19] We thank God for that.
[1:31:24] I don't know is the brother here this
[1:31:25] morning.
[1:31:27] He told me he was not a member of this
[1:31:29] boat. He was in that meetings.
[1:31:34] the condition left him
[1:31:37] since it's that time.
[1:31:40] He has not experienced it.
[1:31:44] Our God is here to heal.
[1:31:49] Our God is here to deliver.
[1:31:52] Our God is here to bless.
[1:31:56] Our God is here to lift up.
[1:31:59] And I believe this morning today is
[1:32:02] somebody's day of visitation.
[1:32:06] Because that's the purpose of the word
[1:32:10] is to give you something
[1:32:13] I believe this morning. God will give us
[1:32:15] something.
[1:32:17] So again I bring greetings from Nigeria
[1:32:20] from my family
[1:32:22] from the church. Glory be to God.
[1:32:26] Hallelujah.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this morning by the grace
[1:32:30] of God I want to read from the book of
[1:32:33] Ephesians.
[1:32:37] Ephesians chapter 3.
[1:32:52] Ephesians chapter 3
[1:32:54] verse 14.
[1:32:58] to 20.
[1:33:02] Father, we are told the pace of this
[1:33:03] Bible, but it takes you to give the
[1:33:06] understanding. We are depending upon you
[1:33:08] for understanding.
[1:33:10] We depend upon you for revelation. Lord,
[1:33:13] may you grant it to us and give us a
[1:33:16] blessing in Jesus Christ.
[1:33:21] Ephesians
[1:33:23] 3:14 to 20.
[1:33:26] For this cause I bow my kneel unto the
[1:33:30] father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:33:41] earth is named.
[1:33:48] that he will grant you according to the
[1:33:51] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:33:54] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:33:57] man.
[1:34:08] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[1:34:11] ye be rooted and grounded in love.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; May be able to comprehend with all
[1:34:25] saints what is the breadth and length
[1:34:28] and depth and height.
[1:34:45] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:34:47] passeth knowledge and that you might be
[1:34:49] filled with all the fullness of God.
[1:35:01] Now unto him that is able to do
[1:35:03] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:35:05] ask
[1:35:07] or think according to the power that
[1:35:09] workketh in us.
[1:35:23] May the Lord bless his word in Jesus
[1:35:24] Christ's name
[1:35:28] as we have our seat
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; this morning by the grace of God
[1:35:36] from that place we read in Ephesians
[1:35:38] chapter 3 verse 14 down to 20
[1:35:44] I want to take a test from the last
[1:35:46] verse
[1:35:50] and t to it the power that walketh in
[1:35:54] us.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The power that walketh in us.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; This morning by the grace of God,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use Jacob to be a case
[1:36:19] reference.
[1:36:25] Because
[1:36:28] in the book of second Peter chapter 2
[1:36:35] verse 11
[1:36:40] he was telling us about
[1:36:43] angels
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; which are greater in power and mind.
[1:36:52] Angels are greater in power and in
[1:36:55] might.
[1:36:59] So that verse is telling us about the
[1:37:02] power of angels.
[1:37:06] Angels have power
[1:37:10] because this want to talk about power.
[1:37:14] The power that workketh in us.
[1:37:18] So because we want to talk about power,
[1:37:22] I want to go I want to go to before the
[1:37:23] beginning
[1:37:27] when there was no God
[1:37:31] when the attribute god was not yet
[1:37:33] manifested.
[1:37:37] So we want to talk about the great
[1:37:38] antenna
[1:37:42] Elohim. Elohim, the selfexisting one
[1:37:46] before he was God,
[1:37:49] there's an attribute he have in him
[1:37:52] as the eternal spirit
[1:37:55] that he want to manifest.
[1:38:00] The creator of heaven and earth,
[1:38:05] the great internal spirit
[1:38:09] that filled the all
[1:38:13] There was nothing like heaven.
[1:38:15] There was nothing like earth
[1:38:18] because heaven was his attribute.
[1:38:21] X was his attribute. You and me were his
[1:38:25] attribute. So everything was just an
[1:38:28] attribute in him
[1:38:30] and he was existing alone with his
[1:38:32] attribute.
[1:38:34] He was not yet God.
[1:38:42] Do you should
[1:38:45] give me who is this paragraph 57 55
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; who is this mech paragraph 55 it was not
[1:38:53] yet evil God.
[1:38:56] It was not yet evil anything
[1:38:59] but just the spirit entire spirit and it
[1:39:03] filled the entire place
[1:39:06] and we were attribute in him
[1:39:09] existing within
[1:39:11] alone
[1:39:13] but there are things he wants to
[1:39:15] manifest.
[1:39:17] Redemption was his manifestation.
[1:39:21] He was a redeemer but as being a
[1:39:24] redeemer
[1:39:26] The de was an attribute in him.
[1:39:30] Hallelujah.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he wants to be
[1:39:33] manifesting this attribute.
[1:39:38] But before that start the first thing he
[1:39:41] did,
[1:39:43] he made a body.
[1:39:46] He made a body
[1:39:48] because he's the maker of all things
[1:39:52] both in heaven and on earth. So the
[1:39:55] first thing that he did
[1:39:58] he made a body
[1:40:00] and when he made a body the entire
[1:40:03] spirit
[1:40:05] he now can into the body
[1:40:10] he can know
[1:40:12] he poured himself into that body
[1:40:15] and that body is what we call the word
[1:40:19] that is why John chapter one said
[1:40:22] in the beginning was the
[1:40:25] The word have a beginning.
[1:40:28] The internal does not have a beginning.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Get it right.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; The internal spirit
[1:40:38] does not have a beginning but the word
[1:40:40] have a beginning.
[1:40:43] What we call the word is a body that the
[1:40:47] entire spirit pou
[1:40:52] then he said in the beginning
[1:40:55] was the word
[1:40:57] have you
[1:41:02] are you there
[1:41:06] so
[1:41:08] that was the stage he was
[1:41:10] when he started creating
[1:41:14] And the first thing he created
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; they were angels.
[1:41:20] So when that made angel
[1:41:23] angels responsibility
[1:41:26] their funure
[1:41:28] their function their operations
[1:41:31] their work was to worship.
[1:41:37] And when started worshiping
[1:41:40] the attribute of God was now manifested,
[1:41:44] he become God.
[1:41:48] That's what we become God.
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It become God
[1:41:58] because angel were there to worship.
[1:42:02] Among all these angels
[1:42:05] there were categories
[1:42:07] because God is a god of variety.
[1:42:11] Is a god of variety on earth.
[1:42:14] Is a god of variety in heaven.
[1:42:18] In heaven there are categories of
[1:42:20] angels.
[1:42:22] We have the
[1:42:25] we have the
[1:42:27] major angels. We have no categories of
[1:42:30] angels.
[1:42:32] He made them
[1:42:34] stay in their position
[1:42:37] worship and among all the angels that
[1:42:40] God created.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; was the second command.
[1:42:48] It was the second command
[1:42:52] because even God himself
[1:42:54] in the heavenly creation
[1:42:56] in the heavenly creation is an angel.
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:06] Christ.
[1:43:09] Hebrew chapter one told us that
[1:43:13] angel his fellows
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:17] say thy scepter is the scepter of
[1:43:20] righteousness.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Thy scepter is the scepter of
[1:43:24] righteousness.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you call scepter here.
[1:43:27] Scepter
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; scepter
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; something of a king. So the king holds
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:35] thy s is the scepter of righteousness.
[1:43:39] Thou hated iniquity
[1:43:44] and love righteousness
[1:43:48] that that was that was anointed with oil
[1:43:51] of gladness.
[1:43:53] That was anointed with oil of gladness.
[1:44:01] Okay.
[1:44:05] The gladness above thy fellows. So he
[1:44:08] was a fellow to the angels.
[1:44:12] It was Michael
[1:44:14] in angelic form.
[1:44:17] Micah and Lucifer they were coequal
[1:44:22] in everything
[1:44:24] except in creation.
[1:44:29] They were coequal in everything except
[1:44:33] in creation
[1:44:36] was the one that created Lucifer and he
[1:44:38] created all things.
[1:44:44] Among all the angel he came
[1:44:48] Lucifer Lucifer
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; was the only angel
[1:44:51] that have a throne.
[1:44:54] He have a throne.
[1:44:57] Mikey have a throne. Lucifer have a
[1:44:59] truth.
[1:45:02] And Lucifer was created
[1:45:05] to be the one to leave the worship.
[1:45:09] He was the anointed cher
[1:45:12] and leave the worship.
[1:45:14] He was to worship.
[1:45:17] He was to lead the other angel to
[1:45:19] worship.
[1:45:22] That was his work.
[1:45:23] He was the most beautiful among all the
[1:45:25] angels.
[1:45:27] He was the song leader.
[1:45:31] All instrument of music were in him.
[1:45:35] He was made like that.
[1:45:39] He was the most beautiful among God the
[1:45:41] angels
[1:45:43] and he was made like that.
[1:45:46] The book of Ezekiel chapter 28
[1:45:50] tells us that.
[1:45:53] He was anointed.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; So when he called for worship,
[1:45:58] it was a wonderful worship because he
[1:46:00] was an anointed worship.
[1:46:03] When it's time to worship, the entire
[1:46:06] heaven will be shaken
[1:46:08] and he was doing it wonderfully
[1:46:14] until
[1:46:16] the beauty
[1:46:19] all the
[1:46:23] come over his head.
[1:46:26] He got lifted up
[1:46:28] with pride
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and he now wants also to be worshiped.
[1:46:37] These things I want to not touch every
[1:46:40] one point.
[1:46:43] Whatever God has given to you,
[1:46:47] God don't want the to.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever God has given to you,
[1:47:03] don't let it come over your head. Don't
[1:47:05] let it.
[1:47:07] Humble yourself.
[1:47:09] God is looking for people that he will
[1:47:13] give something to
[1:47:15] a human being that God will give
[1:47:17] something to and he want to see remain a
[1:47:20] woman being.
[1:47:23] The more you humble yourself, the more
[1:47:26] God will bless you
[1:47:28] because God love humility.
[1:47:32] God he live,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; walk and dwell in humility.
[1:47:39] That is why when you see people and they
[1:47:43] say they have seen God evidence to know
[1:47:45] that a man has seen God
[1:47:50] when you see men who carry their chest
[1:47:53] up
[1:47:54] seen God
[1:48:00] anything you have anything I have give
[1:48:04] it to us because the Bible say there is
[1:48:07] Nothing the man can receive
[1:48:10] except God give it from him.
[1:48:13] So when God give you something, humble
[1:48:16] yourself with it.
[1:48:18] He will give you the more.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what God wants
[1:48:26] because that is God's nature.
[1:48:28] God's nature is humility.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[1:48:37] So because of the way Lucifer was made,
[1:48:42] pride came over him.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Then he said,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; I will also exalt my throne.
[1:48:52] Isaiah 12 verse 14:2.
[1:48:56] I will now exalt my throne
[1:48:59] above the stars of God.
[1:49:02] I want to be worshiped also.
[1:49:06] It was because of the way what was given
[1:49:08] to him.
[1:49:11] This thing were written for our
[1:49:12] learning.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; For our learning
[1:49:19] so
[1:49:21] get this clear. Whatever you receive,
[1:49:26] it is from God.
[1:49:28] And God want you to humble yourself
[1:49:32] because there's no limit
[1:49:35] blessing
[1:49:37] you can humble yourself.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? He get lifted up.
[1:49:46] He wants to be worshiped.
[1:49:48] Then he went because of his intentions,
[1:49:54] his desire.
[1:49:55] He went to the angels. Then he preached
[1:49:58] to them.
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; He preached to them. I see the way this
[1:50:04] is now.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I think we can better kingdom. I give
[1:50:09] better position
[1:50:11] responsibility.
[1:50:12] I have better things.
[1:50:14] He succeeded.
[1:50:16] He will turn of
[1:50:23] he succeeded.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; He succeeded. to war to of the angels.
[1:50:32] He succeeded to war to third of the
[1:50:35] angel to himself.
[1:50:38] And the Bible says there was war in
[1:50:40] heaven
[1:50:43] because sin has started.
[1:50:46] Heaven has been divided
[1:50:49] and might ascend. It can't contain us.
[1:50:54] Either you come repent
[1:50:57] or you go down. So there was war
[1:51:01] because there's no repentance for
[1:51:02] angels.
[1:51:05] When they fall, they fall.
[1:51:10] No repentance for angels.
[1:51:13] When they fall, they fall. So there was
[1:51:16] war. It was not easy war.
[1:51:19] Now listen this one coming.
[1:51:22] Lucifer in heaven when he succeeded in
[1:51:26] war the ages
[1:51:29] because they were stars of heaven
[1:51:34] stars of God.
[1:51:36] There is a difference between stars of
[1:51:38] heaven.
[1:51:41] When we talking about the stars of
[1:51:42] heaven
[1:51:44] in revelation 12, those were the one
[1:51:47] that were worshiping.
[1:51:49] When we talking about the stars of God,
[1:51:52] we talking about the sons of God.
[1:51:55] So when there was a war in heaven,
[1:51:57] Lucifide
[1:52:07] and others remain with God.
[1:52:11] And that is why you and me I believe
[1:52:14] this morning we are sitting down here
[1:52:17] because we are stars of God
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:20] because it takes a star of God to
[1:52:23] receive the word of God.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; He's not shooting.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Are you shooting?
[1:52:35] I'm changing my mind.
[1:52:38] Are you with us?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Give me another one. I'm not there
[1:52:41] again. I'm not. Give me another one
[1:52:42] again. Unfailing reality. Unfailing
[1:52:45] reality.
[1:52:47] 22 224.
[1:52:50] Unfailing reality. 224. I'm not here
[1:52:51] again. I'm coming back.
[1:52:53] So what happened?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; He succeeded to divide the heaven. I
[1:52:58] want to show you something. This is why
[1:53:01] today as you are here sitting down in
[1:53:05] the presence of God to hear the voice of
[1:53:08] God in this last day,
[1:53:11] there are also people in church they are
[1:53:14] hearing the voice of the God of this
[1:53:15] evil age.
[1:53:17] So as the heaven was divided even the
[1:53:20] earth is also divided.
[1:53:24] There are people today with this same
[1:53:27] Bible,
[1:53:29] they in church and they in millions and
[1:53:32] in billions
[1:53:34] because from the beginning they f with
[1:53:37] Lucifer
[1:53:38] they are also in churches this morning
[1:53:42] believing God of this evil age.
[1:53:47] You and me you are sitting down here
[1:53:49] believe in the almighty God because we
[1:53:51] are in him.
[1:53:55] This is it.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; 224. Yes. 22 to4 24 2.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something that these
[1:54:06] things are not coincident.
[1:54:16] So as the angel fell,
[1:54:20] there were some angel that stayed with
[1:54:21] Mike.
[1:54:24] As some people fail,
[1:54:26] there are people that stay with Mike
[1:54:29] and the grace of God. We are the one
[1:54:31] that stay with Michael.
[1:54:33] That is why when Mike came down and
[1:54:37] become Jesus Christ,
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; this system is really not giving more
[1:54:47] than once.
[1:54:49] If he cannot go, let's go on our own.
[1:54:52] I want to give I want to show you the
[1:54:53] informations.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; What am I saying?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; So there was war in heaven. Heaven was
[1:55:00] divided.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Then he and his cohort, Lucifer and his
[1:55:06] cast down.
[1:55:09] When Lucifer and his cohort were cast
[1:55:12] down,
[1:55:15] they lost their estate.
[1:55:19] They lost their habitation.
[1:55:22] Because their estate
[1:55:25] was to be angels.
[1:55:28] Their habitation
[1:55:30] were heaven was heaven. So when they
[1:55:33] were cast down, they lost their
[1:55:35] habitation
[1:55:37] their
[1:55:40] become Satan.
[1:55:43] He was no longer Lucifer.
[1:55:46] He become Satan. And the angel that fell
[1:55:49] with him become demon.
[1:55:53] But get something clear. Get something
[1:55:55] clear. Even when they were cast down,
[1:55:59] they still having their power.
[1:56:05] Let me say one more thing.
[1:56:08] Greed
[1:56:10] does not satisfy a hungry heart.
[1:56:16] who satisfied.
[1:56:18] If a man is hungry for God,
[1:56:21] you can tell him.
[1:56:24] Say the creed. Apostle
[1:56:28] say the apostle cre
[1:56:31] join the church. Put your name on here.
[1:56:34] The spring
[1:56:37] or whatever you
[1:56:39] or whatever you want
[1:56:41] that will not satisfy a hungry soul.
[1:56:48] Because they were predestinated to of
[1:56:52] God to search.
[1:56:54] [Applause]
[1:56:55] They were predest.
[1:57:00] They were once the angel. They were once
[1:57:02] the angels.
[1:57:04] They were once an angel who did not fall
[1:57:09] to the angel of heaven.
[1:57:12] That is those evil spirits
[1:57:16] walking
[1:57:17] walking very religious
[1:57:21] okay walking among the people very
[1:57:24] religious you know the Bible says that
[1:57:27] you was just not always here
[1:57:30] you were somewhere else before
[1:57:35] we were in his thoughts
[1:57:38] so even when there was war in heaven
[1:57:40] We stay with him.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; We did not reel.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; We did not repel.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; We did not rebel.
[1:57:49] We protest. Here we go.
[1:57:53] Because we were predestinated
[1:57:55] for life.
[1:57:57] We are part of life. Life is our
[1:58:00] identity.
[1:58:02] We can't be satisfied.
[1:58:04] Nothing that is not life.
[1:58:09] So what am I saying?
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; and his cohort when they were cast down
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; they lose theiration.
[1:58:19] They lost their estate.
[1:58:22] It become Satan.
[1:58:24] The angels become demons
[1:58:27] and they were cast out from heaven.
[1:58:30] When they were cast on the earth,
[1:58:33] they lost their place
[1:58:37] and he was wandering up and down
[1:58:42] because a man that does not have a house
[1:58:44] wonders.
[1:58:48] That's why today he's a wonderer.
[1:58:54] I'm quoting scripture. The enemy is
[1:58:57] going up and down looking for to divor
[1:59:04] and his demons.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; But get something clear.
[1:59:09] Get something clear.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; God did not take the power from them.
[1:59:18] Only what they lost
[1:59:20] was their estate
[1:59:23] and their habitation.
[1:59:27] But their power
[1:59:29] was still with them
[1:59:33] was still with them.
[1:59:36] So when they came they were rigaro
[1:59:40] rig maro that is moving
[1:59:46] with their power
[1:59:48] looking for who to devour looking for
[1:59:51] what to devour and let me tell you
[1:59:53] something. When they were cast down from
[1:59:56] heaven,
[1:59:58] God see to it, God saw to it that he did
[2:00:03] not allow all the angel to be marrowing.
[2:00:08] He b some of them because of their
[2:00:10] fierceness
[2:00:13] in some quarters.
[2:00:17] Not every angel was ready to read.
[2:00:21] There were some
[2:00:24] that were banned in rebu.
[2:00:29] They were banned in rebu
[2:00:38] collapse.
[2:00:41] So they were banned.
[2:00:47] So we burn
[2:00:49] the chain of darkness in in the of the
[2:00:52] lost.
[2:00:56] You know when you b prisoner
[2:00:59] he can't lose himself. He want to go out
[2:01:05] [Applause]
[2:01:08] but he's blessed.
[2:01:23] So we burn fruit.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; So we burn in hell
[2:01:32] just like that. So we released
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something because
[2:01:41] they still have their power
[2:01:44] and go lose them.
[2:01:48] If God lose them,
[2:01:52] they will not be hurt.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; So, some were released,
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; some were released.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; And Satan,
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; who is the Lucifer?
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was the prince of the
[2:02:07] power of the air.
[2:02:11] How did he become the priest of the
[2:02:12] power of the air?
[2:02:15] When he was cast down,
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; he came to Eden.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; He met Adam.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Adam was a god in Eden.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Everything was under Adam
[2:02:31] because he was a son of God.
[2:02:34] A son of God have the power of God.
[2:02:41] A son of God. The power of God.
[2:02:45] He better than them because of Adam know
[2:02:49] who he is.
[2:02:53] He know his position.
[2:02:56] There is nothing Lucifer can do.
[2:03:00] He just tell him move. Leave here, leave
[2:03:03] here. He will leave.
[2:03:10] must respect him
[2:03:12] because there's something we should we
[2:03:14] should know in the spirit world.
[2:03:18] They follow order
[2:03:22] in the spirit realm
[2:03:25] there is
[2:03:27] in the spirit realm they follow order
[2:03:31] they don't follow no title does not work
[2:03:34] in spirit
[2:03:37] it is order that work in spirit
[2:03:42] What are you?
[2:03:44] Are you a son of God? Are you a daughter
[2:03:46] of God? That is what operate spirit
[2:03:48] train. Are you a demon?
[2:03:52] Are you light? Are you darkness? This is
[2:03:55] what work is spirit train
[2:04:00] does not work.
[2:04:03] Amen. I am pope. I am bishop. I am
[2:04:06] apostle. It doesn't work.
[2:04:13] Title only work in the name of the
[2:04:16] motors
[2:04:19] and title is as a result of falling
[2:04:24] falling falling
[2:04:26] fall.
[2:04:29] When God make us in the beginning
[2:04:32] men and women
[2:04:35] brothers and sisters
[2:04:39] daughters
[2:04:40] work
[2:04:45] [Applause]
[2:04:48] in the spirit realm.
[2:04:50] Pope does not work.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Bishop does not work
[2:04:58] does not work.
[2:05:00] What work? Are you a son?
[2:05:03] Are you a daughter? Are you life? Are
[2:05:07] you
[2:05:09] [Applause]
[2:05:11] spirit does not they don't recognize
[2:05:13] title
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; they recognize authority.
[2:05:20] So when a demon come now you say I'm
[2:05:23] coming to you as pope
[2:05:26] doesn't know demon doesn't know pope
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; they want to know are you light are you
[2:05:33] darkness
[2:05:34] [Applause]
[2:05:38] this title we carried up and down I am
[2:05:42] senior apostle
[2:05:44] it doesn't work
[2:05:47] doesn't know what your They recognize
[2:05:50] authority.
[2:05:52] What is your authority?
[2:05:54] This is why in the book of Isaiah
[2:05:57] chapter 6,
[2:06:00] Isaiah was born a prophet.
[2:06:02] Not just a prophet.
[2:06:05] Isaiah was born a prophet.
[2:06:08] He was a major prophet.
[2:06:11] And he had been so influenced. He has
[2:06:13] been so influenced
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; by Uzziah
[2:06:19] like Kingiah
[2:06:24] and when Uzziah
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; misbehaved
[2:06:30] and God handle him.
[2:06:36] This is way God operate
[2:06:38] is no respect of anybody.
[2:06:43] God turned into a leper.
[2:06:47] That was I open.
[2:06:50] He ran to the temple.
[2:06:52] When to the temple as he was crying,
[2:06:57] God opened his eyes.
[2:07:00] He saw heaven. He saw God lifted up in
[2:07:02] his throne.
[2:07:06] They were in position worship. Holy,
[2:07:10] holy, holy. Holy
[2:07:17] was brought
[2:07:19] to the presence of the so when the were
[2:07:22] moving
[2:07:24] holy holy
[2:07:27] holy holy
[2:07:32] they could not look at God
[2:07:35] they use their way to cover their eyes
[2:07:36] he
[2:07:38] to cover their feet
[2:07:40] behind
[2:07:43] As they were moving, one of the one of
[2:07:46] them
[2:07:48] was hanging them. He said, "What are you
[2:07:50] doing?"
[2:07:54] I am a man of uncle
[2:07:58] people.
[2:08:02] are not qualified to stand
[2:08:07] a prophet.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; He could not fit in when he saw the
[2:08:11] presence of God.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; The title does not work in God's
[2:08:14] presence.
[2:08:18] He could not open his mouth
[2:08:21] say I am a prophet. Prophet for what?
[2:08:26] It is holiness.
[2:08:29] [Applause]
[2:08:32] He screamed
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; I am a sinner.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; I am not qualified. That is who
[2:08:37] everybody is
[2:08:40] in the presence of God.
[2:08:42] Nothing like pope. Nothing like
[2:08:44] arbishop.
[2:08:46] Nothing like anything. Either you are a
[2:08:48] son or a daughter or you out.
[2:08:55] So when you see men today
[2:08:58] with title,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; they laden, they put title on their
[2:09:08] motors.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Those are motors.
[2:09:12] Motor mean flesh. Flesh
[2:09:16] that don't understand heavenly precept.
[2:09:20] This is why this is why the prophet
[2:09:23] taught me you
[2:09:25] if you love me call me brother
[2:09:31] because in the presence of the
[2:09:33] heavenlies in the presence of the
[2:09:35] heavenlies in the region of the spirit
[2:09:42] a sister, a son, a daughter.
[2:09:48] [Applause]
[2:09:53] This is the prophet was teaching us
[2:09:55] heavily heavenly chronology,
[2:09:58] evil terminologies.
[2:10:01] Call me brotherh
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:09] sinner.
[2:10:13] Either you a sister
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; or a sinner and a sinner cannot call to
[2:10:18] God's presence
[2:10:21] because God is holy.
[2:10:23] This is why we don't just call anybody
[2:10:26] brother
[2:10:29] before you become a brother in this
[2:10:30] church.
[2:10:32] If you are coming the first time we
[2:10:35] can't just call you brother because it
[2:10:37] take qualification to become a brother.
[2:10:42] Before you can be called a brother, you
[2:10:44] must believe what you believe.
[2:10:48] You must believe what you believe.
[2:10:51] You must repent. You must be baptized in
[2:10:54] the name of Jesus Christ. You must
[2:10:57] become a brother.
[2:11:00] When you are not going through that
[2:11:01] process,
[2:11:03] you are not yet a brother.
[2:11:12] you a visitor.
[2:11:14] You may be coming every day. You have
[2:11:17] not go through this process.
[2:11:20] You are a visitor.
[2:11:24] You are not yet a brother.
[2:11:26] There are things that qualify you to be
[2:11:28] a brother.
[2:11:30] Assembly.
[2:11:34] You must have heard the gospel
[2:11:36] because the commission given to us,
[2:11:39] go into the world and preach God.
[2:11:42] If the believer baptized
[2:11:45] is a brother,
[2:11:48] if you are not yet baptized,
[2:11:51] he's not a brother.
[2:11:57] You are not a brother.
[2:11:59] Because there are things that indop you
[2:12:04] into the fellowship of this church
[2:12:07] in ministries.
[2:12:10] The thing that he do you
[2:12:13] as a brother is water baptism
[2:12:17] in Jesus Christ name
[2:12:19] you become a brother here.
[2:12:23] Now listen even when you are a brother
[2:12:25] here you are not qualified to vote.
[2:12:30] Except
[2:12:32] except after you have been baptized you
[2:12:36] are not coming every time
[2:12:40] you will support this church with your
[2:12:43] tithe with your offering and you are not
[2:12:46] qualified.
[2:12:51] If you are a brother and you are not
[2:12:54] coming every time and you are not paying
[2:12:56] your tithe and your offering
[2:12:59] this church to support the cause. When
[2:13:01] they want to vote
[2:13:06] when you vote, when they are voting,
[2:13:09] it's a vote of ringing.
[2:13:15] It's a vote of ringing
[2:13:18] the election
[2:13:20] because you are not qualified.
[2:13:24] [Applause]
[2:13:25] Hallelujah.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; He's a boat of rigging.
[2:13:30] He's a dubious boat.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:13:36] no, the kingdom of God.
[2:13:41] The election
[2:13:43] was not free and fair
[2:13:45] because of your vote.
[2:13:52] [Applause]
[2:13:55] And if you're a brotherh
[2:13:59] and if you're a brother
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; and you are coming every time
[2:14:07] then you pay your offering.
[2:14:10] You pay your tithe, you are a brother,
[2:14:13] you are qualified now in the say so. In
[2:14:17] the same so
[2:14:21] you can be voted for.
[2:14:23] and you can vote.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; That still does not make you a brother
[2:14:30] of God.
[2:14:32] You are still not a brother in the
[2:14:34] kingdom of God. You only a brother in
[2:14:38] ministry
[2:14:40] because there are things that will
[2:14:42] disqualify you as a brother in the
[2:14:45] kingdom of God.
[2:14:51] And when you are not a brother
[2:14:54] in the kingdom of God, be be careful.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; You cannot cast out demon.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; All I know Jesus I know. Who are you?
[2:15:06] People will ask you who are you?
[2:15:10] [Applause]
[2:15:12] [Music]
[2:15:14] So there are things that will qualify
[2:15:16] you to be a brother.
[2:15:19] in the kingdom of God. And when you
[2:15:22] become a brother in the kingdom of God,
[2:15:25] you are embraced in heaven.
[2:15:29] Amen. Now listen. When you are now
[2:15:32] embraced in in heaven,
[2:15:35] Satan cannot touch you again
[2:15:39] because you are still away from the
[2:15:40] kingdom of this world.
[2:15:46] And it take a power to do that.
[2:15:49] It is the power. We talking about this
[2:15:52] morning. Power that is in us.
[2:15:58] Power that is in us.
[2:16:01] This what we are talking about this
[2:16:02] morning.
[2:16:04] So listen, if you have not received that
[2:16:06] power
[2:16:08] opportunity for you to receive it now
[2:16:12] to be a brother in the kingdom of God
[2:16:16] because the Bible say by one spirit, we
[2:16:19] are being baptized to the body of
[2:16:20] Christ.
[2:16:22] When you are into the body of Christ,
[2:16:24] you are a brother kingdom of God.
[2:16:34] You become a brother,
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; then Satan cannot touch you again.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Then you have been given power
[2:16:42] to cast out Satan.
[2:16:45] That says, "This sign shall follow those
[2:16:48] that believe
[2:16:50] in my name. They cast a demon.
[2:16:54] of demon is the respons of a brother
[2:17:00] and a sister.
[2:17:04] Amen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in John chapter
[2:17:07] one
[2:17:10] John chapter one,
[2:17:12] he came to his own
[2:17:14] so receive not.
[2:17:17] But as many that receiveth him, he gave
[2:17:19] them power.
[2:17:20] [Applause]
[2:17:22] He gave them power.
[2:17:24] But because sons and daughters
[2:17:27] born by flesh
[2:17:30] by sex,
[2:17:32] they were not born by the church but
[2:17:35] they were born by God
[2:17:38] because the way our parents gave birth
[2:17:42] to us, they will become human being.
[2:17:46] God have to give birth to you to become
[2:17:49] a fellow in the house of God
[2:17:52] is a birth just as we have our father
[2:17:57] and our mother
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; that meet together
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; by their only union by their wedlock
[2:18:04] holy wedlock to bring us here. That is
[2:18:08] the same way for you to enter the
[2:18:10] kingdom of God.
[2:18:12] A father and a mother has to meet again
[2:18:17] for you to be born.
[2:18:19] Then you will ask me who is our mother
[2:18:23] in the kingdom of God is faith. Faith is
[2:18:27] our mother in the kingdom of God. God is
[2:18:31] our father in the kingdom of God. So
[2:18:33] faith in the word of God came there to
[2:18:35] you.
[2:18:40] Faith is our mother.
[2:18:42] And God is our father and God is the
[2:18:44] word. This is why faith cometh by
[2:18:47] hearing by the word. So when you hear
[2:18:50] the word of God and your faith join with
[2:18:52] it, you will be born.
[2:19:00] They become a candidate
[2:19:03] in the kingdom of God.
[2:19:06] And that's why when you are like that,
[2:19:09] when you are like that, Satan cannot get
[2:19:12] you
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; because you have been sealed
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ.
[2:19:20] This is why Ephesians chapter 2:30 said,
[2:19:25] "Grieve not the Holy Ghost."
[2:19:28] Ephesians 4:30,
[2:19:30] grieve not the Holy Ghost of God
[2:19:32] by which you were sealed.
[2:19:36] into the kingdom.
[2:19:38] So he says you have been sealing
[2:19:41] and when you want to seal you here
[2:19:44] Satan out from you
[2:19:47] the only way Satan can get you the only
[2:19:49] way Satan can get you he must go through
[2:19:52] the same process you came through.
[2:19:55] He must hear the gospel. He must believe
[2:19:59] he must repent. He must be baptized. He
[2:20:01] must be filled with the spirit. And when
[2:20:04] it happen like that to him, he become a
[2:20:06] brother also.
[2:20:09] He will not be a satanic.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; It's a process. It's a process. It's a
[2:20:16] procedure.
[2:20:18] It's a procedure. A process
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; you must go through. So don't just come
[2:20:23] and sit down here. Say, I am a believer
[2:20:26] of God. I'm going to rapture.
[2:20:29] I'm going to rapture. No.
[2:20:32] There are things that qualify you to be
[2:20:34] a candidate
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:42] qualify you to be a candidate.
[2:20:48] Sitting down here
[2:20:51] does not qualify you.
[2:20:54] You have to pass through process.
[2:20:58] That's why you are here this morning.
[2:21:00] and you have not yet passed through this
[2:21:02] process.
[2:21:03] This is your due of visitation
[2:21:10] because we have been taught when rapture
[2:21:12] happen this beauty is not going rapture.
[2:21:19] This beauty this beauty this beauty is
[2:21:22] not going rapture. This is not going all
[2:21:26] the microphone will still be here.
[2:21:28] Our people will still be here. That's
[2:21:31] it. People they will still be here.
[2:21:36] They will be in church where has
[2:21:38] happened after that happen.
[2:21:42] They will still come to church.
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:47] Now tell you tell yourself I am I'm not
[2:21:50] the person.
[2:21:52] Tell yourself I'm not that person.
[2:21:55] People will gather here.
[2:21:57] They will listen song.
[2:22:00] They will be waiting for the pastor
[2:22:03] to come and preach to them. But the real
[2:22:05] people of God has gone.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Tell yourself, I will not be here.
[2:22:19] And we are going to see it. We are going
[2:22:22] to see it. How you will know
[2:22:25] if you will not be here.
[2:22:34] There is nothing be everything has been
[2:22:36] open.
[2:22:40] Are you there Mr. Shoot me? Who is this
[2:22:44] mech paragraph 42?
[2:22:49] Who is this mech? Let's go back to
[2:22:51] paragraph 42. Now let me show you
[2:22:53] something. This Bible has been like a
[2:22:57] sculptural work
[2:23:00] that has been covered up. Give me
[2:23:03] that be covered up.
[2:23:06] God promise in this last day he will
[2:23:09] open it.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; No, 44. 44 is okay.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; 42.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; 42. Where is it?
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; 42.
[2:23:19] 42. Notice
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; like the sculptor
[2:23:24] He hides
[2:23:27] with a mask over it.
[2:23:30] That is what God has done to this age.
[2:23:33] It has been he
[2:23:36] all this thing has been healed
[2:23:39] and is supposed to be revealed in this
[2:23:42] age.
[2:23:45] Yes. This you are hearing is the you are
[2:23:47] hearing now.
[2:23:49] Now the Bible says they will be revealed
[2:23:52] in the latter times.
[2:23:55] It's like a sculptor
[2:23:57] keeping his piece of work all covered
[2:23:59] over
[2:24:01] until the time he takes the mask off of
[2:24:04] it.
[2:24:06] And there it is. And that is what the
[2:24:09] Bible has been. It has been a work of
[2:24:14] God that have been covered up and it has
[2:24:18] been hid
[2:24:19] the foundation of the world and the
[2:24:22] sevenfold mystery
[2:24:24] that God promised
[2:24:26] in this day at the age of the church. We
[2:24:31] will take the mask off of the whole
[2:24:33] thing and we proceed.
[2:24:37] So this is you are hearing the
[2:24:39] revelation have been given to us
[2:24:41] according to God's promise
[2:24:44] and we
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; a little group of people. We are
[2:24:48] enjoying the revelation.
[2:24:51] We are enjoying the blessing.
[2:24:54] This you are hearing now. You can't hear
[2:24:57] it in denomination.
[2:24:59] Everywhere we scatter
[2:25:02] because the Bible says wherever the cak
[2:25:04] is the ego we gather
[2:25:09] and their ego this is our food
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; and we are feasting on them we are
[2:25:18] feasting on our food
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; what I say
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Satan
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; stand
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; it was moving up and
[2:25:31] with his demons
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; and he came to the garden.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; He met Adam.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you will take it.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Adam was the one that named Satan.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Satan name Satan. Satan.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; The name Satan. Give Satan that name
[2:25:53] Satan. Okay.
[2:25:56] Adam
[2:25:58] [Applause]
[2:26:02] because of his behavior.
[2:26:04] He saw a creature
[2:26:07] just marrowing up and down.
[2:26:10] Adam look said you shall be called
[2:26:12] Satan.
[2:26:14] That's why tomorrow he said he was not
[2:26:16] named Satan in heaven.
[2:26:20] It was Lucifer in heaven. When he came
[2:26:22] to earth, it was the god of this earth
[2:26:27] that name is Satan.
[2:26:30] Then the angels that fell with them and
[2:26:34] then look at them called demons
[2:26:38] devils.
[2:26:43] That was not their name in heaven.
[2:26:46] So when they fell down from our
[2:26:48] habitation
[2:26:50] and they fell down to the earth, Adam
[2:26:52] was the god here.
[2:26:54] He named everything
[2:26:59] he name everything. So when you see
[2:27:01] these strange creatures
[2:27:04] you the way you are behaving you are
[2:27:07] demon you the way you are behaving you
[2:27:10] are satan. That's when we say demon.
[2:27:13] Demon is a tormentor.
[2:27:16] Anything that torment is demon.
[2:27:21] When you have a husband at home, if you
[2:27:24] are a wife that is tormenting you, is a
[2:27:27] demon.
[2:27:29] When you have a wife at home that is
[2:27:31] tormenting you, he's a demon.
[2:27:35] Demon demon to make
[2:27:37] their characteristics.
[2:27:40] So when they come our sickness they
[2:27:43] torment when they come anywhere they
[2:27:46] come they torment when they come here
[2:27:49] now they will cause confusion here but
[2:27:51] they can't do anything here we are in
[2:27:54] the presence of God
[2:27:58] we have been given authority
[2:28:01] cast them out
[2:28:04] [Applause]
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; so when you see a sister
[2:28:10] Restless,
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; restless sister,
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; just restless.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Not comfortable.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Looking for confusion.
[2:28:20] Looking for trouble. There's a demon in
[2:28:22] that person.
[2:28:26] Is demon in that person
[2:28:29] because when this demon fell
[2:28:32] as I told you, so we binged over.
[2:28:36] Some were banned in chain of some were
[2:28:39] permitted to to wander up and down.
[2:28:44] Those that were permitted to wander up
[2:28:46] and down,
[2:28:48] they are not the spirit that give men
[2:28:51] nature.
[2:28:54] So when you see a man who is an
[2:28:56] adulterer,
[2:28:58] who is an adulterer, there's a demon of
[2:29:01] adultery in that man.
[2:29:06] Adulter
[2:29:08] is a demon.
[2:29:09] [Applause]
[2:29:13] Fornication is a demon.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Fornication.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Fornication is a demon. Loss is a demon.
[2:29:23] Stealing is a demon.
[2:29:25] Someone is a demon.
[2:29:29] They demon that give people nature.
[2:29:33] So when you because they are spirit they
[2:29:35] need a place to beat. So when they enter
[2:29:38] their flesh they gave them nature
[2:29:43] possess that demon
[2:29:45] is a demon that possess them push them
[2:29:48] to do what they do
[2:29:52] that push them to do what they do.
[2:30:01] He push them because every spirit that
[2:30:05] is in you have infl
[2:30:14] witchcraft. It's a spirit.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[2:30:22] So when he come into somebody possess
[2:30:25] the person
[2:30:27] the way the holy ghost possess us
[2:30:30] possess them
[2:30:34] he possess them to do evil
[2:30:37] this is why when you see a sinner
[2:30:41] does anything good
[2:30:44] is by mistake
[2:30:50] is by mistake
[2:30:52] Because the demon in there always wanted
[2:30:55] to be doing evil.
[2:30:58] It is the same thing when you see a
[2:31:00] Christian fil with the Holy Ghost does
[2:31:03] anything wrong, make a mistake
[2:31:09] because it's a demon that is in you
[2:31:13] control you.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; This is why by the grace of God is not
[2:31:19] difficult today.
[2:31:21] to know a man
[2:31:24] that had the Holy Spirit.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; It's not difficult.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; It's not difficult except you don't know
[2:31:32] the scripture. If you know scripture,
[2:31:35] you will know how to identify spirit
[2:31:40] because spirit are identified by their
[2:31:42] characteristics.
[2:31:45] Yes, sir. They have characters.
[2:31:48] That's why the work of a man
[2:31:51] The character of a man is made known by
[2:31:53] his work.
[2:31:55] That's why Jesus Christ said, "By their
[2:31:57] fruit, you shall know them."
[2:32:02] And let me tell you one thing about
[2:32:03] demon. Let me tell you one thing about
[2:32:06] demon
[2:32:08] because they were angels.
[2:32:10] They were in heaven. They were
[2:32:13] worshiping before they were cast down.
[2:32:16] They are very religious.
[2:32:21] They are very religious
[2:32:25] and that is why except you know the
[2:32:28] scripture when a man stand by the Holy
[2:32:31] Ghost
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; and a man is demon possessed you know
[2:32:35] the difference
[2:32:37] you are in the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[2:32:40] because spirit spirit spirit recognize
[2:32:44] spirit
[2:32:47] demon preach the gospel
[2:32:51] Demon are behind puppets.
[2:32:54] Let me come to puppet.
[2:32:56] Let me come to puppet.
[2:33:00] If you want to know a demon in the
[2:33:01] public,
[2:33:03] any man that stand behind a puppet and
[2:33:06] preach anything contrary to the word of
[2:33:09] God,
[2:33:18] any man that will stand behind a puppet
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; and he will tell you what the Bible say
[2:33:24] does not mean
[2:33:27] that is demon.
[2:33:29] [Applause]
[2:33:31] any man they will stand behind a puppet.
[2:33:34] I try to explain the Bible, interpret
[2:33:37] the Bible,
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; any man that stand behind the tried to
[2:33:46] change what the Bible has written,
[2:33:49] that is an enticing spirit.
[2:33:52] [Music]
[2:33:53] In a church when you see people gather
[2:33:58] and make carry the Bible and make carry
[2:34:01] the Bible, they come to church and that
[2:34:04] church
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; teaches things that are contrary to the
[2:34:09] Bible. are demons
[2:34:18] practice things do things that are
[2:34:22] contrary to the Bible those are demon
[2:34:25] that's what the Bible warn you and me
[2:34:28] say in the last days they shall show
[2:34:30] great signs and wonders
[2:34:33] that if it were possible they will
[2:34:36] deceive the very
[2:34:38] men possessed with demon
[2:34:42] That is why you will ask me but they are
[2:34:45] doing miracles. They doing such are
[2:34:47] wonders.
[2:34:49] They are doing miracles.
[2:34:51] Wonder do miracles.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Demon do miracles.
[2:35:01] They do signs and wonders.
[2:35:04] But how you catch them? Bring them to
[2:35:07] the wall.
[2:35:10] bring them to the wall. They can't stay
[2:35:12] with the wall because they did not stay
[2:35:14] with the word yesterday.
[2:35:16] Stay with the war today
[2:35:18] with Lucifer.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; They fell with Lucifer
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; and they in her
[2:35:29] talking about power.
[2:35:32] Demons have power.
[2:35:34] Satan have power. Then God have power.
[2:35:38] And I want to tell you something. All
[2:35:40] the power that Michael was having,
[2:35:43] Lucifer also have it.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; The only difference, he cannot create.
[2:35:49] This is why because it was the angel
[2:35:52] that was given that authority because he
[2:35:54] cannot create. He can pervert.
[2:36:00] He can pervert what is created.
[2:36:04] A lie. A lie is a truth perverted.
[2:36:10] That's why in Genesis when he came to
[2:36:13] the woman, it was serpent that came to
[2:36:15] preach false to the woman.
[2:36:18] In Genesis 3, he came with the word.
[2:36:23] He met the woman. He said, "What did God
[2:36:25] say?" He was the one that went for
[2:36:28] evangelism. He went for evangelism.
[2:36:32] He was looking for disciples.
[2:36:34] Then he made the woman. He said, "What
[2:36:37] did God say?" The woman said, "God has
[2:36:41] said,
[2:36:42] we shall eat of all the trees
[2:36:45] that is in the garden, but the tree of
[2:36:48] knowledge of good and evil, the day we
[2:36:51] touch it, we shall die."
[2:36:57] He said, "Lord,
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; you shall not surely die.
[2:37:04] For God know the day you eat your eyes
[2:37:07] will be open. You will be like God. Now
[2:37:11] listen now listen. The woman did not
[2:37:13] know. She was already a god.
[2:37:19] She didn't know because she was
[2:37:21] deceived.
[2:37:22] The woman she was a god but she didn't
[2:37:25] know. It is the same with you and me. We
[2:37:28] are god know. That is why the seven
[2:37:32] thunder will reveal
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; the seven thunders.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; The seven will reveal
[2:37:42] the entire Bible that week
[2:37:45] it will be hidden for you and me. So
[2:37:48] this will be God to pick all his
[2:37:51] subjects
[2:37:53] from everywhere they are to everywhere
[2:37:55] for everywhere they are. He repeat these
[2:37:58] seas.
[2:37:59] Repeat all his subjects
[2:38:02] from everywhere they are.
[2:38:05] Repeat to them.
[2:38:07] The Bible,
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; the Bible,
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Bible.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, "They that
[2:38:15] know their God
[2:38:19] shall be strong."
[2:38:21] And that's why today we have know our
[2:38:24] God.
[2:38:26] We know that the Jehovah of the Old
[2:38:29] Testament
[2:38:30] is the Jesus Christ of the New
[2:38:32] Testament.
[2:38:33] That Jesus Christ is the name of God
[2:38:38] is God's name of redemption
[2:38:41] because redemption came with a name.
[2:38:45] That's why I told you baptizing them in
[2:38:48] the name of the father and of the son
[2:38:50] and of the holy spirit the name of the
[2:38:52] father of the son of the spirit is Jesus
[2:38:55] Christ.
[2:38:56] [Applause]
[2:38:59] Now we all know who our God is.
[2:39:02] Any time that God reveal to you who he
[2:39:06] is, the next thing God does, he reveal
[2:39:09] to you who you are because we are in
[2:39:12] him.
[2:39:14] We are part of him. We are born of his
[2:39:18] flesh of his flesh. And today he has
[2:39:20] revealed to you and me that we are the
[2:39:23] bread of Jesus Christ.
[2:39:25] Amen.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; This is why we speak where the Bible
[2:39:28] speak
[2:39:30] and silent where the Bible silence
[2:39:33] we are subject to our husband
[2:39:36] in all ways.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; And because of that when he deceived the
[2:39:44] woman
[2:39:46] he perverted creation.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; He perverted the creation
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; through that intercourse.
[2:39:56] Let me talk about intercourse a little
[2:39:57] bit.
[2:40:00] Sex
[2:40:02] is an animal way, not God's way.
[2:40:07] It's not that God didn't give us sex.
[2:40:10] Animal taught us sex.
[2:40:17] Animal taught us how to sex.
[2:40:23] We should open this secrets
[2:40:26] have a place to be manipulating people.
[2:40:29] God did not give us sex.
[2:40:32] When you see people in the world, they
[2:40:35] will say sex was a very good God. God
[2:40:37] did not give sex.
[2:40:40] Animal
[2:40:46] way, not God way. Because it's not God
[2:40:49] way. That's why no children cannot come
[2:40:52] from God in that way.
[2:40:56] [Applause]
[2:40:57] He had his way
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; that he bring forth his children and the
[2:41:02] way of God is by the spoken word.
[2:41:06] [Applause]
[2:41:10] And that is why when we talk about sex,
[2:41:14] brother taught us,
[2:41:16] God permitted it because men choose it.
[2:41:22] The animal gave it to us, we choose it.
[2:41:25] Then God said, if that is the way you
[2:41:28] want to go,
[2:41:29] that's all right. That's why I told the
[2:41:31] woman it pays.
[2:41:34] It pays
[2:41:36] in sorrow. Will you give birth?
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; It's animal way. So before you give
[2:41:44] birth, you will go through sorrow, you
[2:41:47] will go through pain because of that.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Now listen
[2:41:56] and that is why
[2:41:58] even when God permits sex,
[2:42:01] he only permit it when a man is legally
[2:42:04] married.
[2:42:09] If you are not legally married, you
[2:42:12] don't have business with sex.
[2:42:14] The Bible calling fornication.
[2:42:17] He say flee fornication
[2:42:20] because every sin that a man committed
[2:42:23] is answer to the body. If I commit
[2:42:25] fornication against his own body.
[2:42:31] This is why today you will see women
[2:42:34] sometime they will give birth to
[2:42:36] children you don't even know the look
[2:42:38] look like you don't know the child look
[2:42:41] like
[2:42:43] one year
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; we resemble somebody
[2:42:48] else that girl involved in fornication
[2:42:53] and when the man deposit
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; oh brother let's go
[2:42:58] you laughing I'm in the spirit
[2:43:02] We don't laugh when we are in the
[2:43:03] spirit.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Are you okay?
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; It's not a laughing matter, brother.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; This is a truth.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:43:12] when that's why he told us
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; a woman was given a seal
[2:43:20] to seal our private part.
[2:43:23] It's a seal.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; And that seal was given a pack. That
[2:43:28] pack
[2:43:29] is a ciple with blood.
[2:43:33] That blood was not to be broken
[2:43:36] except you are married.
[2:43:40] When a man marry a woman. Now listen and
[2:43:45] he made the woman.
[2:43:49] There is something that woman put on
[2:43:50] that man.
[2:43:52] [Applause]
[2:43:54] Put that mark on that man.
[2:43:57] cannot fit that mark.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; He can't fix it. Can't fix it.
[2:44:12] That is why God hate fornication.
[2:44:18] He said, "Flee
[2:44:22] flee.
[2:44:24] flee fornication because every sin that
[2:44:26] a man sit
[2:44:28] outside his body that committed
[2:44:31] fornication sin against his own body.
[2:44:36] And that is why now listen
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; when you now marry that man
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; as a virgin
[2:44:46] as a virgin
[2:44:49] even when you live with that man
[2:44:53] 100 years
[2:44:56] to God you are still a virgin.
[2:45:02] When you live with one man,
[2:45:04] go look. If you like give birth to 20
[2:45:06] children
[2:45:09] in God's sight in God's kingdom, you are
[2:45:13] still a virgin.
[2:45:16] This is why you were not to break that
[2:45:20] seal
[2:45:23] with one man.
[2:45:25] When a woman went out, our sister, young
[2:45:29] woman, listen,
[2:45:32] when you go out like Dina
[2:45:35] and that seal is broken,
[2:45:39] God will mark you.
[2:45:43] When you did not marry that man,
[2:45:48] you become a sister
[2:45:50] qualified fil with the Holy Ghost
[2:45:54] and you want to now marry another person
[2:45:57] which you are qualified
[2:46:01] what God said. Tell that man you want to
[2:46:04] marry about that your seal that was
[2:46:06] broken.
[2:46:09] Tell him.
[2:46:12] If you did not tell him and you marry
[2:46:15] that man and you have three children,
[2:46:18] four children and discover he have a
[2:46:22] right to
[2:46:25] marry another person.
[2:46:27] You you can't marry again.
[2:46:32] This is the message of the hour.
[2:46:37] This is why Jesus you should know what
[2:46:40] you're doing. Don't let any man touch
[2:46:43] you
[2:46:45] from your head
[2:46:49] against you.
[2:46:52] And that is why every sin that a man
[2:46:54] commit
[2:46:56] can come under the blocks.
[2:46:58] But a girl that go out and fornicate
[2:47:05] and later now marry somebody else.
[2:47:08] But Abraham said
[2:47:10] she can be forgiven
[2:47:13] but she cannot be justified.
[2:47:16] The mark is on her
[2:47:20] because when God forgive you, he does
[2:47:22] not remember the sin again. this
[2:47:25] particular sin. I ever go forgive you,
[2:47:28] he will still remember it.
[2:47:32] He will still remember it.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; That's why we should teach our children
[2:47:37] free fornication.
[2:47:42] Free fornication.
[2:47:44] Don't let any man touch you as he has
[2:47:46] married you.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; There's a grievous consequence that go
[2:47:53] with it. consequence.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; This is the doctrine of the message.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; And a church without adultery is not the
[2:48:06] church.
[2:48:09] The backbone adultery is the backbone of
[2:48:11] the church.
[2:48:16] Backbone of the church.
[2:48:24] When you give birth to your daughters,
[2:48:28] hold their ear.
[2:48:30] This your se
[2:48:33] go there.
[2:48:39] Don't let anybody
[2:48:41] anything
[2:48:43] on your marriage. God says so.
[2:48:49] Unchangeable. God says so.
[2:48:53] Many people they will miss heaven
[2:48:58] because of these doctrines.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Because of these doctrines.
[2:49:04] Because of these doctrines. Because this
[2:49:06] is what God is going to use to judge the
[2:49:08] whole world.
[2:49:12] Don't let any man touch you
[2:49:16] except the marriage that be pronounced.
[2:49:21] at the all time.
[2:49:27] Don't let any man kiss you because when
[2:49:30] a man kiss you and it's not your husband
[2:49:33] is a potential adultery.
[2:49:36] You must confess it or you go to hell
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; because sex gland sex
[2:49:49] they in the lips.
[2:49:52] This is why we don't kiss our sisters
[2:49:56] when the Bible says
[2:49:59] only give a brother only kiss.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; It was a brother to a brother
[2:50:05] sister to a sister.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; When a brother want to kiss a brother,
[2:50:10] they will kiss it at the back of the
[2:50:12] ear.
[2:50:13] Bible call say give a brother a holy
[2:50:15] kiss. Holy kiss
[2:50:18] in the Bible. It was from a brother to a
[2:50:21] brother, sister to sister. A sister was
[2:50:24] not to kiss a brother.
[2:50:34] Adultery, a potential adultery.
[2:50:38] Brother kiss a sister
[2:50:41] is morally obligated to marry her
[2:50:45] or repent.
[2:50:48] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; So youth,
[2:50:52] this is the word of God. This is the
[2:50:55] mind of God. This is why God call you a
[2:50:58] believer.
[2:51:00] Because when you a believer, you should
[2:51:03] practice what you believe.
[2:51:06] A man who call a preacher
[2:51:10] and he cannot practice what he preach.
[2:51:13] Stop preaching it.
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; Stop preaching it.
[2:51:19] Stop preaching it. When you call a
[2:51:22] believer
[2:51:24] and you cannot follow the Bible
[2:51:25] instruction,
[2:51:27] you are not a believer.
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; Nonsense. We are seeing the message
[2:51:34] today.
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[2:51:37] [Music]
[2:51:39] Everywhere all tables are full of bomit.
[2:51:44] not see God manifesting our mess.
[2:51:46] [Applause]
[2:51:48] Foolishness everywhere.
[2:51:50] You see men behind the puppets.
[2:51:52] They'll be messing up with women.
[2:51:55] Shame on you.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Shame on you.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; The last time I came here,
[2:52:09] when Pastor Albert Green came,
[2:52:14] Pastoral told me
[2:52:17] said, "Bro,
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; I have another visitor.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; I want to send you somewhere so I can go
[2:52:22] and help the people there." He sent me
[2:52:24] to Rwanda.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. It was here I met that minister
[2:52:31] when I was in Kenya. I mean in Uganda
[2:52:35] then I called him. I want to just
[2:52:36] physically
[2:52:39] come. So I came I was taken to one
[2:52:42] church
[2:52:44] to preach. So while the preaching was
[2:52:46] going on the presence of God came down
[2:52:50] everywhere was full of in fact God came
[2:52:52] down. I called the ministers. I said
[2:52:56] please come lay hand on those people.
[2:53:00] There are too many for me so I pray
[2:53:02] prayer deliverance for them.
[2:53:05] one came to meet me. He said, "Pastor,
[2:53:08] I'm not qualified to lay hand on
[2:53:10] anybody."
[2:53:13] I said, "Are you not a servant of God?"
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; I have to tell you the truth. He said,
[2:53:17] "You lay upon me."
[2:53:21] He said, "First of all, lay hand upon
[2:53:22] him
[2:53:24] to do deliverance for him."
[2:53:29] What was it? It was a sin of
[2:53:32] fornication.
[2:53:35] He has not had victory.
[2:53:39] He was still possessed with the demon of
[2:53:41] fornication
[2:53:44] and he was a pastor.
[2:53:48] When you are a minister
[2:53:51] and you are possessed with demo of
[2:53:53] anything
[2:53:55] that is not the Holy Ghost, that is the
[2:53:57] spirit you be spreading in the church.
[2:54:02] You can't give what you don't have.
[2:54:04] It is what you have you can give her.
[2:54:10] The people in the church will be
[2:54:11] fornicating
[2:54:13] the spirit that is in you.
[2:54:17] This is why nobody have a right to claim
[2:54:21] the puppet to preach the gospel. He has
[2:54:25] not met God face to face.
[2:54:28] Nobody.
[2:54:32] Nobody have a right.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; You may have your calling,
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; but you must meet God
[2:54:42] to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Then
[2:54:45] you are qualified to stand behind a
[2:54:47] puppet and preach deliverance and people
[2:54:50] will be delivered
[2:54:52] because if you're not delivered, you can
[2:54:54] deliver anybody.
[2:54:57] Jesus, he look at Peter. He said Simon
[2:55:00] Simon
[2:55:02] Satan want to shift you like a wheat.
[2:55:05] I have pray for you that your faith not
[2:55:08] fail
[2:55:10] converted.
[2:55:14] No man is converted.
[2:55:16] The Holy Ghost
[2:55:23] have the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost give you
[2:55:26] power to cast out demons. And let me
[2:55:29] tell you something. When you are
[2:55:31] preaching under the influence of the
[2:55:33] Holy Ghost, demons are scattered in your
[2:55:36] church.
[2:55:37] That's why I believe now
[2:55:40] are scatter
[2:55:48] because the spirit of God will anoint
[2:55:50] you
[2:55:52] to preach deliverance.
[2:55:55] And every message you preach will be a
[2:55:58] message of deliverance
[2:56:00] because you have been delivered.
[2:56:03] You take a delivered man to deliver
[2:56:05] somebody.
[2:56:07] And that's why you saw the seven of scas
[2:56:12] they went to go and meet a mad man.
[2:56:15] I said in the name of Jesus
[2:56:18] that Paul preached that Peter preach
[2:56:24] said I know Jesus I know Paul who are
[2:56:28] you
[2:56:30] demon know you know me
[2:56:36] they can't leave
[2:56:38] when they know you one controlling your
[2:56:40] life
[2:56:44] they can't leave anybody.
[2:56:52] They can't.
[2:56:54] And many times when a minister stand
[2:56:56] behind the pulpit
[2:56:59] say many times,
[2:57:02] pastors allow evil spirit to sit down in
[2:57:04] their churches.
[2:57:05] allow evil spirits to enter the object.
[2:57:10] Our gathering
[2:57:12] is not the gathering of foul spirits.
[2:57:16] It's not the application of foul spirit
[2:57:18] [Music]
[2:57:20] of every unclean bed
[2:57:24] when you see a sister coming to church
[2:57:27] and is dressing naked when the pastor of
[2:57:30] the Holy Spirit he will cast it out.
[2:57:36] I didn't say you should cast
[2:57:39] out
[2:57:45] by the gospel
[2:57:49] by the gospel through your preaching.
[2:57:52] That demon will not be comfortable.
[2:57:55] He will leave.
[2:57:59] What are we saying?
[2:58:01] went through sex.
[2:58:05] Our ways were perverted. Our ways were
[2:58:12] as serpent meet the woman.
[2:58:16] [Music]
[2:58:18] Before Adam made the woman, serpent made
[2:58:20] the woman.
[2:58:26] planted an evil seed inside our womb.
[2:58:32] That is the beginning of the serpent
[2:58:34] seed.
[2:58:38] Every child
[2:58:40] that will come on earth from that time
[2:58:43] that
[2:58:47] through the womb of a woman
[2:58:50] was of a few days
[2:58:52] and full of trouble. He was born in sin.
[2:58:56] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:58:59] speaking lies.
[2:59:01] This is why you don't tell children, you
[2:59:03] don't teach them how to tell lies.
[2:59:08] There is something I see in our churches
[2:59:10] these day
[2:59:12] that we are not teaching our children.
[2:59:15] The Bible says teach the children the
[2:59:18] way they should go
[2:59:20] that when they grow up they shall not
[2:59:23] depart.
[2:59:26] It is a commandment of the scripture.
[2:59:30] It's a commandment of the Lord. But many
[2:59:33] of us believe we are failing.
[2:59:36] And let me tell you what what you get.
[2:59:38] Whatever you sow, you will reap it. When
[2:59:42] we fail to teach our children, they will
[2:59:45] give us trouble.
[2:59:49] This is what was going on in the
[2:59:50] believer cycle. Now, we don't teach our
[2:59:53] children.
[2:59:55] Do you know the prophet taught me and
[2:59:56] you
[2:59:58] every house should have a family altar?
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; Every house
[3:00:06] family al
[3:00:12] family altar
[3:00:14] that they meet God
[3:00:17] in the morning and in the night.
[3:00:21] It is a recommendation of the scriptures
[3:00:25] because the Bible says we should teach
[3:00:27] them the way they should go that when
[3:00:29] they grow up they should not depart.
[3:00:32] Even when they try to depart the thing
[3:00:35] we not depart from them
[3:00:39] in the morning. But Abraham said, "We
[3:00:43] have to gather our family together
[3:00:46] and pray with them and read the Bible
[3:00:50] and talk to them."
[3:00:53] Brother Abraham said that was what Jesse
[3:00:56] was doing
[3:00:58] and David catch the revelation
[3:01:00] that they covenant people that they
[3:01:02] covenant people. That was why he killed
[3:01:06] the beer, he killed the liar, kill
[3:01:08] Golars. It was what the father taught
[3:01:11] him in the family altar
[3:01:17] said we should have it.
[3:01:23] &gt;&gt; He said we should give our children
[3:01:25] Bible
[3:01:27] teach Bible story
[3:01:30] told us that is the respect of a woman.
[3:01:35] He said the mother is the fifth gospel.
[3:01:38] She's the pastor of the house
[3:01:41] children. You should teach them about
[3:01:43] God
[3:01:45] because if you did not do that, Satan
[3:01:48] will give them inspiration
[3:01:51] and they will give you problem.
[3:01:56] Our women today, many of them are
[3:01:59] guilty.
[3:02:01] Many of they are guilty.
[3:02:03] Many of them are guilty.
[3:02:07] And you'll be wondering
[3:02:09] when your daughter want to marry when
[3:02:12] your daughter want to marry
[3:02:14] is looking for unbeliever to marry.
[3:02:18] Your son want to marry is looking for
[3:02:20] believer to marry.
[3:02:22] The foundation is the cause.
[3:02:27] Foundation is the cause.
[3:02:29] Because we have been taught,
[3:02:31] &gt;&gt; we have been taught under no
[3:02:33] circumstance,
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; under no circumstance
[3:02:38] should a believer marry a nonbeliever.
[3:02:43] Under no circumstance
[3:02:46] a believer should marry a believer.
[3:02:50] And if you want to marry, the prophet
[3:02:52] said, marry a man that believe exactly
[3:02:57] like you believe.
[3:03:00] Marry a woman that believe exactly what
[3:03:03] you
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; because if you didn't do that you will
[3:03:10] have problem
[3:03:12] today. What are we seeing in our
[3:03:14] churches divorce divorce?
[3:03:20] Lose puppets,
[3:03:23] lose family,
[3:03:25] lose children.
[3:03:29] Miracle for churches
[3:03:32] should be far from us.
[3:03:35] God hate divorce. God hates
[3:03:41] God hate it.
[3:03:42] And this is why we should be taught that
[3:03:46] this is not the will of God. We are the
[3:03:48] people of God.
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; We should follow the will of God.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; Where you want to marry
[3:03:57] say sit down
[3:03:59] and think about it. Put it to God in
[3:04:02] prayer.
[3:04:04] Why? Because God is the one that know
[3:04:06] the heart of any man.
[3:04:11] Let me tell you something
[3:04:13] told us as we are sitting down here
[3:04:17] even in heaven when there are meeting
[3:04:19] going on
[3:04:21] Satan come to attend the meeting.
[3:04:26] So if Satan can still go to heaven
[3:04:30] to attend meeting, what about our
[3:04:32] meeting?
[3:04:35] When we gather together,
[3:04:37] we bring somebody in and sit down
[3:04:39] quietly.
[3:04:47] He will behave like a brother. He be
[3:04:50] like a sister. He's not a sister. He's
[3:04:53] not a brother. are broken
[3:04:57] to cause confusion
[3:04:59] cause confusion
[3:05:01] to cause confusion and that is why when
[3:05:04] you are a brother you are looking for a
[3:05:07] sister a wife. How do you know the one
[3:05:11] that Satan brought?
[3:05:13] How do you know the one that God
[3:05:15] brought? Only one person know that and
[3:05:17] that is God.
[3:05:21] And this is why you must seek the face
[3:05:23] of God.
[3:05:26] When a sister comes to your mind, go and
[3:05:28] meet God. Is this your will for me?
[3:05:36] Is this your will for me?
[3:05:39] Don't look at education.
[3:05:42] Don't look at job. Don't look at money.
[3:05:45] look away to Jesus
[3:05:47] [Music]
[3:05:49] because that thing will cause you
[3:05:51] problem in your life.
[3:05:56] And
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. When Satan
[3:05:58] cannot get you in the way of salvation,
[3:06:02] he will wait for you in the way of
[3:06:04] marriage.
[3:06:07] That's why this marriage we talking
[3:06:08] about, it is marriage that will take
[3:06:10] many people to hell.
[3:06:17] your salvation God has chosen it but
[3:06:21] marriage you choose for yourself
[3:06:25] that is why you must be careful don't
[3:06:28] choose by sight
[3:06:31] don't choose by beauty
[3:06:33] don't choose by popularity
[3:06:35] the father is a pastor the mother is a
[3:06:38] this don't choose by that choose by
[3:06:42] faith
[3:06:47] Today
[3:06:49] we are begin to be calculating people's
[3:06:51] life.
[3:06:54] This brother
[3:06:56] he had just finished for university.
[3:06:59] He has good future. Who told university
[3:07:02] give future?
[3:07:05] Who told you that university give good
[3:07:08] future?
[3:07:10] Future come from God.
[3:07:14] Because our life is in the hand of God.
[3:07:20] We begin to calculate. He just finished
[3:07:23] university. He has a good job. He has a
[3:07:26] good house. He has a good future.
[3:07:29] You are the one calculating.
[3:07:31] God says so.
[3:07:36] And you will see a brother that love
[3:07:39] God. He's filled with the Holy Ghost.
[3:07:42] He's still trusting on God
[3:07:45] to have his feet on the ground. To have
[3:07:47] his feet on the ground to have his feet
[3:07:50] on the ground.
[3:07:52] He's trusting God.
[3:07:54] He's looking onto God. Then you will
[3:07:56] look at that one. He doesn't He say
[3:07:59] doesn't have future.
[3:08:03] You are calculating.
[3:08:06] You are calculating. You are
[3:08:08] calculating. You are using your eye.
[3:08:10] Your eye will fail you
[3:08:13] because Christian does not look by
[3:08:14] sight. You walk by faith.
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; That brother that say doesn't have
[3:08:22] future. Do you know what will happen to
[3:08:24] him 3 minutes from now?
[3:08:29] Many times it's a testing church. It's a
[3:08:33] testing.
[3:08:35] testing our little sisters because many
[3:08:38] of them today all their eyes
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; is on Tik Tok,
[3:08:43] Facebook,
[3:08:44] &gt;&gt; WhatsApp WhatsApp.
[3:08:46] [Music]
[3:08:48] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; Tik Tok will fail you. WhatsApp WhatsApp
[3:08:52] fail you WhatsApp
[3:08:55] you can never fail you.
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[3:09:03] Amen.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; God can never fail you.
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; So don't look at those we have been
[3:09:10] insulted.
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus.
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Brothers and sisters
[3:09:18] we came perverted
[3:09:21] and that is why God
[3:09:24] take it upon himself
[3:09:27] that is coming for our redemption.
[3:09:31] This is why when you look at the book of
[3:09:33] revelation chapter 5
[3:09:35] when that book Adam missed that book of
[3:09:37] life
[3:09:40] the thing went back to the hand of God
[3:09:44] and when they were calling who was
[3:09:46] worthy to come and look at the book
[3:09:49] nobody
[3:09:50] in heaven on earth beneath the sea
[3:09:54] nobody was that was why John cried
[3:09:58] because if nobody come that book.
[3:10:01] Humanity is lost.
[3:10:05] Names are written there,
[3:10:08] names are written and humanity is lost.
[3:10:12] This is why John was crying. When John
[3:10:15] was crying, he was crying. The one of
[3:10:18] the elders, he touching, he said, John
[3:10:21] weep not the lion of the tribe of Judah
[3:10:25] has prevailed to open the book. As John
[3:10:28] turned
[3:10:31] to look, he saw a bleeding lamb.
[3:10:34] He saw a bleeding shaking lamb. The lamb
[3:10:37] came and took the book. John said when
[3:10:41] he took the book, all the host of
[3:10:43] heaven, they bowed down for worship.
[3:10:48] Worthy, worthy is the lamb. Worthy,
[3:10:50] worthy is the lamb. Worthy, worthy. John
[3:10:52] said when that lamb took the book, he
[3:10:55] said creatures in heaven, creatures on
[3:10:58] earth the sea, they had me scream,
[3:11:02] there was a revival, there was a joy,
[3:11:06] there was a lamp
[3:11:09] to open the book and the Bible
[3:11:14] that has been open. That is why our
[3:11:17] names has been declared. Every time you
[3:11:21] see a minister behind the popping, he's
[3:11:23] calling names and I believe when you are
[3:11:26] a redeemed product and you hear your
[3:11:29] name, you will answer
[3:11:33] and I believe that's why we are here. So
[3:11:36] brothers and sisters, what am I telling
[3:11:38] you? We are the purchased possession
[3:11:42] of Jesus Christ. Therefore, God was made
[3:11:45] flesh to share his blood to claim you
[3:11:49] and me back to life because we are part
[3:11:53] of life, back to the world, back to
[3:11:57] light. We are not of darkness. We are of
[3:12:00] light. And the message of this hour has
[3:12:03] been vindicated to bring us back to life
[3:12:08] because he promised that at the evening
[3:12:11] time there shall be light
[3:12:14] and the message of the hour is the light
[3:12:16] of this hour. That is why when you
[3:12:19] receive it, you are quickening.
[3:12:24] He quicken you from darkness to light
[3:12:29] from death to life. That is why the
[3:12:32] Bible said, "He that heareth my word
[3:12:36] and believeth to he that sent me, he has
[3:12:39] eternal life.
[3:12:41] He shall not come to condemnation. He
[3:12:43] has passed from death
[3:12:46] to life. We are children of love. We are
[3:12:50] carrying the love of God and the love of
[3:12:52] God is the word of God.
[3:12:56] That's why I say my words by words
[3:12:59] their spirit and their life.
[3:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; This is the power
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; that is in us.
[3:13:07] This is the power that is in us. The
[3:13:09] power that is in us is the word of God.
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; And God is the most powerful. So when
[3:13:19] you have that word of God in you, you
[3:13:22] have God. And when you have God, you
[3:13:24] have the power of God.
[3:13:27] And there is nothing can conquer the
[3:13:28] power of God.
[3:13:31] Say we are more than conqueror.
[3:13:35] We are more than conqueror. Nothing can
[3:13:37] conquer. Flesh, Satan,
[3:13:41] word, unbelief.
[3:13:44] They under your feet because you are a
[3:13:47] conqueror.
[3:13:48] You walk over there. They're under your
[3:13:51] feet. They don't rule you. This is why
[3:13:54] Paul said, "Sin shall not have dominion
[3:13:56] over you."
[3:13:59] Because it has been conquered. And as
[3:14:01] you have received before God, you are
[3:14:04] walking over sin.
[3:14:06] Under your feet,
[3:14:08] under your feet. It's not by
[3:14:10] calculation.
[3:14:12] Under your feet.
[3:14:14] You above
[3:14:16] Satan.
[3:14:18] You're above unbelief above the world.
[3:14:22] Why? Because of the power that is in
[3:14:24] you. And that power is God himself.
[3:14:28] That's why he said, he that is in you is
[3:14:31] greater than he that is in the world.
[3:14:36] He said again, though I walk through the
[3:14:38] valley of shadow of death, I fear no
[3:14:41] evil because thou are with me.
[3:14:46] Though the world shake
[3:14:49] fear because God is in us.
[3:14:53] This is why signs,
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; science,
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; signs and wonders, miracles, they follow
[3:14:59] us. We don't run after them. They follow
[3:15:03] us. We are carrying the word.
[3:15:06] We are carrying the word.
[3:15:09] The word of God is with me. Signs and
[3:15:11] wonders are following me.
[3:15:13] The signs shall follow those that
[3:15:15] believe
[3:15:17] in my name, they shall cast a demon. So
[3:15:20] because of the power in you, demon
[3:15:23] cannot stand.
[3:15:25] When you stand before demon.
[3:15:29] Yes sir. Because of the power that is in
[3:15:31] you. And that power is the word of God.
[3:15:35] So brothers and sisters, are you here
[3:15:37] this afternoon? Have you received the
[3:15:39] power? Have you received the word? When
[3:15:42] you receive the word, you receive the
[3:15:44] power. Because when you have that word,
[3:15:47] you are full of power.
[3:15:52] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters,
[3:15:54] why we bow our heads? Think on this.
[3:15:57] What is in you?
[3:16:00] Is it the word of God?
[3:16:02] Because the word of God is living and
[3:16:04] powerful.
[3:16:09] Everything. Amen.
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; It's above everything
[3:16:12] or it is the cosmos system in you was in
[3:16:15] you. Something must be in you.
[3:16:18] You cannot be empty.
[3:16:21] Either you are full of religion or you
[3:16:23] are full of the word of God.
[3:16:25] Religion and the word of God are two
[3:16:28] different things.
[3:16:31] God did not come to give us religion. He
[3:16:34] comes to give us life and life is in the
[3:16:37] word.
[3:16:39] So as you think on those things,
[3:16:42] search yourself. What is in you? Is it
[3:16:45] the word of God or is it cosmos?
[3:16:50] Talk to God
[3:16:52] in your own way.
[3:16:55] Search yourself.
[3:16:57] There's a song say
[3:17:00] me.
[3:17:03] &gt;&gt; I know my thoughts today in number 16.

[3:39:55] There is power,
[3:39:58] power
[3:40:00] and working power in the preious
[3:40:05] blood over the Lord.
