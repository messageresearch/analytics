dear Lord [Music] [Applause] there e e e e e e e sitation that I suffered from but the Lord is so good that I'm alive up to now and I I was involved in business at that time and I was buying produce and something interesting happened there was a man who came at the shop I had at the center and he says uh I've got a track of uh maze will you buy it I said yeah then he says I've got also [Music] soybeans and it's a track and I've got beans also he says will you buy them I said yeah I will he says you see I'm coming here he said these things are getting here by 7 in the morning L did I know he was trying to Su out of me the knowledge whether I had money in the house did I know the man was a robber so what happened I traveled to Ginger to get money out of the bank and then I traveled back home and they were traing my movement and then later on something pulled me and I came back to Ginger so I did not spend the night at home and that night the robbers came so we were staying together my brother's house as you understand the homee my father's house there and then we're just on those uh uh you know guest Wing at the back so they came with guns and my father had gun my brother had a gun but little did they know they only knew of my father so they stood at the back and the front they begin to shoot come out if you are a man then my brother in his house he escaped and they came direct to my place where I used to stay so I was not there they ask my wife where is he then she says it's not here they looked all over the house and I was not there so they took my wife to my brother's house and say we want you to show us where your uh brother-in-law stay the room direct so she took them when they entered in there they said lot of precious things and as they were trying to grab them my wife escaped and So eventually afterwards they started asking where is she where is she they couldn't see her that's now the time when they were trying to open up the cars to load everything they they had taken and run away with it and back in my place they had roded one of the mattresses and rolled and peace was roded in that mattress and she was just a little kid I think about three four years I mean months and she was rode in there so in the fight my father my brother sent them some fire they also returned then my brother continued and it was was not easy for them to run with end of the C and that way peace survive she couldn't be loaded on [Applause] the you see we need to remember the good things that the Lord does for us you know uh sometimes to get to this level let me tell you another interesting thing my mother-in-law was working as a nurse and she had had a night Duty she had worked in the night and so somebody came C and she was not responding and then a child comes out and said mama is not in okay tell her that her daughter were attacked by robbers last night she jumped out of the house what happened so sometimes we forget certain things that we should give thanks to God for amen and then after a few years we moved and settled in Tor and in t July of 1985 the government of of fell it was a very difficult time they DEC the and now when they declar the you couldn't get out of the house by seven so that same night soldiers came rounded up the house and they got in the house they told me get out I got out they said let's go I said I'm not going anywhere and I remained right there I began calling upon the Lord and I prayed they were inside there collecting everything they could lay and now this man here just wanted to shoot me and I said Lord I give my life to you ruling the Affairs of men here got convicted R back his gun on the shoulder he was commanding that troop he ENT into the house and told them everything you've touched in that house leave it there leave it there so they dropped everything came out they told me go back in and at that time my wife was pregnant expecting patience so the following day I told her not to stay in that place I told her to go back in the village and I stayed alone after one week I wanted to go and check on them I'm giving you the history here so when I went to check on them there is a brother he was just a secondary school student then I left him in charge of the house and so you could go to his father they could get the lunch then comes back to keep the house but before 7 in the evening the rain came so heavily it was too much rain and eventually he failed to come back and that night everything I had in the house was stolen that's how I I decided to come down to Ginger I came when I had nothing and I rented the 10 by 10 room and that's where brother you know we started the church from when God is moving and moving you he can allow anything he allowed persecution upon the disciples in Jerusalem and when they were scattered abroad then the gospel began to spread sometimes there is a lot of good light in bad things and sometimes you realize it much later and when I came I had totally nothing but then I had a call upon my heart aing to the dream which brother had that my call is in ginger and when I came I didn't have a job I didn't have anything but I want to give thanks to God for the man called God free m right behind there every week he fed my house for a number of years he could ride a bicycle bring food and I want to say God bless you [Applause] brother God bless you so much amen and you know when we came down here we tried to get out of that 10 by 10 and we were about five people we got school on Grant Road Ro up there and then when we went to that school the only came when they saw we were five people they told us not to come again next week we moved from 1986 to 1992 we moved in six different places we try to stay a little more in school in ganization came and rented the hle and they promised to paint it P the libr and then they demanded they don't want any other group in that school they told us to leave so we went down to the house of brother and then from there we went to W East Primary School school and then we were there for quite some time there is a lady MRSA who is the mother of the Manda boys B and the rest of them the head mistress there she gave us a place and we really were happy but several years I think two or so when she got transferred a Muslim head teacher came and when the school closed for Holiday all the seats and everything were locked out and we were sent out but you see God is good when we were being sent out Brother David had become the deputy head teacher of Main Street primary school stre schol I don't know Brother David is here right there God bless you Brother David also [Applause] and we stayed there up to 1992 and it is 33 years since then the gospel has been sweet and very you know been missionary minded and I remember the trip to I don't know brother Nas are you here brother is there and you know going into those areas at the time you had to get worried because you had to go through the game and was there and I always feared the water so I could not go through Lake so I prayed and so we decided to drive and go and we came through the G as we were coming to the end we came to a bridge and you know it was eroded on one side on the other side and there was some kind of a a hill like in the middle of the RO and normally when you are driving you would put one of the tires on that protruded position which had been you know surviv but all of a sudden there were people standing in front of us and talk about the scare we thought we had gone into the ambush of people and while I was looking at them little did I see that spot so my tire was here and here and under there was a raised spot and the car was hit it went up like a plane and came down the dust was too much I don't remember who else was with me on that trip I don't remember do you remember who no but brother was there so we drove for over 100 km after that to the place that's where you were going to have meetings so when we go to the place I told Brother take the car to the garage he dro the car and when he got to the gate of the garage he told the man what the problem was and the man came to drive the car when he came the car was not moving and he says how did you drive this car here he says I just drove it but the ti ends which hold the tires it was broken but the car went for over 100 km that is [Applause] God praise the Lord you see you know you remember a few things and then you start wondering why did the Lord allow me to live up to this spot I was supposed to go to West again and I want tell you that I prayed the whole night I fear the G because of Co and then I fear the water I could not go on the boat finally I decided let me go by the boat it was I and brother and we drove we went up to to get on the boat we left the car at the police station and you know it was very late when we got the boat to take us across the lake and what happened is that they loaded the boat and the boat was so full so we began to sail and it was getting dark eventually we go to a place and the engine and the storm started coming on the sea the water was coming in it was already getting dark so some the man one of the men stood at the head of the Bo and he was trying to wave a white cloth vure somebody will see us but it was getting dark so we decided to pray the water would fall in into the boat when they tried to SCP it out it was not possible because there were so many feet of the people at the bottom of the of the boat so there was more water coming in what could be scooped out we decided with brothera let us pray when we prayed another boat came and the boat which came it was Fisherman's Boat who had laid their next there and our boat went into that spot and Tangled itself with the boat I mean with the the net and the engine stopped [Music] were very heavy guy and they were saying we are going to drop your Bo in the water we prayed they negotiated for money they gave them the money they put they put a rope and they took us across the gospel sometimes is bleeding with blood [Music] sometimes when people saw successful work they desire to head it but they don't know where you came from with it I remember when I was with my wife and brother were moving from and it was night we from one meeting going to another and there was a man who was carrying heavy and I was sympathetic with him it was as large as an electric Paul would be and when I said let look at this man who is really laboring with this law little did I know he was a robber that l in the RO up to now we cannot tell how how drove over it it happened God is always good and I really thank God there are so many things that we have come through in the bringing forth of this message to the people and once in a while I'll be sharing some of those testimonies but God is good amen praise the Lord God is good so I want us to stand up and get into the scripture reading Psalms chapter [Music] 23 and verse one it's says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want precious Heavenly Father we want to give thanks to you for the grace that has gathered us in your presence today I trust that you present and father that you are going to speak to us we dedicate and Commit This service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated so today I have a title the holding gift to hold and not let go the holding gift amen but before we get there I want to do one thing and uh pray uh for the people that support a service I'm talking about the song leaders and then the interpreters we shall pray for them amen now he says here in the message Paradox of Chicago in 1963 he says it makes me feel good to hear good singing and then he says and I go in the office down there and he constantly got them tapes of singing going all the time and I think his kind of helps him amen it's good listening to Christian music it has got a message it has got some form of consolation so he says you know there's something about s that's got power in it we all know we are aware of that just look at the Amy when they sing the songs and play the music do you know the approach to war in the arm of God is first by music the singers went before the Earth rejoicing and singing then come the AR the battle that's the right approach amen so he has told us music is a blessing to the soul because it speaks to your soul and he has told us even when the arm is going to B they [Music] go yeah theying fire and so they sing and he says even in the the coming in of the Ark it was music that brought in the ark are you together with me okay then he says in another quote in the same message and that's the reason we come in the service at night what do we do sing the HM of the Lord and then the Y the word we read the word and the battle amen so the great burners are flying tonight the name of Jesus Christ the Lord God may be exalted the enemy to be put to flight amen that's why we sing praise God Amen you go singing and praising going into battle and that's exactly what happen when the Ark of David was coming in he prepared the singers who went before and they s and even David before that he also used to see and now Saul who was always burdened in his heart when he walked into that singing he was released I don't know but let me tell you one of the reasons why you fail to step into the atmosphere of the service is simply because you have missed the song service when you miss the song service it becomes very difficult for you to get into the inspiration to catch and understand what the minister is trying to talk about you need to come and relieve yourself and get into the right atmosphere that when you see and you hear other things when the spirits to you they are put to flight that's why musicians must do a good job must do a good job amen you need to pray when you are coming in to do the song service because you are the one who sets the atmosphere right amen when you come and you totally fail it's a problem you don't just come down here to sing whatever comes in your mind because we expect you to pray for your service and as you pray for your Serv something happens but the Lord himself by Grace puts you into the same range of [Music] Mind amen of the message which is going to be preached and then you think about the songs you write down the songs you want you make a not amen because it's a service and then you from this song I'm going to this song this song Here talks about Victory we are going to sing Victory in Jesus talk about men in battle how they went in talk about David when he went in and what a joy it was praise the Lord stand up all of us let us sing Victory in Jesus so the song leader is already putting you into the inspiration into the direction of the spirit praise the Lord amen you see you don't just come to read songs let me sing this and then that and then this you are leading the people into worship into recognizing the goodness of God in the love of God praise God Amen so before I go down to pray for all the people leaders and interpreters we didn't dedicate them last Sunday but we are going to do it this day you see we just want to bring one example the example that I want us to go into is second chronicles 5 the dedication of Solomon's Temple amen you see song leaders are an integral part of the service are you together with me they an integral part of the service amen they either kill the service or they give it life so you know they need to be [Music] skilled I've always spoken about that the musicians the men who play things you know your ministry as musicians is different from the preacher Ministry the preacher does it alone but the musicians you are a team if one plays [Music] being there is a be and another [Music] place you confuse the song leader and if the song asks for and then he begins to sing with d he confuses the so you are a team so you must learn what to do as a team you must find time to be here and train to put the service right amen yes sir so [Music] listen also the Levites which were the singers all of them of Assa of hon of Judi with their sons and their beinged in white linen having symbols andies and hearts stood at the East End of the and with them 120 priests around sounding with trumpets now listen at the turn of events and it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one they are not playing out of key but the singers and the trumpeters as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord they when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of Music uh and praise the Lord say for his good for his must end forever the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord what brought the cloud down the Joshua Ministry Moses mes Cal if they are here singing and they agree with the musicians God dwells in the Praises of his people the cloud came down so they make the service and the scripture says so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled in the house of God praise the Lord the ministers they could not stand to minister that's the kind of service I want that the song service has been so anointed and that the presence of the Lord has come down I do not have position to stand at theit that the Lord himself takes over the ministry of the world ministering Bey me that's what we are looking for and that's what I want to dedicate the song leaders for and even these men here to come in the same spirit that we may always praise the Lord amen and we have them here and we are going to have a word of prayer praise the Lord do you love him let's dedicate them to the Lord praise the lord we are going to do it a little different hold your hands one to another just like the Chim did because because they are to fly together precious heavenly father I thank you for these young men that you have called lord to do the work of the ministry I want to dedicate them to you for the particular service called them bless them in a special way father for those who are the instrumentalist Lord give them wisdom and those who sing Lord give them the grace that they may blend together pray Lord Jesus that these men as they father go ahead of the service you may anoint them specifically Lord that when they do their work The Cloud of Glory always come down to release the people from Spirits of depression and oppression Lord give them Grace that they be a blessing to the people have committed them dedicated for service in Jesus name [Applause] amen praise the Lord so here we go into the teaching of the word the holding gift Psalms 23 so I take you down here first to the Book of Amos 3 verse 11 I want to have about one hour one and half I pray that the Lord May bless interpret also in Jesus name amen God bless you so Amos 3 therefore thus says the Lord God anary there shall be even around about the land shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled and thus says the Lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth ofie so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samar in the cor of a bed and inas in the court an adversary the Lord says shall be around the land and it shall bring down thy strength amen so I want you friends to learn one thing that the devil will always be the devil he cannot retire from what he is the scripture here is talking about the enemy the adversary surrounding Israel so that he can weaken the nation he can weaken the church I don't want you to go weak amen try to come up time the enemy tries to punch you amen try to rise back there is a brother in one of the churches amen he was son of a pastor and then when the father died he went to drink it but then he spoke about the grace of God because each time yeah that is in such and such a he would walk in to go and bring him out he had a good job he had good money and then he would hear again in that he still go and bring him and he would tell him repent and now when he told him that he says but why because I'll do it tomorrow and brother says I will not get tired of trying to get you back each time you st that's the shepher he doesn't give up on anybody he kept redeeming that finally one of the best preachers in Church [Applause] praise the Lord that's what God does he says that the adversary count to surround your house to surround you to surround the church but God is determined to deliver you from the hold of the enemy amen so now Psalms 23 verse1 he says the Lord is my shepher shall not so David compressed all the attributes of God together amen so you know he says of all those attributes he lamped them together and called it the Lord amen the Lord is referring to him by all the attributes amen and so he invokes all those seven attributes he invokes all those seven Redemptive names and sums them up together amen so you know this is very interesting because God appear to the is in seven different Hard Times by a different Redemptive name amen he appear to the people in seven different [Music] names in which he hid his power to redeem amen so his attitude towards the people from Eden back Eden is wrapped in the seven Redemptive names the first one being Jehovah which means the Lord will provide a sacrifice the second one is Jehovah Rafa the Lord the Healer oure the Lord is pres so seven different names am when he wants to provide he would hide under a certain attribute under a different title so we serve a God who identif himself in many different attributes and so taking different titles now God is not a theological ideology amen is eternal reality which unfors himself through substantiating the word amen he's God because he makes his word a Living Word are you together with me that's what makes him go yes sir when he says let there be light there is light when he says be healed in my name he'll get healed that's what makes him God because his word life amen he manifest as king to the messan kingdom where the nation of Israel was a mod Kingdom judge another time as a priest and he takes the titles to underline the different attributes amen even when Israel was approaching God In [Music] Worship they knew what title to invoke amen praise the Lord they knew what to we must know what title to invoke when we need God amen God has a way of approach amen you know if you are going to visit a king there is a way you approach a king totally different from a Jud amen you are going to you don't just go any and you are so you know you have to approach him in a way you don't call him William there is a way to approach there is a way to approach and so we look at it in Matthew 9 there came a ruler and worshiped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and let hand upon her and she shall leave he now headed to God and lay hand to raise the sick God along the way he met a woman with a blood issue for 12 years who touched the H of His Garment and she was healed instantly so he finally go to the ruler's house where he found the dead and took her by the hand and the M came back to life are you together with me and the flame went br as he continued on the journey then he found two Blind Men followed him crying and saying th son of David have Merc on us th son of David have mercy on us he asked them believe ye that I am able to do this and when he asked they answered in the affirmative he touched their eyes and healed them then he continued going further in Matthew 15 a woman of Canan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mer on me oh th son of David my daughter is vexed grievously with the devil she is the woman of Canan and she's crying the same Cry The Blind Men were crying son of David and healed them amen but now when this woman was crying he said that to her it's not right to take children's bread C it to dog why she had the wrong approach she was not a Jew she had no right to call him son of David are you together with me yeah and then she said that oh even dogs would eat the C are you together with me when she came into the right perspective when she had come out of the approach which the Jews would do and says I'm not part of that but I still need Grace then he says I've never seen such a faith in Israel are you together with me God requires the right approach and you'll get whatever you want amen so we need to learn how to approach a redeeming shepher amen we want to look at God who has the Fallen World before him and then what for approach we would use to approach him amen now I want you to listen to this that to redeem the elect out of the Fallen worldto himself he needed to himself into Sai a Savi of his own creation amen he had to take totally different from that of Creator and from that of a judge are you together with me heed himself into different the attribute of a priest amen Redeemer the one who takes away the SS of the people are you together with me praise God listen here what the prophet says he says Heavenly Father take us now Lord let the great shepher the great redeeming Shepherd the great Shepherd who left the glory knowing that some of the attributes was lost on them great vales of SE where the woles animals would soon div the little sheep but he left the golden Corridor came down into the Earth and was made one of us he could declare the love of God to us I found them some of them in denominations some of them in the house of illame some of them on streets blind some of them in the hges ands but he redeemed everyone that the fathered him to redeem he redeemed everyone so he took the attribute this time not the attribute of a judge sir but the attribute of a redeemer he created himself a body of sacrifice amen so he had made himself of no reputation he taken upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men amen are you together with me he was now a and therefore the approach had changed is the approach of have upon me Lord are you together with me that's the approach now he came with did not come as the great consuming fire amen he did not come as a great judge he came as God the servant to serve humanity and redeem Humanity so the approach had Chang in the book of Hebrews 2 verse4 he says for as much then as the children partakers of Flesh and Blood also likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him the power of death that's the devil are you together with me yes sir because the devil [Applause] amen the nature of sin into humanity and so he says I'm going to go in the same body flesh and blood in the same nature in which the devil tments people came under the same so that the devil could not see God see a man because he was a man who had come to come through the same situation of suffering and pain so that he can redeem those that were under that form of captivity so he came under another title complet so to become a redeeming shepher he needed to become a kman and in this light we need to take a look into the sheph anointing a little bit because in there there is a great miracle that I want you to see amen he had to come Among Us he had to leave the corridors of Glory he are to be born of a woman amen come through all the pained of the devil but then he never because God was buil under that body so he comes to so that he can bring us in the same form that we also can be redeemed and overcome the nature of sin that's my prayer amen so we know that all of us there is a part of God in you a SE on the side of you and that's what God was looking for when he came down here on Earth when he says God so loved the world he's not talking about the cosmos [Music] is talking about you that had the nature of God in you that's what God was looking for amen so we know that we are fitted with the part of God which is a seed Gene of life and these seed jeans have in them the power of transformation that will finally Express the person of God that you are amen yeah because when the Holy Spirit comes and touches that [Music] c and gives it the revelation of the new birth in that seed they power of transformation which helps that seed to grow into the image of what God wanted that se amen so and then the nature in that seed which is similar to a particular character of God that's what your inheritance is because you have got a god is so many attributes I will give you the easy God is a pastor God is an evangelist God is anost he gets a little bit of that and drops it in you and then you are not aware you are just as seen as anybody else but the Holy Ghost comes and I mean brings the light toward this and the Darkness clears and the Holy Ghost Waters that seed and when that seed begins to grow it grows towards the nature that God put on the side of if God wanted the prayer that se does not grow towards prophet it grows into what God wants you to be amen so God Waters the seed that's the seed that he comes to and that's the seed comes to P are you together with me so a pastor is given seed je to p and the food given for those je it's only the je that will be able to understand what God wants them to be amen so that nature that is similar to a particular character of God and I want to say that that character is your inheritance you inherit on what God is praise the lord we cannot be the same but whatever you are is a part of God that is your [Applause] inheritance amen praise the Lord so this process happened in the life of David has happen in every born amen let me tell you I preached here and I told you we are born predestinated to the adoption of son I told you that I as a human when I receive a child I plan his inheritance but God is not like me when I was born in the kingdom of God I was born to inherit my inheritance was there it was waiting for that's the same with you you inheritance in the Kingdom amen so we are all different in our areas of inheritance much as we could be in the same calling we are you know I want say we are different and you are the only you amen there could be so many apostles in the history of the church and you also could be an apost but then you are the only kind of CH praise God you could be a business are the only type of business there has never been one like you they will never be one like when God chooses a pastor like we have brother James here he's the only who he is hallelujah hallelujah not be judged by me amen he a p God has called and when the changing needs of the church change amen God needs a man to F the needs of that time praise the Lord amen when he takes you a lot deeper that's what we needed amen when he comes with a ping FL Amen to clean the Flor amen that's what we need amen because every G is a part of God that it is so original canot be any other like so you only you from the foundation of the Amen in Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before in love so he chose [Music] before the foundation of fit in a certain spot amen that's why my wife is my wife and not another man's wife she came to fit in the right spot and for 45 years it has to be the right spot amen he has chosen you amen for a particular purpose to be the [Music] habitation of the Holy Ghost to manifest himself in a certain way so you become a Holy Mountain amen you become the habitation of the Holy Spirit praise God so we grow to the level where he trusts us and makes us the living house of the Living God hallelujah hallelujah you don't beg for it you just present [Music] yourself to the process of divine grace are you together with me a process of divine grace you don't come and say Lord give me also make me an apostle me also make me that no just present yourself to the redeeming process justification sanctification B of the ho ghost then he will guide you what you have to be you were born a predestinated seity amen you cannot take another man's place and no man can take your place you were born a predestinated SE five having predestinated us the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen not my will you but his will over you is the will of God that you are what you are that I am what I am amen so now we are dealing with uhms 23 David the redeeming shepher gift he did not put himself there bless amen a redeeming sheer gift why is he because the the gene on the [Music] inside was that of the shepher amen the of Moses Joshua that a je of David the musician not David the king not David the priest are you together with me because David played all those attributes praise God so th now God anoints the Jeep he does not anoint what you desire to be so in you could be the Gen of an evangelist be a teaching could be a to show Mery could be a of Amen an anointed musician are you together with me praise God brother Bram says well is now trying to put himself in the uh position where somebody is talking to him well brother Bram I wasn't called to be a preacher you might be called to be a housewife you got your position in Christ by the Holy Ghost you are just as much David as the rest of them was are you together with me yeah you could be a mechanic and you are so much also D in that position amen hallelujah hallelujah he says if you are a housewife remain a housewife whatever God called you to do just remain there he knows where to put his hand on you use you he had a little woman named Han amen one time little housewife he know where to place her what he was going to do with he amen that's God just come through the process justification Sanic of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost to do what he wants to praise the Lord [Music] every has a specific operation in the body and always blend with operations to make a working body like the El be here Amen to make a functioning body the leg had to be where it is to make a functioning body but all these are controlled by the intelligence which is the Mind hallelujah hallelujah so the mind tells you to [Music] eat the goes for the food so we are all under one mind which is the mind of Christ that's what brings us together and then every joint begins to supply amen for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ one member of another amen David had the anointing of a shepher are you together with me he a sheep like all the others but anointed by what Peter called the chief sheer so now when the Holy Spirit comes to anoint person he goes and puts all the potential Amen in that se so that the SE can grow into what God wanted you to see you don't fight you just submit yourself amen listen now that Chief pul David to the back side of the desert and there he was fighting lions and bears why he was trying to grow the to protect the ship he was trained in how to suffer with the Sheep hallelujah hallelujah and you know David he would just come into the people and they there must be a shepher around here he smelled like sheep and he spoke like sheep my sheep hear my voice hallelujah hallelujah and when he would pass around they feel the saint of the shepher they know that the man who has got a character and the nature to lead us to Green Pastures Amen to Ste Waters rest us when we fall is a holding gift hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord so this is the quality of shepher a man that goes into the field in the field f with the suffering together rejoicing together delivering them he's not hiring he's not a lord over the ship amen but is a he walks ahead of the sheep against G in confidence hallelujah what did he go out there for in the battle he had gone to tell the nation of Israel that I have qualified hallelujah hallelujah and then he stepped out and he says who is this circumcised amen and all Israel was behind it was the Sheep he was the shepher going ahead to bring down the wolf are you together with me yeah he was anointed amen could not do it as he was the elder brother of hallelujah hallelujah but the Gen inav anointed amen praise the Lord now to the shepher God will speak to him different from the rest of the flock he's assigned amen the security of the flock and all his meditation is about the welfare of the hallelujah hallelujah the shepher he looks into the FL and is to tell which one is sick which one is hungry which one is hry amen there's no way God would address the need of the flock amen from another ship no he has a shepher and we thank God that we've got a shepher Among Us so in emter one and verse one there is a secret he says in verse one the words of Amos who was among the hearts of which he saw concerning isra in the days of King in the days of job the son of Jo king of Israel two years before the earthquake about the general welfare of the ship he talks to the are you together with me now Amos was a prophet but he was also a shepher and when God begins to talk to Amos he talks to him in the language of a shepher are you together with me so about the welfare of a congregation he talks to a amen the Evangel you just cry every day that's the Evangelist he talk about everything new a teacher could be letter without compassion could be straight jacketing is concerned with more Church order straight jacketing you didn't stand right you didn't sit right you didn't you didn't dress right but the pastor he knows how to handle all those concerns you see many times we try to take over the roles of a shepher this one is criticizing this one's child and that one criticizes the other one's child and then but the way you're doing it is not the way I know you've got aert but go on your knees sometimes our children are so young that we don't see any problem but when they grow you learn to say God forgive me I didn't know raising up those big women it has been the grace of God pastor's children and people were doing all kinds saying all kinds of things he's always the pastor's child who not dressing right who's not having a long dress enough who's not having good dress this but we thank God we made it praise the Lord amen so you know God spoke to the shepherd a prophet Amos he wasman of and God when he was speaking to him about Israel he spoke to him in the ship language are you together with me yeah the same way the king when is speaking to him speaking to God he uses the Sheep language are you together with me you get a Deon amen and his may be was toon the church and he be always T he always want you to be in life brother William are you together with me but then when God calls a man like that and puts him in the pet to P the people changes he's a holding gift and so when God was a man like David he was a shepher he's always talking about the Lord is my sheer hallelujah hallelujah because he's looking at his over which he was a shepher as she and he looks at them and he has sympathy and compassion over them because himself also has been sheep before he understands the problem of she he understands that the ship can stay but the anointing upon the SE is not let that seed go forever amen praise the Lord so he spoke to Amos a shephered prophet of t using the shepher language to speak to Israel Amos 3: 11 amen he says therefore th says the Lord God anary there shall be even the land and it shall bring down thy strength the and thy palaces shall be sped and th says the Lord hallelujah hallelujah he talking to him as a shepher he talks to him in sheep language and he says that the shepher taketh of the mouth out of the mouth of the lion two legs a p of so shall the children of Israel taken out that dwell in Samaria in the cor of the bed and in Damascus in the cour hallelujah hallelujah so God anoints shepher SE a for the Sheep hallelujah hallelujah David went and killed a liar because it was tampering with the Sheep are you together with me sometimes you have to forgive James whens like a defending shepher are you together with me he will not sit and watch the f e the understanding of Aer is that if I redeem the ear maybe the Sheep will grow back from that piece of Hallelujah Hallelujah if it's a piece of leg maybe it will grow back from that piece of the leg that's the understanding of a sh hallelujah hallelujah you always need to understand when he goes back and brings another brother you people wouldn't want to be in your mid that one understand the shepherd He will go for him and bring him down even if the only sance of a sheep the piece of [Music] an amen he bring him bring him back amen yes sir that's the compassion amen and attachment of value that the shepher has to the Sheep amen he values the sh and as a man doing what is Anointed to do sometimes it may look so easy because the man ISO for David was anointed for the job that's why he walked out against gbody else can do it if God has to talk about the church he's going to use our [Applause] sheer don't you think that you also can be a voice it's not that easy David make the work Look So Easy his [Music] son thought he could do it better than him when you find an anointed Pastor stay under that anointing the shepher is a gift driven by compassion toward the general Ware of the Sheep amen okay let's go to John 172 amen do you love him yes sir he says while I was with them in the world now this is the chief shepher he says while I was them in the world I kept them in thy name I kept them under your character [Music] those that thou Gest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son oftion that the scripture might be fulfilled those who you gave me I've L is a holding gift Amen to keep you in the amen he knows you are dirty but he'll keeping you but within the F amen the shepher uses his name which means the name of the Lord meaning the character of the word to keep the ship clean to keep the ship together he understand the strength and the weakness of the ship and I want you to know that you are a ship with a tender nature and always prone to getting lost that's the shepherd easy to get lost you don't know how God deals with the local church every local church God has given a for them but then you want to go to another church which has got another and bring it here that's not the way God works look at the seven churches that and was the chief Shepherd among them but all of them were different from one another works we don't put a weight on a pastor God speaks to him about the local church because your sheep your nature is easily exploited by the Gods which Moses called the mixed crowd come in here and they can easily confuse that's the problem of sh that man is lying to you that is ship Isaiah 53:6 all we like sheep have we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him theity of now this is the chief shepher he is saying he's looking at sheep and he says they've gone astray everyone has turned to his own way amen that's sh and he says the burden has been put upon the sheer to go and look for them sheep has a tend to scatter if she doesn't keep the eye on the shepherd because the nature and character of sheep is to follow my sheep hear my voice and a stranger will they not follow so that's the attribute of Christ to the entire church body but then that attribute has been [Music] distributed to the different people that are being anointed to be pastors they walk ahead of the God help me to be and keep my eye on the ministry of the shepherd God has given a local church I want to be like elishah he did not take his eye away from the she he kept watching theer amen when he needed a gift to be like elij El told him keep your eye on me years he had the eye on the sheer amen hallelujah hallelujah never listen to [Music] criticize listen to Fe amen listen to Fe not to criticize for8 years Elisha had ideas but whenever brought an idea elah was not B him he was telling him go away what have I done after God is not giving us a bing Pastor God is giving us a pastor to feed us with the word Hold Us Together by the word that's what God is doing sheep need to realize that without a shepher they are God now the people but the Lord is my shepher yes but he has anointed thater anointing upon hold the people together in the word amen yes sir so there's you know the moment you allow your FL let me put it this way that God loves us to remain babies in Christ to remain LS because even in all the religious sacrifices it was lamps that were used we need to keep ourselves as humble as that way we shall not turn to our own ways we shall always be in line with the word and the anointing that the Lord has given the local church are you together with me so the moment you allow your FL to graduate to sh then you'll be in trouble I prefer to remain L you know sheep a sence and now brother James you got a responsibility to teach these people in such a way that they always maintain the lamp attitude amen you know just remind them when the Lambs lose their supposed innocence and tend to live like sheep they certainly begin to Str they stray into self-imposed postures into self-imposed postures they go their own pastures I don't want that one I want this one that's not she are you happy that you amen they begin to feed on her grass amen which has no moisture and they develop spiritual constipation amen becomes a problem hallelujah hallelujah but the shepher knows where to lead the ship amen but then when they tend to develop you know their own mind they develop this Doctrine thinking that complicating amen the simplest of this message they think that's the depth in the word is to catch that [Music] door with Christ because to know him is life eternal amen so God has instructed the holding gift to hold the ship together and also feed them feed my LS maintain the status of Ls feed my sheep by reminding them of the simple understanding of Christ and once they come back to where they fell from you reced L praise the Lord [Music] amen he paid the Deb of sin at Cal and that was all that you needed to be free free from anything that will inflate you from the simplest of Christ Redemption was paid for but between Calvary and now doing the work of intercession a work to get the character to match with our person the amen that it produces the nature of Christ and help us to live that nature so before I finish I want us to drop down into Psalms 23 you know he spread himself out in the church that's now the shepher by A fivefold Min first the apostles second the prophets evangelist pastors and teachers but all those gifts there is only one holding gift the pastor who feeds the Sheep by teaching them so he must be a teaching Pastor amen when they get the people from the field they pour them for the past the P gets Apostles out of them he gets he gets pastors out of them he teachers out of them that's now the shepher Psalms 23 listen very well David is not depending on Jus but depending on he that described himself as the good shepher hallelujah hallelujah who receives the ship and washes the ship and out of them makes them different gifts so Psalms 23 defs the submission of the Lamb that trust the eternal [Applause] security in the chief shepher they are walk behind the chief shepher the one who knows where the security is he knows where the Still Waters are he knows where the Green Pastures are and he was speaking about himself in John and verse one he says very verily I say unto you he that ENT not by the door into the ship fold but clim up some other way the same is the thief and Robber now here he's not talking about you entering into Christ no he talking about a man who would want something to do with so now here we are now talking about a sheer a sheer first by himself must have entered by the door ship fell to reach the ship he must be born again he must be in Christ in order to be able the amen he says but he that enter by the door is the shepher of the ship so it's not talking about the New Birth he's talking about a man who is Anointed to be a shepher he passes through the door and it's the same thing with you remember he says behold I stand at the door and to light the sheer are you together with me so when God gives us a shepher we must not keep our doors closed we must open those doors because he has already come through Christ he has been anointed he has been given a gift and that gift is to deal with you to help you to keep you in the ship are holding gift he says to him the port [Music] open and the ship hear his voice and he call his own ship by name them out you see the ministry of a shepher is not mechanical it's not much read much as [Music] necessary it's not being so much prayerful but yet is [Music] necessary but it is presenting your the Lord as a shepherd and after You' presented your soul you have gone through the door then the shepher himself begins to trade you on how to deal with this ship ship is a very complicated animal you remember when I to on ship here one time and I showed you how ship when it goes mad it's mad when they fight they really fight and only the shepher that will be able to understand that true these are sheep but they are crossing a certain line is the burden bear is the one who standing when the ship begin to fight that's the shepher so in Ephesians 4:7 and every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ hallelujah hallelujah you are given a certain measure of Grace according to the gift of Christ so the ministry of this pastor operates certain meure Hallelujah Hallelujah you cannot compare this [Applause] one are different measures and the need of that local church is different from the need of this church so we cannot put them in the same basket and begin to judge them amen that's why on the day of reconing amen what is going to happen is that God is only going to reward the faithfulness of the minister not how many people no but how faithful to the five that God had given is not going to compare him to another brother who has 1000 God doesn't work like that he gives gifts according to the measure of Grace Amen in Matthew 253 amen now this is the the one who was given five and the one who was given two the reward was the [Music] same the reward is faithfulness he says well done good and faithful servant has been Faithful over a few things the one who was five he was faithful in and one had two he was also faithful in the few so whatever me we have been as blessed with is just a few things but what stands [Applause] out is character and service good and faithful even to the one of two good and Faith the character of the seed G amen am praise the Lord so a shepher operates with a greater measure of Grace people these other gifts he not simply teach of doctr he not just a head of people the ministry of the sheer is Christ building character his children amen so therefore Psalms 23 reveals how God can safely manage the Sheep navigating them through the valley of the Shadows of death and bringing them over into safety so Psalms 23 reveals the nature of sheep sometimes which stay and the Sheep nature as well as it you know has a way to go astray there is still a nature in it that still complies with the voice of God are you together with yeah he may stay but then still he has God the ability to listen to hear the voice of God she hear my [Music] voice and when they hear the voice he has the ability to rest them some people would say let that R go but God doesn't do that he knows my sheep here will come he keeps calling and then he sometimes get faint he has faint and the voice grows bigger and grows bigger and he says Ah that's the voice of the master are you together with me that's the voice of the master that can be restored amen look at God dealing with the Sheep 232 he makes me to lie down in green pasture it does the ship doesn't say I lie in the green pasture but he makes me to laugh deci that a much as it canay it can he The Voice come backto me amen praise the Lord that can be in verse three he Resto my soul he Le me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake that can be restored people under this holding Ministry understand the nature of Sheep amen and we operate with the sheep on a level of Grace that's how difficult a shepher Ministry is when he comes to you bu a shepher always comes by Grace he comes because he loves amen let's take this Old Testament analogy in Hebrews chter 5 verse one so that we can be able to relate the priesthood amen and the ministry of the shepherd Forever high priest taken from among men is ordained for many things pering to God that may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin so he understands the nature of men he understands the internal fights that they have a man is called from a man that's a shepher that's a priest he has been called a man from am and isain men for men in things pertaining to God to reconcile men back to God because he a man he understands their failure he understands their wickedness what has happened is that the Holy Spirit came down and awakened his which had the character of the and then anointed it through to come into the level of Christ the high priest who stands between the people and their [Applause] judgment and that's what we have suffer and verse three says he can have [Applause] compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way so the Old Testament priest gives us an inight on what the ministry of Christ the high priest is and that Ministry works now in the image of a shepher reconciling reconciling reconciling we know what he does ignorant he teaches them those who are out of the way reconciles them that's a shepher so in doing his ministry the Old Testament priest required compassion dealing with ignorance that out of he is our shadow for the she so the local pastor we deal with all the weaknesses and failures to build the character amen are you going to work with him amen as he works with your families works with you you know he's a burden bear when he comes to your house don't he there because Hees amen you are his ministry without you he has no Ministry Amen Let me close with this but you see in Church there's the pastor and that Pastor is a special Pastor he's built where he can put up with the forces of the people a burden Bearer is the ox of the team he's the man that can sit down when somebody has got something against another and sit with them two families and rason it out and bring it back right in a pastor he knows how to take care of are you together with me is instructed not to lose any sheep I have lost none a Shepherd is a in Ministry so we thank God that he has given us a pastor that I believe will be able to understand the conditions of the eror and be able to drive the church God bless you God [Applause] bless praise the Lord amen amen if you can sing for me my sheep hear my voice brother mes so the shepher is not there to scatter is there to keep what God has given him and protected so we thank God that we've got a man who has not come through the window climb through a ventilator he has come through the process ofic Sanic the blessing in the body here we are God bless you amen do I appreciate the pastor hallelujah amen yeah let's get up on our feet and sing that song my sheep not my [Music] voice my sheep know my voice Sunday by day they abide in the fall and go not astray they love me because I have
