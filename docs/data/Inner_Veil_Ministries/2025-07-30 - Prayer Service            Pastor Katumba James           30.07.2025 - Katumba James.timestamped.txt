[36:37] we do pray and ask this. Amen.
[36:41] [Music]
[36:42] Amen.
[36:44] Let us sing one or two songs then we can
[36:47] go into a brief word of exaltation.
[36:51] Praise the name of our Lord.
[36:55] Let us sing that song. There is a name I
[36:58] love to hear. Praise the name of our
[37:01] Lord.
[37:03] Psalm number six.
[37:10] There is a name I love to him. I love to
[37:19] sing it.
[37:24] It sounds like music
[37:28] in my head. The sweetest
[37:33] name on earth. I love him. Oh,

[37:44] Oh,

[37:50] Oh,

[37:56] Because he first loved me.
[38:02] He tells me of a savior's
[38:07] love. Who died to set me free.
[38:15] He tells me of his precious blood. The

[40:27] [Music]
[40:31] Gal.
[40:33] [Music]
[40:52] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:55] Before we go to the reading of the
[40:56] scripture, let us sing that song living
[40:58] by faith because we want to talk about
[41:02] faith, a prayer of faith. Song number
[41:05] 24.
[41:08] Amen. The songs have a lot of deep
[41:10] meaning. Praise the name of our Lord.
[41:12] And we just take them by all our heart.
[41:18] I care not to what the tomorrow may
[41:23] bring. If shadows or sunshine or rain,
[41:29] [Music]
[41:31] the Lord I know l over everything
[41:37] and all of my worry is
[41:44] living by faith
[41:47] [Music]
[41:50] in Jesus above.
[41:52] [Music]
[41:56] trusting, confounding
[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] in his great love.
[42:04] [Applause]
[42:05] [Music]
[42:07] from all I'm safe
[42:10] [Applause]
[42:12] [Music]
[42:13] in his sheltering
[42:15] arm.
[42:20] I'm living by faith
[42:24] and I feel no alone.
[42:28] Living by faith. Oh, living by faith
[42:35] [Music]
[42:37] in Jesus abound.
[42:41] [Music]
[42:44] Trusting confounding

[43:01] in his sheltering arm.
[43:07] I'm living by faith

[43:15] [Music]
[43:19] Though tempest may blow and the storm
[43:23] clouds arise,
[43:25] obscuring the brightness of life.
[43:32] I'm never alarmed at the over skies. The
[43:38] master looks on the sky. And therefore,
[43:44] I'm living by faith.
[43:48] [Music]
[43:51] In Jesus abound,
[43:57] trusting confounding
[44:00] [Music]

[44:32] I know that he'll safely will carry me
[44:38] through no matter what evil be.
[44:43] [Music]
[44:46] Why should I care though the tempest may
[44:50] blow if Jesus was close to my son?
[44:59] Oh, I'm living by faith.
[45:03] [Music]
[45:31] Shelter.
[45:33] [Music]
[45:36] I'm living by faith

[45:45] M
[45:47] our Lord will return to this awesome
[45:52] sweet day. Our travels will then all be
[45:58] over.
[46:00] The master so gently will lead us away
[46:07] beyond the blessed heaven nation.
[46:14] Living by faith.
[46:20] Jesus abound.
[46:27] Trusting or finding
[46:32] in his great love.
[46:35] [Music]
[46:38] From all I'm safe
[46:42] [Music]
[46:44] in this sheltering arm.
[46:51] I'm living by faith
[46:55] and I feel no alone.
[47:00] Amen. Living by faith. Praise the name
[47:03] of the Lord. Let us go to James chapter
[47:05] 5. We take something like 20 minutes or
[47:09] so. Praise the name of the Lord. James 5
[47:12] and then verse 13 up to verse 15.
[47:18] The Bible says, "Is any among you
[47:21] afflicted?
[47:23] Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing
[47:27] psalms. Is any sick among you? Let him
[47:30] call for elders of the church, and let
[47:33] them pray over him, anointing him with
[47:36] the oil in the name of the Lord, and the
[47:39] prayer of faith shall save the sick, and
[47:43] the Lord shall raise him up, and if he
[47:46] have committed sins, they shall be
[47:49] forgiven. Amen. God speaking of his
[47:51] word, you may be seated. Praise the name
[47:53] of our Lord. So the Bible says the
[47:56] prayer of faith shall save the sick.
[48:00] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[48:02] know prayer is a petition
[48:06] is a desire you know that you express to
[48:09] God. And prayer is of God. Praise the
[48:13] name of our Lord. Because we see that
[48:16] our Lord Jesus Christ prayed.
[48:20] The Bible when you read in the
[48:21] scriptures, Christ prayed several times
[48:25] and when you read through also the Old
[48:27] Testament, you really find people were
[48:29] praying, you know, oh Lord, there is
[48:31] this, oh Lord, there is this. They were
[48:33] praying and then the Lord would be
[48:35] concerned about their heart's desires.
[48:39] Like for example,
[48:42] when you read in the scriptures,
[48:45] it is actually
[48:47] Cain who first went to worship after the
[48:51] fall. Because the Bible says in the
[48:53] process of time, it came to pass that
[48:55] Cain offered an offering to the Lord. Of
[48:59] course, we know before the fall, every
[49:02] evening, God would come and meet Adam
[49:04] and Eve. But then there's a particular
[49:07] day God came and Adam and Eve were not
[49:09] in their position. And of course that
[49:11] was because of sin. And sometimes also
[49:15] what holds us back from speaking to God
[49:17] with boldness is sin because you are
[49:20] afraid. You know like a child who has
[49:23] made any mistake at home will always try
[49:26] to shy away from their parents will
[49:28] always try to hide. When you call them
[49:30] to come, they hide somewhere to pretend
[49:32] to be busy on something else because
[49:34] there's something wrong. But that is
[49:37] something which God has addressed by the
[49:39] blood of Jesus Christ. Is that if you
[49:41] know that there is something wrong in
[49:43] your life, apply the blood of Jesus
[49:46] Christ and tell him, Lord, there is this
[49:49] problem I have. I've done something
[49:51] wrong. Wash me. Restore me back. Praise
[49:55] the name of our Lord. That's why you see
[49:57] in the Lord's prayer when you are
[49:59] praying to the Lord, he said, "Forgive
[50:01] us our trespasses." So repentance is our
[50:05] daily life as children of God. The same
[50:08] thing as forgiveness.
[50:10] So you shouldn't allow your weakness or
[50:13] your sin to take you away from prayer.
[50:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So that
[50:19] when you come to pray, confess, say,
[50:21] Lord, I have a weakness here. I've done
[50:24] something wrong here. You know because
[50:26] if you don't confess then you will not
[50:28] have faith in God. But when you pray
[50:31] then you trust that the Lord hearth you
[50:34] when you pray. Praise the name of our
[50:36] Lord. You are believing that what you
[50:39] are talking to him who listen to you
[50:41] what you are saying. And that's what he
[50:43] says. Come unto me and let us reason
[50:46] together. And then he says even if your
[50:48] sins be as red as scarlet they shall be
[50:52] white like snow. That's the promise of
[50:55] God says come, come unto me. He has
[50:59] every solution for all our failures and
[51:02] weaknesses. Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:04] So he says the prayer of faith shall
[51:08] save the sick. And then he says, "Is
[51:10] there anybody afflicted?
[51:13] And if he's afflicted, let him do what?
[51:15] Pray." That's in James 5:3.
[51:19] He says, "Is there any is there among
[51:22] you afflicted? Let him pray. Now that
[51:26] word afflicted means you are troubled.
[51:30] Means there are some form of hardship
[51:32] you're going through. Sometimes the
[51:35] troubles may be because of your health.
[51:37] Sometimes the troubles may be because of
[51:40] your family. Sometimes the troubles may
[51:42] be because of your place of work.
[51:44] Sometimes your troubles may be because
[51:46] of the community that you live in.
[51:48] Sometimes the troubles may be because of
[51:50] different fears. Maybe you have had some
[51:52] negative information or some things
[51:54] which are not pleasant. It can bring all
[51:57] those afflictions. So then he said if
[51:59] you have any affliction what do you do?
[52:02] Pray. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[52:05] what a friend we have in Jesus.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That you can tell him all your troubles.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[52:13] know it is very important for us as an
[52:16] individual. Praise the name of our Lord
[52:18] to always find time where you can sit
[52:22] down and then you just think about the
[52:25] Lord and then you speak to the Lord as
[52:27] an individual. Each of us at least has
[52:30] got that opportunity at our places where
[52:32] we stay. You know it may be maybe the
[52:35] whole day you've been too busy. You've
[52:36] been busy at place of work but at night
[52:39] maybe when other people are sleeping you
[52:41] can sit and just say Lord I want to
[52:43] speak to you. I want to make myself
[52:46] known unto you. And then you know you
[52:48] open up your heart to the Lord. Praise
[52:50] the name of our Lord. Even when you are
[52:52] sleeping in a small room, you're too
[52:54] many people. Nobody will refuse you from
[52:56] sitting down. Of course, you may not
[52:59] start praying at the top of your voice,
[53:01] everybody to hear, you know that kind of
[53:04] thing.
[53:05] I believe it was in covid time when the
[53:07] president was challenging all saints
[53:10] natho and then asking them these people
[53:13] of nas they make a lot of noise for me
[53:15] as if god cannot hear them when they
[53:17] don't use those equipments we believe
[53:19] god can hear us when we pray silently
[53:22] praise the name of our lord like if you
[53:24] are sleeping in a room you are many and
[53:27] and you are sharing a bed maybe or
[53:29] mattress many people you're not going to
[53:32] wake up in the night and tell people I'm
[53:33] going to pray and then you shout at the
[53:35] top of your voice. I believe that's not
[53:37] really the best way. But you can pray
[53:40] silently.
[53:42] You know, you can wake up, maybe lean on
[53:44] the wall or kneel down and then you pray
[53:47] silent and say, "Lord, this is my
[53:50] burden." Like Hannah, Hannah went into
[53:53] the temple in 1 Samuel chapter one and
[53:56] then she the words were not heard. But
[53:59] then the priest saw that this woman is
[54:01] mad. Then also Elezah. Elezah when he
[54:04] was going to look for a wife for Isaac,
[54:08] the Bible says in Genesis chapter 24
[54:12] that he prayed in his heart. He just
[54:14] knelt down because there were men around
[54:16] him we had gone with. But he knelt down
[54:19] and prayed in his heart and said Lord
[54:21] let it be that lady or that dam I'll
[54:25] tell give me a drink and he gives me
[54:27] drink then he will give the animals. Let
[54:29] that be the girl you have appointed in
[54:31] his heart. That's what he said. And he
[54:34] knelt down. This one never knew what he
[54:36] was talking about. But they knew he
[54:37] wanted a wife for Isaac. Then when he
[54:40] had finished praying in his heart,
[54:42] nobody had the words. God had the words.
[54:45] Then Rebecca comes. So we can also do
[54:49] the same thing at any time. Maybe you
[54:51] are traveling. You know, you're maybe
[54:54] seated in the tax. You can pretend as if
[54:57] you are sleeping and then you are
[54:58] praying.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord who refuse
[55:01] you from sleeping or pretending as if
[55:03] you are sleeping and then you are
[55:05] praying. So you can pray at any time in
[55:09] any place you can pray. Pray the name of
[55:11] our Lord. Some people when they are busy
[55:13] at their places of work busy they can
[55:15] excuse themselves that let me go to the
[55:17] washroom. But you are going there to do
[55:19] what? To silently pray. Praise the name
[55:22] of our Lord. So we can use opportunities
[55:24] everywhere to pray to God. Sometimes
[55:27] maybe they are putting you in a hard
[55:29] decision. Maybe you are in a meeting at
[55:31] some of these places of work and there's
[55:33] a decision for you to make. You can
[55:36] excuse yourself and have time of prayer.
[55:39] Those people may not allow you to pray
[55:41] in the before them but you can excuse
[55:43] yourself say Lord this is the challenge
[55:45] I have. What can I do? Which decision
[55:48] should I make? Which choice should I
[55:50] make? Praise the name of our Lord. You
[55:52] know there are those kind of thing and
[55:54] you know prayer builds a personal
[55:58] relationship with God. When you have
[56:01] confidence in God you know you'll say
[56:04] Lord but now I've heard this and
[56:06] sometimes prayer may not necessarily be
[56:08] that you're going to stay a long time
[56:10] praying or shouting a long time. It can
[56:13] be even two three words and say Lord I
[56:16] don't know what to do. Lord I'm stuck
[56:19] here. A good example was David. David
[56:23] was running away from Abselum and then
[56:25] the Bible says he was climbing the hill
[56:27] and Abselum had taken over the kingdom.
[56:30] Then one of the friends of David came
[56:32] and told him that Isopelos
[56:36] has connived has conspired with Absolum.
[56:40] What did David say? David said, "Oh God
[56:43] turned the wisdom of Isopel into
[56:46] foolishness." That was all.
[56:49] And then God brings another friend of
[56:51] David and God gives wisdom to David and
[56:54] tells him ah you go and stand with my
[56:57] son Abselum and tell him and know tell
[57:00] him that I'm with you so that you can
[57:02] defeat the council of Isopelos is how
[57:05] the Lord works out. So it may not be a
[57:08] long prayer. It's not about how long the
[57:10] prayer is, but it's about how you can
[57:13] bring it before the Lord with faith,
[57:16] believing that when I speak to the Lord,
[57:18] he will hear what I'm saying.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So
[57:22] sometimes some challenges come, you
[57:24] don't have time to pray or sometime you
[57:27] don't have time to fast, but you just
[57:29] only mention one or two words to the
[57:32] Lord and say, "Lord, have mercy upon
[57:35] me." And then the Lord will have mercy
[57:37] upon you. Praise the name of our Lord. A
[57:39] good example is
[57:43] Jehoshaphat.
[57:45] When you go and reading that story of
[57:46] Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat a righteous
[57:49] king went and sat with Ahab. And then
[57:54] Ahab said, "Let us go and fight in Ramos
[57:56] Gilead." Jehoshaphat went and fought
[57:59] with Ahab. But Ahab was so cheeky that
[58:02] he refused to put on the robes of the
[58:04] king and told Jehoshaphat you put on a
[58:07] put on the garments of a king. So when
[58:10] they went to fight in you know Ramos
[58:12] Gillad the Syrians saw the king and they
[58:16] thought that was Ahab. So they come to
[58:18] kill the king and they were thinking
[58:20] that Joseph rather it was Ahab. When
[58:24] they reached him they saw it was not
[58:25] Ahab. But now when Jehoshaphat saw that
[58:28] they coming to kill him, he just cried
[58:30] to Lord, Lord have mercy upon me, he
[58:33] didn't have time to fast. He didn't have
[58:35] time to say, "Let me kneel down fast."
[58:38] There was no time. It was a first
[58:40] reaction. Lord have mercy upon me. And
[58:43] then the Bible says God had Jehoshaphat
[58:46] and he took our gospel from killing him.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So any time
[58:51] you can pray to God in any kind of
[58:54] situation, you know, it can be maybe you
[58:56] are driving or you are in a taxi, you're
[58:58] in a motorcycle and there is an
[59:00] impending danger coming. What are you
[59:02] going to do? Would you say now there's
[59:04] not enough time to pray? You just cry
[59:06] out to the Lord there and then praise
[59:09] the name of our Lord. You know that's
[59:10] what the Bible says in Psalms 46 that
[59:14] the Lord is a very present help in
[59:18] trouble.
[59:19] So when trouble strikes like that, the
[59:22] Bible says God is already there. When
[59:24] the trouble is there, what do you do?
[59:26] Call upon him. Lord, there is this
[59:29] problem. Lord, there is this trouble.
[59:32] Lord, I'm being attacked. And then you
[59:34] see how the Lord can move all those
[59:36] things that are against you. So he says,
[59:39] if you are afflicted, you do what? You
[59:42] pray. Praise the name of our Lord. Learn
[59:45] to depend upon God. Learn to rely upon
[59:48] God in every situation that you go
[59:50] through in life. Whatever challenge it
[59:53] may be, it may be concerning your life,
[59:56] it may be concerning your place of work,
[59:58] it may be concerning where you live, it
[1:00:00] may be concerning your family, it may be
[1:00:02] concerning your desires. You know, there
[1:00:05] are some things you're trying to do and
[1:00:07] the enemy seems to fighting, blocking
[1:00:10] everything, fighting everything,
[1:00:12] hindering every move. So, what do you
[1:00:14] do? You just put it before the Lord in
[1:00:16] prayer.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And when
[1:00:20] you pray, have faith in God because the
[1:00:24] Bible says that soever comes to God in
[1:00:28] Hebrews chapter 11
[1:00:30] and then verse six it says, "But without
[1:00:34] faith it is impossible to please God.
[1:00:39] For who whosoever comes to God must
[1:00:42] believe that God is real and that God is
[1:00:46] the rewarder of them that diligently
[1:00:51] seek him. Diligently seek him. In other
[1:00:54] words, you are trusting in him. You are
[1:00:57] entirely depending upon him. You know,
[1:00:59] you are looking to God. My hope is not
[1:01:01] anywhere else. Lord, I'm only depending
[1:01:04] upon you. If you don't intervene in
[1:01:07] this, it is done. It is finished. Praise
[1:01:10] the name of our Lord. So you are
[1:01:12] diligently seeking him and then you have
[1:01:15] faith because you believe that the Lord
[1:01:17] can help you out of your situation. So
[1:01:19] you are not trusting anything else. You
[1:01:22] are just depending upon him. You know
[1:01:25] like that king
[1:01:27] Darius
[1:01:29] you know that night when Daniel was
[1:01:31] thrown in the lion is den he knew that
[1:01:33] the lions are very hungry. He knew that
[1:01:36] the lions Daniel is not enough for all
[1:01:38] those lions. But Darius was so diligent
[1:01:43] at night. He was so perseverant.
[1:01:48] He was desperate for Daniel. And then he
[1:01:50] was waiting on the Lord. And the Bible
[1:01:52] says there was no music in the palace.
[1:01:56] There was no singing. There was no
[1:01:58] dancing. There was no serving of
[1:02:00] alcohol. It was more of like a mournful
[1:02:02] frustration like Hannah, you know, Lord,
[1:02:06] deliver me from being barren. Lord,
[1:02:09] deliver me from this kind of condition.
[1:02:11] The same thing with any trouble you
[1:02:12] have. So, you present it to the Lord
[1:02:15] believing that the Lord will answer what
[1:02:18] you have need of. Praise the name of our
[1:02:20] Lord. And that's the way we approach
[1:02:22] God. You know, you just approach him and
[1:02:24] say, "Lord, this is the stress I'm
[1:02:26] living in. This is the condition I'm in.
[1:02:29] I've done all that I can do but I've
[1:02:32] reached my end. I've reached my limit.
[1:02:35] Praise the name of the Lord. And say,
[1:02:36] Lord, come and make a way. Come and open
[1:02:39] up. This is the heart's desire that I
[1:02:41] have. Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[1:02:43] let us go to Mark chapter 11.
[1:02:48] Mark chapter 11 and then verse 22 the
[1:02:53] Bible says and Jesus answering says unto
[1:02:56] them have faith in God. For verily I say
[1:03:01] unto you, that whosoever shall say unto
[1:03:04] this mountain, be th removed, and be
[1:03:08] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[1:03:11] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[1:03:15] that those things which he saith shall
[1:03:19] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:03:23] he saith. Therefore, I say unto you,
[1:03:26] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:03:30] pray, believe that you receive them and
[1:03:34] you shall have them. Praise the name of
[1:03:37] our Lord. He says, "Whatsoever things
[1:03:39] you desire, it doesn't limit us. Praise
[1:03:42] the name of our Lord. Your need may not
[1:03:44] be my need. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:48] Your troubles may not be my troubles."
[1:03:50] So at any instance we can pray to the
[1:03:53] Lord. Your need may be Lord I need a
[1:03:57] job. But if I have a job that's not my
[1:04:00] need it's your need. Maybe my need at my
[1:04:03] job is Lord open more doors for me.
[1:04:06] Maybe I'm again doors may be too many. I
[1:04:08] say Lord the work is too much. You see
[1:04:10] that? So it keeps on changing. Sometime
[1:04:13] you say Lord I don't have even any rest
[1:04:15] at place. You know there are some places
[1:04:17] of work where you have too much work
[1:04:19] until they make you forget God.
[1:04:22] So now your need may be different. Lord
[1:04:25] I find there is a trick of Satan here.
[1:04:28] You know whereby you are getting a lot
[1:04:30] of money but spiritually you are
[1:04:32] becoming dead because also those kind of
[1:04:34] stressions. Whatever you have need of is
[1:04:36] there but the devil has bound you that
[1:04:39] you have no interest in the things of
[1:04:42] God. Then say Lord there is a trouble
[1:04:44] Satan is trying to do. There is a cancer
[1:04:47] attacking me. You know sometimes they
[1:04:49] need Lord I've got all these things but
[1:04:53] have no people who can keep them or
[1:04:54] protect them. You know there are
[1:04:56] different various needs that we go
[1:04:58] through in life. So he says whatsoever
[1:05:01] you desire
[1:05:03] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:05:07] them and you shall have them. He says,
[1:05:10] "Have faith in God." So whatever you
[1:05:13] pray, believe that you receive it. And
[1:05:16] then the Bible says, you shall have what
[1:05:20] you pray for. So when you pray, believe
[1:05:23] that God is going to give me this. Don't
[1:05:25] start testifying negatively. I don't
[1:05:28] know if I'll make it. I don't know if
[1:05:29] I'll pass. I don't know if I'll get it.
[1:05:31] You stop that kind of negative
[1:05:33] confession. like Jonah. Jonah when he
[1:05:36] was in the belly of the sheep of the
[1:05:38] fish, he said those that observe lying
[1:05:42] vanities forsake their mercies. And
[1:05:45] brother Brham says Jonah had a lot of
[1:05:49] symptoms. He was in the fish below the
[1:05:53] sea. There were so many symptoms, but he
[1:05:56] said, "I will look to the temple."
[1:05:59] Praise the name of our Lord. He didn't
[1:06:01] look at his condition. He looked at the
[1:06:04] promises of God.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And brother
[1:06:08] Brham says that God when he met an old
[1:06:12] man like Abraham, he told him, I'm the
[1:06:14] blessed God. I'm the God with breasts.
[1:06:18] Then he said the breast of a mother,
[1:06:20] they give strength to the child. And
[1:06:22] brother Brham says that those blessed
[1:06:25] the promises of God or the breast or the
[1:06:28] milk are the promises of God which we
[1:06:30] look to. So here the Lord has told us
[1:06:32] whatsoever you desire it's a promise
[1:06:36] what is your desire and then he says ask
[1:06:39] and you shall receive
[1:06:42] seek and you shall find knock and the
[1:06:45] door shall be opened so let us not limit
[1:06:48] ourselves in prayer we have different
[1:06:51] needs we have different challenges we're
[1:06:53] going through whatever affliction we
[1:06:55] have let us make our requests known to
[1:06:59] the Lord Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:07:02] may God bless you so much. I believe we
[1:07:05] can get time to pray and then we shall
[1:07:10] close. Let us sing a song here and each
[1:07:14] of us can get down to pray.
[1:07:20] Let me get a song here.
[1:07:27] Let us sing Psalm 38. I am thine, oh
[1:07:30] Lord. I have heard thy voice. Draw me
[1:07:33] nearer. Let us draw nearer to the Lord
[1:07:36] in our prayers.
[1:07:40] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy
[1:07:48] voice and it told thy love to me.
[1:07:58] But I long to rise in the arms of faith
[1:08:08] and be closer.
[1:08:12] Draw to thee.
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] Draw me near.
[1:08:24] near a blessed Lord to thy cross where
[1:08:31] thou
[1:08:33] has done.

[1:08:57] Oh,
[1:08:59] consecrate
[1:09:01] me now to thy servings,
[1:09:07] Lord, by the power of grace divine.
[1:09:17] Let my soul look up with a steadfast
[1:09:26] hope and my will be lost in thy draw me
[1:09:35] near Lord draw me near
[1:09:41] [Music]

[1:09:50] those house down?

[1:09:59] [Music]

[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:17] All the pure delight
[1:10:22] of a single
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] that before
[1:10:29] thy throne I spend.
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:36] When I kneel in prayer and with thee, my
[1:10:44] God, I commune
[1:10:48] as friend with friend. Draw me nearer.
[1:10:55] Draw me near.
[1:10:59] [Applause]

[1:11:14] Draw me near
[1:11:20] a blessing Lord
[1:11:26] to thy precious
[1:11:29] bleeding
[1:11:31] sound.
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:35] There are depths of love that I can not
[1:11:43] know till I cross the narrow
[1:11:50] sea.
[1:11:54] There are heights of joy that I may not
[1:12:02] reach till I resting.
[1:12:07] Peace with thee. Draw me nearer. Draw me
[1:12:14] near
[1:12:16] around
[1:12:18] near a blessed Lord to thy cross where
[1:12:25] thou has died.
[1:12:31] Draw me near
[1:12:38] a blessing Lord
[1:12:43] to thy preious
[1:12:46] bleeding
[1:12:49] sign. Each of us can speak to the Lord.
[1:12:52] Father, how we thank you, Father, that
[1:12:55] your love has drawn us nearer to you,
[1:12:58] Lord. Blessed be thy holy name, Lord,
[1:13:01] forever more. How we worship you, Lord.
[1:13:05] How we thank you, Father, for the
[1:13:07] privilege, Lord, that we can speak to
[1:13:10] you all that's in our hearts, Father,
[1:13:12] and how you desire, Lord, to know from
[1:13:16] us, Father. No wonder when you demanded
[1:13:19] job to tell your heavenly father what
[1:13:22] was in him. Lord, we are thankful father
[1:13:26] that we have the opportunity Lord to
[1:13:28] call upon your name. We have the
[1:13:30] opportunity Lord to mention Lord to
[1:13:34] bring our prayers unto you Lord to bring
[1:13:36] our petitions at you Lord to make our
[1:13:40] requests all made known unto you Lord.
[1:13:43] And now you say, "If we are afflicted,
[1:13:46] Lord, we pray unto you, Lord. A prayer
[1:13:48] of faith shall save the sick. A prayer
[1:13:52] of faith availth much. Lord, we are
[1:13:55] grateful, heavenly father, for your
[1:13:57] loving kindness, Lord, for the door
[1:14:00] you've opened for us and how we are
[1:14:02] taught by your prophet. It's an open
[1:14:05] check that whatever we desire, we just
[1:14:08] only sign our name and we receive it.
[1:14:11] Lord, may you increase our faith,
[1:14:14] heavenly father, in all our needs that
[1:14:16] we bring unto you. In all our nees that
[1:14:19] we bring unto you, that father, you may
[1:14:21] speedily give them to us, Lord, for God

[1:14:27] burdens into your hands. We lift all our
[1:14:29] physical needs, Father. Oh God in one

[1:26:16] I heard an old old story.
[1:26:20] How our savior came from glory.
[1:26:24] How he gave his life on Calvary to save
[1:26:30] a rich like me.
[1:26:33] I heard about his groaning of his
[1:26:38] precious blood at
[1:26:41] Then I repented of my sin and won the
[1:26:47] victory. Oh,
[1:26:50] victory
[1:26:52] in Jesus
[1:26:54] my savior
[1:26:56] forever.
[1:26:58] He sought me and bought me with his
[1:27:04] redeeming blood.
[1:27:07] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[1:27:13] love is due.
[1:27:15] He plunged me to victory
[1:27:19] beneath the cleansing flower.
[1:27:24] I heard about his healing of his
[1:27:28] cleansing powering,
[1:27:32] how he made the lame to walk again and
[1:27:37] cause the blind to see.
[1:27:41] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and
[1:27:45] heal my broken spirit."
[1:27:49] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[1:27:55] the victory. Oh
[1:27:58] victory
[1:28:00] in Jesus
[1:28:02] my savior
[1:28:04] forever.
[1:28:06] He sought me and bought me with his
[1:28:12] redeeming blood.
[1:28:15] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[1:28:20] love is.
[1:28:23] He plunged me to victory
[1:28:28] beneath the cleansing cloud.
[1:28:32] I heard about a manion he has built for
[1:28:37] me in glory. And I heard about the
[1:28:43] streets of God beyond the crystal sea,
[1:28:49] about the angels singing. And now all
[1:28:54] redemption story.
[1:28:57] And some sweet day I'll sing up there
[1:29:01] the song of victory.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah. for victory
[1:29:08] in Jesus
[1:29:10] my savior
[1:29:12] forever.
[1:29:14] He bought me and bought me with his
[1:29:20] redee.
