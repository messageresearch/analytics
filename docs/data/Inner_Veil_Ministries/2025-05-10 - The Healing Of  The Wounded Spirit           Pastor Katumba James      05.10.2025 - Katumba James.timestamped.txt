[36:12] Praise the name of our Lord. We
[36:14] expecting over 200 people to be with us,
[36:19] maybe over 70 or 80 pastors to be
[36:24] now the Lord will give the grace that
[36:26] day.
[36:28] So I call upon your support
[36:31] that you send your contributions to
[36:33] brother
[36:36] can have the meal of all of us together.
[36:40] We need I think about one and a half
[36:42] million shillings for lunch.
[36:48] I was asking brother Peter on Friday
[36:52] and then he said he has only 110,000
[36:58] and that was what was saved from the
[37:00] previous time.
[37:04] So I call upon your contribution.
[37:07] Last time I think we put in little
[37:10] I don't think it was more than 300,000
[37:15] the contributions which came from the
[37:16] people.
[37:18] So you can imagine where the balance
[37:20] came from.
[37:23] So we just need to be concerned about
[37:25] these burdens.
[37:27] Let us be part of the services of the
[37:29] Lord.
[37:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Be like
[37:34] theite woman.
[37:37] All the other widow said that I have
[37:38] only the last meal.
[37:42] But then the prophet told him told her
[37:44] give me that.
[37:47] She didn't know what was going to
[37:48] happen.
[37:50] But the Lord cares.
[37:52] Praise the name of Lord. So let us not
[37:55] be in that situation.
[37:58] when was telling Esther
[38:03] &gt;&gt; that you know you never know this is
[38:05] your time of helping when you're in the
[38:07] kingdom
[38:11] and then he told her but if you don't
[38:14] help
[38:16] will come from elsewhere
[38:19] at least I don't want that help to come
[38:21] from elsewhere
[38:23] I want it to come from me
[38:26] praise the name of our Lord say I'm the
[38:28] one going to support
[38:30] not our brothers I think will do
[38:34] will do just be partaking of the
[38:36] blessing of the lord
[38:39] praise the name of now before go the
[38:42] reading of the word invite the youth to
[38:45] come and sing

[46:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray
[46:59] again.
[47:01] Father again we thank you.
[47:04] We thank you that you are the great
[47:05] physician
[47:08] and you are ever present Lord
[47:11] to heal us in every situation.
[47:14] We pray may speak to our hearts
[47:17] and you said in your word
[47:19] that you sent your word and heal them.
[47:24] And we pray that the healing of our
[47:25] bodies,
[47:27] the healing of our spirits and the
[47:30] healing of our souls
[47:32] happen when we are hearing the word of
[47:33] God
[47:35] that he may set every one of us free
[47:38] that we may be able to rejoice before
[47:40] it. preeminence upon these psalms that
[47:44] you may speak to us that we may hear
[47:46] from you for the glory and horn of your
[47:49] name in the name of Jesus Christ.
[47:53] Amen. Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles
[47:58] in Proverbs chapter 18.
[48:02] We're reading from verse 10
[48:06] up to verse 19.
[48:10] The Bible says,
[48:12] &gt;&gt; "The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[48:16] The righteous runth it and is safe.
[48:26] The rich man's wealth is his strong city
[48:29] and as an high wall in his own consent.
[48:48] Before destruction, the heart of the man
[48:51] is and before honor is humility.
[49:16] He thatth a matter before he hears it,
[49:20] it is folly and shame unto him.
[49:28] The spirit of a man will sustain his
[49:31] infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can
[49:34] bear
[49:46] The heart of the prudent getth
[49:48] knowledge, and the ear of the wise
[49:51] seeketh knowledge.
[50:02] A man's gift makes room for him and
[50:05] brings him before great men.
[50:13] He that is first in his own cause seemth
[50:16] just, but his neighbor cometh and
[50:19] searches him.
[50:28] The Lord causes contentions to seize and
[50:31] part between the mighty.
[50:34] [Music]
[50:48] A brother offended is harder to be one
[50:51] than a strong city and their contentions
[50:55] are like the bars of a castle.
[51:17] May God bless his word.
[51:20] You may be seated.
[51:22] So I want to preach on the subject
[51:25] the healing of the wounded spirit.
[51:32] wounded. Praise the name of Lord. You
[51:35] know, maybe afflicted,
[51:39] &gt;&gt; distressed,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; bruised,
[51:48] praise the name of our Lord. The healing
[51:50] of
[51:52] the wounded spirit.
[51:57] So yeah, the Bible has told us
[52:00] In verse 14,
[52:02] &gt;&gt; the spirit of a man will sustain his
[52:05] infirmity.
[52:10] In other words, maybe you know your
[52:12] disease,
[52:14] you know, so the spirit can sustain you
[52:17] to a certain extent
[52:21] to be patient,
[52:24] you know, to endure.
[52:26] But then he says
[52:29] when a person when a a spirit is
[52:32] wounded,
[52:36] stricken
[52:38] or you know depressed,
[52:43] you know, maybe you know afflicted,
[52:48] you know, like on Wednesday we are
[52:50] talking about Samson being afflicted.
[52:55] you know the words of you know
[53:00] they were so much afflicting Samson
[53:05] you know putting a lot of pressure on
[53:07] you
[53:09] and you know there's where the scripture
[53:11] says
[53:12] that if you have a wife
[53:15] you know and all the time her words are
[53:18] just depressing you
[53:23] then he says you'd rather live on the
[53:25] roof rooftop.
[53:28] Now you can imagine you're not meant to
[53:30] sleep outside
[53:33] but you find sleeping in your house
[53:36] with your own wife
[53:39] it is so terrible.
[53:42] [Music]
[53:44] So now you see that oppressed Samson
[53:49] &gt;&gt; by her words
[53:52] by her deception.
[53:54] And then we see that we also go through
[53:56] the same kind of situations
[53:59] in different kind of circumstances
[54:02] because of the pressures of the time.
[54:06] Maybe because of the things you are
[54:07] aspiring to achieve.
[54:10] Sometimes it can be because of the
[54:11] sicknesses.
[54:14] Sometimes can be because of the
[54:15] disadvantaged background you have.
[54:19] You know the family you were born from.
[54:22] you know, not so much privileges that
[54:24] you had.
[54:26] [Music]
[54:27] You know, even eating a good meal would
[54:29] be by luck.
[54:32] Like now many children are studying
[54:35] their last term.
[54:39] But then you get some of these children
[54:40] on the road selling something.
[54:45] Then sometimes
[54:47] others are in school
[54:49] like I remember I think it was either on
[54:51] Friday
[54:53] when I was traveling back.
[54:57] I was going back home and then I think I
[55:00] was passing through Kag
[55:02] and then there was a mother
[55:06] carrying a baby on her back
[55:09] and carrying a hole.
[55:12] I think it was I'm just forgetting the
[55:14] exact time but it was during that time
[55:15] midday
[55:18] and then there was a young man a young
[55:20] boy of about 10 12 years
[55:25] also carrying a hole
[55:27] and I felt bad
[55:30] the other children are in school
[55:33] but then this one is in the garden with
[55:35] the son who's meant to be in school
[55:39] and of course the young such a young boy
[55:42] would think about the friends who are in
[55:44] school
[55:46] but then they are taking you to the
[55:47] garden or maybe something different like
[55:49] that and all these kind of things can
[55:52] affect us.
[55:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Different
[55:57] kind of scenarios in life.
[56:01] Now we are living in a time
[56:05] which is a neurotic age.
[56:09] You know People
[56:12] are crazy.
[56:15] You know the decisions they make are
[56:17] craziness
[56:20] in the message the junction of time
[56:24] he said and if they have been through
[56:26] all of these things
[56:29] when all the world history is climaxing
[56:31] in this great drama.
[56:36] What's the matter?
[56:38] What makes people so nervous?
[56:43] Why is even the psychiatrist
[56:48] are coming to be prayed for?
[56:52] Why is the world in a navious age,
[56:57] a neuroretic age,
[57:00] when the people can't wait
[57:04] down the street 90 miles an hour,
[57:10] stop at a beer joint,
[57:13] two hours
[57:15] before they go home, run over people.
[57:20] You know it's just like now on the road
[57:22] somebody can just come and enter the
[57:24] road
[57:27] doesn't regard who are using the road
[57:30] only to enter
[57:32] crosses these cars and then stops ahead
[57:37] and you start wondering what's the rush
[57:38] for
[57:40] like now you can imagine this was in
[57:42] 1956
[57:45] somebody driving very fast
[57:49] speed, you know, 90 mph is about 150 km
[57:53] an hour,
[57:56] you know, and then after driving too
[57:59] fast,
[58:00] he's rushing to go to a drinking point
[58:05] and then he sits there.
[58:07] Then you ask him, "Why were you rushing
[58:09] on the road?
[58:12] Madness.
[58:15] What's everybody in such a hurry?
[58:19] You can't visit your neighbor.
[58:23] You don't have no friends.
[58:25] You don't know who lives next door to
[58:27] you.
[58:29] You ain't got time to do this.
[58:33] You are in a hurry.
[58:36] What is the matter?
[58:40] Praise the name of So you see tension is
[58:42] building up everywhere.
[58:46] Circumstances keep on oppressing us
[58:49] and then you find that yourself.
[58:53] You are completely under you know
[58:55] oppression
[58:58] at your place of work. ts they want you
[59:01] to do
[59:04] like now these days they retrench the
[59:07] stuff
[59:11] and now the gaps which are left there
[59:14] you are the one to fill those gaps
[59:17] and your salary is not increased
[59:21] and you are just afraid you don't want
[59:23] to lose your job
[59:26] a lot of pressure all the
[59:30] you know, a lot of pressure in
[59:32] everything.
[59:34] And so we see that we are living at such
[59:36] a terrible time.
[59:39] And everybody trying to work hard,
[59:42] everybody trying to achieve this. After
[59:45] achieving this, then there's this
[59:47] target. After this target, then there's
[59:49] this target.
[59:51] The world is just in a neurotic age.
[59:57] Pressure everywhere.
[59:59] Now in the message letting off pressure
[1:00:03] he says we are living in anetic age
[1:00:08] tension.
[1:00:11] Everybody is racing here
[1:00:15] going there and going nowhere.
[1:00:20] Praise the name of. So it is just a
[1:00:22] circle like this
[1:00:25] circle
[1:00:27] and then you become old in a circle
[1:00:32] and at the end of the day whatever you
[1:00:34] struggled for
[1:00:36] you lose it.
[1:00:39] Then he says it's just that kind of an
[1:00:42] age
[1:00:44] and I know this church
[1:00:47] would be plugged with it.
[1:00:52] And as everywhere is plugged with it,
[1:00:56] the tabernacle is plugged with it.
[1:01:00] Everywhere
[1:01:01] the whole world, you know, it's just
[1:01:04] like, you know, a plague, you know,
[1:01:09] It's a day of pressure.
[1:01:12] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
[1:01:16] and wait.
[1:01:19] Drive 90 miles an hour
[1:01:22] and then go home for supper
[1:01:25] and wait for two hours to get it ready.
[1:01:31] But you've been running around
[1:01:35] to nowhere
[1:01:38] madness.
[1:01:40] Then he says it's a time that rushing
[1:01:45] and speeding
[1:01:48] it gets you to a nous tension.
[1:01:53] The wife say something a little
[1:01:56] contrary.
[1:02:01] You want to fly off
[1:02:05] temper.
[1:02:07] Husband says something.
[1:02:10] You will part your foot
[1:02:15] and tell him get in the room.
[1:02:18] See well now husband
[1:02:21] I don't want know what's with you.
[1:02:25] Get out there.
[1:02:27] attention
[1:02:29] wife I'm so nervous
[1:02:32] why what's the matter all this together
[1:02:38] this tension building
[1:02:42] then the result of it is
[1:02:45] doing something wrong
[1:02:49] acting out of place
[1:02:52] that's right now it will take the poor
[1:02:56] act that way.
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:02] It will make the middle class act that
[1:03:04] way.
[1:03:07] It will make the rich act that way.
[1:03:10] It will make the wrong act that way.
[1:03:14] It will make the pretty good act that
[1:03:16] way.
[1:03:19] It will make the good act that way
[1:03:23] because it is tension
[1:03:26] steam build up.
[1:03:29] Go to blow it out somewhere.
[1:03:34] You don't you blow the boiler up
[1:03:41] wounded spirits.
[1:03:44] Then he says, "Now we find that it
[1:03:47] builds up as the day goes by.
[1:03:53] You talk to your boss. If you are
[1:03:56] working
[1:03:58] or so and so if you speak to the kids,
[1:04:02] come here now. Everybody is guilty.
[1:04:08] I'm guilty. You are guilty. We do things
[1:04:12] under pressure
[1:04:14] that we wouldn't do otherwise.
[1:04:18] So there is an excess pressure built up
[1:04:21] today.
[1:04:24] Before I go further, I might say this. I
[1:04:29] believe it is the enemy
[1:04:32] coming down
[1:04:34] and pressing.
[1:04:36] It is the devil.
[1:04:39] And we know the coming of the Lord is at
[1:04:41] hand.
[1:04:43] And the Bible says in the last days that
[1:04:47] the devil would go like a roaring lion.
[1:04:52] And if he would get you under pressure,
[1:04:56] hurrying,
[1:04:58] running over something,
[1:05:00] you'll make decisions
[1:05:03] that you wouldn't make
[1:05:06] if you would sit down and think over it.
[1:05:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Living
[1:05:13] under pressure.
[1:05:15] And you know this happens everywhere.
[1:05:18] at home, at places of work, in the
[1:05:22] neighborhood, in the communities where
[1:05:24] we live.
[1:05:25] You know, sometimes can happen between
[1:05:27] you and your friends
[1:05:29] or it can happen between you and your
[1:05:31] husband or your wife
[1:05:34] or between you and your parents or
[1:05:36] between your your children and yourself.
[1:05:41] Anywhere it can happen.
[1:05:44] And so you get your spirit is wounded.
[1:05:48] Your spirit is afflicted.
[1:05:52] You don't know sometimes what to do.
[1:05:55] Sometimes you make wrong decisions.
[1:05:59] Praise the name of God. And so you see
[1:06:02] how the devil works out
[1:06:05] and you know the devil can set you into
[1:06:07] something
[1:06:10] and leaves you there to be afflicted.
[1:06:14] Praise the name of God. He gets you into
[1:06:16] a situation that's not pleasing.
[1:06:20] Sometimes
[1:06:22] it can be because of your own weaknesses
[1:06:29] or your rebellious spirit.
[1:06:35] You know, you rebel over something
[1:06:38] and then it gets you into trouble. Of
[1:06:41] course, you may not know that I'm
[1:06:43] getting into trouble.
[1:06:46] Just like the prodigal son, he had a
[1:06:49] good father.
[1:06:51] Everything
[1:06:53] there is nothing that he lacked.
[1:06:55] But the group influence
[1:06:59] say why don't you tell your father to
[1:07:00] give you what belongs to him
[1:07:03] and then he got what belonged to him.
[1:07:05] And then the Bible says not so many
[1:07:08] days.
[1:07:10] Of course in that condition he didn't
[1:07:13] know that he was wrong.
[1:07:16] You know he was busy enjoying the wealth
[1:07:20] feeling the power of money.
[1:07:23] I can do this. I can do this. I can do
[1:07:27] this and a show off
[1:07:30] not knowing he was already on the path
[1:07:33] of destruction.
[1:07:36] And even as sometimes that we can get
[1:07:38] ourselves into those kind of challenges
[1:07:42] not knowing you're on the path of
[1:07:43] destruction.
[1:07:46] So now when he got everything
[1:07:49] he went to a far country
[1:07:52] he went into captivity
[1:07:54] but he didn't know that he was in
[1:07:55] captivity
[1:07:58] until he wasted everything
[1:08:01] and the realestrations came to him.
[1:08:06] no food. Those days he was, you know,
[1:08:09] busy wasting a lot of money.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Yesterday I was reading a certain story
[1:08:17] about the daughter of the president of
[1:08:19] Cameroon.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; She lives in fivestar or highar hotel in
[1:08:26] Switzerland.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; And then they were saying that since
[1:08:33] 1980s
[1:08:36] They spent $65 million
[1:08:41] to just hire that place for them.
[1:08:50] But now you see, you can get yourself
[1:08:52] under such pressure.
[1:08:56] Pressure.
[1:08:58] There's a class you want to be living
[1:09:00] in,
[1:09:02] but yet you can't afford it.
[1:09:04] you can't sustain it.
[1:09:07] You can't
[1:09:09] same thing now which happens these days.
[1:09:13] Maybe you've just got a job
[1:09:15] and then you want to buy a very
[1:09:17] expensive car.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; But a car does not use water.
[1:09:30] You get it?
[1:09:32] even driving it to town. You can't
[1:09:36] you can't afford the fuel.
[1:09:39] When it comes for servicing,
[1:09:44] they're asking you for a lot of money.
[1:09:47] Like there are some of those expensive
[1:09:48] cars.
[1:09:51] I'm just forgetting some of those names.
[1:09:54] But just servicing it,
[1:09:57] you need $30,000
[1:10:01] over 100 million. So just service it.
[1:10:07] And I also want to bribe this
[1:10:11] pressure.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Cyrus knows them.
[1:10:18] Pressure
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; and that's what was happening to this
[1:10:22] prodigal son.
[1:10:24] You are having the money but you don't
[1:10:26] know how to make the money.
[1:10:30] How do you spend
[1:10:32] and you can't get inside?
[1:10:36] You're going to waste everything you
[1:10:38] have
[1:10:40] because the needs keep on coming,
[1:10:44] problems keep on coming,
[1:10:46] pressures keep on coming.
[1:10:49] So now before you spend
[1:10:52] where is the next money going to come
[1:10:56] then you make a right decision.
[1:10:59] Why if I spend all this
[1:11:01] what will I have tomorrow?
[1:11:05] So this prodigal son
[1:11:08] he just wasted everything.
[1:11:10] And you know the Bible says a rich man
[1:11:14] has many friends.
[1:11:17] But even when you are poor,
[1:11:21] even your neighbors just despise you.
[1:11:26] A very bad condition. You may have
[1:11:28] wisdom,
[1:11:30] but everybody will despise your wisdom.
[1:11:34] So the Bible says a poor man uses tells
[1:11:37] those stories.
[1:11:43] He wants this but doesn't go directly.
[1:11:50] You know,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; so now the prodigal son when he wasted
[1:11:55] everything
[1:11:57] even his very friends left him.
[1:11:59] And then the Bible says he went and
[1:12:02] joined a man of that country
[1:12:07] who had a farm.
[1:12:10] Now you can imagine a Jew
[1:12:14] to go and work in swine
[1:12:19] when the swine were eating husks.
[1:12:24] You know even these days speaks eat
[1:12:26] husks.
[1:12:28] A man was salvating
[1:12:31] and the Bible says nobody would give him
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:36] held in captivity.
[1:12:40] Praise the name of our Lord. So we see
[1:12:42] even the children of Israel,
[1:12:45] they were held in captivity
[1:12:49] when they rejected the word of the Lord.
[1:12:52] When they rejected the path of
[1:12:54] righteousness,
[1:12:56] then they got themselves in captivity.
[1:12:59] And the same thing with us.
[1:13:02] We can end up in captivity
[1:13:06] when we don't obey the word of God.
[1:13:10] It may be a captivity of a certain
[1:13:12] condition.
[1:13:14] It may be a captivity
[1:13:17] that demons just keep on tormenting you.
[1:13:20] A demon of anger.
[1:13:23] You become annoyed over nothing.
[1:13:27] You know it can be another
[1:13:30] you know a bad habit.
[1:13:32] You know you've gotten hold in a
[1:13:34] situation which is not pleasant.
[1:13:38] Praise the name of our Lord. There was a
[1:13:40] young girl here
[1:13:42] in the message from that time.
[1:13:46] This girl
[1:13:49] refused to obey her parents.
[1:13:54] And when she refused to obey her
[1:13:56] parents,
[1:13:58] she saw a young man
[1:14:00] because he had good hair.
[1:14:03] She fell for that young man.
[1:14:10] And even some people can just fall for
[1:14:13] somebody because of something
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:19] and then they go they turn their ears
[1:14:22] from hearing and correction.
[1:14:27] They have their friends they are
[1:14:28] following.
[1:14:30] So now in the message from that time it
[1:14:34] says going into the emergency room
[1:14:41] there was a beautiful young woman
[1:14:46] sitting there
[1:14:48] great brown eyes
[1:14:52] and dark hair.
[1:14:54] She looked like
[1:14:56] she would have been a queen for any
[1:14:59] man's palace.
[1:15:04] Said, "How do you do?"
[1:15:07] She said, "How do you do, brother
[1:15:10] Branham?"
[1:15:12] I looked around
[1:15:14] and there they was in a straight jacket
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:21] and screaming
[1:15:25] and then cursing
[1:15:28] and a woman using the bed pan and wiping
[1:15:31] her face in it.
[1:15:38] Excuse that. I looked around and there
[1:15:41] was then he said for after eating your
[1:15:44] breakfast you just okay then he says and
[1:15:47] there was
[1:15:49] there was what your faith was when you
[1:15:52] preach divine healing
[1:15:56] then he said I said well I just don't
[1:16:00] know where to start first
[1:16:05] the younger lady said
[1:16:07] I wish you would start with me fast.
[1:16:13] Now you can imagine
[1:16:15] young woman
[1:16:17] put in an emergency
[1:16:22] you know and then now brother Brandham
[1:16:24] reaches the room with many people were
[1:16:26] there
[1:16:28] and then he sees the mess in the place
[1:16:32] they wouldn't put them with with other
[1:16:34] sick people in the church.
[1:16:37] Then he said, "Where do I start from?"
[1:16:40] And then this girl said, "Start with
[1:16:42] me."
[1:16:44] The young lady said, "I wish you would
[1:16:47] start with me first.
[1:16:49] If you don't, I said you are not a
[1:16:54] patient."
[1:16:55] She said, "Yes, sir."
[1:16:58] I said, "Well, what's the matter?"
[1:17:02] She said, "Mr. Brham, Mr. I was raised
[1:17:05] in a Christian home.
[1:17:09] I was raised to honor God.
[1:17:12] She said, "One time I got out with a
[1:17:15] boy.
[1:17:18] My mother and father
[1:17:20] warned me not to go with such a boy."
[1:17:24] But said he was ch.
[1:17:27] He had you know hair pretty.
[1:17:32] You can imagine those things.
[1:17:35] Maybe he was driving a car or he had a
[1:17:38] good motorcycle
[1:17:40] or you would change clothes
[1:17:42] and then your ears cannot hear your
[1:17:44] parents
[1:17:47] and then you go with the neighbor
[1:17:50] or your friend
[1:17:52] or wherever it is. That's where her
[1:17:55] problem started from
[1:17:58] not hearing.
[1:18:02] Let us go to paragraph 38.
[1:18:07] He said, "Now this younger lady,
[1:18:12] I say to her,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; what happened?"
[1:18:19] She said, "Well, a boy." This boy smoked
[1:18:26] and said, "He tried to get me to smoke
[1:18:30] and I wouldn't do it.
[1:18:33] and said one night he gave me a piece of
[1:18:37] a candy
[1:18:42] that had been domated
[1:18:49] Spanish fly. Then he said, "You veterary
[1:18:52] doctors know what that means."
[1:18:55] So she said, "He got me on the wrong
[1:18:59] road.
[1:19:02] She said, "Then I eat this candy
[1:19:06] thinking it was all right."
[1:19:09] She said, "I don't know what happened
[1:19:12] till the next day
[1:19:15] and my morals as a young lady
[1:19:19] was ruined."
[1:19:21] He raped her
[1:19:26] and maybe she came awake when he had
[1:19:28] already taken off.
[1:19:33] And she said, I thought,
[1:19:36] what is the difference?
[1:19:39] Because like maybe she tried to keep
[1:19:41] herself sober,
[1:19:44] but then how do you keep yourself sober
[1:19:48] with the wrong company?
[1:19:52] They trick you
[1:19:55] like Samson and
[1:19:57] Samson thought he's keeping himself
[1:19:59] sober
[1:20:01] thinking that cared about his life
[1:20:06] but was about money.
[1:20:09] And even this young man with pretty hair
[1:20:11] was about pleasure and wasting his life.
[1:20:17] No value for her.
[1:20:20] So after wasting her
[1:20:22] throw her there and then when she came
[1:20:25] back to her senses
[1:20:27] said now what values do I have now
[1:20:31] then she started drinking
[1:20:33] see how wrong road she was taking
[1:20:37] but how did she start
[1:20:40] refusing to obey the parent
[1:20:43] and sometimes these things can start as
[1:20:46] simple as that
[1:20:50] in our Christian life. It can also start
[1:20:54] by you rebelling against the word of
[1:20:56] God.
[1:20:58] Then captivity keeps on increasing.
[1:21:03] The devil takes on more room.
[1:21:06] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:21:08] like coming to church in timeh
[1:21:12] I think I'll go at any time.
[1:21:14] But then there are things you have
[1:21:16] troubles in your life.
[1:21:19] There are things that are binding you
[1:21:22] but you are failing to obey the simple
[1:21:24] things
[1:21:27] by 9:00.
[1:21:29] We should be in church.
[1:21:32] I I have a lot of things to do.
[1:21:35] So it holds you.
[1:21:39] It takes time to release your
[1:21:40] deliverance
[1:21:44] because you're not doing the simple
[1:21:45] things.
[1:21:48] song service
[1:21:50] I will not be there. So even the things
[1:21:53] that bind you cannot relieve you.
[1:21:57] When the preacher comes to preach
[1:21:59] your mind is still troubled. You are on
[1:22:02] the other thing. You are on the other
[1:22:04] thing. What is it? You know we need to
[1:22:08] learn to be obedient
[1:22:11] to the word of God. However simple it
[1:22:14] is, it matters a lot before God.
[1:22:18] see that you don't have an excuse.
[1:22:22] Praise the name of the Lord. Why would I
[1:22:24] miss church service on Wednesday
[1:22:28] when I work in Ginger Town?
[1:22:32] But you make sure that you are busy
[1:22:33] through that day.
[1:22:36] Your schedule is about making more
[1:22:38] money.
[1:22:41] So how are you going to get the favor of
[1:22:43] God
[1:22:45] if you cannot obey the things of God?
[1:22:50] You know God was telling Eli
[1:22:54] about his children and then he said
[1:22:58] those who take me lightly
[1:23:03] you know they don't honor me. Then he
[1:23:06] said I take them lightly.
[1:23:10] So how do we take the things of God?
[1:23:14] You know, but you need God to deliver
[1:23:16] you, but yet at the same time, you don't
[1:23:19] care about him.
[1:23:21] You don't want to obey even the least
[1:23:23] things.
[1:23:26] Praise the name of our Lord. So how are
[1:23:28] you going to be helped?
[1:23:30] And so you find that the devil takes
[1:23:32] opportunity
[1:23:34] and gets more of bondage.
[1:23:38] He keeps on binding you, binding you.
[1:23:42] Like now this girl,
[1:23:44] see the trend,
[1:23:46] she lost her trust in her parents
[1:23:51] and then started trusting this young man
[1:23:54] until this young man wasted her.
[1:23:58] Then she started getting into a deeper
[1:24:01] wrong side.
[1:24:04] Said, "I started drinking."
[1:24:06] And then he said,
[1:24:08] She said, "I joined church.
[1:24:12] I did everything I know how to do." And
[1:24:16] he said, "Finally, I served a time at
[1:24:20] the good shepherd's home in the Catholic
[1:24:22] institution.
[1:24:25] She went to many different places
[1:24:29] until she just became a prostitute.
[1:24:34] And then they would arrest her, put her
[1:24:37] in prison,
[1:24:39] two years, three years, comes back just
[1:24:43] a wasted life,
[1:24:46] wounded,
[1:24:50] you know that kind of condition.
[1:24:53] And then he says,
[1:24:55] she did everything.
[1:24:59] Then he said,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I said I drank alcohol.
[1:25:04] I said then I would quit that then
[1:25:08] picked it up again.
[1:25:10] I served two years in the woman's
[1:25:12] penicary
[1:25:15] then I would come out. I joined another
[1:25:18] church and said then you do a bit good.
[1:25:22] She said I heard about your meetings.
[1:25:26] I thought I would come down
[1:25:29] and see if you would help me
[1:25:33] trying to get back
[1:25:37] from where she left when she disobeyed
[1:25:39] her parents.
[1:25:41] What a long journey she took.
[1:25:45] What a long time of captivity.
[1:25:49] Like children of Israel,
[1:25:51] 70 years in captivity.
[1:25:54] I don't know what your captivity is this
[1:25:56] morning.
[1:25:58] Praise the name of Allah, but before
[1:26:00] God, there's always a time of
[1:26:02] restoration.
[1:26:05] Praise the name of us. So then she heard
[1:26:08] about it, there was something in her
[1:26:12] that would tell her, I should not do the
[1:26:15] things I'm doing.
[1:26:17] I should not be drinking. I should not
[1:26:19] be on the pro. I should not be a
[1:26:20] prostitute. I should not be smoking.
[1:26:24] Something was still in her but how to
[1:26:27] overcome it
[1:26:29] is what she was facing. She would go to
[1:26:32] this church. She'll try to do this kind
[1:26:34] of thing. She try to do this kind of
[1:26:36] thing. But it was still holding her
[1:26:40] binding her when she heard about brother
[1:26:42] Brham's meeting
[1:26:45] I want to go there.
[1:26:47] And then he said and I looked at her a
[1:26:50] beautiful woman. I thought what wouldn't
[1:26:54] that be a queen for some little tired
[1:26:56] evangelist
[1:27:00] coming in from the field
[1:27:02] go out sweet little wife put her arms
[1:27:07] around him said darling I know you are
[1:27:11] tired
[1:27:13] let us go to paragraph 42
[1:27:17] those big bright eyes looked up to me
[1:27:22] And she said, "Mr. Branham,
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; I've always believed that
[1:27:28] something drove me to do these things
[1:27:32] that I don't want to do.
[1:27:36] It was a turning point.
[1:27:38] Going astray."
[1:27:42] So she was seeking deliverance.
[1:27:46] Praise the name of the Lord. And what
[1:27:48] brings us to church?
[1:27:50] to seek our victories,
[1:27:53] to seek our captivity
[1:27:56] that Lord, this is my weakness.
[1:27:58] Lord, this is where I'm bound.
[1:28:01] Lord, this is the weakness I have. So
[1:28:04] you come, Lord, I need your deliverance.
[1:28:09] Praise the name of our Lord. And so he
[1:28:11] said,
[1:28:13] I said,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; that's a demon. It's a devil power. He
[1:28:19] said, I've always believed it.
[1:28:23] So I said, "Pray again."
[1:28:27] You know, they took time praying.
[1:28:30] But these spirits are stubborn.
[1:28:34] And you may also have a stubborn spirit.
[1:28:39] But you don't give up
[1:28:41] and don't emulate that spirit and just
[1:28:43] rejoice over it.
[1:28:49] Don't be friends with it. It tells you
[1:28:52] go and do this.
[1:28:55] Don't do it. It tells you go and use
[1:28:58] that one.
[1:29:00] Don't do it.
[1:29:02] Whatever the demon forces you to do,
[1:29:06] you reject it. That's how it becomes
[1:29:09] powerless.
[1:29:11] So he said,
[1:29:14] "We will do pray." She got down and
[1:29:17] prayed.
[1:29:19] She looked over at me again.
[1:29:22] I prayed for her and laid hands on her.
[1:29:26] And so she stayed there a while
[1:29:29] and she looked back. She said, "Do you
[1:29:32] believe it is over?"
[1:29:34] I said, "Just keep on praying.
[1:29:38] Praise the name of God." You know when
[1:29:40] you know what you want,
[1:29:42] don't give up. Praise the name of the
[1:29:45] Lord. Keep pressing.
[1:29:48] Keep believing.
[1:29:50] Keep praying. Keep obeying. You know
[1:29:53] where you want to go. You know where you
[1:29:56] want to reach. Praise the name of our
[1:29:58] Lord. Well, she prayed a while longer.
[1:30:03] I was taking plenty of time with her
[1:30:08] just I got the case over till I got the
[1:30:12] case over
[1:30:16] and after a while
[1:30:19] she struck fire
[1:30:24] and when she did she raised up and them
[1:30:28] eyes had changed.
[1:30:30] She said something has happened.
[1:30:33] I said now it is over. You don't have to
[1:30:37] join nothing now.
[1:30:40] Praise the name of our Lord. She's got
[1:30:42] married and got children.
[1:30:45] No more drinking.
[1:30:47] Praise the name of her. She got her
[1:30:50] deliverance.
[1:30:52] She got her healing
[1:30:54] from all those kind of bondage of so
[1:30:57] many years
[1:31:00] wondering so many years.
[1:31:03] bound in many fest.
[1:31:06] Praise the name of our Lord. She was
[1:31:08] delivered.
[1:31:09] And we can also be delivered in whatever
[1:31:12] condition we are in.
[1:31:14] Whatever spirit that troubles,
[1:31:17] it doesn't matter what kind of spirit.
[1:31:21] Praise the name of our Lord. We can be
[1:31:23] delivered from that condition.
[1:31:26] It can be a habit
[1:31:28] which you are not pleased with.
[1:31:32] Praise the name of our Lord. We can be
[1:31:34] delivered from
[1:31:36] whatever condition it could be.
[1:31:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[1:31:42] Satan works out in many ways
[1:31:46] to hold us in bondage,
[1:31:49] to trouble us,
[1:31:51] to hold us in things which are not
[1:31:53] pleasing.
[1:31:56] And you know wounding our spirit
[1:31:59] can come in different forms
[1:32:02] like this girl. It came because of you
[1:32:05] know the condition of rebellion.
[1:32:09] But then you can also be wounded in your
[1:32:11] spirit
[1:32:13] by your brothers persecuting you
[1:32:18] like David.
[1:32:21] His spirit was wounded
[1:32:24] when Saul was persecuting him.
[1:32:28] His spirit got wounded
[1:32:31] when Abselum took over.
[1:32:34] It can happen in any way. It can be a
[1:32:37] situation
[1:32:39] that can come in your life and then you
[1:32:41] get wounded. You become afflicted.
[1:32:45] You are held down.
[1:32:48] It can be an imagination.
[1:32:51] You know you imagine something and as
[1:32:54] you continue imagining that something
[1:32:57] you are bound.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So you can
[1:33:03] be held
[1:33:05] in a condition that is not good.
[1:33:09] But then how do we come out of those?
[1:33:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:33:15] message straight is the gate.
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:22] Brother Brandham had a dream and when he
[1:33:25] had a dream he thought he was going to
[1:33:28] backslide
[1:33:31] because of what the dream was showing.
[1:33:33] So it can be something you interpret
[1:33:38] or you misunderstand the situation
[1:33:42] and then you take the wrong road. So he
[1:33:45] says, "Straight is the gate."
[1:33:48] And when I went into the front room
[1:33:54] and sat down for a while,
[1:33:58] it was about 3:30
[1:34:01] in the morning.
[1:34:04] I got real sleepy.
[1:34:07] I went back. I laid down and I dreamt a
[1:34:13] dream.
[1:34:14] And it was most odd dream.
[1:34:20] And most of all of you know one of the
[1:34:22] managers Jakamoa.
[1:34:26] Most of you know the manager called
[1:34:28] Jakamoa.
[1:34:31] I have known him for years.
[1:34:33] I thought that I was about with a date,
[1:34:41] a girl about 17 years old. And I was
[1:34:47] taking her by the hand,
[1:34:49] leading her up the hill,
[1:34:52] little Jackie. Well, I know her since
[1:34:56] she was just a nursing baby.
[1:35:00] And I was leading up the hill.
[1:35:04] And I went three city blocks up the hill
[1:35:09] leading this girl and we come under a
[1:35:13] big tree.
[1:35:15] And she sat down and I look and I I like
[1:35:19] a lot of the young teenager girls today,
[1:35:24] you know, till she sat down and then she
[1:35:28] took the little skirt, kind of spread it
[1:35:30] and sit down.
[1:35:34] And as young frogs usually look like
[1:35:36] looking at each other,
[1:35:39] she folded her hands
[1:35:41] like this and begin to look towards the
[1:35:44] sky.
[1:35:47] Well, Jack is a very fine little girl.
[1:35:51] Then he said
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; she looked towards the skies and now the
[1:36:04] reflection of the skies was in her eyes.
[1:36:12] Well, I went about 5 ft from her,
[1:36:17] kind of laid down sideways like this
[1:36:20] and got a straw and put it in my mouth
[1:36:27] and begin to chew
[1:36:30] on the straw like this. And I begin to
[1:36:32] think, what am I doing up here?
[1:36:37] Why me? an old man and this young girl.
[1:36:44] Why? I said, I'm married and I have a
[1:36:47] bunch of children and I don't want any
[1:36:50] business up here with this guy.
[1:36:54] And I started to raise up. And when I
[1:36:57] did, a voice came from the tree saying,
[1:37:01] "This is for a sign and for a cause."
[1:37:07] And I woke up and I almost screamed
[1:37:12] a nightmare. I thought I wonder if that
[1:37:16] means
[1:37:18] that I'm going to backslide
[1:37:21] or something happened to me.
[1:37:24] Now you can imagine brother I'm in this
[1:37:26] kind of condition.
[1:37:28] It's a dream. The things you're seeing
[1:37:31] are are not usual.
[1:37:34] You've gone to the hill holding a young
[1:37:37] girl's hand and then you are standing
[1:37:40] there
[1:37:42] and then she's looking at the sky. But
[1:37:44] why am I alone with her? Said maybe I'm
[1:37:47] going to backslide.
[1:37:50] Now if he would only take his own
[1:37:52] understanding,
[1:37:55] he would miss the purpose of that.
[1:37:59] So you get to misunderstanding some
[1:38:01] situations.
[1:38:06] Like sometimes husband and wife may
[1:38:08] misunderstand each other,
[1:38:11] children and parents may misunderstand
[1:38:14] or friends may misunderstand.
[1:38:17] But now what brother Brham did,
[1:38:21] he went and waited on the Lord.
[1:38:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:38:27] said,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; "I thought if I got to use my own mind,
[1:38:36] then I'll get all mixed up.
[1:38:41] So I'll just wait on God."
[1:38:45] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:38:47] we need to handle every in our
[1:38:51] commit to the Lord in prayer.
[1:38:54] Lord, there is this issue that has come
[1:38:57] Lord, there's this challenge that has
[1:38:59] come and then you pray over it. You wait
[1:39:03] on the Lord. He said, I started praying.
[1:39:07] I said, Lord, does this dream pertain
[1:39:11] does this dream pertain to the vision
[1:39:12] just the early part of the night?
[1:39:17] Oh, what does it mean?
[1:39:19] After waiting
[1:39:21] some time, maybe an hour, my wife was
[1:39:25] already up and ready had breakfast.
[1:39:30] Then the voice came back and said,
[1:39:33] "Go to Kingstone
[1:39:36] and you will be told what to do."
[1:39:40] Praise the name of Lord. He had to seek
[1:39:43] assurance.
[1:39:45] And that should be the same thing in our
[1:39:47] lives.
[1:39:49] Praise the name of our Lord. When an
[1:39:50] issue you don't understand,
[1:39:53] put it before the Lord in prayer.
[1:39:56] Like Rebecca,
[1:39:58] praise the name of our God. And even
[1:40:00] Isaac, when the wife was taken 20 years
[1:40:03] without producing,
[1:40:06] he presented the issue before the Lord.
[1:40:10] Lord, help us.
[1:40:12] And now when she conceived
[1:40:14] and then when Rebecca conceived
[1:40:18] there was struggle in her womb.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Now she didn't go to a which doctor
[1:40:25] you know you try to discern what is this
[1:40:27] happening
[1:40:28] my businesses are collapsing.
[1:40:31] Oh you come and make some chams here
[1:40:33] things maybe will change.
[1:40:38] She waited on the Lord and then the Lord
[1:40:41] told her, "You are two nations in you."
[1:40:44] And this the same thing brother Brandham
[1:40:46] is doing.
[1:40:48] Learn to wait on the Lord.
[1:40:51] Praise the name of God. I know some of
[1:40:53] us. We are bound in his situation,
[1:40:57] but we don't have time to speak to the
[1:40:59] Lord.
[1:41:01] When you take time with God,
[1:41:04] it is budget time.
[1:41:10] But you in continuous bondage
[1:41:14] and then you want to budget for God one
[1:41:16] minute,
[1:41:20] five minutes.
[1:41:22] Even when you give him that time, it's
[1:41:24] not 100%.
[1:41:28] You are praying but the radio is on.
[1:41:32] So you are now trying to hear the news.
[1:41:34] Then you pray here, you turn, you just
[1:41:36] twisting like that.
[1:41:39] Like when you go to somebody's office,
[1:41:42] you are seated and he's listening to
[1:41:44] you. You receive a call.
[1:41:50] I'm here in the big man's office.
[1:41:55] You know that kind of condition.
[1:41:58] You're not giving him your time.
[1:42:01] you're not consecrating yourself,
[1:42:04] then how are you going to break some of
[1:42:06] these things?
[1:42:08] But you need time to consecrate.
[1:42:12] Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm under this
[1:42:15] bondage. Lord, I'm under this torture.
[1:42:19] I need to be delivered out of this.
[1:42:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So, he
[1:42:24] waited on the Lord. And then the Lord
[1:42:27] told him, "Go to Kingstone." And then
[1:42:30] you'll be told what to do. And when he
[1:42:33] reached in Kingston, the vision became
[1:42:36] clear
[1:42:38] in paragraph 26. And the vision was
[1:42:43] the little church.
[1:42:45] The girl was a virgin.
[1:42:48] So the girl stood for a church,
[1:42:53] just a child. And that meant the virgin
[1:42:56] the virginity of the church.
[1:43:01] Three city blocks meant three days.
[1:43:08] I would minister
[1:43:10] and taking the little virgin church
[1:43:16] by my ministry
[1:43:18] from where she was on higher in the
[1:43:21] things of God
[1:43:24] until it shook the entire island.
[1:43:29] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:43:31] Bible says, they that wait on the Lord,
[1:43:35] they shall renew their strength. Praise
[1:43:38] the name of our Lord. So it doesn't
[1:43:40] matter what kind of weakness you have.
[1:43:43] It doesn't matter how much you are
[1:43:45] wounded.
[1:43:47] Learn to wait on the Lord.
[1:43:50] No, this is the trouble I'm having. No,
[1:43:53] this is the captivity I'm in. And then
[1:43:56] you yourself You present it before the
[1:43:59] Lord.
[1:44:00] Lord, I desire to be delivered.
[1:44:03] Lord, I desire to be released from this
[1:44:05] kind of pain.
[1:44:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes
[1:44:09] you can misunderstand things.
[1:44:13] Praise the name of our Lord. There was
[1:44:15] also another sister here in the message
[1:44:18] questions and answers
[1:44:21] of 1964.
[1:44:23] It's question 290.
[1:44:26] He says question, "Brother Brandham,
[1:44:29] what shall we do?
[1:44:31] Something has settled over me
[1:44:34] that I cannot break through.
[1:44:38] I dreamt. I was lost in white sand.
[1:44:46] It was getting dark.
[1:44:51] I couldn't find my way.
[1:44:54] This dream has stayed me with me ever
[1:44:58] since last fall.
[1:45:01] Now I am as one groping in darkness.
[1:45:08] Even and my wife were included in my
[1:45:11] dream. My son and my wife were included
[1:45:13] in the dream.
[1:45:17] Now they are also in darkness.
[1:45:20] We are in desperate. We are in
[1:45:22] desperation.
[1:45:24] I believe God will show you what it is
[1:45:28] in our hearts. Now if we are wrong or
[1:45:33] sinning,
[1:45:34] tell us we want to be right.
[1:45:38] Praise the name of the Lord. Just
[1:45:40] something comes
[1:45:42] and then the devil, he wants to get you,
[1:45:45] you know, mixed up.
[1:45:48] Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:45:50] sometimes it can be different situation.
[1:45:53] You hear something which is not correct
[1:45:56] and then you become indifferent to the
[1:45:58] person.
[1:46:02] But you just had something wrong. And
[1:46:05] then you say, I'm told he talked about
[1:46:07] me.
[1:46:09] I'm told he doesn't want me for any good
[1:46:13] bondage. And now you think that by
[1:46:16] isolating yourself
[1:46:19] you are helping yourself
[1:46:23] or maybe you hear somebody has talked
[1:46:25] against you in church
[1:46:28] say I'm no longer coming to church.
[1:46:31] You are doing yourself more harm.
[1:46:35] Ah I don't want that church.
[1:46:38] Then you spend more money traveling long
[1:46:40] distances.
[1:46:43] If sometimes you borrow,
[1:46:46] if you don't have money, I'm going to be
[1:46:48] at home. I'm not coming to that church.
[1:46:54] But how many have talked about you?
[1:46:59] Are you coming to meet them or you're
[1:47:00] coming to meet God?
[1:47:04] And then you get yourself under
[1:47:06] captivity,
[1:47:08] bondage, bondage. And you know there's
[1:47:12] doors
[1:47:13] They will try to look for transfer very
[1:47:15] fast
[1:47:19] but that's not helping the solution.
[1:47:23] So there are sometimes we get
[1:47:25] misunderstanding,
[1:47:28] misinterpretations
[1:47:31] or you misunderstand
[1:47:34] and you make the wrong decision
[1:47:37] and then you get yourself more hurt,
[1:47:41] wounded,
[1:47:43] years of wondering.
[1:47:48] You become a wandering star.
[1:47:51] I'm no longer going to sing with those
[1:47:53] people. I'm no longer going to
[1:47:55] participate in anything.
[1:47:57] You are wounding yourself.
[1:48:00] So now Satan just knows how to
[1:48:03] manipulate
[1:48:07] uses your imagination
[1:48:09] and wants you puts you off.
[1:48:13] So he says, I don't know the lady but I
[1:48:17] just feel if you are here lady
[1:48:20] that here is your trouble.
[1:48:23] You have let something
[1:48:27] happened to you that made you navious.
[1:48:33] Sometimes we let these things come in
[1:48:35] our life.
[1:48:37] Maybe the way you responded to your wife
[1:48:39] or your husband
[1:48:42] and then something you find there's no
[1:48:44] peace there
[1:48:46] or how you handled a certain issue
[1:48:49] there's no peace there. So you let it
[1:48:51] take a hold of you and this what was
[1:48:54] happening to this sister.
[1:48:57] Then he says being in white sands
[1:49:02] now he's interpreting the dream
[1:49:04] represents purity and righteousness
[1:49:09] and you are just letting Satan
[1:49:14] put one over on you
[1:49:19] misinterpreting the situation
[1:49:23] so you take the wrong turn.
[1:49:27] you make the wrong decision.
[1:49:30] Satan taking a hold of you. So he says
[1:49:34] your dream proved that there is nothing
[1:49:36] wrong.
[1:49:38] You are only navvious
[1:49:41] and by doing this and thinking this you
[1:49:45] are making the rest of your family
[1:49:48] navious.
[1:49:52] Now you can imagine it starts from one
[1:49:53] person and then you share your fears
[1:49:59] the imaginations
[1:50:00] and then everybody takes a hold and now
[1:50:04] that demon the devil has used to speak
[1:50:06] those things
[1:50:09] takes a hold of the whole family. So you
[1:50:11] find a darkness is coming also.
[1:50:14] But how did it come from one person
[1:50:18] misunderstanding the situation?
[1:50:22] So then he says
[1:50:24] stop doing it.
[1:50:27] Claim your godgiven right.
[1:50:32] Your dream proves the interpretation
[1:50:34] that you are in white sand.
[1:50:38] Everything is right.
[1:50:40] It's you yourself navious
[1:50:45] and you let one member the family get
[1:50:47] nervous.
[1:50:49] It goes the next member and the next
[1:50:52] member and the first thing you know you
[1:50:55] are all fussing and going on
[1:50:59] and one member family gets kind of upset
[1:51:02] about something.
[1:51:04] It upsets the other and the other and
[1:51:08] the other and the thing you know the
[1:51:10] whole family is upset
[1:51:14] that is Satan.
[1:51:16] Then if one member family member
[1:51:18] rejoices
[1:51:21] let the rest of them rejoice.
[1:51:24] So every one of the family try to do
[1:51:27] that.
[1:51:29] Try each one of you
[1:51:31] children
[1:51:33] to help your papa mama
[1:51:36] mama papa. You try to help your
[1:51:39] children.
[1:51:41] Don't let that gloomy unbelieving spirit
[1:51:44] get around you.
[1:51:49] You are Christians.
[1:51:51] You are born of the spirit of God. You
[1:51:53] are the salt of the earth. You have
[1:51:56] God-given rights.
[1:51:59] And the Bible said, if there be any
[1:52:01] praise, if there be any virtue, think on
[1:52:05] these things. Don't think about the
[1:52:08] wrong thing.
[1:52:11] Praise the name of God. That should help
[1:52:13] us. Not imagine something wrong and then
[1:52:17] the wrong thing you have imagined, you
[1:52:20] are telling this one, telling the other
[1:52:21] one, telling the other one. At the end
[1:52:24] of the day, Satan has taken a hold of
[1:52:26] all
[1:52:28] captivity.
[1:52:30] Praise the name of our Lord. But we just
[1:52:32] need to see that we take our Godgiven
[1:52:35] right.
[1:52:38] Praise the name of our what the Lord has
[1:52:40] promised us
[1:52:42] and then we take that and make good use
[1:52:46] of it.
[1:52:48] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:52:50] Satan
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; uses many things to hurt us,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; to take us off the right track,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; to mislead us,
[1:53:02] Satan
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; desired.
[1:53:06] Praise the name of our Lord, like Jesus
[1:53:08] told Peter that Satan has desired to
[1:53:11] sift you.
[1:53:17] He desire to sift you.
[1:53:20] like wheat. He pushes you this way, then
[1:53:23] this way, then this way, and you have no
[1:53:26] peace. You have no rest. What did Jesus
[1:53:30] tell Peter? But I have prayed for you.
[1:53:34] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[1:53:36] we need to pray for one another.
[1:53:39] We are living in a neuroretic age.
[1:53:43] We need to keep each other in prayer.
[1:53:46] We need to be concerned about one
[1:53:48] another.
[1:53:49] What's my brother going through? What's
[1:53:52] my sister going through? You know, this
[1:53:54] one doesn't have a job.
[1:53:56] See, can he get a job?
[1:53:59] How can he be helped in this country?
[1:54:02] Praise the name of our Lord. So, Satan
[1:54:06] desire to do harm to Job.
[1:54:09] And now the Bible says in the book of
[1:54:11] Job chapter one
[1:54:14] and then verse one.
[1:54:16] There was a man in the land of wolves
[1:54:18] whose name was Job. And the man was
[1:54:21] perfect and upright and one that feared
[1:54:24] God and estued evil.
[1:54:43] And there was born unto him seven sons
[1:54:46] and three daughters.
[1:54:50] His
[1:54:52] substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000
[1:54:56] camels and 500 y of oxen and 500 she
[1:55:01] ashes and very great household. So that
[1:55:04] this man was the greatest of all men of
[1:55:06] the east.
[1:55:34] Now Job did so well.
[1:55:38] The family was okay. The children are
[1:55:40] there. The wealth is there. the great
[1:55:44] honor in the village or in the country.
[1:55:47] Then the devil say I need to access this
[1:55:50] one here.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Started you know that kind of false
[1:55:54] accusation
[1:55:58] and you know the devil is a false
[1:55:59] accuser.
[1:56:01] So we shouldn't be false accusers.
[1:56:05] The Bible says don't react over an issue
[1:56:08] before you hear it.
[1:56:11] So the devil chooses Job.
[1:56:17] Then Satan was telling God that man
[1:56:19] because you've blessed him. That's why
[1:56:22] he worships you. That's why he does this
[1:56:25] kind of
[1:56:27] now. We shouldn't have the same mind of
[1:56:29] Satan.
[1:56:30] I come to church because I'm okay.
[1:56:34] Come to church even when things are
[1:56:35] hard.
[1:56:37] Praise the name of God. Even when your
[1:56:39] prayer is taking long to be answered,
[1:56:43] just keep on coming.
[1:56:45] You know, so Satan
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; was given permission
[1:56:50] to go and destroy whatever Job had.
[1:56:55] He killed the seven sons,
[1:56:58] the three daughters in one day. Then he
[1:57:01] went and destroyed all the animals he
[1:57:04] had.
[1:57:06] And Job was getting all these reports.
[1:57:09] They were telling him this has happened.
[1:57:11] This has happened. This has happened.
[1:57:13] This has happened. Job was wounded.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. No more
[1:57:21] person to call you father.
[1:57:25] No more wealth.
[1:57:28] Nothing completely.
[1:57:30] Wounded spirit.
[1:57:32] But what did Job say?
[1:57:35] Job just worshiped God.
[1:57:38] Lord, whatever I had
[1:57:41] came from you. It has gone back to you.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Glory be to your name. Praise the name
[1:57:47] of our Lord. That should be our stand.
[1:57:51] Not to take the name of the Lord in
[1:57:53] vain.
[1:57:56] You know, trying to accuse God over
[1:57:58] this, trying to blame God over this,
[1:58:01] trying to say all these problems. It's
[1:58:04] because of the church I go to, all these
[1:58:06] problems. No. Praise the name of our
[1:58:10] Lord. Be like Job.
[1:58:13] Just rejoice before the Lord and say,
[1:58:15] Lord, I thank you for everything.
[1:58:18] Glory be to your holiness. Now, the
[1:58:21] devil, he was irritated by that.
[1:58:28] You know, because the devil wants to do
[1:58:29] this
[1:58:31] for you to go away from God.
[1:58:34] But Job never allowed Satan
[1:58:39] to use him. And that should be the same
[1:58:42] thing with us. Don't allow Satan to use
[1:58:45] him.
[1:58:47] Don't allow Satan to make you
[1:58:50] responsible
[1:58:52] for the failure of your family.
[1:58:56] And every trouble it is the husband.
[1:59:00] Every trouble it's the wife.
[1:59:03] Every trouble it's the father.
[1:59:06] Every father it's the mother.
[1:59:09] Don't be the one responsible.
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:13] See that you do everything to the best
[1:59:15] of what you know
[1:59:18] living upright before God.
[1:59:21] So now when Satan failed that
[1:59:24] He said now he's life.
[1:59:27] And so Satan was given opportunity.
[1:59:31] And then he went to Job in Job 2:7.
[1:59:37] So Satan went forth from the presence of
[1:59:39] the Lord
[1:59:43] Job with boils
[1:59:49] from the sole of his feet unto the
[1:59:51] crown.
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:57] and he took a port share to scrap
[2:00:00] himself with
[2:00:03] and he sat upon the ashes.
[2:00:08] Now see the condition of Job.
[2:00:12] He has lost everything.
[2:00:14] Even now his health
[2:00:17] everywhere is itching and painful
[2:00:20] that his fingers
[2:00:23] the nails
[2:00:25] could not soo them.
[2:00:28] He got just you know a broken pot
[2:00:32] started scratching his
[2:00:35] to get some relief.
[2:00:38] Satan getting him in that condition,
[2:00:41] wounding him
[2:00:43] until his wife came to him and said unto
[2:00:46] him, "Do you still retain your
[2:00:49] integrity?
[2:00:52] Trust God and die,
[2:00:56] wounded,
[2:00:58] afflicted."
[2:01:00] What did Job do?
[2:01:03] But he said unto her, verse 10,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; thus speaketh as one of the foolish
[2:01:09] women,
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; what shall we receive good at the hand
[2:01:16] of God and not receive evil
[2:01:24] in all this job sin not with his lips?
[2:01:31] Praise the name of our Lord. He held his
[2:01:33] integrity.
[2:01:36] And that's how you need to learn that in
[2:01:38] every situation
[2:01:40] I shouldn't take the name of the Lord in
[2:01:42] vain.
[2:01:44] But I should learn to say Lord I thank
[2:01:46] you even when I've taken a year without
[2:01:48] a job.
[2:01:50] Lord I thank you that you are keeping
[2:01:51] me.
[2:01:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Lord I
[2:01:55] thank you.
[2:01:57] Even I've taken maybe 10 years.
[2:02:00] or five years, whatever duration you've
[2:02:03] waited for and seems nothing is
[2:02:06] happening, say, "Lord, I thank you that
[2:02:10] you have kept me. You provided for me.
[2:02:13] You fought my battle. You brought me
[2:02:16] this far." Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:02:19] You're not serving God because of
[2:02:20] circumstances.
[2:02:23] You're not serving God because of
[2:02:24] benefit,
[2:02:26] but your heart loves God.
[2:02:29] Praise the name of the Lord. And you say
[2:02:31] there is nothing between me and my God.
[2:02:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Whether
[2:02:37] they have not added my salary
[2:02:39] or the landlord has increased the rent.
[2:02:43] Praise the name of our Lord or whatever
[2:02:45] situation it is. My business is not
[2:02:48] doing well. My farm is not doing well.
[2:02:52] My my my every investment is down.
[2:02:56] Lord, I thank you.
[2:02:58] Praise the name of our Lord. That was
[2:03:00] Job.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Say, "Lord,
[2:03:04] I thank you. He never sinned before
[2:03:07] God."
[2:03:09] You know, whatever he went through
[2:03:10] during that time,
[2:03:13] his heart was still depending upon God.
[2:03:16] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[2:03:18] we need to live.
[2:03:20] Wherever much you've been wounded,
[2:03:23] however much you've been hurt,
[2:03:26] see that you hold the name of the Lord.
[2:03:29] You know, the Bible told us in Proverbs
[2:03:32] 18:10
[2:03:34] that the name of the Lord is a strong
[2:03:37] tower.
[2:03:39] Praise the name of Lord. So when you are
[2:03:41] wounded,
[2:03:43] what do you do? Run into that strong
[2:03:45] tower.
[2:03:47] Praise the name of Lord. And then you
[2:03:49] get comfort there. You get consolation
[2:03:52] there. You know, maybe you are confused
[2:03:54] with things there. You don't know how to
[2:03:57] go about things.
[2:03:59] The Bible says the name of the Lord is a
[2:04:02] strong and mighty town
[2:04:05] and the righteous
[2:04:07] run into it. Praise the name of Lord.
[2:04:10] You run there. Say, Lord, I'm looking
[2:04:13] for my safety. Lord, I'm looking for my
[2:04:16] deliverance.
[2:04:18] That's how Job was handling things.
[2:04:20] Lord, I'm here. I cannot turn either
[2:04:23] side. You are my only hope.
[2:04:27] Praise the name of the Lord because you
[2:04:29] know the end from the beginning.
[2:04:32] He found comfort in the Lord.
[2:04:34] And while Job was going through the
[2:04:36] things,
[2:04:38] his friends spoke bad about him.
[2:04:42] Now you can imagine the situation of
[2:04:44] Job.
[2:04:46] You are wounded.
[2:04:47] Your family is no more. You can't have
[2:04:50] fellowship with your wife.
[2:04:52] He says, "Why don't you cast God?
[2:04:56] The children are dead. Even the close
[2:04:59] friends
[2:05:01] are speaking against you. The wealth
[2:05:04] everything is gone."
[2:05:08] So in Job chapter 19
[2:05:10] and then verse 1 to verse three, then
[2:05:13] Job answered and said, "How long will
[2:05:16] you vex my soul
[2:05:19] and break me in pieces with words?
[2:05:25] [Applause]
[2:05:34] These 10 times have you reproached me.
[2:05:38] You are not ashamed that you make
[2:05:41] yourself strange to me.
[2:05:50] Now you can imagine you are under this
[2:05:52] affliction. You under this affliction
[2:05:55] even your friends you made a mistake.
[2:05:59] You are the one. You are a secret
[2:06:02] sinner.
[2:06:04] Afflicted and sometimes those words can
[2:06:07] afflict you. You get troubled. You don't
[2:06:11] know which way to turn.
[2:06:13] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[2:06:15] just need to look to the Lord
[2:06:18] and say Lord help me in this kind of
[2:06:22] praise the name of our Lord. Now it is
[2:06:24] very interesting
[2:06:26] that the very friends
[2:06:29] who are talking against Job,
[2:06:33] God told Job,
[2:06:36] you pray for them.
[2:06:38] Praise the name of our Lord. And those
[2:06:41] are the solutions.
[2:06:43] They have done bad to you. The solution
[2:06:46] is
[2:06:48] forgive them.
[2:06:50] That's what the Bible say. Now those are
[2:06:53] things the devil doesn't want you to do
[2:06:59] for
[2:07:01] I don't have things to pray for but God
[2:07:03] says pray for them.
[2:07:07] Praise the name of our let us go to
[2:07:10] Matthew chapter 5
[2:07:12] and then verse 43.
[2:07:17] We are looking for the healing of our
[2:07:19] wounded spirit.
[2:07:21] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Job needed healing.
[2:07:27] So the Bible says in Matthew chapter 5
[2:07:31] and then verse 43,
[2:07:36] you have heard that it has been said,
[2:07:39] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[2:07:42] thine enemy.
[2:07:55] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[2:07:59] bless them that curse you, do good to
[2:08:02] them that hate you, and pray for them
[2:08:05] which despitefully use you, and
[2:08:07] persecute you, that you may be the
[2:08:09] children of your father, which is in
[2:08:11] heaven. For he maketh his son to rise
[2:08:13] upon the evil and on the good, and sends
[2:08:16] rain on the just and on the unjust.
[2:08:42] Now he said okay this is what you are
[2:08:45] used to doing
[2:08:47] under normal circumstance you're not
[2:08:50] attracted to a bad person
[2:08:55] but he said now when you come to
[2:08:59] Love your enemies.
[2:09:01] Those who exploit you.
[2:09:06] You've taken a whole month. That man has
[2:09:08] cheated your salary.
[2:09:11] The landlord is chasing you. Your
[2:09:14] children have been chased away from
[2:09:16] school.
[2:09:17] Then he says,
[2:09:19] "Pray for them and praying not to c
[2:09:22] them.
[2:09:24] Lord, may all his business come down.
[2:09:29] says, "Pray for them.
[2:09:32] Wish them good."
[2:09:35] That's how we are healed.
[2:09:38] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[2:09:40] "Pray for them.
[2:09:42] Those who despitefully use you.
[2:09:45] Bless them. Don't c them."
[2:09:50] And that makes the difference.
[2:09:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[2:09:55] go to Mark 11
[2:09:59] and then verse 22.
[2:10:03] Mark 11 and then verse 22.
[2:10:09] The Bible says
[2:10:12] Jesus answering said unto them, have
[2:10:14] faith in God.
[2:10:19] For ver I say unto you, that soever
[2:10:21] shall say unto the mountain, be thou
[2:10:24] removed, and be cast into the sea, and
[2:10:27] shall not doubt in his heart, but shall
[2:10:29] believe that those things which he saith
[2:10:31] shall come to pass, you shall have
[2:10:33] whatever he saith.
[2:10:51] Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever
[2:10:54] things you desire when you pray, believe
[2:10:57] that you receive them, and you shall
[2:10:59] have them.
[2:11:15] And when you pray, forgive if you have
[2:11:19] ought against any, that your father also
[2:11:22] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[2:11:24] trespasses. If you don't forgive,
[2:11:27] neither will your father which is in
[2:11:28] heaven forgive your trespasses.
[2:11:49] Praise the name of the Lord. That's our
[2:11:52] healing.
[2:11:53] You want God to hear your prayers.
[2:11:56] He says, "Forgive."
[2:11:59] You want God to hear your prayers.
[2:12:02] He says, "Pray for them."
[2:12:04] You want God to hear your prayers. He
[2:12:07] says, "Forgive your enemies.
[2:12:10] Have no grudge against anybody."
[2:12:18] And then we need to learn as children of
[2:12:20] God, not have anything evil
[2:12:25] in your heart against anybody. Cuz the
[2:12:28] Bible says, "If possible,
[2:12:32] live at peace with everybody.
[2:12:36] Let them have issues against you.
[2:12:39] Don't have issues against.
[2:12:42] That's how you are released.
[2:12:45] That's how you are delivered.
[2:12:48] Don't take issues against people
[2:12:51] all the time.
[2:12:54] You know there are some people who
[2:12:56] always seek trouble for others
[2:13:00] but you shouldn't be like that. The
[2:13:03] Bible says blessed are the peacemakers
[2:13:08] be a peacemaker
[2:13:10] at home be a peacemaker
[2:13:12] not a person who preaches strife
[2:13:19] when this trying to reconcile the one
[2:13:20] trying to put a wedge between them.
[2:13:26] No, we need to be children of God.
[2:13:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:13:32] back to Matthew chapter 5.
[2:13:34] He says,
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5
[2:13:40] and then we read in verse
[2:13:43] 7,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[2:13:48] obtain mercy.
[2:13:54] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[2:13:56] shall see God.
[2:14:02] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
[2:14:05] shall be called the children of God.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[2:14:17] we are called to be.
[2:14:19] And Job,
[2:14:22] God told Job
[2:14:24] or he told his friends who were talking
[2:14:27] against him in Job chapter 42,
[2:14:33] praise the name of our Lord. Job chapter
[2:14:35] 42
[2:14:37] and then verse 7
[2:14:40] up to verse 10.
[2:14:42] And it was so that after the Lord had
[2:14:45] spoken these words unto Job, the Lord
[2:14:47] said unto Eleph the Temonite, "My wrath
[2:14:51] is kindled against you and against thy
[2:14:54] friends, for you have not spoken of of
[2:14:56] me the thing which is right, as my
[2:14:59] servant Job has done.
[2:15:17] Never never know.
[2:15:27] Now you can imagine when these people
[2:15:29] were talking to Job,
[2:15:32] they were choosing Job. Job, you did
[2:15:35] this. God cannot do this kind of thing
[2:15:38] any way it is you
[2:15:42] think God can do that as they were
[2:15:44] talking against Job
[2:15:47] God says you have talked against me
[2:15:53] it is me you have spoken about
[2:15:56] it you
[2:15:58] are choosing then he told them
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; go to Job
[2:16:04] therefore take unto you now seven
[2:16:06] bulocks and seven rams and go to my
[2:16:09] servant Job and offer up for yourselves
[2:16:12] a burnt offering. And my servant Job
[2:16:16] shall pray for you. For him will I
[2:16:18] accept, lest I deal with you after your
[2:16:21] folly, in that you have not spoken of me
[2:16:24] the thing which is right, like my
[2:16:26] servant Job.
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:17:01] Praise the name of the Lord. He's
[2:17:02] telling them go to Job
[2:17:06] offer your sacrifices
[2:17:08] and then after that he will pray for
[2:17:10] you.
[2:17:12] But they talked about Job.
[2:17:15] They looked at him as a bad person. And
[2:17:18] then Job was not in a good condition at
[2:17:20] all. But then God said, "Go to him. He
[2:17:25] knows how to handle his afflictions.
[2:17:29] Praise the name of our Lord. is not
[2:17:31] going to accuse everybody.
[2:17:34] You know there are people now to choose
[2:17:35] this one.
[2:17:44] And then you bring a wedge.
[2:17:47] The fathers are choosing the children.
[2:17:50] The children are choosing the mother.
[2:17:52] The mothers are choosing the the
[2:17:54] children.
[2:17:56] The wives are choosing the husband.
[2:17:58] Husbands are choosing
[2:18:01] Where is forgiveness there?
[2:18:04] How do you pray for them when you're
[2:18:05] choosing them?
[2:18:09] Maybe you're going to choose them before
[2:18:11] God.
[2:18:13] I want these children to know that I'm
[2:18:14] their father, their mother.
[2:18:19] No,
[2:18:21] forgive.
[2:18:23] Praise the name of Allah and pray for
[2:18:24] them for the good.
[2:18:27] You know, they are parents who now to c
[2:18:29] their children.
[2:18:32] this child
[2:18:34] doesn't understand. You are condemning
[2:18:36] him to that condition.
[2:18:39] But bless as a parent,
[2:18:42] praise the name of our Lord. Bless your
[2:18:44] children,
[2:18:46] bless your family.
[2:18:48] Don't curse.
[2:18:50] Praise the name of our Lord. But you can
[2:18:52] bless.
[2:18:54] You know God was telling Job
[2:18:58] your friend are in trouble
[2:19:00] but I want you to bless them
[2:19:03] because we are called to bless
[2:19:06] like marriage. When the whole country
[2:19:09] was sick
[2:19:11] said go to Abraham my prophet
[2:19:15] prays for you. What is it? God desires
[2:19:19] to bless us.
[2:19:22] God desires to deliver us.
[2:19:24] out of whatever captivity we are in out
[2:19:27] of whatever situation we are in. So now
[2:19:30] they had to go to Job.
[2:19:32] So
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; and
[2:19:37] build that and Zora they went and did
[2:19:41] according to the commandment of God.
[2:19:46] And the Bible says the Lord accepted
[2:19:50] Job.
[2:19:53] God would want to hear your prayer
[2:19:56] for your enemies.
[2:19:58] Praise the name of Lord. He wants to
[2:20:00] hear your prayers for your enemies.
[2:20:03] And out of a true heart,
[2:20:06] he wants you forgiving your enemies.
[2:20:10] If you have issues against your husband
[2:20:13] or against your wife, God wants you to
[2:20:16] forgive them or your children or your
[2:20:20] parents. You have just issues of ages.
[2:20:24] God wants you to forgive.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. I'm not
[2:20:28] taking issues and saying
[2:20:32] no. This is the one
[2:20:35] you need to overcome
[2:20:38] the captivity. So now when Job prayed
[2:20:41] for them,
[2:20:43] the Bible says in verse 10, "And the
[2:20:46] Lord turned the captivity of Job when he
[2:20:49] prayed for his friends also the Lord
[2:20:52] gave Job twice as much as he had before.
[2:21:05] Praise the name of the Lord. You want
[2:21:07] your captivity to be turned away.
[2:21:10] Pray for your enemies.
[2:21:13] Forgive your enemies.
[2:21:15] That's what Job was being told. Pray for
[2:21:18] them in praying for them. Then the Lord
[2:21:21] releases you also.
[2:21:24] Praise the name of our Lord. He released
[2:21:26] Job's captivity.
[2:21:29] So Job had to have a pure heart.
[2:21:33] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[2:21:35] the same thing. He said when you start
[2:21:38] praying,
[2:21:40] you want God to help you in this area,
[2:21:42] you want God to deliver you in this kind
[2:21:43] of situation. He said when you pray,
[2:21:47] forgive.
[2:21:49] There's no negotiation about that.
[2:21:52] Because if you don't forgive, he will
[2:21:54] not hear your prayers,
[2:21:56] you're not going to be healed.
[2:21:59] But if you want to be healed,
[2:22:01] the healing of your spirit,
[2:22:04] forgive.
[2:22:06] Praise the name of our Lord and don't
[2:22:08] take issues against.
[2:22:11] Forgive, pray for them. And that's what
[2:22:15] Job did. He prayed for his friend. He
[2:22:19] prayed for his wife. Praise the name of
[2:22:22] our Lord. And then the Bible says God
[2:22:26] gave Job twice as much as he had.
[2:22:31] He released him from his captivity.
[2:22:35] Praise the name of Lord. And so God
[2:22:38] desires to release every one of us
[2:22:42] out of our broken spirit,
[2:22:45] broken heart.
[2:22:47] Praise the name of our Lord. He wants to
[2:22:49] release each and every one of us.
[2:22:52] And say, Lord, I need to be helped. And
[2:22:56] you don't allow the devil to deceive
[2:22:58] you,
[2:22:59] but just say, Lord, here I am.
[2:23:02] Praise the name of our Lord. As I
[2:23:05] finish,
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; let us go to
[2:23:11] to the book of Jeremiah, chapter 29.
[2:23:19] And then verse 12,
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; he says,
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; "Then shall you call upon me, and you
[2:23:28] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[2:23:31] hearken unto you."
[2:23:39] He says, "You call upon me." We've been
[2:23:42] looking at how you call upon the Lord.
[2:23:45] said, "You pray unto me. You hear what
[2:23:49] I'm telling you
[2:23:51] and you shall seek me and you shall find
[2:23:54] me when you shall search me with all
[2:23:58] your heart
[2:24:01] and I will be found of you, says the
[2:24:04] Lord, and I will turn away all your
[2:24:06] captivity.
[2:24:11] And I will gather you from all those
[2:24:14] nations
[2:24:15] and from all the places whether I have
[2:24:18] driven you, says the Lord, and I will
[2:24:20] bring you again into the place where I
[2:24:23] caused you to be carried away captive.
[2:24:27] Verse 14. Verse 14.
[2:24:57] Praise the name of the Lord. He says, "I
[2:24:59] will set you free
[2:25:02] from every condition and then restore
[2:25:06] you back."
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. We need the
[2:25:09] healing of our spirit.
[2:25:12] We need our victories. We need our
[2:25:14] deliverances.
[2:25:16] If you have something against somebody,
[2:25:19] take it off your heart. Praise the name
[2:25:21] of our Lord. Be free with God. God will
[2:25:25] not hear you. Because that's what the
[2:25:27] Bible says. When you come to offer
[2:25:29] sacrifice and you remember you have
[2:25:32] ought against anybody,
[2:25:35] make it right. Don't pretend about it
[2:25:39] because you're not going to be set free.
[2:25:42] But you need to be released.
[2:25:45] Praise the name of our Lord. Take envy
[2:25:47] out of your heart.
[2:25:50] Take hatred out of your heart. take any
[2:25:53] kind of evil spirit out of your heart
[2:25:56] and say, "Lord, here I am. I need your
[2:25:58] deliverance. I need to be released from
[2:26:00] captivity.
[2:26:02] Praise the name of our Lord." Now, in
[2:26:04] the message, hearing and receiving.
[2:26:08] He says, "Inspire your servants, the
[2:26:11] ministers,
[2:26:13] our gracious and precious brothers,
[2:26:17] the shepherds of the floor that you are
[2:26:20] that have called out and set apart,
[2:26:24] dedicated lives
[2:26:27] to the service. We pray for them Lord
[2:26:31] for they are the men who carry these
[2:26:36] the inkeepers
[2:26:39] that will take these sick people
[2:26:42] of soul and body
[2:26:46] and keep pouring oil and wine
[2:26:51] until they are well.
[2:26:54] It is said in the parable that he gave
[2:26:57] them two pens.
[2:27:02] The one there was for both salvation and
[2:27:05] healing.
[2:27:07] And he said, "If there is anything more,
[2:27:11] I'll come and give it again."
[2:27:16] You know, the that man who was beaten,
[2:27:20] good for the dead,
[2:27:23] they had to take him to the inn.
[2:27:26] And the inn is the church.
[2:27:29] Praise the name of our Lord. That great
[2:27:31] physician is here
[2:27:33] to heal us of our broken hearts, our
[2:27:37] broken spirit, our troubled soul.
[2:27:42] That's why we are here. I said there are
[2:27:44] two pens
[2:27:46] salvation
[2:27:48] and healing oil and the wine
[2:27:53] to revive us to bring us back. Praise
[2:27:57] the name of Lord. Then he said the word
[2:28:01] and the spirit they are both here for
[2:28:04] what? For our deliverance
[2:28:08] to be released from any form of
[2:28:10] captivity that way.
[2:28:13] Praise the name of our Lord. So then you
[2:28:15] have to take it. It is the bomb in
[2:28:18] Gilead.
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:23] And so if the doctor gives you medicine
[2:28:26] and you don't take the medicine, then
[2:28:28] you can't be better,
[2:28:31] but we are here to receive the healing
[2:28:34] of our body. We are here to receive the
[2:28:36] healing of our spirit. We're here to
[2:28:38] receive the healing of our souls. Praise
[2:28:41] the name of our Lord. So you take it and
[2:28:44] say, Lord, help me. Praise the name of
[2:28:48] our Lord. Lord, deliver me out of this
[2:28:50] trap. Lord, deliver me out of this
[2:28:52] spirit. Deliver me out of this habit.
[2:28:56] Praise the name of the Lord. May God
[2:28:58] bless you.
[2:29:00] Amen.
[2:29:02] Let us sing that song, cast your
[2:29:04] burdens. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:29:06] And let us all cast our burdens to the
[2:29:09] Lord
[2:29:11] unreservedly.
[2:29:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Cast all
[2:29:16] your burdens. Cast all your cares and
[2:29:20] Say, "Lord, help me. Lord, deliver me.
[2:29:24] Lord, heal me. Lord, set me free."
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of God.
