[28:40] [Music]
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:50] [Music]
[29:00] [Music]
[29:03] how many of us are Standing on the
[29:06] Promises this morning
[29:08] that's the best time
[29:11] ended on the unfailing world
[29:15] that has been given to us in this time
[29:19] amen amen let's turn to Romans chapter
[29:23] 10.
[29:25] so God willing uh
[29:32] is going to be brother Jones Day
[29:40] we shall give him the money
[29:43] and then he's going to share with us on
[29:46] the world
[29:48] and then he comes back in the evening
[29:52] to do uh you know
[29:55] um to do his voice of good work
[30:01] amen amen so let us all be here
[30:05] and be an encouragement to him
[30:09] he is one of the ministers now in the
[30:12] Nairobi church
[30:15] and is going all over the country
[30:18] as he does his voice of good work
[30:23] so that's the ministry
[30:25] so it will be a blessing to have him
[30:28] with us
[30:30] amen amen you see when it stands in
[30:33] front of this church
[30:35] it is something so small
[30:38] compared to what
[30:41] the church is back home
[30:45] but where two or three are gathered
[30:48] together in my name
[30:50] amen amen so Romans chapter 10 verse 17.
[30:56] example let's pray before we read
[31:00] precious Sovereign
[31:55] to find certain area foreign
[32:27] so then Faith cometh by hearing
[32:32] and hearing
[32:34] by the word of God now
[32:41] the scripture doesn't say fearing
[32:46] from the world
[33:45] you see it is deeper than that
[34:31] so as the message teaches
[34:35] only one messenger for each age
[34:41] receives what the spirit has to say to
[34:44] the Earth
[34:48] and that one messenger
[34:51] is the messenger to the true church
[34:57] so when we say a messenger to the true
[35:01] church
[35:02] then there must be also a false chance
[35:08] so we are not talking about local
[35:11] churches now
[35:14] but we are talking about the true church
[35:19] which is the mystical body of the Lord
[35:21] Jesus Christ
[35:24] he speaks for God and by Revelation
[35:30] to the churches
[35:32] both true and false
[35:35] so the messenger
[35:38] speaks to both churches
[35:57] [Applause]
[36:32] [Applause]
[36:38] because each individual
[36:41] foreign
[37:03] [Applause]
[37:32] [Applause]
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:47] when we talk talk about fearing we're
[37:50] talking Amen in the spiritual aspect
[37:55] it's totally a deeper understanding
[37:59] so each individual of that group
[38:02] is one who has the ability to hear yeah
[38:06] what the spirit is saying by weight of
[38:10] the messenger
[38:13] it's broadcast to Allah
[38:22] according to Revelation
[38:24] because the scripture says
[38:29] meaning that there will be served
[38:33] that will be regarded
[38:36] as they do not have the ears
[38:39] that can listen privilege
[38:43] if you can hear the voice of the spirit
[38:47] you need to give thanks to later
[39:16] [Applause]
[40:19] who is the group getting their
[40:21] Collective revelation
[40:23] foreign
[41:17] cause the mouth to feed with
[41:28] [Applause]
[41:44] [Applause]
[42:15] so it is
[42:20] to catch the revelation of who you've
[42:24] always been from before the foundation
[42:27] of the world this Revelation cannot come
[42:31] by intellectuals it comes by the holy
[42:35] spirit
[42:38] amen amen it's god making it possible
[42:42] for you to catch the Revelation
[42:46] who you've always
[42:50] Foundation
[42:52] you get under the influence of your
[42:54] fearful
[42:55] is
[42:58] you know who knows all things
[43:05] when Jesus came into this Dimension
[43:08] he had come through his fearful
[43:12] and then he had come through
[43:16] and when he came here
[43:34] [Music]
[43:44] and we come into the flesh
[43:48] so when we come into the flesh
[43:51] we disconnect
[43:54] from what we wear before the foundation
[43:57] of the world
[43:59] we cannot remember who we were looking
[44:03] like before the foundation of the world
[44:10] he says
[44:17] to be tried and tested
[44:20] amen amen so there was a man his name
[44:24] was John
[44:25] he was perfect he was right here
[44:31] went through moments of trouble
[44:34] and once you get into moments
[44:37] it's the devil trying to touch this
[44:41] flesh so that he can reach yourself
[44:45] and destroyed
[44:47] thank you
[44:49] so everyone
[44:51] whoever you are when you get into
[44:54] moments of traffic
[44:56] there is always a hard feeling on the
[45:00] inside
[45:00] [Applause]
[45:03] you are saying oh God have mercy
[45:06] oh God help me
[45:11] and you know he got through the this
[45:15] depressed
[45:17] I know but one time I removed God came
[45:20] down to him to remind him
[45:24] that is not a product of Power
[45:27] are you together with me when you get
[45:31] under that stress
[45:36] when you feel you cannot go anywhere
[45:40] amen amen God will always come down to
[45:44] remind you of Who You Are
[46:02] because you didn't come through yourself
[46:07] amen so when we hear the words
[46:12] [Music]
[46:21] are you together with me you get under
[46:24] the influence of your future
[46:27] who knows all things
[46:33] starts breaking forth as Revelation to
[46:36] you
[46:37] are you together with me it breaks forth
[46:41] to you
[46:43] that's why brother brought himself
[46:46] faith is a revelation
[46:48] it's not your man to understand
[46:52] in a revelation
[46:55] that has been given to the inner man
[46:58] so now when you catch that Revelation
[47:02] everything comes to you
[47:04] as a substance
[47:07] a spiritual substance which is in
[47:11] another dimension but waiting to before
[47:17] are you together with me when is it amen
[47:21] amen so in the message there is this
[47:23] America said that we welcome
[47:25] he says then after you recognize what
[47:29] again the very word of God as ego food
[47:35] then you leave
[47:38] you have then been formed
[47:41] into living image of the Living God you
[47:47] had enough you had
[47:49] what you heard from yourself
[47:56] [Applause]
[48:08] [Applause]
[48:12] and hearing by way of yourself
[48:18] are you together with me that's the
[48:21] perfect Faith
[48:23] it's not your common sense
[48:26] but it is something I make it like the
[48:30] Brotherhood here last week
[48:32] he talked about the fall yeah
[48:39] the phone has a SIM card
[48:42] and this SIM card here
[48:45] it connects this phone
[48:48] to the main station Eddie
[48:52] the main station
[49:09] [Applause]
[49:31] [Applause]
[49:35] [Music]
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:54] he's not speaking to your ears
[49:57] Hallelujah
[50:42] [Music]
[50:53] does not
[50:55] apply into human mind
[51:02] is totally far away from there
[51:06] are you together with me because it is a
[51:10] revelation
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:14] when you look at Abraham
[51:17] he doubted
[51:21] about the promise
[51:25] [Applause]
[51:27] about the promise of his own so faith is
[51:31] not positive thinking
[51:36] it's not that
[51:38] because Paul Wanga Paolo who says
[51:43] faith is a revelation
[51:46] because you know it is
[51:50] speaking to you
[51:55] Hallelujah which is
[51:58] so that you can be able to hear him
[52:05] is the one who came down and he says by
[52:09] faith Abraham
[52:12] by faith
[52:14] but if we read ourselves I sing that to
[52:18] us we would not have looked at that as
[52:21] Faith
[52:22] now remember when Peter was in prison
[52:27] and the Saints came together
[52:30] to pray for the release of people
[52:33] we were praying by that Faith
[52:37] are you together with me and then
[52:40] finally the angel came down released
[52:52] and when the girl wrote and looked
[52:55] through the kingdom
[52:57] amen amen
[53:04] foreign
[53:10] [Music]
