[4:07] from your
[4:08] presence in Jesus name amen amen amen
[4:14] let's give the Lord a hand of
[4:18] Praise
[4:20] amen 1 Corinthians
[4:25] 11:7 for a man indeed ought not to cover
[4:29] his
[4:32] head for as much as he the image and the
[4:35] glory of
[4:38] God but the
[4:40] woman is the glory of the
[4:45] man may the Lord had blessing the
[4:47] reading of his
[4:48] word you may be
[4:50] seated so as I
[4:53] said she is the glory of the
[4:57] husband but part two
[5:01] so now in the Holy scriptures in the
[5:05] Book of
[5:08] Esther we see that King made a
[5:14] feast all his
[5:17] princes and his
[5:19] servants the power of pan
[5:23] media the noes and princes of the
[5:28] provinces
[5:30] being before
[5:31] him so he showed the riches of his
[5:35] glorious
[5:37] Kingdom and the honor of his excellent
[5:41] Majesty for 180
[5:45] days which is three
[5:48] months after this he made another party
[5:52] different from that
[5:55] one and this was to all the
[5:58] people that were present in sh and the
[6:02] palace both great and
[6:07] small seven days in the court of the
[6:10] garden of the king's
[6:15] Palace but while the king made that
[6:20] party queen V made a par
[6:24] Feast instead she refused to
[6:28] come King's
[6:31] commandment amen so she refused to come
[6:35] forth to her
[6:37] moment because the
[6:39] wife is the glory of the
[6:42] husband the king had intended to show
[6:44] her
[6:46] forth as part of his
[6:49] glory that he was showing forth in that
[6:53] P because in that
[6:56] batt there was Beauty on displ
[7:00] there was
[7:02] white green blue different
[7:07] hangings like sister Seer knows how to
[7:10] do those
[7:11] things amen
[7:13] purple
[7:16] silvering pillars of
[7:19] marble the beds were of
[7:22] gold and
[7:24] silver upon a pavement of red and
[7:28] blue
[7:34] do you know they drank in vessels of
[7:37] gold they drank Royal Wine in
[7:42] [Music]
[7:44] abundance and the
[7:46] Queen at that time of the display of
[7:50] beauty was supposed to cap up the
[7:53] [Music]
[7:55] party with her beauty but she opted out
[8:00] like a god after all the
[8:04] creation he kept up his
[8:07] creation by bringing forth
[8:10] man he was the pin of his
[8:13] creation because that
[8:15] man was the manifestation of the glory
[8:18] of God to
[8:21] Nature and now this woman here was
[8:25] supposed to C
[8:28] up with
[8:30] Beauty amen so as
[8:33] Christians we have not once but not once
[8:36] or
[8:37] twice but opted
[8:40] out Amen to God given
[8:44] opportuni for us to display the beauty
[8:47] of
[8:49] Holiness but I want to say one day you
[8:53] drop that opportunity for the last
[8:58] time
[9:00] amen you see V was
[9:03] called but she turned it down and that
[9:07] was the last
[9:08] time maybe it was her habit to do things
[9:11] like
[9:13] that when the opportunity comes your way
[9:17] to testify of his
[9:19] goodness or to invite somebody to
[9:22] church go ahead and do it bring them
[9:26] into this
[9:27] presence find every vable
[9:30] opportunity and display the beauty of
[9:34] Holiness are you together with me okay
[9:38] so now I I want to just take a little
[9:42] time and take you to the dedication of
[9:45] the Tabernacle of
[9:47] David when David had brought the Ark of
[9:51] God and set it in the midst of the
[9:55] tent that he had pitched for it and they
[9:59] offered burn
[10:02] sacrifices and peace
[10:04] offerings before God David then in 1
[10:10] Chronicles chapter
[10:12] 16 verse
[10:14] 29 you know David
[10:17] says give unto the Lord the glory do to
[10:21] his
[10:22] name bring an
[10:25] offering and come before Him worship Him
[10:30] in the beauty of his
[10:33] Holiness Hallelujah worship him in the
[10:37] beaut of his
[10:39] H not the statement now
[10:44] am the beauty of
[10:46] Holiness which means that Holiness is
[10:52] beautiful step into it and Worship the
[10:57] Lord in the beauty of Hol
[11:00] so in our subject talking about the
[11:04] woman being the glory of the
[11:07] man the beauty of
[11:09] Holiness is the woman displaying the
[11:13] character of the
[11:15] man and in this
[11:17] angle the bride attaining to the stature
[11:21] of the perfect
[11:24] man are you together with me yes sir now
[11:28] listen here
[11:29] you know she is the
[11:33] glory of the man like Adam was the glory
[11:37] of God to
[11:39] Nature then out of Adam came the woman
[11:43] and the woman was the glory of Adam are
[11:47] you together with me maybe by the grace
[11:49] of God we shall see next time How Eve
[11:55] brought the glory of
[11:57] Adam in the first of the
[12:03] we need to hold the beauty of
[12:06] [Applause]
[12:07] Holiness now listen here all the seven
[12:11] spiritual
[12:13] virtues are the Life of
[12:16] Christ in the
[12:18] bride and
[12:20] virtues are therefore the beauty of
[12:25] Holiness when the presence of the Lord
[12:28] was visible
[12:30] at the dedication of the Temple of the
[12:33] Tabernacle of
[12:35] David that was the beauty of
[12:39] Holiness and when I mean David saw the
[12:43] presence he invited the
[12:46] people to come and worship in that
[12:52] beauty hallelujah hallelujah the
[12:55] presence had stepped
[12:57] down the glory of God was
[13:01] there and he called the people and he
[13:05] says him in the beaut of his
[13:08] Hol amen oh how I desire God would be
[13:15] gracious with the virtues that he freely
[13:18] gives to
[13:19] us when we feel that
[13:23] presence how we need to step into
[13:25] moments of worship
[13:28] sometimes is the time you come
[13:30] to and you feel a presence when that
[13:34] presence is there that's the feeling of
[13:38] the beauty of Holiness you lift up your
[13:41] hands and mention a few words to you are
[13:45] so powerful you are Mighty Lord I feel
[13:48] your presence May the glory of God feel

[13:55] walk under this
[13:56] glory amen yes

[14:04] the blood of Jesus
[14:08] Christ and that brings the faith of
[14:10] Jesus
[14:14] Christ the of Jesus Christ the knowledge
[14:18] of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus
[14:21] Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the
[14:24] godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[14:27] kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of
[14:30] God which is Jesus
[14:34] Christ amen he is the head and
[14:40] controls it's the head that controls the
[14:43] body amen yes sir without the head the
[14:48] body can't do
[14:50] nothing amen and your feet is the
[14:54] foundation
[14:57] faith contr by the head there you are
[15:02] there's the perfect man of God when he
[15:05] possesses these
[15:08] virtues how does he possess this
[15:12] VT amen because the scripture says upon
[15:18] faith
[15:21] upon do you
[15:22] fight to add those virtues to
[15:26] yourself no you don't fight what
[15:29] actually is happening here is saying
[15:32] that upon your
[15:35] faith
[15:37] ivert you are not fighting for it he's
[15:41] giving it he's only saying now
[15:46] addt so you just
[15:49] add these are virtues of
[15:52] Grace which God gives unto
[15:55] us so that we can build ourselves
[16:00] into the living
[16:01] Tabernacle of the Living God then after
[16:05] that he says then
[16:08] God representing his
[16:11] church as a
[16:15] bride representing his
[16:18] church as a bride a woman God represents
[16:23] his
[16:24] church as a bride did you hear that
[16:29] what's the
[16:30] bride the

[16:38] Believer that's what it is you just open
[16:42] up whatever he gives you add whatever
[16:46] you give you add whatever he gives you
[16:50] add after you have added everything then
[16:54] charity which is the love of
[16:57] God comes
[16:59] as the strength as the roof to the
[17:06] structure read stat of a perfect man
[17:09] very
[17:11] well he says after you have laid your
[17:16] foundation you find
[17:19] virtue it to
[17:22] Faith and he says that's your first
[17:27] column which means all these others are
[17:31] also
[17:34] walls knowledge is a
[17:36] wall Temperance is a war godliness is a
[17:40] war everything is a war then together
[17:44] you make a six sided
[17:46] house because everything keeps coming
[17:49] down to
[17:50] faith and charity CS you
[17:55] up is the strength of all these things
[17:59] when you build a house and you don't C
[18:02] it amen it is not strong so the beauty
[18:07] of Holiness is a
[18:10] presence that's the beauty that came
[18:14] down to the fruit of Mount
[18:17] HB when God was meeting
[18:20] Moses that's the beauty of
[18:22] Holiness hallelujah hallelujah God
[18:25] empting himself in
[18:27] his and when he EMP himself into his
[18:32] bride then that bride becomes the beauty
[18:36] of the husband which is Christ and when
[18:40] you impart on the revelation of the
[18:44] word into your wife you love her you've
[18:48] imparted a beauty of
[18:51] Holiness and then she
[18:53] becomes Hallelujah the glory of the HB

[19:00] is the prophet say we thank thee for
[19:05] those who have been
[19:08] called are you called
[19:15] out amen amen you
[19:18] said that the ones that escape in that
[19:24] day the branch of the

[20:00] clean holy spirit filled
[20:05] people living for you by your grace
[20:08] there there are
[20:12] this amen so when the Bride Comes to the
[20:16] level God becomes proud of
[20:20] her and therefore moves forward to
[20:24] display her
[20:26] beauty which V
[20:31] refused
[20:34] Queen was called I'm displaying all
[20:38] Beauty in my
[20:40] kingdom and you are all that I am doing
[20:43] this
[20:45] for you are the
[20:47] queen come and I display your
[20:51] beauty queen V
[20:54] refused she was the
[20:57] glory of the king
[20:59] but she refused to come
[21:01] out she could not come to her
[21:06] adoption to show the beauty of
[21:10] Holiness are you together with me so ver
[21:14] thought that her
[21:17] looks was her
[21:19] beauty but the beauty of the
[21:22] church is the character of the
[21:26] people amen that's the beauty of the
[21:29] church is not this building here but the
[21:33] character of the
[21:35] people is the beauty of the church so
[21:40] kingas was calling the
[21:43] queen come and I show you
[21:46] forth let me show forth your
[21:51] character but when she
[21:53] refused she displayed her
[21:57] character
[22:00] when the political son worked under his
[22:04] father he had a great show of
[22:08] success because he was putting
[22:11] everything I mean because he was putting
[22:17] into place all the instruction from the
[22:22] father he was a great
[22:25] worker and he said now father give me
[22:30] also what belongs to
[22:32] me and I'll go in the next
[22:35] city and I also put up my
[22:39] f her success I mean his
[22:43] success he did not know was the
[22:46] instruction of the
[22:48] father that he was working
[22:51] under so when he was given the you know
[22:56] part of the farm
[22:59] and was transferred to another
[23:02] city and he reached there he thought he
[23:06] would
[23:07] work and display his
[23:10] glory in the absence of the father but
[23:14] he discovered that the F was going
[23:19] down his
[23:21] might was the
[23:23] father are you together with me his
[23:26] might was the father in the absence of
[23:29] the father his F could not
[23:33] Prosper are you together with me so this
[23:36] boy here was the glory of his
[23:41] father in the absence of his father the
[23:45] glory would
[23:47] diminish amen when that son was strictly
[23:51] under the
[23:53] father that was the beauty of
[23:56] Holiness but when he stepped out
[23:59] he had stepped out of the
[24:01] channel of the light so he had no light
[24:05] to
[24:07] shine because we finished at the
[24:10] not amen when the son is the father and
[24:16] the mo is the church are you together
[24:20] with amen but then when this boy here
[24:24] who is the image of the church walked
[24:27] away
[24:29] from under the ray of the
[24:33] sun he had nothing to
[24:39] reflect are you together with me we used
[24:42] to do some
[24:45] experiment you get something which is
[24:47] very
[24:49] shiny and then you put it in front of
[24:51] the
[24:53] light and then this light would come and
[24:56] EIT
[24:57] here and then it would light over
[25:00] there so this person here this
[25:04] miror amen did not have the power of the
[25:09] light the power of The Light Came From a
[25:12] Certain
[25:14] Source the mirror just redirected the
[25:20] light that's the Church of Jesus
[25:24] Christ we must stand in the angle
[25:29] of where the light
[25:32] strikes and when the light
[25:34] strikes then the
[25:37] mirror which is the church reflects that
[25:42] light are you together with me then this
[25:45] mirror here is the
[25:48] glory amen of the source of the
[25:52] light hallelujah hallelujah that's how
[25:54] it is between the Sun and the Moon
[25:59] the moon does not have its own
[26:02] light the moon has the the light from
[26:05] the
[26:07] Sun so in the absence of the
[26:10] sun then the moon would
[26:13] Shine the Light which she has received
[26:16] from the
[26:18] son are you together with me so when the
[26:22] boy the
[26:24] prodal went away from the Chanel of the
[26:29] son he had no
[26:32] life when we turn away from the CH of
[26:35] the light the Lord Jesus Christ we have
[26:39] no life to
[26:41] reflect we are the glory of the sun when
[26:47] we stand in the angle of the
[26:54] sunlight you should not get in an obure
[26:59] angle and you still expect that you are
[27:02] going to shine the
[27:04] light when you are not drinking in the
[27:07] light we must receive the light of the
[27:11] Sun for us the moon the church to be
[27:16] able to have something to
[27:18] refle Hallelujah Hallelujah now back to
[27:22] this
[27:24] queen she was groomed by the king
[27:28] [Music]
[27:30] Amen to be his
[27:32] pride and not her own
[27:36] glory to groom means to
[27:40] tut to coach to
[27:43] train amen we don't go through tutorship
[27:47] of the Holy
[27:51] Ghost to enhance our own
[27:55] pride no sir we are not the ones who are
[28:00] being
[28:01] manifested it's the glory of God that
[28:04] shines to us that gives us the
[28:08] opportunity to manifest the
[28:11] life hallelujah hallelujah the beauty of
[28:14] Hol must be seen in
[28:18] the amen the glory
[28:21] of was the
[28:23] position that the king had placed her
[28:27] in and when she was put out of that
[28:31] position for that reflect the king's
[28:35] Glory she was not hard of
[28:39] anymore what was her end because she was
[28:43] not in the
[28:44] channel of that light so she had nothing
[28:49] to
[28:50] reflect hallelujah hallel praise the
[28:53] Lord the song leader sang here that this
[28:57] real light of M
[28:59] I will let it
[29:00] sh Hallelujah because he was standing in
[29:04] ch with the word so the
[29:08] same goes in the outside
[29:11] world that every
[29:14] woman amen because ver was beautifying
[29:20] herself for
[29:22] what she was called to display the
[29:27] beauty and she
[29:29] refused now what were you beautifying
[29:31] yourself
[29:33] for it's the same thing that goes on in
[29:36] the
[29:37] world that every woman tries to beautify
[29:43] herself for the
[29:45] man uhuh for a
[29:49] man the outside
[29:52] world she wants to be
[29:55] appreciated but the problem is is that
[29:58] she is only reverse
[30:03] principal because the
[30:05] principal the woman is the glory of the
[30:11] husband but this woman here she's
[30:16] trying to shine her
[30:18] glory for every
[30:23] man that's the problem she might shine
[30:28] she must
[30:29] share the glory of her
[30:34] husband you see what I mean that's what
[30:37] it is so a man a super man will learn
[30:42] how to design his
[30:46] wife
[30:47] Hallelujah because she is
[30:51] supposed to reflect his
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:56] glory but she got go to the
[30:59] shop and buys this
[31:03] shoe she's beautifying
[31:05] herself forever
[31:11] man because the man a old ghost
[31:16] man would feel it good for
[31:19] her to have a decent
[31:23] shoe but when she chooses her
[31:26] own and she's walking like falling to
[31:29] the
[31:33] front she's
[31:36] playing to the gallery of every
[31:41] man she's trying to sh her own
[31:45] glory for every man but she must
[31:49] shine the glory of her
[31:54] husband when she has those kind of loose
[31:57] cuts
[32:00] and then the breast are
[32:02] out she's trying to present
[32:06] herself own
[32:08] glory to every
[32:13] man let's go to Second Kings
[32:16] here chapter
[32:19] 9 do you love

[33:15] [Applause]
[33:18] to whose glory is she trying to
[33:22] be for every
[33:26] man but the
[33:28] wife is the glory of her
[33:34] husband and Je entered in the
[33:39] gate she
[33:41] said listen to the words of
[33:46] Jezebel had
[33:48] Z peace who slew his
[33:56] master
[34:01] was a
[34:02] king who only ruled for seven
[34:07] days by killing king
[34:10] Ella so you see that's the
[34:14] problem of
[34:16] failure to point at
[34:19] ourselves and we keept seeing the
[34:21] mistakes of
[34:23] others did you hear what I say who is
[34:27] saying
[34:28] this it is
[34:30] Jezebel she has groomed
[34:33] herself Amen to
[34:37] catch but je does not buy the
[34:42] idea and now immediately she turns
[34:47] around because she knows that je was
[34:52] going to put her to death and she says
[34:55] did Z have peace the one who killed his
[35:04] master
[35:06] now
[35:08] Jezebel is
[35:11] wondering she's she's trying to bring to
[35:15] to to
[35:20] notice that je should not put her to
[35:24] death did have peace
[35:28] je did not ask her did you have peace
[35:33] when you
[35:36] killed you see what I
[35:41] mean you know she put to
[35:46] death but now when it comes to
[35:50] her she's telling did Z
[35:53] [Music]
[35:55] peace after killing his master
[35:58] and She's forgetting that she did the
[36:02] same now let me tell you
[36:05] ministers these
[36:07] pits should be used
[36:13] properly you don't get in a
[36:16] pulit to crucify
[36:19] [Music]
[36:20] people when you get to the pulit you
[36:24] Minister knowing that the word on you as
[36:29] it on
[36:31] others are you together with me yeah you
[36:34] are subject to the
[36:36] word the same way those people you are
[36:39] talking to are subject to the
[36:42] word you don't take the word and use it
[36:45] in a onesided
[36:50] form so is
[36:52] Jezebel Jezebel
[36:54] religion will focus on others
[36:58] preaching the gospel to people are
[37:01] thousand miles
[37:03] away you are just talking about them and
[37:07] you are not caring about your people and
[37:12] yourself I'll give you another
[37:15] example Mary
[37:17] Magdalene shared about
[37:19] Christ being
[37:21] invited into the house of Simon the
[37:26] leper and she took her alabaster box of
[37:30] oil to impress the
[37:34] house where the dignitaries were going
[37:37] to
[37:38] be she was a very well known
[37:44] woman but on the other angle she was an
[37:48] evil
[37:50] woman upon whom all the Cardinal spirits
[37:54] of evil
[37:56] convened
[37:59] and gave her a
[38:00] nature she always took her alaster box
[38:03] of
[38:05] oil and when people were not
[38:09] attending she would do a little bit of
[38:13] sprinkle and the alaster
[38:16] oil will make you look where it is
[38:18] coming
[38:20] from so she knew how to trap the
[38:24] men she carried the alabaster box of oil
[38:28] if they are not
[38:30] attending she would just remove the lead
[38:32] a
[38:38] little that was
[38:41] Mary but she had the spirit of
[38:44] Pride she had the spirit of
[38:46] B she had the spirit of
[38:49] unclean she was
[38:51] filthy she was
[38:53] vulgar she had
[38:56] emulations
[38:58] she the prophet the one who was able to
[39:01] discern
[39:03] her before she got
[39:06] converted and saw those seven spirits
[39:08] upon her life she always gathered with
[39:12] the cream of the
[39:15] society back and forth she would do an
[39:18] alabaster
[39:20] secret and the people
[39:23] would oh you see alaster oil
[39:28] was a stand out kind of
[39:31] oil it was a
[39:34] mix of several expensive oils
[39:38] together but when she entered in there
[39:42] she was
[39:43] struck by a unique
[39:46] presence that humbled her arrogant
[39:50] Spirit the presence of the Lord will
[39:54] always disarm
[39:56] us
[39:58] she just didn't
[40:00] know but there was a certain form of
[40:04] presence and she felt this place is
[40:08] different and she was feeling like the
[40:11] power in
[40:13] there wouldn't allow her to use the
[40:15] alabaster
[40:18] oil she starts to look
[40:20] around and she saw a man with shag
[40:25] hair this man here had that fet and his
[40:30] face was so sticky from
[40:33] sweat but yet there was something around
[40:37] her that she would not
[40:40] realize she started keeping eyes on
[40:44] him the more dignitaries were
[40:48] around because in the old
[40:51] days when a man arranges a
[40:54] party he has to know the number of
[40:56] people he has
[40:59] and then he would make sure he makes the
[41:02] same number of change of
[41:04] [Applause]
[41:06] garments that when the people would come
[41:09] to the B they would have a fruit washing
[41:13] flanking they right there at the the
[41:17] door because they used to
[41:20] move in the
[41:22] wilderness Palestine was a
[41:25] Wilderness amen amen and now they would
[41:28] walk and the sand would stick in those
[41:33] feet and stick in there and then they
[41:37] would get so
[41:38] wet from their
[41:40] sweat because it was hot
[41:44] place and so they would go they would
[41:47] give a
[41:49] bath and now they would change their
[41:52] clothes they would get the
[41:54] perfumes they would be given where to
[41:57] see
[41:58] but then this Mary
[42:01] M he sees this man here he has not been
[42:05] attended to when he turned a little
[42:09] further he saw another
[42:12] bunch of 12 men that were SE near them
[42:17] he wondered what kind of people are
[42:21] this listen
[42:23] now she realizes it was Christ
[42:28] and she opened the alabaster
[42:31] box not for herself this
[42:35] time but to pour on the feet of the
[42:38] master and clean the
[42:41] feet with her
[42:44] hair she
[42:45] realized this is my
[42:48] maker she realized the power coming from
[42:52] this man would speak me out of existence
[42:58] this power here would speak anything it
[43:05] existence but when she did that the
[43:09] spirit of
[43:14] judgment came from Simon and his
[43:17] friends if this man was a
[43:21] prophet he would have known that this
[43:24] woman touching him is a woman of ill
[43:31] Fame but they are the ones who had
[43:34] invited
[43:38] her you see what I mean so listen now
[43:42] it's the spirit of
[43:44] judgment you fail to look at your
[43:48] condition and you judge a man in the
[43:52] condition this man if he was a prophet
[43:56] he would the kind of man that was
[43:58] touching
[43:59] him but the same
[44:02] man Simon was a
[44:05] leper and the law did not even allow him
[44:10] to meet together with other
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:16] people this is how the ministers are
[44:19] they've got all kinds of
[44:21] problems but they can set on one
[44:26] man
[44:37] me this
[44:39] [Applause]
[44:44] one you see what I mean before you
[44:49] shoot look at
[44:51] yourself Jezebel should have not judged
[44:56] zy
[44:58] who killed a she equally needed the
[45:02] grace because she
[45:05] killed but she covers up her
[45:08] condition and then
[45:11] attacks I mean she attacks
[45:15] je you understand what I mean so back
[45:18] Jezebel and
[45:20] [Music]
[45:21] Je and as je entered
[45:25] in the
[45:27] gate she
[45:32] say who his
[45:36] master and
[45:38] Je lifted up his face to the
[45:42] window and say who is on my
[45:46] side who and they looked out he to him
[45:52] two or three
[45:55] unics and say
[45:57] throw her down so they threw her down
[46:02] and some of her blood was sprinkled on
[46:05] the wall and on the
[46:08] houses and he thr her under
[46:11] foot amen she done the
[46:15] beautification to catch the attention of
[46:20] je listen now the
[46:23] wife is the glory of the husband
[46:27] whatever she
[46:29] does however she designs
[46:33] herself the husband needs to
[46:37] approve you see what I mean because
[46:42] she is his
[46:46] glory amen let's go to First Peter
[46:51] 31 are you still there this
[46:53] evening amen now listen likewise the
[46:59] wives be subjection to your own
[47:03] husband that if any obey not the
[47:08] word they also May without the word be
[47:13] one by the conversation of the
[47:19] word meaning that the subjection of a
[47:24] wife ministers to the man
[47:28] amen who is not a
[47:31] Believer while they behold your chest
[47:34] conversation coupled with
[47:39] fear so your
[47:43] husbands will
[47:46] watch your
[47:48] confession not here your
[47:51] confession but watch as you live through
[47:56] your confession
[47:59] amen who ading let it not
[48:04] be this is where the point is who ading
[48:09] let it not
[48:10] be that out
[48:13] ading plating the
[48:16] hair and of wearing of
[48:19] God and of putting on of
[48:22] Apper but let it
[48:25] be that Any Man of the
[48:28] heart in that which is not
[48:33] corruptable even the hament of a Meek
[48:36] and qu
[48:38] spirit in the sight of
[48:41] God of great
[48:43] price for after this
[48:48] manner in the old
[48:51] time the holy women
[48:54] also trusted in God
[48:58] adoring
[49:00] themselves being in
[49:03] subjection to their own
[49:06] [Music]
[49:08] husbands he's saying that putting on
[49:11] expensive oper is
[49:14] okay but that's not what will win your
[49:20] husband you are going to win your
[49:24] husband by adoring your inner
[49:28] man with
[49:30] submission much as you could dress your
[49:33] outward
[49:35] person with great
[49:38] appr when it comes to wife ministering
[49:41] to a
[49:43] husband let every
[49:46] action come from the inner man and when
[49:49] it comes from
[49:51] the
[49:55] that's brother Bram in the message Look
[49:59] Away to
[50:01] Jesus he says you women as you serve
[50:04] your husband you serve
[50:08] God so whatever you are
[50:10] doing you are doing a service to
[50:14] God now through her life's
[50:18] journey Jezebel had no light to
[50:24] reflect she was wife
[50:27] to
[50:29] husband so her
[50:32] beauty was her own
[50:35] mind Ahab was an extinguished
[50:40] light God have
[50:47] mercy
[50:49] extinguished turn around
[50:52] human and tell your friend God forbid
[50:58] I should not
[51:00] be an extinguished
[51:05] light I should not
[51:08] be an extinguished
[51:11] light my wife must have
[51:16] something to take from me and be able to
[51:20] reflect my
[51:22] glory but the
[51:24] right and
[51:27] his character that you reflect from the
[51:31] major
[51:32] light so in the ab of the
[51:36] word jeel put on a
[51:41] light amen which is a self
[51:46] beautification husbands must guide their
[51:50] wives in their
[51:53] beautification whether
[51:55] natural
[51:57] spiritual because she is going to be
[52:00] your
[52:03] glory husbands must have something
[52:07] real that can spark a
[52:10] light Amen to their words husbands must
[52:14] be students of the
[52:16] world they must
[52:19] light the
[52:21] candle which is their own
[52:25] words
[52:27] amen husband's
[52:32] light must be seen shining in the
[52:36] hall
[52:38] amen it must be seen shining in the
[52:42] hall the
[52:43] man is the glory of God is that right
[52:49] and he must stay under that Glory
[52:52] because the wife must have some glory to
[52:56] tap
[52:59] or else she will have nothing to
[53:03] reflect listen Adam in the Garden of
[53:07] Eden carried the glory of
[53:10] God before all
[53:13] nature he led nature the same way the
[53:18] Holy Ghost leads a
[53:20] Believer he was the glory of
[53:23] God in the garden he was the link
[53:27] between God and
[53:32] nature therefore God had to impart
[53:36] enough glory to
[53:40] Adam he had to give him enough
[53:43] glory for the animals to
[53:46] see the glory of God so the
[53:50] image and
[53:52] likeness made Adam to carry the glory of
[53:55] God around him
[53:59] let us make m in our image and likeness
[54:07] Hallelujah that was the glory of
[54:11] God that he had given to the
[54:14] man and when the man walked in the
[54:17] garden they saw the glory of
[54:20] God because he was the
[54:23] likeness and image of God are you
[54:26] together with me yes sir praise God so
[54:31] in First
[54:32] Corinthians chapter 11 and verse three
[54:37] listen to what Paul
[54:38] say but I would have you
[54:42] know that the head of every
[54:45] man is Christ and the head of the woman
[54:50] is the man and the head of Christ is God
[54:55] so now this is the Divine
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:00] ranking God Christ man wom so it means
[55:07] that Christ had a
[55:11] headship meaning that Christ was the
[55:15] mind of
[55:17] God hallelujah hallu and when he come
[55:21] here amen the man had to tap into him
[55:27] that now the man becomes the mind of
[55:31] Christ amen in order for him to have
[55:35] a and afterwards then this man here
[55:39] after he has imparted his own God has
[55:42] imparted Christ has imparted his mind to
[55:45] to
[55:47] man then the
[55:49] man becomes the glory I mean of Jesus
[55:53] Christ and the woman Taps into him
[55:57] God Christ man
[56:03] woman that's why when Jesus
[56:06] came he says I came in my father's
[56:15] name I brought a glory to
[56:20] manifest I am the glory of God here on
[56:25] Earth in 176 of
[56:29] John he says I have manifested thy
[56:34] name I manifested thy
[56:37] character I manifested thy
[56:40] nature I manifested th
[56:43] Glory I lived your life for them to tap
[56:50] into hallelujah hallelujah Christ was
[56:54] the brightness
[56:57] of God's glory and the express
[57:01] image of his person he was our example
[57:07] se he was the
[57:10] expression of the glory of God and under
[57:14] the same token the woman would be the
[57:18] expression of the glory of the
[57:25] man the man must impart this glory to
[57:29] his
[57:30] wife by the
[57:32] word amen he should be a bright
[57:37] light by the word that his wife could
[57:41] tap into that
[57:43] light amen n

[1:05:41] here will you tap into the Christ Light
[1:05:45] tonight and once you tap into the Christ
[1:05:49] Light then that light will spread to
[1:05:53] your
[1:05:54] wife and the character of your wife will
[1:05:58] become the glory of the
[1:06:01] man you need to take something home with
[1:06:05] you for your wife to tap
[1:06:08] into amen so once the husband Taps into
[1:06:11] that light
[1:06:14] tonight then charity will have stepped
[1:06:17] into your
[1:06:18] family and that charity will become the
[1:06:22] bond of your
[1:06:24] marriage
[1:06:27] nature submitted to that
[1:06:30] logos the theop charity before the fall
[1:06:36] charity submitted but after the fall
[1:06:40] nature fell from the love
[1:06:44] Covenant and then subjected to
[1:06:51] fear have you heard it come on now are
[1:06:55] you here
[1:06:57] before that all the animals would come
[1:07:01] to Adam and would bow before
[1:07:05] Adam before the fall but after the fall
[1:07:10] we see that it continued a little
[1:07:13] bit that they were even able to enter
[1:07:17] into the Ark of
[1:07:18] Noah by their
[1:07:21] own but after the
[1:07:24] flag the Covenant of Love escaped those
[1:07:28] creatures right now when a snake sees
[1:07:32] you if it doesn't bite you you will kill
[1:07:41] it you see what I mean I'm trying to
[1:07:44] bring something here in the Book of
[1:07:47] Genesis chapter 9 verse two after the
[1:07:51] fall After the flood and the fear of you
[1:07:57] and the dread of you shall be upon every
[1:08:00] beast of the
[1:08:02] earth that's the Fallen
[1:08:06] man his
[1:08:08] fear will be upon every be of the
[1:08:12] field so when a man falls from the love
[1:08:17] Covenant upon which the Christian
[1:08:19] marriages are
[1:08:23] founded his wife
[1:08:26] and children are
[1:08:29] downgraded to the Covenant of the
[1:08:34] Beast they will be afraid of
[1:08:40] you when you come into the
[1:08:44] house everybody scatters into the
[1:08:49] corner and the wife is almost crawling
[1:08:53] on her knees
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] fall darkness in the family no light to
[1:09:02] T did you hear that she will
[1:09:06] cry your wife cries together with the
[1:09:10] creation for the adoption of the sons of
[1:09:13] God now fear does not Bond a
[1:09:20] marriage but perfect love from the
[1:09:24] husband cast out

[1:21:33] darkness was the light of Malachi
[1:21:37] 4 in the evening
[1:21:40] time so that the bride may find some
[1:21:45] light to help her walk out of
[1:21:49] L into the
[1:21:53] bridge okay
[1:21:55] listen here brother Bram says recall
[1:21:59] that in the first
[1:22:00] age it was almost a full of the
[1:22:05] Church of
[1:22:07] Truth yet there was a light error a
[1:22:11] little
[1:22:11] error called the Deeds of the
[1:22:15] Nikes that kept the circle from being
[1:22:19] full when then in the next
[1:22:22] age more Darkness croped
[1:22:26] until the B of light glowed
[1:22:29] less and darkness covered more of the
[1:22:33] circle in the third age it was eclipsed
[1:22:38] still still
[1:22:41] more and in the fourth age which was the
[1:22:45] Dark
[1:22:46] Ages the light had all but
[1:22:50] gone now what think of this the church
[1:22:55] shines in the reflected Light of
[1:22:58] Christ he's the
[1:23:01] son the church is the
[1:23:05] moon th this or of
[1:23:11] light is the
[1:23:16] Moon it had decreased from almost full
[1:23:23] moon in first age to Sil in the
[1:23:29] fourth but in the fifth
[1:23:32] age it began to
[1:23:35] grow in the
[1:23:37] 60th it took a great step to grow
[1:23:42] forward in part of the seventh
[1:23:46] age it was still
[1:23:49] growing when
[1:23:51] suddenly it
[1:23:53] stopped and way to almost
[1:23:58] nothing so that instead of
[1:24:02] light it was the Blackness of
[1:24:08] apostasy
[1:24:11] amen and at the end of the age it had
[1:24:15] ceased to
[1:24:17] shame for Darkness had taken
[1:24:21] over Christ was now outside of the
[1:24:27] church
[1:24:29] H are you together so
[1:24:33] Christ the husband of the
[1:24:37] church was
[1:24:40] out because the
[1:24:44] Moonlight which is the
[1:24:48] reflection it had weighed out
[1:24:52] completely but in the evening time
[1:24:55] it shall be
[1:24:57] light the light stepped back in
[1:25:01] again by the ministry of Malachi
[1:25:05] 4 amen there was enough light by his
[1:25:11] ministry to show the church how to get
[1:25:15] out of
[1:25:16] laia and come into here into the bridge
[1:25:21] between the ages and Eternity
[1:25:24] that's where the church
[1:25:27] is what has brought us
[1:25:30] there is the light
[1:25:34] himself to walk into the darkness of the
[1:25:38] church so in the evening time we took in
[1:25:42] enough light to shine in the
[1:25:46] darkness Hallelujah and then you were
[1:25:49] able to come
[1:25:50] out and that light is still with the
