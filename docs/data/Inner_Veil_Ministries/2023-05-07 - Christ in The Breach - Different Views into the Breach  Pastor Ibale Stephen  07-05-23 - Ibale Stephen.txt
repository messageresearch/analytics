verse 1 and 2. before we read let us prayer sovereign we want that you may take your word but but you and speak to he that has an ear for you and I believe Lord we have heard your voice you've given us the grace to have an ear once you speak into the ear this morning you may plant seeds of life that will help us to go through this turmoil last times we commute our hearts into your hands as they receive from you in Jesus name amen amen so Revelation chapter four and then after that we shall go to Matthew chapter 13. he says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven a door was opened in heaven origin John doesn't sign was in heaven but he says I looked and the door was opened in heaven I think you understand that he just got into Dimensions he was in the spirit and he was given a special Grace to see things Beyond Time amen Amina and the first voice which I heard is talking about the voices of the trumpet which was in Revelation chapter one he says and the first voice which I heard of a trumpet talking with me which said and that will show the things which must be Hereafter everyone immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven [Music] and one sat on this room may the Lord that blessing the reading of Israel Yama so for a title today the different views into the bridge Indo of course the continuing Services Christ in the bridge amen Amina now when you have something precious something which is so valued you put it on the sale wherever you put it in a Cupboard and lock it watch it or you put it in a house and you lock Ed because it is valued you keep it under a seal which is the most you know greatest book of the book I mean of the Bible is the Book of Revelation because it's the winding up of all the work and we want to know how we are ending up from Genesis and so there is a lot of special things foreign so that's why Giovanni you should always pray or he knocks everything depend on him so that the seals in Revelation could release the revelation of what God is doing in their time amen amen do you love him so I want to go with you into the Book of Matthew chapter 13. and this is the principle as Jesus you know lays it down there yes and the disciples came and said that to him why speak as thou unto them in The Parables he was speaking Parable after party or foreign they would start speaking any problem that means he was not speaking to those people hallelujah and I want to see he that is the one whom the Lord he says they give this scriptures Whoever has to him shall be giveness [Applause] [Music] foreign will always wait for God to break the Revelation before him that's why we are here that while the pastor speak amen you just spread the wholeness to break for Revelation because that's what saves you amen and in them is fulfilled with the prophets of Isaiah which he says [Music] and shall not understand you shall see and shall not proceed for the people's heart is waxed gross and their eyes foreign so he says I won't spend all my time when God gives me food cartoon his desire is not to feed the Godsey is to feed the ship has got an ear of the spirit amen Amina they come pray that right and they hear from God they are not having their ear to the mouth they put their ear to God so as we come to service this morning amen praise the Lord he says a lot more here in verse 31. amen I'm laying a foundation here oh praise the Lord praise God foreign after I spoke of The Parables is speaking to them all these things expect Jesus enter the multitudes in Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by azer the prophet saying will open my mouth [Music] from the foundation of the world are you together with me so when you come down to church be sure that God is going to say something but when he's coming to the very valuable foreign amen Amina just give me the linear I mean uh what what do you call that praise the Lord so that we can look at these seven churches to get these seven men here again amen so that we can go into something that we understand thoroughly well amen so that we can be able to understand just stand out there and make the seven churches amen and then you make sure that you are touching a shooter no you stretch out you are touching it because a church age you understand what I mean so we get seven shortages and I think we can see them laid out there it is and that's like demonstrate a second time the church has been one Church all the way from Ephesus it has been the same church which has moved and now has produced those that are us so now the first church age was the physics Christ was in the church failed in the people um he saw him walking through the seven golden Candles now these men here they represent the light of the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire that came upon the church that was the light that was the candle so the children of God the Bible says they became the next Church never church was born now they find another challenge and their commissioned to overcome and when they overcome amen amen they do you know become this church here and so now this church here which you are seeing here is the continuation of the same foreign foreign energy when it comes down here so all the revelation of the world [Music] Jesus stood right here yes amen Amina that's where the food for the bread is they rejected but then we are brought down here into the bridge this is where you find the brightest food the washing Waters it's given severeign [Music] foreign and we are here exactly why not waiting to be body changed into the Mirage so this is when the church has a stretched out but then you can have another view of the church the church is gave me that diagram also Foundation the church is at different states like the church had the step work you could today [Music] that's where we asked church amen Amina many times anyway we shall look at it as we go ahead when the Bible speaks about the word being said amen amen the concepts is about a scroll they didn't have books with the pages it was a scroll and so the inner scroll come to Amazon was the first sea I didn't scroll and now it was sealed you can use a suit up here and then you call it a seal and then you bring your second one and then another one and they are all seven you have to first of all break the outer seal which is the seventh sea why not soccer community that if you have got something precious day you keep it on the seat you don't just put it in the sitting room where every Thief can come and take or maybe when I was growing up as a young Pentecostal boy 1975 before many of you were born I was reading a book and now in this book The Man Who was talking about wisdom um [Music] he had the money in the house when the fifth came the money began to pray Heavenly Father keep my money which is in the shoes the thief just went for the show maybe again that's not how you keep something precious you know sometimes there's no life [Music] when people avoid the seals when they avoid the things which are hidden ideas in the time of the eyes [Music] because the eyes on the head and we are on the edge of the Earth are you together that's the time when God so that these things can give you eternal life are you together with me amen amen so Revelation chapter five very quickly the Bible speaks about a book amen Amina now he says here in verse 1. so in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and at the backside sealed with Seven Seas now he was Seated on the throne the book was in the right hand of authority and because he was in the throne there were four gods that were guarding the full living creatures nobody foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] hallelujah praise the Lord so let us look at these things because he was pretending to be Christ because Christ in Revelation 19. he comes right in the White House was trying to pose as Christ yeah foreign [Music] Hallelujah was the lion of the tribe of Judah the knowledge so in the Second Street the enemy was already a red host Rider movies because the people had rejected him he gets the sword yeah amen amen but the power man that sealed the names the anointing that labors in difficult conditions and also an animal of sacrifice than give up the world that anointing Came Upon the time 6 30 million I mean people died but they could not let go they were anointed to be sacrificed so that they can hold eternal life now the first suit the enemy was a black horse ride um but the power Iron Man that sealed the names to combat the Wilds of the enemies he tried to become the word but the people could not take it now he took a sword I'll kill them but the people say we would rather die now in the first he comes as a black horse rider he takes away the world he takes away the light of the word from the people that's why it's called the black horse and he created in what we call the Dark Ages in history because the people were not Guided by the word anymore and I want you to know that where we are intellectually bad spirits of the black horse amen Amina now what I want us to go and read about the third seal in the queen that we can show me because I'm still laying a foundation Revelation chapter 6 verse 5. and when he had opened the first seal your current team I have the fat to be said come and see and I beheld them low a black house now if you were here for the first time you are wondering where we are getting the living creatures you can get them in Revelation chapter four because they gathered in the throne the first one had the image of a life the second one had the uh Festival Knox I mean the likeness of the first of a man no works and then the fourth one had the likeness of a flying eagle so those were the living creatures according to the world you were also in the throne because you were in the book [Music] foreign now I'm going to say a few things when one denies people some sections of this message when somebody denies the people some sections of this message then he will be riding a black horse among the people Amen in that era the word was withdrawn and it was replaced by the sureness of developing theologies they started giving people novenas and the documents instead of the world now the church then was ran on liturgies who believes that he has got a revelation he writes a document and sends it over to the people with the scriptures we are going to read and how to apply them those of you who were out in those churches today's portion is in the Book of Mark it is from The Book of Mark those are liturgies and one so now when that one came and the church was evoked by Darkness a man having you know the spirit of God upon him his name was Martin Luther it is and that was now what opened up what we call in history the time of the Reformation foreign foreign when I went for a funeral of a relative of brother Ben or brother Ben are you here yeah it should be why I'm seeing him here again you know they were Catholics and after the funeral service to bring money so that the soul could be brought from purgatory to be taken to heaven foreign yes sir brother Ben I think that's right they collected the money they were trying to pray for this man so that he cannot uh uh perish in hell now for you people who really do not know where the Prosperity Gospel came from you are going to get your Millions if you bring this one that's where this comes from listen to what your Prophet says that third piece that Satan sent out yes he becomes shrewd a mess of which foreign or um interview foreign [Music] and there is this thing which was going around I don't know how many of you have heard of it he has this Minister saying hey that Spirit told me they are people who doesn't know me who doesn't know that you you can you can give him anywhere if he if your house has got here you cannot stop thank you I said come on God [Music] how can people do things like this but it comes from that era and then the prophet says making all the people give up their pensions their homes over certain things so the Prosperity Gospel is an anointing from that era family so therefore Pentecost pedagogy is not under the ego anointing [Music] are you together with me yeah Pentecost is under the Reformation that is under the ego and you always amen Amina so now from today we want to look at the bridge from a wide perspective we shall stand at different dimensions to view it gave me the linear edges here so that we can really be able to view the bridge of Kingdom in different dimensions the linear one is the one I want the church is in a line you got it yeah so now right here oh again you know Lord this you're here they looked out to Christ and the Christ came out praise we have value and he says behold they stand out in the door no yeah my voice and the Christ is the door that brings you to the bridge are you together with me at the End of the Age after Christ has been rejected he will have to stand again so that the people can you discover but their salvation that's why when Johnny was called out into the bridge coming foreign [Applause] [Music] to look at the bridge from a different perspective so in the bridge between the church edges here that is [Music] praise God Christ himself please win it seals that bridge [Applause] the reward foreign origin John chapter 10. I am the door to the Sheep now in Israel when a Shepherd brought back his ship oh before that they suffered um spoke in a certain way they could go about ten Shepherds into the posture but if the time is over for the belonging to this woman he just speaks in a certain way and they would start following him he slept in the door and the ship respected him so much Hallelujah my brother so that you may know that the shepherd into um the bridge chapter of Kingdom as we looked at it the other time May mean a whole she insulted the secretary foreign to be able to get access into the bridge amen Amina I am the door to the bridge and as long as the shepherd was in the door he became the security [Music] Hallelujah in the doors from anything that cannot go through that door there is no other thing that can go through the door brother Fox cannot go through that Jesus himself as the door yeah which we call come up either you remember Revelation chapter 4 verse one right now after those things after Jesus was locked down Jesus was locked out of the church yes in the denominational churches they don't reason in the terms of what Christ says because when he says I've refused the woman to preach if she preaches what happened in Christ being locked foreign after they rejected my brother you need to come through that door Hallelujah so the bridge color kingdom is that open door which also takes you in a space which is called the bridge foreign [Music] foreign [Music] now we are going to turn to the fifth chapter is talking about Revelation now this is not the seventh seals is the bridge between the church ages and the Sea you know what you know what that is the fourth chapter of Revelation in that it kind of revealed something what would take place after the church going up so he's telling you that the bridge and Revelation come out and I introduce you to the throne Revelation 5. come out value and see over [Applause] [Music] that blood that matters [Music] reveals the power of foreign amen Amina so we need to stand on a pedestal Twitter amen Amina and bring out the several views of the bridge now the prophet himself says for out of the edges back to the linear chat out of the edges comes the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets let's go back to the chat foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so now brother Branham tells us out of the ages [Music] comes the trumpets [Music] he's calling it foreign now now this age here we see that the uh the the the the the seal amen Amina was the lion of the tribe of Judah amen then this is [Music] you know this is Philadelphia Philadelphia we see totally here to never know that it's a black horse amen Amina and all these seals were breaking during the southern charges but why does he call the bridge a position between the church edges and the series [Music] we want to understand that amen Amina Pentecost is not particles of the ego anointing as we explain I'll give you this quote also now it says God is going to restore the river and Edge Restaurant it started the Reformation Edge did not restore remember the Pentecostal age has to restore yeah we cannot deny his word amen so the ego and the prophet cannoting of Elijah is where we find the restoration amen amen there was the foreign if the fire is the Holy Ghost then what about the wood Hallelujah and I told her sister the wood is the people upon which the Holy Ghost was to come Hallelujah and when Elijah came the Bible says he put in order the wood Hallelujah and we thank God that Elijah has been putting the wood together we can as well say Let the Fire Fall amen he's putting the wood together everybody in his position sisters in their positions they know how to teach their husbands they are being put together ready for the final fire amen they know how to dress not when they are coming to church only even when they are going to work they know how to dress not at work only but even when they are going to the party Elijah has put the younger people together bringing every body and position preparing us for the Chariot of Fire amen praise God do you love him this afternoon amen we just let the Fire Fall ing amen Amina yes sir Pentecost as a church they did not come under the ego anointed just came into the age to call out a bride because Lord this year rejected [Music] and bless you in the bridge [Music] amen Amina so you know uh matches they were under the first and second pool questions which is the opening of the world so how does the bridge stand between the churches see here's the answer now matches the seals we're acting out during the churchages [Music] [Music] they were in a symbol foreign are you together it's Malachi foreign are you together with him amen when the seventh century begins to sound his mystery um [Music] and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God reveals Revelations and then he says that the back side in the symbol foreign [Music] [Music] your kingdom gets its title this is but who knew who they were and now there's this bridge between the churches and the seeds now is not meaning the series were not broken but he's saying between the church foreign [Music] you know the Revelation now from the seals comes the fourth as manifestation and I'll show you so between telling us and the manifestation of water was hidden in the series it says there is a bridge here praise the Lord the different views for those who have been following the series when you read John in the Book of Revelation he's representing the bride when John was called into the bridge the door was opened and this door did not lead into geographical locations the bridge is not a geographical location like the land of Canaan against are you together with me when is it the bridge is God calling you to a higher spiritual order is the peak of the adoption season as sons of God in the end of age remember and this is where we are today amen Amina so in the bridge is where God gathers these adopted children as long as foreign foreign I don't want to be on the side of judgment I want to be part of that word I want to have that here amen amen listen to what he says he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches [Music] both through and Falls the message is then broadcast for all right who come within range of the message is received individually by unless certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group one was the ability what the spirit is it's broadcast wall but it is yours passionate holder it doesn't matter who says does it matter what the husband says [Music] come to receive their condemnation I do not want to be part of them I want to be one of those amen now listening and then turn to the fourth yeah have left your first life maintains his life when he goes he says I know the blasphemy of them which said they are Jews and they try to come among him I have a few things because now has their them that hold the doctrine of balance [Music] the church age [Music] foreign are you together with me so the church has been growing through efforts Philadelphia yeah [Music] for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself the blade after that the full corn in the ears but when the fruit is go through a progressive development that is protected [Music] you know the bride is then placed into the bridge until she's all what upon why come back she must bring back the very image of Christ before she takes change of Dimension she has to grow through the Life of Christ learning and knowledge to produce the image of Christ foreign you know like The church here and now he's not overcome it those who fail they become the shack now it comes here and those who overcome they become the shack so we've had seven Harvest Cycles praise the Lord and the shark has been falling off all the time because this servant have the psychos the honing of the church you give me the point are you together are you together with it you know there's been a falling away you know the the best beginning is so broad um the church goes foreign so that she may fit in the scripture we are not little brother force your father's place to give you the kingdom amen amen some must be honed and the prophet says that's the way the church is going to have to be so honed down the word honing the church comes to take the church until Christ comes Hallelujah one of these days you'll make it home the church is hoarding by the way as it's being preached and that word of the Lord Jesus Christ the church is in her final adoption by you because we don't have another church whoever comes now foreign praise knowing the enemy gradients want to grab it away from you wisdom I guess he grabbing it away from me taking you through trials to grab your Tower from you to grab it away from me like that Gentile Warrior [Music] the enemies of David [Music] even when there was no enemy left foreign amen Amina listen to this squad don't you remember the sleeping version when she raised up now remember what was she called um went out to meet the bridegroom is that right five words and many knows what all signifies in the Bible amen you are not Sanctified they was all Sanctified every one of them all Sanctified was wise enough have the wisdom of Revelation to catch that door either and when I looked there was a dog [Music] open in Heavenly places they had the wisdom of Revelations to be filled with the spirit to catch that door okay um the anointing a master that opens you into the bridge so let us dwell on the wisdom of Revelation here a little bit wisdom of Revelation now Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17. I promise you not to stay long so I should get away immediately Ephesians 1 17. that's the god of our Lord Jesus the father of Glory guitar foreign whom does he give it to achigani to the elected how can I know I'm elected if I stand with the world let anything else knock me down but I'll follow in this world he promises you are far above the devil you are far above all the fighting forces you are looking down at your weaknesses down here lift me higher than my weaknesses the father giveth it the spirit of wisdom and Revelation not only in the chapters of the book but in the power I am a man of his resurrection to know him not by The Works of history of the church but to know him that worketh in you open the door we mean praise God must be him at working us [Music] according to the power of money how does that power come to us because on a Sunday morning like this [Music] [Music] God damn foreign [Music] yeah you don't hear by your ears [Music] praise the Lord Jesus yes he was always seen by the eye of God amen amen I see my father I see my father I see my father this is now what he means that you have got the wisdom of Revelations the prophet says in the message then as Jesus confirmed yes that guiding eye is being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the Jews before ending of that church age for the Jews foreign [Music] [Music] because Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he looks through the eye of God as he can with his grace and has called us to be his sons and daughters to use us through the eye of God and see what will be and we will not walk in darkness as long as we look through God's eyes [Music] do you love him even weather the eye of God let me go for about 10 minutes or so amen I mean let's go to Matthew chapter 25. different views amen of the bridge the Bible says why the bridegroom terrorists they all slumbered and slept well and at midnight there was a crime behold the bridegroom comes out to meet him the Midnight Cry summons the bride into the bridge America [Music] either [Music] and when we come out we come into Union freedom because the person himself is there and then in that Union there must come alive who is the perfect man but I take the structure by way of Union this is what is happening in the bridge here as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the here of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding that's where we have already the invisible Union all the systems of the world and the religions how can we not be [Music] it's time that this foreign [Music] and all and all the things we could just take hours of showing how it all drifted back to Jesus Christ everything to him which is the fullness which is Among Us the fullness of redemption in him yet let's ever Redemptive name of Jehovah our salvation and Deliver Us what are you looking for the bridge over your peace the fullness of redempt [Music] just give me that diagram again is the linear diagram of the church together he comes at a time right here this is the door you come through Christ then come down through the seven churches god cartoon Christ Christian was revealing himself in portions that was dead that is that holds the Seven Stars just segment by segments but at the end of it he comes as a whole revelation of himself foreign hmm I tell you this is the message when that which is perfect is come and the prophet came down as the reviewed well yes God dealing with his bride by revelation as I've always said when we talk about the words of the entire person of the world which is the Holy Spirit the spirit of creation that was there in Genesis [Music] the gifts of foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] we are in what brother Branham calls the age of death which is perfect and that which is perfect comes down as the revelation of the world which is not Doctrine passes but word and spirits the world's richest speakers amen amen so we are in what brother bran I'm also called the brightest that's another perspective of the bridge amen I mean because we are in the time frame of the Lord this is it is a portion of this the Civil which he has cut off and because it's the bride yeah amen amen listen to what he says here in the raising of the Sun as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places in the bride coming in the bright coming of Christ in the bright coming of Christ meaning that the church has now manifested himself as the body of Christ that life is in them that's the bright coming of Christ and they will have to be a shift waived again in the last day waving of the sea or who will walk away the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a week that proved are you together with me so the fruit I mean when in your Testament they put wheat in the ground when it came to mature the first one was cut yesterday and it was waved to the people that look this is a testimony that which went into the ground has come to this is [Music] and in types and shadows that was to present Christ as the first one to come from the dead and pointing at you and me that we shall also come Okay so you know the fruit is proved by the nature of the parents look at this one here what does it means that anything else which is going to grow actually must be like this again foreign sing see what this is the Minister of William Brothers and if we also have to grow we have to come into the same image in this bright coming of Christ to define the seeds which was going to come before us are you together with me do you see why the minister of Malachi foreign Crystal he says hallelujah I am sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for a resurrection out of that denominationalism [Music] that's the full maturity of the world I stand back again in his full power Hallelujah and that's why you would stand there and he says you have got such and such a problem you have seen such and such a number of doctors do you believe me [Music] is beginning to be seen eternity ah it is proud to be with of anati distance our sisters are not ashamed of being the color that God made our sisters are not ashamed to cover their bodies but you keep doing the videos foreign [Music] that's the bridge Hallelujah
