[12:17] &gt;&gt; I want
[12:19] to be my way
[12:22] as I journey here
[12:25] below.
[12:28] For there is no other highway
[12:33] that a child of God should go.
[12:39] Though the road be steep and rough.
[12:45] If he leads me
[12:48] enough,
[12:49] [Music]
[12:51] I want God
[12:54] to be my way.
[12:57] Every day
[13:00] &gt;&gt; I want God's way.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; I want God's way to be my way.
[13:09] As I journey
[13:12] belong
[13:15] for the dream
[13:18] while the highway
[13:21] that a child
[13:24] should go
[13:27] the road is deep and rough.
[13:33] If he leads me, he's enough.
[13:37] [Music]
[13:38] I want God's way to be my way
[13:45] every day.
[13:47] [Music]

[16:31] [Music]
[16:38] in me.
[16:42] [Music]
[16:48] Amen.
[16:53] Amen.
[16:54] Amen.
[17:08] Let us pray.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this evening.
[17:16] Again,
[17:19] we commit the reading of the word into
[17:21] your hands.
[17:23] May you speak to us according to your
[17:24] vual and purpose
[17:27] and even according to our needs
[17:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus pray and
[17:32] ask.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Let us go to Hebrews chapter 3.
[17:39] We're reading from verse 7 to verse 14.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. The Bible says,
[17:49] &gt;&gt; "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost says
[17:51] today, if you will hear his voice,
[17:53] harden not your hearts as in the
[17:55] provocation in the day of temptation in
[17:58] the wilderness.
[18:20] When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
[18:22] and saw my works 40 years,
[18:36] Wherefore I was grieved with that
[18:38] generation and said, "They do always
[18:43] error in their heart, and they have not
[18:46] known my ways.
[19:00] So I swear in my wrath they shall not
[19:03] enter into my rest.
[19:10] Take heed, brethren, lest there be in
[19:13] any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[19:16] departing from the living God.
[19:31] But exalt one daily while it is called
[19:36] today, lest any of you be hardened
[19:39] through the deceitfulness of sin.
[20:01] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[20:05] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[20:07] steadfast unto the end.
[20:28] may God bless his word. You may be
[20:31] seated.
[20:33] So I want to pick our subject from verse
[20:35] 10
[20:38] which says and they have not known my
[20:40] ways.
[20:44] So I want to talk on the subject.
[20:47] This is my way.
[20:50] Praise the name of the Lord. So here he
[20:52] was talking about the children of
[20:54] Israel.
[20:57] How God led them from the land of Egypt.
[21:02] And you know by the time God was
[21:04] speaking them from the land of Egypt,
[21:08] he showed a lot of works.
[21:12] a lot of signs and wonders.
[21:16] And then he brought them to the
[21:18] sacrifice of the Passover.
[21:22] And then the death angel
[21:25] did not go into their homes
[21:27] because they had applied the blood of
[21:29] the lamb.
[21:31] But then to the n to the Egyptians,
[21:34] there was always death
[21:37] for the firstborn child and the
[21:39] firstborn animals.
[21:43] They were all dying that night. So then
[21:47] the children of Israel went
[21:50] and when they reached the Red Sea, they
[21:52] walked in a dry land
[21:55] and when they were even moving,
[21:57] you know, the Bible says the pillar of
[22:00] fire was there
[22:03] leading them during the night. Then
[22:06] during the daytime it was a cloud.
[22:10] And you know that cloud was covering
[22:12] them
[22:14] to shield them from the sun. Then at
[22:17] night there was a pillar of fire which
[22:20] would give them the light. And if there
[22:23] was coldness then it would also kind of
[22:26] emit heat
[22:30] you know to give them a comfortable
[22:31] condition.
[22:33] And now when they cross the Red Sea
[22:37] they were all rejoicing.
[22:40] And then the Bible says that Miriam and
[22:43] all the women
[22:45] were singing rejoicing
[22:49] a song of victory.
[22:51] Praise the name of our Lord. They had
[22:53] overcome Egypt.
[22:56] They had overcome unbelief in the world.
[22:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Now that is
[23:02] in numbers chapter 15.
[23:05] Praise the name of our Lord.
[23:08] Numbers chapter 15
[23:12] and then verse 20.
[23:17] Let us start from verse 18.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "The Lord shall reign forever
[23:23] and ever."
[23:26] Brother Exodus 15 verse 18.
[23:35] For the horse of Pharaoh went in with
[23:38] the chariots and with the horsemen into
[23:41] the sea. And the Lord brought again the
[23:44] waters of the sea upon them. But the
[23:47] children of Israel went on dry land in
[23:50] the midst of the sea.
[24:15] And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of
[24:17] Aaron, took a timber in her hand, and
[24:21] all the women went out after her with
[24:24] timbros and with dances.
[24:43] And Miriam answered them, "Sing ye to
[24:46] the Lord, for he has triumphed
[24:48] gloriously. The horse and his rider has
[24:51] he thrown into the sea.
[25:05] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[25:07] they were singing that song of victory
[25:11] like in the morning we sang happy day
[25:14] when Jesus delivered me from my sin. You
[25:17] know like the joy that you get
[25:20] that you have been saved.
[25:23] God has received you into his kingdom.
[25:27] So they were singing and rejoicing.
[25:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[25:32] you can imagine all the waters
[25:36] on the sides and then Pharaoh's army
[25:39] drowned in the waters.
[25:42] And then now as they went after that
[25:46] song of Jubilee,
[25:49] I'm saved. I'm set free.
[25:53] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[25:55] they were rejoicing over overcoming
[25:57] Egypt.
[26:00] And then they thought
[26:02] that the journey is now going to be that
[26:05] easy all the way.
[26:09] Ah everything is going to be okay.
[26:13] But they didn't know that the way of God
[26:18] he wanted them sanctified.
[26:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So when
[26:24] they come out of the Red Sea,
[26:28] the Bible says three days into the
[26:33] wilderness,
[26:34] they found no water.
[26:38] And then they they came and they could
[26:41] not drink of the waters of Mara
[26:45] because the waters were bitter.
[26:48] And then the people started murmuring.
[26:51] In Exodus 15 verse 24,
[26:56] and the people murmured against Moses,
[26:59] saying, "What shall we drink?
[27:17] And there was bitter water. And then God
[27:20] healed the water.
[27:22] And then now as they kept on going,
[27:27] there was no food.
[27:30] There's no shop to buy food. There is no
[27:32] garden to buy food.
[27:35] There is no world food program to throw
[27:37] down food.
[27:41] God was trying them,
[27:44] taking them through different
[27:46] situations.
[27:48] And then the Bible says in Exodus
[27:50] chapter 16,
[27:53] and then the scripture says in verse
[27:56] one, and they took their journey from
[27:59] Elm, and all the congregation of the
[28:02] children of Israel came out to the
[28:03] wilderness of sin, which is between Elim
[28:06] and Sinai. On the 15th day of the second
[28:09] month, after they departing out of the
[28:11] land of Egypt,
[28:30] And the whole congregation of the
[28:31] children of Israel murmured against
[28:33] Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[28:44] And the children of Israel said unto
[28:46] them, would to God we had died by the
[28:49] hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt,
[28:52] when we sat by the flesh pots, and when
[28:54] we did eat bread to fool. For you have
[28:57] brought us forth in the wilderness to
[29:00] kill this whole assembly with hunger.
[29:17] [Music]
[29:26] You know like they say they came out of
[29:29] Egypt
[29:31] but Egypt never came out of there. So
[29:34] they were referring to the flesh ports
[29:36] in Egypt.
[29:40] Oh, we had cemeteries to bur our dead.
[29:45] We had garlic. We had onions. We had
[29:49] this. We had towns. Now you brought us
[29:52] in the wilderness.
[29:54] And sometimes we can also be confused
[29:58] that when we come to Christ,
[30:01] everything should be as not in Christ.
[30:08] It shouldn't be like that. This is a
[30:10] different way.
[30:13] Praise the name of our Lord. And we need
[30:15] to learn the way of the Lord.
[30:19] The children of Israel
[30:22] had not known the way of the Lord.
[30:26] Anything they were lacking,
[30:28] they were complaining.
[30:31] everything they never had. They're just
[30:34] complaining,
[30:36] complaining.
[30:38] You know the way people cry to
[30:40] politicians
[30:43] even when their well water well is is is
[30:46] They want the politician to go
[30:47] and dig for them
[30:54] everything crying to politicians.
[30:59] So they were crying to God in every
[31:01] aspect.
[31:03] When the water was bitter or water is
[31:05] too bitter
[31:07] when they have no food, there's no food.
[31:09] Then God would drain the mana. Now you
[31:12] see that the children of Israel,
[31:15] every other time, they had something to
[31:18] complain about.
[31:20] When you go to chapter 17,
[31:23] they reached a certain place
[31:26] and there was no water.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And the people
[31:32] cried."
[31:35] Verse one,
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 17.
[31:39] And then verse one,
[31:42] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And all the
[31:43] congregation of the children of Israel
[31:46] journeyed from the wilderness of sin
[31:48] after their journeys according the
[31:50] commandment of the Lord and pitched in
[31:53] Rafidim, and there was no water for the
[31:56] people to drink.
[32:16] Wherefore the people did child with
[32:18] Moses and said, Give us water that we
[32:21] may drink. And Moses said unto them, why
[32:24] ch with me? Wherefore do you tempt the
[32:27] Lord?
[32:48] And the people thirsted there for water.
[32:50] And the people murmured against Moses
[32:53] and saying, "Wherefore is this that thou
[32:55] hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill
[32:58] us and our children and our cattle with
[33:01] thirst?
[33:21] you know, saying, "Why are you making us
[33:23] to suffer?"
[33:25] But they never knew the way of the Lord.
[33:29] So Moses cried to the Lord,
[33:32] said, "Lord,
[33:34] what shall I do with these people? They
[33:36] are almost ready to stone me.
[33:50] And then the people were saying, "Is the
[33:52] Lord amongst us?
[33:55] All these things we are going through
[33:59] but the pillow of fire was there, the
[34:01] cloud was there, the prophet is there.
[34:04] The other day mana is even coming down
[34:07] every day. And then they are saying is
[34:10] God amongst us
[34:13] in verse seven. And he called the name
[34:16] of the place Masa and Marba because of
[34:19] the chiding of the children of Israel
[34:21] and because they tempted the Lord
[34:23] saying, "Is the Lord among amongst us or
[34:26] not?
[34:42] Praise the name of Lord. They never knew
[34:45] the way of the Lord.
[34:48] Let us go also to numbers chapter 20.
[34:53] And we read also following the same
[34:54] things.
[34:59] And then verse two,
[35:01] &gt;&gt; and there was no water for the
[35:03] congregation, and they gathered
[35:05] themselves together against Moses and
[35:08] Aaron.
[35:19] And the people chedd with Moses, saying,
[35:22] "Would God that we have died
[35:25] when our brethren died before the Lord?
[35:40] And wherefore
[35:42] why have you brought up up the
[35:44] congregation of the Lord into the
[35:45] wilderness that we and our should die
[35:49] here?
[35:59] out of Egypt to bring us into this evil
[36:03] place is not place of seed, nor figs or
[36:07] vines or pomegranates. Neither is there
[36:10] any water to drink.
[36:20] for
[36:24] so
[36:33] they never knew the way of the Lord.
[36:38] Praise the name of our Lord. And
[36:39] sometimes you may also not know the way
[36:41] of the Lord.
[36:44] But the way of the Lord
[36:47] was to take them throughation.
[36:51] He takes you a situation where there is
[36:53] no food
[36:55] to learn to depend upon him. Praise the
[37:00] name of our Lord. He takes you through a
[37:02] station
[37:03] where there is no water
[37:06] for you to learn that God who created
[37:09] water can even create water in the
[37:12] earth.
[37:14] Like there is a time Samson had victory.
[37:18] He used a job born to kill thousands of
[37:20] Philistines.
[37:24] The spirit of God came upon him and
[37:26] killed thousands.
[37:28] But now after he had killed those
[37:30] people, he became so thirsty.
[37:35] Now Samson said, "Oh Lord, you have
[37:38] given me victory to be defeat these
[37:41] enemies,
[37:42] but you see thirst is killing me."
[37:46] And then the Lord heard Samson his voice
[37:49] and out of the hole in the jaw
[37:54] there was water which started coming
[37:56] out.
[37:57] Praise the name of our Lord. The same
[37:59] thing with Hagi.
[38:02] When Hagai was with Ishmael in the
[38:04] wilderness
[38:06] and then the sun was thirsting for water
[38:10] cry to the Lord and then the Lord made
[38:12] sure that the water starts flowing.
[38:15] So now the children of Israel
[38:18] never learned how to depend upon God
[38:23] in every stress that they were going
[38:25] through
[38:27] and God allowations to come in our way
[38:31] that we can learn to depend upon him.
[38:35] When there was no food, he proved that
[38:38] he can feed them a way.
[38:41] Now when they ate mana
[38:44] after many days and we are tired
[38:48] we've taken long without eating flesh.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Then Moses told God then God told Moses
[38:58] I'm going to rain it. I'm going to bring
[39:02] then Moses said are you going to blow
[39:05] the whole river to bring the fish here
[39:09] all these people are you going to feed
[39:10] them?
[39:11] Then God said you will see it. So every
[39:14] day
[39:16] there were birds flying
[39:19] and they were flying at a level of about
[39:20] three chits.
[39:23] You know where you would catch them
[39:26] every day. Everybody would pick whatever
[39:29] they would pick.
[39:33] God providing whatever they need.
[39:36] But they reach a station then they
[39:39] complain.
[39:41] when they are sick, brother Brandham
[39:44] teaches us they had Dr. Moses
[39:48] and Moses would only read one scripture.
[39:52] The Lord forgiveth all your sins
[39:57] and health all your diseases.
[40:00] He never had a hospital,
[40:03] but God was healing them. When the
[40:06] serpents came to to kill them,
[40:09] he told them, "Put the present serpent
[40:13] in whatever condition they were in." The
[40:16] Lord was always there
[40:19] to provide for their needs.
[40:21] And it's the same yesterday, today, and
[40:24] forever.
[40:26] So even as in whatever condition we go
[40:28] through, the Lord is always there
[40:32] to meet all that we have need.
[40:35] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[40:37] "I'm the very present helper
[40:40] in the time of trouble." But the
[40:42] children of Israel
[40:45] never learned how to trust in God, how
[40:49] to depend upon God, how to call upon the
[40:52] name of the Lord, but instead was
[40:54] complaining,
[40:56] mammar, why don't we go back to Egypt.
[40:59] When I was a castle, oh, I didn't suffer
[41:02] like this.
[41:04] When I was a protester, I didn't suffer
[41:07] like this. When I was in my village
[41:09] there, I could not sleep hungry.
[41:13] Now, that was in Egypt.
[41:16] Praise the name of our Lord. But here,
[41:18] it's a promised land.
[41:21] God is molding you.
[41:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Like the
[41:26] Bible says,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; you know, in Matthew chapter 13,
[41:31] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. Matthew
[41:33] chapter 13,
[41:36] &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse
[41:39] 20.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; But he that received the seed in stony
[41:45] in stony places, the same is he that
[41:48] heareth the word, and unknown with joy
[41:51] receiveth it.
[42:02] Yet that he has no root in himself,
[42:05] but endures for a while. For when
[42:08] tribulation or persecution arises
[42:12] because of the word, by and by, he is
[42:15] offended.
[42:31] Now he said that's the one who received
[42:34] the word by the rock.
[42:40] You know when the trials come
[42:44] said I think I'm in the wrong place.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; So he thought everything should be
[42:49] smooth.
[42:52] You know the way they sing that song
[42:58] but it's not
[43:03] &gt;&gt; smooth right
[43:08] I was sometime we got the the the
[43:11] spokesperson of the UPDF I think about
[43:13] five years ago six years ago
[43:20] They were saying that there are some
[43:21] soldiers who were killed in the game
[43:23] park or somewhere
[43:26] or maybe they were training.
[43:29] Then he said, "Amen.
[43:32] It's not a walk in the park.
[43:37] You know, see good flowers,
[43:40] good singing,
[43:42] fresh breeze.
[43:46] He said that military is not a walk in
[43:48] the park.
[43:52] There are things you go through hard
[43:57] and even our life as a Christian.
[44:00] There are ways God has prepared for us
[44:04] that this time you are going to climb
[44:07] the hill.
[44:09] And you know climbing a hill.
[44:13] You know how you feel the breath is not
[44:14] enough.
[44:17] You feel the legs are paining you.
[44:20] It's not just
[44:25] ah it's a nice ride.
[44:29] But people want that kind of way.
[44:33] That is not the way of the Lord.
[44:37] Praise the name of our Lord. now in the
[44:39] message but was not so from the
[44:41] beginning.
[44:43] Brother Brandham says
[44:46] it was spoken by it was spoken to
[44:48] brother Brham
[44:51] &gt;&gt; on February 11th
[44:56] 1961
[44:58] in the full gospel business men's
[45:00] breakfast
[45:04] because you have chosen the narrow path
[45:08] the harder way. Thou hast walked of thy
[45:13] own choosing.
[45:16] I can understand that
[45:19] Moses walked of his own, too.
[45:24] He didn't have to do it.
[45:27] I couldn't I could have maybe had big
[45:31] meetings,
[45:36] big things and great a lot of flowers
[45:39] and things too.
[45:43] This is the way I desired.
[45:48] Now you know it is so amazing
[45:51] with the gift that brother Brham had
[45:56] maybe many gifts.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; You know tens of thousands of people
[46:01] getting saved
[46:04] but he chose a humble way.
[46:08] Praise the name of our Lord. He chose a
[46:11] humble way.
[46:13] Like the church they had they had about
[46:16] 300 people.
[46:18] They only upgraded during the time of
[46:20] the se to 450.
[46:25] But for was not wanting it.
[46:28] But now with the ministry that he had,
[46:31] he was not looking to build a big
[46:33] stadium.
[46:36] Ah, you know, I'm a prophet of God. He
[46:39] have the biggest church around
[46:42] maybe a jet and everything.
[46:45] He chose a humble way.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And then he said,
[46:51] "Though hast walked of your own
[46:53] choosing,
[46:56] though has picked the correct and
[46:58] precise decision,
[47:01] and this is my way.
[47:05] Because of this momentous decision,
[47:08] a huge portion of heaven
[47:11] awaits you.
[47:13] That's the vision which you'll get
[47:18] that he know nothing about it then.
[47:22] What a glorious decision
[47:25] thou hast made. This is what will give
[47:29] you and make to come to pass tremendous
[47:34] victory
[47:36] in love divine.
[47:38] And God says this narrow path
[47:43] harder way is my way. Praise the name of
[47:48] he said this is my way.
[47:51] It's a precise decision you have done.
[47:56] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[47:58] children of Israel they never knew the
[48:01] way of the Lord.
[48:04] They thought the way of the Lord
[48:06] everything is going to be smooth
[48:08] throughout.
[48:11] They never knew. There are trials on the
[48:14] way.
[48:16] There are temptations on the way.
[48:19] You know there are things that are not
[48:20] pleasant on the way
[48:23] but yet it was the way of the Lord.
[48:27] You look what the heroes of faith
[48:33] You know, see how Moses was born
[48:36] and then he was protected in on the
[48:38] river,
[48:40] raised in Pharaoh's house.
[48:42] But for him to do the things of God, he
[48:45] had to deny the things of the world.
[48:49] He had to leave the comfort of Pharaoh's
[48:51] house.
[48:53] He had to be identified with the
[48:54] children of Israel
[48:57] who were suffering. Then the scripture
[48:59] saying he took on the riches of Christ,
[49:04] the suffering of Christ to be greater
[49:07] riches
[49:10] than the things of Egypt which perish
[49:13] for a short time.
[49:15] Let's go to Hebrews chapter 11.
[49:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:21] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 24.
[49:25] By faith, Moses, when he was come to
[49:28] Yaz, refused to be called the son of
[49:31] Pharaoh's daughter,
[49:39] choosing rather to suffer
[49:42] affliction with the people of God than
[49:45] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[49:48] season.
[50:05] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[50:08] riches than the treasures in Egypt. For
[50:11] he had respect the recompense of the
[50:14] reward.
[50:26] Praise the name of our Lord. He took the
[50:28] narrow path.
[50:31] They had a way and that is the Lord's
[50:34] way. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[50:37] you know even like Daniel
[50:40] he had a choice to worship the idol
[50:45] or to go into the lion's d.
[50:50] The three Hebrew children
[50:52] they had to choose worship the image not
[50:56] to go into the fire the way of the Lord.
[51:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in this
[51:03] in the message here
[51:05] healing and what sickness is
[51:08] he says and as long as we are getting
[51:11] acquainted.
[51:15] Okay let me start from here. Say God has
[51:19] two ways of all things
[51:23] that is the right way and the wrong way
[51:27] and your way and my way is the wrong
[51:30] way.
[51:32] God's way is always the right way.
[51:36] No matter how unright it seems to us,
[51:40] God's ways are true and right.
[51:45] They are past find they are past
[51:48] understanding.
[51:50] But God works in mysterious ways.
[51:54] His wonders perform.
[51:58] Now you can only come through faith.
[52:02] faith, not my faith,
[52:05] but in your faith, the individual faith.
[52:09] I might have faith in Jesus to be saved,
[52:14] but there has been many does not have
[52:16] faith to be saved.
[52:19] You cannot be saved until we have faith.
[52:24] I have faith in healing.
[52:27] Maybe you do not have faith in healing.
[52:31] So there is only one way
[52:34] for the Lord outside of the Lord.
[52:38] It's a wrong way. Praise the name of our
[52:41] Lord. So we always need to seek
[52:44] and find out which is God's way.
[52:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[52:52] message all the days of our lives
[52:56] he says
[52:59] man is prone to have his own way
[53:04] man wants to do things
[53:08] but he wants to do it his own way.
[53:11] He showed that just a few hours after
[53:14] his fall
[53:17] in the garden of Eden, he wanted to do
[53:20] his way
[53:22] because man is always satisfied as long
[53:25] as he's doing his own way.
[53:30] Now that's the weakness of man.
[53:33] My own way, my own experience. But we
[53:37] need to depend upon God
[53:40] that he can guide us in his way.
[53:44] Praise the name of God. So now when he
[53:46] was leading the children of Israel,
[53:50] he told them, be aware
[53:54] that I'm sending my angel before you.
[53:59] In Exodus 23:20,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; behold, I send my angel before you to
[54:07] keep you in the way and to bring you
[54:10] into the place which I have prepared.
[54:20] Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke
[54:24] him not, for he will not pardon your
[54:27] transgressions, for my name is in him.
[54:45] But if you indeed obey his voice and do
[54:48] all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy
[54:51] to your enemies and an adversary unto
[54:54] your adversaries.
[55:08] Praise the name of our Lord. So he sends
[55:11] his angel
[55:13] that the angel of God
[55:16] may go ahead of us may lead us. And
[55:20] right now the angel of the Lord he has
[55:23] sent
[55:25] is the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of
[55:27] our Lord. He says in John 16:3,
[55:34] "How when he, the Spirit of truth, is
[55:37] come, he will guide you into all truth.
[55:40] For he shall not speak of himself, but
[55:43] whatever he shall hear, that shall he
[55:45] speak, and will show you things to come.
[56:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So God has
[56:07] sent us the Holy Spirit
[56:09] and the reason why the Holy Spirit has
[56:11] come
[56:13] is to lead us in the way of the Lord.
[56:18] That's what the Bible says. as many as
[56:20] are led by the spirit of God.
[56:24] So the Holy Spirit
[56:26] leads us guides us in the way of the
[56:30] Lord. And the way of the Lord is known
[56:34] in the word of God.
[56:37] But the Holy Spirit will not take you
[56:40] out of the word, but the Holy Spirit
[56:44] will guide you into the word
[56:47] because he guides us into all truth.
[56:50] He makes known to us the way of the
[56:52] Lord.
[56:54] Praise the name of God. So we can have
[56:56] confidence that when we have the spirit
[56:59] of God dwelling in us living in us, he
[57:04] will guide us to the paths of truth and
[57:06] righteousness.
[57:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And so you
[57:10] need to see that you walk in the way of
[57:14] the Lord.
[57:16] Some other people may not have any
[57:18] difference.
[57:21] But then for you, if you have the spirit
[57:23] of God, the spirit of God will guide
[57:26] you.
[57:28] One day, brother Brandham had gone for
[57:30] mission missions in Europe.
[57:34] And then I think I'm just forgetting the
[57:36] country.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; But it's a country which is neighboring
[57:40] Russia.
[57:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[57:44] when they reached in that country,
[57:48] the people he was with, they were
[57:50] saying, "Ah, we are going out.
[57:53] We are going out to these or to these
[57:55] kind of places."
[57:58] And then now the Holy Spirit told him
[58:02] don't go there.
[58:04] Then he was wondering why. Then one of
[58:07] the brothers who was organizing the
[58:08] meetings came to him.
[58:11] And then he said, "Are you come
[58:15] here?" said ah. Then he would see men
[58:19] removing their clothes,
[58:22] put on towels
[58:24] and then go in a certain place. And then
[58:27] he saw some women also going where they
[58:29] were. Said, "No, you don't go there."
[58:32] He said no. They were just laughing at
[58:34] him. Then this brother was telling him,
[58:38] "You American, your American nurses or
[58:40] doctors,
[58:44] don't they examine the opposite sex?
[58:53] No, but that's not like this."
[58:56] But for them, they had comfort in doing
[58:58] that.
[58:59] You're not going to feel so good when
[59:02] you have that kind of thing.
[59:05] But the Holy Ghost said, "No, don't go
[59:08] there." Praise the name of our Lord. So
[59:11] the Holy Spirit knows what lays ahead of
[59:13] us.
[59:15] He knows the challenges.
[59:18] That's why you need to see that you
[59:19] depend on God every day.
[59:23] Lord, I'm starting out my day. I don't
[59:25] know what lays ahead of. Lord, I'm
[59:28] starting out the whole week.
[59:30] I don't know what lays ahead. Lord, I
[59:32] need a job. Guide me which kind of job I
[59:35] should get. Lord, I'm looking for a
[59:38] place where I'm going to live.
[59:40] I want you to guide me to a place where
[59:41] I'm going to live. So you don't take
[59:44] things for granted,
[59:47] you know, just saying anyhow, let me get
[59:49] this
[59:51] or let me be attracted by the physical
[59:53] things.
[59:56] Have you prayed over something you're
[59:57] doing?
[59:59] your friends, your people who are close
[1:00:02] to you. Do you commit to the Lord in
[1:00:05] prayer?
[1:00:07] Praise the name of our Lord because a
[1:00:09] wrong association
[1:00:11] can affect your Christian influence.
[1:00:16] Praise the name of our Lord or they can
[1:00:18] take you in the way of least resistance.
[1:00:26] Like in the message says is this the
[1:00:28] time
[1:00:30] there's a brother who had a dream and
[1:00:33] then he came and told brother Brana
[1:00:36] in the message says is this the time
[1:00:40] 136 paragraph
[1:00:42] he said I went to brother Biller
[1:00:46] and he he said down at his house one
[1:00:50] night
[1:00:52] when I was going on some calls
[1:00:56] He said, "Brother Brham, I had a strange
[1:01:00] dream." He said, "I dream that I was
[1:01:03] going down a stream of water
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:09] towards the west.
[1:01:12] And there was a road on the left side.
[1:01:18] And I was on the left side
[1:01:22] going westward
[1:01:26] on the road. Seeming like
[1:01:30] hunting for cattle.
[1:01:32] And on the right side,
[1:01:35] I happened to notice that after I got
[1:01:37] down there,
[1:01:40] there you were. And you were rounding up
[1:01:43] a big bunch of cattle
[1:01:47] and there was plenty of feed over there
[1:01:52] and said, "Then you got this cattle and
[1:01:57] started them back up the river
[1:02:01] and seemingly that I must have nodded to
[1:02:04] him to watch over those cattle.
[1:02:11] And he said now if it now it will be
[1:02:16] easy for those cattle
[1:02:18] I know they will go the way of least
[1:02:22] resistance
[1:02:27] but brother Brandham wants them to stay
[1:02:30] on the right side of the river.
[1:02:34] So I'll go back up this road
[1:02:37] and keep them from going across the
[1:02:39] river on this side.
[1:02:42] I'll keep them on that side.
[1:02:45] But he noticed I never followed the
[1:02:48] cattle
[1:02:50] but went on westward.
[1:02:53] He said he must be hunting.
[1:02:58] Now in paragraph 39 139
[1:03:01] he says now the interpretation
[1:03:05] of that dream is
[1:03:08] in so much that the stream was large.
[1:03:14] It was the stream of life.
[1:03:18] I was going westward on it
[1:03:22] and so was he
[1:03:25] because he was on a road.
[1:03:28] He was running small down this road
[1:03:33] and on the other side was lots of grass
[1:03:37] but lots of thicket
[1:03:41] you know bri thicket and jungle
[1:03:47] but in there
[1:03:50] was much grass
[1:03:52] and that's the way we hunt for the lord
[1:03:56] and the Food of the Lord
[1:04:01] through difficulty.
[1:04:05] Praise the name of our Lord through
[1:04:07] ticket.
[1:04:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Waiting on
[1:04:11] this waiting on this. Praise the name of
[1:04:15] our Lord. Sometimes you know you you
[1:04:17] start wondering
[1:04:19] what am I going to do? Like maybe when
[1:04:22] you're looking for something to minister
[1:04:24] that doesn't sometimes come that easy,
[1:04:28] you wait on this, wait on this. Then he
[1:04:31] said, but there is food there, but
[1:04:33] there's some difficulty
[1:04:36] to get it. And then he said, rounding up
[1:04:40] the cattle, rounding up the cattle
[1:04:44] was this church,
[1:04:48] keeping them on that side.
[1:04:51] K will actually go on the smooth road
[1:04:56] the denomination
[1:04:59] if they can which the road represent a
[1:05:02] denomination.
[1:05:05] I started him back up
[1:05:08] to see that they did not go to any
[1:05:11] denomination.
[1:05:14] So it is easy in this Christian life
[1:05:18] to go and do something wrong because
[1:05:20] it's easy to do it anyway.
[1:05:23] Very easy. But then the things of the
[1:05:26] Lord, praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:05:29] know it takes the grace of God to do the
[1:05:32] things of God. Praise the name of our
[1:05:35] Lord harder way,
[1:05:37] narrow way. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:05:40] But then you know whom you have
[1:05:42] believed.
[1:05:44] and you are persuaded
[1:05:46] that is more than able
[1:05:49] to take you through whatever challenge
[1:05:50] that you are.
[1:05:53] Praise the name of Lord. So we need to
[1:05:55] see that we avoid the way of least
[1:05:57] resistance
[1:06:01] and take the way of the Lord is
[1:06:03] despising.
[1:06:07] Abraham and Lord,
[1:06:09] you know, when they had a contest,
[1:06:13] Abraham told Lord,
[1:06:17] if you go west,
[1:06:19] I'll go east. If you go south, I'll go
[1:06:23] north. And he gave him the best option,
[1:06:30] the best deal.
[1:06:32] He told him when you go this side I will
[1:06:36] go the other side. And brother Brandham
[1:06:39] says
[1:06:40] that's the best way to do it for a
[1:06:42] Christian.
[1:06:44] You give the other person the best deal.
[1:06:50] He decides himself.
[1:06:54] So Lord chose where he wanted.
[1:06:57] Then Abraham chose another path. But
[1:06:59] Abraham depended upon the Lord.
[1:07:03] Lord chose the wellwatered valleys of
[1:07:05] Sodom and Gomorra,
[1:07:09] you know, where there was watering,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; you know, so animals would not suffer,
[1:07:14] there was plent of grass,
[1:07:17] but the Bible says, the men of Sodom
[1:07:22] were evil continually.
[1:07:26] Sometimes those are the things you may
[1:07:27] have before you. I'm getting a lot of
[1:07:30] money here.
[1:07:32] What is the condition of your soul?
[1:07:36] The Bible says righteous Lord, righteous
[1:07:40] Lord
[1:07:42] living in Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:07:45] it vexed his righteous soul.
[1:07:49] by the things he saw and by the things
[1:07:52] he heard.
[1:07:54] The animals were feeding well
[1:07:58] but his spiritual life.
[1:08:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:08:04] Genesis chapter 13,
[1:08:10] Genesis chapter 13
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and then in verse
[1:08:19] verse 8,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and Abraham said unto Lord, let there be
[1:08:24] no strife, I pray thee, between me and
[1:08:27] you, and between my heartsmen and your
[1:08:29] heartsmen, for we are brethren.
[1:08:47] is not the whole land before you
[1:08:50] separate yourself. I pray you for me if
[1:08:52] you will take the left hand I'll go the
[1:08:55] right side. If you go depart on the
[1:08:58] right side I'll take the left side.
[1:09:02] So go
[1:09:20] and Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[1:09:22] all the plain of Jordan. And it was well
[1:09:26] watered everywhere before the Lord
[1:09:29] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. given as
[1:09:31] the garden of the Lord, like the land of
[1:09:34] Egypt, as though comest unto Zora.
[1:10:02] and Lot chose all the plain of Jordan
[1:10:06] and Lot journeyed east and dispar
[1:10:08] themselves one from the other.
[1:10:26] And Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan,
[1:10:30] and Lot dwelt in the cities of the
[1:10:32] plain, and pitched his tent toward
[1:10:35] Sodom.
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:51] See the Lord was influenced by the
[1:10:53] physical appearance.
[1:10:56] You know the benefits physical
[1:10:59] but he was not looking at the spiritual.
[1:11:04] So the world the people of the world
[1:11:07] will always look at the carnal things.
[1:11:11] If we are in the way of the Lord,
[1:11:14] check the spiritual.
[1:11:17] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:11:19] spiritual aspect.
[1:11:22] Is the Lord pleased what I'm going to
[1:11:24] do.
[1:11:25] Is this the way of the Lord?
[1:11:28] It is the wide way. Because the Bible
[1:11:31] says the wide way
[1:11:34] there are many people that find it.
[1:11:37] And the wide way leads to destruction.
[1:11:41] And there are many people who find that
[1:11:44] wide way.
[1:11:46] But there are few people who find the
[1:11:49] narrow path. And that was the decision
[1:11:52] of Abraham.
[1:11:54] I want to be where the Lord is despised.
[1:11:56] If you are,
[1:11:59] I want to take the way of the Lord.
[1:12:02] That's what decision of brother Brana
[1:12:05] narrow path.
[1:12:07] They had a past not popular.
[1:12:11] Not everybody is going to part on you.
[1:12:14] You are our man. You are our man. And in
[1:12:17] many meetings,
[1:12:19] brother Brandham when he preaches, then
[1:12:21] they will come and tell him. Oh, you
[1:12:23] have a great gift. But you should stop
[1:12:26] talking about women.
[1:12:29] Don't talk about how they dress, how
[1:12:32] they paint themselves.
[1:12:34] You are ruining your ministry.
[1:12:38] wide way.
[1:12:40] Become a popular preacher. Let everybody
[1:12:43] say this is our man.
[1:12:45] Be a motivational speaker.
[1:12:49] And then said you should teach people
[1:12:50] how to speak in tongues,
[1:12:54] get those gifts,
[1:12:56] give those things, the way they dress,
[1:12:58] how they conduct themselves.
[1:13:01] Then you would ask them, "How can I
[1:13:04] teach algebra?
[1:13:06] when they don't know A B C D
[1:13:11] always believe Christ
[1:13:15] the way of least resistance
[1:13:20] let everybody come
[1:13:22] whether you dress in what or you conduct
[1:13:25] what
[1:13:28] we are all going to heaven no it's not
[1:13:30] like that
[1:13:32] bring the witch doctors also in church
[1:13:34] but also
[1:13:37] God's people bring the worshipers also
[1:13:44] these ones also Jesus's mother was born
[1:13:46] there way of less resistance
[1:13:52] we are all going to heaven it's not like
[1:13:54] that
[1:13:56] Abraham had to choose the way of the
[1:13:58] Lord Lot looked at the waters
[1:14:03] the vegetation
[1:14:04] And then he pitched his tent there.
[1:14:08] And the Bible says, "The men of Sodom
[1:14:12] were so wicked and evil before the Lord
[1:14:16] exceedingly."
[1:14:24] And then that's where your your
[1:14:26] influence is.
[1:14:28] I want to be near,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; you know, in business.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I need to get a shop
[1:14:36] and put it near that disco tech
[1:14:42] because there the business is there 24
[1:14:44] hours.
[1:14:47] So you're there in the night
[1:14:49] doing funny things there.
[1:14:52] I make a lot of sales at night.
[1:14:56] He pitched his tent towards Sodom.
[1:15:00] Every doubt that would come
[1:15:03] should be able to know receive but his
[1:15:07] soul was vexed.
[1:15:10] Praise the name of Lord. So you see Lord
[1:15:16] he avoided the hard way.
[1:15:20] Even when Abraham was interceding for
[1:15:23] it,
[1:15:24] the angels came and then the angel was
[1:15:27] telling him run to the mountain. It was
[1:15:31] a harder way. He said, "Let me go to the
[1:15:35] city."
[1:15:36] He was used to city life
[1:15:40] just want to be in a city. When he went
[1:15:42] to that city, he thought the men are
[1:15:45] evil.
[1:15:46] He took off.
[1:15:50] The way of less resistance,
[1:15:53] the way of the Lord. Praise the name of
[1:15:56] Lord. The Bible says it is a harder way,
[1:16:00] a narrow path, but the Lord gives you
[1:16:03] grace to go through that way. Praise the
[1:16:07] name of our Lord. He says, I will not
[1:16:09] leave you.
[1:16:11] I will be with you even in you. So, he
[1:16:15] gives you the strength. You can imagine
[1:16:18] when Lot left Abraham
[1:16:21] then the Lord came and told Abraham
[1:16:24] look all over
[1:16:26] even where a lot has gone all this land
[1:16:29] I will give to you
[1:16:32] praise the name of Allah and that's what
[1:16:34] the Lord was telling brother Brham
[1:16:37] the Lord was telling brother
[1:16:40] it's a narrow path it looks despised
[1:16:44] looks not pleased but I have A huge
[1:16:47] portion of heaven
[1:16:50] awaiting you. Praise the name of our
[1:16:52] Lord. Let us finish with Genesis chapter
[1:16:55] 18.
[1:16:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:17:00] verse 17.
[1:17:02] And the Lord said, shall I hide from
[1:17:04] Abraham that thing which I do?
[1:17:09] Abraham chose the place
[1:17:12] where he would fellowship with God.
[1:17:16] He chose a place where the angels of God
[1:17:18] would come.
[1:17:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[1:17:23] brother Brandham said that I'm a
[1:17:25] Nazerite.
[1:17:30] You know there is time he had to spend
[1:17:32] with the Lord.
[1:17:34] He wouldn't be like the others.
[1:17:37] So and so and so. He had to spend time
[1:17:42] with the Lord.
[1:17:44] So that would have that continuous
[1:17:46] fellowship.
[1:17:49] Praise the name of the Lord. So God
[1:17:51] said, will I from Abra what I'm going to
[1:17:54] do?
[1:17:55] Saying that Abraham shall surely become
[1:17:57] a great and mighty nation,
[1:18:05] and all the nations of the earth shall
[1:18:07] be blessed in him.
[1:18:12] For I know Abraham
[1:18:16] that he will command his children
[1:18:20] and his household after him,
[1:18:23] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[1:18:27] to do justice,
[1:18:30] judgment, that the Lord may bring upon
[1:18:33] Abraham
[1:18:36] that which he has spoken of him.
[1:18:39] Praise the name of our Lord. God spoke
[1:18:42] about Abraham
[1:18:43] and God was interested in teaching
[1:18:45] Abraham.
[1:18:47] Now when Abraham learns from the Lord,
[1:18:49] he would obey what the Lord is teaching.
[1:18:52] He would teach his children what the
[1:18:53] Lord is teaching. And then what the Lord
[1:18:56] has promised
[1:18:58] would come to pass. God involved
[1:19:01] Abraham,
[1:19:03] involved him in his promises.
[1:19:06] Praise the name of Allah. That is part
[1:19:08] of the promises.
[1:19:11] And now this is my way,
[1:19:14] the way of the Lord. God desires us to
[1:19:17] choose his way.
[1:19:20] That is the way of the Lord. He has
[1:19:22] given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy
[1:19:25] Spirit is here to lead every one of us
[1:19:29] to lead you at your home, to lead you at
[1:19:31] your place of work, to lead you at your
[1:19:33] school, lead you in the community.
[1:19:37] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[1:19:38] we have the Holy Spirit is to guide us
[1:19:41] every time. The decisions that you make,
[1:19:45] the words that you speak, the actions
[1:19:48] that you do, just allow the Holy Spirit
[1:19:52] to lead you in the way of the Lord.
[1:19:55] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:19:56] you'll have peace
[1:19:58] that surpasses all understanding.
[1:20:02] The joy of your salvation,
[1:20:04] you'll always be happy.
[1:20:07] When you find that you have done the
[1:20:08] things of the Lord,
[1:20:10] when they when they the disciples,
[1:20:14] when they were beaten,
[1:20:16] the Bible says, they came back rejoicing
[1:20:21] because God has counted them worthy
[1:20:25] for his name,
[1:20:27] led of the spirit of praise the name of
[1:20:30] our Lord. This is my way. And if it is
[1:20:33] the way of the Lord, we need to desire
[1:20:35] to walk in the word of God.
[1:20:38] Sometimes it's not pleasing to the eyes,
[1:20:42] but yet there is joy in it.
[1:20:45] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:20:47] Bible says, "There is great joy.
[1:20:51] Praise the name of our Lord." Psalms 19
[1:20:55] in keeping of them.
[1:20:58] There is great joy.
[1:21:01] Psalms 19
[1:21:04] and then verse
[1:21:12] verse
[1:21:14] 10.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; More to be desired are they than fine
[1:21:18] gold than much fine
[1:21:20] sweeter than honey and honeycomb.
[1:21:25] Verse 10. Psalms 19:10.
[1:21:43] Moreover, by them is your servant
[1:21:45] warned, and in the keeping of them there
[1:21:48] is a great reward.
[1:22:03] Praise the name of our Lord. There is
[1:22:05] great reward.
[1:22:07] Just take the way of the Lord.
[1:22:10] Praise the name of our Lord. There is
[1:22:12] protection in it. There is comfort in
[1:22:15] it. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:22:18] know when they they left the Lord Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ.
[1:22:22] They deserted him. He told them, "I'm
[1:22:26] not alone." Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:29] I'm with the Lord. Praise the name of
[1:22:32] And the Lord always comes down
[1:22:35] to help you in the challenges you are
[1:22:36] in.
[1:22:38] When Daniel was in the lion's day,
[1:22:41] God sent his angel and stopped the mouth
[1:22:44] of the lion.
[1:22:47] When the three children were in the
[1:22:48] fire,
[1:22:50] God himself came down.
[1:22:52] Praise the name of the Lord. So we know
[1:22:54] in the narrow path,
[1:22:57] the harder path, the Lord will always be
[1:23:00] present with you.
[1:23:02] Praise the name of our Lord that you can
[1:23:04] be encouraged
[1:23:06] that you can feel strengthened.
[1:23:08] When Jacob was running away from Esau
[1:23:12] and he was tired and then he put a stone
[1:23:15] for a pillow,
[1:23:18] the Lord came in that night and showed
[1:23:20] his presence to
[1:23:23] said, "I'm going to be with you. Even
[1:23:26] where you're going, I will bring you
[1:23:28] back." Praise the name of Lord. What a
[1:23:31] consolation we have
[1:23:33] that regardless of the trials that we go
[1:23:35] through,
[1:23:37] regardless of the challenges we go
[1:23:38] through, the Lord is always present with
[1:23:42] us.
[1:23:43] Praise the name of our Lord. So if you
[1:23:45] in the wilderness,
[1:23:47] when there is no water is the one who
[1:23:50] creates the water. Praise the name of
[1:23:52] our Lord. So if you're in a
[1:23:55] you have no food at home, he's the one
[1:23:57] who brings food.
[1:23:59] If you're in a situation, you are so
[1:24:02] weak. You see you can't move forward.
[1:24:05] He's always present. Praise the name of
[1:24:08] Allah. Like when God told Abraham,
[1:24:11] I am God with breast,
[1:24:14] the blessed one, telling an old man.
[1:24:19] He was telling an old man, "Come and
[1:24:22] from my breast.
[1:24:25] Receive the promises of God. to have
[1:24:27] strength to continue moving forward.
[1:24:30] When Abraham was afraid, I'm going to
[1:24:33] die and I have no hair,
[1:24:36] he said, this is what's going to be your
[1:24:38] generation.
[1:24:40] Praise the name of the Lord. We just
[1:24:42] need to wait on the Lord
[1:24:45] and then the Lord will take us through
[1:24:46] the pathway
[1:24:49] into his way. Praise the name of our
[1:24:52] Lord. Sing that song,
[1:24:55] they that wait upon the Lord.
[1:24:58] May God bless you.
[1:25:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:03] Song number 10. As the song leader comes
[1:25:08] to lead us in worship, then we start the
[1:25:10] Lord's supper.
[1:25:15] They that wait
[1:25:18] upon the Lord
[1:25:21] shall renew
[1:25:24] their strength.
[1:25:27] They shall mount
[1:25:31] with wings
[1:25:33] as an eagle.
[1:25:38] They shall run
[1:25:41] and not be weary.
[1:25:44] They shall walk
[1:25:47] and not
[1:25:50] teach me Lord.
[1:25:53] Teach me Lord
[1:25:57] through way.
[1:26:01] Teach me Lord
[1:26:04] true way.
[1:26:08] I
[1:26:11] might
[1:26:14] kill in your
[1:26:17] all good time.
[1:26:20] You will
[1:26:23] like me.
[1:26:26] Oh, teach me not
[1:26:30] to
[1:26:40] wait
[1:26:42] in
[1:26:45] for
[1:26:48] a fall.
[1:26:51] For they are waiting
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:59] you
[1:27:03] will Heat. Heat.
[1:27:20] and I be
[1:27:27] f
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:36] to way.
[1:27:41] Oh, teach me what
[1:27:45] to
[1:27:55] help me. I
[1:28:01] will I
[1:28:05] your name.
[1:28:07] Oh my.
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:21] Let me be
[1:28:24] on
[1:28:27] what you want
[1:28:30] me to do to thee.
[1:28:33] For they
[1:28:36] all Oh
[1:28:39] sh.
[1:28:58] Oh, they shall run
[1:29:01] and all be well.
[1:29:05] They shall walk
[1:29:07] and no faith
[1:29:11] or teach me love.
[1:29:14] Teach me love
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:17] to win.
[1:29:24] He
[1:29:27] chose
[1:29:29] me.
[1:29:35] Will he
[1:29:38] chose
[1:29:42] me?
[1:29:48] I love
[1:29:54] you for
[1:29:57] me
[1:30:00] and you be
[1:30:03] a fish
[1:30:05] of me.
[1:30:11] Heat.
[1:30:16] Heat.
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:37] And we know
[1:30:40] back all
[1:30:43] the things left
