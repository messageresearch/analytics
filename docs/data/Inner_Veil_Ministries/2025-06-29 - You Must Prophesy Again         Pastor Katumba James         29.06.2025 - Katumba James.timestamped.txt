[25:47] the needs of all your children. Lord,
[25:50] our prayer minister upon these meetings,
[25:52] Father, we also remember our pastors and
[25:54] ministers today
[25:57] that Lord, you may anoint him and use
[25:59] him, Father.
[26:01] We also remember the different prayer
[26:02] requests
[26:04] of many brothers and sisters who are not
[26:07] to come here today
[26:09] that Lord you may be with them where
[26:10] they have gone to
[26:13] even those who are sick and afflicted.
[26:16] We pray that you may touch them in such
[26:17] a special way and heal them in the name
[26:20] of Jesus Christ. Grant bless us all
[26:23] together
[26:25] revealing and manifesting yourself to us
[26:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus prayer and
[26:30] ask this.
[26:32] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[26:38] I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[26:39] Christ.
[26:42] We thank God for the cool morning.
[26:46] Praise the name of our Lord. I bring
[26:49] greetings from pastor.
[26:52] He's still in Moza.
[26:55] So they are finishing the conversion
[26:56] today with brother Andreas.
[26:59] And just keep him in your prayers.
[27:02] Praise the name of our Lord. I see
[27:05] visitors among brother Ambrose. You are
[27:06] welcome with other brothers. If you can
[27:08] stand up for recognition.

[27:18] Our sisters, you may sit down. Thank you
[27:21] for coming to be with us.
[27:24] Praise the name of our Lord.
[27:27] So, we appreciate God for the grace he
[27:29] has given unto us
[27:31] and being back this morning.
[27:34] Praise the name of our Lord. I'd
[27:37] announce that we are going to have two
[27:38] services today.
[27:42] The second service being for the married
[27:44] people, those who are going to marry.
[27:49] But we shall not have the afternoon
[27:51] service.
[27:54] Praise the name of our Lord. And I pray
[27:57] that the Lord gives us grace to have it
[27:58] another time.
[28:02] I tried to wait on the Lord in the
[28:04] course of the week
[28:07] to get a message
[28:09] but I didn't get for the one for the
[28:11] afternoon
[28:13] but yet I had many sermons coming
[28:15] through.
[28:18] [Music]
[28:20] Praise the name of our Lord. I believe
[28:22] we shall call the married people's
[28:23] meeting in the due course when the Lord
[28:26] gives something on our hearts.
[28:32] On next Sunday we're going to have two
[28:34] services.
[28:37] It's the first Sunday of the month.
[28:41] I think just put on this.
[28:44] It's next. It's the first Sunday of the
[28:46] month.
[28:49] We are going also to have the Lord's
[28:51] supper next Sunday.
[28:54] So come prepared to spend the whole day
[28:56] at church.
[28:59] Praise the name of our Lord. We also
[29:01] want to appreciate those who turned up
[29:03] for the overnight on Friday
[29:07] and just keep on encouraging you
[29:10] that whenever there are services around
[29:12] always make sure that you are part of
[29:13] them.
[29:17] Praise the name of the Lord. Today we
[29:19] are going to have a long service.
[29:24] I hope now I'm not discouraging you,
[29:27] but I'm encouraging you
[29:31] that be prepared.
[29:33] Praise the name of our Lord. At least
[29:35] more than two hours.
[29:38] You know, God has given us a very
[29:40] beautiful message.
[29:43] Praise the name of our Lord.
[29:45] And I think this is the third service
[29:48] I'm preaching about going to testify to
[29:51] others.
[29:56] And I feel today we need to talk about
[29:59] you must prophesy again.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:06] So we are going to look more on the
[30:08] lifeline of brother Brham.
[30:12] the different things God was doing in
[30:14] his lifetime.
[30:17] And then we have printed out.
[30:23] You can get this information on our
[30:25] church website.
[30:29] When you go to our church website, in
[30:31] Ministries
[30:34] Ministries,
[30:39] you'll find all this information.
[30:42] So we just printed out we just got them
[30:44] out and printed them out
[30:48] and then
[30:50] those we shall be giving out these
[30:52] copies to each and every person who can
[30:54] read.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:58] They about seven to eight pages.
[31:06] We are sorry that we forgot to add more
[31:08] copies for Uganda.
[31:13] But we shall take note of those who can
[31:15] only read Luganda.
[31:18] We shall get them copies in the course
[31:20] of the week or next week.
[31:23] But then for those who can read English,
[31:26] each of you will have to get a copy
[31:29] especially if you are in from 13 years
[31:32] or 14 years and you are serious.
[31:47] Each of us should get it.
[31:50] And I would pray that you take time and
[31:52] read it
[31:55] and and let these things be part of you.
[31:58] So that when you are talking with
[31:59] somebody that God has sent us a message,
[32:04] you can even refer to what God has done
[32:08] and bring them in the current affairs,
[32:12] the things which the world knows, the
[32:15] things that have happened and tell them
[32:17] more about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:21] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[32:23] the next service that I will come
[32:26] which may be a Sunday maybe next week
[32:28] after next week
[32:31] I want to take also another sermon on
[32:34] going out to tell people about Christ
[32:40] and then we shall talk about you know
[32:41] godhead water baptism and all those kind
[32:44] of different things
[32:48] and then we shall also give out some
[32:49] more trackcts which we have printed out.
[32:53] which you can use having scriptures
[32:57] to see that you can testify to your
[32:59] friends
[33:01] to your neighbors
[33:03] say that the message doesn't stop to at
[33:05] you.
[33:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now before
[33:09] we got the reading of the scriptures,
[33:12] let me invite the youth to come and sing
[33:14] us that song about the message of the
[33:18] hour.

[40:04] living at this end time.
[40:08] Praise the name of our Lord. We happy
[40:10] that the Lord send us a prophet
[40:14] and that's what makes a difference
[40:17] with others born again or saved groups
[40:22] because we believe the Lord has sent us
[40:24] a prophet
[40:26] and the prophet he sent us.
[40:29] He gave him the message.
[40:32] Praise the name of our Lord. And it is
[40:34] that message
[40:36] that prepares us for the second coming
[40:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:43] Outside of the message of the hour,
[40:46] you can never be ready for the rapture.
[40:49] Praise the name of our Lord. And it's
[40:51] the message of the hour
[40:53] where the blood of Jesus Christ is
[40:58] because it is the word of God. And if
[41:01] you don't believe in the word of God,
[41:04] then your sin remain
[41:07] and your sins are not remitted.
[41:10] And so the message we have is where the
[41:14] blood is,
[41:16] is where the sacrifice is,
[41:19] is where eternal life is.
[41:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So let us
[41:25] stand up and have a word of prayer and
[41:26] take the scripture reading.
[41:29] [Applause]
[41:31] Father, how we are thankful unto you
[41:33] this morning
[41:35] that when we come to church here today,
[41:39] we don't come to handle a closed book,
[41:45] but it's already an open book. The seven
[41:48] seals have already been revealed.
[41:52] And the book releases us,
[41:56] makes us to identify ourselves,
[41:59] makes us to know that our names are
[42:01] written in
[42:04] and makes us to have that assurance
[42:08] that we are the children of God. We pray
[42:11] that father may speak to us again
[42:15] as father we go back to the things that
[42:17] have been already prophesied
[42:20] that you may also give us grace father
[42:23] that we can also prophesy these same
[42:25] things that we may be able to bring many
[42:28] souls into your fold
[42:31] those who have been ordained to eternal
[42:33] life. May the message be a real living
[42:37] episo in our lives.
[42:41] that may influence our thinking,
[42:44] may influence our speech,
[42:46] may influence even our lives that
[42:49] anything outside of the message
[42:52] may be completely rejected by us. We
[42:55] love you Lord. We thank you father and
[42:58] give praise to your holy name. In the
[43:01] name of the Lord Jesus, we do pray and
[43:03] ask this.
[43:05] Amen. We go to Revelations chapter 10.
[43:09] We're reading from verse 7 to verse 11.
[43:15] And our subject,
[43:17] you must prophesy again.
[43:22] So the Bible says, but in the days of
[43:25] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[43:28] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[43:31] should be finished as he has declared to
[43:33] his servants the prophets.
[43:48] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[43:51] spoke unto me again, and saying, Go, and
[43:53] take the little book, which is open in
[43:56] the hand of the angel, which standeth
[43:58] upon the sea, and upon the earth,
[44:19] And I went unto the angel, and said unto
[44:22] him, Give me the little book. And he
[44:25] said unto me, "Take it and eat it up,
[44:27] and it shall make thy berry bitter, but
[44:30] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[44:35] [Music]
[44:55] And I took the little book out of the
[44:57] angel's hand and ate it up. And it was
[45:00] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[45:03] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[45:23] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[45:27] again before many peoples and nations
[45:30] and tongues and kings.
[45:48] May God bless his word. So we must
[45:51] prophesy again. You may be seated.
[45:54] Praise the name of our Lord. We must
[45:57] prophesy
[46:00] as you have received the message of the
[46:02] hour.
[46:04] God requires each and every one of us
[46:08] to take this message and speak it to the
[46:11] other people.
[46:13] And so you will be speaking the same
[46:15] thing,
[46:17] you will be prophesying.
[46:19] And you see the way God works out like
[46:23] when you read in the book of Daniel,
[46:26] the angel would come and reveal to
[46:28] Daniel the things.
[46:31] Now when Daniel gets these things,
[46:34] He writes them down and then he tells
[46:37] others.
[46:39] So he was prophesying
[46:42] and so even you see John on the aisle of
[46:44] Patimos
[46:47] you know the God sent his angel and then
[46:50] the angel would come and reveal to John
[46:54] these things and then he was told write
[46:56] them and put them in a book
[46:59] and send it now.
[47:02] And then now when he would get it and
[47:05] then he writes it and then the Bible
[47:08] says unto the angel of the church of
[47:10] Ephesus
[47:13] and then it went on like that. So now
[47:16] when the angel of the church of Ephesus
[47:21] when he would come to see John
[47:24] then John would give him the prophecy.
[47:27] Then the angel would go and prophesy
[47:30] by reading it to the people who are
[47:32] concerned and then also as we pick the
[47:35] same things and then we also prophesy to
[47:39] others. In other words, we tell others,
[47:43] praise the name of our Lord. Like you
[47:45] know that song that says go and tell it
[47:48] unto the world,
[47:50] praise the name of our Lord that the
[47:52] Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord God
[47:55] Almighty.
[47:57] So what you have believed,
[48:00] what you have received, you also go and
[48:03] tell others.
[48:06] And know Paul was talking about
[48:09] that we heard.
[48:11] And what we heard, we believed it.
[48:16] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[48:18] said, when we believed it, we also speak
[48:21] the same thing. We testify the same
[48:24] things. So you believe
[48:28] and when you believe it, you receive it.
[48:31] Then you also go and testify to others.
[48:35] Tell return to the world. Praise the
[48:38] name of our Lord. Let the others know
[48:40] that God has sent us a prophet.
[48:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Like now we
[48:45] are in the scripture we have read.
[48:48] The Bible says, "But in the days of the
[48:51] voice of the seventh angel,
[48:56] when he shall begin to sound.
[49:00] In other words, when he starts to
[49:02] preach,
[49:04] he says, "All the mystery of God
[49:09] should be finished,
[49:11] should be revealed."
[49:14] Now, we see that Daniel
[49:17] was able to see the mysteries
[49:21] when we go to Daniel chapter 12.
[49:24] And then verse 8 and verse 9
[49:33] and I heard but I understood not. Then
[49:37] said I, oh my lord, what shall be the
[49:40] end of these things? And he said, go thy
[49:42] way, Daniel, for the words are closed up
[49:46] and sealed till the time of the end.
[49:52] [Music]
[49:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Daniel got
[50:01] the mysteries,
[50:04] but then he was told, "Seal up the book
[50:08] until the time of the end."
[50:12] And now when you look at the book of
[50:14] Daniel,
[50:16] he was talking about the redemption of
[50:18] Israel.
[50:19] And then he was talking about the great
[50:21] judgment.
[50:23] And you see all these kind of things
[50:25] coming out.
[50:27] And then John also in the book of
[50:30] revelation when he was seeing all these
[50:33] things he was writing them down.
[50:37] But then it reached a place here.
[50:40] Praise the name of our Lord. In
[50:42] Revelations chapter 10.
[50:45] And you know when the seven thunders
[50:47] uttered their voice
[50:51] in verse three and he said that he cried
[50:54] with a loud voice
[50:57] as the lion roeth
[51:00] and when he had cried
[51:02] the seven thunders uttered their voices.
[51:08] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[51:10] their voices,
[51:13] I was about right.
[51:17] And I heard a voice from heaven saying
[51:19] unto me,
[51:22] "Seal up those things
[51:25] which the seven thunders uttered,
[51:29] and write them not."
[51:32] But yet John was instructed
[51:36] in Revelations chapter one
[51:39] to write whatever he heard.
[51:44] But then here when the thunders utter
[51:46] their voices,
[51:49] he's told don't write them.
[51:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[51:54] message
[51:56] questions and answers on the seals
[52:00] question 395
[52:05] they were asking brother Brham
[52:08] have the seven thunders which equals
[52:10] seven mysteries already been revealed
[52:18] were they revealed in the seven seals
[52:23] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[52:26] as standards yet?
[52:28] [Music]
[52:31] I wish we get that.
[52:34] Praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[52:37] "Have the seven thunders which equals
[52:39] seven mysteries already been revealed?"
[52:46] I want us to follow that closely
[52:48] together.
[52:51] We want to prophesy again.
[52:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Say that
[52:56] somebody tells you
[52:58] ah you know the seven thunders have not
[53:00] been revealed.
[53:02] You can tell them where you get.
[53:06] Praise the name of our Lord. We must
[53:08] prophesy again.
[53:11] And you know it's the mysteries
[53:16] of the book
[53:18] that turn the hearts of the children
[53:26] to the apostolic fathers.
[53:30] Everybody can say I'm saved. I'm saved.
[53:32] I'm saved.
[53:33] All the denominations are preaching
[53:35] about salvation.
[53:38] Let us put that thing there.
[53:40] Praise the name of our Lord.
[53:43] Everybody is preaching about salvation.
[53:47] But how many are getting the people the
[53:50] true message
[53:54] to turn their hearts
[53:57] to the apostolic fathers
[54:00] to the original gospel of the Bible.
[54:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So, brother
[54:06] Brandham was asked this question.
[54:09] Have the seven thunders
[54:12] which equals the seven mysteries
[54:15] already been revealed
[54:19] where they revealed in the seven seals
[54:23] but are yet but are yet or not known to
[54:26] us as thunders?
[54:31] Then he says no they were revealed in
[54:36] the seven seals.
[54:42] That's what the thunders was about.
[54:48] They was to reveal
[54:50] the seven thunders
[54:53] that had uttered their voices
[54:57] and no one could make out what it was.
[55:03] John knew what it was,
[55:07] but he was forbidden to write it.
[55:10] He said, "But in the seventh angel,
[55:15] in the days of his sounding,
[55:19] the mysteries of
[55:23] should be revealed.
[55:26] The seven mysteries
[55:29] of the seven thunders
[55:32] should be revealed.
[55:35] And the seventh angel
[55:38] is the messenger
[55:40] of the seventh church age.
[55:46] Now the question comes, have we got the
[55:49] messenger of the seventh church age?
[55:55] Did we get the messenger?
[55:57] Yes, we got the messenger.
[56:00] If we got the messenger
[56:02] of the seventh church
[56:05] which is William Marion,
[56:08] then all the mysteries
[56:12] even the seven mysteries
[56:15] have been revealed.
[56:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[56:20] don't wait for the eighth messenger.
[56:24] to come and reveal to you
[56:27] I wish you control the issues of volume
[56:29] there. So you don't need
[56:33] you know another person
[56:36] ah you know this book
[56:40] you know you need the five-fold ministry
[56:42] here
[56:44] messenger here
[56:47] all the mysteries
[56:49] that are in the book
[56:53] in the messenger of the hour praise the
[56:56] name of so you must prophesy again.
[57:02] Praise the name of God. Now in the
[57:05] message
[57:10] I want us to go to I sent some slides
[57:13] there.
[57:17] I just want to go to the message the
[57:19] bridge between the seven church ages and
[57:21] the seven.
[57:28] He says And remember, it comes at the
[57:32] seventh church age
[57:36] when the mysteries of God will be opened
[57:38] up.
[57:42] Praise the name of the Lord. That's the
[57:44] time
[57:46] at the end time
[57:49] when all the mysteries are revealed.
[57:54] So God has sent us a messenger,
[57:57] a prophet of the hour
[58:00] who has revealed the mysteries of God.
[58:05] Praise the name of God. He has sent a
[58:07] messenger,
[58:09] who has revealed the message of the hour
[58:13] and given the mysteries.
[58:16] Praise the name of the hour. And then in
[58:20] the message the bridge between the seven
[58:21] church ages and the seven seals
[58:27] brother says
[58:30] he says
[58:33] and the book
[58:36] open
[58:37] open the book and to off the seals
[58:42] that is the lamb of God. and he sent it
[58:45] down to the earth
[58:48] to his seventh angel
[58:52] to reveal it to his people.
[58:56] Praise the name of. So Christ, he opened
[59:00] the book of
[59:02] now when he opened the seals,
[59:05] then he sent the book
[59:09] to the seventh angel.
[59:11] And then the seventh angel
[59:14] comes down and then he reveals this
[59:17] book.
[59:20] So now in the message of the hour
[59:23] it reveals the mysteries.
[59:26] Praise the name of that hidden
[59:31] through all the ages.
[59:34] Praise the name of So we have the
[59:37] message of the hour
[59:39] and it's the message of the hour
[59:42] that turns the hearts of the children
[59:47] to the fathers.
[59:49] Praise the name of God. Let us go to the
[59:52] first
[59:54] he says
[59:56] but revelation 10 revelation 10
[1:00:01] said his message
[1:00:04] was to reveal
[1:00:07] not reform.
[1:00:11] Reveal the secrets.
[1:00:14] Reveal the secrets.
[1:00:16] It's the word in the man.
[1:00:22] Hebrews 4 said
[1:00:25] that the word of God
[1:00:28] is sharper than a two-edged sword,
[1:00:32] piercing even the sand of bone
[1:00:38] and a revealer of the secrets of the
[1:00:40] heart.
[1:00:43] See this man
[1:00:46] is not a reformer.
[1:00:49] He is a revealer.
[1:00:52] Reveal of what? The mysteries of God
[1:00:57] where the church has got it all tied up
[1:01:03] and everything. He is to come forth with
[1:01:06] the word of God
[1:01:09] and reveal the thing out
[1:01:13] because he is to restore the faith of
[1:01:15] the children.
[1:01:19] to the fathers.
[1:01:21] The original Bible faith
[1:01:25] is to be restored
[1:01:28] by the seventh angel.
[1:01:31] Praise the name of God. You know the
[1:01:33] truth was lost during the ages
[1:01:37] and then they started bringing it back.
[1:01:41] You know Martin Luther just shall live
[1:01:44] by faith.
[1:01:47] inance and saying that when I suffer
[1:01:50] that's when I'm
[1:01:57] just torment themselves
[1:02:00] and I think that is salutation
[1:02:03] that if I suffer too much
[1:02:05] God will have mercy on me
[1:02:08] and God says for you have suffered so
[1:02:10] much you can have mercy salvation
[1:02:15] the just shall live by him
[1:02:19] is of the Lord.
[1:02:22] So Martin Luther brought that truth
[1:02:26] but not all the truth
[1:02:29] and then John Wesley
[1:02:31] followed up after Martin Luther
[1:02:35] and then he preached about
[1:02:37] sanctification.
[1:02:40] You must be clean.
[1:02:43] God wants a clean vessel.
[1:02:46] As you have accepted the Lord Jesus as
[1:02:48] your personal savior
[1:02:51] and now every church is preaching the
[1:02:52] same.
[1:02:55] Ah, you be saved
[1:02:57] and everybody saying I'm safe.
[1:03:00] I'm
[1:03:06] ask
[1:03:09] and I also raised my hand that I want to
[1:03:10] get saved.
[1:03:12] They said me
[1:03:14] Jesus,
[1:03:16] I believe you to be my savior,
[1:03:18] you remove my name
[1:03:21] from the book of the dead and write it
[1:03:25] in the book of the living,
[1:03:29] wrong confession.
[1:03:32] There is no book of the dead.
[1:03:35] And right now, God is not writing the
[1:03:38] names in the book of life.
[1:03:43] The names were written before the
[1:03:44] foundation.
[1:03:48] So if you accept Jesus as your personal
[1:03:50] savior
[1:03:52] and you follow all the way,
[1:03:56] praise the name of receiving the spirit
[1:03:59] of God.
[1:04:01] It means your name was written
[1:04:05] before the foundation.
[1:04:07] Praise the name of the gospel preaching.
[1:04:13] You remove my name,
[1:04:15] those things are not there.
[1:04:20] The names were written before the world
[1:04:22] was made.
[1:04:25] In the Bible, there is no book of the
[1:04:27] dead. It is not there. Praise the name
[1:04:30] of So they make them have a wrong
[1:04:33] confession.
[1:04:38] Now what if you confess in the wrong
[1:04:39] way? If you make a wrong confession,
[1:04:44] are you saved? Praise the name of So you
[1:04:47] see the very beginning is bad.
[1:04:53] when he says that I'm
[1:04:58] going but the Bible says he that
[1:05:02] believeth
[1:05:05] the book of Mark
[1:05:07] chapter 16
[1:05:10] praise the name of our Lord Mark chapter
[1:05:12] 16
[1:05:14] and then verse 16
[1:05:16] it says he that believeth
[1:05:20] and is baptized
[1:05:23] shall be saved.
[1:05:26] Now for them,
[1:05:29] you already baptized when you were still
[1:05:31] a child.
[1:05:34] How did you believe when you were still
[1:05:35] a baby? So what they do? They bring
[1:05:39] false confessors
[1:05:47] or whatever they call them.
[1:05:49] auntie
[1:05:52] and then they say we going to baptize
[1:05:54] this child and then they come and stand
[1:05:57] there
[1:05:59] that they are confessing for the child
[1:06:03] wrong.
[1:06:05] So when you tell people you must believe
[1:06:11] they will tell you I was baptized when I
[1:06:14] was still young
[1:06:16] false
[1:06:19] see how they are held up
[1:06:22] and now they
[1:06:28] now they start thinking
[1:06:30] how how will I be able to to leave the
[1:06:32] other thing
[1:06:34] leave
[1:06:36] But it has to be the power of God
[1:06:40] that gives you the ability
[1:06:43] and that comes
[1:06:45] by your continuous yielding to the word
[1:06:47] of God.
[1:06:51] Before you hear the true word of God,
[1:06:55] the true word of God washes you.
[1:07:00] Our sanctification
[1:07:03] comes by the word of God.
[1:07:06] If you say you are saved
[1:07:09] and you're not hearing the true word of
[1:07:11] God,
[1:07:13] you are dirty
[1:07:15] and the spirit cannot come.
[1:07:18] Praise the name of our Lord. In
[1:07:20] Ephesians,
[1:07:24] praise the name of our Lord. Ephesians
[1:07:26] chapter 5
[1:07:29] and then verse 26
[1:07:32] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:07:34] with the washing of the water by the
[1:07:37] word.
[1:07:49] So it is the word of God.
[1:07:52] And what is the word of God?
[1:07:55] Because the Bible say that the gospel of
[1:07:58] the kingdom
[1:08:00] must be preached.
[1:08:03] What is the gospel of the kingdom
[1:08:06] at the time we are living?
[1:08:08] The gospel of the kingdom
[1:08:11] is what the spirit says
[1:08:14] to the church.
[1:08:17] That is the gospel of the king.
[1:08:20] What the spirit says
[1:08:22] by the message we have received.
[1:08:25] So now it's the message of the hour
[1:08:29] which is the ordained word of God
[1:08:33] that sanctifies us that cleans us. So
[1:08:37] when you outside of the message.
[1:08:42] Praise the name of no justification
[1:08:49] because
[1:08:50] what is judgment? What is unbelief
[1:08:56] is what God will judge.
[1:08:59] Unbelief in what?
[1:09:01] The word of God.
[1:09:03] Praise the name of Lord. So when they
[1:09:06] unbelieve the word of God,
[1:09:12] already condemned. So it's under the
[1:09:15] message of the hour
[1:09:18] that you can be justified.
[1:09:21] It's under the message of the hour that
[1:09:24] you can be sanctified.
[1:09:27] It's under the message of the hour that
[1:09:29] you can be filled with
[1:09:33] genuine baptism of the
[1:09:37] No matter
[1:09:45] now, what saved you?
[1:09:48] How have you got saved?
[1:09:51] What are you saved from?
[1:09:54] If you can't believe what the Lord is
[1:09:56] saying,
[1:09:59] praise the name of the Lord. So, we see
[1:10:01] that Satan is copying everything God has
[1:10:04] been doing.
[1:10:09] to hold people for himself
[1:10:14] people in our denomination.
[1:10:21] You know like when the movement of saved
[1:10:24] people was strong in the 80s
[1:10:30] was excommunicating people.
[1:10:36] Let's test them from
[1:10:42] buildings
[1:10:47] you know every every denomination.
[1:10:51] So now when they see that the youth are
[1:10:53] leaving their churches
[1:10:56] they know we better leave afternoon
[1:10:59] service for those people there.
[1:11:03] So they allowed the youth to come and
[1:11:04] take over
[1:11:10] you know the Bible says come out of
[1:11:13] Babylon.
[1:11:16] Babylon is organized religion.
[1:11:20] You have been a denomination
[1:11:22] and then you say you are saved. What are
[1:11:24] you saved from? When you are saying the
[1:11:27] same thing God has
[1:11:31] organized religion,
[1:11:34] organized religion,
[1:11:36] you know, rejects the leadership of the
[1:11:38] Holy Spirit.
[1:11:40] They have the leadership of men
[1:11:44] and they don't have room for the Holy
[1:11:46] Spirit.
[1:11:49] That's
[1:11:52] mystery.
[1:11:54] Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[1:11:57] the message of the hour.
[1:12:00] And the message of the hour. Praise the
[1:12:03] name of our Lord is the one that turns
[1:12:06] our hearts
[1:12:09] back to the apostolic fathers.
[1:12:13] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:12:14] original Bible faith.
[1:12:18] is restored by the seventh angel.
[1:12:24] So now anything outside of the message
[1:12:29] is an impersonation.
[1:12:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Anything
[1:12:40] outside of the message of the hour,
[1:12:43] let me put it the other way around.
[1:12:46] Anything outside of God's ordained way
[1:12:52] is an impersonation.
[1:12:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:13:00] seven church age book
[1:13:05] page 327
[1:13:11] and then paragraph one it says now this
[1:13:16] message of 4
[1:13:19] and revelation 107
[1:13:22] is going to do two things.
[1:13:26] Praise the name of the Lord. I hope
[1:13:29] every one of us has got their church
[1:13:31] age.
[1:13:34] Praise the name of because if you don't
[1:13:37] have the seven church age,
[1:13:41] you really need to get one.
[1:13:43] You have both the Luganda copies
[1:13:47] and even the English copies.
[1:13:49] Each and every one of us should have
[1:13:51] them.
[1:13:53] And every day these days
[1:13:57] We have a teaching on the seven church
[1:14:00] ages
[1:14:03] and I would every one of us
[1:14:07] especially those who have this
[1:14:08] smartphone
[1:14:12] and you need to be on the church forum
[1:14:16] such that you can receive the daily
[1:14:18] teaching on the seven church.
[1:14:23] Right now in the we in the church age of
[1:14:25] sim
[1:14:27] page 113 of the church age book
[1:14:32] and I believe the whole year we're going
[1:14:33] to be on that seven church age book
[1:14:35] every day
[1:14:40] take your time
[1:14:43] open your phoneain
[1:14:51] but for
[1:14:54] It can run the whole night and the whole
[1:14:56] day.
[1:14:58] But now this morning exultation,
[1:15:04] it may not even take more than three.
[1:15:10] How much?
[1:15:13] You can afford it.
[1:15:16] Take time.
[1:15:18] The exultation may be 20 to 30 minutes.
[1:15:25] Take time and listen.
[1:15:28] Take time and read the things.
[1:15:31] Praise the name of the Lord. It will
[1:15:33] help to stand stronger.
[1:15:37] Praise the name of the Lord. But many
[1:15:40] times you find few people are responding
[1:15:42] to them.
[1:15:45] And when you look at our church forum
[1:15:50] and then
[1:15:51] You see we are in hundreds of people
[1:15:58] and then you start wondering
[1:16:00] how about others we about 165
[1:16:06] on the forum
[1:16:08] but how many listen
[1:16:12] but then sometimes it is interesting
[1:16:15] you can go to the church forum
[1:16:18] and then you find 10 people 15 people
[1:16:21] online
[1:16:25] but they have no time for the forum
[1:16:28] either on this one here the other one
[1:16:31] there
[1:16:36] we need to take time and take these
[1:16:38] things serious
[1:16:41] praise the name of our lord let us take
[1:16:43] time
[1:16:45] you know if the lord has chosen a
[1:16:46] certain path
[1:16:50] is for our good. Praise the name of God.
[1:16:54] Say that you are able to overcome the
[1:16:56] time we are living in.
[1:16:59] The message that we have got is the one
[1:17:03] that gives us the ability
[1:17:05] to overcome the evil spirits of the
[1:17:07] time.
[1:17:10] But if the message is far away from you,
[1:17:13] then you know the demons are going to
[1:17:15] take a hold of you.
[1:17:18] they are going to give other suggestion.
[1:17:22] You can be on Facebook
[1:17:24] like on Tik Tok after one after one kind
[1:17:28] of Tik Tok
[1:17:32] another comes another comes another
[1:17:34] comes you'll find that you want that or
[1:17:37] even Facebook Facebook from this one oh
[1:17:39] again there is this one there's this one
[1:17:41] here this one
[1:17:45] we need to take time in the things of
[1:17:46] the lord
[1:17:48] praise the name of our lord so here he
[1:17:50] says in the seven church book
[1:17:54] page 327 paragraph one.
[1:17:58] Now this messenger
[1:18:01] of Malachi 4 is going to do two things
[1:18:07] one according to Malachi 4
[1:18:11] he will turn the hearts of the children
[1:18:15] to the fathers.
[1:18:19] So there is no way Our hearts can be
[1:18:23] turned
[1:18:25] to the Bible truth
[1:18:28] without the messenger
[1:18:30] of the seventh angel.
[1:18:34] Revelations 10:7.
[1:18:36] Then he says two,
[1:18:39] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:18:41] seven sanders
[1:18:45] in Revelation 10,
[1:18:48] which are the revelations.
[1:18:51] contained in the seven seals.
[1:18:57] It will be this divinely revealed
[1:18:59] mystery truth
[1:19:03] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:19:06] children
[1:19:09] to the Pentecostal fathers.
[1:19:14] Praise the name of the Lord. So it is
[1:19:16] the revelation of the word
[1:19:20] that turns our hearts
[1:19:24] back to the Bible truth.
[1:19:27] Baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:30] Baptism by immersion.
[1:19:32] God being one,
[1:19:35] not a trinity.
[1:19:37] Women not preaching.
[1:19:40] Praise the name of our Lord. A lot of
[1:19:43] Bible truth.
[1:19:45] Praise the name of our Lord because
[1:19:47] that's what the apostles were believing.
[1:19:50] So then we have the message of the hour
[1:19:54] that takes us back to this Bible.
[1:19:58] And that's what John
[1:20:01] was being told.
[1:20:03] Go and eat that book
[1:20:06] because the book was open.
[1:20:09] We have got an open book.
[1:20:12] So you go and get the message of the
[1:20:14] hour.
[1:20:15] You eat it. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:20:19] And the Bible say it is sweet like honey
[1:20:22] in the mouth.
[1:20:24] But then it is bitter in the belly.
[1:20:27] But what do you do? You must prophesy
[1:20:30] again.
[1:20:32] You go and testify about this.
[1:20:36] Tell it. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:20:39] The Bible says what you hear in the
[1:20:42] bedroom
[1:20:43] or in the bed chamber,
[1:20:46] go and tell it on the rooftop.
[1:20:50] Tell others about it. That's what Paul
[1:20:53] was doing.
[1:20:55] Go and tell them how the Lord Jesus met
[1:20:58] him. Even after 20 or 30 years,
[1:21:03] that experience was fresh in his life.
[1:21:07] Even you The time you came in the
[1:21:10] message,
[1:21:12] the time God opened your eyes
[1:21:15] and you knew this is the truth. Testify
[1:21:18] about that. Tell somebody else about
[1:21:21] that.
[1:21:22] Praise the name of God. Don't be ashamed
[1:21:26] of your conversion or your belief in the
[1:21:29] message of the hour. Tell them I was in
[1:21:32] scripture union and then they told us
[1:21:35] about ABCD
[1:21:37] but then they were telling us that the
[1:21:40] message of the hour is false. Then what
[1:21:44] happened and then you tell them about
[1:21:46] how the Lord opened your eyes. I was in
[1:21:49] this kind of denomination
[1:21:51] and then I heard the truth like there's
[1:21:54] a brother yesterday.
[1:21:56] He's a pastor in one of the churches in.
[1:22:00] And then he said he first heard the
[1:22:03] message of the hour
[1:22:06] on our radio programs
[1:22:09] and then a sister told his sister told
[1:22:12] him. There is a message they they put on
[1:22:15] the the radio.
[1:22:18] Go and listen to it.
[1:22:20] And so he turned up for that Friday
[1:22:22] program.
[1:22:24] when he heard he said his heart was
[1:22:27] complet completely settled
[1:22:30] and then he started looking for where
[1:22:33] are these people I want to be baptized
[1:22:36] in the name of Jesus Christ I want to
[1:22:38] take all this message
[1:22:40] and he says he's not comfortable
[1:22:47] anything outside of the message but his
[1:22:50] heart is always rejoicing when he hears
[1:22:51] the message
[1:22:54] Go and tell it to the world.
[1:22:57] Praise the name of our Lord. Tell
[1:22:59] others.
[1:23:00] Let others know.
[1:23:03] God has sent us a prophet.
[1:23:05] And that prophet has revealed all the
[1:23:08] mysteries of God.
[1:23:11] And this is where the the the light of
[1:23:14] God is.
[1:23:16] This is where the salvation of God is.
[1:23:20] Praise the name of our Lord. preparing
[1:23:22] people for the second coming of the
[1:23:23] Lord.
[1:23:26] So he says the message of Malachi 4 is
[1:23:30] meant to do two things.
[1:23:33] The first thing
[1:23:35] praise the name of our Lord to turn the
[1:23:37] hearts
[1:23:39] of the children
[1:23:41] to the fathers.
[1:23:44] talk to them about the Bible truth we
[1:23:46] have
[1:23:48] because it is these mysteries
[1:23:51] that will turn the heart of the elect.
[1:23:56] It is these mysteries that catch the ego
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:06] not eating
[1:24:16] But there's something higher than that.
[1:24:19] We want to get the eos.
[1:24:27] But the eagles look in the sky. Praise
[1:24:30] the name of our Lord. They pick up those
[1:24:32] mysteries.
[1:24:35] They pick up those prophecy.
[1:24:38] They pick up the revelations.
[1:24:41] That is ego food.
[1:24:44] Praise the name of And these are the
[1:24:46] things we need to take out.
[1:24:49] You must prophesy again.
[1:24:52] But how will you prophesy
[1:24:55] if you have not eaten the book?
[1:24:59] Praise the name of our Lord. How are you
[1:25:01] going to prophesy
[1:25:03] if you have no time
[1:25:05] to listen to the daily exaltation
[1:25:10] teaching on the church age book
[1:25:12] and just don't have time
[1:25:15] or you just go on your bed and then you
[1:25:18] lie down when is playing
[1:25:22] then you're also sleeping
[1:25:25] you're not eating
[1:25:27] you need to be attentive
[1:25:31] Where is the spirit flowing?
[1:25:35] Praise the name of how is the spirit
[1:25:37] going here?
[1:25:39] Where is the spirit taking us?
[1:25:42] Like I believe it was the Friday
[1:25:44] exaltation.
[1:25:46] You know where you know El
[1:25:50] was telling Elishah
[1:25:53] if you see me taken away from you.
[1:25:57] Now Elisha had to be attentive.
[1:26:01] The same thing with us. You have to be
[1:26:04] attentive.
[1:26:06] When the spirit turns this area,
[1:26:09] you are following. When the spirit turns
[1:26:11] this area, you are following just like
[1:26:14] when brother was under discernment.
[1:26:18] You know there are people in the line in
[1:26:19] the prayer line.
[1:26:21] So the Holy Ghost will be discerning
[1:26:23] this person.
[1:26:24] The Holy Ghost can leave this person and
[1:26:27] then it goes to somebody in the back.
[1:26:30] He has to follow where the spirit was
[1:26:32] maybe goes in the back then again comes
[1:26:35] to the front maybe goes you know to the
[1:26:38] balconies
[1:26:40] you just have to follow the leadership
[1:26:42] of God
[1:26:43] and that's the same thing with us. We
[1:26:46] need to be led by the spirit.
[1:26:50] So it is the mysteries
[1:26:52] which are revealed
[1:26:55] that turn our hearts
[1:26:58] to the apostolic fathers.
[1:27:01] But if you don't know those mysteries,
[1:27:03] you've not heard of those mysteries.
[1:27:06] How is your heart going to be touched?
[1:27:10] Praise the name of Lord. So we need to
[1:27:12] see that we take the message very
[1:27:13] serious.
[1:27:16] Read these books. Hear these sermons.
[1:27:20] Take time.
[1:27:22] Meditate upon these things.
[1:27:25] Think about them. And after you have
[1:27:28] thought about it,
[1:27:30] they are part of you.
[1:27:33] Take them to another person
[1:27:35] and start testifying.
[1:27:38] God has sent us a message.
[1:27:40] We have a message of the hour.
[1:27:43] You must prophesy again.
[1:27:47] But you prophesy
[1:27:48] what you have. But if you don't have it,
[1:27:52] how are you going to another person?
[1:27:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Yet we are
[1:27:57] meant to prophesy.
[1:28:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we see
[1:28:03] here that the book of mysteries,
[1:28:08] the seven sealed book,
[1:28:12] praise the name of our Lord, is the same
[1:28:15] book
[1:28:17] which is the lamb's book of life.
[1:28:23] Praise the name of our Lord. And that
[1:28:25] same lamb's book
[1:28:28] which he had the names which were meant
[1:28:30] to come,
[1:28:33] Adam lost it
[1:28:36] in the garden of Eden.
[1:28:39] Now in the message revelation 5,
[1:28:44] brother says now our redeemer, our
[1:28:48] kinsman is handed the seven sealed book
[1:28:51] of redemption.
[1:28:58] He handed the seven sealed book of
[1:29:00] redemption.
[1:29:05] original owner.
[1:29:09] The original owner
[1:29:11] when we lost it at the garden of Adam,
[1:29:15] when we left it at the garden of Eden
[1:29:19] through Adam,
[1:29:21] it went back to the original owner.
[1:29:25] So, Adam had the book of life.
[1:29:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Now still
[1:29:32] in the in the message the bridge between
[1:29:34] the seven church ages and the seven
[1:29:36] seals.
[1:29:40] He says
[1:29:44] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:29:48] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:29:52] the book
[1:29:53] and to lose the seven seals thereof.
[1:29:57] Now remember, let us read first verse
[1:30:00] again.
[1:30:02] So we get it together. I saw in the
[1:30:05] right hand of him that sat upon
[1:30:10] God. Who is that? The absolutely
[1:30:14] original holder of the book of life.
[1:30:20] He holds it.
[1:30:22] God does.
[1:30:25] When Adam for it,
[1:30:30] it went back to the original owner.
[1:30:35] So now when you see that it is a sealed
[1:30:38] book
[1:30:40] and it is sealed with seven seals.
[1:30:44] That is the book which has all the
[1:30:47] names.
[1:30:50] That seven sealed book
[1:30:53] is the book of redemption.
[1:30:56] That seven sealed book
[1:31:00] praise the name of our Lord is the book
[1:31:02] of life.
[1:31:03] It's not a different book. So, Adam had
[1:31:06] the book of life.
[1:31:09] So, now when he lost that book,
[1:31:12] it went to the hands of God.
[1:31:15] And when Christ picks it, it's the book
[1:31:18] of redemption.
[1:31:20] It's not different.
[1:31:22] It is the same book.
[1:31:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the
[1:31:27] message greater than Solomon is here,
[1:31:30] he says, "Grant it, Lord.
[1:31:34] that the kingdom of God will soon be
[1:31:36] established in the earth.
[1:31:41] You are coming for your delegates.
[1:31:44] One day the lamb is going to leave the
[1:31:48] sanctuary.
[1:31:51] Come forth to take the book out of the
[1:31:53] right hand of him that sat on him.
[1:32:00] When man transgressed
[1:32:03] and the book of life went to its
[1:32:05] original owner,
[1:32:10] man,
[1:32:12] all life was lost.
[1:32:14] And there was no man in heaven or on
[1:32:18] earth that was worthy.
[1:32:21] But a lamb come forth,
[1:32:25] a blood lamb,
[1:32:28] that had been slain since the foundation
[1:32:31] of the world
[1:32:34] that come and took the book of
[1:32:36] redemption
[1:32:39] and opened it.
[1:32:42] Praise the name of our Lord. God, may my
[1:32:45] name be there.
[1:32:48] May every name here be written there
[1:32:52] that has been redeemed
[1:32:55] in this great plan of redemption.
[1:32:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So the book
[1:33:01] of life
[1:33:02] is the book of redemption
[1:33:05] and that's the same book that was sealed
[1:33:08] with seven se.
[1:33:12] It's not different. It was with Adam.
[1:33:16] when Adam lost it,
[1:33:19] Christ comes and receives it. You know,
[1:33:22] Adam in Genesis one and then verse 26,
[1:33:28] that's why he had the book
[1:33:30] because the Bible said, God made man in
[1:33:33] his own image
[1:33:36] and his own likeness.
[1:33:38] So, Adam was the son of God. He was made
[1:33:42] in the image of God. He was made in the
[1:33:45] likeness of God.
[1:33:47] Adam had the ability to bring children
[1:33:52] who are sons of God. But now when sin
[1:33:55] came in Genesis chapter 3,
[1:33:58] Adam lost that book.
[1:34:02] Adam lost that ability
[1:34:06] to bring children
[1:34:08] who are in the image of God and in the
[1:34:11] likeness of God.
[1:34:13] Adam Adam lost the book of life.
[1:34:17] Adam lost the ability
[1:34:21] to call the names which are in the book
[1:34:23] of life. But our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:27] give us back that ability.
[1:34:30] Praise the name of Lord. In Adam we were
[1:34:34] born to die
[1:34:36] but in Christ we are born to live
[1:34:39] eternally.
[1:34:41] That's why Jesus said unless a man is
[1:34:44] born again
[1:34:46] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[1:34:50] It is only the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:34:53] will receive eternal life.
[1:34:56] Adam had that ability before
[1:34:59] the sin he lost the ability to bring
[1:35:03] children who are eternal. He instead
[1:35:07] produced children who died. Praise the
[1:35:11] name of our Lord. But now we are living
[1:35:13] at the time
[1:35:15] that if you have heard your name in the
[1:35:17] book,
[1:35:19] you can also call another name.
[1:35:22] Praise the name of our Lord. How do you
[1:35:24] call another name out?
[1:35:27] You must prophesy.
[1:35:30] Praise the name of our Lord. the message
[1:35:32] you had received
[1:35:34] because the message calls your name out
[1:35:37] of the book of life.
[1:35:39] When you receive the message and so if
[1:35:42] you have the message, you can also call
[1:35:44] another name out of the book.
[1:35:48] How do you call another name out of it?
[1:35:50] You must prophesy.
[1:35:54] Tell them God has sent us a message.
[1:35:57] Tell them we have a mercy praying us for
[1:35:58] the coming of the
[1:36:02] Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[1:36:04] the book of life.
[1:36:06] We have the book of redemption.
[1:36:09] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[1:36:11] message, the seat shall not be here with
[1:36:12] the SH.
[1:36:15] He says that's why the rapture,
[1:36:19] the bride, the wise virgin,
[1:36:23] the called out, the four ordained,
[1:36:27] the elected.
[1:36:29] Why? Then he says, "You businessman
[1:36:33] would not run your office like some
[1:36:35] people try to think that God runs his
[1:36:37] program.
[1:36:56] Let me save this one.
[1:37:00] Maybe he will leave. God knew things
[1:37:03] before the foundation.
[1:37:06] Praise the name of Lord. So if God has
[1:37:09] opened your eyes
[1:37:11] to the message of the earth,
[1:37:14] don't think about backsliding.
[1:37:18] Don't think about it. God is not that
[1:37:21] person
[1:37:23] to bring you from there to destroy
[1:37:26] somewhere else. No.
[1:37:29] That's what brother is talking about.
[1:37:37] Just have faith in God and then you'll
[1:37:40] have enough strength to overcome.
[1:37:45] The thing of it is learn to call upon
[1:37:48] the name of the Lord.
[1:37:50] When you are stuck, Lord, I'm stuck.
[1:37:56] Confess it.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] Don't be
[1:38:06] understand.
[1:38:08] Even him wants to see what you you will
[1:38:10] do and also waiting for
[1:38:14] I don't know what I'm going to do.
[1:38:18] Even God is wondering why don't you know
[1:38:20] what you are going to do. When he says
[1:38:23] whoever shall call upon the name of the
[1:38:25] Lord
[1:38:27] shall be delivered.
[1:38:32] Go and pick the promises of God
[1:38:36] which relate with the situation you are
[1:38:38] going through
[1:38:41] and then talk to the God. Lord you
[1:38:43] promised me Lord you promised like
[1:38:46] Daniel
[1:38:48] the Bible say
[1:38:51] understood by book
[1:38:55] how about you
[1:38:56] You have to understand by books,
[1:39:00] understand by the message of the
[1:39:03] time that we are living.
[1:39:06] Daniel knew that the 70 years had come
[1:39:10] and God was waiting to find out
[1:39:13] who of them is concerned about what I
[1:39:15] put in the book
[1:39:19] who is concerned so that you go to God
[1:39:22] in prayer.
[1:39:23] Lord, you promised this. Lord, you
[1:39:26] promised this. Lord, you promised this.
[1:39:29] Take your condition.
[1:39:31] Take your situation
[1:39:33] and bring it to the Lord and say, "Lord,
[1:39:36] according to your word,
[1:39:38] you've told me in Isaiah one
[1:39:43] verse 16 and verse 18, that all my sins
[1:39:46] be as red as
[1:39:56] They shall be white as snow.
[1:39:59] So you don't look at your dirt sins.
[1:40:02] Look at being as white as snow.
[1:40:06] And then you mention it to God.
[1:40:09] I have this weakness.
[1:40:11] Lord, there's a promise here that I can
[1:40:14] overcome and I want to overcome.
[1:40:17] Praise the name of the Lord. I say we
[1:40:19] live a victorious life.
[1:40:21] Praise the name of the Lord. It's by
[1:40:23] depending upon God,
[1:40:27] they that wait upon the Lord, they shall
[1:40:30] renew their spirit.
[1:40:33] Master waiting on the Lord,
[1:40:37] you master it.
[1:40:40] How you can wait on the Lord. Have time
[1:40:43] for the Lord.
[1:40:44] Time to pray to him. Time to read his
[1:40:47] word to think about time about it and
[1:40:52] then you'll become stronger.
[1:40:57] Praise the name of God. Like an eagle,
[1:41:00] you know, an eagle flies.
[1:41:03] You should not be flying also.
[1:41:06] Take the message. You must prophesy.
[1:41:10] Praise the name of the Lord. So then he
[1:41:12] says here,
[1:41:14] God knew
[1:41:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:19] who would be saved and would not be
[1:41:22] saved by predestination
[1:41:25] by foreign knowledge.
[1:41:28] He knew every member,
[1:41:31] put every name on the lamb's book of
[1:41:34] life
[1:41:37] before the church ever began.
[1:41:42] Jesus come to seek and save
[1:41:47] that which was on the book.
[1:41:51] He bought the book of redemption.
[1:41:55] It was lost and he redeemed us and all
[1:42:00] names on that book
[1:42:03] was redeemed
[1:42:05] when he redeemed us. Are you part of the
[1:42:08] redeemed?
[1:42:10] Amen.
[1:42:17] Why have you come to church?
[1:42:20] We have come to testify. I know my name
[1:42:24] is in the book of life.
[1:42:26] Praise the name of God and you know the
[1:42:28] names are called
[1:42:31] by the word of God.
[1:42:34] You check your desire about the word of
[1:42:35] God.
[1:42:38] If the word of God means nothing,
[1:42:43] there's something wrong with your life.
[1:42:46] But if the word of God is so dear to
[1:42:48] you,
[1:42:51] that means your name is written.
[1:42:55] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:42:57] there's another quote here which I
[1:42:58] liked.
[1:43:01] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:43:04] In the message the invisible union of
[1:43:06] the bride of Christ
[1:43:10] 307
[1:43:12] he says that's my message to you church
[1:43:18] you
[1:43:23] spiritual union
[1:43:26] by the word
[1:43:29] praise the name of the lord that should
[1:43:31] be your desire
[1:43:33] Let me be united with the world.
[1:43:37] Praise the name of the Lord. Let me be
[1:43:39] one with the world.
[1:43:42] And now the Lord Jesus saying,
[1:43:45] you in me,
[1:43:47] I in you.
[1:43:50] Lord, my desire
[1:43:54] is to be in you. Praise the name of our
[1:43:57] Lord. My desire is to be in you, Lord.
[1:44:01] That should be your heart's desire.
[1:44:04] Lord, I want to be in you.
[1:44:06] Praise the name of a question. Sometimes
[1:44:09] I go out in the missions and ask people.
[1:44:14] I can ask the same question. Now,
[1:44:16] how many of us want to go to heaven?
[1:44:21] Some some are not sure.
[1:44:24] There is a better heaven than earth.
[1:44:27] So many of us want to go to heaven.
[1:44:30] all of us. But the Bible say
[1:44:34] heaven will pass away.
[1:44:37] So where are you going to be?
[1:44:41] Praise the name of the Bible says heaven
[1:44:45] and earth are going to pass away.
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:49] Now where are you going to be?
[1:44:52] Amen.
[1:44:54] I'm going to
[1:44:57] the Bible says
[1:44:59] will pass away. Where will you be?
[1:45:03] Praise the name of Lord. We can pick
[1:45:06] that scripture.
[1:45:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Let me get
[1:45:10] the verse here
[1:45:13] where the Bible says heaven and earth
[1:45:14] will pass away.
[1:45:18] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:45:25] Okay, we go to
[1:45:29] we go to Matthew
[1:45:33] 24:35.
[1:45:39] Now the Bible says
[1:45:42] heaven is going to pass away
[1:45:44] is going to pass away but what cannot
[1:45:47] pass away the word.
[1:45:50] So when heaven is passing away and earth
[1:45:54] is passing away be in the word.
[1:45:58] Praise the name of So when the heaven is
[1:46:00] passing away when the earth is passing
[1:46:03] away I'm in the word and you don't wait
[1:46:07] for that time to be in the word.
[1:46:11] Get in the word.
[1:46:14] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:46:15] safe you can be. Whoever the word
[1:46:18] desires you to be.
[1:46:20] You will be there. If the word wants you
[1:46:22] to be in heaven,
[1:46:24] you'll be in heaven. If the word wants
[1:46:26] you to be on earth, you'll be on the
[1:46:28] earth. If the word want you to be in the
[1:46:30] air, you'll be in the air.
[1:46:33] How the word of God is so rich right
[1:46:36] now. The word of God want you to be on
[1:46:39] earth. Why does it want you to be on
[1:46:42] earth now? that you may prophesy again.
[1:46:46] And then get other people, you also get
[1:46:49] in the word. When your time to sleep
[1:46:52] comes,
[1:46:55] the word takes you to heaven.
[1:46:58] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[1:46:59] rapture comes, the Bible says we shall
[1:47:03] be in the air with Christ again. The
[1:47:05] word will put you in the air.
[1:47:08] So just be in the word and the word will
[1:47:12] take you to the right places.
[1:47:14] Praise the name of when you are in the
[1:47:17] word now.
[1:47:19] You not go to the disco.
[1:47:22] Praise the name of when you in the word.
[1:47:25] You not go to the bar.
[1:47:28] Praise the name of Lord. When you in the
[1:47:30] word, you'll not go to pool tables and
[1:47:38] when you in the word, you not go to, you
[1:47:41] know, betting boosters.
[1:47:47] No, the word will not take you there.
[1:47:51] The word, praise the name of our Lord,
[1:47:53] will take you to places he's happy with.
[1:47:57] Praise the name of God. So we need to be
[1:48:00] in the word.
[1:48:02] Praise the name of God. So then he says
[1:48:04] here in that message that we must be in
[1:48:07] a spiritual union by God.
[1:48:12] Praise the name of God. Then he says if
[1:48:15] you are born again
[1:48:17] that little jump that was predestinated
[1:48:20] to you
[1:48:23] it is word coming on word
[1:48:29] on word
[1:48:31] come into full stature of Christ.
[1:48:36] That is right. So he can come
[1:48:42] to get his bride.
[1:48:44] We are just ready for one thing,
[1:48:48] the coming of the Lord. Praise the name
[1:48:50] of the Lord. Then he says there is your
[1:48:53] name
[1:48:58] on the book of life. And he says the
[1:49:02] book of life is the word of God.
[1:49:06] Praise the name of So now when you get
[1:49:10] the word of God,
[1:49:12] you are hearing your name.
[1:49:15] Praise the name of So it's not that
[1:49:17] maybe it is this and this.
[1:49:20] But the word of God
[1:49:22] is the book of life and the word of God
[1:49:26] is where your identity is.
[1:49:32] Your being
[1:49:35] is in the word of God. That's why you
[1:49:37] need to be united.
[1:49:40] Let the word dwell in you.
[1:49:44] Why? That's your identity.
[1:49:48] Praise the name of our Lord. The word of
[1:49:50] God is the book of life.
[1:49:54] The word of God is where the names are
[1:49:56] written.
[1:49:58] Praise the name of God. Like when you go
[1:50:00] for a role,
[1:50:04] maybe you in class or maybe a big
[1:50:07] congregation
[1:50:09] and people are very happy
[1:50:13] to hear their names being mentioned.
[1:50:17] Ah brother so and so.
[1:50:20] Oh Mr. and so everybody would want
[1:50:26] that's what the word does.
[1:50:29] You want to hear your name.
[1:50:32] So even you if you know your name is in
[1:50:35] the word of God
[1:50:38] cherish the word of God.
[1:50:40] Oh I want to hear my name.
[1:50:43] But now these rich people. They get top
[1:50:46] musicians
[1:50:48] and then they sing a song in their name.
[1:50:59] I think it's called
[1:51:02] something. So everybody puts that song.
[1:51:07] Now somebody may not sing about your
[1:51:09] name,
[1:51:11] but the Bible sings about
[1:51:14] when you take it in your heart. You
[1:51:17] become the reflection of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:21] Praise the name of the bride of Jesus
[1:51:23] Christ.
[1:51:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:51:27] says the book of life is the word of God
[1:51:32] because the word
[1:51:34] is God and God is the only thing that is
[1:51:39] life. So your name
[1:51:43] was represented in the Bible
[1:51:47] before the Bible become
[1:51:50] praise the name of God. So the name
[1:51:54] in the book Receive the word.
[1:51:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:52:01] message questions and answers,
[1:52:04] he says
[1:52:07] nothing
[1:52:08] will be saved
[1:52:11] only those whose names were put on the
[1:52:13] Lamb's book of life
[1:52:18] before the foundation of the world.
[1:52:22] Jew or Gentile,
[1:52:27] that is all.
[1:52:29] The book holds that mystery
[1:52:34] and the book is only unfolding it now,
[1:52:40] not
[1:52:42] not each each one's name,
[1:52:46] but what the mystery of the book is.
[1:52:51] what it the book is while it is calling
[1:52:54] those names.
[1:52:57] So when you hear the mystery
[1:53:01] of the book or what is written in the
[1:53:04] book and then you receive the mystery
[1:53:08] you get the revelation
[1:53:11] that's your name being called out.
[1:53:15] So you receive Christ
[1:53:17] by revelation.
[1:53:20] Praise the name of God. Like Peter,
[1:53:23] Jesus was asking him, "Who do men say
[1:53:26] that I the son of God?"
[1:53:29] And then he's saying, "You are Christ
[1:53:32] the son of the living." And then Jesus
[1:53:35] tells him,
[1:53:37] "You have not learned of men.
[1:53:40] You have not learned of fresh and blood.
[1:53:43] But my father which is in heaven
[1:53:46] has revealed this to you."
[1:53:49] So the question is, has it also been
[1:53:51] revealed to you? When it has been
[1:53:54] revealed to you,
[1:53:56] then you've heard your name.
[1:53:58] Praise the name of Lord. And so as our
[1:54:02] names have been called,
[1:54:04] we have believed the mysteries of the
[1:54:06] Bible.
[1:54:08] We have received the revelation of the
[1:54:10] word of God.
[1:54:12] Let us go and prophesy.
[1:54:15] Tell it to others. Testify to them.
[1:54:19] We have the truth. We have the message
[1:54:21] of the hour preparing us for the
[1:54:24] rapture.
[1:54:25] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:54:27] their names can be called out.
[1:54:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:54:32] says,
[1:54:34] you understand that the book doesn't say
[1:54:39] now Levi
[1:54:42] is going to be saved in this time of
[1:54:44] this church age.
[1:54:50] or
[1:54:52] no, it doesn't say that. It just shows
[1:54:56] the mystery,
[1:54:58] unfolds the mystery
[1:55:01] of what the thing is,
[1:55:05] but we ourselves
[1:55:08] by faith
[1:55:10] believe it. Praise the name of our names
[1:55:13] called.
[1:55:15] So that's why he say that it is the
[1:55:18] mystery truth
[1:55:21] that turn the hearts of the children
[1:55:26] to the fathers.
[1:55:29] Praise the name of so you have what you
[1:55:31] can prophesy.
[1:55:34] If you have found your name in the book,
[1:55:37] you can also open the door to others.
[1:55:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Like the
[1:55:43] Lord Jesus saying, I have the keys of
[1:55:47] death and hell, but the keys of life,
[1:55:51] keys to the kingdom of God
[1:55:54] he has given to us. So if the door has
[1:55:57] been opened to you,
[1:55:59] if you have heard your name being called
[1:56:01] from the book,
[1:56:03] you have also got the ability
[1:56:06] to call the names of others
[1:56:09] from the book. If you have already
[1:56:11] entered into the kingdom,
[1:56:14] you have the ability.
[1:56:16] You have the key to open the door for
[1:56:19] others.
[1:56:20] How do you open others enter into the
[1:56:22] kingdom? Testify about the Lord Jesus
[1:56:25] Christ.
[1:56:26] Tell them we have a message. Tell them
[1:56:28] we have salvation.
[1:56:31] Tell them to be ready for life.
[1:56:33] You are opening the door to them.
[1:56:36] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:56:38] it works. You must prophesy.
[1:56:43] Praise the name of our Lord. How many of
[1:56:45] us are going to prophesy?
[1:56:47] Yeah. We start immediately
[1:56:50] in your family. Tell them what you
[1:56:52] believe, where you work. Tell them what
[1:56:55] you believe. Your neighbors, tell them
[1:56:58] what you believe. Praise the name of
[1:57:01] God. Or maybe you have gone to the salon
[1:57:04] or they are cutting your hair or you are
[1:57:07] sitting at your home or another woman is
[1:57:11] making your hair.
[1:57:14] Prophesy to them.
[1:57:16] Tell them, "We have a message.
[1:57:19] We have a message that changes people's
[1:57:21] life.
[1:57:22] We have a message that can bring true
[1:57:25] children and daughters of God.
[1:57:29] Tell them about the goodness of God.
[1:57:32] Praise the name of our Lord. You must
[1:57:34] prophesy.
[1:57:37] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:57:38] what the Lord
[1:57:40] is looking upon us.
[1:57:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:57:45] turn to the timeline of the prophet.
[1:57:49] Praise the name of our Lord. God sent us
[1:57:52] a prophet.
[1:57:55] Praise the name of our Lord. We can pick
[1:57:57] up some scriptures.
[1:57:59] Now in chapter 3
[1:58:03] and then verse 7 verse 8,
[1:58:07] praise the name of our Lord.
[1:58:10] 3
[1:58:14] verse 7 verse 8.
[1:58:17] The Bible says, "Surely the Lord will do
[1:58:20] nothing, but he revealth his secrets
[1:58:23] unto his servants, the prophets. The
[1:58:25] lion has roared. Who will not fear? The
[1:58:29] Lord has spoken. Who can but prophecy?"
[1:58:48] praise the name of our Lord. So the word
[1:58:50] of God
[1:58:52] comes to the prophet
[1:58:54] and the Bible promised us that in the
[1:58:58] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:59:03] in Revelations 10:7
[1:59:05] that the seventh angel. Now this angel
[1:59:09] is talking about
[1:59:11] is the angel of the church of loudia
[1:59:16] in revelations 3 verse 14
[1:59:19] where he says unto the angel of the
[1:59:22] church of loudia
[1:59:24] write these things says the amen
[1:59:29] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:59:32] of the creation of
[1:59:34] so you see that in revelation
[1:59:37] Chapter 3 verse 14
[1:59:40] is saying
[1:59:42] amen.
[1:59:44] When does a man come? At the end. So is
[1:59:48] the seventh angel
[1:59:51] who has been given the mystery
[1:59:54] to come and reveal it to the child.
[1:59:58] Praise the name of Lord. And even now we
[2:00:01] see that in Revelation 10.
[2:00:05] Praise the name of our Lord, Revelation
[2:00:08] 10.
[2:00:10] And then verse six, the Bible says,
[2:00:15] "And swear by him that liveth forever
[2:00:18] and ever, who created the heaven and the
[2:00:21] things that are in, and the earth, and
[2:00:23] the things that are in, that the sea and
[2:00:25] the things that are in, that there
[2:00:27] should be time no longer.
[2:00:43] So when does that happen?
[2:00:46] In the seventh church age,
[2:00:51] you know that's when the mysteries are
[2:00:53] revealed.
[2:00:55] So the mysteries are revealed
[2:00:58] at the end time
[2:01:01] and the mysteries
[2:01:03] have been revealed.
[2:01:05] Praise the name of Lord. So we are at
[2:01:08] the end time.
[2:01:10] God has sent us a prophet
[2:01:14] William.
[2:01:16] The denominational world
[2:01:18] they don't want it.
[2:01:21] They don't want somebody to talk about
[2:01:23] speak about it.
[2:01:25] But God has sent a prophet
[2:01:28] with a message in this end time
[2:01:31] that prepares people for the second
[2:01:34] coming of the Lord.
[2:01:36] We have a message. You must prophesy
[2:01:41] and tell others. How will they know if
[2:01:45] you don't tell them?
[2:01:47] Praise the name of the Lord. How did you
[2:01:49] know?
[2:01:51] if somebody didn't tell you. So we have
[2:01:53] a responsibility
[2:01:55] to tell others,
[2:01:57] we have a message that prepares us for
[2:02:00] the rapture.
[2:02:02] Praise the name of our Lord. So we see
[2:02:05] that brother Brham is the seventh angel.
[2:02:11] The angel of the church of Lord this
[2:02:12] year
[2:02:14] is the seventh angel.
[2:02:17] Revelations 10:7.
[2:02:19] And God gives him all the mysteries.
[2:02:24] Let me say this. All the mysteries
[2:02:28] have been given to us by the angel.
[2:02:33] The prophet of Malachi.
[2:02:36] Now, brother
[2:02:39] was a prophet of God.
[2:02:43] And the prophet of God,
[2:02:45] him as the prophet of God,
[2:02:48] as a messenger of the church end,
[2:02:52] God vindicated his ministry.
[2:02:56] Not one year, not two years, but for
[2:03:00] many years
[2:03:02] from the first time he got the vision,
[2:03:06] when he was seven years,
[2:03:09] that vision came to pass. After the time
[2:03:12] was 56 years,
[2:03:15] he was seeing multit of vision.
[2:03:19] He got thousands of vision,
[2:03:24] thousands and tens of thousands
[2:03:28] all the time. The spirit of God would be
[2:03:30] showing,
[2:03:32] showing him this, showing him this. And
[2:03:35] they were coming to pass.
[2:03:38] Some of the things we can know
[2:03:41] that brother Brham prophesied before
[2:03:43] they came to pass.
[2:03:46] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:03:48] We can now turn to the timeline.
[2:03:52] Praise the name of our Lord. So we see
[2:03:56] that brother Brham was born on 6th of
[2:03:59] April 1909.
[2:04:05] And he was born
[2:04:07] Let us go to the chart I sent.
[2:04:14] Praise the name of our Lord. He was born
[2:04:16] in a cabin
[2:04:23] in a poor family
[2:04:27] in Kentucky in the USA.
[2:04:30] And when brother Brandham was born,
[2:04:34] the a strange light appeared.
[2:04:39] in the log cabin
[2:04:43] and it was hanging
[2:04:47] which is the pillar of fire. He was born
[2:04:51] as a prophet to the age.
[2:04:55] Praise the name of our lord. Then in
[2:04:57] 1916
[2:05:03] when he was going to when he was being
[2:05:06] sent by his parents,
[2:05:11] it was in a tree and he heard a voice.
[2:05:16] You know, there was a lot of wind that
[2:05:17] came.
[2:05:24] Then a voice told him, "Do not drink,
[2:05:29] do not smoke.
[2:05:32] Do not defile yourself in any way.
[2:05:35] There will be a work for you to do
[2:05:39] when you get older.
[2:05:43] When he was just seven years,
[2:05:48] remove those signs there. Now, I'll
[2:05:50] refer to them until you put
[2:05:54] now
[2:05:57] the voice told him, "Do not drink. Do
[2:06:02] not smoke. not defile yourself because
[2:06:05] there's a work you're going to do when
[2:06:06] you get older.
[2:06:09] And now brother as a human being
[2:06:14] he would always try to be influenced
[2:06:16] many times.
[2:06:19] There is a time
[2:06:21] you know he was with his father and the
[2:06:24] father was making alcohol
[2:06:29] and then the father was telling him
[2:06:32] I have my son here
[2:06:35] just a here
[2:06:38] he doesn't even drink
[2:06:41] then he was telling his friend you see
[2:06:44] my son one of the children I've got to
[2:06:49] Then they gave him a bottle to drink.
[2:06:52] When he was bringing the bottle to his
[2:06:54] mouth,
[2:06:56] that wind came on the noise.
[2:06:59] He threw down the bottle. He ran away.
[2:07:02] And then the father say, "You see the
[2:07:03] sister.
[2:07:08] Then another time
[2:07:10] he had a friend and then the friend was
[2:07:13] asking him, "Hey, what do you like? You
[2:07:17] don't want to go to dancing.
[2:07:19] You don't like drinking."
[2:07:21] And then the friend was smoking.
[2:07:24] Okay, you get this and also smoke.
[2:07:28] So when he was trying to get the
[2:07:29] cigarette,
[2:07:31] bring it closer to his mouth, that came
[2:07:34] back again.
[2:07:36] Then he took off.
[2:07:38] several times
[2:07:41] whenever he was trying to do things like
[2:07:43] a human being
[2:07:46] that noise would come all the way.
[2:07:50] Now when he was still seven years
[2:07:54] in 1916,
[2:07:57] he saw the first vision.
[2:08:00] And in that vision, he saw a bridge
[2:08:03] being constructed over a river Ohio
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:11] and he saw 16 people
[2:08:14] fell in the river and died.
[2:08:18] That was the first vision.
[2:08:20] After 22 years,
[2:08:24] that bridge was constructed on River
[2:08:26] Ohio,
[2:08:29] Ohio, which is called the Second Street
[2:08:31] Bridge in Losville.
[2:08:34] Second Streetville,
[2:08:37] it was built and 16 people died
[2:08:41] by falling into it.
[2:08:44] Then in 1923
[2:08:48] he saw the vision of hell.
[2:08:51] You know this came about you know he was
[2:08:54] a hunter. So when he went to hunting
[2:08:59] his friend accidentally shot his legs.
[2:09:05] So he was taken in hospital in a
[2:09:06] condition in a critical condition.
[2:09:10] And when he was in that condition,
[2:09:12] dying,
[2:09:14] he got himself into hell.
[2:09:18] And when he was in hell,
[2:09:22] bottomless pit,
[2:09:25] full of darkness
[2:09:27] and horror,
[2:09:29] he cried God for mercy.
[2:09:33] And he promised God that if we let him
[2:09:36] come back,
[2:09:38] he will leave a good boy.
[2:09:41] At that time, he was just about 14
[2:09:44] years. So, I'll be a good boy.
[2:09:49] He didn't know much about anything
[2:09:50] religion.
[2:09:52] They were not praying at his child.
[2:09:55] So when he came out of that vision
[2:09:58] condition
[2:10:01] when he came out of that condition
[2:10:04] because he had already collapsed
[2:10:06] he started just coming back and took
[2:10:08] time to fully recover
[2:10:12] and of course he didn't get back to God.
[2:10:18] So again one day
[2:10:22] he was working
[2:10:24] in New Albani Gas Works.
[2:10:27] New Albani Gas Works. New New Albani Gas
[2:10:30] Works. While he was repairing the
[2:10:32] meters,
[2:10:36] gas leaked poisoned him
[2:10:41] and he was hospitalized.
[2:10:44] The operation of appendix was done
[2:10:50] and he became weaker.
[2:10:53] Then again he got into another vision
[2:10:57] and the voice said
[2:10:59] don't drink don't smoke
[2:11:03] your body
[2:11:05] in any way I called you and you would do
[2:11:09] not go
[2:11:14] then he promised God that if you would
[2:11:17] go back to earth
[2:11:20] he would preach the gospel
[2:11:22] from the housetops to the street corners
[2:11:27] and after when he was dis because he
[2:11:30] after recovered.
[2:11:35] So he was discharged from hospital
[2:11:38] after that this time was serious.
[2:11:45] He gave his life to Jesus Christ as his
[2:11:48] Lord and personal savior
[2:11:51] and he was baptized in the water by
[2:11:53] immersion
[2:11:55] in the name of Jesus Christ. You know
[2:11:57] there are some people who want to be put
[2:12:00] in those situations
[2:12:04] when they accept Jesus Christ
[2:12:06] need to get into troubles.
[2:12:10] Some people are too busy for God.
[2:12:15] how sickness puts them
[2:12:18] on bed.
[2:12:19] Your beautiful office
[2:12:22] imagining it.
[2:12:25] Maybe your colleagues are saying
[2:12:31] they are saying that I'm the one who's
[2:12:32] going to take his position. I'm the one
[2:12:34] taking that. You know these places of
[2:12:35] work are very funny.
[2:12:39] They say when you become blind
[2:12:45] you can't do anything. When you become
[2:12:47] old you can't do anything.
[2:12:51] When you are incapacitated,
[2:12:55] bedridden,
[2:12:57] immediately they replace you
[2:13:00] and you find at the end of the day in
[2:13:03] whatever condition you are in, it's
[2:13:06] always your family that suffers with
[2:13:07] you.
[2:13:09] Your family learn not forget your
[2:13:12] family.
[2:13:14] Let work not make you forget your
[2:13:16] family.
[2:13:18] Let your achievement not make you
[2:13:19] forget.
[2:13:21] Let your friends not make you forget
[2:13:24] because they are with you
[2:13:27] even when everybody has rejected you.
[2:13:30] But more importantly
[2:13:33] in your good time. Have the Lord in your
[2:13:36] life
[2:13:37] because he will not leave you even in
[2:13:40] bad time. He's always there to help you.
[2:13:44] Praise the name of. So let us not love
[2:13:47] God when we're in troubles.
[2:13:51] Let us not come to for overnight
[2:13:54] when we have a lot of troubles.
[2:13:59] Want to marry
[2:14:01] overnight? I can't miss any overnight.
[2:14:03] Even when you marry come for the
[2:14:06] overnight
[2:14:07] [Music]
[2:14:11] even when you don't have troubles,
[2:14:14] come for praying and fasting.
[2:14:19] for me. I don't have anything to pray to
[2:14:20] God. The situation is just come. You are
[2:14:23] even a worse condition.
[2:14:28] When you say like that,
[2:14:30] I have nothing to pray to God. You are
[2:14:31] in a worse condition.
[2:14:34] Your troubles are too many
[2:14:37] because you are blind
[2:14:39] and you don't know it. And the Bible
[2:14:42] says blind,
[2:14:45] naked,
[2:14:48] miserable,
[2:14:50] poor,
[2:14:52] wretched.
[2:14:56] That's the condition of Licia
[2:14:58] because Ludicia
[2:15:00] was neither cold
[2:15:04] neither.
[2:15:05] Revelations chapter 3
[2:15:08] verse 14 to verse 22.
[2:15:12] And God was telling the church, at least
[2:15:14] if you were hot,
[2:15:17] I would have known how to help you.
[2:15:21] If you are cold, I would have known how
[2:15:24] to do if you are lukewarm,
[2:15:29] you are religious
[2:15:31] as well as Satanist.
[2:15:35] You know we see them
[2:15:39] you know like nowadays many which
[2:15:42] doctors have become pastors
[2:15:46] many of them and people just go to their
[2:15:49] churches for miracles
[2:15:52] to do funny funny things there
[2:15:55] look
[2:15:57] you can't preach to them Jesus they say
[2:15:59] we know him we preach him but their life
[2:16:03] is contrary to Jesus
[2:16:06] That's the condition of Lord.
[2:16:08] Blind,
[2:16:10] poor,
[2:16:12] wraed,
[2:16:14] naked,
[2:16:15] miserable,
[2:16:17] and they don't know it.
[2:16:19] But their testimony is we have need of
[2:16:22] nothing.
[2:16:26] I don't need to go to an overnight. I
[2:16:27] don't need to come for your prayer
[2:16:28] meeting.
[2:16:31] That's the church of this year.
[2:16:33] May God help us overcome that condition
[2:16:38] that we can always desire God.
[2:16:41] Whether you have everything,
[2:16:44] you are humble enough
[2:16:47] to recognize that whatever you have is
[2:16:51] the grace of God. It's only God who can
[2:16:54] protect what you have. So you depend
[2:16:57] upon him entirely.
[2:17:00] Like David was a king.
[2:17:03] But David the king said, I was happy
[2:17:06] when they said unto me,
[2:17:09] let us go into the house,
[2:17:11] David, a great king.
[2:17:14] And then he say I would rather be a
[2:17:17] domat in the house of God
[2:17:21] and stay in the king's palace.
[2:17:25] He was saying my palace
[2:17:28] a doat in the church
[2:17:31] a doat in a church
[2:17:33] better than his palace.
[2:17:36] And then for us
[2:17:39] I don't have time but you don't have a
[2:17:42] like David.
[2:17:45] But you can't humble yourself
[2:17:48] and sit in the presence of God.
[2:17:50] May God deliver us from that door.
[2:17:54] Praise the name of the Lord that you
[2:17:56] don't sit back at home
[2:17:58] when the church open.
[2:18:08] I cannot miss
[2:18:11] for the judge service.
[2:18:14] The film is sweeter.
[2:18:18] Ah, this newslet.
[2:18:36] Okay. How many minutes are left? Okay.
[2:18:38] Maybe let me go the last minute there.
[2:18:43] Hey,
[2:18:44] praise the name of We need to get back
[2:18:47] in line.
[2:18:49] Take advantage of all the church
[2:18:51] programs,
[2:18:54] our radio programs on Tuesday.
[2:18:57] Tuesday evening, listen to them. Friday
[2:19:01] evening,
[2:19:02] listen to them. Saturday morning, listen
[2:19:05] to them. Sunday morning, listen to them.
[2:19:09] our exaltations.
[2:19:11] Take time and listen to me.
[2:19:14] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:19:16] your heart is just thirsting for God.
[2:19:20] Praise the name of God. So when brother
[2:19:22] Brandham came out of that stretch,
[2:19:26] he accept the Lord Jesus as his personal
[2:19:28] savior
[2:19:30] in 1931.
[2:19:32] Then in 1932,
[2:19:35] he started the ministry.
[2:19:40] as a Baptist preacher.
[2:19:43] So in 1933,
[2:19:48] praise the name of our Lord in the month
[2:19:50] of June.
[2:19:53] He had seven major visions.
[2:20:01] It was a Sunday morning in June 1933.
[2:20:06] The Lord spoke to him and said
[2:20:11] that before the coming of the Lord
[2:20:15] or as it was drawing near,
[2:20:18] there are things that have to come to
[2:20:20] pass.
[2:20:23] Major events
[2:20:25] must come to pass. So he wrote them down
[2:20:31] as God gave him that revelation.
[2:20:34] There were visions,
[2:20:36] you know, one was coming after another.
[2:20:40] The first vision was
[2:20:42] he
[2:20:45] you can go and Google on Google maps and
[2:20:46] you'll find out these things as a fact.
[2:20:49] Google, Google and whatever you can find
[2:20:51] that information.
[2:20:54] In 1933
[2:20:57] in a vision he saw Molin
[2:21:01] invading Ethopia
[2:21:04] and that nation fell.
[2:21:07] He took over it.
[2:21:10] And so
[2:21:13] when invaded Ethopia
[2:21:17] because he used modern arms and took
[2:21:19] over that country
[2:21:24] and the natives of Ethopia would not
[2:21:26] overcome it.
[2:21:29] Afterwards
[2:21:32] came to a horrible end
[2:21:35] when people his own people in Italy
[2:21:38] turned against him.
[2:21:40] that came to pass
[2:21:43] as the vision say now brother's vision
[2:21:48] they were definite
[2:21:54] not guessing he would mention the name
[2:21:56] of the person
[2:21:59] not there will be somebody
[2:22:03] you know there is some televangelist
[2:22:07] TV who comes and raises his hand.
[2:22:12] You know, I've always wondered
[2:22:14] how many people fell by Jesus waving the
[2:22:17] hand.
[2:22:21] Is it in the scripture?
[2:22:23] The only person I saw or I read about
[2:22:28] who fell down was the other soldier who
[2:22:31] was coming to arrest Jesus
[2:22:34] when he fell back.
[2:22:36] But then here he swings the handing
[2:22:43] anointing anointing.
[2:22:45] Where is the scripture for that?
[2:22:50] Anyway,
[2:22:51] these people they stand before the
[2:22:54] people. They are there, there's somebody
[2:22:57] with the back there
[2:23:04] and you find there are 10 people
[2:23:08] Are you saying they
[2:23:12] call their name
[2:23:15] gamblers?
[2:23:19] Brother Brandham was not like that. He
[2:23:22] was definite.
[2:23:24] He would see a vision, calls you by
[2:23:27] name, even tells you where you come
[2:23:30] from.
[2:23:32] sometimes tells you what even happened
[2:23:33] at your home
[2:23:35] or what happened in hospital what the
[2:23:37] doctor was telling you
[2:23:40] by seeing vision.
[2:23:42] Praise the name of that is a prophet
[2:23:48] not
[2:23:50] next year
[2:23:52] Uganda is going to become rich
[2:23:55] because he saw the oil is going to start
[2:23:56] flowing next year.
[2:23:59] That's not a prophecy.
[2:24:02] A prophecy you prophesy
[2:24:05] is even when things are negative
[2:24:10] show that is going to happen
[2:24:13] as a prophet
[2:24:15] not past predictions
[2:24:18] like those people on stock exchange
[2:24:24] is past times tomorrow the shares are
[2:24:27] going to increaseh
[2:24:29] it's not good to
[2:24:31] Ah, next year they going to fall. Then
[2:24:34] he buys many. When after he has bought
[2:24:36] many, they increase, he sells, gets his
[2:24:40] money.
[2:24:42] That's not a prophet.
[2:24:45] Praise the name of. So he was definite.
[2:24:51] So that first vision
[2:24:54] came to pass.
[2:24:56] Then the second vision
[2:24:59] it was about the second world war
[2:25:06] that was in 1933
[2:25:09] June.
[2:25:10] A vision showed him
[2:25:13] the Australian
[2:25:16] Australia
[2:25:18] by the name of Adolf Hitler
[2:25:22] would rise up as a dictator and take
[2:25:25] over Germany
[2:25:28] and then he would draw the world into a
[2:25:31] world war.
[2:25:35] Seeing this in 1933,
[2:25:38] the second world war
[2:25:40] started in 1939
[2:25:44] by Hitler,
[2:25:47] brother in 1933.
[2:25:51] And then he talked about all that was
[2:25:53] happening.
[2:25:56] How many troops were killed in that war?
[2:26:01] Tens of millions of people.
[2:26:05] But finally,
[2:26:07] Hitler was overcome
[2:26:09] and the vision showed him that Hitler
[2:26:13] came to a mysterious end.
[2:26:17] Up to now, nobody knows how it died. But
[2:26:20] brother Brandham saw this in 1930
[2:26:25] and the Second World War was there from
[2:26:28] 1939.
[2:26:33] And still God showed him
[2:26:36] how the war stopped.
[2:26:38] It was God who stopped the war. It
[2:26:41] stopped at the same time.
[2:26:45] Praise the name of our Lord. We have got
[2:26:47] a prophet in
[2:26:50] prophesy.
[2:26:52] Tell others about it.
[2:26:55] We have a message of the hour.
[2:26:58] We don't have these prophets.
[2:27:01] Nobody says we have prophets
[2:27:03] who just want a title prophet.
[2:27:07] But when you ask him what did he
[2:27:08] prophesy
[2:27:11] and the other is a prophet
[2:27:17] and he begin selling heavenly places to
[2:27:20] people.
[2:27:22] Uganda's currenc doesn't work in heaven.
[2:27:26] Even the dollar doesn't work in heaven.
[2:27:29] Prophets, prophets,
[2:27:33] you buy in
[2:27:36] heaven know these fouses to sleep in.
[2:27:41] Praise the name of the Lord. So that was
[2:27:44] the second vision.
[2:27:47] Now in the third vision,
[2:27:51] the vision the the the vision showed him
[2:27:55] that the rim of world politics
[2:27:57] [Music]
[2:28:01] Because at that time
[2:28:04] there was fascism.
[2:28:06] Fascism was in Italy.
[2:28:10] There was Nazism
[2:28:12] that was in German. Then there was
[2:28:15] communism
[2:28:16] which was in Soviet Union.
[2:28:22] Soviet you know Russia was not as a
[2:28:25] country at that time.
[2:28:28] it was part of the big Ukraine and all
[2:28:31] those things around.
[2:28:35] So the current president of Russia,
[2:28:38] he wants to bring back all those
[2:28:40] countries that were part of Soviet Union
[2:28:44] and he's making sure
[2:28:46] because they made an agreement
[2:28:49] that the western world
[2:28:54] Europe
[2:28:57] and the US and Canada
[2:29:00] should not have any of military
[2:29:02] relations with former Soviet nation
[2:29:12] now getting there
[2:29:15] then the man is fighting back.
[2:29:17] So now he saw the vision
[2:29:21] that fascism and nazism will end up into
[2:29:26] communism.
[2:29:29] Right now even don't hear about them but
[2:29:31] communism is still there
[2:29:34] though not strong and then the voice
[2:29:36] said
[2:29:38] watch Russia.
[2:29:41] Russia was not a nation at that time.
[2:29:44] But now the spirit is looking at the end
[2:29:47] time.
[2:29:49] Watch Russia. Watch Russia.
[2:29:53] Keep your eye on the king of the north.
[2:29:58] That's what the voice was telling us.
[2:30:00] Watch Russia.
[2:30:02] Until right now, Russia is feared.
[2:30:05] Russia
[2:30:07] feared the last two years.
[2:30:11] They were threatening America,
[2:30:13] we are going to bomb you with nuclear
[2:30:15] missiles.
[2:30:17] And then they were showing America
[2:30:20] like a a mushroom.
[2:30:24] Then they were saying that the people in
[2:30:26] Mexico, they will see the USA as a
[2:30:29] mushroom burning.
[2:30:33] And they were telling them that we have
[2:30:36] nuclear bombs
[2:30:39] pointed on the cities of America.
[2:30:44] Brother was seeing these things
[2:30:47] many years ago. Now we see them coming
[2:30:50] to pass in our children.
[2:30:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[2:30:55] fourth vision
[2:30:58] he saw there was advances in science and
[2:31:02] technology
[2:31:05] after the Second World War
[2:31:08] until they made a vehicle
[2:31:12] which was like a plastic bubble.
[2:31:15] [Music]
[2:31:19] And that vehicle
[2:31:21] was running on beautiful highways
[2:31:25] under remote control.
[2:31:33] And people were seated there
[2:31:36] and they were just playing.
[2:31:45] Just playing.
[2:31:47] Just that.
[2:31:49] And the car is moving by itself
[2:31:52] under remote control.
[2:31:55] The thing has come to pass.
[2:31:58] But he saw it 1933.
[2:32:02] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[2:32:04] cars were like boxes,
[2:32:07] you say the shape is so funny.
[2:32:13] But now people want to buy beautiful
[2:32:16] cars.
[2:32:18] sleek cars.
[2:32:23] Now then he from that vision
[2:32:27] he saw the fifth vision
[2:32:30] and the fifth vision
[2:32:32] was about the moral problem of our age.
[2:32:36] [Music]
[2:32:42] And it was most it was showing women
[2:32:46] that women
[2:32:49] When they began to go out of their place
[2:32:53] and then they started getting into
[2:32:55] voting,
[2:32:57] then they started cutting off their
[2:32:59] hair,
[2:33:01] showing that they're no longer under the
[2:33:02] authority of man,
[2:33:06] insisted on equal rights
[2:33:11] or even more rights than men.
[2:33:14] They started putting on many's clothes
[2:33:19] and now started also going when they are
[2:33:21] not dressed
[2:33:24] until the last picture he saw.
[2:33:28] He saw a naked woman
[2:33:31] with a small fig leaf
[2:33:35] just in front of a private part.
[2:33:40] The vision saw the terrible perversion
[2:33:46] and the moral pride of the whole world.
[2:33:50] See why where we are living now.
[2:33:53] Somebody comes to the street
[2:33:56] with a night dress
[2:34:05] and they walking. You know how to turn
[2:34:07] your eyes off.
[2:34:09] They don't care.
[2:34:12] open back
[2:34:16] and then then there are those who get
[2:34:19] bras.
[2:34:21] [Music]
[2:34:24] There's a place I was in two years ago
[2:34:26] in somewhere in western Uganda
[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:32] and then there's a young man who came
[2:34:34] and was asking questions
[2:34:37] and then he was asking me
[2:34:42] Are men allowed to wear
[2:34:52] I asked him
[2:34:55] what are men going to
[2:34:58] [Laughter]
[2:35:02] now you can see the perversion
[2:35:06] men want to be like women
[2:35:08] want to be like
[2:35:11] So now they get those
[2:35:14] and they really push their breasts out
[2:35:18] and they out here and they want to
[2:35:21] breast everybody on the road
[2:35:30] out like this
[2:35:33] exposing their parts.
[2:35:38] The clothes cannot cover the body
[2:35:42] when they sit.
[2:35:44] It's another angle
[2:35:48] moral decay.
[2:35:50] And these are spirits that keep on
[2:35:52] upgrading.
[2:35:56] It It's something which is an evil
[2:35:59] spirit,
[2:36:01] spirits of adultery.
[2:36:04] And then they will cause you to come out
[2:36:05] of your home when you are you are just
[2:36:07] enticing people to look at you
[2:36:13] until on the day of judgment.
[2:36:15] A woman who dresses like that will have
[2:36:18] a line of men behind.
[2:36:22] How about these men?
[2:36:24] You committed adult oral fornication
[2:36:25] with them.
[2:36:27] Because the Bible says, "Whoever looks
[2:36:29] unto a woman and lusts after her has
[2:36:34] committed adultery."
[2:36:36] And then there are some sisters,
[2:36:39] they have special clothes for work.
[2:36:44] When they come to church, they also have
[2:36:46] special clothing.
[2:36:48] So if you want to know who they are,
[2:36:51] just go to their place.
[2:36:53] Is that sister so and so with a tight
[2:36:56] thing
[2:36:58] this way
[2:37:00] sleeveless
[2:37:06] you even to say you pray with
[2:37:11] sometimes even to tell them God bless
[2:37:13] you.
[2:37:15] Hey how are you?
[2:37:18] Some you call them. God bless you
[2:37:21] brother or sister.
[2:37:24] How are you?
[2:37:27] You can't testify of God at your place
[2:37:29] of God.
[2:37:32] And the Bible says if you are ashamed of
[2:37:34] me before men,
[2:37:38] it says also be ashamed before you
[2:37:41] before God and the holy.
[2:37:44] You know so the condition of mor is so
[2:37:46] bad
[2:37:48] until in those countries
[2:37:51] they have beaches
[2:37:53] where you go naked
[2:37:57] and you don't go with the phone.
[2:38:00] So you are not going to take anybody's
[2:38:02] photo.
[2:38:04] All of you are in Adam's suit.
[2:38:09] The man the woman
[2:38:12] that's your business.
[2:38:14] Many other days in some countries
[2:38:17] when they having rights for animals
[2:38:23] they go on the streets naked and walk
[2:38:27] no p no nicker no nothing
[2:38:33] others have a day to ride bicycles when
[2:38:35] they are naked
[2:38:40] then they are riding naked
[2:38:44] in those countries.
[2:38:47] And then sometimes
[2:38:49] of course we thank God that we are not
[2:38:51] do things are not here
[2:38:54] but then you may be there also
[2:39:01] by your phone
[2:39:06] but you are feeding on the things
[2:39:10] you are enjoying. You are testing them.
[2:39:16] You are feeding on those things.
[2:39:20] So you may not be there
[2:39:23] but you can be there television
[2:39:26] some funny movies late in the night
[2:39:34] in the night. You can even save the link
[2:39:39] or even if it is a smart TV,
[2:39:44] you put a lock on some of those things
[2:39:45] that children don't watch. What
[2:39:53] you are there now?
[2:39:57] So the moral decay
[2:40:00] that was the fifth vision thing has come
[2:40:02] to pass. All these visions
[2:40:06] Then the sixth vision.
[2:40:09] He says, "There arose up in America most
[2:40:12] beautiful
[2:40:16] but cruel woman.
[2:40:21] She held the people in her complete
[2:40:24] power."
[2:40:27] I believe that this was the rise of the
[2:40:29] Roman Catholic Church.
[2:40:33] Though I knew it, it could possibly be a
[2:40:35] vision of some woman rising in great
[2:40:37] power.
[2:40:41] In America due to a popular vote by
[2:40:44] women
[2:40:47] until now politically
[2:40:50] most of the ministers or secretaries in
[2:40:53] the the current administration in
[2:40:55] America,
[2:41:00] Catholic church.
[2:41:03] But then also brother would say that I
[2:41:06] saw a woman rise up
[2:41:11] vice president or president
[2:41:15] or president already had a woman vice
[2:41:17] president
[2:41:19] but he was talking these things when
[2:41:22] women were not voting
[2:41:25] they were not vying for position.
[2:41:29] And now you see the time that we are
[2:41:32] living in. So that vision
[2:41:35] fulfilled.
[2:41:37] Now God told him these seven visions
[2:41:40] have to come to pass before the end of
[2:41:43] the world
[2:41:50] already. Six
[2:41:54] fulfilled.
[2:41:56] What is remaining is the seventh one.
[2:42:00] And the seventh one, he says, "I heard a
[2:42:05] terrible explosion.
[2:42:09] And when I looked,
[2:42:11] I saw nothing but debris
[2:42:22] and smoke
[2:42:24] all over the land of America.
[2:42:30] Now that happens
[2:42:34] after the rapture
[2:42:37] because in America there's the bride of
[2:42:39] Jesus
[2:42:41] and the bride is taken before
[2:42:44] tribulation.
[2:42:46] So where are we?
[2:42:49] Praise the name of Russia. Russia has
[2:42:52] several times warned America.
[2:42:57] We see how the world is getting into
[2:43:00] battles everywhere.
[2:43:03] Here are your nuclear bombs. There are
[2:43:05] nuclear bombs.
[2:43:07] The world is in a total confusion.
[2:43:11] What time is it, sir?
[2:43:15] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:43:17] see that we trim our lamp.
[2:43:22] Have oil in your lamp.
[2:43:25] Praise the name of our God. You know the
[2:43:27] Bible says go to them that sell
[2:43:32] here at church. We have the oil. So when
[2:43:36] you come to the church, get the oil in
[2:43:38] your life.
[2:43:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Keep it
[2:43:42] burning.
[2:43:45] Praise the name of the Lord. So we need
[2:43:47] to see that we are serious with the
[2:43:50] message of the hour.
[2:43:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Go and tell
[2:43:57] people about the message.
[2:44:00] Have these things. Know them.
[2:44:04] Tell people this thing was prophesied.
[2:44:07] The things has already been talked
[2:44:08] about.
[2:44:10] Talk to them. Prophesy again.
[2:44:14] Praise the name of our God. Let us go to
[2:44:17] the next chart.
[2:44:23] This is not clear but I think we can use
[2:44:25] it.
[2:44:29] So in that same month of June 1933,
[2:44:37] Brother Brham was conducting a baptism
[2:44:39] of about 200 people
[2:44:44] in the presence of more than 1,000
[2:44:46] people
[2:44:49] on River Ohio
[2:44:52] at the foot of Spring Street.
[2:44:56] spring
[2:44:57] in Jaffersonville.
[2:45:00] While he was baptizing the 17th person,
[2:45:04] a bright a sign of a bright light came
[2:45:07] from heaven
[2:45:11] like a star and then descended
[2:45:16] where he was baptized.
[2:45:19] Now that's the picture which the
[2:45:21] newspapers took that day.
[2:45:25] And then they published it
[2:45:31] that a mysterious light
[2:45:36] appears upon a Baptist minister when
[2:45:38] baptizing people.
[2:45:41] Many people saw it
[2:45:44] until they took photo
[2:45:46] when he was baptizing.
[2:45:49] And then he says, "And then a voice
[2:45:53] came from that star which came down
[2:45:56] and saying as John the Baptist
[2:46:00] was sent to for the first coming of
[2:46:02] Jesus Christ,
[2:46:05] you are sent with the message
[2:46:08] to for
[2:46:09] the second coming of the Lord."
[2:46:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So brother
[2:46:14] Brana was sent with the message
[2:46:18] to forun
[2:46:20] the second coming of the Lord.
[2:46:24] So the message that we have
[2:46:26] prepares us for the second coming.
[2:46:30] Prepares us for the rapture.
[2:46:33] You must prophesy.
[2:46:35] Tell others about it.
[2:46:38] If you want to go to heaven, we have a
[2:46:40] message prepared for you.
[2:46:43] Tell others, talk to your friends, talk
[2:46:47] to your neighbors, your family, your
[2:46:50] colleagues, strangers.
[2:46:53] Tell it to the world.
[2:46:55] We must prophesy again.
[2:46:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[2:46:59] a message that prepares us for the
[2:47:03] rapture.
[2:47:05] Now on 7th May 1946
[2:47:13] 1946,
[2:47:16] brother Brham you know he would see many
[2:47:19] visions
[2:47:21] and then the religious people they would
[2:47:24] tell him no those visions are false
[2:47:27] those visions are false.
[2:47:29] They would discourage him until one day
[2:47:33] on 7th May 1946
[2:47:37] he sought to the Lord
[2:47:40] and then he said Lord take this thing
[2:47:42] away from me.
[2:47:44] I don't want to be different from other
[2:47:45] people. They tell me that what I see is
[2:47:48] wrong.
[2:47:50] But yet what he sees comes to pass. But
[2:47:54] the religious people are rejecting him
[2:47:56] because of what?
[2:47:58] And we see the problem also that Joseph
[2:48:00] had.
[2:48:03] Joseph was hated by his brethren
[2:48:06] because of his grace,
[2:48:09] because of his gift. And that's the same
[2:48:11] thing with the world. They have hated
[2:48:14] William Marion.
[2:48:16] They have hated the message of the hour
[2:48:19] because it is financial.
[2:48:22] So when you identify yourself with it,
[2:48:26] he want to isolate you. But that's the
[2:48:29] bitterness
[2:48:31] when you eat it.
[2:48:34] Sweet in the mouth.
[2:48:37] Oh, I thank God for this greatness, this
[2:48:39] great revelation. Then the bitterness
[2:48:42] comes,
[2:48:43] people isolating you, persecuting you,
[2:48:47] talking bad about you. Even Paul they
[2:48:50] talked bad about it.
[2:48:54] So you can't stand for the truth
[2:48:57] and everybody loves you.
[2:49:01] Everyone is going to love me with this
[2:49:02] isolate you.
[2:49:05] That's what Jesus said
[2:49:07] unto you.
[2:49:10] If men talk good about you
[2:49:14] because that's what they did. Because
[2:49:16] those who talked about prophets,
[2:49:20] they talked bad.
[2:49:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So we see
[2:49:26] we are living in a time
[2:49:30] whereby
[2:49:32] the rapture has to come to pass.
[2:49:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[2:49:39] speak that scripture
[2:49:42] in Luke chapter
[2:49:44] 6.
[2:49:51] Luke chapter 6
[2:49:55] verse 22
[2:49:58] he says, "Blessed are you when men shall
[2:50:02] hate you.
[2:50:08] Can you imagine blessing
[2:50:12] when they hating you
[2:50:17] wear
[2:50:19] and they hate you. The Bible says,
[2:50:22] "Blessed are you,
[2:50:32] but they begin calling you grand.
[2:50:35] Blessed are you,
[2:50:39] you have long hair,
[2:50:41] and then they demean it.
[2:50:45] Blessed are you."
[2:50:47] You don't want to go out hanging with
[2:50:49] boys or girls.
[2:50:52] Then they say
[2:50:55] this one is useless.
[2:50:57] Blessed are you. The Bible says blessed
[2:51:01] are you when men shall hate you
[2:51:06] and when they shall separate you from
[2:51:08] their company.
[2:51:13] Don't bring that one. Even when there is
[2:51:15] a committee,
[2:51:22] don't include him. He's a very bad man
[2:51:26] because he doesn't take bribes.
[2:51:31] When he sits in the committee of giving
[2:51:33] jobs, he wants truth.
[2:51:37] I can't work with that guy. He's crazy.
[2:51:40] That man is crazy.
[2:51:46] He says, "Blessed are you." Then he
[2:51:50] says, "And they shall reproach you
[2:51:53] and cast you out.
[2:52:02] Cast out your name as evil
[2:52:07] for the son of man's sake.
[2:52:14] You have taken the message of the hour
[2:52:17] which is the message of God.
[2:52:20] So they cast you out. Have nothing to do
[2:52:23] with that guy. I don't want that guy to
[2:52:26] come.
[2:52:28] He says blessed are you. Then he says
[2:52:32] rejoice ye in that day
[2:52:37] and live for joy.
[2:52:40] For behold,
[2:52:42] your reward is great in heaven.
[2:52:47] For in the like manner
[2:52:50] they did did their fathers unto the
[2:52:53] prophets.
[2:52:58] That's what they do. Then he goes again
[2:53:02] in verse 26
[2:53:04] and he says, "Woe unto you
[2:53:08] when all men shall speak well of you
[2:53:15] [Music]
[2:53:23] because you allow homosexuals.
[2:53:29] for you don't see. Amen.
[2:53:33] Women preachers also of God.
[2:53:39] When men speak well of you,
[2:53:43] then he says,
[2:53:45] for they did their fathers to the false
[2:53:47] prophets.
[2:53:53] So false prophet doesn't care.
[2:54:00] Ah, you're going to win
[2:54:04] with the horns. You're going to take
[2:54:05] over.
[2:54:08] That's how he was prophesying before
[2:54:11] because he wanted to sit on the table of
[2:54:18] chicken.
[2:54:27] Amen.
[2:54:34] False prophets.
[2:54:37] And then you also want to take the same
[2:54:38] place of false prophet
[2:54:42] war unto you
[2:54:45] because many times people don't want the
[2:54:48] truth and when you do the truth they
[2:54:51] will hate you for the truth.
[2:54:54] I don't like him. That was
[2:54:59] you know you know king Jehoshaphat
[2:55:03] told
[2:55:06] Hey, let us pass in to the lord before
[2:55:08] we go to
[2:55:13] you know and then he said I don't like
[2:55:16] that man. You will go and read in first
[2:55:18] kings chapter 21 you'll see that story
[2:55:24] then called his prophets 400 prophets
[2:55:29] and then when he started asking them
[2:55:32] praise the name over there you can pick
[2:55:34] that that story there.
[2:55:37] They want to speak good even when it is
[2:55:40] evil.
[2:55:43] In first kings chapter 22
[2:55:48] and then verse two.
[2:55:54] Okay start from verse 4 to save time.
[2:55:57] And he said unto Jehoshaphat that was a
[2:56:00] will you go with me to battle in Ramoth
[2:56:02] Gilead? And yphart said to the king of
[2:56:04] Israel, "I am as though and my people
[2:56:07] are thine. My horses are thy horses.
[2:56:37] And Joseph said unto the king of Israel,
[2:56:39] "Inquire, I pray thee at the word of the
[2:56:42] Lord today.
[2:56:51] And the king of Israel gathered the
[2:56:53] prophets together about 400 men and said
[2:56:56] unto them, "Shall I go with Gileia to
[2:56:58] battle or shall I forbear?" And they
[2:57:00] said, "Go up. The Lord shall deliver it
[2:57:03] into the hand of the king.
[2:57:14] So
[2:57:17] nic
[2:57:35] 400 prophets
[2:57:37] prophesying good
[2:57:40] for a man God has cast
[2:57:43] me
[2:57:52] meals. As long as he sees here, he can
[2:57:54] get some money,
[2:57:57] he passes here.
[2:57:59] You know, God God cares, don't
[2:58:03] false prophets. So everybody talks about
[2:58:06] them.
[2:58:09] Everybody
[2:58:11] that man is good. He knows you go to the
[2:58:14] bar
[2:58:15] but doesn't I don't mind that's a
[2:58:17] business. So you know you have to
[2:58:18] survive. No don't worry
[2:58:23] false prophets
[2:58:25] speaking well. That's what I have heard
[2:58:28] 400 prophets
[2:58:31] and the king said no.
[2:58:34] Y said unto the king of Israel, inquire
[2:58:37] I pray thee at the word of the Lord
[2:58:40] today.
[2:58:42] Okay, that was in verse seven. And Yu
[2:58:44] said, is there not a prophet of the Lord
[2:58:47] besides this that we might inquire of
[2:58:49] him? So there's something wrong there.
[2:58:55] After
[2:58:59] having 400 men,
[2:59:03] why do you want another one? He had a
[2:59:06] spiritual eye.
[2:59:08] And then I have told him there is one
[2:59:14] but I hate him.
[2:59:18] I said why? He speaks bad about me.
[2:59:24] So the Bible say unto you
[2:59:28] if all men shall speak about it
[2:59:31] because that's what they spoke about
[2:59:33] false prophets.
[2:59:35] So Ahab was talking good about false
[2:59:37] prophets.
[2:59:39] But when come the true prophet I hate
[2:59:42] him.
[2:59:45] So that's what happens.
[2:59:48] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:59:51] So let us now in the on the 7th of May
[2:59:56] 1946,
[2:59:59] brother Brham went and waited on the
[3:00:01] Lord.
[3:00:04] So in the night
[3:00:06] when he was where he was in the cave
[3:00:10] now I'm not telling you to go to the
[3:00:11] caves
[3:00:13] you know brother also went to the cave I
[3:00:15] need to go to the cave
[3:00:17] brother used to go to the mountain
[3:00:21] that's not what I'm telling you praise
[3:00:24] the name of so he says an angel appeared
[3:00:27] to him
[3:00:30] and said
[3:00:32] Do not fear.
[3:00:34] I think we can you can get to those
[3:00:36] slides.
[3:00:39] I am sent from the presence of almighty
[3:00:41] God
[3:00:43] to tell you that your puria birth
[3:00:48] and misunderstood life
[3:00:51] has been to indicate that you are to
[3:00:53] take a gift of divine healing to the
[3:00:55] people of the world.
[3:01:00] If you will be sincere
[3:01:03] when you pray and get the people to
[3:01:06] believe you,
[3:01:09] nothing shall stand before your prayer,
[3:01:14] even cancer.
[3:01:16] You will go into many parts of the earth
[3:01:19] and will pray for the kings
[3:01:22] and rulers and potent.
[3:01:27] You will preach to multitudes the world
[3:01:30] all over
[3:01:38] and thousands will come to for counel to
[3:01:40] you.
[3:01:44] You must tell them. Now this is where we
[3:01:47] need to note.
[3:01:48] You must tell them that their thoughts
[3:01:54] speak louder in heaven than their words.
[3:01:57] [Music]
[3:02:01] Be conscious
[3:02:03] your thoughts.
[3:02:05] Evil thoughts about a brother, evil
[3:02:08] thoughts about a sister, they're always
[3:02:10] loud. Boom.
[3:02:13] Then the angels can wonder. Even this
[3:02:15] one speaks thinks like that.
[3:02:20] What are you thinking? All wrong
[3:02:22] thoughts about your wife or your
[3:02:24] husband.
[3:02:27] your wife, you think like that,
[3:02:32] your husband, you think like that,
[3:02:35] your parents, you're thinking like that.
[3:02:38] So he says, "Wrong thoughts. Speak
[3:02:41] louder in heaven
[3:02:44] than our words." Then the angel told him
[3:02:48] as the prophet Moses was given two signs
[3:02:52] to prove he was sent from God.
[3:02:55] You will be given two signs.
[3:02:58] The first sign when you take the
[3:03:00] person's right hand
[3:03:04] into your right left hand
[3:03:07] you'll be able to detect the presence of
[3:03:09] any germ caused disease
[3:03:15] by vibrations that will appear in your
[3:03:17] left hand.
[3:03:20] Then you must pray for the person.
[3:03:23] If your hand returns to normal,
[3:03:26] you can pronounce them healed.
[3:03:29] If it doesn't,
[3:03:31] just ask a blessing and walk away
[3:03:36] under the anointing from God.
[3:03:39] Do not try to think your own thoughts.
[3:03:45] It will be
[3:03:47] given to you what to say.
[3:03:52] The second sign is greater than the
[3:03:55] first.
[3:03:57] If you will stay humble and sincere,
[3:04:01] it will come to pass
[3:04:04] that you'll be able to tell by vision,
[3:04:08] the very secrets of their hearts.
[3:04:11] Then the people will have to believe
[3:04:13] you.
[3:04:15] This will initiate the gospel
[3:04:18] in the power that will bring the second
[3:04:21] coming of Jesus.
[3:04:25] Praise the name of our Lord.
[3:04:28] I hope you attentive
[3:04:31] break.
[3:04:33] Praise the name of Lord. You know there
[3:04:35] are so many things here. I just want to
[3:04:38] hear them.
[3:04:41] So the first sign appeared immediately
[3:04:44] in that same month of May 1946.
[3:04:50] Praise the name of our Lord. It appeared
[3:04:52] immediately.
[3:04:54] And so he would touch the person's hand
[3:04:59] his right hand into his left hand. Then
[3:05:03] his hand would start vibrating,
[3:05:05] showing different colors and waves of
[3:05:08] vibration.
[3:05:10] So he would know
[3:05:12] you having tuberculosis,
[3:05:16] you having this then he prays for the
[3:05:18] person when the hand stops vibrating
[3:05:22] tell them you are healed.
[3:05:25] That happened immediately.
[3:05:27] Praise the name of God. Now the second
[3:05:30] sign
[3:05:31] it started it happened in July 1946
[3:05:39] when he was preaching in reg
[3:05:41] Saskatchewan in Canada
[3:05:45] in the crowd of 10,000 people.
[3:05:50] He started seeing visions.
[3:05:53] Then he was wondering what is this?
[3:05:55] And then he started telling people what
[3:05:59] their lives were
[3:06:02] and then he would declare them healed
[3:06:06] that happened. Now the first sign
[3:06:10] when the Pentecostals saw it
[3:06:14] they started also imitating this.
[3:06:16] Oh water coming from my hand, blood
[3:06:18] coming from my hand.
[3:06:21] They went and do a lot of things cont
[3:06:26] because they were crueling crowds.
[3:06:29] Even when they start seeing the second
[3:06:30] son,
[3:06:32] they started imitating it. They there
[3:06:34] there.
[3:06:36] And nowadays what they do, they prepare
[3:06:39] people
[3:06:41] and tell them
[3:06:43] you come and say you were healed of
[3:06:45] this.
[3:06:47] when they on the radio, you call and say
[3:06:50] the other time when you prayed, they did
[3:06:52] this and this.
[3:06:55] They buy witnesses.
[3:06:58] Now, unfortunately,
[3:07:03] when they buy them, they don't pay them.
[3:07:07] Then they come out and tell them
[3:07:10] I was in the other church there. We used
[3:07:11] to do this. Other church used to do
[3:07:13] this. Then some people just come and
[3:07:16] pretend that they are blind or
[3:07:21] then when they pray for them
[3:07:26] imitations
[3:07:28] that's what is happening there
[3:07:31] not genuine things
[3:07:35] but thank God you had a voice in our
[3:07:37] generation
[3:07:39] praise the name of take time and hear
[3:07:41] those steps
[3:07:44] and you see that voice
[3:07:46] speaking from the spiritual
[3:07:49] speaking it out and coming to pass.
[3:07:53] Testify about this thing. Praise the
[3:07:56] name of our Lord. You must prophesy
[3:07:58] again.
[3:08:01] Talk to others about the things.
[3:08:05] Tell it to the world.
[3:08:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, I just
[3:08:10] want to stop on this.
[3:08:12] We shall have another service sometime
[3:08:13] later
[3:08:16] when we are talking about the revelation
[3:08:18] of the son of man
[3:08:21] and then I'll finish up this because you
[3:08:24] can imagine I'm on page four
[3:08:28] and me to go up to page seven.
[3:08:32] So if we continue
[3:08:35] here
[3:08:37] praise the name of so you must prophesy
[3:08:42] We have the message.
[3:08:44] Take it serious in your life.
[3:08:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Testify
[3:08:49] about it.
[3:08:51] Thank God for what the message has given
[3:08:53] unto us.
[3:08:55] Listen to it. Read the books. Share with
[3:08:59] others the Lord has done what the Lord
[3:09:02] has given unto us. Praise the name of
[3:09:05] our Lord. And then you'll see the elect
[3:09:09] will love the message.
[3:09:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Like just a
[3:09:13] short testimony before we close.
[3:09:16] There is a sister.
[3:09:18] She was working in Ethopia.
[3:09:22] And so now she was praying in a certain
[3:09:24] church in Kala
[3:09:26] where she was subscribing as a member of
[3:09:29] that church
[3:09:31] member.
[3:09:33] So she would listen to the messages or
[3:09:35] sermons on online.
[3:09:39] So her pastor said
[3:09:43] William Brham
[3:09:45] was not a man of God.
[3:09:48] So that thing she said ah who is this
[3:09:50] William
[3:09:53] who was doing this and they saying he's
[3:09:54] not a man of God.
[3:09:57] She went on internet
[3:09:59] started reading about brother Brana.
[3:10:03] and said then she went to where the
[3:10:06] messages were coming from
[3:10:09] to find out
[3:10:12] what is this
[3:10:14] one has talked bad about it
[3:10:17] but then I'm seeing this and this of
[3:10:19] course she went into prayer
[3:10:22] so when she got information
[3:10:26] with further reading and praying she was
[3:10:30] convicted
[3:10:31] This was the truth and then she started
[3:10:34] asking
[3:10:36] where is this church
[3:10:39] in the country. So she asked from the
[3:10:42] USA and then the director where the
[3:10:44] church was.
[3:10:47] That's how she came out.
[3:10:50] So don't be shy to talk about what God
[3:10:52] has given us.
[3:10:56] Sometimes they may talk bad
[3:10:58] but can pick it up. I want to find out
[3:11:03] praise the name over and that's what
[3:11:04] pastor says
[3:11:07] concerning brother
[3:11:09] he was praying in across
[3:11:13] and then now they were telling those
[3:11:15] people are fallen but they love God
[3:11:18] then he came you know to try to correct
[3:11:23] these people should not perish
[3:11:27] and many people have come out like that
[3:11:30] so when they come with their few
[3:11:31] scriptures
[3:11:33] when they meet you said
[3:11:40] when you go to godhead
[3:11:44] you mean there is not trinity
[3:11:47] when you go to baptism you mean I'm not
[3:11:50] yet saved
[3:11:51] yes your sins are there because your
[3:11:55] sins are there because you have not been
[3:11:57] buried in the name of Jesus and they
[3:11:59] keep on coming out. Many of them in the
[3:12:02] missionaries we do around the country,
[3:12:05] they are coming out.
[3:12:08] You can also do the same thing.
[3:12:11] You must prophesy again.
[3:12:14] Praise the name of our Lord. To many
[3:12:16] people,
[3:12:18] tell them praise the name of go and tell
[3:12:22] it to the m
[3:12:25] Christ is risen.
[3:12:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Christ is
[3:12:30] alive. The message of the hour brings us
[3:12:34] Christ.
[3:12:36] God himself
[3:12:38] coming down in our lives. Praise the
[3:12:40] name of our Lord. Tell it to the
[3:12:42] mountain.
[3:12:44] I don't know if we can have that song.
[3:12:47] Tell it to the mountain. I don't know.
[3:12:48] Do you have
[3:12:52] if you can put it there and we sing it?
[3:12:55] We go and make it clear
[3:12:58] right now. People in campaigns
[3:13:02] and they have
[3:13:05] they have whistles.
[3:13:07] They drumming support for their
[3:13:09] candidates.
[3:13:12] Today we have our Lord Jesus Christ.
