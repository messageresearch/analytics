you may be seated I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you all welcome for this service sorry a number of people are late the rains are raining almost around many places sometimes inconveniences people's movement do we have somebody coming here for the first time we recognize you just by raising your hand I believe none of us is a stranger you all welcome Pastor today to that's why he's going to preach the day so just keep him in your prayers praise the name of the Lord so we want to appreciate Pastor coming here he has come with some people who want to be baptized today we have only one service immedately after the service I think the baptism will happen then even next Sunday is first of December we shall also have only one service but then on 8th of December those are the week after this the coming weekend we shall have brother Andrea ring coming to minister for two services praise the name of the Lord so we keep praying for those meetings and I would like always call upon your support praise the name of the Lord we don't have a culture of coming every Sunday asking you for money but you know that money is spent praise the name of our Lord when we have these meetings is spent and when we invite people we want to have a meal together so you put it in upon yourself that if you are not given F won't you eat praise the name of so what you are meant to spend why don't you put it together with brother Peter always does that and we always appreciate the people always contribute praise the name of our but let us all partake of that blessing let us all partake of those blessings you know when we learn to support the things of the Kingdom you are investing some things eternally praise the name of our you know when you have maybe a party or an ounting you can even afford to eat a meal of 50,000 how about when you know that children of God are coming and then you say let me put this to feed others I believe there is a greater blessing for that so let us try to do as much as we can this month of November has been very costly even December is going to be very costly January is going to be very costly praise the name of our Lord in January let me say for example we are going to be hosting brother Steven do on 50th of January a son of brother was here recently but then after two weeks from but then again on 19th we shall be hosting another brother from other brothers from the USA and when they come there's a lot of movement involved so we really call upon your support praise the name of our Lord when we announc that maybe we having meetings around let it be in your mind that they spending let it be in your heart I want to be blessed praise the name of I give then I am blessed praise the name of like maybe recently brother when we had brother team here he came to me with an envelope and then he said this is lunch for the V and it was such a blessing to him praise the name of you know that kind of really taking responsibility like many times like when these Breen come Pastor them at his home praise the name of and one day I think he sent me to buy vegetables you know just vegetables from the market to take care of the visitors at home but only just buy that was over 13,000 spinach this one even some vegetables I didn't know about but trying to make them comfortable at home so it cost a lot and we would call you to always be mindful to help carry that burden because when the visitors come they come to bless all of us praise the name of the Lord I wish to call you on to do that praise the name of the Lord I don't know if there is a song this morning praise the name of the Lord per there is not let us turn to our Bibles we are going to read from the book of Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians 1se so the scripture says blessed be the God and the father of all Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us acceptable in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure where which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on Earth us even in him let us pray father we thank you for the word that we have and Lord you know the meaning beneath these scriptures and you can make known to us father purpose father for us we pray you may make yourself known unto us and speak to us in such a special that may be fully be established in you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you may be seated I want to preach about the purpose of his will the purpose of his will praise the name of our Lord you know God does not do anything without a purpose whether it looks bad or whether it looks good everything that God does has got a purpose and that purpose is done according to his will praise the name of our Lord even where we are born the parents that God made us come from God predetermined you know he decided that he should be like the time of your birth the place of your how you look like the community you're going to live with the friends you're going to interact the things you're going to like things you're going to detest you know you know the things you're going to dislike you know God purpose praise the name of our Lord and then he created People based on his purpose and you know what he wanted praise the name of our Lord and as brother Bram teaches us that God is God of a Varity praise the name of our Lord you know like here you can see that we don't have those many Hills but now when you go to a place like when you enter place like you know there are Hills when you go to a place around Masa when now you go further west there are so many Hills you know but then here you find that you have only one praise the name of the Lord and then now when you go to places like then you go that side kja then you you find lands which are plain you can see a far is a god of Varity praise the name of our Lord now as you can see now those mountains in K and other places and then maybe you go to a place like then you get a big mountain is God of you know then when you look at the trees then you get a big tree like a tree but then you can also get small trees short trees and different things and how the Lord has created is that in every place there are special species that survive in that place like now when you go to some of these places dry places you'll find that they also have fruits particular fruits which cannot survive in our places like we are here and then there you find that those people live by those fruits and then there are also animals in those places which can take days without drinking any water and they surviving so God has made things differently and then the Bible tells us that he has created us when we go to the Book of Revelation praise the name of the Lord in Revelations 4 and then verse 11 the Bible says though worthy oh Lord receive glory and honor and power for th has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created praise the name of our Lord so now the Bible says here that God has created all things for his pleasure praise the name of the Lord for his purpose for his will and then the Bible says that those things he has created they are and they were in other words whatever he has created he sustains it whatever he has created he enables it to continue according to his purpose praise the name of our Lord according to the purpose of God so it continues praise the name of our Lord you know like when you look at the people are on earth and then you look at the different countries praise the name of our you see people look different the way they are shaped the way their colors [Music] are even the food they eat the way they dress the way their hair is for you it may be offensive praise the name of you look at somebody you don't like the way they dress you don't like the way they look even what they eat I can't eat that but God has made them praise the name of the Lord when you look like in South America South America they are totally different from North America praise the name of our then you come to Africa totally different from Europe and then when you go to Asia you look at the Indians and then you look at the Koreans then you look at the Japanese then you look at the Chinese totally different praise the name of Lord totally different and now like you know they we used to get toys for children you know these dolls now when you look at it you say this is real toy but there are people who are like those toys exactly those you look I used to see but now for you see you don't see any person like that but then there are people who are like that and even the way they will eat the way they will walk you find that I can't survive here so now the Bible has told us God has made everything for his pleasure praise the name of our Lord like now when you go to Asia the way they dress they vary from country to Country you look at the Arabs the way they dress long things and then those from sa Arabia put on something on the head like this now when you go to Pakistan they are different they put on something like a dress and then something like a TR you look at the Iranians totally different even what they eat and some of their countries are Sunday countries but God has given them Grace To Survive there they have different temperaments either they can become too annoyed very [Music] fast but God is pleased that they like that and in that kind of so the Bible has told us he has created all things for his pleasure they are and they were it's God who maintains them praise the name of our Lord now in The Message Church H he says he is a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed the plan of the Salvation of his own elect which he for knew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will praise the name of our Lord so then brother Bram is saying that the holy spirit executes all the will of the father and is working in all things at this moment according to the purpose of his Own Way praise the name of our so now God is working upon us to fulfill his purpose that we can do what he has ordained for us to do now each and every one of us individually praise the name of our Lord you need to seek the will of God for your life has God so made me what is God's purpose for my life praise the name of our Lord you need to find out from God what is the purpose of God for my life you know we are not just live on us grow up get a good profession get a good job get a family raise the children after raising the children see your grandchildren say now I can depart in peace it's different from us now the rest of the people can think about that but that is temporary but yet there is an eternal purpose for every one of us why God has created us why God has made us praise the name of our Lord and so the Bible brother Bram tells us each and every one of us should seek the will of God in the message adoption chap he says having made known to us the mystery of his way the mysteries of his will and remember how we hung on that how many was here this morning then he says the mystery of his word now it is not just a little thing then it's a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for is or herself God is Mystery can every one of us you need to know Lord you've made me Lord you've made me to come in this generation what the purpose that have come in this generation praise the name of our Lord why have I come at this time why am I here there is a purpose of God is the name of our Lord like I can give a little example I have many of my friends Almost ages praise the name of our Lord and then some of them they ask you which class is your first born then you tell them Senor hey what happened then you ask them what about yours is almost finishing University start wondering praise the name of then you start wondering where the D is why did they take a long time but there's a purpose of God praise the name of our Lord and then I just got consolation sometime and then I just realized it was my time to raise children in this generation to prove to the world that they can be Christians praise the name of our Lord so we have to know what's the will of God for our lives look what the life of Han praise the name of Han had AWI and then the cowi was giving birth the children were growing up but was baren until the started you know putting pressure on her why don't you produce you you just here doing this and then Ka developed a burden and went to the temple and started crying to God Lord have upon Lord look at my reproach and then she prayed desperately until God had a prayer she conceived and gave birth now in her prayer she desperately prayed and promised God I am going to give this child back to you and I believe that's what God was looking from her all that time because if she was giving like the other one she don't mind giving the child to God but now God made sure that she's in a fix she can't do anything until she said I'm giving you this child and now when Samuel was win you know you know at stop bre feeding she brought Samuel to the temple and now God had already ordained Samuel to be a prophet to be a judge over Israel but how could that be God had to allow strations until Han gets into the mind of God that the child I'm going to give birth to is not my child but he the child of God praise the name of our Lord and also God wants us to reach that condition that now this I'm not on my own praise the name of our Lord and each of us should come to that realization that I'm not living my own life I'm not seeking my own desire but I'm seeking the will of God I'm seeking the purpose of God praise name of our Lord and then you can see how the Lord can come and handle things so each and every one of us has to seek the will of God for our lives praise the name of our Lord then say how did we how do we find out the will of God for our lives Paul it was known to him he said did not Comer with any man no fresh and blood he went to no school no Seminary he had nothing to do with it he received it it was revealed to him by Jesus Christ who met him on the road to Damascus like a pillar of fire and called him and he went to Arabia and there he dwelt three years don't you imagine that was some time years was down there in Arabia he rented his little building somewhere walking up and down the floor with all the old Scrolls praise the name of our Lord now we are seeing how we can find God's purpose for our life each and every one of us take time and wait on the Lord take time and seek God and then you find out from God Lord why have you made me this why have you put me in this place praise the name of our Lord why have you put me in this kind of area why am I doing this kind of job because there is a purpose of God for that so even Paul S the purpose of God for by going back to read the scriptures how that God at the beginning predestinated us unto eternal life how that he would send Jesus that through this sacrifice all have a right to the Tree of Life does he for you he called does he called he has already Justified does he justified he has already glorified God since the beginning of the world predestinated us to the adoption of sons now the whole creation groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God I would imagine Paul had a wonderful time I would like to have been there with him don't you praise the name of Lord so he went and S God and you know Paul was at a crossroad you know the way he was raised a Pharisee somebody who knew the Lord somebody was a scholar and then he persecuted the church and then the grace of God Christ appeared to him praise the name of the Lord when he was going to Damascus and then he was wondering what is this Lord for three days he was praying and fasting praise the name of then after his conversion he went to Arabia for 3 years to really go back and read the things he had been taught in school get the true understanding of what God wants to speak to praise the name of our and each and every one of us by the grace of God he has given us the message of the hour take time hear that message praise the name of the Lord time seek the will of God take time read the scriptures and then in them God will give you an understanding of things pertaining to your life praise the name of our Lord when brother Bram was wondering Lord why have you sent me for and then the Lord showed him praise the name of our Lord he showed him Genesis 2 praise the name of our Lord and then he read that story of Abraham ISAC and and Rebecca and it was revealed to him that it is he is doing the work of el to bring the bride of Christ to Jesus Christ how about us praise the name of our Lord find out the purpose of God for your way at your place of work are you there only to earn money and you're working how to get a promotion it's not only that God has put you there as a witness praise the name of our Lord because at the end of the day there's going to be a judgment now who will judge the people you work with you are the one going to stand there to judge praise the name of Lord God has put there as a witness while they do things which are not right God shows them that what you are doing right and so you stand there as a witness where you are living your home God has put there as a witness praise the name of our Lord at the school where you're going God has put there as a witness praise the name of our Lord that you can give a testimony that however evil this place of work is however evil the community I'm living in is yet I can live upright before God praise the name of our Lord so you seek the will of God and say Lord give me the grace praise the name of our Lord that I may be able to serve you Faithfully in the place that I'm living in praise the name of our Lord let us go to the book of Ephesians and then chter 1 and verse 17 praise the name of our Lord the scripture says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him so you pray to God Lord give me the spirit of wisdom praise the name of our Lord to handle the challenges that I'm facing in life give me the spirit of wisdom the spirit of understand the Revelation to know the will of God in what I'm going praise the name of our Lord the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints praise the name of our Lord so you pray to God lord here I am you have called me guide me direct me praise the name of our Lord like maybe sometimes you've gone to the college you know maybe doing a professional job training and then you know in some of these places you're not going to choose the people you're going to sleep with you find that sometimes they fixed with somebody you don't know about completely you don't you have not you don't choose the people you're going to study with you don't choose them even the people are going to lecture to you but all this God has already done it praise the name of our Lord because there is a purpose somewhere and so you get there you all strangers and sometimes like maybe you apply to go to this University or college I want to do this kind of course but finally you find that the course is different you're doing you're doing from a different University the people you're going to interact with God purposes everything praise the name of our Lord it was not in Jacob's mind that he will end up running to lean's place it wasn't at all praise the name of our Lord the mother just told Jacob the mother your father has told your brother go make for me a meal now my Sony my voice get a l bring it dress it I cook for your father then you go and give to your father he eats and He blesses you Jacob said no no no no how about if discovered then Rebecca told him it will be upon me only obey me now Rebecca had the mind of God that the younger shall rule the Elder the Elder Shall Serve the young is Isaac was a prophet but God didn't reveal that to him at that time but he revealed to Rebecca and you know Isaac lived more years than Abraham praise the name of our Lord but most of his life he was blind praise the name of and God had to make sure that he's blind and he does see any vision and He blesses Jacob yet he wanted to bless Isaac so it was the purpose of God to see that things would be like that there's some things that come to our lives and you don't know why it is happening but there's a purpose of God at the end of the day praise the name of our Lord and said Lord show me your will show me your direction here praise the name of and now when at the end of the day praise the name of when Isaac had blessed Jacob then es comes too late and then the father trembled he trembled but it was already gone praise the name of our Lord and then God when es was having it in his heart to kill Jacob after the death of Isaac God revealed Toc he showed her that once K Jacob then now Rebecca tells Isaac Isaac you know my son if he marries from this canit like has done it will not be good but yet she knew that this one wants to kill the other and then tells Jacob go to my brother's place and then you find that it is at the brother's place in leban is place that Jacob was able to Bear 12 children to build a tribe of Israel praise the name of our Lord but even what he went through it was not his making praise the name of our Lord you know when he he goes there he has worked for leban then tells him why would you work for me for free you my relative you should get a wage then he says Ah let me work to get Rachel and himself determined he decided let me work for you seven years and then I get I said it's okay I give you when the seven years were over he called for a function the people of the to come he's giving his daughter in marriage praise the name of our Lord you know I have brother then when you talk to them say I have a wife I have a child then I asked them who gave you that wife did you get on the road because wives are given the parents give their children into marriage but now for you you get somebody at school you just take at home you mean it's the school that raised her you get somebody at a place of work it's my colleague you also just take raised you get somebody in the road you mean it's the road which rais that person you have to go and ask that person in marriage praise the name of our Lord Jacob didn't take off with the Rachel he waited even when lean gave him praise the name of our Lord you know lean had a Doctrine that you know the younger should not marry before the Elder and you know there some families I don't want to marry before my brother or my sister it also Spain so he gave him lay and then God made lay not produce used for seven years and then you know he said you if you want Rachel work for her when the seven years were over he gave her Rachel even Rachel was baren and then God saw that he hated Le he opened the womb of Le she gave birth and so when you follow that story you find there are so many things that were ordained of the lot praise the name of our Lord and even in our lives we need to seek the will of God lord distraction has come maybe at your place of work you have lost the job you shouldn't lose hope there is a purpose of God for that just say Lord as this door has closed where is the door which has opened praise the name of our Lord when you are disappointed here you don't give up and send me everything is over say Lord this has come to an end guide me the next step praise the name over and then you'll find that you live a life of contentment you will live a life of contentment always thankful to God knowing that God is in control over every Str whatever Junction of time you get to always learn to seek the will of God Lord I'm here which direction are you taking me to praise the name of our Lord I've reached here these are my limits these are my Guide Me The Way Forward praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we wait on the Lord praise the name of our Lord let us go to 12: 6 12 verse 6 the Bible says therefore turn though to thy God 12 ver 6 keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually he says wait praise the name of our Lord you are in a place you don't know how to go forward turn to God wait on the Lord and the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength praise the name of our Lord they shall renew their strength and you know God is so gracious that he permits the cces to come our lives but he always stands at that praise the name he stood at the Junctions of Jacob when Jacob was running away from es when the mother had told him go toan he R and he couldn't reach where he was going then he got into a place he was tired and then he laid on the stone the Bible says Heaven opened up for him and then the Lord spoke to him told him don't fear go where you going but go to reveal himself to Jacob he allowed things which had happened to him at the beginning and when Jacob was atan a number of years praise the name of and he felt he needed to start working for his family the Lord showed him how the animals would multiply every Junction the Lord is already standing there to show you the way praise the name of you just only need to be faithful only need to turn to the Lord and wait on Contin prise the name when Jacob was now tired of living with he was running away praise the name of our and then heard that Jacob has taken off he determined to go and pursue him what did God tell don't say anything good or bad to Jacob came and told him God warned me praise the name of and even Jacob on that road he met Angels praise the name of a confirmation of his exit that God plantion of disagreement at [Music] home where the children ofan we are telling Jacob you have taken all the wealth of our father and then Jacob said this is the time to exit so God stands at every Junction God is standing at every Junction of your life praise the name of our Lord so you even see that when Jacob stayed in a place near she praise the name of the Lord and then they had the daughter called dinner praise the name of our Lord and we have many dinners here praise the name of our Lord and you know what dinner did like now maybe you're living here in this place then din staying in that's where the family was staying so she took a leave goes to check on the city then he goes at the Lake Landing s here and the Bible says she mix with the daughter of the land and then you go to then you can get some of those people who are used to fishing for them they shower anywhere she went there and then she started commuting or communing with those people of the land the daughters of the land because there was a prince called sh you know people of the world the daughters of the world for them what after his recognition you have got a good husb the prince of the land said get me that girl and then I ended up being defiled praise the name of our so we should be careful of our walk you've gone to a place why do you want to find out what is happening here's Happening Here you may get in trouble like dinner praise the name of Lord she end up being def have values was not the values of those people of the land you know for them they can go out with any man who they think is successful is the boss the place of work if he takes you out you are a c no you don't defile yourself like that don't behave like the daughters of the L praise the name of Lord you a child of God so the values of a child of God should be held high in your life praise the name of at your place of work where you live maybe you have gone to collect water and then there are people there are back biting L everything you don't partake of their stuff praise the name of our Lord you are different praise the name of our Lord so when she defiled dinner and they told Jacob and then when the children of Jacob came back from farming and they heard that sh has defiled their sister they didn't just take it lightly so now at the end of the day she's father comes to Jacob I want my son to marry your daughter in the world that's what they do the man first sleeps with the woman says now she can be my but as a child of God you shouldn't do such a kind of praise the name of Lord I have to check if she can produce that's what the world does as a child of God you shouldn't do those kind of things brother you don't know you find out you are becoming demon possessed praise the name of our Lord you shouldn't do like that the world that's what they do you know I need to give her probation and probation can even be 10 years no that's how the world does but we are children of God we shouldn't behave like the world praise the name of our and then you can get one he's talking to Mary he's talking to J and he's talking to you know IR confusion that means you have a wrong Spirit one at a time talk to only one if she refuses then you know it's not not talking to this the other one the other one praise the name of you know you're not handing an objective question you have a no praise the name ofy eror praise the name of at time praise the name of the Lord so now you see that the children of Jacob they told their father let those be circumcised and the people were happy but can you imagine as this man the father of the king of the city when he came to talk to Jacob Jacob's daughter was at the boy [Music] they had no values they had no morals and that's what the world is they have no values you don't go after the world you don't do things the world does we are children of God praise the name of if a brother comes and talks to you and the brother has no kind of you know confidence maybe the Brother Talks to you but then the brother tells you there's something wrong with that there's something wrong and so people they just go into [Music] inboxing you know they just come to inform you you know we've been going that one is my friend when already decided you are in a firing Place praise the name of the Lord if somebody comes to you what are you interested in of course you may not be rude like that but then say I see the brother is now communicating with me frequently find out praise the name of tell others about it but now you want to keep it yourself I want to give you a surprise you may give a surprise of something bad praise the name of the Lord yeah you don't do things like that marriage is something at the end of it has to be in the public praise the name of the Lord it right if a brother is interested in a sister sister you don't say ah if I tell others they may go Ahad of me then it's not yours praise the name yeah be open and say now do you think is [Laughter] interested ah cus is now looking [Laughter] ahead praise the name so we should be careful so the children of Jacob they told Jacob let this be circumcised and all the men were circum and the scripture says Levi and Simeon on the third day when's wounds were they went to the city boldly that time started killing every male was every male was in the city they took the goods in the city and they removed even their sister dinner from now Jacob told them you have made me [Music] stink and Jacob was afraid this come and kill us and then Jacob started seeing that he gets a root away to run away from that place now God appeared to and told him go to the other place where you made an altar and Jacob told all the people clean up yourselves take away all the idols we are going to worship God and then the Bible says that the cities of the place they had planed to come and revenge on Jacob but God stood at that Junction praise the name of and then the Bible says God put his Terror cities until they wouldn't do anything wrong to Jacob praise the name of our why there was a purpose of God for Jacob praise the name of there is a purpose of God for your life regardless of the circumstances you've been going through regardless of the challenges you've been going through praise the name of our God still stands there to defend you to protect you until his purpose is fulfilled praise the name of our look what Abraham after he had got the promise of the son in Genesis 18 speaking with God Walking with God praise the name of our dining with God then a trial femine comes and then he goes to another land land and then he fears for his land tell sah allow them to take you tell them I'm your brother but you see the goodness of God coming down warning the king don't do any to that man God standing at the junction praise the name of that his purpose can be fulfilled in your life praise the name of you can look at the challenges you're going through every challenge you're going through God is standing right there praise the name of our let us go to Ephesians chapter 3 and then verse three how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the Min in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be FOH haers and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power for for praise the name of our Lord so he says how the Revelation has been made known to me of the mystery praise the name of our Lord and you know God at particular times he makes his secret known based on the circumstances based on the time the season praise the name of our when Jesus Christ had resurrected and then the disciples came to him in Acts one praise the name of our Lord in Acts chapter one can go and read there and then verse S and when therefore they were come together they asked him saying saying Lord will th at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel you know they were looking at his restoration of the Kingdom [Music] and then Jesus answers them and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power so there are things that God reserves to himself praise the name of our Lord and then he reveals it at a particular time he makes it known at a particular time and he holds some things that many times you don't know what's going to happen even today but then the thing we should we should have confidence in is that I have committed all my ways to God prise the name of they should give us contentment Lord I've done all that you wanted praise the name of Joseph when the father sent him to take food for his Brethren he didn't know that he's seeing the father for the last time until when he's almost going to die he didn't know for him he went he sees he goes to a place where his Brethren were raising from he doesn't find them then he asked the people of the L where are the Hebrews then they told him we heard them speak they go to the other place because there was not enough pasture over then he follows and now when the brethen saw him far look at the dream come let us what will come of his dream let us kill him praise the name of Joseph didn't know what was going on he didn't know that that same day he's being taken into slaver he didn't know praise the name of our but when his Breen wanted to kill him Reuben stood there to see that no harm is done even when Reuben went away Judas stood there let us not shed the blood of but let us tell him when they saw the isites coming so God had ordained everything that there was no pasture here this should go to a place where the root was for the isite to go to [Music] Egypt praise the name of and then he made sure that there was a hole there and the jealous and the envy and then God made sure that he showed Joseph the dreams of what is going to happen and then the Brethren hated the same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ if the Jews didn't hate him he wouldn't have been crucified praise the name of our Lord but God allowed them to hate Jesus to crucify him that salvation can come to us praise the name of our Lord so the same thing with Joseph he didn't know and then they just take him a slave and when they take him a slave he is bought by pilate pus rather by pitifer God orain that the purpose of God can be fulfilled in the life of Joseph praise the name of the Lord Joseph is there prosperous person and then in Egypt praise the name of they were speaking in tongues they were worshiping idols and the wife of porer was just like strip just a scrip and then sometimes you go to people's homes they just dress the way they want praise the name of they just dress the way they want you think po stripped from where from the street from home at home not in her bedroom maybe in the sitting room or in the kitchen or the compound like when you go to Villages you get those elderly women up is be and they sited there and then you go to believer's home they also want to do the same he's wife you shouldn't be like's wife praise the name of so Joseph at the end of the day is put in prison but God ordained everything that Joseph being a prisoner from P's house he was put in Max prison you know those big people in government those Chief criminals they don't put them in the same Chambers with the chicken thieves and things like that there's a special place where they put them and even Joseph was put in that special place until when the buler and the baker you know those work for for for pilot you know for Fara they also brought in the same chamber where Joseph see the plan of God then they had dreams and then God manifested Joseph's gift praise the name of one was killed one was restored after two solid God brings a dream to pharaoh and nobody would interpret it and now brother Bram tells us that God can not give a dream which is mysterious unless there is a prophet interpret he will give you an open dream like Joseph in the New Testament in MTH chapter 1 when he was thinking of putting Mary away the angel came to him in a dream and frankly told him don't put away Mary wife what she has conceived is of the Holy Spirit when the three wise men had seen Herod the god revealed to them in a dream don't go back to Herod don't use the same route you use use another route Open Dreams Joseph in the night again God told him take the child to Egypt because there was no Prophet to interpret that praise the name of our Lord so now you don't start getting a dream of symbols and then now you start buying these books of dreams you know when you dream when you you're going to get mbling until we have dream church but you can't stand on dreams you can't build your salvation on dreams you build your confidence on the word of God praise the name of so you see God has a purpose in everything how would the gift of Joseph be known if those prisoners from P's Pharaoh's house did not be in the same [Music] prison praise the name of our Lord so we need to allow God praise the name of our Lord to direct us he knows what he is doing praise the name of our Lord when you see things and are kind of like you can't understand wait on the Lord and say Lord here I am I don't know what I'm going through come and direct me come and guide me praise the name of come and give me strength praise the name of our Lord and then you'll see how the Lord will always come down to help you in thetion you are in now in the Satan Church age God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God praise the name of the Lord he says you wait on God lord what should I do you get it Lord which way should I take you're waiting on God now that you're asking him no I don't know the direction to go like maybe you're in ginger from here he says go TOA then we have waited on him he has told you to go to but you also need to wait for him to direct you which way to take praise the name of you wait on God which way you wait for God guide me be ahead of me praise the name of our Lord then he says this is the process of character development in other words you are there you are waiting like now when David was in a fix there are people you know I think the were the Philistines they had come and done damage killed some people taking even others to captivity now David he wouldn't do anything that even taken some of his wives so David what he did he waited on the Lord he called for the effort know like and then inquired of the lord lord what should I do can I pursue them will I find them will I restore these people and then the Lord told him pursue them but they didn't know where they were and so they kept on going until they got somebody there who was like kind of like you know of you know stranded then they asked him can you tell us where these people are then he told him if you don't kill me I take you where they are okay but it was all the direction of God and waiting on God until that young man took them where they were praise the name of our now Christian Life is entirely depending on God praise the name don't wake up one day you get in trouble you get messed up every stage in life seek that you depend on the Lord seek that you wait on the Lord Lord here I am what will you have me to do praise the name of our Lord Lord here I am what will you have me to do brother Bram he would see a vision of somebody getting healed God has showed him he would wait on God then God would show him a vision and now when God shows him a vision in that Vision there are particular aspects maybe the patient is on the bed and maybe another person is dressed in this color and is SE in this chair and then maybe this cup is here so he would watch those details so he would know that God is going to heal this person then he comes and he waits for God's time why don't you pray for him said wait so he sits there waiting until everything plays out as it was in the vision Waiting for God at the right time Jesus told them it's not for you to know the times and the seasons because God will Reve it when that time comes praise the name of our Lord how he's going to do it I don't know but he's going to do it praise the name of that should give us confidence in the midst of the challenges we are going through in the midst of the STS you're going through it should give you confidence praise the name of our Lord like Paul he says I know whom I have believed praise the name of and have committed to him how about us have we committed everything to him you've committed your family you committed your life to him youve committed your place of work to you committed everything about you to him and so you are not in any shock if anything happens you say Lord this is destraction Lord guide me which direction I should praise the name of our Lord then brother Brown continues to say how high God has commanded this sense of the Dark Ages patient as lamps led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they served God that is is all they wanted out of life just service to their God how great was their reward praise the name of our how we need to depend upon God in everything that we do praise the name of our Lord let us go to Hebrews chapter 12 and then verse one Bible says wherefor seeing we are all encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does easily beset us and let us run with patience the rest that is set before us the name of Lord he said see we have a great cloud of witness Hebrews chapter 11 you know it goes talks about every circumstance people went through whatever we are going through and then the Lord will show how they were overcoming praise the name of our Lord so he says there are a great cloud of witness so then the Bible tells us let us lay aside every weight praise the name of our there are some weights you are carrying and they taking you nowhere them aside praise the name of our Lord you know there are some burdens we keep on putting on our backs praise the name of the Lord you want to be in this kind of thing you want to be in the other kind of thing you want to be in the other kind of there are some of those we which are not necessary to come praise the name of the Lord so you put them aside blessed be the name of our Lord and now one thing for example is our introductions you get an introduction and then the music that they are putting there people become un Christians and then you get maybe the bride they ask which song then it talks of the name then she starts Ming now go down [Music] slowly wait you want say my function has to be like this but see the world which has cting see the reproach being brought the name of Christ praise the name of and then when girls come toet they tellys that attack attack then you start wondering where did the C is this culture or when the when the boys come the the in-laws they call them inlaws they tell the girls of women and then they give them belts then they come and tie told you start dancing with you even cure that's not cure but we have allowed it we have put it back on our back and sometimes if if you go in some of those places maybe you have escorted then you also go and attack and then you'll find this man here dancing with a strange woman has never with the wife that's never but you know the spirit which is there it's like the spirit which took on the children of Israel when the moabites were dancing with them the Feast of because these women were for them they had no shame the men had no shame they in seductive way you know just to entice now for you are there then the spirit jumps on you destruction their weights we are carrying weights we are carry oh my function should be good that brother speak then you get the other one who promotes those of and Christ is not seen at home there and this has happened in many Believers homes and sometimes the family of the girl is a Believer the family of the boy is a Believer they have authority what is happening in the but then they are mom they also enjoying the spirit has got a hold of you know you see the days we're living and sometimes you even get offended you get offended in the things the name of and me personally I don't record praise the name of why would I record something which is offensive I will not record that but these are the things we have allowed the world to creep in we are carrying a weight because you want to please somebody but the Bible says praise the name of the Lord let us go to Second Timothy 2 vers praise the name of the Lord second Timothy 2 verse1 though therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses the same commit though to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also though therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth entangles himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier and if a man also strive for masteries yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully praise the name of our Lord he says You must please the one who has called you when you are in Waring don't entangle yourself with the Affairs of this life how the world does this also do the same there will be no difference but then here the Bible says we have a rest we running it's a race that is set before us and then the Bible says we run with patience praise the name of our Lord rest there are challenges along the way and Christ expects us to run in the right way to strive lawfully you know the way he has ordained it to be praise the name of our Lord why we are pressing to the mark of the High Calling of Christ and our High Calling is to be the Bride of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord how can you be the bride of Christ and you're messing yourself with the things of the world how praise the name of our Lord you are a young a young woman your fi has promised you to come and pick you for marriage and then you are busy talking with different men you look good you're messing with the world mixing with this with this you don't do that praise the name of our Lord so now the Bible tells us in second Timothy 2 verse 19 he says neveress the foundation of God stand sure having this seal the Lord knows them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from says name the name of the Lord depart from iniquity praise the name of the Lord depart from it and don't be used to doing evil [Music] don't do that praise the name of our Lord if you do it the Lord have Mery don't deliver me out of this help me to overcome my weaknesses praise the name of the Lord so the Bible says we shouldn't entangle ourselves with the Affairs of this let us depart from iniquity Others May do it and they have no conviction Others May do it and well life goes on normally but for us praise the name of we have a covenant praise the name of our Lord we have the Covenant of the Holy Spirit we need to keep that Covenant pure and then Stand by Your confession praise the name of our Lord I'm a Child of God I'm not going to defile myself I'm a daughter of God I'm not going to dance like the daughters of this world I'm a Child of God I'm not going to behave like the men of the world praise the name of our I'm a Child of God I'm not going to allow my body to be used of Satan praise the name of our I'm not going to allow my body to be a tool of Satan I'm not going to allow myself to be a vessel of thison but I want myself to be a horor of a vessel of honor and the Bible says if any man PGE himself from these things shall be a vessel unto Sanctified and meet for the Master's you prepared unto every good work in other words I'm yielding myself I'm offering my body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God I desire the purpose of God to be done in my life so I Surrender myself I said Lord here I am use me praise the name of our you know Isaiah he was looking at until died and then that Idol was Tor up praise the name of our we have so many idols let us tear those Idols that are Us Praise the name of our Lord they the idols sometimes our Idols are on Facebook sometimes our idols on Tik Tok sometimes our idols on all the social media on radios on television praise the name of our like now you can find The Woman married at home praise the name of and she always likes the talk shows you know now since these steps are put on radio you don't talk about those talk shows now you can't mention them by name you can know did you hear today they this you know those days was Niger and people were consing from Nigeria for marri yourself from those things take away those Idols praise the name don't look at that look to the word of God then you become a vessel of Honor praise the name of our Lord and then he says you'll be good prepared for the Master's use prepared for the purpose of God for your life he wants to use Us Praise the name of our Lord but how will he use you if you dirty have to clean yourself like isah goded somebody to but Isaiah wasan praise the name of our Lord so now when he saw the presence of God he confessed of his sins un clean praise the name of the Lord the sarim came and cleaned him then the Lord said the sarim told him now you are clean your iniquity has been taken away praise the name of our now you don't need to wait for the sarapin right now we have the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our it washes us every time we have the blood of Jesus CHR that cleanses us that makes us whole and so we look to the lamb and Lord like those lepers they were crying to Christ I'm unan we have the blood of Jesus Christ we are also we can be also unclean through the things that we do through the things that we think through the things that you know we speak you can be unclean the blood of Jesus christes us from all unri praise the name of our Lord we allow that blood to wash us from all unrighteousness so now the Bible says still in second Timothy Chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord and then verse verse 22 flee also youthful L but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart praise the name of the Lord says flee those follow righteousness fath charity peace with them that call on the name of the praise the name of Lord every day we need to do that to be ready for the Master's use to be ready to fulfill the purpose of God for our Liv Lord here we living at the time of the coming of the Lord praise the name of our will he find you ready praise the name of the Lord we need to be ready make sure everything you do every day is acceptable unto God you are doing something that is the good pleasure of God something that is delighted in praise the name of our Lord you fulfilling all the good pleasure like in second Thessalonians 1 and then verse 11 the Bible says wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and work of Faith with power praise the name of our Lord that should be our desire Lord let me fulfill your good pleas let me be found doing what you want me to let me be found doing your Delight praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that we seek that we wait on the Lord we call upon the name of the Lord and then he will direct us where his purpose is where his will is what he has called us to do and fulfill in our Liv praise the name of our God I just want to read this quote as I try to fin praise the name of the Lord now in the message let me get it here Revelation 3 he says God placed the first man Adam and Eve right here on free moral ages he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this fixed in here in here is your own self will Hallelujah yourself will you have to will to do God's will praise the name of Lord you have to to do God way Lord what will you have me to do like when they askah who will I say Isaiah now has had the confidence to do the will of God here I am send me Lord praise the name of and right now the gospel has been going on come on me your and I will give you rest rest unto your soul so when the call is made you come to Christ Lord here I am and when you come to Christ give him your weight give him your burdens aside all your weight Here Am have control over my life I am nothing look at Paul having heard the instructions from the high priest when Christ met him on the way he changed the order so Paul no longer went to the Pharisees but he had high command he had a high calling we have also got a high calling to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and there are so many things that happen that can spot you that can wrinkle you that can bring blemishes get away from those things praise the name of our that the purpose of God is clear in your life so you are getting rid of self and allowing God's will then he says to let you have to get rid of your own will to let God's will coming for this is the only channel that leads to the heart then he says but you have to do God's way to let the Holy Spirit come in here to bring forth praise the name of you subscribe to the word of God you surrender to the word of God praise the name and doing the will of God is to allow the Holy Spirit to lead you praise the name of our Lord as many as are led by the spirit of they are the children of praise the name of our you know we are living at the time of the r praise the name of our Lord but how are you going to make sure that you're not going to be left behind praise the name of our like Simeon the Bible says he was a just and devote man and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel he was waiting for the Messiah in the Book of Luke Chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord Luke chap 2 and then we read in verse 25 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devot waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him just and devot in other words like filled with the Holy SP living according to the word of God the Holy Ghost was upon he was waiting we are waiting for the rapture we are waiting for the change of our bodies so every day you are looking for the Lord Lord if you are coming today let me be found let me be found worthy praise the name of Lord not giving room to things which are wrong I think today I can do something wrong tomorrow I make it right you don't give that wrong supposing he comes today praise the name of our Lord so he was waiting and the Bible says the Holy Ghost was upon him and then the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he should not die before he sees the Lord is Christ and we have got the message that prepares us for the rapture we got the message that makes us the Bride of Jesus Christ we need to take the message seriously with all your heart and you pray God I have read this give me more power more strength more ability that all your word is alive in me praise the name of our so the Bible says the Holy Ghost was upon and the Holy Ghost revealed to sim that you are not going to die until you see the Lord is Christ now it is so interesting that the same Holy Spirit which had revealed to Simeon when Jesus was brought into the temple the Holy Ghost took Simeon Jesus was there were hundreds of babies in the temple but the Holy Ghost was not gambling right on spot and that's the same thing for our rupture if we have the message of the hour we are ready we are filled with the Holy Spirit whether the Rapture comes when I'm in bed I will go comes I will go comes preparing a me I will go why because it has been revealed to us praise the name of that the coming of the Lord is at time praise the name of our Lord and then the scripture say Comfort one another with these words we have heard the shout the message of the hour praise the name of our Lord we are now waiting the voice of resurrection and when the voice of Resurrection sounds praise the name of our we shall see our brothers in our Med who went before us and now when we see them then we know in time our bodies are going to be Chang in a moment in a twinkling of night praise the name of our Lord then after seeing them maybe about 40 days we shall he at the Trump of God come up praise the name of our and then we go to the wedding supper the name of the purpose of his way he has called us that we can be his children and it's God himself working out all these things we just only say Lord here I am just say Lord I give you all my life Lord I'm unan this is my weakness when Daniel the angel was talking to him and Daniel was weak Daniel had confess oh my Lord I'm weak weak I'm weak and then the angel said be strong praise the name of our Lord and the word of God has that power when Daniel heard that word be strong gain the strength praise the name of even us when we hear the word of God be clean I said Lord I'm washing myself now in the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord don't allow anything to come in your life and fail the purpose of God praise the name of the Lord don't allow anything to come in your life frustrate you know what the Lord has need of but just say Lord guide me Lord direct me Lord show me the way praise the name of our may God bless you [Applause] Amen Let Us sing a song as brother Moses comes praise the name of our
