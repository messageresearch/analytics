[14:42] I don't want anything to go wrong okay

[15:05] amen
[15:33] she has a bad condition
[15:38] that is uh
[15:41] literally putting her down
[15:47] she's a very young lady
[15:51] but she has to have a walking stick to
[15:54] get around
[15:59] it's not good to go on clutches at that
[16:02] age
[16:05] so
[16:07] we are going to put our faith together
[16:09] because
[16:14] she is being suggested
[16:19] to be taken for a spinal
[16:22] surgery
[16:28] but we can pray
[16:30] that God the creator of heavens and
[16:36] earth
[16:37] can create a new spy eyes
[16:46] let this be a testimony to us
[16:50] that we serve a living God
[16:54] just put your faith together with me
[16:58] let us stand up now don't leave this to
[17:02] me alone
[17:04] everybody has brought a leak of fire
[17:08] and so we need to lift up our hearts
[17:11] foreign
[18:11] foreign

[19:35] watch for The Testament
[19:37] amen amen so you may be seated I've got
[19:41] another
[19:43] uh
[19:45] special
[19:48] thing to put out of their way
[19:53] I want to invite
[19:56] amen
[20:07] this is Brother Martin
[20:12] Brother Martin is a very
[20:24] he has got a group of his young people
[20:29] that he has mobilized together
[20:33] and he does a lot of ministry our own
[20:36] life
[20:38] so any of you that do not know that
[20:44] just not the channel
[20:47] and just listen to the sermons
[20:51] that brother martin preachers
[20:59] we are going to allow him to stand
[21:02] behind our desks
[21:07] so in his life
[21:10] is somebody special
[21:13] and let her come foreign
[21:38] amen Amina so now
[21:44] we need to know from the bridegroom

[21:53] Grace

[22:03] morning
[22:05] to announce the engagement
[22:09] and also marriage plans
[22:15] between our brother martin and our
[22:18] sister Comfort Grace
[22:25] Comfort is one of those young girls who
[22:28] have grown up with us
[22:31] but when the Lord gives us the gift of
[22:34] life
[22:36] life just flourishes like that
[22:40] children become women
[22:44] and now they become mothers
[22:47] and not long after that
[22:53] amen amen so we serve a living God
[22:56] because we used to see some of the
[22:59] people growing before us
[23:02] amen sister plus is a good example
[23:08] and then
[23:22] she is now a grandmother
[23:27] isn't that wonderful
[23:29] sometimes as the ministers
[23:32] we don't see that we are aging away
[23:36] when I first traveled to North America
[23:39] North America I was working with elder
[23:43] ministers
[23:50] and many others brother Doug Matthews
[23:56] but right now when I was there yes
[24:00] most of the ministers
[24:02] are younger people
[24:06] so we need the younger people
[24:09] to come and stand in the garden
[24:12] because we are walking away we are not
[24:16] going to be here foreign
[24:39] [Music]
[24:54] so it's going to be here

[36:40] [Music]
[36:50] [Music]
[36:57] baby
[37:00] praise the lord
[37:01] it's a good Easter morning
[37:05] it's the rising of the sun
[37:09] amen Amina praise the Lord so
[37:14] um
[37:15] we know that Bible teaching is a little
[37:19] treacherous
[37:22] but then every teacher
[37:26] must not teach the people away from
[37:29] scripture
[37:32] because our Prophet
[37:35] was a Biblical teacher
[37:38] amen amen so the problem
[37:42] is that men who have read their message
[37:48] they read it not side by side with the
[37:52] Bible
[37:55] but we thank God he has given us the
[37:59] grace
[38:00] to put the two together
[38:03] and we can never go wrong
[38:06] I believe you all have the seven seal
[38:10] book it is
[38:15] so I want you to go
[38:18] and start the the bridge
[38:22] between the seven Church edges and the
[38:26] Seven Seals
[38:32] you see I like that message
[38:36] because it teaches us the fullness of
[38:39] redemption
[38:42] you may not really be able to understand
[38:45] it fully
[38:48] but when you come next Sunday
[38:52] you are going to be able to piece up
[38:55] those missing links that you could not
[38:58] put together
[39:03] because I love people
[39:06] who study abasama and develop questions
[39:19] so I just choose this message
[39:23] foreign
[39:38] [Music]
[40:24] foreign
[40:44] [Music]
[40:49] the message bridge
[40:51] is what gives a man
[40:54] of true Founders
[40:57] in this message amen amen let's stand up
[41:01] and get to the scripture reading Romans
[41:19] there is therefore now no condemnation
[41:24] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[41:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[41:30] spiritual
[41:36] is
[41:40] let's buy heads and other prayer
[41:44] father he said for me we bow our heads
[41:49] to go take him into a day because the
[41:52] hearts are bowed before you Quran
[41:55] we are before a supernatural presence
[42:00] and there is nowhere Heavenly Father
[42:04] we can be able to have this Fellowship
[42:09] unless your grace
[42:12] Texas
[42:15] where are we don't here by the natural
[42:20] hereby that he that is
[42:40] foreign
[42:58] and so
[43:00] you know when the court is is Set uh
[43:10] there are certain processes that always
[43:15] happens
[43:16] there is a criminal
[43:19] [Music]
[43:20] and then there is a judge
[43:24] many times
[43:30] so you know
[43:33] then the accused that the prosecutors
[43:39] and mentions because
[43:43] this Christ of Nazareth
[43:47] claims to be God yeah
[43:51] and in the case of Christ anyway
[43:55] there was no Advocates
[44:01] there is a
[44:16] [Music]
[44:26] that there is
[44:29] a loss of the case certain times
[44:37] when he was bringing your Redemption
[44:41] he did not pass through a court system
[44:45] he brought it directly to you yeah
[44:50] you didn't have to prove you are sinless
[44:52] you are not concerned
[44:54] because you didn't go through a Judicial
[44:57] System
[45:01] are you getting where I'm going this
[45:04] morning
[45:06] that's what Grace means
[45:09] that Grace just comes
[45:11] when that you know Courtney said
[45:15] and the master says
[45:18] there is no case here
[45:21] is forgiveness
[45:25] so my title this morning
[45:30] by passing the judicial system
[45:35] foreign
[46:29] [Music]
[46:33] amen Amina we shall understand it better
[46:36] together
[46:38] by passing the judicial system upstairs
[46:42] the power money of the Easter seal again
[46:48] amen Amina that's where we are going to
[46:51] work from
[46:52] so the Bible call in the Bible refers to
[46:55] the mystical Body of Christ
[47:00] that is chosen out of the church
[47:07] spiritual wife to Christ
[47:12] and God has chosen the institution of
[47:17] the Bible marriage
[47:20] to Define this relationship
[47:25] amen Amina so the true Bible marriage
[47:30] husband and wife the little Israeli
[47:34] Define the relationship of Christ at
[47:37] this church
[47:40] Christians
[47:42] because their marriages must be a clean
[47:45] Testament
[47:48] concerning Christ's relationship with
[47:51] the church
[47:53] yes
[48:00] so when the Bible speaks of holy women
[48:04] I want you to see them as women that
[48:09] were showing us images
[48:11] [Music]
[48:20] [Music]
[48:21] we
[48:22] [Music]
[48:25] got women like a Mary anymore
[48:29] to look at those
[48:32] with the land years of the true church
[48:38] and foreign
[49:06] [Music]
[49:33] amen
[50:28] [Music]
[50:39] [Music]
[50:43] as a teacher
[50:47] are you together with me what is it he
[50:49] was the manifested
[50:53] that is now the restored to the church
[50:57] in the last days
[51:01] amen when Christ came among using he
[51:06] came as the teacher
[51:07] amen amen that's the Sonoma
[51:11] he's always a teaching Prophet now
[51:13] everybody
[51:22] they always say thus says the Lord
[51:26] we're bringing the word to the people
[51:29] even when Jesus came here he would also
[51:34] teach the wife
[51:36] [Music]
[51:39] so as the boy
[51:41] by faith we stand on the sure word of
[51:46] Prophecy
[51:49] and then I want you to see that these
[51:53] women in the Bible
[51:56] they always reflected in this time
[52:01] that the church has today
[52:05] are you together
[52:07] the faithfulness of Surah to Abraham
[52:12] interprets to us
[52:14] amen Amina amen amen
[52:19] the faithfulness
[52:21] that we as the brother
[52:26] amen amen so the faithfulness of Sorrow
[52:30] to Abraham
[52:34] speaks of the church
[52:37] amen amen in Hebrews chapter 11.
[52:41] we are going to look at these women
[52:44] how their lives were always challenging
[52:48] because a woman
[52:51] represents the church
[52:54] if the people want to know about to have
[52:56] a documentary the standard of our church
[53:00] they are going to look at the women that
[53:03] come to the church
[53:06] how would they behave themselves
[53:10] how they do their faces
[53:15] you reflect the standard of the church
[53:19] and your opinions and marriage in you I
[53:23] mean you your obedience in the marriage
[53:26] amen you also testify
[53:31] of the standard of the church
[53:54] [Music]
[54:16] [Music]
[54:27] [Music]
[54:32] women don't have
[54:48] women don't have food
[54:51] but you see the scripture says to the
[54:54] country
[54:56] women know how to enter into the spirit
[55:02] they know how to enter into the spirit
[55:05] of their husbands
[55:07] when certain things are failing
[55:11] the mother says I will handle your
[55:13] father don't mind mama
[55:16] she knows how to enter into the spirit
[55:20] just like the church would know how to
[55:23] enter into the spirit of Christ
[55:30] wants to teach us about the church
[55:33] he talks I mean he talks women
[55:39] meaning women are Faith
[55:43] received their dead rest life again
[55:47] we've got Elijah to Greninja Anderson
[55:58] [Music]
[56:22] [Music]
[56:41] [Music]

[1:07:33] quick it is
[1:07:35] the faith that brought the loved ones
[1:07:38] back to life is
[1:07:42] the same thing
[1:07:44] God has given to the brother
[1:07:47] to use so that she herself
[1:07:51] and come to her body
[1:07:55] amen so I truly believe that before the
[1:08:00] church can have instructions

[1:10:10] is literally personal contact
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:11:07] that's not your revenge
[1:11:19] is not via the rich younger ruler
[1:11:23] Doctrine
[1:11:26] but I have done these things
[1:11:30] you may not have smoked you may not have
[1:11:34] drank
[1:11:36] your services

[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:44] are you together with it one is it God
[1:13:46] bypass the judiciousness
[1:13:49] preaching is wonderful
[1:13:52] and sometimes it catches us in our
[1:13:55] position
[1:13:56] and then realize we are sin I went to
[1:13:59] America and then we get that Godly soul
[1:14:02] for sin
[1:14:05] but there are so many people that have
[1:14:09] cried about their sins
[1:14:11] but they don't abide
[1:14:14] they walk away
[1:14:16] they don't receive it they just got
[1:14:19] sorrowful
[1:14:21] and the body was lived in the same
[1:14:24] we always have the feeling of course
[1:14:28] are you together with me but that
[1:14:31] condemnation
[1:14:38] the judicial system
[1:14:41] and then it comes to you
[1:14:55] that you never did it from the beginning
[1:15:01] there has always been another Spirit
[1:15:05] the spirit of the sport
[1:15:08] is the one who did that now in the name
[1:15:12] of Jesus
[1:15:16] and you need to have your peace
[1:15:19] just being justified by faith
[1:15:23] we have faith with god
[1:15:26] he has Justified us
[1:15:29] he has taken away the root of seeds
[1:15:33] he has declared
[1:15:35] a son and the daughter of God
[1:15:39] where does that come from again
[1:16:37] went out there to see them
[1:16:40] they make the communion wine for the
[1:16:42] church

[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:01] you started looking for the spirit
[1:18:05] he couldn't find them and then God came
[1:18:09] down
[1:18:10] and told him ask him how many do you
[1:18:13] like yeah
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:26] [Laughter]
[1:18:37] so that's what they were talking about
[1:18:40] it's just happened a few days before
[1:18:44] and while sitting around that they were
[1:18:47] talking about
[1:18:49] all at once I say
[1:18:53] just
[1:18:57] I said brother right you are anonymous
[1:19:02] haunted Spirits all your life
[1:19:08] your brother Shelby you were unexpected
[1:19:16] also I invited them since the key
[1:19:21] did you ever see a squirrel in this
[1:19:24] ticket
[1:19:28] and they said
[1:19:33] I want you to see how God gets close
[1:19:37] you should always pay very close
[1:19:40] attention
[1:19:43] when you come to the house
[1:19:47] look at how you know Jesus took that
[1:19:50] woman at the well
[1:19:54] one step at a time
[1:19:58] until she said
[1:20:01] that I know
[1:20:03] you are the one the prophet to come
[1:20:09] foreign
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:44] you don't come here they don't know to
[1:20:47] hear an intellectual uh preach
[1:20:50] it is
[1:20:53] a man today was so special
[1:20:58] you come to touch God
[1:21:01] in that message maybe he's telling his
[1:21:05] experience
[1:21:08] like brother Brandon was telling his
[1:21:10] experience
[1:21:12] but that's where the channel
[1:21:16] to get to the boys
[1:21:20] maybe when you come down here
[1:21:23] what you needed so wait wait is the
[1:21:26] testimony of sisters
[1:21:28] for you to get also in the channel to
[1:21:32] bring down the supernatural
[1:21:38] Hallelujah
[1:22:15] [Music]

[1:22:51] God bless you brother
[1:22:55] handclap
[1:23:01] praise the Lord foreign
[1:23:28] through our composition
[1:23:32] I took a series here
[1:23:35] how the dead Race
[1:23:37] by a simple question from Sister Maria
[1:23:40] here
[1:23:42] and we've got about 20 Services
[1:23:46] when we are together and we are children
[1:23:49] of God we should watch for God in one
[1:23:52] another
[1:23:55] amen Amina she says that's nothing but
[1:23:59] the truth sister
[1:24:01] and when she said the right thing okay
[1:24:05] let's go back to you when she said that
[1:24:07] all right okay the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:24:09] off in the channel again
[1:24:12] every one of them
[1:24:16] I said sister my sister sister
[1:24:28] the holy spirit is speaking to me now
[1:24:32] and said to me to give you the desire of
[1:24:36] your house
[1:24:39] yes sir she was able to twelve the Holy
[1:24:44] Spirit
[1:24:45] to the
[1:24:48] points
[1:24:53] in the beginning foreign
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:25:22] you don't have to give up when you can
[1:25:25] keep training
[1:25:28] she trailed
[1:25:30] that you know Fellowship okay and then
[1:25:34] the prophecy says ask for the desire
[1:25:37] and then she was confused
[1:25:40] if the Holy Spirit
[1:25:46] God wants to this for you right now say
[1:25:49] what you want if I was here
[1:25:57] because when God needed
[1:26:00] to come to the resurrection he says
[1:26:03] Lazarus come forward
[1:26:06] why did I mention him if I were him I
[1:26:10] would take the promise
[1:26:12] amen amen you know I said now if I be
[1:26:19] God's servant
[1:26:20] if it will happen if I had God's
[1:26:24] suffered
[1:26:26] and it won't happen I'm a deceiver I
[1:26:30] said now try and see
[1:26:31] what is the spirit of God
[1:26:38] and everyone who was crying she said
[1:26:42] what shall I asked

[1:26:49] amen I had twenty dollars in my pockets
[1:26:55] that she had put in the foreign

[1:28:10] now listen
[1:28:11] her boys
[1:28:15] had got to be regular rickies
[1:28:22] I mean school days
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:33] and 15 16 years old
[1:28:38] and all they were standing over there
[1:28:41] laughing at what I was saying
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:46] it sounds like a soul could say
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:16] is God
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:39] ask for your sister
[1:29:46] I knew then like a job
[1:29:50] there is just something you know when
[1:29:54] you strike it while you waiting to it
[1:30:06] is happiness
[1:30:38] was going into the prayer line
[1:30:41] he wouldn't say nothing
[1:30:43] he would just be fellowshipping here and
[1:30:46] there
[1:30:49] he says I'm waiting on here
[1:30:52] immediately knows when he strikes that
[1:30:55] channel
[1:31:00] okay
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:40] you are going to come down here and give
[1:31:42] a testimony
[1:31:44] amen Amina so
[1:31:47] I I I I knew
[1:31:50] here I stand before about 10 people
[1:31:55] I said if it doesn't happen then I'm a
[1:31:58] false prophet
[1:32:03] because
[1:32:04] I said it's up to you
[1:32:07] make your decisions
[1:32:09] I cannot make your decisions she looked
[1:32:14] around
[1:32:14] a little woman and all at once
[1:32:18] Jesus
[1:32:27] they were laughing they were coughing
[1:32:31] about our brother
[1:32:34] was acting
[1:32:36] the presence
[1:32:38] he was just up and down
[1:32:41] you can ask foreign
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:33:02] he did not look at the yesterday of
[1:33:04] souls
[1:33:06] did not look up the yesterday of the man
[1:33:09] at the cross
[1:33:11] I tell you when it's going to save you
[1:33:15] bypasses the judicious
[1:33:18] because all I'm sinned and come short of
[1:33:21] the glory of God
[1:33:24] you are not an exceptions
[1:33:38] you are
[1:33:41] going to be worried because you are not
[1:33:45] sure
[1:33:46] because you know there are certain
[1:33:49] things behind this
[1:33:52] is
[1:33:54] he does not look at you yesterday
[1:33:59] he didn't look at the yesterday of those
[1:34:01] boys foreign
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:34] do you believe when he was coming your
[1:34:36] way
[1:34:38] he did not look at you yesterday
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:53] and it convicts us to see it
[1:34:56] it's not our sorrow to sin that saves us
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:11] amen Titus Chapter three
[1:35:14] amen verse 5.
[1:35:19] not by works of righteousness see why
[1:35:21] because
[1:35:23] which we have died
[1:35:25] now Paul is not saying you've not done
[1:35:29] them
[1:35:32] he says you have done this
[1:35:35] you are like the rich younger rules
[1:35:40] but yet your good works is not what
[1:35:45] saves you
[1:35:46] the Easter sealer
[1:35:51] when Jesus broke death yes
[1:35:55] that's what releases
[1:35:57] the grace that saves us
[1:36:02] not by walks of righteousness which we
[1:36:04] have died
[1:36:06] but according to his mercies
[1:36:09] he saved us by the washing of
[1:36:12] regeneration
[1:36:14] and renewing of the Holy ghosts
[1:36:21] through Jesus Christ
[1:36:27] that being justified by his grace
[1:36:35] according to the hope of eternal life
[1:36:41] that being justified by Grace
[1:36:45] not through the future of the Lord
[1:36:50] because by the fruit of the law you lose
[1:36:54] it
[1:36:56] so look at the grace of Calvary this is
[1:37:02] foreign
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:38:12] that Jesus has given you his grace
[1:38:37] it was death by firing squad
[1:38:44] and many times
[1:38:47] you know brother Branham talks about it
[1:38:51] but a pattern was written by President
[1:38:54] Abraham Lincoln is because
[1:39:01] you know this boy here
[1:39:04] hard to personally
[1:39:08] give the pardon to the Executioner yeah
[1:39:16] execution and the one who is going to
[1:39:18] hang him
[1:39:20] but then due to the hurry
[1:39:26] it was not this pattern was not written
[1:39:30] on the letterhead
[1:39:35] amen letterheads
[1:39:40] amen Amina and you see it also had to
[1:39:43] have a sale
[1:39:47] don't think so we're not there I mean
[1:39:49] and this young man
[1:39:52] rejected it yet because of the
[1:39:56] Simplicity of How It Was Written
[1:40:03] yeah
[1:40:05] Hallelujah
[1:40:09] I just wish you can understand
[1:40:13] that's your mind
[1:40:16] keeps telling you you've not done enough
[1:40:18] to be saved yes
[1:40:23] and your mind keeps you under
[1:40:25] condemnation
[1:40:29] so this boy condemned himself to death
[1:40:35] but a pattern in the external world
[1:40:38] could not be written on such a simple
[1:40:40] page
[1:40:46] when the curse was tried in the court um
[1:40:51] when white the boy was executed
[1:40:55] when the boy was executed
[1:41:03] you see
[1:41:04] foreign
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:31] laughs
[1:41:32] so he had nothing to show against his
[1:41:36] judgments
[1:41:48] I know there are many here in Detroit
[1:41:51] but feel the condemnation
[1:41:54] they feel a pull to come to church
[1:41:58] and they come down here however no but
[1:42:02] they've never been assured
[1:42:04] amen of their salvation
[1:42:07] today I want you to learn from this year
[1:42:12] you should not reject your path
[1:42:15] you should stand before the devil and
[1:42:19] tell him I am justified
[1:42:23] amen and the verdict was passed by the
[1:42:27] federal judge
[1:42:31] that a pardon is not a pattern
[1:42:35] if not accepted as a pad
[1:42:38] are you together with me a pardon is not
[1:42:42] a patterns
[1:42:48] foreign
[1:43:21] it
[1:43:26] comes directly to you
[1:43:30] oh yeah that's what is to me
[1:43:35] the judge himself
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:51] that when you stand before death
[1:43:53] sentence
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:37] see you complicate your salvation
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:30] thank you
[1:45:33] now the system to bypass the Judicial
[1:45:36] Systems
[1:45:39] stems from the Shadows of the law every
[1:45:42] day
[1:45:44] that will help in the presence of
[1:45:46] judgment
[1:45:49] Grace will always be somewhere
[1:45:55] doesn't matter since
[1:46:02] but when you release on it you hold on
[1:46:05] it
[1:46:07] releases the showers
[1:46:10] of the washing Waters of the world
[1:46:15] foreign
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:49] you know the devil standing can never
[1:46:52] allow you that in South Ghana to see the
[1:46:54] good that's in you
[1:46:59] every time because he's called I mean
[1:47:04] he's a condom yeah
[1:47:08] he can't encourage you on God
[1:47:14] he can't do that he just keeps you know
[1:47:19] foreign
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:48:01] are you together with it so CeCe was not
[1:48:04] his campaign
[1:48:06] he has only had to bring out the back
[1:48:10] as long as the devil is not the
[1:48:13] campaigner of God
[1:48:16] He will always be disappointing at your
[1:48:19] weak area
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:24] and when you look at that
[1:48:27] you cannot receive Department
[1:48:30] you get into battle
[1:48:32] you sink into the pressure okay
[1:48:38] foreign
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:29] that's Grace okay so by passing
[1:49:32] judgments
[1:49:33] are you together with it what is it amen
[1:49:36] Grace was before the Lord exactly myself
[1:49:42] and I mean during the law
[1:49:45] and after the Lord amen amen but could
[1:49:50] not be enforced
[1:49:53] as long as the law was still in its
[1:49:57] proper place
[1:50:00] so God who is reaching in myself
[1:50:05] did not want anybody
[1:50:17] you know many people don't like the
[1:50:20] preaching of God's grace
[1:50:24] but there is no way
[1:50:27] you will never save yourself
[1:50:29] if you bypass
[1:50:32] singles the grace you'll stand before
[1:50:36] the Lord
[1:50:40] you see what I mean
[1:50:42] God who is rich in mercies
[1:50:46] never wanted you to die in your seats
[1:50:50] listen about this woman who was coaching
[1:50:54] a doubt
[1:50:59] praise God
[1:51:00] every time
[1:51:04] looks for a way of setting you free
[1:51:35] you begin to get gloomy
[1:51:43] foreign
[1:52:08] hahaha
[1:52:09] so now in verse John 8 7.
[1:52:14] he says so when they continued asking
[1:52:18] him
[1:52:19] he lifted up himself
[1:52:25] what is that he that is without sin
[1:52:28] among you
[1:52:30] let him fast cast the first story
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] that he can save himself
[1:52:42] let him cast the fastest
[1:52:48] they discovered they are under the same
[1:52:51] bracket
[1:52:53] they all needed the grace of God
[1:52:58] when he brought them before the Lord
[1:53:01] they needed
[1:53:04] they discovered they cannot be perfect
[1:53:07] but in the midst of the Lord
[1:53:12] everyone who came with the storm
[1:53:15] dropped one stone
[1:53:22] and then it says or 20 years ago he
[1:53:25] throws up
[1:53:26] yeah
[1:53:30] and then Jesus lifts up in his face
[1:53:35] and he says where are your choosers
[1:53:47] say that to her yes
[1:53:54] oh no
[1:53:56] so Grace is not encouraging adults

[2:25:08] by faitha
[2:25:15] you have to take it by faith
[2:25:18] if you take it by faith then he says we
[2:25:22] have peace with God
[2:25:28] if we take a justification
[2:25:31] when you say God put it in the sea of
[2:25:35] his forgetfulness
[2:25:38] you get your peace
[2:25:44] foreign
[2:26:16] three things
[2:26:19] he reproves

[2:26:33] he gives an independent scripture
[2:26:42] righteousness
[2:26:49] because they believe not on me
[2:26:54] amen so he rebukes the world
[2:27:01] because they believe not on him
[2:27:07] and because they don't belong they
[2:27:10] commit sins
[2:27:17] is what the yeah
[2:27:39] you are a Believer
[2:27:42] flips the scriptures
[2:27:45] to bring the condemnation to you
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:12] that we have a high priest of our
[2:28:15] confession
[2:28:17] is
[2:28:22] black offered for your conditions

[2:29:22] he's pushing you into it
[2:29:25] except you're right
[2:29:28] accept your sins
[2:29:33] to come and live his life away in your
[2:29:37] life
[2:29:39] foreign
[2:30:07] Romans 4 25 says who
[2:30:11] they live but for our offenses
[2:30:16] and he was raised again for our
[2:30:18] justifications
[2:30:23] so his resurrection
[2:30:26] is your righteous that's what the Holy
[2:30:31] Spirit
[2:30:32] convicts the believer
[2:30:35] accept your righteousness
[2:30:38] let the holy spirit

[2:30:48] with the blood of sacrifice
[2:30:51] he was doing it for himself
