[29:07] this morning
[29:09] the house of worship
[29:11] the house of correction coming to his
[29:14] presence just our fellowship one with
[29:17] another
[29:19] amen as the Lord speaks to us this
[29:22] morning
[29:23] amen amen I know one thing
[29:27] he says
[29:30] you know he's the same yesterday today
[29:32] and forever
[29:35] what he did in the Bible days
[29:40] he's able to do now
[29:44] [Music]
[29:48] of the goodness of the Lord
[29:51] amen the Lord is so good
[29:55] amen he turns sorrow to Joy I choose
[30:00] it's a joy listening to a testimony
[30:05] but then it's really stressing when you
[30:09] are coming through
[30:13] to produce a testimony
[30:16] I've got my two grandkids I don't know
[30:19] where they are
[30:21] hey man I want you to look at them
[30:24] that's uh
[30:26] summer and
[30:29] Rule
[30:31] [Music]
[30:33] and Rima amen you see back home I call
[30:38] about five names before I can come to
[30:40] the right one
[30:41] yeah
[30:45] they are out in the Sunday school they
[30:48] are going to come a little bit
[30:50] but you know what happened
[30:53] is that
[30:56] what was that Mom was it Wednesday
[30:59] Tuesday
[31:00] it was Tuesday night
[31:04] and you see we who stay in the
[31:08] countryside
[31:13] you see we do a few things
[31:36] [Music]
[31:48] and it was
[31:51] you know
[31:52] necessary that they get fumigated
[31:58] and so we did that
[32:01] but there were two options
[32:06] the young man who works on the farm
[32:12] wanted to use
[32:14] the medicine we use on ticks
[32:20] and then my wife said no that's
[32:22] expensive
[32:26] paraffin can do the job
[32:29] we normally buy paraffin
[32:32] and keep it in the house
[32:36] because these kids use Pampers
[32:41] and they cannot get
[32:44] you know rotten I take dope you have to
[32:48] kind of set them on fire
[32:51] so then my wife gave him some paraffin
[32:57] that he was going to use on those uh red
[33:01] ants
[33:04] and then this younger man with your
[33:07] movocon around seven o'clock in the
[33:10] night
[33:11] just put the bottle by the door
[33:16] to go and get a pump
[33:19] and these two little kids were there let
[33:22] me let the people see them
[33:26] amen amen so you know whatever they do
[33:30] they do in unison
[33:34] if you give one something to eat
[33:37] he's going to share it with another
[33:40] and so they went for the boat of
[33:44] paraffin now foreign
[33:52] [Music]
[33:59] [Music]
[34:13] [Music]
[34:30] [Music]
[34:48] [Music]
[34:53] [Music]
[35:02] so there was a lot of panicking the
[35:06] house
[35:12] you know and when we got on the main
[35:15] road
[35:16] it was seven o'clock
[35:18] and the roads were jammed
[35:23] I had to resort to hooting
[35:27] and got the wrong side of the road
[35:31] the people are so selfish
[35:35] they couldn't ask why this man is doing
[35:39] this
[35:41] [Music]
[35:43] so I had to transfer between Vehicles
[35:48] sometimes less than a foot this one less
[35:51] than a foot to the other side
[35:55] we came to a time when Faith couldn't
[35:57] hold us
[36:01] because she was literally dying
[36:04] she screamed she's dying she's dying
[36:10] [Music]
[36:20] foreign
[36:23] [Music]
[36:38] [Music]
[36:53] [Music]
[37:00] [Music]
[37:16] [Music]
[37:19] and then they were not
[37:34] [Music]
[37:43] so immediately they were pressed on
[37:46] uh oxygen man we know about it and the
[37:51] one that was in the most terrible
[37:52] condition was Rima yes
[37:56] and then stayed on oxygen I think for
[37:59] about 20 hours or something
[38:02] to bring them back to life
[38:05] and we thank God that a day before
[38:09] yesterday
[38:12] they finished their treatment
[38:15] so after about 24 hours
[38:18] those kids were singing Jesus loves me
[38:25] [Applause]
[38:27] and so I stand here to praise God
[38:31] it wouldn't be Joy this morning
[38:36] if the Lord didn't stand with us
[38:39] it would not be judged so we really
[38:42] certainly thank God
[38:44] the god of Miracles the same yesterday
[38:48] today and forever
[38:51] amen amen
[38:52] somebody wrote a song
[38:55] amen
[39:11] the doctor said if
[39:14] they had mixed The Tick Poise
[39:20] there would be no chance there
[39:24] ought to be no chance
[39:26] don't you give thanks to God
[39:30] that's what the boy needed
[39:32] [Applause]
[39:34] but my wife gave something else
[39:42] he couldn't accomplish what he wanted
[39:46] so to God we give the glory
[39:50] amen amen
[39:53] so this morning
[39:54] uh brother James is going to minister
[39:58] but before we do
[40:01] sister Faith is going to give us a song
[40:05] Here
[40:06] of course thanking God for saving our
[40:09] daughter
[40:11] amen amen
[40:15] God is so good
[40:18] amen you can never measure his goodness
[40:22] amen amen you can't you know put it in
[40:26] some form of quantity
[40:28] this is the match that God is good
[40:33] amen Amina God bless you what is the
[40:37] faith as we're going to the Rapture
[40:39] Ready
[40:41] amen so we should always give thanks to
[40:45] God

[40:50] and I give thanks to God
[40:53] for your prayers I'm sorry uh for the
[40:57] way I sent the message
