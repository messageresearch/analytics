[23:41] amen father we want to thank

[23:50] Sister father I pray that may grant our
[23:53] traveling
[23:56] mes we also thank you heavenly

[24:13] successful stay together in
[24:18] marriage we also want to commit this
[24:21] service into your
[24:23] hands father and as we go into reading
[24:26] the word
[24:29] we pray that you may anoint it in a
[24:31] special
[24:32] way in Jesus
[24:35] name
[24:37] amen so we shall go to John chapter
[24:43] 1 and verse
[24:46] 14 teaching is very
[24:49] important preaching is
[24:53] wonderful and you can put the church on
[24:56] fire
[24:59] they can claim their
[25:02] promises but better of holding those
[25:06] promises better off holding those
[25:10] promises when you are founded anchored
[25:13] in
[25:15] Jehovah amen John
[25:18] [Music]
[25:19] 114 and the Word was made
[25:25] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[25:28] and we beheld his
[25:30] glory the Glorious of the only begotten
[25:33] of the
[25:37] father full of grace and
[25:40] truth may the Lord blessing the reading
[25:43] of his
[25:45] word you may be
[25:48] seated so today we are dealing with
[25:51] preaching
[25:55] stability part two
[25:58] and I want to call the service
[26:02] today the
[26:04] word was made
[26:07] flesh amen many times when we talk about
[26:11] the word made
[26:15] flesh we sometimes look so much on
[26:20] Christ but then we
[26:22] forget that the word was also made
[26:27] flesh in the bride and that's where my
[26:30] standing is going to be this
[26:33] morning so I beg to build a
[26:38] foundation to fully establish the word
[26:43] becoming
[26:45] flesh amen so I'll go to the Book of
[26:49] Genesis with
[26:51] you and then I'll take chapter two
[26:58] and out of the ground made the Lord go
[27:02] to grow every tree that's Pleasant to
[27:05] the sight and good for food the tree of
[27:09] life also in the midst of the garden and
[27:13] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[27:31] amen so in this
[27:33] scripture we see our categories I mean
[27:37] we see four
[27:39] categories four
[27:41] categories of
[27:44] trees in the Garden of
[27:47] Eden there were the trees Pleasant to
[27:49] the
[27:51] site you can talk about the flower trees
[27:54] whatsoever
[27:56] there and then you can talk about the
[27:58] trees good for
[28:01] food so you can be talking about fruit
[28:05] trees and then there was another set of
[28:09] trees that stood in the middle of the
[28:13] garden the tree of life and the tree of
[28:17] knowledge of Good and
[28:19] Evil those are two other sets of trees
[28:24] there so we want to concentrate on these
[28:27] two trees
[28:29] that stood in the middle of the
[28:31] garden the tree of life and the tree of
[28:35] knowledge of Good and
[28:38] Evil amen because when Satan
[28:41] fell he retained what he
[28:46] knew so Satan has
[28:49] knowledge amen but at the same time he
[28:53] is
[28:56] evil that's the opposite of the tree of
[29:00] life and the Tree of Life Is Christ
[29:04] himself so the seven Church edge
[29:08] book it pours more light on those two
[29:12] trees uh which light we would
[29:17] put amen before
[29:19] us Amen to understand the importance of
[29:23] Revelation and discernment
[29:28] so I want you to be stud students this
[29:32] morning because we are laying another
[29:36] Foundation you know we've been here for
[29:38] so many
[29:40] years but then we also have so many
[29:43] other
[29:56] people so here in the Ephesian
[30:01] churches he says
[30:03] religion and spiritual
[30:06] world are made of two
[30:08] trees which had their roots in
[30:12] Eden both the tree of
[30:15] life and the tree of knowledge of Good
[30:18] and
[30:19] Evil stood in the midst of the
[30:23] garden and no doubt they very branches
[30:27] inter
[30:28] each
[30:31] other thus in Ephesian
[30:35] church is the same
[30:37] [Music]
[30:41] Paradox are you together with me so we
[30:45] need to understand here that the trees
[30:49] that were good for
[30:51] food was not one
[30:53] tree and then the trees Pleasant decide
[30:58] was not one tree but in the midst of the
[31:02] garden there were two independent
[31:05] trees the tree of life which is Christ
[31:10] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[31:13] Evil and that was Lucifer he retained
[31:17] the knowledge of
[31:18] good but he insisted in
[31:21] iniquity amen which makes him evil the
[31:25] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[31:28] but then we've been told the same
[31:30] Paradox stands in the Ephesian
[31:35] churches meaning that since it has had
[31:38] its
[31:41] seeds right here in
[31:44] Ephesus amen this Tre is going to keep
[31:47] carrying
[31:49] on all this principle is going to keep
[31:54] carrying amen they were in the midst of
[31:57] the garden
[31:59] and now again in Ephesus that's the same
[32:03] thing so these trees have been again
[32:06] planted into the church
[32:10] world that's why the prophet
[32:13] says religion and the spirit
[32:17] world are made up of those two
[32:20] trees which had their roots in
[32:23] Ed so I'll show you something here that
[32:28] one tree is
[32:29] Christ and the other tree is the
[32:32] Antichrist in first John chapter
[32:36] 4 and verse three John is trying to warn
[32:40] the
[32:42] Believers he says and every tree I mean
[32:45] every spirit that confesses not that
[32:48] Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh is
[32:51] not of
[32:52] God first first John 43
[33:06] and every
[33:08] spirit that confesses not that Jesus
[33:13] Christ is coming the flesh is not of God
[33:30] are you together with me because it was
[33:33] Christ in
[33:35] eternity he was made
[33:37] flesh are you together with me in the
[33:41] Lord Jesus Christ the word was made
[33:45] flesh and the same word must be made
[33:48] flesh in
[33:50] the it must be Christ in
[33:54] you and if a person comes to church
[33:58] but is not
[34:00] confessing that Christ is alive in his
[34:04] life by the manifestation of his
[34:08] works this is what John is pointing
[34:11] to amen are you together with me so we
[34:15] read it again and every
[34:19] spirit that confesses
[34:22] not that Jesus Christ is coming in the
[34:25] flesh is not of God
[34:28] and this is the spirit of
[34:33] antichrist whereof he had that it should
[34:38] come and even now already is in the
[34:44] world so we shall always have those two
[34:48] trees even in every local
[34:51] church we shall always have those two
[34:54] trees amen are you together with me
[34:58] so one must come to a
[35:02] point where he can point to Christ
[35:05] taking over his
[35:07] life amen so the spirit of the
[35:11] Antichrist has always been
[35:14] around right from the Garden of Eden
[35:17] when Christ came into
[35:19] manifestation Judas came into
[35:22] manifestation when Christ was hanged on
[35:24] the cross Judas went and hanged on the
[35:28] tree and that same Spirit was
[35:31] released and came down on the door
[35:34] Pentecost
[35:36] also when the spirit of God came down
[35:40] into body on the day of Pentecost even
[35:44] the spirit of the
[35:45] Antichrist came right down there on the
[35:47] day of pente and that's what John is
[35:50] pointing to and he says now he already
[35:54] in the
[35:55] world are you together with me
[35:58] amen that's the spirit that was mocking
[36:02] the
[36:03] people on the day of pent and saying
[36:07] they are drunk on
[36:09] you are you together with me so this
[36:12] Spirit
[36:14] later amen adopted the
[36:18] name of Jesus Christ in religious
[36:24] worship but their confession of Christ
[36:29] does not come from the
[36:31] heart or El the
[36:34] confession would positively affect the
[36:37] character to a good
[36:41] fruit are you together with me so they
[36:44] adopt the
[36:45] name also in
[36:48] worship they use the very word you
[36:52] use but the difference is when the word
[36:56] is made flesh
[36:58] are you together with me will you be the
[37:01] word made flesh the Holy Spirit
[37:04] controlling your life guiding your
[37:07] works that is what I'm talking about
[37:10] this
[37:11] morning so in the Garden of Eden these
[37:15] two trees were so
[37:18] intertwined listen now that if needed
[37:23] revelation of what she would involve
[37:26] herself into
[37:28] but
[37:29] unfortunately Adam was not in
[37:33] range to give her the spiritual
[37:37] understanding especially when you know
[37:40] it is so hard that this thing you know
[37:50] intertwin I'm trying to come to you this
[37:53] morning amen the prophet says the ch is
[37:58] made up of good and
[38:03] bad two Vines make the
[38:06] church they are like wheat and tears in
[38:09] the same
[38:11] garden growing up side by
[38:15] side but one is
[38:17] true and the other is false now God will
[38:23] speak to each
[38:25] one and will talk about each
[38:30] one amen so when these two are in the
[38:34] same
[38:36] Garden he speaks to both of
[38:40] them and speaks about both of
[38:45] them amen are you together with me
[38:50] so he
[38:52] will call them the church
[38:59] those two
[39:01] together he call them the
[39:04] church so we are looking at the
[39:08] principle of the two trees in the middle
[39:11] of the
[39:13] garden and the same principle keeps
[39:15] going
[39:17] on when Jesus came Judas came to keep
[39:22] the
[39:23] principle when Jesus died Judas died
[39:28] to keep the principle when the Holy
[39:30] Ghost came the spirit of the Antichrist
[39:33] came to keep the princip and he says he
[39:37] call both of them the
[39:40] church and only the
[39:42] elect we really
[39:44] know which is the true
[39:48] Spirit only the
[39:50] elect will not be
[39:55] deceived amen so that's what we have in
[39:58] church
[40:00] again and we need
[40:03] Revelation as we seek to feed on the
[40:06] tree of
[40:08] life that's why
[40:10] church is built on
[40:13] Revelation and to an
[40:15] extent discernment of
[40:20] spirits when we fail in those two
[40:24] areas then there cannot be stability
[40:28] in the local
[40:30] church amen so brother Bram says now
[40:35] remember this Christ in the true church
[40:40] is the continuation of the book of
[40:44] Acts are you together with me so Christ
[40:48] the true
[40:50] church is the
[40:54] continuation so the church I mean the
[40:56] book of of
[40:58] Acts is not over because the book of
[41:03] Acts is the Holy Ghost in
[41:06] church it's actually not the book of
[41:09] Acts of the
[41:11] Apostles but it's the book of Acts of
[41:13] the Holy Ghost in the
[41:16] church so he's a continuation of the
[41:20] book of
[41:23] Acts not a repeat
[41:27] the history of the Acts of the
[41:30] Apostles so this means that the book of
[41:34] Acts is an unfolding
[41:37] book through the seven
[41:41] churches Ephesus itself as a
[41:45] chapter to you know this book we can
[41:50] call it a chapter we can call it a
[41:53] chapter amen we can call some minor
[41:56] chapter
[41:59] amen we call
[42:02] chapter because the book is
[42:05] one amen and now the holy ghost in the
[42:10] church is the continuation of that book
[42:13] of
[42:15] Acts amen it is Christ walking through
[42:19] the seven Garden
[42:22] kind it's a church that has been tested
[42:26] and proved
[42:29] amen it is one
[42:32] V but with seven
[42:35] branches all that
[42:38] edges they are just branches of that
[42:43] vine I put a quote to
[42:46] this the prophet in the message
[42:48] believest thou
[42:51] this amen he
[42:54] says I am the Vine
[42:57] quoting
[42:59] Jesus you are the
[43:02] branches well now if that
[43:05] vine put forth the first
[43:10] branch and out of that Branch wrote a
[43:13] book of
[43:15] Acts the second Branch will make another
[43:18] book of
[43:24] Acts the second branch
[43:28] the second Branch will make another book
[43:30] of
[43:32] Acts the third branch will make another
[43:35] book of
[43:36] Acts and never branch that comes out of
[43:40] that
[43:42] vine will be the same as the first
[43:45] Branch
[43:47] was different
[43:50] branches but the life is
[43:53] one and that's the life of the Holy
[43:56] Ghost
[43:58] it was the life in the first
[44:01] church and all the churches that were in
[44:04] the first
[44:06] chur and we still have the same life
[44:10] today that flows through all the
[44:15] Believers and as long as it's the same
[44:18] life has bear the acts of the book of
[44:21] the
[44:23] Apostles this is the principles of
[44:25] Hebrews 138
[44:30] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[44:33] and
[44:35] forever continually unfolding his
[44:39] character amen it is Christ releasing
[44:43] the revelation of
[44:46] himself amen upon which the church is
[44:51] built amen I'll give you a few quotes
[44:55] today we go to the revelation of Jesus
[44:59] Christ he says
[45:03] he meaning
[45:05] Satan knows that if the people get the
[45:09] true
[45:11] Revelation listen here of the true
[45:15] church and what she
[45:18] is and what she stands
[45:21] for and that she can do the Greater
[45:24] Works
[45:27] she the church will be an invisible
[45:33] Army are you together with me that is
[45:37] worth somebody saying
[45:39] amen now this church is not our local
[45:45] church because somebody might say yes
[45:48] I've got a revelation of the true
[45:51] church it is our local church no it's
[45:55] not talking about the local church
[45:57] you must take a note of that the church
[46:01] is talking about is the invisible
[46:05] body built upon the revelation of
[46:10] Christ that's the church that the devil
[46:13] cannot bring
[46:15] down amen and this
[46:18] Revelation that I'm talking about is not
[46:22] the understanding of the godhead
[46:28] is Christ revealing
[46:31] himself in living
[46:34] reality in the different
[46:37] individuals that's Christ coming in the
[46:40] flesh
[46:42] again are you together with me so we
[46:46] want to understand a few
[46:49] things upon which we can
[46:51] build and establish stability as a local
[46:55] church
[46:59] amen this
[47:01] revelation will be Christ in
[47:04] youing living
[47:07] fruit in living I mean in the
[47:10] season so this Christ in
[47:13] you Amen in this bright
[47:17] age cannot bear
[47:20] fruit of Luther's
[47:22] age it must be the fruit of this age
[47:27] that's the Revelation I am speaking
[47:29] of that's the Revelation upon
[47:32] which the church is
[47:37] buil amen so I go and you are going to
[47:41] pick the concept as we keep
[47:44] going so the
[47:46] Revelation is not
[47:50] Doctrine but a living
[47:54] presence of the living Christ
[47:59] until we see
[48:00] him in our
[48:02] [Music]
[48:05] lives th
[48:07] Christ in flesh
[48:10] again the word made
[48:14] flesh amen that's why Paul says you are
[48:18] a written
[48:20] EP that must have
[48:24] life amen that's why he says greater
[48:29] than Solomon is
[48:31] here but expressed in your
[48:34] life who is
[48:36] this not the
[48:42] historic embed in the present
[48:46] tense in your life the Prince of
[48:50] Peace amen the prince of
[48:53] righteousness amen has put on another
[48:56] body
[48:58] not the body of Jesus that was hunged on
[49:01] the cross but you becoming the body of
[49:05] Christ
[49:09] again know ye not that you are the body
[49:12] of
[49:13] Christ and that you are members of that
[49:16] body in
[49:19] particular so we worship The everpresent
[49:24] God Who identifies himself in the
[49:27] present
[49:29] test when he met Moses he did not say I
[49:33] was the god of thy
[49:37] father he told Moses I am the god of thy
[49:43] father the god of Abraham the god of
[49:47] Isaac and the god of
[49:49] Jacob is that amen not I was all the
[49:54] time he is founded on Hebrews
[50:00] 138 and that's what the theme of brother
[50:03] bram's
[50:08] Ministry Jesus Christ the same
[50:13] yesterday is not I will be is not I was
[50:18] but he told Moses I am that I
[50:22] am amen so Christ revealed in SE
[50:29] will not only be the revelation of the
[50:32] person of
[50:34] Christ but it will also be the
[50:38] revelation of his Future
[50:41] Works in the coming seven Church
[50:45] ages that's the book of
[50:49] Acts you see people think they in the
[50:53] message simply because they can explain
[50:56] the godhead
[50:59] what puts you in the
[51:01] Mery is when you are living in the
[51:05] present tense with Jesus
[51:10] Christ you don't know him by
[51:15] history but you know him because he
[51:18] lives on the side
[51:20] of you are the word made flesh again you
[51:24] are written a p
[51:26] R of all
[51:27] men working
[51:30] gospel that's a great
[51:33] Foundation amen thus the book of Acts
[51:38] must be the same
[51:39] life running through the seven
[51:43] branches his fruit in every
[51:48] season amen the revelation of
[51:52] Christ through the seven churches
[51:57] was relevant to the
[52:01] season as I told you that in every local
[52:05] church God hides in the weaknesses of
[52:09] the
[52:10] people because that's where you need
[52:13] your
[52:14] help is not in the strong
[52:17] areas but in the weak
[52:20] areas that's where God hides and then
[52:24] unfolds himself
[52:27] and then you can say this
[52:30] day this scripture is
[52:32] fulfilled because you have seen
[52:36] something which Humanity cannot
[52:40] produce the superatural
[52:43] wants to from our
[52:47] weakness amen he wants to from our
[52:53] needs in the days of Abraham
[52:56] when he was taking his son to go and
[52:59] sacrifice him that was the area of
[53:02] Abraham's
[53:05] need amen and then God comes down to
[53:10] bring down a
[53:11] lamb then Abraham says that's
[53:17] Jehovah go to the local church will
[53:21] always hide in the wickedness of the
[53:24] people
[53:26] and reveal
[53:28] himself day by day by making the people
[53:32] become
[53:34] Overcomers then you start going from
[53:38] glory to glory to glory until you stand
[53:43] in glory
[53:46] himself
[53:48] amen so now the
[53:52] Revelation was always intended to bring
[53:55] his life
[53:57] even in the local
[53:59] churches amen the message we have now
[54:04] could not come in the time of
[54:07] Ephesus the founding of the
[54:09] church it would be
[54:14] relevant are you together with me he
[54:17] reveals
[54:19] himself with our
[54:24] need you tell me I have a weak
[54:28] Pastor that's where you are going to
[54:30] find
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:34] God that's where you're going to find
[54:37] it just keep your ear to the
[54:41] ground he's going to say
[54:45] something God will always be
[54:50] relevant to the need of the
[54:53] edge to the need of a local church
[54:57] as he will be
[54:59] relevant to the need of every individual
[55:04] believer amen your need is
[55:07] different and then he comes before you
[55:11] and he says I'm
[55:14] Jehovah you are not sick that is not
[55:18] helping you we serve a God who is
[55:21] relevant to the needs of his church
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:29] you see what I mean so nobody will
[55:32] import his
[55:34] Doctrine and then dump it on you because
[55:39] sometimes that's not your area
[55:42] of amen God will not just come and
[55:47] testify to you that I am a God who keeps
[55:51] the families
[55:53] together the problem is not that because
[55:56] you are in good union with your
[55:59] wife you want to see God in another area
[56:04] because you've got a sick child you want
[56:07] to see Jehovah
[56:11] RAF God is
[56:16] [Music]
[56:17] always amen so now his true
[56:23] Revelation brings forth the L relevant
[56:27] to the
[56:29] age and the same is
[56:32] true the same is all so
[56:35] true that the true revelation of Christ
[56:38] to
[56:39] you will bring forth life relevant to
[56:43] your position in the
[56:49] body amen yeah you cannot bear my
[56:54] fruit you have your own position in the
[56:58] body you are also a branch to that
[57:01] body so you must bear some
[57:08] fruit praise the
[57:10] Lord okay uh let's go down to Psalms
[57:14] chapter
[57:18] 1 and then verse
[57:21] three he says
[57:24] here and he
[57:26] shall be like a tree planted by the
[57:29] rivers of
[57:33] water whom is David talking
[57:36] about David is talking about
[57:39] you listen to what David say you shall
[57:44] be like a
[57:46] tree thus planted By the
[57:50] Waters and that tree brings forth his
[57:54] fruit not another man
[57:57] fruit but bring forth his
[58:00] fruit in his
[58:02] season his leave also shall not
[58:08] wer
[58:10] andever shall
[58:13] prosper Hallelujah his
[58:16] fruit in his
[58:18] season sometimes your season is the need
[58:23] of temperance
[58:27] that's the fruit you are going to
[58:30] Bear you not talking about the fruit of
[58:35] Faith because that's not your area
[58:40] of a tree planted by the rivers of
[58:45] water be every whole
[58:50] fruit but in his season
[58:57] are you together with me and that's the
[58:59] same way God
[59:01] works with the
[59:03] churches and with the local
[59:07] church he
[59:09] knows what we have need of
[59:12] here amen now every
[59:17] messenger brought forth Divine
[59:21] fruit for his
[59:23] age just like you should also bear
[59:26] Divine
[59:28] fruit which is
[59:30] relevant to the
[59:33] calling of God in your
[59:37] life amen you don't go down kneeling and
[59:44] praying God give me a message
[59:47] today God speak to
[59:50] me and you are not a
[59:55] pastor you are telling God to give you
[59:59] something to
[1:00:01] preach you see you are not being
[1:00:05] relevant but when you are a song
[1:00:08] leader you don't go to God and start
[1:00:12] saying
[1:00:13] God today I pray that you may give me a
[1:00:17] great
[1:00:18] message you ask God to help you to get
[1:00:23] into the mind
[1:00:26] of God for the
[1:00:28] service so that whatever song you come
[1:00:30] up with is relevant with the moving of
[1:00:34] the Holy
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:38] Spirit bearing
[1:00:40] fruit in your season is the evidence of
[1:00:44] the presence of
[1:00:46] Christ that you are planted by the
[1:00:48] rivers of
[1:00:51] water amen listen to what brother Bram
[1:00:54] says about you this
[1:00:58] morning as a tree planted by the rivers
[1:01:02] of
[1:01:03] water out of you shall flow rivers of
[1:01:06] Liv
[1:01:08] water amen those Rivers will keep going
[1:01:11] to your
[1:01:14] branches to bring to
[1:01:16] fruit your
[1:01:20] fruit not another man's fruit but your
[1:01:24] fruit
[1:01:27] sometimes we are so
[1:01:29] concerned about somebody else than
[1:01:34] ourselves it's a very big
[1:01:36] mistake you go back
[1:01:41] home did you hear that did you hear that
[1:01:46] no you feed
[1:01:50] yourself and come to a
[1:01:52] level of bearing good fruit
[1:01:58] we should come to church as
[1:02:01] individuals because we are not
[1:02:04] Jews Jews are called out as a
[1:02:07] nation but for us it's individual
[1:02:11] calling so I am the Church of Christ
[1:02:17] which comes together with you to have
[1:02:22] [Applause]
[1:02:24] Fellowship listen
[1:02:27] he shall bring forth his fruit in his
[1:02:36] season it
[1:02:41] his the personal pronoun
[1:02:45] there it is his
[1:02:49] fruit meaning God's
[1:02:52] fruit in the
[1:02:54] season that the Prophet is bringing it
[1:02:58] hallelujah hallelujah a prophet brings
[1:03:02] God's
[1:03:03] fruit in God
[1:03:06] season for the
[1:03:09] people so he comes and says it will be
[1:03:14] in the prophet
[1:03:16] season God's
[1:03:19] fruit In God's Time by The Prophet
[1:03:24] season is it the season of
[1:03:27] Lu is it the season of
[1:03:30] Wesley is it the season of
[1:03:32] Mal he brings God's
[1:03:36] fruit for the season when he
[1:03:40] comes as a messenger to the
[1:03:45] people he says he shall bring for his
[1:03:51] season his
[1:03:53] fruit in his season see if there isn't
[1:03:57] two he
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:01] there bring forth
[1:04:03] his God's
[1:04:05] fruit in the season that the messenger
[1:04:09] is ordained to
[1:04:14] come he bring forth
[1:04:17] those are you together with me and it's
[1:04:20] exactly the same
[1:04:22] way God works with the local church
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:29] when a pastor comes forth a minister
[1:04:33] comes forth is bringing God's
[1:04:37] fruit in God's season in the season that
[1:04:41] he
[1:04:44] come
[1:04:46] so God is speaking to you this
[1:04:51] morning
[1:04:53] amen bring forth his God's fruit
[1:04:57] in the season that the messenger Ed to
[1:05:01] come now remember that the messenger
[1:05:05] that brings the fruit of
[1:05:08] God will bring it in God's
[1:05:13] seon in the season of the
[1:05:19] bringer he bring forth his fruit in his
[1:05:22] season
[1:05:26] and it cannot
[1:05:30] wither are you together with me when he
[1:05:34] brings
[1:05:35] forth that fruit it cannot
[1:05:40] wither it has eternal
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:45] life amen it has eternal
[1:05:49] life amen he says it's got predestinated
[1:05:53] fruit in there
[1:05:56] it cannot destroy it because it's
[1:06:00] predestinated so the fruit it cannot
[1:06:03] wither it's
[1:06:06] Eternal and I am preaching stability
[1:06:10] today God ordained
[1:06:13] ministry will always plow a straight
[1:06:18] line amen and will always be in
[1:06:22] season and if you stand as an individual
[1:06:26] and catch
[1:06:28] Revelation and you take that fruit as
[1:06:31] your fruit it will not with
[1:06:37] us because it has come in
[1:06:40] season amen the prophet again
[1:06:44] says in Revelation of Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ he says if they get a true
[1:06:53] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah of the
[1:06:56] two
[1:06:57] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:06:59] Christian
[1:07:04] church and by God's
[1:07:07] spirit
[1:07:09] discern and
[1:07:11] with the Antichrist
[1:07:14] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:07:20] her amen that's where Eve failed
[1:07:25] in
[1:07:27] discernment what is the right
[1:07:33] tree she had the intellectual
[1:07:36] understanding of
[1:07:39] it but she didn't have
[1:07:42] Revelation amen so
[1:07:46] friends it has to be both Revelation and
[1:07:53] discernment because the two
[1:07:56] are
[1:07:58] interwin it is two spirits in the
[1:08:03] framework of the Christian
[1:08:06] churcham and the
[1:08:08] serpent Christ and the
[1:08:10] Antichrist two trees in the same
[1:08:17] form no brother Bram preached the
[1:08:22] message three kinds of believers
[1:08:26] in every local
[1:08:28] church God give me Grace To Be A True
[1:08:36] Believer to be a True
[1:08:39] Believer we need Revelation and
[1:08:43] discernment because both these
[1:08:46] Spirits have come
[1:08:50] through W's door of reformation
[1:08:57] and both these
[1:08:58] trees they populate
[1:09:01] themselves with
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:06] fruit are you together with me they
[1:09:09] populate
[1:09:12] themselves so and this is the
[1:09:15] condition in every local
[1:09:18] church and that's why the Gentile
[1:09:22] church is an individual
[1:09:27] buil on the
[1:09:30] revelation of Jesus
[1:09:34] Christ Israel is called out as a
[1:09:38] nation they go into this passion as a
[1:09:43] nation and now they end up Inon as a
[1:09:48] nation again redeemed from Babylon as a
[1:09:51] nation
[1:09:55] going dispersion as a
[1:09:59] nation again now
[1:10:02] 1948 in the Feast of
[1:10:05] trumpet the sixth
[1:10:07] trumpet amen they are called back again
[1:10:10] as a
[1:10:12] nation but they are still
[1:10:15] blind amen when the bride is taken
[1:10:19] away again their eyes will be open as a
[1:10:23] nation
[1:10:25] for you it is an
[1:10:27] individual built on the revelation of
[1:10:30] Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ are you together with me so this
[1:10:39] is the
[1:10:40] condition in every local
[1:10:42] church that's why we must stand as
[1:10:48] individuals a church built on the
[1:10:51] principle of spirit and life
[1:10:55] not only
[1:10:57] Doctrine amen because it says the words
[1:11:00] which I speak unto
[1:11:03] you are spirit and life meaning that if
[1:11:08] it's the
[1:11:14] word it must bring forth
[1:11:18] fruit is that Amen Let there be light if
[1:11:23] there was no light
[1:11:25] that's not God's word the word brings
[1:11:29] forth
[1:11:30] life and once you listen to the word and
[1:11:34] you take it in faith it bear
[1:11:37] fruit for it to be the
[1:11:40] word amen so they must bear
[1:11:43] manifestation of
[1:11:46] Christ in their individual
[1:11:49] life you just say Lord make me a
[1:11:53] fruitful tree
[1:11:58] amen Revelation
[1:12:01] 38 he says I Know Thy
[1:12:06] Works God is not
[1:12:09] ignorant behold I have set before thee
[1:12:12] an open
[1:12:15] door and no man can shut
[1:12:20] it for thou a little strength
[1:12:26] you cannot keep the door open on your
[1:12:30] own but I have set
[1:12:35] before and has kept my
[1:12:39] word and not denied my
[1:12:43] name the word and the name kept the the
[1:12:49] door
[1:12:51] open we have a little
[1:12:53] strength but when whenever the word
[1:12:56] comes Lord help me to take
[1:12:59] it amen let me maintain the
[1:13:03] name which is the character of
[1:13:06] Christ it keeps the door
[1:13:11] open are you together with me but while
[1:13:15] the door was
[1:13:17] open again the other
[1:13:20] tree which was in
[1:13:23] Ephesus came through this door
[1:13:29] that's how terrible it is so we are
[1:13:32] going to use this scripture
[1:13:35] here to understand the two
[1:13:38] doors the door of
[1:13:42] reformation which brought
[1:13:45] back amen which was bringing back the
[1:13:50] church from the de ages
[1:13:55] of
[1:13:57] reformation God kept it
[1:13:59] open and the enemy sneaked through that
[1:14:06] door are you together with me but when
[1:14:10] you know here again here we are both the
[1:14:15] tree of
[1:14:19] life and the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:14:21] and
[1:14:23] Evil still intertwin
[1:14:27] but God in his
[1:14:29] wisdom he put another
[1:14:32] door and this door here is for the
[1:14:37] individual behold I stand at the
[1:14:40] door and knock If any man hear my
[1:14:45] voice the
[1:14:47] individual com to me I eat with him and
[1:14:52] he with me then he stands in that door
[1:14:56] the door of the bridge and he says come
[1:14:59] up
[1:14:59] here he calling an
[1:15:02] individual is calling you
[1:15:07] today come
[1:15:09] up and through that door the tree of
[1:15:14] knowledge and
[1:15:16] evil cannot go through that's the
[1:15:23] breach praise the Lord
[1:15:25] so once we catch
[1:15:29] this then we are standing first to First
[1:15:34] with
[1:15:38] stability when you
[1:15:40] realize this door here I go through it
[1:15:44] as an
[1:15:46] individual that is
[1:15:50] stability praying
[1:15:52] Lord I understand the principle
[1:15:56] how you work with the
[1:15:58] Gentiles you need my
[1:16:01] soul
[1:16:05] father amen okay listen to brother Bram
[1:16:10] here in order to understand the wealth
[1:16:13] meaning the wealth of
[1:16:19] meaning involved in behold I set before
[1:16:22] you an Open Door
[1:16:30] and no
[1:16:33] can we must now
[1:16:36] recall what has been
[1:16:39] said about each
[1:16:41] age running over into another
[1:16:46] age there is an
[1:16:49] overlapping meaning melting into Fading
[1:16:53] Into
[1:17:00] and not clear
[1:17:08] clear this
[1:17:10] age particularly flows into the next
[1:17:16] age let me show
[1:17:18] you when the church age is
[1:17:22] ending and this is another age
[1:17:26] the life of the old
[1:17:28] age begins to pep it the new
[1:17:34] age and then the new
[1:17:36] age also begins to
[1:17:40] peep into the old
[1:17:42] age until now
[1:17:46] afterwards a new AG starts
[1:17:49] out so let me tell you do you know what
[1:17:52] cometh next
[1:17:55] it's going to be the
[1:17:57] tribulation after the church is taken
[1:17:59] out of but all the
[1:18:04] seeds of the
[1:18:06] tribulation are here with
[1:18:10] us they are here with us in the
[1:18:14] tribulation we have got Jacob's
[1:18:19] trouble
[1:18:20] Israel going through their ping
[1:18:28] amen and right now look at what is
[1:18:33] happening every nation is throwing them
[1:18:37] away until they are
[1:18:40] Christ Hallelujah hallu we come
[1:18:44] down praise God
[1:18:48] so of the tribulation
[1:18:52] here that's the principle
[1:18:55] of how God
[1:18:58] works amen and then he says and not only
[1:19:02] does this age flow into the last
[1:19:08] age but this last
[1:19:10] age is in
[1:19:16] manys simply carrying of the
[1:19:27] the seventh age a very short age we have
[1:19:34] brother he always says this is a very
[1:19:36] short
[1:19:38] age and then he was always
[1:19:41] culated and he says big man I don't see
[1:19:45] the future he was ready he was
[1:19:50] right his mind had gone ahead of him
[1:19:56] and God took
[1:20:00] him but there are some of
[1:20:03] us
[1:20:05] TI into the things of this
[1:20:09] world that we don't even have enough
[1:20:12] time for
[1:20:16] God you see what I
[1:20:18] mean if you are going into the
[1:20:22] Rapture the seeds
[1:20:25] that
[1:20:28] excitement of the
[1:20:30] Rapture must speak on you
[1:20:34] now like the seeds of the
[1:20:37] tribulation have fallen on the
[1:20:44] Antichrist
[1:20:46] Lord anoint me with rupturing
[1:20:52] faith can we say Amen then
[1:20:56] okay the seventh age a very short
[1:21:00] age gathers up into one quick
[1:21:05] work all of the evil of every
[1:21:12] age and yet all the reality of
[1:21:18] Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has
[1:21:21] brought has about run its course
[1:21:27] the Lan Edge quickly comes
[1:21:30] in bringing
[1:21:32] forth both the
[1:21:35] tears and the
[1:21:37] wheat into the
[1:21:40] Harvest are you together with me we are
[1:21:43] in the
[1:21:47] harest the
[1:21:49] separation happens in the Lan churches
[1:21:56] that's where we
[1:21:58] are are you together with me so now I I
[1:22:03] want you to
[1:22:07] see let's go to MTH 13 Verse 30 you
[1:22:11] don't have to go continue with the
[1:22:13] quote because brother Bram just quotes
[1:22:16] that
[1:22:18] scripture he
[1:22:20] says first bind the tears to bur them
[1:22:33] first bind the ti to bur
[1:22:40] them
[1:22:42] but the
[1:22:44] whe into
[1:22:46] the are you together with me so there
[1:22:50] are two activities
[1:22:53] here the
[1:22:55] is the Gathering of the tears to burn
[1:23:00] them but gather the
[1:23:02] wheat into
[1:23:05] my so
[1:23:10] the are gathered here
[1:23:15] in but GA the wheat into my
[1:23:20] bur that's the next
[1:23:23] door which is the
[1:23:25] bridge where God is gathering
[1:23:29] you amen that's where he gathers the
[1:23:34] elect so the prophet continues to say
[1:23:38] remember please that the sadan
[1:23:44] age started the
[1:23:47] Reformation that must still go
[1:23:51] on until the grain that was planted at
[1:23:56] Pentecost go through the full cycle of
[1:24:01] planting
[1:24:03] watering and
[1:24:07] nishing until it comes right back to the
[1:24:10] original
[1:24:13] SE while this is going
[1:24:16] on that was s we have to go through that
[1:24:20] cycle
[1:24:24] we have
[1:24:26] a that's exactly what we see
[1:24:30] happening if you can just think of the
[1:24:37] Season what's the
[1:24:44] season you can get a very good picture
[1:24:47] of
[1:24:49] it the plant that you see growing
[1:24:55] in full
[1:24:57] strength in
[1:25:00] summer suddenly appears to be going to
[1:25:05] seed you can't tell exactly when summer
[1:25:11] become it just Fades into
[1:25:14] it that's how the edges
[1:25:18] are and espe two last ages
[1:25:24] amen so the PRP of those two
[1:25:28] trees in
[1:25:30] Ephesus they keep growing
[1:25:34] together this and that this and
[1:25:37] that and then when God opens the
[1:25:42] door of the
[1:25:44] Reformation to bring the church back
[1:25:48] from the fall
[1:25:50] of what
[1:25:52] happens even this
[1:25:54] Antichrist tree also comes
[1:25:59] through and it comes into the Lan
[1:26:04] church are you together with me but
[1:26:07] aren't you thankful to
[1:26:09] God that there is one door for
[1:26:13] you the door of the
[1:26:15] bridge hallelujah hallelujah only the
[1:26:18] elect will enter in
[1:26:21] there that's the door where says behold
[1:26:25] I stand at the door
[1:26:27] and and if any man hears my
[1:26:31] voice comes
[1:26:33] out an individual
[1:26:41] Foundation
[1:26:42] amen so we must be really watching as
[1:26:49] individuals this is where we are we are
[1:26:53] dealing with two different
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:56] seeds they come through the door of
[1:26:59] Wesley and they grow together with the
[1:27:02] right
[1:27:03] sea but then as I told
[1:27:06] you there is another door called the
[1:27:10] bridge the door that
[1:27:13] separates the wheat and the
[1:27:16] tears hallelujah
[1:27:19] hallelujah praise God but then this door
[1:27:24] is in itself a spiritual
[1:27:31] condition this door is a spiritual
[1:27:37] condition that none can get into
[1:27:41] it except the
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:45] SE th going back into the image of Jesus
[1:27:50] Christ the word made flesh
[1:27:57] written of all
[1:28:01] men praise the lord it's a spiritual
[1:28:05] condition and the true seed must go in
[1:28:09] past that
[1:28:10] door and in
[1:28:13] here is where we catch the divine
[1:28:18] revelation the divine revelation of who
[1:28:22] this Christ is
[1:28:25] because every age had to have his own
[1:28:29] Revelation relevant to the challenges of
[1:28:32] the
[1:28:34] age so this
[1:28:37] Revelation which we need in this
[1:28:40] age is the revelation of
[1:28:43] who and not the
[1:28:46] doctr of who he
[1:28:50] is
[1:28:51] okay so
[1:28:54] we are being built on the
[1:28:57] Rock The Rock of
[1:29:00] Revelation it must keep hanging over
[1:29:04] you praise the Lord you see Ephesus was
[1:29:09] the
[1:29:11] best and The Rock was there when it grew
[1:29:16] the rock also grew went up higher went
[1:29:19] up higher went up higher went up higher
[1:29:23] that's reation Christ was always over
[1:29:27] his church but right now he's coming to
[1:29:31] a
[1:29:33] point must come and
[1:29:37] see amen as the
[1:29:40] headone to the body of
[1:29:43] Believers so that he can transmit his
[1:29:48] will in this final
[1:29:52] Edge that's the revelation of Christ
[1:29:57] today is the revelation of Christ the
[1:30:01] person in fellowship with that
[1:30:06] individual not coming to church to show
[1:30:10] a
[1:30:11] presence but father make me
[1:30:16] better amen you listen to how brother
[1:30:19] Bram says it in the Blasphemous
[1:30:22] names he says and that's
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:28] been each Church age has had that rock
[1:30:34] confession all up to this rock
[1:30:37] confession of
[1:30:40] lodia so every age had the necessary
[1:30:45] identification of
[1:30:48] Christ that was relevant to
[1:30:52] them amen amen Revelation 2
[1:30:56] verse1 are you here do you love him amen
[1:31:02] we shall go slow and bring this
[1:31:05] down when what you miss just go back to
[1:31:09] the
[1:31:10] tape in your time and listen to it amen
[1:31:16] Revelation
[1:31:18] 21 we are talking about the word made
[1:31:22] flesh the revelation
[1:31:25] upon which Christ builds his
[1:31:30] church not on your knowledge of the
[1:31:34] godhead that's theological
[1:31:37] knowledge but Christ becoming
[1:31:43] flesh so Revelation
[1:31:47] 21 unto the
[1:31:50] angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:31:54] write these
[1:31:56] things says he that holds the Seven
[1:31:59] Stars in his right
[1:32:03] hand in the midst of the seven golden
[1:32:08] can the Revelation here to the Ed of
[1:32:13] Ephesus was the person of Jesus
[1:32:18] Christ that was walking in the church
[1:32:24] and as I said last time last week there
[1:32:28] was no pop with him there was no
[1:32:31] Cardinal with him there was no
[1:32:34] Archbishop there was no Bishop there
[1:32:37] there was no Pastor there it was Christ
[1:32:41] and the believer
[1:32:43] the being made
[1:32:48] flesh a personal
[1:32:52] relationship amen
[1:32:54] so he's telling them I hold the Seven
[1:32:57] Stars in the right
[1:32:59] hand I walk through the
[1:33:03] seven I am
[1:33:06] sov I
[1:33:09] require
[1:33:12] Preen in the second
[1:33:17] age verse
[1:33:19] 8 and un the end of the church in Sam
[1:33:28] these things says the first and the
[1:33:32] last which was dead and is
[1:33:37] alive so the Revelation
[1:33:40] here was the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:44] Christ who had the
[1:33:47] power toher
[1:33:50] life into people that were dead
[1:33:55] in sins and
[1:33:57] trespasses amen and he transformed I
[1:34:01] mean he he manifested
[1:34:03] it when he died and rose again so the
[1:34:08] Rock
[1:34:09] Box the rock
[1:34:13] box has always been over every Church
[1:34:18] AG it is always Christ in
[1:34:21] everye he comes up at the beginning of
[1:34:24] the
[1:34:25] church and he calls them to this
[1:34:27] revelation of who he
[1:34:30] is I am he that walks through the seven
[1:34:36] Goen and then he exactly does
[1:34:41] that amen so it's always the person of
[1:34:44] the Lord Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ in never Church age just working
[1:34:50] in that church age
[1:34:53] a certain
[1:34:55] way but at the end of the Lan Church
[1:35:00] age and before
[1:35:04] theum there is a
[1:35:09] gap that's called the
[1:35:11] bridge where the
[1:35:14] qu is gathered into a
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:21] presence put in the gers
[1:35:25] waiting for the second coming of
[1:35:28] Christ are you together with me have you
[1:35:32] been
[1:35:33] gathered have you been taken through the
[1:35:35] door of
[1:35:38] security has God separated
[1:35:41] you amen from the
[1:35:44] CH amen as God separated you from the te
[1:35:50] now this question here is not to the
[1:35:54] local church but it's to the
[1:35:59] individual God needs to deal with
[1:36:04] you as an
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:10] individual listen
[1:36:12] here brother Bram
[1:36:15] says the two vines that grew
[1:36:19] together and intertwin their
[1:36:22] branches and now to be
[1:36:29] separated they are to be
[1:36:32] separated you cannot have one foot in
[1:36:36] organization and one foot in the message
[1:36:40] he says they have to be
[1:36:42] separated we cannot stand the risk
[1:36:47] anymore like Eve stood in the
[1:36:50] risk which fruit am I going to eat
[1:36:55] and when she took the fruit because the
[1:36:58] branches were
[1:36:59] intertwin she was CAU in a Trap God
[1:37:03] says this time I'm going to separate
[1:37:08] them Hallelujah to such an
[1:37:12] extent that the
[1:37:14] elect cannot be
[1:37:16] deceived the elect will have that says
[1:37:20] the Lord and that says the Lord
[1:37:24] will dominate the life of one
[1:37:29] elect is that amen my
[1:37:32] brother amen he says they are now to be
[1:37:37] separated the fruits of those
[1:37:40] Vine which at such variance will be
[1:37:43] gathered in separate
[1:37:49] ghh amen the two spirits will go to
[1:37:54] separate
[1:37:59] destinations now it
[1:38:02] time the final
[1:38:04] call that comes to only the wheat
[1:38:11] Bride come out of her my
[1:38:13] people that he be not partakers of our
[1:38:17] SE that he
[1:38:21] quit you quit
[1:38:24] receive not their
[1:38:28] tears amen their
[1:38:32] plagues and he says the Great
[1:38:36] Tribulation the separation is
[1:38:39] now but it's
[1:38:42] individual that takes that
[1:38:48] St Revelation
[1:38:51] 41 are you together with
[1:38:55] me and after this I
[1:38:58] looked and behold the door was open
[1:39:04] in after this I
[1:39:08] looked after
[1:39:10] what after
[1:39:13] Jesus and stood on the
[1:39:15] door and he says behold I stand at the
[1:39:19] door open amen go to the verse up 320
[1:39:24] Revelation
[1:39:26] 3:20 behold I stand at the door and
[1:39:30] knock If any
[1:39:33] man oh God the
[1:39:38] emphasis of an individual relationship
[1:39:41] with
[1:39:44] Christ behold I stand at the door and
[1:39:48] knock If any man my
[1:39:51] voice I will
[1:39:53] come into
[1:39:56] him and will s with
[1:39:59] him and he with
[1:40:02] me we are
[1:40:05] Gentiles God deals with you as an
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:12] IND so he comes to verse
[1:40:16] four I mean 4
[1:40:19] verse1 he says after this I looked
[1:40:24] and behold the door was open in
[1:40:27] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[1:40:30] was as it way of a trumpet talking with
[1:40:37] me
[1:40:39] which come
[1:40:41] up I will show
[1:40:44] thee things which must be
[1:40:48] Hereafter so
[1:40:50] God calls you out of
[1:40:55] not to come to the knowledge of the
[1:41:00] godhead but to the
[1:41:02] revelation of the teaching
[1:41:06] Christ I will show
[1:41:09] you because you have got ears to
[1:41:16] hear are you together with me
[1:41:19] I
[1:41:21] will show you
[1:41:24] so this
[1:41:25] revelation of Christ is not
[1:41:29] Doctrine but Christ made
[1:41:33] manifest to his
[1:41:36] bride it is a
[1:41:38] presence I have now separated
[1:41:42] you I put you into the
[1:41:44] bridge so that you can enjoy fellowship

[1:41:52] that you you know at at this
[1:41:55] stage the rock the you know he has come
[1:41:59] and is now uniting himself to the bride
[1:42:04] body we are faing
[1:42:08] away from the invisible
[1:42:14] Union and melting into the visible
[1:42:20] Union that will bring him down on the
[1:42:26] he is here right
[1:42:29] now in an invisible
[1:42:32] Union but fully
[1:42:35] identified with his fruit with this
[1:42:38] bride by a fruitful
[1:42:45] life the
[1:42:47] word
[1:42:49] flesh made flesh in
[1:42:52] Christ blessing the
[1:42:55] bride listen in future
[1:43:00] home see you were made for an eternal
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:08] purpose because are the
[1:43:12] manifestation of the
[1:43:14] attribute that was in
[1:43:17] God that thought of
[1:43:20] you and expressed you and he made an
[1:43:25] ask to take you out
[1:43:28] of amen and make you a human
[1:43:34] being amen you were made for an eternal
[1:43:39] purpose you are the
[1:43:42] manifestation of the attribute of
[1:43:44] God for us to have the fullness of
[1:43:48] God then we come together that's when we
[1:43:52] make a church
[1:43:57] but first of
[1:43:58] all you must be a manifested
[1:44:04] attribute with the
[1:44:07] Revelation revealing the Life of Christ
[1:44:10] in
[1:44:12] you amen show a
[1:44:16] manri of the Eternal God and the other
[1:44:20] brother reveals
[1:44:23] is an attribute of the Eternal God then
[1:44:27] that's when we come
[1:44:29] together as a Church
[1:44:32] Fellowship and that is
[1:44:37] stability because you know who you
[1:44:42] are and you know what you're here
[1:44:46] for amen so the rock box
[1:44:51] today is Christ made manifest in his
[1:44:55] bra not the letter now but a manifested
[1:45:03] life your life is God's Divine
[1:45:08] attribute
[1:45:13] manifest that's where we are growing
[1:45:16] to that's why it says from glory to
[1:45:20] glory we grow in the presence of
[1:45:24] light that light shows every that you
[1:45:27] wash it
[1:45:29] away when you wash one daughter away
[1:45:33] that's a greater
[1:45:34] glory the light keeps
[1:45:37] shining in a certain way and you see
[1:45:40] another dot here was it away the
[1:45:45] light is our
[1:45:48] Wasing that's why we are in Ephesus I
[1:45:51] mean in in the
[1:45:54] preach praise God I'll give you a very
[1:45:58] interesting quote
[1:45:59] here amen because we have to
[1:46:03] understand that actually what we are
[1:46:06] coming
[1:46:08] to is not the
[1:46:10] letter the letter has always puffed up
[1:46:13] the
[1:46:21] people but that's not what what we are
[1:46:23] coming
[1:46:24] to we
[1:46:27] are coming into
[1:46:30] presence and in the
[1:46:32] presence it is
[1:46:35] humility but where the letter
[1:46:41] is can you manage
[1:46:43] me can you manage me should we open the
[1:46:47] Scrolls God have
[1:46:51] mercy it's
[1:46:55] preeminence it is Christ feeling all
[1:46:59] things Christ becoming the center of our
[1:47:05] Focus Amen in the monolog brother Bram
[1:47:13] says let me give you

[1:47:48] out and flopping around like it knows
[1:47:51] everything
[1:47:55] it got in the
[1:48:00] head that's the with a lot of these
[1:48:04] guys that they think they got a whole
[1:48:06] lot in their
[1:48:10] head and nothing in their
[1:48:15] heart will bow to the
[1:48:19] power recognize Jesus Christ as the son
[1:48:22] of
[1:48:24] God believe his
[1:48:27] works this is where we are it is
[1:48:31] humility it's
[1:48:34] presence it is a
[1:48:36] light a washing
[1:48:39] light we need
[1:48:41] the revelation of Jesus
[1:48:44] Christ and that will make our heads
[1:48:50] bow in respect of the return of the
[1:48:54] sea because we shall
[1:48:57] know
[1:49:00] that is coming into his
[1:49:04] F amen it is Harvest
[1:49:08] time is checking on his
[1:49:10] wheat checking on his wheat and you know
[1:49:14] this doesn't
[1:49:15] happen in
[1:49:18] winter it comes in great Heat
[1:49:23] where every seed begins to
[1:49:27] dry all the life
[1:49:30] gathers goes into the
[1:49:33] head hallelujah hallelujah in the
[1:49:36] presence of great
[1:49:38] light and the heat of his
[1:49:42] presence are you together with me this
[1:49:45] is where we
[1:49:47] are this is the
[1:49:49] season this is how God want R himself to
[1:49:55] us amen
[1:49:58] am we are in the presence now and the
[1:50:02] humility that the presence
[1:50:04] brings must be
[1:50:09] manifest so listen brother Bram in Third
[1:50:13] Exodus said we are going to deal with
[1:50:16] quite a number of qu today
[1:50:22] church has to do the same
[1:50:25] thing get out of that group of
[1:50:30] rejectors over into the
[1:50:33] promise before Messiah can ever be
[1:50:36] manifested before
[1:50:39] them he says you
[1:50:41] see the life of the
[1:50:44] Messiah
[1:50:46] manifested making church
[1:50:50] ready a bride
[1:50:57] you love
[1:50:59] him right on down the
[1:51:02] edges to the present time of the last
[1:51:06] day
[1:51:08] messenger the same life and the same
[1:51:11] light is manifested by a
[1:51:15] life that he with Christ in
[1:51:18] God Amen so down here is the MST of God
[1:51:25] revealed praise the Lord amen I don't
[1:51:30] know whether we shall finish
[1:51:32] this but I think we
[1:51:34] should are you
[1:51:36] patient amen the prophet says now you
[1:51:41] can see
[1:51:43] now the end time
[1:51:47] message why it is
[1:51:51] rejected can you
[1:51:54] now no
[1:51:56] denomination but the revelation of his
[1:52:01] mystery no
[1:52:04] denomination amen so the
[1:52:07] emphasis in the end time
[1:52:10] message is not let us make a great
[1:52:13] group but let us get
[1:52:17] individ that will accept Christ
[1:52:24] that will find their position in the
[1:52:27] body and when we come together we make
[1:52:31] the
[1:52:32] church amen he saids the
[1:52:35] revelation God is not known by
[1:52:39] denomination he known by
[1:52:42] Revelation in his
[1:52:44] body
[1:52:46] Christ and Christ in his
[1:52:49] body the bride oh man
[1:52:53] God made manifest in
[1:52:55] Christ Christ made manifest in
[1:53:01] the did you hear that the word made
[1:53:06] flesh Christ in the
[1:53:11] bride amen so the message is
[1:53:15] rejected because the emphasis of
[1:53:17] Revelation
[1:53:19] today is Christ made manifest
[1:53:23] in an individual
[1:53:25] life amen not just building this
[1:53:29] church against that
[1:53:31] church this Camp against this campy then
[1:53:36] these ones here specialize in this
[1:53:39] philosophy of the
[1:53:42] message I and Christ becoming
[1:53:47] one the word made
[1:53:50] flesh the Gentile Church
[1:53:53] is built on individual revelation of
[1:53:58] Christ when we speak of
[1:54:01] church think of yourself as
[1:54:04] church that Divine
[1:54:07] attribute that's made
[1:54:09] manifest in this
[1:54:11] season denomination of
[1:54:14] Minds cannot fit in
[1:54:17] here it cannot fit in here amen because
[1:54:21] this seon
[1:54:23] is Christ in all
[1:54:29] things
[1:54:30] listen wonderful quot
[1:54:33] here God expressed in Jesus
[1:54:38] Christ who was both Father Son and Holy
[1:54:44] Ghost the fullness of the godhead
[1:54:48] B now the complete fullness
[1:54:53] of the
[1:54:56] b in his
[1:54:58] church the
[1:55:01] preces all that God was he poured into
[1:55:05] Christ all that Christ was he has poured
[1:55:09] into the church the
[1:55:13] believer that's
[1:55:15] where the individual Ministry begins
[1:55:21] from when when a man has seen
[1:55:26] Christ not just Christ the
[1:55:30] doctrine but Christ made
[1:55:33] manifest in the life of an
[1:55:36] individual the
[1:55:38] foundation matters a
[1:55:41] lot amen so let's seeit the fin octave
[1:55:49] here word
[1:55:53] word made
[1:55:56] flesh together with
[1:55:59] me when God says Let There
[1:56:02] be there will
[1:56:05] be God is speaking the word to
[1:56:09] you to make you what he wants you to
[1:56:13] be his word never
[1:56:16] fail and once you become a written
[1:56:20] piece you are become part of the
[1:56:23] word the word made
[1:56:26] flesh and God does not change his mind
[1:56:31] about his word hallelujah he will do
[1:56:36] everything to help you
[1:56:40] overcome are you together with me just
[1:56:43] say Lord I
[1:56:45] Surrender I come to you just come and
[1:56:49] live your life in my life you become the
[1:56:53] world he will not change his mind about
[1:56:55] you he fight every one of your
[1:57:02] battles amen amen let's get final octave
[1:57:06] here in Isaiah
[1:57:10] 55: and I want you to listen to this
[1:57:13] very
[1:57:14] care he says so shall my word be that
[1:57:19] goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:57:28] it shall not come it shall not returnto
[1:57:32] me
[1:57:34] void
[1:57:36] but it will
[1:57:38] accomplish that which I
[1:57:41] please and shall
[1:57:44] prosper in
[1:57:46] everything I sent it hallelujah
[1:57:50] hallelujah do you believe the message
[1:57:53] that's the word of God it will never go
[1:57:56] back to God
[1:57:59] void without creating a bride and that
[1:58:03] bride is you the
[1:58:08] believer and then he comes here in John
[1:58:14] 663 and he says it is the
[1:58:18] spirit that
[1:58:20] quickness the flesh
[1:58:22] proest nothing the words that I speak
[1:58:26] unto
[1:58:27] you they are spirits and they Al
[1:58:31] life so
[1:58:34] Lucifer listen chose to deal with the
[1:58:37] intellectual PR of a
[1:58:43] man
[1:58:46] amen that's the
[1:58:49] devil he deals with int but God CH his
[1:58:55] heart to the Head Lucifer Minister
[1:59:02] theology from the same
[1:59:04] message but to
[1:59:06] the god Minister
[1:59:11] life amen Lucifer can pick up the
[1:59:16] letter amen and use
[1:59:18] it like he lied to Eve in the Garden of
[1:59:25] Eden he can give the letter a false
[1:59:31] application amen but he can as well
[1:59:34] Minister it
[1:59:37] exactly but without pointing to the
[1:59:41] life behind the
[1:59:47] letter he feels
[1:59:51] uncomfortable tell the people to come to
[1:59:55] life he wants you just leave that thing
[2:00:00] there amen there's no way the devil can
[2:00:04] ever emphasize
[2:00:07] life in the word because that
[2:00:13] life is the life of the
[2:00:17] blood and the devil wouldn't have
[2:00:19] nothing to do with the blood
[2:00:24] are you together with me so Lucifer can
[2:00:28] Minister the
[2:00:30] letter but he can never open the CH of
[2:00:34] life to that
[2:00:38] letter that's what you want this
[2:00:41] morning that we may open up the channels
[2:00:43] of
[2:00:45] life that the revelation of Christ you
[2:00:49] have becomes a foundation
[2:00:53] upon which the church is built and the
[2:00:56] gates of
[2:00:57] hell can never Prevail
[2:00:59] against
[2:01:02] amen you know the devil can give you the
[2:01:05] letter to give you a conscious that you
[2:01:08] are in the
[2:01:09] word because you can explain the
[2:01:12] godhead but today we are looking beyond
[2:01:16] the
[2:01:17] godhead the life
[2:01:20] itself the ministry of Christ must
[2:01:23] reflect his
[2:01:25] life the words I speak unto you are
[2:01:30] spirit and
[2:01:34] life praise God second Corinthians
[2:01:40] 36 you see so much contented with the
[2:01:47] letter but not
[2:01:49] comfortable with the life behind the
[2:01:55] letter we pray God to have
[2:01:57] Grace because it will
[2:02:00] be from glory to
[2:02:04] glory I don't know you are not I
[2:02:08] believe that you are not going to remain
[2:02:10] the
[2:02:11] same by the time you go out
[2:02:14] here you'll have stepped on another
[2:02:17] higher level of
[2:02:19] God Amen Corinthians
[2:02:24] 3:6 the holy spirit says who
[2:02:28] also has made us
[2:02:34] Ministers of the New
[2:02:37] Testament hallelujah hallelujah the Old
[2:02:41] Testament Don't
[2:02:43] touch don't eat rest
[2:02:48] Sabbath do this and do that but the new
[2:02:52] Testament is the
[2:02:54] life from those
[2:02:59] ordinances amen that's the New
[2:03:02] Testament the New
[2:03:05] Testament is not a period of
[2:03:09] time a new testament is the life in the
[2:03:15] blood so what we are doing
[2:03:18] today is God help us
[2:03:21] touch the life from under the blood and
[2:03:26] let that life transform our lives so
[2:03:29] that we may become Christ
[2:03:32] revealed in bodies
[2:03:35] again and the revelation we have you
[2:03:38] will have the confidence to build your
[2:03:41] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[2:03:44] Prevail
[2:03:49] against who alsoo made us Ministers of
[2:03:53] the New
[2:03:56] Testament not of the
[2:03:59] letter but of the
[2:04:01] spirit for the letter
[2:04:04] kth but the spirit give
[2:04:09] life so we are not in the
[2:04:12] word until you know we
[2:04:16] know that the word in itself is life
[2:04:21] the word of God Isaiah says is not
[2:04:27] void the word of God is
[2:04:31] life amen it returns
[2:04:36] manifestation and brings the
[2:04:40] purpose for which it was
[2:04:43] sent the word was
[2:04:45] sent not for me to remain the same way
[2:04:49] no
[2:04:51] the word was
[2:04:53] sent that the spirit the life in the
[2:04:58] word may give me power of
[2:05:04] transformation
[2:05:06] amen okay so the word of
[2:05:10] God is Not vo Isaiah says so shall my
[2:05:15] word
[2:05:17] be that goeth out of my
[2:05:19] mouth it shall not turn me
[2:05:23] voice but it shall
[2:05:25] accomplish it shall
[2:05:27] fulfill it shall make a
[2:05:30] way amen praise God this is the word of
[2:05:34] God so God is not in
[2:05:38] vain in his words because his word is a
[2:05:43] spirit and life once he has spoken the
[2:05:47] word father make me a good ground what
[2:05:52] that word let it come to
[2:05:56] life amen so when that word Goes
[2:06:00] Forth it always creates a
[2:06:03] body of manifestation
[2:06:07] around that's
[2:06:10] true when he says Let There
[2:06:14] Be then the
[2:06:16] word was the
[2:06:18] description but then the word put up a
[2:06:23] body to produce the purpose for which
[2:06:26] the word was
[2:06:30] spoken when he says let there be
[2:06:34] light then there BR forth a body of
[2:06:38] light the word will always create a
[2:06:43] body behind
[2:06:46] itself the one is always made flesh
[2:06:55] praise the Lord are you happy this
[2:06:57] morning is the spirit that
[2:07:01] Quicken the flesh proth
[2:07:05] nothing but the words I speak unto you
[2:07:07] their spirit and
[2:07:10] life meaning that under the spoken
[2:07:14] word there is a creative
[2:07:17] power the words that I speak
[2:07:21] spirit and
[2:07:23] life amen so God's word has enough power
[2:07:27] in
[2:07:28] it to transform
[2:07:31] itself into living
[2:07:35] substance are you written
[2:07:39] Epistles are you the word of
[2:07:42] God then there is creative
[2:07:46] power behind the
[2:07:48] word to make you Bri
[2:07:51] [Applause]
[2:07:55] you know the devil is a
[2:07:57] liar he always gets your eyes on the
[2:08:02] impossible it God who says you are my
[2:08:07] bride you don't have to say but can I
[2:08:10] can I it's God who says he says you are
[2:08:14] perfect you are complete and can I can
[2:08:19] I that's the
[2:08:22] be
[2:08:28] positive the word is not only
[2:08:33] sound but a creative revelation of the
[2:08:39] father you hear what the prophet says
[2:08:42] here before a
[2:08:44] word it is a
[2:08:47] thought and a thought has to be created
[2:08:51] so God's
[2:08:53] thoughts become
[2:08:55] creation when spoken by the
[2:08:58] word he said there will be a
[2:09:01] briad it came from the mind of God with
[2:09:05] creative power and the bride is
[2:09:11] you amen he says here and you happy for
[2:09:16] that
[2:09:18] day that our God makes every word
[2:09:23] manest he doesn't speak ID
[2:09:27] words he told us not
[2:09:30] do but he speaks every word just
[2:09:35] exactly so listen friend the word we are
[2:09:38] ministering this morning to you is the
[2:09:41] creative
[2:09:43] revelation of what God wants you to
[2:09:47] be and brother Bram says
[2:09:51] there is anything
[2:09:53] good that will come to
[2:09:56] me it has to be revealed by the
[2:10:01] spirit confirmed by the
[2:10:03] word and made manifest by the result it
[2:10:08] Bears that's the word it always
[2:10:13] creative it will bring forth
[2:10:16] fruit amen
[2:10:18] amen amen you need to to know who you
[2:10:23] are amen the word must bear
[2:10:26] fruit it must come
[2:10:29] alive because it is life in
[2:10:33] itself
[2:10:35] amen
[2:10:37] sir I love him this
[2:10:41] morning you know the church must have a
[2:10:44] solid ground to
[2:10:47] stand without which you be blown by
[2:10:52] every wind of
[2:10:55] doct the people will come with
[2:10:59] anything and they call it
[2:11:02] word and you say
[2:11:07] Amen the word became
[2:11:10] flesh and therefore the word we
[2:11:13] teach as long as it's
[2:11:16] Christ it also become
[2:11:19] flesh in the many member body
[2:11:23] amen so when this word Goes
[2:11:25] Forth in this age it must build itself
[2:11:29] another body and this body is called The
[2:11:33] Bride of the Lord Jesus
[2:11:36] Christ amen that's what it is the
[2:11:41] Bride of the
[2:11:43] Lord Jesus Christ so believe the word
[2:11:49] meditate on it take it ask God to make
[2:11:55] it
[2:11:56] life so we go to the scripture we
[2:12:01] read and then we shall finish right
[2:12:04] there John
[2:12:08] 114 the holy spirit
[2:12:11] says and the
[2:12:13] Word was
[2:12:16] made
[2:12:18] flesh now the word was
[2:12:23] made there was the action of
[2:12:28] forming that the word that was
[2:12:34] Spirit now found a body
[2:12:39] dwelling the
[2:12:40] word became
[2:12:43] flesh in the Lord Jesus
[2:12:47] Christ so in this drama
[2:12:51] when he becomes
[2:12:53] Christ he is the same one
[2:12:58] God with the same creative
[2:13:01] power same authority to
[2:13:05] subdue and to have
[2:13:07] dominion same
[2:13:10] God in changing
[2:13:14] forms and brother Bram called this Anor
[2:13:18] he used the Greek word
[2:13:22] meaning a
[2:13:25] form by which a
[2:13:27] person or thing strikes
[2:13:32] division external
[2:13:35] appearance so the
[2:13:37] word became flesh it took
[2:13:41] Anor it took a body to
[2:13:45] translate the Unseen
[2:13:48] word and today as you believe the word
[2:13:52] you are the body that is going to be the
[2:13:56] translation of the word you are the
[2:13:59] written EP and the people look at you
[2:14:03] and they will call you the body of the
[2:14:05] Lord Jesus Christ made
[2:14:10] flesh amen so
[2:14:14] friends here we are we
[2:14:18] build ourselves
[2:14:21] in the local
[2:14:23] church this man that man that woman that
[2:14:26] woman we come together but why because
[2:14:31] every one of us is an attribute of the
[2:14:36] father and we have the
[2:14:39] Revelation that God puts us in this
[2:14:42] place because he knows
[2:14:45] us and he puts us under a
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:49] Ministry when I say Ministry and meaning
[2:14:52] of the other ministers that
[2:14:55] minister so that God can use this men to
[2:15:00] help you
[2:15:03] overcome he
[2:15:04] [Applause]
[2:15:05] hides behind the wickedness of the
[2:15:08] people to make himself
[2:15:12] known so when you see the
[2:15:16] weakness when you see the
[2:15:19] Christ it doesn't mean God is not
[2:15:24] there just watch when the ministers put
[2:15:28] the word in the
[2:15:30] area the lamb will come
[2:15:34] forth and you'll say Jehovah Gyra God
[2:15:38] will always
[2:15:39] Supply amen what's your trouble what's
[2:15:43] your problem this one says family that
[2:15:47] one says that another one says another
[2:15:50] thing this one says sickness but in the
[2:15:54] right
[2:15:55] season God will come and V you in the
[2:16:00] area of your
[2:16:01] need and God will show himself
[2:16:10] alive praise the Lord the word made
[2:16:15] flesh what do you think flesh
[2:16:19] is praise the Lord yes sir you know the
[2:16:25] flesh is weak it
[2:16:28] fails even when God came down into this
[2:16:33] flesh certain things would happen to
[2:16:36] him when he visited Abraham he walked
[2:16:40] fromon he walked from eternity a long
[2:16:44] journey and then he came down in the
[2:16:48] ples of memory by the time he came came
[2:16:51] to Abraham he was visibly hungry he was
[2:16:55] dirty he was
[2:17:01] tired but
[2:17:03] God he behind
[2:17:06] that and still say in the time of life
[2:17:11] you shall have a
[2:17:15] child together with me praise God
[2:17:21] don't
[2:17:22] look at where you
[2:17:24] fail that's where God wants to meet
[2:17:32] you the family the
[2:17:35] individual the local
[2:17:37] church our weakness is where God hide
[2:17:42] himself and show himself a
[2:17:47] life praise the Lord
[2:17:51] God bless
[2:17:53] you we shall not have it all
[2:17:56] today but we shall continue building on
[2:18:01] it it's being a
[2:18:03] Believer is not just taking ah yes I was
[2:18:08] baptized yeah and I got such and such a
[2:18:12] church no it's presenting
[2:18:16] yourself in the presence of the world
[2:18:19] that the lightting
[2:18:23] you what God
[2:18:26] wants Hallelujah
[2:18:29] hallelu and as long as the word has
[2:18:33] formed it brings such a
[2:18:37] humility like it did with
[2:18:39] Mary and said Let It Be unto
[2:18:43] meing to word the word in her became
[2:18:49] flesh

[2:20:26] body is in the bride and every one of us
[2:20:31] if we are part of the
[2:20:33] world every one of us therefore is the
[2:20:38] verse in this Rich

[2:20:56] are part of him then we
