[2:39] baptism
[2:41] is the one that declared Jesus Christ
[2:45] was not restoring but was starting
[2:49] something new
[2:51] but here Jesus
[3:03] started a new way
[3:38] the truth that has been lost
[3:41] so he comes and restores
[3:44] [Applause]
[3:46] and this is the day that we are living

[7:27] now in 1933 when he was speaking this
[7:32] yeah the technology was so remote
[7:35] technology

[12:20] that at this end time that God has sent
[12:23] to our gender
[12:26] foreign
[12:47] when he was preaching in 1965.

[12:56] he was preaching in the International
[12:58] Convention of the Full Gospel
[13:01] businessman in Phoenix Arizona
[13:07] Phoenix and now brother Branham was
[13:11] going to preach the message on the birth
[13:13] pains
[13:16] and he was taking his text from John
[13:19] chapter 16.
[13:22] verse 21 to verse 22.
[13:25] it was a Sunday right it was Sunday now
[13:28] his wife had given him a new Bible
[13:32] so when brother Branham was opening his
[13:34] Bible
[13:35] the pages there
[13:39] they were not showing John 16 21.
[13:46] and he was troubled yeah yeah I want to
[13:49] read John 16 20.
[13:51] The Bible Pages were not okay
[13:57] there was an Archbishop
[13:59] of the Catholic Church
[14:02] who is called
[14:04] the most Reverend John Stanley whatever
[14:08] land you understand so he came yeah
[14:10] because he was on the platform he came
[14:14] with this Bible here and he gave it to
[14:16] him and when he gave him he told him use
[14:20] it and then he said there is a reason
[14:24] why it was done and you know it and God
[14:29] will show you something to bring out of
[14:32] this that's what the the Archbishop told
[14:36] him
[14:37] so later that foreign
[14:56] and then he started wondering
[14:59] then the moment he had good that the
[15:01] pages were stuck and able to open them
[15:05] a voice spoke to him as clear as a voice
[15:09] speaking to you hello
[15:14] and referred him to Luke Chapter 4.
[15:18] I started reading from verse 16 to verse
[15:20] 22. the voice was speaking that was the
[15:24] spirit of God
[15:25] and the voice it was also revealed to
[15:28] him Isaiah 61.
[15:30] let us go to Isaiah chapter 61 and verse
[15:33] 1 and 2.
[15:36] foreign
[15:47] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[15:49] because the Lord has anointed me to
[15:53] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has
[15:55] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[15:58] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[16:01] opening of the prison to them that are
[16:03] bound to proclaim the acceptoria of the
[16:05] Lord and the day of Vengeance of Our
[16:08] Lord to comfort all that money is
[16:55] where he was brought up and as his
[16:58] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[17:01] the Sabbath day and stood up to it
[17:12] and there was delivered unto him the
[17:15] book of prophet Isaiah and when he had
[17:17] opened the book he found a place where
[17:19] it was written in
[17:28] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[17:30] because he has anointed me to preach the
[17:33] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[17:36] heal the brokenhearted to preach the
[17:38] liver into the captives and recovering
[17:41] of sight of the blind to set at Liberty
[17:43] them that are bruised
[17:59] now he read Isaiah 61.
[18:03] and then verse
[18:06] Luke 4 19
[18:09] to preach the acceptoria of the Lord
[18:14] he was reading Isaiah chapter 61.
[18:20] but Jesus when he was reading Isaiah
[18:23] chapter 61 verse 2.
[18:29] he stopped in the middle yeah
[18:55] [Music]
[19:21] [Music]
[19:26] in our generation
[20:01] but he took him there I am
[20:12] [Applause]
[20:22] [Applause]
[20:32] [Applause]
[20:55] Elijah the prophet
[20:58] all the mysteries of God have been
[21:01] revealed let us go to Daniel chapter 12.
[21:06] praise the name of us I just want to
[21:09] finish actually to end of my reason
[21:12] Daniel chapter 12.
[21:14] and then verse 4
[21:17] but though Daniel
[21:20] shut up the world
