[26:27] I can't imagine how I can thank him for
[26:30] his greatness he is activism
[26:35] provision and protection
[26:38] towards me yeah indeed one day I decided
[26:41] to go a three-day Journey
[26:46] praying and fasting
[26:48] and while there I requested the Lord for
[26:52] five things
[26:57] one of them was a job around my home
[27:00] Church
[27:03] which is provided and those has
[27:06] protected it up to today
[27:08] they appreciate God for that
[27:11] amen amen
[27:14] I remember brother Dan initially was
[27:16] also being told to work on Sunday
[27:20] but I told him if your heart is to come
[27:23] to church
[27:26] God will make you find favor before your
[27:28] bosses
[27:30] and they will allow you to come and pray
[27:32] but if your heart is not coming to
[27:35] church
[27:51] God will always make her for you to
[27:53] fulfill your heart's desire
[27:56] and so we thank God that he's always
[27:58] coming to service
[28:00] praise the name of our Lord then he said
[28:03] secondly I also requested him for a good
[28:06] wife
[28:07] and I want to inform the church
[28:10] that the Lord has made it for me
[28:14] and provided that for me
[28:18] amen

[28:21] wife

[39:35] and by Grace Heavenly Father we are
[39:39] going to overcome all our weaknesses we
[39:42] are going to overcome all our failures
[39:49] [Music]
[40:42] in the finished work of
[40:44] amen
[41:10] amen let us turn to John chapter one
[41:14] we are reading from verse 14.
[41:18] up to verse 17.
[41:21] praise the name of our Lord John chapter
[41:24] one
[41:25] from verse 14 to verse 17.
[41:30] the scripture says
[41:33] and the Word was made flesh and drilled
[41:36] among us and we beheld his glory the
[41:40] glory as of the only begotten of the
[41:42] father full of grace and truth is
[41:55] John bear witness of him and cried
[41:59] saying this was he of whom I spoke he
[42:03] that cometh after me is preferred before
[42:06] me for he was before me and of his
[42:09] fullness have all will received and
[42:12] Grace for grace for the law was given by
[42:15] Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[42:19] Christ
[42:20] foreign
[42:53] you're welcome again to the services of
[42:55] the lord
[42:56] we have only one service today
[43:01] I'm depending upon the grace of God this
[43:04] morning
[43:05] now I want to preach on the subject
[43:09] Grace To Live upright thank you sir
[43:16] Grace To Live upright
[43:20] praise the name of Allah in other words
[43:25] God gives us Grace
[43:27] To Live upright
[43:31] God gives us Grace
[43:34] To Live righteously
[43:38] God gives us Grace
[43:40] to become perfect
[43:44] praise the name of our Lord in your own
[43:47] self
[43:48] you can't do it
[43:51] you can't make it in your own self
[43:55] praise the name of Allah you may try
[43:58] this but then we need to appreciate it
[44:02] the Bible says when we read in Psalms
[44:07] chapter 51 where someone is
[44:11] and then you read in verse 5.
[44:15] the Holy Scripture says
[44:20] behold I was shaped in sin in iniquity
[44:24] and in ascended my mother conceive me
[44:32] now you can imagine a man like David
[44:36] and yet the scripture says that David
[44:41] was a man after God's Own hearts
[44:47] that was the testimony of God
[44:51] that I've gotten myself a man
[44:55] who is after my heart
[45:00] that's how God was giving a testimony
[45:03] about David
[45:04] and then David we know
[45:07] he was anointed
[45:11] by a prophet called Samuel
[45:15] praise the name of Allah he had the
[45:18] anointing of God upon him
[46:13] [Music]
[46:16] and the angel came and gave the prophecy
[46:20] but then we see that many prophets in
[46:22] the Old Testament we are prophesying
[46:25] about the ministry of John the Baptist
[46:29] Isaiah prophesied about the minister of
[46:31] John the Baptist
[46:33] prophesied about the minister of John
[46:35] the Baptist Church
[46:47] he is going to be filled with the Holy
[46:50] when he's in his mother
[46:54] and then we see the ministry of John the
[46:57] Baptist
[46:58] how he comes and now when he comes and
[47:02] sees the Lord Jesus Christ he says but I
[47:05] need you I am I need of you
[47:08] praise the name of our Lord to baptize
[47:11] me but this is the man was baptized with
[47:14] the Holy Ghost and his mother's womb so
[47:18] because he came in this body he felt a
[47:21] lot of deficiency in this body
[47:25] there are a lot of weaknesses
[47:33] and then he introduces Christ before the
[47:37] Lamb of God that takes away
[47:42] so the world currency could not know
[47:46] Christ
[47:47] without John the Baptist
[47:50] praise the name the same thing we are
[47:53] also having now is that we are living in
[47:56] a time of Elijah the prophet
[47:59] where a God that centers
[48:03] [Music]
[48:59] is it the crime Andrew
[49:14] many times we get ourselves into complex
[49:18] conditions
[49:22] you get yourself in a stranger
[49:25] that is not pleasant
[49:28] you get yourself in weaknesses you get
[49:32] yourself in Failure you get yourself in
[49:36] fear you get yourself in down
[49:39] like Moses after seeing the power of God
[49:44] crossing the Red Sea and then all the
[49:47] Lord was doing
[49:49] was asking God these people want flesh
[49:56] and then God said I'm going to give them
[49:59] until to come out of their nostrils
[50:06] foreign
[50:07] can you imagine that what was that
[50:09] question are you going to get all the
[50:11] fish from the reef the lake the sea and
[50:14] give these people
[50:16] he was forgetting that God is a Creator
[50:23] even us in our conditions
[50:28] it may be certain kind of weakness it
[50:32] may be certain kind of failure maybe a
[50:35] certain kind of fear maybe a certain
[50:38] kind of frustration
[50:40] too much debt
[50:42] because no joy at home no peace at home
[50:46] no joy at the place of wine but the Lord
[50:50] our God is the creator of all that you
[50:54] have needed
[50:56] if this expression that is complicated
[51:01] our Lord knows nothing about that
[51:04] complication
[51:06] it will not no
[51:13] here
[51:14] we need to look unto him
[51:17] and that's what the Bible says
[51:25] let us go to Job chapter 14.
[51:30] praise the name of our Lord chapter 14.
[51:35] and then verse 1 Canada
[51:39] so the Bible says man that is born of a
[51:42] woman is of a few days and full of
[51:44] trouble
[51:49] he comes forth like a flower and is cut
[51:52] down he flees also as a shadow and
[51:55] continues notes
[52:03] who can bring a clean thing
[52:07] out of unclean not one
[52:10] verse 4.

[53:02] some kind of you know place which is
[53:04] well protected and gazetted it's
[53:11] a nature that we we inherit because of
[53:17] sin that was done in the garden now

[53:25] is necessary
[53:28] because our first box
[53:30] put us in expression we can't help
[53:33] ourselves
[53:35] so that's why we need the second box
[53:39] from the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:46] by our Lord Jesus Christ yes Crystal let
[53:50] us go to Hebrews chapter 2.
[54:01] he took note on him the nature of angels
[54:04] but he took on him the Seed of Abraham
[54:08] as
[54:15] wherefore in all things it believed in
[54:19] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[54:23] that he might be a merciful and faithful

[1:20:19] 12.
[1:20:21] and the younger of them say that to his
[1:20:24] father father give me the portion of
[1:20:26] goods that followeth to me and they
[1:20:28] divided unto him his living
[1:20:38] and not many days after the young son
[1:20:41] gathered all together and took his
[1:20:43] journey into a far country and there
[1:20:46] wasted his substance with riotius living
[1:20:50] um
[1:21:04] and when he had spent all their roles a
[1:21:09] mighty famine in the land and they began
[1:21:13] to be in want uh

[1:23:13] the Bible when he came to himself
[1:23:18] he remembered his father
[1:23:21] we also need to come to ourselves
[1:23:26] now that coming to himself
[1:23:30] it was the grace of God
[1:23:33] that he extended to him
[1:23:38] where he's coming from
[1:23:40] and we also need the same Grace
[1:23:46] to come to our realization
[1:23:50] that the weaknesses that we have enough
[1:23:52] the troubles that we have
[1:23:55] that is not our position
[1:23:58] we have been called to live a higher

[1:27:46] God is a very present help
[1:27:51] when we're in trouble what do you do
[1:27:55] call upon him
[1:27:58] just call upon the name of the Lord

[1:31:07] Lord this is my condition no this is

[1:31:31] but make me as one of the higher
[1:31:34] servants
[1:31:37] and the Bible says he arose yes to come

[1:32:38] Devils
[1:32:41] you first started the church
[1:32:49] these doors are open for Sinners to come
[1:32:52] into images
[1:32:56] they are open
[1:32:58] for the Sinners to come in
[1:33:00] here and now when they come in they
[1:33:03] experience the presence of God but
[1:33:05] foreign
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:49] what
[1:33:54] happened though your sins

[1:34:05] to keep us upright
[1:34:10] you need the grace of God
[1:34:13] every other day you need the grace and
[1:34:17] then now we need also to know
[1:34:20] that we were born in sin because
[1:34:29] but when we received the salvation of
[1:34:32] Christ
[1:34:33] it is the soul amen that has been saved
[1:34:38] your body which you are living in now
[1:34:42] has not yet been saved
[1:34:44] has not yet the Salvation
[1:34:49] is when it is changed
[1:34:53] from this small talk
[1:34:56] from this corruption
[1:34:59] but right now you are living in a body
[1:35:03] or a movie that still has the nature of
[1:35:06] sin
[1:35:06] that came as a result of sin
[1:35:10] is the soul inside
[1:35:12] that has been redeemed so what does the
[1:35:16] Lord do when you come to him make sure
[1:35:20] that he fills you with his holness
[1:35:24] and then the Bible foreign
[1:35:38] praise the name of our Lord Ephesians
[1:35:40] chapter 4 verse 31 says
[1:35:44] it's verse 30. and grieve not the holy
[1:35:48] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:35:51] unto the day of redemption
[1:35:56] is
[1:36:00] in Romans chapter 8
[1:36:08] and then verse 23
[1:36:10] he says
[1:36:13] and not only a day but ourselves also
[1:36:16] which have the first fruits of the
[1:36:17] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:36:21] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:36:25] wait the Redemption of our body
[1:36:28] okay
[1:36:39] praise the name of our Lord so the Bible
[1:36:42] is telling us
[1:36:44] he sees us with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:47] and that's it until the day of
[1:36:51] redemption
[1:36:53] and now the Redemption is talking about
[1:36:56] is the Redemption of our bodies
[1:37:01] when our bodies will reach a stage that
[1:37:04] they cannot grow old
[1:37:07] when our bodies reach a condition that
[1:37:09] they can never be tempted
[1:37:13] when our bodies reach a condition that
[1:37:16] they cannot die
[1:37:18] when our bodies reach a condition that
[1:37:21] they cannot be tired
[1:37:23] but right now the devil has got access
[1:37:27] to our bodies
[1:37:29] you can come and put sickness
[1:37:37] so now you see that the devil has access
[1:37:42] only the song that has been foreign
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:30] and then verse one
[1:38:33] praise the name of Allah
[1:38:38] so I beseech you there for Brethren by
[1:38:41] the masses of God that you present your
[1:38:44] body's a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:38:47] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:38:50] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:38:53] to this world but be it transformed by
[1:38:55] the renewing of your mind that you may
[1:38:57] prove that which is good and acceptable
[1:39:00] and perfect will of God yes
[1:39:22] praise the name of our Lord now so we
[1:39:25] surrendered in Job chapter 14.
[1:39:28] that you cannot get a good thing
[1:39:33] out of something
[1:39:35] the bodies were Living Praise
[1:39:38] Trump
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:50] that's okay
[1:39:52] but in the course of the day you find
[1:39:55] you are tired you are disgusted you want
[1:39:59] to rest you want to refresh yourself
[1:40:02] and so God has put the provisions in our
[1:40:06] lives
[1:40:08] that can make us
[1:40:10] praise the name of us be able to get to
[1:40:13] the level of Victory
[1:40:16] praise the name of us now in the message
[1:40:19] questions and answers
[1:40:23] you could not make them
[1:40:27] they are told
[1:40:29] two different lives all together
[1:40:36] then he says
[1:40:39] the only thing you have to do is to
[1:40:42] plant them
[1:40:43] they both look alike before another
[1:40:47] I think I may have to jump
[1:40:51] we have to jump some some things there
[1:40:53] he says
[1:40:58] do you know every
[1:41:00] foot the sun rises tomorrow morning
[1:41:06] now if you're not a Christian my friend
[1:41:10] there's only one thing left for you
[1:41:12] you've got to go that way
[1:41:16] if you are on that road
[1:41:20] no
[1:41:43] and just lets you become a church and be
[1:41:46] a member of that church
[1:41:51] praise the name of Allah
[1:41:54] you say well brother Brandon my church
[1:41:57] teaches that we accept Jesus as our
[1:41:59] personal savior
[1:42:01] if we believe the Lord Jesus
[1:42:09] you haven't made it okay
[1:42:12] so now when we come to Christ
[1:42:16] we make sure that Christ changes us
[1:42:21] there has to be a transformation
[1:42:24] the life
[1:42:27] in the sacrifice
[1:42:29] has to come down
[1:42:34] and it changes and Deliver us so that if
[1:42:40] the devil gets us trapped somewhere
[1:42:43] you know where to go back
[1:42:47] like the prodigal son he knew where to
[1:42:51] go
[1:42:52] he knew where he fell from he knew where
[1:42:55] he lost his job
[1:42:57] he lost his peace
[1:43:01] let me make reconciliation
[1:43:06] now in the message acts of the Holy
[1:43:08] Ghost
[1:43:10] times may be hard
[1:43:14] God has not promised a flower bed of
[1:43:17] ease
[1:43:20] but he has promised Grace
[1:43:24] sufficient for every trial
[1:43:27] foreign
[1:44:06] grace is sufficient
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:45] foreign
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:23] who gave you the life you have
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:28] so you tell him Lord
[1:45:33] the grace the cross looks Behavior
[1:45:36] foreign
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:46:02] praise the name of Allah First
[1:46:04] Corinthians chapter 10 and then verse
[1:46:06] 13.
[1:46:08] the Holy Scripture tells us to cover
[1:46:13] there has no temptation taking you such
[1:46:16] as is common to man
[1:46:21] but God is faithful
[1:46:26] who will not suffer to be tempted above
[1:46:29] that you are able
[1:46:33] but will with the
[1:46:35] Temptation also make a way to escape
[1:46:39] that you may be able to Bear it
[1:46:42] is
[1:46:49] the name of Allah so he says any
[1:46:52] Temptation you go through
[1:47:01] he has given Grace
[1:47:05] there is Grace in your condition my
[1:47:08] brothers
[1:47:09] Grace in your condition myself
[1:47:13] Lord I need the grace
[1:47:18] I need your mercy
[1:47:21] I need your deliverance
[1:47:25] there is
[1:47:28] how the Lord Has Done in this journey
[1:47:32] is whatever thing that you meet
[1:47:36] he has already made the world
[1:47:39] so you can't be stuck
[1:47:42] it's the wisdom of God
[1:47:45] when the prodigal son was stuck
[1:47:51] you know when he went to a far country
[1:47:54] he has switched off his phone nobody
[1:47:57] knows where he lives
[1:47:59] air he says now he I can do whatever I
[1:48:02] want there's only one you know what God
[1:48:04] did he said they are framing he hasn't
[1:48:09] praise the name of it to make him
[1:48:11] remember home
[1:48:15] maybe I'd go into some of these
[1:48:17] denominations
[1:48:18] and they were calling him you're great
[1:48:22] but whatever it says what they are doing
[1:48:27] not comfortable here let me go back to
[1:48:30] myself
[1:48:32] God sent their family
[1:48:35] praise the name of our Lord to make him
[1:48:38] want
[1:48:41] to come back
[1:48:43] God made a way of Escape for him
[1:48:48] by sending
[1:48:50] now you can imagine became
[1:48:56] but we don't need to reach that
[1:48:58] secretary let sickness not become the
[1:49:02] way of escape
[1:49:03] to bring us back to God let it not be
[1:49:07] there
[1:49:09] live before him with all your life
[1:49:13] into his Services
[1:49:20] doing the will of God
[1:49:22] praise the name of Allah
[1:49:25] was so much concerned and God is so much
[1:49:30] concerned
[1:49:33] let us go to Psalms 112.
[1:49:37] a community
[1:49:39] praise the name of Allah Psalms 112.
[1:49:44] the scripture says
[1:49:48] Praise You the Lord blessed is the man
[1:49:51] that fear is the Lord that delighted
[1:49:55] greatly in his Commandments
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:03] his sin shall be Mighty upon us the
[1:50:06] generation of the upright shall be
[1:50:09] blessed is
[1:50:18] wealth and riches shall be in his house
[1:50:21] and his righteousness endureth forever
[1:50:32] and then in the verse for the Bible says
[1:50:40] there arises
[1:50:43] in the darkness
[1:50:46] he is gracious
[1:50:48] and full of compassion
[1:50:51] and righteous
[1:50:54] praise the name of us I forgot to come
[1:50:57] with the pointer today
[1:51:01] but the Bible is
[1:51:19] what was the upright doing in darkness
[1:51:22] yeah
[1:51:28] but because of the life that we live
[1:51:33] the environments that we live
[1:51:36] can bring that form of Darkness
[1:51:39] it may be Darkness at your place
[1:51:43] it may be Darkness at home it may be
[1:51:47] Darkness at your place
[1:51:49] and the Darkness may come in any form of
[1:51:54] conditions
[1:51:56] may come because maybe they don't want
[1:51:58] you
[1:51:59] may come because of your failures may
[1:52:03] come because of your weaknesses
[1:52:11] but when the upright is in darkness it
[1:52:15] doesn't end in darkness
[1:52:17] the Bible says
[1:52:19] in darkness there arises
[1:52:25] in your Darkness this morning
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:27] who is this man foreign
[1:53:44] and you know the leaves could hide them
[1:53:46] but Jesus is passing by yeah I could
[1:53:50] tell you his place away may God also
[1:53:53] pass back
[1:53:55] our conditions
[1:54:01] our sins and when he passes by that's
[1:54:05] why
[1:54:06] salvation is
[1:54:08] praise the name of us let us go to the
[1:54:12] Book of Luke
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:36] so when Jesus came back
[1:54:42] he said salvation
[1:54:44] is coming to this house
[1:54:48] this tax collector was living in
[1:54:50] darkness
[1:54:53] but he had the desire
[1:54:55] and when the Lord visited this house
[1:55:01] salvation came to his Deliverance
[1:55:04] the Bible says
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:30] the light has come to set you free okay
[1:55:33] all your failures
[1:55:37] it's the grace that God gives us
[1:55:40] to live upright before him
[1:55:43] desire of God that we may live our
[1:55:47] practice
[1:55:51] continue doing that which is right
[1:55:56] look what Paulo Paul Paolo a Pharisee
[1:56:02] you know a person who was so zealous
[1:56:07] he was living in darkness
[1:56:12] and then when he was dwelling there you
[1:56:15] know he would maybe like say I've never
[1:56:18] done this evil I've never done this in
[1:56:22] Philippians chapter 3
[1:56:24] and then verse
[1:56:27] foreign
[1:56:37] though I might also have confidence in
[1:56:39] the flesh If any man thinketh that he
[1:56:42] has where often my trust in the flesh I
[1:56:45] know
[1:56:49] um
[1:56:53] circumcise The Eighth Day of the stroke
[1:56:56] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and
[1:56:59] Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the
[1:57:01] law a Pharisee is
[1:57:13] concerning the persecuting the church
[1:57:15] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:57:18] the law blameless
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:29] praise the name of Allah he had his past
[1:57:33] experiences
[1:57:35] but in all his past experience
[1:57:39] waiter we are not known the Lord Of
[1:57:41] Glory yeah
[1:57:45] until he was on the road to Damascus
[1:57:49] in Acts chapter 8.
[1:57:52] praise the name Acts chapter 9. and then
[1:57:56] the Lord appeared to him and now when
[1:57:59] the Lord appeared to him he revealed
[1:58:03] himself to Paul yeah
[1:58:07] the Lord will separate him from my
[1:58:09] mother's womb
[1:58:11] when he revealed himself to me
[1:58:15] and that's what we need we need to have
[1:58:18] a personal revelation of God
[1:58:21] when you have a personal revelation
[1:58:25] foreign
[1:58:41] to of Christ himself coming to you
[1:58:45] let us go to Galatians chapter one
[1:58:48] and then verse 11. but I satisfied you
[1:58:53] Brethren
[1:58:54] and the gospel which was preached of me
[1:58:57] is not after mine
[1:59:00] for I never received it of man
[1:59:04] neither was I taught
[1:59:07] but by revelation
[1:59:09] of Jesus Christ yes
[1:59:13] and then in verse 15.
[1:59:16] but when it pleased God
[1:59:19] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:59:23] called me by his grace
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:29] I might preach him a man
[1:59:33] I immediately Comfort not with flesh
[1:59:38] so power had to have a personal
[1:59:40] revelation
[2:00:19] that's good romance chapter eight
[2:00:22] praise the name of Allah
[2:00:24] Romans chapter 8 and verse 35
[2:00:28] who shall separate us from the love of
[2:00:31] Christ

[2:02:19] and when you are still alive
[2:02:22] the grace of God is still available
[2:02:33] deliver me out of this I don't
[2:02:35] understand
[2:02:36] even when you don't understand the grace
[2:02:40] of God and helps you out of that stuff
[2:02:46] in Psalms 112
[2:02:49] and then verse
[2:02:57] that's the grace of God coming down when
[2:03:01] you're in darkness coming down in your
[2:03:04] condition to deliver out of that side
[2:03:09] so don't give up

[2:11:36] shall keep you
[2:11:38] the trials Temptation there is a
[2:11:42] presence of God that is in your life
[2:11:45] that you are not troubled like the rest
[2:11:47] of the world
[2:11:50] you know this week I was reading through
[2:11:52] many things that are happening which I
[2:11:54] know everywhere and then you see every
[2:11:57] place is upside down
[2:12:00] banks are becoming bankrupt in America
[2:12:05] even universities now the students are
[2:12:07] not enrolling as they used to do now
[2:12:11] then everything is like foreign
[2:12:39] together
[2:12:42] and it is the same condition in the
[2:12:45] whole world
[2:12:47] that our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:56] every country has its problems
[2:13:01] everything turning upside down
[2:13:04] so that the Earth cannot continue in its
[2:13:07] conditions
[2:13:08] then Christ comes and takes over our
[2:13:11] Christian
[2:13:12] foreign
[2:13:51] Africa
[2:13:53] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 6.
[2:13:55] he says
[2:14:02] chapter 4 verse 16 rather
[2:14:06] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[2:14:10] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[2:14:13] and find Grace to help in the time of
[2:14:18] need
[2:14:35] let us get back and read verse 14.
[2:14:39] seeing then that we have a great high
[2:14:42] priest that is passed into the heavens
[2:14:45] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[2:14:49] our professional
[2:14:55] foreign
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:44] he is touched by the feeling
[2:15:48] because he knows we are still in this
[2:15:51] bodies
[2:15:52] there are weaknesses
[2:15:54] but are you concerned
[2:15:58] that Lord I need Deliverance
[2:16:01] when the prodigal son was concerned and
[2:16:05] he went to his father the Bible says
[2:16:08] when the father saw him
[2:16:11] he ran to meet him yeah
[2:16:16] he is touched by our feelings
[2:16:24] I don't want this condition anymore
[2:16:27] what the Bible says is touched by that
[2:16:30] again why because you are now concerned
[2:16:34] when
[2:16:35] you are now saying Lord I no longer want
[2:16:39] to be
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:19] [Music]
[2:17:29] I know
[2:17:30] for we have not a high priest which
[2:17:33] cannot be touched with feeling of our
[2:17:35] infirmities but was in all points
[2:17:38] tempted like as we are yet without sins
[2:17:53] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[2:17:58] throne of grace
[2:17:59] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[2:18:03] to help in the time of need
[2:18:08] is
[2:18:17] amen praise the name of our Lord he says
[2:18:20] what we should we do according to come
[2:18:23] boldly
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:43] when we go before him
[2:18:46] when we go before him before the throne
[2:18:49] of grace the Bible says we obtain mercy
[2:18:55] and then we find Grace
[2:18:59] to help us
[2:19:04] so God has given us the grace
[2:19:08] God every other day
[2:19:10] gives us the grace to live
[2:19:16] to walk in this past
[2:19:19] to do what is right
[2:19:22] every other day
[2:19:25] like my sister here
[2:19:54] today
[2:20:02] foreign
[2:20:41] so the scripture says
[2:20:48] but it gives more grace
[2:20:51] wherefore he says God resisteth the
[2:20:55] proud but gives Grace unto the humble
[2:20:58] up
[2:21:04] Church
[2:21:19] [Music]
[2:21:31] are you
[2:21:33] weaker every morning so when the day
[2:21:36] arises
[2:21:38] there is more grace what do you
[2:21:40] expecting it praise the name of Allah
[2:21:42] yesterday he gave you Grace
[2:21:45] but today he has given you more grace
[2:21:53] he released this message but when he
[2:21:57] rose this morning
[2:22:01] even tomorrow
[2:22:09] and that's what we need to look to
[2:22:12] if you failed yesterday it is more grace
[2:22:15] for you to overcome your faith to
[2:22:19] overcome your weakness so then you don't
[2:22:22] give up continue on trusting
[2:22:26] continue on depending upon the Lord
[2:22:29] continue on calling upon the name of the
[2:22:32] Lord
[2:22:33] why he gives us more Grace
[2:22:38] I'm not looking for that of yesterday
[2:22:40] but I'm looking for the grace
[2:22:44] for today and then he has said in a fish
[2:22:47] in Hebrews chapter four and then verse
[2:22:51] 16. let us come to the throne of grace
[2:22:55] it is the throne of grace there is more
[2:22:58] grace for you
[2:23:01] there is
[2:23:03] more grace for your friends
[2:23:06] for all what you think is it possible he
[2:23:11] gives us more grace and so you come to
[2:23:14] him and high priest that is
[2:23:20] Lord I Need Your Grace
[2:23:22] Lord I Need Your Grace
[2:23:25] Lord I Need Your Grace
[2:24:25] which would still have
[2:24:30] foreign and then now when he was the
[2:24:33] team was going there
[2:24:36] the holy spirit let me start here and
[2:24:39] read it it's the message questions and
[2:24:42] answers
[2:24:44] but when I started over there
[2:24:48] the holy spirit said to me
[2:24:51] don't you do it oh it is so good to have
[2:24:55] the Holy Spirit
[2:25:04] I don't believe I want a bath this
[2:25:08] morning
[2:25:18] my one there is some big classrooms
[2:25:24] it is beautiful
[2:25:29] usually when they do they throw this
[2:25:32] water on these hot rocks
[2:25:35] and make you all steamy and beat you
[2:25:39] with leaves
[2:25:41] foreign
[2:25:53] foreign
[2:26:24] and then get back
[2:26:26] because I couldn't
[2:26:28] I was afraid to stop your heart
[2:26:32] to do that
[2:26:34] I wasn't used to it
[2:26:37] so I liked the real well but something
[2:26:42] told me not to take that one up there
[2:26:48] toward my brother
[2:26:52] Baxter and all of them going up there
[2:26:55] and Brethren all the rest of them you
[2:27:00] know all talking you know going up so I
[2:27:05] kind of got a little skittish
[2:27:10] and because the Holy Ghost said don't do
[2:27:13] that
[2:27:15] I went into a little room and sat down
[2:27:19] and there went all in the room to Andres
[2:27:27] they all went into the room to undress
[2:27:30] while they were there to Andres
[2:27:34] here come a lovely looking little finish
[2:27:37] foreign
[2:27:45] moral people as they can be
[2:27:48] here she comes the towers over her
[2:27:52] shoulder
[2:27:57] in the room I say hey stop hey I try to
[2:28:02] stop she looked around and laughed went
[2:28:06] on in there and give each of them and
[2:28:09] their men no clothes
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:12] he knew there was something wrong in
[2:28:15] that place
[2:28:16] and this is the grace that God gives us
[2:28:19] everything
[2:28:22] maybe sometimes you don't understand
[2:28:24] people
[2:28:26] somehow you find yourself you're not in
[2:28:29] their company
[2:28:31] it's the grace of God to protect you
[2:28:35] from going further with them
[2:28:39] maybe some meeting is going to do
[2:28:42] something bad about
[2:28:45] foreign
[2:29:08] praise the name of it let us go to the
[2:29:11] Book of Genesis chapter 20.
[2:29:14] and then verse three
[2:29:17] praise the name of Allah
[2:29:20] Genesis 3 Trend Genesis chapter 20 verse
[2:29:23] 3.
[2:29:26] Genesis 20 3
[2:29:29] it says but God came to ability in a
[2:29:33] Dream by night and said to him behold
[2:29:36] though at but a dead man for the woman
[2:29:39] which is thou has taken for she is a
[2:29:41] man's wife
[2:29:54] had not come near
[2:29:56] and he said Lord will those righteous
[2:30:00] Nation
[2:30:10] she is my sister and she even herself
[2:30:13] say he is my brother in the Integrity of
[2:30:16] my heart and the innocence of my hands
[2:30:19] have I done this
[2:30:22] is
[2:30:41] and God said unto him in a dream yeah I
[2:30:45] know that though did the Integrity of
[2:30:47] thy
[2:30:48] for I also withheld thee from sinning
[2:30:52] against me therefore suffered either not
[2:30:55] to touch her much
[2:31:15] praise the name of Allah
[2:31:18] because he want had an upright
[2:31:22] God would allow him to sin against him
[2:31:28] and we need to have hearts that are
[2:31:31] upright
[2:31:32] we need to be having sincere hearts
[2:31:39] motive they begin what is your intent in
[2:31:43] distress
[2:31:45] so you need to see that your heart is
[2:31:48] right
[2:31:49] you don't have something that is wrong
[2:31:52] in your house but your heart is after
[2:31:55] God and this is how God was able to come
[2:31:58] and helped
[2:32:01] praise the name of it this is how God
[2:32:04] does it the grace of God makes us to
[2:32:08] realize that we are in wrong like a soul
[2:32:13] the grace of God made him realize he was
[2:32:17] persecuting God so he was turned over
[2:32:20] the same grace of God protect us from
[2:32:25] going to do something wrong
[2:32:30] but you need to have a right heart
[2:32:33] what is in your heart are you upright in
[2:32:37] your heart are you Desiring the
[2:33:09] and this mother's name was johaden of
[2:33:13] Jerusalem
[2:33:21] and he did that which was right
[2:33:24] in the sight of the Lord but not with a
[2:33:29] perfect heart foreign
[2:33:50] [Music]
[2:33:54] it was a very dangerous condition
[2:33:57] because the Bible says it came to pass
[2:34:00] when he went into the world
[2:34:03] God gave him the victory
[2:34:05] but now when he got the victory because
[2:34:09] his heart was not perfect
[2:34:13] let us go to verse 14.
[2:34:16] and it came to pass
[2:34:53] why have you sought after the gods of
[2:34:56] the people
[2:34:58] which could not deliver their own people
[2:35:02] out of thine hands
[2:35:08] he did what was right but not with a
[2:35:12] perfect heart
[2:35:13] we need to avoid that kind of conditions
[2:35:18] we need the grace of God
[2:35:51] so God gives us Grace you know whatever
[2:35:55] thing we are going through
[2:35:57] there is Grace for you my brothers
