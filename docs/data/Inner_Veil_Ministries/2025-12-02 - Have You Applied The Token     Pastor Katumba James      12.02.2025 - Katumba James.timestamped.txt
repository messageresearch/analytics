[25:52] today praise the name of our
[25:56] Lord let us offer word of
[25:59] prayer father in the name of our Lord
[26:02] Jesus
[26:03] Christ we thank you for this
[26:06] evening the grace that you've given un
[26:09] us
[26:10] father that we can come into your
[26:12] presence
[26:13] Lord you said where three are gathered
[26:16] in your
[26:17] name you will be there in their
[26:20] mid and Lord we believe you're here in
[26:22] our
[26:23] midst therefore we pray you may speak to
[26:26] us father
[26:28] and give us understanding of your
[26:31] word that we may receive that
[26:35] transformation and be able to be like
[26:37] our Lord Jesus Christ May bless us this
[26:40] night father and are all our prayers
[26:44] request here all our prayer
[26:49] request
[26:51] glorified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:55] us amen let us go to Exodus CH
[27:01] 12 and then we're reading
[27:07] verse so the Bible
[27:10] says and the blood shall be unto you for
[27:14] a token upon the houses where you are
[27:18] and when I see the blood I will pass
[27:21] over you and the plague shall not be
[27:23] upon you to destroy you when I smite the
[27:27] land
[27:40] [Music]
[27:49] word
[27:52] May so I want to to take some bit of
[27:56] time and Minister on have you applied
[27:59] the
[28:06] token praise the name of our Lord now
[28:09] here the Bible
[28:11] says the blood shall be to you for a
[28:18] token that when I see the
[28:22] blood I pass over
[28:25] you and the plague shall not be upon on
[28:28] you to destroy
[28:31] you when I smite the land of
[28:36] Egypt so we see this was an evening
[28:40] time when the children of Israel Were
[28:43] Meant to leave
[28:47] Egypt and the Lord wanted to bring
[28:51] judgment upon the houses of the
[28:55] Egyptians but then the children of
[28:57] Israel
[28:59] they were still in
[29:05] egpt the name of our Lord the same thing
[29:08] also to
[29:09] us that we are still living in this
[29:14] world we are still living in the world
[29:16] that is having a lot of evil
[29:21] things but while we are living in the
[29:24] world there must be a difference
[29:29] between
[29:30] us and then the other
[29:33] people there must be a
[29:35] difference between us who have received
[29:38] the
[29:39] message and even those who have not
[29:41] received the
[29:43] message there must be a
[29:46] token something that brings forth a
[29:51] difference something that distinc fies
[29:56] us you know to show that God has called
[30:02] us God saved
[30:04] us praise the name of our so Moses was
[30:09] telling the children of
[30:12] Israel that you you will have to apply
[30:15] the
[30:18] blood but then the blood could not be
[30:22] applied without a lamp being slain
[30:28] praise the name of our Lord the same
[30:30] thing also for
[30:32] us we can never apply the
[30:36] token if there was no death of Jesus
[30:40] Christ in the Old
[30:42] Testament blood was animal
[30:47] blood but now in the New
[30:50] Testament the blood is the blood of God
[30:54] himself praise the name of the Lord
[30:58] blood of God that was
[31:02] applied go to the book of
[31:07] Acts and then verse
[31:11] 28 the scripture
[31:14] says take he therefore unto yourselves
[31:17] andto all the flock over which the Holy
[31:20] Ghost has made you over seers to feed
[31:23] the Church of God which he has purchased
[31:25] with his own blood
[31:43] so he says that we were purchased by the
[31:46] blood of
[31:49] God so we are totally different from
[31:52] what happened in the Old Testament
[31:58] praise the name of our Lord because we
[32:00] see that the blood applied in the Old
[32:06] Testament they had to continuously keep
[32:08] on applying the
[32:13] blood of different
[32:16] animals you know to they kill an
[32:20] animal and then they have the morning
[32:22] sacrifice and the evening
[32:24] sacrifice even the following another
[32:27] animal
[32:29] until the end
[32:31] of much as they applied the token in the
[32:34] Old
[32:37] Testament it only helped them at that
[32:42] time like when the death angel was
[32:44] passing over the land of
[32:49] Egypt that blood helped them at that
[32:55] season but then when they crossed the
[32:58] Red
[32:59] Sea they needed to keep on applying the
[33:06] blood praise the name of our Lord then
[33:09] we have the blood of Jesus
[33:12] Christ and then the Bible says he has
[33:16] applied his he has offered as a
[33:21] sacrifice once and for
[33:25] all praise the name of the Lord so it is
[33:28] the same blood of Jesus
[33:31] Christ which saves us is the same blood
[33:35] of Jesus
[33:36] Christ that brings us to
[33:40] Perfection praise the name of the Lord
[33:43] so now in the Old
[33:45] Testament the blood was applied upon the
[33:49] doorsteps on the door
[33:53] flame let us go to Exodus 12
[33:59] praise the name of our
[34:03] Lord Exodus
[34:06] 12 and then it says verse S and they
[34:10] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[34:13] the two sides of the posts and on the
[34:16] upper door post of the houses wherein
[34:19] they shall eat it
[34:37] so now they were applying the blood on
[34:40] the
[34:42] doors on the upper part of the
[34:46] flame and then even on the two
[34:49] sides but now we apply the blood of
[34:52] Jesus
[34:54] Christ we apply to our soul
[34:59] we app in our
[35:02] hearts by
[35:04] faith praise the name of our Lord apply
[35:08] that blood in our
[35:11] hearts praise the name of our Lord now
[35:14] in the message
[35:16] token he says now our sacrifice
[35:21] today not not only an ordinary human
[35:25] being
[35:28] but it was God
[35:31] himself I think if you can adjust the
[35:34] voice it was God
[35:38] himself that was identified in the flesh
[35:42] here upon the
[35:45] Earth but that blood cell was
[35:52] broke not only did the soul of not only
[35:56] did the soul of a man
[36:01] the spirit of
[36:03] man but God
[36:06] himself who was identified in that
[36:11] man returns
[36:16] upon in the baptism of the holy
[36:24] spirit that is the
[36:26] token that God requires
[36:30] today the token of
[36:32] today that we have to
[36:36] have must be the holy
[36:40] spirit that is God that's God required
[36:46] token prove to you by the
[36:51] scriptures without the Holy
[36:54] Spirit you do not display the token
[36:59] that is the
[37:00] token shows that you have you have
[37:03] identified yourself with the
[37:09] sacrif and God sent you back the
[37:14] token to show that you have been
[37:20] accepted until that is
[37:22] done no matter how good you are
[37:28] how much you
[37:30] know how a college professor or a good
[37:32] person or
[37:35] preacher whatever it might
[37:38] be you are absolutely not

[53:19] how we need to see that we apply the
[53:24] token going after all the
[53:27] people and then bringing them into
[53:31] the praise the name of our Lord can now
[53:34] look at different tokens in the
[53:39] scriptures now when we go to Genesis
[53:45] chapter
[53:49] 11se the B says and I establish my
[53:53] Covenant with you neither shall all
[53:56] flesh be cut off anymore By the Waters
[53:59] of a flood neither shall there anymore
[54:03] be of a flood to destroy them and God
[54:05] said this is the token of the Covenant
[54:08] which I make between me and you and
[54:10] every living creature that
[54:14] is Generation
[54:32] so
[55:02] I do set my in the cloud and it shall be
[55:06] for a token of a covenant between me and
[55:09] the
[55:18] Earth so now God was talking to
[55:22] Noah and he said that I will never
[55:25] destroy the Earth
[55:29] by a
[55:30] FL and so he said I will put a
[55:35] token and that token was a
[55:39] rainbow and then he says when I see the
[55:42] rainbow in the
[55:45] sky then I will remember my
[55:50] Covenant that I'm not going to
[55:54] destroy praise the name of
[55:57] Earth by the
[56:00] flood so a
[56:02] token is a confirmation of the
[56:07] Covenant praise the name of our Lord
[56:10] token confirms the
[56:13] Covenant now we see in the message
[56:18] toen then brother Bram
[56:21] says and if he has G you the baptism of
[56:25] the Holy Ghost
[56:29] yet then okay says and if he has never G
[56:32] you the baptism of the Holy
[56:35] Ghost yet then he has not confirmed your
[56:42] faith that you say you
[56:45] have but the
[56:48] token is the
[56:51] confir praise the name of our Lord the
[56:54] confirmation of our salvation
[57:02] toen that we have been
[57:05] redeemed praise the name of our Lord the
[57:08] proof that the price has been
[57:12] paid and then he says when I show when I
[57:16] saw the
[57:18] token I got a
[57:21] right and when I can show the token of
[57:24] the Holy Spirit
[57:27] you got the right to any purchased

[58:20] word hold the token over the promised
[58:23] word and walk right to it

[58:34] transgressions with stripes I was
[58:38] healed take my
[58:40] token of the holy spirit that is in
[58:45] me hold it over my
[58:49] prayer and say Lord

[59:03] blood I will reward you you promise to
[59:07] do it you can't do nothing
[59:11] else he look right through the blood of
[59:14] his own
[59:18] son is the
[59:20] token praise the name of the Lord there
[59:23] is the token applied
[59:27] he has to do it because he promised
[59:31] it praise the name of the Lord we need

[1:00:05] this you use the
[1:00:08] token praise the name of Lord then again

[1:00:20] token is the confirmation of his word
[1:00:26] that shows he is the

[1:01:22] our
[1:01:23] needs let us apply the token
[1:01:27] praise the name of our Lord and then you
[1:01:29] see how the Lord goes for to bring those
[1:01:31] things that we have
[1:01:35] desired praise the name of our Lord let
[1:01:38] us go to Genesis
[1:01:41] 1 and then verse
[1:01:44] 11 he says and you shall circumcise the
[1:01:48] Flesh of yourin and it shall be a token
[1:01:51] of the Covenant between me and you
[1:02:06] and he that is 8 years old shall be
[1:02:08] circumcised among you every man child in
[1:02:12] your Generations he that is born in the
[1:02:14] house or bought with money of any
[1:02:18] stranger which is not of thy
[1:02:23] seed first
[1:02:50] and he that is born in thy house and he
[1:02:53] that bought with money must needs be
[1:02:56] circumcised and my Covenant shall be in
[1:02:58] your flesh for an Everlasting
[1:03:22] Covenant and uncircumcised men child
[1:03:26] whose flesh of his for skin is not
[1:03:28] circumcised that Soul shall be cut off
[1:03:31] from his people he has broken myen
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:04:02] praise the name of our Lord God was
[1:04:06] Abraham that every man child of your
[1:04:13] household
[1:04:16] yours the
[1:04:18] slaves all of them have to be
[1:04:23] circumcised so that you know they are
[1:04:25] all all part of the Covenant of
[1:04:29] God and that should also be our desire
[1:04:32] for our
[1:04:36] household the people that we live
[1:04:40] with let us bring them under the the
[1:04:45] token praise the name of our Lord let
[1:04:48] them be part of the
[1:04:51] houseold protection of God
[1:04:55] mercies of
[1:04:58] God tell them about the way of the
[1:05:03] Lord teach them the word of
[1:05:06] God praise the name of that's how you
[1:05:09] bring them under the
[1:05:12] token that they may know what you
[1:05:16] believe you know the Bible tells us that
[1:05:19] we should be ready to
[1:05:23] testify when people ask us what we
[1:05:27] so you should also be ready to talk
[1:05:29] about what you

[1:05:39] them into the way of the
[1:05:42] Lord praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:05:45] also look at another
[1:05:48] one in Exodus chapter
[1:05:52] 3 and then verse 11 verse 12
[1:05:59] and Moses said unto God whom am I that I
[1:06:03] should go un pharaoh and that I should
[1:06:05] bring forth the children of Israel out
[1:06:08] of Egypt and he said certainly I will be
[1:06:11] with thee and this shall be a token unto
[1:06:14] thee that I have sent thee when thou
[1:06:18] Hast brought forth the people out of
[1:06:20] Egypt You Shall Serve God upon this
[1:06:24] mountain
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:52] praise the name of our Lord so God was
[1:06:54] telling Moses
[1:06:57] that the
[1:06:58] toen a proof that I'm sending
[1:07:01] you because he was talking to him when
[1:07:04] he so Moses was seeing it was a big
[1:07:07] challenge before
[1:07:11] him he's here alone talking with
[1:07:14] God he had run away from
[1:07:17] Egypt fearing PHA and now here after 40
[1:07:22] years God is telling go and bring my
[1:07:28] people Andes
[1:07:31] asual was wonder how is this going to
[1:07:37] be you know the same thing like
[1:07:41] Nicodemus
[1:07:43] when unless a man is born
[1:07:48] again he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:07:52] of
[1:07:53] God and then say how can these things
[1:07:59] be can I enter my mother's womb and be
[1:08:02] born
[1:08:05] again so his natural understanding is
[1:08:09] only from the wom of a
[1:08:17] mother but then the Lord
[1:08:20] him
[1:08:22] another the name of Lord doesn't come by
[1:08:26] the natural
[1:08:30] instruments but then it comes by the
[1:08:34] superal praise the name of our Lord and
[1:08:37] so here God was telling
[1:08:40] Moses that the token to prove that I
[1:08:42] have sent
[1:08:44] you you are going to come back to this
[1:08:48] mountain with all the children of

[1:11:00] 8
[1:11:04] ver praise the name of our
[1:11:12] Lord numbers 17:8 ver 10 it says and it
[1:11:17] came to pass that on the morrow Moses
[1:11:19] went into the Tabernacle of the witness
[1:11:22] and behold the road of Aaron for the
[1:11:25] House of Levi was bed and brought forth
[1:11:28] birds and blossomed blossoms and yielded
[1:11:32] almonds
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:21] and Moses brought out all the roads from
[1:12:23] before the Lord and to all the children
[1:12:26] of Israel and they looked and took every
[1:12:28] man his road and the Lord said unto
[1:12:31] Moses bring aon's Rod again before the
[1:12:35] testimony to be kept for a token against
[1:12:38] the rebels and thou shall quite take
[1:12:41] away their Mings from me that they die
[1:12:45] not
[1:13:07] praise the name of our Lord so here when
[1:13:09] there were dispute among the children of
[1:13:14] Israel God told
[1:13:17] Moses take a road from every leader of
[1:13:20] each
[1:13:23] tribe and then they were brought in the
[1:13:27] they were brought in the holies of
[1:13:31] holies and all the roads
[1:13:36] nevered except thead
[1:13:39] ofon which actually
[1:13:43] blossomed and then it even put on
[1:13:47] alms praise the name of our Lord and
[1:13:50] then God said this should be now a token
[1:13:55] that Aon has been
[1:13:58] chosen the tribe of Levi has been
[1:14:03] chosen that it should be able to quien
[1:14:06] these
[1:14:09] people you to make them quiet from their
[1:14:13] mming so quit from their
[1:14:17] mming and know that this
[1:14:20] one is the chosen of the
[1:14:23] Lord praise the name of
[1:14:26] God used
[1:14:27] the the life in the
[1:14:32] road as a
[1:14:34] token as a
[1:14:36] proof that this is acceptable of the
[1:14:42] Lord the other road which
[1:14:45] never it meant that those are not
[1:14:48] acceptable in the services of the
[1:14:52] Lord in other words they were not
[1:14:54] ordained
[1:14:57] to do the service of the
[1:15:02] priesthood the name of our so God had
[1:15:05] put there a
[1:15:06] token so we see also see that when the
[1:15:10] 12 Spies went to when the spies went
[1:15:14] when the three spies went to to
[1:15:19] Jero they went into the house of
[1:15:23] Rahab and Rahab was said that the whole
[1:15:25] country is
[1:15:28] trembling and then she told him as I've
[1:15:31] shown you
[1:15:33] kindness you also need to show me
[1:15:37] kindness praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:40] believed them and so now they had to
[1:15:43] make a SC
[1:15:48] threat put a scared thread in the one of
[1:15:51] the the windows outside of the city
[1:15:58] window which this used to go down the
[1:16:04] city so when we see that in J
[1:16:08] 2 and then
[1:16:11] verse he says now therefore I pray swear
[1:16:16] unto me by the Lord since I've shown you
[1:16:19] kindness that you will also show
[1:16:21] kindness unto my father's house and give
[1:16:24] give me a true
[1:16:32] token chter 2 vers 12
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:13] so she was demanding give me a
[1:17:17] token something to show that I'm going
[1:17:20] to be
[1:17:22] safe when the destruction comes on the
[1:17:26] city I will be
[1:17:29] safe praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:32] remember that in the book of
[1:17:35] eel when the angel when the the inkman
[1:17:39] was told Mark them that cry and against
[1:17:41] the abomination of the
[1:17:47] city when struction went
[1:17:52] forth was told don't go to those people
[1:17:54] people who have been
[1:17:59] marked prise
[1:18:01] the so we need the
[1:18:04] token to make
[1:18:08] us you know to make us
[1:18:12] different from the rest of the people of
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:16] world to escape the Judgment that are
[1:18:19] coming upon
[1:18:21] Earth praise the name of our Lord and
[1:18:23] then the SP
[1:18:26] RAB put that Scarlet cloth on the
[1:18:33] window when we
[1:18:36] come and then we see
[1:18:39] that in 2
[1:18:47] ver let us start from verse 17 and the
[1:18:51] man said unto her we will be blameless
[1:18:54] of this thine oath which thou Hast made
[1:18:56] us to swear behold when we come into the
[1:18:59] land Thou shalt bind this line of
[1:19:02] scarlet thread in the window which thou
[1:19:06] did let us down by and thou shalt bring
[1:19:10] thy father and thy mother and thy
[1:19:13] Brethren and all thy father's household
[1:19:16] home unto thee
[1:19:36] a
[1:20:04] praise the name of our Lord so she
[1:20:07] demanded a true
[1:20:10] token and the true token was given to
[1:20:14] her God has also given us a true
[1:20:18] token which is the baptism of the holy
[1:20:21] spirit so now when the spies were when
[1:20:23] the Joshua came to take over the
[1:20:27] city the Bible says in joshu
[1:20:32] 6 and then verse
[1:20:35] 25 and Joshua saved Rahab the harot
[1:20:39] alive and her father's household and all
[1:20:42] that she had and she dwelleth in Israel
[1:20:45] even unto this day because she hid The
[1:20:48] Messengers which Joshua sent to spy out
[1:20:52] Jericho Joshua 6:25
[1:21:19] is
[1:21:35] praise the name of the Lord Raab applied
[1:21:38] the token for her
[1:21:42] household we need also to do the same
[1:21:44] thing for our
[1:21:45] household we need to apply the token for
[1:21:48] our
[1:21:49] Liv and also apply the token for our
[1:21:52] household
[1:21:55] in the message
[1:21:57] adoption brother Bram
[1:21:59] says I want to say this one
[1:22:03] thing did you ever read in the
[1:22:05] scriptures where the Bible said
[1:22:10] this Paul told the Roman
[1:22:15] Centurion when he pulled when the Roman
[1:22:18] he pulled his sword to kill
[1:22:23] himself up at
[1:22:26] Philip when he was in
[1:22:30] jail and the earthquake shook the jail
[1:22:36] down he said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:22:40] Christ and thy house thy and thy house
[1:22:45] shall be
[1:22:47] saved did you ever hear
[1:22:50] that th and thy house
[1:22:54] now
[1:22:55] look if you have faith enough for
[1:22:58] salvation of
[1:23:02] yourself can't you also have faith
[1:23:04] enough for your
[1:23:08] house praise the name of the Lord in
[1:23:11] other words the faith that has saved
[1:23:15] you the faith that has saved
[1:23:18] you is the same Faith you use
[1:23:24] are praying for your
[1:23:26] children when you are praying for your
[1:23:29] parents claiming them for their
[1:23:35] salvation that's what Paul ising
[1:23:40] the he says you and your house shall be
[1:23:45] saved so you apply the same
[1:23:50] faith believing in
[1:23:52] God that he will save your children
[1:23:55] children praise the name of then he
[1:23:59] says God God in
[1:24:04] tonight that every
[1:24:09] child and their
[1:24:12] children will all be in that glorious
[1:24:16] Happy
[1:24:22] Land where there is no sickness so old
[1:24:25] age of
[1:24:28] Sorrow may they receive
[1:24:31] this and may all of her
[1:24:35] children and her
[1:24:37] husband and all her loved
[1:24:40] ones and all that love
[1:24:43] her and all that she
[1:24:45] loves may they be there with her in the
[1:24:48] name of Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ that's how brother Bram was
[1:24:53] praying for this sister called
[1:24:57] so now if the grace of God has come down
[1:24:59] to
[1:25:01] us the same Grace that has saved
[1:25:04] us we need to see that it goes out to
[1:25:07] our
[1:25:10] household to your children to your
[1:25:13] parents to your friends to your
[1:25:16] relatives to your colleagues to your
[1:25:21] neighbors you need to live a right kind
[1:25:23] of life
[1:25:26] and then you need to pray for
[1:25:29] God that God May deliver
[1:25:32] them God May save them you keep on
[1:25:36] praying to God about
[1:25:38] them mentioning
[1:25:41] them Name by
[1:25:44] name praise the name of our Lord you
[1:25:47] mention the name of your
[1:25:48] son you mention the name of your parents
[1:25:52] you mention the name of your daughter
[1:25:54] mention the name of your friends and
[1:25:57] claim them praise the name of our Lord
[1:26:01] that the Lord can bring them into
[1:26:04] salvation praise the name of the Lord in
[1:26:06] the message token he
[1:26:08] says we must believe for
[1:26:16] our they did down in
[1:26:19] Egypt and also for the house
[1:26:24] like they did in
[1:26:26] Egypt and Jero and so
[1:26:29] forth and we find
[1:26:31] out I got a scripture WR
[1:26:35] here 16
[1:26:39] ver1 where the Roman centuri was to take
[1:26:42] his own
[1:26:45] life and he was going to stab himself to
[1:26:49] death and Pa told him believe on the
[1:26:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] and thy and thy house shall be
[1:26:59] saved it is go to be a
[1:27:06] houseold what made so many little
[1:27:09] kids what made so many women on the
[1:27:21] street what makes so much juvenile
[1:27:23] delence
[1:27:31] because we are not able to get our
[1:27:33] household under the
[1:27:39] blood praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:27:42] need to see that we bring our
[1:27:46] household under the blood of Jesus
[1:27:49] Christ apply the
[1:27:52] token praise the name of our Lord
[1:27:54] now let us finish with Romans chapter
[1:27:58] 1 Romans chapter 1 and verse
[1:28:04] 9 he
[1:28:05] says for God is my witness whom I serve
[1:28:09] with my spirit in the gospel of his son
[1:28:12] and without ceasing I make mention of
[1:28:15] you always in my prayers
[1:28:29] he says I make mention of you
[1:28:35] always in my
[1:28:37] prayers that's how we need to claim our
[1:28:41] people continue praying to
[1:28:44] God mentioning them in
[1:28:48] prayers demanding them that Satan may
[1:28:52] lose them
[1:28:54] that Satan may get away from their
[1:28:58] lives Satan may stop influencing
[1:29:01] them that they may have a personal
[1:29:03] relationship with
[1:29:07] God praise the name of our Lord verse
[1:29:11] 10 making request if by any means now at
[1:29:15] length I might have a prosperous journey
[1:29:18] by the will of God to come unto you
[1:29:41] for I long to see you that I may impart
[1:29:44] unto you some spiritual gift to the end
[1:29:47] you may be established
[1:29:59] praise the name of the Lord so Paul had
[1:30:02] Assurance he had a spiritual
[1:30:06] gift and then he said I want to impart
[1:30:09] my spiritual
[1:30:13] gift to
[1:30:16] you so that you may be
[1:30:19] established and if we have the
[1:30:22] token praise the name Lord we can use
[1:30:26] this
[1:30:27] token we can impart the
[1:30:30] token to influence
[1:30:32] others to turn to the way of the
[1:30:36] Lord and then the Bible says when they
[1:30:39] see your good
[1:30:42] works then they will turn to the
[1:30:45] Lord they will glorify the
[1:30:48] Lord like the other woman who had a
[1:30:50] drunk husband
[1:30:54] she imparted her spiritual
[1:31:01] gift which was
[1:31:06] salvation to turn the husband and her
[1:31:09] friends to the Lord
[1:31:11] Jesus and the Bible also tells us that
[1:31:15] if women have husbands who are not
[1:31:20] believer let us go to First Peter
[1:31:22] chapter 3
[1:31:27] and then verse
[1:31:30] one likewise ye wives be in subjection
[1:31:34] to your own husbands that if any obey
[1:31:37] not the word they also May without the
[1:31:41] word be warned by the conversation of
[1:31:43] the wives
[1:32:05] while they behold your chest
[1:32:06] conversation coupled with
[1:32:15] fear praise the name of our Lord he says
[1:32:18] you can win your
[1:32:21] husband to turn to Christ
[1:32:25] by your
[1:32:27] conduct praise the name of Lord you are
[1:32:30] imparting to
[1:32:32] them that which you have received from
[1:32:35] the
[1:32:36] Lord and you are using what God has
[1:32:38] given
[1:32:39] you that you can bring them into the
[1:32:42] fold of Jesus
[1:32:44] Christ praise the name of our Lord we
[1:32:47] need to apply the
[1:32:49] token let us apply the token in our
[1:32:52] lives
[1:32:54] let us apply the token to our
[1:32:57] families let us apply the
[1:33:00] token praise the name of where we work
[1:33:04] in our
[1:33:05] neighborhoods to our friends to our
[1:33:09] families that they can come to
[1:33:12] Christ but you can only apply the token
[1:33:15] to
[1:33:18] them if you have the token
[1:33:21] already said that I May impart my
[1:33:24] spiritual gift to
[1:33:28] you pra the name of Lord because he knew
[1:33:31] was
[1:33:33] gifted like brother Bram talks about
[1:33:37] Paul and they were taking clothes from
[1:33:40] the body of
[1:33:43] Paul and then when they lay on the sick
[1:33:46] they would
[1:33:49] recover and brother says
[1:33:54] that he has power on
[1:33:58] him so he was using that Old Testament
[1:34:01] scripture of
[1:34:05] Elijah that when Elijah The Other Woman
[1:34:09] told him that son is dead
[1:34:24] praise the name of the Lord there
[1:34:26] something God has given
[1:34:28] you that you can use to impart
[1:34:33] on praise the name of the
[1:34:35] Lord to
[1:34:38] church each of us has come with this
[1:34:42] token
[1:34:44] theil stand before
[1:34:46] us when each of us has applied the
[1:34:50] token we have come with our leaks of

[1:35:05] strong the sick will come out when they
[1:35:07] are
[1:35:09] healed the Sinners will come out when
[1:35:11] they are convicted and they
[1:35:15] Sav prise the name of the Lord we need
[1:35:18] to apply the
[1:35:20] token praise the name of our Lord at our
[1:35:23] homes
[1:35:24] where we work in whatever that we may be
