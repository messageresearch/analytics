Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; While we are standing by, &gt;&gt; lest our heads not open. Father, &gt;&gt; this morning we realize that we are a brotherhood. &gt;&gt; It's impossible, heavenly father, for us to part from one another. We've been bound into one by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. So Lord, we come before your presence in this kind of oneness that you may speak to us as a body. Encourage us as a body. Father, as we draw before your presence, we pray that you may look at all our cares and concerns and address them ever further. We need thee now. than ever before. As the hour is first spent and one of these days, time will face into eternity. Help us Lord to live our lives like a men that are desiring for the coming of Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So we shall go to the scripture reading and we trust that the Lord will be gracious to us. 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 29. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. We are talking about the discerning of the Lord's body. So I'm going to take this service and I'm putting it on the preaching of stability. So it's preaching stability and the title is autoimmunity. Have you ever seen a body fight itself? It would be very pathetic. You try a slap on your face. Not just by touching. It's practically impossible. So I'm preaching stability and the title is autoimmunity. You may be seated. I think you know autoimmunity is selfdestruction of the body. Um I think I would rather use the word you know, use your teeth on your body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And try to pull a punch a chunk of your your your your flesh. &gt;&gt; So that's how unnatural autoimmunity is. So I'm taking a quote here from discerning the body of the lord where brotherham says I wonder sometimes if we can discern right from wrong for our own bodies. Amen. Especially the Lord's body. We don't discern right from wrong from our own bodies. And week after week, month after month and year after year, science work in the laboratories and set great big scriptures and everything and advertisements and warns people. Cancer by the cattle. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know they announce cancer by the curtains. Movie two men 27 something thousand Americans will die this year from smoking cigarettes and you smoke cigarettes right we can't even discern our own bodies let alone discerning the Holy Spirit Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the body of the church. So, brother Bra has got a concern that we are a people that even don't understand how important this our bodies are that regardless of what the doctor say the people continue smoking. People continue drinking. People continue with feeding habits that are not good. And he says the same way we fail to discern the Holy Spirit in the body of the church. Amen. So the question here is if we cannot discern what is good for our natural bodies, can we be able to discern what's good for the body of the church? You see, many people get sick and die for failing to discern what's good for their natural bodies. Then they suffer from cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, different diseases. And in the spiritual body too, we can hit a snack in life because we fail to discern the Lord's body. Amen. Amen. You look at your brother And you just look at him as a man we go to church together. &gt;&gt; But this man here is a tabernacle of the living God. That's the way you should look at him. Don't look at him as a man who goes to the same church with only that he sits on the other side and therefore we are not close to one another. The prophet says here in the message God using his gift and he gave his life his blood that the sexual born people could come back into fellowship. Are you together with me? That these people here can come back in [Music] with him and be part of him. So it's God not in a pillar of fire, not God in Christ. It's in you. You need to change the way you look and at God. Don't look at God like the God that was leading the children of Israel in the wilderness by a pillar of fire. Don't look at God by looking at him in the body of Christ. He says you need to look at God, the one who dwells in us. that when you see me, you are seeing a portion of God. Amen. Amen. All that God was, he poured into Christ. In him drove the fullness of the Godhead. And all that God was in Christ, he poured into the church. Amen. So now you are part of God. One time Christ was the Godhead bond. But when he went and took glory and he poured back his spirit into the church body and now the body of the church is the fullness of the god body. So when I'm talking about recognizing the body of Christ, I'm talking about recognizing the brotherhood, that we are one, that we are a family. Amen. We are united together by one spirit. So now look at it by recognizing your body. Amen. By recognizing, say, for example, your brother and his position in the body, you are rightly discerning the Lord's body. Because you understand your brother, by who he is. Last time when I was here, I was dealing with the subject of who am I? Amen. So these men here who knew John by name, they went out to John and said, "Who are you?" Meaning that who are you? Amen. In the body of Christ. And so when they knew John, they knew him by his position in the body. We need to recognize one another. Amen. how important we are in the body of Christ, we can be blessed in these things. If we can be able to look beyond the natural, see God in each other. Amen. Amen. And because our bodies are naturally real, you know this body here is real. This body here is not a vis. Are you together with me? Then say amen. Yeah, this body here is not this. It's a natural reality. It's not an imitation. So God uses these bodies to teach the relationship between you and your brother in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So those that are genuinely baptized by the Holy Ghost, they make the body of Christ which is more real than this body here. Are you together with me? So in the natural let me say this in your natural setup [Music] you as a man or a woman if one leg is hurt. You don't desire the other leg to be hurt also so that it may go so that it may not go into blame game because you are walking and then you hurt your leg. You wouldn't want this leg to be hurt. But naturally sometimes in our walk in church if this leg is hurt sometimes this leg here which is hurt would start to say this other body here is going to blame me. This leg is going to blame me. I wish this leg also get hurt. Sometimes that's how we think in church. We come back and then when God is putting us on the spot, you just said the woman you gather, you enter into blame game. But in the body which is a reality if this hand here is hurt this hand here will come to protect the heart which has been hurt. Are you together with me? So the body is built in such a way that its members work in honor for each other. Amen. And they work in synchronization. Amen. You see, there is no member that will do not go to protect another man. Praise the Lord. If you fall, then your hands, the hands will move try to support the part which is hurt. There is no debate. There's no meeting which is s among the members of the body that this part here should agree and help the other part but because they are one every member of the body moves in support of the other. Amen. And this is the kind of church that I try to look at. church which realizes we are a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now your body has many members that must work together under the command of one intelligence. The mind commands the body and all the parts of the body are subject to one mind. And that's why Paul says to the church of Corinth that as a body we all have the same mind. Amen. to be connected to the mind of Christ to think like a Christ to judge like a Christ and therefore act like amen is the mind and the natural movement of the body of Christ here on earth. Amen. That's how we can be a strong local church. Amen. We can't be members of the local church and distance ourselves from our responsibility. If there is anything in church, that must be done. You said that must be done by me. I love strong. Amen. I can hear you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's very important for us to subject ourselves &gt;&gt; to the leadership of that supernatural man because that supernatural man works in every member of the body. Amen. That's the way you know the church moves under the same intelligence. which is Christ. Let this mind be you which was in Christ Jesus. If the mind of Christ is in this individual in that individual in that individual together which makes us the body of Christ. Amen. So 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 15 he says if the foot shall say because I am not in the hand I am not of the body. Is it therefore not of the body simply because it's not the other part of the body? If I'm not the pastor, therefore I'm not part of the body. Are you together with me? He's trying to make us understand the spiritual body, the church. And if the ear shall say, because I'm not the eye, I am not of the body. Is it therefore not of the body? &gt;&gt; If the body were annihil [Music] because I'm not the heart then I am not of the the the body. And then the the eye says because I'm not the ear then I'm not part of the body. So Paul said then if the whole body amen was one part then where would the hearing be? If the war here is where the smelling, we cannot be the same in the body of Christ. And whatsoever we are, we must accept, we must appreciate. And you that looks at me as a different part of the body, you must honor me because I'm necessary in the absence of the eye, then the whole body cannot move. But now verse 18, God set the members of every one of them in the body. As it pleased him, in order not to please you, but as it pleased him, as it pleased God, he made him an interpreter. As it pleased God, it made brother God. He made brother to be a deacon. He pleased God. He makes to become a song. He has made you what you are. So that the body must move. as a component. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. The functioning of the natural body literally teaches us that though we being many are one body that must be driven by the same mind. This mind is the mind of Christ. Christ &gt;&gt; is the intelligence &gt;&gt; to the church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. He says, "Let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus. Let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus. Then in the next verse, Paul describes the mind which was in Christ and it was the mind of humility. Are you together with me? Let this mind be you. a mind of humility to accept what God has made you work as God has allowed you to work. He says, "Who being in the form of God, count it not to be equal to God." But Jesus made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant. and was made in the likeness of men. That's what the mind made Christ. It helped him to humble himself in the position that God had ordained him for. Amen. He made himself of no reputation when he condescended from Elohim and then come down into Logos. for him to create. And when we see the same Christ, God sends himself again takes the body of flesh to perform the redemption. That's the mind that will bring the body together. Amen. So I believe that we are living in a great uniting time, a time of rededication, uniting with the full body of Christ, being ready for the rapture. This is the time we are living in. It's a uniting time. It's not a separating time. It's a time for the body to come together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. This is the time of the restoration. Amen. If we can go to Ezekiel 37 to bring together the dry bones, the voice of the rapture spoken to those bones. Then the bones came back to norm shoulder bone the shoulders elbow elbow. Everything coming in its own place and the purpose of this message is to speak you into your position in the body. Who am I? Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 12:16, &gt;&gt; he says, "Be of the same mind, one towards another, if you refuse, then you are not subject to the mind. But if we be subject to the mind, &gt;&gt; the mind is telling us we should be of the same mind. Mind not high things. But condescent to men of low estate. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you're not to condescend and come down. and have fellowship with men of low esteem who also part of the body. That's what Christ does. He condescended himself came into the body of flesh and put his tent next to that one of Peter and James had a personal fellowship. That's what God wants among us. God said to men of lowest hallelujah that among us there would be no clash but to be a brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our desires man towards the head. Amen. So we are projecting out from the wider structure base. Amen. Because when you know the pyramid in itself, it's a very big base. But as it keeps growing, it gets narrower. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You throw away so many things because you are cing into the coming of the Lord. You want to drop your mind, you need to drop your pride, you need to drop the uh control, your status so that you can grow together as a church to be of the same man until we connect to the headship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So to be of the same mind means that be connected to Christ individually thinking by the same word. Let this mind be you as an individual. the mind of Christ that puts down our pride, that puts down the competition, puts down the fact. If this mind is in you and the same mind is in me, we are going to have a body. Amen. Because we see nothing but Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must remind ourselves of how God wants to bring us into the same man. He has his order always. He has the flow of command. Because every body, every member of the body has got a special commission. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has a special commission. So Christ is the headship of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not our own but we are his yield to him and him alone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let me take you to first Corinthians here so that you may be able to understand what I mean. I'm talking about a body. Now the easiest way to recognize me is by the headship. If this head is not part of my body, who may know me? but the identity is with head. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is where God has placed the mind. Upon the head is where he has put the vision. upon the head is where he has put the ear. But if God has speak I'll hear if God has to direct me. I have the vision head is very important. We need to be connected to the head because that's the flow of command in the intelligence in the mind Christ himself from the head to the body. If this part of me is cut then the mind has no connection to the body. If this part of my hand is cut off, are you together with me? If my body gets a direction from the mind that begin to run away, this part that is cut off will not respond. Is not connected to the head. Somebody say amen. Now I know you're there. So 1 Corinthians 11:3, but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God. And so for this scripture, I've always taken you back to creation that when God created, &gt;&gt; he made a coke and a chicken. [Laughter] [Music] Praise the Lord. [Music] Praise the Lord. He makes a ha. That's what God used to do. But when he comes to Adam, he makes one like he was one, but yet on the inside, they had a bride that needed to be revealed after Adam had got the mind of the Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God did He told Adam &gt;&gt; that come over here. &gt;&gt; Okay, Adam, &gt;&gt; I want you to name all these animals. And then Adam, as the animals passed through, he kept calling them by name. And for all the animals, Adam was right. Amen. And the scripture says whatever Adam called them that was the name thereof. Amen. Not that Adam named them. But Adam got into the mind of God and he was able to tell the names of the names of the reptiles, the names of the init, the names of the B. Are you together with me? So where did that understanding come? That understanding come from the head. Amen. left this mind which was also in Christ Jesus which came from the headship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why here he says I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ. Now the headship here is the source of information is the source of understanding is the source of intelligence. [Applause] So God puts the order here as God and the mind of God works in Christ and then the mind of Christ works in the man. And the mind of a man controls the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bride therefore is controlled by the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why in order to say how can such a man stay alone and make him help me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. because he had already got a mind that can control the world. Not his orders now. No sir, but the mind of God. Any successful marriage is guided and led by the mind of Christ. When the mind of a man comes, that marriage begins to stagger. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is the spiritual mind that worked in Christ giving him humility. Let this mind be you which was also in Christ Jesus. Then this mind drives the thinking of a true husband to guide his family back. Amen. And when we say that the family has the same mind we are saying they think through the same filter of the word. Their judgment about the dressing God is the same. Not because the father push it on them, but because that's what the world say. They are connected to the headship. They connected and they got a thinking man's field. So to put the edge together, the messenger carries the mind of God and gives it to the edge. And then in the age, the local ministry had to build from the mind of the messenger to feed the local church. not to feed it with my mind, but to feed it with the mind of Christ as revealed by the message of the end. [Applause] And if we were doing that, we would not have battles in churches because we are led by the same man. Amen. We will not have battles in our families. We are led by the same man. We are subject to the same intelligence Christ. Don't feel sorry for me. You may be you may be so sympathetic to me and even fail to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Paul was the first message. This you know is very important for you. It may sound like ministerial but you see if you understand how the ministry works then you cannot be taken by a contrary ministry. You see what I mean? You are equipped. Amen. To stand in the time when a spirit tries to tear the border apart. Amen. Okay. Chapter 20 of the book of Acts. Paul is the first message. Now time comes that his ministry is done. I want to tell you friends, it doesn't matter how good a minister is. Time comes when his time is over and the time of Paul was over. But because he was concerned about what he had done, he had to prepare the people for a handover. It doesn't matter how good Moses was. Time came and his time was over. It doesn't matter how good Joshua was. to come to a time because his time was over. And Paul here, his time is over. And he went and stationed in letters and he sent to Ephesus and called all the elders of the church. What is he trying to do from God to the messenger? Now to the elders. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the book of Acts chapter 20 &gt;&gt; and verse 27. &gt;&gt; For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the God. is telling these elders, I didn't hold back anything that was necessary for you. So he's now telling them, "Take what I have given you and take heed therefore unto yourselves and all the flock over them which the Holy Ghost has made you overseer and feed the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood." Paul was concerned that the church must remain as a body. That's the desire of our local church and it's the desire of the smaller units of our church which are called families. Amen to have the same filter. So the elder who feeds the church to keep it in one mind is the pastor. Nobody's going to come from outside and do the work of our person. It's given to him of the Holy Ghost. If another man comes, he comes to support not to tear the body. &gt;&gt; So brother Brham said the elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the elder and the elder gives it to the people. Amen. Amen. So we ought to give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to use his pastor to get this whole entire church into one mind and that mind is the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that we may all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among us, but that we may be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. We are building one structure called the body of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'll try to tell you something here. &gt;&gt; Now this is Christ &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came down on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? He came down to pick the first church. And the first church was Ephesus. &gt;&gt; And now when Ephesus was mature, he pulled up a little bit. Amen. to lift the standard and the overcomers were magnet was were magnetized to the headship to take the second age. Then he pulled a little bit and again magnetized to come to the third age. Have you seen now the church has been growing been growing towards Christ towards the headship. This is the headship. This is the headstone. He came down to pick up the church. And whenever he saw that they are certain overcomers, he would give them another space so that they may come up in the higher growth of the church. That's the way God works. Amen. Even in our local church, he's not going to keep us on the same thing. He's going to keep lifting us, lifting us, lifting us, lifting us as he builds rapturing faith in you. Okay, I'll talk about the growth of the church here. Church of a perfect man. He says, you get it? The people who died in here are depending and waiting on us. &gt;&gt; They are waiting for you. It is scripture. The bride has made himself ready. Are you ready? You are granted the you are granted the wedding garment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know, let's let's just pick it up here. &gt;&gt; So, this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection. Who is holding back the rapture? &gt;&gt; You and me. And they are under s under the altar &gt;&gt; waiting for this church to come to his perfection. But when Christ come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority is a wall sharper. than that. Just like right that across there is come to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into place the same kind of a ministry that this left because this headstone comes back. It's got a little pocket like that where it's going to sit on the regular pil isn't a cup. It is not just a cup that sits across the top. is a little of lunch and it's got to sit there because it shades the water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The water comes from the talk washing the church. [Applause] What's the water? But the word, the washing waters of the word, they come from the headship speaking to the body. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You must be connected to the body. Don't allow you to be cut off. Even if you're a little finger. Amen. Amen. And when it comes this church has got to be honed. Amen. There are certain things that must be cut off. And in the cutting sometimes there is some emotion [Music] but you have to go through it. a little pain to cut off some of our good fashions. I would have liked to show but you know that is cut off. Certain things are horn that you may fit to the nature and character of the headstone. Amen. So all these rest the stones in the pyramid align so perfect till you can't run a razor blade between them because this stone sits on this stone but it is so tight that you cannot even pass a blood that type of oneness that no spirit can be able to cut you off from God. Amen. Yeah. You've got such a harmony. You become one that when the people begin to see where do they join the you cannot see one with one another. Amen. Praise the Lord. M &gt;&gt; and up here when the pyramid come does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed not only just some creed or doctrine or something other we can come through it will have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right together. Amen. Amen. So let us you know get so tight that we may keep away the human judgment from among ourselves. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We become so tired and we are such a unity in a diversity. &gt;&gt; But our unity is the mind of Christ. Amen. The hand will not start saying hey my fingers alone but you short like this it was necessary. Amen. Amen. For them to be that short otherwise you would not walk. And then says But the toe the thumb it is necessary to be in that nature in that form otherwise you would do not balance. Amen. I want you to stand up practical education. I want you to walk just around where you are. walk. Tell me it's your big toe which sends you in front. That's what it is. It's your big every member is important. If you don't have a toe, big toe, you you'll walk like a duck. You can be seated. Every member of the body is very important to learn to respect one another. [Applause] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I have this mouth here. It feeds but after it has eaten it closes. This mouth here should do not peek on the nose. Saying nose you mean you can't close all the time you are open every member of the body. is made the way it's made to benefit the body. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen here in the message total deliverance the prophecies. Now there is a group of offices of our church because now we are a body deacons, &gt;&gt; trustees, Sunday school, pastors and our church is set in order and youth people elected these officers and this pastor. I'm just general overseer. It's going on right and to give advice and so forth. You are the one who elects your pastor. You elect your trustees. You elect your deacons. You elect every office in the church. You are the people and it's your duty to stand by those men. Huh? Mhm. &gt;&gt; You are responsible for them. So stand by them for they will make mistake. They are mortals. They they are just men and they'll make mistakes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says if the president of the United States makes a mistake, &gt;&gt; do we throw him away, &gt;&gt; we forget about it and we move on? That's the way we want to do our church now. Preaching stability, a united body. Amen. Amen. He says, "I was listening to him pray a few minutes ago for those deacons. I hear back there testimony at the door from the trustees how that with one accord. You all are one. Now stay that way. You members stand by this trustees, deacons and pastors. Remember when you get this together, remember it's the devil's business to see that you are broken. The gospel doesn't preach division. The gospel preaches oneness. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only the devil's business to see that you are broken. It's always been always will be stand by your officers. Okay. So let us fight our battles from the top of the mountain. We fight them in prayer. If there is anything, let us pray for one another. Amen. Don't start to blame the nose or never closing. But when you pray, you realize the nose is responsible for the life of all the other members of it. Breathe in, brothers out. If you don't understand your brother, pray for one another. Encourage one another. You have to be assured. Amen. Upon which your brother can lean and cry when he's down. Amen. So when Israel went into battle with Amalecch, God took three great men to the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these men here were the engine of the battle. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They did not have a shield. They did not have a sword. But they were the engine of the battle. of men who were on the knees and their commission looked like it was very small. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God told them, "Come upon the mountain." And Moses, you are going to lift up your hands. Come on now. You are going to lift up your hand. And when your hands are up, Israel down will win the battle. when you put them down Israel down going to lose men and some of the people said Moses has been given and is a thing just lifting your hands like this. But when he went up there, one minute, two minutes, three minutes, four minutes, 1 minute, and the butter changed the course. And the people said it is. Let me tell you, every godgiven commission has its own triumph. Don't look at another man's part as the easy part. Pray for one another's position. Sisters, &gt;&gt; don't gossip about one another. Just pray for that sister's condition. Some of you the husbands are not believers. They cannot be word corrected. Pray for such sister. And Moses was constantly challenged by the nature of the human body. It gets weak. It gets fatigued. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then God told &gt;&gt; okay now and you okay one of you this way and one of you that way and giving us the help they also got you together with me. &gt;&gt; But God sometimes he knows what to do. He knows that even the ego loses his strength. Hallelujah. Praise God. So he tells a tells you go and get a stone here. Put the hands of Moses on them. Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows how we shall make it as a body. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't start saying ah beating us Moses failing us in the next church. Even in the next church you have trouble. You must be a united body. He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might. He increase the strength and the strength of Moses was the man that were holding his hallelujah. I want some people that will say I'm going to be the horn. In this church, the hiding of power, hold the hands of the minister that the body may be blessed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you are the strength of the ministry. You must always hold up your pastor's heart. Amen. Praise God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see how we pick up from here. &gt;&gt; Do you love him, friends? &gt;&gt; I love him. There are certain things that we have to fight and be able to overcome. Now, &gt;&gt; the body of the church is just defined like this body. Just like this body, this body gets sick. &gt;&gt; Even if you're saved in the soul, your natural body can still get sick. Even if we are a church body baptized by the Holy Ghost, we shall always have things which challenge the church. Especially if we don't observe. Amen. The way God set up local churches, there will always be problems. Amen. Amen. Because God gave the local church sovereignity to stand by itself. Amen. But you'll find out that there will be men that come to fight for that church. That is ours. That is ours. I will not go into that. But let us look at the sickness of the body. The prophet in the message here him says the greatest need of healing tonight. And the sickest body that I know of in all the world is the body of the Lord Jesus. The church, &gt;&gt; he says it's the sickest body is horribly sick. It's broken up and scattered. It needs a healing. May God send the Holy Spirit in such a power. The war body of Christ will be brought together. born with love and unity. [Applause] The sickest body is not your body. It's the body of the church. And I'll take time today and speak about two diseases that affect the body of the church. Amen. Amen. just by taking a relationship with the natural body. I'll talk first about cancer. Amen. Cancer is a bruised cell. Amen. Amen. It's a bruised cell. Sometimes you knock yourself. Sometimes all those kind of but bruised cell. Amen. And then that cell begins to grow uncontrollably. Amen. And that's why you hear as distributed in the body together with so the bruised cell fails to get what I mean blood supply in that area and the reason why it grows uncontrollably is because it's trying to reach out where it can get black. But wherever it touches, it affects that cell is the spread of a cancer. Okay. So, brother Brandham calls this cell a backsliding cell. Amen. And now we are all different cells of the body of Christ. And if one cell, one member of the church comes to a spot, but he does not have a blood supply anymore. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That man there cannot get his correction, cannot get instruction, cannot in any case. Amen. So whether he gets connected with he infects him with his unbelief cancerous cell. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it becomes a cancerous cell. And now because the only way we can get the blood is by getting the word because the word and the blood became the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is no fountain of blood on Mount Calvary where we can go and scoop and wash you. But when we preach the word and you believe the word that becomes the blood. So if you have a man in church who does not have a blood supply, he does not accept the teaching of God. He's in the church. But contrary to the voice of the spirit, he's a backsliden cell and that's a cancerous cell. It will kill another cell body. is the body of the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; In Christ, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says here, "Love one another." &gt;&gt; Will you love me? [Music] &gt;&gt; Even after this service. Amen. Love one another above everything. Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say. Now you are all one big great sweet group. But remember my warning. Satan won't let that stay that way. No sir. He will shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in. to make his target. Amen. He bring some critic or an unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness of you. And then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it. Amen. Don't you take sides with it. Don't you have nothing to do with anything else? You stay loving and sweet and kind to one another. Pray for that man that you'll be saved also for that woman. Whoever it is, just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor. The shepherd and he'll give give him respect. He'll lead you through because he's ordained of God. It doesn't have a blood washing anymore. But yet he wants relate with the people and still poison them. Have you believed what he preached? I don't believe. I don't believe a cancerous cell. So, &gt;&gt; let's hit the top of it. Preaching stability, &gt;&gt; autoimmunity. You see autoimmunity is the infighting of body cells. You are given an immune system but it is so zealous that after it has fought the disease it even forgets and it starts eating other parts of the cell. That's the worst thing. I have medical people here. Autoimmunity. So the autoimmunity is where the the immune system becomes crazy and it begins to eat its own cells. Amen. For cancer, the body experiences a bruise. But autoimmunity becomes his own enemy. And autoimmunity is a condition where that immune system lacks discernment. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It cannot discern the Lord's body anymore. and it begins to damage its own cell and it also destroys the organs of the body. Can you imagine the very guard you were given to guard you? Turns around and begins to shoot at you. Your children, your wife, autoimmunity. And he says it's the sickest body of all. to autoimmunity. These doctors here say there is no medication to it. You just deal with symptoms. That's what you find. Today you are given this. Tomorrow you are given that. Tomorrow you are given this. Tomorrow you are given that. You are in this and you are in that. autoimmunity. &gt;&gt; The immune system mistakenly begins to attack the cells is supposed to defend using the word of a bad after he has knocked off everything. Then the same act turns over to you. That's failure to recognize or to discern the Lord's body. That's why the scripture says that for that some are sick and even die. So in the natural this autoimmunity condition dismantles the functionary of the body by the same system. God assigned it to protect the body. Amen. We were given the word to protect the body. But sometimes you find people misuse the word body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It disrupts the hormone system and imbalances them. And hormones &gt;&gt; is the driving chemistry of the different things that helps the body to function. And when these hormones are disrupted, it affects the normal growth. of the body. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It cuts off sometimes the appetite &gt;&gt; and sometimes disrupts the mood of the person because there is an eternal battle. We need &gt;&gt; a very stable local church. &gt;&gt; We need a stable body of Christ. This autoimmune condition even disrupts the flow of insulin I mean from the pancreas &gt;&gt; until it causes the body to become diabetic. It disrupts the sinovia roots in this joint and it can cause even arthritis. The sickest body is the church. when they cannot be able to handle the you know defense system which is the word you know is an immune defense system becoming so overzealous and it begins to attack the very body cells that is supposed to defend. Amen. We are brethren. We cannot eat one another. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, that's the kind of preacher who is given the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. for the body as a defense. becomes very overzealous and throws force unrelated quotes, unrelated scripture because he's not trained in the handling of the word. And it causes a problem like it was in the in the other church. She let us &gt;&gt; they were handling the world in a different way and they preached that the resurrection was passed and the scripture says some even lost their faith. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are dealing with issues that stabilizes a church so that you can be in a church and be h about it. &gt;&gt; Is it on? Praise the Lord. Autoimmune condition is a very bad thing &gt;&gt; where Christ seeketh preeminence among the people. But then this other side John says your traers who seek God's preeminence among you he blocks us from coming to autoimmune condition. But today we are not coming to a natural doctor but we are coming to God who has got the ability &gt;&gt; to recreate. Are you together with me today? If your spiritual immune system has gone crazy, we have got a God. who cannot deal with the symptoms. But he wants to recreate the immune system that we can be able to discern the Lord's body. There must come a healing upon the way we use the word. We need not go but quote the word. Amen. Brother said that the enemy instead of quoting he did God say he begins to court. God have mercy. So the ministry needs to handle the word which we have been given in such a way that it built. So that you may be built and that even when you pick the word and you study the word, you will see the element of building you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And be able to take the word of it in structure. Amen. This truth must be preached but in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you remove divine love from the message the quotes become stones. You are not helping. You are trying to hit on the head. We are here to heal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every minister is here &gt;&gt; to heal. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must preach, we must preach the truth in love, knowing that it's God and God alone who holds the lamb's book of life. Are you together with me? There are find some people they take this book and the best they can do is remove you from the book. They put you in the book. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this afternoon? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My name is not put in the book in time. It was put in the book before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; To such a way that no man can remove it from the world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want tell you that the blood is available for every condition you go through. The blood is here to heal. Not like somebody's the only one who has got a cup to give you a little gift. We thank God &gt;&gt; for the way the word is handled here [Applause] and just hold it that which you have hold and let it become healer. It was given to us. for fortification and not for a hammer to bring cancer bruises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something. Look at Timothy. The five-fold ministry is ordained of God. But &gt;&gt; these gifts &gt;&gt; grow I mean grow &gt;&gt; they are given of God &gt;&gt; but they grow most of the problems we have is the people who have been given gifts but they don't wait for the growth and they go ahead. When Moses was given a gift, it devolved for 40 years before Moses went to the field. When Elisha followed Elijah for eight solid years, it took him another 10 years to fit in the mount of Elijah. [Music] But before that, he was performing signs and wonder. But at that time, he couldn't even control his temper. And he caused the foxes fields and I mean killed I mean ate these young kids. Elisha had hard to grow feet in the rope. Brother Brham says today we are trying to cut the rope cut it. They don't have the patience to wait and grow into the size of the mountain. The spirit of Elijah was upon him and in a double portion but he needed to grow in that anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at first Timothy chapter 4. Do you love him French? Do you love Bible teaching? is a little more apostolic here to build, you know, but you need it. 1 Timothy chapter 4. Look at Timothy here. pauses till I come give a tendency to reading to exaltation to doctrine. He's telling a man who had a gift and he was a minister. But he says give attest to reading to exaltation to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that's in thee which was given thee by prophecy. [Applause] with the laying on of the hands of the priest betrayed. The gift was in there. Timothy don't neglect that gift. Amen. Feed it with the word. Amen. and verse 15. Meditate upon this thing. We give thyself holy to them &gt;&gt; that thy propheting may appear to all. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are given a gift. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are blessed. But then feed it by study. Meditate on doctrine that your prostit may appear to all [Applause] that when you stand you can be able to bless the church so that you cannot again take the fortification. fortification to destroy the people. This is supposed to be their immune system. The why so use it very well that your ministry will not become an autoimmune condition. Take heed unto thyself, unto the doctrine, continuing them. For in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself and those that hear you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You saved yourself and those who hear you. [Applause] Meaning that a ministry much as is given of God if it's not natural to stabilize and grow. It can destroy you and destroy those. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Most of the ministers are victims of the immune condition. condition. Those are men sometimes who don't link to God to hear from God, &gt;&gt; but they are transmitters. They get from here, put here, here, put here. But Paul says, "Study and meditate on these things. begin to go through them and see that you get profitable conclusion that will benefit the church. A God called man must have the ability to use the sword with his own arm of faith. Let's go. Second Corinthians. I'm finishing soon. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The advice &gt;&gt; to the ministers. He says, &gt;&gt; "For we in 2 Corinthians 10:12, &gt;&gt; for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves. &gt;&gt; For they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise. the spirit of competition. I'm better than that one. I'm better than that one. I'm better than the other one. Christ is our standard. He says when they come to comparing among themselves, he says they are not wise. &gt;&gt; Verse 13, &gt;&gt; but we will not boast of things without our measure. Brother Wilson, we cannot boast of things without our measure. But according to the measure of the rule which God has disputed to us a measure to reach even unto you. Praise the Lord. What is Paul saying here? God distributes a measure. Amen. to the minister and that measure is supposed to be given to him to suffice the people speaking among [Applause] not just go and scoop it and then you begin to throw to the people scoop it to the people the minister has got to hear from [Applause] And he has such a level that can bless the people. Amen. Paul says that no minister should burst on stolen waters. Amen. The book of proverbs says stolen waters are sweet. is what God has directly given you which turns into blessing for your audience. Verse 14. Amen. &gt;&gt; For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure. We don't lift ourselves up. to go beyond what God has given us. We walk in that measure and we begin to bless you in that measure and also begin to grow in that measure. What you take doesn't harm you, but what you take, it grooms you and enables you &gt;&gt; to understand what you are in the body of Christ. Amen. Amen. [Music] Verse 14. as though we reach out unto you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Paul says that I don't try to draw things from far away so that I bring to you that like as if what I have is not enough for you. He gives us what he gives us and we give it to you and you take them and they become life to you. In that way we will not kill other cells. We don't just go but you keep your measure. And even when God places you in the church, you be stable there. That's where the measure that God has for you is. That's where the measure that will groom you is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your lane. Verse 15. Not boasting of things without our measure. that is other men's labors. But having hope when your faith is increased that you shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly. Hallelujah. Amen. He says that we cannot boast in other man's labors. God gives us what you need measure. As you take it and feed on it, we are going to grow by it and together we are going to rejoice in the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So don't become another man's message. So let me finish on this note. Amen. Amen. Praise God. I love the Lord this afternoon. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. &gt;&gt; And I'm just preaching stability autoimmunity. Amen. So occupied the office of the king but without a divine. He was a people's choice of a king but not God's choice. He failed because that was not his call. He went into battle with David and as a king. He did not understand what submission in his office was. He was given commission on battlefields. He would do different things. God threw him out. And the worst of it is that he did not merit as a king. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was he did not merit because as the king of Israel as king of Israel he was supposed to be a judge and the defense of the people. [Applause] But Saul when the time came proof that he was the defense of the people he panicked and then David came forth and he said who is this uncircumcised little who is making the Lord's people to panic be distracted. &gt;&gt; He was a balanced immune defense system for the people. [Applause] He knew what to do. He was able to understand who the enemy was. And when David stepped forward, he brought down Goras. &gt;&gt; But then Saul, &gt;&gt; he was an otter. He started hunting for devil. And we see a lot of that people out there in the field, they are just autoimmune situations, they are hunters over their own brothers. And finally, Saul because he did not understand how to handle the world, he fell. on his own sword and it killed him. &gt;&gt; This world &gt;&gt; is a giver &gt;&gt; of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But it must be handled &gt;&gt; by a man &gt;&gt; who has been trained &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has life. &gt;&gt; There was no need &gt;&gt; for Saul to fall on his own sword. Not that he was not God's child. He was because even after he died, he was a pioner. Amen. Amen. He went home. There are so many people that are falling on their own. Tell your brother this word here is the gift of life. Study it. So Paul finally gives Timothy and he gives him the advice in 2 Timothy 2:15 day. Show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. You split the middle that you don't let the word kill the people. &gt;&gt; The word gives life. The word is our defense and must be used to give the body life. When you get into this world, be sure that you are under that mind. You are under that intelligence. God will use this word to establish you, to bless you, to prosper you, to heal you, to keep yourself the center of the glory and presence of God. God bless you. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? Do you love him? &gt;&gt; We thank God for our past. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let us keep this word &gt;&gt; and bond us with one another under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. I think pastor, you can come. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. God bless you. So before the pastor takes over, let's stand up and have a word of prayer. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for your grace over and over. You've been speaking to us about stability. We thank you for this other one, Lord. which you have brought to us, encouraging us to be one in Christ and bonded by the word. I pray heavenly father that you may bless your children that have heard the word. Bless their souls, Lord. as they begin to relate to the word. I pray father that as they study the word the word may constantly release life at them because the word in itself is life. I commit them to you Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. [Applause] God bless you. [Music] Do you appreciate our pastor? Amen. Amen. I believe that I sing that song. I've decided as each of us goes to pray, the Holy Spirit has spoken to you. Praise the name of our Lord. You know how we can see that we avoid cancers in ourselves, how we can avoid autoimmune in ourselves and all things that can put us away from the body of Christ. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. [Applause] No turning by. No turning by. I have decided to follow Jesus. I decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Now the cross before me. Thou cross before me. Now behind me. Thou before me. Beind me. cross before me thy [Applause] No heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh no, your turning will be me. I will follow where he meat. [Music] We all can hear my savior now. Heat. Heat. Heat.
