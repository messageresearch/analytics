[17:13] Father. And we thank you, Lord, because
[17:15] your showers of blessings are always

[17:20] for this day. And Father, we come
[17:24] praising and glorifying your holy name
[17:26] of the things you've done even as we
[17:29] sing showers of blessing because we are
[17:31] expecting more from you. Father, I want
[17:34] to bring the offeratories and the test
[17:36] that has been brought into your house.
[17:38] Father, we pray that you'll accept and
[17:41] Lord bless your children even as you
[17:44] said in your word that Lord, let us test
[17:47] you with this and see if you'll not open
[17:50] up the heavens. If you'll not pour down
[17:53] that we'll not even have enough space to
[17:56] contain it. Lord, we believe that those
[17:58] words are true and they are sincere. And
[18:01] Father, we have brought that wish you've
[18:03] given unto us. For we have nothing but
[18:06] what we received from you. And Father,
[18:09] on your own things we have brought back
[18:11] into your house. We pray that you bless
[18:13] us, Lord. I pray that you bless your
[18:16] children in their point of need. Some of
[18:19] them are sick. Some of them are looking
[18:21] for jobs. Some of them need more
[18:23] revelation from you. Some of them have
[18:25] questions, Lord. Some of them are
[18:27] desperate. Lord, I pray that you reach
[18:30] out at their point of need and be an
[18:32] answer. Heavenly Father, we also commit
[18:35] the rest of the service, the preaching
[18:36] of the word and the hearing of it that
[18:38] Lord you blessed in special way that
[18:40] Lord you will speak to us that we will
[18:42] walk out of this place and have a
[18:45] testimony that we have been with
[18:47] Jesus. We thank you heavenly father and
[18:50] we appreciate we commit all things into
[18:52] your hands believing and trusting in the
[18:55] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[30:43] Jesus
[30:45] Christ. It was such a very happy day.
[30:49] when you washed away all our
[30:51] sins. Oh, we are grateful heavenly
[30:54] father that we can come into your
[30:57] presence. You said where two or three
[30:59] are
[31:00] gathered. You'll be there in their
[31:03] midst. We believe you in our midst
[31:06] tonight. So we call upon your
[31:08] name. You come and speak to us heavenly

[31:49] ministering that your purpose and will
[31:51] be
[31:52] done we thank you Lord in the name of
[31:56] the Lord Jesus
[31:57] Christ. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[32:03] I greet you in the name of our Lord
[32:04] Jesus
[32:06] Christ. My voice is not the
[32:09] best. Since Tuesday, I've been fighting
[32:11] this cold and
[32:13] [Music]
[32:16] flu, but I thank God that we are here
[32:20] today. And then we want to appreciate
[32:22] those who came for the overnight on
[32:26] Friday. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[32:29] just want to encourage everyone of us
[32:32] Whenever the church is
[32:34] opened, see that you are part of the
[32:37] services. Praise the name of our Lord.
[32:40] Because that could be your day of full
[32:44] victory or that could be your day that
[32:47] the Lord says, "Let me release what
[32:49] you've been asking for all this
[32:52] time in the name of our
[32:55] Lord." I want to recognize Mama Rich, if
[32:58] you can stand up.
[33:02] with your daughters. You're
[33:08] welcome. She's a businesswoman in town,
[33:10] you may sit
[33:13] down. And I also pray next time you come
[33:15] with Mr. David, your
[33:19] husband. You come part of
[33:22] us. Praise the name of our Lord. even
[33:25] other visitors if you're here and you
[33:26] can just raise up your
[33:30] hand. You're welcome
[33:34] brother. Amen. Amen. So there is an
[33:37] appreciation here from
[33:42] brother. God bless you
[33:44] saints and dear
[33:47] pastor. I humbly thank you for standing
[33:49] with
[33:51] me in the trying moment when I lost my
[33:54] beloved
[33:57] auntie. I really appreciate your
[33:59] attendance at the barrier
[34:02] ceremony and thank you for the effort
[34:05] spiritually, financially and
[34:06] emotionally.
[34:13] I don't have enough words to express my
[34:17] appreciation, but may the good Lord
[34:20] reward you
[34:23] abundantly. Remember my mother in
[34:26] prayers. This is from our brother
[34:30] Ben. We appreciate those able to go for
[34:32] the bar on
[34:35] Thursday. Personally, I was not able
[34:40] We always reserve outreach services on
[34:42] Thursday I was in for
[34:47] services to go praise the name of our
[34:51] Lord. You know the Bible tells
[34:53] us we should mourn with those who are
[34:57] mourning. We should rejoice with those
[34:59] who are
[35:01] rejoicing. Praise the name of that one
[35:04] should continue doing it.
[35:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Then I also
[35:09] want to bring greetings from
[35:12] pastor and his
[35:14] wife. I talked to them last
[35:18] night. Praise the name of the Lord. On
[35:21] Friday he was preaching at brother
[35:24] Edis's church that is in
[35:30] Clodale. Of course, right now they have
[35:32] a new pastor called Tom Ray.
[35:36] And
[35:37] yesterday I took time to listen the
[35:40] whole
[35:42] service and it was a very good
[35:45] service and I wanted to share
[35:48] it but it is hard to share it unless you
[35:51] download the
[35:55] sermon. Maybe we may download the sermon
[35:58] and share with
[36:01] you. But I would encourage you to
[36:05] listen. Praise the name of Lord. Was
[36:08] preaching on if no if you know the gift
[36:11] of
[36:15] God. Amen. And it was such a great
[36:18] blessing. Just one and a half hours
[36:21] service and it was very good. Just keep
[36:24] him in your
[36:26] prayers day up to the middle of the
[36:30] month up to around 15th of
[36:33] May. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[36:36] remember that on 18th
[36:40] May it will be a
[36:42] Sunday. We shall have a handover service
[36:45] here and then outside we shall have the
[36:48] function.
[36:52] So let us be in preparations for
[36:55] that. So today after the
[36:58] service we shall have the first
[37:00] preparatory meeting
[37:04] outside how we can go about
[37:06] it. We want to appreciate all those who
[37:08] have contributed so
[37:12] far those who have
[37:14] pledged and even those who are yet to
[37:17] make
[37:19] decisions. Let us just stand
[37:21] together. Praise the name of our Lord.
[37:24] Sometimes the strations can be
[37:27] hard. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[37:30] sometimes that's when you call support
[37:31] for
[37:34] others. That's when you need
[37:36] support. Praise the name of Lord. Today
[37:39] we have only one
[37:41] service but after the service we shall
[37:43] have a meeting outside
[37:45] for
[37:48] preparation and then today brother
[37:50] Wilson started started the Sunday school
[37:54] services Sunday
[37:56] school normally we are meant to have
[37:59] Sunday school from
[38:03] 10:00 Sunday school for us
[38:06] here up to 10:30
[38:10] 30. So let us be mindful to really come
[38:13] in
[38:15] time. Praise the name of our Lord.
[38:18] Brother Wilson has gone to preach at
[38:19] brother Jerema's church
[38:25] in kept him in prayers. Even brother
[38:28] Jeremiah went
[38:30] to preach at brother Martin's
[38:33] church. Even brother Moses
[38:36] today is also helping in the song
[38:39] service
[38:41] at praise the name of I think you can
[38:44] see the gaps are
[38:46] many praise the name of but we want to
[38:50] appreciate
[38:53] [Applause]
[38:59] brotherh I'm trying I'm
[39:02] praying to identify more
[39:07] Praise the name of we thank God how we
[39:11] identified
[39:13] brother was able to fit in the gap when
[39:16] Jeremiah
[39:18] left the name of so I'm praying God to
[39:21] guide me to get identify other
[39:26] people who can help in the services of
[39:28] the
[39:30] lord praise the name of our lord so next
[39:34] Sunday, we shall also have only one
[39:37] service. We are meant to have the Lord's
[39:39] supper every first Sunday of the
[39:45] month. But we are finding there is a big
[39:49] gap among the youth who are coming
[39:53] up. Praise the name of our Lord. The
[39:56] pressures of the day are so
[39:59] much. So what we want to
[40:02] do because most of the youth have come
[40:06] back, let me ask them to stand up. Those
[40:08] who have just come back from school,
[40:15] few are
[40:17] here. Even behind there there are a
[40:19] number of them. Let us clap for
[40:24] them. So you may sit down. So during
[40:28] this
[40:28] holiday with effect from next
[40:31] Sunday we want to have afternoon
[40:34] services for the
[40:37] youth. Praise the name of the whole up
[40:41] to such that we can have more
[40:43] interaction with
[40:45] them and be able to help them in the
[40:48] spiritual
[40:49] growth. Praise the name of So we shall

[50:04] Amen. Let us clap for them.
[50:08] Amen. To be like Jesus.
[50:11] Praise the name of our Lord.
[50:14] So today asking for the grace of
[50:18] God. We just want to start on church
[50:23] order. Praise the name of our Lord.
[50:26] Those days we used to have it so much in
[50:28] our Sunday
[50:32] schools. But our Sunday school services
[50:34] have not been always consistent.
[50:39] So it is necessary that we start
[50:42] it to remind
[50:45] ourselves praise the name of our lord.
[50:48] You know, I was
[50:51] reading during the dedication of the bra
[50:54] tabernacle in March
[51:00] 1963. And then brother Brham was
[51:02] preaching on the sermon God hiding
[51:05] himself in
[51:09] simplicity. He took time on church
[51:14] order. Praise the name of the Lord. Now
[51:17] in December of that same
[51:21] year the he was receiving
[51:25] questions from the
[51:27] deacons and one of the complaint
[51:31] was the parents and the children they
[51:36] don't want to hear the instructions of
[51:37] the deacons concerning the church order
[51:39] which was done in March.
[51:52] He talks about the order in March of
[51:59] 1963 and then now in
[52:02] December they are
[52:04] complaints that people don't want to
[52:06] hear these
[52:07] things and even some people had left
[52:10] church because they don't want to keep
[52:12] the church order.
[52:15] Now you can imagine hardly six hardly n
[52:21] months people had not following what was
[52:24] told to them in
[52:27] March and then here we've taken a bit of
[52:31] time without talking about church
[52:35] order. So it is very
[52:37] important that we take some bit of
[52:40] time to talk about church
[52:43] order. So today by the grace of God I
[52:47] want to talk about our conduct in
[52:51] church. Then next Sunday God
[52:55] willing I want to talk more on maybe
[52:57] another
[53:00] aspect still on church
[53:02] order maybe another service and so on
[53:05] like that.
[53:07] God will guide us. So let us stand up
[53:10] and have a word of prayer
[53:14] again. Father, in the name of our Lord
[53:17] Jesus
[53:18] Christ, we thank you again this
[53:21] morning, the grace that you've given
[53:23] unto us that we can come into your
[53:27] presence. You told us, heavenly
[53:30] father, that judgment starts from the
[53:32] house of God.
[53:35] Here is where we are
[53:37] corrected. Here is where we are guided
[53:40] how to conduct
[53:43] ourselves. We pray that the Holy
[53:46] Spirit will come and speak to us.
[53:49] Father, lead us and to guide
[53:51] us, how we can best relate with you when
[53:54] we come into your
[53:57] presence. Bless us, Father. Respect us,
[54:00] Lord. Deliver us, heavenly father, from
[54:03] all our
[54:05] weaknesses, from all our
[54:07] failures. Help us to be obedient to
[54:10] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:14] Christ. Amen. Amen. While we are still
[54:17] standing, let us go to first Timothy
[54:24] 3 and then verse 15.
[54:31] 1 Timothy 3:15,
[54:37] he says, "But if I turn along, that thou
[54:42] mayest know how thou owest to behave
[54:45] thyself in the house of God, which is
[54:48] the church of the living God, the pillar
[54:52] and ground of the truth.
[55:08] May God bless of his
[55:09] word. You may be
[55:12] seated. So I want to take time and talk
[55:14] about our conduct in
[55:18] church. So he says that we need to
[55:23] know how we behave
[55:27] ourselves in the house of God. Like here
[55:31] this place has been
[55:34] dedicated for the services of the
[55:37] Lord. Here is where we can come and
[55:40] worship
[55:41] more. Here is where we can come and
[55:44] praise
[55:45] God. Here is where we can
[55:48] come and pour all our hearts to the
[55:51] Lord and tell Lord this is
[55:54] this is my need. Lord this is my
[55:58] desire. And now each and every one of
[56:01] us we come with different
[56:05] issues. We come with different
[56:07] needs. We come with different
[56:10] challenges. And so it is always very
[56:14] important that as each and every one of
[56:17] us will leave our
[56:20] homes, how we are coming
[56:22] here, let us be
[56:25] concerned about others
[56:27] also who are coming into the presence
[56:30] of praise the name of our Lord. You know
[56:33] that your
[56:36] action can affect the deliverance of
[56:39] another person.
[56:43] The way you conduct
[56:45] yourself in the presence of God, you can
[56:48] grieve the Holy
[56:50] Spirit and then the Holy Ghost doesn't
[56:53] have liberty to
[56:56] operate. Praise the name of Lord. So we
[56:59] need to say that when we come in the
[57:00] presence of
[57:02] God, let us create an
[57:06] atmosphere whereby the Holy Spirit
[57:10] has the
[57:12] liberty to minister to us. Praise the
[57:15] name of Lord. Let us create an
[57:18] atmosphere and an atmosphere that is
[57:20] accepted before
[57:22] God is that when he has spoken of his
[57:27] word. Praise the name of God. We can now
[57:30] give an
[57:32] example in Mark chapter
[57:37] 11. And then in verse 15,
[57:42] the Bible says,
[57:44] Mark
[57:47] 11:15, and they came to Jerusalem, and
[57:51] Jesus went into the temple, and began to
[57:54] cast out them that sold and bought in
[57:58] the temple. and overthrew the tables of
[58:01] money changers, and the seats of them
[58:03] that sold doves, and would not suffer
[58:07] that any man should carry any vessel
[58:10] through the temple. And he taught,
[58:12] saying unto them, It is not, is it not
[58:14] written, my house shall be called of all
[58:18] nations, the house of prayer, but you
[58:20] have made it a den of thieves.
[58:36] Isaiah
[59:08] Praise the name of the Lord. He goes
[59:10] into the
[59:11] temple and these people had made the
[59:13] temple
[59:16] atmosphere to be a business
[59:20] place. You know when you go to the
[59:23] market there is no agenda
[59:29] there. You find this one is crossing
[59:31] there is crossing there is standing
[59:36] in you know everybody is doing their own
[59:39] things. This one is going the other side
[59:43] is going the other side. This one is
[59:44] doing whatever. The other one is
[59:46] shouting. One is singing. I put
[59:49] on the
[59:52] other one I put on the other
[59:54] radio
[59:55] on the other one is doing
[59:58] this free
[1:00:01] place. And so that's what they were
[1:00:03] doing in the temple
[1:00:05] of said this is not what the purpose of
[1:00:08] this place is.
[1:00:12] And you know like when you go to a
[1:00:15] funeral, people of business will always
[1:00:17] be there along the road to the
[1:00:21] funeral. Different things, different
[1:00:23] things, different
[1:00:25] things. There's a funeral went for in
[1:00:28] some time
[1:00:30] ago and people are selling their
[1:00:35] pork ready to eat different chopsticks
[1:00:38] around.
[1:00:41] And the the ones of beer are also there
[1:00:43] along the
[1:00:45] road. Everything like that. But you see
[1:00:48] when we come to the house of
[1:00:51] God, we need to come with
[1:00:55] respect. We need to come with the
[1:00:59] honor deserves in the place of
[1:01:03] God. How I'm coming to the place of
[1:01:06] God. Praise the name of God. How am I
[1:01:09] dressing when I come into the
[1:01:13] house? How am I conduct myself when I
[1:01:16] come into the presence of
[1:01:18] God? What am I meant to do in the
[1:01:21] presence of
[1:01:23] God? I think it was last
[1:01:26] year. And then there were parents in I
[1:01:31] believe they went to a certain
[1:01:34] church and then they put this kid. I
[1:01:37] think either it was some of these cars
[1:01:39] or what I don't remember
[1:01:42] exactly. Either it was these small cars,
[1:01:45] you know, these
[1:01:48] toys and then they put the church like
[1:01:50] that
[1:01:52] coming out to the family. It was
[1:01:57] great. But how about the environment
[1:02:00] you're creating in
[1:02:02] that until the leadership of the
[1:02:06] church such a kind of
[1:02:09] thing? There are things people can
[1:02:11] freely do at
[1:02:14] home. They can do them at home because
[1:02:17] they have the liberty to do such things
[1:02:19] at
[1:02:21] home into the presence of God. When you
[1:02:24] come into the church, there is a certain
[1:02:28] way you come with
[1:02:31] respect. The Bible is telling us how we
[1:02:34] ought to
[1:02:36] behave when we're in the presence of
[1:02:39] God. Praise the name of God. You know,
[1:02:41] you can't go to a meeting of a
[1:02:45] president and you are all the time in
[1:02:47] and
[1:02:49] out, in and out, in and
[1:02:52] out. Security men will ask you what's
[1:02:54] wrong with
[1:02:56] you? What is it? Why you
[1:03:00] disrupting? How about in the presence of
[1:03:03] God? And then here we look at our
[1:03:07] church. The doors are
[1:03:11] through. So somebody can say, I want to
[1:03:13] go this
[1:03:19] side. Oh, maybe I want to go here.
[1:03:23] So I walk from behind there, come in
[1:03:26] front and then go this side. Oh, I want
[1:03:29] to go the other side. So I come from
[1:03:31] here, just cross and then go. What
[1:03:35] environment are we then
[1:03:37] creating? How about the people who are
[1:03:41] seated paying
[1:03:43] attention trying to catch something from
[1:03:46] the
[1:03:47] Lord and then for me I'm just wishful
[1:03:50] walking.
[1:03:54] this place is shorter for
[1:03:56] me. And then in some places we even
[1:04:00] receive
[1:04:02] calls. Now you know I'm in
[1:04:06] church. How are we behaving in the
[1:04:09] presence of
[1:04:11] God? You imagine this kind of
[1:04:14] scenario. You've gone to somebody's
[1:04:18] office and you want that person to help
[1:04:20] you.
[1:04:22] The person is seated before you. He has
[1:04:25] given you a seat
[1:04:26] there and he's hearing you or is
[1:04:30] speaking to you and then you get a
[1:04:33] call. Say
[1:04:36] now you know I'm in the I'm in the
[1:04:39] chief's
[1:04:40] office. You'll call me later. Put
[1:04:43] yourself in the office. It being your
[1:04:46] own office.
[1:04:50] You are in your own office. Somebody
[1:04:52] wants you to help them. When they come
[1:04:55] in your office, they are not paying
[1:04:57] attention
[1:04:59] to they cannot even just put that phone
[1:05:02] off or maybe keep it
[1:05:05] silent. If maybe somebody is calling,
[1:05:08] I'm sorry. You just kind of switch off
[1:05:11] that
[1:05:12] call. I'm sorry.
[1:05:16] There you are showing more respect to
[1:05:18] that
[1:05:19] person but now this person has to wait
[1:05:21] for you to receive
[1:05:24] the you have already cut off your
[1:05:27] conversation and so you find that you
[1:05:29] okay you have come to
[1:05:32] ask this person doesn't have any
[1:05:36] respect then how about when we come into
[1:05:38] the presence
[1:05:40] of the crate of the heavens and
[1:05:43] earth the place is dedicated for the
[1:05:48] services. If I want to do any
[1:05:51] conversation, why don't I go outside
[1:05:54] there? Thank God the whole environment
[1:05:56] here is
[1:05:59] made. Outside every place has been put
[1:06:03] conveniently. We have trees this side.
[1:06:06] We have trees the other side. Even along
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] ver and what is interesting
[1:06:14] the neighborhood
[1:06:16] here because our place is not
[1:06:19] gated. They come and sit there on the
[1:06:23] ver and some even just lie down
[1:06:26] there is made
[1:06:29] well. Then you get sometimes Buddha men
[1:06:32] sleeping there with their motorcycles
[1:06:33] under those
[1:06:35] streets when they get tired whatever
[1:06:38] they've done they come and sit there and
[1:06:41] then some come and have their meetings
[1:06:45] there but then for us we have no
[1:06:50] respect we would rather come and
[1:06:52] converse from
[1:06:54] here you know what
[1:06:56] happened you know this week this has
[1:06:59] this has been like this but there are
[1:07:01] many places outside you can do
[1:07:04] it but then you know we kind of like
[1:07:07] don't have you know that kind of
[1:07:12] respect and you see you find that we get
[1:07:15] ourselves caught up in that kind of
[1:07:19] situation you know but we need to see
[1:07:21] how we can behave
[1:07:24] ourselves whatever has been put here is
[1:07:27] to see how we can worship worship
[1:07:30] God. Praise the name of Lord. How do we
[1:07:33] conduct ourselves in the presence of
[1:07:36] God? And you know, God requires being
[1:07:42] honored. In his
[1:07:45] presence, praise the name of our Lord
[1:07:48] where he says, "Where is my
[1:07:52] respect?" That's what the Lord asks.
[1:07:56] Let us go to Malachi
[1:08:02] 1:6. Malachi 1 verse 6 to verse 8.
[1:08:10] The Bible says, "A son honors his father
[1:08:14] and a servant his master. If then I be a
[1:08:17] father, where is my honor? And if I be a
[1:08:20] master, where is my fear? Says the Lord
[1:08:23] of hosts." unto you all priests that
[1:08:26] despise my name. And you say, "Wherein
[1:08:29] have we despised thy name?
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] Then he says, "You offer the pluted
[1:09:00] bread upon mine altar, and you say,
[1:09:03] wherein have we polluted thee?" In that
[1:09:05] you say, "The table of the Lord is
[1:09:07] contemptable. And if you offer the blind
[1:09:10] for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if
[1:09:13] you offer the lame and sick, is it not
[1:09:15] evil? Offer it now unto thy governor,
[1:09:18] will he be pleased with thee or accept
[1:09:21] thy person, says the Lord of hosts?
[1:10:03] Praise the name of the Lord. So God was
[1:10:06] asking, if I'm your
[1:10:08] father, if I'm your lord, if I'm your
[1:10:11] creator,
[1:10:13] where is my
[1:10:15] honor? Praise the name of our Lord. Says
[1:10:18] give me
[1:10:20] respect, give me
[1:10:22] honor. Praise the name of says, if you
[1:10:25] can't do that to another
[1:10:27] person, why would you do it to the
[1:10:30] Lord? If you come in the presence of God
[1:10:34] and then you don't have
[1:10:36] respect. So then how how will it take
[1:10:40] you? Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:10:43] There's another scripture in 1 Samuel
[1:10:45] chapter 2.
[1:10:48] And
[1:10:55] then verse
[1:10:57] 30 says, "Why the Lord God of Israel
[1:11:01] says, I said indeed that thy house and
[1:11:04] the house of thy father should walk
[1:11:07] before me forever. But now the Lord
[1:11:09] says, "Be it far from me. For them that
[1:11:12] honor me, I will honor, and they that
[1:11:15] despise me shall lightly be esteemed.
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:57] carbon.
[1:11:58] Praise the name of the Lord says give me
[1:12:00] the
[1:12:01] honor if you despise me says I will take
[1:12:05] you
[1:12:07] lightly. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:12:09] we need to learn how to conduct
[1:12:11] ourselves in the presence of
[1:12:14] God. We need to come with
[1:12:17] honor. We need to come with
[1:12:21] respect when we are coming in the
[1:12:23] presence
[1:12:24] of praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:12:27] there are some
[1:12:29] scenarios there are some
[1:12:32] places praise the name of the other
[1:12:35] people when they are coming to
[1:12:37] church they come with
[1:12:45] slippers but they are
[1:12:47] working now when they are going to
[1:12:49] places of
[1:12:51] work they dress
[1:12:54] smartly. Now when they come to church
[1:12:58] they dress
[1:13:01] lousy and they think that's
[1:13:06] humility. No that's
[1:13:10] wrong. Praise the name of our Lord. They
[1:13:13] just come you know you know God bless
[1:13:17] you. at
[1:13:19] shabily but
[1:13:21] Monday when you meet them in their
[1:13:23] offices they're totally
[1:13:27] different we shouldn't do like that
[1:13:30] dress up
[1:13:33] decently you are coming to meet the king
[1:13:35] of
[1:13:36] kings are you coming to tell God lord I
[1:13:39] don't have clothes you taken long
[1:13:41] without buying for me
[1:13:46] clothes you know those days people were
[1:13:48] walking bare
[1:13:53] feet but nowadays people can afford to
[1:13:56] put on
[1:13:59] something come decent in the presence of
[1:14:03] God you know God told the children of
[1:14:07] Israel let us go to Exodus chapter 19
[1:14:09] verse
[1:14:15] 10 it says
[1:14:17] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go unto
[1:14:20] the people and sanctify them today and
[1:14:23] tomorrow, and let them wash their
[1:14:26] clothes.
[1:14:37] When you have dirty
[1:14:41] clothes, when you can
[1:14:45] wash, praise the name of
[1:14:49] Hey, even there is order he wants at
[1:14:51] home.
[1:14:55] But now for you either on on
[1:14:58] Sunday that's when you have to dress
[1:15:01] bad
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:03] dirty unless maybe when you something
[1:15:06] just happened there and
[1:15:09] then that you have to come to church
[1:15:12] maybe you
[1:15:13] drunkard maybe a certain
[1:15:16] situation that's different but then for
[1:15:19] you who knows that I'm meant to be on to
[1:15:21] church on
[1:15:23] Sunday. I'm going to be church on
[1:15:27] Wednesday and then you don't care how
[1:15:29] you
[1:15:31] dress or you don't
[1:15:34] bathe.
[1:15:36] Shabby and then you come to
[1:15:39] church. And you see
[1:15:41] nowadays shabiness is a
[1:15:47] fashion.
[1:15:49] Nowadays there is a singer
[1:15:53] He went to Tanzania
[1:15:56] and when he was in the Tanzania I think
[1:15:59] either he had drunk a lot of drugs.
[1:16:03] So he was thinking he was on a stage
[1:16:07] but he was passing through a
[1:16:09] window and he fell down and he got
[1:16:13] broken and then he was saying that man
[1:16:16] takes I don't know how long without
[1:16:18] bathing.
[1:16:23] But we shouldn't be like those
[1:16:26] people. These days you find people with
[1:16:29] hair which is not kept
[1:16:33] well
[1:16:36] shabby. You find men you find men their
[1:16:41] hair is just like potato
[1:16:45] hips just like this.
[1:16:50] We used to see mad men like
[1:16:52] that. But now madness is even on people
[1:16:54] who
[1:16:58] walk. Men making braided
[1:17:05] hair and it is so
[1:17:08] terrible. We are living in a terrible
[1:17:11] age.
[1:17:13] There is a profession here in
[1:17:18] Uganda and it's not only in Uganda but
[1:17:21] the whole
[1:17:23] world when you go to these
[1:17:25] people when you go to their schools in
[1:17:28] the
[1:17:30] universities they are the smartest
[1:17:32] students there at the
[1:17:40] university when you Those university
[1:17:43] schools, every university you get them,
[1:17:45] they are taught how to be
[1:17:49] decent because stand for
[1:17:52] people and they are told that is part of
[1:17:55] their
[1:17:57] culture. But let me tell
[1:18:00] you, praise the name of the Lord. What
[1:18:03] happened? They went and
[1:18:06] elected a person who is a
[1:18:09] raster with hair braided like that pe in
[1:18:12] the
[1:18:15] air thinks like that. So how is the
[1:18:19] world
[1:18:20] going? And then you now very smart
[1:18:25] person, very
[1:18:27] sharp. But see what happens
[1:18:31] outside. That's the trend of the world
[1:18:33] we having
[1:18:35] now is that the things which are
[1:18:38] wrong are highly exalted
[1:18:41] up. And you got some of these best
[1:18:44] universities in the world.
[1:18:47] You'll get such kind of
[1:18:51] people
[1:18:53] raers those international
[1:19:00] schools. That's why we need to take time
[1:19:03] with our young
[1:19:05] people because the influences are so
[1:19:09] terrible, terrible
[1:19:12] conditions. You know the world has
[1:19:14] turned upside down.
[1:19:17] And then we are living in a
[1:19:19] situation that parents cannot teach
[1:19:22] their children how to
[1:19:25] behave. They want to blame the school
[1:19:30] teachers. But the school teacher is a
[1:19:35] hiring is a hiring you
[1:19:39] own now for you. What have you done
[1:19:43] as praise the name of? So how do we
[1:19:46] dress when we are
[1:19:48] coming? We need to be
[1:19:50] decent with
[1:19:52] respect. Praise the name of like we've
[1:19:56] been trying to tell the people stand at
[1:19:57] the
[1:19:59] pal when you're coming here. Dress
[1:20:04] smartly. Put on a tie. I don't know what
[1:20:07] happened last Wednesday.
[1:20:12] Praise the name of Lord. I don't know
[1:20:14] either they forgot
[1:20:18] it or they just realized that even they
[1:20:21] going to come at the
[1:20:26] pulpit. I don't know but we keep on
[1:20:29] telling
[1:20:31] please have
[1:20:34] respect. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:20:36] You know you say this one two three
[1:20:41] times after some time
[1:20:44] there but there is a way we are expected
[1:20:47] to conduct
[1:20:50] our how about if maybe we I come with a
[1:20:55] t-shirt with
[1:21:00] sandals you'll ask is the So seek
[1:21:08] what? Praise the name of Yeah. There's a
[1:21:11] particular conduct we should
[1:21:14] have. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:21:17] there's a way God is expecting
[1:21:19] us to come before his
[1:21:22] presence in the Old Testament. There is
[1:21:26] the way the priesthood had to
[1:21:30] dress acceptable before
[1:21:33] God. Praise the devil. So we also have
[1:21:36] to have
[1:21:37] respect like now if I'm to be
[1:21:41] presentable before
[1:21:44] people you know somebody who is
[1:21:47] presentable or
[1:21:51] acceptable. There's an expectation of
[1:21:54] people that I expect him to dress like
[1:21:58] this to do like this and then I come in
[1:22:02] a different way.
[1:22:04] Somebody said maybe there was
[1:22:07] something maybe they just called him and
[1:22:09] take that service.
[1:22:12] But if you know that I'm going to
[1:22:13] conduct a
[1:22:16] service let me come prepared
[1:22:20] for praise the name of there's a conduct
[1:22:24] that is expected of
[1:22:26] us when we come before the presence of
[1:22:29] God.
[1:22:31] Praise the name of our Lord. Others
[1:22:33] you'll be like showing you have no
[1:22:36] respect. You have no
[1:22:39] honor. Praise the name of God. Now this
[1:22:43] does not mean at home we can do anything
[1:22:46] we
[1:22:48] want. It shouldn't be like that. Praise
[1:22:52] the name of our Lord. There is a home I
[1:22:56] visited. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:59] And I was shocked.
[1:23:02] But sometimes for the way they dress at
[1:23:05] home, they as if they're in their
[1:23:11] bedrooms. But we have also to have
[1:23:14] respect at
[1:23:15] home. Like if I'm at
[1:23:18] home, why should I come out with a
[1:23:23] towel and then appear
[1:23:27] naked? Why would I do that?
[1:23:31] Praise the name of the Lord. Why would I
[1:23:34] come, you know, at
[1:23:37] home? The way I sit.
[1:23:41] I don't
[1:23:42] care. I'm at home.
[1:23:46] But then you have opened other people to
[1:23:48] come where you are
[1:23:52] sitting. Like when you go to
[1:23:55] villages to the old
[1:23:57] mothers when it is
[1:24:00] hot, you know, they always put
[1:24:02] on. So when they sitting under the tree,
[1:24:06] the whole up is
[1:24:09] bare. Then you also want to do the same
[1:24:13] thing. We must also have
[1:24:16] respect how we conduct
[1:24:19] ourselves. Praise the name of
[1:24:21] God. Now let us just go and pick this
[1:24:25] scripture in Proverbs
[1:24:30] 7:10. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[1:24:33] says, "And behold, there met him a woman
[1:24:37] with the of aot and subtile of heart.
[1:25:01] Now he says there there is an
[1:25:07] attire there is a dressing of a
[1:25:09] prostitute.
[1:25:13] They are there is the way they
[1:25:15] dress and for them they dress to market
[1:25:20] what they
[1:25:24] have. Most of those places where people
[1:25:27] do so those kind of funny
[1:25:30] things. They are there to dress to
[1:25:32] seduce
[1:25:35] men. But now as children of
[1:25:38] God we shouldn't dress like that.
[1:25:42] Praise the name of you. You shouldn't
[1:25:43] dress like
[1:25:44] that. Why do you dress to seduce a
[1:25:48] person? And you know by the time you
[1:25:51] choose even what you're going to
[1:25:54] dress that means there is a spirit upon
[1:25:59] you which is causing you to do
[1:26:01] that. Praise the name of they dress to
[1:26:06] seduce
[1:26:13] And you know a spirit that makes you to
[1:26:16] seduce,
[1:26:19] it's a spirit of fornication or
[1:26:21] adultery.
[1:26:24] And then Jesus says, "Woever looks upon
[1:26:28] a
[1:26:30] woman and lust after
[1:26:33] her has committed adultery with
[1:26:38] her just only to
[1:26:41] look and then somebody lusts after
[1:26:47] you." Let us go to Matthew chapter 5.
[1:26:55] Matthew chapter
[1:26:57] 5 and then verse
[1:27:01] 28. But I say unto you, that looks on a
[1:27:06] woman to lust after
[1:27:10] her has committed adultery with her in
[1:27:14] his heart.
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:20] So on the door of
[1:27:22] judgment, what
[1:27:24] happens? A woman will
[1:27:27] stand with men
[1:27:30] behind. Who are these? You committed
[1:27:33] adultery with
[1:27:34] them. How? The way you
[1:27:38] dressed, seducing spirits.
[1:27:43] If you are born
[1:27:45] again, you will hate what is contrary to
[1:27:48] the word of
[1:27:51] God. Praise the name of Lord. If you
[1:27:54] know that you have things which are not
[1:27:57] right, you will throw them
[1:28:00] away. You'll not keep some in
[1:28:05] reserve. These ones are just for wearing
[1:28:08] at
[1:28:09] home. You know in church they want those
[1:28:12] long
[1:28:13] dresses. We don't just want but God
[1:28:16] wants
[1:28:18] that even at your
[1:28:20] home. Praise the name of why do you keep
[1:28:23] tight ones for
[1:28:26] home?
[1:28:28] Why throw them
[1:28:30] away. Praise the name
[1:28:33] of because they are evil spirits on
[1:28:36] those things.
[1:28:38] It's just like people were in
[1:28:41] witchcraft. They have their
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:47] charms. If maybe having a
[1:28:55] west if you accept the
[1:28:58] Lord, throw it away. Ban it.
[1:29:02] Praise the name of But now you say me,
[1:29:05] I'm going to keep this one here.
[1:29:09] So where is your heart
[1:29:11] now? You still have interest in that
[1:29:14] kind of
[1:29:16] thing. So even our
[1:29:19] dressing, praise the name of our Lord as
[1:29:22] children of
[1:29:23] God. You know there was a king in the
[1:29:27] Bible. The Bible says he did that which
[1:29:30] was right.
[1:29:33] In other words, when I come to
[1:29:35] church, I have to be like
[1:29:39] others. That's what they want us to do.
[1:29:41] But when they alone, they do what they
[1:29:44] want to do. It has a
[1:29:47] problem. The man was doing
[1:29:50] right before God, but the heart was not
[1:29:54] perfect before God. And that's the
[1:29:57] condition of a number of
[1:29:59] people. You find sisters on Sunday
[1:30:04] They are putting on and then some can
[1:30:07] ask you how far from the
[1:30:11] knees don't you see mine is a little
[1:30:14] bit how about when you
[1:30:19] sit and then when they are
[1:30:22] sitting they have to cross the
[1:30:25] leg because there's something they
[1:30:28] covering others put there the paper
[1:30:35] Why? Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:30:39] Why? And when they are sitting, they
[1:30:42] even change
[1:30:44] direction. Like for
[1:30:47] example, when they are sitting, sit like
[1:30:50] this because the thing is this
[1:30:54] way. They're not going to sit like this.
[1:30:57] They going to sit like this. They do
[1:30:58] like this. Put your paper
[1:31:02] Why aren't you
[1:31:04] free? Because you are
[1:31:06] bound. There's something
[1:31:09] wrong. Praise the name of our Lord. But
[1:31:12] if you're a child of
[1:31:13] God, release yourself from those
[1:31:16] things. If you dress
[1:31:19] right, praise the name of our Lord.
[1:31:22] But you see people when they at places
[1:31:24] of
[1:31:26] work
[1:31:29] tight when they come to church or maybe
[1:31:32] some move with other
[1:31:34] clothes when they are before they they
[1:31:37] come out for
[1:31:44] church the spirit is still
[1:31:46] wrong. Praise the name of when I'm at
[1:31:50] home. Let me dress
[1:31:53] right when I'm at place of work. Let me
[1:31:56] dress right when I come to church. Let
[1:31:59] me also dress
[1:32:01] right. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:32:04] That's what God expects us to
[1:32:06] do. What is our
[1:32:09] conduct? Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:32:12] God expects us to do these
[1:32:14] things. But you see the
[1:32:17] devil keeps on
[1:32:19] attacking,
[1:32:21] attacking, drawing
[1:32:24] you, drawing you.
[1:32:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us also
[1:32:29] go to second Kings chapter
[1:32:32] 9. And then verse
[1:32:35] 22, the Bible says, "And it came to pass
[1:32:39] when Joram saw Ju that he said, is it
[1:32:42] peace, Ju?" And he answered, "What peace
[1:32:46] so long as the wardoms of thy mother
[1:32:48] Jezebel and witchcrafts are so many?
[1:33:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Now look
[1:33:14] what Jezebel
[1:33:17] here. Jezebel
[1:33:20] was a beauty queen,
[1:33:26] very
[1:33:27] beautiful. No wonder
[1:33:30] Ahab had to fall for her.
[1:33:33] and she was a daughter of a
[1:33:37] king. Now
[1:33:40] Jezebel, the Bible
[1:33:45] says she was a
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:49] harot and she was a
[1:33:52] witch. Can you imagine that?
[1:33:56] Now like young
[1:34:00] brothers who are falling for
[1:34:07] beauty like
[1:34:09] Samson get this one for
[1:34:13] me I can't leave this
[1:34:17] one he got a lamposa
[1:34:31] outside
[1:34:33] very attractive
[1:34:35] but you don't know what is
[1:34:42] inside but inside it may
[1:34:48] be until you can't sit at
[1:34:55] home. How is your wife? Just leave. They
[1:35:00] are praising you, but you know you're
[1:35:05] burning.
[1:35:06] Burning burning.
[1:35:10] That was Jezebel.
[1:35:12] Very
[1:35:14] beautiful
[1:35:18] witch. So when she heard that Je was
[1:35:22] coming, did you know what she
[1:35:25] did? And you see the devil is a
[1:35:28] liar. In the midst of her looking
[1:35:32] nice, she was not
[1:35:35] contented. She said, "Let me paint
[1:35:37] herself.
[1:35:40] There is a woman who is always president
[1:35:42] in
[1:35:44] Uganda. Now she was saying I'm going to
[1:35:48] go for plastic
[1:35:54] surgery they reduce my breast size. You
[1:35:57] know the devil is a liar.
[1:36:00] Like I I think about five years or eight
[1:36:02] years
[1:36:04] ago there was a report on
[1:36:07] BBC report
[1:36:10] and then they were saying that the women
[1:36:13] in South Africa
[1:36:16] and the women
[1:36:18] Indonesia they are the women who use
[1:36:20] most of the skin lightening ingredients.
[1:36:27] But you go to
[1:36:28] Indonesia, they are light
[1:36:31] skinned, but they feel like it's not
[1:36:35] enough. Just want
[1:36:38] more. It's just the deception of the
[1:36:42] devil. And see, that's how the devil
[1:36:44] keeps on
[1:36:45] deceiving. And you know what Satan does
[1:36:48] is the moment you open a certain
[1:36:52] gate. Satan stands at the gates and he
[1:36:56] does
[1:37:00] admissions. This demon comes and passes.
[1:37:03] The other one comes and passes. Comes
[1:37:05] and passes. That's what the devil
[1:37:08] does. like a demon of fornication or
[1:37:14] adultery. It will stand at the gate if
[1:37:18] you don't chase it away. Then a demon of
[1:37:21] deception
[1:37:23] comes. You just know how to deceive and
[1:37:27] trick cover the other you have
[1:37:30] done. And as you keep on that
[1:37:33] demon, then a demon of murder
[1:37:37] comes and then it comes and sits
[1:37:41] here. That's what does he open the
[1:37:46] gate is the
[1:37:53] ad. You are part of us. You
[1:37:57] come. And the Bible says the last end of
[1:38:01] the
[1:38:03] person is worse than
[1:38:07] what? So now we shouldn't allow things
[1:38:09] which are wrong in our
[1:38:12] lives. Don't allow them. If you are
[1:38:16] doing them say Lord have mercy
[1:38:19] upon Lord deliver me out of
[1:38:21] this and then allow God to come and take
[1:38:24] over your life.
[1:38:27] Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:38:29] Jezebel, the Bible
[1:38:31] says she was a
[1:38:34] witch and a harot.
[1:38:36] Now when she saw Ju
[1:38:39] coming in 2 Kings chapter
[1:38:45] 22:30 and when Ju was come to Jezro
[1:38:49] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[1:38:53] face and trying tied her head and looked
[1:38:56] out at the window.
[1:39:00] 2 Kings chapter 9 rather verse 22 verse
[1:39:04] 30
[1:39:29] said she painted
[1:39:33] herself painted. Yes. And then you get
[1:39:37] some
[1:39:38] people green
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] here. They are green people.
[1:39:52] green. And then there are those who
[1:39:54] paint themselves like
[1:40:02] postcards. In
[1:40:05] 2015, there was a man in
[1:40:10] Algeria. He married a wife.
[1:40:14] and he spent about
[1:40:18] $20,000 and this woman would do make up
[1:40:22] like
[1:40:24] nothing and the man fell for the
[1:40:28] face arranged and they went for the
[1:40:31] wedding. So when he was with the
[1:40:33] wife the following
[1:40:36] day when he woke up in the
[1:40:40] morning he thought it was a
[1:40:45] thief and there was a
[1:40:48] scuffle because the face was not the
[1:40:52] same. Then the woman said I'm the wife.
[1:40:56] Why are you not the
[1:40:57] one? He took the woman to the court.
[1:41:03] said, "This is not the woman I
[1:41:06] married. The one I married look like
[1:41:08] this, but this one looks like this." So
[1:41:12] he says, "I want compensation for my
[1:41:19] 20,000, you know,
[1:41:22] paint, work
[1:41:24] upon there's a wedding we had here
[1:41:28] sometime and now sister.
[1:41:33] I wondered is this the person we know
[1:41:35] somebody
[1:41:39] totally
[1:41:41] different copper girl
[1:41:48] different.
[1:41:53] So that was
[1:41:55] Jezebel seducing
[1:41:59] Ju. And then verse 31. And as Ju entered
[1:42:03] in the gate, she said had Zim peace who
[1:42:06] threw his master.
[1:42:18] And he lifted up his face to the windows
[1:42:20] and said, "Who is on my side? And who?"
[1:42:23] And they looked out to him two or three
[1:42:41] uns. And he said, "Throw her down." So
[1:42:45] they threw her down. And some of her
[1:42:48] blood was sprinkled on the wall and on
[1:42:50] the horses, and it troed under foot.
[1:43:08] And when he came was come in, he did eat
[1:43:11] and drink and said, "Go see now this
[1:43:14] cast woman and bury her, for she is a
[1:43:17] king's daughter."
[1:43:31] He said cast
[1:43:34] woman. Why cast? Because of the things
[1:43:38] she was
[1:43:39] doing. So even God had pronounced
[1:43:42] judgment upon her.
[1:43:46] Now, why would I put myself in
[1:43:50] curses and think that I honor
[1:43:54] God? But yet, God expects
[1:43:57] us to live a
[1:43:59] life, that is
[1:44:02] virtuous, a life that is
[1:44:05] clean. Praise the name of how God
[1:44:09] expects us to live that kind of life.
[1:44:14] And you see we have challenges
[1:44:18] nowadays. Praise the name of our
[1:44:21] Lord. Like there's some somebody who
[1:44:24] sent me a message in the course of the
[1:44:27] week. And what is
[1:44:31] interesting, she used the husband's
[1:44:35] phone and sent me a message.
[1:44:39] And then the message was
[1:44:42] I don't know if I can get it.
[1:44:47] Let me try to look for it
[1:44:51] here. And
[1:44:54] then a
[1:44:58] woman sent the husband. Yeah. Sent the
[1:45:02] husband. Yes.
[1:45:06] An apple. the apple
[1:45:16] and said, "Darling, darling,
[1:45:23] take." Some people they are
[1:45:27] married but they have secret
[1:45:31] relationship with other women.
[1:45:37] They have some kind of you know romantic
[1:45:40] communication with
[1:45:44] others not their
[1:45:47] wives. They can show
[1:45:51] kindness but he's having a
[1:45:54] wife but then he's getting to another
[1:45:59] person so kind.
[1:46:03] No
[1:46:05] wonder they send support
[1:46:09] there. They are failing to do them at
[1:46:12] home but they're doing it for somebody
[1:46:15] else. And when they on
[1:46:18] phone there was also another
[1:46:21] sister. She timed when the husband had
[1:46:24] gone to either bathe or
[1:46:26] what then she got the
[1:46:29] message forwarded
[1:46:31] it said have you seen this man of man is
[1:46:35] having another
[1:46:39] woman you know we have a
[1:46:44] troubles
[1:46:45] somebody on their
[1:46:48] phones they have other relationships
[1:46:53] others I don't
[1:46:54] have. But as long as you're watching
[1:46:58] pornography, you're watching funny
[1:47:01] things, you have those same
[1:47:05] demons and you get this thing, it just
[1:47:08] keeps on eating
[1:47:10] somebody, eating
[1:47:12] somebody, no
[1:47:15] peace and then you find that there's a
[1:47:17] divide in the family.
[1:47:21] Because people are not
[1:47:23] sincere. People have started getting the
[1:47:25] things which are not
[1:47:27] right. Now the Bible
[1:47:30] says in Ephesians chapter
[1:47:34] 2 and then
[1:47:36] verse
[1:47:39] three. The Bible says among whom also we
[1:47:42] are all had our conversation the time
[1:47:45] passed in the lust of our flesh
[1:47:47] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:47:50] of the mind and we are by nature the
[1:47:52] children of wrath even as others
[1:48:13] It says we were in those
[1:48:16] things the lust of the
[1:48:18] flesh. Whatever your flesh wants, you
[1:48:22] just want to do it.
[1:48:24] Whatever you think about, you just want
[1:48:27] to do
[1:48:28] it, you need to be born
[1:48:30] again and then delivered from that kind
[1:48:33] of
[1:48:34] nature because that's the nature of
[1:48:38] Satan, you know, every time you are
[1:48:41] thinking of
[1:48:42] this, doing
[1:48:44] this, even when you are
[1:48:46] talking, your
[1:48:48] language is
[1:48:51] dirty, dirty words for you to mention a
[1:48:55] a bad word is not a
[1:48:57] problem because all the time in the
[1:49:00] mind all the time you're reading those
[1:49:03] data you are seeing those data you're
[1:49:06] hearing those data so you are feeding on
[1:49:10] that and when you feed on that you put
[1:49:14] out
[1:49:16] that see so you need to have respect for
[1:49:20] yourself you need to be born
[1:49:23] again, you need to be
[1:49:26] converted. But you see, your nature
[1:49:30] itself is
[1:49:32] converted is changed. Praise the name of
[1:49:35] our Lord. You need to do
[1:49:39] that. And now people who want to
[1:49:42] marry, don't be in a rush to marry
[1:49:44] somebody immediately.
[1:49:51] I want to marry immediately. Take time.
[1:49:53] Find out who they
[1:49:56] are. Take time. Praise the name of our
[1:49:59] Lord. Otherwise, you may be with that
[1:50:02] kind of
[1:50:05] person. The body can pretend to be with
[1:50:08] you, but the heart is somewhere else
[1:50:12] because they are not
[1:50:13] converted. Praise the name over. So we
[1:50:16] need to say that all these kind of
[1:50:19] things they are not part of
[1:50:21] us. Praise the name of our lord. We need
[1:50:24] to have
[1:50:27] respect for
[1:50:29] ourselves, the things we
[1:50:31] do, how we conduct
[1:50:33] ourselves, how we dress
[1:50:36] ourselves, how we
[1:50:37] talk. Praise the name of when you come
[1:50:40] into the presence of
[1:50:42] God, you are acceptable.
[1:50:46] Praise the name of God. You're not like
[1:50:48] Cain because the Bible says in Genesis
[1:50:52] chapter 4 that Cain, he was
[1:50:57] rejected. Even his
[1:50:59] offering was rejected. And so when we
[1:51:02] come into the presence of God, let us
[1:51:04] not come like
[1:51:06] Cain. Cain came into the presence of
[1:51:09] God to worship God. But God had no
[1:51:14] respect for
[1:51:15] Cain. Why? Because of his heart
[1:51:20] condition, evil
[1:51:22] thoughts, evil
[1:51:24] imagination, evil desires. So when we
[1:51:27] are coming into the presence of
[1:51:29] God, let us see that we throw away all
[1:51:32] those
[1:51:35] that praise the name of like on
[1:51:38] phone. Of course, you may be under many
[1:51:40] WhatsApp groups.
[1:51:43] WhatsApp. But if you know that the
[1:51:44] things sent on this
[1:51:47] forum which are dirty, why should I feed
[1:51:52] it? Why don't I
[1:51:55] delete? Why would your phone be full of
[1:51:57] dirty
[1:51:59] things? Why are you keeping them if you
[1:52:01] don't like
[1:52:03] them? Remove them. Praise the name of
[1:52:06] our Lord. Then you can be
[1:52:09] acceptable when you come before the
[1:52:11] presence of
[1:52:12] God. Your heart is
[1:52:14] right. You don't have that in your
[1:52:18] heart. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:52:20] because it matters a lot. How am I
[1:52:23] coming into the presence of
[1:52:25] God? Have I made myself right before
[1:52:29] God? Oh, I'm just coming to church as a
[1:52:32] casual occasion.
[1:52:36] I meant to be in charge then you come
[1:52:39] but are you acceptable before
[1:52:43] God and it's not difficult to be
[1:52:47] acceptable just apply the blood of Jesus
[1:52:50] Christ in whatever condition you are in
[1:52:53] allow the blood of Jesus
[1:52:56] Christ to come and take over
[1:53:00] your praise the name of
[1:53:04] Now a problem we have is coming late to
[1:53:09] church. Late
[1:53:12] coming and we have excuses for coming
[1:53:17] late. We have many
[1:53:20] excuses what you have not done in the
[1:53:23] week you do it on Sunday.
[1:53:28] But if you are coming to meet
[1:53:31] God, why don't you do things early
[1:53:35] enough to see that we are here at church
[1:53:38] in
[1:53:40] time. Praise the name of the Lord. See
[1:53:42] that we keep
[1:53:44] time. We give
[1:53:46] respect. If we have made appointment
[1:53:49] with
[1:53:50] God that by 9:30 we are meant to be in
[1:53:53] charge.
[1:53:56] We are going to be here 30 minutes
[1:53:57] before that
[1:54:01] time. You should be here at church. And
[1:54:05] when you come here to church, take time
[1:54:08] and
[1:54:10] meditate. Take time and
[1:54:13] pray. Take time and read the
[1:54:16] word. You are preparing your
[1:54:19] heart. The Lord will come and speak to
[1:54:21] you. Sometimes you have had troubles at
[1:54:24] home.
[1:54:26] The week has been so bad for
[1:54:28] you. Now it is your
[1:54:30] opportunity to tell God all your
[1:54:34] trouble problem. Then why don't you give
[1:54:37] it
[1:54:38] time? Praise the name of you have an
[1:54:43] interview. Do you go when the time has
[1:54:47] expired? You go much early. But then
[1:54:50] here you are coming to meet God.
[1:54:53] that you come in
[1:54:55] time. Start making your preparations on
[1:55:00] Saturday. Let your clothes be
[1:55:02] ready. You don't wake up in the morning.
[1:55:06] Then you have
[1:55:07] this your mind is completely
[1:55:11] troubled. So even by the time you come
[1:55:14] to
[1:55:14] church, you've forgotten your
[1:55:17] Bible. You've forgotten your
[1:55:20] notebook. You've forgotten this.
[1:55:24] You're just here for a show
[1:55:28] off, but your heart is not with the
[1:55:33] Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:55:35] let me say this, the things that we do
[1:55:38] at
[1:55:40] home. They'll never get
[1:55:43] exhausted. Never. But you have a limited
[1:55:47] time to be in the presence of God. Why
[1:55:51] don't you get good use of that
[1:55:53] time? And even when we come here in the
[1:55:56] presence of
[1:55:57] God, let us give the place of God
[1:56:02] respect and avoid coming making noise
[1:56:06] around. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:56:09] in the message, God being
[1:56:13] misunderstood, he says, "Brother Bill,
[1:56:17] please say something about both children
[1:56:19] and adults.
[1:56:24] Being so
[1:56:26] noisy, moving about during the
[1:56:30] service, the tabernacle needs some
[1:56:33] lessons in
[1:56:37] reverence. He says,
[1:56:40] "Amen."
[1:56:41] Children, do you not know how to obey
[1:56:44] yourself in the house of God?
[1:56:48] Do you not know this is the sancture of
[1:56:51] God? God is in his holy
[1:56:54] temple. Let
[1:56:57] everybody keep
[1:56:58] quiet. It is the place of
[1:57:01] God where people are
[1:57:04] coming
[1:57:07] meditating trying to find salvation to
[1:57:09] the
[1:57:11] soul trying to find problems of the
[1:57:14] people's lives.
[1:57:18] to help
[1:57:20] someone. The least you can
[1:57:22] do is be
[1:57:25] reverent. Be
[1:57:27] quiet. Get you a drink of water before
[1:57:30] church
[1:57:34] starts. I know little ones have to have
[1:57:38] drinks. Mothers that's got those little
[1:57:41] fellows. If you would sit near the back
[1:57:47] Keep them just as quiet as
[1:57:51] possible. And there should be never a
[1:57:56] whisper. Never one
[1:57:59] whisper. We are all
[1:58:02] guilty. But when that Bible is
[1:58:05] read and the minister enters the
[1:58:08] pulpit, we should be
[1:58:11] silent waiting on the Lord.
[1:58:15] Now please try to do
[1:58:18] that. Praise the name of Lord. You know
[1:58:20] when we come to church as we said at the
[1:58:24] beginning with different
[1:58:26] needs the other one this is his last
[1:58:30] opportunity. So don't grieve the Holy
[1:58:33] Spirit hindering the other person who is
[1:58:35] in
[1:58:37] need. Another one is sick. They need
[1:58:41] healing. So your conduct
[1:58:44] In effect they
[1:58:45] are you know receiving from God what
[1:58:49] they have come
[1:58:50] for. So you be with
[1:58:53] reverence. Brother Brandham was having
[1:58:55] the prayer
[1:58:57] life. He would tell the people be
[1:59:00] reverent. Don't walk up and
[1:59:03] down. You grieve the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:07] So then you need to see that when you
[1:59:09] come be
[1:59:12] reverent praise the name of you know not
[1:59:15] making
[1:59:16] noise speaking to this
[1:59:18] one passing on
[1:59:20] kids no be
[1:59:23] reverent and
[1:59:26] attentive praise the name of now that
[1:59:28] does not mean that you don't say
[1:59:31] amen what he has to
[1:59:37] It doesn't mean that. But when we come,
[1:59:40] we come with
[1:59:42] reverence. Praise the name of our Lord
[1:59:44] in the message church order.
[1:59:48] He says in 1963,
[1:59:51] he
[1:59:55] says, "Brethren, we are called, we
[1:59:58] called this meeting together here
[2:00:02] tonight for the purpose of
[2:00:06] knowing how to operate the church of the
[2:00:09] living
[2:00:11] God, which we believe to be part of this
[2:00:14] church.
[2:00:17] I want to first I want to first thing I
[2:00:23] want to say that in my travels around
[2:00:26] the
[2:00:28] world so far as I
[2:00:31] know this is one of the most spiritual
[2:00:34] places where you feel the spirit of
[2:00:41] God more than any other place I
[2:00:44] No, I had two other places in
[2:00:48] mind that used to
[2:00:50] be but so
[2:00:53] far they don't seem to see those
[2:01:00] places. One of them has just went into
[2:01:04] organization and the other has kind of
[2:01:08] fallen. He's talking about the quality
[2:01:11] of the spirit in the church.
[2:01:15] the presence of God in the church and
[2:01:18] then he's saying our
[2:01:21] church very spiritual and there was also
[2:01:24] another
[2:01:25] place but our
[2:01:29] fallen praise the name of so we need to
[2:01:32] see that we guard
[2:01:36] ourselves to see that we don't sink into
[2:01:40] error
[2:01:42] And if we have been in
[2:01:44] error, let us
[2:01:47] change. Praise the name of let us change
[2:01:49] the way we've been doing
[2:01:51] things. If I've been used coming to
[2:01:53] church at
[2:01:56] 11:00, let him change it. If I'm going
[2:01:59] to the school, do I report at
[2:02:04] 11? Sure. If I'm going to open my
[2:02:08] shop, do I open at midday?
[2:02:12] Then why is the place of
[2:02:14] God become
[2:02:19] dishonorable? I don't care the time I
[2:02:22] come. You know, we need to see that we
[2:02:25] change our
[2:02:27] ways, time
[2:02:29] keeping. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:02:32] You see that we come in
[2:02:34] time and you come in expectation.
[2:02:38] Lord, I've come in your
[2:02:40] presence. Lord, I'm here. And then you
[2:02:43] wait on the
[2:02:44] Lord. Praise the name of you. Wait on
[2:02:47] the Lord. And then don't first start
[2:02:50] roll
[2:02:57] calling. That's what has brought
[2:03:00] you. Wait on the
[2:03:02] Lord. Praise the name of our Lord and
[2:03:05] pray for them. Lord help my
[2:03:08] brother, help my
[2:03:10] sister. Praise the name of Lord. You
[2:03:13] know there are things which are not
[2:03:15] right like within this same week here.
[2:03:19] You know there are things you hear which
[2:03:20] are
[2:03:25] depressing. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:03:27] There are two places I
[2:03:29] heard and now I said Lord I don't know
[2:03:32] what to
[2:03:33] do. And then I just said what I have to
[2:03:35] do.
[2:03:37] is to intercede for these
[2:03:39] people. And I took time
[2:03:42] interceding. Praise the name of our
[2:03:44] Lord. And then one of them by
[2:03:48] yesterday the situation had
[2:03:50] changed. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:03:53] You know, you'll find that we need to
[2:03:55] intercede for one
[2:03:58] another. Like now there's a brother who
[2:04:00] was giving who was asking
[2:04:03] questions and he said God shows me
[2:04:06] things and when God shows me
[2:04:10] things and they happen to be true
[2:04:14] and they said God showed me something
[2:04:16] about a certain
[2:04:21] person and then brother Brandham was
[2:04:23] advising
[2:04:24] them well what you do if God shows you
[2:04:28] something about
[2:04:29] somebody go and talk it over to that
[2:04:33] person and do it in
[2:04:35] meekness and going there to
[2:04:38] rebuke God showed me
[2:04:41] this like this like this say show them
[2:04:45] in
[2:04:46] weakness they accept it is true of
[2:04:49] course you pray with them that God may
[2:04:50] deliver you but if they reject and it is
[2:04:54] true God himself will handle
[2:04:57] that. So we need to see that we stand
[2:05:00] for one
[2:05:02] another. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:05:05] And then he
[2:05:08] says, "Brethren, I'm sure that you don't
[2:05:10] realize
[2:05:13] that I've made this remark about this
[2:05:15] being a spiritual
[2:05:19] place. It isn't the biggest place in the
[2:05:22] world and it isn't what we have the most
[2:05:26] most singing.
[2:05:30] the most
[2:05:31] screaming, the most
[2:05:33] horroring or the most speaking in
[2:05:36] tong and things. That isn't
[2:05:39] it. But it is the quality of the
[2:05:44] spirit that operates in this
[2:05:49] tabernacle. Praise the name of God. And
[2:05:51] that's what we want. The quality of the
[2:05:54] spirit of God.
[2:05:58] You know the spirit of God coming in our
[2:06:01] medies speaking to us and when you know
[2:06:05] that you are in
[2:06:06] error Lord have mercy upon you don't try
[2:06:09] to
[2:06:11] defend and don't fight
[2:06:14] back don't do
[2:06:17] that and don't try to defend something
[2:06:21] wrong have my
[2:06:23] support I was doing this kind of thing
[2:06:26] and I didn't know it was wrong. Lord
[2:06:28] forgive me. Lord deliver
[2:06:30] me. Praise the name of the Lord. That
[2:06:33] shows that is a good
[2:06:35] ground because the Bible says the good
[2:06:39] ground are they in a
[2:06:45] good and honest
[2:06:48] heart. A honest heart is a repentant
[2:06:52] heart. Not that you're not going to make
[2:06:55] mistakes. You can make mistakes. But
[2:06:58] when I make
[2:06:59] mistakes, Lord have mercy upon me.
[2:07:02] That's a good ground. And so that brings
[2:07:05] the quiet of the
[2:07:07] spirit to be right. And so we create a
[2:07:11] good
[2:07:13] environment that sinners can be
[2:07:15] saved, sick people can be
[2:07:18] healed, people are longing, God can find
[2:07:21] him.
[2:07:23] our trouble can be
[2:07:25] settled. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:07:28] You know that we keep the presence of
[2:07:30] God with
[2:07:32] us. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[2:07:35] the message, God hiding himself in
[2:07:39] simplicity. He says, "And then the
[2:07:44] music sister, Sister Gi, sister, okay,
[2:07:47] she was talking about the sister in
[2:07:50] church. And then she says,
[2:07:55] She would be playing,
[2:07:59] you know, and she would play
[2:08:02] softly at the cross where my savior
[2:08:07] died. Real sweet soft
[2:08:10] music. And then until it comes for the
[2:08:13] time of the
[2:08:15] service and then the song leader got
[2:08:19] up and led a couple of congregational
[2:08:23] songs and then if they had some
[2:08:25] outstanding solo they sang
[2:08:28] it but not a bunch of carrying
[2:08:34] on. So even the quality of our song
[2:08:38] service matters a lot.
[2:08:42] Praise the name of God. Let us sing real
[2:08:45] godly
[2:08:49] music. Down at the cross where my Savior
[2:08:55] died. Praise the name of God. Not some
[2:08:58] of these chopped up
[2:09:07] songs until you got the discourse. They
[2:09:10] doing those
[2:09:12] same chopped
[2:09:16] songs. He washed me. He washed
[2:09:20] me. The one who saying that they was
[2:09:23] washed.
[2:09:25] What were you washed of?
[2:09:28] You're still in the
[2:09:29] bar. You're still in the You're still in
[2:09:32] line. No conviction in those songs. But
[2:09:35] let the song have a
[2:09:38] message. When somebody hears that
[2:09:41] song, it brings some kind of conviction
[2:09:45] in the
[2:09:46] heart. It draws the spirit of God
[2:09:51] nearer. Praise the name of real songs
[2:09:55] that can touch our soul.
[2:09:58] Praise the name of God. Something that
[2:10:00] you know will impact
[2:10:03] you and it changes your
[2:10:06] thinking, changes your mind,
[2:10:10] praise the name of our Lord and when the
[2:10:12] congregation gets to
[2:10:14] singing and when the music continually
[2:10:18] played and then when I heard that I know
[2:10:22] it was my time to come
[2:10:25] out. When a minister walks into the
[2:10:28] congregation of people praying in the
[2:10:30] anointing of the
[2:10:34] spirit, you are bound to hear from
[2:10:38] heaven. That is just
[2:10:41] all there is nowhere to keep from
[2:10:44] it. But if you walk into
[2:10:49] confusion, there you are
[2:10:52] confused. The spirit is grieved.
[2:10:56] So nothing much can be done in a
[2:10:59] service. People come in the service with
[2:11:01] their
[2:11:02] problems. They go back with their
[2:11:04] problem not
[2:11:07] delivered. So our conduct in church
[2:11:10] matters a
[2:11:13] lot. Praise the name of our Lord. How do
[2:11:16] we conduct
[2:11:17] ourselves in church? I think I'm not
[2:11:20] able to to go into everything.
[2:11:25] But let us talk about how we handle our
[2:11:30] children. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:11:33] How we handle our children in the
[2:11:37] church. You know, we need to see that
[2:11:39] these
[2:11:41] children when they are
[2:11:45] disciplined at home and at
[2:11:49] church. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:11:52] child running
[2:11:56] around. This is not a place for
[2:11:59] that. This is not a place for kids game
[2:12:04] playing. No. And let us teach this when
[2:12:07] they are still
[2:12:10] young that we are in church. We need to
[2:12:13] give God
[2:12:16] reverence. And parents should sit near
[2:12:19] their
[2:12:21] children. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:12:23] Watch over them, not make
[2:12:27] noise. Praise the name of our Lord. See
[2:12:30] that you sit with your
[2:12:31] children. You manage your children, not
[2:12:35] running, running up and
[2:12:37] down. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[2:12:40] in the message, God guiding himself in
[2:12:41] simplicity.
[2:12:44] He says now there is little
[2:12:47] children, little babies. Now they don't
[2:12:50] know no
[2:12:52] different. The only way they can get
[2:12:54] what they want is cry for
[2:12:58] it. And sometimes is a drink of
[2:13:01] water and sometimes they need
[2:13:04] attention. And so we have by the grace
[2:13:07] of
[2:13:09] God dedicated the room
[2:13:12] and it's called on the list a cry room.
[2:13:17] We have a cry room there.
[2:13:20] Praise the name of God. But then some
[2:13:22] people put it a sleeping
[2:13:26] place. When a mother is
[2:13:29] sleeping, one who is not a mother is
[2:13:31] also here hiding herself there.
[2:13:35] for
[2:13:36] babies. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[2:13:39] us put everything in its
[2:13:43] position. Praise the name of Lord. And
[2:13:46] that place I believe it's not
[2:13:49] enough. But if my baby if I'm not
[2:13:51] feeding my baby from
[2:13:53] there, I'm not breastfeeding my baby
[2:13:56] from there. I'm not laying the baby down
[2:13:59] there, why should I make it my permanent
[2:14:02] place? And you can sit
[2:14:06] sit and you can sit near another
[2:14:09] mother and you start conversation.
[2:14:13] Today the service is going to end at
[2:14:15] what times?
[2:14:17] It's already it's already
[2:14:20] one. No, we have come to meet
[2:14:24] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[2:14:27] put order there.
[2:14:30] Why would I my permanent
[2:14:34] place? This is my corner. How about the
[2:14:37] people have just given
[2:14:41] birth? Where are you going to admit
[2:14:44] them? Praise the name of Lord. So then
[2:14:48] he
[2:14:51] says, but it's right straight in front
[2:14:53] of
[2:14:54] me. In other words, where mothers can
[2:14:58] take their
[2:15:00] baby. Now, it never bothers me maybe
[2:15:03] here at the
[2:15:05] pit. Maybe I won't even notice
[2:15:08] it being
[2:15:10] anointed, but there are other people
[2:15:12] sitting
[2:15:14] near and it bothers
[2:15:17] them and they come to hear the service.
[2:15:24] So even as a parent, let me be conscious
[2:15:28] about my
[2:15:30] neighbor. If you have a stubborn
[2:15:33] kid, why do you want that kid spoil the
[2:15:36] service for the
[2:15:38] others? You know, there are kids who are
[2:15:41] just
[2:15:43] stubborn. Brother, I'm saying if they
[2:15:46] can't behave in
[2:15:47] church, take them home until they learn
[2:15:50] to
[2:15:50] be not to spoil the service.
[2:15:55] Like we had a scenario
[2:15:57] here to change the
[2:16:05] seat to another place because of another
[2:16:08] mother with a baby whatever
[2:16:12] happened we need to give respect to
[2:16:16] others that as I've come to hear from
[2:16:19] God be
[2:16:21] concerned that even this brother next to
[2:16:24] me, this sister next to
[2:16:27] me
[2:16:29] from the spirit of Christ is for you to
[2:16:33] desire the other person to have the
[2:16:37] best
[2:16:42] right. How do you live for another
[2:16:46] person? Praise the name of So we need to
[2:16:48] see that we we do things rightly.
[2:16:53] Then he says,
[2:16:55] "So, so the
[2:16:57] mothers if the little baby starts
[2:17:02] whispering, you can't help
[2:17:05] that." Sure. You should, you ought to
[2:17:09] bring
[2:17:10] it. A real
[2:17:12] mother want to take the baby to
[2:17:15] church and that's the thing you should
[2:17:18] do. And we've got a room
[2:17:20] there where you can see every corner of
[2:17:24] the
[2:17:26] building or the
[2:17:28] auditorium and the speaker there where
[2:17:32] you can control the volume
[2:17:37] anyway you want
[2:17:39] to then a little in the end.
[2:17:43] He was describing the arrangement of the
[2:17:45] church and he says all put there for the
[2:17:48] mother's
[2:17:50] convenience. Then he says and then many
[2:17:54] times teenage
[2:17:57] children and sometimes
[2:18:00] adults will
[2:18:02] get you know young people will pass
[2:18:05] notes or cut something in the
[2:18:09] church. Now you are old enough to know
[2:18:11] better than that.
[2:18:14] You should know better than
[2:18:16] that. You shouldn't come here if you
[2:18:19] expect to be a real man
[2:18:23] someday and raise a family to the
[2:18:25] kingdom of
[2:18:27] God and then start it off in the
[2:18:31] beginning and act right and do
[2:18:35] right. Now the ashers stand at the
[2:18:38] corners of the
[2:18:41] building and if any carrying
[2:18:44] on they are ordained as their
[2:18:48] duty and it transisted here in the
[2:18:53] front that in case of someone getting
[2:18:58] misbehaving they are commissioned to ask
[2:19:01] that person to keep
[2:19:04] quiet. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:19:07] we need to say that we are in
[2:19:10] order doing the things
[2:19:14] right. Now he was saying this in March
[2:19:18] 1963 but in
[2:19:21] December some people refused to follow
[2:19:24] what was being said.
[2:19:28] Now in the message church order in
[2:19:33] 1963 he says brother Brham with respect
[2:19:36] to the order of the
[2:19:38] church we have tried to go accordingly
[2:19:41] to the way we understand the orders
[2:19:44] given in dedication of the new
[2:19:49] church and by doing
[2:19:51] so some have gotten
[2:19:55] mad and left the church.
[2:19:58] and others will not listen to anything
[2:20:01] we
[2:20:02] say especially the children. We have
[2:20:05] talk to the parents about their
[2:20:08] children and they won't take care of
[2:20:12] them now. Have we
[2:20:16] misunderstood or are we going about in
[2:20:18] the wrong
[2:20:19] way? Then he say
[2:20:21] thanks. Then he says now let me answer
[2:20:24] this one as they come down.
[2:20:28] In respect to order of the
[2:20:31] church, we are trying to go according to
[2:20:34] the way we understand it given in the
[2:20:36] dedication of the new
[2:20:41] church. Now that is correct. You are
[2:20:45] doing right now. This is supposed to be
[2:20:49] deacons. I suppose right here at the
[2:20:55] job and by doing so we have often people
[2:20:59] has gotten mad at
[2:21:02] us they do it at me
[2:21:06] too they do that at any
[2:21:09] man a person that does
[2:21:12] that there is something wrong with that
[2:21:16] person they are not right with
[2:21:19] God. For the spirit of
[2:21:22] Christ is subject to Christ's
[2:21:26] teaching. Christ is house. Christ is
[2:21:30] order. Any man, any woman, any persons,
[2:21:36] your children that would get
[2:21:39] angry with a godly
[2:21:43] deacon that would tell them to
[2:21:47] be, any parent that will get angry with
[2:21:50] the
[2:21:51] deacon.
[2:21:54] Really, we want everybody in this
[2:21:57] church that we can get
[2:22:01] But if you would only cause trouble
[2:22:04] somewhere
[2:22:06] else, there is a
[2:22:09] thorn or a rabbit in the wood pile. As
[2:22:13] we used to
[2:22:17] say, that person isn't
[2:22:20] right. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[2:22:23] us follow
[2:22:25] instructions. Praise the name of our
[2:22:26] Lord. like now why would I come and sit
[2:22:30] with the babies who are disturbing all
[2:22:31] the time in
[2:22:34] front why don't I go back in the back
[2:22:37] there praise the name of the lord they
[2:22:40] are
[2:22:40] interfering all the time this all
[2:22:43] the I remember there's a
[2:22:47] time I was sitting in front here and
[2:22:51] then there was a child I'm forgetting
[2:22:52] the
[2:22:53] child all the time going
[2:22:55] up going
[2:22:58] I told him, "Don't go out if you want to
[2:23:01] sit
[2:23:06] here." Yeah, we should be able to
[2:23:08] correct these
[2:23:13] children. You don't talk about it.
[2:23:16] Praise the name of our Lord. It's the
[2:23:18] house of
[2:23:19] God. Somebody's doing
[2:23:21] wrong. Tell them you're doing wrong.
[2:23:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And if we
[2:23:27] have the spirit of
[2:23:28] God, you should be
[2:23:31] obedient and even the parent not just
[2:23:34] defend your
[2:23:36] children. You are doing something
[2:23:39] wrong because that spirit can
[2:23:42] grow and can be a problem at your
[2:23:48] house. So that we show the children the
[2:23:51] way of the Lord.
[2:23:54] and be obedient to the
[2:23:57] direction. Praise the name of God. Then
[2:24:00] in paragraph
[2:24:01] 83, he says, "Others will not listen to
[2:24:05] anything we
[2:24:08] say, especially the children paragraph
[2:24:13] 84, he says, the children are supposed
[2:24:17] to know
[2:24:19] discipline. They should get it at home.
[2:24:24] Amen. Amen. As
[2:24:26] parents, we have that
[2:24:28] responsibility. Teaching our children
[2:24:33] discipline. Praise the name of Allah.
[2:24:36] Teaching our children
[2:24:38] discipline. Because at the end of the
[2:24:40] day, they reflect on you as a
[2:24:44] parent. How have you raised your
[2:24:49] children? Child has done this.
[2:24:55] They reflect on your character as a
[2:24:59] parent. When you come with them to
[2:25:02] church, tell
[2:25:04] them no moving up and
[2:25:06] down. No playing
[2:25:09] around. They have come to church and
[2:25:12] we're not here the whole
[2:25:14] day. You've come at 9. you're living at
[2:25:18] at at
[2:25:19] 1, 3 hours, 4
[2:25:22] hours. When they in their
[2:25:24] classes, you mean they get out all the
[2:25:26] time going for short
[2:25:28] calls? No. But then as parents, we to
[2:25:33] discipline our
[2:25:41] children. And then some parents, their
[2:25:44] children cannot hear what they saying.
[2:25:47] When the parent is talking like this,
[2:25:48] the child is
[2:25:49] screaming. There's something wrong with
[2:25:51] the
[2:25:52] parent. How are you raising your
[2:25:55] children? What are you raising
[2:25:58] up which cannot be
[2:26:01] governed? If for you as a parent you are
[2:26:04] failing, how would they be governed at
[2:26:07] school if they finished school? How they
[2:26:10] be governed at the places
[2:26:12] of comes anytime he wants.
[2:26:16] chest is
[2:26:17] open. There will be no job for such a
[2:26:20] person. However, they may
[2:26:26] be discipline matters a lot. And it is
[2:26:30] the
[2:26:31] parents that put discipline in their
[2:26:35] children. Now, if the child is failing
[2:26:37] to obey the simple
[2:26:41] instructions, keep quiet.
[2:26:45] [Applause]
[2:26:46] Ah, something wrong.
[2:26:49] You can't tell your child to keep
[2:26:51] quiet and they just scream, scream,
[2:26:53] scream, scream and then you get those
[2:26:56] children who are beating their
[2:26:58] parents.
[2:27:01] Hey, it's a terrible situation. If the
[2:27:04] child can afford to beat the parent as
[2:27:07] small as they
[2:27:09] are, how about when they go to other
[2:27:11] people's
[2:27:13] hands and now when they go to a
[2:27:17] maid doesn't have that care you
[2:27:24] have but as parents he says we should
[2:27:27] discipline these
[2:27:30] children we should get discipline at
[2:27:33] home.
[2:27:35] So as a parent it is your
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:40] responsibility not anybody's
[2:27:43] responsible. Praise the name of our
[2:27:45] lord. Let us see that we have the
[2:27:47] conduct of the children which is right.
[2:27:52] when we come into the
[2:27:53] present. Then he
[2:27:55] says, "But even if it is
[2:27:59] mine, my kids get in here at any time
[2:28:05] they get
[2:28:07] disorderly. I don't want you to draw one
[2:28:09] string.
[2:28:14] Sarah, Sarah, Rebecca, Joseph, Billy,
[2:28:19] whosoever it might
[2:28:20] be, you tell
[2:28:23] me, I will see to it. If they can't
[2:28:27] behave, then they will stay away from
[2:28:31] church till they learn to
[2:28:34] behave. This is not an arena.
[2:28:40] This is the house of God. This is not a
[2:28:44] place to
[2:28:45] play
[2:28:47] skating, writing
[2:28:49] notes,
[2:28:51] laugh and cut up. This is the house of
[2:28:56] God and is to be carried out
[2:29:00] godly. We come here to
[2:29:04] worship, not even to visit.
[2:29:07] This is not a picnic
[2:29:11] ground. This is not a vistation
[2:29:14] place. This is the vistation place of
[2:29:16] the Holy
[2:29:18] Spirit. Listen to what he says to
[2:29:24] say, not to one
[2:29:27] another. We don't come
[2:29:30] here to fellowship with one
[2:29:33] another. We come here to fellowship with
[2:29:35] Christ.
[2:29:37] This is the house of
[2:29:39] worship and children see that we do
[2:29:44] everything how the Lord would want us to
[2:29:47] do. Now in the message God hiding
[2:29:50] himself in his place. He said remember
[2:29:53] love is
[2:29:55] corrective always genuine love is
[2:30:00] corrective. So you must be able to stand
[2:30:08] And man
[2:30:10] know now that there is a place there for
[2:30:14] babies. You young children no different
[2:30:17] than to run around the
[2:30:19] building and you adults no different
[2:30:22] than to talk and carry all your
[2:30:23] conversation in the in the auditorium.
[2:30:30] See, don't do that. It is wrong. It is
[2:30:35] displeasing to
[2:30:38] God. Jesus said, it's written, "My house
[2:30:42] shall be a house of
[2:30:45] worship called the house of prayer by
[2:30:48] all
[2:30:50] nations." And they were buying and
[2:30:53] selling. And he plated ropes and read
[2:30:55] the people out of the
[2:30:58] auditorium. And we certainly don't want
[2:31:01] that to happen in this sanctuary
[2:31:03] here. So let us dedicate our
[2:31:06] lives, our church, our tasks, our
[2:31:11] service, and everything we have to the
[2:31:15] kingdom of
[2:31:16] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[2:31:19] see how we behave
[2:31:21] ourselves. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:31:23] And when the service is
[2:31:25] over, praise the name of our Lord. Let
[2:31:27] us keep this place
[2:31:29] still
[2:31:32] sanctified. Not talking around, running
[2:31:36] to and fro things like that. Let us have
[2:31:40] respect for this place. I want to talk
[2:31:42] to somebody out and do that. Praise the
[2:31:47] name of our Lord. We are here at church.
[2:31:50] Why would I hold a meeting when the
[2:31:52] service is going on?
[2:31:56] The word is being preached but I'm
[2:31:59] conversing
[2:32:00] outside. What program do you have for
[2:32:02] this
[2:32:03] week? What have you come to
[2:32:07] do? Let us as long as the service is
[2:32:11] on. Let us all be
[2:32:14] attentive because it's the spirit of
[2:32:17] God speaking to us. Praise the name of
[2:32:20] the Lord. So you have also come to be
[2:32:22] helped.
[2:32:24] But how are you going to be helped when
[2:32:27] you're not there to be helped?
[2:32:29] So we need to see that we give respect.
[2:32:33] Praise the name of our Lord, we give
[2:32:36] respect that when the service is
[2:32:38] on attentive into the service of
[2:32:41] God and then we come to the
[2:32:44] church, why don't you come with your
[2:32:46] Bible? Why don't you come with your
[2:32:48] notebook? Why don't you come with your
[2:32:50] pain and write something down? Then you
[2:32:54] go back and meditate upon
[2:32:56] this. That's why the Bible says the
[2:33:00] people of
[2:33:01] Belair they did
[2:33:03] better when they had they went home and
[2:33:08] read the things. And the Bible says many
[2:33:11] of them were converted. In other words,
[2:33:15] they were
[2:33:16] delivered when they come to church.
[2:33:20] attentive
[2:33:22] listening, go back home, take time, read
[2:33:26] this, hear the
[2:33:28] steps, and then God worked mighty in
[2:33:31] their
[2:33:33] lives. And this is what we want in our
[2:33:35] lives, praise the name of that when I
[2:33:38] come to church, I come to feed from the
[2:33:41] spirit of
[2:33:42] God. Then you listen, take time to be
[2:33:48] attentive and hear these things. I talk
[2:33:52] to them in my
[2:33:53] family. Praise the name of Lord. And
[2:33:56] then you see how the Lord can work out
[2:33:57] in your
[2:33:59] life. You have been having this kind of
[2:34:02] weakness and you see that weakness, you
[2:34:05] overcome
[2:34:06] it. You've been having the other kind of
[2:34:09] weakness. The other weakness, you
[2:34:11] overcome it.
[2:34:13] Praise the name of our Lord so that we
[2:34:15] can allow the spirit of
[2:34:17] God to work in our lives. Praise the
[2:34:20] name of our Lord. So our conduct in
[2:34:24] church matters a
[2:34:27] lot. It matters a lot. Let us have
[2:34:31] respect when we come to the service of
[2:34:33] the
[2:34:34] Lord. How I
[2:34:36] dress, let me have
[2:34:39] respect. Praise the name of Lord. And
[2:34:41] then there was a scenario,
[2:34:44] praise the name
[2:34:46] of some sister came to church, sister
[2:34:50] without a pet, a pet coat
[2:34:56] coming to
[2:34:58] church. I didn't see it myself, but I
[2:35:00] heard
[2:35:03] it. Are you here? I said, hey, can you
[2:35:05] imagine that sister coming to church
[2:35:06] without a pet?
[2:35:10] say, "Hey, very
[2:35:12] strange. There is a school there
[2:35:15] in they told the
[2:35:19] girls, please come with pett
[2:35:24] coats." Ah, we have
[2:35:27] bikers. We want
[2:35:29] pets secondary
[2:35:32] schoolary. And then the children told
[2:35:34] the teachers, "Our mothers, they don't
[2:35:37] wear coats.
[2:35:41] Then the teachers told
[2:35:43] them for us what we want here are
[2:35:46] pets. Now if a school can do such a
[2:35:50] thing, how about a
[2:35:53] Christian? But you can
[2:35:56] imagine there's another
[2:35:59] school. They went and said you are
[2:36:02] coming for
[2:36:04] visitation. And then they put the rules
[2:36:09] We don't want this kind of people to
[2:36:10] come to our
[2:36:13] school. They put they find these
[2:36:15] dresses,
[2:36:17] funny hair
[2:36:19] skirts, said you are not welcome to our
[2:36:21] school. So when you go to the gate, you
[2:36:24] come out, they check how are you
[2:36:28] dressed, then you enter. If a secular
[2:36:31] school can do such a
[2:36:33] thing without
[2:36:36] God but people just do the way they want
[2:36:38] to do
[2:36:40] things. Somebody just comes the way they
[2:36:42] want to
[2:36:44] come if the world is saying this is
[2:36:49] wrong. How will the world react to
[2:36:53] that? Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[2:36:55] need to learn how to conduct ourselves.
[2:37:00] Praise the name of our Lord. How to
[2:37:02] conduct ourselves in the presence of
[2:37:06] God. The Bible says, let us finish with
[2:37:09] 1 Timothy chapter
[2:37:11] 3 where we
[2:37:14] write. We shall continue with church
[2:37:16] order next Sunday. Be gracious.
[2:37:20] He says, "But if I
[2:37:23] tell
[2:37:25] 3:15, that thou mayest know how you
[2:37:29] ought to behave thyself in the house of
[2:37:38] God, which is the church of the living
[2:37:42] God, the pillar and the ground of
[2:37:45] truth."
[2:37:48] Praise the name of you know every
[2:37:51] place there is there are levels of
[2:37:55] conduct even in the public service here
[2:37:57] in
[2:37:59] Uganda Uganda our government they put
[2:38:03] dress
[2:38:05] code and acceptable
[2:38:10] conduct this one is not a
[2:38:12] market we dress any how we
[2:38:16] We conduct ourselves anywhere we
[2:38:19] want. God demands
[2:38:22] respect. Praise the name of God demands
[2:38:25] respect from
[2:38:27] us. How we approach
[2:38:29] him matters a lot. Praise the name of
[2:38:33] our Lord. How you're dressed matters.
[2:38:36] Unless when you don't know. But if you
[2:38:39] have known, don't do it again.
[2:38:43] Praise the name of God. You do it again
[2:38:46] so that you do better to please the
[2:38:49] Lord so that you are
[2:38:52] acceptable before the Lord. May God
[2:38:55] bless you so
[2:38:56] much. Amen.
[2:38:59] Amen. As the song leader
[2:39:02] comes, let us sing that song. We walk in
[2:39:05] the
[2:39:06] light. And when we walk in the light,
[2:39:10] the light exposes our dark places.
[2:39:15] And we live the works of
[2:39:18] darkness. Praise the name of our
[2:39:20] Lord. We walk in the
[2:39:24] light. Beautiful
[2:39:28] light where the drops of mercy are
[2:39:34] bright. Shine all around us by day and

[2:41:35] are Jesus.
[2:41:41] Why you not seek him
[2:41:43] today? Why don't seek him?
[2:41:49] Jesus.
[2:41:52] Jesus the light of God.
[2:41:59] Oh, with truth from the
[2:42:03] narrow
[2:42:05] way.
[2:42:07] Jesus, light of the world. We walk in,
