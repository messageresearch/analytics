[1:17:39] special
[1:17:40] way just the same way you've been
[1:17:43] together with
[1:17:44] us we pray that you may even magnify
[1:17:47] your presence
[1:17:49] today in Jesus name amen so let's turn
[1:17:54] to Second Timothy chter
[1:17:59] 4 amen second Timothy chter
[1:18:04] 4 and verse
[1:18:07] two these are instructions from
[1:18:11] Paul to
[1:18:13] Timothy he tells
[1:18:15] Timothy preach the
[1:18:18] word be instant in season
[1:18:25] and out of
[1:18:26] season
[1:18:28] reprove
[1:18:30] rebuke exalt with all long
[1:18:34] suffering and
[1:18:37] doctr so he's telling this young
[1:18:41] man don't be very Hy in doing
[1:18:50] things he says all this do it
[1:18:55] with long
[1:18:56] suffering brother Bram
[1:18:59] says for over 30
[1:19:01] years he had been preaching to
[1:19:05] Sisters not to cut their hair and he
[1:19:08] says have they
[1:19:11] stopped he says with all long
[1:19:17] suffering and
[1:19:18] doctr God bless the service today you
[1:19:22] may be seated
[1:19:25] so I've got a
[1:19:28] very
[1:19:30] uh interesting title out of this
[1:19:37] scripture it
[1:19:38] is
[1:19:42] now and the
[1:19:45] prophetic
[1:19:47] now and the
[1:19:51] prophetic so Timothy's Church to preach
[1:19:54] the
[1:19:56] word and to be
[1:20:00] instant and to be instant
[1:20:03] means that he should be found doing
[1:20:09] so being
[1:20:12] instant both in
[1:20:15] season and out of
[1:20:17] season to be
[1:20:20] instant to be
[1:20:22] constant to be found
[1:20:25] ready to be in
[1:20:29] season is to bring forth what Peter
[1:20:32] called the present
[1:20:38] truth Amen in second Peter chter
[1:20:42] 1 and verse
[1:20:44] 12 he says wherefore I will not be
[1:20:50] negligent to put you always in
[1:20:52] remembrance of these things
[1:20:56] though you know
[1:20:58] them and be established in the present
[1:21:05] truth so while all scripture is
[1:21:09] truth there is what Peter is referring
[1:21:13] to as present
[1:21:17] truth because it is present
[1:21:20] Tru when we read Isaiah
[1:21:26] 14 that a virgin shall
[1:21:31] conceive much as is
[1:21:33] truth is not present
[1:21:36] truth when we read about
[1:21:39] Moses Leading The
[1:21:42] Exodus it is truth but it is not present
[1:21:48] truth so Peter says of all the entire
[1:21:52] Bible
[1:21:54] from
[1:21:55] Genesis to
[1:21:57] Revelation find
[1:21:59] yourself so that you may always stand in
[1:22:04] season amen and present the present
[1:22:07] truth to the
[1:22:09] people
[1:22:11] brother
[1:22:13] message entitles entitled recognizing
[1:22:17] your
[1:22:18] day and its
[1:22:21] message amen when you that
[1:22:25] message he's saying that you must come
[1:22:29] to a
[1:22:30] spot where you standing the present
[1:22:33] tense in your
[1:22:35] Fai that is the
[1:22:38] now amen that's why I called it
[1:22:42] now you should not the very
[1:22:46] hour and time and sign and message that
[1:22:52] you are living
[1:22:55] amen but then there's the prophetic part
[1:22:59] of the
[1:23:01] ministry Amen brother Bram says you know
[1:23:06] he preached a message like things that
[1:23:09] are to
[1:23:10] be future
[1:23:12] home talk to the
[1:23:15] Rapture amen the new home and all
[1:23:18] things so Timothy was
[1:23:23] admonished to be instant in
[1:23:27] both Amen in the
[1:23:30] now and the
[1:23:32] prophetic the people to
[1:23:34] know what they live
[1:23:37] for and live
[1:23:39] by in the present tense and also help
[1:23:43] the people to know where they are going
[1:23:46] to put their
[1:23:48] next is that amen so that's what Paul
[1:23:52] means
[1:23:55] in
[1:23:56] season and out of
[1:23:58] season so every
[1:24:01] Ministry Works in both
[1:24:04] seasons and out of the
[1:24:08] Season means that every
[1:24:11] ministry will have a prophetic element
[1:24:15] in
[1:24:17] it much as Timo you are not a
[1:24:21] prophet but you must stand in
[1:24:25] season and out of
[1:24:28] season not the M didn't explain very
[1:24:31] well in season you have to bring the
[1:24:34] people to their
[1:24:38] present out of
[1:24:40] season you must help them look into the
[1:24:44] future so all the Ministries are like
[1:24:48] that so when we come to
[1:24:51] church we should watch with inent
[1:24:56] statement that the Holy Spirit brings
[1:24:59] before
[1:25:00] us some of
[1:25:02] it is in season and some of it is a
[1:25:07] future
[1:25:09] reference praise the Lord so the Holy
[1:25:13] Ghost knows those things that
[1:25:17] were and those that
[1:25:20] are and those that are to come and now
[1:25:24] is exactly the
[1:25:26] same much as he has known everything
[1:25:29] along the course of
[1:25:32] time but still the Holy Spirit
[1:25:36] knows everything about you he knows your
[1:25:40] past he knows your present he knows your
[1:25:44] future so when he begins to
[1:25:47] minister he may speak and address you
[1:25:53] practically and looks like the
[1:25:56] ministry was with you at
[1:25:59] home because you come down here for God
[1:26:03] to deal with your
[1:26:05] life and sometimes things are
[1:26:09] sa which you may even question why would
[1:26:12] have Pastor said such a
[1:26:15] thing you just don't need to discard
[1:26:20] it because it may be in your
[1:26:27] so we serve a God who knows today who
[1:26:31] knows
[1:26:32] tomorrow and who knows everything is the
[1:26:36] same yesterday today and
[1:26:39] forever amen the Holy Ghost is the
[1:26:44] prophet but he only uses
[1:26:47] versus to prophesy so I want take you
[1:26:51] down
[1:26:52] here into the book of
[1:26:55] Revelation Chapter 19 Verse
[1:26:58] 6 we are going to look at a few
[1:27:01] scriptures
[1:27:02] here and we pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:27:06] may help us to internalize them so
[1:27:11] Revelation
[1:27:12] 19
[1:27:14] verse and I heard as it
[1:27:19] were I heard as it were the voice of a
[1:27:23] great mouth
[1:27:27] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:27:35] Waters and as the voice of
[1:27:41] munder saying
[1:27:44] hallelujah for the Lord
[1:27:51] God nown not hear
[1:27:56] voices but you know he had a single
[1:28:04] voice but it was as the voice of many
[1:28:11] Waters meaning that these
[1:28:14] voices were blending into one
[1:28:19] voice as the
[1:28:21] voice of many Waters
[1:28:24] and this voice here is certainly the
[1:28:27] voice of
[1:28:29] Christ but the voice of
[1:28:32] Christ was coming
[1:28:34] through from so many different
[1:28:38] vessels but it has always been one
[1:28:41] voice that's the voice of Christ PA was
[1:28:46] that voice Mar was that voice and even
[1:28:50] the local
[1:28:52] Ministry is The Voice of Christ even you
[1:28:56] also when you were anointed in a certain
[1:28:59] way in times of
[1:29:02] fell we speak as Christ
[1:29:06] speakers is the voice of many
[1:29:09] Waters verse seven let us be glad and
[1:29:14] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:29:18] marriage of the Lamb is
[1:29:21] come and his wife has made us
[1:29:25] and her to her was
[1:29:28] granted that she should be
[1:29:31] arrayed in fine
[1:29:33] L clean and
[1:29:37] white for the fine linen is the
[1:29:39] righteousness of the
[1:29:43] Saints and he says unto me
[1:29:47] right blessed are they which are called
[1:29:51] unto the marriage of the L
[1:29:55] and he said unto me these are the true
[1:29:58] sayings of
[1:30:00] God my my my praise the Lord now
[1:30:05] John was not in the
[1:30:08] now John was in the
[1:30:13] prophetic you cannot take it
[1:30:16] away you see when people
[1:30:19] believe they need something to keep them
[1:30:22] in their daily work
[1:30:26] but then there must also be
[1:30:28] something that should keep their hopes
[1:30:32] going you understand what I mean look at
[1:30:36] what sand has been
[1:30:38] singing she has a mind about her
[1:30:41] father but she has the
[1:30:44] prophetic there will be a meeting in the
[1:30:48] end are you together with me so now
[1:30:51] listen to verse 10
[1:30:54] and I fell at his feet to worship
[1:30:58] him and said and he said unto me see

[1:31:10] servant and of thy
[1:31:12] Brethren that have the testimony of

[1:31:32] spirit of
[1:31:34] Christ is I mean the testimony of
[1:31:37] Christ is the spirit of

[1:34:01] fire and his feet like
[1:34:04] brass burn in the
[1:34:07] furnace and his voice the sound of many
[1:34:14] Waters this
[1:34:16] means that is

[1:34:25] one voice the voice of the
[1:34:29] word amen I can never preach
[1:34:33] anything different than what the word
[1:34:37] is and since Christ is the
[1:34:40] word when I preach the word I'm also

[1:36:54] amen tides

[1:37:31] voice is the
[1:37:34] Judgment the voice of the
[1:37:36] minister through the Holy

[1:38:23] son of
[1:38:27] man are you together with me say Amen
[1:38:31] somebody so all these
[1:38:34] voices were summed

[1:39:00] testimony testimony of Jesus
[1:39:03] Christ the voice of many
[1:39:06] Waters yet One Voice which is the voice
[1:39:10] of Jesus Christ so the testimony of
[1:39:13] Jesus
[1:39:14] Christ is the spirit of
[1:39:19] Prophecy so as I
[1:39:22] preach I would say as I
[1:39:25] prophesy I have to be

[1:39:30] season and out of
[1:39:35] season to present you the
[1:39:38] present and to give you the hope of the

[1:40:11] committed to the voice of many wers they
[1:40:15] are like drifting
[1:40:20] Souls they do not know how to station
[1:40:25] themselves on the sea of
[1:40:30] life God desires
[1:40:33] us to find our
[1:40:36] position and align
[1:40:39] ourselves with the ministry of the Holy
[1:40:42] Spirit he says what a horrible
[1:40:46] thing for drifting
[1:40:48] Soul the Sea of Life their rejection of
[1:40:53] the
[1:40:54] voices of many
[1:40:57] Waters
[1:41:01] is when you don't
[1:41:04] submit and
[1:41:05] subject to the voice which is the voice
[1:41:09] of Christ is
[1:41:12] atonment your joy is to open up for the
[1:41:16] world and whenever the word is preached
[1:41:20] just say Amen father that is mine
[1:41:24] hallelujah hallelujah that's what we
[1:41:26] need so that we can
[1:41:29] stabilize on the sea of
[1:41:33] life you should not be a lose
[1:41:38] Soul floating with the
[1:41:41] time every wind of
[1:41:45] doctr he says
[1:41:48] what be a drifting soul
[1:41:53] amen so we preach for
[1:41:57] now bringing people to recogize the
[1:42:02] finished work
[1:42:04] of to bring the people into
[1:42:08] repentance to straighten up their
[1:42:11] lives from the sinful Gentile
[1:42:16] Traditions to set forth
[1:42:20] precepts of work
[1:42:23] in the present now to break
[1:42:28] codes to break
[1:42:31] codes you know all you know with the
[1:42:34] works of the
[1:42:36] flesh that's now that Ministry putting
[1:42:40] you into the
[1:42:43] now because if we don't have it
[1:42:47] now then we are not part of the
[1:42:51] prophetic are you together with me amen
[1:42:54] Galatians
[1:42:56] 5 amen because this is the
[1:43:00] now to break a
[1:43:02] codes Amen to set ourselves
[1:43:06] free because if the codes are holding
[1:43:10] us amen a voice will keep calling you up
[1:43:16] higher but then you were
[1:43:19] stuck and now Paul tells Timo
[1:43:23] release the
[1:43:24] people from the things that hold
[1:43:28] them
[1:43:30] instance preaching
[1:43:32] season the things that are controlling
[1:43:34] the
[1:43:35] people and when they are free then I the
[1:43:40] Lord amen is waiting for them into the
[1:43:46] prophetic tell them what it shall
[1:43:49] be that are to be tell them about the
[1:43:54] Rapture about the New
[1:43:57] Jerusalem in
[1:43:59] season season is that
[1:44:03] amen amen so Galatians
[1:44:07] 5:19 he says the works of the
[1:44:11] flesh amen manifest which are
[1:44:16] these fornication
[1:44:19] uncleanness
[1:44:21] lavious idolatry
[1:44:25] witchcraft hatred Varan
[1:44:31] ulations St sedition heresies EnV MERS
[1:44:40] drunkenness
[1:44:41] reings and such like of which I tell you
[1:44:47] before as I have always told you in the
[1:44:50] time
[1:44:52] p but they which do such
[1:44:55] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:45:00] God together with me you failing the
[1:45:04] now you cannot be the
[1:45:07] prophetic so in
[1:45:11] season of season release them release
[1:45:16] the People by the preaching of the
[1:45:19] word and once they are released
[1:45:24] then tell them about the
[1:45:26] kingdom that they will inherit the
[1:45:29] kingdom of
[1:45:31] God Amen so we Vis the needs of the
[1:45:35] people
[1:45:36] in we put the church in
[1:45:39] order by putting them into life of
[1:45:45] worship you understand what I
[1:45:48] mean you see you you need not be like
[1:45:51] pharaoh
[1:45:53] when Moses went to
[1:45:55] Egypt he told Pharaoh God says that you
[1:46:00] release these people to go and
[1:46:05] worship then Pharaoh
[1:46:08] says it's okay but you can leave the
[1:46:14] children and
[1:46:16] then Moses said
[1:46:19] no everything that sour
[1:46:23] must go with us into the
[1:46:29] worship so
[1:46:31] worship was not something they were
[1:46:33] going to
[1:46:35] do on the mountain of Si
[1:46:40] once but
[1:46:43] worship was
[1:46:47] life that was led by the
[1:46:50] word so when they cross
[1:46:53] over then
[1:46:56] God began to put them into the life of
[1:47:02] worship are you together with me yeah so
[1:47:05] this is what we are dealing with here
[1:47:08] that God be
[1:47:11] gracious that we put the church in
[1:47:14] order to be accepted in the
[1:47:18] worship amen there are certain things we
[1:47:21] break l
[1:47:24] there are certain battles that you go
[1:47:27] through but as we keep
[1:47:30] going one step after
[1:47:32] time we shall come to our
[1:47:37] Victory amen so here we
[1:47:41] are now and in the
[1:47:45] now amen we car the word to perfect the
[1:47:51] Saints we pray
[1:47:54] we baptized we went to the
[1:47:59] [Applause]
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:05] C andate the
[1:48:08] children we establish the people in the
[1:48:12] present but then in the
[1:48:15] prophetic is it
[1:48:18] over when we get out of here no sir
[1:48:23] there is a lot
[1:48:26] more amen what eyes have not
[1:48:31] seen what ears have not had the things
[1:48:35] that God has prepared
[1:48:40] for amen there is a law that God is
[1:48:45] going to un
[1:48:47] for when we break the curtain of
[1:48:51] time amen
[1:48:53] but for now God has allowed me as a
[1:48:57] minister to establish the people in the
[1:49:02] present amen so we teach to make the
[1:49:07] people understand the
[1:49:10] season we the season of the restoration
[1:49:13] of
[1:49:15] all amen but there is still a
[1:49:19] future ahead of us
[1:49:24] if you don't understand
[1:49:26] this it will be
[1:49:29] easy for you to
[1:49:31] drift and go to another
[1:49:34] spot provided it's just a matter of
[1:49:38] worship I'll go to the Catholic
[1:49:43] church because you don't understand the
[1:49:47] now you don't understand what God is
[1:49:50] doing
[1:49:56] are you together with me okay Acts
[1:49:59] chapter
[1:50:01] 3 and verse
[1:50:03] 18 listen to what he
[1:50:05] said but those
[1:50:10] things which God before had showed by
[1:50:14] the mouth of All His
[1:50:19] prophets
[1:50:21] Christ should
[1:50:24] suffer he has
[1:50:26] fulfilled so
[1:50:28] Peter is putting the
[1:50:31] church into
[1:50:35] phases of the
[1:50:37] movement from
[1:50:39] time into
[1:50:42] eternity we are only Jour this
[1:50:46] worship and we are not going back we
[1:50:50] keep gaining ground
[1:50:57] are you together with me
[1:51:01] yes okay Peter says but there are
[1:51:06] certain Old Testament
[1:51:11] prophecies concerning the death and
[1:51:13] resurrection of
[1:51:16] Christ all the way from
[1:51:19] Genesis chapter 3 verse
[1:51:23] 15 up to
[1:51:26] calary then Peter says all those
[1:51:30] things which were
[1:51:32] prophesied are now
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:35] [Applause]
[1:51:37] fulfilled so at the
[1:51:40] time Peter
[1:51:45] commands that as the people waited for
[1:51:49] the oncoming prophetic fulfillment again
[1:52:01] amen praise the lord we need to
[1:52:04] keep in a life of
[1:52:08] repentance and cleaning our
[1:52:11] lives until we break
[1:52:15] again into another
[1:52:18] pH which is
[1:52:21] eternity am amen so God wants to work on
[1:52:25] our
[1:52:26] lives amen he says in verse
[1:52:31] 19
[1:52:34] repent and be
[1:52:37] converted that your
[1:52:40] sins he says all the things which you
[1:52:44] prophesy have been
[1:52:47] for now this is the present
[1:52:52] so far keep a life of
[1:52:57] repentance so that we may step again
[1:53:00] into the next
[1:53:03] phas are you together with me that's how
[1:53:06] we live a Christian
[1:53:08] Life when they were called into season
[1:53:11] of
[1:53:12] worship it was phase after
[1:53:16] phase it was phase after
[1:53:19] phase a prophet would come prophesy them
[1:53:23] into the next
[1:53:25] phase hallelujah hallelujah and they
[1:53:28] needed to step into the next
[1:53:30] phase and then they kept
[1:53:33] going God would rebuke
[1:53:36] them God would correct them God would I
[1:53:40] mean chastise them and they kept
[1:53:44] repenting and God is a good god each
[1:53:48] time they
[1:53:49] repented he put them back from the chest
[1:53:54] and then brought them back again he
[1:53:57] would love them the way he loved them
[1:54:00] and this is the way God is dealing with
[1:54:03] every
[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:09] individual he says repent ye
[1:54:12] therefore and be
[1:54:14] converted that your sins may be brought
[1:54:20] down so that the next
[1:54:24] season may find a clean
[1:54:29] vessel so Peter
[1:54:32] now sends the
[1:54:35] church into the next
[1:54:38] phase and the next
[1:54:40] phase was the time of
[1:54:44] refreshing that would come to the entire
[1:54:49] church from the presence of the Lord
[1:54:53] and the time of
[1:54:56] Peter the time of
[1:54:59] refreshing was prophesying that
[1:55:02] time but now this is our
[1:55:09] now we are in the
[1:55:12] time of
[1:55:16] refreshing
[1:55:18] okay at the time
[1:55:25] the spirit said in
[1:55:28] verse and he shall send Jesus
[1:55:33] Christ after the
[1:55:36] refreshing he sends Jesus
[1:55:39] Christ which
[1:55:42] before was preached
[1:55:46] you are you together with me we are in
[1:55:50] the T of the
[1:55:55] refresh but then he says then
[1:56:00] after he send Jesus
[1:56:04] Christ in
[1:56:06] season out of
[1:56:09] season
[1:56:11] now and
[1:56:13] prophetic are you together with me the
[1:56:16] church has been moving like
[1:56:18] that and that's what Paul
[1:56:22] was telling
[1:56:24] timoth amen so he
[1:56:28] say Heaven Must receive whom the heavens
[1:56:33] must
[1:56:38] receive
[1:56:41] until the times of restitution of all
[1:56:47] things which God has
[1:56:50] spoken by the mouth of is
[1:56:53] prophets since the world
[1:56:57] began so now
[1:56:59] Peter is telling the people of his
[1:57:03] time that we are
[1:57:06] waiting for the time of
[1:57:10] refresh because that was still in the
[1:57:13] future which is our present
[1:57:18] now are you together with me he says but
[1:57:21] when that time
[1:57:23] com there will be a restoration of all
[1:57:29] things and this is where we are now and
[1:57:33] it says after the restoration of all
[1:57:37] things then
[1:57:40] God will send Christ whom the
[1:57:44] heavens would
[1:57:46] hold
[1:57:48] until after all things are restored
[1:57:54] are you together with me so seeing that
[1:57:59] now we in the time of the restitution of
[1:58:02] all
[1:58:04] things our eyes must be open to the
[1:58:08] coming of the
[1:58:11] Lord are you together with me look at
[1:58:14] what is happening in
[1:58:17] isra Israel is our
[1:58:20] calendar Hallelujah It Is
[1:58:27] encompassed by all
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:35] forces it's a type of the
[1:58:40] church are you together with me we are
[1:58:43] getting
[1:58:44] closer for all the
[1:58:48] Fulfillment of the last prophecy

[1:59:17] prophecies that the prophet gave us to
[1:59:21] show us
[1:59:22] the signs of
[1:59:26] time whoever
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:30] knew
[1:59:32] that a
[1:59:34] woman will come and be very
[1:59:39] powerful in
[1:59:43] America brother BR talked about a
[1:59:47] powerful
[1:59:48] woman I don't
[1:59:50] care whether Cala Harris wins the
[1:59:56] election or she doesn't
[1:59:59] win it has come forth that there come a
[2:00:03] powerful
[2:00:05] woman who puts all the men

[2:00:26] everything is just coming down to to
[2:00:29] this
[2:00:30] now I Shar
[2:00:33] out about the Hand of
[2:00:36] Death you see during the Cold
[2:00:43] War when Soviet Union was
[2:00:49] still they were so scared
[2:00:52] that
[2:00:53] America would hit
[2:00:56] them with an atomic
[2:00:59] bomb and so they said
[2:01:02] okay if they do
[2:01:05] that they started going into their
[2:01:10] heads and they developed the Hand of
[2:01:15] Death that even if America beats the
[2:01:18] world Soviet Union
[2:01:24] they developed the Hand of
[2:01:27] Death that just
[2:01:37] senses amen and the moment it
[2:01:43] senses it
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:49] triggers so it doesn't matter
[2:01:58] for
[2:02:00] brother told us that Russia will destroy
[2:02:07] America so it doesn't matter whether
[2:02:09] they come number
[2:02:11] one still the hand of
[2:02:14] death is right
[2:02:18] there you see we are standing at the
[2:02:20] brink of Prophecy

[2:03:16] ignore it and keep looking at the
[2:03:19] present
[2:03:21] can't keep looking at the
[2:03:24] prophecy and ignoring the Pres we have
[2:03:28] to balance the
[2:03:31] thing amen much as one walks on one
[2:03:36] leg 12 B to balance the
[2:03:41] one do you know no man walks on two legs
[2:03:44] you walk on one leg
[2:03:51] we walk by one
[2:03:53] leg you need the other one to balance

[2:04:44] fathers lest they come and smite the
[2:04:46] Earth with a

[2:04:53] but now it's the present
[2:04:57] T this day this scripture is

[2:05:48] now is an anointing
[2:05:52] I've always told you and this anointing
[2:05:55] comes five
[2:06:03] times it began
[2:06:08] with who tored the kingdom of
[2:06:12] Ahab who would bind the
[2:06:16] sky released the
[2:06:18] sky who condemned the 400 prophet into

[2:06:28] passions like
[2:06:34] uses just put him
[2:06:38] a and he says but he

[2:26:05] here what brother Bram says he's the one
[2:26:10] who opened those

[2:26:23] God is
[2:26:25] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[2:26:30] open was the opening of the

[2:27:05] down into the Loos and he says Let There
[2:27:09] be but he was still a
[2:27:12] my and then he started
[2:27:15] revealing in different ways he come
[2:27:19] through the pro
[2:27:21] and the prophets would speak they would
[2:27:24] speak isah would speak but that was
[2:27:28] Christ

[2:29:31] emphasis of our
[2:29:34] ministry of our

[2:29:39] Ministries are not the message of the
[2:29:42] hour we don't make ourselves the
[2:29:47] empasis not even the messenger
[2:29:50] is the message of the
[2:29:53] hour no sir it is the revealing of

[2:30:08] emphasis in the absolute
[2:30:12] message this is a powerful quot

[2:31:26] yellow brown or
[2:31:30] R if he's got a check for
[2:31:33] you for a bank draft for a million
[2:31:38] do you don't care what color he
[2:31:42] was or how he was
[2:31:44] dress the message he has
[2:31:48] for so doesn't
[2:31:51] matter whether brother Bram spoke the
[2:31:58] right oh it was wrong it doesn't matter
[2:32:03] he had the message for
[2:32:06] us hallelujah hallelujah and this
[2:32:09] message is the restoration of all
[2:32:13] things and we need to thank God for we
[2:32:17] are part of the restoration of all
[2:32:21] things it is Christ and him
[2:32:25] revealed that's our
[2:32:27] message amen second
[2:32:31] Timothy
[2:32:33] 42 prach the
[2:32:35] word instant in
[2:32:38] season out of
[2:32:41] season
[2:32:43] rebuke ex with all long
[2:32:47] suffering and
[2:32:50] so let's now break up that
[2:32:53] scripture and then we shall come
[2:32:56] back with a coup
[2:33:03] [Music]
[2:33:11] service are
[2:33:13] welcome with your
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:21] every
[2:33:22] Ministry has a prophetic
[2:33:27] element the Holy
[2:33:29] Spirit may be pointing
[2:33:33] you sometimes to your
[2:33:35] future never consider any
[2:33:39] message that it is
[2:33:48] irrelevant don't say that what they
[2:33:50] preached didn't even touch me every
[2:33:53] Ministry has got an
[2:33:56] element of the
[2:33:58] prophetic then there are these two
[2:34:01] interrelated
[2:34:04] words but theyy in
[2:34:14] degree amen because when he told Timothy
[2:34:20] he told him to preach in
[2:34:24] season out of
[2:34:26] season then he tells him
[2:34:30] reprove
[2:34:32] rebuke those are interrelated
[2:34:38] word and then afterwards he told him to
[2:34:43] ex but with long
[2:34:46] suffering don't be impatient with people
[2:34:53] is now telling a
[2:34:55] minister on how to deal with the
[2:34:59] people so
[2:35:02] in
[2:35:05] chch and now he says to his
[2:35:09] own as many as I
[2:35:13] love I rebuke and
[2:35:17] chust then he says to rebuke
[2:35:21] is to
[2:35:24] reprove those words are almost the
[2:35:28] same to
[2:35:30] rebuke is to
[2:35:32] reprove to repr I mean to prove I mean
[2:35:35] to
[2:35:36] reprove is to
[2:35:39] expose with a
[2:35:44] view
[2:35:46] so to reprove
[2:35:51] is more of teaching a person out of
[2:35:57] error by teaching
[2:36:00] understanding for without a
[2:36:03] vision the people
[2:36:08] perish so when we
[2:36:13] teach we are reproving the
[2:36:17] people to reprove
[2:36:20] is to
[2:36:24] convict with a suggestion of
[2:36:29] Shame of the person
[2:36:34] convicted to you know by
[2:36:39] conviction so that you may bring this
[2:36:41] person to
[2:36:44] life you
[2:36:48] expose you
[2:36:52] by the
[2:36:54] word whether it's
[2:36:57] Error you see what I mean so let's go
[2:37:01] down here and understand this John
[2:37:04] chapter
[2:37:06] 16 and
[2:37:13] verse and when he is
[2:37:18] come the Holy Ghost he will
[2:37:23] reprove the world of
[2:37:26] sin and of
[2:37:29] righteousness and of
[2:37:32] judgment three things are mentioned
[2:37:35] here that the Lord will reprimand the
[2:37:39] world
[2:37:42] for
[2:37:44] righteousness and
[2:37:46] judgment but then when you you read it
[2:37:51] here it's a little bit
[2:37:54] General but then in verse
[2:37:58] 9
[2:37:59] 10
[2:38:01] is kind of separating these
[2:38:07] things
[2:38:10] verse he will reprove the world of
[2:38:16] sin because they believe not in me
[2:38:21] so he rebukes the world of
[2:38:24] sin because they don't
[2:38:27] believe sin is
[2:38:29] unbelief and because you don't
[2:38:32] believe you will commit
[2:38:34] sin sin is the
[2:38:38] nature and sins is what you
[2:38:43] commit
[2:38:44] sins is the fruit of
[2:38:47] unbelief are you together with with me
[2:38:51] then he says of
[2:38:54] righteousness because I go to my
[2:38:56] father and you see me no
[2:39:00] more so this is where our
[2:39:03] rebuke as
[2:39:10] beli rejecting to
[2:39:14] grow into His
[2:39:16] Garment into his righteousness
[2:39:20] that's where you are
[2:39:23] condemned what's with
[2:39:27] you I'm your righteousness I'm your
[2:39:31] righteousness but what's wrong with you
[2:39:34] I'm your
[2:39:37] righteousness who would want to
[2:39:40] say the devil tells
[2:39:45] you and then he says I reprove you
[2:39:50] because you reject what I say of
[2:39:55] you and you accept what the devil says
[2:39:58] about
[2:40:02] you you know what the devil says you are
[2:40:05] not even
[2:40:07] savedes the whis
[2:40:11] that where you come to a point and you
[2:40:15] even
[2:40:16] doubt am I Born Again
[2:40:21] I got so
[2:40:23] [Music]
[2:40:29] angry it's true but he says come under
[2:40:33] the
[2:40:37] blood and the moment you get under the
[2:40:40] blood you are
[2:40:44] righteous but the
[2:40:46] devil sits in the no man's mind I mean
[2:40:49] in the No Man's
[2:40:52] Land that's your
[2:40:54] mind and one of the senses
[2:40:58] there is
[2:41:01] memory you
[2:41:03] remember the cigarette you smoked 30
[2:41:06] years
[2:41:09] ago and he says you
[2:41:12] see and yet God
[2:41:15] says the church will be without spot or
[2:41:28] I think me have
[2:41:29] failed that's what the devil
[2:41:33] does so God reproves
[2:41:37] you for you
[2:41:41] accepting what the devil says about
[2:41:45] you because it paralyzes your growth
[2:41:54] if you accept what God
[2:41:56] says it progresses your
[2:42:00] grow are you together with me the scene
[2:42:05] of the children in the
[2:42:07] supermarket in the
[2:42:10] marketplace they
[2:42:13] piped and these kids did
[2:42:17] Dan then they decided toar
[2:42:22] and these ones didn't
[2:42:24] lament and then that's the kind of the
[2:42:28] church the believer is reminded of
[2:42:32] him that we have a high priest
[2:42:36] of the slain
[2:42:40] lamp at the mer seat the blood is
[2:42:44] offered for your
[2:42:47] condition and therefore by
[2:42:49] Faith accept your
[2:42:52] righteousness do you accept your
[2:42:54] righteousness this
[2:42:56] morning
[2:42:57] amen yeah Romans
[2:43:01] 51 amen let's be
[2:43:04] patient I preached two Services
[2:43:08] yesterday amen and I came back very
[2:43:11] tired I was not through with
[2:43:15] this and I was not through with even the
[2:43:18] evening Serv
[2:43:21] so I slept about
[2:43:25] 2:00 and apart from
[2:43:29] Brother no man has got more hair than
[2:43:35] me so if I can be
[2:43:39] patient let us be patient
[2:43:42] together amen he says in Romans
[2:43:47] 51 therefore
[2:43:49] being justified by
[2:43:53] [Applause]
[2:44:03] [Music]
[2:44:06] faith
[2:44:08] because you
[2:44:11] know is p
[2:44:14] test and if there is a problem today
[2:44:20] then there is no
[2:44:23] remedy but
[2:44:26] Paul is saying therefore being justified
[2:44:31] by
[2:44:35] faith we have peace with
[2:44:38] God through our Lord Jesus
[2:44:41] Christ no need for self
[2:44:46] condemnation we are being justified
[2:44:51] present continu
[2:44:54] sacrifice amen so just submit
[2:44:58] your so now you know you just go and
[2:45:04] present
[2:45:05] yourself and say father
[2:45:09] have you wake up in the
[2:45:12] morning and the devil is standing at the
[2:45:15] door he's ready to knock you down
[2:45:20] temper
[2:45:21] anger malice certain things that you can
[2:45:25] never
[2:45:27] forgive you know he's always there but
[2:45:31] each time you open your
[2:45:33] door and he's right there look at the
[2:45:37] cross the
[2:45:39] sacrifice is still bleeding for
[2:45:42] you amen so but
[2:45:46] then we are rebuked
[2:45:52] amen uh I don't know how I can bring
[2:45:56] this out
[2:45:57] but let us get back to that scripture of
[2:46:01] chapter 6 I mean 16 verse
[2:46:05] 8 and when he is
[2:46:08] come he will reprove the world of
[2:46:12] sin and of Jud I mean and of
[2:46:16] righteousness and no of
[2:46:20] judgment amen so we have a rebuke
[2:46:27] also which is dealing more with
[2:46:32] iniquity so
[2:46:35] rebuking is to a
[2:46:38] person that tends to insist in
[2:46:44] error
[2:46:47] reprove and then
[2:46:50] to
[2:46:51] reprove you are
[2:46:53] correcting but
[2:46:56] rebuke is dealing with more of a
[2:47:01] person that doesn't want to get out of
[2:47:04] the
[2:47:07] condition amen so
[2:47:12] Church brother Bram says and now he says
[2:47:16] to his own
[2:47:19] as many as
[2:47:21] I I rebuke
[2:47:24] and to rebuke is to
[2:47:28] reprove to reprove is to expose with the
[2:47:32] view of
[2:47:37] Correction does not mean to
[2:47:40] punish it means to
[2:47:44] disit because the subject amendment is
[2:47:47] in mind
[2:47:54] are you together with me so when you
[2:47:58] punish you know there is
[2:48:02] pain of
[2:48:04] judgment
[2:48:06] amen that's a
[2:48:09] punishment it
[2:48:11] is
[2:48:16] Judgment so go
[2:48:20] God does not condemn his
[2:48:23] [Music]
[2:48:27] seed there is therefore no
[2:48:34] condemnation but when you error and
[2:48:42] you and the purpose is not to give you
[2:48:46] pain the purpose is
[2:48:52] reconcil they are very delicate
[2:48:57] words amen so let's just fall back in
[2:49:02] second Timothy
[2:49:04] again and re look at them very well
[2:49:08] preach the
[2:49:09] word in
[2:49:11] season out of season reprove rebuke
[2:49:17] exalt
[2:49:18] all longsuffering
[2:49:20] and so the
[2:49:23] instruction is laid
[2:49:25] out amen when you
[2:49:29] reprove you are
[2:49:31] teaching you rebuke you try to come
[2:49:36] down in a little bit of a higher
[2:49:41] level deal with a
[2:49:44] person who does not want to restore
[2:49:47] himself
[2:49:50] and now after that is
[2:49:52] done he also says
[2:49:57] exalt Amen to exalt is to
[2:50:03] uplift you don't rebuke a
[2:50:07] person and you shut him away from
[2:50:10] you he says that's not the way
[2:50:14] work you rebuke a person open the door
[2:50:19] ex
[2:50:19] [Music]
[2:50:21] him it is possible to
[2:50:24] overcome those things many people have
[2:50:28] suffered it is possible that your family
[2:50:33] can be
[2:50:34] reconciled so as you have come back
[2:50:37] together you begin to exalt that's the
[2:50:41] way God
[2:50:44] works to work Sal is to comfort by

[2:53:30] Workman that when you get the
[2:53:33] word doesn't throw you out of the
[2:53:37] world are you together with me a man

[2:53:53] of season but Christ must
[2:53:57] remain of
[2:54:01] our amen never preach away from
[2:54:07] Christ many people take certain
[2:54:11] things and they become thetick
[2:54:18] who a Believer
[2:54:21] is if you are a Believer you would be
[2:54:27] shouting and you are teaching the people
[2:54:31] away Christ is the central identity of
[2:54:36] the
[2:54:38] believer in each age he kept introducing
[2:54:44] himself to the people with the life
[2:54:47] relevant that
[2:54:50] age it was always
[2:54:52] Christ it was Christ in the Ephesian
[2:54:56] AG when he was holding Seven Stars in
[2:54:58] his right
[2:55:00] hand walking am the seven golden
[2:55:06] candlesticks he alone was the absolute
[2:55:11] Authority amen Behind The
[2:55:14] Messengers behind all the ministers
[2:55:18] the entire
[2:55:19] church all the way from
[2:55:22] Ephesus
[2:55:24] toia and all those
[2:55:26] SP and they spoke to their
[2:55:29] age Hallelujah hallu but all together
[2:55:34] they came up under the one voice the
[2:55:38] voice of Christ to the seven Church
[2:55:41] ages are you together with me amen so I
[2:55:46] want to say now
[2:55:48] we are in the last Church
[2:55:50] age and now to the last Church
[2:55:54] age all the
[2:55:56] voices of the seven
[2:55:59] Messengers are
[2:56:02] heard through the messenger of
[2:56:06] Malachi amen is the sering up
[2:56:12] voice the voice of Malachi
[2:56:15] 4 this message here
[2:56:19] is the voice of
[2:56:21] Christ is the voice of many
[2:56:24] Waters whatever voice
[2:56:27] speaks it must speak through this
[2:56:31] words we must say what the messenger
[2:56:36] say because what the messenger
[2:56:39] say is the
[2:56:41] Capstone of the spirit of Christ through
[2:56:44] the seven Church
[2:56:46] ages hallelujah hallelujah so he's
[2:56:48] finishing up here now and let us finish
[2:56:52] with him in Revelation
[2:56:55] 3:14 to the end of the Church of the
[2:56:58] Lans
[2:57:01] right this thing says the
[2:57:05] amen the faithful and true
[2:57:09] witness the beginning of the creation of
[2:57:12] God so by handling the
[2:57:16] word in season
[2:57:19] we are identifying with
[2:57:22] him amen because our season here is the
[2:57:27] season of the
[2:57:29] amen hallelujah hallelujah you cannot
[2:57:32] preach the people
[2:57:35] father because the next thing is to
[2:57:39] release
[2:57:41] Christ the Heavens to release him so we
[2:57:45] preach to prepare the people
[2:57:48] for the second coming of
[2:57:50] Christ that's our
[2:57:53] Focus amen so now we must identify him
[2:57:59] as the faithful and true
[2:58:01] witness the beginning of the creation of
[2:58:05] God these are the areas where God wants
[2:58:09] us to identify ourselves
[2:58:16] [Music]
[2:58:19] we can't preach the people
[2:58:22] further we can't bring an e
[2:58:25] messenger he has no
[2:58:29] place they know how to hide in some of
[2:58:33] those
[2:58:36] areas but there's no
[2:58:39] place Jesus is giving this description
[2:58:43] of
[2:58:45] himself is giving this Des deson of
[2:58:48] himself a
[2:58:50] quot in relation to the last
[2:58:55] age are you in the last age
[2:58:57] church so see how Christ is identifying
[2:59:01] himself in the
[2:59:05] now he says the days of grace are
[2:59:08] winding
[2:59:10] up he looks back from the first
[2:59:14] century right through the 20th
[2:59:18] and told us all things concerning these
[2:59:23] ages before he
[2:59:26] reveals the characteristics of the last
[2:59:29] age to
[2:59:31] us he gives us one final
[2:59:35] look at his own gracious and supreme
[2:59:42] Dy this is the Capstone revelation of
[2:59:46] himself
[2:59:49] that
[2:59:50] says the
[2:59:55] [Music]
[2:59:57] amen is
[3:00:00] all people say that Jesus is enough
[3:00:03] Hallelujah
[3:00:05] Hallelujah Jesus is
[3:00:09] what we in the cstone of everything
[3:00:18] then he says Jesus is the man of
[3:00:22] God Jesus is the soul Let It Be of
[3:00:26] God Amen stands for
[3:00:30] finality it stands for
[3:00:34] approval it stands for prevailing
[3:00:38] promise it stands for unchanging
[3:00:44] promise it stands for the Seal of
[3:00:50] this is where we are I've walked all the
[3:00:53] seven
[3:00:55] churches Jesus will be heard
[3:00:58] saying and now I am in the whining of
[3:01:01] the days of
[3:01:03] grace the days where
[3:01:06] men are standing between Time and
[3:01:10] Eternity I am the
[3:01:12] Amen in this age we are in the amen age
[3:01:18] the age which seales
[3:01:21] everything the age of
[3:01:23] adoption in this age is here to
[3:01:27] vindicate
[3:01:28] himself as
[3:01:30] [Music]
[3:01:32] faithful as
[3:01:36] faithful are you together with me when
[3:01:39] you opened the seven
[3:01:43] seal the
[3:01:45] seventh the angel came down
[3:01:51] let me read
[3:01:53] that to prove his the amen give me
[3:01:57] Revelation 8
[3:01:58] verse1 because he's
[3:02:02] faithful he's
[3:02:04] amen he's in the time where he meets all
[3:02:10] needs of his
[3:02:12] people he
[3:02:14] knows that we are weak
[3:02:18] but
[3:02:19] then listen to me but then we can
[3:02:25] pray and when he had opened seven
[3:02:29] SE there was silence in heaven about the
[3:02:32] space of
[3:02:36] hour what was the silence
[3:02:39] for the person
[3:02:42] himself had come down to reveal
[3:02:46] himself and prep his
[3:02:49] Bri go to verse two
[3:02:52] there and I saw the seven
[3:02:56] angels which stood before
[3:02:59] God and them were given seven
[3:03:03] trumpets
[3:03:05] verse and another
[3:03:10] Ang hallelujah hallelujah The
[3:03:14] Messengers seven trumpet angels
[3:03:19] and another
[3:03:23] angel that was seen in Revelation
[3:03:27] 10 this time he referred to as another
[3:03:33] Angel he now comes at the
[3:03:36] altar because the
[3:03:42] one who who answers the prayer of people
[3:03:48] his he the
[3:03:50] amen he has come down at the altar
[3:03:55] having a god
[3:03:57] s there was given unto
[3:04:01] him that he should offer it with the
[3:04:05] prayers of all the saints upon the
[3:04:08] golden altar which was Before the Throne
[3:04:12] he's here to receive your
[3:04:15] prayers I am amen we are living in the
[3:04:20] edge where all things are
[3:04:26] possible the problem we fail to
[3:04:30] understand the
[3:04:31] season we've got chronic problems we've
[3:04:35] got chronic
[3:04:36] conditions but God be
[3:04:39] gracious that we may
[3:04:41] recognize we in the age of the
[3:04:45] amen where are all things are
[3:04:50] possible he never you know he he never
[3:04:54] said by my
[3:04:56] strip you are healed and he fails on the
[3:05:02] promise because
[3:05:04] amen means a prevailing
[3:05:08] promise and he's
[3:05:10] faithful that's how is introducing
[3:05:12] himself in this
[3:05:14] age is the age of the faithful
[3:05:19] amen he has promised the Rapture for his
[3:05:24] body he will not fail he promised that
[3:05:28] he will be perfect he will not fail this
[3:05:32] is the Now
[3:05:34] message hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[3:05:39] Amen this is a long
[3:05:41] quot but I'll read it for
[3:05:44] you these things says the faithful and
[3:05:48] true
[3:05:52] witness
[3:05:54] faithful and
[3:05:56] true two
[3:05:58] things some people will give
[3:06:01] promises they'll fail on
[3:06:04] them but this one is faithful and
[3:06:10] true is there anything you have need of
[3:06:14] today he's faithful and true
[3:06:18] he never fails he can create
[3:06:22] opportunities amen I said that one
[3:06:25] time and the ziman who was seated back
[3:06:30] there he said pastor I'm going to create
[3:06:34] a job the next week he got a job and he
[3:06:39] ran
[3:06:44] away are you together with me yes see
[3:06:48] they know the
[3:06:50] principles they are
[3:06:53] Pentecostals they understand and they
[3:06:55] catch those things by
[3:06:58] faith but some of these people in the
[3:07:08] message they just say that is
[3:07:11] right but the ziman in the
[3:07:15] corner mixed it with faith
[3:07:18] and walk out with your
[3:07:23] blessing so we are in the
[3:07:26] time of the third
[3:07:30] po are you together with me the time of
[3:07:35] the power of the spoken
[3:07:39] word in the presence of
[3:07:42] theen and is willing to receive the
[3:07:45] prayers
[3:07:48] who will pray
[3:07:51] today let's identify the
[3:07:56] now what we are dealing
[3:07:58] with we are
[3:08:00] dealing with the
[3:08:02] revelation of Christ in the now who
[3:08:07] never fails in
[3:08:11] anything amen amen these things says the
[3:08:16] faithful and true Witness
[3:08:20] now I want to show
[3:08:21] you what I found in the thought of
[3:08:27] faithful you know we often talk about
[3:08:30] great and changing
[3:08:33] God whose word does not
[3:08:36] change and when we speak of him after
[3:08:41] the
[3:08:41] manner we often get a
[3:08:44] view of him that makes seem
[3:08:47] very imp
[3:08:51] personal it is as though God made the
[3:08:55] world
[3:08:56] universe and the laws that pertain to
[3:09:01] it and then stood
[3:09:04] back and became a great
[3:09:11] impal it's like they've done these
[3:09:14] cars which brother Bram saw in the
[3:09:17] vision
[3:09:19] which don't have a
[3:09:20] driver you just
[3:09:24] program then you can sleep
[3:09:27] forever and then it will tell you you
[3:09:30] have
[3:09:32] arrived that's not the God we
[3:09:35] Ser
[3:09:37] amen God
[3:09:40] cares it is as though God made a way of
[3:09:44] salvation for lost mankind
[3:09:49] that way being the
[3:09:51] cross but and when and
[3:09:54] then when the death of Christ has atoned
[3:09:58] for our
[3:10:00] sins and his resurrection gave us an
[3:10:03] open door to
[3:10:07] him God folded back his arms and stood
[3:10:13] back this is how they believe it in the
[3:10:15] message
[3:10:18] that God made of
[3:10:21] Salvation sent his son he died on the
[3:10:24] cross whoever believes him goes to
[3:10:28] heaven and he goes
[3:10:30] there that's how people
[3:10:32] think no God is concerned for your daily
[3:10:40] activities he's the god of
[3:10:43] now he cares in your ca he cares in your
[3:10:48] job he cares in your school he cares
[3:10:52] what you eat he cares how you
[3:10:55] eat that's the god of
[3:10:59] [Applause]
[3:10:59] [Music]
[3:11:01] now are you together with me he cares
[3:11:04] when you get in your car he cares when
[3:11:08] you enter your house he cares when you
[3:11:11] walk on the street God cares that's the
[3:11:15] god I want us to believe
[3:11:21] is a God who cares for a young
[3:11:26] mother who is raising up the
[3:11:29] children because the scripture says she
[3:11:32] shall be saved by
[3:11:39] childbearing she shall be saved by child
[3:11:42] bear
[3:11:48] praise the Lord it as if we measured in
[3:11:52] believing a great
[3:11:55] Creator who have been created most
[3:11:58] personal interest in his
[3:12:01] creation Now I say that is how too many
[3:12:08] people think but that's what thinking
[3:12:13] for God is
[3:12:15] governing in their faith of men
[3:12:20] now he's both Creator and
[3:12:25] sustainer he's
[3:12:28] caring in your entire
[3:12:30] life he cares about your
[3:12:34] breakfast come on I'm telling you
[3:12:36] something he cares about your
[3:12:40] supper are you together with me learn to
[3:12:43] tell him he came down here to make it
[3:12:48] easy for his
[3:12:51] bride but too much has been preached
[3:12:54] into
[3:12:55] mind that after he made away he his
[3:13:00] hands he's waiting for you to overcome
[3:13:04] and he takes you home no sir now God
[3:13:10] cares now and the
[3:13:14] prophetic in the now
[3:13:18] cares he cares because you have got
[3:13:21] children he cares when they go school he
[3:13:25] cares when you cry for a job God
[3:13:29] cares that's the God you must worship
[3:13:33] he's not an idol he not a dead
[3:13:36] Idol amen he not a computer
[3:13:41] programming like that car no sir God
[3:13:46] cares
[3:13:48] cares for your children cares for your
[3:13:50] mother cares for your father cares when
[3:13:54] you cry car when you are happy that's
[3:13:58] the God
[3:14:00] now amen he says here by reading
[3:14:03] Colossians
[3:14:05] 1:16 for by him were all things
[3:14:09] created that are in heaven and that in
[3:14:12] the earth visible and invisible whether
[3:14:15] they be throned
[3:14:17] all dominions all principalities all
[3:14:21] powers all things were created by
[3:14:24] Him and for him and he's before all
[3:14:29] things and by him all things
[3:14:32] consist he's a sovereign
[3:14:35] God by his own

[3:17:51] matters amen they are
[3:17:54] matters they were also
[3:17:58] Witnesses Jesus was a faithful
[3:18:03] matter the Holy Ghost is the witness to
[3:18:07] that the spirit Bears record to
[3:18:11] that the world hated
[3:18:14] Jesus it killed him but God loved him
[3:18:19] and he went to the Father the proof that
[3:18:22] he went to the father is that the Holy
[3:18:26] Ghost
[3:18:27] came if Jesus had not been
[3:18:31] received of the father Spirit would have
[3:18:35] not
[3:18:35] come amen he reads here John
