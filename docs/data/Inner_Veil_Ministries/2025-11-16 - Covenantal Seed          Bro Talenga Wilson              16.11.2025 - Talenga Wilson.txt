Let us pray. Loving precious father, &gt;&gt; it is such a good morning. that you've bestowed unto us, Father, to come to your presence and to have fellowship with one another and also have fellowship with you. We are so grateful this morning. Lord, you have permitted us once again to be back in the house of God. Lord God, you spoke in thy word that where two or three shall gather in my name, I will always be in their midst. And precious father, we invite you this morning that you may come and be in our midst and have total preeminence of the services. We commit everyone of us We commit Lord the services of the Lord. We also commit the needs of the people. Come Lord. Father we pray that you that searches the hearts that Lord may search through their lives. We attend to everyone's need according to your riches in glory. Precious father we commit Lord even the teaching of thy word. Precious Lord you may come and take a total preeminence. May you take this your word Lord God and father. May you speak into our hearts. May you circumcise the lips of the speakers that Lord they may only speak thy minds and may also circumcise Lord the ears of the audience that Lord may receive your word this morning as you have prepared for each one of us. Bless us all together. Lord, we bless our pastors wherever they are, oh God. We bless Pastor James. We bless Pastoral and their entire families, Lord, that you may bless them, oh God, with good health, with protection and anointing, Lord, that they may continue, Lord, of glory, in the ministry of your word. Father Lord Jesus come and take I commit myself to you Lord just as a person not worthy fil with filthy garments God when you come down father that I may hide behind thee oh God I know I'll be able to speak Lord the patches of blood permit it oh God in the most precious name Jesus Christ I pray &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our pastors are not around. They have barriers. Pastor James, the sister lost a husband &gt;&gt; and that sister is also a sister to pastor Eal's wife. So the two families are not with us today. They are going to be part of the barrier today. So we keep them in prayer. Amen. So I was permitted and asked by the pastor to stand in the gap today. That's why I was not able to preach in the Sunday school. Amen. Will you allow me to speak to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not me that will be speaking. I believe it's the grace and the spirit of God that will be speaking to us this morning. Amen. And I have just yielded myself as a vessel to be used by God to speak to each of our minds to speak to each of our hearts. Amen. So now without wasting a lot of time, I'll invite you to the reading of the word in the book of Romans chapter 9 verse 8. Amen. Amen. The scripture says &gt;&gt; that is that is they which are the children of the flesh. These are not the children of God. But the children of the promise are counted for the seed. For this is the word of promise. At this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election may stand not of works but of him that calleth. Amen. Amen. Amen. That the purpose of God according to election may stand not of works but of him that calleth. Praise the Lord. less than Ephesians 1 verse one to verse 6. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all the spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Amen. having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved according as he has chosen us. In him before the foundation of the world, a covenantal seed elected by for knowledge. Praise the Lord. May the Lord add a bless be seated. Amen. Amen. So for this morning I want to be sharing on a convened by fornowledge. So now here in Romans, the scripture speaks about Isaac and and and his father Abraham and speaks about the word of promise which God had given to Abraham that he would have a son. And the scripture says this is the word of promise. It was God speaking. At this time I will come. And when he said I will come, he said and Sarah shall have a son. That was a promise. Praise the Lord. And now according to Sarah. She couldn't see where the sun was coming from. According to Abraham, he couldn't see the sun. Praise the Lord. But yet according to God, the son had already existed. And so God told Abraham that it has to be your son. There shall be hair over your property because God had rather seen the existence of the son even when the son was not yet in manifestation. And then he said, "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election may stand." Praise the Lord, not of works, but of him that. And then he comes here in Ephesians and says, "Grace be to you and peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ." And then he says in verse four, according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. So now we see where we are here. We see ourselves that we were chosen in Christ before even the world was laid by calling us. He has chosen us in him. Before the foundation of the world, we should be holy without blame. Before him, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children, But Jesus took himself upon the good pleasure of his will. So now we see here in the scripture that God shows us by for knowledge. He chose us in him even before laying the foundation of the world that we should be holy. Praise the Lord. So he sought about us and our holiness even before the world was late. And then he says then he chose us in him to live a holy life. Praise the Lord to the glory of him that will praise the Lord. Let's listen close here. The choice of God. I want to liken you today the natural birth. Praise the Lord. You see each time the prophet preached, he picked out a natural to type the spiritual because it is the natural man. What is the spiritual realm? So now the choice of God must liken it to the natural birth. Every man, every young man, praise the Lord, right from their infants, they have a seat or they have seats of their children whom they would bear when they grow up. Praise the Lord. Every little baby, every little boy that you see, he has his children with him. Praise the Lord. So as he is growing, in him are the seeds of his children. In him are his children, but yet they are not yet into manifestation. But the reality of it is that he has his children in me. Praise the Lord. We see brother Cyrus here. He's not yet married. He has no children. But in him are his children. Praise the Lord. He is carrying his children with him in form of his seat. Praise the Lord. But yet his children are not yet manifested. Praise the Lord. But now when the brother grows up and he has reached his stage of maturity, and he feels he wants to have a family, he will go get a woman and make her his wife and then they will begin to bear children. But before that, the brother cannot call his children. Praise the Lord. He even doesn't know the picture. He has doesn't know how his children shall look like. Praise the Lord. And yet he is very sure that in him are his children. That's why he makes a choice and says, "I want to marry because now I want to have children." Praise the Lord. Now he has faith that he has the seed. He has faith that he can bear children. Praise the Lord. And now because of that choice, he makes to go and have children by way of marriage. Praise the Lord. He is very confident that he shall bear children. But as long as he's still single, he can say he has children, but yet he has them, but they are not yet in manifestation. Until they into manifestation, That's when the brother will call his children by name. Praise the Lord. And that's exactly how we were. The Bible says according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. So now in Christ, before the foundation of the world, we existed in him as a seat. against God. We existed in him as children although we were not yet into manifestation. Praise the Lord. And now when Silas bears his children, praise the Lord, he now begins to name them. Now he identifies them. He says this woman shall be called Joseph. Praise the Lord. Because Joseph has now come from his loins. Praise the Lord. And now Joseph is into manifestation. And when he looks at Joseph, he shall say, "This is my son Joseph." Because Joseph has been brought into manifestation. Praise the Lord. So now when God came to Sarah and Abraham, he told them, "You will bear children." Why? Because God had already made those children. Before even Sarah had met Abraham, before even Sarah and Abraham were made, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. And he saw them because he created them before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. And so when we are born, we don't have a choice of who we shall be born to. We have no choice. We select our fathers. Praise the Lord. We have no choice. We select our children. Praise the Lord. But yet our children don't have also a choice of who their father will be by default that they are our children. My children are my children by predestination. God prepared that I will have children. Praise the Lord. So when the time came and I produce children, they have no choice who their father should be because in the first place they were born in me. Praise the Lord. God created me and he created me along them when they come manifestation. Praise the Lord. They only coming to manifest that which was a part of me. Praise the Lord. So the same way the scripture says according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. That means before the foundation of the world thought about you thought about me and then he chose us. Praise the Lord that our existence already existed in him before the foundation of the world. So now when we are born into the world, we are simply manifesting that which existed in Christ before the foundation of the world. Praise the living God. So now you are who you are today because God chose you before the foundation of the world. So now he has brought you here simply as a manifestation of that which was part of him before he laid the foundations of the world. And then he said he has chosen us to be holy. Praise the Lord. He has chosen you to be holy. He has given you the grace to be holy. Not because he has a choice now, but because you were meant to be holy. Because you were from God. If you are from God, you must be holy. That's why he has chosen you to be holy. Praise the Lord. So your holiness is simply picking up from your your seat. which is in God according as he has chosen us in him in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. You are here today because God knew you. You are here today because God chose you. Praise the Lord. You didn't choose to be here. You didn't choose to believe what you believe. You believe what you believe because you are recognizing your position that you were in him who is holy. So when he speaks his word and you are able to recognize it that means is the deep that is responding to the deep. It is his word that you came from that speaks to you and you are able to hear. When you hear you are able to recognize that this is speaking about you how you believe. Praise the Lord. You are not believing today. You are not coming to God today. You were already in him before you were even born. Praise the Lord. So now when time comes and he begins to speak, when time comes and begins to search for you, Jesus said, I came to seek and save them that were lost. Lost from where? Because they are part of him. They are part of God. And now when you born to the world, they somehow got lost. But God is very faithful. They even have thought about how he would save us. Praise the Lord. By for knowledge he saw us into existence. Even before we were even before the world was laid. And by poor knowledge he saw how we would be perverted. Before we were even here and by knowledge he thought about a plan how he would reconcile us back to him. And so he brought the lamb of God. Behold the lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world. For he slew his lamb. &gt;&gt; He slew the lamb in his mind. Praise the Lord. He slew the lamb Jesus Christ. So he would die and then he would bring the blood to atone for our sin, to atone for our mistakes. This is a plan that God had even before he laid the foundation. Praise the Lord. So when we were born, we were already born when the plan had been laid. The plan to save you didn't come when you had the gospel. The plan to save you was written before the foundation. Jesus is existing. He did not exist at the time when he was born by Mary. He existed in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. God knew the devil would pervert us from the lineage of God. Satan will try to take us off the stripes and he thought about you and says this Silus, this Wilson, this S is mine and he has to be mine and nobody will be able to take him away from you. And so he laid a plan. I said, I know when he's born, he'll be born with amnesia. Praise the Lord because he will be born in sin. But then I must lay a plan. But how I will reconcile him to say behold the lamb. So he killed the lamb to die for us before the foundation of the world. So when Jesus came, he was only fulfilling that he was bringing to manifestation the plan that God had before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. And I once said this, brother. We did not believe. We simply recognized the voice that spoke to us. And that voice was speaking directly to our hearts. Because in our spirit is the seed of God. In your spirit, your spirit is the seed of God because your spirit came from God. As long as you have the spirit of God in you, you will somehow hear the voice and recognize that this voice is speaking to you. That's when you shall say, I believe. Praise the Lord. There is no you are able to believe. that seed is not in you. The son of man came to seek and save them that were lost. They were lost because they are part of Jesus. They are part of him. Praise the Lord. So you are simply recognized that he speaks to you. So you know a metal &gt;&gt; and a wood when you bring a magnet &gt;&gt; and you put here a pieces of wood you put here pieces of metal pure metal the magnet &gt;&gt; will only look for a a nature that resembles his praise the Lord much as the woods may want to be attracted but because they not the nature of a magnet. They cannot be attracted to it because the magnet will not be able to seek it will not be able to recognize it. Praise the Lord. But the pieces of metal as they are being covered in swelise the Lord. When you place the magnet there, they will be able to organize the force. Praise the Lord. And somehow they make their way towards the magnet because the nature of the magnet has been organized by the nature that is in the metal. That's how we are born, brothers. Praise the Lord. When we are born, we have the seed of God in us. Praise the Lord. So when we hear the voice, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We are men in those groups. We were many in the groups, many in the communities and we all heard this voice. It only took the life of God to recognize that voice. You know that oh there is a voice that is calling you and then you accepted the voice and you began to make your way towards the voice. We came to seek those that were lost. We had been lost and covered. We mentioned the teachings of the world. But when he brought his word, that word had to be recognized by the life that is in us. Praise the Lord. As I once said his brothers, Jesus said, "No man can come to me, except the father has drawn himself, there's no man that can come to me, except the father and he goes ahead to say there is no you can come to the father except you are known of him." Praise the Lord. So now when Jesus speaks, he's speaking to those that were a part of him as covenantal seed, a seed of promise that was elected before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. Now, no matter how far you could have gone, anyhow, when you hear the voice, when you hear the words, praise the Lord, you will make your way out. Praise the Lord. And remember, when these small metals are coming towards the magnet, they don't come by their force. It is the force of the magnet that pulls them towards when you come to Christ. It's not by your effort. It is God that gives you the grace to march towards him. Praise the Lord because you were a part of him. Praise the Lord. That's how we can look at ourselves that we are who we are because we are part of him. And if if you are part of him, Jesus said that there is no way you will ever get lost. Praise the Lord. Because when you came to him, it was not in your personal effort. But he gave you the grace. Praise the Lord. Much as his seat was there, he still gave you the grace to move towards. Praise the Lord. You have not chosen me. I have chosen you. Praise the Lord. So now he has chosen us to come here on earth that we may begin to manifest his attributes. Praise the Lord. My children, Sam's children, when they look at Sam's child, they will not say this is Wilson's child. No sir, because Sam's child has the attributes of his father son. Praise the Lord. The way he looks, the way he walks, it is all depicting some. So you can't say this is Wilson's child. No sir. Even if you told him that Gabriel, &gt;&gt; your father is Wilson. You say no, my papa is Sam. Because by nature, Sam and Gabriel are connected. There is no way you can break that bone. nature by for knowledge the sons of God are connected to God. Praise the Lord. There is nothing that can wreck that relationship. There is nothing that can wreak that bond. Why? Because we were in him before the foundation of the world. So when we come here, the way the children manifest the attributes of their parents is the same way the sons and daughters of God are able to manifest the attributes of their fathers. Praise the Lord. And the prophet says in the message the invisal union of the bride preach 1965 paragraph 59 says and a son is the attributes of his father. And just as you were in the genes of your father, in the body of your father when he was a young boy, you were in him. Yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you. But then through the bing grounds of a mother, you were brought forth into the earth and became in the image of your father. Then he could have fellowship with you. So were you sons of God and daughters of God before there were even was a moon. Friends, I want us to perceive this clear. I want us to see our positions in Christ. I want us to see our position that we existed in him before even the stars and the moons were created. So you are not here this afternoon by mistake. You are here because God predestinated you to be here. You are here because you are his son. You are his daughter. You are here because he knew you before you even existed. Praise the Lord. So you are able to overcome not because you have the ability but because the nature in you is the nature of victory. Because Christ overcame and he overcame for who? He ever came for you and me. &gt;&gt; So the nature that we have because he says according he has chosen us in him. So if he has chosen us in him and we are his children that means we have his nature. The nature of God is the nature of victory. Praise the Lord. And he says praise the Lord. And he says, "But then through the bedding grounds of a mother, you were brought forth into the earth and became in the image of your father. Then he could have fellowship with you. So you were sons and daughters of God before there were even a moon, stars, or a molecule. You were sons and daughters of God. For you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God. At the beginning, remember how God created man. Praise the Lord. He had created everything in the earth. Praise the Lord. But then I had created everything. He said, "But now I have created everything. &gt;&gt; But nothing have I am I able to have fellowship with. And how did God create? He created by the spoken word. Praise the Lord. He spoke things into existence." The brothers preached last Sunday that he was expressing his thought. He had a thought. Praise the Lord. And now some of us have been to school and now we studied uh fine art. Praise the Lord. So the teacher could come and tell you you are going to draw a port and that port should have these attributes. So now the only way you are able to draw this pot is when you have the pot in your mind. So you you begin to have the picture of the pot in your mind and how this port is going to look like. Praise the Lord. So that when you get a pencil and a paper, you begin to depict to display that which is in your mind. Every artist Praise the Lord. When they begin to put their pens on a paper, they are simply making a point a painting of that which is in their mind. They are expressing their soul. So God had his thoughts and those thoughts were already. Praise the Lord. They were typing who God is. Praise the Lord. Because when you hear me speaking, I am speaking myself. So if I am speaking myself, you say it is Wilson speaking. Because my voice cannot be separated from the person of me. Praise the Lord. When you hear my voice, you know it is me that is speaking. When you hear the brother, you know it is him that is speaking. So when he's speaking, he's speaking that which is which is in his throat. expressing his thoughts. So now in the beginning when God was creating, he created everything by the spoken word. Where did the spoken word come from? It had to come from God because it was a part of God. It was the thought of God being expressed. Praise the Lord. And when he spoke, whatever he spoke came into existence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now when the Bible says we were in Christ, we were in him. That means we were a part of his thought. Praise the Lord. So time had to come and God wanted to have God wanted to have fellowship with the people with the children which he had thought of. When my time came I needed to have fellowship. I wanted to have a family so now I could get a wife and produce children and produce children. So the children that were in me are now no longer in me. They are now into the world being manifested as objects came from me. So I am able to look at them and have fellowship with them. That was my desire. That was the desire of God. And God said let us create man in our own image. So he created man and then he went ahead. Praise the Lord. When he got the ground to create this man to create this body which is governed by the five senses. Praise the Lord. Then he went ahead and he picked a part of him that was in him and he got mad and the Bible says and he breathed in his nostrils. So now God was speaking part of his own life and putting it into man. And the Bible says it was until that time that man became a living soul. When he had created him, he was simply an object until God picked a part of him and raised in this man. Then this man became a living soul. That means something had to come from God to bring life to man. That is the seed that God put in man. And that seed shall never get lost. That seed can never get lost. Because where does that seed live? It does not live in the on the in the body because this body is governed by the five senses. Praise the Lord. And then we have the soul inside of this body and it's also governed by senses of emotion. Praise the Lord. You have sensations in your soul. You are moved by emotions. You feel angry. Much as the body is not showing but you can get upset. Praise the Lord. But yet in that soul is the spirit and that spirit is the seed of God that came from God. So when God is coming, he speaks to your spirit because it is your spirit that identifies with him. That's why he says we are a part of him not this body because this body will rot and die but that spirit cannot die. Why? Because it is eternal. It is a seed of God and it is a seed of God and God is eternal. That seed can never die. That's why Jesus said, "I will raise them up to the last day." Why? Because that seed is totally eternal. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's who we are. That's who you are. You are the seed of God because in you is the spirit of God. The spirit of God is. Praise the Lord. That is a blessing. According he has chosen us. In him before the foundation of the world and says, "Therefore, as sure as your gene heart be in your father before your natural birth, your spiritual gene had be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts. before the foundation of the world. Right? No way around it. That is right. Now we notice together then that that life being in you. God is life being in you from the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. So when we come to this body, we are only coming to manifest his attributes. Praise the Lord. And now he again says here that what I mean attributes was his thoughts a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking. And when he said let there be there was and let there be And there I was. And now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you are the manifestation of his thinking. Before there was even a world, you were in Christ, in God in the beginning. That makes you then you see his subjects. That makes you his subjects. And the whole thing is is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled. When I touch him, I am able to feel God because him is is the expression of God because before he was God. Praise the Lord. He was simply an eternal being, an eternal being. Praise the Lord. He was simply selfexisting, eternal. And the Bible says he used to move upon the face of the waters. Praise the Lord. Because he had not yet created man to worship him to make him the object of worship. So he was simply an eternal being. So now his thoughts wanted to be expressed. He makes something tangible that would manifest his attribute. that tangible thing. Let us create man in our own image in the image of God. Created he man, male and female, created he them. And then God breathed his air. He gave a part of him in this man to manifest his attributes. Praise the Lord. and says so he could not be handled sin and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing praise the lord I would quote in uh Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 I would quote James Genesis 126 where God say let us create man our own image and after Genesis 1:26 when we move Genesis 2:7. Now that's where God picked his spirit, his seat, and put in this box. Praise the Lord. And that seat &gt;&gt; is the reason Jesus Christ came to climb it back. Praise the Lord. Because that seed had been lost in this body, in the lusts of the flesh, in the desires of the body, in the affairs of men. Praise the Lord. And when God saw it, he was not pleased. So he made his plan. And Jesus came. When Jesus came, he came to die to seek and find. Not we seek him. He never said I came so those that were part of me could seek me. He came to seek. It is God seeking. It is God looking for you. It is God locating you. So when you believe it is not your ability, it is not your own works. It is not your own power. It is God looking for you. because we are part of him before the foundation of the world raised the Lord. You notice that Adam did not tell God what form he should look like but God in his thought when he created him. He said Adam should be in my own image. It was God that chose not Adam that did the choosing. It is God that chose us and we did not choose him. Praise the Lord. And that's what it is. By election, God looks for his seeds. By election, he has sent his servants. He sent prophets. He sent so many of them. And then when they all failed, he had to send his own son because by election, God had children. By election, he had brought his children into manifestation and they were out there. I want to tell you brothers. Each one of us is able to believe, each one of us is able to obey. Each one of us Is he able to recognize the voice of God? One because there is a seed of God in the in in there. Two, God gives us the grace to believe his word. Praise the Lord. This same word is preached every day to the rest of the world. But how many are able to organize this word and know that this is the word of God? This is the truth. Only those that were known before the foundation of the world. So you being here is a proof that you were known. You were chosen in him before the foundation of the world. Because when you had a voice, you were able to hear and recognize it. God gave you grace to have faith. Where does faith sit? Faith sits in the spirit. It is the spirit that has faith. That's the only thing that governs the spirit. So when the word is being preached, this word goes direct to the spirit. So if the spirit of God is not in you, this will sound like any other thing that you do. Praise the Lord. But if the spirit of God is in you, you will be able to hear and know that this is speaking to you. Praise the Lord. Because in you is that seed is that seed. Yet that seed is still the word of God manifested. So when he speaks and you say amen, you said amen because the seed was there. Praise the Lord and it received life. And now the more you hear, the more this word begins to water. Praise the Lord. The seed was dormant before you had the word of God. Praise the Lord. There was no desire for salvation before you had the word of God. But when you had the word of God, you felt the desire for salvation. You felt the desire for repentance. Why? Because when the word lands on the fertile ground, the seed must bring forth life. So now when it landed in your heart, in your spirit, it gave it faith. It it rejuvenated that faith. Praise the Lord. Then it began to grow to grow until it bore the fruit of faith to believe. Praise the Lord that this is the truth. Not of your works, but because he chose you. Praise the Lord. Not because you were very attentive, but because you were known of him before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. So it is it is and he says, so now when we say obedience to the voice, what is obedience? It is simply a response, a response to the word. Simply responding to the word because you have the faith to believe the word. So when you begin to obey, simply responding to the word of God. Praise the Lord. So you begin acting according to the word. Praise the Lord. So now the seed that is in us, that seed must grow. That seed must grow. &gt;&gt; And like in the natural when they throw a seed &gt;&gt; into the ground, praise the Lord. That seed may not grow if you don't water it. If it does not receive conducive environment, the seed will die. Praise the Lord. It must be watered. It must be given the right environment for it to grow. Unlike the seed in the ground, we are different because the seed that is in us, that seed can never die. Friends, the seed that you have in the first place, you've not received it today. No sir, you didn't receive it when you believed. No sir, that seed was already there before the foundation of the world. So that seed can never die. It is eternal. All it needs is to grow and manifest the attributes of the father. It needs the word of God because the spirit feeds on the word. That's why when you heard the word, you received energy to believe. You noticed that this is something that is speaking about God. But before you heard the word, it was business as usual. But when you hear this word, there is no way you can settle down there because the deep was called the deep &gt;&gt; and the deep has to respond and he said, "Father, forgive me. Forgive me. I am sorry for all the things I've committed." And as you are crying, it is the deep calling. The magnet is attractive. As you are crying and now you have things that you hold dear to yourself. And then you hear the word and say, "Thou shalt not do this." And says, "Father, I'm sorry. I have been doing this without my knowledge. You are coming until you come out and you get the magnet." And the moment you get there by way of the new birth, praise the Lord, there is no way you can ever get lost. Praise the Lord. We are the covenantal seed, chosen by election before the foundation of the world. Praise the living God. and Luke when Jesus came he says I have come to look for you Luke 19:2 and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho 192 It's okay. You can read. So you can read that. Okay. And he was sold to see Jesus. He and and he saw to see Jesus who he was and could not for the for the press, but he was little of stature. And he ran before and climbed up into a psycho tree to see him. And for he was to pass that way. He had Zakias had a desire. He had heard that Jesus was going to pass that way. And when he had a news, that news spoke his heart because in there was a seat. So he ran up there. He was a short man. So he could not see Jesus. But because of the desire in him. The deep was called into the deep. So he looked for how possible to see Jesus. And the Bible says, "And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, Zakius, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house. Because you have heard, you've expressed the desire. Today I must pass your way. Praise the Lord. That is his our desire. That was the desire of Zakas that he could see him. For him, his desire was to simply see him. And yet Christ, praise the Lord, had Zakayas in his mind before the foundation of the world. So when he passed that way, he knew there would be Zakayas with a desire to receive him. That's all God requires of us to simply express our desire and says because you have expressed your desire, today I will pass by your way. today I will abide with you and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it the rest of the people you see the world does not want to lose you the world does not want to lose us praise the Lord so when you hear Jesus coming your way &gt;&gt; and then you recognize that he is passing by. When he express your desire for him to come and abide with you, when he surely comes to call you out, the world does not want to lose you. So the world will begin to throw things against you. Praise the Lord to bring down your desire. Praise the Lord. But hold fast. It is in the right direction. It is in the right place that you are being called untrue. They said they began to mama saying verse seven that he was going to to be guest with a man that is a sinner. And Zakias, &gt;&gt; he never said he was wasn't a sinner. His desire was to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He never wanted to prove to anyone how good he was. He only wanted to receive Jesus because in him was the seed of God. Our desire is to see Jesus is not be good or better than anyone. Your desire as a Christian is to receive Jesus in your name. Praise the Lord. And Jesus when we express our desire, he will pass by. And stood and said unto the unto the unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore I restore him for fault. a repentant heart. Praise the Lord. He was trying to say no, you calling me a sinner. But now look, God, this is my desire. All I want is to be with you. Praise the Lord. And says, if I have done anything wrong, I am sorry. Jesus smiled and said, "That's not what I'm looking for. I have found you because the son of man came to look for you who was lost. And now that I have found you, Zakiah, that is my desire." Praise the Lord. Yes, repent. Praise the Lord. But my interest is the seed. Praise the Lord. is to perfect the seed that is in there which was a part of him before the foundation of the world for the son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost. Therefore Jesus said unto him, "This day is salvation, come to this house, for so much as he also is a son of Abraham." Zakius was in Abraham more than 2,000 years ago, but Jesus was able to see him. Praise the Lord that he was in Abraham. Abraham could not did not see Zakayas. Praise the Lord. But yet Zakayas existed in him. And now here was the manifestation of the seed of Abraham. Praise the Lord. We were in God. Praise the Lord. And now here we are simply manifestation of that which was in him. Friends, how do you look at yourself today? Don't look at yourself as a failure. Don't look at yourself as a sinner. Look at yourself as a son and daughter of God that existed in God before the foundation of the world. So if you existed, why call yourself a sinner? Praise the Lord. You are holy because he that is in you is holy. Praise the Lord. You've overcome the world because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world. The son of man simply came to seek for you and to entrust you with his power, entrust you with his authority. Because Jesus said that you see the things I have done, I am simply manifesting the attributes of my father. Praise the Lord. He walked on the water. He raised the dead. He healed the sick. And yet he said, "Greater things than this shall you do." Why? Because the power with which I have to make these miracles is the same power that rests in you. Praise the Lord. So now if we could look at ourselves as sons and daughters of God, praise the Lord. We shall have the courage to pick up when we fail because we know that the victory that we have is but not ours. It was already done for us God already ordered your way. He already ordered your path. All we got to do is to be patient with him. Praise the Lord. And he says here in the book of John 6:35, &gt;&gt; and Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you that you also have seen me and believe not. Praise the Lord. They had seen him yet they had not believed him. Why? All that the father giveth me shall come to me. And him that cometh to me, I will not in no wise cast out. That's the secret of salvation. Praise the Lord. Jesus, God makes him a go between. God makes him a go between. Praise the Lord. God locates each one of us and brings us close to him to hear the word, believe the word by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because the Bible says the faith that we have comes to us by hearing and hearing by the word of God. So you hear the word of God and by the word of God you receive faith to believe. Jesus said you have heard me yet you do not believe. Why? Because the father has not known you. But those who the father knew he will bring them to me. How? When they hear the word they will believe it. It is a finished work. It is a work that was done for you to believe. It is a work that was already done for you to believe. So when you you hear the word, you believe because God ordained you to believe. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. who has begotten us in him before the foundation of the world and he has predestated us and to the adoption of children. You see in the Old Testament when a father produced a son by birth this son belongs to the father. Praise the Lord by birth. The child has a right to be part of the father. And now the father brought this son and took this son to a family to be adopted. Praise the Lord. And so this child had to be mentored. And now until that child is fully matured that he has the attributes of the father and he has the capacity to hold his possessions. That's when he was brought back. And now when he when he was fully tutoed, taught by the one who adopted, instructed, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord and brought up well. Then when he was brought the father, he was adopted back to the family. He was adopted to have ownership to have the rights over the possession of his father. Not until he'd been tutored. There is no way he could be adopted into the family. We are sons of God by birth. Praise the Lord because it is him who begotten us who begot us before the foundation of the world. But then when we are born into the world, we have to be adopted back to the family by Jesus Christ. That's why he says unless my father gives you to me to adopt you into his family there is no way you can come to me. But we are so blessed that God he begot us and he begot us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And when he begot us, he got us and gave us over to Jesus to tutor us to nurture us. Praise the Lord. And when we are ready by the new birth, we adopted back into the family to have possession. That's why he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings, all the blessings that we have. Even those that you've not thought about, they are all ours because we have the first receive them. Praise the Lord. He has begotten us and he has given us all those spiritual blessings. Amen. Amen. And now he says, for I came down from heaven. Can you give a sound? Amen. I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me. And this is the father's will which has sent me that all o that all of which he has given me adoption. He got us and he gave us Christ. Praise the Lord. He got you in whatever condition of life. Even right now in whatever condition of lives you are in, God gave us over at Christ to tutor us to adopt us into his family. He says, "And this is the Father's will, which he has sent me, that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. Praise the Lord. And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone which seeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up on the last day. And no man can come to me except the father which sent me draw him. No man can come to me. There is no way you can come to Jesus. There is no you can believe Jesus except God. Who sent Jesus to redeem us to tutor us except God has drawn you to him and it has to be by predestination. It has to be by election. You must have been a part of him before he can draw you back to himself. No man can come to me except the father which sent me draw him and I raise him up at the last day. And he says it is written in the prophets that they shall be all taught of God. And every man therefore that has had and has learn of the father comes to me. Every man that has heard of the father. Praise the Lord. Oh, have you heard? Have you recognized this word? Have you heard a word? Do you recognize that it is coming from God? Have you recognized your father? Do you believe that you have been restored Jesus Christ? He says, "Every man that hears and learns of the father." So it begins with God and it has to end with God. Every man that has heard of the father and learn of him. That means it has to be God to teach you. He says there's no you can come to me even the very first day that you feel you believed. He said God was there teaching you. God was there all through the way. Even when you are still in the denominations, God was there with you. He was there teaching you. Praise the Lord. Because you are his seat and you are his seat and his seat can never be lost. So while you were down there, he still thought about you. He still thought about you. We were in his mind. Praise the Lord. You think about it, friends. Look at wherever we have come from. God was there with us. He was there speaking to us until when you heard the voice coming from inside and it spoke to you that this that you've heard is of God. Then you believed and you came. No man can come to me except the father draws him to me. But before the father draws him to me, no man can come except he has heard of the father and he has learned of the father. Then the father brings him to me to be tutored. There is no you can be brought to Christ to be tutoed unless you a part of god and Jesus Christ is the word of god. So you cannot come to the word unless God has drawn you. And God cannot draw you unless you were a part of him before the foundation of the world. Not any man has seen the father save he which is of God. No man has seen the father except that man is of the father. So you have seen, you have heard because you are of the father because the father knew you. Praise the Lord. That's our position in Christ. It is entirely determined of God. So we do not choose to be identified with God. But God does. Praise the Lord. You know how the children of Jesse, how Samuel was uh picking a king out of them. &gt;&gt; You see Jesse had children and now he brought the seven to the front and then the very first one he thought would be the choice of God. But that was not his choice. God had already chosen David to be king over Israel even before the foundation of the world. And now David was a reject he was looking after ship. And so when they ordered Jesse to bring his to be anointed, he never thought about David. So he brought these ones and the first were a giant. And even Samuel was convinced that this is the choice of God. And God spoke to Samuel and said, "No, do not anoint him. Him is not he that have chosen." They brought a second and all of them. And God had not accepted them because God had already elected someone to be. He had already elected someone by forn knowledge to be king over Israel. And Samuel so that they were all over. But he said he said there any other one left? Then was like but the one who is left he even smells sheep. He's always in the bush. He's not worthy to be brought close and says it is he who God has chosen to be king over Israel. The choice of God is not the choice of man. It is not dictated by who is not dictated by who we are. Is not dictated by how you look like. It is not dictated by what you have done. But it is what God has chosen. It's not what you have done, brother. It's not what I have done for God to choose us. But because he chose us in him before the foundation of the world. So you are here today because you are God's perfect choice. You are here because you are his seed by election. There is nothing man can do to deserve salvation. Doing good is just fine. But God has not chosen you based on your good works. He's chosen you because he already chose you before the foundation of the world. He knew you and chose you to be adopted and the children of promise. Ephesians 2:10, by grace are you saved through faith, &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. So you can start from eight. So you are saved by grace. He chose you by his own grace. He chose you by his own love because he loved you as his children and he's not ready to lose each one of us. That's how he chose us. Not because we were good-looking. No, David wasn't good-looking, but he was God's perfect choice. His father could not see the attributes of God in him. Yet in him were the attributes of a warrior, an overcomer. But because was a small boy, his father could not see those attributes. And yet God saw his own attributes in David. Because David had been chosen. God has not chosen us based on anything. He has chosen us because he loved us and he already chose us in him before the foundation of the world. He says not of works lest any man should boast. You would say, "Oh, I fasted and prayed. I saw the face of God. I had to pray for 30 days and fasted and then I found God." You can't boast. He just chose you because he loved you. For we are his workmanship. That's why he chose you. created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them before you even are God ordained how you should walk it's not by mistake what your path has been. It is all God. God has ordained our parts even before we were into existence because he said we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works. So you can't boast of your good works. No, it has to be the grace of God. By grace, by grace are you saved. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:1 has told us according as he has chosen us. Verse two, grace be to you and peace. from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the God and attribute. Paul was worshiping. He was magnifying God. The spirit of God was upon him. He said, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heaven places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him by grace. He has chosen us by grace. you are saved before the foundation of the world that you are going to be holy and without blame. The world may see like a sinner yet God sees one that is holy because he has ordained you to be holy and it is his duty to make you holy. God will make you holy. God will help you overcome. God will help you overcome every challenge, every weakness. Why? Because when he came, his Bible says he has to create out of us a church that has no spot or wrinkle. That church is not coming from the angels. That church is you and me. Regardless of your weaknesses, God says he's creating out of you a church that has no spot or wrinkle. It is his duty to create that church out of you because he has chosen you in him before the foundation of the world and given you the grace to be saved, to be a son of God, to be a daughter of God. That's what it is. Not of our works, not our abilities, but because he has chosen us. 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7. For God has not given us the spirit of fear. For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. Who has saved us and called us with unholy calling? Not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace. which was given in Christ Jesus before the world began. Recognizing your position, that's where we are in Christ. We were saved. And God called us with unholy calling to be holy without spot or wrinkle, not according to our works of righteousness, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us. So he gave us the grace to be saved. He gave us the grace to be sons of God. and daughters of God in Christ before the world began. So where is your victory? Your victory was in Christ before even the world began. That's how we can see ourselves as Christians. We are a finished work. We are a finished work. Even before the world began, you had overcome. Even before the world began, you had a power to overcome. You had a grace to overcome. He chose us unconditionally. He he said, "Not of your works. He chose you unconditionally. My son, I didn't choose him to be my son because he did something unconditionally. He's my son. You are a son and daughter of God. Not because there is any condition in there. No, unconditionally because you are his seed. When he chose Israel, he never chose them because they were good people. We know how Israel was stiffnecked people, very hard. God does something today, then tomorrow they forget and complain. But yet God chose them and he called him his people. And he told them in Deuteronomy 7 verse 6, for thou art unholy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord God has chosen you to be a special people. You have not chosen him above all people that are upon the face of the earth. And it says, "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you because you were in you were more in number than any people, for you were the fewest. But because the Lord loved you, because he would keep the oath which he had swn unto your fathers, Has the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand? &gt;&gt; Verse N. Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him, and keep his commandments to a thousand generations. How do you love him? Because he first loved you. Not of your works, not your abilities. He loved us because we were in him before the foundation of the world. You love your children, you fathers with no condition because those children were in you before they existed. It's unconditional love. He said, "I loved you." &gt;&gt; Not because you did so great things, but because he has chosen you to be his special people special because there is a special thing in you which identifies you with God. That thing identifies you with God. That is the life of God in you. That is the spirit of God in you. His seed which he created before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. I have made you a special people. Praise the Lord. That's what God does according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. And the prophet quotes I quote him in the message the believer's position in Christ the believer's position in Christ. Now if we can find our position and know that it is God's word that has promised it. If we as believers in our weaknesses, in our points of failures can recognize our position and know that it is God's word that has promised that position to us. He says that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear that they could take the promised land. because they had been promised. It is God who gave a promise. It is God who has said, "I have called you. I have chosen you. You have not chosen me." It is God who has said all that he has brought Christ, all them that he has called Christ, he shall lose none. Why do you get worried? You will make it, brother. We shall all make it. Not because you have the ability to make it, but because God has ordained it, it's a finished work. Not our abilities. Cuz he chose us. He just chose us. Joshua and Calb, they don't look at what the rest of the people said. They had a promise. They believed the promise and God gave them grace to execute the promise. That's all we we pray for that God may give us the grace to understand him in every situation to understand him. The prophet says in some message, the greatest battle ever fought that when he locates you and you recognize him, you come to a battle. You come to a battlefield. But even in the battlefield, you simply have to him that he is the war captain. That's what he said to Moses. Just lift up your hands. Keep them up. Moses did not know the magic, but he recognized the voice and he believed it and he did it. Each time his hands were up, Israel prevailed. Just recognize God in every one of our situations. Just recognize our positions, who we are in him. And that settles it. There will be no worries. Oh brother, I don't know whether I'll make it. Oh sister, I don't know whether I'll make it. you are making it is not determined by who you are. It was predestinated before the foundation of the world. And he says, you can't look at this sense of reasoning. You've got to look at the promise of God. Sometimes situations take us to a moment of reasoning. I'm like, but surely am I a daughter or a son of God? You are a daughter and son of God. He says, don't look at that sense. God had already sent his angel and the angel was in the camp moving with the children of Israel and the revelation of God had brought the word of God manifested. And now they was ready to push into the promised land. Grace unto you and peace from God our father from the Lord Jesus Christ. He says he's given his salute all his salutation to the church. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and he says think of it. He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings. Don't think yourself poor. You could be poor, but don't think of yourself poor. Believe God. Trust God. He says, "I am the Lord God who health all your diseases and supplies all your needs. He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings." And he says, But he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Did you think of that? He chose us in him before the foundation of the world. That we should be holy. Not because I lived right, but because he chose me to be that way. He done it, not I. that we should be holy. That's the reason you are holy this afternoon. Not because you deserve it, but because he chose you to be that way. When did he do it? When you believed? No, sir. When you had no s before the foundation of the world holy without blame before him in love. How could he do it? There had to be a masterpiece. Do it. Do that. And that was Jesus Christ. Now, back there before the foundation of the world, God chose you in Jes in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world. Do you see it? Think about it, friends, that me, God chose me to be holy before the foundation of the world. So now which force can take away my holiness? There is nothing. Paul says, what shall we then say? If God is for us who can be against us, who can be against us? If he has chosen us before the foundation of the world and we are in him, then who can be against us? What shall we say to the things that Christ has done for us? Will tribulation separate us? Who can separate us from this love with which he loved us and chose us and he begot us in him and he has adopted us into his family. What can separate us from that love? It's not hunger. No sir. It's not sickness. It's not tribulation. It's not things present, nor things to come that shall ever separate us from the love of God which we have in Christ Jesus. According now listen close according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Who is the us there? the church. &gt;&gt; You, me, we are the us. He has chosen us. He chose us in him before the foundation. He chose us in Christ. The earth that we should be holy without blame. Who did it? God did it. God knowed from the beginning who would be saved and who would not be saved. That's why he said you have not believed me. You have not believed yet you've heard because no man can come to me except my father draw him. So who did it? It is the father because he knowed from the beginning who would be saved and who would not be saved. Certainly he was he was not willing for any to perish. But he didn't send Jesus here just to see just to see if you would act or you you would not act well. Poor Jesus, I feel sorry for him. Oh, maybe I would better get saved and approve it. No, sir. That's not why he sent Jesus. God knoweth in the beginning who would and who not. So therefore he knew that some would. So he sent Jesus to make appropriation for those that he forneew. Praise the Lord. That's why he sent Jesus. For those who he forneew. By the fact that we are here today, we are those that he forneew by the fact that we have believed him. We are those that he forneew before the foundation of the world. For those who he forneew, he has called. As that he forneew, he has called. And those he who he has called, he has justified. And those who he has justified, he has past tense glorified. There you are. He forneew you. He called you. He has justified you. And then he has glorified you to be holy in him without any blemish. So how can you say it's something you could do? It's nothing you can do. It's God is love and grace to you that you are even here. Nothing you could do but God called you by his grace. You listened, &gt;&gt; you heard, you accepted because in you is a seed, a seed life of God that hears and responds to the things of God. He has chosen us. He has called us. He has justified us. He has glorified us. And he says in questions and answers, I stood out yonder where that big glass you I stood up where that big glass where that big glass you can see 120 million years of light space. He was standing up there. The prophet says when I looked and seen that I didn't get to see through the glass. But I seen the picture where they took it. I just had to raise up my hands in there in that place. And I said, "How great thou art, how great thou art." And before one of those planets ever turned, before any of those planets ever turned, &gt;&gt; planets God chose us in Christ Jesus. Now, how great thou art. Before there was a world, before there was a planet, before there was a sun, before there was a moon, before there was anything, when it was still God, God and his thoughts, the eternal thoughts of God shows you by predestination. He chose you by forn knowledge to know that you would be on earth to know there would be sin. So if he knew, if God knew us and chose us before the world was then why the fall? Why the fall? He say someone said why was there sin? Why was there sin? If there would never been sin, his attributes would have never have been a savior. There had to be a sinner so he could be a savior. There had to be a sick man so he could be a healer. There you are. It had to be that way. It it was God who saw it and for day in it. The devil ain't even in a picture. He's just a stamp on the side at a stamp at the side of the road that God used to bring children to him crying aba father. Praise the Lord. No wonder on that day how the angels will sing when we are singing the redemption stories the songs of victory. Praise the Lord. How we have overcome how we have been reconciled. How we've overcome the world. Oh, she says we will be singing redemption stories and the angels will bow their heads. Why? because they don't know what we are talking about. Praise the Lord. They were not lost in the first place. They never know what sin is. They don't have any weaknesses. But you looking at your weaknesses and seeing yourself out there. [screaming] You shall sing redemptive song, songs of victory. Praise the Lord, songs of joy because you made it there. Not by your ability, but because he chose you to be there. He says, "And angels will bow their heads." They don't know what you're talking about. They don't know what you have been through. You have been hungry and you've slept without food. Yet, you've not rejected the word. You've been through struggles, financial struggles, and yet you have not rejected the word. You have been through sickness. You have been through sin, and yet you have not given up. The angels can't understand that because they have not been through it. He says they don't know how good we feel. know how good we feel to know that we which were once sinners and alienated from God without hope without mercy without God in a world of corruption dying going to a devil's hell and God stooped down &gt;&gt; and picked us up and redeemed us and now we are above the angels right now. Nothing did it. It is his love that did it. His love paid for my sins. His love taken it away. Love is the most powerful force there is. God loved us. Love chosen us in love before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. That love constrained him provide for our fall constrained him to provide for our fall. It constrained him to make a plan of redemption, a plan to preserve his seed. Because being an all- knowing God, he knew the diversions that would surface in the world. And he laid a lamp, Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; to die and let his blood cleanse us from all sin. He loved you. He loved you before there was a world. Do you believe that? He loved you. He knowed your nature. Look at yourself. God loved you. Even in your nature, he loved you anyhow because it's not him that gave you that nature. It is the body and life you born in. But he loved you anyhow. Because in you is his life. And that life will somehow fight through and overcome this nature to present you as a holy vessel before him in love. And then he looked all over the great universe and it was he said I choose you. And when he did that before there was even a speck of light then you were eternal with God. When you receive the Holy Ghost, when you receive the Holy Ghost, then you become eternal because you are with God. You are part of God. Can you see what I mean? You are as eternal as God is. You are as eternal as God is because you are his seed. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 7:22 says, "For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in that day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. But this thing commanded I them, saying, "Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people and walk in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you. Verse 23. &gt;&gt; 23. Okay. Obey the voice of God. Just obey his word and he will be he'll take care of us. Praise the Lord. So what when we you fall into trials or temptation when we fall into such trials and temptation. Praise the Lord. When trials come, you go to stand on the basis that you are a covenantal seat that it is God that has brought you to this battlefield. Regardless of the trial, be reminded that it is God that started your journey. It has to be God to finish it. Stand firm. Believe God and let God move. It is God that loved you, that chose you, and it is God that will protect you. Praise the Lord. The prophet says now you've got if now if you've got a way that you say ups and downs ups and downs ups you say ups and downs ups and downs. Praise the Lord. Ups and downs. I would advise you to go to God and stay there until you are really born again. When trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments set in something holds, not you holding, something holding you. It isn't a question whether I hold or not. It's a question whether he held or not. It isn't looking at me. It's looking at him. Praise the Lord. He says when trouble set in, you know your position. Praise the Lord. It is not you that is holding on to him. Praise the Lord. It's not a question whether you are holding on to him or not. Praise the Lord. It is him that held or held not. But if it is him that held you, he will still hold you in that situation. Why? Because you are his he to be a part of him. Praise the Lord. So because I stand on the foundation that he he by fornowledge knew me and one condition of life and what condition of life I would be. this particular time and how I will come out of it. He knows my end from the beginning because this is what makes him God. I stand on the basis that I have believed him and obeyed his word when he called me and now I am certain that he will take over my mind and to help me look beyond my trial. and look away to Jesus because he is the author and finisher of my faith. So when I'm into trouble, I am certain. He says, "Be still. Be still. Be still and know that I am God." Praise the Lord. Not how much you hold on to. situations come. Praise the Lord. And you feel so weak to hold on. But even in that situation, praise the Lord. It does not matter whether you hold on or not. What matters is that he held you. Praise the Lord. What matters is that he's still holding you. Just be still &gt;&gt; and know that he is God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And he says in the message, redemption by judgment, now we base our thoughts this morning as people coming to be prayed for. We can base our thoughts this this evening, this afternoon that God has prom what that God has promised. If you were here this morning, you'd say, "Well, brother Brham, brother Bill, I've had an up and down in life and others have had challenges in life. I've always wanted to live a Christian life. I just never could get myself settled down. Well, I can base my promise my faith to this to my brother, sister this morning. If you will make that complete consecration right now, don't wait till you come up to the altar. He says you can come up here and say I now have accepted it. But right where you are now, he say God be merciful to me, a backslider or a sinner, whatever it is. And I now base my hopes on nothing but your word, I believe it. And he says, "Then brother, something is going to take place because you you've got a real foundation for God in no way can cast you out. Temptations come. There will never be a temptation unless he gives you grace to bear it. He's promised to meet you on every battle front right there. He will bless. He will bless you. That's where your hope is. You'll get to the place. You say, "Well, brother Bill, I have so many temptations." Tell me one Christian that doesn't have temptation. We never come to a picnic. We've come to a battleground. We are out here to fight the enemy. Why sure we don't put on our armor just be looked at. If you be if you became a Christian just be looked at then you are I'm afraid you go I'm afraid you got in the wrong place. Christian sometimes is looked down upon or made fun of. But we come as a warrior come sprinkled in the blood. The old raggedy cross going before us. The morning star lighting up the way. Why? We are on our road somewhere. Don't care what the word says. What God said, the field belongs to us. The field belongs to us. The field belongs to us. Praise the Lord. The field belongs to us because God said so. It is a promise. We are on the road. He promised us eternal life. No matter what the devil says about it, we are sure we have eternal life because he promised it, it belongs to us. Whether whatever temptation the devil brings our way. Whatever trial the devil brings our way, the Bible says there is no temptation, that shall come our way beyond which we can overcome. Because in every temptation, in every trial, he gives us sufficient grace to overcome it. Praise the Lord. He says, "Yes, sir. There is nothing to be scared about. Even if this earth tabernacle is gone, we've got one already waiting yonder. There is nothing to be scared about." Yes sir. Everything belongs to us because Christ has redeemed it all to us through him and he loved us. And we could not come to him unless God rose us to him. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. And he said, "No man can come to me except my father draws him to me first. All that comes I'll give everlasting life and will raise him up at the last day. What worry have we got at all? There is nothing to worry about. Nothing to be scared about because all that we are, all that we shall be was known before the foundation of the world. If it is eternal life, it was given to us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world. Praise the Lord. So all we got to do is to believe God in every situation. Recognize who you are that you finished work. Then when you learn into fa trials, reorganize God. That is he who started the work. It is he that is going to bring to a completion because he knows the end. From the beginning, he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy without any blame before him in love. And he gives us eternal life. Praise the Lord. Not because we negotiated for it, but we are mandated to receive it. Because in us is the seed of God which shall never die. When recognize that position, we rest the case. In trials, you rest the case. In temptations, you rest the case. Praise the Lord. In tribulations, you rest your case. Praise the Lord. Because you know God is in care. He's in total control. He is taking care of everything. Praise the Lord. What then shall we say? Praise the Lord. Romans 8:28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose. interpret for whom he did for know. He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. He for one knew you. He for one knew me. Praise the Lord. to be conformed to the image of his son. Praise the Lord. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called. So because he predestinated us, he knew us before the foundation of the world. So he also called us. Praise the Lord. And them that he called, he also justified. He also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified. What then shall we say these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He has loved us. He loves you brother. He loves you sister. You are here this afternoon because he loves you. You are here this afternoon because he chose you. You have not believed today. You didn't believe the day you you think you believed and you did not receive salvation on the day you accepted this message. Salvation has always been a part of you because he saved you and he g he gave you grace before the foundation of the world. If he has done all the things for us, what then shall we say? It is him that loved us. It is him that chose us in him before the foundation of the world. So we are overcomers. We are victorious. We overcome every situation because he that is in us is much greater that any situation that shall come before us in this world be assured of your victory. Be assured of your eternal life. Why? Because he has already done it for us. So we are simply coming to manifest it. the manifestation of the sons of God. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God by grace, by predestination, by forn knowledge, not of our own works, but because he loved us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. Because he fast love me and sm Oh, God. I love him. I love him. I love it because he found love me. I might [screaming] s All come free.
