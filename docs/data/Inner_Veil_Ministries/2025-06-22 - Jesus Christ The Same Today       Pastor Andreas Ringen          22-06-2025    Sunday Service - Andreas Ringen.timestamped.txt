[47:56] and said to them, "Where is your faith?
[48:01] Because you prayed,
[48:05] oh night
[48:08] you've held on with all of your might.
[48:13] God your cries

[49:16] And you're thinking that you will surely
[49:20] drown.
[49:22] You've cried out for help from the
[49:25] Savior
[49:28] and you know you can't give up now
[49:33] because you prayed
[49:36] all night
[49:39] and you've held on with all of your
[49:42] might.

[50:35] your frightened were nowhere to run.
[50:40] And by now your vessel is feeling

[50:57] And you know you can't give up now

[51:52] asleep.
[51:54] The winds are so deadly. The waters so
[51:58] deep. But try to be patient cuz sin will
[52:03] bring peace. Just one word from his
[52:07] voice and it all will cease
[52:14] because you pray
[52:18] all night
[52:20] cuz you held on with all of your might.
[52:25] Without your Christ,

[53:34] [Applause]
[53:38] [Music]
[53:40] God bless you.
[53:42] Amen. They prayed all night.
[53:45] They prayed all night
[53:49] and the storms were beating on the boat.
[53:55] They had to wake up the master.
[54:02] Amen. Amen. And you know when he woke
[54:04] up,
[54:06] he proved he was the master of the sea.
[54:11] In all your problems, in all your
[54:14] trials,
[54:16] remember
[54:17] the one who first of all circumstances
[54:22] is not from you.
[54:25] Just turn a little bit
[54:27] and say, "Master,
[54:30] we perish."
[54:32] He will raise
[54:35] and take over the situation.
[54:38] Amen. Amen. So we are happy to be here
[54:41] tonight
[54:44] before the presence of the Lord
[54:48] where two or three
[54:51] are gathered together.
[54:53] You see the one thing is two.
[54:57] The minimum
[54:59] is two. And you know the two
[55:03] come together
[55:05] because every one of them
[55:08] is connected to the master.
[55:11] Amen. Amen. So he's not just here
[55:15] but is here
[55:18] in his name.
[55:20] In his name.
[55:23] Amen. The character, the nature,
[55:26] everything. If we have two or three
[55:31] in that character, in that nature this
[55:34] morning,
[55:36] then nothing shall stand before us.
[55:40] Amen. Not even. Amen. Are you gathered
[55:43] in his name?
[55:46] That's what makes a difference.
[55:49] So, we are happy this morning to be
[55:51] here.
[55:53] and brother Andreas back with us.

[56:44] eat in faith and it will work a work in
[56:48] your life.

[56:54] opportunity
[56:56] to welcome our brother
[56:59] to step over
[57:02] and speak to the body of Christ.
[57:06] Can we give a praise to the Lord?
[57:11] And when he came,
[57:14] he was asking
[57:16] his brother around.
[57:20] Yeah. I don't know why,
[57:22] but he's there. You are the interpreter
[57:25] of choice.
[57:29] Praise the Lord.
[57:31] Amen. Amen. So we appreciate brother

[1:01:30] uh so uh uh if it is here in different
[1:01:34] other places
[1:01:36] and it's sometimes very amazing
[1:01:40] how God brings people together
[1:01:45] and if I see that God brings you

[1:02:36] to further the gospel.
[1:02:39] We see the current world events.
[1:02:45] So many things have been fulfilled.
[1:02:48] Brother Brandham spoke of.
[1:02:51] Amen. Amen. The prophet would let us
[1:02:53] know
[1:02:56] there would come a pope out of the
[1:02:58] United States.
[1:03:00] And here we are.
[1:03:03] We understand how close we are.
[1:03:06] We see what is going on worldwide.
[1:03:10] Amen. The time is there.
[1:03:13] The time of the change is very close.
[1:03:19] And one of these days our bodies will be
[1:03:22] changed.
[1:03:24] This mortality
[1:03:27] will put on immortality.
[1:03:29] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:03:32] It's not just a dream.
[1:03:35] It will happen in our day.
[1:03:37] This is the hour for it.
[1:03:40] And we are here on earth
[1:03:43] to be part of it.
[1:03:46] What a what a great time. And as also I
[1:03:49] want to say thank you for the special
[1:03:52] for the for the singing.
[1:03:56] As a minister,
[1:03:58] you are always careful.
[1:04:01] You just want to see the Holy Spirit
[1:04:03] leading.
[1:04:06] Amen. Amen. And so I'm so grateful
[1:04:09] as the sisters were singing and the
[1:04:11] brothers.
[1:04:14] It's so simple.
[1:04:16] But you understand,
[1:04:18] we are called for prayer.
[1:04:21] Amen. Amen. And as they were sitting
[1:04:23] with Jesus in the boat,
[1:04:27] they had to wake him up.
[1:04:31] They had to wake him up.
[1:04:34] It was not magic what they needed to do.
[1:04:41] just the necessary,
[1:04:44] wake him up.
[1:04:46] So you don't have to do magic
[1:04:51] to bring him on the scene.
[1:04:54] Just do the things that is necessary.
[1:04:59] Just wake him up.
[1:05:02] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:05:05] wonderful joining in with what the Lord
[1:05:08] put on my heart.
[1:05:12] Hallelujah. So we I I we we know that
[1:05:15] the Lord is already present
[1:05:20] that the Lord has something in store for
[1:05:21] us.
[1:05:24] Amen. I just want to see that not only
[1:05:26] in the ministry.
[1:05:28] I want to see the move of God amongst
[1:05:30] the people,
[1:05:35] amongst each and every one of us
[1:05:39] because this is a body move.
[1:05:42] Amen. Amen. The rapture is a body move.
[1:05:48] We all will be changed.
[1:05:51] Not just only one or two or three.
[1:05:55] We all shall be changed.
[1:05:57] This is what Paul told us.
[1:06:00] Not only a few here and there,
[1:06:03] Paul said, "We all shall be changed
[1:06:07] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye."
[1:06:10] So that's why I need you
[1:06:13] and you need me for our bodies to be
[1:06:16] changed.
[1:06:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we want to
[1:06:20] use the time we have
[1:06:23] to prepare ourselves.
[1:06:26] The prophet would say that is the duty
[1:06:29] of the bride
[1:06:32] to close herself
[1:06:35] be because she was arraigned in fine
[1:06:38] linen
[1:06:40] but the Bible says the bride had made
[1:06:43] herself ready.
[1:06:46] Amen. Amen. The bride has made herself
[1:06:50] and we want to take this morning
[1:06:53] the garment of the word
[1:06:56] and put it on.
[1:06:58] Do we want to put it on this morning?
[1:07:01] Put it on means you accept
[1:07:06] what God gives you.
[1:07:10] It's wonderful to hold it,
[1:07:14] but that's not enough.
[1:07:16] You have to accept it.
[1:07:19] You have to accept what God has done for
[1:07:21] you.
[1:07:22] Calvary has happened.
[1:07:25] You have to accept what God has done for
[1:07:28] you. As you accept it,
[1:07:32] this means you put it on.
[1:07:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:07:38] Amen. Uh let us stand together
[1:07:42] for the reading of the words.
[1:07:45] And we want to read three scriptures.
[1:07:49] Amen. Very known scriptures.
[1:07:52] Uh actually a year ago, a year ago,
[1:07:57] I was touching on the same points
[1:08:01] and I want to speak touch on it again.
[1:08:05] This time a little bit in a different
[1:08:07] approach.
[1:08:09] Amen. Because the word is unfolding.
[1:08:13] Is that right? The word is unfolding.
[1:08:16] It's the same Bible,
[1:08:18] but it's a new book.
[1:08:21] That means it's more unfolding.
[1:08:25] Amen. Amen. Do you see Jesus Christ?
[1:08:28] In every scripture,
[1:08:31] if you don't see him, the prophet say go
[1:08:34] and read it again
[1:08:36] because he's there.
[1:08:40] And Jesus Christ is not alone this
[1:08:43] morning.
[1:08:45] If you read the scripture
[1:08:48] and you don't see yourself in this,
[1:08:51] read it again.
[1:08:54] Amen. Amen. Genesis 15.
[1:08:59] Genesis 15.
[1:09:02] And I want to speak this morning
[1:09:06] on Jesus Christ
[1:09:09] the same.
[1:09:12] Jesus Christ the same today.
[1:09:19] Amen. Amen. Do you believe he's the same
[1:09:21] today?
[1:09:25] Do you believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:09:27] today?
[1:09:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:32] Amen. Jesus Christ is the same today.
[1:09:37] Genesis 15:1-6.
[1:09:43] It's about Abraham.
[1:09:45] After these things, the word of the Lord
[1:09:47] came to Abraham in a vision, saying,
[1:09:49] "Fear not, Abraham. I'm thy shield, and
[1:09:52] that is exceeding great reward.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:09] Amen. Just only one verse after these
[1:10:12] things.
[1:10:14] If we understand here Abraham
[1:10:17] had done something
[1:10:20] and Abraham need to do something
[1:10:23] as we as the sisters were were singing
[1:10:26] in the song.
[1:10:28] You have to wake him up.
[1:10:32] You have to wake him up.
[1:10:35] Amen. Can we say amen to that?
[1:10:39] Now here the Bible said
[1:10:42] after these things.
[1:10:45] So obviously
[1:10:48] Abraham had done something
[1:10:53] and after Abraham had done something,
[1:10:57] God came to him in a vision.
[1:11:01] Amen. So it's so important that we
[1:11:04] understand what God wants us to do in
[1:11:07] this.
[1:11:10] You have to awaken
[1:11:13] and then he speaks to the storm.
[1:11:16] You have to awake him and then he takes
[1:11:19] over.
[1:11:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's go to
[1:11:24] Genesis 18:1-9.
[1:11:29] Very very amazing scripture.
[1:11:33] And so simple and I trust you you watch
[1:11:35] carefully.
[1:11:38] Watch Abraham here.
[1:11:41] Genesis 18
[1:11:44] 1 1-9.
[1:11:45] And the Lord appeared unto him in the
[1:11:47] plains of Me as he said in the tent door
[1:11:49] in the heat of the day.
[1:11:52] [Music]
[1:11:59] And he lift up his eyes and looked. And
[1:12:02] lo, three men stood by him. And when he
[1:12:04] saw them, he ran to meet them from the
[1:12:06] tent door and bowed himself towards the
[1:12:10] ground.
[1:12:26] and said, "My Lord, if now I have found
[1:12:28] favor in thy sight, pass not away, I
[1:12:31] pray thee, from thy servant,
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:41] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[1:12:43] comfort your heart, your hearts. After
[1:12:45] that ye shall pass on, for therefore are
[1:12:47] you come to your servant." And they
[1:12:50] said, "So do as thou has said.
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:07] Now, now watch what Abraham is doing
[1:13:09] now.
[1:13:11] I just just so simple, but watch what
[1:13:14] Abraham is doing now.
[1:13:17] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto
[1:13:19] Sarah and said, "Make ready quickly free
[1:13:23] measures of fine meal needed, and make
[1:13:25] cake upon the earth.
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:46] And Abraham ran unto the herd and
[1:13:48] fetched a calf tender and good, and gave
[1:13:50] it unto a young man. He hasted to dress
[1:13:52] it.
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:10] Amen. Amen. And he took butter and milk
[1:14:13] and cow which he had dressed and set it
[1:14:15] before them and they stood by under the
[1:14:17] tree and they did eat.
[1:14:30] [Music]
[1:14:34] And they said unto him, "Where is Sarah,
[1:14:36] thy wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the
[1:14:38] tent."
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand?
[1:14:50] You have to wake him.
[1:14:54] You have to wake him.
[1:14:56] Then he comes and takes over.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:15:04] This morning
[1:15:06] you have to wake him.
[1:15:09] This morning you have to call him in
[1:15:12] your life.
[1:15:14] This morning you have to do something
[1:15:18] for him to do the rest.
[1:15:23] Let's turn one more scripture.
[1:15:28] Hebrews 13 verse 8
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:36] verse 8.
[1:15:42] It's a very
[1:15:44] very
[1:15:46] strange sentence.
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:52] You ready?
[1:15:54] We just only want to read that verse.
[1:15:58] And while reading it,
[1:16:01] you will recognize
[1:16:03] that words cannot stand alone.
[1:16:08] That verse
[1:16:10] is a result.
[1:16:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:16:19] today and forever.
[1:16:27] Let's say that together.
[1:16:30] Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] the same
[1:16:34] yesterday
[1:16:36] and today
[1:16:38] and forever.
[1:16:41] Let us pray. Heavenly Father,
[1:16:44] We thank you for your grace and mercy.
[1:16:47] Thank you for all that you have done.
[1:16:50] Take thy servant, Father, I pray,
[1:16:53] take him aside
[1:16:55] and anoint him for service,
[1:16:58] the words of eternal eternal life will
[1:17:00] come forth
[1:17:03] and that the atmosphere is can can be
[1:17:06] created
[1:17:08] that it is pleasing unto you. Father we
[1:17:11] pray. Take every wrong thing under
[1:17:14] control.
[1:17:16] Inspire us. Help us
[1:17:19] so that you you can reveal yourself
[1:17:21] amongst us.
[1:17:23] Father, all what we do.
[1:17:25] All what we say shall be to your honor
[1:17:29] and to your glory.
[1:17:31] And we commit us for service
[1:17:34] into your hands in Jesus Christ name.
[1:17:39] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Maybe.
[1:17:43] Amen.
[1:17:45] As we have read these three scriptures
[1:17:48] and maybe I I just want to start with
[1:17:52] something brother Brandham is saying
[1:17:56] as a prophet would speak
[1:17:59] speaking of Abraham.
[1:18:01] And we understand we want to see Jesus
[1:18:04] Christ.
[1:18:07] Amen. We want to see Jesus Christ.
[1:18:11] yesterday
[1:18:12] because if we understand Jesus Christ
[1:18:14] yesterday
[1:18:17] then we might understand Jesus Christ of
[1:18:19] today
[1:18:23] and this scripture
[1:18:26] of Hebrew Ruth 13:8
[1:18:31] I would say is one of the key scriptures
[1:18:36] that the prophet used
[1:18:39] one of the key scriptures.
[1:18:43] Amen. Amen. That he used to the entire
[1:18:45] his entire ministry.
[1:18:49] Actually,
[1:18:51] brother Brandham spoke about Hebrews
[1:18:53] 13:8
[1:18:57] more than 1,700 times.
[1:19:03] Amen. Amen. So he he that's that's
[1:19:06] scripture
[1:19:08] and I want you to to uh to to want you
[1:19:11] to recognize
[1:19:14] there's re revelation 13:8
[1:19:19] Revelation 13:8
[1:19:24] speaks of another man manifestation
[1:19:28] and it said like this and all that dwell
[1:19:31] upon the earth shall worship him whose
[1:19:35] names are not written in the book of
[1:19:37] life of the lamb slain from the
[1:19:40] foundation of the world.
[1:19:42] So that's revelation 13:8.
[1:19:46] So revelation 13:8
[1:19:49] is speaking of people
[1:19:52] that will worship
[1:19:54] Satan. Amen. That will just make him
[1:19:58] that will manifest him. In Hebrews 13:8
[1:20:04] speaks of people that make Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] the same yesterday, today and
[1:20:13] you understand that
[1:20:16] Revelation 13:8
[1:20:19] speaks of people
[1:20:21] that will worship the beast
[1:20:24] and while worshiping the beast
[1:20:26] they manifest the beast.
[1:20:29] So they helped the beast
[1:20:32] to be the same today.
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:35] The same works
[1:20:38] that he did years ago.
[1:20:40] Remember what is happening today is not
[1:20:44] new. It was Rome in the beginning. It
[1:20:47] was the beast in the beginning. It was
[1:20:50] the beast in the garden of Eden. It was
[1:20:53] the beast in the middle of the Bible.
[1:20:57] And it is the beast at the end of the
[1:20:59] Bible.
[1:21:01] Amen. Can you see that? It was the image
[1:21:04] of the beast
[1:21:06] in the beginning of the Bible
[1:21:09] in the middle of the Bible and in the
[1:21:12] end of the Bible. Hallelujah.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah. But when you see the the
[1:21:16] beast or the image of the beast, you
[1:21:20] also see Christ
[1:21:22] and the image of Christ.
[1:21:25] You see Christ in the beginning of the
[1:21:26] Bible. You see Christ in the middle of
[1:21:29] the Bible and you see Christ in the end
[1:21:32] of the Bible.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can
[1:21:36] we see how that runs parallel
[1:21:40] and what we see what we see today?
[1:21:43] The whole world is worshiping.
[1:21:46] Is it right?
[1:21:48] Yes sir. The Bible would say, "And all
[1:21:52] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[1:21:55] him."
[1:21:57] Who is him? Satan the beast.
[1:22:01] All shall worship him.
[1:22:03] Did you ever thought
[1:22:05] how that worship will manifest?
[1:22:09] You know when Jesus was was with the
[1:22:13] woman at the well
[1:22:15] he was making a very striking point
[1:22:19] and he's saying he said the father
[1:22:23] looks for worshiper
[1:22:26] that worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:22:30] Is that right? So under worship
[1:22:34] we worship today.
[1:22:36] You worship someone
[1:22:40] not so much how you worship
[1:22:44] but it is important who you worship.
[1:22:49] Amen. Is that right? And worship means
[1:22:52] much more than singing.
[1:22:55] Worship means much more than kneeling
[1:22:57] down.
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:01] Worship is worship is a lifestyle.
[1:23:07] Worship is a lifestyle.
[1:23:10] Your lifestyle
[1:23:13] is a worship
[1:23:15] to the beast or a worship to God.
[1:23:19] And Jesus was telling the woman at the
[1:23:21] well,
[1:23:23] the way you live now,
[1:23:26] you are worshiping Satan.
[1:23:29] Amen.
[1:23:31] He said to the woman at the well, "The
[1:23:34] father is seeking worship,
[1:23:37] then worship him in spirit and truth."
[1:23:39] With other words, the father is looking
[1:23:44] for dwelling places
[1:23:47] that he can live in.
[1:23:51] You understand that Satan on the same
[1:23:54] way?
[1:23:56] Do you know that a demon is powerless
[1:24:01] unless he has a body that he can use?
[1:24:08] Is that right? Remember remember when
[1:24:12] when when Jesus came to those demons
[1:24:17] and they said, "Okay, if you cast us
[1:24:19] out, if you cast us out, allow us to go
[1:24:23] into strength.
[1:24:25] Because without a body,
[1:24:28] they were powerless.
[1:24:32] And even the And even the swines,
[1:24:36] they they was running in the water
[1:24:39] because they they didn't want to be the
[1:24:42] dwelling place of demons.
[1:24:45] even demons,
[1:24:48] even the swines,
[1:24:50] they would run into the water
[1:24:53] because they didn't want to be dwelling
[1:24:54] places of demons.
[1:24:58] What about us,
[1:25:00] we should run into the water to be
[1:25:03] baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[1:25:06] because we don't want to be dwelling
[1:25:08] place of Satan.
[1:25:10] You understand that?
[1:25:13] You understand that?
[1:25:16] We should have a little bit more brain
[1:25:18] than pigs.
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:25] Remember when pigs
[1:25:28] they saw that demons wanted to come.
[1:25:32] They say no. We rather take our lives
[1:25:36] than to be possessed by demons.
[1:25:45] I tell I tell you a true story.
[1:25:49] It happened in our farm many years ago.
[1:25:53] I was still a young boy
[1:25:56] and my parents had hosted meetings in
[1:25:58] our farm
[1:26:02] and it was powerful meetings
[1:26:05] where the Holy Spirit really was falling
[1:26:06] on people.
[1:26:09] That means evil spirits were leaving
[1:26:11] people.
[1:26:14] And after a powerful and a really
[1:26:16] amazing meeting one evening,
[1:26:20] my father was not a ministry, he was a
[1:26:22] farmer.
[1:26:25] My father had pigs and cows and and
[1:26:27] everything.
[1:26:30] So after really a meeting
[1:26:33] where where uh devils uh was cast out by
[1:26:36] the word,
[1:26:39] you know, preaching the word
[1:26:41] is casting out devils.
[1:26:46] As the word is being preached this
[1:26:48] morning,
[1:26:50] it can cast out devils.
[1:26:54] And as the word was preached
[1:26:57] and demons were cast out,
[1:27:00] my father, he was a farmer.
[1:27:03] And after the service, he went into to
[1:27:05] feed the pigs.
[1:27:07] He wanted to go where the pigs are and
[1:27:09] to give them food.
[1:27:11] And he said he came into the pig hole
[1:27:15] and the pigs were standing at the wall.
[1:27:21] He said, "What is going on here?
[1:27:25] The pigs were standing at the wall
[1:27:28] because they didn't want those demons.
[1:27:35] My father was shocked.
[1:27:38] But then he they I believe he remembered
[1:27:40] the scripture.
[1:27:42] He said when those demons was cast out
[1:27:46] and they wanted to go into the swine,
[1:27:49] but even the swine had enough brain
[1:27:52] not to be a dwelling place of demons.
[1:27:56] And we should have enough brain this
[1:27:58] morning
[1:27:59] not to stay a dwelling place of Satan,
[1:28:03] but to become a dwelling place of
[1:28:05] Almighty God.
[1:28:07] A dwelling place where Almighty God can
[1:28:09] live. We should have enough brain this
[1:28:12] morning
[1:28:14] not to worship the beast,
[1:28:16] but we should have enough brain this
[1:28:18] morning
[1:28:20] to worship the one and only living God
[1:28:23] and his name is Jesus Christ.
[1:28:26] To worship him and him alone.
[1:28:30] How do you worship Jesus Christ today?
[1:28:33] By giving yourself to you
[1:28:36] so that he can use you.
[1:28:39] That is a worship that God's desire.
[1:28:43] God don't need your money.
[1:28:46] He has enough.
[1:28:49] Amen.
[1:28:52] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's good to
[1:28:57] give money
[1:28:59] for the kingdom that everything works,
[1:29:03] but God don't need your money.
[1:29:07] Amen.
[1:29:08] Amen. Amen. What God needs, he needs
[1:29:13] you.
[1:29:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:18] Without you,
[1:29:20] God cannot be completed.
[1:29:25] If you can believe that you're a part of
[1:29:27] God.
[1:29:29] Amen. Then God needs you here.
[1:29:32] God needs you here to be completed.
[1:29:37] That's why Jesus was telling the woman
[1:29:38] at the well,
[1:29:40] the father seekers worshiper.
[1:29:44] The father is looking for worship.
[1:29:49] What about the world today?
[1:29:52] Can he find worshipper?
[1:29:55] Can he find worshipper?
[1:29:58] When you ask people,
[1:30:00] "What are you? I'm a Methodist. I'm a
[1:30:03] Baptist.
[1:30:09] That means
[1:30:11] you're telling God,
[1:30:14] I am occupied already.
[1:30:24] Amen.
[1:30:26] Amen. Amen. Look the woman at the well.
[1:30:29] What Jesus had to do, he had to set her
[1:30:32] free
[1:30:34] from everything
[1:30:36] and then he could be manifested in us.
[1:30:40] And this is what God is looking for this
[1:30:42] morning
[1:30:44] while the whole world is worshiping
[1:30:45] Satan.
[1:30:48] We should we should worship the only
[1:30:50] living God.
[1:30:52] And how do you worship him? Maybe you
[1:30:55] cannot sing. Maybe you cannot sing.
[1:30:59] Maybe you cannot dance but you can
[1:31:01] worship him and giving your life to him.
[1:31:07] It's so simple.
[1:31:09] So simple.
[1:31:10] Every day
[1:31:12] the everyday life
[1:31:15] it becomes so simple
[1:31:21] as we see it with Abraham.
[1:31:25] But really we want to go to see Jesus
[1:31:27] Christ the same
[1:31:30] and uh and we understand
[1:31:34] as brother Brandham would take that
[1:31:36] scripture
[1:31:39] Hebrews 13:8
[1:31:43] if you read it
[1:31:46] I don't know
[1:31:48] when you read it
[1:31:52] this sentence
[1:31:54] cannot stand alone.
[1:32:00] You understand that
[1:32:04] this sentence
[1:32:06] does not stand alone.
[1:32:10] This sentence
[1:32:12] is a result.
[1:32:18] I want you to be very careful.
[1:32:21] Many times we quote that so easy
[1:32:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:32:29] but we don't know what is surrounding it
[1:32:34] what makes Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:39] you understand this is just a sentence
[1:32:44] that shows this is the result
[1:32:48] as I'm doing a sentence
[1:32:51] Amen. Amen. And when I say this glass of
[1:32:55] water was good,
[1:32:59] then you know a few things. Then you
[1:33:02] know a few things.
[1:33:04] You know I was thirsty.
[1:33:10] Okay. Let's let's let's make it very
[1:33:12] simple.
[1:33:14] If we had a glass of water here
[1:33:18] and don't bring it. No, James says fine,
[1:33:19] fine. I don't need
[1:33:21] but you understand
[1:33:26] if I say
[1:33:29] this glass of water
[1:33:32] was good.
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:37] That sentence
[1:33:39] doesn't stand alone.
[1:33:43] You're with me?
[1:33:46] Okay. Oh, yeah. Here. Let's bring the
[1:33:48] bottle.
[1:33:51] Okay. Okay.
[1:33:54] Now, now I say
[1:33:57] this is good.
[1:34:02] He can say
[1:34:04] it was good.
[1:34:08] So you understand just to make it plain
[1:34:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:34:14] and forever.
[1:34:16] It's not a sentence that stands alone.
[1:34:20] If I tell you this bottle of water was
[1:34:25] very good,
[1:34:27] that means I was thirsty.
[1:34:31] That means I have tasted it.
[1:34:35] That means I have drunken it.
[1:34:39] Then I can say this water was good.
[1:34:46] So if you see Jesus Christ the same
[1:34:49] yesterday, today and forever
[1:34:51] that sentence is not alone.
[1:34:56] Amen.
[1:34:59] Hallelujah. Many times it becomes just
[1:35:02] like a a a slogan. We say a slogan.
[1:35:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:35:14] and forever.
[1:35:16] For example,
[1:35:18] when we see a healing, when we see
[1:35:20] healing,
[1:35:21] we say Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:35:24] today and forever.
[1:35:27] I want you to be very careful.
[1:35:30] There's people today on earth and I
[1:35:33] trust you are some of them
[1:35:36] that makes Jesus Christ the same today.
[1:35:41] Amen.
[1:35:42] [Applause]
[1:35:45] Don't let it become just our religious
[1:35:47] slogan.
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:52] Let it become your life
[1:35:55] to say this water was good.
[1:36:00] There was a need for me to drink it.
[1:36:03] Otherwise, I cannot say it's good.
[1:36:07] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[1:36:11] for Jesus Christ to be the same
[1:36:14] today, you need to do something.
[1:36:19] That sentence,
[1:36:21] that sentence is not standing on his
[1:36:24] own.
[1:36:25] That sentence is brought there because
[1:36:29] you are here. You make him the same
[1:36:33] today.
[1:36:34] Your presence,
[1:36:36] your availability
[1:36:39] makes Jesus Christ.
[1:36:41] the same today.
[1:36:43] [Applause]
[1:36:45] Hallelujah.
[1:36:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ the
[1:36:53] same.
[1:36:55] It's not a repetition.
[1:37:01] Yes, sir.
[1:37:03] Jesus Christ the same today.
[1:37:06] It's not a repetition.
[1:37:09] That's why when we look back
[1:37:12] to Jesus Christ yesterday,
[1:37:15] you know about Enoch,
[1:37:18] something very strange about Enoch.
[1:37:22] Why is there so few things written about
[1:37:24] him?
[1:37:29] Enoch was the seventh from Adam.
[1:37:34] We are the seventh from the second Adam.
[1:37:39] I want to repeat,
[1:37:41] Enoch was the seventh
[1:37:45] from the first Adam.
[1:37:49] We are the sevenths
[1:37:52] from the second Adam.
[1:37:57] Is that right? Can we say praise the
[1:38:00] Lord?
[1:38:02] Identify yourself
[1:38:04] in the scripture.
[1:38:06] Jesus could identify himself.
[1:38:10] That was his security.
[1:38:12] That was his power. That was his
[1:38:15] strength
[1:38:16] that he could say, "It is written about
[1:38:19] me."
[1:38:21] When Satan would throw the word at him,
[1:38:25] what do you do when Satan throws the
[1:38:30] truth at you?
[1:38:37] Uhhuh.
[1:38:41] Satan said to Jesus,
[1:38:43] "It is written."
[1:38:47] And it was the truth.
[1:38:50] So Satan was throwing
[1:38:54] the truth at Jesus.
[1:38:56] What are you doing when Satan is
[1:39:00] throwing the truth at you?
[1:39:07] Look in the denomination.
[1:39:09] How many people take the Bible and throw
[1:39:13] the truth?
[1:39:15] You must be baptized
[1:39:18] in the name
[1:39:20] of father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:24] Amen. Is that the truth? Amen. Is that
[1:39:28] what Jesus said?
[1:39:31] Is that what he said?
[1:39:34] He said, "Go in all the world,
[1:39:37] baptize them in the name of the Father,
[1:39:40] in the name of the Son, the name of the
[1:39:42] Holy Ghost." Is that the truth? Yes.
[1:39:47] What do you do? And Satan throws the
[1:39:49] truth at you.
[1:39:59] Hallelujah. You understand how important
[1:40:03] that is that we have a relationship with
[1:40:06] God
[1:40:08] so that he can unveil himself
[1:40:11] and the prophet came to restore
[1:40:15] a relationship
[1:40:18] between God and man.
[1:40:20] What did Jesus do after Satan
[1:40:24] throw the truths at him? He said it is
[1:40:27] written. He said, "Yes, it's written,
[1:40:31] but it is also written."
[1:40:35] He gave him the message
[1:40:39] of the hour.
[1:40:42] Hallelujah.
[1:40:46] You can follow.
[1:40:48] It's right. It's right. But now the
[1:40:51] truth came that the name of the father,
[1:40:55] the name of the son, the name of the
[1:40:58] holy ghost is Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:41:01] That's why when Peter came.
[1:41:04] That's why when Peter came
[1:41:07] exactly what Jesus said
[1:41:10] but more defined,
[1:41:13] more plain,
[1:41:15] more revealed.
[1:41:19] Amen. Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. So we speaking of
[1:41:27] Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:32] today.
[1:41:33] Amen. Hallelujah. You we have to
[1:41:36] understand
[1:41:37] Jesus. If you see Jesus Christ yesterday
[1:41:41] in the life of Abraham,
[1:41:44] we have to understand as a royal seed of
[1:41:47] Abraham
[1:41:49] that we are not copying Abraham.
[1:41:53] As I as I spoke about Enoch,
[1:41:56] if you read, what do you know about
[1:41:58] Enoch?
[1:42:00] We don't read much about him.
[1:42:02] We just read about him that he pleased
[1:42:06] God.
[1:42:07] He pleased God.
[1:42:10] Pleased God means adoption.
[1:42:14] So he walked into his adoption,
[1:42:18] you can please God,
[1:42:21] if you walk into your adoption,
[1:42:24] that's why God said this is my beloved
[1:42:27] son.
[1:42:29] Not only born not only born
[1:42:33] but this is my beloved son
[1:42:36] in whom I'm well pleased please pleased
[1:42:38] to dwell.
[1:42:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. What about
[1:42:45] quickly? We only strike it quickly
[1:42:48] because we want to really to go to Jesus
[1:42:50] Christ the same today.
[1:42:53] But we want to see Jesus Christ the same
[1:42:58] yesterday.
[1:42:59] so that we can under understand
[1:43:03] principles.
[1:43:08] Amen. Remember
[1:43:10] we can if you understand the principles
[1:43:13] of the Bible
[1:43:16] the principles that is there
[1:43:19] it will help you to identify
[1:43:24] God in your own life.
[1:43:28] Amen.
[1:43:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So
[1:43:32] as we speak of Abraham,
[1:43:35] as we speak about Enoch,
[1:43:38] and to me when I was a young Christian,
[1:43:41] I always felt
[1:43:43] Lord, if I just knew a little bit more
[1:43:46] about Enoch,
[1:43:48] it would be nice for me.
[1:43:51] I know he pleased God so that I could do
[1:43:55] what he did.
[1:43:57] And I know I please you,
[1:44:00] right? That's many times how we look at
[1:44:04] one another.
[1:44:07] We look at brother Steven
[1:44:09] and then you see his godly life
[1:44:13] and then then you then you want to copy
[1:44:15] it.
[1:44:17] You want to some people want to become
[1:44:19] like brother Steven.
[1:44:21] Some people want to become like brother
[1:44:22] Samson
[1:44:24] because he sees such a godly life in
[1:44:26] him.
[1:44:27] But you understand you are not brother
[1:44:30] Steven. You are not brother Samson. I'm
[1:44:34] not brother Steven. I'm not brother
[1:44:36] Samson. I have to be what I am.
[1:44:40] You have to be what you are.
[1:44:45] Hallelujah. You understand that? So what
[1:44:48] we have to see? We have to see the
[1:44:51] principles.
[1:44:53] We have to see the nature.
[1:44:56] That is not changing.
[1:44:59] God is an unchanging God.
[1:45:02] He cannot change his nature.
[1:45:06] But he changed his appearing many times.
[1:45:11] You understand that?
[1:45:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:16] Amen. So I believe that's why there's so
[1:45:19] little written about Enoch.
[1:45:23] What do you know about him?
[1:45:26] We know he he he just made the pyramids
[1:45:28] supposed to be.
[1:45:33] Is it right?
[1:45:35] He should be the one that was
[1:45:38] responsible for the great pyramid.
[1:45:42] You have heard about the great pyramid.
[1:45:45] The great pyramid.
[1:45:47] It's there. I think it's around if it's
[1:45:49] in Egypt somewhere.
[1:45:52] But it's there without a capping.
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:59] Amen. Why? Because Enoch understood
[1:46:05] that capstone.
[1:46:07] The capstone
[1:46:09] would be come down in this hour that we
[1:46:13] are living in.
[1:46:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see Enoch,
[1:46:21] I want to be very very careful with you.
[1:46:24] We don't know much about Enoch.
[1:46:28] You know why that is very good
[1:46:31] that we don't copy him?
[1:46:37] You understand?
[1:46:38] Many people see Jesus Christ the same.
[1:46:44] They try to copy one another.
[1:46:47] Oh yeah.
[1:46:50] Mhm. Mhm. But Jesus Christ the same
[1:46:54] doesn't mean you copy anyone.
[1:47:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand?
[1:47:06] You read your Bible
[1:47:09] and you read all the examples
[1:47:12] where you can see Jesus Christ yesterday
[1:47:16] and you don't try to copy them today.
[1:47:20] You know why not? It will not work.
[1:47:30] Come on church. Remember in the time of
[1:47:33] brother Brham,
[1:47:35] he had a group of people around him
[1:47:39] that was reading the book of Acts
[1:47:43] where the believers had all in common.
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:49] He said the first church,
[1:47:52] the first believers,
[1:47:54] they had all in common.
[1:47:58] one big group of people.
[1:48:03] Very important to understand that you
[1:48:06] understand that was book of acts.
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] Is it correct?
[1:48:12] They was even having breaking of the
[1:48:14] bread
[1:48:17] daily.
[1:48:22] Is that correct?
[1:48:24] And they had all in common.
[1:48:28] They sh they shared the money.
[1:48:35] And in the time of brother Brham, there
[1:48:37] was a group of people.
[1:48:40] They tried to copy that.
[1:48:43] And somewhere in United States,
[1:48:46] they wanted to make a nice place
[1:48:50] as they had it in the book of Acts.
[1:48:54] You know why? They wanted to do it the
[1:48:57] same way.
[1:48:59] And they felt And they felt
[1:49:04] if we if we if we do it like they
[1:49:07] God will bless us like God bless you.
[1:49:13] Can I say something?
[1:49:17] A trap of the devil.
[1:49:23] A trap of the devil.
[1:49:27] That's right.
[1:49:30] Uh-huh. Mhm. Remember,
[1:49:33] it was Satan
[1:49:36] telling to Jesus,
[1:49:39] "If you do this, if you speak and do
[1:49:43] this, this will happen."
[1:49:47] You know what Jesus said? That is true.
[1:49:51] That was the word
[1:49:54] for that day.
[1:49:56] But don't try to copy me
[1:50:00] because I am the word for this day.
[1:50:06] Hallelujah. Can we understand the
[1:50:08] principle?
[1:50:13] It's so important.
[1:50:16] Paul said, "You follow me.
[1:50:20] as I follow Christ.
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:25] Paul had a great encounter
[1:50:30] when he was when he was on the road
[1:50:34] to Damascus.
[1:50:36] Is that right? He had a great encounter.
[1:50:42] Amen. A light strike came down.
[1:50:47] You understand? You with me? Amen.
[1:50:50] And he was well taught in the Bible.
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:56] I think he was taught under one of the
[1:50:57] greatest teachers at that time.
[1:51:01] So he knew the light
[1:51:03] that is the Lord.
[1:51:06] That's why he said Lord who are you?
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:11] You know what the the the light said
[1:51:14] back?
[1:51:15] said I am Jesus. Listen.
[1:51:22] Whom thou persecutest.
[1:51:27] Who was Paul persecuting?
[1:51:30] Jesus was not alive anymore.
[1:51:36] Jesus was not alive anymore. Is that
[1:51:38] right? Come on, church.
[1:51:41] Jesus went to glory.
[1:51:46] Amen.
[1:51:49] So whom he was persecuted
[1:51:51] and the voice said now Paul was confused
[1:51:57] he know the voice is God
[1:52:01] that's why he said Lord who are you said
[1:52:04] I am Jesus
[1:52:10] and in Paul's mind
[1:52:14] he saw the picture of Jesus
[1:52:24] that you are persecuting.
[1:52:27] Amen.
[1:52:32] No, I'm not persecuting him.
[1:52:36] He's not alive at all.
[1:52:40] No.
[1:52:42] God would say, "You're persecuting him.
[1:52:47] in bride form. Now
[1:52:53] you understand
[1:52:55] come on church and you think of Jesus
[1:52:57] Christ the same.
[1:52:59] He's not a copy.
[1:53:02] He's not a past tense God.
[1:53:06] He's a present help
[1:53:09] in time of trouble.
[1:53:12] You catch that. You understand Paul? how
[1:53:14] confused he was
[1:53:17] because he didn't see the principle
[1:53:21] of Jesus Christ the same
[1:53:25] yesterday
[1:53:27] today and forever.
[1:53:30] Paul
[1:53:31] stuck
[1:53:34] stuck
[1:53:37] in Jesus Christ yesterday.
[1:53:44] But God told him, "No, no, no, no. It's
[1:53:46] not Jesus Christ yesterday."
[1:53:49] The the the bride is Jesus Christ
[1:53:55] today.
[1:53:58] You understand that? Can we say praise
[1:54:01] the Lord?
[1:54:03] So God is waiting for you.
[1:54:06] God is not waiting for William Brandham
[1:54:07] to come back.
[1:54:11] God is not waiting for Jesus Christ.
[1:54:14] God is waiting for you
[1:54:16] because you make him. You have the
[1:54:19] potential
[1:54:21] to make Jesus Christ the same today.
[1:54:26] Can you say praise the Lord?
[1:54:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe
[1:54:31] what God said about the first church?
[1:54:37] Amen. Now Paul had to believe
[1:54:41] in order to believe.
[1:54:45] He had to believe
[1:54:47] what the Lord said
[1:54:49] what God said who Jesus Christ is.
[1:54:54] I ask you a question.
[1:54:56] Do you believe
[1:54:58] what God in this hour
[1:55:01] said who Jesus Christ is?
[1:55:09] Do we believe
[1:55:12] it took Paul a long time
[1:55:16] to see his great error?
[1:55:20] He searched the scriptures
[1:55:23] and he saw the tides and shadows
[1:55:26] and then he understood
[1:55:29] the three years in the Arabian desert
[1:55:34] and showed him how wrong he was
[1:55:39] because he didn't see Jesus Christ. He
[1:55:42] even was persecuting
[1:55:46] Jesus Christ.
[1:55:50] Hallelujah.
[1:55:56] Now I think we are warm.
[1:56:01] The angel now is warm.
[1:56:05] Now let's move.
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:10] We have the saying in cold Germany.
[1:56:16] And this world is spiritually very cold.
[1:56:20] That's why you should come early to
[1:56:21] church.
[1:56:24] Is that right? Why do we come early to
[1:56:26] church?
[1:56:28] Why do we pray? Why do we sing songs
[1:56:33] to warm up? Yes.
[1:56:37] Come once to Germany.
[1:56:40] Brother Steven was there. But we are in
[1:56:43] our winter time. He is not leaving the
[1:56:46] room and the car
[1:56:49] because it's too cold outside.
[1:56:53] And you know what we do in winter time?
[1:56:57] We start our engines of the car
[1:57:01] and we let it run for a couple of
[1:57:03] minutes
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:06] till the engine becomes warm
[1:57:10] and then we can go. And I believe this
[1:57:13] morning
[1:57:14] The engine is warm now.
[1:57:18] Okay, then let's go. Okay, then let's
[1:57:20] move now.
[1:57:24] Let's move now. Is it okay?
[1:57:28] Let's put the first gear in.
[1:57:31] That's why we started the car at all. We
[1:57:34] don't start the car to go backwards.
[1:57:38] We start the car to go forward.
[1:57:41] Now, now let's let's move together
[1:57:43] forward.
[1:57:45] Are you ready for it? Do you believe
[1:57:48] him? Because it will be so simple.
[1:57:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's move.
[1:57:54] Brother is shouting to the people. He
[1:57:57] said, "Don't be like Israel."
[1:58:00] Or he said, "Be like Israel."
[1:58:03] When Israel was moving in the wilderness
[1:58:07] and even when they when they settled
[1:58:09] down, the Holy Spirit was settling down,
[1:58:13] they quickly put up their tents.
[1:58:16] A tabernacle in the wilderness.
[1:58:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you a
[1:58:21] tabernacle in this wilderness?
[1:58:28] Are we in the wilderness? Are we in the
[1:58:31] wilderness?
[1:58:33] Yes, we are in the wilderness.
[1:58:35] We are not in Egypt anymore.
[1:58:38] We are not what we were
[1:58:41] in Satan's Eden
[1:58:43] in Laia. We are like in the wilderness.
[1:58:47] Here we are pilgrims and strangers.
[1:58:50] Come on church.
[1:58:53] And you know what Israel should do? When
[1:58:56] the Holy Spirit settling down the
[1:58:58] church,
[1:58:59] can you understand how the Holy Spirit
[1:59:01] many times is settling down?
[1:59:06] Be established.
[1:59:08] Be established in this truth.
[1:59:11] Be established.
[1:59:13] Be established in the water baptism.
[1:59:15] Settling down.
[1:59:18] Come. Be established in the Godhead.
[1:59:21] Be established in water baptism.
[1:59:25] Is that not right? It looks like the
[1:59:27] Holy Spirit just coming and stops that
[1:59:29] way. Let's put our tents down here for a
[1:59:33] moment
[1:59:34] and let's settle down. You need to be
[1:59:37] baptized
[1:59:39] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:42] Settle them down. When that is settled,
[1:59:46] the Holy Spirit's moving up again
[1:59:49] because we are going forward,
[1:59:52] not backwards. And watch watch what
[1:59:54] brother Ranom says
[1:59:57] when the Holy Spirit settled down.
[1:59:59] Remember they had to put their own tents
[2:00:03] and also the tabernacle of the
[2:00:05] wilderness.
[2:00:08] Uhhuh.
[2:00:10] It was it was it was not Solomon's
[2:00:13] temple.
[2:00:16] That was not easy to to build it up and
[2:00:19] move.
[2:00:23] That's why they had in the in the desert
[2:00:27] they had a portable they had a portable
[2:00:30] tabernacle.
[2:00:35] You understand that?
[2:00:38] Come on church. It was in the same
[2:00:40] fashion
[2:00:42] as later the temple of Solomon.
[2:00:47] But it was made
[2:00:50] for the purpose.
[2:00:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you are made
[2:00:56] for this purpose.
[2:00:58] To live in Satan's Eden to live in
[2:01:01] Satan's Eden.
[2:01:04] To be in Laia
[2:01:07] and yet to move to the promised land.
[2:01:10] The promised land in this case is the
[2:01:13] millennium.
[2:01:15] Is that okay?
[2:01:18] Do we understand that?
[2:01:20] Now watch Adam said they should not put
[2:01:23] their sticks too deep down.
[2:01:30] How many times we have put the sticks so
[2:01:33] deep down
[2:01:40] that you have become a denomination.
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:48] That's that's a denomination.
[2:01:51] They take the truth,
[2:01:54] reveal truth
[2:01:56] and put it deep down
[2:01:58] and they said we believe it. We never
[2:02:01] move from here
[2:02:05] and it becomes a denomination.
[2:02:08] You know when it becomes a denomination?
[2:02:10] When God is moving,
[2:02:13] when God is showing more truth,
[2:02:17] You know why they are denomination
[2:02:20] bound themselves down?
[2:02:26] So even in the message don't bind
[2:02:29] yourself down
[2:02:32] even with this message.
[2:02:34] Don't bind yourself down
[2:02:37] to God send a prophet.
[2:02:41] Don't bind yourself down
[2:02:44] to God sent a prophet.
[2:02:46] You die as a denomination
[2:02:51] because when God sends a prophet,
[2:02:54] there's a reason for him to send a
[2:02:55] prophet.
[2:02:59] And this is where the Holy Spirit
[2:03:02] wants to take us to now.
[2:03:05] We believe God sent the prophets.
[2:03:08] Now we want to move
[2:03:10] to the purpose
[2:03:12] for why God sent one.
[2:03:18] Why? Why did Abraham
[2:03:22] send Eleazar?
[2:03:31] You're all Bible readers.
[2:03:34] Why did
[2:03:36] Abraham the father
[2:03:40] Uhhuh.
[2:03:43] not Isaac
[2:03:46] the son.
[2:03:48] It was Abraham the father.
[2:03:53] Is it not amazing? Is it not amazing?
[2:03:59] Is what? It was not Isaac
[2:04:01] telling to Eleazar. You know what? I
[2:04:04] think I need a wife.
[2:04:09] No, no, no. It was not Jesus Christ.
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:16] The Bible said, "Behold, I
[2:04:21] God himself
[2:04:24] 4, behold, I
[2:04:27] will send unto you Elijah the prophet."
[2:04:32] Who is that?
[2:04:33] God himself.
[2:04:37] Hallelujah.
[2:04:38] Is that right? Come on, church.
[2:04:42] Take go to Bible principles.
[2:04:45] It was the father
[2:04:47] looking for a wife
[2:04:50] for his son.
[2:04:52] It was the father.
[2:04:55] It was God. It was God himself
[2:04:59] sending Malachi 4.
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:03] Hallelujah. And when Eleazar was sent
[2:05:06] out,
[2:05:08] what did Abraham told him?
[2:05:11] There was a purpose
[2:05:13] for him to go.
[2:05:15] [Music]
[2:05:19] That purpose of Eleazar
[2:05:22] was not to find followers of him.
[2:05:27] The purpose of Eleazar
[2:05:29] was not
[2:05:31] to to have followers.
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:38] Do you know
[2:05:40] John the Baptist
[2:05:42] got followers
[2:05:46] called the disciples of John?
[2:05:54] But John was not sent
[2:05:57] to make disciples after him.
[2:06:03] Elaza was not sent
[2:06:06] to make little Ilazas after him.
[2:06:11] Brother Brandham was not sent
[2:06:14] that we would follow him.
[2:06:17] Yes, we follow him but we follow him to
[2:06:21] find Christ.
[2:06:24] The main purpose
[2:06:26] of Eleazar
[2:06:28] was to bring the bride
[2:06:31] to Isaac.
[2:06:36] Come on, church. You understand that?
[2:06:39] Rebecca's purpose.
[2:06:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:47] Hallelujah. It's always the father.
[2:06:52] I have to I have to jump back.
[2:06:55] If you if you take the uh that principle
[2:06:58] there in Matthew 22
[2:07:02] where a king is making wedding for his
[2:07:06] son.
[2:07:11] It's not it's I think it's Matthew 22,
[2:07:13] right?
[2:07:16] A king is making wedding for his son.
[2:07:24] Don't have to read it.
[2:07:27] It was not the son
[2:07:30] making wedding for himself.
[2:07:33] It was the father
[2:07:36] making the wedding.
[2:07:38] Is that right? It was the father sending
[2:07:42] messengers out to get people in.
[2:07:47] Is that right?
[2:07:48] Amen. Amen. You see the principal
[2:07:51] church,
[2:07:54] it's the father.
[2:07:56] Jesus told the woman at the well,
[2:07:59] it is the father they're seeking for
[2:08:02] worship.
[2:08:04] Amen. You with me?
[2:08:08] So God
[2:08:10] is behind Malachi 4.
[2:08:13] God is behind sending a prophet.
[2:08:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when God
[2:08:19] sends a prophet,
[2:08:21] that prophet is not there alone.
[2:08:24] There is a purpose
[2:08:27] and a reason
[2:08:29] why God sends a prophet. And the purpose
[2:08:33] and the reason is a bride of Jesus
[2:08:35] Christ.
[2:08:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the message,
[2:08:40] hallelujah, the message came, all the
[2:08:43] truth came to wake up the bride.
[2:08:47] The truth of the message, the opening of
[2:08:50] the seals, the renting of the book
[2:08:56] was for the church to understand their
[2:08:59] position.
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:01] Remember
[2:09:03] that wonderful book
[2:09:06] that was closed in Revelations 5
[2:09:11] and John wept.
[2:09:13] That book was open
[2:09:15] and it is called a little book
[2:09:20] in Revelations 10.
[2:09:22] He said, "And I saw a little book
[2:09:27] open.
[2:09:29] Fear not little flock."
[2:09:34] Hallelujah. You understand? And I saw a
[2:09:37] little book open
[2:09:40] speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:44] And the same book. Come on church. The
[2:09:48] same book that was John was not worthy
[2:09:50] to look at.
[2:09:54] But when a bloody lamb had taken it. But
[2:09:57] when a bloody lamb had taken it
[2:10:02] because it was a bloody lamb
[2:10:05] that took the book out of the hands of
[2:10:08] the original owner
[2:10:11] paid the price.
[2:10:13] Can we say amen to that? Paid the price.
[2:10:16] So now the same book that John was not
[2:10:20] worthy to look at,
[2:10:23] he is commanded to eat the book.
[2:10:30] Now, where is the book now?
[2:10:33] Where is the book now?
[2:10:36] Where is the book now,
[2:10:39] church? Where is the book now?
[2:10:42] Can I ask you a question? Where is the
[2:10:43] book today?
[2:10:48] Have we eaten the book?
[2:10:52] Who has eaten the book?
[2:10:56] Hallelujah. Eating
[2:10:58] means
[2:11:00] to unite.
[2:11:03] Hallelujah. Remember in the garden of
[2:11:05] Eden
[2:11:07] they was eating from the tree.
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:12] What was that?
[2:11:15] A wrong union.
[2:11:18] And because of eating
[2:11:21] came the fall.
[2:11:25] Can we say praise the Lord because of
[2:11:28] eating in the garden came before
[2:11:32] we know today it was an affair.
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:38] Eating the book
[2:11:40] is an affair.
[2:11:43] It's a uniting.
[2:11:45] You become one
[2:11:47] with what God said about you.
[2:11:50] You believe what he speaks about you. So
[2:11:55] then who where's the book now?
[2:11:59] Where's the book now?
[2:12:03] Come on. Don't be shy.
[2:12:07] Where is the book now?
[2:12:15] Here.
[2:12:19] You can say here
[2:12:22] it's me.
[2:12:26] Hallelujah.
[2:12:28] Can you say that together?
[2:12:31] Where is the book now?
[2:12:33] Come on church.
[2:12:36] Hallelujah. Amen. As I said, okay, this
[2:12:41] was now first gear.
[2:12:45] Now let's go in the second one. Amen.
[2:12:47] [Music]
[2:12:49] Because the engine is warm.
[2:12:52] So let's drive.
[2:12:54] Let's move now.
[2:12:56] Is that okay? Amen. Everybody's
[2:12:59] comfortable.
[2:13:03] As we are going,
[2:13:06] you better fasten your seat belts.
[2:13:18] You don't need a seat. You don't need a
[2:13:20] seat belt
[2:13:22] when you are standing
[2:13:25] but you need a seat belt.
[2:13:27] You know when you're sitting in the
[2:13:28] plane
[2:13:30] as we are flying and the higher you fly
[2:13:35] sometimes some turbulences come
[2:13:38] and I tell you where we are on our way
[2:13:42] sometimes it becomes turbulence.
[2:13:45] This is so contrary.
[2:13:49] Satan is trying to shake the car,
[2:13:54] trying you to slow down.
[2:14:02] Okay, we are ready.
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:10] My
[2:14:12] allow me to give you out of the church
[2:14:15] age book
[2:14:19] to get very close to Hebrews 13:8
[2:14:25] and as I said that sentence
[2:14:30] when I say this water was good
[2:14:34] between the meetings I will drink it
[2:14:37] between the meetings
[2:14:39] I will empty the water
[2:14:42] when I come back to the second service.
[2:14:46] I will let you know that water was
[2:14:48] missed and then you know something has
[2:14:51] happened something has changed.
[2:14:56] So when it said he is the same
[2:14:58] yesterday, today and forever,
[2:15:02] it's a consequence
[2:15:05] of what is happening.
[2:15:08] You make Jesus Christ the same today.
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:12] The simple life that you live,
[2:15:16] the simple life that you live,
[2:15:18] don't try to be William Brandham.
[2:15:22] Don't try to be like the pastor.
[2:15:25] Don't try to be like brother Samson.
[2:15:27] Don't try to be like the one from
[2:15:29] Germany.
[2:15:31] When I say in my own church,
[2:15:34] I say don't try to be like me.
[2:15:38] One of me is more than enough.
[2:15:46] Is that okay?
[2:15:48] Amen.
[2:15:54] [Music]
[2:15:56] Hallelujah.
[2:16:02] As brother Brennan, brother Brennham
[2:16:06] came to the church eight messengers.
[2:16:14] Now remember,
[2:16:16] we have the church ages, right?
[2:16:19] We have the church ages.
[2:16:22] We have the church ages
[2:16:25] from Ephesus,
[2:16:27] Sina, Pergamon, Tatara, Zadis,
[2:16:33] Philadelphia, Philadelphia. And we are
[2:16:34] living
[2:16:36] in the last church age.
[2:16:39] It was also cities in minor Asia.
[2:16:44] Is that right? It was all cities in
[2:16:47] minor Asia.
[2:16:51] typing
[2:16:53] the church age that would come
[2:16:57] what characteristic it would be
[2:17:00] and remember what is loudia speaking of
[2:17:06] loudia speaks of people's rights
[2:17:11] are we not living in a time
[2:17:14] are we not living in a time when
[2:17:16] everyone is claiming his rights
[2:17:21] Is it not right? All the homosexuals
[2:17:24] claim their rights.
[2:17:27] All the total queer people claim their
[2:17:29] rights.
[2:17:34] They claim their right to be wrong.
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:44] They claim a right to be foolish.
[2:17:50] It's bad enough that they are foolish.
[2:17:54] It's bad enough that they are stupid,
[2:17:58] but now they claim the right to be
[2:18:00] stupid.
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:07] Is Is that not the time we're living in?
[2:18:13] Watch church very carefully.
[2:18:16] Everyone speaking of his rights.
[2:18:21] Nobody is interested in duties.
[2:18:29] Nobody
[2:18:31] interested in duties.
[2:18:35] You know we are suffering of a society
[2:18:40] where everyone
[2:18:42] is only thinking on his rights.
[2:18:48] Nobody
[2:18:50] is carrying any more of his duties.
[2:18:56] That is a characteristic of Laudisia.
[2:19:00] Yes sir. Oh my my my my my.
[2:19:04] Hallelujah. Not so the bride of Jesus
[2:19:07] Christ.
[2:19:11] We should understand our rights.
[2:19:14] We should understand our God-given
[2:19:17] rights.
[2:19:20] Is that right? But we should never
[2:19:24] forget as a prophet would say at the
[2:19:28] final stage
[2:19:31] you're not on the wings of a snow white
[2:19:33] dove.
[2:19:35] What is he saying? What is he saying? He
[2:19:38] said is a dove leading the eagle now.
[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:48] Come on, church.
[2:19:50] It's a dove
[2:19:53] leading the eagle.
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:19:57] You understand what a dove stands for?
[2:20:01] Yes, sir. Amen. A dove and a lamb, they
[2:20:03] go together. They have the same nature.
[2:20:07] They have the same nature.
[2:20:09] And we understand what a lamb is doing.
[2:20:14] A lamb is giving away his rights.
[2:20:19] Amen. That's right.
[2:20:25] Oh my. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Is it
[2:20:28] okay?
[2:20:30] We go now in the third gear.
[2:20:36] Okay. We will get faster.
[2:20:39] And I trust you have your seat belts on.
[2:20:43] Maybe get turbulence.
[2:20:48] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:20:55] It's a age that we are living in.
[2:21:00] My goodness.
[2:21:02] Allow me to read to you something.
[2:21:06] I have taken that
[2:21:09] from
[2:21:11] this is um
[2:21:15] this is a a drawing
[2:21:19] some
[2:21:21] a professor of a university
[2:21:25] a university for politics.
[2:21:31] How to run a country?
[2:21:37] Not a believer.
[2:21:39] Not a believer.
[2:21:41] Just a normal professor
[2:21:46] would make would make a pamphlet
[2:21:50] for his students
[2:21:53] as a foundation.
[2:21:56] You understand that? Yes sir. I trust I
[2:22:00] can read it.
[2:22:03] It's very interesting
[2:22:05] speaking of the day that we are living
[2:22:07] in
[2:22:09] and hold fast be we are going quickly
[2:22:13] because we want to see how it fits
[2:22:16] perfectly
[2:22:19] with what God is doing in this day.
[2:22:24] Listen very carefully.
[2:22:26] So this is a professor
[2:22:29] for for political students,
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:33] principles
[2:22:35] how to run a country
[2:22:40] and what happened
[2:22:42] in our day.
[2:22:44] Listen, it's not a believer,
[2:22:46] but to me it was striking.
[2:22:50] You ready?
[2:22:52] The affirmation of rights.
[2:22:57] And the denial of duties
[2:23:01] is one of the fundamental contradictions
[2:23:03] in human life.
[2:23:07] Of course,
[2:23:09] it is more comfortable the way of life
[2:23:11] to take more than to give.
[2:23:18] You know how Jesus said
[2:23:21] it's better to give
[2:23:31] Okay.
[2:23:32] It is easier, more comfortable
[2:23:36] to take more than to give.
[2:23:41] Assert rights comprehensively
[2:23:46] against others
[2:23:49] and to deny duty
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:53] towards others.
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:23:58] Listen
[2:24:00] what that man is saying.
[2:24:02] The aim of this module, the aim of this
[2:24:05] outcome
[2:24:08] is to make clear
[2:24:11] that in every society,
[2:24:15] every right
[2:24:17] necessarily
[2:24:20] needs a duty.
[2:24:27] and rights
[2:24:29] can only be successfully exercised
[2:24:35] if duties are recognized at the same
[2:24:38] time.
[2:24:41] Listen what that man is saying in the
[2:24:44] past two decades.
[2:24:47] The sense of duty
[2:24:50] has sometimes been mostly classified
[2:24:56] as mere a secondary virtue.
[2:24:59] [Music]
[2:25:02] However, if duties are no longer taken
[2:25:06] seriously,
[2:25:08] rights will sooner or later come to
[2:25:11] nothing. My goodness.
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:18] Can I say something church?
[2:25:21] Our rights
[2:25:23] that we have
[2:25:25] become powerless
[2:25:31] if we neglect
[2:25:35] our simple duty.
[2:25:39] That's why you can see in the life of
[2:25:40] Abraham
[2:25:43] it said after these things
[2:25:46] the Lord came back to him after these
[2:25:49] things
[2:25:52] after what things
[2:25:54] after Abraham
[2:25:56] had done his normal duties.
[2:25:58] [Music]
[2:26:07] Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:26:10] Look how that man is saying that.
[2:26:13] However, if duties are no longer taken
[2:26:16] seriously,
[2:26:19] rights will sooner or later come to an
[2:26:21] effect.
[2:26:24] This would ultimately result
[2:26:28] in a loss of personal freedom
[2:26:33] and social justice in society.
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:42] Yes, that is correct. Is it not? So
[2:26:45] that is true. You see when the in the
[2:26:47] world
[2:26:49] everyone is thinking on his rights
[2:26:58] now is it okay?
[2:27:01] Now we go to gear four.
[2:27:08] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[2:27:11] at the end of the day,
[2:27:13] we end of gear five.
[2:27:17] You will see
[2:27:20] it's all grace from the beginning.
[2:27:24] Now let's very quickly we have to as we
[2:27:28] speak of duties
[2:27:31] we have to understand
[2:27:33] that the covenant
[2:27:35] that the covenant
[2:27:38] that the covenant of Abraham
[2:27:41] is unconditionally.
[2:27:44] Amen. To understand duties
[2:27:49] in the right way,
[2:27:51] we have to understand that the covenant
[2:27:55] is unconditionally.
[2:28:02] And allow me to add to my title.
[2:28:07] It's Jesus Christ the same today
[2:28:12] by unconditional duties.
[2:28:24] Amen. Now we start.
[2:28:32] Hallelujah.
[2:28:34] Isn't it amazing?
[2:28:38] We see it in the life of Abraham
[2:28:41] how Jesus Christ was there yesterday.
[2:28:46] the same
[2:28:48] how he lived in Abraham.
[2:28:52] Come on. Jesus Christ was not even born.
[2:28:58] Is it correct? But who was that
[2:29:02] in Genesis 19
[2:29:05] spoke to God himself?
[2:29:08] Who was that
[2:29:10] that said, God, if there's 50 righteous
[2:29:15] would you destroy Sodom?
[2:29:17] And God said, if I find 50, I don't
[2:29:20] destroy. Then Abraham said, Lord, if
[2:29:23] there's only 40,
[2:29:25] God said, if there's 40, who was that?
[2:29:30] Who was that trying to negotiate with
[2:29:34] God?
[2:29:36] Who can talk to God like that?
[2:29:39] Who can talk to God like that?
[2:29:42] Only Jesus Christ.
[2:29:45] Amen.
[2:29:47] So we understand that was Jesus Christ
[2:29:51] through Abraham.
[2:29:54] Amen.
[2:29:56] Is it today?
[2:29:58] Jesus Christ through the church.
[2:30:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:30:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:30:08] Hallelujah. How simple.
[2:30:12] What did Abraham do?
[2:30:14] Because the covenant was unconditional.
[2:30:17] Is it right? The covenant was
[2:30:19] unconditional.
[2:30:21] Can we say that together?
[2:30:24] Unconditionally.
[2:30:27] So your duties
[2:30:30] are not a condition.
[2:30:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:30:40] your duties.
[2:30:44] You don't It's not if you do that you go
[2:30:47] to heaven.
[2:30:49] No, you do that because you understood
[2:30:52] your position.
[2:30:55] You do that because you know who you
[2:30:57] are.
[2:31:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:31:07] Oh, it's my duty to love him.
[2:31:11] Amen.
[2:31:13] Amen.
[2:31:15] Can I make it clearer?
[2:31:17] It's my duty to love him.
[2:31:20] You know why? Because I know who I am.
[2:31:25] I know I'm the part of the bride of
[2:31:27] Jesus Christ.
[2:31:29] And as a bride of Jesus Christ, you have
[2:31:31] to love him. So it is my duty
[2:31:36] to love him. And because I love him, I
[2:31:40] know that he loves me because I cannot
[2:31:44] love him without he first loving me. Do
[2:31:48] you love him who loves him this morning?
[2:31:52] Then you are sure that he loves you
[2:31:56] because you cannot love him without him
[2:31:59] loving you. He loved you first
[2:32:03] and purchased your salvation.
[2:32:06] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. You
[2:32:09] understand that?
[2:32:11] But as a wife
[2:32:13] it is it is my duty to love him.
[2:32:21] Is it okay when we speak of duties?
[2:32:27] Amen. But today nobody wants duties.
[2:32:34] Because too too many too many times the
[2:32:37] devil tells us duties are conditions.
[2:32:45] Too many times the devil tried to tell
[2:32:48] us duties are conditions.
[2:32:52] So he tells you
[2:32:55] if you have to wear a long dress
[2:32:59] otherwise you go to hell.
[2:33:02] [Music]
[2:33:05] No, the long dress
[2:33:09] is not a condition.
[2:33:12] You understand that?
[2:33:16] Come on church.
[2:33:18] The devil is many times trying to tell
[2:33:22] you that a duty
[2:33:26] is a condition.
[2:33:28] But not so for Abraham.
[2:33:30] Come on, church. Not so for Abraham.
[2:33:33] Abraham had a covenant
[2:33:36] without condition.
[2:33:38] Can we say praise the Lord to that?
[2:33:41] Allow me for a few minutes.
[2:33:43] Maybe we have to skip it to the
[2:33:45] afternoon though.
[2:33:47] But it will be beautiful. I tell you,
[2:33:50] it's beautiful.
[2:33:52] How Jesus Christ was the same yesterday.
[2:33:56] Simple.
[2:33:58] Do you want to let Jesus Christ be the
[2:33:59] same today?
[2:34:03] What must I do, Lord?
[2:34:07] What miracle must I do?
[2:34:10] What magic must I do so that Jesus
[2:34:14] Christ is the same?
[2:34:16] Is it not the question? many times
[2:34:20] who wants to see Jesus Christ the same
[2:34:22] day.
[2:34:28] I pray that God opens our eyes
[2:34:33] that we might see.
[2:34:37] Come on, church.
[2:34:39] You don't have to do magic.
[2:34:42] You don't have to do a miracle.
[2:34:45] You don't have to heal the sick.
[2:34:56] Hallelujah.
[2:34:59] Oh, may the showers of blessing fall
[2:35:01] like the rain fall.
[2:35:04] Hallelujah.
[2:35:06] May we become wet.
[2:35:08] May the may the water of the Holy Ghost,
[2:35:12] the water of life
[2:35:15] overfloods.
[2:35:17] [Music]
[2:35:20] [Applause]
[2:35:26] Give me give me 10 minutes and then
[2:35:30] shift it to the afternoon. The Lord's
[2:35:31] willing
[2:35:33] because it's so beautiful.
[2:35:35] You will see what did Abraham do. Come
[2:35:37] on. What did Abraham do to let him Jesus
[2:35:42] Christ be the same?
[2:35:44] Tell me what did he do?
[2:35:47] How many dead people Abraham raised?
[2:35:54] Come again. How many dead people?
[2:35:59] How many dead people he raised?
[2:36:03] [Music]
[2:36:05] Zero.
[2:36:07] Zero.
[2:36:10] So that means Jesus Christ can be the
[2:36:13] same in your life
[2:36:16] even if you never raise a dead.
[2:36:21] [Applause]
[2:36:29] Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:36:32] How many sick people
[2:36:36] Abraham healed?
[2:36:49] had mistakes.
[2:36:55] Come on, church. Did Abraham had
[2:36:58] mistakes?
[2:37:02] Did Abraham lied?
[2:37:13] And God told him, "Be perfect
[2:37:18] and walk before me.
[2:37:29] Amen. Come on church judge. Are we the
[2:37:33] royal seed of Abraham?
[2:37:37] If we are in Christ,
[2:37:40] if we are Christ,
[2:37:42] we are the royal seed of Abraham.
[2:37:47] So if you are in Christ,
[2:37:50] you are the royal seed of Abraham.
[2:37:52] And if you're the roy of Abraham,
[2:37:56] brother Brandon would say, you walked
[2:37:58] the same way Abraham walked.
[2:38:02] Amen. The same steps he did, you did.
[2:38:07] You But you are not called from Cala.
[2:38:11] [Music]
[2:38:12] You are
[2:38:15] you are not called out out of Calalda
[2:38:20] because you are not living in cala.
[2:38:23] [Music]
[2:38:27] You understand that? Come on church. But
[2:38:30] you are called out like Abraham was
[2:38:32] called out.
[2:38:35] Is it not so? God called you out from
[2:38:39] wherever he found you.
[2:38:42] He called you out denomination. He
[2:38:44] called you out of the world. He called
[2:38:46] you out of sin.
[2:38:48] And like he called Abraham,
[2:38:51] he called you.
[2:38:53] Abraham, come out
[2:38:55] and go into the country that I show
[2:38:58] thee.
[2:39:01] What was it? Not if you do.
[2:39:06] I have done it already.
[2:39:09] an unconditional covenant.
[2:39:13] Give me allow me quickly to a little bit
[2:39:17] more. Go to what is a covenant by the
[2:39:19] way?
[2:39:21] You know God making a covenant with
[2:39:23] Abraham.
[2:39:25] It was not Abraham making one with God.
[2:39:30] Many times we try to make covenants with
[2:39:32] God. Right?
[2:39:34] So Lord I promise you if you do this
[2:39:38] I do that. We try to make a We try to
[2:39:42] make a covenant with God.
[2:39:46] Is that right?
[2:39:49] We want to pull God
[2:39:52] on our level.
[2:39:55] This is exactly what a covenant is.
[2:40:03] What is a marriage covenant?
[2:40:07] The husband
[2:40:09] is calling a wife
[2:40:12] to his level.
[2:40:17] Hallelujah. Is that correct? Come on,
[2:40:19] church.
[2:40:20] She even has a new name.
[2:40:25] Amen.
[2:40:27] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Come on, church. That's a
[2:40:31] covenant.
[2:40:33] A covenant is,
[2:40:35] allow me quickly to make that plain.
[2:40:39] A covenant
[2:40:41] is a describing a relationship
[2:40:46] that is based on mutal commitments.
[2:40:50] [Music]
[2:40:57] And that covenant
[2:41:00] was without condition.
[2:41:04] Give me a few minutes.
[2:41:07] I trust you can be here this afternoon.
[2:41:11] Maybe we will finish it up.
[2:41:15] We are already in gear four.
[2:41:20] Right.
[2:41:22] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:27] Amen.
[2:41:29] Abraham
[2:41:38] came somewhere in the middle of the
[2:41:40] Bible,
[2:41:43] not in the beginning.
[2:41:47] Brother Brandon would say
[2:41:49] God made three covenants.
[2:41:55] One covenant with Adam,
[2:41:59] one covenant with Noah
[2:42:02] and then a covenant with Abraham.
[2:42:07] Matthew 1,
[2:42:10] something for you to know, something to
[2:42:12] ponder about.
[2:42:15] Matthew 1.
[2:42:17] The generation of Jesus Christ
[2:42:22] starts with whom? Abraham,
[2:42:30] go to Matthew 1.
[2:42:35] Take Matthew 1.
[2:42:38] Go to Matthew 1.
[2:42:40] [Music]
[2:42:42] How is the generation of Jesus Christ
[2:42:44] beginning?
[2:42:49] Let's go to Matthew 1,
[2:42:52] New Testament. This is how our New
[2:42:54] Testament starts, right?
[2:42:57] [Music]
[2:43:00] The book of the generation of Jesus
[2:43:02] Christ, the son of David, the son of
[2:43:04] Abraham.
[2:43:06] Now go to the second verse.
[2:43:18] I blame
[2:43:24] is not amazing.
[2:43:29] It starts with Abraham,
[2:43:32] not with Adam.
[2:43:37] Did you ever ponder why it was Abraham?
[2:43:45] And
[2:43:47] if we are in Christ,
[2:43:50] we are the royal seed of
[2:43:54] [Applause]
[2:43:55] [Music]
[2:43:58] not Adam.
[2:44:05] Is Paul confused?
[2:44:08] Is Paul confused
[2:44:10] when he said to the Galatians?
[2:44:14] If we are in Christ,
[2:44:16] we are the royal seed of Abraham,
[2:44:21] not the royal seed of Adam,
[2:44:24] not the royal seed of Noah,
[2:44:27] the royal seed of Abraham.
[2:44:31] [Music]
[2:44:35] Yes, sir. It starts with Abraham. Can I
[2:44:38] blame
[2:44:40] something wrong?
[2:44:47] Somebody don't know history or don't
[2:44:50] know.
[2:44:51] [Music]
[2:44:57] Hey, it's Paul a little confused.
[2:45:02] Has he he he read the the Torah, the
[2:45:04] books of the Old Testament?
[2:45:09] And he knows exactly the genealogy.
[2:45:14] He know exactly that the seventh from
[2:45:17] Adam was Enoch.
[2:45:20] [Music]
[2:45:21] Not even with Enoch. It starts
[2:45:26] [Music]
[2:45:30] it starts with a man
[2:45:33] that was an idol worshipper.
[2:45:38] The generation of Jesus Christ
[2:45:42] starts with an idol worship.
[2:45:45] [Applause]
[2:45:52] So it shows you
[2:45:54] wherever you are at
[2:45:58] God can chose you.
[2:46:03] There's no sin too big.
[2:46:06] There's nothing too hard for God.
[2:46:10] Whatever your past was,
[2:46:13] he can make it a brilliant future.
[2:46:16] He took an idol worshipper
[2:46:21] started with him the generation of Jesus
[2:46:23] Christ.
[2:46:28] Why Abraham?
[2:46:31] H
[2:46:34] okay we have to close time is running.
[2:46:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then because
[2:46:41] maybe we have to finish this
[2:46:44] because we have to understand what God
[2:46:45] is doing
[2:46:48] when God made the first covenant
[2:46:52] with man. It was with Adam.
[2:46:55] Is that right? And what was the first
[2:46:58] covenant?
[2:47:00] It was a re it was describing a
[2:47:03] relationship.
[2:47:07] Yes.
[2:47:09] He said Adam you are me in another form.
[2:47:15] Okay. You are God of the earth. I'm God
[2:47:19] of heaven.
[2:47:22] So a covenant
[2:47:24] is also an agreement.
[2:47:27] A covenant is also a multiplication
[2:47:31] mandate
[2:47:36] because it was told to Adam,
[2:47:39] multiply
[2:47:40] and replenish the earth.
[2:47:43] That's a covenant.
[2:47:45] Is that correct?
[2:47:47] Brother Brandham said, "What did God do?
[2:47:51] Christ the mystery of God revealed."
[2:47:54] said God
[2:47:56] put men
[2:47:58] in partnership with him.
[2:48:01] Is that right? That's a covenant,
[2:48:03] church.
[2:48:06] God is making a covenant.
[2:48:08] God telling to Adam. You are my partner.
[2:48:12] He said, "Okay."
[2:48:17] Amen. Amen. Come on, church.
[2:48:21] Is it not amazing?
[2:48:24] When the all earth was flooded,
[2:48:30] Noah moved up.
[2:48:34] Finally,
[2:48:35] nobody on earth anymore.
[2:48:39] Is that right? All human beings are
[2:48:42] gone.
[2:48:45] Everything is gone.
[2:48:47] Is that correct?
[2:48:49] Noah stepped out of the ark.
[2:48:53] You know what God told him?
[2:48:56] Multiply
[2:48:58] and replenish the earth.
[2:49:06] Come on, church. What did he tell to
[2:49:09] Abraham?
[2:49:11] Nothing else.
[2:49:13] Abraham, he called him out. He said,
[2:49:18] "Your seed
[2:49:19] will be like the stars.
[2:49:22] with other words
[2:49:26] multiply
[2:49:27] and replenish the earth.
[2:49:32] Hallelujah. You're with me.
[2:49:36] Now with that we are leaving
[2:49:40] because we we want to this is this is uh
[2:49:43] we speak of Abraham and the covenant.
[2:49:47] It's a covenant without conditions.
[2:49:51] But the covenant,
[2:49:53] you can understand
[2:49:55] is only effective
[2:49:59] if Abraham walks in his duties.
[2:50:09] The covenant you have that God gave you
[2:50:13] is unconditionally.
[2:50:16] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:18] Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:50:21] And it becomes effective.
[2:50:24] Genesis 15 said after these things.
[2:50:27] [Music]
[2:50:28] Genesis 7. Genesis 7 said after these
[2:50:31] things.
[2:50:33] Even Genesis 22 it said after these
[2:50:35] things.
[2:50:37] After things that Abraham did,
[2:50:40] God appeared to him. after he separated
[2:50:44] from Lot,
[2:50:45] God came back to him and renewed the the
[2:50:48] covenant.
[2:50:51] Is that right?
[2:50:53] Amen. Amen. With that, I'm closing
[2:50:56] because we have to close
[2:50:59] just to understand what covenant we
[2:51:02] have.
[2:51:04] What covenant we have?
[2:51:06] Are you in the generation of Jesus
[2:51:08] Christ?
[2:51:12] There's 14 generations.
[2:51:15] [Music]
[2:51:17] You can bring the scripture up. Maybe
[2:51:18] it's 14 generations from Abraham.
[2:51:23] Can give it to him.
[2:51:28] Goes a little further.
[2:51:30] I don't have it for me, but said there's
[2:51:32] 14 generations
[2:51:36] from Abraham.
[2:51:38] We should quickly find it. I think it's
[2:51:40] very important.
[2:51:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And
[2:51:44] you go ahead at home and you count it.
[2:51:47] You read your Bible.
[2:51:50] 14 generations. Give that if you find
[2:51:52] that. Sorry to don't let you know that
[2:51:54] before, but if you can find it quickly,
[2:51:59] you have it. Okay. So, listen. 17. So,
[2:52:03] all the generations from Abraham to
[2:52:05] David are 14 generations.
[2:52:07] [Music]
[2:52:09] And from David until the carrying away
[2:52:11] into Babylon are 14 generations.
[2:52:15] [Music]
[2:52:18] And from the carrying away
[2:52:21] into Babylon are 14. And from the
[2:52:23] carrying away into Babations.
[2:52:31] If you count it carefully,
[2:52:34] you will find here
[2:52:37] to Christ only 13 generations.
[2:52:43] You do your homework, you count it.
[2:52:48] 144
[2:52:51] and from Babylon to Christ,
[2:52:54] you will find in your own Bible
[2:52:58] only 13 generations.
[2:53:02] Hallelujah.
[2:53:05] You know why?
[2:53:08] You are
[2:53:10] the last generation.
[2:53:15] We are the final generation
[2:53:21] that makes Jesus Christ complete.
[2:53:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:53:30] You know why?
[2:53:31] Because we have a covenant with God.
[2:53:37] Hallelujah.

[2:54:18] before you were born.
[2:54:21] Hallelujah. He put your name in the
[2:54:24] lamb's book of life
[2:54:27] before you came to earth.
[2:54:32] You understand
[2:54:38] to make it very clear.
[2:54:41] Amen. Even if you make a mistake,
[2:54:46] you can never lose that.
[2:54:48] [Music]
[2:54:51] You can never lose the covenant.
[2:54:54] [Music]
[2:54:56] Can we say praise the Lord?

[2:55:26] about
[2:55:29] the duties
[2:55:32] of Abraham
