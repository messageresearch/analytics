Father oh we are so grateful for the privilege to come into your presence we pray that Lord you may give us strength Lord and courage father to continue on this journey that Lord we may not look at the things that happen around around us but we may look at the promise looking unto Jesus we thank you Father bless us again this afternoon Lord speak to our hearts father encourage us father and establish us Before You Lord For Your Glory and for your honor Lord may you meet all the needs of your children father in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen let us go to Romans chapter 1 Romans 1 and verse 16 Verse 18 so the Bible says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew fast and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness may God blessing of his word you may be seated I want to preach on living by faith praise the name of our Lord living by faith and so here the Bible has told us that the just shall live by faith you have faith that's why you alive praise the name of our Lord and you know God has made sure that the life that we live every day we live it by faith you leave it by knowing that I'm going to do this and then you find you are fulfilling it and then brother Bram gives a simple example that by the time you left home you had faith that when you leave home you will be able to go back home and so that is Faith and then he said faith is common praise the name of our lord it's common and so now even our lives we have to live by faith not by the opportunities that we see around but then we believe in the Lord that whatever we have need of he will bring it to us and that should be our life every day praise the name of our Lord like something simple we can ask ourselves we need the air to live but how many of us have stored air for the night I have kept some air here to keep the where have you kept it you remember during the times of Corona where people are paying 3 to 5 Millions put them on oxygen per day every day 3 to 5 millions and then you look at how many days you have lived here on Earth so where has that air been coming from or another thing how many of us have stored the Sun for tomorrow how many of us but you see we know that God has put these things in in the system and then we have faith that tomorrow it will shine like now the farmers you know they are busy working on their Gardens planting the seed until you get even some precious SE and then you plant the seeds but you have faith that this seed is going to multiply and then it to reach to maturity so then you find that our daily life moves by faith but then there are things we do and we don't realize that we are exercising faith and then you remember brother Bram in the prayer line or when he was doing discernment even tell some people that you even don't know that you have that Faith praise the name of our Lord so but then our lives as Christians should be based on faith and faith is also based on the word of God faith is based on the Promises of God yes we know that the Lord has commanded the universe so then you have faith in What the Lord Has say praise the name of our Lord and then you take God at his word and say say Lord you promised this and here is what what I desire and then the Bible says that whatever we have desire of whatever we have need of in Mark 11 Mark 11 and then verse 22 and Jesus answering sayi unto them have faith in God says have faith believe God trust God have confidence in God that when I ask him this he will give it to me that when I have a need andone this is my desire then the Lord will speedily give it to me for I say unto you that soever shall say unto this mountain be th removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith praise the name of our Lord he says if you believe praise the name of the Lord you said to this mountain be removed and you don't start doubting is it going to happen maybe it may not oh I can't do it so you don't put yourself in areas of doubt but then you put yourself in believing that what you have said then it shall come to pass and then you shall have what you said we need to have faith then he says therefore I say unto you whatever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen he said whatsoever things you desire we have different needs we have different challenges we have different kind of troubles we are going through so in the midst of the trouble you're going through what is your desire what is your prayer praise the name of our Lord because he says whatever you desire whatever challenge you are going through and then you go and present it to the Lord and say Lord It's You said whatever we need let me ask you praise the name of our Lord like you look at our Lord Jesus Christ when our Lord Jesus Christ was on us and then he would go to a particular place and then he finds people and then they say help me help me like when he got the lepers they were crying oh help us then Jesus would ask them what will I do for you it's the same scenario the Le said that I may be clean and then he commands the Leos to leave when he gets the blind people somewhere and then he said what can I do for you oh we want to see our eyes he said be made whole then again he get the Lim ones what do you want me to do I want to walk are you getting it so every person had a particular needs and even n look at the woman of the blood issue the Bible says she had spent all her living going to this doctor going to this technician and then you hear maybe there's this product ah then you run Chinese medicine is strong she spends on Chinese oh indan now is better you spend on Indian all African is now the best you spend on African did all those places this multivitamin this one year this one year the doctors would check the system here is not well developed then again she many years but when she heard about Christ what he was doing raising the dead Healing The Sick then she said if but I can touch the H of his G praise the name of and we have now the same opportunity that right now Christ is not in his C body on us but now Christ is in his body on us now Christ came down in the form of the Holy Spirit and then he's the one who said whatever you believe so then you can touch him the Bible says he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities he is a high priest so then when you go before the high priest what is your confession before the high priest what is your request before the high priest and then you don't limit yourself and if you ask him to do something and he answers it and tomorrow there is another need don't fail to ask him for that need also and say Lord again there is this kind of this kind of Lord again this kind of Lord again this kind of so God wants us to live depending upon him and you know the Bible even tells us let us go to the Book of John chapter 3 and then verse 27 the Bible says John answered and said a man can receive nothing except be given him from heaven so you can't receive anything unless the heavens release but now the heavens have Saed what whatever you desire and then the heavens Will Make A Way praise the name of the Lord the heavens will make a way brother Bram was challenging people why do you have fake gifts when the whole Heaven is full of gifts and then he was also saying why do you want to ask God little when he say said ask and you'll be given abundantly and then he says to will be like a rat in the silos of Egypt big silos and then the r say let me eat one grain today because it may get over this is what we're doing you go to the ocean let me just get a spoon of water to save the others can't exhaust it and that's the same thing without our God we can't exhaust him so ask abundantly regardless of what your need is and our needs are not the same praise the name of our Lord our needs are not the same you know like when when for example praise the name of our Lord when somebody is not married that's the prayer and I remember their brothers and sisters who are not married sometimes they would not miss overnight praying desperately now when they got married ah overnight is not [Laughter] anymore and then there are also others who would come and sing but when they got married I don't know what happened to their voices but that was their Target anyway but there are many needs to ask God for Lord I need this Lord I need this Lord I need this and then you should ask without tiring praise the name of our Lord so when you marry oh Lord let us give birth that's your need and now when when the sister is expecting like I remember the time I was in Dam 2 years ago it was Christmas time so we moving near I mean rather hospital and then there was a wife and a husband and it was raining so the husband was carrying the umbrella and then the heavy wife was moving slowly I think they told them you do some exercise and they are moving and it was raining for us we were going to church now such a woman her need is not school Fe at that time honey is God deliver me out of this situation then after giving birth hone need is Lord let me raise my child now if the child is raised Lord give me school fees and now when school fees has been the child is going to school then they need changes oh Lord protect my child from these homosexuals or these kind of things bad influences and then the child keeps on growing so the needs keep on changing so that's why God didn't limit us he says whatsoever because not the need keep on change this morning may not be my need right now my need right now may not be my need at night maybe in the morning I was feeling cold say oh I need some sunshine and then when the sunshine comes and again it becomes too hot let me look for a shade it keeps on changing and again maybe at night but why has the sun taken long without going the needs keep on changing praise the name of our Lord like when you are hungry you need to eat when you have eaten eating is no longer your need you satisfied so another need comes in maybe if you eat something which is not good then again the stomach starts and then now you need God heal me from this kind shifting needs and that's what the life we're living so go didn't limit you on what you have to ask and then you shouldn't get tired of praying don't be tired of asking God what you have need if my need is this Lord I need this if my need is this Lord I need this praise the name of our Lord see how God is so gracious to us that he has put it in our hands what do you have need praise the name of our what do you want the master to do for you don't limit Yourself Praise the name of our just tell him Lord this is my name maybe the following day another thing the other day another thing then maybe you remember if the Lord has answered my prayer then you remember another person who is in maybe your brother your sister your children your parents your friends or colleages then you start seeking the Lord for them and say Lord I pray for him Lord I pray for her Lord I petition you that's what the Lord wants us to living by faith living a life that is depending on God you're not depending upon yourself and the heavens have all that we have need of brother Bram says in the message deep calls the Deep then he says there wouldn't be a fish would not have the things to fre if there was no water but what did the Lord do he first created the water for the fish to swim in the water the tree wouldn't grow if there was no ask so even you you can never have a need if there is no response to that so the Deep responds to the Deep by the time you have a need that means there's something to answer that praise the name of our Lord if you have a need of anything it means that there is something God has prepared to respond to that need praise the name of our Lord now you look at the principle of God praise the name of our Lord see how the Lord works out things brother Bram he had you know his life was strange to himself even to other people and then now people would criticize him the gifts you have are not of God and then he told his wife one day I'm tired of this let me go and pray pray to God if I don't come I don't come I want him to take away this kind of then he went in the cave and he honestly started [Music] praying and then in the course of the night then he saw the light coming and then it came big as it drew nearer and immed stopped before him and then an angel appeared now because God wanted to Vis him because God wanted to reveal himself to brother BR he had to create a burden in his heart to desire that praise the name of and that's how the Lord Works he creates a deep here to because there is a deep has provided so whatever need you have there is a deep respond to that praise the name of our Lord there is a deep respond to that de when your desire is to get a job it means that there is a job that has been provided when your desire is not to marry it means there's a person God has prepared so then he works the other side and this side praise the name of our Lord when there is a desire to do something it's simply because God is putting it upon you to show that he has already provided for praise the name of our that's how the Lord works so when you have a desire when you have a need just present it before the Lord Lord this is what I have and then the Lord will facilitate that the Lord will bring it close to you the Lord will manifest what you're looking for the will release what you're looking for praise the name of our Lord so then we need to learn how to live by faith praise the name of our Lord in whatever things that we desire in whatever thing that we have need of praise the name of our Lord and then in the message Hebrews chapter 1 I said that's the only way you can do a right kind of job for the Lord Lord is put everything you've got right to the Forefront for Christ all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind everything that you got when you are doing anything do it right or don't do it at all see just leave it alone you are going to be a Christian put everything that you've got to Christ that's your time your talent your everything and now when you do that you are yielding yourself to the leadership of God in other words you are getting the mind of God praise the name of our Lord and when you get the mind of God and then you say anything it is as good as God saying it praise the name of our Lord because you have yielded yourself you've surrendered yourself to him so then he he takes over your mind takes over your thinking so everything you speak it comes to pass praise the name of our Lord so we need to learn how to live by faith let us go to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and then verse seven for we walk by faith not by sight praise the name of the Lord we walk by faith we have confidence that he that has started a good work in US himself will bring it to completion praise the name of our Lord and that should be our daily living Lord this is my desire so when I've started something I have confidence in God that I'm going to get what I desire I'm going to get what I'm targeting for and then the Lord will bring it so you don't walk by what you are seeing you don't walk by what opportunities you have oh just say now now for me I get a small salary and then now your small salary even you put your faith on that small salary you don't look at that look at the promise praise the name of our Lord look at the promise like a sick person you go to the medicales you know and you don't look at those things you want to be healed then you look at that by his stripes I was healed praise the name of Lord if you find you are you don't have you are poor then he said let the poor say I am rich so you look beyond the circumstances your you look beyond the opportunities you have around and then you look to the god that is more than to meet all our needs praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says they that observe lying vanities in Jonah chapter 2 the Book of Jonah chapter 2 and then verse 8 they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy so what are the lying vanities the symptoms too sick ah that high fever is a symptom all the doctors have told me I'm not going to be healed is a symptom is a lying vanity so you don't look at what they have told you but you look at what the word of God says Lord this is my desire praise the name of our Lord Lord this is what I need Lord this is how I need to come out of this St Lord this is how I need to break through praise the name of our Lord that's what the Lord wants us to do that's what the Lord wants us to look to don't look at the things you're going through don't look at the negative things around you don't look at the problems you have around don't look at the travs you have around don't look at your salary you don't look at that you need it Lord provide it praise the name of our not when I look at my salary of all the loan I'm getting now it will take me 10 years now the I'm getting I cannot live in a good house oh me I cannot even get a plot you don't look at that tell god this is my name praise the name of the Lord and if it is your need and God himself knows because the Bible says his ways are past finding out his thoughts are not our thoughts his ways and not our ways for you your way that is your way but the way of God is beyond way of the thing is do I have need of this and then you see the Lord opens the door praise the name of our Lord you know like now there are some people when they when they compare their salary and the allowances they get they know that they are where there are many activities and then you can get the whole year money in one month just through allowances those kind of things or maybe is having this program and then again another project comes you now going to be the coordinator here the place of go and handle that thing for so you shouldn't look at your salary to limit your and there some is your fa praise the name of our Lord where is your Fai what do you have need do you have need of a good season or you have need of fulfilling something praise the name of the Lord he says whatever you have need of so don't look at the lying vanities Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights no hope no nothing you only looked to the Lord said I Cried unto the Lord and the Lord had my PR and the Lord himself commanded the fish and then went and vomited Jonah can you imagine Jonah was in In Jonah they were going to T they were going to t with these people he was running away with and then the Bible says let us follow that story a little while Jah 1 Jonah chter 1 and then verse 3 but Jonah rose up to flee andish from the presence of the Lord and went down to jopa and he found a ship going to tashes so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them to from the presence of the [Music] Lord now you can imagine he's already paid the fa going to t they have told him to go to n now he gets the ship going to T and now these people when the storms were so bad they made sure that they reached the the the showers very fast but they were failing until they lost all their goods and they said much as we see the town of T but we can't continue then they asked Jonah what do we do he said throw me and then they threw him in the water now the Sheep the fish where Jonah was it didn't take Jonah to but took Jonah to who commanded that it was the Lord so the Lord knows how to guide all our lives praise the name of our Lord you only yield to him say Lord this is the situation that I am in this is the condition I'm in come down in my sitation the way he guided the Sheep the fish to go to n not praise the name of our Lord and then the fish brought the prophet and he came out of the fish the way this this this sheep land and then they see them coming then they saw the prophet coming out praise the name of God God cares for all our needs we just only say Lord this is my need Lord this is my heart's desire so what is your heart's desire every one of us has a different need we have different desires and say Lord this is my need Lord this is the St I'm going through I need you to help me I need you to deliver me praise the name of our Lord he has not limited us on what we can ask whatever you have need of praise the name of whatever you have need of and at a different age in life they need changes praise the name of our Lord they need to keep on changing as we keep on living on Earth so God desires us to take interest about your need are you also concerned about what you have need of you don't there's something the Lord can do about raise it to him say Lord this is the issue Lord my house is collapsing on me then you raise it to the Lord and then the Lord will make a way for that kind of sitation praise the name of our Lord so God wants us to have faith in him praise the name of our Lord the Bible says the just shall live by faith so whatever you have need of just have confidence just have faith praise the name of God let us go to Genesis 22 and then verse six Genesis 22:6 and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac's son and he took the fire in his hand and the knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together praise the name of the Lord what a very interesting story of Abraham and Isaac Abraham taught his child how to worship praise the name of our Lord because he saw the fire he saw the firewood he saw the knife said why is the so he had been taught he had seen he was participating in it and then he was asking his father where is the lamb and Abraham by faith he didn't see where the lamb was he didn't see it God had told him offer Isaac as a b of and now Abraham that was to fulfill the word of God and now the explanation would go Isaac God will provide himself and that's how we should look at our situ that God will make a provision for my need because the lamb was not there and they were going high in the mountain but then he told him God will provide the same thing with us if I am sick God will provide the healing praise the name of our Lord if I have any need God will sustain that need if my need is full God will provide that for if my need is a house God will provide that house if my need is a job God will provide that job if my need is a wife God will provide that wife if my need is a husband God will provide a husband if my need is children God will provide a children he says God will provide himself so we shouldn't limit God but just raise our need to the Lord and say Lord this is what I have desire Lord this is what I have need of Lord come and help me this kind of situation Abraham had faith in God praise the name of our Lord even when the Lord told him come out of your land and then I I will take you to another place didn't know where he was going but he walked by faith believing in the Lord who had called him and the Bible says praise the name of our Lord that the things that we see are very temporary but the things that we don't see are Eternal so we are called to look at the Unseen as the reality praise the name of our Lord that's how the Lord wants us to live you look at the Unseen you need and say Lord this is what my need is and then you believe to actualize that thing to bring it to manifestation to bring it to reality when Abraham said the God will provide the lamb he was not seeing the Lamb but yet he believed in God that himself is more than able to provide that and that's now the same thing now how we need to live by faith how we need to live not not this not kind of you know sorrowful because of what we don't have but then you raise whatever you have need of before the Lord in prayer praise the name of the Lord in Philippians chapter 4 Philippians chapter 4 and then in verse four rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be made known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto [Music] God he says whatever you have need of what request do you have make it known unto God with prayer and Thanksgiving praise the name of the Lord just tell him what you have need of the Bible says cast all your burdens unto the Lord cast them and say Lord this is my bur Lord this is my need and put it before him and then you start thanking him Lord I Thank you you're more than to respond to this you're more than able to answer this you're more than able to provide this you're more than able to do this kind of how we need to live praise the name of our Lord a life of faith when you meet a serious need or any challenge you lift it to the need to the Lord you know like that song what a friend we have in Jesus praise the name of our Lord whatever you have need of all your cares all your Tres all your problems lift them to the Lord in prayer and you believe that the Lord is real the Bible says he that comes to God must know that God is God is real God cares God is concerned about your condition God is concerned about what you're going through and then brother Bram preaches he cares do you care praise the name of our Lord he cares for all our needs he cares for distractions we are going through he cares for whatever is paining us but do we care do we care to tell him do we care to present it before him do we care to say Lord according to your word according to your word you said whatever I have need of when I pray let me believe that I receive it and I believe now I'm receiving and then you thank God thank you for this opportunity that I can pray to you praise the name of our Lord and you just be thankful and you see the way God works even like now for example sometimes when you are praying then somebody comes in your mind that means God wants you to pray for that so even the same thing in our life and say I've remembered I don't have this kind of thing but I don't have enough money it has come to your mind then you pray to God about say Lord this is my need praise the name of the Lord that's how life moves on then you go and check something somewhere something comes to your mind or interests you talk to God about it praise the name of the Lord when brother Bram was reading about the story of Joseph said Lord I Thank you for Jose and then the Lord came and told him you going to give birth to a son and call him Jes praise the name of our Lord God is concerned about us he's concerned about our Affairs so the Bible has told us whatever make your requests known unto the Lord Lord this is my need Lord this is my desire come and help me come and deliver me come and make for me even where there seems to be no way we need to live by faith whatever we have need of every day in our lives just raise it to the Lord in prayer and continue trusting in the Lord continue believing in the Lord and the Lord will make a way where there seems to be known is God that's not limited by anything is not limited by circumstances is not limited by distance is not limited by abilities but just raise it to him Lord this is my need praise the name of our Lord Lord this is my heart desire I've long for this Lord may you make it come to pass Lord may you intervene in this St praise the name of our Lord and then you'll see the Lord coming and working upon it praise the name of the Lord working upon your need working upon your request and he said that when you pray anything in my name you will receive it that your joy may be complete that's what the Lord wants us to have joyful Hearts complete Joy so he answers our needs praise the name of our Lord he makes a way where there seems to be no way that our joy may be complete praise the name of our Lord so don't undermine don't fear to lift your needs unto the Lord bringing it to the Lord in prayer Lord this is my petition look ater praise the name of much as there was a law against doing what she was going to do but she had the confidence she prayed until when she went before the king the king said what will I do for you what is your request what is your petition and we have the same opportunity praise the name that we ask abundantly and then the King was telling eser even to a half of the kingdom and then the scripture says we are joint hairs praise the name of our Lord we are joint hairs with Christ praise the name of our Lord then why would you want to deprive yourself when the Lord has said they all here praise the name of our Lord praise the name of Lord like when Pastor was preaching some time ago that you a son of the king but you live like AA they had the promised land but they had poverty everything was given to them why why would you want to live like that when he said ask then you ask and then you wait on him to give you why do you fear to ask why do you fear to present it before Lord this is my need Lord this is my issue Lord this is my trouble Lord this is what I'm going through we need to live by faith whatever you have need praise the name of our Lord and don't allow the devil to tell you that is not for you oh this is not the time ask and the Bible says when you ask what happens you receive so you believe you receive when you knock what happens the door is open when you seek what happens you find all these are promises that the Lord we need to live by faith and present all our cares present all our needs present all our abundance unto the Lord in prayer and say Lord this is my desire Lord this is my need praise the name of our Lord live by faith trust in the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then he will make it

com oh glor amen praise the name of Lord we are now starting the session of the Lord supper praise the name of our Lord so I want us to turn to our Bibles and go to the book of First Corinthians chapter 11 we're reading from verse 23 after to verse 2 six it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same man also he took the cup when he had Saed saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do as you of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord is death till he come may God blessing of his let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for yet this session we are going to do of observing the Lord supper and the foot washing you has told us that we should do it in remembrance of you and father as we commence doing this service we call upon your name heavenly father and we pray you may forgive us of all unrighteousness all our unworthiness Lord all our uncleanness Lord wash Us in the blood of Jesus Christ and father even as we partake of the body and the blood in Syle form of our Lord Jesus Christ may we be blessed Heavenly Father for The Obedience of your word pre Minister upon this service now for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name we do pray and ask this amen you may be seated as we said last year by the grace of God we've been observing this every month every first Sunday of the month last month it his brother who handled it and I want to thank God for that praise the name of our Lord and you know the Lord commanded us that we observe it you know as often as you would when you read in the book of Acts chapter 2 we can go and read that scripture Acts 2 and then we read in in verse 46 and they Contin and they continually daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did itat their me with gladness and singl of heart praising God and having favor with all the people as the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved in verse 42 he says 42 and they Contin stly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and in prayers amen so we see that the early church observed it praise the name of our Lord they were doing it as often as they would and it is so important that even you know the scripture quotes about breaking of bread the washing of feet you know as things that show that somebody is faithful praise the name of our Lord and so that's why we need to do it as often as we can and then when you come to the Lord's table make sure that you are worthy what makes you worthy it's the blood of Jesus Christ that makes it worthy praise the name of our Lord It's the blood on our own we are not worthy praise the name of our Lord but the blood that we say Lord wash me all my sins wash away all my trespasses and make me clean make me right that I can be right before you to observe of the Lord's supper and now all those that have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then you are living in that blood you need to be part of the Lord you need to be part of the foot washing praise the name of our Lord so we just now to start it we are conscious of time you know I was trying to find out when do they observe supper and then you know they were saying from 5:00 maybe up around 9:00 when do they take dinner in the evening and evening starts from 5:00 up to midnight praise the name of because sometimes in other places they do it in the morning and then they saying the Lord is supper but then they taking it in Breakfast Time praise the name of our Lord but we know they took this things in the evening time and I believe now it's a qualified time where we can work on we can we can do it let us pray for the bread father in the name of Jesus Christ here is the unle bre that we are going to partake of Father observe on the body of Jesus Christ for we are the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are members in particular this one reminds us while we eat of it that we are part of this body may you bless us father as we partake of it to do this in remembrance of you in the name of Jes Jesus Christ Amen brother Wilson and William to come [Music] amen for [Music] now
