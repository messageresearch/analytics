[9:50] also
[9:54] Min so we service
[9:59] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we
[10:03] pray amen
[10:06] amen let's open the
[10:11] word the book of Philippians
[10:44] verse
[10:49] one
[10:52] if consolation in
[10:54] Christ if any comfort of love
[11:00] if any comfort of love if and
[11:06] fellowship of the spirit if any powers
[11:10] and mercies feel ye my joy that you may
[11:14] be like minded having the same love
[11:18] being of one Accord of one
[11:21] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[11:27] no Vine GR
[11:30] but in less of Mind Let each esteem the
[11:34] other better than themselves look not
[11:38] every man to his own
[11:42] things
[11:47] and
[11:52] ver verse four look not every man on his
[11:56] own things but every man also on the
[11:59] things of others let this mind be in you
[12:04] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[12:08] in the form of God thought it not Rob to
[12:12] be equal with God but made himself of no
[12:17] repetition and took upon him the form of
[12:20] a servant and was made in likeness of
[12:28] men
[12:58] for for
[13:54] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[13:56] reading of the word
[13:59] just be
[14:01] seated uh I want to thank
[14:04] God the opportunity the P to stand
[14:08] before the purch of the
[14:15] blood as
[14:19] I've is challenging and
[14:24] hard stand the of
[14:30] because they know
[14:33] the know
[14:36] message so it's really challenging to
[14:39] where
[14:45] start but I also request you to pray for
[14:50] me and may the Lord
[14:54] speak
[14:56] amen so
[15:00] here Paul
[15:02] says that Christ being in the form of
[15:08] God he
[15:11] never
[15:16] it he
[15:21] never kind of auor of
[15:29] in other words the position he was
[15:34] given he took it that
[15:37] way praise the Lord he never thought to
[15:40] be above all the powers that he
[15:46] had praise the Lord so him being in the
[15:49] form of
[15:52] man he served in
[15:55] that praise the Lord where need
[16:00] spitting on
[16:03] him he never came up as God and cast
[16:13] them the Lord sometimes they struck him
[16:17] when he was carrying the
[16:21] cross yes but him
[16:26] being he didn't come up and say I am
[16:30] good why are they doing this to
[16:35] me praise the Lord so today by the grace
[16:40] of
[16:41] God us to share on the
[16:52] unve praise the
[16:54] Lord that word uning
[17:01] unveiling praise the
[17:03] Lord that word
[17:07] unveiling it means to
[17:10] remove something that has been
[17:15] protected praise the Lord to remove what
[17:20] was
[17:24] shielding praise the Lord that is what
[17:27] that word means
[17:33] un praise the
[17:36] Lord so the unveiling of
[17:42] God praise the
[17:44] Lord
[17:45] here we
[17:47] notice that Paul
[17:50] say
[17:51] that here
[17:54] Christ him in the form of man
[17:59] he never thought
[18:02] it he never thought it
[18:06] robber to be equal with
[18:10] God so in other
[18:12] words even us
[18:15] now we have the spirit of
[18:18] Christ praise the Lord even when we have
[18:22] the spirit of
[18:24] Christ Christ doesn't expect us chist
[18:29] to go above with that
[18:38] spirit because that power of
[18:42] Christ
[18:45] do praise the Lord it can do
[18:50] anything praise the Lord if
[18:54] Christ in us he expects us
[18:59] to do what his will
[19:04] is praise the Lord expects us to do what
[19:11] his will
[19:13] is praise the Lord that's why the
[19:16] prophet
[19:17] says
[19:19] Believers we are not meant to ask God
[19:22] for
[19:25] power because the power is already in
[19:28] the church
[19:30] the power is already in
[19:33] us but what we is the
[19:38] faith what we
[19:40] La is the faith to unlock
[19:45] it are we clear you know we have the
[19:50] power Christ is in
[19:53] us we have the
[19:56] power but faith
[19:59] is what unlocks that power
[20:04] inise the Lord not because you know some
[20:10] people somebody can say it is going to
[20:13] rain
[20:22] tomorrow that's the power of
[20:25] God like that
[20:30] praise the
[20:31] Lord some people can speak things and
[20:34] you get them on
[20:38] way but Christ doesn't want us to act
[20:43] his power in that
[20:45] form he wants us to use
[20:48] his only according to his
[20:53] word the
[20:55] Lord
[20:57] now one
[20:59] time even the power of
[21:03] Christ helps us to know how to ask from
[21:11] God helps us to even
[21:15] know how we can you know how we can even
[21:21] like let me give you an
[21:24] example there was a
[21:26] time a woman
[21:29] was you know she wanted to be
[21:33] healed of
[21:36] Christ what
[21:39] did
[21:44] she praise the Lord woman said
[21:50] son Jesus
[21:54] could reason she was a gentile
[21:59] praise the
[22:02] lordes callr son
[22:05] of they don't call
[22:11] Christ praise the Lord but then there
[22:14] was another
[22:19] one this was a
[22:21] Jew when he cried son of davus
[22:30] praise the
[22:31] Lord the power that
[22:37] had know how
[22:42] toise the Lord it helped him know how he
[22:48] can call and claim on
[22:53] Christ praise the
[22:55] Lord because he was a Jew
[22:59] praise the
[23:00] Lord you have to know which words to
[23:06] use when you are before
[23:09] Christ even
[23:13] sister the best words to
[23:16] use in order for that power to
[23:20] come praise the Lord when you
[23:23] notice
[23:25] brother told told her
[23:30] poor you can ask for
[23:35] dollars the Lord just imagine you are
[23:38] before the prophet and the prophet of
[23:42] God and his first statement is you are
[23:44] poor ask for
[23:50] money
[23:52] what praise the
[23:56] Lord praise the Lord
[23:59] he says you have your sister sick you
[24:01] have this one is disorganized you have
[24:03] this like
[24:07] this praise the Lord
[24:11] sister the best words to
[24:16] use why Christ had unveiled to
[24:23] her praise the Lord Christ unveiled to
[24:27] her
[24:29] on what
[24:32] ask the
[24:34] Lord and now some of
[24:39] us you know God has given us the
[24:44] Worden and this word what God expects
[24:50] us to
[24:52] use while asking
[24:54] him don't use your words
[25:00] Jesus when he was teaching us to
[25:03] pray he never wanted us to like
[25:11] theise the
[25:13] Lord Repeat
[25:18] After Hours only one
[25:30] and the prophet tells us if God is our
[25:35] father then we don't need to shout for
[25:40] demons why do you shout for
[25:44] theil if God is your
[25:48] father and for him demons run from
[25:52] him look at
[25:55] Jesus he never I never read somewhere
[26:00] I never read
[26:01] somewhere that Jesus shouted for the
[26:04] demon to
[26:09] live somewhere heed
[26:13] fingers others they were crying before
[26:15] he had spoken
[26:18] anything so God has given us the
[26:21] word on how we can ask
[26:25] him praise the Lord
[26:29] and this
[26:30] word is already
[26:33] unveiled praise the Lord the word is
[26:35] already
[26:36] [Music]
[26:37] uniled because we're
[26:40] back let's go to Second let's go to
[26:49] Corinthians praise the Lord
[27:08] second
[27:21] Corinthians in verse let's start from
[27:24] verse
[27:29] let's start from verse four four the
[27:33] Bible say 2 Corinthians 3:4 it says and
[27:38] such trust have we through Christ to God
[27:48] one not that we are sufficient of
[27:56] ourselves to think anything as of
[28:01] ourselves but our
[28:07] sufficient praise the Lord who has made
[28:11] us able
[28:14] Ministers of the New
[28:17] Testament not of the
[28:23] later but of the
[28:25] spirit for the later kill
[28:29] but the spirit give
[28:31] life but if the ministration of
[28:36] death written and Engen in
[28:43] Stones was
[28:46] glorious so that the children of Israel
[28:49] could not steadfastly hold the face of
[28:52] Moses and the glory of the continents
[28:55] which Glory was to be done
[29:12] let's go to verse 12
[29:14] immediately seeing then that we have
[29:17] such hope we use Great Plain PL of
[29:23] speech
[29:34] and not as Moses which put a veil over
[29:38] his face that the children of Israel
[29:40] could not steadfast look to the end of
[29:43] that which
[30:00] then verse
[30:02] 14 but their minds were blinded for
[30:05] until this day remaineth the same Veil
[30:09] untaken away in the reading in the
[30:11] reading of the Old Testament which ve is
[30:15] done away in Christ
[30:40] but even unto this day when Moses is
[30:43] read the veil is upon their heart
[30:58] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[31:01] Lord the veil shall be taken
[31:11] awaya the
[31:13] Lord them
[31:16] days you know in the days of
[31:20] Moses that
[31:23] glory god never wanted anybody to share
[31:26] that Glory
[31:31] praise the Lord that's why when Moses
[31:33] was going on the
[31:36] mountain forid even animal to go on
[31:43] that praise the Lord God even forbade
[31:46] men to go with
[31:49] Moses he wanted Moses
[31:53] alone why he wanted to retain That Glory
[31:57] of himself
[32:02] praise the
[32:04] Lord in veil of
[32:09] Moses that
[32:11] day in the veil of
[32:15] Moses praise the Lord when he
[32:20] hides Here Comes
[32:22] Moses and when he came before the
[32:25] people his face was sh
[32:31] shining the first was
[32:34] shining and had to
[32:40] cover if that shadow Glory was very
[32:50] glorious the Lord because
[32:53] then was still there
[32:58] praise the Lord the was still there but
[33:01] here when it comes to the
[33:05] Lord Paul says the ve shall be taken
[33:10] away praise the Lord and what
[33:14] happens when the veil is taken
[33:18] away what is it we have
[33:22] Fellowship straight
[33:24] away we have Fellowship straight away
[33:30] with the Lord
[33:31] himself because the ve is no longer
[33:35] there praise the Lord and what
[33:39] happens in their
[33:42] days they had the holy of
[33:46] holies it was
[33:49] failed and then one was the only one to
[33:53] get
[33:56] there praise the Lord and what
[33:59] happened what was behind that
[34:03] Veil it was the Ark of the
[34:09] Covenant it was the word of
[34:13] God which was veiled in
[34:17] there praise the Lord now that's why the
[34:21] prophet
[34:23] says that ve which was protecting the
[34:26] word of God
[34:33] when it comes to
[34:34] Christ it comes to the
[34:37] Lord he takes it
[34:39] away then
[34:42] whats it's the word of God praise the
[34:46] lord we have
[34:49] fellowship with the word PL view in
[34:53] Us Praise the Lord if the word is PL
[34:57] with us
[35:00] then why don't we know how to
[35:04] praise the
[35:06] Lord until the prophet
[35:09] says don't wait to be in
[35:14] trouble that you can
[35:16] pray if you
[35:19] have
[35:22] always because when trial
[35:25] comes sometimes you may not have time to
[35:30] when those circumstance comes
[35:34] us sometimes may not have time to
[35:38] pray praise the Lord now accident finds
[35:44] way how are you going to when the legs
[35:46] are
[35:49] up praise the Lord if you are
[35:53] normal that's the best time to pray
[35:56] that's the best time to pray
[35:59] praise the Lord our young our young
[36:05] sisters us

[36:11] now don't wait to be used up with the
[36:17] devil praise the Lord don't wait to be
[36:21] done
[36:26] when come to the house of
[36:30] God wants to use us
[36:33] now when your life is
[36:36] clean that can
[36:39] stand and say there is a
[36:44] Joseph's wife can't defile
[36:48] him because God is confident in
[36:54] Joseph praise the Lord even us now
[36:58] God wants to use
[37:00] Us Praise the
[37:02] Lord God wants to use
[37:05] us but you see some of young
[37:11] people like I've said the is done
[37:16] away and the word is in view
[37:20] now praise the Lord just
[37:24] imagine in 5 years back
[37:30] we didn't have Fellowship like we have
[37:36] now yes praise the lord we used to end
[37:40] on
[37:42] overnight
[37:44] Services Sunday Services Sunday Services
[37:47] radio programs which some didn't even
[37:53] listen but now God has brought us again
[37:56] on WhatsApp
[38:00] and we are there with
[38:05] fellow why
[38:08] don'tk the word is plain in
[38:12] view that we have no any I mean we have
[38:17] no anything like we don't have
[38:20] it praise the
[38:23] Lord the word go behind there
[38:27] books are like
[38:29] this some are even
[38:32] roting praise the
[38:35] Lord praise the Lord so we have the word
[38:39] in PL
[38:41] View and then God expects
[38:44] us come and fellowship around the
[38:49] word praise the Lord God expects young
[38:53] people and every believer
[38:58] that when his word is before him he us

[39:08] be
[39:10] cleansed praise the
[39:12] Lord God is already
[39:17] unveiled praise the Lord God is already
[39:23] unveil amen so what happens now
[39:29] in their
[39:30] days they used not to understand the
[39:33] unveiling of
[39:36] God when
[39:39] come some of
[39:41] them speak against
[39:45] him praise the Lord some of them could
[39:50] not recognize he's the
[39:53] one why he was hidden
[39:59] praise the Lord one
[40:05] timeing got
[40:08] sicking got
[40:11] sick then on his he went to cons the
[40:14] gods

[40:21] happens God sent
[40:25] Elijah go and meet those
[40:28] vants ask them is there no God in
[40:35] Israel but where was
[40:38] God praise the Lord where was
[40:42] God
[40:44] Elijah praise the Lord God was in
[40:49] Elijah veiled
[40:53] in and expected men to go and consult
[41:00] from the Lord that's what
[41:04] done praise the Lord even people who
[41:08] used secret and to go and do things
[41:10] without his
[41:20] consent without him being
[41:24] aware was watching
[41:29] praise the Lord even to us
[41:32] Believers God is always conscious of

[41:53] people not

[42:41] way praise the Lord no one knows when
[42:45] the rupture will
[42:46] come the word contains
[42:51] it praise the Lord what we have to do
[42:55] come in plain Fellowship with that
[43:00] word praise the Lord come in The View
[43:04] with that
[43:06] word praise the Lord because if we
[43:10] believe the
[43:13] message really C our
[43:17] hearts why don't you post them on
[43:22] stus praise the Lord some of us have
[43:25] many followers
[43:28] some of us have people who see our
[43:32] statuses why don't you the word which
[43:35] you
[43:38] believe but you know the Devil Makes
[43:42] Us the prophet says a statement which
[43:45] makes me
[43:48] timid that we worship the devil when we
[43:51] don't
[43:55] know how do we do
[43:58] what are youting on your
[44:02] WhatsApp praise the Lord
[44:07] of it is very hard to explain the life
[44:10] behind
[44:12] it some of them are videos that have
[44:15] long some minutes
[44:22] long and then you wonder this believer
[44:25] who has put this
[44:29] why didn't youst the
[44:34] church praise the
[44:37] Lord but
[44:39] then may the Lord bless so what I
[44:43] feel when the word is
[44:47] in let us be
[44:50] confident the Lord because the Bible
[44:53] says the word of God is powerful
[44:58] you may not speak to somebody that is
[45:02] converted but that word poed
[45:06] there touch people's
[45:09] s praise the Lord because we are hunting
[45:13] for the last
[45:15] one and all the
[45:19] sources all the
[45:21] sources they have God
[45:32] social Tik Tok WhatsApp Facebook on
[45:37] radio
[45:38] programs post things there if you have
[45:43] access to tell
[45:46] God I'm in your
[45:50] words praise the Lord praise the Lord
[45:54] now when that word is in plain
[45:58] view God expects
[46:01] us to be transformed with the same
[46:06] worda the
[46:10] Lord praise the
[46:13] Lord because what I
[46:16] say
[46:18] God in those
[46:20] days he hid those servants the holy men
[46:27] and most of the
[46:29] people acted the Life of Christ when
[46:32] they don't
[46:35] know praise the Lord and then here
[46:38] Christ
[46:39] comes when he came he was fulfilling
[46:43] what they had spoken what they had
[46:50] lived but their children were not
[46:55] taught until when Christ
[46:57] came they were not sober to search
[47:03] back how did Joseph live his
[47:07] life praise the Lord how did David live
[47:11] his
[47:13] life compared to
[47:16] Christ his
[47:18] life compared to
[47:21] Christ when Christ says spoke of me
[47:27] these people to look back to
[47:30] Moses and then they refer to him
[47:35] here praise the Lord even us the prophet
[47:39] has spoken a lot of
[47:42] things he has spoken many many many
[47:46] promises until some of them we see
[47:50] them praise the Lord some of them we see
[47:54] them but how do we take conscious of
[47:59] them praise the
[48:02] Lord don't
[48:04] wait to hear when someone has seen a
[48:07] dead person like maybe somebody has Ren
[48:09] and seen and then you start to panic to
[48:11] come to
[48:18] church
[48:20] Lord
[48:25] know praise the
[48:27] Lord what is to
[48:30] do get ready
[48:32] now because the word is already in plain
[48:36] view so you get ready
[48:39] now so that even though you hear
[48:41] somebody so
[48:47] resurrected prise the Lord never told us
[48:51] the prophet never told us when you see
[48:54] one arise
[48:57] you conting
[49:00] Church praise the Lord he said the will
[49:05] even find you at
[49:07] work find you
[49:10] anywhere praise the Lord some will be
[49:14] sleeping so how are you going to get in
[49:19] sise the Lord the time is
[49:23] now when the word is open when the word
[49:26] is
[49:29] unveiled this is the time praise the
[49:32] Lord and you know when God shows his
[49:37] word he has always wanted
[49:40] people to come around his
[49:44] word praise the Lord he has always
[49:47] wanted
[49:48] men come around his
[49:52] word amen amen but sometimes
[49:57] circumstances push us far from this
[50:02] word praise the
[50:04] Lord
[50:05] until this is
[50:09] real and the prophet spoke
[50:12] it and
[50:14] said
[50:16] Satan has set
[50:20] schools but schools are
[50:23] good butan them
[50:27] to make us off the
[50:29] word teach us off the
[50:33] word praise the Lord that's why when you
[50:36] go to
[50:37] schools some religious religion
[50:40] somewhere
[50:42] there and then when they they teach you
[50:45] who is the mother of
[50:47] Jesus they will receive you that is
[50:53] Mary that deception
[50:57] they will teach
[50:58] you the father of
[51:01] Jesus
[51:03] is should you put anything
[51:07] besides you
[51:10] Beed praise the Lord but the truth
[51:14] is the Bible teaches
[51:16] us
[51:18] Jesus having no
[51:20] father no
[51:22] mother but when you give them that
[51:25] answer
[51:28] they not Mark with
[51:31] you praise the Lord schools are
[51:36] set the
[51:38] word praise the
[51:40] Lord praise the
[51:44] Lord I heard it past preached Itor
[51:50] Robert most of the young
[51:53] people once we get the degrees
[51:57] we
[52:00] get we even nect our
[52:04] parents they can't say anything
[52:08] Nows when mother tells why are you going
[52:11] out
[52:14] now may
[52:16] not
[52:19] right praise the
[52:21] Lord then what is that before God
[52:26] the Lord he has set
[52:32] hospitals praise the Lord and these
[52:35] hospitals they have driven
[52:39] us from their
[52:45] unveiled praise the
[52:48] lord we don't have faith in the word of
[52:54] God and yet is before
[52:58] us what could
[53:02] it it's the
[53:05] word Fai in that
[53:08] word praise the
[53:10] Lord praise the Lord so God has always
[53:16] wanted his children to be much
[53:21] different praise the Lord he has always
[53:24] wanted his children to be different from
[53:26] the
[53:29] world that's why the word is in
[53:35] view to give us a
[53:38] standard The Life of
[53:41] Christ praise the Lord that when he
[53:44] comes when Christ comes then we are like
[53:50] him because this word is
[53:53] here praise the
[53:55] Lord in the last
[53:58] days in the last
[54:01] days God has rent
[54:06] the praise the Lord he hasent
[54:11] it and brought the
[54:14] word for this
[54:16] AG write in plain
[54:20] view praise the Lord in these last days
[54:26] rent
[54:29] the and this is
[54:32] real praise the Lord this is real the
[54:36] word is in plain
[54:40] view but the prophet says that word it
[54:44] is
[54:48] in Praise the Lord why is it
[54:53] inil because of the traditions of our
[54:56] hearts
[54:59] praise the Lord but yet God has made it
[55:04] in Praise the
[55:06] Lord but the traditions of Our
[55:11] Lives makes the word again
[55:15] fail when the word is
[55:21] performed people don't see
[55:25] it praise
[55:26] Lord when the word is being made
[55:38] manifest praise the Lord what
[55:41] happens God requests and likes
[55:47] us to be attentive whenever his word
[55:55] is praise the Lord because what is very
[56:00] hard is like the prophet
[56:03] says the hardest
[56:07] thing God has ever
[56:09] done hard
[56:12] thing is when
[56:20] the that's the
[56:23] hardest but yet God uses these
[56:28] people praise the Lord God uses
[56:34] them the people in the times of brother
[56:37] Bram they used to call
[56:41] himana but this was a man was speaking
[56:45] from
[56:46] God he was speaking direct from
[56:51] God praise the Lord meaning if we were
[56:55] to reject
[56:58] if we were to reject this
[57:01] man meaning we have rejected God
[57:05] directly praise the
[57:07] Lord therefore when the word is in plain
[57:13] view God wants us and expects
[57:18] us to be very
[57:22] atten praise the Lord because these days
[57:26] it is the manifestation of the word of
[57:29] God these are the days of the
[57:32] manifestation of the word of
[57:40] God the Lord these are the
[57:43] days we don't need to move with volumes
[57:46] of the Bible on the
[57:51] streets praise the Lord don't need to
[57:54] move with those Bibles
[57:57] we don't need to move with the volumes
[57:59] of
[58:03] messages praise the Lord be yourself the
[58:08] message praise the Lord because it is in
[58:12] VI and the prophet
[58:15] says most of us who wants to listen to
[58:17] other
[58:21] things the prophet
[58:24] says even when I've I've gone
[58:28] away refer to
[58:31] this praise the Lord even when I've gone
[58:36] away refer to
[58:40] this praise the Lord that's what the
[58:43] prophet
[58:44] says that even when he has gone
[58:48] away he expects us to listen to his
[58:54] word this is the
[58:56] message now care all the
[59:01] message care all the
[59:05] message and when you listen to this
[59:08] St when you listen to that even maybe I
[59:12] will be gone
[59:14] someday when the Lord is done when the
[59:17] Lord is finished with
[59:22] me you would refer back to this
[59:28] listen to my
[59:30] voice what I'm telling
[59:33] you me before he
[59:36] coming
[59:38] remember I have spoken to you in the
[59:41] name of the
[59:44] Lord by the word of the
[59:48] Lord praise the Lord the prophet says
[59:52] even when I've gone
[59:54] away you listen to to my
[59:57] voice to
[1:00:01] this because it is the word of God in
[1:00:06] VI praise the Lord if you've not gotten
[1:00:12] it still God has not left you
[1:00:17] alone he has brought us the Min
[1:00:22] here just call Pastor
[1:00:26] read this message I'm not getting it
[1:00:28] what's behind
[1:00:30] it maybe the V is on your
[1:00:35] face may use your
[1:00:40] P praise the
[1:00:43] lord we have a lot of people around
[1:00:47] us so even though you refer and you've
[1:00:50] not understood it
[1:00:56] what do you
[1:00:57] do God has
[1:01:01] agents praise the Lord why God the holy
[1:01:06] spirit this is a message I'm quoting God
[1:01:12] the Holy Spirit fell upon
[1:01:16] men praise the
[1:01:18] Lord the Holy Spirit fell upon
[1:01:24] men men
[1:01:26] and man I want to see this you know even
[1:01:30] when you read the
[1:01:32] message not understood it God has
[1:01:38] agents praise the
[1:01:41] Lord the holy spirit this is the message
[1:01:43] the Holy Spirit fell upon
[1:01:47] men man is I want to say
[1:01:53] that praise the Lord come on the Holy
[1:01:56] Spirit fell upon
[1:02:01] men in the message God in his
[1:02:09] people praise the
[1:02:12] Lord so he
[1:02:14] says the Holy Spirit
[1:02:19] upon praise the
[1:02:23] Lord yeah that message the Holy Spirit
[1:02:27] fell upon
[1:02:31] men is God his
[1:02:33] agent and the hardest thing that God has
[1:02:41] ever the hardest thing that God has ever
[1:02:48] had do as to do was to get one
[1:02:57] another
[1:03:01] oneise the
[1:03:03] Lord is
[1:03:06] agents and the Holy Spirit has fallen
[1:03:09] upon
[1:03:10] them to guide us along the
[1:03:14] way praise the Lord until the song
[1:03:18] writer
[1:03:19] says I'm using my Bible for the road map
[1:03:27] and the 12
[1:03:29] disciples are the
[1:03:33] signs praise the Lord so if you don't
[1:03:36] follow the
[1:03:39] signs where are you
[1:03:44] going is pointing
[1:03:47] this because you see the
[1:03:52] going praise the Lord so God
[1:03:57] wants
[1:03:58] us when he has brought his
[1:04:02] word he wants us to believe
[1:04:07] him the
[1:04:09] Lord praise the Lord because somebody
[1:04:13] who doesn't believe the word of
[1:04:17] God what does it do you displease the
[1:04:23] Lord praise the Lord and where the word
[1:04:26] of God is
[1:04:29] Not can't stay
[1:04:32] there praise the Lord he has always
[1:04:35] dwelt where his word
[1:04:39] is so when the word of God isain in our
[1:04:45] view isn't
[1:04:47] that praise the lord we have God Among
[1:04:53] Us Praise the Lord when God is in PL
[1:05:02] view why don't we
[1:05:10] ask praise the
[1:05:14] Lord because what was hidden that ve in
[1:05:17] the Old
[1:05:21] Testament word of
[1:05:24] God and that word
[1:05:26] before us
[1:05:28] now it is
[1:05:30] in Praise the Lord it is
[1:05:34] in and
[1:05:36] then the power of the Holy
[1:05:41] Spirit Glory that comes upon the
[1:05:46] believer I mean the real
[1:05:51] Believers causes the work of God and the
[1:05:54] faith of the word of God God in
[1:06:00] us praise the Lord to believe the
[1:06:05] word that's hid in the eyes of other
[1:06:11] people praise the Lord so to us when we
[1:06:16] believe the word of God when we dwell
[1:06:20] all the time with the word of
[1:06:23] God the glory of God has always been
[1:06:25] with
[1:06:27] us praise the Lord until one time pastor
[1:06:34] preached how I
[1:06:39] wish I wish you knew the gift
[1:06:44] of praise the
[1:06:47] Lord God has blessed
[1:06:49] us and His
[1:06:51] blessings they are open
[1:06:55] praise the Lord God His blessings are
[1:07:01] open but what hinders us to access
[1:07:06] them
[1:07:08] un praise the Lord but his word is
[1:07:13] already
[1:07:14] in so what we need to
[1:07:17] do let us act the
[1:07:20] word praise the Lord as I finish
[1:07:25] spirit this this is a message
[1:07:28] now if the spirit of
[1:07:32] God is really in
[1:07:35] us then we should always look at Christ
[1:07:38] as our
[1:07:42] example praise the Lord because one
[1:07:46] time okay let me read this message then
[1:07:49] I tell this as I finish brother Bram
[1:07:53] says now if I told you I was
[1:08:02] John the spirit of was on
[1:08:09] me praise the Lord have been on me and
[1:08:13] then he
[1:08:14] says you would look for me to have
[1:08:21] guns because that man had guns
[1:08:25] or act
[1:08:29] like then he says if I told you I was
[1:08:39] anti you know
[1:08:43] okay the spirit of of a great artist was
[1:08:47] on
[1:08:51] me you would expect me to paint pictures
[1:08:55] of an
[1:08:58] artist then he says again if I told you
[1:09:02] I was exp
[1:09:07] mechan and the mechanic was on
[1:09:11] me expect me to know what was wrong with
[1:09:15] your
[1:09:20] car if I tell you that I was born of the
[1:09:24] spirit of God
[1:09:28] the of
[1:09:31] Christ then he
[1:09:35] says was on me okay the spirit of Christ
[1:09:38] was on
[1:09:39] me you would expect me to do what he
[1:09:45] did act like he
[1:09:48] did that is his Spirit working through
[1:09:50] human
[1:09:53] beings praise the Lord
[1:09:56] so
[1:09:57] meaning when we have the spirit of
[1:10:02] Christ this Spirit of
[1:10:04] Christ must always drive
[1:10:07] us to look
[1:10:12] Christ praise the Lord this was in my
[1:10:19] primary I used have a friend of
[1:10:22] mine and this person loved
[1:10:25] this player you know
[1:10:30] Ronaldo
[1:10:31] and the truth
[1:10:33] is anything you see thiser
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:42] did I was seeing it on this young
[1:10:46] man and I wondered how did you startling
[1:10:50] the ball like
[1:10:53] this he told me
[1:10:55] I I put all my time to watch his
[1:11:02] Styles praise the Lord I follow him up
[1:11:06] daily when there is a I follow
[1:11:12] him get
[1:11:14] sick now look at
[1:11:18] such if then we had the same Spirit on
[1:11:23] Christ that we want to be like
[1:11:27] him we would search his word which is
[1:11:31] in and once we search dently that
[1:11:38] word through that word of
[1:11:41] Christ then we shall act like him
[1:11:46] directly praise the lord we not act like
[1:11:49] him because all the time I'll be
[1:11:53] searching which style is going to use to
[1:11:56] today no if I am a believer now if I
[1:12:01] want to know which style Christ will
[1:12:03] Tove
[1:12:11] meise the
[1:12:13] Lord if I want Christ to bless me
[1:12:17] today I go in the word and see how he
[1:12:20] can do
[1:12:23] it and that way
[1:12:25] you not going to miss the blessings of
[1:12:28] God because the blessings always
[1:12:32] come praise the
[1:12:35] Lord like my young
[1:12:38] people God loves you so
[1:12:45] much he wants to destroy your
[1:12:51] life but if Rebecca didn't come to fet
[1:12:58] water would
[1:13:02] miss praise the Lord maybe she was
[1:13:06] disobedient not to do work at
[1:13:10] home you can get some
[1:13:12] water Mom I'm tired I'm doing
[1:13:20] studies you miss the
[1:13:23] bless so when God wants to bless
[1:13:27] us he wants us to be always
[1:13:31] present praise the Lord because his
[1:13:34] blessings are always
[1:13:38] plain praise the Lord and P preached one
[1:13:42] time and said the blessings of
[1:13:47] God they don't follow come with pain
[1:13:59] no praise the Lord
[1:14:02] blessings they come by believing his
[1:14:07] word praise the Lord because the prophet
[1:14:11] says revealed
[1:14:13] word in the pl view
[1:14:17] word in it it contains the blessings of
[1:14:23] God it contains the healing of
[1:14:26] God it it contains all that God
[1:14:32] is praise the
[1:14:34] Lord praise the
[1:14:38] Lord may the Lord bless
[1:14:41] [Applause]
[1:14:50] you allow
[1:14:52] me invite the pastor
[1:14:55] invite the
[1:15:00] pastor you're
[1:15:03] welcome prise the Lord amen
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:33] praise the
[1:15:34] Lord do you believe you in the unveiling
[1:15:36] of
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] God amen amen you see the unveiling was
[1:15:45] it's the unveiling God himself unveiling
[1:15:50] himself but today unveils himself in his
[1:15:54] own bride
[1:15:58] that right life you
[1:16:02] live is not your life it's God uning
[1:16:08] himself the seed on the inside
[1:16:11] there begins to be
[1:16:14] fruitful and all the
[1:16:17] fruit all the
[1:16:19] victories is the unveiling of
[1:16:22] God so we thank God
[1:16:25] for living in the days of the
[1:16:27] Fulfillment of the
[1:16:31] word and may the Lord bless our brother
[1:16:39] Dan you see that's a very good
[1:16:44] beginning when you see young men come
[1:16:48] up something to
[1:16:50] say you justk God for them
