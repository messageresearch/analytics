Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 up 13. and then we shall also read Ephesians 6 17. verse 12 says for the word of God for the word of God is quick and Powerful piercing given to the dividing a son of Saul and spirit and of the joints and the marrow and the designer of the thoughts and the intents of the heart is neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened up and Through The Eyes of him with whom we have to do foreign which is the word of God foreign right in between there they run the kids what we can share about the sword of the king Eventing Hebrews 4 12 was telling us that the word of God is quick it's powerful Germany and sharper than any two-edged swords meaning the word of God is a sword it's a sword which is sharper than any other sword and then we realize that it appears in through the soul the spirit and of the joints of the thoughts and the intents of the heart the prophet used to teach about the three the three parts of a human being the body the spirit and the Soul now we are being told that the word of God [Music] upon the physical man it will never leave you the same that is amen but that word of God goes deeper and it enters into the mind of a human being so that it changes the minds with our inner persons dealing with the way we think about situations it deals with the reasoning with the affections with the memories with everything that's just in our minds and it goes into the soul and when it reaches the song it gives us eternal life right inside there so it can give us the life on the physical problems can give us the Peace of the Mind handles [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] do you remember it how many remembers that is [Music] it landed in foreign [Laughter] [Music] [Music] and when he started God don't explain foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] the word of God he knows what is in the mind of a man foreign [Music] [Applause] and when the word of God is going foreign yes [Music] was the king in the Old Testament who showed Jesus Christ he was the son of David just as in the New Testament Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the son of death as a king in the Old Testament we see that he had a sword he was given a swords and the greatest sword which was put in the hands of Solomon the spirit of discernments [Applause] he was given a Discerning Spirit which was called wisdom when Solomon went in the presence of God foreign [Applause] a living challenge First Kings chapter 3 verse 19. this woman his child died in the night because she overlaid it [Music] and she arrives at midnight I took my son from the bed from the from bedside beside me um slept and laid it in her bosom and let other child in my bosomes and when I Rose in the morning my child behold it was dead but when I had considered it in the morning it was not myself today had this situation is in life foreign [Laughter] and and the locks that they use like nobody can know they can swear they can cry they can do anything but inside of bears the truth is God himself which is sharper than any other songs [Applause] [Music] foreign ERS cannot extract certain things from people that is and there is no method they can use it is when a man comes in the presence of God the word of God the Bible says only God knows the hearts of men but [Music] [Applause] [Applause] then the king answered [Applause] [Applause] foreign continue [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the word of God foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] do you love the Lord Amanda this is what Solomon had now you may wonder sometimes when we are here but what is that word they are talking about what is it anyway let me tell you when Solomon had it he didn't know what he had yeah it had been given unto him the word of God is quickened and it attacks a situation [Applause] foreign foreign and he said now bring the sword yeah and he had two women two churches a woman is a church but one of them has got a living child and the other one only has got a dead one of them run away and he has killed a child and now she's cleaning we are churches every church every church we are all confused whose son is this because everybody will cry according to what is inside your bed with your mouth [Applause] we have rejected the message and they crucified the message you cannot again have have him when you have killed him [Applause] foreign foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] so that we are able to decide so that we are maturity where you can look at them you claim to be an apostle you don't speak like the apostles in the time of Jesus and you know Moses foreign but the reality of it doesn't matter they deny the very word and what do we need now better that's a spiritual designers the church is now at the level of discernments belongs to the living child belongs to the real who are on burial seeds they cannot deny it is in the question is but the sword is above the child they have bounded a child and now they are saying the sword is going to determine well about what coaching about the child he was put in a question like this boy put in a question like this boy and the pirate said I have examined him and I don't find any food about it what shall I do with this Jesus yes foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] belong to some people yeah belong to some people there are some people worry about who wanted him alive and when he rose up again we are looking for him they went into the place I said where have you laid here and the angels came back and they sat on the tombs why are you looking for the leaders he is not there he has the reason us [Applause] [Music] but those who want the dead they are given their deaths he was condemned he was killed potentially was killed but then eventually there was somebody number four foreign before [Applause] and they continue with that Doctrine they said go and tell the people he's still dead because there's a group of people there is a woman who knew difference he's alive we have seen him he has come back yes [Music] they live in Jesus Jesus visited them yes you could have a weekend in your heart because of situations [Music] [Applause] foreign before they don't want the baby but their action is killed oh yeah they want to rotating things they want things that are spoiled let us let us all lose him let us away [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] there's something which cries inside of the heart of a Believer it means the spirit of God church and we have reached a level the sword of the King has come down and when the sword comes the Sheep must cry like the ship time do you love the Lord when I'm saying well amen amen why do you look for the living among us the Deadpool Mary she was looking around and the angel told me he's not there Jesus is not there he has already risen Jesus he's not there he has already risen up foreign do you love the Lord when I'm saying well amen I love him amen amen Solomon had the word of God if we have the word of God it will help us to design the Bible says let him that has got wisdom come to the name of the Beast it's the number of a man you need that wisdom what is that wisdom wisdom is discernment is when the word of God has come down together when there's coming a time when this Bibles will not be on the shelves or we will not be allowed to read them the Bible are not going to be ready to be hard but the pain is but which is in the Bible and that which is [Music] I am do you love the Lord when I'm saying well there was a woman the Bible says about the fame of solomoni we can read something in First Kings chapter 10 verse 1. please and when the queen of Shepherd of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with her questions with cameras that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was Camp Solomon she communed with him all that was in her heart is [Music] Solomon
