We even pray for our pastors and ministers. anoint him heavenly father for the services of the lord and bless us all together in the name of the lord Jesus to pray and ask this [music] &gt;&gt; amen you may be seated I greet in the name of our lord Jesus Christ [music] I know there are many caught up by the weather but we thank God for everything &gt;&gt; praise the name of our lord There are number of people I know are not around because of different reasons like those of brother Dann and the family they went yesterday they are attending today then brother Fred and the families are not around today praise the name of our lord and then our sister Janat Oo I remember she was admitted yesterday at Whispers Hospital in the evening because she was bleeding at home and she was just only left with two weeks to give birth. Unfortunately, by the time they reached hospital, [music] they did the scan and they found the child was lifeless. So they rushed her in the theater and then operated her. Thank God she came out. [music] &gt;&gt; But then our brother Richard and sister Juliet they had to travel that same night for the burial of that [music] you know still birth going to &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So now we just need to keep them in our prayers. You know our sister Janette is always not coming here at church [music] because she has a back problem. [music] You know because it is quite hard for her and so we just keep them in [music] our prayers that the grace of God may reach unto them to help them in that kind of situation. [music] Praise the name of our Lord. Our pastor is also not around today. He's preaching [music] in brother Andreas's church. [music] &gt;&gt; So just keep him in your prayers. Praise the name of our Lord. Do we have any visitors coming here for the first time? If you can raise up [music] your hand, you're welcome also. We happen to have you around today. [music] Let me just make Jonah stand up. J if you can stand up. [music] I hope you remember him. You can sit down. We were studying here at high. [music] There were three of them. There was David and Wliffe [music] and you know because of the world most of them to Campala. [music] David is still studying. He's finishing his course at [music] University Business School. But I can't tell much about weekl but we thank Jonah he now prays from lifeboat church and we thank God that [music] he has come back during these holidays. Praise the name of our Lord. We thank God for the grace he's giving us. Praise the name of our Lord. Day by day we can live for him. [music] &gt;&gt; We started the the morning exaltation on the seven seals. [music] On Monday we started on the seven seals that was on 22nd of December. [music] It may take us the whole of next year. Praise the name of our Lord because we are taking studies a big [music] volume and I would really call upon you to be interested. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; We had been before the other week we had finished the seven church age book. We started the seven church age book daily exaltations on 14th of April this year. it on December that was last week still [music] we took about 190 days [music] from Monday to Friday those who have been consistent every day I believe there's something that has been added to [music] you then there are those maybe they I don't care. I don't know. [music] But we need to take these things as what the Holy Spirit is guiding us into. [music] Praise the name of our Lord. You know the Bible says comes in an hour when you don't expect [music] it. So make sure that whatever God is releasing, [music] just receive it. be part of it. That's the same challenge Elijah was telling Elisha. He first told Elisha, "Stay here." Elisha said, "I'm not going to leave you. He go to another city. Stay here." Because he was telling him, "Stay here. God has sent me." Now for you to know what the mind of God is, follow the person God is revealing himself to. That's what Elisha was doing. Said if God has sent you there, then God is also interested in me being there. So he kept on following until he he crossed the Jordan and then [music] he told him, "Y what do you want me to do for you?" You don't ask him at Dan or at Jericho or Beth but until Jordan. And then we said, "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "I want a double portion of your spirit." And then Elijah told him, "If you see me being taken away," and that's what we need to do now. is to watch [music] to see every step the spirit is moving. Let me know what is the spirit speaking [music] to us on Wednesday. Let me know what is the spirit speaking to us on a Sunday. What is the spirit speaking to us in the radio program? What's the spirit speaking to us in the directation? Then you will not be able to miss. But sometimes when you are not there like when Thomas was not there Christ came in their mid and you know we are going to have a last right [music] anytime we don't maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe this week maybe next month maybe next year but what our responsibility is be always ready. Praise the name of the Lord. So I encourage you to keep on listening this morning exotation. [music] Take interest in these things. Praise the name of our Lord. [music] I don't if we are going to have a song reading of the word. Praise the name of our Lord. We just we can move being led by the spirit of [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; song says, "I have prayed for you." Amen. [music] Let's start at the chorus. And I have prayed for [music and singing] you that thy faith will not fail you. [music] It's perfect faith [singing] rooted in my love. [music] When the [singing] devil comes like a flood, [music] I will raise [singing] the standard of pray for you. Your faithfulness [music] will not fail. The devil comes to steal. [music] Kill [singing] and destroy [music] like a lion roaring, roaring. [music] You see the tempter. He's a [music] deceiver. And he's looking he's looking [music] for your soul. But I am [singing] praying for you that [music] I fear will not fear you. It's my [music and singing] faith rooted in my love. [music] When the [singing] devil comes like a rock, I will raise [singing and music] the stand that I pray for you. Your faithfulness will not [music and singing] fail. Trials and temptations, loss and despair [music] may pretend to knock [music] you off your mind. But at [music] your confession, oh strengthen your [singing] brother, strengthen your sister. I'm trying to [music] say, but I'm overthrown. No mercy. [music] But I have [singing] that. [music] [singing] It's nothing [music] in my [singing] life. [music] When the devil [singing] comes, I will raise the sun. [music and singing] Your faithfulness. [singing] [music] [singing] My [music] go [music and singing] for you. Your faithfulness [music] [singing] will not. And when the temple [music and singing] comes like a flood, I will raise the stand [singing] that I wait for you. [music] Your faithfulness will not fade. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've prayed for you. Praise the name of our Lord. Amen. For them. [applause] Amen. Amen. Amen. We have we happy to have sister Ruth around. Praise the name of our Lord. So this afternoon we are going to have a youth meeting those who are out of school. Then next Sunday we're also going to have two services. The afternoon will be for the youth in school. Praise the name of our Lord. On Wednesday is the last day of this year, 31st of December. So we are going to have an afternoon service. So come knowing that we are starting our service at 300 p.m. And then we are from the after the service we shall have the Lord's supper and foot washing we shall not have any service on Thursday which is the new year. Praise the name of the Lord. Then tomorrow the youth meetings in GA are starting. up to Thursday. Would encourage parents to support their children to be part of those meetings. Praise the name of our Lord. Just be part and serve the Lord can bless you. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us stand up the word. &gt;&gt; Let us pray first. Father, we thank you and give praise to your holy name. Now we approach the preaching of the word and you already told us the word of God is of no private interpretation but was given by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And we pray that the same Holy Spirit will come and take this word and put it in our hearts that may be able to bear fruit, Lord. And we pray that your grace be upon every one of us this morning. Even those who are on online services, your grace may reach out unto them far that each and every one of us may be converted that we may be like our Lord Jesus Christ. We love you and we bless you. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we go to Luke chapter 22 verse 31 and verse 32. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Luke 20:31-32 the Bible says and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. morning. But I've prayed for you that your faith fail not, and when you are converted, strengthen thy brethren. May God blessing of his word may be seated. So by the grace of God I want to preach on the subject when you are converted. Praise the name of our Lord. when you are converted. &gt;&gt; Now to be converted is to be turned into another person. Praise the name of our Lord. be turned. Now like for example when prophet Samuel when he met Saul and he knew that Saul was the one God has chosen to be the king over Israel. So he anointed Saul. And when he anointed Saul, he told him, "As you go, you will meet people prophesying. And when you meet them and they are prophesying, the spirit of God will come upon you and then you will become another person." Praise the name of our Lord. I just want to pick up that scripture. So let us go to the book of 1 Samuel. Praise the name of our Lord. In the book of 1 Samuel and then we go to chapter 10 and verse one. So the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said, "It is not, is it not because the Lord has anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance? And then in verse five, he said, "After that, you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines, and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets, coming down from the high place with a pulsey and a tablet and a pipe and a harp before them. And they shall prophesy. and the spirit of the Lord shall come upon you And you shall prophesy with them, and you shall be turned into another man. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "You shall be turned into another man." So conversion comes by the spirit of God. In other words, you have allowed the spirit of God to come and take charge over your life. Praise the name of the Lord. When the Bible tells us in John chapter 3, And then in verse six, the Bible says that which is born of flesh is flesh. And that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Now our first birth, we were born of flesh. We were born of the will of our parents. You were born as flesh and blood. That's the first birth. That's who we are in in this world now. We were born here on earth. And as you were born here on earth, you know, you partake of the physical things because you were born flesh and blood. So then you have the earth as your home. You have your inheritance here on earth. like in any family you find a father saying I'm going to give this land to my children this property to my children but now that is born of flesh but then you see that our first birth says that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the woman is over a few days. So our first bus is of a few days and the Bible says it is full of trouble. Praise the name of our Lord. It doesn't matter where you have been born. Whether you born in a gola, there is trouble in a golof. Whether you are born in a white man's land, praise the name of our Lord. I need to go to America. We need to go to America. They have similar troubles like we have. Praise the name of Lord. They have similar troubles. And you know the sun is the same. Praise the name of So when you go there, you're not going to another heaven, another world. The systems may be different but they are grass is also green like ours. Praise the name of it's the same son. They also cry for the rain to rain. Oh when is it raining? And then the problem there rains are so dangerous. Sometimes they have things like typhoon, terrible winds which can move at 300 km per hour. The Bible says he that is born of a woman is of a few days and is full of trouble. Whether you're born in a rich man's house, or born in a poor man's house or you are born as a prince or you are born as a laborer's child. Travel is everywhere. Praise the name of Lord. So that's why we need to desire the new birth. So he says that which is born of flesh is flesh. And that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Now to be born of the spirit is the new birth is our conversion. To be born of the holy spirit. And then he the prophet was telling saul that when the spirit of god comes upon you be turned into another man. And then here Jesus was telling Peter when you are converted. So he was showing him that the spirit is going to come down and you are going to be born of the spirit. Now when you are born of the spirit of God, you are born from above. Praise the name of our Lord. When you are born of the spirit of God, you are born from above. And that should be our desire. When you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior, don't stop at that. When you go into water baptism, don't stop at that. When you come to church, don't stop at that. Go further. Make sure that you are born from heaven. Praise the name of our Lord. That should always be our desire when you come into the presence of God. Lord, I want to be born again. Lord, I want to be converted. Lord, I want a new life. I want to become a new creation. That's something which should bring comfort to your soul. Something that should bring rest. Praise the name of our Lord. rest where it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth. That should be our desire every day. But then the challenge that we have nowadays is people start the journey and they walk a little and they get contented. I'm already in a message believer. I know who the prophet of the hour is. I know this. I know this. That's my church. That is my pastor. And then they relax at that. But you really need to go further than that and have a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. Without a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, you can never be born again. You can never be converted. And when you are not converted, you are not born from above. Praise the name of God. Just the way the Bible says that our citizenship in Philippians 3:20, our citizenship is in heaven. Now, how do you say you're a city of citizen of heaven when you have never been born there? Praise the name of the Lord. You know, you can't just go to somebody's house because he's your friend and I want my inheritance. &gt;&gt; This man is a cheat then even you how do you going to heaven? Is it your home? [laughter] So if you have not been born from above, you can't go in heaven because it's not your inheritance. It's not your citizenship. So you must first be born from above. &gt;&gt; Then you can say that I'm going home. &gt;&gt; That's what says you read Philippians 3:20. &gt;&gt; Our heaven Philippians 3:20. Our conversation is in heaven. Our citizenship is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Our citizenship is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Now you see the mix. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So if our citizenship is in heaven, you must be born in heaven. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are talking about this morning. Be born in heaven. &gt;&gt; And it's not difficult. Praise the name of our Lord. There is not a special labor somewhere that now maybe this is the church where there is a labor and maybe this is the special midwife no once you here conversion can take place. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go into this message. He says, "So did the apostles in the message why it had to be the shepherds. So did the apostles. They wasn't born again until they received the Holy Spirit. They wasn't even converted until they had received the Holy Spirit. You remember the night before betroal, just before betrayal took place, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "When you are converted, then strengthen thy brethren." And Peter had followed him for three years and a half and had cast out devils and healed the sick and preached the gospel and still according to the word was not even converted. Praise the name of our Lord. If I can get the mic. &gt;&gt; So he says Peter preached the word. Peter &gt;&gt; was praying for the sick and they were being healed. Peter was casting out devils and still he was not even converted. And you find many people in that kind of situation. I'm a message believer and they are contented with that. Now when you ask them about their personal relationship with Christ, they're not sure. They're not sure. They're just afraid. You know it's one way or another reject him at a particular point and they deny him at a particular point and they continue moving on in their life and then at the death bed they come to their normal senses. What shall I do? When they come to the reality life here on earth is over or it's coming to an end but ahead of me. It's not clear. What a terrible condition. They get in a situation of a fearful situation, you know, kind of getting trying to see that the the darkness ahead. They find there is horror ahead coming back to their senses. But then sometimes it can be late. So now the preaching of the word is meant to make you awakened to find out where he is in your life. Where have you left him? Praise the name of Lord. Have you left him by not coming to church? Say Lord help me to improve in this area. Have you left him in not praying to him? Have you left him in not reading the word? Have you left him in not living a Christian life? Have you left him? You know, you're not doing the things which are necessary. Lord, have mercy upon him. Like David, he committed adultery. He killed and it went a whole year and he supposed with God. And many people get themselves in those kind of conditions, a whole year, a whole long period, a whole long stretch. But God who is rich in mercy, sent the prophet. And David was contented in himself righteousness. When the prophet told him, there was a man a rich man and a poor man. And then the rich man went and took the poor man's sheep. David in his own self righteousness, he judged the rich man. He needs to be killed. And sometimes people can get in that condition. Me, I'm a message believer. I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I go to church. I do every obligation I'm required to like the richer. I've done everything. What lucketh I then the Lord told him. Go and sell what you have and then give to the poor and then come and follow me. And the Bible says that was a hard saying. And sometimes you may also be hearing things are hard. Me a youth to put on long dresses. That's a hard saying. They will call me Judger, &gt;&gt; old fashioned. &gt;&gt; So, and then some of our sisters, you not know how they dress, you go to where they work. If you want to know how they dress, you go where they work on Monday like tomorrow. They have special wardrobe for work. tight, short with a slit, very comfortable. And they move with the smallest in the back, one which matches that clo. She goes to the bathroom &gt;&gt; and then puts it around &gt;&gt; or hides behind and then grabs herself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then you start wondering is your clothes stained or what? It has been torn but is making a show up. How about before God? the richer. It was a hard saying and some of the word you may say. It was a hard saying. Now you know the rich young ruler's problem was the things he had was the things he had where the hindrance to have a personal relationship with God. And you may have also some situations in your life which are a hindrance to your relationship with God. When Jesus went to the house of Zachas, the Bible says he was a rich man. He was a tax collector. But Jesus never told him, "Leave your job." Jesus never told him, "Sell all that you have." Jesus never told him, "Give what you have to the poor." His heart, the heart of Zakas was fully willing to receive the Lord Jesus. Until when Jesus went to his home, the man got in a station of repentance. Yes, this he gives this one here. I'm going to pay back this. I'm going to pay back this. What was it? It was the presence of God that inter it brought him to conviction and desire to do what was right. And then the Lord Jesus says today his salvation come into the world. Praise the name of our Lord. So how about you? Praise the name of our Lord. Peter, they were walking with the Lord Jesus Christ. They were doing the miracles, doing the signs, preaching the gospel. But Peter denied the Lord Jesus Christ. You can also be in the same condition. When he's not inside of you, you can deny him. When he's not inside of you, you'll forget him. For Judah says, "It was he sold him. because he was not inside here. Sold him. &gt;&gt; Now you look at the situation of Peter. Let us go to Matthew chapter 26 and verse 69. Matthew 26 verse 69. Now Peter sat without in the palace, and the damel came unto him, saying, Tho also was with Jesus of Galilee. But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you say. Peter was afraid to identify himself with Christ. And there are people who are afraid to identify with the Lord at their places of work. They are afraid. Maybe they are sitting in a meeting who can pray for us down. Or when they know there's an item of prayer, that's the time to excuse to go to the toilet. Then when they hear they finished then he comes back. &gt;&gt; Peter afraid &gt;&gt; to identify himself with Christ. When you are not converted, that's what happens. When you are not converted, you'll forget God. You'll deny him. You can even sell him. When you are not converted, now the Lord was telling Peter, when you are converted, he was calling him to a higher level. He was calling him to a better relationship. I want you to be converted and when you are converted you will strengthen your breath. Praise the name of our Lord. So when he denied that one is finished. He will never bother me again. And he sat there watching. Then again another came and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazare. You know, there are some trials God permits to come your way to make you understand your condition. &gt;&gt; He brings it back. I thought I'd finished this thing. You didn't finish it well. So, he brings it back again. This &gt;&gt; you're not learning. He denied again. Then he pretended and again he denied with an oath. I don't know the man. And after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for even the way you speak shows you're one of them. Then he began to cuss and to swear saying, "I don't know the man." And immediately the coke crew. When you are not converted, you live in I don't understand what you are saying. Aren't you the one who prays from? It's a mistaken identity. Deny. And that's what the devil wants you to do. He wants you to deny your faith. He wants you to deny your relationship with God. So that's why we need to desire to be converted. When you are converted, you can't deny it. I am the man. &gt;&gt; I'm the one. It is me who walked who walked with him. The Bible says &gt;&gt; verse 75, &gt;&gt; "And he began it to curse and swear, saying, I know not the man." And immediately the crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the crew, "Thou shalt deny me thrice." And he went out and wept bitterly. Now Peter here is not even being beaten but is denying him because he's not converted. So you can also deny the word of God in your daily walk. You deny the word of God to guide you in your living. You deny the word of God to deny you the way you do work, your work. You deny the word of God to guide you at your school. You deny the word of God to make you guide you at your home. You know, you want to do the things like the way the world does. You are denying him. You are ashamed of him. You feel shy about him. You feel offended because of him. I don't want my friends to know that I'm not know that the devil is taking a hold of you because your protection is your confession. The moment you deny him, the devil has taken a hold of you. So now the Bible here says Peter went out and wept bitterly. Christ had given him a sign when the coke crows. And when the co Jesus turned his eyes, looked at Peter, Peter looked at him. He remembered and he went out and wept bitterly. Now he was not yet converted. That's why he would do all those kind of things. So he told him when you are converted. Now we see in the scriptures they were preaching the gospel and people were becoming born again. So in the book of acts they went and arrested Peter and the rest of them. And when they arrested them they took them and started beating them. and told him don't speak again in the name of Jesus. Peter because he was converted. He told them should we fear you or we fear God? They were here. He was beaten there. They didn't beat him but he was denied. But after conversion when he was beaten he wouldn't deny him. Why? He was inside of him. Praise the name of our Lord. And that should be our desire. Lord, enter inside of me. That even when I'm at my place of work, it doesn't matter. The Lord is with me. Praise the name of our Lord. Like Daniel, at his place of work, they made the Lord was funny. But Daniel said, "I'm going to stand by my conviction." And then they came and arrested him thinking that he would change. They wouldn't pull it out of Daniel. They put him in the lion's den. Praise the name of our Lord. The three Hebrew children thrown in the fire. But what was inside of them was a living reality. And that should be the same thing with us. that when you are faced with challenges, when you are faced with temptation, when you are faced with trials, let God remain God in your life. Have a true testimony about it. Praise the name of our Lord, not a changing situation. Now, in the message, God's provided way of healing. He says, &gt;&gt; "Notice, &gt;&gt; no man can have faithful healing until it is revealed to him by the Holy Spirit. that is going to be well. You might stumble at it. You might go through life living a good Christian life. You might belong to some church. You might have fine membership. You might be a moral character and all of that. But brother, &gt;&gt; that still isn't Christianity. Christianity is when the Holy Ghost has taken full possession of you and you are led by the Holy Spirit, no matter how good, how moral, how good a church member, Kane was as good as any church member. Cain was as good as any church member. So Esau was fine cultured gentleman was Cain very religious believed in God made sacrifice built a church altar done all things that is religious and God refused him. Then he said, "Peter has been justified and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. He even preached the gospel." But Jesus told him, "After you are converted, strengthen your brethren, after you are converted." Conversion is the Holy Spirit that moves the old nature out and the new nature comes in which is the Holy Ghost. And when a man has truly been born of the spirit of God, he has everlasting life. And that's where we all need to get to. I need to be changed. I need to be born again. I need to be filled with the Holy Spirit. I'm not contented about my own life, but I want the Holy Spirit to come down in my life. And it's not difficult. He needs you a total surrender. Just give yourself to him. You know, like God was telling Cain, if you do well, you'll be accepted. It's the same thing to us. If you can do well, you can say, "Lord, I need your Holy Spirit. I need a change of my heart. I need to be born again." And he does it. Praise the name of Lord. When Isaiah said a man clean, then the angel, the saraphim came and he was helped in his condition. Praise the name of the Lord. You also need to get into that kind of situation. where you can have a genuine repentance. A repentance. The Bible says when you have a contrite and broken heart in Psalms chapter 51 and then verse 17 the Bible says &gt;&gt; the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, you will not despise. He says a contrite broken heart. That's what we need. Praise the name of the Lord. You have that heart contrite, broken. He says God will not despise. It should take your own interest. Be desirous of it. Like Cornerius. Praise the name of our Lord. We can talk about different conversions. Let us look at Cornarius's in Acts 10:33. that the Bible says when Cornerius was praying and fasting, [clears throat] when Cornelius was praying and fasting and then an angel came down from heaven. Now you may say, I wish God would send me also that angel. But you're hearing the word. Praise the name of the Lord. If I was there in the times of the prophet begins to discern. Oh, you've been looking for the Holy Spirit. You're going to get him. We have the word here. Cornelius the angel came down the angel told him call for Peter &gt;&gt; and Cornelius was faithful. He called for Peter and then invited his family and friends and told them what has happened. And then also came expecting and then they were waiting. And then Cornelius makes this confession in verse 33. And that should be our condition every time when we come into the presence of God. When you are coming to church, don't come just to see another person or to be seen, but come with a heart ready saying like Cornarius immediately. Therefore, I sent to thee, and you have done well that you are come. Now therefore are we all here? He said now are we all here not in my house not in church but in the presence of God. That's the respect you should come with to church. Coming before the presence of God. And so he says we are here in the presence of God. To do what? To hear not what we want to hear. Begin talk about all that God has commanded you. Whenever we come to church, that should be our desire to come to hear all a full course menu, &gt;&gt; full course, balanced diet, you know, good meal, there are sweet things and bitter things. &gt;&gt; So when you reach those bitter berries, It will make you healthy when you reach where there is. Sometimes they they can even give you aloe vera. Drink it. It will make you good. Praise the name of the Lord. It will p some funny spirits. to p some bad thoughts to p some things here take it said whatever they will put on the table for me I'm going to eat maybe KFC chicken I will not look for KFC you only take the line of KFC here But there also other things somewhere here which are he says we are here to hear all that's the attitude that God wants us speak praise the name of our lord and then the bible says then Peter opened his mouth is a respect of no person, but in every nation, he that fearth him and workketh righteousness is acceptable with him. Praise the name of. So you must come with that kind of condition if you are to be converted. Heart attitude, you know, prepared. Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm waiting upon you. Lord, I need the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lord, I need my heart to be changed. Lord, you know how you can help me. I don't know how I can help myself, but you can help me and we are surrendering myself to you. Praise the name of the Lord. And then the Bible says while Peter spoke these words because the hearts were already broken hearts. They were contrite hearts. The Holy Ghost just came down, converted them, filled them. Praise the name of the Lord. It's all about your preparation before the Lord. How are you ready? Look at the conversion of Saul. When Jesus revealed himself to Saul said, "I am Jesus." He became blind. They just took him to the city. And from that time, he started repenting. God, I have wasted your church. How I witnessed the death of Stevie. I give this three days praying and fasting. And then God tells Anas the prophet in the same city and tells him, "I'm sending you a man called Saul of Tarsis. He's in this house. He is praying." God recognized the desire of Saul. that he no longer wanted to live in that Pharisee life. He was no longer considering his Pharisee religion. who's no longer considering the righteousness of the Lord and say Lord have mercy upon him and then Lord tellas go to him lay your hands on him his eyes will open and you receive the Holy Spirit it was not difficult so when you hear the word of God how are you interested in the word how does the word create that thirsting for more of God in your life because the word of God is a deep calling to you that I'm here. I want to fill you. And the Bible says deep calls to the deep. So the word creates the deep. When you hear the word, it brings conviction. It causes a desire in your heart like when Cornelius heard. The angel telling him, "Send for Peter." He went on waiting praying, "Oh God, may you bring him safely. Lord, help my family. May they know what what you've made yourself known to." And when Peter came, he said, "We are here. I'm not in any rush to go anywhere [clears throat] like today you know there is a African football championship. &gt;&gt; Now you can start looking at the time. No he was not in that rush. meeting is the youth meeting in the evening. Cornelius was not in that rush. He was ready to face it to surrender everything. Lord, I'm just here. Praise the name of our Lord. So, he was not timing himself. Do you know if it comes to I've given God until 1:00 and God is humble. They will say okay and brother Brennham says whatever you give him 10 minutes 5 minutes he takes it but you're doing yourself harm why don't you wait for the Lord say Lord I want to hear all your counel you know when you come into the presence of God you just don't want to leave that place because it is so Nice brother. Brandon was telling the people he was discerning. There's some strange feeling you're feeling. Sweet, calm, settled. Then he says that is his presence and that should be something which we experience every day in our lives because he's inside of you. You don't feel good because you have money. But the presence of God in your life will make you be settled. You know, be calm even in the midst of a lot of troubles around your life. So said we are here. He was ready to be converted. soul he waited say Lord you've revealed this to me change me I want to have that life like that life of Steven I remember when I was when they were stoning him said Lord I won't put it to their church and then brother Brandham says those words of Stephen kept on haunting Paul, how do you get a person you are killing and is praying for you good? Now, we need to come back to ourselves. Do you love your enemies? Praise the name of our Lord. That's a test. You want to check if you have the Holy Spirit? Do you love your enemies? Just that I will not tell you that you have to jump high. I will not tell that you have to speak in tong &gt;&gt; but just to come at the end here. Do you have the life? Praise the name of the Lord. So Paul was busy waiting on the Lord. And can you imagine the way God does things? This man was blind but he was seeing a vision and he has coming to lay his hand on him praying for him. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to be converted. Soul had to go and face it. Take interest yourself. Spend time with God as an individual. Praise the name of the Lord. Take time as an individual. It may be at your home. It may any place you find it is convenient for you. Say, "Lord, I'm not interested in this life anymore. A life which is not true. Praise the name of our Lord." So Paul waited. There was a deep that was created in him when he met the Lord Jesus Christ. A deep was created in him to desire more of Christ. And when we come to church, a deep is always created before us. And when that deep is created, there is a deep to fulfill that. And that's to take opportunity of that. Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm here. Like Cornerius, I'm here to hear all to obey what you've told us deep calling to the deep. So the word of God, when you hear the word of God, it convicts you. It creates a deep in your heart. It creates a yearning in your life, a thirsting in your life. And then you thirst after righteousness. And then the Bible says in verse 56 that when you get that thirst, you'll be filled. That's what the Lord does. So he says when you are converted, what does it mean? He wants to convert you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. He wants to change your life. So you just allow him to take charge over your life. Praise the name of our Lord because of time. We may not go into many things. But now in the message the future home of the of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. Brother Brandham says here, "Notice how God makes it plain to us." Then he says, &gt;&gt; "When I see this and see that since a boy, first time I ever I first time ever Christ dealt with me, I've still always taught those three stages of grace." So he's talking about grace. It is the same grace of God that takes you through justification. It's the same grace of God that takes you through sanctification. And it's the same grace of God that brings the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's how the Lord does. So he himself comes. What you need to do is to allow him to move you. He brings conviction in your heart. What he desires is your obedience. Lord, I'm here. Lord, I'm available. Tell me what to do and I'm going to do it. That's how conversion comes. Is you yielding yourself to the Lord. He says, "Repent. Repent. Be baptized. Be baptized. Obey the word. Obey the word. It's a response which is waiting upon us. And then you are converted. Then he says now the first step is repentance towards God. And then follows after that is water baptism. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. See water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine to remit past sins that has nothing to do with the future sin. Now I want to explain this here. Now when you repent and you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, he takes care removes all your past sin from the time you were born at the time you accepting. But then the challenge is you still have the old nature which made you do the old sins. And this is where he wants to deal with after you are justified. So he comes in sanctification and we are sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ. So he comes to see that he destroys that nature that life that made you desire to do things which are wrong. So then you go through sanctification. And now when you are sanctified is making you ready to be ready for service. Now when you are sanctified you are set aside for the service whose service God is very service who sanctifies you Christ himself. So it is the same spirit of God that justifies you by hearing the word of God. When you believe that word, you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, then you are justified. And then when you continue, Jesus told them, if you continue in my word, so in other words, you've started a journey of no retreat. You've already crossed the Red Sea. Don't desire the things of Egypt. But in the wilderness, he was teaching them to depend upon him. That's all the whole mission of the wilderness. When they were crossing the Red Sea, there was a lot of water. Praise the name of our Lord. They will even go and fetch the water using their hand. You know the water was the wall. So you can put your hand in it car. But 3 days there was no water. He was teaching them to depend on him. And that's the Christian journey. God teaches you to depend upon him. That's the Christian journey. Not your ability, not your strength, but the grace of God that comes. So he says they have not learned my ways. So when you come to Christ, he wants you to honestly depend upon him. like the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, I can do nothing except what I see my father do. So he was always depending on the leadership of the Lord. What the Holy Spirit was showing him then he does it. Praise the name of our Lord. When he goes to the pool of Basha, he gets there too many people are sick and in terrible condition. He had the power to heal all of them. But the father only wanted one person. So he went to that person. Rise up. The other man was giving excuses. You know whenever the angel comes, I'm not fast to be into the water. Another person goes after me. For many years I've been here. You stand. &gt;&gt; The man stood. Then others were wondering &gt;&gt; what if what &gt;&gt; it was not for them. &gt;&gt; Paul was walking with many people temple guards but Christ only revealed himself to Saul went back to do their work and they say we don't know what has become of this man we're moving with. We just saw him fall down. We had I just don't understand. We shouldn't be like those people. But when we come to Christ, let us be like Cornelius. Lord, I have come to hear all that. Praise the name of our Lord. So it is the same Holy Spirit that takes us through justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Spirit. like we were seeing on Wednesday, Peter was telling them this promise. He didn't tell them that promise, but he was telling them it is here with us. Praise the name of our Lord. And I can tell you the same thing. The Holy Spirit is here with us. Praise the name of our Lord ready enter any heart that will receive you only need say Lord I give myself over to you take charge over my life he told them when you are converted that should be our desire Lord change me Lord deliver me Lord wash me from all unrighteousness from all uncleanness make me new. Is that your heart there this day? May God bless you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us stand up and sing that song. I surrender. &gt;&gt; Oh to Jesus I surrender and see that you die to yourself. You know you die to your needs. You die to your desires and say Lord I only need your desire. I only need your spirit. Brother Brham says died on the alt of his sacrifice. Abel died on the out of his sacrifice. You also need to die to the out of our sacrifice. Die to yourself. Die to your desires. Say Lord. It's only you that I need in praise the name of all [singing] to Jesus. I surrender all to him I freely. Halleluah. I will ever love and trust in [music] his presence.
