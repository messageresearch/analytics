[40:23] continue to bless
[40:26] you in your
[40:29] undertakings as you
[40:31] work to build the kingdom of
[40:34] God Amen so we are just short of
[40:39] time you know one
[40:42] time when brother Bram went to the
[40:45] Pentecostal people for the first
[40:49] time there was an
[40:53] Minister that was
[40:55] preaching and he preached out into
[40:59] eternity back here on so he
[41:03] screamed and
[41:05] said you don't have enough space for me
[41:08] to
[41:09] preach and we want to say we don't have
[41:13] enough time for brother Andreas to
[41:17] preach so we shall not go into the
[41:20] merits of introducing
[41:22] everybody but together let us just say
[41:25] God bless you
[41:28] amen these are the Servants of
[41:31] God they every week on the
[41:35] field they are doing the work of God so
[41:39] keep praying for them amen because it's
[41:43] very
[41:44] necessary I normally use my
[41:47] statement keep the prayers
[41:50] coming amen we like that so God bless
[41:54] you thank you for being present
[41:58] amen amen uh we don't
[42:01] have oh brother Steven St yeah God bless
[42:05] you amen we appreciate you being
[42:10] here amen amen we thank
[42:13] God and uh we shall just ask my
[42:18] brother to come right
[42:21] away and speak to the
[42:23] people what God has put upon his heart
[42:28] God bless you all do you love
[42:29] him let's help our brother preach
[42:47] okay amen amen
[43:02] yes the Lord is
[43:04] good praise the lord we serve a
[43:07] wonderful
[43:08] [Music]
[43:10] God that is actually my uh my uh
[43:14] introduction many
[43:16] times this is my introduction many
[43:21] times uh that what brother Steven just
[43:24] spoke of
[43:27] uh the time is always not my
[43:32] friend
[43:35] so amen so uh but I'm I'm we're looking
[43:39] forward for the
[43:44] time when we don't have to go
[43:47] home when we sit
[43:50] together spend eternity
[43:55] together I don't think I will preach
[43:59] there I I think we will have Fellowship
[44:04] together amen so but that
[44:07] Fellowship was brothers and
[44:10] sisters that
[44:13] Fellowship there's there's no big no
[44:19] small an important man
[44:24] unimportant because in in Christ
[44:27] we are all the
[44:28] same there's
[44:32] neither here on Earth we still have the
[44:36] difference as long as we are in these
[44:38] bodies we will have even the difference
[44:41] between man and
[44:43] woman when you come on the to the other
[44:46] side it's just brothers and
[44:49] sisters and as the Bible say in Christ
[44:54] there's neither neither male nor female
[44:58] in Christ We Are All
[45:00] One amen what a great time we are going
[45:06] to a time where time where time doesn't
[45:12] matter amen a time where time is not so
[45:17] important amen a time when we don't have
[45:21] to look at the
[45:24] time what what we are facing
[45:28] amen and we believe the Lord has blessed
[45:30] us so
[45:32] much amen and we want to give all the
[45:35] preeminence to the
[45:38] word in the beginning was the
[45:41] word in the word was with God and the
[45:44] Word was
[45:45] God and finally that word became flesh
[45:48] and dwelt Among
[45:51] Us amen that word we are speaking
[45:54] of Amen not the Bible not the
[45:57] book but in the
[46:00] beginning and in the beginning was the
[46:03] words and if you are
[46:06] Eternal as brother R would
[46:08] say if you are
[46:10] Eternal you was with him in the
[46:14] beginning
[46:15] amen eternal
[46:19] life eternal life this is who you really
[46:25] were you know brother made a
[46:28] statement he said he said there was a
[46:32] time when we knew
[46:35] that but our mind is darkened to that
[46:42] now we we come here with
[46:47] amnesia you know Amnesia brother venam
[46:51] said comes by different things comes by
[46:55] different things
[46:57] it comes by a
[46:59] shock and your
[47:02] birth was a shock to
[47:04] you so you came here to
[47:07] Earth with total
[47:12] Amnesia amen amen you didn't know that's
[47:17] why you need to be born
[47:20] again something needs to wake
[47:24] up the real you needs to wake up
[47:27] [Music]
[47:30] amen but brother random said there was a
[47:34] time when you knew who you
[47:39] were amen hallelujah where are we coming
[47:44] from what what destination do we
[47:50] have amen
[47:53] hallelujah and when when you know where
[47:55] you come from
[47:58] then you know where you are
[48:01] going Hallelujah maybe we are not there
[48:05] yet we are still in the body of
[48:09] Flesh when we know where we are come
[48:12] from then we know where we are
[48:15] going we come from the mind of
[48:18] God and we come come back
[48:23] expressed we don't go back into the mind
[48:25] of God
[48:27] but we go back to be
[48:31] expressed my own son that was in my
[48:35] loins will never go back into my
[48:38] loins but he will be he will be with me
[48:42] he's constantly
[48:45] there this we will be in
[48:48] eternity we don't go back to the mind of
[48:51] God we go back to be expressed
[48:57] with
[49:00] him what a future we
[49:03] have this world is falling
[49:07] apart this world is falling
[49:10] apart but Jesus was praying for another
[49:15] world Hallelujah Jesus was praying for
[49:18] another
[49:19] world he said he said to in John he said
[49:23] my little
[49:25] children the Bible would say say the
[49:28] Bible would say so does God love the
[49:32] world that he gave his only begotten
[49:36] son what world does God
[49:41] love hallelujah what world does God
[49:46] love amen when John tells
[49:50] us little
[49:51] children if you love the world and the
[49:55] things of the world the love of God is
[49:57] not in
[49:59] you so what world is it that God
[50:03] loves you are the world that God
[50:08] L amen for you he gave his only
[50:16] begotten and what kind of a world we go
[50:19] back
[50:21] to a world of brothers and sisters
[50:27] world a world of the True
[50:30] Believers what a great time that we are
[50:34] facing God bless you amen amen it's
[50:38] wonderful to when you
[50:40] start start and the pool is
[50:44] there I'm very attentive to the
[50:48] pool sometimes ruins the
[50:52] service but I'm not sometimes I'm
[50:56] sometimes I want
[50:57] Wonder but I say Lord what can I do if
[51:01] you just feel the spirit pulling in that
[51:04] direction what what shall we do amen we
[51:08] just
[51:09] believe that is a deep calling to the
[51:12] de and there's if there's a deep
[51:16] calling there's a deep
[51:19] respond believe that there's there's a
[51:23] deep calling
[51:25] now a call from deep
[51:29] inside a call from the from the real
[51:34] you when the deep is calling to the
[51:38] Deep Hallelujah then the Deep will
[51:45] respond and I believe that God is really
[51:48] moving in a mighty
[51:50] way God bless you let us stand this
[51:53] evening and uh we just want to go quick
[51:56] back read only one scripture
[52:00] Genesis we want to uh we want to look if
[52:04] we can continue a little
[52:08] bit we want to speak on the impact of
[52:10] restored
[52:19] relationship on our
[52:22] inheritance amen the Promised Land
[52:26] Genesis
[52:27] 5 and he just said to you this
[52:30] morning just keep that this will be our
[52:33] finally closing scripture this
[52:38] evening as the Lord
[52:41] permits amen Genesis
[52:47] 5:24 very wonderful
[52:50] scripture and Enoch walked with
[52:54] God and he was not
[53:03] for God took
[53:07] him amen let us pray together Heavenly
[53:12] Father what a great
[53:16] story and we know what Enoch is a type
[53:20] of Enoch lived his
[53:23] life and maybe he didn't know that we
[53:26] would speak about him
[53:30] today but you put him there he just went
[53:33] there he lived his
[53:35] life as an
[53:38] example for us to
[53:40] come so that we can come at the final
[53:44] stage the sevens from the second
[53:48] [Music]
[53:49] Adam we know how the Rapture will take
[53:54] place father we pray
[53:57] just take us behind the holy behind the
[54:02] veil take us into the holies of
[54:06] holies and may the curtains fall behind
[54:10] us and father let me May each and
[54:15] everyone have Fellowship relationship
[54:17] with
[54:20] you we ask for your honor and For Your
[54:24] Glory in Jesus Christ
[54:28] amen amen amen God bless you may be
[54:31] seated um as I maybe want to start with
[54:35] a with a again with a statement of
[54:37] brother
[54:40] Brenham what he does in the
[54:43] Rapture brother Ram in the Rapture
[54:46] message he made like in any other
[54:49] messages also makes a very very profound
[54:54] statement now the rapture
[54:58] is only he
[54:59] said is the rapture that we are talking
[55:03] about is only for the
[55:08] bride amen the re is only for the
[55:14] bride hallelujah hallelujah so the
[55:18] church can do what they
[55:22] want they can be as nice as they try
[55:29] try you cannot earn to be in the
[55:36] Rapture you cannot work yourself in the
[55:42] Rapture remember as we said this as we
[55:44] said this
[55:45] morning they came people to
[55:48] him and they told him have we not done
[55:52] this in your
[55:53] name we have done everything in your
[55:56] name
[55:57] we have preached in your name we have
[55:59] cast out even de devils in your name and
[56:02] Jesus would look to him them and he said
[56:05] I don't even know
[56:07] you so the
[56:09] Rapture is only for the
[56:13] bride I want to say that
[56:16] again it's nice and remember as we speak
[56:20] of foolish and wise
[56:24] virgin amen the the foolish
[56:28] virgins they were
[56:31] virgins but the others were wise and
[56:33] they were
[56:36] foolish but they were
[56:38] virgins that means that means they had
[56:41] kept themselves
[56:45] clean you understand that they have they
[56:48] have done also a lot in their
[56:51] life they refused the
[56:54] wrong and it is wonderful if you refuse
[56:58] wrong but if you just refuse
[57:01] wrong you never make a mistake in your
[57:04] life does is not the qualification to go
[57:07] in the
[57:08] [Music]
[57:13] Rapture
[57:15] hallelujah amen amen that's not the
[57:18] qualification
[57:18] [Music]
[57:20] to we should do our
[57:23] best because we love him
[57:27] there will be good people in
[57:32] hell and there will be bad people in
[57:42] heaven remember the Rich Young
[57:45] Ruler he was a very very good
[57:49] boy
[57:51] respectful I have done everything from
[57:54] my you
[57:57] Jesus loved him because he was a nice
[58:00] boy but he opened his eyes in
[58:08] Hell amen the prophet showed
[58:11] us that it was this Rich Young
[58:15] Ruler that opened his eyes in
[58:19] hell and we read the the we read the the
[58:23] wonderful example of Matthew 22
[58:28] when when a king was
[58:30] making wedding for his
[58:34] son again like this
[58:36] morning it was not the son making
[58:38] wedding for
[58:40] himself it was the father making wedding
[58:44] for his
[58:45] son amen again you see the principle
[58:48] again through all the
[58:50] Bible always the
[58:53] father because it is unveiling of
[58:57] God God wants to unveil
[59:00] himself God needs a church God needs a
[59:05] bride where the head is Jesus
[59:09] Christ like the head was
[59:12] Adam amen but Adam needed the
[59:16] woman God said it is not good that man
[59:21] is why because if man is
[59:24] alone can Express
[59:27] himself man is
[59:29] alone he cannot manif he cannot
[59:35] multiply if man is alone if the woman is
[59:38] in the
[59:39] man he cannot
[59:42] multiply all that God was he pour into
[59:46] Christ God needed
[59:49] Christ to express who he is and dwell as
[59:53] the fullness of the godhead B
[59:58] that's why God said this is my beloved
[1:00:02] Son in him I can express myself
[1:00:07] completely Hallelujah and I believe
[1:00:09] that's for that's why God needs the
[1:00:11] bride
[1:00:13] today and so it's always the
[1:00:16] father and as we saw that as we said
[1:00:19] there's good there's there was there
[1:00:20] will be good good people in
[1:00:23] hell like the Rich Young Ruler
[1:00:27] there will be bad people in
[1:00:30] heaven they don't stay
[1:00:33] bad amen but God can take bad people God
[1:00:37] can take bad
[1:00:49] people come on
[1:00:52] Church Matthew 22 read it
[1:00:56] not now take it
[1:00:58] home and here the
[1:01:00] father you know it's it's again
[1:01:03] amazing it was the king the father
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:13] inviting this should make us
[1:01:16] Marvel why is the father inviting
[1:01:26] it was not the
[1:01:28] son inviting
[1:01:31] people it was not the son inviting
[1:01:36] guests it was the
[1:01:39] father is that
[1:01:41] right and people refused to come to the
[1:01:47] wedding is it
[1:01:50] right allow me to say that might maybe
[1:01:53] shock
[1:01:54] you people refuse
[1:01:57] people
[1:01:58] refused to be the
[1:02:07] bride Matthew
[1:02:10] 22 there's the king the
[1:02:13] father where's the
[1:02:16] bride where's the
[1:02:22] bridegroom it was the father inviting
[1:02:25] remember it was always the
[1:02:29] father was making Adam a
[1:02:33] wife the
[1:02:35] father was making Christ a
[1:02:40] bride he put Christ into a deep sleep at
[1:02:45] Calvary and then he caused the bride to
[1:02:47] take
[1:02:49] him he ca a deep sleep on
[1:02:53] Adam then the father
[1:02:57] took
[1:02:58] something and made the bride out of
[1:03:02] it he was the father he was the king
[1:03:08] inviting come to the
[1:03:11] wedding come to the wedding of my
[1:03:16] son all of them
[1:03:18] refused and he get so
[1:03:21] upset the father gets so
[1:03:24] upset I mean he should be
[1:03:26] happy less people are
[1:03:29] coming less expenses
[1:03:36] W but the father is
[1:03:40] abset come on Church why is the
[1:03:46] father this is a type
[1:03:49] church this is a
[1:03:51] type that people are invited to come to
[1:03:55] the wedding
[1:03:57] for the marriage supper of the
[1:03:59] land
[1:04:02] finally the father said go
[1:04:06] everywhere take good and
[1:04:12] evil so there will be evil
[1:04:15] people at the
[1:04:18] wedding that's why I said there will be
[1:04:20] evil
[1:04:22] people in heaven
[1:04:27] but what happens at the wedding Watch
[1:04:30] What Happens at the
[1:04:32] wedding if you follow the
[1:04:36] invitation if you are willing to be a
[1:04:38] part of the marriage of the
[1:04:43] L that character God
[1:04:48] needs then when you come to the
[1:04:51] wedding at the
[1:04:54] door because we all have to enter
[1:04:56] through that
[1:04:58] door and that door is
[1:05:01] Christ there you see the husband
[1:05:05] standing the husband standing at the
[1:05:08] door what he has in
[1:05:10] store the wedding garment he has
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:16] inore so good and
[1:05:20] evil as they come to that process
[1:05:22] through the door
[1:05:25] they get a wedding
[1:05:30] garments you
[1:05:33] follow hallelujah oh if he could walk
[1:05:36] that
[1:05:38] principle why is the father so
[1:05:43] anxious why is the king
[1:05:47] upset when people said I'm sorry I have
[1:05:49] no time to come to
[1:05:52] church I have something to do it
[1:05:55] my my cows and my animals and
[1:05:58] my my crop my field I'm
[1:06:02] sorry hey come on how many times we have
[1:06:06] excuses to come to
[1:06:09] church how many times we have excuses to
[1:06:11] come up to
[1:06:14] church this is more important and that
[1:06:16] is more
[1:06:19] important God wants to have you
[1:06:23] here because you are God's
[1:06:29] potential why was the king so
[1:06:33] upset of them refusing to come
[1:06:39] to did you ever thought of
[1:06:46] it like I
[1:06:48] said he should be
[1:06:51] happy because less people less eating
[1:07:04] but you understand the
[1:07:07] principle
[1:07:09] everyone that refused to
[1:07:13] come taken the chance
[1:07:17] away from the
[1:07:19] King to express himself
[1:07:28] Abraham he was very
[1:07:31] careful what kind of bride Isaac would
[1:07:37] have
[1:07:39] Abraham was more
[1:07:42] cared than Isaac
[1:07:48] himself is it not
[1:07:50] amazing it was not Isaac
[1:07:54] saying if you go you find me a bride
[1:07:58] don't go to wrong places just go to my
[1:08:01] family no it was
[1:08:07] Abraham
[1:08:09] Abraham Abraham listen very carefully
[1:08:15] Abraham but
[1:08:17] Rebecca should not be Abraham's
[1:08:20] bride Rebecca should be Isaac's bride
[1:08:27] but you know what Abraham
[1:08:29] knew Isaac is me in another
[1:08:38] form and when Isaac has a
[1:08:41] bride the right kind of
[1:08:44] bright the next one will be in further
[1:08:49] expression
[1:08:51] am this is what Abraham
[1:08:54] knew this is what God
[1:08:56] knows that's why God is
[1:08:59] careful God is looking for a bride for
[1:09:03] Christ it is always the father it is
[1:09:07] always the
[1:09:08] father because this is the unveiling of
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:15] God I trust you can take that sorry I
[1:09:18] trust you can take
[1:09:20] that not the unveiling of Jesus Christ
[1:09:27] Jesus Christ is the head of the
[1:09:31] body but this is the unveiling of
[1:09:38] God hallelujah can you say praise the
[1:09:42] Lord oh I trust you
[1:09:46] understand amen as we go
[1:09:49] slowly so the the Rapture is only for
[1:09:52] the bride
[1:09:55] she it's only for the
[1:09:57] bride so you cannot work yourself into
[1:10:02] it canot pray prayers to be a part of
[1:10:07] it you you cannot pay money to be a part
[1:10:11] of
[1:10:12] it whatever you can do the Rapture is
[1:10:16] only for the
[1:10:21] bride are you not
[1:10:23] glad that by grace
[1:10:26] he chose
[1:10:30] you that's why the scripture
[1:10:33] said you have not chosen
[1:10:35] me but I have chosen
[1:10:39] you he understands
[1:10:43] election it's God's love to
[1:10:46] you that he
[1:10:48] chose that he chose you not not to be a
[1:10:51] man or a woman in Uganda
[1:10:56] to be a part of the
[1:10:58] Bride if you are a part of the
[1:11:02] Bride cannot miss the
[1:11:10] Rapture the Rapture the Rapture will
[1:11:12] come to
[1:11:14] you the dead in Christ will come to
[1:11:17] you they will only come to Bright
[1:11:22] material
[1:11:23] Hallelujah can be say thank you
[1:11:27] Lord yes can we say thank you
[1:11:32] Lord
[1:11:34] hallelujah so regardless how clever you
[1:11:36] are in
[1:11:39] school how good you are with your
[1:11:43] hands that doesn't qualify you to be
[1:11:49] the hallelujah
[1:11:52] hallelujah amen am you you are you are
[1:11:56] you you are God chose you to be a part
[1:11:58] of the
[1:12:00] Bride so as brother R would
[1:12:03] say brother Ram said um remember
[1:12:08] also the prophet would speak about
[1:12:10] little
[1:12:13] children you know when little children
[1:12:15] when they
[1:12:18] die people ask brother Rand the
[1:12:21] question when little babies little
[1:12:23] children die
[1:12:26] they had no chance to
[1:12:28] decide they had no chance they never
[1:12:31] came to the age of
[1:12:33] decision so when they die they're born
[1:12:36] in sin is that
[1:12:39] right but the blood of Jesus
[1:12:43] Christ come on
[1:12:46] Church they said brother R where does
[1:12:48] little babies and children
[1:12:52] go he said babies when they die
[1:12:57] he say they go to
[1:13:00] heaven amen
[1:13:04] amen and then they asked him another
[1:13:07] question what about the
[1:13:10] Rapture brother Adam said if they are
[1:13:13] predestinated for that again
[1:13:32] hallelujah amen you understand it's not
[1:13:35] your
[1:13:36] choice it's not what you can
[1:13:39] do or what you have not
[1:13:41] done it's only by
[1:13:47] Grace just God's Grace Church never
[1:13:52] forget
[1:13:53] that the Rapture
[1:13:56] it's God's grace to
[1:14:03] you if we if we receive it like
[1:14:07] that God can show us very very
[1:14:12] far Hallelujah never get puffed
[1:14:16] up never think you have earned you the
[1:14:21] Rapture I have preached all of my life
[1:14:25] there's
[1:14:26] people that preach much more than
[1:14:30] myself there's people in the world they
[1:14:33] pray much more than you
[1:14:38] pray brother bam said the church with
[1:14:43] the Zeal they
[1:14:46] have will push the bride
[1:14:50] aside that's why they come to him and
[1:14:53] say have not we done it in your
[1:14:55] name we were hard workers in your name
[1:14:59] we have cast out Devils we have laid
[1:15:02] hands on the SI in your
[1:15:06] name and Jesus just looked at
[1:15:09] them he said I don't know
[1:15:17] you Hallelujah come on
[1:15:20] church it's God's grace
[1:15:26] because it's God's
[1:15:27] grace you should love
[1:15:34] him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:38] amen amen
[1:15:42] amen my have we started yes okay we have
[1:15:51] started because we understand when we
[1:15:53] speak of bright
[1:15:58] listen brother Bram never
[1:16:00] said all that are
[1:16:04] saved go in the
[1:16:07] Rapture he said only the
[1:16:12] bride will go in
[1:16:16] the amen amen hallelujah amen there's
[1:16:21] many people saved
[1:16:25] they know Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ as their
[1:16:33] savior do you know Jesus Christ as your
[1:16:37] savior can I see your
[1:16:41] hands
[1:16:43] okay hallelujah what a wonderful
[1:16:46] relationship that
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:51] is but when he saved you
[1:16:55] for what he saved
[1:16:59] you
[1:17:02] uhuh when I save some
[1:17:06] money it is for a
[1:17:10] purpose when I have
[1:17:13] 100o when I have
[1:17:15] 100o and I know a bill is
[1:17:21] coming from 50
[1:17:25] then I will
[1:17:27] save from the
[1:17:29] hundred
[1:17:31] 50 and don't give it
[1:17:34] way because I save it because I have a
[1:17:42] purpose Hallelujah am hallelujah amen am
[1:17:47] amen am so that's why when you are
[1:17:52] saved you should not stop
[1:17:59] walking you said walking walking
[1:18:04] walking when you are
[1:18:06] saved you should ask the
[1:18:10] Lord what is the reason you saved
[1:18:17] me
[1:18:18] hallelujah
[1:18:20] hallelujah but only the bride will go in
[1:18:23] the rapture
[1:18:26] hallelujah amen and as we speak of the
[1:18:30] Bride it speaks of a certain
[1:18:38] relationship it is the bride of
[1:18:41] Christ it was the Bride of
[1:18:44] Isaac but Abraham choose
[1:18:50] her Hallelujah it is the bride of Christ
[1:18:55] but God chose
[1:19:01] you yeah you follow the
[1:19:04] principle because Abraham
[1:19:07] knew Isaac is me in another
[1:19:13] form and when he has a good
[1:19:16] bride the potential is
[1:19:19] there that another expression of myself
[1:19:26] comes through
[1:19:28] Isaac God knows if the Bride is a good
[1:19:32] bride he can express himself through
[1:19:36] Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ Hallelujah am Hallelujah yes what
[1:19:46] a story that
[1:19:48] is can we see that in
[1:19:51] the amen It's a Wonderful we show it
[1:19:54] from genes
[1:19:56] from Genesis you can see from the Garden
[1:19:59] of
[1:20:00] Eden that's why brother Ram said the
[1:20:03] oldest
[1:20:05] institution the oldest
[1:20:10] institution gave to his
[1:20:14] children is
[1:20:18] what
[1:20:20] marriage before there any church
[1:20:23] was even before the
[1:20:26] fall and I want to say marriage was not
[1:20:31] introduced because of the
[1:20:34] Fall marriage was
[1:20:38] introduced before the
[1:20:42] fall
[1:20:44] hallelujah amen
[1:20:48] hallelujah who was the
[1:20:51] performer oh my if we understand
[1:20:55] what God is
[1:20:56] doing we understand that God has to
[1:20:59] inherit
[1:21:02] something and and for inheriting
[1:21:07] something he needs
[1:21:10] somebody that takes that
[1:21:13] inheritance you understand that there's
[1:21:16] things that God cannot
[1:21:22] do Hallelujah
[1:21:25] amen
[1:21:28] amen the level the level the
[1:21:32] level and kind of
[1:21:36] relationship you have to the one who
[1:21:42] inherits
[1:21:44] defines what your inheritance will
[1:21:50] be amen I want to give you a very simple
[1:21:53] example
[1:21:55] so
[1:21:57] powerful I'm married I have a
[1:22:01] wife I have one
[1:22:04] wife I have 10
[1:22:10] children if my time has
[1:22:13] come if my time has
[1:22:16] come and the Lord calls me
[1:22:20] home then I have certain things to
[1:22:22] inherit
[1:22:27] maybe I have a house or
[1:22:38] whatever who herit who inherits
[1:22:48] the who inherits the most
[1:22:55] they are say the
[1:23:01] wife yes my
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] wife my children
[1:23:14] also but first is my wife
[1:23:19] [Applause]
[1:23:28] amen you find that principle in the
[1:23:31] Bible
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:36] oh
[1:23:39] hallelujah oh my oh my oh you are saying
[1:23:43] something
[1:23:45] different yes cannot
[1:23:48] inherit we find that in the Bible
[1:23:56] we find that in the
[1:23:59] Bible go back to the Book of
[1:24:06] Esther go back to the book of
[1:24:11] es now we don't
[1:24:13] go take the ex if you take the example
[1:24:17] of
[1:24:22] Esther when she came to the king
[1:24:25] because of her
[1:24:29] position I don't know if children were
[1:24:31] there
[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:35] already maybe maybe she had
[1:24:38] children the king had many
[1:24:41] wives there was a lot of children lot of
[1:24:44] children maybe Esther and the King they
[1:24:46] had
[1:24:48] children but the King was not so much
[1:24:51] interested in the children
[1:24:55] the King was interested in his
[1:24:59] wife that's why when Esther
[1:25:03] came what what the king
[1:25:05] said half of my
[1:25:08] kingdom I give
[1:25:12] you
[1:25:14] hallelujah amen amen
[1:25:17] amen so it is very
[1:25:21] interesting because if we come to
[1:25:23] relationship
[1:25:26] and I want you to be very
[1:25:29] careful Adam and his
[1:25:31] wife was not created as little
[1:25:34] [Music]

[1:25:42] right they were grown
[1:25:47] up

[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:26:00] Bride when God Saves
[1:26:03] you you become and you are his
[1:26:07] son and his
[1:26:10] daughter but when he places
[1:26:14] you then you become the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:21] Christ Hallelujah am amen amen so as you
[1:26:26] allow me to say
[1:26:30] that you can see that even with the with
[1:26:33] the
[1:26:35] Patriarchs you can see that in many
[1:26:37] types in the
[1:26:40] Bible that the
[1:26:42] woman even when it came to Adam and his
[1:26:46] wife Adam had a strong
[1:26:51] bound to the woman
[1:26:57] then he had to his own
[1:27:07] son because the
[1:27:10] wife came out of
[1:27:15] him do you know what brother Bram said

[1:27:49] position that the bride has
[1:27:54] when it comes to

[1:33:35] Lamb brings us
[1:33:39] back the first marriage happened in
[1:33:44] Eden the fall came by
[1:33:49] eating now in Satan's
[1:33:52] Eden restoration
[1:33:55] comes back to you while you
[1:33:59] eat and the marriage of the Lamb takes

[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:33] Hallelujah
[1:34:35] my don't
[1:34:37] forget Adam and Eve Adam and the
[1:34:41] woman was made in the image of
[1:34:47] God amen amen they were
[1:34:51] made and help help me
[1:34:55] they were
[1:34:57] created but also
[1:35:05] made as we can
[1:35:08] say it's it's it's
[1:35:11] beautiful because also Satan is
[1:35:15] created Satan is
[1:35:20] created but like we said this morning
[1:35:24] he is
[1:35:25] Created from
[1:35:33] nothing but when God made Adam and his
[1:35:38] wife he made them from
[1:35:45] something that's
[1:35:47] why the true
[1:35:50] bride goes not back to nothing
[1:35:55] the bright the true
[1:36:02] bright let's go quickly first John let's
[1:36:05] go together first John
[1:36:08] 3:9 it makes it it makes it very
[1:36:19] plain chose it very
[1:36:22] beautiful uh
[1:36:28] as we can
[1:36:32] say
[1:36:34] Satan was
[1:36:37] created is that
[1:36:39] right who created
[1:36:42] him
[1:36:44] God Adam and
[1:36:47] Eve was made
[1:36:56] they were also
[1:36:58] created in the image of God
[1:37:04] created but watch the
[1:37:10] difference 1 John
[1:37:14] 3:9
[1:37:16] whosoever is born of
[1:37:19] God does not commit sin
[1:37:24] for the seed remains in then he cannot
[1:37:27] sin because he is born of
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:47] God allow me to make that
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:52] simple you are born of
[1:37:56] God Satan is born from
[1:38:00] God because God has created
[1:38:06] him but he that is born of
[1:38:11] God he cannot commit
[1:38:19] sin we see the difference
[1:38:25] every
[1:38:26] remember
[1:38:28] as the woman would
[1:38:30] say I have received a
[1:38:34] man from the
[1:38:38] Lord speaking of
[1:38:44] Cain oh yeah yeah yeah
[1:38:46] yeah how many people got
[1:38:50] confused because they say why should
[1:38:53] became
[1:38:56] serpent but watch what she
[1:38:58] said I have
[1:39:01] received from the
[1:39:08] Lord and it was
[1:39:11] Cain brother Ram said every life comes
[1:39:14] from
[1:39:21] God but not every life is of
[1:39:27] god you get
[1:39:30] that he never said I got the man of the
[1:39:37] Lord he said I got the man from the
[1:39:41] Lord and that was
[1:39:46] Kain you are
[1:39:48] there and he that is born of God
[1:39:54] cannot
[1:39:55] sin because the seed remains in
[1:40:01] it are you not
[1:40:04] glad that you are born of
[1:40:14] God let me let me expound a little on
[1:40:20] that because I we want to really make
[1:40:23] that
[1:40:24] relationship
[1:40:31] so hallelujah hallelujah oh my if I had
[1:40:41] time what kind of relationship it
[1:40:46] was between

[1:40:57] what relationship they
[1:41:02] had he was made in the image of
[1:41:06] God is that
[1:41:08] right so as you would see them walking
[1:41:11] in
[1:41:13] Eden you wouldn't see a great Pillar of
[1:41:16] Fire you wouldn't see a great Pillar of
[1:41:21] Fire and a small pillar of
[1:41:27] as father
[1:41:31] on what would you
[1:41:34] see he was in the image of
[1:41:40] God if you see an image of
[1:41:44] me you don't see a little

[1:41:50] me you see me
[1:41:53] in another
[1:41:58] form hallelujah amen that
[1:42:03] relationship
[1:42:06] existed and because of that
[1:42:10] relationship there was an
[1:42:12] inheritance it was there was an
[1:42:16] inheritance and God said multiplied
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:25] God never said I will multiply he said
[1:42:28] to Adam and his wife
[1:42:31] multiply replenish the
[1:42:37] Earth Hallelujah one an

[1:43:41] question is said all in the
[1:43:44] atonement he said
[1:43:51] sure hey sure
[1:43:56] God would tell him that's why Jesus
[1:44:00] died when God said Jesus said it's
[1:44:03] finished salvation was
[1:44:07] complete the same
[1:44:09] carabines the same car the same

[2:00:14] book things come out of your Bible that
[2:00:18] you have never seen before
[2:00:25] and as they were in the wedding
[2:00:27] ceremony maybe Joshua performed
[2:00:30] it he said and he's asking the
[2:00:32] public here we have we have we have we
[2:00:35] have ought RAB the
[2:00:38] har and here we have

[2:01:02] audience that has legal rights on that
[2:01:06] woman remember she was a
[2:01:11] harlot there was many men in Jer
[2:01:24] Hallelujah but when when Joshua asked
[2:01:27] the
[2:01:29] question he stood
[2:01:32] bold because all of them had
[2:01:41] died come on
[2:01:45] church God told
[2:01:49] Israel what did God told Israel
[2:01:54] clean the
[2:01:57] place come on
[2:01:59] Church hello
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:02] hello so as they were standing there and
[2:02:06] maybe Rahab was a little
[2:02:10] nervous Hallelujah because she knew her
[2:02:19] past Solomon said to her
[2:02:22] don't
[2:02:25] worry Salon said we killed them
[2:02:31] all your
[2:02:33] bridegroom Jesus
[2:02:35] Christ
[2:02:37] today tell you don't worry about your
[2:02:41] old
[2:02:42] husband they are all
[2:02:47] dead hey
[2:02:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:02:56] listen is that okay when I say
[2:02:59] that what lifted her
[2:03:02] up from a
[2:03:05] har to a
[2:03:07] mother in the lineage of Jesus
[2:03:18] Christ hallelujah what lifted her up
[2:03:21] is it okay when I say
[2:03:25] that it was not the obedience to the tap
[2:03:37] boys many people
[2:03:40] trust oh we are good to the Bram
[2:03:45] family we should be good to the
[2:03:48] BR we should pray for the BR
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:55] but that didn't lifted her
[2:03:58] up she stayed right the
[2:04:01] Harlot is that okay when I say
[2:04:05] that even with the Scarlet Strat outside
[2:04:08] hanging even with a Scarlet
[2:04:18] threat that was just the down payment
[2:04:26] that's why the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:29] Ghost Paul said is a down
[2:04:39] payment can we say praise the
[2:04:42] Lord what did Paul say to the
[2:04:45] Ephesians Paul Paul what he tells you
[2:04:49] the
[2:04:50] Ephesians I have heard of your faith I
[2:04:53] have heard of your
[2:04:54] faith I have heard of your
[2:04:57] love I have heard that you have all
[2:04:59] reive the Holy
[2:05:01] Spirit and Paul said now I
[2:05:06] pray come on church that God gives you
[2:05:11] the spirit of wisdom and
[2:05:16] Revelation that's why Paul could say the
[2:05:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a down
[2:05:23] payment but the full
[2:05:25] price is when he comes
[2:05:32] [Applause]
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:40] down how powerful that isina
[2:05:52] I asked you a
[2:05:55] question was Martin Luther Martin Lu was
[2:05:58] he born
[2:06:05] again come
[2:06:07] on was he born
[2:06:09] again has had Martin Luther the Holy
[2:06:17] Ghost yes
[2:06:20] yes amen
[2:06:24] am he was born again he had the Holy
[2:06:28] Ghost and the people around him the
[2:06:32] same and yet there was no
[2:06:39] Rapture
[2:06:41] Pentecost was the restoration of the
[2:06:44] gifts the sign of the baptism of the
[2:06:46] Holy
[2:06:47] Ghost justification under Luther
[2:06:50] sanctification
[2:06:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost under the
[2:06:55] Pentecost but it never produced a
[2:07:04] Rapture because the
[2:07:06] Rapture is only for the
[2:07:10] [Applause]

[2:30:39] yes many have made
[2:30:43] calculations based on the word of the
[2:30:46] Bible remember brother brandham
[2:30:50] he took things of the
[2:30:52] Bible and he said according to my
[2:30:56] looking at
[2:30:58] things about
[2:31:03] 1977 is that
[2:31:06] right somebody can say Amen you all know
[2:31:10] that not only once brother said that he
[2:31:14] said I can miss
[2:31:15] that that's why he said I do not
[2:31:18] prophesy or predict or
[2:31:24] prophesy but as a student of the
[2:31:34] Bible do you
[2:31:36] know
[2:31:38] said there's a great difference between
[2:31:40] the appearing of Christ and the coming
[2:31:43] of Christ
[2:31:44] [Music]
[2:31:53] but we are
[2:31:54] living not in the second
[2:31:58] appearing in the second
[2:32:00] [Music]
[2:32:04] coming what is the
[2:32:06] difference between the appearing and the
[2:32:10] coming the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:32:19] hallelujah amen hallelujah aen the Bride
[2:32:23] of Jesus
[2:32:24] Christ brother Ram said he first takes
[2:32:28] first
[2:32:30] Thessalonians he said when he is taken
[2:32:33] out of the
[2:32:35] way then the Antichrist will be manifest
[2:32:41] fully that mean he is holding it
[2:32:46] back brother said that he
[2:32:50] is the
[2:32:55] church that he is the
[2:32:59] bride that is her
[2:33:06] inheritance Hallelujah am remember
[2:33:09] brother Bram 60 years ago he would tell
[2:33:13] his people God allow me to tell you you
[2:33:18] are forgiven
[2:33:21] and only God can
[2:33:25] forgive I want to say again brother told
[2:33:29] his people God allowed me to tell you
[2:33:34] you are
[2:33:35] forgiven and only God can
[2:33:39] forgive it was not brilliant Brandon
[2:33:42] forgiving it was God through William br
[2:33:52] Hallelujah
[2:33:59] am my special person that
[2:34:10] Enoch special person
[2:34:15] that that's the scripture please
[2:34:22] yes Genesis 5:24 you can bring
[2:34:26] it and with that I'm closing I'm just
[2:34:30] closing my
[2:34:34] Bible watch
[2:34:39] beautiful and
[2:34:41] Enoch walked with
[2:34:43] God are you walking with
[2:34:47] God who is Walking with God
[2:34:51] that means you're not
[2:34:55] stagnating you're walking with
[2:34:57] him move with the spirit this is what
[2:35:01] God wants his people to
[2:35:02] do move with the spirit move with the
[2:35:09] time
[2:35:11] listen the Bible said and he was
[2:35:17] not he was translated
[2:35:20] he was
[2:35:22] changed you know what he was
[2:35:26] changed the reason why he was changed
[2:35:29] the reason why he was translated the
[2:35:31] reason why he was
[2:35:33] raptured is for
[2:35:38] God took
[2:35:43] him that
[2:35:45] word
[2:35:47] took means in the
[2:35:51] Greek no in the
[2:35:55] Hebrew it means to take
[2:36:00] possession to
[2:36:02] select to
[2:36:04] choose to
[2:36:12] marry to Mary that
[2:36:16] means for because God married
[2:36:23] [Music]
[2:36:27] Enoch that's why he was
[2:36:41] not Hallelujah there you see what
[2:36:44] happened there a secret to
[2:36:47] Enoch he went to the
[2:36:50] process can we say that you see the

[2:36:58] understand knew the
[2:37:00] mystery of
[2:37:03] salvation but then came a time when he
[2:37:06] walked with God God was so
[2:37:09] pleased Hallelujah and God is so was so
[2:37:13] so pleased with his
[2:37:16] bride he comes back to church
