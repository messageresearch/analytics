hallelujah oh sing goana sing goana sing goana to the king oh Hallelujah Sing goana Sing goana Sing goana To the King of Kings amen praise the name of our Lord let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you Lord for this evening the privilege that you've given un us father that Lord we can come in your presence Lord you said in your word that where two or three are gaed in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord we believe you here in our midst therefore we commit ourselves unto your hands and father you said also in your word they shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be their peace we pray Lord you may teach us through your word and grant us that peace that surpasses all understanding and bless us all together tonight may you meet all the needs of your children Lord touch our bodies Lord and touch also our souls and make us whole in the name of Jesus Christ us amen we go to John chapter 14 I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we go to John Chapter 14 verse 16 to verse 18 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I'll come to you of his word may be seated so this evening I want talk on the subject the comforter has come praise the name of the Lord the comforter has come and so here we see the scripture telling us that the comforter is the spirit of Truth praise the name of the Lord and we can also say because when you read in John chapter 17 and then verse 17 he says sanctify them through Thy word thy truth rather Thy word is truth so we can also that the spirit of Truth is the spirit of the word praise the name of the Lord so he says even the spirit of the world even the spirit of the the world which the world cannot receive why couldn't the world receive the spirit because they have rejected the word and where the word of God is rejected the spirit of God cannot have a free cause in that praise the name of our Lord so in the when you look at that word comforter comforter means Advocate comforter means Advocate you know the one who is called to your side like when you go to the courts of law when you have maybe a case there to answer so The Advocate is the one who stands for you is the one who talks to the judge on your behalf so even the holy spirit is our Advocate it talks on our he stands on our side he comes to our Aid you know so he pleads our case before the judge he intercedes for us praise the name of our Lord he helps us you know he enables us he assists us a Christian Life is full of challenges is full of you know kind of like TR of the devil there's a lot of opposition from Satan need the holy spirit that the Holy Ghost can always help you in all those challenges to warn you what is going to happen the way the scripture tells us in John 14 and verse 26 the Bible says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things he shall bring all things to your remembrance and whatsoever I have said unto you so now you see that when we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit we receive a teacher an inside teacher in other words he gives us guidance he tells us what to do he directs us when the scripture says as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the children of God so now when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior allow him to fill you with the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord and it's not difficult to be filled with the Holy Spirit just as we've been going through this Wednesday services of the Holy Spirit the way Jesus says in John 3 and verse that unless a man is born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God and then brother Bram says to understand to see and now if you are blind to the things of God how will you appreciate the things of God just the way the scripture says in First Corinthians from verse 9 to verse 13 it says no man knows the things of God except the spirit of God so even us to not things of God we must receive the spirit of God and this is what he's saying that the Holy Spirit when he comes he will teach us all things not some things and see brother was challenging the p in his day he says you say I've spoken in Tong you know I've done this I've prophesied then he says but then how can you say that you have the spirit of God and then you follow the Trinity baptism when it is revealed that the name of Jesus Christ because the holy spirit will always guide us to the word of God praise the name of our Lord will always direct us there now in the message the Ephesian Church age he says the way of God is Holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of Christ until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice and you see if we can take some bit of time on this area people want to sacrifice but they don't want to obey they think that they can do all the sacrifices they can do I can pray I can fast I can do great things which is all good but the first thing to do is be obedient to the word of God that's when the Lord will accept your sacrifices praise the name of our Lord you know they they don't want to obey the word of God but then they want to do the sacrifices and then they think that God will accept them because they are giving a sacrifice but at the same time despising the word of God the same thing like Saul Saul was told you go and kill all the people and so when he reached in that place he reserved the best sheep and the best things and then he said we've brought them to sacrifice to God and then the prophet was asking Saul does God appreciate your sacrifices more than obedience to his word you can pick that from first Samuel first Samuel and then we go to verse chapter 16 chapter 15 rather and then verse verse 21 okay let us start from verse verse 20 and Saul said unto Samuel yes I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought aak the king of AMC and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoil the sheep and The Oxen the chip of the things which should have been D utter destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in G [Music] and Samuel said has the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the f praise the name of the Lord obedience to the word of God and that's what always brings the comforter because the comforter is the teacher of the word the comforter is the instructor praise the name of our Lord the comforter is the preacher now if you are rejecting to hear the preacher then how can he come inside of you how can he come and make his AB in you when you have rejected his voice praise the name of our Lord it can't work out so the way the Holy Ghost can come in our lives is if we can hear the word of God and then be obedient to that word of God and that's how the Holy Ghost comes and let me say this also by the time you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior that means you have surrendered to be obedient to what the Lord will tell you to do praise the name of Lord the says believeth with the heart and then confession is made with the mouth so you confess what you have believed and what you believe you confess it and then you do it and then you obey it that's how the Holy Ghost comes down in our hearts so the brother Bram is saying that if you don't live a holy life then God refuses your sacrifice all our sacrifices are in vain we not obedient to the word of God praise the name of our Lord and you know there are many aspects you can talk about obedience praise the name of our Lord you know like God has given you a certain responsibility like sa was given a responsibility Go and Kill everything he went and did it halfway and then the good things reserved for himself then God said you have rejected my voice so then when we hear the word of God you need to be obedient to the word of God let me just talk about the common things that we do like the word of God tells us love your enemy very it's so it's EAS to find out who your enemy is and it is EAS to hate them but then for you when you find your enemy do you justify hating them you know like Naturally Speaking you dislike those who dislike you and you like those who like you that's but then we are talking about AAL life of Jesus Christ not the natural the natural you give the one who gives you but then the you give the one who can't even give you you go beyond what the natural is so then we can check our Liv and then find out are we obedient to the word of God somebody cheats you do you pray for them or do you forgive them because these are the basics every day we go through these kind of things your neighbors maybe your family maybe at home you have a misunderstanding at home maybe among the children or among the husband and the wife among children and the parents what do you think about your parents what do you think about your children you start curing them because they have done something wrong to you but yet the word of God says praise the name of our Lord pray for those that despitefully use you let us go to MTH 5 praise the name of our Lord Matthew 5 and then we go to verse 40 verse 44 okay let us start from verse 43 you've heard that it has been said thou sht love thy neighbor and Hate th [Music] enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you praise the name of Lord love your enemies bless them that Cur you do good to them that hate you pray for those that despitefully use you and persecute you praise the name of our Lord you see God requires obedience to these things you've heard don't hate your enemy so you love them now you say Lord help me to Love My Enemy maybe your boss at place of work he doesn't want to pay your salary now you don't wish to hear bad things about him I wish his family would get into the same situation I get into the same kind of thing so then you pray Lord give me the Grace To Love My Enemy Lord give me the grace to pray for these people you know there are people in your life even don't want to hear about you don't want to hear that name or if you hear that they coming you make excuse of not going where they going to be keep them in prayers brother says that sweeten your temple bitterness with prayer and then you pray Lord deliver me from that condition Lord deliver me from that evil heart against deliver me from these evil thoughts about this person that and then verse5 he says that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven praise the name of the Lord so the children of God they love their enemies praise the name of our Lord the children of God don't wish evil for anybody you know so you have that kind of love and you know that kind of sweetness you know even for your enemies like brother Billy Paul was talking about brother Bram he said you can't tell who who his enemy is or who his friend is then brother Bram says you disagree with anybody now so where is the comforter because when the comforter is inside of you he will convict you that what you have done is wrong praise the name of the Lord and then you say Lord have mercy upon me deliver me from this kind of situation praise the name of the Lord so then brother Bram says before we can go further to that let us go to John chapter 16 and then we can read verse 7 it says nevertheless I tell you that I tell you the truth it's expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no of judgment because the prince of this world is judged now he says when the comforter is come he will prove the world of sin so now when you have the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will always guide you because the Bible says in verse 13 how but when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth and truth is the word of God so now if the truth which is the word of God is telling us to love our enemies and you have the Holy Spirit and you can afford to hit your enemy if the spirit of God is in you and for you you can easily hate your enemy and you have no conviction there's no Holy Spirit there praise the name of the Lord that's what it implies but if the holy spirit is there he will reprove thatting he will proove it in your life he will proove that things in your life and then you can say Lord have mercy upon me in this kind of area praise the name of the Lord and then you call on the name of the Lord then he comes and helps you praise the name of Lord that's how the Holy Spirit works the Holy Ghost is not not an imagination oh just a thought I think I have the Holy Spirit but the holy spirit is a reality praise the name of the Lord and you know we are living in a time where people want to get the comfort of emotions and Sensations people want the satisfaction of the holy spirit with emotions and Sensations say you see I have the Holy Ghost here but that's not what it is it is the Life of Christ himself praise the name of the Lord but you know people want to show that I have the Holy Ghost because I shouted surely you can Shout with the Holy Ghost I can speak with thanks with the Holy Ghost I can feel emotion with the Holy Ghost but yet at the same time I may not do what you know one may think I have to do this because the Holy Ghost is Sovereign praise the name of the Lord but the people seek the Holy Spirit following emotions how did you [Music] feel maybe but when you test their love hatred why is that Holy Spirit now you know you find that is something which is not true you know brother Bram said that one of the SS sure that somebody is Born Again is humility humility and the humility of God will always bring the love of God will bring the you know the sweetness of God but if I'm the person all the time criticizing the other oneing the other one that one doesn't have the Holy Ghost that one doesn't have the Holy Ghost I need to check myself first where is the sweetness of God praise the name of our Lord so he says the spirit of truth will guide us into all truth that's what Obedience of all the word and then the Lord Jesus Christ says praise the name of our Lord in John chapter 15 and then verse 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved praise the name this is my commandment that you love another John 13 and verse 35 okay let us start from verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you love one another and you know when you read these scriptures are very interesting in John Chapter 13 he puts an emphas on love in John chter 14 puts an emphasis on love in John chapter 15 he puts an emphas on love in John chapter 16 puts an emphas on love in John chapter 17 he puts an emphas on love and all this these scriptures here from John Chapter 13 up to John chapter 17 they all happened in a short time after Lord before Christ would go into prayer in GTH he spoke a lot all those chapters chapter 13 chapter 14 chapter 15 chapter 16 chapter 17 before he was was arrested and there are scriptures they are the scriptures that teach more about the holy spirit that speak more about the comforter than you can go in other parts of the Bible and then you cannot say I have the comforter I can say I have the Holy Spirit and I can afford to hate another person there's no Holy Spirit there now praise the name of Lord because you can't separate them praise the name of our Lord you cannot so he says when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth how can you have all truth which is the word and you can afford to hurt to you are fortable hating you know you are contented to hate you are contented to talk you are you are you are contented to despise others you can't you can't say that the Holy Spirit now because he will guide you into all Truth for you will not of the body of Christ until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice God demands our obedience you know much more than the sacrifices we can make because if if you're not obedient to God how will he hear your prayer but then the Bible says ears of God praise the name of Lord they they want to hear the prayers of the righteous believe that is in the book of Peter praise the name of the Lord wish I can get it first it's in the book of First Peter first pter 5 okay we can start reading from verse verse 6 he says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care unto him for he cares be sober be be vigilant because your adversary devil as a ring lion walth about seeking whom he might praise the name of the Lord I'm failing to get let us go to Proverbs [Music] 15:8 prover 158 the Bible says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth him that follow follows after righteous praise the name of the Lord so then how will you offer your sacrifices and then God reject them because you are not obedient to the word so then we need to start with obedience and then we bring our sacrifices like like Cain and Abel the Bible says God did not have respect did not have respectto and his sacrifice so it first starts with you and then what you do it says but God had respect unto Abel let us go to Genesis chapter 4 praise the name of the Lord and then verse three and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the fings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto abto his offering and his offering he had no respect and Cain was very Ro and his praise the name of our Lord so he says he had respect unto Abel and then his offering he had respect unto Abel why his life was acceptable to God so even his sacrifices were accepted to God but now Cain his life was not accepted so even what he did the sacrifices he made he rejected them and then now you see here how the comforter comes in now now the comforter because here the Bible says in verse and the Lord said unto Cain why are you R praise the name of the Lord he's coming into guide you that what you have done is wrong but there is a way you can make amendments praise the name of the Lord and why is th Contin Fallen if you do well shall th not be accepted you know so the Holy Spirit comes and guides you comes and corrects you and say this thing you have done is not right look what Moses when God told Moses speak to the Rock Andes the another time corrected him you have done is not right and then God is telling why is your Contin fall why are you w praise the name of the Lord say you do well and you will be accepted but came didn't hear the Holy Spirit he rejected the instruction and so he ended up in Father praise the name of the Lord just like the men in John chapter 8 they got the woman who had committed adultery and then they brought her to the Lord Jesus Christ in the temple and then they said this woman and the Bible says one by one when they heard that word they were convicted and when they were convicted did they repent they just went away so now when the Holy Spirit convicts us say Lord have mercy upon me praise the name of our Lord ask go to reconcile you Lord deliver me in this weakness deliver me from this kind of failure that's how you can have continuous communion with the Holy Spirit we can bring it to ourselves now you have somebody you're talking with he's telling you this you are disagreeing with him can you continue conversing he says this says no that's not right no I can't accept that you are shutting them you you you know but now the Holy Ghost is teaching us the word we said me I don't care what you telling me he keeps quiet and that's what the scripture says grieve not the Holy Spirit know don't because you are [Music] rebelling so you are cutting off your fellowship with the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord now in that message let us go back to the Ephesian Church age I'm finding it her to finish praise the name of our Lord see my time is up he says the high priest before he could even come in to offer the sacrifice he had to be holy and dedicated and anointed and perfumed and everything before he could even walk in the presence of God to offer sacrifice is that right then how can you go out here and cheat and steal and F and fight with your neighbors and everything else and carrying on the way you do and then come in and say oh Lord God Praise Jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and sometimes when you go to some of these churches you see some of those who want to be so spiritual when you can continue further into their life you said this is contrary to what they they reflect in church they want the sacrifice but the life is contrary to what they doing people say I I people say I I see them speaking tongues that that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost I hear them shout still that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the life praise the name of our Lord the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord and so that we should always desire more of God in our lives and you know the more of God you have is the more of God gives you more grace in the different challenges because he gives you the strength to do his word praise the name of our Lord he helps you praise the name of our Lord now let me try I conclude I think we shall continue on this next week on Wednesday praise the name of our Lord now let us go to John 15 and then verse 26 he says but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeds from the father he will testify of me and you shall also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning praise the name of the Lord so he says when the Holy Spirit comes you know he will testify of what the Lord is that's what the Holy Ghost will do he will testify that which is of god so he will not come and speak his own things praise the name of our Lord but to just give us that which is the Lord is praise the name of the Lord so the Holy Spirit when he is come and he says it's the spirit of Truth which comes from the father who testify about the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord he testifies about the Lord Jesus Christ and what is that testimony like the word of God the Holy Ghost will endeavor to keep you in the word because the word comes from the spirit it's the spirit of God that speaks to us and you know when we are obedient to the word praise the name of our then then that's when the spirit of God can Quicken that word can make that word alive and then you are able to manifest the word which has been spoken to [Music] you so you hear the spirit speaking you obey what the spirit has told you and then the spirit is the rain praise the name of the Lord and then he comes and makes That Word Alive he quickens that word and that word becomes alive in our lives praise the name of the Lord let me just give maybe some kind of scenario here let us go back to the issue of hatred you know you hear the word of God don't hate your enemy and then you hate your enemy the Holy Ghost convicts you what you're doing is not right then you go cry to the Lord Lord deliver me from this Spirit of hatred Lord deliver me from this Spirit of hatred and you know the Holy Ghost is a teacher and the Holy Ghost teaches by practical God does not assume he'll bring your around and find out have you learned or you have not learned then you see that is done who has come where you are I don't know why that what's wrong with that person and the Holy Ghost is watching then you remember I'm not meant to H him okay let me bear with him being around and then you say Let Me Wait if you will greet me he doesn't greet you pretend as if he's not there and then later you feel I did wrong again another time okay how are you sir you becoming better the first time you were running away the second time you bear to be around the third time you're saying how are you sir the next time you say how is home how is what the things he has done to you have completely gone away your heart is free from what he did Evil to you you're not afraid of him and then he will start wondering who is this kind of person I did for them this bad thing but they now they they have nothing against me the Holy Ghost is a teacher takes us through practical science you don't just calculate but you measure like when they in chemistry lab they say measure two me of this or five Mills of this you are passing through them and observing what happens not like you did electrical you don't say you know electric if you cannot join wires you just only theoretical but then when they give you wires you don't know black goes where red goes where you must know those are the practical the Holy Ghost takes us through praise the name of the Lord real things a real issue praise the name of the Lord life it's not an assumption he takes you through that condition a good example is about Abraham God didn't just assume Abraham loves me and obeys me a lot but he told Abraham take your son your only son and give him a sacrifice to me praise the name of our Lord and then Abraham woke up in the morning he didn't tell anybody what he was going to do but he told the servants you carried firewood carried the fire he told Isaac let us go to worship and then he moved for about 3 days or so and then when he reached somewhere God showed him with the mountain say that's the place I want you to sacrifice Isa ABR now didn't start saying oh God but this is my only son no he didn't he didn't buy time to wait maybe God will forget what he has told he woke up in the morning he woke up in the morning showing his obedience to what God has told him and even when he reached and God showed him the mountain say now AB I know you are serious you stop here he allowed him to go until he reached the place he laid the altar he bundled up his son and then he got a knife to cut [Music] his not an assumption and then the Lord say don't don't don't have seen that you do this praise the name of the Lord so the holy spirit is our teacher praise the name of our Lord he teaches us and go gives us the grace to go through all these things praise the name of our Lord now in the message day what is the Holy Ghost he says Now The Advocate found in 1 John 2: we can first go and pick that scripture in first John 1 John 2 verse1 and verse verse one and verse two I think we may end up with that and then next time the Lord being gracious can go in the Holy Ghost being a comforter as the intercessor and the high priest interceding for us so now in first John 2 verse1 verse2 the scripture says my little children these things right I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world praise the name of the Lord so he says my little children I write unto you that you sin not now you look at that scripture is very interesting he says don't sin but that's not the end of the scripture but it says if in man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous so in other words if you sin that's not your end praise the name of Lord he says we have an advocate we have a comforter so what do you do you say Lord have mercy upon Lord deliver me from this kind of weakness praise the name of our Lord because he's our comforter he our advocate he is our enaer praise the name of the Lord now don't allow Satan to make you do something wrong and after you have done something wrong then Satan tells you this is your end now or leave church or destroy yourself not because they there are things which are very strange I think I heard of somebody here in ginger sometime I think either he was a pastor or somebody he was adulter and then afterwards he committed suicide what was he preaching about Grace praise the name of our Lord how do you preach about Grace for you that Grace cannot come and help you now it does not mean that you do that because there is Grace but the thing is if you have really met Christ in times of weakness we have a high priest praise the name of our Lord you said Lord help me in dist Lord deliver in this kind of condition like David he committed adultery and then he killed and now when the prophet comes to him and the prophet tells him theable you know when it is a parable and you don't have the understanding of it you are self right yes that's what David was he had committed adultery he had mured was comfortable one whole year then the prophet came and gave him that Parable it was a book which is sealed just like the book is sealed when they read that baptized in the name of the father the Son and the Holy Ghost they say we doing what Jesus say but it's a parable to them it is sealed to them and they are saying that I've done what Jesus said because it is still sealed but now when the prophet broke the seal David knew I'm the man who needs to be to repent so even these people when they are looking at that mystery self they get Revelation they know that they need to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so under under the seal when the book was still sealed as a parable David said that man who did that needs to be killed he had already made judgment but now when the prophet told him you are the man he made his F but said Lord have upon me praise the name of Lord much as I did answer the other thing foolishly I committed adultery I killed even sentencing I said that person needs to die but now I find myself what do I do Lord have Mery upon me praise the name of our Lord that's where the advocate comes in and then the prophet told this King God has forgiven you he has taken away your sin and you're not going to die we need an advocate praise the name of Lord and an advocate works when you admit your weaknesses like we talked about recognizing your weaknesses acknowledging your weaknesses like in the scripture in Psalms 51 praise the name of our Lord where David says I knowledge I confess he says Psalms 51 and verse three for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before [Music] me so you tell the vate your weaknesses your failures Lord this is where I need your help Lord this is where I need your deliverance praise the name of the Lord we have an advocate with the father our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so see that you confess to the Lord you reconcile to the Lord praise the name of the Lord so that the Lord can come and help us may God bless you amen we shall continue it next week
