Seven thunder message because you are make us to know. It is this div mystery truth that will literally turn the heart of the children back to the apostolic and exactly so. We thank you for the way you are stare our hearts. in remembrance of the things that you are given through the prophets to give to us. And we thank you for the blessing you are delivered to us. We have come again under your feet to feast on the bread of life that come down from heaven Lord. We are trusting you. We are depending upon you. We are calling upon your name. Feed our soul that our soul will be filled. that every cup will be filled, every soul will be healed, every person will be healed. That at the end of this service, Father, there will not be a favor with our mid. This is our prayer. This is our asking. This our longing, this our request. I pray grant it onto us in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. As we are standing on our feet, I want us to turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 2 because the pastor had told me that we are going to have a prayer line. Okay. Second Corinthian chapter 1. 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 18- 24. But as God is true, our word towards you was not a name. For the son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Sylvanas and Timotus, was not and but in him was here. For all the promise of God in him are here and in him amen to the glory of God by us. Now he which establishes you in uh establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God. who has also sealed us and given the eness of the spirit in our hearts. Moreover, I call God for a record upon your soul and to spare you, I came not as unto courage. Not for that we have dominion over your face, but are helper of your joy. For by faith you stand. Father we bless your name for this word in Jesus name. We have our seat &gt;&gt; this our evening from where we read from in second Corinthian chapter 2 I mean 1 verse 18 down 24. I want to take a test and call it faith. Our ticket victory. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Our ticket to victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before I came to Uganda here after I have assessed my visa. The airline told me aine, &gt;&gt; they need a certified ticket. And for me to acquire that ticket, I have to present something before they can give me tickets. And the thing I have to present was money. And they told me how much it will take me to take them to take me to Uganda. Uganda. &gt;&gt; So when I release the money, they send my ticket to me. And because they have sent the ticket to me now, I was qualified to board their plane. So I went to the airport. I went to their office. They check my whatever they check my name. They saw my name. I have paid the money and I show them the ticket that they claim me. I qualify to enter that aine. That's why they brought me here. It was the tickets that I paid for that brought me to Uganda. So that's why I want to preach this. Faith is our ticket to your victory. Once you have that faith, you have got the ticket. All victory. Faith &gt;&gt; is our ticket. All victory. All victory. I'll be listing the victory one by one. Because when we talk about faith, there is no way you can operate with God outside of faith. He that come to God is a must. It's a must. You must believe. Believe in God is a must. No, you shall the only way you can access God is by faith. &gt;&gt; And that is why you sitting down here, me standing here, we are here by faith. [Applause] We can't stand the way we stand. You can't see the way you sit without faith. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm telling you this evening, faith is your victory is your ticket. All victory when you can have faith. There is no victory you cannot enjoy. And that is why if there were people that supposed to have faith today, you and me because we are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if anybody still doubting it that you are not the bride. This message of the hour is strictly to the bride. Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This message is to the bride. &gt;&gt; If you are not the bride of Jesus, &gt;&gt; you will not accept the message because it's a message that God has sent to call his wife. And when we talk about husband and wife, we talk about love. It is love that brings courtship. It is love that brings obedience. It is love that brings marriage. And that is where we are heading to. That's where we are heading to. &gt;&gt; That's where we are heading to. &gt;&gt; Heading to heading to &gt;&gt; the marriage supper of the lamb. Now listen, love is not something that we learn. It's part of us &gt;&gt; because God is love and we are part of God. So if you are part of God, we are part of everything that God is. That's why Jesus when he was here say I am the light of the world. When he was going, he point to us that we are the light. We are the light because anything God is, we are part of it. Because the Bible says for he pleased the father that the fullness of the godhead will dwell in him and we are complete in him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't separate us from God. &gt;&gt; You can't separate God from us. &gt;&gt; We are part of one another. This is the mind of God. That is why when God roll out his program, roll rolled out his program. Rolled out rolled out. When he roll out his program, it started with marriage. Marriage is God's program. The reason God made this word, he made this word to take a bride. That is the reason God made this word. He made his word to take a church which is his bride out of the church. That is the most important on earth and important. &gt;&gt; The most important on earth and that is why he started in the garden of Eden with marriage. He was rolling out his plan. Do you know why Adam followed the woman? Follow the woman. Now &gt;&gt; Adam &gt;&gt; was not deceived. &gt;&gt; It was a woman &gt;&gt; that was deceived into transgression. Adam was not deceived. This is why when God want to put the blame because of Adam's head, he call it Adam's transgression. Adam was not the one that transgressed. But because Adam followed the woman Adam's transgression, you know better. You know better. Why did Adam follow the woman? Because God when he made a man, Adam did not tell God that he need a wife. No, it was God that said, "It's no good for a man to be alone. He make Adam to sleep. He took a ri from Adam. He made the woman. He took the feminine spirit from Adam. He put it on the woman and he brought the woman to Adam. When Adam see the woman, he said, "This is bone of my bone, the flesh of my flesh, you shall be called woman." Adam name woman [Music] &gt;&gt; because she he was in the likeness of Adam &gt;&gt; just as Adam was in the likeness of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did Adam follow the woman? Because the low part of Adam was taken from him and put on that woman. So the woman is in love part of a man. So because of the love that Adam have on the world. This is the reason Adam forsake the earth. He forsook the earth. He forsook life. He forsook everything and he followed the woman. What make follow the woman? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all it because of love and that's why love is a very strong thing until the Bible says love covered multitude of sin. Love heal. Love delivers in God's economy. Love is one of the greatest weapon. When you receive the love of God in your heart, nothing can conquer you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing, greatest thing in God's economy is love. &gt;&gt; And that is why in this last days, &gt;&gt; love is so scarce. Yes, love is so scared &gt;&gt; that it will only be found &gt;&gt; in the midst of the illlet. Only Christian can love. If you are not a Christian, you cannot love. This is why we will talk about forgiveness. Only Christian can forgive love, &gt;&gt; it's a serious thing &gt;&gt; and it's a strong thing and God is love. The reason you see war everywhere in the world today is lack of love. in the church. The reason you see competition is lack of love. &gt;&gt; Competition is lack of love &gt;&gt; in the church. The reason you see superiority is lack of love. &gt;&gt; Love is lacking. is so scarce &gt;&gt; that it is only found in the midst of the elites. Only the saints can love. So from the beginning it was a love affair. It was love that make Adam forsook the world, forsook life and he followed the wife. It is the same thing today. That's why God himself because of love he left his kingdom. He left his kingdom. He came down for you and me with his love. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He left his his his comfort and he came to for you and me. That's what the Bible says. For God so loved the world that the game is only because the most valuable thing in heaven because of love God release it. The most important thing in heaven because of love God release it. And that is why when you find grace &gt;&gt; to have an understanding of what the love of God is all about, you will not have an enemy. [Music] You will know there's only one enemy. Your brother can never be your enemy. Why? Because you will know is a creator of God. Whatever situation he is, it is the devil will you without understanding [Applause] and that's what we have been taught without law nobody enter heaven the enter heaven is divine law when the prophet William was taken to the paradise to the sixth dimension. The voice told me nothing enter [Music] what is divine law. Divine law because there are different kind of love. Every man that is born by a woman. He have feel your love in his spirit. And that feel love is the love he have for his friends, for his children, for his wife. That love is political. He's selfish. That's not God. Everybody sit down here. You have love as safe in your spirit. That's not God. The love I'm talking about, it has to come from your soul. If your soul is not from God, you cannot have that love because we talk about love. You have to be a part of love. For love to be a part of you and the only way that can happen, you have to be the gene of God. And the G of God in you is your soul. And that your G is the word of God. And that is the word that hear the word of God and make you receive the word of God because the Bible says when the deep call to the deep to respond. So if you don't have that deep, no response. No response. You can't respond to God. That's why Jesus was saying when my sheep hear my voice Jesus have his own sheep. &gt;&gt; In fact what Jesus have &gt;&gt; his sheep. Everyone that is of God is a sheep because he is a shepherd. A shepherd does not shepherd goats. He doesn't shepherd cow. No, &gt;&gt; he's a shepherd because he shepher sheep. That's why the sheep in Psalm 100 verse three. Psalm 100 verse3 100 it is like this. He said know ye that the Lord is God. He's the one that made us not we ourself. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. We are sheep of his pasture. And when a sheep is the only animal that when he's lost, he cannot find his way. This is why he needs a leader. And the leader of the sheep is the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost. And that is why when we were lost, God sent forth the Holy Ghost to go and be looking for us just the way he was looking for Adam in the Garden of Eden, he was looking for us. Let me tell you something. Do you know &gt;&gt; that when Adam &gt;&gt; transgress when Adam transgressed &gt;&gt; and he was separated from God? The Bible says Adam and wife they saw fig leaves together and they covered themselves. They were they cover themselves with the fig leaves. Adam was comfortable with the fig leaves. The wife was comfortable with the fig leaves. They were not having any problem until they heard the voice of God. Until they heard the voice of God. When they heard the voice of God, Adam do two things. He ran away. Why? Because he was afraid. But when he saw fig leaves, he was not afraid. That is to show you any man. Whatever you are doing, you will be satisfied. When you hear the voice of God, when you hear the voice of God, is he want to tell you if you are right or wrong. That's what the Bible says. There is a way that see right to a man. A man never know the way is wrong until you hear the voice of God. The voice of God will expose you if you are right or wrong. You will not know you are wrong until you hear the voice of God. Because the voice of God is the only thing that is right. So when you are right, he will encourage you. When you are wrong, he will condemn you. &gt;&gt; And that is why when Adam heard the voice, &gt;&gt; he hide himself. He was afraid. That's why when we are in the presence of God and God is speaking, it bring a secret atmosphere. Put fear in your heart because the Bible says the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. That's what God does. His presence is pres atmosphere. a sacred atmosphere that make you to be scared. That's why there is nobody can stand the voice of God physically. This is why God choose to use men choose to use men to speak. And that's why even when men are anointed and they are speaking the voice of God and you are not right with that voice they condemnation you that you will know this is not a man talking to me. This is the word of God because it is only the word of God that have the capability to change your heart to check your heart because he's living and powerful and is a designer of the thoughts and the intent of men. That is the power of the word of God. I get that from. &gt;&gt; So what am I saying? &gt;&gt; It was love &gt;&gt; that made Adam fulfilled everything. &gt;&gt; And that is why marriage should be based on love. The foundation of marriage is love. The prophet taught us When a woman marry a man and he doesn't love him, when rapture comes, when rapture comes, during rapture, that woman will not go with that man. If a man marry a woman outside of love, when rapture come and that woman goes, the man will not go. Anything that does not love you the way you are go with the rapture. And that is why when we talk about marriage, the foundation of marriage is love. &gt;&gt; When you see a man and you don't love him, don't marry him. Because it will be difficult for you to be obedient to him. &gt;&gt; It is love that brings obedience. Is love that brings obedience. When you love somebody, you will not like to hurt the person. That is why the Bible says every man should love his wife the way he love himself because you cannot mit yourself who can here you will nourish and cherish yourself. That is the way a man should do to his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a commandment and it's an instruction that when you are planning to get married, marry a woman that you love. And let me tell you something about love. You have feeling there is a bond. He has a bond magnet. When you come close to person you love, there's an attraction. It's an attraction. For example, if you see a young man that is looking for a wife in this place now, when you see a woman in love, she may not be the most beautiful. She may not be the most educated. She may not be the most rich, but there's something about that woman. Anytime you come around that woman there is an impulse attraction if that thing is not there. [Music] So when you are hearing the prophet said marry a believer go beyond that marry a believer that you love. Don't marry a believer you does not love. Because there will be problem. 10 women will be here. 10 women. There is one that you have attraction to. Who the attraction bond that is the affection? What is the affection? Is love. And that is why when that is there, you will not like to mreat her because when you mreat her, you will be feeling it. When she's feeling pain, you'll be feeling it because she's part of you. It is the same thing with Christ. This is why when the word of God came to us in the way of the reveal word though it was criticized we saw it and we accepted it because there was something brought to it. This is love. We love him because he's the one that fought for love us. [Applause] Therefore, because we love him, we surrender to him. We accepted him. &gt;&gt; It is love that make you accept the message because the message is criticized is despised, is rejected, but still you receive it. Love &gt;&gt; is because you are part of it. is part of you. There's something that comes and you embrace it. The more he correct you, the more you love him because love is corrective. &gt;&gt; God said, I rebuke and chasing those that I love. &gt;&gt; This is love and that is why The more he corrects you, &gt;&gt; the more you follow him because you know &gt;&gt; is love that's what makes it correct you. I used to tell people if you are a Bible reader when Jesus want to choose 12 disciple he went to the mountain he prayed all night. When Jesus came down from the mountain, he choose 12 disciples. He called them apostles. &gt;&gt; Out of the 12 disciple choose, &gt;&gt; Judas was there. Judas was there. I want to show you what love is. I want &gt;&gt; I want to show you what love is. There is no way &gt;&gt; Jesus ever rebuked Judas. &gt;&gt; Nowhere. But Peter Jesus look at him say, "Get behind me." Jesus was constantly calling Peter Satan until when Jesus said one person will betray him. Everybody was looking at Peter because they know that Peter is the Satan they always rebuke. Nobody suspect Judas because Jesus never corrected him. He cannot rebuke it because Bible says I rebuke those that are here and the love of God is love because God loves you. Because you love you to God love you, he will not choose to. So the love of God is election. He created you and choose you for salvation. only one time. Do you know that it was Judas when Mary went to buy the alabaster oil the leper? When he came to pour the alabaster oil on Jesus body, Judah was hungry. He was annoyed until he did not stop it. He told Jesus, he said, "Why this waste? Why this? Why this waste? This oil would have been sold and we will give the money to the poor." Judah was advising Jesus. &gt;&gt; He was advising Jesus. This is a waste oil very expensive. It would have been sold and we will give the money to the poor and they wasting it on you. Jesus look at Judah. He said friend you have the poor always. He said but me they don't have always. This thing this woman is for my bail. Any time this gospel is preached, it will be said about her as a memorial. He did not rebuke Judas. He didn't rebuke him. He said, "Friend, that thing that Judas said to Jesus is not up to what Peter used to say. What did Jesus say? What did Peter say? When Jesus said they are coming to take me, Peter shall not allow them over my dead body. I will die with you anything then Jesus say somebody that try to protect you, you are coming because you didn't ser the things of God. You suffer the men get behind me. &gt;&gt; Judas &gt;&gt; was complaining that was poured upon Jesus. It was not the one that brought the oil. It was not his money. Somebody just came and give Jesus and he call it a waste and Jesus did not rebuke him. So when you come to church or you do anything wrong and God did not talk to you, you are in a terrible condition. [Applause] You are in a terrible condition because God, he always talk to this one that he love because he's rebuking you. He's chasing you so that you can be partaker of his holiness. He rebuke is not punishment. It's chastisement. It is for you to be partaker of his holy name. He wants you to look at him. &gt;&gt; He didn't rebuke Judas. That was why when he told them, "One of you will betray me." Everybody Judas, you were looking at Peter. It was Peter Peter. When everybody was on him, he not I love Jesus. He asked John, John, as Jesus, who is the one? John said, "Master, who is the one?" He said, "The one that will dip the hand with me. When I dip my hand, do you know that the moment Jesus deep his hand, Judah deep his hand, &gt;&gt; he was so trusted that nobody think he's the one. He was he has never rebuked him. deep not be Judas Judas. &gt;&gt; Then he look at it he say friend what you do do quickly because he's always calling him friend. Judas was the only person Jesus called friend. Then you begin to wonder why was Jesus calling him free? Because to begin with is a son of addition and he's a son of pity. There is nothing you can do to save him. He come from hell. He must go back to hell. Jesus know this. All what he had for him was encouragement. It is the same thing. It's the same thing when you have this understanding. When you see people outside, you will not be treating them bad because you know they are object of pity. You will see men inside big big jeep. They enjoying the pleasures of the world. where you have contact with the heavenly when you see them you beating them. &gt;&gt; But that's not the case. Many of us when we look at them we want to be copying them. It's because you lack understanding. They are object of pity. And that's what many of the simple life you are living. They cannot live it. They can't no way they can do it. And that's why nothing to envy in them. They object of pity. The only hope they have is on this earth. They live like animals. They die like animals. And when they die, the Bible say death will feed on them feed on them. But your case and my case is not like that. In us, we have a deposit of internal life. A life that does not have a beginning and cannot end. This is what the grace of God gave to us. That's our salvation. And that is what says if on this earth alone we have hope for all men most miserable. But we have hope here. We have hope in glory. Christ glory. And that's why when our time here is about to finish, when our time is about to finish, then God send our theophony to carry us away to his presence. And while you are here living, he need to feed on the world with peace, with joy, with righteousness. happiness, but then they don't have it. And that is why many of them it used to be very difficult for them to release money for you because they know what they went through and you are just you are just enjoying your life. People want to partake of sweat that I went through. Even when you have a brother who is in that category, he will hardly be giving you money, he just give you because when he look, no peace, no joy, no happiness. The only thing is this money. So what am I bringing? They can acquire everything under heaven. Because the Bible says money answer all things but they cannot acquire peace. &gt;&gt; Money cannot give you peace because peace is not on earth heaven. So as money can acquire things under this economy that is how faith can acquire things economy faith is stronger than money. Money cannot give you faith. Faith can give you money. This is why I say faith is your ticket to all victory. All this promise in the Bible, it belongs to a Christian. And that is why the only way you can accept the promise is by faith [Music] and faith come by hearing hearing by the word of the Lord. This is why you see Pentecost they have too many words. Do you know why? Every promise in the Bible that has to bring about materialism, they search it because Jesus said the scripture for him there you think you have eternal life. The pentecost when they look at the Bible all what they want to see is what can give them physically. God said, God said, God said, and they are getting it, God said. Anything God said, when you have faith in it, you will get it. &gt;&gt; Because faith is our ticket to the victory of good life. If you want to live a good life, a happy life, use your faith. The promise is already there. God can't bring you second time. What can make you receive it is faith. There is nothing you cannot get if you have faith. In fact, there is no miracle that faith cannot do. The Bible say through faith &gt;&gt; you can quench every fid of the wicked. Through faith you can move mountain. So when you see what making them to stand tall and have faith in what God promised to today if there's a church under heaven that have faith said they have a living faith and this is what you and me need. [Music] You and me need it. &gt;&gt; This is what you and me need to live a better life. This is what you and me need to live a well life. This is what you and me need to make the rapture because without faith you can make rapture and that's why brother said in message I want you to get built up in this holy oracle the faith of this hour of the hour All that you have seen, all that you have heard, accumulate them and build because we are going to need more faith. Only faith has ever happened that heaven to make the rapture. So to make the rapture is by faith. Salvation is by faith. Healing is by faith. When you want physical, you want by faith. That is the way God has placed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is why brothers when you go to the book of Revelation chapter 13 verse 8. He said all will be deceived. All will be deceived &gt;&gt; except those that have their name in the land. They want to ask you a question. How do you know your name is in the last book of life? &gt;&gt; How do you know? &gt;&gt; How do you know? &gt;&gt; It's by faith. &gt;&gt; It's by faith. Because when you open the Bible, brother, your name is Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Are you not Jeremiah? &gt;&gt; I'm Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; When the Bible opened, he say if I say the book of Jeremiah, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you. is Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; But if I say the book of Jeremiah, I'm not talking about him because we know there is there was one Jeremiah. Do you know why I know it's not Jeremiah? Because that Jeremiah was a prophet and he suffer. This one is not a prophet and he has not suffered. Have you suffered? &gt;&gt; Did you suffer in the hand of King of Babylon? Do you know what Babylon is? [Laughter] But let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; But everything that is said about Jeremiah by faith you can claim it and you defer to him. &gt;&gt; And that is why will you see any character in the Bible that you love. Remove that character and put your name. When you put your name, the thing you desire about that character will come to you. &gt;&gt; That's what that will confess. &gt;&gt; So when we are talking about healing, the Bible says by his stripes you is not a person's name. &gt;&gt; You carry your name. push them. You say judge by his strip is healed and say God thank you. &gt;&gt; You have collected it and because you collect it and you believe it, God give it to you. What give it to you. So every promise in the book belongs to you. If only you can believe. &gt;&gt; This is what faith does. Faith is your ticket to enjoy every blessing because this blessing Jesus has paid for every one of us. He has paid he has released it. The only way you can assess it is by faith. And that's why I don't care how Satan is troubling you. How Satan is troubling you in the way of sin. Tell him no, &gt;&gt; I am saved. Tell Satan I am saved because by his stripe I was healed. He was wounded for my transgression. If you like carry me to a prostitute house, if you like, carry me to a prostitute house. Take me to sleep with the prostitute. When Satan know You know what you are talking about, he will leave you. [Applause] Every man that can hold to God's promise are a bad market to Satan. Bad market a Satan don't deal with bad markets. &gt;&gt; He don't deal with bad markets. Every true believer in God is a bad market to Satan. He will leave you. This is the problem. What God wants. &gt;&gt; Take me by my ways. &gt;&gt; I have given it to you. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; And will you take it? Don't look at any other thing. Set your eye on the promise. You will enter into the victory. &gt;&gt; This message of the hour by faith you have accepted it. I want to say it as I'm standing here. If everybody backslide, if everybody bus me I cannot lead. &gt;&gt; This is why I sang that song just now. &gt;&gt; Jesus is only is the only friend I have. All my heart is for him. So where will I go? To whom will I go? I believe and I am sure this is eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the way God want you to believe. When you are coming to God, you should not have eternity. When you have eternality, you are not believed. &gt;&gt; You have not believed. A man that believe God does not have alternative. God is the only alternative. When you go to God like that, you can never go the way you are. He will go with testimony because the Bible says as many that put their trust in him shall never be put to shame. &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that he will use to prove his word and he can only use a believer to prove his word. Brother now God raised dead. &gt;&gt; There is no sickness. He has paid for it. All you need to do only believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is it money? &gt;&gt; Is it material? &gt;&gt; Is it financial faith will open you for you is looking for men who will take it by his word. They will see God. God is a man of action. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Action when you have come to God believe is finished. &gt;&gt; And that's why &gt;&gt; as we are calling prayer line this evening you that will stay in the prayer line. Don't go to prayer line to test. Go to prayer to receive. It's not a test. It's not a test. This is a place of receiving as that come to him. He will know why cast them out. He will grant the heart. So when you are coming, I'm coming to receive. That is the purpose because he have it to give to you. In fact, he has given it to you. You are only coming to receive what belong to you, healing, deliverance, blessing is the children's bread. God has paid for it at Calvary. That's why Jesus said it is finished. So when you have needs, you come to him. Father, you said you said you said and when God check what he said, he confirm it. He's there confirming what he said. I'm closing with this. I was hearing the pastor now. I was hearing the pastor. He was talking about some bed that used to go to the prison to preach. Where are the here? Let me see your hand. People that go to prison to preach. God bless you brother. Any other one? I want to give you one testimony. I have a prison ministry. When I enter the prison to be preaching to them, I told them all the inmates, I said, "Anybody here that will believe what I brought to this prison, I brought deliverance. The day you will believe what I'm preaching, you will not sleep in this prison. That day, you'll be free." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen, &gt;&gt; I say you have been receiving pastors here. &gt;&gt; You have been receiving pastors here. The message I brought is not like other pastor's message. Jesus came to set the captives free. So when you are here, you believe what I bring. Not a make believe from your heart. You will not sleep in this prison. Now listen. Then that's how it started. And they gave me a nickname. They call me pastor. Amen. And amen. So when I come, they say pastor. Amen. And amen. I say amen is the finish point of the when you believe and amen your time in prison finish. Now listen then what started he was a Muslim when I threw that challenge when I threw the challenge then he open his heart. &gt;&gt; This is the Bible before me. I lay my hand on it. The day that boy surrendered to the message, he was free from the prison. Now listen, sir, now listen. I was at home. A number called me. I said this, I don't know him. He said, "Pastor from prison." He mention his name. There are many I don't know their name. He said, "I want to see you. Then I made myself available. I make myself available to him. Then he came to me. He said I come to you now because you said anybody that believe what you preach in the prison we not sleep in the prison. He said when I believe he said I that was the week I left the prison. That's what I'm looking for you. He said what is the next thing? He said, "What is the next thing?" [Applause] I said, "You need to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that receive the power of the Holy Ghost." He said, "I want to baptize. I took him to water. I baptized him. When I baptized him, I was expecting to go. You see, I'm not going anywhere. I'll be stay with you. &gt;&gt; You'll be stay with me. Why? He said there's no place I can stay because I have never seen this kind before. He said I will be with you. Go. I go to church said I'm not going to discourage him. He said he said he said because my life is scattered. You are the one to arrange the life for me. Arrange your life. I don't have work to give you and you don't have a cut to the ministry. Then I can say okay I will betray you as then I took him. He was staying with me everywhere I'm going he be following me. He wash my car. He clean my things. He take up my house. Everything was following me. If I'm going for evangelism I will take him. Then he started dressing well. He dress the way I dress. He do the way I do things. He follow me. Then one day God opened my eyes in a vision of a night that he still have something he have to be delivered from. There is something blocking his way. He can't go forward. He can't go backward. When I wake up from that revelation his name was a Muslim boy. I was the one that call him Elijah because when I want to baptize him I said can I don't baptize you with this Muslim name. What is your name? He said I can't use to baptize you. He said I will give him name. I look at him. I say you are a legend from today. You are a liar. Say yes sir. I took it to. So when we I saw that vision about him, I took it to the church. &gt;&gt; I lay my hand upon him. I said, "Lord, you brought this boy. You show me what is his problem. I lay my hand now. That obstacle that is on his way today, I condemn it and I b the lift and all the way will be open." This is the puppet. That day I did that deliverance for him. The next day they call him from his village. king that they are looking for help. They want to employ people and in their quarter in their quarter they want to employ people in road safety federal government job and in their quarters there is no candidate available. There's no &gt;&gt; no candidate, no candidate. Then they remember that this man has left the prison but nobody know where he is. They say you should come and take the position. That same week &gt;&gt; he went to take that position. &gt;&gt; The life open. &gt;&gt; That life that doesn't have meaning &gt;&gt; took meaning shape because when he came came out from prison any time I'm going back to prison I will carry him. So he was a living testimony. All of them know him. He come with to the prison with me. This is the one I want to bring to you. Now &gt;&gt; then there was another inmate. &gt;&gt; Another inmate that one &gt;&gt; in our head saying his girlfriend. He said please look for the this pastor's go and meet him in his office. I want you to help me. The way he help Elijah. I was in the office. The guy just came. He said I want to see you pastor. I said from where? I've never seen you before. He said from prison prison. He says my boyfriend as me. I said what was it? He said he want you to help you. I said how? He said he want to leave the prison. If they look for a way to free they cannot free I said okay what will happen if I come to prison I will see him when I went to prison after finishing the day I was preaching they took him to court he was not around so when I finished that was when he was coming in they told that I just finished I'm going say pastor he said I want to see you please with chain on his leg and hand like I said what is it? He said I want to talk to you. He said please tell the water officer the welfare officer if I can come to his office that's my problem. I went to the welfare officer I said there's an office he want to see me personally he said he want to use at your office. He said no you want him. I said what? He said please. I see it. He was a very deadly inmate here. &gt;&gt; But you help him. &gt;&gt; You brought him out. Bring me out. I said bring you out. Am I a lawyer? Am I a judge? Am I a policeman? I can't bring you out. Either the law bring you out or go bring you out. Yes. Mhm. &gt;&gt; He said, but you help him. I say, you know what happened? I told you people in this prison. What I have brought to you is a message of deliverance. The day you believe it is between you and God. God know your heart. You will not sleep here. You will not sleep here. I say the same thing. When you believe, you will not sleep here. Then I left. &gt;&gt; Then he went to the prison. &gt;&gt; What is what? He now begin to ask is anything that used to preach contract. They told him. He said God I believe. Anything pastor will say I believe. I believe Lord. I believe. I was at home. The word of God is so simple. He call me because when you see a prisoner call you is because he's free because they don't have access to telephone. So he call me he said pastor where are you? I want to see you. I said who are you? He I don't know their names. He said I'm the one that say you should help me. He said you have helped me that's why I want to see you. I made myself available. I s I said you should meet me in the office. &gt;&gt; He came with that girl. &gt;&gt; Both of them came from my office. I look you said yes. He said pastor you know what happened? He said what you told me that the day I believe what you are preaching I will not sleep in the preaching. He said that week, &gt;&gt; that week, &gt;&gt; that week was my what they call it h court day. He said when they took me to court, every day they will take me to court, bring me back to the prison, take me to court, bring me back to prison. He said, but that day as I went to court, the judges turn up. He said court what's the next case? They read the case. They brought me to the counter. They brought me to the counter.

He said this my girlfriend is my wife to be two of us. I baptized them. He came out that one did not follow me. He become a member of the church in that area. What a matter to let you know God is simple you need to do that the miracle of God is believe if you want to see miracle believe one day after he become a member every time he came to meet me he said pastor what do you I said let me tell you the truth. I did not pray for you. I didn't pray. It is God that free you. This thing you are hearing is the voice of God for freedom. The day you give your heart to it. However you are deeply seen free. That is how how many will I count? &gt;&gt; Lastly, &gt;&gt; I just came from South Africa. Africa. &gt;&gt; When I came from South Africa, &gt;&gt; many people were inviting me to come to their church. I was not having leadership to go to any church. I only have leadership to go to the prison. I just gather my things. I went to the prison. As I got to the prison, I saw a prisoner. They were bringing him out. The prisoner were Oh, congratulations. Congratulations. They were because they they freed the boy. He was just free. As I'm coming, as I just coming in, they were they just freed the boy. All of them we have here. Congratulations.

Where I am staying. He call me. He said pastor I am free. Just the words of your mouth. [Applause] faith because under the anointing I ask Paul and Silas were in the prison they are free Paul who is in silence he say I am the one and that give him his victory. So when God asks, you want to receive healing, speak, you will receive it. When God asks, you want to be delivered, answer, you will be delivered. When God asks, who want to be blessed, answer, you will receive blessed. That is how God is. We walk in the light. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
