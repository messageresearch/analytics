[12:33] surrenation [music]
[12:36] of the [music and singing] nation
[12:40] of who I am. Amen. Let us give God the
[12:44] hand of praise. [applause]
[12:45] [music]
[12:46] Amen.
[12:48] We can ourselves who we are. Praise the
[12:50] name.
[12:52] Let us pray.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for this afternoon,
[12:57] for the grace again you've given unto
[12:59] us, Father, that we can come into your
[13:02] presence, Lord. How we are grateful that
[13:05] Lord,
[13:07] you've made yourself known unto us and
[13:10] that we are able to know
[13:13] that our names are written in the Lamb's
[13:15] book of life
[13:18] before the foundation of the world.
[13:20] And we're here, heavenly father, to
[13:23] respond to the calling of our names.
[13:27] You may speak to us again and help us in
[13:30] all our weaknesses and failures.
[13:33] That father, we may do that which is
[13:35] right and acceptable before.
[13:37] Bless our hearts, heavenly father. Let
[13:40] the joy of the Lord fill our hearts.
[13:43] Make yourself known unto us even more.
[13:47] We love you and we bless you, Lord.
[13:49] In the name of the Lord Jesus pray.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; Let us go back to
[13:56] second John still.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; I just we just handled only part of what
[14:05] that subject was and I feel maybe we
[14:07] just continue in the same afternoon.
[14:12] First John, 2 John rather chapter 1
[14:14] verse one verse3
[14:20] the Bible says
[14:22] the elder unto the elect lady and her
[14:24] children whom I love in the truth and
[14:28] not I only but also they that have known
[14:31] the truth.
[14:46] for the truth's sake which dwelleth in
[14:49] us and shall be with us forever.
[14:59] Grace be with you.
[15:02] Mercy, peace from God the Father and
[15:05] from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
[15:08] God in truth and in love.
[15:20] May God bless his word.
[15:25] We are still continuing with our
[15:26] subject.
[15:29] The elect lady grace.
[15:34] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[15:36] the spirit works in different ways.
[15:39] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[15:42] there is sometimes
[15:45] there's a way the spirit can work at
[15:47] this time
[15:49] and then there's also again can work in
[15:50] another time
[15:53] praise the name of our lord pastor was
[15:56] always saying
[15:58] that when brother perig was speaking
[16:02] brother perig
[16:06] would say
[16:08] those who love the church.
[16:12] Those who love the church, they come on
[16:15] Sunday morning.
[16:17] Then those who love the pastor, they
[16:19] come in the Sunday afternoon.
[16:24] Then who those who love God, they come
[16:28] on Wednesday. Praise the name of Lord.
[16:31] And then you find that every time there
[16:33] is where the spirit moves
[16:38] when it is a mixed multitude.
[16:41] There is how the spirit works.
[16:43] When it is an inner room
[16:48] when he was outside would speak a lot of
[16:50] things and not get you.
[16:53] But when he would come with the few
[16:56] then he reveals more.
[16:59] Praise the name of the Lord. We just
[17:00] need to have a desire of more of God in
[17:02] our lives.
[17:05] So now you see here that brother
[17:08] Brandham was calling the church
[17:10] misgrace.
[17:14] It's actually by the grace of God
[17:17] that we are what we are.
[17:21] It's not our ability at all.
[17:25] It's the grace that God gives us
[17:28] that you know from one year to another
[17:32] standing you are moving even when other
[17:36] people are falling away even when other
[17:38] people don't see what you see but then
[17:41] God gives you the grace that you are
[17:44] able to press on you able to stand on
[17:49] now in the message Jesus Christ the same
[17:51] yesterday done forever
[17:55] It says the first chapter of Jeremiah
[17:59] fourth verse
[18:01] I believe it is
[18:04] God said before you was even formed in
[18:07] your mother's belly.
[18:10] I knew you and called you and sanctified
[18:16] you and ordained you a prophet over the
[18:19] nations
[18:21] before he was ever born.
[18:24] You believe in predestination
[18:27] for ordination.
[18:30] You know, we could go right on down
[18:32] through the scripture.
[18:35] Yes, sir. It's all together by grace.
[18:40] It is not by our desire.
[18:43] It is by grace.
[18:46] God called Abraham
[18:48] out of the whole world of people.
[18:52] Why was it? Because Abraham was better.
[18:56] No sir, it is grace.
[18:59] God is chosen,
[19:03] election,
[19:05] and call. You are what you are.
[19:09] Because the grace of God
[19:12] has made you what you are.
[19:15] Who taking thought can add one to his
[19:17] teacher?
[19:21] Is that right? It's by grace
[19:24] these things are called
[19:27] God has set in the church.
[19:30] So now one thing we need to appreciate
[19:33] that our salvation is of the Lord.
[19:38] It's not of your ability.
[19:41] Praise the name of our Lord. It's by
[19:43] grace that God called you.
[19:47] It's by grace that God revealed himself
[19:49] to you.
[19:51] Not because you say, you know, I born
[19:53] from a religious family.
[19:56] Oh, you know, I've never done this
[19:57] thing.
[19:59] It is God himself
[20:02] that ordained the path you have to go
[20:04] through
[20:06] and then you found yourself.
[20:09] Praise the name of the Lord. There is
[20:11] something pressing you in your heart.
[20:14] Maybe let me pass this side or let me go
[20:17] to this grocery or let me listen to this
[20:20] program or let me go by that church.
[20:24] There was just something that was
[20:26] drawing him.
[20:28] You see even people who say that me I
[20:30] sought God
[20:32] it is God that puts that burden upon you
[20:36] to seek him. Praise the name of our
[20:39] Lord. You know when you read in the
[20:41] messages and even when you read in the
[20:43] scriptures
[20:45] you'll find that something God starts
[20:47] working in your life
[20:50] and then there's a desire
[20:54] something that keeps pulling you pulling
[20:56] you or sometimes you in a school and
[21:00] then there's a particular person there
[21:03] may not be the famous person may not be
[21:06] you know anything you need but you find
[21:08] you are drawn on to that person
[21:12] along the path you find that God uses
[21:15] that person for you to find a truth.
[21:19] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[21:20] God works.
[21:22] When the Lord wanted to reveal himself
[21:24] to brother Brana,
[21:28] you know, he had a burden. He started a
[21:31] burden,
[21:32] you know, and then he said, "I have to
[21:34] go and wait on the Lord.
[21:37] I cannot continue living with these
[21:38] things.
[21:40] Everybody is criticizing me and telling
[21:43] me that there's something wrong in my
[21:44] life. So he told his wife, I'm going to
[21:48] wait on the Lord. If I don't come back,
[21:51] I'm not coming back. But let me know why
[21:54] I'm sold this kind of life.
[21:57] Everybody is telling me there's
[21:58] something wrong with my life. It was a
[22:01] burden that the Lord put upon him
[22:05] because God wanted to visit him. Praise
[22:09] the name of our Lord. You see, that's
[22:10] how things work out. The Lord moves you
[22:15] to do something because there's
[22:17] something he wants to do. When the Lord
[22:20] wanted to take the gospel to the
[22:22] Gentiles,
[22:24] he moved Cornelius
[22:26] to go into a praying and a fasting
[22:28] session.
[22:30] And then when Cornelius was praying and
[22:32] fasting,
[22:34] you know, and then the angel comes down
[22:36] and says, "God has heard your prayer.
[22:39] Are you pleased with your arms?" And
[22:41] then he told him, "If you want to do
[22:44] better,
[22:45] send for Peter." And then you see on the
[22:48] other side Peter was also in praying I'm
[22:51] waiting on the Lord and then was saying
[22:54] Lord God had put a burden upon him AND
[22:58] WHEN HE KEPT ON praying he started
[23:00] feeling hungry and then a vision came
[23:04] and then it came three TIMES TELLING HIM
[23:07] SLAY and kill
[23:09] said I've never eaten such things
[23:12] and then the Bible says the Holy Spirit
[23:15] tells him
[23:17] Don't call what God has sanctified
[23:19] defiled.
[23:22] Then he started wondering what does this
[23:24] mean? And at that same time
[23:28] the men sent by Cornelius
[23:31] already knocking at the door.
[23:34] God working from either side.
[23:38] Praise the name of our Lord. He moves
[23:40] your heart to a particular section,
[23:44] you know, and then because there is a
[23:46] response
[23:48] like brother Brandon preaches, the deep
[23:51] calls the deep,
[23:54] there has to be a response
[23:56] before there is a need.
[23:58] He said, "How dare be a fish with,
[24:02] you know, with fins?
[24:11] Ah no, not scary. You know how could the
[24:14] fish swim when there's no water?
[24:19] How would the earth grow in the earth if
[24:21] the earth was not there? How would the
[24:23] tree grow in the earth if the earth was
[24:24] not there?
[24:27] So the first thing which was meant to be
[24:29] there
[24:31] is the water. And then God told the
[24:34] waters to bring forth the fish.
[24:39] the tree. How would it be there if the
[24:41] earth was not there?
[24:43] So God made the the earth and then he
[24:46] told the earth bring the trees.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So it
[24:50] starts from what is needed
[24:53] and then the need comes.
[24:56] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[24:58] the same thing in our lives.
[25:01] If you have a need, if you feel a
[25:04] burden, if you feel a desire, you have
[25:07] it because there is a response waiting.
[25:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So then
[25:13] what do you do? Lord, I'm here waiting
[25:17] to receive my response.
[25:19] Praise the name of the Lord. So now God
[25:23] in his sovereign,
[25:27] he set some to do a certain work.
[25:32] Praise the name of our Lord. He
[25:33] ordained.
[25:36] He chose.
[25:38] Praise the name of our Lord. And now we
[25:40] are in the message
[25:42] adoption.
[25:44] He says,
[25:45] &gt;&gt; "When were our names put in the lamb's
[25:48] book of life?
[25:51] When was the lamb slain before
[25:54] when the lamb was slain before the
[25:55] foundation of the world?
[25:58] When God was Jehovah,
[26:02] &gt;&gt; l
[26:05] Elohim,
[26:06] &gt;&gt; the selfexistence one,
[26:10] &gt;&gt; one like a great big diamond.
[26:16] He could not be nothing else.
[26:20] But inside of this diamond,
[26:23] his attribute
[26:25] was a savior.
[26:28] In this attribute, on the inside of him
[26:32] was a healer. Well, there was nothing to
[26:35] save and nothing to heal.
[26:41] But his attributes produced it.
[26:44] So then before the foundation of the
[26:46] world,
[26:48] when he known
[26:51] that the great display is in here of
[26:54] him,
[26:56] that he would be a savior,
[27:00] that he would come and be made flesh and
[27:02] dwelt among us.
[27:06] And he knowed and he knowed by his
[27:09] stripes would be healed.
[27:13] slain the lamb on his book
[27:17] before the foundation of the world
[27:20] and wrote your name on the book
[27:24] before the foundation of the world.
[27:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[27:29] says
[27:31] election
[27:33] looks back to for knowledge.
[27:42] and predestination
[27:46] looks to destiny.
[27:50] Now the the prophet is telling
[27:55] to be chosen.
[27:57] He had first forward knowledge.
[28:02] You know, before there was anything,
[28:05] God knew everything.
[28:08] And after knowing everything,
[28:11] he knew that Isaac would give birth to
[28:16] two sons,
[28:18] the first born Esau,
[28:20] the second born Jacob
[28:23] is for one knowledge.
[28:25] So
[28:28] even if he's the first born,
[28:32] even if he's loved by his father,
[28:35] you despise the firstborn, the
[28:37] birthight,
[28:42] he knew that
[28:45] with every opportunity he had, he never
[28:48] regretted the things of God
[28:51] until when it came the time of his
[28:53] marriage.
[28:55] He was maring around the place.
[28:58] Neighbor's daughter here, the other one
[29:01] there, the other one there until it
[29:04] became grievious to his father.
[29:08] That was Esau.
[29:11] So God by forward knowledge
[29:16] that he wouldn't care about the God.
[29:19] He would care about his choices.
[29:22] So now the foreign knowledge of God
[29:26] made God
[29:28] to reject Esau
[29:32] and elect Jacob.
[29:36] Even Jacob had his weaknesses.
[29:39] BUT GOD by foreign knowledge
[29:42] he chose Jacob. And then he said Jacob
[29:46] have love.
[29:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Then now
[29:54] after he has chosen
[29:57] then he predestinates
[30:01] he determines the destiny.
[30:05] He determined the destiny of Jacob.
[30:10] And then he say for Jacob's destiny to
[30:13] be there,
[30:16] I must reveal my secret
[30:20] to the mother
[30:22] and tell the mother, "The younger
[30:27] shall rule the older,
[30:29] but the father, my son is Esau.
[30:33] We go with him to hunting.
[30:36] He doesn't stay in the house like Jacob.
[30:39] That means going all the time.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; So what did God do?
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Isaac, a prophet,
[30:48] &gt;&gt; you know, he gave birth to these
[30:49] children when he was 40 years.
[30:53] And Isaac lived for many years older
[30:56] than even Abraham.
[30:58] Think about60 or something years.
[31:02] But now when you look at this,
[31:07] you'll find that almost half of Isaac's
[31:11] life,
[31:14] he was blind.
[31:17] But he was a prophet OF GOD.
[31:20] SO GOD to make the destiny come to pass
[31:27] to become blind.
[31:30] Blind
[31:33] So that the blessing
[31:36] would pass on to Jacob
[31:39] not
[31:41] &gt;&gt; the father loves
[31:43] praise the name of our lord and the
[31:46] mother knew
[31:47] he was there in the house when the
[31:50] father was telling his son
[31:53] my son I'm
[31:58] here in
[32:02] your father wants to give you land
[32:05] and he says that you bring
[32:08] and then for you refuse.
[32:13] So even Isaac
[32:16] told the son give me that meal which is
[32:19] very good
[32:22] and hunt and bring for me and I eat
[32:25] then I bless you my son.
[32:28] Now before that
[32:31] had sold his birthight for food
[32:36] he sold his birth to Jacob.
[32:39] Jacob was just an opportunistic
[32:44] just waiting there on the door.
[32:59] Then he tells the son, "My son, your
[33:03] father wants to bless Isa,
[33:06] but now my son, I want you now. I'm you
[33:10] can bring a a a lamp.
[33:14] I dress it for you the way your father
[33:17] likes
[33:19] and then you take to your father and he
[33:22] blesses you instead of
[33:25] Isaac was there waiting for
[33:28] But the mother was doing something
[33:30] different.
[33:31] Then Jacob said, "My mother, supposing
[33:34] my father discover that I'm not the one,
[33:37] I will be cast."
[33:39] No, it will be upon me only do what I'm
[33:42] going to do.
[33:44] So she finishes cooking,
[33:47] tells him, "You come." Then he puts the
[33:50] wool
[33:51] because body was hairy.
[33:55] And then after some time he comes,
[33:59] I'm your son.
[34:02] Yes, you've got the the kill very fast.
[34:07] You come here and I smell you.
[34:10] Then it touches him. He says, "Yeah, he
[34:13] smells the field.
[34:15] The border is my son." But the voices of
[34:18] Jacob
[34:21] said, "I'm the one."
[34:23] is a prophet and brother Brandham tells
[34:26] us that God does not show his prophets
[34:29] everything
[34:32] like Jacob
[34:34] the death of the saint telling him that
[34:36] Joseph is dead.
[34:40] God never revealed him anything
[34:43] until they came and told him that Joseph
[34:45] is in Egypt
[34:47] and then God told him you are going to
[34:50] touch his face.
[34:53] But all those years he never told him.
[34:58] So God had prepared the path we go
[35:01] through.
[35:03] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[35:05] the same thing that God works out in our
[35:07] lives
[35:09] that everything that comes to your life
[35:13] is ordained of God.
[35:17] Please find the goodness of God
[35:20] in the challenges that you face
[35:23] in the troubles that you go through.
[35:25] Lord, where is your path in this?
[35:28] Lord, what you desire me to do in this
[35:30] life?
[35:32] Praise the name of God. So then he says
[35:35] that predestination
[35:38] looks to destiny.
[35:41] So God had to prepare.
[35:45] Isaac should be blind.
[35:51] Despise this and this.
[35:54] And now when Isaac
[35:57] blessed Jacob
[35:59] not knowing
[36:02] and then his son came with the food
[36:08] the started trembling
[36:11] the father started trembling
[36:14] said what have I done said your
[36:17] brother's been here I'm the brother I'm
[36:20] the one said I've already blessed
[36:24] He said, "Isn't there another blessing
[36:25] left for me?" He said, "What is left for
[36:28] you? You're going to serve him because
[36:31] I've already blessed that you he's going
[36:33] to be ruler."
[36:35] And now Esau
[36:38] determined to kill Jacob
[36:42] in his heart. And the Bible says, "God
[36:47] revealed to Rebecca
[36:50] the heart of Esau.
[36:53] Then Rebecca told Jacob, "Run to my
[36:56] father."
[36:58] So God was preparing the path to go
[37:01] through.
[37:03] Then you look at the life of Jacob.
[37:06] When he goes to the well, Rachel comes
[37:09] with the animals, he helps her, then he
[37:12] goes to Laban's place.
[37:15] And then when he's there, after he had
[37:17] worked for a number of years,
[37:20] he says, "I want to get a wife.
[37:22] Because the mother told him you go and
[37:24] marry from her the daughters there
[37:27] and then the father tells him seven
[37:30] years.
[37:34] Praise the name of our lord. So is
[37:37] scripture.
[37:40] Praise the name of our lord. It is
[37:42] there. And you know when your time of
[37:45] marriage has come,
[37:48] you prove that your worth
[37:52] is the name of
[37:55] that you are worth to take somebody's
[37:56] daughter
[37:59] and you don't hate that family because
[38:00] of the charging
[38:06] people.
[38:09] They think I'm just going to work for
[38:10] them. You love the daughter.
[38:13] negotiate with them.
[38:16] Negotiate with them.
[38:19] Praise the name of So we are not going
[38:22] to preach that is unscriptural.
[38:27] Praise the name of our Lord. you know,
[38:29] of course,
[38:36] but if you choose to go where they pay,
[38:41] it's your choice. Praise the name of
[38:46] Yeah. So, you can't negotiate with them.
[38:54] He doesn't know what lies ahead.
[38:56] [laughter]
[39:03] You know that is scripture.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; But now I'm not saying you overcharge.
[39:12] Praise the name of our Lord. So now he
[39:15] had to work seven years.
[39:19] And when he worked seven years,
[39:22] the Bible says they seemed as a short
[39:25] time.
[39:27] Now you see the mind of God
[39:30] in the scriptures in the book of
[39:32] revelation.
[39:34] You know the Bible says in Hebrews
[39:36] chapter 11
[39:38] that Abraham
[39:40] was looking for a city
[39:42] whose maker and builder.
[39:48] He kept on looking for the city. He knew
[39:51] the city is there. He kept on looking
[39:53] for it. But he didn't know.
[39:57] THAT THE FOUNDATION OF THAT CITY,
[40:01] praise the name of our Lord, and the
[40:03] gates of that city
[40:06] where the 12 patriarchs
[40:10] and the 12 apostles.
[40:13] He didn't know that
[40:15] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says
[40:18] that the foundation
[40:21] had the names of the apostles
[40:26] and the gates
[40:28] had the names of the tri 12 tribes of
[40:30] Israel.
[40:33] SO HOW COULD THAT CITY BECOME actual
[40:39] without the 12 tribes of Israel?
[40:44] So God
[40:45] had to harden the heart of Laban.
[40:50] Praise the name of our Lord. And when
[40:52] the time to give away came
[40:58] just put their layer.
[41:03] By the morning you realize this is not
[41:05] Rachel.
[41:10] Then
[41:12] preach his
[41:19] go and marry when the elder has not
[41:22] believe in those doctrines at home
[41:28] you know my elder sister
[41:31] let her first go then I will go no it
[41:34] should not be like that
[41:37] and so for another seven years
[41:41] He worked for Rachel.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; But the whole thing God wanted to get
[41:48] the 12 tribes of Israel
[41:53] for 14 years.
[41:57] The first seven years with Leia, no
[41:59] birth.
[42:02] When he gets Rachel, no birth.
[42:08] Then he opened the womb of Leia.
[42:11] She gives the first birth. But she's
[42:13] hated by the husband,
[42:17] gives the second birth, second, third.
[42:22] Then Rachel says, "Let me give my mate."
[42:30] So you find that Jacob had no interest
[42:36] to get more than one wife.
[42:40] Never the same mind of Abra Abraham.
[42:45] They never wanted.
[42:47] You see that even Isaac had a maid.
[42:51] Rebecca had a mate.
[42:54] But Isaac could not say, "Let me go to
[42:56] the maid."
[42:58] They were faithful to their voice.
[43:02] Praise the name of our Lord. They had a
[43:04] fear of God.
[43:06] So they have to live true to their
[43:08] commitment.
[43:11] So now when you look at the story OF
[43:12] JACOB,
[43:14] YOU SEE IT was ordained of God.
[43:18] When Rachel saw the sisters produce
[43:21] children,
[43:23] she told the husband, "Have my maid."
[43:28] He produced two children with the maid.
[43:31] Then Leia said, "Ah, even my maid is
[43:34] also here.
[43:36] no children.
[43:38] Now when God saw that there were 10 sons
[43:41] of Jacob,
[43:46] then he opened the womb of Rachel.
[43:50] He produced Joseph
[43:52] and there Jacob will not go to another
[43:54] woman.
[43:57] Then again another son
[44:01] and that was the end. Praise the name of
[44:03] our Lord. So he prepared his destiny,
[44:08] the things that Jacob had to go through
[44:12] to fulfill the mind of God.
[44:16] And that same thing also works in our
[44:18] lives.
[44:20] He prepares
[44:22] the path that we have to go through.
[44:25] And so it is by the grace of God.
[44:28] Praise the name of God that we are
[44:31] elected.
[44:33] Blessed be the name of our Lord. When
[44:35] you look at the story of Paul
[44:38] where he says here,
[44:43] &gt;&gt; let us go to the book of
[44:46] 2 Corinthians. I beg your pardon.
[44:58] Let us go to the book of
[45:01] second Corinthians.
[45:14] I think I never put it here.
[45:17] Praise the name of Let me just get it
[45:18] here
[45:21] in the scriptures where I wrote it.
[45:23] First Timothy,
[45:30] 1 Timothy then chapter one
[45:38] and then let us start reading from verse
[45:41] let me get the verse here.
[45:47] verse 10.
[45:50] Let us start to verse 11.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[45:58] according to the glorious gospel of the
[46:01] blessed God which was committed to my
[46:04] trust.
[46:15] And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who
[46:18] has enabled me for that he counted me
[46:22] faithful putting me into the ministry
[46:36] who was before a Bmer
[46:38] a persecutor and injurous, but I
[46:42] obtained mercy because I did it
[46:45] ignorantly in unbelief.
[47:06] Now when you look at the the background
[47:09] of Apostle Paul,
[47:12] you would think this is a man God will
[47:14] never trust with anything.
[47:18] We killed people,
[47:21] we criticized,
[47:23] we arrested the churches,
[47:26] you know, being a witness at the death
[47:28] of Stevie.
[47:30] And then he says, "I was a blamemer,
[47:36] a persecutor,
[47:38] injurous."
[47:42] You know, he did everything he could to
[47:44] twist the church of Christ.
[47:48] And then he says, "I did all this in
[47:50] ignorance
[47:53] in unbelief,
[47:55] but the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:59] was exceeding abundant
[48:03] with faith
[48:06] and love which is in Christ Jesus.
[48:10] Praise the name of our Lord." So it is
[48:12] the grace of God. The abundant grace of
[48:16] God
[48:17] that he has shown us. It was the
[48:20] abundant grace OF GOD
[48:23] THAT GOD GAVE to Jacob.
[48:26] Not worth really.
[48:30] He was a suppler.
[48:32] That was his name. That was his nature.
[48:37] Even when he was in the womb, he was
[48:40] fighting. when he comes out doing the
[48:43] same thing wherever he was
[48:49] even now that affects even the Jews
[48:54] when you deal with them in business
[48:58] you must know that they are too smart
[49:03] it's a nature
[49:06] until somebody is born again
[49:09] so Jacob
[49:11] That WAS HIS NATURE. BUT THE LOVE OF
[49:14] GOD,
[49:16] THE GRACE OF God came down and then he
[49:20] wrestled with an angel.
[49:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So even
[49:25] Paul,
[49:27] praise the name of our Lord, when he had
[49:29] got authority
[49:31] from the chief priest,
[49:33] where he was going to persecute,
[49:38] the grace of God came down.
[49:40] And a bright shining light came
[49:44] and then called soul soul
[49:48] me Christ revealed himself to Paul
[49:53] and from that time
[49:56] he saw something totally different.
[49:59] And so even the elect lady
[50:03] we were in the denominations.
[50:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So some
[50:10] some of us were maybe alter boys.
[50:15] You know those boys who walk
[50:18] and when they reach their cathedrals
[50:21] they walk as if they are not offensive
[50:22] at all
[50:27] slowly.
[50:30] But what they do outside,
[50:35] there was a story, I think it was in
[50:37] Italy.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And so now after this priest had given
[50:44] communion
[50:50] for just put full doors
[50:56] then started falling on the altar.
[51:01] You know, so some of us were in those
[51:04] kind of places,
[51:06] maybe in the choir,
[51:09] you're there singing in the choir.
[51:12] You're the one who escorts the priest.
[51:15] You did it in ignorance.
[51:18] But then a time came
[51:21] that your eyes were open.
[51:24] So even Paul with that kind of zeal
[51:30] Then he said, "I did it after the Jewish
[51:32] religion
[51:36] ignorantly."
[51:37] But now when Christ revealed himself
[51:42] and then he says, "The abundant grace of
[51:45] the Lord,
[51:48] down to me." And then he says in verse
[51:51] 15, "This is a faithful saying
[51:55] and worth of all acceptation
[51:58] that Christ Jesus came into the world to
[52:01] save sinners of whom I am chief."
[52:17] He said, "I'm the chiefest of the
[52:19] sinners."
[52:21] He was recognizing the grace of God
[52:25] that came to save him. And we also need
[52:27] to recognize the grace of God
[52:30] that I'm whom I am not because of
[52:34] inability,
[52:35] but I am what I am. because of the grace
[52:38] of God.
[52:40] Praise the name of our Lord. How many
[52:42] started out
[52:44] and no longer standing?
[52:47] Who are you? Praise the name of our
[52:49] Lord. Who are you that GOD SO CARED
[52:53] ABOUT YOU that you were born from a
[52:56] believing family?
[52:58] That's a great privilege.
[53:01] It's a great protection
[53:04] that you were born FROM A FAMILY.
[53:07] MAYBE YOUR PARENTS,
[53:09] your father is not a drunker,
[53:12] your mother is not a prostitute.
[53:14] And they give you a good value,
[53:18] a good kind of character to.
[53:21] And then for you, it may also now be
[53:23] opposite.
[53:25] Your mother even can't tell you the
[53:28] father.
[53:30] But the grace of God comes
[53:33] and say, "Lord,
[53:34] I'm here. I've accept the Lord Jesus as
[53:37] my
[53:39] not looking AT YOUR PAST.
[53:42] HE NEVER looked at our backward.
[53:45] But his grace has made us to be the
[53:48] bride of Jesus Christ.
[53:50] Praise the name of our Lord. It is
[53:52] something you look what I say in all my
[53:55] family. I'm the only person who has
[53:58] known this.
[54:00] It's election.
[54:02] It's the grace of God that
[54:05] Praise the name of Then he said, "How
[54:08] abide for this cause I obtained mercy
[54:13] that in me first Christ might show forth
[54:16] all longsuffering for a pattern to them
[54:19] which should hereafter believe on him to
[54:22] life everlasting.
[54:42] Praise the name of our Lord. He said he
[54:44] chose me
[54:46] that he can express himself in my life.
[54:50] And the same thing God has chosen us
[54:54] that can express himself in our lives
[54:58] in your neighborhood
[55:00] at your place of work at your home among
[55:04] a strangers.
[55:05] Praise the name of the Lord. When the
[55:07] people revenge
[55:10] but for you is THE FEAR OF GOD in your
[55:13] life not going to do the way those
[55:15] people do.
[55:17] Praise the name of our Lord. is
[55:19] expressing himself in you.
[55:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[55:24] message, the message of grace,
[55:27] he says that old prophet
[55:30] them eyes narrowed down.
[55:34] He said, David, surely you'll not die.
[55:40] Now we know the story.
[55:44] When the prophet Nathan went to David,
[55:48] when David had committed adultery
[55:52] and even killed and then the prophet
[55:54] told him a story,
[55:57] a parable and David immediately judged
[56:01] that man need to die. Then the prophet
[56:04] is telling him, David, surely you will
[56:07] not die.
[56:09] Watch grace then go to work right quick.
[56:16] The spirit struck the prophet
[56:19] saved David his life.
[56:23] Grace surely you will not die.
[56:26] But the sword will not leave your heart
[56:30] till it thoroughly ped your heart
[56:33] for you are not for you are that rich
[56:36] man.
[56:37] Oh, it was different then,
[56:40] wasn't it? What saved David
[56:44] when his own judgment said
[56:50] that man will die
[56:52] the utmost.
[56:56] He will pay for it with his life.
[56:59] And the prophet said, "Surely grace
[57:03] you will not die.
[57:05] You will not die. David, grace has saved
[57:09] you. It was grace to David
[57:14] that saved him. Praise the name of our
[57:16] Lord. It's always the grace of God. In
[57:20] everything we do, it's always the grace
[57:23] of God. Praise the name of our Lord.
[57:26] Then he said,
[57:28] if it hadn't been for grace,
[57:31] where would we be?
[57:34] Sovereign grace is from a sovereign one.
[57:39] Sovereign grace from a sovereign one.
[57:43] What can it do? Sovereign
[57:48] sovereign grace
[57:50] can do whatever it wants.
[57:54] Listen to this. Now sovereign grace can
[57:58] only be given by one that is sovereign.
[58:04] God is sovereign
[58:07] so he can give sovereign grace.
[58:12] Therefore, being sovereign
[58:15] grace, don't ask anybody.
[58:20] It doesn't do that.
[58:23] It does what it wants.
[58:27] Isn't that wonderful? You don't have to
[58:30] ask can I do this or shall I do this?
[58:34] Can I must I?
[58:38] Or doesn't it? It does itself
[58:43] sovereign.
[58:45] Therefore, he can save the vilest.
[58:50] He can save the worst.
[58:53] He can the impurest.
[59:00] He can save the immoral.
[59:04] He can heal the sick.
[59:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He can save a
[59:11] rich like me.
[59:15] He did. What is it? Grace. William
[59:19] Brham. William a drunkard son.
[59:26] That don't make any difference.
[59:29] The grace of God saved me.
[59:32] Praise the name of each and every one of
[59:35] us. It has been the grace of God.
[59:39] Amazing grace.
[59:41] How sweet is the sound. Praise the name
[59:44] of our save. The rich like me
[59:48] coming down to your levels.
[59:51] Maybe coming down in your gut.
[59:55] you know in those channels
[59:59] drunk and thrown down there
[1:00:02] grace picks you maybe in a prostitute's
[1:00:05] house
[1:00:07] just picks you there
[1:00:09] maybe in a gambling place
[1:00:16] just picks you there
[1:00:18] maybe
[1:00:24] Even they are wicked places.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Wicked places.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; It takes you from that
[1:00:32] where you want to watch team after team
[1:00:34] after team after team all night.
[1:00:40] It saves you from there
[1:00:42] and then says no.
[1:00:45] You've lived a wasted years.
[1:00:48] Wasted years.
[1:00:50] Wasted years. Oh, how foolish.
[1:00:54] Now come and I'll make you somebody.
[1:00:58] Praise the name of our Lord. The grace
[1:01:00] of God coming down
[1:01:02] that can bring transformation.
[1:01:06] Praise the name of our Lord in our
[1:01:08] lives. He said it's only God who can do
[1:01:11] that.
[1:01:13] Me, I'm a woman's daughter.
[1:01:19] That was no good.
[1:01:21] That don't make any difference.
[1:01:24] The grace of God says
[1:01:28] it is sovereign. It has to ask nobody
[1:01:33] nothing. I'm so glad of that.
[1:01:37] Praise the name of can take the vilest
[1:01:40] sinner
[1:01:42] and make him as white as snow.
[1:01:46] You don't have to ask anybody
[1:01:49] about it. Sure.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Like when you read the story of Paul,
[1:01:53] you know there was a prophet called
[1:01:55] Ananas
[1:01:57] and then he was praying and then the
[1:02:00] Lord showed him a vision. Arise Anas,
[1:02:04] go to that city under this in this
[1:02:07] house.
[1:02:08] Get one called Saul.
[1:02:11] You'll find him praying.
[1:02:14] HE SAID, "GOD, GOD, THAT MAN is
[1:02:16] dangerous.
[1:02:19] That one is terrible.
[1:02:21] He started reporting. Oh, you have
[1:02:24] wasted your charge.
[1:02:26] Even Steven,
[1:02:28] one of the deco, he was killed by that
[1:02:31] man.
[1:02:33] And the Lord was looking at.
[1:02:35] You know what he told? He is a chosen
[1:02:38] vessel unto me.
[1:02:41] Praise the name of sovereign grace.
[1:02:46] What did God do? took all what Saul has
[1:02:49] done
[1:02:52] and threw it in the soul forgetting
[1:02:56] the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:02:58] counted soul faithful
[1:03:02] to take what he was fighting
[1:03:06] and take it all over the world.
[1:03:09] Praise the name of God looked at his
[1:03:12] heart
[1:03:14] said, "Let me get this one."
[1:03:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Said, "Let
[1:03:19] me get this." And you see how the Lord
[1:03:22] the grace of God works.
[1:03:25] Paul with his zeal
[1:03:29] with HIS EDUCATION,
[1:03:31] ABILITY TO read and everything,
[1:03:34] God took him and said, "All this is now
[1:03:37] rubbish.
[1:03:39] All this is now dumb.
[1:03:41] This is the way I want to show you.
[1:03:44] Praise the name of the sovereign grace
[1:03:46] of God. So when God told
[1:03:50] it is a chosen vessel
[1:03:53] and Nanas's mind completely changed
[1:03:57] when he came to Saul and he laid his
[1:04:00] hands on him.
[1:04:02] He called him brother Saul.
[1:04:06] Praise the name of sovereign grace of
[1:04:08] God. How we need that grace.
[1:04:12] Praise the name of our Lord to
[1:04:14] continuously work in our life.
[1:04:17] He has chosen us. Praise the name of
[1:04:20] Lord to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:23] And you must believe it for yourself.
[1:04:26] Don't believe
[1:04:29] a foolish virgin.
[1:04:34] I don't know if I will also make it.
[1:04:36] Believe you are that material.
[1:04:41] Praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:46] so you kind of pull away
[1:04:50] be in the middle of it.
[1:04:52] Praise the name of our Lord. IT'S THE
[1:04:55] GRACE OF GOD.
[1:04:57] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:04:59] you must have that love of God.
[1:05:02] Say Lord here I am.
[1:05:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[1:05:07] Bible says in the book of Hebrews
[1:05:08] chapter 4,
[1:05:13] Hebrews chapter 4
[1:05:16] and then verse 14.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Seeing then that we have a great high
[1:05:22] priest that is passed into the heavens,
[1:05:25] Jesus the son of God, let us hold first
[1:05:28] our profession.
[1:05:39] He said, "Behold it fast,
[1:05:42] your confession.
[1:05:44] I am the bride of Jesus.
[1:05:47] I am redeemed. I am saved. You're not
[1:05:51] looking at your abilities. You're not
[1:05:54] looking at your failures.
[1:05:56] You're not looking at your mistakes
[1:05:58] yesterday.
[1:05:59] You're not looking at the challenges
[1:06:00] ahead of you. But you are holding your
[1:06:04] confession.
[1:06:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:06:08] says, "For we have a high priest
[1:06:11] which cannot be touched which which we
[1:06:14] have not a high priest cannot be touched
[1:06:16] by the feeling of our infirmities.
[1:06:23] But was in all points tempted as we are,
[1:06:26] yet without sin.
[1:06:33] SO THE BIBLE IS TELLING US let us come
[1:06:37] boldly
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; not not saying I don't know whether you
[1:06:42] will answer me
[1:06:46] come boldly
[1:06:48] to the throne of grace
[1:06:51] that we may obtain mercy
[1:06:55] and find grace
[1:06:57] in the time of need.
[1:06:59] Praise the name of Lord. So you come
[1:07:01] with boldness
[1:07:04] like Esther.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord was put.
[1:07:08] NOBODY should see the king until the
[1:07:11] king calls him.
[1:07:13] BUT NOW ESTHER CAME BEFORE THE throne
[1:07:16] boldly
[1:07:19] as the bride,
[1:07:21] as the queen
[1:07:23] came boldly.
[1:07:25] The Bible says he obtained favor.
[1:07:30] Even the bride of Jesus Christ have
[1:07:33] obtained favor
[1:07:36] before the Lord.
[1:07:38] So what is your challenge?
[1:07:40] What is your problem?
[1:07:43] What is your need?
[1:07:45] Praise the name of the Lord. MENTION IT
[1:07:47] BEFORE THE LORD.
[1:07:49] LORD, THIS IS my
[1:07:52] need. glor
[1:07:54] come with BOLD GLORY BEFORE THE THRONE
[1:07:57] of grace
[1:07:59] tell God this is myrration today
[1:08:03] like Esther she came AND THEN THE KING
[1:08:07] TOLD HER WHATEVER YOU will need even to
[1:08:11] the half of the KING
[1:08:13] AND THEN THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT WE ARE
[1:08:15] JOINT hairs
[1:08:18] we sit with Christ on the throne
[1:08:21] now if you can share with him with
[1:08:23] throne.
[1:08:26] What about your current need?
[1:08:29] HOW ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT IS TROUBLING
[1:08:31] YOU?
[1:08:33] WHY DON'T YOU BRING IT BEFORE THE LORD?
[1:08:36] LORD, THIS IS MY DESIRE. LORD, this is
[1:08:38] my need and our needs could keep on
[1:08:41] changing.
[1:08:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Our needs
[1:08:47] keep on changing
[1:08:49] like my brother Adonai.
[1:08:52] the need Lord if I can finish these
[1:08:55] functions
[1:08:58] when you go to him
[1:09:01] is prayer he's not praying about school
[1:09:03] fees
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; for what now but there's a time he's
[1:09:08] going to pray for that
[1:09:11] praise the name
[1:09:14] that's what life is needed keep on
[1:09:17] changing
[1:09:19] if I'm renting
[1:09:21] Lord help me to pay. Now the month has
[1:09:24] started.
[1:09:26] Lord help me to pay rent.
[1:09:28] But then I get fed up of paying rent.
[1:09:31] Lord help me to build my house.
[1:09:34] When I build my house, how will I pray
[1:09:36] about rent?
[1:09:42] The needs keep on changing.
[1:09:45] Praise the name of the Lord. SO HE SAID
[1:09:48] WHATEVER need you have
[1:09:52] At any time you just say Lord
[1:09:56] this is my need. Praise the name of
[1:09:59] Lord. For me my need may be something
[1:10:01] different.
[1:10:03] To you it will be foolishness.
[1:10:08] This is my need.
[1:10:11] And then I pray about that.
[1:10:14] And the Lord is faithful
[1:10:16] to answer our needs.
[1:10:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says,
[1:10:20] "Let us come to the throne
[1:10:23] with boldness
[1:10:25] that we may obtain mercy
[1:10:28] to help us in the time of need.
[1:10:31] Praise the name of our Lord." Let us go
[1:10:33] to Psalms 103
[1:10:36] as I try to wind up.
[1:10:39] Psalms 103:8.
[1:10:42] The Bible says, "The Lord is merciful
[1:10:46] and gracious. slow to anger and
[1:10:49] plenteous in mercy.
[1:11:00] Praise the name of the Lord. That's how
[1:11:02] should be in your mind.
[1:11:04] Don't allow the devil to put in you, God
[1:11:08] is too rough.
[1:11:10] God is against me.
[1:11:13] Don't allow negative thoughts in your
[1:11:15] mind.
[1:11:18] He will not always chide, neither will
[1:11:20] he keep his anger forever. Verse
[1:11:26] 10.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Verse n.
[1:11:37] He has not dealt with us after our sins,
[1:11:40] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:11:43] iniquities.
[1:11:52] Praise the name of our Lord. So kind,
[1:11:57] so precious.
[1:12:00] So you come to him with boldness
[1:12:03] knowing that the Lord will sure help me
[1:12:05] out.
[1:12:07] The Lord will deliver me. The Lord will
[1:12:10] set me free from distress.
[1:12:13] The Lord will answer my prayers.
[1:12:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:12:18] to first Peter chapter 2
[1:12:20] and then verse 9.
[1:12:30] The scripture says,
[1:12:37] "But you are a chosen generation, a
[1:12:40] royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[1:12:43] peculiar people, that you should show
[1:12:46] forth the praise of him who has called
[1:12:48] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:12:51] light.
[1:13:20] which in the time past were not a
[1:13:22] people, but are now the people of God,
[1:13:25] which had not obtained mercy, but have
[1:13:28] now obtained mercy.
[1:13:43] Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[1:13:45] strangers and pilgrims obtained from
[1:13:48] fleshy lusts which war against the soul,
[1:14:03] having your conversation honest among
[1:14:05] the Gentiles, that whereas they speak
[1:14:08] against you as evildoers, they may by
[1:14:12] your good works which they shall behold
[1:14:15] glorify God in the day of visitation.
[1:14:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] So the Bible says we are a chosen
[1:14:48] generation,
[1:14:51] a royal priesthood,
[1:14:54] a holy nation,
[1:14:56] a pulia people.
[1:14:59] Praise the name of our Lord. We have
[1:15:01] been chosen by God
[1:15:04] that we should shine as light
[1:15:07] in this dark world
[1:15:10] as the elect lady
[1:15:13] grace. You are required by God
[1:15:18] to show his life,
[1:15:21] to show his praise,
[1:15:23] to show his character,
[1:15:26] the character of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:28] You know, wherever you are, let them
[1:15:31] know there goes a true Christian.
[1:15:35] Praise the name of Allah. Let be a
[1:15:38] testimony in your village.
[1:15:40] Let be a testimony at your school. Let
[1:15:43] be a testimony at your place of God. We
[1:15:46] are looking for a true Christian.
[1:15:48] We have one here.
[1:15:51] Praise the name of our Lord because we
[1:15:53] have been chosen.
[1:15:55] And as God has chosen us, he has given
[1:15:58] us grace.
[1:16:00] And grace means that he gives us the
[1:16:03] abilities.
[1:16:06] He helps us.
[1:16:08] He has given us the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:12] And the Holy Spirit is the comforter.
[1:16:16] What does the comforter do? He aids you.
[1:16:22] You know, he helps you. He enables you
[1:16:26] when you are feeling weak. He comes and
[1:16:29] lifts you up.
[1:16:31] You know he's a help me.
[1:16:35] Praise the name of Allah and is always
[1:16:37] with us to help us in every condition we
[1:16:40] are in to help us in every situation we
[1:16:43] get in.
[1:16:45] The Bible say a very present help
[1:16:50] when you're in trouble. But it doesn't
[1:16:52] STOP AT THAT. ALL THE TIME IS WITH US.
[1:16:56] NOT ONLY IN TROUBLE,
[1:16:58] even in your good time, he's always
[1:17:01] there present.
[1:17:03] Praise the name of So then as God has
[1:17:06] chosen us
[1:17:07] as the elect,
[1:17:10] as the bride of Jesus,
[1:17:12] praise the name of our Lord, reflect the
[1:17:14] image of Jesus.
[1:17:17] Praise the name of our Lord because you
[1:17:19] are the manifestation of the word of
[1:17:21] God.
[1:17:23] Let that be seen.
[1:17:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Let it be
[1:17:28] seen at your place, Lord. Let it be seen
[1:17:31] in your home. Let it be seen in the
[1:17:33] neighborhood.
[1:17:35] Praise the name of our Lord. YOU KNOW,
[1:17:37] OF COURSE, WE know there's going to be a
[1:17:39] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:17:42] Re Romans chapter 8. Many things are
[1:17:46] going to happen at that short time.
[1:17:50] But right now we have the life of Jesus
[1:17:52] Christ.
[1:17:55] Manifest that.
[1:17:57] LET THEM KNOW
[1:17:59] THERE is surely a man. There is surely a
[1:18:02] woman who live by the word of God.
[1:18:07] So you are showing his praise.
[1:18:10] YOU ARE SHOWING his marvelous life.
[1:18:13] You are showing the good works is
[1:18:15] working in your life.
[1:18:17] And all this is happening
[1:18:20] by the ability that God gives.
[1:18:24] Not because you fear the Lord, BUT THE
[1:18:27] LOVE of God.
[1:18:30] Put his word in you.
[1:18:33] What you desire, what you desire is to
[1:18:36] do the will of God. Praise the name of
[1:18:39] our Lord. Lord, I want to do your will.
[1:18:43] I have no other mind
[1:18:46] but your mind.
[1:18:49] Praise the name of Allah. WHILE THE
[1:18:51] OTHER VIRGINS,
[1:18:53] you know, THEY WERE ALL VIRGINS. THEY
[1:18:55] WERE ALL VERY BEAUTIFUL.
[1:18:58] But the king had to choose one.
[1:19:01] Praise the name of our Lord. One. And
[1:19:04] what did he choose? He chose the right
[1:19:07] attitude.
[1:19:11] What is our attitude towards God? What's
[1:19:14] attitude towards the word of God?
[1:19:17] Because that's what God will bless
[1:19:20] you. Bless your motive.
[1:19:22] Bless your attitude.
[1:19:25] When you think about God,
[1:19:29] what comes to your mind? Remember last
[1:19:31] Sunday how the Holy Spirit by the word
[1:19:36] of God divides
[1:19:39] the soul and the spirit
[1:19:43] to make them pure.
[1:19:46] Praise the name of our Lord. How is your
[1:19:48] life?
[1:19:50] How what do you think about Christ?
[1:19:54] When he asked them, what think ye of
[1:19:57] Christ?
[1:19:59] What do you think yourself of Christ?
[1:20:03] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:20:04] just desire Lord.
[1:20:07] He told me, "Let us be like Esther."
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Esther,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; she only obeyed
[1:20:15] whatever the king's chamber line told
[1:20:17] her.
[1:20:19] And we have the king's chamber line.
[1:20:30] You know, you know, you know, a unac
[1:20:34] doesn't have his own seat.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; So what is given
[1:20:46] and that's the messenger,
[1:20:49] the messenger of the age. The messengers
[1:20:52] of the age where the king is
[1:20:55] chamberling.
[1:20:58] So they had to tell the instructions of
[1:21:00] the king.
[1:21:02] And now this chamber line
[1:21:05] had the mind of the king.
[1:21:09] And then he started telling the virgin
[1:21:12] the king like this like this. But then
[1:21:16] there are those virgins who were coming
[1:21:21] for me. I'm going to show him.
[1:21:24] I have to show him the
[1:21:27] day.
[1:21:29] They have to show they have to see the
[1:21:30] way.
[1:21:32] They have to see the the V here.
[1:21:39] That was
[1:21:42] the others came.
[1:21:44] Different virgins.
[1:21:47] Pentecost
[1:21:54] and so that speaking in tong is what we
[1:21:56] preach
[1:21:57] and he's prophesying.
[1:22:00] Another one came
[1:22:05] just put aside.
[1:22:08] [laughter]
[1:22:09] Then another came
[1:22:14] just put aside.
[1:22:17] He was looking for the one with his
[1:22:19] mind.
[1:22:23] Then another one came
[1:22:25] walk.
[1:22:32] The king will not fall for that.
[1:22:36] But there one came
[1:22:38] with his character.
[1:22:41] Praise the name of her and say this is
[1:22:43] the one.
[1:22:45] The Bible says Esther obtained favor

[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; We just now want to start the Lord's
[1:54:52] supper.
[1:54:55] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:54:57] You know in the denominations
[1:55:00] they do it in the morning.
[1:55:04] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; But 5:00 is already supper time.
[1:55:12] It's evening.
[1:55:14] Praise the name of our Lord. He did it
[1:55:16] in the evening.
[1:55:22] So let us stand up and take this
[1:55:24] scripture reading.
[1:55:29] Let us go to
[1:55:32] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; We are reading from verse 23.
[1:55:43] up to verse 29.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that
[1:55:52] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:55:55] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:55:57] he was betrayed took bread.
[1:56:12] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:56:14] it and said, "Take, this is my body
[1:56:18] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:56:21] remembrance of me.
[1:56:33] After the same manner also he took the
[1:56:36] cup when he had sapped, saying, "This
[1:56:39] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:56:42] This do as often as you drink it in
[1:56:45] remembrance of me.
[1:57:00] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:57:03] drink this cup, you do show the Lord
[1:57:05] this death till he come.
[1:57:16] Wherefore soever shall eat this bread
[1:57:19] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:57:21] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:57:24] and the blood of the Lord.
[1:57:37] But let a man examine himself, and so
[1:57:41] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:57:45] that cup.
[1:57:55] For he that eateth and drinkketh
[1:57:57] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth of
[1:57:59] damination to himself, not discerning
[1:58:03] the Lord's body.
[1:58:13] Let us pray.
[1:58:16] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:58:18] Christ,
[1:58:20] We appreciate for this opportunity Lord
[1:58:24] that you have given unto us to come
[1:58:26] again into your presence
[1:58:29] to observe the Lord's supper.
[1:58:33] That Lord, you started [music]
[1:58:36] that night before you were crucified
[1:58:40] and you did it the way did it before
[1:58:42] Abraham.
[1:58:46] Oh Lord, we are grateful [music] that we
[1:58:49] can come before your table
[1:58:52] and remember of the death, burial, and
[1:58:54] resurrection of Jesus Christ. [music]
[1:58:59] And you told us in your word that we
[1:59:02] [music] should do this as often as
[1:59:04] possible.
[1:59:06] And dear Lord, we have come
[1:59:09] not in our own,
[1:59:12] but we are believing the grace of God.
[1:59:16] that has saved every one of us.
[1:59:19] That that [music] same grace
[1:59:22] that released the blood on car
[1:59:26] even release the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:27] [music]
[1:59:29] to wash every one of us
[1:59:32] from all unrighteousness
[1:59:35] from all uncleanness. [music]
[1:59:38] None of us is worthy.
[1:59:41] But Lord, when we're in your blood,
[1:59:44] we are worthy. Lord, [music]
[1:59:46] we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you
[1:59:48] may forgive every one of us
[1:59:51] all our sins and trespasses, [music]
[1:59:54] of anything that is contrary to
[1:59:57] contrary thoughts or imaginations,
[2:00:02] desires, Lord, may the blood of Jesus
[2:00:06] wash every one of us, Lord, and make us
[2:00:09] all heavenly.
[2:00:11] for your mother and your heavenly
[2:00:12] father.
[2:00:14] Now you went about healing the lepers
[2:00:18] which represented sin. And now we have
[2:00:20] the blood of Jesus [music] that shall
[2:00:23] never lose its power till the last one
[2:00:27] is redeemed to sin.
[2:00:29] We pray may bless us father as we
[2:00:32] partake of the Lord this summer. [music]
[2:00:35] Lord, we also pray in the name of Jesus
[2:00:38] that you may sanctify this unleavened
[2:00:40] bread
[2:00:41] that father you will make it worthy
[2:00:45] to serve the occasion of remembering you
[2:00:47] Lord.
[2:00:48] Even [music] as we eat of it, may we get
[2:00:51] the benefits heavenly father and all the
[2:00:54] promises of God.
[2:00:57] As you said, heavenly father by your
[2:01:00] prophet, [music]
[2:01:01] but that Abraham when he ate of this
[2:01:03] unleavened bread,
[2:01:06] he was able to walk the journey [music]
[2:01:08] stronger and healthier
[2:01:11] in our midst. And Lord, as they partake
[2:01:14] [music] of this bread,
[2:01:16] let them be
[2:01:19] And Lord [music] bless every one of us
[2:01:22] that all our hearts desires may be
[2:01:26] even the bottle of wine [music]
[2:01:29] that we shall be taking after the
[2:01:31] breaking of bread.
[2:01:34] Bless the wine fun that may serve the
[2:01:36] purpose of God.
[2:01:39] Oh God, as you called us to do, bless us
[2:01:42] all together as we wait upon you and as
[2:01:46] we meditate upon this [music]
[2:01:49] in the name of Jesus name.
[2:01:52] Amen. You may be seated. [music]
[2:01:54] I would call brother Dan and brother
[2:01:56] Joshua to come
[2:02:16] [music]
[2:02:18] Heat. Heat.
[2:02:28] Heat. Heat.
[2:02:44] [music]
