[25:48] [Music]
[25:58] [Applause]
[26:05] [Music]
[26:10] [Music]
[26:16] let's Save You Tonight
[26:20] [Music]
[26:43] [Music]
[26:59] foreign
[27:05] [Music]
[27:06] [Applause]
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:59] [Music]
[28:02] [Applause]
[28:24] you know brother Joshua
[28:27] is one of those people that are always
[28:31] standing here to lead in worship yes
[28:36] and you know when you're here
[28:43] there is uh
[28:46] a certain few back
[28:50] that you really want to feel from the
[28:52] people
[28:54] you don't speak to statues
[28:58] expect living beings
[29:03] praise the Lord you know they are
[29:06] expected to speak back to you
[29:09] so you know he was telling me Pastor
[29:13] can I say something about that
[29:17] you know it was his uh
[29:20] uh motivation to do that
[29:25] so we give him a few minutes
[29:30] you can come over so we allow him share
[29:35] his uh
[29:37] expressions
[29:41] because
[29:43] he ministers Among Us amen
[29:51] um
[29:52] you know he doesn't want to come here
[29:55] and sing without you yeah and he doesn't
[30:00] want to come here
[30:02] and sing when you are not really knowing
[30:06] what you're singing about yeah you're in
[30:08] buying God
[30:11] so he really feels good when you all
[30:16] join In Worship
[30:17] will you always join in that worship
[30:20] from the beginning of the service
[30:23] to the end of the service it is all a
[30:27] worship service
[30:29] amen amen it's not when the brother
[30:32] comes up here and says oh let us worship
[30:35] together
[30:36] but right from the time you step in here
[30:41] foreign
[30:53] foreign
[31:22] see by the time and this has been
[31:25] the burden of my heart
[31:29] and I pray that it also becomes your
[31:32] body
[31:34] because when we come to church
[31:38] like scripture says it we all bring our
[31:41] league so far
[31:44] so it doesn't start from the preaching
[31:48] of the word
[31:50] you know it when you stand here
[31:53] sometimes
[31:55] you can feel
[31:58] how the people
[32:02] and uh
[32:04] sometimes you feel when you are
[32:06] struggling through a service
[32:10] you're struggling because
[32:14] the prophet teaches us
[32:16] that come early to change
[32:25] why do we come Ali
[32:27] because many times we are rushing to
[32:30] come to church
[32:42] beginning to preach
[32:46] all through the week you haven't even
[32:49] listened to a sermon
[32:51] and these are the things that the
[32:53] prophet teaches us
[32:56] in the Bible say we should meditate
[33:01] yeah so you meditate through the week
[33:05] the pastors have always labor tell us at
[33:08] least pick a someone go and read
[33:13] Because when you come
[33:16] and the song service is starting
[33:20] maybe the Lord has inspired the song
[33:24] leader to go a certain way
[33:42] sometimes you come to church
[33:44] and and we are just seated
[33:47] we are not praying
[33:49] pray for the service
[33:52] pray for the songs that they will bless
[33:54] you
[33:56] and that they will also bless the
[33:59] service
[34:02] that that is the only way you're going
[34:05] to benefit from the gift that is going
[34:07] to come
[34:10] you have meditated through the week
[34:13] foreign
[34:22] [Music]
[34:24] and the prophet says you come expect him
[34:28] and you you get what you expect
[34:32] if you come believing that God is going
[34:35] to heal me in this service
[34:40] yeah people think we don't have the Holy
[34:43] Spirit he's here
[34:45] but which condition do we come in in the
[34:49] church
[34:52] it's it's something that we really need
[34:54] to think about because
[34:58] worshiping is not just close your eyes
[35:00] and you know
[35:02] singing slowly
[35:05] we are playing very nice music
[35:08] it comes from the heart
[35:12] what's the condition of your heart as
[35:14] you come in his presence
[35:17] the fountain is here it's it's here to
[35:20] wash you
[35:22] so when you step here
[35:24] step and wash yourself
[35:27] if there is any guilty staying wash it
[35:30] off
[35:31] so that when the song service starts
[35:37] and you can easily feel it from here
[35:41] where the people
[35:43] well the people pray you don't even ask
[35:45] the people to pray they just begin to
[35:47] pray
[35:49] so the question is what condition do you
[35:52] come in in the church
[35:57] have you come prayed up
[35:59] you come early this is scripture
[36:03] and I'm just encouraging us that we we
[36:06] should do these things because they will
[36:08] really help us a lot
[36:13] amen and then
[36:16] as the as the as the minister comes
[36:22] Nehemiah
[36:29] just flash for me that scripture
[36:34] Nehemiah chapter 8.
[36:41] I'll read it just quickly we'll read it
[36:45] while we are seated
[36:49] it says and Ezra describes stood Upon A
[36:52] palpit of wood which he had made for
[36:55] that purpose
[36:57] okay let me skip down to verse 5 and
[37:00] Ezra opened the book in the sight of all
[37:03] the people
[37:04] is
[37:12] and when he opened it
[37:14] foreign
[37:45] that were actually
[37:47] um always done yeah when you read in the
[37:51] Old Testament
[37:52] every time that the word of God
[37:55] was to be presented
[37:58] in any case if you see the minister
[38:01] coming
[38:03] don't wait to be told
[38:08] because scripture tells us that is how
[38:11] we welcome the wife
[38:13] with gladness we welcome it by standing
[38:17] up
[38:18] and then the minister then comes
[38:22] to take over the service
[38:25] and preach the word so that has prayed
[38:30] so that has been waiting on the Lord
[38:33] so that has been meditating
[38:36] it has been part of the song service
[38:41] those are key things otherwise the
[38:44] minister has a very hard time preaching
[38:48] for the congregation that has not prayed
[38:51] up
[38:52] the congregation that has not read the
[38:55] world
[38:56] so it's my prayer
[38:59] that every time you see the minister is
[39:02] coming
[39:03] like the scripture says the people stand
[39:07] up
[39:08] in respect
[39:10] and to accept to receive the wine no
[39:13] quicker that is going to come to bless
[39:16] yourself
[39:17] this is a tradition in the Bible and I
[39:21] think we should embrace it
[39:57] we come to church empty it's really hard
[40:00] to break through
[40:05] so when we come and we operate up it
[40:09] will always help with the move of the
[40:11] Holy Spirit
[40:12] and you will see people delivered here
[40:15] you see people set free
[40:19] let the pastor do is
[40:26] [Applause]
[40:32] so we appreciate God foreign
[40:39] [Applause]
[41:59] foreign
[42:06] let's stand up and get to
[42:10] Numbers chapter 9.
[42:13] and verse 15.
[42:17] before we read
[42:19] let us just buy heads in our prayers
[42:24] Heavenly Father we come before your
[42:26] presence
[42:29] Lord with humility
[42:33] believing that the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:37] has made our way for us
[42:40] we want to dedicate ourselves to this
[42:43] service
[42:45] believing that you always speak to the
[42:48] election
[42:50] what your heavenly father speak to us
[42:52] this morning
[42:54] but Lord you may get into the depths of
[42:57] the world
[42:59] that Lord we may not starve in the midst
[43:03] of the Plenty
[43:06] that you have given us in the message
[43:11] give grace to the people
[43:14] that the inside teacher
[43:18] [Music]
[43:39] amen amen
[43:42] so Numbers chapter 9.
[43:45] and verse 15.
[43:48] let's see what the holy spirit says here
[43:52] amen amen 9 15
[43:56] and on that day that the Tabernacle was
[44:00] reared up
[44:04] the cloud covered the Tabernacles namely
[44:12] the tent
[44:13] of the testimony
[44:20] in other words is called the tent of the
[44:24] testimony
[44:27] and that even there was upon the
[44:30] Tabernacle
[44:33] as it were the appearance of fire engage
[44:37] foreign
[45:03] and when the cloud came down
[45:06] he did not die down until the morning
[45:12] may God bless the reading of the world
[45:19] so today
[45:21] I want to speak
[45:24] on the 10th of the testimony
[45:28] the tent
[45:30] of the testimony
[45:33] and you know here where do you know God
[45:36] has given us the grace
[45:38] that we present the word in today's
[45:42] gamble in a teaching format
[45:46] so we really need to follow so closely
[45:51] because if you miss me at one Junction
[45:55] I'm sure you'll get me at the second
[45:57] chance
[45:59] you don't need to stay around if you
[46:01] miss something and you are meditating on
[46:04] that and then you're left behind
[46:08] when you come to church there will
[46:12] always be your personal path right
[46:16] certainly when you come pray that
[46:19] your part will always be
[46:22] so this state of the testimonies
[46:29] the 10 of the testimony
[46:32] [Music]
[46:34] was built on a human specification yes
[46:44] so the layout of the temple had three
[46:47] chords
[46:53] there was the first court
[46:56] amen Amina this was the General Assembly
[46:59] place
[47:02] of all the circumcised Israel
[47:06] and then there was another cutter that
[47:09] divided there
[47:12] amen and beyond that was the middle
[47:17] court
[47:18] which was the religious Court where the
[47:22] priests performed their services
[47:26] amen so as one entered the holy
[48:28] there was such a great Bright Lights
[48:33] which was a testimony
[48:36] amen that God was in the camp of Israel
[48:41] so when the tattoo was
[48:45] the glory of God
[48:48] justified by a pillars
[48:57] and then the third was caught
[49:01] the tenth of the testimony
[49:05] he testified of his presence
[49:11] amen amen so when God is in the tents
[49:15] they will always be a testimony
[49:18] and the testimony is not what we say
[49:22] that is the testimony was the glory of
[49:26] God
[49:29] are you together with me and I've told
[49:32] you this stubbornness
[49:34] was built on a human specifications
[49:39] Soul spirit and body amen
[49:42] so this shows that God constructed us on
[49:47] the same premise
[49:50] amen we are under the same structures
[49:55] and that's why the scripture says
[49:58] knowing not that ye are the temp of God
[50:02] and that the spirit of God dwells in you
[50:06] when is the Tabernacle was
[50:10] the glory of God came over
[50:13] and when you become the Tabernacle of
[50:16] God
[50:16] the testimony will be the glory of God
[50:20] over here
[50:22] amen so when Ezekiel saw him
[50:30] himself
[51:39] you're welcome back to the house
[51:43] praise the Lord amen Amina he has got a
[51:47] very good testimony
[51:49] it was very short why won't people and I
[51:52] told Brother James to read it after the
[51:54] servants
[51:56] praise the Lord amen Amina so when
[52:00] exactly you saw him exactly when he was
[52:02] a ghost
[52:05] so when you see the pillars
[52:10] that's the glory that surrounds God amen
[52:15] amen so Ezekiel chapter one and verse 26
[52:20] now Jeremiah is justifying what he saw
[52:25] that
[52:28] question
[52:31] he says and above the family
[52:35] that was over the four living creatures
[52:39] who was the likeness of the throne
[52:43] and the appearance of sapphire stone
[52:47] and upon the likeness of the throne
[52:51] was the likeness as the appearance of a
[52:55] man above a pony question
[53:13] describing God as he saw him
[53:16] so verse
[53:19] [Applause]
[53:24] as the appearance so far around about
[53:28] with it
[53:33] from the appearance of his life
[53:43] foreign
[55:04] foreign foreign
[56:20] this was the appearance
[56:23] the likeness of the glory of the Lord
[56:27] and I said the Lord was engulfed in that
[56:32] fire
[56:35] you see and that's the same fire
[56:38] that came forth in the prayer line
[56:41] when brother Branham was up there
[56:44] foreign
[57:32] amen Amina so and that's the same pillar
[57:36] as I said
[57:37] that went around in the ministry of
[57:40] brother
[57:41] the fire would have come over brother
[57:44] branham's heads
[57:46] as a testimony of the fourth film of the
[57:51] son of man
[57:52] amen amen so when God finds success at
[57:56] the tent of your body
[57:59] but Glory will just come and hover over
[58:04] here
[58:05] you may not understand
[58:08] but the glory of God will normally go
[58:12] around with it yourself traveled with my
[58:15] children
[58:16] sometimes but the people just offer you
[58:20] the respect
[58:21] even when you know they don't know you
[58:25] amen amen the other day was with my wife
[58:29] and we met this man guarding at us
[58:31] foreign
[59:01] that pillow fire goes around with you
[59:04] anyway you may not break into the
[59:07] dimensions
[59:09] that sees the spiritual world to see the
[59:13] pillars
[59:21] praise the Lord amen so we don't seek
[59:25] to produce good works
[59:28] we seek the Bucks
[59:31] that's all you need and everything else
[59:35] will work out by itself
[59:38] but you break your neck
[59:43] that I may turn away from this
[59:47] call for the glory of God
[59:50] that's what you need to calm down God's
[59:54] glory
[59:55] and once that Glory card he is
[59:59] establishing a testimony
[1:00:02] is pleased with you and when that Glory
[1:00:07] doesn't go away until the resurrection
[1:00:18] so when that Glory comes down
[1:01:19] foreign foreign
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:20] Hallelujah
[1:03:20] foreign
[1:03:27] the commitment out of Ezekiel died
[1:03:34] but he says incidentally
[1:03:38] I just find myself fell upon my face
[1:03:43] amen amen and then in that posture
[1:03:46] matriculation of humility the voice of
[1:03:50] God began to speak
[1:03:53] shall we receive the Holy Spirit
[1:03:56] to build a state of humility so that God
[1:04:00] will begin to speak to us if he wants us
[1:04:04] to remove the shoes
[1:04:07] amen not saying I will never do this
[1:04:10] again you will do it in the absence of
[1:04:14] the glory
[1:04:17] you have entered your rest
[1:04:20] God is responsible for everything that
[1:04:24] you do in your life
[1:04:26] praise the Lord

[1:05:48] that pulls upon your children
[1:05:51] amen he teaches us how to stand in his
[1:05:55] presence
[1:05:56] when that Glory came face to face with
[1:05:59] Daniel
[1:06:01] let us go to Daniel chapter 10. and we
[1:06:05] will see what happens
[1:06:12] for the man that were with me
[1:06:18] but a great quirking fell upon them
[1:06:23] so that they fled tried themselves
[1:06:27] you can never run away from the glory of
[1:06:30] God
[1:06:32] are you together you see there are some
[1:06:35] people that will run away from that
[1:06:38] Glory
[1:06:39] especially when God is lifting his
[1:06:42] foreign
[1:06:57] when God is coming down as a teacher
[1:07:02] preparing these people for the rain
[1:07:05] that's going to fall
[1:07:07] there are some people that will call it
[1:07:12] says
[1:07:19] amen they have the voice
[1:07:23] but when that Glory comes down
[1:07:28] to the voice of God
[1:07:32] to the word of God
[1:07:35] amen amen so therefore I was left alone
[1:07:39] amen the glory is only foreign

[1:11:00] Soul could not see nothing
[1:11:03] that's the glory of the Lord
[1:11:06] when he comes down he deems all the
[1:11:09] things of this world
[1:11:11] they become nothing before us before

[1:13:19] ability to do
[1:13:21] I tell you no man can stop what God

[1:21:10] and we may never see the fire literally
[1:21:14] over our tents
[1:21:18] but the fruit of his presence
[1:21:21] will testify of his presence
[1:21:26] this man who stood outside here
[1:21:29] they did not know that in the Hall of
[1:21:32] holies there was the presence of the

[1:22:03] the people
[1:22:08] amen praise God so that you may stand

[1:22:13] maybe the testimony of the pillars
[1:22:21] there can never be a dry almond when he
[1:22:25] steps into that presence
[1:22:27] okay so the entire house
[1:22:31] amen has totally become a Wilderness
[1:22:35] under the body of Christ
[1:22:37] must Institute itself
[1:22:44] to bring up the fruit of the spirit
[1:22:47] because elsewhere it's a desert
[1:22:51] it's a Wilderness
[1:22:55] that are receiving the Reigns of the
[1:22:58] Holy Spirit
[1:23:07] foreign

[1:24:22] children are on drugs
[1:24:30] amen amen you become a perfect influence
[1:24:35] like a John the Baptist Church
[1:24:44] because that's where the spiritual
[1:24:46] awareness is
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:55] for the healing of the nation
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:56] when the soldiers went to him
[1:27:00] he knew that they've got a chronic
[1:27:02] disease
[1:27:23] where the people are going to come to
[1:27:26] you
[1:27:29] Hallelujah
[1:27:32] Jesus
[1:27:41] he says you agree with him

[1:27:53] amen Amina we've got lawyers here you
[1:27:57] know what I'm talking about this is the
[1:27:59] man who man the testimony of conviction
[1:28:06] just agree with him that's their
[1:28:09] character that's their nature
[1:28:13] foreign
[1:29:47] amen which was replaced later
[1:29:51] foreign
[1:30:17] why right so that the prophets of haggai
[1:30:21] makes time
[1:30:23] because he was speaking about a coming
[1:30:26] temples
[1:30:30] he says the glory of this letter house
[1:30:35] shall be greater than the former
[1:30:39] so is the Lord of hosts
[1:30:42] in this place will I give peace
[1:30:46] says the Lord Of Us
[1:30:49] in what place which fortune in this
[1:30:52] greater
[1:31:04] give peace
[1:31:08] all these other temples
[1:31:11] were in them amen but they were scared
[1:31:16] of the enemy I died
[1:31:18] he would come anytime in the time of Eli
[1:31:22] because
[1:31:29] he was always fighting every day to keep
[1:31:33] away the enemies from the kingdom
[1:31:35] welcome back now look at the one of
[1:31:38] Solomon only yes the Babylonians
[1:31:41] are you together
[1:31:44] but then when they did it was also now
[1:31:49] thought to be not perfect
[1:31:54] so they brought the herodian temple
[1:31:57] in 87. promise
[1:32:15] you are in the greater glory
[1:32:21] amen can we give the Lord the under
[1:32:24] pressure
[1:32:27] to say thank you for making me that
[1:32:29] Temple because
[1:32:31] you understand what I mean
[1:32:33] these 10 point prophecy is the Bride of
[1:32:37] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:41] through the seven churches
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:53] so the holy city
[1:33:56] foreign
[1:34:56] what a temple we are making yeah
[1:35:00] you are that Temple not bed with hearts
[1:35:04] that will carry the glory of God
[1:35:07] upon her and that glory
[1:35:11] is
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:15] so this Glory correctly what you know if
[1:35:18] he says it never left you the money
[1:35:22] but then at the end of it in the morning
[1:35:27] of the Resurrection when I mean at the
[1:35:30] end of it amen Amina this Glory here
[1:35:41] foreign
[1:36:04] it's going to be yakuba a permanent
[1:36:08] presence
[1:36:10] and then John says in that City there
[1:36:14] will be no need for the sun because the
[1:36:17] son himself
[1:36:25] where we shall love charity
[1:36:28] to bond us together
[1:36:34] we've been going from glorious Glory
[1:36:38] but soon amen we know it will be right
[1:36:41] in the glory and in his glory we shall
[1:36:45] say
[1:36:46] so this Glory
[1:36:49] comes because through the seven churches
[1:36:54] the fruit has been packing in the very
[1:36:57] Life of Christ
[1:37:01] what's happening there
[1:37:04] praise the Lord
[1:37:06] amen amen so he has been packing us with
[1:37:10] that Glory because
[1:37:11] he packs in the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:37:14] he backs in the body of Jesus Christ he
[1:37:18] packs in that knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:37:21] he packs in the tempers of Jesus Christ
[1:37:25] of Jesus Christ
[1:37:33] and then charity
[1:37:35] comes and dwells
[1:37:38] as the glory over us and when he does
[1:37:43] Look what comes through foreign
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:28] foreign

[1:38:33] they come by that to seek for the sun
[1:38:37] that's wisdom magazine

[1:39:31] has built her house
[1:39:35] amen so he refreshed himself in the
[1:39:38] feminine
[1:39:40] because the spirit of wisdom
[1:39:43] is the spirit of God
[1:39:46] Amen that God who gave his pride
[1:39:50] through the seventh Church
[1:40:00] amen amen she has killed her peace

[1:40:14] at the finishing of this house
[1:40:17] at the seventh Church
[1:40:21] she will be under an ego anointing
[1:40:27] that's why Solomon is
[1:40:29] that she has killed her beasts
[1:40:33] are you together
[1:40:36] praise the Lord

[1:42:36] that we have now
[1:42:42] she has killed her Beast she goes into
[1:42:46] the message
[1:43:07] you can become very proud
[1:43:10] for discovering something which is given
[1:43:14] to you
[1:43:15] not depending on what your place
[1:43:24] amen Amina she's feeding on the depth of
[1:43:28] Revelation
[1:43:31] and she has also means
[1:43:42] foreign
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:37] foreign
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:57] and then gets up there he knows what to
[1:45:00] do he finds the Rock and onion was
[1:45:03] released
[1:45:05] then he comes
[1:45:13] has no respect for a snake
[1:45:18] even if it's a cobra
[1:45:21] you know one time we shall come and show
[1:45:24] the nature of money
[1:45:27] he comes down
[1:45:29] straight putting yeah
[1:45:35] he'll bruise
[1:45:41] and then goes up there with it when it
[1:45:45] goes to the Rock
[1:45:52] are you a ghost this morning
[1:45:54] you must learn to kill your beasts
[1:45:59] amen so Proverbs
[1:46:02] right now listen he says whose soul is
[1:46:07] simple aquarity Italian
[1:46:11] but it's so simple magazine
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] who is so simple
[1:46:21] let him turn
[1:46:23] yourself as for him that wanted
[1:46:28] understanding
[1:46:30] she says to him so
[1:46:36] Solomon is saying here who so is simple
[1:46:42] according to you
[1:46:44] let him come to the unveiling of Christ
[1:46:50] foreign
[1:47:05] in bringing the best

[1:47:15] simplest
[1:47:18] praise the Lord amen he starts on God in
[1:47:24] simplest
[1:47:28] so now we are talking about the latter
[1:47:32] house
[1:47:36] we are that house
[1:47:39] we at the tent of testimony
[1:47:43] and the glory of the Lord
[1:47:49] amen Amina that is the house
[1:47:53] amen so the world currency will see that
[1:47:58] light over you
[1:48:02] saw the light over the Tabernacle
[1:48:05] foreign
[1:48:27] that's what it is
[1:48:29] Matthew chapter five
[1:48:31] and verse 14.
[1:48:34] you are the light
[1:48:37] um
[1:48:47] when the light came over the Tabernacles
[1:48:54] and says look at the god of Israel
[1:48:58] is a bright shining light
[1:49:02] Hallelujah and when Israel went out
[1:49:06] eating Nation upon Nations
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:16] because the gods that were with Israel
[1:49:20] in the wilderness
[1:49:22] has come against us
[1:49:34] Hallelujah just receive that
[1:49:42] and all your fears
[1:49:46] amen amen so the way you remember the
[1:49:50] way the candles were
[1:49:51] leaders because when you are the light
[1:49:56] of the world
[1:49:59] remind you about how these candles will
[1:50:02] lead
[1:50:03] each other
[1:50:08] they picked the fire battle from the
[1:50:12] Holy Father
[1:50:13] and then they lit this candle
[1:50:16] and this kind of after it was
[1:50:29] the seven candles
[1:50:33] when you got your understanding of the
[1:50:37] Southern charges
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] was the light of the next foreign
[1:50:58] that's the fire which we receive
[1:51:02] that's how the candles have been lighted
[1:51:06] that's why I tell you my brothers
[1:51:08] you need to become a bright candle
[1:51:12] but you may become a source of influence
[1:51:16] of the Brethren around here
[1:51:20] you become a tent of witnesses
[1:51:44] praise the Lord tell your brothers
[1:51:54] you are not going to be healed because
[1:51:57] you are the testimony in your place
[1:52:01] because they can't produce
[1:52:05] that's why the criticize not because
[1:52:08] they hate you but because they are
[1:52:10] jealous
[1:52:12] the Nations they knew that God
[1:52:19] the Philistines
[1:52:22] don't care about the future God will
[1:52:26] take care of them you just keep burning
[1:52:31] amen amen so his life
[1:52:34] becomes our life and he's righteousness
[1:52:39] we are here
[1:52:54] and this dedication was not a religious
[1:52:58] ceremony
[1:52:59] but the coming down of the glory of God
[1:53:05] when they went through and they tested
[1:53:07] the ceremonies
[1:53:09] amen Amina you know what happened the
[1:53:12] glory of God came down and shut down the
[1:53:15] preachers
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:21] praise the Lord are you together with me
[1:53:24] when the glory of God comes down in its
[1:53:29] Majesty it is going to shut us down
[1:53:35] God himself will attack his ministers
[1:53:48] why
[1:54:03] have you deceived in the Holy Ghost
[1:54:10] so when it comes to the ministry
[1:54:13] God's law
[1:54:15] foreign
[1:55:02] no no
[1:55:04] let the testimony be seen to be in you
[1:55:11] the fruit of the spirit should be said
[1:55:14] the life of
[1:55:18] Christopher brother
[1:55:23] and the Holy Ghost is a positive token
[1:55:27] but your lamb died
[1:55:30] and you received the token upon yourself
[1:55:34] for his real life is in you
[1:55:38] there's no make believe
[1:55:41] there's no put on
[1:55:44] there's no impersonation
[1:55:51] the world knows that talking is
[1:56:01] a positive died
[1:56:36] and he was carrying his cross
[1:56:40] foreign
[1:57:20] not that the pastor preaches
[1:57:24] but there is a Revelations
[1:57:42] but the lamb that your father knows
[1:57:46] and brings you too cannot release
[1:58:05] foreign
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:59:06] amen amen so then you said brother
[1:59:10] Stephen could do this yes
[1:59:32] so Romans 9 27.
[1:59:36] Isaiah also Christ concerning Israel is
[1:59:44] the number of children of Israel be as
[1:59:48] the son of sea is
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:59] so there is a church natural
[2:00:04] that's Israel Israel and it's a modern
[2:00:07] how God is
[2:00:11] complete his work among the Gentiles
[2:00:16] so Israel is our timetable
[2:00:22] keep looking at them
[2:00:24] and we can know what time it is
[2:00:29] he says in verse 28.
[2:00:32] he will finish the work
[2:00:36] and cut it short in righteousness
[2:00:42] because a short work when the Lord make
[2:00:46] upon the Earth
[2:00:50] is speaking not about Israel
[2:00:54] but the same application
[2:00:57] is used on the Gentile church
[2:01:01] are you together with him God wants to
[2:01:04] do a quick walk upon his brother
[2:01:07] but the question is how does he do it to
[2:01:13] complete
[2:01:15] and release the glory
[2:01:21] you have
[2:01:23] turn around and tell your brother I'm
[2:01:25] the Tabernacle of the Living God
[2:01:31] are you the Tabernacle of the Living God
[2:01:34] rejoicing it is
[2:01:58] foreign
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:46] amen amen
[2:02:49] we apart
[2:02:51] of this quick work
[2:02:55] so what does that bride do okay
[2:02:59] to become
[2:03:04] that brings down the glory
[2:03:07] what must I do the answer is simple
[2:03:12] Mission going down
[2:03:29] which wisdom has built a magazine so you
[2:03:35] cannot enter
[2:03:37] yourself into the holy of holies
[2:03:43] how this happens
[2:03:46] are you together with me
[2:03:48] I told you that the Tabernacles
[2:03:52] is built on the specification of a man
[2:03:58] we are soul on this is
[2:04:06] and then we are Flesh on the outside
[2:04:08] Guru
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] saw you at the temple okay
[2:04:15] now the Bible teaches us
[2:04:19] but it is
[2:04:34] did you hear that oh he did
[2:04:37] so what do I do
[2:04:41] to become a red Tabernacle yeah
[2:04:51] you do nothing
[2:04:56] you just have to be there
[2:05:00] to the high priest
[2:05:03] Christ the high priests
[2:05:10] Wonder yeah
[2:05:12] the temple
[2:05:14] it was just a new house
[2:05:17] we need to go and uh
[2:05:23] that's what the people are teaching on
[2:05:26] the bathroom of the holidays and the
[2:05:28] people bang at their heads on the walls
[2:05:32] they are looking for the holidays
[2:05:36] tattoo
[2:06:25] are you together with me what is it so
[2:06:28] you only need to present yourself
[2:06:37] for the holy priests
[2:06:42] are you together with me what is it just
[2:06:45] submit when there is the service be
[2:06:48] there when there's the church programs
[2:07:08] foreign
[2:08:42] boom boom
[2:08:45] because when they are going to school
[2:08:48] they kick with them you keep seeing them
[2:08:54] they are in the spirit
[2:08:57] they've allowed something go to the
[2:09:00] center Vikings
[2:09:05] another thing is the temple had to be in
[2:09:11] existence
[2:09:27] do you know why you're here
[2:09:30] at least every one of us
[2:09:33] has a testimony that the high priest has
[2:09:37] entered the first court
[2:09:40] that's why you're here
[2:09:43] keep your doors open when he finishes
[2:09:46] work on the outside
[2:09:48] he'll go into the middle course then
[2:09:51] keep patients when he finishes with you
[2:09:54] he enters into the song
[2:10:07] there is no emotions
[2:10:15] the Holy Ghost doesn't come to your
[2:10:17] flesh
[2:10:20] he goes into the holy of holies
[2:10:23] and in there there are no physical
[2:10:26] Sensations
[2:10:36] does not have Sensations
[2:10:42] see when you find people in the church
[2:10:44] they are kicking tables they are doing
[2:10:48] everything because the Holy Ghost is
[2:10:50] coming from Amazon
[2:10:55] if the Holy Ghost baptize the outward um
[2:10:59] it could be possible
[2:11:02] and that's what brother Branham says
[2:11:05] this Holy Spirit on the flesh it's
[2:11:10] possible they will kick around but they
[2:11:13] cannot produce
[2:11:16] and yes I think you are supposed to be
[2:11:19] the tent of testimony
[2:11:24] so he gets in the first Court
[2:11:26] brother Branham says
[2:11:29] everything notice this you know
[2:11:32] justification
[2:11:34] sanctification the bathroom
[2:11:38] let me illustrate it
[2:11:41] I'm down here I'm
[2:11:45] walking this way
[2:11:47] and after a while something speaks to me
[2:11:53] and nothing can turn me but God what is
[2:11:58] meaning Japanese is that I'm going this
[2:12:00] way and God speaks to me
[2:12:05] amen Amina I'm tired this way
[2:12:08] now when I turn around that is my
[2:12:12] justification
[2:12:17] I mean that's what you say how many of
[2:12:19] you have time to yourself you don't
[2:12:22] enjoy night clubs I don't mean you never
[2:12:25] go
[2:12:27] you may have the weakness but that's not
[2:12:31] your desire
[2:12:50] [Music]
[2:13:07] [Applause]
[2:13:11] you are not wasting time
[2:13:16] everything you are now come to the
[2:13:19] person
[2:13:20] of the word
[2:13:23] amen now when you've come down here why
[2:13:27] did I know and the word begins to work
[2:13:29] on your life
[2:13:31] and you begin to throw certain things
[2:13:34] because of the word that's what we call
[2:13:38] sanctification
[2:13:42] foreign
[2:14:24] so each time you come here you are
[2:14:27] coming to yourself
[2:14:31] when you fight the word says you are
[2:14:34] fighting the waters
[2:14:36] I don't need that water because that's
[2:14:39] the only way energy
[2:14:45] God sent John Wesley
[2:14:48] with the message of sanctification
[2:14:51] the cleanliness
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:27] with holiness
[2:15:30] are you together so that's the middle
[2:15:33] court you know you write that that's
[2:15:35] where the candle's way
[2:15:38] that will lead
[2:15:40] and that was a natural life
[2:15:43] but good enough
[2:15:46] to start showing you your debts
[2:15:50] because you are no longer in the world
[2:15:53] you are not in that Perfect Light here
[2:15:57] but you are in that sanctifying life
[2:16:01] it's bright enough
[2:16:04] to show you the better areas
[2:16:20] Lord help me I've not totally committed
[2:16:24] myself to yourself
[2:16:26] amen it is in the middle I got
[2:17:09] who was one of the greatest footballers
[2:17:14] in the history of this country
[2:17:17] his name was the circle
[2:17:19] they used to call him
[2:17:23] he was so strong he could play all the
[2:17:28] games
[2:17:28] in the
[2:17:31] for his
[2:18:05] it never happened again
[2:18:10] so I was justifying to his wife I mean
[2:18:13] to his wife with my wife
[2:18:16] and she said come on
[2:18:20] what you have told him is right
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:19:13] like she should not go to the night club
[2:19:20] foreign
[2:19:31] now one day she said I don't know what
[2:19:34] happened no people came and told me
[2:19:37] these things
[2:19:41] like some angels we're carrying people
[2:19:44] I'm throwing them in very heavy fires
[2:19:48] and then I started screaming because
[2:19:51] they had to come to me
[2:19:53] and then I woke up
[2:19:56] laughs
[2:19:58] see Science Education
[2:20:01] is the work of God himself
[2:20:06] just open up
[2:20:08] allow him to do a work
[2:20:11] in you
[2:20:14] and after the
[2:20:16] you know high priest
[2:20:18] has finishes work in the middle course
[2:20:22] then he has to enter into the holy of
[2:20:27] holies
[2:20:29] listen here this is whether we have our
[2:20:32] message
[2:20:35] foreign
[2:20:46] I want you to know that you are here and
[2:20:50] you already know because the high priest
[2:20:53] entered your first court you were
[2:20:56] Justified and you lost love of the
[2:20:59] things of the world
[2:21:02] you don't just gladly go in there
[2:21:04] anymore
[2:21:06] and now after that you come to a point
[2:21:09] where are your spirits begins to be
[2:21:13] convicted
[2:21:15] when you feel there is something wrong
[2:21:17] in your life
[2:21:19] you apply the washing Waters
[2:21:22] of the world that's your middle card
[2:21:26] then after that the Holy Spirit has to
[2:21:31] enter
[2:21:32] into the holy of holies now if you are a
[2:21:37] Sin Gene of God
[2:21:40] that's where your seed dwells against
[2:21:45] you may have never known that
[2:21:50] because you bypass your fearfulness
[2:21:55] but at this time
[2:22:00] he comes on the inside to make you know
[2:22:04] who you are
[2:22:05] [Applause]
[2:23:05] Divine Fellowship
[2:23:07] anywhere
[2:23:14] it's not coming to church that I'm
[2:23:17] talking about
[2:23:29] with your Genesis
[2:23:33] you begin to see the word difference
[2:23:39] see you are now in Divine fellowship
[2:23:43] and the voice of Fellowship
[2:23:46] is not from the outside
[2:23:50] you are not listening to me from the
[2:23:54] outside if Christ is
[2:23:57] because it becomes an inside teachers
[2:24:13] [Music]
[2:24:23] there is something different
[2:24:28] okay so the whole of holies
[2:24:36] foreign
[2:25:18] are you together
[2:25:21] we all think like a god
[2:25:24] act like Allah
[2:25:28] our concentration is on the presence of
[2:25:32] the glory of God
[2:25:36] Amen Amina brother
[2:25:39] and before they could enter through
[2:25:43] after the Waters of Separation
[2:25:47] let's separated them from their sins
[2:25:50] then they had to go through the public
[2:25:53] testimony
[2:25:55] of Southern Stripes of blood
[2:26:00] showing that death
[2:26:03] went before them
[2:26:08] so we don't stop at these Waters
[2:26:11] we enter the Divine fellas
[2:26:16] brother Branham says it was because that
[2:26:20] today
[2:26:21] material we just stopped at the Waters
[2:26:24] of Separation
[2:26:27] you say you said I no longer
[2:26:32] drinks
[2:26:37] you don't understand the device
[2:26:43] I was born in the church
[2:26:48] I'm not blaming you I'm only telling you
[2:26:52] what you have is not enough
[2:27:01] amen amen so they stopped at the Waters
[2:27:04] of Separation
[2:27:06] don't take them into the
[2:27:10] fellowships
[2:27:14] into Divine fellowship with the Holy
[2:27:22] ghosts
[2:27:25] So Divine Fellowship
[2:27:28] is not your physical presence
[2:27:31] in a Congregation of writers
[2:27:34] it is allowing God to become the high
[2:27:38] priest
[2:27:41] to become The Shepherd of yourself
[2:27:44] when it comes to that you don't need the
[2:27:48] pastor to tell you not to do this The
[2:27:51] Cloud of Glory
[2:27:54] this is a holy Place remove your shoes
[2:28:07] [Applause]
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:25] I know
[2:28:28] foreign
[2:29:03] [Applause]
[2:30:05] is allowing God on thy side
[2:30:11] the door of the Soul um
[2:30:16] [Music]
[2:30:19] foreign
[2:30:38] who enters in Pastor Walter Court
[2:30:41] Angeles
[2:30:43] by justification
[2:30:48] by sanctification and set us in the holy
[2:30:52] of holies for our divine fellas
[2:30:56] that's why he says
[2:31:03] you are at the center yourself
[2:31:12] Korea
[2:31:33] the latches with you technology now
[2:31:37] if there was a latch on the outside
[2:31:42] he would open yeah
[2:31:46] but at the final stage
[2:31:51] you have your Lots
[2:31:56] you have the authority over yourself or
[2:31:58] you know it is always for God you are a
[2:32:01] free will agent
[2:32:04] you can allow women
[2:32:06] you can refuse
[2:32:11] the authorities in your heart
[2:32:17] I started
[2:32:23] and then you tell him leave me alone
[2:32:26] foreign
[2:32:40] yeah yeah
[2:32:44] open the door
[2:32:47] leave me
[2:32:49] foreign
[2:33:19] let me give you this quote
[2:33:23] you know when brother Branham says that
[2:33:26] is
[2:33:27] not actually that is is that is okay no
[2:33:31] you that's the way it is with the church
[2:33:36] God is painting a picture of a beautiful
[2:33:40] holy church
[2:33:43] and before it can ever be taken from the
[2:33:47] Earth
[2:33:48] to the Hall of Fame
[2:33:55] Amen to the Hall of Fame
[2:34:02] in the Palace of God
[2:34:05] it must first pass down the line of the
[2:34:10] critics
[2:34:15] you think you are going to be a darling
[2:34:16] to everybody
[2:34:19] for you to overcome you have to go
[2:34:23] through the critics
[2:34:26] young girls
[2:34:28] say is how you look like
[2:34:33] but before you go into the Hall of Faith
[2:34:36] you must go through critics
[2:34:45] they don't say that because they hate it
[2:34:50] but simply because they cannot develop
[2:34:53] your standards
[2:34:57] amen Amina he says all that live Godly
[2:35:00] in Christ Jesus
[2:35:04] shall suffer prostitution
[2:35:08] yes
[2:35:20] and this artist
[2:35:24] painted the picture
[2:35:26] of Jesus knocking at the door
[2:35:31] when it went through the critics
[2:35:40] there is just one thing
[2:35:42] that I can find wrong on this picture
[2:35:49] you do not have any latch on the door
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:35:55] and when the artist said oh no
[2:35:59] I painted it that way
[2:36:02] he said foreign
[2:36:20] at this point someone you have to open
[2:36:24] the door
[2:36:26] because this doctor here
[2:36:29] is coming to give you
[2:36:31] Eternal healing
[2:36:35] and gracious ministered on the inside
[2:36:39] that's where the Master Seat was
[2:36:46] amen that's where the word is the
[2:36:50] tablets of law
[2:36:54] that's where that Divine bodies
[2:37:00] [Applause]
[2:37:05] that brought back the word of the
[2:37:07] universe
[2:37:20] yo
[2:37:36] foreign
[2:38:04] TV
[2:38:44] so by saying as I'm finished
[2:38:48] Israel believed that God Katonah laid
[2:38:54] behind those Badger's kids
[2:39:02] on the outside and this Glory could be
[2:39:07] seen that you will never till the
[2:39:09] morning
