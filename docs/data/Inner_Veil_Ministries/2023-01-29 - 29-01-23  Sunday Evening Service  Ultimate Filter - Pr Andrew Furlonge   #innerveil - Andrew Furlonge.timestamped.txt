[43:31] and I'd like to entitle it
[43:34] the ultimate filter
[43:39] not just a filter
[43:42] but the ultimate filter is
[43:50] not perfect

[43:55] that is
[43:58] whatever passes through it

[44:09] filter

[44:27] read
[44:30] and the man that is clean
[44:32] Shall Gather up the ashes of the heifer
[44:36] and lay them up without the camp in a
[44:40] clean place
[44:41] and it shall be kept for the
[44:43] congregation of the children of Israel
[44:46] for a water of separation
[44:49] it is a purification for sin
[44:53] no more to um foreign
[45:15] and Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25 and
[45:19] verse 26.
[45:26] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[45:30] also loved the church and give himself
[45:33] for it
[45:34] is
[45:43] that he might present it to himself
[45:46] a glorious Church
[45:49] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[45:54] thing but that it should be holy and
[45:57] without blemish
[45:59] foreign
[46:18] the word is bleeding blood
[46:22] amen that it might wash us
[46:25] and sanctifiers we thank you for the
[46:29] bloody bleeding words
[46:32] that we may be cleansed that we may be
[46:36] holy
[46:37] and that we will be without blemish
[46:41] granted anointing this afternoon
[46:45] that will be edified by your word

[47:03] seated
[47:05] amen Amina I hope I haven't missed any
[47:08] protocol but I just pray that the Lord
[47:11] will bless your hearts this afternoon
[47:15] with this word
[47:17] in the message are thinking a thinking
[47:21] man or thinking man's filter
[47:27] but Abraham says in paragraph 106.
[47:33] the word
[47:49] [Music]
[47:54] it filters all the sin of unbelief out
[48:00] there is no more disbelief
[48:03] when you come through that filter
[48:06] for it is that true believers
[48:13] amen Amina
[49:14] foreign because we can apply
[49:20] amen
[49:22] Amina amen Amina would you want that
[49:25] filter like that
[49:28] because it brings out
[49:31] a righteous man a holy man
[49:40] without unbelief
[49:44] you are
[49:46] cleansed you are Sanctified because you
[49:51] have the right filter
[49:55] amen Amina we we've lived in our time
[49:59] when there was a lot of sickness around
[50:02] waiting
[50:05] and they made us wear a filter
[50:13] mask
[50:17] but sometime it works and sometimes
[50:22] because with the mask
[50:25] some people still get sick
[50:28] doctors
[50:32] so the best man-made filter
[50:35] it doesn't work
[50:38] does not work
[50:40] but God's filter
[50:42] works all the time
[50:45] every time under any circumstance
[50:50] amen I mean I am thankful to die tonight
[50:54] or this evening we have God's filtered
[50:58] amen Amina I guess what brother says
[51:02] I looked at that thing
[51:05] and I thought
[51:11] I thought if a man would think at all
[51:16] he wouldn't smoke
[51:18] how could it be a thinking
[51:23] a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all
[51:30] afternoon

[52:32] is a very intelligent person
[52:36] very accomplished
[52:44] but he smoked as long as I knew him
[52:49] so even though he's academically
[52:52] successful
[52:55] even though he's financially uh
[52:59] financially comfortable
[53:03] today is a dead man
[53:06] amen because he was not thinking
[53:10] if you are thinking you would not do the
[53:13] wrong thing
[53:15] you would stop and think
[53:18] and make the right decision
[53:22] if you don't have their answers
[53:25] there must be someone right now who can
[53:28] give you the right answers
[53:31] amen that is why you have a pastor
[53:35] amen that's why you have a mother or
[53:37] father
[53:38] because they can help you
[53:41] they are your filter
[53:44] that God has given you and when it gets
[53:48] a higher order
[53:49] you can go to God's word
[53:53] amen whatever God's word said let's come
[53:56] to our closet you do it
[53:59] foreign
[54:26] amen why would you want to go to hell
[54:29] amen if you are not thinking
[54:35] the thief on the cross
[54:37] though he was that Thief all his life
[54:41] amen he was that thinking man
[54:44] because when is comrade
[54:49] when is comrade's friend
[54:52] on the uh on the left side
[54:57] will be the Son of God
[55:00] save yourself
[55:06] the friend on the right the thief on the
[55:08] right
[55:10] amen he said we deserve what we're
[55:13] getting yeah come on
[55:16] I've done nothing in his life
[55:18] [Applause]
[55:22] he knew that he's getting judgment
[55:24] because you deserve it that's how he
[55:28] lived all his life
[55:29] but in the final moments of his life
[55:38] Jesus Christ he said when you get into
[55:41] your father's day
[55:44] remember me
[55:46] he made use
[56:26] thank you for remembering me
[56:30] amen I mean when you come in contact
[56:33] with God
[56:34] Amen you use all your faculties
[56:37] and you think
[56:40] amen you think objectively

[58:10] and she went back to our house she took
[58:14] all that she had yeah and even though
[58:16] she was a prostitute she left that bad
[58:20] life she said I must do something for
[58:23] him
[58:23] and I want to say this afternoon
[58:26] that oh Lord Jesus Christ that's done
[58:30] something for my life for me he has done
[58:32] something for you and he deserves the
[58:35] best singer
[58:38] amen amen he deserves the best singer
[58:42] amen he says scarcely for a righteous
[58:45] man
[58:46] when one give their life but someone
[58:49] gave their life
[58:51] but we who are said us
[58:54] we who were Sinners
[58:59] of the economy
[59:02] Gentiles by birth
[59:04] Gentiles by boots
[59:08] yeah God

[59:20] we enjoy the greatest message
[59:35] [Music]
[59:55] [Music]
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:36] under the same conditions at the same
[1:00:40] circumstances
[1:00:49] if he did it once if he didn't want he
[1:00:54] has to do it again because he's the same
[1:00:57] yesterday
[1:01:01] amen amen so we can look at the examples
[1:01:05] and we can come the same way and we are
[1:01:08] thinking man
[1:01:10] we can come the same way and be a
[1:01:13] thinking man
[1:01:15] dollars
[1:01:21] did what she did rehab
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:02:03] an object
[1:02:05] now come to as filtered as a substance
[1:02:11] that is used to separate unwanted
[1:02:15] materials
[1:02:23] but imagine you have slide 10.
[1:02:26] if you pick it up on a slide 10.
[1:02:30] yeah
[1:02:31] when you have water
[1:02:34] it is sometimes impure
[1:02:36] when it's on the surface
[1:02:39] but you want it when you want to make it
[1:02:42] clean
[1:02:43] you filter it
[1:02:45] and you pass it through
[1:02:48] a series of substances
[1:02:52] and when you pass it through gravel
[1:02:55] it will take up the larger substances
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:01] but when you change the filtrate I will
[1:03:04] choose
[1:03:06] it takes out more particles
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:12] and then you will pass it through
[1:03:14] charcoal
[1:03:15] and it will take all the colors
[1:03:21] and when you pass it through a cheese
[1:03:23] clothes
[1:03:25] it comes out almost pure again amen so
[1:03:30] what I feel that
[1:03:32] it takes out
