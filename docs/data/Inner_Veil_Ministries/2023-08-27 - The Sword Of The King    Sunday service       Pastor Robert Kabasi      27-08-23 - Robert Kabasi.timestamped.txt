[31:08] God in the book of Hebrews chapter 4.
[31:16] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 up 13.
[31:24] and then we shall also read Ephesians 6
[31:28] 17.
[31:40] verse 12 says
[31:43] for the word of God
[31:47] for the word of God is quick and
[31:50] Powerful
[31:54] piercing given to the dividing a son of
[31:56] Saul
[31:58] and spirit
[31:59] and of the joints and the marrow and the
[32:02] designer of the thoughts and the intents
[32:05] of the heart
[32:06] is
[32:23] neither is there any creature that is
[32:26] not manifest in his sight but all things
[32:29] are naked and opened up and Through The
[32:32] Eyes of him with whom we have to do
[32:35] foreign
[33:06] which is the word of God
[33:10] foreign
[34:24] right in between there they run the kids
[34:27] what we can share about the sword of the
[34:30] king Eventing
[34:32] Hebrews 4 12 was telling us that the
[34:35] word of God is quick
[34:39] it's powerful Germany and sharper than
[34:42] any two-edged swords
[34:46] meaning the word of God is a sword
[34:50] it's a sword which is sharper than any
[34:52] other sword
[34:55] and then we realize that it appears in
[34:57] through the soul
[35:00] the spirit and of the joints
[35:05] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[35:08] heart
[35:11] the prophet used to teach about the
[35:14] three the three parts of a human being
[35:18] the body the spirit and the Soul now we
[35:23] are being told that the word of God
[35:34] [Music]
[36:21] upon the physical man
[36:24] it will never leave you the same that is
[36:35] amen but that word of God goes deeper
[36:39] and it enters into the mind of a human
[36:42] being
[36:43] so that it changes the minds
[36:46] with our inner persons
[36:49] dealing with the way we think about
[36:51] situations
[36:53] it deals with the reasoning with the
[36:57] affections with the memories with
[37:00] everything that's just in our minds
[37:07] and it goes into the soul and when it
[37:11] reaches the song it gives us eternal
[37:14] life right inside there so it can give
[37:18] us the life on the physical problems can
[37:21] give us the Peace of the Mind
[37:24] handles
