[0:00] Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for your
[0:02] grace and mercy. [music]
[0:05] You've given us to come into your
[0:06] presence, Lord, once again, to have
[0:10] fellowship with the [music] spirit,
[0:11] Lord. Lord Jesus, we've come in one
[0:15] unity, Lord, [music] to have fellowship
[0:17] with the word and to listen to the word
[0:20] as you gathered, Lord, your children
[0:23] that day, Father, in the days of the
[0:25] children of Israel. It is the same
[0:27] today, Lord. You've not forsaken the
[0:30] humanity, Lord. But you are still with
[0:33] the humanity, Lord Jesus. [music] That's
[0:35] why the prophet says that when the
[0:37] spirit came down. He has never gone
[0:39] back. I pray in the name of Jesus,
[0:41] [music] may we walk in the spirit. May
[0:44] we sing in the spirit. May we Lord Jesus
[0:47] love in the spirit. And may we, Lord
[0:50] Jesus, let [music] our deed Lord, our
[0:53] words, Lord Jesus, and our works be the
[0:56] word of God. And let it be done in the
[0:59] spirit of our Lord. Father Lord Jesus
[1:01] come and inspire us Lord as we enter
[1:03] into worship. Lord come and open our
[1:06] lips. So Father as as Lord we open our
[1:10] lips Lord to songs of praises and to the
[1:12] songs of worship Lord. Father may
[1:15] receive your children Lord and Lord
[1:17] Jesus take away the spirit of shyness
[1:20] away from them Lord that they may sing
[1:22] like Miriam Lord when she grow uh
[1:26] grabbed father that trembling Lord and
[1:28] she rejoiced for the deliverance of her
[1:31] Lord. We thank you Jesus. We [music]
[1:33] serve we serve the same God and we are
[1:35] under the same spirit Lord. Father
[1:38] though we have different natures and
[1:40] lives father we know you can break
[1:42] [music] us Lord and we may enter into
[1:45] the worship Lord that we may forget
[1:47] about ourselves Lord [music] we forget
[1:49] about what binds us or what uh kind of
[1:53] [music] pushes us Lord you know the
[1:56] troubles oh father which puts us into
[1:58] worries oh God [music] I pray Lord oh
[2:00] Jesus may you marry them away oh God and
[2:03] Lord may you give us Lord the unity of
[2:06] our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you,
[2:08] Father. We commit the entire service
[2:10] into your hands. [music] In the name of
[2:12] our Lord Jesus Christ, Lord, we pray.

[15:43] Start to be Lord. Dear Lord Jesus
[15:46] Christ, we thank you, Father, for your
[15:47] grace and mercy. Once again, Lord,
[15:50] you've given us to come into your
[15:52] presence. Oh father, precious loving
[15:54] Jesus. Thank you for your loving
[15:56] kindness Lord. And thank you father for
[15:58] this quickening power Lord for that
[16:01] spirit Lord which gives life because
[16:03] Lord as the letter killth Lord but we
[16:06] have both the letter Lord and the spirit
[16:08] Lord. Father Lord Jesus we've not come
[16:11] by the law. We've not walked by the law
[16:13] Lord Jesus but we walk by the spirit. We
[16:16] walk by the ordinances of the Lord. Oh
[16:18] precious Jesus, help us Lord that we may
[16:21] not neglect this gospel. Oh God, that we
[16:24] may not neglect this mercy Lord. Father
[16:26] God, the Bible says you are rich in
[16:29] mercy and you are full of grace and
[16:31] truth, Lord. What you've said, it will
[16:34] never come void. And whatever comes from
[16:36] out of your mouth, Lord, it will have to
[16:39] purpose what the the intent of it, Lord.
[16:42] Precious Jesus, [music] as you called us
[16:44] the bride, as you called us a people out
[16:47] of the denomination, Lord, and the
[16:49] prophet gave us the emphasis, Lord, that
[16:51] this message is not going to unite. Oh,
[16:53] precious Jesus. But Lord, we see it
[16:56] live. We see it, Father, being backed by
[16:58] the signs of the Lord. Precious Jesus,
[17:01] the presence of the spirit of our Lord.
[17:03] Oh Lord God, I commit father Lord Jesus.
[17:06] [music] Whoever has come into this
[17:07] message, Lord, the entire body of Jesus
[17:10] Christ, may you walk with them, Lord.
[17:12] May you stand by them, Lord. And may you
[17:14] lead them, oh God. Father, Lord Jesus,
[17:17] may you never forsake them, Lord God.
[17:20] Neither do you, Father, [music] cast
[17:22] them away. But Lord Jesus, may you
[17:24] cherish them, Lord. As [music] this the
[17:26] prophet said that the Lord waters them
[17:29] that no one can pluck them out of the
[17:31] hands of our Lord. Precious Jesus we are
[17:34] so precious Lord because one so unto the
[17:36] Lord is worth 10,000 words. Oh Lord
[17:40] Jesus, oh precious Jesus, the
[17:42] songwriters say what shall we give in
[17:45] exchange for this opportunity? What
[17:47] shall we give in exchange Lord for
[17:49] eternal life? What shall we give in
[17:51] exchange of a word? And what shall we
[17:54] father Lord Jesus give in exchange of
[17:56] the you know communion of the spirit?
[17:58] Precious Jesus we are persuaded that
[18:01] Lord God neither death nor perils nor
[18:05] distresses no persecutions Lord no heavy
[18:08] trials can separate us from the love of
[18:10] God. Precious Jesus we thank you for
[18:13] that confidence Lord we thank you father
[18:15] for the assurance of mercies oh God
[18:17] which has been poured in our hearts. Oh
[18:20] Lord God, we love you Jesus. [music] We
[18:23] appreciate you, oh God. May you lead us
[18:25] as we walk towards your the coming of
[18:27] our Lord and towards the change of the
[18:29] bodies. Oh father, may we bear the
[18:32] testimony, oh God, like any cloud before
[18:36] we he was [music] translated, he had a
[18:38] testimony that he pleased our Lord. Lord
[18:41] Jesus, may that same history repeat
[18:43] itself, Lord, and to the children of our
[18:46] Lord. And Lord God, we walk that we may
[18:48] walk in the old earths of father the
[18:51] apostles. We thank you Jesus because the
[18:54] same seed which was cast down the ground
[18:56] and it is the same one which has come
[18:58] forth lord. Father may it bring forth
[19:01] its fruit and in abundance. Oh God, we
[19:04] thank you Jesus. [music] We love you and
[19:06] we appreciate you in the mighty name of
[19:08] our Lord Jesus Christ. Lord we pray.
[19:11] Amen.
[19:13] Let's get on our feet.
[19:17] If you are near the neighbor, your
[19:19] friend, shake their hands. Tell them
[19:21] welcome to the house of God.

[19:27] them you're welcome in the house of God.
[19:29] [music]
[19:30] As we start to praise the Lord,
[19:33] shake one another's hands. [music]

[28:32] [music]
[28:36] Amen. Let us pray.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Father, we are thankful unto you this
[28:40] evening.
[28:42] The grace that you've given unto us to
[28:44] come into
[28:47] You said where two or three are gathered
[28:49] in your name,
[28:51] we will be there in their midst.
[28:55] And father, we believe you are here
[28:58] and you also promised that they shall be
[29:01] taught of the Lord
[29:03] and great shall be their peace.
[29:06] We pray you may teach us through your
[29:08] word
[29:09] that you may establish us, Father.
[29:12] that Lord we may not be moved by any
[29:15] form of wind of doctrine
[29:19] or any powers of darkness. Lord,
[29:23] may you grant also to meet all our
[29:25] needs, Father,
[29:27] as we commit ourselves before you
[29:31] upon these meetings, Lord,
[29:35] such as are sick and afflicted,
[29:38] your purpose and will be done
[29:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus. This
[29:45] Amen. Amen. I greet in the name of our
[29:47] Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:50] Let us turn to Luke 5.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; We're reading from verse 17 to verse 20.
[30:04] Luke 5.
[30:07] Verse 17 to verse 20.
[30:12] The Bible says, "And it came to pass on
[30:15] a certain day as he was teaching that
[30:18] there were Pharisees and doctors of law
[30:22] sitting by which were come out of every
[30:25] town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem.
[30:30] And the power of the Lord was present to
[30:32] heal them.
[30:37] Fore!
[30:45] Foreign! Foreign!
[30:59] And behold, men brought in a a bed, a
[31:04] man with which was taken with pulsy, and
[31:08] they sought means to bring him in, and
[31:11] to lay him before him. [clears throat]
[31:25] And when they had they could not find by
[31:28] what way they might bring him in because
[31:31] of the multitude, they went upon the
[31:35] housetop and let him down through the
[31:38] tiling with his coach into the midst
[31:41] before Jesus.
[32:00] And when he saw their faith, he said
[32:03] unto him, "Man, thy sins are forgiven
[32:07] thee.
[32:15] May God bless of his word. You may be
[32:18] seated.
[32:20] I want to preach on the subject.
[32:24] Thy sins are forgiven.
[32:27] Praise the name of our Lord.
[32:31] Now when we go in the scriptures,
[32:35] the Bible says that we were born in sin
[32:40] and then we are shaped in iniquity.
[32:46] Our first birth
[32:48] makes us sinners by nature.
[32:53] You know people were born in sin,
[32:56] shaped in iniquity.
[32:58] The natural man
[33:00] is actually you know rebellious by
[33:03] nature.
[33:05] You know that's the nature that we taken
[33:07] in our first birth.
[33:11] We are easily influenced by wrong things
[33:16] and even the the environment that we
[33:18] live in
[33:21] there are domains of Satan
[33:24] because right now Satan is the prince of
[33:28] the world's
[33:30] one who rules the world.
[33:34] You know he has agents he uses to rule
[33:37] the world.
[33:40] He has systems he has already
[33:41] established.
[33:43] So now when we are born into this earth
[33:47] you know we come by sinners by nature.
[33:56] We are born sinners by nature.
[34:02] Now then the systems that surround us
[34:08] everything is just bent on doing what
[34:11] the devil wants to be done
[34:16] like when you look at the systems
[34:19] you know they said don't do this but
[34:22] they themselves do the same thing
[34:26] you know then they like now we can look
[34:28] what the law enforcers
[34:37] You get them breaking the same laws they
[34:40] saying that they telling people to keep
[34:44] because it is a nature.
[34:47] It's just a nature for them. He says
[34:48] this is my work.
[34:51] But then when you follow you find he's
[34:52] doing the same thing.
[34:56] Now, so we were born in sin
[35:00] and then we were shaped in iniquity
[35:05] but you know God rich in mercy.
[35:09] Praise the name of our Lord. He reached
[35:11] down
[35:13] to see that we are delivered from our
[35:16] sin.
[35:19] Praise the name of our Lord in the
[35:21] message. God hiding himself in
[35:22] simplicity.
[35:29] Now when man before he sinned,
[35:34] when man sinned,
[35:36] he separated himself from God
[35:41] and he crossed a great chasm
[35:45] and put himself in death on this side.
[35:50] You know when you read in Genesis
[35:52] chapter one,
[35:54] the Bible says that everything that God
[35:57] created
[36:00] was very good.
[36:02] And now sin comes in Genesis chapter 3.
[36:07] But then in Genesis chapter 2,
[36:12] God tells the man not to eat of the
[36:14] fruit.
[36:17] And then he says, you know, that day you
[36:20] eat of the fruit, you will die.
[36:25] So now man, that's Eve and Adam,
[36:31] &gt;&gt; they left obedience to the word of God
[36:35] and then they were able to take what the
[36:37] serpent was telling them.
[36:40] And that's how sin came in.
[36:43] And now when sin came in, it separated
[36:47] man from God.
[36:51] And that's what always sins does.
[36:54] Sin will always separate you from God.
[36:59] You'll not have a f continuous
[37:01] fellowship.
[37:04] You'll find that when you are you have
[37:06] sinned,
[37:08] you don't want to meet God.
[37:11] You don't have strength to pray to God.
[37:14] You don't want to wait on the Lord.
[37:18] Your heart condemns you.
[37:20] You feel something which is not right.
[37:24] Like there are some people when they get
[37:27] themselves into something which is not
[37:29] right.
[37:32] They stop coming to church.
[37:35] They stop coming to church.
[37:37] You know they no longer come to church.
[37:41] You know they no longer read their
[37:43] Bibles.
[37:45] You see how they can avoid a brother or
[37:48] a sister when you meet them on the road.
[37:53] You see their lives actually they are no
[37:56] longer in the spirit of God.
[38:01] That's what sin does is it separates you
[38:04] from God.
[38:08] Like the same thing when God could come
[38:10] in the cool of the day
[38:14] to have fellowship with Adam and Eve.
[38:18] So when God reached a place of
[38:20] communion,
[38:24] Adam was not there.
[38:26] Eve was not there. Then he said, "Adam,
[38:29] Adam, where are you?"
[38:32] And then Adam
[38:34] &gt;&gt; said we are afraid
[38:38] you know. So but Adam started confessing
[38:42] his situation.
[38:46] We are afraid because we are naked.
[38:51] And then he asked him who told you that
[38:53] you are naked?
[38:55] Did you eat of the tree that I told you
[38:57] not to eat?
[38:59] Then he said the woman, you know,
[39:01] excuses all the time.
[39:04] The woman has told me to do this. Then
[39:06] the woman, the serpent has caused me to
[39:08] do this.
[39:10] Excuses all the time. But you see, if we
[39:13] are coming to God
[39:16] and we desire the forgiveness of our
[39:18] sins,
[39:21] we shouldn't put our blame on somebody
[39:23] else.
[39:27] sin.
[39:28] Own your sin.
[39:31] You know, you say, "Lord, it's me who is
[39:33] wrong."
[39:36] And this is what David said.
[39:39] He said, "I acknowledge my
[39:41] transgressions.
[39:44] You know, I I accept it.
[39:50] Praise the name of our Lord. I confess
[39:52] that I'm the one who has done wrong.
[39:56] I'm not saying it is somebody else who
[39:57] has caused me to do this.
[40:00] But that's the desire of God
[40:04] that each of us can acknowledge our
[40:06] mistakes.
[40:09] You say, "I am the person who has done
[40:11] wrong.
[40:13] I have failed in this kind of matter.
[40:16] I've not walked right before you, Lord.
[40:20] Praise the name of the Lord." So he
[40:23] says,
[40:26] There was no way for him to get back.
[40:30] And then when he did,
[40:32] God accepted a substitute
[40:38] which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep
[40:44] &gt;&gt; or something for blood
[40:49] on that side
[40:52] is a son of God, is an offspring from
[40:56] God,
[40:58] is an inheritance of the earth.
[41:02] He can control nature.
[41:05] He can speak it into existence.
[41:08] Why? He's a creator himself.
[41:11] He's an offspring of God.
[41:14] Now, that was before the fall.
[41:19] Dominion over all the earth.
[41:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Genesis 1
[41:25] verse 26.
[41:28] He had dominion,
[41:31] you know, but then when he sinned,
[41:34] he lost that dominion.
[41:36] So man rules the earth by dread,
[41:41] you know, just kind of, you know, scares
[41:44] things.
[41:46] Before they fall, he all the animals to
[41:49] come
[41:50] and he named all the animals.
[41:53] But now when the fall comes,
[41:56] They have to deise means of controlling
[41:59] animals.
[42:02] When they have maybe animals like lions,
[42:06] they have to put them in a cage.
[42:09] If they want to touch a lion,
[42:11] they have to shoot it with a gun, maybe
[42:13] with seductive medicine.
[42:18] You know, they just kind of like shoot
[42:25] some medicine in it
[42:27] to make it drowsy or like sleep
[42:36] and then they can touch it. But in it
[42:40] senses they can't do such a thing.
[42:43] Now that means that the son of God has
[42:46] lost his dominion.
[42:51] But now when God restore us back to our
[42:53] right positions,
[42:57] we shall go back to what it was like in
[42:59] the beginning.
[43:02] Praise the name of our Lord. And it's
[43:04] the new birth
[43:06] that restores us back to what it was in
[43:08] the beginning.
[43:12] Praise the name of our Lord.
[43:13] Like brother Brham when he was crossing
[43:16] a certain farm
[43:19] and then there was a mad cow coming.
[43:23] Then the divine love of God came in his
[43:26] heart
[43:28] and then he was able to temp the mad
[43:30] cow.
[43:33] You know he was getting into a condition
[43:35] of before the fall was.
[43:40] And then the Bible tells us that during
[43:43] the millennial reign of Jesus Christ
[43:47] will be peace all over the earth.
[43:51] Praise the name of Lord. But as we are
[43:53] living under these conditions
[43:56] where there is a lot of pollution,
[44:00] there is a lot of wickedness.
[44:03] There is destruction that always comes
[44:05] forth.
[44:08] Praise the name of Lord.
[44:10] Then in paragraph 407
[44:14] but when he crossed
[44:17] he separated his sunship.
[44:22] He is a sinner by nature
[44:26] is under the hands and dominion of
[44:28] Satan.
[44:32] And God took a sacrifice
[44:36] a chemical of the blood
[44:40] But the blood of bulls and goats
[44:45] did not divorce sin.
[44:48] It only covered sin.
[44:52] Praise the name of Lord. So in the Old
[44:54] Testament, they were using the blood of
[44:56] animals
[44:58] and the blood of animals would just only
[45:01] cover the sin.
[45:04] But now in the New Testament,
[45:06] our Lord Jesus Christ
[45:09] sheds his own blood.
[45:12] And now the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:16] remits sin.
[45:19] Praise the name of our Lord. Removes our
[45:22] sin.
[45:24] Praise the name of our Lord. When Jesus
[45:27] was preaching in Israel
[45:30] and then they heard of the great things
[45:32] that the Lord was doing.
[45:36] So they brought this man through a roof.
[45:40] And now when they dropped him in the
[45:42] midst of Jesus Christ,
[45:45] he told this man, your sins are
[45:48] forgiven.
[45:50] Now you should also know
[45:52] that sickness,
[45:55] death,
[45:56] suffering,
[45:58] many of these things which are not
[46:00] pleasant
[46:02] as a result of sin.
[46:08] Praise the name of Lord. If the sin was
[46:10] not there,
[46:12] there wouldn't be death.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be suffering.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be sickness
[46:19] because all these things
[46:21] come as a result of sin.
[46:25] There wouldn't be famine.
[46:28] There would not be like poverty.
[46:31] But all these things come as a result of
[46:34] sin.
[46:37] Because the earth was cast because of
[46:39] sin
[46:41] that you can even labor
[46:45] and then you are not getting anything
[46:46] out of it.
[46:49] So now when he told this man
[46:52] your sins are forgiven
[46:55] then the secrets and the pes were
[46:56] wondering who is this who forgives sin.
[47:01] Praise the name of our Lord. And so many
[47:04] people
[47:06] cannot believe that their sins are
[47:08] forgiven
[47:12] or they cannot accept the sacrifice
[47:16] that our Lord Jesus Christ did for us.
[47:21] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[47:23] need to believe the word of God
[47:26] that when you confess your sins
[47:29] in the name of the Lord,
[47:32] they are forgiven.
[47:34] Praise the name of. You need to have
[47:36] that faith and believe that if I can
[47:40] confess my sins before the Lord,
[47:44] the Lord will forgive me of my mistakes.
[47:48] The Lord will forgive me of my
[47:49] trespasses.
[47:52] forgive me of my failures.
[47:55] Praise the name of the Lord. Do not
[47:57] allow Satan,
[47:59] you know, to put it in your mind that
[48:02] you can never be forgiven
[48:06] because that's the gospel of Satan.
[48:09] There's no more forgiveness.
[48:11] But right now,
[48:14] the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:16] still forgives us of all our sins.
[48:20] Praise the name of our Lord. The blood
[48:23] of Jesus Christ
[48:25] on the altar.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord whereby our
[48:30] prayers
[48:32] in the message the fifth seal.
[48:36] It says notice this. Now,
[48:40] now if there is no altar of sacrifice in
[48:43] heaven,
[48:49] where is the sacrifice for sin laying?
[48:52] Then,
[48:56] the lamb.
[48:59] There has to be a place where the slain
[49:01] lamb
[49:05] blood
[49:07] is laying there
[49:10] where the blood is.
[49:13] Now the incense
[49:16] and the order staff that they burnt
[49:22] which the Bible said was the prayers of
[49:24] the saints.
[49:28] If there was no sacrifice on the altar,
[49:33] then the prayers cannot be received.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It's only by the blood on the
[49:39] sacrificial altar
[49:45] that let the prayers go through to God.
[49:51] Praise the name of our Lord. He answers
[49:53] us because there is blood on the altar.
[49:59] Praise the name of our Lord. The masses
[50:01] seat
[50:04] has blood. But time is going to reach
[50:08] where the masses seat
[50:11] will become the judgment seat
[50:14] and that's the time when the rapture
[50:16] takes place.
[50:19] There will be no more salvation of
[50:22] Gentiles
[50:25] because the Bible says he that is filthy
[50:27] let him be filthy still.
[50:31] He that is righteous let him be
[50:32] righteous still.
[50:34] But right now, as long as the rapture
[50:37] has not taken place,
[50:40] the blood of Jesus Christ,
[50:44] praise the name of our Lord, still
[50:46] covers the earth
[50:48] like that vision brother Brham saw,
[50:52] you know, when he saw the blood of Jesus
[50:54] Christ up upon the earth
[50:58] that every sin just gets into that blood
[51:03] to hold the wrath of God from coming
[51:05] down
[51:08] because there are people God wants to
[51:10] redeem.
[51:13] Praise the name of Lord. He desires us
[51:16] to reach his perfection.
[51:19] He desires us to be like our Lord Jesus
[51:21] Christ.
[51:23] So the blood is still on the altar
[51:26] to bring us into the image of Jesus
[51:28] Christ.
[51:31] Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:33] Let us go back that message. The bleach
[51:39] he says,
[51:40] &gt;&gt; "I've got a red spot on my hand and
[51:44] cover it with white." If I have got a
[51:47] red spot
[51:53] and then cover it
[51:59] with white.
[52:01] The red spot is still there.
[52:07] It is still there.
[52:10] But God sent down from heaven
[52:15] a bleach for sin.
[52:19] It was the blood of his own son
[52:23] that when our confessed sin drops into
[52:26] God's bleach,
[52:31] try to find it again.
[52:35] The coloring of sin
[52:38] goes back through the mediators and
[52:41] through the time
[52:46] until it hits the accuser Satan
[52:54] it on him until the day of judgment.
[53:00] So there is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:03] So now what we are required to do
[53:07] &gt;&gt; is confess your sin
[53:11] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; And so the sin that you have confessed,
[53:18] that blood of Jesus Christ
[53:21] is a bleach,
[53:25] you know, it removes it.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Like now we have for example bleaching
[53:31] agents
[53:34] For example, like jig.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; So when you put jig on a white cloth
[53:39] which has got a spot, a black spot,
[53:47] that black spot is dissolved.
[53:52] So even the the the blood of Jesus
[53:54] Christ
[53:56] when you drop sin in the blood of Jesus
[53:58] Christ
[54:01] that blood takes away the elements of
[54:03] sin
[54:06] and then gets it back to Satan.
[54:10] Praise the name of Lord. You are not
[54:12] counted for that sin.
[54:15] But that sin is counted on Satan
[54:19] because he's the one who caused you to
[54:20] do that sin.
[54:22] Praise the name of Lord. That's how the
[54:24] blood of Jesus Christ works.
[54:28] So then you need to confess your sin.
[54:32] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[54:34] tell God, Lord, this is why I'm failing.
[54:38] Praise the name of God. And then Christ
[54:42] takes it back on the account of Satan.
[54:47] And when confessing is confessed,
[54:52] and been dipped into
[54:55] a man or woman that has been dipped into
[54:57] the blood of Jesus Christ,
[55:02] it kills all symptoms
[55:07] and every molecule of sin
[55:12] goes back to the devil
[55:15] and laid on him till the day of
[55:17] judgment.
[55:21] where his eternal destination will be
[55:24] thrown into the lake of fire
[55:29] and the chasm is breached
[55:33] and never to come into remembrance
[55:35] anymore
[55:38] and a man stands justified
[55:43] as a son of God.
[55:46] Praise the name of God. That's what the
[55:48] blood of Jesus Christ does. It
[55:51] reconciles us back to the father.
[55:55] It puts us back into fellowship.
[55:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[56:01] shouldn't allow sin to hold you back
[56:06] because our sins
[56:08] are forgiven.
[56:10] Praise the name of the Lord. You just
[56:12] have to accept the sacrifice.
[56:16] You just have to accept the propitation
[56:18] for our sin.
[56:21] Praise the name of Lord. Now you know
[56:23] the devil is so cunning.
[56:27] He can make you doubt
[56:30] your forgiveness of sins.
[56:36] Now in 1 John chapter 2
[56:40] and then verse one he says, "My little
[56:44] children,
[56:47] these things write I unto you that you
[56:49] sin not.
[57:02] Praise the name of our Lord." Now the
[57:04] Bible says
[57:06] I write unto you
[57:09] that you sin not.
[57:13] But that's not the end of the scripture.
[57:17] So he says, "I don't support you to sin.
[57:22] Don't sin.
[57:24] Don't go away from God.
[57:27] Don't unbelieve God.
[57:30] Don't do things contrary to God."
[57:33] And then he says,
[57:35] And if any man sin,
[57:40] that's not the end of that man.
[57:44] He says we have an advocate
[57:50] with the father,
[57:52] Jesus Christ the righteous.
[57:55] So he says, don't sin,
[57:58] but then if you sin,
[58:01] we have an advocate.
[58:04] In other words, we have the blood of
[58:06] Jesus Christ that is ready to remove our
[58:10] sins.
[58:13] Praise the name of our Lord. And he is
[58:15] the propetition for our sins
[58:19] and not ours only,
[58:23] but also the sins of the whole world.
[58:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[58:30] the blood of Jesus Christ and by the
[58:33] blood of Jesus Christ
[58:35] our sins are all forgiven.
[58:39] So what is my responsibility?
[58:42] Take your sin in the blood of Jesus
[58:44] Christ.
[58:46] Confess your sin before God.
[58:50] You know, just like the prodigal son,
[58:54] he left his father.
[58:57] And then now when he was in a far
[58:58] country
[59:00] and he came to his realization,
[59:04] he came to understand his condition.
[59:09] He accepted his mistake.
[59:12] The things he was going through
[59:15] made him realize
[59:18] that he's in a terrible condition.
[59:21] Then he remembered his father.
[59:24] So what did he do? He he he determined
[59:29] and said let me go back to my father.
[59:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[59:35] to Luke chapter 15 and verse 17.
[59:42] The Bible says
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 17 verse 7 Luke 15:1 17
[59:51] and when he came to himself he said how
[59:54] many hired servants of my father have
[59:57] bread enough and to spare and I perish
[1:00:01] with hunger.
[1:00:15] Praise the name of our Lord. He left his
[1:00:18] father.
[1:00:20] He left the influence of his father.
[1:00:24] He deserted the support of his father.
[1:00:28] So he went into a far country and he
[1:00:31] wasted his life.
[1:00:34] And the devil is always cunning.
[1:00:38] He can make somebody do something wrong.
[1:00:43] And then that somebody
[1:00:45] says, "Ah, let me leave Ginger."
[1:00:49] And then he goes to a place where nobody
[1:00:51] knows where he's going.
[1:00:54] And then he says, "Now I'm free. I can
[1:00:55] do whatever I want to.
[1:00:58] I can go into gambling.
[1:01:01] I can go maybe marry another wife.
[1:01:05] I can start something different.
[1:01:08] Nobody knows me here.
[1:01:11] But always a child of God.
[1:01:14] God will reach that place
[1:01:18] like he visited that country with famine
[1:01:23] and everything got over.
[1:01:27] So you can get somebody's living in that
[1:01:29] far country.
[1:01:32] sickness comes,
[1:01:34] poverty comes
[1:01:37] and all those people who are around him
[1:01:39] just say this man is cast.
[1:01:43] Yeah, let me go back to my parents.
[1:01:47] So and so came back but he's not doing
[1:01:49] well,
[1:01:54] you know. So that's what that happening
[1:01:56] to this prodigal son.
[1:01:59] By the time he came back,
[1:02:03] he's he was dressed in rugs.
[1:02:07] He was just completely disorganized
[1:02:09] life.
[1:02:12] But he said, "Let me go back to my
[1:02:14] father."
[1:02:17] So he said, the Bible said he came to
[1:02:20] himself
[1:02:23] and the Holy Spirit will always bring
[1:02:26] conviction in our heart
[1:02:29] when we do something wrong before God
[1:02:31] and then you say, "Where has my peace
[1:02:33] gone?
[1:02:36] Where has my joy gone?"
[1:02:39] You find something that's not right in
[1:02:41] your life
[1:02:43] and you try to track back what have I
[1:02:45] done which is wrong.
[1:02:47] What have I said which is wrong? What
[1:02:50] have I thought which is wrong?
[1:02:52] You are trying to get back
[1:02:55] that you can restore the joy of your
[1:02:58] salvation.
[1:03:02] So he said, "I will arise
[1:03:05] and I will go to my father
[1:03:08] and I will say unto my father,
[1:03:11] I have sinned against heaven
[1:03:15] and before thee." He understood his
[1:03:18] condition.
[1:03:20] So even
[1:03:22] praise the name of our we need to
[1:03:24] acknowledge.
[1:03:26] You know, you you come to realization
[1:03:30] and then you admit
[1:03:33] this is my mistake.
[1:03:36] This is my wrong.
[1:03:38] And then you fully turn back to God.
[1:03:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:03:45] Bible says when he went
[1:03:48] his father received him.
[1:03:51] Praise the name of Lord. Let us go to
[1:03:53] Psalms 51.
[1:03:59] Psalms 51
[1:04:05] and then we start reading from verse
[1:04:07] four.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Let us start from verse three.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:04:18] verse two, wash me.
[1:04:22] Okay, let's start from verse one. He
[1:04:24] says, "Have mercy upon me, oh God,
[1:04:27] according to thy loving kindness,
[1:04:29] according to the multitude of thy tender
[1:04:31] mercies, blot out my transgressions.
[1:04:46] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:04:48] Psalms 51
[1:04:50] teaches you how to repent.
[1:04:54] Praise the name of our Lord. How can you
[1:04:56] get reconciled back to God?
[1:04:59] You've been doing something wrong.
[1:05:02] There's something troubling you in your
[1:05:04] life.
[1:05:06] And so, David had committed adultery
[1:05:10] and he had also killed. It took a whole
[1:05:13] year
[1:05:16] and you know there are people who can
[1:05:17] live in sin
[1:05:20] for a period of time
[1:05:23] and is as if nothing has happened.
[1:05:28] Praise the name of our Lord and then God
[1:05:30] sends prophet Nathan
[1:05:34] to tell David
[1:05:37] there is this thing you have done which
[1:05:39] is wrong.
[1:05:42] And so David,
[1:05:45] never argued about his sin.
[1:05:50] David admitted his sin
[1:05:53] and said, "Lord have mercy upon me."
[1:05:56] Then the prophet told him, "God has
[1:06:00] forgiven you your sin."
[1:06:03] Now in the self-righteousness of David
[1:06:08] when he was told about a certain man
[1:06:13] in a parable
[1:06:15] he said that man should die
[1:06:18] but now the mercies of God came down
[1:06:22] David repented
[1:06:24] and God told David
[1:06:26] you are not going to die praise the name
[1:06:29] of our Lord and that's what the Bible
[1:06:31] says he has not judged us according to
[1:06:35] our sins
[1:06:38] because God is longsuffering.
[1:06:43] God has a lot of mercy for us.
[1:06:47] Now there are people who are always
[1:06:49] judgmental about others.
[1:06:53] Anything small, they want to pass
[1:06:55] judgment.
[1:06:57] Even for themselves, they want to pass
[1:06:59] judgment.
[1:07:02] And you know they say now this one I
[1:07:04] cannot go back.
[1:07:06] This one I cannot be accepted.
[1:07:09] This one I cannot be forgiven.
[1:07:11] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[1:07:14] take tonight
[1:07:16] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:19] Reit all our sins.
[1:07:21] It doesn't matter what you have done.
[1:07:25] Praise the name of our Lord. The blood
[1:07:27] of Jesus Christ is here to have all our
[1:07:30] sins forgiven.
[1:07:33] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[1:07:36] don't go and then just completely give
[1:07:38] up.
[1:07:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Here David
[1:07:43] said, "Lord, have mercy upon me.
[1:07:48] According to your loving kindness,
[1:07:51] according to the multitude of your
[1:07:53] tender mercies,
[1:07:56] blot out my transgressions."
[1:08:00] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:08:02] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
[1:08:07] and cleanse me from my sin.
[1:08:11] For I acknowledge my transgressions,
[1:08:16] and my sin is ever before me
[1:08:21] against you.
[1:08:23] And you only have I sinned
[1:08:27] and done this evil in your sight,
[1:08:31] that you may be justified when you
[1:08:33] speak,
[1:08:35] and be clear when you judge.
[1:08:39] Behold, I was shaped in iniquity,
[1:08:43] and in sin did my mother conceive me.
[1:08:48] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:08:51] Learn to confess your sin before the
[1:08:53] Lord.
[1:08:56] Apply the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is where my weakness is.
[1:09:03] Lord, this is where my trespass is.
[1:09:07] Wash me. Deliver me from this kind of
[1:09:10] situation.
[1:09:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Use the
[1:09:14] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So David
[1:09:19] admitted his weakness
[1:09:23] and then he confessed and called upon
[1:09:25] the name of the Lord
[1:09:28] and the Lord forgave him of his sin
[1:09:32] and that is the same thing when the
[1:09:34] prodical son came back to the father
[1:09:38] he was forgiven
[1:09:40] praise the name of and that's the same
[1:09:42] thing we did also to do
[1:09:45] Lord I'm coming back Lord I want to be
[1:09:48] reconciled with you. Lord, I want to
[1:09:51] walk in the path you have prepared for
[1:09:52] me.
[1:09:55] Praise the name of
[1:09:57] Isaiah 1 verse 16.
[1:10:03] The Bible says, "Wash you, make you
[1:10:07] clean, put away the evil of your doings
[1:10:10] from before mine eyes to do evil.
[1:10:29] Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Relieve
[1:10:33] the oppressed. Judge the fatherless.
[1:10:36] Plead for the widow.
[1:10:56] Come now and let us reason together,
[1:11:00] says the Lord. Though your sins be as
[1:11:04] scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
[1:11:08] Though they be red like crimson, they
[1:11:10] shall be as wool. If you be willing and
[1:11:13] obedient, you shall eat the good of the
[1:11:16] land.
[1:11:42] praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[1:11:44] "Come and let us reason together."
[1:11:48] So you come to God.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And you know when you come to God,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; don't come with yourself righteousness.
[1:11:58] The Bible gives an ex a parable
[1:12:02] of two people who went to the temple.
[1:12:06] One was a Pharisee.
[1:12:08] When he went to the temple,
[1:12:11] he started talking about his
[1:12:12] righteousness
[1:12:15] and say, you know, the Bible says he
[1:12:18] would lift his head high.
[1:12:21] Oh Lord, I thank you. I fast two times a
[1:12:24] week.
[1:12:26] I touch
[1:12:28] everything. And then he started
[1:12:30] despising another. I'm not like the
[1:12:32] other one.
[1:12:34] And then the other publican
[1:12:37] bowed down himself
[1:12:40] and said, Lord have mercy upon me.
[1:12:45] And then the Bible says the publican
[1:12:51] went back home justified
[1:12:55] more than the Pharisees.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So now when you come to the Lord,
[1:13:01] you imagine Daniel
[1:13:04] could do everything he felt he would do
[1:13:07] which was right.
[1:13:11] praying in the morning, praying in the
[1:13:13] afternoon, praying in the evening, even
[1:13:16] when they were still young.
[1:13:19] You know, the Bible says they could not
[1:13:22] defile themselves with the food of the
[1:13:24] land,
[1:13:26] he was honestly depending upon God.
[1:13:31] But when he came to the presence of God,
[1:13:35] he started confessing
[1:13:38] saying, "Lord have mercy upon us. We
[1:13:41] have been rebellious.
[1:13:43] We have not been hearing what the word
[1:13:45] says. We have not been obeying what the
[1:13:47] word tells us to do.
[1:13:50] Come before God.
[1:13:52] Confess your weaknesses.
[1:13:55] Say, "Lord, every time I'm doing
[1:13:58] something which is wrong,
[1:14:00] I'm thinking something which is wrong,
[1:14:03] wash me by the blood of Jesus.
[1:14:06] Forgive me for my failures.
[1:14:09] Forgive me for my mistakes.
[1:14:12] Every time somebody criticizes me,
[1:14:15] I criticize back. I abuse them. I don't
[1:14:20] wish them good
[1:14:22] because all the time
[1:14:24] Satan wants to make sure
[1:14:28] that you are always contrary to the way
[1:14:30] of the Lord
[1:14:33] in your thoughts in your speech in your
[1:14:36] action.
[1:14:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So that
[1:14:40] when you come before the Lord,
[1:14:43] Lord wash me.
[1:14:46] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[1:14:48] you look at the scriptures in the Old
[1:14:50] Testament,
[1:14:52] they had daily sacrifices.
[1:14:58] Every day they had a cleansing process.
[1:15:04] Praise the name of our Lord. We also
[1:15:06] have some kind of like daily dedication
[1:15:09] to the Lord.
[1:15:14] In the morning, you rise up and thank
[1:15:15] the Lord for the day he has given you.
[1:15:19] commit that hold into the hands of the
[1:15:21] Lord.
[1:15:22] Lord, lead me through this day. Lead me
[1:15:25] through this day, the victories.
[1:15:29] Sometimes you don't know the temptations
[1:15:30] that are waiting you at your place of
[1:15:32] work.
[1:15:36] or the trials that are along the road
[1:15:40] like maybe you are moving on the road,
[1:15:44] you know, and then somebody just comes
[1:15:46] and annoys you,
[1:15:49] you end up abusing that person
[1:15:52] or feeling bad about that person
[1:15:55] or somebody hurts you or you expect this
[1:15:58] person to do this kind of thing. You
[1:16:01] expect somebody to do something
[1:16:03] and then they don't do it. So all the
[1:16:06] time you find that you are battling.
[1:16:09] Your spirit is always troubled
[1:16:13] coming up. Every time something else is
[1:16:16] coming up.
[1:16:18] You need to have time and see that that
[1:16:21] is washed away.
[1:16:24] Praise the name of Lord deliver me from
[1:16:27] this kindness.
[1:16:29] Every day see that there is a cleansing.
[1:16:34] There is a washing.
[1:16:36] There is a separation from those things.
[1:16:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:16:43] go to the book of John.
[1:16:53] John chapter 20
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; and then verse 23.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Soever sins you remit they are remitted
[1:17:04] unto them. And soever sins you retain
[1:17:07] they are retained.
[1:17:14] John chapter 20 verse 23.
[1:17:31] Now he was telling the disciples
[1:17:34] to remit sins.
[1:17:37] Now
[1:17:40] what the Catholic Church thinks or says
[1:17:46] the church can remit sins.
[1:17:50] But that's not true.
[1:17:52] Now, the remission of sins
[1:17:56] comes by the preaching of the gospel of
[1:17:59] Jesus Christ.
[1:18:02] Now when somebody accepts the gospel
[1:18:06] and obeys what the word of God is
[1:18:08] telling him to do,
[1:18:11] then their sins are remitted.
[1:18:14] But if they reject the gospel,
[1:18:17] their sins are retained.
[1:18:21] Praise the name of our Lord. And so it's
[1:18:23] also the same thing now with us.
[1:18:27] Now we have the message of the hour.
[1:18:31] Praise the name of our Lord. And so sin
[1:18:35] is unbelief.
[1:18:38] Unbelief in the message that God has
[1:18:40] given to us.
[1:18:44] Unbelief in the word that God has given
[1:18:47] to us
[1:18:49] in John chapter 16.
[1:18:54] And then in verse 7 to verse 9,
[1:18:58] he says, "Nevertheless, I tell you the
[1:19:01] truth, it's expedient for you that I go
[1:19:04] away. For if I go not away, the
[1:19:07] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[1:19:10] I depart, I will send him unto you.
[1:19:28] And when he is come, he will reprove the
[1:19:31] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[1:19:35] judgment of sin because they believe not
[1:19:38] on me.
[1:19:48] Because unbelief
[1:19:51] is what sin is.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Unbelief
[1:19:57] is sin.
[1:19:59] Praise the name of our Lord. When God
[1:20:01] told them, don't eat of the tree,
[1:20:05] they didn't believe him,
[1:20:08] so they sinned.
[1:20:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So now when
[1:20:13] they sinned
[1:20:16] then the attributes of sin come out of
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:22] adultery,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; fornication,
[1:20:26] lying.
[1:20:28] So sin is unbelief
[1:20:32] in the word of God.
[1:20:35] Praise the name of our Lord. In John
[1:20:37] chapter 3
[1:20:39] and then verse 18,
[1:20:43] he that believeth on him is not
[1:20:46] condemned,
[1:20:48] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:20:51] already because he has not believed in
[1:20:54] the name of the only begotten son of
[1:20:57] God.
[1:21:11] Now you see that in the days of the Lord
[1:21:13] Jesus Christ,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; they were priests,
[1:21:18] they were Pharisees, they were scribes,
[1:21:21] men that you would write about their
[1:21:24] lives and you don't get anything done
[1:21:26] which was wrong in their life.
[1:21:31] like the other man when he went to the
[1:21:33] temple he says I don't do anything evil
[1:21:38] like the rich young ruler
[1:21:40] when he came to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:43] and then the Lord told him about the
[1:21:45] commandments
[1:21:47] do not do not do this do not do this he
[1:21:51] said all those things I've done from my
[1:21:54] childhood
[1:21:57] but what lth I
[1:22:00] he had been doing the commandments.
[1:22:05] But he saw that there is something that
[1:22:07] was lacking in him.
[1:22:10] He lacked eternal life.
[1:22:13] The Pharisees, we are following the law
[1:22:16] to the dot.
[1:22:20] But now when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] comes,
[1:22:24] when the Lord Jesus Christ comes,
[1:22:27] you know the fulfillment of all the law,
[1:22:33] they didn't believe in him. And then he
[1:22:36] says, your sin remains.
[1:22:40] Sin is unbelief.
[1:22:44] So he says, he that believeth not on him
[1:22:50] It doesn't matter how much you've kept
[1:22:52] the law.
[1:22:55] If you don't believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:22:58] Christ,
[1:23:00] you perish in your sins.
[1:23:03] Praise the name of Lord. So believing
[1:23:07] whom the Lord has sent,
[1:23:12] praise the name of is what remits our
[1:23:16] sins.
[1:23:19] because that is having faith in what the
[1:23:21] Lord is doing.
[1:23:25] Praise the name of our Lord. So, whoever
[1:23:27] didn't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:31] perished in their sin.
[1:23:34] Praise the name of our Lord. And so, we
[1:23:36] have also had seven church age message.
[1:23:42] Every church had its own message.
[1:23:48] Every age has its word for that day.
[1:23:54] And the message that was sent
[1:23:59] is where the atonement laid.
[1:24:03] Praise the name of our Lord. Because
[1:24:06] right now the way we read in the
[1:24:08] scriptures in John chapter one,
[1:24:11] in the beginning was the word
[1:24:15] and the word was with God AND THE WORD
[1:24:18] WAS GOD.
[1:24:20] Then in verse 14 of John chapter one
[1:24:25] became flesh. Why did the word become
[1:24:28] flesh?
[1:24:30] That the word can shed blood.
[1:24:34] Praise the name of OUR LORD. BECAUSE
[1:24:36] WITHOUT THE THE BODY,
[1:24:39] there wouldn't be any blood.
[1:24:42] Now, God had to put on body
[1:24:46] in order to to pour out blood
[1:24:50] which washes away our sins.
[1:24:53] And now when he shed his blood,
[1:24:57] the Bible says we are redeemed by the
[1:25:00] blood of God
[1:25:02] in Acts 20 verse 28.
[1:25:07] Praise the name of our Lord. Now that
[1:25:09] blood of God
[1:25:11] has now become the word of God.
[1:25:15] Before in the beginning it was the word
[1:25:18] and then the word became the blood
[1:25:21] and now the blood
[1:25:24] is now the word.
[1:25:27] Praise the name of our lord. So the word
[1:25:29] that is given to us
[1:25:32] in our age
[1:25:35] is where we find the blood
[1:25:38] and that's where we find forgiveness of
[1:25:40] ours.
[1:25:42] Praise the name of God. So the rich
[1:25:44] young ruler
[1:25:47] much as he would keep the commandments
[1:25:50] but when he rejected
[1:25:53] the word of his day
[1:25:56] he perished in his sins.
[1:25:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So we see
[1:26:01] the same thing that's happening now.
[1:26:05] Atonement,
[1:26:07] forgiveness of our sins
[1:26:10] is right where the message of the hour
[1:26:13] is.
[1:26:16] Praise the name of Lord. That's where we
[1:26:19] can find forgiveness of our sins.
[1:26:23] Because sin is unbelief.
[1:26:26] Unbelief in what?
[1:26:29] In the word of God.
[1:26:31] Praise the name of Lord. Whoever didn't
[1:26:33] believe the message of Noah
[1:26:37] in the days of Noah when God told them
[1:26:41] go in the ark and they said Noah you an
[1:26:45] old man you are just joking
[1:26:48] I don't care your ark
[1:26:51] I'll have another alternative
[1:26:54] all those who didn't hear the message of
[1:26:56] Noah
[1:26:58] they perished in their sins
[1:27:01] they perished in their unbelief.
[1:27:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Even now,
[1:27:09] we have the message of the hour.
[1:27:12] So, we do well to obey the message of
[1:27:14] the hour.
[1:27:16] That's where the forgiveness of sins
[1:27:18] are.
[1:27:21] That's where you can get rid of
[1:27:23] unbelief.
[1:27:26] So, you take the word of God seriously.
[1:27:31] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[1:27:32] message says this,
[1:27:35] take it as the word of God.
[1:27:38] When the rich young was told, "Go and
[1:27:40] sell what you have,"
[1:27:43] that was the word of God. When he
[1:27:46] refused it, he perished.
[1:27:50] Praise the name of our Lord. So, we have
[1:27:52] the message of the day
[1:27:55] and that's the message that we take now.
[1:28:00] where there is forgiveness of our sins.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Now in John chapter 3 verse 36,
[1:28:10] he says, "He that believeth on the Son
[1:28:14] has everlasting life, and he that
[1:28:16] believeth not the Son shall not see
[1:28:19] life, but the wrath of God abides on
[1:28:22] him.
[1:28:32] Praise the name of God. He says, "He
[1:28:35] that believeth on the Son
[1:28:38] has eternal life, but he that does not
[1:28:42] believe.
[1:28:45] The wrath of God abides on him."
[1:28:49] We have the message of the hour
[1:28:52] that that returns our heart or turns our
[1:28:56] hearts back to the fathers.
[1:29:00] So it's always good to stand by the
[1:29:02] message.
[1:29:05] That's where you can overcome unbelief.
[1:29:10] Outside of the message of the hour,
[1:29:13] you'll be unbeliever.
[1:29:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:29:20] confession of our sins,
[1:29:23] our unbelief,
[1:29:25] the message
[1:29:27] guides us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:29:30] You know all the denomination churches
[1:29:32] are sayingd.
[1:29:38] But what are they getting saved from if
[1:29:40] they deny
[1:29:42] the council of God?
[1:29:45] Praise the name of our Lord. The message
[1:29:47] that the Lord has given unto us.
[1:29:51] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[1:29:53] it's just like a plant.
[1:29:55] When a plant is growing, it's all green.
[1:30:00] the different stages of justification,
[1:30:03] sanctification,
[1:30:05] baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[1:30:08] you know, justification,
[1:30:10] you know, maybe just as two leaves,
[1:30:14] then sanctification,
[1:30:17] you know, like a tassel or flower
[1:30:20] and then, you know, baptism of the Holy
[1:30:23] Spirit, restoration of gifts,
[1:30:28] a shark.
[1:30:30] But then inside the shark
[1:30:33] there is the seed.
[1:30:36] And now when all the life
[1:30:39] when the seed matures,
[1:30:42] all the life goes into the seed
[1:30:45] and all the other plant becomes dry.
[1:30:53] And this is the time we're living in
[1:30:56] that life is in the seat which is the
[1:31:00] message of the hour.
[1:31:02] Praise the name of so we need to see
[1:31:04] that we take it serious.
[1:31:07] Obey the message of the hour.
[1:31:10] Obey the word of God. What God has
[1:31:13] revealed to us.
[1:31:16] Praise the name of our Lord. What God
[1:31:18] was doing in the ministry of brother
[1:31:19] Brham.
[1:31:22] was a proof
[1:31:24] that this is the word that the Lord has
[1:31:26] given us today.
[1:31:29] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:31:31] where there is forgiveness of our sins.
[1:31:35] It's where the bleeding blood is.
[1:31:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Our sins
[1:31:46] are forgiven
[1:31:48] when we live in the message of the hour
[1:31:52] covered by the blood of Jesus.
[1:31:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Like in the
[1:31:57] Old Testament, the animal life would not
[1:32:00] come back.
[1:32:02] But in the New Testament,
[1:32:04] the life of Jesus Christ comes back to
[1:32:07] the worshiper.
[1:32:09] Praise the name of our Lord. So a proof
[1:32:11] that my sins have been forgiven.
[1:32:16] I get the life of Jesus Christ and that
[1:32:19] should always be our desire. Lord, I
[1:32:22] desire to live your life.
[1:32:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Living the
[1:32:27] life of Jesus Christ at your home.
[1:32:30] You're living that life at your place of
[1:32:32] work. You're living that life
[1:32:35] where you study from. You're living that
[1:32:36] life among the strangers where they
[1:32:39] don't know you.
[1:32:41] Still live the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:44] May God bless you.
[1:32:47] Amen. [applause]
[1:32:51] On Friday, we are going to have an
[1:32:53] overnight.
[1:32:56] Praise the name of our Lord. And on
[1:32:58] Sunday, we shall have two services.
[1:33:03] The morning service is for all of us.
[1:33:07] But then the afternoon is for the youth
[1:33:09] out of school.

[1:42:30] So you're dismissed in the name of Jesus
[1:42:32] Christ. You can sing the Psalm 93, the
[1:42:35] love of God. As we move on,
[1:42:39] the love of God
[1:42:44] is greater
[1:42:49] than tongue of pain.
[1:42:53] [music]
[1:42:54] Can never tell.
[1:43:00] It goes beyond
[1:43:04] [music and singing] the highest star
[1:43:09] [music]
[1:43:10] and richest to
[1:43:15] the [singing] Lord.
[1:43:21] I guilt [music] depend
[1:43:27] down [singing] with care.
[1:43:30] [music]
