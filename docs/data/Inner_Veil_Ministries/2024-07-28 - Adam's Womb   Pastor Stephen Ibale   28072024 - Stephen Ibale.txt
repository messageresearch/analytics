========================================

let's B our heads no word of thanks precious father we want to give thanks to you you brought back your children in your presence you love us so much your love for us as your children surpasses our love for our children and surpasses our love for each other your love is divine ours is natural yours is unconditional our condition so father each time we come before you we've come to the presence of the Unlimited Supply to which David says the Lord is my shepher I shall not so when we come before your presence help us to have the Liberty to express ourselves before you bless our service tonight in a special way in Jesus name amen amen so we thank God for this service today it's going to be a very short one but the Lord be gracious and bless us so Genesis chter one verse 27 that's where we are springing from and I like these coup meetings amen me verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him and female created he so God blessed them created blessed created blessed and God blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and the Earth and subdue it and and and and have dominion over the fish of the sea and and and and over the fall of the air and and and and everything every living thing that move upon you see it is a chain of blessing and you get into this and you get into this what a blessing God bless you you may be seated it's a chain and the chain is one link leading it to another okay so for the title tonight I want to speak about's wom's womb a womb is that area in a woman where a child is developed amen so a man does not have a wom much as he has a stomach he does not have a womb so very poor sometimes but a man doesn't have a womb we've got here maybe they can explain what is the so I think that's the area Adam so God created man as a unit he was male and female and called their name Adam but then he gave man in that single unit to be fruitful blessed and as I was speaking about the joints and blessing and blessing so being fruitful is the Capac to multiply the blessing amen that's being fruitful you have the capacity to multiply amen am and so Adam and Eve that unit not Adam and Eve but Adam in that unit he was blessed and he would multiply and then he carried that blessing with him even in the time when he was made flesh and even you know he was still carrying the sem with him that he had when he was still a spirit being in the natural he still could multiply he could replenish he could sub could have dominion now the blessing of God works like that you know which would come from a caterpillar to to it just keeps changing form the moment it comes into the first form it is sure that to enter into the second form enter into the third form and also this the way God had blessed Abraham I mean Adam that as long Adam was in the original form character and nature where God blessed him he would be fruitful and the moment is fruitful then he would also multiply he would also replenish the Earth he would also subdue it and he would even have dominion because that blessing was one joint into another another another but then for Adam to multiply in the natural aspect he needed his wom amen he needed his womb so we find out that in Genesis Chapter 2 Verse 18 God says I'll make him a help me for him where was that help that help me was a part of the unit that Adam was Adam being a spirit being and so when God made Adam and gave him a body to te the Earth that unit was dressed in that body but while in that body God says I'll give him a help meat so she was called help me for Adam to plant all the seeds of his mind because he was a teacher are you together with me he was a teacher and Eve was the church so Adam had had a work or an assignment to develop the character and nature of his [Music] wife now it's a responsibility of every man to design his wife okay because brother Bram in uh the message Mar and voice he made a very powerful statement which you can understand by virtue of Revelation he says that the devil was her designer and many people wonder how could have the devil been the designer of you see because the devil took over the work of Adam at a certain point where Adam was supposed to be the S of the seeds of his into this woman that whatsoever she was going to do she was going to do the will of Adam which was the will of God are you together with me so he had s the SE of the understanding of God and by S doing Adam would be designing his wife amen design the way she would dress design the way she would work the way she would raise her children all those seeds had to be planted into the mind of Eve are you together with me so it's exactly the same responsibility that when a man is going to marry he should have in his mind what a wife is and that when he finds one that meets his grace then he would do one thing he would start to design her are you together with me the word designs the word designs and when Adam didn't do it then the devil was her designer do you understand that yeah many people feel so bad about the statement but the devil designed her because you know she opened the of our church to a strange teacher the teacher was Adam and the church was Eve and you know this principles once we follow them they teach us how to leave as church and they teach us how to live as family so for us to have a productive family we have to have the same principle the man must have the right seeds of the word to plant in the womb of his wife to get the right kind of mother to raise his children because this woman here was Adam's womb when God told Adam that reproduce Adam could not have that capacity he needed a womb to raise the children so Adam here his womb was in you are there with me so when you get your wife there are so many things that you start picturing in the Journey of your walk with your wife you begin to sell your designer you begin to see how you are going to be satisfied which wish she should drink you begin to picture what kind of friends she would have you begin to picture what children you should have and you what kind of children should they be so it's a long journey of your mind and as you travel this long journey I take a junction you should allow this blessing to open up into the next Chanel of the bless are you together with me multiply I mean be fruitful and once you are fruitful in the physical room it is children amen and then replenish mean that now you are getting one after another give me Genesis so that we can be able to understand marriage starts on the day of your wedding when you choose really rather maybe a little back begins with your vow amen I think uh let's start with genesis8 first let's go there right there let me get back to my praise the Lord so yeah 28 rather not 18 forgive this old mind here and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful being fruitful is a potential to produce fruit he's not saying bring forth fruit he saying be I'm blessing you with the potential but when you step forward because you are fruitful and then you bring forth a child you already stepping into multiplication then you are replenishing amen then you are going to sub the Earth one step after another now that means that when God promes a blessing and you put there your first food it means that you have believed God then it's God who lift the next foot and put it in the next chain of the blessing okay I want you to understand this fairly well that God gives you a family and then as I said the moment you make your vow you've ceased to kind of uh uh trying to to cut her amen so everything is settled there is the future then you start talking about the house you start talking about children you are not continuing saying will you marry me that one is certain you are going over to the next you are talking real things the journey has started and then the children come it's just a beginning so in that particular instance the husband doesn't give up because he has been wed at the church and he says I do until death actually that vow is trying to say now have you been officially presented to me as my field I'm going to S the mind of God into the womb of your mind you are trying to get the picture you want and that picture is produced by the word you are talking about a wonderful wife who will make a beautiful home who will give you wonderful children you don't just wait at the wedding and after you've done that you go home you are not going to get what you want God made Adam and Eve and demanded from them he demanded from Adam to have a child Amen to reproduce himself and then that was going to be by Adam but Adam in a way at a point there was a [Applause] lapse and in that another farmer so in his father he sold something in the mind of amen and yet this e was B suppos to beam's wom's field she was called helpmate for I where seeds to design a good woman was supposed to be planted so once you appreciate her in the time of your courtship that's just step number one there is Step number two which is a daily continuous job so that you may continue as her teacher like a Christ when he found his church in her election and chose her that was not all it is a continuous work the church became a fi of the master so that the master that he can get a child in the image of the Father the St of a perfect man it's not something he does one day it's a so fellow in a home between a husband and wife is something that is constant Whenever there is a lapse the devil can plant a seed ofation amen he had to develop to the stage of Oneness of mind Amen Let the mind that was in Christ be in you the bride you together to me amen he was the teacher she was the church she was the ground she was growing towards the head so for us to have a productive family we must have the same principle the man must have the right seeds of the word to plant in the womb of his wife to get the right kind of mother raise his children is are you together with me yeah that's the relationship of husband and wife but if a man comes to you and says there is problem she left those she accepted to be where you are the problem you stop sewing seeds and in the morning exaltation with long suffer why didn't they give up in cour you understand what I finally it goes into the once you get to the right spot then something has been planted and then she begins to think different she begins to ask but why did come to Mar why am I behaving like this you see what I mean yeah with long suffering you are trying to make your form amen out of your wife you plant this seed you plant that seed you PL the other SE and then the people start saying she's not what she used to do when she came here she was a different woman that man is a good family he knows the seeds to you don't only s the natural seed to get the children out of her but also to get the right mother in that mind the fth gospel of your children because a sister who is very impatient will raise the children patient so you know what areas because you live with her in the morning in the afternoon in the evening through the night you know what areas to work with it's just like the church the Lord found us we accepted yes but we had so many rust areas some of them taken him 10 years but to be a husband is not to give up you are trying to work around your womb because you don't have another woman you are trying to work in such a way that you may cause this lady the womb which God gave you to respect her own wom so we have fights in our families because we are not ready when the children came we were not ready the children came in when the womb was not properly designed we spent all these times all these years all these months for ad to get to fulfill the promise of being fruitful there had to be a separation between male and female that the male might have a womb to raise the promise are you together with me so let the young woman understand what it means to be a wife you are not just the dominant [Applause] figure no a dominant you are not the dominant figure amen because you will help me amen that's the reason where you came you don't become a dominant figure because you are Adam's womb you are Adam's field he s in you the seeds of the world you receive them because it's this man who has the vision of the kind of family he wants to have God has blessed you to be the ground that will raise those children so you sanctify yourself for the job that God called you to that family to be a beding ground amen and the female will be destroyed when she marries a male that doesn't have any seed she's just in a house when she was the eggs are there when she wants to get some beef the meat is there when she wants to eat some chicken the meat is there the man is working there and night but he has forgotten that apart from making her physically happy he has a right and responsibility to prepare as a mother so you find that some of these sisters they get destroyed as fi because they mared it areas where the man has no seed to plant he doesn't even understand the godhead he doesn't know what it means to be a man he doesn't know what it means a woman to be a woman and as unprepared as they are the biolog does CH the child will come and the mother is not ready the child doesn't have gospel because the man sold nothing in that home you always hear kids crying because they are raising them on sticks the children don't know what to do we know that in raising of the ship of the sheep fall the the shepherd would go ahead of the ship and the ship would fall that's Christ and the church husband and wife what have you sown in that family for them to walk after you then the children will try to go in front but they don't know where to go and that's now when you start [Applause] King because there was no seeds that was sown in there to prepare for the moment where you are are you together with me she will not know where to place her hand amen because you saw no seing her and then the next thing she becomes a smart lady because need always dictates she try to occupy your position simply because you did so no and then the next thing you start running to church the woman is becoming the head of the of the home she's now dominant she tells me this she sees an EMP space husband let us Pi our positions these ladies here they are helpmates they are just your womb you are the seed s you design her into motherhood are you together with me her parents they gave birth to a body and good enough she became a Christian but you you the vision she was going to be your wife and so you've got the image and the picture of what your wife is supposed to be so when Adam saw Eve he says hey she's born of my B Flesh of My Flesh she came out of M she shall be called woman she recogniz the kind of woman he needed and that was what she was you you are not going to create her but she's going to come your way by marriage and immediately after she says yes yes you begin to design her are you together with me you joke with this those moments when you are trying to to try to get your you know your your husband you talk to I've got daughters you talk to them and they are not hearing and they looking at you their ears are very far away they can even he that is William and fix the they know what time they call when they in engagement we are ready to listen and here and accept anything you see me I've been around here when all of you are getting married I've been even when was that one was m they would come to me they want me to but how can you stand between those you lose that moment where you should plant every seed to what a mother must be you are busy talking about her are beautiful girl is here but when you came praise the Lord I've watched them some of them brother Tom brother all of them brother when they were about to get married they were ready now they are finding boyfriend and this is the pastor they would run come to my house brother all of them then you would really see those girls you would talk to them they are not hearing anything they waiting for maybe he will come are you together with me at that time the ground is ready you start sowing your seat you know when we make a family you know we need the praying family you know when children come you want children to be this way are you together with me because you found a womb you preparing a womb to carry your seed you know what your children are supposed to be there is no father who is just there to bring forth children without God he knew you from before the foundation of the world he knew what kind of child he wanted to have and as a Christian that's the same principle and the same basis you may not be able to create them the same way God created you into his own image in a particular way but you should have a contribution to build the nature and character of your children by sing the right SE in your wife she's Adam's wom both spiritually to receive the spiritual SE of the world because even after I have preached and she doesn't understand God knows that there is a special bond between husband and wife she was told to go back and ask husband at home except for sister har praise the Lord but you know the reason way God created the husband and wife the Ison way wife will be able to understand [Music] oh and then sistera will say I tell you brother PR I him once understand everything yeah that's what it should be she has told you from A to Z so she just say this was this when I said this yeah then this is this not so God gave you a womb spiritual physical plant the seeds of the world design your wife for the spiritual seed Adam was the teacher and for the natural seed Adam was supposed to be the planter are you together with me but in that unguarded moment listen to what brother Bram say a woman in the beginning he took the woman from Adam and Adam and wife are really W but that was done to reproduce themselves again to put them in flesh but he took the femin part of the man and made the woman of it Hallelujah hallel Adam go and reproduce by the way the womb is in you let me remove it and put it here are you together with me sister Juliet sister brother [Music] your brother just you my you see those are teachers and that's what they do to children ATO praise the Lord listen to this other quote the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself amen that's why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to reproduce another Son of God so now we are talking about the woman was given to Adam that Adam May reproduce himself by way of the womb of his wife but then this Adam is reproducing his nature that's what the scripture says reprod himself so he knew who he was and he knew what he needed to put in Eve as a mother to raise his child His Image okay now the serpent robed both WS when he took Eve in that secret moment he had stolen both WS he had taken the spiritual women of her mind and the moment he stole it he was able to get the natural are you together with it so the mind is so powerful but he was a husband you must be sewing the right seads in your husband's mind I mean your wife's mind because when the devil got the man he was able to get the body he also robbed the natural womb and planted a cane in there but it all started when Eve sought for knowledge are you together with it's very important for husband and wife to always have valuable communication if anything ever comes into your family that you cannot communicate that's a very dangerous moment no Man was created that he cannot have Fellowship If you deny your wife Fellowship that's very dangerous you can get upset but never choose to keep quiet on your wife or to keep quiet on your husband you know she's chewing but she doesn't that's not a Christian way and let me tell you that person is not feeling that one everybody only one person his wife his husb the rest of the people they laugh and they talk that's opening up a mind at that time anything but can be planted in the M keep Fellowship open it's very important for husband and wife to maintain valuable communication wives should not make decisions in life whether big or small outside of the knowledge of the husband you see I was having fellowship with brother Andreas this thing called the mind is a very terrible thing very tell and let me tell you the greatest ever fault brother Bram says it's fault in the man that's where now you have your battles so this is what happened the woman has decided take a lonely walk it was not normal and there was a serent who was the head prefect of all the ad because he was more sub all the animals of the field he was the head boy he knew the geograph of the farm he knew where to stand because Eve was going to pass that and the worst thing was Eve opening up just to talk to The Serpent and the serpent said certain things we are a mixed crowd here but the devil aimed at the that if I get mind I can get to her soul to her womb so while he says the Lord say should not eat says yeah not even to touch then the the serpent says do you know why because when you eat you'll be like a god knowing good and bad and then says okay okay I think I want to know and the CH open but it was so powerful that if could not close that chel are you together with me the channel was so powerful that it opened up the the hormones of her body she has been with Adam all the time and those kind of negative hormons had never been released but for the first time behaved in a certain way and theil that's how dangerous it is sometimes once you open up your mind you are going to fight but it's so hard to close your mind after you opened it for the devil you open up your mind and you want to hear certain things that brother the thief is Wizard is actually this you try to do your best and tell that brother go Bless but you opened up a child the devil knows that the moment he gets your mind he can be able to get the there's a lot of negative things which go around we open up our minds and we may never get healed out of them that's Mr Lucifer Lucifer that's how he works all of a sudden if could handle her body she wondered why she opened up her mind so even if you are seeking for ccel from your past on between husband and wife it is always so good for both of you to be there are you together with me yeah because the pastor will hear it this way and will give her a judgment based on how she told the story and now that gets into her mind sett in ands HB any me brothers are you there Genesis 2:25 the scripture says and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed they were in an inocent world but after that the Mind open up AEL and began to think and act different but before that they were both naked and were not ashamed they had nothing to hide they were open one to another we should not give one opportunity to a third hand in our [Music] marriages amen the serpent was the third hand and opened channels that even the teacher Adam could not close so that allow third Channel I me third to open the mind of your wife sometimes you will never be able to close let us keep the bond of our marriages let us be open one to another if you are broke be open about it and when you have the money be open about it amen are you together with me and let us keep both wombs the spiritual womb amen and the natural in the natural marriages here amen you've got a sacred commitment to your husband and as a bride you've got a sacred virtue to protect as the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now when God created the woman he created her in such a way that she was supposed to give a man child and also the child are you together with me I've always been wondering why he say they shall be saved in child bearing brother bham tried to touch it but he couldn't get to the bottom of it when they were writing scripture sometimes they were dealing with the character that was in the SE in the time the scripture was being written now in the Gentile Temple worship there were priestesses and these were virgins and they stayed right there as Temple priestesses they never married so Paul writes to Timothy no let our sisters be married they even be saved in child he was trying to abrace about that he custom that if you are so spiritual I will not marry he says no they'll be saved even in child so now you understand [Music] that's are you together with me yeah so when you marry wife the honor of every woman is the ability to give a man a child if a child doesn't come it's just unfortunate but every mother the desire is to give a man a child and sisters you are the Ws to give a man a I mean a child and to have the ability to nure that child as a first teacher in the formative [Music] years the husband marries his wife Des to the character of a mother the mother gets her child natur and gives basis of a faithful child to God because women have got a very strong influence over both their husbands and their children she can be an influence for the better for the wor so the question is sister I mean brother have you sown the right seat to design the character of your wife if you have done sister sister are you going to be the first positive teacher for your child [Music] you are a very strong influence look at zakas wife and her name was re she had a powerful influence over zakas and compelled zakas to see Jesus are you going to be the kind of wife or you are going to be the kind of wife that will try to separate your husband from the influence of your pastor you are a powerful [Music] influence are you together with me the prophet says little old zakas in the Bible his wife Rebecca she was a follower of the Lord Jesus it was her influence that helped bring him down there we are told by history she wanted zakas to believe Jesus so much that he was a prophet and she told him honey that man is a prophet I have seen him stand there and perceive their hearts now look the scripture he has exactly vated here are you together with me what kind of wife are you are you a good beding ground are the kind of wife that will bring your husband closer to church or you are the kind of wife that will separate her from church brothers are you there women are Pilot's Wife was powerful his wife sent to him when he was in the courtroom and he was trying to judge and sentence Jesus and he says have nothing to do with that just man I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him and pilot pulled back the power of a woman are you positive power or negative power talk about herodia herodia Herod was wife to Philip who was a brother to Herod Herod amen fin [Music] Mar I think when phod I am Herod I should have married Herod and he went and took him away from his brother and she was a very strong influence over Herod negative influence and he caused the death of John the Baptist her daughter Dan in herod's [Applause] birthday and for a word just for the Baptist head you know she danced went to the king and the King said what can I give [Music] you shees again went to the mother the King has said I have danced what should I give you says ask for the head of John the Baptist then she daned back the head of John the bapti powerful women and indeed her had nothing to do the power of the woman took the head of John the bapti so when God wanted to do something special with the men who were coming as Covenant men he chose to push the original influence through the mother they knew what God was going to do with their children even before the father's knew the power of a woman must be used POS and you men tap into that power plant seeds of character because the uses it negatively you will not like it Jacob is only the mother who knew God's plan for his life amen the angel spoke to manoah's wife manah the mother of Samson the father knew nothing when it came to Jesus the angel spoke to Mary Joseph knew nothing and when came to the prophet of this age he saw the mother who saw the pill of light at the birth of the son when it came to John Wesley is the mother who had the power of influence if you don't s good seeds in them you lose the children parents are you here how many fathers die lamenting when children have deserted them and they care for the mothers am I speaking some here the fathers failed to S the right seeds bus we are busy you know Franc she's working com back it becomes bad when you fail to get the Fifth Gospel jeel got into the house took over ahab's mind's before could take her mind and that was a disaster sisters don't you think you are okay because you control your husband you make it impossible for him to plant these seeds of the vision of his family but that part God didn't give it to you he gave it to the Man I normally don't do this marriage services but I'm so much of a believer in principles if the principles are wrong you can never get the result [Music] right in the leadership message and I'll leave it there maybe when the Lord gives me another opportunity I'll come back again the prophet says the first this is in raising children now is the mother's kind [Music] then the father's word after the mother gives you your first step then look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he the head of the house so this is the principle of it the father S talks you and then you become a wife when you become a wife he PLS the mind of Christ that makes a mother and then God made a mother in such a way that a little child understands her better and then says okay raise up this child but if you retain this child and don't always subit her to the you will lose her but now after rising up you put to the hands of the father to plant continuing wisdom you will have children okay so when the children fall back into the hearts of the Father the father knows the next step he will influence them with the same seed that made the mother hallelujah hallelujah and finally they will be at the altar father we are giving our lives to you from that day we have a Christian Home amen so when the children fall back amen from the fall in the hands of the father from the hands of the father into the hands of the shepherd when he gets interested when the pastor gets interested with the lives of your children and you are a spiritual family don't interfere God bless you do [Applause] you Adam's womb not Eve's is Adam's wom you are Adam sister sister let the husband s all the necessary seeds as you accept them you building a family on the rock of Revelation Christ himself God bless you amen God bless you and continue praying for brother James I'm sure still in the pit in harim God bless [Music]
