[9:20] Jesus we are thankful again for bringing
[9:22] us
[9:24] together said two three are gathered in
[9:27] your
[9:28] name you will be there in their
[9:31] midst and Lord we believe you are here
[9:33] in our
[9:35] midst so we call upon your
[9:38] name you come and speak to us father you

[9:45] likewise Lord May every need of your

[9:53] we are depending upon you Lord
[9:56] Jesus bless us all together Lord touch
[9:59] those who are weak give them strength
[10:03] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:06] us amen amen let us go to John
[10:15] 14 we're reading from verse we're
[10:18] reading verse 26
[10:21] only John Chapter 14 verse
[10:26] 26 it says but the comforter which is
[10:31] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[10:34] in my name he shall teach you all things
[10:38] and bring all things to your remembrance
[10:42] whatsoever I have said unto
[10:57] you may God blessing
[11:00] word you may be
[11:04] seated I greet in the name of our Lord
[11:06] Jesus
[11:07] Christ you're welcome for this
[11:10] service so I want to preach on the
[11:13] subject the Holy Ghost is the inside
[11:19] teacher praise the name of our Lord so
[11:22] we see the Bible is telling
[11:24] us that when the Holy Ghost is come
[11:30] he will teach us all
[11:33] things and not only teaching us but also
[11:37] bring all
[11:40] things bring all things to our
[11:45] remembrance whatsoever the Lord has
[11:49] said praise the name of our Lord and you
[11:52] see the Holy
[11:54] Ghost as we've always
[11:57] said it is the holy
[12:00] ghost that teaches you the
[12:03] word it is the holy ghost that brings
[12:07] conviction to Your
[12:09] Heart Like You know the first time you
[12:11] heard about the Gospel of Jesus
[12:15] Christ it was the Holy
[12:17] Spirit through the voice you were
[12:21] hearing that brought that word to
[12:24] you and that word brought
[12:28] conviction
[12:29] praise the name of our Lord it was the
[12:31] spirit using that
[12:34] person or using that voice or using the
[12:38] text you
[12:40] read you know to bring conviction to
[12:44] you praise the name of our Lord and so
[12:47] the Holy Ghost LED you into
[12:52] justification when you repented of your
[12:54] sins it was the spirit of God telling
[12:58] you that you were wrong it was the
[13:01] spirit of God telling you that you need
[13:04] to
[13:05] repent and it was the spirit of God
[13:09] praise the name of our Lord that enabled
[13:11] you to receive the water
[13:15] baptism praise the name of our Lord you
[13:17] wouldn't start the journey by
[13:20] yourself but it had to be the
[13:23] spirit that called you and then you see
[13:27] that the spirit keeps on speaking to you
[13:29] through the
[13:31] word and now as you continue on obeying
[13:34] the
[13:35] word then the spirit sanctifies
[13:39] you the spirit washes away all your
[13:45] unrighteousness through believing the
[13:48] word because that's why the Bible says
[13:51] sanctify them by thy
[13:54] truth Thy word is
[13:56] truth so it was the Holy Ghost
[14:00] that justifies you it is the holy ghost
[14:04] that sanctifies
[14:06] you praise the name of our Lord because
[14:09] like last time we were looking at
[14:11] it that the blood
[14:14] speaks praise the name of our Lord and
[14:17] what does the blood
[14:19] speak we can go get some of this
[14:23] spot praise the name of our
[14:27] Lord in the the message
[14:31] token it
[14:33] says now we find we also find in Hebrews
[14:39] 1224 that the New
[14:42] Testament the blood speaks better
[14:46] things the blood is
[14:50] speaking then the blood has got a
[14:55] voice and the voice of the blood
[14:59] is the word the word is
[15:05] identified by the voice of the
[15:08] blood and the voice of the
[15:11] blood is the holy
[15:15] ghost that brings life it is life and
[15:19] brings life to the
[15:22] word and quickens it so we see it's now
[15:26] the holy
[15:27] ghost that has has been speaking to you
[15:31] and whenever you've been hearing the
[15:33] word of God you are obeying the Holy
[15:37] Spirit you were obeying what the Holy
[15:40] Ghost was
[15:41] teaching praise the name of our Lord and
[15:44] you see the Bible also tells
[15:47] us in John
[15:54] 1526 John
[15:57] 15:26 it says but but when the comforter
[16:00] is
[16:01] come whom I will send unto you from the
[16:06] father even the spirit of
[16:09] Truth which proceeds from the
[16:12] father he shall testify of
[16:18] me
[16:20] testifying shall speak of
[16:22] Christ you shall speak the word of
[16:25] Christ so you see it is always the Hol
[16:30] spirit that has been speaking to
[16:33] us through the word of God praise the
[16:37] name of our Lord so when you are talking
[16:39] about the Holy Spirit you're not talking
[16:42] about something so
[16:44] mysterious you're not talking about
[16:46] something that is far
[16:48] away but you are talking about the holy
[16:51] spirit that has already been given and
[16:55] you're talking about the Holy Ghost that
[16:58] always speaks to
[17:00] praise the name of our Lord we're not
[17:02] talking about something so
[17:04] far oh we not talking about
[17:07] something it's only the other Church
[17:09] which has the
[17:10] spirit only the other minister has the
[17:13] spirit we are talking about where the
[17:16] true word of God is
[17:19] preached it is the spirit that
[17:22] preaches praise the name of our Lord and
[17:24] so if you can obey that
[17:27] word then the Holy Spirit
[17:31] himself will take you through what he
[17:33] wants to take
[17:34] you and then he brings you to
[17:38] Perfection praise the name of our Lord
[17:41] so then we need to hear what the spirit
[17:44] says when you go in the Book of
[17:48] Revelation praise the name of our Lord
[17:51] The Book of
[17:53] Revelation and then we go to chapter
[17:57] two
[18:03] Revelation Chapter
[18:05] 2 and let us read in verse
[18:11] S he that has an ear let him hear what
[18:15] the spirit says unto the churches to him
[18:19] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[18:21] the tree of life which is in the midst
[18:23] of the paradise of
[18:27] God
[18:37] you see in verse seven he
[18:40] saying Le that has an
[18:43] ear let what the
[18:48] spirit says to the
[18:50] churches but then who was speaking
[18:54] this in verse chapter 1 verse
[18:57] 19
[18:59] it says write the things which thou Hast
[19:01] seen and the things which are and the
[19:03] things which shall be
[19:11] Hereafter in verse 17 he introduces
[19:15] himself and when I saw him I fell at his
[19:18] feet as dead and he laid his right hand
[19:21] upon me saying unto me fear not I am the
[19:25] first and the
[19:27] last
[19:40] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[19:44] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[19:47] have the keys of hell and
[19:57] death
[20:01] praise the name of our Lord so the Bible
[20:04] is saying it is Christ who was speaking
[20:08] to John on the aisle of
[20:12] patimos but now when Christ was speaking
[20:14] to
[20:15] John he says it is the
[20:19] spirit praise the name of the Lord that
[20:22] speaketh to the churches so the
[20:24] preaching of the word it is the spirit
[20:27] of God
[20:29] that preaches to us that speaks to us
[20:33] praise the name of our Lord so you're
[20:35] not talking about the Holy Ghost being
[20:37] far away from you but you are talking
[20:39] about the Holy Spirit who always comes
[20:43] and speaks to you speak through through
[20:46] the ministry speak through the
[20:49] preps speak through through the
[20:52] scriptures when you start reading your
[20:55] Bible when you start reading the message
[20:58] book
[20:59] it is the holy
[21:01] spirit that speaks to
[21:03] you praise the name of our Lord the holy
[21:07] ghost that uses the
[21:09] minister it's the holy ghost that speak
[21:11] through the
[21:13] Tex it's the holy ghost that speaks
[21:15] through the
[21:17] scriptures so we are not talking about
[21:19] something that is far from
[21:21] us we are talking about the Holy Spirit
[21:25] coming to speak to us praise the name of
[21:29] now in first
[21:31] Timothy 4 verse
[21:41] 1 the Bible
[21:44] says now the spirit speaks expressly
[21:49] that in the latter times some shall
[21:52] depart from the faith giving he to
[21:55] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[22:13] now see the the spirit is
[22:15] prophesy so is the spirit
[22:18] speaking the spirit is speaking through
[22:23] scriptures praise the name of our Lord
[22:25] the spirit is using the
[22:27] scriptures
[22:29] to speak to us and now when we also go
[22:33] to Peter First Peter chapter
[22:35] 1 and then in verse
[22:38] 11 the Bible says searching what or what
[22:43] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[22:46] which was in them did signify when it
[22:49] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[22:52] Christ and the glory that should
[22:57] follow
[23:10] praise the name of the Lord it says even
[23:13] in the
[23:14] Bible in the Old
[23:16] Testament it was actually the holy men
[23:19] of
[23:21] God who were moved by the spirit of
[23:25] Christ and then they did the things
[23:28] under
[23:29] inspiration they spoke things under
[23:32] inspiration it was no longer their
[23:36] mind it was the spirit of
[23:39] God that was moving upon
[23:43] them praise the name of our and wonder
[23:46] the Bible
[23:47] says if we can also go to Second Peter
[23:51] chapter
[23:53] 1 and then
[23:56] verse the Bible says knowing this first
[24:00] that no Prophecy of the scripture if of
[24:03] any private
[24:21] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[24:25] in Old Time by the will of man but holy
[24:29] men of God spoke as they were moved by
[24:33] the Holy
[24:51] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so
[24:54] the Bible is telling us all the prophets
[24:57] in the bible
[24:59] they were
[25:00] inspired and the Holy Ghost was speaking
[25:04] through
[25:05] them so then we have the Bible written
[25:09] by the Holy
[25:11] Spirit and then we need the same Holy
[25:15] Spirit to reveal to us the word of
[25:19] God we need the same holy spirit that WR
[25:23] the scripture revealed to us like the
[25:27] time you came
[25:29] in interaction with
[25:31] Christ it was the Holy
[25:34] Spirit that convicted you of your
[25:37] sin and then it's the holy spirit that
[25:41] convinced you that you need to
[25:44] repent and give your life the Lord Jesus
[25:47] Christ so the Holy Ghost has been
[25:50] working upon your
[25:52] life from the time you first heard the
[25:55] word of God it has been the Hest
[25:59] praise the name of our Lord taking you
[26:01] through all the different
[26:04] stages now as the Holy Ghost has been
[26:07] working in your
[26:08] lives to bring you to the knowledge of
[26:11] Christ to bring you to the repentance of
[26:14] your to bring you to live the things you
[26:17] are doing which are not
[26:20] right sanctifying you separating you
[26:24] from the evil
[26:25] ways it is still that same holy
[26:29] spirit that wants to fill your
[26:32] heart praise the name of the lord it's
[26:34] not something that is
[26:36] isolated it is a work that has been
[26:39] continuous in your
[26:40] life and so then you the Bible says that
[26:44] began a good work in
[26:47] us he will bring it to Perfection he
[26:50] will bring it to completion so then you
[26:52] need to allow the same holy
[26:56] spirit that has been moving you
[27:00] praise the name of our Lord you can ask
[27:02] yourself is it your own
[27:05] ability that you are still standing
[27:07] today it's not your own ability but it
[27:11] is the ability of God that has given you
[27:14] by his spirit that you are able to stand
[27:18] and confess the Lord Jesus as your
[27:20] personal
[27:21] Savior by the spirit of God it has been
[27:25] by the spirit of God that you have been
[27:27] able to overcome
[27:29] Temptation it has been by the spirit of
[27:31] God that you've been able to live
[27:34] upright it has been by the spirit of God
[27:37] that end and you're still moving
[27:40] on same confession same
[27:43] confidence same Focus the Lord Jesus
[27:46] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[27:49] don't look at the Holy
[27:50] Ghost as being far away but look at the
[27:54] Holy
[27:55] Ghost as as a a
[28:00] comforter as a
[28:02] companion you know moving along with
[28:06] you teaching you guiding you directing
[28:11] you keeping you encouraging you lifting
[28:15] you up when you are
[28:17] weak praise the name of our Lord that's
[28:20] how you need to look at the Holy
[28:21] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so we
[28:24] see that it was the spirit of
[28:27] God that was teaching us that was
[28:31] guiding us that was instructing Us
[28:35] Praise the name of our now in John
[28:37] chapter
[28:42] 16 and then verse
[28:48] 12 the scripture
[28:50] says I have re many things to say unto
[28:54] you but you cannot bear them
[28:57] now
[29:03] how when he the spirit of Truth is come
[29:07] he will guide you into all Truth for he
[29:10] shall not speak of himself but
[29:13] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[29:16] speak and he will show you things to
[29:27] come
[29:35] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[29:37] of mine and shall show it unto
[29:46] you all things that the father has are
[29:50] mine therefore I said that he will take
[29:53] of mine and will show it unto
[29:57] you
[30:06] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[30:09] when the spirit of Truth is
[30:11] come he will guide us into all
[30:16] truth and then he will
[30:21] speak in other words he will
[30:24] teach he will
[30:26] preach through the word praise the name
[30:30] of our Lord and now when he speaks to us
[30:33] then he will also show
[30:36] us in other words he will reveal to
[30:41] us the things of God it's the spirit of
[30:45] God it's some it's not your
[30:49] understanding but Christ reveals himself
[30:52] to by the Holy Spirit praise the name of
[30:56] our Lord you see the will of God you see
[31:00] the plan of God is that he wants the
[31:03] Holy Spirit to take charge over
[31:06] you praise the name of the Lord you
[31:09] start by hearing the
[31:11] preacher and it's the spirit of God
[31:13] using the
[31:15] preacher and now when you receive
[31:18] it and then it stays in your heart you
[31:21] keep on meditating upon it you keep on
[31:24] cherishing it and then you want to hear
[31:27] more
[31:28] and as you keep on hearing more the
[31:31] spirit keeps on revealing
[31:33] himself and as you keep on
[31:36] obeying then the spirit sanctifies you
[31:40] he separates you from your weaknesses he
[31:43] separates you from sin and as you keep
[31:46] on yielding
[31:47] yourself is washing you is taking away
[31:51] things that are contrary to
[31:54] him he's taking away things that hinder
[31:57] him
[31:59] and then finally the same holy
[32:02] spirit that brought you into
[32:04] justification has taken you through
[32:07] sanctification he now fills you with his
[32:10] own
[32:11] self himself dwelling inside of you so
[32:16] it the work of
[32:18] God the Bible says salvation is of the
[32:22] lord we are saved by grace not of our
[32:27] own works
[32:28] praise the name of our Lord so now if
[32:30] you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your
[32:33] personal
[32:34] savior allow him to take you through all
[32:37] the way just yield yourself to the word
[32:40] of God and then that same word you're
[32:44] yielding will bring you into the image
[32:46] of Jesus Christ will bring the
[32:49] manifestation of the Life of Christ
[32:52] himself right inside of you so now as a
[32:55] Believer or as a person loves God you
[32:59] are called to obey the word of
[33:02] God praise the name of our Lord just say
[33:05] Lord here I am praise the name of our
[33:08] Lord little Samuel he didn't know the
[33:11] voice of God it was not yet revealed to
[33:15] him and then he had the voice Samuel
[33:18] Samuel and he would run to the
[33:21] priest again he had the second time
[33:23] somewh somewhere he R the priest El then
[33:28] knew that it was God speaking to
[33:32] samel praise the name of our Lord you
[33:34] see the
[33:36] beginning of how Samuel started knowing
[33:39] the
[33:40] Lord maybe that's how also we had a
[33:42] beginning with the
[33:44] Lord sometimes not knowing it is the
[33:46] holy
[33:48] spirit speaking to you taking interest
[33:51] in your life Desiring to guide you
[33:55] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[33:57] the book book of
[33:59] Samuel first
[34:03] Samuel praise the name of our
[34:08] Lord first let me get the
[34:15] scripture chapter 3 and then
[34:18] verse
[34:22] 4 the Bible
[34:25] says the Lord called and he
[34:34] answered here am
[34:36] I verse five and he ran unto Eli and
[34:41] said he am I for th callest me and he
[34:44] said I called not lie down again and he
[34:48] went and lay
[34:56] down
[35:02] and the Lord called yet again Samuel and
[35:04] Samuel arose and went to Eli and said
[35:07] here am I for thou did call me and he
[35:10] answered I called not my son lie down
[35:26] again
[35:29] now Samuel did not yet know the
[35:33] Lord and that sometimes also our
[35:37] beginnings that we don't know how the
[35:39] Lord speaks to us we don't know how the
[35:42] spirit teaches
[35:43] us initially you start wondering what is
[35:46] this kind of
[35:48] thing like brother Bram when he would
[35:51] see those Visions it was the Holy Spirit
[35:55] revealing him to himself but then he
[35:58] couldn't know what it was
[36:00] exactly sometimes he would hear the
[36:02] voice do not smoke do not drink do not
[36:06] defile yourself he didn't know that that
[36:08] was the spirit of God but God was taking
[36:12] interest in his
[36:13] life praise the name of our Lord and
[36:16] then God would move him to go to
[36:19] meetings and then he he has the preacher
[36:22] preaching and then he gets concerned he
[36:25] gets
[36:26] convicted that was the beginning the
[36:29] Holy Ghost working upon his life and
[36:32] here also we see that God had started
[36:35] working upon the life
[36:37] of by calling him praise the name of our
[36:41] Lord and each and every one of us has
[36:44] been called by God praise the name of
[36:48] our Lord the first time you had the
[36:50] minister preaching you the gospel that
[36:53] was God calling you praise the name of
[36:56] our Lord Abraham
[36:58] in Genesis 12 the Bible says God called
[37:03] Abraham come out of the land of wool and
[37:06] I show you where you're going praise the
[37:08] name of our Lord look at the Rich Young
[37:11] Ruler when he came to Christ he also had
[37:14] the same
[37:16] calling come and follow
[37:18] me praise the name of our Lord You See
[37:21] It Is God still
[37:23] calling Moses in the before the burning
[37:26] bush it was God revealing himself to
[37:31] Moses calling him come and I send you
[37:36] praise the name of our Lord so Samuel
[37:38] didn't know the voice of
[37:41] God it was not yet revealed to him so
[37:45] the Bible says neither was the word of
[37:48] the Lord yet revealed to
[37:51] him and the Lord called Samuel the third
[37:56] time arose and went to
[37:59] El and said here am
[38:02] I for th did call me and Al perceived
[38:08] that the Lord that called the
[38:11] child therefore told
[38:15] samel go lie down and it shall be if he
[38:20] call thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord
[38:25] for thy servant Heth
[38:28] so went and lay in his
[38:31] place and the Lord came and
[38:35] stood and called us at other
[38:38] times
[38:40] Samuel
[38:43] Samuel then samel
[38:46] answered for the thy
[38:50] servant praise the name of our Lord what
[38:53] an interesting thing it is to know that
[38:56] it is the Lord who has called you praise
[38:59] the name of the Lord what an interesting
[39:01] to know that it was the Holy Spirit that
[39:05] started preaching to the
[39:07] P praise the name of our Lord how so
[39:10] interesting it is that even now it is
[39:13] the spirit of God speaking to us praise
[39:17] the name of our Lord that's how so
[39:19] lovely the Lord is to us so the holy
[39:23] spirit is not far away from you the Holy
[39:26] Ghost has been speaking to you
[39:29] all the only thing that you need is to
[39:32] obey the voice of the Holy Spirit and
[39:35] then what the Holy Ghost has been
[39:37] speaking to you will become manifested
[39:40] in your life praise the name of our Lord
[39:43] that's how simple it is if you know that
[39:46] is the holy spirit then obey the Holy
[39:49] Ghost and then the Holy Ghost will
[39:51] perform his
[39:53] purpose in your life it's not something
[39:57] difficult
[39:58] that's why the Bible says he that has my
[40:03] wife and does it it is he that love me
[40:09] and he that loveth me I will come and
[40:13] make my in him that's what the Holy
[40:16] Ghost is saying hear his word obey his
[40:20] word and he comes into your heart he
[40:23] settles into your heart praise the name
[40:26] of our Lord it's not difficult to
[40:29] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[40:32] it is as simple as that he the spirit
[40:37] the spirit and the spirit comes down
[40:40] praise the name of our Lord so that's
[40:41] what we see Samuel here he did not the
[40:44] voice initially but now when it was
[40:47] revealed to him that it was the Lord he
[40:51] said Lord
[40:52] speak praise the name of our Lord and
[40:54] now we also need to hear the voice of
[40:56] the spirit
[40:58] we need to hear the word of God why does
[41:02] the word of God speak why does the word
[41:05] of God teach
[41:06] us praise the name of our Lord now in
[41:09] the message the church
[41:15] age he says the evidence is
[41:22] hearing what the spirit
[41:25] says the spirit is is
[41:29] talking yes the spirit is
[41:33] teaching how does the spirit talk how
[41:36] does the spirit teach it uses through
[41:39] the
[41:40] ministers it teaches us through the
[41:43] scriptures through the TS when you take
[41:46] your time and then you meditate upon the
[41:49] word the word of God it is the spirit of
[41:53] God that speaks to you then he says that
[41:57] is exactly what Jesus
[42:00] said that he would do when he
[42:03] came John
[42:06] 1426 he will teach you all
[42:10] things and bring all things to your
[42:14] reme whatsoever I have said unto
[42:17] you and that is just what
[42:22] happen that is how the
[42:25] gospels were written
[42:28] these men had recalled to their minds by
[42:31] the Holy
[42:33] Ghost the very words that Jesus
[42:37] spoke that's why the
[42:39] gospels are
[42:43] accurate they are
[42:45] perfect but the spirit did not only
[42:49] bring all things to their
[42:54] mind but he told them
[42:58] father on the truth they already
[43:01] had that's how Paul received his
[43:05] Revelation he said concerning
[43:08] it but I certify you
[43:11] Brethren that the gospel which was
[43:13] preached of me is not after
[43:17] man for I never received it of
[43:21] man neither was I taught it of
[43:25] man but by the Revel
[43:27] of Jesus
[43:29] Christ and any
[43:32] Revelation comes by the spirit of God
[43:36] the revelation of God comes by the
[43:39] spirit of God it's the spirit of God
[43:43] revealing and when the spirit of God
[43:46] reveals to
[43:47] you then you get
[43:50] Faith praise the name of the Lord you
[43:53] get that Faith you catch that revelation
[43:57] praise the name of our Lord and then
[43:59] when you get that
[44:01] Revelation the gates of hell can never
[44:03] Prevail
[44:05] against praise the name of our Lord It's
[44:08] the Lord speaking to you it's the Lord
[44:10] teaching you it's the Lord showing you
[44:15] himself and that's how we need to desire
[44:17] every day Lord reveal yourself Lord show
[44:21] me the path I need to take Lord direct
[44:25] me praise the name of our Lord
[44:27] then he says he was taught by the Holy
[44:31] Ghost one day when Jesus was upon the
[44:35] earth a certain important man came to
[44:38] visit
[44:39] him this man said
[44:43] Rabbi we know you are a teacher sent
[44:45] from
[44:47] God but you will
[44:49] notice that Jesus cut him
[44:52] short he turned to
[44:55] Nicodemus and the words he spoke May
[44:58] well be paraphrased
[45:04] th I am not a
[45:07] teacher I am the sacrificial lamb for
[45:13] sin I am making possible the New
[45:17] Birth by my
[45:19] spirit but there is coming one who is
[45:23] the
[45:25] teacher he is down Holy
[45:29] Spirit praise the name of the Lord so he
[45:31] first teaches us he first preaches to us
[45:36] the Bible says how would they believe if
[45:40] there is no preacher so the Holy Ghost
[45:43] anoints a preacher and then the preacher
[45:46] comes and preaches and now when the
[45:49] preacher preaches you believe it you
[45:52] obey it then the Holy Ghost comes and
[45:55] fills you praise the name of our Lord
[45:58] Cornelius was
[46:00] praying but it took the angel to come
[46:03] down to give guidance to
[46:06] conari called for
[46:08] Peter and he sent men to call Peter and
[46:12] now when Peter came he said why have you
[46:14] called for
[46:16] me said you know the angel came 3 days
[46:19] ago told me to call for you and then
[46:22] Peter started preaching the Lord Jesus
[46:25] Christ the name of our Lord and if you
[46:28] have heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[46:31] the Bible says it's the power of God
[46:34] unto
[46:36] salvation the Gospel of Jesus Christ so
[46:39] the more you hear the gospel and you
[46:41] obey the gospel then you are receiving
[46:44] the power of God praise the name of our
[46:47] Lord the Holy Ghost keeps on coming down
[46:50] theh keeps on coming down in your heart
[46:53] praise the name of our Lord and the
[46:55] Bible says in Acts chapter 10
[46:57] when Peter spoke these
[47:00] words the Holy Ghost fell on them the
[47:04] that's the same principle even
[47:06] now the Holy Ghost did not
[47:10] fall to any person in the new in in the
[47:14] book of
[47:16] Acts without first hearing the
[47:20] word the Holy Ghost speaks to you
[47:24] first so you believe him you accept him
[47:29] you re you welcome him come Holy Spirit
[47:34] then he comes down in your life praise
[47:36] the name of our lord it's not
[47:38] difficult praise the name of our Lord so
[47:41] he says Nicodemus was looking at the
[47:44] teacher but he said I'm the lamb
[47:47] sacrificed for
[47:48] sin I need to die for the
[47:52] sins and now when I die for the sins
[47:56] then my life will come back in the form
[47:58] of the Holy
[47:59] Ghost and will give you the new
[48:03] birth praise the name of
[48:05] our when Jesus was upon us he came as
[48:10] the
[48:11] lamb and as the prophet but when he come
[48:15] back upon the
[48:17] church by his Spirit he became the
[48:22] teacher praise the name of our Lord so
[48:25] do we have the teacher now
[48:28] praise the name of our Lord we have the
[48:30] teacher and the teacher is the Holy
[48:33] Ghost and now the Holy Ghost uses the
[48:37] ministers the Holy Ghost uses the
[48:41] scriptures the Holy Ghost uses the TPS
[48:44] of the message and likewise the Holy
[48:47] Ghost Inside of us teaches us every day
[48:52] praise the name of our Lord we need to
[48:54] have the inside
[48:55] teacher living within us teaching us
[49:00] guiding us directing us revealing
[49:03] himself to us praise the name of our
[49:06] Lord you need the inside teacher and the
[49:09] inside teacher is the Holy Ghost and the
[49:13] inside teacher is not far away from you
[49:17] praise the name of our Lord he has been
[49:19] teaching you one step at a time taking
[49:23] you through
[49:24] justification taking you through
[49:26] sanctification
[49:27] until he feels himself where he feels
[49:30] I'm comfortable now Towell in this
[49:35] praise the name of our Lord allow the
[49:37] Holy Ghost to take over all your life
[49:41] praise the name of our Lord and then he
[49:43] says un to every
[49:45] age we hear the same
[49:49] truth he that has an ear let him hear
[49:53] what the spirit says to the church
[49:57] but only a spirit filled
[50:00] man can hear the Revelation for that
[50:05] age none other can no sir they
[50:11] cannot because that is exactly what Paul
[50:14] said in First
[50:18] Corinthians chapter 2: 6 to verse
[50:22] 16 praise the name of our Lord I want us
[50:25] again to go another
[50:27] quot he says he told
[50:31] us the
[50:33] evidence of what would happen after
[50:36] being baptized with the Holy
[50:38] Ghost was that he would have the the
[50:43] teacher
[50:45] come and teach all
[50:49] truth but that
[50:52] teacher was an inside
[50:55] teacher not and outside
[50:58] teacher if the spirit wasn't
[51:01] inside you wouldn't hear the truth and
[51:05] receive it by
[51:07] Revelation if you had it every moment of
[51:10] the
[51:11] day that was the sign of the ining
[51:17] spirit in the days of
[51:20] Paul those who were filled with the Holy
[51:24] Ghost heard the word
[51:27] received it and lived by
[51:30] it those who did not have the
[51:34] spirit had it as car
[51:38] men put a wrong interpretation on
[51:42] it and went into sin in every age and
[51:47] every age is the age of the Holy
[51:51] Ghost to the True
[51:53] Believer I say in every age the evidence
[51:57] was the
[51:58] same those who had the
[52:01] spirit the
[52:03] teacher had the
[52:05] word and the spirit in them took the
[52:10] word and told it revealed to them and
[52:16] they were of the
[52:18] group that had the
[52:21] messenger and his message and took
[52:25] it and lived
[52:27] it praise the name of our Lord so then
[52:31] you need to hear the spirit
[52:35] teaching and you know the spirit teaches
[52:37] us in various
[52:40] ways you hear the word and then the
[52:43] spirit can take you through some kind of
[52:49] Trials praise the name of our Lord can
[52:51] take you through some
[52:54] chastisement is doing child
[52:57] training praise the name of our Lord
[53:00] ising
[53:01] you praise the name of our Lord he
[53:04] teaching you you know like brother talks
[53:07] about the
[53:09] tutor he says the Holy Ghost he comes
[53:13] and checks you and then he reports back
[53:17] ah this son doesn't want your
[53:20] instruction son doesn't want to do this
[53:24] because the Holy Ghost has been teaching
[53:27] is directing you but when he tells you
[53:29] this do you do it praise the name of our
[53:33] Lord so he keeps on making a report
[53:35] about your
[53:38] conduct about how you hid the word about
[53:42] how serious you are with the word he
[53:44] keeps on giving a report and now if you
[53:48] can obey the Holy
[53:50] Ghost then you are
[53:53] sealed till the day of redemption prise
[53:56] the name of our Lord so the Holy Ghost
[53:59] is already working Upon Our Lives we
[54:01] only need to say Lord like somewhere
[54:05] Here I Am Lord direct me Lord guide me
[54:09] Lord every day that we live we need to
[54:12] live to seek the face of the Lord Lord
[54:15] lead me every step every time every hour
[54:21] praise the name of our Lord so we are
[54:23] not talking about the Holy Spirit praise
[54:27] the name of the Lord which you can only
[54:29] go to a convention and
[54:31] receive no praise the name of the Lord
[54:34] we're not talking about the Holy
[54:37] Ghost which you can only maybe say
[54:39] there's some special man with the Holy
[54:43] Ghost we not talking about
[54:45] that as the true word of God is
[54:48] ministered to
[54:50] you and you can obey the word of God is
[54:54] the holy spirit himself
[54:57] Desiring to dwell in your
[54:59] life praise the name of our Lord that's
[55:01] how easy it
[55:02] is obey the word and the spirit fills
[55:07] you and even when the spirit fills you
[55:10] he still wants to work upon
[55:12] your he wants you to
[55:15] grow praise the name of our Lord and
[55:17] reach
[55:19] adoption and reach the state of a
[55:22] perfect
[55:23] man and be able to demonstrate the image
[55:26] of Jesus
[55:27] Christ so the Holy Ghost right now is
[55:31] our inside
[55:33] teacher he teaches us he guides us he
[55:37] directs Us Praise the name of our Lord
[55:41] he speak to us the word of God he
[55:43] reveals us the word of God we only need
[55:46] to yield to the spirit
[55:48] of praise the name of our that even the
[55:51] Holy Ghost when he has dwelt in
[55:55] you the name of our Lord the Bible says
[55:59] it's no longer you that
[56:02] speak but the Holy Ghost wants to use
[56:06] you to
[56:07] speak praise the name of our Lord let us
[56:11] go to MTH chapter
[56:14] 10 and then
[56:20] verse 10
[56:25] verse the scripture
[56:29] says but when they deliver you up take
[56:32] no thought how or what you shall speak
[56:35] for it shall be given you in the same
[56:38] hour what you shall
[56:54] speak for it is not ye that speak but
[56:58] the spirit of your father which speaketh
[57:01] in
[57:08] you so when the Holy Ghost is right
[57:11] inside of
[57:12] you and then you are put under
[57:15] circumstances you don't
[57:17] understand sitations you don't
[57:19] understand before accusers or before
[57:25] critics know
[57:28] or before
[57:29] authorities he says don't think what
[57:31] you're going to speak but the spirit of
[57:34] God will come and speak the right
[57:38] words praise the name of our Lord so he
[57:41] once he dwells in
[57:43] you he will tell you what to
[57:46] say praise the name of our Lord he will
[57:49] show you what to do praise the name of
[57:53] our Lord he will reveal himself to you
[57:57] look at Peter when he was released from
[58:00] prison the holy the Holy
[58:03] Spirit you know sent an
[58:05] angel and then the angel started guiding
[58:08] him directing him and teaching him and
[58:12] say you go and show yourself to these
[58:15] people praise the name of our Lord so it
[58:18] was no longer his
[58:20] mind God had taken over the mind of
[58:25] Peter was leading him was directing him
[58:30] and now we need God to take over our
[58:33] mind to Peter I thought was a
[58:36] dream but it was God himself moving
[58:41] him something that man could not
[58:44] do prise the name of our and so we need
[58:47] to allow the Holy
[58:49] Ghost to take over our lives to fully
[58:53] take over our lives to govern Our Lives
[58:57] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[59:00] First Corinthians chapter
[59:03] 2 First Corinthians chapter
[59:07] 2 and then read in verse
[59:12] 10 it
[59:20] says but God has revealed them to us by
[59:25] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[59:28] things yeah the Deep things of
[59:47] God praise the name of the Lord so the
[59:49] Bible
[59:50] says God reveals to us the Deep
[59:55] things
[59:57] and he reveals them to
[59:59] us by his
[1:00:02] Spirit the spirit sear as all
[1:00:07] things the spirit suchar as the Deep
[1:00:09] things of
[1:00:11] God and you know one thing about how the
[1:00:13] spirit speaks to
[1:00:16] us he can even search us when we are
[1:00:18] sited here in
[1:00:20] church he goes to this corner such as
[1:00:23] this heart pulls out something goes in
[1:00:26] another Corner such as the other pulls
[1:00:29] out something then goes to another
[1:00:31] corner like when brother Bram was under
[1:00:33] the
[1:00:34] anointing maybe it was a prayer line
[1:00:37] before him and so the Holy Ghost would
[1:00:39] come upon the person and reveals that
[1:00:42] person and from that person the Holy
[1:00:45] Ghost goes in another corner and again
[1:00:48] he attracts the attention say this and
[1:00:50] this then the Holy Ghost can move from
[1:00:53] that corner come to the front part talk
[1:00:56] to another person another Corner the
[1:00:59] Holy Ghost
[1:01:00] searching and we need to allow the Holy
[1:01:03] Ghost also to search our
[1:01:05] heart search me oh Lord praise the name
[1:01:09] of our
[1:01:10] Lord praise the name of our Lord that
[1:01:13] you can be searched
[1:01:15] out and then he can tell you
[1:01:17] now praise the name of our Lord I'm
[1:01:21] comfortable I'm well pleased to dwell in
[1:01:25] you
[1:01:26] because he has searched you and there's
[1:01:29] nothing contrary to
[1:01:31] him there's nothing you know no
[1:01:34] rebellious
[1:01:38] Spirits praise the name of our but you
[1:01:40] are all obedient to the
[1:01:42] word so we need to allow the Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] to search us every day and say Lord lead
[1:01:50] me like David the Bible says Try Me Oh
[1:01:54] Lord
[1:01:57] praise the name of our Lord then he says
[1:01:59] for what man knoweth the things of man
[1:02:01] sa the spirit of man which is in him
[1:02:04] even so the things of God knows no man
[1:02:07] but the spirit of
[1:02:21] God praise the name of the Lord says
[1:02:25] nobody
[1:02:27] knows the things of
[1:02:29] God save the spirit of
[1:02:33] God so when the spirit of God is in
[1:02:36] us he reveals to us the things of God he
[1:02:40] he teaches us the things of God he is
[1:02:43] the inside
[1:02:45] teacher when you get to read your
[1:02:47] message
[1:02:48] books the Holy Ghost starts revealing
[1:02:51] things to you reminding you of this kind
[1:02:54] of things
[1:02:56] and you know like sometimes when you are
[1:02:57] reading a message
[1:02:59] book you can even take a whole day on
[1:03:02] two three
[1:03:04] pages because there are many things the
[1:03:06] Holy Ghost is speaking
[1:03:09] up praise the name of our Lord you can
[1:03:12] read one or two scriptures and it is so
[1:03:15] much expounded before
[1:03:17] you praise the name of the Lord
[1:03:19] revealing these
[1:03:21] things praise the name of our Lord so
[1:03:23] when you read the word the word of God
[1:03:26] take time and meditate upon it take time
[1:03:30] and you know think about
[1:03:32] it praise the name of you know even
[1:03:35] these po do social sciences or whatever
[1:03:38] science they
[1:03:40] do then they they are now training
[1:03:44] people that you do some
[1:03:48] yoga and then you sit there and start
[1:03:51] meditating go in nature and start
[1:03:54] thinking and then they say is very
[1:03:57] healthy and then it refreshes you it
[1:04:01] brings you peace see the devil is
[1:04:03] copying what the Lord tells us to
[1:04:06] do but for them they're not meditating
[1:04:08] upon the word of God it's just something
[1:04:12] else you know but now here we have the
[1:04:15] word of God take time and meditate upon
[1:04:18] this word take time and think about the
[1:04:21] word of God praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:27] read the word think about the word
[1:04:29] meditate upon the word and then what you
[1:04:32] have
[1:04:34] read let it stick in your
[1:04:37] memory let it stick in Your
[1:04:40] Heart praise the name of our Lord and
[1:04:43] when it comes to time to
[1:04:46] do obey it do it the Bible
[1:04:51] says happy are
[1:04:54] you okay we can again pick that
[1:04:56] scripture in John Chapter
[1:05:02] 13 and verse
[1:05:05] 17 he says if you know these
[1:05:10] things happy are you if you do
[1:05:15] them that's the way it works the Holy
[1:05:18] Ghost has revealed these things to
[1:05:20] you you are more blessed to do
[1:05:23] them because you get the portion of
[1:05:26] these things you become part of them you
[1:05:30] have known them and for to be part of
[1:05:33] them obey
[1:05:35] them praise the name of the Lord that's
[1:05:38] how it works and then you'll see the
[1:05:40] Life of
[1:05:41] Christ being manifested in you so you
[1:05:45] don't only stop at being
[1:05:48] taught but then you have to be in
[1:05:51] demonstration of
[1:05:54] what the life of
[1:05:57] it that proves you have been taught by
[1:05:59] the holy spirit that means it has been
[1:06:02] revealed to
[1:06:04] you praise the name of our Lord when God
[1:06:07] called Abraham leave this country go to
[1:06:11] another country Abraham obeyed and when
[1:06:15] he obeyed he became part of that
[1:06:18] promise and that's the same thing we
[1:06:20] also need to do is God has revealed
[1:06:23] these things to us let us obey
[1:06:26] and when we obey them they become part
[1:06:28] of Us Praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:06:32] go back to First Corinthians chapter
[1:06:35] 2 and verse
[1:06:38] 12 now we have received not the spirit
[1:06:41] of the world but the spirit which is of
[1:06:43] god that we might know the things that
[1:06:46] are freely given to us of
[1:06:54] God
[1:07:01] which things also we speak not in The
[1:07:05] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[1:07:08] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[1:07:12] spiritual with spiritual
[1:07:24] things
[1:07:27] so it's the holy ghost that teaches
[1:07:31] us it's the holy ghost that reveals to
[1:07:35] us the holy ghost that directs Us Praise
[1:07:40] the name of the
[1:07:41] Lord just in finishing
[1:07:44] again the Holy Spirit started working
[1:07:49] upon your
[1:07:50] life the time you had the gospel the
[1:07:53] first
[1:07:54] time and then the Holy Ghost convicted
[1:07:58] you and when the Holy Ghost convicted
[1:08:01] you you said Lord forgive me Lord
[1:08:04] Deliver Me Lord I Repent of that I've
[1:08:08] done it was the Holy Spirit working upon
[1:08:12] your life and then you kept on coming to
[1:08:15] Services of the Lord you kept on reading
[1:08:18] the word of God you kept on Desiring to
[1:08:21] hear the word of God what was you had a
[1:08:24] desire to hear the spirit was speaking
[1:08:26] to
[1:08:28] you and the Holy Ghost was instructing
[1:08:32] you praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:08:35] the Holy
[1:08:36] Spirit started sanctifying you because
[1:08:40] it is the holy spirit that justifies Us
[1:08:44] Praise the name of our Lord It's the
[1:08:46] holy ghost that comes and sanctifies Us
[1:08:50] by the preaching of the word then the
[1:08:52] Holy Ghost justifies you by preaching
[1:08:57] and you believing the word you are
[1:08:59] justified by the spirit of God and again
[1:09:02] the Holy Ghost sanctifies you by the
[1:09:06] word praise the name of the Lord the
[1:09:09] Lord Jesus said the words that I speak
[1:09:11] unto you spirit and
[1:09:15] Truth praise the name of the Lord so
[1:09:18] when you hear the word of God you are
[1:09:20] hearing the spirit
[1:09:22] speaking so when you obey the word you
[1:09:25] obeying the Holy Spirit and as you keep
[1:09:28] on obeying the Holy Ghost then the
[1:09:30] spirit himself who has justify you who
[1:09:35] sanctifying you FS you
[1:09:38] himself so the Holy Ghost is not
[1:09:41] far but he's right with you and he wants
[1:09:45] to take full charge over your
[1:09:47] life the more you obey the word is the
