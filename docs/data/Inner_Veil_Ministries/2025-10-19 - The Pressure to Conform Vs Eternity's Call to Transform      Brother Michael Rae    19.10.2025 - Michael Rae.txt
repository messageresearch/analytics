[Music] Now I shout the victory for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe it? Are you free tonight? I was just sitting there in the seat and seeing everybody come to the front, all the pastors and and the song that that Tom quoted this morning said, "My eyes have seen the glory." And I thought, my I think my eyes are seeing the glory. I just feel like I need to sing that verse and the chorus before we start. You know that song? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. What key is that song in?

Thank you, brother Steven, Butter James, forc allowing us to be here. &gt;&gt; Do you have to forgive me? &gt;&gt; I know you might have been expecting my dad. [Music] You just got the mini Tom tonight. [Music] I'm just giving I just letting dad get his strength back. Amen. Because I I know this morning you had a whole lot of food, spiritual food presented to you and you were eating this morning. What do you say? How do you say you Where did you steal it? Where where did you steal that word? Well, from you probably. [Applause] So, you're probably really full, but tonight maybe just a little cherry, just a little extra tonight. So don't tell the Lord tonight. You can say, "Lord, I need a little more." Then you can say, "I want you." Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. See, a little bit of Uganda, sorry. A little bit of Uganda was put inside me [Applause] for to be depositing yourselves into me. [Music] Amen. So then I, you know, I went in, you know, when brother Brandon speaks about going into the water and then he says, "Come in the water." [Music] &gt;&gt; So I had to go and get my dad. The water's hot. Amen. So it's just a privilege to be back to be back. Glory. &gt;&gt; Are we ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles. &gt;&gt; We're going to Romans 12. I have to make a little correction. I'm not correcting my dad, but I'm brother Tom's son. &gt;&gt; Not brother Tom is my dad. I &gt;&gt; I'm Brother Tom's son. &gt;&gt; That's how we'll introduce them. Amen. Amen. And I'm sure proud that he's my father. and the same fire that burns in him burns in me. &gt;&gt; Not just natural genes, natural genes. &gt;&gt; Let's read in Romans 12 verse one. very familiar scripture says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two says, "And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. [Music] Amen. Be not conformed to this world. But be ye transformed. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just bow our heads for a moment of prayer? Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, tonight we are so desirous Lord that you come one more time Lord. We fed upon your word this morning, Lord. And as it's as we indeed the stimulation of your presence, Lord, lifted your people, Lord, strengthened them, nourish them. Lord, tonight we're just asking, you come just one more time, Lord. Somebody's heart is craving. Their soul is yearning. And Lord, just one word. Lord, when you speak one word, Lord, lives are completely changed. Lord, would you transform us tonight by the word of this hour? We commit the service to you now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may have your seat. Can I take my coat off right away? &gt;&gt; I need to uh relax a little bit if I can. Yeah, brother Emanuel, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Emanuel has a special spot in my heart. [Music] He was my very first translator. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we had a good time. &gt;&gt; I had to learn to slow down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Scripture says, "Be not conformed to this world." &gt;&gt; And if I could maybe title tonight's service, if I could say it's the pressure to conform versus eternity's call to transform. Because one thing is certain in this age is we're under pressure. This age is filled with pressure to bend you &gt;&gt; and to bend me and conform us to the social aspects or the social desires of this day. [Music] to define. I want to just I'm going to take the beginning a little bit slower because conform &gt;&gt; means to be in agreement with to conform is to be in harmony with something or obedient or compliant. It's to conform to something. It's for somebody to align themselves, your attitude, your belief, your behavior with the people around you. Okay? So human nature, we're kind of programmed to conform. We all want to be accepted. The human being desires acceptance. And so society throughout time has conformed to new ideas all through time. To give you an example, you know, in the middle ages, many hundreds of years ago, you know, everybody the the face, the forehead was the very central part of the body. &gt;&gt; And and they they they liked they they thought that that need to be um the focus. So they plucked their eyelashes [Music] and their eyebrow so that it would all just be smooth face because the idea was that was beautiful then. So soc society bent accepted the idea that that was a good thing to do in China if you would if you know there in the older days they would wrap their feet the ladies would wrap their feet &gt;&gt; the ladies &gt;&gt; oh so that you could marry early. Somehow they felt that if you you you wrapped your feet so they couldn't grow that that was a big deal. [Music] So all the ladies are wrapping their feet So they were conforming to the idea of the age and bending their belief to the pressure of that time. You see that all through history. You see it through wars. [Music] they actually call it the Lucifer effect because when somebody is in authority and they say hey do this it's okay you go do that person listens to the person in authority &gt;&gt; and just wants to conform and believes that what he's saying is okay. And they did that in World War II. Hitler says, [Music] Hitler said, "Take the Jews, go kill them." So the soldiers believed the authority that it was okay to do that. and they conformed to his will and they call that the Lucifer effect. And so humanity has a desire. If everybody's doing it, it's okay. You know, I can do that, too. you know, we don't want to have a negative social impact. [Music] I want to belong to a group. And so then people conform. Remember, scripture says, "Be not conformed to this world, &gt;&gt; but the norms of culture. It es and it flows. It changes with the tides of man to where it comes to a place. Where who's right? Is he right? Is he right? Who's right? I'm right. &gt;&gt; I do what I want to do. So everybody does their own thing and and people then be they don't have no tie post. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nature proclaims there must be an absolute. &gt;&gt; There must be an absolute apost that you can go to. Not his idea, &gt;&gt; not his idea. &gt;&gt; That idea, &gt;&gt; but this idea, nature proclaims it because in the stars is a north star that stays in position. It doesn't drift with the night sky. It doesn't move with the seasons, but it stays constant. No matter where you are, you can look to the north star. You know your direction. Amen. But humanity has thrown away the compass. They've thrown away the compass and now they're wandering stars. But Abraham says, "Anything contrary to the word." &gt;&gt; He says, "Let me tell you something. This is the complete &gt;&gt; the complete divine revelation of God, &gt;&gt; his will and the coming of Christ and everything right in this book. He says, "If anything draws you off, throw that compass away. If anything takes you off this, moves you to some other man's idea, this remains true. I'm sorry, but if your compass is religion, you're going to be off track. And you can have religion right in the message. If I just believe the message, brother Michael. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; If I just believe the message, &gt;&gt; you can be your one man denomination in the message. Cuz the moment you inject one thought that deviates from the word of God, you denominated and hybrid. this word. We don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; So, it's not just enough to say, I believe the message, &gt;&gt; Lord, I need to believe in me. Brother Abraham says &gt;&gt; if you're if it's only a paper that you're packing in your pocket [Music] talking about some creed, some idea, some dogma. He said, "Find the compass that sets you to the word. Can I just say this tonight? Show me a religion. Show me Buddhists, Hindus, &gt;&gt; Sikhs, Muslims, Catholics, some other religion that can display a living word. None of their religions point to a living God. story. But the Catholic system, they don't point you to a living God. They point to a dead god. They point to a tomb, but they can't point you to a living God that you heard this morning, a present God. They point you to some saint here or some saint there, but there's saints right here that are living with a message. [Applause] We've seen over you've seen over and over again. God has displayed himself in your midst. [Music] You've seen him displayed. You've seen God come down. You can't deny a living God. And if you need some more proof, show me another Bible that over 4,000 plus years from the beginning here. It was written here and written over 4,000 years. Every prophecy was fulfilled in Christ. You show me another book. Show me another scripture. Back in Adam's time, time in prophe prophecy, men that were burst. You think it's coincidence that Moses was a type of Christ? You think it's a coincidence that Joseph, every aspect of Joseph's life can convey the very image of Christ? No, it's not. It's divine order of God to you that this word is true. There's no other book. There's no other pamphlet. There's no other creed that can prove that he came today. Every type and shadow You go through the tabernacle, how it was, how everything was placed, the showbread, the sacrifice, the goat, the scapegoat, the lamb, everything lines perfectly and represents Jesus Christ in every detail. Show me some other religion that can prove itself like that. I'll save you the time. There is none. This alone is your compass. This alone Show me another God that can take a wretched sinner and change them into a new creature. Hallelujah. [Music] Why? Because religion conforms and it can take a man or a woman. It will bend them to conform a doctrine. This message transforms and can take a wretched sinner. It can take someone like me that was raised in a good home, &gt;&gt; but can reveal the word of this house and bring me to the recognition that I too need a savior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. sinner. We're all born in sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Music] [Applause] Amen. That's what brother Tom can say this morning. It's the same God that can deliver and can keep. He does it all. That's my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "If I die in my tracks, if I die right here, right now, my absolute &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "If everybody," &gt;&gt; someone said, "Billy, you preach such things as that, &gt;&gt; you're going to preach to the post of the church. Brother said, "I'll be preaching God's word to the post then because God is able of these posts to raise up children of Abraham. My God is more than able to pastor. Youth ministers and pastors preach the pure word. It don't matter who's in your church. If it's the two people, God will raise up a church. &gt;&gt; As you heard this morning, God cares about his seed. Two, 10,000. The word draws them in. Amen. [Applause] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; Dr. Davis said to brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; he says, "You think they're going to believe you?" Brother Brandham said, "It's not my business. [Music] It's my business to stay true to the word. It's not my business to worry about who believes in what? It's your business to stay true to God. Why? So that truth truth can march on. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Michael. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Mike. &gt;&gt; I'm a nonconformist. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't care what people say this way or not. I have my own idea. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then you just put yourself in the judges. But Abrandom said, "Every man done right in his own sight." Not a good place to be. He says, "The reason they did that judges." He said, "This might shock you just a little bit, but he said the reason they did it because they had no prophet in them days for the word of the Lord to come to there was no prophet." because you heard this morning. The word is revealed to his servants. So they didn't have a prophet. So they just did what they thought was right. He said, "And that's exactly what's happened today." I want you to recognize the date here. And this will just tie into this morning. [Music] 62 62 &gt;&gt; 1962 December 30th [Music] &gt;&gt; he's rolling into 63 [Music] in 62. But Abraham says we don't have the prophet in these days of denomination but God promised us one. He would rise up and send Elijah back on the scene and turn the hearts back &gt;&gt; to the father. And the word in 63 was going to begin the unveiling. &gt;&gt; The prophet was there. God was setting it up. vindicating &gt;&gt; so that you and me have no question. &gt;&gt; So when the word was open and he started to reveal the the the message of this hour and his seals to be loose. God had spent time vindicating. So when it came, you could say it's all true. It's all true. I can believe it. I can believe those mysteries being God stepped behind him, year, year after year, &gt;&gt; so that you don't have a question. prophet has to come whether you like it or not. &gt;&gt; No one liked Elijah. &gt;&gt; No one like Micaiah. &gt;&gt; No one like Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; No one liked Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Amos. You name it. Tell me one prophet in scripture that the the that this that the the humanity didn't hate. Ahab, come on, Micaiah. Why are you speaking evil things of me all the time? Tell me good things. All these prophets tell me good things. But where would you want to stand? &gt;&gt; I want to stand beside Mia. &gt;&gt; I want to stand beside Isaiah. I want to stand beside Jeremiah cried out and said destruction come repent of your sin. Sorry, &gt;&gt; repent of your sins. Jeremiah, our prophet has said we're going to crush them. In fact, I've got a yoke of iron. What do you believe? History says, &gt;&gt; "I want to stand with a minority. &gt;&gt; I want to stand with a prophet that stood alone." &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised when in this day and age, the enemy comes in like a flood against the word of this house. It's just scripture. be comforted. It's scriptural. [Music] And &gt;&gt; so, a word came to awaken us from the sliding away or the conforming away from the word. You know, it isn't news to you that biblical truths of scripture that were once normal are now labeled old-fashioned or even outlawed. [Music] It was normal that women wore dresses and modesty. It was normal. But the world is out to conform you. So the new normal is provided. And you see every sort of dress, but scripture said, "A woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man. Neither shall a man put on a woman. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I come from a country that is so perverted that it's normal for a man to put on a woman's garment. You chuckle, you laugh, but that's Vancouver. And in God's eyes, &gt;&gt; it's an abomination. &gt;&gt; It's wretched. &gt;&gt; And you as men would see a man dressed like a woman and you would want to wretch. God wants to wretch. &gt;&gt; You know what? When a woman puts on man's garments, God still wants to wretch. &gt;&gt; It's the same. It's the same. It hasn't changed, &gt;&gt; but the world has changed. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Okay, the rest of the world's doing it. Young people, you got so much pressure that you align with the world's social norms. Your language, &gt;&gt; how you talk, how you act, makeup and fashion, all these aspects that pressure you. [Music] You get on your phone You're going through all your social media and it's pressure. Pressure pressure. I got to be like that person. I got to be like that. I want to fit in. I don't want to be I don't want to be scorned. I don't want to be mocked. Pressure. Amen. I could go through scripture whether it's headship headship the proper order of the home, &gt;&gt; the order of the home [Music] or the relationship of a marriage &gt;&gt; or even down to this down to even gender there. Brother Brandham says it's perversion. I'm going to read you a quote from 1965. This is 1965. That's a long time ago. &gt;&gt; You would say that's oldfashioned times. &gt;&gt; He says human perversion. Women don't even know what sex they belong to. Uganda. Amen. 1965. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine sitting right here in that service? It would curl your hair if it was straight. And if your hair was curly, it would go straight. You'd say, "We're in 1965. We got perfect family." unit, but a prophet with eyes to see our so that you &gt;&gt; would not conform to this world's ideas. Bringing the scripture to life in this day. What confidence you can have to know that God saw this hour. You can read that message. &gt;&gt; And you're not saying, "Oh, that's old time." You're like, "That's right now." Right now. [Applause] So then I wonder maybe the question needs to be asked, have my norms been altered? You're under extreme pressure of an age and you're and the pressure is starting to build. [Music] It s forces you to buckle. because that's what pressure will do. Couple years ago, there was an expedition to the Titanic. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe you heard it in the news. I don't know. But a small group of people &gt;&gt; went into a submersible machine and they wanted to go down to the Titanic and that about two and a half miles deep. Maybe that's like four plus kilometers. The pressure got so great. They say &gt;&gt; that that pressure at 4 km under the water is equal to 35 elephants on your back. So, can you can you imagine standing right here and somebody took an elephant on my back? Do you know what would happen to me? I'd be about that thin and then another elephant. And another elephant, another elephant. 35, &gt;&gt; but there was a crack. There was a malfunction and it couldn't handle the pressure and the whole thing blew in a moment. Everything in that submarine gone. I want to tell you this evening, &gt;&gt; the pressure that Satan's putting on you is greater greater than 35 elephants. the pressure of this world pressing you and you go through maybe circumstances. You go through a situation. Young people, you go to school and the peer pressure along with the crowd and Satan's pressing and you like, I don't know if I can take it. It's too much for me. &gt;&gt; I'm buckling and some explode. Sometimes even inside church there's a pressure &gt;&gt; to conform to the acceptable &gt;&gt; atmosphere. [Music] Someone comes into church. &gt;&gt; This is where your friends are. This is where your family is. You clap. &gt;&gt; We sing. &gt;&gt; Everyone else does. &gt;&gt; You know, we come to church on Sunday. &gt;&gt; I don't go to the parties. You don't you know, you don't you do. &gt;&gt; It's rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; I do all that. &gt;&gt; Rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Oh. And because of the external pressure, [Music] you just conform to the atmosphere, but not a transform. You will just walk through life, but something will come and Satan will start the pray. And at some point, maybe it's a mental break. Marriage breaks. They'll leave the message. We've seen people, they break, they leave and leave and don't even believe God anymore because the pressure to conform. They conformed to a message. They conformed to just religiosity. If Satan comes and he wants to put the pressure on, find the area to break them. It's dangerous &gt;&gt; to live in a conforming. [Music] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you there's a greater power. [Music] There is a greater power for because scripture said Be ye not conformed to the things of this world, but there's something greater than that. Because if I can transform, if I can deposit something inside of you, all the pressure is exerted on you. Something inside you pushes out It's called a light. The word inside you is greater than the pressure to conform. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] But it requires &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; It requires a renewing of the mind. a fire to burn because it's an inside process, not something just on the outside, not just a following rules, just following my family. Fire that can renew your mind so that no matter who's around you, You follow the word every single time. [Applause] [Applause] Not a filtered mind where the word gets spoken and you're like, "Well, that's a little strong. I don't know if I can do all, you know, a renewed mind." Brother Brandham said, "If we love the fashions of the earth, if we love the trend of the day, think about it, current days norm." He says, "Oh, this is wonderful time. If you think that, he said it's because your thinking is wrong. He said, remember, he said, for if you love the world's order and the things of this present world because the love of God's not even in you. Amen. We don't want to filter the thoughts of God, not some podcast, not some celebrity. &gt;&gt; I only want my mind renewed by this word. That's it. Young people, &gt;&gt; young people, I can't stress it enough. [Music] Your generation is under so much pressure. I want to tell you tonight, you can stand the pressure, but what you need is not your thought, your strength, your might. What you need is a transforming power. But says if you haven't got an absolute an experience, he says that he says that you claim you have and you can deny everything of this [Music] He says you have he says you're trusting upon a bachelor of art degree. &gt;&gt; If you're trusting on your degree if you're trusting on your thoughts, oh the days of miracles are passed and no divine healing. He says, "If that's all you've got, you need a Damascus road experience &gt;&gt; that nobody &gt;&gt; can take away." Paul &gt;&gt; was a conformer. &gt;&gt; He had traditions. &gt;&gt; He followed them to the letter. And he acted in opposition to the very word of God. But his mind, his idea, he thought was falling right. &gt;&gt; But then a pillar of fire came across his way and it altered. had completely changed his thinking and took this same word. &gt;&gt; That's what it means. &gt;&gt; It's not my concept. &gt;&gt; He was a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; He was an attacker. &gt;&gt; A despiser, &gt;&gt; a hater, &gt;&gt; an antagonist. fighting the very God he thought he served. But one day, &gt;&gt; one day, he was going with purpose. He was on his horse. He thought he was doing things right. &gt;&gt; All right, come with me, boys. We want to take down the Christians. And then out of nowhere, pillar of fire. Says, "Sorry, Paul. You don't got it the way you think. I'm going to give you my thoughts. Why are you fighting against me, Paul? I've come to renew you. To transform you, to take you. I need you to get on. I'm going to put you on a new horse, a new power. is going to take you. &gt;&gt; I need you to lead my people. &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire has come at this hour so that you with the power of the Holy Spirit. Take the same word because you've been transformed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there's an account brother Brandham speaks about &gt;&gt; a a story. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says &gt;&gt; about the little girl young lady I should say and she was in an emergency room. She was in an insane asylum. Brother Brandham says maybe 30 cases of insanity around. &gt;&gt; He said she was from the psychopathic psychopathic. &gt;&gt; She had problems. &gt;&gt; She had problems. maybe 20, 25 years old. &gt;&gt; She's a place where crazy people go. &gt;&gt; That's where she was. Brother Brandon says, "How do you do?" &gt;&gt; She said, "How do you do?" She says, "Could you listen to my story a moment?" Brother says, "Certainly." And he said she started to tell him, "She was raised in a good home. My mother taught me not to do wrong, to shun evil, embrace the right thing." She says, "I lived that kind of life for a number of years, conforming. I just did what was right. I was raised in a good home. conforming. &gt;&gt; Then she started &gt;&gt; she got mixed up with a young man because conforming can't hold you. Young man comes by her way. Off she goes. Then she said she started she says I just throw myself away. I became an alcoholic. And then the good shepherds or they throw me to the Catholic institution, Good Shepherds and I was under correction and she just was conforming and they let her go drinking again. Then she says, "I changed from Catholic to Protestant." And then the chaplain started to talk to me and I came out and I tried again. She tried to conform again. &gt;&gt; But her brand says, "Where's your mother?" She's dead. &gt;&gt; She's dead. She says, "Oh, if I could only go back again." But Abraham says, "A lovely young woman like you. Don't you desire to be married?" Have babies like a mother. &gt;&gt; She said, "Oh, I'd love to, sir. What could I look offer anybody? Look at me." But Brand says, "You have one thing that you can offer." So he said, "What's that?" He said, "You're sold to Christ. She said, "Sir, &gt;&gt; he wouldn't receive it." &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; She conformed pressure. Conformed &gt;&gt; pressure. She's broke to a place. Brother Brand said, "Just give your soul to him. Give your soul to Christ." Said he'd never receive. I've gone too far. &gt;&gt; I love Brother Brandon's response. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh yes, he will." &gt;&gt; You have never never gone too far. &gt;&gt; There's a yearning there. &gt;&gt; You could be sitting in this service tonight. Whatever said in a quote, "Just the fact that you're here shows that you have not crossed any line. Just the fact that you're here." The word in her day was before her. I've gone too far. Oh, no. No. He'll hear you. He wants to transform you. Brother Brandon said, "You're just turning pages." That's conforming. But you really come to him. Oh, she says, "What could he do with me? I'm too far gone." I said he can take you back [Music] &gt;&gt; to the time when you were an innocent girl. &gt;&gt; God's transforming power can bring you back to the point. It erases all your history. It erases your past, your drinking, your alcohol, your issues with relationships. Whatever your situation, my God can transform your life and make you a virgin. Oh my. He says the blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is sufficient and powerful to to transform &gt;&gt; the vilest sinner guillless. I don't know what your issues are tonight, but if there's one young lady or one young man, I'm telling you tonight, this word, this message has the power to bring you back to your ought to be placeless. [Music] But maybe your response, you said, "I've tried &gt;&gt; too many times." That's what she said to brother Brandham. "I've tried too many times." [Music] Brother Brham says, "I want to tell you, &gt;&gt; I believe your case has never been diagnosed right. He said, "You don't want to be like that." She said, "Certainly not." I said, "You don't want to be like that." And if your seed inside, your response is, "Certainly not." He says, "You don't have to." He says, "This may sound old-fashioned." He said, "It's the devil that's done that to you. He's got a hold of you, driving you to things you don't want to do." That's the diagnosis from the prophet. She looked at me with those big eyes. She says, "I've always believed that's the truth. [Music] It's the devil &gt;&gt; causing pressure driving you to do things you don't want to do. [Music] She said I'm a mental case. Brother Bram says you are &gt;&gt; but I said Jesus Christ restores mind. &gt;&gt; He said there's nothing too great for him. &gt;&gt; Do you think you'd do that for me? Do you think you'd do that for me? Tell you not in the history books. But can I point to so many that had the same situations that the mind needed to be restored? You were in sin, in alcohol, in drugs, immoral living, in religion, in religiosity. But Jesus came by your way. &gt;&gt; How? like a church age book drops &gt;&gt; into the hand of your pastor. What did it do? It transformed him. It drew him to the pole of eternity. Why? Because there was seed [Music] that was pulling draw him. &gt;&gt; That's what brought a prophet to this young lady. &gt;&gt; Oh, so she tried. She prayed for a few moments. Oh Lord, Lord, I just want to start a new one. Would you please God? She had some words. She says, "Brother Ram, Brother, I'm going to do a new start." &gt;&gt; But says, "Sister, &gt;&gt; it's not going to do you a bit of good." &gt;&gt; He says, "You're just going exactly the same road you've been on. I mean it from my heart. Brother says, "I know you do." This is the word. Delving deep, &gt;&gt; past the mind, past the spirit realm, &gt;&gt; and it's going to the soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; He says, "But the devil's stronger than any mental power. [Music] The reason I don't believe in intellectual religion, [Music] he says it's got to go deeper than you're thinking. He said it's got to be an experience. She said, "What must I do?" I said, "Stay right there. And he said, "We prayed &gt;&gt; and we prayed." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham went to other places now. He prayed with some other people. &gt;&gt; And he came back and she was still praying and he goes around back and he comes back to her again. And after a while, she got desperate. Lord, I just want to turn a new page. [Music] &gt;&gt; She got desperate. and she prayed. She said, "Lord, I'm not moving from here. I want to be like Jacob. I don't want to just be walking my thoughts, but I need to take hold of the angel. I've got to stay hold of the word." &gt;&gt; And she stayed there. And after a while, she was getting deeply sincere and she raised up and her tears are falling from her cheeks and she looked me in the face and she says, "Brother Brandon got brother, something's happened. What happened? Transformation, not confirmation. transformation then she don't even know what what happened my desires have changed my thoughts what what just took place I'll tell you what took place it's called the Holy Spirit came and abode [Music] &gt;&gt; into her soul I would say young person old I don't care who you are. If the transformation of God does not happen, at some point you break. &gt;&gt; But if you are transformed you, he will never break. because the word ripened within your heart. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says to bring forth &gt;&gt; and live what you're talking about [Music] because inside of you creates a force. [Music] You become the word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know that's a big one to swallow, &gt;&gt; but the word's deposited in you. So, and in the evil increases, but I want to say to you, you're unalterable. it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can't alter it. &gt;&gt; You can't change it. See, someone that's conformed. &gt;&gt; Who know who who's ever had a balloon in their hand? Had a balloon in their hand. &gt;&gt; It's got air in it. You can kind of press it. Kind of. It kind of changes. So, I push it this way. It goes like that. I push it this way. You know what I mean? It can be altered. It can be adjusted with the pressure. [Music] But when you're transformed, you can't be altered. So, Satan tries to place his hands on you and he starts to squeeze and he places you through a situation. You got to work through situation, a financial situation, maybe a son or daughter that's called. You know what a son and daughter does? No change. No change. Because inside is an equal force resting out there. [Music] I'm going to give you a little difference. &gt;&gt; The scripture says for such are false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves. Look at transforming into the apostles of Christ. Oh, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, brother Michael, brother, &gt;&gt; what does that mean?" &gt;&gt; They're transforming and no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. That That's scripture. I just read scripture. But I want you, you have to, you have to dig into scripture because that word transformed in that verse [Music] is a Greek word. It means to change the outward form. Satan can change the outward form. It's like this. Who has a garden? Anybody have a garden? So, we have some Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, say you have a garden &gt;&gt; and you want to change your garden to look like an Italian garden. It's still a garden. You've just changed its outward. Okay. &gt;&gt; That's the word that the Greek is using. Okay. But the word there's another word when Satan he can transform himself &gt;&gt; and he can change his outward appearance. [Music] But when the scripture says be ye transformed, &gt;&gt; that's a different word. That word is called metamorph. It changes the essence, &gt;&gt; not the outside, but the inside. &gt;&gt; Satan can only change the outside. He can make himself look different. He can disguise himself, but he does not have the ability to change the essence of who he is. Oh, some young girl comes your way. &gt;&gt; She's anointed to catch the eye of some young man &gt;&gt; or some prescription drug. [Music] Some situation that looks okay, but the essence of it to destroy you. &gt;&gt; That Satan, but God has a power &gt;&gt; to go past the outside, past the disguise. I just come to church. Glory. Hallelujah. And you can wear a disguise. God can do a metamorph and take the essence &gt;&gt; and take the wretched sinner &gt;&gt; and change it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll help you out. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom mentioned this a few days ago. Don't go there. Anybody seen a caterpillar? &gt;&gt; Caterpillar. &gt;&gt; Yeah, caterpillar. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Little caterpillar &gt;&gt; and he inches his way along. He's just toiling slowly. He sees a leaf. He choose the leaf. Choose this leaf. He just eats. He eats. He crawls hoping some bird doesn't eat him. He's stuck to the ground. &gt;&gt; We know the caterpillar. &gt;&gt; But something starts to happen. And he comes to the point where he's eaten. He can eat no more. He finds a hidden place and he wraps himself up &gt;&gt; and he he hangs there. And you know, you and I would look at it for a while and said, "Nothing's happening." But if you watch it little by little, He starts to change that caterpillar is is is adjusting. You can look at the sack. You say, "Well, nothing's happening." But inside the essence is changing something is changing. And maybe about eight plus days or so The ages go by and he starts to move. Something's happened to me. And he got tired of being locked in. And he starts to peel away the shell that's been around him because something inside of him that held him to the earth changed. now and he don't really start to well wait a second. What has happened? He gets some wings. They start to sprout. He starts to beat them a little bit and you he starts to look at him. Where's the old man? Where's the caterpillar? I can't find anything. My legs are different. My arms are different. My head is different. What are these things? &gt;&gt; He has been completely transformed. Completely. &gt;&gt; Not just an outside, but it is inside. That's what this word has come to do to you and me. We wrap ourselves in the word of this hour and we just bask in the word. &gt;&gt; Age upon age through seven church ages. The bride is wrapped in the word. But in this hour, the unveiling of God, we are no longer landbased creeping along the earth. God gave us wings to take us up to a heavenly realm. You are not a caterpillar. You have been called from an eternal realm to you to transform you into eternity. [Music] Amen. That's what this message that you heard this morning. &gt;&gt; It's calling you &gt;&gt; to transformation &gt;&gt; a little while ago. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. &gt;&gt; I was sitting pondering And you know, God's thoughts are eternal to us. &gt;&gt; Would we agree? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But not everything is eternal. &gt;&gt; Not everything's eternal. The devil ain't eternal. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about that. &gt;&gt; So I was thinking, you know, Lord, &gt;&gt; your thoughts are eternal. You thought of us. But not everybody is eternal beings because not everybody has a seed. So I was pondering that. So I just searched it a little bit and the first quote that came up. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Love chosen us before the foundation of the world." I said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Christ. You know what brother Brandham said next? &gt;&gt; He says, "What about that, brother Mike?" What? What about that, brother Mike? Little brother's talking to me. &gt;&gt; So now I was really reading. Isn't that wonderful? He loved you. He loved you before there was a world. [Music] He knows your nature. He knows your nature. He knows your weaknesses. He knows your habits. He knows all about you. What you was going to be. Then he looked over the whole universe and said, "I choose you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knows your weakness. &gt;&gt; He knows your failings. &gt;&gt; He knows your mistakes. &gt;&gt; He knows where you trip and fall. All of that aspect of you. He looked over the whole universe and he says, "I choose you. I choose you. I choose you. It has nothing to do with your merit. He said when he did that before there was ever a speck of life, then you're eternal with God. He says then you become eternal because you're part of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's brother Tom speaking about the word becoming personal this morning. &gt;&gt; Because when you read this message, you realize and you say, "Hey, that's me." &gt;&gt; That's seeing your name in the book. [Music] &gt;&gt; So better tell him to say, "Don't over complicate it. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, why don't the musicians come? But &gt;&gt; that's what this message is all about. is to bring us back to Eden again, &gt;&gt; to bring us back to the original. [Music] &gt;&gt; If I could say it is to bring a Samson back to full strength, poor old Samson has forgotten who he was. &gt;&gt; He'd got lost this way, his own idea that way. Satan had got him bound up bound up on this grinder. His mind &gt;&gt; was in need of a renewing and he must have pushed that mill around and his memory. You must have been thinking, "Oh, remember that time when I took those Philistines down and broke the cords, but they were I remember he starts to remember." &gt;&gt; Maybe around that time. His hand went to brush his hair a little bit. He started to feel something. Wait, there there's a lot more hair there. the covenant that he was born under &gt;&gt; was growing out. And he started to recognize that he was again. He started to remember down through these ages. The Lord, the church, grinding through the ages. But in the seventh age, when the word opened up, My bride starts to remember who I am. &gt;&gt; Samson start to feel the pain. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. There was a time when I had a job in my life and I flew the Philistines. That's what we are right now. We're realizing to this hour. to renew our mind back to who we are. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; You know, so many under pressure in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Oh, the poor Hebrew boys under pressure in scripture. The what? The Hebrew boys. Oh, there's too much to talk about. But you know what? You know, in the pressure. The Hebrew boys are in the fire. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine standing in the furnace? [Music] Heated up seven times. [Music] Anybody got burned yet lately? How does it feel? It feels good to be burned. &gt;&gt; Yes. Who loves burning? Nobody. Nobody. No. Nobody. You touch the flame. It's &gt;&gt; instant. &gt;&gt; And then you look at it like, "Oh my god. Then your fingers tender. &gt;&gt; I can't do that because I got burned. They were staring at a fire time heat pressure. Bow. Come on. Bow. You're going there. The flesh is going to melt. Come on, just bow a little bit. It's just a little thing. Just image. Is it really that big of a deal? I'll never bow. and they exerted pressure on them, but they were seed and so they could stand the pressure. They said, "God's able to deliver us, but even so, he does it. Even so, we will not bow. I know I'm going through Leodosa. I know it's difficult. I know you're under pressure. I know you young people go through it. The world is trying to make you break. [Music] I will never bow. I know my God can deliver me from this situation. If I have to walk through the valley of the shadow of death can be all around me, &gt;&gt; but I will not bow. You know what happened? They walked. The soldiers soldier one dies. Soldier two. Shadrach [Applause] two like you like you standing shoulders back stand strong Shadrach we won't bow to no image for one the flames didn't touch [Music] Have you ever been around a fire? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then you come back from the fire. I'm a smoke stack. You try to wash your hair. Hey, who's been around the fire? Yeah, me. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were inside the [Applause] smell like smoke. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are in the fire. You're in the fire of Leodysia, but you're walking with a transformed life inside. And you don't even smell like this world. Know what he say? You're so You don't even look like the woman. &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing about you. &gt;&gt; You ladies look so pure. &gt;&gt; You don't look like a pure lady. &gt;&gt; I know it's cuz I'm transformed. &gt;&gt; But do you know the best part? The best part is not that they just withtood pressure. the heat in the moment of the most difficult hour in the worst of the ages, &gt;&gt; the darkest of hours, the son of man himself into the fire. You're not alone. &gt;&gt; You're not alone. &gt;&gt; You're not walking in the fire alone. He's waiting for you. He's standing in the middle. See you can make it strengthening you. I'm with you to the end to the end of the world. I will never forsake you. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where you are. Being ye not conformed, but being ye transformed, eternity is present with you in this hour to draw you. [Applause] Hallelujah. Don't be afraid. Amen. Don't be afraid. God bless you. We're in the heat together. We're in the fire together. &gt;&gt; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. &gt;&gt; They had company. They were in the fire together. This bride is together. &gt;&gt; Have no fear. with you. I will not leave you comfortless. Amen. Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. God bless you. God bless you. [Applause] Let's give the Lord a hand. &gt;&gt; This is special. &gt;&gt; This is special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we really thank God. [Applause] against the need to be transformed. They see humanity always tends to go the way of least resistance. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The call we have &gt;&gt; is under go. &gt;&gt; It evolves some level. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We should not go the way of least resistance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to go upward. and you're not going upward, there is some bit of strength involved. So the good fight is to fight against the contemporary flow. [Music] That where the world goes, we go with it. How they dress, we dress with them. We must keep our eye on Christ the north star. [Music] &gt;&gt; You see, you just need to see the steady stand because the power to transform is in the revealed word. The word is our energizer. We are actually charged by the word to go upward. You see the way of less resistance makes us flow backwards to Jericho. But the labor upward and the strength to transform is that word which goes to your soul. Amen. It's the kind of amount of pressure which will be pressing from the inside to resist the weight of the five elephants. Otherwise, if there is nothing in there, it just comes up. But as we keep the word, we are keeping enough pressure because the pressure of this day is bow or be broken. &gt;&gt; But we tell the devil, we shall not bow to you. The word in you is the power that drives against the pressure that the world tries to push against you. What I loved most is when the brother brought conforming to church, you know, just a rich younger ruler, especially our children raised in the message. They've been raised with terminologies of brother, God bless you. They've been developed with the culture to pray, how to dress and to keep their life around church. They conform. There is a way one can conform. But conforming to church atmosphere is not the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth will seal the little holes where the water down in the ocean would try to filter into. That's what the Holy Ghost does. He goes sealing all those little holes. So we are made out of a tree that can let the water in. Amen. But we thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He keeps looking for those little holes, those little weaknesses, those little failures and seals them that while we are in school, our places of work in different places, we can be able to stand the pressure. Amen. So the Holy Ghost wants to seal us not till the next revival. So when he does the sealing, he seals that part permanently. Amen. So we need to come and face reality deep down in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, am I conforming? All I need to be transformed &gt;&gt; because you know when the brother was talking about the metamorphosis when this caterpillar changes when it's a caterpillar acts a certain way it has a particular appetite and once it's transformed it doesn't have a desire to become a caterpillar again. Are you together with me? And so when it's, you know, covered under the cocoon, then again it kind of pushes out and it becomes something else. The mind changes, the appetite changes. our desire. God be gracious that we may not be conformed but that we may be transformed to the renewing of our mind. And when the mind is changed, then everything that comes out of us is totally changed. No wonder Paul says, "Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus." Would you call the mind of Christ down? Amen. Come down to become my mind that I may think like a God that I may not just be conformed but that I may be transformed. I know that you are fighting a battle and it was not easy for that young girl, amen, to win that battle. She came and told brother Brham, I think I'm mentally cracked. And brother Brham said, "Yes, you are." So what do you need to stay on the knees until the change come? &gt;&gt; To stay on the knees until that change comes. Brother Joshua, you can come over. Would you say, "Lord, I want to be transformed." In areas where you're conforming, tell that's not enough for me. There must come a power to fully transform me into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you, brother. We really appreciate you coming our way. Brother Tom, it's always the third weekend of October. &gt;&gt; It's always the third weekend of October and we are looking forward the next year. Don't you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We certainly appreciate this is a great vast. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, God bless you for being a father to this brother Michael. No wonder he says he was raised in a good family. Amen. So pastors, children, there is a lot to fight for. Don't confirm. Brother Michael says it came to the reality that he personally needed Christ. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I believe you've been fed. I believe you've been fed. And you are even [Music] [Applause] do you want to be transformed? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing and say I surrender. I surrender and to the Lord. This is the one. I surrender [Music] oh to you Lord. I surrender. I surrender to you my blessed savior. Oh to thee my blessed savior. I surrender.
