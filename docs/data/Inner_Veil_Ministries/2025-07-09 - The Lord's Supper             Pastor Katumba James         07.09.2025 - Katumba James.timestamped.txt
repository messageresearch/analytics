[3:34] &gt;&gt; And get me that song.
[3:37] There is now no condemnation for those
[3:39] who are in Christ. for the original
[3:41] songs.
[3:43] Amen. Romans 8:1 says, "There's
[3:46] therefore no condemnation
[3:50] 81
[3:56] for those who are in Christ,
[3:59] who walk not after flesh,
[4:03] but by the spirit."
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to sing with you this
[4:09] song.
[4:13] There is now no condemnation
[4:19] for those who are in Christ
[4:23] who walk not
[4:26] after flesh
[4:28] or the spirit and his word.
[4:34] For the love
[4:36] of the spirit
[4:39] in Christ
[4:41] sets me free from sin and death that
[4:46] long had bound me.
[4:50] Hallelu.
[4:52] [Music]
[4:54] Oh I have passed from death to life.
[4:58] Let's put our hands together. by the
[5:01] precious blood of Christ. Oh bleeding
[5:06] lamb and sacrifice,
[5:09] [Music]
[5:10] washing all my sins away.
[5:15] I now stand so justified,
[5:21] sanctified
[5:23] and baptized
[5:26] fully with the promised Holy Spirit.
[5:31] Hallelu.
[5:34] Oh, I have passed. I have passed from
[5:38] death to life
[5:41] by the precious blood of Christ. Oh,
[5:46] bleeding lamb and sacrifice
[5:51] washing all my sins, all my sins away.
[5:56] And I now stand so justified,
[6:02] sanctified
[6:04] and baptized,
[6:07] fully with the promised Holy Spirit.
[6:12] Hallelu,
[6:14] I am free.
[6:17] I was bound by chains of sin,
[6:23] distress
[6:24] and unbelief.
[6:27] With all hope lost, my strength was
[6:31] gone.
[6:33] as the accuser convicted me of my bad
[6:38] past and daily failures
[6:43] that kept blinding me from Calvary. But
[6:48] when I got through revelation,
[6:52] oh, I broke free from selfdefeat.
[6:57] Though I have passed from death to life,
[7:03] oh by the precious blood of Christ,
[7:08] bleeding lamb and sacrifice.
[7:13] Oh, washing all my sins away.
[7:18] I now stand so justified,
[7:24] sanctified
[7:25] and baptized
[7:28] fully with the promised Holy Spirit.
[7:33] Oh hallelujah. Let's sing in Luganda
[7:36] now.
[7:38] Oh father, next
[7:47] [Music]
[7:49] Why?

[7:58] [Music]
[8:14] Hallelujah.
[8:17] Sing with me again.
[8:33] [Music]
[8:56] One more time English I have passed from
[9:01] death to life.
[9:03] Oh by the precious blood of Christ
[9:08] leading lamp and sacrifice.
[9:13] Oh washing all my sins away.
[9:18] And I now stand so justified,
[9:24] sanctified
[9:26] and baptized,
[9:29] fully with the promised Holy Spirit.
[9:34] Hallelu,
[9:36] I am free. Are you free this afternoon?
[9:42] Amen. We are free
[9:46] from the law of sin and death.
[9:51] We are washed now
[9:55] and we no longer have sin.
[9:59] And the prophet says it's not because we
[10:02] are sinless,
[10:06] but because there's a perfect sacrifice,
[10:11] it makes us sinless.
[10:15] Amen. Amen. So I just want to sing with
[10:18] you and say, I'm a child of a king. I'm
[10:21] a child of a king.
[10:27] His royal blood

[11:03] the wealth
[11:05] of his world in his hands
[11:10] of rubies
[11:12] and diamonds of silver
[11:17] and gold.

[11:36] with Jesus
[11:39] my savior.
[11:41] I'm a child
[11:43] of my father. My father's
[11:48] own son, the savior
[11:52] of men,
[11:54] once
[11:57] over
[11:59] as the poor rest of them. Oh, but now
[12:06] he's reigning

[12:13] and will give me a home
[12:17] in heaven by

[12:24] of the king.
[12:27] A child
[12:29] of the king
[12:31] with Jesus
[12:34] my savior.
[12:36] I'm a child. I once was an outcast.
[12:40] I once
[12:42] was an outcast,
[12:45] a stranger,
[12:48] a sinner by choice, a sinner
[12:52] by choice,

[13:39] the king.
[13:41] A child
[13:44] of the king.
[13:46] With Jesus

[14:02] Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; What a fellowship we have.
[14:10] Let us sing a song.
[14:13] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[14:15] it's not difficult to be used of the
[14:18] Holy Spirit.
[14:21] It's not difficult at all.
[14:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[14:27] you just yield yourself
[14:30] just been continuous communion

[14:37] has promised
[14:39] they just come to be manifested in your
[14:41] life
[14:43] because it's a flowing stream.
[14:47] So you find this one has come out. This
[14:49] one has come out. The Lord shows you
[14:51] things which are going to be. The Lord
[14:54] reminds you
[14:58] You know, you start seeing yourself that
[15:00] you start having a burden to witness.
[15:05] You have a burden to pray for people.
[15:08] Then sometimes you know you intercede
[15:10] for somebody
[15:13] and then somebody tells you that the
[15:15] other day I was feeling like this and
[15:18] it's just the Holy Spirit.
[15:20] Praise the name of our Lord and just

[15:26] Praise the name of our Lord. That song,
[15:28] let the living water flow.

[15:38] then you'll see how the Lord will use
[15:39] you for his kingdom.
[15:43] Amen. Amen.
[15:46] Let the living water flow over
[15:52] my soul.
[15:55] Let the Holy Spirit come and take
[16:00] control.

[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Father, how we thank you for this
[20:18] afternoon.
[20:20] The grace that you've given unto us
[20:22] again
[20:24] that we can come into your presence.
[20:27] We pray may bless us again. Speak to our
[20:30] hearts, Father. May we have such
[20:32] communion, Lord. And then as we come
[20:35] into the Lord's supper, may also bless
[20:39] us. and through the way all the needs of
[20:42] your children
[20:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Is there any song?
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Let us go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[20:59] Chapter 11
[21:04] and then from verse 20 to verse 26.
[21:11] So the Bible says,
[21:13] "When you come together therefore into
[21:15] one place,
[21:18] this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
[21:22] For in the eating everyone taketh before
[21:25] the other his own supper, and one is
[21:27] hungry, and another is drunken.
[21:44] What have you
[21:46] have you not houses to eat and drink in
[21:49] or despise ye the church of God and
[21:52] shame them that have not? What shall I
[21:55] say unto you? Shall I praise you in
[21:57] this? Shall I I shall I praise you not?
[22:32] For I have received of the Lord that
[22:34] which also I delivered unto you, that
[22:37] the Lord Jesus, the same night in which
[22:39] he was betrayed, took bread,
[22:54] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[22:56] it and said, "Take eat. This is my body
[22:59] which is broken for you. This do in
[23:01] remembrance of me.
[23:07] After
[23:15] the same manner also he took the cup
[23:18] when he had sed saying, "This is the
[23:20] cup. This is the new testament in my
[23:23] blood. This do as often as you drink it
[23:26] in remembrance of me.
[23:40] For as of as you eat this bread and
[23:44] drink this cup, you do show the Lord his
[23:47] death till he come.
[23:58] May God speak of his word.
[24:00] You may be seated.
[24:02] So we want to share on the Lord's
[24:04] supper.
[24:06] Praise the name of our Lord.
[24:09] Ideally these were meant to be all
[24:10] morning service.
[24:13] Then I was meant to pick something else
[24:15] for the afternoon service
[24:18] but we couldn't do that. I believe was
[24:21] the work of the Lord.
[24:23] That the morning we talk about the
[24:25] spiritual communion.
[24:29] Then in the evening we talk about the
[24:31] physical.
[24:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[24:36] message communion
[24:38] of 1965,
[24:41] brother Brennham says you don't take the
[24:44] Lord's supper by a tradition.
[24:50] Like now we see the denominations.
[24:52] They do it as a tradition.
[24:55] There is a denomination whereby every
[24:57] time they have a service they have to do
[24:59] it
[25:02] even at the barrier they do it
[25:05] just a tradition.
[25:07] Now he says you take it because it is
[25:10] the love of God
[25:14] in your heart.
[25:16] Now see how it comes here. You do it
[25:21] because it is the love of God
[25:24] in your heart in keeping the
[25:27] commandments of God
[25:30] because you've heard that the Lord has
[25:32] told us to do it.
[25:34] And now when God presents an opportunity
[25:37] to us
[25:39] that we are going to observe the Lord's
[25:41] supper on this particular day.
[25:45] Praise the name of our Lord. You make
[25:47] sure that you are part of that service.
[25:50] And you see they were observing the
[25:52] Lord's supper
[25:55] in the first in the in the book of Acts.
[25:59] When we go to the book of Acts
[26:02] and then we read in chapter 2 and verse
[26:04] 42,
[26:08] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "And they continued
[26:11] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[26:14] fellowship and in the breaking of bread
[26:17] and in prayers.
[26:32] It was the commandment of the Lord.
[26:36] So now they said they contined
[26:38] steadfastly.
[26:43] And then now when you go go to verse 46,
[26:47] the Bible says, "And they continuing
[26:49] daily with one accord in the temple
[26:53] and in the breaking of bread from house
[26:55] to house did eat their meat with
[26:57] gladness and singleness of art.
[27:10] [Music]
[27:17] Now in Leviticus chapter 23,
[27:21] there are feast that the Lord told the
[27:22] children of Israel to observe.
[27:29] And now the first feast,
[27:33] praise the name of our Lord, was the
[27:35] feast of the Passover.
[27:39] because he told them this shall be the
[27:42] beginning of your days.
[27:46] You start from this day to count your
[27:48] years.
[27:50] You start from this day to count your
[27:52] calendar.
[27:55] I think let us pick up Exodus 12 before
[27:58] we go to that part.
[28:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Exodus 12
[28:11] and then we we pick up from verse
[28:21] verse six.
[28:23] He says,
[28:25] &gt;&gt; "And you shall keep it until the 14th
[28:29] day of the same month, and the whole
[28:31] assembly of Israel
[28:36] shall kill it in the evening.
[28:49] And then
[28:51] verse 97, and you shall take the blood
[28:54] and sprinkle it on the two side posts,
[28:57] on the upper door post of the houses
[28:59] where you shall eat it.
[29:13] And they shall eat the flesh in the
[29:15] night roast with fire and and unleaven
[29:18] bread and with bitter hops they shall
[29:21] eat it.
[29:35] Now in verse 14 he says,
[29:39] "And this shall be unto you for a
[29:41] memorial, and you shall keep it a feast
[29:44] to the Lord throughout your generations.
[29:46] You shall keep it a feast by an
[29:49] orodiness forever.
[30:10] praise the name of our Lord. So it was
[30:13] the first feast
[30:15] and you know that it marks your
[30:18] beginning
[30:21] because they were leaving Egypt and then
[30:23] they were going into the land of
[30:24] promise.
[30:26] And you know that night an angel passed
[30:29] killing was born.
[30:33] But then on the doorpost where there was
[30:35] applied blood
[30:38] death was not in that house.
[30:41] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[30:43] now the angel would pass over.
[30:46] And then he said this is the Lord's
[30:48] Passover.
[30:50] And then he said observe it in your
[30:52] generation.
[30:55] So they were doing it every year.
[30:58] They had a particular time that they
[31:01] would observe that.
[31:04] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[31:06] they would have only unleavened bread.
[31:10] You know leaven stands for sin.
[31:15] But now this bread had no leaven in it.
[31:19] So they had to observe that.
[31:23] And so every when that day comes, they
[31:26] had they had to kill an animal
[31:29] for the Passover.
[31:32] And we know that the blood of the animal
[31:36] that's where the life is.
[31:38] But then for them they were eating the
[31:40] meat
[31:42] because they wouldn't take the blood of
[31:43] the animal.
[31:45] God told them they shall not eat the the
[31:48] blood of the animal.
[31:50] So now they were eating the meat,
[31:53] roasting it and then eating it. But the
[31:56] whole thing is an animal had given its
[31:59] life.
[32:01] Praise the name of Allah. Protect these
[32:03] people from death.
[32:06] And then we see that our Lord Jesus
[32:07] Christ
[32:09] comes and fulfills that
[32:12] as the Passover lamb.
[32:17] He's the one who took the death.
[32:20] He's the one who reconciled us back to
[32:22] God.
[32:24] So he comes as the Passover lamb
[32:29] in 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[32:32] and then verse 7.
[32:34] Praise the name of our Lord.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[32:38] &gt;&gt; "Punch out therefore the old leaven that
[32:42] you may be a new lamp as you are
[32:45] unleavened. For even Christ our Passover
[32:49] is sacrificed for us.
[33:10] So he said punch out the old leaven,
[33:14] take out your sinful life,
[33:17] sinful thoughts, sinful ways, punch them
[33:21] out. Now when you punch them out, then
[33:26] you are not having that leaven
[33:30] And that's the life that we should live
[33:33] in order to have communion with the Holy
[33:36] Spirit.
[33:38] And then he says, "Therefore, let us
[33:40] keep the feast, not with the old leaven,
[33:44] neither with the leaven of malice and
[33:46] wickedness, but with the unleavened
[33:48] bread of sincerity and truth.
[34:08] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[34:10] "Don't have that leaven
[34:14] of malice,
[34:16] of wickedness,
[34:18] the things we're talking about in the
[34:20] morning which actually grieve the Holy
[34:23] Spirit
[34:24] and then they take you from the
[34:26] fellowship
[34:28] from the communion
[34:30] of the Holy Spirit. Now this means we
[34:34] shouldn't only be careful
[34:37] when we are coming to the Lord's supper
[34:40] but yet our daytoday living
[34:44] every day that we are alive
[34:47] we need to make sure we are right with
[34:50] God.
[34:51] Praise the name of the Lord. That should
[34:53] be our living
[34:56] that every day I'm walking clean.
[35:00] Every day I'm speaking right.
[35:04] Every day I'm thinking right.
[35:07] Every day I'm walking right. Not only
[35:10] when we are going to have the Lord
[35:11] supper.
[35:13] I spend the whole Friday
[35:16] praying and fasting. Lord make me
[35:18] worthy.
[35:20] Then I make sure that I don't pick any
[35:22] calls on Saturday
[35:25] in church. Now when I come on Sunday,
[35:29] I'm worthy.
[35:31] How about Monday?
[35:34] Praise the name of our Lord. How about
[35:36] Tuesday? So when you do like that, it's
[35:40] a tradition now.
[35:43] It's just a tradition.
[35:46] like the denominations
[35:48] they start on Ash Wednesday I think to
[35:51] fast
[35:54] and then you know I'm not going to eat
[35:56] meat
[35:57] maybe I don't know whether I can't
[35:59] afford it the whole month so he says I'm
[36:01] fasting meat
[36:03] I'm not going to drink
[36:06] I'm not going to go to the bar
[36:08] I'm fasting
[36:10] now the moment he finishes the fasting
[36:13] he has already saved money to drink a
[36:15] whole crate of beer
[36:19] That's not the way to do. But that's how
[36:22] they do
[36:24] tradition
[36:26] when they are coming to the church
[36:31] to them. That's now being humble.
[36:34] How about at home when you are shouting
[36:36] at your wife?
[36:41] Praise the name of the place. They told
[36:44] me
[36:46] that these brothers
[36:49] they are highly placed in the district.
[36:53] So when they come to on Monday in the
[36:55] offices putting on a tie suit nice shoes
[37:03] of the district service commission
[37:11] but when it comes to church sleepers
[37:15] and touched his shirt.
[37:17] Brother, we are meant to be humble.
[37:21] That's not true.
[37:23] That's not the humility.
[37:26] But you know, it's just some kind of
[37:28] tradition.
[37:30] When they define modest,
[37:37] they think you have to be sharp.
[37:40] No,
[37:42] you know there are those people with
[37:43] that kind of mindset,
[37:46] &gt;&gt; but that's not the thing.
[37:49] Praise the name of our Lord. So then you
[37:51] need to see that every day.
[37:54] you qualify
[37:57] to take the Lord's supper
[38:01] because that's how you keep the
[38:02] communion of the Holy Spirit
[38:05] because you need the spirit of God every
[38:08] day in your life. So you need to see
[38:11] that the stream is flowing.
[38:15] The Holy Spirit is communicating
[38:18] also communicating
[38:21] the whole day. Praise the name of our
[38:23] Lord. Those are the kind of lives we
[38:25] need to live.
[38:27] So they had it as a feast.
[38:31] Let us go back to Leviticus chapter 2.
[38:35] And they were observing this as their
[38:37] first feast.
[38:42] Praise the name of our Lord. He says in
[38:44] verse four,
[38:46] "These are the feasts of the Lord, even
[38:48] the holy convocations,
[38:51] which
[38:52] you shall proclaim in their seasons.
[39:18] in the 14th day of the first month at
[39:22] even that's evening is the Lord's
[39:24] Passover.
[39:35] So they were observing that every 14th
[39:38] of the first month.
[39:45] That was Passover.
[39:48] So they had to get an animal,
[39:52] sacrifice that animal
[39:55] and then roast the meat
[39:57] and eat it with actually unleavened
[40:01] bread
[40:03] observing the Lord's Passover.
[40:09] Praise the name of our Lord. They had to
[40:11] do it every year.
[40:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[40:17] book of Luke chapter 22
[40:21] and then verse 9,
[40:27] it says, "Then came the day of the
[40:30] unleven bread when the Passover must be
[40:34] killed."
[40:45] So they were killing an animal every
[40:48] Passover.
[40:51] And then he sent Peter and John saying,
[40:54] "Go prepare us the Passover that we may
[40:58] eat."
[41:08] to
[41:11] praise the name of our Lord. He sent
[41:14] them now this day here made a change of
[41:19] things.
[41:21] Praise the name of our Lord. They were
[41:22] used to killing animals,
[41:25] roasting them
[41:28] for the Passover. But now this time,
[41:32] Christ tells them
[41:35] we only going to have unleaven bread
[41:39] and then the wine.
[41:41] And then he gives a definition
[41:45] what these symbols stand for.
[41:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[41:52] Matthew chapter 26
[41:55] and then verse
[41:57] 26,
[42:00] he says, "And as they were eating,
[42:03] Jesus took the bread
[42:06] and blessed it and broke it and give it
[42:11] to the disciples
[42:13] and said, "Take,
[42:17] eat, this is my
[42:21] Now in the Old Testament
[42:24] there were families doing that
[42:27] but now here it is a fellowship
[42:32] a collection of believers
[42:35] and then the Bible said they were moving
[42:37] from house to house
[42:40] observing the Lord's supper
[42:43] and then Paul was telling them when you
[42:46] come to the supper
[42:48] don't come When you are hungry,
[42:52] oh
[42:53] they giving me small because you are
[42:56] hungry. You want to be satisfied.
[42:59] No, it's not coming to just be full.
[43:02] I say, oh, we have not been drinking
[43:05] wine. Now it's an opportunity. Give me
[43:07] the whole bottle.
[43:11] And then you become drunken.
[43:14] No, don't do that.
[43:17] Eat.
[43:19] When you come here, receive what is
[43:21] being given to you,
[43:24] praise the name over. Now, supposing we
[43:26] are too many and then they giving you
[43:29] something as small as a name.
[43:38] So, he says if you want to eat a lot,
[43:42] eat from there. Then when you come here,
[43:46] it's not coming to be full.
[43:49] It's not coming to be drunk,
[43:52] but it is coming to observe
[43:56] do in remembrance of the Lord
[44:01] till he come. Praise the name of our
[44:04] Lord. So now the Lord say this bread,
[44:09] praise the name of the Lord without
[44:11] leaven,
[44:13] he said it stands for my body.
[44:18] So he took it. He broke it. Why was he
[44:22] breaking it? Because the body was
[44:26] pierced through.
[44:29] Praise the name of our Lord. The body
[44:32] was smitten.
[44:34] the body, you know, was kind of, you
[44:37] know, like striped.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; So they were breaking it.
[44:44] So even now he's saying this, take it
[44:46] and break it.
[44:50] Praise the name of our Lord and then he
[44:52] gave thanks and then he gave to the
[44:55] disciple. He said take this
[44:59] is my body. So now the true meaning of
[45:03] this
[45:05] came out when Jesus gave the definition.
[45:09] So the unleavened bread
[45:12] stands for the body of Jesus.
[45:14] Praise the name of our lord. And also if
[45:18] we are filled with the holy spirit.
[45:20] We become part of the body of Jesus
[45:23] Christ.
[45:25] Because the bible says we are baptized
[45:27] into one body.
[45:30] 1 Corinthians 12:3
[45:33] we are baptized into one body
[45:36] and the Holy Spirit.
[45:39] So now if you are really part of the
[45:40] body of Christ
[45:43] you would want to fulfill the
[45:44] commandment of the Lord
[45:48] and you are doing it out of love
[45:51] not a tradition
[45:53] and neither do we do it because we want
[45:56] to find out.
[46:01] who is not living right. No,
[46:04] &gt;&gt; we don't do roll calls.
[46:07] Why did you miss the other day, then
[46:10] again this day?
[46:14] There must be something wrong with you.
[46:18] We don't do that to do that.
[46:21] But we want to fulfill the commandment
[46:23] of the Lord.
[46:27] You do it out of love.
[46:29] You don't do it because you are
[46:31] compelled.
[46:36] No, if I don't know, they will think I'm
[46:37] not living out of love.
[46:41] Praise the name of God. So he says,
[46:43] "This is my body."
[46:46] And then he took the cup and gave thanks
[46:50] and gave it unto them, saying, "Drink ye
[46:53] all of it.
[47:02] Now they were not before drinking wine.
[47:10] They were not taking it
[47:13] but they were eating meat,
[47:16] roasted meat, but now they roasted meat
[47:19] because they no longer going to kill the
[47:21] animal.
[47:23] He says in the animal
[47:25] it was actually the the flesh
[47:29] which you were eating but the main thing
[47:32] in the animal
[47:35] is the blood because the life of the
[47:37] flesh is in the blood but you can't eat
[47:41] blood
[47:43] because that's the word of the lord
[47:46] the wine
[47:47] is now the representation of the blood
[47:52] is the representation of the life. And
[47:55] then he says now this wine
[47:59] is my blood.
[48:01] Praise the name of God. So there was a
[48:03] change
[48:05] and he said this is my blood in the new
[48:09] testament
[48:12] which is shed for many for the remission
[48:15] of sins.
[48:19] Now the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:22] is what brings the new testament.
[48:27] Now when they were making the old
[48:29] testament
[48:31] they used animal blood
[48:34] in Exodus chapter 24.
[48:37] Praise the name of the Lord. Exodus
[48:40] chapter 24
[48:42] and then we read verse 8.
[48:47] And Moses took the blood
[48:50] and sprinkled it upon the people
[48:53] and saying, "Behold the blood of the
[48:57] covenant
[49:00] which is which the Lord has made with
[49:03] you concerning all these words.
[49:08] So the Old Testament
[49:10] is under the blood of animals.
[49:14] Praise the name of our Lord. They had to
[49:16] be eating meat every Passover.
[49:20] But we are in the New Testament
[49:24] which is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[49:27] There's no more animal sacrifice.
[49:31] Praise the name of God. But now we do
[49:34] eat in the memorial
[49:37] of the death of Jesus Christ
[49:40] that when he died, he shed blood for our
[49:43] sins.
[49:45] Praise the name of our Lord. But when he
[49:47] shed blood for our sins, the Holy Spirit
[49:51] comes back to the soul of the
[49:52] repentance.
[49:56] Praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[49:58] in the Old Testament, they only doing it
[50:01] once a year.
[50:03] In the New Testament,
[50:05] as often,
[50:09] praise the name of as often as you can.
[50:14] Praise the name of our Lord. You
[50:16] remember his death, burial and
[50:18] resurrection.
[50:21] Now the blood of the New Testament
[50:24] was under you know was animal blood
[50:29] and it brought the law. We are no longer
[50:32] bound by the blood of the new testament.
[50:38] But now we are under the blood of the
[50:40] new testament.
[50:43] which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:46] The blood of the Old Testament
[50:48] was animal blood and it brought the
[50:51] Lord. But the blood of the New Testament
[50:56] has brought us grace.
[50:59] Praise the name of our Lord. It has
[51:01] brought us grace. He has brought us
[51:04] salvation.
[51:05] He has brought us healing.
[51:07] He has brought us deliverance.
[51:10] So everything you do by the blood of
[51:14] Jesus
[51:15] brings you victory.
[51:17] Praise the name of our Lord. It brings
[51:19] you deliverance.
[51:21] That's why in the name of the Lord,
[51:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[51:28] Everything can be done.
[51:30] You can pray for anything in the name of
[51:32] the Lord Jesus.
[51:34] Praise the name of our Lord. So the wine
[51:38] stands for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[51:41] And he said this is the new testament.
[51:46] Praise the name of our Lord. So that
[51:48] Passover night.
[51:52] Christ fulfilled the killing of the
[51:55] animals
[51:58] and said I am now the Passover lamb.
[52:02] This is my blood.
[52:05] take it in remembrance of me.
[52:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[52:09] verse 9 of Mark chapter 26.
[52:15] But I say unto you, I will not drink
[52:18] henceforth of this fruit of the vine
[52:20] until that day when I drink it new with
[52:23] you in the Father's kingdom.
[52:56] It says at that time
[52:59] the Lord supper
[53:01] after the rapture
[53:03] says, "I'm going to take it."
[53:06] I know the Bible says that the last
[53:09] enemy
[53:11] shall be dead
[53:13] and the rapture
[53:15] means our bodies, our mortal bodies
[53:20] shall be fully redeemed.
[53:23] Right now, it's the soul that has been
[53:24] redeemed.
[53:26] But this body has not yet been redeemed.
[53:29] Praise the name of our Lord. This body
[53:31] can be attacked of anything.
[53:34] It's not the soul that has been
[53:36] redeemed.
[53:38] This body can be you know attacked by
[53:41] the devil any time.
[53:44] It can die can fall sick. But the
[53:48] redemption of this body is when this
[53:51] body
[53:52] the motor body shall put on imotear.
[53:57] When this mortal body can never die.
[54:01] When this mortal body can never grow
[54:03] old. When this mortal body can never
[54:07] become sick.
[54:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he say
[54:12] that's the time I'll drink with you in
[54:13] the kingdom.
[54:15] When the last enemy has been put down,
[54:19] the body of Jesus Christ
[54:21] has all been redeemed.
[54:24] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[54:26] as we live in this body,
[54:29] the Bible says, offer your body as a
[54:33] living sacrifice.
[54:35] [Music]
[54:37] Be careful where you go.
[54:40] Be careful the people you associate
[54:42] with.
[54:43] Be careful the things you watch.
[54:46] Be careful the things you hear
[54:49] because the devil uses all these avenues
[54:53] to come and attack you.
[54:56] and your testimony,
[55:00] your walk.
[55:02] And that's what the devil likes. You see
[55:05] that he puts you in regret.
[55:08] He makes you do something wrong. Then he
[55:11] comes on the side and starts laughing.
[55:19] Some people do also like that.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; But the devil has made you do those
[55:22] things. Those same friends you go with
[55:26] in this cohort.
[55:36] They just start shaming you.
[55:40] They just make you just become wasted.
[55:45] So you offer your body as a living
[55:47] sacrifice.
[55:50] You don't go in bad places.
[55:52] The Bible says abstain from appearance
[55:55] of all evil.
[55:58] So you avoid those places which are not
[56:01] right. Praise the name of our Lord. Your
[56:05] body is not yet redeemed.
[56:08] So watch it.
[56:11] Be careful.
[56:13] It has not yet been redeemed. The Bible
[56:15] says these are vile bodies.
[56:21] You know,
[56:24] anytime it can be put down,
[56:28] sickness can put it down.
[56:34] This man was
[56:36] look how he's falling down his bodies.
[56:39] Anything can happen
[56:43] now.
[56:46] Even if I cross the road, they will
[56:48] knock you.
[56:50] These bodies are not yet.
[56:56] I cannot be tempted.
[56:58] Even if I go to the bar,
[57:02] &gt;&gt; you're going in the wrong place because
[57:04] you're living in these bodies,
[57:07] &gt;&gt; they can be subject to anything evil.
[57:12] So you have to be careful.
[57:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Even when
[57:17] you have the baptism of the Holy
[57:20] David was anointed.
[57:25] a man after God his own heart.
[57:28] But when he saw a naked woman bathing,
[57:33] sin took over.
[57:36] So you have to be careful.
[57:39] What do you watch?
[57:41] What do you hear? Who do you associate
[57:44] with? That's why the morning service,
[57:48] where is your communion?
[57:51] Are you communing with people who are
[57:54] unbelievers?
[57:56] You can't have communion with the Holy
[57:58] Spirit.
[58:00] What are you communing with?
[58:02] Who are your friends?
[58:05] Where do you spend most of your time?
[58:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So right
[58:13] now, we thank God.
[58:16] We have the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:19] that washes us from all sin
[58:24] that washes us from all evil.
[58:28] So you should desire all the time
[58:31] to stay under that blood.
[58:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Just stay
[58:36] under the blood.
[58:39] Remain under the blood.
[58:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us quot
[58:43] that quote communion.
[58:47] It says of 1965
[58:50] paragraph 41.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; So if you don't take it in sincerity,
[58:59] it's just a tradition.
[59:02] Well, our church observes communion
[59:04] every Sunday
[59:08] or every month or twice a year. And you
[59:12] go up and say, "Well, it's my time."
[59:16] And then take the communion.
[59:19] Why? It is a stink to God.
[59:23] It's just a tradition.
[59:26] Even like anything else.
[59:30] You've got to be sincere.
[59:33] God wants the depth of your heart.
[59:36] You remember the very God that brought
[59:40] here on earth.
[59:42] is the one you are serving.
[59:45] See, you are doing this because he said
[59:48] so
[59:51] because it is his order.
[59:54] Then we want to come up with the
[59:56] deepness of sincerity
[1:00:00] knowing that by God's grace
[1:00:04] that we have been saved
[1:00:06] and we love him and we filled his
[1:00:10] presence
[1:00:12] and we see change our lives.
[1:00:15] Our whole being
[1:00:19] is changed.
[1:00:25] We are different people.
[1:00:28] We don't live the way we used to.
[1:00:31] We don't think the way we used to.
[1:00:34] So what do you do? You do it in the
[1:00:37] depth of your heart.
[1:00:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us get
[1:00:42] back to 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:00:48] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:51] 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[1:00:55] and then in verse
[1:00:58] 23,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; for I have received of the Lord that
[1:01:03] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:01:05] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:01:08] was betrayed took bread.
[1:01:24] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[1:01:26] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:01:29] which is broken for you, and this do in
[1:01:32] remembrance of me."
[1:01:44] After the same manner also he took the
[1:01:46] cup when he had sed saying, "This is the
[1:01:48] cup of the new testament in my blood.
[1:01:50] This do as often as you drink it in
[1:01:53] remembrance of me.
[1:02:07] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:02:10] drink this cup, you do show the Lord his
[1:02:12] death till he come.
[1:02:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Then he
[1:02:29] says, "Wherefore, whosoever shall eat
[1:02:33] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:02:36] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:02:39] body and the blood of the Lord.
[1:02:53] Now in the message
[1:02:55] communion
[1:02:57] said we want just holiness among us
[1:03:03] that no filthy communications
[1:03:08] be heard among us at all
[1:03:13] as we profess this great calling of God.
[1:03:18] We must walk worthy
[1:03:21] of this thing that God has brought us to
[1:03:27] and we are well down towards the end of
[1:03:29] the journey. Now
[1:03:33] we are now expecting the exceeding
[1:03:35] abundant above all
[1:03:42] that we could do or think.
[1:03:46] And remember, we want to constantly be
[1:03:49] in prayer.
[1:03:52] And above all things,
[1:03:55] watch your life.
[1:03:58] Is if your life don't t up with God's
[1:04:01] holiness.
[1:04:04] Then go back and start praying again.
[1:04:09] There is something wrong. See, we must
[1:04:12] live in that kind of a state.
[1:04:16] that the fruits of the spirit
[1:04:18] will make itself known through us.
[1:04:22] That's what we want to live.
[1:04:25] You know sometime we hear great
[1:04:27] preachers who can preach mighty
[1:04:32] but we would rather see a sermon lived
[1:04:40] than we would one preached.
[1:04:45] because that's the evidence
[1:04:48] that God is on the inside.
[1:04:52] It's the life that you live. So we need
[1:04:56] to walk worthy,
[1:04:58] not only on Sunday, not only maybe where
[1:05:01] people know you,
[1:05:04] but you know all the time,
[1:05:06] even where they don't know you. live
[1:05:09] like Joseph.
[1:05:12] He knew God was there.
[1:05:14] So he had the fear of God. I'm not going
[1:05:17] through this thing and sin before my
[1:05:19] God.
[1:05:22] Even YouTube should be the same thing.
[1:05:25] And that shows that you are in a
[1:05:26] continuous communion with the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit.
[1:05:31] Even when nobody sees you, you want to
[1:05:34] be sincere.
[1:05:37] Praise the name of Lord. That's now
[1:05:39] walking worthy.
[1:05:42] But now if it is dodgy,
[1:05:45] you're not walking worthy.
[1:05:47] So you don't come to the table of the
[1:05:49] Lord
[1:05:51] because you are drinking of it or eating
[1:05:54] of it unworthily.
[1:05:57] But your work should be worthy.
[1:06:01] When I'm at my place of work, I seek to
[1:06:04] do what pleases the Lord.
[1:06:07] If I make a mistake, I run to the blood
[1:06:10] of Jesus Christ and then I say, "Lord,
[1:06:13] have mercy upon me." And then the Lord
[1:06:15] delivers me.
[1:06:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So then the
[1:06:19] Bible says in verse 27,
[1:06:23] okay, verse 28, "But let a man examine
[1:06:27] himself, and so let him eat that bread
[1:06:30] and drink of that cup.
[1:06:43] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:06:45] unworthily eatth and drinkkeeth
[1:06:47] damnation to himself discerning the
[1:06:50] Lord's
[1:07:04] So now he says you have to walk
[1:07:06] worthily.
[1:07:09] But if you are not worthy
[1:07:12] then you are drinking damnation to
[1:07:14] yourself.
[1:07:16] So you should be that you are walking
[1:07:18] worthy every day.
[1:07:22] Praise the name of our Lord to be able
[1:07:24] to partake of the Lord's supper.
[1:07:28] And if and if you are part of the body
[1:07:30] of Christ,
[1:07:32] why don't you want the Holy Ghost to
[1:07:34] flow there?
[1:07:36] Commun communion,
[1:07:39] you know the spirit of God is leading
[1:07:41] you. The spirit of God is guiding you.
[1:07:44] Then verse 30,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; for this cause
[1:07:48] many are weak and sickly among you, and
[1:07:51] many sleep.
[1:08:03] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:08:06] judged.
[1:08:13] But when we are judged, we are chastened
[1:08:16] of the Lord and that we should not be
[1:08:19] condemned with the world.
[1:08:31] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[1:08:33] some fall sick because they are not
[1:08:35] doing the right thing.
[1:08:39] Some become weak because they're not
[1:08:40] doing the right thing.
[1:08:42] Some die.
[1:08:46] So you shouldn't come when you're not
[1:08:49] worthy.
[1:08:50] Now none of us is worthy.
[1:08:54] Praise the name of none of us is worthy.
[1:08:58] But we only become worthy
[1:09:01] in the blood of Jesus.
[1:09:04] That's what makes us worthy.
[1:09:07] So now you call upon the name of the
[1:09:09] Lord.
[1:09:11] You confess to the Lord,
[1:09:13] Lord, this is where my faith is. Lord,
[1:09:16] this is where my weakness is. And then
[1:09:19] the blood of Jesus
[1:09:21] makes you worthy to partake of his body.
[1:09:25] That's what you should do. You wait on
[1:09:28] the Lord.
[1:09:30] Lord, have mercy upon him.
[1:09:33] Praise the name of our Lord. All your
[1:09:35] sin,
[1:09:37] all your trespasses,
[1:09:39] bring it under the blood.
[1:09:42] Praise the name of our Lord. Bring it
[1:09:44] under the blood.
[1:09:46] The blood shall never lose its power
[1:09:50] till the last elect is saved.
[1:09:53] Sin no more. Praise the name of our
[1:09:55] Lord. So you must be a personal.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; If you are going to take up the Lord's
[1:10:00] supper,
[1:10:02] you must have accepted the Lord Jesus as
[1:10:04] your person.
[1:10:07] You must have taken his name in water
[1:10:09] baptism
[1:10:11] and you must be walking worthy
[1:10:14] of the gospel that is preaching of the
[1:10:17] word of God. You are walking worthy.
[1:10:22] Whatever the Lord tells you to do, you
[1:10:25] are all the time. Lord, I'm doing. Lord,
[1:10:27] I'm going to do it. If I fail, Lord,
[1:10:31] have mercy upon me.
[1:10:33] Praise the name of our Lord. You bring
[1:10:35] your weakness under the blood of
[1:10:39] what makes you worthy.
[1:10:42] So when you come before him, you are
[1:10:44] washed.
[1:10:46] Praise the name of God. And then brother
[1:10:48] Brandham says
[1:10:50] that they walked for 40 years
[1:10:54] without anybody being weak
[1:10:57] because of the Passover.
[1:10:59] And now we have the Passover, our Lord
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:04] Everything we have need of
[1:11:07] fulfilled it in his body.
[1:11:09] So even when we come to the Lord's
[1:11:11] supper,
[1:11:14] those who are sick
[1:11:16] can be healed.
[1:11:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Those who
[1:11:20] are bound, they can be delivered.
[1:11:24] Those who need the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:25] Spirit can be filled with the Holy
[1:11:28] Spirit.
[1:11:29] Anything can happen. What are you doing?
[1:11:33] You are in obedience to the word of God.
[1:11:36] Praise the name of And that's what you
[1:11:39] should always seek to do.
[1:11:41] Lord, I seek to be obedient to your
[1:11:43] word. You know, the Bible says, be
[1:11:46] willing
[1:11:48] and obedient.
[1:11:51] Lord, I'm here. I'm willing and I'm
[1:11:54] here. Praise the name of God. And that
[1:11:57] makes you worthy.
[1:11:59] Not in my own. But Lord, I'm looking at
[1:12:02] you. I'm looking at the perfect
[1:12:05] sacrifice
[1:12:07] like the other publican went the temple
[1:12:09] to pray
[1:12:15] and then there was a Pharisee there.
[1:12:18] The publican bow his head to the earth
[1:12:24] and he said Lord have mercy upon me.
[1:12:29] Then the the Pharisee
[1:12:31] oh Lord
[1:12:35] Hey,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not like the other public there.
[1:12:41] Now, instead of looking at your
[1:12:43] troubles,
[1:12:45] he's looking at the other one. I pray I
[1:12:48] fast two times a I fast two times a
[1:12:50] week.
[1:12:53] I pay my taxes. I do everything, not
[1:12:57] like the other one. And then the Lord
[1:12:59] said the Pharisee went home
[1:13:03] not justified.
[1:13:06] But the publican went home
[1:13:09] justified. Why? Have mercy upon me Lord.
[1:13:14] He looked at the sacrifice.
[1:13:16] Even now we are looking at the
[1:13:19] sacrifice.
[1:13:20] The sacrifice that has been made for us
[1:13:24] to make us worthy.
[1:13:26] Not ourselves to be worthy.
[1:13:28] only under the blood of Jesus.
[1:13:31] That's where we are made worthy. That's
[1:13:34] how you come under the lord.
[1:13:38] I'm depending upon your grace.
[1:13:41] I'm depending upon you.
[1:13:44] I see that I've searched my life and I
[1:13:47] put everything under your blood.
[1:13:51] Then you come. Praise the name of our
[1:13:53] Lord. Then in verse 33,
[1:13:57] wherefore my brethren, when you come
[1:13:59] together to eat, t one for another.
[1:14:13] one another.
[1:14:15] You are interceding for one another.
[1:14:18] Lord, I pray for my brother. Lord, I
[1:14:21] pray for my sister. Forgive him their
[1:14:23] trespasses. Deliver them from this kind
[1:14:25] of deliver from this kind of praying for
[1:14:29] one another. You are ting.
[1:14:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So that you
[1:14:38] know the Lord can have his grace
[1:14:43] upon us.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:14:46] to walk worthy of the gospel
[1:14:51] every day.
[1:14:53] Bring all our things under the blood.
[1:14:58] Let us live under the blood of Jesus.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Let us bring our weaknesses under the
[1:15:03] blood.
[1:15:06] because he's the only one who
[1:15:09] praise the name of our Lord. Now that
[1:15:11] same night after the Lord's supper,
[1:15:16] he did the foot washing.
[1:15:19] Praise the name of our Lord in the book
[1:15:22] of John,
[1:15:26] chapter 13
[1:15:28] and then verse five.
[1:15:32] The scripture says
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; after that he pou water into basin and
[1:15:37] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:15:39] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:15:42] was guarded.
[1:15:54] Then cometh it to Simon Peter and says
[1:15:56] unto him, Lord, thou wash my feet?
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
[1:16:10] do, th knowest not now, but th shall
[1:16:14] know here after.
[1:16:24] Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt not
[1:16:27] wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I
[1:16:30] wash thee not, thou hast no part with
[1:16:33] me."
[1:16:43] If now Christ would tell Peter that
[1:16:47] about foot washing
[1:16:49] How about us now?
[1:16:51] So we need to be obedient to the word of
[1:16:53] the Lord.
[1:16:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Foot
[1:16:58] washing.
[1:17:02] See that you participate in what the
[1:17:04] Lord has told us to do.
[1:17:08] And you know like in the in the Middle
[1:17:10] East,
[1:17:13] you know, because when Jesus was talking
[1:17:15] to Peter here,
[1:17:18] Let us continue in the scriptures.
[1:17:23] In the scriptures here, let us go to
[1:17:26] verse
[1:17:28] verse 10.
[1:17:31] Jesus said unto him, he that is washed
[1:17:34] needeth not to wash his feet, but is
[1:17:38] clean every week, and you are clean, but
[1:17:40] not all.
[1:17:54] For he knew who should betray him.
[1:17:56] Therefore he said you are not all clean.
[1:18:06] Now he said you're not all clean.
[1:18:10] Meaning Judah escarot
[1:18:14] You're not clean.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; What was Judas Scariot doing?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:18:22] go to Mark rather let us go to Luke
[1:18:27] chapter 22.
[1:18:32] Luke chapter 22
[1:18:35] and then we read
[1:18:39] verse three.
[1:18:41] The Bible says
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; then entered Satan into Judah's Escariot
[1:18:49] being the number of the 12.
[1:19:01] And he went his way and communed with
[1:19:05] the chief priests and the captains how
[1:19:08] he might betro him unto them. And they
[1:19:12] were glad and confidented to give him
[1:19:14] money.
[1:19:26] Now he went and covenanted.
[1:19:32] He went and communed.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of us. And we're talking
[1:19:38] about communion.
[1:19:41] What do you commune with? See Judah
[1:19:44] escarot here.
[1:19:46] Communing.
[1:19:48] Satan entered him.
[1:19:51] Then he commune
[1:19:53] with people who are demon possessed.
[1:19:57] And then he comes the lord.
[1:20:02] Now in verse 19
[1:20:09] okay let us start from verse 21
[1:20:14] but behold the hand of him that betroth
[1:20:16] me is with me on the table
[1:20:23] is communing here with the devil
[1:20:26] and those who are going to kill
[1:20:29] and then he's coming to commune with the
[1:20:30] Lord of
[1:20:33] unworthy.
[1:20:36] We shouldn't do like that.
[1:20:39] I spent the weekend in the nightclub
[1:20:43] and I've not repented about it.
[1:20:48] Nobody knows my secret life.
[1:20:52] I spent weekend doing something
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; like now those of Elvis Priestley
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Elvis Priley
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; spend night on nightclubs
[1:21:12] clubs
[1:21:14] those shows
[1:21:17] you know on on those live life live
[1:21:20] bands
[1:21:22] Then on Sunday they in the choir
[1:21:26] singing
[1:21:30] Jesus loves me
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; in the night worshippping devils
[1:21:35] on Sunday worshiping God communion
[1:21:40] communing with devils
[1:21:42] and you are communing here with God.
[1:21:45] You are serving the table of devils.
[1:21:50] Now you're coming. The Lord is stable.
[1:21:52] You shouldn't walk like that. That's
[1:21:54] unworthy.
[1:21:56] This was
[1:21:58] he had finished communing with the
[1:22:00] Pharisees.
[1:22:04] I know him and I will give him
[1:22:08] this time. You will do it.
[1:22:11] He also comes
[1:22:16] our light. So then the Lord Jesus says,
[1:22:19] "You are all clean."
[1:22:22] What made them clean? The word
[1:22:26] which he spoke made them clean. Praise
[1:22:30] the name of our Lord. Because the Bible
[1:22:32] says we are clean by the word of God.
[1:22:38] Now in John 17:1 17,
[1:22:42] he says, "Sanctify them through thy
[1:22:45] truth.
[1:22:47] Thy word is truth."
[1:22:51] So when you hear the word of God and
[1:22:53] obey the word of God, it makes you
[1:22:56] clean. It makes you worthy.
[1:23:00] But now when you don't obey the word of
[1:23:02] God,
[1:23:04] you are not worthy.
[1:23:06] You are not clean.
[1:23:08] because you you refuse to wash
[1:23:12] the water is here
[1:23:14] but when you go to wash
[1:23:17] like I'm told in some of the boarding
[1:23:19] schools
[1:23:23] they use perfumes
[1:23:27] can take a month without bathing
[1:23:35] disguising the other false smell
[1:23:42] Now we need to bathe
[1:23:46] by the word of God.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. But Judas
[1:23:51] scariot
[1:23:53] for him he was refusing to bathe.
[1:23:56] So he was not clean.
[1:24:00] So Jesus was telling them you are all
[1:24:03] clean but one Jud scared he's communing
[1:24:08] with devils
[1:24:10] is not part of me but it's part of the
[1:24:13] other people. So he was not worthy but
[1:24:17] we need to be worthy.
[1:24:19] Praise the name of our lord. So now foot
[1:24:21] washing
[1:24:23] they were washing from outside
[1:24:26] a bathroom outside like in most of our
[1:24:28] villages.
[1:24:31] So after bathing you walk to the house
[1:24:34] but when you reach at the doorstep your
[1:24:37] feet have gathered some dirt.
[1:24:40] So you have to get water and clean that.
[1:24:44] So when we come for foot washing
[1:24:49] we don't come with brushes scrubbing
[1:24:52] brush.
[1:24:55] We don't do that.
[1:25:02] Praise the name of
[1:25:05] So you come to observe. And the
[1:25:08] significance of it is to turn for one
[1:25:12] another.
[1:25:14] You humble yourself.
[1:25:16] I will keep you in my prayers. I will
[1:25:19] keep you in my prayers.
[1:25:21] when I see you doing wrong, I'll come
[1:25:24] and tell you my brother. But some other
[1:25:26] people don't want to admit when they
[1:25:27] being told they're wrong.
[1:25:31] But that's the whole thing. Be your
[1:25:34] brother's keeper.
[1:25:37] That's the significance.
[1:25:39] Pray for me. Pray for me. Encourage me.
[1:25:43] I'll encourage me. Correct me here. I'll
[1:25:46] also correct you here. And we move as
[1:25:49] the body of Jesus.
[1:25:51] Praise the name of our Lord. We wash
[1:25:53] each other's feet.
[1:25:56] Praise the name of our Lord. And so
[1:25:58] Peter told the Lord, you are not going
[1:26:01] to wash my feet. Jesus told them, if I
[1:26:05] don't wash your feet, then you are not
[1:26:08] part of me.
[1:26:10] So we need to be part of these things.
[1:26:14] Praise the name of our Lord. Now back to
[1:26:16] John chapter 13.
[1:26:19] And then verse 14,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:26:24] washed your feet, you ought also to wash
[1:26:27] one another's feet.
[1:26:39] you an example that you should do as I
[1:26:42] have done to you.
[1:26:50] Very I say unto you, the servant is not
[1:26:53] greater than his Lord, neither he that
[1:26:56] is sent greater than he that sent him.
[1:27:07] If you know these things, happy are you
[1:27:10] if you do them.
[1:27:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[1:27:17] desire to do what the Lord wants us to
[1:27:19] do.
[1:27:21] As often as you would
[1:27:25] do it. Now in 1 Timothy chapter 5
[1:27:30] and then verse 9,
[1:27:32] the Bible says, "Let not a widow be
[1:27:36] taken into the number under three score
[1:27:39] years old, having been the wife of one
[1:27:41] man.
[1:27:56] well reported all for good works. If she
[1:27:59] have been brought up children, and if
[1:28:02] she have loded strangers, if she have
[1:28:04] watched the saints feet, if she have tra
[1:28:08] relieved the afflicted, if she have
[1:28:10] diligently followed every good work,
[1:28:17] Fore!
[1:28:22] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:28:45] Now you see that foot washing
[1:28:47] was one of the qualifications
[1:28:51] to show that this person is walking
[1:28:52] right
[1:28:55] if she has washed the saint's feet.
[1:29:01] that done during the Lord's supper.
[1:29:05] So we need to be observing it.
[1:29:08] Now in the message questions and
[1:29:10] answers,
[1:29:12] he says over in second Timothy,
[1:29:15] Paul said, writing to the church,
[1:29:19] don't let a widow be brought into the
[1:29:21] church
[1:29:24] until she has washed the saint's feet.
[1:29:28] That is right. Feet washing
[1:29:32] was observed all through the Bible days
[1:29:37] and go by God's help.
[1:29:41] If I keep my right mind
[1:29:46] and God helps me, I will observe it till
[1:29:50] I die.
[1:29:52] That is right. It is exactly a
[1:29:55] commission of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[1:30:00] should always desire,
[1:30:03] Lord, let me do what you've told me.
[1:30:06] Let me do your will. I want to do your
[1:30:09] will, Lord. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:30:12] And we participate in the Lord's supper.
[1:30:15] You participate in the foot washing.
[1:30:18] Praise the name of our Lord. And here
[1:30:19] God has given us a privilege
[1:30:22] that we have the facilities to use.
[1:30:26] Praise the name of our Lord. We have the
[1:30:28] facilities to use.
[1:30:30] They are enough.
[1:30:32] So you really can't have any reason.
[1:30:36] But then there are places you go to. You
[1:30:38] have only one person.
[1:30:41] So all others have to wait and then you
[1:30:44] there's a place we did it I think up to
[1:30:46] one.
[1:30:50] You have to wait for that one person.
[1:30:52] One thing
[1:30:57] yet Sunday you have to come back for
[1:31:02] you know different things but here God
[1:31:05] has given us bread
[1:31:08] we have our running water there
[1:31:10] so you're not going go to the well
[1:31:14] and when we have our water here why do
[1:31:17] you want to use one liter
[1:31:22] praise the name of our lord So we need
[1:31:24] to see that we participate in it
[1:31:27] as the Lord has given us the ability.
[1:31:30] Praise the name of our may God bless
[1:31:32] you.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Let us sing this song.
[1:31:44] When we all get to heaven as the song
[1:31:46] leader comes.
[1:31:51] When we all
[1:31:54] get to heaven,
[1:31:59] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:32:07] when we
[1:32:10] see Jesus
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:16] and shout the victory.
[1:32:32] I
[1:32:35] heard
[1:32:39] bright and blessing.
[1:32:43] You prepare for us up when we all when
[1:32:49] we all
[1:32:53] get to.
[1:32:57] What a day of rejoicing that will be.
[1:33:04] Oh, when we all
[1:33:08] see Jesus,
[1:33:12] he'll sing and shout of victory.
[1:33:18] Oh, there is a river of life flowing out
[1:33:24] of me.
[1:33:27] makes the lame to go and the blind to
[1:33:33] see.

[1:33:41] free.
