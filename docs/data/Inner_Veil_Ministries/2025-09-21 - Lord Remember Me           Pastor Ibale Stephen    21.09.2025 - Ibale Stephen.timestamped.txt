[10:49] because his voice was heard loud. His

[10:56] that it is finished.
[10:58] Let us sing that song.
[11:04] The projector is not supporting us but
[11:07] we are going to sing it just a chorus.
[11:12] It says I'm happy.
[11:16] for the resurrection morning.
[11:20] There is a verse which uh excites me a
[11:23] lot.
[11:26] He wrote and said, "If Christ be not
[11:28] risen
[11:32] then my faith I don't know it would have
[11:35] been on veil."
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So we are happy
[11:42] because he rose.
[11:48] [Music]
[11:52] &gt;&gt; I am so happy for the resurrection.
[11:57] [Music]
[11:58] Sorry the key is not favoring.
[12:01] Get me some good key.
[12:06] [Music]
[12:08] I am so happy for the resurrection
[12:13] morning
[12:15] when God raised up Jesus
[12:19] from the grave
[12:23] to bring light
[12:26] to the seed of God
[12:31] that we who are darkness
[12:35] may have. I'm so happy. I am so happy
[12:41] for the resurrection
[12:44] morning
[12:46] when God raised up Jesus
[12:50] Christ from the dead
[12:54] to bring light to the seed
[12:59] of God.
[13:02] that we who when darkness
[13:06] may have a once again. Oh, I am so
[13:12] happy.
[13:14] resurrection morning
[13:17] when God raised up Jesus
[13:21] Christ from the grave

[13:33] that we who in darkness
[13:37] may have the last time. Oh, I am so
[13:43] happy.
[13:45] resurrection

[13:53] Christ from the grave

[14:04] that we who in darkness
[14:08] may have a life.
[14:13] As we usher in the pastor,

[14:20] "Glory, glory, hallelujah."

[16:20] [Music]
[16:24] Precious heavenly father,
[16:28] we give thanks and honor to you
[16:32] Lord for the grace that you have given
[16:34] to us
[16:37] to come before your presence.
[16:41] We just want to commit this day
[16:45] into your presence Lord
[16:48] that you may walk with us
[16:52] in the thought that you have given to us
[16:55] today.
[16:58] Be a blessing to us
[17:00] to the glory of your holy name
[17:04] in Jesus name.
[17:07] Amen.
[17:13] So I greet you in the precious name of
[17:15] our Lord Jesus.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; And uh
[17:24] I trust by the grace of God
[17:29] that God will speak to us today.
[17:35] Amen. Amen. So I'll invite a song
[17:41] from the young people
[17:44] &gt;&gt; before we go into the reading of the
[17:46] word.
[18:00] You receive what you expect
[18:06] when you come to the house of the Lord.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; You you expect a blessing.
[18:15] You always get a blessing.
[18:18] Amen. Amen. Now,
[18:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Life can have so many crossroads.
[18:46] I find myself sometimes
[18:49] that I'm standing at the Red Sea
[18:54] and Pharaoh's bearing down.
[18:58] I have no board to flee across. So I
[19:03] raise this stuff for faith and I cry
[19:07] out, "Oh Lord, remember me."
[19:14] When I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[19:19] when I'm losing my way.
[19:23] When I'm down on my knees,
[19:27] Lord.
[19:29] Oh Lord, remember me
[19:36] when I'm down in the valley. Lord,
[19:40] when I'm losing my way,
[19:44] when I'm down on my knees,
[19:48] Lord,
[19:51] oh Lord, remember me.
[19:58] Sometimes I take the wrong road and I
[20:02] let the devil know
[20:06] that when you cut my prayer,
[20:10] I'm as powerless as any man. But like
[20:15] Samson in the dungeon,
[20:19] I'm blinded
[20:21] and scared.
[20:23] And I still cry out, "Lord, remember me,
[20:31] when I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[20:35] when I'm losing my way.
[20:40] When I'm down on my knees,
[20:44] Lord.
[20:46] Oh Lord, remember me.
[20:53] Like Hana in the temple,
[20:57] like Jabus, will you bless me?
[21:01] Like Joseph in a foreign
[21:04] land.
[21:07] Oh Lord, remember me
[21:12] [Music]
[21:14] like the three
[21:16] children, Lord. Like Daniel in the den
[21:20] of lions,
[21:22] I'm praying
[21:24] in Gethsemane.
[21:27] Lord,
[21:28] [Music]
[21:30] remember me
[21:34] when I'm down in the valley. Lord,
[21:39] when I'm losing my way,
[21:43] when I'm down on my knees,
[21:47] Lord,
[21:49] oh Lord, remember me.
[21:56] Like the thief on the cross,
[22:00] I'm at the end of my rope.
[22:04] But I know within my heart that my soul
[22:10] is a part of you.
[22:13] I know that I was there
[22:17] when the stars of the morning sun
[22:21] when you come into your kingom. Remember
[22:25] me.
[22:28] Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[22:33] &gt;&gt; when I'm losing my way,
[22:37] remember when I'm down on my knees,
[22:41] Lord.
[22:44] Oh Lord, remember me
[22:50] like the thief from the cross.
[22:54] I'm at the end of my rope,
[22:58] but I know within my heart that my soul
[23:04] is a part of you.
[23:07] I know that I was there
[23:11] when the stars of the morning sun.
[23:15] So when you come into your kingdom,
[23:19] remember me.
[23:23] Oh, when I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[23:28] when I'm losing my way,
[23:32] when I'm down on my knees,
[23:36] Lord,
[23:38] oh Lord, remember me
[23:45] when I'm down in the valley, Lord,
[23:49] when I'm losing my way.
[23:54] when I'm down on my knees,
[23:58] Lord.
[24:00] Oh Lord, remember me.
[24:07] So when you come into your kingdom,
[24:11] remember me.
[24:17] [Music]
[24:18] [Applause]
[24:22] Praise the Lord.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Lord remember.
[24:29] Amen. Amen. How many of you say Lord
[24:31] remember?
[24:35] &gt;&gt; You never remember what you never heard.
[24:39] Amen. Amen. So the thief at the cross
[24:44] said, "Lord,
[24:47] remember
[24:50] he got a revelation
[24:52] that was part of the economy of God."
[24:57] Amen. Amen. So you are welcome to the
[24:59] house of the Lord
[25:01] and I trust that the Lord has been so
[25:04] good to you
[25:06] through the week since you are in the
[25:08] house of the Lord
[25:11] and I trust that you are looking forward
[25:13] for his grace and mercy.
[25:18] Sometimes God does things when you least
[25:21] expect them.
[25:25] Amen. Amen. when you least expect that
[25:28] God
[25:31] is going to do something for you.
[25:34] And that's today.
[25:38] God is going to do something for you.
[25:43] Amen. Amen. Just be expectant
[25:47] and be in the mood
[25:49] and say, "Lord,
[25:52] I am here."
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just like the thief at the
[25:56] cross,
[25:58] just remember me.
[26:00] You don't bring any plea to him.
[26:08] You know, just say, "Lord, remember me."
[26:12] Each time people were at the last string
[26:14] of life,
[26:18] that's when they called for the Lord.
[26:23] Sometimes in our Christian walk,
[26:27] we get a little bit tired.
[26:32] And at that time,
[26:34] when you are tired and there is a he to
[26:40] say, Lord, remember
[26:43] amen. Amen.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; So, we are happy to be here today.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and u uh sister provi
[26:54] family
[26:54] &gt;&gt; sister
[26:57] uh she has lost uh a sister
[27:02] &gt;&gt; and so they are not here with us today
[27:06] and the family of GJ also
[27:09] they are not here with us today
[27:12] but still we trust that the Lord will be
[27:15] gracious
[27:17] and reach reach them.
[27:21] Amen. Amen. They are not feeling well
[27:23] today.
[27:25] But God is gracious.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Do you have anything you have need of
[27:29] from the Lord this morning?
[27:32] Just keep your hands open
[27:36] to receive from the Lord.
[27:39] Let us stand up and get into St. Luke
[27:42] chapter 23.
[27:46] And before we read the word,
[27:49] Let us pray.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father,
[27:53] we pray today
[27:56] that you may accept us in your presence.
[28:00] And we pray that your grace
[28:03] may help our hearts to keep open
[28:06] that we may receive your word
[28:09] and have the liberty to store it
[28:12] anywhere in our souls
[28:15] because we need it. along this prim
[28:18] journey.
[28:20] Bless your children, the need ones that
[28:23] have come to feed.
[28:26] Feed them, Lord. Sick that you may heal
[28:29] them.
[28:31] And those who are thirsty.
[28:33] We pray that you may baptize them with
[28:36] the bosom of the Holy Ghost. We need you
[28:39] today Lord more than ever before
[28:43] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[28:47] So St. Luke 23:42
[28:53] Jesus
[28:55] is at the cross
[28:58] and on his left and on his right
[29:02] there are thieves
[29:04] &gt;&gt; that are hanging right there.
[29:08] So he's dying between male factors
[29:13] and that's now one of them was
[29:16] criticizing him.
[29:19] But one of them rebuked his friend
[29:24] and says we are here for a right cause.
[29:28] The wages of sin is death.
[29:32] But this man has done nothing.
[29:37] And this man turned to Jesus
[29:41] and he said unto Jesus,
[29:44] &gt;&gt; "Lord, remember me
[29:47] when thou comest in thy kingdom."
[29:52] So this man is putting his hope far
[29:55] away.
[29:58] But Jesus answered and said unto him,
[30:02] "Verily I say unto thee,
[30:06] today thou shalt be with me in
[30:09] paradise."
[30:11] Not when the kingdom comes.
[30:15] But that's how powerful
[30:18] the blood is.
[30:20] Right today, you'll be with me in
[30:23] paradise.
[30:25] May the Lord had bless in the reading of
[30:27] his word.
[30:29] So I today
[30:32] I have come to talk to the thief on the
[30:34] cross.
[30:38] The man who sometimes seems like he has
[30:40] come to the end of himself.
[30:45] Amen. So I want to talk to those
[30:49] who have thought
[30:51] like this could be their last church
[30:53] service
[30:56] unless God came out for them.
[31:01] I mean I'm talking to desperate souls.
[31:07] I'm talking about those who have been
[31:09] fighting
[31:12] to remain up.
[31:15] The devil wants to push them down.
[31:18] I want us to talk together. I mean, walk
[31:21] together.
[31:23] Amen.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; All the way from Calvary.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; To our victory in Christ.
[31:32] Amen. Amen. So where the lamb you know
[31:36] was hanging out there
[31:41] and the whole world was in a state of
[31:44] gloom.
[31:47] But somehow somewhere,
[31:50] there was one man
[31:52] of all the entire world
[31:56] that had been able to gain the grace of
[31:58] God
[32:01] at the last minute of his life.
[32:04] Amen. And this man here
[32:08] is granted
[32:11] the grace
[32:13] literally
[32:14] when the blood was flowing.
[32:19] The blood of atonement
[32:22] to atone for the condition
[32:26] that had bothered all his life.
[32:29] Amen. So I'm going to take time
[32:33] And I want to go with you
[32:36] all the way from the cross
[32:39] to fellowship with him.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. All the way from the habits that
[32:44] bind us
[32:47] to the moment when we can say yes, we
[32:50] have fellowship with him.
[32:54] Moses in Leviticus 17:11,
[32:59] he spoke a New Testament scripture.
[33:05] And he says, "For the life of the flesh,
[33:11] is in the blood.
[33:14] And I have given you that life
[33:19] upon the altar."
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The life
[33:24] is in the blood.
[33:27] But for you to have access to that life,
[33:32] you have to get the lamb
[33:35] and get it slain at the altar.
[33:39] Amen. So as long as you have got the
[33:42] lamb
[33:44] and the lamb has never been slain in
[33:46] your life,
[33:49] you don't have life.
[33:52] Amen.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; The life behind the perfect sacrifice
[33:57] was in the in the blood.
[34:00] And when released
[34:03] on the out of sacrifice,
[34:06] that life in the blood
[34:09] would flow into the soul of a man
[34:14] and bring a new birth unto him.
[34:19] by that new I mean by that life.
[34:24] So it's by the DNA
[34:28] in the blood that we can have a genetic
[34:32] inheritance.
[34:33] [Music]
[34:36] Amen. The character of the parent
[34:41] is in the blood.
[34:43] And at the cross,
[34:45] Christ released the image
[34:49] and likeness
[34:51] that man had lost
[34:54] at the fall. So that life was the image
[35:00] and likeness of God
[35:04] which Adam lost in the form.
[35:08] So God
[35:10] took the body of a man.
[35:13] Amen. And because of the blood
[35:17] which was not the blood of a man
[35:21] but the blood of God,
[35:23] he went to the cross
[35:26] release that life back to man again.
[35:31] So Christ at the cross
[35:33] is releasing the light
[35:36] behind the blood.
[35:39] He was our sin offering
[35:43] and besides him
[35:45] there were two men.
[35:50] Amen. On the left and on the right one
[35:55] mocked the sacrifice at the cross.
[36:00] mocked.
[36:04] Amen. Like they mock the preaching of
[36:07] the cross
[36:11] and they call it foolishness.
[36:14] But unto us
[36:16] which are saved,
[36:19] that foolishness of preaching of the
[36:21] cross
[36:24] is the power of God unto us
[36:28] to salvation.
[36:30] Look at that par. Now
[36:33] at the cross there was a man who was
[36:37] criticizing Christ.
[36:40] But on the other side,
[36:43] there is a man that had been able to
[36:46] recognize
[36:48] that much as he's dying a malf,
[36:54] he has got the ability
[36:57] to remember me when he comes in.
[37:01] Amen. Amen. So it always depends on what
[37:04] attitude you have towards the word.
[37:08] If you have got a negative attitude,
[37:12] the word will not benefit you.
[37:15] If you've got a positive attitude,
[37:18] there is enough power
[37:20] to redeem the thief at the cross this
[37:22] morning.
[37:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So in the
[37:28] blood is instant power
[37:33] that recreates a repentant sin.
[37:39] into sons and daughters of God.
[37:44] God
[37:45] &gt;&gt; gave that fish
[37:48] the right words to say,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; "Lord,
[37:52] remember me."
[37:55] Lord,
[37:57] remember me. And we know very well
[38:01] that there is, you know, the lamb's book
[38:04] of life.
[38:06] And the names were put there
[38:11] before the foundation of the world.
[38:14] And you know when you are a child of God
[38:18] from before the foundation of the world,
[38:22] there will always be a still small voice
[38:26] that speaks behind.
[38:29] Each time you did wrong
[38:32] or you do wrong.
[38:35] Amen. There is a voice that reminds you
[38:39] you are supposed to be a son of God.
[38:42] Other than that, Amen. But that voice
[38:45] never die
[38:47] and that voice never gives up on
[38:51] that voice never gave up on the thing.
[38:55] Amen. Whenever I did anything wrong,
[38:59] there was a whisper that you are
[39:02] supposed to be a son of God.
[39:05] And you are not supposed to do what you
[39:07] are doing.
[39:09] Amen. And so this man here, he knew
[39:13] somehow somewhere
[39:15] I must be belonging to an economy.
[39:20] Amen. I must be somewhere in the lamb's
[39:23] book of life.
[39:27] And God inspired him to say the right
[39:30] word.
[39:32] Lord
[39:33] remember me.
[39:36] And that's our title this morning.
[39:40] Lord
[39:42] remember me. Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; You see that's nothing other than the
[39:46] revelation
[39:49] to know that he was a part
[39:52] of God's divine economy.
[39:57] He knew his name must be somewhere
[40:01] on the last book of life.
[40:05] There was a seed gene of life in him
[40:09] which was totally soiled with evil and
[40:12] wickedness.
[40:15] And when that seed came next to Christ,
[40:20] the darkness began to wash away.
[40:24] Are you together with me? The darkness
[40:26] began to wash away.
[40:29] And then this man here
[40:35] came out with the right thing.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[40:40] remember me. He felt like he was acting
[40:44] to him.
[40:48] Amen. He started feeling such a
[40:51] closeness.
[40:54] Amen. Amen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; And the liberty
[40:57] &gt;&gt; to pray.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; There was something telling him, "You
[41:03] are supposed to be a son of God."
[41:06] He felt that liberty
[41:09] and he said, "Let me pray for eternal
[41:12] life.
[41:14] Let me ask you for eternal life. It's
[41:18] never too late."
[41:20] Amen. Because that voice
[41:24] lives with a thief.
[41:31] Amen. If he lives in the life of a drug
[41:35] addict
[41:38] is only crowded by a darkness.
[41:43] But there is a seed of life in him.
[41:47] Hallelujah. And once you keep coming
[41:50] closer to Christ,
[41:53] you are going to discover who you are.
[41:57] Hallelujah.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; The negative life you have lived so long
[42:03] may sometimes give you a wrong
[42:05] impression,
[42:08] that you cannot meet your atonement,
[42:12] that you cannot be saved,
[42:15] that you cannot be forgiven.
[42:17] words and whispers of the devil.
[42:21] But God holds your victory
[42:25] in his own heart.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even this morning,
[42:31] &gt;&gt; even this morning is waiting for the
[42:34] thief to say,
[42:36] "Lord, remember me."
[42:41] to come to a point
[42:43] where you feel like you've tried the
[42:45] best you can
[42:48] but you have come to the end of yourself
[42:52] and whenever you feel you come to the
[42:54] end of yourself
[42:57] then you need to call to the
[42:58] supernatural
[43:01] because you have to overcome the enemy
[43:05] to begin with he's a liar
[43:11] Amen. Because when Jesus says come unto
[43:14] me,
[43:16] all the mess of your past
[43:22] will tell you.
[43:24] That's a call
[43:26] to another man.
[43:31] It's not you.
[43:33] You are too dirty
[43:35] to go to him.
[43:40] He says come unto me.
[43:43] You look at yourself.
[43:46] You can never wash yourself.
[43:49] When he says come unto me is because he
[43:52] wants to wash you.
[43:55] Amen. So don't look at yourself.
[43:59] When he says come unto me,
[44:02] take a step and go to him.
[44:06] Amen. The man said,
[44:09] "Lord, remember me, when you come in
[44:13] your kingdom."
[44:15] And Christ responded to him the with the
[44:19] power
[44:21] &gt;&gt; that works in the blood.
[44:24] And that power is instant.
[44:28] Hallelujah. It doesn't wait for
[44:31] tomorrow.
[44:32] That power is instant.
[44:36] with the except that even now
[44:39] somebody's life can be transformed.
[44:44] Yeah. Because there is enough power
[44:48] in that blood to give a new birth.
[44:54] When he stands before you, he introduces
[44:57] himself
[44:59] and he says, "I am the resurrection and
[45:01] the life.
[45:04] He doesn't say I will be.
[45:07] He says I am.
[45:10] He holds the power
[45:13] on his presence.
[45:15] Not tomorrow. I will be. Not yesterday.
[45:20] I was but today. Amen. I am the
[45:25] resurrection and the life.
[45:27] It was so instant
[45:30] for the thief on the cross. Remember
[45:34] friends, it was so instant
[45:38] for Saul when he was going to Damascus
[45:43] breathing with anger
[45:46] to go and kill.
[45:48] That power is so instant
[45:52] that on one instant
[45:55] he was a murderer
[45:58] and then the next second
[46:01] he was an apostle.
[46:03] That's how the power of God works.
[46:07] Amen. Don't look at yourself.
[46:10] Look at the one who is calling you this
[46:12] morning.
[46:14] It was instant
[46:16] for Cornelius
[46:18] when the Holy Ghost baptized this church
[46:22] even before the water baptism.
[46:25] That's what God does. That power so
[46:29] instant.
[46:31] Amen. When the sons of hatrite,
[46:35] Amen were out there playing and mocking.
[46:40] But that power
[46:42] in the blood on an instant
[46:46] brought them under conviction
[46:49] and they were born again.
[46:52] Amen. Christ says today shalt thou be
[46:58] with me in paradise.
[47:01] The atonement
[47:03] is instant
[47:06] in its effect.
[47:08] Amen. That's what it is. So we shall
[47:12] take the subject of the feast
[47:15] and walk with him
[47:18] from from remember me
[47:22] to remembering the Lord.
[47:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here he says
[47:28] Lord remember me.
[47:31] But we want to go with him
[47:34] until we come to remembering the Lord
[47:40] &gt;&gt; that he remembered you.
[47:43] You must remember him.
[47:47] Hallelujah.
[47:48] Praise the Lord. So revelation
[47:52] was released with thief on the cross
[47:56] that he was not a son of pition
[48:01] though he had robbed all his life.
[48:04] He was not a son of pition.
[48:07] I want to go into the message of grace
[48:11] and in between there you'll just be able
[48:13] to pick what I want.
[48:16] I've pulled off a little bit from up and
[48:18] down.
[48:20] He says, "How could that thief help
[48:24] himself?"
[48:28] Did you hear brother's question?
[48:32] &gt;&gt; How could that thief help himself?
[48:37] If you are failing,
[48:40] how can you help yourself?
[48:44] You are like a thief
[48:46] that was at the cross. That's what the
[48:49] young people have been singing.
[48:52] Like a thief at the cross.
[48:55] You need revelation to release you from
[48:58] that condition.
[49:01] Amen. No more than Adam could help
[49:04] himself.
[49:06] No more than Eve could help us.
[49:10] No more than you can help yourself.
[49:14] No more than I can help myself.
[49:18] The sovereignity of the grace of God
[49:23] come to the dying thief
[49:27] today shalt thou be with me in paradise.
[49:33] The prophet says, "Think of it,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; you
[49:39] who was robbed all the years,
[49:43] you are so evil,
[49:46] but grace
[49:48] say today, you'll be with me."
[49:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is sovereign
[49:55] grace
[49:57] from a sovereign one.
[50:00] You cannot question grace.
[50:06] If it chooses to save you,
[50:09] it has chosen to save you. Whether you
[50:13] are a thief on the cross
[50:16] today, you can be with me in paradise.
[50:22] So at the end of the road,
[50:25] he realized
[50:28] he had lived his life wrong.
[50:32] And if we have also lived our lives
[50:34] wrong,
[50:37] this is the chance
[50:39] for the open door.
[50:43] It's the chance for the open door.
[50:47] Amen. Deep down in your heart,
[50:52] There is a living cautious.
[50:56] There is a rebuke
[50:59] to the sinful life.
[51:02] And he say we are worth the death
[51:08] because the wages of sin is death.
[51:12] But what has this man done?
[51:16] The weight of sin was weighing on this
[51:19] man.
[51:22] to the extent that he had accepted
[51:26] the wages of sin.
[51:29] Amen. So don't take the rebuke
[51:33] that always talks to your heart lightly.
[51:38] You must respond to the rebuke
[51:42] with only three words.
[51:45] Lord, remember me. Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Lord
[51:51] remember me.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; When it comes from the bottom of your
[51:56] heart,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; you are testifying
[52:01] that I believe
[52:03] I have been part
[52:06] of the lamb's book of life.
[52:09] Amen. So the thief was a seed
[52:14] with the name on the lamb's book of
[52:16] life.
[52:19] And when the lamb met him,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[52:23] &gt;&gt; he was able to recognize him.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; There is a way God worked.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That when Jesus
[52:36] met this man
[52:39] knew who he was and when this man here
[52:43] met Christ, there was something in him.
[52:48] that was saying this is a holy man. This
[52:52] is a perfect man. I wish I was like him.
[52:56] He did not have an understanding
[52:58] of who exactly was but he was saying
[53:03] this man is different from who I am.
[53:07] Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; There is something when you come to
[53:12] church
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and you come to the presence of the
[53:17] word,
[53:18] you feel like you are a king to the
[53:21] word.
[53:24] When the word talks to you,
[53:27] but the problem is the voice of the
[53:30] thief
[53:32] which says that no, you cannot be set
[53:35] free.
[53:39] The power in the blood
[53:42] I want tell you it is instant.
[53:45] It dissolves the sinner's nature
[53:48] instantly
[53:51] and identifies him with eternal life.
[53:57] Are you together with me? This man here
[54:01] did not have to go through a training
[54:05] to discover he was a son of God.
[54:09] He was not taken through a catechism
[54:12] class.
[54:15] When revelation strikes,
[54:18] strikes immediately.
[54:21] It is so instant
[54:24] that you don't have to argue with
[54:26] anybody.
[54:28] Understand who you are.
[54:30] You understand what I mean? Because God
[54:34] deals with the seed of life.
[54:42] Are you together with me?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Now this takes us to our scripture in
[54:47] John 5:24.
[54:52] He says, "Verily, verily I say unto you,
[54:59] He that heareth my word
[55:04] and believeth on him that sent me
[55:08] &gt;&gt; is because
[55:11] he has everlasting life.
[55:16] You hear, you believe because new there
[55:21] is everlasting life.
[55:27] There is a dramatized seed.
[55:32] Amen. Just like a grain of corn,
[55:37] if it's not dramatized,
[55:41] it will never rise,
[55:43] no matter how much fertilizer you put on
[55:45] it.
[55:49] But if it's
[55:52] if it has got a life in it,
[55:55] The moment it drops into the ground,
[55:59] it begins the process of germination.
[56:02] Hallelujah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And this is what I believe. You as a son
[56:07] and daughter of God the moment you come
[56:10] into the presence in the atmosphere of
[56:13] the world. There is something in you
[56:17] that begins to pop up.
[56:20] Hallelujah.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:23] When the thief believed,
[56:26] he was justified
[56:28] like he never did it to me.
[56:32] And he became a candidate
[56:35] for the rapture immediately.
[56:41] Are you together with me? Immediately
[56:44] he became a candidate
[56:47] for the rapture.
[56:49] Amen. And even told him
[56:53] take you to the waiting lodge.
[56:56] Amen. Into the paradise.
[56:59] Because when the rapture comes, simply
[57:02] because you have received what instantly
[57:07] you become a candidate
[57:10] for the rapture.
[57:13] When we open for Christ,
[57:16] we are justified
[57:18] by faith on the instant.
[57:22] Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; You see, justification
[57:28] does not have a process or a period.
[57:32] Are you together with me? Justification
[57:35] is so instant.
[57:39] That's the power
[57:41] in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[57:46] Amen. Yes, sir.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And this is not by our faith.
[57:52] Amen. Because our faith fails
[57:56] is the faith of Jesus Christ.
[58:00] Therefore, your justification
[58:04] is an supernatural act
[58:09] like it was a supernatural act.
[58:14] For the life of the thief on the cross,
[58:18] he had robbed all the earth.
[58:22] How can he just tilt like that
[58:26] from death?
[58:29] It is instant.
[58:31] It cannot be done by anybody.
[58:34] It cannot be done
[58:37] by studying the Bible.
[58:39] You must have been in the economy of
[58:42] God.
[58:45] Amen. And then because you were there
[58:49] then God
[58:51] makes sure that brings you into the
[58:55] environment
[58:57] where the word is spoken and that's why
[59:01] you are here this morning.
[59:04] He brings you to the environment.
[59:07] He brings you to the atmosphere.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. which is good enough for the
[59:14] resurrection of the s.
[59:18] Amen. The faith of Jesus Christ
[59:22] checks out
[59:25] &gt;&gt; checks out in the lamb's book of life
[59:30] and on seeing your name
[59:33] Christ himself
[59:35] apply
[59:37] the life under the blood
[59:40] upon your soul.
[59:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when that
[59:45] life
[59:47] that's in the the word,
[59:51] you know, strikes your soul,
[59:55] what it does, it gives you a genetic
[1:00:00] inheritance.
[1:00:04] You understand these things.
[1:00:07] When we deal with blood,
[1:00:09] there is life in there.
[1:00:12] Are you together with me? So when this
[1:00:15] blood comes
[1:00:17] and connects itself
[1:00:20] to the seed on the inside here,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; then what we are talking about
[1:00:26] is a conception.
[1:00:30] Amen. And then a life
[1:00:33] begins to grow
[1:00:36] that you can no longer be known as a
[1:00:38] thief.
[1:00:41] You are now a son of God.
[1:00:44] You have been born again.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; So atonement
[1:00:54] is a supernatural effect
[1:00:59] and it justified the thief
[1:01:04] so instantly.
[1:01:06] Listen now. and imputed unto him
[1:01:12] the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:16] Hallelujah.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Because there was
[1:01:20] a genetic
[1:01:24] sentence here that the life that was
[1:01:28] controlling this man
[1:01:31] was not from the gene.
[1:01:34] It was from the human spirit.
[1:01:37] That's where the fall was and controlled
[1:01:41] him. So when this life come,
[1:01:44] it goes direct to the seed
[1:01:48] and there and then
[1:01:51] another life
[1:01:53] which is not connected to thievery
[1:01:57] to the
[1:02:00] begins to grow.
[1:02:03] Hallelujah. And once this life begins to
[1:02:06] grow,
[1:02:08] this other life
[1:02:10] that always bothered you begins to
[1:02:13] wither.
[1:02:18] That's what God does.
[1:02:20] That's the new bar.
[1:02:22] When God is forgiving you, he doesn't
[1:02:26] look back
[1:02:28] at the several hours
[1:02:31] behind the moment.
[1:02:34] He looks at the sincerity
[1:02:37] of the moment.
[1:02:41] Are you together with me? That's what
[1:02:43] God looks at.
[1:02:45] Because as long
[1:02:48] as when the lamb's book of life
[1:02:51] in the days of ignorance,
[1:02:54] whenever you did what you did,
[1:02:57] the Bible says, he we
[1:03:03] never saw you.
[1:03:08] That's the word.
[1:03:11] Thus the privilege
[1:03:13] of the sons and daughters of God
[1:03:17] also in the lamb's book of life.
[1:03:21] Immediately
[1:03:23] praise God immediately
[1:03:27] the economy
[1:03:30] of this man here.
[1:03:32] the nature his ways
[1:03:36] completely
[1:03:37] was transformed
[1:03:39] and became a candidate
[1:03:42] for the rapture.
[1:03:45] Amen. Amen. It's you who suffers with
[1:03:50] your human spirit.
[1:03:53] Because in the human spirit there is
[1:03:56] something we call memory.
[1:04:01] And you suffer with your memory.
[1:04:05] But in God's sight
[1:04:08] like you never did it.
[1:04:12] That's justification.
[1:04:14] Amen. So our prophet says
[1:04:18] human faith
[1:04:20] wasn't enough then
[1:04:24] it's not enough now.
[1:04:26] It takes the very faith
[1:04:29] of the son of God to drop into a man's
[1:04:32] heart
[1:04:34] so that he can receive the Lord of glory
[1:04:38] into the temple not made with heart.
[1:04:42] Amen. So your atonement
[1:04:46] is a supernatural act.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural act
[1:04:57] and it releases
[1:04:59] the atonement
[1:05:02] instantly.
[1:05:06] Praise the Lord. We are justified
[1:05:11] by the faith of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:14] and therefore
[1:05:16] rendered
[1:05:18] righteous.
[1:05:22] It is imputed
[1:05:25] the moment you come to the altar
[1:05:28] and you say Lord forgive me.
[1:05:32] You walk away
[1:05:34] not with your righteousness,
[1:05:37] but you walk away with the righteousness
[1:05:40] of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to
[1:05:44] you.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says
[1:05:52] in the message speak to this rock.
[1:05:56] He says righteousness
[1:05:59] is the attribute of salvation.
[1:06:04] Amen. But people can quit smoking,
[1:06:10] drinking
[1:06:11] and everything and still not be saved.
[1:06:18] He says righteousness
[1:06:21] is an attribute
[1:06:24] of salvation. So when you come to
[1:06:28] confess the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[1:06:33] personal savior, what you are receiving
[1:06:37] is the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:06:41] is an attribute.
[1:06:45] Okay.
[1:06:49] When you say believe,
[1:06:54] righteousness
[1:06:56] is imputed on the internet
[1:07:00] because it's an inseparable property to
[1:07:04] salvation.
[1:07:09] It's the same.
[1:07:11] But if a man at the cross that was saved
[1:07:16] by grace
[1:07:18] lived beyond the cross.
[1:07:25] Amen. Then you would have been
[1:07:29] sustained
[1:07:32] by the blood
[1:07:35] and that is sanctification.
[1:07:37] Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says
[1:07:42] we are saved by grace.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; But we are sustained by the blood.
[1:07:53] That's what it is. Grace saves you but
[1:07:58] the blood sustains
[1:08:01] and that is sanctification.
[1:08:04] So sanctification
[1:08:06] literally
[1:08:08] is hearing the word
[1:08:11] and believing by I mean living by its
[1:08:15] instruction
[1:08:18] that is righteousness.
[1:08:21] When the scripture says we are
[1:08:24] sanctified by the blood,
[1:08:27] hallelujah,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; what it means
[1:08:30] that it doesn't mean that there are
[1:08:33] basins of the blood
[1:08:36] where you are going to get
[1:08:39] and begin to wash yourself.
[1:08:42] What it means is that the life that was
[1:08:46] in the blood
[1:08:48] came back as the word
[1:08:52] to us.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So the word
[1:08:56] which sanctifies us
[1:08:59] today is the blood of Jesus.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's what Ephesians says.
[1:09:11] Amen. We are made clean by the washing
[1:09:13] waters of the word.
[1:09:18] Jesus said, "Now are you clean by the
[1:09:22] words I've spoken to you." So the word
[1:09:26] is the area of sanctification
[1:09:30] and we are not sanctified
[1:09:33] just for one day. the continuing process
[1:09:39] that the word keeps doing in our life.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the instruction of the word
[1:09:48] keeps separating you
[1:09:52] from the life that previously imprisoned
[1:09:56] you.
[1:09:58] Amen. for the purpose
[1:10:02] that God may bring you a holy service.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; So you sacrifice
[1:10:14] the things that bound you
[1:10:18] and that way you are being released
[1:10:24] for service.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:31] Now
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; the word
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; is our cleanser.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. When you study the word
[1:10:42] and you seen something there
[1:10:45] and you bow down to it
[1:10:48] and you say, "Lord, help me that this
[1:10:51] works in me."
[1:10:55] Then that's your sanctification.
[1:10:59] Will you be sanctified?
[1:11:02] Why? Because you in the word.
[1:11:05] The word sanctifies us.
[1:11:11] Are you together with me?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; to do the work of redemption,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; he was instructed by the word,
[1:11:25] that which was written on him
[1:11:29] by the prophets.
[1:11:32] And when he obeyed and followed the
[1:11:34] instructions of the word,
[1:11:39] That word could not allow him
[1:11:42] to go on the left or the right.
[1:11:46] It led him straight to the cross.
[1:11:50] And by obeying the word,
[1:11:53] he was sanctifying himself.
[1:11:57] Hallelujah. For the call.
[1:12:02] Praise God. Just like the truth
[1:12:06] that was written about Christ
[1:12:09] sanctified him for our sake,
[1:12:13] we also was written about us.
[1:12:17] What sanctifies
[1:12:22] sanctification is not something that
[1:12:24] theoretical.
[1:12:29] Sanctification
[1:12:31] is you obeying the instructions of the
[1:12:34] word.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; John 17
[1:12:42] 19.
[1:12:46] He says, "For their sakes
[1:12:51] I sanctify myself
[1:12:54] that they also
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; might be sanctified
[1:13:00] through the truth.
[1:13:05] So when we study the word
[1:13:10] and we walk by the word,
[1:13:13] we are possessing our vessels
[1:13:17] unto sanctification.
[1:13:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[1:13:22] Thessalonians 4:4.
[1:13:26] Amen. possessing
[1:13:29] our vessels
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; by obedience.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And when you possess
[1:13:38] your vessel
[1:13:40] in obedience,
[1:13:42] that's sanctification.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:52] Let us look at ourselves at the cross.
[1:14:00] So I said I was going to deal with the
[1:14:02] fuse today
[1:14:05] of the cross
[1:14:09] saying
[1:14:11] Lord remember
[1:14:14] we just want to walk through the journey
[1:14:18] of our redemption.
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:21] It's not something strange.
[1:14:25] is just eviding yourself
[1:14:29] so that God can work with you by you in
[1:14:35] you to bring you to what you are
[1:14:37] supposed to.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus finds you at the cross
[1:14:45] dying
[1:14:47] because of your sin
[1:14:49] just like he met the thief.
[1:14:53] Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; A real conviction
[1:14:59] where you come and say, "Lord, forgive
[1:15:04] is not just a m of a child
[1:15:08] who has been raised in a believer's
[1:15:10] family
[1:15:13] to say now that I have come to the age
[1:15:16] of responsibility,
[1:15:19] let me also go.
[1:15:23] There is a conviction
[1:15:27] that brings you into the house of God.
[1:15:31] There is a conviction
[1:15:34] that makes you cry out and say, "Lord,
[1:15:40] remember me."
[1:15:43] You see, we must come to such a
[1:15:46] conviction.
[1:15:50] Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Don't try to run away
[1:15:54] from the conviction
[1:15:57] when the Holy Spirit brings it to you
[1:16:01] because that's the way God works.
[1:16:05] Maybe you came down here
[1:16:08] because of a, you know, a connection.
[1:16:13] Maybe because of my husband
[1:16:16] or because of my dad,
[1:16:19] but you need to allow God
[1:16:23] to meet you at the cross personally.
[1:16:29] Don't run away from the conviction
[1:16:32] because God is dealing with you
[1:16:37] at the cross and on the instant.
[1:16:41] Amen. When you are there and you come to
[1:16:44] that point,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, that's when Christ
[1:16:50] takes over your judgment.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the thief
[1:16:56] doesn't die as a sinner.
[1:16:59] Jesus takes his position
[1:17:02] as a sinner that he may be free.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes
[1:17:11] There is a way we fight the conviction.
[1:17:16] A man who is not a child of God
[1:17:19] does not suffer conviction
[1:17:24] like the thief other thief on the cross.
[1:17:28] He was not suffering his conviction.
[1:17:32] That was his nature.
[1:17:35] If you suffer conviction,
[1:17:38] you are a child of God.
[1:17:43] You see the thief, the wrong thief,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; the unrepentant thief,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; he kept mocking,
[1:17:54] there is no conviction.
[1:17:57] But when you are a child of God,
[1:18:01] take your conviction seriously
[1:18:05] because sanctification
[1:18:08] is a continuous process.
[1:18:14] If you are convicted of anything,
[1:18:17] it doesn't mean you are bad.
[1:18:21] It only means you need more of the
[1:18:24] blood.
[1:18:28] You just go and say Lord wash me even
[1:18:31] here now.
[1:18:34] So you and I are living on the other
[1:18:38] side of the cross
[1:18:41] and we are fully justified.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are putting ourselves now
[1:18:49] in the position
[1:18:51] which that thief would have lived in
[1:18:55] if he had lived beyond the cross.
[1:19:02] Praise the Lord. Therefore is the cross
[1:19:07] where a Christian
[1:19:10] begins to battle
[1:19:13] with what Paul
[1:19:15] cause the works of the flesh.
[1:19:18] That man, if he had lived beyond the the
[1:19:22] cross,
[1:19:25] his human mind
[1:19:28] would still say, he has the ability to
[1:19:31] steal.
[1:19:36] But because
[1:19:39] he was dead,
[1:19:42] he didn't live into that battle.
[1:19:46] But you Christ met you on the cross
[1:19:50] and he redeemed.
[1:19:52] The redemption came to the soul.
[1:19:56] But your human spirit still has the
[1:19:59] memory
[1:20:01] of the wrong path you took
[1:20:04] from the cross. will declare a war.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So when you believe,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; you come into regions of battle
[1:20:21] and then you enter the greatest battle
[1:20:23] for fall
[1:20:26] because the enemy Satan
[1:20:29] will keep whispering to you.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; So the past
[1:20:36] At this time beyond the cross
[1:20:40] becomes the shame
[1:20:43] and there is no way you can be exercised
[1:20:48] in your past.
[1:20:50] Amen without a painful soul.
[1:20:57] So Paul calls your past
[1:21:01] the works of the flesh.
[1:21:04] And he mentions some of them.
[1:21:07] He says adultery,
[1:21:10] fornication,
[1:21:12] uncleanness,
[1:21:14] lasciviousness,
[1:21:17] idolatry,
[1:21:19] witchcraft,
[1:21:21] hatred,
[1:21:23] variance,
[1:21:27] emulations,
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:34] wrath, strife,
[1:21:38] Seditions,
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; heresies,
[1:21:43] heresies,
[1:21:46] enviness,
[1:21:52] rein,
[1:21:55] so many things.
[1:21:57] So now those
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; become your battlefront
[1:22:05] and you live
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; in the battle zone.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; But what happens
[1:22:12] is that you step into Ephesians 6.
[1:22:18] Hallelujah. so that he can dress you
[1:22:23] with his armor.
[1:22:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; So that you can have the sword of the
[1:22:30] spirit.
[1:22:32] You have the helmet of salvation.
[1:22:35] You have the belt of faith.
[1:22:38] You have the sword of the word.
[1:22:41] You are armed.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have now come from the
[1:22:50] negative.
[1:22:56] Now we have come to the positive army.
[1:23:00] That's now what we come to
[1:23:04] when the Lord allows us to live
[1:23:07] after the cross
[1:23:10] battle.
[1:23:15] Are you together with me? you come into
[1:23:18] battle time.
[1:23:22] So your heart's desire
[1:23:25] is now to step into the newness of life
[1:23:30] where you really feel like it's a
[1:23:33] responsibility on your side
[1:23:37] to live a life of appreciating what God
[1:23:40] has done.
[1:23:45] Nobody is going to push you.
[1:23:48] These are not works.
[1:23:51] It's the grace of God
[1:23:54] that comes and reminds you.
[1:23:57] Do you remember how far I brought you
[1:24:01] and it's a personal responsibility
[1:24:06] that what God did, I would have died as
[1:24:09] a thief.
[1:24:13] But now that I'm set free,
[1:24:16] God, I desire to live a life
[1:24:20] that pleases you.
[1:24:24] To live your life
[1:24:27] with a commitment,
[1:24:30] to the righteousness of God,
[1:24:33] which you receive when you are
[1:24:35] justified.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So is now beyond the cross.
[1:24:46] You now have a new identity with the
[1:24:48] father.
[1:24:51] Now you are not a thief. You are not a
[1:24:54] prostitute. You are not a witch. You
[1:24:57] have come beyond the cross.
[1:25:00] Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] Not a dying thief anymore.
[1:25:05] But today now you are sons and daughters
[1:25:08] of God.
[1:25:11] We are what the scripture calls my
[1:25:13] little children.
[1:25:16] What the Bible says, my brethren,
[1:25:20] now you are a new creation.
[1:25:23] Now the Bible calls you a saint.
[1:25:26] Now you are hes with God.
[1:25:29] Now you are the body of Christ. Now you
[1:25:32] are the church of the living God.
[1:25:34] Amen. Accept your identity in Christ.
[1:25:39] and walk in that particular identity.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; This is the challenge
[1:25:49] we have beyond the cross.
[1:25:54] Amen. Let's go to first John chapter 2
[1:25:57] here.
[1:25:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; We are God's little children.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to realize this. Especially
[1:26:09] you parents,
[1:26:11] how you adore your children.
[1:26:14] You like them. You don't want them to
[1:26:17] get into dangerous places.
[1:26:20] And if they do wrong, you don't bring
[1:26:23] them home and slaughter them.
[1:26:26] You instruct them how to walk in the
[1:26:31] state of sanctification.
[1:26:36] That's what John
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; is dealing with
[1:26:42] with the believers
[1:26:44] that now you have accepted Christ
[1:26:48] and you are righteous.
[1:26:50] But remember you have entered into the
[1:26:53] region
[1:26:54] of daily sacrifice
[1:26:58] sanctification.
[1:27:01] So he says in first John 2
[1:27:05] And verse one,
[1:27:08] my little children,
[1:27:12] these things write I unto you
[1:27:17] that you see not.
[1:27:22] Don't choose to see.
[1:27:27] But if any of you sin,
[1:27:32] we have an advocate with the father,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the righteous.
[1:27:41] And he is the propriator,
[1:27:45] is the propation of our sins
[1:27:50] and not for ours only,
[1:27:53] but also for the son. I mean for the
[1:27:56] sins of the world.
[1:28:00] I write to you that we are void
[1:28:05] the habit of willful sinning.
[1:28:11] Are you seeing where is taking us?
[1:28:15] But if it ever happens,
[1:28:18] we have got the path.
[1:28:22] Amen. of sanctification.
[1:28:26] We still have the father's son.
[1:28:30] The Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:33] on the throne.
[1:28:36] He's still the propri in the prepation
[1:28:40] of our sin. Go to him and say, "Lord,
[1:28:45] I'm not okay.
[1:28:48] I have a conviction.
[1:28:50] I've done wrong.
[1:28:53] Friends,
[1:28:57] God
[1:29:01] has kept the door open
[1:29:05] after the cross.
[1:29:08] The door is open
[1:29:10] to your forgiveness.
[1:29:16] Are you together with me? So it's your
[1:29:19] responsibility
[1:29:22] to live
[1:29:24] a life of appreciation.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And then you got him say, "Lord,
[1:29:31] give me grace.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Forgive me."
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So let's just go the journey here
[1:29:41] into the baptism. I mean the journey of
[1:29:44] the Holy Spirit. Let me call it that.
[1:29:48] The journey of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:52] commences at Calvary
[1:29:55] where that man said, "Lord, remember
[1:30:00] me."
[1:30:02] Right at that spot,
[1:30:06] that man wouldn't have felt right
[1:30:11] except by the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:17] Are you together with me? This is where
[1:30:20] the Holy Spirit begins with you.
[1:30:23] Because there is no way
[1:30:26] you can justify
[1:30:28] and sanctify yourself.
[1:30:31] It's the work
[1:30:34] of the Holy Spirit right from the spot
[1:30:38] where we begin from
[1:30:41] as a thief at the cross.
[1:30:45] Listen to what brother Brham says here.
[1:30:48] The message is so by himself
[1:30:51] of Jeffersonville.
[1:30:54] He says, "Now then
[1:30:57] there was justification,
[1:31:01] sanctification,
[1:31:03] the bapt of the Holy Ghost, not three
[1:31:08] different dispensations,
[1:31:12] not three works of grace,
[1:31:18] but one work
[1:31:21] in different manifestations.
[1:31:25] Same Holy Spirit
[1:31:28] was with Luther
[1:31:30] and justification
[1:31:32] was under Wesley
[1:31:35] with sanctification
[1:31:37] in the church now
[1:31:40] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:43] Not to Holy Spirit,
[1:31:45] the same.
[1:31:47] Holy Spirit
[1:31:49] was with Luther
[1:31:52] at justification,
[1:31:54] was with the thief
[1:31:57] at the cross because that was his
[1:32:00] justification.
[1:32:06] So if you never felt the conviction
[1:32:10] of a supernatural power,
[1:32:14] then you begin to question your
[1:32:16] experience.
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:21] If you just walk to the altar
[1:32:25] because you wanted to please your
[1:32:27] father,
[1:32:28] you begin to question. Holy Ghost must
[1:32:32] be involved.
[1:32:34] is your justification.
[1:32:39] You cannot walk yourself
[1:32:42] from the cross to Pentecost.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; After the cross,
[1:32:49] Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost.
[1:32:54] He justifies you
[1:32:57] first by his own faith
[1:33:00] and declares you right here
[1:33:03] like you never did it to begin with.
[1:33:06] And then he becomes the inside teacher
[1:33:12] of the word
[1:33:14] to start a continuing work of
[1:33:17] sanctification.
[1:33:22] You cannot be sanctified
[1:33:25] just by what you hear in church.
[1:33:30] Now the same Holy Spirit
[1:33:33] that justifies you becomes resident
[1:33:38] as an inside teacher
[1:33:44] that you begin to meditate on the word.
[1:33:48] Because if you hear and leave it here,
[1:33:52] it's not effective.
[1:33:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He wants you
[1:34:02] to be taught.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And he says they'll be taught of the
[1:34:08] Lord.
[1:34:10] The inside teacher.
[1:34:13] That's why when you come to church,
[1:34:17] you must surrender your soul
[1:34:20] that the Holy Spirit may teach it.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; When you start fighting with what you
[1:34:29] hear,
[1:34:31] you can never be sanctified.
[1:34:37] So justification
[1:34:40] is believing the law.
[1:34:43] You are justified by faith.
[1:34:46] And Romans 5:1 says
[1:34:50] for being justified by faith,
[1:34:59] then we are peace with God
[1:35:02] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:06] You must come to a point
[1:35:09] where you have to convince yourself
[1:35:13] with what you believe.
[1:35:17] It's nice to be taught by your teacher.
[1:35:24] that when you hear,
[1:35:26] you have to take the word
[1:35:29] and feed back on it
[1:35:32] and convince yourself
[1:35:35] by revelation.
[1:35:37] That's the only way you can be able to
[1:35:40] stand permanent as a Christian.
[1:35:47] Justification,
[1:35:49] as I always say, is an everlasting
[1:35:51] effect,
[1:35:54] being justified,
[1:35:57] a continuing effect.
[1:36:01] It's a work of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:04] It's a turn around
[1:36:07] from a life
[1:36:09] of deliberate sin.
[1:36:13] Amen. In justification,
[1:36:17] one's heart
[1:36:19] is turned around
[1:36:22] in repentance.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So justification
[1:36:29] is the heart's desire
[1:36:33] to pursue holiness.
[1:36:37] That's the desire.
[1:36:39] I know all of you who come here,
[1:36:42] you don't desire to be bad.
[1:36:45] And God says you don't desire to be bad.
[1:36:51] That's why he says if you sin,
[1:36:57] we have the propagation
[1:37:00] for sin. Take it to the Lord.
[1:37:03] Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; You must convince yourself.
[1:37:09] Talk to yourself.
[1:37:14] Question yourself
[1:37:17] about your commitment
[1:37:21] to the new birth.
[1:37:24] Amen.
[1:37:25] Amen. The prophet says part of the Holy
[1:37:30] Spirit
[1:37:32] is justification.
[1:37:35] That's questions and answers of 1961.
[1:37:40] He is saying part
[1:37:43] of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:46] is justification.
[1:37:49] God has to call you
[1:37:54] or
[1:37:55] you'll never be called.
[1:37:59] So the Holy Ghost
[1:38:01] has to get involved.
[1:38:05] in your justification.
[1:38:10] He got involved
[1:38:13] in the fifth
[1:38:16] to realize
[1:38:18] that this is the Lord
[1:38:20] and even to realize
[1:38:23] that he needed his intervention.
[1:38:28] So the prophet says here see there is
[1:38:31] nothing you can do in yourself.
[1:38:36] No man can come to me
[1:38:40] except my father's draw him first.
[1:38:45] Is that right? So part of justification
[1:38:51] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:54] That's a quote.
[1:38:56] But then sometimes you are put in a
[1:38:59] straight
[1:39:03] So that you may think you justify
[1:39:05] yourself
[1:39:08] and then you sanctify yourself.
[1:39:10] The prophet says no. The Holy Ghost
[1:39:14] right from justification.
[1:39:17] So in justification,
[1:39:19] the Holy Ghost turns you away
[1:39:23] from all the field
[1:39:27] and negativity
[1:39:30] and opens you up
[1:39:33] into the revealed word
[1:39:37] of your season.
[1:39:42] You see, and this now is what we call
[1:39:46] sanctification.
[1:39:50] You have been opened in a channel
[1:39:54] where you desire
[1:39:57] to live a life of holiness.
[1:40:00] Amen. So with sanctification,
[1:40:04] the word
[1:40:07] dictates your work.
[1:40:12] Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; So you begin to desire
[1:40:17] that Lord I want to do your will.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And each time you discover the will of
[1:40:24] God
[1:40:26] by studying the work
[1:40:30] and you do that will
[1:40:33] you are being sanctified.
[1:40:38] Are you together with me? You study
[1:40:41] several things
[1:40:43] about the life of a housewife.
[1:40:48] You read about holy women.
[1:40:52] Amen. You read about Esther. You read
[1:40:55] about Ruth. You read about Hannah. You
[1:40:59] read about all these women. And they
[1:41:02] dictate your life
[1:41:06] as a housewife.
[1:41:09] Sarah.
[1:41:10] is deciding about what a wife must be.
[1:41:16] And as a sister
[1:41:18] studies and obeys
[1:41:21] and practices,
[1:41:23] that is your sanctification.
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; It works for you
[1:41:32] because that's you in the word.
[1:41:36] Amen. But if I come to you,
[1:41:39] And they say women should not do this.
[1:41:43] There is a human spirit.
[1:41:45] It will tell you men are like that.
[1:41:51] You think also the pastor is not a man.
[1:41:55] But if you get in the word,
[1:41:58] whatever you see, you see yourself in
[1:42:01] it.
[1:42:05] with sanctification.
[1:42:07] The word dictates your work,
[1:42:11] cleanses you from error.
[1:42:15] Amen. and causes you to develop such a
[1:42:20] sweet conscience
[1:42:25] which is a desire
[1:42:27] and you'll even get this Bible
[1:42:30] and you'll go and talk to your sister
[1:42:34] that says
[1:42:36] I found first Peter 3
[1:42:41] teaches about
[1:42:43] and the womenh
[1:42:46] I'll have to dress appropriately.
[1:42:51] It's your discovery.
[1:42:53] I was telling my daughter today
[1:42:56] these things of here.
[1:42:59] These are not Christian fashions.
[1:43:06] They are fashions
[1:43:08] but they are not yours.
[1:43:11] You buy them
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; and you suffer with them. Again you put
[1:43:16] something inside
[1:43:19] now.
[1:43:23] God have mercy.
[1:43:25] Sanctification
[1:43:27] is the process of Christ
[1:43:30] the high priest washing his house
[1:43:35] with a purpose
[1:43:37] to occupy it in the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:40] Spirit.
[1:43:41] That's sanctification.
[1:43:44] Justification
[1:43:46] had a purpose
[1:43:49] to declare you righteous
[1:43:51] and open you up to the leadership of the
[1:43:54] world.
[1:43:56] And now sanctification
[1:43:58] which is the leadership of the word had
[1:44:01] a purpose to clean you so that you can
[1:44:05] become the habitation of the Holy
[1:44:07] Spirit.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; So let us talk about the baptism here.
[1:44:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:20] is Christ the high priest
[1:44:24] entering
[1:44:26] into the holy of holies.
[1:44:29] Like if we can talk about the tent of
[1:44:32] Moses,
[1:44:35] the tabernacle in the wilderness,
[1:44:38] it had three,
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; but there was only one man
[1:44:44] who could go through the first court.
[1:44:48] Amen. And also the second court
[1:44:52] and they entered the holy of holies
[1:44:55] who is the high priest.
[1:44:58] The high priest, was an image
[1:45:03] was a type
[1:45:05] of Christ, the high priest of our
[1:45:11] high priest.
[1:45:14] He entered
[1:45:16] into the holy of holies
[1:45:18] where the elements of life were.
[1:45:23] Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Spirit there
[1:45:30] is not you entering into the holy of
[1:45:33] holies.
[1:45:35] Why? Because you are the temple.
[1:45:41] You cannot enter your own temple.
[1:45:45] The Holy Spirit
[1:45:48] enters now into the temple.
[1:45:52] He enters past the justification.
[1:45:56] He enters past sanctification.
[1:45:59] And then enters directly
[1:46:02] into the holy of holies, which is the
[1:46:06] soul.
[1:46:08] And once he's entered there, we mean
[1:46:11] that you are being baptized with the
[1:46:13] Holy Ghost.
[1:46:16] And at that time,
[1:46:18] your seed gene
[1:46:21] which dwells in the soul
[1:46:24] is quickened
[1:46:26] because the light has come to the
[1:46:29] center.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Let there be light
[1:46:35] and after that let every seed bring
[1:46:39] forth of it.
[1:46:41] Hallelujah. So now the seeds began to
[1:46:46] come through
[1:46:48] because the light came
[1:46:50] and shine upon the sea.
[1:46:53] So also the person of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:56] when he gets it there is the light that
[1:47:01] shines upon your CD.
[1:47:06] And once it shines there, then your CG
[1:47:12] begins to grow
[1:47:15] into plant.
[1:47:19] And what happens later,
[1:47:22] it begins to bring the fruit.
[1:47:27] But that fruit is not your fruit. is the
[1:47:31] fruit of the Holy Spirit who has come in
[1:47:35] and quickened your seed Jesus.
[1:47:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; The husband
[1:47:42] has come together with the wife.
[1:47:46] Hallelujah. the heavenly bridegroom
[1:47:50] and the earthly bride
[1:47:53] which is your seed
[1:47:55] have come together to bring forth life.
[1:48:02] That's the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:07] Praise the Lord. Yes sir. So at that
[1:48:11] time as I said
[1:48:14] is quicker to life
[1:48:17] because the light of life has come.
[1:48:20] Then the revealed word
[1:48:24] which you have received in faith
[1:48:27] becomes permanently and eternally
[1:48:30] quickened in your soul.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. With everlasting
[1:48:37] freshness.
[1:48:41] Freshness.
[1:48:44] Amen. Like the man was
[1:48:49] put in the hall of holy.
[1:48:51] So when I come to preach, I'm not coming
[1:48:54] to preach to your your mind.
[1:48:58] No. When you receive with your mind,
[1:49:02] Open that the word goes to the soul
[1:49:07] and hide it there.
[1:49:09] When the anointing comes, he'll find
[1:49:12] mana
[1:49:13] that must be quickened.
[1:49:19] Praise the Lord. So you get a divine
[1:49:22] vindication
[1:49:25] at the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:28] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. and you find your
[1:49:31] position
[1:49:33] in the body. Even if you were as dry
[1:49:37] as the road of Aaron,
[1:49:41] you begin to b
[1:49:45] and the people will say, "There is
[1:49:47] something going on in the life of Moses.
[1:49:51] There is something going on in the life
[1:49:53] of David. It cannot be a dry rot
[1:49:58] anymore.
[1:50:02] life has entered.
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:07] Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Your ministry
[1:50:13] begins to bear fruit
[1:50:16] in his season,
[1:50:18] he told Moses.
[1:50:20] When Moses finished building and laying
[1:50:22] the things in there
[1:50:25] and he put the ark of the covenant
[1:50:29] and upon the ark of the covenant
[1:50:32] he put the uh uh he put the master seat
[1:50:38] and then God told him from there
[1:50:42] I'll talk to you
[1:50:45] and God
[1:50:48] when he gets you I mean When he baptizes
[1:50:51] you,
[1:50:53] it is him
[1:50:55] walking to the throne
[1:50:59] of your soul.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; That's when
[1:51:04] he is talking to you
[1:51:07] from the master seat.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? He sits on the
[1:51:15] master seat.
[1:51:20] And he says, "I am here
[1:51:23] as your eternal grace.
[1:51:26] I am here
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; as the power of your sanctification.
[1:51:32] I am here as the power of the life of
[1:51:36] the word
[1:51:38] inside here. All the elements of life in
[1:51:42] they get quickened.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? He's now at the throne.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He told Moses from there I'll speak to
[1:52:00] you. He's now able to communicate to you
[1:52:06] is like what brother Brandham say
[1:52:10] we have heard from Matthew.
[1:52:16] Are you together with me? This is what
[1:52:18] we are thief who has gone beyond the
[1:52:21] cross.
[1:52:25] He's standing before the presence
[1:52:28] of he that sits between the two cherub.
[1:52:35] Amen. Not stand
[1:52:38] but sits.
[1:52:42] He sits between the two cherub.
[1:52:46] Why? Because the sacrifice is there.
[1:52:50] Hebrews 1. It says after he did the
[1:52:53] work,
[1:52:55] he sat down.
[1:52:58] That means he has come to seal you.
[1:53:06] You are secure.
[1:53:08] me and when he comes in I told you you
[1:53:13] have no power to the latch.
[1:53:21] You can't even chase him to get out. He
[1:53:24] has entered
[1:53:25] the is the res.
[1:53:28] Let us let him rain. Hallelujah.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:32] Let us let him do what?
[1:53:38] But that doesn't mean that the devil is
[1:53:40] seated.
[1:53:41] Doesn't rest.
[1:53:44] He starts tell
[1:53:48] me I'm telling that they telling what
[1:53:52] they are saying fellowship
[1:53:55] the table of the lord don't go don't go
[1:54:02] he still fights.
[1:54:06] How many years will you pray?
[1:54:09] For us all the years we have been in
[1:54:10] that church, we have learned enough.
[1:54:17] The devil is a liar.
[1:54:21] He stands before the Lord
[1:54:24] to lie to people. He stands before the
[1:54:27] Lord
[1:54:30] to struggle for the life of Job.
[1:54:36] He says, "You give him to me.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; You give him to me."
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; That's the devil.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Why should we obey him?
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Tell your brother.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; No longer obeying the devil.
[1:54:55] You just choose to fight.
[1:55:00] This is battle time.
[1:55:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And as you stand before him,
[1:55:08] you are standing before a finished work.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He has come.
[1:55:16] He has taken his throne.
[1:55:19] You stand before him. You are standing
[1:55:21] before a finished work
[1:55:24] because the master seat
[1:55:27] has been already sprinkled
[1:55:30] and the life that
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:35] That's what we are.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Don't take the devil's lie.
[1:55:42] So, let's get into the last junction
[1:55:45] here.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; At this point,
[1:55:50] it changes
[1:55:52] when he has come. It changes
[1:55:56] from Lord remember me
[1:55:59] to remembering the Lord.
[1:56:04] It's now communion time.
[1:56:10] He's there with you. You are standing in
[1:56:14] his presence.
[1:56:16] It's now communion time.
[1:56:21] How many of you love communion?
[1:56:25] Amen. Yeah. Just have communion with
[1:56:27] him.
[1:56:29] The prophet says in message Christ of
[1:56:32] Phoenix.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And we pray father that you bring every
[1:56:37] person now
[1:56:40] that believes the word into this deep
[1:56:43] fellowship within
[1:56:46] that they might have faith
[1:56:49] to carry them through the love of God.
[1:56:53] wrapped them up.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah. Wrapped into the love of
[1:56:58] God. Amen.
[1:57:01] For by one time,
[1:57:04] one sacrifice
[1:57:07] he has perfected forever.
[1:57:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It is the
[1:57:13] finished work. So what he's trying to
[1:57:16] say, why do you stay outside?
[1:57:20] Don't stay out of the reach.
[1:57:22] Come at the center. Amen. Because it's
[1:57:26] fellowship time.
[1:57:28] Hallelujah. It's now time you remember
[1:57:32] the Lord.
[1:57:36] Amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Is remember me
[1:57:41] that I remember you.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. that they might have faith
[1:57:51] to carry through and the love of God to
[1:57:55] wrap them up. For by this I mean for by
[1:58:00] one time
[1:58:02] one sacrifice
[1:58:04] he has perfected
[1:58:06] forever.
[1:58:08] Amen. Not coming year after year or
[1:58:12] meeting after meeting,
[1:58:14] revival after revival,
[1:58:17] but one time
[1:58:19] perfected.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; The worshiper
[1:58:24] has no more conscious
[1:58:28] or desire for sin.
[1:58:31] He has passed from death life
[1:58:35] then
[1:58:37] into fellowship with the Lord.
[1:58:41] After the cross,
[1:58:44] the thief has lived past the cross
[1:58:50] through justification,
[1:58:52] sanctification,
[1:58:54] go of the Holy Ghost to fellowship.
[1:59:00] Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; So the master has come
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; and is now the lord of your heart
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; and he controls the door
[1:59:15] is now an everlasting time of
[1:59:19] fellowship.
[1:59:24] A little bit of singing,
[1:59:27] a little bit of meditation,
[1:59:31] a little bit on talking about his
[1:59:33] goodness.
[1:59:35] That's now where we are. It's a
[1:59:38] fellowship time.
[1:59:40] It's communion.
[1:59:43] He says in message fellowship,
[1:59:46] I love this. But one day, 1900 years
[1:59:50] ago,
[1:59:52] God made a complete fellowship to
[1:59:54] restore
[1:59:57] not into a tabernacle as he said,
[2:00:02] made with heart,
[2:00:04] but on this day,
[2:00:07] Jesus once for all
[2:00:11] and eternal fellowship for us,
[2:00:14] not every year to make a commemoration
[2:00:21] I have sinned. I have done this. I went
[2:00:25] and done this. Oh, of another lamp,
[2:00:28] another thing. Jesus once for all
[2:00:33] one time. He has perfected forever.
[2:00:37] Those that come into fellowship
[2:00:41] with an eternal blessing,
[2:00:45] eternal fellowship.
[2:00:48] with an eternal presence of God,
[2:00:51] with the power of the Holy Ghost,
[2:00:54] not in simple out
[2:00:58] or in some word
[2:01:01] or in some theology,
[2:01:03] the Holy Ghost in you.
[2:01:08] That is fellowship with God.
[2:01:10] Amen. The power of God that raised
[2:01:14] Christ from the grave
[2:01:17] alive in you and you are a new creature.
[2:01:22] You are a son
[2:01:24] and a daughter of God, a brother. That
[2:01:27] is it.
[2:01:31] He came and he says a little bit of
[2:01:34] fellowship
[2:01:37] and you opened up your heart.
[2:01:41] He talks. You must talk back
[2:01:45] just tell him that father these days
[2:01:50] I've got pressure on this pressure on
[2:01:53] this wickedness on this failure on that
[2:01:58] talk. It's fellowship time.
[2:02:04] You are not in a robber camp.
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:11] He has brought you to fellowship with
[2:02:13] him.
[2:02:16] Talk to him about the things that you
[2:02:20] feel are not right.
[2:02:25] You talk to him. He's a friend.
[2:02:30] Amen. Can you imagine
[2:02:33] that the head of state,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; he controls
[2:02:42] uh you know a budget of trillions of
[2:02:45] shieldings
[2:02:49] and he gives brown envelopes wherever he
[2:02:52] goes.
[2:02:56] This time
[2:02:58] knock on the door.
[2:03:01] When you open
[2:03:03] the kid and says,
[2:03:10] you say, "Are you crazy or what?"
[2:03:19] You run to the door and it's
[2:03:24] he says,
[2:03:26] I've come to visit
[2:03:28] just to talk with you to understand the
[2:03:31] challenges of my people.
[2:03:35] What's your problems?
[2:03:40] You get dumbfounded.
[2:03:44] You begin from the children
[2:03:47] school. We want good schools. Look at
[2:03:51] the house where you live. You vomit
[2:03:53] everything.
[2:03:58] because he has the ability.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Are you together with that's how we
[2:04:04] should act towards the Christ on thy
[2:04:07] side?
[2:04:09] [Applause]
[2:04:12] Why are you keeping quiet?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; He knows what you go through, but he
[2:04:17] only wants to know whether you care.
[2:04:24] You see, and then you begin pouring out.
[2:04:28] That's why I like children.
[2:04:31] My kids, my grandchildren,
[2:04:34] you know, she says, "Oh, you were in a
[2:04:37] plane the other day.
[2:04:39] Will you buy a plane and bring here? We
[2:04:41] also go into a plane.
[2:04:44] They don't care whether you afford
[2:04:47] or you don't afford.
[2:04:50] should be children of our God
[2:04:55] and going to fellowship with him.
[2:04:59] Amen. He says here in message
[2:05:03] fundamental foundation for faith.
[2:05:07] Now when a man fell
[2:05:09] he lost this
[2:05:12] he lost the fellowship with God.
[2:05:16] Now God has restored it.
[2:05:20] You are no longer thief at the cross.
[2:05:23] You are a son of God.
[2:05:26] You are here with the father.
[2:05:28] You were everything.
[2:05:30] [Applause]
[2:05:31] And now what he lost in the fall, Christ
[2:05:36] come to redeem.
[2:05:38] Did you ever stop to think
[2:05:41] what Christ redeemed us for?
[2:05:44] He gave us everlasting life.
[2:05:47] He brought us back to the eternal
[2:05:50] fellowship
[2:05:52] and relationship to God
[2:05:55] to his sons and daughters again
[2:05:58] back all that Adam lost.
[2:06:03] This is where we are.
[2:06:05] Amen. It's a communion time now.
[2:06:10] Lord, remember me
[2:06:13] that I always remember.
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:16] Amen.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; And he has done his part.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; He has remembered you. He has died on
[2:06:24] your behalf.
[2:06:26] He has nothing against you anymore
[2:06:29] to give you appreciation
[2:06:32] to have fellowship with you.
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:37] Amen. Amen.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Let us deal a little bit with
[2:06:40] remembering the Lord here.
[2:06:43] The bas of the Holy Ghost, the
[2:06:46] individual
[2:06:48] has found the door
[2:06:51] to eternal fellowship.
[2:06:53] He has been restored
[2:06:55] to his position
[2:06:58] in the body by a new birth. So it's a
[2:07:02] body identity now.
[2:07:06] Amen. Because the Holy Ghost
[2:07:10] does not anoint
[2:07:13] A selfserving gift.
[2:07:18] The gift is for the body.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? You cannot be
[2:07:25] made a prophet
[2:07:27] to prophesy it yourself.
[2:07:30] You cannot be given the gift pastor
[2:07:34] to pastor yourself.
[2:07:36] Whatever gift you have, you have to say
[2:07:39] like the prophet said
[2:07:42] is not mine.
[2:07:45] So beyond the cross,
[2:07:48] God has anointed several men
[2:07:52] here in the body.
[2:07:55] You and I are a part of a body. So he
[2:07:59] cannot give a gift
[2:08:01] and anoint it when it's not going to
[2:08:04] serve the body.
[2:08:06] Therefore, as individuals,
[2:08:09] we must be inducted into body fellowship
[2:08:14] for our gifts to be relevant
[2:08:19] because when he comes and he takes
[2:08:22] residence,
[2:08:23] he has given you a portion.
[2:08:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. of the Holy
[2:08:28] Spirit and the portion of pillar of fire
[2:08:33] that's in you by the basel of the Holy
[2:08:36] Ghost got different attributes
[2:08:40] than the pillar of fire in me.
[2:08:46] So now everybody when we come together
[2:08:50] we are bringing the uniqueness of God
[2:08:55] into greater measure.
[2:08:58] It's fellowship time now.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are being justified
[2:09:08] and we made a public testimony
[2:09:12] by a water baptism.
[2:09:14] We are constantly being sanctified
[2:09:20] by the teaching of the word
[2:09:23] by the five ministry
[2:09:26] and by the constant interaction with the
[2:09:29] inside teacher.
[2:09:33] We therefore
[2:09:35] now step into the life after Pentecost.
[2:09:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you together
[2:09:44] with me? The thief at the cross
[2:09:48] redeemed.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Now what happens now is that God
[2:09:57] must take that thief
[2:10:00] beyond Pentecost
[2:10:07] to see where we are.
[2:10:10] He brings us
[2:10:12] into a state
[2:10:14] where we must learn to appreciate our
[2:10:18] redemption.
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I feel good.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I'll take you to the book of Luke,
[2:10:33] chapter 22,
[2:10:35] verse 19.
[2:10:41] Now Jesus
[2:10:44] is going to the cross
[2:10:47] and is preparing a life
[2:10:51] of the people that they are going to
[2:10:54] live after the cross.
[2:10:59] And if you are a thief
[2:11:01] at the cross and Jesus died for you to
[2:11:06] bring you past the cross,
[2:11:10] he's giving you instructions here
[2:11:14] in Luke 22:9
[2:11:17] and he took bread
[2:11:20] and gave thanks
[2:11:24] and break it and gave unto them saying,
[2:11:29] This is my body
[2:11:32] which is given for you.
[2:11:34] This do in remembrance of me.
[2:11:39] Likewise also the cup after supper
[2:11:45] saying this cup is the new testament
[2:11:50] in my blood which is shed for you.
[2:11:55] So he prepared them
[2:11:58] for the life
[2:12:01] beyond the cross.
[2:12:04] When the Holy Spirit came down
[2:12:08] to upon the 120 in their room
[2:12:13] and the 3,000 that were outside,
[2:12:17] they entered
[2:12:19] into a season
[2:12:21] of remembering the Lord.
[2:12:25] And this is where we live.
[2:12:29] They continued in breaking bread.
[2:12:33] They kept in memory
[2:12:36] elements of the New Testament
[2:12:39] the bread and the wine.
[2:12:44] Because Jesus
[2:12:47] had instructed them
[2:12:49] about the lie beyond the cross.
[2:12:54] He wanted them to come together as a
[2:12:56] body
[2:12:58] and continue remembering the Lord
[2:13:01] by the two elements,
[2:13:03] the bread and the wine.
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:17] Praise the Lord. Bread and wine,
[2:13:21] the spirit and the word
[2:13:24] to sustain
[2:13:27] the life of the church.
[2:13:30] So these are symbols of communion.
[2:13:36] The symbols that prove
[2:13:38] we are in the continuing fellowship with
[2:13:42] Christ.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; He brought out the communion
[2:13:51] after the battle.
[2:13:54] You remember Genesis 14. Abraham after
[2:13:59] he had won the battle
[2:14:01] then the master
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:06] came with the symbols after the battle
[2:14:10] was done.
[2:14:15] He had won
[2:14:17] the works of the flesh.
[2:14:20] He had won the kings that were trying to
[2:14:23] control the land.
[2:14:29] And when you overcome
[2:14:31] the flesh, the desires of the flesh,
[2:14:35] After you overcome
[2:14:37] all the desires of the life of the
[2:14:39] things of the world,
[2:14:42] you come to a moment
[2:14:44] when you must have
[2:14:47] communion
[2:14:49] with the Lord.
[2:14:52] You said, "Remember me."
[2:14:55] He remembered you.
[2:14:58] But now
[2:15:00] it's remembering the Lord.
[2:15:03] Now that he didn't ignore you,
[2:15:07] you don't ignore him.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:17] You cannot be
[2:15:19] in a divine communion with Christ.
[2:15:24] Amen. And then you don't care about him.
[2:15:29] Praise the Lord. Listen.
[2:15:33] When did Abraham
[2:15:35] have his communion?
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:39] Do you remember?
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:15:46] after he won the kings,
[2:15:50] he came to the communion.
[2:15:54] Have you won the kings
[2:15:57] that controlled your flesh?
[2:16:00] That's why you're here.
[2:16:02] because you won the kings.
[2:16:05] The works of the flesh
[2:16:07] and therefore you are here. You are not
[2:16:10] perfect yet,
[2:16:12] God is still working on you.
[2:16:16] Abraham
[2:16:17] was not Abraham yet.
[2:16:21] But because he had won the kings,
[2:16:25] God came and served him with communion.
[2:16:29] I know there is a lot
[2:16:33] that you desire the Lord to do in your
[2:16:35] life.
[2:16:37] But with what you have received so far,
[2:16:41] accept to come into communion.
[2:16:45] When Melisedc comes
[2:16:51] Thank you, brother. There was more for
[2:16:54] Abraham.
[2:16:56] Even the son had not come yet.
[2:17:00] But they kissed them, recognize
[2:17:03] that victory so far.
[2:17:06] And then he came down
[2:17:09] and he said, "Now we are going to have
[2:17:11] communion."
[2:17:16] And why do you stay away when
[2:17:21] he comes to your local church and he
[2:17:24] says this community?
[2:17:28] He was not Abraham yet.
[2:17:33] There were still certain things. But God
[2:17:37] recognize the victory he had so far.
[2:17:42] And he says, "With this, I'll serve you
[2:17:45] communion."
[2:17:49] You see, I don't know why you stay away
[2:17:54] when there's communion in it.
[2:17:58] I said we are going to walk the journey
[2:18:03] of our Christian life
[2:18:05] and now this is the far we have come
[2:18:08] a communion time
[2:18:12] to commune with him.
[2:18:15] There was more that the Lord had to deal
[2:18:19] with Abraham's life.
[2:18:24] So Abraham
[2:18:26] was not receiving this communion
[2:18:31] because he had received a complete
[2:18:33] perfection.
[2:18:39] That's why when we are going to have
[2:18:42] communion,
[2:18:44] the prophet would say put everything
[2:18:46] right in your life.
[2:18:51] So if you're waiting for perfect,
[2:18:56] when will you ever come to communion?
[2:19:00] When will you ever remember the Lord?
[2:19:06] After he had battled the kings of the
[2:19:08] land.
[2:19:10] and defeated them. He proceeded
[2:19:14] into the valley of Shave.
[2:19:17] [Applause]
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not up on Mount Zion.
[2:19:25] It was down in the valley
[2:19:28] and synonymous with battles
[2:19:32] trials. And that's where
[2:19:36] met him and suffered
[2:19:41] He wants to meet you.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; He's doing this to extend grace.
[2:19:52] The battles were fought and overcome in
[2:19:54] the valley.
[2:19:57] Always God is aware. He knows your
[2:20:01] besetting sin.
[2:20:04] He knows your depressions.
[2:20:06] He knows the hate that you fight.
[2:20:10] He knows the fear of the unknown that
[2:20:12] you suffer.
[2:20:15] Amen. But then in that condition, he
[2:20:18] says in that valley
[2:20:20] coming to you and now I won't tell you
[2:20:25] that you must eat worthlessly.
[2:20:29] Therefore, lift up your hands and wash
[2:20:32] your sin away
[2:20:35] and say, "Lord, forgive me. I'm coming
[2:20:38] to meet you at the holy time of
[2:20:41] communion
[2:20:42] with the grace of God."
[2:20:44] [Applause]
[2:20:48] You see, this is the way we are supposed
[2:20:50] to live our life.
[2:20:53] Amen. Fight the kings
[2:20:56] and overcome them.
[2:20:58] and come to the Lord's table. But many
[2:21:01] of us are in these valleys.
[2:21:05] But listen,
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; is not far.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to serve you
[2:21:15] with communion.
[2:21:17] And I want to see that at the end of the
[2:21:20] month
[2:21:22] we shall have realized
[2:21:24] the God who forgives our sin
[2:21:31] by looking at everybody
[2:21:34] come down to the communion.
[2:21:40] He's able to forgive.
[2:21:44] The Lord's table is the opportunity
[2:21:48] to remember the finished work of
[2:21:50] Calvary.
[2:21:53] The opportunity
[2:21:55] to wash our feet. The opportunity to
[2:21:59] identify with the grace of God
[2:22:02] in sanctification.
[2:22:04] It's our opportunity
[2:22:07] to wash clean.
[2:22:10] Amen.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; brother Brham says
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; in the message the contest I'm
[2:22:17] finishing.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Did you not s Paul place it here?
[2:22:25] If any eat unworthily,
[2:22:30] you see by staying away from the Lord's
[2:22:33] supper,
[2:22:36] you are trying to say that the blood
[2:22:40] does not have enough power to wash my
[2:22:43] sin.
[2:22:47] That's all that you are saying. You must
[2:22:50] have the confidence
[2:22:52] of Cal.
[2:22:54] When you said around, remember me,
[2:22:58] he remembered you.
[2:23:01] And today remember the Lord.
[2:23:07] Do this
[2:23:09] in remembrance of me.
[2:23:14] Praise the Lord. Did you not sell
[2:23:16] blessed it?
[2:23:19] eat unworthily,
[2:23:21] he eats and drinks
[2:23:24] damnation to himself,
[2:23:27] not discerning the Lord's body,
[2:23:30] which means the same thing,
[2:23:34] that death,
[2:23:36] spiritual death, rest upon the person
[2:23:40] that would partake of the Lord's supper
[2:23:43] worthy,
[2:23:46] that would be out drinking, and carrying
[2:23:49] on and living in the world
[2:23:55] and come to the Lord's table.
[2:23:58] We shouldn't do that.
[2:24:01] Now let us cleanse our hearts
[2:24:04] and cleanse our hands
[2:24:06] and our minds from the evil thinking
[2:24:10] that we might come to the Lord's table
[2:24:13] reently
[2:24:15] and holy
[2:24:17] as we walk that we are connecting
[2:24:21] ourselves
[2:24:23] with the sacrifice
[2:24:26] Christ Jesus
[2:24:28] who is our salvation.
[2:24:32] So you come to the table
[2:24:36] to remember
[2:24:38] the finished work of God.
[2:24:43] You come to the Lord's table
[2:24:46] because he came in
[2:24:49] by the bapt of the Holy Spirit.
[2:24:52] You come to the Lord's table because you
[2:24:55] are having an opportunity
[2:24:58] to put certain things right.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; So when you avoid the symbols
[2:25:07] because the bread and the wine
[2:25:10] are symbols.
[2:25:12] How can you tell me that you have got
[2:25:15] the reality
[2:25:17] of the word and the spirit?
[2:25:22] If you avoid the symbols,
[2:25:25] it is a sign you are avoiding
[2:25:29] the word and the spirit.
[2:25:33] God give us mercy.
[2:25:37] Nobody misses
[2:25:39] to the Lord's table
[2:25:43] because he's busy.
[2:25:45] They miss
[2:25:47] because they are not sure
[2:25:50] of the atonement.
[2:25:55] That's true.
[2:25:57] Next time
[2:25:59] if the Lord allows
[2:26:01] we shall deal with the atonement.
[2:26:06] I want to tell you friend
[2:26:09] that there is nothing against you
[2:26:15] but you are against yourself.
[2:26:22] Communion
[2:26:24] on the inside. Communion the symbols.
[2:26:29] Communion the word and the spirit. God
[2:26:32] bless you.
[2:26:33] [Applause]
[2:26:36] Do you love him?
[2:26:38] [Applause]
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me
[2:26:45] that I may remember him.
[2:26:49] Why should he remember me
[2:26:52] and I don't remember him?
[2:26:57] Remembering the Lord?
[2:27:00] God bless you.
[2:27:03] [Applause]
[2:27:19] Do you appreciate our pastor's clap for
[2:27:20] him again?
[2:27:22] [Applause]
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me. Praise the name of
[2:27:29] our Lord.
[2:27:31] I believe we have all been lifted up.
