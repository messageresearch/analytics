close Jordan Alone amen you may be seated you're welcome to the house of the Lord this morning amen so um it's a cold Sunday morning amen amen yeah but we appreciate I meant to give this ministry an opportunity the only reason why I'm a preacher is because of your people brother Branham said that the gift is not his it was for the people amen amen so we are here today we trust the Lord will be gracious to us we had a long drive yesterday I don't want that Echo praise the Lord so all the way from Nairobi amen from five in the morning and we got home at 5 30. the Lord was so gracious to us we bring greetings from the Saints there amen praise God now you see we are in this series where we are dealing with the bridge we are dealing with the revelation of Jesus Christ and you know Revelation is not uniformity of understanding amen amen but rather uniformity of Mind amen which mind is the mind of Christ himself so this mind is allotted to the body the mind of Christ is given to the entire body let this mind be new which was also in Christ Jesus Christ not an individual if you are not part of the body then you are not part of the mind of Christ every body is a steward to this uh is a steward to a measure of revelation of Christ amen amen but when we come together in respect of our measures then we have got a greater revelation of the mind of Christ you understand what I mean so the revelation of Christ which God gave unto Joy to show his servants but then when you look at when he begins to dispense amen what Ephesus God as a revelation of Christ was just a part of the general revelation foreign churches every Church bringing its posture and then we add it together to Advocate our life we've got the fullness of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ so these different portions of Revelation we're not uniformity of understanding but yet every person was the revelation of the mind of Christ so as we get into the teaching of the word this morning you may not understand everything but yet every one of us has got a portion which the Lord has allotted for him today amen I mean every one of you will take something home amen Amina we thank God for that that's the way God works but we want to sing with faith we want to sing the foreign [Music] God bless you Goods attributes one manifested to his bride in this last stage [Music] by the last prophet's message and We Know Who We Are and what we're raised up for praise the Lord for the original light original the original sea the original word is what I believe the son of man is revealed the seven series [Music] or it's no alarm [Music] s [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Authority and Power in Saints will wear can't join us for translations will soon foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] original [Music] oh there's no one is what I believe the son of man is revealed is [Music] what I believe [Music] the sentences [Music] for the general Italian is this system Ivan foreign [Music] behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and grateful day of the Lord and you shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smile the Earth with the curse may the Lord bless the reading of the world so you know we are going in the series on the bridge and you know I've called those series Christ in the bridge but then I've got messages in there so today we are dealing with the ministry in the end times four and six is the ministry of Christ in the end of time and this ministry course that elect out of Babylon to bring them into the body of the church to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now when we talk about the coming out coming out to Babylon we know that when the first fall came we didn't amen Amina you see man lost his uh God started working bringing man into restoration and always man has had a desire to be connected back to his father amen but then we remember amen Amina Nimrod built a tower he was determined to see God bypassing the word which is not possible so now God confused the languages it is out of there that we get the word Babylon which means confused so then God calls Abraham to be father of faith he was given an unconditional Covenant but before he could work with God God called him out of Babylon first to allow that God was going to show him and then Abraham accepted and he lived by faith and we know that out of there come Isaac the child of the promise and then Jacob comes and out of Jacob comes the 12 patrons and now out of those 12 patrons comes the nation of Israel amen whom God had called and considered them his own eyes and now we see that they come to a point and they rejected Joseph and yet Joseph was the one who had the uh Ministry for that disease [Music] [Music] and the entire family and then finally Joseph dies but then you see they continue for 400 years amen but after that time you know they came a time when a pharaoh for love wouldn't have respect for Joseph and when this man grows up Israel became slaves in the land of captivity but then you know us had been promised amen they were delivered according to the promise that God made for Abraham they were delivered out of there by a mighty hand of God under the ministry of Moses are you together with me so now they come up into the land of promise which continued going forward but after some time God warned them against you know the things that were going wrong foreign [Music] and they were there for 70 years oh my God praise the Lord So Daniel in coming out of Babylon he was not only looking for going back to Jerusalem to rest toward the natural thing I want you to recognize that you know he was thinking about the Final Redemption of his people Israel when he came out of baby are you together with me so he had looked at the Captivity [Music] the inventions of the media nice and the amalekites and the Philistines in the days of the judges and then here again the 70 years in Babylon and then he felt enough was enough I do not know whether you have come to a point where you have ever said enough is enough there Comes A Time In Our Lives [Music] of the spiritual lapses in our lives and then we cry enough is enough you are going up and then again you start coming down you you fight your way up amen and you're at the top of the mouth you are rejoicing and praising us those kind of things you come to a point where you say foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he needed the release from this kind of condition and he said oh Wretched Man yeah who shall deliver me from the body of this death amen Daniel didn't like it I'm going to Jerusalem yes but that's where we fell from yeah when will my people be taken out of this nation that's the desire of everyone amen Humanity grows Amen to be a doctor to wheat the change of their body was in the same understanding but please exit from Babylon to construct the temple was not enough are you together with me they were going down [Music] he remembered we have been in Egypt before we've been tormented by the Gentile Kingdom we were bitten out of Jerusalem for us to go back to Jerusalem and reconstructed the temples I want to say something here that coming to church is good but that's not enough we need to grow for the Redemption to with our bodies because as long as we're in these bodies Our human spirit will constantly battle the pools of evil amen amen that's what you go through every morning everything you are in battle amen you know you are born again you know you are a child of God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the one [Music] so there is a constant Feud you are baptized but then there is the battle the last of the flesh the last of the eyes the pride of life you are tormented in those battles [Music] thank you Father we are going out of capitalism [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you are having [Music] [Music] I know that we all reach for the blood you try to touch the blind and out crying for eign [Music] amen I mean so the seed on the inside begins to grow for the Redemption to which the change of your body the desire for the change of your body that was the groaning that Daniel was in no of course when the Redemption you know from Babylon came we are going to Babylon I mean we are going to Jerusalem we are being delivered from Babylon but Lord I am the same way we need more than that are you together you have broken a lot of bondages [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he was looking at the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven also amen amen so we did not come out of Babylon listen friends teaching churches we came out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] was not the destination Amen Let us look at Malachi foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is going [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what you come down to United [Music] [Music] [Music] of the days [Music] we have to find it over here again huh [Music] [Music] [Music] yes we'll always catch life are you together so Jesus says As it was in the days of Love they did it they drank they planted they build it it was a prosperous uh Sodom yeah and he says this show them here will come back again a lot of prosperity and a lot of pleasure after party and then he says but the same day that Lord went out of sun he trained fire and premises are you together no just after lot is going down then comes the Judgment amen so then he says [Music] when the son of man is revealed Hallelujah we have seen two things is coming again a sovereign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you understand what Prosperity is you go out there in countries like the states [Music] [Music] brother James amen from fortified 78 years today later the development is unbelievable too much development we find that they have dropped back in the Sodom conditions for you to rejoice and be happy you must not say anything about sodium somebody when I was going to distress side brother Stephen don't involve yourself in those things don't say anything about them so I won't tell you that the days of Sodom are here and I think all of you believe it if the days of Sodom are here the revealing of the son of man is also here amen amen there is no question we are back in the days of Saturday and therefore this should be the days of the son of Manchester United so I want to speak here a little bit of that three fourth sonship Ministry amen amen God comes down in three sons names [Music] then he turned out to the work of the religion and at the end is going to be king of the Kingdom so first became a son of man yeah [Music] they think son of man means one is born of flesh but when God was talking to Ezekiel as a prophet he was referring to him as son of man foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] rather there will be grace foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because they knewana his time was coming to declare himself Son of God when it comes down into your life to bring a condemnation of sins [Music] is Christ in his priesthood office [Music] he died once and the sacrifice is enough but as you walk along the pilgrimage there is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] will be the ministry foreign [Music] [Music] before the day of the Lord foreign [Music] are you together with me what is it the revealed words becomes your fortification once you have that work by Revelation it becomes a fortification amen you don't have to know everything did you hear what I say but you must have a portion that is yours Peter didn't have to know everything but he had the kids [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] is Christ himself standing in the bridge amen Amina why do we need a prophet in the bridge right now ask yourself we need a prophet in the bridge because when we are called out of organization foreign [Music] [Music] all these other groups they are proud of their prophets who are not even prophets because the word comes unto the prophets but the understanding of the godhead can't come to them together foreign because [Music] there is a we must get out of here but you know between time I identity I got your website and Eternity God allow this space of time but why is she amen Amina in the bridge you need to know that we are still in the timeline of Lord this year amen Amina but the bride is separated by a supernatural presence the Lord himself descends in the ministry that's what separates us to bring us here in the bridge that's why you are no longer a denominational believer Hallelujah you are talking about the presence of the Lord himself today is the time like Israel was before The Exodus [Music] praise the Lord there were certain distinctive things that God was doing for the children of Israel for them to realize amen amen because they were living in Gosling there was light in the that time it was light she said and during the night there was light Trump said [Music] there was Darkness [Music] there was Darkness God was doing that to awaken these people that there is a supernatural Powers into the Exodus he gave them a redeeming pillow fight that was going to go with them are you together he was speaking to them are you together with him he was speaking to them by a prophet now the prophet cannot be told them to apply that okay the way they applied is by believing what the prophet told him and they do it and that's the way we are going to apply the tokens not coming to church but to hear what the problem and then we perform it when we perform we are applying the tokens [Music] and when they slept the land [Music] Amen on the you know [Music] [Music] [Music] what happened [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a preparation foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] John 17 14. now I have given them Thy word and the world has hated them and see even never that's very nice I have given them thy well and the world has hated them I want why has the world hated them foreign you see you need to bring this message and loved the world by the world at the same time it's not possible this message here the world will hurt yes because your lifestyle condemns them even if you don't speak anything but the good dresses you think for us you dress like this will not go to Heaven Los Angeles why don't you paint your face [Music] even if you don't answer you think when you paint your face you are very holy always the world has hated them because they are not of the world hallelujah praise God he was giving them the word in negotiation because they were not of that country they were going into next and they needed the words separate them from Egypt are you together with me that's why we are receiving this message amen we are not of this world I am not of the world Jesus says the world will resist to you because you don't act like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and now you see what Jesus says in verse 15. I pray not that thou should take them out of the world [Music] but that thou should Escape them from the evil that's the bridge now Unity it's a condition that God blesses you here he's saying I'm not taking them away now according to Liberty but I'm putting them in a condition amen Amina why are you keep them away from everything around them you keep them away from the Disco Hallelujah you keep them away from false release you keep them away from the things that the world endures [Music] [Music] I am not of the world Sanctified them through thy truth is [Music] not to put you in the wilderness not separate you from your family but he gives you a super conditions [Music] which loves the word of God [Music] keeps washing you so the bridge is the condition where God brings the speaker tonight [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um are you together with the Milan is it yeah so the bridge is a spiritual Sofia it's a spiritual Zone Zone that's the Holy Spirit foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] there was a dog origin which Jesus was turning on behold they stand and look [Music] if when a man hear my wife and come to me I will feed with him are you together he was knocking on the door [Music] I want to come in I want it with you and you with me but remember he is my wife according to you and now the only people will ever to come back because we had the wife we come through this door and now we come down here to the bridge a supernatural condition to eat with the master [Music] God has made for you [Music] [Music] [Music] because we shall be going home soon are you together with me you don't come in here to remain the way you wear out there is a cleansing of Grace which is in here it washes us with high subjects how do you wash your passage that we are loved over here hallelujah he's washing our feet praise God Amen because he loved them he loves us so much that is washing Us by his words before our enemies God is going to feed you with the revelation of this message foreign [Music] [Music] so we come here in the bridge before the presence and the presence washes Us by the word washing Waters of the world so you come here to be washed by the way amen amen if the word speaks about your fashion except to be watched if the word speaks about your relationships are you together praise God and this class is your perfect faith that comes by the washing Waters of the world each time the word speaks to you and you say amen that's your worship amen I mean at that day shall it be said again now are you clean but which I have spoken unto you baby have you seen this is the washing time it's only all the good of the ages that powers into the bridge [Music] could not come through that door that is foreign [Music] foreign everything from Genesis that's why you know in Genesis we have that tree of life in Revelation you find that tree of life in Genesis we have got the serpent there um you know everything how to start in Genesis amen I mean so I want you now to take that peace and look at the Ephesian churches as the seed chapter is Church that begins the Life of Christ to the end here that's why Jovan we should not open for any negative seats you open up negative seats yes about the church it will stick you will cease to see anything good foreign [Music] [Music] the message caused them for bags foreign [Music] [Music] foreign ation [Music] yes it started out as a locusts the leaves of fellowships you don't like to Fellowship anymore [Music] then it becomes another insected the fruit of the spirit now you can hate it foreign because you are loud a negative seed yes again be to come and live in your life in Genesis those seeds were not there yes they were just developing into something else and something else you need to deal with that attitude that's developing in your life because it wants to bring a paralysis to your spiritual life [Music] amen you need an individual Bridge with Christ the crystal like a Jacob and wrestle with that engine take it away from me amen I don't want it don't settlement cannot understand it will destroy to [Music] it goes all the way to the year okay listen now the second seal comes forth and goes right on you to the end yeah and goes right on you to the end every one of them winds up right out here in the end that's why I tell you this year is the age of harvest [Music] you know amen amen and at the end times these books that's been rolled up every time which are the books of sales amen with the mysteries in them it's broken then out comes the Mysteries to see what it is but actually they started forth as the first church because of the first church received the message like this they keep coming side by side and now when it comes Lord this is so they come in by that door into the bridge the rest of the crop by everything baby cannot come here beyond that door okay to the bridge amen Amina now listen to this it is like the Book of Genesis what started in the Genesis through the entire world and finally close us out in Revelation does this church beginning in Acts is God's blueprint for all ages until she closes out in the auditions [Music] watch it yeah for what's going on in here that little tree that was planted is going to grow it's going to go through the edges that's the principle he says it's actually one Church which passes through yes all the way to the Rocks amen Amina and this principle is true for the first one where it is listen here amen amen in order to understand the wealth of meaning foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I want seven volunteers come here I want to demonstrate this come on amen amen thank you I want to demonstrate this so that you can see it amen amen so uh I want you to stand here and put no put your hand no like this like this okay extend until we have the gap foreign they fight the battle but why not they overcome and now they come down here are you understanding now now after this one see overcome this church is no more and the Believers are now again [Music] foreign it is gathered up in here in the first church they were commissioned to act a certain way and now they would act that way but when they overcome they are no longer the last age then they come into the next one and they are given instructions again on top of what they had they keep what they have that's this one then they become the next time when they come here it's the growth of the church and now right here is the fullness of the grass of the Church of the Lord are you together much as it looks like there are seven chances it's actually one growing Church foreign [Applause] [Music] what has been said about each age [Music] amen Amina so all the sovereign [Music] amen Amina we continue with the court tonight there is [Music] amen when you are Roofing your house you don't do this talk a lot you do this amen amen so the life color of them of this previous age begins to face into the coming one and the life of the other Edge begins to come over here foreign [Music] [Music] until [Music] subscribe [Music] amen amen so the seventh age and yet all the reality of Pentacles once Philadelphia has but run its course Philadelphia [Music] foreign amen Amina the preachers then the prophet also quotes necessary first bind the prayers [Music] yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of the sovereign foreign [Music] amen amen so the minister of the good suffers is what you know separates the uh Pentecost and the bridge amen amen you are Fielding whatever no Spirit here can come to destroy you is praise God amen amen so in The Exodus Moses always stood in the bridge are you together with him he always truth this is between Egypt and the promise do you realize that yeah Moses would stand in the garden for the people many times they would have seen But Moses would stand in there as Grace amen Amina yes sir listen to Psalms 106 23. therefore he said that he would destroy them had not Moses is chosen stood before him in the bridge to turn away his wrath unless they should destroyed them I send that to you Elijah the prophet before the great Android not stood in the bridge over and over Moses took his position in the bridge [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the prophet not be amen amen praise God so in this bridge that comes down Christopher as the repair of the bridge because to begin with no man was found worthy to stand in this bridge [Music] God comes in literally on the buses of Grace simply because we have hacked into the voices [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the bridge foreign [Music] [Music] will be the revelation of the ministry of Grace amen Amina he says the end the spoken word is the original see God is taking the English out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid and finishing up the world it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word the word itself gambo [Music] did you get that he says he's pulling you out because you are part of the world you are a written episode together we shall be the completion of the world and then the word himself will come and Unite with us Believers are you here can I hear you are you that word foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen I mean it becomes so simple we know that the rest of the world can stumble at it but it's always I will take you that into the career for you to understand that to work in the bridge he works it's going to be so easy so the only thing that you need it's subject to the instructions and look like you can't but when you take the first step there will come power for you to take the seconds that you will start working and all of a sudden you will be normal foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] there was a was a a tree right on the right also a tree amen Amina and so he says a pipe came from the left and another and also from the tree do you know what those trees they are workers to produce are you together so now this candle here does not struggle to look for the oil after are you together with it what is it it's just us to be connected and now the Fire doesn't belong to the candidates is God from the holy place and from this week then they light to the next one the next one the next one foreign amen Amina but this kind of here is the candle of Britain work are you together a God that has been beaten and tested in fire praise God that's how they always made the candle they would bring a block of gold amen Amina and they would beat it and as they keep beating foreign [Music] [Music] and you are so malleable has [Music] [Music] [Music] to be found perfect I know what anywhere of Perfect characters because she has gone through the edges connected to the two Olive Tree yes [Music] foreign [Music] this is the word of the Lord and to the Republic not by might nor by power was not by my spirit says it's going to be it will not be AST in yourself you are not the one who rebukes yourself [Music] are you together with me so the work in this bridge is God revealing himself in simplistics by releasing promises somebody sent me something on WhatsApp and then there were this little babies and they were crawling babies so they wanted them to run their race so the parents were at the finishing life and now these parents were calling me so that these kids could grow in competition some others would get in the middle [Music] others again they would start crawling I know there was this one who was so close to the finishing life and it was not finished he ended up and the mother was saying yeah so the mother knew what this kid liked most of them and the girl to the finishing that's the way God works he puts incentives [Music] that we may run the rest amen he puts before us precious Promises of the world and as we desire those promises [Music] that's how he's working with us [Music] are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this we might be partakers of the divine nature are you together with me promises we may become partakers and you're going to looking at what the word says talking to God then you are getting closer [Music] you are feeling sick you've gone into the promises therefore [Music] [Music] to finish [Music] he's talking about [Music] the end of the journey the bridge is going to be a day of support God hidden and revealed in simplicity [Music] that's the bridge it will be so easy for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of the Roomba Bell with those sevens they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth amen amen he says in this time it will be the time of the coming down of The Headstone he's calling this day the day of small things that it fully confuses the wise and the Prudence is amen [Music] do you understand what I'm saying and the planet here is actually a plum line that Zechariah is calling the planet and he says it will have the eyes of the seven it is [Music] the seven Messengers actually you know as we saw every age facing into the Earth one of those Messengers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] will it be different [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a gap God foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I mean hallelujah hallelujah
