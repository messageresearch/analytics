[0:16] I he
[0:22] know it was the blood.
[0:27] Oh,
[0:30] I know it was his grace.
[0:36] I know
[0:39] his grace. I know it was his grace for
[0:47] me.
[0:50] Oh,
[0:52] one day when I was lost, surely
[0:58] died on the cross.
[1:02] Oh, I know it was his grace for
[1:09] Oh, I know it was his love.
[1:16] I know
[1:20] his love. I know. He was his love for
[1:28] me. Halleluah.
[1:32] Oh, one day when I was lost,
[1:38] he died upon that cross.
[1:43] Oh, I know it was his love
[1:49] for me.
[1:52] Precious heavenly father,
[1:55] &gt;&gt; we are so grateful Lord
[1:59] &gt;&gt; to know that it was your grace
[2:03] that it was your love
[2:06] that sent down grace
[2:10] to come and save us. Lord,
[2:13] we appreciate you, heavenly father,
[2:17] for your love toward us, oh God.
[2:20] And Lord God,
[2:22] Because of your love,
[2:25] you have allowed us once again
[2:29] to come in your presence this evening.
[2:32] We are such a blessed people
[2:35] that we can come and have fellowship
[2:37] with you.
[2:39] And Lord God, upon the foundation of
[2:42] your grace,
[2:45] we approach you tonight
[2:48] seeking for righteousness,
[2:51] seeking for renewal,
[2:55] seeking for refilling of the Holy
[2:57] Spirit,
[3:00] seeking that Lord we may find you at our
[3:02] points of need.
[3:06] Father Lord, we pray
[3:09] like you gave us a promise,
[3:12] you gave us a covenant
[3:15] that each time we are gathered together
[3:19] and we are more than one
[3:22] that you shall surely be in our midst
[3:25] to take our prayer
[3:28] to take our cries
[3:30] to all our needs
[3:33] and accept us for who we are in your
[3:36] presence.
[3:37] We trust that Lord your presence is here
[3:40] with us.
[3:42] Oh precious father. How we thank you for
[3:45] the inter congregation
[3:47] that you have brought to come and have
[3:49] fellowship and communion with you Lord
[3:52] as we get closer to the table.
[3:56] We pray heavenly father Lord you may
[3:57] come and dine with us.
[4:00] Open our eyes oh God that we may be able
[4:04] to see. Open our ears, oh God, that we
[4:08] may hearken to thy word tonight. And may
[4:11] you, Lord, open our hearts,
[4:13] that we may have faith enough to believe
[4:15] your word.
[4:17] I believe that Lord God
[4:20] when you speak, we shall be able to
[4:23] hear. Bless us all together
[4:27] that we may receive a blessing.
[4:30] We pray for our pastors
[4:32] wherever they have gone to minister.
[4:35] Lord God, may you bless them out there.
[4:38] Bless their hearts, oh God.
[4:41] Bless them with good health.
[4:44] And Lord God, for the entire
[4:45] congregation of this local church,
[4:48] we give them all unto you.
[4:51] those that have not been able to come
[4:53] for the fellowship,
[4:55] bless them, oh God, that Lord, next time
[4:58] them they may be able to come
[5:01] and die together with us. Even as Lord,
[5:04] we approach the reading of the word.
[5:06] We pray for your special blessing.
[5:09] Bless this word, oh God. Bless us all
[5:12] together and take all the speak at night
[5:16] away
[5:18] that you may use him just as a vessel.
[5:22] Father to reach out a message
[5:25] that you have for us
[5:27] for the glory of your holy name. We
[5:30] bless you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[5:34] Amen. Amen.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Are you happen to
[5:38] be in the house of the Lord?
[5:41] Amen. Let's turn to our Bibles
[5:45] in the book of Ephesians.
[5:48] We shall read chapter one.
[5:51] And we shall start from verse one
[5:55] up to verse seven.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; The scripture says
[6:08] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[6:11] of God to the saints which are at
[6:13] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[6:16] Jesus.
[6:26] Grace,
[6:28] grace be to you. Sorry.
[6:32] Grace be to you and peace from our Lord
[6:35] from our from God our father and from
[6:38] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[6:43] [Music]
[6:48] Blessed be the God and father of our
[6:51] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[6:54] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[6:56] places in Christ.
[7:07] according as he has chosen us in him
[7:09] before the foundation of the world that
[7:11] we should be holy and without blame
[7:13] before him in love
[7:25] having predestinated us unto the
[7:27] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[7:30] himself according to the good pleasure
[7:32] of his will.
[7:44] To the praise of the glory of his grace,
[7:47] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[7:50] beloved.
[7:59] In whom we have redemption through his
[8:02] blood, the forgiveness of sins according
[8:05] to the riches of his grace.
[8:17] May the Lord bless his word. We may get
[8:19] seated.
[8:22] I want to greet you all in the name of
[8:24] Jesus Christ
[8:27] and I want to appreciate you for coming
[8:30] to be part of the fellowship.
[8:34] Amen. Amen.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Our pastors are not with us.
[8:38] Pastor James has moved with a visit to
[8:44] have services there.
[8:46] Amen. Amen. So we keep them in prayer.
[8:49] Do you love him?
[8:51] Amen. Amen.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; So we have taken our scriptures.
[8:57] in the book of Ephesians
[9:00] where Paul speaks to the church
[9:05] and he gives an introduction
[9:08] that Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[9:13] by the will of God
[9:16] to the saints which are at Ephesus
[9:20] and to the rest of the faithful in
[9:23] Christ Jesus.
[9:26] And he gives a salutation.
[9:29] Grace be to you
[9:32] and peace from God our father
[9:37] from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the God and father of our
[9:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[9:47] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[9:50] blessings in heavenly places.
[9:57] in Christ.
[9:59] And now verse four,
[10:02] according as he has chosen us in him
[10:08] before the foundation of the world.
[10:12] According as he has chosen us,
[10:16] not as we have chosen to be,
[10:20] but according as he has chosen us.
[10:25] in him.
[10:27] Praise the Lord. He chose us in him
[10:32] before the foundation of the world
[10:35] that we should be holy.
[10:40] Praise the Lord. He predestinated our
[10:43] journey.
[10:45] First of all, he predestinated our being
[10:50] and he chose us in him.
[10:53] So that means we were in him
[10:57] before the foundation of the world. And
[11:00] because we were in him, so that he chose
[11:03] us in him.
[11:06] Praise the Lord before the foundation of
[11:08] the world that we should be holy and
[11:13] without blame
[11:18] before him in love.
[11:21] Praise the Lord. So tonight I want us to
[11:24] take a thought
[11:26] on how should we approach God?
[11:31] How do we approach God?
[11:34] Upon which basis,
[11:37] upon which foundation
[11:39] do we approach God?
[11:43] Praise the Lord. So we are often faced
[11:45] with so much around us.
[11:51] so many things around us
[11:54] in areas of need,
[11:58] need for righteousness,
[12:01] need for spiritual growth,
[12:04] need for victory over evil,
[12:09] need for healing of sicknesses,
[12:14] need to receive
[12:17] and so many areas.
[12:20] that necessitate us to run to God.
[12:24] And now the question is
[12:27] how best can we approach God?
[12:31] How best can I approach God
[12:37] which I want
[12:40] so he can attend to my need.
[12:43] Now the world has a principle.
[12:47] The world has a principle.
[12:50] Praise the Lord. They have a principle
[12:53] that for God to hear you,
[12:56] you must do something good
[13:00] or you must be good.
[13:03] Praise the Lord. So now those that are
[13:05] in the denominations,
[13:07] they also have a principle
[13:10] that for for you to be in good
[13:12] connections with God,
[13:16] you have to do something good.
[13:19] You have to do good.
[13:21] Praise the Lord. Or if you're in church,
[13:25] you can contribute towards building the
[13:27] church
[13:30] or you can contribute to all the needs
[13:31] of the church.
[13:35] You can find those that are in need
[13:39] and support them in order for you to
[13:42] receive something good from God.
[13:46] That is all fine because the principle
[13:50] of God, the principle of giving is
[13:54] receiving.
[13:56] When you give, you receive.
[13:58] And so when they receive something in
[14:00] return,
[14:02] they are convinced that they have re
[14:04] they have salvation.
[14:12] But that's not so. Praise the Lord. You
[14:15] cannot approach God because there is
[14:18] something you are going to do for God.
[14:22] Praise the Lord. You cannot say I am
[14:24] going to please God
[14:27] by only having something to do for him.
[14:31] What if there is nothing to give at all?
[14:35] Praise the Lord. So we do not approach
[14:38] God
[14:40] or we are not found of God
[14:43] because there is something that we can
[14:46] give to him.
[14:48] We are found of God
[14:51] because God himself chose us.
[14:56] Himself loved us.
[14:58] He chose us in him
[15:01] before the foundation of the world.
[15:05] That is the only principle
[15:08] that we have to be found of him.
[15:12] Praise the Lord. That he knew us
[15:15] and he chose us before the foundation of
[15:19] the world.
[15:21] That we should be holy.
[15:25] So the holiness that we have
[15:28] is not determined by your character.
[15:33] It's not determined by your good works.
[15:36] It's not determined by how much you are
[15:38] doing for God.
[15:41] He chose you to be holy
[15:45] in him before the foundation of the
[15:47] world
[15:49] to be holy without any blame.
[15:54] Blessed be the God and father of our
[15:56] Lord Jesus Christ
[16:01] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[16:03] blessings
[16:07] in heavenly places in Christ
[16:11] according as he has chosen us in him
[16:15] before the foundation of the world
[16:18] that we should be holy and without blame
[16:21] before him in love.
[16:26] Now listen to this verse. Having
[16:29] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[16:33] children.
[16:37] Praise the Lord. When he knew us,
[16:41] God knew us. God knew you. God knew me
[16:47] before the world was formed.
[16:50] And he did not end at knowing us.
[16:54] But he chose us in him
[16:58] to be a holy people.
[17:02] Praise the Lord to live without any
[17:04] blame in him.
[17:08] And then he predestinated us
[17:12] and to the adoption of children.
[17:16] Praise the Lord. predestinated
[17:21] set aside.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; He knew us by for knowledge and set
[17:28] aside
[17:30] because we are a special people.
[17:34] Praise the Lord. We are going to live a
[17:37] special life.
[17:40] A life that manifests the love of God.
[17:45] A love that manifests the will of God.
[17:50] The life that manifests
[17:53] the life of God himself.
[17:56] And now he he and the Bible says he
[17:59] predestined us unto the adoption of
[18:02] children
[18:06] to be adopted.
[18:08] Praise the Lord. to be tutoed
[18:12] to be mentored.
[18:14] Praise the Lord. In the beginning,
[18:19] before the beginning,
[18:22] when God predestinated us,
[18:26] he set us aside to be adopted
[18:31] to be mentored
[18:34] into the children of God.
[18:38] One thing to be called
[18:41] and another thing to be mentored into
[18:44] becoming a child
[18:47] a child of God.
[18:50] Praise the Lord. How many parents are
[18:52] here?
[18:54] By show of hands. Praise the Lord.
[18:57] Around five parents and I am a parent
[19:00] too. And we produce children.
[19:04] So it's one thing to produce a child.
[19:08] When you produce a child, everybody will
[19:11] say, "Oh, this is Wilson's child.
[19:15] This is so and so's child."
[19:18] Because by birth, they are your
[19:19] children.
[19:21] Praise the Lord. As they grow,
[19:25] those children begin to manifest a
[19:28] character, a nature.
[19:31] So as a parent, if you don't take time
[19:35] to tutor your children,
[19:39] you do the thing that you want them to
[19:41] grow into
[19:44] when they grow up, people will begin to
[19:47] say,
[19:49] "This child has not behaved like his
[19:52] father.
[19:54] Why?" Because this child has not been
[19:57] tutoed.
[20:00] been taught.
[20:02] We have been brought up into the
[20:04] character of the father.
[20:08] God knew us.
[20:10] He chose us. He did not leave us there.
[20:15] He chose us and also thought of how we
[20:18] would become his children.
[20:22] Manifest the nature of God.
[20:26] To do that he had to bring Jesus Christ.
[20:31] So when the Bible says he has brought he
[20:33] has predestined us unto children
[20:38] the adoption of children
[20:42] by Jesus Christ
[20:45] the word of God. Praise the Lord. Now
[20:48] when he chose us and put us aside
[20:53] and he brings Jesus
[20:55] and presents us unto Jesus.
[20:58] Praise the Lord. So Jesus said, "No man
[21:02] can come to me
[21:04] except my father draw him unto me.
[21:08] It has to take the father."
[21:12] Praise the Lord, bring you out,
[21:16] set you aside,
[21:18] and then present you over to Jesus.
[21:22] Hallelujah.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Then you are adopted unto children by
[21:26] Jesus Christ.
[21:30] The word of God.
[21:32] Praise the Lord. That is the covenant
[21:35] that we have.
[21:37] That is the promise that we have
[21:40] upon which
[21:42] we can approach God.
[21:46] Praise the Lord. He has predestined us
[21:48] unto the adoption of children.
[21:52] Jesus Christ to himself
[21:56] according to the good pleasure of his
[21:58] will.
[22:00] Praise the Lord. So this is the secret.
[22:04] Not because of our good works,
[22:08] but because he loved you
[22:11] and he chose you in him
[22:14] to be adopted into children
[22:18] who he purchased by his own blood at
[22:20] Calvary.
[22:23] God meets us
[22:26] upon the basis of his promise
[22:30] upon the basis of his covenant,
[22:34] his unbreakable promises.
[22:38] And what is a covenant?
[22:41] A covenant is some sort of a promise
[22:45] between two parties.
[22:49] There is one who commits
[22:54] and then the other that receives.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now in his word,
[23:01] &gt;&gt; the Bible says he has chosen us.
[23:05] So he made a choice.
[23:08] That is a covenant choice.
[23:11] Praise the Lord. To be adopted unto
[23:14] children in him.
[23:17] So now it becomes his responsibility.
[23:23] to tutor us and to the children that he
[23:27] wants to have for himself.
[23:31] It takes God himself
[23:34] to tutor you.
[23:36] Praise the Lord. The Bible calls him the
[23:39] porter.
[23:42] He calls him the porter.
[23:46] A porter is a man with a vision.
[23:51] a vision to come out with a piece.
[23:56] Then he gets the clay
[23:59] and begins to mold the clay according to
[24:02] his vision that he has seen.
[24:08] And so if it's not coming out well,
[24:12] breaks it and molds it again.
[24:16] That is what our God does to us.
[24:20] Praise the Lord. He's adopting us into
[24:23] children.
[24:26] And in so doing, he's molding us
[24:29] to become that which he wants to see in
[24:32] us.
[24:35] Praise the Lord. The praise of his
[24:37] glory.
[24:40] Praise the Lord. And whatever he's
[24:42] doing, he has always had a blueprint.
[24:48] This blueprint the Bible has said
[24:52] knew us
[24:54] before the foundation of the world.
[24:57] So there was a blueprint
[25:00] of which God created each one of us
[25:04] and each one of us has to be molded
[25:08] to the likeness of the image that God
[25:11] has in mind for us.
[25:15] Let's look at how God has always met his
[25:17] people.
[25:19] God always meets his people
[25:22] on the basis of a covenant.
[25:25] The book of Exodus
[25:28] chapter 6
[25:30] from verse 6 downwards.
[25:34] Wherefore say unto the children of
[25:36] Israel,
[25:37] I am the Lord
[25:40] and I will bring you out from under the
[25:42] burdens of the Egyptians, and I will
[25:45] read you out of their bondage, and I
[25:47] will redeem you with a stretched out
[25:50] arm, and with great judgments.
[25:53] 66
[26:06] [Music]
[26:14] [Music]
[26:22] Now, this is a the word of God
[26:26] that God was speaking to Moses.
[26:31] He says, "I redeem you with a stretched
[26:33] out arm."
[26:37] Verse seven, "I will make I will take
[26:39] you to be I will take you to me for a
[26:43] people.
[26:49] I will be to you a god,
[26:53] and ye shall know that I am the Lord
[26:56] your God,
[27:01] which brings you out from under the
[27:04] burdens of the Egyptians.
[27:08] I will take you to me.
[27:12] Not that they will come by themselves to
[27:15] me.
[27:18] I will put in all the effort
[27:22] to bring you to me.
[27:26] Praise the Lord. Uncontrollably,
[27:30] praise the Lord. The children of Israel
[27:34] did not have control over this promise.
[27:39] It is God that made the promise
[27:42] and it is God that had to make the
[27:45] promise come to pass.
[27:48] Praise the Lord. And he made a promise
[27:50] to us that he chose us
[27:54] before the foundation of the world.
[27:57] Praise the Lord. We are predestinated
[28:00] unto the adoption of children.
[28:05] Praise the Lord. So we have no control
[28:08] over that.
[28:10] It is God that has spoken the word.
[28:14] It is God that shall fulfill the word.
[28:18] Trust and obey.
[28:22] That's all that we have.
[28:25] Trust and obey.
[28:28] When you hear the word of God,
[28:31] you believe it and you trust God for the
[28:35] word which he has spoken.
[28:38] Then you obey his word.
[28:41] It is him that has called you to
[28:43] himself.
[28:44] And he has called you unto the adoption
[28:47] of children.
[28:49] And because he has called you,
[28:52] it is his responsibility
[28:57] upon you to make you his child.
[29:02] And what makes you his child
[29:05] is when you have the same life as Jesus
[29:08] Christ.
[29:11] When the life of God is in you.
[29:15] And what is the life of God? What is
[29:17] that life?
[29:20] is the Holy Spirit in us.
[29:23] Praise the living God. I will bring you
[29:26] I will take you to me for a people
[29:31] and I will beat you a God.
[29:35] It's a promise. It's a covenant. And
[29:39] when God speaks,
[29:41] he fulfills his promise
[29:46] and he says
[29:48] and and and ye shall know that I am the
[29:52] Lord your God.
[29:56] Praise the Lord. First, you are out
[29:59] there without any knowledge that he knew
[30:04] before the foundation of the world.
[30:07] Somehow
[30:09] locates you. Praise the Lord. Because in
[30:13] his blueprints,
[30:15] you are a part of his plan.
[30:19] Praise the Lord. When the time was come
[30:22] and he looked at his blueprint
[30:26] and he saw you regardless of where you
[30:30] were.
[30:32] Praise the Lord. Regardless of which
[30:34] family you were born into,
[30:37] he located you and he brought you to
[30:39] himself.
[30:42] I will bring you to me.
[30:46] I will be your God.
[30:50] You shall be my people.
[30:53] Praise the Lord. That is a promise. That
[30:57] is a covenant. And we can always remind
[31:00] God,
[31:03] it's you that called me to yourself.
[31:07] I didn't know that there was a God.
[31:10] I didn't know that there was a healer.
[31:14] I didn't know that there was a miracle
[31:15] worker
[31:19] yourself. You also taught me that you
[31:22] are my God.
[31:25] Praise the Lord. So when you are
[31:27] approaching God,
[31:29] you must approach God upon his very
[31:32] promises.
[31:35] Praise the Lord. He says, "I will be a
[31:37] God to you.
[31:39] I am the Lord your God.
[31:42] I will bring you out from under the
[31:44] burdens of the Egyptians.
[31:47] I am the Lord God who keeps you from all
[31:50] the burdens of wickedness.
[31:53] I am the Lord God
[31:56] you from wherever situation you are in
[32:00] brought you to myself. So now you become
[32:03] my burden.
[32:05] We are his responsibility.
[32:10] Your salvation is the responsibility of
[32:13] God.
[32:15] Praise the Lord. Your eternal life
[32:18] is the responsibility
[32:21] of God. Why? because he called it
[32:24] himself.
[32:25] You knew nothing about it.
[32:28] But he called you himself and says, "I
[32:31] have brought you to me
[32:34] now from hence forth.
[32:37] I shall be your God."
[32:40] Praise the Lord. A God,
[32:43] not a God in one situation,
[32:46] not a God in all,
[32:50] a God of your salvation,
[32:52] a God of your victories,
[32:55] a God of your battles,
[32:58] a God when you in lack,
[33:01] a God of everything about you.
[33:07] It says, "And I will bring you in, I
[33:09] will bring you in unto the land
[33:13] concerning the which I did swear to give
[33:15] to Abraham,
[33:18] to Isaac,
[33:20] and to Jacob.
[33:22] I'll give it to you for an inheritance.
[33:27] I am the Lord."
[33:30] He had made a promise
[33:32] to Abraham.
[33:34] Praise the Lord. I will bless your seed.
[33:38] I will drive them to a stray land
[33:41] and after an appointed time
[33:44] according to his blueprint,
[33:47] I will again bring them out
[33:51] and I will give them a land. So now when
[33:55] he was speaking to Moses,
[33:57] he was referring to his covenant.
[34:02] He was referring to the covenant he made
[34:04] with Abraham.
[34:08] But when he covenants,
[34:11] he's bound to fulfill his covenant.
[34:15] When God makes a promise,
[34:18] he is obligated to make his promise come
[34:22] to pass
[34:24] regardless of how.
[34:27] And when God fulfills his promise
[34:32] and in Exodus chapter 19 verse 5
[34:37] says, "Now therefore,
[34:39] if you will obey my voice
[34:44] indeed and keep my covenant,
[34:48] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[34:52] unto me above all people.
[35:09] Praise the Lord. according as he has
[35:12] chosen us in him
[35:15] before the foundation of the world.
[35:18] If we obey his covenant,
[35:22] if we obey his words,
[35:26] if we accept the tutoring,
[35:29] adoption unto children
[35:33] says, when you obey my voice,
[35:37] my word,
[35:40] praise the Lord, it shall be a peculiar
[35:43] treasure unto me above all the people.
[35:50] Now let's conceptualize this.
[35:53] It is him that does the choosing.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It is him without any
[36:02] choice. We don't have a choice of that
[36:06] and then he makes the choosing.
[36:10] After making the choosing, he
[36:12] predestinates
[36:15] and sets aside
[36:17] and then he lays principles
[36:20] upon which we are to be adopted unto
[36:22] children.
[36:26] And then he says, we shall be brought
[36:28] unto adoption
[36:32] by Jesus Christ my word,
[36:36] by Jesus Christ my covenant.
[36:39] And then he gives us his covenant.
[36:42] And then he says, "When you obey this,
[36:44] my covenant,
[36:48] when you obey this, my voice,
[36:52] and you keep this my covenant, my word,
[36:58] then you shall be a peculiar people.
[37:02] You shall be a special people."
[37:05] Praise the Lord. Only if you obey. And
[37:08] he says, "And ye shall be unto me a
[37:11] kingdom of priests."
[37:23] [Music]
[37:25] Praise the Lord. It shall be unto me a
[37:27] kingdom
[37:30] of priests.
[37:32] Praise the Lord. He has chosen you. Then
[37:35] he's saying, when you obey my word
[37:41] that I have called you and I've given
[37:44] you a message
[37:46] to tutor you unto the adoption of
[37:48] children
[37:51] and he says I shall make you a kingdom
[37:55] of priests unto me
[38:00] that ye shall do something to be made a
[38:03] kingdom
[38:07] you have to do. He says if you obey,
[38:12] praise the Lord. So you are not going to
[38:14] struggle
[38:15] to come unto the kingdom.
[38:18] Trust and obey
[38:21] if you obey my commandment.
[38:24] Obey my covenant.
[38:26] I will make you a kingdom unto me
[38:30] and holy nation.
[38:32] These are the words which thou shalt
[38:34] speak unto the children of Israel.
[38:39] Praise the Lord. And in Leviticus 26
[38:42] verse 12,
[38:50] and I will walk among you,
[38:53] and I will be your God,
[38:57] and you shall be my people.
[39:01] Praise the Lord. Leviticus 26:12.
[39:19] [Music]
[39:24] Praise the Lord. That's where we as we
[39:27] can see ourselves.
[39:29] That's where every Christian must see
[39:32] themselves.
[39:35] First of all, you had no choice to be
[39:38] chosen.
[39:40] Praise the Lord. Then when he chose us,
[39:43] he has his plan
[39:46] to mature us into the kingdom.
[39:50] He says, "I will make you a kingdom unto
[39:52] me."
[39:54] Not a kingdom of regular people.
[39:59] the kingdom of priests unto me.
[40:04] And then when you obey my covenant,
[40:08] I will walk among you
[40:12] and will be your God,
[40:16] and he shall be my people.
[40:19] I am the Lord your God,
[40:22] which brought you forth out of the land
[40:24] of Egypt,
[40:27] that you should not be in their bondman.
[40:32] And I have broken the bands of your yoke
[40:35] and made you go upright.
[40:43] This was a promise
[40:45] to the Exodus.
[40:48] Praise the Lord. Which was a physical
[40:51] manifestation.
[40:53] But then we know that that type the
[40:56] spiritual exodus
[41:00] when the Lord brings us out of Egypt,
[41:04] by his own will,
[41:07] by his own hand,
[41:09] by his fornowledge,
[41:12] he knew that we were still in there.
[41:16] Then he walked in by himself
[41:19] and said, "Scalop, today
[41:22] I'm taking you to myself
[41:25] and you shall be mine
[41:27] and you shall be my people,
[41:30] I shall be a God to you."
[41:33] And he says, "When you obey this my
[41:35] word,
[41:37] I will be your God
[41:40] and I will make you a special people to
[41:43] me.
[41:46] priest,
[41:48] a kingdom of priests.
[41:51] When you accepted the word,
[41:54] I accepted the word. When I obey the
[41:57] word, he makes me a priest in his
[42:00] kingdom.
[42:03] He creates a special kingdom.
[42:07] Holy people
[42:10] there,
[42:12] he calls them priests.
[42:15] Praise the Lord. So you are not a
[42:17] regular people.
[42:19] You are a priest
[42:22] only if you believe.
[42:24] Praise the Lord. If you believe that you
[42:26] are a priest
[42:28] in the kingdom, then you are.
[42:32] Praise the Lord. How many people believe
[42:34] that they are priests in the kingdom of
[42:36] God?
[42:38] If you believe that you are a priest
[42:42] upon your confession
[42:45] and God makes you his own
[42:48] obey my word
[42:51] and then you confess my word.
[42:54] How do we believe?
[42:56] We hear the word of God. We hear that
[42:59] God
[43:01] in his forn knowledge
[43:03] he had us in him.
[43:06] He thought about us. We were in his mind
[43:11] before the foundation of the world.
[43:14] For heaven and earth, we were made.
[43:16] And God went ahead.
[43:21] Praise the Lord. Then when you know, you
[43:24] hear the word speaking about your
[43:27] salvation.
[43:29] And then you obey and believe.
[43:32] He says, "I will be a God unto you
[43:38] and ye shall be my people." I did not
[43:42] end there. But says, "And I will walk
[43:46] among you
[43:49] according as he has chosen us in him
[43:53] before the whole nation of the world.
[43:56] He has predestinated us
[44:00] and to the adoption of children by Jesus
[44:03] Christ.
[44:06] And I will walk among you.
[44:10] Jesus Christ, the word of God,
[44:14] when he makes us his kingdom,
[44:18] which we are
[44:21] by virtue of our faith in his word
[44:25] by virtue of our position in the word,
[44:29] a special kingdom. So now he walks
[44:33] amongst us
[44:35] by Jesus Christ,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[44:40] Praise the Lord. I walk among you. I
[44:43] will be your God.
[44:46] The children of Israel.
[44:48] Indeed, he walked amongst them.
[44:51] By day there was a cloud
[44:55] and in the night there was a pillar of
[44:58] fire
[45:00] and they could feel his presence
[45:03] in their midst. Praise the Lord. us. You
[45:07] will not see a cloud of a cloud.
[45:11] A pillar of fire.
[45:13] The pillar of fire is now in me.
[45:18] It's now in you. The word of God. God
[45:22] lives within us.
[45:25] Praise the Lord. And I walk among you
[45:29] by my word.
[45:31] Jesus Christ.
[45:33] Praise the Lord. and says, "I am the
[45:35] Lord your God
[45:38] that brought you out of the land of
[45:40] Egypt."
[45:42] Praise the Lord. And now the Bible says
[45:44] here in Deuteronomy 7:E1
[45:51] still speak about those covenants,
[45:54] the promises that he made.
[45:57] So now when he made those promises,
[45:59] he made them to Abraham,
[46:02] he made them to Isaac, he made them to
[46:05] to Jacob.
[46:07] But now here was the time of
[46:10] fulfillment.
[46:13] And now we don't have a good record
[46:17] of the behavior of the children of
[46:19] Israel
[46:21] at the time when they were coming out of
[46:23] Egypt.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They were a stiff naked
[46:28] people. They were a stiff naked people.
[46:33] They were handy.
[46:36] They had all sorts of bad behavior.
[46:41] Today they could see God make a miracle
[46:43] in the ministry.
[46:46] Tomorrow when he delays to come,
[46:49] they c him. They were impatient.
[46:53] Praise the Lord. And I can tell you
[46:56] brothers,
[46:58] God did not move them to Canaan
[47:02] because of their righteousness.
[47:06] God did not lead the children of Israel.
[47:09] Did not lead them out of Egypt,
[47:13] out of bondage,
[47:15] out of suffering
[47:17] because of their righteousness.
[47:20] No, not because they were doing
[47:22] something good for God.
[47:26] But because God had made a covenant,
[47:31] God had made a covenant with with
[47:34] Abraham,
[47:36] Isaac and Jacob.
[47:39] So whatever God was doing at this time,
[47:44] he was looking up to his covenant.
[47:47] Praise the Lord. So whatever God was
[47:49] doing in their camp
[47:53] looked at their behavior
[47:56] looking at their character
[47:58] a bad people
[48:02] God was determined
[48:04] to create a nation out of them.
[48:08] Praise the Lord. God determined
[48:11] to send down Jesus Christ
[48:14] to come and die
[48:17] so he could purchase us by his own
[48:20] blood.
[48:23] The covenant that he made.
[48:26] Praise the Lord. So when he comes down
[48:29] to look for you
[48:31] to look for me to bring salvation,
[48:35] it is not looking at how good you have
[48:37] been.
[48:39] Praise the Lord. We are saved
[48:44] by grace. We are saved by his love
[48:49] because he loved us.
[48:52] Praise the Lord. So now whatever they
[48:54] did in the camp,
[48:57] each time he was angry with them,
[49:01] he remembered the covenant
[49:04] which he made to Abraham.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:08] It's time they committed crimes.
[49:13] He looked at them with fury.
[49:16] Then the covenant came
[49:19] and he remembered his covenant.
[49:23] He says, I have chosen you.
[49:25] Praise the Lord. I have chosen you to
[49:28] myself.
[49:30] Yes,
[49:32] in his choosing.
[49:34] He never said you are going to be all
[49:37] through.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when he chose us, he
[49:43] also made a way
[49:46] for our victories,
[49:48] the blood of Jesus Christ. That's why he
[49:52] said
[49:54] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:56] children by Jesus Christ.
[50:00] He made a way for us to be perfect each
[50:04] time we go wrong.
[50:07] He put the blood of Jesus Christ.
[50:10] Praise the Lord. So when the enemy comes
[50:13] and he strikes you
[50:17] that there is the blood covenant,
[50:20] praise the Lord. Satan comes and he
[50:24] squeezes into the wall.
[50:27] Don't forget that there is a covenant.
[50:31] Remind the devil
[50:33] as much as you have rolled me to the
[50:35] mud.
[50:37] But there is a blood covenant.
[50:41] I don't belong here. I shall march
[50:44] upright to the blood covenant.
[50:48] I shall dip my myself in the blood
[50:52] and I shall be whole.
[50:54] according as he has predestinated us in
[50:57] him
[51:00] of children
[51:03] holy
[51:05] without any blame in him.
[51:08] Praise the Lord. I have called you. I
[51:12] shall be your God.
[51:15] I shall be your God
[51:18] and you shall be my people.
[51:21] Deuteronomy 7 verse 6.
[51:28] For thou art an holy people unto the
[51:30] Lord thy God.
[51:33] The Lord thy God has chosen thee
[51:37] to be a special people unto himself,
[51:42] above all people that are upon the face
[51:45] of the earth.
[51:48] And the Lord did not set his love upon
[51:51] you,
[51:54] nor choose you. The Lord did not put his
[51:57] love upon you,
[52:00] nor choose you
[52:03] because you were more in number
[52:08] than any people.
[52:10] For we were you were the fewest of all.
[52:16] He chose you.
[52:18] Praise the Lord. Because of his love,
[52:21] because of his fornowledge
[52:23] because of his eternal plan,
[52:27] his eternal plan,
[52:30] we were there.
[52:33] We were in him. There's no condition to
[52:36] disregard.
[52:38] We do not have any ground to say God
[52:40] chose us
[52:43] because we had something special about
[52:45] us.
[52:47] It was just his grace that located us
[52:53] and his love draw drew us towards him.
[52:59] Praise the living God. Verse eight says,
[53:03] "But because the Lord loved you,
[53:08] because he would keep the oath which he
[53:11] had sworn unto your fathers,
[53:16] always has a covenant to look up to.
[53:22] And once he makes it covenant,
[53:25] it to becomes his guide
[53:28] to execute his plans.
[53:31] Praise the Lord. He has chosen us as a
[53:34] people to himself.
[53:37] And he has called us by his fornowledge.
[53:41] He has predestinated us
[53:44] and ordained us
[53:47] and to a special people,
[53:50] his kingdom.
[53:53] No matter what the devil does to your
[53:56] life,
[53:59] God will always look at his eternal plan
[54:02] for you.
[54:05] He will look down to you
[54:08] and he will lift you up to himself.
[54:11] And by all means
[54:14] shall reach home
[54:17] because that is in his eternal thoughts.
[54:20] In the eternal thoughts of God,
[54:24] you are his bride.
[54:26] In eternal thoughts of God,
[54:31] you are a holy people.
[54:33] Regardless of how the devil fights so
[54:36] hard,
[54:38] God shall bring you to himself
[54:42] and shall present unto himself a bride
[54:46] that has no spot or wrinkle.
[54:49] Praise the Lord. Only trust and obey.
[54:54] Praise the Lord. Only trust him and obey
[54:58] his covenant.
[55:00] When the children of God went to worship
[55:02] him,
[55:04] In the times of Job,
[55:06] Satan also went with them.
[55:10] Satan always looks for the children of
[55:12] God.
[55:15] Some of them fail
[55:17] because he doesn't know,
[55:20] the eternal plans of God for your life.
[55:24] When he sees that God has chosen you
[55:28] and now he has set you aside
[55:32] and he has made you a special people
[55:35] brother, sister
[55:37] regardless of your way or your condition
[55:39] of life.
[55:42] You are a special people.
[55:45] You are a peculiar nation.
[55:48] God has called you by your name.
[55:53] When you approaching him, you approach
[55:56] him upon that covenant.
[56:00] It is you that chose me.
[56:03] It is you that called me.
[56:06] Here is my need.
[56:09] Praise the Lord. Because he called you.
[56:12] He has to supply for your needs.
[56:16] So when there is a need, you present the
[56:18] need to him and say, "God,
[56:21] you that called me
[56:23] And it is you that has to supply for
[56:26] this my need
[56:29] to run to the other gods
[56:33] have to come back to you.
[56:37] God upon the basis of his covenant with
[56:40] your life
[56:43] shall come to your rescue. Remember the
[56:46] children of Israel
[56:48] when God had called Moses and Moses had
[56:52] moved with Joshua.
[56:54] Moses had gone to receive the
[56:56] commandments.
[56:58] And now when people were down here,
[57:05] remember when God came down upon Mount
[57:08] Sai,
[57:10] there was so many uh there was the there
[57:12] was the presence of God.
[57:15] And there were thunders.
[57:18] There were lightnings on the mountain.
[57:20] And the people noticed that God had come
[57:23] down.
[57:25] Then they said, "For us, we cannot go up
[57:27] there.
[57:30] Moses, you go and represent us,
[57:33] then come and tell us what he has said."
[57:36] They were waiting.
[57:38] But Satan,
[57:40] praise the Lord, did not leave them.
[57:44] Satan was in the midst.
[57:46] So now he came and began convincing
[57:50] them.
[57:51] Be aware of false doctrines.
[57:56] Be aware of false prophets.
[57:59] If they don't speak this my word,
[58:03] speaks anything outside the word,
[58:07] do not believe them
[58:10] regardless of how nice they speak.
[58:14] how nice they are.
[58:17] They are not speaking the word of God
[58:22] them.
[58:24] Now Israel when they heard the
[58:26] murmurings
[58:29] what Moses has delayed
[58:34] the priest Aaron
[58:36] make us a god
[58:39] that we can worship
[58:42] maybe the other god has is not going to
[58:44] come to us
[58:47] yet they had seen him come down
[58:51] but Satan came along with them.
[58:55] When the children of God went to worship
[58:59] went along with them,
[59:02] what is the purpose
[59:04] to convert you from the plans of God?
[59:09] They made the cal
[59:11] and they began to worship and they're
[59:14] very happy and he was shouting.
[59:16] So now Moses was coming down with the
[59:19] two tablets that God had given him.
[59:25] Now when he came down, he heard a noise
[59:29] and he thought people were shouting for
[59:31] joy.
[59:33] When he came down, he was asking, God
[59:37] told him, "Your people have been
[59:41] corrupted.
[59:43] The enemy has overpowered them."
[59:48] They have forgotten their position in
[59:51] the kingdom.
[59:53] They have been begun to worship other
[59:56] gods.
[59:58] They have become so weak to forget
[1:00:03] how far the Lord has brought them.
[1:00:08] They've become so weak to forget
[1:00:12] the things that God has done for them.
[1:00:17] We ask God for grace
[1:00:19] that we don't get to a position
[1:00:22] where we shall doubt the hand of the
[1:00:25] Lord
[1:00:28] and forget
[1:00:30] how far God has brought us
[1:00:34] regardless of the situation
[1:00:37] to stand our grounds
[1:00:40] and know our position in the kingdom.
[1:00:44] Israel for God.
[1:00:47] God said, "I am going to destroy them.
[1:00:52] I'm going to destroy all the people
[1:00:55] and to you Moses only
[1:00:58] and and and Joshua, I'm going to make a
[1:01:00] great nation."
[1:01:02] And now Moses looked at God
[1:01:06] and said, "God,
[1:01:09] are you listening to yourself?
[1:01:12] Have you forgotten?
[1:01:14] There is a blueprint
[1:01:16] upon which this entire plan is moving.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Have you forgotten
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; that you have a covenant
[1:01:25] that you made with with with Abraham?
[1:01:29] Have you forgotten that you promised
[1:01:31] Isaac?
[1:01:33] Have you forgotten that you promised
[1:01:35] Jacob
[1:01:37] that he shall bless his seed?
[1:01:40] There shall be a great nation
[1:01:44] and destroy them. Where then shalt thou
[1:01:48] bring the great nation?
[1:01:51] Then God remembered and he looked back
[1:01:54] to the blueprint
[1:01:56] of the covenant.
[1:01:58] And then Moses stole him. Repent
[1:02:02] yourself of this thing which thou has
[1:02:05] spoken.
[1:02:10] Moses had a boldness
[1:02:14] to approach God.
[1:02:17] He knew there was a covenant
[1:02:20] that God had made for his people.
[1:02:23] Praise God. Regardless of how bad they
[1:02:26] had become,
[1:02:28] there was a covenant.
[1:02:31] There is a blood covenant.
[1:02:34] Praise the Lord. There is a blood
[1:02:36] covenant for you.
[1:02:38] We are a covenantal seed.
[1:02:42] Praise the Lord. So regardless of how
[1:02:44] hard the devil has hit you,
[1:02:48] raise up and remind God,
[1:02:51] I am a covenantal seed.
[1:02:54] I was purchased by your own blood
[1:02:57] and yet I knew nothing about it. I am
[1:03:00] here where I am. I am very confident
[1:03:04] that you cannot leave me at this spot
[1:03:08] because there is a promise.
[1:03:11] There is a covenant that there is a
[1:03:14] church
[1:03:15] that must be formed out of us and that
[1:03:19] church must be a special people.
[1:03:23] The bride
[1:03:25] shall have no spot or wrinkle.
[1:03:28] The devil has brought a spot on you.
[1:03:32] Praise the Lord. Wipe it off and apply
[1:03:36] the blood and say, "God, you gave the
[1:03:40] covenant.
[1:03:41] There has to be a church and that church
[1:03:45] is me." Praise the Lord. That church is
[1:03:49] you. That church is us. A curious
[1:03:54] people,
[1:03:56] a kingdom of priests.
[1:03:58] Praise the Lord. And let me just quote a
[1:04:01] few things here
[1:04:03] what the prophet says.
[1:04:05] There are so many scenarios
[1:04:08] where God has always respected his
[1:04:11] covenant.
[1:04:16] I've respected his covenant.
[1:04:18] I'll give you a small scenario before we
[1:04:20] close.
[1:04:22] Nemiah.
[1:04:24] In the days of Nehemiah,
[1:04:26] Israel was in captivity
[1:04:29] and Jerusalem had been captured.
[1:04:33] It had been surrounded.
[1:04:36] And now
[1:04:38] the Bible says in verse one verse one
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; the words of Nehemiah the son of Hasha.
[1:04:48] And it came to pass in the month of
[1:04:49] Chelse in the 20th year as I was in
[1:04:53] Susan the palace.
[1:04:59] They came here. Sorry.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Verse two, that Han
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; one of my brethren
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; came he and certain men of Judah.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And I asked them concerning the Jews
[1:05:18] that had escaped
[1:05:24] speaking
[1:05:26] which were left of the captivity and
[1:05:28] concerning Jerusalem.
[1:05:33] And they said unto me,
[1:05:36] the remnant
[1:05:38] that are left of the captivity
[1:05:41] there in the there in the promise are in
[1:05:44] great affliction and reproach.
[1:05:49] The wall of Jerusalem
[1:05:53] also is broken down
[1:05:56] and the gates thereof
[1:05:58] are burnt with fire.
[1:06:01] So he he felt so much pain
[1:06:05] because of the affliction of the people
[1:06:07] of God.
[1:06:10] And now in verse four,
[1:06:13] he sat down and began to speak to God.
[1:06:18] It says, "And it came to pass
[1:06:21] when I heard these words that I sat down
[1:06:25] and wept."
[1:06:29] How many of us have come such a time of
[1:06:32] affliction
[1:06:34] and sat down and feel confused?
[1:06:39] Remember that you have a God
[1:06:43] whom you can speak to your situation.
[1:06:47] He says, "I remembered,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; so I knelt down
[1:06:52] and wept and mourned certain days
[1:06:55] and fasted and prayed before the God of
[1:06:57] heaven.
[1:07:01] And I said,
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; I beseech thee, oh Lord, God of heaven,
[1:07:09] the great and terrible God,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; that kept covenant and mercy for them
[1:07:14] that love him and observe his
[1:07:16] commandments.
[1:07:22] And then he began to draw his attention
[1:07:24] to him
[1:07:27] to open his to open the ears.
[1:07:31] and open his eyes.
[1:07:36] And then he began to pray,
[1:07:38] say, "Hear the prayer of your servants,
[1:07:42] which I pray before you now,
[1:07:45] and the children of Israel, your
[1:07:47] servants,
[1:07:50] and confess the sins of the children of
[1:07:52] Israel."
[1:07:54] And in verse 8,
[1:07:57] remember
[1:07:59] I beseech thee the word that thou
[1:08:03] commandest thy servant Moses.
[1:08:07] Now he's reminding God
[1:08:10] of his covenants.
[1:08:13] Remember now
[1:08:15] the word that you commanded your servant
[1:08:18] Moses.
[1:08:21] He was referring God's
[1:08:25] blueprint.
[1:08:28] If you transgress,
[1:08:31] I will scatter you abroad
[1:08:34] among the nations.
[1:08:36] But if you turn unto me and keep my
[1:08:39] commandments
[1:08:42] and do them,
[1:08:45] there were of you cast out unto the
[1:08:48] utmost part of the heaven.
[1:08:58] yet will I gather them from this
[1:09:03] and will bring them unto the place that
[1:09:05] I have chosen to set my name there
[1:09:11] said when you turn
[1:09:13] but that was the covenant.
[1:09:16] So now Nehemiah had turned
[1:09:19] and was repenting on behalf of the
[1:09:22] people
[1:09:24] and he was reminding God
[1:09:27] the covenant he had made that when the
[1:09:30] people shall turn away
[1:09:33] from evil and come back to God
[1:09:37] his word
[1:09:39] according to his commandment
[1:09:42] he would bring them would gather them
[1:09:45] together
[1:09:46] and bring them to a place which he has
[1:09:49] chosen his name to be there.
[1:09:53] And what is that place? That place is
[1:09:56] you and me. We are the tabernacle of
[1:09:59] God. The tabernacle not made with hands.
[1:10:04] And so if we are a tabernacle,
[1:10:07] God has chosen his name
[1:10:11] in you and me. And so if he has chosen
[1:10:14] his name to be in you and me,
[1:10:18] he will protect his name
[1:10:21] only if we trust and obey.
[1:10:24] Praise the Lord. Let me read out a few
[1:10:27] of the quotes here.
[1:10:30] Praise the Lord. The prophet says
[1:10:33] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:10:38] who Christ Jesus.
[1:10:41] Jesus Christ the word,
[1:10:44] the word of God
[1:10:47] has chosen us in him
[1:10:50] and placed us in them positions as the
[1:10:53] elect of God
[1:10:56] and in the message
[1:10:58] the believer's position in Christ.
[1:11:02] Now if we can find our position
[1:11:07] and know that it is God's word that has
[1:11:09] promised it
[1:11:13] that is the reason Joshua and Calb
[1:11:17] had no fear that they could not take the
[1:11:19] promised land
[1:11:23] because all the rest of the nine came
[1:11:26] back
[1:11:29] and said we can't do
[1:11:33] Why those cities world high
[1:11:39] and we look like grasshoppers upside the
[1:11:41] people
[1:11:45] you are so big
[1:11:48] and they they are so big and they armed.
[1:11:52] You can't look at the sense of
[1:11:54] reasoning.
[1:11:57] You've got to look at the promise of
[1:12:00] God.
[1:12:03] These people are looking at the sense of
[1:12:05] reasoning.
[1:12:07] They were not looking at the promise
[1:12:10] that God had made.
[1:12:13] Joshua and
[1:12:16] were not looking at the sense of
[1:12:18] reasoning.
[1:12:20] They were not looking at the mountain
[1:12:22] set before them.
[1:12:25] They were looking at the covenant
[1:12:28] that God had made for them.
[1:12:32] We are not looking at the mountain set
[1:12:35] before us. Brothers,
[1:12:38] we must look at the covenant that God
[1:12:40] made for us.
[1:12:44] It means we must overcome.
[1:12:48] Why? Because Jesus Christ overcame.
[1:12:53] He overcame for us. Praise the Lord. He
[1:12:57] was taken up on the cross
[1:12:59] and all sickness,
[1:13:03] all sickness
[1:13:04] was upon him. When sickness strikes us,
[1:13:09] we should not become so weak to believe
[1:13:13] that all sickness was pinned down at the
[1:13:16] cross of Calvary.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We should not look at
[1:13:23] the mountain.
[1:13:25] We should look at the covenant.
[1:13:29] And he says, God look at the promise of
[1:13:32] God.
[1:13:34] Now God had already sent his angel
[1:13:38] and the angel was with and the angel was
[1:13:42] in the camp.
[1:13:45] Moving on and the revelation of God had
[1:13:48] brought the word of God manifested.
[1:13:54] And now they was ready to push into the
[1:13:56] promised land.
[1:13:59] Grace be unto you
[1:14:02] and peace from God our father
[1:14:06] from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:09] Praise the Lord. Blessed be the God and
[1:14:12] father
[1:14:15] Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:14:18] spiritual blessings.
[1:14:23] All spiritual blessings,
[1:14:27] every blessing that we have need of
[1:14:31] he has blessed us. So when you approach
[1:14:34] him for your blessing,
[1:14:36] you approach him upon the basis of this
[1:14:39] his covenant.
[1:14:42] He promised to give us all spiritual
[1:14:44] blessings
[1:14:48] in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:50] according as he has chosen us
[1:14:53] not by my desire
[1:14:55] not your desire
[1:14:57] not Paul's desire
[1:15:00] has chosen us in him
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world
[1:15:05] did you think of that
[1:15:08] did you think of that
[1:15:11] he chose us in him before the foundation
[1:15:14] of the world that we should be holy
[1:15:19] Not because I lived right,
[1:15:23] because he chose me to be that way.
[1:15:27] He done it, not I. That is the reason.
[1:15:33] You are holy this afternoon.
[1:15:36] Not because you deserve it.
[1:15:40] Not because you deserved it,
[1:15:42] but because he chose you to be that way.
[1:15:47] Why did he choose you to be that way?
[1:15:50] Before the foundation of the world
[1:15:55] and without blame before him in love.
[1:15:59] Now back there before the foundation of
[1:16:01] the world
[1:16:04] chose you in Christ
[1:16:08] to appear holy at the end time
[1:16:12] all the way from the foundation of the
[1:16:14] world.
[1:16:16] Do you believe that?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; In this message, he says,
[1:16:26] "Blessed be the God and father of Lord
[1:16:28] Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] quoting the same scripture in Hebrews
[1:16:36] and it says
[1:16:38] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:16:42] who is the us.
[1:16:46] There
[1:16:47] it is the church. He chose us in him
[1:16:52] before the foundation
[1:16:54] the earth that we should be holy without
[1:16:56] blame before him in love.
[1:17:00] Having predestinated us to the adoption
[1:17:02] of children
[1:17:06] to himself
[1:17:08] according to his own good pleasure of
[1:17:11] his will.
[1:17:13] Who did it? Who did the choosing? God
[1:17:18] did it.
[1:17:20] God know it from the beginning
[1:17:23] who would be saved and who would not be
[1:17:25] saved.
[1:17:27] God knew from the beginning
[1:17:31] would and would not.
[1:17:34] So therefore he knew that some would.
[1:17:39] So he sent Jesus to make a
[1:17:41] appropriation.
[1:17:45] For those that he forneew.
[1:17:47] For those who he forneew,
[1:17:51] he called. And those he has called, he
[1:17:55] has justified.
[1:17:57] And those who he has justified,
[1:18:00] he hath
[1:18:03] glorified.
[1:18:05] There you are.
[1:18:07] So it's not you that keeps yourself.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; It is the grace of God that keeps you.
[1:18:15] You did save yourself
[1:18:18] or nothing you done to deserve being
[1:18:20] saved.
[1:18:24] God is grace
[1:18:26] that saved you. God is grace that called
[1:18:30] you. God is for knowledge.
[1:18:34] He knew you. He knew that you would be
[1:18:37] in this church this night
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world was
[1:18:44] ever laid.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; So how can you say it is something you
[1:18:48] could do?
[1:18:52] There's nothing you can do about it. It
[1:18:55] is God's love.
[1:18:57] God is grace to you.
[1:19:00] But you are even here.
[1:19:03] Nothing you could do.
[1:19:05] called you by his grace.
[1:19:08] You listened,
[1:19:10] you heard. You accepted.
[1:19:13] That's why you are here.
[1:19:16] Praise the Lord. And now the best
[1:19:19] approach
[1:19:22] to God is faith and obedience
[1:19:26] to the word of God. After he has chosen
[1:19:29] us and called us, he takes us into the
[1:19:34] adoption as children by Jesus Christ.
[1:19:38] So we must trust him at all stages.
[1:19:43] We must obey him at all stages.
[1:19:47] We must have complete faith in the
[1:19:49] leadership of the word.
[1:19:55] there we have full access to all the
[1:19:57] treasures.
[1:20:01] If we have complete trust
[1:20:04] and faith in the leadership of the word
[1:20:08] and we obey to be led by the word
[1:20:12] through the adoption of children,
[1:20:15] we have full access to all the
[1:20:17] treasures.
[1:20:21] For we are the children in his
[1:20:23] household.
[1:20:26] Praise the Lord. And he says this thing
[1:20:30] commanded I them, saying,
[1:20:33] "Obey my voice,
[1:20:36] and I will be your God,
[1:20:39] and you shall be my people,
[1:20:42] and you walk in all the ways that I have
[1:20:44] commanded you,
[1:20:47] that it may be well unto you.
[1:20:52] If you walk in his ways,
[1:20:55] his word, it shall be well unto you.
[1:20:59] You shall be my people.
[1:21:02] I shall be a God.
[1:21:05] How do you approach God? Always approach
[1:21:08] God
[1:21:10] on the basis of his covenant,
[1:21:13] on the basis of his word. And it is he
[1:21:16] who has chosen you.
[1:21:19] So it is he that is to take care of.
[1:21:22] May the Lord bless you.
[1:21:39] Let us
[1:21:42] let us get on our feet.
[1:21:48] Let us get on our feet.
[1:21:53] We get on our feet and we worship and we
[1:21:57] pray. Then we leave.
[1:22:02] We were saved by grace. Let us sing that
[1:22:05] song.
[1:22:07] Grace, grace, grace,
[1:22:10] grace, grace, grace. Amen.
[1:22:17] Grace,
[1:22:19] grace
[1:22:21] go.
[1:22:23] Grace,
[1:22:25] grace that will pon and cleanse
[1:22:30] wein.
[1:22:33] Grace,
[1:22:34] grace.
[1:22:36] God's
[1:22:38] grace,
[1:22:40] grace that is greater than all
[1:22:46] our sin.
[1:22:49] Marvelous
[1:22:51] grace over loveing.
[1:22:57] Grace that exceeds
[1:23:00] our sin and our guilty
[1:23:05] y on calary
[1:23:08] mountain were born
[1:23:12] there where the blood of the lamb
[1:23:18] was.
[1:23:19] Oh grace,
[1:23:22] grace,
[1:23:25] God's
[1:23:27] grace,
[1:23:29] grace
[1:23:30] will battle and cleanse
[1:23:34] within.
[1:23:37] Grace,
[1:23:38] grace.
[1:23:41] God's
[1:23:43] grace.
[1:23:45] Grace that is greater than all
[1:23:50] our sin.
[1:23:53] Deny his spell like the sea
[1:23:58] waves go
[1:24:01] threaten the soul
[1:24:04] with the final blows.
[1:24:09] Grace that is greatest
[1:24:13] grace
[1:24:14] and all
[1:24:17] points to the reuge the mighty
[1:24:24] grace
[1:24:27] great
[1:24:29] God's
[1:24:31] grace
[1:24:33] grace that will pon and cla
[1:24:39] Grace,
[1:24:41] grace,
[1:24:43] grace.
[1:24:45] God's
[1:24:47] grace. Yes, grace that is gater than
[1:24:54] all.
[1:24:56] The dark may be put on you. Dark is the
[1:25:00] state that we are.

[1:28:36] in
[1:28:38] the Lord
[1:28:40] that Jesus
[1:28:43] saves me. Now
[1:28:46] have a time of talking to him.
[1:28:49] approach him on the basis of the
[1:28:52] covenant he has given you that finished
[1:28:55] work of Calvary the shed blood
[1:28:59] because the scripture says we were
[1:29:01] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:04] Lord Jesus we realize the finished work
[1:29:07] of Calvary we sing grace Lord because we
[1:29:11] are saved by grace we come here by grace
[1:29:14] Lord we are believers by grace Lord and
[1:29:17] we know Lord Jesus Paul says that we I
[1:29:20] cannot you know boost myself because
[1:29:24] when I count all what I am it is just
[1:29:27] done Lord God we cannot trace Lord where
[1:29:31] we came from we cannot see that this is
[1:29:34] what um I am Lord because I've put much
[1:29:38] effort maybe I've done something Lord
[1:29:41] but Lord Jesus we were called we were
[1:29:44] set aside and we Lord we receive your
[1:29:47] word we come We approach you basing on
[1:29:50] the word and we approach you Lord. We
[1:29:53] know that Jesus Christ was tore down on
[1:29:56] Calvary. Jesus Christ was pierced Lord
[1:30:00] in his limbs that we may come out Lord
[1:30:03] to manifest the life which was in
[1:30:05] Christ. That's why the prophet says when
[1:30:08] Jesus was bruised when he was pierced on
[1:30:11] his side on his limb we came out. The
[1:30:14] bride of Jesus was you know constructed
[1:30:18] Lord. Oh my Lord Jesus. That's why we
[1:30:21] come into the nature of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:23] That's why we know who we are. That's
[1:30:26] why we know who our father is. That's
[1:30:28] why we know before Lord Jesus because
[1:30:32] you said if you know if you are of the
[1:30:35] of your father Abraham you know who I am
[1:30:38] because Abraham longed of my day.
[1:30:41] Abraham wanted to see me in my day, Lord
[1:30:44] Jesus. These are your children, Lord,
[1:30:47] the seed of Abraham. Because if Abraham
[1:30:50] was now was to be here, he would believe
[1:30:53] this message, Lord. If Noah was to be
[1:30:56] here, he was to preach this gospel or he
[1:30:58] was to believe this word. If Jonah who
[1:31:01] fled to Talis was here, he would
[1:31:04] believe. But yet, Lord, when you
[1:31:07] approached the Pharisees, you told them
[1:31:09] that you are going to give them a sign
[1:31:11] of the prophet Jonah. Lord Jesus, this
[1:31:14] night we don't seek signs. We don't seek
[1:31:17] wonders, Lord, but we are seeking for
[1:31:19] the word. We are seeking for your face,
[1:31:21] Lord. We are seeking for your
[1:31:23] manifestation of the word. We know, Lord
[1:31:26] Jesus, David, if he was to be here, he
[1:31:29] was to be under this word. And Lord
[1:31:31] Jesus, that's why he said, I was glad
[1:31:34] when I was told to go into the house of
[1:31:36] our Lord. And our hearts are burning
[1:31:38] within us. Lord, thank you for the
[1:31:40] minister, Lord. Thank you for the
[1:31:42] preparations of the word he has done.
[1:31:45] Because Lord Jesus, he has given us the
[1:31:48] word of exaltation. He has given us the
[1:31:50] word of cleansing, the words of
[1:31:52] awakening, Lord, that we may not slam by
[1:31:55] this word. As Paul says, we should not
[1:31:58] neglect this word, oh God. Because if we
[1:32:01] neglect, how shall we escape, Lord? We
[1:32:04] know, Lord Jesus, we are complete in
[1:32:06] you. We are complete in word and we
[1:32:09] approach you by the word. We approach
[1:32:11] you by the Lord Jesus. And your
[1:32:13] ministers said that Lord, you put your
[1:32:16] name in us, Lord. And you dwell in us
[1:32:18] and you walk with us. You walk in us
[1:32:21] Lord that the world may see a testimony
[1:32:24] as we walk back home Lord. May we go
[1:32:26] back as a testimony. May we go back as a
[1:32:29] living you know oracle of God. It is
[1:32:32] written. Oh Lord Jesus it is written.
[1:32:35] Every time Lord when we walk every time
[1:32:37] we we reach the spot we say it is
[1:32:39] written. Oh my Jesus this day Lord is
[1:32:43] this scripture fulfilled that we are
[1:32:45] living epistles written and read of all
[1:32:48] men. Lord God, I pray. Father, may you
[1:32:51] guide us this evening as we go home. It
[1:32:54] is now dark. Lord, guide the drivers.
[1:32:57] Lord, guide our vehicles, our
[1:32:59] motorbikes, Lord, and our eyes may be
[1:33:01] enlightened by the goodness of God that
[1:33:04] we may reach home safely. Oh God, I
[1:33:06] commit your pastors, Lord. May you guide
[1:33:09] them wherever they are, Lord. And those
[1:33:11] people Lord who are away Lord Jesus who
[1:33:13] have not come Lord Jesus they wish to be
[1:33:15] here but yet they were caught up by work
[1:33:18] Lord maybe sicknesses maybe attacks Lord
[1:33:22] or by the enemy but we know Lord you
[1:33:25] give them grace because you have the
[1:33:27] covenant written and you will never
[1:33:30] despise them Lord. You will never cast
[1:33:32] them away because they have not come to
[1:33:34] church but you always lead them. You
[1:33:37] always keep them Lord. Therefore keep us
[1:33:39] Lord as we go home and bless us all
[1:33:41] together in the mighty name of our Lord
[1:33:44] Jesus Christ. Lord we pray. Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] We thank you Jesus.
[1:33:50] Thank you for reaching us far Lord.
[1:33:53] Thank you for bringing us all thus far.
[1:33:55] Oh God.
[1:33:57] That's why we sing about your grace
[1:33:59] Lord.
[1:34:01] That's why we sing about your love. Oh
[1:34:03] God. How rich and pure. How measurless.
[1:34:07] Glory.
