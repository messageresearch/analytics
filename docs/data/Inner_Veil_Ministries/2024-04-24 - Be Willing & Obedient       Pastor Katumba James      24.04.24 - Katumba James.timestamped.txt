[9:44] together Lord we love you and we thank
[9:46] you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[9:48] Christ we pray and ask this
[9:52] amen so let us turn to our Bibles
[10:01] and we go to the book of
[10:03] Isaiah chapter
[10:06] 1 Isaiah chapter
[10:08] 1 I'm reading from verse 16 up to verse
[10:13] 19 Isaiah chapter 1 verse 16 to verse
[10:18] 19 so the Bible
[10:20] says wash ye make you clean put away the
[10:25] evil of your doings from before my eyes
[10:28] see cease to do evil learn to do well
[10:33] seek judgment relieve the oppressed
[10:37] judge the fatherless plead for the
[10:40] Widow come now and let us rason together
[10:44] says the Lord though your sins be as
[10:47] Scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[10:52] though they be red like Crimson they
[10:55] shall be as wool if you be willing and
[10:58] obedient
[10:59] you shall eat the good of the land may
[11:02] God bless of his word you may be
[11:06] seated so I want to preach on the
[11:08] subject be willing and
[11:11] obedient that's in verse 19 be willing
[11:15] and obedient praise the name of our
[11:19] lord it's a very very important that we
[11:23] are willing in other words we
[11:26] agree we accept
[11:29] we yield praise the name of our Lord
[11:32] like you know when you hear the word of
[11:34] God have a willing
[11:37] heart accept that word praise the name
[11:41] of our Lord you know take it it's just
[11:43] like a woman who is going to be taken in
[11:46] marriage before the woman is married she
[11:50] has to accept praise the name of our
[11:53] Lord like Ela when he was sent to get a
[11:57] bride for Isaac
[11:59] and when he met Rebecca and he saw by
[12:03] Revelation that Rebecca was the wife
[12:06] that was meant to be taken for Isaac he
[12:09] asked where do you come from who are
[12:12] your parents and then he said is there
[12:15] room for us to come and spend the night
[12:17] there and even enough animal feets she
[12:20] said it's okay and then now they went
[12:23] home and then Ela started giving a
[12:26] testimony of how the Lord LED him to to
[12:30] find that it's Rebecca who is meant to
[12:33] be Isaac's wife and you know the Bible
[12:36] says that the family of Rebecca said if
[12:41] the woman would be willing you get it so
[12:46] there has to be an
[12:48] acceptance there has to be a consent you
[12:50] know you to accept it and this is the
[12:54] same thing with the Gospel of Jesus
[12:56] Christ is that when you hear the word of
[12:58] God you have to accept it have a willing
[13:01] heart and this is why the Bible says
[13:03] that if you be
[13:05] willing so like now they had to ask
[13:08] Rebecca are you willing to go with this
[13:10] man are you willing to get into the
[13:13] marriage and that's the same thing that
[13:15] comes when people are making marriage
[13:17] convenants you know they ask the man is
[13:20] there anything that you think can impede
[13:23] you from marrying this person he says no
[13:26] Then they ask the woman is there
[13:28] anything that can prevent you from
[13:29] marrying this man they says no so there
[13:32] has to be a willingness there has to be
[13:34] an acceptance and this is now how the
[13:38] Lord also wants us to be we must be
[13:40] willing we must have an acceptance you
[13:44] must consent you know you have to agree
[13:48] with the word of God praise the name of
[13:51] our Lord and then now when you consent
[13:53] he says and be
[13:56] obedient praise the name of our Lord
[13:58] like when Rebecca
[14:01] accepted you know she said it's okay
[14:04] then she had now to be obedient to the
[14:07] instructions of
[14:09] elazar she had to allow elza said this
[14:13] is the horse which is going to carry or
[14:15] the camel and then she had to follow
[14:17] that until now when she reached in the
[14:20] field and then she saw Isaac he said
[14:22] who's what is that who is that person he
[14:24] says that is my master then Rebecca
[14:27] covered herself and when she got into
[14:29] the marriage she had to go and work
[14:32] according to the marriage kind of way it
[14:35] works and that's the same thing with the
[14:38] Gospel of Jesus Christ we have heard the
[14:40] word of God we have accepted the word of
[14:43] God we have believed the word of God but
[14:46] that we need to be
[14:48] obedient praise the name of our Lord we
[14:51] need to be obedient to the word of God
[14:54] you know when the word of God tells us
[14:55] do this thing that's what God expects
[14:58] from us so you have a willing heart and
[15:01] then you are obedient and then the Bible
[15:04] says in Isaiah 1 19 it says if you be
[15:10] willing and obedient the Bible says you
[15:15] shall eat the good of the land praise
[15:18] the name of our Lord he says if we are
[15:20] willing and then we are obedient we
[15:23] shall eat the good of the land now in
[15:27] the message questions and answers he
[15:29] says the promise is the baptism of the
[15:33] spirit which is Promised through the Old
[15:36] Testament and the new two the promise
[15:40] behold I send the promise of my father
[15:43] upon you Peter said that on the day of
[15:46] Pentecost that is the
[15:48] promise the promised land is to live in
[15:52] this land of the Holy Spirit and so now
[15:56] also if we are going to live in the land
[15:58] of the Holy Spirit we need to be willing
[16:01] and obedient to the word of God praise
[16:05] the name of our Lord whever the Holy
[16:07] Ghost leads us praise the name of our
[16:10] Lord be willing and obedient if the will
[16:14] of God is this be willing and obedient
[16:17] and then the Bible says then you'll eat
[16:19] the good of the land in other words
[16:21] you'll take possession over that land
[16:24] you'll be able to enjoy the benefits
[16:26] that are in the land of the Holy Spirit
[16:29] then he says that is God's promise for
[16:31] the church is to live in the power of
[16:34] the spirit it's another world it's
[16:38] another land you have to come out of
[16:40] these conditions that you've been in to
[16:43] come out to live in the promised land to
[16:47] receive the promise remember the promise
[16:50] you shall receive power from on high
[16:53] after this the Holy Ghost is come upon
[16:55] you and Peter said that the promise that
[16:59] was made all down through the testament
[17:02] old and new you
[17:05] find promising on up on up to the day of
[17:10] Pentecost and then they entered into the
[17:13] promise praise the name of our Lord so
[17:16] he says the land we we are now talking
[17:19] about is the land of the Holy Spirit you
[17:22] know every Divine promise of God Is
[17:25] Right within the holy spirit so he says
[17:28] if if we can be willing and if we can be
[17:31] obedient to the word of God then we eat
[17:34] the good of the Holy Ghost we eat the
[17:37] good of the land praise the name of our
[17:39] Lord you eat the goodness of the Holy
[17:41] Spirit you get the peace in your heart
[17:44] you get the joy of the Lord in your
[17:46] heart you got you get the patience the
[17:49] longsuffering you are eating the good of
[17:51] the land and you see what we possess are
[17:54] Eternal things praise the name of our
[17:57] Lord and those Eternal things you can't
[17:59] buy them with
[18:00] money but you see you have to be willing
[18:03] and obedient for you to possess the good
[18:07] things of the land praise the name of
[18:09] our Lord what an assurance that we have
[18:12] that if we can like God has given us the
[18:15] privilege that we have heard the word of
[18:17] God so when we hear the word of God let
[18:21] us be having a willing mind a willing
[18:25] heart praise the name of our Lord and
[18:27] then you obey the word of God and that's
[18:30] how the word of God will bring its
[18:33] impact Upon Our Lives that's how we
[18:36] shall be changed and the Bible talks
[18:38] about being changed from glory to glory
[18:42] and every day we have to be growing
[18:44] praise the name of our Lord you can't
[18:46] say me I stopped growing in the spirit
[18:49] keep on growing keep on possessing more
[18:52] land keep on overcoming your weaknesses
[18:55] if my weaknesses today are something
[18:58] then tomorrow not be the same thing that
[19:00] means that I'm possessing there's
[19:02] something I'm gaining the way God told
[19:05] them that every in where your foot will
[19:08] take you'll possess it praise the name
[19:11] of our Lord so we just need to
[19:14] possess praise the name of our Lord all
[19:17] that the Lord has promised
[19:19] us now in Exodus chapter 23 and then
[19:23] verse 20
[19:29] Exodus 23 and then verse 20 the
[19:32] scripture
[19:35] says behold I send an angel before thee
[19:39] to keep thee in the
[19:41] way and to bring thee into the place
[19:45] which I have
[19:47] prepared that's what the Bible is
[19:49] telling us he sent an angel he send an
[19:54] angel before us to keep us in the way
[20:00] praise the name of our Lord he sent an
[20:03] angel to keep us in the way and to bring
[20:07] us into the place which he has prepared
[20:10] for us like last time I believe it was
[20:14] wedes day you know we were looking at
[20:17] the promise of our day what promise do
[20:20] we have of our day praise the name of
[20:23] our Lord and then we saw the promise is
[20:25] the change of our bodies the promise is
[20:28] that these mortal bodies must put on
[20:30] immortality so that's our possession
[20:34] that is our Target so now the Bible is
[20:36] telling us that God has sent an angel
[20:40] before us to keep us in the way that he
[20:43] may bring us praise the name of our Lord
[20:47] to the place that he has prepared for us
[20:50] so the angel is here to take us to
[20:53] adoption the angel is here to take us to
[20:55] the change of our bodies praise the name
[20:58] of Lord and so what we have to do is to
[21:00] be willing and obedient he has sent down
[21:04] the Holy Ghost so allow the spirit of
[21:07] God the Holy Ghost the inside teacher to
[21:11] do his leadership to do his guiding to
[21:14] tutor us praise the name of our Lord
[21:17] that we may be brought to the point of
[21:20] adoption to serve the purpose of God for
[21:23] our lives praise the name of our Lord so
[21:26] he says the angel knows the way he knows
[21:29] what we have to go through every other
[21:31] day and then God gives us the grace to
[21:34] overcome these things what we have to do
[21:36] is to be willing and
[21:39] obedient praise the name of our Lord
[21:42] then verse 21 it says be aware of him
[21:45] and obey his voice provoke him not for
[21:49] he will not pardon your transgress for
[21:51] my name is in him but if thou shall
[21:55] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[21:59] speak then I will be an enemy unto thy
[22:01] enemies and an adversary unto th
[22:04] adversaries for mine Angel shall go
[22:07] before thee and bring thee in unto the
[22:11] amorites and the Hittites and the
[22:14] parites and the Canaanites and the hites
[22:18] and the jebusites and I'll cut them off
[22:22] praise the name of our Lord so the Bible
[22:24] is telling us let us
[22:26] obey the voice of of the Angel and we
[22:30] know that we live we have been Liv we
[22:32] have been in the seven Church ages and
[22:35] here we are now in the lisian church age
[22:39] and when you look at the messages to the
[22:41] church ages in Revelations chapter 1 and
[22:43] chapter 2 and chapter 3 the message was
[22:46] coming to the angel praise the name of
[22:49] our Lord and so we have also had an
[22:51] angel in the Lordan Church age and that
[22:55] angel brought the message so now we need
[22:57] also to obey the voice of the Angel
[23:00] praise the name of our Lord we need to
[23:02] be obedient to the message that we have
[23:05] received come back with evidence and
[23:07] then he said without perfect love you
[23:10] cannot be there praise the name of our
[23:12] Lord so now we have got the message of
[23:15] the hour to bring us into the full
[23:17] possession of what God has prepared for
[23:20] us praise the name of our Lord like John
[23:23] chapter 14 Jesus said I go and prepare a
[23:27] place for you that's what the scripture
[23:29] says so now and then brother Brandon
[23:32] preaches about this in message things
[23:35] that are to be and then your brother
[23:37] Bram was so much privileged to get into
[23:40] that land into that place that the Lord
[23:43] has prepared for them that love him
[23:45] praise the name of our Lord and so we
[23:47] have such a great promise that God has
[23:51] given us a message God has sent us a
[23:54] message has given us an assurance a
[23:57] proof that this message praise the name
[24:00] of our Lord will lead us to the change
[24:02] of our bodies so then we need to be
[24:05] willing and obedient to the message that
[24:08] God has given unto us praise the name of
[24:11] our Lord then in 19 I believe it was
[24:15] 1964 either 1964 65 I'm
[24:18] forgetting brother brandham had you know
[24:21] that Vision about the preview of the
[24:24] bride all these were things that God was
[24:27] assuring our age that this is what is
[24:30] before you praise the name of our Lord
[24:33] this is what is before us so we need to
[24:36] see that we run the race with
[24:39] patience praise the name of our Lord we
[24:42] run the race with patience like Paul say
[24:46] praise the name of our Lord that you
[24:48] know I strive to the mark of the High
[24:51] Calling of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
[24:54] mark of our high calling now is the
[24:57] change of our bodies
[24:59] that's the climax we have to look to
[25:02] every day that you live are you living a
[25:04] life and obedient to the message
[25:06] obedient to the leadership of the Holy
[25:08] Ghost that your body has to be changed
[25:12] from this moral body to immortality
[25:15] praise the name of our Lord you know
[25:16] these are the promises that the Lord has
[25:18] given us great and precious promises
[25:22] praise the name of our Lord so now in
[25:24] the message the angel of the Lord he
[25:25] says God went down there and told mes
[25:29] said to yourself go down there and tell
[25:33] the people then he says I hard in far's
[25:37] heart CU he won't
[25:39] believe and do could you
[25:43] imagine that how a man that rejects
[25:46] light when God sent down there with
[25:49] Moses it was not Moses it was God and
[25:54] God said I'll send an angel before you
[25:57] to keep you in the way and to bring you
[25:59] to the place that I have prepared is
[26:02] that right and when the children of
[26:04] Israel seen this Angel he was a pillar
[26:08] of
[26:10] fire praise the name of the Lord I'm
[26:13] just oldfashioned enough to believe that
[26:15] God is the same yesterday today and
[26:18] forever the same God with the same power
[26:22] now when he appeared back there first he
[26:25] was a Roy wind in a bush to me when he
[26:28] appeared and I come as Moses of all to
[26:32] tell you not to follow me but follow
[26:36] Christ believe him that is here here to
[26:40] heal all the sick the needy do you
[26:43] believe it and I believe is there to
[26:45] heal those who have need of him save
[26:48] those put those in highness of God do
[26:51] you believe that send them out to be
[26:54] Soul winners and to preach the gospel
[26:57] how marvelous he is praise the name of
[26:59] our Lord so brother Bram also giving a
[27:01] testimony that the angel of the Lord is
[27:04] here to lead to guide praise the name of
[27:07] our Lord to bring
[27:09] Deliverance praise the name of our Lord
[27:11] and so we see that we have also the same
[27:15] privilege like those people had before
[27:18] we also have the same privilege now much
[27:21] as brother Bram is of the scene but we
[27:23] still have the message of the Lord and
[27:25] not only the message but the angel of
[27:28] the Lord is right here with us also
[27:31] praise the name of our Lord and not only
[27:32] the angel of the Lord but the Holy
[27:34] Spirit
[27:36] himself praise the name of our Lord the
[27:38] Holy Spirit himself in our lives you
[27:42] know he guides us he leads us praise the
[27:45] name of our Lord and then we get to know
[27:47] the mind of God concerning our lives
[27:50] praise the name of our Lord so we need
[27:52] to be willing and obedient to follow all
[27:56] the word that God has given unto us
[27:59] and then you don't do something you know
[28:01] you don't take something partial or you
[28:04] select this and say this one I'm not
[28:06] taking it we need to take the whole
[28:08] counsel of God we need to take the whole
[28:11] word of God because it is all God praise
[28:15] the name of our
[28:17] Lord let us go to Deuteronomy chap 12
[28:20] and verse 28
[28:34] so the Bible
[28:35] says observe and hear all these words
[28:39] which I command thee that it may go well
[28:42] with you and with your children after
[28:45] thee forever when thou does that which
[28:48] is good and right in the sight of the
[28:52] Lord thy God praise the name of our Lord
[28:55] seeking to do that which is good and
[28:58] right every day in every decision that
[29:01] we make in our thoughts in our
[29:05] imaginations everywhere you are maybe at
[29:08] home or at place of work or at school or
[29:11] you are traveling among strangers always
[29:14] seek to do that which is right and
[29:18] acceptable before God praise the name of
[29:20] our Lord and then there you know that
[29:22] you'll be pleasing to God so you'll be
[29:25] able to take possession of the land
[29:27] you'll be take possession of the
[29:29] promises of God that he has given us in
[29:31] this day praise the name of our Lord he
[29:34] says do
[29:36] good and write what is acceptable before
[29:40] the eyes of God all the time praise the
[29:44] name of our Lord then in Deuteronomy
[29:47] chapter 15 and verse
[29:55] 5 he says only if
[29:59] th carefully hearken unto the voice of
[30:03] the Lord thy God to
[30:06] observe to do all these Commandments
[30:10] which I command thee this day for the
[30:13] Lord thy God blesses thee as he promised
[30:16] thee and thou shall lend unto many
[30:20] nations but thou shall not borrow and
[30:23] thou shalt Reign Over many nations but
[30:26] thou shall not Reign but they shall not
[30:29] Reign Over You Now these are
[30:33] promises these are blessings these are
[30:37] ways teaching us how do we Acclaim those
[30:40] promises how do we reach those promises
[30:43] he says hearken to the voice of the Lord
[30:48] be willing be obedient and when you are
[30:51] obedient then you take possession of the
[30:55] promises of God you take possession of
[30:57] the land of what the Lord has promised
[31:00] us praise the name of our Lord you
[31:03] possess it so you have to be allowing
[31:06] the spirit of God to lead us praise the
[31:10] name of our Lord now in the message the
[31:13] angel of the Lord is
[31:16] says now notice in the old days when God
[31:22] told Moses now you go and I'll send an
[31:26] angel before you to keep you in the way
[31:28] and to bring you into the place which I
[31:31] have prepared be aware of him only obey
[31:36] his voice for he will not pardon your
[31:39] transgressions for my name is in him
[31:43] that angel was the angel of the Covenant
[31:46] which was Christ Jesus the people many
[31:49] of them did not believe it those who did
[31:52] not believe perished those who did
[31:55] believe went on into the Promised Land
[31:58] and the men who reject light went into
[32:01] total darkness and I believe today those
[32:04] who reject the Holy Spirit In The Light
[32:07] Of God the days of Miracles and for so
[32:10] forth go back into total
[32:14] darkness did you see how the Pharisees
[32:17] heart how dark it got he did not have
[32:21] nothing to do no more with the
[32:23] Israelites he showed them no favor
[32:27] because he Harden his heart against the
[32:30] light and Men Who Harden their heart
[32:32] against the light walk in darkness now
[32:36] that's where the danger is because he
[32:38] says today if you hear his voice Harden
[32:42] not your heart as in the day of
[32:44] provocation then Pharaoh heard the voice
[32:48] and he kept on hardening his heart so
[32:51] the prophet says he went into the
[32:53] darkness he perished and so here we've
[32:57] heard the voice voice the message of the
[32:59] hour praise the name of our Lord so we
[33:02] need to be obedient to the voice that
[33:06] we've heard and then when we are
[33:08] obedient the voice that we had then the
[33:11] voice will make us we shall be able to
[33:14] see the good of the land to test the
[33:16] good of the land praise the name of our
[33:18] Lord we shall be in position to take
[33:21] possession over all the things that God
[33:24] has promised us in this day then he says
[33:28] brother sister in the name of our Lord
[33:31] please get me right now what I'm trying
[33:33] to say to you that God who came out in
[33:36] the old days and led the Church of God
[33:39] out of Egypt the bondage in Freedom has
[33:43] come down again in the same manner to
[33:47] lead his church spiritual out of bondage
[33:50] of sin by the Holy Spirit sickness next
[33:55] and the third step is to go into grow
[33:58] take this motor and make it morality the
[34:02] Transfiguration of the human bodies to
[34:05] transform them into the perfect image of
[34:07] the Son of God please believe with all
[34:11] your heart praise the name of our Lord
[34:14] you know so what this what the Lord is
[34:16] doing he wants to take us into Glory he
[34:19] wants to change us you know whereby our
[34:23] mortal bodies shall put on immortality
[34:26] praise the name of our Lord so we have
[34:28] to be willing and
[34:30] obedient the message that we've received
[34:33] let us be willing and obedient the word
[34:35] that is given to us let us be willing
[34:38] and obedient then we shall be able to
[34:40] take possession of the land we shall be
[34:42] able to see the goodness of the Lord
[34:45] even when we are still alive here praise
[34:48] the name of our Lord all the things that
[34:50] the Lord has promised you know the fruit
[34:52] of the spirit coming down freely in our
[34:55] lives because the Bible says the fruit
[34:58] of the spirit is love joy peace so that
[35:03] Spirit Bears his fruit in us so it's
[35:07] until you are willing and obedient to
[35:10] the Holy Spirit that's when you can
[35:12] manifest the holy spirit in your life by
[35:15] manifesting the fruit of the spirit
[35:17] bearing all the fruit of the spirit
[35:19] regardless of the circumstances that you
[35:21] go through praise the name of our Lord
[35:25] so we just need to see that we are
[35:29] obedient we dedicate ourselves unto the
[35:32] Lord praise the name of our Lord that we
[35:35] can take we can be able to take full
[35:38] possession of what God has promised us
[35:42] now in the
[35:43] message the faith of Abraham he
[35:47] says now his promises is under
[35:51] condition if thou can't
[35:55] believe he says all the promises of God
[35:59] the condition is is if you can
[36:03] believe he says do you have faith do you
[36:07] believe praise the name of our Lord he
[36:09] says when God sent Israel from Egypt 400
[36:14] years before he gave the promise to
[36:16] Moses beg your pardon or to Abraham here
[36:20] that his seed would SJ but would come
[36:23] again into the land bringing great
[36:26] possessions and when they started on
[36:29] their Journey he said behold I send an
[36:31] angel before you the pillar of fire to
[36:34] keep you in the way to bring you to the
[36:37] place which I have provided for you he
[36:40] said the whole thing is
[36:43] yours and when they got there they saw
[36:46] it all fenced up tightly with the
[36:49] amorites the parasites the hites the
[36:52] Juanes the jebusites all different kinds
[36:56] great High wall City all first in but he
[37:01] said it is yours now God don't go over
[37:07] there and say here all the jebusites and
[37:10] all you get out of here I'm bringing
[37:13] isra in no you got something to do
[37:17] yourself it's yours now go possess it oh
[37:22] I like it it belongs to you I'll give it
[37:25] to you do you believe it so he didn't
[37:28] the prophet is telling us he didn't go
[37:30] and remove the jebusites the
[37:33] Canaanites but he told them go so they
[37:36] had to have faith praise the name of our
[37:39] Lord and when Joshua and the 11 spies
[37:41] reached the land of Canaan they said
[37:44] that they are giants then the other 10
[37:47] spy says we are like
[37:50] grasshoppers but then Joshua and calb
[37:53] said we are more than able to possess
[37:56] the land praise the name of our Lord and
[37:59] we should have the same faith that maybe
[38:02] the devil has been afflicting you for
[38:04] such a long time but then you need to
[38:06] have the confidence that you're more
[38:08] than able to overcome that situation in
[38:10] your life praise the name of our Lord
[38:12] you just take that courage we are more
[38:15] than able praise the name of our Lord
[38:18] look for example when they reached
[38:20] Jericho Jericho was a world city
[38:24] wellfed but what did God tell them God
[38:27] told Joshua go
[38:29] and walk around the city for seven days
[38:34] the first day they walked around Jericho
[38:37] the second day they walked around
[38:39] Jericho until the seventh day and on the
[38:42] seventh day says walk around it seven
[38:45] times that was God's instructions walk
[38:49] around the city seven times and then
[38:51] when you have walked around it and
[38:53] you've surrounded it then start shouting
[38:56] that was the
[38:58] instruction praise the name of the Lord
[39:00] and when they started shouting the city
[39:02] started
[39:03] collapsing praise the name of our Lord
[39:05] so it's also the same thing also for us
[39:09] be willing and obedient and then the
[39:12] Lord himself knows what he's going to do
[39:15] praise the name of our Lord the pillar
[39:17] of fire LED them right to the Red
[39:21] Sea there was no big big fairy there or
[39:25] Bridge there it was not there but the
[39:27] Lord knew what he was doing until when
[39:29] they got there and cried to go to help
[39:32] them that's when the waters divided
[39:35] praise the name of our Lord so God is
[39:38] also still the same God that in the
[39:41] midst of the challenges or the hardships
[39:44] that may come our way he has always got
[39:46] a way to overcome those things praise
[39:49] the name of our Lord so just only be
[39:52] willing and obedient to follow the voice
[39:55] of the Lord praise the name of Lord so
[39:58] it doesn't matter what the obstacle is
[40:01] praise the name of our Lord it doesn't
[40:03] matter what the circumstance before you
[40:05] is the promise of God has to come to
[40:09] pass praise the name of our Lord the
[40:12] promise has to come to pass the mission
[40:15] has the mission has to be fulfilled
[40:18] praise the name of our Lord like Jonah
[40:20] he was sent to nevi then he was running
[40:23] away but God made everything work out
[40:26] until the Sheep the fish didn't take
[40:29] Jonah to tashes where they where it got
[40:32] him from but took him to Nev where the
[40:35] city God wanted him to preach praise the
[40:37] name of our Lord so God made the
[40:39] circumstance work out for the glory of
[40:42] His holy name so we shouldn't be
[40:45] deterred we shouldn't be hindered by the
[40:47] obstacles that we go through every other
[40:49] day we should not do that let us just
[40:52] believe God trust in God to give us
[40:55] victory in everything that we are going
[40:57] through praise the name of our Lord then
[41:00] he
[41:07] says that's the reason 10 spies is God
[41:10] said you could the other one said you
[41:13] can't that's the reason 10 spies when
[41:15] they come back say we can't take it why
[41:19] are we look like grasshoppers up beside
[41:22] them people but old Joshua and calb said
[41:25] we can't do it why God said so praise
[41:29] the name of our Lord that should be the
[41:31] same confession we have when God has
[41:33] said anything just say the same thing
[41:36] praise the name of our Lord and then the
[41:38] Bible says the spirit and the bride say
[41:41] come we need to have the same voice with
[41:43] the Holy Spirit we need to have the same
[41:46] voice with the angel of the Lord and
[41:48] then that's how we shall be able to take
[41:50] full possession then he
[41:52] says these other weaklings was looking
[41:55] through the physical side oh it is great
[41:59] we could never do that we could never
[42:01] teach Divine Healing and get by with
[42:05] it we could never have old time
[42:08] Pentecostal Revival they could count as
[42:11] fanatics but thank God Somebody went
[42:14] over and got the evidence and come back
[42:17] it is a good land praise the name of our
[42:21] Lord and that stimulates our desires you
[42:23] know like that Vision or that experience
[42:27] beyond the curtain of time you know the
[42:30] preview of the Bride it gives you such
[42:33] encouragement praise the name of our
[42:35] Lord that is something that God has put
[42:37] before us whereby we have to strive to
[42:41] reach that Mark praise the name of our
[42:44] Lord and then he
[42:47] says but thank God Somebody went over
[42:50] and got the evidence and come back it's
[42:52] a good land amen went over there and
[42:55] come back why they wasn't looking to the
[42:58] physical side of it they were looking to
[43:01] what God had promised I don't care how
[43:04] high defense is what the doctor said
[43:07] he's done the best he could what mother
[43:10] said what the pastor said the days of
[43:13] Miracles passed that don't have nothing
[43:15] to do with it look to to what God Said
[43:20] God made the promise we take it amen I
[43:24] like that courage courage to stand on
[43:27] what God said now listen this may hurt a
[43:32] little bit rra for the feathers up the
[43:34] wrong way you know but real children of
[43:37] Abraham Seed of Abraham believe that CU
[43:43] you are dead in Christ take on Abraham's
[43:46] seed and are hairs according to the
[43:50] promise the same Holy Spirit was in
[43:53] Christ is in you and you believe the
[43:56] same thing
[43:58] so if you do not believe remember
[44:01] there's something lacking cuz the holy
[44:03] spirit will certainly agree with his own
[44:07] word praise the name of our Lord so we
[44:10] need to see that we believe the Lord we
[44:14] take the word the way it is praise the
[44:16] name of our Lord believe God let it be
[44:20] at as he has said take him at his word
[44:24] praise the name of our Lord be willing
[44:26] and
[44:27] obedient then you will test the good of
[44:30] the land praise the name of our Lord so
[44:33] now let us go
[44:36] to 1 John
[44:47] 5:3 the Bible says for this is the love
[44:51] of God that we keep his
[44:55] Commandments and he his Commandments are
[44:59] not
[45:00] Grievous they are not
[45:02] burdensome they are not
[45:05] heavy they are not to afflict us that's
[45:08] the scripture his commandment his light
[45:11] says my yoke is easy praise the name of
[45:14] our Lord so be willing and obedient to
[45:17] it obey the voice of God obey the word
[45:21] of God and that's how you know you'll
[45:24] find yourself revived
[45:27] that's how you'll find yourself walking
[45:29] in the will of God praise the name of
[45:33] our Lord that's what the Lord has
[45:35] prepared for
[45:36] us is when he gives us his word he wants
[45:40] us to
[45:42] be following what the word says He says
[45:47] in the message the seven Church ages it
[45:50] is God's word that brings life and it's
[45:53] not what we say about the word that
[45:56] counts but it is what God
[45:59] Said So the word brings life so Allah
[46:04] love love that word accept that word
[46:08] follow that word obey that word and then
[46:11] it will bring what it has promised in
[46:13] our lives praise the name of our Lord
[46:16] and then you'll see that you are taking
[46:18] over places where you are weak places
[46:21] where have been failing but you have
[46:23] allowed the Lord to take charge over
[46:26] your life praise the name of our Lord so
[46:28] then you able to get the possession of
[46:30] the promises of the Lord praise the name
[46:33] of our Lord and then in another place
[46:35] brother Bram
[46:37] says that God's displeasure is for
[46:41] people to leave the
[46:43] word like you know that's what he said
[46:47] in all other ages people were living the
[46:51] word and the only way they he could tell
[46:54] them is get back
[46:57] to the
[46:58] word that's the way whenever they leave
[47:02] the word he says get back to the word in
[47:05] all ages you know the trouble was the
[47:10] same so he was telling them get back to
[47:14] the word so he says
[47:18] repent get back to from where you have
[47:20] fallen get back there praise the name of
[47:23] our Lord and that's the same thing is we
[47:26] need when we hear the word of God let us
[47:29] be willing have a willing mind accepting
[47:32] it in your heart and when you accept it
[47:34] in your heart be obedient to that word
[47:38] make sure that that word praise the name
[47:40] of our Lord is precious before you you
[47:43] cherish that word and then it will bring
[47:46] the promises that it has promised it
[47:49] will bring life praise the name of our
[47:51] Lord the Bible has told us his word is
[47:54] not Grievous
[47:57] praise the name of our lord it's not
[47:59] Grievous it's not heavy it is something
[48:03] that you can follow all the way praise
[48:06] the name of our Lord after everything
[48:08] that we see was made by the word of God
[48:11] then how can we deny the word of God how
[48:14] can we put the word of God aside and see
[48:16] that we can be alive but here if we can
[48:19] obey the word of God then we can be
[48:23] alive we can be quickened by the same
[48:26] living word of God praise the name of
[48:29] our Lord let us go to coron 1 coronal
[48:32] chapter
[48:36] 28 1 chonicles 28 and then
[48:40] verse verse
[48:52] 9 the Bible says and though Solomon my
[48:56] son
[48:57] know th the Lord of thy father and serve
[49:01] him with a perfect heart and with a
[49:05] willing mind praise the name of our Lord
[49:09] he says serve him with a perfect heart
[49:12] that means a whole heart you know not
[49:16] half heart but the whole
[49:20] heart with a willing mind for the Lord
[49:24] searches all hearts and and understands
[49:27] all imaginations of the thoughts if thou
[49:31] seek Him He will be found of thee if
[49:35] thou forsake Him He will cast thee off
[49:39] forever praise the name of our Lord so
[49:42] we need to be willing and obedient when
[49:45] you hear the word of God be obedient to
[49:48] that word and that's how you'll overcome
[49:50] your weaknesses when you are obedient
[49:53] and that's what we've been called to do
[49:55] every promise of God he wants us to be
[49:59] believing it and obedient to it you take
[50:03] it as your own this is what the Lord
[50:04] wants me to do so you possess it you own
[50:08] it praise the name of our Lord and so
[50:11] David was telling
[50:13] Solomon serve god with your whole heart
[50:18] the other place he told us do that which
[50:20] is right and good before God what is
[50:24] acceptable before God praise the name
[50:26] name of our Lord in other words you have
[50:28] the ability to make discernment to make
[50:31] a judgment over the issue you're going
[50:33] through and see how you can seek what is
[50:36] right and pleasing before God and then
[50:38] when you are doing that with a willing
[50:41] heart with a perfect heart and a willing
[50:44] mind then you'll be able to perform all
[50:48] that the Lord has promised praise the
[50:50] name of our Lord we shall be able to
[50:52] take possession of all the things that
[50:55] God has promised us in our generation
[50:58] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[51:00] message as I
[51:02] finish in the seven Church age
[51:05] book he says he has made us whole there
[51:10] are certain truth we need to emphasiz
[51:13] this is one of them he has made
[51:17] us salvation is his doing salvation is
[51:22] of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us
[51:27] for a purpose he bought us for a purpose
[51:31] we are Kings spiritual
[51:35] Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon
[51:38] the Earth with him when he sits on his
[51:40] throne but now we are spiritual Kings
[51:44] and we Reign Over a spiritual
[51:47] Kingdom it says in Romans
[51:50] 5:17 for If by one's man's offense death
[51:54] reigned by one much more they which
[51:57] receive abundance of Grace and of the
[51:59] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[52:02] life by one Jesus Christ and Colossians
[52:07] 1:13 who has delivered us from the power
[52:10] of darkness and has translated us into
[52:13] the kingdom reign of his dear son then
[52:17] he says right now we reign with
[52:22] Christ having dominion over sin the one
[52:27] the Flesh and the devil showing forth
[52:31] his praise and glory showing forth
[52:33] himself for it is Christ in US willing
[52:38] and doing of his good pleasure yes
[52:41] indeed even now we are seated in
[52:44] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise
[52:47] the name of our Lord so he has made us
[52:51] himself we just be willing and obedient
[52:55] and allow God to bring that
[52:57] transformation in your life he has made
[53:00] us Kings and brother says right now we
[53:02] are spiritual Kings we Reign Over The
[53:05] Devil we Reign Over The Flesh we Reign
[53:08] Over The World We Reign Over sin all
[53:11] those things that are contrary to God we
[53:13] Reign Over them so he has given us the
[53:16] ability praise the name of our Lord to
[53:19] take possession over these things
[53:22] blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus
[53:24] Christ so God has called us to a higher
[53:27] level praise the name of our Lord but
[53:30] you see when we are still living in this
[53:32] flesh we always we most of our time most
[53:35] of our thoughts are taken over by the
[53:38] things of this life but yet the things
[53:41] of this life it is a low level of Life
[53:45] very low level of Life very low the
[53:48] leadership the systems everything it's a
[53:51] very low level of Life praise the name
[53:54] of our Lord but he has called us to a
[53:56] higher Lev
[53:57] level praise the name of our Lord so he
[53:59] says we Reign Over the world but you see
[54:02] how the world wants to come and deceive
[54:03] us take your mind in this take your mind
[54:06] this yet we are meant to live Above This
[54:09] World We Are Meant To Live Above This
[54:11] flesh this flesh will always suggest to
[54:15] you different things come and do this go
[54:17] and do this go and do this like today
[54:19] being Wes day the flesh was saying you
[54:22] need to make more money you know like if
[54:24] you have a shop most come in the evening
[54:27] time to buy things so you say ah the
[54:29] whole morning have not sold I need to
[54:31] make some more money so the flesh is
[54:33] making you sit there or avoid coming to
[54:36] Fellowship but then we are meant to re
[54:39] over this flesh we are meant to re over
[54:42] the world the systems of the world to
[54:44] live above them we are meant to Reign
[54:47] Over The Devil praise the name of our
[54:50] Lord and Reign Over sin but if we are
[54:54] willing and obedient to the the word of
[54:57] God we shall overcome all these kind of
[55:00] things praise the name of our Lord
[55:02] that's how we overcome is be willing and
[55:06] obedient God has given us a message of
[55:08] the day when we read the message when we
[55:11] hear the message let us be willing and
[55:14] obedient praise the name of our Lord and
[55:17] all the promises that God has promised
[55:19] we shall have them POS in our possession
[55:22] we shall be changed praise the name of
[55:25] our Lord we shall be
[55:26] transformed praise the name of our Lord
[55:29] the Bible says greater is he that is in
[55:32] us than the devil that in the world
[55:35] praise the name of our Lord but yet you
[55:37] have to be willing and obedient to that
[55:40] who is in you praise the name of our
[55:42] Lord the Holy Spirit be obedient to the
[55:45] voice of the Holy Ghost be willing to
[55:49] obey the leadership of God in your life
[55:52] the leadership of God has given before
[55:54] us let us be willing and obedient praise
[55:57] the name of our Lord and then we shall
[55:59] be able to take all the possessions that
[56:02] the Lord has promised us in this day
