[1:01:47] the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:50] bodily and now the
[1:01:53] fullness but Jesus had no time
[1:01:57] to express it
[1:02:00] all he had no
[1:02:03] time that's why brother bam said he left
[1:02:07] certain
[1:02:09] things special for
[1:02:12] us in the final
[1:02:15] stage to unveil
[1:02:19] things of God that was hidden from

[1:02:40] praise our God is good amen
[1:02:44] amen amen
[1:02:47] hallelujah it's not about the minister
[1:02:50] te it's just all about him what I
[1:02:53] wouldn't preach I would not stand here
[1:02:57] if this message would not have
[1:03:02] come amen I preach because the message
[1:03:05] came my
[1:03:08] way so all about Jesus Christ it all all
[1:03:13] about the message of the
[1:03:15] hour not about a
[1:03:18] person not about the
[1:03:21] doctrine it's all about Jesus
[1:03:24] Christ amen to him be the honor and the
[1:03:28] glory amen God bless you as we
[1:03:30] stand let us turn to the to the
[1:03:35] Bible and we want to go to want to read
[1:03:37] from the book of
[1:03:42] Galatians
[1:03:44] Galatians something that was really
[1:03:47] impressed on my heart to go on
[1:03:51] this on this line
[1:03:54] again amen because because it's it's a
[1:03:57] further
[1:03:59] unfolding as we said over the years you
[1:04:04] see we known one another now for quite
[1:04:07] some
[1:04:09] years and it's it's it's actually very
[1:04:12] good because you see you will
[1:04:15] see that the minister here in the
[1:04:18] front has a growing
[1:04:22] Revelation I tell the people at home
[1:04:26] what I preached 20 years
[1:04:29] ago don't compare it to what I preach
[1:04:35] now because it's a growing
[1:04:39] Revelation amen I heard a minister once
[1:04:44] say I never changed what I preached in
[1:04:46] 30
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:52] years and I
[1:04:54] thought I changed
[1:05:02] much I F sorry for the
[1:05:08] brother because it shows there's no
[1:05:10] growing
[1:05:13] Revelation amen amen so we should not be
[1:05:18] ashamed that we are in a learning
[1:05:21] process that we are living in a growing
[1:05:24] revelation
[1:05:26] so because it's not about the
[1:05:29] minister It's All About
[1:05:32] Him amen we have our time
[1:05:35] here we come and we
[1:05:38] go Minister comes and Minister
[1:05:41] goes but this word is
[1:05:45] eternal this word will
[1:05:48] stand so I just want to speak this
[1:05:51] morning on the subject and I want to
[1:05:55] maybe put it in two
[1:05:58] parts this morning we want to start with
[1:06:00] it and this afternoon maybe we want to
[1:06:02] try to finish it
[1:06:05] up I want to speak on the
[1:06:10] impact of a restored
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:18] relationship on our
[1:06:22] inheritance amen the impact
[1:06:27] of restored
[1:06:32] relationship on our
[1:06:36] inheritance and our inheritance is the
[1:06:38] promised
[1:06:41] land amen amen amen our
[1:06:45] inheritance is the promised
[1:06:48] land amen all the promised land
[1:06:53] is is our in
[1:06:58] amen Galatians
[1:07:01] 4 we want to read from the verses 3 to
[1:07:08] 7 oh let's read from from verse
[1:07:12] one now I say that that the heir as long
[1:07:17] as he is a child differs nothing from a
[1:07:20] servant though he be Lord of all now
[1:07:35] but is under tutors and governors until
[1:07:37] the time appointed of the
[1:07:49] father so it's not the time appointed of
[1:07:52] the
[1:07:53] Sun but the time is appointed of the
[1:08:00] father so it is not you declaring you
[1:08:05] ready it is the
[1:08:08] father declaring they are
[1:08:11] ready it's a time appointed of the
[1:08:16] father hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[1:08:19] wonderful because God
[1:08:21] knows we have our ups and downs
[1:08:26] but God has no ups and
[1:08:30] downs Hallelujah his love is not
[1:08:36] wavering his mind about you is not
[1:08:41] changing hallelujah hallelujah so so if
[1:08:44] the son would make the time
[1:08:47] appointed maybe he would never think
[1:08:49] he's
[1:08:52] ready that's why the father has to
[1:08:54] appoint the time
[1:08:57] even so when we were children we were in
[1:08:59] bondage under the elements of the
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:10] world but when the fullness of the time
[1:09:13] was come God sent forth his son made of
[1:09:16] a woman made under the law
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:32] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:09:34] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:42] sons and because ye are Sons God has
[1:09:46] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:09:48] your hearts crying father
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:10:00] amen amen so if you have received the
[1:10:03] Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost it shows
[1:10:06] plainly you are a
[1:10:11] son amen it shows
[1:10:14] plainly you are a son you didn't became
[1:10:18] a
[1:10:19] son but because you are
[1:10:21] Sons God sent the Holy
[1:10:24] Spirit wherefore thou are no more a
[1:10:27] servant but a son and if a son then an
[1:10:31] heir of God through
[1:10:42] Christ amen I just like that an heir of
[1:10:47] God through
[1:10:50] Christ amen let's say that together
[1:10:55] air of
[1:10:57] God I am an heir of
[1:11:02] God that's why he
[1:11:05] died that's why Jesus Christ died amen
[1:11:09] God bless you let's turn to Genesis 1
[1:11:13] scripture Genesis
[1:11:16] 5 amen Genesis
[1:11:22] 5 we want to read only one verse
[1:11:30] 4 this might be our winding up this
[1:11:35] evening amen beautiful
[1:11:38] scripture and Enoch walked with
[1:11:42] God and he was
[1:11:48] not for God took
[1:11:53] him why he was not
[1:11:57] because God took
[1:12:00] him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:03] hallelujah why there will be a
[1:12:07] Rapture because God will take
[1:12:12] you Hallelujah let us pray Heavenly
[1:12:16] Father such a great
[1:12:19] privilege what we have come
[1:12:23] to Father it's a such a
[1:12:26] joy that you allowed us to live in this
[1:12:30] hour at the
[1:12:33] end you
[1:12:35] promised you will the mystery of God
[1:12:38] will be
[1:12:40] finished and we see
[1:12:42] today Christ was the mystery of
[1:12:45] God that mystery of
[1:12:48] God is
[1:12:50] finished is
[1:12:52] complete is unveiled
[1:12:56] speak to us this morning
[1:12:58] I father that has such an
[1:13:02] impact on each and
[1:13:04] everyone May that had have an impact on
[1:13:07] the sick
[1:13:08] people impact on bound
[1:13:11] people impact on struggling
[1:13:14] people such an impact
[1:13:18] father that it may heal them
[1:13:22] all set them free all
[1:13:26] deliver them
[1:13:27] all because you have sent forth your
[1:13:31] words and you have healed them we pray
[1:13:35] father we commit ourselves into your
[1:13:39] hands may this service be to your honor
[1:13:41] and to your
[1:13:43] glory ask it in Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] name amen amen amen God bless you may be
[1:13:51] seated hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:13:55] now Hallelujah we want to speak on on uh
[1:13:59] on the impact of restored
[1:14:08] relationship and and we understand that
[1:14:12] in that as we speak of
[1:14:16] relationship and as we speak of
[1:14:20] inheritance we want also to understand
[1:14:22] that our inheritance
[1:14:26] is completely
[1:14:28] based on what kind of relationship you
[1:14:32] [Music]
[1:14:34] have that's that's the way your
[1:14:36] inheritance will
[1:14:38] be amen take a take a normal
[1:14:41] family they have family you have uncles
[1:14:45] you have whatever
[1:14:49] relatives and so if there's something if
[1:14:52] there's something you to to to give out
[1:14:55] as an
[1:14:57] inheritance what kind of relationship
[1:15:00] you
[1:15:02] have to the one that is the
[1:15:06] owner will declare your
[1:15:10] inheritance amen amen this is I think
[1:15:13] very
[1:15:15] plain The Inheritance is based on
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:23] relationship amen that's why we can see
[1:15:25] the connection the Son and the
[1:15:29] father so we are hirs of
[1:15:32] God through Jesus
[1:15:35] Christ amen so but really the the we
[1:15:38] want to we want to really see what what
[1:15:42] relationship that it was from the
[1:15:47] beginning and we want to see the
[1:15:49] difference uh why the enemy has not a
[1:15:52] relationship to God
[1:15:58] yet God has made
[1:16:00] him but the enemy has no
[1:16:05] relationship that's why he has not an
[1:16:11] inheritance amen and you have an
[1:16:14] inheritance because you have a
[1:16:18] relationship hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:16:21] the closer the relationship is
[1:16:27] the greater The Inheritance will
[1:16:31] be Hallelujah the closer your
[1:16:34] relationship is to
[1:16:36] God you can have different relationships
[1:16:39] to
[1:16:41] God God can be God can be your
[1:16:45] creator you know that's
[1:16:47] wonderful many people they believe in
[1:16:51] God but they have no relationship to
[1:16:55] for
[1:16:56] them God is just some far away
[1:17:02] being some maybe some
[1:17:06] Spirits some unseen
[1:17:09] power but if it is that to
[1:17:13] you you will have no
[1:17:16] inheritance that's why you can people
[1:17:19] they say they believe in
[1:17:21] God but they manifest nothing
[1:17:26] and they manifest nothing because they
[1:17:29] have no
[1:17:31] relationship what you are
[1:17:34] manifesting what you are able to
[1:17:37] manifest you can only
[1:17:39] manifest what you
[1:17:43] are amen we cannot We cannot put
[1:17:46] ourselves different feather in you know
[1:17:50] different
[1:17:53] feathers to to make us a different
[1:17:58] bird we are what we
[1:18:01] are because of the relationship we have
[1:18:04] to
[1:18:06] God hallelujah so so this will this will
[1:18:09] be the day and we will see what kind of
[1:18:11] inheritance that
[1:18:14] is and I I and I want to start actually
[1:18:17] with something that I many times have
[1:18:22] read what the prophet said
[1:18:25] in
[1:18:27] concluding his
[1:18:29] goal what he wanted to
[1:18:33] reach in his ministry in his life what
[1:18:37] his purpose
[1:18:39] was and and and I think that is very
[1:18:44] striking brother Ram said in the in the
[1:18:46] in the church age
[1:18:49] book and he is closing the church age
[1:18:55] do you believe the church age book is
[1:18:56] brother brenham's
[1:19:01] book yet it is written by Brother
[1:19:05] L and brother Brenham said it is my
[1:19:09] book it is my book is that right I mean
[1:19:14] that's very
[1:19:16] important because we have to take take
[1:19:18] it from
[1:19:20] him am amen and here brother brandham
[1:19:24] concludes in the church
[1:19:27] hbook the final
[1:19:32] statement the church ages the resume of
[1:19:35] the
[1:19:38] ages Hallelujah and remember brother Ram
[1:19:41] understood who he
[1:19:44] was he understood his
[1:19:47] position actually in the church
[1:19:51] body he understood that he was the
[1:19:53] church age messenger
[1:19:56] to the Lan
[1:19:58] churches amen is it not
[1:20:01] amazing that brother rham called uh
[1:20:04] called called uh the church let me let
[1:20:07] me let me make no mistake how brother
[1:20:09] bham would call
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:11] it that's very amazing brother bham
[1:20:14] would call the the zadan church
[1:20:18] AG brother bham would call Luther
[1:20:22] AG he would call the Philadelphia Church
[1:20:25] age he would call wesl
[1:20:31] age but he never would call the last
[1:20:33] Church
[1:20:35] age Bram
[1:20:42] age because no Prophet no real
[1:20:47] Prophet will make himself important
[1:20:55] he will always make others
[1:20:59] important and if if you want to find out
[1:21:02] someone that really has a
[1:21:05] Ministry is the one that isn't making
[1:21:08] him
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:12] important if you have to make yourself
[1:21:16] important I wonder what kind of ministry
[1:21:18] you
[1:21:22] have amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:26] amen amen now listen here's brother
[1:21:29] random and in the conclusion of the
[1:21:31] church age
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] book brother vam is
[1:21:37] saying not for one
[1:21:40] moment do I bring a
[1:21:43] message to the people that they may
[1:21:46] follow me or join my
[1:21:50] church or start some fellowship or
[1:21:53] organization
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:57] I've never done that and I will not do
[1:22:00] that
[1:22:01] now listen I have no interest in those
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:10] things amen amen so that was not brother
[1:22:13] Ram's final
[1:22:16] goal to start a briak Bram
[1:22:21] campaign a big group
[1:22:25] to make Jeffersonville the
[1:22:29] headquarter Jeffersonville is not our
[1:22:35] headquarter our headquarter is heaven
[1:22:39] brother and Heaven is consists of the
[1:22:44] word amen hallelujah he said but I have
[1:22:48] I have an
[1:22:51] interest in the things of God and people
[1:22:55] people and if I can accomplish just one
[1:23:01] thing I will be
[1:23:04] satisfied what a
[1:23:09] statement from a
[1:23:11] man that had that had
[1:23:14] signs God gave him
[1:23:16] signs God gave him much more than Moses
[1:23:20] had he had gifts he could pray for the
[1:23:23] sick
[1:23:25] he it right and here that man
[1:23:28] came and he said but if I gu can
[1:23:31] accomplish one
[1:23:33] thing I will be
[1:23:35] satisfied and then one thing is to
[1:23:39] see
[1:23:42] established a true spiritual
[1:23:49] relationship between God and Men
[1:23:56] because we have
[1:23:59] lost our
[1:24:04] relationship we came into this
[1:24:07] world by sexual
[1:24:12] desire we reive we received a spirit
[1:24:15] human
[1:24:17] spirit that was permitted by
[1:24:21] God hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:24:24] amen do you know that brother bam said
[1:24:28] when you receive the Holy
[1:24:30] Ghost you receive that
[1:24:32] spirit that you should have received
[1:24:34] from the
[1:24:40] beginning amen amen so that one thing
[1:24:46] established true spiritual
[1:24:51] relationship between God and man
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:58] established or allow me to
[1:25:01] say
[1:25:04] restor but to really
[1:25:07] establish
[1:25:09] something is that you go
[1:25:11] back to what you
[1:25:16] were amen hallelujah hallelujah listen
[1:25:20] very carefully
[1:25:23] how where in man become a new creation
[1:25:27] in
[1:25:30] Christ filled with his
[1:25:32] spirit and live according to his
[1:25:36] words so as the relationship is restored
[1:25:40] or
[1:25:44] established people become new creatures
[1:25:47] in
[1:25:50] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and they
[1:25:53] receive the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost because we
[1:26:01] understand because you are
[1:26:03] Sons the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:26:07] you the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:10] Ghost don't make you a
[1:26:14] son Paul said because you are
[1:26:18] Sons because you we
[1:26:20] Sons the Holy Spirit comes now to you
[1:26:24] why does the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:26:26] you because your your relationship to
[1:26:30] God is being
[1:26:34] reestablished it's
[1:26:36] restored and in that reestablishing
[1:26:40] process the Holy Spirit comes to you so
[1:26:44] you cannot miss
[1:26:46] it that's why brother Ram said the Holy
[1:26:50] Spirit wants to come more to you
[1:26:54] then you want to receive
[1:27:00] it hallelujah hallelujah what a
[1:27:03] statement we understand we grow we grow
[1:27:07] out of the Pentecostal
[1:27:12] understanding I would call it the baby
[1:27:18] understanding as the CH sorry that's not
[1:27:21] neglecting or making
[1:27:25] Paul would say when I was a
[1:27:30] child I spoke like a
[1:27:34] child is it right I spoke like a child I
[1:27:39] thought like a
[1:27:44] child but then when I became a
[1:27:47] man I put that child is
[1:27:51] thinking and child is talking
[1:27:55] were put
[1:27:56] away why because now I speak as a grown
[1:28:02] man amen and this is what God
[1:28:06] wants God wants to talk to us this
[1:28:09] morning not to little babies
[1:28:12] anymore to about every wind of
[1:28:16] dark little children in the
[1:28:20] sense babies in the
[1:28:22] sense that they don't know if God loves
[1:28:24] them or
[1:28:26] not as soon as they make as soon as they
[1:28:30] make a
[1:28:31] mistake they feel God is not loving them
[1:28:34] anymore and God is
[1:28:40] tired God is
[1:28:42] tired sending us the
[1:28:44] message and then people acting still
[1:28:47] like
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:28:51] this as as the young people
[1:28:55] singing surely we
[1:29:01] fall the prophet said we backslide every
[1:29:10] day we still living in a human
[1:29:14] body that needs a
[1:29:18] change living in a dying body and the
[1:29:21] dying spirit
[1:29:26] uh-huh that's why we fall
[1:29:29] daily but you know what happens you
[1:29:33] fall as you
[1:29:35] fall you quickly stand up
[1:29:41] again Satan can get you to fall every
[1:29:45] day because he puts thought in your
[1:29:49] mind and you accept those thoughts so
[1:29:52] easy
[1:29:54] this is how we
[1:29:56] fall
[1:29:58] accepting Satan's
[1:30:01] ideas Satan's
[1:30:04] thoughts and remember Satan is very
[1:30:08] clever he comes to
[1:30:11] you is it is written
[1:30:24] amen you
[1:30:26] understand come
[1:30:28] on but you know what
[1:30:30] happens as as we as the young people and
[1:30:34] and the sister was
[1:30:35] singing as soon as you
[1:30:38] fall you don't hit the
[1:30:42] ground that's why Satan sooner or
[1:30:46] later gets
[1:30:48] upset and he don't know what to do with
[1:30:51] you anymore
[1:30:54] because as you soon as you fall you come
[1:30:57] up again soon as you fall you come up
[1:31:01] again soon as you fall you come up
[1:31:05] again the just man he
[1:31:09] follows but he stands up
[1:31:11] again he
[1:31:13] stumbles but he rises up again
[1:31:16] hallelujah hallelujah and this is where
[1:31:18] where we are
[1:31:19] now and and uh and and and you will you
[1:31:22] will see you will understand
[1:31:25] what we need so we are not we are not
[1:31:27] little little children
[1:31:29] anymore that when we when we that that
[1:31:32] when we fall we stay on the ground
[1:31:39] crying angry and up angry and upset
[1:31:42] about our
[1:31:47] mistakes we don't talk like children
[1:31:52] anymore hallelujah hallelujah and you

[1:31:57] us this
[1:31:59] morning he told to job one day guard up
[1:32:03] your
[1:32:04] loins to me like a

[1:32:33] exactly what that voice
[1:32:36] means when God said where were you you
[1:32:40] understand I was
[1:32:44] there amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:32:49] and God wants to and remember there's
[1:32:52] the blood of Jesus Christ

[1:33:17] question what voice is he hearing that
[1:33:20] morning this
[1:33:21] morning what voice
[1:33:24] from you comes out under the
[1:33:30] blood what voice you're speaking back to
[1:33:35] him God has a
[1:33:37] desire to talk to his
[1:33:40] church about serious
[1:33:43] matters Hallelujah God wants to
[1:33:46] share his glory with the church he's
[1:33:51] tired of speaking to
[1:34:00] children hallelujah hallelujah amen the
[1:34:04] Bible says we are
[1:34:06] sinners all of
[1:34:08] us saved by
[1:34:12] grace and when you are saved by
[1:34:15] grace you're not a sinner anymore
[1:34:24] then don't talk to
[1:34:26] him like you are still a
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:33] sinner amen you understand you
[1:34:36] understand when I was a
[1:34:38] child I spoke like a child spoke as a
[1:34:43] child my I I have my own
[1:34:45] family my own children my
[1:34:49] boys the ones they were once
[1:34:51] small when they were very small
[1:34:55] you know they were just talking funny
[1:34:58] things you know how they begin to start
[1:35:01] making
[1:35:03] words and then they they they they just
[1:35:05] finally could say Papa and
[1:35:08] Mama and as parents was little baby we
[1:35:11] were
[1:35:15] excited because now they could speak
[1:35:17] Papa and
[1:35:22] Mama but if my my my grownup boy
[1:35:27] today comes to me and my
[1:35:30] wife the only thing he can tell
[1:35:33] us he said Papa
[1:35:38] Mama I'm not so happy with
[1:35:41] him I'm not happy with
[1:35:44] him is is that
[1:35:46] correct when I was a child I was happy
[1:35:50] with him but when he's grown up
[1:35:56] come on Church come on
[1:36:00] Church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:03] hallelujah amen and this is what God is
[1:36:07] when we were
[1:36:08] children Pentecost was the birth of the
[1:36:12] church that's why they all speak in a
[1:36:15] tongue and they were
[1:36:17] moved but God don't want to hear that
[1:36:20] today
[1:36:25] what God wants to hear today from the
[1:36:28] church is not
[1:36:30] only no there's nothing wrong with it
[1:36:32] don't misunder
[1:36:34] understand nothing wrong with that but
[1:36:36] go on from
[1:36:37] there go on from there go on from there
[1:36:42] learn from there don't always go back to
[1:36:45] Baby
[1:36:48] status he understand we can still go in
[1:36:52] the permissive will of
[1:36:55] because of little
[1:36:56] children because of Too
[1:36:58] Young God may allow
[1:37:05] you but what I found out
[1:37:08] is if we stay too
[1:37:11] long in what God
[1:37:14] permits it weakens us
[1:37:24] if we stay too
[1:37:26] long in what God
[1:37:30] permits because we are still acting as
[1:37:32] little
[1:37:34] children if you stayed too long in that
[1:37:39] permissive it will weaken
[1:37:41] you it will weaken finally your
[1:37:45] faith or if you had time we could go
[1:37:47] into into things how David be became
[1:37:50] weakened
[1:37:53] became
[1:37:55] weakened because he was going on God's
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:37:59] permissive things that God
[1:38:02] allowed God had
[1:38:04] allowed to have many
[1:38:07] wives God had allowed that is that right
[1:38:11] and so David was going on that
[1:38:14] line he was he was not when when the
[1:38:18] battle
[1:38:20] was he was not in the front line
[1:38:25] but when the Kings went to
[1:38:27] battle when the Kings went to
[1:38:29] battle David stayed
[1:38:34] home Hallelujah now we don't go with
[1:38:37] this line because but but we have to
[1:38:40] understand we have to understand that
[1:38:43] that there was we had different
[1:38:46] anointings is that right different
[1:38:48] anointings to the church
[1:38:51] ages is that correct we see the first
[1:38:54] two in the beginning it was a lion
[1:38:59] anointing then we understand it was the
[1:39:01] ARX
[1:39:02] anointing then we see it came the eagle
[1:39:05] anointing the man man
[1:39:07] anointing and then at the
[1:39:09] end because as the enemy comes in like a
[1:39:14] flood God has to raise
[1:39:17] the amen God has to raise the standards
[1:39:20] that's why in the ministry of William
[1:39:22] brandham
[1:39:24] you can see a change of an
[1:39:28] anointing a change from an
[1:39:31] anointing brother Ram actually
[1:39:34] started under man
[1:39:38] anointing but there came a Time
[1:39:41] Revelations 10 the prophet called him
[1:39:44] the
[1:39:45] ego when the eag anointing took
[1:39:49] over and how many people want to go back
[1:39:54] today under man
[1:40:01] anointing and you understand as a good
[1:40:05] father
[1:40:06] is when little
[1:40:09] Johnny one so
[1:40:12] bad to have that
[1:40:15] tool to play
[1:40:17] with Father might allow
[1:40:21] it I hope you
[1:40:25] understand amen I hope you understand so
[1:40:29] we people today but to me as we are
[1:40:33] grown up we are not like little children
[1:40:37] anymore so that we want to play with
[1:40:40] something God has
[1:40:43] given and maybe show with that
[1:40:46] anointing how powerful we
[1:40:51] are only little children
[1:40:53] children try to show and manifest who
[1:40:56] they
[1:40:57] are look what I
[1:40:59] can fighting in the
[1:41:02] sandbox against brothers and
[1:41:05] sisters showing who they
[1:41:08] are taking the tool of the
[1:41:11] daddy and with that tool trying to show
[1:41:14] how big they
[1:41:15] are to me this is childish
[1:41:20] playing and God because he loves his
[1:41:22] children
[1:41:24] he might
[1:41:26] permit you to
[1:41:28] work under a past
[1:41:38] anointing but if you stay too long under
[1:41:45] that if you play too
[1:41:48] long was a
[1:41:50] tool it weakens your growth
[1:41:55] come on Church it weakens your
[1:41:59] growth and I want my
[1:42:02] children getting out of the
[1:42:06] sandbox playing with the tools I gave
[1:42:10] them I want my
[1:42:13] children today in my
[1:42:16] business not playing in the sandbox
[1:42:20] anymore not playing in the kindergarten
[1:42:22] anymore
[1:42:24] but I want them to be with
[1:42:27] me in my
[1:42:29] kingdom so I can
[1:42:31] say if you see
[1:42:33] them you see
[1:42:35] me he can do the same thing I have
[1:42:39] done
[1:42:41] actually
[1:42:42] actually my
[1:42:44] son is a
[1:42:47] continuation of
[1:42:51] myself Hallelujah
[1:42:54] hallelujah amen this is what God wants
[1:42:56] to see
[1:42:58] today God God don't want to hear from
[1:43:02] us you know as you are
[1:43:05] fallen and as you are a a young young
[1:43:09] believer if you make a big
[1:43:12] mistake and Satan comes around and he
[1:43:15] can tell you you make so many
[1:43:18] mistakes you God God don't love you
[1:43:21] anymore God
[1:43:26] but this is childish
[1:43:33] thinking amen when I was a child I spoke
[1:43:38] as a
[1:43:40] child I acted as a
[1:43:42] child but when the time
[1:43:44] came the time of adoption
[1:43:48] came I put away childish thinking
[1:43:54] hallelujah amen you understand that and
[1:43:58] and and and as we see as as the the Lord
[1:44:02] is is is going or or how it is
[1:44:06] continuing I'm just feeling impressed to
[1:44:08] go back to my
[1:44:10] subject Amen to to uh to to go to go
[1:44:14] back to really to show what it
[1:44:16] is but is this is what God wants to hear
[1:44:20] today and and as as I said
[1:44:24] because it's so
[1:44:25] important that we understand God wants
[1:44:29] to bring
[1:44:30] us God wants to have a relationship to
[1:44:35] man that he
[1:44:39] lost in the Garden of
[1:44:42] Eden that he lost in the Garden of
[1:44:46] Eden hallelujah amen amen that
[1:44:49] relationship
[1:44:52] exists between God and man do you
[1:44:55] believe that amen there was a
[1:44:57] relationship that
[1:44:59] exist between God and
[1:45:03] man amen in this
[1:45:06] relationship brother Bron wanted to see
[1:45:09] established
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:15] again it will help
[1:45:17] you to quicker stand
[1:45:21] up if you are
[1:45:25] Fallen remember how the devil is so
[1:45:28] clever he makes you to
[1:45:31] fall he puts that thought in your
[1:45:35] mind and because of
[1:45:37] circumstances you don't discern quick
[1:45:40] enough that it is the
[1:45:43] enemy and you find
[1:45:46] yourself in a fallen
[1:45:51] condition amen
[1:45:53] and as he makes you
[1:45:56] fall he comes
[1:45:59] around and condemns
[1:46:02] you for what he has
[1:46:06] done because you didn't make your own
[1:46:10] fall see if brother Samson is
[1:46:14] going if he walks just
[1:46:16] walk and if I put his legs
[1:46:20] away and he falls on the ground
[1:46:24] and then they come around and tell him
[1:46:27] oh you are
[1:46:34] Fallen you
[1:46:36] understand and then brother Samson on
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:40] ground if he's not grown
[1:46:42] up he feels
[1:46:45] stupid he feels
[1:46:48] unable he said my goodness how stupid I
[1:46:52] am
[1:46:53] no you are not stupid somebody make you
[1:47:00] fall and you understand as he may lay
[1:47:04] down
[1:47:06] weeping feeling
[1:47:08] unworthy feeling not
[1:47:10] able why can I not
[1:47:13] walk he stays down he stays down and
[1:47:17] this is where Satan wants to keep
[1:47:20] you he wants to keep you down
[1:47:24] amen he don't want you to know who you
[1:47:30] are but I tell you how
[1:47:35] quickly even if I make brother Samson to
[1:47:39] four if he know who he is and he knows
[1:47:43] what is going
[1:47:45] on and he knows who make him
[1:47:49] fall he will not lay on the ground but
[1:47:52] she quickly come out and walk
[1:47:55] on and one day Satan gets so tired
[1:48:00] because he cannot get you to the ground
[1:48:03] anymore as soon as you fall you come
[1:48:06] up you know why brother Samson would
[1:48:09] come up
[1:48:10] quickly when he knows who he is when he
[1:48:13] knows what he
[1:48:16] can come on
[1:48:18] church he
[1:48:21] knows I was always able to
[1:48:29] walk Come On
[1:48:31] Church we're coming back to a
[1:48:35] relationship where you always were like
[1:48:43] God somebody can say
[1:48:46] amen hallelujah hallelujah when God
[1:48:50] created you
[1:48:52] created you not from
[1:48:55] nothing he created you from
[1:49:01] himself
[1:49:03] hallelujah
[1:49:04] hallelujah I I I hope you
[1:49:08] understand when he created
[1:49:12] Satan
[1:49:13] uhhuh from
[1:49:15] nothing that's why Satan is going back
[1:49:19] to nothing
[1:49:25] but when he created his church when he
[1:49:28] created Adam when he created
[1:49:31] you he created you from
[1:49:36] something he created you from
[1:49:42] existence come on
[1:49:44] church he made
[1:49:46] you from
[1:49:49] himself as he made
[1:49:53] woman from the
[1:49:56] man amen hallelujah
[1:50:00] hallelujah sometimes that word
[1:50:03] creation can be a little
[1:50:06] confusing Satan can come
[1:50:10] around and he can tell you I'm also
[1:50:19] created he can tell you you know who my
[1:50:23] Creator
[1:50:33] is so he can tell you the same one that
[1:50:36] created you created
[1:50:41] me so
[1:50:46] what you understand and he's
[1:50:49] right he can even quote
[1:50:53] Ezekiel
[1:50:55] 28 you
[1:50:57] see I was
[1:51:02] perfect come on
[1:51:07] Church created
[1:51:11] perfect then you must have an
[1:51:13] answer are you not
[1:51:16] glad that God gave us the answer in this
[1:51:18] hour
[1:51:23] he showed us where we come
[1:51:28] from and he showed
[1:51:30] us and you can tell
[1:51:32] Satan Satan we don't have to argue about
[1:51:37] this you just have to accept
[1:51:40] that I come from
[1:51:43] God from an
[1:51:45] existence and you come from
[1:51:48] God from nothing
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:55] we go a little later you will
[1:51:57] understand how brother Adam even telling
[1:52:00] their people today on
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:03] Earth that God don't
[1:52:05] know you can tell
[1:52:08] Satan God don't know
[1:52:14] you there was a group of
[1:52:17] people that came to him and he had to
[1:52:20] tell them
[1:52:25] they told
[1:52:26] him they told
[1:52:28] God we have done so many things in your
[1:52:33] name you know what he
[1:52:36] said I don't know
[1:52:41] you sure you know
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:51] us here we go here we go here we
[1:52:55] understand surely God you know
[1:52:58] us you made us you created us and yet he
[1:53:02] could tell them I don't know
[1:53:06] you but I created you from
[1:53:16] nothing come on we don't have to argue
[1:53:19] with
[1:53:21] God God is
[1:53:23] God and he can do whatever he
[1:53:26] wants he do not have to have my
[1:53:29] permission he do not have to have your
[1:53:32] permission he doesn't need Satan's
[1:53:36] permission he can do whatever he
[1:53:39] wants and if he
[1:53:41] decided to create me out of
[1:53:46] himself then it was his decision
[1:53:53] oh we go there a little
[1:53:55] later but you will understand we have
[1:53:58] the
[1:53:59] answer to Satan's
[1:54:04] questions Hallelujah I think that's so
[1:54:07] important because as I said if brother
[1:54:10] Samson is
[1:54:12] falling and maybe the 10 time he's
[1:54:15] falling he
[1:54:18] feelsy and the enemy is very clever you
[1:54:21] know
[1:54:22] you know sometimes how when we were
[1:54:24] little children or younger younger
[1:54:27] teenagers we had a little
[1:54:30] game we was walk with one
[1:54:33] another and somebody was just little
[1:54:36] kicking and the other one
[1:54:39] Tumbl you know I don't know if you do
[1:54:42] the same thing in
[1:54:45] Africa we had so it was not who did
[1:54:49] this who tried to bring me to fall
[1:54:54] and as you were walking
[1:54:56] youed little little with a leg kick
[1:54:59] little in the back this is what Satan is
[1:55:02] doing as you walk in his sight he talks
[1:55:05] to you and they kick and then you
[1:55:12] fall come on church this is how he's
[1:55:15] doing it and then you tumble you stand
[1:55:18] up you tumble you stand up and after 10
[1:55:22] times nearly
[1:55:26] fall you
[1:55:28] think am I so
[1:55:36] stupid this is what happens to many
[1:55:39] people Satan makes them fall so many
[1:55:42] times and finally they stay on the
[1:55:46] ground start crying to
[1:55:48] Papa I cannot walk
[1:55:56] now what is God
[1:55:58] doing he's not playing childish games
[1:56:01] with
[1:56:02] us you know what he's doing he shows you
[1:56:06] pictures of
[1:56:09] yourself when you could walk before you
[1:56:13] came here to
[1:56:16] Earth and he tells
[1:56:18] you as soon as Satan makes you fall
[1:56:22] remember that
[1:56:25] picture because from the
[1:56:28] beginning
[1:56:30] Hallelujah when you were
[1:56:33] created when Adam was
[1:56:38] created he was not created a
[1:56:44] baby when God made
[1:56:47] you he didn't make you a baby
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] come on church when he formed when he
[1:56:56] made the woman out of the
[1:57:00] man even the
[1:57:04] byproduct came as a full grown
[1:57:08] woman come on church not as a little
[1:57:11] baby no as a beautiful matur
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:19] lady Hallelujah
[1:57:22] Hallelujah so you understand as as enemy
[1:57:25] makes you fall hear that church it's
[1:57:26] very
[1:57:27] important it's very important because
[1:57:31] this is what Satan is trying to do
[1:57:33] getting the church the True
[1:57:35] Believers to live below their
[1:57:38] privilege making them fall making them
[1:57:42] fall and with this modern media what we
[1:57:45] have today young
[1:57:47] people which is modern media what we
[1:57:50] have today
[1:57:52] how quickly he can get you to
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:58:01] fall so more and more we need this to
[1:58:06] know when you are when you are fallen or
[1:58:09] when you are
[1:58:12] stumbling go back to the
[1:58:15] picture that God sent to you about
[1:58:18] yourself in this
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:24] this is who you
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:27] were come on church this is who you
[1:58:34] were before the foundation of the
[1:58:36] [Applause]
[1:58:38] world in
[1:58:40] him do you believe you wear an attribute
[1:58:43] in
[1:58:45] him do you believe you were an
[1:58:49] attribute who can believe he was an
[1:58:51] attribute
[1:59:01] oh my oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:05] brother Bram would
[1:59:06] say God make made a picture of

[1:59:28] open and out of the open

[1:59:48] telling the nice story of that of that
[1:59:50] of that of that poor woman

[2:04:02] again just this will go to the
[2:04:06] end because brother Bram said in these
[2:04:10] bodies in these bodies we will have
[2:04:13] problems to the
[2:04:17] end because they need still
[2:04:20] Redemption is that right
[2:04:22] that's why we need a body
[2:04:24] change we living in dying
[2:04:26] bodies with dying
[2:04:29] Spirits that's why in these
[2:04:32] days so so many mental problems out
[2:04:36] there brother sister if you are mentally
[2:04:41] struggling that is not
[2:04:48] you you are on the inside
[2:04:54] hallelujah hallelujah you understand how
[2:04:57] brother Brandon would say somebody that
[2:05:00] is
[2:05:02] insane can have the Holy
[2:05:10] Ghost come on
[2:05:14] Church you better believe that yeah come
[2:05:17] on church because we're living in a
[2:05:20] dying body and the ding
[2:05:29] come on Church yes you better say
[2:05:32] Amen you might be so weak in your
[2:05:36] spirit brother Bram came to a
[2:05:39] point when he was so weak in his human
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:48] Spirit come on
[2:05:50] church so weak
[2:05:53] so
[2:05:54] weak you know how weak he
[2:05:57] became you know
[2:06:00] why the devil could tell
[2:06:03] him God don't love you
[2:06:09] anymore brother bam said Satan couldn't
[2:06:13] tell
[2:06:13] me that there is no
[2:06:16] God because I know there is a
[2:06:20] God we all know that there is a God is
[2:06:22] that right we have seen it so many times
[2:06:26] we know there is a living
[2:06:28] God but he could get brother brandham
[2:06:31] because of brother Bram making a
[2:06:34] mistake he could get brother brandham
[2:06:37] mentally
[2:06:41] solo telling
[2:06:43] him telling him because of your
[2:06:46] mistakes God don't love you anymore
[2:06:53] and if you accept
[2:06:55] that you stay on the
[2:06:58] ground come on
[2:07:01] church but I would deny
[2:07:05] it
[2:07:06] because the Bible tells us God tells us
[2:07:11] that his
[2:07:13] love is
[2:07:17] divine hallelujah hallelujah as we as we
[2:07:21] I thinking it's it's very
[2:07:22] important God is not loving
[2:07:25] you as a father human speaking would
[2:07:28] love his
[2:07:32] son God's
[2:07:34] love is elective
[2:07:39] love somebody can say
[2:07:43] amen that's
[2:07:45] why God cannot love you more
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:53] and God can never love you
[2:08:00] less you can see
[2:08:02] that
[2:08:05] amen can you say praise the
[2:08:08] Lord stay stay
[2:08:13] focused God loved
[2:08:15] you when you were still a
[2:08:20] sinner this is what the Bible
[2:08:23] tells when you became a
[2:08:26] Christian when you repented when you get
[2:08:30] baptized do you think God loved you
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:46] more God cannot love you
[2:08:50] more because his love is
[2:08:56] divine when God cannot love you
[2:08:59] more as parents when our children bring
[2:09:03] honor to
[2:09:05] us seems we love them
[2:09:09] much what do you do if your child brings
[2:09:12] this honor to
[2:09:16] you come
[2:09:18] on we would love it less is that right
[2:09:23] right come on Church yes this is
[2:09:26] what not so
[2:09:31] God God cannot love you
[2:09:33] more and he cannot love you
[2:09:36] less because God's love is
[2:09:41] [Applause]
[2:09:43] elective you know how you know that God
[2:09:46] loves
[2:09:47] you because he chose
[2:09:49] you that's his love to
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:55] you regardless what
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:00] matters good
[2:10:02] days are not a
[2:10:09] sign that God might be pleased with
[2:10:12] you bad days is not a sign that God is
[2:10:16] displeased
[2:10:22] you know how brother brandham gets so
[2:10:24] low in
[2:10:27] church as we are in a neurotic
[2:10:31] age also here in
[2:10:34] Africa you see lot of crazy
[2:10:42] people yes you see them so we living in
[2:10:45] a neurotic
[2:10:47] age is that right in this neurotic age
[2:10:52] in this crazy
[2:10:53] world brother Ram would
[2:10:56] say literally they go
[2:11:02] crazy normality is
[2:11:04] abnormal and abnormality is
[2:11:08] [Music]
[2:11:15] normal you understand this is the world
[2:11:18] we are living in this is what is
[2:11:21] presented to you on social
[2:11:25] media that's why young people be very
[2:11:31] careful I'm not against
[2:11:37] things but I don't need
[2:11:43] Facebook I have I have my
[2:11:48] face in this book
[2:11:51] [Applause]
[2:11:56] and when I when when I say I I don't
[2:12:00] need I don't say it is a sin to have
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:07] it I just said I don't
[2:12:13] need and I'm
[2:12:15] aware that with all these social
[2:12:18] media whatever that is
[2:12:22] this crazy
[2:12:25] world is influencing
[2:12:33] you and you cannot stop
[2:12:37] it come on Church you have your
[2:12:43] telephone there it
[2:12:48] comes there it comes
[2:12:52] it is a tree of Good and Evil is that
[2:12:55] right so even in the Garden of
[2:12:58] Eden God will tell them don't
[2:13:03] eat is it okay for me to say
[2:13:06] that use it but don't eat
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:12] it use it as we have need of eating
[2:13:17] becomes one with it
[2:13:22] come on
[2:13:23] church allow me to say use
[2:13:26] it but don't eat
[2:13:31] [Applause]
[2:13:33] it amen because the influence of this
[2:13:36] crazy
[2:13:39] world you are constantly confronted with
[2:13:45] that and there's no hidden place in
[2:13:48] Uganda
[2:13:52] it is
[2:13:53] everywhere we are living in Satan's Eden
[2:13:56] do you believe
[2:13:58] that whatever corner of the world you
[2:14:00] are trying to
[2:14:03] hide we are living in Satan's
[2:14:07] Eden that's why I believe we needed this
[2:14:13] message so the standed can be
[2:14:17] raised
[2:14:18] Hallelujah so that we can stay
[2:14:24] normal
[2:14:26] literally you see the
[2:14:29] increase allow me to say that
[2:14:32] um I heard of brother Donnie
[2:14:35] Reagan brother Donnie
[2:14:37] Reagan they had a youth meeting just a
[2:14:40] couple of weeks
[2:14:43] ago or a family

[2:19:11] falling your picture comes up who you
[2:19:14] are and you rise up again and you start

[2:24:39] answer for the challenges of
[2:24:42] today is it right the only
[2:24:47] answer is Jesus Christ
[2:24:51] today unveiled it's only
[2:24:55] [Applause]
[2:24:56] chance Hallelujah h i speak of
[2:25:00] experience I speak of firsthand

[2:42:16] courage For unto these people
[2:42:20] shall thou
[2:42:23] divide foreign inheritance the
[2:42:31] land you catch

[2:42:37] divite the
[2:42:39] land as an
[2:42:42] [Music]
[2:42:43] inheritance so the land was not given
[2:42:46] out
[2:42:49] as a free
[2:42:53] gift it was
[2:42:56] connected to an
[2:42:58] inheritance and
[2:43:01] inheritance is connected to a
[2:43:04] [Music]
[2:43:06] relationship with other words
[2:43:08] yes divide the
[2:43:11] land that's why a
[2:43:13] stranger that's why a stranger could not
[2:43:17] go into the land
[2:43:19] and say this is what I want to have and
[2:43:22] that is what I want to have it was only
[2:43:25] for
[2:43:26] those that were
[2:43:33] related is that not
[2:43:35] amazing so all the promised land all the
[2:43:40] inheritance is connected to a
[2:43:42] [Music]
[2:43:44] relationship take another scripture

[2:43:50] want to read that
[2:43:52] again now now now we we will we will see
[2:43:55] what Joshua finally has
[2:44:00] done Joshua
[2:44:03] 11:23
[2:44:05] Joshua took the whole land yeah bring it
[2:44:09] up whole land according to all that the
[2:44:13] Lord said unto Moses and Joshua gave it
[2:44:17] fore an inheritance unto Israel

[2:44:25] [Music]
[2:44:41] tribes amen so the promised land come on
[2:44:46] Church The Inheritance
[2:44:49] the promised land shall be given out
[2:44:55] divided as an
[2:44:59] inheritance that
[2:45:01] means Satan has no
[2:45:06] rights on any of
[2:45:12] it everything that Satan was possessing
[2:45:19] he took it
[2:45:22] illegally he was actually a squatter on
[2:45:25] the
[2:45:27] ground that's why isra Israel went
[2:45:33] in and kicked the enemies
[2:45:37] out because that land belongs to
[2:45:43] them you know why it belongs to
[2:45:46] them because God gave it to

[2:46:03] God but now God wants to give his
[2:46:08] land who he
[2:46:10] is as an
[2:46:13] inheritance not to
[2:46:15] Satan because only to those

[2:58:52] one that is inheriting us
[2:58:56] something is not
[2:59:00] Jesus but it is the
[2:59:03] father is
[2:59:07] God Amen then we are not hes of
[2:59:15] Jesus we are hes of God
[2:59:19] through
[2:59:20] Jesus remember it was always
[2:59:25] God it was always
[2:59:28] God he started
[2:59:31] it hallelujah hallelujah before Jesus
[2:59:34] came on the
[2:59:35] scene that's why brother Ram could
[2:59:38] say Jesus had a
[2:59:45] beginning hallelujah hallelujah but here
[2:59:48] we have
[2:59:49] someone that had no
[2:59:54] beginning hold that for a
[2:59:57] moment you are Heirs of

[3:00:03] father trying to
[3:00:09] inherit oh yes yes yes here we go I have
[3:00:13] I don't have my wife with me
[3:00:18] I don't have my wife with

[3:00:37] right and
[3:00:39] God has a
[3:00:46] bride amen am is that
[3:00:53] right amen am do we believe
[3:01:00] that oh my you see if we it is always
[3:01:04] the
[3:01:07] father is it not
[3:01:13] marvelous that when Adam was there come
[3:01:17] again when Adam was
[3:01:20] there God looked at
[3:01:23] him and God
[3:01:25] said it is not
[3:01:27] good that man is
[3:01:30] alone it was not Adam telling the
[3:01:35] father father I think it's not good that
[3:01:38] I
[3:01:40] [Music]
[3:01:42] Al it was God looking
[3:01:46] down said it is not God
[3:01:54] because God
[3:01:55] knows how it is to be
[3:01:59] [Music]
[3:02:02] alone you know what alone
[3:02:07] means
[3:02:09] alone means
[3:02:11] all in one
[3:02:21] [Music]
[3:02:25] if you can write
[3:02:27] it it's a l
[3:02:30] all and then in o n e all in one that
[3:02:35] means
[3:02:36] [Music]
[3:02:39] alone so when God was
[3:02:43] alone it was
[3:02:46] all in one
[3:02:49] and God said it is not good that Adam is
[3:02:58] [Applause]
[3:03:04] all the Bible tells us come on
[3:03:08] Church the Bible tells us when
[3:03:11] finally the son has given all back to
[3:03:15] the father
[3:03:18] then he will be
[3:03:20] all in all in
[3:03:28] all then it's not all in one
[3:03:31] [Applause]
[3:03:33] [Music]
[3:03:35] anymore I don't know if you have the
[3:03:36] scripture
[3:03:39] there Hallelujah church can you get that
[3:03:43] the final
[3:03:46] stage that we are walking into
[3:03:50] eternity is God not being all in
[3:03:56] one now God is
[3:04:00] all in
[3:04:03] [Applause]
[3:04:08] all that's the whole
[3:04:11] story that's God's
[3:04:14] purpose that's why Jesus died
[3:04:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:04:19] [Music]
[3:04:23] hallelujah hallelujah so it was always
[3:04:26] the
[3:04:27] father it was not it was not Adam saying
[3:04:30] oh God I feel so
[3:04:33] alone God looked to Adam I think Adam
[3:04:36] was quite happy
[3:04:48] because the woman would cause him only
[3:04:52] trouble the woman would cause him only
[3:05:06] trouble God looked at
[3:05:09] him and he said it's not
[3:05:11] good that man is
[3:05:13] alone I will make him
[3:05:20] you understand it is always God's
[3:05:26] business is it not is it not amazing our
[3:05:30] great love story
[3:05:34] of is it not amazing the great love
[3:05:37] story of Rebecca and
[3:05:41] Isaac you know one
[3:05:43] day Isaac oh he felt so lonely
[3:05:51] no no one day Abraham
[3:06:01] said son needs a
[3:06:10] wife I don't know what what I you know
[3:06:13] what I mean the Bible never said that
[3:06:15] Isaac had a word to it
[3:06:28] can you see this can you see the the
[3:06:31] principal so it was
[3:06:35] Abraham the father telling to
[3:06:38] elazar make
[3:06:41] sure wait a
[3:06:43] minute it was not
[3:06:46] Isaac telling
[3:06:59] in the
[3:07:00] beginning you know what God
[3:07:03] did to make really sure that we in
[3:07:10] 2024 understand that
[3:07:12] principle he put Adam in a deep sleep
[3:07:23] so that everybody will clearly
[3:07:27] understand the woman was not Adam's
[3:07:32] Choice the woman was not Adam's product
[3:07:37] the woman was not made by Adam the woman
[3:07:40] was not done by Adam
[3:07:47] what happened at
[3:07:52] Calvary God
[3:07:55] waited God
[3:07:57] waited so
[3:07:59] long till Jesus had
[3:08:04] died is that
[3:08:06] right finally he was
[3:08:09] dead because they wanted to break his
[3:08:11] bones and they found out he's dead
[3:08:14] already then God used even an
[3:08:19] enemy not a
[3:08:22] disciple they were cowards hiding
[3:08:29] somewhere but God used the
[3:08:31] enemy God is always using the
[3:08:34] enemy because many Believers are too
[3:08:37] much cowards
[3:08:48] he came an
[3:08:50] enemy and when they seen he was
[3:08:52] already they pushed the spear
[3:08:56] in and brother said there the bride came
[3:09:00] out
[3:09:03] of Hallelujah
[3:09:05] Hallelujah so Jesus Jesus is not making
[3:09:10] his own
[3:09:11] bride it is the
[3:09:13] father responsible
[3:09:17] God Made
[3:09:19] You he brought you
[3:09:23] here
[3:09:29] hallelujah can we call
[3:09:32] it as brother random would call
[3:09:35] it in the message invisible
[3:09:40] Union is said okay when I read that as
[3:09:45] closing then we let we start in the
[3:09:49] afternoon because I think that's
[3:09:52] beautiful to see the level of
[3:09:58] relationship what was the relationship
[3:10:00] between Adam and
[3:10:04] Eve they were
[3:10:06] one she came from
[3:10:10] him what is the
[3:10:13] relationship between the bride to
[3:10:16] Christ she's
[3:10:18] him she comes from him she's him in
[3:10:21] another
[3:10:23] [Music]
[3:10:25] form to
[3:10:27] express all that God
[3:10:33] is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[3:10:45] hallelujah I just have to read one quote
[3:10:48] because there's too
[3:10:50] many the prophet would
[3:10:53] say so you were sons of
[3:10:56] God and Daughters of
[3:10:58] God before there even was the moon in
[3:11:01] the star or
[3:11:06] molecule you were Sons and Daughters of
[3:11:09] God for you are only the physical
[3:11:11] manifestation of the attributes that was
[3:11:14] in God in the beginning
[3:11:16] [Music]
[3:11:20] for there only one form of eternal
[3:11:24] life and that was you
[3:11:27] [Music]
[3:11:30] before can we say Amen to that there's
[3:11:34] only one form of eternal life and that
[3:11:37] was you before
[3:11:48] to whom to whom is he
[3:11:55] speaking to
[3:12:00] me is he speaking to
[3:12:04] you who is at
[3:12:07] you can I see your
[3:12:13] hands there's only one form of eternal
[3:12:16] life and that was you
[3:12:21] before you don't know nothing about
[3:12:25] it neither did you know when you was in
[3:12:28] your father's
[3:12:34] loins
[3:12:37] Ley
[3:12:38] Ley yet in the loins of
[3:12:43] Abraham is that right
[3:12:48] I mean I was in the Lo of my
[3:12:50] father and I know nothing about
[3:12:58] it but you know how I know I
[3:13:02] was because I see in
[3:13:04] me things that my father
[3:13:10] was so I know yeah I come from him
[3:13:19] H the prophet would say it is like an
[3:13:28] evolution he said look at this it's not
[3:13:31] Evolution like the schools tell
[3:13:37] us but an evolution is always God
[3:13:39] showing more of
[3:13:41] [Music]
[3:13:43] him like Luther sanctification justif
[3:13:47] justification under Luther
[3:13:50] sanctification under
[3:13:52] vesley the evolution of the
[3:13:56] spirit more and more because a body is
[3:14:02] building finally coming to the
[3:14:05] head which is Christ the body of
[3:14:11] Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[3:14:14] hallelujah let me read one quote
[3:14:17] and we are
[3:14:18] closing but I think that's so powerful
[3:14:22] statement of the
[3:14:28] Prophet listen in the message countdown
[3:14:33] 1962 he said he made first the
[3:14:37] trees and the botony
[3:14:41] life then he made
[3:14:43] man and then the last thing that ever
[3:14:46] come from the
[3:14:47] Earth in the form of
[3:14:50] creation was a man nothing higher ever
[3:14:55] came because why it was a perfect
[3:15:03] reflection of the highest in
[3:15:09] heaven it was the perfect
[3:15:12] reflection of the highest in heaven
[3:15:15] which God is
[3:15:19] [Music]
[3:15:26] go a little bit
[3:15:28] [Music]
[3:15:30] up you see God is a
[3:15:34] man so therefore it proves
[3:15:44] it hallelujah hallelujah
[3:15:48] God is a man and a man it shows that the
[3:15:51] Perfection of
[3:15:56] evolution the Perfection of evolution go
[3:15:59] a little bit
[3:16:03] up was
[3:16:06] God which is a
[3:16:12] man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[3:16:16] hallelujah can you understand
[3:16:19] that nothing
[3:16:25] higher the Perfection of
[3:16:29] evolution was
[3:16:31] God which is a
[3:16:39] man these
[3:16:41] Bible is how many books
[3:16:45] [Music]
[3:16:50] 66 not such a good
[3:16:53] number six is the number of
[3:16:56] men six is the number of
[3:17:00] men why this Bible has 66
[3:17:04] [Music]
[3:17:05] books
[3:17:07] Isaiah how many chapters is in Isaiah
[3:17:17] it should be
[3:17:21] 55 or maybe
[3:17:24] 33 or maybe
[3:17:27] 77 or the best would be
[3:17:33] 88 but God choose
[3:17:40] 66 hallelujah hallelujah that precious
[3:17:45] book 66
[3:17:49] telling the story of
[3:17:51] [Music]
[3:17:55] man the highest form of
[3:18:01] evolution which is God is
[3:18:08] man that's why in the beginning of the
[3:18:12] Bible is the spirit of God moved upon
[3:18:15] the waters
[3:18:18] and the spirit
[3:18:20] spoke at the end of the
[3:18:22] Bible said the

[3:24:40] service praise the
[3:24:42] Lord I enjoyed the ministers here
[3:24:47] they were following very closely and I
[3:24:49] thank God to
[3:24:51] that their
[3:24:56] impact the impact of our restored
[3:25:00] relationship of our inherit
[3:25:19] praise the
[3:25:20] Lord so we thank God for this
[3:25:24] service I really like the scripture that
[3:25:27] he
[3:25:29] read that when you're
[3:25:32] born potentially you are
[3:25:35] here but you are not different from a
[3:25:39] servant meaning that God has got some
[3:25:42] work to do on
[3:25:44] us and in that
[3:25:46] work the closer your relationship with
[3:25:51] God he says is the greater the
[3:25:56] inheritances so we are given the message
[3:25:59] of the we are given the
[3:26:02] word without
[3:26:04] limitation but the way we use that
[3:26:08] message would determine the level of
[3:26:11] inheritance that we enjoy
[3:26:16] as children of God you think like a
[3:26:21] child will always affect your fellowship
[3:26:24] with
[3:26:25] God we've been given the message dig
[3:26:29] into the
[3:26:30] message renew your
[3:26:33] mind think mat like the Ephesian
[3:26:36] church amen devel
[3:26:39] mind that God will
[3:26:42] anoint to make a man out of you
[3:26:46] amen have an image have a
[3:26:50] picture of what you want God to make
[3:26:54] you amen I was just imagining the
[3:26:59] gross of brother
[3:27:01] Bram as is seen in the changing of his
[3:27:06] mind thinking
[3:27:09] different like
[3:27:11] 1963 the opening of the
[3:27:14] seals then brother Bram calling it a new
[3:27:18] ministry he says the Bible became a new
[3:27:22] book he was lifting him
[3:27:25] up with a totally different
[3:27:29] Ministry not operating by a
[3:27:33] gift but he had to wait for the word
[3:27:37] himself to do a work in his
[3:27:40] people he revealed to him what God had
[3:27:44] always wanted him to break in
[3:27:47] the creative
[3:27:49] anointing amen so he came to the
[3:27:53] understanding open up your
[3:27:56] mind amen think like a mature person the
[3:28:00] more relationship you have with
[3:28:03] God is the
[3:28:05] greater the impact it will
[3:28:09] produce in your relationship with
[3:28:12] God Amen and you know you you you you
[3:28:16] need to know who you
[3:28:19] are you need to know what you
[3:28:22] are you need to know what your position

[3:28:35] know what you are supposed to be when
[3:28:37] you are
[3:28:41] standing what will you stand back
[3:28:44] to amen he says when Satan
[3:28:48] fell he had no restoration
[3:28:51] point because he was created from
[3:28:55] nothing but you and me we came from the
[3:28:59] word when we fall we have a feeling of
[3:29:02] the word calling us
[3:29:05] back the Ephesian Church they knew where
[3:29:09] they fell from God will tell them go
[3:29:11] back to the restoration
[3:29:13] point when Israel was in Egypt
[3:29:17] they knew where they fell from they had
[3:29:19] to go back to
[3:29:20] Canaan when they Israel fell and went to
[3:29:25] babon they knew where to go
