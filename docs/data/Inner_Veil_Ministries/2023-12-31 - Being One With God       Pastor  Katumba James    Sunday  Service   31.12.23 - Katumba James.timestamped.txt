[17:55] until this
[17:57] morning just back this
[17:59] morning I want to bring greetings from
[18:02] Pastor
[18:06] Robert even
[18:09] Pastor Ken say from South Africa is done
[18:12] taking those
[18:14] Services
[18:17] Kellen and then also from the other
[18:20] pastors brother Emmanuel brother Jo
[18:22] brother
[18:24] Ste they s
[18:27] their praise name of the Lord even our
[18:30] pastor also sent his
[18:32] greetings you just remember me in your
[18:34] prayers his ministering in brother
[18:37] Andrea's church
[18:39] today praise the name of the Lord then
[18:42] there also who went to
[18:47] Convention which started on Friday so
[18:50] you also keep them in your prayers at
[18:52] least I know brother Dan M and his
[18:55] family they went
[18:57] there
[18:59] praise the name of our Lord so today we
[19:01] have two
[19:03] Services we have this morning service
[19:06] and then the afternoon
[19:08] service then immediately after the
[19:10] afternoon service shall start the Lord
[19:14] supper praise the name of the Lord so
[19:17] you just need to keep
[19:18] around and be able to participate in the
[19:21] services of the
[19:23] Lord and as we had
[19:27] said this is the end of the year we
[19:29] thank God praise the name of our Lord
[19:33] and I know there are many
[19:35] places where they prepare to have an
[19:39] overnight and some places are calling it
[19:44] crossovers are calling it
[19:48] Passover praise the name of our Lord and
[19:51] certainly it's good to wait on the Lord
[19:53] even at
[19:54] night but God does not only hear your
[19:57] prayers at night
[20:00] praise the name of our Lord neither does
[20:03] God say maybe you all have to congregate
[20:05] in one place then I hear your
[20:08] prayers praise the name of our Lord so
[20:11] it depends on how different churches are
[20:15] late but for us we believe what we have
[20:18] here is
[20:20] adequate praise the name of Lord and
[20:23] then we thank God for ending this
[20:26] year praise the name of
[20:31] so with effect from next
[20:34] year we are going to have the Lord
[20:37] supper every
[20:39] month praise the name of our Lord now
[20:42] for this month of January which is
[20:44] starting
[20:46] tomorrow we are taking it
[20:48] today praise the name of our Lord as
[20:51] well as ending
[20:52] the but every first Sunday of the
[20:57] month
[20:58] so that will be now in
[21:01] February we shall also have the Lord
[21:04] supper and that will be fourth of
[21:07] February and we want to maintain it like
[21:09] that through the
[21:11] year at the Brom
[21:14] Tabernacle they used to keep it during
[21:16] the time of brother
[21:18] Bram at least every month they used to
[21:20] hold
[21:21] it and then the scripture says in the
[21:24] book of
[21:26] Acts as of as you
[21:29] would they were doing it sometimes even
[21:31] from house to house when you read Acts
[21:33] chapter
[21:36] 2 praise the name of our Lord when never
[21:39] they had a
[21:40] service and we need also to observe
[21:42] these
[21:43] things because the Lord showed us the
[21:47] example and we need to see that you know
[21:49] when we come for the Lord this
[21:52] supper we come waiting on the
[21:54] Lord and during that time of the Lord is
[21:57] supper
[21:59] we also observe the foot
[22:03] washing praise the name of the Lord
[22:05] washing one another's
[22:07] feet being concerned about the other
[22:11] brother praise the name of our Lord not
[22:14] being like
[22:15] C am I My Brother's
[22:18] Keeper praise the name of the Lord so
[22:21] again I want to on two weeks from
[22:25] now that will be on on 14th of
[22:31] January we are going to host Pastor mang
[22:35] from

[22:40] services on that
[22:43] Sunday I would still call upon your

[22:50] a meal together with all the people we
[22:52] shall invite to come here for that
[22:55] day and then in February also

[23:02] February 11th of
[23:05] February shall have brother from Poland
[23:07] also coming to minister us for two
[23:11] services so let us be involved in the
[23:14] kingdom of
[23:15] God don't be weary in good
[23:19] doing praise the name of our Lord don't
[23:22] be
[23:23] tired praise the name of the Lord you
[23:26] know you can buy something with a lot of
[23:29] money and it vanishes
[23:32] immediately but what you put in the
[23:34] Kingdom lasts
[23:36] forever praise the name of the Lord
[23:39] putting your
[23:41] time putting your
[23:44] energy putting your
[23:46] resources all these things will count at
[23:49] the end of the
[23:51] day praise the name of the Lord what we
[23:53] do on Earth will stop here on
[23:55] Earth and they are temporary but what we
[23:58] do for the
[24:00] kingdom is eternal and so we need to see
[24:03] that we learn how to be part of the
[24:06] building of the kingdom of
[24:09] God praise the name of our
[24:12] Lord now we want to thank God who gave
[24:17] Brother Joseph and our sister
[24:21] Patricia this
[24:25] week I'm not seeing them around
[24:28] but we thank God for the grace that he
[24:29] has given
[24:31] them amen now let us stand up and go to
[24:34] our scripture
[24:36] reading we are going to John chapter
[24:42] 17 and then we are reading in verse 20
[24:46] to verse
[24:49] 24 praise the name of the
[24:56] Lord
[24:59] John 17 verse 20 verse
[25:05] 24 neither pray I for these alone but
[25:09] for them also which Shall Believe on me
[25:13] through
[25:21] their that they all may be one as th
[25:25] father art in me and I in thee
[25:28] that they also may be one in us that the
[25:31] world may believe that thou Hast sent
[25:36] [Music]
[25:48] me and the glory which th Gest me have
[25:51] given them that they may be one even as
[25:54] We Are
[25:56] One
[26:06] i in them and thou in me that they may
[26:08] be made perfect in one and that the
[26:11] world may know that thou Hast sent me
[26:14] and Hast loved them as though Hast loved
[26:26] me
[26:32] father I will that they also whom thou
[26:35] Hast given me be with me where I am that
[26:38] they may behold my glory which thou Hast
[26:42] given me for thou L me before the
[26:44] foundation of the
[26:49] [Music]
[26:56] world
[27:04] again Lord we thank you for the reading
[27:07] of the
[27:08] word the scripture says no scripture is
[27:11] of private
[27:14] interpretation it was given by the
[27:16] inspiration of the Holy
[27:19] Spirit and we pray the same Holy
[27:22] Spirit Come and speak to us the word of
[27:26] life meeting our needs father you help
[27:30] us to be ready for the rapt that at
[27:32] time in the name of the Lord
[27:36] Jesus amen you may be
[27:39] seated
[27:43] amen so
[27:46] today praise the name of our Lord our
[27:49] brother cus
[27:52] mang is becoming our TR interpreter for
[27:55] the main services
[28:00] praise the name of the Lord I remember
[28:03] brother Jeremiah also started like
[28:06] this when brother was
[28:10] off so brother
[28:13] Jeremiah started the church
[28:17] at and we officially released
[28:22] him so today that's the first day also
[28:25] is starting to hold this service is
[28:27] there
[28:30] fully so just keep him
[28:33] praying praise the name of our Lord I
[28:36] was telling
[28:38] C that you know you need to
[28:41] stand praise the name of the Lord you
[28:44] know not hiding
[28:47] somewhere but just need to come
[28:49] out praise the name of our Lord and we
[28:53] pray that God gives us the grace
[28:55] also to ident identify other
[28:59] gifts praise the name of the Lord that
[29:02] the work may keep on
[29:04] growing I was telling brother cus
[29:08] about about I think about 6 months
[29:12] ago when there was a
[29:15] need and then I told
[29:17] him one thing which happens
[29:20] here any person who comes and stands
[29:23] here either
[29:25] translator or leader they end up
[29:29] becoming
[29:30] pastors praise the name of our Lord so
[29:34] then when you come
[29:36] here come here ready to know that soon
[29:39] you will be a
[29:44] pastor praise the name of our Lord and
[29:47] so
[29:49] likewise when you start standing
[29:53] here you need to make
[29:56] sure that you meet the qualification of
[29:59] being a pastor in your
[30:03] lifetime but sometimes issues of
[30:06] marriage distort
[30:11] that praise the name of the Lord we
[30:14] always tell
[30:15] them you've started this
[30:18] line look
[30:20] forward let your
[30:22] marriage not put you out out of the
[30:26] service
[30:27] praise the name of the Lord so just keep
[30:30] on praying for brother
[30:32] cus praise the name of the Lord so this
[30:35] morning I want to preach on the
[30:38] subject being one with
[30:41] God being one with
[30:45] God praise the name of our Lord being
[30:48] one with
[30:50] God and then we see our Lord Jesus
[30:54] Christ when he was praying
[30:58] he says in verse
[31:00] 21 that they all may be
[31:04] one as though
[31:06] father in me and I in thee that they
[31:13] also may be one in
[31:16] us that the world may believe that thou
[31:19] Hast sent
[31:22] me so we we
[31:26] God desire us to be one with
[31:31] him you know like Christ was one with
[31:35] the
[31:36] Father the father was in
[31:39] him and he was also in the
[31:43] father praise the name of our Lord and
[31:46] God desires that
[31:49] Harmony you know to be to continue in
[31:54] Us Praise the name of our Lord God
[31:57] desires that
[31:59] Harmony you know that it may continue in
[32:04] US it shouldn't
[32:06] stop praise the name of our Lord and
[32:09] then you when you read in the message
[32:11] Christ is the mystery of God
[32:15] revealed praise the name of our Lord and
[32:18] then our Prophet says that God had a
[32:23] threefold
[32:26] purpose praise the name of our Lord and
[32:29] now the first
[32:31] purpose led into the second
[32:34] purpose and then the second purpose led
[32:38] into the third
[32:40] purpose I just want to get it here see
[32:43] if I can read
[32:45] it praise the name of our Lord and so
[32:48] but when you look at all these three
[32:51] fold
[32:53] purposes at the end of the
[32:56] day it would make us strive this thought
[33:00] we have
[33:02] today being one with
[33:06] God praise the name of our Lord so our
[33:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[33:10] say as I am in
[33:13] you and you in
[33:15] me now when we read in John 17 verse
[33:21] 23 he said I in
[33:25] them
[33:28] and though in
[33:30] me that they may be made perfect in
[33:36] one praise the name of our Lord and
[33:39] that's the intent of
[33:41] God that we can be one with
[33:46] God praise the name of our Lord and if
[33:49] we are saying that we are one with
[33:52] God we also need to be one with one
[33:55] another
[33:58] in verse 22 it says and the glory which
[34:01] thou Gest me have I given them that they
[34:04] may be one even as we are
[34:12] one so you see how the Lord desires
[34:17] us that we may be
[34:20] one praise the name of of our and you
[34:23] know God has given us various examples
[34:28] where Oneness can be
[34:31] made the first
[34:33] example a wife and the
[34:36] husband they become one but yet these
[34:40] are
[34:41] individuals but yet their heart have to
[34:44] be NE
[34:46] together praise the name of our Lord
[34:49] their heart have to be KN
[34:51] together their feelings have to be
[34:54] one their understanding have to be
[34:57] one their dwelling place has to be
[35:00] one praise the name of the Lord you know
[35:03] there are some people who marry and put
[35:05] their wives in The
[35:07] Villages and then for him is in town
[35:10] then you ask him why did you marry her
[35:13] she's meant to be where you
[35:14] are but says are you going to be with my
[35:17] parents while for me for him is the
[35:19] other side that's not it when God called
[35:24] Abraham brother Bram says when calls a
[35:27] man he calls him with his wife so
[35:31] Abraham didn't leave Sarah and sah let
[35:34] me go this way they had to go
[35:36] together
[35:38] Oneness praise the name of our Lord you
[35:41] look at even this
[35:44] sports
[35:45] sports you know like football you know
[35:49] it has 11
[35:51] players and those players are trained to
[35:53] be
[35:55] one they are trained to have the same
[36:00] mind they are training to
[36:03] coordinate and the goalkeeper is
[36:07] trained that anything he
[36:10] does is saving the whole team and the
[36:13] whole
[36:15] club but if the goalkeeper doesn't
[36:20] care the whole team loses it doesn't
[36:24] matter how much they are striving
[36:28] if he
[36:30] careless and you know the way they
[36:33] say that the strength the strength of a
[36:39] chain is at its weakest
[36:42] point so the weakest
[36:45] Point illustrates the strength of the
[36:48] chain it may be heard
[36:50] everywhere but if it gets only one
[36:54] point and it can break
[36:57] then it is
[36:59] weak and you know one thing which is
[37:02] weak is
[37:06] water you know it just disintegrates
[37:11] anywhere you know and then Jacob was
[37:14] telling his son
[37:17] Reuben as
[37:19] weak as
[37:21] water praise the name of our Lord now
[37:25] Oneness
[37:27] God wants us to be
[37:30] one as a family you need to be
[37:34] one the husband and the
[37:37] wife have the same
[37:40] mind the
[37:42] parents bring your children to
[37:44] appreciate your
[37:46] mind and let your children grow up in
[37:49] that
[37:51] mind and even now here also as a church
[37:55] we need also to be be
[37:57] one praise the name of the Lord we need
[38:00] to be one we need to be take interest in
[38:03] the activities of the
[38:06] church praise the name of our Lord I
[38:09] would give maybe
[38:10] examples if we are as a church we have
[38:14] an activity we have said we are going to
[38:17] do and then for you say I have also
[38:20] M you're not demonstrating that
[38:23] Oneness praise the name of our Lord we
[38:26] say maybe we are going to have visiting
[38:29] Minister come and let us support that
[38:32] meeting together as
[38:35] one it will be like a
[38:37] family maybe in a family there's an
[38:40] introduction or there is a wedding and
[38:43] you as a family
[38:45] member say that time I have also a
[38:50] trip how does it look like in the
[38:53] family your brother is going to wait or
[38:56] your sister is going to
[38:58] introduce and then you say me I'll be
[39:00] going for a trip
[39:02] somewhere there's something wrong in
[39:04] that kind of so even us as
[39:08] church we need also to be
[39:11] one prise the name of our Lord avoiding
[39:14] the things that divide
[39:17] us avoiding the things that hurt us as a
[39:22] body praise the name of the Lord like
[39:25] the Bible says the body is
[39:27] one but there are so many members of the
[39:32] body there is the eye there is the mouth
[39:36] there is the neck and then the legs and
[39:41] the hands and if any body suffers
[39:46] pain the whole body feels
[39:50] it the whole body is
[39:53] concerned and this is what the body of
[39:56] Jesus Christ
[39:58] should we need to be
[40:00] concerned if one member is
[40:03] sick concerned about that member if one
[40:07] member has a
[40:09] need be concerned about that member if
[40:12] one member is failing be concerned about
[40:16] that member if one member has a kind of
[40:21] distress come and stand together with
[40:24] that one
[40:25] member in prayer in encouragement in
[40:29] support in whatever kind of thing it
[40:32] is praise the name of you know you're
[40:36] not going to go to the rupture
[40:38] alone it's the body that's going to be
[40:41] ruptured praise the name of our Lord so
[40:44] we need to be concerned about one
[40:47] another praise the name of our Lord so
[40:50] now in the message Christ is the mystery
[40:52] of God
[40:54] revealed he says
[40:59] we want to find out what is the
[41:01] three-fold
[41:04] purpose the first thing was that God
[41:07] wanted to reveal himself to the
[41:12] people he couldn't do it as a great
[41:15] Jehovah
[41:18] God who covered all
[41:22] space Time and
[41:25] Eternity could not he's too great to
[41:29] ever be revealed to the
[41:37] people it could be too
[41:43] mysterious he wanted to express
[41:48] himself
[41:50] iying
[41:53] himself with human beings
[41:57] to reveal himself in
[42:00] Christ now you see the purpose of the
[42:04] Lord he wanted to reveal himself to the
[42:08] people but he so
[42:11] great praise the name of the Lord you
[42:14] know when you think about the greatness
[42:16] of
[42:17] God it is so
[42:20] amazing praise the name of our Lord you
[42:23] know like yesterday this this weekend
[42:25] have been trouble
[42:28] and even most of this month of December
[42:30] I've been traveling to many
[42:32] places and then you go to a certain
[42:35] place and then you look at how people
[42:38] have developed it so how beautiful is
[42:41] this place and then you see how people
[42:44] have worked on it to improve it and you
[42:48] know some places are high others are
[42:51] down others are
[42:53] playing and then you start admiring such
[42:57] places and then what comes to my
[43:00] mind this point
[43:03] here is part of the earth even where I
[43:08] live is part of the
[43:11] earth praise the name of the Lord so
[43:13] then you start wondering what's now the
[43:16] difference it's the same
[43:18] as praise the name of our Lord and then
[43:21] you see you go to other places or you
[43:23] hear some other places
[43:27] but it is the same
[43:29] God who has made
[43:33] them and has also made this
[43:36] place so what the difference I need to
[43:39] thank God for where he has put
[43:42] me praise the name of our Lord and then
[43:44] you say Lord I Thank you and then you
[43:47] know that your
[43:49] place without your
[43:51] place the Earth cannot be
[43:54] complete praise the name of God has made
[43:58] it so then you just be happy for where
[44:01] God has placed
[44:03] you but now you look at this God said
[44:07] the
[44:08] earth and the fullness
[44:11] thereof is
[44:13] mine the Heaven and the fullness
[44:18] thereof but then he humbles
[44:21] himself and then he comes to you and
[44:25] then he says I want want to be in your
[44:27] heart I want to live in your heart you
[44:31] just imagine the crate of the heavens
[44:33] and the
[44:34] Earth coming down to your
[44:37] level praise the name of our Lord and
[44:40] this is what God was doing he humbled
[44:44] himself and then he was born of a
[44:49] woman yet is the creator of the heavens
[44:51] and
[44:53] earth but he humbled himself
[44:56] he became a
[44:58] baby praise the name of our Lord Jesus
[45:01] crying in the hands of
[45:04] Mary praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:07] learning how to
[45:11] talk Jesus learning how to
[45:15] walk how you can you imagine that how
[45:18] the Lord humbled
[45:20] himself let us go to Isaiah chapter
[45:24] 9 praise the name of
[45:27] Isaiah 9 and
[45:35] verse you see prophecy is a very
[45:38] interesting
[45:40] thing in verse six he
[45:42] says For unto us a child is
[45:48] born now you see a prophet he was seeing
[45:52] a
[45:53] vision and then he saw Mary
[45:57] giving birth to a
[45:58] child a child is
[46:01] born but you know you don't know the
[46:03] child is a male or a
[46:05] female and then if afterwards SE his a
[46:10] son so the prophecy or the vision it was
[46:18] Progressive revealing more of what it
[46:23] is a
[46:24] child it is a
[46:27] son and then he saw the
[46:30] son he saw the son growing up and then
[46:34] he says this son here the government is
[46:37] on his
[46:39] shoulders and then he kept on watching
[46:42] and say his name is called
[46:45] wonderful not only wonderful but
[46:49] counselor then says Ah again this child
[46:52] who has been born who is the son
[46:56] he's the Mighty
[46:58] God you know it kept on
[47:01] progressing the Mighty God Everlasting
[47:06] father praise the name of our you see
[47:09] how God humbled
[47:11] himself he came down to our
[47:15] level to be born the way we are born the
[47:19] name of the Lord that should always
[47:21] encourage you and you need to love the
[47:25] Lord much
[47:26] he came down to our
[47:28] levels and then brother Bram says he was
[47:31] too
[47:33] mysterious that he wouldn't reveal
[47:36] himself in that kind of Glory he was
[47:41] in so he
[47:44] condescended and he became a
[47:48] son he was born he was born in our
[47:53] B praise the name of our Lord now when
[47:56] he was born in our
[47:58] midst then we could be able to
[48:01] understand him we could be able to
[48:04] believe him we could be able to accept
[48:07] him and say Lord Jesus come in my life
[48:11] come and take over all my weaknesses
[48:13] come and take over all my
[48:15] failures praise the name of our Lord so
[48:18] in that message Christ the Myster of God
[48:21] revealed he says the first thing that
[48:25] God wanted reveal himself to the
[48:29] people he couldn't do it as a great
[48:33] Jehovah who covered all the
[48:36] space Time and
[48:38] Eternity he could not he too great to
[48:42] ever be revealed to the
[48:46] people because it would be too
[48:50] mysterious he wanted to express
[48:54] himself Iden himself with human
[48:58] beings reveal himself in
[49:01] Christ then secondly to have preeminence
[49:05] in his body of
[49:09] Believers that is his
[49:12] bright that he might live in the
[49:17] people then he says first reveal himself
[49:21] in
[49:22] Christ the fullness of the godhead bodly
[49:26] and then to bring that fullness of
[49:31] godhead Bly into the
[49:34] people that he could have
[49:37] Preen the
[49:40] oversight and the
[49:43] leading thirdly to restore the
[49:47] kingdom to its rightful
[49:51] position that fell by sin by the first
[49:54] Adam
[49:56] back to where he walked in the cool of
[49:59] the
[50:01] evening with his
[50:04] people talked with them fellowed with
[50:07] them so the first
[50:09] purpose revealing himself in
[50:13] Christ God being born in
[50:16] man God as a man and now when we see
[50:20] Christ then Christ dies for our
[50:24] sins accept him as our personal
[50:28] Savior and then you allow him in your
[50:31] life then God could have preeminence in
[50:36] us that we are not our own but we are of
[50:41] God so God coming down in our life and
[50:45] now when God comes down in our life then
[50:48] he restor
[50:51] us to the condition the way it was

[51:08] Oneness the mind of Christ to be in
[51:12] Us Praise the name of our Lord let us go
[51:15] to Philippians chapter
[51:18] 2 and then verse
[51:24] one
[51:29] the scripture
[51:30] says if there be there for any
[51:33] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[51:36] love if any Fellowship of the spirit if
[51:39] any boils of Mercy fulfill ye my joy

[52:51] love being of one Accord
[52:56] being of one
[52:58] mind that's what the scripture is
[53:00] telling us be like
[53:04] minded have that mind of
[53:09] Christ you know we are living in very
[53:11] challenging
[53:13] times and we all go through different
[53:18] travs you find this trouble has come
[53:21] here then you find another trouble has
[53:24] come
[53:25] but you
[53:26] see God wants
[53:30] us to have the same
[53:33] mind praise the name of our Lord he
[53:36] doesn't want
[53:38] us to be
[53:41] [Music]
[53:43] highed
[53:46] highed that's the order of the
[53:48] world but now as children of God he
[53:52] wants us to be
[53:54] likeminded
[53:57] [Music]
[53:58] humility praise the name of the Lord God
[54:02] coming down to Ru in our
[54:05] lives and then saying having one
[54:09] Accord of one
[54:11] mind verse
[54:13] three let nothing be done through Strife
[54:17] of vain
[54:24] Glory in loneliness of Mind Let each
[54:28] esteem the other better than
[54:38] themselves but look at the time time of
[54:46] competition if this one has got this I
[54:49] also need to have this if this one has
[54:51] got this also need to have
[54:53] this but then he said says be of a lonly
[54:59] mind and esteem the other better than
[55:03] yourself if God has blessed the other
[55:06] with
[55:07] something say Lord we thank you for
[55:09] blessing our not again being
[55:13] hurt
[55:15] no you're not of the same
[55:18] mind desire for the other a better thing
[55:21] than
[55:23] yourself and that's what it should
[55:26] Even in our
[55:28] families but you see the husband wants
[55:30] to hurt the
[55:33] wife or the wife wants to have the
[55:36] husband but you if you are a true
[55:40] Christian allow to take that
[55:43] pain praise the name of our Lord allow
[55:46] to take that
[55:49] pain now I just want us to go into some
[55:52] message
[55:54] here
[55:56] Hebrews chapter 7
[56:01] 1 he
[56:03] says verse paragraph
[56:06] 49 it says
[56:08] Abraham he didn't f with
[56:14] lot he said we are
[56:19] brethren we must not a
[56:23] you now you know when the Servants of
[56:26] lot and Abraham were fighting over the
[56:29] land and
[56:32] water and God had given Abraham all the
[56:37] land but now lot followed
[56:40] Abraham and then the Servants of a lot
[56:43] were fighting with the Servants of
[56:46] Abraham and then Abraham knowing that
[56:48] God has given him all
[56:51] things he told lot no you have the
[56:55] Liberty to choose whever you want to
[56:57] choose if you choose
[57:00] West I'll go east if you
[57:04] choose and then brother Bram
[57:07] says Abraham told him we should not
[57:11] you but lift up your
[57:14] head and go anywhere you want to go if
[57:18] you go east I'll go west if you go north
[57:22] I'll go south that is the Christian
[57:33] attitude praise the name of Lord be
[57:38] willing to give the other man the best
[57:41] of the
[57:45] deal the Fest
[57:48] part where everybody is fighting
[57:51] for brother take
[57:53] it
[57:55] praise the name of our Lord now we need
[57:57] to start challenging
[57:59] ourselves because we talking about being
[58:01] one with
[58:02] God can you forit and give it to another
[58:09] person praise the name of our look at
[58:12] those two
[58:14] prostitutes who gave

[59:06] Solomon and then everybody was fighting
[59:08] for the living
[59:10] child but the other woman each woman
[59:12] each woman knew that this is my child
[59:14] the other also this one is not my child
[59:16] but one who had lost was fighting for
[59:18] the
[59:21] living and then someone said you bring
[59:23] the sword
[59:27] now when they were going to divide the
[59:28] living child in the
[59:30] middle the mother said
[59:33] no give that child to the other
[59:36] one true
[59:40] attitude
[59:42] genu and then Solomon
[59:45] knew this is the mother of the the other
[59:48] woman who had

[1:02:30] are going in the
[1:02:31] rupture it is the people who have
[1:02:35] believed the word of God have obeyed the
[1:02:38] word of God and have demonstrated it in
[1:02:40] their
[1:02:41] life who are going in the rupt that's
[1:02:44] how it

[1:03:13] father are
[1:03:14] one praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:03:17] go back to Philippians chapter

[1:03:22] four look not every man on his own
[1:03:26] things but every man also on the things

[1:04:16] don't you be
[1:04:17] concerned I found brother son so not in
[1:04:20] a good

[1:04:24] and then you support another
[1:04:26] brother praise the name of the Lord you
[1:04:28] are looking onto another
[1:04:31] person to see how best you can help
[1:04:35] them praise the name of our Lord like
[1:04:38] brother Bram when he was having one of
[1:04:41] the
[1:04:41] missions and then he was praying for the
[1:04:43] people in the prayer line and then there
[1:04:46] came a blind
[1:04:48] man and then he looked at him he said
[1:04:51] this one is would be like my father
[1:04:56] and then this man didn't have shoes and
[1:04:58] then he tried to take his
[1:05:01] feet see if his shoes can fit
[1:05:04] him he wanted to give him his
[1:05:07] shoes looking on to the other
[1:05:12] person praise the name of the Lord we
[1:05:14] need to be
[1:05:16] concerned about one
[1:05:19] another you need to feel the pain of the

[1:05:29] my brother let me go stand by my
[1:05:32] brother praise the name of our Lord and
[1:05:35] then you know like there are some people
[1:05:36] who have God has opened opportunities
[1:05:38] for
[1:05:40] them praise the name of our Lord that
[1:05:43] you have access to
[1:05:47] things and then you know there's a
[1:05:49] person that is in
[1:05:51] need or maybe you are in maybe in a
[1:05:54] certain position of authority at place
[1:05:56] of
[1:05:57] work and then there are opportunities of
[1:06:01] work and then you know there are people
[1:06:03] who don't have jobs in the
[1:06:06] family there people in church who don't
[1:06:08] have jobs oh you think this thing can
[1:06:12] help why don't you reach out to them and

[1:06:41] better that's having one
[1:06:44] mind praise the name of the Lord you are
[1:06:46] concerned about

[1:06:52] says let this mind be in you which was
[1:06:55] also in
[1:07:01] Christ yes who being in the form of God
[1:07:05] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:07:19] God but made himself of no reputation
[1:07:23] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:07:26] and was made in the likeness of
[1:07:38] men and being formed in a fashion as a
[1:07:41] man he humbled himself and became
[1:07:44] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:07:47] the
[1:07:52] cross
[1:08:02] praise the name of the Lord he humbled
[1:08:06] himself all the glory all the

[1:08:17] parents praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:20] wherever he was he followed and observed
[1:08:24] the word of
[1:08:25] God and this is the same thing we should

[1:08:45] humble let us wait on the
[1:08:47] Lord let us depend upon
[1:08:50] him and then allow God to take over all
[1:08:54] your
[1:08:56] life if God is inside of you allow him
[1:09:00] to have
[1:09:02] preeminence praise the name of our Lord

[1:11:30] word of God in
[1:11:32] you to put on flesh praise the name of
[1:11:36] our Lord now in the seven Church age

[1:12:07] him they are subject to
[1:12:13] him as the members of our bodies are

[1:26:14] go through the market I need to find out
[1:26:17] this one and then it comes ready you go
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:23] not preed at
[1:26:25] all praise the name of our Lord but we
[1:26:28] need to allow God to use
[1:26:31] us we need to allow God to guide
[1:26:34] us because it says it just
[1:26:38] comes but the thing is are we
[1:26:42] ready praise the name of Lord so he says
[1:26:45] the
[1:26:48] harmony he showed he he could do what he
[1:26:51] was only shown by the
[1:26:55] father then he says this harmony is now
[1:26:59] to exist between the groom and his
[1:27:05] bride he shows her his Word of
[1:27:08] Life she receives it she never doubts it
[1:27:14] therefore nothing can harm
[1:27:17] her not even death for if the seed
[1:27:23] planted the water will raise it up
[1:27:26] again here is the secret of
[1:27:29] this the word is in the
[1:27:32] bride as it was in
[1:27:35] marage The Bride has the mind of
[1:27:39] Christ for she knows what he wants to be
[1:27:42] done with the
[1:27:44] word she performs the command of the
[1:27:48] word in his name for she has that than
[1:27:51] the Lord
[1:27:55] then the word is quickened by the
[1:27:59] spirit and it comes to
[1:28:03] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:28:08] watered it comes to full
[1:28:11] Harvest serving its
[1:28:13] purpose those in the
[1:28:16] bride do only his
[1:28:19] will no one can make them do
[1:28:23] otherwise they have th say the Lord or
[1:28:27] they keep
[1:28:32] still they know that it has to be God in
[1:28:35] them doing the
[1:28:38] works fulfilling his
[1:28:41] work he did not complete all his work
[1:28:44] while on
[1:28:46] Earth so now he walks through the
[1:28:49] bright she knows that
[1:28:52] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:28:54] certain
[1:28:57] things that he must now
[1:29:00] do but he will now fulfill through the
[1:29:04] bride that work which was left for a
[1:29:06] specific
[1:29:10] time praise the name of the Lord we need
[1:29:12] to allow God to take
[1:29:15] over spirit of God you know to have the
[1:29:19] same mind of God
[1:29:22] to be one with

[1:29:26] the word you have yielded yourself to
[1:29:29] the word you are not your
[1:29:32] own praise the name of our is Christ in
[1:29:35] you having preeminence in
[1:29:39] you and that's the desire of God that he

[1:31:14] thing I am of my
[1:31:17] own he couldn't receive eternal life he
[1:31:21] wanted to be on his

[1:31:27] work like
[1:31:29] that you have to lose
[1:31:32] one Lose
[1:31:36] Yourself that's what the Bible says
[1:31:40] whoever doesn't lose
[1:31:43] himself will lose himself at end of the
[1:31:47] day whoever denies
[1:31:50] himself
[1:31:54] your
[1:31:57] rights your kind of
[1:32:00] privileges you deny
[1:32:03] yourself he says shall not lose his
[1:32:07] life but if you don't deny yourself for
[1:32:11] the sake of the Gospel you're going to
[1:32:14] lose it the rich didn't want to deny his
[1:32:20] possession to give them out freely and
[1:32:24] say Lord I'm here I want to follow you
[1:32:27] Lord here follow you what did did do he
[1:32:30] lost eternal life and then he was in
[1:32:33] hell and then he was crying oh Father
[1:32:37] Abraham oh Father
[1:32:40] Abraham but it was too late for him and
[1:32:44] he realized in hell that what he worked
[1:32:48] for he lost
[1:32:50] everything he lost
[1:32:52] everything he didn't allow eternal
[1:32:56] life to be part of
[1:32:59] him to kind of do you know to kind of do
[1:33:04] an
[1:33:07] exchange it was an exchange he say okay
[1:33:11] give all that you have come and follow
[1:33:14] me and then I give etern it was hard for
[1:33:18] him but then look at Moses
[1:33:22] Moses was to be the
[1:33:25] next praise the name of Lord Moses was
[1:33:30] the next Pharaoh he was highly trained
[1:33:33] in military
[1:33:35] Andy but then when it came to him that
[1:33:39] you have to be identified with the
[1:33:42] Jews praise the name of the Lord he
[1:33:44] humbled
[1:33:46] himself and we need to Humble
[1:33:49] ourselves for the sake of the Gospel of
[1:33:51] Jesus Christ you forit your
[1:33:55] right you fit your thoughts your
[1:33:59] imagination and say Lord here I
[1:34:02] am look at Christ in the garden of
[1:34:05] Geth not my will but let your will be
[1:34:10] done praise the name of the Lord we need
[1:34:12] to become one with
[1:34:15] God the mind of God to come down and
[1:34:18] take over our
[1:34:20] lives that we are not of our own that's
[1:34:24] what the Bible says we are not of our
[1:34:27] own we are the Sheep of his
[1:34:30] pasture he has made us he has created us
[1:34:35] and he has a purpose for each and every
[1:34:38] one so we yield to him and say Lord here
[1:34:40] I
[1:34:41] am take over all my life as a young
[1:34:46] person let allow God to take over all
[1:34:48] your life as a mature person
[1:34:52] allow God take over all your
[1:34:54] life praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:34:56] go to Hebrews
[1:34:59] 11 and then read about
[1:35:02] Moses he was also a rich
[1:35:05] man Abraham he was also a rich man but
[1:35:09] here Abraham is used to his
[1:35:11] country he has a big
[1:35:15] inheritance then the gospel comes in
[1:35:17] Genesis 12 and verse
[1:35:20] one
[1:35:22] leave your country leave all your
[1:35:25] possessions and come and follow me now
[1:35:28] you can imagine God telling Abraham to
[1:35:32] follow him to a place he didn't
[1:35:34] know but Abraham just
[1:35:37] followed now maybe Abraham was
[1:35:40] leaving they were asking where are you
[1:35:42] going I don't know what are you going to
[1:35:46] do I don't know but he had to obey the
[1:35:49] voice and that's the same with us you
[1:35:53] have to obey the voice of
[1:35:56] God praise the name of our so here the
[1:35:59] Bible says in Hebrews
[1:36:05] 11:3 Hebrews 11 verse 23 rather it
[1:36:11] says by faith Moses when he was born he
[1:36:14] was hid three month of his parents
[1:36:17] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:36:19] and they were not afraid of the King's
[1:36:21] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[1:36:24] come to years refused to be called the
[1:36:27] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:36:29] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[1:36:31] people of God than to enjoy the
[1:36:33] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[1:36:37] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[1:36:39] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:36:42] respect and recompense of the
[1:36:50] reward
[1:37:20] for
[1:37:37] praise the name of the Lord look at the
[1:37:40] Rich Young
[1:37:41] lul and then look at Moses they were all
[1:37:45] subjected to the same
[1:37:49] test Abraham subjected to the simp and
[1:37:53] we are also subjected to the
[1:37:57] simp the gospel comes but then you have
[1:38:01] to choose do I have to live the way of
[1:38:04] the gospel of Christ or have to live the
[1:38:07] way of the way of the
[1:38:09] life the way of the
[1:38:12] world praise the name of our Lord Moses
[1:38:16] with a great
[1:38:17] Glory you know what was ahead of him
[1:38:21] all promising
[1:38:23] career going to take over the whole
[1:38:26] world but he humbled himself and he went
[1:38:30] and identified
[1:38:32] himself with the Leist of the
[1:38:35] people the
[1:38:39] slaves
[1:38:41] slavy can you imagine that you're going
[1:38:45] to be the next leader and you go to the
[1:38:48] Le of the
[1:38:50] people
[1:38:52] the Bible says he esed the reproach of
[1:38:56] Christ to be greater
[1:38:59] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[1:39:03] he had respect unto the recompose of the
[1:39:08] reward he was looking at something
[1:39:12] Eternal praise the name of our Lord he
[1:39:15] was seeing something
[1:39:17] invisible and that should be the same
[1:39:19] thing with us the promise of God ahead
[1:39:22] of us the change of our bodies should be
[1:39:26] something that excites
[1:39:29] you now you look in the Natural
[1:39:32] Life a person will even sell his
[1:39:36] land everything he has for the sake of
[1:39:40] his life or his health but then here God
[1:39:44] has promised
[1:39:46] us that is going to give us a new body
[1:39:51] God has promised us that we are not
[1:39:54] going to see
[1:39:55] death God has promised us that we are
[1:39:59] going to live as youth
[1:40:02] forever but what he wants to do make the
[1:40:07] choice praise the name of make the
[1:40:10] choice he says great thingsit
[1:40:15] us so you must make a
[1:40:18] decision praise the name of our Lord
[1:40:22] now in the
[1:40:24] message a
[1:40:26] prisoner he
[1:40:28] says but before I say about
[1:40:32] Moses I would like to make this
[1:40:35] statement that
[1:40:37] God
[1:40:39] always has to take any
[1:40:43] man that will serve him
[1:40:47] truly to be his prisoner

[1:52:57] city and appeared to
[1:53:01] many then he
[1:53:03] says there is that
[1:53:08] elected not all the Jewish Church came
[1:53:11] forth at that
[1:53:14] time all of them made the same
[1:53:18] sacrifice all of
[1:53:21] them was under the shed blood of the
[1:53:25] lamb but there was but there was an
[1:53:28] elected
[1:53:31] group and that elected
[1:53:33] group as soon as the event
[1:53:37] came that really believed in it with
[1:53:44] sincerity praise the name of it says now
[1:53:47] I'm coming to the to the word of
[1:53:52] now hold
[1:53:53] that that really
[1:53:57] overcame sincerely making the same
[1:54:01] offering the rest of them
[1:54:07] made but
[1:54:10] sincerity overcame the things of the
[1:54:14] world this is now the same challenge we
[1:54:18] have all of us
[1:54:20] belies but then who is taking the word
[1:54:22] of God to be
[1:54:25] serious he says in the Old Testament
[1:54:28] they had the same
[1:54:30] lamb they had the same
[1:54:32] sacrifices they had the same
[1:54:35] opportunities but then who were taken up
[1:54:38] in the
[1:54:39] rupture are those who were living the
[1:54:43] life of what was
[1:54:46] taught of what was given the same thing
[1:54:49] with that
[1:54:51] if brother Bram
[1:54:54] says that if I arue with my
[1:54:58] brother and after arguing with
[1:55:01] him I have a bad feeling about
[1:55:05] him I need to come to the
[1:55:08] altar how about
[1:55:10] us praise the name of the Lord some can
[1:55:14] live a
[1:55:16] life of
[1:55:18] hating
[1:55:20] year one hating year two ha it's a of
[1:55:25] life there's no rupture for
[1:55:28] you praise the name of our Lord some can
[1:55:32] be in a
[1:55:34] mistake or an
[1:55:36] error or something wrong and they want
[1:55:39] Rejoice continuously doing
[1:55:41] it there's no rupture
[1:55:43] there praise the name of the Lord you
[1:55:46] are in something wrong and you continue
[1:55:49] being
[1:55:50] something why don't you come out of
[1:55:53] it praise the name of the Lord the Bible
[1:55:56] says righteous man falls seven times
[1:56:01] a but when he falls he rises up for you
[1:56:05] while are you failing to rise out of
[1:56:09] your why are you rejoicing in your
[1:56:12] mistakes why are you comfortable in
[1:56:15] living evil
[1:56:17] way why don't you come out of of that
[1:56:21] situation praise the name of the Lord we
[1:56:24] have a rupture in our
[1:56:26] generation but how will it find
[1:56:30] you praise the name of the Lord Brother
[1:56:32] Bram says when he went beyond the
[1:56:34] curtain of
[1:56:36] time he says it will take perfect
[1:56:41] love now is our perfect
[1:56:43] love that's the question we need to ask
[1:56:46] ourselves let us not be like the was of
[1:56:49] the
[1:56:51] let us be
[1:56:53] serious what we have
[1:56:55] believed praise the name of let us be
[1:56:58] serious he said there were many in the
[1:57:01] Old
[1:57:02] Testament there were the Jewish
[1:57:04] Church look at the children of Israel
[1:57:08] many two millions left
[1:57:10] Egypt but of the two millions that came
[1:57:13] out of
[1:57:14] Egypt only
[1:57:17] two Joshua and Cal
[1:57:20] entered the promised land but yet they
[1:57:22] left Egypt to enter the promised
[1:57:25] land but many of them God was not
[1:57:30] pleased with
[1:57:31] them how about us the one tells us to do
[1:57:34] this and we don't care about it and this
[1:57:38] is what we are finding in many
[1:57:42] people praise the name of Lord not only
[1:57:45] here but is something all over
[1:57:48] everywhere gross
[1:57:51] Darkness First Love Has Gone the desire
[1:57:55] of God has gone
[1:57:57] away but yet it is the
[1:58:00] time where the Bible says blessed is
[1:58:04] that
[1:58:04] [Music]
