[27:01] one but before we do
[27:04] pray let's talk to the author of the
[27:09] word precious Heavenly
[27:12] Father we are thankful
[27:14] people that we've been able to come
[27:17] before your
[27:18] presence and have fellowship with
[27:21] you that's the principal reason why were
[27:26] created to have
[27:29] fellowship and Lord you have made access
[27:32] for
[27:33] us to come into the Holiness by the
[27:35] blood of
[27:38] Jesus that we may find Salvation in
[27:42] times of
[27:44] need so we pray Lord that you may come
[27:48] down and father speak to
[27:51] us from your word and Lord when you
[27:56] speak we pray that may also water it
[27:59] with the spirit of
[28:01] life that the word may bear fruit in our
[28:06] lives I commit you all these your
[28:10] children that are present this
[28:13] morning that father you grant
[28:16] them the desires of their
[28:19] hearts meet their need
[28:21] father in Jesus name amen Romans chapter
[28:26] 1
[28:28] and verse
[28:30] one
[28:32] Paul a servant of Jesus
[28:35] Christ called to be an
[28:39] apostle separated unto the gospel of
[28:45] God
[28:48] what an
[28:52] identification amen says I'm a servant
[28:56] of Jesus Christ
[28:58] are we all Servants of Jesus
[29:01] Christ but then Paul says he was called
[29:05] to be an
[29:07] apostle what are you called to
[29:11] be he knew
[29:13] himself what were you called to
[29:17] be that we may
[29:20] know the mystery of his
[29:23] will may God bless the reading of the
[29:26] word and we may be SE
[29:32] so
[29:33] today I'm just going to start on a few
[29:38] [Music]
[29:39] series and I'm going to call this series
[29:42] preaching
[29:46] stability preaching
[29:49] stability you see when we were
[29:52] called we were called at
[29:55] rest but sometimes when people find
[29:59] Christ they become so
[30:03] unsettled because they think they are
[30:06] the ones who are going to work it
[30:09] out but you know I want to take some
[30:13] series and preach
[30:18] stability so that you can come to the
[30:22] church and just come to
[30:25] celebrate and thank God for Redemption
[30:29] the salvation of your
[30:31] soul God fulfilling his
[30:35] promises that's what we are here
[30:38] for now
[30:40] Christ is that eternal
[30:44] spirit amen but you know uh before the
[30:50] foundation of the
[30:53] world that eternal spirit
[30:58] existed
[30:59] alone he had no you know star no
[31:05] moon no atom no
[31:09] guns this eternal spirit was by
[31:13] himself and the Hebrews called him
[31:18] Elohim the one who exist who exists
[31:22] alone so now he
[31:26] condescended when he came to the time of
[31:30] creation he left the
[31:33] form where he was as
[31:36] Elohim and come into a lower
[31:40] form but he was still the same
[31:43] God same power same
[31:47] Authority and then we understood him as
[31:51] logos because he was going to
[31:54] create and he needed to speak the word
[31:59] and then that same one here is the one
[32:02] that was that Pillar of
[32:04] Fire the Fountain of
[32:07] Life everything that
[32:10] exists came from that
[32:13] Fountain so we understand that the
[32:17] worlds were framed by the word of
[32:21] God the power of the
[32:23] word and as sons of
[32:26] God we or from that Eternal
[32:31] Gene amen which is called
[32:34] Christ that's where we originate
[32:37] from that's what makes you an eternal
[32:41] son I mean an eternal child of
[32:44] God you know because you were with
[32:47] him from before the foundation of the
[32:51] world Amen so where did you come from
[32:56] you came from Christ
[32:58] that
[32:59] anointing that Eternal
[33:02] Fountain amen so we are
[33:06] Eternal and we are not products of
[33:11] time amen like C was we are not like Kan
[33:16] you know you know a product of fleshly
[33:21] Union there is a part of
[33:24] me that existed in the original creation
[33:30] amen so in Christ we are as
[33:35] Eternal as Christ is
[33:38] eternal because a man that's born of
[33:42] Christ must be born from
[33:45] above amen so all the
[33:49] elects amen from
[33:53] time back into
[33:55] eternity when we are put together
[33:59] we make the body of that Christ so in
[34:03] our various Natures in
[34:06] Christ we make the Eternal character of
[34:11] God are you together with me yeah we
[34:15] come from God Amen right from
[34:21] Abel all of those after the last elected
[34:26] one make one
[34:28] body and every one of those has been a
[34:32] special
[34:34] character that come from God and that
[34:37] special character cannot be
[34:41] replicated amen everybody is an original
[34:47] character amen you may get a thousand
[34:51] pastors and you put them there but they
[34:55] are not the same everybody is different
[34:59] that's what makes God
[35:02] special amen different
[35:05] characters right from Abel to the last
[35:08] elected one
[35:11] everybody is going to be an original
[35:16] product and until all the character of
[35:21] God has been produced here on
[35:24] Earth to be tested
[35:27] then
[35:28] overcome there cannot be a
[35:31] Rapture are you together with me so some
[35:36] Apostles some are prophets some are
[35:40] evangelist some are pastors some are
[35:44] teachers some do
[35:47] exaltation some they do giving some are
[35:52] business some are
[35:54] mechanics some are
[35:56] Housewives some engineers
[35:59] in different
[36:00] callings but everyone is unique from one
[36:05] another that's how rich God
[36:08] is amen I'll will show you the wealth of
[36:12] God look at
[36:16] vegetation amen when you get out into
[36:19] the
[36:20] wild there are thousands and
[36:23] thousands of different designs
[36:28] amen of
[36:30] vegetation you get
[36:32] mang you get oranges you get tangel you
[36:37] get different
[36:39] avocados you know all kinds of
[36:41] things but all these look
[36:45] different in
[36:47] thousands and yet all of those if their
[36:51] are fruits they taste
[36:54] different and all those every one of
[36:57] them is different from
[37:00] another by the quality of food that they
[37:06] carry some of this
[37:08] vitamin some of
[37:11] this you know God is so
[37:14] rich amen is Rich of
[37:18] design we are billions of people here on
[37:22] Earth but
[37:24] none existing on the Earth today
[37:28] looks like the other that's a wonderful
[37:33] artist are you together with all of us
[37:36] when we apply our thumb
[37:39] print we exactly different even what you
[37:43] think identical
[37:45] twins they are not the
[37:48] same it's your eyes which think we are
[37:51] the
[37:52] same and your eyes may look at
[37:55] us and you think we are the same because
[37:59] we are all
[38:00] pastors no everybody has got a different
[38:05] calling and the way he manifest the
[38:08] gifts God has
[38:10] given Amen brother Bram says it takes
[38:16] God as his Spirit as he promised to move
[38:20] in our
[38:22] bodies as he did in the body of his son
[38:28] amen I'm taking you up 11 now he
[38:32] promised to move in your
[38:34] body the same way moved in the body of
[38:37] his
[38:39] son and we being
[38:42] his become sons of
[38:45] God and a part of that same
[38:48] Spirit are you together with me because
[38:52] Jesus was the
[38:53] fullness and he came in body but we
[38:58] we receive of the
[39:00] fullness but still coming in a body are
[39:04] you together with me yes sir and he says
[39:07] when you
[39:08] receive of that fullness then God begins
[39:12] to
[39:13] move in your body the same way moved in
[39:17] the body of the Lord Jesus
[39:19] Christ then he says the
[39:22] character The
[39:24] Works manifest the same thing
[39:28] as it did when it was in the Corporal
[39:31] body of our blessed
[39:35] savior together with me so we are all
[39:39] called
[39:41] differently but whichever call we are
[39:44] called
[39:46] into we are a part of that great
[39:50] body and that's what brings the
[39:54] stability if we are part of that same
[39:58] we got the example of our own
[40:01] bodies a
[40:03] finger will never wake up one
[40:06] morning complaining why it's not the
[40:10] feet why am I not the
[40:13] toes amen the body is always in a
[40:18] Harmony if we come by that same
[40:22] Spirit then we come from a body and we
[40:26] are part of the body body that's where
[40:29] the unity of the body comes from if you
[40:32] came from the
[40:33] father because elect cannot fight
[40:38] elect amen he says Paul a servant of
[40:42] Jesus
[40:44] Christ called to
[40:47] be an
[40:49] apostle are you together with me I don't
[40:52] know what you are called to
[40:54] be but God has invested in everything
[40:58] one a specific
[41:01] calling that can never be
[41:04] duplicated called to
[41:07] be Paul knew who he was in the body of
[41:11] Christ and that's your
[41:14] well amen when you know who you are in
[41:18] the body of Christ I'll take you to the
[41:21] Book of
[41:23] Exodus amen chapter 31
[41:27] and then verse two
[41:29] here it says see I have all I have
[41:33] called by name bzar the son of
[41:41] Yuri the son
[41:44] of of the tribe of
[41:46] Judah so I have called by
[41:53] name now we already know that a
[41:59] name has to do with
[42:03] disposition you know disposition is the
[42:09] nature the name always speaks about your
[42:14] nature so he's telling
[42:18] Moses I have
[42:22] called by name
[42:27] amen I have called him by a specific
[42:33] gift he not going to be a
[42:36] Moses is not going to be
[42:39] Anon is not going to be maybe
[42:43] Miriam but he has a part in the
[42:46] body are you together with me I have
[42:50] called him by
[42:52] name there is a character I have set in
[42:55] him
[42:57] and that's what is saying or he's
[42:59] calling the
[43:01] name and verse three
[43:04] says
[43:05] listen I have filled him with the spirit
[43:10] of
[43:13] God in
[43:15] wisdom and in understanding and in
[43:18] knowledge and in all man of work
[43:22] command now when you receive the B of
[43:25] the Holy Spirit
[43:28] you have received a particular
[43:32] form of
[43:37] disposition you know a way God wants you
[43:40] to manifest
[43:43] yourself you don't receive the Holy
[43:46] Spirit and you become
[43:49] Dom when if filled B with the Holy
[43:54] Spirit he begins to explain what that
[43:57] spirit is going to
[44:00] do it will give him
[44:03] understanding and
[44:05] knowledge in all manner of
[44:08] workers now that God has filled me with
[44:11] the Holy
[44:13] Ghost what is the spirit going to do in
[44:17] me that should be the question
[44:20] of Lord help me that you may testify
[44:24] about
[44:25] me like you Tes
[44:28] about I have filled him with the spirit
[44:31] of
[44:32] God in wisdom and
[44:35] understanding and knowledge in all
[44:39] manner of
[44:40] work so I have filled him with the
[44:43] spirit of
[44:45] God to work the
[44:48] gold Amen to craft the
[44:51] gold to craft the
[44:54] silver and once he FS with this
[44:58] spirit that spirit will bring certain
[45:02] abilities that will help in the building
[45:05] of the
[45:07] Tabernacle are you together with me yeah
[45:10] you don't ask for the B of the Holy
[45:14] Spirit just to show you've got
[45:18] power to heal the sick that's the minor
[45:22] thing when we talk about the Holy
[45:25] Spirit because there are those that will
[45:28] use the
[45:29] gift to heal the sick even without the B
[45:34] of the Holy
[45:36] Spirit together with me so now that I
[45:40] have received the Holy
[45:43] Spirit what is your purpose in my
[45:47] life remember TI this
[45:50] morning is preaching
[45:54] stability part one
[45:57] because when we were called we were
[46:00] called to rest we were not called to
[46:04] panic amen so he says in verse
[46:09] four to devise caring
[46:15] Works to work in
[46:17] gold and in silver and in BR and cutting
[46:22] of
[46:23] stones to set them and cing of
[46:28] Timber work in all man of
[46:31] work I behold I have given
[46:36] him
[46:39] AOL the son
[46:41] of of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts
[46:46] of all that are wise
[46:50] hearted put
[46:52] wisdom that they may make all that I
[46:54] have commanded thee
[46:58] listen now the way God is working here
[47:02] he has called Moses he understand the
[47:07] specifications amen all the
[47:10] entire uh house is in his
[47:14] mind but then God says you are not able
[47:18] to craft these
[47:20] things so you need to find a
[47:24] man and I've called B by
[47:29] name are you together with me
[47:33] so might be a very
[47:36] knowledgeable wise
[47:42] pman but then the
[47:46] specifications is not coming from his
[47:50] mind Moses has the
[47:52] specifications but he cannot work the
[47:55] specifications
[47:57] a can work
[47:59] them but he doesn't know how to do that
[48:02] so he has to stay on the ministry to him
[48:06] to what God wants him to
[48:08] be are you together with me yes sir he
[48:12] says behold I have given with him
[48:18] a a is also
[48:21] called to work the gold and the
[48:25] silver but then is now God is setting
[48:31] ranks he makes
[48:33] B the head
[48:37] and is a
[48:39] helper amen but all of them are needed
[48:42] to do the
[48:44] work so we being
[48:47] many we are one body in
[48:50] Christ and every
[48:52] one member of One or to another
[48:58] are you together with me yeah he says I
[49:00] called a with
[49:03] him so God made it he made it that way
[49:08] so that there cannot be competition in
[49:10] the
[49:12] body are you together with me everybody
[49:15] has got a spot
[49:18] this amen and then begin to
[49:22] operate if this hand grows on the h in
[49:26] the back
[49:28] here then it will have
[49:30] trouble to do its work it could have
[49:35] desire to be the side of
[49:38] the maybe grow from here but that one
[49:42] will deform the
[49:44] body I'm preaching stability this
[49:48] morning amen he says I have called
[49:52] him I have filled him with the spirit of
[49:55] God
[49:56] but then I've have given him
[50:00] a praise the Lord but in the
[50:06] world people go with what earns more
[50:09] [Music]
[50:12] money but in the body of Christ we are
[50:17] positioned to support the
[50:19] body amen and I've told my brother
[50:24] Nelson here
[50:27] that it's important to
[50:31] pray if you don't pray you cannot
[50:34] prosper in your
[50:37] calling amen you might be a
[50:41] Constructor an
[50:43] engineer and Doctor you need the
[50:46] anointing of the holy
[50:49] spirit for you to do your work
[50:52] better amen that's what it is says I
[50:58] have filled him with the spirit of
[51:01] wisdom in doing what in
[51:06] crafting are you together with me so
[51:09] it's very important whatsoever call you
[51:12] find
[51:14] yourself pray that father show me my
[51:19] position give me the grace and the faith
[51:23] to stand in my
[51:25] position you can become the better
[51:28] teacher amen even if you are not a Bible
[51:32] teacher in school you ask for wisdom for
[51:37] God to lift up you you up in your
[51:41] position amen but in the car world oh
[51:45] you know you don't take that
[51:48] c take this one here this one here pays
[51:52] more amen but as a child of God
[51:57] when you find your position that's your
[52:00] joy that's your happiness that's your
[52:04] blessing amen that's why we must be
[52:08] faithful in the house of
[52:10] God faithful as a
[52:13] technician faithful as a
[52:16] teacher amen you know because God will
[52:19] open up appropriate
[52:23] doors to bless you in the area where he
[52:26] has
[52:29] do what you do as unto the Lord use your
[52:34] gift
[52:35] Faithfully so that you can also have the
[52:38] ability to win men un
[52:42] Christ that whatever comes to your
[52:46] work and sees what you have done oh he's
[52:50] going to thank God this is a very
[52:53] wonderful
[52:54] man you know he want to come to church
[52:58] and see where do these people come
[53:00] from amen you are sent there as an
[53:13] attraction misus their
[53:15] gifts Desiring to remove Moses from the
[53:20] office amen so but you know God told
[53:28] my
[53:30] Moses is not
[53:33] so is
[53:36] faithful in all my
[53:39] house in my
[53:41] house you know he says you know
[53:46] Moses I speak to him Li
[53:50] ear as a Ser as a
[53:53] prophet is more than
[53:57] what you people can
[54:02] judge amen said my
[54:08] Moses is faithful in all my
[54:11] house because he knew how to use his
[54:15] gift to benefit the entire
[54:19] body he is faithful in all his
[54:24] house are you Faithful
[54:27] as handling your
[54:29] calling in the house of
[54:34] God if we were
[54:36] faithful and we knew what we were doing
[54:40] we would not go
[54:41] outside to SCE people to do our
[54:46] works because we've got men that have
[54:49] been baptized with the Holy
[54:52] Ghost are you together with me in wisdom
[54:57] to do certain
[55:02] things so we originate from eternity in
[55:06] our
[55:09] Seasons to
[55:11] OCC and use our positions in the
[55:15] body we are part of
[55:19] Eternity and each time an elect comes to
[55:22] his
[55:24] adoption it's ET rolling into
[55:30] time amen because you come here to
[55:35] fulfill a
[55:37] purpose amen there is a purpose for
[55:41] every SE gen of
[55:44] God which comes from above maybe God you
[55:49] know manifested
[55:52] you in this season because you are a
[55:55] prayer
[55:58] he knew the hard time that was going to
[56:00] come
[56:01] chch and sometimes on this very local
[56:06] church and then he manifest you as a man
[56:10] who can manage situations by
[56:16] pray to
[56:18] another maybe God brings you
[56:22] in and then he says you can be anointed
[56:26] to
[56:29] amen and for that one he says you give
[56:33] in
[56:37] simplic you know God knows what he wants
[56:40] to do with
[56:42] us so the seiling of the
[56:47] soul is Sten stepping
[56:53] forth
[56:55] in take his position in the
[57:00] body when the Holy Ghost seals your
[57:05] soul then you are stepping forth in your
[57:10] season to take your position in the
[57:14] body so I would also say like brother
[57:17] Bram
[57:19] says the Royal elected
[57:24] seed are predestinate
[57:27] for of
[57:29] God and the mind of
[57:32] God and His Thoughts then he says in
[57:37] very plain
[57:40] language they were in the mind of God
[57:46] eternally somebody say
[57:49] Amen they are not products of
[57:52] time they were in the mind of God
[57:55] eternally
[57:58] though not
[58:01] expressed until each came
[58:06] forth in the designated DEC
[58:10] season amen you were in the mind of God
[58:15] but you could only be manifested in this
[58:19] season because this is where your
[58:21] calling
[58:22] is it was not in the time of Luther
[58:26] it was not in the time of
[58:28] Wesley neither was it in the time of
[58:31] Moses or Noah
[58:34] this
[58:36] season to manifest the purpose of God
[58:39] for your
[58:41] life and as each member came
[58:45] forth the prophet says it became
[58:50] expressed and took its place in the body
[58:56] amen so they are predestinated in
[59:02] him came from the same source with
[59:06] him it was eternal we are Eternal with
[59:11] him but then in our
[59:14] season we come to manifest
[59:17] God in the many member
[59:20] body every one of you is a part of the
[59:24] body of Christ
[59:28] amen okay now we go down here brother
[59:33] Bram in the saman
[59:37] churches he says now
[59:39] then here we are coming to a
[59:44] conclusion as the Eternal
[59:48] Loos was manifested the
[59:51] Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[59:54] of the godhead bodly
[59:59] and that Eternal one was was the father
[1:00:02] manifest in
[1:00:05] flesh and thereby gain the ti of
[1:00:11] son even we
[1:00:14] also Eternal in his
[1:00:18] thoughts in our
[1:00:20] time became the many membered spoken
[1:00:34] flesh and those Eternal
[1:00:38] thoughts which is you now manifesting
[1:00:42] flesh are the sons of
[1:00:46] God when Jesus was manifesting
[1:00:50] flesh he was showing us the
[1:00:53] father when you are manifest in flesh
[1:00:57] you are trying to show forth
[1:01:00] the
[1:01:03] am even so we are
[1:01:07] so we did not become seed by the
[1:01:11] rebirth we were
[1:01:14] SE and therefore we
[1:01:16] reborn
[1:01:18] only the elect can be
[1:01:22] reborn because you were SE
[1:01:26] is the reason why we could be
[1:01:30] quickened in N Seed there's nothing to
[1:01:35] Quicken are you together with me amen so
[1:01:40] now I want tell
[1:01:42] you you did not become
[1:01:45] SE to be
[1:01:47] saved but you were
[1:01:51] see and that's why you are
[1:01:54] saved so you are
[1:01:57] Eternal with God Amen he that believeth
[1:02:04] me amen and you are the believer because
[1:02:08] you are the Eternal
[1:02:11] SE a portion of
[1:02:14] you is God
[1:02:17] himself amen like he does
[1:02:21] this and so the same potentials
[1:02:26] come down in your
[1:02:27] heart the same poten of this great
[1:02:32] God that's how you are
[1:02:35] Eternal amen because you got those
[1:02:39] Po and you come down
[1:02:42] here to manifest the
[1:02:45] father
[1:02:47] amen only
[1:02:51] himself by his position in the body
[1:02:57] Paul a servant of Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ called to
[1:03:02] be an
[1:03:04] apostle that when the sons of
[1:03:08] God were becoming
[1:03:12] manifest when God spoke
[1:03:16] them into
[1:03:18] creation the person that I
[1:03:21] took was to be an
[1:03:24] apostle that's what
[1:03:28] say so
[1:03:31] Paul a servant of Jesus
[1:03:35] Christ called to be an
[1:03:38] apostle separated under the gospel of
[1:03:42] God understanding of
[1:03:50] himself John the
[1:03:53] Baptist when they went to ask him who he
[1:03:55] was
[1:03:57] he had a clear
[1:03:59] understanding of who he was and he says
[1:04:02] I'm a voice of one crying in the
[1:04:06] wildness I have got news for you every
[1:04:10] one of us has a
[1:04:13] [Applause]
[1:04:15] position has a position in this
[1:04:19] calling he's saying that I am separated
[1:04:22] un the gospel of God
[1:04:26] I cannot be mixed
[1:04:28] up I know where my authority comes
[1:04:34] from I'm not blown by every wind of
[1:04:39] doctr I am separated to the gospel of
[1:04:44] God how many of you would say like
[1:04:47] Paul separated to the
[1:04:50] gospel to listen to the T to read the
[1:04:54] books to
[1:04:57] to pray to have all the attributes of
[1:05:01] God
[1:05:03] manifested to be able to
[1:05:06] love because that's what God is and
[1:05:09] being separated to the attributes of
[1:05:13] God that I can become a body to manifest
[1:05:17] that Eternal
[1:05:19] God Amen I have been given a master seed
[1:05:24] Fai
[1:05:28] amen Master
[1:05:31] seed is the smallest of
[1:05:34] seed it cannot be
[1:05:38] hybrid so you have
[1:05:41] been even that kind of
[1:05:45] Faith to place you in the
[1:05:48] body it cannot be mixed
[1:05:51] up amen he says I am
[1:05:54] called be an apostle I know who I
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:00] am Paul is
[1:06:03] saying my position of
[1:06:06] faith is designed to sustain a gentile
[1:06:15] apostleship amen I cannot go up in the
[1:06:19] calling of
[1:06:21] Peter he was called for the Jews
[1:06:26] but I know my
[1:06:28] position and once every one of us knows
[1:06:33] our position the body that's the
[1:06:35] stability of the
[1:06:39] church
[1:06:41] amen when I
[1:06:44] Paul go
[1:06:47] scripture I only get to see Gentile
[1:06:54] promises I just seem to see
[1:06:57] hey God was hiding them in scripture
[1:07:01] here oh my God they are supposed to be
[1:07:05] part of
[1:07:06] it
[1:07:08] amen yes
[1:07:10] sir but
[1:07:12] Peter was not called for
[1:07:16] that even when celius
[1:07:19] prayed a
[1:07:21] gentile and God sent Peter
[1:07:25] while he was
[1:07:26] speaking the Holy Ghost came down Peter
[1:07:30] still say it's not enough unless you
[1:07:34] wash your feet you wash your P you the
[1:07:39] Jewish you
[1:07:43] know he could not go beyond
[1:07:47] that and when he
[1:07:49] tried he was destabilizing the
[1:07:53] body and says I will him first to
[1:07:59] first as long as you recognize your
[1:08:04] position work in your
[1:08:07] position that's the stability of the
[1:08:11] church so when God calls
[1:08:14] you he releases a position of
[1:08:19] Faith the kind of
[1:08:22] Faith That is supposed to sustain you in
[1:08:26] your
[1:08:28] calling look at Abraham he was called
[1:08:32] into the land of
[1:08:34] promise he was
[1:08:36] anointed and stood up against many
[1:08:41] kings many
[1:08:46] kings that had taken
[1:08:49] lot defeated
[1:08:52] them redeemed lot brought the
[1:08:56] loot but
[1:08:58] then each time he went away from his
[1:09:03] position he was afraid of one
[1:09:10] king he would even tell his
[1:09:13] wife please please you tell these people
[1:09:18] you are my
[1:09:20] sister why he has gone away from his
[1:09:24] position
[1:09:26] he loses the
[1:09:28] authority he loses the power he feels
[1:09:35] vulnerable so perfect way I mean perfect
[1:09:40] Faith Works by seeing your position in
[1:09:43] the
[1:09:45] body recognize your
[1:09:48] position and see how faith and
[1:09:51] Grace and see how faith and Grace
[1:09:56] will pour
[1:09:57] out to support you in that
[1:10:02] position amen is the beginning of all
[1:10:05] form of
[1:10:09] blessing the moment you see your
[1:10:12] position amen you may not have to pray
[1:10:16] for certain
[1:10:18] things God will just bring them to you
[1:10:21] because they are necessary for your
[1:10:22] position
[1:10:26] that's how interesting it is seeking the
[1:10:30] kingdom of
[1:10:31] God and his
[1:10:33] righteousness and everything else will
[1:10:35] be added to
[1:10:37] you you don't need to go and
[1:10:40] fast no when God sees this is necessary
[1:10:44] for his
[1:10:46] position he'll give it to
[1:10:52] you now listen to what says in the
[1:10:56] message hear his
[1:10:58] voice and see how
[1:11:01] God in his great
[1:11:04] plans just know how to make every
[1:11:10] person exactly to be a certain
[1:11:15] thing because he's going to use them for
[1:11:19] that
[1:11:22] purpose hallelujah hallelujah in his
[1:11:25] wisdom he made you what you
[1:11:28] are knowing that he was going to use
[1:11:31] that
[1:11:33] nature the moment it is sealed under the
[1:11:36] holy
[1:11:40] spirit so in every age he releases a
[1:11:44] particular
[1:11:46] Grace for a particular
[1:11:50] area I mean he release a particular
[1:11:54] Grace
[1:11:56] for a particular
[1:12:02] area there is a specific
[1:12:06] Grace for every
[1:12:09] area whether you want it or you don't
[1:12:13] want it not every
[1:12:17] preacher will be successful
[1:12:22] everywhere when you take me to another
[1:12:24] place
[1:12:27] I may not be able to
[1:12:29] perform because the nature of the
[1:12:34] Gen that God gave me was for this
[1:12:41] area and then he says the angel came
[1:12:45] down and told Brother BR if you can get
[1:12:49] the people to believe
[1:12:51] you then nothing will stand against you
[1:12:55] not even
[1:12:57] cancer that's why we
[1:13:00] stand trusting that God has placed us
[1:13:05] here and he gives me the kind of
[1:13:10] approach to the
[1:13:12] word that meets the needs of the
[1:13:16] people that's the way God
[1:13:19] works
[1:13:21] amen he gives a particular Grace
[1:13:26] for a particular
[1:13:28] place he has given us the seeds of our
[1:13:34] people over the Earth we planted this
[1:13:38] seeds and God has blessed the
[1:13:41] people because of the ministry that we
[1:13:44] have rendered out
[1:13:46] here amen he has blessed the
[1:13:50] people some of them have gone beyond
[1:13:53] where they expected
[1:13:58] to but God when he blessed
[1:14:02] Abraham he says I've made you to be a
[1:14:06] blessing when he blessed me He blesses
[1:14:09] me here to be a blessing and he attaches
[1:14:14] you know a certain form of
[1:14:17] seed that I plant among the
[1:14:20] people and then the people begin to
[1:14:23] harvest
[1:14:26] amen they start
[1:14:28] wondering how have we come this
[1:14:31] far how did I overcome this how did I
[1:14:35] overcome that but because a man has been
[1:14:39] given the
[1:14:41] grace he only makes a
[1:14:44] statement and it sticks in the life of
[1:14:47] the
[1:14:48] person it becomes an overcoming
[1:14:52] weapon hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:56] amen he has given us the seeds for our
[1:15:00] people he has been able to keep us
[1:15:04] together he has given us respect for
[1:15:06] each
[1:15:08] other are you together with me I want to
[1:15:12] take the example of the seven
[1:15:15] churches that
[1:15:18] Min
[1:15:20] Ephesus could not take
[1:15:23] over the grace
[1:15:27] the grace
[1:15:28] of and be blessed by
[1:15:31] it it could not
[1:15:33] work because the
[1:15:36] season for
[1:15:38] Ephesus required a certain form of
[1:15:43] Grace and that's what God gave
[1:15:46] them you cannot get the
[1:15:50] grace that God gave Ephesus and you give
[1:15:53] it to
[1:15:56] they cannot handle it they will mess it
[1:15:59] up
[1:16:01] Andia they being rebuked they are being
[1:16:05] corrupted they are being
[1:16:07] chastized God is trying to get
[1:16:10] his and thank God that you are being
[1:16:14] picked out
[1:16:16] of Amen listen now much as Peter was an
[1:16:22] apostle he could not understand
[1:16:26] how God was working among the
[1:16:31] Gentiles but yet they were both you know
[1:16:35] Apostles God could only give him an
[1:16:40] understanding for the needs of his
[1:16:42] Jewish
[1:16:43] people amen praise the Lord preaching
[1:16:49] stability I want to tell you friends
[1:16:52] that when God Saves you
[1:16:55] he places you in a
[1:16:59] place and puts the kind of
[1:17:02] Ministries that can be able to satisfy
[1:17:06] your
[1:17:10] need there are so many
[1:17:13] people who don't understand how God
[1:17:17] works and those are blown by every wind
[1:17:20] of
[1:17:22] doctr when a preacher comes in
[1:17:25] town they all gone with it because they
[1:17:29] are
[1:17:30] excited because every portion of
[1:17:34] ministry is good and necessary for the
[1:17:38] body but then that Ministry passing
[1:17:42] through is just a little
[1:17:45] dose that is supposed to bless you when
[1:17:49] you run away with that
[1:17:51] man you are going to find out that no
[1:17:55] there is something that I'm lacking
[1:17:58] here and that's why you see people they
[1:18:02] run out of church and come back in
[1:18:05] church
[1:18:08] again they've not found
[1:18:10] out the way God works with
[1:18:16] this on the general level on the general
[1:18:21] level we are
[1:18:23] Brethren but God when is
[1:18:26] Grace relevant to the needs of the
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:33] area you can't take me
[1:18:36] to and I become a successful Minister
[1:18:45] there in every stren circumstance
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:00] he releases his
[1:19:02] name wrapped in the needs of the
[1:19:07] people and that's why every local church
[1:19:11] is
[1:19:12] unique amen that's the way God
[1:19:16] works when he
[1:19:18] sees the needs of the
[1:19:21] people he wraps his name in there
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] I'm going to explain
[1:19:30] it in Revelation 2
[1:19:34] verse1 that's why every church is
[1:19:37] unique amen Revelation 2 chap I mean 2
[1:19:41] verse
[1:19:43] one the angel of the Church of of
[1:19:47] Ephesus
[1:19:50] right these things says he
[1:19:54] holds the Seven Stars in his right
[1:19:59] hand who walks in the midst of the
[1:20:01] golden
[1:20:08] candle are you together with me but is
[1:20:12] not saying the
[1:20:13] same for the church in
[1:20:18] sa he's identifying himself by different
[1:20:22] attributes
[1:20:25] but here at
[1:20:26] Ephesus he was demonstrating the
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:32] sovereignity of who he was through the
[1:20:35] entire seven
[1:20:39] churches that even in the next
[1:20:42] Church it will be me amen that's going
[1:20:47] to be
[1:20:48] sueme because there has never been a
[1:20:51] church
[1:20:52] before the church is starting here
[1:20:56] to the
[1:20:57] Gentiles
[1:20:58] withus and so he's telling them I am the
[1:21:02] one who holds the Seven
[1:21:05] Stars meaning there will be seven
[1:21:09] Church seven
[1:21:11] Messengers but they all originate from
[1:21:16] my so he was like introducing
[1:21:20] himself to these
[1:21:23] Gentiles understand
[1:21:25] how God was going to work through the
[1:21:29] churches are you together with me
[1:21:32] Ephesus was the god I mean in
[1:21:37] Ephesus was God demonstrating his
[1:21:39] sovereignty in the
[1:21:42] church he was demonstrating his Divine
[1:21:47] Authority that he was going to
[1:21:50] exercise through the seven churches
[1:21:54] he demonstrated
[1:21:56] himself holding seven
[1:21:58] steps and
[1:22:00] walking one step in
[1:22:09] E
[1:22:12] phia and all those seven churches there
[1:22:16] was no pop with him there was no
[1:22:18] Cardinal with him there was no Bishop
[1:22:21] with him there was no pastor with him
[1:22:24] trying to tell them that now the church
[1:22:27] is
[1:22:28] beginning it's going to run seven
[1:22:31] churches be me that will be
[1:22:38] spr there he is with the Seven Stars in
[1:22:41] his right
[1:22:43] hand the right hand arm signifies the
[1:22:47] power and authority of
[1:22:51] God this signifies that the very power
[1:22:55] and authority of
[1:22:57] God and behind the messengers of every
[1:23:03] age they go forth in the fire and power
[1:23:06] of the Holy
[1:23:09] Ghost with the
[1:23:11] word they are
[1:23:13] stars because they reflect
[1:23:16] light the light they reflect this
[1:23:20] light they have no light of Their Own
[1:23:24] they K not their own
[1:23:27] fire that men may walk in the light of
[1:23:30] their
[1:23:32] spars hallelujah hallelujah I cannot you
[1:23:36] know spark my own
[1:23:38] fire I have to contain and maintain you
[1:23:43] know that same
[1:23:46] fire but you find a
[1:23:48] minister like is the one who Sparks the
[1:23:51] fire like is the authority
[1:23:54] behind the
[1:23:59] word so the character of
[1:24:02] God is always
[1:24:06] wed Amen in the area of need of the
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:12] people they had never seen a gentile
[1:24:15] Church
[1:24:17] before so what they
[1:24:19] needed is to understand what God was
[1:24:24] starting with
[1:24:26] them and would go for the seven
[1:24:30] churches that was the
[1:24:33] need he works the same way in the local
[1:24:37] churches he stands in the
[1:24:41] weakness of the people and wraps
[1:24:47] himself in those
[1:24:49] weaknesses so that he may identify
[1:24:52] himself as their strength
[1:24:57] amen I'll give you an
[1:25:00] example in
[1:25:02] Genesis in the time when Abraham needed
[1:25:05] a
[1:25:08] lamb God wrapped his
[1:25:12] name in the need of
[1:25:15] Abraham so that he can
[1:25:18] declare that I am
[1:25:22] Jehovah are you together with
[1:25:25] me the title
[1:25:29] shalom shalom shom would not work for
[1:25:35] Abraham God wrapped
[1:25:38] himself in the need of
[1:25:41] Abraham to Ral himself to
[1:25:45] Abraham so what he did was to
[1:25:51] release aamb
[1:25:54] and when the lamb come
[1:25:56] forth it was Jehovah Gyra that's the
[1:26:00] need of
[1:26:01] Abraham it was not
[1:26:04] Jehovah he was not
[1:26:06] sick are you together with me so your
[1:26:10] needs dictate the need of the
[1:26:18] ministry are you together with me that's
[1:26:22] why you'll find many
[1:26:25] ministers they can come you can get
[1:26:28] excited a little bit but I want tell you
[1:26:32] but after some time you find there is
[1:26:35] something that you
[1:26:40] need
[1:26:42] amen praise the Lord in
[1:26:48] judg in the time when Israel was going
[1:26:52] into war
[1:26:54] in the time of
[1:26:56] Jon the Lord put forth the end of his
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:03] stuff amen and touched the Flesh and
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:12] un amen that Daniel was giving as a
[1:27:17] sacrifice and there arose a fire out of
[1:27:20] the
[1:27:21] Rock and consumed the flesh
[1:27:25] and the UN
[1:27:27] Cates then the angel of the Lord
[1:27:30] departed out of J
[1:27:33] son J
[1:27:35] realized that he had met the angel
[1:27:39] of and then he said fear not Thou shalt
[1:27:44] not die and when Jon built the
[1:27:48] altar he called it Jehovah
[1:27:52] shalom shom could not call it
[1:28:00] Jehovah he now talking about the peace
[1:28:03] of
[1:28:04] God in the midst of
[1:28:07] trouble is hiding his name in the needs
[1:28:11] of the
[1:28:12] people are you together with me that's
[1:28:15] how God
[1:28:17] works those seven Redemptive
[1:28:21] names will always wrap behind the local
[1:28:27] church all the seven Redemptive
[1:28:31] names were always
[1:28:33] go wrapping
[1:28:36] himself in the needs of the
[1:28:43] people that's why in the seven Church
[1:28:47] ages he says I am
[1:28:50] he that works in the seven golden cand
[1:28:56] that's where the need of the people
[1:28:59] was and that's how God was revealing
[1:29:02] him I am he that was dead but is now
[1:29:09] alive the persecution was coming
[1:29:12] on and so he wrapped
[1:29:15] himself in the ability of turning death
[1:29:19] to life in order to give the people
[1:29:22] courage
[1:29:24] that's the way God
[1:29:25] works he wrap
[1:29:28] himself in the needs of every local
[1:29:35] church are you together with me we
[1:29:38] cannot compare
[1:29:40] ourselves with the church in another
[1:29:44] area because by
[1:29:46] principle God RS in the
[1:29:51] gifts designed to deal with our local
[1:29:57] challenges so he WS in the approach of
[1:30:00] the
[1:30:02] world maybe brother
[1:30:04] Wilson maybe brother Dan or brother
[1:30:07] James or any of the
[1:30:10] ministers and it's
[1:30:14] God always allow those gifts on their
[1:30:20] side pray for them
[1:30:24] amen so the needs of the
[1:30:28] people are what shapes the local
[1:30:36] Ministry praise the Lord that's what
[1:30:39] shapes a local
[1:30:41] Ministry I don't know about other
[1:30:45] groups but your
[1:30:47] need shapes our
[1:30:51] gift you find some other
[1:30:54] people they dance five
[1:30:58] hours and preach for one
[1:31:00] hour that's okay for
[1:31:06] them are you together with me but you
[1:31:10] are fed on the
[1:31:15] word
[1:31:18] amen yes sir the Apostle in Peter
[1:31:25] was different from the Apostle in
[1:31:29] Paul because their needs were
[1:31:33] different your need shap my
[1:31:37] Ministry so the grace for the
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:40] ministry pour out
[1:31:44] differently in different
[1:31:47] areas amen God works in the same way in
[1:31:51] families
[1:31:54] amen your needs are
[1:31:57] different God will reveal himself
[1:32:00] different you have different
[1:32:04] testimonies based on the different
[1:32:06] challenges you have in your
[1:32:11] families to one
[1:32:13] family is Jehovah
[1:32:16] Rafa because they've had a
[1:32:19] sequel and God has helped to recover him
[1:32:22] from the sergeant
[1:32:26] when you talk to
[1:32:29] brother he will
[1:32:32] say he gave back my
[1:32:35] daughter as one from the
[1:32:38] dead are you together with me then to
[1:32:42] another is Jehovah Gyra he has supplied
[1:32:46] the
[1:32:47] need I than God I thought my children
[1:32:51] wouldn't do their exams
[1:32:55] but miraculous
[1:32:57] miraculous brother so and so bless me
[1:32:59] with such and
[1:33:07] such he does the
[1:33:09] same in our individual
[1:33:12] lives when we start to testify
[1:33:16] here you see people flowing on different
[1:33:22] Avenues why
[1:33:24] because they are meeting
[1:33:26] God on their individual
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] ground so God will always wrap his
[1:33:36] name in the needs of the
[1:33:40] people and because people fail to
[1:33:45] understand the way God
[1:33:48] works they start
[1:33:51] thinking that because we've got the
[1:33:56] Pam and then we've got you know uh
[1:33:59] virtues attached to
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:07] churches then the people said
[1:34:10] no in Ephesus it was
[1:34:14] Faith there was no
[1:34:18] godliness they make a
[1:34:21] mistake all these seven
[1:34:26] churches every one of
[1:34:28] them had all the
[1:34:31] Seven Virtues in
[1:34:36] them but then the
[1:34:39] challenges were different in every
[1:34:43] age so now the
[1:34:45] challenge is what produced a prominent
[1:34:49] virt
[1:34:56] but all of it were
[1:34:57] there amen but the
[1:35:01] challenge like in the age
[1:35:04] ofia the church is tor
[1:35:07] apart Brothers don't regard one
[1:35:11] another preach against one another
[1:35:14] in the prominent V we need now
[1:35:26] but not that all the other vires are not
[1:35:30] here but God always RS
[1:35:35] himself in the weaknesses of the
[1:35:38] people in the challenges of the people
[1:35:41] in order to bring their
[1:35:45] Victory all the virtues have been
[1:35:47] present in every
[1:35:50] age because these Seven Virtues
[1:35:54] the inner nature of
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] God there the inner nature of
[1:36:04] God but there was a
[1:36:07] virtue that was more prominent
[1:36:11] nevere to the needs of
[1:36:16] the are you together with me just like
[1:36:20] all of us there are some of you you
[1:36:24] don't have need of
[1:36:25] money so when we talk about Jehovah
[1:36:29] Gyra you don't understand it but then
[1:36:32] you've got problems of sickness and you
[1:36:40] always God
[1:36:46] hallelujah heavly father you are because
[1:36:49] that's your need
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:55] okay praise the Lord every age had a
[1:37:00] different manifestation of
[1:37:04] Grace and so are the different
[1:37:09] ministers amen God designs
[1:37:12] them and places in
[1:37:15] them something different one from
[1:37:19] another we can never be the same
[1:37:28] listen I'll go first Peter
[1:37:31] here 4 ver
[1:37:35] 10 as every man has received the
[1:37:43] gift so Minister the same one to
[1:37:49] another as good stewards of the manf
[1:37:54] grace of
[1:37:59] God Amen see every man has received a
[1:38:05] gift that he has to minister
[1:38:10] bad but then this gift
[1:38:13] here you were a
[1:38:15] steward that you may use it to minister
[1:38:20] to
[1:38:21] others and now listen
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:25] that's a Grace given to
[1:38:27] you but this grace is not
[1:38:32] un the Bible is calling it manold
[1:38:38] Grace amen which manifest
[1:38:42] differently Peter
[1:38:45] Apostle different John an apostle
[1:38:49] different Paul and Apostle different
[1:38:53] that's the way God
[1:38:57] works James an
[1:38:59] apostle we don't even hear that he ever
[1:39:02] went out of
[1:39:07] Jerusalem stuck right
[1:39:09] there but he
[1:39:11] was manf gifts of
[1:39:16] God and in all these gifts no man has a
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:23] to claim that his gift is greater than
[1:39:25] the other
[1:39:29] one no
[1:39:31] sir
[1:39:33] amen so every
[1:39:37] age had a different manifestation of
[1:39:41] Grace and so other different
[1:39:45] ministers with the different
[1:39:49] manifestations of the grace of
[1:39:51] God as Manifest
[1:39:54] by way of their
[1:39:56] gift so every
[1:39:59] man receives a gift in
[1:40:02] service and this gift shapes in levels
[1:40:06] of
[1:40:09] Faith depending on the nature of
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:17] need where that gift
[1:40:22] ministers where the people cry
[1:40:25] more God will give
[1:40:28] more and where people cry
[1:40:31] less God will give
[1:40:35] rest are you together with
[1:40:38] me
[1:40:39] sistera the more you
[1:40:42] cry is the more
[1:40:46] God
[1:40:49] Prov if this
[1:40:51] church is not in need
[1:40:54] there's no need for God to give
[1:40:58] more he says I'll remove the
[1:41:04] cand but when the people are still need
[1:41:09] every it pushes the
[1:41:12] minister heavenly father let me search
[1:41:15] for
[1:41:16] more it's a
[1:41:18] gift and God uses it to satisfy the
[1:41:22] needs of the
[1:41:28] praise the Lord and this
[1:41:32] gifts I've told you they come right from
[1:41:38] eternity it's not something God is going
[1:41:41] to throw at
[1:41:45] you you find a man who is not
[1:41:49] himself amen this year is something else
[1:41:55] another time is coming
[1:42:00] with he's changing all the
[1:42:03] time he's not satisfied with what he
[1:42:07] is tomorrow you'll find is dancing this
[1:42:13] way he's trying just to excite the
[1:42:19] people but we are dealing with preaching
[1:42:28] stability you know the joy of a
[1:42:31] parent is to see a baby
[1:42:35] stand and then when he
[1:42:37] stands you know you can
[1:42:42] scream scared
[1:42:46] you I see my daughters just clapping
[1:42:49] inside there because this baby is
[1:42:52] standing
[1:42:54] then falls down but still very happy at
[1:42:59] least he has been able to stand they
[1:43:01] rush for their
[1:43:03] cameras you know after taking the first
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:11] step not that they don't love the
[1:43:15] baby but they love the product
[1:43:19] better if you say you love this child so
[1:43:22] much
[1:43:24] each time he stands up you say it's
[1:43:26] going to
[1:43:28] fall then he will never
[1:43:35] walk are you together with me that's
[1:43:39] God he watches us we stand here and
[1:43:44] there what are you looking for you are
[1:43:47] looking for
[1:43:50] stability amen yeah you'll be
[1:43:56] athletic you can even run
[1:43:59] upstairs you don't even get
[1:44:02] scared we are talking about
[1:44:06] stability a stability that will never be
[1:44:09] blown by every wind of
[1:44:14] doctor a man who can stand up
[1:44:17] like and he says
[1:44:20] Paul called an apostle of Jesus
[1:44:25] Christ called to
[1:44:27] be an
[1:44:29] apostle amen he knows who he
[1:44:34] is praise the Lord he's not just trying
[1:44:38] to let me see whether this is my
[1:44:42] gift let me see whether this one is my
[1:44:46] gift you see
[1:44:48] Dan he can never preach like WI
[1:44:53] can bite his tongue
[1:44:55] out but he has a calling which is
[1:44:59] different that's the way God works with
[1:45:05] us there is me here I can never
[1:45:11] be you don't get me out of the pit
[1:45:14] sweating
[1:45:18] no but I have something to say
[1:45:24] that's God praise the Lord so as a young
[1:45:28] man you know that your
[1:45:33] gift is an eternal attribute of
[1:45:38] God Amen so in Romans 11 verse
[1:45:46] 29 I'm going to finish quickly don't
[1:45:51] mind he said is for the
[1:45:56] gifts and calling of
[1:45:59] God are without
[1:46:03] repentance when you
[1:46:06] believe that's not when you got the
[1:46:10] gift that gift was on the inside of
[1:46:14] you amen so
[1:46:17] gifts what are they they are the nature
[1:46:23] of
[1:46:24] character that God placed in the Gen
[1:46:29] SE for every
[1:46:35] particular God placed a
[1:46:38] nature of manifestation in
[1:46:41] you in your G before the foundation of
[1:46:46] the
[1:46:47] world and that's what a gift
[1:46:50] is so after designing the
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] call because gifts and callings are
[1:47:00] without
[1:47:03] repentance but then he designs
[1:47:09] the well I'm a
[1:47:12] pastor but what type of Pastor am I
[1:47:15] going to
[1:47:17] be so he works around
[1:47:20] you to design
[1:47:23] how you are going to
[1:47:27] minister in your call and then when he
[1:47:31] does that he puts a
[1:47:36] conscience a
[1:47:39] conscience amen of where the holy spirit
[1:47:42] is guiding
[1:47:45] you amen so the
[1:47:48] call is an eternal nature
[1:47:53] that nature was in
[1:47:56] Moses even when he was being raised in
[1:47:59] the house of
[1:48:01] pharaoh he knew there was something
[1:48:05] different he knew that it was not
[1:48:07] supposed to be that
[1:48:09] way so that
[1:48:12] conscience becomes the burden of the
[1:48:17] ministry and the Man start saying I feel
[1:48:20] a c brother
[1:48:22] I feel I need to do some for
[1:48:26] God Amen so and the
[1:48:31] burden became so heavy on
[1:48:35] Moses he chose rather to suff
[1:48:42] Affliction with the people of
[1:48:44] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:48:48] for a
[1:48:50] season that's how powerful that CA
[1:48:56] sometimes it will cause you to put away
[1:48:59] profitable
[1:49:03] things in your life if they are not
[1:49:06] right with
[1:49:07] God and you say no feel my C does not
[1:49:11] allow me to be this to do
[1:49:16] that are you together with me so a call
[1:49:19] to the
[1:49:20] ministry means that the man God
[1:49:24] chose for the
[1:49:27] season
[1:49:28] purpose and
[1:49:30] location has been able to
[1:49:34] identify who he is hallelujah hallu
[1:49:37] meaning now he can be able to testify
[1:49:42] like a Paul and say to be an
[1:49:50] apost so God always knows the
[1:49:53] man but then the man must catch up with
[1:49:57] the
[1:49:59] mystery of God's
[1:50:01] will in his
[1:50:05] life God knows who you are gifts and
[1:50:09] callings are without
[1:50:12] repentance but he gives you
[1:50:15] time so that you can come to a
[1:50:18] point of recognizing Who You Are
[1:50:25] are you together with me yeah time
[1:50:28] came and
[1:50:31] Moses started feeling
[1:50:34] compassion for the children of
[1:50:37] Israel and then
[1:50:39] God began to get into that
[1:50:43] gift he gave it a
[1:50:46] burden he allowed the
[1:50:50] trials to come
[1:50:53] you know how he killed that
[1:50:56] Egyptian amen and then finds these
[1:51:00] brothers fighting among themselves and
[1:51:03] then he says why you are all
[1:51:07] Hebrew why do you fight among
[1:51:10] yourselves says oh so you want to kill
[1:51:14] one of us like you killed that
[1:51:18] EG and Moses fled
[1:51:23] because the
[1:51:24] secret was
[1:51:29] known God is leading
[1:51:32] Moses into certain
[1:51:35] situations and the
[1:51:37] purpose is to help that
[1:51:41] Ministry that
[1:51:43] gift that call to go through
[1:51:47] testing and come to it maturity
[1:51:53] are you together with me you see when we
[1:51:58] talk about if a man desire the office of
[1:52:01] a
[1:52:06] bishop he really feels he can do the
[1:52:11] work the scripture says he must not be a
[1:52:19] noice and that's what God did for Moses
[1:52:24] Moses you are not going to get into this
[1:52:28] office as long as you are still in
[1:52:31] office you are doing the work
[1:52:34] differently you are doing the work
[1:52:36] wrongly Moses R to the
[1:52:39] Wilderness and it was
[1:52:41] needful for that Ministry to mature and
[1:52:45] when he came back he was working by the
[1:52:48] instructions of God
[1:52:55] praise the Lord you see sometimes when
[1:52:58] you start you know trying to advise
[1:53:01] people you don't do this you do
[1:53:09] this he doesn't want me to
[1:53:13] pre you see what I mean so listen
[1:53:18] Ephesians
[1:53:20] 1:9 he say
[1:53:23] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:53:28] his
[1:53:32] will every one of us will come to a
[1:53:37] spot where God makes known unto
[1:53:42] him the Myster of
[1:53:46] his because not all of us are going to
[1:53:49] be
[1:53:50] preachers but yet every one of us has a
[1:53:55] part in the body of
[1:53:59] Christ so the mystery of his
[1:54:04] will is the
[1:54:07] Revelation having made known unto us not
[1:54:10] unto
[1:54:14] me the mystery of his
[1:54:17] will according to his good
[1:54:21] pleasure which has purposed
[1:54:27] in in
[1:54:30] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:54:33] world in
[1:54:36] himself so this discover where your life
[1:54:39] functions
[1:54:43] best without a f
[1:54:47] motive and wait upon the Lord
[1:54:54] are you together with me the prophet
[1:54:57] says God's
[1:55:00] will is a
[1:55:01] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[1:55:06] will of
[1:55:08] God for his or her
[1:55:14] self God's
[1:55:18] mystery amen so Paul
[1:55:23] brother Bram
[1:55:24] says was there in
[1:55:28] Arabia rented him a little building
[1:55:32] somewhere walking up and down the
[1:55:35] floor with old
[1:55:41] Scrolls he had met
[1:55:46] God he had told him what he was going to
[1:55:50] do but the mystery
[1:55:55] is
[1:55:56] white Paul is
[1:55:59] wondering how am I going to do
[1:56:03] it he says I'm not going to put my mind
[1:56:06] in
[1:56:07] it let me go into prayer seek God find
[1:56:14] his perfect
[1:56:16] will for my
[1:56:18] Ministry is that amen
[1:56:22] he was there
[1:56:25] seeking
[1:56:26] crying praying calling
[1:56:30] God God will make
[1:56:34] us Le a certain
[1:56:38] way as we
[1:56:40] pray and study the
[1:56:43] word finally we shall
[1:56:47] discover who we are in the body of
[1:56:50] Christ
[1:56:54] there's too much of superal
[1:56:58] superal me God
[1:57:01] just just called me like
[1:57:07] that so much of
[1:57:10] it me God has called me
[1:57:14] God I even don't know nobody preach to
[1:57:21] me but let us get
[1:57:24] here first Samuel
[1:57:32] 3
[1:57:35] verse therefore Eli now you already know
[1:57:42] how uh Samuel's mother was crying to
[1:57:45] have a
[1:57:48] baby and then he cried in the Tabernacle
[1:57:54] and then you know finally she promised
[1:58:00] God that when I get a
[1:58:03] son I bring him back into the
[1:58:08] Tabernacle and that's what she
[1:58:12] did mothers are you
[1:58:16] here who have got some children from God
[1:58:22] no I just want to see
[1:58:25] mothers I'll bring them back to the
[1:58:30] Tabernacle that's the faith of Samuel's
[1:58:34] mother that I'll bring my children
[1:58:38] back to the
[1:58:40] Tabernacle listen I'm building up a
[1:58:43] thought Samuel is brought
[1:58:46] back the mothers brought him in the
[1:58:49] presence of the Lord
[1:58:53] and so the boy Samuel was always in the
[1:58:55] temple praying maybe studying the
[1:59:03] word and God started
[1:59:07] calling
[1:59:10] listen it is
[1:59:13] Eli who told
[1:59:16] Samuel how to relate to
[1:59:20] God to relate
[1:59:24] in first Samu
[1:59:26] 39 therefore Eli and
[1:59:30] Samuel said to
[1:59:33] Samuel go lie
[1:59:35] down because he has been called several
[1:59:39] times and then he keeps running to
[1:59:42] Samuel thinking Samuel is the one
[1:59:45] calling Samuel now is
[1:59:48] teaching I mean Eli is teaching Samuel
[1:59:54] to
[1:59:54] God he tells Samu go lie down and it
[2:00:00] shall be if he shall call
[2:00:02] thee thou
[2:00:05] sh for th servant
[2:00:08] here so Samuel went and La down in his
[2:00:14] place now there will always be a
[2:00:18] Ministry but never a true gift
[2:00:30] see no one is going to resist me it's
[2:00:33] not
[2:00:34] scripture regardless of how
[2:00:38] powerful your calling
[2:00:41] was there will always be a
[2:00:44] minister that will stand to guide that
[2:00:49] gift he might be a
[2:00:54] gift amen just like
[2:00:57] El but he must be there to guide you in
[2:01:02] your
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:03] ABC Amen brother Bram was a messenger to
[2:01:08] the but he needed
[2:01:13] dris yes to guide him in his initial
[2:01:19] stages don't be a supernatural
[2:01:29] amen and they are talking about lights
[2:01:32] and
[2:01:34] voices because even when Cornelius
[2:01:38] prayed and the angel came down the angel
[2:01:42] sent him back to a
[2:01:46] man
[2:01:48] elishah needed Elijah
[2:01:51] much as God gave him a double
[2:01:55] portion a greater gift than what
[2:02:00] Elijah preaching
[2:02:04] stability in local
[2:02:08] churches I want you to take me to Second
[2:02:14] Timothy 2 verse
[2:02:21] there should always be you know when you
[2:02:23] feel the
[2:02:27] call what shows you
[2:02:32] a is when you
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:35] stabilize under a
[2:02:39] Ministry waiting for your
[2:02:43] season
[2:02:47] and second
[2:02:50] Timothy vers
[2:02:58] one secondy
[2:03:07] verse this is
[2:03:09] Paul to
[2:03:12] Timothy thou therefore my
[2:03:17] son be strong in the grace that is in
[2:03:22] Christ
[2:03:26] Jesus
[2:03:28] verse
[2:03:30] amen and the things that thou Hast heard
[2:03:35] of me among many
[2:03:41] witnesses the same commit thou to
[2:03:44] Faithful
[2:03:47] Men Who Shall be able to teach others
[2:03:50] also
[2:03:54] amen so it is
[2:03:56] Paul
[2:03:58] Timothy timy Faithful
[2:04:01] Men
[2:04:03] TOS must be
[2:04:07] teaching so that the man May
[2:04:10] mature in the handling of the
[2:04:14] word amen because there is no
[2:04:17] way a seed will come because the seed is
[2:04:23] life but a seed I mean that life must
[2:04:28] have a body are you together with me
[2:04:31] yeah when we look at this be
[2:04:35] here amen the be
[2:04:39] itself is the
[2:04:41] life on the
[2:04:43] ins but the be we
[2:04:46] see it's a body
[2:04:54] are you together with me so now the seed
[2:04:59] comes by the
[2:05:02] body you have to have a
[2:05:05] be to go into the ground for it to
[2:05:08] produce another
[2:05:10] be amen even you to be born you are to
[2:05:16] come by the
[2:05:17] body there must be a way
[2:05:22] Minister coming
[2:05:23] through must
[2:05:25] submit to the body of another
[2:05:31] Minister brother Bram
[2:05:33] says the seed of
[2:05:36] Christ must come through his
[2:05:41] body not through a
[2:05:45] denomination but through a born again
[2:05:49] SE of the world
[2:05:52] must come
[2:05:53] through now
[2:05:55] remember what is
[2:05:57] it
[2:06:00] Chris how does my seed
[2:06:06] come through the
[2:06:08] body even in
[2:06:11] naturally you come through the body how
[2:06:14] does the apple tree seed
[2:06:19] come come I mean through through the
[2:06:22] body seed is through the body and the
[2:06:26] church is the body of Christ hallelujah
[2:06:30] hallelujah so you must be
[2:06:33] subject in the church to the
[2:06:37] ministry to
[2:06:39] you to maintain the stability of the
[2:06:48] church praise the Lord preaching
[2:06:53] stability and we are going to take some
[2:06:57] time amen so the
[2:07:00] principle is at the time of
[2:07:05] need then God stands
[2:07:08] out and calls
[2:07:11] out because he sees that his
[2:07:14] F has a mature
[2:07:19] crop then he stands up
[2:07:22] and he says I'm looking for a
[2:07:25] man who's going to stand in the
[2:07:28] Gap because there is a need
[2:07:31] in there a
[2:07:33] in there is a need
[2:07:36] in God is saying I'm looking for a man
[2:07:40] who can stand in the
[2:07:42] G he knows he knows the man but is
[2:07:46] looking for
[2:07:48] somebody who is really dedicated and rip
[2:07:55] enough that's why he comes to
[2:07:59] Isaiah and takes him before
[2:08:02] himself cleans his lips with
[2:08:05] fire and then he says whom shall we
[2:08:08] say because you are seeing a
[2:08:12] mature so young men SS and brothers you
[2:08:17] have got a position in the body but you
[2:08:20] must St the
[2:08:22] world so that your maturity may be a
[2:08:26] result of what you have fed
[2:08:29] of God will say whom shall I
[2:08:35] say in E
[2:08:40] 22 and I sought for a man among
[2:08:45] them that should make up the
[2:08:48] Hedge and stand in the gap
[2:08:53] before me in the
[2:08:57] land praise the Lord there was a bridge
[2:09:03] somewhere maybe that's where the enemy
[2:09:05] was attacking the
[2:09:07] CH and then you know it's a bridge it's
[2:09:10] a hall it's a
[2:09:13] gap and then he says I'm looking for a
[2:09:16] man who's going to stand and seal this
[2:09:19] guy
[2:09:23] maybe that Gap needs
[2:09:28] prayer I'm looking for a
[2:09:31] man that is going to seal this
[2:09:34] Gap maybe that Gap is a song
[2:09:38] leader amen man that will be able to
[2:09:42] deliver the
[2:09:45] congregation into real
[2:09:48] atmosphere before the minister comes
[2:09:53] he says I'm looking for a
[2:09:58] man so he seeks for mature
[2:10:02] men that will not be blown by every wind
[2:10:05] of
[2:10:07] dark seasoned
[2:10:10] men men who understand the purpose of
[2:10:13] their
[2:10:14] calling men who are
[2:10:17] ripe Amen to catch the faith and the
[2:10:20] purpose

[2:10:24] vision they understand what God wants
[2:10:28] done with
[2:10:30] this men that can handle the
[2:10:33] sword like the Mighty Men of
[2:10:36] David they can preach they can teach
[2:10:40] they can give seasoned counsel that's
[2:10:43] what God is looking for I'm looking for
[2:10:46] a
[2:10:50] man am amen so adoption message I'm
[2:10:56] finishing Amen brother Bram says Bible
[2:11:01] teaching this is a great quote
[2:11:05] here Bible teaching is usually a little
[2:11:13] Treach Treach
[2:11:18] [Music]
[2:11:22] kind of walking out on the thin
[2:11:27] ice but we just feel that maybe at this
[2:11:34] point and at this
[2:11:36] time it might be
[2:11:39] good to bring the church to what I think
[2:11:43] to a complete understand
[2:11:47] [Music]
[2:11:51] what we are in Christ Jesus and
[2:11:56] sometimes I think that preaching is
[2:12:00] wonderful but I believe
[2:12:03] sometimes that teaching goes beyond
[2:12:09] that especially to the
[2:12:11] church now
[2:12:13] preaching usually catches The
[2:12:16] Sinner brings him a condemnation by the
[2:12:19] word
[2:12:21] then everybody in church is
[2:12:25] crying and you know they are
[2:12:27] convicted but the preaching leaves them
[2:12:31] there
[2:12:33] teaching takes them
[2:12:37] further now that you in this
[2:12:41] condition God wants to do this that is
[2:12:46] teaching brother Bram says but teaching
[2:12:49] places a man
[2:12:54] what he
[2:12:58] is and we can never rightly be able to
[2:13:02] have
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:05] faith until positionally we know what we
[2:13:10] are hallelujah
[2:13:13] hallelujah he says teaching positions a
[2:13:17] man
[2:13:21] this is your
[2:13:22] position irus this is your position Mar
[2:13:26] this is your position and then the men
[2:13:30] will catch Faith related to their
[2:13:35] position he says when a man comes to
[2:13:38] that
[2:13:40] level he will have position of
[2:13:46] Faith praise the Lord so as you stud the
[2:13:50] word
[2:13:52] God begins to give you understanding of
[2:13:55] the Myster of his
[2:13:58] will for your life you discover your
[2:14:03] position in the body and then you will
[2:14:07] receive a suppor
[2:14:10] faith for that
[2:14:12] position by
[2:14:15] faith Hallelujah Hallelujah by faith
[2:14:18] Moses by faith
[2:14:21] everybody receiving Faith to support him
[2:14:25] in his position where God has
[2:14:29] pled God begins to work you in a certain
[2:14:34] CH and he says I sought for a man among
[2:14:40] them
