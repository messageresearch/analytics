[22:33] power Mighty Man of
[22:36] Valor amen you remember
[22:39] Gideon he he had such a low state of
[22:48] value he esteemed himself so
[22:51] low but God had his own thoughts about
[22:56] him Mighty Man of
[23:00] and he was hiding himself somewhere in
[23:01] the
[23:03] cave God can see us at different way
[23:06] that we can see
[23:08] ourselves and he knows how to encourage
[23:12] us because the comforter didn't yet
[23:15] leave the
[23:19] church the comforter holy spirit will be
[23:21] with us to the end of the
[23:25] world so go with your
[23:29] power every one of you have your own
[23:32] personal
[23:35] power but it's connected with your
[23:38] position it's connected with your new
[23:40] name I'm going to speak this afternoon
[23:43] about the power of the new
[23:46] name there is a mystery of the new
[23:49] name and doesn't lay in
[23:52] heaven it shouldn't only lay in the
[23:55] Bible but inside of you
[23:58] there is a mystery of your new
[24:00] name when we will discover our new
[24:04] name is changing our
[24:06] walk it's changing our
[24:09] talk it's changing the way we perceive
[24:14] ourselves it influence how we perceive
[24:16] the
[24:18] others is a high calling it's a
[24:21] different
[24:22] walk everything is
[24:24] changing when you hear directly from God
[24:27] your new
[24:30] name we supposed to live under the power
[24:32] of the new
[24:34] name I will give you
[24:38] testimony uh many years ago we started
[24:40] to print the books of brother Bram in
[24:42] English
[24:46] language and we did it uh we sent the
[24:49] parcels to many countries the
[24:56] world
[25:00] wherever the people they want to get
[25:01] that 200 300
[25:04] books uh booklets in the Box we send
[25:10] them but when the pandemic came like
[25:15] Corona they sto we couldn't send
[25:20] anymore so we have been very
[25:24] discouraged but you know the Lord made a
[25:26] way for us
[25:29] that uh uh we started to send the books
[25:31] not for the 200 300 but the 10,000 books
[25:34] on one
[25:38] pallette to many countries of
[25:42] Africa is only shows when the enemy is
[25:46] coming as a flat he wants to frighten
[25:50] you but if you
[25:52] not if you are not afraid of
[25:55] Satan but you believe God
[25:58] God will show you a highest
[26:01] standard if the waves of enemy is coming
[26:05] to cover to kill the
[26:09] people definitely the these waves will
[26:12] sunk some
[26:15] people but there will be a group of
[26:17] people that God will turn everything for
[26:21] good and by these waves he will lift you
[26:24] up
[26:26] higher you walk on these
[26:29] waves you will walk on the sea like
[26:33] Peter just stay on the post of
[26:36] Duty never allow the spirit of fear come
[26:39] upon
[26:40] you so God allowed us to to print 100
[26:43] th000
[26:46] books hundred and
[26:49] hundreds and you know this message is
[26:52] powerful because it uncovers the Satan's
[26:56] Edom
[26:59] uncovers Satan's Eden
[27:02] uncovers is showing the the schemes of
[27:05] the
[27:06] enemy that his throne is in the heart of
[27:09] the people
[27:12] today but he cannot deceive the
[27:15] bride because we are not part of Satan's
[27:18] Eden we are part of the different
[27:23] Eden restoration of the
[27:25] Eden is the r of the
[27:28] sun this is a new
[27:32] day the old things passed
[27:34] away and in the morning He restored the
[27:39] mercies because it's the rise of the
[27:42] sun we are the only
[27:45] species because we are eagles the sound
[27:48] doesn't blind
[27:50] us we can fly against the
[27:53] [Music]
[27:54] sun we can fly higher higher
[27:58] because we have a double
[28:01] eyelash so we cannot be blind like the
[28:04] eagles and this message removes the
[28:08] spirit of
[28:12] Amnesia because we've been part of God
[28:14] from the
[28:16] beginning we we are not saved here in
[28:19] this
[28:20] time you've been always
[28:22] saved you didn't become
[28:25] Christian you are always you've been
[28:27] Christian
[28:29] your name was placed the Lamb's Book of
[28:30] Life before the foundation of the
[28:33] world you are the very attribute of God
[28:36] manifest in
[28:38] flesh but the first birth gave us
[28:43] Amnesia but the second birth the new
[28:47] birth takes away Amnesia from
[28:51] us so listen those
[28:56] things
[28:58] Amnesia Spirit Amnesia you
[29:08] see because Amnesia is like a FK over
[29:13] you we have been covered by the
[29:17] FK so we we couldn't see where we
[29:20] are but this
[29:22] Amnesia is coming by
[29:25] stroke when the person
[29:27] sick he's losing a conscience who he
[29:31] is but by the washing of the
[29:35] word by the word of
[29:38] Separation God removes Tes away from us
[29:44] Amnesia and let you know who you
[29:46] are there the reason you have to
[29:48] recognize your day and his
[29:52] message it's not only the message of the
[29:54] hour but it's also your day
[29:58] some people they say yes I believe the
[30:00] message I believe the Bible I believe
[30:03] the promise for that
[30:05] age you have to recognize also your
[30:09] day God's calling your position your
[30:13] name will talk this afternoon about
[30:16] it beyond the curtain of
[30:19] time someone was taken
[30:22] up someone was taken
[30:24] up beyond the curtain of time
[30:28] it was like a Joshua he brought the
[30:31] report of the new
[30:32] land like Jesus he died he went up he
[30:37] came back as the Holy Ghost and gave us
[30:40] report of the new
[30:42] land Mal for
[30:44] Prophet was taken beyond the curtain of
[30:47] time when he came back he said I saw you
[30:52] there are you one of them one of them
[30:58] one of
[31:01] them I'm so glad that I say one of
[31:08] them one of them one of them one of them
[31:15] one of them I'm so glad that I can say
[31:21] one of
[31:23] them one of the
[31:26] masterpiece
[31:28] God is a
[31:30] sculpture he took your
[31:33] portion and removed from you
[31:36] everything that was not his
[31:38] vision that's how you are becoming a
[31:42] masterpiece there's a masterpiece of
[31:46] alpha there's a masterpiece of
[31:50] Omega coming from
[31:52] Christ the same piece of
[31:55] rock you are the master
[31:58] piece there's a time to count
[32:01] down we are living a zero
[32:04] hour rocket come
[32:07] down 10
[32:09] n
[32:12] 765 4 3 2
[32:15] 1 zero it means
[32:18] fire when the Elijah is on the
[32:20] Earth when the Elijah is on the earth
[32:24] this is a zero hour for the church
[32:28] be ready any
[32:31] time we will not go
[32:33] down we will not go to
[32:36] prison we'll go
[32:38] up by the power of spirit of
[32:43] Revelation amen hallelujah hallelujah
[32:47] because of the
[32:48] marriage
[32:51] inv oh there is no Union in the
[32:54] church people are blind there is a union
[32:58] in the
[32:59] church but this Union is
[33:02] invisible you must be a spiritual person
[33:05] to
[33:06] see there is a union of Christ and his
[33:10] bride and he will take up his
[33:14] body you will not go to tribulation
[33:17] period because you are
[33:20] Justified you have never done it in the
[33:22] first
[33:23] place they are
[33:25] Justified free your sinless
[33:29] bride your are Virgin of his
[33:33] word that's the reason we have approving
[33:36] of his
[33:38] word he came down son of man revealing
[33:44] flesh to marry
[33:46] you amen no the
[33:50] clergy not the
[33:53] clergy not any
[33:55] church son of man came down in
[34:00] flesh to make the bride and bridegroom
[34:05] one that's the reason you are the proof
[34:07] of his
[34:09] word hallelujah hallelujah we have some
[34:12] of the message with us we can give to
[34:14] the
[34:15] pastors after the
[34:18] meeting amen amen God bless you Saints
[34:22] glory to God for this message Hallelujah
[34:27] you are the message of the hour you are
[34:30] the open
[34:31] book take like
[34:33] Esther be identified with the word of
[34:36] the
[34:38] king and pro prophesy
[34:41] again take the book e it up and go your
[34:46] way this is a God in flesh
[34:49] again God promised
[34:53] that he will not take a church from he
[34:57] will not take a church before the
[34:58] tribulation
[35:04] period unfortunately the church will go
[35:07] through the purification
[35:12] period but before the tribulation Period
[35:16] start he will take up his
[35:20] word he will take up his
[35:22] bride because the bride she step out of
[35:25] the church
[35:28] this is a spirit element of this
[35:31] Exodus amen I ask you to stand
[35:35] up let's open a St Matthew
[35:40] 16 St Matthew
[35:45] 16
[35:48] amen St Matthew 16 from
[35:53] the
[35:55] verse 13
[36:07] when Jesus came into the course of
[36:11] cesaria philippy be asked he asked his
[36:15] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[36:20] the son of man
[36:25] am
[36:34] and they said some say that thou art
[36:38] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[36:41] Jeremiah or one of the
[36:51] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[36:55] you that I am
[37:01] and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[37:04] are the Christ the son of the Living
[37:11] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[37:15] blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for the
[37:18] Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto
[37:21] thee but my Father which is in
[37:25] heaven
[37:33] and I say also unto thee that thou are
[37:36] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build up
[37:40] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[37:42] not Prevail against
[37:52] it and I will give unto thee the keys of
[37:56] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[37:58] thou shal bind on Earth shall be bound
[38:00] in heaven and whatsoever thou shal lose
[38:03] on Earth shall be loose in
[38:15] heaven amen so there are three things in
[38:18] that portion of the
[38:20] scripture Peter he recognized a true
[38:25] revelation he just pick it up directly
[38:29] from the father not from the preacher
[38:32] not even from
[38:33] Jesus but the anointing Came Upon
[38:36] him he had access to the
[38:39] Father and Jesus said you are
[38:42] blessed because The Father revealed to
[38:45] you he had access to the
[38:49] spirit father is the spirit and then his
[38:52] name was
[38:54] change he was not Simon and
[38:57] more he was a
[38:59] Peter amen he was not
[39:03] Petra he was
[39:08] P I will build my church upon
[39:12] [Music]
[39:14] Petra Rock but your name is
[39:20] Petros a little rock that is part of the
[39:24] big
[39:25] rock
[39:27] but I will beat my church not upon Peter
[39:31] not upon Paul not upon Luther not upon
[39:35] William Bram not upon me or
[39:38] you upon the rock of

[44:55] name name of Lord Jesus
[44:57] Christ amen God bless you Saints please
[45:00] take your
[45:02] seats so we speak about the power of the
[45:06] new
[45:07] name the new
[45:09] name inside of The White
[45:13] Rock Rock in the Bible represents
[45:18] Revelation but also Rog in the Bible uh
[45:22] represents a
[45:24] statement
[45:27] confession and we know that today
[45:29] there's so many
[45:31] confessions religious
[45:34] confession I believe this I believe
[45:37] that and they don't Fellowship to each
[45:40] other because they are confessions are
[45:43] different but God promise will be a
[45:48] confession one
[45:50] Lord one faith and one
[45:54] baptism only one confession one
[45:58] Revelation one rock in
[46:02] Isaiah God said to Isaiah
[46:05] Prophet look inside of the
[46:08] rock that you are coming from did you
[46:11] see how I called Abraham and
[46:14] Sarah only these two I called them only
[46:19] two look at the Rock from you chop
[46:24] off amen
[46:26] God is the
[46:27] rock he's the rock of
[46:30] Revelation and all of us we supposed to
[46:32] be part of the same
[46:35] Rock Amen you know how there is a big
[46:38] rock in the
[46:40] mountains and there is the Mountain
[46:44] Brook it's very fast that the water is
[46:46] going
[46:48] down but you know through years the the
[46:51] the rocks are just uh disassembled from
[46:54] the big rock
[46:58] it
[46:59] crumbles it's coming to the to the brook
[47:01] of the
[47:03] water and the strong current of the
[47:06] water is pushing the Rocks down down
[47:09] down
[47:10] down it's coming from the high lower
[47:12] lower
[47:14] lower you think why it
[47:16] happens because when these small rocks
[47:18] they are coming from the big
[47:22] rock they are
[47:24] Sharp able to
[47:26] cut easily to hurt
[47:29] you but in the Stream of the
[47:31] water being assembled
[47:34] together it's like a heating each to
[47:37] other but after some years of
[47:41] process they are
[47:44] transformed they are coming to the Sea
[47:47] they coming the ocean and they nice
[47:52] Pebbles round
[47:54] around nothing can hurt you cannot hurt
[47:58] each other but the stone that is run
[48:02] around we are in the process
[48:05] friends amen
[48:08] transformation by the washing of the
[48:10] water of the
[48:12] world but we are part of the same great
[48:17] Rock and we are on the way
[48:20] back because we will spend the whole
[48:22] eternity
[48:24] together
[48:26] if the Rog represents
[48:29] Revelation if the Rog represents a
[48:34] revelation and the statement
[48:37] confession like a Peter has
[48:39] done in the Matthew
[48:42] 16 I will give you one
[48:45] example in the Old Testament they didn't
[48:48] have a perfect word of
[48:51] God the word of God was not yet
[48:54] completed it was not the perfect
[48:57] Revelation so God was using uim and
[49:02] tamim and we know those a birth plate of
[49:05] the high
[49:07] priest you know any time the someone had
[49:10] the Revelation like a vision or
[49:14] dream they brought the person to the
[49:18] Tabernacle and he was standing before
[49:20] the
[49:21] priest and he was telling his
[49:24] revelation you know what the Paul he
[49:27] said even in the angel will come from
[49:31] heaven and say something different from
[49:33] that
[49:35] word from the previous original
[49:40] Revelation follow
[49:42] it even me myself Paul he
[49:45] said even the bright angel from
[49:49] heaven don't follow it it must be
[49:53] scriptural so when the person was
[49:56] telling his
[49:58] Revelation and there was a birth plate
[50:01] of the high
[50:03] priest if he spoke the
[50:05] truth there was a shaking of Glory
[50:08] coming down from
[50:10] heaven and he was reflecting himself in
[50:13] the
[50:15] stones if this is what the
[50:18] truth there was a
[50:20] rainbow Supernatural
[50:24] colors twinking
[50:26] around if not if it was not the truth
[50:30] was no
[50:31] Supernatural no glory in the
[50:34] temple I want to tell you
[50:36] something these 12
[50:38] Stones represented 12
[50:41] names so the name is attached to a
[50:46] stone this 12
[50:48] Stones 12 names represented 12 tribes of
[50:54] Israel so these names the stones
[50:58] represented the whole
[51:01] church but the stones that coming from
[51:03] the
[51:05] earth we are born from the
[51:08] earth amen but the sh was coming from
[51:13] heaven and if there was a Voice of
[51:17] Truth was completely identified with
[51:19] that
[51:21] Stones the supernatural light hit every
[51:24] stone
[51:28] Benjamin Benjamin reuben reuben Joseph
[51:33] God was identified with every
[51:36] stone with every name that was attached
[51:40] to a
[51:41] stone I tell you Jesus Christ the same
[51:44] yesterday today and
[51:48] forever I'm asking you friends where are
[51:52] those

[54:18] break your your
[54:20] bones because his name is
[54:24] Defender but if you are born again your

[54:38] rock
[54:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I have
[54:43] a
[54:44] question is there anyone here in this
[54:47] wonderful
[54:50] congregation that is not happy of his
[54:52] Earthly
[54:54] name
[54:55] and you are eager to know your new
[54:59] name is there anyone here not happy with
[55:01] the natural Earthly
[55:04] name that you thought many times if my
[55:08] parents would give me a better
[55:12] name can I see your
[55:17] hands it seems this is very happy
[55:23] congregation oh you you you wish to have
[55:26] a different
[55:27] name am I
[55:32] right he had the name which he did not
[55:35] want was
[55:37] called
[55:42] uhhuh it means that suffering is not for
[55:45] one so he was to
[55:49] suffer so he requested to change his
[55:51] name and was given oh
[55:55] so you have already new
[55:58] name yeah yeah God bless you okay it's
[56:03] also a very good
[56:04] idea when I was in India I asked what's
[56:08] your name brother my name is Paul what's
[56:11] your name my name is John what's your
[56:14] name my name is William what's your name
[56:17] sister my name is mid oh my goodness you
[56:21] have such a good names and you are from
[56:23] India and they said all of us we had the
[56:26] bad
[56:29] names all of us we had the names of our
[56:34] Gods but when I I believe the message I
[56:37] believe Jesus Christ and I was baptized
[56:40] in the name of Lord Jesus
[56:41] Christ Pastor gave me a new name yeah
[56:45] Peter Paul amen yeah Mary amen you
[56:51] John that's how it
[56:53] works
[56:55] we need to have a good
[56:57] name I'm going to speak to
[57:00] you that even our Earthly
[57:04] name is not the main
[57:08] one because the Bible says when you are
[57:11] getting the name from
[57:14] God no one will know
[57:17] it only
[57:20] receiver and this is not for the natural
[57:23] birth because this is promise for
[57:27] Overcomers you will have to
[57:31] overcome Satan's
[57:33] even the evil
[57:35] age you will have to overcome
[57:39] yourself you you will have to overcome
[57:42] the lineage of your old
[57:46] family your
[57:49] temperament your
[57:52] temperament your habits this is the
[57:55] promise for
[57:57] Overcomers if you will
[58:00] overcome I will give you a white
[58:03] stone we know the white is the only
[58:06] original
[58:09] color that's the reason Revelation
[58:12] 19 Revelation
[58:15] 19 Jesus will ride on the White
[58:19] Horse but you
[58:22] too because his Army we
[58:26] go his army are
[58:29] believers he Jesus he's got name new
[58:33] name word of
[58:36] God the Bible says it's written on his
[58:40] vure his new
[58:42] name Revelation 19 his Earthly name was
[58:48] Jesus
[58:49] Savior but he saved he redeemed the
[58:53] names but now when he came to
[58:56] Glory he got a new name his name is word
[59:00] of
[59:02] God that's the reason we see the mess in
[59:05] the
[59:07] churches because they are worshiping
[59:10] historical
[59:13] Jesus oh yes I know
[59:16] Jesus yes Jesus Loves
[59:18] Me I I I know that he he has chosen me
[59:23] and on and on he died for me 2,000 years
[59:27] ago amen but Jesus is Alive what about
[59:31] today you need a word for
[59:35] today his new name is the word of
[59:39] God because at the beginning was the
[59:42] word the word was with God and the Word
[59:46] was
[59:48] God and the same word became
[59:50] flesh in Jesus but Jesus Christ the same
[59:54] yesterday today and
[59:58] forever it must be also the word of God
[1:00:01] in flesh of his
[1:00:05] church so Jesus will ride on his
[1:00:08] horse on his white power pure
[1:00:12] power but your horse and uh your garment
[1:00:16] is also
[1:00:20] white so it proves that your power is
[1:00:23] not intermingle with any other
[1:00:28] power there is a power behind the
[1:00:32] gospel there's a power behind the
[1:00:35] word and it's
[1:00:38] pure it's
[1:00:40] original it's
[1:00:41] clean hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:00:46] wonderful we can still ride on our
[1:00:49] horse amen amen there was a brother he
[1:00:53] was a pastor
[1:00:55] in Jeffersonville or
[1:00:58] around his name was Junior
[1:01:01] Jackson and uh in a certain
[1:01:06] dream uh he
[1:01:08] saw there was a a
[1:01:12] horse big horse from Heaven provided for
[1:01:18] him and he was a pastor he believed in M
[1:01:21] brother
[1:01:23] Bram but he was he had his own
[1:01:27] ideas little mixed with the
[1:01:29] word but God gave him a chance he sent
[1:01:33] him a horse which is the power from
[1:01:36] heaven and it was a beautiful horse and
[1:01:40] he should just sat on the horse and
[1:01:42] go but there was his
[1:01:45] wife start to talk to him so he looked
[1:01:49] back and start to communicate with his
[1:01:52] wife and we know the woman is a
[1:01:55] church so the pastor he came under
[1:01:58] influence of his
[1:02:01] church when God has provided for him a
[1:02:05] superpower a horse from Heaven that fit
[1:02:08] to
[1:02:09] him but he just looked back start to
[1:02:13] talk his
[1:02:14] wife when he again look horse was not
[1:02:19] there the power
[1:02:21] disappeared that's the reason we have to
[1:02:23] be careful
[1:02:26] stay with your
[1:02:27] power stay with your name stay with your
[1:02:31] position don't listen
[1:02:34] everyone don't come under any other
[1:02:36] influence only the
[1:02:40] word because the name of Jesus today is
[1:02:42] the word of
[1:02:45] God you are the living
[1:02:48] Apostles you are the Living Word of
[1:02:51] God the living voice living
[1:02:56] manifestation of that
[1:02:58] Bible that will not go to
[1:03:01] Rapture it will not go to Rapture but
[1:03:04] you will go to
[1:03:06] Rapture this is the word of God but this
[1:03:09] is not enough to go to
[1:03:12] Rapture that is a quickening power to
[1:03:16] make a living word of God for
[1:03:20] your hallelujah
[1:03:22] hallelujah so now we are diving a little
[1:03:25] more into the new
[1:03:28] name do you know that uh when brother
[1:03:31] Bram was
[1:03:32] born was given to him a new
[1:03:36] name maybe you don't know it but I spoke
[1:03:40] with some
[1:03:42] eyewitnesses
[1:03:45] eyewitnesses people from his
[1:03:47] area and when uh his father Charles Bram
[1:03:53] Charles Bram
[1:03:55] uh before William was
[1:03:59] born Charles
[1:04:01] Bram Charles Bram six
[1:04:06] letters he changed his name to Charles
[1:04:09] Bram seven
[1:04:14] letters before he
[1:04:23] was before he was at Charles Bram six
[1:04:29] letters but he he went to the local
[1:04:32] authorities and he changed his name
[1:04:34] adding
[1:04:43] H so he became a Charles AB Bram seven
[1:04:49] letters we know that Bible runs with
[1:04:53] numbers
[1:04:56] the Bible runs with
[1:04:58] numbers we know the first Man was
[1:05:02] created in a seven day six
[1:05:06] day and seven day got
[1:05:09] rest amen eight is
[1:05:13] eternity four is number of
[1:05:17] Deliverance three is
[1:05:20] Unity seven
[1:05:22] Perfection 12 24 is a
[1:05:27] worship amen 17
[1:05:31] Redemption 40 Temptation and
[1:05:36] deliverance 50 is a
[1:05:40] jubilee and the seventh is a
[1:05:43] fullness so the whole Bible rounds with
[1:05:47] numbers but the six is a number of the
[1:05:51] men because the man was creating the
[1:05:53] sixth
[1:05:56] day so it is not anymore Bram but
[1:06:00] [Laughter]
[1:06:03] Bram God allowed before was
[1:06:07] born we know that he was born with a
[1:06:11] commission he was born with a pit of
[1:06:15] fire but he was Bram seven
[1:06:19] letters but we know that Graham Billy
[1:06:22] Graham six letters
[1:06:26] he was a messenger to the
[1:06:29] world preach the gospel to
[1:06:32] Sodom calling them
[1:06:34] out
[1:06:36] Bram seven letters there was a
[1:06:41] h and a
[1:06:43] h like
[1:06:45] Abraham is a God's
[1:06:49] breath God breathes when he
[1:06:52] speaks when he's changing your
[1:06:55] name he breathes on
[1:06:58] you there is a power
[1:07:01] behind so brother Bram was born as
[1:07:03] William
[1:07:05] Bram seven letters if you would ask him
[1:07:09] being one week old or maybe month
[1:07:17] old maybe two years
[1:07:19] old what's your
[1:07:22] name two
[1:07:25] years what's your
[1:07:28] name he didn't know but he was already
[1:07:32] William which means will I
[1:07:37] am
[1:07:42] am William means will I
[1:07:50] am so he had the beautiful name William
[1:07:54] Mar Bram William Mar Bram three *
[1:08:00] seven God wanted to show you
[1:08:03] something but when he was one year
[1:08:07] old if someone ask him what's your
[1:08:14] name he didn't know he didn't know who
[1:08:17] he was but he was William Mario
[1:08:22] Bram God made him
[1:08:25] this when the child is born he's
[1:08:28] receiving a name
[1:08:30] directly as the little small kid or
[1:08:36] baby he doesn't know but officially he's
[1:08:39] got a
[1:08:42] name since you are born
[1:08:45] again getting
[1:08:48] name not from the parents from
[1:08:52] God
[1:08:54] but you don't know
[1:08:56] it maybe you are talking with the
[1:08:58] unknown
[1:09:00] tongues when I was
[1:09:03] saved I was talking unknown tongues all
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:07] time because I found what the Paul
[1:09:10] said I'm speaking with the unknown
[1:09:12] tongues more than the
[1:09:14] others so I was talking talking and
[1:09:18] talking but I didn't know my new
[1:09:21] name I was talking to God
[1:09:24] but then I realize there's also another
[1:09:27] channels of
[1:09:29] communication if you don't if you talk
[1:09:32] to God all the
[1:09:33] time with the unknown tongues you don't
[1:09:36] understand
[1:09:38] conversation you don't understand
[1:09:42] conversation it's
[1:09:44] mysterious It's
[1:09:46] Supernatural but you don't understand
[1:09:49] but the whole Paul he
[1:09:50] said you can pray according to mind
[1:09:55] and you can pray also on other level
[1:09:58] without
[1:10:01] mind so when you pray with the unknown
[1:10:04] tongues you are praying out of
[1:10:08] mind this is different
[1:10:10] Channel but you don't
[1:10:13] understand but the inner man is
[1:10:15] growing this is good but God also
[1:10:19] provided for
[1:10:20] you the way of communication you will
[1:10:23] understand
[1:10:26] a conversation with
[1:10:28] god can you imagine if I would just go
[1:10:31] we like with my wife to
[1:10:35] walk we we walk every day five seven
[1:10:38] kilometers just to
[1:10:42] walk just to uh give a favor to our
[1:10:49] bodies because this is a temple of the
[1:10:51] holy
[1:10:52] spirit so so we go and walk and talk can
[1:10:56] you imagine that uh uh uh I would speak
[1:10:59] to my
[1:11:01] wife for one
[1:11:03] hour amen amen amen amen
[1:11:06] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:09] hallelujah
[1:11:10] hallelujah that's how the people
[1:11:12] sometimes they talk to God in the
[1:11:15] churches Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory
[1:11:18] Glory
[1:11:22] Glory no one understands
[1:11:25] that the person doesn't
[1:11:27] understand God doesn't understand
[1:11:31] congregation doesn't
[1:11:32] understand people are coming to church
[1:11:35] and they think they are
[1:11:38] crazy there there re a Paul he said pray
[1:11:40] with
[1:11:43] understanding when you want to pray with
[1:11:45] unknown tongues pray
[1:11:50] secretly when you come to a congregation
[1:11:53] like this
[1:11:55] praise with
[1:11:58] understanding amen say Amen upon the
[1:12:01] word with
[1:12:04] understanding pray to God with
[1:12:08] understanding and he will just speak to
[1:12:10] you
[1:12:12] back that's the reason we have to
[1:12:14] grow that's what we call
[1:12:17] adoption you cannot stay like a
[1:12:20] baby angel of the Lord he w brother
[1:12:25] Bram don't stay always with the
[1:12:27] Pentecostal
[1:12:31] babies there's a
[1:12:34] saying if if if you are on certain
[1:12:38] position and you will come on this
[1:12:41] position Jesus he said do it for a
[1:12:45] while if you see a brother he needs a
[1:12:48] help he ask you go with me one
[1:12:52] mile go with him even
[1:12:55] two but when you cover two
[1:12:58] miles tell to the brother I'm sorry I
[1:13:02] love you brother I I wanted to show you
[1:13:05] compassion and understanding so I walk
[1:13:08] with you more than you
[1:13:10] expected but this is good
[1:13:12] direction I go this direction you can go
[1:13:16] with me or you can go your way
