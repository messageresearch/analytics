[1:45] talking about the precious memories of
[1:47] my childhood
[1:49] well I could say
[1:52] it was when I played with my brothers
[1:56] with my father
[1:58] or even took photos as a family
[2:03] was it when Dad came home with meat rice
[2:06] bread blue Vines
[2:09] was it when we had Christmas together or
[2:12] sat together when having breakfast
[2:15] lunch and summer was it when we had
[2:19] family gatherings and we could meet our
[2:21] cousins and other relatives
[2:25] was it when we had Church punches of
[2:27] giving thanks to God
[2:31] foreign
[2:35] all these are precious moments but the
[2:39] precious memories are
[2:42] when we sang sons of Praise at the
[2:44] family also and those on our knees as a
[2:48] family and pray
[2:49] it was when that taught us how to fast
[2:53] and pray or raise commit ourselves to
[2:57] God
[2:58] it was when he told us that when we have
[3:02] Christ in our lives that's when we will
[3:04] truly be happy
[3:05] it was when Mom used to hear
[3:09] [Music]
[3:11] praying crying leading for us to God in
[3:15] the morning in the afternoon and in the
[3:18] evening
[3:19] it was when I could get a hold of the
[3:22] mic and sing for him not minding what
[3:25] people will say
[3:28] and it's those precious memories
[3:31] that out brought us this far
[3:36] believe
[3:37] that each one of you sitting here
[3:40] has Precious Memories
