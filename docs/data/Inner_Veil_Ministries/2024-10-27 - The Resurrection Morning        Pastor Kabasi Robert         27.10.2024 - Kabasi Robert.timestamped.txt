[41:28] the book of St
[41:32] Mark verse 1 up
[41:37] verse says when the Sabbath was passed
[41:40] Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
[41:42] James and salom had brought sweet spices
[41:47] that they might come and anoint him
[42:01] and very early in the morning the first
[42:04] day of the week they came unto the SE at
[42:07] the rising of the
[42:15] Sun and they said among themselves who
[42:18] shall Roar us away the Stone from the
[42:21] door of the spalle and when they looked
[42:24] they saw that the stone was roded away
[42:27] for it was very
[42:43] great and and entering into the SE they
[42:47] saw a young man sitting on the right
[42:50] side clo long white garment and they
[42:53] were Afra
[43:06] and he said unto them be not
[43:08] afraid you seek Jesus of Nazareth which
[43:12] was crucified he is risen he is not here
[43:16] behold the place where they laid him
[43:33] may God bless theing of his
[43:36] word we may get
[43:40] seated so it's a great
[43:45] morning I trust that the Lord really has
[43:47] been very gracious to to
[43:51] you and I'll just come to give a few
[43:54] compliments
[43:58] Amen on Friday back home I was talking
[44:01] about
[44:05] motherhood and I say that the
[44:08] mothers always uh really speak a lot of
[44:12] what the children are going to
[44:16] be and they give
[44:19] prophetically of what the child is going
[44:21] to
[44:23] be uh similar the churches
[44:27] where we are
[44:28] born they speak a
[44:31] lot of what we are going to
[44:33] be they
[44:35] prophesy and as the word is going
[44:38] forth It's a prophecy it catches you and
[44:43] ites you like the way the mother the
[44:47] Hebrew
[44:48] mothers when they were going through
[44:51] pain they would cry and cry but every
[44:55] time when they cried and called the name
[44:57] of that
[44:59] child that put the child exactly where
[45:02] that child was supposed to
[45:05] be and the preaching of the word in a
[45:07] local
[45:09] church always places us exactly where we
[45:12] are
[45:14] supposed is that amen and I appreciate
[45:17] God that if there's anything I'm going
[45:20] to
[45:21] preach it's what I was mothered to
[45:25] preach amen so Pastor not run away from
[45:29] what I'm going to
[45:31] pre not run away amen because a child
[45:36] will always be what the mother
[45:39] is I'm talking about the resurrection
[45:43] morning amen you know we see that on
[45:47] that
[45:48] day when they had gone through a lot of
[45:53] groom a lot of rejection
[45:57] and the church was
[45:59] scattered what could only bring the
[46:02] church
[46:03] together was a
[46:06] resurrection amen because everything had
[46:10] failed but there was only one prophecy
[46:13] which had
[46:15] remained and that was the prophecy of
[46:17] the
[46:19] Resurrection amen but when it came the
[46:23] people never knew
[46:25] it not understand but it it was the day
[46:31] they were still in the
[46:34] groom they were still in
[46:37] sadness they wanted to anoint the
[46:40] dead they want to associate
[46:43] themselves with
[46:45] Jesus as a dead person but Jesus
[46:50] wanted for them to be associated with
[46:53] him in the resurrection
[46:57] amen so the lord gave me a subject I've
[47:00] been really battling and wondering what
[47:02] am I going to speak on such a
[47:06] subject the resurrection
[47:09] morning what a day that it
[47:12] was what a time that it
[47:15] was that amen that you know when
[47:19] Jesus had turned the whole
[47:22] universe what it had never seen
[47:26] a new generation or a new era all
[47:30] together amen people had
[47:33] died great people had
[47:36] died and they had been
[47:39] mourned the world would
[47:41] gather but
[47:44] nobody had ever risen
[47:46] up amen no one had even never made a
[47:52] claim that I can put down my life
[47:57] it up again it was only one man who did
[48:01] it who spoke it and fulfilled it and
[48:06] that was Jesus Christ is that amen the
[48:09] prophet tells us of all the religions of
[48:12] the world there is only one religion
[48:16] which has got a living
[48:18] follower is that amen that's
[48:22] Christianity the Buddhists they are very
[48:25] good in the psychology
[48:28] the Muslims they can always point you to
[48:31] the
[48:32] grave and every every child every
[48:36] denomination they have got a grave where
[48:38] their
[48:39] follower where their Master
[48:43] is we have got an empty
[48:46] grave am it was proved on the
[48:51] resurrection
[48:52] morning when when the angel
[48:55] said come inside here don't even just
[48:59] stand out there they were saying who
[49:02] will run away the the stone when they
[49:05] reached the stone was already roll away
[49:09] is that amen they were wondering how are
[49:12] they going to anoint him but when they
[49:15] reached he was not there the grave was
[49:18] already
[49:20] empty is that amen it changed their
[49:25] conception and
[49:27] Christianity is based on
[49:31] Resurrection amen the prophet says says
[49:36] if God made a way for a flower to
[49:41] live again how much more he did for a
[49:46] man to live
[49:49] again the whole basis of
[49:53] Christianity is based upon the
[49:55] fundamental fact of
[49:59] Resurrection amen says now if I should
[50:02] drop this on the
[50:05] floor now to pick up this off the
[50:08] floor would not would not be not be a
[50:11] resurrection or or pick up something
[50:13] that looks like
[50:16] it it wouldn't be a resurrection
[50:20] Resurrection is pick up the same thing
[50:24] that dropped down
[50:27] amen you know if I if I throw a paper
[50:30] here and then I pick something else that
[50:34] is not a
[50:35] resurrection sometimes we always say
[50:40] locally that you know when somebody dies
[50:44] and then the children produce another
[50:48] person they said the other one has
[50:51] resurrected no that's not a
[50:53] resurrection is that amen that's another
[50:56] person all together a resurrection would
[50:59] be that very person who went into the
[51:03] ground coming up again that's what we
[51:07] call a
[51:09] resurrection is amen and Jesus Christ in
[51:13] Romans
[51:15] 81 we are told that the same
[51:19] spirit that raise up Jesus Christ from
[51:24] the dead that spirit dwelleth to us that
[51:28] same spirit will Quicken our mot
[51:31] bodies that amen it will resurrect us it
[51:36] will change these bodies from
[51:40] corruption
[51:42] incorruption
[51:44] fromal immortality That's the basis of
[51:49] Christianity is that amen if there is no
[51:53] Resurrection we are like any other
[51:55] denomination
[51:57] is that amen if there is no Resurrection
[52:00] we are like the Buddha we are like the
[52:04] Muslims we are like every like all the
[52:07] tradition
[52:08] is they also teach good
[52:11] discipline is that amen some of them are
[52:14] much better than the
[52:17] Christians the greatest thing with
[52:20] Christianity is a
[52:22] resurrection amen it's a change of our
[52:25] body
[52:27] some religion is teaching that when you
[52:29] die you'll come back but you may come
[52:32] back like maybe an
[52:35] old amen you may come back like a
[52:40] CL and they may see certain
[52:43] animal moving on the
[52:46] ver and they say so and so is moving
[52:50] out not like that
[52:54] Resurrection is talking about
[52:57] you as the Lord has made you to rise up
[53:01] again to pick up that body and come back
[53:06] again is that amen it's not coming back
[53:10] as an
[53:11] angel we are not going to come back as
[53:14] angels we are going to come back
[53:18] according to Resurrection the very way
[53:20] we
[53:21] are is that amen we shall pick up these
[53:25] bodies
[53:27] do you love the
[53:29] Lord
[53:30] Resurrection is not picking up is not
[53:33] picking up something
[53:35] else it's not coming back maybe like as
[53:39] if you a
[53:40] star you not come back as a
[53:43] St no when we
[53:46] resurrected we come back the very way
[53:50] that God meant us to be so when they
[53:53] went in the
[53:54] morning they saw an angel
[53:57] Jesus was not an angel is that amen he
[54:01] said he is not here he's already Ren is
[54:05] that amen when we when we come to
[54:08] Christianity we take long anointing the
[54:13] dead it take a long time anointing the
[54:17] dead is that amen we anoint the body we
[54:21] take care of the body but we must look
[54:25] at rection because the time come when
[54:30] this body must be able to be
[54:32] changed and
[54:34] Resurrection speaks of
[54:37] change amen it speaks of what you would
[54:40] call maybe genal engineer or something
[54:43] like
[54:47] that amen it changes this
[54:50] body from time to
[54:54] immortality amen it changes this
[54:58] weakness into strength it changes all
[55:02] the weaknesses of the
[55:04] body and gives us another form all
[55:10] together amen so if the spirit that was
[55:14] in Jesus
[55:16] Christ inside of us the same way Jesus
[55:19] rose up the same we shall rise up again
[55:24] is that amen there is going to be a
[55:26] Resurrection
[55:28] morning sometimes we
[55:30] worry sometimes we fear sometimes we cry
[55:35] and we say this all that man was meant
[55:38] to
[55:39] be is that amen because after solving
[55:43] one
[55:45] problem another one is
[55:47] coming is that amen after resting in the
[55:51] night there's another day which is
[55:54] coming after eating today
[55:56] there is another that you want food
[55:59] after paying school fees before you know
[56:02] you have got to pay school fees again
[56:04] after buying a new cloth before you know
[56:07] you need another
[56:09] one it looks like a constant
[56:12] cycle of
[56:14] suffering a constant cycle of things
[56:17] that cannot stand the test of
[56:20] time but the
[56:22] resurrection does not only speak about
[56:25] gaining back our
[56:26] body it speaks about a changed
[56:32] body amen the prophet says the greatest
[56:36] event that has ever
[56:38] happened in the world is the
[56:41] resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[56:43] Christ amen of all the things that have
[56:48] happened the resurrection of Jesus
[56:50] Christ was the greatest thing that ever
[56:54] happened and the greatest that we are
[56:57] waiting
[56:58] for is the
[57:01] resurrection of our
[57:03] bodies amen it's going to be a wonderful
[57:08] day it's going to be a precious
[57:11] day together when all the sa of long
[57:16] ago all the Beloved ones that we have
[57:20] walked with that we have sat with that
[57:24] have been covered down when they
[57:27] overcome that devil Called
[57:30] Death is that amen when they rise up
[57:34] again it's going to be a wonderful
[57:38] morning amen and we know that it's going
[57:41] to be a
[57:43] morning is that amen because
[57:46] Resurrection takes place in the
[57:49] morning amen when we sleep we rise up in
[57:53] the morning
[57:56] when Jesus Christ rose up the says very
[58:01] early in the
[58:03] morning amen we shall rise up like the
[58:08] Morning
[58:10] Star is that amen and we shall shine
[58:13] again in the brightness because
[58:17] morning speaks of
[58:20] strength amen every time you rise up in
[58:23] the morning we must rise up
[58:29] new death of the night all night speaks
[58:34] of
[58:36] death is that amen when we come to the
[58:40] night we Le down we take on the image of
[58:46] death is that amen we
[58:50] areed we are so weak is that amen but
[58:54] the Bible is telling us is the spirit
[58:58] that raise up Jesus Christ the spirit
[59:01] dwelleth into you church are we together
[59:05] like when we go to
[59:07] sleep there are people who never rise
[59:10] up why the
[59:13] spirit is not there if the spirit is
[59:17] there you may
[59:19] sleep spirit will Quicken you in the
[59:23] morning amen will tell you rise up it's
[59:29] a time to work the same thing if the
[59:33] spirit of Jesus Christ D inside of you
[59:38] the same way that Spirit R up Jesus
[59:41] Christ in the same way it will come and
[59:44] Quicken our
[59:46] bodies is that
[59:48] amen amen we may cry in the
[59:52] night we may we may grown in the night
[59:56] when the morning comes it brings a
[1:00:01] sunrise it brings a
[1:00:04] change and the angel will always point
[1:00:08] us to a living
[1:00:09] Jesus is that amen the
[1:00:13] messenger always point us to a living
[1:00:16] Jesus why are you looking for the
[1:00:19] living among us the dead he's not there
[1:00:25] is that amen we have heard but there is
[1:00:28] a resurrection
[1:00:29] morning when the angel of the Lord has
[1:00:33] got to come and wak us up arise is that
[1:00:38] amen get out of
[1:00:41] sleep amen so we know that in that
[1:00:44] Resurrection
[1:00:46] morning Mary was so
[1:00:50] sorrowful and the rest of the
[1:00:53] disciples they were so sorrowful
[1:00:57] they were
[1:00:58] crying some of them they were running
[1:01:02] away some were
[1:01:04] hiding some were just you know moving on
[1:01:07] the way
[1:01:08] talking amen but to each of them the
[1:01:13] greatest
[1:01:14] news was he is
[1:01:16] Reis he is reison and know their hopes
[1:01:20] were gathered
[1:01:22] together all their frustrations were
[1:01:25] gathered together
[1:01:27] he meets Mary just go and tell my
[1:01:31] disciples even Peter that I am alive and
[1:01:36] I will meet you is that amen and as we
[1:01:41] are walking on the
[1:01:42] way and they were
[1:01:44] frustrated where have they taken him
[1:01:46] everybody is saying he not here but when
[1:01:49] they were moving on the
[1:01:51] way what happens he comes amen
[1:01:56] and is's walking with them but they
[1:01:58] couldn't understand why for them they
[1:02:02] were taken with
[1:02:04] grief they were taken with a lot of
[1:02:08] sorrow and that's what always blackens
[1:02:11] our Resurrection
[1:02:14] morning is that amen it's the Tres that
[1:02:18] we have gone
[1:02:19] through it's the cha that we have gone
[1:02:23] through then we forget the word of God
[1:02:27] but the holy spirit always come and
[1:02:30] Quicken us to the
[1:02:33] reality is not
[1:02:35] dead amen and if he is not dead and we
[1:02:39] have got the same Spirit we shall rise
[1:02:42] up
[1:02:44] again amen know when he spoke to
[1:02:48] them about the resurrection he took them
[1:02:52] back to the
[1:02:53] Genesis brought them all through the
[1:02:55] scriptures
[1:02:57] walked with them talked with them and
[1:03:00] then he reaches a time he began speak of
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] present amen and the Bible says then you
[1:03:09] open their eyes and when their eyes were
[1:03:12] open they realized him amen and then
[1:03:16] they begin to say our
[1:03:20] heart bur within us as he walked with us
[1:03:26] spoke with us our
[1:03:29] hearts within us when we hear the
[1:03:33] gospel sometimes looks
[1:03:35] ordinary what is that burning in your
[1:03:39] soul amen is the resurrected Jesus
[1:03:42] speaking unto
[1:03:44] you amen it's not a dead Jesus it's a
[1:03:49] living Jesus every time he speaks unto
[1:03:53] you our hearts burn within us
[1:03:57] that enough to make us
[1:03:59] know that he is
[1:04:01] alive amen praise be to God the very
[1:04:06] beautiful and most beautiful
[1:04:09] morning was the
[1:04:13] resurrection
[1:04:14] amen all the
[1:04:17] saints of
[1:04:19] old they were promised to
[1:04:22] this they had a lot of blessings in the
[1:04:25] world
[1:04:26] you look at Abraham he had
[1:04:29] riches he had you know he had he had he
[1:04:32] had good life he had popularity he had
[1:04:36] all that God would give
[1:04:39] him the greatest
[1:04:42] thing when this life was
[1:04:45] over was for him to know that there is a
[1:04:51] resurrection is that amen and all of
[1:04:54] them
[1:04:56] when it came to the time of
[1:04:58] death God helped them to look beyond the
[1:05:04] B what we call looking past the C of
[1:05:08] time and when they
[1:05:11] looked they told their
[1:05:14] children me in
[1:05:17] can is that
[1:05:19] amen me in can and Abraham bought a
[1:05:23] portion
[1:05:26] they they had to BU all his
[1:05:29] people that's where his wife sah
[1:05:32] wased that's where he was
[1:05:35] bued that's where all the
[1:05:39] prophets amen they were said in
[1:05:43] can what were they looking at they were
[1:05:47] looking on the
[1:05:49] resurrection amen for them they were
[1:05:53] shown what Mary
[1:05:56] so that for them they were sh
[1:06:01] what
[1:06:03] that they were far
[1:06:06] back in Genesis
[1:06:09] 258 uh the Bible says talking about
[1:06:14] Abraham we can just speak a few
[1:06:18] things
[1:06:20] amen
[1:06:22] 8 Genesis 25 gen 25 vers
[1:06:34] 8 it says then Abraham gave up The Ghost
[1:06:38] and died in a good old
[1:06:41] age an old man and full of years and was
[1:06:45] GED his people

[1:10:09] place there was
[1:10:11] something that they knew about that
[1:10:15] barri amen you can be buried
[1:10:18] anywhere it's okay but here is talking
[1:10:22] about a
[1:10:24] resurrection why is talking unto

[1:10:41] bones in the promised land why because
[1:10:45] in there when the trumpet of God shall
[1:10:50] sound in Christ Jesus rise up again
[1:10:55] the place physically
[1:10:58] speaking the first
[1:11:00] resurrection are we together it took
[1:11:04] place in that very area where they
[1:11:07] were amen MTH 27 tells
[1:11:13] us
[1:11:16] 2 27 tells
[1:11:19] us about this Resurrection verse
[1:11:25] it
[1:11:30] says MTH 27:50
[1:11:36] okay says Jesus when he had cried again
[1:11:40] with
[1:11:42] voice up
[1:11:49] the and behold the veil of the temple
[1:11:52] was rent in twine from the top to the
[1:11:55] bottom and the Earth did quick and the
[1:11:58] Rocks
[1:12:07] rent and the graves were
[1:12:10] opened and many bodies of the
[1:12:13] Saints which slept
[1:12:16] Aros and came out out of the out of the
[1:12:21] graves after his resurrection
[1:12:25] went into the holy city and appeared to
[1:12:29] many is that amen so when these people
[1:12:32] were going
[1:12:34] away God was able to show
[1:12:37] them is that amen that if you want a
[1:12:42] resurrection you must be in a certain
[1:12:45] place amen and as
[1:12:48] Christians our
[1:12:50] Resurrection the Bible tells us we must
[1:12:54] be in Christ
[1:12:56] Jesus amen and every
[1:13:00] Christian never in your life whatever
[1:13:04] happens ever live this world without
[1:13:08] knowing about your
[1:13:10] Resurrection is that amen you must
[1:13:14] Ure make
[1:13:16] aen make an agreement with the Lord
[1:13:20] Jesus amen I must die in you
[1:13:25] why that's where the resurrection
[1:13:28] is is that amen everything that God
[1:13:33] gives us speaks about that
[1:13:36] Resurrection amen
[1:13:39] healing
[1:13:41] healing amen is an Evidence of
[1:13:45] Resurrection God gives us the
[1:13:49] things this body it can become so weak
[1:13:55] always fallen sick and when I fall sick
[1:13:59] always wonder how can the body rise up
[1:14:02] again from
[1:14:03] this it becomes so
[1:14:06] weak your hand becom so
[1:14:09] heavy your head becomes so heav
[1:14:12] everything becomes so
[1:14:14] complicated but God when he comes and
[1:14:18] heals you again and you forget about the
[1:14:21] pain what is speaking about
[1:14:25] about a change speaking about the power
[1:14:28] of
[1:14:29] God take away the pain that amen and the
[1:14:33] prophet says if there is no Divine
[1:14:36] Healing there is no
[1:14:39] Resurrection is that amen because if we
[1:14:42] fall sick we are ready to go and go but
[1:14:46] when he gives us back our
[1:14:48] heal gives us back our strength it's the
[1:14:52] same way amen that these weak bodies
[1:14:57] they shall be picked up again and they
[1:15:00] shall live
[1:15:03] again is that amen the healing of our
[1:15:06] bodies is an Evidence of
[1:15:11] Resurrection is that amen because it's
[1:15:14] so
[1:15:16] complicated sometimes we get
[1:15:18] broken amen when God comes and bus the
[1:15:23] body he says sign of
[1:15:27] Resurrection when we sleep and we are
[1:15:30] totally helpless and you don't know what
[1:15:32] is going on you are so
[1:15:35] silenced however powerful you are when
[1:15:38] you rise up again in the
[1:15:40] morning speaking about a
[1:15:42] resurrection amen sometimes we get so
[1:15:47] sorrowful until our hearts are
[1:15:50] breaking until you can't hold tears
[1:15:53] until you can't stand but when God comes
[1:15:56] down and heals your body and heals your
[1:16:00] soul and heals your heart and you can
[1:16:04] laugh again and you can walk again it's
[1:16:07] a sign of a resurrection but all the
[1:16:10] things that are here shall be
[1:16:13] changed is that amen are we
[1:16:17] together sometimes it looks like all
[1:16:20] this cannot go away any
[1:16:22] time how will this ever if God can heal
[1:16:26] your
[1:16:27] heart and heal your soul and change you
[1:16:31] then it's a sign that there is a
[1:16:36] resurrection is that amen if you
[1:16:39] remember those people God
[1:16:41] healed in the Bible many of them somewh
[1:16:45] in very terrible
[1:16:48] situation they had given up with them
[1:16:51] amen let's take an example of Lazarus
[1:16:55] he had a Min
[1:16:58] Resurrection is that amen that one was
[1:17:02] just was just an Evidence of the
[1:17:05] Resurrection I'm talking
[1:17:07] about is that amen because there that
[1:17:11] Resurrection where by the dead are given
[1:17:14] back their life but they are not
[1:17:17] changed is that amen but they raised up
[1:17:21] but they are not changed but that's an
[1:17:24] Evidence
[1:17:25] amen of the real great morning of
[1:17:32] Resurrection God can be able to raise
[1:17:34] you and bring you
[1:17:36] back into this body he is able to raise
[1:17:41] you into a glorious
[1:17:44] body is that amen
[1:17:47] Christians how greatest
[1:17:50] hope is
[1:17:52] that is that amen these bodies as they
[1:17:56] become
[1:17:58] weak know you grow begin to weaken the
[1:18:02] prop says around 22
[1:18:06] 23 you begin to come to the afternoon of
[1:18:09] your
[1:18:11] life is that amen death begins to Mark
[1:18:16] you amen it's marking you one step at a
[1:18:20] time it will begin to Mark you amen it
[1:18:25] will Mar you with a little rink on the
[1:18:28] face but it's coming against you it will
[1:18:32] you with a gray
[1:18:34] hair coming against you it will you with
[1:18:37] the shoulders getting you know
[1:18:41] stoed bying against you it will bend
[1:18:44] your back amen scanning against
[1:18:49] you together but the greatest thing that
[1:18:53] was ever given to
[1:18:56] is a
[1:18:57] resurrection a change of this body it
[1:19:01] will go back to the
[1:19:04] original and why do we
[1:19:06] live why do we live we want a good
[1:19:11] Doctrine that's okay but have we ever
[1:19:14] thought about the
[1:19:18] resurrection is that amen after all the
[1:19:22] good Doctrine is over
[1:19:25] after all the
[1:19:27] blessings
[1:19:30] Miracles and wonders the Christian is
[1:19:33] able to look at the
[1:19:36] resurrection amen like the
[1:19:39] way looked he looked for food like any
[1:19:43] other
[1:19:45] person Jacob looked for
[1:19:48] blessings we look for
[1:19:50] them is that amen he had to steal them
[1:19:55] where it meant he had to go and work and
[1:20:00] heed he looked for food like the way we
[1:20:04] do at the end of The
[1:20:07] Journey he tells his son Sarto me that
[1:20:13] you not bu me in
[1:20:17] egpt whatever it
[1:20:19] is swear that you will not die in the
[1:20:23] world

[1:20:27] life

[1:20:33] for you but you should not be buried in

[1:21:01] not be bured in riches you must be
[1:21:04] buried in him who is the
[1:21:08] resurrection is that amen because he
[1:21:11] told
[1:21:12] M I am the
[1:21:15] resurrection when he came
[1:21:18] Lazarus amen when Lazarus was
[1:21:21] dead mother said if you had been here
[1:21:25] my brother would not
[1:21:26] have and mother
[1:21:29] said and Jesus said your brother
[1:21:35] again
[1:21:37] been in her church she already said I
[1:21:41] know he will rise up
[1:21:44] again when at the resurrection morning
[1:21:49] but Jesus
[1:21:50] said I am the resurrection
[1:21:54] was it the future was now in the present
[1:21:59] the resurrection you are looking at
[1:22:02] already started and how does it start he
[1:22:06] said where have you
[1:22:07] bued said amen where have you bued him
[1:22:11] and they took him to the Grave they said
[1:22:13] it is already
[1:22:15] stinking he said no something has got to
[1:22:19] be done if you believe that Lazarus will
[1:22:22] rise up in the resurrection then you
[1:22:26] must believe
[1:22:27] today that amen that the same God is not
[1:22:32] in the future he is in the present if
[1:22:36] you believe that you rise up again you
[1:22:40] must believe for the healing of your
[1:22:44] body is that amen which is
[1:22:48] greater which is
[1:22:50] greater is in the resurrection of the
[1:22:52] body and the healing of your body

[1:24:10] grief take away all the things of the
[1:24:13] falling and is the same
[1:24:17] God everything that's happening today is
[1:24:20] a
[1:24:21] shadow of the Resurrection
[1:24:26] is that amen you've got somebody who has
[1:24:31] backing your child or
[1:24:33] whatever and you are praying God I want
[1:24:37] my children to be in the
[1:24:38] resurrection I want my brother to be in
[1:24:40] the resurrection I want my mother to be
[1:24:42] in the resurrection you can pray for
[1:24:45] them for that
[1:24:47] Resurrection I am I am the
[1:24:52] resurrection comes in the
[1:24:55] present confirm what is going to happen
[1:24:57] in
[1:24:58] the
[1:25:00] amen where have you buried
[1:25:03] him sometimes we say the stone is too
[1:25:06] big amen where have you put him you are
[1:25:10] dealing with him that that that is the
[1:25:13] mass of all the
[1:25:17] impossibility amen the prophet says says
[1:25:21] give me that plain gospel
[1:25:24] in
[1:25:26] Simplicity that will make me believe the
[1:25:30] resurrection is that amen the simple
[1:25:34] Gospel of believing the word of
[1:25:37] God is what we need is that amen
[1:25:41] sometimes we are complicating
[1:25:43] things the resurrection is not is not an
[1:25:46] act of
[1:25:51] psychology that
[1:25:54] of theology knowing a
[1:25:57] lot it's not even an act of having a lot
[1:26:00] of these things and
[1:26:02] whatever
[1:26:04] believe that he that you have believed
[1:26:09] is that amen if situations have
[1:26:11] changed go and tell
[1:26:14] Peter go and tell my
[1:26:16] disciples
[1:26:19] even alive
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:24] said amen I'm going to handle this
[1:26:28] situation because there's something
[1:26:31] greater if I've been able to lay down my
[1:26:35] life I'm more than able to raise you
[1:26:39] up do you love the Lord amen so the
[1:26:43] Bible tells us for those that are in
[1:26:46] Christ
[1:26:48] Jesus will God bring with
[1:26:51] him is that amen is where you
[1:26:57] are are you in Christ Jesus are you
[1:27:01] rooted inside
[1:27:02] there that's where we must
[1:27:06] stand amen and the greatest
[1:27:10] crown that was given to the ministry of
[1:27:13] Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ was a
[1:27:18] resurrection is that amen if he had
[1:27:21] preached
[1:27:24] people and done
[1:27:26] everything and he never rose up
[1:27:29] again that was the greatest
[1:27:35] flow but the greatest Crown he
[1:27:39] had Amen in
[1:27:42] Revelations
[1:27:44] 118 I am
[1:27:46] he I am he but was dead and I am now
[1:27:52] alive amen I am not only alive but I
[1:27:56] have got the
[1:27:57] keys of hell and the grave I am more
[1:28:02] than able open for you he has got the
[1:28:06] keys the keys of death is that amen if
[1:28:11] he didn't rise up
[1:28:13] again we would be one of the miserable
[1:28:17] People First Corinthians
[1:28:20] 1512 let see what Paul says about it
[1:28:32] First Corinthians
[1:28:34] 152 says now if Christ be preached that
[1:28:38] he rose from the dead how say some among
[1:28:41] you that there is no resurrection of the
[1:28:51] Dead is that amen the person you are
[1:28:56] believing the person you are been
[1:28:57] baptized
[1:28:58] into they are saying he rose up then why
[1:29:02] do some people say no resurrection of
[1:29:05] the dead but if there be no resurrection
[1:29:08] of of the dead then is Christ not
[1:29:15] Ren and if CHR be not reason then is our
[1:29:19] preaching Vain and your faith is also
[1:29:22] vain
[1:29:32] this why it should be
[1:29:33] emphasized our preaching will be
[1:29:36] vain also your faith is vain if Christ
[1:29:42] really the one we talk
[1:29:44] about heed
[1:29:47] 5000 he just you know walked on the
[1:29:49] water he just did Miracles and he never
[1:29:53] rose up again
[1:29:55] do you see it should be emphasized he
[1:29:58] rose up and if you Rose up I'm preaching
[1:30:03] now has got hope and your faith has got
[1:30:06] something
[1:30:07] solid is that amen understand that amen
[1:30:12] you may say I may not understand it
[1:30:15] because Christ Rose I Rise up
[1:30:19] again I not preach the doct maybe very
[1:30:22] well but because he
[1:30:26] reason you love the Lord yeah and we are
[1:30:31] wi of God because we have testified of
[1:30:34] God that he raised up Christ whom he
[1:30:37] raised not up if so be the dead rise not
[1:31:04] amen for if the dead rise not then is
[1:31:07] not Christ
[1:31:08] reisen and if Christ be not raised your
[1:31:11] faith is vain ye are yet in your sins
[1:31:28] amen yeah the very evidence of his
[1:31:32] resurrection the very real understanding
[1:31:35] that he rose up
[1:31:37] again and that's the person that you are
[1:31:42] trusting that the will
[1:31:46] up is that amen we who are still living
[1:31:51] here you know we we we are going to
[1:31:54] partake of the
[1:31:57] Rapture amen we shall be changed in a
[1:32:01] moment but I want to tell you the
[1:32:06] greatest thing is a
[1:32:08] resurrection because all the saints of
[1:32:12] The Seven
[1:32:15] Ages
[1:32:17] amen those that are sleeping they are
[1:32:21] more the saints that are living today
[1:32:25] is that amen so the rure the change of
[1:32:28] the body will be for very few
[1:32:31] people the resurrection is for the
[1:32:34] greatest
[1:32:37] number is that amen yes because it's
[1:32:41] pertaining only to the seven Church
[1:32:44] age and only to a small
[1:32:48] portion
[1:32:49] Resurrection discovering all the s that
[1:32:52] we are preached to by by
[1:32:56] them that came in the second
[1:32:59] age the fourthe Thee the 6 age they are
[1:33:04] all waiting and not only those even
[1:33:08] those in the 7 age that have rested they
[1:33:12] are also waiting and now what a date is
[1:33:15] going to be when the resurrection
[1:33:18] morning comes for
[1:33:21] the is that amen we see Paul we see not
[1:33:27] only those people but all the that were
[1:33:30] with them what going to be when we see
[1:33:34] our loved ones that have gone before us
[1:33:38] in this generation a resurrection
[1:33:41] morning is a wonderful
[1:33:44] morning is that amen it's the most
[1:33:47] glorious
[1:33:54] be
[1:33:54] assured that there is a
[1:33:57] resurrection amen and the Bible says
[1:34:01] unless those people rise up we shall not
[1:34:04] also be
[1:34:06] changed yes the Bible says the trumpet
[1:34:10] of God shall
[1:34:12] sound and them that have died in Christ
[1:34:17] shall raise
[1:34:19] up then we which are living shall be
[1:34:25] changed is that amen so that
[1:34:28] Resurrection it has got a Rapture inside
[1:34:31] of
[1:34:32] it amen of the
[1:34:35] de you love the
[1:34:38] Lord It's a change of the body it's a
[1:34:41] wonderful thing let's take the gospel
[1:34:45] serious amen because as we live here the
[1:34:49] only thing that we can hold on
[1:34:54] of all things is a
[1:34:57] resurrection if there's no
[1:34:59] Resurrection our faith is
[1:35:05] in is that
[1:35:07] amen the
[1:35:10] Lord
[1:35:12] 14
[1:35:14] verse he a
[1:35:20] question job 141

[1:37:17] things they have a
[1:37:19] resurrection the trees have a
[1:37:20] resurrection

[2:02:02] lives that all is now possible may the
[2:02:07] good Lord bless
[2:02:08] you amen we are looking for his
[2:02:13] coming the resurrection
[2:02:16] morning amen and when the Lord comes
[2:02:19] here we shall be like him
[2:02:22] this body is here that limited by
[2:02:27] space limited by
[2:02:32] matter when we rise up we shall be like
[2:02:36] him are still
[2:02:38] talking he comes he was not
[2:02:42] lied while he was in the
[2:02:44] body they would wait for
[2:02:48] him when the sea was becoming troubled
[2:02:54] but when he rose up before they before
[2:02:57] before they could think he was already
[2:02:59] there and he would go he doesn't need
[2:03:03] a is that Amen in that body is a very
[2:03:07] wonderful
[2:03:08] time a very glorious
[2:03:13] body upon that may the good Lord bless
[2:03:19] you amen am shalom shalom we shall be

[2:03:32] you have you been blessed
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:54] praise the
[2:03:59] Lord so we are very
[2:04:04] excited if the spirit that Rose Christ
[2:04:06] from the dead dwells in
[2:04:09] you he Quicken your mot
[2:04:12] bodies he's already on the side of
[2:04:16] you so I would rather
[2:04:18] say you are caring the resurrection
[2:04:21] power with you all the
[2:04:26] time amen so it starts from the
[2:04:30] inside that's where our Resurrection
[2:04:32] begins
[2:04:34] from because we know about the double
[2:04:37] portion the inside must be
[2:04:40] quickened if the inside is
[2:04:43] quickened by the BM of the
[2:04:46] Holy whether the body wants or it
[2:04:49] doesn't want when the time comes it will
[2:04:53] follow in the
[2:04:55] resurrection because Paul says and you
[2:04:59] as
[2:05:00] quickened who were dead in sin and
[2:05:04] trespasses even when you were dead in
[2:05:07] sins has he quickened us so
[2:05:11] potentially we are quickened we are
[2:05:14] changed
[2:05:15] people we are on a
[2:05:17] journey we may be wounded here and there
[2:05:21] I want tell you that at the end of The
[2:05:25] Journey the brother says it shall be
[2:05:29] there so the same power of the
[2:05:33] Resurrection that dwells in you is the
[2:05:36] same power that quickens your inner
[2:05:40] man when you feel like you have
[2:05:43] slackened in your Christian
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:49] Life your Revival
[2:05:52] is also a sign of the
[2:05:55] Resurrection that I may know
[2:05:58] him in the power of his
[2:06:01] resurrection this power of the
[2:06:04] Resurrection this power the forces of
[2:06:09] backsliding that always tries to cow
[2:06:12] into our
[2:06:14] lives amen so what are you looking for
[2:06:19] are you looking for the living from
[2:06:21] among the
[2:06:23] dead why do you keep yourself among the
[2:06:27] dead amen so we live a separate
[2:06:32] life in preparation for our body
[2:06:37] change we are separated
[2:06:40] people for the Master's
[2:06:43] use so the call is come out of my
[2:06:48] people amen and be separate

[2:07:27] but you will not and the brother told us
[2:07:31] you tell the devil I'm holding on the
[2:07:34] power of the
[2:07:36] Resurrection amen whether the storms
[2:07:40] strike or the earthquakes
[2:07:43] hit amen let me show you something here
