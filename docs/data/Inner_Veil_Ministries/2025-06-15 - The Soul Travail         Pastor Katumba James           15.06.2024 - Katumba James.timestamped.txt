[40:12] Take my love, my lord.
[40:17] Thy po
[40:20] at thy feet
[40:24] in trees
[40:26] store.
[40:28] Take
[40:30] myself
[40:32] and I will be
[40:37] ever
[40:39] all
[40:40] [Music]
[40:42] for thee.
[40:47] Take
[40:49] myself
[40:51] and I will be
[40:56] ever
[40:58] all
[41:02] for thee.
[41:05] [Music]
[41:08] Amen.
[41:12] Amen.
[41:14] Pastor, you're welcome.
[41:23] God bless you.
[41:25] I said God bless you.
[41:29] Amen. Amen.
[41:32] Now I feel you are still around.
[41:36] So we appreciate God for this morning
[41:41] who has been gracious to us
[41:44] and bring us to the house of the Lord
[41:46] this morning.
[41:48] Amen. This is the best place to be.
[41:52] [Music]
[41:53] Amen. We come to the house of the Lord
[41:57] with praises and thanks.
[42:00] Amen. Amen. You see, you don't come down
[42:03] here and feel like you died yesterday,
[42:08] but you come down here to tell the devil
[42:11] you got some eternal life in you.
[42:14] Amen. When you want to say amen, you say
[42:17] real.
[42:20] Amen. You see, we need to come down here
[42:25] and catch some bit of fire.
[42:31] Amen. Amen. If there is some kind of a
[42:33] cold shoot,
[42:36] Holy Spirit can warm.
[42:40] Amen. We pick from one another. That's
[42:42] how the candles were lit.
[42:45] Amen. From this candle to this candle,
[42:48] this candle to this candle. That's why
[42:51] we come to church. Amen. Because
[42:53] everybody brings a leak of fire.
[42:57] Amen. to light up your brother.
[43:00] If somebody came in and his spirit was
[43:03] down, you can lift him up. When the
[43:07] pastor is having a hard time,
[43:10] when you say amen, he can go through the
[43:13] junction.
[43:15] That's what we are here for. So I
[43:17] appreciate God so much. Who has been
[43:21] gracious to my life.
[43:24] Amen. I want to tell you one thing.
[43:27] that there is one thing that's near to
[43:31] you
[43:34] that is called
[43:37] is very near
[43:39] and your being alive
[43:42] is the grace of God.
[43:46] Amen. Amen. So when we present ourselves
[43:49] in his presence,
[43:52] we are thanking him for the great
[43:55] Amen. Amen. It's been a long time.
[43:59] I've been on the run.
[44:01] Immediately after the meetings here and
[44:04] on the handover,
[44:07] I had uh dedication of the church.
[44:12] I got to preach in one convention again
[44:16] and then went over to Dodma.
[44:20] And Dodma, we had a weekend of meetings.
[44:26] But when I came back, you know, I felt
[44:29] so exhausted.
[44:32] I drove from the airport back here.
[44:35] But the following day, I just couldn't
[44:39] understand me.
[44:41] Amen. There was no pain,
[44:45] but
[44:46] I was not alive.
[44:49] Amen. When I would want to stand up and
[44:52] go this left,
[44:56] My legs take me right
[44:59] and now they would ask me what's your I
[45:01] said I'm feeling nothing
[45:05] but I was depreciating depreciating
[45:10] to the extent that I could not feed
[45:12] myself.
[45:15] Amen. We give thanks to God. We took the
[45:19] tests.
[45:21] Amen. We took the tests.
[45:24] But there was nothing in the body.
[45:28] It was just an exhausted body.
[45:31] Amen. Amen. You see the body one time
[45:34] can say no.
[45:39] You've used me so much.
[45:42] I'm ready to pack.
[45:45] Amen. Amen. So in the year 2000,
[45:49] I experienced something very similar to
[45:52] that.
[45:54] I went for meetings
[45:57] with my daughter peace.
[45:59] We left on Thursday.
[46:02] We went to
[46:05] and then we preached f Friday,
[46:09] Saturday, Sunday we moved further and
[46:13] then I preached on Tuesday,
[46:16] Wednesday went further, you know, and I
[46:20] took quite a number of services
[46:24] and then I drove back
[46:26] about 600 kilometers
[46:29] by morning. I could not get out of the
[46:32] bed.
[46:34] And when I tried to get up,
[46:38] I could not lift my feet off the ground.
[46:42] I had to drag my feet.
[46:45] I want to say something. When a minister
[46:48] comes down here to speak to you, it is a
[46:52] sacrifice.
[46:54] [Applause]
[46:58] You know, you don't just stand up there
[47:00] and watch him and, you know, and figure
[47:04] him out.
[47:07] Enter into the service with him.
[47:09] Just be like a John who said, "I was in
[47:13] the spirit on the Lord's day.
[47:16] Get in the same spirit.
[47:18] Let the Lord feed us."
[47:21] I appreciate our pastor and the way you
[47:24] pastor. I mean supporting you.
[47:28] You see when you are running the really
[47:34] whoever you hand the battle to
[47:37] is expected to be faster than you
[47:42] and I trust that brother James
[47:45] will be faster than the speed we've been
[47:47] used.
[47:49] Let's just stand behind him. Brother
[47:53] says, "If another person has the ball,
[47:58] you just stand around and protect him."
[48:01] So, let's stand behind our pastor,
[48:04] protect him in our prayers,
[48:07] protect him in our presence.
[48:10] Amen. When he calls for meetings,
[48:14] we shall be here. Is that amen? Amen.
[48:19] So, I certainly appreciate you.
[48:22] for those who were able to come
[48:25] and uh those who cared to call
[48:29] but mostly all of you pray.
[48:32] May God bless you. Bless you so much.
[48:36] Amen. Let's just enjoy the service.
[48:39] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[48:42] Amen. And keep the services alive.
[48:47] Amen. God bless you.
[48:50] your bless.
[48:52] Let us clap for our pastor.
[48:55] [Applause]
[49:02] Amen. We thank God for his grace.
[49:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Just keep
[49:08] him in your prayers.
[49:11] He's going into again another series of
[49:13] convention.
[49:16] Immediately after the meetings on
[49:18] Sunday,
[49:20] we'll be going to Maza with brother
[49:22] Andreas
[49:24] Andreas for also meetings there in
[49:26] Tanzania.
[49:27] We just keep on praying for him and even
[49:30] the services of the Lord ahead of us.
[49:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[49:37] stand up
[49:39] and then we get into
[49:41] the reading of the word.
[49:51] Let us pray. Father, we want to thank
[49:54] you for your love, grace, and mercy.
[49:58] And we appreciate for the healing of our
[50:00] pastor
[50:03] is bring him back safely. Lord
[50:06] Lord we commit him into your hands
[50:09] even for the meetings in mana
[50:12] together with brother Andreas
[50:14] that Lord you may use them in such a
[50:16] special
[50:18] we commit all the burdens still before
[50:20] us into your hands
[50:23] father you may give strength and
[50:25] guidance
[50:27] for the glory and horn of your name
[50:30] we commit all the needs of the children
[50:32] of God also into your hands
[50:35] grace may abound in everything.
[50:38] And now as we got the opening of the
[50:40] word,
[50:41] may you come and speak to us
[50:44] and help us to get the mind of God
[50:48] concerning the things that the spirit
[50:49] will be speaking to us.
[50:52] We may be able to be obedient
[50:55] and fulfilled that you've called us to
[50:57] do. We love you, Lord, and we thank you,
[51:00] Lord.
[51:01] In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray
[51:03] and ask this.
[51:05] Amen. Amen. Let us go to Isaiah 53.
[51:11] Isaiah chapter 53.
[51:16] And I feel like we need to read the
[51:17] whole chapter
[51:23] from verse one to verse 12.
[51:28] And then our subject is soul travel.
[51:37] So he says verse one, who has believed
[51:42] our report? And to whom is the arm of
[51:45] the Lord revealed?
[51:55] For he shall grow up before him as a
[51:58] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[52:01] ground. He has no form nor comeliness.
[52:04] And when we shall see him, there is no
[52:06] beauty that we should desire him.
[52:26] He is despised and rejected of men, a
[52:29] man of sorrows and acquainted with
[52:32] grief, and we hid as it were our faces
[52:35] from him. He was despised and we
[52:38] esteemed him not.
[52:42] Sure.
[52:58] Surely he has borne our griefs and
[53:01] carried our sorrows. Yet we did
[53:03] estimate.
[53:10] [Music]
[53:21] But he was wounded for our
[53:23] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[53:25] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[53:28] peace was upon him. And with his stripes
[53:30] we are healed.
[53:46] All we like sheep have gone astray. We
[53:48] have turned everyone to his own way. And
[53:51] the Lord has laid upon him the iniquity
[53:54] of us all.
[54:08] He was oppressed and he was afflicted
[54:11] yet he opened not his mouth. He is
[54:13] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[54:16] as a sheep before her shearers is
[54:17] dumped. So he opens not his mouth.
[54:42] He was taken from prison and from
[54:44] judgment. And who shall declare his
[54:47] generation? For he was cut off out of
[54:49] the land of the living. For the
[54:51] transgression of my people was he
[54:54] stricken.
[55:19] And he was he has made his grave with
[55:22] the wicked and with the rich in his
[55:25] death. Because he had done no violence,
[55:28] neither was any deceit in his mouth.
[55:45] [Music]
[55:47] Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[55:50] He has put him to grief. When thou shalt
[55:54] make his soul an offering for sin, he
[55:57] shall see his sin. He shall prolong his
[56:00] days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[56:02] prosper in his hand.
[56:25] He shall see of the travel of his soul,
[56:28] and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge
[56:31] shall my righteous servant justify many,
[56:34] for he shall bear their iniquities.
[56:56] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[56:58] with the great, and he shall divide the
[57:00] spoil with the strong, because he has
[57:03] poured out his soul unto death, and he
[57:06] was numbered with the transgressors and
[57:08] bear the sin of many and made
[57:11] intercession for the transgressors.
[57:48] So I want to share on soul travel.
[57:58] Praise the name of
[58:01] you know that kind of you know pain one
[58:04] goes through because of a particular
[58:06] situation.
[58:11] Praise the name of the Lord. So here the
[58:13] Bible is telling us
[58:16] that Christ went into a soul travel,
[58:22] you know, because of the sin.
[58:26] Praise the name of our Lord. And we know
[58:28] that Christ
[58:30] was God coming in flesh.
[58:34] Praise the name of our Lord. You see,
[58:35] when you look at the Genesis record
[58:40] that God made man in his own image,
[58:46] Praise the name of our Lord. In Genesis
[58:48] chapter one, he made man as a spirit
[58:51] man.
[58:54] Then that spirit man, he put a body on
[58:58] him
[58:59] in Genesis chapter 2.
[59:02] And then you see that when God was
[59:04] making the nature
[59:07] or when he was making the living thing,
[59:11] when he made animals,
[59:13] he made the male and the female.
[59:17] But now when he made the human being,
[59:20] he made Adam.
[59:23] Praise the name of our Lord. He didn't
[59:25] make him with Eve immediately,
[59:29] but then he he took Eve the woman out of
[59:33] the man.
[59:36] Praise the name of Allah. That was the
[59:39] purpose of God.
[59:41] But in one way there was way how sin
[59:45] would get into the human race
[59:50] and sin entered by the serpent
[59:54] you know deceiving the woman
[59:57] and then eating of the fruit of the tree
[1:00:00] which was not right to do.
[1:00:04] We see that when the f the fall came in
[1:00:07] the garden of Edith.
[1:00:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Brother
[1:00:12] teaches us at every time of redemption,
[1:00:18] God would come down himself.
[1:00:22] Praise the name of God. So even here
[1:00:25] they used to have fellowship in the
[1:00:27] garden of Eden,
[1:00:30] in the cool of the dead. Praise the name
[1:00:33] of Lord. But then this time when God
[1:00:37] came to the place of fellowship,
[1:00:41] he didn't get there Adam.
[1:00:43] And then you can see what sin can also
[1:00:46] do to us.
[1:00:49] Is that when sin gets a hold of us,
[1:00:53] it makes us lose direction.
[1:00:58] When sin gets a hold of you, it makes
[1:01:01] you afraid to come to church.
[1:01:04] When sin gets a hold of you, it makes
[1:01:07] you be afraid to meet a brother or a
[1:01:09] sister.
[1:01:12] When sin gets a hold of you, it makes
[1:01:15] you lose your desire for fellowship.
[1:01:20] Instead of coming in the services of the
[1:01:22] Lord,
[1:01:24] you know, you you completely kind of
[1:01:26] lose your track.
[1:01:29] You kind of hide yourself.
[1:01:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Sorry, I'm
[1:01:34] recognizing brother Benjamin. You can
[1:01:36] stand up. Brother Benjamin Barza. I'm
[1:01:39] sorry I forgot.
[1:01:41] Let us receive him.
[1:01:44] I'm sorry. I was meant to introduce him
[1:01:46] here before the service.
[1:01:49] He's a son to brother Barasa
[1:01:54] and he has come to inform us about his
[1:01:56] marriage.
[1:01:59] So let us give him our support.
[1:02:02] You're most welcome our brother. I'm
[1:02:04] sorry for that. You may sit down.
[1:02:07] Brother, you're also welcome.
[1:02:10] Amen. Amen. So now sin can always take
[1:02:15] us away from fellowship.
[1:02:19] And that's what really happened in the
[1:02:20] garden of Eden.
[1:02:24] You know, God had come in the cool of
[1:02:26] the day
[1:02:28] to fellowship with Adam.
[1:02:31] But now when he reached in that place,
[1:02:34] they were not there.
[1:02:37] And then the Bible says that they heard
[1:02:39] the voice of God walking in the garden
[1:02:44] and then they hid themselves.
[1:02:47] They were afraid of God.
[1:02:50] And now you see the consequence of sin
[1:02:51] here.
[1:02:53] When they ate of the fruit, they
[1:02:56] realized they were naked.
[1:02:59] And now because you know the veil had
[1:03:02] been brought torn apart.
[1:03:05] So when they realized that they were
[1:03:07] naked
[1:03:09] and there were only two people in the
[1:03:11] garden,
[1:03:14] a man with his wife
[1:03:17] But when they realized that they were
[1:03:19] naked,
[1:03:21] they were ashamed of their nakedness.
[1:03:24] But then here you don't people don't
[1:03:26] care
[1:03:29] walking on the streets when they are
[1:03:30] naked.
[1:03:34] But these were husband and wife
[1:03:38] only in the garden.
[1:03:41] And when they found they naked,
[1:03:44] they try to put fig leaves around
[1:03:45] themselves.
[1:03:48] And then here you find people walking on
[1:03:50] the streets not caring that they are.
[1:03:54] So that shows that people are in a
[1:03:56] terrible condition,
[1:03:59] completely fallen.
[1:04:02] Somebody leaves home halfdressed
[1:04:06] and then they don't have any shame at
[1:04:08] all.
[1:04:10] But Adam, Adam with Eve, they felt
[1:04:14] ashamed
[1:04:16] until they put fig leaves around
[1:04:17] themselves.
[1:04:19] But the covering of the fig leaves
[1:04:23] which depicts a religion
[1:04:26] was not sufficient to cover their naked
[1:04:30] until when they heard the voice of God.
[1:04:33] They felt that they are not covered.
[1:04:36] They went and hid themselves in the
[1:04:38] trees.
[1:04:41] And then God called them, "Adam, Adam,
[1:04:43] where are you?"
[1:04:45] Adam. And then Adam said, "I'm here."
[1:04:49] We we are afraid
[1:04:51] because we are naked.
[1:04:55] You know, Adam
[1:04:57] was right away confessing his situation.
[1:05:03] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:05:05] know, sometimes sin can get a hold of
[1:05:07] you.
[1:05:09] And then you feel you are not adequate.
[1:05:13] You say, "Lord have mercy upon me."
[1:05:17] But now if you refuse to confess,
[1:05:21] you'll find that you become hardened in
[1:05:23] your heart.
[1:05:25] The heart of Adam was not yet hardened.
[1:05:31] and the true elect of God.
[1:05:34] Your heart will not be hardened
[1:05:37] when you sin.
[1:05:39] Praise the name of our Lord. Your heart
[1:05:40] will not be hardened
[1:05:42] when you sin. That was Adam. Oh, we are
[1:05:47] naked.
[1:05:48] So, we afraid to come in your presence.
[1:05:51] We felt we are inadequate.
[1:05:54] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[1:05:56] see, God is so gracious.
[1:06:00] God himself had to come down
[1:06:04] and sacrifice an animal.
[1:06:07] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:06:09] covered their nakedness.
[1:06:12] God brought the solution
[1:06:15] for their deliverance.
[1:06:17] And right there when God was was
[1:06:20] actually kind of removing their sins,
[1:06:25] he promised about the woman se
[1:06:29] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Sin will
[1:06:35] always take a lot of pain.
[1:06:39] And you know sin, the Bible says in the
[1:06:42] book of Romans chapter 3.
[1:06:47] Romans chapter 3 and verse 23.
[1:06:51] For all have sinned and come short of
[1:06:53] the glory of God.
[1:07:06] And then in Romans chapter 6
[1:07:10] and then verse 23
[1:07:14] it says for the wages of sin is death
[1:07:20] but the gift of God is eternal life
[1:07:23] through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:07:29] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:07:31] the wages of sin,
[1:07:35] what comes out of sin
[1:07:38] is death. And now that's how the whole
[1:07:42] human race started coming after the
[1:07:44] fall.
[1:07:48] We were all born in sin
[1:07:52] and shaped in iniquity.
[1:07:55] So now God had to create another way
[1:08:00] how we can be born again.
[1:08:03] Praise the name of our Lord. He had to
[1:08:05] make a way.
[1:08:07] How we can be born again. The way he
[1:08:10] made the way of shadows in the Old
[1:08:12] Testament
[1:08:15] whereby they used the animal blood
[1:08:19] to cover their sins. And this was
[1:08:22] fulfilled by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:25] when he shed his blood for our sins.
[1:08:29] Now you see that Christ
[1:08:31] here in Isaiah chapter 53,
[1:08:34] Isaiah prophesies
[1:08:37] about how Christ
[1:08:40] had to carry the sin of God.
[1:08:43] How Christ had to be smitten,
[1:08:47] how Christ had to be stripped.
[1:08:51] And then he said by his stripes we are.
[1:08:55] And so you see that Christ
[1:08:58] had traveled.
[1:09:01] Praise the name of travel in his body.
[1:09:06] His life he lived on earth was not
[1:09:08] pleasant
[1:09:11] from the time of his birth.
[1:09:13] Born from in a poor family.
[1:09:16] Even there was no room in the in the in
[1:09:18] the manger for him or in the inn for
[1:09:20] him.
[1:09:22] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:09:24] they looked everywhere.
[1:09:26] There was no admission of Christ
[1:09:30] until he was born in actually a manger.
[1:09:34] You know everything about him
[1:09:38] was painful through his life.
[1:09:42] A man of sorrows.
[1:09:44] Praise the name of God. And all this was
[1:09:47] painful
[1:09:49] because of our sin,
[1:09:52] because of our redemption.
[1:09:55] Praise the name of our Lord. So he came
[1:09:57] and lived on earth
[1:10:00] until he was saying. Praise the name of
[1:10:02] our Lord that you know the foxes have
[1:10:05] holes,
[1:10:08] the birds have nests,
[1:10:11] but the son of man has no house.
[1:10:16] Everything about him
[1:10:19] was just given.
[1:10:22] You can imagine God borrowing a womb to
[1:10:26] be born.
[1:10:29] Praise the name of our Lord. God in
[1:10:32] human flesh.
[1:10:34] Even borrowing a grave to be buried in.
[1:10:40] It was a travel.
[1:10:43] a soul travel
[1:10:45] for our redemption.
[1:10:47] And now we are also called upon
[1:10:52] to see that those who are not saved,
[1:10:57] we also need to have soul travel for
[1:10:59] them.
[1:11:01] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:11:03] have soul travel
[1:11:06] for the friends who are in sin.
[1:11:09] We need to have soul travel
[1:11:11] for our children who are not yet born
[1:11:13] again.
[1:11:15] We need to have soul travel
[1:11:17] for our parents who are not born again.
[1:11:20] We need to have soul travel for the
[1:11:23] neighbors who are not born again.
[1:11:26] We need to have soul travel for the
[1:11:29] wickedness that we see down in the city.
[1:11:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:11:35] to the book of Ezekiel.
[1:11:39] Chapter 9 verse one.
[1:11:44] The Bible says, "He cried also in mine
[1:11:47] ears with a loud voice, saying, cause
[1:11:50] them that have the charge over the city
[1:11:54] to draw near, every man with his
[1:11:57] destroying weapon in his hand.
[1:12:15] And behold, six men came from the way of
[1:12:18] the higher gate, which lith toward the
[1:12:21] north, and every man a slaughter weapon
[1:12:25] in his hand. And one man among them was
[1:12:28] clothed with linen with a writer's ink
[1:12:32] by his side. And they went in and stood
[1:12:35] beside the present altar.
[1:13:09] And the glory of God of Israel was gone
[1:13:13] up from the cherub where upon he was to
[1:13:16] the threshold of the house and called to
[1:13:19] the man clothed with linen which had the
[1:13:22] right ink by his side.
[1:13:43] And the Lord said unto him, "Go through
[1:13:46] the city,
[1:13:48] through the midst of Jerusalem, and set
[1:13:50] a mark upon the forehead of them that
[1:13:54] sigh and cry for all the abomination
[1:13:58] that be done in the midst thereof.
[1:14:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Like here
[1:14:20] we live in Ginger.
[1:14:23] Are we concerned about the wickedness
[1:14:25] that is done in our place?
[1:14:30] Praise the name of the Lord because it's
[1:14:32] a place that we live in.
[1:14:34] And you know when God sent the children
[1:14:36] of Israel to Babylon,
[1:14:39] he told them, "Pray for the peace of the
[1:14:42] city."
[1:14:44] That in the peace of the city,
[1:14:47] you shall have peace.
[1:14:50] So are we concerned about the condition
[1:14:54] of the places that we live in?
[1:14:58] Praise the name of our Lord. the
[1:14:59] condition of the people.
[1:15:02] Maybe you live in a place and there are
[1:15:04] so many drunkers.
[1:15:07] From every neighborhood there is a
[1:15:09] drinking point, a drinking point, a
[1:15:10] drinking point.
[1:15:14] How much have you done about that
[1:15:16] condition in that place?
[1:15:20] Or you are living maybe in a place where
[1:15:22] you are renting
[1:15:24] and then you find a neighborhood all
[1:15:26] prostitutes houses.
[1:15:31] You know something so evil.
[1:15:34] You know how what have you done about
[1:15:37] that?
[1:15:38] Are you taking time to pray and cry to
[1:15:41] God?
[1:15:43] The way the Bible is telling us that go
[1:15:47] out in the city
[1:15:49] and make a mark upon the forehead
[1:15:53] of the men that sigh and cry
[1:15:58] against the abominations that are done
[1:16:00] in the city
[1:16:03] or you are not concerned about what's
[1:16:05] happening in your life.
[1:16:07] So you need to have a soul travel.
[1:16:11] Say Lord have mercy.
[1:16:14] Maybe it is in your family.
[1:16:17] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:16:18] know like there are some families who
[1:16:20] have kind of you know things which
[1:16:22] almost resemble and happen which are not
[1:16:24] good.
[1:16:28] Some families you find there is always
[1:16:30] suicide.
[1:16:33] Some families you find there is
[1:16:34] something people becoming mad.
[1:16:38] Some families you find people just
[1:16:40] become prostitutes.
[1:16:43] Some families you find die before a
[1:16:45] certain age.
[1:16:48] And now if you are in that family,
[1:16:52] God has saved you. Have you taken
[1:16:55] interest
[1:16:56] to cut down that kind of situation from
[1:16:59] happening again
[1:17:02] or you are not concerned?
[1:17:04] Praise the name of God. You know, you
[1:17:06] need to be concerned
[1:17:09] about what is happening around you.
[1:17:13] Be concerned about what's happening in
[1:17:15] your place of work.
[1:17:18] Be concerned about what's happening in
[1:17:20] the community that you live in.
[1:17:23] Be concerned about what's happening in
[1:17:26] your family. you know the conduct of
[1:17:29] your children,
[1:17:31] you know the behavior,
[1:17:33] people going after things which are
[1:17:35] strange.
[1:17:37] So we need to have a soul tra
[1:17:41] a burden that is in us
[1:17:44] for the souls that are lost.
[1:17:47] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:17:49] message the inside man
[1:17:52] he says
[1:17:55] you would like to know what I think the
[1:17:57] greatest need of the church is today.
[1:18:03] Would you like
[1:18:05] what I think
[1:18:08] where I think is lacking is
[1:18:14] no soul travel.
[1:18:21] Praise the name of the Lord. You know,
[1:18:23] like when you get saved,
[1:18:26] you think that's enough.
[1:18:29] But last Sunday, we read
[1:18:32] and then brother Brham was telling us
[1:18:35] that Christianity
[1:18:38] moves from one individual to another
[1:18:40] individual.
[1:18:44] That's how we got ourselves salvation.
[1:18:48] Praise the name of Lord. I'm happy
[1:18:50] sister Agat has come with somebody
[1:18:51] today.
[1:18:54] Let us for her. Praise the name of Lord.
[1:18:57] How about us?
[1:19:00] We had seven days through the week.
[1:19:03] How many have you talked to about
[1:19:04] Christ?
[1:19:08] I didn't get time. I was too busy.
[1:19:12] How many people have you conversed with
[1:19:14] through the week?
[1:19:16] But this week my mouth was shut.
[1:19:20] That's not possible. But in the midst of
[1:19:22] all your conversation,
[1:19:25] how many people have you talked to about
[1:19:28] this?
[1:19:31] We can start taking record of ourselves.
[1:19:35] You know, brother Brandham told us that
[1:19:38] if you have not brought anybody to
[1:19:41] Christ,
[1:19:43] you are barren.
[1:19:46] and being buried is not pleasant.
[1:19:50] How many have you brought to Christ?
[1:19:54] Praise the name of our Lord. How many
[1:19:56] have you talked to about Christ through
[1:19:57] the week?
[1:20:00] You know, you don't stop. You keep on
[1:20:03] talking to them, encouraging them.
[1:20:07] Praise the name of the Lord. So, he says
[1:20:09] the problem we have today,
[1:20:12] the need we have today,
[1:20:15] is we have no soul traveled.
[1:20:20] The people are not broke up enough.
[1:20:25] There is no burden seemingly
[1:20:29] and you give me someone that's just to
[1:20:31] up lost souls.
[1:20:42] They are just they just cry
[1:20:46] and wanting a revival so bad
[1:20:50] till they can hardly eat
[1:20:54] just ugly can't.
[1:20:57] Praise the name of Lord. Then he says,
[1:20:59] if you read the history of the world
[1:21:02] and the religious history,
[1:21:05] you'll find out it always taken that
[1:21:07] kind of a spirit
[1:21:11] to bring a revival.
[1:21:13] People to turn to God,
[1:21:16] people to repent of their sins.
[1:21:19] Praise the name of the Lord. Until
[1:21:21] people can be afraid to do funny things
[1:21:22] in your neighborhood
[1:21:26] because there is the fear of God.
[1:21:30] Praise the name of Allah. So we need to
[1:21:32] see that our souls travail for the lost
[1:21:35] people.
[1:21:38] Be concerned about the people who are
[1:21:40] not saved.
[1:21:42] Be concerned about your children who are
[1:21:44] not saved.
[1:21:46] Be concerned about your parents who are
[1:21:48] not saved.
[1:21:50] Be concerned about your colleagues.
[1:21:53] You know, some of them they are your
[1:21:54] best friends.
[1:21:56] They can tell you every secret. But have
[1:21:59] you taken interest
[1:22:02] to tell them about the salvation of
[1:22:03] Jesus?
[1:22:05] Have you taken interest to tell them
[1:22:08] that the Lord has sent us a message
[1:22:12] that prepares us for the rapture?
[1:22:15] We need to have a soul travel.
[1:22:19] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[1:22:22] here he says,
[1:22:25] you get around where there's arguments,
[1:22:29] you get into that type of atmosphere.
[1:22:33] If there's something in the church,
[1:22:36] someone who is disobedient
[1:22:38] and they they very ugly acting in the
[1:22:41] church and causing trouble,
[1:22:45] You'll never be able to have a revival
[1:22:47] as long as that kind of atmosphere is
[1:22:48] around.
[1:22:52] If you will notice when the Holy Spirit
[1:22:56] came on Pentecost,
[1:22:58] they were all in one place
[1:23:02] in one accord.
[1:23:05] That is right waiting for the promise.
[1:23:10] There has to be a burden.
[1:23:13] A burden about the salvation of your
[1:23:14] children.
[1:23:16] A burden about the salvation of your
[1:23:18] colleagues.
[1:23:20] A burden about the salvation of your
[1:23:21] friends.
[1:23:23] A burden about the salvation of your
[1:23:25] neighbors.
[1:23:27] Let them see your life. Even the
[1:23:30] testimony of your mouth.
[1:23:33] You know, you are telling them there is
[1:23:35] a better way to live.
[1:23:38] Praise the name of Lord. Like you know
[1:23:40] there are some things which are not
[1:23:41] pleasant to hear.
[1:23:44] People fighting
[1:23:47] a husband and a wife fighting
[1:23:50] or this all this order in a family.
[1:23:55] You know those are not pleasant things
[1:23:56] to hear.
[1:23:59] So now we need to see that we have a
[1:24:02] burden.
[1:24:04] Praise the name of our Lord to pray that
[1:24:06] people can be changed
[1:24:09] and then be turned to the Lord. Praise
[1:24:12] the name of our Lord. You know we need
[1:24:14] to see that we get a burden in
[1:24:16] ourselves.
[1:24:18] We have a travel.
[1:24:20] A trial of the lost soul.
[1:24:24] A travel of your children.
[1:24:27] travel of your neighbors
[1:24:30] or the people you work with
[1:24:33] so that you can see the gospel of Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ
[1:24:38] going out to them.
[1:24:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:24:43] message perseverant
[1:24:47] says we have lost the interest
[1:24:51] of really of souls.
[1:24:59] that soul travel
[1:25:02] that the Christian ought to have.
[1:25:06] We seem to lose it.
[1:25:09] I'm not talking about
[1:25:12] I'm not talking about the real
[1:25:14] Christians.
[1:25:16] I'm talking about so many that profess
[1:25:18] to be Christians.
[1:25:22] Now if you are a real Christian,
[1:25:26] you must have that soul travel.
[1:25:29] Praise the name of our Lord, testifying
[1:25:31] about the Lord.
[1:25:33] You know, seeing that people can know
[1:25:38] the gospel, what you believe, what your
[1:25:42] faith is, you are not ashamed to be
[1:25:46] identified with what you believe.
[1:25:49] You are testifying about it.
[1:25:51] You are telling people to turn away from
[1:25:53] their evil ways
[1:25:55] to bring them to Christ. And then he
[1:25:57] says, "All you hear today is some big
[1:26:00] something."
[1:26:04] You know, some big something
[1:26:06] going to expenses of millions of dollars
[1:26:09] for great things
[1:26:13] and then preaching that the Lord is
[1:26:15] coming in this generation.
[1:26:18] Why? The sinner on the street
[1:26:22] knows you don't believe it.
[1:26:25] Your actions speak louder than your
[1:26:27] words.
[1:26:30] When you do that, we ought to be from
[1:26:32] house to house,
[1:26:35] from place to place, preaching,
[1:26:39] crying,
[1:26:40] begging, persuading,
[1:26:44] trying to get every soul
[1:26:47] into the kingdom of God.
[1:26:50] Sending missionaries east, west, and
[1:26:52] south,
[1:26:55] everything we can do to get people
[1:26:58] saved.
[1:26:59] Then let us come back to ourselves. What
[1:27:02] have we done as individuals?
[1:27:06] Praise the name of you already have an
[1:27:08] audience all the time with you
[1:27:11] at your place of work.
[1:27:14] Maybe where you go to buy things.
[1:27:17] You even take time to negotiate and
[1:27:19] things like that.
[1:27:22] How about talking about Christ to these
[1:27:24] people,
[1:27:26] telling them the Lord loves
[1:27:29] telling them what you're doing is wrong.
[1:27:31] Telling them you need to get saved.
[1:27:34] Praise the name of Lord. How about the
[1:27:37] people you interact with?
[1:27:40] You know, testifying to them,
[1:27:43] your neighborhood,
[1:27:45] praise the name of our Lord or even
[1:27:47] where you study from,
[1:27:49] you know, testifying to them about the
[1:27:51] goodness of the Lord.
[1:27:54] Then he says now we find today
[1:27:58] it is so much on decisions.
[1:28:01] You hear that all time
[1:28:06] making decisions.
[1:28:08] Decisions on decisions are confessions.
[1:28:12] Confessions are stones.
[1:28:15] What does it do? Pile up a bunch of
[1:28:18] stones.
[1:28:20] If you've if you have not got stone
[1:28:23] cutter there
[1:28:25] who can shape them in the shape of
[1:28:27] two-edged sword
[1:28:33] of of God into sons and daughters of
[1:28:36] God.
[1:28:39] them run around here with all kinds of
[1:28:42] women dressed and skinned down whiner
[1:28:52] and call themselves Christians and then
[1:28:55] letting men do that
[1:28:57] calling themselves servants of Christ
[1:29:00] and the church in the lukewarm formal
[1:29:02] condition
[1:29:05] that is in a form of godliness.
[1:29:10] but denying the power thereof
[1:29:14] and calling decisions.
[1:29:16] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:29:19] see that we have a tra
[1:29:23] for the salvation of the people we live
[1:29:25] with.
[1:29:27] Praise the name of our Lord, the people
[1:29:28] we work with, the people we find around.
[1:29:33] There are people who come to work for
[1:29:35] you.
[1:29:36] Have you told them about Christ? There
[1:29:39] are people you work with. Have you
[1:29:41] testified about Christ to them?
[1:29:45] Like I remember that that maid
[1:29:49] in Syria,
[1:29:51] she was taken as a captive from Israel.
[1:29:57] She had no hope to go back. And when she
[1:30:00] saw her master npress,
[1:30:05] she told the mistress
[1:30:08] that there is a prophet in Israel
[1:30:11] who can heal this man. How about us?
[1:30:15] There's a prophet God has sent in this
[1:30:17] generation.
[1:30:19] There is a message of the hour and then
[1:30:22] you see your friends in leprosy,
[1:30:26] you know, just doing false baptism,
[1:30:31] false conduct,
[1:30:33] false living
[1:30:36] all over. You told them we have B in
[1:30:40] Gilead.
[1:30:43] The message of the hour is the bomb in
[1:30:46] Gilead which can cure the leprosy that's
[1:30:49] affecting people.
[1:30:52] Spiritual leprosy.
[1:30:54] You testify to them. It is a message of
[1:30:57] the hour.
[1:30:59] God wants you to dress right. God wants
[1:31:02] you to live right. God wants you to see
[1:31:05] that you you take up the things of the
[1:31:08] word.
[1:31:10] There is a prophet. There is a message
[1:31:14] that the Lord has given out to us. How
[1:31:16] much interest have you taken to testify?
[1:31:20] We have a message of the hour preparing
[1:31:23] us for the rapture,
[1:31:25] preparing us for the coming of the Lord.
[1:31:28] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:31:30] have a soul travel.
[1:31:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the
[1:31:36] message questions and answers,
[1:31:39] he says,
[1:31:44] I'll give you my estimation
[1:31:48] of what I think is the closest thing to
[1:31:51] an evidence that a man is a Christian
[1:31:58] than anything I know of.
[1:32:02] You know what it is? It's a travel
[1:32:06] of soul. A person that is always
[1:32:10] hungering
[1:32:14] and thirsting for God,
[1:32:17] they just simply
[1:32:22] day and night.
[1:32:25] They can't stand it.
[1:32:28] There is a continuous burden.
[1:32:32] You are in prayer. You are in
[1:32:34] testifying.
[1:32:36] You are in reading the word of God.
[1:32:38] No, it is something that you are
[1:32:39] burdened.
[1:32:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:32:44] says
[1:32:48] they are full of love
[1:32:50] and they are just a soul travel
[1:32:55] just travailing all the time.
[1:32:59] The Bible say he that goes forth sowing
[1:33:02] in tears
[1:33:04] will doubtless return again
[1:33:09] rejoicing
[1:33:11] bringing in the sheets.
[1:33:14] Now look what
[1:33:16] if this church
[1:33:18] if I would say this morning in this
[1:33:20] little group of people
[1:33:24] and then he said God said now look
[1:33:28] William Brham
[1:33:30] I'm going to make you answer for that
[1:33:32] group of people
[1:33:34] what you tell them now what do you want
[1:33:37] them all all to shout
[1:33:41] I want them to shout do you You want
[1:33:44] them all to speak with tongues?
[1:33:47] I want every one of them too.
[1:33:50] You want them all to dance in the
[1:33:51] spirit. I want every one of them too.
[1:33:55] All right. Well, that is very good. But
[1:33:58] what would you rather have them to do?
[1:34:03] I would rather have a church
[1:34:06] that had a burden on their heart
[1:34:11] for prayer that they just stayed at this
[1:34:14] altar
[1:34:16] and would be here day and night
[1:34:19] and everything else and in their house
[1:34:24] was constantly in prayer
[1:34:27] and humble and trying to get the people
[1:34:30] to come.
[1:34:33] and making calls at the hospital,
[1:34:37] visiting the sick and trying to get the
[1:34:39] people to come to church
[1:34:42] and do right. I'd rather have that than
[1:34:45] all the other put together.
[1:34:51] Although the other is right,
[1:34:54] it belongs to the church. Praise the
[1:34:56] name over see how brother Brandham is
[1:34:58] bringing it out

[1:35:53] to pass.
[1:35:55] You can pray for the sick and they get
[1:35:57] healed.

[1:36:01] Christ being in you.
[1:36:04] Praise the name of Lord. If some if one
[1:36:06] of your colleagues is sick,
[1:36:09] why don't you say I let me pray for you?
[1:36:12] Why don't you use some of those
[1:36:14] promises?
[1:36:16] You lay your hand on your colleague or
[1:36:18] your fellow students or anybody else and
[1:36:22] say, "Let me pray for you, my friend.
[1:36:24] Let me pray for you, my sister. You
[1:36:26] honestly pray for them.
[1:36:29] And that could be an open door to
[1:36:30] witness to them about Christ.
[1:36:34] And then you see people opening up. You
[1:36:37] know, at home, we have a worse traction
[1:36:38] than what I've done. And then you see

[1:37:07] there is something which happened
[1:37:11] that they called the pastor to pray for
[1:37:13] those people
[1:37:15] and when the pastor prayed for those
[1:37:17] people
[1:37:18] and that person was delivered
[1:37:21] The whole family accepted the message
[1:37:25] and about 30 people were baptized in
[1:37:27] that day.
[1:37:29] There are doors you can use
[1:37:33] to bring people into Christ.

[1:39:05] these people. You got people just in
[1:39:07] confusion.
[1:39:09] They don't know which way to go.

[1:39:14] situation. Use that power to help those
[1:39:18] people. Praise the name of our Lord,

[1:39:59] you know. It just catches the fish.
[1:40:04] It causes people to be attracted
[1:40:08] that that one can pray for you.
[1:40:11] That one can help you. And then people
[1:40:14] come Use that to talk them about Christ.

[1:40:55] but if I had to have it
[1:40:58] I would put that first
[1:41:01] cuz if you've got that
[1:41:03] the others will take place.
[1:41:07] Praise the name of our Lord. you know a
[1:41:09] hungering.
[1:41:12] If you just get so hungry for God,
[1:41:16] praise the name of the Lord. Then you
[1:41:18] see what the Lord can do.
[1:41:21] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go
[1:41:23] to Matthew chapter 5.
[1:41:28] Matthew chapter 5
[1:41:33] and then we read in verse six.
[1:41:37] The Bible says,
[1:41:39] Blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[1:41:41] after righteousness, for they shall be
[1:41:44] filled.
[1:41:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Hungering
[1:41:53] and thirsting.
[1:41:56] He says hunger and thirst
[1:42:00] should be something in us.
[1:42:03] Lord save this person.
[1:42:06] And then you can put them before the
[1:42:08] Lord in prayer
[1:42:11] really interceding for them
[1:42:14] like our Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible
[1:42:17] says in making intercession for sinners.
[1:42:22] Why he makes sure that each of us
[1:42:27] who is in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] none is lost.
[1:42:32] You should also be able to stand there.
[1:42:36] stand in the gap.
[1:42:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Say, Lord,
[1:42:41] come and help these people. Come and
[1:42:43] deliver these people. Come and save
[1:42:46] these people.
[1:42:48] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:42:50] see that we stand in that God.
[1:42:53] Brother Brandham had a vision
[1:42:56] in the message paradox.
[1:43:00] You know, he was walk
[1:43:07] And then he was walking with the brother
[1:43:10] and then in the bush there was something
[1:43:11] which was making noise
[1:43:15] and then he wondered what is this. Then
[1:43:17] he saw a mamba coming out
[1:43:21] and said this is instant death.
[1:43:25] And then when it was coming towards him,
[1:43:28] it stopped. Like there was a power that
[1:43:30] was stopping it.
[1:43:32] Then it went after the person was moving
[1:43:37] and then he cried Lord have mercy upon
[1:43:41] it kills him
[1:43:43] is instant death.
[1:43:45] Let us call that message paradox.
[1:43:49] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:43:54] He said
[1:44:03] and then I come into a vision again.
[1:44:07] It seems that I was lifted up
[1:44:12] sitting on a highway,
[1:44:15] a narrow highway
[1:44:18] with some brother and I never knew who
[1:44:20] the brother was.
[1:44:22] I looked around and I said now I'm sure
[1:44:28] and know this is a vision
[1:44:32] the Lord is here
[1:44:35] and seemed like somebody
[1:44:38] was afraid
[1:44:40] and I say what's everybody so afraid of
[1:44:45] and the voice came and said
[1:44:48] there is such a danger these
[1:44:52] There is a great hideous thing
[1:44:59] that is death
[1:45:02] when it strikes you.
[1:45:05] And we've read the wages of sin is
[1:45:09] death. So there's a condition of sin
[1:45:14] that seems to take a hold of people
[1:45:19] just bound
[1:45:21] and they can't help themselves
[1:45:24] just in chains.
[1:45:27] You find somebody's bound in a condition
[1:45:32] in year out
[1:45:36] and they don't have the joy of their
[1:45:37] salvation.
[1:45:39] They are totally bound.
[1:45:42] They can't overcome.
[1:45:45] They have not enough power in themselves
[1:45:47] to overcome.
[1:45:49] And that's what sinners are.
[1:45:52] They don't like the things they are
[1:45:54] doing. But they find themselves they are
[1:45:57] bound
[1:45:59] you know they just bound
[1:46:01] just like Samson
[1:46:04] bound. You know when they took away his
[1:46:07] eyes
[1:46:08] and they put chains on his legs, he was
[1:46:11] just bound
[1:46:13] and then they would make him make play
[1:46:14] for us a spot.
[1:46:17] And Satan can do the same thing to
[1:46:19] somebody's life
[1:46:24] up.
[1:46:26] So then he says, "And I heard the wheat
[1:46:30] smashing down
[1:46:34] and I looked and here come a huge
[1:46:37] monster snake
[1:46:40] through the woods."
[1:46:43] I thought now knowing this is a vision.
[1:46:48] Then I see what this animal or beast is
[1:46:54] and he crawled up on the highway.
[1:46:57] And as soon as I got sight of him,
[1:47:00] I knew it was a mamba. Now, a mamba is
[1:47:04] an African snake,
[1:47:08] which is the most deadly bite of all
[1:47:10] that there is.
[1:47:15] And then here it was on the highway.
[1:47:18] I thought, well, this is it. So I looked
[1:47:22] at the animal
[1:47:25] and he looked angry at me
[1:47:28] and he licked his tongue
[1:47:30] and he he here he come.
[1:47:33] When he got right close to me,
[1:47:37] he wouldn't run up fast
[1:47:40] and then he wouldn't and then he would
[1:47:41] get slower and slower
[1:47:44] and just quiver and stop and then
[1:47:47] something would hold him off.
[1:47:51] He couldn't bite me. And then he would
[1:47:54] turn around on the other side
[1:47:56] and try to approach from this other
[1:47:58] side. And then he would get back and get
[1:48:02] started
[1:48:04] right towards me and then get slower
[1:48:09] and then stop and then just shake off
[1:48:11] like that and move back. He couldn't
[1:48:14] strike me. Then he turned and looked at
[1:48:17] my friend
[1:48:20] and away he went after my friend
[1:48:25] sin. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:48:28] you see the way the Bible says
[1:48:30] that when Satan tempted Jesus Christ,
[1:48:34] he left him for a season. And that's
[1:48:37] what sin does
[1:48:39] coming.
[1:48:42] But to find out how protected are you,
[1:48:47] It goes
[1:48:49] and then it comes back.
[1:48:51] Praise the name of keeps on coming
[1:48:55] trying to find a time when you are not
[1:48:58] protected.
[1:49:01] If your protection
[1:49:03] and certainly our protection is the word
[1:49:05] of God.
[1:49:08] Now in the time when you are doubting
[1:49:10] the word of God,
[1:49:12] sin can take a hold of you because sin
[1:49:16] is unbelief.
[1:49:18] Your dedication to God,
[1:49:21] your prayerful life and then you just
[1:49:24] put it down
[1:49:27] and now this time when it comes
[1:49:29] it can take a hold of you. So you need
[1:49:32] to see that you are serious
[1:49:36] in the things that pertain to God.
[1:49:39] your reading of the word, your hearing
[1:49:42] of the word, your obedience of the word,
[1:49:46] you know, your dedication,
[1:49:48] your time into prayer,
[1:49:51] your time into fasting
[1:49:54] and you see when you continue in this
[1:49:56] vision,
[1:49:58] you know, brother Brandham was told by
[1:50:00] God,
[1:50:02] you can bind this
[1:50:05] or even worse of even all those worse
[1:50:08] than this.
[1:50:16] But the condition was
[1:50:20] you must be more sincere,
[1:50:24] your personal life now.
[1:50:26] Will they believe your testimony?
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:34] But you're the one smoking. You're not
[1:50:36] you're not delivered yourself.
[1:50:39] How they believe your testimony.
[1:50:41] If they find the things they do
[1:50:44] is what you're also doing
[1:50:48] the
[1:50:50] one who bearing false witness
[1:50:55] helped you. They can't believe your
[1:50:56] testimony.
[1:50:58] God told brother brother you must be
[1:51:01] more sincere
[1:51:05] if you're going to bind this and that's
[1:51:07] the same thing if we are going to help
[1:51:10] people
[1:51:12] if we are going to bring people to
[1:51:14] salvation
[1:51:16] let our lives
[1:51:19] shine that light
[1:51:22] that in the neighborhood
[1:51:24] if I'm a young man if I'm a young woman
[1:51:29] in the neighborhood.
[1:51:31] Let other parents desire their children
[1:51:33] to be like me.
[1:51:36] How I wish my son was like this. How I
[1:51:39] wish my daughter was like this. Because
[1:51:41] they are seeing there's a different life
[1:51:42] in you.
[1:51:45] And when they they admire you,
[1:51:49] it will not be difficult for you
[1:51:52] for them to allow you to befriend those
[1:51:54] people and turn them to Christ.
[1:51:58] Praise the name of our he says you must
[1:52:00] be more sincere
[1:52:04] if you are going to bind this.
[1:52:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Now here he
[1:52:11] goes further
[1:52:13] and then he turned around and looked at
[1:52:15] my friend
[1:52:18] and went after my friend
[1:52:21] jumping up in the air
[1:52:23] over him and over him and over him
[1:52:25] trying
[1:52:27] striking at him. I thought if he ever
[1:52:32] hits him, it is instant death. No wonder
[1:52:36] everybody is so scared
[1:52:39] because when the thing hits you
[1:52:42] is instant death. And it was striking at
[1:52:46] him like and I threw my hands up.
[1:52:50] God have merc upon my
[1:52:54] serpent ever strikes him
[1:52:57] to kill him. Saul traveled. Amen.
[1:53:02] He saw his brother being struck by
[1:53:04] Satan.
[1:53:06] and he travailed in his heart. He
[1:53:09] interceded for him. Lord have mercy upon
[1:53:13] my brother. Lord deliver my brother.
[1:53:16] Abraham.
[1:53:18] When God told him about the impending
[1:53:20] destruction of Sodom,
[1:53:24] Abra didn't say
[1:53:26] went away from us.
[1:53:30] I will let him suffer there.
[1:53:34] He had a burden in his heart
[1:53:37] about the saving
[1:53:39] of Lord and his property and said, "Oh
[1:53:43] God, you are righteous.
[1:53:45] Can you destroy the city
[1:53:48] when there are 50 righteous people?"
[1:53:51] He said, "No." And the number kept on
[1:53:53] coming down
[1:53:55] until at 10.
[1:53:58] Abraham said there was nobody reaching
[1:54:00] 10.
[1:54:02] He interceded.
[1:54:04] He had a soul travel.
[1:54:07] We should not have the same thing.
[1:54:10] Praise the name of God. So travel for
[1:54:12] your family.
[1:54:14] Travel for your friends. So travel for
[1:54:16] your neighborhood. Lord save this one.
[1:54:20] Lord deliver this one. And brother
[1:54:23] Brandham says if you are a true
[1:54:25] Christian, you'll always have that
[1:54:27] burden.
[1:54:29] You not be pleased people doing wrong
[1:54:31] things.
[1:54:33] This is their time to pay.
[1:54:35] No, remember them in prayer. Intercede
[1:54:39] for them. Lord, come and deliver this.
[1:54:43] Like brother was crying, Lord have mercy
[1:54:46] upon my
[1:54:49] serpent would not strike him
[1:54:52] but was striking his brother.
[1:54:55] There should be the same concern with
[1:54:56] us.
[1:54:58] Praise the name of God. Oh my sister.
[1:55:02] I don't know why she doesn't come to
[1:55:04] church with
[1:55:06] you her best friend.
[1:55:09] Are you concerned about her condition?
[1:55:13] I think maybe she got a problem.
[1:55:16] Why don't you take interest?
[1:55:19] Sister, why haven't you been coming?
[1:55:23] Like we can look around there are many
[1:55:26] who are not here in church today.
[1:55:29] Are we concerned?
[1:55:31] What is their condition?
[1:55:34] Do we have that soul traveled?
[1:55:37] You know this sister has not been
[1:55:38] coming. You know this brother has not
[1:55:40] been coming. Do you take interest?
[1:55:44] How are you? What is your condition?
[1:55:48] You missed church today.
[1:55:51] Are you fine? or you reach out to them
[1:55:54] where they are. So travel being
[1:55:57] concerned about your brother
[1:56:00] being your brother's keeper.
[1:56:03] It is Kane who said I'm not my brother's
[1:56:05] keeper.
[1:56:06] But we are not Kane
[1:56:08] in the name of Abraham was concerned
[1:56:12] about Lot. How about you? Are you
[1:56:16] concerned about your brother? Are you
[1:56:18] concerned about your sister?
[1:56:21] You know in church here many times we we
[1:56:24] have particular places we sit in
[1:56:28] now we look on this side where is my
[1:56:29] neighbor
[1:56:32] I don't know what happened maybe next
[1:56:33] Sunday she'll come
[1:56:35] have s travel for her
[1:56:38] brother why didn't you come to church
[1:56:40] what's happening to you if you have a
[1:56:42] challenge let me commute you in the
[1:56:45] prayer
[1:56:47] praise the name of our lord so
[1:56:51] be concerned about that one.
[1:56:54] I heard that the brother had a problem
[1:56:56] at a place of work.
[1:56:58] I know that a sister has a problem at
[1:57:01] our home.
[1:57:03] All the children are see
[1:57:06] this kind of trouble. See that you start
[1:57:09] with one another
[1:57:11] having a feeling for one another.
[1:57:14] Praise the name of so brother
[1:57:17] so travel for this brother.
[1:57:20] And then he cried to the Lord, "Lord
[1:57:23] have mercy." And then he said, "And just
[1:57:27] then the serpent turned to me
[1:57:30] when I said that and looked at me again,
[1:57:34] you know what sin likes,
[1:57:37] what Satan likes is to allow that person
[1:57:40] to completely get lost."
[1:57:44] Praise the name of our Lord. There is
[1:57:46] what brother Brham says. that there was
[1:57:49] a condition in the church
[1:57:54] and then one brother said
[1:57:56] let that rasco go.
[1:58:02] We are tired of him. That's a bad
[1:58:05] condition.
[1:58:08] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us be
[1:58:10] concerned
[1:58:12] who has not come to church today. Maybe
[1:58:15] there's a problem. Brother, I'm calling
[1:58:18] you. I want to find out what has
[1:58:20] happened to you. Sister, I'm calling
[1:58:22] you. I want to find out what has
[1:58:24] happened to you. Take an initiative.
[1:58:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Bisting one
[1:58:30] another.
[1:58:31] Take interest praying for one another.
[1:58:34] How will you pray for somebody if you
[1:58:36] don't know so much about them?
[1:58:39] You have no burden, no much feeling
[1:58:42] about them.
[1:58:44] So you cannot exactly address their need
[1:58:47] before God.
[1:58:50] But if you can visit them, our brother
[1:58:52] is in this condition. Our sister is in
[1:58:55] this condition. If you start
[1:58:57] interceding,
[1:58:59] Lord keep my brother. Lord deliver my
[1:59:02] brother. Lord set him free.
[1:59:06] We need to have soul traveled.
[1:59:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[1:59:12] the king
[1:59:14] had that Daniel,
[1:59:18] let us go to the book of Daniel. We
[1:59:19] shall come back to this spot.
[1:59:23] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:59:25] When the king had about Daniel
[1:59:29] that his enemies had made sure that they
[1:59:32] put him in the lion's den
[1:59:37] in Daniel 6 verse 16.
[1:59:50] Okay, let us start from D from Daniel
[1:59:52] chapter 6 verse14.
[1:59:56] Then the king when he heard these words
[1:59:59] was so displeased with himself and set
[2:00:03] his heart on Daniel to deliver him and
[2:00:06] he labored till the going down of the
[2:00:08] sun to deliver him.
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:23] You know, because there was a law
[2:00:26] that anybody who doesn't worship
[2:00:30] the king,
[2:00:33] he should be thrown in the lion's den.
[2:00:36] And here they find Daniel praying to
[2:00:38] God.
[2:00:40] And they had put that law to catch
[2:00:42] Daniel.
[2:00:45] So now the king comes to knowledge.
[2:00:50] They made him sign things he didn't
[2:00:51] understand.
[2:00:54] And now they are forcing him. Put Daniel
[2:00:57] in the lion's den.
[2:01:00] And the Bible says the king labored.
[2:01:06] There are some things you can try to do
[2:01:07] in the physical.
[2:01:10] But as much as you try, you can't go
[2:01:13] through.
[2:01:16] Until it was coming to the close of the
[2:01:18] day.
[2:01:20] Then the enemies of Daniel came to the
[2:01:22] king
[2:01:24] and told him, "No, oh king.
[2:01:27] The law of medicine and patience
[2:01:29] does not change."
[2:01:35] Then the king commanded that Daniel is
[2:01:36] put in the lion's den.
[2:01:40] Now you see the king, he said, "Then the
[2:01:41] king spoke to Daniel."
[2:01:44] Verse 16,
[2:01:47] "Thy God though serveth continually, he
[2:01:50] will deliver you.
[2:02:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Thy God you
[2:02:02] serve continually
[2:02:06] will deliver you.
[2:02:08] That was the confession of the king.
[2:02:11] But this king stop at that.
[2:02:16] We went and visited the brother.
[2:02:19] We gave him some we prayed for.
[2:02:22] I think he will be well. The rest of the
[2:02:24] week you have not called to find out how
[2:02:25] the brother
[2:02:28] that was not the king.
[2:02:30] He knew God will deliver
[2:02:34] demonstrate what he believed.
[2:02:37] That night there was no music in the
[2:02:40] palace.
[2:02:42] That night there were no wine in the
[2:02:46] palace.
[2:02:48] The palace was in a sorrowful mood.
[2:02:52] There was a soul travel in these
[2:02:57] musicians maybe had come to show their
[2:02:59] talents.
[2:03:01] They told them the king is in praying
[2:03:03] and fasting.
[2:03:05] So every instrument was shut,
[2:03:09] every winary place was shut,
[2:03:14] everything. They said the king is
[2:03:18] interceding for Daniel.
[2:03:20] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:03:22] the Bible says in verse 18,
[2:03:26] then the king went to his palace and
[2:03:29] passed the night fasting. Neither were
[2:03:32] their instruments of music brought
[2:03:34] before him, and his sleep went from him.
[2:03:51] All his mind was on Daniel.
[2:03:55] Saul traveled.
[2:03:58] Praise the name of the Lord. We need to
[2:04:00] have the same thing for one another.
[2:04:04] You know the brother has a problem.
[2:04:07] Get into a soul, travel for that
[2:04:09] brother.
[2:04:11] You know there's a challenge at your
[2:04:12] home.
[2:04:14] Get into a soul travel for that
[2:04:15] challenge.
[2:04:17] Lord, come in this.
[2:04:20] Come and change the condition. Come and
[2:04:23] change the situation.
[2:04:25] Come and deliver.
[2:04:27] The Bible says the king took the whole
[2:04:30] night fasting,
[2:04:33] no music,
[2:04:35] no wine, no nothing pleased us. Even
[2:04:39] there was no sleep.
[2:04:42] The whole night was interceding.
[2:04:45] Lord be gracious. Lord be merciful.
[2:04:49] Like Jacob when he was going to meet
[2:04:52] Esau
[2:04:54] went into s traffic.
[2:04:57] He was afraid to meet his brother
[2:05:00] the whole night. He was calling on the
[2:05:03] name of the Lord.
[2:05:06] Jesus told me to go back.
[2:05:08] Now my children are ahead of me. My
[2:05:11] wealth is ahead of me. My resources are
[2:05:14] ahead of me.
[2:05:16] I don't know if they are going to be
[2:05:18] safe because he divided these things in
[2:05:21] groups.
[2:05:23] He said if finds the rest and kills them
[2:05:25] maybe this one will be safe.
[2:05:28] Then for him he came last
[2:05:31] but this time he had to wrestle with the
[2:05:34] angel of God.
[2:05:37] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:05:39] have such personal time
[2:05:42] presenting an issue before God.
[2:05:45] This is something that has troubled me
[2:05:46] for now.
[2:05:48] I can no longer hold it anymore.
[2:05:51] Like Hannah,
[2:05:54] she was barren. Praise the name of the
[2:05:57] Lord. And many years she was without a
[2:05:59] child.
[2:06:01] until one day the co wife provoked her
[2:06:06] and said I can't go back home I'm going
[2:06:10] to be at the temple she went into soul
[2:06:13] travel
[2:06:15] said Lord
[2:06:17] you promise praise the name of said Lord
[2:06:21] give me a child give me a child
[2:06:25] praise the name of the Lord so
[2:06:29] praise the name of the Lord we to also
[2:06:31] have soul travel
[2:06:33] for the salvation of the people around.
[2:06:36] We need to have soul travation
[2:06:39] of our children. We need to have soul
[2:06:41] tra for the salvation of our parents. We
[2:06:45] need to have soul travel for one
[2:06:47] another.
[2:06:49] Praise the name of you know the king
[2:06:52] spent the whole night
[2:06:55] praying and fasting.
[2:06:57] Nothing was pleased before him.
[2:07:00] Praise the name of the Lord. Nothing
[2:07:02] pleasant at all. And when the morning
[2:07:05] came,
[2:07:07] the king just rain
[2:07:10] and he went to the lion's den
[2:07:14] and cried out, "Oh Daniel,
[2:07:17] the Bible says in a lamentable voice,
[2:07:21] are you safe?"
[2:07:23] Praise the name of our Lord. And God had
[2:07:25] answered the king.
[2:07:28] Praise the name of us. I believe God
[2:07:30] will answer our prayers
[2:07:32] when we can go into soul travel for one
[2:07:34] another
[2:07:36] whereby you go and pick the brother.
[2:07:39] This my brother
[2:07:41] he was deceived.
[2:07:43] This my brother was taken away from
[2:07:46] church. This my brother was bound with a
[2:07:49] stress.
[2:07:51] Now he is back with us. Praise the name
[2:07:54] of we need to have soul travel
[2:07:57] and not condemn somebody
[2:08:00] that one now that one can never come
[2:08:02] back as long as still alive
[2:08:05] travail for him. Keep him in your
[2:08:08] prayers. Say Lord I intercede for my
[2:08:12] Lord I intercede for myself. Lord I
[2:08:15] intercede for my family. And then see
[2:08:17] the goodness of the Lord coming.
[2:08:20] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[2:08:22] have a soul travel.
[2:08:26] You are having that burden in
[2:08:30] one another.
[2:08:32] Praise the name of you know as a true
[2:08:34] Christian.
[2:08:35] You have the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[2:08:39] Spirit travails.
[2:08:43] Praise the name of the Holy Spirit
[2:08:46] travails.
[2:08:48] He causes us to travail
[2:08:52] interceding for one another.
[2:08:56] Lord be gracious in this
[2:08:58] be merciful in this.
[2:09:01] Come down and help us. Praise the name
[2:09:04] of our Lord. Let us go back to that
[2:09:06] message.
[2:09:09] Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[2:09:11] said, "And just the serpent turned when
[2:09:13] I said that
[2:09:16] and looked at me. And a voice came from
[2:09:18] above and said, "You have been given
[2:09:22] power
[2:09:23] to bind him or the worst or any."
[2:09:28] And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?
[2:09:34] What can we do about the sin affecting
[2:09:37] my brother?
[2:09:39] What can we do about the sin affecting
[2:09:41] our family?
[2:09:43] What can we do about the sin affecting
[2:09:45] our friends?
[2:09:48] And God said, "There is one thing you
[2:09:51] must do.
[2:09:54] You must be more sincere.
[2:09:57] You must be more sincere.
[2:10:01] Praise the name of the Lord. Sincerity,
[2:10:06] full obedience to the word of God.
[2:10:10] Yourself given into the word of God.
[2:10:13] The word you've heard
[2:10:15] is alive in your life. It has the power
[2:10:18] of transformation.
[2:10:20] Until you have the mind of God,
[2:10:23] what you speak can come to pass. Praise
[2:10:27] the name of because that's the church
[2:10:29] Christ is coming.
[2:10:32] He's coming for a church without spot,
[2:10:35] no wrinkle, no blemish.
[2:10:39] Praise the name of God. That's the
[2:10:41] condition he wants us in.
[2:10:43] the condition of being more sincere.
[2:10:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:10:51] says, "And when the voice had said,
[2:10:55] paragraph 73,
[2:10:58] you must be more sincere
[2:11:00] on what you are to do this."
[2:11:03] Then it left me. I was standing in the
[2:11:06] room.
[2:11:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:11:10] now I said Lord
[2:11:14] in this case of emergency right now
[2:11:18] before your spirit leaves me
[2:11:21] I don't know what to do
[2:11:25] then paragraph 76
[2:11:28] and I took the Bible and just pulled it
[2:11:32] open like that
[2:11:34] and lay my thumb laying on first
[2:11:37] Corinthians chapter 5.
[2:11:41] Let us go and read that scripture.
[2:11:45] 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[2:11:48] and then we can pick verse seven and
[2:11:51] verse 8.
[2:11:55] The Bible says, "Put out there for the
[2:11:59] old leaven that you may be a new lamp as
[2:12:02] you are unleavened. For even Christ our
[2:12:05] Passover is sacrificed for us.
[2:12:25] Now stood for sin
[2:12:28] le.
[2:12:32] So he says p out the old leaven
[2:12:38] that you may have the new lamp.
[2:12:47] you know without leaven.
[2:12:50] So even Christ our Passover
[2:12:54] is he sacrificed for us.
[2:12:56] So he's telling us how we can get rid of
[2:12:59] leaven.
[2:13:02] Bring your weakness under the blood of
[2:13:04] Jesus.
[2:13:06] Confess your fault. Lord have mercy upon
[2:13:09] you. Lord forgive me.
[2:13:13] Lord purify you. Bring your weaknesses
[2:13:16] in the blood of Jesus.
[2:13:19] Walk under the blood of Jesus
[2:13:22] that you may be a new lamp
[2:13:26] without any leaven
[2:13:30] as the bride of Jesus Christ. And then
[2:13:32] he says in verse 8, "Therefore
[2:13:36] let us keep the feast,
[2:13:39] not with old leaven,
[2:13:43] neither with the leaven of malice
[2:13:47] and wickedness,
[2:13:49] but with the unleaven bride,
[2:13:55] sincerity and truth."
[2:14:00] Now this is what the spirit was telling
[2:14:02] brother brother
[2:14:04] you must be more sincere.
[2:14:08] Praise the name of our lord. You must be
[2:14:10] more sincere
[2:14:13] yourself if you are going to help
[2:14:15] somebody.
[2:14:17] You know the Bible says
[2:14:20] that a thief cannot go into a strong
[2:14:23] man's house
[2:14:26] and steal anything
[2:14:29] if he can't bind him
[2:14:32] now. How about you
[2:14:36] now? If for you are bound,
[2:14:40] how will you set free another one? You
[2:14:43] are in chains,
[2:14:48] chains of lies,
[2:14:51] chains of
[2:14:55] how you loen someone who is also in the
[2:14:56] same. So you see that your chains are
[2:14:59] broken
[2:15:01] and when your chains are broken,
[2:15:04] you need to be energized
[2:15:06] to go and help another person.
[2:15:09] Praise the name of God. So he says,
[2:15:14] "Have the unleavened bread of sincerity
[2:15:17] and truth."
[2:15:24] Praise the name of God. That's the life
[2:15:26] we are meant to live.
[2:15:28] And when you live a life that is right
[2:15:30] before God,
[2:15:33] praise the name of God, nothing shall
[2:15:35] stand
[2:15:37] against your prayer.
[2:15:40] Praise the name of God. You have the
[2:15:42] power to release the
[2:15:45] you have the power to set the captives.
[2:15:49] Praise the name of God. You can speak it
[2:15:52] like brother was told.
[2:15:55] Bind it.
[2:15:57] Jesus told Peter, "Whatever you bind on
[2:16:00] earth
[2:16:02] shall be bound in heaven. Whatever you
[2:16:04] lose on earth shall be lo in heaven."
[2:16:07] But who does that? God in you.
[2:16:11] Praise the name of God. That should be
[2:16:12] our desire.
[2:16:14] Lord, let it be no longer be my mind,
[2:16:18] but let it be your mind working in me
[2:16:22] through the obedience of the word. Then
[2:16:25] you can tell I need to bind this.
[2:16:28] Praise the name of like Peter and John.
[2:16:32] Every time they were passing at that
[2:16:34] gate beautiful
[2:16:36] and that man was there already
[2:16:39] something years there
[2:16:41] but by the spirit of God
[2:16:45] he looked at this man and he said give
[2:16:48] me
[2:16:51] and you can't give what you don't have.
[2:16:54] Praise the name of God. You can't
[2:16:56] deliver when you're bound.
[2:16:59] So they told him silver and gold we
[2:17:02] don't have but such as we have in the
[2:17:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Rise up.
[2:17:09] Praise the name of there was power in
[2:17:12] them. They had the ability to release
[2:17:14] the person.
[2:17:17] We have also been given the same power.
[2:17:19] But how does it work in obedience to the
[2:17:22] word?
[2:17:24] Be more sincere.
[2:17:26] Be obedient to the word of the mind of
[2:17:30] God
[2:17:31] and then you will see yourself
[2:17:35] bringing many people to salvation
[2:17:37] testifying
[2:17:39] that when you testify
[2:17:41] the way the Bible says that whatever
[2:17:44] would speak
[2:17:46] whatever could speak
[2:17:49] it would come to pass. That's the same
[2:17:52] thing when we have the spirit of God
[2:17:55] working freely in us.
[2:17:58] It's no longer my mind.
[2:18:01] You're not doing something to be seen.
[2:18:05] Ah, he can do this
[2:18:07] like now in the Pentecostals.
[2:18:12] The big man, the powerful man of God has
[2:18:14] come.
[2:18:16] When the powerful man come,
[2:18:20] he goes back back with his power not
[2:18:23] like that.
[2:18:25] Praise the name of but a power to
[2:18:28] transform.
[2:18:30] Praise the name of. So in the message
[2:18:33] the paradox,
[2:18:35] brotherham says and I took the Bible and
[2:18:39] I pulled it open paragraph 76
[2:18:44] and then he said
[2:18:46] when you come
[2:18:49] I was planning to take a fast to the
[2:18:51] Lord
[2:18:55] and I told him I would go out and fast.
[2:18:59] I'm saying when you come to this feast
[2:19:03] which a fast
[2:19:05] is a feast a feast in the body is a
[2:19:08] feast with the Lord.
[2:19:13] Praise the name of Lord. Very
[2:19:15] interesting. You take time to pray and
[2:19:18] fast
[2:19:20] before the Lord.
[2:19:26] So we can have many parties or we can
[2:19:28] have many feasts.
[2:19:31] without money without price.
[2:19:34] Praise the name of you can have a feast
[2:19:38] very glorious
[2:19:42] even if you don't have money
[2:19:46] a feast with the Lord
[2:19:48] waiting on the Lord praying unto the
[2:19:51] Lord seeking the face of the Lord.
[2:19:55] Praise the name of God. So we need to
[2:19:57] see
[2:19:58] that we have soul travail
[2:20:03] the salvation of the people
[2:20:06] that they may turn unto the Lord.
[2:20:10] Now the challenge we have nowadays,
[2:20:13] do we have task masters?
[2:20:17] Task masters.
[2:20:19] Let us go to Exodus as I try to finish.
[2:20:23] Exodus chapter one
[2:20:27] and then verse 11 verse4.
[2:20:33] Exodus 1 verse 11 to verse 14.
[2:20:42] The scripture says,
[2:20:46] "Therefore they did set over them task
[2:20:49] masters to afflict them with their
[2:20:52] burdens, and they built for far treasure
[2:20:55] cities, Pithon, and Ramsees.
[2:21:15] But the more they afflicted them, the
[2:21:17] more they multiplied and grew and they
[2:21:20] grew. They were grieved because of the
[2:21:22] children of Israel.
[2:21:37] And the Egyptians made the children of
[2:21:40] Israel to serve with rigor.
[2:21:50] Verse 13.
[2:21:58] And they made their lives bitter with
[2:22:01] hard bondage in motor and in brick and
[2:22:05] in all manner of services in the field
[2:22:08] all their service wherein they made
[2:22:11] themsel with rigor.
[2:22:34] Praise the name of our Lord. We also
[2:22:36] have task masters.
[2:22:40] Task masters.
[2:22:42] And the task master of today
[2:22:46] is covetousness.
[2:22:48] Ah,
[2:22:54] let us go to Luke 12.
[2:23:02] He says, "And one of the companies said
[2:23:05] unto him, Master, speak to my brother
[2:23:08] that he divide the inheritance with me."
[2:23:13] Luke 12:3.
[2:23:28] And he said unto him, "Man, who has made
[2:23:31] me a judge or a divider over you?"
[2:23:42] And he said unto them, "Take heed. Be
[2:23:47] aware of covetousness.
[2:23:49] For a man's life consists not in the
[2:23:52] abundancy of the things which he
[2:23:54] possesses.
[2:24:06] Taskmaster.
[2:24:10] I want to get this. I want to get this
[2:24:13] task master
[2:24:15] until there is no time for God.
[2:24:20] You come back home, you are too tired,
[2:24:23] no time to pray, no time to read your
[2:24:26] Bible, no time to read your message
[2:24:28] book.
[2:24:29] Even the time you come home is late.
[2:24:32] Sometimes even food you have no
[2:24:34] appetite.
[2:24:36] Just lie on bed. Wake up early in the
[2:24:38] morning back again. You are getting into
[2:24:42] this credit system.
[2:24:51] Task masters.
[2:24:54] Endless chase.
[2:24:57] endless.
[2:25:00] You struggle and you get I was reading
[2:25:02] an article.
[2:25:04] I think it was one of the presses in the
[2:25:06] US and they wrote and these were kind of
[2:25:10] people
[2:25:12] secular not even religious. They said a
[2:25:16] person struggles
[2:25:19] to get a million dollar. Now when he
[2:25:22] gets a million,
[2:25:24] he says, "No, I wish I had two."
[2:25:28] Now he's got a million dollar, but one
[2:25:31] is not enough.
[2:25:47] Then when he gets two,
[2:25:50] two is not enough.
[2:25:52] I need to get five.
[2:25:54] When he gets five, now I need to get 10.
[2:25:57] Then he says, "Now I'm in the class
[2:26:00] of maybe million dollars or whateveries.
[2:26:07] You may be a million dollar, but then
[2:26:09] those million dollar
[2:26:13] million says this one with a billion."
[2:26:19] And then there are those who are called
[2:26:20] super rich
[2:26:28] like the richest man in Africa.
[2:26:31] I was watching his interview.
[2:26:34] And then they asked him a question
[2:26:37] what thing do you think you've done? And
[2:26:39] you were like
[2:26:42] then he said you know I struggle to get
[2:26:45] here.
[2:26:47] He said that one day he went and told
[2:26:50] his accountant,
[2:26:53] he told him, "You go and withdraw $5
[2:26:57] million
[2:27:00] a million dollar from the bank cash.
[2:27:06] You know dollars they end up to 100.
[2:27:11] So to get 10,000 you need 1,00 you need
[2:27:14] maybe 100.
[2:27:18] So now you see how many bundles were
[2:27:20] there.
[2:27:22] So they brought them and put them on his
[2:27:24] table.
[2:27:26] He touched them and this is the things
[2:27:28] he was disturbing us.
[2:27:31] Then he told accountant take it back to
[2:27:33] the bank
[2:27:36] endless chess
[2:27:40] task masters. He said be aware of
[2:27:47] because it takes all your time.
[2:27:50] If you are plowing a quarter acre,
[2:27:57] you find next season let me work out to
[2:27:59] get half an acre.
[2:28:02] I wish I would get an acre.
[2:28:06] I said now at least have a big garden.
[2:28:09] Now when you pass around plantations,
[2:28:16] I use a hand sprinkler to get my crops
[2:28:21] and I need to get those overhead
[2:28:22] sprinklers
[2:28:25] work.
[2:28:27] You are working to be like
[2:28:30] but those are generations of hard work.
[2:28:36] This is a grand great grandchild. But
[2:28:38] then you want to be like him. Beware of
[2:28:42] coetous.
[2:28:45] Praise the name of Lord. Like when we
[2:28:47] talk about eating,
[2:28:50] how much time do you spend in a day
[2:28:52] eating?
[2:28:54] You look at the time you spend in
[2:28:56] breakfast.
[2:28:58] Maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes.
[2:29:02] Lunch time maybe 30 minutes or 1 hour
[2:29:07] evening maybe one for 30 minutes or 1
[2:29:10] hour

[2:29:18] but by every word
[2:29:21] out of the mouth
[2:29:23] and Jesus told his disciples you can't
[2:29:26] even watch with me for one hour
[2:29:31] how much Time are you watching with him?
[2:29:36] 5 minutes in the morning,
[2:29:38] one minute during lunch time to pray. 30
[2:29:41] 30 seconds
[2:29:43] because you are fearing poison
[2:29:48] and sometimes even your eyes are not
[2:29:50] closed because you fear somebody's going
[2:29:51] to put their poison in your phone.
[2:29:55] So

[2:30:34] rest of the thing.

[2:30:41] And you know the Bible says Christ is
[2:30:44] the chief shepherd
[2:30:48] and the bishop of our souls.

[2:30:59] Not even an hour to watch with him. Not
[2:31:03] even
