[34:42] son and sent forth his servants to call
[34:46] them that were beid to the wedding and
[34:48] they would not come

[35:06] fatlings are killed and all things are
[35:09] ready come unto the marriage
[35:30] but they made light of it and went their
[35:32] ways one to his farm another to his
[35:45] merchandise and and the remnant took his
[35:48] servants and and treated them spitefully
[35:51] and slew
[36:02] but when the king heard thereof he was
[36:04] rough and he sent forth his armies and

[36:58] seated amen we shall continue down with
[37:01] the
[37:04] scripture amen amen and still let's
[37:07] continue with
[37:09] Matthew and
[37:16] verse verse 8
[37:21] say
[37:26] then yes
[37:29] to8 then sayi he to his servants the
[37:32] wedding is ready but they which were
[37:34] bidden were not
[37:43] worthy go ye therefore into the highways
[37:46] and as many as you shall find beat the
[37:48] marriage
[37:57] so the servants went out into the
[38:00] highways and gathered together all as
[38:02] many as they found both bad and good and
[38:05] the wedding was fished
[38:18] withs and when the king came in to see
[38:20] the guests he saw there a man which had
[38:24] not on a wedding garment
[38:35] and he saith unto him friend how comest
[38:38] thou in hether not having a wedding Gage
[38:42] and he was
[38:52] Speech praise the
[38:54] Lord so for our text this
[38:59] evening we shall take a study on God's
[39:02] requirements to the
[39:06] bride God
[39:11] requirements praise the Lord so we have
[39:14] read this
[39:15] Parable the parable about the wedding
[39:19] supper and now
[39:21] Jesus speaks this
[39:23] Parable and says there was a certain
[39:27] King
[39:29] and he made a marriage for his
[39:31] son and though he sent out
[39:35] servants to go and call the invited
[39:39] guests for the wedding but they would
[39:42] not
[39:43] come and then he sent again the
[39:46] servants to go and ask whoever they find
[39:49] along the
[39:51] way to come and attend the
[39:53] wedding and they came but now to the
[39:57] wedding
[39:58] because it is a wedding it's a special
[40:02] occasion and so there was a special
[40:06] garment that was given to each of the of
[40:09] the
[40:10] guests praise the Lord and every one of
[40:14] the guests that attended the
[40:17] wedding had to pass through the
[40:20] door or they get to the
[40:24] wedding to be dressed with a garment
[40:28] praise the Lord so this
[40:30] garment praise the Lord made all the all
[40:33] the all the guests look
[40:36] uniform small or
[40:39] great rich or poor they all just looked
[40:42] the
[40:43] same because of this G and now as the
[40:47] King was moving
[40:49] through he finds a man who does not have
[40:53] the gar
[40:55] on then he asked him
[40:58] how did you come in
[41:00] here how come you do not have the
[41:02] Garment on
[41:04] you praise the Lord and now the man the
[41:07] Bible says and he was
[41:11] speechless he was speechless because he
[41:14] had no
[41:16] excuse to give to the
[41:19] king praise the Lord because by matter
[41:22] of fact that he attended the
[41:25] wedding it means he had had the
[41:29] invitation he
[41:32] had as others were being
[41:35] invited so he also had the
[41:38] call and the instructions were
[41:41] clear that must pass through the
[41:45] door to receive the
[41:48] Garment qualify us for the
[41:50] wedding but he was
[41:52] speechless because he heard it
[41:57] but possibly he did not
[41:59] obey and so he went by other
[42:03] ways and found himself to to the
[42:07] wedding and the Bible says then say the
[42:10] king to the
[42:12] servants bind him hand and
[42:16] foot and take him
[42:20] away and cast him into out
[42:25] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[42:27] nashing of
[42:29] teeth so now the Rob is all that was
[42:32] required
[42:35] for no matter how smart you
[42:40] dressed no matter how rich or poor you
[42:45] were without
[42:47] the whether you were a sound to the
[42:51] king but without a ro you had no place
[42:55] at the wedding supper
[42:59] praise the Lord so this is the
[43:02] requirement that the king
[43:05] demanded of each of the invited
[43:09] guests and this garment was given of the
[43:12] king
[43:14] freely as long as anyone heard the
[43:19] voice they obeyed the
[43:21] voice and came through the
[43:24] door the servant was already at the door
[43:28] giving every invited guest a
[43:33] garment praise the Lord because that was
[43:36] the only requirement that they
[43:40] had praise the Lord and when the
[43:42] invitation had gone
[43:44] out the king never
[43:47] specified he never said look for the
[43:49] well
[43:51] behaved he never said look for the well
[43:54] dressed or look for the educated
[43:58] for the most
[43:59] eloquent but he said whatever you
[44:04] find them to come praise the Lord and
[44:08] whoever heard the
[44:10] voice and obeyed the voice of the
[44:13] servant and came in by the
[44:16] door they were given their
[44:19] wedding praise the name of living God
[44:23] tonight I want to say this that Christ
[44:27] the says Jesus Christ is the
[44:30] door now God requires us of one
[44:34] thing praise the Lord he has given us
[44:37] his
[44:38] instruction he has given us his
[44:42] requirements that we must have for us to
[44:46] enter into the
[44:48] rupture praise the Lord but even before
[44:51] the
[44:52] Rapture God has laid down a few
[44:55] requirements
[44:57] for us to
[45:00] meet in order to appear before him in
[45:04] order to claim our blessing before him
[45:07] in order claim our healing before
[45:09] him praise the Lord and without that
[45:13] instruction we cannot meet God we cannot
[45:17] please God and now what are those
[45:21] remember from where we took our
[45:24] scripture the requirement that was there
[45:26] was the RO
[45:29] and then the next thing the invited
[45:32] guest must listen to the
[45:36] instructions and obey the
[45:39] instructions and enter into the wedding
[45:41] The
[45:42] Wedding by the door and when they reach
[45:46] the door they are given a
[45:49] garment a
[45:51] Rob praise the Lord to cover them a Rob
[45:57] their
[45:58] identity prise the Lord a Rob to hide
[46:01] their
[46:03] Darkness maybe some came with that with
[46:06] a lot of
[46:07] that and they could not be worthy to
[46:10] stand before the king for the
[46:12] wedding the fact that they obeyed the
[46:15] voice and entered through the door they
[46:19] were given a garments to cover their
[46:24] Darkness praise the Lord and even though
[46:26] one came with by with
[46:29] nakedness that Rob covered their
[46:32] nakedness environment by which nobody
[46:35] could
[46:37] enter wedding place without praise the
[46:41] Lord and now here God has given us
[46:44] Grace and he has provided us
[46:47] instructions he has provided us with
[46:50] requirements that we must have as the
[46:53] Bride of Jesus
[46:55] Christ first of
[46:57] he sent us his
[46:59] son praise the Lord and when he sent us
[47:02] his son he sent the son to Die For Us
[47:07] Praise the Lord he sent the son and
[47:10] Jesus Christ came and he preached the
[47:13] gospel he lived the life praise the Lord
[47:18] and then he was sacrificed upon the
[47:20] cross for us and now if we believe on
[47:25] him praise the Lord if we believe on
[47:28] Jesus
[47:28] Christ the Bible says behold I stand at
[47:32] the door and
[47:34] knock God sends Jesus and now Jesus says
[47:39] I stand at the door and
[47:42] knock and if any man hear my
[47:45] voice praise the Lord and they open the
[47:48] door I will come into them and will Ser
[47:52] with them praise the Lord and so if
[47:55] Jesus is the
[47:58] it's only by Jesus
[48:00] Christ the lord as he stands at the door
[48:03] and
[48:05] knocks praise the Lord by Knocking by
[48:09] standing at the door the voice is the
[48:12] word that is being
[48:14] preached it is the word that is preached
[48:16] our
[48:17] souls it is the voice of God speaking to
[48:21] us open our hearts for him to enter
[48:25] in the Bible tells us Jesus is the door
[48:31] praise the Lord and whoever is coming
[48:33] unto
[48:34] God must first come through Jesus
[48:38] Christ it's only by Jesus Christ that we
[48:42] are able to reach God so first of all we
[48:46] have to express our
[48:49] willingness we have to express our
[48:53] obedience to the voice that is spoken
[48:55] out
[48:57] the word that is
[48:58] preached praise the Lord And now when we
[49:01] express our
[49:03] obedience praise the lord we now listen
[49:06] to The Voice and when we obey the voice
[49:10] praise the lord we open our hearts and
[49:12] he comes in and he servs with us praise
[49:16] the name Living God says behold I stand
[49:19] at the door and
[49:21] KN If any man hear my voice so hear the
[49:25] requirement
[49:27] is for us to hear the
[49:29] voice and when we hear the voice obey
[49:33] the voice and open your heart for him to
[49:37] come in Praise the Lord and when he
[49:40] comes in he makes an AB in our hearts he
[49:44] makes an in our lives and he gives us of
[49:48] his
[49:49] life so the requirement there is for us
[49:53] to
[49:54] believe when you hear the voice
[49:57] believe the voice when you believe the
[49:59] voice praise the Lord accept what the
[50:02] voice
[50:04] says and obey the voice so we see this
[50:08] man come by some other
[50:11] way not through the door and so he
[50:15] couldn't get the
[50:16] Garment praise the lord we must come
[50:19] through the
[50:21] door to get dressed with a
[50:23] ro a garment for the wedding
[50:27] before we can be accepted into the
[50:30] wedding we must come through Jesus
[50:34] Christ we must come through the word we
[50:37] know Jesus Christ prise the lord the
[50:40] scripture tells us that Jesus Christ is
[50:44] the
[50:44] Lamb that was offered for our
[50:47] sins praise the Lord and regardless of
[50:50] how that we
[50:52] made as long as we accept the voice
[50:56] come through Jesus Christ his blood that
[51:00] we poured upon the cross sufficient
[51:03] cleanse us of all our
[51:04] sins to make us clean so we can enter
[51:08] through the door to the wedding praise
[51:11] the Lord so we come through Jesus Christ
[51:15] praise the Lord he cleanses us of our
[51:17] sins he wases us of our sins he forgives
[51:21] all our sins forgives all our
[51:24] weaknesses understand Bible says when we
[51:28] believe and we make confession and you
[51:31] are
[51:32] baptized you are then given the holy
[51:35] spirit so now when you come through the
[51:38] door which is Jesus Christ after he has
[51:41] cleansed you and has forgiven us of our
[51:44] sins then he gives us the Holy
[51:48] Spirit which is the
[51:50] requirement for us to meet God praise
[51:53] the Lord he gives us the Holy Spirit
[51:56] which is the requirement for us to reach
[51:59] God praise the Lord and we know that the
[52:02] ultimate purpose of our
[52:04] life is to enter into
[52:07] eternity praise the Lord the
[52:11] goal clim of our
[52:14] calling is to enter into
[52:17] eternity praise the lord and there is no
[52:19] can enter into
[52:21] eternity without the holy spirit so now
[52:24] when we come through Jesus we are given
[52:27] the
[52:28] Rob we are given the Holy Spirit which
[52:32] is the seal that seals us and presents
[52:37] us worth for the
[52:40] wedding praise the Living God so now the
[52:43] prophet says here this but this man must
[52:46] have come in a
[52:48] window he slipped
[52:50] in now look when the king the bridegroom
[52:54] said to him
[52:56] friend how did you get
[52:58] in that showed there had been some good
[53:01] oldfashioned holy
[53:04] preachers down on the ground for he
[53:07] stood
[53:09] speechless he had sat maybe in the
[53:11] Chicago
[53:13] meeting he know better he know it before
[53:18] God he couldn't say I never had about
[53:21] it so he had been in the in some Holy
[53:25] Ghost meetings
[53:28] he had seen the lame
[53:30] heal the
[53:32] Blind and seen the great miracles of
[53:35] god he stood
[53:38] speechless and what did God
[53:40] said do with that
[53:43] man find him hand and foot and throw him
[53:47] in outer
[53:49] Darkness suit yourself friend suit
[53:53] yourself that's the gospel
[53:56] Jesus's own
[53:58] words it wasn't only a
[54:01] parable it was a prophecy and it will be
[54:04] the way
[54:06] someday so tonight when the gates are
[54:09] open and Waters are flowing
[54:13] free and everything is ready and the
[54:16] father knocks at your heart and
[54:19] says you've been playing Church long

[55:07] voice and Christ says I'll come
[55:10] in and I'll come him and him with me and

[55:22] speaks let's be open
[55:26] the doors of our
[55:27] hearts and let him in to stand with us

[1:04:28] then Jesus said unto them verily I say
[1:04:32] unto you I am the door of the
[1:04:35] sheep all that ever came before me are
[1:04:39] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[1:04:42] not hear
[1:04:50] them
[1:04:52] Matthew Matthew
[1:05:14] all that ever came before me are thieves
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:18] robers but the Sheep did not hear
[1:05:21] them I am the door by me if any man ENT
[1:05:27] in he shall be saved and shall go in and
[1:05:31] out and find
[1:05:34] P so the requirement we see here that
[1:05:38] anyone that comes to
[1:05:39] God must come
[1:05:42] by and through Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ I am the door and anyone that
[1:05:48] comes by
[1:05:50] me and enter in through
[1:05:53] me shall be saved
[1:05:56] and he shall go out and shall come in
[1:06:00] and you shall find pasture it's a
[1:06:02] guaranted
[1:06:04] blessing when we come by the of Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ AED blessing that we shall go out
[1:06:11] and shall come in and we shall find our
[1:06:15] blessing praise the Lord so I am the
[1:06:19] door how does he become the door because
[1:06:23] by his precious blood
[1:06:25] the blood of Jesus
[1:06:27] Christ our sins are
[1:06:30] forgiven and we are Justified and
[1:06:33] cleansed and made holy before God so one
[1:06:37] must come by Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ and without him we cannot find
[1:06:43] God praise the Lord without Jesus we
[1:06:47] cannot be God praise the Lord and what
[1:06:50] does Bible say in the book of of John
[1:06:53] chapter one
[1:06:55] Jesus is the word so without the word of
[1:06:59] God you cannot meet God praise the Lord
[1:07:03] in the beginning was the word and that
[1:07:06] word was with God and that that word is
[1:07:09] God and Jesus is the word of God without
[1:07:14] the word you cannot meet God and so we
[1:07:18] see this man maybe when he heard the
[1:07:21] word of
[1:07:22] God he came by some other way
[1:07:26] and he rejected the only proed way of
[1:07:28] the
[1:07:30] Cross rejected Jesus Christ but he heard
[1:07:34] the word he sat under the
[1:07:37] preaching he had the servant speaking
[1:07:39] out invting all of them for the
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:45] supper come for theer for the wedding
[1:07:49] there is the wedding of my master's
[1:07:52] son come to the wedding repent of your
[1:07:55] SS wash Yourself In The
[1:07:58] Blood come by the door and you shall
[1:08:01] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:04] maybe he never
[1:08:06] listened and he thought he would find
[1:08:08] himself in
[1:08:09] there maybe he never open the door of
[1:08:12] his
[1:08:13] heart praise the Lord so each time he
[1:08:16] start before the
[1:08:17] service and the word of God was being
[1:08:20] preached maybe he thought that was not
[1:08:22] for him and maybe he sent it someone
[1:08:26] else praise the Lord and he never opened
[1:08:29] the door of his
[1:08:30] heart and he never received his Ro but
[1:08:34] Jesus says I am the
[1:08:36] door praise the Lord and
[1:08:39] anyone that wants to meet God must come
[1:08:43] through the door God is provided
[1:08:46] way is
[1:08:48] requirement for us to meet him praise
[1:08:51] the lord we must have the
[1:08:54] faith must trust the
[1:08:57] word whatever the word says obey and do
[1:09:02] according to what the word has say if it
[1:09:05] seems to be very
[1:09:07] difficult even if it seems to be very
[1:09:10] difficult grace is
[1:09:12] sufficient ask for the grace of God to
[1:09:16] enable you take his
[1:09:18] word ask the grace of God to help us
[1:09:21] take him at his
[1:09:23] word and then let trust the word of God
[1:09:28] whatever the word of God
[1:09:29] says let's obey and
[1:09:32] Trust we know of a woman praise the Lord
[1:09:36] who was in the Bible the Bible talks
[1:09:39] about her she had a blood
[1:09:42] issue shall suffer 12
[1:09:45] years and the Bible says shall spend all
[1:09:49] her
[1:09:50] living upon
[1:09:52] Physicians shall move from one physician
[1:09:54] to another
[1:09:57] Lord but not
[1:10:00] found and now here comes one day when
[1:10:03] Jesus was on his way to go and pray for
[1:10:07] J's
[1:10:08] daughter praise the Lord the Bible says
[1:10:11] the crowd was too
[1:10:13] much and the crowd strong
[1:10:16] Jesus but there was this woman because
[1:10:20] she had
[1:10:21] heard that Jesus is the door she had
[1:10:25] heard
[1:10:26] that Jesus is God is provided to her
[1:10:31] healing what Jesus had done she had
[1:10:35] heard a voice the spoken word so she
[1:10:38] believed it and she trusted and so when
[1:10:42] she saw Jesus praise the Lord she said I
[1:10:45] don't want him to pray for me but in his
[1:10:48] word he say by his stripes I am healed
[1:10:53] so she took up that word
[1:10:55] so she pressed all through go and meet
[1:10:59] Jesus and she had Faith that's the first
[1:11:03] requirement she had faith and on faith
[1:11:07] she trusted God praise the Lord she had
[1:11:12] believe she believed in the word of
[1:11:15] God believed that when she touches him
[1:11:19] should be healed there was nothing that
[1:11:22] she
[1:11:22] required all she requireed was to touch
[1:11:26] because she had faith that as long as
[1:11:29] Jesus was there and she touched him her
[1:11:33] condition was complete her condition was
[1:11:36] hard she did not require Jesus to pray
[1:11:39] for her well Jus
[1:11:42] required that Jesus goes to pray for for
[1:11:45] his
[1:11:46] daughter this woman praise the Lord she
[1:11:50] had
[1:11:51] faith that she was healed and all was
[1:11:56] requiring was to touch her touch him
[1:12:00] touching him could not heal her but have
[1:12:04] faith have trust in the word have trust
[1:12:08] in Jesus is what heal her praise the
[1:12:12] Lord so when she went there it was a
[1:12:16] confirmation of her faith she was healed
[1:12:21] praise the Lord that's what God has
[1:12:22] proved for us to and obey his
[1:12:27] word prise the Lord if we need
[1:12:30] healing let us believe let's believe his
[1:12:34] word he gave all his
[1:12:36] promises praise the Lord he promised he
[1:12:40] is the
[1:12:41] Lord God who
[1:12:44] heal all our
[1:12:47] diseases praise the Lord so if we are in
[1:12:50] sickness in moments of sickness let's
[1:12:54] trust
[1:12:55] we have no control over them but he whom
[1:12:59] we believe has control over the sickness
[1:13:03] so when you believe and you confess it
[1:13:06] for your healing you receive your
[1:13:09] healing praise the Lord why because he
[1:13:12] given in the
[1:13:13] word and his word never

[1:13:20] behold I stand at the
[1:13:22] door anyone that opens the door
[1:13:26] I will come in and I'll be with him so
[1:13:30] when he's sick and he has faith in me I
[1:13:34] shall take away his
[1:13:36] sicknesses that is the promise walking
[1:13:39] in the promises of God obeying the word
[1:13:42] of God and walking in the requirements
[1:13:45] of God as long as we are
[1:13:49] sure that we we have made the
[1:13:51] requirements of
[1:13:53] God let us rest our
[1:13:56] Souls praise the Lord as long as we are
[1:13:59] sure of the word he has provided all in
[1:14:03] the word let us rest and be

[1:14:11] come our way without any doubt with all
[1:14:16] our faith and trust in his
[1:14:18] word shall come to pass praise the lord
[1:14:22] we have seen so many men women in the
[1:14:26] Bible that trusted in the Lord that
[1:14:29] waited upon the
[1:14:31] Lord as long as they were sure that they
[1:14:34] made the requirements of
[1:14:36] God whatever they prayed for came to
[1:14:40] pass and it's a cloud of witness it's a
[1:14:44] cloud of
[1:14:45] witness and is written in the book of
[1:14:48] Hebrews that all those men and
[1:14:52] women are a cloud of witness
[1:14:56] praise the lord we look up to them you
[1:14:59] look up to job and look at your
[1:15:01] situation and you believe God for for it
[1:15:04] shall come to pass that you will

[1:15:08] situation why because about job that
[1:15:12] even when everything else was
[1:15:14] destroyed God came through for
[1:15:17] him in the moment of your
[1:15:21] destruction and in
[1:15:23] distress you Lear trust God you learn to
[1:15:27] believe God you learn go by his word you

[1:15:42] the Lord Our God wants to be glorified

[1:15:48] glorified when we surrender
[1:15:50] ourselves and tell him we canot do
[1:15:53] anything on our own
[1:15:55] then he comes in to take over why he has
[1:16:00] to be
[1:16:01] glorified in every
[1:16:03] situation that a Believer
[1:16:06] faces all he requires of the

[1:16:53] woman required
[1:16:55] fa and what happened the Bible says that
[1:17:00] when
[1:17:01] Jesus when she touched
[1:17:03] him Jesus looked
[1:17:05] around and says who
[1:17:09] touched it was a Special Touch of
[1:17:12] face we can tou Jesus through our
[1:17:17] prayers a prayer of face praise the Lord
[1:17:21] until God is convinced to turn around

[1:20:08] you have separated your faith from
[1:20:11] them have complete
[1:20:13] faith in me he says thy
[1:20:17] faith has made the Wall go in peace and

[1:21:01] of the
[1:21:02] eag that had gotten into a wrong
[1:21:05] Nest praise the lord we know the prophet
