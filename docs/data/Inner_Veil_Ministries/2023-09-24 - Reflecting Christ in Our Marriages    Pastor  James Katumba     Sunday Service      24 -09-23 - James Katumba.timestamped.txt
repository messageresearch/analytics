[14:10] father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[14:12] Christ
[14:13] again thank you this afternoon
[14:17] again in your presence
[14:33] they shall be told of the Lord
[14:36] shall be their peace
[14:42] establish our marriages
[14:45] father make us walk and live in the way
[14:48] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:58] amen amen let us turn to Ephesians
[15:01] chapter five
[15:04] Ephesians chapter 5.
[15:07] we read from verse
[15:10] 28 up to verse
[15:12] 33. some of them
[15:16] the scripture says so
[15:21] ought to men to love their wives as
[15:23] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[15:26] loveth himself
[15:34] foreign
[16:04] foreign
[16:18] for we are members of his body of his
[16:21] flesh and of his bones
[16:27] for this course shall a man leave his
[16:29] father and mother and shall be joined
[16:32] unto his wife and the two they too shall
[16:35] be one flesh or Montage
[16:45] this is a great mystery but I speak
[16:48] concerning Christ and the church
[16:54] nevertheless let every one of you in
[16:57] particular so love his wife even as
[17:00] himself
[17:01] and the wife see that she reverends her
[17:05] husband
[17:22] I want to preach on the subject
[17:26] reflecting Christ in our marriage oh
[17:34] reflecting Christ in our marriage
[17:38] praise the name of our Lord now we know
[17:41] that in the scriptures
[17:44] marriage was started by God himself
[17:49] when you read in Genesis
[17:54] it is God who said that's not good for a
[17:57] man to be alone
[18:00] and when God say it's not good for a man
[18:03] to be alone
[18:05] God himself said
[18:08] I'll make him a hell of meat
[18:14] God himself
[18:16] testified it is not good for a man to be
[18:20] alone
[18:22] and then he said I will make him a help
[18:26] mate
[18:30] and here we yeah
[18:32] each of us sowed to be in marriage
[18:37] and by the grace of God you got into the
[18:41] marriage
[18:44] I believe not none of us was forced into
[18:47] the marriage
[18:50] I believe none of us was much made it is
[19:02] because there are some places where they
[19:04] might make
[19:06] sure now this one here you go with this
[19:10] we don't believe in that first week is
[19:13] you may have a desire that I wish this
[19:16] brother would go with this sister
[19:20] I wish this sister would accept that
[19:23] brother
[19:35] you wait
[19:39] Just Praise the name you know like there
[19:41] are some scenarios that happened
[19:44] and then you know you see somebody is
[19:46] trying to spend time with somebody who
[19:48] is you may not help at all wow
[19:53] then you start wondering how I wish
[20:07] you're just going to
[20:10] go to the other one you take the other
[20:12] one don't do that even for your children
[20:15] you can't do that
[20:17] praise the name of Allah so I believe
[20:20] none of us was put into that square
[20:22] where you had no option so take it is
[20:27] the choice of Adam was made for him
[20:32] you know it's God who brought the womb
[20:36] the wounds and then he brought the woman
[20:38] to the man
[20:40] and then the man recognized that this is
[20:43] now Flesh of My Flesh
[20:49] and then he took her to be his wife
[20:53] so now God recognized
[20:57] the need of marriage of
[21:00] foreign
[21:01] [Music]
[21:29] and then God
[21:31] created him a likeness
[21:36] and that's what our marriage should be I
[21:38] don't know
[21:40] your likeness
[21:46] praise the name of our Lord you marry
[21:49] somebody that you love
[21:51] and so now as you know love is the
[21:55] foundation of marriage
[21:59] that love should continue in our
[22:01] marriage
[22:03] don't allow illustration to come and
[22:07] take away love from your marriage
[22:16] maybe issues of poverty maybe issues of
[22:20] sickness maybe issues of barrenness
[22:24] you know but you should not allow
[22:27] anything
[22:29] away your love for your husband or for
[22:32] your wife
[22:36] much as possible
[22:38] now if you get into a situation where
[22:40] you don't love one another
[22:44] then that
[22:49] that you know you are hardening your
[22:51] heart against your husband
[22:54] you are hardening your heart against
[22:56] your wife
[22:58] and this one should not be
[23:01] because you married somebody who is part
[23:04] of you
[23:06] now the scripture has told us
[23:11] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 28.
[23:16] so old men to love their wives as their
[23:20] own bodies
[23:24] you know the way you love your body
[23:28] if you fall sick the way you try to rush
[23:32] to the hospital
[23:33] that is the same feeling that should be
[23:36] extended
[23:46] so then you should love your your wife
[23:48] also this is what the Lord wants us to
[23:52] do and when you love your wife you are
[23:56] doing things according to the word of
[23:57] God then you are reflecting Christ
[24:01] in your marriage
[24:05] until if maybe you are in the
[24:07] neighborhood
[24:11] oh maybe you know like
[24:13] music
[24:15] is where people know what has happened
[24:18] to the others
[24:21] what you ate last night whether how many
[24:24] shots you have
[24:26] you know they can know that this man has
[24:29] only one shot
[24:32] this one here the shoes are worn out but
[24:35] again they can just know everything
[24:37] about it
[24:39] so now if you have Christ in your
[24:41] marriage
[24:43] then the neighborhood will know I wish
[24:47] my husband was like that
[24:51] I wish my wife was like
[24:55] they are saying in Christ in your
[24:57] marriage
[24:58] they are seeing the love you have for
[25:01] one another
[25:02] they are seeing the kindness you have
[25:04] foreign
[25:22] with six with six things
[25:25] that you know unite us then what divide
[25:29] us
[25:30] praise the name of our Lord don't look
[25:32] for things that divide you
[25:34] don't look for things that you know will
[25:37] hurt the other person
[25:39] but you are careful
[25:42] again if you hurt the other feel sorry
[25:44] about it
[25:46] seek for forgiveness
[25:48] please forgive me please I didn't do to
[25:52] this kind of thing
[25:53] I didn't intend to do this kind of
[25:55] things
[25:58] you know you you are kind of avoiding
[26:02] having a hard heart
[26:05] you know you don't want to have a Stony
[26:08] heart against your husband or your wife
[26:12] but you are kind
[26:15] and then the Bible tells us
[26:22] let us go to First Peter chapter three
[26:24] yeah
[26:27] praise the name of our Lord
[26:32] First Peter chapter 3 verse 8.
[26:38] the Bible says finally be all of One
[26:42] mind having compassion one of another
[26:45] love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[26:51] foreign
[27:16] [Music]
[27:39] that's when you need it
[27:42] and then he says
[27:45] love as Brethren
[27:50] be pitiful
[27:54] pitiful
[27:56] in other words amen
[27:58] you you are trying to stand with one
[28:01] another
[28:03] you know you are concerned about their
[28:07] situation
[28:09] you are standing with your companion
[28:13] you are standing with your wife
[28:16] who are standing with your husband you
[28:20] know you are standing together even in
[28:22] that situation which is not pleasant
[28:26] praise the name of our Lord you are
[28:29] standing together
[28:31] like I remember the former president of
[28:34] the USA
[28:36] you know that was the
[28:40] Mr Clinton
[28:43] and now he had some kind of Scandal
[28:47] which was there
[28:49] no something wrong he had done and now
[28:53] these people of the Republican
[28:56] you know of course everybody wants to
[28:59] pull the other one down
[29:02] so now they brought the
[29:04] Monica lewinsking
[29:09] that you know when she was working in
[29:11] this White House Clinton did something
[29:14] wrong with her
[29:16] white house
[29:18] but you know
[29:21] the wife of the president
[29:26] stood with her husband
[29:29] yet that act I think would have hurt
[29:34] more than any other person
[29:37] but she stood with her husband
[29:40] even when when the husband did was
[29:43] shameful
[29:47] was something that was demeaning her
[29:51] but she stood with her husband
[29:55] and then and the until now they are
[29:58] still standing together when they left
[29:59] the white house
[30:02] so the Bible tells us to be pitiful
[30:10] you are showing kindness to one another
[30:15] even in their weaknesses
[30:18] even in their failures
[30:21] praise the name of Allah and you see if
[30:25] you don't show kindness
[30:27] if you don't show compassion
[30:31] you know if you were not really as a
[30:35] person who is of support to your husband
[30:37] or your wife
[30:41] then you are opening room for the devil
[30:43] to get in your midis
[30:46] and then you find that everybody starts
[30:50] being living in a life of isolation
[30:54] he doesn't
[31:12] and then you know if anything small like
[31:16] this happens
[31:17] your imaginations becomes wrong and
[31:21] then you start thinking
[31:33] you know something which happened at
[31:35] some time
[31:37] you didn't show kindness you didn't show
[31:41] compassion you're not concerned about
[31:43] the other person's state of Hawaii so if
[31:46] something now happens
[31:48] then a complex keeps on growing
[31:53] together and then you find that somebody
[31:55] who never had the hypertension pressure
[32:01] somebody
[32:03] else
[32:05] because all these things can come from
[32:08] those kind of misunderstandings
[32:13] you don't have peace you are traveled
[32:17] you can't sleep
[32:24] then for you I've traveled about this
[32:29] but you understand
[32:31] [Music]
[32:34] this one doesn't care but at night
[32:37] you're meant to sleep I foreign
[33:16] confronted Jesus at the very beginning
[33:20] of his ministry
[33:25] and it confronted Moses at the very
[33:27] beginning of his ministry
[33:32] it is a foremost question in believer's
[33:35] heart
[33:37] foreign
[33:46] [Music]
[34:20] [Music]
[34:27] now if
[34:31] the beginning of sin
[34:34] started in an area of marriage
[34:40] then how about now
[34:44] so then you see that the devil has still
[34:47] interest in the marriage
[34:51] and then he makes sure
[34:54] that the husband and the wife
[34:57] they cannot you know move as one
[35:02] so the devil will ensure that he creates
[35:05] differences in the marriage
[35:08] maybe something comes up here
[35:11] maybe it is a trial
[35:14] maybe it is a scene
[35:16] you know maybe it is a problem
[35:19] and the devil is trying to get along
[35:22] there
[35:25] and you know sometimes
[35:27] somebody can react in a way which is not
[35:30] appropriate to the other um
[35:34] and then now this one takes it as an
[35:37] offense amazing
[35:40] and then he holds a grudge and remember
[35:44] when it comes to eat supper if the wife
[35:47] has prepared the meal
[35:49] I'm satisfied
[35:52] now that goes to what happened
[35:56] oh if now the husband comes to eat the
[35:59] food
[36:00] and maybe the food is not well prepared
[36:03] maybe she's punishing me over the other
[36:05] thing
[36:07] and then you hold that thing in your
[36:09] heart
[36:10] and then you go to sleep your heart is
[36:14] not free to converse
[36:15] you wake up in the morning the whole day
[36:19] you are traveling that place
[36:23] or sometimes there is no problem you
[36:26] have left at home
[36:27] but at home you had to travel at work
[36:30] you had troubles
[36:36] now when you come home you are not
[36:39] behaving they used to behave every other
[36:41] day
[36:42] children want to play with you you are
[36:45] just sending them away
[36:48] how has been your day
[36:52] and the wife starts wondering
[36:54] then start thinking maybe the other day
[36:57] what I did was wrong
[37:00] maybe the house is not clean enough
[37:04] you know the devil will always try to
[37:07] get in any place
[37:10] bring Conflict at home
[37:16] now for you who stay at places of work
[37:19] and their troubles
[37:22] before you reach home pray that you get
[37:26] on with the right mode
[37:31] you say Lord let the Troubles of works
[37:38] let my troubles at work
[37:42] and let me have peace at home
[37:47] but now you are Carrying Your Troubles
[37:49] from work again you are bringing them
[37:52] home maybe the day has been a bad
[37:55] business day
[37:59] like now maybe brother
[38:01] the clients have not come the whole
[38:03] world and they want school fees for
[38:06] their children
[38:07] so you don't transfer that stress
[38:11] stress say praise the name of it
[38:13] sometimes maybe you expect it to be paid
[38:16] allowances
[38:19] and then there is no allowance but
[38:23] masala
[38:24] what do you do you transfer that
[38:28] pressure on your wife or your husband or
[38:30] what do you do
[38:32] follow it just take it to the Lord in
[38:34] prayers
[38:37] we just need to learn how to live
[38:39] foreign
[39:21] you know
[40:02] [Music]
[40:09] you know like to give somebody support
[40:17] you know he said I'll make him a helip
[40:20] meat
[40:24] um
[40:32] when you need help
[40:36] when you're failing in some of this
[40:39] when you can't easily go ahead
[40:42] you feel you cannot make it without the
[40:45] other
[40:47] s should be our lives
[40:49] you know I can't live without my wife I
[40:53] can't live without myself
[40:54] and be always concerned
[40:57] praise the name of Allah you know there
[41:01] are some families which is very
[41:03] unfortunate
[41:05] a
[41:15] woman they are working and they transfer
[41:17] come says please
[41:19] human resource transform it to the other
[41:21] place
[41:28] they find that their troubles at home
[41:31] but that's not that should not be what a
[41:34] marriage is
[41:36] how are you going to be a help me to the
[41:38] others
[41:41] so you find that there is wow
[41:49] each of us individually
[41:51] you should contribute the cause of the
[41:54] travel at home
[41:57] that's what the Lord wants us to do
[42:00] praise the name of Allah you shouldn't
[42:03] be the cause
[42:06] seek for forgiveness
[42:12] praise the name of our Lord you feel
[42:14] like you are the person to take the
[42:16] burden you know
[42:18] the person to take the pain
[42:22] but you don't be the person
[42:25] to inflict the pain
[42:28] but you take the pain upon yourself
[42:31] that's the true love of God
[42:35] that is the true attitude of the
[42:38] believer
[42:41] I just want to read it somewhere here
[42:46] as a true Christian
[42:49] to praise the name of our Lord you are
[42:52] allowed to take the pain
[42:56] you allowed to take
[42:59] and give the
[43:00] best offer wow
[43:06] now in the message Hebrews chapter 7
[43:12] says in paragraph 49.
[43:15] Abraham Ibrahim he didn't fast with lots
[43:27] it goes beyond being brethren
[43:30] we are husband and wife
[43:34] you know we are one then he said we must
[43:39] not
[43:40] foreign
[44:11] you know maybe when they are reporting
[44:13] their case
[44:14] when the wife is just talking like this
[44:17] husband comes back immediately
[44:20] when the wife is talking um
[44:26] nobody can give room to the other
[44:28] children
[44:29] that should not be like that
[44:32] praise the name of Allah
[44:35] we must not add you
[44:37] but lift up your head and go anywhere
[44:42] anywhere you want to go
[44:47] if you go east
[44:54] that is the Christian attitude
[44:59] foreign
[45:00] foreign
[45:43] praise the name of Allah and you know
[45:45] these are things that God wants us to
[45:48] practice
[45:50] let it
[45:52] let it put in your life let it work out
[45:54] in your marriage
[45:57] but then don't get counselors
[46:04] you know if you do like that you
[46:08] know it's not the way we take our
[46:09] Council
[46:11] take the pain
[46:14] that's a true Christian attitude
[46:19] you is causing the pain
[46:22] don't make it a happy
[46:25] day you know there are those who want to
[46:27] exploit that line
[46:29] when they know this is where my wife's
[46:32] weakness is
[46:35] where my husband's weakness
[46:38] then they want to exploit that weakness
[46:42] instead of standing to support
[46:45] that should not be in our marriages
[46:48] that should not be in our family
[46:51] praise the name of Allah we need to
[46:54] reflect Christina
[46:59] foreign
[47:30] dwell with them according to knowledge
[47:33] giving honor unto the wife us and to the
[47:36] weaker vessel and as being heard
[47:38] together of the grace of life that your
[47:40] prayers be not hindered
[47:43] much
[47:53] is
[48:08] amen Amina let us continue with the
[48:11] Colossians chapter 3 verse 19 then we
[48:13] shall get back to that scripture
[48:18] does that from us
[48:20] 18.
[48:22] he says wives submit yourselves unto
[48:27] your own husbands as it is fit in the
[48:31] Lord
[48:32] 18 18.
[48:37] collusions
[48:46] that's what the Bible says as wives you
[48:50] submit
[48:51] then as husbands you love
[48:55] praise the name of Allah let us not
[48:58] allow the the modern
[49:02] things
[49:07] I'm a fellow human beings
[50:01] [Music]
[50:09] against your spouse
[50:29] foreign and you know the root of
[50:32] bitterness
[50:35] you know we'll come and destroy
[50:37] everything
[50:39] so we need to have that genuine love in
[50:42] our hearts
[50:46] and don't allow bitterness
[50:50] against your wife even before she has
[50:54] done something wrong
[51:23] be
[51:30] [Music]
[51:56] let us go and look at Ephesians
[52:05] and then verse 29.
[52:07] he says let no corrupt communication
[52:11] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[52:14] is good to use of edifying that it may
[52:18] Minister Grace unto the hearers
[52:34] oh
[52:37] foreign
[53:24] and then we read word by word
[53:27] he says
[53:29] let all bitterness
[53:36] bitterness
[53:37] overcome with
[53:40] what is it saying
[53:43] you maintain the same
[53:46] bitterness
[53:50] and you know it is your wife
[53:53] it is your husband
[53:56] don't have bitterness
[54:00] regardless of what they have done
[54:04] foreign
[54:39] he says let all bitterness
[54:45] [Music]
[54:51] and the clama
[54:55] and evil speaking
[54:59] be put away from you
[55:02] with all malice no
[55:07] now you see each of these is a different
[55:10] Spirit
[55:12] but only one can bring all the others
[55:18] so you need to that you don't have any
[55:21] of that thing in your heart
[55:24] and you can never have bitterness
[55:28] and you said the Holy Ghost still there
[55:30] in the house
[55:32] because these things grieve the holy
[55:34] spirit
[55:36] so they grieve the Holy Spirit
[55:39] and then you see that you are in a
[55:42] condition of a kind of person
[55:48] everything you're going to handle is
[55:51] even the way you are going to to look
[55:54] what your wife will be like hey this man
[55:56] wants to kill me or what you're joking
[56:00] maybe the way you're going to look at
[56:02] your husband
[56:03] said I've never seen my wife like that
[56:06] I'm even fearing to go back home
[56:23] foreign
[56:28] [Music]
[56:43] praise the name of our Lord you may hurt
[56:46] one another and may be hard for you to
[56:49] reconciles
[56:56] so you need to take that this is my wife
[57:00] so you know
[57:01] this is my husband
[57:04] let me stand with him let me stand with
[57:07] her and you know when you show kindness
[57:10] when somebody has done something right
[57:14] you will be able to win that Soul
[57:19] praise the name of it or if you have
[57:22] hurt one another
[57:23] you is tenderhearted you who is a true
[57:27] Christian
[57:29] please I'm sorry
[57:31] please I'm sorry
[57:36] you don't say that it's his fault if
[57:39] that person come to me
[57:41] foreign
[57:45] [Music]
[58:07] you're not helping this relationship
[58:10] pray for him and if you have trusted
[58:17] people not you know there are some
[58:19] people you tell them something maybe to
[58:22] pray for you but to pray for you they
[58:25] are going to tell everybody
[58:32] oh we need to pray for them I pray is
[58:35] that
[58:38] you know you are just trying to paint
[58:40] you know broadcasting the whole thing

[58:50] maybe they are pretending
[58:54] yeah
[58:57] you know but there are some people I
[58:59] don't know why they would want to speak
[59:01] even about others
[59:04] any person is
[59:07] them that is hot news
[59:13] how would you feel about it
[59:16] foreign

[1:00:20] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[1:00:22] together of the grace of life that your
[1:00:25] prayers be not hindered much
[1:00:43] foreign
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:10] foreign
[1:01:29] because the Lord has been witness
[1:01:31] between the and the wife of the youth
[1:01:34] against whom though has dealt
[1:01:37] treacherously yet she is thy companion
[1:01:40] and the wife of thy Covenant
[1:01:43] foreign

[1:02:37] the wife of your youth
[1:02:39] like Dan is a youth
[1:02:42] Grace is the use
[1:02:47] and anything about Grace now is
[1:02:56] the name of Allah
[1:02:59] the wife of his youth
[1:03:04] the love
[1:03:08] Grace
[1:03:09] then it doesn't mind if you abuse him or
[1:03:13] you do what then yet

[1:03:21] and the good thing she's Grace

[1:03:28] Grace

[1:04:54] and then they tell you you're going to
[1:04:56] bring this bring this and you know the
[1:05:00] Bible says when the lab and told Jacob

[1:06:25] another yeah
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:33] when you go to a police officer
[1:06:37] he says I'm going to deal with you

[1:06:56] but dwell with her yeah
[1:07:01] and a good example
[1:07:03] you know in many of our characters
[1:07:12] and so even when you have you prepared
