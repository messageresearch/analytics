[25:11] opportunity they have given me to stand
[25:13] before
[25:14] you I believe
[25:16] it's it is humbling
[25:19] and uh a little bit nervous standing
[25:24] here I'm depending on your
[25:26] prayers so this evening by the grace of
[25:29] God I want to share with you about the
[25:32] treasure in these a vessels praise the
[25:35] name of the Lord and uh I just want to
[25:39] begin with a quote here in the message
[25:42] the Waters of Separation The Prophet
[25:45] side what taken place they go two Turtle
[25:50] does killed one over an Ann vessel with
[25:55] running water poured its blood into a
[25:58] Earthly vessel the Earthly vessel
[26:01] speaking of Christ's
[26:04] humility Christ humiliating himself
[26:08] coming down taking on an Earthly vessel
[26:12] and over the running water which the
[26:14] water which the water in that place
[26:17] spoke of the spirit praise the name of
[26:20] the Lord and one dove was killed and in
[26:23] this was put Ceda scarlet and he and the
[26:27] he
[26:28] sprinkled the living bird the living
[26:31] bird was taken out in a field and turned
[26:35] loose and when its Little Wings was a
[26:38] flattering and flying like that with the
[26:40] blood of its dead M on it for a
[26:43] cleansing of leprosy which is a type of
[26:46] sin was a type of the church with the
[26:50] blood of the Savior the Lord Jesus
[26:52] Christ who died in your state and the
[26:55] blood and the blood cried holy and unto
[26:58] the Lord and the blood sprinkling the
[27:01] ground holy holy holy unto the Lord a
[27:05] cleansing of leprosy praise the name of
[27:08] the Lord so here the prophet was
[27:11] speaking uh an inspiration fromus
[27:22] 14 Leviticus chter
[27:26] 14 concerning the cleansing of the
[27:35] leper so the prophet
[27:38] says and indeed when you read that that
[27:42] chapter you will find
[27:44] that that the
[27:46] Le for him to be
[27:50] cleansed the scripture says he had to
[27:53] take two totals
[27:59] and take them to the
[28:02] priest to kill one of the
[28:05] totals and
[28:08] one was left to go
[28:12] free but the blood of
[28:17] this toled on the
[28:21] other and the prophet
[28:23] say that this is an example
[28:28] over our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:31] coming to die for us that his blood
[28:35] might be sprinkled upon the
[28:39] church moving here to another place we
[28:41] are crying holy holy holy
[28:45] amen so when the prophet talks about
[28:49] Jesus Christ being
[28:57] humiliated Jesus Christ humilating
[29:00] himself coming down to this earth
[29:04] here taking on the Earthly
[29:07] vessel and when the prophet talks about
[29:10] the Earthly
[29:11] vessel he talking about the body of
[29:15] Flesh he's talking about this body of
[29:18] mine and
[29:20] yours he's talking about flesh and
[29:23] blood so he says Christ was humilated
[29:28] this flesh here to walk
[29:31] around and die for our sins that we
[29:34] might be
[29:36] redeemed praise the name of the Lord so
[29:39] the Earth
[29:40] vessel that's what we are referring to
[29:43] this
[29:51] evening there the scripture has told us
[29:56] that there is a treasure
[29:59] praise the name of the Lord and what is
[30:01] the
[30:02] treasure treasure is a store of precious
[30:08] [Music]
[30:10] je a
[30:12] treasure is a
[30:15] storage of things that are
[30:19] Priceless praise the name of the
[30:21] Lord and in these
[30:25] vsels you find that we cry
[30:29] [Music]
[30:30] he says we have trouble on every
[30:34] side let's continue with the scripture
[30:37] in second Corinthians chter
[30:40] 4 inse
[30:43] say but we have this treasure in a vels
[30:59] that the Excellence of the
[31:02] power may be of
[31:05] God not us and then he continues and
[31:10] says we are troubled on every
[31:16] side yet not
[31:19] distressed and then he say we are
[31:23] perplexed but not in
[31:26] despair
[31:28] persecuted but not
[31:30] forsaken cast down but not
[31:36] destroyed so in this body that we live
[31:40] in we have a lot of troubles that
[31:43] surround
[31:45] us and the
[31:47] TR they not going away
[31:50] now because the scripture
[31:53] says the book of
[31:58] chter
[32:01] 14
[32:05] 14 the scripture
[32:08] says from verse
[32:15] one job 14
[32:21] verse1 man that is born of a woman is of
[32:25] few days and full of trouble
[32:33] so the scripture is talking about man of
[32:36] Flesh and
[32:39] Blood and the troubles are there the
[32:42] rest of this life
[32:47] here you leave one trouble you enter
[32:49] into
[32:52] another you leave one you don't need and
[32:54] then you enter into another you leave
[32:57] one you need not enter
[33:01] another so man that is born of
[33:05] woman is a few days and the few
[33:10] days full of
[33:13] trbl the scripture has told us
[33:16] also that this man is
[33:20] perplexed praise the name of the Lord
[33:23] and being
[33:25] perplexed being perplexed
[33:28] is to be without
[33:32] resources is to be in
[33:35] straight is to be left
[33:39] wanting you know to be
[33:42] embarrassed to be in
[33:47] doubt praise the name of the Lord not to
[33:51] know which way to turn
[33:53] to and the Greek Leon says that that is
[33:56] being perplexed
[33:58] so this body is
[34:01] perplexed you and I we are perplexed
[34:04] several times because we are seeing this
[34:08] vessel prise the name of the Lord and
[34:11] this body here persecuted still the SC
[34:15] says we are persecuted in this vessel PR
[34:20] the name of the Lord and the also say
[34:23] that we are cast down this might be a
[34:26] failure
[34:28] challenge you expect to do something and
[34:31] maybe someone has let you down but what
[34:34] does the scripture says we are never you
[34:37] know we never give up upon it let's get
[34:41] back to that scripture second
[34:42] Corinthians chapter
[34:43] 5 he says we are
[34:46] persecuted but yet not for seconden
[34:49] there for us all the
[34:50] time when we are persecuted praise the
[34:53] name of the Lord and he says we are
[34:55] troubled on every side
[34:58] we encamped around and we are fighting
[35:01] was every day not fighting against one
[35:05] another fighting the enemy
[35:07] Satan he enters one of us to persecute
[35:11] another he ENT your neighbor persecute
[35:15] you praise the name of the Lord but the
[35:17] scripture says that we are not
[35:21] forsaken praise the name of the Lord and
[35:23] he says we are cast
[35:25] down you see you want to do
[35:29] something that person I want you to do
[35:32] for me and the person cast you down
[35:35] person fails you the person maybe
[35:38] disappoints you the scripture says that
[35:42] you know he says but not
[35:56] destroy
[36:26] for so there the
[36:30] life that is to come we
[36:34] have has
[36:38] last this one has
[36:41] last and
[36:43] sickness and death because what is it it
[36:48] is not the house that has gone to be
[36:52] prepared praise the name of the Lord
[36:55] this is a best house how many knows what
[36:58] a past house is that is what you are
[37:01] living in a past house is where they put
[37:05] all the the the diseased
[37:07] people well that is just what sin done
[37:10] to us put us in in another pest house
[37:15] they wouldn't let anyone else come in
[37:17] the pest house because there is all
[37:20] kinds of jams flying around there and
[37:24] the people will take these jams and be
[37:26] sick praise the name of the Lord so the
[37:29] prophet is pointing us that this still
[37:33] Earth
[37:34] vessel is a past house it is full of
[37:38] diseases you heal you get healed of this
[37:41] one tomorrow you contact another it is
[37:44] the a vessel it is a best house praise
[37:48] the name of the Lord so this best house
[37:52] here does not you know change what God
[37:56] sees us in
[38:00] that is a great
[38:02] nugget this house does not change who we
[38:07] are in the sight of God I might be going
[38:11] through a disease today but yet in the
[38:13] sight of the Lord I'm his son I might be
[38:17] going through trials today but yet in
[38:20] the sight of the Lord I'm his precious
[38:23] son I might be going through troubles
[38:26] today but yet in the house of the Lord
[38:29] in the sight of the Lord I'm his
[38:31] precious son so the conditions that the
[38:34] best house is going through does it you
[38:37] know
[38:38] determine what God sees in you praise
[38:42] the name of the Lord he says now listen
[38:45] what the prophet says here in another
[38:48] message Israel and the church he says
[38:50] now if you just quit doing
[38:53] it because you know you ought to do it
[38:56] and quit doing it this and quit doing
[38:59] this that's a say that you haven't got
[39:02] nowhere yet when that thing becomes dead
[39:05] in you and the nature of it gone away
[39:29] the prophet
[39:31] says that when that thing becomes dead
[39:34] in
[39:35] you the nature of going away there is
[39:39] another person in there it can only
[39:43] produce the holy ghost that was in
[39:46] Christ in you produces the Christlike
[39:52] life nothing you do what he did he was
[39:57] that before the foundation of the
[40:02] world well I got saved because I qu
[40:06] smoking and then he says
[40:08] also the prophetes and says that wasn't
[40:12] why got
[40:13] said that wasn't why you got sa you you
[40:17] got sa because God chose you before the
[40:20] foundation of the praise the name of the
[40:22] Lord to be saved that is the scripture
[40:26] teaching
[40:28] amen now you
[40:30] see we begin to find out it's not us it
[40:35] is him he chose us when did he choose us
[40:40] even when we were still
[40:41] smoking he chose us and then the prophet
[40:45] says Abraham couldn't
[40:48] say bless God well bless God I come down
[40:53] from the Tower of
[40:55] Babylon hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[40:57] I got sa he wouldn't have saved the he
[41:01] would have saved the whole bunch then if
[41:04] that is the reason they done so the
[41:07] prophet is telling us if Abraham leaving
[41:10] the tower of
[41:12] babon was what saved
[41:15] him then God would have saved all of
[41:17] them praise the name of the Lord so the
[41:20] condition of
[41:21] Abraham isn't the reason he was saved
[41:25] the condition you know your this evening
[41:29] isn't the reason why yourself God
[41:31] elected you before the foundation of the
[41:33] world and that why you
[41:36] sitting praise the name of the Lord the
[41:39] prophet says he elected Abraham and that
[41:42] was the very beginning of our
[41:45] Salvation was given to man when he
[41:48] called him and elected him and
[41:50] predestinated him and gave him a promise
[41:53] and made a covenant with AB anded
[41:56] forever so this evening this AEL might
[42:01] be going through trials of time might be
[42:03] having a
[42:04] disease the P house this Earth anival
[42:09] they that treasure prise the name of the
[42:12] Lord that's why Paul says in the book of
[42:16] Acts
[42:17] 26 verse 22 having therefore obtained
[42:21] help of
[42:24] God help
[42:28] I continue this day witnessing both to
[42:32] small and
[42:33] great says it is not me that does the
[42:37] work this V can fail each day but the
[42:42] treasure that is
[42:43] in work praise the name of the Lord and
[42:47] then he says in verse 23 that Grace
[42:50] should suffer and that he should be
[42:52] first that should rise from the
[42:55] dead 26 ver
[43:00] 23 Acts chapter 26 verse 22 vers
[43:30] praise the name of the Lord so let's get
[43:32] back to our to our text this
[43:35] evening in the book of second
[43:37] Corinthians
[43:40] 4 the scripture told us for
[43:44] God who commanded the L to shine out of
[43:50] Darkness shed in our
[43:53] hearts now I want you to see this it is
[43:56] not the L that God
[43:59] created he says for God who
[44:03] commanded and then he says heart shined
[44:06] in our
[44:07] hearts so it is God that is shining in
[44:11] our hearts praise the name of the Lord
[44:14] and then he says to give the light of
[44:16] the
[44:17] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[44:22] face of Jesus
[44:23] Christ and then he says in verse seven
[44:27] but we have this
[44:29] treasure now Paul is talking about the
[44:32] treasure and this treasure here that is
[44:36] talking about is God shining in our
[44:39] hearts that he speaks about in verse
[44:43] that God is shining in our heart and
[44:46] that is the treasure that we have and
[44:48] now that treasure brings about the
[44:52] Excellence of the power of God is shown
[44:58] out through us not us
[45:02] ourselves but the glory of the Lord the
[45:06] of God so that's why I'm saying that God
[45:11] himself has shown in our heart it is not
[45:14] the light that he commanded to shine in
[45:17] the
[45:18] beginning we see on Earth theate God
[45:22] himself that's the treasure in us and
[45:25] Ron chter 5
[45:28] verse the scripture says and hope make
[45:31] not
[45:33] ashamed hope make us not
[45:37] ashamed because the love of
[45:39] God is shed abroad in our
[45:43] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[45:47] unto us so the love of God that is shown
[45:51] in our hearts that is sheded in our
[45:53] hearts com by the Holy Ghost
[45:57] praise the name of the Lord and now this
[45:59] Holy Ghost here comes in our hearts and
[46:03] brings all the attributes of God in our
[46:06] hearts praise the name of the Lord and
[46:09] that's why John says beloved let us love
[46:12] one another for love is of God love is
[46:17] of
[46:17] God he
[46:19] says that love is God so you got to be
[46:23] with God in your heart for you to have
[46:26] love in your heart and the prophet also
[46:29] says here I just want to bring it here
[46:32] where he says that uh in the message you
[46:33] must be born again he says but without
[46:37] that eternal
[46:38] life this Fellowship
[46:41] life it will F away praise the name of
[46:44] the Lord is that strange he says without
[46:48] that eternal
[46:49] life this Fellowship life it will F away
[46:54] because it had a beginning it will have
[46:57] but with eternal life can nor more die
[47:01] than Eternal eternity can
[47:04] itself and what is
[47:06] eternity A Perfect Circle A Perfect
[47:10] Circle that has no end just revolves it
[47:15] he started it laying around this way it
[47:18] will go through the
[47:20] table through the flow through the Earth
[47:24] it is still a perfect circle
[47:27] and God had no beginning had no end and
[47:31] when he puts that spirit in
[47:35] us the
[47:37] treasure he says when he puts that
[47:39] spirit in Us in this flesh that he has
[47:43] brought from the
[47:45] earth and our F love has become to a
[47:49] place that it is overr
[47:54] by then we go
[47:59] praise the name of the Lord he says when
[48:02] [Applause]
[48:03] the has been
[48:06] replaced and you know placed was placed
[48:10] was and
[48:15] over etal in
[48:20] this that's been F and BR from the
[48:23] earth praise the name of the lord' to
[48:27] allow the love of
[48:28] God we got to allow know The Treasure of
[48:32] the Holy
[48:33] Spirit shed in our
[48:36] hearts continue revealing the treasures
[48:38] of all the attributes of God in us daily
[48:43] you see you know because the failures
[48:46] may come but that doesn't change the
[48:49] attribute that is in your
[48:50] heart because it is not this
[48:53] flesh that is producing that something
[48:57] coming from inside is being shed by the
[49:00] holy GH praise the name of the Lord and
[49:04] Pastor Rec shared in the
[49:07] group a certain quot and that was a
[49:11] great nugget to me I just want to share
[49:14] it with he says the prophet says in the
[49:17] message they were to have
[49:19] Fellowship I would rather have a
[49:22] church listen just a moment I would
[49:25] rather have a
[49:27] church that knows nothing about any
[49:30] spiritual
[49:31] gift and just be in love with each
[49:35] other and with Christ I would rather
[49:38] have done than every
[49:41] gift GI operating in the church why
[49:47] because Love Is God
[49:49] himself you canot produce that
[49:52] love without having that treasure in
[49:55] your life
[49:57] without having that treasure in your
[49:59] heart praise the name of the Lord the
[50:02] prophet says where there is a gift there
[50:05] will be question but where there is love
[50:09] it is perfect why it is God himself he
[50:13] has come and start inside of you amid
[50:16] all
[50:17] trials all
[50:19] troubl love stays there is a
[50:23] Conant it is a Conant
[50:26] because God is constant in you prise the
[50:29] name of the Lord God has changed in our
[50:33] hearts theol ghost as the Holy Ghost he
[50:38] has shown in our
[50:39] heart as the Holy Ghost why one to
[50:44] reveal himself to the world praise the
[50:48] name of the Lord if you ever come across
[50:50] the message Christ the Myster of the of
[50:52] God
[50:54] revealed the prophet was talking about
[50:56] the three F
[51:00] purpose of Christ
[51:02] coming but now this
[51:05] evening I want us to take those
[51:07] threefold
[51:09] purposes as those are the
[51:12] reason why the Holy Ghost is shown in
[51:16] our because he want reveal
[51:19] himself the people around
[51:21] you God you know wants to use you
[51:26] to through
[51:28] you to speak to your neighbor for your
[51:31] neighbor to
[51:32] know indeed God is leaving and he's in
[51:36] the people then the other reason is for
[51:39] God to have the
[51:42] preeminence within you you see to to
[51:48] rule such that you can surrender to him
[51:51] when he's right in your heart that's why
[51:54] he comes as the hoost
[51:56] in you and then the third reason to
[51:59] restore his
[52:01] kingdom in your life to take out the F
[52:04] of Satan and build up his kingdom in you
[52:09] are the purposes why God want to dwell
[52:12] in you and why he has shown himself in
[52:16] you why he's in you praise the name of
[52:19] the Lord and when the scripture say that
[52:22] it is the holy ghost that is the
[52:24] channel that God is in your life the
[52:28] prophet says here that the Holy Ghost is
[52:31] not
[52:31] auth now listen here the prophet says in
[52:35] the message says we will see
[52:38] Jesus there is Dr Morris who was asking
[52:41] him why is
[52:43] Jesus and
[52:45] maybe maybe one of us is having this
[52:49] question the
[52:50] prophet but where is that
[52:54] Jesus Dr Morris reard
[52:59] the president of the great Sudan
[53:03] Mission the greatest in the
[53:05] world came to me recently and in the
[53:09] room and in the room and in the
[53:14] room he said brother Bram I have enough
[53:19] degrees with h
[53:21] de to your
[53:25] [Music]
[53:28] but he
[53:29] said he said but where is Christ in any
[53:34] of
[53:36] it has the teachers been
[53:39] wrong I said I would not wish to say
[53:43] that I said as a person with grammar
[53:47] school
[53:49] education I could not say that those
[53:52] great F teachers has been wrong
[53:56] but they've told you the
[53:58] truth but Christ doesn't go by
[54:02] degre that you get here through
[54:07] theology Christ is by
[54:09] fa he is not a
[54:12] myth he is a person and then he says the
[54:17] holy
[54:18] spirit is not a
[54:21] thought it is a
[54:23] person when he the Holy Ghost
[54:28] and he is a personal
[54:30] pronoun
[54:34] absolutely it's a person of Christ in
[54:36] the form of the Holy
[54:39] Spirit Jesus said I am the vine you are
[54:44] the branches now the vine does not bear
[54:47] fruit the branches bears
[54:50] fruit so therefore he has to use you and
[54:55] I and
[54:56] ey he says he has to use you and our
[55:03] eyes our
[55:05] lips our hearing our
[55:08] speech that is him speaking through
[55:11] us I am the vine he are the
[55:16] branches so it would be the ass of
[55:19] Christ in his
[55:20] people if you could see him acting today
[55:23] like he
[55:26] for it is a promise to his
[55:29] church in me and my word in you ask what
[55:34] you will oh so many thousand of promises
[55:37] could be quoted
[55:39] here is Christ in his church what we
[55:42] have did among all of
[55:45] us I suppose I'm in a mixed audience as
[55:48] usual but what we have did we have
[55:52] arated Christ with an intellectual
[55:54] conception of some historical God
[55:58] if he AAL
[56:02] godal
[56:05] God what good will he do to
[56:09] us if he isn't the same God to this
[56:12] generation as he was at the apostolic
[56:16] age what good will that God of Moses do
[56:21] he what good would a healing God do that
[56:24] heal the sick back in him is and if he
[56:27] isn't the same
[56:31] today praise the name of the Lord so the
[56:34] prophet is showing us that this Christ
[56:39] here coming in Us in the form of the
[56:41] Holy
[56:42] Spirit it is not a thought that you say
[56:45] oh maybe I
[56:47] have it is a
[56:49] sure that you have it because of the
[56:52] life you
[56:53] live the prophet tells us that is not
[56:57] stimulation is not
[57:00] sensation it is the
[57:02] life that is the
[57:05] evidence life I may jump but yet the
[57:09] life doesn't take but the life of the
[57:12] holy spirit is the evidence that the
[57:15] person is in and he's working his way
[57:18] out PR the name of the Lord it is not
[57:22] here from
[57:23] outside and that's why our life is a
[57:28] the trials may come you know try to fail
[57:33] this yet because what is inside
[57:37] is our life doesn't
[57:40] change because we are not living our own
[57:42] life we are living the life of God
[57:46] that's why the prophet has told us that
[57:49] what we see with our eyes what how we
[57:52] use our
[57:53] lips our mouth it is Christ because he's
[57:58] inside he has the
[58:01] preeminence praise the name of the Lord
[58:03] so that Christ ising through you and he
[58:07] is the reason why amidst all the trials
[58:12] around still strong
[58:15] and of the Lord what is the reason why
[58:19] amst all the diseases around you stand
[58:23] and say I'm Healed in the name of Jesus
[58:25] Christ
[58:27] listen the prophet says here in the of
[58:30] Jesus
[58:31] Christ he says the de of
[58:34] him who is he praise the name of the
[58:37] Lord he say some of them
[58:40] think little baby back there remember we
[58:43] are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:46] that is showed in our
[58:48] hearts that is shed in our heart where
[58:53] the scripture has told us that same God
[58:57] commanded the
[58:59] light been shown in our hearts that same
[59:03] God the that we are talking about and
[59:07] the prophet says he is the you know he
[59:09] says some of them think that that him a
[59:13] little back back
[59:15] there is the one that stood on the
[59:20] invisible the invisible
[59:24] platform reached out his hand
[59:27] and spoke and let be light now the
[59:31] prophet is
[59:32] trying that some people still see him in
[59:36] the
[59:37] mang and they say he's in the hands of
[59:39] the
[59:41] man us he is one that stood on the
[59:45] invisible platform and reached out his
[59:48] hand and spoke and say Let There be late
[59:53] and there was that was Jesus Jesus
[59:57] Christ he was in the world and the world
[1:00:00] was made by him and the world recognized
[1:00:04] him
[1:00:04] not he was and he is the de of God look
[1:00:09] what he did back there talk about the
[1:00:13] miraculous there you talk about shouting
[1:00:16] when he perform the miraculous things to
[1:00:19] make things which are
[1:00:20] now which was not SP and it was so
[1:00:26] power that same Christ hallelujah
[1:00:29] hallelujah let the
[1:00:30] fundamentalist let them people who deny
[1:00:33] the power of God say it is wrong but
[1:00:37] that same power that brought the world
[1:00:40] into existence is in those people that's
[1:00:44] the Holy Ghost praise the name of the
[1:00:46] Lord oh my that's right men and women is

[1:07:06] everything that Christ hasn't created
[1:07:10] you know that's the truth praise the
[1:07:12] name of the Lord so we have seen that
[1:07:16] Christ is dwelling in
[1:07:18] us and it is the it is the
[1:07:22] treasure that Paul talks about talks
[1:07:25] about you know being

[1:07:45] defeated yes sir

[1:07:51] scripture
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:08:10] let's go to the book of second
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:20] Timothy on chapter 3
[1:08:25] let's begin from
[1:08:32] first but thou Hast fully known my
[1:08:36] [Music]
[1:08:41] Doctrine manner of
[1:08:43] life
[1:08:45] purpose fa long suffering Char
[1:08:51] patience
[1:08:53] 11 persecutions
[1:08:58] came unto me at
[1:09:03] anti
[1:09:08] Anon
[1:09:09] atra what persecutions I
[1:09:13] endured but out of them
[1:09:17] all the Lord delivered
[1:09:21] me did you overcome them by himself
[1:09:25] he says the Lord delivered me where is
[1:09:29] he the treasure in this vessel praise
[1:09:34] the name of the Lord as I try to finish
[1:09:37] here let's just look at where the
[1:09:40] Prophet is talking about
[1:09:42] here you see job
[1:09:44] also was a little bit
[1:09:47] confused because things were not moving
[1:09:50] on Camp us
[1:09:53] around trials
[1:09:55] that many times I asked my brothers and
[1:09:58] sisters that if you stood in the feet of
[1:10:01] job what would you do but the prophet
[1:10:04] says in the message go tell my
[1:10:08] disciples go tell my
[1:10:10] disciples and then paragraph 43 I think
[1:10:14] of
[1:10:16] prophet job when he said there at that
[1:10:20] time and he knew he was
[1:10:23] going he spoke of the Great someone
[1:10:26] there that we get from Job
[1:10:29] 14 how he watched
[1:10:32] flowers how they died and
[1:10:35] R how he washed the trees if it blows
[1:10:39] over tears down the wind tears up the
[1:10:44] wind tears
[1:10:46] up in
[1:10:48] depth in death rather in
[1:10:51] death yet it lives a g
[1:10:55] he said through a few
[1:10:59] drops he says it lives we watch our
[1:11:04] animals and so forth as they and as they
[1:11:07] live and
[1:11:08] die everything that has a moving
[1:11:12] being about
[1:11:14] it when it dies it never lives
[1:11:19] normal so job wondered how it was that
[1:11:22] God could take a flower
[1:11:26] and make it live again and yet he
[1:11:28] couldn't live
[1:11:30] again that is job he wondered why God
[1:11:35] allows the flower to live
[1:11:39] again he has not allowed job
[1:11:42] himself man in
[1:11:45] this again and the prophet and says
[1:11:49] couldn't live
[1:11:51] again he said a man give up the ghost
[1:11:57] he was
[1:11:58] away and where is he he said his sons
[1:12:03] come to honor
[1:12:05] him but he perceive it not then he said
[1:12:10] oh that would that thou would hide me in
[1:12:12] the
[1:12:14] grave and th would keep me in a secret
[1:12:17] place until they wrath be passed th
[1:12:21] appoint me at times and Bs
[1:12:25] and
[1:12:26] Bones I cannot pass but if thou would
[1:12:31] just keep me in the secret
[1:12:33] place the day of
[1:12:35] the right in the midst of
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:39] his right well the very darkest of the
[1:12:43] hour
[1:12:44] was well the very dark of the
[1:12:49] hour just in that crucial
[1:12:53] moment then
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] and begin to speak to him telling him
[1:13:03] that the flower had not
[1:13:06] sinned that he was the one that sin and
[1:13:09] there would be a
[1:13:12] resurrection someday there would be a
[1:13:15] just one who would
[1:13:19] come made conformable to this
[1:13:22] world and in the form of God's image
[1:13:26] after after the fashion of
[1:13:28] man praise the name of the Lord so here
[1:13:31] that
[1:13:34] came was telling that it is because of
[1:13:38] your
[1:13:38] sins that you're going through this that
[1:13:41] is because of the sins that you will not
[1:13:45] resurrect and the prophet continues here
[1:13:47] and says and when job saw that he was
[1:13:51] looking to the resurrection of the
[1:13:53] Lord saw it
[1:13:55] now notice in other words job was trying
[1:14:00] to get this that I know that when a man
[1:14:03] goes to the dust of the
[1:14:05] earth he just contaminates and goes
[1:14:08] away I watch him he never raises a g he
[1:14:14] just lays down and gives up the
[1:14:18] goost before
[1:14:20] realizing that in him was a
[1:14:23] treasure he thought that when he's going
[1:14:26] to die he will not come up
[1:14:29] again praise the name of the Lord and
[1:14:31] then he says in paragraph
[1:14:34] 47 there then he says then when this
[1:14:38] prophet got in the
[1:14:41] spirit God begin to show him what was
[1:14:43] going to take
[1:14:45] place that there would be
[1:14:47] someone who would take away the sin of
[1:14:50] the world and raise a again he saw the
[1:14:53] resurrection of the Lord
[1:14:55] then I love
[1:14:56] that when I think he said stood up he
[1:15:02] shook himself he would been sitting on
[1:15:04] our ship my what we call
[1:15:08] today had hit his house his children was
[1:15:12] all killed his riches was all gone his
[1:15:16] health had broken down him
[1:15:19] sitting a Christian or
[1:15:22] believer sitting for
[1:15:26] seconden for
[1:15:28] seconden a man even his
[1:15:31] church had turned there back on
[1:15:34] him sitting there scrapping his bra at
[1:15:39] the condition of Jo and the prophet says
[1:15:42] and then when the spirit of the Lord
[1:15:44] Came
[1:15:48] Upon you know he stood up and he said I
[1:15:53] know my redeemer
[1:15:55] and at the last days he will stand on
[1:15:57] the earth and though the skin ones
[1:16:01] destroyed this body yet in my flesh
[1:16:04] shall I see God whom I shall see he knew
[1:16:08] he would see him the last day because
[1:16:12] there would be a resurrection how about
[1:16:15] us who are living in the present you
[1:16:17] know you know revealed
[1:16:19] what where the holy spirit is given
[1:16:22] before them the Holy Spirit was not
[1:16:24] given
[1:16:25] here the treasure is dwelling right us
[1:16:29] Christ in his people doing his work
[1:16:32] praise the name of the
[1:16:34] Lord we might be going through different
[1:16:37] trials but the treasure the anchor is
[1:16:42] holding so I just want to
[1:16:45] encourage that the
[1:16:47] treasure that is in this
[1:16:49] body is what keeps us
[1:16:52] going you see when you look at the
[1:16:55] scriptures you may wonder
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:00] why for all the treasures in
[1:17:04] Egypt and he suffered with with God's
[1:17:07] people may
[1:17:09] wonder what what what happen to
[1:17:12] David when he came to the brothers in
[1:17:16] the
[1:17:17] Battleground and his his his you know
[1:17:19] his
[1:17:20] Revelation wasn't the army of s
[1:17:25] it wasn't the army
[1:17:27] of it was the army of the Living
[1:17:30] God why he had the
[1:17:33] Revelation there is a treasure there is
[1:17:36] a God and this evening what we need to
[1:17:40] know that in Us in this body that suffer
[1:17:45] sickness in this body you know that
[1:17:50] is that fails there is a treasure the
[1:17:55] holy spirit is shown in us and that Holy
[1:17:59] Spirit does not
[1:18:01] fail ConEd everything the prophet says
[1:18:06] that Christ conquered
[1:18:08] everything just in us to fulfill all
[1:18:12] that is done praise the name of the Lord
[1:18:16] so you wonder why Paul such a great
[1:18:22] Apostle stands in Romans 7
[1:18:26] when I want to
[1:18:29] good but how did you
[1:18:32] overc by the treasure in
[1:18:36] theel let's just sing one more song
[1:18:40] here then we shall pray each one of us
[1:18:44] as we appreciate God for the treasure
[1:18:52] in praise the name of the Lord

[1:18:57] know that in this pest
[1:19:02] house there is a great
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:05] treasure and every time we should think
[1:19:07] about
[1:19:09] that we should give God the
[1:19:11] glory because he knew that we can't
[1:19:15] overcome and then the scripture says
[1:19:18] that there is nothing that comes your
[1:19:20] way except
[1:19:22] he the de
[1:19:25] that is dwelling in you so that he will
