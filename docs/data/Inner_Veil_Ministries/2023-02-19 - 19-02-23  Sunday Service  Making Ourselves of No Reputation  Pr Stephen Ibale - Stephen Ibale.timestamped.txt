[23:04] [Music]

[23:20] return down
[23:22] [Music]
[23:38] a child of a king
[23:44] [Music]
[23:46] savior
[23:49] [Music]
[23:57] [Music]
[24:01] why
[24:03] should I care
[24:11] for
[24:13] me over there no
[24:18] exiled from home yes
[24:24] [Music]
[24:32] I'm a child of the king I'm a child of a
[24:41] king
[24:45] [Music]
[24:48] with Jesus
[24:53] [Music]
[25:01] what's up another king
[25:04] a child of a king
[25:09] with Jesus
[25:13] [Music]
[25:27] amen Amina are you a child of the king
[25:31] then give the Lord the hand of praise
[25:35] [Applause]
[25:44] that Christianity goes a lot farther
[25:48] than what we know
[25:51] because it's an expression of life
[25:56] is Christ controlling from the throne on
[26:00] the inside
[26:02] so it goes further than just a belief
[26:07] system
[26:10] it's allowing oneself to become a
[26:14] reflector
[26:20] and the Christian Life
[26:22] is living out the nature and character
[26:25] of Christ
[26:29] holding the right doctrine of the
[26:31] message
[26:34] without the spirit that brought that
[26:37] message
[26:40] it doesn't make you a Believer
[26:43] Amen to be a believer
[26:47] the ability to release life from the
[26:51] inside
[26:56] amen you're drinking the word
[27:15] [Music]
[27:18] we just have to step into his spirit
[27:22] amen because remember John was not
[27:25] talking about being in his own spirit
[27:30] because that wouldn't have brought those
[27:32] Visions
[27:34] it had to be the spirit of God
[27:37] and as we are here this morning it has
[27:41] to be the spirit of God With Us
[27:47] walking to church or driving to church
[27:50] we mean nothing
[27:52] because
[27:55] if there's anything good that will come
[27:58] to me
[28:17] is summed up as a Divine manifestation
[28:27] so when Divine faith and the Holy Ghost
[28:31] mixes with what we believe
[28:35] we become kindness foreign
[29:19] feet and go to Philippians chapter 2.
[29:25] so that the spirit may speak to us this
[29:28] morning
[29:30] amen Amina Philippians
[29:35] and before we read that character let's
[29:38] just buy heads in order prayer
[29:49] because you allow us special moments
[29:52] like this
[29:55] when we come together rejoicing and
[29:58] praising your name
[30:01] and you pour in your blessings in the
[30:04] teaching of the world
[30:07] so in moments like this father
[30:11] we always just desire to surrender
[30:15] to pour out ourselves heavenly father
[30:20] but we may have a supernatural
[30:23] fellowship with you today
[30:26] we could have questions
[30:30] [Music]
[30:32] we could have desires in our lives
[30:41] know how to take care of them
[30:43] so I pray for your children that you may
[30:47] give them the spiritual peace
[31:00] that Lord I may still be able to
[31:02] communicate to your children
[31:05] bless brother James
[31:07] in Jesus name amen amen
[31:20] sorry we have not read the scripture
[31:23] you get down here you get lost sometimes
[31:27] so Philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[31:36] he says let this mind be in you which
[31:39] was also in Christ Jesus
[31:42] Christ
[31:46] let that one become a permanent
[31:50] statement in your life
[31:54] when you think
[31:56] when you plan
[31:59] let this mind be new like
[32:05] who being in the form of God thought it
[32:08] not Rubble to be equal with God
[32:19] but made himself of no reputation
[32:23] and took upon him the form of the
[32:26] servant and was made in the likeness of
[32:31] men he was not a man he was more than
[32:35] that he was made in the likeliness of
[32:38] men too
[32:48] he was not a man Thierry Montu he was in
[32:52] the image
[32:55] there was something more than what we
[32:58] are yeah
[33:00] and being found in fashion as a man
[33:06] is
[33:09] himself and became obedient after death
[33:16] even the death of the Cross
[33:21] wherefore God also has highly exalted
[33:26] him
[33:31] which is above every name
[33:37] and I think we understand that very well
[33:41] he gave him a quality of character
[33:47] which was higher than all creation
[33:52] that by the authority of that character
[33:58] every name
[34:04] amen Amina the Western here
[34:08] that at the name of Jesus
[34:11] everyness of the bow of things in heaven
[34:14] and things in us and things under the
[34:18] Earth
[34:20] yes
[34:23] [Music]
[34:26] and that every tongue should confess
[34:29] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[34:32] of the father
[34:35] Yes Crystal yeah
[34:39] may the Lord that blessing the reading
[34:42] of his wife
[34:48] amen Amina so verse 7 says
[34:53] he made himself of no reputation
[34:59] and I want to take our title from that
[35:04] very Versace
[35:06] making ourselves
[35:13] made himself of no reputation yes
[35:20] and from there
[35:22] we want to make ourselves of no
[35:25] reputation
[35:28] amen so reputation
[35:32] speaks of the status which is rightly
[35:36] accorded
[35:39] and you know that status is real it is
[35:45] therefore making oneself of no
[35:48] reputation
[35:51] you know it speaks of taking a lower
[35:55] status
[35:58] then what is rightly accorded to you
[36:05] you know all best
[36:09] but then you take some form of humility
[36:14] I wait towards her you know to make
[36:17] yourself like the rest of the people
[36:22] it's making yourself of no repeaters
[36:27] it is making oneself void of special
[36:33] statuses
[36:39] so for example if president comes here
[36:48] he carries the form of Honor around him
[36:55] and everybody we honestly look at it and
[37:01] understanding
[37:04] that was the same where the Lord was
[37:08] when he came down in the body of Flesh
[37:11] yes
[37:12] but the Bible says he made himself of no
[37:17] reputation
[37:19] listen now but what did he say he did
[37:22] not make the set of films visible
[37:26] that we're always surrounding him
[37:31] the cherubims were not visible but
[37:35] as they were there
[37:39] amen but they were not visible
[37:43] are you together with me so even moments
[37:48] when he was challenged
[37:51] in not pull that authority of the Angels
[37:56] amen I mean one time when he was
[38:00] challenged at the end of his Athletics
[38:06] he said he could have even summoned a
[38:10] legend of angels
[38:12] foreign
[38:27] [Music]
[38:53] [Music]
[39:40] [Music]
[39:54] [Music]
[40:00] [Music]
[40:09] You Know Who You Are the form of Anthony
[40:13] accolades
[40:16] but for the cause of redemption
[40:20] you take a lower estate
[40:24] to allow the holy ghosts
[40:27] the work of redemption
[40:32] to perform a Redemption
[40:35] he made himself of no reputation
[40:46] he became a Kinsman yeah
[40:50] because the law required
[40:55] in order to redeem
[40:59] are you together with me so he had to
[41:03] become like one of us
[41:07] [Music]
[41:10] he had to come with
[41:14] [Music]
[41:22] [Music]
[41:40] and verse 9.
[41:43] foreign
[41:45] he says but we see Jesus who has made a
[41:50] little lower than the angels for the
[41:52] suffering of death
[42:01] amen amen for the suffering of death
[42:07] amen he became lower than the angels
[42:16] and the purpose was to die
[42:21] amen amen then he was crowned with Glory
[42:25] and Honor that
[42:30] he by the grace of God should test death
[42:34] for everyone
[42:47] so we see the scripture says
[42:51] 2K16 organic element body yet
[42:55] [Music]
[42:57] for the suffering of death
[43:01] that he may test death for every man I
[43:06] went to Africa
[43:08] it doesn't matter what condition you
[43:11] were in was 10 45
[43:14] you qualify
[43:16] that Jesus died for you yes
[43:20] he tested that for you yes
[43:28] that by the grace of God to reached he
[43:33] should test this
[43:36] to his body
[43:38] and then release his life
[43:42] amen for men

[45:02] oh

[45:25] the festival Africa so we all become one
[45:31] penetrate and therefore according to
[45:35] that we are all Brethren is
[45:41] by the same spirit
[45:44] that came down to him or in the Jordan
[45:47] River
[45:50] and then came to the church on the day
[45:54] of
[45:54] um
[45:57] he's the first born
[46:01] amen Amina among the brothers
[46:06] he became an evil Redeemer yeah
[46:11] the Bible calls them the grow well
[46:16] Amen brother Branham

[46:25] Korea

[47:12] [Music]
[47:25] himself into a micro organ yet
[47:32] to bring Redemption
[47:35] amen Amina do you understand what I'm
[47:38] saying
[47:39] when you look up here
[47:41] brother tells us
[47:44] to come from one star to another stand
[47:49] it's millions of light years
[47:57] and yet the light is so fast
[48:02] but then you multiply that is
[48:18] 24.
[48:20] to get uh uh

[48:50] created a very vast space
[48:57] you go past the
[49:22] and released himself in the blood
[49:26] cells
[49:28] and then created a little egg yeah
[49:32] are you together with me
[49:35] to the womb of the Virgin
[49:39] and then he was born
[49:44] amen but when he comes down
[49:48] nobody knew he was the creator of the
[49:51] heavens
[49:53] when he went to the house of Simon
[49:56] they disregarded his presence foreign
[49:59] [Music]
[50:32] [Music]
[50:42] [Music]
[50:58] able to praise that before you this
[51:01] morning
[51:03] there was no reputation
[51:06] when you land obedience
[51:09] by the things which he suffered already
[51:13] in order to build the characters
[51:18] [Music]
[51:20] but the moment you know we get into this
[51:24] body of Flesh
[51:26] there is always the pool of sin upon the
[51:30] world
[51:32] are you together with me even Jesus
[51:36] Christ we suffered exactly the same
[51:40] and the only way
[51:43] character can be built and there is
[51:46] when we are in this particular body like
[51:49] original is God allowing us to go
[51:53] through chastisements
[51:56] amen Amina through the things we suffer
[51:59] already
[52:00] there was no reputation why was that
[52:04] when he pitched his tents

[53:33] [Music]
[53:39] and the man said
[53:44] every verse than that one is
[53:49] reputation
[53:51] if we continue declaring it again he
[53:55] would have not been cleansed
[53:57] because the Divine destruction
[54:01] was to go into Jordan
[54:05] and then he wins the first time yeah
[54:13] it became like that
[54:18] you take your reputation
[54:21] you have no Pact
[54:30] [Music]
[54:37] in order to take it
[54:46] [Music]
[55:01] you could have spent many years of
[55:03] education
[55:05] that's not your process or your path of
[55:08] redemption
[55:10] the path of redemption is
[55:13] we have to completely uh disregard to
[55:19] Renewables
[55:26] that's not what you use in Redemption
[55:31] amen now questions and answers of 54.
[55:38] he says I believe that the image that
[55:41] foreign
[56:02] and
[56:11] [Music]
[56:16] no one after Daniel had been thrown in
[56:20] the Lion's Den in hours
[56:26] no one should deserve any other God
[56:30] is
[56:33] God I cartooned about Daniel it was
[56:36] probably the image of a holy man
[56:43] and everybody was to bow down to this
[56:49] but the church
[56:52] Hallelujah somebody say Amen
[56:56] but the church
[57:03] Daniel being the leader
[57:06] as Christ being the leader of the church
[57:10] and they was to Bow before this image
[57:14] foreign
[57:42] [Music]
[57:47] foreign
[58:15] are together with it and so now the king

[1:00:46] understand this is
[1:00:47] at the end is a similar thing will come
[1:00:52] back
[1:00:54] trying to force the children of God
[1:01:06] but one thing about Daniel Daniel
[1:01:10] did not bow before his Daniel
[1:01:15] he had made himself of no repeaters
[1:01:19] he was not part of the image that they
[1:01:23] were making
[1:01:25] financially amen amen and brother
[1:01:28] Branham an organ in the Bruce disciples
[1:01:35] fought that Spirit of taking him out of
[1:01:38] his position
[1:01:41] I'm trying to make him higher
[1:01:45] because they had seen the Miracles
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:54] the people had walked out of wheelchairs
[1:02:06] Crystal

[1:02:23] he said the same thing
[1:02:27] but actually challenge Daniel is
[1:02:31] going to come back in the entertainment
[1:02:36] are you together with me but brother
[1:02:38] brother miss our brother
[1:02:41] we don't give him a position higher than
[1:02:44] that
[1:02:45] amen I mean he says here in the Bruce
[1:02:48] Sabbath message
[1:02:51] and the thing I always wanted to be you
[1:02:55] know is
[1:02:56] and desires of my heart today
[1:03:01] it was the true servant of Jesus Christ
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:09] I want my testimony to be
[1:03:13] cleaning that in all my mistakes
[1:03:19] I yet love them with all my heart
[1:03:23] and I do this morning with all my heart
[1:03:28] and because of that it forces me to say
[1:03:36] I am leaving the ministry
[1:03:40] is because that there is something arose
[1:03:44] among the people
[1:03:46] that's caused me to do it
[1:03:49] but I have been taken from my bracket as
[1:03:53] a Ministry
[1:03:58] and being called Jesus Christ foreign
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:19] amen you see the prophet says the same
[1:04:23] thing will come back
[1:04:27] the challenge of Daniel
[1:04:30] they build an image Finance Daniel to
[1:04:35] Bow before that
[1:04:38] would not bow before his own name
[1:04:48] is
[1:05:08] they said Daniel is our brothers
[1:05:12] Daniel is not our God Daniel Tiger is
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:22] so God
[1:05:25] is
[1:06:01] that this belongs to God
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:45] the more you go get closer to God
[1:06:49] as a Believer is the more you are going
[1:06:52] to become humble
[1:06:55] making ourselves
[1:07:05] but today men are making their own
[1:07:09] images
[1:07:17] I am the standard in Chinese
[1:07:23] you've seen many kids shoes
[1:07:28] you know themselves images
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:54] they are the ones doing back to the
[1:07:56] furnaces of fire
[1:07:58] because
[1:08:02] we are not going to allow those people
[1:08:04] to Fellowship you see what I mean people
[1:08:08] are making different images
[1:08:10] but he made himself of no reputation
[1:08:15] in order to get gave us the Redemption
[1:08:19] and we also should make ourselves of no
[1:08:23] reputation
[1:08:26] I mean of that Redemption
[1:08:29] because it must be the same nature
[1:08:33] of the dove away
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:45] Christ is the nature of the dark
[1:08:47] Christian
[1:08:49] and a True Believers
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:09:00] that you can even give his life as a
[1:09:03] sacrifice
[1:09:06] that's why when Jesus came
[1:09:09] he was referred to as the Lamb of God
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:10:13] let's go to Isaiah chapter 14 here
[1:10:17] foreign
[1:10:23] Isaiah chapter 14 here
[1:10:25] the verses we are going to read and he
[1:10:28] related to your summer they speak about
[1:10:31] Lucifer together crucifer Lucifer had
[1:10:35] been honored Lucifer yelling away and he
[1:10:39] was the head of the worship team in
[1:10:41] heaven our sins so he would play
[1:10:45] wonderful music
[1:10:48] amen I mean and the wall of Heaven
[1:10:53] hallelujah
[1:10:57] hallelujah
[1:11:03] now that brought a lot of Glory
[1:11:08] but Lucifer Lucifer wanted to share of
[1:11:12] the glory yeah
[1:11:14] so he wanted to assume a reputation
[1:11:18] which
[1:11:21] reputation was for God
[1:11:24] so in Isaiah chapter 14.
[1:11:28] he says
[1:11:33] praise the Lord
[1:11:35] spoken is that yeah it was not exhibited
[1:11:40] we come back
[1:11:45] that was something in his eyes
[1:11:48] it was the condition of his heart
[1:11:51] and in that heart there is
[1:11:54] a lot of eyes
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:28] he lost his Redemption
[1:12:31] because he was not satisfied with where
[1:12:35] God blessed
[1:12:42] his fall originated from the condition
[1:12:45] of the house
[1:12:48] because the desires
[1:13:22] a man of God who is powerful
[1:13:26] that was the problem of listening
[1:13:29] Lucifer what God desire of us
[1:13:33] is to count ourselves of no reputation
[1:13:39] amen amen when the Lord took the human
[1:13:42] abroad of Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ of redemption
[1:13:48] he stayed in his commission yesterday
[1:13:54] as he was going to bring the redempts
[1:14:02] because he could not abide in his
[1:14:05] position
[1:14:08] the Lord said unto my Lord
[1:14:12] sit down at my right hand
[1:14:15] until I make my thy enemies
[1:14:23] he never crossed the borders
[1:14:26] he took the position
[1:14:29] sit down at myself
[1:14:34] he was God
[1:14:37] as Paul says
[1:14:39] but he did not take the position of God
[1:14:46] foreign
[1:15:20] amen I mean he said I do nothing
[1:15:25] amen of myself but as my father has told
[1:15:30] me
[1:15:34] he could not bring things
[1:15:37] out of their season movies
[1:15:51] what God has called us
[1:15:54] and stay in a state of humility
[1:15:58] and then he says and he that sent me
[1:16:04] is with me
[1:16:06] the father has not let me alone
[1:16:12] for I always do those things that please
[1:16:40] foreign amen Amina
[1:16:43] so now
[1:16:45] listen
[1:16:47] Jesus told the Beatitudes yes
[1:17:06] he was teaching the Beatitudes
[1:17:10] actually the Christ that way was
[1:17:13] commanding those that have done away
[1:17:16] with their self-assumed reputation
[1:17:25] so that the glory of God
[1:17:31] blessed are the hungry
[1:17:37] blessed are the peacemakers
[1:17:41] are you together with me this is a man
[1:17:44] the Christians they are not looking for
[1:17:48] preeminists
[1:17:50] and once you get into that kind of form
[1:17:54] and condition of life
[1:18:13] this year
[1:18:16] you know we are in the lordician church
[1:18:21] the last Church
[1:18:24] which puts Christ out of the church yes
[1:18:30] amen Amina and we know that the glory of
[1:18:35] God
[1:18:36] has been put out for drama
[1:18:41] Tomatoes
[1:18:43] amen Amina man do all kinds of uh uh
[1:18:48] Hollywood
[1:18:53] and people go to church because that's
[1:18:56] what they want to see it happens
[1:18:59] but their pasta can be funny
[1:19:04] and when it begins to be funny
[1:19:12] that's what they would go to church
[1:19:15] the age foreign
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:19] and then foreign
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:31] are you together with me yeah Moses had
[1:20:36] took them to give put them away the
[1:20:38] darkness of their hearts Moses
[1:20:49] but he says but now I see
[1:20:53] if you put away it will go back a wife
[1:20:57] for every cause
[1:20:59] why does Jesus say so right she is he
[1:21:03] was greater than Moses Musa
[1:21:10] where the Bible says Bible recover I've
[1:21:14] refused the woman to teach
[1:21:18] but then those people come I have on
[1:21:21] trouble by them let them
[1:21:23] teaching do you know what that means
[1:21:26] they are greater than Christ single
[1:21:29] Christian they assume the glory
[1:21:32] they assume the honor but
[1:21:35] of judgment
[1:21:39] are you together with me yes so they put
[1:21:43] our Christ with Christopher now they own
[1:21:46] the church
[1:21:47] the angel of the Church of the Lord this
[1:21:51] is
[1:21:53] so by looking at this location
[1:21:58] they trusted in themselves
[1:22:02] like the Rich Young rulers
[1:22:29] he couldn't
[1:22:31] count himself of narrative
[1:22:35] are you together
[1:22:40] all your ideas
[1:22:43] he says
[1:22:47] this church of Lord this year and you
[1:22:50] can say they needed something to hold on
[1:22:55] they thought the grace of God was not
[1:22:59] enough
[1:23:03] and because they could not make
[1:23:05] themselves of no repeaters
[1:23:08] they counted themselves Unworthy of
[1:23:12] eternal life
[1:23:15] they walked away but from
[1:23:19] eternal life
[1:23:20] they walked away
[1:23:23] from the fullness of redemption
[1:23:26] when Christ stepped out saying yes
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:38] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:23:42] they walked away from that okay
[1:23:46] and yet Jesus said come I think and he
[1:23:50] was presenting himself as the amen of
[1:23:53] God
[1:23:56] the soul let it be the cultivation the
[1:24:01] faithful and true witness
[1:24:02] um
[1:24:03] foreign
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:19] he says me all these standards that
[1:24:22] don't know
[1:24:24] who are you
[1:24:26] diwani I am the amen the true and
[1:24:29] faithful um
[1:24:38] they'll have something that they were
[1:24:40] holding up
[1:24:42] they had some form of a reputation
[1:24:45] but they couldn't let go
[1:24:48] he had stepped out at the manifestation
[1:24:52] of the entire
[1:24:55] work of redemption
[1:24:58] the summation of it all the alpha and
[1:25:02] Amiga
[1:25:05] they didn't know they were rejecting the
[1:25:07] talking life himself
[1:25:11] are you together
[1:25:13] amen that's the Church of Lord this is
[1:25:21] because they do not want to count
[1:25:25] themselves
[1:25:31] he did not want to lose reputation
[1:25:35] God tells them going to a plane this way
[1:25:39] he says but there is that City yeah
[1:25:45] how many times do we reason with God
[1:25:50] and he's so vividual
[1:25:54] God Has Come Away sometimes
[1:25:57] but we keep listening with him
[1:26:01] not to want to be counted of no
[1:26:03] reputation
[1:26:08] foreign
[1:26:17] are you together with it same man under
[1:26:20] here
[1:26:21] yes sir I mean now listen to the
[1:26:24] audition uh from the lordistian church
[1:26:29] this thing says the faithful and true
[1:26:33] witness
[1:26:36] now I want to show you what I find in
[1:26:40] the thought of faithfulness
[1:26:44] you know we often talk about a great and
[1:26:48] changing God together
[1:26:51] whose word does not change
[1:26:55] and when we speak of him after the
[1:26:58] manner we often get a view of him
[1:27:06] that makes him seem very impossible
[1:27:13] it is as though God made the world
[1:27:16] universe
[1:27:19] and all the laws that pertain to it
[1:27:23] and then straight back
[1:27:33] it is as though God made the way of
[1:27:36] salvation for lost mankind
[1:27:41] that way being at the cross
[1:27:45] and then when the death of Christ has
[1:27:50] attuned our sins
[1:27:54] and this Resurrection gave us an open
[1:27:57] door to him
[1:28:01] then God forwarded his arms
[1:28:08] it's as if we imagine believing in a
[1:28:12] great Creator
[1:28:16] who have been created
[1:28:19] lost personal interest in his grace
[1:28:25] now I said that is how too many people
[1:28:29] are up to think
[1:28:32] but that's the wrong of thinking
[1:28:35] for God is governing in the Affairs of
[1:28:39] men right now
[1:28:42] he is
[1:28:50] are you together with me chaos
[1:28:53] you're fine you know when you go home
[1:28:57] he cares a fire when you close your
[1:29:00] doors we got our original he cares a
[1:29:03] fire when you go to work
[1:29:06] he cares when you get sick he cares when
[1:29:12] you have questions
[1:29:15] when you are in a condition of stress
[1:29:31] thinking that maybe God doesn't care
[1:29:34] and then you want to have your own way
[1:29:39] listen what did he say the prophet
[1:29:42] coaches say this
[1:29:45] chapter 1 verse 16.
[1:29:50] for by him when all things created
[1:29:55] in heaven
[1:29:59] this is the one invisible everybody
[1:30:01] whether they be thrown or dominions
[1:30:08] all
[1:30:09] things were created by Him
[1:30:12] and for him
[1:30:15] and he is before all things
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:26] by his own castle
[1:30:29] he purposed the plan for salvation
[1:30:32] foreign
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:31:14] is on right now
[1:31:17] as the great Shepherd of the ship
[1:31:22] he is very existence
[1:31:25] is for his own
[1:31:28] he loves them I mean they know and he
[1:31:32] cares for them
[1:31:33] is
[1:31:36] never upon them
[1:31:38] when the word says
[1:31:41] your lives are hidden Christ in God
[1:31:45] it means exactly what it says
[1:31:49] oh I am so glad that my God abides
[1:31:54] faithful
[1:31:55] he is true to himself
[1:31:58] he won't lie he is true to the world
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:08] he will lose
[1:32:11] but raise us up in the last day I am I
[1:32:15] am glad that I'm resting in his
[1:32:17] faithfulness
[1:32:20] amen are you together with me you see he
[1:32:25] came out yeah
[1:32:28] and knocked at the door yeah
[1:32:31] Lord this year the Lord is here open the
[1:32:34] door
[1:32:35] and then the priests in the Lord this
[1:32:38] year
[1:32:40] they say who are you Babu Jesus
[1:32:47] what is it trying to do
[1:32:49] he's trying to tell them that I am the
[1:32:53] one Denise completing my psycho of
[1:32:57] redemption
[1:33:00] I am the true and faithful
[1:33:04] meaning that I'm no longer
[1:33:08] origin
[1:33:34] foreign
[1:33:51] they began to say I think God doesn't
[1:33:54] care about us
[1:33:57] like the people are saying now
[1:34:00] I think God has forgotten us
[1:34:04] look at what this Sodom condition is
[1:34:18] yeah because they want to retain
[1:34:22] their reputation
[1:34:27] Philippians 1 6.
[1:34:30] being confident of this very thing
[1:34:35] that he which began a good work in you
[1:34:40] will perform it until the day of Christ
[1:34:54] amen just stay
[1:34:57] Amina
[1:35:21] and told them I'm the true witness
[1:35:24] the prophet says
[1:35:27] he is the true witness
[1:35:30] now this was true
[1:35:34] is the same word we saw back in
[1:35:37] Revelation 3 7.
[1:35:40] you recall that it does not mean teach
[1:35:44] together
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] together
[1:35:50] as a contrast with forms
[1:36:00] it has a richer deeper meaning
[1:36:06] it expresses perfect realization
[1:36:13] amen Amina
[1:36:15] in contrast to partial realization
[1:36:20] now back in the Philadelphia News
[1:36:23] Philadelphia the coming of the Lord was
[1:36:26] growing in eye
[1:36:29] what great love that age manifested for
[1:36:32] him
[1:36:35] coming was drawing
[1:36:39] but now when the age of Lord this is
[1:36:45] he now comes and says I am the truth is
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:57] for you to understand the word
[1:37:02] don't you think it is fighting a fourth
[1:37:05] thing is
[1:37:16] like we have a lamp here is
[1:37:28] but when Jesus comes
[1:37:31] and John is calling him the Lamb of God
[1:37:35] you can't wait
[1:37:37] he is
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:49] telling the Lord this
[1:37:51] is the time of the fulfillments
[1:37:56] all things
[1:38:05] he was standing in face to the wealth of
[1:38:10] all what the Bible held inside
[1:38:18] and that's what what God wants to show
[1:38:21] us
[1:38:23] all the shadows of time
[1:38:26] we're washing away
[1:38:33] come on now
[1:38:38] amen Amina that's the age of lotus
[1:38:43] we are now not going to have him by
[1:38:46] friends
[1:38:48] but he was going to come as a
[1:38:50] manifestation
[1:38:53] but they walked away
[1:38:56] from the coming manifestation of the
[1:38:59] foreign
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:21] getting away from the Shadows
[1:39:25] to stand in the presence
[1:39:29] we were being introduced to the person
[1:39:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:36] in the presence of the Lord
[1:39:42] that was going to manifest the second
[1:39:44] company
[1:39:53] amen Amina but when Jesus came I
[1:39:57] yesterday what was the
[1:39:59] pop challenge again the Bible calls him
[1:40:01] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:40:05] that's what they rejected they rejected
[1:40:09] to the manifestation of the first born
[1:40:13] which means that we are not part of your
[1:40:16] family
[1:40:18] are you together
[1:40:19] because they were literally saying oh we
[1:40:23] are not part of that Christians over
[1:40:27] foreign
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:46] listen now 2017. the beginning of the
[1:40:50] creation of God
[1:40:53] tonight
[1:40:56] you see he's defining his new creation
[1:41:01] and the scoring Lord this year
[1:41:05] why didn't fry herself with this new
[1:41:08] creation
[1:41:10] but she had a personal reputation I know
[1:41:15] this year in htibachi which they were
[1:41:17] not willing to lose
[1:41:23] without losing
[1:41:26] you cannot be a Christian Christian when
[1:41:29] you are losing nothing
[1:41:32] you don't lose the night club
[1:41:37] you don't lose the love for money
[1:41:41] you can as well go and trade in words
[1:41:48] are you together
[1:41:50] they can go and trade anywhere else
[1:42:04] you will not have salvation
[1:42:08] you retain your Fashions
[1:42:11] you'll not have salvation
[1:42:13] we must lose one do you know
[1:42:18] for Jesus to bring it yesterday he lost
[1:42:22] reputation
[1:42:29] amen Amina
[1:42:31] so but now he's standing in the midst of
[1:42:34] the church
[1:42:35] as he stands
[1:42:39] in this last age
[1:42:42] he calls himself the author of the
[1:42:45] creation of God
[1:42:47] this is
[1:42:50] another creation
[1:42:54] this has to do with the church
[1:42:58] this is a special designation of Christ
[1:43:03] he is the creator of the church
[1:43:06] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:43:10] brand
[1:43:13] as the spirit of God you came down and
[1:43:17] created in the Virgin Mary
[1:43:20] the sales form is body was born
[1:43:29] I want to repeat that he created the
[1:43:33] various cells in the womb of Mary for
[1:43:35] that body yet
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:43] it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[1:43:47] Simply give life to a human of you
[1:43:50] supplied by Mary teacher
[1:43:55] that would have been sinful mankind
