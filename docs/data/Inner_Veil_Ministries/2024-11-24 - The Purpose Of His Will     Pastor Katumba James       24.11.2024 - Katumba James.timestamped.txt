[34:11] Jesus amen you may be
[34:14] seated I want to preach about the
[34:16] purpose of his
[34:20] will the purpose of his
[34:23] will praise the name of our Lord you
[34:26] know God does not do
[34:30] anything without a
[34:33] purpose whether it looks
[34:36] bad or whether it looks
[34:38] good everything that God
[34:42] does has got a
[34:45] purpose and that
[34:48] purpose is done according to his
[34:53] will praise the name of our Lord even
[34:56] where we are born
[34:59] the parents that God made us come
[35:03] from God
[35:06] predetermined you know he decided that
[35:09] he should be
[35:11] like the time of your
[35:13] birth the place of
[35:16] your how you look like the community
[35:20] you're going to live with the friends
[35:22] you're going to
[35:24] interact the things you're going to like
[35:27] things you're going to
[35:29] detest you know you know the things
[35:31] you're going to
[35:33] dislike you know God
[35:36] purpose praise the name of our Lord and
[35:39] then he created
[35:41] People based on his
[35:44] purpose and you know what he
[35:47] wanted praise the name of our Lord and
[35:49] as brother Bram teaches
[35:51] us that God is God of a Varity
[35:58] praise the name of our Lord you know
[36:00] like
[36:01] here you can see that we don't have
[36:04] those many
[36:08] Hills but now when you go to a place
[36:10] like when you enter place
[36:13] like you know there are
[36:15] Hills when you go to a place around
[36:19] Masa when now you go further west
[36:27] there are so many
[36:29] Hills you know but then here you find
[36:32] that you have only
[36:34] one praise the name of the Lord and then
[36:37] now when you go to places
[36:41] like then you go that side
[36:45] kja then you you find lands which are
[36:51] plain you can see a
[36:54] far is a god of Varity
[36:58] praise the name of our Lord now as you
[37:00] can see now those mountains in K and
[37:03] other
[37:05] places and then maybe you go to a place
[37:08] like then you get a big
[37:11] mountain is God
[37:14] of you know then when you look at the
[37:17] trees then you get a big tree like a
[37:21] tree but then you can also get small
[37:25] trees short trees and different things
[37:29] and how the Lord has
[37:32] created is that in every
[37:35] place there are special species that
[37:38] survive in that
[37:41] place like now when you go to some of
[37:44] these
[37:45] places dry
[37:47] places you'll find that they also have
[37:50] fruits particular
[37:53] fruits which cannot survive in our
[37:55] places like we are here
[37:58] and then there you find that those
[37:59] people live by those
[38:02] fruits and then there are also animals
[38:04] in those
[38:05] places which can take
[38:08] days without drinking any water and they
[38:12] surviving so God has made things
[38:17] differently and then the Bible tells us
[38:20] that he has created
[38:23] us when we go to the Book of Revelation
[38:28] praise the name of the Lord in
[38:30] Revelations
[38:33] 4 and then verse
[38:36] 11 the Bible says though worthy oh
[38:41] Lord receive glory and
[38:45] honor and power for th has created all
[38:51] things and for thy
[38:55] pleasure they are
[38:59] and were
[39:04] created praise the name of our Lord so
[39:07] now the Bible says here that God has
[39:10] created all
[39:12] things for his
[39:15] pleasure praise the name of the Lord for
[39:18] his
[39:19] purpose for his will and then the Bible
[39:23] says that those things he has created
[39:28] they
[39:29] are and they
[39:33] were in other words whatever he has
[39:37] created he sustains
[39:41] it whatever he has created he enables it
[39:45] to
[39:47] continue according to his
[39:50] purpose praise the name of our Lord
[39:53] according to the purpose of God so it
[39:56] continues
[39:58] praise the name of our Lord you know
[40:00] like when you look at the people are on
[40:03] earth and then you look at the different
[40:07] countries praise the name of our you see
[40:10] people look
[40:12] different the way they are
[40:15] shaped the way their colors
[40:17] [Music]
[40:18] are even the food they
[40:21] eat the way they
[40:23] dress the way their hair is
[40:27] for you it may be
[40:31] offensive praise the name of you look at
[40:36] somebody you don't like the way they
[40:39] dress you don't like the way they look
[40:42] even what they eat I can't eat that but
[40:47] God has made
[40:48] them praise the name of the Lord when
[40:51] you look like in South America South
[40:54] America they are totally different from
[40:56] North America
[40:59] praise the name of our then you come to
[41:02] Africa totally different from
[41:05] Europe and then when you go to
[41:09] Asia you look at the
[41:11] Indians and then you look at the
[41:14] Koreans then you look at the
[41:17] Japanese then you look at the
[41:19] Chinese totally
[41:22] different praise the name of Lord
[41:24] totally
[41:26] different and now like you know they we
[41:28] used to get toys for
[41:31] children you know these
[41:35] dolls now when you look at it you say
[41:37] this is real
[41:40] toy but there are people who are like
[41:42] those
[41:45] toys exactly
[41:48] those you
[41:50] look I used to
[41:53] see but now for you see you don't see
[41:55] any person like that
[41:58] but then there are people who are like
[42:01] that and even the way they will eat the
[42:05] way they will walk you find that I can't
[42:09] survive
[42:10] here so now the Bible has told us God
[42:13] has made
[42:16] everything for his
[42:18] pleasure praise the name of our Lord
[42:21] like now when you go to
[42:23] Asia the way they
[42:25] dress they vary from country to
[42:30] Country you look at the
[42:32] Arabs the way they dress long things and
[42:37] then those from sa Arabia put on
[42:39] something on the head like
[42:41] this now when you go to
[42:44] Pakistan they are
[42:46] different they put on something like a
[42:50] dress and then something like a
[42:54] TR you look at the Iranians
[42:57] totally different even what they eat and
[43:01] some of their countries are Sunday
[43:07] countries but God has given them Grace
[43:10] To Survive
[43:12] there they have different
[43:16] temperaments either they can become too
[43:18] annoyed very
[43:19] [Music]
[43:23] fast but God is
[43:25] pleased that they like that and in that
[43:29] kind
[43:29] of so the Bible has told us he has
[43:33] created all
[43:35] things for his
[43:38] pleasure they
[43:40] are and they were it's God who maintains
[43:46] them praise the name of our Lord now in
[43:49] The Message Church
[43:51] H he says he is a sovereign God
[43:57] by his own
[43:59] counsel he purposed the plan of the
[44:02] Salvation of his own
[44:06] elect which he for knew the son died
[44:11] upon the
[44:12] cross to establish the means of
[44:16] Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully
[44:20] executes the will of the
[44:24] father he is working all
[44:28] things at this
[44:31] moment according to the purpose of his
[44:34] own
[44:36] will praise the name of our Lord so then
[44:39] brother Bram is saying that the holy
[44:43] spirit executes all the will of the
[44:48] father and is working in all
[44:52] things at this moment according to the
[44:56] purpose of his Own
[44:59] Way praise the name of our so now God is
[45:03] working upon
[45:04] us to fulfill his
[45:08] purpose that we can do what he has
[45:11] ordained for us to
[45:13] do now each and every one of us
[45:18] individually praise the name of our Lord
[45:20] you need to seek the will of
[45:23] God for your life
[45:27] has God so made
[45:29] me what is God's purpose for my
[45:33] life praise the name of our Lord you
[45:35] need to find out from
[45:37] God what is the purpose of God for my
[45:41] life you know we are not just live on
[45:46] us grow
[45:48] up get a good
[45:52] profession get a good job get a family
[45:57] raise the children after raising the
[46:00] children see your
[46:02] grandchildren say now I can depart in
[46:05] peace it's different from us
[46:08] now the rest of the people can think
[46:11] about
[46:12] that but that is
[46:15] temporary but yet there is an eternal
[46:18] purpose for every one of
[46:21] us why God has created
[46:24] us why God has made us
[46:28] praise the name of our Lord and so the
[46:30] Bible brother Bram tells
[46:33] us each and every one of
[46:35] us should seek the will of
[46:39] God in the message adoption
[46:43] chap he
[46:47] says having made known to us the mystery
[46:50] of his
[46:52] way the mysteries of his will
[46:57] and remember how we hung on
[47:00] that how many was here this
[47:04] morning then he says the mystery of his
[47:07] word now it is not just a little
[47:11] thing then it's a
[47:14] mystery God's
[47:17] will is a
[47:19] mystery and each
[47:21] man has to seek out the will of
[47:25] God for is or
[47:29] herself God is
[47:31] Mystery can every one of us you need to
[47:34] know Lord you've made
[47:37] me Lord you've made me to come in this
[47:41] generation what the purpose that have
[47:43] come in this
[47:45] generation praise the name of our Lord
[47:48] why have I come at this
[47:49] time why am I
[47:52] here there is a purpose of
[47:55] God is the name of our Lord like I can
[47:58] give a little
[48:00] example I have many of my
[48:03] friends Almost
[48:05] ages praise the name of our Lord and
[48:08] then some of them they ask
[48:10] you which class is your first
[48:13] born then you tell them
[48:16] Senor hey what
[48:18] happened then you ask them what about
[48:22] yours is almost finishing
[48:25] University start
[48:28] wondering praise the name of then you
[48:31] start wondering where the D
[48:35] is why did they take a long
[48:38] time but there's a purpose of
[48:42] God praise the name of our Lord and then
[48:45] I just got consolation
[48:49] sometime and then I just
[48:52] realized it was my
[48:54] time to raise children in this
[48:57] generation to prove to the world that
[49:01] they can be
[49:02] Christians praise the name of our Lord
[49:05] so we have to know what's the will of
[49:07] God for our
[49:10] lives look what the life of
[49:13] Han praise the name of Han had
[49:20] AWI and then the cowi was giving
[49:24] birth the children were growing up
[49:27] but was
[49:29] baren until the started you know putting
[49:32] pressure on
[49:34] her why don't you produce you you just
[49:38] here doing
[49:39] this and then Ka developed a
[49:44] burden and went to the
[49:47] temple and started crying to
[49:50] God Lord have upon Lord look at my
[49:54] reproach and then she prayed
[49:59] desperately until God had a
[50:02] prayer she conceived and gave birth now
[50:06] in her
[50:07] prayer she desperately
[50:10] prayed and promised
[50:13] God I am going to give this child back
[50:17] to
[50:19] you and I believe that's what God was
[50:21] looking from her all that
[50:24] time because if she was giving like the
[50:27] other
[50:28] one she don't mind giving the child to
[50:31] God but now God made sure that she's in
[50:35] a
[50:37] fix she can't do
[50:40] anything until she said I'm giving you
[50:43] this
[50:44] child and now when Samuel was
[50:48] win you know you know at stop bre
[50:51] feeding she brought Samuel to the
[50:55] temple and now God had already ordained
[51:00] Samuel to be a
[51:03] prophet to be a judge over
[51:06] Israel but how could that
[51:09] be God had to allow
[51:13] strations until Han gets into the mind
[51:16] of
[51:18] God that the child I'm going to give
[51:21] birth
[51:22] to is not my child but he the child of
[51:25] God
[51:27] praise the name of our Lord and also God
[51:29] wants us to reach that
[51:32] condition that now this I'm not on my
[51:37] own praise the name of our Lord and each
[51:40] of us should come to that
[51:42] realization that I'm not living my own
[51:45] life I'm not seeking my own desire but
[51:49] I'm seeking the will of
[51:52] God I'm seeking the purpose of
[51:55] God praise name of our Lord and then you
[51:58] can see how the Lord can come and handle
[52:01] things so each and every one of us has
[52:04] to seek the will of
[52:07] God for our lives praise the name of our
[52:10] Lord then say how did we how do we find
[52:14] out the will of God for our
[52:18] lives Paul it was known to
[52:22] him he said did not Comer with any man
[52:28] no fresh and
[52:29] blood he went to no school no Seminary
[52:34] he had nothing to do with
[52:36] it he received it it was revealed to
[52:41] him by Jesus Christ who met him on the
[52:45] road to
[52:47] Damascus like a pillar of fire and
[52:50] called him and he went to
[52:54] Arabia and there he dwelt three
[52:58] years don't you imagine that was some
[53:02] time years was down there in
[53:06] Arabia he rented his little building
[53:10] somewhere walking up and down the
[53:13] floor with all the old
[53:17] Scrolls praise the name of our Lord now
[53:20] we are seeing how we can find God's
[53:24] purpose for our life
[53:28] each and every one of us take time and
[53:31] wait on the
[53:32] Lord take time and seek God and then you
[53:36] find out from
[53:38] God Lord why have you made me this why
[53:42] have you put me in this
[53:44] place praise the name of our Lord why
[53:47] have you put me in this kind of
[53:49] area why am I doing this kind of
[53:53] job because there is a purpose of God
[53:55] for that
[53:57] so even Paul S the purpose of God
[54:00] for by going back to read the
[54:04] scriptures how that God at the beginning
[54:09] predestinated us unto eternal
[54:13] life how that he would send
[54:16] Jesus that through this
[54:19] sacrifice all have a right to the Tree
[54:22] of
[54:24] Life does he for you he called does he
[54:29] called he has already
[54:32] Justified does he justified he has
[54:35] already
[54:37] glorified God since the beginning of the
[54:41] world predestinated us to the adoption
[54:44] of
[54:46] sons now the whole
[54:49] creation
[54:52] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[54:54] of the sons of God
[54:58] I would imagine Paul had a wonderful
[55:02] time I would like to have been there
[55:05] with
[55:06] him don't you praise the name of Lord so
[55:10] he went and S
[55:13] God and you know Paul was at a
[55:19] crossroad you know the way he was
[55:22] raised a Pharisee somebody who knew the
[55:26] Lord
[55:27] somebody was a
[55:29] scholar and then he persecuted the
[55:31] church and then the grace of
[55:34] God Christ appeared to him praise the
[55:38] name of the Lord when he was going to
[55:41] Damascus and then he was wondering what
[55:43] is this
[55:44] Lord for three days he was praying and
[55:48] fasting praise the name of then after
[55:51] his
[55:52] conversion he went to Arabia for 3 years
[55:56] to really go back and
[55:59] read the things he had been taught in
[56:03] school get the true
[56:06] understanding of what God wants to speak

[1:01:19] people are going to lecture to you but
[1:01:22] all this God has already done it
[1:01:27] praise the name of our Lord because
[1:01:28] there is a purpose
[1:01:31] somewhere and so you get there you all
[1:01:36] strangers and sometimes like maybe you

[1:02:10] lean's
[1:02:13] place it wasn't at
[1:02:15] all praise the name of our Lord the
[1:02:18] mother just told

[1:02:54] no how about if
[1:02:57] discovered then Rebecca told him it will
[1:03:01] be upon me only obey me now Rebecca had
[1:03:06] the mind of
[1:03:09] God that the
[1:03:12] younger shall rule the
[1:03:15] Elder the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:03:19] young is Isaac was a
[1:03:24] prophet but God didn't reveal that to
[1:03:27] him at that
[1:03:28] time but he revealed to
[1:03:32] Rebecca and you know
[1:03:35] Isaac lived more years than
[1:03:39] Abraham praise the name of our Lord but
[1:03:42] most of his
[1:03:43] life he was
[1:03:47] blind praise the name
[1:03:49] of and God had to make sure that he's
[1:03:54] blind and he does see any
[1:03:57] vision and He blesses
[1:04:00] Jacob yet he wanted to bless
[1:04:03] Isaac so it was the purpose of
[1:04:07] God to see that things would be like
[1:04:10] that there's some things that come to
[1:04:13] our
[1:04:14] lives and you don't know why it is

[1:04:45] late and then the father
[1:04:49] trembled he

[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:26] and then Jesus answers them and he said
[1:32:29] unto them it's not for you to know the
[1:32:32] times or the
[1:32:37] seasons which the father has put in his
[1:32:40] own
[1:32:43] power so there are things that God
[1:32:46] reserves to
[1:32:48] himself praise the name of our Lord and
[1:32:51] then he reveals it at a particular time
[1:32:55] he makes it known at a particular
[1:32:58] time and he holds some
[1:33:01] things that many times you don't know
[1:33:03] what's going to happen even
[1:33:07] today but then the thing we should we
[1:33:10] should have confidence
[1:33:12] in is that I have committed all my ways
[1:33:15] to
[1:33:16] God prise the name of they should give
[1:33:19] us
[1:33:20] contentment Lord I've done all that you
[1:33:23] wanted
[1:33:26] praise the name of
[1:33:29] Joseph when the father sent him to take
[1:33:32] food for his
[1:33:34] Brethren he didn't
[1:33:36] know that he's seeing the
[1:33:39] father for the last
[1:33:43] time until when he's almost going to
[1:33:45] die he didn't
[1:33:47] know for him he went he sees he goes to
[1:33:51] a place where his Brethren were raising
[1:33:53] from
[1:33:55] he doesn't find them then he asked the
[1:33:58] people of the
[1:33:59] L where are the
[1:34:01] Hebrews then they told him we heard them
[1:34:05] speak they go to the other place because
[1:34:08] there was not enough pasture
[1:34:10] over then he follows and now when the
[1:34:13] brethen saw him
[1:34:15] far look at the dream come let us what
[1:34:19] will come of his dream let us kill him
[1:34:24] praise the name of Joseph didn't know
[1:34:26] what was going
[1:34:28] on he didn't know that that same
[1:34:31] day he's being taken into
[1:34:34] slaver he didn't know praise the name of
[1:34:37] our but when his Breen wanted to kill
[1:34:41] him Reuben stood there to see that no
[1:34:44] harm is
[1:34:46] done even when Reuben went
[1:34:49] away Judas stood there let us not shed
[1:34:53] the blood of
[1:34:55] but let us tell him when they saw the
[1:34:58] isites
[1:35:00] coming so God had ordained
[1:35:04] everything that there was no pasture
[1:35:07] here this should go to a
[1:35:10] place where the root was for the isite
[1:35:13] to go to
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:16] Egypt praise the name of and then he
[1:35:19] made sure that there was a hole
[1:35:22] there and the jealous and the
[1:35:26] envy and then God made sure that he
[1:35:30] showed Joseph the
[1:35:33] dreams of what is going to happen and
[1:35:36] then the Brethren
[1:35:38] hated the same thing with our Lord Jesus
[1:35:41] Christ if the Jews didn't hate
[1:35:44] him he wouldn't have been
[1:35:48] crucified praise the name of our Lord
[1:35:50] but God allowed them to hate Jesus
[1:35:54] to crucify him that salvation can come
[1:35:57] to
[1:35:58] us praise the name of our Lord so the
[1:36:01] same thing with
[1:36:02] Joseph he didn't know and then they just
[1:36:06] take him a
[1:36:08] slave and when they take him a slave he
[1:36:12] is bought by
[1:36:14] pilate pus rather by
[1:36:18] pitifer God
[1:36:21] orain that the purpose of God can be
[1:36:25] fulfilled in the life of
[1:36:27] Joseph praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:30] Joseph is there prosperous
[1:36:35] person and then in
[1:36:37] Egypt praise the name of they were
[1:36:40] speaking in
[1:36:42] tongues they were worshiping
[1:36:44] idols and the wife of porer was just
[1:36:47] like strip
[1:36:55] just a
[1:36:59] scrip and then sometimes you go to
[1:37:01] people's
[1:37:03] homes they just dress the way they
[1:37:08] want praise the name of they just dress
[1:37:12] the way they
[1:37:14] want you think po stripped from where
[1:37:17] from the street from home
[1:37:23] at home not in her
[1:37:26] bedroom maybe in the sitting room or in
[1:37:29] the
[1:37:30] kitchen or the
[1:37:32] compound like when you go to
[1:37:35] Villages you get those elderly
[1:37:39] women up is
[1:37:42] be and they sited
[1:37:47] there and then you go to believer's
[1:37:50] home they also want to do the same
[1:37:56] he's
[1:37:57] wife you shouldn't be like's
[1:38:01] wife praise the name
[1:38:03] of so Joseph at the end of the day is
[1:38:06] put in
[1:38:09] prison but God ordained
[1:38:14] everything that Joseph being a prisoner
[1:38:17] from P's
[1:38:20] house he was put in Max
[1:38:26] prison you know those big people in
[1:38:29] government those Chief
[1:38:31] criminals they don't put them in the
[1:38:34] same Chambers with the chicken thieves
[1:38:36] and things like
[1:38:39] that there's a special place where they
[1:38:41] put
[1:38:43] them and even Joseph was put in that
[1:38:45] special
[1:38:47] place until when the buler and the
[1:38:51] baker you know those work for for for
[1:38:57] pilot you know for
[1:39:00] Fara they also brought in the same
[1:39:02] chamber where
[1:39:05] Joseph see the plan of
[1:39:08] God then they had
[1:39:10] dreams and then God manifested Joseph's
[1:39:15] gift praise the name of one was killed
[1:39:20] one was
[1:39:21] restored after two solid
[1:39:25] God brings a dream to
[1:39:28] pharaoh and nobody would interpret
[1:39:33] it and now brother Bram tells us that
[1:39:38] God can not give a dream which is
[1:39:44] mysterious unless there is a prophet
[1:39:49] interpret he will give you an open dream
[1:39:54] like
[1:39:56] Joseph in the New
[1:39:58] Testament in MTH chapter 1 when he was
[1:40:01] thinking of putting Mary
[1:40:04] away the angel came to him in a
[1:40:07] dream and frankly told him don't put
[1:40:11] away Mary
[1:40:13] wife what she has conceived is of the
[1:40:15] Holy
[1:40:17] Spirit when the three wise
[1:40:20] men had seen Herod
[1:40:24] the god revealed to them in a
[1:40:27] dream don't go back to
[1:40:29] Herod don't use the same route you
[1:40:32] use use another route Open
[1:40:36] Dreams Joseph in the night
[1:40:39] again God told him take the child to
[1:40:43] Egypt because there was no Prophet to
[1:40:45] interpret
[1:40:46] that praise the name of our Lord so now
[1:40:50] you don't start getting a dream of
[1:40:52] symbols
[1:40:55] and then now you start buying these
[1:40:57] books of
[1:41:03] dreams you know when you dream when
[1:41:07] you you're going to get
[1:41:11] mbling until we have dream
[1:41:17] church but you can't stand on
[1:41:20] dreams you can't build your salvation on
[1:41:24] dreams you build your confidence on the
[1:41:27] word of
[1:41:29] God praise the name of so you see God
[1:41:33] has a purpose in
[1:41:36] everything how would the gift of Joseph
[1:41:38] be
[1:41:41] known if those prisoners from P's
[1:41:45] Pharaoh's house did not be in the same
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:50] prison praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:41:53] need to allow
[1:41:56] God praise the name of our Lord to
[1:41:58] direct us he knows what he is
[1:42:03] doing praise the name of our Lord when
[1:42:05] you see things and are kind of like you
[1:42:08] can't
[1:42:10] understand wait on the Lord and say Lord
[1:42:13] here I
[1:42:14] am I don't know what I'm going through
[1:42:18] come and direct me come and guide me
[1:42:22] praise the name of
[1:42:23] come and give me
[1:42:25] strength praise the name of our Lord and
[1:42:27] then you'll see how the Lord will always
[1:42:30] come
[1:42:31] down to help you in thetion you are
[1:42:35] in now in the Satan Church
[1:42:40] age God's will for us is
[1:42:46] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:42:49] patience
[1:42:53] waiting on
[1:42:55] God and waiting for
[1:42:58] God praise the name of the Lord he says
[1:43:01] you wait on
[1:43:04] God lord what should I
[1:43:07] do you get it Lord which way should I
[1:43:12] take you're waiting on God now that
[1:43:16] you're asking him no I don't know the
[1:43:19] direction to
[1:43:20] go like maybe you're in ginger
[1:43:24] from
[1:43:25] here he says go
[1:43:28] TOA then we have waited on him he has
[1:43:31] told you to go
[1:43:33] to but you also need to wait for
[1:43:39] him to direct you which way to
[1:43:44] take praise the name of you wait on
[1:43:48] God which way you wait for God
[1:43:54] guide me be ahead of me praise the name
[1:43:58] of our Lord then he says this is the
[1:44:01] process of character
[1:44:04] development in other words you are there
[1:44:08] you are
[1:44:09] waiting like now when David was in a
[1:44:14] fix there are people you know I think
[1:44:17] the were the
[1:44:19] Philistines they had come and done
[1:44:21] damage
[1:44:23] killed some people taking even others to
[1:44:27] captivity now
[1:44:29] David he wouldn't do anything that even
[1:44:33] taken some of his
[1:44:35] wives so David what he did he waited on
[1:44:39] the Lord he called for the
[1:44:43] effort know
[1:44:48] like and then inquired of the
[1:44:51] lord lord
[1:44:54] what should I
[1:44:55] do can I pursue
[1:44:58] them will I find them will I restore
[1:45:02] these people and then the Lord told him
[1:45:06] pursue them but they didn't know where
[1:45:09] they were and so they kept on
[1:45:12] going until they got somebody
[1:45:15] there who was like kind of like you know
[1:45:18] of you know
[1:45:20] stranded then they asked him
[1:45:23] can you tell us where these people
[1:45:26] are then he told him if you don't kill
[1:45:29] me I take you where they are okay but it
[1:45:34] was all the direction of
[1:45:37] God and waiting on
[1:45:40] God until that young man took them where
[1:45:43] they
[1:45:45] were praise the name of our now
[1:45:48] Christian
[1:45:49] Life is entirely depending on God
[1:45:56] praise the name don't wake up one
[1:46:04] day you get in trouble you get messed
[1:46:08] up every stage in
[1:46:11] life seek that you depend on the
[1:46:14] Lord seek that you wait on the
[1:46:18] Lord Lord here I am what will you have
[1:46:22] me to do
[1:46:24] praise the name of our Lord Lord here I
[1:46:26] am what will you have me to do brother
[1:46:30] Bram he would see a
[1:46:32] vision of somebody getting
[1:46:36] healed God has showed him he would wait
[1:46:39] on
[1:46:40] God then God would show him a
[1:46:43] vision and now when God shows him a
[1:46:46] vision in that
[1:46:48] Vision there are particular aspects
[1:46:54] maybe the patient is on the
[1:46:58] bed and maybe another person is dressed
[1:47:01] in this
[1:47:03] color and is SE in this
[1:47:06] chair and then maybe this cup is
[1:47:09] here so he would watch those
[1:47:13] details so he would know that God is
[1:47:16] going to heal this
[1:47:18] person then he comes and he waits for
[1:47:22] God's time
[1:47:26] why don't you pray for
[1:47:27] him said wait so he sits there waiting
[1:47:33] until everything plays out as it was in
[1:47:35] the
[1:47:38] vision Waiting for
[1:47:40] God at the right
[1:47:42] time Jesus told them it's not for
[1:47:47] you to know the times and the
[1:47:50] seasons because God will Reve
[1:47:53] it when that time
[1:47:56] comes praise the name of our Lord how
[1:47:59] he's going to do it I don't know but
[1:48:02] he's going to do it praise the name of
[1:48:05] that should give us
[1:48:07] confidence in the midst of the
[1:48:09] challenges we are going
[1:48:11] through in the midst of the STS you're
[1:48:13] going through it should give you
[1:48:17] confidence praise the name of our Lord
[1:48:19] like
[1:48:20] Paul he says
[1:48:23] I know whom I have
[1:48:26] believed praise the name of and have
[1:48:28] committed to
[1:48:30] him how about us have we committed
[1:48:34] everything to
[1:48:35] him you've committed your family you
[1:48:38] committed your life to him youve
[1:48:40] committed your place of work to you
[1:48:43] committed everything about you to him
[1:48:46] and so you are not in any shock if
[1:48:48] anything
[1:48:49] happens you say Lord this is destraction
[1:48:53] Lord guide me which direction I
[1:48:56] should praise the name of our Lord then
[1:48:59] brother Brown continues to say how high
[1:49:02] God has commanded this sense of the Dark
[1:49:08] Ages patient as lamps led to the
[1:49:15] slaughter
[1:49:17] lovingly
[1:49:19] Faithfully they served God that is is
[1:49:22] all they wanted out of
[1:49:26] life just service to their
[1:49:30] God how great was their
[1:49:34] reward praise the name of our how we
[1:49:36] need to depend upon
[1:49:39] God in everything that we do praise the
[1:49:42] name of our Lord let us go to Hebrews
[1:49:45] chapter
[1:49:48] 12 and then verse one
[1:49:52] Bible says wherefor seeing we are all
[1:49:55] encompassed about with so great a cloud
[1:49:58] of witnesses let us lay aside every
[1:50:01] weight and the sin which does easily
[1:50:03] beset us and let us run with patience
[1:50:07] the rest that is set before us
[1:50:30] the name of Lord he said see we have a
[1:50:33] great cloud of
[1:50:38] witness Hebrews chapter
[1:50:41] 11 you know it goes talks about every
[1:50:46] circumstance people went through
[1:50:47] whatever we are going
[1:50:50] through and then the Lord will show how
[1:50:52] they were
[1:50:55] overcoming praise the name of our Lord
[1:50:57] so he says there are a great cloud of
[1:51:00] witness so then the Bible tells us let
[1:51:04] us lay aside every
[1:51:10] weight praise the name of our there are
[1:51:12] some weights you are carrying and they
[1:51:14] taking you
[1:51:17] nowhere them
[1:51:19] aside praise the name of our Lord you
[1:51:22] know there are some burdens we keep on
[1:51:24] putting on our
[1:51:28] backs praise the name of the Lord you
[1:51:30] want to be in this kind of thing you
[1:51:33] want to be in the other kind of thing
[1:51:35] you want to be in the other kind of
[1:51:37] there are some of those we which are not
[1:51:39] necessary to
[1:51:42] come praise the name of the Lord so you
[1:51:45] put them
[1:51:48] aside blessed be the name of our
[1:51:50] Lord and now one thing for
[1:51:55] example is our
[1:51:58] introductions you get an
[1:52:01] introduction and then the music that
[1:52:04] they are putting
[1:52:08] there people become un
[1:52:13] Christians and then you
[1:52:16] get maybe the bride they ask which
[1:52:20] song then it talks of the name
[1:52:24] then she starts
[1:52:26] Ming now go down
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:38] slowly
[1:52:41] wait you want say my function has to be
[1:52:44] like
[1:52:47] this but see the world which has cting
[1:52:52] see the reproach being brought the name
[1:52:54] of
[1:52:57] Christ praise the name of and then when
[1:53:02] girls come
[1:53:06] toet they tellys that attack attack then
[1:53:11] you start wondering where did the C is
[1:53:14] this culture
[1:53:19] or when the when the boys come
[1:53:24] the the in-laws they call them
[1:53:28] inlaws they tell the girls of
[1:53:33] women and then they give them
[1:53:38] belts then they come and
[1:53:41] tie told you start dancing with
[1:53:45] you even cure that's not
[1:53:49] cure but we have allowed it
[1:53:53] we have put it back on our
[1:53:56] back and sometimes if if you go in some
[1:53:59] of those
[1:54:01] places maybe you have
[1:54:03] escorted then you also go and
[1:54:10] attack and then you'll
[1:54:13] find this man here dancing with a
[1:54:15] strange
[1:54:18] woman has never with the wife
[1:54:23] that's
[1:54:24] never but you know the spirit which is
[1:54:30] there it's like the
[1:54:34] spirit which took on the children of
[1:54:36] Israel when the moabites were dancing
[1:54:38] with
[1:54:40] them the Feast
[1:54:45] of because these women were for them
[1:54:48] they had no

[1:54:52] they in seductive
[1:54:55] way you know just to
[1:55:00] entice now for you are there then the
[1:55:03] spirit jumps on
[1:55:05] you
[1:55:07] destruction their weights we are
[1:55:11] carrying weights we are
[1:55:16] carry oh my function should be
[1:55:20] good that brother speak then you get the
[1:55:23] other one who promotes those
[1:55:30] of and Christ is not seen at home
[1:55:35] there and this has happened in many
[1:55:37] Believers
[1:55:40] homes and sometimes the family of the
[1:55:44] girl is a
[1:55:46] Believer the family of the boy is a
[1:55:49] Believer they have authority
[1:55:52] what is happening in
[1:55:54] the but then they are
[1:55:57] mom they also enjoying the spirit has
[1:56:00] got a hold
[1:56:03] of you know you see the days we're
[1:56:06] living and sometimes you even get
[1:56:11] offended you get offended in the
[1:56:15] things the name of and me personally I
[1:56:18] don't
[1:56:20] record praise the name of why would I
[1:56:23] record something which is
[1:56:25] offensive I will not record
[1:56:28] that but these are the things we have
[1:56:30] allowed the world to creep
[1:56:33] in we are carrying a weight because you
[1:56:36] want to please
[1:56:38] somebody but the Bible says praise the
[1:56:42] name of the Lord let us go to Second
[1:56:44] Timothy 2
[1:56:47] vers praise the name of the Lord second
[1:56:50] Timothy 2 verse1
[1:56:56] though therefore my son be strong in the
[1:56:58] grace that is in Christ
[1:57:04] Jesus and the things that you have heard
[1:57:07] of me among many witnesses the same
[1:57:09] commit though to Faithful Men Who Shall
[1:57:12] be able to teach others also
[1:57:24] though therefore endure hardness as a
[1:57:27] good soldier of Jesus
[1:57:32] Christ no man that Warth entangles
[1:57:37] himself with the Affairs of this life
[1:57:40] that he may please him who has chosen
[1:57:42] him to be a soldier
[1:58:08] and if a man also strive for masteries
[1:58:12] yet he is not crowned except he strive
[1:58:15] lawfully
[1:58:23] praise the name of our Lord he says You
[1:58:26] must please the one who has called
[1:58:30] you when you are in
[1:58:34] Waring don't entangle
[1:58:37] yourself with the Affairs of this life
[1:58:41] how the world does this also do the same
[1:58:46] there will be no
[1:58:47] difference but then here the Bible says
[1:58:50] we have a rest we
[1:58:54] running it's a race that is set before
[1:58:57] us and then the Bible says we run with
[1:59:02] patience praise the name of our Lord
[1:59:05] rest there are challenges along the
[1:59:09] way and Christ expects
[1:59:12] us to run in the right
[1:59:16] way to strive
[1:59:20] lawfully you know the way he has
[1:59:23] ordained it to
[1:59:25] be praise the name of our Lord why we
[1:59:29] are
[1:59:30] pressing to the mark of the High Calling
[1:59:33] of
[1:59:35] Christ and our High
[1:59:37] Calling is to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:59:40] Christ praise the name of our Lord how
[1:59:43] can you be the bride of
[1:59:45] Christ and you're messing yourself with
[1:59:47] the things of the
[1:59:50] world how
[1:59:52] praise the name of our Lord you are a
[1:59:54] young a young
[1:59:57] woman your fi has promised you to come
[2:00:00] and pick you for
[2:00:02] marriage and then you are busy talking
[2:00:04] with different
[2:00:09] men you look good you're messing with
[2:00:13] the
[2:00:14] world mixing with
[2:00:16] this with
[2:00:19] this you don't do that praise the name
[2:00:22] of our Lord so now the Bible tells us in
[2:00:25] second Timothy
[2:00:28] 2 verse
[2:00:30] 19 he says neveress the foundation of
[2:00:34] God stand sure having this seal the Lord
[2:00:38] knows them that are his and let everyone
[2:00:42] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[2:00:45] from
[2:01:07] says name the name of the
[2:01:09] Lord depart from
[2:01:12] iniquity praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:15] depart from it and don't be used to
[2:01:18] doing evil
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:24] don't do that praise the name of our
[2:01:27] Lord if you do it the Lord have

[2:01:34] this help me to overcome my
[2:01:37] weaknesses praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:40] so the Bible says we shouldn't entangle
[2:01:44] ourselves with the Affairs of
[2:01:48] this let us depart from iniquity
[2:01:53] Others May do it and they have no
[2:01:57] conviction Others May do it and well
[2:02:00] life goes on
[2:02:02] normally but for us praise the name of
[2:02:06] we have a

[2:11:31] here Revelation
[2:11:33] 3 he says God placed the first
[2:11:38] man Adam and
[2:11:41] Eve right here on free moral
[2:11:46] ages he places you the same place
[2:11:52] and the only way that you can get this
[2:11:55] fixed in

[2:13:12] weight Here Am have control over my
[2:13:16] life I am
[2:13:18] nothing look at Paul having heard the
[2:13:21] instructions from the high
[2:13:24] priest when Christ met him on the
[2:13:27] way he changed the
[2:13:30] order so Paul no longer went to the
[2:13:34] Pharisees but he had high
[2:13:37] command he had a high
[2:13:40] calling we have also got a high
[2:13:43] calling to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:13:46] and there are so many things that
[2:13:49] happen that can spot
[2:13:52] you that can wrinkle you that can bring

[2:14:02] purpose of God is clear in your
[2:14:04] life so you are getting rid of
[2:14:08] self and allowing God's

[2:14:21] to let God's will
[2:14:25] coming for this is the only channel that
[2:14:28] leads to the
[2:14:31] heart then he says but you have to do
[2:14:34] God's
[2:14:36] way to let the Holy Spirit come in here
[2:14:40] to bring
[2:14:41] forth praise the name of you subscribe
[2:14:44] to the word of
[2:14:46] God you surrender to the word of God

[2:15:15] not going to be left
[2:15:17] behind praise the name of our like
[2:15:20] Simeon
[2:15:21] the Bible says he was a just and devote
[2:15:26] man and he was
[2:15:28] waiting for the consolation of
[2:15:31] Israel he was waiting for the
[2:15:34] Messiah in the Book of Luke Chapter
[2:15:39] 2 praise the name of our Lord Luke chap
[2:15:44] 2 and then we read in verse
[2:15:49] 25 and behold there was a man in
[2:15:52] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[2:15:55] same man was just and devot waiting for
[2:15:59] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[2:16:01] Ghost was upon
[2:16:15] him just and
[2:16:18] devot in other words like filled with
[2:16:20] the Holy SP
[2:16:23] living according to the word of
[2:16:26] God the Holy Ghost was
[2:16:28] upon he was
[2:16:30] waiting we are waiting for the
[2:16:33] rapture we are waiting for the change of
[2:16:35] our
[2:16:36] bodies so every day you are looking for
[2:16:39] the
[2:16:40] Lord Lord if you are coming
[2:16:42] today let me be found let me be found
[2:16:47] worthy praise the name of Lord not
[2:16:50] giving room to things which are

[2:16:57] right you don't give that wrong
[2:17:01] supposing he comes
[2:17:02] today praise the name of our Lord so he
[2:17:05] was
[2:17:06] waiting and the Bible says the Holy
[2:17:09] Ghost was upon him and then the Holy
[2:17:12] Spirit revealed to him that he should
[2:17:16] not
[2:17:17] die before he sees the Lord is Christ
[2:17:23] and we have got the message that
[2:17:26] prepares us for the
[2:17:27] rapture we got the message that makes us
[2:17:31] the Bride of Jesus
[2:17:33] Christ we need to take the message

[2:17:52] name of our so the Bible says the Holy
[2:17:55] Ghost was
[2:17:56] upon and the Holy Ghost revealed to
[2:17:59] sim that you are not going to die until
[2:18:03] you see the Lord is Christ now it is so
[2:18:07] interesting that the same Holy Spirit
[2:18:11] which had revealed to
[2:18:13] Simeon when Jesus was brought into the
[2:18:16] temple the Holy Ghost took Simeon
[2:18:21] Jesus was there were hundreds of babies
[2:18:24] in the
[2:18:25] temple but the Holy Ghost was not
[2:18:32] gambling right on spot and that's the
[2:18:36] same thing for our
[2:18:38] rupture if we have the message of the
[2:18:42] hour we are ready we are filled with the
[2:18:45] Holy Spirit whether the Rapture comes

[2:19:24] of our Lord we are now
