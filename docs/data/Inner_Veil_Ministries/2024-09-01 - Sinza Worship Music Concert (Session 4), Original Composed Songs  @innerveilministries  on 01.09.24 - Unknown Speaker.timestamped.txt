[1:23:28] bring
[1:23:33] bring bring down wondering ones to
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:41] J praise the name of our
[1:23:44] Lord when you got the
[1:23:47] denominations they always get the little
[1:23:49] children like these
[1:23:51] ones and then they pour water on their
[1:23:55] foreheads saying that they baptizing
[1:23:58] them but that is wrong there is no basis
[1:24:02] in the
[1:24:04] Bible where they ever baptized a little
[1:24:08] child it is not written because the
[1:24:11] Bible says one has to First
[1:24:16] believe then
[1:24:18] confess then he
[1:24:20] baptized but this little baby doesn't
[1:24:24] understand understand
[1:24:26] anything and you can't even preach the
[1:24:28] gospel to the
[1:24:30] baby so it is wrong baptism which they
[1:24:33] do in the
[1:24:34] denominations so when the little
[1:24:36] children are brought to
[1:24:38] Christ in Matthew chapter
[1:24:41] 19 and then verse
[1:24:43] 13 the Bible says then we are brought
[1:24:47] unto him little
[1:24:50] children that he' put his hands on them
[1:24:55] and pray and the disciples rebuked
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:24:59] them but Jesus
[1:25:02] said suffer the little
[1:25:05] children for them not to come unto
[1:25:09] me for such is the kingdom of
[1:25:13] God and he laid his hands on
[1:25:16] them and
[1:25:18] departed praise the name of our Lord and
[1:25:21] that's what we want to
[1:25:22] do praise the name of
[1:25:27] [Music]

[1:35:12] one okay we can start from Exodus
[1:35:14] chapter
[1:35:17] 14 and then
[1:35:21] verse verse 26
[1:35:26] the Bible says and the Lord said unto
[1:35:29] Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea
[1:35:33] that the waters May Come Again upon the
[1:35:36] Egyptians upon their chariots and upon
[1:35:39] their h
[1:36:01] and Moses stretched forth his hand over
[1:36:04] the sea and the Sea returned to his
[1:36:07] strength when the morning appeared and
[1:36:10] the Egyptians fled against it and the
[1:36:12] Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
[1:36:15] midst of the sea
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:37] and the waters returned and covered the
[1:36:40] Chariots and the horsemen and all the
[1:36:43] host of pharaoh that came into the sea
[1:36:45] after them they remained not so much as
[1:36:49] one of them
[1:37:10] praise the name of the Lord you know the
[1:37:14] Egyptians had had the children of Israel
[1:37:16] for more than 400
[1:37:20] years and now at the time of redemption
[1:37:23] of the children of
[1:37:25] Israel that's when the Egyptians
[1:37:29] started to punish them praise the name
[1:37:32] of our Lord and there are also some
[1:37:34] strations in our
[1:37:36] lives that can hold you some
[1:37:40] habits that can bind you you've tried to
[1:37:44] get rid of that

[1:37:56] Happ but the thing you need to do is
[1:37:59] don't give up following the Lord praise
[1:38:03] the name of our Lord these
[1:38:06] Egyptians they didn't want to let go of
[1:38:08] the children of Isel even when they had
[1:38:11] lost their first borns in their
[1:38:14] houses they still got stuck we need to
[1:38:16] bring them
[1:38:17] back and you know there are some
[1:38:19] circumstances in life where the devil
[1:38:22] wants to keep you his
[1:38:26] slave where the devil wants you to be
[1:38:28] his own

[1:38:41] name of our Lord even if the STS are
[1:38:43] hard keep on pressing forward and that's

[1:38:49] had they had Moses leading them with the
[1:38:53] word of God let us keep on going let us
[1:38:56] keep on going it didn't matter what
[1:38:58] enemy was
[1:38:59] doing to follow them praise the name of
[1:39:03] our Lord but it reached a time that the

[1:39:11] life that whatever enemies in your life
[1:39:15] has to be cut off praise the name of our
[1:39:18] Lord so you just keep on moving
[1:39:21] forward without giving up

[1:39:26] give up praise the name of our Lord but
[1:39:30] keep on holding strong to the word of
[1:39:34] God so it reached a time that the
[1:39:37] children of the
[1:39:39] Egyptians had to be
[1:39:42] destroyed praise the name of our Lord
[1:39:44] and when the Egyptians were
[1:39:47] destroyed praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:49] there was joy in the children of Israel
[1:39:54] they sng a new

[1:40:08] free
[1:40:10] physically going to the promised land
[1:40:13] praise the name of our Lord they were
[1:40:18] losen then in
[1:40:21] Exodus let us continue vers 29 but the
[1:40:25] children of Israel walked on the dry
[1:40:26] land in the midst of the Sea and the
[1:40:28] waters were a wall unto them on the
[1:40:31] right hand and on the
[1:40:41] left thus the Lord saved Israel that day
[1:40:45] out of the hand of the Egyptians and
[1:40:48] Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the
[1:40:51] seashore
[1:41:01] praise the name of our Lord they just
[1:41:03] saw these enemies are now
[1:41:07] dead praise the name of our Lord where

[1:41:46] for something and you have taken too
[1:41:49] long to get that thing come back now
[1:41:52] when it comes then the inspiration
[1:41:55] strikes
[1:41:56] you and then you sing a new
[1:41:59] song Praise the name of you talk about
[1:42:03] people have been looking for Life
[1:42:09] Partners praise the name of the Lord and
[1:42:12] then now when they see the thing is now
[1:42:16] over praise the name of our Lord I'm
[1:42:19] just remembering brother
[1:42:21] Dan in
[1:42:24] praise the name of our Lord just a new
[1:42:28] song then
[1:42:30] Joshua the introduction
[1:42:32] in praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:42:35] and then they get a new song it's such
[1:42:38] an
[1:42:40] excitement and some want to reveal that
[1:42:43] song on that
[1:42:45] day praise the name of our Lord like the
[1:42:48] song the Bible says what a happy day
[1:42:52] when
[1:42:53] Jesus saved my
[1:42:55] soul praise the name of our Lord it was
[1:42:58] a happy
[1:43:00] day what a glorious day when I knew
[1:43:04] Christ what a great day when I knew who
[1:43:08] I
[1:43:09] am praise the name of our Lord then you
[1:43:12] sing a new
[1:43:13] song a song to praise the lord of the
[1:43:17] things that he has done of the great
[1:43:19] things he has worked in your life praise
[1:43:22] the name of Lord and then the Bible says
[1:43:25] and Israel saw the great work which the
[1:43:27] Lord did upon the
[1:43:31] Egyptians verse
[1:43:38] 31 and the people feared the
[1:43:41] Lord and believed the Lord and his
[1:43:44] servant
[1:43:47] Moses then sang Moses and the children
[1:43:51] of Israel this song and to the
[1:43:58] Lord and
[1:44:00] spoke saying I will sing unto the
[1:44:04] Lord he has triumphed
[1:44:10] gloriously the horse and his Riders
[1:44:13] thrown into the
[1:44:17] sea praise the name of the Lord so now
[1:44:20] you see that the experience that they
[1:44:21] went through
[1:44:24] became a
[1:44:25] song Praise the name of our Lord a song
[1:44:28] of
[1:44:29] testimony the
[1:44:31] writer and the horse they have been
[1:44:35] thrown praise the name of the Lord a
[1:44:37] song of John giving a testimony of What
[1:44:40] the Lord Has Done in your
[1:44:43] life and so these songs also should be
[1:44:47] able to bring a power of
[1:44:50] transformation in your life praise the
[1:44:53] name of the Lord maybe when you are
[1:44:56] distress and then you hear one of these
[1:44:58] songs it must have that kind of
[1:45:02] anointing that can come and release you
[1:45:04] from any kind of
[1:45:06] bondage praise the name of our Lord when
[1:45:09] Prophet elishah was
[1:45:12] troubled and then there are three kings
[1:45:14] that had come to inquire from
[1:45:16] him then the prophet told them can you
[1:45:20] get me somebody with
[1:45:21] music and then a person with music came
[1:45:25] and then he started
[1:45:27] singing Praise the name of then the
[1:45:30] spirit of God Came Upon the
[1:45:33] prophet and that's why when we come to
[1:45:37] church let us not time to come when the
[1:45:39] preacher is going to
[1:45:42] start come and those traveling Spirits
[1:45:44] can get

[1:46:02] also clap praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:05] what is that you are being
[1:46:08] loosened you are being
[1:46:10] delivered and then as you continue in
[1:46:13] that the atmosphere completely
[1:46:18] changes somebody who came traveled from
[1:46:21] home somebody who came with this kind of
[1:46:24] distress you find yourself that all
[1:46:27] those things have gone
[1:46:29] away praise the name of our when demons
[1:46:32] were traveling
[1:46:33] s then they would bring David then David
[1:46:37] would start playing and when David was
[1:46:40] playing Saul was delivered from his TR
[1:46:44] that should be the same thing even us
[1:46:46] when we come to church let us be
[1:46:49] involved in the
[1:46:50] worship let us be involved in the song
[1:46:54] service and then you take time and then
[1:46:57] you sing with all your
[1:46:59] heart praise the name of our Lord if is
[1:47:01] a song of worship or song of Praise You

[1:47:28] music gospel music and then it can
[1:47:32] change your mind it can change the
[1:47:36] stuation praise the name of the Lord but
[1:47:39] you see many times people only want put
[1:47:42] music when they are
[1:47:45] sorrowful when you go to a funeral
[1:47:48] place they then they put music there but
[1:47:52] don't it only when you are
[1:47:54] sorrowful let it play every
[1:47:58] day praise the Lord every day Worship
[1:48:01] the Lord every day sing unto the Lord
[1:48:04] every day and that's what the Bible
[1:48:06] tells us let us go to
[1:48:09] Colossians praise the name of the Lord
[1:48:12] and then verse chapter 3 verse
[1:48:16] 16 the Bible
[1:48:18] says let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:48:22] reach in all
[1:48:24] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[1:48:27] another in Psalms and hyns and spiritual
[1:48:31] songs singing with Grace in your hearts
[1:48:33] to the Lord
[1:49:00] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[1:49:01] says singing with
[1:49:05] Grace in your hearts unto the Lord that
[1:49:09] should be our life a life of singing a
[1:49:13] life of praising a life of being
[1:49:16] thankful Lord I Thank You Lord I bless
[1:49:20] your Holy Name Lord I glorify your holy
[1:49:22] name
[1:49:23] he says you do that praise the name of
[1:49:26] the Lord if you're not singing
[1:49:29] aloud then you are singing in your heart
[1:49:32] praise the name of the Lord a Melody
[1:49:35] playing how great th art how wonderful
[1:49:39] you are what you have done for me you
[1:49:42] know when you think about what the Lord
[1:49:44] has done and then you just get into
[1:49:47] worship you get into
[1:49:50] adoration praise the name of our Lord
[1:49:53] and you just need to sing unto the
[1:49:56] Lord praise the name of our Lord in
[1:49:58] Ephesians
[1:50:03] 5:8 Ephesians
[1:50:06] 5:8 he says and be not drunk with wine
[1:50:10] wherein is excess but be filled with the
[1:50:13] spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[1:50:16] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[1:50:19] and making merod in your heart to the
[1:50:21] Lord give giving thanks always for all
[1:50:24] things unto God and the father in the
[1:50:27] name of our Lord Jesus
[1:50:50] Christ praise the name of Lord he says
[1:50:54] speaking to
[1:50:56] yourselves in Psalms in hyms in

[1:51:06] melody in your heart to the
[1:51:09] Lord praise the name of our Lord that
[1:51:12] should be our life
[1:51:14] continuously but then we have a
[1:51:18] challenge that there are many new songs
[1:51:20] that have come
[1:51:23] and I've taken
[1:51:25] over praise the name of the Lord and
[1:51:28] some of this song they only repeat one
[1:51:32] word only one word and they say it is
[1:51:35] gospel music then you also take time on
[1:51:37] only that
[1:51:40] word no praise the name of Allah we
[1:51:43] should get songs with a
[1:51:46] message songs that are really inspired
[1:51:52] songs that are ordained of the
[1:51:56] Lord now in the message blind
[1:51:59] Bas he says
[1:52:02] oh
[1:52:08] Po and things certainly th thrill my
[1:52:15] soul when I read those Godly
[1:52:21] men that brought
[1:52:23] them like the S of
[1:52:27] Life there Long
[1:52:30] Fellow then he says and I think that God
[1:52:34] P them
[1:52:37] things them men of
[1:52:41] old as it is said in the
[1:52:44] Bible moved by the Holy
[1:52:47] Spirit wrote the old blood songs
[1:52:53] I see a crimson stream of
[1:52:56] blood all those famous old songs of the
[1:53:01] church it's a lot
[1:53:03] better than some of this little old
[1:53:06] chopped up
[1:53:09] stuff we have
[1:53:12] today you know and then I tell you I
[1:53:16] love that old time
[1:53:19] religion love all those good old songs
[1:53:22] of
[1:53:25] their you know they were
[1:53:28] inspired they were not singing because
[1:53:30] of being
[1:53:32] known but you see
[1:53:35] nowadays because we have social
[1:53:38] media some people are
[1:53:41] inspired by how many likes I'm going to
[1:53:45] get everybody is saying I like it I like
[1:53:48] it by how many views I'm going to get
[1:53:53] but that should not be the
[1:53:54] inspiration the inspiration should be by
[1:53:57] the Holy Spirit to deliver the souls of
[1:54:00] the
[1:54:01] people praise the name of the Lord when
[1:54:04] some of these musicians who are
[1:54:07] secular these people are secular
[1:54:09] musicians who are
[1:54:12] secular when they see that there's a gap
[1:54:15] in gospel
[1:54:18] music then they also start singing
[1:54:23] praise the name of the Lord there are
[1:54:25] quite a number of those
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:33] songs you know they just get into a
[1:54:37] state and then bring one word about
[1:54:41] Jesus and then you say it is gospel
[1:54:45] music when they say it is Christmas
[1:54:48] time and then they talk about
[1:54:52] and then you also qualified for gospel
[1:54:55] music no praise the name of the lord
[1:54:59] it's not for
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:01] entertainment it is for
[1:55:03] worship and
[1:55:06] transformation and then you see some of
[1:55:08] these disc
[1:55:11] cools they bring some of those songs
[1:55:14] when it is we hours of the
[1:55:18] night around 300 a.m. 5 p.m. then they
[1:55:21] start putting some of those
[1:55:23] songs when they are fully
[1:55:26] drunk you know that should not be
[1:55:30] that when you listen to a true gospel
[1:55:34] song It's a
[1:55:36] gospel it's a gospel if you a sinner you
[1:55:41] are
[1:55:42] convicted praise the name of our Lord
[1:55:45] you are convicted when you listen to
[1:55:51] it and then you continue in your wicked
[1:55:54] way that's not the purpose of
[1:55:57] it praise the name of our Lord It's
[1:56:00] meant to bring the spirit of God
[1:56:03] down when they were singing this songs
[1:56:06] when they sang this song before
[1:56:08] Elisha the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:56:11] Elisha when they sang this song before
[1:56:15] King Saul the demons left King
[1:56:19] Saul they should have the same impact
[1:56:23] even right now praise the name of our
[1:56:26] Lord so we need those songs that are
[1:56:29] inspired of the holy
[1:56:32] spirit that have a
[1:56:35] message not what brother bam is saying
[1:56:37] chopped up

[1:57:31] going
[1:57:34] around praise the name of our
[1:57:37] Lord then now in this message the
[1:57:40] restoration of the Bright
[1:57:42] Tree he says now when this tree that God
[1:57:48] planted it was to Bear nine different
[1:57:51] kinds of fruit
[1:57:55] different kinds n different
[1:57:59] kinds which means nine spiritual
[1:58:04] gifts nine fruits of the
[1:58:07] spirit to go with the nine spiritual
[1:58:11] gifts that's what God's
[1:58:14] tree he planted it in the Earth on the
[1:58:17] day of
[1:58:20] Pentecost now let us stop
[1:58:23] already so limited with
[1:58:26] time I'm going to skip down here a few
[1:58:30] scriptures and go down here to
[1:58:33] Psalms the first
[1:58:35] Psalm David saw this
[1:58:38] tree a long time ago and of his
[1:58:43] writing of the songs for the something
[1:58:48] joyful that was the first thing he wrote
[1:58:51] about
[1:58:53] that is Psalms
[1:58:55] 1 you know it was a
[1:58:58] song then he said he saw the tree and it
[1:59:02] was planted by the rivers of
[1:59:05] water this tree then he said he shall be
[1:59:09] like a
[1:59:11] tree godest tree planted by the
[1:59:16] rivers plural rivers of
[1:59:20] water then he say
[1:59:22] not a
[1:59:24] Methodist Baptist
[1:59:26] Presbyterian Lutheran so forth no just
[1:59:31] rivers of one
[1:59:33] water nine spiritual
[1:59:36] gifts by The Same
[1:59:40] Spirit nine fruits of the
[1:59:43] spirit coming from the same
[1:59:47] channel he shall be like a tree planted
[1:59:50] by the rivers of what
[1:59:54] now when we look at Psalms chapter
[1:59:57] one is a song but that Psalms chapter
[2:00:01] one is a
[2:00:04] gospel it teaches you praise the name of
[2:00:07] our Lord verse one tells let us go
[2:00:10] Psalms one and verse one is a
[2:00:14] song Praise the name of our Lord and
[2:00:17] then the scripture says in verse
[2:00:19] one of Psalms 1
[2:00:23] praise the name of our Lord he says
[2:00:26] blessed is the
[2:00:29] man that WTH not in the counil of the
[2:00:35] ungodly tell me a sinner in the bar
[2:00:38] singing that
[2:00:42] song tell me if you will go back to the
[2:00:46] bar and he loves that
[2:00:48] song blessed is the man that works not
[2:00:52] in the C of the
[2:00:55] ungodly and there in the in the C of the
[2:00:59] ungodly and the thing is rebuking him
[2:01:03] how will he sing it
[2:01:06] there then and stands in the way of the
[2:01:10] Sinners he's standing in the way of
[2:01:13] Sinners sth not in the seat of the
[2:01:18] scold so the more you sing that song
[2:01:22] the more it convicts
[2:01:24] you praise the name of the Lord and when
[2:01:27] it convicts you you
[2:01:30] repent Lord have mercy upon
[2:01:33] me praise the name of our Lord I stand
[2:01:36] in the of

[2:01:41] scold I stand in the way of wicked
[2:01:44] people so it changes you it brings a
[2:01:48] transformation in your
[2:01:50] life and then vers the Bible
[2:01:54] says you know verse
[2:01:56] two is an exchange of verse
[2:02:01] one instead of sitting in the seat of
[2:02:04] the
[2:02:05] SC instead of standing in the way of
[2:02:10] Sinners instead of you know doing things
[2:02:13] which are

[2:02:19] delight is not to go to the bar
[2:02:22] praise the name of our Lord my delight
[2:02:26] is not to go to the sports
[2:02:29] betting my delight is not to go to fun
[2:02:33] places but my
[2:02:36] delight is the word of the
[2:02:38] Lord what do I do with the word of God I

[2:03:01] wife if you are hating your husband if
[2:03:05] you are hating your parents if you are

[2:03:12] Love Lifted
[2:03:15] Me from what
[2:03:18] hatred praise the name of our Lord we
[2:03:21] need to bring the songs back

[2:03:55] far oh the love of God is
[2:03:59] Rich far it will go beyond
[2:04:05] measures then you know I'm at this
[2:04:10] bound the love of God can still pick me
[2:04:13] from those bounds of sin and brings me
[2:04:16] back into

[2:04:42] Lord deliver me from this kind of
[2:04:45] situation praise the name of our Lord
[2:04:47] now in the message Lord I believe
[2:04:52] he
[2:04:54] says you know now he was under prayer
[2:04:58] line the angel of the Lord had
[2:05:01] come then he says someone holding prayer
[2:05:05] card
[2:05:08] 17 would you check someone sitting near

[2:05:16] person if they are in the
[2:05:19] building why come take your

[2:05:25] next
[2:05:27] verse then he says I am so wonderous he

[2:05:34] sin Jesus so
[2:05:37] sweetly abides with
[2:05:41] the there at the cross where he took

[2:06:25] positive
[2:06:26] confession that there to my
[2:06:29] heart the blood was
[2:06:32] applied and then you can start thinking
[2:06:34] of those
[2:06:36] areas the spots there said but Lord you
[2:06:41] delivered me from
[2:06:43] life but I'm still despising people I

[2:07:02] of our Lord so when he was singing that
[2:07:05] and then waiting for the person to come

[2:10:47] God praise the name of the Lord and
[2:10:49] that's what we need
[2:10:51] but we're living in a time of
[2:10:55] scus so that's why we need our young
[2:11:00] people under inspiration of God to write
[2:11:05] down songs Just David wrote down
[2:11:10] songs praise the name of our Lord and
[2:11:13] this we desire and God has been gracious
[2:11:17] that many started writing those songs
[2:11:20] songs you don't want to stop
[2:11:23] listening songs with such a great
[2:11:26] message songs with such a
[2:11:29] depth that they even preach to
[2:11:32] you praise the name of the
[2:11:34] Lord 3 days I've been in
[2:11:39] par and then we or we collected the
[2:11:42] churches we are trying to
[2:11:46] raise about five or six
[2:11:48] churches and then we took time preaching
[2:11:51] on marriage from Thursday up to
[2:11:55] yesterday just the way they should
[2:11:57] follow
[2:11:58] it praise the name of our Lord and then
[2:12:01] the brothers were asking
[2:12:03] me why is brother
[2:12:05] Joshua praise the name of our Lord then
[2:12:08] I started looking for a song
[2:12:11] In Praise the name of our Lord a message
[2:12:14] to
[2:12:15] them praise the name of our Lord you
[2:12:18] know something that can Bless the people
[2:12:23] praise the name of our Lord we had
[2:12:24] started putting these songs on one of
[2:12:27] our radio stations
[2:12:29] here but then the moderator was
[2:12:34] saying these songs most of them are in
[2:12:37] English and our people don't understand
[2:12:42] English so there was a challenge so we
[2:12:45] need also to bring songs in our local
[2:12:48] languages
[2:12:52] song
[2:12:53] in song
[2:12:55] ina song
[2:12:57] in a song in whatever language that it
[2:13:01] can minister to the needs of the
[2:13:04] people praise the name of the Lord that
[2:13:06] we can have a program on
[2:13:08] radios and we play those
[2:13:11] songs praise the name of our Lord which
[2:13:14] can Bless the people a song with a
[2:13:18] message praise the name of our Lord like
[2:13:21] I just like listening that song
[2:13:27] in let me tell you friends and then the
[2:13:30] message why do you baptize in the name
[2:13:32] of the Father the Son and the
[2:13:35] Holy when the name is Jesus Christ
[2:13:38] somebody sits and starts hearing
[2:13:44] someon baptizing the name of the father
[2:13:46] son is a wrong
[2:13:48] thing it's the name of Jesus Christ
[2:13:51] women preaching is a wrong
[2:13:53] thing baptizing little children is a
[2:13:55] wrong
[2:13:56] thing it's a message it's a gospel
[2:14:01] praise the name of our lord it's a
[2:14:03] preaching that's what we need praise the
[2:14:06] name of Lord not the songs that excite
[2:14:09] you a little
[2:14:10] bit you sing the same
[2:14:13] [Applause]
[2:14:14] Stan no
[2:14:19] gospel praise the name of Lord then
[2:14:22] brother Bram
[2:14:25] says okay let us go to another one
[2:14:28] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[2:14:30] message blind
[2:14:32] Bas he said I was thinking
[2:14:36] of a
[2:14:39] blind it's a little off my subject but
[2:14:42] not not so
[2:14:46] off there was blind fun crossb
[2:14:52] funny cross
[2:14:56] cross she could see better than a lot of
[2:15:00] people go to
[2:15:07] eyes but she was
[2:15:10] blind then he says they try to get
[2:15:14] her one
[2:15:16] time to write
[2:15:19] music for a dance
[2:15:24] world for the entertainment
[2:15:27] world and she refused to do
[2:15:30] it so they were making fun of
[2:15:33] her I thought what a
[2:15:37] difference it is between her and a
[2:15:39] certain young Pentecostal
[2:15:43] boy who set the world a fire with rock
[2:15:46] and roll
[2:15:51] rock and
[2:15:53] roll he was talking about Elvis
[2:15:57] prle you know he was a Pentecostal on
[2:16:00] Sunday is in church
[2:16:02] worshiping Friday night is in Disco
[2:16:05] halls and
[2:16:08] everything that kind of thing then he
[2:16:14] says I've often thought that is worse
[2:16:16] than Judas
[2:16:21] es saw this bir
[2:16:23] right and what a horrible thing that
[2:16:25] young man will have to answer for the
[2:16:27] day of
[2:16:30] judgment sent more souls to H than all
[2:16:33] the bootle joints that is in the
[2:16:39] country and then when F
[2:16:43] cross one day they come to
[2:16:47] her with big bargains
[2:16:52] she was
[2:16:53] poor and they come to her and said we
[2:16:57] will give you so much we'll give you so
[2:17:02] much if you'll just give your
[2:17:05] talent over to making songs for the
[2:17:08] entertainment
[2:17:10] world you know the devil is
[2:17:13] tricky he identifies your gift and he
[2:17:17] wants you to trade your
[2:17:19] gift for the world
[2:17:22] and you see many of these secular
[2:17:25] musicians they started from
[2:17:28] church playing instruments what like I
[2:17:32] remember there's a lady who died and
[2:17:34] then I think she either something in
[2:17:36] America I think she was
[2:17:39] hon and she said started from a church
[2:17:43] church like that then the entertainment
[2:17:46] World took her
[2:17:49] over so now they were challenging this
[2:17:53] sister funny
[2:17:55] Crosby CR to enter to write songs for
[2:17:59] the entertainment
[2:18:02] world and she was blond she couldn't

[2:18:35] known now you do this like this you

[2:18:52] she flat refused
[2:18:54] it she would not do it she said if there
[2:18:59] is anything that I
[2:19:02] have it belongs to Christ praise the
[2:19:05] name of our Lord that should be the same

[2:19:14] me it belongs to Jesus Christ praise the
[2:19:18] name of our Lord all the life I live
[2:19:21] it belongs to Jesus Christ and then he
[2:19:23] said and so the men who were talking to
[2:19:28] her say then I
[2:19:32] suppose you are expecting to go to a
[2:19:35] world where there's everlasting
[2:19:39] life and so forth she said
[2:19:42] yes then they said what do you expect
[2:19:46] this Christ to
[2:19:48] be say it be a
[2:19:52] man now she was a blind person they were

[2:19:55] to who would be this
[2:19:58] Christ she will be he will be a
[2:20:01] man and said then if you are the same
[2:20:04] over there as you are
[2:20:07] [Music]
[2:20:13] here you never seen him say it you are
[2:20:18] blind she said oh will know him
[2:20:23] anyhow so they
[2:20:25] said how would do you ever know
[2:20:28] him if you are still blind over
[2:20:33] there as you never had cited in this
[2:20:37] life on the other side if you had no

[2:21:04] the Lord It's a message going to the
[2:21:06] people God has
[2:21:09] chosen praise the name of our Lord and
[2:21:11] then he
[2:21:13] said so she
[2:21:15] said say how would you ever know
[2:21:18] him if you are blind
[2:21:21] he said I will know
[2:21:23] him and they laughed at her and she
[2:21:27] turned and setted through the
[2:21:29] house and when she had made her
[2:21:32] decision no sir nothing of the world all
[2:21:37] my talent is to
[2:21:39] Christ they said she started back across
[2:21:42] the house and raised up our hearts and
[2:21:46] said I shall know him I shall know him
[2:21:51] and Redeemed by his side I shall stand
[2:21:55] they challenged her she made the right
[2:21:58] decision I shall know him and
[2:22:01] immediately the inspiration of the song
[2:22:05] struck I shall know him praise the name
[2:22:08] of the Lord those are exp have been
[2:22:11] passing
[2:22:13] through I shall know him like I remember

[2:22:19] in a great number
[2:22:22] here I'm just forgetting the
[2:22:25] song and this song was sung by Brother
[2:22:29] William and it was
[2:22:32] strange the message of the song
[2:22:35] reflected his station at that
[2:22:38] time he was sick he was put on a
[2:22:42] canul dripping he goes there they treat
[2:22:46] him and then he comes and sings Here
[2:22:50] praise the name of the Lord some of
[2:22:52] these songs have a
[2:22:54] depth and the meaning sometimes is even
[2:22:57] reflected
[2:23:00] physically like the children of Israel
[2:23:03] when they had crossed the Red Sea and
[2:23:05] then they saw their enemies on the
[2:23:08] water a song came forth a new song came
[2:23:12] forth and even now the sister f
[2:23:15] crossb they challenging her you are
[2:23:19] blind how you know him then God inspired
[2:23:22] her I shall know him I will touch at his
[2:23:26] hands and then I will know this is my
[2:23:29] Lord praise the name of our Lord so we
[2:23:32] need to really see that our
[2:23:36] songs have a depth to them brings
[2:23:40] Deliverance to
[2:23:41] us praise the name of our Lord and not
[2:23:44] only this are singing But even us let us
[2:23:48] be taken by the spirit of
[2:23:51] worship praise the name of our Lord to
[2:23:54] know this message is mine this song is
[2:23:58] mine this song is ministering to my
[2:24:01] name praise the name of our Lord and
[2:24:04] then he says by the prince of the nails
[2:24:06] in his
[2:24:15] hand it is those great crucial
[2:24:19] moments that that the strain is put upon
[2:24:24] us God moves
[2:24:26] in when we make the decision for
[2:24:29] him that's between life and
[2:24:32] death that little sharp
[2:24:35] ede sometime at the last moment when you
[2:24:38] are you think you are not going to be
[2:24:42] well and somebody is making fun of
[2:24:46] you still hold your testimony
[2:24:50] it's that time that God
[2:24:53] moves praise the name of our Lord I want
[2:24:56] to get also another one
[2:24:58] here praise the name of our Lord I see
[2:25:01] my time has
[2:25:03] gone so then he says in the another
[2:25:07] message God in his
[2:25:09] people praise the name of our Lord he
[2:25:12] says that old fun
[2:25:16] crossb okay let us start from this one
[2:25:18] he says one time there was was a
[2:25:21] man he was writing one
[2:25:24] day and he was
[2:25:28] right trying to write a
[2:25:31] song he couldn't do it and he didn't
[2:25:35] know what to do and all at once there
[2:25:40] was a song that came to another
[2:25:43] man by the name of Eddie
[2:25:47] ponet Ed sitting in a room
[2:25:51] and suddenly there came a spirit of God
[2:25:55] upon him and he grabbed his pain and he
[2:25:59] wrote All held the power of Jesus's
[2:26:05] name let Angels prostrate
[2:26:08] for bring forth their Royal
[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:14] D and crown him Lord of

[5:09:05] you Hallelujah
[5:09:11] we are still around my colleagues were
[5:09:13] running away so um the next song is
[5:09:17] called
[5:09:38] good for
[5:10:37] Hallelujah I've been struggling you know
[5:10:39] I'm at
[5:10:40] all um but he's
[5:10:43] good and U the Bible says God will do
[5:10:46] nothing which he has not revealed so
[5:10:49] yeah even this that just happened God
[5:10:51] knew it that it will happen and um I
[5:10:56] wrote this song um some years back I
[5:11:00] think it's
[5:11:01] 21 yeah around there and uh I wrote it
[5:11:06] during u a suon which was being preached
[5:11:10] by Brother andrias
[5:11:13] Ren I I happened not to have attended
[5:11:16] the first service so I attended the
[5:11:18] afternoon
[5:11:19] service but as you know if we accustomed
[5:11:22] to brother and rers preaching they'll
[5:11:25] start preaching before you even sit down
[5:11:27] so I didn't grasp the the the the title
[5:11:31] of the salmon well so I can't really
[5:11:34] figure it out what the title was but the
[5:11:38] message is I
[5:11:40] got and U you know I love visiting
[5:11:44] ministers because they always bring A
[5:11:48] New Perspective to certain things you
[5:11:50] know and when you writer the converse
[5:11:53] you work with are
[5:11:55] ideas perspective
[5:11:58] experiences but the way this man was
[5:12:01] preaching about the goodness of God was
[5:12:05] something that would really make you
[5:12:07] start scratching your head
[5:12:10] you know he says God will do nothing
[5:12:13] which he has not
[5:12:15] revealed and then the the most really uh
[5:12:20] great line in his preaching that caught
[5:12:22] my eye he said God becomes good when
[5:12:26] evil happens in your life and then as I
[5:12:29] was still processing that he said
[5:12:33] um um can you flash for me the the
[5:12:37] second verse
[5:12:41] yeah he said you see evil is permitted
[5:12:45] but not
[5:12:47] excused I took some time digesting
[5:12:50] that and then as I was to
[5:12:53] digesting he
[5:12:56] said God is confident that
[5:12:59] you his child you will win all you have
[5:13:04] to do is blow up the devil I didn't know
[5:13:06] that we actually supposed to blow up the
[5:13:08] devil so that was quite an interesting
[5:13:10] interesting lines there but all of
[5:14:08] in
[5:14:13] God
[5:14:15] do he
[5:14:19] has just be confident his intention and
[5:14:25] everything God will do
[5:14:27] [Music]
[5:14:29] nothing he has
[5:14:34] not just be
[5:14:37] confident and never
[5:14:41] he's
[5:14:42] good join us quite a simple
[5:14:46] song Jesus is good God becomes good when
[5:14:51] evil happens in

[5:27:57] 824 paragraph 33
[5:28:08] says now God made a contract with the

[5:59:35] the inspiration we pick it from Luke
[5:59:38] 22 vers
[5:59:40] 31 and 32 the Bible says and the Lord
[5:59:44] said Simon Simon behold Satan has desire
[5:59:49] to have you that he may shift you as we
[5:59:52] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[5:59:55] faith fail not and when thou art
[5:59:58] converted strengthen thy bre bless
[6:00:02] you and then says master
[6:00:06] I want to walk to
[6:00:08] you I don't know how far he
[6:00:10] was from the boat and the
[6:00:14] [Music]
[6:00:15] master and then he began to
[6:00:18] walk but the master
[6:00:21] himself knows how to prove that it's not
[6:00:26] ourselves but it is him he allowed the
[6:00:29] stor to
[6:00:31] come and when the storm came the faith
[6:00:35] of Peter
[6:00:37] was diminishing in the face of a
[6:00:40] stone and he was sinking but the faith
[6:00:44] of Jesus Christ the gift of God extended
[6:00:48] the hand and he was able to walk on the
[6:00:52] water amen by the gift of
[6:00:55] faith which is the faith of the Lord
[6:00:58] Jesus
[6:00:59] Christ and now it's the same
[6:01:02] Faith which has saved you he doesn't
[6:01:06] save you today to lose you tomorrow I'm
[6:01:09] not saying you will not make mistakes in
[6:01:13] life but because it's the Faith of
[6:01:17] Christ he prayed for you so that your
[6:01:21] faith
[6:01:23] not amen and so by this faith we
[6:01:28] continue our PRM
