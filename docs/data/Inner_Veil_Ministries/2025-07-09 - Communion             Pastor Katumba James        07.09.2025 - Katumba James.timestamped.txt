[0:54] Every promise in the book is mine. Every
[1:00] chapter, every chapter, every verse,
[1:05] every line.
[1:08] And I am trusting in his love divine.
[1:15] For every promise in the book is mine.
[1:21] Every promise, every promise, you can
[1:25] confess it this morning. Every chapter,
[1:28] every verse,
[1:30] &gt;&gt; every line,
[1:33] every line,
[1:34] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting in his love divine.
[1:39] in his love divine.
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Every promise in the book, every
[1:48] promise in the Bible, every promise,
[1:51] every promise in the book, it's given to
[1:55] you. You come with expectation, you
[1:58] receive it.
[2:00] Every verse and every line. I am
[2:04] trusting. I am trusting in his love
[2:09] divine.
[2:11] Every promise, every promising
[2:15] &gt;&gt; as you sing it.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, every promise.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; You need healing, it is in the book.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; You need him to provide for you, it is
[2:27] in the book.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; So, you just have to confess this
[2:30] morning. Oh, I am trusting. I am
[2:35] trusting in his love divine.
[2:40] Every promise, every promise in the book
[2:45] is mine.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, every promise.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; I want to hear your confession.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Every chapter, every verse,
[2:56] &gt;&gt; every chapter, every verse,
[2:59] &gt;&gt; every line,
[3:00] &gt;&gt; every line

[3:09] Every promise, every promise in the book
[3:14] is mine. Amen. We give him a hand of
[3:18] praise. Amen.
[3:22] You may be seated.
[3:24] Every promise
[3:27] that is written in the word
[3:31] is ours.
[3:33] So you just have to come expecting
[3:38] as the pastor was saying
[3:42] as he was saying in the morning
[3:44] exaltation.
[3:48] He said come expecting in his presence
[3:54] and what you expect
[3:56] that is what you receive.
[3:59] If you come to look for mistakes,
[4:02] you find them. But if you come to seek
[4:05] the face of God,
[4:08] you surely see him.
[4:11] Amen. So it is always important how do
[4:14] we approach God
[4:18] claim every promise in the
[4:22] Amen. Amen.
[4:24] I want to sing this Loga song with you.

[4:36] it's a bit
[4:38] tricky, but we we will have to use the
[4:41] keyboard being that it is a guitar
[4:44] oriented song,

[51:51] Wilfred.
[51:54] He says, "Dear brethren,
[51:57] I greet you all in the name of our Lord
[51:59] Jesus Christ.
[52:02] It has been a tough situation for me and
[52:04] my family
[52:08] because on 31st last month.
[52:12] I was hospitalized when I was in a
[52:14] critical situation
[52:18] and the doctors stated that I'm
[52:20] suffering from liver disorder.
[52:27] But I'm glad I was discharged on

[53:03] support us financially
[53:06] and also pray for us. Thank you so much.

[53:14] once again. Thank you so much.
[53:16] I'm forever grateful
[53:20] because this is not easy. May the
[53:22] almighty God bless you
[53:25] all your heart's desires
[53:28] each and every one of you. I really
[53:30] thank God for the recover of our

[53:49] being with us this morning.
[53:52] Praise the name of our Lord. So our
[53:54] pastor is in Cavalary.
[53:57] He went to with Pastor George Franklin
[54:02] then
[54:08] that was on Monday. And I've been having
[54:11] meetings every day
[54:15] from 8:00
[54:18] up to 10 in the night.
[54:22] Praise the name of our Lord. And there
[54:25] were so many ministers in those
[54:26] meetings.
[54:30] So you talk about having two services
[54:32] only.
[54:37] Those are having from eight
[54:40] up to 10.
[54:44] So if we have if we are spending here
[54:45] the whole day
[54:48] not even the whole day from 9
[54:52] to 6
[54:54] like today shouldn't be too much.
[55:00] Praise the name of so we just keep them
[55:03] in our prayers.
[55:05] They'll be traveling back tomorrow.
[55:08] Then there are also other meetings that
[55:10] are taking place.
[55:12] In Kala there are two conventions.
[55:16] I don't know why at the same time
[55:19] but there is a convention in
[55:23] and then in
[55:25] they've all been running I think from

[55:32] on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
[55:37] there are meetings in
[55:40] and our pastor will be preaching in
[55:41] those meetings.
[55:44] I would encourage you
[55:46] you can attend the meetings on Friday

[55:51] that will be very good. Then there are
[55:54] also meetings in
[55:57] that's

[56:12] That's for from Wednesday to Sunday.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; And then they'll be having a crusade
[56:20] from 3 p.m. to 700 p.m.
[56:27] I told the brother there
[56:30] maybe I'll be there on Thursday.
[56:34] because we also have other activities we
[56:36] engage ourselves in.
[56:38] We have our Wednesday service. We can't
[56:41] close the church.
[56:43] And then on
[56:45] the other days, Friday and Saturday, I
[56:47] wanted to be ina
[56:52] we are back here again.
[56:54] So today we have two services
[56:57] and the Lord's supper
[56:59] starting at 5:00
[57:02] and then foot washing.
[57:04] Then next Sunday
[57:06] we're also going to have two services.
[57:10] We are going to have the morning service
[57:11] for all of us
[57:14] and then we are going to have the
[57:15] afternoon service
[57:18] for the youth
[57:21] who are in school.
[57:23] Praise the name of our Lord. But we may
[57:26] not refuse those who are who are out of
[57:28] school to attend that.
[57:31] But at the end of the month,
[57:34] we shall be having a youth meeting.
[57:37] But for those out of school
[57:41] and if you in school, we're not going to
[57:43] allow you in that meeting.

[57:55] &gt;&gt; So we are also not going to have our
[57:58] praying and fasting meetings on
[58:00] Saturday.
[58:03] Maybe shall love it after the coming
[58:04] weekend.
[58:07] The Lord being gracious.
[58:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Then after
[58:12] this service,
[58:14] I want the youth to remain
[58:17] just to talk with them for only 10
[58:18] minutes
[58:20] before we go for lunch. Then we come
[58:23] back in the afternoon.
[58:25] So then I'll invite brother William and
[58:27] the team before.
[58:31] Amen. Amen.
[59:10] When sin came and could not worship
[59:15] without the blood,
[59:19] God came to fellowship
[59:23] with man. He found him not.
[59:28] He called Adam. Adam, where are you? I'm
[59:35] hidden. Could not bear God's presence
[59:40] without the blood.
[59:44] [Music]
[59:46] Eating from the tree of knowledge. Good
[59:51] and evil cause death. A state of
[59:56] nakedness.
[59:59] Man had fig leaves covered around them.
[1:00:04] A blood sacrifice
[1:00:07] of goats and skins. God meant to clothe
[1:00:11] them. Restoring life and fellowship
[1:00:16] with man again.
[1:00:19] Oh, the life
[1:00:21] for the life of the flesh is in the
[1:00:27] blood.
[1:00:30] And I have given it to you upon the
[1:00:36] altar.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And it's the blood that makes atonement
[1:00:45] for my soul.
[1:00:48] and makes me fellowship
[1:00:52] with God once again.
[1:00:59] When Jesus gave up the cost at Calary,
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:08] body sings suffering, his blood dripping
[1:01:14] down the altar,
[1:01:17] a perfect sacrifice,
[1:01:21] cleansing a sinner just like me,
[1:01:25] granting me access to fellowship. ship
[1:01:30] with God again
[1:01:33] for the life for the life of the flesh
[1:01:39] is in the blood.
[1:01:44] I have given me to you upon the altar.
[1:01:53] And
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; it's the blood that makes atonement
[1:01:59] for my soul
[1:02:03] and makes me fellowship
[1:02:06] with God once again
[1:02:12] and fall I've sinned
[1:02:16] and fallen short of the glory of God
[1:02:23] and the wages of man sin we caused all
[1:02:28] death.
[1:02:32] But at the cross of Calvary,
[1:02:36] Jesus poured his blood for
[1:02:42] giving me a newness of life
[1:02:48] for the life. is for the life of the
[1:02:54] flesh is in the blood
[1:03:00] and I have given the need to you upon
[1:03:06] the altar.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; It's the blood
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It's the blood that makes atonement
[1:03:15] for my soul
[1:03:19] and makes me fellowship
[1:03:22] with God once again.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it's the blood that makes
[1:03:32] atonement
[1:03:34] for my soul
[1:03:38] and makes me fellowship
[1:03:42] with God
[1:03:45] again.
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:51] It's the blood that makes atonement for
[1:03:54] us.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So today I
[1:03:59] took interest to minister on communion.
[1:04:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[1:04:07] stand up and have a word of prayer.
[1:04:12] Amen. Amen. Our father, we thank you
[1:04:17] again.
[1:04:19] We now commit the reading of the word
[1:04:21] into your hands.
[1:04:24] May the Holy Spirit come and minister to
[1:04:26] us
[1:04:28] according as we have needs.
[1:04:31] Speak to our hearts father. May we also
[1:04:34] receive from you Lord
[1:04:36] that father you may help us in our
[1:04:39] journey while we are still here on earth
[1:04:43] to be able to live a life
[1:04:46] that is acceptable before you bless us
[1:04:49] all together
[1:04:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus who grant
[1:04:53] us.
[1:04:55] Amen. Amen. Let us go to first
[1:04:57] Corinthians
[1:05:00] chapter 10
[1:05:02] from verse 16 to verse 22.
[1:05:15] Verse 22.
[1:05:20] The Bible says, "The cup of blessing
[1:05:24] which we bless, is it not the communion
[1:05:27] of the blood of Christ? The bread which
[1:05:30] we break, is it not the communion of the
[1:05:32] body of Christ?
[1:05:50] For we being many are one bread and one
[1:05:54] body. For we are all partakers of that
[1:05:58] one bread.
[1:06:08] Behold, Israel after the flesh are not
[1:06:11] they which eat of the sacrifice partake
[1:06:14] of the altar.
[1:06:23] What say I then that the idol is
[1:06:27] anything? All that which is offered in
[1:06:30] sacrifice to idols is anything.
[1:06:41] But I say that the things which the
[1:06:44] Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to
[1:06:47] devils and not to God. And I would note
[1:06:50] that you should have fellowship with
[1:06:52] devils.
[1:07:11] You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
[1:07:14] the cup of devils. You cannot be
[1:07:17] partakers of the Lord's table and of the
[1:07:19] tables of the devil.
[1:07:33] Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are
[1:07:36] we stronger than he?
[1:07:43] May God of his word.
[1:07:47] So our subject is communion.
[1:07:53] Praise the name of our Lord. is a very
[1:07:56] wide thing to talk about communion.
[1:08:01] I don't know the Holy Spirit removed
[1:08:02] this morning,
[1:08:05] but I felt maybe since we're going to
[1:08:07] have communion in the night,
[1:08:12] it takes some kind of detailed study,
[1:08:16] but I don't know which direction.
[1:08:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:08:22] communion
[1:08:24] is you know like when you look at that
[1:08:26] word communion in verse 16
[1:08:33] it comes like from the word communicate
[1:08:38] you know so you communicate
[1:08:42] so there is a talking
[1:08:45] an exchange
[1:08:47] so there is a participation
[1:08:51] You know all of you praise the name of
[1:08:54] our Lord like husband and wife. They
[1:08:58] have to communicate.
[1:09:00] So they commune.
[1:09:04] They sit at the same table,
[1:09:06] eat the same food,
[1:09:09] share different kind of things
[1:09:12] and their union
[1:09:14] brings children.
[1:09:16] Commun. It is kind of like communion,
[1:09:20] you know, and kind of like interaction,
[1:09:26] depth interaction.
[1:09:29] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:09:31] the same thing also the Lord calls us
[1:09:34] to,
[1:09:36] you know, to have a communion with the
[1:09:38] Lord.
[1:09:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Just that
[1:09:43] kind of depth with the Lord.
[1:09:47] You know, you talk with him.
[1:09:50] He talks with you.
[1:09:52] Like for example in Genesis 18,
[1:09:57] the Lord visited Abraham
[1:10:01] and you know Abraham
[1:10:03] saw three men coming
[1:10:06] and then he ran to them
[1:10:09] and then he bowed down and said, "Oh
[1:10:13] Lord,
[1:10:14] you have found favor before you
[1:10:18] don't pass by me." Now you see that kind
[1:10:22] of relationship
[1:10:25] is calling him for communion
[1:10:29] you know it is hot
[1:10:32] you're going to sit down we going to
[1:10:34] make for you butter
[1:10:37] for you
[1:10:40] and of course when you have visitors
[1:10:43] you interact with them that was
[1:10:46] communion
[1:10:47] so the Lord came praise the name over
[1:10:51] and he communed with Abraham
[1:10:54] you know
[1:10:56] then he said where is your wife Sarah
[1:10:59] she's this way then after
[1:11:03] the Bible says the two angels went to
[1:11:06] Sodom
[1:11:08] but then Abraham
[1:11:10] he remained with God
[1:11:13] in Genesis chapter 18
[1:11:16] and go to verse 33
[1:11:19] praise the name of our Lord.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:33,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; the scripture says,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; "And the Lord went his way as soon as he
[1:11:33] had left communing with Abraham, and
[1:11:36] Abraham returned to his place."
[1:11:46] So the communion
[1:11:49] when the two angels had left
[1:11:53] and then God was telling Abraham,
[1:11:56] this is what is going to happen to
[1:11:58] Sodom.
[1:12:00] And then Abraham took interest.
[1:12:03] Lord, will you destroy the righteous
[1:12:06] with the unrighteous?
[1:12:09] So Abraham would ask God
[1:12:12] in verse 3023.
[1:12:15] And Abraham say near
[1:12:19] and said, "Will you also destroy the
[1:12:22] righteous with the unrighteous?"
[1:12:31] 50 righteous in the city.
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:35] Will you also destroy and not spare the
[1:12:38] place for 50 righteous that are there in
[1:12:46] that be far from thee to do this after
[1:12:48] this manner?
[1:12:51] Let the righteous win the wicked
[1:12:55] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:12:56] wicked
[1:12:59] that be far from you.
[1:13:02] Shall not the judge of all the earth do
[1:13:04] right?
[1:13:08] And even us when we go to our in our
[1:13:10] prayers
[1:13:12] you know you start telling God
[1:13:15] troubles
[1:13:16] fear you know this thing is happening to
[1:13:19] me this thing has troubled me a lot
[1:13:23] I'm having a lot of you know talking
[1:13:28] but the challenge is we don't wait
[1:13:31] enough
[1:13:32] for him to talk back to us.
[1:13:36] Praise the name of our Lord. But God has
[1:13:38] ears to hear
[1:13:41] and he has the mouth to hear.
[1:13:44] But for you only want to use his ear,
[1:13:47] but you don't want to use his mouth.
[1:13:51] Assuming you know it's a relationship
[1:13:54] maybe husband and wife and the wife
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:00] or the husband
[1:14:03] and then the other one is just seated
[1:14:04] there.
[1:14:07] Then you start wondering hey where is
[1:14:10] the communion here now?
[1:14:13] Oh, he's talking. You don't care what
[1:14:15] they talking.
[1:14:17] But then Abraham talked.
[1:14:21] Lord, you look at this kind of
[1:14:22] situation.
[1:14:24] Look at this kind of thing. You know,
[1:14:26] because God had come down
[1:14:29] and the Lord came down to where Abraham
[1:14:31] was.
[1:14:34] Abraham, you know, expressed his
[1:14:35] feelings to God.
[1:14:39] We have a personal relationship with
[1:14:41] God.
[1:14:43] We also express our feelings to God
[1:14:47] like anas
[1:14:49] a prophet when the Lord told him go to
[1:14:54] Saul
[1:14:56] and pray for himas
[1:14:58] told the Lord
[1:15:00] you don't know this man
[1:15:03] he has killed your disciples
[1:15:06] and he has authority to go everywhere
[1:15:11] Everybody
[1:15:13] is deadly. Lord,
[1:15:16] the Lord didn't keep quiet. The Lord
[1:15:19] talked back.
[1:15:21] I've chosen him as my vessel.
[1:15:25] Communion.
[1:15:27] Then when Anas went to the house of
[1:15:30] where Saul was,
[1:15:33] he called him brother Saul.
[1:15:37] Praise the name of communion.
[1:15:40] We should have a relationship with God.
[1:15:44] Don't look at God as judgmental God.
[1:15:49] Don't look at God as so wrathful.
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:15:53] Look at him as your creator.
[1:15:56] If he created you,
[1:16:00] if he gives you what you have need of,
[1:16:03] why would you allow the devil
[1:16:06] to put a negative thought in your mind
[1:16:10] about God?
[1:16:12] And that's why the devil wants to take
[1:16:14] many of us.
[1:16:16] You know, you start cursing.
[1:16:18] You start saying, "Why did God make
[1:16:20] this?"
[1:16:22] But you are not seeing the goodness of
[1:16:24] God
[1:16:26] in what he's doing in your life.
[1:16:29] Then the Bible says we should give
[1:16:31] thanks at all times.
[1:16:35] Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[1:16:37] Abraham talked to God.
[1:16:40] And then the Lord talked back.
[1:16:42] And then the Lord said in verse 26, "And
[1:16:46] the Lord said, I find 50
[1:16:50] souls in righteous in Sodom,
[1:16:56] I will spare the place for their sake.
[1:17:05] So God desires us to commune with him,
[1:17:10] to communicate
[1:17:13] exchange
[1:17:15] and this should not only be on Sunday as
[1:17:17] we are here
[1:17:20] you know like in the preaching of the
[1:17:21] word the lord is speaking to that's why
[1:17:25] when we come for the services
[1:17:28] a preacher has ministered
[1:17:31] let us have also time
[1:17:34] there's something the lord is speaking
[1:17:36] to you
[1:17:38] also need to speak back
[1:17:40] I've been doing a mistake
[1:17:43] Lord, I've been erroring with this.
[1:17:46] Forgive me for that. Give me the ability
[1:17:50] to overcome this weak point, to overcome
[1:17:53] this failure in my life. Speaking to him
[1:17:56] and the Lord would want to hear from
[1:17:58] you.
[1:18:00] What do you say about this? The Bible
[1:18:02] says, "Come, let us reason together."
[1:18:07] And brother Brandham preaches about a
[1:18:09] conference.
[1:18:11] is talking. There are decisions to make.
[1:18:16] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[1:18:18] angels visited Lord and then they were
[1:18:21] telling Lord run to the mountain,
[1:18:24] Lord said oh no my Lord.
[1:18:27] Then they said okay you run to this
[1:18:28] place. There was a communion.
[1:18:32] You know there's a decision to make and
[1:18:35] that's the same thing we should do with
[1:18:37] our life.
[1:18:39] You don't on Sunday on Wednesday.
[1:18:43] Every day be in continuous communion
[1:18:46] with God.
[1:18:49] Communicate with God. Talk with God. Let
[1:18:53] him talk to you. Praise the name of our
[1:18:55] Lord. And when he talks to you, you
[1:18:58] know, obey what he's telling you. Follow
[1:19:01] what he's telling you. Praise the name
[1:19:03] of our Lord. There was a time, brother
[1:19:05] Brandham was in a hunting tree.
[1:19:09] And then now he told God, I will not
[1:19:12] kill animals for for just fun.
[1:19:17] Anyhow, like that. I will only shoot
[1:19:20] because I want to eat.
[1:19:23] And you know the Lord always desires to
[1:19:26] prove what we tell you.
[1:19:29] So now he was moving and then when they
[1:19:33] of course that was not immediately
[1:19:36] sometimes we say and we forget
[1:19:40] oh Lord this year I'm going to do this
[1:19:41] for you.
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:45] Praise the name of our Lord. And the
[1:19:47] Lord waits on you today.
[1:19:54] I understood God knows the situation I'm
[1:19:56] going through.
[1:20:00] So, so brother Brham was moving and then
[1:20:04] there are animals that came
[1:20:08] moving in front of him.
[1:20:11] He had the gun.
[1:20:13] God wanted to prove it.
[1:20:16] You said you're not going to shoot
[1:20:17] anyhow.
[1:20:20] So when that went
[1:20:23] then the Lord reminded him that you've
[1:20:26] kept your promise.
[1:20:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Just like
[1:20:30] you have a friend
[1:20:32] I'm coming at this time and then you
[1:20:35] don't come. You know the Bible says
[1:20:40] if you put your confidence
[1:20:44] let me get the scripture
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; because these are things we go through
[1:20:47] every other day.
[1:20:50] Praise the name of our Lord. If you put
[1:20:52] your confidence
[1:20:54] in untrusted man,
[1:20:59] you are like a joint
[1:21:02] out of order.
[1:21:08] When a snake is coming,
[1:21:11] you want to run.
[1:21:13] It is loose. You can't run away.
[1:21:17] Now that's we shouldn't be like that.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. In the book
[1:21:22] of Proverbs,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 25 and verse 19,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; "Confidence in unfaithful man in the
[1:21:41] time of trouble.
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:50] is like a broken tooth
[1:21:54] and a foot out of joint.
[1:21:58] You you you want to eat meat.
[1:22:02] Let me say like this. You've reached
[1:22:07] and then you're salvating for that
[1:22:09] roasted chicken.
[1:22:13] You've you've already given them 6,000
[1:22:17] they have given you. You try to put in
[1:22:20] the mouth
[1:22:22] but one tooth is broken.
[1:22:24] You want to eat but the tooth is not
[1:22:26] there.
[1:22:29] Then he says you are like a foot out of
[1:22:32] joint.
[1:22:34] You can't run when there is trouble
[1:22:38] and we shouldn't behave like that.
[1:22:40] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us be
[1:22:43] reliable
[1:22:46] when time for service has come.
[1:22:50] Let us be dependable.
[1:22:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[1:22:54] reliable.
[1:22:56] Be somebody one can b on.
[1:23:00] Be somebody can lean on.
[1:23:04] And that's what communion should bring
[1:23:06] us to.
[1:23:08] Then you can know that what I'm saying
[1:23:09] is taking it serious.
[1:23:13] I'm not taking it lightly.
[1:23:16] I thought you were joking.
[1:23:20] That's a foot out of joint.
[1:23:23] Broken tooth. It can't serve its
[1:23:25] purpose.
[1:23:27] So now when we come for communion
[1:23:30] or when we are having communion,
[1:23:34] there is some form of confidence that is
[1:23:36] built.
[1:23:39] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:23:41] Now let us go to first 2 Corinthians
[1:23:44] chapter 6.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 14,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; be ye not unequally yolked together with
[1:23:56] unbelievers. For what fellowship has
[1:23:59] righteousness with unrighteousness? And
[1:24:02] what communion has light with darkness?
[1:24:06] 2 Corinthians chapter 6.
[1:24:35] So communion
[1:24:37] is the same word as fellowship.
[1:24:42] Then he says, "How
[1:24:45] can unbelievers
[1:24:48] have fellowship with believers?"
[1:24:52] Communion
[1:24:54] because everybody is participating.
[1:24:59] There's somebody everybody is bringing
[1:25:01] something there.
[1:25:04] Now this unbeliever is talking about
[1:25:07] things which are dirty.
[1:25:11] Then for you a believer,
[1:25:13] you are there also saying ah
[1:25:17] this one is my best friend.
[1:25:20] What fellowship do you have?
[1:25:22] What communion do you have? Then the
[1:25:25] Bible says
[1:25:27] how can light and darkness commune?
[1:25:33] How can darkness
[1:25:35] and light stay together?
[1:25:39] One has to give room for the other.
[1:25:43] And that's the same thing. If light
[1:25:46] comes,
[1:25:48] darkness will go away. If light lives,
[1:25:53] automatically it is dark. Same thing in
[1:25:56] our lives. What do we desire in our
[1:25:59] lives?
[1:26:00] what we put most of our time into.
[1:26:04] Praise the name of our Lord, what do you
[1:26:06] commune with?
[1:26:08] Then the Bible says, "What conquered has
[1:26:11] Christ with burial?" Verse 15,
[1:26:18] or what part has the believer with
[1:26:20] unbeliever?
[1:26:26] What agreement has the temple of God
[1:26:28] with idols?
[1:26:32] For you are the temple of the living
[1:26:34] God.
[1:26:37] As God has said, I will dwell in them. I
[1:26:41] will walk in them and I will be their
[1:26:44] God.
[1:26:46] I they shall be my people.
[1:26:49] Praise the name of communion.
[1:26:53] God would that communion with us
[1:26:57] where he can come and live with us,
[1:27:00] walk within us, express himself within
[1:27:03] us and it's to open it for him.
[1:27:08] Praise the name of our Lord because he
[1:27:10] desires.
[1:27:12] Praise the name of our Lord. He had
[1:27:14] fellowship with Adam
[1:27:16] and Eve at the cool of the day
[1:27:20] talking with them. Every day he would
[1:27:22] come. But now when sin came, it brought
[1:27:26] that separation.
[1:27:29] It distorted the communion.
[1:27:32] It distorted the fellowship
[1:27:36] until they were afraid to go into the
[1:27:38] presence of God.
[1:27:40] And whenever you are also afraid
[1:27:43] to go into the presence of God,
[1:27:46] it means your communion,
[1:27:50] there's something wrong with it.
[1:27:52] That means there are some evil spirits
[1:27:57] that are drawing you away that are
[1:28:00] taking you into a wrong place.
[1:28:03] So you need to make sure that your heart
[1:28:06] condition
[1:28:08] you can freely commune with the Lord.
[1:28:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Continuous
[1:28:14] fellowship.
[1:28:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:28:19] Exodus chapter 25
[1:28:23] and then verse 22.
[1:28:26] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:28:28] So the Lord was telling Moses
[1:28:32] about the seat.
[1:28:36] When at the on the top of the master
[1:28:39] seat
[1:28:41] there I will meet with you
[1:28:47] fellowship. There has to be a meeting.
[1:28:51] There has to be some kind of coming
[1:28:53] together.
[1:28:56] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:28:58] said, "And then I will commune with you
[1:29:02] from above the masses
[1:29:05] and from between the two cherab
[1:29:12] praise the name of our lord." So there
[1:29:15] has to be communion.
[1:29:18] He said, "I will come.
[1:29:21] I meet you." The way he met Abraham and
[1:29:25] then he talked with Abraham and then
[1:29:28] Abraham knew the mind of God.
[1:29:31] That should be our lives every other
[1:29:33] day.
[1:29:34] Praise the name of our Lord every day.
[1:29:37] You know you delight to commune with
[1:29:39] God. You to talk to God. You to hear
[1:29:42] what the Lord is telling.
[1:29:45] should be a life that we live
[1:29:48] not only on church on Sunday on
[1:29:51] Wednesday
[1:29:52] not only that but even at my place of
[1:29:55] work I should be in constant communion
[1:29:58] with the Lord
[1:30:01] when I'm talking to somebody
[1:30:04] and when I'm talking to them they look
[1:30:06] at somebody different
[1:30:10] when I say yes
[1:30:12] I mean Yes.
[1:30:14] But some of these places,
[1:30:17] places of work, he says yes,
[1:30:21] meaning no.
[1:30:23] He says this meaning
[1:30:31] I should not be like that.
[1:30:34] If I've been employed to be at the
[1:30:36] reception,
[1:30:41] let me do my job diligently.
[1:30:45] Receive the people with respect
[1:30:49] and then guide them properly.
[1:30:52] Don't just
[1:31:00] do everything diligently.
[1:31:03] And then people will have a testimony.
[1:31:07] Praise the name of our Lord. If maybe
[1:31:09] I'm a physician,
[1:31:12] you know, be diligent.
[1:31:15] Do the best you can.
[1:31:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Whatever
[1:31:19] work God has put us in,
[1:31:22] be faithful in that kind of work,
[1:31:25] praise the name of our Lord. So, we need
[1:31:27] to see that we do what is right before
[1:31:30] God.
[1:31:32] So God told Moses,
[1:31:34] I will meet with you and commune with
[1:31:37] you from above the mercy seat.
[1:31:43] Now this is very interesting.
[1:31:45] So communion
[1:31:48] he says I'll meet with you
[1:31:51] and then when I meet with you I will
[1:31:53] talk with you from where the masses sit.
[1:31:59] You should look what at as a privilege.
[1:32:03] I'm going to meet my maker. I'm going to
[1:32:06] meet my Lord. I want to talk to him. How
[1:32:10] how can I take long without praying?
[1:32:13] How can I take long without reading
[1:32:15] this?
[1:32:17] Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you
[1:32:19] really love somebody,
[1:32:22] your your mind is taken into him.
[1:32:26] You know your time is taken into him.
[1:32:30] You know, you just want to know more
[1:32:31] about one another.
[1:32:34] When you get a call, you know, you even
[1:32:37] start smiling,
[1:32:40] you know, because you just longing.
[1:32:44] That should be the same thing with the
[1:32:45] Lord.
[1:32:47] Not a burden.
[1:32:49] I don't again
[1:32:52] the whole day
[1:32:56] I have no time to wash my clothes
[1:32:59] have no time to visit.
[1:33:03] Now we have I mean we have football in
[1:33:07] the afternoon
[1:33:09] and I wanted to see that match.
[1:33:14] So you want to commune with football?
[1:33:19] You want to commune with different
[1:33:20] things
[1:33:22] but the privilege that Lord has given
[1:33:24] unto us
[1:33:25] that commune with me above the mercy
[1:33:29] seat.
[1:33:31] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:33:33] when you do that,
[1:33:35] I will tell you what you need to do
[1:33:39] because the Lord knows the end from the
[1:33:41] beginning.
[1:33:45] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:33:47] to see that communion
[1:33:50] is not a one time thing
[1:33:54] but something that we are in
[1:33:55] continuously
[1:33:59] praise the name of our God. I want to
[1:34:00] pick up this message.
[1:34:04] In the message communion,
[1:34:06] brother Brandham says,
[1:34:14] "And in other words, the father sent me
[1:34:19] and I live by him.
[1:34:21] And every man that comes to Christ
[1:34:26] must live by Christ.
[1:34:30] Oh my, there you are.
[1:34:33] That is the communion.
[1:34:36] That's the real communion
[1:34:39] that you find when you live by Christ.
[1:34:45] Now, our bodies need food
[1:34:50] and drink each day to survive. our
[1:34:54] physical body. If we don't take food
[1:34:58] each day and drink,
[1:35:01] then our body weakens.
[1:35:05] There is something in us
[1:35:08] that we must have food.
[1:35:11] One day's food
[1:35:14] will not last the next day.
[1:35:18] You've got to have food each day
[1:35:22] to strengthen your mortal body.
[1:35:26] You can live over
[1:35:32] but you become weaker. And the second
[1:35:35] day still weaker. The third day you are
[1:35:39] getting tremendously weak.
[1:35:44] Then he says,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; "Well, that's what many times
[1:35:50] we do in the spiritual realm."
[1:35:55] Just imagine how often
[1:35:58] you think about God.
[1:36:00] How often you think about the word of
[1:36:03] God?
[1:36:05] Praise the name of our God. only on
[1:36:08] Sunday
[1:36:10] then Monday
[1:36:12] you even don't know whether God is
[1:36:13] there.
[1:36:15] It's just not in your mind
[1:36:18] even in your language.
[1:36:20] Somebody calls you God bless you.
[1:36:25] How are you?
[1:36:28] Even responding God bless you too
[1:36:33] because you are surrounded with
[1:36:35] darkness.
[1:36:38] Maybe you in the market.
[1:36:42] You don't want them to know that you're
[1:36:43] Christian.
[1:36:47] God bless you.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; What do you commune with?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; You are afraid
[1:36:55] to confess him before men.
[1:37:02] Praise the Lord. Now people don't have
[1:37:04] hope.
[1:37:06] People who don't have hope,
[1:37:08] they are proud to show who they are.
[1:37:12] They are proud.
[1:37:14] Some of these people worship men and
[1:37:16] they put the men on their t-shirts
[1:37:20] on their
[1:37:22] even happy to tell you about them.
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:27] But we will talk about the Lord.
[1:37:31] Praise the name of God.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; So you are afraid.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; How weak are you?
[1:37:39] You are afraid. Talk about God.
[1:37:44] You are afraid to show people you are
[1:37:46] carrying a Bible.
[1:37:49] Mine is on the phone.
[1:37:53] Or if you have one, you want to cover it
[1:37:56] and disguise it.
[1:38:02] You are afraid.
[1:38:04] You are afraid to walk with people who
[1:38:07] confess his name.
[1:38:11] You just don't want to identify yourself
[1:38:16] or when you are coming to church
[1:38:19] and you in a tax,
[1:38:23] you put me there to
[1:38:26] you put me in front. You don't want them
[1:38:28] to see that you are coming.
[1:38:32] You're afraid.
[1:38:34] How weak are you?
[1:38:37] Praise the name of But these are demons
[1:38:39] that told us.
[1:38:42] So you are afraid.
[1:38:46] I'm going to church. You know, you tell
[1:38:48] them.
[1:38:49] Praise the name of I'm born again.
[1:38:56] Don't be shy about that.
[1:39:00] But now you are weak
[1:39:02] even to confess
[1:39:05] as if they are stifling your throat.
[1:39:09] No, you are weak.
[1:39:12] So if you are weak, you need to eat. So
[1:39:16] what do you eat? The word of God. Praise
[1:39:20] the name of our Lord.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Read the word. hear the word, pray about
[1:39:25] it, and then God will give you the
[1:39:27] strength.
[1:39:29] Praise the name of our Lord. So, Brother
[1:39:32] Brandham says here,
[1:39:34] you see, each day,
[1:39:36] we've got to commune with Christ.
[1:39:41] We've got to talk him to to him each
[1:39:43] day.
[1:39:45] We've got to settle it with him each
[1:39:47] day.
[1:39:50] Paul said I die each day.
[1:39:55] See, each day I die yet I live.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Not me,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; but Christ lives in me. Now if you die,
[1:40:08] you need another to live in you
[1:40:12] and that is Christ. So I've died to my
[1:40:14] thoughts,
[1:40:17] to my evil friends.
[1:40:20] to bad places.
[1:40:24] If there was a seat at a joint for you,
[1:40:31] they said that one you died.
[1:40:35] So you don't exist there,
[1:40:38] but there is somewhere where you are
[1:40:39] alive.
[1:40:41] Praise the name of somewhere where you
[1:40:44] are alive.
[1:40:46] When brother Brham was talking to some
[1:40:47] of his friends
[1:40:49] and then he said for you don't like
[1:40:51] smoking
[1:40:52] you don't like drinking you don't like
[1:40:54] going for night
[1:40:58] what do you like said I like being in
[1:41:01] church for
[1:41:04] praise the name of our lord it's
[1:41:06] something which should have a passion in
[1:41:07] your life
[1:41:09] you know I like taking my time
[1:41:12] when I get my phone I'm I'm not on naked
[1:41:15] women.
[1:41:17] No, I'm on the things that build me
[1:41:20] spiritually.
[1:41:22] I'm not on secular music.
[1:41:26] When you put on those earphones,
[1:41:30] then you are just on secular music.
[1:41:36] Oh, praise the name of I'm just hearing
[1:41:40] the word.
[1:41:41] I put them on. I'm I'm I'm kind of
[1:41:45] hearing again the sermon we had
[1:41:47] yesterday.
[1:41:49] I'm hearing the things of the Lord. I'm
[1:41:52] hearing the prophet speak to me. There
[1:41:55] is something that keeps on building in
[1:41:57] you. So he says we need to commune with
[1:42:00] Christ.
[1:42:03] So your physical body
[1:42:06] needs food for each day
[1:42:09] and drink each day to survive. your
[1:42:13] spiritual body. You need spiritual food
[1:42:18] and communion
[1:42:20] with the Lord each day to survive.
[1:42:25] Praise the name of our Lord. I just love
[1:42:28] that. I wish we can live like that
[1:42:32] tomorrow. I'm just feeding on the Lord.
[1:42:35] I'm communing with the Lord. I'm praying
[1:42:37] with the Lord. Praise the name of our
[1:42:39] Lord. Tuesday, I'm doing the same.
[1:42:42] Unless I'm doing the same in the
[1:42:45] afternoon on Wednesday, my mind is tuned
[1:42:48] to church. Then I just come to church.
[1:42:51] Praise the name of our Lord. I want to
[1:42:53] get a refilling.
[1:42:55] Praise the name of our Lord. I go back
[1:42:59] and you know when the troubles come, you
[1:43:02] have faith to pray.
[1:43:04] Say, Lord, this is the trouble. Then you
[1:43:06] believe you see the Lord move.
[1:43:10] But now if you are afraid to even
[1:43:12] confess God
[1:43:15] and then trouble come in the evening,
[1:43:18] you'll be like the other people without
[1:43:20] Christ.
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:28] You are crying like those without.
[1:43:32] If you have God, the Lord intervene in
[1:43:35] this kind
[1:43:38] of you commune with him.
[1:43:42] You can say okay in my night praying
[1:43:47] and intercession.
[1:43:49] I'm going to bring this before the Lord.
[1:43:51] Lord, there is this issue. Lord, may you
[1:43:54] intervene. Lord, may you guide. You are
[1:43:57] communing.
[1:43:59] So you're not there waiting.
[1:44:02] I don't know when Wednesday will come. I
[1:44:04] don't know when Sunday will come. But
[1:44:07] right there, that same day, you present
[1:44:10] your petition
[1:44:12] before the Lord because you commune with
[1:44:15] him.
[1:44:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Like,
[1:44:18] brother Brandham gives a testimony
[1:44:21] about that woman who prayed until the
[1:44:25] plane was stopped.
[1:44:31] She had a son and the son had gone into
[1:44:34] immoral living
[1:44:38] but she loved God
[1:44:40] and you know she started you know her
[1:44:42] life she was always communing with God
[1:44:46] said you're the one who gave me this son
[1:44:49] now I'm trying to show him the
[1:44:51] he rebellious until he get himself into
[1:44:55] social acts
[1:44:57] and then he does things which are bad
[1:45:00] until he got some venerial disease
[1:45:06] and it was killing him
[1:45:10] and then she kept on pleading.
[1:45:14] You had a a widow woman like me
[1:45:18] a prophet Lord where is my prophet
[1:45:22] Elijah
[1:45:24] you can send that you know she was
[1:45:26] communing so she was able to know the
[1:45:29] right word
[1:45:31] to apply in a particular stra
[1:45:35] of lord you must know the right word
[1:45:39] what you know appears like mine in the
[1:45:42] bible
[1:45:45] Why has God, you know, allowed this to
[1:45:47] happen?
[1:45:48] Why does the Lord want me to do this
[1:45:50] kind of stuff?
[1:45:52] So, she kept on communing with the Lord
[1:45:55] until she dreamt in the night. And a
[1:45:58] voice told her, go and stand at the door
[1:46:03] outside your gate.
[1:46:05] I'm sending my prophet is dressed like
[1:46:08] this.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Allah. She knew how
[1:46:13] to commune
[1:46:15] and the Lord was there to answer her
[1:46:17] back.
[1:46:18] She speaks. The Lord speaks. She speaks.
[1:46:22] The Lord speaks. That should be our life
[1:46:24] every other day. In continuous
[1:46:27] communion,
[1:46:29] praise the name of our Lord. You commune
[1:46:31] with God.
[1:46:33] But say Lord there is this issue
[1:46:36] like Rebecca
[1:46:38] when the children were fighting in her
[1:46:39] womb
[1:46:41] she communed with God. Say Lord why is
[1:46:44] this happening to me? Then the Lord
[1:46:46] talked back
[1:46:48] that one there are two nations in your
[1:46:50] way.
[1:46:52] The younger
[1:46:53] shall fight the elder
[1:46:56] and will do better than the elder.
[1:46:59] you know knowing from the Lord.
[1:47:02] So we need to be in continuous
[1:47:04] communion.
[1:47:07] Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[1:47:09] brother Brennham he said let me go and
[1:47:11] post my mail
[1:47:17] and because he saw the time is there
[1:47:20] and then when he went to post the mail
[1:47:23] in post office the voice told him walk.
[1:47:28] He said okay. He started walking turn
[1:47:32] this way and he was walking this way
[1:47:36] this way. So he was passing by and the
[1:47:39] woman told him
[1:47:43] said hey how did you know me?
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of he said I saw you.
[1:47:50] Now you can imagine God didn't reveal to
[1:47:52] the prophet
[1:47:56] but revealed to the woman
[1:47:58] her prayers her communion with God
[1:48:02] brought the prophet of God to her home.
[1:48:05] Praise the name of our Lord. And brother
[1:48:07] Brandham, when he entered the home, then
[1:48:10] she told the prophet, you know, I'm like
[1:48:13] this woman in the Bible. I pray to God.
[1:48:16] You told me you are coming and did you
[1:48:18] come and I have my child to pray for
[1:48:22] then told her you pray.
[1:48:27] And he said, if there is somebody who
[1:48:29] knows how to talk to God,
[1:48:32] the other woman knew the God she was
[1:48:33] talking.
[1:48:40] No, she knew who she was talking.
[1:48:45] That's a personal relationship.
[1:48:48] That's how we should have with God.
[1:48:51] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:48:53] we should have with God.
[1:48:55] When church delays
[1:49:05] when you're when you're meeting an
[1:49:06] important person
[1:49:11] say ah today we have even more time
[1:49:17] you know he talked I talked he talked I
[1:49:21] talked he talked I talked praise the
[1:49:24] name of the Lord That's communion.
[1:49:27] But if it is only one hour, one one
[1:49:29] minute prayer.
[1:49:32] You are afraid of the night.
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:39] I don't know what is going to happen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Then you are yawning.
[1:49:44] Sleep is disturbing you.
[1:49:47] Amen. Amen. What kind of communion is
[1:49:50] that?
[1:49:53] It's just like you go to somebody in
[1:49:55] their office.
[1:49:57] He's seated there.
[1:50:00] He's talking with you.
[1:50:05] Uhhuh.
[1:50:09] How do you commune?
[1:50:11] Just like sometimes at home the wife is
[1:50:14] talking, the husband is in his
[1:50:17] newspapers.
[1:50:22] What are you saying?
[1:50:24] What kind of communion?
[1:50:27] So you need to go with all your mind
[1:50:31] time is given to
[1:50:34] and then you able to hear what he tells.
[1:50:38] Praise the name of our Lord. That kind
[1:50:40] of communion.
[1:50:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[1:50:45] says
[1:50:48] we need
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; to commune with the Lord each day
[1:50:54] to survive.
[1:50:56] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:50:59] alone
[1:51:02] but by every word
[1:51:05] that proceeds out of the mouth.
[1:51:08] So each day we've got to study the
[1:51:12] Bible.
[1:51:14] Each day,
[1:51:16] praise the name of
[1:51:23] you know my phone.
[1:51:26] So you
[1:51:29] let me read only one verse.
[1:51:32] Amen. Is that what
[1:51:36] just reviewing flash?
[1:51:41] You know take time
[1:51:44] study
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; and to study means
[1:51:47] even doing cross reference.
[1:51:52] Yeah. Jesus said about this. The other
[1:51:54] day we were being told about this.
[1:51:57] Yeah. this. Now if Paul says like this
[1:52:02] where is it in the Old Testament
[1:52:04] go back and try to find there
[1:52:07] you are studying
[1:52:10] praise the name of you are taking time
[1:52:12] into it.
[1:52:16] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:52:18] said some people doesn't study it at
[1:52:21] all.
[1:52:23] Some pick it up every two or three times
[1:52:26] a year.
[1:52:29] But a real believer
[1:52:32] that is spiritually built up,
[1:52:36] he reads his Bible every day
[1:52:40] and talks to the Lord.
[1:52:42] That is right. He has to. Man shall not
[1:52:47] live by bread,
[1:52:49] but by every word
[1:52:52] that proceeds out of the mouth.
[1:52:55] In other words, the father sent me and I
[1:52:59] live by him.
[1:53:02] And every man that comes to Christ
[1:53:06] must live by Christ.
[1:53:09] That's very interesting. You come to
[1:53:12] Christ. Why don't you live by Christ?
[1:53:15] And then he says,
[1:53:18] if you do that, there you are.
[1:53:22] That is the communion.
[1:53:25] You are living by Christ.
[1:53:28] That's the real communion
[1:53:31] that you find
[1:53:33] when you live by Christ.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the same message. I'm
[1:53:40] not anywhere.
[1:53:42] Paragraph.
[1:53:46] Praise the name of our Lord. He said
[1:53:49] that's what it is.
[1:53:53] Okay. Then he says, "Now our bodies need
[1:53:56] food and drink it today.
[1:54:01] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:54:03] live by Christ.
[1:54:07] Every day I live by Christ." And that's
[1:54:11] what God was telling Moses.
[1:54:13] There I will meet you on top of the
[1:54:15] masses seat
[1:54:17] and I will commune with you.
[1:54:20] Praise the name of God.
[1:54:22] true communion,
[1:54:24] not false communion,
[1:54:27] not communion with devils,
[1:54:31] but communion
[1:54:33] based on the word of God.
[1:54:36] Praise the name of our Lord. A
[1:54:38] communion,
[1:54:40] fellowship,
[1:54:41] you know, something that you are into
[1:54:44] it,
[1:54:47] you've got yourself into it.
[1:54:50] Like the Bible says here in 2
[1:54:53] Corinthians
[1:54:56] and then verse 13, chapter 13 and verse
[1:54:59] 14,
[1:55:02] the Bible says,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:55:08] the love of God and the communion of the
[1:55:11] Holy Ghost be with you all." Amen.
[1:55:25] He says the grace of the Lord,
[1:55:29] the grace of God has brought salvation
[1:55:32] to us.
[1:55:34] And when salvation comes to us, it
[1:55:38] brings that love of God.
[1:55:41] And the love of God
[1:55:44] like husband and wife. When the man
[1:55:47] loves the wife,
[1:55:50] what comes next? Communion.
[1:55:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Communion.
[1:55:57] The man showed the grace
[1:56:01] picked the wife.
[1:56:04] Like when you marry, you've taken
[1:56:06] somebody's daughter.
[1:56:10] The leadership has been taken from the
[1:56:13] father to the husband.
[1:56:20] As a husband,
[1:56:21] you have to show that you love your wife
[1:56:25] even more than the parents.
[1:56:28] Praise the name of Yeah, you have to do
[1:56:30] that.
[1:56:33] You love her.
[1:56:35] You cherish her.
[1:56:42] Praise the name of our
[1:56:58] silus is in the class.
[1:57:05] You know, you just cherish her the way
[1:57:09] you cherish your body. The way you don't
[1:57:12] make your body go hungry.
[1:57:15] You see that you you bring you because
[1:57:18] you she had favor before you
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:24] then you loved her. Now it is communion.
[1:57:30] But now some people
[1:57:33] they tend to be loving outside here.
[1:57:37] But when you go into their house,
[1:57:40] no communion,
[1:57:43] no communion,
[1:57:46] there's somebody
[1:57:48] got a wife.
[1:57:50] Then the best place to put the wife
[1:58:02] and let me put my wife in the village to
[1:58:04] cultivate the land. That was not the
[1:58:06] purpose of marriage.
[1:58:09] He said Adam was lonely.
[1:58:15] How how can you solve loness by one
[1:58:17] being in kal and another being in
[1:58:25] how
[1:58:28] no communion
[1:58:30] that should not be our lives.
[1:58:32] Praise the name of our lord. So now the
[1:58:34] Bible is telling us the grace of our
[1:58:37] Lord Jesus
[1:58:39] and that grace of God
[1:58:42] that God has shown to us, it puts the
[1:58:45] love of God,
[1:58:48] God himself in you. And when you have
[1:58:51] true love of God,
[1:58:54] always be in communion
[1:58:57] with the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:59] That should be our desire. Lord, I want
[1:59:02] to be in continuous communion
[1:59:05] with the Holy Spirit. The Bible says in
[1:59:08] Romans chapter 8
[1:59:11] that as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:59:14] God,
[1:59:16] they are the children of God.
[1:59:18] So you are you have died to yourself.
[1:59:22] The Holy Ghost has taken over your life.
[1:59:25] Until you are always depending on God,
[1:59:28] you rise up. Lord, I'm here. Lead me,
[1:59:32] Lord. Guide me, Lord. Direct me, Lord.
[1:59:36] You are completely depending upon God,
[1:59:41] the communion of the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:43] Praise the name of that kind of
[1:59:46] intimacy,
[1:59:53] praise the name of the communion of the
[1:59:55] Holy Spirit.
[1:59:57] So, the Bible says, Our human spirit
[2:00:02] together with the Holy Spirit
[2:00:05] have a testimony
[2:00:07] that we are the sons of God.
[2:00:10] We are the children of God. Praise the
[2:00:13] name of our Lord. That's the communion
[2:00:14] of the Holy Spirit. Your whole life
[2:00:19] given it over to God. That's the
[2:00:21] communion.
[2:00:24] So the word of God is not far from you.
[2:00:27] The presence of God is not far from you,
[2:00:30] but the Lord is always with you because
[2:00:33] you are communing.
[2:00:35] In the Old Testament, the master seat
[2:00:38] was a place.
[2:00:40] But now in the New Testament, when you
[2:00:43] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[2:00:46] your heart becomes the master seat. So
[2:00:49] he wants to commune with you
[2:00:51] continuously
[2:00:53] right from inside within you
[2:00:56] talking with you communing with you even
[2:01:00] at your place of work communing with you
[2:01:03] even in your garden he's communing with
[2:01:06] you even you know in your businesses
[2:01:09] he's communing with you even in class
[2:01:12] he's communing with you praise the name
[2:01:15] of the Lord the communion of the Holy
[2:01:17] Spirit and the communion of the Holy
[2:01:20] Spirit.
[2:01:21] You avoid things that grieve the Holy
[2:01:24] Spirit.
[2:01:27] What are the things that can affect our
[2:01:29] communion with the Holy Spirit?
[2:01:33] Let us go to Ephesians 4.
[2:01:37] And then verse 30,
[2:01:40] praise the name of our Lord. Ephesians
[2:01:43] 4:30.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[2:01:55] Let us start from verse
[2:01:57] 29.
[2:02:01] Okay, we can pick it from behind here.
[2:02:04] Let us start from verse
[2:02:09] 24.
[2:02:11] He says,
[2:02:14] "And that you put on the new man
[2:02:20] new man,
[2:02:22] new creation.
[2:02:25] Now, when you accept the Lord Jesus as
[2:02:27] your personal savior,
[2:02:30] why would you stop along the way?
[2:02:33] Why don't you desire?
[2:02:35] Lord, make me new.
[2:02:38] Lord, fill me with your Holy
[2:02:42] Lord. Live in my life.
[2:02:45] That's communion. You you allow him to
[2:02:48] make you new,
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; which after God is created in
[2:02:55] righteousness and true holiness.
[2:03:04] So the new man
[2:03:06] the Bible says you know is after God
[2:03:13] righteousness
[2:03:15] and holiness. So your mind
[2:03:19] is always about righteousness
[2:03:22] about holiness of God.
[2:03:25] Even your speech,
[2:03:27] you no longer have dirty words coming.
[2:03:32] You don't rejoice in being in those that
[2:03:33] place.
[2:03:35] You know, you want things that are
[2:03:37] glorifying to
[2:03:40] that, you know, establish you before the
[2:03:42] Lord,
[2:03:44] praise the name of Lord. Then he said,
[2:03:47] wherefore putting away lying.
[2:03:53] So if you know you lie
[2:03:56] say Lord I no longer want to lie
[2:04:00] but the whole day
[2:04:02] there is a lie you've told
[2:04:07] if you don't lie you can't survive. No
[2:04:10] that's in the darkness now but in the
[2:04:13] light but we're lying
[2:04:18] now you start preparing statements when
[2:04:19] you're going to meet somebody.
[2:04:24] If he says like this, if he says this, I
[2:04:27] would do this. Where is the new man now?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; In you said, put away lying.
[2:04:36] Then he says, speak every man truth with
[2:04:40] his neighbor,
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:45] for we are members one of another.
[2:04:52] Be ye angry and sin not.
[2:05:00] Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.
[2:05:07] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[2:05:09] when you are angry
[2:05:13] don't do evil
[2:05:17] slap.
[2:05:18] Ghana,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; then you know that the anger has gone
[2:05:21] beyond now.
[2:05:23] And then he says
[2:05:26] when the sun is going down
[2:05:30] that anger should be away from you
[2:05:33] but now yesterday you are angry
[2:05:36] then even today you are holding anger
[2:05:40] something in you.
[2:05:43] No
[2:05:44] is the new man.
[2:05:47] What communion is that?
[2:05:51] Be angry,
[2:05:54] but don't let the sun go over your
[2:05:56] anger.
[2:05:59] Praise the name of our Lord. Communion.
[2:06:04] So you shouldn't allow anger be there.
[2:06:08] The thing was done last year,
[2:06:12] but you are still hurt and you feel that
[2:06:14] person there.
[2:06:19] from that day. I'm so angry with you.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Did you die to yourself?
[2:06:28] Did you
[2:06:30] resurrect that which died
[2:06:34] away from you
[2:06:36] praise the name of our Lord? He said,
[2:06:38] "Don't sin."
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:42] Then the Bible says neither give place
[2:06:44] to the devil
[2:06:49] let him that stall still no more
[2:06:55] but rather let him labor
[2:07:00] working with his hands
[2:07:05] the thing which is good
[2:07:10] that he may be able to give him that
[2:07:13] needeth.
[2:07:18] Praise the name of Lord. Let no corrupt
[2:07:21] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; but that which is good
[2:07:31] to the use of edifying
[2:07:38] that it may minister grace unto the
[2:07:41] hearers.
[2:07:47] Then verse 30
[2:07:50] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[2:07:55] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[2:07:58] redemption.
[2:08:03] So you have the Holy Spirit in you
[2:08:06] and brings communion.
[2:08:09] Then he says don't grieve that Holy
[2:08:12] Spirit.
[2:08:14] How do you grieve the Holy Spirit?
[2:08:17] By doing things contrary to the word of
[2:08:20] God,
[2:08:22] you are grieving the Holy Spirit. And
[2:08:25] when you grieve the Holy Spirit, you are
[2:08:27] affecting your communion.
[2:08:31] You are affecting your communion.
[2:08:34] And so you'll find yourself a lot
[2:08:36] burdened,
[2:08:40] weak spiritually,
[2:08:43] even coming to church.
[2:08:45] It's a trouble coming to church. You
[2:08:48] have many excuses.
[2:08:50] You'll always have a reason of not
[2:08:52] coming to church.
[2:08:54] You'll always have a reason of not
[2:08:56] reading your Bible.
[2:08:58] You'll always have a reason,
[2:09:01] of not praying.
[2:09:04] Why? Because you have grieved the Holy
[2:09:06] Spirit.
[2:09:07] The Holy Spirit is not there.
[2:09:10] And yet in our Christian life, we need
[2:09:13] the Holy Spirit
[2:09:15] all the time in our life.
[2:09:18] Because the Bible says that the Holy
[2:09:21] Spirit is our earnest
[2:09:26] down payment.
[2:09:29] It's what proves that you are really
[2:09:30] born again.
[2:09:33] It's what proves that you are really a
[2:09:34] new man.
[2:09:36] It's what proves that you're not of the
[2:09:38] world.
[2:09:40] That's the Holy Spirit. Now, if you
[2:09:42] don't have the Holy Spirit, how are you
[2:09:44] going to be a Christian?
[2:09:46] You can't. You need the Holy Spirit
[2:09:50] in your life to give you the strength
[2:09:54] to give you the power
[2:09:57] to live the life of Christ.
[2:10:00] To overcome these demons, you need the
[2:10:03] Holy Spirit without the Holy Spirit.
[2:10:07] You can't go farther.
[2:10:09] How do you overcome your weaknesses? Or
[2:10:11] when you fall, how do you rise up
[2:10:15] without the Holy Spirit? When the Bible
[2:10:17] says that the Holy Spirit helps our
[2:10:21] infirmities
[2:10:23] but you know the one who supports you
[2:10:27] are decompaining him
[2:10:30] you have grieved him
[2:10:33] then what happens
[2:10:36] like sometimes when you are in the
[2:10:38] neighborhood
[2:10:40] you don't have money there is a shop you
[2:10:42] go to buy things from
[2:10:46] you don't have money and you know that's
[2:10:49] where you need to pick things
[2:10:53] up
[2:10:55] but all night talking
[2:10:58] but you don't have food at home
[2:11:01] you don't have money that's the only
[2:11:10] but that's what we do you You need the
[2:11:13] Holy Spirit to help you in your
[2:11:15] weaknesses
[2:11:18] but the one you areing
[2:11:22] putting off
[2:11:25] but he needs help in your weakness.
[2:11:29] He needs help in your prayers.
[2:11:31] The Bible says women don't know how to
[2:11:33] pray but the Holy Spirit in us
[2:11:37] seed because he knows the mind of God.
[2:11:42] that you have grieved the Holy Spirit.
[2:11:45] No more communion now
[2:11:47] because he's not there. He's grieved
[2:11:52] is grief.
[2:11:54] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[2:11:56] says, "Let us not grieve the Holy
[2:11:58] Spirit." How do you grieve the Holy
[2:12:01] Spirit?
[2:12:02] Verse 31,
[2:12:04] let all of bitterness,
[2:12:09] not some,
[2:12:12] bitterness.
[2:12:14] Let that root be go away from us.
[2:12:18] Wrath,
[2:12:20] anger,
[2:12:23] clamor,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; and you see these spirits, if they come
[2:12:32] to your home,
[2:12:36] if you get a visitor,
[2:12:39] they just want to leave immediately,
[2:12:42] you get trouble because those are the
[2:12:43] spirits hanging around.
[2:12:46] There is this chair has a spirit of
[2:12:47] anger.
[2:12:51] This one has a spirit of bitterness.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Every chair has a spirit.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And then you sit in one of those chairs.
[2:13:07] There are some of those homes like that.
[2:13:11] When is the day going to end?
[2:13:16] Take away these spirits away from your
[2:13:18] home.
[2:13:20] Somebody is talking to their child
[2:13:25] but they are shouting
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; clammer.
[2:13:30] The child is there before you.
[2:13:39] Some of these are our homes.
[2:13:43] Demons have taken over.
[2:13:46] There is no communion of the Holy Spirit
[2:13:49] because you already grieve the Holy
[2:13:50] Spirit.
[2:13:53] Rush.
[2:13:56] The child has made a smaller mistake.
[2:13:59] But even start shaking the body.
[2:14:06] No communion of the Holy Spirit.
[2:14:10] Bitterness alone.
[2:14:17] hotter than
[2:14:24] you know there are some people when they
[2:14:25] are made the eyes are red they say
[2:14:30] is not attractive at all
[2:14:34] you can't have communion of the holy
[2:14:36] spirit in that
[2:14:38] then the bible says
[2:14:40] evil speaking
[2:14:46] The other one can bring a word
[2:14:52] that I'm small but the words that
[2:14:54] proceed out of me.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible say
[2:14:58] that tongue
[2:15:03] is
[2:15:05] but can be too long.
[2:15:09] You know there are example when they are
[2:15:10] quarreling even when they are leaving
[2:15:12] they are quarreling.
[2:15:24] No communion there.
[2:15:28] Those are demons.
[2:15:30] So you cannot have fellowship with the
[2:15:32] Holy Spir
[2:15:34] but imagine living in that house
[2:15:38] demons there
[2:15:40] demons can come by one person.
[2:15:45] And now when you start also
[2:15:47] fellowshipping or communing with that
[2:15:48] person
[2:15:58] you despising and then you see all the
[2:16:01] kids have taken the same
[2:16:06] and now these are challenges for people
[2:16:08] who don't keep their children.
[2:16:12] You get this made from there
[2:16:16] She may be maybe maybe the the root of
[2:16:18] bitterness.
[2:16:20] She come with the demon.
[2:16:23] The other one evil speaking.
[2:16:28] They know every funny thing there is
[2:16:32] your children will learn from them.
[2:16:35] And you don't have time to fellowship
[2:16:36] with your children.
[2:16:38] You don't know where the danger is
[2:16:39] coming.
[2:16:41] This one has come with this demon.
[2:16:44] Next month another one comes with
[2:16:45] another demon and those demons keep
[2:16:48] there.
[2:16:51] You don't pray,
[2:16:54] you don't read the word, you don't take
[2:16:57] time to fellowship,
[2:16:59] they always there,
[2:17:03] no communion.
[2:17:06] Then the Bible says
[2:17:08] and marries.
[2:17:14] How you look at all these demons,
[2:17:23] evil speaking,
[2:17:26] bitterness,
[2:17:28] malice.
[2:17:33] They don't end there. One demon can
[2:17:35] bring this, the other one can bring
[2:17:36] this.
[2:17:38] But the Bible says, "Be kind one to
[2:17:41] another,
[2:17:45] tenderhearted,
[2:17:48] forgiving one another,
[2:17:50] even as God for Christ's sake
[2:17:55] has forgiven you."
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:17:59] praise the name of our Lord.
[2:18:02] Most of the things we shall do, we shall
[2:18:04] talk about them in the afternoon about
[2:18:06] the Lord's table.
[2:18:09] It's difficult to get into that line.
[2:18:12] But let us talk about our dayto-day
[2:18:14] living
[2:18:17] communion.
[2:18:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, there
[2:18:22] is a problem.
[2:18:25] If you don't want to forgive,
[2:18:30] he said forgiving one another.
[2:18:34] If you don't forgive,
[2:18:36] even the Lord will not hear your
[2:18:38] prayers.
[2:18:42] That's what the Bible says. Let us go to
[2:18:45] Markapter 11.
[2:18:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Mark
[2:18:51] chapter 11.
[2:18:57] And then we read in verse
[2:19:05] verse 25.
[2:19:08] And when you stand praying, forgive.
[2:19:15] If you have ought against any,
[2:19:21] that your father also which is in heaven
[2:19:23] may forgive you your trespasses.
[2:19:29] So if you don't forgive,
[2:19:32] you are not also forgiven.
[2:19:36] That's the scripture.
[2:19:38] So if you don't forgive,
[2:19:41] you grieve the Holy Spirit.
[2:19:45] So you cannot have communion with the
[2:19:46] Holy Spirit.
[2:19:49] So the Bible says in verse 26,
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; if you do not forgive,
[2:19:56] neither will your father which is in
[2:19:58] heaven forgive your trespasses.
[2:20:06] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[2:20:09] to forgive.
[2:20:12] If you don't forgive,
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; you're also not forgiven.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; And if you don't forgive,
[2:20:21] the Bible says,
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; you are subjected to tormentors
[2:20:29] and tormentors
[2:20:31] are demons.
[2:20:36] Actually, when you don't forgive, you
[2:20:38] under torment.
[2:20:44] you're the one under torment. You don't
[2:20:47] forgive
[2:20:49] you are under torment.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; So if you want to be healed from that
[2:20:54] forgive
[2:20:55] and those demons
[2:20:58] torment all the time that thing is
[2:21:00] aching you
[2:21:03] and some of these things can bring
[2:21:04] diseases.
[2:21:08] You want to go to the grave without
[2:21:09] forgiving.
[2:21:18] So we need to see that we avoid all
[2:21:20] those kind of areas.
[2:21:24] Praise the name of our lord. Now briefly
[2:21:26] let us introduce
[2:21:28] in the message communion.
[2:21:31] Brother Brandham says,
[2:21:33] "Now I do believe that communion,
[2:21:37] what we call communion,
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; is the Lord's supper.
[2:21:43] Now we have only three physical divine
[2:21:46] orders left to us.
[2:21:54] One of them is communion,
[2:21:58] foot washing,
[2:22:00] water baptism.
[2:22:02] That's the only three things
[2:22:06] that he has told us to do.
[2:22:10] There's foot washing
[2:22:13] which we want to do this after this
[2:22:14] evening
[2:22:16] and then the Lord is tell.
[2:22:19] And then because there are three things
[2:22:20] you do physically.
[2:22:23] The first is water baptism.
[2:22:26] You sure love to go into the water.
[2:22:29] You be baptized in the name of Jesus.
[2:22:31] And now that baptism, you only do it
[2:22:34] once.
[2:22:36] If it is true,
[2:22:38] but now when it comes to communion,
[2:22:42] the Lord is stable.
[2:22:44] The Bible says as often as you would
[2:22:50] and foot washing
[2:22:52] as often as you would.
[2:22:55] Now in the brand tabernacle
[2:22:58] they were doing it once every month
[2:23:03] at the beginning of every month
[2:23:06] like the first Sunday of the month
[2:23:08] they would do it and we are trying so to
[2:23:11] do the same thing.
[2:23:13] Every person of the month in the
[2:23:16] evening, we do the best we can to
[2:23:18] observe.
[2:23:20] Now, these are commandments of God.
[2:23:24] Praise the name of our Lord. These are
[2:23:27] commandments of God.
[2:23:30] In the early church,
[2:23:33] they observed them.
[2:23:35] Now, you see that in the denominations,
[2:23:38] they don't care for them. They can do it
[2:23:41] anyway.
[2:23:43] The Lord's supper they take it as
[2:23:46] breakfast
[2:23:49] but it's a supper.
[2:23:52] So for them even at 8 in the morning
[2:23:59] but it was
[2:24:01] not a morning.
[2:24:04] And then in some denominations
[2:24:06] they get sodas
[2:24:10] cocoa
[2:24:12] then they go and buy tip top
[2:24:15] or some scones
[2:24:17] and they said now they on the lord's
[2:24:18] table
[2:24:20] no
[2:24:23] there is way we have to observe it
[2:24:27] is supper
[2:24:29] so time
[2:24:31] what did they use. Praise the name of
[2:24:34] our Lord. They used unleavened bread.
[2:24:41] So you don't put anything there
[2:24:44] other than mixing the flour with water.
[2:24:49] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:24:53] Christ told us,
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord,
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; that you take the wine
[2:25:01] and that wine represented his blood.
[2:25:08] Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[2:25:10] communion,
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; you will see that it's meedcri
[2:25:20] is the one who started it
[2:25:22] when he met Abraham.
[2:25:25] He gave him wine.
[2:25:27] Praise the name of our Lord. In Genesis
[2:25:30] 14 and verse 17,
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Genesis Genesis 14:17,
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; it says, "And the king of Sodom went out
[2:25:45] to meet him after the return from the
[2:25:47] slaughter of the children and of the
[2:25:50] kings that were with him at the V of
[2:25:52] Shab, which is the king is there.
[2:26:18] And the king of Salem, brought forth
[2:26:21] bread and wine, and was the priest of
[2:26:24] the most high God.
[2:26:34] He brought bread
[2:26:37] unleavened bread
[2:26:40] and wine.
[2:26:42] He was the priest of the high priest.
[2:26:46] He served Abraham.
[2:26:48] Praise the name of our Lord. He started
[2:26:51] communion.
[2:26:53] And we see that the same
[2:26:57] when he put on flesh,
[2:27:00] he also introduced the same.
[2:27:03] Now,
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; so we see when we we shall look that in
[2:27:07] the afternoon
[2:27:09] that in Exodus 12,
[2:27:14] God told them about the Passover.
[2:27:19] And then he told them, you get a lamb
[2:27:24] without blemish.
[2:27:27] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:27:29] you put that lamb,
[2:27:32] you sacrifice it on the 14th day.
[2:27:36] And then you get the blood. And then you
[2:27:38] put it on the door.
[2:27:41] And when the angel is passing there, he
[2:27:45] says, I will pass over that house
[2:27:48] where the dopost has been p where the
[2:27:50] blood has been pou.
[2:27:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Now from
[2:27:56] that day,
[2:27:58] the Lord told them this. You shall do it
[2:28:01] as a memorial.
[2:28:04] So now they would roast the meat
[2:28:08] and then eat that meat.
[2:28:11] So they were killing their Passover.
[2:28:15] It was an animal. So now they did it
[2:28:18] through all the generations
[2:28:22] until when Christ came.
[2:28:26] Praise the name of our Lord on that
[2:28:28] night.
[2:28:30] Praise the name of our Lord because they
[2:28:32] were having it was always called a feast
[2:28:34] of unleaven bread.
[2:28:39] So they would eat the unleaven bread
[2:28:43] with the roasted meat,
[2:28:47] but they wouldn't apply the blood on
[2:28:49] their doorsteps.
[2:28:52] But the life of the flesh
[2:28:56] is in the blood.
[2:28:58] So for them when they were doing this
[2:29:00] thing, they were looking at a sacrifice
[2:29:04] that is to come.
[2:29:06] And then he has Christ stands in the
[2:29:09] junction.
[2:29:11] Praise the name of our Lord.Ced
[2:29:14] wine and and even bread.
[2:29:19] Then Moses brings them the Passover
[2:29:24] that you know he's going to pass over
[2:29:25] you.
[2:29:27] So you are secure. You're not going to
[2:29:28] die.
[2:29:30] Now when Christ stands here,
[2:29:33] he introduces
[2:29:35] and he tells them instead of roasting
[2:29:38] animals,
[2:29:40] praise the name of our Lord because the
[2:29:42] blood was in the animal.
[2:29:46] And he says now this is my blood.
[2:29:50] Praise the name of our Lord. The blood
[2:29:52] of the new testament.
[2:29:55] So when Christ comes, he takes them back
[2:29:58] to me,
[2:30:01] the wine and unleavened bread.
[2:30:05] So they stopped killing animals
[2:30:09] for the Passover.
[2:30:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:30:13] says, "This bread
[2:30:17] is my body.
[2:30:20] This wine
[2:30:22] is my blood. He's identifying
[2:30:27] with what MeredC did in Genesis chapter
[2:30:29] 14
[2:30:31] and saying this is my fulfillment of it.
[2:30:36] He says when you take this blood
[2:30:40] this is the blood of the new testament.
[2:30:44] Praise the name over. It's the blood of
[2:30:47] the New Testament.
[2:30:49] During the Passover,
[2:30:52] they were only killing the animals.
[2:30:55] Praise the name of our Lord. But when
[2:30:57] Christ comes, no more animal killings.
[2:31:02] Because he's the Passover lamb.
[2:31:05] He has that animal they were killing
[2:31:07] every year.
[2:31:11] He said, "I'm the one now."
[2:31:14] But to stand for my blood,
[2:31:17] there is wine here.
[2:31:19] Praise the name of our Lord representing
[2:31:21] the life of Jesus Christ.
[2:31:24] Then the bread
[2:31:27] representing the body
[2:31:29] which is the word of God.
[2:31:32] So it is important for us to be part of
[2:31:35] the Lord's table.
[2:31:38] Praise the name of our Lord and you need
[2:31:41] to be part of it. If you are also in
[2:31:44] communion with God,
[2:31:47] you don't only do it on Sunday.
[2:31:49] You are living a clean life.
[2:31:52] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:31:54] there are people who have excuses.
[2:31:57] When the Lord's supper comes,
[2:32:00] they are busy doing something else. I
[2:32:03] present themselves, have a program.
[2:32:08] Why don't you live right before God?
[2:32:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Why don't
[2:32:13] you live right before God?
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; But then you are dodging. When this time
[2:32:18] comes, that's the time to escape. That's
[2:32:21] the time to dodge.
[2:32:24] It is very important.
[2:32:26] You know Jesus told Peter, if I don't
[2:32:29] wash your feet,
[2:32:32] you are not part of me.
[2:32:34] Praise the name of the Lord. So as God
[2:32:37] gives us opportunity,
[2:32:39] we need to observe the Lord's supper.
[2:32:44] See that you are part of it.
[2:32:46] Brother Brandham was saying when they
[2:32:49] took that Passover in Exodus 12
[2:32:55] for 40 years,
[2:32:58] none of them was sick.
[2:33:00] And said even the Lord's supper,
[2:33:04] you can come when you are sick and
[2:33:05] partake of it
[2:33:07] and you are healed, you are delivered.
[2:33:12] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[2:33:14] for you don't want that.
[2:33:16] Satan keeps you there
[2:33:19] tormenting you, tormenting you,
[2:33:20] tormenting you.
[2:33:23] Now, if the rapture happens today,
[2:33:26] when will you be ready?
[2:33:29] Praise the name of our Lord. But we need
[2:33:31] to live in continuous communion.
[2:33:35] Praise the name of our Lord. I believe
[2:33:37] we shall continue from there in the
[2:33:38] afternoon.
[2:33:40] May God bless you.
[2:33:43] Amen. Let us sing song 140. Redeemed,
[2:33:47] redeemed, th I love to proclaim it.
[2:33:53] After prayers,
[2:33:55] I want the youth to remain. And then we
[2:33:57] talk them for 10 minutes only.
[2:34:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Redeem thou
[2:34:04] I love to proclaim
[2:34:07] me. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; Redeemed through hisite
[2:34:19] mercy.

[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; redeemed.

[2:34:53] I'm so happy redeemed. I'm so happy in
[2:34:58] Jesus.
[2:35:01] No language my rapture can tell.

[2:35:12] presence
[2:35:14] with me does that continually
[2:35:19] redeemed. I'm redeemed.
[2:35:24] [Music]
[2:35:26] Oh, I'm redeemed by the blood of the
[2:35:31] lamb.

[2:35:37] Redeemed
[2:35:40] his child and forever.
[2:35:46] Oh, I think of my blessed redeemer.
[2:35:53] I think of him all the day long.
[2:36:00] I sing for I cannot be silent.
[2:36:06] His love is the theme of my soul.
[2:36:12] Yes, I'm redeemed.
[2:36:17] Redeemed.
[2:36:20] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:36:26] Yes, I'm redeemed.

[2:37:19] Yes, I'm redeemed.

[2:48:45] for the word that has been taught to us
[2:48:47] this morning.
[2:48:51] What a sweet fellowship, Lord.
[2:48:55] A time, Lord, to always have communion
[2:48:58] with thee
[2:49:02] like you told Moses
[2:49:05] that you will commune with him
[2:49:09] right from up on the mercy seat.
[2:49:14] Father, it is our prayer
[2:49:18] that that fellowship,
[2:49:21] that angelic visit
[2:49:25] may never depart from us.
[2:49:29] May never depart from our families,
[2:49:33] may never depart in our workplaces,
[2:49:36] [Music]
[2:49:38] may never depart in our neighborhoods,
[2:49:42] that we shall bear it wherever we go.
[2:49:47] We thank you Lord even for our pastor
[2:49:52] who has labored in thy field
[2:49:55] and we pray that you will bless him
[2:49:59] and bless his family
[2:50:02] and even these your children who have
[2:50:04] come here Lord
[2:50:06] to have a holy fellowship with you
[2:50:09] today.

[2:50:12] I pray Lord that you'll bless them.
[2:50:16] May your presence go with us as we leave
[2:50:18] this place.
[2:50:21] Even as we come back for the holy
[2:50:23] communion service in the afternoon
[2:50:27] again, Lord, we come with open hearts
[2:50:31] that you commune with us.
[2:50:35] May you take care of all our needs
[2:50:39] and may you supply according to your
[2:50:41] riches in glory.
[2:50:44] May you bless the week ahead of us
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; So as the pastor said the youth just
[2:51:00] stay back for some 10 minutes.
[2:51:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:51:10] can get me that song.
[2:51:16] I come to the garden.
[2:51:20] Sing that as we go.
[2:51:36] I come to
[2:51:39] the garden
[2:51:41] alone
[2:51:45] while the dew
[2:51:48] is still on the roes.
[2:51:54] And the voice
[2:51:57] I hear
[2:51:59] falling on
[2:52:01] my ears
[2:52:04] within
[2:52:06] my heart.
[2:52:08] He closes
[2:52:12] [Music]
[2:52:14] and he walks
[2:52:17] with me and he talks
[2:52:22] with me
[2:52:24] and he tells
[2:52:27] me I am his own.
[2:52:34] And the joy
[2:52:36] we share
[2:52:38] as we carry
[2:52:41] there
[2:52:43] none other
[2:52:46] has ever
[2:52:48] known as we go out.
[2:52:51] Oh he speaks and the sound. Though his
[2:52:58] voice
[2:53:01] is so sweet,
[2:53:04] the Bush
[2:53:06] their singing
[2:53:11] and the me
[2:53:16] that he gave
[2:53:18] to me
[2:53:21] within
[2:53:22] my heart
[2:53:25] is dreaming.
[2:53:33] And he walks
[2:53:37] with me and he talks
[2:53:41] with me
[2:53:43] and he tells
[2:53:46] me I am his own.
[2:53:51] [Music]
[2:53:53] And the joy
[2:53:55] we share
[2:53:58] as we tear
[2:54:01] there
[2:54:03] none other
[2:54:06] has ever
[2:54:08] known. I'll stay in the garden.
[2:54:12] I'll stay in the garden
[2:54:17] with him
[2:54:22] all the night
[2:54:24] around me before.
[2:54:31] But he beats
[2:54:33] me gold
[2:54:36] through the voice
[2:54:38] of one.
[2:54:41] His voice
[2:54:43] to me
[2:54:46] is calling
[2:54:54] and
[2:54:55] he walks
[2:54:58] with me and he talks
[2:55:03] with me
[2:55:05] and he tells
[2:55:07] me I am.
[2:55:10] his own.
[2:55:14] Oh, and the joy
[2:55:17] we share
[2:55:20] as we carry
[2:55:23] there
[2:55:25] none other
[2:55:28] has ever
[2:55:30] known.
[2:55:33] Yes,
[2:55:34] he walks
[2:55:37] with me and he talks
[2:55:42] with me and he tells
[2:55:47] me I am
[2:55:50] his own.
[2:55:53] [Music]
[2:55:54] And the joy we share
[2:55:59] as we tear
[2:56:02] them.
[2:56:04] None another
[2:56:07] has ever
[2:56:10] known.
