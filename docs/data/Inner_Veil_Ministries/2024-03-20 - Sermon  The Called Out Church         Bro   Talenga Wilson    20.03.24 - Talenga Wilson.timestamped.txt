[17:09] of this
[17:11] word amen are you happy to be in the
[17:14] house of the
[17:16] Lord amen it's such a privilege for us
[17:19] to be in the house of the
[17:21] Lord and I I believe it shall be a
[17:24] blessing to each of
[17:27] us amen
[17:30] we shall take a few
[17:32] scriptures as we open the
[17:35] Service
[17:37] amen so let's read about the parable of
[17:42] the in St Matthew
[17:46] 13
[17:50] 1 and we shall take our
[17:53] seats then after turn to the Book of
[17:57] Mark CH
[18:01] 16:14 so let's start with Matthew 13: 1
[18:08] to9 amen the same day went Jesus out of
[18:13] the house and sat by the
[18:23] seaside and great multitudes were
[18:25] gathered together unto him so that he
[18:28] went into the ship and sat and the whole
[18:31] multitude stood on the
[18:50] shore and he SP many things unto them in
[18:53] Parables saying Behold a so went forth
[18:57] to s
[19:04] and when he SED some seeds fell by the
[19:06] way site and the fs came and divide them
[19:18] up and some fell upon Stone places
[19:24] where they had not much Earth and forth
[19:28] with they sprung up because they had no
[19:31] deepness of of of
[19:48] Earth and when the sun was up they were
[19:51] scored and because they had no root they
[19:54] withered
[19:57] away
[20:01] and some fell among thorns and the
[20:03] Thorns sprang up and and choked
[20:12] them but other fell into good ground and
[20:16] brought forth fruit some 100 fold some
[20:20] 60 fold some 30
[20:27] fold
[20:34] who has ears let him
[20:38] hear may the Lord bless his
[20:42] word we may get
[20:44] seated amen amen once again we
[20:48] appreciate God for this
[20:50] opportunity amen let's stand to Mark 16
[20:53] verse
[20:57] 14
[21:00] afterward he appeared unto the 11 as
[21:02] they sat at
[21:04] me and upgraded them with their unbelief
[21:08] and Hardness of Heart because they
[21:10] believed not them which had seen him
[21:13] after he was
[21:27] Reon
[21:33] and he said unto them go into all the
[21:36] world and preach the gospel to Every
[21:44] Creature he that believeth and is
[21:47] baptized shall be saved but he that
[21:50] believeth not shall be
[21:57] damned
[22:00] amen amen so we have started with the
[22:03] Book of
[22:05] Matthew when Jesus was teaching a
[22:08] parable about the
[22:11] soul praise the Lord and this parable
[22:15] about the
[22:16] soul shows us that the soul had
[22:20] seeds and he was desirous of getting his
[22:23] seeds into the
[22:25] ground that the seeds may get into the
[22:29] ground grow up and bring him more
[22:33] fruits praise the Lord and Jesus teaches
[22:36] of the different
[22:39] grounds the different
[22:41] environments in which this seat was
[22:45] planted some in on
[22:49] ground so they could not grow deep into
[22:51] the
[22:53] Earth praise the Lord and now we see
[22:56] that some fell by the way side
[22:59] and they were eaten by the
[23:01] birs and some fell among
[23:04] thorns and as they were growing up the
[23:07] thones choked them
[23:09] up and they couldn't
[23:12] grow but then he says some fell into
[23:15] good
[23:18] ground and brought forth good
[23:22] fruit praise the Lord and that's where
[23:25] our emphasis is going to
[23:27] be praise the Lord because we believe
[23:30] that we are the seed that were planted
[23:33] on good
[23:35] ground praise the lord we are the seed
[23:38] that was planted on good
[23:41] ground that bringeth forth good
[23:45] fruit praise the Lord and now here in
[23:49] Mark 16
[23:51] says after he had appeared to the 11 he
[23:54] sat at meet with
[23:57] them and upred them with their unbelief
[24:00] and Hardness of
[24:04] Heart why because they believed not them
[24:08] which had seen him after he was
[24:12] risen and then he went ahead and
[24:15] commanded
[24:16] them that they go out into the
[24:19] world and preach the gospel to Every
[24:24] Creature so he gave them the word he
[24:27] gave them the
[24:29] to take out there and go and start
[24:34] scattering praise the Lord now he
[24:37] said he that
[24:40] believes praise the Lord the one that
[24:42] has the good
[24:44] ground and believes this
[24:47] seed and is baptized shall be
[24:51] saved praise the Lord but he that
[24:53] believeth not shall be
[24:56] damed so now the identification of those
[24:59] that are
[25:02] saved is their
[25:04] belief in the word which they have
[25:07] received praise the
[25:09] Lord to them that believe on the
[25:12] gospel the word that you
[25:15] preach and their baptized shall be
[25:18] saved praise them Living God and now it
[25:21] takes us to the book of M of Romans
[25:23] chapter
[25:25] 10 verse 13 saying
[25:29] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[25:30] the Lord shall be
[25:32] saved
[25:39] 10 how then shall they call on him in
[25:41] whom they have not
[25:44] believed remember when Jesus was asking
[25:47] the disciples to go out in the
[25:50] world he gave them the word and says
[25:54] take this word to every creature in the
[25:57] world you go and start
[25:59] sewing and now whoever Shall Believe on
[26:02] this word that you have
[26:04] taken the same shall be
[26:07] saved praise the Lord and now the Bible
[26:10] here says that the same whosoever shall
[26:13] call the name of the Lord shall be
[26:16] saved but then how shall they call on wh
[26:20] on him in whom they have not
[26:23] believed so we see that the first
[26:25] identification that we see here
[26:29] is the faith is the belief in the word
[26:32] of
[26:33] God praise the Lord and how they how
[26:36] shall they believe in whom of whom they
[26:38] have not
[26:40] heard and how shall they hear except
[26:43] there is a
[26:45] preacher and how shall they
[26:49] preach now the Bible here is is giving
[26:53] questions and every question given has
[26:56] an
[26:57] answer
[26:59] it says whoever shall call on name of
[27:00] the Lord shall be
[27:02] saved but then it asks those that call
[27:05] on name of the Lord who are
[27:08] they it should be those that have
[27:10] believed on the word of God and then he
[27:13] says but how shall they
[27:16] believe if they have not heard and then
[27:19] says there must be a preacher to
[27:22] preach and then he again asks then how
[27:25] shall the preacher
[27:27] preach
[27:29] except they be
[27:31] sent praise the Lord so now we see that
[27:34] the entire thing is not about the
[27:37] preacher the thing is not about the
[27:40] S but it's about the
[27:43] seed it's about the life in the
[27:47] seity because how will you believe if
[27:51] you have not heard and how will I preach
[27:55] except I've been sa so the Genesis of
[27:58] everything here is Jesus Christ himself
[28:02] who is the seed praise the Lord Jesus
[28:05] Christ himself the Genesis of our
[28:09] Fai and says it is written how beautiful
[28:12] are the feet of them that preach the
[28:14] gospel of
[28:16] peace and bring good Glad Tidings of
[28:20] good
[28:23] things
[28:27] 15
[28:35] verse 1 so then faith comes by
[28:41] hearing and hearing by the word of
[28:46] God praise the Lord so now for tonight
[28:50] we are trying to look at the called out
[28:54] Church a church that has been called out
[28:58] separated and set
[29:00] aside praise the Lord but when before
[29:03] this church is called
[29:05] out there is a complete
[29:09] process we have seen that the first
[29:12] thing is that the individual must
[29:15] hear when they hear they believe but
[29:20] then they cannot hear except someone has
[29:24] spoken to
[29:25] them and we have also seen that the
[29:27] person not speak to
[29:29] them except God has sent
[29:33] them to preach the good words to the
[29:36] people to bring the message to the
[29:39] people praise the Lord and now the Bible
[29:42] also says that now this
[29:46] faith that enables us to believe on the
[29:49] word which we have
[29:51] heard comes after hearing it comes by
[29:57] hearing
[29:58] and
[30:00] hearing by the word of
[30:03] God praise the Lord you hear every one
[30:07] of us can hear so many people in the
[30:09] world there have
[30:11] heard they have heard the spoken
[30:13] words but because there is nothing to
[30:17] help them
[30:20] believe because they must be the word of
[30:23] God to help them
[30:26] believe the same which we are
[30:29] hearing the same word that helps us to
[30:32] believe
[30:33] it praise the Lord says faith comes by
[30:37] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[30:41] and now what is the word of God Jesus
[30:44] Christ is the word of God in the
[30:47] beginning was the word and the same word
[30:50] was with God and the same Word was God
[30:54] that is that is John 1 verse one when
[30:58] you slop down there you see that the
[31:01] word of God is Jesus Christ himself so
[31:05] now if we hear and and Believe by the
[31:10] help of the word of God that it is
[31:13] Christ
[31:14] himself who helps us to believe on his
[31:17] words praise the Lord faith comes by
[31:20] hearing and hearing by the word of
[31:23] God so now you receive this
[31:26] face after expressing your
[31:31] obedience towards the word which you
[31:33] have
[31:34] heard praise the Lord the gospel of
[31:38] peace which is given to us by hearing
[31:42] this spoken
[31:45] word now let's see what Timothy says
[31:48] second Timothy 3:
[31:51] 16 all scripture is given by inspiration
[31:54] of
[31:56] God
[31:59] and is profitable for
[32:01] Doctrine all scripture is
[32:04] given by inspiration of
[32:07] God and now the same scripture which is
[32:10] given after it's been inspired by
[32:15] God helps us to
[32:17] believe on the word of God and is
[32:21] profitable for
[32:23] doctr for
[32:24] reproof for
[32:26] reproof for
[32:28] correction for instruction in
[32:33] righteousness that the man of God may be
[32:39] perfect th fished and all good
[32:56] works
[33:07] so now our
[33:09] faith in the word of God is a Divine
[33:14] response is a Divine
[33:17] response to the word of God and this
[33:23] response
[33:25] comes from within us
[33:28] it comes from your
[33:30] soul praise the Lord I want us to take a
[33:33] little bit of uh let us stud the
[33:37] chemistry of growth so we started when
[33:40] Jesus was giving a parable of a
[33:44] s who got his seeds and he went and
[33:48] planted them so now when they saw
[33:51] planted the seeds he was expecting the
[33:55] seeds to
[33:56] grow he expect that these seeds would
[34:00] grow and give him
[34:02] fruits and so he could get more seeds in
[34:05] the
[34:07] end praise the Lord and now a
[34:10] seed will not show its abilities to grow
[34:14] and sprung
[34:16] up unless it's been
[34:19] placed in a very suitable
[34:23] conditions praise the Lord yet the seed
[34:28] has the
[34:29] ability to grow and bear more fruits
[34:33] praise the Lord when you get a seed a
[34:36] live seed inside that seed is the
[34:40] ability for to grow and bear more fruits
[34:46] but as long as the seed is there and
[34:49] does not have the suitable conditions
[34:51] for it to
[34:53] grow it shall not grow and you will not
[34:56] see it AB to
[34:58] grow but the moment the so gets this
[35:02] seat and places it in the good
[35:06] ground praise the Lord the seed will now
[35:10] begin manifesting its
[35:14] abilities praise the Lord the seed will
[35:17] now start portraying the chemistry on
[35:19] theide of
[35:21] it to begin growing so in the first
[35:25] place we need to
[35:26] know any seed that is liable to
[35:31] germination has all the
[35:34] elements it
[35:36] requires to grow praise the Lord so when
[35:40] you get this seat inside that seat we
[35:44] have the
[35:45] carbohydrates required to give energy to
[35:49] this seed as long as it has been placed
[35:51] in the good
[35:52] ground ins that seed we have all the
[35:56] proteins the Lord and all the
[36:00] nutrients and all the
[36:03] minerals the potassium magnesium theum
[36:08] all the minerals
[36:09] required to give this this seed
[36:13] energy for it to grow praise the Lord
[36:17] but now this seed as long as does not
[36:21] land on the good
[36:23] ground praise the Lord it shall not show
[36:26] forth its abilities
[36:28] praise the Lord so in the like
[36:30] manner when we are still out there
[36:34] before you receive the word
[36:36] of you have the
[36:38] ability to receive this word and believe
[36:41] it why because on the inside of us is
[36:46] the seed which Bears the life of
[36:49] God praise the Lord so as long as you
[36:52] are still scattered out there you are
[36:55] not in position to manif
[36:58] your abilities to believe on the word of
[37:01] God until you come in contact with the
[37:05] word of God praise them Living God so
[37:08] when this seed is placed
[37:10] there now the chemistry
[37:13] begins and now it requires
[37:16] moisture from the soils around it
[37:20] requires water it requires oxygen to
[37:24] help in the
[37:26] synthesis
[37:28] synthesizing to to help in breaking down
[37:32] the nutrients on the inside of this SE
[37:36] to help break down the
[37:38] carbohydrates requires the oxygen to
[37:41] give it energy it requires this water to
[37:46] break the shei to now allow the
[37:50] nutrients ground from the soil to come
[37:53] and Mi the nutrients inside this SE at
[37:57] the end of the day you are able to see
[38:00] the seed growing up so now when you
[38:02] receive this word of God praise the Lord
[38:06] says the faith that you
[38:08] have the faith that you receive to
[38:12] believe the word of God given to you by
[38:15] the help of the word of
[38:17] God praise the Lord so we now we notice
[38:21] that our
[38:22] election we notice that our faith in the
[38:26] word of God
[38:28] is by God himself but in the first place
[38:31] it must be a
[38:33] seed it must be a live
[38:36] seat that's why the Bible says whoever
[38:39] Shall Believe whoever believeth and is
[38:44] baptized and now how do you believe you
[38:47] believe because of the word that is
[38:50] being
[38:51] spoken the word that is being spoken
[38:54] there the same life sits on the inside
[38:58] of your soul so now when this word is
[39:01] being
[39:01] spoken you respond by believing
[39:05] it why because you already have that
[39:10] life that was given to us the foundation
[39:14] of the world so now how do we believe
[39:17] how do we receive this
[39:19] salvation Salvation is given to us by
[39:23] God himself praise the Lord when the
[39:26] soul went out so
[39:28] he so the seats and those that fell in
[39:31] the ther
[39:32] ground could not grow up because the
[39:35] environment was not
[39:37] condusive those that
[39:39] fell on their on Rocket
[39:42] grounds did not have enough
[39:45] energy why because as they were trying
[39:48] to grow their Roots reached
[39:52] somewhere and could not
[39:54] continue because the ground was not
[39:58] sufficient the ground was not healthy
[40:02] enough for the seed to root down and
[40:07] grow but yet there is a
[40:10] seed that fell on good
[40:13] ground there is a seed that fell on the
[40:16] side of your soul that fell on the side
[40:19] of my soul and when fell there it found
[40:23] an
[40:24] abort it found a condition the
[40:27] environment had been
[40:29] prepared praise the Lord and as long as
[40:32] that seed
[40:34] remains in the good ground it shall grow
[40:39] and it shall bear
[40:41] fruits praise the Living
[40:43] God now God is very
[40:46] faithful he's a very faithful God by for
[40:51] knowledge he planted his
[40:55] seed he planted his
[40:58] SE each of us
[41:00] Soul before the foundation of the world
[41:04] and by
[41:05] predestination he makes us to come into
[41:07] contact with the
[41:09] word each of us has it own
[41:13] season which now this
[41:16] contact is the environment that
[41:20] evokes is the environment that invokes
[41:25] resurrection of all the sleep
[41:27] elements of the life of God in
[41:32] us and this
[41:34] environment is the gospel of peace this
[41:37] environment is the spoken word this
[41:40] environment is the presence of God so
[41:43] now when you hear the word of
[41:45] God you need to be kept in the presence
[41:47] of God and when you keep yourself in the
[41:50] presence of God now continues to provide
[41:55] all the
[41:56] nutrients provide all the
[41:58] conditions that are necessary to resect
[42:02] all the Sleeping
[42:05] elements praise the Lord and now he then
[42:08] makes he
[42:10] continues praise the Lord grow you into
[42:15] the sture of a perfect
[42:18] man now because after you have had the
[42:21] word of God and you have believed he now
[42:25] brings you in his presence he brings you
[42:29] under his
[42:31] tutorship because the Bible said how
[42:33] then shall they
[42:35] preach except they be
[42:37] S praise the Lord and also says all
[42:42] scriptures come by
[42:44] inspiration of God himself so now after
[42:47] we have
[42:48] believed he now calls us out he brings
[42:52] us out he brings us out and he places us
[42:55] before his presence he preses us before
[42:58] his presence where he begins now to
[43:01] teach us to teach us his ways in so
[43:05] doing he's watering us to
[43:08] grow every other time we come in his
[43:11] presence to hear the word of God your
[43:14] faith continues to grow your faith
[43:17] continues to grow in other words your
[43:20] seed is
[43:21] growing into a perfect
[43:25] nature praise the Lord continues to
[43:27] water you to give you a desire desire
[43:32] more of him more of his
[43:35] environment more of his
[43:37] presence to hear more of his words and
[43:41] the more we keep in his
[43:43] presence praise the Lord the more this
[43:47] seed structure gets
[43:50] clearer to the identity of Jesus
[43:54] Christ praise the Lord the chemistry of
[43:59] grow
[44:00] begins when you receive the word of
[44:03] God praise the Lord it begins when you
[44:07] come the word of God and after all
[44:10] coming the word of
[44:11] God accepted it then he keeps you in his
[44:16] presence praise the Lord and now the
[44:20] life on the inside of you praise the
[44:23] Lord which was given of you begins the
[44:27] chem chemical
[44:30] reactions the process
[44:32] begins the water because the
[44:36] says whoever believes and is
[44:39] baptized so now he gives you Grace
[44:42] enough to
[44:44] believe his word and to be baptized and
[44:48] when you are
[44:49] baptized by water he cleanses you he
[44:54] justifies you and then after he has
[44:56] Justified
[44:58] he brings you before his presence and
[45:00] now he begins to teach and he teaches us
[45:04] and the more the word is being spoken
[45:07] begins to sanctify us because when the
[45:09] seed comes out of the ground it is not
[45:12] enough for it to bear fruit it must go
[45:15] through a process and this process
[45:17] requires
[45:19] pruning praise the Lord as the seed is
[45:22] growing into a plant it has to be pruned
[45:27] because when the farmer leaves it there
[45:29] and he leaves it under
[45:31] Wheats it shall wither the whe shall out
[45:36] compete and take out all its
[45:39] nutrients it shall not grow but the seed
[45:42] must be
[45:43] water the seed must be
[45:45] pruned and as it's being
[45:48] pruned it takes on now the form of the
[45:51] real plant until it Bears the fruits so
[45:56] when calls us in his
[45:58] presence he begins to teach us and he
[46:02] begins to prune us all the
[46:05] habits that inherited from the world
[46:09] when we come we come before his presence
[46:12] and the word of God is being
[46:14] preached continues to speak to our
[46:16] hearts and as the preacher is preaching
[46:19] the scripture that is by inspiration of
[46:22] God teaches to your heart condition
[46:25] speaks to your heart and then you come
[46:27] to
[46:28] acknowledge that God has spoken to you
[46:31] that this is not required of you then
[46:34] you quit it and as you keep yourself in
[46:37] his presence again he speaks your heart
[46:40] that as a Son of God you are not
[46:43] supposed to take this
[46:45] direction then you change and you obey
[46:48] his word and you continue obeying his
[46:50] word and continue obeying his word in
[46:54] his presence he continues to do his
[46:57] works praise the Lord and now no
[47:01] man comes to the father except the
[47:06] father calls him to himself praise the
[47:10] Lord let's take that
[47:24] scripture praise the name Living God no
[47:27] man comes to the
[47:28] father except the father has
[47:31] called to himself so it begins with the
[47:35] father it begins with God
[47:38] himself nobody comes to the son except
[47:41] the father
[47:43] has praise the Lord so now we see that
[47:47] it's a very simple thing for us to
[47:50] receive salvation is that when we
[47:52] believe the word when we hear the word
[47:55] and we have believed it
[47:58] it is now it becomes the responsibility
[48:00] of
[48:01] God to start nurturing
[48:05] us to the St of a perfect
[48:08] man praise the Lord it now seem us to be
[48:11] our
[48:13] responsibility our first
[48:16] responsibility is to believe welcome the
[48:20] word of God believe it and believe that
[48:23] it is the
[48:24] truth even though it's our respons
[48:28] still we don't do it by our
[48:31] own but he helps us to believe his word
[48:36] so the entire
[48:37] salvation is of the Lord praise the Lord
[48:41] the entire work of
[48:43] Salvation is of the Lord so he begins
[48:46] the work to call us
[48:48] outes us into his presence and then he
[48:53] begins to nurture us to work upon
[48:58] praise the name of living God so now
[49:01] let's see what the prophet says in the
[49:04] message five definite identifications of
[49:06] the True Church of the Living
[49:09] God the prophet speaks about
[49:13] Israel speaks about the children of
[49:16] Israel when they were still in
[49:20] Egypt praise the Lord they were called
[49:23] the children of
[49:25] Israel praise the Lord
[49:27] and they were under their own
[49:30] care they had work day and night to
[49:35] receive something to eat they had to
[49:38] labor to have a clothing on their
[49:42] bodies praise the Lord but the moment he
[49:45] called them
[49:47] out praise the Lord and he accepted
[49:51] him and pulled them out of
[49:55] Egypt ceased to be their
[49:59] responsibility it was now the
[50:01] responsibility of God and they ceased to
[50:04] be called the children of
[50:06] Israel but now they were the children of
[50:10] God praise the Lord so that the prophet
[50:13] says now Israel was the people of
[50:17] God until that then they were called The
[50:21] Church of
[50:23] God because they were called by God out
[50:25] ofy
[50:27] out of the world out away from other
[50:31] churches out away from other religions
[50:34] to walk with God alone and now the
[50:37] Church of God today is the same
[50:40] thing called out of everything of The
[50:45] World God himself calling
[50:49] our out of every religious
[50:52] C of every religious
[50:55] denomination
[50:57] of every religious
[51:00] organization to walk with God praise the
[51:04] Lord he calls us
[51:06] out to walk with him and now when he
[51:09] calls us out to walk with him we now
[51:14] become his complete
[51:18] responsibility and the Bible says in
[51:20] John 16
[51:24] ver3 how about when he the spirit of
[51:26] Truth is
[51:29] come he will guide you into all
[51:33] Truth for he shall not speak of
[51:37] himself but whatever he shall
[51:41] hear that he shall
[51:44] speak and he will show you all things to
[51:49] come still in his good
[51:53] will when he calls us out his
[51:56] responsibility to show us the
[51:59] truth and to guide us through all
[52:03] truth to help us grow into a perfect man
[52:08] to be like him praise the Lord it is his
[52:13] responsibility to take charge of us so
[52:16] now when we in his
[52:19] presence now he begins to
[52:21] bring all the nutrients
[52:24] required when we out out of the
[52:27] ground when we are out of the world and
[52:31] we have been
[52:32] exposed to the harsh conditions of
[52:35] Life takes his
[52:38] responsibility to begin to provide for
[52:41] us with all the conditions that we
[52:44] require grow into a perfect
[52:47] man how praise the Lord when in his
[52:50] presence he shall bring a brother he now
[52:54] brings the fivefold Ministries
[52:57] to keep you on
[52:59] track he shall bring a
[53:01] brother from somewhere to speak to your
[53:05] heart he shall bring the pastor he the
[53:08] pastor to come with the word which you
[53:11] directly speak to your
[53:13] heart in other words he's keeping on
[53:16] grounding
[53:17] you to make our roots to grow
[53:21] deeper such that when the storms
[53:25] come when begin to blow you shall go the
[53:30] East you got the west but still you
[53:33] shall remain
[53:34] standing why because it is his
[53:38] responsibility he has now provided you
[53:40] with
[53:41] environment with the words to root you
[53:45] down such that even when well doctrines
[53:48] come you you are a with understand them
[53:52] because you have been taught well his
[53:55] responsibility
[53:57] after he has called us out to take care
[54:00] of us not only in the
[54:02] spiritual but also in the physical
[54:05] needs praise the name of the Living God
[54:08] just like we saw last
[54:09] Wednesday but when he calls us as
[54:13] children praise the Lord it is still his
[54:17] responsibility in his good will you
[54:20] provide for whatever we have need
[54:23] of why because it is a promise that when
[54:27] we obey and seek
[54:30] first his kingdom and his righteousness
[54:35] we don't get heard of any other thing
[54:37] wild
[54:38] doctrines yes the Bible says they will
[54:41] come by the time they come you have been
[54:45] taught well and you can withstand that
[54:48] pressure praise the Lord the hard time
[54:51] will come yes it will come but the time
[54:54] it comes your faith has been grounded in
[54:57] the
[54:58] word and it cannot be moved it is in his
[55:03] own
[55:05] will and
[55:06] responsibility to us into his
[55:10] word Ephesians 1:
[55:13] 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus
[55:17] Christ the father of
[55:19] Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[55:24] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[55:26] of
[55:27] him that the eyes of your understanding
[55:31] being
[55:34] enlightened that you may
[55:36] know what is the hope of his
[55:40] calling praise the Lord the god of our
[55:43] Lord Jesus Christ
[55:45] himself praise the Lord that he may give
[55:48] you
[55:49] wisdom and
[55:52] Revelation in the knowledge of him that
[55:55] your eyes may be enlightened with
[56:00] understanding that you may know what is
[56:02] the hope of his
[56:03] calling and what the riches of his glory
[56:08] of the glory of his inheritance in the
[56:25] Saints
[56:27] that the
[56:28] eyes of your
[56:30] understanding that the eyes that your
[56:34] face praise the Lord because it says
[56:38] that the father of Glory may give us the
[56:41] spirit of
[56:43] wisdom after he has separated us and
[56:47] made us a separated
[56:49] church and made us his people that he
[56:53] may give us the wisdom
[56:57] the spirit of wisdom and
[57:01] Revelation in the knowledge of him so if
[57:05] we need know more of
[57:07] him it is still by him that he gives us
[57:11] the spirit of
[57:13] wisdom and knowledge to know more of him
[57:16] praise the Lord if we need know more of
[57:18] the
[57:19] scriptures is still by his help that he
[57:22] gives us the understanding to understand
[57:25] the
[57:26] ration of his word so now we see that
[57:30] the entire work of
[57:32] Salvation is of God and by God himself
[57:37] praise the Lord because he does not end
[57:39] on calling you but he calls you and he
[57:43] brings you in his presence then he
[57:45] starts to teach
[57:47] you and as he's teaching you the Bible
[57:50] says he also gives you the spirit of
[57:55] wisdom
[57:57] praise the Lord to know what to know
[57:59] more of his
[58:01] words so you are able to
[58:04] discern when the world doctrines come
[58:07] into place you have the wisdom and the
[58:11] Revelation to know that it is not the
[58:14] truth and that is only by God himself
[58:18] and say such that your
[58:20] eyes the eyes of your
[58:23] understanding may be enlightened
[58:27] and you
[58:28] know what is the
[58:30] hope of his calling and know the hope of
[58:34] his calling praise the Lord he not to
[58:37] call us and leave us here but is to help
[58:40] us to grow in his world to help us to
[58:43] grow into a
[58:45] St of a perfect man say that out of us
[58:50] makes a church that has no spot out of
[58:54] us makes the perfect church that has no
[58:58] wrinkle the B says that now when we come
[59:01] to that
[59:02] point and when he
[59:05] appears we shall be like him praise the
[59:08] Lord because in his presence he has
[59:11] worked on us he has worked on you praise
[59:15] the Lord so now we come to
[59:17] realize that the Journey of our
[59:20] face the Journey of the Lord
[59:23] himself because at the end of the day
[59:26] his goal is to have a
[59:30] bride that can identify with
[59:33] him that Bri must be he that has the
[59:39] seed of Christ himself and this seed
[59:43] there is no seed will
[59:45] grow unless it's been placed in the
[59:49] ground when it comes out of the
[59:51] ground it will die if it is not nured
[59:56] and it is God himself who shall water
[59:59] this seed so the seed that we have we
[1:00:02] don't need to get worried of it it is
[1:00:05] God himself who has planted in us and is
[1:00:09] God himself who shall water it it comes
[1:00:12] to maturity because we have a promise
[1:00:16] that out of us must be a church out of
[1:00:20] us must be a church that has no spot
[1:00:24] that has no wrinkles but how will the
[1:00:26] wrinkles go away they shall go by the
[1:00:30] purification of the
[1:00:31] word they shall get away by the
[1:00:35] sanctification by The Living Waters of
[1:00:37] the world the ring shall go away by the
[1:00:41] preaching of the spoken word and as the
[1:00:44] word is being
[1:00:45] preached we see
[1:00:47] ourselves
[1:00:49] growing every other
[1:00:51] day that
[1:00:53] St of a perf man when we get there he
[1:00:58] shall now come to
[1:01:00] harvest when the farmer plants the
[1:01:03] seeds waiting for the SE praise the Lord
[1:01:07] tomorrow he shall see the C he shall see
[1:01:11] them springing up and then his patient
[1:01:15] he will go and water it he will go and
[1:01:18] start
[1:01:19] weeding tomorrow he goes back and then
[1:01:23] he sees it is coming up then he begins
[1:01:26] weeding again
[1:01:29] anding and he's not
[1:01:31] celebrating because he has not yet
[1:01:34] seen the fruits and the seeds thereof so
[1:01:38] he continues through the work of a
[1:01:42] farmer and our chief
[1:01:44] farmer is the Lord himself the farmer of
[1:01:48] the seed that lives on the inside of us
[1:01:52] is the Lord Jesus himself praise the
[1:01:54] Lord so every day he comes around to see
[1:01:59] how the plant is
[1:02:00] doing because what his
[1:02:03] desire is to see a
[1:02:06] seed out of this plant a seed that has
[1:02:10] his own
[1:02:12] likess a seed that is in that perfect
[1:02:17] St praise the Lord and the Bible says in
[1:02:21] Revelations
[1:02:24] 21
[1:02:28] now let's start with first John chapter
[1:02:30] 3 it says
[1:02:33] beloved now we are the sons of
[1:02:37] God
[1:02:43] 3 we are the sons of God who are the
[1:02:48] sons of God them that have the seed of
[1:02:53] God because there is no we can be
[1:02:57] identifi as Sons if we are not bearing
[1:03:00] of his
[1:03:01] life praise the Lord a son is identified
[1:03:04] by his
[1:03:05] father because they share an
[1:03:09] identity what makes us Sons is because
[1:03:12] we have the seed of him the father and
[1:03:16] says beloved now that we have received
[1:03:20] the word of God now that we have
[1:03:23] believed this
[1:03:24] words we are the sons of God and it does
[1:03:28] not end there and says it does not yet
[1:03:33] appear what we shall be because we are
[1:03:37] still we are still
[1:03:39] plants the seeds have been planted and
[1:03:42] out of the SE are now the
[1:03:45] sons and now we are simply
[1:03:48] sons that are still growing and right
[1:03:51] now it is not
[1:03:54] certain of what we shall be but we know
[1:03:59] by faith we know that when he shall
[1:04:04] appear when the father shall
[1:04:07] appear we shall be like
[1:04:10] him why because we have his
[1:04:14] life we bear his seed and we are
[1:04:18] carrying his SE so even if we don't know
[1:04:21] what we shall be but because we are
[1:04:24] certain that we have
[1:04:26] see we know that when he shall appear we
[1:04:30] shall be like him for we shall see
[1:04:33] him as he is praise the Lord this is a
[1:04:39] process and we are growing there by day
[1:04:43] into
[1:04:44] that and Revelation
[1:04:48] says God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:04:52] their
[1:04:54] eyes because of the TRS of the
[1:04:58] journey we shall be
[1:05:01] scorched and we shall weep
[1:05:04] sometimes but we are still
[1:05:06] Sons we have his life and he is not
[1:05:10] going to leave us on the way he shall
[1:05:13] continue to send the r he shall continue
[1:05:16] to send his words he shall to send the
[1:05:19] gopel PE to give us
[1:05:23] energy sufficient energy to grow
[1:05:26] so when you come in his presence and the
[1:05:29] word is
[1:05:30] spoken it reaches down to your heart and
[1:05:33] then you get the energy to continue
[1:05:36] pushing through praise the Lord because
[1:05:39] on the inside of the seat all
[1:05:42] the necessary to help it
[1:05:46] grow we
[1:05:48] have all the spiritual
[1:05:54] elements what what we require is the
[1:05:58] watering so every time he Waters every
[1:06:02] time he sends the rain and the rain
[1:06:05] Waters receive the energy so it may find
[1:06:09] us in the L
[1:06:10] St in a state of
[1:06:13] discomfort praise the Lord in a state of
[1:06:17] complaints but when it reaches to the
[1:06:19] soul praise the Lord it energizes you
[1:06:23] throw away all the worries
[1:06:26] moving
[1:06:27] forward nether no
[1:06:30] crying neither shall there be any more
[1:06:33] pain for all the former
[1:06:36] things passed away and he that sat upon
[1:06:40] the
[1:06:41] throne says
[1:06:43] behold I make all things
[1:06:46] you praise the Lord and he said unto me
[1:06:50] right for these words are true and
[1:06:54] faithful say behold
[1:06:56] I make old things new all old
[1:07:00] things are passed away praise the Lord
[1:07:04] what is the purpose of God is to have a
[1:07:07] perfect church and perfect
[1:07:11] Church he's doing a great
[1:07:13] work in our M to make us look like
[1:07:19] him praise the Lord and how does he make
[1:07:22] us look like
[1:07:24] him gives us his word praise the Lord
[1:07:28] and by his word we keep growing praise
[1:07:32] the lord we keep growing we keep growing
[1:07:36] and behold the Tabernacle of
[1:07:40] God of God is with
[1:07:43] men and he will dwell with
[1:07:47] them and they shall be his people and
[1:07:50] God
[1:07:51] himself shall be with them and be their
[1:07:55] God
[1:07:56] the Tabernacle of
[1:07:57] God is with men is with his people and
[1:08:02] he shall be they shall be his
[1:08:05] people and he shall be their
[1:08:08] God when we receive him and receive of
[1:08:12] his life he comes down
[1:08:16] and and the Tabernacle of God begins to
[1:08:20] dwell with men so regardless of who we
[1:08:24] are
[1:08:26] that seed of God Bears the life of God
[1:08:31] and at the end of the road he must see
[1:08:35] his
[1:08:36] seed his life coming forth and when he
[1:08:40] shall
[1:08:41] appear when we look at him and you look
[1:08:44] at yourself and you look at your
[1:08:47] neighbor and you look at your brother
[1:08:50] you shall see that we shall be like him
[1:08:53] because each of us is bearing the seed
[1:08:57] of God each of us is bearing the life of
[1:09:00] God and we have if we have the life of
[1:09:03] God then at the end of the road we shall
[1:09:07] be like him it is his
[1:09:10] responsibility we just need to
[1:09:12] trust and obey his trust and obey every
[1:09:18] time trust and Obey when the word Goes
[1:09:22] Forth however even if it is very had to
[1:09:26] believe just trust and Obey praise the
[1:09:30] Lord just trust him keep obeying and as
[1:09:35] you obeying and healing yourself to him
[1:09:38] he keeps
[1:09:39] nurturing he keeps
[1:09:41] nurturing and taking you in the way of
[1:09:46] his own
[1:09:47] will because at the end of the day he's
[1:09:51] doing his work see that when you come
[1:09:56] on harvest time you are able to bear his
[1:10:00] own likeness you are able to be in his
[1:10:04] own image and in his own
[1:10:07] likeness praise the name of living God
[1:10:09] because we have faith that what was in
[1:10:12] the
[1:10:13] beginning must be at the end of days if
[1:10:17] in the beginning he created us after in
[1:10:22] his own image and after his own likeness
[1:10:26] praise the Lord along the way so much
[1:10:29] shall happen that shall cause us to cry
[1:10:32] that shall cause us to sorrow that shall
[1:10:35] cause us to stumble but as long as we
[1:10:38] keep ourselves in the presence of
[1:10:40] God it is his own
[1:10:43] will that we still get back to his own
[1:10:47] image after his own likeness that's why
[1:10:50] scripture says that it does not
[1:10:53] matter what we are and what we shall be
[1:10:58] we don't know but we are confident of
[1:11:01] one
[1:11:02] thing that which was in the
[1:11:04] beginning praise the Lord when he
[1:11:07] created man we are certain that it shall
[1:11:11] come to
[1:11:12] pass it is what shall be when he
[1:11:16] appears and we shall be like him praise
[1:11:20] the name of living God so the church a
[1:11:23] called out Church is the work of God a
[1:11:27] church that is called out is the work of
[1:11:30] God a church that is under the presence
[1:11:32] of
[1:11:33] God the work of God so what does the
[1:11:36] church have to do we need to be like
[1:11:39] Israel the moment they
[1:11:42] recognized that now God has called them
[1:11:44] out of
[1:11:46] EG whatever they
[1:11:48] required praise the Lord they knew that
[1:11:51] it was the responsibility of God to
[1:11:54] provide
[1:11:55] praise the Lord because the promise was
[1:11:58] you have a land where you are
[1:12:02] going land that is prepared for you that
[1:12:06] with milk and honey and they were not
[1:12:08] digging on the way you not planting so
[1:12:12] now they knew that the person who
[1:12:15] started this
[1:12:17] work of calling them out of
[1:12:20] Egypt had the
[1:12:23] responsibility to take care of of them
[1:12:26] even along the way so when they fell
[1:12:29] sick praise the Lord regardless of
[1:12:32] whether the sickness was because of
[1:12:34] their
[1:12:37] Disobedience they still looked up to
[1:12:39] Moses they still look up to God praise
[1:12:43] the Lord when they were hungry in the
[1:12:46] morning they were very sure that whether
[1:12:50] they had food or not that God will
[1:12:53] provide food in the morning
[1:12:55] because it was a promise that was given
[1:12:58] to them and when they were obedient to
[1:13:00] the promise they were confident that God
[1:13:04] would keep his promise to supply all
[1:13:07] their needs so in this our
[1:13:10] journey after we have
[1:13:12] believed we have one duty surrender all
[1:13:17] ourselves unto him praise the Lord
[1:13:21] surrender all our
[1:13:23] Affairs unto him the children of Israel
[1:13:27] surrendered and they were very confident
[1:13:30] that man would rain in the morning they
[1:13:33] were confident that when they needed
[1:13:35] water in the wilderness they were
[1:13:38] getting it from nowhere
[1:13:40] else any they were sure that God would
[1:13:44] provide the water praise the Lord why
[1:13:48] they were on the way they were in the
[1:13:51] journey and they were in The Promise
[1:13:55] they had kept the word they had believed
[1:13:58] the word and they had come out of Egypt
[1:14:01] praise the Lord and so they looked on
[1:14:04] him they looked up to him when the enemy
[1:14:08] struck they still looked up to him they
[1:14:11] knew he was their
[1:14:12] protection that's why in the day he
[1:14:16] provided the clouds praise the Lord and
[1:14:19] in the night proved a pillar of
[1:14:22] fire it was God
[1:14:26] it was God in the and it had to be God
[1:14:30] all into
[1:14:32] Canan was God when he called us out when
[1:14:36] he gave us his word when the seed was
[1:14:39] sown and you receive the word that was
[1:14:43] God and when you come here now it is
[1:14:46] still God that is leading all the way we
[1:14:49] simply have to be like
[1:14:51] children very confident because before
[1:14:55] him we are children and the child as
[1:14:58] long as the father is there is very
[1:15:01] confident of food he does not mind
[1:15:05] praise the Lord whether it is during
[1:15:07] fine he's very confident that father
[1:15:11] somehow will provide us with food praise
[1:15:14] the Lord isent somehow that when I fall
[1:15:18] sick father will take me to hospital
[1:15:21] he's very sure because he's a child and
[1:15:24] he's enti
[1:15:26] dependent is entirely
[1:15:29] dependent on the father and we are
[1:15:31] children before him he has called us and
[1:15:34] two children and now it is his
[1:15:37] responsibility so we need to take
[1:15:39] Liberty in the word of God as long as we
[1:15:43] are
[1:15:43] submissive
