[22:43] know
[22:45] about you and thank
[22:48] you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[22:51] pray amen amen let's turn to the Book of
[22:54] Luke chap
[22:56] 15 and
[23:08] the scripture
[23:11] says either what
[23:13] woman having 10 pieces of silver if she
[23:17] lose one piece does not light a candle
[23:20] and sweep the house and seek diligently
[23:23] till she find it
[23:41] and when she has found it she call her
[23:44] friends and her neighbors together
[23:47] saying Rejoice with me for I have found
[23:50] the peace which I had lost
[24:05] let's once
[24:07] moreci Lord we pray that may you come
[24:11] and bless your
[24:13] word in Jesus's name we pray you may
[24:17] take your
[24:20] seat praise the name of the
[24:23] Lord I just want to speak to you this
[24:26] evening on the subject of the sac
[24:40] value amen the
[24:45] value so I I'm believing that God will
[24:48] speak to each one of us this
[24:52] evening so to begin
[24:54] with uh sacred value
[25:00] so
[25:02] sa sa means something that is highly
[25:09] valued something that is
[25:12] important something that is Holy
[25:28] is not must
[25:31] holy praise the name of the Lord and
[25:34] when I talk about
[25:36] value this evening I want us talk about
[25:40] two compound meanings of
[25:51] value as things that are that deserve a
[25:55] high you know regard
[25:59] something that is very
[26:02] important something that is very
[26:06] useful praise the name of the Lord and
[26:09] in this definition of
[26:11] values I want to talk
[26:14] about the things that are so much
[26:18] useful the things that are so much
[26:23] significant in the life of a
[26:26] Christian praise the name of Lord and
[26:29] these same things are principles or
[26:32] ethics or morals of
[26:38] Christianity these are
[26:41] behaviors or you know in games they call
[26:44] them rules of
[26:48] conduct praise the name of the Lord so
[26:51] and then another definition I want to
[26:53] deal with this
[26:57] evening value as
[27:02] one that is something of great
[27:07] worth that Christian would want to you
[27:10] know invest
[27:13] in that every Christian would want to
[27:16] see that he participate or takes part of
[27:21] that praise the name of the Lord so
[27:25] heaven heaven and earth shall pass away
[27:30] the things on this Earth shall pass away
[27:34] there is nothing
[27:36] Eternal except the sa
[27:38] Souls praise the name of the Lord all
[27:42] the efforts of
[27:45] M will go to
[27:47] D at the end of the road except the
[27:51] souls of
[27:52] men that have been
[27:55] saved praise the name of the Lord
[27:58] the of a
[28:00] Believer praise the name of the Lord
[28:04] example a person who is going to
[28:07] marry like my brother
[28:10] here any time once he hears the call he
[28:13] will be looking for someone
[28:22] to praise the name of the so he will
[28:26] have to look for a specific
[28:30] you are we together you have to look for
[28:34] a specific
[28:38] character and that's the that is the you
[28:40] know that's the
[28:42] measure that is going to use to settle
[28:45] upon a specific
[28:49] sister like
[28:51] other when you're looking for a
[28:53] wife you look for a specific character
[28:58] specific
[28:59] value the name of the Lord and our
[29:03] character many
[29:05] times we have
[29:09] heard when we are going to begin you
[29:11] know when when we are going to get into
[29:13] the marriage
[29:15] phase you are
[29:17] told look for
[29:19] character know one time brother asked
[29:22] me what do you mean by
[29:26] character the name of the Lord
[29:29] you know so
[29:30] character is a distinguishing
[29:35] future praise the name of the Lord a
[29:41] trait a complex of trait or a mixture of
[29:49] traits that makes a
[29:52] person or a
[29:54] group or a breed or a breed
[30:03] so different from
[30:05] another and that's the same
[30:09] way that's the same way that a Christian
[30:13] should be in this
[30:18] world to have a specific
[30:21] value distinguish
[30:23] you the rest of the
[30:25] people the name of the Lord I want to
[30:28] get into this spot here where the
[30:31] Prophet was talking about a
[30:34] hunter know the field to
[30:37] hun and he says and you have to know the
[30:40] characteristic of the
[30:43] animal that you are
[30:45] hunting or sometimes you can be
[30:48] certainly
[30:49] deceived for
[30:51] instance like the stone
[30:54] ship the stone ship way up in in British
[30:57] Colombia
[30:59] [Music]
[31:04] praise the name of the
[31:06] Lord now he was giving an
[31:10] example that for example when you're
[31:12] going to
[31:13] hunt and you're looking for a
[31:16] ship there is a certain kind of ship
[31:18] called the stone
[31:20] ship this ship looks so similar to the
[31:26] there and he says he continues down and
[31:29] say now if you didn't know the
[31:33] difference when you was going to track a
[31:35] ship over there you couldn't tell the
[31:39] difference unless you was a shrewd
[31:46] Hunter you a shrew
[31:51] Hunter because they make the same kind
[31:53] of tracks
[31:58] they bound when they run
[32:01] away and when you see one standing at a
[32:05] distance with his
[32:10] head you hardly know the
[32:14] difference praise the name of the Lord
[32:16] so you must have the the specific state
[32:20] of a specific animal before before you
[32:22] go to H
[32:28] and then he says in paragraph
[32:31] 15 the goat walking
[32:34] also and the goat walking
[32:38] also there is a characteristic in a
[32:42] goat under
[32:45] ship that you would have to know the
[32:47] difference in
[32:50] them when you were up
[32:52] high because they both dwell high in the
[32:56] mountain
[32:58] you have to know the
[32:59] difference but if you notice God
[33:02] stumbles himself as he
[33:06] walks while a sheep sits his feet down
[33:09] like
[33:13] this the the characteristic of the way
[33:16] he makes his
[33:20] tracks your game by the characteristic
[33:23] of of what it does
[33:28] and how it
[33:30] acts Lord so for us to know who we
[33:34] are for us to examine
[33:37] ourselves where we are
[33:40] standing we go to look into the the law
[33:43] of
[33:45] Liberty
[33:47] the the
[33:49] scripture What is the
[33:52] characteristic of the child of
[33:55] God let's start the book of Galatians
[33:57] chapter for As We Lay a little bit of a
[33:59] foundation for us to stand
[34:04] on praise the name of the
[34:11] Lordan he
[34:13] says now I
[34:19] say now I say that the hair as long as
[34:22] he is a child defer nothing from a
[34:25] servant though he be Lord of all
[34:39] but is under tutors and governors until
[34:41] the time appointed of the
[34:51] father so Paul here is telling us that a
[34:56] child that is born in a family
[34:59] he has no difference with a
[35:02] servant yet he is
[35:05] theable the son of the
[35:07] father but why is he considered as he is
[35:10] not yet his as as much as the servant
[35:13] why is he considered like
[35:16] that because the trait of the
[35:21] fathered in this
[35:23] sun Paul says that until the time
[35:26] appointed
[35:27] when the father has designated specific
[35:31] tutors and
[35:32] govern to this son
[35:36] here until this child reflect the same
[35:40] trait of the
[35:43] Father the same character of the
[35:46] Father the same value of the
[35:50] Father the father will come
[35:54] publicly and say this is my son
[36:00] him
[36:01] today that he can run all my
[36:06] functions my
[36:08] duties praise the name of the Lord so as
[36:12] long as the son does not have the gene
[36:14] of the father or the trait of the
[36:18] father can't be declared
[36:21] publicly I hope you following me friends
[36:25] amen he say
[36:27] in the message
[36:30] here when a boy was
[36:33] born that boy was was his was his son by
[36:39] birth but yet that son did not fall hair
[36:42] to everything until he became of age and
[36:45] the father tested his
[36:54] character praise the name of the Lord
[36:57] son couldn't inherit
[37:00] everything until his character was
[37:04] tested it is the same as the
[37:07] fathers and then he continues and says
[37:10] now in the Old
[37:12] Testament when this baby boy was
[37:15] born father hired a
[37:18] tutor a teacher a
[37:21] rer and to get this
[37:25] rer many of you know the galatian
[37:30] letter Paul writing like to
[37:34] us in this picking out the
[37:38] [Music]
[37:40] thisor the father picked out the best
[37:43] man that he could find for the
[37:48] job because he was certainly interested
[37:50] in his
[37:55] child and any fathers
[37:58] any father any father is that way that's
[38:01] a real
[38:03] father that's just the love of a parent
[38:06] to her
[38:09] child and his father went around and
[38:11] found the bestor that could raise his
[38:18] son could bring up his
[38:24] son educate son
[38:27] and teach his son to follow his Father's
[38:34] Footsteps and this
[38:36] tutor was to bring message to the father
[38:39] how the child was
[38:41] progressing and this tutor was to bring
[38:45] message to the
[38:46] father how the child was
[38:49] progressing now all that was a type of
[38:52] the church
[38:53] today for when God brought us into his
[38:56] kingdom by of the Holy Ghost and become
[39:00] a child of God God sent us the bestor
[39:04] but there was in all Heaven the Holy
[39:08] Spirit he is to Nature and to bring up
[39:12] and to raise and to teach the church
[39:15] brother we need the Holy Spirit
[39:19] and this the prophet says that the tutor
[39:23] is the Holy Spirit and the purpose of
[39:26] the tutor to bring the character of the
[39:28] father in
[39:30] you the father you know
[39:34] be so he gives you the holy spirit for
[39:37] the Holy Spirit to take charge of
[39:39] everything in your
[39:40] world not you it is the spirit of God
[39:44] that is teaching that is tutoring and
[39:47] the key that you need in your
[39:49] Lifey what the tutor
[39:53] tell as as you son disobey Judah will
[39:58] not take you to the
[40:00] Father the examination because the
[40:02] prophet has told us Jud rather the
[40:05] father had to test the CH the character
[40:09] was his own prise the name of the Lord
[40:12] so value we are talking about the sa
[40:18] Value SA that's we can say the Divine
[40:21] value
[40:29] praise the name of the Lord so the
[40:33] value that we are talking about is what
[40:37] the prophet is referring to as the
[40:39] character every child of God must get
[40:44] these sacred
[40:46] values life for him to walk daily praise
[40:50] the name of the Lord so we see that the
[40:53] J's role was to bring the perfect value
[40:57] of the father in this
[40:59] boy without that the father couldn't
[41:02] publicly declare the
[41:04] son Lord it wasn't the sun chice of who
[41:07] the tutor
[41:09] is today people want to have their own
[41:13] choice about the
[41:17] tutor as long as I'm a religious that's
[41:20] what I need a Christian must receive the
[41:24] tutor that comes from
[41:25] God spirit and once you reject the Holy
[41:29] Spirit praise the name of the Lord
[41:32] before you even receive the spirit you
[41:34] must receive the word of God believe it
[41:38] so when you believe the word of God when
[41:40] go you know the Paul says Paul says that
[41:46] once you believe the word of God is
[41:50] obligation the Holy Spirit it is not
[41:52] when you believe but after you believe
[41:56] God gives you the the holy to you to
[42:00] bring out the G bring out the
[42:04] character of God in
[42:07] you so L of
[42:10] that there no public
[42:13] declaration the sa values so the Jud was
[42:17] identified by the
[42:18] father and the had full authority of the
[42:21] over the
[42:23] son it is not saying that God is that
[42:26] Jesus Christ is my
[42:29] Lord is not training in your body he has
[42:33] to be your lord and has full authority
[42:36] over
[42:36] you whatever he wants in your life you
[42:41] see not to see that you know on
[42:43] Sunday I'm anointed I'm inspired I'm a
[42:48] Christian on Tuesday on Wednesday THS
[42:53] you are not that that's not what this
[42:55] son was a true Son of
[42:59] God accept the tutor to do the work
[43:03] daily there was no
[43:05] public every other
[43:08] day was on duty son was in the
[43:12] field what the
[43:14] fathered the
[43:16] TR praise the name of the Lord so we see
[43:19] here obedience the was all the son
[43:24] needed toing the father's values
[43:28] praise the name of the Lord so we must
[43:30] accept to go through child
[43:33] training we must accept to go through
[43:36] child
[43:37] training his reflecting
[43:40] image right in us his fullness praise
[43:45] the name of the Lord total surrender
[43:48] theor that's what brought the
[43:51] value son here want you love to
[43:54] surrender the Holy Spirit want you love
[43:56] to surrender the
[43:57] TR may bring out his own
[44:00] virtue you let's turn to the book of
[44:04] First Peter
[44:06] here and make this a little bit
[44:11] clear brother second pter
[44:16] one he says in
[44:18] verse according as his divine
[44:21] power has given unto us all things
[44:27] that pertaineth unto life and
[44:31] godliness through through the knowledge
[44:34] of him that has called
[44:38] us to glory and
[44:40] virtue now he says according as his
[44:44] divine
[44:45] power divine
[44:47] power the power that Christ talked about
[44:52] inse
[44:54] receive when the truth has come in and
[44:57] what does this tror do he brings down
[45:00] the
[45:01] Vues praise the name of the Lord and he
[45:04] says in verse four whereby are given
[45:06] unto us exceedingly great and precious
[45:11] promises be partakers of the divine
[45:15] nature having es the corruption that is
[45:18] in the
[45:25] world and then he say
[45:28] and besides this giving all
[45:33] diligence
[45:37] [Music]
[45:42] giving to your add to your
[45:50] faue knowledge and to knowledge
[45:55] Temperance and temperance
[45:59] patience to
[46:04] patience brotherly

[46:10] kindness all this it is not your work it
[46:14] is the work that you can manest if you
[46:20] obey praise the name of the Lord that is
[46:23] the Divine
[46:24] values that God wants to see
[46:28] you see and he
[46:32] verse for if these things be in
[46:36] [Music]
[46:39] you they have to be in you
[46:42] and not just to be in you but they don't
[46:46] have effect they must abound they must
[46:50] do
[46:51] something and then he says they make you
[46:54] that you shall neither be baren
[47:01] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[47:04] Christ he that La these
[47:07] things is blind and cannot see a
[47:12] far have this virtues here says you
[47:15] can't be
[47:16] Buren the fruit of the
[47:19] spirit the fruit in it due season
[47:23] because the vacu that
[47:30] of the Son of God Is Right In you let's
[47:35] look another
[47:38] here in the book of
[47:41] Galatians
[47:43] 5 here says in verse
[47:46] 22 but the spirit of but the fruit of
[47:49] the spirit is
[47:51] love joy peace long suffering gentleness
[47:57] goodness
[48:00] faithness
[48:02] Temperance
[48:03] SE there is no so this all
[48:08] together second
[48:12] verse and this Gans
[48:15] 5
[48:16] verse2 the prophet tells us that these
[48:20] are the
[48:27] head of the
[48:28] woman that she searched
[48:31] for praise the name of the Lord let's
[48:34] pick up that
[48:35] scripture and then we you know we get
[48:37] down into our
[48:39] subject he says in Luke 15:8 where we
[48:42] read
[48:47] first either what man either what
[48:50] woman having 10 pieces Luke 15
[48:57] either what woman having 10 pieces of
[49:00] silver if she lose one piece does not
[49:03] light a candle and sweep the house and
[49:06] seek diligently till she find
[49:22] it praise the name of the Lord so this
[49:25] woman
[49:27] had 10
[49:29] tablets in her head she lost
[49:33] one when she knew the husband is coming
[49:36] back had to sweep
[49:39] the at night she couldn't risk her
[49:44] husband to come
[49:45] back she doesn't have
[49:48] the praise the name of the Lord and like
[49:51] any other woman you know what trait your
[49:54] husband loves most
[49:58] we we spoke here with
[50:00] brother that as you're going to Mar for
[50:04] a
[50:05] specificate you look for for a
[50:10] specific this that you're looking for is
[50:13] not something that is going to perish
[50:18] tomorrow that is
[50:21] Everlasting that will not let you go
[50:23] into hell
[50:26] that means
[50:28] Holiness that is true praise the name of
[50:31] the Lord so when people are telling you
[50:35] when people are telling you look for a
[50:38] character friend man is character man is
[50:42] character of you see that someone may
[50:46] tell
[50:47] you she has
[50:49] Le she has a piece of land you can go
[50:53] for her that's of it own another will
[50:57] tell you she has money you will not
[51:02] suffer that's another
[51:04] tra but a Son of
[51:06] God we look for that
[51:12] value not going
[51:15] away that
[51:17] value you
[51:19] back God and every woman knows that this
[51:24] is the
[51:25] character
[51:29] hband knows that once I
[51:32] lost is as much as I've lost him my
[51:36] husband wants to see this
[51:39] display the Lord with his church he
[51:42] wants to see that character that tra
[51:46] that we have talked about reflected in
[51:49] his
[51:50] church in
[51:52] his every day not only on Sunday
[51:56] is in the second coming of the Lord it
[52:00] say it is late than we think we don't
[52:03] come to
[52:04] church few we do not come to church to
[52:09] hear a good sermon or come to church to
[52:12] hear good music they all got their
[52:16] place the of but what we better come to
[52:20] church to
[52:21] do take up with God our soul salv
[52:28] the day of redemption is
[52:30] near say Jesus Christ son like this he
[52:35] said to a
[52:38] woman in our subject tonight we find
[52:40] this
[52:42] woman her
[52:43] husband had gone and she had lost one of
[52:47] the
[52:48] coins out of her
[52:52] taet and he says here in paragraph 56
[52:57] today if a woman is
[53:00] married she should wear a wedding
[53:03] GRE saying that she's
[53:05] married that is to keep other men
[53:09] from they look and they see she's
[53:14] marri in those days they didn't have
[53:17] wedding
[53:18] rinks they had a
[53:21] tablet they put on their head it had 10
[53:25] coins
[53:27] and it went around their head and that
[53:30] was as saying they were a married
[53:33] woman and no man was to fool with them
[53:37] nobody was to flatter with them they
[53:40] married praise the name of the Lord and
[53:42] he continues down and say it was placed
[53:45] in there and each que meant a certain
[53:49] Vue of that
[53:52] woman and he says the first meaning her
[53:56] love to her
[53:58] husband second her pledge of Vue to to
[54:02] live clean for
[54:07] him and
[54:09] theth see the prophet is trying to
[54:14] expl and says that all these
[54:17] tablets each had a
[54:20] meaning and then says the first one was
[54:23] her love to
[54:24] husband she lose the love of
[54:29] husband the second one The Virtue to
[54:32] live clean for him the and that's why
[54:36] this woman let's continue here in
[54:40] paragraph
[54:41] 59 he says if you want to look it up
[54:45] look in Galatians 5 you find out that
[54:48] that woman represented the church and
[54:51] the church is an Expos wife to Christ
[54:54] the that the church is a to we
[55:00] found the name of the Lord where we read
[55:03] the spirit talking about love joy peace
[55:08] long suffering gentleness goodness the
[55:12] prophet says this is theet of the of
[55:17] Jesus
[55:19] Christ that's the tablet that's supposed
[55:22] to be wor in the church
[55:26] he go to Second Peter chapter 1 and he
[55:29] say Brotherly
[55:31] Love fellowship and this woman must have
[55:34] been long about that that she realized
[55:37] that she had lost one of those
[55:42] qus but when she realized the prophet
[55:45] says that it has been it must have been
[55:47] a little bit longer it must have been
[55:51] dark and then it says in paragraph
[55:54] 61 if there ever was a
[55:57] time the church to take inventory to
[56:01] find out if you've got all the
[56:05] co to find out whe love is there you
[56:10] have that
[56:13] of the Fai is there the word of
[56:18] God
[56:19] abah thought the of sah was
[56:22] there said it's going to be
[56:27] praise the name of Lord and the prophet
[56:30] says this is the time that we should
[56:33] examine ourselves and find out is Joy
[56:37] there patience there gentl there
[56:42] goodness there weakness there Temperance
[56:46] there are youing them in your
[56:49] season
[56:51] inventory the is at hand Prophet says
[56:55] here it should be now it's getting
[56:59] dark the veil HS and clouds of
[57:02] destroying civilization is hanging
[57:07] over
[57:09] immorality on every hand we are living
[57:12] in a tremendous time when there is
[57:14] wickedness people who go to
[57:17] church
[57:18] sh sh means when they not meaning it
[57:22] they come to church but is for a
[57:24] formality
[57:26] people who go to church try to hide from
[57:29] their
[57:32] meanness they have lost a certain
[57:35] taet a certain vum to cover it up they
[57:40] don't come to you know to examine
[57:42] themselves but they come to hat it
[57:46] praise the name of the Lord and the
[57:48] prophet continues and say people who go
[57:50] to church and profess
[57:52] Christianity live like the rest of the
[57:54] world
[57:56] smoking
[57:58] gambling dress
[58:00] dressed wearing clothes that they ought
[58:03] not wear their own dressing room out of
[58:07] the streets before the public and
[58:10] brother Brotherly Love is a thing that
[58:13] is
[58:15] passing praise the the name of the Lord
[58:18] we have to take
[58:20] inventory you see
[58:24] the this woman
[58:26] woman she
[58:29] realized how did she know because maybe
[58:32] she lost it in the morning but she
[58:34] wasn't taking
[58:36] inventory going through oh is it there
[58:41] is it there is it there we' go to take
[58:45] event that the
[58:48] Val beone you see and then he says here
[58:53] in paragraph 62
[58:56] was getting
[58:57] night and remember her husband would
[59:01] return found her one of those que out it
[59:06] showed she had been marked a
[59:09] hot and if she
[59:12] had
[59:14] filed and it was seen by the
[59:17] people they brought her before the
[59:21] priest and brought witness that she had
[59:24] been found such
[59:27] and the priest seen that she was
[59:32] married took the
[59:34] que out of her
[59:37] tablet that she had been doing
[59:40] wrong praise the name of the Lord so the
[59:43] prophet is telling us
[59:44] here that if one was
[59:47] out she had to be taken to the
[59:50] priest you know there's a
[59:55] scripture in the book of Galatians
[59:57] chapter
[1:00:01] 3 it says in verse
[1:00:06] 27 for as
[1:00:09] many as for as many of you as have been
[1:00:13] baptized into Christ have put on
[1:00:17] Christ Galatians chapter 3
[1:00:28] praise the name of the Lord now Paul is
[1:00:30] telling us as long as you were baptized
[1:00:34] in
[1:00:36] Christ not being baptized in a certain
[1:00:40] religion being baptized in
[1:00:44] Christ you see the scripture can't be
[1:00:47] broken you have to put on Christ how do
[1:00:52] you put on
[1:00:53] Christ by putting on the Vues
[1:00:56] by putting on his
[1:00:58] tra he
[1:01:00] said he that believeth on me the same
[1:01:03] work that I did shall do also so when
[1:01:06] you are baptized in Christ Christ
[1:01:10] himself comes and be your
[1:01:13] dress comes and be your dressing
[1:01:18] we comes and be reflected on you that
[1:01:21] whoever looks at you sees Christ praise
[1:01:25] the name of the Lord
[1:01:26] because you have been baptized into
[1:01:28] Christ when you baptized
[1:01:32] into is a religion that's why the
[1:01:35] prophet
[1:01:36] says people and ask them are you
[1:01:39] Christian and they say no I'm a Catholic
[1:01:43] why they were baptized into
[1:01:46] the this
[1:01:47] evening you have been baptized in Christ
[1:01:51] you will put on that Christ and that's
[1:01:54] what the prophet is telling
[1:01:57] this woman she had to look for the for
[1:02:00] the tablet and when that tablet was not
[1:02:04] F to the priest told her and told him
[1:02:09] she has lost it and when the husband
[1:02:12] came found that she didn't have that
[1:02:14] taet the husband was free to put her
[1:02:17] away praise the name of the Lord and
[1:02:20] that is anonymous to the foolish virgin
[1:02:23] where the scpt says that when the
[1:02:26] bridegroom came and they didn't have the
[1:02:29] wife praise the name of the Lord I want
[1:02:32] to Tye that this evening one of the
[1:02:35] values with one of the tablets when the
[1:02:38] bridegroom comes and he doesn't find it
[1:02:42] there we shouldn't stand there the
[1:02:50] prophet in paragraph
[1:02:52] 65 the church better examines
[1:02:59] by the word of God
[1:03:02] our
[1:03:04] our our devotion will become
[1:03:10] T
[1:03:12] tar cigarette
[1:03:16] smokers pained up
[1:03:18] jeel everything in the calendar that
[1:03:21] that the rest of the world
[1:03:23] does Christian Church is associating in
[1:03:27] those things
[1:03:29] today till you can't hardil one from the
[1:03:34] other time we took
[1:03:37] eventually it is getting light praise
[1:03:40] the name of the Lord this is the time
[1:03:43] that we should take
[1:03:45] eventually because this kind of a thing
[1:03:48] where we can associate ourselves with
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:51] world until you can't
[1:03:54] differentiate from

[1:04:31] ug like the rest of the people out we
[1:04:34] are born from heaven we are born from

[1:06:06] Fanatics not for some emotion
[1:06:09] work not for a jump for
[1:06:11] joy but for a heart
[1:06:15] searching you see a heart searching
[1:06:19] experience when
[1:06:21] men and women get right with
[1:06:24] God see the proph say it's not about the
[1:06:28] excitement it's not about you know the
[1:06:31] emotion that's not what she did wasting
[1:06:34] the gospel
[1:06:37] handle examining yourself right in the
[1:06:41] word not using another a standard coming
[1:06:45] to Christ himself as the standard and
[1:06:48] say what have I to do to get better back
[1:06:52] in the land the Propet said she had to
[1:06:55] late
[1:06:57] goel to search for to search for that
[1:07:01] tablet it says in paragraph
[1:07:04] 6 I see time is running

[1:07:41] come and if he called
[1:07:43] her with that one Co out she was
[1:07:48] a brother with the Church of the Living
[1:07:52] God great hours that we are leaving
[1:07:56] it behoves us to check up go before God
[1:08:01] let the CLE of the word of the and
[1:08:04] examine ourselves and find out if we are
[1:08:07] not falling short and especially when we
[1:08:10] see all these things
[1:08:13] coming we are at the end time the coming
[1:08:17] of Christ is at hand there is not
[1:08:19] another hope in the world for the church
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:26] husband is about to come and in the
[1:08:30] scripture Jesus said blessed is
[1:08:35] that when
[1:08:40] come what staying in
[1:08:43] service prise the name of the Lord
[1:08:46] bearing the fruit of the spirit seeing
[1:08:49] that if I lose this tablet
[1:08:51] here I search for it until I restor back
[1:08:56] when I lose this tablet of Joy
[1:08:59] here for it until I
[1:09:01] get event all the time examine yourself
[1:09:05] all the time praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:09] to be certain that the building block
[1:09:12] of present right in your soul you see
[1:09:17] because it is easy to walk out a
[1:09:20] m and you leave Brotherly Love somewhere
[1:09:25] to walk a long distance and yet you have
[1:09:29] L that's the same characteristic that
[1:09:31] was in the Ephesian Church
[1:09:35] age they had lost
[1:09:37] something Jesus came and rebuked
[1:09:41] them go back to where you where you
[1:09:45] were you must find that
[1:09:48] first in and that's what I'm meaning
[1:09:52] this when I talk about examining
[1:09:54] ourselves
[1:09:55] we may get back that sacred
[1:09:58] value that is missing right within us so

[1:10:25] he say man is not
[1:10:27] measured by how much his biceps are how
[1:10:32] much his biceps
[1:10:35] are praise the name of the Lord how big
[1:10:39] a muscle he
[1:10:40] is is measured by his
[1:10:43] character that's exactly
[1:10:46] right and
[1:10:48] character comes from the word of
[1:10:52] God that alone and the real
[1:10:55] sent of
[1:10:57] God looks for the
[1:10:59] character of the Vindicated

[1:17:37] it and that's how all through the church
[1:17:41] ages that's how they lost it by
[1:17:45] compromising you see because of their
[1:17:48] own
[1:17:49] benefits you see

[1:29:55] father give me more and is giving you
[1:29:59] that water becomes a well inside
[1:30:02] of begins to flow it is Flowing is not
[1:30:07] flowing
[1:30:09] hatred it is not flowing you know issues
[1:30:13] of the
[1:30:14] world flowing the
[1:30:18] values flowing the fruit of the spirit
[1:30:22] is Flowing the same
[1:30:25] that water he has not said that when I
[1:30:28] give you this water the water that will
[1:30:31] flow out of you be of a different nature
[1:30:35] the same water that Christ giv is that
[1:30:39] water you give out praise the name of

[1:30:46] says unto him sir give me this water
[1:30:48] that I thirst not neither come to drw
[1:31:04] so we see that the scriptures never
[1:31:06] F
[1:31:08] person any person that takes of this
[1:31:13] water by all
[1:31:16] means must become
[1:31:21] aware you see
[1:31:24] because Jesus
[1:31:26] Christ cannot
[1:31:29] lie I hope we are together he says You
[1:31:32] must be a well springing
[1:31:42] everlas and in verse
[1:31:45] 37 in the last day in the last day that
[1:31:50] great day of the
[1:31:52] feast Jesus stood cried say If any man
[1:31:57] thirst let him come unto me and drink he
[1:32:01] that believeth on as the scripture has
[1:32:05] said out of his
[1:32:08] belly shall rivers of Living
[1:32:12] Water any person that believeth on
[1:32:15] Christ any person that comes and drink
[1:32:19] out of him there is a river flowing and
[1:32:27] theal supp to the nearby
[1:32:30] people are you supplying to the near
[1:32:33] people are you supplying to your
[1:32:35] neighbors are you supplying to your
[1:32:37] colleagues at work are you supplying to
[1:32:39] your colleagues at school are you a
[1:32:42] river are you a well the word has been
[1:32:46] broken which cannot be so the prophet
[1:32:50] says here I asked my wife not long
[1:32:54] ago I said I want to ask you
[1:32:58] something what is real true value placed
[1:33:08] on
[1:33:10] nothing but L
[1:33:12] soul is the only thing that got value in
[1:33:19] it praise the name of the Lord Brother
[1:33:23] my sister
[1:33:25] after receiving
[1:33:29] Christ something that is of Great
[1:33:33] Value I hope my brother can get this
[1:33:36] here you canp nothing but
[1:33:45] l so the prophet tells us after
[1:33:50] receiving
[1:33:51] Christ we bear
[1:33:54] the sacred
[1:33:57] values that he has referred to as
[1:34:02] theet and every morning we to examine
[1:34:06] ourselves to be sure that none is
[1:34:10] L praise the name of the Lord because
[1:34:13] that is the
[1:34:15] trait that is the character that God
[1:34:18] wants to see in you
[1:34:21] daily praise the name of the Lord now
[1:34:23] he's telling us that after receiving
[1:34:27] Christ you bear the sacred
[1:34:30] values something that is more
[1:34:34] valuable you know than you buying
[1:34:38] land than you you know whatever you do
[1:34:41] in
[1:34:42] life whatsoever you do in life he says
[1:34:46] there is
[1:34:47] nothing that is so
[1:34:50] valuable that lost his
[1:34:52] SCE that's what we should go for because
[1:34:56] that's what we should do we are rivers
[1:35:00] of Living
[1:35:01] Water
[1:35:03] dist you see yes got let's
[1:35:07] continue nothing
[1:35:11] but is the only thing that is got value
[1:35:14] in
[1:35:17] it money passes away homes DEC and
[1:35:23] everything in the
[1:35:25] Earth the only value lasting value
[1:35:30] rather have one so in
[1:35:33] glory that I want to Christ to know and
[1:35:36] see that the light of
[1:35:38] God around that Soul through all
[1:35:42] eternity to be associated with that to
[1:35:46] have every pen of the
[1:35:49] money because I have to lose it
[1:35:54] friend that's the
[1:35:56] value that's the
[1:35:58] value as the as the living water is
[1:36:01] Flowing it should be able to out to a
[1:36:08] brother not not like the Levites that
[1:36:11] passed that man that that had
[1:36:15] fallen the
[1:36:19] Jero you see you have your brother you
[1:36:24] have your friends you have your
[1:36:25] colleages
[1:36:27] at
[1:36:29] neighbors but look at what they testify
[1:36:31] about
[1:36:32] you praise the name of the Lord yet you
[1:36:36] are put there by God for
[1:36:41] purpose you see the prophet says my
[1:36:46] brother sister tonight without hope
[1:36:51] without God that's why
[1:36:54] I am here to speak to you to try to get
[1:36:57] you to love the Lord Jesus I want to
[1:37:00] some of his blessed
[1:37:02] word and then he says he continues
[1:37:05] another
[1:37:06] message he says one so
[1:37:11] saved when that star is a shining
[1:37:15] y our name will be wrapped
[1:37:20] into is your value
[1:37:24] have you got any value
[1:37:26] there that should be our
[1:37:29] anchor know that there is a
[1:37:32] glory my name
[1:37:34] ised because anything that we do down
[1:37:37] here we are certainly going to leave but
[1:37:40] that so there you're going to go with it
[1:37:44] that's a testimony that will be seen
[1:37:47] there as the scripture say that they
[1:37:50] will be
[1:37:51] shining as the brightness
[1:37:54] the STS
[1:37:57] they that they
[1:37:59] W he says here there is your value it
[1:38:04] isn't how much you got how much you
[1:38:07] desire it is how much you can do toward
[1:38:10] saving
[1:38:13] sses our money will
[1:38:17] Fed I'm
[1:38:20] certain I'm certain that every one of us
[1:38:24] every morning we look out
[1:38:27] for
[1:38:29] to you see that but how discouraging it
[1:38:34] is know that when we cross
[1:38:36] over that we are going to leave
[1:38:39] here me right I'm not saying that don't
[1:38:44] work Paul says and the scripture
[1:38:48] says he that he without
[1:38:52] sewing you will not
[1:38:54] e he that doesn't work shall not eat so
[1:38:59] we must work for us to eat but if we are
[1:39:03] working this body that is going to Decay
[1:39:07] how much should we
[1:39:10] work our names will be
[1:39:12] rupted glory he continues and says now
[1:39:17] the prophet here down he gives an
[1:39:19] example of his
[1:39:21] car and he say in paragraph
[1:39:24] 33 I polished that little old F he was
[1:39:28] he was he was he was talking about his
[1:39:30] old his F
[1:39:32] his I that
[1:39:37] old brother anyway you just continue
[1:39:41] where we were says I polished that
[1:39:44] little old
[1:39:46] f i
[1:39:52] Pol this morning setting up there in the
[1:39:59] gar and then he says brother he says I
[1:40:02] polish that
[1:40:05] old and then he says and this morning
[1:40:09] setting up there in the gar is aadl that
[1:40:14] they have given
[1:40:16] me he was talking about
[1:40:19] two he polished the old
[1:40:22] f he was talking about the
[1:40:25] cadl he had been given and then he
[1:40:29] says and setting up there in the G is a
[1:40:35] that they gave me but one of these days
[1:40:39] that will be like the
[1:40:44] is it will be no more but God will still
[1:40:49] be the
[1:40:50] same if I get a soul saved for Christ
[1:40:54] brother as long as there is an eternity
[1:40:57] the glory of God will rest on that
[1:41:01] s so what's value
[1:41:04] any what good does it
[1:41:06] do when the struggles is in your

[1:42:10] work and all your AAS and all your
[1:42:14] motives praise the name of the Lord I
[1:42:16] just want to end with one quote
[1:42:19] here I pray you forgive me for for
[1:42:21] keeping you this long
[1:42:23] he says in the message
[1:42:25] investment the Bible say thou Rich Thou
[1:42:30] Art Rich Thou Art rich and increased in
[1:42:35] Goods to this stage to this
[1:42:38] age he was talking to this
[1:42:41] age but don't know that you are
[1:42:44] naked
[1:42:46] miserable poor wretched blind and don't
[1:42:51] know it what a miserable
[1:42:55] condition he talking about the people
[1:42:59] that stand in the feet of the
[1:43:03] Pharisees and they say we Are
[1:43:07] Holy we are
[1:43:09] righteous we don't need
[1:43:12] Phan you see they say we are rich the
[1:43:17] scripture is saying you say that you are
[1:43:21] rich you increased with Goods
[1:43:24] but you don't know you are naked you are
[1:43:28] miserable
[1:43:31] poored and he says what a miserable
[1:43:34] condition and you know the prophet says
[1:43:37] the reason it was such a
[1:43:40] miserable because they didn't know their
[1:43:43] condition but happy are you know that
[1:43:46] the nature the you know the nature of
[1:43:49] the age
[1:43:50] today standing there but yet we who have
[1:43:55] realized that we
[1:43:57] need the weight
[1:44:00] rment that we need the
[1:44:05] iel we are here to receive SE from
[1:44:09] the how happy are you the prophet
[1:44:12] continues and
[1:44:14] says men and
[1:44:16] Brethren don't make an investment in
[1:44:19] something like
[1:44:22] that is bound to
[1:44:24] perish you
[1:44:27] see he continues and say why not make an
[1:44:31] invest an investment in something that
[1:44:33] is proved Through the
[1:44:37] Bible and you know with the text that I
[1:44:40] got written
[1:44:42] here here tonight still this text
[1:44:45] proving Through the
[1:44:47] Bible those who made that and who turned
[1:44:50] it down
[1:44:53] and then he say here I am showing you a
[1:44:56] real
[1:44:59] investment and I want to say this I'm
[1:45:02] showing you a real
[1:45:07] value that will look at you and say my
[1:45:10] son is wor praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:14] he says I am showing you a real
[1:45:17] investment to make put your
[1:45:21] life you are
[1:45:24] your money your talent put everything
[1:45:27] you've got in Christ God guaranted it to
[1:45:33] us by raising him up again we will
[1:45:37] raising the last
[1:45:38] today promised what more could you look
[1:45:42] forward to he's asking you tell me any
[1:45:46] investment you make that would pay off
[1:45:50] like that show me one
[1:45:53] you see not any all the Investments that
[1:45:57] we make
[1:45:58] down we are to leave them
[1:46:01] here it's not bad to have them brother
[1:46:05] it's not bad to have them
[1:46:09] brother we must have them and I want to
[1:46:12] tell you you must work
[1:46:15] to but yet there is a more
[1:46:20] excellent
[1:46:21] investment that's what the prophet is
[1:46:24] showing then he says tell me what you
[1:46:27] invest in this morning and make $10
[1:46:31] million and tomor be
[1:46:33] a what what good would it do
[1:46:37] you you see that's the same thing that
[1:46:40] happened to the Rich Young lul after
[1:46:42] reting eternal life he went and made
[1:46:46] businesses and indeed he he was a big
[1:46:49] businessman but after the biggest
[1:46:52] Harvest ever had in his
[1:46:55] life that same night he was
[1:46:58] aose and the prophet says what would it
[1:47:02] profit
[1:47:03] you friends we've got to take inventory
[1:47:08] we' got to examine
[1:47:09] our where are we putting most of our
[1:47:13] investment in the Kingdom or in this one
[1:47:16] here you see we must know where True
[1:47:21] Value is
[1:47:23] say one night he asked his wife where is
[1:47:27] True
[1:47:29] Value he preached the word he stood in
[1:47:33] Services he had had all that he wanted
[1:47:36] all that he ever wanted lay hand on it
[1:47:40] but yet was asking where is
[1:47:43] true friends it would be bad if we hear
[1:47:48] this word here and then we fa to
[1:47:50] recognize the the
[1:47:54] prophet as I try to wind
[1:47:56] up what good will it be what Pro a
[1:48:01] man the whole world his value but if you
[1:48:06] popular and so and so so and
[1:48:12] soor Doctor Bishop Elder pop or whatever
[1:48:18] you might be those are prizes of men
[1:48:23] brother be called a
[1:48:24] Holy by the people and be a Son of God
[1:48:29] in my heart with the new birth the
[1:48:32] spirit of Christ dwelling in me and him
[1:48:36] proving it by the Vindication of his
[1:48:39] wife and making me live the life that I
[1:48:43] once lived I you know he says and make
[1:48:45] me live the life that I once lived I
[1:48:49] don't live no more
[1:48:52] and yet he was a teacher scholar but he
[1:48:56] changed his life when he met Christ and
[1:49:00] made his
[1:49:02] inv in he was a different man from then
[1:49:07] on brother sister my prayer is from this
