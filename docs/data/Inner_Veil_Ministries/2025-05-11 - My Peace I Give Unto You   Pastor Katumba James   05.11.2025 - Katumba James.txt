Father, how we are thankful aren't you Lord Jesus for the opportunity you've given unto us Lord that we [music] can come into your presence Lord and how you told us in your word that where two or three are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord you are you are here with us father may therefore speak [music] to us father the words of peace the [music] words of eternal life that we can find joy in your presence. Lord, may you release us from all troubles, from all worries, from all situations of [music] life that put us down that you may revive us again, heavenly father, and that your will may be done in our lives. Bless this service, heavenly father. Grant to hear everyone's heart's desire, Lord. and [music] grant your goodness upon every one of us even upon many who are not able to come to the Lord. We lift them also into your hands that your grace may reach unto them [music] far even those who are streaming heavenly father. We also commit them with your hands that your grace may reach unto them far and bless us all together for the grow of your holy name. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray and ask [music] this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [music] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles in the book of John chapter 14 and then we're reading from verse 26 to verse 28. Amen. Amen. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I live with you. My peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let your peace, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. You've heard how I said unto you, I go away and come again unto you. If you love me, you would rejoice because I said I go unto my father for my father is greater than I. of his word. So I want to speak on the subject. My peace I give to you. Praise the name of our Lord. You know we are living in days where we have a lot of troubles. There are many stresses that come. There are many uncertainties that come. There are so many things that you know you find yourself you're going through. You start the day well in the course of the day you find trouble complete uncertainity. You know the Bible says according to the scriptures we are living in perilious times. And you know when you look at illustration of a perilious time the Bible says people shall be lovers of themselves. People shall be covenant breakers. People shall be only thinking about themselves nothing else. In the book of 2 Timothy chapter 3 and then in verse one &gt;&gt; the Bible says this know also that in the last days perilious times shall come. And then he describes what brings the perilious times. Dangerous days, trouble days. Why? Because people shall be lovers of their own selves. You know they last after this, after this. They just not contented with anything. like now you get some of the villages, you get a rich man with a lot of money. He's owning a lot of land, but he wants to put the road to land through somebody's small land and they can afford to do the service, do the titles and then he fences it. Then he goes to the local authorities. You have to plan for me road. And then you get a poor person's house is all being swept out to create a road for the rich man. You know, no care, no concern about what your neighbor is going through. Like in some of these places which are here, somebody can build well his house. make sure that his water from his place goes through your your compound. And he said also you take care of the water can afford but the other one cannot afford but maybe wants this man to run away. And then there are others he can afford to buy the whole village. For if you are refused and you're in the middle you off perilious days. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says boasters, proud, blamers, disobedient to parents, unthankful. [snorts] Regardless of what you do, just all the time murmuring, complaining, finding an excuse, finding something to criticize, finding something, you know, to to kind of rub rub off somebody or brush them off, you know. Then he says unholy without natural affection. You know they they don't have any feeling for anybody. It's all about them and if it's not about them should be none else. Praise the name of our Lord that we are living in. And then he says trust breakers, you know, false accusers, &gt;&gt; incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. These are the days we are living in. So then you find that trouble is everywhere. At home you may find trouble and if you are in a home where the husband and the wife don't relate at all travel at home maybe one goes to work and by come time coming home you are afraid. I don't know what they are going to choose me for. or they ask maybe they're going to ask me where have you been of all the good things there is only one mistake and one picks that mistake troubled lives we are living in such days like it was in the days of Noah the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah The Bible says in the days of Noah, people were violent. You know, they were imagining evil all the time, not concerned about the things of God, you know, just criticizing, maybe backbiting and all those kind of things as it was in the days of Lot. You know people only concerned about their interests. Praise the name of the Lord. We are living in this kind of days. But even in the midst of living in such times of uncertaintity, when the Lord Jesus was leaving, he told his disciples, "My peace I give to you. Praise the name of our Lord. In such times that we are living in, what we need is the peace of God. And let the peace of God be real in your life, not something you pretend about, you know, just something you try to form, you know, something that's not real. When the peace of God comes, it can come when you are even very sick. Everybody is saying you are going, you are going that peace holds you so firm. When everybody becomes hopeless, praise the name of our Lord, peace comes. Praise the name of our Lord. You may be locked up in prison. And then the peace of God just lures in your life. You know the peace of God has no bounds is not held by any circumstance or stration. He said my peace I give you. Let your heart be not troubled. We can go and look at John 16:33. The Bible says, "These things have I spoken unto you that you might have peace." Now, he's saying, "I'm speaking to you the word and the word that I'm speaking to you will give you peace." Praise the name of our Lord. It's also important for us. We have the word of God in our hearts. We have the word of God in your heart. And he said, &gt;&gt; I give you my peace. So he says, I've spoken you these things that you might have peace. Now you see the contrast here in the world. You shall have tribulation. Now he said in the world you're going to have tribulation you know but I have spoken to you my word that my peace may be in you. So even in prison you can have the peace of God. Even in sickness you can have the peace of God. Even when you are poor, praise the name of our Lord, you have the peace of God. So it is not dictated by circumstances you are going through. And you know the peace of God comes because God himself is right there with you in that condition. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message to shall we go? Brother Brennham says, "If you ever got real peace, you've got Jesus. If you haven't got Jesus, you don't know even know what peace means until you come to him. I've seen people kings, &gt;&gt; great men, athletes, movie stars and all that. They are not peaceful. They can have the authority. They can have the money. They can have everything they want to have. Because peace comes from the prince of peace and if you don't have the prince of peace then you can't have peace. So then he says look at them watch their eyes a few minutes they are neurotics. See, no man, no woman, no child, no one can have peace outside of Jesus Christ. My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, not as the world gives peace, but he has eternal peace, a resting peace. Praise the name of our Lord. Even when you are sick, there is that peace that keeps you calm. Praise the name of the Lord. Even when you don't have money in your pocket, that peace that keeps you calm, even when you don't have a job, that peace that keeps you calm. Praise the name of the Lord. Even when the troubles around you are just so severe, there is the peace of God that holds you. So then he says, if you live, if you die, no matter if the rain comes or the sun shines, you have got peace anyhow. Praise the name of Lord. We need to have the peace of God that flows like a river. Praise the name of the Lord. Keep flowing. Keeps you going. Praise the name of the Lord. Somebody else may look at your condition with you. Look at that one. Why is he laughing? If he doesn't have anything, but there is the peace of God that surpasses all of us. Praise the name of the Lord. He makes you peaceful. He holds you sober. Praise the name of our Lord. Whether it rains shines, you have that peace. Praise the name of the Lord. Now the Bible says how the Lord will keep us in perfect peace. In the book of Isaiah chapter 26. Praise the name of our Lord. Isaiah chapter 26. And then we can read in in verse three. He says, "Though will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, &gt;&gt; because he trusts in you. Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength." Praise the name of our Lord. So he says if you keep your mind you know you are trusting in him you are thinking about his goodness you appreciating him for even that he has done it says he will keep you in perfect peace and that's what we need to do in the trouble days that we are living in some of the things are not going the way you think they should maybe their businesses and they are failing. But the people don't have God. When they make a loss, &gt;&gt; they think that's the end of everything and they can commit suicide. But now for you, you will know I have one who is greater than all the things I'm praise the name of our Lord. He will keep you in perfect peace. You keep your mind, you keep your mind on God. You keep on thinking about the goodness of the Lord. Praise the Lord. Thanking the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. There is a book I read. Praise the name of our Lord. I think it was 50 years in the church of Rome or something like that. There was a man, he was actually a criminal. And so that man there, they arrested him. Whether he was a murder, so they put him in prison. And when they put him in prison, during the time he was in prison, he got saved. And now because he was a murderer, he was meant to be killed. But then the person who witnessed to him went and pleaded with the king that was in one of the European countries there. So now he pleaded with him that please let this man not be killed. he has become better. So what the king had to do was to make sure that this criminal should be transferred to Australia because that's we're taking criminals and so they took him to Australia Australia but you know because he had been born again his conduct &gt;&gt; was completely pleasing to the prison wers whatever they would tell him he would do after picking this or this but he was so good to them until when he was in Australia they gave them to go and work and keep on working with all his heart doing whatever he would until the prison wers said this man is not worth to be in prison. He's a very good man. Then there they made him free as a citizen of the country. So he said, &gt;&gt; so there was mining on the coast of Australia. &gt;&gt; Yes, they were mining gold. But then for him go there try to look for whatever he would do in his mind all the time he was just praising God. His mind was always on God. He said one day he went to the sea. And when he was at the sea, he saw something glittering. And when he reached out, &gt;&gt; he went and found a big a big mold of gold. And that time whatever you get becomes yours. He got it and he was able to become one of the richest citizens in that country. But the whole thing was to accept Christ as your personal savior. God delivered him from sin and even delivered him from the natural prison. Praise the name of our Lord. We can learn to keep our mind on God. You know, regardless of the condition that you are going, maybe you have people at place of work who are against you. But what does the Bible say? Pray for them. Don't wish them evil. When you follow the word of God, the peace of God comes down. If you have issues against anybody, the Bible says forgive them. If you don't forgive them, then you are living under torment. So you cannot have the peace of God. You see, if you follow the word of God the way the word of God tells us to do, the peace of God will always come down. Somewhere the Bible says, if they smite on this side, he also don't smite back, but turn and they smite this side. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible has told us he will keep you in perfect peace if your mind is stayed on God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms 119 and verse 165 and then verse 165. The scripture says, "Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. Praise the name of our Lord. You get great peace when you love the Lord, when you delight in the word of God because the word is God himself. So you really want to be obedient to all the way the word is telling you. The Bible says you have great peace. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And nothing shall offend you. &gt;&gt; So then we need to see that we are obedient to the word of God and then the peace of God will always keep you stable. come as if nothing is taking place because the prince of peace is right inside of you. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to see that the peace of God you know is always in our lives. Praise the name of our Lord. Don't allow things contrary to the word. see that you are obedient to the word of God. Follow what the word tells us to do. Praise the name of the Lord. That the peace of God may always be in us. Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the message against to whom shall we go, he says he is the only eternal happiness. and joy and peace. What more could I say? It is the only eternal joy, eternal happiness, eternal peace. My peace I give to you, not as the world give. Let not your heart be troubled. It is the only peace and only happiness. Praise the name of our Lord. So you just see that you hold him. Praise the name of our Lord. Just for him to be right inside of you. He says you might laugh like a loan. You might just go into hysterics over some movie star cracking a joke or something, &gt;&gt; you know, like, okay, now you see like we have this, we have these kind of, you know, people who try to make some kind of, you know, drama actors. I'm just forgetting the name like we have and others comedians you know people go and laugh you laugh so much but it can't bring you peace so you go and put on the joke like now Tik Tok you can go to one stream and you are on Tik Tok laughing the all day. Like some of them go to drink to have some kind of forget their troubles but the tr after drinking again you get back to the same person drugs you know. So the comedians can make you can crack jokes then you are laughing all the time. You can you can laugh when they are cracking a joke or something. But what is it? You are only making a noise. It soon wears off. You know, it's not eternal. There's no peace in it. In a few minutes, it's all gone. But when a man has come to a place where he has found the joy that there is of knowing that his sins are forgiven that he is dead and his life is hid in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost joy unspeakable. and full of glory in the power of the eternal God, knowing that you are resting satur in his love and grace. Whether the school keeps or whether it doesn't, what difference does it make? Praise the name of. So God alone gives us that true peace and you know that true peace comes when you read in Romans chapter 5. The Bible says &gt;&gt; that being therefore justified. Romans 5:1. &gt;&gt; Okay. We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. So if you want that peace of Christ, Accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior. Let him take away all your past sins. Be obedient to the word of God. Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Then the spirit of God himself will come into you and will bring that peace. My peace I give unto you. &gt;&gt; Christ himself coming in our lives. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message the minist I know he says Jesus might have said now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again. That's what he does when he gives you new birth. Your old life is gone and you are back to the original word of the Lord. If you are not, you are hybrid into churches, denominations. But when God speaks, he speaks and the Holy Ghost, then you are back in the original family of God. You don't have to be baby. You are a rugged Christian who can stand it. Praise the name of our Lord. This is where the challenge we can now be faced. Because we all go through trials. We go all through temptation. We go through testings. As children of God, we have to go through these things. We've got to go through them. When Christ himself is inside of you when Christ is not there, you fight along the way. You know, you'll give up. You'll say, "But this not what I expected. But he allows patience to come in our life to mold our character. Praise the name of our Lord. When you have Christ inside of you, he says you go to the cross and to the cross was not something which was pleasant. It was sorrow. It was hardship. You go to the fairy furnace. It was not, you know, some refreshing thing which was there. It was fire. Praise the name of our Lord. It was a lion's den. It was not a picnic there. Praise the name of our Lord. whatever it may be because the word of the living God burning in your heart and your soul and all can backslide all can turn against you and everything else but that won't stop one thing that rugged word of God right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart. You are mine. Praise the name of the Lord. These are the consolations that we need. Where do I stand? Is Christ with me or I'm pretending that is not is you are certain. So now when the storms come, you know for sure and now when they were in the ship, you know, and then the storm was coming and the Bible says the wind was so strong and Jesus was in the back of the ship resting. And then for them there was the water was full in the ship. to awake him. You don't care that we perish. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, in the midst of the storm, &gt;&gt; Jesus told the storm, "Peace be still." Praise the name of our Lord. That's what we need in our lives. Sometimes you're going through a terrible storm in your house. You know, you're going through a terrible storm at your place of work. You are going through a terrible storm in your life. You just need the prince of peace to come to that. Peace be still. Praise the name of our Lord. But you know sometimes the storms come to clean you. Praise the name of the Lord. That's what happens. You know the storms come to make sure that the lake is clean, pushes the dirt all away. Praise the name of the Lord. You know there's no dust on water, [laughter] you know this garbage cans, the rubbish, broken things, and then the storm just comes. and then he pushes them outside and so when the storm comes you can learn how to pray. You know you are putting off those kind of fun lifestyle you've been doing. When the storm comes some of those friends who are not right can keep on going away start speaking bad about such that the codes are cut. You know the links you have with them are cut off. You know sometimes the lifestyle which is not pleasant, the storm just comes and this one is cut off. Maybe you are the person who used to spend a lot of evening with your friends in a bar. Now it comes you don't have money to go there. So you have enough time to go back home. storms come to clean us to put the house in order and when you call upon the prince then you've learned how to pray. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to see that we have the peace of God in our life and let that peace lure in you. Praise the name of our Lord. In the book of Ephesians chapter 5, rather in Ephesians 2:14, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "For he is our peace." Ephesians chapter 2:14, who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us. Praise the name of our Lord. He says Christ is our peace. When he is inside of your life, he comes with his peace. He said my peace I give unto you as the world gives. So his peace you know comes and takes over in whatever condition that you are living in. So it's not it doesn't matter whether you in the lion is den of God like Daniel when he was thrown in the lion is den he was so calm. Praise the name of our Lord. He started running around shouting shouting around but he was so calm and he trusted in the Lord. And then Daniel said God has sent his angel and then the angel stopped the lion from doing any harm to Daniel. Praise the name of Lord. The four the three Hebrew children they were thrown in the fire. The son of man himself came down you know putting away the fire from doing them any harm. And that's what the peace of God does. Regardless of the condition we are going through, regardless of the situation that we are going through, his peace remains. Praise the name of Lord. And that should always be your desire. Every day you live. Sometimes things may not be working out the way you expected. Just have that peace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. Regardless of what you're going through, just see that you have the peace of God in you. Praise the name of our Lord. Colossians 3:15. Colossians 3:15. It says, "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be thankful. Praise the name of our Lord. So he says that peace of God should rule, should govern. Praise the name of the Lord, should be taking charge, you know, the charge of the house, charge of the heart, praise the name of our Lord. Every decision you do, you do it after the peace of God. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, you do things based on what will the Lord Jesus Christ do. You know, you seek peace and then you follow it, you pursue it, you make peace. Praise the name of our Lord. People who are troubled, you're not going to start them how they can be totally different from one another. You know they are fighting and so when they are fighting you want to increase their fight peace maker to try to calm down the situation. Praise the name of our Lord because you have the peace. So you can only make peace when you have the peace. So he says that peace should lure in our hearts. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how we are called, you know, that we can be in one body and always be thankful. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Philippians chapter 4. Philippians chapter 4. Philippians &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse six. The Bible says, "Be careful for nothing in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. Let your requests be made known to God." Praise the name of God. He said, "Be careful for nothing." So now if you are not going to be careful for said make your request known to God. Put your troubles before God. Lord this is what I'm going through. Lord this is the situation I'm faced with. Lord come down to my station. I know as you keep on waiting on the Lord. He gives you the grace. Praise the name of our Lord to see that you are able to overcome the situation that you are going through. Mind is stabilized. Praise the name of Lord. And then he said, "And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Praise the name of our Lord. If there anybody troubled, the Bible is telling us, put it before the Lord in prayer. Praise the name of our Lord. Bring it to the Lord. talk to God about it. This is what I'm going through. This is what I'm going. This is the trouble I have. This is the need I have. But when you put it before the Lord, you are trusting him that he's going to handle that. You keep on believing God. You keep on depending upon God. Praise the name of our Lord. You don't become panicky. I don't know whether the Lord is going to do this. Put it before him. He says, "And the peace of God passes all understanding keep your hearts and mind through Christ Jesus." But you see what the devil does, he always want to show your trouble. He want you to think about your travel something negative. But the Bible says in verse eight that whatever things are true, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are lovely, Whatsoever things of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, you think on the things. Stop thinking about the negative. Stop thinking about your failure. Stop thinking that I don't think I'm lucky. you know, maybe I was cast, the family I was born in, that's not good. &gt;&gt; So, where do you think about it? So, start thinking about things that are true, to the promises of God in the situation you are going through, thinking about that, meditating about that. Praise the name of our Lord. One day brother Brham was was was meditating upon Joseph and then he said how a good character Joseph was he thought about Joseph. Now when he kept on thinking about Joseph then the Holy Spirit told him you're going to bear a son and you're going to call him Joseph. Praise the name of our Lord. Positive thinking. When you are sick, don't allow the negative mind this one I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Be positive thinking. You know, think right. Think about something which is glorious. There's no glory in death. Praise the name of our Lord. So you think about something that will bring glory to the Lord. Think about victory. Think about your healing. Think about your overcoming. You know, you think about things that are good, things that are pure, things that can bring glory to the name of the Lord. Don't go to the negative things. You know, my family Think about something which is true. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And then the Bible says with that he will keep you in perfect peace. Praise the name of our Lord. And what we need is his peace. His only peace. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message communion he says there is something about water something about refreshing. My point was to get the water when you are thirsty is something it does to you to get the water when you are thirsty. Now he said, "My peace I leave unto you. My peace I give you." &gt;&gt; Not as the world gives peace, but the way he gives you peace. His peace quenches our thirst. Praise the name of our Lord. If we are longing for peace, then let us refresh in his peace to know that we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. He is our peace giver that quenches our thirst. Praise the name of See that you have the peace of God and the peace of God will keep you secure in every circumstance. It doesn't matter what you are going through. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us finish with Psalms 91 and then verse one. He says, &gt;&gt; "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. Now the thing is am I dwelling under the secret place of God? So if I'm under the secret place of the almighty God and that means that God is in my life. Then you have a confession that the Lord is my refuge and my fortress. My God in whom will I trust. So now you have God in you. The peace of God is there. The peace of God is there. The Bible says he will deliver you from the snares of the faller and from the noisome pestilence. Praise the name of our Lord you because he's right inside there. He takes charge over your security. Then he shall cover you with his feathers. and under his wings you shall trust. His truth shall be your shield and buckler. Then he said you not going to be afraid by the terror at night. You know thieves are coming. You can't even sleep at night. You just say Lord I commit my security into your hands. nor the arrow that flies by day. Like nowadays they don't use arrows, they use bullets and during day time you not see the bullet even those bullets I'm not going to be afraid. Praise the name of our Lord for the pest that walks in darkness. pestilence that walks in darkness like we had corona people afraid to touch surfaces even talking with somebody you fear going close to them moves where you can't tell but he says even that pestless that walks in darkness, the Lord protects you. Praise the name of our Lord. A destruction that waits at noon day. Then he says, "A thousand shall fall by thy side and 10,000 by the right hand." But it shall not come near you. Praise the name of our Lord. What a promise we have. So you can start asking yourself, how many have fallen around you? Have you been able to count 10,000? One by one. You find that even in our villages, we can't make those people. So by the time it reaches you say even 10,000 1,000 why there is the protection of God he keeps around his children. Praise the name of our Lord. He keeps them secure the way he protected Job. That's how the Lord protects us. Praise the name of our Lord under his protection. We should have that confidence. The Lord will watch over me. The Lord will take care of me. The Lord will deliver me. The Lord will make me successful. The Lord will make me finish this journey. You are not looking at your abilities. If you're putting your trust in God, praise the name of our Lord. He says, "Only with thine eyes, verse 8, shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked because you have made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high, your habitation. Therefore shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling place. Do you believe this? Amen. You take it. Lord, I believe this. And then you take it before the Lord in prayer. Maybe you're hearing troubles in the community where you live. Lord, this is your promise. You have promised this. You've promised this. Praise the name of our Lord. And so you believe the Lord that he's going to perform his word for you. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Psalms 46. And then verse one, the Bible says, "God is our refuge. a very present help in trouble. He said is very present. So once trouble comes know that he's already present. Tell it to Jesus. Talk to him about it. Lord there's this kind of condition. Lord there's this kind of stretch because he says he's very present when the trouble is there. That's one thing you should be sure when you see the trouble. Let it awaken you that God is present. Just be aware that God is present in whatever challenge you go through in life. Whatever you go through in life, just call upon the name of the Lord. So the Bible says, "Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be removed, though the mountains be carried in the middle of So the Bible says we shall not fear even if the earth you know you are standing on this ground and then the ground goes away from where you are standing the Bible says we shall not fear. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says heaven and earth will pass away. So when the earth is passing away and the heaven is passing away, where will you be? Praise the name of our Lord. So be in the word all the time. The word will give you a firm base to stand your God. If it requires you to stand in the air, If he requires you to stand in the air, you'll stand in the air. If he requires you to be on the water, stand on the water. Praise the name of Lord. So then he says, let the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea. Let the wonders be there offer and be troubled. Just translate direct. Though the waters thereof roar and be trled, though the mountains shake with the straining they are. Praise the name, your confidence is in God. Let God be your peace. Praise the name of our peace of God completely l in our lives. And when you have peace, live in peace. Give peace to others in the name of our Lord, not troubles, not funny things, peace, live in peace, minister peace, and see that you give out peace to others. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "My peace I give to you. And he has given us his peace. Praise the name of our Lord. And every day regardless of what we are going through, let the peace of God remain in our lives. Praise the name of our Lord. May God bless you. Amen.
