[18:58] pastor
[19:00] for once again granting me the
[19:03] grace and
[19:04] opportunity to speak to you
[19:08] amen and now we want to appreciate God
[19:10] for the
[19:12] word and I want to say
[19:15] something that the devil has tried to
[19:17] fight here and
[19:19] there and just a few minutes before
[19:22] coming here my laptop
[19:27] crushed and I lost my
[19:30] not but I'm trusting the Lord for the
[19:33] grace so we pray with me maybe it's what
[19:37] God wanted us to have
[19:39] tonight amen so as I preach intered
[19:43] together with
[19:44] me that the mind of
[19:47] God may be spoken to
[19:49] you amen so let's turn to the Book of
[19:56] Genesis and read out verse 9
[20:02] amen and the Lord said unto Cain where
[20:06] is Abel thy brother and he said I know
[20:09] not and I am I My Brother's Keeper
[20:24] M and he said what hast thou done The
[20:28] Voice voice of thy brother's blood cth
[20:32] unto me from the
[20:41] ground and now thou cast from the earth
[20:45] which hasth opened her mouth to receive
[20:48] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[21:05] let's also turn to Hebrews 12 verse
[21:15] 22 but you are come unto Mount Zion and
[21:19] unto the city of the Living God the
[21:22] heavenly Jerusalem and to an inable
[21:24] company of angels
[21:36] assembly and the Church of the firstborn
[21:39] which are written in heaven andto God
[21:41] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[21:44] of just men made perfect
[22:04] unto Jesus the mediator of the new the
[22:07] New Covenant unto the blood of
[22:10] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[22:13] than that of
[22:15] [Music]
[22:22] Abel see that he refuse not him that
[22:25] speaketh for if they escap not who who
[22:28] refused him that spake on Earth much
[22:31] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[22:34] from him that speaketh from heaven
[23:03] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[23:06] he has promised saying yet once more I
[23:09] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[23:29] may the Lord bless his
[23:31] word we may get
[23:33] seated
[23:36] amen I want to
[23:39] speak on the expressed thoughts of
[23:44] God and the blood
[23:47] speaks amen so we have picked it from
[23:50] The Book of
[23:53] Genesis chapter four where God spoke to
[23:56] Cain
[23:59] after K had killed AB his
[24:03] brother and now when God spoke to
[24:06] him said I've heard the voice of your
[24:09] brother's
[24:12] blood crying unto me from the
[24:16] ground praise the Lord so God had the
[24:19] blood of of of Abel
[24:23] crying so there was a voice that was
[24:25] coming from the blood of Abel
[24:30] praise the Lord and in Hebrews
[24:33] 12 the Bible has told us in verse
[24:38] 24 that now we have Jesus
[24:42] Christ the mediator
[24:46] Newen to the blood of
[24:50] sprinkling praise the Lord that speaks
[24:53] better things than that of Abel
[24:58] in the old
[24:59] test the blood
[25:02] of was speaking to God it was crying out
[25:06] to God after Cain had slain
[25:09] him praise the Lord and now here in
[25:13] Hebrews says we have come to Jesus
[25:17] Christ who is the
[25:19] mediator and now he also said and we are
[25:22] also come to the blood of
[25:26] sprinkling that speaks better
[25:30] things praise the Living God so now the
[25:33] blood
[25:34] speaks and when it speaks the blood of
[25:38] Christ speaks better
[25:40] things the blood of ab the blood of
[25:44] Christ speaks
[25:46] healing our souls it speaks healing of
[25:50] our body it speaks
[25:53] strength our weak vessels it speaks
[25:57] power to our hearts the blood of Christ
[26:02] speaks and when it speaks it speaks
[26:05] better
[26:07] things that
[26:08] of Praise the Lord now visiting Exodus
[26:14] 12 where God gave
[26:17] Moses the blood as a token for
[26:20] salvation by which the households of the
[26:23] children of
[26:24] Israel would be saved
[26:28] praise the Lord they would be saved from
[26:30] the death
[26:37] plague hit the land that night we know
[26:41] that night of
[26:43] the praise the L we know that night when
[26:46] when the death
[26:48] angel was going to visit the
[26:52] C was going to visit the land of
[26:55] Egypt because when God sent out Moses
[26:58] to go and deliver the people he gave him
[27:02] signs praise the Lord and he told him if
[27:05] they refuse the first one they may not
[27:07] refuse the second one if they refuse the
[27:10] second one not refuse the sign of the
[27:13] token of
[27:14] blood and now it came to pass that
[27:17] Pharaoh had completely
[27:20] refused to let go of children of
[27:23] Israel and yet God was
[27:26] determined that he had deliver his
[27:29] people to go to a land that he had
[27:32] appointed of them for one purpose to
[27:35] worship Him Praise the Lord and now here
[27:39] in the book of Exodus
[27:42] 12 God gave instructions to
[27:45] Moses and he told him to go and take the
[27:48] word the children of
[27:50] Israel and he told Let each household
[27:54] that come that has the ability
[27:58] get praise the Lord they had to get a
[28:01] lamb and then they slaughter it and
[28:05] apply blood upon
[28:07] the because the death was going
[28:11] night and the only way they would be
[28:15] Sav blood upon
[28:18] l so now the blood praise the lord we
[28:22] notice that that
[28:24] blood was
[28:26] applied spoke salvation
[28:29] to the people that were within that
[28:32] house so when the death angel came
[28:35] around and he saw the blood praise the
[28:38] Lord the people in there
[28:41] were so it was a token for their
[28:44] salvation praise the Lord so he passed
[28:47] over that house and the people
[28:51] were spoke salvation it spoke victory
[28:55] over
[28:56] death to that applied the
[28:59] token and now God spoke to
[29:02] Cain after the death of his brother
[29:05] saying the voice of your
[29:09] brother voice of the blood of your
[29:12] brother out to me from the
[29:15] earth praise the Lord and you know
[29:18] according the Bible the Bible says that
[29:21] the
[29:22] life of any
[29:24] being the life of any creature
[29:28] that has blood the life of that
[29:31] creature is in the
[29:33] blood the Lord And now when God said to
[29:37] to
[29:38] Cain the blood of your the
[29:41] voice of the blood of your brother cries
[29:43] out to me so now the life of
[29:47] Abel was in that blood praise the Lord
[29:52] now here the Bible has told
[29:54] us when we are come when we have been
[29:57] called
[29:59] come unto Heavenly
[30:01] places and unto Jesus
[30:04] Christ who is the
[30:06] mediator of the New
[30:09] Covenant praise the Lord and his
[30:12] blood speaks better
[30:15] things praise the Lord and I want to say
[30:18] this that now we know like we' been
[30:21] having at this series with the last
[30:24] Services about the expressed thoughts of
[30:27] God
[30:28] the Bible tells us that the Lamb of
[30:32] God was slain before the foundation of
[30:36] the
[30:37] world praise the Lord so and I want to
[30:39] say this that God when he saw the
[30:44] perversion when he saw how Satan was to
[30:48] pervert he saw how Satan was going to
[30:51] pervert his original
[30:53] creation
[30:56] Heise Lord saw it coming and so before
[31:00] the world was
[31:03] laid he had in his mind he got himself a
[31:08] lamb in his thoughts and then he killed
[31:12] this
[31:13] lamb praise the Lord and he got this
[31:16] blood and he put it upon the Altar for
[31:19] atonement of our
[31:21] sins but that was before the foundation
[31:24] of the
[31:25] world praise the Lord now when he laid
[31:29] it upon there we know that the lamb that
[31:34] talks about is Jesus Christ because John
[31:39] when he was baptizing and he saw Jesus
[31:42] coming he says Behold the Lamb of
[31:46] God takes Away The Sins Of
[31:49] Man praise the Lord now that was the
[31:52] Lamb of God that was in the mind of God
[31:56] and God had got himself
[31:58] L he killed it for one purpose that the
[32:03] blood of that
[32:05] lamb shed upon every
[32:08] sinner cleanse every sinner and save
[32:12] them from their
[32:13] sin so now I want to say this that what
[32:17] God did God got his life and he got his
[32:21] life and put his life in
[32:24] islamise the Lord and so when he got
[32:27] this his and put in the
[32:29] lamb that means the life of
[32:32] God in the blood of this
[32:35] lamb when he killed it and put it upon
[32:38] the Altar for
[32:40] us that means it is not the blood of the
[32:43] lamb but it is the life of of God
[32:46] himself in the
[32:48] lamb is the life of God himself in the
[32:51] blood of the
[32:52] lamb praise the Lord that is here
[32:55] atoning for our sins
[32:58] that's why the Bible says that we are
[33:00] also come to the blood of
[33:03] sprinkling which speaks better things
[33:06] than that of
[33:07] Abel praise the Lord and the Bible says
[33:10] in
[33:11] Leviticus let me take you back to uh to
[33:13] the Book of Leviticus in the Old
[33:15] Testament chapter
[33:17] 17 we are trying to lay a
[33:20] foundation for the expressed thoughts of
[33:24] God and now we have got it that the mind
[33:28] of God he had the thought before the
[33:32] foundation of the
[33:34] world that he would lay a
[33:37] lamb and then he offered it in
[33:41] his before it was even made
[33:45] manifest in his thought he thought
[33:50] about he he thought about the
[33:53] fall he thought about his people he
[33:56] thought about his
[33:58] seed he was
[34:00] determined to save his seed by all
[34:05] means that's why in his thoughts he now
[34:09] laid a
[34:10] lamb for the sacrifice of our
[34:13] s now even before we
[34:16] sin God had thought of a
[34:20] plan praise the Lord to help us get
[34:24] reconciled back to
[34:26] him even before you
[34:28] sin God thought of a way of bringing you
[34:32] back to
[34:33] himself even before you were born God
[34:37] thought
[34:38] about his thought and he thought of
[34:42] how help us
[34:44] overcome the TRS of the world when we
[34:48] got when we get born into the
[34:50] world that's why hiss he laid the lamb
[34:55] and offered it for
[34:58] sins before he committed them praise the
[35:01] Lord and now the Bible
[35:04] says
[35:06] andever and whatsoever man there be the
[35:09] book of lus 17:
[35:13] 10 and whatsoever man there be of the of
[35:16] of the House of Israel or of the
[35:18] strangers that so among you that eth any
[35:22] manner of blood I will even set my face
[35:26] against that so and that eateth blood
[35:30] and will cut him off from among his
[35:32] people
[35:49] [Music]
[35:58] for the life of the flesh is in the
[36:02] blood and have given it to you upon the
[36:07] altar to make an atonement for your
[36:12] souls is the blood that makes an Aton
[36:18] soul that was the old
[36:21] T praise the Lord thousands of
[36:24] years before Jesus Christ came
[36:28] praise the Lord and remember it started
[36:31] with
[36:32] God in his thoughts praise the Lord and
[36:36] now he got the
[36:38] atonement he got the
[36:40] sacrifice in his and he offered praise
[36:45] the Lord now when the world was
[36:48] created and man fell now God put
[36:52] Shadows he put shadows and he commanded
[36:56] his people
[36:58] if a man SS let him bring a bulock let
[37:02] him bring a lamb and let him offer it
[37:05] for
[37:06] his all those were
[37:09] Shadows of the thought that God
[37:13] had for atonement of our
[37:16] sins even before the world was
[37:19] created and he said it is the
[37:22] blood and I have given you this
[37:24] blood for atonement for for your
[37:29] soul it is the
[37:31] blood that makes an
[37:33] atonement for the soul praise the Lord
[37:37] is the blood that that
[37:41] beds for the soul it is the blood that
[37:45] speaks on our
[37:47] behalf before God for our forgiveness of
[37:51] sins it is the blood that
[37:55] presents our petitions
[37:58] before God praise the Lord and so now it
[38:01] through the blood that we approach God
[38:05] our atonement and he says I play it upon
[38:09] your for your atonement because it is
[38:13] that blood that makes the atonement for
[38:16] your
[38:17] soul and now like I said that this blood
[38:22] which is a
[38:23] shadow now when the true sacrifice came
[38:29] when the Lamb of God
[38:31] came praise the Lord to
[38:34] express that which was in the throat of
[38:37] God before the creation of the
[38:40] world when he came prise the Lord it was
[38:44] not an
[38:45] animal praise the Lord but now God had
[38:49] gotten himself
[38:50] [Applause]
[38:51] alone which was his own
[38:54] son praise the Lord so he got his own
[38:57] son
[38:57] son and made him
[39:00] alone why because he had to be
[39:04] obedient he had to be
[39:06] lowely the Lord so he likened
[39:10] him nature of the
[39:12] Lamb PR the Lord because he had to
[39:16] execute the instructions of the father
[39:20] he had to
[39:21] execute the The Works of the Father the
[39:25] purpose that God had created
[39:28] so now he brings him down and he offers
[39:31] him upon the cross for the atonement of
[39:34] our sins and now we know that that Lamb
[39:38] of God was actually God
[39:42] himself who
[39:44] condescended praise the Lord who left
[39:47] his throne who left his glor who left
[39:51] his power praise the Lord and then he
[39:55] condescended and then he came down and
[39:58] offered himself as a lamb for our
[40:02] sins why because he had tried all
[40:05] Avenue he had sent
[40:08] prophets praise the Lord and he had
[40:11] failed he had sent so many people had
[40:15] failed given us the Ten
[40:17] Commandments by which we would
[40:20] live our bodies were weak that we fell
[40:24] short of
[40:25] them until he thought thought about his
[40:30] expression he thought about his
[40:33] thoughts which he had before the
[40:35] foundation and he said now is the
[40:39] time praise the Lord And now when the
[40:41] time was come about 4,000
[40:45] years about 4,000 years after the
[40:49] foundation of the world was
[40:51] laid he now comes down as the Lamb of
[40:56] God that takes Away The Sins Of Man
[41:00] praise the Lord but does not mean that
[41:03] our sins were
[41:05] remitted our sins were forgiven at the
[41:10] time when Jesus upon the
[41:12] cross our sins were remitted our sins
[41:17] were forgiven even before the world
[41:20] was why because the B clearly
[41:23] states that this lamb
[41:27] L before the foundation of the
[41:30] world God thought about you God thought
[41:34] about you before the foundation of the
[41:37] world Lord so now we are here today we
[41:41] believe the word today because we are
[41:43] the
[41:44] manifestation of the thoughts of
[41:48] God we believe the word today the
[41:51] message today because God ordained it
[41:55] praise the Lord and he claimed us he got
[41:59] us praise the Lord himself even before
[42:03] we were
[42:04] born praise the Lord so how did you
[42:08] believe praise the lord it's God himself
[42:11] that called you praise the Lord because
[42:14] he called you even before you were
[42:18] born the Lamb of God that takes the s of
[42:23] praise the Living God that's what John
[42:25] says John vers
[42:28] 29 he saw him and remember John was a
[42:34] prophet praise the Lord so and a prophet
[42:38] would get into the mind of God know the
[42:41] thoughts of God bring the thoughts of
[42:44] God to the people praise the Lord so
[42:48] when John saw him he saw him and
[42:51] recognized him and say sure this is the
[42:56] Lamb of God
[42:58] has come to take away the sins of people
[43:01] and he said this is he of whom I said
[43:06] after me cometh a
[43:08] man which is prepared before
[43:12] me for he was before
[43:16] me praise the Lord he was a prophet John
[43:20] was a prophet and he says Jesus was
[43:25] before
[43:26] him for sure we know that
[43:29] John was born before
[43:31] Jesus praise the Lord but because he was
[43:34] a proph he had gone the
[43:37] inspiration he got the
[43:39] inspiration and he had got the mind of
[43:42] God he went ahead of time and God took
[43:46] him before time and he was able to see
[43:51] the lamb that would be offered for our
[43:55] sins and when he saw him
[43:57] he never said behold the Holy One or
[44:01] behold the right but he said perfect he
[44:06] called him the Lamb of
[44:08] God because surely he was the Lamb of
[44:12] God praise the Lord because the life of
[44:15] God was in Him Praise the Lord And now
[44:19] when he died upon the
[44:21] cross blood there was blood it bled when
[44:27] blood was
[44:28] bleeding that blood which was
[44:32] bleeding is actually the
[44:35] blood of God
[44:37] himself and in that blood the B has told
[44:41] us that the life of the
[44:45] flesh is in the blood so in the life of
[44:49] Jesus Christ the life of God was in that
[44:54] blood that was bleeding
[44:57] out of Calvary and now the Bible says
[45:01] that God got this blood and put it upon
[45:04] the
[45:05] alt for as an atonement for our souls
[45:09] and then he also says it is that same
[45:13] blood that makes the
[45:15] atonement for our souls it makes
[45:19] atonement for our sins it is the blood
[45:22] of Jesus Christ the life of God
[45:25] himself praise the Living God and the
[45:29] prophet says blood speaks does the blood
[45:33] speak can it
[45:35] speak that token
[45:37] speaks yes sir we would look back to
[45:42] Genesis the voice of the blood of
[45:45] Abel cried out against
[45:48] Cain praise the Lord and he say we also
[45:51] find it in Hebrews that the blood of
[45:54] Jesus Christ speaks better
[45:58] things blood
[46:00] speaks but how can the chemistry
[46:05] speak praise the Lord how can the
[46:08] elements of blood
[46:11] speak praise the Lord it is the life
[46:15] that is in the
[46:17] blood that th the
[46:19] speaking praise the Lord is the life
[46:24] that is in the blood and now we are
[46:26] talking about the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:30] so it is the life in the blood of Jesus
[46:34] Christ that
[46:35] speaks praise the Lord what does it
[46:38] speak we shall see that the soul that
[46:41] was in
[46:42] Cain oh in Abel it was the life that was
[46:46] in
[46:47] Christ that cries out better
[46:50] things it speaks
[46:52] loud and what is that
[46:55] life we know
[46:57] that all that God was he Ed it into
[47:01] Jesus
[47:02] Christ the lord so if it's the blood of
[47:06] Jesus
[47:06] Christ that was laid upon the altar our
[47:11] atonement it means it's the life of
[47:14] God this is the life of God is the holy
[47:19] spirit praise the Lord it is the holy
[47:21] spirit that Aton for your sins because
[47:25] that is the life
[47:27] that is in the blood praise the Lord
[47:30] that atones for
[47:32] our that atones for our
[47:34] weakness that beli before God for
[47:37] forgiveness and the reason the blood was
[47:40] put there was to prepare
[47:43] us
[47:45] remember even before Jesus was
[47:48] crucified God had had that plan before
[47:53] so now this blood that is laid here
[47:57] is is is L to prepare us to prepare the
[48:02] bright every day to cleanse the bright
[48:06] every day to sanctify the bride every
[48:10] day why because the purpose of God is to
[48:14] have a bright that has no spot that has
[48:19] no ring so now he gets himself his blood
[48:23] his blood and he lays it here and he
[48:26] says blood is now here it has the power
[48:30] to forgive it has the power to cleanse
[48:33] it has the power to wash so each time
[48:36] you get that you remember that the blood
[48:39] was given upon the altar then you run
[48:41] the blood I said father I am here I am
[48:45] that cleans me because that is the
[48:48] purpose the blood was laid upon you
[48:51] praise the Lord the blood was given to
[48:55] prepare the bride
[48:57] for the Rapture the blood was given to
[49:01] cleanse our
[49:03] garments our garments must be
[49:06] white our robes must be
[49:09] white we must portray
[49:12] righteousness praise the Lord so the
[49:15] blood is still there praise the Lord and
[49:18] as long as we are here blood shall be
[49:22] there praise the Lord the blood of Jesus
[49:25] Christ speak better things speaks
[49:29] righteous of to the
[49:32] Brokenhearted it speaks praise the Lord
[49:35] to the weak it speaks strength to the
[49:39] Fallen it speaks strength the blood of J
[49:43] Christ
[49:44] speak praise the Lord and he says
[49:47] believe for
[49:48] yourself and apply the token also for
[49:52] the
[49:53] family like they did in Egypt
[49:57] like they did in
[49:59] Egypt and like they did at
[50:02] Jero find out Paul told the
[50:07] Romans to be baptized that's
[50:11] 16 calling upon the name of the
[50:14] Lord him and his
[50:16] house could be saved by doing the same
[50:20] thing move out some people want to apply
[50:24] the
[50:25] blood and stay in
[50:27] you apply the blood and kick all the
[50:30] trash out of the
[50:33] house and have a house Cleansing
[50:37] Time look then when you realize and
[50:42] present the
[50:43] token of the blood the life it took for
[50:47] the
[50:48] token the blood speaks for us remember
[50:54] the Covenant blood
[50:57] was recognized with a
[50:59] token and the word assures
[51:01] us of the promise the token is the
[51:09] sign that the purchase is made for
[51:14] us praise the Lord that's what the
[51:17] prophet says he says apply the
[51:19] token apply the blood because the blood
[51:23] is here you apply it was
[51:27] quoting praise the Lord the Roman he
[51:30] says
[51:32] when when when Paul was speaking to him
[51:36] he asked him to apply the
[51:38] token to take Jesus Christ to accept the
[51:43] sacrifice accept the blood and then he
[51:47] said when you accept it apply it also to
[51:50] your
[51:52] household apply to your children apply
[51:55] to all your people in other words take
[51:59] the token to your children present it to
[52:03] them show them the truth show them the
[52:06] words praise the Lord present them to
[52:09] the
[52:10] Token present them before the
[52:12] blood praise the Lord and he says they
[52:15] shall all be
[52:16] saved praise the Living God that's it
[52:21] praise the Lord he said it out in
[52:24] Genesis the blood of Abel spoke
[52:28] praise the Lord and says the Abel the
[52:31] blood of your
[52:33] brother
[52:34] speaking it is crying the life of your
[52:38] brother is crying out what has happened
[52:42] to him and the blood of Jesus is
[52:46] speaking the blood of Christ is crying
[52:50] out praise the Lord he's crying out to
[52:53] every sinner he's crying out to every
[52:55] one of us the blood of Christ is
[52:59] speaking to us every day he speaks to us
[53:02] through the word he speaks to us through
[53:04] the message he speaks us through the
[53:07] preachers he speaks to us through the
[53:10] teaching of the word BL is crying out
[53:14] come out of her praise the Lord he's
[53:17] crying out every day is preparing the
[53:20] bride for the Rapture the blood of Jesus
[53:24] Christ speaks better
[53:27] things praise the Living God yes sir
[53:30] that's what he says in the message the
[53:33] infalible
[53:35] proof of the
[53:37] Resurrection he says we are taught in
[53:40] the Bible that Jesus was the lamb slain
[53:44] from the foundation of the world we
[53:47] understand that he wasn't
[53:49] slain he wasn't slain really until 4,000
[53:54] years later
[54:00] but when God spoke the word it was a
[54:03] finished
[54:04] work God spoke
[54:07] it praise the Lord and he says he was
[54:10] slain back
[54:12] here at the foundation of the
[54:15] world when God for saw and knew what he
[54:19] would
[54:20] do he spoke the words and it was
[54:23] finished right
[54:25] there it was a spoken word and it was
[54:29] finished right
[54:30] there praise the Lord and we know that
[54:33] we are
[54:34] also a product of the spoken
[54:38] word praise the Lord God spoke the word
[54:42] and he spoke the lamb and he spoke it to
[54:45] be
[54:46] slain for which purpose for the purpose
[54:49] of you and me praise the Lord and when
[54:52] he spoke it it had come to pass and
[54:56] 4,000 years
[54:59] later the blood of
[55:01] Christ had to
[55:03] bleed praise the Lord that sacrifice had
[55:07] to be
[55:09] offered why because God had spoken
[55:12] it and it had to come to
[55:15] pass praise the Lord and the Bible says
[55:18] that lamb was
[55:20] offered as a
[55:23] sacrifice for us praise the Lord
[55:26] so in his thoughts that lamb was offered
[55:31] as a sacrifice for
[55:33] us so now there is no reason there is no
[55:37] excuse praise the Lord because God had
[55:40] spoken and then God fulfilled it he
[55:44] expressed it and he has given us the
[55:47] blood as an atonement for
[55:50] our praise the Lord that's what the
[55:52] prophet says apply the token and kick
[55:56] all the drush
[55:58] out praise the Lord accept the
[56:01] sacrifice accept the voice there is a
[56:04] voice that is coming out of the blood
[56:07] every day there is a voice that is
[56:10] coming out of the blood which is
[56:13] speaking which is crying praise the Lord
[56:17] listen The Voice listen what the voice
[56:19] says to your heart apply the token by
[56:23] accepting the message of The Voice
[56:26] praise the Lord and
[56:28] acknowledging that it is the Life of
[56:32] Christ himself speaking to your heart
[56:35] the blood of Jesus speaks better
[56:40] things praise the Living God that's what
[56:44] he says and in Hebrews chapter 7 the
[56:49] first part it says listen listen here
[56:53] the Bible said in Revelation
[56:56] I'm going to take you from first to the
[56:59] last
[57:01] one the Bible said in Revelation that
[57:06] when the Beast
[57:07] came he deceived all upon the
[57:10] Earth the Beast
[57:13] did he deceived all upon the Earth those
[57:18] whose names were not written in the
[57:20] Lamb's Book of
[57:22] Life since the Revival began
[57:26] the Revival
[57:29] began does that sound right well since
[57:33] the preacher preached that
[57:37] Madeon since that man was
[57:39] healed no sir since the foundation of
[57:43] the
[57:44] world there was Jesus
[57:48] laying at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain
[57:53] before the foundation of the world
[57:57] Behold the Lamb of God that was SL
[57:59] before the foundation of the
[58:01] world God in the beginning when he saw
[58:05] the sin he saw what would happen he
[58:09] spoke the word praise the Lord and Jesus
[58:13] was laain before the foundation of the
[58:16] world and every person was
[58:20] saved according to the Bible when the
[58:23] lamb was slain
[58:26] in the mind of
[58:27] God praise the Lord each one of us we
[58:32] are
[58:33] saved praise the Lord not when Christ
[58:36] was slain
[58:38] here when he was slain in the mind of
[58:43] God praise the Lord so now when when you
[58:46] accept the
[58:48] sacrifice when we accept the
[58:51] token praise the Lord that's now when we
[58:54] come to the Fulfillment that's now when
[58:56] we come the
[58:57] expression that's now we come the
[59:00] manifestation of the thoughts of God
[59:03] about our
[59:04] Salvation praise the Lord not when we
[59:07] believed no we were saved in the mind of
[59:11] God before Christ was praise the Lord
[59:15] and then he says before the foundation
[59:17] of the world you were
[59:20] included
[59:21] salvation then so what are to do about
[59:27] it believe the sacrifice believe Jesus
[59:30] Christ believe the word of God accept
[59:33] the voice praise the Lord that is coming
[59:37] out praise the Lord accept the voice
[59:41] that is crying out come up
[59:45] here come out praise the Lord and now
[59:50] the Bible says in the Book of
[59:53] Revelation chapter 4 so
[59:56] now God gave us this Blood to prepare us
[1:00:02] throughout the seven Church
[1:00:05] ages God gave us the
[1:00:07] sacrifice he gave us the lamb Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ who
[1:00:13] stood in the midst of the seven golden
[1:00:18] candlesticks he was the
[1:00:21] root praise the Lord he was the like he
[1:00:24] was the cstone
[1:00:26] he was he was the
[1:00:28] fountain out of which each of these
[1:00:33] Messengers Sal of God to the people of
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:37] age praise the Lord so God placed him in
[1:00:40] the midst of
[1:00:42] EG and now he's been ministering through
[1:00:45] the seven Church
[1:00:47] ages praise the Lord presenting the
[1:00:50] blood presenting the voice in the blood
[1:00:54] the blood speaking to each of
[1:00:57] praise the Lord to the age of
[1:01:00] Ephesus spoke all through
[1:01:03] toia praise the Lord And now when he has
[1:01:06] prepared the
[1:01:08] bride and the bride is fully
[1:01:11] whole and she's fully clean and her
[1:01:15] robes are
[1:01:17] white then he takes the bride
[1:01:20] away praise the Lord why because the
[1:01:23] blood accepted the blood
[1:01:27] he accepted to do the
[1:01:30] bathing to do the
[1:01:32] cleansing he accepted the words and he
[1:01:35] lived by the words he walked by the
[1:01:38] words he spoke by the words he fed by
[1:01:42] the word and so he became a part of the
[1:01:45] word and he became the
[1:01:48] word praise the Lord and then we came we
[1:01:51] come to that fullness when we come to
[1:01:53] that St
[1:01:56] man he takes us away because there is no
[1:02:00] more work to be
[1:02:01] done the work is finished and in

[1:13:43] when the judge held the
[1:13:45] book praise the Lord and he was on the

[1:13:52] Proclaim who is Worthy to take the book
[1:13:57] from the judge praise the Lord and the
[1:13:59] Bible says there was no one that was
[1:14:02] worthy no one in heaven no one in Earth
[1:14:06] and John
[1:14:08] cried because no one was
[1:14:10] worthy redeem the book and because no
[1:14:14] one was worthy he thought even
[1:14:17] himself his life was in
[1:14:21] danger praise the Lord but then as he
[1:14:24] was weeping
[1:14:25] the Bible says and now there was a
[1:14:30] lamb praise the Lord that appeared from
[1:14:34] AAR it was
[1:14:36] slain it was bleeding with
[1:14:38] blood the blood of Jesus Christ the

[1:14:58] the
[1:14:59] Saints and he went praise the Lord he
[1:15:03] was done
[1:15:04] overcoming why because you had
[1:15:08] overcome praise the Lord he has not

[1:15:32] Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:15:37] to take the book out of the the hands of
[1:15:40] the judge but then when John turned when
[1:15:44] he turned to see he saw the lamb leading
[1:15:48] with blood they had been
[1:15:51] beaten been
[1:15:53] smed praise the Lord
