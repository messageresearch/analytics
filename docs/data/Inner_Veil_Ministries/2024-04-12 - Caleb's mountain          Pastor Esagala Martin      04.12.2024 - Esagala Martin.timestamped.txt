[23:34] fathers to meet each one of them at
[23:37] their point of needs
[23:41] in the name of our savior.
[23:44] Amen. Amen.
[23:48] Praise the name of the Lord. Before you
[23:51] take your seat, I want to call your
[23:52] attention to the book of Joshua.
[24:01] the book of Joshua. Joshua chapter 14
[24:07] and then verse
[24:13] 12. The scripture says,
[24:17] "Now
[24:19] therefore give this mountain whereof the
[24:23] Lord spake in that day. For thou hadest
[24:26] in that day how the
[24:31] anth were great and fed. If so be the
[24:35] Lord will be with me, then I shall be
[24:39] able to drive them out as the Lord said.
[24:43] And Joshua blessed him and gave unto
[24:46] Caleb the son of Jeffna Hebron for an
[24:50] inheritance.
[24:52] Joshua
[25:41] body. Okay.
[26:15] was Joshua.
[26:38] Praise the name of the Lord.
[26:42] So this
[26:44] evening by the grace of
[26:47] God I want to share something that I've
[26:49] preached
[26:52] before about
[26:57] mountain. Let's pray.
[27:00] Lord Jesus,
[27:02] we want to thank you for this
[27:05] word. For the scripture
[27:08] says that the letter
[27:10] killth but the spirit gives
[27:13] life. So we call on your heavenly
[27:16] father that you may come and
[27:18] minister that you may give life to these
[27:22] letters and speak to each and every
[27:24] person that brought here father. We love
[27:28] you and we thank
[27:29] you in the name of the lord Jesus Christ
[27:32] we
[27:33] pray. Amen. Amen.
[27:36] Amen.
[27:38] So you may take your seats.
[27:41] Sorry for for for making this stand for
[27:43] that
[27:46] way. Uh we are taking on's
[27:50] mountain and as we go you know through
[27:53] this
[27:54] service I want to interest you.
[28:06] that you you think about the mountains
[28:08] before
[28:11] you and among those
[28:15] mountains there is one that belongs to
[28:18] you. You see whenever we talk about a
[28:22] mountain people think about
[28:27] trials, think about
[28:30] problems. But here the mountain that the
[28:34] scripture is talking about
[28:36] this is a
[28:38] blessing is an inheritance.
[28:43] So when they went to you know to to to
[28:46] search the
[28:48] land there are places where they walked
[28:52] through. And as they were
[28:54] walking they came back. And when they
[28:57] came back, they told
[29:00] Moses and each of them gave his report.
[29:05] So when Caleb
[29:09] went with Joshua and they crossed Jordan
[29:14] and he reached
[29:15] there. He went to
[29:17] Joshua and told him that you see God
[29:22] spoke through
[29:24] Moses and promised me a certain a
[29:27] specific you know
[29:31] place. It wasn't all of
[29:35] canon. There was a specific
[29:38] place that God had promised you
[29:42] know and when reached there where we
[29:46] have read he came to Joshua and told and
[29:50] told him that you
[29:52] know God through
[29:55] Moses gave me this mountain and I'm
[29:58] coming to you because God has given you
[30:01] the responsibility.
[30:03] to allot to all the
[30:07] tribes their
[30:09] inheritance. So I'm coming to demand
[30:11] what God gave
[30:14] me. Praise the name of the Lord. So even
[30:17] as we ought to stand in that you know in
[30:20] that place
[30:22] always that when we search the promises
[30:25] of
[30:26] God we are not you know demanding what
[30:29] is not ours.
[30:31] they are all ours. So you may have, you
[30:34] know, a mountain that you're focusing on
[30:36] this
[30:38] evening, but you know, as we go through
[30:42] here, let's keep meditating upon some of
[30:44] those
[30:47] things. Let's pick it up in the book of
[30:49] Numbers, chapter
[30:52] 13, and then verse one. Numbers 13 and
[30:56] verse one.
[30:58] The scripture
[30:59] says, "And the Lord spake unto
[31:03] Moses,
[31:05] saying, Send thou men that they may
[31:08] search the land of Canaan, which I give
[31:11] unto the children of Israel, of every
[31:14] tribe of their fathers shall ye send
[31:17] among everyone a ruler among them."
[31:21] And Moses by the commandment of the Lord
[31:24] sent them from the wilderness of Pon.
[31:27] All those men were heads of the children
[31:30] of
[31:32] Israel. Praise the name of the Lord.
[31:37] Amen. Welcome, brother. God bless
[31:43] you. Pick it up from Numbers 13 and then
[31:46] verse verse one to verse three.
[31:57] from verse 13. From verse one to verse
[31:59] three,
[32:08] Numbers
[32:10] 13 from verse one to verse three.
[32:30] Monagua shore.
[32:51] Praise the name of the Lord. So we find
[32:54] that God sending these people to search
[32:57] the
[32:57] land, they had to be at a
[33:00] wilderness. And even when Moses was
[33:02] choosing the people, God told Moses,
[33:06] they have to be rulers. And so it is
[33:10] always the rulers that search the land.
[33:13] And if we are to search the storehouses
[33:15] of
[33:17] God, search by the ruler. So praise the
[33:20] name of the Lord. Not that it had to be
[33:22] the rulers to go up and search the
[33:26] promise. And it's always a
[33:28] ruler that can search the promises.
[33:32] Personally in this body, I cannot search
[33:34] the promises of God.
[33:37] a ruler that rules my body and that is
[33:40] the Holy Ghost that searches the
[33:43] promises of God. Praise the name of the
[33:45] Lord. Let's turn to the book of 1
[33:49] Corinthians chapter 2 and then verse
[33:53] 11. Verse 10, the scripture says, "But
[33:57] God has revealed them unto us by his
[34:00] spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[34:02] things, yes, the deep things of God. For
[34:05] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[34:08] save the spirit of a man, which is in
[34:11] him? Even so, the things of God knoweth
[34:14] no man, but the spirit of God.
[34:30] Amen.
[34:36] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[34:38] scripture is telling us that if we are
[34:41] to understand the things of
[34:43] God, we must get in his spirit because
[34:46] it's only his spirit that can reveal to
[34:50] us the things of God. Because the spirit
[34:53] of a man knows the things of a man.
[34:56] Praise the name of the Lord. When a
[34:58] child is
[34:59] born, the spirit of a man that is given
[35:03] to this child teaches this child to walk
[35:07] this child to speak. Yet we have to have
[35:09] the spirit of God for us to know the
[35:12] things of God to grow in the things of
[35:14] God. So if we are to search the
[35:17] storehouse of God, search it by the
[35:20] spirit of God. That spirit of God must
[35:24] have rulership over this our bodies
[35:27] because we see here that God told Moses
[35:31] not every person can go and search the
[35:34] land take a ruler the person that is
[35:37] ruling a tribe that's the only person
[35:40] that can go and search the promises.
[35:42] When we are searching the premises of
[35:44] God, search the premises of
[35:47] God by the spirit. We just wake up and
[35:51] then we begin thinking about something.
[35:53] So we need to get in the spirit. Walk in
[35:56] the spirit and live by the spirit of
[35:58] God. That's why the scripture says
[36:01] therefore now no
[36:03] condemnation that walk after the spirit
[36:05] of God. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[36:08] the spirit of God is what we use to
[36:11] search the things of God. Praise the
[36:13] name of the Lord. Just like as in
[36:16] Israel, Samuel was a
[36:19] ruler. If there was a battle to win,
[36:23] it's Samuel that searched it
[36:26] out and inquired by of
[36:29] God. Praise the name of the Lord. And if
[36:32] there was a king to be
[36:34] installed, Samuel who knew who was the
[36:38] king was standing in the position of a
[36:42] ruler fighting the Holy Spirit. Praise
[36:45] the name of the Lord. Listen what the
[36:47] prophet says here in the message the
[36:49] rejected king. He says now Samuel in our
[36:54] message represents the Holy
[36:57] Spirit. Now, Samuel was the mouthpiece
[37:00] of God. And today, the Holy Spirit is
[37:04] the mouthpiece of God. And today,
[37:08] instead of having all of our different
[37:10] fandangles of
[37:12] foolishness in church, God wants us to
[37:16] let him
[37:17] rule, not pops, bishops, general
[37:22] overseers, all doctrines, and
[37:25] nominations and everything. He sent the
[37:28] Holy
[37:29] Spirit to rule the church and that is
[37:33] the same person that will rule you. So
[37:36] if if you are to search the things of
[37:39] God, it must be
[37:41] through the Holy Ghost. Praise the name
[37:44] of the Lord. So the same Holy Ghost must
[37:48] rule in our daily life. Praise the name
[37:51] of the Lord. That's why Paul says all
[37:55] the things that I learned
[37:57] from
[37:59] Gamaria from
[38:01] Gamaria and all the teachers of the law.
[38:04] I count them as a
[38:07] D. I satisfy to you and the things I
[38:11] preached, they all revealed by Christ.
[38:15] Praise the name of the Lord. Because we
[38:17] as
[38:18] Christians, we must daily be led by the
[38:21] Holy Spirit. Whatever you have to
[38:24] do, be in the spirit. And that's what
[38:27] the prophet tells
[38:28] us at the age
[38:31] of for him to see the things of
[38:35] God for John to be you know in the to
[38:38] see the things of God at the age
[38:42] of the
[38:44] spirit with the name of God. So even us
[38:47] to see the things of
[38:49] God search the promises of God.
[38:53] that he has given to us. We must make
[38:55] sure that we walk in the
[38:58] spirit. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[39:01] the prophet says in the message
[39:03] fellowship through the reconciliation of
[39:05] the
[39:07] blood. He was talking about
[39:09] Job because in the body Job Job would
[39:14] have cast
[39:15] God because of the things he was going
[39:18] through. But the prophet tells us that
[39:21] Job being a
[39:23] prophet, he got in the
[39:25] spirit. Praise the name of the Lord. In
[39:28] the situations that he was going
[39:30] through, he didn't think about them
[39:34] through his mind. He got in the spirit
[39:37] and searched the riches of God. And when
[39:40] he searched the things of God, he went
[39:43] into, you know, the storehouse of
[39:45] God, he saw himself standing.
[39:49] and he saw his redeemer in the name of
[39:51] the Lord. So the prophet says that's the
[39:54] only way you you are going to get
[39:56] anything anyhow is when you get in the
[40:03] spirit. The power of God come on
[40:07] him for the coming of the
[40:10] Lord. He rised on his
[40:13] feet. He shook
[40:15] himself. The thunders
[40:19] roared. The lightnings
[40:22] flashed. Job said, "I know my redeemer
[40:25] liveth. And at the last days, he will
[40:29] stand on the earth. For the skin worms
[40:33] destroy this
[40:35] body. Yet in my flesh shall I see
[40:38] God, whom I shall see for myself.
[40:42] mine eyes shall
[40:44] behold. And not another. So Job when he
[40:47] got into the spirit, praise the name of
[40:50] the Lord, he saw his
[40:52] redeemer and that was his
[40:55] encouragement. Worms were eating his
[40:59] body, sure that the mountain that he had
[41:02] that
[41:03] day in his
[41:05] selection, he he was to get it. And that
[41:09] was the
[41:12] that he had in that day. So body typing
[41:15] the
[41:15] rulership of the Holy Spirit and how the
[41:19] people in this shadow of
[41:21] flesh and
[41:23] search. He let only rulers to go and
[41:26] search the
[41:29] land of their
[41:31] words sober able to judge and lead
[41:36] others. Praise the name of the Lord.
[41:39] What I want you to know is that for us
[41:41] to search the riches of
[41:44] glory, we must get in the spirit of
[41:47] God. Praise the name of the Lord. So in
[41:50] the book of uh
[41:52] numbers where we have
[41:54] read numbers chapter
[42:01] 13 and then verse
[42:05] three the scripture
[42:10] says and Moses by the commandment of the
[42:15] Lord sent them from the wilderness of
[42:17] Pon
[42:19] All those men were heads of the of the
[42:21] children of
[42:30] Israel. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[42:33] what I want us to pick
[42:35] here is that they had to be in a
[42:38] wilderness for them to search the land.
[42:42] And sometimes
[42:43] God brings us at a wilderness.
[42:48] Praise the name of the Lord that we may
[42:51] search. We may pray, we may worship him,
[42:56] we may
[42:57] desire you know when we at that
[43:01] point where there is no water, there is
[43:04] no food, they you know they after
[43:08] us, there is nowhere where we can
[43:11] plant. That's where God brought the
[43:14] children of Israel. He told them that
[43:17] this is the place where you must go and
[43:21] search the land.
[43:22] And all others here if they are having
[43:26] everything they will not pray they will
[43:29] not get in the spirit. But he wants you
[43:32] to get at a point where you stand at a
[43:36] par where there is no
[43:38] abundance. Praise the name of the Lord
[43:41] that you may look
[43:42] up God and pray to God. Oh, I am
[43:48] searching the land. looking out for the
[43:52] promises that you gave unto your
[43:54] children. I'm praying, oh God, I'm sick,
[43:58] you promised that by your stripes, we
[44:01] are healed and therefore I'm praying
[44:03] this evening healing me causes you to
[44:08] stand at a wilderness. Praise the name
[44:11] of the Lord. They had to be at par for
[44:14] them to search the land. So when we at
[44:17] friends we should not
[44:19] mama all together friends when we at
[44:23] parents we shouldn't
[44:25] comply all that we have to do is to
[44:29] stand you know strong like a job and get
[44:34] in the spirit and then we search the
[44:36] land search the promises of then we
[44:40] capture one's mountain and we say god
[44:43] this is what we want today this is we
[44:46] want this year. This is what we want you
[44:48] to do for us. That's how stood that's
[44:52] how Joshua stood. Praise the name of the
[44:54] Lord. So God allows us sometimes to
[44:57] stand in the wilderness of so that we
[45:00] don't feel
[45:01] comfortable at all the wilderness
[45:05] of the ruler, the Holy Ghost. We have to
[45:09] search the promises.
[45:11] That's why the scripture continues and
[45:13] say numbers 13 verse 17 says and Moses
[45:19] sent them to spy out the
[45:23] land and said unto them get ye up this
[45:28] way southward and go into the mountain
[45:32] and see the Lord what it is and see the
[45:35] land what it is that dwell
[45:38] therein whether they be strong or weak,
[45:43] few or many. And what the land is that
[45:47] they dwell in, whether it is it is be
[45:50] good or
[45:51] bad, what city they be they they be that
[45:56] dwell that dwell
[45:58] there, whether in tents or in
[46:02] stronghold. And what the land is,
[46:06] whether it be fat or
[46:08] lean, whether there be wood
[46:13] therein, and be of good
[46:16] courage, and bring of the fruit of the
[46:18] land. Now the time was the time of the
[46:21] first ripe
[46:26] grapes. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[46:29] you see that when Moses is sending
[46:31] them, he's so
[46:34] specific. He tells them, "You must
[46:39] know what is this
[46:42] land. Who are the people that dwell in
[46:44] this
[46:46] land? Are these people strong or
[46:49] weak? Are they few or many?" Praise the
[46:52] name of the Lord.
[46:55] So
[46:56] Moses was being
[46:58] specific because he knew that these are
[47:02] the things that are going to encourage
[47:05] us to walk with God
[47:07] daily. Praise the name of the Lord. When
[47:10] you know the
[47:12] multitude of the soldiers in the land
[47:15] where you're going
[47:17] today, you will know how to
[47:19] prepare. Praise the name of the Lord.
[47:22] Moses told them that when you see the
[47:26] land, you have to come with the
[47:28] fruit without an evidence that the land
[47:32] is indeed there. And there there are
[47:34] fruits there. And what God told us is
[47:38] indeed there. Praise the name of the
[47:41] Lord. And Moses told them, be of good
[47:45] courage. on this land here. Moses was
[47:49] certain that they were that there were
[47:53] soldiers, there were fighters. It was
[47:56] not going to be easy to take it. But he
[48:00] knew that God cannot give us a promise
[48:04] that he can't grant unto us because
[48:07] whatsoever God
[48:08] promises it is not us that go and take
[48:12] by our own. It is God in his season.
[48:16] comes and gives praise the name of the
[48:19] Lord. So the scripture says he ascended
[48:22] by the
[48:24] south and came at
[48:29] he verse
[48:31] 22 and they ascended by the south and
[48:39] came and the children
[48:43] of now was built seven years before Zion
[48:50] And they returned from searching of the
[48:52] land after 40
[48:54] days. And they told him and said, we
[48:57] came into the land whether thou sentest
[48:59] us, and surely it floweth with milk and
[49:02] honey, and this is the fruit of it.
[49:05] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[49:08] dwell in the land, and the cities are
[49:10] world and very great. And moreover, we
[49:13] saw the children of Anak there. The
[49:15] Amalachite dwell in the land of the
[49:17] south. And the Hittites and the Jupites
[49:20] and the Amorites dwell in the mountains.
[49:23] And the Canonites dwell by the sea and
[49:26] by the coast of Jordan.
[49:54] BNC.
[50:21] Praise the name of the Lord. So verse
[50:24] 30, the scripture says, "Calb stealed
[50:27] the people before Moses and said, "Let
[50:29] us go up at once and possess it, for we
[50:32] are well able to overcome it.
[50:55] Praise the name of the
[50:56] Lord. Told
[50:58] them we are more than able to overcome
[51:02] it. But verse
[51:04] 31, the scripture brings another report.
[51:08] He says, "But the men that went up with
[51:10] him said, we be not able to go up
[51:13] against the people, for they are
[51:15] stronger than us than we.
[51:27] A man and they brought up an evil report
[51:30] of the land which they had searched unto
[51:33] the children of Israel, saying, The land
[51:35] through which we have gone to search it
[51:38] is a land that eatth up the inhabitants
[51:40] thereof, and all the people that we see
[51:43] in it are men of a great stature.
[52:13] Praise the name of the Lord. So we see
[52:15] that part of the part of the
[52:18] spies of them
[52:21] of them of the
[52:23] spies. The scripture says they brought
[52:26] an evil
[52:28] report. They went to search the land and
[52:31] they came back and they said these
[52:33] people are very
[52:34] strong. We are not able to take the
[52:37] land. We shouldn't stand
[52:39] there because these
[52:42] people they looked at who they
[52:45] are. They looked at their
[52:48] stature. They said this body here, can I
[52:51] fight a
[52:53] giant? Praise the name of the Lord. They
[52:56] looked at, you know, their skills they
[52:58] had, the professions they had and the
[53:02] strength they had. That's all that they
[53:05] looked at. They walked
[53:08] cannally walked by flesh. And they knew
[53:11] that you know what I can't do
[53:15] myself then I cannot have it.
[53:18] So these people they were not looking at
[53:21] the promises of
[53:23] God. They searched the
[53:26] land and that's why they all died
[53:30] there because they couldn't you know you
[53:33] know move into the
[53:35] channel that God used to give the
[53:38] promise. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[53:41] these people they brought an evil
[53:44] report and they caused all other people
[53:47] to perish in the
[53:49] wilderness because of their you know
[53:52] understanding and their rejection of the
[53:55] word of
[53:56] God. So the scripture continues and
[53:58] says, "And there we saw giants,
[54:07] the sons of Anarch,
[54:09] which came of the giants,
[54:14] and we were in our own sight as
[54:21] grasshoppers, and so we were in their
[54:23] sights.
[54:26] Praise the name of the Lord. You search
[54:29] the
[54:29] land and you see a promise of
[54:32] God. And you know many times the prophet
[54:35] tells us that the reason people don't
[54:38] get
[54:39] healed is because they look at the
[54:42] circumstances. They look at the
[54:44] symptoms.
[54:46] They failed to get
[54:48] into the channel that Jonah was in when
[54:51] he was down there. And he prayed
[54:55] believing that if he can only face where
[54:58] the temple
[54:59] is, God will hear his prayer, take him
[55:03] out of the out of the out of the sea.
[55:06] Praise the name of the Lord. So even
[55:08] these people, they looked at you know
[55:11] their theological understanding of the
[55:13] word.
[55:16] They say this disease is too hard to be
[55:20] healed. And they say this blessing is
[55:22] too hard to
[55:24] get. They say this behavior is too hard
[55:26] to
[55:28] overcome. Praise the name of the Lord.
[55:31] These men looked at their abilities.
[55:34] They walked by the flesh. They never
[55:36] believed in the God
[55:37] of Even after all the
[55:40] miracles performed among them. They took
[55:43] the promises of God
[55:45] lightly and therefore they became a
[55:48] stumbling
[55:49] block because of their
[55:52] unbelief. Such men live among
[55:56] us. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[55:59] will go and tell them. I believe God. I
[56:03] believe all the
[56:04] promises. And then he will tell you, I
[56:08] was sick. I didn't get healed. Why do
[56:11] you believe God for
[56:13] Praise the name of the Lord. These are
[56:15] the people. These are the spies. Praise
[56:19] the name of the Lord. Paul says in the
[56:22] book of Philippians chapter
[56:23] 3 and then verse 18 for many
[56:27] walk of whom I have told you often and
[56:31] now tell you even weeping that they are
[56:34] the enemies of the cross of Christ whose
[56:37] end is destruction whose body is their
[56:40] belly and whose glory is in their shame
[56:42] who mind earthly things for our
[56:45] conversation is in heaven from where
[56:48] also we look for the Savior, the Lord
[56:51] Jesus Christ. Philippians 3:18
[57:36] Praise the name of the Lord. Paul is
[57:39] talking about the kind of
[57:42] people that search the land that receive
[57:45] the promises of God and they disbelieve
[57:49] them. And some of them they receive the
[57:52] promises of God and they think that it
[57:56] is their
[57:57] abilities that is going to give them
[58:00] this. Praise the name of the Lord. But
[58:03] the promises of God are fulfilled by God
[58:06] himself.
[58:07] when he promises you that I'm going to
[58:10] heal you. You know there are many
[58:12] promises of God but I love to give I
[58:16] love giving an example of
[58:18] healing because it is a common thing
[58:20] that we all go
[58:21] through. So when God tells you I'm going
[58:24] to heal you. It is not you that heal
[58:29] yourself. God
[58:31] himself that comes down and grants you
[58:34] the healing. that these men
[58:37] here
[58:39] thought that the promise of God is
[58:42] fulfilled. Maybe when I do this, when I
[58:46] do this, when I do the other, praise the
[58:49] name of the Lord. But God proves every
[58:53] day that he's the one that brings to us
[58:57] the fulfillment of his
[58:59] word. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[59:02] that is the difference.
[59:04] Joshua and Caleb had told these people
[59:08] because when Joshua's time came Joshua
[59:11] told these people that if if it
[59:15] go to us the land let's turn to the book
[59:19] of you know numbers 14 and then verse
[59:23] 6
[59:25] says and
[59:27] Joshua let's begin from verse five it
[59:29] says then Moses and fell on their faces
[59:33] before the assembly of the congregation
[59:35] of the children of
[59:44] Israel. And Joshua the son of Nan and
[59:48] Caleb the son of Jeffa which were of
[59:50] them that searched the land read their
[59:53] clothes.
[1:00:03] And they spake unto all the company of
[1:00:06] the children of Israel, saying, "The
[1:00:08] land which we pass through to search it
[1:00:10] is an exceeding good
[1:00:20] land." Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:00:23] here Joshua
[1:00:24] and had the same testimony with the
[1:00:28] other 10 spies and they said that indeed
[1:00:30] the land we
[1:00:32] search is good is exceedingly good. The
[1:00:37] picture says that Joshua and Khaled they
[1:00:41] rent their
[1:00:43] clothes because they saw that distant
[1:00:47] spies are bringing a reproach in the
[1:00:50] word of God in the name of God showing
[1:00:54] the people. God can fail to give what he
[1:00:57] has
[1:00:58] promised. And the scripture says down in
[1:01:02] verse eight, the Lord lighten us to
[1:01:05] bring us into this
[1:01:07] land. Joshua and we're not depending on
[1:01:12] their own
[1:01:13] abilities. If the Lord delight in
[1:01:16] us, if the Lord is pleased in us, he
[1:01:20] will give us the land. It is not us who
[1:01:22] are going to fight for the land. It is
[1:01:25] not us who are going to bring the right
[1:01:26] to God. All that we have to do to obey
[1:01:30] the word of the Lord. Obey the promises
[1:01:33] of God. Believe the promises of God.
[1:01:36] Praise the name of the Lord. Except that
[1:01:40] we cannot have anything because these
[1:01:42] men refuse to believe the word of
[1:01:45] God and they walked by what they
[1:01:48] wanted. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:01:50] Joshua continues and says and he says in
[1:01:53] verse
[1:01:54] 9 rebel not he against the
[1:01:59] Lord. Don't
[1:02:01] rebel. Don't you disbelieve the word of
[1:02:05] God to believe every word of
[1:02:08] God because that's what God requires us
[1:02:12] to do is to believe all his
[1:02:15] word to believe all his
[1:02:17] word is to believe whatever he has
[1:02:20] revealed in our
[1:02:21] day by
[1:02:23] it not leave out
[1:02:26] anything. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:02:28] God requires
[1:02:30] us. Listen what the prophet says in the
[1:02:34] message of the eagle in her
[1:02:39] nest. He says she goes just as high as
[1:02:42] she can
[1:02:45] go. Those little
[1:02:48] igllets not ming a
[1:02:50] bit.
[1:02:53] Not they got their little big set in
[1:02:56] them feathers.
[1:03:00] They just can't
[1:03:02] mama. And that's the way God takes his
[1:03:05] church. If you are really set in the
[1:03:09] word, you don't
[1:03:11] mama. You just hold on. Praise the name
[1:03:15] of the Lord. That's where Joshua
[1:03:17] and stood. Indeed, they saw the the
[1:03:23] anarch the
[1:03:26] anarchies. They saw the
[1:03:29] giants. They saw the
[1:03:31] sonas. They saw the friends and the
[1:03:35] walls. But they never murmured.
[1:03:39] They believed that God promised he's
[1:03:43] going to give
[1:03:44] Israel the land. He continues and says,
[1:03:47] "If God made the
[1:03:50] promise, God can keep his promise."
[1:03:53] because they just hold
[1:03:55] on. And she takes them in two
[1:03:59] places. They never thought they would
[1:04:01] ever be when she's soing
[1:04:04] up on she goes into the bright blue
[1:04:09] sky. And now the strange
[1:04:13] thing when she gets up there, she checks
[1:04:18] them everyone off right up there.
[1:04:25] Praise the name of the Lord. He says
[1:04:27] when she gets up
[1:04:29] there in the blue
[1:04:31] sky, the mother
[1:04:33] eagle shakes them
[1:04:36] off. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:04:39] they begin, you know, crying
[1:04:44] out. And and he says, "That's the way
[1:04:47] God does his
[1:04:49] church. Shakes them off.
[1:04:53] fly for yourself. And the strange thing,
[1:04:57] as she checks them
[1:04:59] off, she doesn't leave them. She makes a
[1:05:03] big circle and goes out and flies
[1:05:08] around watching them. And there those
[1:05:11] little fellows knowing what to do. For
[1:05:14] the first time, they are flapping their
[1:05:16] little
[1:05:17] wings or they turning over some some
[1:05:20] salts.
[1:05:22] and everything else. But they are
[1:05:24] flapping anyhow. They're making some
[1:05:27] kind of an effort. And if there there
[1:05:30] ever was a time that the church needs to
[1:05:32] do some
[1:05:36] flapping. Now the little eagles are not
[1:05:41] worried. They all together
[1:05:43] aware. She just flies
[1:05:46] around in the name of the Lord. If those
[1:05:49] little eagles there
[1:05:51] They they they they try their first you
[1:05:54] know sort of of of
[1:05:56] flying but they are not worried about
[1:05:59] anything because they know their mother
[1:06:02] is running
[1:06:03] around flying around them in the name of
[1:06:07] the Lord. So they know what they are
[1:06:09] trying out but their mother is right
[1:06:12] around. How much how much more should we
[1:06:16] be that our
[1:06:18] God of all heavens and earth
[1:06:21] who gives us the unfailing word. He has
[1:06:24] given us the promise. He has given each
[1:06:26] one of
[1:06:27] us. How much should we be sure that the
[1:06:32] promise will be fulfilled? Praise the
[1:06:35] name of the Lord. So he continues and
[1:06:37] says that's our great mother, the Holy
[1:06:41] Spirit. So don't be afraid of the of
[1:06:45] fantism of wildfire. Our mother is
[1:06:49] watching over
[1:06:51] us. She makes those
[1:06:53] circles and and is she fast, you should
[1:06:58] see her. And the thing of it is she can
[1:07:02] pick as many
[1:07:05] up and if a little fell is
[1:07:08] exhausted, just stand over and over and
[1:07:13] over and can't catch his breath. She can
[1:07:16] catch one with her foot and another with
[1:07:19] her foot or catch it in her mouth. All
[1:07:23] the little
[1:07:25] eagles are so
[1:07:27] carefree because they are not resting in
[1:07:29] their own
[1:07:31] ability but they are resting in the ever
[1:07:34] presence and the ability of their mother
[1:07:37] who is watching over them. Oh my. As
[1:07:41] long as he's watching, as long as it's
[1:07:44] his word, as long as he has packed you
[1:07:47] out here. And what are you scared about?
[1:07:51] They are just having an oldfashioned
[1:07:53] Pentecostal jubile up
[1:07:55] there
[1:07:57] just trying to act like the mother and
[1:08:00] she's watching over them because they
[1:08:03] are Oh, how beautiful it is. Brother,
[1:08:08] it's not what I can do but what God has
[1:08:11] promised
[1:08:12] me. Amen. He will do it and a total
[1:08:15] surrender is what I need. The 10 spies
[1:08:20] never had that
[1:08:21] revelation. They looked at their
[1:08:23] abilities. They realized they couldn't
[1:08:26] manage which was very right. But they
[1:08:30] did
[1:08:31] surrender to God himself. So this
[1:08:35] evening the mountain before us praise
[1:08:38] the name of the lord we shouldn't fear
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:41] circumstances we shouldn't look at the
[1:08:44] at the symptoms around
[1:08:45] us stand and say god you promise and you
[1:08:50] able to fulfill it is not me ability but
[1:08:55] you're more than able to perform that
[1:08:58] you promised that's where stood praise
[1:09:01] the name of the lord and as long
[1:09:04] and Joshua standing on back and certain
[1:09:08] that they are going to cross Jordan.
[1:09:11] these people by seeing the promised
[1:09:14] land and the thorns around it. I said we
[1:09:18] can't cross and indeed they died in the
[1:09:21] way. Praise the name of the Lord in
[1:09:23] perfect strength by perfect weakness. He
[1:09:27] says when we are insufficient
[1:09:31] ourselves then we are subject to yield
[1:09:34] to God's
[1:09:36] spirit as long as we think that we can
[1:09:39] do it.
[1:09:40] then we can't do it. But when we get to
[1:09:43] a place where we know we can't do it,
[1:09:47] then we yield ourself to God and he does
[1:09:51] it. So then if it is us trying to do
[1:09:55] it, we will
[1:09:57] fire. But if we will just yield
[1:10:00] ourselves to
[1:10:02] God, then God can't fire. There is only
[1:10:06] one thing that God cannot do.
[1:10:09] And that is fail. He can do anything
[1:10:13] else but fail. He cannot fail. So as
[1:10:17] long as we are trying in
[1:10:19] ourselves and depending on our own
[1:10:22] abilities and so forth, why we will do
[1:10:27] nothing. But when we get to a place
[1:10:31] where we know we are
[1:10:33] nothing, then God can use us.
[1:10:36] Praise the name of the Lord. That's
[1:10:38] where we need to be today that we can
[1:10:41] completely
[1:10:43] surrender to God for him to lead us to
[1:10:47] strengthen us, perform his will in us,
[1:10:50] not ask ourselves, depending on our
[1:10:53] mind, depending on our abilities, but to
[1:10:56] make a complete
[1:10:58] surrender. In paragraph 57, he says,
[1:11:01] "And make a complete surrender. We
[1:11:04] cannot use our
[1:11:05] ability. We go to make a complete
[1:11:09] surrender. To come to God, you've got to
[1:11:13] surrender to him both soul, body, and
[1:11:18] spirit. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:11:21] Everything that you are has to be
[1:11:23] surrendered to God in order that he can
[1:11:26] work his
[1:11:27] way in you and in me. Now that's hard I
[1:11:31] know cuz we are always wanting to put
[1:11:33] our part in
[1:11:35] something that we know you know that we
[1:11:39] want to do it. We say I just know it
[1:11:43] should be done this way. But as long as
[1:11:45] you are doing it that way it's going to
[1:11:48] be wrong and God will never use that.
[1:11:52] Praise the name of the
[1:11:53] Lord. Are we together friends? Let's
[1:11:57] start to numbers 14.
[1:11:59] And then verse
[1:12:01] 24, the scripture says, "But my
[1:12:06] servant, because he had another
[1:12:09] spirit with him, and hath followed me
[1:12:14] fully, him will I bring into the
[1:12:17] land, where he
[1:12:20] went, and his seed shall possess
[1:12:24] it." What did he do? The scripture say,
[1:12:28] He had another spirit. And then there is
[1:12:31] another thing that he speaks
[1:12:33] about. He hath followed me
[1:12:37] fully. Are we following the Lord
[1:12:40] fully? That should be our desire that we
[1:12:43] follow God
[1:12:45] fully. We follow his word
[1:12:48] fully. We obey him
[1:12:50] fully. We don't take out
[1:12:53] anything. We don't add anything. that we
[1:12:57] follow him according to his
[1:13:00] word. Every
[1:13:01] letter, every revelation that has been
[1:13:05] given to us, let's follow the Lord
[1:13:08] without adding anything or removing
[1:13:11] anything. So we find
[1:13:13] that
[1:13:15] testimony was not a
[1:13:19] understanding. It was not after a
[1:13:21] certain group
[1:13:23] resolution. It was a spiritual
[1:13:27] revelation because the scripture is
[1:13:29] telling us he had another spirit. And
[1:13:32] when you have that
[1:13:34] spirit, it'll bring the spiritual
[1:13:36] revelation of
[1:13:37] God and thus will not
[1:13:40] walk by the body by the flesh, but that
[1:13:45] spirit. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:48] Because we are certain the same way that
[1:13:51] Paul says in the book of first
[1:13:53] Corinthians,
[1:13:55] And then chapter one
[1:14:03] rather 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 19.
[1:14:11] Let's speak it in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:14:13] 1 verse 18.
[1:14:19] He says, "But as God is true, our word
[1:14:22] toward you was not yay and nigh. For the
[1:14:26] son of God, Jesus Christ, who was
[1:14:29] preached among you, by us, even by me,
[1:14:32] and Sylvanas and Timoththeus was not yay
[1:14:36] and nay, but in him was yay." Verse 20,
[1:14:41] for all the promises of God, in him I y
[1:14:45] and in him amen and the glory of God by
[1:14:49] us.
[1:15:02] Wow. Yes.
[1:15:19] Wow. Wow.
[1:15:37] 21. Praise the name of the Lord. So in
[1:15:39] verse 20, he says, "For all the promises
[1:15:42] of
[1:15:45] God in
[1:15:48] him they are." Amen. Praise the name of
[1:15:51] the Lord. So we have to get in
[1:15:54] him for all his
[1:15:56] promises to be
[1:15:59] yay. I hope we are working together.
[1:16:02] Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[1:16:05] prophet Isaiah
[1:16:07] in the
[1:16:08] message Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:16:11] and
[1:16:12] forever. I want to make a follow up on
[1:16:14] this
[1:16:15] scripture. He says, "Now I believe that
[1:16:18] healing is in the
[1:16:21] atonement." That it was included when
[1:16:23] Isaiah said he was wounded for our
[1:16:30] transgression. With his stripes, we are
[1:16:33] healed. When Jesus died at
[1:16:35] Calvary, he saved every
[1:16:38] sinner that ever was. Praise the name of
[1:16:42] the Lord. So if your mountain tonight is
[1:16:45] to attain
[1:16:46] salvation, it is
[1:16:49] yours in him. Praise the name of the
[1:16:52] Lord. He says he saved every
[1:16:55] sinner that ever was, but it will never
[1:16:58] do you no good until you personally
[1:17:02] accept it as your personal
[1:17:04] savior. And he healed every sick person.
[1:17:08] That would ever be sick, but it will
[1:17:11] never do you no good.
[1:17:12] until you accept it as your own personal
[1:17:16] property. He was wounded for our
[1:17:19] transgressions. With his stripes, we
[1:17:21] were healed. It's all past tense. All of
[1:17:24] God can do for you. He has already done.
[1:17:27] He has already did when he when he Jesus
[1:17:30] died to reconcile
[1:17:33] sinners and back to Christ at
[1:17:36] Calvary. Now, that's the gospel,
[1:17:39] friends. As clear as I know,
[1:17:43] It's the
[1:17:44] individual now. Maybe well what's what's
[1:17:48] the use in
[1:17:49] preaching? That's what a minister is
[1:17:51] for. God sent preachers to preach the
[1:17:54] word. When you hear it, search it. See,
[1:17:58] it's the truth. Accept it. Now, if the
[1:18:01] preacher doesn't save you, this message
[1:18:04] doesn't save you. Your personal faith in
[1:18:06] a risen Lord Jesus is what saves
[1:18:09] you. No matter how much you would cry,
[1:18:13] how loud you would
[1:18:15] holler, how much you would take on, it
[1:18:18] will never save you until you believe it
[1:18:21] with all your heart and stand up and
[1:18:25] confess it. For he is the high priest of
[1:18:28] our confession. Hebrews 3. All what we
[1:18:32] confess is the high priest to make
[1:18:35] intercession upon what we confess is the
[1:18:38] truth. Anything that was included in the
[1:18:41] atonement is the personal property of
[1:18:44] every
[1:18:45] believer. When a man gets saved or a
[1:18:48] woman, boy or girl, God gives them a
[1:18:52] check as it was with Jesus's name at the
[1:18:56] bottom of every check for anything for
[1:19:00] anything redemptive blessing that Jesus
[1:19:03] died for it is your personal
[1:19:06] property. Don't be afraid.
[1:19:09] to fill it out. The bank of heaven will
[1:19:13] recognize that. Praise the name of the
[1:19:15] Lord. So for us to take the mountains
[1:19:19] before us, to take the blessings before
[1:19:22] us, take the promises before us, to
[1:19:26] stand in the word of God today, to stand
[1:19:28] the prophecy today. What we have to do
[1:19:31] is to believe the
[1:19:33] word accept it because it is all
[1:19:36] ours. Not what we have done but what he
[1:19:40] has done. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:19:43] But yet these 10
[1:19:45] spies Joshua went over and brought back
[1:19:48] the evidence to him and what did they
[1:19:51] do? They mured. They disbelieved. We
[1:19:55] shouldn't stand their friends. That's
[1:19:57] the message tonight. If we are to stand
[1:20:02] like and say Joshua give my
[1:20:05] mountain, we must believe every word
[1:20:07] that God has given
[1:20:09] us. every revelation that God has given
[1:20:13] us because it is until it is a
[1:20:16] revelation that it can edify the world.
[1:20:20] So when it is revealed to you, take it,
[1:20:23] believe it, live by it, let it, you
[1:20:27] know, multiply in
[1:20:29] you, they bring the first
[1:20:32] fruit that Moses, you know, told them to
[1:20:35] bring, go and search the land and come
[1:20:38] with a fruit. And when you come back
[1:20:44] believe your faith is the word. Praise
[1:20:48] the name of the Lord. And that's you
[1:20:50] know what always gives us the
[1:20:53] victory
[1:20:56] standing with the word in all
[1:20:59] situations. The prophet has told us
[1:21:02] about the eagle, the mother eagle and
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:06] igllet. She lifts them
[1:21:08] up and they try out. It's not easy. But
[1:21:13] the prophet side they do not mama. All
[1:21:16] they have to do is to try out believing.
[1:21:21] It's not them. Mother is watching. They
[1:21:24] do not fall to the ground. They are
[1:21:27] trying to
[1:21:28] go lift them up again. Praise the name
[1:21:31] of the Lord. He restores us. He revives
[1:21:35] us. Let's
[1:21:37] continue believing his word and standing
[1:21:41] on all the
[1:21:42] promises God has given us this day.
[1:21:45] That's why the prophet says in the
[1:21:49] message if God has made a
[1:21:51] promise, God will keep that
[1:21:54] promise. Being fully
[1:21:57] persuaded that what he promised he was
[1:22:00] able to
[1:22:01] perform, God keeps his
[1:22:05] promise. And
[1:22:07] Abraham was fully
[1:22:09] persuaded. No matter how
[1:22:12] ridiculous, it looked to the mind or
[1:22:15] anyone else. It looked all right to
[1:22:19] Abraham because
[1:22:21] Abraham never looked at so much at what
[1:22:24] the promise
[1:22:27] was. Oh, how ridiculous it
[1:22:30] was. He looked at who gave the
[1:22:34] promise in the name of the Lord. And
[1:22:37] then he says, "It depends on what you
[1:22:40] are looking
[1:22:41] at. If you are looking at the
[1:22:45] giants, you were not able. But if you
[1:22:48] are looking at who gave the
[1:22:50] promise, you are more than able. Praise
[1:22:53] the name of the Lord. In
[1:22:55] Deuteronomy, chapter 1 verse
[1:22:58] 36, as I try to finish here, the
[1:23:01] scripture
[1:23:04] says, save the son of Jeff, he shall see
[1:23:08] it. And to him will I give the land that
[1:23:11] he hath trodden upon unto his children
[1:23:14] because he has
[1:23:16] wed the Lord.
[1:23:37] Amen. Amen. You see the reason why God
[1:23:40] is speaking about taking the
[1:23:43] land. He fold the Lord
[1:23:48] holy take a
[1:23:51] portion and leave another.
[1:23:54] Praise the name of the Lord. He followed
[1:23:56] the Lord in all that was revealed to
[1:23:58] him.
[1:24:00] That's why Jesus turned to the disciples
[1:24:03] and
[1:24:04] said to whom much is
[1:24:07] given much is expected. But whom little
[1:24:11] is given it is expected. So when he
[1:24:15] brings to you the
[1:24:16] revelation and you don't walk by
[1:24:19] it, praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:24:23] see, so the scripture continues and
[1:24:27] say searched the
[1:24:30] promises and stood in the promises like
[1:24:33] Abraham,
[1:24:35] calling the things that were not as
[1:24:37] though they were.
[1:24:39] The land he searched is what God gave
[1:24:41] him.
[1:24:44] The land he
[1:24:46] searched is what God gave
[1:24:49] him because he followed the Lord. Praise
[1:24:52] the name of the Lord. Where he
[1:24:55] went, the areas he walked
[1:25:00] through. Are we together
[1:25:02] friends? When we are praying, we have
[1:25:05] got in the
[1:25:07] spirit which mountains do we
[1:25:10] search when we come to church.
[1:25:13] and we sit down
[1:25:14] there. Which mountains are we
[1:25:18] searching? Are you picking it for the
[1:25:21] neighbor or you're taking it for
[1:25:23] yourself? Are you proclaiming the
[1:25:25] promises of
[1:25:26] God? Are you calling on the Holy Ghost
[1:25:30] to come and work in
[1:25:31] you? What are you searching? Are you
[1:25:34] seated here? Because the scripture tells
[1:25:37] us what where
[1:25:40] stood where he walked where his foot
[1:25:45] stood is what God gave
[1:25:48] him. So when we come here, we should
[1:25:52] come to search the
[1:25:53] land. And when we reach the promises to
[1:25:57] them that die in Christ,
[1:26:02] the promises to them that live in
[1:26:04] Christ, he says we shall be caught up
[1:26:08] when the rapture is taking place. It is
[1:26:11] them that are in Christ. Are you
[1:26:14] searching that promise this week? God
[1:26:16] will grant it unto you because he says
[1:26:20] where you put your
[1:26:22] foot, the mountain you search, that's
[1:26:25] what he gives to you. I just want to get
[1:26:28] here to finish
[1:26:29] up where we started from in the book of
[1:26:33] Joshua chapter
[1:26:35] 14 and then verse 16.
[1:26:42] So when they crossed the land when
[1:26:45] rather when they crossed
[1:26:47] Jordan after all those things that we
[1:26:50] have been sharing
[1:26:52] here Joshua and believing the Lord and
[1:26:55] following the word of the
[1:26:57] Lord walking with every every revelation
[1:27:00] that God gave
[1:27:02] them Joshua knew that God promised
[1:27:07] Abraham to give him the land. So he
[1:27:10] didn't, you know, deviate from the
[1:27:12] word, from the
[1:27:14] promise, but he walked with it. And the
[1:27:18] 10
[1:27:19] spies, they came back not respecting the
[1:27:23] word of
[1:27:24] God, but disbelieving
[1:27:27] it. You know like some of us maybe
[1:27:30] someone out
[1:27:32] there may say God
[1:27:34] said I'm meant to do
[1:27:37] this but as it's not applicable
[1:27:40] today it's a different
[1:27:43] generation you know yesterday we were
[1:27:45] talking to some brother out
[1:27:47] there and then we were
[1:27:49] sharing about the
[1:27:51] scripture the letters of Paul and then
[1:27:55] he was telling us that you see
[1:27:58] was writing to different
[1:28:00] churches according to their
[1:28:02] situations. So some of those
[1:28:05] things do not apply to us. And someone
[1:28:08] may stand and say that you see the
[1:28:11] prophet the things that he spoke they
[1:28:15] were in the in the in the
[1:28:18] 60s they don't apply
[1:28:22] now. That's the portion of the 10 spies.
[1:28:28] Praise the name of the Lord. They want
[1:28:30] to take a portion and they say the land
[1:28:33] we saw it is good.
[1:28:38] But the
[1:28:40] soldiers and the word that God gave to
[1:28:44] Abraham maybe it does not apply
[1:28:46] now. That's why they disbelieved it.
[1:28:50] Otherwise why would
[1:28:51] they you know begin to say that we are
[1:28:55] not able
[1:28:56] Yeah, they have walked. God has been
[1:28:58] with
[1:28:59] them crossing the Red Sea. It wasn't
[1:29:03] them. It was God. Praise the name of the
[1:29:06] Lord. They got in the wilderness. It
[1:29:09] wasn't them that provided the
[1:29:12] water. It was God. Praise the name of
[1:29:15] the Lord. And then they reach somewhere.
[1:29:18] And they say, "The God that has made us
[1:29:21] cross the Red Sea, that has given us
[1:29:24] meat in the
[1:29:26] wilderness, has given us the water in
[1:29:28] the wilderness, that has protected us
[1:29:31] from the wilderness, from the wild
[1:29:33] animals. He's not able to give us this
[1:29:36] land. Friends, we shouldn't stand
[1:29:40] there." So in Joshua
[1:29:45] 14:6, let's wind up
[1:29:48] The scripture says,
[1:29:51] "Then the children of
[1:29:53] Judah came unto Joshua in
[1:29:57] Gilgard, and the son of
[1:30:01] Jeff
[1:30:03] theite said unto
[1:30:06] him, thou knowest a
[1:30:09] thing that the Lord said unto
[1:30:13] Moses, the man of
[1:30:15] God concerning me,
[1:30:21] and praise the name of the
[1:30:23] Lord has a
[1:30:25] reference. He's saying God
[1:30:28] spoke. I'm here
[1:30:30] today to proclaim
[1:30:32] it. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:30:35] then he says in verse
[1:30:37] seven, 40 years old was I when Moses the
[1:30:40] servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh.
[1:30:51] to espy out the
[1:30:53] land. And I brought him word
[1:30:56] again as it was in mine
[1:30:59] heart.
[1:31:01] Nevertheless, my brethren that went up
[1:31:04] with
[1:31:06] me made the heart of the people
[1:31:09] melt. But I holy folded the Lord.
[1:31:16] Listen to the testimony of
[1:31:19] Calb in verse seven what he says. I
[1:31:23] brought him a word
[1:31:25] again as it was in my
[1:31:28] heart. Not as it was in the
[1:31:32] Bible, not as it was in the
[1:31:35] message. It had moved from the
[1:31:39] scrolls to the
[1:31:41] heart. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:31:44] Are we together friends? So even today
[1:31:48] you should move from the
[1:31:51] message to the
[1:31:53] heart and then you
[1:31:55] say as it is in my
[1:31:58] heart. Are we together friends? And then
[1:32:01] he continues and says that my
[1:32:05] brethren cause the
[1:32:08] reproach you know made the heart of the
[1:32:11] people to melt.
[1:32:14] And he says, "But
[1:32:15] I I f the Lord
[1:32:19] holy." Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:32:22] he continues and says, "And Moses swore
[1:32:25] on that
[1:32:27] day, saying, Surely the land where on
[1:32:30] thy feet have
[1:32:35] trodden shall be thine
[1:32:38] inheritance, and thy children
[1:32:41] is because thou has holy fold the Lord
[1:32:45] my
[1:32:47] God. And now, behold, the Lord hath kept
[1:32:50] me alive.
[1:32:53] as he
[1:32:55] said this 40 and five
[1:33:00] years. So, Calb also points
[1:33:03] out that even him being
[1:33:06] alive up to that day, it wasn't
[1:33:11] himself. It wasn't
[1:33:14] because you know he did specific things
[1:33:18] on some
[1:33:20] days. Maybe
[1:33:22] because he was so
[1:33:25] healthy. Maybe because he didn't drive a
[1:33:29] car that he couldn't get an
[1:33:32] accident. Maybe because you know there
[1:33:36] are many things that as of now are
[1:33:39] considered as risky
[1:33:42] things that can lead you to die. But
[1:33:46] says not because I watched my
[1:33:52] life. Praise the name of the Lord. But
[1:33:55] he says, "Behold, the Lord has kept me
[1:34:00] alive." That's a testimony that we
[1:34:02] should also have. Praise the name of the
[1:34:04] Lord. He says, "He has kept he has kept
[1:34:07] me alive for all these 40
[1:34:11] years." And then he says, "Ever since
[1:34:14] the Lord spake this word to
[1:34:19] Moses, where the children of Israel
[1:34:21] wandered in the wilderness,
[1:34:24] And he says now, "Lord, I am this day
[1:34:28] four and five years
[1:34:33] old." And then he says, "As yet I am as
[1:34:36] strong this day as I was in the day that
[1:34:39] Moses sent
[1:34:45] me." Praise the name of the Lord. Which
[1:34:48] man at
[1:34:50] 85? Which man at 85?
[1:34:54] ready to go to
[1:34:56] war. This man here still wasn't
[1:35:00] depending upon this
[1:35:02] flesh was looking
[1:35:04] up. Listen what he says
[1:35:07] now. He says in verse verse
[1:35:12] 12 maybe let's continue. He says as yet
[1:35:16] as as yet I am as strong this day as I
[1:35:18] was in the day that Moses sent me.
[1:35:25] As my strength was
[1:35:27] then strength now for
[1:35:32] both for both to go out and to come
[1:35:38] in. Now now
[1:35:41] therefore give me this mountain whereof
[1:35:44] the Lord spake in that
[1:35:46] day. For thou had in that
[1:35:50] day all the anime were
[1:35:54] there and and that that the cities were
[1:35:58] great and
[1:35:59] fed. If so
[1:36:03] be if so be the Lord will be with
[1:36:08] me then I shall be
[1:36:11] able to drive them out as the Lord
[1:36:15] side. He's still not standing upon this
[1:36:18] flesh. He's standing
[1:36:21] upon the
[1:36:23] Lord. He says, "If the
[1:36:25] Lord will be with me, praise the name of
[1:36:29] the Lord." That's the testimony of every
[1:36:32] Christian.
[1:36:35] If so, the Lord be with
[1:36:37] me, then I shall be
[1:36:40] able to drive them
[1:36:43] out as the Lord's
[1:36:45] side. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:36:49] everyone has a mountain. And if we are
[1:36:53] faithful and search these
[1:36:56] promises, following the Lord in all
[1:36:59] things while looking on the
[1:37:02] unseen, friends, God is more than
[1:37:06] able to give us the
[1:37:08] promises and the blessings and all
[1:37:11] things that are lied in his
[1:37:14] scriptures. All that we've got to do is
[1:37:17] to believe him and wait on him. Praise
[1:37:21] the name of the
[1:37:23] Lord. As I
[1:37:26] finish, just want to read you one one
[1:37:30] quote
[1:37:33] here. The prophet
[1:37:36] says in letting off the pressure,
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] letting off the
[1:37:43] pressure. Now
[1:37:46] today that's the refuge that we
[1:37:50] have. Look what
[1:37:52] happens when we are
[1:37:58] recognized. When we are
[1:38:01] recognized, he was our substitutionary
[1:38:04] death.
[1:38:07] When we realize it is not our
[1:38:11] righteousness but
[1:38:13] his when we accept him as our personal
[1:38:17] savior then we go to the grave with him
[1:38:21] in
[1:38:22] baptism and we die with
[1:38:25] him. If you
[1:38:27] don't you shouldn't be
[1:38:29] buried. So when you are
[1:38:32] dead and confess your
[1:38:35] sins and call yourself a
[1:38:38] sinner and ask for the
[1:38:41] mercy and are buried with
[1:38:44] Christ, we are also risen with him
[1:38:48] again. And now being raised from
[1:38:52] sin, being raised from the
[1:38:55] dead in the likeness of his
[1:38:58] resurrection, we are raised up from the
[1:39:01] life of
[1:39:04] sin and sitting with him in heavenly
[1:39:06] places
[1:39:08] and filled with the Holy
[1:39:10] Ghost with the evidence of eternal
[1:39:15] life that we are already raised
[1:39:18] up from the dead. Our souls are alive
[1:39:23] tonight with Christ because sin is
[1:39:27] beneath
[1:39:29] us and we've rised from
[1:39:33] there which is the
[1:39:36] earnest of our
[1:39:38] resurrection. Praise the name of the
[1:39:40] Lord. in the message God in his
[1:39:43] word. He
[1:39:48] says there is a good lesson right
[1:39:51] there for a minute. God is word said to
[1:39:57] Moses. Palestine belongs to the children
[1:40:00] of
[1:40:03] Israel. Palestine belong. Now God could
[1:40:07] could have went up there
[1:40:10] and could have went up
[1:40:13] there and shed every one of them free
[1:40:18] stains. So forth
[1:40:20] out then said come on
[1:40:24] Moses just come up and set
[1:40:27] down. What the prophet is trying to say
[1:40:30] here is that God would have taken
[1:40:35] Palestine,
[1:40:37] all the promised
[1:40:39] land and removed all the ans and
[1:40:44] everyone and called Moses and all the
[1:40:47] children of Israel, come and sit down
[1:40:51] here, you know. And then he says, "Sit
[1:40:55] down, take it easy." But Moses, Joshua,
[1:41:00] and
[1:41:01] Israel had to fight for every inch of
[1:41:03] the
[1:41:05] ground. And every promise in the book is
[1:41:08] yours, but God will never give it to
[1:41:11] you, and you lay back on a bed of
[1:41:15] ease. You for every inch you get.
[1:41:20] He told Joshua, "Every place the saw of
[1:41:25] your
[1:41:25] foot treads that I have given you."
[1:41:30] Footprints meant
[1:41:32] victory. And it is the same thing
[1:41:35] tonight. If you are
[1:41:38] paralyzed and can't wiggle a
[1:41:41] finger, say, "God, I want to wiggle a
[1:41:45] finger." That's right. You promised me I
[1:41:49] could do it. I'll lay there and wiggle
[1:41:54] till I do wiggle
[1:41:56] it. That's right. God made the promise.
[1:42:01] God, you told me I could put my
[1:42:04] foot on the floor. And here it comes.
[1:42:08] Here it comes. Yes, Lord. It's It's
[1:42:12] coming. Just keep on till you do put
[1:42:15] your foot on the
[1:42:19] floor. That is it. Fight for every inch.
[1:42:24] So when you realize the prophet was not
[1:42:27] talking
[1:42:31] about getting you know your fist ready
[1:42:33] to
[1:42:35] fighting in the
[1:42:38] word God you said you'll heal my leg I'm
[1:42:43] going to believe you and you step
[1:42:46] persistently you believe the word of God
[1:42:49] amidst all
[1:42:51] contradictions you stand there. That's
[1:42:54] where
[1:42:56] was among all the children of Israel, he
[1:43:00] had a mountain that belonged to him. And
[1:43:02] every one of us
[1:43:04] here, we have a mountain that belongs to
[1:43:07] us
[1:43:08] individually. All that we have to do is
[1:43:12] to get in the spirit of the Lord and
[1:43:15] search the storehouse of
[1:43:17] God and see the promises of God. And
[1:43:20] then we proclaim them there.
[1:43:23] Every day you call on the Lord. Lord,
[1:43:26] this is the mountain I'm I'm
[1:43:29] proclaiming. I'm climbing it. Lord gave
[1:43:31] it to me. You said it is mine. Not
[1:43:35] because of this, not because I'm
[1:43:39] better. But you said you'll do it. Just
[1:43:42] like
[1:43:43] salvation. You know, you know pastor,
[1:43:46] you know, teaches this it
[1:43:48] here. It's not what we have done.
[1:43:52] God has done
[1:43:54] it. God has done it. It's a mountain
[1:43:58] that God put for every
[1:44:00] elect. As long as you are an elect,
[1:44:03] salvation is yours. The Holy Ghost is
[1:44:06] your
[1:44:07] mountain. Proclaim him. Just call on
[1:44:10] him. Say, "This is the mountain I want
[1:44:13] today. This is my mountain. I'm not
[1:44:16] going to go away until you give him to
[1:44:18] me. It's not hard just to stand
[1:44:22] like as it was in my heart. Let the
[1:44:26] scriptures come in your heart. Let the
[1:44:30] message come in your heart. Not to walk
[1:44:34] with it, but to it to be in your heart.
[1:44:38] Say as it is in my
[1:44:40] heart. Believe it and I take it.
[1:44:44] Following the word
[1:44:46] holy, not to take a portion.
[1:44:49] and leave another or add unto it, but to
[1:44:53] walk with it the way it is revealed to
[1:44:57] you. Praise the name of the Lord. God is
[1:45:00] so
[1:45:01] gracious. I hope God has passed your
[1:45:04] way. Praise the name of the Lord. I
[1:45:08] didn't go this
[1:45:11] way. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:45:17] As we wind
[1:45:19] up, let's sing that song that
[1:45:23] says the father's
[1:45:26] love. How deep the father's love.
[1:45:34] How deep the father's love for us.
[1:45:42] was beyond all
[1:45:47] measure that he should give his only
[1:45:54] son to.
[1:46:02] Oh, how great the
[1:46:06] pal sing.
[1:46:10] Oh, the father turns his face
[1:46:17] away as wounds which mother
[1:46:23] chose
[1:46:25] one. Bring many sons to glory.
[1:46:34] Behold the man upon the
[1:46:41] cross. My sin upon his shoulders.
[1:46:47] [Music]
[1:46:50] A shame
[1:46:52] thy
[1:46:56] moing
[1:46:58] call among the
[1:47:04] sc it was my sin.
[1:47:11] Hallelujah.
[1:47:20] Oh,
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:30] I know that.
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:38] I will not
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:48:01] boast. Oh
[1:48:02] yes, his day.
[1:48:05] and raise our
[1:48:09] lamb.
[1:48:11] Oh, why should I guide from his
[1:48:19] reward? I
[1:48:22] cannot give a doubt.
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] This I know with all my
[1:48:37] heart. These words are upon
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:43] my Let's repeat that again.
[1:48:46] I will not bo
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:49:00] just
[1:49:01] like how he stood before Joshua
[1:49:08] and said if God be with me
[1:49:13] I'll be able to drive all the kids out
[1:49:15] of the
[1:49:17] As we are going to pray this moment,
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:28] oh my God.
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:47] Hallelujah. How
[1:49:51] my
[1:49:53] soul. Just take time and speak to the
[1:49:57] Lord. Take time and speak to the
[1:50:01] Lord. For before you is a
[1:50:05] mountain. Before you is a
[1:50:07] blessing. Before you is a promise.
[1:50:11] And many times like we have seen in the
[1:50:15] word that he brings a certain
[1:50:18] pattern in the wilderness.
[1:50:21] And he says get in the
[1:50:23] spirit and search the
[1:50:25] storehouse. The mountain that you
[1:50:28] choose, the mountain that you walk
[1:50:30] upon that I will give you if you follow
[1:50:35] my word on it. Oh, praise the name of
[1:50:37] the Lord.
[1:50:40] He loves us so
[1:50:42] much that he hold us.
[1:50:46] He holds
[1:50:47] us with his hands. It is not you
[1:50:52] holding. It is the Lord holding
[1:50:55] you. No one. The scripture
[1:50:58] says, "What shall separate us from the
[1:51:02] love of God?
[1:51:05] Will it be
[1:51:07] tribulations,
[1:51:09] persecution?
[1:51:10] Nothing. Because it is him that is
[1:51:13] holding
[1:51:14] us. Any promises that he has
[1:51:17] given is coming daily to fulfill
[1:51:21] it. Oh, praise the name the name of the
[1:51:24] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be
[1:51:28] the name of the Lord.
[1:51:30] Heavenly
