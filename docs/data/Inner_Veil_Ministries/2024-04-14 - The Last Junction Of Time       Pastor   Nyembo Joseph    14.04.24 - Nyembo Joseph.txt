mom is a he's my uncle and my mothers are here God bless you too much God bless you you may be seated have you been blessed in the service amen God bless you for taking your time to be here you see one time when Thomas was not around when Jesus came he missed the Revelation so let us always be available when the church doors are open the brother told us this message is God himself and this message was God the omnipotent to come down and meet with another omnipotent amen at the seventh Junction because we've had seven Junctions by you know different men God has used but on the seventh amen it was Malachi 4 so at the seventh Junction God and man became one and that's what Malachi demonstrated in his ministry he spoke things in existence the omnipotent power natural man had become one so that the maturity of this age amen will be God becoming one with the entire bride amen so he still the omnipotent and you are Theon and God coming down to join with the bride in the BM of the Holy Ghost at this time all things are possible at this time all things are possible that's why we have Look Away to Jesus amen and the third pool is here at the same point so when the omot met with Brother Bram all things were possible because he gave him the same anointing the same power the same Miracles the same signs and wonders and I believe that the same anointing and power and authority is now manifesting through the brother was laboring to tell you that brother Bram didn't go home with that anointing he left it back and that's our inheritance God bless you thank you for being here brother Moses do you love him amen so you just believe if you stood here you came because you you had a desire and let's just believe that this desire will be manifested as an answer to prayer amen so on our chat room I'm going to send you some quotes on that omnipotent meeting with one day after another gives us something to feed on and you happy that's another thing we are going to feed on realize that when God comes into Union with you god makes you anent before all situations when that one happens all things are possible God bless you amen amen just some few announcements I've been told to pass them over to you I was told to pass them over to you by the pastor of the flock amen this Saturday we are having praying and fasting you're all welcome amen then next Sunday we are going
