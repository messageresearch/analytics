together Lord in the name of the Lord can turn to our Bibles praise the name of our Lord I just want to take only one hour God being gracious say that we give enough room for the Breen who are traveling far so we got the Book of John Chapter 13 John Chapter 13 and then we are reading from verse S Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but thou sh know here Peter said unto him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou shall have no part with me Simon P said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed needeth not s to wash his feet but is clean every weight and you are clean but not for you know who for he knew who should betro him therefore said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I your master Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you very I say to you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know the things happy are you if you do them his word you may seated so I want to preach on the subject in verse 15 it says I have given you an example praise the name of the Lord I have given you an example praise the name of our Lord and we know that our Lord Jesus Christ whatever he said in his word he demonstrated it he was showing whatever he was saying when he said love your enemy he demonstrated that he loved his enemy when he said be meek he demonstrated being me because whatever he was saying was part of him praise the name of our Lord and he said okay you call me master you call me Lord but I have humbled myself and then I have given you an example and then he tells us that we should also do the same to others praise the name of our Lord he gave us an example of a righteous life he gave us an example you know of sacrificing ourselves he gave us an example in everything and now the Lord has called us he also wants us to be examples that we can be examples to others when you at your home he wants you to be an example at your home when you at your place of work he wants you to be an example at your place of work and then we have a number of ministers God also wants you to be an example to your church praise the name of our Lord he has given us an example and you know as long as God has given you a responsibility as long as God has given you a role that means that there is something that you keep on doing now in whatever you're doing people are watching you people are depending upon you praise the name of our Lord like how do we handle the Affairs that have been given to us maybe if you par how what example are you giving to your children you stay in a certain Community what example are you giving to your neighbors so Christ says he has given us an example and it is also necessary for us to be good examples to the others praise the name of our Lord he wants us also to show good examples to others praise the name of our Lord now in the message the spoken word is the oral brother Bram say if you want a church start with the word of God you want life you want you want life of God start with the word of God accept the word of God in its fullness every measure of it and if that is the fullness of God in you then the rain that falling will produce exactly what's in the your garden praise the name of the Lord he says if you want life there is a source of Life praise the name of our Lord God has given us his wife and then from the word we receive life praise the name of our Lord he continues to say where is your latter R coming up at you see where that's going after a while going over them World gos that Elijah got they thought they got GS or the man them School of the prophets them denominations had gathered some World GS and they thought they were peace then the works will be manifested in him the works will be the works will be manifested in him are the same for it is the same seed word of God God son was his example seed so now Christ came as the Son of God and then we are also the children of God so we we have an example SE through our Lord Jesus Christ that you know we have what to look to we have where to get our influence from praise the name of our Lord you have something that influences so then you need to take the word of God and when you have the word of God then the word of God Be Your influence let the word of God be established in you now if you don't have the word of God then you'll draw influences from some other you get examples from wrong things and when you get examples from wrong things then you will pattern by that praise the name of our Lord you will pattern by that but now God wants us to have to take Christ as our example praise the name of our Lord the Bible talks about Jezebel and when Jezebel became the queen of Israel she took over the governance of the kingdom and then she was and then the Bible says Jezebel she produced daughters and now some of the daughters also became Queens to other Kingdom and now when they became Queens they also taught those places out to worship idols so now we see that Jezebel was a wrong example you know mothers as Pastor has been teaching us this morning you are an example you are un influenced your children un influenced your family then what kind of influence do you give praise the name of our Lord nowadays when you walk on the streets you get an elderly woman just dressing with short things tight things and he's moving with his daughter and then the daughters addressed the same praise the name of our so if the mother was maybe a prostitute then what would expect of the daughters jeel was worship she also produced Idol worshipers praise the name of our Lord until she brought the kingdom of Judah to destruct the king of Judah to be killed praise the name of our Lord when the daughter married the king of Judah and then the king of Judah was destroyed praise the name of so now God has given us a good example and he wants us to take that right example also become examples to others praise the name of our Lord now let us go to the book of First Timothy chter 4 praise the name of our Lord First Timothy 4 and then verse 9 the B says this is a faithful saying and worth of all acceptation for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially those these things command and teach praise the name of our Lord then says let no man despise your youth but be though an example of the Believers in the word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith inity praise the name of the Lord so the Bible is saying we have received the word and when we have received the word we need to obey that word and that word will make us examples to others praise the name of the Lord as a believer are an example to the nonbelievers as a pastor are an example to your congregation as a husband I an example to your family as a mother I example to your children you know as a Christian an example to the community where are you living Jesus says he has given us an example and he also wants us to be examples something that has a good influence praise the name of the Lord where by the Bible is telling us you are an example in the word of God you are an example in the conversation in other words in your conduct your conduct is a good example you an example in charity you an example in the spirit of God an example in faith if somebody comes to you and then they have troubles will you discourage them Father ah that problem nobody can handle oh that thing now you can't manage or you increase their faith to trust in God you know the Bible tells us when we go to First Peter chapter 3 praise the name of our Lord the Bible says in verse one likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husband that if obey not the word they also May without the word be wared by the conversation of the wives now the Bible is telling us as a Christian wife as a Christian Child your conduct can win people to Christ when you are a good example in your community praise the name of our Lord so you need to see that the life you live is according to the word of God praise the name of our Lord the problem we are living we are living in a time where we have a lot of wrong things than what is right we have a lot of fake things than what is correct we have a lot of Darkness than what light is there and now the problem is if you also go with the wrong side you will become a reproach you bring a r to Christ praise the name of our Lord so God want to be good examples examples praise the name of our Lord Christ has given us an example so he wants us to be examples to the people that we live in now in the message the oncoming storm he says there is only two things that is you are either a Believer or unbeliever praise the name of our Lord and you know the Bible says that by their fruits we shall know them not their confession but by their fruits not what they call themselves praise the name of our Lord but by their fruits so what fruit do you give because the tree is known by the fruit now if the tree does not produce fruit what is it identity praise the name of our Lord not you have lost your identity you are not show you're not giving the fruit of Christ so now your identity is the fruit so he says if you are a Believer you do not those things if you do them I don't know what kind of profession you have but if you do that the love of God isn't in you What's happen with the projector praise the name of the Lord he says if you don't do that the love of God isn't in you the Bible says we've got too much profession without a possession of it what what you are what you are not Christ didn't do that Jesus confessed what he was and Jesus want us confess what praise the name of our Lord if you some a message believer then you follow the word of God if you a message believer then you don't behave like the denomination of pra the name of if you a message believer then be like the message walk in the message dress like the message live like the message praise the name of We Are living in a terrible time that somebody speaks to you not to know the truth from you that's how to trap you that's the problem we have the way they were coming to Jesus Christ then they asked him this man Cesar you know is he giving us a lot of taxes is not doing good then they wanted to trap Jesus the concern was not about the taxes but the concern was what caus what blame they would get with Jesus Christ they bring the woman who was caught in adulter what do you say not for them to be delivered not for the woman to be forgiven but to get an accusation against and that's the mind of many people is the what they speak is not what they mean in but that's not Christ praise the name of our Lord that's not an example of Christ we need to see that our confession is the same as our life we live when I say yes let it be yes let my not not my to be no praise the name of the Lord then he says we've got too much profession without a position too many too many saying are not leaving it I think even we have two much practice on sermons and not leaving enough sermon you are preaching but you are what you are preaching is your life really contrary to what you are speaking and the Bible says brother those arees were drama they do th what they were not you cannot be an example when you like that praise the name of our Lord be a real Pastor praise the name of our follow what the word says about you if you a Believer be a genuine believer praise the name of our Lord then he says I think even we have too much practice on sermons are not leaving enough sermons would be a lot better if we lived our sermons each one of us would be a minister now what is he saying that if you a Believer and you are following the word of God the life that you live is ministering praise the name of the Lord the life that you are living is ministering when they want love you are written a piece of love not a theory praise the name of our not a theory but a life that is lived and that's what Christ has given unto us then he says it's better to leave me a seron then preach me one praise the name of he says leave me that you have not only speaking what you are not when Christ demonstrated it and he said what I have done to you do to others praise the name of the Lord so we need to challenge ourselves the life that I'm living what example am I giving out praise the name of the Lord how will people believe you how will they believe you when you live contrary to the message how will they believe you when you live contrary to the word of God praise the name of our Lord when you say this you don't mean it you are deceiving how would they take you serious praise the name of our Lord so he says leave me a someon instead of preaching to me one praise the name of our Lord the Bible say you are written Epistles of God read of all men praise the name of our Lord so it's best to live the have the life over the sermon praise the name of the Lord let somebody take you at your word when you say tomorrow let it be so when you say this let it be so not politics I told him I want I wanted to get way through leave me Aon praise the name of our Lord leave me a sermon give me a good example that I can follow and this is what Paul is telling Timothy be an example to the Believers in your conduct in your words in whatever you do and this is what the Lord wants from us the Bible says praise the name of our Lord in MTH 5 MTH 5 verse 13 He says you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his saver where with shall it be salted good for nothing but to be cast out to be troen under the foot of men now if you lose your sness as a Christian the life of Jesus Christ the Bible says you are worth to be stepped on because useless you are troen down praise the name of in other words you are not carrying the true name but you are taking a different name praise the name of our Lord so he says you are the light of the world a city that set on Hill cannot be he neither do men light a candle and put it under a bullsh but on a Candlestick that it gives its light unto to all that are in the house praise the name of the Lord so your light The Life of Christ should be manifested in us what example are we giving praise the name of the Lord what example are we giving you know when the children go to nurser schools the teachers demonstrate to them what they talking about when he says one he brings an orange he says this is one then when he brings another put them together they're demonstrating says two praise the name of our Lord you know there was radio there is a program on the radio used to play after radio programs every Tuesday and then it was called Lively mind and you know they would teach people people even have never gone to school how to teach their children to come how about us we need to teach people don't know Christ that this is how Christ lived praise the name of our Lord by giving them an example example of Good Conduct examp in prayer example in Waiting upon the Lord example in reading out the word of God praise the name of our Lord now if you can't expect them praise the name of our Lord to do what you failing to do Yourself Praise the name of our Lord and then we need to challenge ourselves praise the name of our Lord like many times you go to the churches in the missionary F and then you find a pastor doesn't even how to know to read his Bible then what does he preach praise the name of our Lord when they get to read the scripture the pronunciation is contrary to what it is saying praise the name of the Lord what is he preaching or he just goes and gets something some story and then he brings it to the people praise the name of the Lord and then there are those who have got church Edge books years ago before but they are either on chapter one on chapter two then what what are you ministering when the Bible has told us let us be an example in that scripture in first Timothy First Timothy chapter 4 verse 12 but be though an example of believer in word where do you get your word from when you don't read it praise the name of where do you get your inspiration if you don't read and you don't wait on the Lord and then don't listen when the Bible says in Revelations chapter 1 verse3 blessed are they that read praise the name of our and here the word written in the book and do them now there are those who can read There are those who can hear but they don't do it that's not a good example praise the name of our Lord where we have read in John Chapter 13 in John 13 verse1 17 praise the name of our Lord let us go back there the scripture says if you know these things so how will you know them you know the things by reading them by hearing them very good you have read it very good you've heard it but the Bible says happy are you if you do them praise the name of our Lord that's what God is calling us he calling us to a higher level praise the name of the Lord a higher level where we have known these things and if we have known these things he wants to see the life in us the life of Jesus CHR praise the name of our Lord we need to go beyond the beginnings praise the name of our Lord the Bible says we need to go to Perfection more excellent way if you have been hearing thank you for hearing but he also wants you to read praise the name of our Lord if you have been reading thank you for reading but he wants you to oby those to become a written EP let them become the life of Jesus himself and then you can be a good example to the others praise the name of the Lord you know brother Bram when he saw the church or the bride in preview when the bride of Christ was being presented praise the name of our Lord he didn't see their Bibles he didn't see the books of the message of the TS he saw individuals who had become the life of those and that's where our Redemption is that's where our deliverance is if we take these things and live the life of these things that's being a good example praise the name of our Lord it says if you know this things happy are you if you do them so he he wants us to manifest it praise the name of our Lord now in Mark chapter 13 and then verse 37 praise the name of our Lord Mark 13:37 he says and what I say unto you I say unto to all praise the name of our so each of us has been given a responsibility to take the word of God serious in our lives he says what I say unto you I say unto all praise the name of the Lord so we have no excuse he has given us an example an example of what we need to do praise the name of our Lord now in the message the choosing of a bride he says character there was never there never was a character like Jesus Christ it lives in you and manifest him we see it is true it's not world beauty of him that attracts his bride it is his character the character of the church that Jesus looks for not where it's big buildings where it's a great domination a big membership he promised to meet with whe whe whether they are two or three are gathered together that's where the True Believer rest his hope is upon that word of God being Vindicated in truth praise the name of our so he says there was never a character like Jesus Christ he gave us an example he gave us what we need to do he demonstrated to us what we need to do praise name of our Lord Jesus showed us how to live a holy life Jesus showed us how to overcome Temptation Jesus showed us how to forgive one another Jesus showed us how to pray how to be obedient because he was born a son so he had to be obedient to the word of God he offered himself he offered himself and that was an example he was giving to us and he says I have given you an example now the question comes back us what examples are we giving what example are we giving at our homes what examples are we giving to our churches what examples praise the name of the Lord and you find that if if you as a a family and you not serious on something then the the whole family is not serious praise the name of our Lord or as a pastor you not serious on this they will also not be serious praise the name of if you have not got Grace to do it then who will get the grace to do it it's not that you have not got the grace but you have rejected it [Music] you're not being obedient praise the name of our Lord that's how we get the Grace by being obedient to the word of and then you see God gives you the ability to live the life of his word praise the name of our Lord by yielding to God and then you see God takes you from one step another one step to another and then you find yourself completely changed completely transform you know you surrender like Christ he said thy will oh God that's what I'm going to do and this is what the Lord wants also from us that we can seek the will of God we can depend upon the Lord that the Lord may change our lives Christ gave us an example and brother Bram has told us that Christ he was such a character and his attraction was not the beauty his attraction was his character what is our character what do people talk about praise the name of the Lord what do they talk about you how are you known where you live do you how are you known where you live praise the name someone who abusing or someone who is very careless those are the kind of names that you receive because the name show the very in you those are the examples that you give to people then how would they take the example of Christ if for you the example you give the sermon you leave is contrary to [Music] Christ praise the name of our Lord what is the example you are giving praise the name of the Lord he's coming for a church without spot or wrinkle praise the name of our Lord now what you need to do is just surrender yourself like David when the prophet told him you are the man David didn't start arguing you don't you know that I'm a King David said Lord have mercy upon me praise the name of David said Lord forgive me and then the prophet told God has forgiven he has taken away your sin and you're not going to die praise the name of our Lord and you see these things which are contrary to the word of God they make us dead in Christ you have no identity of Christ you have the identity of the enemy praise the name of it's just like a woman producing a child resembling the [Laughter] neighbor no identity of the father at home we shouldn't have be Children of the neighbor you behave like the neighbor you hate like the neighbor praise the name of our Lord but we need to Love Like Our Father praise the name of our Lord we need to forgive like Christ we need to forbear with one another like Christ not the neighbor praise the name of our Lord Pastor was preaching last Sunday how these trees are inter Tred and if lacked discernment instead of picking from the Tree of Life she picked from the Tree of knowledge of God and she manifested that character but God has given us the blood of Jesus Christ that we can have true discernment praise the name of our that we can have the Life of Christ himself that is manifested in us the name of and having the life of Jesus Christ is not something difficult it's not complicated Just Surrender yourself give your life to God let him take over and say Lord here I am help me and then you continue following and then you'll see the life change it's not difficult praise the name of our Lord allow the word to settle in your heart and then the word itself produce itself in your life praise the name of our lord it's not difficult praise the name of our Lord so Jesus gave us a character now in the message raising Jar's daughter he says oh how wonderful then this Maniac run down to him and the Lord Jesus rebuked them spirits and a lot of people said that religion will run you crazy not the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ it won't it will give you right mind praise the name of our Lord that's what Jesus does when he comes in your life he will give you a right mind right thinking right speech right conduct praise the name of our Lord it will give you right mind and you are not in your right mind until you have met the Lord Jesus and that should be our desire praise the name of our Lord is to meet the Lord Jesus Christ and when you meet the Lord Jesus Christ don't leave him there like the Rich Young Ruler praise the name of our Lord Rich met Christ he R he knelt down when Jesus told if you are going to do better what you need to do sell all that you have and then come and follow and that is the same basis we all meet Christ praise the name of our Lord even Abraham that was the same basis God told Abraham leave your country leave your inheritance Jesus was telling this man leaving your Earthly inheritance that will give you a better inheritance God told Abraham leave your land come and I show you another one praise the name of and Abraham obeyed but the rich man he said no no no no he refused so you can't be a good example if you have rejected him praise the name of our Lord you need to take him to accept him in your heart let him come and settle in your heart let him come be your savior not only your savior but even your lord he rules over your mind he rules over your words he rules over your actions praise the name of our Lord that's what the Lord wants and so when you have met him and is within you he will change you praise the name of our Lord he will change you in John chter 14 and then in verse 21 he says he that has my Commandments keeps them it is he that loveth me and he that loveth me shall beloved of my father and I will love him and I will manifest myself to him so the Bible says if you have his Commandments and you keep them so you may have them but you don't keep them praise the name of our now keeping how do you keep like if you have money and then you put here your money and then you go to town do you know how to keep money you have the money but you don't know how to keep it why there are people who are interested in it and the Bible say the seed that fell on the West Side praise the name of our Lord the seed that fell on the west side and the west side was a a condition of the heart the Bible says the birs came and stole it and the birs are demons Satan steals the word of God so if your heart is the wor side you you're not keeping the word praise the name of our Lord but then your heart needs to be a good ground when your heart is a good ground then you going to keep the word praise the name of the Lord let us read in in Luke chapter 8 Luke chapter 8 and then the Bible says in in verse 15 but that on the good Ground Luke 8:1 15 are they which in an honest and good heart praise the name of our Lord honest and a good heart now a honest heart is a repentant heart praise the name of our Lord because that's honest a honest heart is a repentant heart if I done mistake Lord have Mery upon like David he had a honest heart when you read in 51 he said Lord when you speak you are Justified he didn't start arguing he said I acknowledge my fault that was a honest heart so even you in your condition if you do something wrong God wants you to be honest and say Lord have mercy upon Lord have done something wrong so that's why the Bible saying that a good ground is a honest heart so even a good ground you can falter you can do mistakes but when you do those things he wants you to be honest Lord have mercy upon you he wants you to be repentant good ground then he says is a Hest and good heart and having heard the word what do they do they keep it the West Side heart when they heard the word they never kept it the birs of unbelief came Demons of unbelief came and took it but then the Bible says having heard the word they keep it how do you keep the word by believing the word how do you keep the word by meditating upon the word how do you keep the word by testifying about how do you keep the word by obeying the word you are keeping it you are obeying it that's keeping the word you are thinking about the word that is keeping it you are you are walking according to the word that's keeping it so he says after they have heard the word they keep the word they don't lose it and they bring forth fruit with patience so the Bible has told us he that has my Commandments and he keepeth them it is he that loveth and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will come and manifest ourself to him so he manifest himself to us through revealing himself by answering our prayers he's manifesting himself by encouraging us he's manifesting himself to us praise the name of our Lord in John 14:23 he says Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our B with him baptism of the Holy Spirit he says if you keep my if you love me you will keep my word so where do you keep your the word of God David said I've kept Thy word in my heart that I may not sin against you praise the name of our Lord you keep it in your heart you believe it you obey it you follow it and then he says if you do that we will love him and we will come and make our AB in that person so the Spirit comes down where the word of God is praise the name of our Lord and the Holy Spirit will give you the ability to be example say that the life that you live is no longer your life praise the name of our Lord so you lose the identity of the neighbor praise the name of our Lord and you have the identity of God himself like in Antioch they lost the identity of the neighbor and the Bible say they were called Christians because they saw them live like Christ praise the name of our they were living the life of Christ in Acts 11 and verse 26 and when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch and it came to pass that aier they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch why do they call you at your place of work why do they call you in your village what they call you we need to show the identity of Jesus Christ he has given us an example praise the name of our Lord he has given us an example that we should follow the same praise the name of our Lord now in the message raising J's daughter he says why some people call themselves gentlemen but so beastly till they would throw a baby out of the mother's arm maybe weigh about 250 PBS of muscles like some kind of an animal that ain't a man that is a a beast man is not measured by his muscles or his sture a man is measured by his character whatever he is it is his character praise the name of the Lord what do people know about you praise the name of our Lord and you know there are some people are good to come in the public they are good but the wife will tell you what kind of [Music] husband people believe you outside how would they believe you oh my wife oh what is your character how do people what are you known by praise the name of but as children of God we have Christ as our example and we need to take the example of Jesus so he says man is not known by muscles oh how he appears but the character of Jesus Christ there was no beauty that as I said we should desire Jesus [Music] but was a character the Bible say even when we looked upon him there was no Beauty we should desire of him we would all turn our heads from him and everything but a character has never been measured to him and that's the example the Lord Jesus Christ and he wants us also to be examples at our homes in our churches among the people we live in our communi Christ wants his life reflected in Us Praise the name of our Lord just the Life of Christ to be reflected praise the name of our Lord and this is something that the Lord is looking forward to praise the name of our let us go to First Peter chapter as I try to finish 1 Peter verse 21 he says for even here un we are called because Christ also suffered for us giving us an example that we should follow his steps who did not sin neither was G found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed praise the name of our Lord the Bible says Christ gave us an example so we have what to follow and now if you have accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal then take that whole example of Christ let the word of God dwell in you richly being obedient to that word following that word the word says and then you allow God himself to come down in your life and he lives his own life praise the name of our Lord because the Bible say the fruit of the spirit but where does the spirit bear his fruit he doesn't bear his fruit in the air but he wants to come in you and then he will bear his own fruit in you praise the name of our Lord and whatever the Lord Jesus told us it's only him who can do it if we obey him he comes down and does his own work he comes down and does his own work when he said the works that I do shall you do also it seem in you to do the same works the life that I live you shall live it is in him who comes in you to live his own life we only need to yield and say Lord Here I Am Lord fill me with your Holy Spirit Lord fill me with your presence Lord direct me and then the Lord will take over your life and then you'll be able to live the life of Jesus chist no longer I that live it but the Lord Jesus that Liv we need to yield ourselves and say Lord here I am praise the name of our Daniel after he had shown you had been shown a vision he was too weak and was on the ground and then the angel was trying to speak to him then Daniel confessed oh my Lord I'm too weak there's no more strength in me I can't even hear you can imagine how weak you were that you can't even hear so you need energy to hear praise the name of it was too weak but he knew that there's something being spoken but I can't get it so he said Lord I'm too weak praise the name of our Lord he confessed his condition and when he confessed his condition the angel told him be strong praise the name of our Lord be strong praise the name of our Lord and the Bible say let the weak say I am strong not of my own ability but the ability that the Lord Jesus gives us and that's how we live the life of Jesus CH Christ say Lord I desire more of you Lord I need more of you to take over my life praise the name of our Lord if the life I've been living is not try give me Grace to live a better life that should be our desire Lord I Surrender myself Lord I yield myself Lord take over my life Lord I'm here to be changed praise the name of the Lord you take away your pride you take away your unbelief you take away your fear you take away your doubt and say Lord here I am change me Lord and make me new praise the name of our Lord and then you see the life of Jesus Christ coming to change Us Praise the name of our Lord and your own family they will give a testimony praise the name of our Lord like that song which says I am not the man I used to [Music] be if you father at home you used to be just rough your children say my father is now changed praise the name of Lord giving a right example praise the name of our Lord God wants us to be examples as Christ has given us an example then in the Book of James chapter 5 and then verse S praise the name of our Lord it says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husband man waiteth for the ious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it until he receive the early and the lat rain also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draws nigh [Music] not one against another Brethren Les you be condemned behold the judge stands before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you've heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy so the Bible says we have examples there are many examples we can look to in whatever station that we are going in whatever weakness that we have in whatever challenge that we have let us take them as examples look at job what he went through take him as an example look at you know the prophets what they went through take them as an example praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says we have a great cloud of witnesses there's nothing we are going through that others have not gone through so we are a good example and God wants us to take those examples and then live his life praise the name of our Lord he has given us an example then what examples are we in our families in the homes we live in the neighborhood places of work where we started from in our churches what examples are we Christ has given us an example but he wants us to be good example the Bible says we are amb Christ is ambassadors so what report are you giving do you have Heavenly influence in your life do you express the love of God to others you show The Life of Christ to others we are ambassadors ambassadors of Christ may God bless you amen am [Applause] Christ ambassadors we are Christ
