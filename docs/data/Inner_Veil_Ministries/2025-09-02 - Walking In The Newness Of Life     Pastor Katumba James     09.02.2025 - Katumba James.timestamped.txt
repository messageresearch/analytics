[23:47] times and every moment we Talk of the

[23:53] Uganda you are in the center of the
[23:55] focus of the message
[23:58] [Applause]

[24:11] round we have always had our
[24:14] celebrations
[24:18] Ina but this time we said let us make a
[24:25] shift and we thought of having
[24:28] celebration in
[24:33] ginger celebrating the
[24:36] [Applause]
[24:37] achievements of our
[24:40] family academic achievements of my wife
[24:44] academic achievements of my daughter
[24:48] Fai and there was nowh that we could
[24:54] celebrate without this church being
[24:57] represented
[25:00] because this is our fellowship when we
[25:03] are in
[25:07] chinger and you know you do not know
[25:10] what impact this church has had on my
[25:17] family every moment when we are down in
[25:21] campala we think about this
[25:26] church we know the Lord is doing a lot
[25:29] through
[25:32] you and any moment we go on our knees
[25:35] when we are praying we are praying for
[25:37] this
[25:40] church we like to appreciate God for
[25:44] Pastor James
[25:49] kba and our precious Pastor
[25:56] Ste and their
[26:00] families they mean a lot to
[26:03] us they have mentored my
[26:07] children and even when they are out
[26:11] there they have tried to replicate this
[26:18] church sometimes they are always given
[26:23] tasks and always ask them how does Ging
[26:28] Church do
[26:31] this so this has been a point for
[26:38] benchmarking you know sometimes you can
[26:41] be close to
[26:45] Gold close
[26:48] to but you may not know that you really
[26:51] have
[26:53] gold people from a
[26:58] every moment they
[27:00] cherish that which you
[27:03] have they talk about it they want to be
[27:07] close to
[27:08] it but you who is
[27:11] close you may not see
[27:13] it I pray that the Lord
[27:16] God who said beginning at
[27:21] Jerusalem he had a reason why he said
[27:23] beginning at
[27:26] Jerusalem and I than God that P chose to
[27:30] begin
[27:34] in because charity begins at
[27:39] home let's keep giving him strength and
[27:42] giving strength to Pastor
[27:46] Jac such that when they are out there
[27:48] they can lift that flag higher and
[27:54] higher I bring you greetings from my
[27:57] pastor
[28:01] and all the saints who knew of our being
[28:08] here and we are looking for a
[28:13] time when we shall when I will come
[28:16] specifically to have fellowship with you
[28:21] here because with my wife so long as
[28:24] she's best here she specifically comes
[28:26] for Fellowship here
[28:32] not long ago just I want to end with
[28:34] this testimony Pastor just let me give
[28:38] this
[28:40] testimony uh I've been in the civil
[28:44] service for a long
[28:47] time until last year around November
[28:50] when I
[28:54] retired but yet when you look at me I'm
[28:57] still young
[29:01] but I said not it is time for me to
[29:04] retire from the Civil
[29:08] Service and enter into the service which
[29:12] has no time
[29:17] limit it has no age
[29:20] limit it has no conditions
[29:24] set to hinder me to serve him
[29:29] and has been Joy on my
[29:32] heart for this time to
[29:35] come but before this time
[29:38] came some years ago when I was a
[29:43] teacher on the
[29:47] blackb I was in
[29:51] prayer and something
[29:54] happened and it was hard for me to
[29:56] believe
[29:59] that it would
[30:01] come because I didn't know how to go
[30:03] about
[30:08] it but right there in
[30:11] prayer I was caught up in a
[30:14] vision and the Lord spoke to
[30:17] me and told me I have made you a head
[30:22] teacher
[30:24] amen this is several years ago
[30:29] and I said
[30:30] God how will I so much salt from the
[30:33] Blackboard to that
[30:37] office but about two three years
[30:41] ago when I was substantive
[30:46] Deputy I didn't know that the Lord was
[30:49] out to fulfill this before I can
[30:55] retire but just as he
[30:58] spoke he brought it to come to
[31:03] pass I've given this
[31:06] testimony for some of you who are
[31:08] struggling with your
[31:12] status God remains
[31:16] true even when it is remaining one
[31:19] day he will fulfill
[31:22] it
[31:24] otherwise I I'm here to enjoy the
[31:27] service
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:36] you appreciate
[31:39] brother
[31:42] amen certainly one day we shall find out
[31:45] when he will be in
[31:47] ginger and then we shall have him come
[31:49] and minister to
[31:51] us amen do you appreciate the
[31:55] testimony amen amen really thank God a
[32:00] lot was said
[32:02] yesterday by hope and then by

[47:31] children glory and hon of your name in
[47:35] the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:37] this amen amen let us go to Romans
[47:41] 6 we're reading from verse one to verse
[47:46] 4 I was wondering I had something to
[47:49] preach in the course of the
[47:53] week then when I reach this morning
[47:56] and then I was wondering what should I
[47:59] Minister and then what was in my heart
[48:02] turned
[48:04] away and then I got something new
[48:08] here which I believe will be of blessing
[48:10] to all of
[48:12] us in Romans 1 vers Romans 6 verse1
[48:19] verse4 the Bible says what shall we say
[48:24] then shall we continue in sin that Grace
[48:27] May
[48:31] abound God
[48:32] for how shall we that are dead to sin
[48:37] live and no longer
[48:44] therein know ye not that so many of us
[48:48] as were baptized into Christ were
[48:51] baptized into his death
[49:01] therefore we are buried with him by
[49:04] baptism into death that as Christ was
[49:07] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[49:10] the father even so we also should walk
[49:13] in the new of life
[49:29] May word you may be
[49:33] seated so this
[49:35] morning we want share on walking in the
[49:38] newness of
[49:42] Life walking in the newness of
[49:46] Life praise the name of our Lord and I
[49:50] believe the Lord will give us
[49:52] Grace praise the name of our Lord to
[49:56] understand our Christian
[49:58] walk from the very
[50:01] beginning praise the name of the Lord
[50:04] now newness of
[50:06] life that means it is the life of Jesus
[50:11] Christ praise the name of the Lord and
[50:14] you can never be a true
[50:20] Christian you can never be a true
[50:22] message
[50:25] believer without the life of Jesus
[50:29] Christ without the life of Jesus
[50:32] Christ you have not
[50:34] started praise the name of the Lord
[50:37] You've not
[50:38] started so he brings it right at the
[50:43] beginning praise the name of our Lord
[50:45] and so that's why Jesus told the
[50:49] apostles that don't go
[50:51] out unless you wait
[50:57] in
[50:58] Jerusalem for the spirit of God himself
[51:01] to come
[51:03] down when they were with Jesus Christ
[51:07] they were not
[51:08] converted but now when the spirit of God
[51:11] came down on the day of
[51:14] Pentecost then they were
[51:18] converted and then you'll see that a
[51:20] number of places in the
[51:23] scriptures as long as people had the
[51:26] word of God of that
[51:30] time praise the name of our Lord like
[51:32] when we can start the story from the
[51:34] book of Act
[51:37] 2 there were people who were at
[51:40] Jerusalem and then when they saw the
[51:44] apostles and all the
[51:46] 120 you know they were speaking in
[51:49] Tong you know then they were saying
[51:51] these people must have drunk new wine
[51:55] but it was in the morning
[51:57] and then when Peter preached to them
[52:00] about the Fulfillment of the
[52:03] scriptures they were
[52:06] convicted and so that's the same thing
[52:09] that the the Holy Spirit
[52:12] does you know our interface with the
[52:15] Holy
[52:16] Spirit you start interfacing with the
[52:19] Holy
[52:22] Spirit right when you are still a sinner
[52:27] and it is the holy
[52:29] spirit that anoints a
[52:32] minister to preach to you the
[52:35] gospel it's the Holy Spirit and when the
[52:38] Holy Ghost is using a
[52:41] minister and then that same Holy
[52:44] Spirit that's using the minister to
[52:47] speak the word of
[52:49] God the same holy spirit that comes down
[52:54] in your
[52:55] heart brings conviction in your
[52:58] heart so you the Holy Ghost starts
[53:01] dealing with your
[53:04] life right at the beginning when you are
[53:06] still a
[53:08] sinner the Holy Ghost does not wait from
[53:12] afar he actually send the
[53:15] minister and then he anoints the
[53:17] minister to speak particular words to
[53:20] your
[53:21] life and now when those words are spoken
[53:24] to your life
[53:26] you are
[53:28] convicted it is the holy spirit that
[53:31] convicts you you don't convict yourself
[53:35] and now when you get
[53:37] convicted then you say Lord what shall I
[53:41] do like on the of
[53:44] Pentecost asking what shall we
[53:47] do men and Brethren then what did Peter
[53:50] tell them repent every one of
[53:54] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[53:58] Christ for the remission of your
[54:01] sin and you shall
[54:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that
[54:06] was the spirit speaking to them and so
[54:09] now when they
[54:10] repented and they were
[54:12] baptized the Bible says
[54:16] 3,000 were added to the church how are
[54:20] they added to the church they received
[54:22] the baptism of the holy
[54:24] spirit for them they didn't have again
[54:26] to wait another 10
[54:29] days it wasn't that it's the moment you
[54:33] receive the
[54:34] word and obey the word the spirit right
[54:38] away
[54:39] comes praise the name of the Lord It's
[54:42] Only in a place where Philip went to
[54:46] Samaria and then they had to
[54:50] wait Peter and John coming to play their
[54:53] hands on them
[54:56] other
[54:58] places why did that happen in
[55:00] Samaria because Peter had the
[55:03] keys he had
[55:06] open he had he open the Holy Ghost on
[55:09] the day of
[55:11] Pentecost to the Jews then in Acts 8 he
[55:17] opened the Holy Ghost to the
[55:20] samarians acts 10 he open the Holy Ghost
[55:25] to the Gentiles
[55:27] and now from that
[55:30] time the moment you obey the word of
[55:33] God and you do what the word of God is
[55:36] telling you the Holy Ghost comes
[55:39] down praise the name of the Lord that's
[55:41] what the scripture
[55:43] is praise the name of the Lord now let
[55:46] us go in this
[55:49] message he
[55:52] says in the message Church age
[55:57] and anoint thine eyes with i s that th
[56:00] may
[56:04] see now that one is picking it from
[56:07] Revelations
[56:10] 3 praise the name of our Lord
[56:12] Revelations
[56:17] 3 and then Verse
[56:20] 18 he says I canel the to buy of me gold
[56:24] tried in the fire that thou may be rich
[56:28] and white rment that thou may be clothed
[56:31] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[56:34] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[56:37] iel that thou mayest
[56:42] see Verse
[56:47] 18 Revelations 3:8
[57:13] then he says let us go back to the
[57:15] church age
[57:17] book that is Page
[57:21] 352 and then paragraph
[57:24] three he say and anoint th eyes with i
[57:28] that may
[57:32] see then brother says he does not
[57:37] say that you have to buy this
[57:42] iave that's a very interesting
[57:45] thing praise the name of the Lord oh
[57:50] no there is no price
[57:54] tag on the Holy
[57:57] Spirit that's what saying there's no
[58:01] price
[58:03] St on the Holy Ghost In other words God
[58:08] does not say you first go and do this
[58:10] then I give you the holy
[58:12] GH it's not that there's no price
[58:17] T want you to pick
[58:21] it you
[58:24] Ty there is no price t on the Holy
[58:29] Ghost okay right there that's good he
[58:32] says there is no price
[58:36] tag on the Holy
[58:38] Ghost it is freely
[58:43] given how is it
[58:46] given just
[58:49] obedience praise the name of the Lord
[58:51] just
[58:53] obedience praise the name of the Lord
[58:56] doesn't attach anything on the baptism
[58:58] of the Holy
[59:00] Spirit other than
[59:03] obedience so the question is if you say
[59:07] you don't have the Holy
[59:09] Ghost for one
[59:12] year two
[59:13] years years four years years does it me
[59:19] that you've not been
[59:22] obeying then why are you
[59:25] walking praise the name of but he says
[59:28] there is no price
[59:31] St he's not demanding you go and do this
[59:35] [Music]
[59:36] year this year Peter told them just
[59:41] repent and repent means you acknowledge
[59:44] your
[59:47] weaknesses it means you know your
[59:50] condition Lord this is my
[59:53] station Lord have mercy upon me Lord
[59:56] forgive
[59:57] me and now when you receive that word
[1:00:02] and Obey that
[1:00:03] word then the Holy Ghost comes down he
[1:00:07] says there's no
[1:00:09] price praise the name of the Lord no
[1:00:12] price on the Holy Ghost it is freely
[1:00:18] given praise the name of but now when
[1:00:21] you when you look at this other the same
[1:00:23] scripture in Romans in Revelations
[1:00:25] chapter 1
[1:00:29] and verse it says I the to buy me of
[1:00:34] gold tried in the
[1:00:41] fire and brother says
[1:00:45] this is
[1:00:48] character and
[1:00:50] character you go through
[1:00:53] trials you go through a very
[1:00:57] fun so God does not take you through
[1:01:02] trials he does not take you through a
[1:01:05] very fun
[1:01:07] SP praise the name of Lord then he says
[1:01:10] now I can give you the
[1:01:11] Hol brother Bram says here there's no
[1:01:15] price on the on the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost then the scripture says what
[1:01:21] Pastor was reading last
[1:01:23] week Galatians 3:
[1:01:31] Mage
[1:01:33] church he says he does not say that you
[1:01:36] have to buy this ice
[1:01:39] Slave oh no there is no price tag on the
[1:01:43] Holy
[1:01:46] Spirit received you the Spirit by The
[1:01:49] Works of the law or by the hearing of
[1:01:51] Fai
[1:01:56] Galatians
[1:01:57] 3:2 then brother Bram says without the
[1:02:01] baptism of the Holy
[1:02:04] Ghost you can never have your eyes
[1:02:09] open to a true spiritual revelation of
[1:02:13] the
[1:02:16] word and without the
[1:02:20] spirit a man without the
[1:02:23] spirit is blind to God
[1:02:27] and his truth now you can find out
[1:02:32] yourself you can find out whether you're
[1:02:37] blind to God and His truth praise the
[1:02:42] name of our Lord now we shall understand
[1:02:44] as we go by
[1:02:46] and praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:02:49] the message you must be born
[1:02:52] again brother Bram says so now remember
[1:02:58] it didn't
[1:03:00] say you ought to be born
[1:03:05] again but you
[1:03:08] must now we as English speaking
[1:03:13] people understand what the word
[1:03:18] must means that is it is
[1:03:23] absolutely you've got to do
[1:03:27] it it is a
[1:03:29] must not you ought to you would better
[1:03:35] be off if you
[1:03:37] did but you must be born
[1:03:41] again or if would just take that
[1:03:45] word this morning and break it down what
[1:03:50] it means how that it is totally
[1:03:53] impossible
[1:03:56] and then if it is that
[1:03:58] essential and that
[1:04:01] great that it is totally
[1:04:04] impossible to enter in the Kingdom of
[1:04:08] Heaven or even to see
[1:04:11] it until you were born
[1:04:14] again and so many different
[1:04:19] interpretations of the word born
[1:04:22] again we all to see it
[1:04:26] we ought to seek it out with all our
[1:04:30] hearts and find out what it
[1:04:33] means so now Jesus told them let us go
[1:04:36] to John
[1:04:39] 3:3 praise the name of our
[1:04:43] Lord John
[1:04:45] 3 and then
[1:04:47] verse he
[1:04:49] says Jesus answered and said unto
[1:04:52] him very very I say unto you
[1:04:57] you except a man be born
[1:05:02] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:05:06] God that's the
[1:05:08] scripture and then when you continue
[1:05:11] reading in verse five Jesus
[1:05:15] answered I say unto
[1:05:18] you except a man be born of
[1:05:22] water and of the spirit he cannot
[1:05:27] enter into the kingdom of
[1:05:30] God now you see so to enter the
[1:05:34] kingom you must be born
[1:05:37] again to see the kingdom you must be
[1:05:40] born again where is it
[1:05:43] given at the
[1:05:47] entrance at the
[1:05:49] beginning it's not given to you at the
[1:05:53] end but given right at the
[1:05:58] because Jesus is the
[1:06:00] door even when they were getting into
[1:06:02] the wedding
[1:06:04] garment they had to be closed at the
[1:06:08] door so even the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:12] Ghost Christ gives it to you at the
[1:06:16] beginning because if you are not with
[1:06:18] the Holy
[1:06:19] Ghost you're not in the
[1:06:21] Kingdom if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:25] you start the
[1:06:26] journey so he gives it at the
[1:06:30] beginning and it is freely
[1:06:33] given by your obedience to the word of
[1:06:37] God praise the name of the Lord now
[1:06:39] still in that same message you must be
[1:06:41] born
[1:06:43] again in paragraph
[1:06:46] 43 he says and
[1:06:49] remember to the first
[1:06:53] thing until you are born
[1:06:57] again you will never
[1:07:01] understand that's brother
[1:07:04] saying twice he spoke
[1:07:08] it except a man be born
[1:07:12] again he cannot enter into the
[1:07:16] king except a man is born
[1:07:20] again he cannot see the
[1:07:22] kingdom now that is pun
[1:07:30] the word in the making all those
[1:07:34] words it says they tell me that they had
[1:07:38] to write it
[1:07:41] out they and when they
[1:07:43] say very
[1:07:46] very that is a
[1:07:50] punctuation like a
[1:07:56] I say you and the word in one
[1:08:00] place or many places it
[1:08:15] islated that this is what you should
[1:08:19] doely
[1:08:20] absolutely I say unto you who said that
[1:08:26] did
[1:08:27] a
[1:08:30] prestor
[1:08:31] evangelist pop God
[1:08:36] himself now there is no
[1:08:39] excuses then he says he will in
[1:08:44] nose no wise at
[1:08:47] all canot in any other
[1:08:51] way no matter how great he
[1:08:54] is what his name
[1:08:56] is how big he is how popular he is he
[1:09:01] cannot even
[1:09:04] understand the kingdom of God
[1:09:08] until he is born
[1:09:10] again it's a great subject very I say
[1:09:14] unto
[1:09:15] you watch go get the Greek
[1:09:22] translation you'll find not to see with
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:27] eyes you see with the heart see you
[1:09:31] can't see the kingdom of
[1:09:34] God with your eyes because it is a
[1:09:38] spiritual
[1:09:39] Kingdom see otherwi you will never be
[1:09:44] able to understand the kingdom of God
[1:09:50] until you are born again it's all UNR
[1:09:58] mystery and when you are born
[1:10:01] again the plans of the
[1:10:04] Kingdom the kingdom
[1:10:06] itself becomes real to
[1:10:10] you that's what is saying he says if you
[1:10:14] are not born
[1:10:16] again brother you're going to St at the
[1:10:18] word of
[1:10:20] God so we need the
[1:10:24] new new
[1:10:26] B is not given to us at the
[1:10:30] end let me bring it the other way the
[1:10:34] new is not the
[1:10:38] climax the
[1:10:41] new is not the
[1:10:44] top but the
[1:10:46] new it's at the
[1:10:49] beginning praise the name of our Lord
[1:10:51] the new
[1:10:53] bus is the door into the kingdom
[1:10:57] now if you not born
[1:10:59] again you are still outside of the
[1:11:02] king and now the the the the thing that
[1:11:06] God requires
[1:11:08] us to enter the
[1:11:11] kingdom hear the word have faith in the
[1:11:16] word the word you enter into the kingom
[1:11:20] then how can you have in your
[1:11:22] mind I've taken 10 years without the
[1:11:24] Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] you've been outside the
[1:11:29] kingdom now God cannot play games of
[1:11:33] hide
[1:11:41] and that's not
[1:11:43] God praise the name
[1:11:46] of
[1:11:49] know praise the name of the Lord the
[1:11:52] condition of the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:54] Ghost
[1:11:56] Obedience of the word nothing more to
[1:11:59] that so the question is are you obedient
[1:12:03] to the word or you're not
[1:12:06] obedient let us go to Acts chapter
[1:12:09] 5 praise the name of our Lord acts
[1:12:14] 5 and then we read in
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:18] verse
[1:12:21] 32 the Bible says and we are his
[1:12:26] Witnesses of these things and so is also
[1:12:29] the Holy Ghost whom God has given to
[1:12:32] them that obey
[1:12:41] him praise the name of the Lord so if
[1:12:44] you don't have the Holy Spirit it means
[1:12:47] you're not
[1:12:49] obedient praise the name of that's the
[1:12:52] thing he says he has given the holy
[1:12:57] to those who obey
[1:13:00] him and any work in
[1:13:04] Salvation it's all about obeying
[1:13:07] God obeying the word of
[1:13:10] God praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:13:13] get another scripture here because the
[1:13:16] Bible
[1:13:17] says a witness of
[1:13:21] 203 let every word be
[1:13:24] established let us go to John chapter
[1:13:28] 14 praise the name of our Lord John
[1:13:31] chapter
[1:13:33] 14 and then we read in verse
[1:13:36] 21 it says he that has my
[1:13:41] Commandments and keepe
[1:13:44] them it is he that love
[1:13:47] me and he that loveth
[1:13:51] me shall be loved of my father
[1:13:55] and I will love
[1:13:58] him I will manifest myself to
[1:14:02] him it's a promise the Holy Spirit
[1:14:07] speaks to the
[1:14:08] word what is your response when you hear
[1:14:12] the word of God he says if you have my
[1:14:16] word and you keep my
[1:14:18] word how do you keep the word of God you
[1:14:22] keep the word of God by obeying that
[1:14:24] word
[1:14:27] that's how you keep it and you
[1:14:31] keep what is precious to
[1:14:34] you praise the name of the Lord you keep
[1:14:38] what is precious to
[1:14:40] you like the banks know how to keep the
[1:14:44] money they have some kind of thing like
[1:14:48] I'm forgetting how they call
[1:14:49] them but they dig underground in some
[1:14:53] places
[1:14:55] and then they get
[1:14:58] SS and to access
[1:15:01] that you may find that in some
[1:15:05] areas the bank manager has the password
[1:15:08] or the
[1:15:11] key even the accountant has another
[1:15:14] person has about three people have to be
[1:15:18] present when they opening the
[1:15:20] self and each person does something for
[1:15:22] it to
[1:15:23] open they Al is
[1:15:26] around they have cameras
[1:15:28] around so you just can't break into
[1:15:32] it they know how to
[1:15:35] keep they keep
[1:15:38] treasure so now even us if we receive
[1:15:42] the word of
[1:15:44] God as a
[1:15:46] treasure praise the name of the Lord you
[1:15:49] keep
[1:15:50] it praise the name of the Lord you keep
[1:15:53] it in your heart
[1:15:55] and when you keep it in your heart you
[1:15:58] are meditating on the word you are
[1:16:01] thinking about the word you are talking
[1:16:04] about the word you are obeying the word
[1:16:07] what does Jesus say it is you that love
[1:16:12] him praise the name of the Lord that
[1:16:15] shows you love
[1:16:17] him like have an illustration here you
[1:16:21] know these days it is
[1:16:23] hot praise
[1:16:25] so you need to drink
[1:16:27] water when I came in I felt I need drink
[1:16:30] more
[1:16:31] water I drun before I
[1:16:34] came but now I'm moving with this bottle
[1:16:36] in
[1:16:38] town everybody said that man wants not
[1:16:42] to
[1:16:44] really I keep
[1:16:46] it because I have the water inside of
[1:16:49] it but the moment the water is
[1:16:53] over I try to look where to put it
[1:16:58] immediately put it because what I need
[1:17:01] is not
[1:17:03] there praise the name of Lord but I keep
[1:17:07] it because there's something I
[1:17:09] need there's something I
[1:17:12] value that is the same thing with the
[1:17:15] word of God you should keep the word of
[1:17:18] God in your
[1:17:20] heart because you value
[1:17:22] it you treasure it
[1:17:25] now Jesus says if you keep the
[1:17:29] word you value the
[1:17:32] word you treasure the
[1:17:34] world that shows you love him now when
[1:17:38] you love him what does he do he says I
[1:17:43] will manifest myself to
[1:17:47] him very
[1:17:50] simple have the word keep the word obey
[1:17:54] the word then he comes and manifest
[1:17:57] himself he reveals himself to
[1:18:00] you praise the name of our Lord then in
[1:18:03] verse 23 he says Jesus answered and said
[1:18:07] unto
[1:18:08] him a man love
[1:18:11] me he will keep my
[1:18:15] words and my father will love
[1:18:19] me he's putting an
[1:18:21] emphas if you say you love God
[1:18:25] you'll keep the word you will cherish
[1:18:28] the word praise the name of our and then
[1:18:31] when you do that he says my father will
[1:18:34] love
[1:18:35] him and he doesn't come doesn't stop
[1:18:38] saying that I love
[1:18:40] him it doesn't stop at that but then he
[1:18:44] says and we will come unto
[1:18:48] him and when they come unto you what do
[1:18:52] they do and make our
[1:18:56] B in him that's the BM of the
[1:19:00] Holy how hard is
[1:19:04] that very
[1:19:06] simple you've heard the
[1:19:09] word cherish the
[1:19:11] word love the word obey the word then
[1:19:15] the Holy Spirit
[1:19:17] himself who has given you that word will
[1:19:21] come into your
[1:19:22] heart where the word is
[1:19:25] that's the BM of the holy spirit it's
[1:19:28] not
[1:19:29] complicated and this happens at the
[1:19:34] beginning it doesn't come at the
[1:19:37] end it comes at the
[1:19:41] beginning praise the name of the Lord so
[1:19:44] the problem
[1:19:46] is why don't you have a
[1:19:50] heart that want receive the whole of God
[1:19:55] praise the name of the Lord now in that
[1:19:57] message you must be born
[1:19:59] again and then
[1:20:01] verse4 paragra 44 says like a
[1:20:06] contractor to build a
[1:20:09] building unless he could read the
[1:20:13] blueprint there's no need of him trying
[1:20:16] to build the
[1:20:20] building now he's putting it to
[1:20:23] theal like the church we
[1:20:26] have if we get a contractor to come and
[1:20:29] build
[1:20:29] it brothers who are Builders
[1:20:32] here we have our brother
[1:20:35] Moses we have brother Andre we have
[1:20:38] brother
[1:20:39] St if you go to them that you want to
[1:20:42] build for them to build for your
[1:20:45] house they will ask you what kind of
[1:20:49] house maybe you give them a
[1:20:51] plan now if you give them a plan
[1:20:55] and they don't know how to interpret the
[1:21:00] plan they're not going to build what you
[1:21:04] want they
[1:21:06] not how are you going to do something
[1:21:08] you don't
[1:21:10] know how so brother bam says if he
[1:21:15] doesn't understand the
[1:21:19] blueprint so he can't
[1:21:22] build and then when he
[1:21:25] understands the
[1:21:26] blueprint then he knows how to build the
[1:21:31] building that is the way it is that's
[1:21:35] what happens about building the kingdom
[1:21:38] of
[1:21:39] God you got to understand the
[1:21:44] blueprint and You Want Build and you
[1:21:47] want know the
[1:21:49] blueprint until you are born
[1:21:52] again and when you are born
[1:21:56] again and then you deny the
[1:22:01] blueprint what takes
[1:22:04] place so then he says he's trying to
[1:22:07] give explanation on the word unless a
[1:22:10] man is born
[1:22:13] again he cannot see the kingdom of and
[1:22:17] to see is to
[1:22:20] understand praise the name of our Lord
[1:22:22] so to understand the kingdom of God
[1:22:26] comes when you have been born
[1:22:28] again praise the name of our so to
[1:22:34] understand comes by the new
[1:22:36] birth and then you'll appreciate the
[1:22:39] things of
[1:22:41] God then you know this is I'm in the
[1:22:43] kingdom of
[1:22:45] God but now if you don't
[1:22:49] see how can you enter the door when you
[1:22:52] can't
[1:22:53] see he says unless you are born
[1:22:56] again you cannot see you cannot
[1:22:59] understand unless you are born again you
[1:23:02] cannot
[1:23:03] enter you don't know the
[1:23:06] door it all comes by the new
[1:23:11] bus praise the name of our Lord so then
[1:23:14] the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:16] Ghost praise the name of our Lord let us
[1:23:19] go to Hebrews chapter
[1:23:22] 6 Hebrews chapter
[1:23:26] 6 and then we read in verse
[1:23:30] one the Bible says therefore living the
[1:23:34] principal doctrine of
[1:23:37] Christ let us go on unto Perfection not
[1:23:41] the laying again the foundation of
[1:23:44] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:23:47] toward God
[1:24:09] now he's saying the principle doctr of
[1:24:18] Christ that's the
[1:24:20] beginning and then which are these
[1:24:22] doctrines of Christ
[1:24:25] which at the
[1:24:27] beginning laying the foundation of
[1:24:32] repentance fa toward
[1:24:37] godse and of the doctrine of
[1:24:44] baptism it says
[1:24:47] baptisms so there is water
[1:24:50] baptism then there is baptism of the
[1:24:52] Holy Spirit
[1:24:54] he says there are the principle
[1:24:58] Doctrine the
[1:25:00] beginnings not the
[1:25:04] end praise the name of Lord they the
[1:25:09] beginnings and if you want to reach
[1:25:11] somewhere you're not going to stay in
[1:25:13] primary
[1:25:15] one praise the name of how will reach
[1:25:19] Senor
[1:25:21] University still in primary
[1:25:25] but you see we are saved at different
[1:25:29] time praise the name of our there are
[1:25:31] those who have gone
[1:25:33] ahead then there are those who are
[1:25:36] beginning who need to be picked
[1:25:39] up to be taught to have faith in
[1:25:43] God to be taught how to
[1:25:46] repent to be taught to forgive one
[1:25:50] another to be taught that the reason
[1:25:53] there is a reason
[1:25:56] to be taught live this kind of
[1:25:58] things to be taught how to be baptized
[1:26:00] in the name of Jesus
[1:26:02] Christ to be taught how to receive the
[1:26:04] Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost praise the name of our be taught
[1:26:09] about the laying on of
[1:26:11] hands that if you are a
[1:26:14] Believer at home and one of you one of
[1:26:18] you is
[1:26:19] sick you can lay hand on your
[1:26:22] brother you can lay hand on your husband
[1:26:25] you can lay on
[1:26:26] your and you
[1:26:28] believe and the scripture is saying
[1:26:33] Beginnings praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:35] so you go forward and then you come back
[1:26:39] you go forward and then you come back
[1:26:42] but to
[1:26:43] grow praise the name of our you need
[1:26:49] meat praise the name of our Lord you
[1:26:52] need to move forward
[1:26:55] praise the name of our Lord now let us
[1:26:57] continue in that same
[1:27:00] area verse two of the doctr of
[1:27:04] baptism and of laying on of
[1:27:07] hands and of resurrection of the
[1:27:10] dead and of Eternal
[1:27:14] judgment and this we will do if God
[1:27:24] praise the name of Lord it's the
[1:27:28] beginning baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:27:31] Christ baptism of the Holy Ghost at the
[1:27:35] beginning praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:38] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:40] you have not entered into
[1:27:44] the you are
[1:27:46] still but how long do you want to be
[1:27:50] outside you say I've been outside one
[1:27:52] year
[1:27:54] why don't you
[1:27:56] enter it has no price
[1:27:59] tag just
[1:28:01] obedience and then you enter praise the
[1:28:05] name of our Lord in Hebrews chapter
[1:28:07] 5 the scripture
[1:28:12] says verse
[1:28:14] 11 of whom we have many things to say
[1:28:17] and had to be uttered seeing you are D
[1:28:20] of hearing
[1:28:35] but when the time you ought to be
[1:28:38] teachers you have need that one teaches
[1:28:41] you again which be the first principles
[1:28:44] of the Oracles of God and have become
[1:28:47] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:28:50] strong meat
[1:29:13] for everyone that uses milk is UNSC in
[1:29:17] the word of righteousness for he is a
[1:29:19] baby
[1:29:31] then Hees to say but strong meat belongs
[1:29:34] to them that are of full age even those
[1:29:37] who are by reason of Youth have their
[1:29:39] senses exercise to discern both Good and
[1:29:43] Evil
[1:30:05] praise the name of Lord he says the
[1:30:09] principles you know the
[1:30:13] beginnings for
[1:30:15] babies praise the name of the Lord but
[1:30:18] if we are grow if we are to mature
[1:30:21] up we need the meat
[1:30:24] praise the name of our Lord going
[1:30:29] higher praise the name of our Lord but
[1:30:32] you see all the stages of our Christian
[1:30:38] walk our
[1:30:41] conviction it is the Holy Ghost who
[1:30:43] does our
[1:30:46] justification the Holy Ghost does that
[1:30:49] our
[1:30:50] sanctification is the Holy Ghost our
[1:30:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:30:57] then there you've entered the
[1:30:58] kingdom but even to grow in the
[1:31:02] kingdom it is the holy
[1:31:05] spirit he teaches you he guides you he
[1:31:11] you he takes you into different
[1:31:16] trials our Lord Jesus Christ could not
[1:31:19] go into the
[1:31:21] trial without the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:25] and the Bible says when he was filled
[1:31:27] with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost took
[1:31:29] him to the
[1:31:31] Wilderness to bet tried of
[1:31:34] Satan praise the name of the Lord so
[1:31:37] they come when you are born
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:40] again praise the name of they come here
[1:31:43] when you are born
[1:31:45] again and it's the spirit of God that
[1:31:49] gives you the ability to overcome the
[1:31:52] trials
[1:31:54] The
[1:31:55] Temptations you don't overcome them by
[1:31:58] yourself it is the spirit of
[1:32:01] God that has convicted you and then you
[1:32:05] accepted the Lord Jesus as your
[1:32:08] person and then the spirit justifies you
[1:32:12] the spirit sanctifies and the spirit
[1:32:14] fills you so every day you
[1:32:18] walk it has to be the spirit
[1:32:21] of praise the name of our now in the
[1:32:24] message questions and answer of
[1:32:29] 1954 he says there is only one scripture
[1:32:32] in the entire
[1:32:35] Bible that people was
[1:32:39] reaped and that was those who was
[1:32:41] baptized by John the
[1:32:44] Baptist before the Holy Ghost
[1:32:47] came in Acts 19
[1:32:52] verse5 told them that heart be
[1:32:54] rebaptised
[1:32:58] again in the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:33:03] order to receive the Holy
[1:33:05] Ghost he's not putting it at the end
[1:33:08] he's putting it right at the
[1:33:10] beginning then he says now you don't
[1:33:14] have to be
[1:33:15] baptized to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:33:19] because you can receive the Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost when your heart is right
[1:33:26] not difficult he says to receive the
[1:33:29] Holy Ghost your heart has to be right so
[1:33:33] the question is praise the name of if
[1:33:36] you say you have not received the Holy
[1:33:39] Ghost 10 years I've been looking for the
[1:33:43] holy what's wrong with
[1:33:45] you why don't you have a
[1:33:49] right praise the name of the Lord so you
[1:33:52] see it is a misunder
[1:33:57] it's a misunderstood
[1:34:01] way of how the Holy Ghost comes in our
[1:34:05] Liv and you say I accept the Lord Jesus
[1:34:07] as my personal
[1:34:09] Savior and I've obeyed everything God
[1:34:11] wants me
[1:34:12] to and God has never given me the Holy
[1:34:16] Ghost that's a false
[1:34:19] witness because the Bible says here
[1:34:22] repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:34:26] receive and brother Bram says as long as
[1:34:30] your heart is
[1:34:32] Right you've obeyed the word of God then
[1:34:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:36] comes then he
[1:34:40] says because in Acts chapter 2 Peter
[1:34:44] give a
[1:34:46] formula to repent and be baptized in the
[1:34:50] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:34:53] receive receive the gift of the Holy
[1:34:56] Ghost but in Acts 10 ver
[1:35:01] 49 God turned
[1:35:03] around and gave the
[1:35:07] Gentiles the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] before they was ever baptized at
[1:35:13] all you see so you see it is the
[1:35:17] condition of your
[1:35:20] heart what is the condition of your
[1:35:22] heart
[1:35:24] now our walk with
[1:35:26] Christ should be so
[1:35:30] personal so
[1:35:32] personal that you love him with all your
[1:35:36] hearts all your
[1:35:38] mind praise the name of our and that's
[1:35:41] how the Holy
[1:35:43] Spirit Works in our
[1:35:47] lives praise the name of our Lord now in
[1:35:50] the message the Queen of Sheba
[1:35:55] and so she took
[1:35:57] off and here is something else that had
[1:36:00] to confront
[1:36:03] her the children of
[1:36:06] isma was on the
[1:36:08] desert Fleet footed
[1:36:12] Riders
[1:36:14] robbers
[1:36:16] murderers what a pray that would be for
[1:36:20] them why that great band of
[1:36:26] men could ride in on that little
[1:36:31] company and mop it out in a few moments
[1:36:35] time and look at the thousands of
[1:36:38] dollars of
[1:36:40] money and well she had on those
[1:36:44] camels why was it set up for
[1:36:48] them but you know what her faith and
[1:36:54] desire to see the kingdom of
[1:36:57] God God stopped it for
[1:37:01] her he made a way for
[1:37:03] her and I said to
[1:37:06] you both visible and invisible
[1:37:10] audience if your heart is so
[1:37:14] hungry and
[1:37:16] thirsting to come to God God will make a
[1:37:21] way for you
[1:37:23] to get to him he always did it and he
[1:37:27] will
[1:37:29] always praise the name of that's all you
[1:37:32] need you heard the word said Lord I need
[1:37:36] more of
[1:37:37] you transform me prise the name of our
[1:37:42] that's what you need when you hear the
[1:37:44] word tring at the
[1:37:48] word you know you desire more of God in
[1:37:50] your life
[1:37:53] Holy Spirit comes and takes over your
[1:37:56] life he fills your life and he takes
[1:38:00] leadership of your
[1:38:02] life like this woman the Queen of
[1:38:06] Sheba you know she had to give
[1:38:11] all and God made a way for
[1:38:14] her praise the name of our Lord and
[1:38:16] that's the same thing that we
[1:38:19] need praise the name of our Lord is when
[1:38:22] you hear the
[1:38:24] word obey the word of God surrender
[1:38:27] yourself to the word
[1:38:29] of and now when the Lord himself comes
[1:38:32] by in Your Heart by the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit now I'm not saying that should be
[1:38:38] at the
[1:38:40] end praise the name of at the
[1:38:44] beginning praise the name of Lord it
[1:38:47] comes at the
[1:38:48] beginning not at the
[1:38:51] end praise the name of of Lord so he
[1:38:54] starts with
[1:38:56] you and allow him to work upon your
[1:39:00] life to bring you into the image of
[1:39:02] Jesus
[1:39:03] Christ praise the name of our so we need
[1:39:07] allow
[1:39:09] God that he can work in our
[1:39:12] lives to bring us into the image of
[1:39:15] Jesus
[1:39:16] Christ praise the name of the Lord let
[1:39:18] us go back to Romans chapter
[1:39:20] 6 and then verse four
[1:39:23] he says therefore we are buried with him
[1:39:26] by baptism into death that like as
[1:39:29] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:39:31] the glory of the father even so we also
[1:39:34] should walk in the newness of
[1:39:51] Life praise the name of our Lord
[1:39:54] he says we should walk in the newness of
[1:39:58] life so then how do we walk in the
[1:40:00] newness of
[1:40:02] life and now this new life is the life
[1:40:07] of Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ another words the life is in you
[1:40:12] the Life of Christ Is In
[1:40:14] You by the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:18] Ghost without the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:21] Ghost you cannot be the newness of life
[1:40:25] so it has to be the spirit of God coming
[1:40:29] down in your heart and when the spirit
[1:40:32] of God is in your
[1:40:34] life then you are in a new
[1:40:37] life you have been born
[1:40:40] again you are a new
[1:40:43] creation we are not looking at becoming
[1:40:45] the new
[1:40:47] creation at the end but we are telling
[1:40:51] you become a new creation
[1:40:54] right at the
[1:40:55] beginning praise the name of our Lord
[1:40:58] not at the end but at the
[1:41:01] beginning praise the name of our Lord
[1:41:03] and so when you are
[1:41:05] new when you have been
[1:41:08] created praise the name of the then you
[1:41:11] live by the spirit
[1:41:13] of you walk by the spirit of you are no
[1:41:17] longer yourself but it is Christ that is
[1:41:20] in
[1:41:21] you that lives his life
[1:41:24] praise the name of God is not asking you
[1:41:28] first do this then I'll do this no
[1:41:33] salvation is all of the
[1:41:36] lord it's all the working of

[1:41:59] Lord in the message revelation of Jesus
[1:42:02] Christ brother says he has made
[1:42:07] us oh there are certain
[1:42:11] truths we need to

[1:42:25] myself you'll fail along the
[1:42:28] way but allow him to take over your life
[1:42:32] from the very beginning when you accept
[1:42:35] him as your personal savior that's the
[1:42:37] time you say Lord here I am take over my

[1:43:09] up allow him to adopt

[1:44:46] place why is ever
[1:44:49] present to help you in the challenges
[1:44:54] that come in
[1:44:55] life then in the Philadelphian Church
[1:44:58] age says but the Jews back there in the
[1:45:02] time of
[1:45:04] Jesus did not want to accept that
[1:45:08] sacrifice the blood of bulls and
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:21] goats made nothing
[1:45:24] it was once God's ordained
[1:45:28] method but now Christ having appeared in
[1:45:33] the
[1:45:35] flesh and by the shedding of his
[1:45:39] blood has put away
[1:45:42] sin and by that offering of
[1:45:46] himself has made us
[1:45:49] perfect praise the name of our Lord then
[1:45:51] he says the Jews would not take
[1:45:54] that but not about the Philadelphian
[1:45:58] age and yes the other ages to did they
[1:46:02] really accept this reality in
[1:46:06] Christ no sir even though R brought the
[1:46:10] truth of
[1:46:13] justification the Rish
[1:46:15] church and it stand counter at the
[1:46:18] Orthodox
[1:46:20] Church still cl to work
[1:46:25] now works are
[1:46:28] fine but they cannot save
[1:46:31] you they don't make you
[1:46:34] perfect it is
[1:46:36] Christ
[1:46:38] perish and it's not even
[1:46:42] Christ and
[1:46:44] works in other words you don't say I
[1:46:47] have
[1:46:48] Christ and now let me add
[1:46:51] Works only
[1:46:56] it is Christ
[1:46:58] Alone this age begin began the years of
[1:47:05] arminianism
[1:47:07] Amis that does not believe in Christ as
[1:47:09] the
[1:47:11] reality it does not sing of nothing but
[1:47:14] the
[1:47:16] blood but it SS of nothing but the blood
[1:47:19] and my own conduct
[1:47:24] now I believe in Good
[1:47:26] Conduct if you are saved you do
[1:47:30] righteously we have already gone over
[1:47:33] that but let me tell you now salvation
[1:47:37] is not Jesus
[1:47:40] plus it is Jesus alone salvation is of
[1:47:45] the
[1:47:46] Lord from the
[1:47:48] start to the Finish it's all God
[1:47:53] let his life be in
[1:47:56] me let it be his blood that
[1:47:59] cleanses let his spirit that fills
[1:48:02] me let it be his word in my
[1:48:06] heart and my mouth let it be his stripes
[1:48:09] that heal
[1:48:11] me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not
[1:48:16] by works of
[1:48:18] righteousness that I have done no sir
[1:48:23] is my life praise the name of our that's
[1:48:27] how we need to see that we
[1:48:30] walk in the newness of life you're not
[1:48:34] working in the newness of
[1:48:36] Life by your
[1:48:38] ability you'll fail on your

[1:49:08] you up to the
[1:49:10] destination praise the name of our let
[1:49:12] us go to Ephesians chapter
[1:49:15] 2 and then verse
[1:49:19] one walking in the newness of life
[1:49:24] you can never walk in the
[1:49:26] new by your own self it has to be the
[1:49:30] spirit of
[1:49:32] God who comes when you're starting the
[1:49:35] journey to guide you all the
[1:49:38] way praise the name of like it was
[1:49:42] interesting when they were singing that
[1:49:44] song I am
[1:49:46] sealed the
[1:49:48] SE happens at the beginning
[1:49:52] these
[1:49:54] containers before they are
[1:49:58] destined they put a
[1:50:01] SE the same thing with
[1:50:03] God a seal on

[1:50:39] beginning you to fill you with the Holy
[1:50:42] Ghost to reach your
[1:50:45] destination praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:47] so then he says in Ephesians 2

[1:50:54] quickened you know that
[1:50:57] quickening he makes you
[1:51:01] alive dead in
[1:51:04] trespasses and sins so when you had the
[1:51:09] gospel and then the Holy Ghost convicted
[1:51:12] you you repented of your sins you
[1:51:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:51:18] you receive the you know the Forgiveness
[1:51:20] of sins

[1:51:33] you don't like the other you don't like
[1:51:35] the other it's the same Holy
[1:51:38] Spirit and then the same Holy Spirit
[1:51:42] fills you with the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:44] Ghost and when he FS with the baptism of
[1:51:47] the Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost then the life of Jesus Christ
[1:51:52] becomes ested in your
[1:51:54] life praise the name of the Lord where

[1:52:25] your
[1:52:26] life when you didn't have the new
[1:52:30] life you walked by your

[1:53:31] life is
[1:53:33] different there is something
[1:53:36] different praise the name of our Lord
[1:53:38] now let me just read this
[1:53:40] message he says in the message the Queen
[1:53:43] of
[1:53:44] Sheba he
[1:53:45] says if it is the
[1:53:48] truth I want it then power in every

[1:54:30] are so you become so
[1:54:35] salty until the people of your
[1:54:39] community will say if there ever was a
[1:54:44] change it is in that person
[1:54:48] there there you
[1:54:50] are if I'm ever a
[1:54:54] Christian I want to be like that man or
[1:54:57] that
[1:54:59] woman they have
[1:55:01] love they have joy peace long
[1:55:06] suffering goodness gentleness patience
[1:55:11] weakness and so forth the nine fruits of
[1:55:15] the
[1:55:16] spirit dwells within them they are not
[1:55:20] easily provoked
[1:55:23] you can't make them you can't make them
[1:55:26] mad at
[1:55:28] you they will not become
[1:55:31] hungry they are so
[1:55:34] loving that in their very
[1:55:37] presence you feel Christ there you are
[1:55:41] there you are that's what the church
[1:55:44] needs not because you can argue about
[1:55:47] your relig
[1:55:50] standpoint that doesn't
[1:55:52] minute it's your life that proves what
[1:55:57] you are that's what proved what God when
[1:56:00] came
[1:56:01] down it was his grace that Prov that
[1:56:05] he's the god of
[1:56:07] Grace this the children of Israel praise
[1:56:11] the name of our Lord so there is a
[1:56:12] change in our
[1:56:14] lives when the Holy Ghost comes he lives
[1:56:18] his own life and that's the newness of
[1:56:21] life

[1:56:24] in How
[1:56:27] often
[1:56:29] daily praise the name of the Lord our
[1:56:32] walk in the newness of

[1:56:38] stop at home doesn't stop where people
[1:56:41] know
[1:56:42] you but it's a life that you
[1:56:45] live and that newness of
[1:56:47] life you live it unconsciously

[1:56:58] Psychology they teach people how to
[1:57:00] behave

[1:57:29] complaining when he finishes
[1:57:32] you that is
[1:57:35] psychology that's not
[1:57:38] Christianity the is a life that is

[1:57:48] about I'm going to meet hard people
[1:57:52] what am I going to

[1:57:57] way no that's not
[1:58:01] Christianity in the world they teach how
[1:58:03] to
[1:58:05] behave but still those things can be
[1:58:07] proved that it is
[1:58:10] fake praise the name of but this is a
[1:58:13] life that comes from
[1:58:16] within like brother gives an
[1:58:18] illustration of the ship
[1:58:30] it will
[1:58:31] grow because the life is
[1:58:34] inside it will come and
[1:58:37] Grow

[1:58:43] out the oil comes from
[1:58:46] inside the oil comes from
[1:58:49] inside and then comes on the skin
[1:58:53] and then it keeps it

[1:59:23] change that
[1:59:25] happens when the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:59:28] let us go back to Ephesians chapter

[2:00:15] love with loved us even as we were dead
[2:00:18] in sins has quickened us together to sit
[2:00:22] in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:00:40] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[2:00:42] show the exceeding Riches of his grace
[2:00:45] in his kindness toward us through

[2:40:30] Inu you wear very short
[2:40:33] ones you in laws you're just still Bound
[2:40:36] by the
[2:40:38] law you know but we need to leave
