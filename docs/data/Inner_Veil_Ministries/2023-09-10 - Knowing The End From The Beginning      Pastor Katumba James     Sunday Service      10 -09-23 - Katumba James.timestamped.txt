[27:18] I think she's not around
[27:21] praise the name of our Lord
[27:25] our pastor is not around today
[27:28] he went for missionary work
[27:32] on Wednesday was able to reach safely
[27:34] with his wife
[27:39] Canada safely when I think Thursday
[27:41] evening or Friday morning
[27:44] so just keep him in your prayers and
[27:48] they will be taking their some Services
[27:51] I know my real services are in the night
[27:54] our time here
[27:59] and so you can follow up the ministry
[28:01] there also
[28:03] just keep him in your prayers
[28:09] and then next Sunday
[28:11] we are going to have a youth meeting in
[28:13] the afternoon
[28:15] so I'd request all they used to be
[28:17] around for the afternoon service on
[28:19] Sunday
[28:27] so today
[28:30] I just want us to see some of the
[28:33] missions we have been doing then
[28:36] we just displayed on the video we're
[28:39] going to start but after dedication of
[28:40] the baby to a dog which is
[28:43] and then today was also you know this
[28:46] week I was praying what should I
[28:47] preached it today
[28:50] and then there's a thought that came I
[28:53] was trying to prepare on on Friday
[28:56] and then again another thought which had
[28:59] to come by those India and when I
[29:01] started preparing about this other
[29:03] thought we are going to share today
[29:05] and I find everything is driving in a
[29:09] direction
[29:11] praise the name of Allah so we shall be
[29:15] take of it time to adapt you know on
[29:19] what we are doing which is What the Lord
[29:22] Has Done in our day
[29:24] What the Lord Has Done in our age
[29:29] and my desire
[29:31] that each and every one of us
[29:36] you put it as a burden upon your heart
[29:40] to go and even tell your friends
[29:43] you go and tell your colleagues
[29:46] tell your family
[29:48] praise the name of our Lord like I can
[29:51] give a testimony brother if you want to
[29:54] stand up brother
[29:56] you can sit down he's also a student at
[30:00] the Kampala International University is
[30:02] doing internships
[30:10] so he's doing internship here in the
[30:13] ginger
[30:14] he received the message I think one or
[30:16] less about a year ago
[30:19] and so this week you had gone to his
[30:22] place his village
[30:25] and then he met his sister and the
[30:28] sister is a pastor of a Pentecostal
[30:30] church after chidera before you reachung
[30:33] all right
[30:36] immediately
[31:04] so he came here on Thursday
[31:07] you know trying to look around for how
[31:10] it can be handled negotiations then we
[31:13] finally talked in the evening because I
[31:14] was a
[31:15] and then now he said my sister wants to
[31:19] be baptized
[31:21] then I was asking him from where now we
[31:24] can baptize the baptized at church but
[31:27] then I said what about the church I said
[31:30] she's also willing to get the same
[31:31] message to go to his her child
[31:34] where is the name of Allah so on Tuesday
[31:38] God willing he shall be going to that
[31:41] place beyond kidera
[31:42] to preach to them the message
[31:48] so that's how the gospel is going
[31:52] praise the name of Allah on Wednesday
[31:55] there is you remember when we had
[31:58] brother Andreas here located there is a
[32:01] when they called pastors
[32:04] there was a woman who came as a pastor
[32:06] and she stood in Frontier
[32:09] she's a pastor in a church
[32:12] she has also invited us that bring this
[32:14] same message to our church
[32:19] so on Wednesday
[32:21] we shall be at her place
[32:24] because the church will be open
[32:27] at 4 30 for the afternoon service
[32:35] then on Thursdays
[32:40] you know we've been having some of these
[32:42] meetings with the new pastors to the
[32:44] different churches
[32:47] but we had never preached them on issues
[32:50] of marriage
[32:51] so last Thursday I started preaching on
[32:54] marriage series
[32:57] after the whole of this month we shall
[32:59] be taking almost five Services
[33:05] those pastors
[33:08] then on Friday and a Saturday
[33:13] there is also a church which is coming
[33:15] out from Pentecost
[33:17] we have ever been there once but we've
[33:21] been inviting the pastor from other
[33:23] different meetings
[33:25] the pastor called me he has prepared two
[33:29] two days meetings
[33:30] it is actually in the Royal District
[33:36] he also says come preach and also
[33:39] baptize my
[33:50] so now this day God being gracious
[33:53] we want to see what the Lord Has Done In
[33:57] Our Generation
[33:59] and then we we have also this references
[34:03] like our church website
[34:06] it has What the Lord Has Done the summer
[34:09] of it
[34:11] you can share with your friends
[34:15] you know and then you tell them you see
[34:17] God has done this and all these things
[34:19] are of proof
[34:21] say that each and every one of us we can
[34:25] encourage this message to the next
[34:26] person
[34:32] to your colleagues and so on praise the
[34:36] name of Allah so before we go further
[34:40] there is a it says God bless you
[34:44] then he says God has multiplied my
[34:46] family with a bouncing baby boy Solomon
[34:49] cartoon
[34:52] [Music]
[34:53] I request the boy to be dedicated to God
[34:58] this is from Brother Richard Montgomery
[35:01] you can sing bring them in as they bring
[35:04] the baby
[35:08] bring them in
[35:12] bring them
[35:22] [Music]
[35:25] bring them in
[35:29] bring them in
[35:33] bring once
[35:39] come
[35:41] bring them in
[35:46] bring
[35:51] them in from the fields
[35:56] [Applause]
[35:56] [Music]
[36:06] bring down wonders
[36:10] [Music]
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:13] [Music]
[36:29] [Music]
[36:36] bring down
[36:39] [Music]
[36:47] amen praise the name of our Lord you
[36:51] know in the denominations
[36:53] they baptized little children like this
[36:56] little baby before us
[36:59] but that one is not right are you
[37:02] educated that's not in the scriptures
[37:07] you know before somebody is baptized
[37:12] or even baptism which they do
[37:15] it's not the baptism because they get
[37:18] the little baby
[37:20] sprinkle water in the foreign
[37:35] [Music]
[37:45] by putting them right beneath the Earth
[37:50] so even baptism somebody must be
[37:53] immersed in the world
[37:55] that's right here we have a pool
[38:00] and then we immerse the people who come
[38:03] to be baptized
[38:04] so if there is somebody here who has
[38:08] never been baptized in the name of Jesus
[38:10] Christ by imagine
[38:13] you need to do that before it is too
[38:16] late
[38:18] so now
[38:20] the denominations bring children and
[38:22] said they are baptizing them which is
[38:24] not right
[38:26] but even before you are baptized
[38:29] according to the scriptures
[38:32] the Bible says he that believes
[38:37] [Music]
[38:38] shall be saved so before somebody is
[38:42] baptized
[38:43] they must first believe I know and then
[38:48] the Bible says how shall they believe if
[38:52] they are not preached to
[38:53] so now when you hear the gospel and then
[38:57] the Bible says that's in Romans
[39:04] and the confesses with the mouse
[39:08] so you must hear a preacher you must
[39:11] hear the word when you hear the word of
[39:14] God you believe that word with yourself
[39:39] [Music]
[39:49] [Music]
[40:18] so when we were foreign
[40:38] unto him little children
[40:41] that he should put his hands on them
[40:44] ecology and pray a servant and the
[40:48] disciples rebuked them
[40:50] but Jesus said foreign
[41:31] amen
[41:51] [Music]
[41:57] [Music]
[42:09] [Music]
[42:48] where the Bible says people will be
[42:51] disobedient
[42:55] and so many wickedness
[42:58] we pray for your protection
[43:04] we pray heaven we may give grace to the
[43:08] father
[43:12] may you give him wisdom
[43:15] your blessings and protection
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] be such a positive example to this baby
[43:28] when it comes
[43:32] Lord we pray he may give his life unto
[43:35] the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:43] give this baby good health every need
[43:47] that they have needed
[43:49] [Music]
[43:57] [Music]
[44:03] God bless you
[44:07] [Music]
[44:15] so I think we can go to the missionary
[44:18] kind of activities we are doing
[44:21] this
[44:23] praise the name of our Lord I think we
[44:26] start with the
[44:27] okay maybe if you can start with one by
[44:29] one as you put them there and then I can
[44:32] give some small
[44:33] background on each
[44:44] now that's what a baptism
[44:49] like during that time we baptized the
[44:52] six to eight people these are different
[44:55] places actually Robert is
[45:00] some of these places
[45:03] some of them are in ibali like that one
[45:05] is in calero which is on right now
[45:12] and then what about the volume if you
[45:15] can increase the volume
[45:30] normally after baptism we give them
[45:32] Bibles Uganda Bibles
[45:38] that was also in number those were about
[45:41] I think 80 people were baptizing
[46:07] [Applause]

[1:03:43] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:46] amen let us go to Isaiah chapter 46.
[1:03:53] Isaiah chapter 46.
[1:03:56] we're reading verse 9 and verse 10 Our
[1:04:00] Community
[1:04:02] Praise the name of Allah
[1:04:05] so the Bible says
[1:04:08] remember the former things of old for I
[1:04:12] am God and there is none else I am God
[1:04:15] and there is none like me
[1:04:18] um
[1:04:25] declaring the end from the beginning and
[1:04:28] from the ancient times the things that
[1:04:30] are not yet done saying my cancer shall
[1:04:34] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[1:04:37] foreign
[1:04:50] the greatest thing of his word you may
[1:04:53] be seated praise the name of our Lord so
[1:04:56] I want to preach on knowing the end from
[1:04:58] the beginning
[1:05:02] knowing the end
[1:05:04] from the beginning now in verse 10. he
[1:05:10] says declaring the end from the
[1:05:13] beginning
[1:05:15] and from the ancient times the things
[1:05:18] that are not yet done
[1:05:22] saying my cancer
[1:05:24] shall stand and I will do my pleasure
[1:05:30] now to declare
[1:05:34] means that you are announcing
[1:05:38] you are publishing
[1:05:41] you are proclaiming
[1:05:44] but now how the Lord declares
[1:05:48] he declares something
[1:05:51] as if it has been done foreign
[1:07:49] of God foreign
[1:08:50] foreign
[1:09:02] and to us
[1:09:04] dear today
[1:09:07] a child is born um now you can start
[1:09:10] asking where is that child because the
[1:09:12] child has been born to us
[1:09:14] but this is Isaiah speaking about 600
[1:09:18] years
[1:09:21] before it happened but for him we saw
[1:09:24] the reality
[1:09:29] a son is giving um then he says his
[1:09:32] government shall be on his shoulders
[1:09:39] the Everlasting father the prince of
[1:09:42] peace
[1:09:47] and then they get into the mind of God
[1:09:50] and when the prophets get into the mind
[1:09:54] they see the things that God
[1:09:57] as real as it is happening
[1:10:02] so God knows the end from the beginning
[1:10:08] like Moses
[1:10:11] praise the name of our Lord Moses writes
[1:10:13] the book of Genesis
[1:10:15] and then when he writes the book of
[1:10:18] Genesis he says in the beginning
[1:10:20] God created the heavens and the others
[1:10:23] then you ask Moses where where are you
[1:11:18] foreign foreign
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:13:30] up to the time
[1:13:41] foreign Moses writing the Book of
[1:13:45] Genesis how did he write it God was
[1:13:49] revealing it to him
[1:13:51] praise the name of Allah and then Moses
[1:13:54] in his lifetime God showed him the
[1:13:59] coming of Christ
[1:14:03] the name of Allah so now you have the
[1:14:07] confidence
[1:14:09] that what I have believed
[1:14:12] is the truth
[1:14:14] praise the name of Allah you have
[1:14:16] confidence that I know where I am going
[1:14:20] to the angel praise the name of our Lord
[1:14:22] it is a clear path
[1:14:25] it says
[1:14:29] in this same message God was showing
[1:14:33] brother
[1:14:34] the things
[1:14:38] he was showing him the things
[1:14:41] and when he comes and brings them out he
[1:14:45] speaks with the certainty
[1:14:48] that it is
[1:14:53] going to be
[1:14:55] now I want us to go to the church
[1:14:57] website
[1:15:00] praise the name of our Lord
[1:15:02] our church website you can get it
[1:15:06] www.ww dot
[1:15:10] innervailministries.org
[1:15:12] all these things will put them on the
[1:15:14] Internet
[1:15:14] make good news of them because
[1:15:18] praise the name of Allah
[1:15:21] now like here we we wrote about the
[1:15:23] timelines of brother Branham
[1:15:27] I think we can go to
[1:15:31] we can go to
[1:15:34] night number three
[1:15:38] praise the name of our Lord you can get
[1:15:41] that information there you can share it
[1:15:44] with your friends
[1:15:46] know what the Lord Has Done in our age
[1:15:51] God has sent us a prophet like now
[1:15:56] let us go back to your place where I've
[1:15:58] been
[1:16:00] you know in 1906 1916.
[1:16:04] in 1916 ready to be clear
[1:16:08] in 1916. you know he was still a little
[1:16:12] boy because he was born in 1909
[1:16:17] and then now
[1:16:19] so when it was about seven years I would
[1:16:22] say oh so yeah
[1:16:26] he was actually going to fetch water
[1:16:30] I pray you keep it the way I would wish
[1:16:32] it to keep it
[1:16:34] so now
[1:16:37] he was speaking water yeah
[1:16:47] I think now for us we don't call it
[1:16:49] Imperial kazim
[1:16:51] praise the name of Allah
[1:16:53] you know Uganda that's what we know
[1:17:05] so that that kind of well-oing
[1:17:11] he had it like in the tree
[1:17:15] and then he had the voice and the voice
[1:17:19] told him from a tree do not drink
[1:17:25] or smoke
[1:17:27] but defile yourself in any way there
[1:17:31] will be work for you to do when you get
[1:17:33] older
[1:17:37] so when he had that voice he ran to his
[1:17:40] mother
[1:17:42] I've heard the man talk to me from the
[1:17:44] tree then the mother said now this one
[1:17:47] may be navias just calmed him down
[1:17:52] as he grew up as a youth several times
[1:17:56] he wanted to do what other used to do
[1:17:59] because you are maybe in a company maybe
[1:18:02] they are smoking so he would want to
[1:18:04] smoke there was a time where a friend
[1:18:07] was teasing him you don't like going to
[1:18:10] discourse
[1:18:12] you don't like to drink
[1:18:14] get this cigarette and put on your mouth
[1:18:19] don't be a cease
[1:18:23] and then he was putting it here then in
[1:18:26] that same sound of the wild wind Camp
[1:18:31] he threw down the cigarettes
[1:18:35] then another time because his father was
[1:18:39] distilling alcohol
[1:18:43] so the father had the friends and they
[1:18:45] were drinking
[1:18:46] of All My Children
[1:18:54] said you give him a bottle
[1:18:56] so when they were giving him a bottle
[1:18:59] again that kind of sound then he took
[1:19:02] off
[1:19:05] praise the name of it and you see when
[1:19:08] he was born in 1909.
[1:19:13] during his back there was a pillar of
[1:19:16] fire that came where he was
[1:19:20] in the morning when he was born morning
[1:19:22] around 5 a.m
[1:19:24] and the light stayed there
[1:19:29] and a number of times in his life
[1:19:32] when he would he was not yet a Believer
[1:19:36] when he goes to a place then these
[1:19:39] people who are astrologers
[1:19:42] they would say there is a star moving
[1:19:45] over your head
[1:19:47] then he says what about the other
[1:19:51] persons
[1:19:54] can I tell you you they tell me you were
[1:19:56] born and then the person would tell him
[1:19:59] you were born on this day at this time
[1:20:02] say tell also the others
[1:20:06] then again in Another Place Another will
[1:20:10] tell him you know you have a gift of God
[1:20:14] say they don't understand I don't
[1:20:16] understand
[1:20:17] then they said you you don't read the
[1:20:19] Bible cancel my Bible the three wise men
[1:20:22] they were following yesterday
[1:20:25] so for him we wouldn't understand
[1:20:29] so now let us go number four
[1:20:35] so in 19016 in 1916
[1:20:39] he had the first Vision
[1:20:43] now in this vision
[1:20:47] he saw a bridge being built over River
[1:20:50] Ohio
[1:20:52] and 16 people fell in the river and died
[1:20:57] now this was fulfilled exactly 22 years
[1:21:01] from that year you know
[1:21:05] when the Second Street bridge in
[1:21:07] Louisville Kentucky was built on River
[1:21:09] Ohio in which 16 people died
[1:21:17] and then in 1923
[1:21:20] number five
[1:21:24] he saw the vision of hair yeah
[1:21:31] so he says while hunting one evening
[1:21:34] he was accidentally shot on both legs
[1:21:37] and taken to hospital in a critical
[1:21:39] condition
[1:21:41] he was in hospital for a long time but
[1:21:45] now he was getting in a place of death
[1:21:47] and then he got into a vision of him he
[1:21:51] saw himself descending down in here
[1:21:57] and there was Darkness
[1:22:00] it was a bottomless feet
[1:22:02] a lot of dreads and then he was crying
[1:22:11] then he said oh God
[1:22:16] and when he promised to go there to come
[1:22:19] and become a good boy
[1:22:23] he later on came back to Consciousness
[1:22:27] and then he took time being treated
[1:22:29] until he recovered
[1:22:32] then the next one
[1:22:40] so he started this ministry in 1932.
[1:22:44] after he had got saved there are so many
[1:22:47] things to talk about
[1:22:48] but I would interest you I know yes to
[1:22:52] read the life story of Brothers
[1:22:56] praise the name of our Lord now let us
[1:22:59] go to 1960 19.
[1:23:02] 33 that's number seven
[1:23:09] so in 19
[1:23:13] Ethiopia
[1:24:09] and then you tell them do you know that
[1:24:12] even the second world war God has talked
[1:24:15] about it before it happens
[1:24:19] and when brother Branham was seeing this
[1:24:21] God would show him the name
[1:24:31] he conquered the country when he went
[1:24:34] back to Italy they threw him out
[1:24:38] it got fulfilled
[1:24:41] praise the name of Allah and then now
[1:24:44] the second world war
[1:24:46] what happened he said he saw he said the
[1:24:49] younger Australian called Hitler yeah
[1:24:54] and then he brought the whole world to
[1:24:56] you know into the second world war
[1:24:59] and second world was set in 1939 to 1945
[1:25:03] but these things God had shown brother
[1:25:07] this is a major world events
[1:25:13] history
[1:25:17] now God was showing them to brother
[1:25:19] brother before they would happen
[1:25:39] you know all of them being communism
[1:25:42] kind of becoming the dominant one um
[1:25:45] then the fourth Vision
[1:25:48] he showed advances in technology
[1:25:53] until they developed a kind of a car
[1:25:57] which is like an egg
[1:25:59] now at that time technology was so long
[1:26:05] but right now they are developing cars
[1:26:08] in those developed countries
[1:26:11] and those cars don't you may not need
[1:26:14] the steering
[1:26:16] nowadays in America in America they have
[1:26:19] developed that car where you just sit
[1:26:20] and he moves
[1:26:27] so when it reaches a junction
[1:26:30] it stops
[1:26:33] when there is a kind in front of it it
[1:26:36] stops if there is a car coming to knock
[1:26:38] it okay it is
[1:26:48] praise the name of our Lord he saw
[1:26:51] things that are to be yeah you can tell
[1:26:54] people all these things that are
[1:26:57] happening now
[1:26:58] God revealed them to the prophet of this
[1:27:02] you can interest them in the message now
[1:27:05] if God would reveal them to these things
[1:27:08] how about the things
[1:27:19] you know he saw how women would become
[1:27:24] undressed
[1:27:27] now it is almost everywhere
[1:27:30] in those developed countries people
[1:27:33] don't want to put on dresses
[1:27:36] they don't care how they are moving then
[1:27:40] in some countries they have a day where
[1:27:41] people move naked without a pant without
[1:27:44] a bra with emotions
[1:28:03] but right now tell me the dread of
[1:28:06] Madness
[1:28:09] again
[1:28:19] and the vulgar thinks are the ones which
[1:28:21] are highly marketable
[1:28:25] hey people want to get more views on
[1:28:28] every single world like you get somebody
[1:28:30] on Tick Tock just put something funny
[1:28:34] and then he wants to attract many people
[1:28:36] to watch it
[1:28:38] on whatever kind of platform
[1:28:42] foreign
[1:28:55] you know he saw that in America There
[1:28:58] Rose up a beautiful woman leading the
[1:29:00] country
[1:29:04] now in that time in 1933 women were not
[1:29:08] voting or they were not participating in
[1:29:11] elections
[1:29:12] but now he's seeing that somebody has
[1:29:15] taken over everything
[1:29:17] and right now you see what's happening
[1:29:19] these things have been fulfilled now
[1:29:23] that's the sixth Vision now the seventh
[1:29:25] Vision
[1:29:27] because all these other things have been
[1:29:29] forced but number seven is not yet
[1:29:32] fulfilled but how close is number seven
[1:29:35] being full
[1:29:40] then he says
[1:29:44] he had a most terrible explosion
[1:29:48] and as it turned he saw nothing but
[1:29:52] debris
[1:29:54] creators
[1:29:55] and smoke no mercy all over the land of
[1:29:59] America America
[1:30:04] that's the last Vision no question by
[1:30:06] you and by the time Russia blows America
[1:30:10] because that's what God showed him that
[1:30:13] Russia Russia will destroy America
[1:30:18] now you see what's happening in Europe
[1:30:23] Russia Russia because it didn't want
[1:30:25] America to put
[1:30:27] you know they call them or Shields
[1:30:29] nuclear Shields some a military what
[1:30:32] close to its borders
[1:30:36] so when Ukraine was now being taken into
[1:30:39] the European Union
[1:30:44] like the Western World
[1:30:48] of course many years they've been
[1:30:50] negotiating and things have been failing
[1:30:54] so Russia started attacking Ukraine
[1:30:57] Russia
[1:30:59] and then Ukraine started getting weapons
[1:31:01] from other countries
[1:31:03] and the mercenaries
[1:31:09] now of about three or so times
[1:31:13] last year leaders from Russia
[1:31:17] they were coming out and saying we have
[1:31:22] nuclear weapons
[1:31:23] and we are going to destroy America
[1:31:27] foreign
[1:32:04] now these are things brother Branham
[1:32:07] talked about in 1933
[1:32:10] not showing him these things and now
[1:32:13] these men have come and they're saying
[1:32:15] we have everything is said
[1:32:21] but now I before that can happen
[1:32:24] because there is the name of Allah
[1:32:27] the Rapture must take place
[1:32:30] so the question is where are we
[1:32:35] foreign
[1:33:03] what are we doing today
[1:33:07] are we
[1:33:12] preparing ourselves
[1:33:15] how is our house
[1:33:17] is our house in order have we put
[1:33:21] everything in place
[1:33:23] because it is
[1:33:33] all those other countries
[1:33:35] religions are united religions
[1:33:39] I think last year also there was that
[1:33:42] thing of uniting abrahamic religions
[1:33:48] because Muslims believe in Abraham
[1:33:52] Christians believe in Abraham
[1:33:54] and even now and even now Jews believe
[1:33:57] in Abraham
[1:34:01] in the Arab world I think it is United
[1:34:05] Arab Emirates
[1:34:07] they built they have said they're
[1:34:10] setting up a place where all religions
[1:34:12] of the world can worship from one place
[1:34:15] foreign
[1:34:22] every other time buddhistawa what is it
[1:34:25] it's all about make sure
[1:34:28] the devil rules the world physically
[1:34:33] Revelations chapter 13.
[1:34:36] they are coming here to pass the man of
[1:34:40] sin um to sit on his throne and be
[1:34:43] worshiped like God
[1:34:45] so what time are we living here
[1:34:48] but all these things God has made them
[1:34:52] known to us through the minutes of our
[1:34:55] brothers
[1:34:58] so you have something to tell somebody
[1:35:02] challenging them the Lord has done this
[1:35:05] the Lord has done this
[1:35:08] praise the name of us let us go to
[1:35:13] to 1946.
[1:35:16] okay before you go there we did us go to
[1:35:18] number eight
[1:35:23] just below
[1:35:26] number eight
[1:35:31] so when brother Branham was baptizing
[1:35:36] so you can click on it
[1:35:40] so when brother Brandon was baptizing
[1:35:45] he had had a gospel kind of you know
[1:35:48] where many people had accepted the Lord
[1:35:49] Jesus as his their personal savior
[1:35:54] baptizing on River Ohio so when he was
[1:35:57] baptizing the 17th
[1:36:00] a light came from heaven
[1:36:03] and then he came where he was baptizing
[1:36:06] and then the voice saying it was praise
[1:36:10] the name of Allah that has John the
[1:36:13] Baptist
[1:36:14] was sent foreign
[1:36:52] you know
[1:36:54] just as you look what a plant growing
[1:36:58] praise the name you know when you plant
[1:37:01] a seed well same years ago you remember
[1:37:03] in the darker ages
[1:37:05] how worship was complete true worship
[1:37:08] was destroyed
[1:37:10] and then God started raising that seed
[1:37:13] to grow up
[1:37:15] during the ministry of Martin Luther who
[1:37:18] was our martini and he started preaching
[1:37:20] the just shall lived by friends
[1:37:23] so it was the seed growing and then when
[1:37:27] it comes to John Wesley
[1:37:30] praise the name of our Lord then he
[1:37:33] preached about sanctification
[1:37:35] they just shall live by faith
[1:37:38] praise the name of our Lord so the plant
[1:37:41] was growing
[1:37:43] praise the name of Allah
[1:37:47] like if we can go to Mark chapter 4.
[1:37:52] and then in verse 26.
[1:37:56] we shall get back to that website
[1:38:02] and so is the kingdom of God as if a man
[1:38:06] should cast seed into the ground and
[1:38:08] should sleep and Rise night and day and
[1:38:11] decision
[1:38:12] spring and grow up he knows not how much
[1:38:16] is
[1:38:32] and should sleep okay verse 28. for the
[1:38:36] year the Earth brings forth fast
[1:38:40] fourth fruit of ourself first the blood
[1:38:42] then the ear and after the full cone in
[1:38:46] the ear and see
[1:38:54] praise the name of Allah now so
[1:38:58] God
[1:39:00] himself
[1:39:02] started raising this scene and the first
[1:39:05] it was the blade
[1:39:08] and then brother Branham calls that
[1:39:12] justification the time of Martin Luther
[1:39:15] Martin Luther praise the name of Allah
[1:39:18] the time of Martin Luther Martin Luther
[1:39:25] it grew up
[1:39:28] praise the name of our Lord into
[1:39:33] because he calls the blood the tassel he
[1:39:37] calls the blood
[1:39:38] then he calls the tassel or the pollen
[1:39:41] yeah
[1:39:47] so in the Sandstone Church
[1:39:50] started growing
[1:39:52] then in the Philadelphia Philadelphia it
[1:39:56] you know it was putting on that kind of
[1:39:58] you know air yeah
[1:40:00] all the pollen
[1:40:03] you know so now after that then there
[1:40:08] was the restoration of gifts
[1:40:10] you remember in 1906
[1:40:13] there was the Holy Ghost falling on
[1:40:16] Azusa Street and then they were speaking
[1:40:19] in tongues the restoration of gifts
[1:40:22] praise the name of Allah now this is why
[1:40:26] I want to take some bit of attention
[1:40:28] you know the baptism of the holies
[1:40:38] but the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:40:42] is not the climax of this foreign
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:45] and the Bible says let us go
[1:41:50] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[1:41:53] the book of Hebrews chapter six
[1:41:57] Hebrews chapter six
[1:42:00] and I think it is verse 1.
[1:42:03] praise the name of our Lord
[1:42:06] Hebrews chapter 6 and verse one and then
[1:42:08] we read it
[1:42:10] he says therefore
[1:42:14] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:42:17] of Christ
[1:42:20] let me read and then you read therefore
[1:42:23] living the principles of the doctor
[1:42:26] Christ
[1:42:33] of repentance from the dwarks and of
[1:42:35] face toward god of the doctrine of
[1:42:38] baptisms and of laying on hands and of
[1:42:41] resurrection of the day and of Eternal
[1:42:43] judgment
[1:42:44] characters
[1:43:01] foreign
[1:43:25] it's a foundation
[1:43:27] repentance is foundation baptism is
[1:43:31] foundation that's what I'm saying
[1:43:32] baptism in waters
[1:43:34] is a foundation
[1:43:38] praise the name of it so our our
[1:43:42] Capstone
[1:43:44] our climax
[1:43:46] the purpose of this message
[1:43:49] is the change of our bodies
[1:43:52] we are in the second Exodus
[1:43:56] whether we understand Exodus the first
[1:44:00] exercise they were leaving Egypt
[1:44:03] from a physical land to a physical life
[1:44:06] the second Exodus our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:10] was leading them from religions a
[1:44:13] spiritual condition which is Fallen to
[1:44:16] the baptism of the Holy Spirit now here
[1:44:19] in the Sunday
[1:44:20] is the change of our bodies
[1:44:23] that's the full kind of redemption
[1:44:27] that's the purpose of this message
[1:44:33] that's what we have received and that is
[1:44:37] our our emphasis
[1:44:39] that's our emphasis you must have the
[1:44:43] life of Jesus Christ
[1:44:45] and to have the life of Jesus Christ God
[1:44:48] wants to harvest a mature fruit
[1:44:52] praise the name of Allah
[1:45:54] and when it starts putting foreign
[1:46:16] the hollow plant becomes dry color
[1:46:21] and this is what's happening the
[1:46:22] denominations now
[1:46:25] all dry
[1:46:27] why why because the life of Jesus Christ
[1:46:35] that's what's happening
[1:46:38] you know you go to their churches
[1:46:42] foreign
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:15] not only that but even their lives
[1:47:22] it's so different from the others
[1:47:26] shall not be here
[1:47:30] the shark is dry
[1:47:53] it's the mature
[1:47:57] praise the name of our Lord there is a
[1:47:59] pastor there who comes from
[1:48:03] another Pastor brought him for the
[1:48:05] meetings
[1:48:07] and then now he was telling us that is
[1:48:11] fellow pastors there
[1:48:12] he told them that he has read the Bible
[1:48:18] they told him you are going to become
[1:48:21] mad
[1:48:23] foreign
[1:48:42] there is no life we need to come where
[1:48:45] our life is and life is only in the
[1:48:48] message
[1:48:51] we are at the time of maturity
[1:48:55] we're in the time of harvest
[1:48:59] that the city that went into the ground
[1:49:03] is the one that has to be harvested this
[1:49:07] is the message
[1:49:08] this is the message that God has given
[1:49:11] so God knew how this generation is going
[1:49:14] to be
[1:49:16] and he sent us a prophet in our day
[1:49:19] praise the name of Allah he sent us a
[1:49:22] prophet in our day
[1:49:24] proclaiming the truth
[1:49:27] declaring the truth
[1:49:29] God knowing the end from the beginning
[1:49:35] so he has declared these things
[1:49:38] so we know where we stand we directly
[1:49:41] praise the name of Allah so the message
[1:49:43] that we have
[1:49:44] prepares us for the second coming of
[1:49:47] them
[1:49:48] the message that we have prepares
[1:49:52] the message that we have makes us the
[1:49:55] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:49:59] makes us the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50:02] so the message is washing us the message
[1:50:06] is
[1:50:08] praise the name of our Lord you need to
[1:50:10] take it seriously and when you have
[1:50:13] received it tell us
[1:50:16] invite another person
[1:50:19] share with them the goodness
[1:50:22] share with them What the Lord Has Done
[1:50:24] in our days
[1:50:32] God has declare them to us foreign
[1:51:29] so here brother Branham he was so
[1:51:33] desperate
[1:51:34] you know because other people were
[1:51:37] telling him the gift that you have are
[1:51:39] from the devil
[1:51:41] most of preachers who are telling him so
[1:51:45] he said let me go and wait on the Lord
[1:51:48] and let the Lord speak to me he told his
[1:51:52] wife I'm going I don't know if I'm going
[1:51:54] to come back so he went into prayer
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:52:01] and then he kept on praying Lord what is
[1:52:06] this why don't you take it away from me
[1:52:08] I don't understand why I'm late
[1:52:11] kept on praying and then now in the
[1:52:14] night he saw a light appearing
[1:52:18] a small light coming down as it became
[1:52:21] bigger okay
[1:52:23] and finally the light stood before him
[1:52:26] like a ball of light
[1:52:29] okay
[1:52:35] and then you told him I'm sent from the
[1:52:37] presence of God
[1:52:40] praise the name of it and then the angel
[1:52:43] told him I've come to tell you your
[1:52:46] strange life
[1:52:48] that you've been sent to the world
[1:52:51] with a gift to the people
[1:52:54] and the angel told him go and tell the
[1:52:57] people of the world
[1:53:03] that they are thoughts are hard louder
[1:53:07] than their words in heaven
[1:53:34] is interested in that I didn't date you
[1:53:37] you told him started explaining to him
[1:53:41] based on the scripture and showing him
[1:53:44] this
[1:53:46] and then the angel told him you are sent
[1:53:49] to the world with two signs
[1:53:53] foreign
[1:54:26] foreign
[1:54:53] two signs
[1:54:55] now okay the fastest sign to us on the
[1:54:59] body the second sign was on the human
[1:55:03] spirit
[1:55:06] and then you know the first design are
[1:55:08] coming after soccer the first people
[1:55:09] soccer the second sign the second poll
[1:55:13] score but they start the pool will speak
[1:55:17] the world
[1:55:19] a higher level
[1:55:23] speak the word what do you have need I
[1:55:26] give to your children like before sister
[1:55:30] I give you your son when the sister Meda
[1:55:34] was in hospital before the doctors let
[1:55:38] the tumor disappear when he was hunting
[1:55:40] and he needed then the voice
[1:55:49] then the voice told him
[1:55:52] then it came then he shot it yeah
[1:55:57] goes to the song
[1:56:03] and it's the climax the highest climax
[1:56:07] the level the Lord has brought us that
[1:56:11] you receive the word of God and that
[1:56:13] word transforms and that's the word
[1:56:16] translation even your words they become
[1:56:19] of you as good as the word of the master
[1:56:23] praise the name of God this is what the
[1:56:25] Lord wants us to grow up
[1:56:28] that you just speak and happen but he
[1:56:32] wants to change your mind I want to take
[1:56:35] over your mind
[1:56:36] take over your heart once take over all
[1:56:40] your your passions
[1:56:45] praise the name of that so
[1:56:49] the two signs happening
[1:56:51] praise the name of Allah they've got
[1:56:54] fulfilled
[1:56:57] in the ministry of brother Branham um
[1:57:01] you know and then the Angels told him
[1:57:04] that these things because he told him
[1:57:07] that let the people believe you
[1:57:11] so he gave him the two signs and told
[1:57:15] him as Moses was sent with two sons
[1:57:22] and they come to pass
[1:57:26] blessed be the name of our Lord so the
[1:57:28] message that we have God has confirmed
[1:57:31] it
[1:57:33] praise the name of Allah with a lot of
[1:57:36] Spanish
[1:57:38] praise the name of our Lord declaring
[1:57:42] the end from the beginning coming in our
[1:57:46] generation telling us the things that
[1:57:49] are going to be here
[1:57:50] so you need to take it with all your
[1:57:53] heart not only taking it with your heart
[1:57:56] tell somebody about What the Lord Has
[1:57:58] Done In Our Generation
[1:58:01] the Lord has sent us a prophet the Lord
[1:58:04] has given us a message
[1:58:07] prepare
[1:58:09] the message prepare us
[1:58:15] then number 11.
[1:58:21] when he was preaching the second sign
[1:58:25] appeared and all through his ministry he
[1:58:30] had the ability
[1:58:32] now this way I want to come again
[1:58:37] now discernment of the spirit
[1:58:41] is the sign of the Messiah
[1:58:46] praise the name of Allah are you hearing
[1:58:49] me the discernment of the spirit
[1:58:52] like it the person would stand before
[1:58:55] him and then he would descend it is a
[1:58:59] sign of the Messiah
[1:59:01] he remembered the woman
[1:59:04] in John chapter 4 he says when the
[1:59:07] Messiah comes he will tell us
[1:59:10] what did he say I am
[1:59:22] he says oh
[1:59:25] you are Peter Peter the son of Jonas
[1:59:30] how did he know that his name was
[1:59:34] his name is Simon how do you know that
[1:59:37] his father is Jonas
[1:59:43] and then now when he meets
[1:59:47] let us go to John chapter 1.
[1:59:52] praise the name of Allah
[1:59:56] and then verse 40.
[2:00:00] one of the two which spoke which had
[2:00:03] John speak and followed him was Andrew
[2:00:06] Simon Peter's brother
[2:00:12] John chapter 1 verse 40.
[2:00:18] foreign
[2:00:23] he findeth his own brother Simon and he
[2:00:26] says unto him we have found the Messiahs
[2:00:31] which is being interpreted the Christ
[2:00:36] away yes
[2:00:44] and he brought him to
[2:00:49] he said though at Simon the son of Jonah
[2:00:54] the child called selfas which is
[2:00:56] interpretation a stone
[2:01:15] this morning
[2:01:17] your father is
[2:01:22] the sign of the Messiah
[2:01:27] who is that one before me and my soul
[2:01:30] praise the name of Allah and even this
[2:01:33] message
[2:01:34] when you hear it
[2:01:40] I believe you enjoyed the brother covers
[2:01:43] his ministries
[2:01:47] I listen to it that night and was very
[2:01:50] wonderful
[2:01:53] providing us
[2:01:59] someone got the physical swords
[2:02:02] already brought the physical song
[2:02:06] and then the women had to display their
[2:02:09] true characters
[2:03:03] Jesus just was showing the sign of the
[2:03:06] Messiah
[2:03:08] and then Philip Philippe of beside
[2:03:12] the city
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:48] they may tell you that is
[2:03:55] foreign
[2:04:39] equator
[2:04:45] Spirit
[2:04:47] what happened yesterday you were in a
[2:04:50] fig tree
[2:04:55] and then nothing else
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:08] then the woman at the world go and call
[2:05:11] your husband
[2:05:13] say true you don't have the one you have
[2:05:17] is not yours
[2:05:22] so he was able to see all that period of
[2:05:25] time
[2:05:26] maybe in 1910
[2:05:30] 1915
[2:05:33] you were seeing all of them
[2:05:40] you are the Messiah you're a prophet now
[2:05:44] where does this come from
[2:05:47] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[2:05:49] Genesis chapter 18.
[2:05:53] praise the name of our Lord
[2:05:55] Genesis chapter 18.
[2:06:01] and then we read from verse
[2:06:10] verse 9.
[2:06:15] and they said unto him
[2:06:17] where is Sarah thy wife
[2:06:24] how did they know
[2:06:26] now this this is God putting on the
[2:06:28] flesh
[2:06:31] walking with two angels
[2:06:35] praise the name of Allah and you know
[2:06:37] Jesus in John chapter 6 he told the Jews
[2:06:42] Abraham saw my days
[2:06:47] of Jesus
[2:06:51] put on flesh and then he came before
[2:06:55] Abraham
[2:06:57] and then he came before Abraham
[2:07:01] and then after he has been given food to
[2:07:04] eat with the angels
[2:07:12] you know there are some of those popular
[2:07:14] preachers
[2:07:21] somebody is having headaches
[2:07:26] tell us who the person is
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:29] not gambling
[2:07:33] somebody has a backup problem
[2:07:36] when you grow all the back problem comes
[2:07:39] you didn't work
[2:07:42] just gamblers
[2:07:47] you know the devil is so deceptive
[2:07:50] and now what what the devil has told
[2:07:52] them
[2:07:54] um
[2:08:05] where do you get that in the scriptures
[2:08:17] if you buy my portrait
[2:08:20] it's foreign
[2:08:55] of God
[2:08:58] my woman of God but the mighty man of
[2:09:01] God the mighty woman of God is all the
[2:09:04] time in Evil movie
[2:09:10] The Power of God which can set them free
[2:09:13] from those not there
[2:09:17] if you have the power of God let that
[2:09:20] power of God start by changing yourself
[2:09:26] deliver it from your bondage
[2:09:30] those that received himself
[2:09:42] where is the power which sets them free
[2:09:45] in your life
[2:09:47] foreign
[2:10:38] foreign foreign
[2:11:16] Luke 17 30.
[2:11:18] even thus shall it be when the son of
[2:11:23] man is revealed which river
[2:11:28] you came to reveal the son of man
[2:11:31] that was the signs
[2:11:35] in Luke 17. then in verse 26 as it was
[2:11:41] in the days
[2:11:43] we see the days of nowhere here and
[2:11:46] everything
[2:11:47] then we continue
[2:11:50] foreign
[2:12:21] you know in the days of Noah Noah praise
[2:12:25] the name of Allah they had the prophets
[2:13:14] you know they were homosexuals we see
[2:13:18] the same thing happening today
[2:13:20] so
[2:13:22] in the days of Noah there was a prophet
[2:13:25] the days of Lords there was a prophet
[2:13:27] now if we are in the same days
[2:13:35] because the scripture has to be full
[2:13:39] okay
[2:13:41] so now in the days
[2:13:46] displayed the sign of the Messiah
[2:13:51] and he displayed the sign of the Messiah
[2:13:54] he fought the change of the bodies of
[2:13:57] Abraham and Sarah a child
[2:14:01] he displayed the sign of them before
[2:14:06] the change of the bodies of Abraham and
[2:14:09] Sons
[2:14:13] we are expecting the change of our
[2:14:16] brothers
[2:14:17] so even the sign of the Messiah has to
[2:14:21] be displayed to this universe
[2:14:27] comes with that praise the name of her
[2:14:29] he fulfills the scripture as the prophet
[2:14:32] in this generation as it was in the days
[2:14:36] as it was in the days of life in the
[2:14:39] days of Noah about the message of
[2:14:41] Deliverance
[2:14:50] was sent with the message
[2:14:55] in the days
[2:15:01] Abraham prayed foreign
[2:15:05] foreign
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:49] if another person comes with a sign of
[2:16:52] the Messiah
[2:16:54] when we have seen that he has been
[2:16:56] fulfilled in our generation
[2:17:04] let me repeat it
[2:17:07] you know there are some people who want
[2:17:08] to go oh yes
[2:17:10] there's someone who can do miracles
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:14] Miracles are here
[2:17:18] why right because the Lord is here why
[2:17:22] do you want to manga from here
[2:17:29] you know like there are some people
[2:17:31] whatever oh I wish I was there on the
[2:17:33] Dolphins
[2:17:41] then you remember oh God you sent the
[2:17:44] prophet in our generation I wish I was
[2:17:47] in Brandon Tabernacle I stand in the
[2:17:49] prayer life
[2:17:54] you don't need that oh do it I'll give
[2:17:57] you what does the Bible says
[2:18:15] then what happens

[2:18:34] you just don't need that which I gave
[2:18:36] you the Lord is here
[2:18:38] somebody I know
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:41] how many conventions did the Cornelius
[2:18:44] have in his house
[2:18:47] it was just his personal dedication to
[2:18:50] God
[2:18:52] and then the angel came down when he was
[2:18:55] praying and the angel told him call for
[2:18:58] Peter and for him he just continued
[2:19:00] praying telling his friends
[2:19:08] but why have you called foreign
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:20:11] of the Lord
[2:20:24] that was it and now in that dream it was
[2:20:28] as if we're moving from one level to
[2:20:29] another level
[2:20:31] and then trying to climb around but
[2:20:35] there are things you step on and then
[2:20:37] now you step on this side and then it's
[2:20:40] as if it is
[2:20:42] and as if you are coming down but you
[2:20:45] want to go up and then I was with some
[2:20:47] of my friends I used to work with or
[2:20:49] start the wheels
[2:20:52] climbing and it was a struggle to reach
[2:20:55] the next level
[2:20:58] and then as if something is there when
[2:21:01] you you are afraid it will break and
[2:21:03] then you go down away now I woke up in
[2:21:06] the morning
[2:21:08] this is strange
[2:21:12] then what came to my mind the ladder to
[2:21:15] Heaven is very clear
[2:21:19] doesn't have intrigues like these ones
[2:21:22] this is
[2:21:23] hide and seek you're meant to do this
[2:21:26] but again it's not today
[2:21:28] the things of God are clear
[2:21:31] and I told the devil the question away
[2:21:34] with your sins
[2:21:39] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[2:21:42] says he has already weakened Us in
[2:21:45] Heavenly places in Christ so it is too
[2:21:49] late for the devil to deceive me on life
[2:21:52] because the things of God are clear
[2:21:55] repent every one of you people tells the
[2:21:59] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:22:01] receive the gift of God it doesn't
[2:22:03] change his goals but now the devil can
[2:22:06] come and tell you you're not going to
[2:22:09] make them tell you now
[2:22:11] no no no you are out there
[2:22:16] shut up
[2:22:17] [Applause]
[2:22:19] you just reject those things
[2:22:23] but some people want to now be traveled
[2:22:26] about that
[2:22:28] they told me this or no
[2:22:31] see yourself in the mirror of the world
[2:22:36] see yourself in the middle of the world
[2:22:38] what does the Lord speak about it what
[2:22:41] are the promises don't look at your
[2:22:44] weakness don't look what your failure
[2:22:46] look what the promise of God
[2:22:49] praise the name of us
[2:22:54] yes
[2:23:00] he says it's the high priest
[2:23:04] what is your confession
[2:23:07] failure of Victory
[2:23:10] and it shouldn't be negative in your
[2:23:12] life
[2:23:13] even when you fail no I will arise
[2:23:19] I will arise
[2:23:21] I'm not going to fail here foreign
[2:23:36] blessed be the holy name God has sent us
[2:23:40] a message
[2:23:44] now time has gone and I need so I finish
[2:23:48] let us go back to the other side
[2:23:53] 1960 I think the way we should go now
[2:23:57] praise the name of our Lord you know
[2:24:00] when brother branham's minutes was
[2:24:02] rejected
[2:24:05] god cartoon
[2:24:07] gave him
[2:24:09] an experience
[2:24:11] which will never live his life
[2:24:14] let us go down
[2:24:20] 1960 that's a number 14.
[2:24:28] Beyond The Cutting of time
[2:24:30] so brother Branham was on his bed
[2:24:32] pondering what's going to be
[2:24:40] they work so
[2:24:41] in that experience he was lying on his
[2:24:45] bed and his wife was also on the same
[2:24:48] bed and then the voice talked to him do
[2:24:52] you want to look Beyond Time
[2:25:29] then it started
[2:25:33] maybe now I've already died
[2:25:38] and then the voice told him these are
[2:25:40] all your people
[2:25:43] he said ah we don't have many brown arms
[2:25:47] The Voice told him no no these are your
[2:25:51] converts to
[2:25:55] christu and then you know it was showing
[2:25:57] different things and then when he
[2:26:00] reached there you don't want to go back
[2:26:03] say no you have to go back go until you
[2:26:06] know who are you
[2:26:08] now the message that we have
[2:26:12] praise the name of our Lord we know
[2:26:15] where we are going
[2:26:17] crazy we know where we are going
[2:26:21] and it's a better place
[2:26:26] then why would you give time to people
[2:26:28] who are contrary to the message
[2:26:32] why would you give ear to some preacher
[2:26:37] who doesn't tell you God has sent us a
[2:26:40] message
[2:26:45] where
[2:26:46] but God showed him
[2:26:48] even he showed him my certain brother
[2:26:51] came and hugged him about 17 18 years I
[2:26:55] said that one there you converted them
[2:26:58] to Christ when he was 93 years so but
[2:27:00] now it's just yes
[2:27:02] and brother Brandon I'm saying there was
[2:27:05] no yesterday
[2:27:09] the message that God has given unto us
[2:27:14] this thing is not gambling
[2:27:17] let us collect the money we pray for his
[2:27:21] soul

[2:29:13] to those missions
[2:29:15] the last service many times if I have
[2:29:18] one service I take two to three hours
[2:29:21] sometime
[2:29:22] there is a place I preached for four
[2:29:25] hours without stop
[2:29:27] just telling them about brother Branham
[2:29:30] and the message God has sentences
[2:29:32] for hours that was in busana
[2:29:35] then there's a time we had a meeting in
[2:29:38] ebusini number I spent about three hours
[2:29:42] talking about the same thing
[2:29:45] say that people can have confidence
[2:29:48] that the message that we have is not of
[2:29:51] mine it's the Lord himself
[2:29:55] so in 1964 in July

[2:36:01] of Christ
[2:36:03] she was fully dressed
[2:36:10] and then he saw from different nations
[2:36:17] so we know that really what will become
[2:36:20] of

[2:37:19] let us go to Genesis chapter 49 verse
[2:37:22] 33.
[2:37:30] 49.33

[2:37:36] of commanding his sons he gathered up
[2:37:39] his feet into the bed and you will adopt
[2:37:44] The Ghost and was gathered unto his
[2:37:48] people
[2:37:50] uh
[2:38:03] he says when he died he was gathered
[2:38:08] unto his Spirit now Gathering here is
[2:38:11] not barring
[2:38:15] because Jacob was buried in Genesis
[2:38:18] chapter 50 verse 13.
[2:38:23] for his sons carried him into the land
[2:38:26] of Canaan and buried them in the cave of
