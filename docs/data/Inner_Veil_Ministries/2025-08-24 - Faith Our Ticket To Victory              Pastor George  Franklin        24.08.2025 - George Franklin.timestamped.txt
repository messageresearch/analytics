[39:35] &gt;&gt; Father, I want to bless your name this
[39:36] afternoon.
[39:39] [Music]
[39:41] [Applause]
[39:42] For we have been taught
[39:46] &gt;&gt; that we have got to have a revival
[39:49] in the things that you have given to us.
[39:53] Because the revival of the bride
[39:56] is the seven thunder message.
[40:00] Seven thunder message because you are
[40:02] make us to know. It is this div mystery
[40:06] truth
[40:10] that will literally turn the heart of
[40:11] the children
[40:14] back to the apostolic
[40:17] and exactly so. We thank you for the way
[40:20] you are stare our hearts.
[40:22] in remembrance of the things that you
[40:24] are given through the prophets
[40:27] to give to us. And we thank you for the
[40:29] blessing you are delivered to us.
[40:32] We have come again under your feet
[40:35] to feast on the bread of life that come
[40:37] down from heaven
[40:39] Lord. We are trusting you.
[40:42] We are depending upon you. We are
[40:44] calling upon your name. Feed our soul
[40:48] that our soul will be filled.
[40:51] that every cup will be filled,
[40:54] every soul will be healed,
[40:56] every person will be healed. That at the
[40:59] end of this service, Father, there will
[41:02] not be a favor with our mid. This is our
[41:04] prayer. This is our asking. This our
[41:08] longing, this our request. I pray grant
[41:11] it onto us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[41:15] Thank you, Father Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:22] Hallelujah.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[41:35] As we are standing on our feet,
[41:39] I want us to turn to 2 Corinthians
[41:41] chapter 2
[41:46] because the pastor had told me that we
[41:48] are going to have a prayer line.
[41:56] Okay. Second Corinthian chapter 1. 2
[42:00] Corinthians chapter 1
[42:03] verse 18- 24.
[42:13] But as God is true,
[42:17] our word towards you was not a name.
[42:21] For the son of God, Jesus Christ, who
[42:23] was preached among you by us, even by me
[42:27] and Sylvanas and Timotus, was not and
[42:29] but in him was here.
[42:43] For all the promise of God in him are
[42:44] here and in him amen to the glory of God
[42:48] by us.
[43:09] Now he which establishes you in uh
[43:12] establishes us with you in Christ and
[43:15] anointed us is God.
[43:41] who has also sealed us and given the
[43:43] eness of the spirit in our hearts.
[43:51] Moreover, I call God for a record upon
[43:53] your soul and to spare you, I came not
[43:56] as unto courage.
[44:10] Not for that we have dominion over your
[44:12] face, but are helper of your joy. For by
[44:15] faith you stand.
[44:32] Father we bless your name for this word
[44:34] in Jesus name.
[44:36] We have our seat
[44:42] &gt;&gt; this our evening
[44:45] from where we read from in second
[44:47] Corinthian chapter 2 I mean 1 verse 18
[44:50] down 24.
[44:56] I want to take a test and call it faith.
[45:00] Our ticket victory.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Our ticket to victory.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Before I came to Uganda here
[45:19] after I have assessed my visa.
[45:26] The airline told me
[45:29] aine,
[45:34] &gt;&gt; they need a certified ticket.
[45:40] And for me to acquire that ticket,
[45:44] I have to present something
[45:48] before they can give me tickets.
[45:50] And the thing I have to present was
[45:52] money.
[45:55] And they told me how much it will take
[45:58] me
[46:00] to take them to take me to Uganda.
[46:06] Uganda.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So when I release the money,
[46:10] they send my ticket to me.
[46:13] And because they have sent the ticket to
[46:14] me now,
[46:16] I was qualified to board their plane.
[46:21] So I went to the airport.
[46:24] I went to their office.
[46:28] They check my whatever they check my
[46:30] name.
[46:32] They saw my name. I have paid the money
[46:35] and I show them the ticket
[46:37] that they claim me.
[46:40] I qualify to enter that aine.
[46:46] That's why they brought me here.
[46:48] It was the tickets
[46:51] that I paid for that brought me to
[46:54] Uganda. So that's why I want to preach
[46:56] this. Faith is our ticket
[47:01] to your victory.
[47:04] Once you have that faith,
[47:06] you have got the ticket.
[47:09] All victory.
[47:14] Faith
[47:16] &gt;&gt; is our ticket.
[47:18] All victory. All victory.
[47:22] I'll be listing the victory one by one.
[47:27] Because when we talk about faith,
[47:30] there is no way you can operate with God
[47:32] outside of faith.
[47:36] He that come to God
[47:39] is a must.
[47:42] It's a must.
[47:45] You must believe.
[47:48] Believe in God is a must.
[47:53] No, you shall
[47:56] the only way you can access God
[47:59] is by faith.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And that is why you sitting down here,
[48:10] me standing here, we are here by faith.
[48:13] [Applause]
[48:14] We can't stand the way we stand.
[48:18] You can't see the way you sit without
[48:20] faith.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm telling you this evening,
[48:25] faith is your victory is your ticket.
[48:30] All victory
[48:32] when you can have faith. There is no
[48:35] victory you cannot enjoy.
[48:39] And that is why if there were people
[48:41] that supposed to have faith today,
[48:45] you and me because we are the bride of
[48:48] Jesus Christ.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if anybody still
[48:53] doubting it
[48:55] that you are not the bride. This message
[48:57] of the hour
[48:59] is strictly to the bride.
[49:04] Yes sir. Yes sir.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; This message is to the bride.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; If you are not the bride of Jesus,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; you will not accept the message because
[49:15] it's a message that God has sent to call
[49:18] his wife.
[49:22] And when we talk about husband and wife,
[49:27] we talk about love.
[49:30] It is love that brings courtship.
[49:36] It is love that brings obedience.
[49:40] It is love that brings marriage.
[49:43] And that is where we are heading to.
[49:47] That's where we are heading to.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; That's where we are heading to.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Heading to heading to
[49:57] &gt;&gt; the marriage supper of the lamb.
[50:02] Now listen,
[50:05] love
[50:06] is not something that we learn.
[50:10] It's part of us
[50:13] &gt;&gt; because God is love
[50:17] and we are part of God.
[50:19] So if you are part of God, we are part
[50:21] of everything that God is.
[50:26] That's why Jesus when he was here say I
[50:29] am the light of the world. When he was
[50:31] going, he point to us that we are the
[50:34] light.
[50:35] We are the light
[50:39] because anything God is,
[50:42] we are part of it. Because the Bible
[50:44] says for he pleased the father
[50:48] that the fullness of the godhead will
[50:50] dwell in him
[50:54] and we are complete in him.
[50:58] Amen. Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; You can't separate us from God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; You can't separate God from us.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; We are part of one another.
[51:09] This is the mind of God.
[51:12] That is why when God roll out his
[51:14] program, roll rolled out his program.
[51:18] Rolled out
[51:20] rolled out.
[51:29] When he roll out his program,
[51:33] it started with marriage.
[51:36] Marriage is God's program.
[51:40] The reason God made this word,
[51:44] he made this word to take a bride.
[51:50] That is the reason God made this word.
[51:53] He made his word to take a church which
[51:57] is his bride out of the church. That is
[52:00] the most important on earth and
[52:03] important.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; The most important on earth
[52:09] and that is why he started in the garden
[52:12] of Eden
[52:14] with marriage.
[52:17] He was rolling out his plan.
[52:22] Do you know why Adam
[52:25] followed the woman? Follow the woman.
[52:30] Now
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Adam
[52:33] &gt;&gt; was not deceived.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; It was a woman
[52:38] &gt;&gt; that was deceived
[52:40] into transgression. Adam was not
[52:42] deceived.
[52:44] This is why when God want to put the
[52:47] blame because of Adam's head,
[52:51] he call it Adam's transgression.
[52:55] Adam was not the one that transgressed.
[52:58] But because Adam followed the woman
[53:02] Adam's transgression,
[53:04] you know better.
[53:10] You know better.
[53:13] Why did Adam follow the woman?
[53:16] Because God when he made a man,
[53:19] Adam did not tell God that he need a
[53:21] wife.
[53:26] No, it was God that said, "It's no good
[53:30] for a man to be alone.
[53:33] He make Adam to sleep.
[53:36] He took a ri from Adam.
[53:39] He made the woman.
[53:41] He took the feminine spirit from Adam.
[53:44] He put it on the woman
[53:47] and he brought the woman to Adam. When
[53:49] Adam see the woman, he said, "This is
[53:52] bone of my bone, the flesh of my flesh,
[53:55] you shall be called woman."
[54:00] Adam name woman
[54:03] [Music]
[54:06] &gt;&gt; because
[54:08] she he was in the likeness of Adam
[54:12] &gt;&gt; just as Adam was in the likeness of God.
[54:16] Amen. Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Why did Adam follow the woman? Because
[54:22] the low part of Adam
[54:25] was taken from him and put on that
[54:27] woman.
[54:29] So the woman is in love part of a man.
[54:34] So because of the love that Adam have on
[54:37] the world. This is the reason Adam
[54:40] forsake the earth.
[54:42] He forsook the earth. He forsook life.
[54:47] He forsook everything and he followed
[54:49] the woman. What make follow the woman?
[54:55] Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; That's all it because of love and that's
[55:00] why love is a very strong thing
[55:04] until the Bible says love covered
[55:07] multitude of sin.
[55:12] Love heal.
[55:14] Love delivers
[55:17] in God's economy.
[55:20] Love is one of the greatest weapon.
[55:25] When you receive the love of God in your
[55:29] heart, nothing can conquer you.
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:35] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing,
[55:37] greatest thing in God's economy is love.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; And that is why in this last days,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; love is so scarce.
[55:54] Yes,
[55:55] love is so scared
[55:58] &gt;&gt; that it will only be found
[56:01] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the illlet.
[56:10] Only Christian can love.
[56:15] If you are not a Christian, you cannot
[56:16] love.
[56:20] This is why we will talk about
[56:21] forgiveness.
[56:23] Only Christian can forgive
[56:31] love,
[56:32] &gt;&gt; it's a serious thing
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and it's a strong thing and God is love.
[56:42] The reason you see war
[56:45] everywhere in the world today is lack of
[56:49] love.
[56:51] in the church. The reason you see
[56:54] competition
[56:56] is lack of love.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Competition
[57:04] is lack of love
[57:10] &gt;&gt; in the church. The reason you see
[57:13] superiority
[57:15] is lack of love.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Love is lacking.
[57:26] is so scarce
[57:28] &gt;&gt; that it is only found in the midst
[57:34] of the elites.
[57:37] Only the saints can love.
[57:41] So from the beginning it was a love
[57:44] affair.
[57:47] It was love that make Adam
[57:51] forsook the world,
[57:54] forsook life
[57:56] and he followed the wife. It is the same
[57:59] thing today.
[58:01] That's why God
[58:04] himself because of love he left his
[58:07] kingdom.
[58:09] He left his kingdom. He came down for
[58:13] you and me with his love.
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:18] &gt;&gt; He left his his his comfort
[58:22] and he came to for you and me. That's
[58:26] what the Bible says. For God so loved
[58:28] the world
[58:31] that the game is only because
[58:38] the most valuable thing in heaven
[58:41] because of love
[58:43] God release it.
[58:48] The most important thing in heaven
[58:51] because of love God release it. And that
[58:54] is why when you find grace
[58:58] &gt;&gt; to have an understanding
[59:00] of what the love of God is all about,
[59:03] you will not have an enemy.
[59:05] [Music]
[59:07] You will know there's only one enemy.
[59:12] Your brother can never be your enemy.
[59:16] Why? Because you will know is a creator
[59:19] of God.
[59:21] Whatever situation he is,
[59:24] it is the devil
[59:27] will you without understanding
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:32] and that's what we have been taught
[59:35] without law nobody enter heaven
[59:41] the enter heaven
[59:45] is divine law
[59:48] when the prophet William was taken to
[59:50] the paradise
[59:52] to the sixth dimension.
[59:54] The voice told me nothing enter
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:04] what is divine law. Divine law
[1:00:13] because there are different kind of
[1:00:14] love.
[1:00:17] Every man
[1:00:20] that is born by a woman.
[1:00:23] He have feel your love in his spirit.
[1:00:29] And that feel love is the love he have
[1:00:32] for his friends,
[1:00:34] for his children, for his wife.
[1:00:38] That love is political.
[1:00:41] He's selfish. That's not God.
[1:00:46] Everybody sit down here. You have love
[1:00:49] as safe in your spirit. That's not God.
[1:00:54] The love I'm talking about, it has to
[1:00:56] come from your soul.
[1:00:59] If your soul is not from God, you cannot
[1:01:03] have that love
[1:01:06] because we talk about love.
[1:01:08] You have to be a part of love.
[1:01:11] For love to be a part of you and the
[1:01:13] only way that can happen, you have to be
[1:01:16] the gene of God.
[1:01:19] And the G of God in you is your soul.
[1:01:23] And that your G is the word of God. And
[1:01:27] that is the word that hear the word of
[1:01:29] God
[1:01:30] and make you receive the word of God
[1:01:33] because the Bible says when the deep
[1:01:35] call to the deep to respond. So if you
[1:01:39] don't have that deep, no response. No
[1:01:43] response.
[1:01:45] You can't respond to God.
[1:01:47] That's why Jesus was saying when my
[1:01:50] sheep hear my voice
[1:01:54] Jesus have his own sheep.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; In fact what Jesus have
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; his sheep.
[1:02:03] Everyone that is of God
[1:02:07] is a sheep because he is a shepherd.
[1:02:12] A shepherd does not shepherd goats.
[1:02:18] He doesn't shepherd cow.
[1:02:22] No,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; he's a shepherd because he shepher
[1:02:26] sheep.
[1:02:29] That's why the sheep
[1:02:40] in Psalm 100 verse three. Psalm 100
[1:02:45] verse3
[1:02:48] 100
[1:02:52] it is like this. He said know ye that
[1:02:57] the Lord is God.
[1:02:59] He's the one that made us not we
[1:03:01] ourself. We are his people and the sheep
[1:03:05] of his pasture.
[1:03:08] We are sheep of his pasture.
[1:03:11] And when a sheep is the only animal
[1:03:14] that when he's lost, he cannot find his
[1:03:16] way.
[1:03:19] This is why he needs a leader.
[1:03:23] And the leader of the sheep
[1:03:26] is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:30] is the Holy Ghost. And that is why when
[1:03:33] we were lost,
[1:03:35] God sent forth the Holy Ghost to go and
[1:03:39] be looking for us just the way he was
[1:03:41] looking for Adam in the Garden of Eden,
[1:03:45] he was looking for us. Let me tell you
[1:03:47] something. Do you know
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; that when Adam
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; transgress
[1:03:54] when Adam transgressed
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; and he was separated from God?
[1:04:00] The Bible says Adam and wife they saw
[1:04:03] fig leaves
[1:04:06] together and they covered themselves.
[1:04:09] They were they cover themselves with the
[1:04:11] fig leaves.
[1:04:14] Adam was comfortable with the fig
[1:04:17] leaves.
[1:04:20] The wife was comfortable with the fig
[1:04:22] leaves. They were not having any problem
[1:04:26] until they heard the voice of God.
[1:04:32] Until they heard the voice of God.
[1:04:36] When they heard the voice of God, Adam
[1:04:39] do two things.
[1:04:42] He ran away.
[1:04:46] Why? Because he was afraid. But when he
[1:04:49] saw fig leaves,
[1:04:52] he was not afraid.
[1:04:54] That is to show you any man. Whatever
[1:04:57] you are doing, you will be satisfied.
[1:05:00] When you hear the voice of God,
[1:05:04] when you hear the voice of God, is he
[1:05:06] want to tell you if you are right or
[1:05:09] wrong.
[1:05:11] That's what the Bible says.
[1:05:13] There is a way that see right to a man.
[1:05:21] A man never know the way is wrong
[1:05:24] until you hear the voice of God. The
[1:05:27] voice of God will expose you if you are
[1:05:30] right or wrong.
[1:05:34] You will not know you are wrong until
[1:05:36] you hear the voice of God. Because the
[1:05:39] voice of God is the only thing that is
[1:05:41] right.
[1:05:42] So when you are right, he will encourage
[1:05:44] you. When you are wrong, he will condemn
[1:05:47] you.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And that is why when Adam heard the
[1:05:53] voice,
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; he hide himself.
[1:05:59] He was afraid.
[1:06:02] That's why when we are in the presence
[1:06:06] of God
[1:06:08] and God is speaking,
[1:06:11] it bring a secret atmosphere.
[1:06:15] Put fear in your heart
[1:06:18] because the Bible says the fear of God
[1:06:21] is the beginning of wisdom.
[1:06:25] That's what God does. His presence
[1:06:28] is pres
[1:06:31] atmosphere.
[1:06:32] a sacred atmosphere
[1:06:35] that make you to be scared.
[1:06:38] That's why there is nobody can stand the
[1:06:40] voice of God
[1:06:42] physically. This is why God choose to
[1:06:45] use men
[1:06:50] choose to use men to speak.
[1:06:53] And that's why even when men are
[1:06:55] anointed
[1:06:57] and they are speaking the voice of God
[1:07:00] and you are not right with that voice
[1:07:04] they condemnation you
[1:07:08] that you will know this is not a man
[1:07:10] talking to me.
[1:07:12] This is the word of God because it is
[1:07:15] only the word of God that have the
[1:07:17] capability
[1:07:18] to change your heart
[1:07:22] to check your heart because he's living
[1:07:26] and powerful and is a designer of the
[1:07:30] thoughts and the intent of men. That is
[1:07:34] the power of the word of God. I get that
[1:07:37] from.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; So what am I saying?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; It was love
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; that made Adam
[1:07:46] fulfilled everything.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[1:07:50] marriage
[1:07:52] should be based on love.
[1:07:56] The foundation of marriage is love.
[1:08:04] The prophet taught us
[1:08:06] When a woman
[1:08:09] marry a man
[1:08:11] and he doesn't love him,
[1:08:13] when rapture comes,
[1:08:16] when rapture comes,
[1:08:18] during rapture, that woman will not go
[1:08:20] with that man.
[1:08:25] If a man marry a woman outside of love,
[1:08:30] when rapture come and that woman goes,
[1:08:34] the man will not go. Anything
[1:08:39] that does not love you the way you are
[1:08:41] go with the rapture.
[1:08:46] And that is why when we talk about
[1:08:49] marriage, the foundation of marriage is
[1:08:53] love.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; When you see a man and you don't love
[1:09:00] him,
[1:09:02] don't marry him.
[1:09:04] Because it will be difficult for you to
[1:09:07] be obedient to him.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; It is love that brings obedience.
[1:09:18] Is love that brings obedience.
[1:09:21] When you love somebody, you will not
[1:09:24] like to hurt the person.
[1:09:29] That is why the Bible says every man
[1:09:32] should love his wife the way he love
[1:09:35] himself
[1:09:39] because you cannot mit yourself
[1:09:45] who can here
[1:09:49] you will nourish
[1:09:51] and cherish yourself. That is the way a
[1:09:55] man should do to his wife.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's a commandment and it's an
[1:10:01] instruction that when you are planning
[1:10:04] to get married,
[1:10:06] marry a woman that you love.
[1:10:10] And let me tell you something about
[1:10:12] love. You have feeling
[1:10:15] there is a bond.
[1:10:18] He has a bond magnet. When you come
[1:10:22] close to person you love, there's an
[1:10:25] attraction.
[1:10:27] It's an attraction.
[1:10:30] For example,
[1:10:32] if you see a young man that is looking
[1:10:34] for a wife in this place now, when you
[1:10:38] see a woman in love,
[1:10:40] she may not be the most beautiful.
[1:10:43] She may not be the most educated. She
[1:10:45] may not be the most rich, but there's
[1:10:47] something about that woman. Anytime
[1:10:50] you come around that woman there is an
[1:10:53] impulse
[1:10:55] attraction
[1:10:58] if that thing is not there.
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:04] So when you are hearing the prophet said
[1:11:08] marry a believer go beyond that marry a
[1:11:12] believer that you love.
[1:11:16] Don't marry a believer you does not
[1:11:17] love.
[1:11:19] Because there will be problem.
[1:11:24] 10 women will be here.
[1:11:26] 10 women. There is one that you have
[1:11:30] attraction to.
[1:11:33] Who the attraction
[1:11:35] bond
[1:11:37] that is the affection? What is the
[1:11:40] affection? Is love.
[1:11:44] And that is why when that is there, you
[1:11:48] will not like to mreat her
[1:11:52] because when you mreat her, you will be
[1:11:54] feeling it.
[1:11:57] When she's feeling pain, you'll be
[1:12:00] feeling it because she's part of you.
[1:12:08] It is the same thing with Christ.
[1:12:13] This is why when the word of God came to
[1:12:15] us in the way of the reveal word though
[1:12:19] it was criticized
[1:12:21] we saw it and we accepted it because
[1:12:25] there was something
[1:12:27] brought to it.
[1:12:29] This is love. We love him because he's
[1:12:32] the one that fought for love us.
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:39] Therefore, because we love him, we
[1:12:42] surrender to him.
[1:12:46] We accepted him.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; It is love that make you accept the
[1:12:51] message
[1:12:53] because the message is criticized
[1:12:56] is despised,
[1:12:58] is rejected, but still you receive it.
[1:13:03] Love
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; is because you are part of it. is part
[1:13:08] of you. There's something that comes
[1:13:12] and you embrace it.
[1:13:15] The more he correct you, the more you
[1:13:18] love him
[1:13:20] because love is corrective.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; God said,
[1:13:25] I rebuke and chasing those that I love.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; This is love and that is why The more he
[1:13:38] corrects you,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; the more you follow him
[1:13:45] because you know
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; is love
[1:13:50] that's what makes it correct you.
[1:13:54] I used to tell people if you are a Bible
[1:13:57] reader
[1:13:59] when Jesus want to choose 12 disciple
[1:14:03] he went to the mountain he prayed all
[1:14:06] night.
[1:14:08] When Jesus came down from the mountain,
[1:14:11] he choose 12 disciples.
[1:14:14] He called them apostles.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Out of the 12 disciple choose,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Judas was there.
[1:14:25] Judas was there. I want to show you what
[1:14:27] love is. I want
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; I want to show you what love is.
[1:14:33] There is no way
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus ever rebuked Judas.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Nowhere.
[1:14:46] But Peter
[1:14:48] Jesus look at him say, "Get behind me."
[1:14:54] Jesus was constantly calling Peter Satan
[1:15:00] until when Jesus said one person will
[1:15:03] betray him. Everybody was looking at
[1:15:05] Peter
[1:15:09] because they know that Peter is the
[1:15:12] Satan they always rebuke.
[1:15:16] Nobody suspect Judas
[1:15:19] because Jesus never corrected him.
[1:15:22] He cannot rebuke it because Bible says I
[1:15:26] rebuke those that are here
[1:15:29] and the love of God is love because God
[1:15:33] loves you. Because you love you to
[1:15:39] God love you, he will not choose to.
[1:15:44] So the love of God is election.
[1:15:47] He created you and choose you for
[1:15:50] salvation.
[1:15:52] only one time.
[1:15:55] Do you know that it was Judas
[1:15:58] when Mary went to buy the alabaster oil
[1:16:05] the leper?
[1:16:08] When he came to pour the alabaster oil
[1:16:10] on Jesus body,
[1:16:14] Judah was hungry.
[1:16:17] He was annoyed
[1:16:20] until he did not stop it. He told Jesus,
[1:16:24] he said, "Why this waste? Why this?
[1:16:29] Why this waste?
[1:16:32] This oil would have been sold
[1:16:36] and we will give the money to the poor."
[1:16:40] Judah was advising Jesus.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; He was advising Jesus.
[1:16:46] This is a waste
[1:16:50] oil very expensive. It would have been
[1:16:53] sold and we will give the money to the
[1:16:55] poor
[1:16:57] and they wasting it on you.
[1:17:00] Jesus look at Judah.
[1:17:02] He said friend you have the poor always.
[1:17:08] He said but me they don't have always.
[1:17:11] This thing this woman
[1:17:13] is for my bail.
[1:17:16] Any time this gospel is preached,
[1:17:19] it will be said about her as a memorial.
[1:17:23] He did not rebuke Judas. He didn't
[1:17:25] rebuke him. He said, "Friend,
[1:17:30] that thing that Judas said to Jesus
[1:17:34] is not up to what Peter used to say.
[1:17:44] What did Jesus say? What did Peter say?
[1:17:47] When Jesus said they are coming to take
[1:17:50] me, Peter shall not allow them
[1:17:54] over my dead body. I will die with you
[1:17:57] anything then Jesus say
[1:18:02] somebody that try to protect you, you
[1:18:03] are coming
[1:18:06] because you didn't ser the things of
[1:18:08] God.
[1:18:09] You suffer the men
[1:18:13] get behind me.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Judas
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; was complaining
[1:18:20] that was poured upon Jesus. It was not
[1:18:22] the one that brought the oil. It was not
[1:18:25] his money. Somebody just came and give
[1:18:27] Jesus
[1:18:29] and he call it a waste
[1:18:32] and Jesus did not rebuke him.
[1:18:35] So when you come to church or you do
[1:18:38] anything wrong and God did not talk to
[1:18:40] you, you are in a terrible condition.
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:48] You are in a terrible condition
[1:18:50] because God, he always talk to this one
[1:18:53] that he love
[1:18:55] because he's rebuking you. He's chasing
[1:18:57] you so that you can be partaker of his
[1:18:59] holiness.
[1:19:03] He rebuke is not punishment. It's
[1:19:06] chastisement. It is for you to be
[1:19:08] partaker of his holy name. He wants you
[1:19:11] to look at him.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't rebuke Judas.
[1:19:18] That was why when he told them, "One of
[1:19:21] you will betray me." Everybody Judas,
[1:19:25] you were looking at Peter.
[1:19:28] It was Peter Peter. When everybody was
[1:19:31] on him,
[1:19:34] he not I love Jesus.
[1:19:39] He asked John, John,
[1:19:41] as Jesus, who is the one?
[1:19:46] John said, "Master,
[1:19:48] who is the one?" He said, "The one that
[1:19:50] will dip the hand with me.
[1:19:53] When I dip my hand, do you know that the
[1:19:56] moment Jesus deep his hand,
[1:20:00] Judah deep his hand,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; he was so trusted
[1:20:04] that nobody think he's the one.
[1:20:10] He was he has never rebuked him.
[1:20:14] deep
[1:20:16] not be Judas
[1:20:23] Judas.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Then he look at it he say friend what
[1:20:27] you do do quickly
[1:20:32] because he's always calling him friend.
[1:20:34] Judas was the only person Jesus called
[1:20:37] friend.
[1:20:41] Then you begin to wonder why was Jesus
[1:20:43] calling him free?
[1:20:47] Because to begin with is a son of
[1:20:50] addition
[1:20:52] and he's a son of pity.
[1:20:55] There is nothing you can do to save him.
[1:21:00] He come from hell. He must go back to
[1:21:04] hell. Jesus know this.
[1:21:07] All what he had for him was
[1:21:10] encouragement.
[1:21:13] It is the same thing. It's the same
[1:21:16] thing when you have this understanding.
[1:21:19] When you see people outside,
[1:21:21] you will not be treating them bad
[1:21:24] because you know they are object of
[1:21:25] pity.
[1:21:28] You will see men inside big big jeep.
[1:21:32] They enjoying the pleasures of the
[1:21:34] world. where you have contact with the
[1:21:36] heavenly
[1:21:39] when you see them you beating them.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; But that's not the case. Many of us when
[1:21:48] we look at them we want to be copying
[1:21:50] them.
[1:21:52] It's because you lack understanding.
[1:21:56] They are object of pity.
[1:21:59] And that's what many of
[1:22:02] the simple life you are living. They
[1:22:05] cannot live it.
[1:22:07] They can't no way they can do it.
[1:22:12] And that's why nothing to envy in them.
[1:22:16] They object of pity.
[1:22:21] The only hope they have
[1:22:24] is on this earth.
[1:22:27] They live like animals.
[1:22:29] They die like animals.
[1:22:32] And when they die, the Bible say death
[1:22:34] will feed on them
[1:22:37] feed on them.
[1:22:39] But your case and my case is not like
[1:22:42] that.
[1:22:45] In us, we have a deposit of internal
[1:22:48] life.
[1:22:51] A life that does not have a beginning
[1:22:54] and cannot end.
[1:22:57] This is what the grace of God gave to
[1:23:00] us. That's our salvation.
[1:23:04] And that is what says if on this earth
[1:23:07] alone
[1:23:09] we have hope
[1:23:11] for all men most miserable.
[1:23:14] But we have hope here.
[1:23:17] We have hope in glory.
[1:23:19] Christ
[1:23:21] glory.
[1:23:25] And that's why when our time here is
[1:23:28] about to finish,
[1:23:31] when our time is about to finish,
[1:23:34] then God send our theophony
[1:23:39] to carry us away to his presence. And
[1:23:43] while you are here living, he need to
[1:23:47] feed on the world
[1:23:49] with peace, with joy, with
[1:23:52] righteousness.
[1:23:54] happiness, but then they don't have it.
[1:23:58] And that is why many of them it used to
[1:24:02] be very difficult for them to release
[1:24:04] money for you
[1:24:07] because they know what they went through
[1:24:10] and you are just you are just enjoying
[1:24:12] your life. People
[1:24:15] want to partake of sweat that I went
[1:24:17] through.
[1:24:19] Even when you have a brother
[1:24:22] who is in that category, he will hardly
[1:24:25] be giving you money,
[1:24:30] he just give you
[1:24:34] because when he look, no peace, no joy,
[1:24:38] no happiness. The only thing is this
[1:24:40] money.
[1:24:42] So what am I bringing? They can acquire
[1:24:45] everything under heaven.
[1:24:49] Because the Bible says money answer all
[1:24:52] things
[1:24:55] but they cannot acquire peace.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Money cannot give you peace
[1:25:02] because peace is not on earth heaven.
[1:25:08] So as money can acquire things under
[1:25:12] this economy that is how faith can
[1:25:15] acquire things economy
[1:25:21] faith is stronger than money.
[1:25:26] Money cannot give you faith.
[1:25:28] Faith can give you money.
[1:25:33] This is why I say faith is your ticket
[1:25:35] to all victory.
[1:25:38] All this promise in the Bible, it
[1:25:41] belongs to a Christian.
[1:25:44] And that is why the only way you can
[1:25:45] accept the promise is by faith
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] and faith come by hearing
[1:25:54] hearing by the word of the Lord.
[1:25:57] This is why you see Pentecost
[1:26:01] they have too many words.
[1:26:04] Do you know why?
[1:26:07] Every promise in the Bible
[1:26:10] that has to bring about materialism,
[1:26:13] they search it
[1:26:16] because Jesus said the scripture for him
[1:26:20] there you think you have eternal life.
[1:26:25] The pentecost when they look at the
[1:26:27] Bible all what they want to see is what
[1:26:30] can give them physically.
[1:26:33] God said, God said, God said, and they
[1:26:37] are getting it, God said.
[1:26:41] Anything God said, when you have faith
[1:26:44] in it, you will get it.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Because faith is our ticket
[1:26:53] to the victory of good life.
[1:26:57] If you want to live a good life,
[1:27:00] a happy life, use your faith.
[1:27:05] The promise is already there.
[1:27:08] God can't bring you second time. What
[1:27:10] can make you receive it
[1:27:13] is faith.
[1:27:16] There is nothing you cannot get
[1:27:20] if you have faith.
[1:27:22] In fact, there is no miracle
[1:27:26] that faith cannot do.
[1:27:28] The Bible say through faith
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; you can quench every fid of the wicked.
[1:27:36] Through faith you can move mountain.
[1:27:40] So when you see
[1:27:43] what making them to stand tall
[1:27:46] and have faith in what God promised
[1:27:50] to today
[1:27:54] if there's a church under heaven that
[1:27:57] have faith
[1:28:00] said they have a living faith
[1:28:04] and this is what you and me need.
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:09] You and me need it.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; This is what you and me need
[1:28:16] to live a better life.
[1:28:19] This is what you and me need
[1:28:22] to live a well life.
[1:28:24] This is what you and me need
[1:28:27] to make the rapture
[1:28:29] because without faith you can make
[1:28:32] rapture
[1:28:36] and that's why brother said in message
[1:28:42] I want you to get built up
[1:28:45] in this holy oracle
[1:28:50] the faith of this hour
[1:28:53] of the hour
[1:28:54] All that you have seen, all that you
[1:28:56] have heard, accumulate them and build
[1:29:00] because we are going to need more faith.
[1:29:04] Only faith has ever happened that heaven
[1:29:06] to make the rapture. So to make the
[1:29:08] rapture is by faith.
[1:29:12] Salvation is by faith. Healing is by
[1:29:17] faith. When you want physical,
[1:29:21] you want by faith. That is the way God
[1:29:24] has placed.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And that is why brothers
[1:29:32] when you go to the book of
[1:29:35] Revelation chapter 13
[1:29:38] verse 8.
[1:29:42] He said all will be deceived.
[1:29:47] All will be deceived
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; except those that have their name in the
[1:29:51] land.
[1:29:55] They want to ask you a question. How do
[1:29:58] you know your name is in the last book
[1:29:59] of life?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; How do you know?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; How do you know?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; It's by faith.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; It's by faith.
[1:30:14] Because when you open the Bible,
[1:30:19] brother, your name is Jeremiah.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Are you not Jeremiah?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I'm Jeremiah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; When the Bible opened, he say if I say
[1:30:27] the book of Jeremiah,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you.
[1:30:34] is Jeremiah.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; But if I say the book of Jeremiah,
[1:30:38] I'm not talking about him
[1:30:41] because we know there is there was one
[1:30:44] Jeremiah.
[1:30:46] Do you know why I know it's not
[1:30:48] Jeremiah?
[1:30:49] Because that Jeremiah was a prophet
[1:30:52] and he suffer.
[1:30:54] This one is not a prophet and he has not
[1:30:57] suffered.
[1:31:00] Have you suffered?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Did you suffer in the hand of King of
[1:31:07] Babylon? Do you know what Babylon is?
[1:31:10] [Laughter]
[1:31:12] But let me tell you something.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; But everything that is said about
[1:31:16] Jeremiah
[1:31:18] by faith you can claim it and you defer
[1:31:22] to him.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; And that is why will you see any
[1:31:27] character in the Bible
[1:31:29] that you love. Remove that character and
[1:31:31] put your name.
[1:31:34] When you put your name, the thing you
[1:31:36] desire about that character will come to
[1:31:39] you.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; That's what that will confess.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; So when we are talking about healing,
[1:31:48] the Bible says by his stripes
[1:31:53] you is not a person's name.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; You carry your name.
[1:31:58] push them. You say judge by his strip is
[1:32:02] healed and say God thank you.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; You have collected it and because you
[1:32:09] collect it and you believe it, God give
[1:32:12] it to you. What give it to you.
[1:32:17] So every promise in the book belongs to
[1:32:20] you. If only you can believe.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; This is what faith does.
[1:32:27] Faith is your ticket
[1:32:31] to enjoy every blessing
[1:32:34] because this blessing
[1:32:38] Jesus has paid for every one of us.
[1:32:41] He has paid he has released it. The only
[1:32:43] way you can assess it is by faith.
[1:32:48] And that's why I don't care how Satan is
[1:32:50] troubling you. How Satan is troubling
[1:32:53] you in the way of sin. Tell him no,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; I am saved.
[1:33:01] Tell Satan I am saved because by his
[1:33:04] stripe I was healed. He was wounded for
[1:33:07] my transgression.
[1:33:10] If you like carry me to a prostitute
[1:33:13] house,
[1:33:15] if you like, carry me to a prostitute
[1:33:17] house.
[1:33:19] Take me to sleep with the prostitute.
[1:33:24] When Satan know
[1:33:26] You know what you are talking about, he
[1:33:29] will leave you.
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:32] Every man that can hold to God's promise
[1:33:37] are a bad market to Satan.
[1:33:41] Bad market
[1:33:44] a
[1:33:47] Satan don't deal with bad markets.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; He don't deal with bad markets.
[1:33:54] Every true believer in God is a bad
[1:33:57] market to Satan.
[1:33:59] He will leave you.
[1:34:06] This is the problem.
[1:34:09] What God wants.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Take me by my ways.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I have given it to you.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And will you take it? Don't look at any
[1:34:24] other thing. Set your eye on the
[1:34:26] promise.
[1:34:29] You will enter into the victory.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; This message of the hour
[1:34:38] by faith you have accepted it. I want to
[1:34:41] say it as I'm standing here.
[1:34:44] If everybody backslide,
[1:34:47] if everybody bus
[1:34:52] me I cannot lead.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; This is why I sang that song just now.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus is only is the only friend I have.
[1:35:03] All my heart is for him. So where will I
[1:35:07] go?
[1:35:08] To whom will I go? I believe and I am
[1:35:12] sure this is eternal life.
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And that is the way God want you to
[1:35:20] believe.
[1:35:21] When you are coming to God, you should
[1:35:23] not have eternity.
[1:35:26] When you have eternality,
[1:35:28] you are not believed.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You have not believed. A man that
[1:35:34] believe God does not have alternative.
[1:35:37] God is the only alternative.
[1:35:41] When you go to God like that,
[1:35:44] you can never go the way you are.
[1:35:46] He will go with testimony
[1:35:49] because the Bible says as many that put
[1:35:52] their trust in him shall never be put to
[1:35:55] shame.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; God is looking for people that he will
[1:36:00] use to prove his word
[1:36:02] and he can only use a believer to prove
[1:36:05] his word. Brother
[1:36:08] now God raised dead.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; There is no sickness.
[1:36:16] He has paid for it.
[1:36:18] All you need to do only believe.
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Is it money?
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Is it material?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Is it financial
[1:36:29] faith will open you for you
[1:36:35] is looking for men who will take it by
[1:36:37] his word. They will see God.
[1:36:41] God is a man of action.
[1:36:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Action when you have come to God believe
[1:36:50] is finished.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; as we are calling prayer line this
[1:36:55] evening
[1:36:56] you that will stay in the prayer line.
[1:36:59] Don't go to prayer line to test.
[1:37:03] Go to prayer to receive.
[1:37:06] It's not a test.
[1:37:08] It's not a test. This is a place of
[1:37:11] receiving
[1:37:12] as that come to him. He will know why
[1:37:15] cast them out. He will grant the heart.
[1:37:21] So when you are coming, I'm coming to
[1:37:23] receive. That is the purpose because he
[1:37:26] have it to give to you. In fact, he has
[1:37:29] given it to you. You are only coming to
[1:37:31] receive what belong to you,
[1:37:33] healing, deliverance, blessing is the
[1:37:37] children's bread.
[1:37:39] God has paid for it at Calvary. That's
[1:37:43] why Jesus said it is finished. So when
[1:37:45] you have needs, you come to him. Father,
[1:37:49] you said
[1:37:51] you said you said and when God check
[1:37:55] what he said,
[1:37:57] he confirm it.
[1:38:00] He's there confirming what he said.
[1:38:06] I'm closing with this. I was hearing the
[1:38:08] pastor now. I was hearing the pastor.
[1:38:12] He was talking about some bed that used
[1:38:14] to go to the prison to preach.
[1:38:16] Where are the here? Let me see your
[1:38:18] hand.
[1:38:19] People that go to prison to preach. God
[1:38:22] bless you brother. Any other one?
[1:38:27] I want to give you one testimony.
[1:38:31] I have a prison ministry.
[1:38:37] When I enter the prison to be preaching
[1:38:40] to them, I told them all the inmates,
[1:38:45] I said, "Anybody here
[1:38:48] that will believe what I brought to this
[1:38:50] prison,
[1:38:52] I brought deliverance.
[1:38:54] The day you will believe what I'm
[1:38:56] preaching,
[1:38:58] you will not sleep in this prison.
[1:39:01] That day, you'll be free."
[1:39:04] Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I say you have been receiving pastors
[1:39:12] here.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; You have been receiving pastors here.
[1:39:17] The message I brought is not like other
[1:39:20] pastor's message.
[1:39:24] Jesus came to set the captives free.
[1:39:29] So when you are here, you believe what I
[1:39:32] bring. Not a make believe
[1:39:36] from your heart. You will not sleep in
[1:39:38] this prison.
[1:39:41] Now listen.
[1:39:46] Then that's how it started.
[1:39:49] And they gave me a nickname.
[1:39:52] They call me pastor. Amen. And amen.
[1:39:58] So when I come, they say pastor. Amen.
[1:40:00] And amen.
[1:40:04] I say amen is the finish point of the
[1:40:09] when you believe and amen
[1:40:13] your time in prison finish.
[1:40:16] Now listen then what started
[1:40:19] he was a Muslim
[1:40:22] when I threw that challenge
[1:40:25] when I threw the challenge
[1:40:27] then he open his heart.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; This is the Bible before me. I lay my
[1:40:32] hand on it. The day that boy surrendered
[1:40:37] to the message,
[1:40:39] he was free from the prison.
[1:40:42] Now listen, sir, now listen.
[1:40:45] I was at home. A number called me.
[1:40:49] I said this, I don't know him. He said,
[1:40:52] "Pastor from prison."
[1:40:56] He mention his name. There are many I
[1:40:58] don't know their name. He said, "I want
[1:40:59] to see you.
[1:41:01] Then I made myself available.
[1:41:04] I make myself available to him. Then he
[1:41:07] came to me. He said I come to you now
[1:41:11] because you said anybody that believe
[1:41:14] what you preach in the prison we not
[1:41:17] sleep in the prison. He said when I
[1:41:19] believe
[1:41:21] he said I that was the week I left the
[1:41:22] prison. That's what I'm looking for you.
[1:41:26] He said what is the next thing?
[1:41:30] He said, "What is the next thing?"
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:37] I said, "You need to repent and be
[1:41:39] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:41:43] the remission of your sins that receive
[1:41:44] the power of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[1:41:47] "I want to baptize.
[1:41:50] I took him to water.
[1:41:53] I baptized him.
[1:41:55] When I baptized him, I was expecting to
[1:41:58] go. You see, I'm not going anywhere.
[1:42:00] I'll be stay with you.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; You'll be stay with me. Why? He said
[1:42:12] there's no place I can stay
[1:42:16] because I have never seen this kind
[1:42:17] before.
[1:42:21] He said I will be with you.
[1:42:27] Go.
[1:42:28] I go to church said I'm not going
[1:42:35] to discourage him.
[1:42:38] He said he said he said because my life
[1:42:40] is scattered.
[1:42:42] You are the one to arrange the life for
[1:42:44] me.
[1:42:47] Arrange your life. I don't have work to
[1:42:48] give you and you don't have a cut to the
[1:42:50] ministry. Then I can say okay I will
[1:42:53] betray you as
[1:42:56] then I took him. He was staying with me
[1:43:00] everywhere I'm going he be following me.
[1:43:03] He wash my car. He clean my things. He
[1:43:06] take up my house. Everything was
[1:43:08] following me. If I'm going for
[1:43:10] evangelism
[1:43:11] I will take him. Then he started
[1:43:13] dressing well. He dress the way I dress.
[1:43:17] He do the way I do things. He follow me.
[1:43:20] Then one day
[1:43:22] God opened my eyes in a vision of a
[1:43:25] night that he still have something he
[1:43:27] have to be delivered from. There is
[1:43:30] something blocking his way.
[1:43:32] He can't go forward. He can't go
[1:43:33] backward.
[1:43:36] When I wake up from that revelation
[1:43:39] his name was a Muslim boy. I was the one
[1:43:43] that call him Elijah
[1:43:45] because when I want to baptize him I
[1:43:47] said can I don't baptize you with this
[1:43:49] Muslim name.
[1:43:51] What is your name? He said I can't use
[1:43:54] to baptize you.
[1:43:56] He said I will give him name. I look at
[1:43:58] him.
[1:44:00] I say you are a legend from today. You
[1:44:03] are a liar. Say yes sir.
[1:44:07] I took it to.
[1:44:09] So when we I saw that vision about him,
[1:44:13] I took it to the church.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I lay my hand upon him.
[1:44:17] I said, "Lord, you brought this boy. You
[1:44:21] show me what is his problem. I lay my
[1:44:24] hand now. That obstacle that is on his
[1:44:26] way today, I condemn it and I b the
[1:44:33] lift and all the way will be open."
[1:44:37] This is the puppet. That day I did that
[1:44:40] deliverance for him.
[1:44:43] The next day they call him from his
[1:44:45] village. king that they are looking for
[1:44:49] help. They want to employ people
[1:44:52] and in their quarter in their quarter
[1:44:56] they want to employ people in road
[1:44:57] safety federal government job
[1:45:00] and in their quarters there is no
[1:45:02] candidate available. There's no
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; no candidate,
[1:45:06] no candidate. Then they remember that
[1:45:09] this man has left the prison but nobody
[1:45:11] know where he is.
[1:45:13] They say you should come and take the
[1:45:15] position. That same week
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; he went to take that position.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; The life open.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That life that doesn't have meaning
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; took meaning
[1:45:28] shape
[1:45:36] because when he came came out from
[1:45:39] prison
[1:45:40] any time I'm going back to prison I will
[1:45:43] carry him. So he was a living testimony.
[1:45:47] All of them know him.
[1:45:50] He come with to the prison with me.
[1:45:53] This is the one I want to bring to you.
[1:45:54] Now
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; then there was another inmate.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Another inmate
[1:46:04] that one
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; in our head
[1:46:09] saying his girlfriend.
[1:46:12] He said please look for the this
[1:46:15] pastor's
[1:46:16] go and meet him in his office.
[1:46:20] I want you to help me. The way he help
[1:46:22] Elijah.
[1:46:24] I was in the office. The guy just came.
[1:46:27] He said I want to see you pastor. I said
[1:46:29] from where? I've never seen you before.
[1:46:31] He said from prison prison. He says my
[1:46:33] boyfriend as me.
[1:46:36] I said what was it? He said he want you
[1:46:37] to help you. I said how? He said he want
[1:46:40] to leave the prison. If they look for a
[1:46:42] way to free they cannot free
[1:46:44] I said okay what will happen if I come
[1:46:46] to prison I will see him
[1:46:48] when I went to prison after finishing
[1:46:51] the day I was preaching they took him to
[1:46:54] court he was not around so when I
[1:46:56] finished that was when he was coming in
[1:47:00] they told that I just finished I'm going
[1:47:05] say pastor
[1:47:09] he said I want to see you please with
[1:47:11] chain on his leg and hand like
[1:47:14] I said what is it? He said I want to
[1:47:16] talk to you. He said please tell the
[1:47:18] water officer the welfare officer
[1:47:23] if I can come to his office that's my
[1:47:25] problem. I went to the welfare officer I
[1:47:28] said there's an office he want to see me
[1:47:30] personally he said he want to use at
[1:47:33] your office. He said no you want him. I
[1:47:37] said what? He said please. I see
[1:47:41] it. He was a very deadly inmate here.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; But
[1:47:49] you help him.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; You brought him out. Bring me out.
[1:47:56] I said bring you out. Am I a lawyer?
[1:47:59] Am I a judge? Am I a policeman? I can't
[1:48:03] bring you out.
[1:48:04] Either the law bring you out or go bring
[1:48:07] you out. Yes. Mhm.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; He said, but you help him. I say, you
[1:48:13] know what happened? I told you people in
[1:48:16] this prison.
[1:48:18] What I have brought to you is a message
[1:48:20] of deliverance. The day you believe it
[1:48:24] is between you and God. God know your
[1:48:27] heart. You will not sleep here.
[1:48:32] You will not sleep here.
[1:48:34] I say the same thing. When you believe,
[1:48:36] you will not sleep here.
[1:48:38] Then I left.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Then he went to the prison.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; What is what? He now begin to ask is
[1:48:46] anything that used to preach contract.
[1:48:48] They told him.
[1:48:52] He said God I believe.
[1:48:55] Anything pastor will say I believe.
[1:49:00] I believe Lord.
[1:49:02] I believe.
[1:49:06] I was at home.
[1:49:08] The word of God is so simple.
[1:49:14] He call me because when you see a
[1:49:16] prisoner call you
[1:49:18] is because he's free because they don't
[1:49:21] have access to telephone.
[1:49:23] So he call me he said pastor where are
[1:49:27] you? I want to see you.
[1:49:30] I said who are you? He I don't know
[1:49:33] their names. He said I'm the one that
[1:49:35] say you should help me.
[1:49:37] He said you have helped me that's why I
[1:49:39] want to see you.
[1:49:42] I made myself available.
[1:49:44] I s I said you should meet me in the
[1:49:46] office.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; He came with that girl.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Both of them came from my office. I look
[1:49:54] you said yes. He said pastor you know
