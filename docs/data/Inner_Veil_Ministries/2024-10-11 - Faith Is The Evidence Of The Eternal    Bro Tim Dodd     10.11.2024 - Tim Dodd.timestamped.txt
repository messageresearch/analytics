[29:20] yesterday we were

[29:31] us amen so uh on

[29:41] ministers
[29:44] there so I want you to keep remembering
[29:48] these men in
[29:50] prayer so that the Lord can give them
[29:54] boldness to speak the word amen amen
[29:59] Peter and the rest of the
[30:02] disciples received their Pentecost in
[30:04] the upper
[30:06] room but it was not enough for
[30:09] them for them to preach the
[30:12] gospel they were
[30:15] threatened until they went
[30:18] again and prayed that now that we have
[30:22] got the Holy
[30:23] Ghost give us the
[30:25] boldness to preach the word and now the
[30:29] Holy Spirit came
[30:30] down and shook the place where they
[30:34] were and I think and I
[30:37] believe that the Holy Ghost has shaken
[30:40] the grounds of these
[30:44] men so that's why they've got the
[30:48] ability to stand before those
[30:51] organizations and
[30:53] preach the gospel the boldness of Paul
[30:58] where he stood and said he was waiting
[31:01] for the
[31:02] de when God is going to judge the
[31:08] world his
[31:10] gospel amen so God bless you

[33:54] morning now
[33:56] Lord take us into the
[34:00] heavenlies open our
[34:04] understanding this morning you may have
[34:06] opened our
[34:09] eyes but now you may you open our
[34:14] understanding we ask Lord you to deal
[34:17] strongly in our
[34:22] lives that we might see the way you want
[34:25] us to see
[34:30] anoint the speaker and the
[34:35] hearer bless this church
[34:38] Lord may you anoint each and every seed
[34:41] of
[34:43] God to take a step higher
[34:47] today may we hear the voice of
[34:51] God saying come up
[34:55] higher we ask it for For Your
[34:59] Glory in Jesus Christ's
[35:03] [Applause]
[35:05] name amen while you're standing let's
[35:07] turn to the book of Hebrews chapter
[35:13] 11 and then we'll turn to 2 Corinthians
[35:15] chapter
[35:19] 4
[35:26] Amen brother James if there was some
[35:32] water Hebrews chapter
[35:35] 11 familiar
[35:38] scripture now as I read this
[35:42] scripture I want you to realize the age
[35:44] that you are called to live
[35:48] in Paul said when that which is perfect
[35:51] is
[35:53] come that which is in part shall be done
[35:56] away
[36:00] we've come to the hour of the perfect
[36:01] interpretation of the
[36:06] word we come to Revelation
[36:10] 107 in the days of the voice of the
[36:12] seventh
[36:14] angel all the mystery will be
[36:18] finished we are here
[36:20] now we're not looking for
[36:23] that that's the age we are
[36:26] in then if the perfect if the mystery is
[36:31] finished we have the perfect
[36:35] word if you have the perfect
[36:38] word it will bring you to perfect
[36:42] Faith so when we read about
[36:47] faith you have come to the hour of
[36:50] perfect
[36:53] faith not partial Faith anymore
[36:57] what we come to the fullness of God's
[37:00] Redemptive
[37:02] [Music]
[37:06] purpose amen all right Hebrews 11
[37:11] [Music]
[37:12] And1 now Faith is the substance of
[37:15] things hoped for the evidence of things
[37:18] not
[37:20] [Music]
[37:24] seen as we said this morning faith is in
[37:27] the Soul
[37:31] realm for by it the elders obtained a
[37:34] good
[37:40] report through faith we
[37:45] understand but stop just for a
[37:49] moment is telling us by
[37:52] faith we think different
[37:58] [Music]
[38:00] understanding is a mind
[38:06] exercise are you with
[38:08] me through faith we understand that the
[38:12] worlds were framed by the word of
[38:17] [Music]
[38:19] God so that things which are seen were
[38:22] not made of things which do appear
[38:31] amen you believe that 2 Corinthians
[38:36] [Music]
[38:45] 4 there's never been an hour where we
[38:48] are so close to our
[38:55] theophany just any moment
[38:58] this Mortal will take on
[39:02] immortality and and this corruptible
[39:05] will take on
[39:08] incorruption and we will Unite with our
[39:10] Heavenly
[39:13] Body and we will see what is now
[39:21] unseen all right now notice
[39:24] this 2 Corinthians 4:18
[39:30] while we look not at the things which
[39:32] are seen But at the things which are not
[39:35] seen the things which are seen are
[39:38] temporal or temporary but the things
[39:42] which are not seen are eternal
[39:46] [Music]
[39:56] [Music]
[39:58] now what did we read in
[40:01] Hebrews faith is the evidence of Things
[40:04] Not
[40:07] Seen but the Things Not Seen are
[40:12] Eternal so faith is the evidence of the
[40:21] Eternal the Lord add his Blessing to the
[40:23] word you may have
[40:28] through faith we
[40:31] understand through faith our minds have
[40:38] grasped that the things which are
[40:41] seen were not made of things which
[40:46] appear we did not learn this through
[40:51] education we didn't learn it from
[40:55] experience we learn it from
[40:59] church we didn't learn it from
[41:02] religion Faith tells us there's
[41:05] something behind the things that we
[41:10] see there's more to this life than what
[41:13] we
[41:16] see are you with
[41:18] me you believe
[41:21] that let me tell you if you want to know
[41:23] what the science says
[41:27] now they use a term called Dark Matter
[41:31] and dark
[41:34] energy Dark Matter like
[41:40] substance you could say black if you
[41:42] want or dark
[41:45] okay and and dark
[41:48] [Music]
[41:50] energy don't worry if you don't
[41:55] understand but but they they say that
[41:57] 95% of the universe is made up of dark
[42:01] matter and dark
[42:04] [Music]
[42:10] energy and this is what science
[42:13] says don't worry there won't be a test
[42:15] at the end
[42:19] of they say everything scientists can
[42:22] observe in the universe
[42:28] from
[42:29] people to
[42:31] planets to Stars
[42:36] planet is made of
[42:40] matter the definition of
[42:45] matter is any substance that has weight
[42:48] to
[42:48] [Music]
[42:50] it and occupies
[42:55] space but there's more to the universe
[42:58] than we can
[43:02] see dark matter and dark energy are
[43:05] mysterious
[43:10] substances that affect and shape The
[43:15] Universe And scientists are trying to
[43:18] figure it
[43:20] out they
[43:22] know by how it influences what they can
[43:25] see
[43:31] that 95% of the universe is dark matter
[43:34] and dark
[43:38] energy now let me put it into simple
[43:42] terms there's something out
[43:45] there they cannot
[43:48] see and they don't have any idea what it
[43:53] is that's science science but it
[43:56] constitutes
[43:57] 95% listen
[44:01] now of the influence in the scene
[44:09] realm 95% of the influence in your life
[44:13] is not in this dimension
[44:17] [Music]
[44:33] so science
[44:35] recognizes there's another
[44:38] dimension a dimension of
[44:43] substance brother brandham says that
[44:45] Dimension is more real than this
[44:55] Dimension science says if if you add up
[44:57] all the power in what we can
[45:03] see it doesn't even come close to the
[45:06] power that's from that
[45:12] dimension in other
[45:14] words what they see taste feel smell and
[45:22] hear is only
[45:25] 5% but there's a six
[45:29] sense by faith we
[45:35] understand by faith we are brought into
[45:38] the realities of a Heavenly
[45:45] Dimension now science can see an
[45:50] influence the universe is held in place
[45:53] by the word of God
[45:58] but in the midst of all
[46:01] that
[46:02] 95% of the influence is
[46:09] unseen so let me say what Paul
[46:13] said the things that are unseen are the
[46:15] things that are
[46:20] Eternal but faith is the evidence of the
[46:23] Eternal
[46:25] [Music]
[46:28] the message countdown
[46:32] 1962 Brown said happenings on the
[46:37] Earth are representing something that
[46:39] comes from somewhere
[46:44] else when it strikes the
[46:47] Earth it's usually in a perverted
[46:50] [Music]
[46:52] condition because the world is in
[46:54] darkness and sin
[46:59] but then there is a true
[47:03] representation in the spiritual
[47:07] Realms of the other
[47:11] dimension from being in these three
[47:15] dimensions then the sixth Dimension has
[47:18] its
[47:23] representation now I'm not talking about
[47:25] Dimensions tonight
[47:29] I'm talking about faith tapping into the
[47:36] Eternal can you say Amen to that you see
[47:40] your faith that God has dropped in your
[47:44] heart has more potentials than we
[47:50] realize we have to understand what God
[47:53] has given us sorry we have to understand
[47:56] what God has
[48:00] Jesus came to the on the road to
[48:04] emus and walked with the
[48:07] disciples they didn't know who he
[48:09] was what manner of communication is this
[48:12] as you walk
[48:15] together and they said who are
[48:17] you don't you know what's happened in
[48:20] jerusem how Jesus of Nazareth has been
[48:24] crucified we thought he was the Messiah
[48:27] now they're talking to
[48:30] him but their eyes are
[48:34] holding and that Jesus begins at the at
[48:37] Moses and all the
[48:41] prophets explaining the scriptures
[48:43] concerning
[48:46] himself what is he
[48:49] doing what is he
[48:51] doing he's sewing the
[48:54] word how does faith come
[48:58] by hearing the
[48:59] word he's sewing faith in
[49:03] them that they could know what's
[49:05] happening in their
[49:08] day and they they walk along the
[49:11] road and as they get to
[49:15] emus they
[49:17] stop and Jesus made as though he would
[49:20] have continued
[49:24] on and instead they say no no come in
[49:27] and join
[49:29] us and then Jesus
[49:32] yes he declares himself to
[49:38] them not in words
[49:41] now he already sold the
[49:45] word now he SWS something
[49:48] else his
[49:50] works and he begins to break
[49:53] bread and then they recognize him
[49:58] and he disappears out of
[50:02] the now later on in the same
[50:07] chapter Jesus appears to the disciples
[50:11] again and as he appears to the
[50:15] disciples the Bible said doesn't say he
[50:18] opens their
[50:20] eyes but now it says he opens their
[50:23] understanding
[50:27] now he's moved from the flesh realm to
[50:29] the spirit
[50:33] realm Hallelujah listen if God
[50:36] manifested himself
[50:39] here if we saw a
[50:43] miracle you would say that's
[50:46] God I saw it with my own
[50:49] eyes come on will you believe in
[50:53] miracles we believe in miracles
[50:57] but that's just God showing himself to
[51:00] your five
[51:01] [Music]
[51:05] senses how much greater is it when he
[51:07] opens our
[51:13] understanding
[51:24] amen you see faith
[51:27] moves in The Believer does what faith
[51:31] that moves in the
[51:34] believer real
[51:36] faith is from the
[51:40] Eternal you believe
[51:45] that didn't Jesus say that to
[51:49] Peter when he said Thou Art the Christ
[51:51] the son of the Living
[51:54] God said blessed art thou Simon
[51:59] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[52:02] this to
[52:02] [Music]
[52:05] you you didn't get this from what you
[52:07] see taste feel smell or
[52:14] hear you didn't get it from
[52:18] me you didn't get it from your
[52:21] flesh you didn't get it from some
[52:25] education My Father which is in
[52:30] heaven has revealed this unto
[52:34] you and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[52:38] against
[52:41] it
[52:43] Hallelujah Jesus opened their
[52:47] eyes open their
[52:49] understanding and then he said Terry in
[52:53] Jerusalem and this will be quickened in
[52:55] your soul
[53:00] huh amen amen I'm not sure why this is
[53:03] flashing in the background but it's sure
[53:07] distracting take that down I'll tell
[53:09] I'll tell you when to go to a scripture
[53:11] don't try and follow
[53:13] me everybody's eyes are going this
[53:18] direction
[53:19] amen all
[53:22] right so the spirit realm is where faith
[53:25] is enacted
[53:31] Faith doesn't look at reasoning
[53:33] imagination and so
[53:37] [Music]
[53:39] forth faith is anchored in the
[53:44] [Music]
[53:47] Eternal amen when God said to
[53:52] Abraham you see in God's terms
[53:58] faith and the
[54:01] Eternal is not subject to
[54:05] time but faith is
[54:10] eternal and faith cannot be
[54:15] stopped so God says to
[54:18] Abraham you're going to have a son
[54:21] you'll be the father of
[54:22] Nations and Abraham walked in faith
[54:28] getting stronger every
[54:30] day now in this
[54:33] Dimension he was getting weaker every
[54:38] day is that
[54:40] right he was getting
[54:42] older but his faith grew
[54:46] stronger
[54:48] stronger because it was
[54:52] eternal but now because it was eternal
[54:58] it was not subject to
[55:00] time one year five years 10 years 25
[55:06] years it didn't matter how
[55:09] long faith is the evidence of the
[55:17] Eternal and Abraham grew strong in that
[55:23] Faith even while he grew weaker in his
[55:26] body
[55:28] [Music]
[55:29] now I'm going to show you this brother
[55:32] Bram in the early part of his
[55:36] ministry God was teaching
[55:38] him how to respond to a
[55:43] vision and he showed him a vision of a
[55:46] baby that was
[55:49] sick and that the baby would be
[55:53] healed and he saw in this
[55:57] room a blondhair young
[56:02] man he saw an old woman in a
[56:11] chair maybe you don't have a word for
[56:13] blonde hair in Africa I've got it you
[56:15] got it
[56:18] okay and then I was an old woman sitting
[56:21] in a chair
[56:26] wiping her
[56:30] glasses there was a hat in a certain
[56:35] place why did God show him these
[56:40] things what is the
[56:42] vision it's a
[56:44] prophecy what is a
[56:47] prophecy it's the Eternal thoughts of
[56:49] God not yet materialized
[56:52] [Music]
[56:57] now God was training his
[56:59] [Music]
[57:01] Prophet so he got he got called to this
[57:06] house and he walks
[57:08] in and he sees the furniture just like
[57:11] div
[57:14] Vision he sees the blond haired
[57:17] [Music]
[57:19] boy who was actually traveling with
[57:22] him he saw the
[57:24] baby and he recognized it as the place
[57:27] where the vision took
[57:32] place he's like oh Now's the
[57:39] Time but he got ahead of the
[57:45] time but he said bring the
[57:48] baby and see if God doesn't heal the
[57:51] baby and he prayed for the
[57:54] baby and it got wor
[57:57] [Music]
[58:00] why he didn't pay close attention to the
[58:06] vision you see the Eternal is nothing to
[58:09] do with
[58:14] time in the Eternal things have to be in
[58:17] their
[58:22] place it's not us trying to produce
[58:25] something
[58:30] many times we think the
[58:32] Rapture we're in the time of the
[58:35] Rapture and the year 2000 comes
[58:39] around it's the end of the
[58:43] century 6,000 years of
[58:47] humanity it should be
[58:49] over preachers are preaching now is the
[58:52] time now the
[58:54] time and still here 24
[59:00] years why it's not a
[59:07] time it's not a day or an
[59:10] hour everything in the mind of God must
[59:13] be in
[59:17] [Music]
[59:19] place now let's go back to brother
[59:21] brandham in that
[59:24] room the baby got worse
[59:27] and he thought what have I done then he
[59:31] remembered oh that hat is supposed to be
[59:33] on this
[59:37] shelf and there was an old
[59:40] woman she's supposed to be sitting in
[59:42] that
[59:44] chair oh he thought I've really messed
[59:47] it
[59:49] up and the only thing he could
[59:54] do not fast
[59:57] not
[59:58] pray not
[1:00:00] worry
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:05] wait wait
[1:00:09] believing that the vision is of
[1:00:14] god you see brother brandham was being
[1:00:17] taught a
[1:00:20] lesson the Eternal is not subject to
[1:00:24] time
[1:00:29] in the Eternal there are things that
[1:00:32] need to be in their
[1:00:40] place you know one thing that God never
[1:00:42] showed brother brandom in that
[1:00:47] Vision what time was on the
[1:00:54] clock think about
[1:00:57] that God never showed him what time the
[1:01:02] vision God just said when you see this
[1:01:05] and see this and see this and see
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:10] this you'll know it's the
[1:01:12] time isn't that the disciples coming to
[1:01:17] Jesus when shall these things be what is
[1:01:20] the sign of your
[1:01:22] coming and of the end of the
[1:01:24] world and Jesus says when you see this
[1:01:28] and see this and see this and see this
[1:01:32] you'll know that the end is
[1:01:34] now at
[1:01:38] the he didn't say
[1:01:44] 2027 on the Gregorian
[1:01:48] calendar June the 3M
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:56] that's not what God
[1:01:59] Said for these things need to be in
[1:02:04] place that's how the Eternal
[1:02:12] works by
[1:02:14] faith we understand the
[1:02:19] Eternal Elijah came to Mount
[1:02:24] Carmel and he says
[1:02:26] now the one God that answers by fire let
[1:02:29] him be
[1:02:31] God why he had seen a
[1:02:35] vision and in the vision he had been
[1:02:37] shown the
[1:02:39] keys the keys the the
[1:02:46] answers he knew what was the right
[1:02:51] season he didn't know exactly
[1:02:56] it would be evening
[1:02:58] time the Bible says it shall be light in
[1:03:01] the evening
[1:03:04] time you are living in the evening
[1:03:08] time light is available to
[1:03:12] you not because you want
[1:03:14] it but because God said it would be
[1:03:19] here it's a thought of God for this
[1:03:24] age and so the prophets of Baal took up
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:29] challenge and what did they do they
[1:03:32] begin to
[1:03:34] dance they begin to get
[1:03:37] emotional they begin to cut
[1:03:40] themselves they begin to cry out cry out
[1:03:43] on
[1:03:44] baale oh ba send us the fire send us the
[1:03:49] fire we believe in you our lives are
[1:03:54] yours oh work themselves all
[1:03:59] day and there was
[1:04:04] Elijah maybe your God is
[1:04:10] tired not an ounce of worry in God's
[1:04:16] Prophet Faith had showed him the
[1:04:21] Eternal it wasn't time
[1:04:23] yet he was waiting for everything to
[1:04:26] come into
[1:04:29] place he said maybe your God's
[1:04:34] busy in this age we call that a troll I
[1:04:38] don't know if you have a word for that
[1:04:39] in Africa an Internet troll making fun
[1:04:42] of
[1:04:48] people oh maybe your God is
[1:04:53] deaf he wasn't scared of the
[1:04:57] prop he had seen himself offering the
[1:05:00] evening
[1:05:05] sacrifice and he knew his
[1:05:08] position he knew where he
[1:05:11] stood for the anointing is not
[1:05:17] emotions it's supreme power in
[1:05:23] control knowing
[1:05:27] understanding exactly what and
[1:05:33] how and so the evening time
[1:05:36] came and he rebuilt the altar of
[1:05:40] Israel 12
[1:05:43] Stones and he built up the
[1:05:45] altar restored the
[1:05:48] altar biger trench around
[1:05:52] the and he put the sacrifice on the alt
[1:05:58] now get some
[1:05:59] water pour it on the
[1:06:02] sacrifice and they poured a little on no
[1:06:05] no no keep
[1:06:07] pouring because I saw in the vision that
[1:06:09] trench needs to be full
[1:06:17] Hallelujah keep pouring it wasn't
[1:06:20] Elijah's
[1:06:22] intelligence it was the intelligence of
[1:06:25] Heaven
[1:06:27] and Elijah stood
[1:06:29] there did he get
[1:06:31] excited no Jesus said the spirit of the
[1:06:35] Lord is upon
[1:06:38] me and has sent me to set the captives
[1:06:43] free preach
[1:06:46] Deliverance brother said the the
[1:06:48] mightiest anointing that was on a
[1:06:54] man luk
[1:06:56] 4 and he says if you that anointing was
[1:07:00] upon
[1:07:03] someone you Pentecostals would
[1:07:07] think that he would run all over the
[1:07:09] room and get
[1:07:12] excited but what did Jesus
[1:07:16] do he did what Elijah
[1:07:20] did he sat
[1:07:22] down and precious words proceeded
[1:07:28] from with the mightiest anointing that
[1:07:30] ever was
[1:07:34] upon now here was the anointing upon
[1:07:38] Elijah he said now great
[1:07:43] Jehovah let it be
[1:07:45] known that I am your
[1:07:49] prophet and I have done these things at
[1:07:51] your command
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:56] and the fire fell from
[1:08:00] heaven consumed the
[1:08:04] sacrifice consumed the
[1:08:07] Rocks licked up all the
[1:08:10] water there was nothing left but a burnt
[1:08:13] spot on the
[1:08:18] ground Hallelujah because he understood
[1:08:22] the mind of God
[1:08:27] he had received the mind of God for that
[1:08:33] day Hallelujah he knew exactly where he
[1:08:40] stood having done all to
[1:08:45] stand stand
[1:08:47] still the bride has thus sayth the
[1:08:52] Lord or she stands still
[1:08:57] amen we have been brought to an
[1:09:02] understanding am
[1:09:09] amen now we talked this morning of your
[1:09:15] mind because Faith operates in the mind
[1:09:22] realm it's anchored in the soul
[1:09:26] but it operates in the
[1:09:29] mind but it's not influenced by
[1:09:31] imagination reasoning conscience memory
[1:09:34] or
[1:09:43] affection faith is only influenced from
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:49] Eternal your reasoning can tell a lot of
[1:09:51] lies to you
[1:09:57] your imagination will lie to
[1:10:00] you your affections will lie to
[1:10:05] you it'll all lie to
[1:10:08] you but faith will never lie to
[1:10:12] you because faith is anchored in the
[1:10:18] Eternal then faith in a pure
[1:10:23] mind allows you to to see the real
[1:10:29] you because you are
[1:10:33] Eternal and what's in the
[1:10:36] eternity that has been quickened to
[1:10:40] you on which your theop is
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] built that is unique to
[1:10:50] you how many were there yesterday
[1:10:56] oh
[1:10:57] my all right I need to get Romans 8 in
[1:11:00] here
[1:11:03] then
[1:11:04] okay now in Romans
[1:11:08] 8 it says that the whole creature granth
[1:11:12] and travail waiting for the
[1:11:15] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:27] all right is that what it
[1:11:29] says can you put up on the screen for
[1:11:32] me Romans 8 I think it's somewhere
[1:11:34] around 19 or somewhere
[1:11:38] there okay now what is it telling us see
[1:11:43] the word
[1:11:46] manifestation this is good because you
[1:11:48] can click on this for
[1:11:49] me click on
[1:11:52] manifestation what does it take us
[1:11:54] what's the Greek word
[1:11:57] here
[1:11:58] apocalypsis
[1:12:00] apocalypsis that word means
[1:12:03] Revelation not manifestation you can go
[1:12:08] back Revelation chapter 1 the revelation
[1:12:12] of Jesus
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:16] Christ so when it says the earnest
[1:12:18] expectation of the creature
[1:12:26] ear the expectation of the creature go
[1:12:27] ahead turn to it
[1:12:33] 8:19 I want you to catch this are you
[1:12:35] with
[1:12:36] me all
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:49] right all right what are the what is the
[1:12:52] creature waiting for
[1:12:56] not the materialization of the sons of
[1:13:03] God it's waiting for the time when the
[1:13:06] sons of God are
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:12] revealed now where are the sons of God
[1:13:17] written that would be in the Lamb's Book
[1:13:19] of
[1:13:22] Life amen Jesus said re Rejoice not that
[1:13:25] devils are subject unto
[1:13:30] you but Rejoice that your name is
[1:13:32] written in
[1:13:35] heaven it's a greater rejoicing about
[1:13:38] the Eternal than the physical
[1:13:46] manifestation where is your name
[1:13:49] written in the land's Book of
[1:13:51] Life where is the L's Book of Life
[1:13:55] it's in the hand of him that sits on the
[1:13:58] throne but there would come a
[1:14:01] time when that seven sealed
[1:14:05] book would need to be
[1:14:08] revealed what's written on those
[1:14:11] books the names of the elect of
[1:14:16] God the sons of
[1:14:18] God you are written
[1:14:22] there that's why in this day
[1:14:25] it was necessary for the seals to be
[1:14:30] broken the cry went
[1:14:33] out who's worthy to open the
[1:14:37] book and no man was found
[1:14:40] worthy John
[1:14:42] wept why did he weep because his name
[1:14:46] was on
[1:14:48] there every Son of God was written
[1:14:52] on and if the book could not be open
[1:14:57] then the Revelation could not be made
[1:15:01] known and if it would not be revealed
[1:15:04] who you
[1:15:07] are there's no way for you to walk in
[1:15:11] that for all things are by
[1:15:17] Revelation but the angel
[1:15:19] said weep not
[1:15:22] John it for the lion of the tribe of
[1:15:27] Judah has prevailed to open the
[1:15:31] book loose the
[1:15:34] seals and John turned to see the
[1:15:38] land and he saw the
[1:15:41] land had been
[1:15:44] slain he saw
[1:15:47] Jesus who had stepped forth
[1:15:50] now
[1:15:52] ET cuz now was the
[1:15:57] time there had to come a
[1:16:01] time nobody knows the
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:05] time but it turned out that the time was
[1:16:13] 1963 and the seals were
[1:16:16] open and what came out from under the
[1:16:21] seals the revelation of the sons of God
[1:16:27] because that's what's written on the
[1:16:31] book so what came from the opening of
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:35] seals the message of this
[1:16:38] hour what came from the opening of the
[1:16:41] seals the eagle
[1:16:44] anointing and the eagle
[1:16:47] anointing as I said last time I was here
[1:16:51] is an anointing to see yourself the way
[1:16:53] God sees you
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:17:02] now remember I went to the city of
[1:17:03] Dothan last year doth the city of
[1:17:08] Dothan in the
[1:17:12] Bible elishah and his
[1:17:16] servant surrounded by the Syrian
[1:17:20] arm and the servant gets up in the
[1:17:22] morning
[1:17:25] and he's full of
[1:17:27] fear because he sees the Syrian
[1:17:31] Army that's all he can
[1:17:34] see
[1:17:36] amen now he calls out to
[1:17:39] Elijah Elisha he says we're
[1:17:43] surrounded we're in
[1:17:45] trouble our lives are going to
[1:17:49] end did Elisha get
[1:17:52] scared no because he could see more than
[1:17:56] the servant could
[1:18:01] see and he says there's more with us
[1:18:03] than there is with
[1:18:08] them now the servant was trying to
[1:18:11] believe the
[1:18:16] message okay if Elisha said it it must
[1:18:18] be
[1:18:20] true he's a Vindicated
[1:18:23] Prophet but it wasn't just believing
[1:18:25] Elisha's
[1:18:28] word Elisha lifted his voice to
[1:18:33] God and said Lord open this man's
[1:18:38] eyes in other words take the anointing
[1:18:41] that's on me as a
[1:18:45] prophet an legal
[1:18:48] anointing and put it on him who's not a
[1:18:52] prophet it will cause him to see what I
[1:18:57] see because what I see is what God
[1:19:02] sees and the servant's eyes come
[1:19:06] open now his attitude
[1:19:13] changes
[1:19:16] Hallelujah you are so tough out
[1:19:21] there take that puny Army and go home
[1:19:26] you don't want a piece of
[1:19:30] me
[1:19:32] Hallelujah nothing had
[1:19:35] changed only his eyes had
[1:19:38] come under the anointing of an
[1:19:42] eag to see into the
[1:19:46] eternity and
[1:19:48] recognize greater is he that's in US
[1:19:52] World
[1:19:55] hallelujah amen it doesn't matter what
[1:19:58] sickness you
[1:19:59] have let your eyes come
[1:20:03] open it doesn't matter what trouble you
[1:20:06] have let your eyes come
[1:20:09] open it doesn't matter what you're going
[1:20:12] through May God send his anointing upon
[1:20:15] your
[1:20:18] eyes you to
[1:20:20] understand that you are anchored in
[1:20:23] eternity
[1:20:27] As Romans 8
[1:20:29] says what shall we say to these
[1:20:32] things if God be for us who can be
[1:20:35] against
[1:20:38] us or as it says in the Old
[1:20:42] Testament no weapon formed against you
[1:20:45] will
[1:20:52] prosper oh Hallelujah
[1:20:56] that's why God sent this
[1:20:59] message so you can see what brother Bram
[1:21:04] saw even though you're not a
[1:21:07] prophet even though you're not a
[1:21:10] prophet but the last days message is an
[1:21:13] eagle
[1:21:18] anointing to open your eyes to the
[1:21:21] realities of Eternity of which you are
[1:21:30] Hallelujah we need to move beyond our
[1:21:36] thinking into the thoughts of
[1:21:41] God all
[1:21:43] right souls in
[1:21:47] prison I'm going to read this for
[1:21:50] you brother Ram says so when you see
[1:21:52] this man walking down the street
[1:21:57] he thinks he's
[1:22:01] somebody you know and got a little
[1:22:05] education a little educ he has
[1:22:09] little and
[1:22:11] things he says you you remember it's a
[1:22:14] CLA of Indiana
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:23] dust he says and that woman that's all
[1:22:26] dressed in
[1:22:29] shorts smoking
[1:22:31] cigarettes carrying on down the
[1:22:35] street twisting like she owned the whole
[1:22:40] country it's a clot of Indiana
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:47] dust that's the way it's turning
[1:22:50] back so you're not very much to begin
[1:22:53] with
[1:22:56] that's what you
[1:22:58] are but that Soul that's in
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] there that soul is what God's working
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:10] on if he can only get that nature to of
[1:23:14] that Spirit to agree with
[1:23:22] him then that nature dies
[1:23:26] the nature and love of the world
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:32] dies the things of the world is
[1:23:36] dead what's happening a son or daughter
[1:23:39] of
[1:23:41] God recognizing the things that are
[1:23:45] seen are
[1:23:48] temporal but the things that are not
[1:23:52] seen are eternal
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] then he says a man must be born
[1:24:00] again so this Nature has to
[1:24:04] die and the nature of God comes and
[1:24:07] lives in
[1:24:10] you and God is the only thing there is
[1:24:14] that never did begin or never can end
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:24] so therefore he has
[1:24:29] partnership and taken this
[1:24:33] man
[1:24:34] Earthly and this eternal
[1:24:38] spirit and put it
[1:24:41] together because God reflected himself
[1:24:44] back in
[1:24:48] that he become a man when he become
[1:24:51] Christ Jesus
[1:24:55] and he was
[1:24:57] God God was in Christ Sorry God was in
[1:25:02] Christ that he says lived in
[1:25:06] him reconciled the world to
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] himself now
[1:25:13] listen and through that perfect
[1:25:18] man each one of
[1:25:21] us imperfect
[1:25:25] that believe in
[1:25:27] God and has accepted
[1:25:31] that becomes a Perfection of
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:39] him see the only way you could accept
[1:25:43] him is to have been part of him from the
[1:25:49] beginning and when you accept him
[1:25:54] in your representation in
[1:25:59] eternity and you're
[1:26:02] confessing that part of
[1:26:04] me is more real than this part of
[1:26:08] me because this part will be
[1:26:12] changed but that part is
[1:26:16] eternal it will never be
[1:26:18] changed I'm a part of
[1:26:21] God I always was a part of God
[1:26:27] always will be a part of
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:32] God jump down one paragraph for me where
[1:26:35] it says see the first nature is
[1:26:40] gone and now we are the nature of
[1:26:48] him he lives in
[1:26:50] us we don't do our own will
[1:26:55] we do his
[1:26:57] will then
[1:27:00] what we don't think our own
[1:27:04] thoughts then he says the mind is what
[1:27:10] thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:27:13] is in every
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:18] believer there is the
[1:27:21] soul that's what we're speaking of
[1:27:25] that's the part I'm thinking of
[1:27:28] now and that's what's within us the
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] soul so what is
[1:27:37] Faith it's the mind of
[1:27:41] Christ expressed in our
[1:27:47] mind Jesus walked by Perfect faith in
[1:27:51] what the word said he was
[1:27:57] and through the revealed
[1:28:01] word we walk by Perfect
[1:28:05] faith in what the word says we
[1:28:12] are amen Amen brother says that's
[1:28:15] rapturing
[1:28:19] condition that's for every one of us
[1:28:22] that is that's for every one of us
[1:28:28] faith cannot be
[1:28:33] conquered faith cannot be
[1:28:45] defeated there was a
[1:28:48] woman the daughter of a oldfashioned
[1:28:52] Methodist preacher
[1:28:58] from way
[1:29:00] back and her daddy was a good
[1:29:02] oldfashioned
[1:29:07] preacher quickened by the word in his
[1:29:13] age under the man
[1:29:17] anointing but he
[1:29:19] believed he had
[1:29:21] Faith he had faith for his daughter
[1:29:26] his daughter got
[1:29:28] married she had a couple of
[1:29:31] children but she had a marriage
[1:29:35] breakdown and it and it broke up her
[1:29:40] life but her daddy was believing for
[1:29:45] her and her daddy and she became a
[1:29:48] drunkard rather she became a
[1:29:52] drinker she was raised
[1:29:55] right but she became a
[1:29:57] drinker but her daddy kept praying for
[1:30:01] her one day her daddy passed
[1:30:05] away and maybe he said to her on his
[1:30:11] deathbed you're a daughter of
[1:30:14] God God will come for
[1:30:17] you I'm believing for
[1:30:20] you but he wasn't going to be in this
[1:30:22] realm anymore
[1:30:25] and it seemed like her life got worse
[1:30:27] and
[1:30:30] worse and she was in a certain town
[1:30:32] where brother Brandon was going to have
[1:30:33] a
[1:30:36] meeting and she thought maybe I'll go to
[1:30:39] the
[1:30:41] meeting and she arrives at the
[1:30:44] meeting and it's so full she can't get
[1:30:49] in and she walks away from their
[1:30:51] depressed
[1:30:56] she says God doesn't
[1:30:59] care there's no hope for
[1:31:02] me I'm an old woman
[1:31:05] now this might have been my last
[1:31:12] chance but faith cannot be
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:18] defeated she leaves the
[1:31:21] meeting she goes to a diner
[1:31:25] she's sitting there all
[1:31:29] night she got a couple men in the same
[1:31:32] booth with
[1:31:35] her they're
[1:31:37] drinking there's a policeman over at the
[1:31:39] slot
[1:31:43] machine he's got his arm around a a
[1:31:45] young lady that's not his
[1:31:50] wife doing illegal gambling
[1:31:56] it was an evil
[1:31:58] place but in that
[1:32:01] meeting not the diner but in the meeting
[1:32:03] in that
[1:32:06] town God's
[1:32:08] Prophet needed a place to
[1:32:14] eat and the restaurant he was going to
[1:32:17] was closed on Sunday
[1:32:25] and so he walks into the
[1:32:29] diner now some of you will recognize the
[1:32:34] story and he looks around the room it
[1:32:38] was he looks around the
[1:32:40] room sees all the
[1:32:44] evil and it Grieves
[1:32:47] him and he says oh God why don't you
[1:32:50] just wipe the
[1:32:55] and God says let me talk to
[1:32:57] you and he goes behind the
[1:33:00] door and God shows him a
[1:33:04] vision not of those people's
[1:33:09] mistakes but of his own
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:14] mistakes and he says oh my his mistakes
[1:33:18] went up before
[1:33:20] God if they would have reached God
[1:33:24] he would have been a dead
[1:33:26] man but they struck Jesus
[1:33:30] Christ in his
[1:33:34] forehead and the blood trickled
[1:33:37] down and he thought oh
[1:33:40] my God forgive me for my
[1:33:44] mistakes and he said Jesus Took a a pen
[1:33:47] or a hand finger and dipped it in his
[1:33:49] side
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:54] and wrote on the page of brother bram's
[1:34:00] life
[1:34:03] pardoned
[1:34:07] Hallelujah now he said to brother
[1:34:10] BR he says I've forgiven
[1:34:13] you but you want to wipe them
[1:34:21] out he goes to the table
[1:34:24] it was he goes to the table where the
[1:34:26] old woman
[1:34:29] was where is he
[1:34:34] drawn faith is pushing him
[1:34:41] there not his own
[1:34:43] faith but the Eternal faith of an old
[1:34:46] Methodist
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:51] preacher my daughter must be
[1:34:58] saved and the god of
[1:35:02] Heaven arranged it
[1:35:05] so that she would be in that
[1:35:09] room and he sent his Prophet to that
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:15] place and God would show him his
[1:35:20] grace as she begin to talk to him
[1:35:25] and he asked her
[1:35:26] story and she told him all those details
[1:35:29] that I just shared with
[1:35:31] you what was it the faith of her
[1:35:39] father though it wait 25 years it'll
[1:35:42] still
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:47] happen it's the faith of
[1:35:50] Abraham it's an eternal faith
[1:35:55] and by faith we
[1:35:58] understand that time has nothing to do
[1:36:01] with
[1:36:04] it my my personal presence has nothing
[1:36:08] to do with
[1:36:09] it my personal presence has nothing to
[1:36:12] do with
[1:36:16] it but my faith can never be
[1:36:21] defeated your faith can never be
[1:36:26] defeated if your faith is anchored
[1:36:28] Beyond the
[1:36:31] Veil there's nothing can defeat
[1:36:36] it and God saw this old preacher's
[1:36:42] faith for his
[1:36:44] daughter which was a
[1:36:47] revelation the world would have said it
[1:36:49] was impossible
[1:36:53] but she was in the mind of
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:59] God and when her old daddy died he just
[1:37:02] believed
[1:37:06] that it wasn't dependent upon his
[1:37:09] fleshly
[1:37:14] efforts it was dependent on
[1:37:19] eternity his faith had told him so
[1:37:30] Hallelujah I just think that's an
[1:37:32] amazing
[1:37:35] story I
[1:37:37] always I always looked at it from
[1:37:39] Brother Brown's
[1:37:42] perspective going into the
[1:37:44] diner but then I begin to read the
[1:37:47] different things he learned from the
[1:37:48] woman
[1:37:54] and I realized God thought so much of
[1:37:57] her daddy's
[1:38:01] Faith he said the greatest
[1:38:07] Prophet
[1:38:08] PA to that
[1:38:10] place to personally deal with that
[1:38:14] [Music]
[1:38:17] woman she
[1:38:19] thought it's
[1:38:21] over there's no hope for
[1:38:24] me she's she's going to drown her
[1:38:30] sorrows she couldn't see the mind of
[1:38:35] God but one walked into the
[1:38:40] room prophet of
[1:38:42] God a prophet of
[1:38:45] God that could see the thoughts of
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:50] God by a prophetic anointing
[1:38:55] and she said to him I guess there's no
[1:38:58] hope for
[1:39:00] me he said if there's no hope for
[1:39:04] you why did God show me that
[1:39:09] Vision the vision was about
[1:39:15] her oh what a personal God
[1:39:26] oh if you have a wayward child
[1:39:31] somewhere don't you
[1:39:33] worry just say lord they're
[1:39:37] yours it's not what I
[1:39:39] do lord it's what you
[1:39:42] do I'm believing you're going to do
[1:39:48] something
[1:39:50] Hallelujah we've come to such an hour
[1:39:54] to walk in the thoughts of
[1:39:58] God it's not our efforts
[1:40:02] anymore it's God's Eternal
[1:40:07] thoughts Jesus said all that the father
[1:40:09] has given me will come to
[1:40:14] me Hallelujah all that the father has
[1:40:18] given me will come to
[1:40:20] me no man will pluck them from my hand
[1:40:24] amen God can't lose one brother Steven
[1:40:29] brother Steven said it at the end of the
[1:40:30] service this
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] morning if you have representation in
[1:40:39] heaven how can God ever let you
[1:40:43] go that eternity is no longer
[1:40:51] eternity and God is no longer
[1:40:55] God but God is
[1:40:58] God and Eternity is
[1:41:01] eternity and the word is the
[1:41:05] word and every predestinated seed of God
[1:41:09] will come to their
[1:41:17] place amen amen how many want God's
[1:41:21] understanding
[1:41:25] more than their own
[1:41:31] understanding that's why the word
[1:41:33] divides between Soul and
[1:41:39] Spirit in your spirit your
[1:41:43] mind is everything that you ever thought
[1:41:46] you
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] were but in your
[1:41:51] soul is the representation from
[1:41:56] God we could talk about the woman at the
[1:42:01] well nobody thought this woman could be
[1:42:04] saved no one nobody thought that woman
[1:42:06] could be
[1:42:09] saved there's no hope for
[1:42:12] her but that's not what the thoughts of
[1:42:14] God
[1:42:17] said I have needs to go by Samaria
[1:42:23] just like God telling his Prophet you
[1:42:25] have need to go buy a
[1:42:31] diner Jesus said I need to go buy
[1:42:35] Samaria let me put it to you another
[1:42:38] way if I don't go by
[1:42:41] Samaria the Redemptive plan of God is
[1:42:48] broken you're not looking you're not
[1:42:51] looking for seed by chance
[1:42:56] God is directing
[1:42:59] you God is leading you to this town and
[1:43:02] that
[1:43:06] town God is directing somebody to phone
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:11] you God is sending them into
[1:43:16] meetings so that they can
[1:43:19] know that this is the
[1:43:21] truth and Jesus said I have needs to go
[1:43:25] by
[1:43:27] Samaria and the disciples and their
[1:43:30] human
[1:43:33] understanding said what's in
[1:43:36] Samaria just just a bunch of make
[1:43:40] Believers they're all out of
[1:43:43] order sometimes we think Believers are
[1:43:45] only found in message
[1:43:49] churches Hallelujah
[1:43:56] but there're in other places looking for
[1:43:58] what you
[1:44:02] have and God has sent
[1:44:06] you
[1:44:07] amen says I come I'll be in you and I'm
[1:44:11] sending
[1:44:13] you the ones that send you go in
[1:44:18] you and Jesus had need to go by Samaria
[1:44:25] because he was perfectly in the thoughts
[1:44:27] of
[1:44:31] God
[1:44:33] hallelujah and he goes and sits by the
[1:44:37] well he's not looking well we better
[1:44:39] have meetings in in
[1:44:44] SAR let's set up
[1:44:46] meetings let's do something try and
[1:44:48] create a big
[1:44:51] meeting no he just just sat down by the
[1:44:55] well and
[1:44:57] waited because he knew the will of the
[1:45:01] father and here she
[1:45:05] come and he says to her he strikes up a
[1:45:10] conversation because she was a seed of
[1:45:14] God and there was something in her that
[1:45:17] was hindering her from seeing that
[1:45:24] or put it another
[1:45:27] way he was contacting her
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:32] spirit so he starts out the conversation
[1:45:37] simple are you following
[1:45:40] me he says bring me a
[1:45:44] drink she says if you why why would you
[1:45:48] a Jew ask me a Samaritan for a drink
[1:45:54] she was a little
[1:45:58] sassy she' been through some things in
[1:46:00] her
[1:46:02] life she have respect for
[1:46:06] nobody why are you asking for
[1:46:09] me then Jesus responds he says if you
[1:46:13] knew who I
[1:46:15] was you'd ask me for a
[1:46:20] drink she never heard Doctrine like that
[1:46:23] that
[1:46:24] before oh she came to the word of the
[1:46:28] hour she's starting to hear
[1:46:31] things that she's never heard
[1:46:35] before she says sir the well is deep and
[1:46:38] you have nothing to draw
[1:46:42] with and he says the water that I give
[1:46:45] you if you drink of this water you'll
[1:46:49] never thirst
[1:46:51] again oh she said sir ever give me this
[1:46:56] water and he says all right go get your
[1:46:59] husband come
[1:47:02] here now he's zeroing in on the
[1:47:09] problem she says sir I don't have a
[1:47:14] husband he says you told the
[1:47:16] truth you've had
[1:47:19] five and the one you're living with now
[1:47:21] is not your husband
[1:47:25] and Jesus said she or rather she said
[1:47:29] sir I believe you're a
[1:47:33] prophet we know when the Messiah
[1:47:38] comes listen now she didn't say when the
[1:47:41] Messiah comes he'll come to this
[1:47:46] well it wasn't tied to this
[1:47:51] Dimension but it it was tied to her
[1:47:56] soul when the word comes it must come to
[1:48:02] her that's why you received this
[1:48:06] message because when the word
[1:48:09] came it was sent for

[2:14:11] Christians are specifically driven by
[2:14:14] the
[2:14:16] Unseen because faith is looking into the
[2:14:20] Unseen
[2:14:23] when you look at the
[2:14:24] environment as a Christian you
[2:14:27] fail but as Sons and Daughters of God
[2:14:31] will look into the
[2:14:33] Unseen prophetic
[2:14:35] fa always will tap into the
[2:14:39] Unseen
[2:14:41] elishah looked into the
[2:14:43] Unseen and saw a multitude of
[2:14:48] angels and if you are going to have
[2:14:50] follow
[2:14:53] with the prophet you have to get into
[2:14:55] his
[2:14:56] room not you not get him into your
[2:15:00] room you have to climb to
[2:15:04] your come up here and I will show you
[2:15:09] that's the level of Faith where we are
[2:15:11] now and now the brother says when they
[2:15:15] go to a
[2:15:16] mouse he began to break
[2:15:19] bread he was telling them who he was by
[2:15:23] the Practical evidence of his
[2:15:26] life so I also want to say the new
[2:15:30] B DEC as a new
[2:15:33] world where in those
[2:15:37] righteousness and says behold
[2:15:41] I make all things
[2:15:44] do not I will not I make but I make on a
[2:15:51] constant
[2:15:52] basis I make all things in you if you
[2:15:56] have my mind meaning the mind of God
[2:16:01] everything will be
[2:16:02] made I look at my future through the
[2:16:06] mind of God perfect faith is based on
[2:16:10] the
[2:16:12] Unseen are you together with me so there
[2:16:16] must be a supernatural
[2:16:19] communication between this
[2:16:22] seed and God that's
[2:16:29] Revelation brother Tim has not been
[2:16:33] speaking to your
[2:16:35] mind brother te has been speaking to the
[2:16:39] ear to the seed chin that's hidden on
[2:16:43] the side amen so that's the one which
[2:16:48] God has been communicating to praise God
[2:16:52] so what can we say we have heard
[2:16:56] [Music]
[2:17:00] from praise the Lord so your
[2:17:05] faith is the evidence of the
[2:17:09] Unseen you don't have to bring it in
[2:17:12] your
[2:17:13] feelings in your
[2:17:15] emotions
[2:17:17] think the mind of God and your
[2:17:22] will be made into that Mind Of
[2:17:27] God Amen your faith is the
[2:17:31] evidence of the
[2:17:33] Rapture brother Bram says the Rapture is
[2:17:35] in
[2:17:37] you you don't have to feel it just think
[2:17:41] the things of
[2:17:42] God concerning the Rapture how is going
[2:17:46] to happen behold I show you a mystery
[2:17:49] those are the things you should move and
[2:17:52] one day you will be ched like Enoch
[2:17:58] was your
[2:18:00] Perfection is eternal you cannot put it
[2:18:03] in this emotional
[2:18:06] feeling just take the thoughts of
[2:18:10] God about your
[2:18:13] Perfection and that's what will
[2:18:15] bring will we think the mind of
[2:18:18] God and the brother
[2:18:21] in his prayer forgive us for our
[2:18:30] mind because your mind tells you are not
[2:18:32] a son of

[2:18:41] forgiven your mind tells you are the
[2:18:43] only son of
[2:18:49] God now the devil is trying to elevate
[2:18:52] you but I want tell you let's just
