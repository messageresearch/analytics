[44:33] stand up and have a word of prayer and
[44:34] go for the reason.
[44:40] Father, we thank you again this morning.
[44:43] We want to appreciate you for the blood
[44:45] of Jesus Christ
[44:48] that washes us from all sin
[44:51] all unrighteousness.
[44:54] Now you've given unto us to the access
[44:56] of the blood of Jesus
[45:00] by the preaching of the word.
[45:03] You say the gospel
[45:06] is the power of God unto salvation
[45:10] is the light of God that has come to the
[45:12] world.
[45:14] We pray may give us the grace father
[45:17] dwell in this light
[45:20] that lord we may be fully transformed
[45:23] and help us all together heavenly father
[45:27] we may yield more and more unto you
[45:31] our image changed
[45:33] we may be like the lord Jesus
[45:36] speak to us heavenly father deliver us
[45:39] from all bondage
[45:42] fill us with your spirit
[45:44] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:47] Amen. Amen. So let us go to Luke chapter
[45:50] 22.
[45:52] We're reading from verse one to verse 6.
[45:57] So the Bible says
[46:00] now the feast of the unleavened bread
[46:02] drew nigh which is called the Passover.
[46:16] And the chief priests and scribes sought
[46:20] how they might kill him, for they feared
[46:22] the people.
[46:31] Then entered Satan into Judas, son named
[46:35] Iscarot, being of the number of the 12.
[46:46] And he went his way, and communed with
[46:48] the chief priests and captains, how he
[46:52] might betro him unto them.
[47:05] And they were glad and covenanted to
[47:07] give him money.
[47:12] And he promised and sought opportunity
[47:15] to betray him unto them in the absence
[47:19] of the multitude.
[47:26] May God blessing of his word.
[47:29] You may be seated.
[47:31] Amen. Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; So I want to preach on the subject Satan
[47:35] entered Judas.
[47:41] You know by this morning when I woke up
[47:45] I knew I was going to preach about
[47:46] acceptable sacrifice.
[47:51] But then this thought came strongly.
[47:56] Then I said maybe it's for another day.
[47:59] Let me put it aside.
[48:01] It came came on came on came on.
[48:04] And now my mind was taken over to this
[48:09] and God maybe being gracious
[48:12] maybe at the end of the month we shall
[48:13] take the acceptable sacrifice.
[48:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[48:20] Bible says Satan entered Judas
[48:26] and Judas was one of the 12 apostles of
[48:29] Jesus Christ.
[48:32] And you know Judas
[48:34] &gt;&gt; was a minister of the gospel.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Judas
[48:40] was saved.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Judas was sanctified.
[48:46] And Judas
[48:48] had his name on the lamb's book of life
[48:54] and he walked with Jesus.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. He was a
[48:59] preacher of the gospel.
[49:01] He was a treasure in the church.
[49:04] You know, he was part of the 12.
[49:08] But Satan entered Judas.
[49:13] Now, that's how strange it is.
[49:16] But you see in the world that we are
[49:18] living in
[49:21] there are two powers.
[49:24] There is the power of God and then there
[49:27] is the power of Satan.
[49:30] Now in the message the greatest battle
[49:32] ever fought.
[49:34] He says, "Now, do you know we've heard
[49:39] wars after wars
[49:42] and rumors of wars,
[49:45] and if the earth stands,
[49:48] we will have plenty more wars.
[49:52] You know the time when the wars will not
[49:54] be there
[49:57] is when the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[50:00] king of the earth. When the Lord Jesus
[50:03] Christ is the Lord of lords.
[50:06] But as long as Jesus is not the Lord of
[50:09] the earth,
[50:12] there can never be peace in the earth.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. During the
[50:19] millennial reign of Christ,
[50:23] the Bible says the earth will be full of
[50:26] the knowledge of God
[50:30] and the waters cover the sea.
[50:33] You know when when waters covers a place
[50:38] even the free space is covered by water.
[50:43] When Christ is the king of the earth
[50:46] then there will be no wars at that time.
[50:50] There will be no death at that time.
[50:53] There will be no sickness at that time.
[50:55] There will be no povert at that time.
[50:58] There will be no saying that I'm better
[50:59] than you at that time.
[51:02] Everybody will be drawing from the Lord.
[51:06] Everybody will be hearing the voice of
[51:08] the Lord.
[51:10] And we shall need no preachers at that
[51:12] time
[51:14] because everybody will know what to do.
[51:18] The knowledge of God
[51:20] the earth. As long as we are not yet in
[51:23] the rain,
[51:26] all these troubles will be there.
[51:29] All these battles will be there,
[51:32] you know, you look at the nations right
[51:34] now.
[51:37] You look at the kingdoms of the world at
[51:39] this time.
[51:41] And then you compare every country.
[51:44] They have their own problems.
[51:48] They have their own battles.
[51:50] They have the things that afflict them.
[51:54] Now you may say maybe Uganda it is us
[51:58] and go to the neighboring
[52:01] then you go maybe to developed countries
[52:04] troubles everywhere
[52:07] battles everywhere
[52:09] because the devil rules the kingdoms of
[52:12] this world
[52:14] and the devil ruling the kingdoms of
[52:16] this world.
[52:18] He has nothing good to give them,
[52:21] other than sin
[52:24] other than death,
[52:26] other than you know troubles everywhere,
[52:30] this peace comes only from God.
[52:34] And as long as God is not in need,
[52:38] there is no peace. So he says there are
[52:40] two powers in the world.
[52:43] And he says the the world will still
[52:45] have more wars.
[52:49] Do you realize that there is really only
[52:51] two powers in the Holy Ghost?
[52:56] All our differences,
[52:59] between nations, our differences between
[53:02] each other.
[53:04] Everything. It all amounts to two
[53:07] powers.
[53:10] There are only two powers
[53:12] and there's only two kingdoms.
[53:16] two powers,
[53:18] two kingdoms. One is the power of God
[53:23] and the kingdom of God. And then there
[53:25] is the power of Satan. And the kingdom
[53:28] of Satan
[53:30] right now, the world in its condition is
[53:34] under the kingdoms of Satan
[53:39] right now. the way we living.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; But when you read in Genesis one,
[53:45] God created the earth,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; he gave Adam dominion over everything.
[53:53] Adam was the king of the earth.
[53:56] Adam was the god of the earth.
[53:59] But now when sin came,
[54:02] Satan
[54:04] lost his position in heaven.
[54:08] And then he came as a squatter,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; you know, to come and take over the
[54:15] earth.
[54:16] And the only way he would take over the
[54:18] earth
[54:20] was to convince Eve
[54:24] and then Adam and then they followed
[54:27] what the devil wanted them to do.
[54:31] That's how Satan took over and that's
[54:33] how Satan also takes over us.
[54:37] You know, he brings something enticing,
[54:41] something attractive
[54:43] and then you find you are lured into it.
[54:47] You know, then you get involved into it,
[54:50] you know. Then you find yourself you are
[54:52] participating into it.
[54:55] You become part of it. You become
[54:58] identified with it.
[55:01] That's how Satan takes a hold.
[55:04] As Satan takes a hold, then he starts to
[55:08] kind of, you know, have dominion,
[55:12] you know, kind of controlling
[55:13] everything.
[55:16] That even appoints his kind of, you
[55:18] know, ambassador,
[55:21] you know, maybe this demon of lying,
[55:24] maybe this demon of backbiting,
[55:27] this demon of this
[55:31] working for the kingdom of Satan.
[55:35] Now he says there are two kingdoms.
[55:40] All the rest
[55:42] even the little minor things
[55:45] are connected with either one of those
[55:47] powers
[55:50] and those powers
[55:53] there is God's power and Satan's power.
[55:58] Every war, every disorder
[56:03] and everything comes along,
[56:06] it's either controlled by God's power or
[56:09] Satan's power
[56:12] because that's the only two powers there
[56:14] is.
[56:17] That is the power of life
[56:20] and then the power of death.
[56:23] the only two powers
[56:25] and Satan can only
[56:29] his powers is got
[56:34] &gt;&gt; is perverted power of God.
[56:40] It is not real power.
[56:43] It is a perversion of godly power.
[56:49] everything that Satan has.
[56:53] So, Satan
[56:55] perverts the things of God.
[56:58] He perverts the power of God,
[57:02] perverts the word of God,
[57:05] anything that God has done,
[57:08] he uses it. Now, anything you find
[57:12] contrary to the word of God
[57:15] is of the devil. So then you need to
[57:18] live what is not of God
[57:22] because that's what the devil does.
[57:24] And what is a lie?
[57:27] A lie is the truth
[57:30] perverted.
[57:34] That's what it is. He just takes the
[57:37] opposite.
[57:39] Opposition here. Opposition here.
[57:43] Opposition here. That's what the devil
[57:45] does. Adultery
[57:50] &gt;&gt; is the right act perverted between
[57:52] wrong. The people were not meant to do
[57:54] it.
[57:58] So he just keeps on perverting.
[58:02] So he says
[58:06] death is only a perverted life.
[58:10] A lie is only truth mistold.
[58:15] Adultery is an act misused.
[58:20] Righteous a righteous act you misuse.
[58:26] Everything that Satan has
[58:29] has got is something that was perverted.
[58:35] It is a power
[58:38] and we are today
[58:40] sitting here.
[58:42] All the other power is going to control
[58:45] us.
[58:48] Let's cast out the evil one.
[58:52] Let us take our position like the stars
[58:54] of heaven.
[58:57] Now Satan, when you read in the
[59:00] scriptures in Isaiah chapter 14,
[59:05] praise the name of our Lord and then we
[59:07] can start from verse 12.
[59:11] He says, "How art thou fallen from
[59:13] heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning?
[59:16] How art thou cut down to the ground
[59:19] which did weaken the nations?
[59:35] So Lucifer,
[59:38] the Bible says son of the morning
[59:42] that was the name of Satan.
[59:46] And then he, the Bible says, for you
[59:50] have said in your heart,
[59:54] I will ascend into heaven,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; and I will exalt my throne above the
[59:59] stars of God.
[1:00:04] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:00:07] congregation
[1:00:10] in the sides of the north.
[1:00:16] So now you see that sin starts from the
[1:00:18] heart.
[1:00:20] Satan said in his heart
[1:00:24] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do
[1:00:26] this. So then you need to watch out
[1:00:30] what is in your heart. What are your
[1:00:32] thoughts?
[1:00:34] Are they thoughts of God?
[1:00:36] Thoughts of Satan? Because this is how
[1:00:39] sin starts.
[1:00:41] It starts from the heart.
[1:00:43] So then he says,
[1:00:46] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:00:49] cloud and I'll be like the most high.
[1:01:06] So Satan desired from the very beginning
[1:01:11] to be like God
[1:01:13] to compete with God.
[1:01:16] And then he convinced angels in heaven.
[1:01:21] And then they had a war in heaven.
[1:01:24] And the Bible says he was defeated in
[1:01:26] heaven.
[1:01:28] He lost his position in heaven.
[1:01:31] So he was thrown here on earth.
[1:01:34] And now when he's thrown here on earth,
[1:01:36] he also tries to find a position in
[1:01:39] earth.
[1:01:41] And that's when he was able to use the
[1:01:43] serpent.
[1:01:46] And then the serpent was able to deceive
[1:01:49] Eve.
[1:01:51] And then the sin came here on earth. And
[1:01:54] that's how Satan took over the place.
[1:01:57] And then he started doing all those kind
[1:02:00] of things.
[1:02:01] But you see the desire of Satan from the
[1:02:04] beginning.
[1:02:06] He was to be woripped like God.
[1:02:09] And so the Bible tells us that at this
[1:02:13] end time,
[1:02:15] Satan will have a man
[1:02:19] that will be worshiped like God
[1:02:23] and Satan will be in this man. The way
[1:02:27] Satan was in the serpent
[1:02:29] and then people worship the man
[1:02:33] and the man comes as if he's God
[1:02:37] and then the people believe him. The
[1:02:40] people worship him,
[1:02:43] you know, and then it will bring
[1:02:44] destruction.
[1:02:47] So what he desired in heaven,
[1:02:50] he fulfills it here on earth.
[1:02:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we
[1:02:55] should also know
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; that Satan
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; is very religious,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; very religious.
[1:03:04] When you read in the scriptures,
[1:03:06] the people who were against Christ
[1:03:11] much more than anybody,
[1:03:14] they were the religious people.
[1:03:18] They were the religious people.
[1:03:21] Now it doesn't mean that those who are
[1:03:23] not religious
[1:03:25] They can't fight God. They can't oppose
[1:03:28] God.
[1:03:30] That's the religious one.
[1:03:33] They even said he's worth of death.
[1:03:38] He desired Barabus,
[1:03:41] a murderer,
[1:03:43] a rapist,
[1:03:46] a raper,
[1:03:48] a robber.
[1:03:50] and he said we would rather live with
[1:03:51] Barabus
[1:03:53] than this Jesus here
[1:03:56] religious spirit.
[1:03:58] So then you find that Satan
[1:04:02] he uses different kind of rims.
[1:04:06] He uses the religious rim.
[1:04:10] He uses the political rim
[1:04:14] and even the demonic rim.
[1:04:17] He uses all those kind of
[1:04:20] So then if you are religious,
[1:04:22] the devil will come to you as a
[1:04:23] religious.
[1:04:27] So if you are a politician,
[1:04:29] he will also come as a politician.
[1:04:32] If you go to a shrine, there he is.
[1:04:37] He uses all those kind of things to
[1:04:39] deceive
[1:04:41] to see how we can take a hold of him.
[1:04:45] So when he came to Jesus Christ,
[1:04:48] he saw Jesus was hungry.
[1:04:51] Now you can imagine for 40 days
[1:04:55] Jesus was being tempted of the devil.
[1:04:58] But now the devil would not get anywhere
[1:05:03] to take kind of attention of Jesus.
[1:05:06] Now when the fasting ended
[1:05:10] and then Jesus was hungry
[1:05:13] and it was in a desert,
[1:05:16] there was no market there. There was no
[1:05:19] restaurant there. There was no maybe no
[1:05:22] tree with a fruit there.
[1:05:27] It was a desert. Then the devil tells
[1:05:30] them look at the situation you are in.
[1:05:33] You are hungry.
[1:05:36] You can't have food the next maybe six
[1:05:38] hours or the whole day
[1:05:41] from here.
[1:05:43] What you need to do as a son of God,
[1:05:48] turn these stones
[1:05:50] into bread and eat and the devil also
[1:05:54] comes to us like that.
[1:05:56] Sometimes you have something challenging
[1:05:58] you in life.
[1:06:01] Oh, why don't you do this? How long will
[1:06:04] you wait?
[1:06:06] And then perhaps you say this is a
[1:06:07] convincing idea
[1:06:10] and then you go by Satan.
[1:06:14] So Satan came to Jesus and Satan will
[1:06:18] always look at your weak point
[1:06:22] where is the weakest point of the chain
[1:06:28] and then they say that the chain is as
[1:06:31] strong as its weakest point.
[1:06:36] So what are your weaknesses in life?
[1:06:40] And those are the areas the devil will
[1:06:42] always come around
[1:06:45] to tempt you here, to tempt you here,
[1:06:48] your weak points.
[1:06:52] And you know in the animal kingdom,
[1:06:56] they always guard the weak ones.
[1:07:00] You always see that you guard where the
[1:07:01] weak point is.
[1:07:04] We put attention there
[1:07:06] because the devil knows that will be
[1:07:08] easier for me to go
[1:07:11] and the devil always keeps on finding
[1:07:12] out
[1:07:14] where is your weak point and then he can
[1:07:17] try to use that weak point
[1:07:20] to make sure that you fail. Now let us
[1:07:25] go to Ezekiel chapter 28.
[1:07:30] Ezekiel chapter 28
[1:07:33] And then we read in verse 12,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Son of man, take up the
[1:07:41] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[1:07:44] say unto him, thus says the Lord God,
[1:07:47] though sealst
[1:07:49] the psalm, full of wisdom and perfect in
[1:07:52] beauty.
[1:08:08] Now when Satan, you know, Satan can
[1:08:12] enter animals
[1:08:14] like the other man of Gada,
[1:08:18] you know, all the the demons which were
[1:08:20] cast by Jesus Christ from the pigs or
[1:08:23] from the man of Gada.
[1:08:27] And then they were cast into the pigs.
[1:08:31] Satan enters pigs.
[1:08:34] Satan enters people.
[1:08:36] Satan enters nature.
[1:08:39] You read Job chapter one. You find Satan
[1:08:42] enters thieves
[1:08:47] and uses them to steal. Satan enters the
[1:08:50] rapists.
[1:08:53] You know, Satan enters murderers.
[1:08:57] Satan enters animals
[1:09:01] and then they do any form of thing.
[1:09:04] Satan enters nature.
[1:09:08] He can use nature to do something which
[1:09:13] you see he used nature
[1:09:16] the winds
[1:09:18] to come and blow the house where
[1:09:20] children of Job were.
[1:09:24] So now Satan here in the scriptures
[1:09:29] in Ezekiel chapter 28,
[1:09:32] Satan had entered the king of Tyrus.
[1:09:38] And when Satan entered the king of
[1:09:39] Tyrus,
[1:09:42] the way Satan will enter the beast,
[1:09:48] the man a beast,
[1:09:53] Revelations 13 until the Bible says
[1:09:58] dragon
[1:10:00] gave him his seat,
[1:10:03] his authority
[1:10:05] and great powers.
[1:10:07] So now here Satan entered the king of
[1:10:11] Tyrus
[1:10:12] until the king of Tyrus
[1:10:15] had wisdom
[1:10:18] and understanding.
[1:10:20] And the wisdom he had understanding he
[1:10:24] had he was able to get riches
[1:10:29] and become so powerful.
[1:10:32] So now the spirit of God
[1:10:35] is looking at Satan
[1:10:37] who was in the king of Tyrus
[1:10:40] and then telling the king the Satan in
[1:10:42] the king of Tyrus.
[1:10:45] And then the spirit says, "Thus says the
[1:10:48] Lord,
[1:10:49] those up the psalm
[1:10:53] full of wisdom
[1:10:55] are perfect in beauty."
[1:10:59] Verse 13, thou hast been in the garden
[1:11:02] of Eden.
[1:11:05] Of course, now this is not the king of
[1:11:06] tyrants
[1:11:09] because he was not there. In the garden
[1:11:11] of Eden,
[1:11:13] Adam and Eve,
[1:11:15] but now he's addressing the spirit
[1:11:18] that is in the king of Tyrus.
[1:11:20] He said, "You were in the garden of
[1:11:24] a precious stone was your covering.
[1:11:30] The sadis,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; the diamond,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; the bar,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; the
[1:11:38] jasper,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; the saffer,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; the emirant,
[1:11:45] the
[1:11:47] gold, the workmanship of thy tablets
[1:11:53] and of thy pipes,
[1:11:57] were prepared in the day that Zo was
[1:12:00] created.
[1:12:11] though at the anointed cherub
[1:12:15] that covers
[1:12:17] and I've said this so
[1:12:20] was upon the holy mountain of God
[1:12:25] walkest up and down in the midst of the
[1:12:28] stones of fire
[1:12:33] was perfect in thy ways from the day
[1:12:35] that you were created.
[1:12:40] iniquity was found in them.
[1:12:45] Now he's talking about
[1:12:48] Lucifer
[1:12:51] we call Satan.
[1:12:53] And then he's describing
[1:12:56] how gifted
[1:12:59] gifted Lucifer was. Lucifer.
[1:13:03] Lucifer Lucifer had the gift of wisdom.
[1:13:08] Lucifer Lucifer had the gift of beauty.
[1:13:13] Lucifer Lucifer
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; had the gift of music.
[1:13:17] And Lucifer was anointed.
[1:13:22] He covered.
[1:13:25] He was gifted.
[1:13:28] Now that is Satan.
[1:13:30] And all the gifts that Satan had
[1:13:35] before they fall, he comes down with
[1:13:38] them.
[1:13:40] He has the gift of wisdom.
[1:13:42] He has the gift of understanding.
[1:13:45] He has the gift of beauty.
[1:13:49] He has the gift of music.
[1:13:53] He fell with those gifts. And so he uses
[1:13:56] this gift
[1:13:58] to see how he can enter the people.
[1:14:04] He has these gifts, he fell with them.
[1:14:08] Praise the name of Lord. So in the
[1:14:10] garden of Eden, even before the garden
[1:14:13] of Eden,
[1:14:15] Lucifer Lucifer was a cherubim
[1:14:20] anointed of God.
[1:14:22] And then he would sing
[1:14:25] to play
[1:14:27] until Satan uses musicians
[1:14:31] to take many people to hell
[1:14:35] and everybody patterns after musicians
[1:14:40] like now you go in the neighborhood
[1:14:43] then you get a small kid
[1:14:46] dancing like somebody else
[1:14:50] and then the people cheering you.
[1:14:53] anointing
[1:14:56] watches something, they watch something,
[1:15:00] they start doing it, Satan has already
[1:15:03] taken over their heart. So they want to
[1:15:05] behave like that.
[1:15:08] You know those days it was the mad
[1:15:11] people used to kind of wear braids
[1:15:21] and And people
[1:15:23] cuz they don't scratch they it just
[1:15:26] grows and then it coins then
[1:15:30] the demon left the mad people
[1:15:34] and then get into the musicians
[1:15:37] and now it has got into the people
[1:15:41] and then you get somebody with their
[1:15:44] young children they also doing the same.
[1:15:50] Satan enters people and then they start
[1:15:53] fashioning themselves after those
[1:15:55] things.
[1:15:57] Until now,
[1:16:00] some of the smartest people we have
[1:16:03] are those who have those hair locks and
[1:16:05] so on.
[1:16:10] They are too smart.
[1:16:14] When they reason you,
[1:16:17] you find you don't know anything.
[1:16:20] But where does that come from?
[1:16:25] You know, we got some of these best
[1:16:27] schools in the world.
[1:16:29] When you got some of the best schools in
[1:16:31] the world,
[1:16:33] best universities,
[1:16:35] you get them there,
[1:16:38] smart,
[1:16:39] intelligent.
[1:16:41] So now, but what is wrong with that?
[1:16:46] Because Satan has taken over everywhere.
[1:16:50] So Satan fell with his gift.
[1:16:54] He fell with the gift of beauty.
[1:16:56] So he uses beauty
[1:16:59] to see that he entices people.
[1:17:03] He enters people.
[1:17:06] He uses beauty.
[1:17:09] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:11] So now and what the devil does he find
[1:17:16] even the person who is very attractive
[1:17:20] you know looking so beautiful.
[1:17:23] Just talk about a woman very beautiful,
[1:17:27] very attractive. The devil will tell
[1:17:29] them.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So she wants to show her underneath
[1:17:35] garment.
[1:17:37] He won't show the private part.
[1:17:43] That's the devil. He's trying to get a
[1:17:46] hold of people.
[1:17:48] Let them see your figure
[1:17:51] until the fashion which has come
[1:17:54] what they put on is as good as they are
[1:17:57] naked.
[1:18:00] But now we'll talk about it.
[1:18:04] There are demons that have already got
[1:18:06] among us
[1:18:09] enticing this one here. Enticing this
[1:18:12] one here.
[1:18:15] And then you find somebody to choose a
[1:18:18] wife.
[1:18:19] They first look at beauty
[1:18:23] wife.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, this one I cannot take our place.
[1:18:26] No.
[1:18:31] It is so convincing.
[1:18:36] But now when they marry,
[1:18:38] he finds that beauty cannot keep
[1:18:39] marriage.
[1:18:44] could not keep her marriage.
[1:18:50] Yet she was the most beautiful person.
[1:18:55] Then he says then he knocked.
[1:19:01] How did you knock? Where were you
[1:19:02] looking?
[1:19:06] So the devil is so convincing.
[1:19:10] So he g you in that situation.
[1:19:13] You've married a beauty queen
[1:19:17] and you announce everybody to be there
[1:19:21] one year down the road.
[1:19:24] How is home
[1:19:26] your burning
[1:19:29] then you are trying to find out how do
[1:19:31] you go out of that hot home
[1:19:36] because you only looked at the outside.
[1:19:40] You didn't go further.
[1:19:44] What is inside this person?
[1:19:47] What is the character of this person?
[1:19:50] How much of God is in this person?
[1:19:54] Praise the name of the Lord. So, Satan
[1:19:56] uses this gift.
[1:19:59] You know, he can use wisdom.
[1:20:03] Maybe a sister can fall for a brother
[1:20:05] who is brilliant.
[1:20:09] The way he talks
[1:20:11] smart finish a sentence he has
[1:20:14] recommended this
[1:20:17] and then you you marry you enter you
[1:20:21] start living with him. He's very
[1:20:23] brilliant and he's too brilliant even to
[1:20:26] cheat you on everything.
[1:20:32] We can't live together.
[1:20:34] Satan uses all these things.
[1:20:38] And when he has wisdom,
[1:20:40] he gets wealth.
[1:20:42] So you he can use wealth
[1:20:45] to convince you.
[1:20:48] You know like they asking
[1:20:51] to cry in
[1:21:01] I would rather cry in the bed.
[1:21:05] Rich is taking them.
[1:21:08] But Satan puts all these kind of things
[1:21:11] in.
[1:21:13] So you need the grace of God
[1:21:17] to overcome all these wild things.
[1:21:21] Praise the name of our Lord. So Satan
[1:21:23] use these things
[1:21:26] and others
[1:21:28] they fall by the gift
[1:21:31] is a talented person.
[1:21:34] I'm going to go by this person.
[1:21:37] Satan uses this thing
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; and then he uses this that he can
[1:21:44] convince people.
[1:21:46] He can enter into the people and that's
[1:21:48] how he establishes his kingdom.
[1:21:52] Praise the name of our Lord. He fell
[1:21:54] with gift.
[1:21:57] That's what Satan is.
[1:21:59] He will use different gifts based on the
[1:22:01] circumstances.
[1:22:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:22:07] go to the book of Ezra.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Ezra chapter 6.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Ezra Ezra chapter 4
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and then we read from verse one.
[1:22:26] The Bible says,
[1:22:28] "Now when the adversaries of Judah and
[1:22:31] Benjamin
[1:22:33] had that the children of captivity
[1:22:35] builded the temple unto the Lord God of
[1:22:38] Israel."
[1:22:39] Ezra 4:1
[1:23:03] This is
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:23] Then you read it when you're finished.
[1:23:38] They came to Zerubbabel and to the chief
[1:23:41] of the fathers
[1:23:49] and said unto them,
[1:23:52] now the Bible says when the adversaries
[1:23:59] they were adversaries of Judah and
[1:24:01] Benjamin,
[1:24:04] you know, they were not at all
[1:24:08] desired anything good to happen to
[1:24:11] Israel.
[1:24:14] They never desired the city to be built
[1:24:16] again.
[1:24:18] They never desired the temple to be
[1:24:20] built again.
[1:24:22] And then the Bible says when they had
[1:24:25] Zerubbabel
[1:24:27] and the children from captivity
[1:24:30] has been given authority by the king
[1:24:34] to come and build the city.
[1:24:37] Then they come Satan.
[1:24:41] Then the Bible says he said
[1:24:44] let us build with you.
[1:24:48] Yeah, you can imagine that
[1:24:51] they are adversaries
[1:24:53] but they saying let us build with you.
[1:24:58] Satan,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; he comes in a religious form.
[1:25:03] Let us worship with you.
[1:25:07] You know God created us.
[1:25:10] You know we are
[1:25:13] but don't care how we worship.
[1:25:18] Our pastor is called
[1:25:22] you know the Holy Spirit comes down our
[1:25:24] pastor that one.
[1:25:26] So you come you'll be blessed the
[1:25:29] adversaries of Judah.
[1:25:32] Let us build together
[1:25:34] let us worship together
[1:25:38] don't care.
[1:25:40] Even if you find an at the door for us
[1:25:44] we don't worship.
[1:25:47] We just remember these idols.
[1:25:50] These are holy people. So we have not
[1:25:53] come to worship. We worship the same
[1:25:55] one. God
[1:25:57] religious
[1:26:00] say ah surely the spirit of God is in
[1:26:02] this place.
[1:26:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You start
[1:26:06] talking in
[1:26:08] oh God has been gracious
[1:26:11] religious
[1:26:16] very religious
[1:26:20] you know coming let us move together
[1:26:23] let's work together
[1:26:25] you know the devil is so smart
[1:26:30] when he went to Jesus
[1:26:32] Jesus knocked him down on being hungry
[1:26:38] Then he said, "You let us go to the
[1:26:40] mountain.
[1:26:42] Everybody desires glorious things."
[1:26:45] So they go to the high mountain.
[1:26:49] And when they reach the high mountain,
[1:26:51] the Bible says
[1:26:54] he showed him the kingdoms of the world
[1:26:56] in a moment.
[1:27:00] That's now television.
[1:27:02] This vision of New York,
[1:27:06] this vision of Paris,
[1:27:08] this vision of Los Angeles,
[1:27:12] this vision of Toro
[1:27:14] and also showed them ginger here
[1:27:19] said all these places
[1:27:23] if you want a plot,
[1:27:26] I'll give you a free hold.
[1:27:29] That's one thing you have to do.
[1:27:32] Go and cheat.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Go and change agreement
[1:27:40] because worship me
[1:27:44] then I'll give you and you know it is in
[1:27:47] the season where the devil has promised
[1:27:49] many people.
[1:27:54] If you want to become an MP,
[1:27:57] you go and bear false witness.
[1:28:01] go and lie,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; go and kill.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Go and steal.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I'll give you that leadership.
[1:28:11] And so they are busy doing whatever
[1:28:13] funny thing they doing.
[1:28:16] And what they want is that authority.
[1:28:18] So they have to first worship the devil
[1:28:22] to do evil things. Then the devil gives
[1:28:24] them.
[1:28:26] Jesus said no.
[1:28:30] You know, Satan knew that Jesus is going
[1:28:33] to be the hair to all the kingdom.
[1:28:38] He said, "Ah, I I can give them to you.
[1:28:42] You don't need to go and die. It's the
[1:28:45] time to give you this. You don't need to
[1:28:47] go through the other pain.
[1:28:51] Said you have." And that's what the
[1:28:53] devil does. He said, "You want this?
[1:28:57] Worship me here. This one
[1:29:01] for us ours
[1:29:03] first fast first fast first fast first
[1:29:03] fast first fast first fast first fast
[1:29:03] first fast first fast first fast
[1:29:06] this one is
[1:29:08] bating
[1:29:14] because you want fast money
[1:29:18] that's what the devil does
[1:29:21] so he was selling the kingdom to Jesus
[1:29:25] by worshiping
[1:29:28] Then Jesus said no.
[1:29:30] So now when he knew that Jesus is using
[1:29:33] the word of God
[1:29:36] says
[1:29:38] let us go and pray let's go in church.
[1:29:41] Then they go to the temple
[1:29:43] and then the devil
[1:29:46] takes him to the highest point.
[1:29:50] He never took Jesus to the shrine.
[1:29:55] He took him to the temple.
[1:29:58] And then we took him to the temple. He
[1:30:00] opened Psalms 91.
[1:30:04] Started quoting him. What was he doing?
[1:30:07] He was preaching.
[1:30:11] Preaching to Jesus. It is written.
[1:30:16] You need to show your power.
[1:30:18] Jump.
[1:30:21] Let them know that you have the power.
[1:30:24] Satan. Satan. So he's so religious.
[1:30:29] He will use any form of way
[1:30:33] to take a hold of you so that he can
[1:30:36] enter into you.
[1:30:39] So we have read here in Judas's career.
[1:30:43] The Bible says he went and communed with
[1:30:47] the chief priest.
[1:30:51] He was looking for opportunity
[1:30:54] to make more money.
[1:30:57] So he went said
[1:31:01] you've been looking for him all these
[1:31:03] times
[1:31:05] you want to catch him but he has many
[1:31:06] people
[1:31:08] but for me I know where he is
[1:31:11] where I'm taking you there are not going
[1:31:12] to be anyation
[1:31:19] they clapped hands and they said God has
[1:31:20] answered our prayer Judas has come
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; and then they they they Judas's scariot
[1:31:26] He went ahead.
[1:31:28] But all this
[1:31:30] Satan had entered Judah's escar.
[1:31:35] And that's what the devil can do.
[1:31:38] When Satan enters a person,
[1:31:41] you even start turning against what is
[1:31:44] right.
[1:31:47] You even start turning against what you
[1:31:49] stand by.
[1:31:52] Just because now you have taken the line
[1:31:55] of these people,
[1:31:57] they keep on influencing you,
[1:31:59] influencing you and you draw away from
[1:32:02] them.
[1:32:04] You know, you get involved in many
[1:32:06] things which are not right.
[1:32:09] You start doing things which are not
[1:32:10] right.
[1:32:12] You start hearing things which are not
[1:32:13] right. You start watching things.
[1:32:17] you start reading things,
[1:32:20] it's just the devil taking a hold of
[1:32:22] you,
[1:32:24] throwing you away
[1:32:26] from the positive influence.
[1:32:29] So now we need to identify the plans of
[1:32:33] Satan.
[1:32:36] The children of Judah and Benjamin
[1:32:39] when these people came, they were
[1:32:41] looking better than them
[1:32:44] because for them they are coming from
[1:32:45] their homes. Now for you are captive.
[1:32:49] You have come. You are imitated.
[1:32:52] You are weak. Until they were told even
[1:32:56] the world they are going to build is
[1:32:57] going to fall down by by animals.
[1:33:03] They were weak
[1:33:06] you know. So they were despised.
[1:33:09] said, "We have this money, you know,
[1:33:11] this governor, this equipment,
[1:33:14] and now to build with it."
[1:33:18] They said, "No,
[1:33:20] praise the name of our Lord." We need
[1:33:22] also to identify Satan
[1:33:25] and not make an agreement with Satan,
[1:33:28] not to be in the same kind of, you know,
[1:33:32] walk with Satan.
[1:33:34] Satan is telling you this, and you also
[1:33:37] accepting it. You need to see that you
[1:33:39] reject whatever the
[1:33:43] religious
[1:33:47] we are all going to heaven.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; The way is narrow.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. It's a
[1:33:54] narrow path.
[1:33:57] So now you have to fit in it.
[1:34:01] There are things you have to cut off to
[1:34:04] be in that narrow way.
[1:34:08] Oh, God looks at the heart.
[1:34:11] Whatever you do, cares about what you do
[1:34:13] outside.
[1:34:15] Praise the name of a woman puts on what
[1:34:18] pertains to a man,
[1:34:20] it's an abomination.
[1:34:22] That's what the Bible says. So, he
[1:34:25] cares. He wants to see what you do. He
[1:34:29] wants how you dress.
[1:34:32] Praise the name of So the Bible says
[1:34:35] they said we want to build with you
[1:34:40] because we seek your God
[1:34:44] as you do.
[1:34:47] We worship the same God. If their God is
[1:34:50] a stone,
[1:34:52] say it is the same God. If their God is
[1:34:55] a bird,
[1:34:57] say it's the same God. It's not the same
[1:34:59] God.
[1:35:01] as they said, "And we do sacrifice unto
[1:35:04] him
[1:35:09] unto him and since the days of Shahadan,
[1:35:13] king of Assa, which brought us up
[1:35:15] hither."
[1:35:25] Now you see so religious.
[1:35:28] So now the leadership
[1:35:31] and Joshua
[1:35:34] becauseel was the governor
[1:35:36] and Joshua was the high priest and the
[1:35:39] rest of the chief of the fathers
[1:35:44] said unto them,
[1:35:47] you have nothing
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; to do with us
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; to build an house unto our God.
[1:35:59] That's what you need to tell the devil.
[1:36:02] Satan for you. You're building
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; is lying,
[1:36:09] deceiving,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; fighting.
[1:36:12] So what stone is he giving you?
[1:36:16] Then he say, "But we ourselves build
[1:36:20] together
[1:36:22] the Lord our God
[1:36:25] as the king of Persia has commanded us.
[1:36:33] You need to take a determination.
[1:36:37] Praise the name of our Lord. I know this
[1:36:40] thing here
[1:36:42] is not of God."
[1:36:45] And so we see the same thing here
[1:36:48] in Nehemiah 2 and verse 19.
[1:36:53] The Bible says, "But when S Balot and
[1:36:56] Horite and Tobia the servant,
[1:37:02] the Ammonite and the Gishan the Arabian
[1:37:06] had it. They laughed us to scorn and
[1:37:11] despised us and said, "What is this
[1:37:14] thing that you do? Will you rebel
[1:37:16] against the king?"
[1:37:20] Yeah. Nehemiah chapter
[1:37:22] 2
[1:37:24] and then verse 19.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:04] Then answered I them and said unto them,
[1:38:07] the God of heaven will prosper us.
[1:38:10] Therefore, we his servants will arise
[1:38:13] and build. But you have no portion, nor
[1:38:17] a right, nor a memorial in Jerusalem.
[1:38:42] Amen. Amen. So they answered them. They
[1:38:46] have no portion.
[1:38:48] They have no right
[1:38:51] nor a memorial
[1:38:53] in Jerusalem.
[1:38:55] But you see how the devil does
[1:38:58] that. Now, but like now what's happening
[1:39:00] in the Middle East?
[1:39:04] The devil says
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; the city is ours all
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and let us divide it.
[1:39:13] Just the same thing here.
[1:39:16] They have no memorial.
[1:39:19] They have no ancestors.
[1:39:22] This is ours.
[1:39:24] And that's what the devil also does to
[1:39:26] us.
[1:39:27] But Jesus said, "Satan has no part in
[1:39:31] me."
[1:39:33] Now if Satan has no part in Christ,
[1:39:37] why do you want Satan to have part in
[1:39:39] you?
[1:39:41] Why do you want Satan to enter you?
[1:39:44] Why do you want to receive from Satan
[1:39:47] when he has no portion,
[1:39:49] no memorial?
[1:39:52] He has no inheritance in God.
[1:39:55] is just a squatter here on earth.
[1:39:59] His destination
[1:40:01] is in the lake of fire. Then why would
[1:40:04] you allow the devil to take a hold of
[1:40:07] your mind to take a hold of your mouth
[1:40:11] to take a hold of your action?
[1:40:14] So the Bible say if your right eye
[1:40:18] causes you to sin
[1:40:21] it out. In other words, this eye here is
[1:40:25] being taken to watch things which are
[1:40:27] not right
[1:40:29] said remove it.
[1:40:32] Shut it.
[1:40:34] Why would you want to be destroyed
[1:40:37] by having a portion with the devil?
[1:40:41] If your right hand causes you to sin,
[1:40:44] cut it off. In other words, wherever the
[1:40:47] devil is trying to get a hold of you,
[1:40:50] cut off that section.
[1:40:53] Cut off that area.
[1:40:55] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe it is
[1:40:57] your phone
[1:40:59] all the time on things which are not
[1:41:01] right.
[1:41:03] Take them away. Praise the name of our
[1:41:06] Lord. Why would you want to take time
[1:41:08] and do things which are not right?
[1:41:11] It is your friends. They are causing you
[1:41:14] to do things which are not right.
[1:41:16] cut them off. Praise the name of our
[1:41:19] Lord. Why would you be destroyed with
[1:41:21] them?
[1:41:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So they
[1:41:25] told them, "You have no portion. You
[1:41:28] have no memorial.
[1:41:31] You have no right." Praise the name of
[1:41:33] our Lord in Jerusalem which is the
[1:41:36] kingdom of God.
[1:41:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:41:40] back to Ezra 4
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; and then we read in verse 4.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The people of the land
[1:41:50] weakened the hands of the people of
[1:41:52] Judah and traveled them in the building.
[1:42:11] Now that's the devil does. When you
[1:42:14] reject him, then he comes to trouble
[1:42:17] you.
[1:42:20] You've rejected his false worship.
[1:42:23] Then he comes to trouble you. He
[1:42:26] troubles you. When you are coming to
[1:42:27] church,
[1:42:29] he gives you programs.
[1:42:31] He's troubling you.
[1:42:34] He troubles you by many ways
[1:42:38] or this pressure or maybe sickness
[1:42:42] or something is going to happen and then
[1:42:45] your mind is drawn away from God
[1:42:50] and then you cannot build the tabernacle
[1:42:52] of God
[1:42:55] and you are the tabernacle of God.
[1:42:58] Devil is hindering you from
[1:43:00] participating in the construction
[1:43:04] by keeping you away from church,
[1:43:08] by making you not take things of church
[1:43:10] serious,
[1:43:13] by making you not take the time you come
[1:43:15] to church serious.
[1:43:18] You know the devil, he weakens
[1:43:22] and when he's able to weaken you, you
[1:43:25] finally lose interest.
[1:43:30] even if I don't go today. And he keeps
[1:43:33] drawing you.
[1:43:36] So when you don't go, he has a list of
[1:43:40] things for you to do.
[1:43:44] Today you catch up with the work.
[1:43:48] Today you catch up with friends,
[1:43:52] catch up with the relatives.
[1:43:55] is a program which they play at around
[1:43:57] mid on Sunday.
[1:44:05] Okay, but I need to be keeping reminders
[1:44:07] there
[1:44:11] troubling us so that you are not
[1:44:14] building the house
[1:44:16] and then you find you become weaker.
[1:44:21] At the end of the day, you lose
[1:44:23] interest.
[1:44:25] no longer benefiting from these things.
[1:44:29] That's the devil.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "And they hired
[1:44:35] counselors against them
[1:44:43] to frustrate their purpose all the days
[1:44:47] of Cyrus, king of Persia, even until the
[1:44:50] reign of Darius, king of Persia.
[1:45:09] Now see, Satan uses the polit the
[1:45:12] religious realm.
[1:45:15] So when you finish when you fail him on
[1:45:17] the religious,
[1:45:20] he goes to the political
[1:45:24] and uses politics,
[1:45:27] how to frustrate you,
[1:45:30] how to take a hold of you.
[1:45:32] And this is what the devil does. And now
[1:45:35] when he uses that, maybe he has not
[1:45:38] succeeded
[1:45:40] and he goes into the demonic.
[1:45:44] attack
[1:45:47] either want to kill you or do anything
[1:45:52] or character assassinate you.
[1:45:56] In verse six, and in the reign of
[1:45:58] Ahasuras in the beginning of his reign
[1:46:02] wrote they unto him an accusation
[1:46:04] against the inhabitants of Judah and
[1:46:07] Jerusalem.
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:23] So the devil could use the religious,
[1:46:29] political
[1:46:30] and the demonic
[1:46:32] to see that he attacks us. How we can
[1:46:36] enter you
[1:46:38] now in the fourth seal.
[1:46:42] It says, "Now notice
[1:46:45] the antichrist
[1:46:48] was on a pale horse,
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:54] mixed color.
[1:46:57] A horse
[1:47:00] is a beast that represents a power.
[1:47:06] His power is all mixed.
[1:47:11] Why?
[1:47:15] I want us to move together.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; He says his color is all mixed up.
[1:47:23] Why it is politics?
[1:47:27] It's national powers.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; It's religious powers.
[1:47:35] It is demonic powers.
[1:47:38] It's all kinds of powers
[1:47:42] mixed together.
[1:47:44] Mixed pale horse wars.
[1:47:49] He got all kinds of powers.
[1:47:55] But when Jesus comes,
[1:47:58] it is one solid color.
[1:48:05] This one here is mixed colors.
[1:48:10] Red,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; white, black.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Three colors in one represented in one
[1:48:20] and three powers
[1:48:23] represented in one.
[1:48:26] a white horse, a black horse, a red
[1:48:29] horse,
[1:48:31] and the three crowns in one.
[1:48:36] I seen the crown myself
[1:48:41] stood
[1:48:44] that close and looked at it
[1:48:47] wouldn't let me get to it
[1:48:53] on the account of the glass.
[1:48:57] So there it was a big lock on it
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; sitting there in a case
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; triple crown.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; So religious power
[1:49:14] that's heavenly
[1:49:16] you know in others representing the
[1:49:17] heavenly order
[1:49:20] the political power representing the
[1:49:23] earthly order.
[1:49:26] Then the demonic representing the
[1:49:29] underneath world.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Those are now the three triple crowns
[1:49:34] on the beast have power over heaven. I'm
[1:49:38] the vic of Christ.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I'm the one who rules the world and I'm
[1:49:44] the one who decides that you can leave
[1:49:47] purgatory
[1:49:49] and then go to heaven. Triple crown.
[1:49:54] you know the powers of Satan
[1:49:56] and then he says
[1:49:59] so there he was it's the triple crown
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; the vicor of heaven
[1:50:09] purgatory
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; and earth three powers
[1:50:15] united together
[1:50:18] all mixed up in a color pale
[1:50:24] Death spoke in the whole thing.
[1:50:29] Political and religious and demonic
[1:50:33] powers
[1:50:34] mixed together.
[1:50:37] Politics. He is the king of politics.
[1:50:42] Satan is
[1:50:44] praise the name of our Lord. So you see
[1:50:46] how the devil works out.
[1:50:49] He goes into this. He goes into this. He
[1:50:52] goes into this
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; politics, religion,
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; demonic
[1:50:59] all working there in those.
[1:51:02] So then you have to be careful.
[1:51:05] How can I be in position?
[1:51:08] Praise the name of Lord. You see that
[1:51:10] the devil does not deceive me.
[1:51:15] Now when you leave the word
[1:51:19] because we are fortified by the word of
[1:51:21] God,
[1:51:24] it's the word that protects us. So now
[1:51:27] when you leave the word of God, then the
[1:51:30] devil can attack you.
[1:51:33] The devil can enter you.
[1:51:36] And that's what happened with Judas.
[1:51:39] When Judas left Jesus Christ, the devil
[1:51:42] had to take a hold of. So you need to
[1:51:45] find out what is that in your heart.
[1:51:49] What's that you desire most?
[1:51:52] What do you delight in most?
[1:51:55] Because the devil is always working out
[1:51:59] how he can enter into you,
[1:52:03] how he can enter into your family.
[1:52:05] How you can enter into your place of God
[1:52:08] for ways, how we can come and frustrate
[1:52:11] you
[1:52:13] to come and disturb this, to come and
[1:52:16] trouble this.
[1:52:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us
[1:52:20] go to Luke chapter 10
[1:52:23] and then verse 17.
[1:52:26] The Bible says, "And the servant
[1:52:28] returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
[1:52:31] even devils are subject unto us through
[1:52:34] thy name.
[1:52:45] said unto them, I beheld Satan as
[1:52:49] lightning fall from heaven.
[1:52:59] Now see how the Lord is telling us here
[1:53:02] that Satan falling from heaven.
[1:53:06] Now at the time we are in Satan has
[1:53:10] access
[1:53:13] to reach everywhere.
[1:53:16] Praise the name of our Lord. He can go
[1:53:18] to heaven, hell, even here on earth.
[1:53:23] He has access.
[1:53:25] He's not yet bound.
[1:53:27] He can also have access to you
[1:53:31] what he wants you to do. Just give him
[1:53:34] your ear.
[1:53:37] And then he will preach to you. Then he
[1:53:40] will pre he will influence you. Open
[1:53:42] your eyes to what he's doing.
[1:53:48] He just sees how he has access to you.
[1:53:53] So here the Bible says that can fall
[1:53:56] from heaven
[1:53:58] like lightening.
[1:54:00] What is lightening? Is something
[1:54:02] glorious.
[1:54:04] He comes with such power,
[1:54:07] great influence.
[1:54:10] What a great wonder,
[1:54:12] what a great miracle.
[1:54:15] In Matthew chapter 24 and verse 24, the
[1:54:19] Bible says, there shall arise false
[1:54:22] Christ
[1:54:25] and false prophets.
[1:54:28] In other words, falsely anointed
[1:54:33] people.
[1:54:35] Let me talk about this false anointing.
[1:54:38] It is an anointing
[1:54:41] of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:44] on the wrong of vessel
[1:54:47] until they do the signs and the wonders.
[1:54:53] The blind will see,
[1:54:55] the sick will be getting you know the
[1:54:58] lame will walk
[1:55:00] power of God but wrong vessel.
[1:55:05] He uses deception.
[1:55:09] And so the Bible is warning us that even
[1:55:12] in this end time
[1:55:14] the devil will come like that.
[1:55:17] Here I was falling like lightning.
[1:55:21] glory
[1:55:22] and power.
[1:55:24] So you have to be careful
[1:55:27] what you are following.
[1:55:29] You must be careful. What are you
[1:55:31] listening to?
[1:55:33] You must be careful. What are you
[1:55:36] watching?
[1:55:38] Because all these are dreams of Satan.
[1:55:41] How he can enter into you.
[1:55:46] He uses all these things.
[1:55:49] Now the Bible says in Deuteronomy
[1:55:52] chapter 13
[1:55:54] and then verse one
[1:55:58] chapter 13 and then verse one.
[1:56:05] If there arise among you a prophet or a
[1:56:10] dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a
[1:56:13] sign, or a wonder,
[1:56:25] The wonder come to pass
[1:56:28] where of he spoke unto you, saying, Let
[1:56:32] us go after other gods, which thou hast
[1:56:35] known, and let us serve them.
[1:56:53] You shall not hearken unto the words of
[1:56:56] that prophet or the dreamer of dreams.
[1:56:59] For the Lord your God provest you to
[1:57:02] know whether you love the Lord your God
[1:57:05] with all your heart and with all your
[1:57:07] soul.
[1:57:24] You shall walk after the Lord your God
[1:57:27] and a fear him and keep his commandments
[1:57:31] and obey his voice and you shall serve
[1:57:33] him and cleave unto him.
[1:57:56] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:57:58] somebody will do signs,
[1:58:00] do wonders, miracles and then they will
[1:58:03] come to pass and truly the thing has
[1:58:07] been true.
[1:58:09] But then if he speaks something contrary
[1:58:13] to the word
[1:58:16] in other words he's not teaching you the
[1:58:19] word of God.
[1:58:22] He says reject that person
[1:58:25] because God has permitted those signs
[1:58:27] and wonders to happen
[1:58:30] to prove you.
[1:58:33] Do you really love God or not love?
[1:58:36] So our love for God
[1:58:39] comes by the obedience of the word of
[1:58:41] God.
[1:58:44] Praise the name of our Lord. The word
[1:58:46] that God has given to us
[1:58:49] is what God requires us to obey.
[1:58:53] Not just to follow a sign,
[1:58:55] not just to follow a wonder,
[1:58:58] but what does the word of God say in
[1:59:02] you know the Bible says in Revelations
[1:59:04] chapter 13
[1:59:07] that the beast out of the earth
[1:59:12] will do signs and wonders
[1:59:16] until we deceive the world.
[1:59:20] The Bible says here
[1:59:22] in verse 14, Revelation 13:14,
[1:59:27] let us start from verse 13.
[1:59:30] And he does great wonders so that he
[1:59:33] makes fire come from heaven on the earth
[1:59:36] in the sight of men.
[1:59:45] And he deceiveth them that dwell on the
[1:59:47] earth by the means of those miracles
[1:59:50] which he had power to do in the sight of
[1:59:52] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[1:59:54] the earth, that they should make an
[1:59:57] image to the beast, which had the wounds
[2:00:00] by the sword and did live.
[2:00:21] Now,
[2:00:22] Satan, Satan doing all he can to
[2:00:26] deceive.
[2:00:28] So, he uses signs and wonders.
[2:00:32] But then, what is the voice behind those
[2:00:34] things?
[2:00:37] Where is the word of God?
[2:00:39] So the Bible told us we need to love God
[2:00:45] and keep his commandments
[2:00:47] and obey his voice and cleave only to
[2:00:51] him. So now Satan can use anything
[2:00:54] religious
[2:00:56] to take a hold of a person
[2:00:59] to deceive a person to enter into a
[2:01:02] person. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:01:05] we need to see that we are watchful.
[2:01:09] What is this happening nowadays?
[2:01:13] What is it up to?
[2:01:16] So you don't go by a bandwagon
[2:01:21] because many people are following this
[2:01:22] thing. We have to follow the
[2:01:26] thing is what is behind it
[2:01:29] and the main thing what is the word?
[2:01:33] What is the word talking about? What are
[2:01:36] they talking about?
[2:01:38] Preaching on the word of God
[2:01:41] has given us a message of the hour
[2:01:44] which is the standard that we have now.
[2:01:47] So you use this message of the hour
[2:01:51] to prove everything
[2:01:53] to find out what is this thing leading
[2:01:55] us to.
[2:01:57] Praise the name of God. so that you are
[2:01:59] protected
[2:02:01] from the lying spirits of Satan.
[2:02:05] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[2:02:07] there was a time when King Jehoshaphat
[2:02:11] went and visited King Ahab in Israel
[2:02:15] and Ahab wanted to go and redeem Ramos
[2:02:18] Gilead.
[2:02:22] And then he told Joseph,
[2:02:25] "Oh, let us go to Ramos Gillad.
[2:02:29] said I'm your brother
[2:02:31] when
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; let us ask a prophet
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; now
[2:02:41] he was a religious man but the Bible
[2:02:44] says there was nobody as terrible as
[2:02:51] but he was a religious man so he had 400
[2:02:54] prophets
[2:02:58] Hebrew prophets.
[2:03:00] So he called them and Zedekiah was their
[2:03:03] their chief.
[2:03:05] Come and prophesy. What are we going to
[2:03:07] do in Ramos Gill?
[2:03:09] Then they said you go out,
[2:03:13] you're going to win. They all prophesied
[2:03:16] good to the king.
[2:03:18] Then Jehoshaphat
[2:03:20] being a religious man being a person who
[2:03:24] fears God
[2:03:26] and there are no other prophets.
[2:03:29] So it's not following many people
[2:03:32] but it's following where the truth is
[2:03:35] where is the truth in
[2:03:38] not how many people have voted for it
[2:03:42] or how many people are following this.
[2:03:46] Where is God in this thing?
[2:03:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Then I have
[2:03:52] told Jehoshaphat,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; I have one called Mikai.
[2:03:58] I hate him.
[2:04:00] Said don't say like that. Okay, you go
[2:04:02] and tell him. So now they sent a servant
[2:04:05] to Mikai.
[2:04:07] Then Mikai they told him you know all
[2:04:10] the prophets are talking well about the
[2:04:12] king
[2:04:15] also what you need to do come and also
[2:04:18] stamp the same thing
[2:04:20] we have to sign our petition that we
[2:04:22] talking about the same
[2:04:26] just be part
[2:04:28] he said what the Lord shows me is what
[2:04:30] I'm going to say
[2:04:33] just come and tell them anything
[2:04:35] but he waited on the Lord
[2:04:38] until he heard the word from the Lord.
[2:04:41] Then he came and then he told the king,
[2:04:44] "Ah, go up." Because the king wanted to
[2:04:47] hear that.
[2:04:50] Now, when we come to church, we don't
[2:04:52] come to hear what we want to hear.
[2:04:55] But want to hear what the Lord has for.
[2:04:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And
[2:05:00] sometimes may not be suitable to you,
[2:05:04] but it is medicine.
[2:05:07] Praise the name of God. Just take it in
[2:05:09] good faith.
[2:05:11] Maybe there's a way your weakness has
[2:05:13] been identified.
[2:05:16] The Lord have mercy upon me.
[2:05:19] And you know God is so gracious that
[2:05:22] when he speaks about your weakness,
[2:05:25] it shows he has given you the grace to
[2:05:28] overcome it.
[2:05:30] Say Lord, I want to be delivered out of
[2:05:32] this. Praise the name of. Then you
[2:05:36] reject that
[2:05:38] because at that point you are hearing
[2:05:41] the truth
[2:05:43] and the lord is telling you there is
[2:05:45] mercy here is here for your deliverance
[2:05:50] don't reject it. So so
[2:05:54] was told please if you go in the battle
[2:05:59] I saw Israel
[2:06:01] as a a sheep without a shepherd.
[2:06:06] said you see him he doesn't like me said
[2:06:10] you know he's talking bad about
[2:06:13] then Mai told them
[2:06:17] let us go to 2 Coronicles chapter 18
[2:06:22] praise the name of our Lord 2 Coronicles
[2:06:26] chapter 18
[2:06:30] and then
[2:06:33] verse 18
[2:06:36] And again he said, "Therefore hear the
[2:06:38] word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting
[2:06:41] upon his throne and all the host of
[2:06:44] heaven standing on his right hand and on
[2:06:46] his left.
[2:07:03] And the Lord said, "Who shall entice
[2:07:06] Ahab, king of Israel, that he may go up
[2:07:09] and fall at Ramothth Gilead?" And one
[2:07:11] spoke, saying, "After this manner, and
[2:07:13] another saying after that manner.
[2:07:31] Then there came out a spirit and stood
[2:07:34] before the Lord and said, I will entice
[2:07:38] him. And the Lord said unto him,
[2:07:40] wherewith
[2:07:55] And he said, "I will go out and be a
[2:07:59] lying spirit in the mouth of all his
[2:08:02] prophets." And the Lord said, "Those
[2:08:04] shall entice sin, and those shall also
[2:08:07] prevail. Go out and even do so.
[2:08:28] Therefore, behold, the Lord has put a
[2:08:32] lying spirit in the mouth of these thy
[2:08:35] prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil
[2:08:38] against you.
[2:08:49] But how did it happen?
[2:08:52] Because they didn't want to hear the
[2:08:53] truth.
[2:08:56] So because they don't want to hear the
[2:08:58] truth,
[2:09:00] they open up to lying spirits.
[2:09:04] And that's the same thing with us. When
[2:09:07] we don't take what the word of God tells
[2:09:10] us,
[2:09:12] The devil is right there to enter in.
[2:09:17] He's just ready
[2:09:19] because you have you have rejected to
[2:09:21] turn right.
[2:09:24] Then which way is left? The wrong way.
[2:09:28] And that's what Satan does every other.
[2:09:32] So you need to find out the decisions
[2:09:34] you are making.
[2:09:36] Is it the Lord leading you?
[2:09:40] by the power of God or by the power of
[2:09:43] Satan. So now when Ahab and his prophets
[2:09:48] refused to hear the word of God,
[2:09:51] a lying spirit
[2:09:54] came and took a hold of them and they
[2:09:57] believed a lie
[2:10:00] thinking that it's the truth
[2:10:02] until Zedekiah
[2:10:05] came and smoke the mouth of Mica.
[2:10:10] And he said to him, "Which way went the
[2:10:13] spirit of the Lord for me to speak to
[2:10:15] you?"
[2:10:19] He was convinced
[2:10:21] that he had the spirit of God. Yet it
[2:10:24] was a lying spirit,
[2:10:27] Satan in a religious way.
[2:10:30] The Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 7
[2:10:34] and then verse 21 that many will come
[2:10:38] that day.
[2:10:39] Lord, I did miracles.
[2:10:42] Lord, I prophesied and I did this great
[2:10:44] thing. And they were sincere.
[2:10:48] They were talking of the Lord.
[2:10:51] Lord,
[2:10:53] an idol worshiper.
[2:10:55] Lord, I did this in your name.
[2:10:59] Even these people
[2:11:01] and others they were fully convinced it
[2:11:05] was the Holy Spirit that was upon them.
[2:11:08] So he said go up and I will prosper you.
[2:11:12] Go up and I will prosper you. But how
[2:11:16] did an evil spirit take a hold of them?
[2:11:20] Because they rejected the truth.
[2:11:23] And the truth is our protection.
[2:11:27] Sometimes it may not be the best option
[2:11:30] there.
[2:11:32] Maybe when you are a youth,
[2:11:35] you know, I also need to go and learn
[2:11:36] dancing.
[2:11:39] People can see me my dancing stroke
[2:11:42] things like that.
[2:11:44] But where are you learning from?
[2:11:48] Then now they bring for you secular
[2:11:49] music. So you have to go by those kind
[2:11:52] of things.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[2:12:01] is to show yourself on Tik Tok.
[2:12:11] There is a way they kind of put
[2:12:13] themselves suggesting to somebody they
[2:12:15] don't know.
[2:12:25] And it is common now
[2:12:28] not only among the youth
[2:12:30] but even the elderly
[2:12:33] then he puts
[2:12:43] then you start wondering what is
[2:12:47] This one puts it there. You can put it
[2:12:49] there. Others in the suggestive world
[2:12:52] they are dancing,
[2:12:57] dancing,
[2:12:58] sitting, maybe lying on the bed,
[2:13:03] many different things,
[2:13:05] just evil spirits that are taking a hold
[2:13:08] of the people. Maybe since this friend
[2:13:11] has done it,
[2:13:15] let me also do it.
[2:13:17] enticing spirits.
[2:13:20] Now in the message enticing spirits
[2:13:23] he says now today so many people are
[2:13:27] listening
[2:13:30] so many people are listening to enticing
[2:13:33] spirits
[2:13:35] and instead of taking the word of God
[2:13:41] spirits
[2:13:42] they are in the world
[2:13:45] they are demons
[2:13:47] and they go out into places
[2:13:51] and get amongst men,
[2:13:57] ministers.
[2:13:59] They get among his church members.
[2:14:03] They get among good people
[2:14:07] and they cause them to come into
[2:14:09] illusion
[2:14:13] and they say things, they do things,
[2:14:17] they teach things, they practice things
[2:14:20] which are contrary
[2:14:23] to the word of God. Today ministers and
[2:14:28] other congregations
[2:14:31] are allowing their people to play cards
[2:14:33] in the churches.
[2:14:37] Many of them now that's not all together
[2:14:40] Catholic but there's a lot of
[2:14:42] Protestants that does that.
[2:14:46] What are they trying to do?
[2:14:49] It is a substitutionary something.
[2:14:55] They try to adopt some new plan.
[2:15:00] They try to adopt education to take the
[2:15:02] place of the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:06] You'll never be able to do it.
[2:15:10] No matter how well your man is educated,
[2:15:15] I think it is a good thing for him to be
[2:15:17] educated.
[2:15:20] But if he has not got the Holy Ghost
[2:15:23] with that
[2:15:26] his education will do no good.
[2:15:30] Education will never take the place of
[2:15:32] the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Enticing
[2:15:40] spirit.
[2:15:42] You know the devil just entices you into
[2:15:44] this thing
[2:15:46] into this thing and then you find you
[2:15:48] part of it and so you start defending
[2:15:51] it. You don't want to leave it. You live
[2:15:55] after that thing.
[2:15:58] We need to be careful about enticing.
[2:16:01] Praise the name of God. Enticing spirits
[2:16:03] at home. Enticing spirits at places of
[2:16:06] work. Enticing spirits at places of
[2:16:09] study or in the community.
[2:16:12] and you find yourself you do that thing
[2:16:14] and you don't care.
[2:16:18] So we need to guard ourselves
[2:16:21] against the enticing spirit.
[2:16:24] Allow the Holy Spirit
[2:16:27] to take charge over your life. Praise
[2:16:29] the name of our Lord. And when it is the
[2:16:31] Holy Ghost that has charge over your
[2:16:34] life, it will always lead you to the
[2:16:37] word of God.
[2:16:39] The Holy Ghost will teach you the word.
[2:16:41] The Holy Ghost will remind you the word
[2:16:44] and tell you no this thing is not.
[2:16:46] You're taking a wrong direction. This is
[2:16:49] the way to take. Praise the name of God.
[2:16:52] We need to see that we avoid enticing
[2:16:55] spirit.
[2:16:58] Praise the name of Lord. Let us go to
[2:17:00] the book of second Thessalonians.
[2:17:04] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[2:17:09] The scripture says
[2:17:15] the time has gone. I don't want to get
[2:17:17] into a lot here. But let us start from
[2:17:20] verse three.
[2:17:23] Let no man deceive you by any means for
[2:17:26] that they shall not come except there be
[2:17:28] a falling away first and the man of sin
[2:17:31] be revealed the son of pition.
[2:17:52] Now you see how Satan works.
[2:17:55] The way it was in the garden of Eden,
[2:17:58] there were two trees. the tree of
[2:18:01] knowledge of good and evil
[2:18:04] and then the tree of life. And these two
[2:18:07] trees according to the message of the
[2:18:09] hour have always been intertwined.
[2:18:15] You know they are always together but
[2:18:18] they are totally different.
[2:18:21] Satan and Jesus
[2:18:25] always intertwined.
[2:18:27] Satan,
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Cain,
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Cain.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Then you see Abel,
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Adam,
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Adam
[2:18:35] all together.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; So even now when it came to the time of
[2:18:39] Jesus Christ,
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Satan took a hold of Judah Escariot.
[2:18:47] So the spirit of antichrist,
[2:18:51] you know, when Jesus was going to the
[2:18:53] cross,
[2:18:55] the spirit of antichrist
[2:18:57] also took Judas to hang himself
[2:19:02] trying to resemble.
[2:19:06] You have died on the the cross. I'm also
[2:19:07] dying on on the tree hanging myself.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; So Satan is always there.
[2:19:16] I'm also present.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; I'm also here.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament.
[2:19:22] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[2:19:24] they use the animal sacrifices.
[2:19:30] Now, Satan at first,
[2:19:33] he thought was it was plants.
[2:19:36] So, he says they ate an apple.
[2:19:40] Then later on said
[2:19:43] God is not on the apple.
[2:19:46] Then he started also copy.
[2:19:49] Now when God lifts the animal sacrifice
[2:19:54] and now takes the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:57] The devil says
[2:20:00] we want blood.
[2:20:03] You have bought a car. You have to uh
[2:20:07] you are building a house. You have to
[2:20:09] shed blood.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; So whatever God leaves,
[2:20:14] the devil takes over.
[2:20:17] In the Old Testament, the priest of
[2:20:19] Aaron,
[2:20:21] their priesthood,
[2:20:23] they had garment to put on
[2:20:28] everything. Now God lives that in the
[2:20:31] New Testament.
[2:20:33] The devil says
[2:20:38] that you have to wear a bishop
[2:20:42] you put on the crown things.
[2:20:46] The devil just knows how to copy
[2:20:50] following.
[2:20:52] So now here the Bible says the man of
[2:20:56] sin,
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; the son of pition
[2:21:03] And this is the beast in Revelation 13.
[2:21:07] He's a man. And then the Bible says who
[2:21:11] opposes
[2:21:13] and exalts himself
[2:21:16] above all
[2:21:19] that is called God,
[2:21:22] all that is worship.
[2:21:24] So that he
[2:21:30] so this man of sin says I'm God
[2:21:37] and sits in the temple of God
[2:21:40] showing himself is God.
[2:21:44] The mind of the devil in Isaiah 14
[2:21:49] like the most high.
[2:21:52] So he uses it now in the man of sin.
[2:21:55] Then he says
[2:21:57] he shows himself like God.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Remember ye not when I was you, yet I
[2:22:05] told you these things.
[2:22:12] And now you know what withholdeth that
[2:22:15] he might be revealed in his time.
[2:22:27] Now let us jump that. And then the Bible
[2:22:30] says verse 10, and with all deceivers of
[2:22:34] unrighteousness in them that perish,
[2:22:43] because they received not the love of
[2:22:46] the truth, that they might be saved.
[2:22:54] What does God do? They have rejected the
[2:22:57] truth. They have not they don't have the
[2:23:00] love for the truth.
[2:23:02] So the Bible says in verse 11,
[2:23:06] "And for this cause
[2:23:09] God shall send them strong delusion.
[2:23:23] that they all might be damned who
[2:23:25] believe not the truth but have pleasure
[2:23:28] in unrighteousness
[2:23:36] because they rejected the truth.
[2:23:39] So lies come
[2:23:42] you know false things comeing
[2:23:45] spirits come and that was the condition
[2:23:48] of Judah he refused to follow Christ
[2:23:53] He had his own schemes.
[2:23:56] He had his own kind of games and drama.
[2:24:01] So at the end of the day because he has
[2:24:04] rejected the truth.
[2:24:07] Lying spirits went into him.
[2:24:11] Satan entered Judah. How did it come?
[2:24:16] Because he rejected the truth.
[2:24:19] But we are not of them.
[2:24:22] who reject the truth. Praise the name of
[2:24:24] our Lord. We are here because we believe
[2:24:27] the truth,
[2:24:29] because we love the truth, because we
[2:24:31] obey the truth. So then you need to see
[2:24:35] your love for God
[2:24:39] is not taken by anything else.
[2:24:43] See that you stand firm on the word of
[2:24:45] God.
[2:24:47] Praise the name of our Lord. See that
[2:24:49] you don't worship Satan.
[2:24:52] See that you deny Satan access.
[2:24:57] And if you have never accepted the Lord
[2:24:59] Jesus as your personal savior,
[2:25:02] the way to overcome Satan,
[2:25:05] accept the Lord Jesus as your personal
[2:25:07] savior.
[2:25:09] And when you accept Christ as your
[2:25:10] personal savior,
[2:25:13] you need to be obedient to the word.
[2:25:17] Allow the Lord Jesus
[2:25:20] as your savior
[2:25:22] and not only as your savior
[2:25:25] as the Lord.
[2:25:27] In other words, he rules your mind.
[2:25:31] He rules your heart. He rules your
[2:25:33] action. You allow Christ to take over
[2:25:36] everything.
[2:25:38] Let him be your king. Let him be your
[2:25:41] Lord. Praise the name of our Lord and be
[2:25:44] obedient to him.
[2:25:46] And when you are following him, continue
[2:25:49] in the word.
[2:25:51] Because if you don't continue in the
[2:25:53] word, that's when the devil comes in and
[2:25:56] then he brings this suggestion. He
[2:25:58] brings the other suggestion, you know,
[2:26:00] to see how he can take you away from
[2:26:02] him.
[2:26:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:26:07] to the book of first Peter chapter 5.
[2:26:12] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:26:14] 5 and then verse 6.
[2:26:18] The Bible says,
[2:26:20] "Be
[2:26:22] humble, humble yourselves before the
[2:26:25] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[2:26:28] in due time.
[2:26:37] Casting all your care upon him, for he
[2:26:41] cares for you.
[2:26:49] He says, "Humble yourself."
[2:26:52] And you know, when you humble yourself
[2:26:54] before God,
[2:26:56] then he gives you grace
[2:26:59] to overcome Satan.
[2:27:02] That's how it works. Humble yourself
[2:27:05] and you humble, obey the word of God.
[2:27:09] Whatever the Lord says, Lord, I'm going
[2:27:12] to do.
[2:27:13] Lord, I'm going to do it. You are
[2:27:15] humbling yourself. And when you humble
[2:27:18] yourself, then the Lord gives you the
[2:27:21] grace.
[2:27:23] Praise the name of the Lord to overcome
[2:27:25] those stressions.
[2:27:28] He exalts you
[2:27:31] in in conditions,
[2:27:34] you know, in stress of temptation.
[2:27:37] He raises you up. He lifts you up. He
[2:27:42] gives you more grace.
[2:27:44] He gives you the victory over the
[2:27:46] conditions you're going through
[2:27:49] because you are relying on him. Then he
[2:27:51] says, "Cast all your cares upon him,
[2:27:56] your troules, all your weaknesses.
[2:28:00] Lord, the devil is after me.
[2:28:03] Lord, the devil is taking a hold of me.
[2:28:06] That care
[2:28:08] and he says he cares.
[2:28:10] Be sober.
[2:28:12] Be vigilant.
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:18] Your adversary the devil
[2:28:22] as a roaring lion
[2:28:25] walketh about
[2:28:28] seeking whom he may devour.
[2:28:32] The Bible says he walks about
[2:28:41] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:28:44] like in the days of Job, God was asking
[2:28:46] Satan, where are you coming from? Said,
[2:28:50] I'm coming from up and down.
[2:28:53] We shouldn't be like Satan. Also, you're
[2:28:55] also walking up and down, up and down.
[2:28:58] Which program do you have this week?
[2:29:02] You're waiting for the wind to move you
[2:29:04] the other side.
[2:29:06] And now that we in the political season,
[2:29:09] you hear there is this here.
[2:29:17] You don't have life like that.
[2:29:21] You just wait for the day
[2:29:25] tomorrow. No,
[2:29:27] that's how Satan does
[2:29:30] running into this,
[2:29:33] running into this. We shouldn't be like
[2:29:35] that.
[2:29:36] You are meant to be busy with something.
[2:29:41] Praise the name of something keeping you
[2:29:44] busy in the course of the day.
[2:29:46] So the devil walks around like that.
[2:29:50] He comes here, then he goes there, then
[2:29:54] he goes there, then goes there. It
[2:29:56] shouldn't be like that. Then the Bible
[2:29:58] says, whom resist steadfast in faith,
[2:30:04] Knowing
[2:30:06] that the same afflictions
[2:30:10] are accomplished in your brethren
[2:30:14] in the world says resist him steadfast
[2:30:20] and you resist him.
[2:30:23] You shall know the truth
[2:30:26] the truth shall make you free.
[2:30:28] It's by the word of God.
[2:30:31] Is this the devil? He tells you this,
[2:30:34] you say, "No, it is this." He says this,
[2:30:37] "No, it is this.
[2:30:40] Praise the name of God." So, you need to
[2:30:42] see that you stand firm on the word of
[2:30:43] God.
[2:30:47] James 4:6,
[2:30:50] the Bible says, "But he gives more
[2:30:53] grace. Wherefore he says, God resists
[2:30:57] the proud, but gives grace unto the
[2:30:59] humble.
[2:31:20] Then he says, "Submit yourselves
[2:31:24] therefore to God. Resist the devil and
[2:31:27] he will flee from you."
[2:31:37] He says, "Submit yourself to God.
[2:31:41] You know, be obedient to God. Allow God
[2:31:45] to take charge over your life
[2:31:47] because God knows the end from the
[2:31:49] beginning
[2:31:52] challenges ahead of you. So you obey God
[2:31:56] and the word of God. And when you are
[2:31:58] obedient to the word of God,
[2:32:00] that's how you have the ability
[2:32:03] to resist the devil. And then he says
[2:32:05] when you resist Satan
[2:32:08] he will flee
[2:32:10] but when he flees takes another time.
[2:32:14] Then he comes walking around.
[2:32:19] Are you still refusing?
[2:32:22] Are you still staying with God?
[2:32:25] Oh God you left him.
[2:32:28] You know he says resist the devil then
[2:32:32] he will flee away from you.
[2:32:35] Draw nigh to God and they will draw nigh
[2:32:38] to you.
[2:32:39] Cleanse your hands you sinners
[2:32:42] and purify your hearts you double
[2:32:44] minded.
[2:32:49] Praise the name of our Lord says draw
[2:32:51] nigh to God.
[2:32:54] draw nigh to him in prayer and reading
[2:32:58] the word, obeying the word, testifying
[2:33:02] about the word, doing whatever the Lord
[2:33:04] wants you to do
[2:33:07] to draw near to him.
[2:33:10] Allow God to take charge over your life
[2:33:13] and then the devil,
[2:33:15] he will not have opportunity
[2:33:18] to enter you. Praise the name of our
[2:33:20] Lord. Satan entered Judas.
[2:33:24] And you know what happened to Judah?
[2:33:27] His end was not pleasant.
[2:33:30] We should not allow Satan
[2:33:33] to enter us. Praise the name of our Lord
[2:33:36] or to entice us or to convince us or to
[2:33:40] mislead us. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:33:44] But we have got the power, the power of
[2:33:47] God that defeats Satan at any time,
[2:33:52] any place in any condition. Praise the
[2:33:56] name of God. Just take on the power of
[2:33:58] God,
[2:34:00] the Holy Spirit to live in your life and
[2:34:03] then you'll overcome whatever the devil
[2:34:05] does. Praise the name of our Lord. Just
[2:34:08] be encouraged
[2:34:10] that we have greater is in us.
[2:34:14] God that is in us is greater than the
[2:34:17] devil that's in the world. The devil is
[2:34:20] trying to come.
[2:34:22] Greater is he that is in us than the
[2:34:24] devil that's in the world. And so you
[2:34:27] stand firm
[2:34:29] strong even when others are falling.
[2:34:33] The Bible says that 10,000 will fall
[2:34:36] this side.
[2:34:38] And then 1,000 decide
[2:34:41] that my confession is
[2:34:44] I will still stand.
[2:34:46] Praise the name of the Lord. How many
[2:34:48] are standing with the Lord?
[2:34:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[2:34:52] stand on the promises of God.
[2:34:55] May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let us
[2:34:59] sing that song. Standing on the promises
[2:35:01] of God.
