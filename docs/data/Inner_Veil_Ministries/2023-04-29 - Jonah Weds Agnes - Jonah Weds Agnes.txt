[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] videos [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] come on [Music] foreign [Music] baptism is by Imagine in water not sprinkling water in the foreign the family of our brother you're welcome to have you today Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we once again want to thank you Lord for this afternoon that you've given unto us alone to be part of this function the wedding of our brother and our sisters we commit ourselves again into your hands we commit the reading of the world we also commit the preaching and the hearing of the world but Lord you may speak to our hearts and Lord you may guide our brothers and sisters today to live a life that will bring Glory when I Love You Lord and we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus yet you say wherefore because the Lord has been witnessed between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom though has dealt treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenants and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take it to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youths for the Lord the god of Israel says that he hated putting away for one covereth violence With His Garment says the Lord of hosts they are foretake it to your spirit that you deal not treacherously is I'm not hearing myself well I don't I hope I'm loud enough brother Ben can you hear me okay that's fine praise the name of our Lord so I want to preach on the text and I believe by 3 30 we shall be done I want to preach on the text which says God is a witness in your marriage God is a witness so now the Bible has told us chapter 2 and verse 14. that God has been a witness between Jonah and Agnes praise the name of Allah and then some of us who are married we can also attest to the same thing that God has been a witness between you as a husband your wife God has been a witness praise the name of our Lord God I wonder the way brother Jonah was appreciating ugliness somebody living all the way in Cliffy and then here the girl is living this side how did they meet one another year how did how did they know that maybe there is somebody here yeah [Music] yeah in the cliff there are many sisters over there and then Jonah comes from Mumbai area even invalid there are many sisters and what is interesting Jonah from Mumbai you know has come this way to pick a wife but they are two brothers I can tell you about they have also gone to Mumbai to pick wives from Mumbai then you would start wondering why didn't he Jonah didn't pick from Mumbai and then the brothers coming from here are going to pick from Mumbai praise the name of our Lord so you start wondering why but there is something that God made that even when Jonah is incliffe is not comfortable if he doesn't hear from Magnus who is this side so now you can imagine maybe the first day they met somewhere I don't know oh maybe Jonah was told about Agnes we don't know I didn't get time to find out from them what happened all of women in the whole world why Agnes but God says I want a witness the first day you started imagining about ugness and then you started thinking how can I get her phone number how can I find where she lives all those thoughts I was a witness foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh if we can meet somewhere and then she gets to know oh you are interested maybe on the phone conversation or text messages God says I was a witness praise the name of our Lord maybe the first time he came to meet the family members to express your interests that you know I'm interested [Music] God says he wants a witness now you see here the Bible has told us that let us take heed yet he had the residue of the spirit that he might seek a Godless therefore take it to your spirit and let none do tarantulas against the wife of his youth praise the name of Allah so the scripture is let us watch out again there is about our human Spirit you know like God has made us you know outside is the body that we are seeing but inside there is a human spirit and that human spirit is what makes this body alive so when a person dies it is the human spirit that lives so you are remaining with the body of the person but then the spirit has left and then you see that just as the body has got five senses [Music] smelling hearing feeling the five senses of the spirit [Music] and then the human spirit got the sense of imagination [Music] now it is now through that human spirit that you start developing feelings for one another praise the name of our Lord so now the Bible is take heed to your spirit because the spirit dictates over the body if the spirit has affection of football um and then he put the logo of money City on the shadow and then now the kid was running away from the shadow but then the logo of Arsenal was on the kid and then the log of money was on the Shadows that one is a real football fan who loves money City because they're imagining things they have affection of these things they are taken by these things and so when you have affection over something then you'll find that you are spending time in that scene with that students like somebody who loves football when they buy a newspaper they don't start from the front they go to the back [Music] these people have not put football when they are listening to the radio for them the time when the news are getting over again all around me today or in the evening they have the passion for it even when they go to this kind of places for films as if he sits in the boardroom to make decisions but he has the affection for that thing now here what comes to marriage you must have affection for your wife you must have affection for your husband foreign [Music] [Music] you know violence or domestic violence over I mean it's not only physical okay you know but there are different forms of violence or abuses but it can be mental you know the way you conduct around you're not you're saying I've never beaten my wife how about mistreating foreign [Music] and you're not being treacherous is your you are devising some techniques or you do something together into a trap but you might remember this happened now this one you're not going to do it you know you are not open from your heart to do what is right to do what is right before the Lord so God says I am a witness praise the name of Allah what your thoughts are what are your thoughts about your wife what are your thoughts about your husband God says I am a witness praise the name of Allah so my brother and my sister as you get into this journey of being married foreign Genesis chapter 10 verse 8. and the Lord said it is not good that man should be alone I'll make him and help meet for him but now when you read in the scriptures in Genesis chapter 1. when the god that made everything he said it is good and at the end of the everything he said and God so that everything is good in Genesis chapter 1 verse 30. and to every beast of the verse 31 rather and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth this day praise the name of our Lord God said everything is very good but now when he brings Adam and then he says it is not good foreign thank you praise the name of Allah he says it is not good praise the name of Allah so then you start wondering I will make him a help me now God said it is not good that man should not be alone so he had made the man and man was very good but when he looked at man in the as he had put him together it was not good for that man to be alone now let me ask you a question you mean Adam was alone on us you mean there were no Angels was God not there where animals God was there animals and Adam would give names to the animals but now God was looking for companionship foreign but then we see what's happening in some of God said it's not good there is no better wife you can get than your current wife yes if you are married there is no better husband you can have than your current husband and they should be the same thing with John and Agnes there is no better wife God will never give you the ugliness there is no better houses that God could give you so cherish one another name no wonder what the Bible says Rejoice with the wife of your years don't start looking for another in old age the wife of your use that's what the scripture says he says why have you done treacherously with the wife of your youths and God says I want a witness praise the name of our Lord let us go to the Book of Proverbs Proverbs Chapter 5 Verse 18. praise the name of our Lord five and then 18. he says let thine fountains be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth yes praise the name of Allah he's saying rejoice with the wife of your youth so you see that Adam to get a wife God had to get a portion of his body and even today if one wants to get a wife it's only God who knows who your right person is like the distance our brothers travel those away together maybe it would have been cheaper to get a wife and maybe it would have been easier to get a wife but because you are getting a hell of meat you are ready to count the coast praise the name of our Lord ready to go the last time because you want to get a wife of your years in Proverbs Chapter 19 Verse 14. praise the name of Allah the scripture says house and reaches at the inheritance of fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the Lord praise the name of our Lord houses and riches your parents but if you want a wife go to the make of wives praise the name of our Lord and we don't have a school of wives around praise the name of our Lord so you go to the maker of wise if you want a husband go to the make of husbands so the Bible says houses and riches but to get a Prudent Wife foreign [Music] foreign it's God who was a good husband it's God who has a good wife so if I'm a young woman and I want a good husband I need to be right with God because it's not no gifts so make sure that you are good before because the right person because the Bible says does not get children is food and then he gives it actually to dogs does not get precious powers and he gives it to pigs so you find yourself are you are you food and if you were past you are given to actually the people who value you okay you are given to the children but if you are swine God cannot give you something and the Bible says they will deceive they will also be the same way so the more you deceive welcome more remember the more you get one who is smarter than you to deceive you know so if you are not right you may play being smart until you get a young man or a young woman to be your husband or your wife but then I will get into your house and then you start realizing how did I get you foreign and the universe for a Canada coconut and he answered and said unto them have you not read that that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female the adamant and he said for this course shall a man live father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they trying shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more trying but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder or whatever and they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so much so Christ is telling us God made them male and female at the beginning and when he made them male and female he joined them they became one flesh change the name of Allah and so now when you are one flesh the Bible has told us God hates putting away God doesn't desire issues of divorce in marriage and that's why you made the voice till death do we pass and now you see when at the beginning when you're starting your marriage because of your love for your wife you will seriously meet me together you are meaning what you are saying but now down there maybe after some years you start looking around for options that's hardiness of heart and the Bible says because of hardness of Hearts no forgiving one another not being kind to one another no bearing with one another then you find a home that was of Love is complaining all the time what a family we need to get rid of hardness of Hearts the Bible says Be Kind to watch one another the book of First Peter chapter 3. praise the name of Allah and then we go and read in verse eight Nana finally be all of One mind having compassion one over another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous you know there are two words that I read and I was like hey this is interesting this one in verse 7. likewise dwell with your wives now when we're done reading chapter two yeah where we have red so me Mala chapter 2. and then verse 15. he says and they did not make one he had the residue of the spirit where for one that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirits against the wife of his years so in Mala chapter 2 verse 15. is saying don't deal akovanti foreign he says likewise your husbands dwell with your wife you know there is a difference between dealing and dwelling praise the name of our Lord you know to dwell or Cuba you can dread with the chicken cocoa foreign [Music] is because there are some points of weakness there are some points of failure when I'm going to fall down that's when I need yourself and that's why you should stand with your husband and your wife in their points of weaknesses that's being a True Companion what is the name of Allah not looking at a superstar praise the name of Allah maybe a man with a big chest forms and then he said that or now he's my husband supposing when he's sick is he still your husband so the Bible has told us big courteous be pitiful don't render evil for evil all railing foreign [Music] Lord deliver me from this kind of foreign and verse 12 and 13. this is the Book of Esther chapter 2. and then verse 12. now whenever made this time was come to go into king ahasuelas after that she had been 12 years 12 months according to the manner of women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wait six months with oil of Mara and six months with sweet orders and with other things for purifying of the women foreign then thus came every Maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given how to go with her out of the house of the women and to the King's house praise the name of Allah so we see here that the virgins were given things for purification six months of Mara and six months of sweet orders you know they were bearing purified to stand pure before the king okay and you also as a husband and wife praise the name of our Lord if you get any form of impurities Spirit of murmuring Spirit of hatred Spirit of not forgiving one another praise the name of Allah you also need to do a cleansing and what cleanses Us Praise the name of our Lord in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 26. the Bible says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing Water by the world have the word of God in your home praise the name of Allah as a husband obey the word of God as a wife obey the word of God and your obedience to the word of God we will cleanse you from any form of evil Souls when you keep the word of God in your life keep the word of God in your heart keep the word of God at your home and then it will keep you pure and as long as you are keeping the word of God then you are invoking the blessing of God to be continuously in your mind and as you go through marriage there are challenges in life but regardless of the challenges that you get in life our God has promised us that is a present help very present hello any trouble praise the name of our Lord whatever troubles that you have call upon the name of the Lord whatever challenges and say Lord you have joined us together and you know that this trouble was coming come and give us the comfort that we need in this church don't put God away from your marriage praise the name of Allah let God start your marriage let God dwell in your marriage and let God bring your marriage to conclusion praise the name of Allah a present help foreign gracefully together because of What the Lord Has Done foreign don't think one day I can do away with her I don't need to call her I don't need to communicate I don't need to talk to her no you can't be alone that's why you've picked up for your wife and God said praise the name of Allah it's not good for man to be alone but I'll make him praise the name of Allah and some of us who have been married if you are thinking about letting go of your wife the Bible says it's not good and the Bible says God hates divorce so you just need to go and reconcile please forgive me
