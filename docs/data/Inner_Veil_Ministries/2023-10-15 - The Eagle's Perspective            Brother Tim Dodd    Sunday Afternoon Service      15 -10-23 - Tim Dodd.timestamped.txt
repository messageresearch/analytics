[46:12] chapter chapter
[46:14] 6
[46:16] verse and when he had opened the fourth
[46:19] seal that's the lamb opening the seal
[46:22] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[46:24] heard the voice
[46:26] not of the lamb but of the fourth Beast
[46:29] the eagle say come and
[46:38] see and I looked beh and behold a Pale
[46:41] Horse and his name that sat on him was
[46:44] death and Hell Followed With Him and
[46:47] power was given unto them over the
[46:49] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[46:51] sword and with hunger and with death and
[46:54] with the beasts of the Earth
[47:13] amen the Lord add his Blessing to the
[47:14] word you may have your
[47:18] seats now we dealt this morning with the
[47:20] four
[47:23] anointings coming in their season
[47:27] but we have come to the end
[47:29] time how many believe we're in the end
[47:33] time it's not the events of the age that
[47:36] ushered in the end
[47:40] time it's not not the world governments
[47:43] that ushered in the end
[47:47] time it's not the United Nations that
[47:50] ansers in the world the end
[47:53] time there is one thing
[47:56] it is the opening of the seals that
[47:59] ushers in the end
[48:03] time so there is a people on the
[48:06] Earth who have caught the
[48:09] Revelation that the lamb has opened the
[48:13] seals and they know it is the end
[48:17] time the rest of the world doesn't know
[48:20] what time it
[48:22] is but we know what time it is
[48:26] amen we have received God's Vindicated
[48:31] Prophet we're not living under the lion
[48:35] anointing we're not living under the the
[48:37] ox
[48:39] anointing we're not living under the man
[48:42] anointing the opening of the
[48:45] seals or loose the eagle anointing into
[48:48] the
[48:50] church to bring forth the events of the
[48:53] end time
[48:58] we have been
[48:59] anointed every believer since the Acts
[49:03] chapter 2 has been
[49:07] anointed and we cannot but respond to
[49:10] the anointings that is sent into the
[49:16] church the church can only do what the
[49:19] anointing makes them
[49:22] do amen put up the slides for me if you
[49:25] you
[49:27] would all right and I want to just go
[49:29] quickly through some quotes of brother
[49:34] brandham is that
[49:37] okay amen a few of you will enjoy it the
[49:40] rest of you can enjoy can
[49:43] watch I want to speak tonight on the
[49:45] Eagles
[49:50] perspective so now here we are what we
[49:52] read this
[49:54] morning the Martyrs down Through the
[49:56] Ages suffered
[50:03] terribly but what were
[50:06] they they were under the inspiration the
[50:09] spirit of God the
[50:15] power you notice the last
[50:17] sentence How could a man do anything
[50:20] else besides the power of God that had
[50:23] been released to them
[50:29] Jesus said in Acts chapter
[50:31] one you shall receive power after the
[50:34] Holy Ghost has come upon
[50:36] you that's all they knew they didn't
[50:40] know it would be a lion
[50:42] anointing they didn't know it would be a
[50:44] ox
[50:45] anointing they didn't know a man
[50:47] anointed would come after
[50:49] that and they didn't know it would be
[50:51] the eagle anointing in your
[50:54] day
[50:56] but God has finished the
[50:59] mystery the power that was sent in every
[51:03] age corresponds to the anointing around
[51:06] the
[51:07] [Music]
[51:09] throne and he says if God sends a
[51:12] certain Spirit amongst them that's the
[51:14] only thing that's the only thing I'll
[51:17] say it again that's the only thing they
[51:19] can work by is the spirit that works
[51:22] among
[51:24] them
[51:31] it's not what you want to do it's not
[51:34] your idea it's not my
[51:37] idea God has a
[51:39] purpose and he sends an anointing upon
[51:42] the
[51:43] church and we have come in these last
[51:46] days to the last
[51:48] anointing has to get the church ready
[51:50] for a
[51:53] Rapture the lion anointing did not get
[51:56] the church ready for a
[51:58] Rapture the ox anointing was not for the
[52:02] Rapture the man anointing was not for
[52:05] the
[52:06] Rapture those prepared people for a
[52:11] resurrection but this anointing that has
[52:15] come in this hour is to prepare you for
[52:18] a body
[52:20] chain amen it had to be a different
[52:24] anointing
[52:26] because this is the hour of the fullness
[52:28] of
[52:31] adoption the hour of the the Redemption
[52:34] of our mortal
[52:38] bodies isn't it what our bodies were not
[52:41] redeemed in any other
[52:44] Age come on our bodies are redeemed in
[52:48] this
[52:49] age the fullness of
[52:52] adoption the change of these bodies
[52:55] the C Gene within
[52:57] you says I cannot manifest
[53:01] myself I am constrained by this
[53:04] [Music]
[53:06] body but one day at the last Trump in a
[53:10] moment in the twinkling of an
[53:12] eye this Mortal will put on
[53:16] immortality hallelujah hallelujah the
[53:19] seed Gene within
[53:21] us will say now I can do what I have
[53:23] always believed
[53:27] hallelujah
[53:28] hallelujah glory to God this is the hour
[53:33] give the next one now will prove to you
[53:37] by the history of the church and by the
[53:38] opening of the
[53:42] seals and the powers that let
[53:45] loose let me just read that again if
[53:49] we're going to prove by the opening of
[53:51] the
[53:52] seals that means the seals are open
[53:58] amen watch exactly the church responds
[54:01] to the
[54:05] anointing it couldn't do nothing
[54:12] else Easter
[54:14] seal Jesus so full of quickening
[54:19] power said if you can destroy this
[54:22] Temple that you took 40 years you
[54:24] thought to build I'll raise it up in
[54:26] three
[54:32] days why did Jesus say
[54:35] that he knew what the true temple of God
[54:40] was it wasn't the building they were
[54:43] looking
[54:44] at it was the Temple of his
[54:48] body in him dwell the fullness of
[54:52] God he knew what the word said he
[54:56] was and he had perfect faith in that
[55:01] word amen give me the next one do you
[55:05] know that you're the one the Bible
[55:07] speaks
[55:08] of hello hello do you know your position
[55:12] in
[55:14] Christ if you're in Christ you're a new
[55:18] creature do you know this
[55:22] word is just like every day living to
[55:27] you it's yours you're an
[55:31] eagle that's your
[55:33] food man shall not live by bread
[55:36] alone man shall not live by bread
[55:40] alone but by every word that proceeds
[55:43] out of the mouth
[55:46] of Jesus knew who he was the bride knows
[55:51] who she
[55:54] is
[55:55] I'm going to take you to the message
[55:57] perfect
[55:58] Faith now the
[56:01] disciples had had been given
[56:04] power and to heal the sick cast out
[56:08] devils and a man brought his
[56:11] [Music]
[56:14] son and they couldn't heal him and Jesus
[56:18] came and said why trouble you these
[56:22] men he said I brought my son
[56:25] and they couldn't heal
[56:27] him and and Sir can you help
[56:30] me Jesus said I can if you
[56:36] believe amen are you ready for this
[56:39] one he says Lord I
[56:43] believe help thou my
[56:47] unbelief now what he saying is Lord I
[56:53] believe
[56:56] [Music]
[57:00] he's saying I
[57:02] believe but I have a lack of
[57:07] faith you see that's the problem with
[57:09] the church as you see just a
[57:12] moment do Jesus gave the disciples the
[57:18] power but the problem wasn't the
[57:21] power the problem was their lack of
[57:24] faith
[57:26] this man was a
[57:28] Jew he saw them pray for other
[57:31] people other people were healed he
[57:35] brought his son to
[57:36] them heal my
[57:39] son but nothing
[57:41] happened and and they turned to
[57:44] Jesus Jesus said if you believe all
[57:46] things are
[57:49] possible he says I Lord I I'm believing
[57:52] with all the faith I have
[57:58] see the problem is I don't have enough
[58:05] Faith you see faith is not
[58:13] believing Here We Go
[58:17] Again believing is the action you take
[58:21] with your faith which is a
[58:23] substance
[58:28] [Music]
[58:32] you see you can't you can
[58:36] believe but if you don't have
[58:40] faith belie do anything all right I need
[58:44] to set an example here I was thinking
[58:46] about
[58:49] this I
[58:52] believe if I touch this pulpit
[58:56] if I touch this
[58:59] Pulpit that my body will be made
[59:08] Immortal see you can believe anything
[59:10] you
[59:13] want that doesn't make it
[59:18] happen all right why there's no faith or
[59:23] revelation behind that
[59:30] believing see there's no promise in the
[59:34] word that says touch the
[59:37] pulpit and you'll be
[59:41] changed because faith comes by hearing
[59:44] the
[59:47] word I can get
[59:50] emotional I could
[59:52] scream I could fast
[59:55] I could lay my hands I could stay here
[59:58] day and
[1:00:00] night nothing's going to
[1:00:02] happen because there's no
[1:00:05] promise our faith is established in the
[1:00:10] promises when it's revealed to
[1:00:13] you the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:00:16] against
[1:00:18] [Music]
[1:00:19] it so touching the pulpit won't change
[1:00:22] my body
[1:00:25] by receiving the end time
[1:00:28] message being Anointed with the end time
[1:00:32] anointing has a promise that this body
[1:00:36] shall be
[1:00:38] changed Hallelujah
[1:00:42] huj Lord I
[1:00:44] believe by faith in the revealed word of
[1:00:49] God it must come to
[1:00:52] pass the gates of hell cannot Prevail
[1:00:55] against
[1:00:57] it it's thus saith the
[1:01:00] Lord God keeps his
[1:01:04] word hallelujah
[1:01:07] hallelujah all right now let's get into
[1:01:10] it now remember they had the power Jesus
[1:01:13] had given them the
[1:01:16] power to heal the sick to raise the dead
[1:01:19] to cast out
[1:01:22] Devils just a few few days before
[1:01:26] that they had the power but not the
[1:01:28] faith to use the
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:34] power think about it they had the
[1:01:38] power they had the
[1:01:40] power they had the power but the power
[1:01:44] without faith is
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:51] useless next
[1:01:53] one
[1:01:55] now there's brandom
[1:01:58] Tabernacle there's the
[1:02:00] church the bride
[1:02:03] today the holy spirit is here with the
[1:02:08] power the power that's going to produce
[1:02:10] the resurrection is
[1:02:13] here the power that's going to change
[1:02:15] your body is
[1:02:17] here it's anointing
[1:02:20] you you got if you got the Holy
[1:02:23] Spirit
[1:02:26] if you have the Holy Spirit you have
[1:02:29] enough power in
[1:02:30] you to speak worlds into
[1:02:34] existence and go and live on
[1:02:37] them but it's governed by a
[1:02:41] law not a law of dos and
[1:02:45] don'ts it's a law of Faith or
[1:02:50] Revelation as much as the Lord will
[1:02:53] reveal to you
[1:02:56] that's how much power you can
[1:02:59] move now the Holy Spirit brother bandam
[1:03:02] says is here with the
[1:03:05] power but you haven't got the faith to
[1:03:07] move
[1:03:10] it resurrection power is
[1:03:14] here body change power is
[1:03:18] here all the power of the word is
[1:03:22] here but it takes faith to move
[1:03:26] it when the seals were
[1:03:29] opened catch oh Lord open our
[1:03:33] eyes when the seals were
[1:03:36] open the power the
[1:03:39] anointing the eagle of the last days was
[1:03:43] loosed upon the
[1:03:45] church it's here
[1:03:49] now but it can only be moved by
[1:03:53] revelation
[1:03:59] now he said Jesus had faith in the word
[1:04:02] of God that said what he
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] was it's written of
[1:04:12] me didn't David in the
[1:04:16] Psalms and the prophets and all of them
[1:04:19] speak of
[1:04:21] him I am the bread of life that come
[1:04:23] from God out of
[1:04:27] Heaven I am the Tree of Life from the
[1:04:29] Garden of
[1:04:32] Eden I am all these
[1:04:34] things I am that I
[1:04:38] am see the Jews came to
[1:04:41] Jesus and said our fathers did eat man
[1:04:43] in the
[1:04:46] wilderness shadows and
[1:04:49] types Jesus said I am that bread that
[1:04:53] came down from
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:57] Heaven your fathers did eat mana and are
[1:05:02] dead but whoever eats my flesh and drink
[1:05:05] my blood shall never
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:09] perish he says this is the bread that
[1:05:11] your father
[1:05:14] gives he looked at
[1:05:16] Abraham Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:05:20] my and before Abraham was I am
[1:05:26] hallelujah hallelujah he knew what the
[1:05:28] word said he
[1:05:29] was he took his place in the
[1:05:33] word that's why he could say destroy
[1:05:35] this
[1:05:36] temple in three days I'll raise it
[1:05:40] up because the word
[1:05:43] said I'll not suffer my Holy One to seek
[1:05:48] corruption I'll not leave his soul in
[1:05:51] Hell hallelujah hallelujah he knew the
[1:05:55] promise listen do you know your
[1:05:58] promise the Lord shall descend with a
[1:06:01] shout amen do we have the
[1:06:05] shout not shouting
[1:06:07] out the shout is a
[1:06:10] message to gather his people
[1:06:13] together in the revealing of Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ for
[1:06:18] their amen amen remember Jesus had faith
[1:06:22] in the word yes I know
[1:06:25] go ahead he knew that with that a
[1:06:29] perfect faith that he was the anointed
[1:06:35] Messiah that the spirit of God was upon
[1:06:38] him he said now I myself do nothing but
[1:06:42] it's my faith in
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:47] God and God was in
[1:06:50] him the word made
[1:06:53] manifest
[1:06:55] and when the word comes in
[1:06:58] you hallelujah
[1:07:01] hallelujah it's made
[1:07:04] manifest for you are a
[1:07:08] Believer and a Believer is the faith of
[1:07:12] God that moves in
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:17] you that's what you are you are the the
[1:07:21] believer is the Revelation that has been
[1:07:24] loose to
[1:07:29] him not the
[1:07:31] emotion not the
[1:07:33] memory being able to memorize the
[1:07:37] message being able to memorize the
[1:07:40] scriptures it's not about that it's what
[1:07:43] is revealed to
[1:07:45] you you are what is revealed to
[1:07:49] you you are what is revealed to
[1:07:52] you there's a
[1:07:55] that God is
[1:07:57] revealing to show you who you
[1:08:01] are hallelujah hallelujah we need to
[1:08:04] digest
[1:08:12] this because the revelation of the
[1:08:16] CG is the revelation of the power within
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:21] you and the revelation of the power
[1:08:24] loses the power to
[1:08:28] you you'll see this as we go
[1:08:32] forward all right we better keep going
[1:08:35] here but Jesus lived in a world that no
[1:08:37] one knowed
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:41] about he was an odd
[1:08:45] person he lived in a world of perfect
[1:08:50] faith in a perfect
[1:08:52] God in which he
[1:08:56] was you do you believe
[1:09:00] that how many believe
[1:09:02] that Jesus lived in a world that nobody
[1:09:07] knowed
[1:09:10] about he lived in a world of perfect
[1:09:14] faith in the perfect
[1:09:17] God in which he
[1:09:19] was he wasn't trying to
[1:09:22] be as I said this morning the Bible is
[1:09:26] not who you want to
[1:09:28] be the Bible is who you
[1:09:31] are and God is just taking away your
[1:09:36] unbelief line upon
[1:09:39] line taking away your man-made
[1:09:42] ideas taking away Creeds and
[1:09:45] dogmas because it's Creeds and dogmas
[1:09:48] that bind the power of the Holy
[1:09:51] Spirit and little by little
[1:09:54] well listen God has sent a supernatural
[1:09:58] message the word by the mouth of a
[1:10:02] prophet not something new but this Bible
[1:10:07] revealed we're standing with the Bible
[1:10:09] that's been
[1:10:11] revealed that's the power of the Life In
[1:10:15] You by the new birth can be loosed upon
[1:10:20] the Earth and produce a resurrection
[1:10:24] and produce a body
[1:10:26] change and produce a perfect
[1:10:30] overcoming this is who Jesus
[1:10:34] wasc if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:10:41] Christian to what we
[1:10:44] are we would be a Mystic to the
[1:10:49] world the people wouldn't understand
[1:10:52] you you'd walk in the
[1:10:55] spirit what the spirit said you would
[1:11:00] do what it forbid you'd not
[1:11:03] do amen so what you do and what you
[1:11:06] don't do is based on the spirit leading
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:11] you therefore there is therefore now no
[1:11:16] condemnation who walk after to those who
[1:11:18] walk after the
[1:11:20] spirit and not after the flesh
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:28] oh come on this flesh tells
[1:11:32] me this flesh tells
[1:11:35] me I'm 60 years
[1:11:41] old but that's not going to hinder
[1:11:46] me because Beyond this flesh is an
[1:11:49] eternal seed
[1:11:52] dream
[1:11:55] this flesh tells
[1:11:57] me I am the son of Gerald and Dorothy
[1:12:05] do but my C Gene tells me I'm the Son of
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:12] God now you can choose to walk after the
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:17] flesh or you can walk after the
[1:12:21] spirit there is no condemn
[1:12:24] Nation to them that walk after the
[1:12:28] spirit you see brother brandham was led
[1:12:30] of the
[1:12:32] spirit to go and preach to the
[1:12:35] Pentecostal but his
[1:12:39] mother-in-law his
[1:12:41] wife influenced him not to follow the
[1:12:45] leading of the
[1:12:48] spirit it cost his wife it cost child
[1:12:54] why because it brought
[1:12:57] condemnation he was in the wrong
[1:13:00] place but he was still a Son of
[1:13:03] God and God corrected his
[1:13:06] servant and sent him out so we could
[1:13:10] have this
[1:13:12] message hallelujah hallelujah see if you
[1:13:16] l no we're not done yet you and you'd be
[1:13:19] a Mystic person to
[1:13:22] them
[1:13:24] the world won't understand
[1:13:26] you why because the thing the mind of
[1:13:30] man cannot comprehend the mind of
[1:13:35] God the things of God are spiritually
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] discerned hallelujah hallelujah go ahead
[1:13:45] next one that's the way it is to all
[1:13:50] [Music]

[1:15:18] greatest
[1:15:20] message that this world has ever

[1:15:29] other by the
[1:15:32] flesh I'm not

[1:15:36] Canadian I'm a brother to Jesus
[1:15:41] Christ I'm a joined
[1:15:44] Heir I have a right to the
[1:15:47] promises this is not brother bram's
[1:15:50] message this is not Joseph brandham
[1:15:55] message listen we can't understand one
[1:15:57] another by the
[1:16:02] flesh Joseph
[1:16:04] brandham Billy Paul brandham Rebecca
[1:16:08] brandham Sarah brandham thank you they

[1:16:30] hallelujah this message is not after the
[1:16:34] flesh we only know each other by the
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:40] spirit that's that's why Paul even said
[1:16:43] we hereby know know not one another by
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:50] flesh he went further and said
[1:16:52] henceforth we don't don't even know
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ by the
[1:16:57] flesh why because all believers are
[1:17:01] Mystics to the

[1:17:07] word says they
[1:17:10] are hallelujah

[1:17:20] substance
[1:17:22] faith isolated from the entire
[1:17:26] world and becomes a new creature in
[1:17:29] Christ it doesn't matter what they're
[1:17:31] doing there it doesn't matter what
[1:17:34] they're doing there God has revealed to
[1:17:37] me
[1:17:39] personally that's why there's nobody
[1:17:41] that can stand behind the
[1:17:44] pulpit and say if you don't believe this
[1:17:46] message for this
[1:17:48] Revelation you're not going to make
[1:17:51] it no man can tell
[1:17:54] you what to believe and not to
[1:17:57] believe because no man can give
[1:18:02] Revelation but we preach the full
[1:18:04] counsel of
[1:18:06] God that God might reveal himself to
[1:18:10] you personally that you might walk by
[1:18:14] faith substance Faith isolates you from
[1:18:18] the
[1:18:19] world a new creature in
[1:18:21] Christ then brother ryom says now you're
[1:18:25] getting into bride

[1:26:04] testimonies God responds to
[1:26:09] Faith there was a boy in our
[1:26:13] church he played ice hockey ice hockey

[1:26:21] is
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:25] and he took a shot right in the

[1:26:33] piece of
[1:26:37] rubber rubber rubber do you know what
[1:26:39] rubber is like a
[1:26:42] tire all right and they can shoot it at
[1:26:45] 100 miles an
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:51] hour
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:56] and it hit him in the
[1:26:57] chest and he was having
[1:27:00] troubles and he would it would cause him
[1:27:04] pain the doctor didn't know what it
[1:27:07] was wasn't a broken
[1:27:10] bone but something went
[1:27:14] wrong and they came into the
[1:27:16] church wasn't a
[1:27:18] service but it was between services
[1:27:24] and they said brother Tim could you pray
[1:27:26] for
[1:27:27] him so I took him in the
[1:27:31] sanctuary and I took the anointing oil
[1:27:34] and I I anointed him with
[1:27:36] oil and I prayed the prayer of
[1:27:39] faith now listen this is his
[1:27:44] testimony he said as brother Tim
[1:27:47] prayed the pain got
[1:27:51] worse got
[1:27:53] worse not better
[1:27:56] worse he says and until and then brother
[1:27:59] Tim finished
[1:28:00] praying now listen when I finished
[1:28:03] praying I thought Lord I didn't feel a
[1:28:07] thing I didn't feel
[1:28:11] anything but Lord I know your word is
[1:28:15] true we have obeyed your
[1:28:17] word and before that boy left the
[1:28:20] sanctuary the pain complet completely
[1:28:26] left and he's been painfree ever
[1:28:33] since perfect faith in a perfect
[1:28:37] word has nothing to do with your
[1:28:42] feelings there was another boy he had
[1:28:46] hurt his
[1:28:47] shoulder do you know what dislocated
[1:28:49] shoulder
[1:28:51] means
[1:28:53] many times he had dislocated his
[1:28:56] shoulder he needed
[1:28:59] surgery and he he was believing for his
[1:29:04] shoulder and his
[1:29:06] testimony was brother Tim in the service
[1:29:09] when you were
[1:29:11] preaching I don't know what happened but
[1:29:14] I was thinking Lord I would sure love to
[1:29:16] raise my hands and worship
[1:29:20] you he says you said said
[1:29:23] something and when you said that he says
[1:29:26] something like an electric went into my
[1:29:31] shoulder hallelujah hallelujah says I
[1:29:33] didn't know what it was but all I know
[1:29:36] from that time forward I could raise my
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:41] arms hallelujah hallelujah we have a
[1:29:44] high praise we have a
[1:29:47] Healer we have a God that keeps his
[1:29:50] word
[1:29:53] amen now he has anointed the church in
[1:29:56] these last
[1:29:59] days to come to perfect faith and he's
[1:30:03] talking about
[1:30:08] everybody not the special
[1:30:10] preacher not the visiting
[1:30:13] Minister not the
[1:30:15] pastor
[1:30:17] everybody this is for
[1:30:20] everybody and so the Eagle anointing has
[1:30:23] come on the
[1:30:25] church and he's sent to combat the death
[1:30:29] power that's moving against this
[1:30:32] [Music]

[1:30:36] now now
[1:30:38] listen what is an
[1:30:40] eagle you know what an eagle
[1:30:43] is an eagle has long range
[1:30:49] Vision an eagle has two wings
[1:30:53] that it can fly higher than any other
[1:30:58] bird an eagle can separate itself from
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:05] world if you knew where the all the
[1:31:07] eagle does he sets his wings on the
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:13] wind I don't know if you understand
[1:31:15] where wind comes
[1:31:17] from but the wind comes from the sun he
[1:31:21] feing the
[1:31:25] earth and the greatest upcurrent for the
[1:31:33] Eagles is when the sun strikes exposed
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:44] rock that raises the eagle higher and
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:49] higher what is The Rock
[1:31:52] is the revelation of the word of
[1:31:55] God when the Sun Shines on the
[1:31:59] word it causes the Eagles to rise higher
[1:32:02] and
[1:32:04] higher the eagle has confidence in the
[1:32:07] wings that God gave
[1:32:11] it that it can fly away from its
[1:32:16] enemy one time brother Brandon was was
[1:32:19] in a storm in the mountains
[1:32:24] and as he's thinking as the sun broke
[1:32:26] through the clouds after the
[1:32:31] storm he's admiring the beauty of
[1:32:35] it and he starts worshiping
[1:32:39] God and there's a
[1:32:43] squirrel
[1:32:45] squirrel and the squirrel is going
[1:32:47] chatter chatter
[1:32:50] chatter you know that's that's what a
[1:32:51] squirrel does he's making
[1:32:54] noise and brother brandham thought the
[1:32:56] squirrel was making noise because he was
[1:32:58] worshiping
[1:33:01] God but he looked at the squirrel he
[1:33:05] says it's not upset about
[1:33:07] me he saw that there was an
[1:33:11] eagle that was standing near a
[1:33:14] tree that had been blown down in the
[1:33:20] storm now
[1:33:22] listen the eagle did not
[1:33:26] think I've been blown down in the
[1:33:29] storm I guess I just have to walk on the
[1:33:32] earth the rest of my
[1:33:38] days I've been in a
[1:33:40] storm and here I am on the
[1:33:43] earth and now I just have to walk on the
[1:33:47] earth like a
[1:33:49] lion like an ox
[1:33:52] like a man I'll just walk on the
[1:33:55] earth no that's not the way the eagle
[1:33:58] was
[1:34:00] made when the storm was
[1:34:02] over brother Ram say he just started to
[1:34:04] flex his
[1:34:07] wings he'd been given a different
[1:34:11] anointing he was not an Earthbound
[1:34:14] creature and so he be to flex his
[1:34:17] wings and when he got tired of the
[1:34:19] chatter chatter chatter of the world
[1:34:24] squirrel he just took a couple of
[1:34:28] flops set his
[1:34:30] wings on the Winds of faith and Rose up
[1:34:34] out of
[1:34:35] there Hallelujah
[1:34:39] hallu listen
[1:34:41] Eagle you might have been blown down in
[1:34:44] a
[1:34:45] storm you don't have to stay
[1:34:50] down this is not the lion
[1:34:53] age is not the man age this is not the
[1:34:57] ox age this is the eagle
[1:35:02] a hallelujah
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:09] hallelujah see God made the
[1:35:11] eagle and he Likens the eagle to
[1:35:15] himself he calls himself an
[1:35:18] eagle he calls His prophets Eagles
[1:35:22] and he says you are now under an eagle
[1:35:26] anointing the first three anointings
[1:35:28] were all
[1:35:31] Earthbound but this
[1:35:34] anointing has a higher
[1:35:38] perspective you are called to rise into
[1:35:40] a different
[1:35:43] perspective you will see what the lion
[1:35:50] saw
[1:35:52] I will restore sayith the
[1:35:54] Lord you'll see what the ox
[1:35:57] saw you'll see what the man
[1:36:00] saw but you'll rise above farther than
[1:36:03] naked
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:05] rise you're not limited to what they can
[1:36:12] see you see you have been
[1:36:15] anointed the power has been sent into
[1:36:17] the
[1:36:18] church to give us the perspective that
[1:36:21] prophets of old
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:25] had see what did prophets of old
[1:36:29] have when they came to
[1:36:32] worship there was Aaron Moses was up on
[1:36:36] the
[1:36:37] mountain and Aaron was down with the
[1:36:41] people and the people said Moses can't
[1:36:43] live this long on the
[1:36:47] mountain Aaron make us something to
[1:36:50] worship
[1:36:52] from a human
[1:36:54] perspective they worship the golden
[1:36:58] calf but while on the
[1:37:01] mountain Moses was seeing into Heavenly
[1:37:06] things and he was going to establish the
[1:37:09] people in Heavenly
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:15] worship he was sent to bring true
[1:37:17] worship to the
[1:37:20] people
[1:37:22] all right let's look at some of these
[1:37:24] prophetic examples for
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:30] us these prophets were Anointed with an
[1:37:33] eagle
[1:37:36] anointing listen the eagle flies in the
[1:37:40] heavenlies so that it can see the way
[1:37:43] God sees
[1:37:46] it that's what this is
[1:37:50] about
[1:37:52] God wants you to see yourself the way
[1:37:54] God sees
[1:37:58] you not the way man sees you not the way
[1:38:02] you see yourself but be anointed into
[1:38:05] the mind of
[1:38:07] Christ to see who you are in his
[1:38:11] thoughts because he wrote your name on
[1:38:13] the Lamb's Book of
[1:38:15] Life before the foundation of the
[1:38:18] world that's not a book that you turn
[1:38:20] pages
[1:38:23] let me see if I can find your name here
[1:38:26] uh just wait just wait let me see if
[1:38:28] you're here that's not it no the Lamb's
[1:38:32] Book of Life is the thoughts of God when
[1:38:35] God was
[1:38:39] alone that's why in John 1 when the
[1:38:41] logos comes into
[1:38:45] view the very thought and expression of
[1:38:49] God brother ROM says that's when the
[1:38:51] Lamb's Book of Life comes into
[1:38:55] view it's the beginning of
[1:38:58] creation it's the beginning of the
[1:39:01] expression of
[1:39:03] Jehovah and your name is written
[1:39:06] there I don't care what the Catholic
[1:39:08] Church thinks about
[1:39:11] me I don't care what the Baptist Church
[1:39:13] thinks
[1:39:14] about I don't care what the Pentecostal
[1:39:16] Church
[1:39:17] thinks I don't even care what this this
[1:39:20] church thinks
[1:39:23] I care what God thinks about
[1:39:26] me I want to know what he thinks about
[1:39:32] me you've been anointed to rise up into
[1:39:34] the thoughts of
[1:39:38] God
[1:39:40] Elijah Elijah there on Mount

[1:40:12] Baal up on the
[1:40:15] mountain is that right he says now you
[1:40:19] go
[1:40:19] ahead call on your God if your God is
[1:40:24] God let him answer by
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:28] fire uhhuh so Elijah sits
[1:40:36] back says go
[1:40:39] ahead if your God is
[1:40:41] God they start calling on their
[1:40:44] God he says hey call a little
[1:40:48] louder maybe your God's tired
[1:40:52] maybe he's
[1:40:54] busy maybe he needs a hearing
[1:40:59] aid call a little louder he sat there
[1:41:03] and watched them what were the prophets
[1:41:05] of Bale doing they were screaming they
[1:41:09] were shouting they were dancing they
[1:41:12] were cutting themselves they were doing
[1:41:15] everything they knew how to
[1:41:17] do to try and bring the presence of God
[1:41:23] but Elijah was
[1:41:25] anointed what is anointing it's not
[1:41:28] emotions it's supreme power in
[1:41:33] control knowing exactly what and
[1:41:37] how
[1:41:39] Hallelujah and so there he
[1:41:41] was the evening
[1:41:45] time says it's time for me to put the
[1:41:48] altar or put the altar in order
[1:41:53] and he took 12
[1:41:54] Stones the altar of
[1:41:57] Israel one for
[1:42:00] Judah one for
[1:42:02] Ephraim one for Dan what was he doing
[1:42:07] was taking the altar that was broken
[1:42:10] down and putting it back in
[1:42:13] order let me put it another
[1:42:16] way let me put it another way he was in
[1:42:21] the loose ends
[1:42:26] together that was his
[1:42:28] ministry he rebuilds the
[1:42:31] altar then he puts the sacrifice on the
[1:42:34] altar then he says bring
[1:42:37] water and they dug a trench around
[1:42:40] the now it had been a
[1:42:44] drought for three and a half
[1:42:46] years there had been no rain there was
[1:42:49] not a drop of moisture in that
[1:42:54] ground they kept pouring water on the
[1:42:57] sacrifice so much water that it filled
[1:43:00] up the
[1:43:02] ditch but before it filled up the ditch
[1:43:04] the ground had to become
[1:43:08] wet and more water and more water until
[1:43:12] finally the ditch filled
[1:43:14] up why because God had told him to do it
[1:43:19] this way
[1:43:21] now here's
[1:43:22] Elijah by Perfect faith in what the word
[1:43:25] said to
[1:43:28] do he said Lord let it be
[1:43:32] known that you are
[1:43:35] God and that I am your
[1:43:40] Prophet hallelujah hallelujah Elijah
[1:43:44] Anointed with an eagle anointing knew
[1:43:46] who he
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:49] was and the fire came out of
[1:43:52] heaven and struck the
[1:43:55] altar consumed the
[1:43:57] sacrifice consumed the
[1:43:59] water and even consumed the
[1:44:04] stone there was nothing but a bird spot
[1:44:07] left on the
[1:44:08] ground why CU Elijah knew who he
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:18] was
[1:44:19] now praise the Lord he gets a
[1:44:23] message we'll call it a text
[1:44:25] message he gets a text message from
[1:44:31] Jezebel you killed my
[1:44:34] prophets I'm going to kill
[1:44:36] you tomorrow by this time you'll be
[1:44:40] dead here's the mighty prophet of
[1:44:44] God knows who he
[1:44:46] is and he says God you didn't tell me
[1:44:49] this part
[1:44:52] and he
[1:44:54] runs he's
[1:44:56] scared why cuz that part was not
[1:44:59] revealed to
[1:45:00] him he's still
[1:45:04] human but he had no
[1:45:06] Revelation so he run into the
[1:45:09] Wilderness run away from
[1:45:11] Jezebel run to the cave he thought my
[1:45:15] life is
[1:45:16] over it's all
[1:45:19] finished and he's at the
[1:45:21] cave but he's still a prophet he still
[1:45:24] knows God he still knows who he is he
[1:45:28] might not feel
[1:45:30] anything but he's there waiting for
[1:45:35] God and an earthquake goes
[1:45:38] by and God is not in the
[1:45:41] earthquake and A Mighty Wind goes
[1:45:45] through he says no God's Not In The
[1:45:48] Wind cuz he's anointed
[1:45:51] and
[1:45:52] then a fire
[1:45:56] exactly fire he had just called fire
[1:45:59] from
[1:46:00] heaven now fire goes through he goes no
[1:46:03] God's not in the
[1:46:06] fire he knows his
[1:46:11] God hallelujah he knows his God he he
[1:46:16] knows what it is to be God's
[1:46:19] prophet Bible says a still Small
[1:46:23] Voice and Elijah wraps himself in his
[1:46:27] mantle and he goes to the
[1:46:31] cave and God speaks to him says what
[1:46:34] doest thou here
[1:46:36] Elijah he
[1:46:38] says you want me to read the scripture
[1:46:40] I'm just telling the
[1:46:42] story take that
[1:46:44] down I'm not going to read it word for
[1:46:47] word you go home and read your Bible
[1:46:52] but he says I have been jealous for the
[1:46:54] Lord my
[1:46:56] God they have slain all the
[1:46:59] prophets now I'm only one
[1:47:03] left and they threatened to take my life
[1:47:06] there's nobody in Israel except me who
[1:47:08] not b
[1:47:11] b and what does God
[1:47:14] do I brother Bram said it this way he
[1:47:18] pulled back the seals a little bit
[1:47:24] he showed him there were still 7,000
[1:47:26] that had
[1:47:28] not Hallelujah there was still a work to
[1:47:31] do
[1:47:32] Elijah it's not over yet we're Anointed
[1:47:36] with an eagle
[1:47:37] anointing to look for every last
[1:47:39] predestinated
[1:47:42] seed because we know who we
[1:47:44] are there's still another one that needs
[1:47:48] to know who they are
[1:47:52] amen God knows what he's doing let's
[1:47:55] look at another Prophet oh I love this
[1:47:59] story
[1:48:00] Elisha at
[1:48:08] Dar now
[1:48:11] Elijah had been telling King
[1:48:15] Ahab I think it was
[1:48:17] Ahab nevertheless he was telling the
[1:48:19] king of is
[1:48:21] Isel and saying don't go on this road
[1:48:24] because the syrians have an
[1:48:28] ambush and then a little while later
[1:48:30] he'd send another message to the
[1:48:35] king don't go over this way because the
[1:48:38] syrians are laying in wait for
[1:48:43] you and the king of Syria says what's
[1:48:45] going
[1:48:47] on there's a spy in our midst
[1:48:51] he says he says let's find out who the
[1:48:54] Spy
[1:48:55] is that's telling the king of Israel
[1:48:58] what we're
[1:48:59] doing and one of his servants
[1:49:02] says oh no King there's no
[1:49:06] spy Israel has a
[1:49:09] prophet and the prophet warns the
[1:49:12] king now
[1:49:14] listen the reason Israel is in the
[1:49:17] trouble it's in
[1:49:19] today is because they don't listen to
[1:49:21] their
[1:49:24] prophets there's a war going on over
[1:49:27] there there's a
[1:49:31] war and it's it was surprised to
[1:49:36] them when they were attacked because
[1:49:39] there was no Prophet to tell them what
[1:49:40] was going
[1:49:43] on but back in those days the King was
[1:49:47] listening to
[1:49:48] elishah so the the Syrian Army said the
[1:49:51] Syrian King says let's go get
[1:49:53] him and in the still of night they
[1:49:56] quietly surround the city of
[1:50:02] dotham and gesi gets up in the
[1:50:05] morning oh it's time to make
[1:50:08] coffee and he looks out the
[1:50:18] window hey
[1:50:21] help we're
[1:50:23] surrounded Elisha
[1:50:26] Elisha they we this city is surrounded
[1:50:29] we're in
[1:50:31] trouble we're going to
[1:50:33] die it's so
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:37] terrible and Elijah says oh don't
[1:50:40] worry says there's more with us than
[1:50:42] there is with
[1:50:47] them now just a minute here
[1:50:51] gesi was trying to
[1:50:55] believe okay I'll take your word for it
[1:50:59] Elisha but I can just imagine he's
[1:51:02] trembling still
[1:51:04] fearful still
[1:51:06] doubting he says how can that be there's
[1:51:09] more I can't see
[1:51:13] anybody and then Elisha says Lord open
[1:51:18] his eyes
[1:51:20] or in other words let him see what I
[1:51:25] see or in other words anoint him with
[1:51:28] the anointing that I am anointed
[1:51:33] with an eagle
[1:51:35] anointing and so El G's eyes come
[1:51:40] open and he sees that the hills are
[1:51:44] filled the Chariots of Fire angels of
[1:51:48] Fire SWS of
[1:51:54] fire listen now the fear that GES had
[1:51:58] was no
[1:52:02] more the doubts that gesi had were no
[1:52:08] more now listen listen
[1:52:11] closely nothing had
[1:52:17] changed nothing had changed
[1:52:20] those angels didn't just suddenly
[1:52:27] arrive they were already
[1:52:30] there when the a when the armies of
[1:52:32] Syria
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:34] came the Lord sent his
[1:52:37] army but gesi didn't see
[1:52:40] it and he
[1:52:42] feared but they were still
[1:52:45] there so what did it take it took his
[1:52:49] eyes coming
[1:52:51] open to be raised up to see what Elisha
[1:52:56] saw hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:53:00] circumstances never
[1:53:03] changed it was the Revelation that
[1:53:08] Chang hallelujah hallelujah when God
[1:53:11] reveals something to
[1:53:12] you it is a finished
[1:53:15] work the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:53:19] against
[1:53:21] that's why the eagle anointing is s in
[1:53:23] this
[1:53:25] hour to raise you
[1:53:27] above what the lion
[1:53:30] saw what the man saw what the arc saw if
[1:53:34] all we know was what was down through
[1:53:36] the church
[1:53:38] ages from the book of Acts to the
[1:53:42] Pentecostal we are fearful and
[1:53:48] doubtful but let go God let God take
[1:53:52] this Eagle anointing and anoint his
[1:53:55] church to see that it's already a
[1:53:58] finished
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:03] word oh it takes
[1:54:06] Revelation I was talking about Ruth
[1:54:10] yesterday how that you know when she
[1:54:12] went into
[1:54:14] Boaz and Boaz gave her six measures of
[1:54:18] barley
[1:54:20] and she went
[1:54:22] home and Naomi saw what she
[1:54:26] had she was carrying this load of
[1:54:32] barley and she said what what where did
[1:54:34] you get this
[1:54:37] barley and she said what did he
[1:54:40] say he said I'll do the
[1:54:43] work what did Naomi say see Ruth didn't
[1:54:48] understand but but she needed a
[1:54:51] revelation and so Naomi told
[1:54:53] her girl you can
[1:54:57] rest because he won't
[1:54:59] rest until he has finished the
[1:55:03] work hallelujah hallelujah I can see
[1:55:06] that he loves
[1:55:08] you it's God revealing that he always
[1:55:11] loved
[1:55:12] you that's what the Lamb's Book of Life

[1:55:35] you and there's never an end to his love
[1:55:38] for
[1:55:43] you hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:55:47] sometimes when I'm on the mission field
[1:55:51] I get feeling sorry for
[1:55:55] myself you know my children used to say
[1:55:57] Dad you have no
[1:56:02] sympathy I said that's not true I feel
[1:56:05] sorry for myself
[1:56:09] sometimes and sometimes when you're away
[1:56:12] from home for a long period of
[1:56:15] time you're missing your
[1:56:17] wife you're missing your family
[1:56:21] and you're you're just wishing you're at

[1:56:27] country of
[1:56:29] Ghana at a
[1:56:31] convention I had been in Tanzania and
[1:56:33] then I went over to
[1:56:37] Ghana and it was I think the last or
[1:56:39] second last day of the
[1:56:44] convention I was trying to
[1:56:46] study trying to pray
[1:56:50] and I got to praying Lord I'm sorry I

[1:58:18] Death
[1:58:20] combating the fighting against the death
[1:58:24] the one the Antichrist Called
[1:58:32] Death because death is in the
[1:58:37] land we've come to seed
[1:58:40] time when a plant comes to seed
[1:58:46] time the seed that went into the ground
[1:58:50] has come up through the different
[1:58:53] stages but when it comes to the seed the
[1:58:56] Harvest
[1:58:58] Time every part of the plant Must
[1:59:04] Die the shoot Must Die the stock Must
[1:59:08] Die the tosel Must Die the shock Must
[1:59:12] Die it must all die brother random even
[1:59:15] says about it that's the reason the
[1:59:17] Pentecostals are dying now
[1:59:22] because the age is
[1:59:26] here the word has been
[1:59:29] manifest the eagle
[1:59:31] time the time of the word to return
[1:59:36] back to restore the
[1:59:40] faith amen that's the time that we're
[1:59:43] living
[1:59:44] in now we're we're living in the hour
[1:59:47] where God has restored all things
[1:59:51] has brought this word into
[1:59:54] position has Anointed The Church of the
[1:59:56] last
[1:59:59] day it's time to
[2:00:02] receive it's time to
[2:00:05] accept it's time to
[2:00:07] believe it's time to let every fear and
[2:00:10] doubt Fall by the
[2:00:13] wayside that the anointing that God has
[2:00:16] sent upon the
[2:00:18] church
[2:00:19] listen I can prove it to you now by
[2:00:23] history exactly how it
[2:00:25] acts brother Bram in the seals couldn't
[2:00:28] use
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:31] history to prove the eagle
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:35] anointing because it was
[2:00:38] future but now we've come to the
[2:00:41] end most of it is
[2:00:44] history but there's one thing God's
[2:00:46] waiting
[2:00:47] for is for you to say Amen to every word
[2:00:51] of
[2:00:56] God you see because he hasn't just taken
[2:01:00] away our
[2:01:03] punishment he's taken away our
[2:01:07] guilt whom he
[2:01:09] forew he did
[2:01:11] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:01:13] image of his
[2:01:15] son is that
[2:01:17] you moreover whom he did
[2:01:20] predestinate then he also
[2:01:23] called whom he called he
[2:01:27] justified he
[2:01:29] justifies if he calls you he justifies

[2:02:04] of
[2:02:07] guilt and that's why every promise in

[2:02:15] mind listen the the circumstances
[2:02:18] haven't changed

[2:02:33] open that you see in the sight of
[2:02:37] God you bear no
[2:02:43] guilt if you stand here
[2:02:46] today and know with without a shadow of
[2:02:49] a doubt that I am
[2:02:53] Guiltless there's nothing the devil can
[2:02:55] do to
[2:02:59] you it's the devil that's lying to
[2:03:02] you he's trying to tell you you're
[2:03:06] nobody he's trying to tell you made too

[2:03:20] church the church couldn't do anything

[2:03:31] word is this not the very

[2:05:42] Justified moreover whom he has
[2:05:45] Justified he is already glorified
[2:05:49] in his eyes you're already sitting by
[2:05:53] his
[2:05:55] side for you are the Bride of
[2:06:10] Jesus he took your guilt
[2:06:13] away he the word took your guilt
[2:06:17] away there was woman in the Old
[2:06:19] Testament what a
[2:06:24] woman and if her husband was jealous of
[2:06:29] her accused her of committing
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:36] adultery but couldn't prove it if he
[2:06:39] could prove it she'd be
[2:06:43] stoned but he's got a jealous Spirit on
[2:06:47] him he accuses her of being
[2:06:51] unfaithful no matter how much she
[2:06:54] protested they could
[2:06:56] argue there could be Strife in the
[2:06:59] hall but he she could stand there and
[2:07:02] say I never did
[2:07:04] nothing he can say I don't believe
[2:07:07] you I don't believe
[2:07:09] you the word of God gave a a remedy for
[2:07:14] that in Numbers Chapter 5 we won't read
[2:07:18] read it you read it when you go
[2:07:21] home there was an oath that was
[2:07:24] made and the woman would have to agree
[2:07:27] to the
[2:07:28] oath and the priest would take the ashes
[2:07:31] of a
[2:07:33] sacrifice and he would write the words
[2:07:35] of the
[2:07:39] oath and he would take a
[2:07:41] sponge and he would D dip it in water
[2:07:44] and dip it on the
[2:07:47] ashes so now now that the words of the
[2:07:49] oath are in the
[2:07:52] water and he would put the water into
[2:07:55] the the
[2:07:57] cup now the words of the oath was if she
[2:08:01] was
[2:08:02] guilty the ashes would cause her thigh
[2:08:05] to
[2:08:07] rot cause her stomach to
[2:08:10] rot and she would die the words of the
[2:08:14] curse listen Jesus took your curse
[2:08:17] away
[2:08:19] but now listen to
[2:08:21] this she now had to take that
[2:08:25] water and drink that
[2:08:31] water and she say I I forget what the
[2:08:35] exact words
[2:08:37] are but you would have to say that she
[2:08:40] says Amen to the words of the
[2:08:46] curse now to a woman woman that was
[2:08:50] guilty that was a terrible
[2:08:53] thing she's
[2:08:55] hoping but the Bible's not
[2:08:58] true she's
[2:09:00] hoping that she won't die but she's
[2:09:05] guilty but if a woman is not
[2:09:08] guilty she can drink that
[2:09:13] water she can drink it down to the last
[2:09:17] drop
[2:09:21] this is good
[2:09:23] stuff I say Amen to every word of the
[2:09:27] curse why because she knows she's not
[2:09:32] guilty of the
[2:09:36] curse she knows the ashes will have no
[2:09:38] effect upon
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:46] her because now now what was Strife in
[2:09:51] her
[2:09:52] home now her innocence could be
[2:09:58] proven listen
[2:10:00] Saints Jesus took your guilt
[2:10:03] away you can now take the
[2:10:06] book and you can eat the book you can

[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:45] 16 now this one you can put up on the
[2:10:47] screen
[2:10:49] Jeremiah 15 and verse
[2:10:52] 16 I want you to see this
[2:10:55] verse thy words were
[2:10:58] found and I did eat
[2:11:01] them and Thy Word was unto
[2:11:04] me the joy and rejoicing of my
[2:11:11] heart Thy Word was
[2:11:14] found or we could say Thy Word was
[2:11:17] revealed
[2:11:19] and I did eat it and this message it's a
[2:11:23] rejoicing of my
[2:11:25] heart for I am called by thy
[2:11:30] name I have seen my name on the L's book
[2:11:33] of
[2:11:36] lifeu oh Lord God of
[2:11:39] hosts I have seen my
[2:11:42] name I have eaten your book and it
[2:11:45] causes a rejoicing in my life

[2:12:17] not changed

[2:12:23] atonement it's still the atonement of
[2:12:26] Calvary but what happened in this
[2:12:29] hour the power of the atonement was
[2:12:32] loosed by the full word being
[2:12:36] [Music]
[2:12:39] revealed hallelujah hallelujah we're
[2:12:42] standing in the age of the full

[2:12:55] you up and cause you to see
[2:12:59] yourself the way God sees

[2:13:07] Mary and said Mary you are that one that
[2:13:11] the scripture talks
[2:13:13] about a virgin shall
[2:13:16] conceive and Mary said be it unto me
[2:13:20] according to your
[2:13:22] word she couldn't make it
[2:13:27] happen she just
[2:13:29] believed I am the one the Bible's
[2:13:31] talking
