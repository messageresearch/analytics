[29:59] Praise the name of our Lord.
[30:02] Last Sunday I was in Camolei
[30:05] at Pastor S's church.
[30:08] I taken brother George Franklin there to
[30:10] minister.
[30:13] They sent greetings from Cami.
[30:16] Praise the name of the Lord. Then on
[30:18] Wednesday
[30:20] we also went to church.
[30:24] Pastor Charles Mu's church
[30:27] had also taken the visitor there to
[30:29] minister.
[30:31] They also send their greetings.
[30:33] Praise the name of our Lord. We keep our
[30:36] brother in prayers.
[30:39] Last Friday preached in Nakaso.
[30:42] Today's preaching also in Nakaso.
[30:46] Then on Wednesday's preaching at Zana.
[30:50] So I requested brother Cyrus
[30:53] on Thursday to go and pick him from.
[30:58] And I appreciate that he has a good car
[31:00] to do that.
[31:04] So I'm praying for more cars to come.
[31:08] Praise the name of our Lord.
[31:11] S that you don't only use your car for
[31:13] your family,
[31:16] for your business, but even the work of
[31:18] the king.
[31:20] Praise the name of our Lord. Even
[31:22] building good homes.
[31:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Why would
[31:27] we spend money in hotels
[31:30] when somebody has a good home?
[31:33] So, we're also praying for good homes.
[31:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Not only
[31:40] good house,
[31:42] but even the husband and wife and the
[31:44] children to be good.
[31:48] Praise your name, oh God. That's why you
[31:51] can find peace.
[31:54] The house may be good.
[31:56] But it's a prison.
[31:59] So you can't take there a visa.
[32:02] Praise the name of Lord. But in the
[32:04] house which is stable,
[32:07] then God can always visit that house.
[32:10] And those are the homes we are looking
[32:11] at.
[32:13] Praise the name over. So our pastor
[32:15] today is not around.
[32:17] He's preaching at brother Jeremas
[32:20] Church.
[32:22] Keep him in your prayers.
[32:25] Then we want to receive the children who
[32:26] came back from school.
[32:32] I see Benjamin
[32:34] &gt;&gt; and then others. We appreciate that you
[32:36] you're back.
[32:39] We have any visa coming here for the
[32:40] first time. If you can raise your hand
[32:41] for recognition,
[32:43] you're welcome. Our sister
[32:46] with you.
[32:48] Praise the name of our Lord. So this
[32:49] afternoon we shall have the youth
[32:51] meeting.
[32:53] Praise the name of our Lord. And I want
[32:55] to appreciate those who turned up for
[32:56] yesterday's meeting,
[33:00] praying and fasting.
[33:02] But our zeal is so low,
[33:08] very low.
[33:11] And these are the things of God,
[33:14] but we take them lightly.
[33:20] So we need to see that our zeal comes up
[33:25] and the more we have a zeal for the Lord
[33:28] is the more the Lord comes down in our
[33:30] lives
[33:32] and is the more the Lord fights our
[33:33] battles.
[33:35] You waste a lot of your time fighting
[33:37] your own battle without God.
[33:41] You'll run the whole year.
[33:47] But when you rely on the Lord,
[33:50] what you've taken 10 years,
[33:53] you can do it within less than a year.
[33:56] So we need that we we really take the
[33:58] things of God serious
[34:02] and then how the Lord will fight all
[34:03] these things that disturb you
[34:07] and you'll see how God is building a
[34:09] house.
[34:12] Praise the name of So on Sunday,
[34:16] this coming Sunday, we're going to have
[34:18] brother George Franklin preach here.
[34:22] He's a brother from Nigeria
[34:26] and he preached two services.
[34:29] So we shall have two services here. I'm
[34:32] expecting some people to be with us.
[34:36] So we shall have a meal together
[34:39] and I call upon your contribution.
[34:42] to brother Peter Aula.
[34:45] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[34:48] we spend about I think about 1 million
[34:50] to one and a half for food.
[34:56] 1 million to 1 million and a half
[34:59] for food.
[35:01] Praise the name of our Lord. And some of
[35:03] you that is just less than half of your
[35:05] salary.
[35:10] you come up and do that.
[35:13] Praise the name of

[35:18] to do it.
[35:20] If you don't do it, then who will do it?
[35:23] And when God blesses the other person
[35:26] then why would you think why God have
[35:28] you forgotten me?
[35:31] because you don't know where to put
[35:34] because it's more blessed to give
[35:37] but here you are giving not only to one
[35:39] person
[35:41] you're giving to many and you're giving
[35:44] to the kingdom I don't know how much
[35:46] blessings the lord will bless
[35:49] you we need to see that we own these
[35:50] burdens
[35:53] praise the name of let us own this
[35:55] burden
[35:56] like yesterday I received a message
[36:00] &gt;&gt; and then they were telling me that our
[36:03] internet subscription for for Wi-Fi has
[36:07] expired.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Now I had no option.
[36:18] I had to make sure that is renewed.
[36:23] But there are so many other needs which
[36:25] we have among the ministers
[36:29] which is always not brought to the
[36:30] people
[36:32] but then others have to see that they
[36:34] meet those costs.
[36:39] So let us see that we come up to support
[36:41] the work.
[36:43] Praise the name of our lord. All these
[36:45] many things actually which do happen
[36:48] but you see some few people share that
[36:51] burden.
[36:53] Let us also take interest
[36:56] in participating in the services of the
[36:58] Lord.
[37:00] Praise the name of our Lord. So I would
[37:01] call upon your contribution
[37:04] to that cause.
[37:06] And then there are also other new
[37:08] churches new members we get from
[37:10] different places.
[37:14] Sometimes they even cannot afford
[37:18] to transport themselves.
[37:20] So sometimes we have to lend a hand.
[37:24] Praise the name of our Lord. In many
[37:27] times in missions,
[37:33] you get to places
[37:36] but even the people want the gospel
[37:39] but their physical life is so bad.
[37:44] So you spend
[37:46] on your costs
[37:52] then even to their costs.
[37:55] It becomes a big burden
[37:58] and these are areas where we need to
[38:00] come up.
[38:02] Let us lend a helping hand to others who
[38:05] are not privileged where we are
[38:06] privileged.
[38:10] Some people don't have even water.
[38:13] Some people don't have different things.
[38:16] Then you get a call from maybe a pastor,
[38:20] one of those pastors.
[38:23] I'm in hospital,
[38:25] but I even don't have money to test the
[38:27] blood
[38:30] 5,000.
[38:32] Somebody's calling from afar.
[38:34] If only 5,000.
[38:37] Now if they cannot ask that,
[38:40] how are they eating then?
[38:43] So let us be concerned about others
[38:47] &gt;&gt; to know that there are other people who
[38:49] are of the body of Jesus Christ
[38:53] but they not as privileged as we are.
[38:58] So we need to see that we reach out to
[39:00] them
[39:02] give them support.
[39:04] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[39:06] some don't have even what to put on.
[39:10] He says, "My shoes are torn up."
[39:13] But he's preaching.
[39:15] The shirt is putting on,
[39:18] you know, the the collar is totally torn
[39:23] and he's putting a tie and he's happy,
[39:26] but you get him in the same shirt over
[39:28] the time.
[39:30] But the zillas for the Lord is
[39:34] then for us, we have too many.
[39:38] Let us learn to share what we have.
[39:41] That's part of the gospel.
[39:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Not saying
[39:46] God keep yourself warm,
[39:51] but you are not giving me what to cover
[39:53] myself.
[39:56] Not saying God bless you,
[39:58] but I'm going to sleep hungry.
[40:01] But then for you have a lot. The Bible
[40:04] says true religion,
[40:07] you know, is to go out and do that.
[40:11] Let us learn to be doing those kind of
[40:13] things.
[40:15] Praise the name of God. Let us invite
[40:17] the to come and sing.
[40:21] You're welcome.
[40:23] Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:27] Now, she has been at school
[40:30] and we thank God that she's back.
[40:33] Amen. Amen.
[41:15] God bless you.
[41:28] Jesus blood and righteousness.

[44:51] &gt;&gt; soul broke.
[44:53] [Music]
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Christ broke guys down.
[45:17] Amen. Before they go, let us clap for
[45:19] them.
[45:20] Before they go, just come back. Praise
[45:24] the name of our Lord. These are good
[45:27] songs to hear more and more. Praise the
[45:28] name.
[45:33] I told brother Martin
[45:36] to get me all our original songs.
[45:40] Then I put them on a flash.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; So from the time he gave me the flash, I
[45:44] think it was on last Sunday, last
[45:47] Saturday the other week.
[45:50] So they keep on playing in the car. So I
[45:53] was hearing this
[45:56] &gt;&gt; then I heard you know Christ stand. and
[46:01] then let them down.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Let them down.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So let us stand up and sing let them
[46:05] down

[46:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Allah.

[51:58] Praise the name of our Lord. We thank
[52:00] God for such,
[52:03] you know, spiritfilled singing.
[52:06] Praise the name of our Lord. He just
[52:08] revives you over and over again.
[52:12] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us pray
[52:14] before we go to the reading of the word.
[52:17] Father, we want to rejoice before you
[52:20] Lord
[52:21] for the great things that you do in our
[52:23] ministry.
[52:25] And now we appreciate you, Father
[52:28] that in every challenge,
[52:30] you have always put a way out of it. And
[52:33] we thank thee, Father. Now we pray that
[52:36] you may bless our hearts.
[52:38] Speak to us, Father. May the Holy Spirit
[52:41] search our hearts.
[52:43] Help us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[52:46] Receive that you've ordained for us
[52:47] today
[52:50] father and filling us with your spirit
[52:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[52:56] Amen. Amen. Let us go to our scriptures.
[53:03] We're reading in first kings chapter 11
[53:09] and then verse 38 only.
[53:14] First Kings 11 verse 38.
[53:25] The Bible says,
[53:28] &gt;&gt; "And it shall be if thou will hearken
[53:30] unto all that I command thee, and will
[53:34] walk in my ways, and do that is right in
[53:38] my sight, to keep my statutes and my
[53:41] commandments, as David my servant did,
[53:45] that I will be with you and build you a
[53:48] sure house, as I built for David and
[53:52] will give Israel unto you.
[54:26] Amen.
[54:29] You may be seated.
[54:31] Praise the name of our Lord.
[54:34] So I want to preach on the subject
[54:37] building a sure house
[54:41] building a sure house.
[54:45] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[54:47] know like in the normal house
[54:50] construction
[54:54] you know you take step by step
[54:58] and then you use different materials.
[55:03] Praise the name of our Lord and then you
[55:05] use different skills
[55:08] and then it takes time.
[55:11] Praise the name of our Lord. There are
[55:13] different skills.
[55:17] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[55:19] know like
[55:22] you know in construction
[55:25] like if we go to the the way the world
[55:28] has set it
[55:31] you know the the mind the the owner
[55:36] has the mind of what they want.
[55:41] So then he goes to an architect
[55:46] And then he tells him his mind.
[55:50] I want a house of this number of
[55:51] bedrooms.
[55:53] I want it to be like this. I want it to
[55:55] be like this. So he gets your mind
[56:00] and then he tries to make a draft
[56:04] and then he tries to give you. Do you
[56:07] want it like this? And nowadays
[56:10] technology has made things easy.
[56:13] There is you know different software as
[56:15] to draw for you the building plan.
[56:19] So you just put this that and then it
[56:22] can come with a beautiful picture.
[56:26] Those days it was all on drawing board.
[56:31] You just sit on the drawing board. You
[56:33] said this. You do this.
[56:36] But now things have been made easy
[56:39] until they can put there for you the
[56:41] trees.
[56:43] They put for you there the bed. They put
[56:45] for you there, you know, the paving, the
[56:47] car, and then you see a real picture.
[56:52] Sometimes they can even make a video
[56:55] and then you say, "Hey, this is how the
[56:56] house is going to be like. This is where
[56:58] I'm going to sit. They can do all that."
[57:02] But you see, to come up with that,
[57:07] it takes a lot of effort.
[57:12] It takes time.
[57:14] It takes materials.
[57:17] And it takes Okay. It takes the right
[57:19] material.
[57:22] It takes the right skills,
[57:25] the right people and sometimes even the
[57:29] right equipment
[57:33] like in there is a place I I saw in Toro
[57:37] when I was still working there and this
[57:40] man built his hospital
[57:44] is highly educated person
[57:49] but then he got standard materials
[57:54] because he was using metals to do the
[57:57] roofing,
[58:00] not even timber
[58:02] and then you would look at the building.
[58:06] So you find out when you are outside
[58:10] and you look at the roof
[58:13] which is called the eve.
[58:19] It starts here with about 4 ft.
[58:24] But when you go to the end there,
[58:27] it's only 2 ft.
[58:30] Then you start wondering what happened.
[58:33] Good materials,
[58:35] quality materials,
[58:37] but poor skilled people.
[58:41] Then you go and then look at the ceiling
[58:45] spent good money, but all of it is
[58:48] cracked up.
[58:50] Then you go and look at the floor.
[58:59] But now when you look at that,
[59:03] however much you grind it,
[59:06] it's always dirty.
[59:10] He had the right materials.
[59:13] He had the right plan.
[59:16] But he used the wrong people.
[59:20] to do the work. So you wouldn't get a
[59:23] good job done.
[59:26] So in construction,
[59:29] you must have the right plan.
[59:32] You must have the right materials.
[59:34] You must have the right people to do the
[59:36] job
[59:38] and the right equipment.
[59:41] And then you must give it time.
[59:45] Now a house we should look at it
[59:49] as you as an individual
[59:52] as a house.
[59:54] Praise the name of our Lord. God took
[59:57] takes time to build you.
[1:00:01] Praise the name of the Lord. And then a
[1:00:03] house we should look at it as your
[1:00:07] family.
[1:00:10] Then a house we should look at it as a
[1:00:13] church. Our
[1:00:16] church then a house we should look at it
[1:00:20] has the kingdom of God.
[1:00:23] So we are talking about building a sure
[1:00:25] house.
[1:00:28] How do you build a sure house?
[1:00:31] You as an individual as the house.
[1:00:34] Then your family as the house.
[1:00:37] Then the church as the house. Then the
[1:00:40] kingdom of God as a house.
[1:00:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we see
[1:00:45] God was telling Jeroboam
[1:00:48] and he told him in the scripture that we
[1:00:51] have read and said, "If you will hearken
[1:00:54] to all that I command you
[1:00:59] and will walk in my ways,
[1:01:03] not your own ways."
[1:01:06] Because you can have your own ways, but
[1:01:09] those are not the ways of God.
[1:01:13] You can get the ways of the world.
[1:01:16] You can get the ways of your your your
[1:01:18] profession
[1:01:21] like sometimes the ways of our
[1:01:22] profession.
[1:01:25] You know the things we've been taught in
[1:01:26] school
[1:01:28] are contrary to the way the Lord does
[1:01:30] things.
[1:01:32] For example, somebody who has done
[1:01:34] economics,
[1:01:40] you know, oh maybe
[1:01:45] they are taught
[1:01:47] the more you holding
[1:01:51] the money
[1:01:53] is better for you.
[1:01:57] Then God tells you
[1:02:01] to give
[1:02:03] is more blessed than
[1:02:06] the other one. They are teaching you
[1:02:09] don't give.
[1:02:11] God is telling you give.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Even they teach you
[1:02:21] if somebody has a debt with you,
[1:02:26] you try to hold some back.
[1:02:31] Then God tells you if you have
[1:02:33] somebody's debt,
[1:02:36] pay him. He comes today, don't sleep
[1:02:39] with his money.
[1:02:42] Then they tell you no, what you need to
[1:02:45] do, keep this money and put it in the
[1:02:47] bank and make more interest
[1:02:51] and you give them. God says no
[1:02:54] the ways of man than the ways of God.
[1:02:58] Then he was telling Jeroboam,
[1:03:01] if you'll walk in my ways.
[1:03:05] And then he says, and do that is right
[1:03:08] in my sight.
[1:03:12] to keep my statutes
[1:03:15] and my commandments
[1:03:17] as David my servant did
[1:03:23] that I will be with you.
[1:03:27] See the condition God is giving
[1:03:30] it's not difficult.
[1:03:32] He's telling you just follow my
[1:03:35] instruction.
[1:03:38] Just follow my guidelines.
[1:03:41] follow my plan.
[1:03:43] Praise the name of the Lord. Just follow
[1:03:46] it.
[1:03:48] And then he said, I will be with you.
[1:03:52] Now he's telling you, I have come to
[1:03:57] build you a house.
[1:04:01] But how will he build you a house?
[1:04:04] He's calling for your cooperation.
[1:04:08] Let us be co-workers,
[1:04:10] but let me be your guide.
[1:04:13] Not you to take whatever you want and
[1:04:16] then you remember me when you want, but
[1:04:19] from every step of the way that you can
[1:04:22] depend upon the leadership of God.
[1:04:27] Then he said, "I will build you a sure
[1:04:30] house
[1:04:33] as I built for David
[1:04:36] and will give you Israel."
[1:04:39] Because it's God who called Jeroboam
[1:04:42] and said, "I'm giving you the 10 tribes
[1:04:46] and is the one who made the people favor
[1:04:49] Jeroboam
[1:04:52] until they when Jerobam was even not in
[1:04:54] the country.
[1:04:57] Then they called to him please come and
[1:05:00] they said you be our leader.
[1:05:03] Then
[1:05:06] rehobam
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; when he heard that the 10 tribes were
[1:05:11] rejecting him from being their king.
[1:05:15] He got the armies
[1:05:18] to go and fight Israel.
[1:05:20] Then God told him, "Don't go. Those are
[1:05:24] your brothers." So you see already God
[1:05:27] was protecting the kingdom of Jeroboam
[1:05:33] because it was the will of God that let
[1:05:37] Jeroboam rule distrib.
[1:05:41] But now Jeroboam
[1:05:43] after he had become the king
[1:05:46] his heart turned away from God.
[1:05:52] He started devising his own things.
[1:05:56] He started taking his own path.
[1:06:00] He started doing his own ways.
[1:06:03] And he forgot everything about God.
[1:06:08] But Jeroboam,
[1:06:10] he had an example to look to.
[1:06:13] And that was King David.
[1:06:16] And God told him, "If you'll do
[1:06:18] everything the way David did,
[1:06:22] said I'm going to build you a
[1:06:25] praise the name of our Lord." And God
[1:06:28] has not left us without a witness.
[1:06:32] You have somebody to look to
[1:06:35] who has gone through what you're going
[1:06:36] through and have been able to overcome.
[1:06:40] Praise the name of the Lord. There's
[1:06:42] somebody who is ahead of you.
[1:06:44] Somebody God has put before you
[1:06:47] in your life to overcome to be a sure
[1:06:51] house of God
[1:06:53] in your life. There's somebody God has
[1:06:57] put ahead of you. God has given grace,
[1:07:01] who has overcome what you are overcome,
[1:07:05] who has overcome what you're going
[1:07:06] through.
[1:07:08] So there is already a sure house before
[1:07:10] you.
[1:07:12] God also wants you to be a sure house
[1:07:16] in your family. There's an example God
[1:07:19] has put before you.
[1:07:22] How you can have your family also be a
[1:07:24] sure house.
[1:07:26] How we can make our church be a sure
[1:07:28] house.
[1:07:30] How we can have the kingdom of God
[1:07:33] established
[1:07:34] into a sure house.
[1:07:38] Praise the name of our Lord. God was
[1:07:39] telling Jeroboam,
[1:07:42] "David, my servant
[1:07:45] did this thing and I built him a shower
[1:07:48] house."
[1:07:51] Praise the name of our Lord. We all need
[1:07:53] to be to be building shower houses
[1:07:57] as your anid
[1:08:00] be a house. Your family, let it be a
[1:08:03] showhouse.
[1:08:05] Our church, let it be a showhouse.
[1:08:09] How will the things happen?
[1:08:12] And you know construction is step by
[1:08:14] step.
[1:08:17] Praise the name of our Lord. It's a step
[1:08:19] by step.
[1:08:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:08:24] Matthew chapter 7
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; and then verse 24
[1:08:31] the Bible says
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; therefore soever heareth these sayings
[1:08:35] of mine and does them I will liken him
[1:08:40] unto a wise man which built his house
[1:08:43] upon a rock.
[1:08:50] [Music]
[1:08:59] Praise the name of the Lord. He says,
[1:09:01] "Whoever heareth my sayings,
[1:09:05] whoever heareth my word
[1:09:08] and obeys them,"
[1:09:11] then he says, "He is a wise man."
[1:09:16] What does the wise man do?
[1:09:19] He said he built his house
[1:09:22] on a rock. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:09:25] You know when people are building,
[1:09:29] praise the name of the Lord. That having
[1:09:31] been my work for a number of years,
[1:09:35] you go to a place where they building.
[1:09:38] Somebody digs a foundation of one ft
[1:09:46] just from here up to here.
[1:09:51] down is soil.
[1:09:55] And then when they build
[1:09:58] the thing which comes above the soil,
[1:10:02] that's what they call the foundation.
[1:10:04] And you find it's about four, five ft
[1:10:06] up.
[1:10:10] But what is down is short.
[1:10:14] Now when it starts raining
[1:10:17] you will see the foundation is up this
[1:10:19] way
[1:10:21] and then you say hey what's happened
[1:10:23] this house
[1:10:25] and the house starts cracking and falls
[1:10:29] that's what they do most of the places
[1:10:32] but yet you're meant to build at least
[1:10:34] dig two and a half feet
[1:10:40] the only one because it's saving
[1:10:42] material
[1:10:45] and found you can't repair it many
[1:10:47] times.
[1:10:52] So if it damages
[1:10:54] all the upper thing cracks,
[1:10:57] crumbles.
[1:10:59] So they want to put most money up
[1:11:03] but then down there's nothing good. Like
[1:11:06] some of those buildings you see when you
[1:11:09] see the wall is too small
[1:11:12] or the columns are too small.
[1:11:16] Now when they come to finish then they
[1:11:19] put a thick layer of motor
[1:11:23] but that's not the thing that holds the
[1:11:25] house.
[1:11:27] It is this small thing which he has
[1:11:31] cheated
[1:11:35] and then he puts this outer thing then
[1:11:37] you'll say I've bought a house
[1:11:40] then after some time the house is
[1:11:41] collapsing
[1:11:44] because the builders didn't do the right
[1:11:46] job
[1:11:47] and then sometimes they build the walls
[1:11:51] and they put little cement
[1:11:54] and then when it comes to plaster they
[1:11:56] try put material
[1:12:01] insect start getting inside there.
[1:12:10] Many things.
[1:12:12] So Jesus saying
[1:12:15] a wise man
[1:12:18] will build the house on his rock.
[1:12:22] So your foundation must be strong.
[1:12:27] Praise the name of the Lord. What
[1:12:29] foundation are you building for your
[1:12:31] family?
[1:12:34] What foundation are you building for
[1:12:36] your family?
[1:12:39] What foundation are we building for the
[1:12:41] church?
[1:12:44] What foundation?
[1:12:46] And all this comes from the decisions
[1:12:49] that you make.
[1:12:52] He says, "He that heareth my words
[1:12:57] and does them."
[1:12:59] Now, if you hear the word and you don't
[1:13:02] do this, your decisions are wrong.
[1:13:07] So, if your decisions are wrong,
[1:13:10] you are building a house that will not
[1:13:12] last.
[1:13:15] You are getting your life into disaster.
[1:13:19] You are getting your family into this
[1:13:21] area.
[1:13:24] What foundation are you building?
[1:13:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you
[1:13:30] want to marry, what is the choice of the
[1:13:33] person you're choosing to marry?
[1:13:36] Are you looking at something here?
[1:13:39] The way the the world looks at things,
[1:13:43] it's a wrong foundation.
[1:13:45] Ah, she looks better than the others.
[1:13:50] That's a flower.
[1:13:53] Not the flower does what?
[1:13:56] Wilts.
[1:13:59] So when it it wields,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; what are you going to do?
[1:14:04] So you say maybe I exchange and get
[1:14:06] another one.
[1:14:11] Building a foundation.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "And the rain descended."
[1:14:17] Verse 25.
[1:14:20] And the floods came
[1:14:23] and the winds blew
[1:14:25] and beat upon that house
[1:14:28] and it fell not
[1:14:31] for it was founded upon a rock.
[1:14:36] Now you see this scripture here. You are
[1:14:39] building a house but not that there are
[1:14:42] circumstances that come
[1:14:46] adverse weather effects.
[1:14:50] You know things which are tough,
[1:14:54] storms come,
[1:14:56] floods come,
[1:14:58] vibrations come. Like when they're
[1:15:01] building some of these roads
[1:15:03] and then the road is passing vibrating
[1:15:09] and it it now vibrates
[1:15:12] and now your house you feel like as if
[1:15:13] it's going to break down
[1:15:16] wrong foundation.
[1:15:19] If now that roll alone can make that
[1:15:25] what foundation
[1:15:27] how are you building your house? How are
[1:15:30] you making the decisions that affect
[1:15:31] your life?
[1:15:34] How are you setting up your family?
[1:15:38] Praise the name of the Lord. How are you
[1:15:40] handling the things of your life?
[1:15:43] Oh, it's just like Ahab
[1:15:46] because the Bible says
[1:15:49] it was a small thing.
[1:15:52] It seemed a light thing.
[1:15:54] He does this. But that one is okay. He
[1:15:58] does the other. is okay.
[1:16:01] How are you building your house?
[1:16:04] Because the rains will come, the floods
[1:16:07] will come, the winds will come and they
[1:16:11] will come against that house.
[1:16:16] Now those frustrations in this life,
[1:16:19] circumstances come in your life,
[1:16:22] temptations will come, trials will come,
[1:16:26] conditions change.
[1:16:29] Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes
[1:16:32] something happens which you never
[1:16:34] expected.
[1:16:37] So how do you handle those adverse
[1:16:39] conditions that
[1:16:42] it's all about how you've built your
[1:16:44] heart.
[1:16:47] how your life is standing,
[1:16:49] how your family is standing.
[1:16:52] Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you
[1:16:54] marry,
[1:16:56] your wife is married
[1:16:59] or your husband gets an accident
[1:17:03] or your husband loses the job,
[1:17:10] then it was not built right.
[1:17:14] There are things you are looking at
[1:17:17] and not the right thing.
[1:17:20] Not the oneness in marriage.
[1:17:24] Not the unity
[1:17:26] in loving one another.
[1:17:28] Until you until you vote until death.
[1:17:33] Now that one is just in the mouth
[1:17:36] but in the heart
[1:17:43] and they fire from that job
[1:17:47] and is no longer
[1:17:51] for me I want to be called Mrs.
[1:17:54] Honorable
[1:17:56] losing a parliamentary seat
[1:17:58] parliament you're losing anything
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; and he loses everything.
[1:18:04] I can't be laughed at.
[1:18:08] The car's got problems.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; We start footing. Ah, baby.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; I look for another one.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; There was a saying which they were
[1:18:18] asking.
[1:18:20] They were asking people,
[1:18:22] would you rather laugh on or cry in a b
[1:18:32] I would rather at least be in a I'm
[1:18:35] crying
[1:18:39] people's choices
[1:18:41] doesn't know that even on you can afford
[1:18:43] the Bord
[1:18:51] and then you die soon
[1:18:56] praise the name of but people's decision
[1:18:59] are different.
[1:19:01] So we need to see that we build a sure
[1:19:04] house.
[1:19:06] Then in verse 26, he says, "And everyone
[1:19:09] that hears these sayings of mine
[1:19:14] and does them not
[1:19:17] shall be likened unto a foolish man,
[1:19:22] which built his house upon the sand,
[1:19:27] and the rain descended,
[1:19:30] and the floods came, and the winds blew,
[1:19:34] and bit up. They beat upon the house
[1:19:38] and it fell and great was the fall of
[1:19:41] it.
[1:19:44] Praise the name of God. Now the Bible
[1:19:46] says we are built upon the foundation
[1:19:51] of the prophets and the apostles
[1:19:55] Jesus Christ being the chief
[1:19:57] cornerstone.
[1:19:58] That's the foundation to build up.
[1:20:02] And so you need that you build
[1:20:04] everything.
[1:20:06] If we are building any house,
[1:20:09] build it on the rock foundation.
[1:20:13] Build it. Build it on the word of God.
[1:20:17] Your life, let it be built on the word
[1:20:19] of God.
[1:20:21] Your family, let it be built on the word
[1:20:24] of God.
[1:20:25] And then the church, we are building it
[1:20:28] on the word of God.
[1:20:31] The kingdom of God is built by the word
[1:20:33] of God. And that's what God was telling
[1:20:36] Jeroboam.
[1:20:39] If you will hear these things and then
[1:20:42] do these things, then I will build you a
[1:20:45] sure house.
[1:20:48] Praise the name of our Lord. And he was
[1:20:50] meaning the kingdom of Israel.
[1:20:53] You'll be established
[1:20:56] and you'll see the kingdom prospering.
[1:21:00] And it's the same thing even to us.
[1:21:03] How will the Lord bless us?
[1:21:05] Let us do what the Lord wants us to do.
[1:21:08] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[1:21:10] God wants us to do.
[1:21:13] Do what is right.
[1:21:15] Obey his word. Just like David.
[1:21:19] Because the Bible says
[1:21:22] in 1 Samuel chapter 13
[1:21:26] and then verse 13.
[1:21:33] And Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done
[1:21:36] foolishly, thou hast not kept the
[1:21:39] commandment of the Lord thy God, which
[1:21:42] he commanded thee. For now would the
[1:21:45] Lord have established thy kingdom upon
[1:21:49] Israel forever.
[1:22:09] So the prophet was telling the king,
[1:22:13] why have you not obeyed the commandment
[1:22:15] of God
[1:22:17] said you've done foolishly?
[1:22:21] You are destroying your house.
[1:22:24] You are troubling your house.
[1:22:27] And many of us trouble our houses.
[1:22:31] We trouble our lives by going into
[1:22:34] things contrary to the word of God.
[1:22:37] And then you get yourself into more
[1:22:39] trouble.
[1:22:40] You find you in this trouble from this
[1:22:43] another trouble. It keeps on coming
[1:22:47] or even your family. You trouble your
[1:22:50] house.
[1:22:51] Today you are saying this. The other day
[1:22:54] you are saying that nobody can even
[1:22:57] understand it.
[1:22:59] How do you live in a house?
[1:23:02] Husband does not understand wife. The
[1:23:04] wife does not understand the husband.
[1:23:06] The children don't understand the father
[1:23:09] or the mother. Even the parents don't
[1:23:11] understand the children.
[1:23:14] Just in the same house by circumstance.
[1:23:18] Everybody is looking at how we can be
[1:23:20] liberated from that house.
[1:23:25] Houses are not meant to be bondages.
[1:23:28] They are meant to be places of freedom.
[1:23:32] But then how will you have freedom in
[1:23:34] your house
[1:23:36] in your household
[1:23:38] in your family if you've put God aside?
[1:23:42] Now the Bible says in the book of
[1:23:45] Proverbs
[1:23:48] verse 11 29
[1:23:53] verse 29 he says he that traveth his own
[1:23:58] house shall inherit wind
[1:24:05] that's what the Bible is saying travel
[1:24:07] your house
[1:24:09] today you are putting new laws
[1:24:12] or you are breaking them
[1:24:14] together. You know, you just like a a
[1:24:17] shifting kind of island.
[1:24:22] This wind comes from the north,
[1:24:25] drives it to the south.
[1:24:29] Then he says,
[1:24:31] "This is where we belong." Now another
[1:24:33] wind comes from there
[1:24:36] drives it to the east
[1:24:40] shifting sun.
[1:24:43] That's a house that's built not on the
[1:24:46] word of God.
[1:24:48] Even our lives
[1:24:50] we should be reliable
[1:24:53] at your place of work. Be reliable at
[1:24:57] your home. Be reliable in your
[1:25:00] community. reliable.
[1:25:03] Now there are some people who know how
[1:25:04] to change phones every other day.
[1:25:09] Yes. Today is calling you on this
[1:25:11] number. Hey who I am so and so. Hey what
[1:25:15] happened
[1:25:17] after one month is another life.
[1:25:20] What happens
[1:25:23] do this way?
[1:25:28] You know just like parents who like
[1:25:31] changing children from one school to the
[1:25:33] other
[1:25:36] goes and gets habits of this school.
[1:25:39] term one
[1:25:40] term two is in another school
[1:25:43] then again another school until the
[1:25:46] child gives up on study
[1:25:51] this holiday with this relative
[1:26:04] when do you raise your children.
[1:26:11] This way here, the other way were there,
[1:26:14] the other way were there. Until the
[1:26:15] children become confused,
[1:26:20] traveling your house,
[1:26:23] not reliable.
[1:26:26] So you find that somebody grows up in
[1:26:28] that kind of situation,
[1:26:33] troubled life, so much exposed to many
[1:26:36] funny things
[1:26:39] until even their thoughts are corrupted.
[1:26:45] And the Bible says if you travel your
[1:26:48] house, you shall inherit wind.
[1:26:53] I don't know what how you you you
[1:26:54] inherit wind.
[1:26:57] You can't even keep it in a room.
[1:27:01] Even the wind which is put in a balloon
[1:27:03] can bust.
[1:27:08] So you end up losing everything
[1:27:12] because you are traveling your house.
[1:27:15] So that was what Saul was doing.
[1:27:20] He traveled his house when he was not
[1:27:23] obedient to the word of God.
[1:27:26] He traveled his house. These men go to
[1:27:29] fight.
[1:27:32] They are hungry
[1:27:34] for three days. They have not eaten
[1:27:36] anything.
[1:27:38] Then they find honey.
[1:27:41] They are hungry. They in the battle. He
[1:27:44] says nobody should eat anything.
[1:27:47] Then the son said,
[1:27:49] why does my father travel the house?
[1:27:55] So there are some of those decisions
[1:27:57] make which are not right.
[1:28:00] Why would you travel your house? How do
[1:28:03] you travel your house? By not following
[1:28:06] the word of God.
[1:28:09] As a wife do be as a wife as the Bible
[1:28:12] says.
[1:28:15] Praise the name of as a husband. Be as a
[1:28:18] husband as the Bible says.
[1:28:21] But now you shift goalpost.
[1:28:25] You are traveling your house.
[1:28:28] So at the end of the day, you inherit
[1:28:30] wind.
[1:28:33] Praise the name of God. You inherit
[1:28:35] wind.
[1:28:37] When the children of Israel, we are
[1:28:40] taking over the cities.
[1:28:43] God told them, "Don't take anything
[1:28:48] from those places you are conquering."
[1:28:51] And then there was a
[1:28:54] and he saw the Babylonian garment
[1:28:58] said ah
[1:29:00] this is a blessing
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; I can't leave this he took it and many
[1:29:05] of the children of Israel perished in
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:09] now in Joshua 6:1 17
[1:29:16] the Bible says and the city shall be a
[1:29:19] cast given it and all that are there in
[1:29:24] to the Lord. Joshua chapter chapter 6
[1:29:26] rather verse 17
[1:29:40] 6 verse 17 the topic
[1:29:56] and the city shall be a cast even it and
[1:29:59] all that are therein to the Lord only
[1:30:02] Rahab the hallot shall live she and all
[1:30:05] that are with her in the house because
[1:30:08] she hid the messengers that went
[1:30:12] and ye and in any wise keep yourselves
[1:30:14] from the acast thing, lest you make
[1:30:17] yourself a cast and when you take of the
[1:30:20] acast thing and make the camp of Israel
[1:30:23] a curse and travel itch.
[1:30:40] I want to
[1:30:52] be
[1:31:27] Now he said if you take the accost thing
[1:31:31] you'll make the whole camp of Israel a
[1:31:34] cast.
[1:31:39] And so when you get away from the ways
[1:31:42] of God,
[1:31:45] when you get away from the word of God
[1:31:49] and then you do something contrary,
[1:31:52] then it is all not good.
[1:31:57] Praise the name of our Lord. It is
[1:31:59] something that is cast,
[1:32:02] something which is out of the way.
[1:32:05] So now if you find yourself you are out
[1:32:08] of the way,
[1:32:10] the way of the Lord, you need to get
[1:32:13] back to the way of the Lord.
[1:32:15] You need to get back to what the Lord is
[1:32:17] saying.
[1:32:20] That's how you build a sure house.
[1:32:23] That's how you can have a blessing of
[1:32:25] the Lord.
[1:32:27] But now when Akan saw the things
[1:32:31] in Joshua chapter 7
[1:32:34] and then verse 20,
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; the scripture says,
[1:32:42] "And Akan answered Joshua and said,
[1:32:44] "Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord
[1:32:47] God of Israel, and thus and thus have I
[1:32:49] done. When I saw the spoils of a goodly
[1:32:53] babylonish garment and 200 shekels of
[1:32:57] silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels
[1:33:00] weight, then I coverted them and took
[1:33:03] them and behold they are hid in the
[1:33:06] earth in the midst of my tent and the
[1:33:08] silver under it.
[1:33:24] When
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:44] Ichech
[1:33:56] Now
[1:33:59] brought death to Israel
[1:34:02] when he took the things that were cast.
[1:34:08] Now there are some of these things of
[1:34:11] the world
[1:34:13] which are so attractive,
[1:34:16] so enticing,
[1:34:19] say, I wish I would have that.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I wish I would get this kind of thing.
[1:34:24] And then you find yourself, you are
[1:34:26] converting after these things,
[1:34:29] but yet they are bringing destruction in
[1:34:32] your life.
[1:34:34] They are bringing destruction in your
[1:34:36] house.
[1:34:38] So we need to see that we avoid
[1:34:40] everything that's of the world
[1:34:44] that is contrary to what the way of the
[1:34:46] Lord is.
[1:34:49] Praise the name of our Lord. see that
[1:34:51] you avoid things that are contrary to
[1:34:53] the word of God
[1:34:56] to be like a
[1:34:59] brought death
[1:35:01] to his family himself, his wife and the
[1:35:06] children were all destroyed
[1:35:10] because of the thing he lasted after.
[1:35:13] So we need to see that we build a sure
[1:35:15] house.
[1:35:18] We need to see that you know we have the
[1:35:20] kingdom of God
[1:35:22] established in our lives.
[1:35:25] Let the kingdom of God be established in
[1:35:28] your family. See that you do everything
[1:35:32] according to the way the Lord has taught
[1:35:35] us to do.
[1:35:37] Let us build a sure house.
[1:35:40] Let us follow the word of the Lord.
[1:35:44] Don't turn left.
[1:35:46] and right. That's what God was telling
[1:35:48] Joshua.
[1:35:50] Follow the law of Moses.
[1:35:53] Read it. Meditate upon it day and night.
[1:35:58] Praise the name of our God. And then how
[1:36:00] will you learn to do the right thing?
[1:36:04] If you don't give yourself over to
[1:36:06] reading the word of God,
[1:36:08] you don't take time to hear the word of
[1:36:10] God.
[1:36:12] Now the Bible says, "Praise the name of
[1:36:15] our Lord." Let us go to the book of
[1:36:16] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians.
[1:36:28] Chapter 13.
[1:36:34] Okay. Sorry. Chapter 14 and then verse
[1:36:36] 30.
[1:36:40] It says, Let your women keep silence in
[1:36:43] the churches, for it's not permitted
[1:36:45] unto them to speak, but they are
[1:36:47] commanded to be under obedience, as also
[1:36:50] says the Lord.
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:37:01] Verse
[1:37:05] 35.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And if they will learn anything, let
[1:37:10] them ask their husbands at home. For it
[1:37:13] is a shame for women to speak in the
[1:37:16] church.
[1:37:27] Now you see this responsibility here.
[1:37:30] husband.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know the word of God?
[1:37:36] But then you find a husband is all the
[1:37:39] time re doing his work.
[1:37:44] Even time of prayer is dozing
[1:37:48] because he's tired.
[1:37:51] He's tired.
[1:37:53] But now the Bible says if the wife is to
[1:37:56] ask,
[1:37:57] let them ask their husband at home.
[1:38:00] But then your husband doesn't know the
[1:38:02] word.
[1:38:06] Troubled house.
[1:38:09] He doesn't know his position
[1:38:13] doesn't have time
[1:38:15] to read the word.
[1:38:18] He will raise his family as maybe by
[1:38:21] chance and by luck.
[1:38:30] just by chance.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Today he's saying this, tomorrow is
[1:38:33] saying another you can't find him
[1:38:35] anywhere.
[1:38:37] And then people don't know the word of
[1:38:39] God
[1:38:43] because the head is Christ.
[1:38:46] The head of the man is Christ
[1:38:50] and Christ is the word. But this man
[1:38:53] doesn't have the word.
[1:38:55] He doesn't have the head.
[1:38:59] So anything is going to use it.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Women of these days if she familiars
[1:39:09] you, you bless her.
[1:39:12] There is no head there. Now
[1:39:17] fear,
[1:39:19] terror.
[1:39:22] If he's going to ask anything
[1:39:25] immediately just says why do you ask me?
[1:39:29] So that shirts the question the next
[1:39:31] time
[1:39:33] headless
[1:39:35] because the head is Christ the head is
[1:39:37] the word but it's not there
[1:39:41] but then maybe sometimes you got into
[1:39:43] this marriage
[1:39:46] maybe because you saw he's good
[1:39:49] maybe he's having this good job
[1:39:53] he has a good house he has a good car
[1:39:57] and that one I can't leave.
[1:39:59] Now when you get inside
[1:40:02] then you find that there is no head.
[1:40:06] [Laughter]
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; No head.
[1:40:11] But you are but you vote to live with
[1:40:13] that headless life.
[1:40:20] What a horrible situation you'll be in.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; So you need to be careful.
[1:40:27] Be careful
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; what decisions you make.
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Does he have the head?
[1:40:46] Why is it
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; so you get into troubles
[1:40:52] when he doesn't care
[1:40:54] is doing his own thing
[1:40:57] like
[1:40:59] he didn't care
[1:41:01] and then you are in that trouble
[1:41:05] first year second year 10 years
[1:41:10] how long are you going to be on earth
[1:41:11] with that
[1:41:14] make the right decision.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Or even
[1:41:19] brothers,
[1:41:22] he may just say, "Ah, this one looks
[1:41:24] good."
[1:41:27] Like Samson says, "I like that one."
[1:41:32] Say, "But we have better in Israel."
[1:41:36] For him was attracted by the appearance
[1:41:42] and he ended up losing his glory.
[1:41:46] Because the other one was a money maker.
[1:41:50] Not interested in your relationship or
[1:41:52] fellowship.
[1:42:02] what they go with.
[1:42:05] If you lose your job, marriage is over.
[1:42:10] He looks for the highest bidder.
[1:42:15] Now, let me just read this thing here.
[1:42:16] Yeah.
[1:42:18] Choosing of the bride. He says again the
[1:42:22] kind of woman that a man would choose
[1:42:27] will reflect his ambition
[1:42:31] and his character. If a man chooses the
[1:42:35] wrong woman,
[1:42:37] it reflects his character
[1:42:40] and what he ties himself to
[1:42:45] shows truly what is in him.
[1:42:49] A woman reflects what's in the man.
[1:42:53] When he chooses her for a wife,
[1:42:56] it shows what's down in him.
[1:43:00] No matter what he says outside,
[1:43:04] watch what he marries.
[1:43:12] Yeah. You see, I think this one was
[1:43:15] interested in this.
[1:43:18] And because that's the thing that
[1:43:19] attracted the person,
[1:43:22] then he says, "I go to a man's office
[1:43:26] and he says he's a Christian
[1:43:28] pins up all around the walls.
[1:43:33] Those old boowig music going on.
[1:43:38] I don't care what he says.
[1:43:41] I don't believe his testimony
[1:43:44] because his spirit
[1:43:46] is feeding on them things of the world.
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:51] Now you don't need to put them on the
[1:43:53] wall now.
[1:43:55] But what do you spend most of your time
[1:43:56] on phone?
[1:44:00] Because you are feeding. It's a spirit
[1:44:04] all the time. You're in rumor mongering
[1:44:11] politics.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, this sports betting
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; those are spirits.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Feeding on this, feeding on this,
[1:44:23] feeding on this. Then he says
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; what say if he marries a chorus girl or
[1:44:33] what would call a sex queen
[1:44:44] or just a pretty modern ricketer.
[1:44:53] It reflects
[1:44:55] It shows what he has in his mind
[1:45:00] of what his future home is going to be
[1:45:05] because he's took the her to raise his
[1:45:07] children by
[1:45:12] now. If herself she doesn't have morals,
[1:45:17] what kind of children are they going to
[1:45:18] be raised?
[1:45:20] like you see on the streets, the mothers
[1:45:23] putting on tight things
[1:45:26] and then the children doing the same.
[1:45:31] There's a school I was told
[1:45:33] that you know they told the girls to put
[1:45:36] on pettic coats
[1:45:39] petty
[1:45:41] they said we we don't have them even our
[1:45:44] mothers don't put them on
[1:45:48] that kind of condition we have today
[1:45:54] they just don't care
[1:45:56] if the mother doesn't do it how will the
[1:45:59] daughters be raised up
[1:46:02] How are the children going to be raised
[1:46:03] up?
[1:46:04] What house are you building?
[1:46:08] What character are you molding?
[1:46:11] Same thing with us parents. What example
[1:46:14] are we giving the children?
[1:46:19] What examples are you giving them? All
[1:46:21] the time maybe you are quarreling
[1:46:24] all the time. You are dodging.
[1:46:27] Every time the child does something,
[1:46:29] keep on promising.
[1:46:30] promising.
[1:46:34] It's just deceiving me.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; What kind of children are you raising
[1:46:39] up?
[1:46:41] How are you building your house
[1:46:45] until your children don't trust you
[1:46:47] anymore
[1:46:50] and that's where the trouble comes in.
[1:46:53] And then there are also some situations
[1:46:57] where the parents overrust their
[1:46:59] children
[1:47:03] until they don't do due diligence.
[1:47:14] The child tells you this, you take it
[1:47:17] 100%.
[1:47:19] You don't go and find out. The child is
[1:47:22] telling me this.
[1:47:23] But let me go and find out is what the
[1:47:27] child telling me true.
[1:47:30] The child tells you about against
[1:47:32] teachers at school.
[1:47:36] Those teachers are bad
[1:47:39] and then you end up losing your children
[1:47:41] because they know how to deceive you.
[1:47:44] So everything they know where to touch.
[1:47:49] By the time you discover
[1:47:51] it's too late,
[1:47:53] why don't you do due diligence as a
[1:47:56] parent?
[1:47:59] Go and find out
[1:48:01] what's happening
[1:48:04] and do it with calmness,
[1:48:07] not being rough.
[1:48:09] They have talked about your child.
[1:48:12] Go and determine what is happening.
[1:48:14] Really
[1:48:17] that's how we raise our children.
[1:48:20] Let us look at here.
[1:48:23] Let us go to the book of Esther.
[1:48:28] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:48:33] Let's go to the book of Esther chapter
[1:48:35] 2.
[1:48:46] And then we read in verse 10,
[1:48:51] Esther had not showed her people nor her
[1:48:54] kindred, for Modi had charged her that
[1:48:57] she should not show it.
[1:49:12] And Modi walked every day before the
[1:49:16] court of the women's house to know how
[1:49:18] Esther did and what should become of
[1:49:21] her.
[1:49:32] He took interest
[1:49:35] out how is Esther doing.
[1:49:39] He goes out there.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; He asks these people, "How is Esther?
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; How is she doing?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; How is she behaving? Talks to her."
[1:49:51] As parents, take interest in your
[1:49:54] children
[1:49:57] and some are too busy. They have taken
[1:50:00] their children to school and have no
[1:50:03] time to visit them.
[1:50:06] When it comes to visitation,
[1:50:08] no time to talk to the teachers.
[1:50:12] So all the time he's too busy even when
[1:50:15] they call him hey what do you want have
[1:50:18] you increase school fees
[1:50:20] fees?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; No listen first
[1:50:23] but just rough
[1:50:26] is not concerned about how the children
[1:50:29] are fairing.
[1:50:33] How are you building your house?
[1:50:37] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:50:39] know the Bible says let us speak this
[1:50:42] scripture about children.
[1:50:44] Ephesians chapter 6 verse4.
[1:50:48] The Bible says and you fathers provoke
[1:50:52] not your children to wrath but bring
[1:50:55] them up in the nature and admonition of
[1:50:58] the Lord.
[1:51:15] He said nature,
[1:51:19] you know, discipline,
[1:51:24] you know, find out what their condition
[1:51:26] is.
[1:51:28] Let your children not become strangers
[1:51:30] to you
[1:51:33] all the day you at work.
[1:51:36] You come back tired
[1:51:38] and then you find you have them the
[1:51:41] people help you keep your children at
[1:51:43] home
[1:51:44] but you are too rough to those people
[1:51:46] keep your children
[1:51:50] too rough. You don't want to hear what
[1:51:53] they telling you
[1:51:55] or even when they say something, you
[1:51:58] take it against them,
[1:52:00] but you don't take time. They told me
[1:52:04] this kid likes doing this and this. Take
[1:52:07] time. Find out
[1:52:10] find out the affairs of your children.
[1:52:14] You in order to discipline them,
[1:52:17] find the facts.
[1:52:20] But some people they are only watching
[1:52:24] for the mistakes of the people who keep
[1:52:26] their children
[1:52:30] only not the discipline of their
[1:52:33] children.
[1:52:35] This person who keeps your children is a
[1:52:36] hier.
[1:52:42] You remain with your children. How is
[1:52:44] the discipline of your children? How are
[1:52:47] you nurturing your children? How are you
[1:52:49] raising your children?
[1:52:52] How do you do that?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; You know at home when you are there no
[1:52:57] time of fellowship with them.
[1:53:00] You even don't know whether they know to
[1:53:01] do this or they don't know.
[1:53:04] Like now when you have children at home,
[1:53:08] they don't know how to wash their
[1:53:09] clothes. They don't know how to make
[1:53:11] their bed.
[1:53:13] They don't know how to wash things after
[1:53:15] eating.
[1:53:17] when they finish eating.
[1:53:21] Hey, how are you raising them
[1:53:24] now? When they grow up, maybe in future
[1:53:27] we shall have robots.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; So, you just command the robot, you put
[1:53:32] a program at this time when I finish
[1:53:34] come on the table and pick the things
[1:53:36] but sometimes you may not afford those
[1:53:38] robots.
[1:53:41] How are we raising our children?
[1:53:44] How are we building our houses?
[1:53:47] So the Bible says let us discipline
[1:53:51] know the affairs of your children
[1:53:54] knew the affairs of Esther
[1:53:57] followed step by step
[1:54:00] with Esther all the way.
[1:54:03] Walk with your children all the way.
[1:54:07] You stress yourself to work
[1:54:12] the money you are making. You want to
[1:54:14] raise your children but you're raising
[1:54:16] them without display.
[1:54:19] What will become of them? How are they
[1:54:22] going to have their families?
[1:54:24] Why are they going to work when they
[1:54:27] don't have display? No character.
[1:54:30] So you need to see that you take time as
[1:54:32] a parent
[1:54:35] to find out how your children are doing.
[1:54:39] Who are the friends of your children?
[1:54:42] But maybe you don't care.
[1:54:45] What do their friends spend most of the
[1:54:47] time doing?
[1:54:49] Why do don't your children trust in you?
[1:54:54] See that you find out
[1:54:56] or maybe they have gone far away from
[1:54:58] you? Do you take interest
[1:55:02] where they stay? How they live?
[1:55:07] Do you do sport checks?
[1:55:10] Like now some of the children when they
[1:55:12] go to universities
[1:55:14] or colleges they think they are free
[1:55:18] they want to do whatever they want to
[1:55:20] do.
[1:55:22] Find out where do they stay.
[1:55:26] Is there somebody mature in that area
[1:55:29] to give you a report?
[1:55:36] Because in growth
[1:55:38] we are tutored
[1:55:41] and the tutor has to give a report
[1:55:46] but now your children are without a
[1:55:47] tutor
[1:55:49] or if there is a ttor you are paying
[1:55:52] you only wait for the reports of max
[1:55:57] got 99% ah this is good
[1:56:01] but life is not only Max,
[1:56:06] there are other things about life.
[1:56:09] How are you raising your children?
[1:56:13] They don't know maybe how to pray. Maybe
[1:56:16] they don't know how to pray. Maybe they
[1:56:19] don't know how to read.
[1:56:21] Maybe they don't take interest in the
[1:56:23] things of God.
[1:56:25] As a parent, you're meant to take these
[1:56:27] things to them.
[1:56:30] like Abraham.
[1:56:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Abraham is
[1:56:34] a very good example.
[1:56:37] When God called Abraham
[1:56:40] out of the land of the child,
[1:56:45] praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:56:47] to Genesis chapter 12
[1:56:52] and then verse one.
[1:56:56] The Bible says,
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; "Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, get
[1:57:02] thee out of thy country, and from thy
[1:57:04] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[1:57:07] into a land that I will show thee.
[1:57:22] That was the gospel. Now,
[1:57:25] the way Jeroboam was told,
[1:57:28] I'm giving you the kingdom of Israel.
[1:57:33] Abraham, I'm giving you a land. Then to
[1:57:37] us, I'm giving you salvation.
[1:57:41] Praise the name of our Lord. I'm giving
[1:57:43] you a family.
[1:57:46] the gospel.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm giving you this,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; but one thing you need to do, get out
[1:57:54] from the kindred
[1:57:57] and your father's house and the land I'm
[1:58:00] going to show you."
[1:58:04] Jeroboam was given a house,
[1:58:08] a house of Israel,
[1:58:11] but he failed the house of Israel.
[1:58:15] And God desire to build him a sure
[1:58:17] house.
[1:58:20] The same thing when God gives you
[1:58:22] something,
[1:58:23] his desire
[1:58:25] is to make it better than what it is.
[1:58:29] When he got the earth in a confused
[1:58:31] condition,
[1:58:34] void without form, darkness full of it.
[1:58:40] He wanted to build it into a sure house,
[1:58:45] a garden of Eden.
[1:58:47] But see what stages he took it through.
[1:58:51] We all have got the call of God.
[1:58:55] Come unto me you are heavy laden
[1:58:57] and I'll give you rest. So when you come
[1:59:01] now the question is if you have really
[1:59:03] come to Christ,
[1:59:05] why do you say you don't have rest?
[1:59:09] But he says come at me and I'll give you
[1:59:10] rest. Then there has to be something
[1:59:13] wrong which is happening.
[1:59:15] So God called Abraham.
[1:59:18] And then God told him, I'll make thee of
[1:59:21] a great nation
[1:59:23] and I will bless you and make your name
[1:59:27] great
[1:59:28] and you shall be a blessing.
[1:59:32] The promises
[1:59:34] says come out.
[1:59:36] I'm going to put you here.
[1:59:39] Just follow my instruction.
[1:59:42] I'm going to bless you in everything.
[1:59:44] And that's what the Lord has done the
[1:59:46] same.
[1:59:47] Come unto me. I will take care of you. I
[1:59:51] will protect you. I will meet all your
[1:59:54] needs and then somewhere
[2:00:00] you know you don't exceed.
[2:00:02] These are the things
[2:00:04] you know you were youth.
[2:00:07] It's good to put on.
[2:00:10] How would they know that you are also
[2:00:13] there?
[2:00:19] Praise the name of the Lord. You are
[2:00:21] sliding
[2:00:23] and when you are sliding sometimes you
[2:00:26] can get bruises when you fall down.
[2:00:30] So then he told him in verse,
[2:00:35] so Abraham departed,
[2:00:37] as the Lord had spoken to him.
[2:00:41] Praise the name of our Lord, he obeyed.
[2:00:44] This is what we are meant to do.
[2:00:47] Obey. Praise the name of our Lord. Just
[2:00:50] obey.
[2:00:52] You know like with the servants of Nan
[2:00:56] when Elisha told him, "Go and dip
[2:00:59] yourself seven times in Jordan."
[2:01:03] The man had leprosy,
[2:01:06] inturable leprosy.
[2:01:09] Now he goes to where the healing is
[2:01:12] and is despising instruction.
[2:01:16] And that's the same thing. You can't
[2:01:19] build a sure house
[2:01:21] when you are despising instructions.
[2:01:24] You can't build a good family
[2:01:27] when you put the word of God away.
[2:01:30] You can't be a victorious Christian
[2:01:33] if you don't fully walk by the word of
[2:01:35] the Lord.
[2:01:37] You can't do that.
[2:01:39] So despise
[2:01:43] he would tolerate his
[2:01:48] but not to go down to be washed.
[2:01:51] And some of those conditions we have in
[2:01:53] life
[2:01:55] when a meeting is called
[2:01:59] I don't have time.
[2:02:01] I'm too busy.
[2:02:03] You are despising your cleaning.
[2:02:07] You are despising your victory.
[2:02:10] You are delaying.
[2:02:13] So you end up in a trouble continuously.
[2:02:18] These are simple things
[2:02:21] but you don't want to do them but the
[2:02:24] devil holds you back
[2:02:26] until you are not obedient.
[2:02:29] So Abraham
[2:02:31] went
[2:02:33] and you see now when Abraham got in the
[2:02:35] position God put him in,
[2:02:38] God would always come down
[2:02:42] and have fellowship with Abraham.
[2:02:45] And then God went further and told
[2:02:48] Abraham,
[2:02:50] "Now that you are in this land,
[2:02:54] walk before me
[2:02:56] and be perfect.
[2:02:59] Praise the name of our Lord. He's
[2:03:00] building a sure house.
[2:03:03] He said, "I've called you. I'm going to
[2:03:06] bless you."
[2:03:07] And then Abraham obeyed. He went into
[2:03:11] the land. God kept on coming to commune
[2:03:14] with him. And as time went on, Abraham,
[2:03:18] he got to know more about God.
[2:03:23] And then God said, "Walk before me.
[2:03:28] and be ye perfect.
[2:03:30] Genesis 17:2
[2:03:33] walk before me. In other words, let us
[2:03:36] have a continuous walk.
[2:03:41] Praise the name of our Lord. Don't
[2:03:43] depart from the word of God. Continue
[2:03:46] follow the word of God.
[2:03:49] Let us walk together.
[2:03:51] And then he influences you,
[2:03:54] changes your mind, changes your
[2:03:57] thinking, changes how you talk, changes
[2:04:00] how you make your decisions in every
[2:04:03] aspect of life. You would want to find
[2:04:06] out what is the will of God for
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:11] like David here. Saul,
[2:04:14] God has told him do this. Saul is doing
[2:04:18] foolishly.
[2:04:19] Then then Samuel told
[2:04:23] God has looked for a man
[2:04:27] whose heart is like that of God. And he
[2:04:31] says he has found one.
[2:04:33] And that was David. We need to have the
[2:04:36] heart of God also.
[2:04:38] If we are going to build a
[2:04:42] heart of God with you,
[2:04:44] a heart that trembles at his word.
[2:04:47] Praise the name of Allah. You know the
[2:04:49] prophet Isaiah,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; God was asking,
[2:04:55] "What house will you build me?"
[2:04:58] Let us go and get that scripture.
[2:05:01] What house are you going to build me?
[2:05:04] How do you build a house of God?
[2:05:07] Praise the name of the Lord. Building a
[2:05:10] sure house.
[2:05:13] Praise the name of our Lord. How do we
[2:05:15] do it?
[2:05:17] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us get
[2:05:19] that scripture in the book of Isaiah.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Let me get it here.
[2:05:31] Let me just just bear with me.
[2:05:45] Isaiah chapter 66.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And then we go to verse one.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Thus says the Lord, heaven is
[2:05:58] my throne and the earth is my foottool.
[2:06:01] Where is the house that you build unto
[2:06:04] me? And where is the place of my rest?
[2:06:21] Praise the name of the Lord. God is
[2:06:23] asking where will my dwelling be?
[2:06:29] What house are you going to build me?
[2:06:31] What materials are you going to use?
[2:06:34] I've made all the things.
[2:06:36] That's what the Lord is asking. Then he
[2:06:39] says in verse four, for all these things
[2:06:42] has mine hand made.
[2:06:45] And all those things have been
[2:06:50] says the Lord. So what house will you
[2:06:53] build to the Lord?
[2:06:57] Then he says,
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; "Unto this man will I look,
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; even to him that is poor and of a
[2:07:08] contrite spirit, and trembles at my
[2:07:11] word.
[2:07:24] That's the house you build.
[2:07:26] says, "Have a contrite spirit.
[2:07:29] Have a broken heart.
[2:07:32] Tremble at the word of God." When you
[2:07:35] hear the word of God, you're not
[2:07:36] debating about it.
[2:07:39] You're not kind of in exchanging it for
[2:07:42] something else.
[2:07:44] How do you build your house? What house
[2:07:47] are you going to build for? But he says,
[2:07:50] "This is my design. If you hear my word
[2:07:54] and you tremble at my word, praise the
[2:07:57] name of the Lord. Like Abraham,
[2:08:00] he heard the word. He obeyed and
[2:08:03] followed. He trembled at the word of the
[2:08:05] Lord.
[2:08:07] David, he would not go and venture into
[2:08:10] a battle
[2:08:12] without asking the Lord, Lord, should I
[2:08:14] go ahead, what can I do at this
[2:08:17] condition?
[2:08:19] a man after God's own heart. And that
[2:08:22] should be the same thing with us that
[2:08:24] your heart is always desiring the things
[2:08:27] of God.
[2:08:29] You are building your house,
[2:08:31] a sure house formulated on what the Lord
[2:08:35] has instructed us to do.
[2:08:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Building a
[2:08:40] sure house.
[2:08:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:08:45] message, God has a provided way.
[2:08:49] Brother Brennham says,
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; he says,
[2:09:03] he says, "A few years ago,
[2:09:06] some normal modern witch doctors said
[2:09:15] witch doctors
[2:09:19] Let that baby cry.
[2:09:22] Don't pick it up.
[2:09:24] All things like that.
[2:09:27] Don't let grandma touch it.
[2:09:31] And you know what? They hatched out.
[2:09:34] You see what it is? A juvenile
[2:09:37] delquence.
[2:09:43] A bunch of neurotics.
[2:09:50] God made a baby to be loved.
[2:09:55] That's why he made the mother to love a
[2:09:57] baby.
[2:10:00] That's why we are supposed to be this
[2:10:02] way.
[2:10:04] God made it that way.
[2:10:08] And any time that you upset God's
[2:10:10] program,
[2:10:18] you must remember
[2:10:20] you are wrong
[2:10:22] and will be wrong.
[2:10:24] And as long as you're upsetting God's
[2:10:26] program,
[2:10:29] follow God's program.
[2:10:32] Do it the way God say do it.
[2:10:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Just follow
[2:10:39] what the Lord has said.
[2:10:42] That's what Abraham was doing. That's
[2:10:44] what David was doing. Then you are able
[2:10:47] to build a sure house.
[2:10:50] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:10:52] storms will come, challenges will come
[2:10:56] and the message the world is falling
[2:10:57] apart.
[2:10:59] He says we want everything just
[2:11:04] everything
[2:11:06] so we can take it easy
[2:11:09] and retire
[2:11:12] and take life easy.
[2:11:15] Life wasn't intended to be easy.
[2:11:22] Life is a struggle.
[2:11:26] Anything that has got life is
[2:11:27] struggling.
[2:11:31] Look at the trees. How they struggle.
[2:11:34] Look at everything that has got life. It
[2:11:38] is a struggle. And when we try to get
[2:11:41] some kind of a system
[2:11:44] that takes it easy,
[2:11:47] then we are wrong. We know there is
[2:11:50] something wrong.
[2:11:52] Now just like the Bible say he built a
[2:11:56] house on the rock
[2:11:58] the storms came no storms are coming
[2:12:03] no manner
[2:12:05] know that storms are coming
[2:12:10] struggles of life come
[2:12:13] against your life
[2:12:16] against your family
[2:12:18] they keep on coming but how have you
[2:12:21] built your house. Have you built it on
[2:12:23] sand
[2:12:25] on earth that it cannot stand pressure?
[2:12:31] How are we raising our children?
[2:12:34] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[2:12:36] like sometimes whatever they want you
[2:12:39] just give, you just give.
[2:12:42] How they learn patience.
[2:12:46] Praise the name of our Lord. But the
[2:12:48] children have to go through
[2:12:51] Okay, if I don't have this, can I be
[2:12:54] patient?
[2:12:55] Can I wait for another person? Like when
[2:12:58] they go to schools, can find somebody
[2:13:01] has another thing, the other has another
[2:13:04] thing and then they are meant to learn
[2:13:06] how to live with one another,
[2:13:09] how to live in a society. They're not
[2:13:11] going to live by themselves alone. But
[2:13:14] we live in a community, in a society,
[2:13:17] how are we raising our children?
[2:13:21] yourself.
[2:13:22] Praise the name of our Lord because
[2:13:24] challenges come.
[2:13:27] Joseph was loved by his father.
[2:13:30] But there are challenges Joseph faced.
[2:13:33] How did he handle those challenges,
[2:13:37] loved by the father, had a court of many
[2:13:40] colors.
[2:13:43] The brothers hated him. They sold him
[2:13:46] out. If he was raised badly,
[2:13:51] who would have failed in Egypt.
[2:13:54] But because the father had a character
[2:13:57] built in him,
[2:14:00] he was able to overcome in the
[2:14:01] challenges in Egypt.
[2:14:04] We need to build a sure house. The same
[2:14:07] thing with us. When the challenges of
[2:14:10] life come, is that the time I stop
[2:14:12] coming to church?
[2:14:14] Is that the time I switch off my phone?
[2:14:17] Is that the time I take off?
[2:14:19] How are you building your house?
[2:14:22] Praise the name of the Lord. How are we
[2:14:24] standing?
[2:14:26] Life is a struggle.
[2:14:29] So, you have to learn how to handle
[2:14:31] those challenges.
[2:14:34] When you are rejected once,
[2:14:37] it doesn't mean to be happening all the
[2:14:39] time.
[2:14:41] When they don't give you what you want,
[2:14:44] doesn't mean
[2:14:47] you have given up on that.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; And then there are some people at their
[2:14:50] places of work.
[2:14:52] You know they have challenges at place
[2:14:54] of work.
[2:14:57] But the challenges that they
[2:15:00] on which give you the job.
[2:15:04] If they are not there then why do you be
[2:15:05] employed?
[2:15:08] What user leave you there?
[2:15:10] But they are there
[2:15:13] and then you have to work.
[2:15:17] So life is a struggle.
[2:15:20] Challenges happen in life.
[2:15:23] But then you need to see that you do the
[2:15:25] right thing.
[2:15:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:15:30] message impersonation of Christianity,
[2:15:35] he says,
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I said, I'll be so happy someday when I
[2:15:41] cross over to meet Joseph and shake his
[2:15:43] hand.
[2:15:48] See Daniel and ask him how he felt when
[2:15:50] he was in those lions down there.
[2:15:55] And the pillar of fire stood there
[2:15:59] and held those lions off the night long.
[2:16:04] See the Hebrew children, how they come
[2:16:07] out of the fairy furnish
[2:16:11] with that Pentecostal wind around them,
[2:16:14] railing around,
[2:16:18] keeping the breezes away.
[2:16:21] They had challenges they went through.
[2:16:25] Praise the name of our Lord. And
[2:16:26] sometimes those challenges come
[2:16:29] to prove where do you stand?
[2:16:33] They come in your life. They come in
[2:16:36] your family. They come at your place of
[2:16:38] work. They come in the community where
[2:16:40] you were prove how do you start?
[2:16:44] What really inspired you to this? What
[2:16:48] really attracted you to this?
[2:16:51] Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[2:16:53] said,
[2:16:56] I said, what a wonderful time.
[2:17:00] I said, oh God, Now he was praying
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; if you would ever give me a child
[2:17:09] I will call his name Joseph.
[2:17:14] See he was being actually influenced by
[2:17:17] a Bible example.
[2:17:22] That should be the same thing with us.
[2:17:24] Be influenced by a Bible character.
[2:17:29] Take time. Read about this character.
[2:17:32] Know more about it. Take interest. How
[2:17:36] did Joseph overcome that that
[2:17:41] stripping woman?
[2:17:44] How did Joseph overcome it? He didn't
[2:17:46] say
[2:17:52] I run. And he took off. And there are
[2:17:55] some of those things you just take off.
[2:18:01] For me, I'm strong.
[2:18:05] I can even go to the bar. I don't drink.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; I've abstained from appearance of all
[2:18:12] evil.
[2:18:14] Just leave where sin is
[2:18:17] and just go away
[2:18:20] than being sold into it.
[2:18:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So, we need
[2:18:25] to be influenced by the Bible
[2:18:26] characters.
[2:18:29] Let them influence our lives.
[2:18:33] Look at the examples.
[2:18:36] Jeroboam
[2:18:37] refused to look at David.
[2:18:41] He took his own way.
[2:18:44] But God had promised him. I'm going to
[2:18:48] build you a sure house.
[2:18:51] God fought his battles.
[2:18:53] But Jeroboam
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; said, "No,
[2:18:57] these people when they go away from me,
[2:19:01] they are going to go back and serve
[2:19:03] Judah
[2:19:04] and then they will turn against me and
[2:19:07] kill me." So what did he do? As we
[2:19:10] finish in First Kings chapter 12
[2:19:21] and then verse 25,
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; he says,
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; "Then Jeroboam built Sheckchum in Mount
[2:19:27] Ephraim and dwelt in there and went out
[2:19:30] from then and built Penel. And Jeroboam
[2:19:34] said in his heart, "Now shall the
[2:19:37] kingdom return to the house of David.
[2:19:58] So what did he do? He said in his heart,
[2:20:02] "Ah, these people, if I allow them to be
[2:20:05] going to Jerusalem to worship,
[2:20:10] they will turn against me." So he
[2:20:13] devised a device.
[2:20:16] And you know there are some people
[2:20:18] they deise a device they try to give you
[2:20:22] as if the reason is right
[2:20:25] but the motive behind is bad.
[2:20:32] You know this city is no longer a good
[2:20:33] city.
[2:20:36] Let us go and look somewhere else
[2:20:39] where we be able to build
[2:20:42] and have our own home. But the reason
[2:20:44] may be He's running away from church.
[2:20:51] We are going to be well off that side.
[2:20:53] But he's running away from church.
[2:20:56] Now for you blindly go
[2:21:00] here. So
[2:21:03] he was afraid in his heart and then he
[2:21:06] devises.
[2:21:09] You know you need to check your heart.
[2:21:12] Is your heart after God?
[2:21:16] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[2:21:17] decisions you are making, what is
[2:21:20] influencing you in those decision
[2:21:22] making?
[2:21:25] Because it is a spirit
[2:21:28] and as long as it is a spirit
[2:21:31] to bring to manifestation what exactly
[2:21:32] it is.
[2:21:35] Praise the name of the Lord to bring to
[2:21:37] manifestation.
[2:21:39] It will somehow come out
[2:21:41] but sometimes may come out when it is a
[2:21:44] lot of damage which has been done
[2:21:49] very hard to repair
[2:21:51] very hard to restore
[2:21:54] because you've been nursing a spirit
[2:21:56] over time
[2:22:00] you know okay before we continue with
[2:22:04] let me pick this scripture here
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; in the book of first Corinthians
[2:22:12] Praise the name of our Lord. First
[2:22:15] Corinthians
[2:22:27] chapter 7
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; and then verse 33.
[2:22:33] The Bible says, "But he that is married
[2:22:38] cares for the things that are of the
[2:22:40] world, how he may please his wife.
[2:22:53] between a wife and a virgin. The
[2:22:55] unmarried woman cares for the things of
[2:22:57] the Lord, that she may be holy both in
[2:23:01] body and in spirit. But she that is
[2:23:04] married cares for the things of the
[2:23:06] world, how she may please her husband.
[2:23:32] Now see the Bible says when you marry as
[2:23:36] a wife you're meant to please your
[2:23:38] husband.
[2:23:40] That's what the Bible is saying. When
[2:23:42] you marry as a husband you're meant to
[2:23:46] please your wife.
[2:23:49] And this where now the trouble comes in
[2:23:51] when the wife doesn't want to please the
[2:23:53] husband.
[2:23:55] Satan has options there.
[2:24:03] When the husband doesn't please the
[2:24:05] wife,
[2:24:07] Satan also comes there. He has
[2:24:08] alternatives.
[2:24:12] Like now some people are working
[2:24:16] the wife doesn't attend to the husband
[2:24:21] then you get those women who work
[2:24:24] colleagues
[2:24:26] then they will come and start
[2:24:28] what happened
[2:24:32] sorry
[2:24:36] they just remind you what your wife is
[2:24:37] failing
[2:24:41] but the wife is also busy in her thing.
[2:24:44] But then there are women showing
[2:24:45] concern.
[2:24:48] No,
[2:24:50] that is not good. But anyway,
[2:24:53] there's a place where the things can be
[2:24:55] made well. They giving ideas.
[2:24:59] They approaching us good Samaritans,
[2:25:02] good helpers
[2:25:04] and then the wife is there.
[2:25:09] For me, I'm a married wife with better
[2:25:12] what is going to to change you know and
[2:25:15] then the Satan is also preaching the
[2:25:17] other side
[2:25:19] the heart of the man is being stolen
[2:25:23] because there is a gap here
[2:25:25] the same thing with the wife the husband
[2:25:28] doesn't care then there are those
[2:25:31] serpents who come
[2:25:34] in the time of loneliness
[2:25:37] they come and start preaching
[2:25:41] gap.
[2:25:43] The husband is not pleasing the wife.
[2:25:46] The wife is not pleasing the husband.
[2:25:48] Then the serpent comes
[2:25:52] comes when you are lonely.
[2:25:55] Say no. There is this alternative.
[2:26:00] No. Now today you've been idle.
[2:26:02] Why don't you go and watch some of these
[2:26:04] films?
[2:26:07] You go to
[2:26:10] reading all the time. He comes,
[2:26:14] he gives alternatives.
[2:26:17] Now, your husband has not called you the
[2:26:18] whole week.
[2:26:22] I don't know what's happening to him.
[2:26:24] the children of Israel
[2:26:26] after giving them the law on the
[2:26:28] mountain,
[2:26:30] Moses goes to God
[2:26:33] to bring down the the tables of stone
[2:26:36] and the instructions how they can
[2:26:38] worship
[2:26:40] and then they say
[2:26:44] we don't know what has become of Moses.
[2:26:45] Then the devil started preaching. Satan
[2:26:48] began to stand
[2:26:50] the same thing was doing here.
[2:26:53] And then the Bible says in 2 Coronicles
[2:26:59] and chapter 15
[2:27:04] and verse three.
[2:27:08] Praise the name of the Lord. The Bible
[2:27:11] says
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; now for a long season
[2:27:18] Israel has been without the true God.
[2:27:24] The question is you mean God was not
[2:27:26] there.
[2:27:28] God was not God was there but God was
[2:27:32] not their interest.
[2:27:35] So they were without God a long season.
[2:27:39] And your life can be put in that kind of
[2:27:42] mess
[2:27:44] for the whole day
[2:27:47] you walked without God.
[2:27:51] You've left him at home. And then some
[2:27:53] people for the whole week
[2:27:57] without God
[2:28:00] left him in the church
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; like Mary
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; left Jesus in Jerusalem.
[2:28:05] for a whole day and now they discovered
[2:28:07] it the following day.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; And people get discovered when they in
[2:28:15] troubles.
[2:28:18] Why is this thing happening
[2:28:20] but a long season without God? And then
[2:28:24] the Bible says and without a teaching
[2:28:28] priest.
[2:28:31] But there was the tribe of Le
[2:28:34] who were ordained to be priests.
[2:28:38] But what had happened? They had rejected
[2:28:41] them.
[2:28:42] Jeroboam
[2:28:44] had put them off their work
[2:28:47] and put people not meant to be priests.
[2:28:50] So they were without a teaching
[2:28:53] and without the law.
[2:28:56] Everybody had the lo books and tables of
[2:29:01] but they said we have closed our ears.
[2:29:06] We no longer think of we
[2:29:09] want things that go.
[2:29:12] We want things of this age. That's what
[2:29:15] the devil does.
[2:29:17] God was there. The priests were there.
[2:29:21] The law was there. But that was not
[2:29:23] their business.
[2:29:25] So they were without God in the
[2:29:28] priesthood without the Lord. That can be
[2:29:31] somebody's condition
[2:29:34] in your life. You are without God in
[2:29:38] your family. You are without God. Things
[2:29:41] happen anyhow.
[2:29:44] You don't care what the word of God say.
[2:29:47] You are without the word. You don't care
[2:29:49] what God says. You are without God.
[2:29:53] You just
[2:29:58] what my home
[2:30:01] that's not what rules my life
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; without God without the law without the
[2:30:06] priesthood
[2:30:08] without you make serious decisions
[2:30:12] without asking
[2:30:15] let me consult let me find out from the
[2:30:18] pastor there's this thing I'm thinking
[2:30:20] about how can I go about this they had
[2:30:24] put them aside
[2:30:26] that's the business of Jeroboah
[2:30:30] so now let us go back to first kings
[2:30:33] chapter 12
[2:30:36] and then verse 28
[2:30:39] okay verse yes verse 28
[2:30:43] he says
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; whereupon the king took counsel and made
[2:30:48] two calves of gold and said unto them it
[2:30:52] is too much for you to go up to
[2:30:53] Jerusalem.
[2:30:55] Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought
[2:30:59] you out of the land of Egypt.
[2:31:13] [Music]
[2:31:20] Now we see these are your gods
[2:31:24] and make sure that they are near them.
[2:31:29] He put one of them in
[2:31:33] and another in Bethl.
[2:31:36] Now it is easy
[2:31:40] simplified things.
[2:31:42] You see the things of marrying
[2:31:46] I just get from outside
[2:31:51] we are no longer struggling made things
[2:31:54] easy
[2:31:55] but there's a problem trouble coming
[2:32:00] let me do PCM
[2:32:08] I'll just tell her you just wait for
[2:32:09] some time but troubles
[2:32:15] along the road.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; You may want to turn
[2:32:23] it difficult
[2:32:28] like in the wilderness.
[2:32:30] So the Bible says and he set one in and
[2:32:33] then he said he set one in Bethl
[2:32:37] and the other in Dan.
[2:32:42] And the thing became a sin, for the
[2:32:45] people went to worship before one, even
[2:32:47] unto Dan.
[2:32:59] taken them away from God.
[2:33:02] He has given them an alternative.
[2:33:05] So this is what you need to do. Like
[2:33:07] they tell me in Japan their God is work.
[2:33:14] Until that country
[2:33:17] is not an issue,
[2:33:21] it's about work. until the government
[2:33:25] they have realized that there are more
[2:33:27] people dying than those who are being
[2:33:29] born
[2:33:33] and there are more older people than the
[2:33:34] young ones.
[2:33:38] So they said now we are going to be
[2:33:39] giving you some allowances to socialize.
[2:33:48] You go you go and you know do so you can
[2:33:50] have more children.
[2:33:54] [Music]
[2:33:55] Because they are finding they have no
[2:33:57] future but they are God is work.
[2:34:02] So all the time they on that
[2:34:06] on that
[2:34:08] an alternative.
[2:34:11] So the Bible says and he made a house of
[2:34:14] high places and made priests of the
[2:34:17] lowest of the people which were not of
[2:34:19] the sons of Levi.
[2:34:33] Jeroboam.
[2:34:34] He had an opportunity
[2:34:37] for God to build him a shower house,
[2:34:41] a kingdom that is established
[2:34:44] like the kingdom of David.
[2:34:46] But Satan
[2:34:48] corrupted his mind.
[2:34:51] until he wanted to do things the way of
[2:34:53] the world
[2:34:56] and destruction just came upon his
[2:34:58] family
[2:34:59] and upon the kingdom of Israel.
[2:35:03] Let us build a sure house.
[2:35:06] Praise the name of our Lord. See that
[2:35:08] you do it like like Abraham.
[2:35:12] The Bible says of Abraham
[2:35:15] in Genesis chapter 18,
[2:35:18] praise the name of our Lord. Genesis
[2:35:21] chapter 18
[2:35:23] and then verse 18 and 19.
[2:35:28] The Bible says,
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; let us start from verse 17.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from
[2:35:36] Abraham that thing which I do?"
[2:35:44] You know the Bible says the secret of
[2:35:46] God is with them that fear him.
[2:35:52] When you fear God, he will show you
[2:35:55] things.
[2:35:57] Even things about your life, what you
[2:36:00] need to do, even things about your
[2:36:02] family because you fear God. So he takes
[2:36:05] interest in your life.
[2:36:08] He takes interest in your family. He
[2:36:11] takes interest in your place of work.
[2:36:13] Praise the name of our Lord. So God had
[2:36:16] promised Abraham
[2:36:19] and said, "I have to tell Abraham
[2:36:22] what I'm going to do." Why? Because
[2:36:25] Abraham shall be a great and mighty
[2:36:28] nation and all the nations of the earth
[2:36:31] shall be blessed in him.
[2:36:44] Like now we can say that was now the a
[2:36:46] finished house
[2:36:49] that was the target of God.
[2:36:52] One should become of Abraham.
[2:36:55] Then how will Abraham
[2:36:57] from the land of the child
[2:37:00] to the time of being a father of many
[2:37:02] nations
[2:37:04] and allow us to be blessed of him?
[2:37:07] How is that house going to be built?
[2:37:11] Allow God to be your coworker.
[2:37:15] Walk along with him. Walk before God in
[2:37:19] your life. Walk before God in your
[2:37:22] family. Walk before God. Everything you
[2:37:24] do, walk before God and then you see the
[2:37:27] blessings of God one at a time
[2:37:31] guiding you in this direction. When you
[2:37:33] reach a junction and you don't know what
[2:37:36] to do, God is right there to point you
[2:37:39] where to turn. Pray in the name of Lord.
[2:37:42] Don't use the world to make you tire.
[2:37:45] Don't use the friends make you tire.
[2:37:49] Let therations don't make you tire. But
[2:37:51] say, "Lord, I'm here.
[2:37:54] I am stuck here like
[2:37:57] he reached the well. What next? What
[2:38:01] should I do? I'm at the well.
[2:38:04] Humbled himself. He said, "Lord, I'm at
[2:38:06] the well where the daughters of men come
[2:38:09] to draw. It's not only one person, but
[2:38:13] it's a communal well."
[2:38:18] So he says, "Lord, but guide me." God
[2:38:21] revealed to Elza
[2:38:23] the girl you're going to tell give me
[2:38:26] water to drink and he gives you water to
[2:38:29] drink and then afterwards
[2:38:32] you have not told her to give the
[2:38:34] animals
[2:38:35] then she starts giving the animals
[2:38:38] that is the girl I've chosen for Isa
[2:38:43] had the secret in his heart so then he
[2:38:46] waited
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; and then Rebecca comes oh give me to
[2:38:51] drink. She was not those girls.
[2:38:59] You're an old man. What business you
[2:39:01] have to do with me?
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Daddy, why do you want to to talk to me?
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; You know, she was humble enough.
[2:39:08] You know, there are those you just talk
[2:39:09] to the first time and sparks.
[2:39:15] So, she humbled herself. She gave him
[2:39:18] water
[2:39:19] and then she went and fished for the
[2:39:21] animal.
[2:39:22] He stood at the junction
[2:39:28] and the Lord made him turn right. Praise
[2:39:30] the name of the Lord. So Abraham also
[2:39:34] God is saying I know
[2:39:38] in verse 19 for I know Abraham
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; that he will command his children
[2:39:51] and his Genesis 18:19
[2:39:55] and his household after him and they
[2:39:57] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[2:39:59] justice and judgment that the Lord may
[2:40:02] bring upon Abraham that which he has
[2:40:04] spoken of him.
[2:40:22] How could God make it to pass
[2:40:25] what God has spoken to Abraham?
[2:40:28] Abraham, he had to follow the word of
[2:40:31] God. Abraham, he had to teach his
[2:40:34] children the word of the Lord. He had to
[2:40:36] teach his household the way of the Lord.
[2:40:39] He was building a
[2:40:42] How are you building your house? Praise
[2:40:44] the name of our Lord. How are you
[2:40:46] building your house?
[2:40:48] Abraham taught Isaac how to sacrifice.
[2:40:53] In Genesis 22, Isaac was asking the
[2:40:56] father, "Father, there is fire here,
[2:40:59] there is firewood. But where is the lamb
[2:41:02] sacrifice?"
[2:41:04] He knew
[2:41:06] because the father had taught him. How
[2:41:08] about you? Have you taught your children
[2:41:12] the way of the Lord? Praise the name of
[2:41:14] the Lord. How are you building your
[2:41:16] house?
[2:41:19] We need to build sure houses
[2:41:22] as a family. You need to build a shower
[2:41:24] house. Why would all the goodness
[2:41:29] end on you not come to your children,
[2:41:33] not come to your grandchildren?
[2:41:35] When the Bible says, praise the name of
[2:41:38] our Lord, that a wise man,
[2:41:41] you know, he lives an inheritance for
[2:41:44] his grandchildren.
[2:41:48] That's what the Bible says.
[2:41:50] The Bible says, "A good man,"
[2:41:53] Proverbs 13:22,
[2:42:00] "A good man lives an inheritance
[2:42:04] to his children's children.
[2:42:06] And for you, what have you passed on?
[2:42:12] Everything just died with
[2:42:18] like
[2:42:19] generations destroyed.
[2:42:22] Nothing more to continue.
[2:42:25] We need to build a sure house.
[2:42:28] Obey the word of God. Follow the
[2:42:31] instructions of God. Walk in the light.
[2:42:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us be
[2:42:36] the light of the world.
[2:42:39] May God bless you. Amen.
[2:42:43] Amen. Let us sing that song. We walk in
[2:42:46] the light as the song leader comes.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; So next Sunday we shall have two
[2:42:55] services
[2:42:57] and God willing in the afternoon
[2:43:00] next Sunday I believe we shall have a
[2:43:03] prayer line
[2:43:04] preaching then prayer line after next
[2:43:06] Sunday.
[2:43:08] Or you can come with your requests.
[2:43:11] You can come with your people prayers.
[2:43:14] Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; We walk in the light.

[2:47:52] the strength, Lord. Oh, just give me the
[2:47:57] strength to do every day
[2:48:02] what I have. As we get into a time of
[2:48:05] prayer, yesterday is gone, Lord. Oh,
[2:48:09] yesterday's
[2:48:10] gone,
[2:48:13] sweet Jesus.
[2:48:16] And tomorrow may never be mine.

[2:48:53] every day. Just give me the strength
[2:48:57] that I can build that sure house. Lord,
[2:49:01] what I have to do. Yesterday is gone.
[2:49:06] Lord, give me the grace.
[2:49:08] Yesterday is gone.
[2:49:13] Sweet. Tomorrow may never be mine and
[2:49:16] tomorrow may never. So give me the grace
[2:49:21] Lord that I build that sure house today.
[2:49:24] Oh help me.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Just show me the way one day at a time.
[2:49:39] [Music]
[2:49:48] As we get into a time of prayer now,

[2:50:32] sure house and as an individual.
[2:50:35] I need to build that sure house as a
[2:50:37] family. I need to build that sure house.
[2:50:42] Father, as a church, it is our desire.
[2:50:45] King of glory. Lord, we are so thankful,
[2:50:48] heavenly father, for your word that has
[2:50:51] come to teach us. So heavenly father,
[2:50:54] how we ought to stand on that rock, that
[2:50:57] rock of salvation, Christ himself being
[2:51:01] the foundation. Your word has reminded
[2:51:04] us this morning, King of glory, Lord,
[2:51:07] that we are built on that sure
[2:51:09] foundation of the apostles, the
[2:51:12] prophets, Christ himself being the chief
[2:51:15] cornerstone. Father, how we desire, oh
[2:51:19] God,
[2:51:20] to be led, oh Father, how we desire, oh
[2:51:24] king of glory, that that rejected stone,
[2:51:27] that rejected stone by the world can be
[2:51:31] the chief cornerstone in our lives, oh
[2:51:33] Lord. That we can build our lives on
[2:51:36] Christ. We can build our families on
[2:51:39] Christ. that as a church, oh heavenly
[2:51:42] father, we can stand on no other
[2:51:44] foundation but Christ leading us and
[2:51:48] guiding us every day. Lord, we have
[2:51:51] sung, oh Lord, one day at a time. Oh
[2:51:54] king of glory, perhaps, oh father, we
[2:51:57] might have forsaken that rejected stone
[2:52:01] like the builders. Oh father, perhaps we
[2:52:04] have rejected that chief corner stone in
[2:52:07] our families. Oh Lord, be gracious. Oh
[2:52:10] God, if yesterday is gone, oh God, give
[2:52:14] us the grace today, heavenly father, to
[2:52:17] come back to the principles of the word,
[2:52:19] to come back to think like you, oh
[2:52:22] father, that in every situation, oh God,
[2:52:25] that happens in our lives, Lord, as
[2:52:28] individuals, every situation that
[2:52:31] happens, oh king of glory, in our
[2:52:34] families,
[2:52:35] we may think, oh Lord, what does Christ
[2:52:39] speak about this situation that we can
[2:52:41] go back to your word and inquire from
[2:52:44] you. What does your word speak about
[2:52:47] this situation that as a church oh
[2:52:50] father when we at crossroads oh lord
[2:52:53] when we at junctions of time oh father
[2:52:56] we can go back oh lord to your word you
[2:53:00] send your word oh father and you said
[2:53:04] that the word comes to the prophet
[2:53:06] father you have sent your word to the
[2:53:08] prophet in this age so as a church oh
[2:53:11] king of glory lord we can look back oh

[2:53:17] spoken unto us this day. Giving us oh
[2:53:20] heavenly father the principles oh lord

[2:53:49] may build, oh father, not on any other
[2:53:51] foundation, Lord, but the foundation
[2:53:54] that has been laid, oh heavenly father,
[2:53:57] by the prophets, the foundation, oh
[2:53:59] heavenly father, Lord, that has been
[2:54:01] laid, oh king of glory, in your word, oh

[2:54:07] gracious, oh heavenly father, may we not
[2:54:09] look, oh heavenly father, out there on
[2:54:12] the things of the world, may we not
[2:54:14] look, oh king of glory, Lord God, on
[2:54:17] what our friends Say, "Oh father, may we
