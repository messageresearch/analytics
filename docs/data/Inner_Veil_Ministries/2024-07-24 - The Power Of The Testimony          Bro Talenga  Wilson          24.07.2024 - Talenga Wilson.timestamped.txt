[24:11] evening but we thank God who has helped
[24:13] us to make it to
[24:16] church amen so for our for our study
[24:21] tonight I'll be taking the text short
[24:26] text the power of the
[24:30] testimony praise the Lord the power of
[24:33] the
[24:38] testimony praise the Lord so now we have
[24:41] read we have taken our scripture from
[24:45] Joshua praise the Lord and we know this
[24:47] is a
[24:49] continuation of the Journey of the
[24:51] children of
[24:53] Isel praise the Lord and so now here
[24:56] they reach Jero
[24:58] and Joshua takes out two
[25:01] men to go out spy the
[25:04] land and when they reached there praise
[25:08] the Lord the Bible says that when they
[25:12] got
[25:13] there they reached the house of
[25:17] RAB the
[25:19] harot and when they got there
[25:22] information reached the king of
[25:25] Jero that you're here but the enemy has
[25:30] come the enemy has
[25:33] invaded and when the information reached
[25:36] him he sent out
[25:39] Messengers to go reach out to
[25:42] RAB and when they reached
[25:44] RAB they asked where are the
[25:47] men the men that you are keeping our our
[25:52] enemies and they have come to destroy
[25:55] us and they tried to speak to her
[25:59] so she could give them
[26:00] up but in verse four we notice the
[26:05] response of
[26:07] RAB she knew well she had the two men
[26:10] that had been sent SP the
[26:13] land but she had something compelling
[26:16] her not to give them up praise the Lord
[26:21] why Bible says and the woman took the
[26:24] two
[26:26] men and hid them and said
[26:29] th there came men unto
[26:33] me accepted that she had seen the
[26:37] men but she said she didn't know who
[26:39] they
[26:41] were praise the Lord she couldn't let
[26:44] them
[26:45] go and the B says in
[26:48] verse and it came to
[26:52] pass about the time she's trying narrate
[26:56] she's narrating to The Messengers
[26:58] it came to pass about the time of
[27:00] shutting of the gate when it was dark
[27:03] that the men went out where the men went
[27:07] I what not pursue after them quickly for
[27:10] you shall overtake them
[27:28] the entire nation did not want to
[27:30] receive
[27:32] them they wanted to see them
[27:36] destroyed praise the Living God and now
[27:39] when this woman received
[27:41] them she's pretending like she has not
[27:44] seen
[27:45] them praise the Lord so she says I saw
[27:49] them they
[27:50] came but at the time of closing of the
[27:53] door it was dark so I don't know where
[27:57] they went
[27:58] but they moved out
[28:00] shortly you run after them you be able
[28:03] to find them and you'll capture them and
[28:07] she says but she had brought them up to
[28:09] the roof of the
[28:12] house and hid them with the strocks of
[28:17] FL which had laid in order in order upon
[28:21] the
[28:23] roof and now the men who had been sent
[28:26] by the king
[28:28] they pursued after them the way of
[28:33] Jordan and
[28:35] the and as soon as they which pursued
[28:39] after them were not were gone
[28:44] out they shut the
[28:47] Gat and before they were laid
[28:51] down she came up upon she came up unto
[28:55] unto them upon the roof
[29:00] and she said unto
[29:02] them now this is the
[29:04] reason why RAB would not let go of these
[29:09] two
[29:11] spice she had heard of the
[29:14] testimony she had heard of the work of
[29:18] God she knew who these men
[29:20] were she knew they had brought a message
[29:23] of Destruction upon Jero
[29:28] and so whoever did not receive
[29:30] them she knew whoever didn't receive
[29:34] them would be destroyed at their
[29:37] hands so she was
[29:40] compelled somehow contain them so she
[29:44] could seek of their
[29:46] favor and she said unto the
[29:49] men I know that the Lord has given has
[29:54] given you the
[29:56] land and your terror is Fallen upon
[30:02] us and that all the inhabitants of the
[30:06] land faint because of
[30:10] you that is the testimony she had had
[30:14] about she said I know that the Lord has
[30:17] given you this
[30:19] life and we have heard of what God has
[30:22] how God has dealt with
[30:24] you and how God has dealt with your
[30:27] enemies
[30:28] the word of God has reached out unto
[30:31] us and his wonders has reached out unto
[30:35] us and every one of us is under
[30:40] terror terror is Fallen upon us
[30:44] all and all the inhabitants of the
[30:48] land they all faint because of
[30:52] you praise the Lord that is the
[30:55] testimony she had about
[30:58] and so she couldn't let them
[31:01] go praise the Lord and now it says here
[31:04] in verse
[31:06] 10 for we have heard how the Lord dried
[31:09] up the water of the Red Sea for
[31:16] you praise the Lord she was in there in
[31:21] Jero but she had heard what God had done
[31:24] at the Red Sea
[31:28] so the word of God had
[31:31] spread it had gone before the
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:36] spice God had promised
[31:39] Joshua not to fear and he promised him I
[31:44] will go before
[31:45] you and I will fight for you and now
[31:49] here we see the
[31:50] testimony Raab is
[31:53] speaking he says we've heard how the
[31:56] Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea
[32:00] for when you came out of Egypt and what
[32:04] you did un the two kings of the
[32:08] amorites that were on the other side
[32:12] Jordan
[32:14] and whom you utterly
[32:18] destroyed and as soon as we had had
[32:22] these
[32:24] things she said our hearts did melt
[32:30] they heard they had heard the word of
[32:34] God they had heard of the testimony of
[32:38] God how God had dealt with his people
[32:43] Israel had the hand of the
[32:45] Lord how God had dealt with
[32:49] Israel on their way to
[32:51] Jero and she says we are
[32:54] aright and our hearts did melt when we
[32:58] had what God had done in your
[33:02] MST neither did there remain any more
[33:05] courage in any
[33:07] man because of you for the Lord your
[33:12] God he is God in
[33:15] heaven now this isab testifying about
[33:18] the
[33:20] Lord the Lord she was a
[33:23] harot praise the Lord she was living in
[33:26] a kind of life that was not
[33:30] but yet she had heard about the word of
[33:34] God the Lord the Tes had reached unto
[33:38] her that there is a God above
[33:42] all there is a God who
[33:45] fights praise the Lord heard there is a
[33:48] God powerful than anything that
[33:52] exist and while the rest of
[33:55] Israel was afraid to
[33:58] attack in there when the enemy had heard
[34:03] what God had done the enemy was already
[34:07] AF I saw one here in
[34:10] Jero is testifying
[34:13] saying I know your
[34:15] testimony even before you tell me I
[34:19] heard of the hand of the Lord upon
[34:22] you and we are all
[34:25] afraid and no man has the
[34:29] and everyone is
[34:31] fainted because of you for the Lord your
[34:34] God is called above heaven and in the
[34:38] earth
[34:39] beneath oh what a
[34:41] testimony that they were carrying what
[34:44] the testimony that they that walk with
[34:48] God are carrying praise the Lord they
[34:52] say they had a
[34:54] legacy they had a legacy
[35:00] that God was with
[35:02] them and the enemy was already
[35:06] aright because of the word of their
[35:09] testimony the Lord was with them he had
[35:12] promised to
[35:14] josu
[35:16] promised promised Moses and
[35:18] Aon you would be with them that would
[35:22] give them the land praise the Lord and
[35:25] as they were moving
[35:27] the word went before them before they
[35:31] even reached
[35:32] Jero the word of God had reached
[35:35] there Legacy of the testimony of the
[35:39] word of God has already reached the land
[35:41] of the
[35:42] enem praise the Lord and as long as he
[35:46] is with
[35:47] us as long as his word is with
[35:50] us as long as this this testimony is
[35:53] with
[35:54] us the testimony of the word of God
[35:58] this testimony will spread out the
[36:01] world praise the Lord and we shall see
[36:04] the hand of God walking before the
[36:07] people and by this our
[36:10] testimony the testimony of our
[36:13] Salvation the testimony of the word of
[36:16] God and the power
[36:18] thereof we shall go to all parts of the
[36:23] world to all parts of the
[36:26] Earth and like Raab
[36:29] said that the entire Jero
[36:33] fainted the Earth shall
[36:36] tremble at this spoken word praise the
[36:40] Lord why because this word has
[36:44] power praise the Lord because it is the
[36:46] Lord himself so when Jero heard it they
[36:50] were afraid and they began hunting for
[36:53] the
[36:54] Spice they could not let them spread
[36:56] into account
[36:59] only two men that put the entire nation
[37:03] at
[37:04] stake and the King was
[37:07] afraid and he was very
[37:10] frightened to hear that they have
[37:12] entered
[37:13] his praise the Lord but that is the word
[37:17] of
[37:17] God is so
[37:20] powerful praise the Lord it is so
[37:23] powerful that the YY trembles at the
[37:26] word of God
[37:28] the word of God is so powerful that
[37:31] there is nothing that can stand his
[37:34] presence praise the Lord when the word
[37:37] Goes
[37:38] Forth the Bible calls it very
[37:41] sharp it is too
[37:43] sharp praise the Lord that it cuts and
[37:48] the
[37:49] enemy praise the Lord when he hear that
[37:52] is coming is up because he knows the
[37:56] power that in this
[37:58] world that's why theti Jero was
[38:02] up why they were afri because of the
[38:05] testimony they
[38:07] had that God had done in the midst of
[38:11] Israel and he promised it is written in
[38:15] the Book of Psalms
[38:18] 91 thou sh tread upon the
[38:22] lion
[38:24] and the Young Lion and the
[38:29] dragon thou shall trample under
[38:35] feet praise the Lord because he has set
[38:38] his love upon
[38:40] me therefore will I deliver him I will
[38:45] set him on
[38:46] high because he has known my
[38:49] name he shall call upon me and I will
[38:53] answer I will be with him in
[38:56] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[39:00] with long life will I satisfy
[39:03] him is the word of
[39:05] God to them that
[39:08] believe praise the Lord he says he has
[39:12] set his love upon
[39:14] me therefore I will deliver
[39:17] him I will set him on
[39:19] high because he has known my
[39:22] name the Bible says he shall call upon
[39:25] me
[39:28] and I will answer him so when we call
[39:31] upon him he says I will answer him and
[39:34] he says I will be with him in
[39:37] trouble and I will deliver him and H him
[39:41] that's exactly what God was
[39:44] doing he had sent his word he had given
[39:48] his word to
[39:50] Abraham praise the Lord and say that
[39:54] land will I give upon you
[39:58] and upon those that shall come after
[40:00] you and when he spoke the same word to
[40:04] Moses
[40:05] andon and Joshua praise the Lord God set
[40:11] himself to go before the people so even
[40:15] before they reach the
[40:17] Land There is already fear upon the
[40:21] people why because the word of God had
[40:25] gone before them
[40:27] the word of God had gone before the
[40:30] children of Israel the word of God was
[40:33] before them just like he promised to
[40:37] Joshua he had gone before them he had
[40:40] prepared the land for them much as they
[40:44] were afraid of the people that in Jero
[40:48] God had gone before them to fight for
[40:52] them because that's the promise that had
[40:55] given to Joshua I will fight for you I
[40:59] fight the amorites I fight the canites
[41:03] he said you will fight all the
[41:06] enemies and said stand still
[41:09] Joshua why because his
[41:12] word has power the word of God has power
[41:19] over all our
[41:20] enemies and verse 12
[41:22] says of of the Book of Joshua chapter 2
[41:26] now I pray
[41:29] you this is now RAB after she had come
[41:33] into countenance with that
[41:37] testimony she had seen the
[41:40] testimony which she had now she had seen
[41:44] she saw the people now she brought them
[41:48] in she had this word of God says I am
[41:52] not
[41:53] determined to let go of you praise
[41:58] the same way God met he met God met
[42:02] Jacob when Jacob saw him when he saw God
[42:08] he says I shall not let go of
[42:10] you until you bless me praise the Lord
[42:14] he had gotten the
[42:16] opportunity to come close to God so he
[42:19] could not let go God go
[42:21] away he blessed him and now here is RAB
[42:26] leaving a f the
[42:28] life but when she
[42:30] saw the people who they had talked about
[42:35] when she saw the
[42:38] manifestation of the testimony of the
[42:41] power of God in the people she said I
[42:44] will not let you
[42:46] go praise the Lord even when she was
[42:49] scared of the
[42:50] king she lied to the king in order to
[42:55] receive her testimony
[42:57] from the spies so she says now therefore
[43:00] I pray
[43:02] you swear unto me by the
[43:06] Lord since I have showed you
[43:09] kindness that you will also show
[43:11] kindness unto my father's
[43:15] house praise the Lord now she required
[43:19] of a true
[43:21] token she says give me a true token
[43:27] you and that you will save alive my
[43:32] father was her
[43:34] prayer save her
[43:36] family because she
[43:39] knew that the testimony she
[43:42] had about the hand of God and how God
[43:46] had
[43:47] determined to give over their
[43:50] lands the children of Israel she knew
[43:53] that it is these people
[43:57] her or destroy her she showed them
[44:02] kindness and she requested them she says
[44:05] I pray you now that I've showed you
[44:09] kindness you also show kindness unto my
[44:12] father's
[44:13] house give me a true token that you
[44:16] shall save my
[44:18] father and my mother and my
[44:21] brethren and my
[44:22] sisters and all they that have
[44:29] and deliver our lives from
[44:32] death and the men answered
[44:35] her our life for
[44:41] yours if you not this our
[44:46] business it shall
[44:49] be when the Lord has given us the
[44:53] land that we will deal kindly and truly
[44:56] with you
[45:00] then she let them
[45:03] down she let them
[45:05] down by a C through the
[45:10] window for her house was upon the town
[45:19] wall and she D upon the
[45:25] wall and she said unto them get you to
[45:28] the
[45:29] mountain the pursuers meet
[45:32] you and hide yourselves there three
[45:36] days until the pursuers
[45:40] returned and
[45:42] afterwards may you go your
[45:45] way and the man said unto
[45:48] her we will be
[45:52] blameless of this thine
[45:55] oath which thou has made us
[45:58] swear behold when we come into the
[46:02] land now this is the
[46:05] token that they required of herry that
[46:09] she required of
[46:10] them behold when we come into the
[46:14] land Thou shalt bind this line of
[46:18] scarlet thread in the
[46:22] window which thou did let us down B
[46:29] and thou sh bring thy
[46:34] father and thy mother and
[46:38] thyren and all thy father's
[46:42] household home unto
[46:45] thee they left a
[46:48] token a token to redeem her the
[46:52] house when we come and we look at that
[46:56] token
[46:58] your house will be
[46:59] safe and we shall not destroy
[47:03] you praise the Lord and God has provided
[47:06] us a way of escape from the oncoming
[47:11] storm provided a way for the people to
[47:15] be redeemed so now when they came upon
[47:19] her they were leaving her she request I
[47:23] want a
[47:24] token because I know that is by thy
[47:28] hand of of thy God that I shall find
[47:33] Mercy and I will not be destroy and now
[47:36] they gave her a
[47:38] token praise the Lord they gave her
[47:40] token the Scarlet
[47:43] Threat by which she let them
[47:47] down they said you TI it around the
[47:51] door
[47:52] the and you get your entire
[47:55] house father your mother and all your
[47:59] house and keep them in that was the
[48:04] instruction and the other instruction
[48:06] was do not
[48:08] speak don't speak this
[48:11] the praise the Lord because they had
[48:14] given them they had given her the
[48:17] word it was an
[48:19] assurance for her Redemption so they
[48:22] said do not let it
[48:24] out but they tell you let it out
[48:27] you have
[48:29] broken why it was a
[48:32] secret between her and the spies praise
[48:37] the Lord and remember last Wednesday was
[48:40] say when God was speaking the
[48:43] prophet and was giving him the
[48:46] instructions about the
[48:49] pools on the third pool he told him not
[48:53] to speak not to explain anything
[48:57] why because it was the
[49:00] secret it was the word praise the Lord
[49:04] it was something that was
[49:06] binding it had to be a personal
[49:08] encounter so now this woman has come
[49:12] into an
[49:13] encounter a personal
[49:15] encounter this secret was only given
[49:19] unto her for her Redemption it was a
[49:23] word that was left with her and as long
[49:27] as she kept the word she was safe from
[49:31] the oncoming
[49:32] storm that was coming their way praise
[49:36] the Lord God has given us his word God
[49:39] has given us the spoken word and he has
[49:42] given us his word as long as we keep
[49:45] that
[49:46] word as long as you keep this my word
[49:50] you shall be safe praise the Lord you
[49:54] have heard this word
[49:56] the testimony of the spoken word and we
[50:00] know what God is capable of
[50:02] doing because his word never
[50:05] fails promised that in the last
[50:08] days praise the Lord he shall send us a
[50:12] messenger he shall send us a prophet
[50:15] shall send us a spoken word the word
[50:18] shall be a
[50:19] guide the word that shall help us to
[50:24] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[50:28] and as long as we have this
[50:30] word God is very faithful to his word we
[50:35] receive this Word of Promise and we keep
[50:38] it
[50:39] ourselves God is faithful praise the
[50:42] Lord because he says that when I send
[50:45] out that word praise the Lord that word
[50:49] shall be
[50:50] followed by a great storm shall be
[50:54] followed by fire shall burn like an
[50:58] oven shall burn
[51:00] Earth but he
[51:02] said they praise the Lord that have
[51:06] received this
[51:07] word they that have kept this word they
[51:11] that walk by this word that live by this
[51:14] world prise the lord in that day they
[51:18] shall overcome praise the Lord they
[51:21] shall overcome and they shall not be
[51:24] destroyed by the storm that is coming
[51:28] destroy the world praise the Lord so now
[51:32] Raab says give me a token and the token
[51:36] they gave was the token of the
[51:38] word this word give unto you go get this
[51:44] threat and tie it around your house it
[51:48] is for a token and as long as we see
[51:50] that token we shall not destroy your
[51:54] house praise the Lord
[51:57] when Israel was leaving Egypt God gave
[52:02] them a token and says as long as they
[52:04] see that token I not destroy you and now
[52:08] to ask the gentle
[52:10] Bri God has given us a token the token
[52:14] of the word praise the Lord and as long
[52:17] as the word is there as long as you have
[52:20] the words you shall pass over the
[52:24] oncoming storm that is a promise praise
[52:28] the Lord and his promises never fail
[52:33] praise the Lord so he said give me a
[52:36] token and they gave her a token praise
[52:39] the Lord and God gave us a token he gave
[52:42] Jesus to die on the
[52:44] cross the shed blood cleans all
[52:48] sins praise the Lord and in the evening
[52:51] time said I would send the voice of the
[52:55] spoken word
[52:57] to lead the
[52:58] people and he said when I see the
[53:02] token when I see the blood when we shall
[53:06] see that
[53:07] threat we shall pass over you but he
[53:11] says you have to keep in the
[53:14] house because outside isn't
[53:18] safe and the voice of the seventh
[53:22] angel
[53:24] proclaimed it was calling out the
[53:27] to come out of Jero to get into a saer
[53:31] Zone to come out ofon to get into
[53:35] nothing else but the
[53:38] words because it's only in the words
[53:41] that the bride is
[53:43] safe praise the Lord and says when you
[53:46] get in there when you get into the
[53:49] word keep yourself into the
[53:52] word keep the test of the word
[53:56] over
[53:57] evil it has power over
[54:00] fire because he proved it
[54:02] right in the Old Testament in the old
[54:06] days he proved that his
[54:09] word is powerful and powerful than
[54:13] anything that ever
[54:15] existed when he L Mr
[54:20] sh get into the fire praise the Lord and
[54:24] because of his words
[54:26] could not touch them praise the lord we
[54:29] have seen we have had so many people
[54:33] that have kept the word of God and they
[54:36] been able overcome The Temptations the
[54:42] Trouble Comes their way heard of John
[54:45] the
[54:46] Divine he was
[54:49] boiled the heat the fire could not kill
[54:53] the word of God there
[54:56] kill him why he kept the word when he
[55:01] received the word he never let the word
[55:04] depart kept the word we have received
[55:07] the word of God we have received the
[55:09] message of the hour let's keep in that
[55:13] word let's keep in the message let's
[55:16] keep in the spoken word that's where our
[55:18] self zone
[55:20] is because the Bible says this Earth is
[55:25] going to burn as an
[55:28] oven as an
[55:30] oven and if God spoke it the Earth shall
[55:34] truly burn as
[55:36] and but to them that have received the
[55:39] word the word has the
[55:42] power to keep them from the
[55:45] fire that shall come to destroy this
[55:48] world so now let's keep the
[55:51] words and keep in the words and live by
[55:55] the words for this word is our
[55:59] testimony this word is our
[56:02] testimony praise the Lord Israel the
[56:06] word that they heard that they were to
[56:09] be given that
[56:10] land that was their testimony and as
[56:14] long as they moved by their
[56:16] testimony and they kept that
[56:19] testimony God was
[56:21] obl
[56:23] obligated to go before them
[56:26] the Lord to fight for them and as long
[56:29] as we have the words it is it is God's
[56:33] obligation to go before us to fight for
[56:37] us to overcome for us he says to Joshua
[56:42] don't fear just take me at my
[56:45] word I will go before you and I will
[56:49] fight for you praise the Living God so
[56:52] what we have to as
[56:54] Christians is to keep the word of God
[56:57] the word that we have received for it is
[57:00] our
[57:01] testimony praise the name of living for
[57:04] the scripture says grieve not the holy
[57:07] spirit of
[57:08] God wherein you were you were
[57:11] sealed until the day of your
[57:14] Redemption praise the Lord because that
[57:17] our
[57:18] token that is the word of God that is
[57:22] the token that is given unto us keep
[57:26] inside the
[57:27] house do not move out keep inside the
[57:31] house because the moment you move out of
[57:33] the
[57:34] house it shall eat you
[57:37] up you shall be
[57:39] destroyed by the storm that is coming
[57:43] keep the
[57:45] house and make sure you ENT your
[57:48] house SE under the
[57:50] token as long as they under that
[57:53] token you are safe and we shall not
[57:57] destroy you praise the Lord and as long
[58:00] as we are in his house as long as we are
[58:03] in the
[58:04] world we shall be safe so now the
[58:08] testimony of
[58:10] Israel caused
[58:12] fear in Jero because God was with
[58:16] them they never had their own part
[58:20] fight but the word of their
[58:23] test shook the enemy
[58:26] praise the Lord and God promised us that
[58:29] in the evening time there is a light
[58:33] that shall go forth he never said that
[58:37] the evening time we shall manifest with
[58:41] it but he promised that there is a
[58:44] light and that light is the word of God
[58:48] the the word that brings
[58:50] life upon us the word that brings life
[58:56] Resto us and after it restores us it
[59:00] gives us the Assurance after it has
[59:03] given us the the B of the Holy
[59:05] Spirit which is the seal which is the
[59:09] token praise the Lord so in the evening
[59:12] time which time we know we are living we
[59:16] know we have a
[59:17] token the word of God praise the Lord
[59:21] because God is his own
[59:23] word and as long as we have the word
[59:27] we have the power to defeat the
[59:31] enemy as long as we have the word of God
[59:35] have the power to defeat anything that
[59:38] comes our
[59:39] way as long as have the word of God you
[59:43] have the power to speak things into
[59:46] existence as long as you have the word
[59:48] of God you conquer the enemy because the
[59:52] word of God has the power down every
[59:56] stronghold of the
[59:58] enemy it was the word that went before
[1:00:02] to Jero before they even crossed into
[1:00:06] Jero the word was there and had brought
[1:00:09] the enemy on their
[1:00:11] knees and says nation is
[1:00:15] ight and all their strength is gone
[1:00:19] out and they F upon their

[1:19:41] proposition of overcoming the evil of
[1:19:45] overcoming the World by the word of God
[1:19:49] by the word of our Tony it says in MTH 4
[1:19:54] in Jesus is tempted of the
[1:19:57] devil he overcame the personal
[1:20:01] Temptations of Satan by the word and by
[1:20:04] the word
[1:20:06] only in each of the three major
[1:20:09] trials that that corresponded exactly
[1:20:12] the Temptation Of The Garden of
[1:20:15] Eden the L of the

[1:20:44] the
[1:20:45] word but Jesus
[1:20:48] overcame by the word and right
[1:20:51] now he says let me say that
[1:20:55] this is the only way to be an
[1:20:58] overcomer it is the only way that you
[1:21:01] can
[1:21:02] know if you're

[1:26:03] testifying of God before this woman and
[1:26:07] when she had the testim she received the
[1:26:11] power and the Bible says she could not
[1:26:14] remain
[1:26:15] there but she ran out to go and tell
[1:26:19] others about the word so she ran out
[1:26:24] Lord and it says in verse
[1:26:26] 28 the woman then left her water
[1:26:30] pot and went her way into the
[1:26:33] City and say to the
[1:26:36] men come see a man which told me all
[1:26:41] things that ever I
[1:26:43] did is not this the

[1:26:50] came unto him what was that she had
[1:26:53] received the
[1:26:54] T praise the Lord and the word of God
[1:26:57] had to
[1:26:59] increase praise the Lord had to
[1:27:02] increased so the tesy went out when they
[1:27:06] heard of the T of Jesus they also came
[1:27:10] because it was life andto them the word
[1:27:14] of God is our testimony RAB was a
[1:27:17] witness to it she believed it without
[1:27:21] seeing she said I heard I have heard
[1:27:25] that's enough for me I've heard it she
[1:27:29] was
[1:27:30] persistent she said I
[1:27:33] know we are going to be
[1:27:36] destroyed what can I do show me
[1:27:41] favor let me save my father's
[1:27:45] house praise the Lord she says I know
[1:27:49] the word of God it went out and said
[1:27:54] here must be given over to them and we
[1:27:57] are going to be destroyed it was a
[1:28:00] testimony that there there was coming
[1:28:03] and oncoming
[1:28:04] storm praise the Lord it is a testimony
[1:28:08] the word that we are carrying there is
[1:28:12] coming a storm that is going to
[1:28:16] destroy the world and now here is the
[1:28:19] hot she says I want to save my
[1:28:22] family and the prophet says this
[1:28:25] salot
[1:28:27] Gentile watch all her family she was a
[1:28:32] Believer all her family had to get under
[1:28:36] that scet
[1:28:38] streak
[1:28:40] talken she was a
[1:28:42] gentile praise the Lord they had to go
[1:28:45] under
[1:28:46] it for they would
[1:28:49] perish they had heard of the r of God
[1:28:54] had heard of the displaying signs and
[1:28:55] miracles of god among
[1:28:58] people and they had to receive
[1:29:02] it she had to receive
[1:29:04] it
[1:29:06] God destroying
[1:29:09] Angel was coming they knew it and Joshua
[1:29:14] was that angel they were
[1:29:17] inline praise the Lord and so is every
[1:29:21] nation in the world
[1:29:24] in line of God's
[1:29:27] judgment this little old
[1:29:30] harot she had she had
[1:29:34] heard Faith cometh by
[1:29:37] hearing she said all the country is
[1:29:39] disturbed about you that's
[1:29:42] right now the spies that we are sent in
[1:29:46] there to make arrangements and so forth
[1:29:50] she honored those
[1:29:52] men she wanted to be
[1:29:55] saved I know that you are God that your
[1:29:58] God is
[1:29:59] God I have heard what great things that
[1:30:02] he's
[1:30:04] done I know what he's done to the
[1:30:06] different
[1:30:07] nations and I see that those who accept
[1:30:11] him are
[1:30:13] saved and those who does not accept him
[1:30:17] are
[1:30:18] destroyed but I want to leave she said
[1:30:22] oh my there you are
[1:30:24] I want to leave notice Jero had had what
[1:30:29] God was
[1:30:30] doing but they didn't want to make the
[1:30:33] to take the
[1:30:35] warning and there there isn't a
[1:30:37] denomination in this
[1:30:39] country around but but what's hard what
[1:30:43] God is
[1:30:45] doing they don't want to take the
[1:30:47] warning this great power and signs had
[1:30:50] been
[1:30:52] displayed and he done crossed right
[1:30:54] through the the Dead
[1:30:58] Sea and and made and created things and
[1:31:01] made frogs and
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:06] Ice they know it it was not secret and
[1:31:11] RAB said I have heard
[1:31:13] that I don't want to perish with those
[1:31:18] unbeliever no sir no judgment had to
[1:31:21] follow
[1:31:22] it because they was right in
[1:31:26] line she know it so they made a way for
[1:31:30] her to
[1:31:31] escape they must have believed that
[1:31:34] their own big denomination of Jericho
[1:31:36] was able to resist the wrath of
[1:31:43] God that's what many of them are
[1:31:46] thinking
[1:31:47] today oh surely God W do
[1:31:50] that that's what Satan said to Eve
[1:31:54] surely God
[1:31:56] won't he will he said he
[1:32:00] would he said he would destroy the
[1:32:02] world and surely he will because that's
[1:32:07] what he said he do and that's his words
[1:32:11] except a man be
[1:32:13] born and these signs shall follow them
[1:32:15] that that are
[1:32:17] born this will all man know you are my
[1:32:22] disciples
[1:32:24] for all wanted to do what
[1:32:27] happened they were shut
[1:32:31] up they were shut up because they never
[1:32:37] believed what the spice were
[1:32:41] saying but those that believed and
[1:32:45] received their
[1:32:46] test praise the Lord when the angel was
[1:32:50] passing and the angel that was leading
[1:32:54] praise the Lord he even Joshua when he
[1:32:57] came and passed
[1:32:59] by those that
[1:33:01] believed the word of God those that
[1:33:04] believe the
[1:33:06] testimony they were spared praise the
[1:33:09] Lord RAB and her
[1:33:11] house were spared but the rest of
[1:33:14] Jero was brought
[1:33:17] out said keeping
[1:33:20] those and it shall be that will take
[1:33:23] ever shall go out of the
[1:33:26] doors of thy house into the
[1:33:28] street his blood shall be upon his
[1:33:31] head and will be
[1:33:34] Guiltless whosoever shall be with thee
[1:33:37] in the
[1:33:39] house his blood shall be on our
[1:33:43] head any if any be upon
[1:33:46] him that is the word that they left with
[1:33:49] him praise the lord we must be born
[1:33:52] again and if you you're born again you
[1:33:55] can't be born again unless you've
[1:33:58] accepted the word and if you have
[1:34:01] accepted the word you believe it in your
[1:34:04] heart and you make confession and when
[1:34:07] you make confession you believe Jesus
[1:34:10] Christ and when you believe him receive
[1:34:13] him praise the Lord and when you receive
[1:34:16] him Prophet teaches us that when you
[1:34:20] obey his words and you obey his
[1:34:22] testimony praise the Lord your
[1:34:26] obedience upon your
[1:34:28] obedience God gives the
[1:34:31] token which is the Holy Spirit The Life
[1:34:35] of Christ the life of God in us the life
[1:34:38] of God in the church and as long as the
[1:34:40] life is in
[1:34:42] there we shall not face
[1:34:46] destruction but we shall live praise the
[1:34:49] Lord why that life has the power
[1:34:54] remember Jesus when he had passed
[1:34:57] through Gad when he had reached that mad
[1:35:00] man was in the toms praise the Lord who
[1:35:04] had kept himself in the Toms but the
[1:35:07] Devils were keeping him in
[1:35:09] there he cut himself he was bleeding all
[1:35:14] over he was taken captive and the devil
[1:35:17] had held him Captain but when Jesus
[1:35:20] passed over praise the Lord Devils began
[1:35:24] to
[1:35:26] scream the Devils began to
[1:35:29] tremble why the Devils had had of the
[1:35:32] Tes of
[1:35:33] Jesus that at the feet of Jesus every
[1:35:37] demon was cast out that at the name of
[1:35:41] Jesus the Devils could tremble so they
[1:35:44] cried out and says we know you we've
[1:35:48] heard about you don't destroy us you
[1:35:51] spare us and send us away they were
[1:35:56] crying why because of the name of Jesus
[1:36:00] because of the word of God praise the
[1:36:03] Lord because of the testim of the word
[1:36:05] of God so this word that we have is able
[1:36:09] to cast out
[1:36:11] div div tremble at the name of Jesus so
[1:36:15] if you carry the name of Jesus with you
[1:36:17] the devil shall
[1:36:19] tremble praise the Lord that's why
[1:36:22] sometimes we hear people say those that
[1:36:25] maybe go to worship other gods and go to
[1:36:29] in of other gods you hear them say that
[1:36:33] man he has a fire around him you don't
[1:36:37] joke with him you don't play with him
[1:36:41] they say he has a fire around him let me
[1:36:43] give you this testimony as I close let
[1:36:46] me give you this
[1:36:47] testimony about the word of God praise
[1:36:51] the lord we have a case
[1:36:54] that is in the court a case about one of
[1:36:57] our
[1:36:58] companies and now the other the
[1:37:04] respondents we the
[1:37:06] applicants The respondent Who offended
[1:37:11] us he spends day and
[1:37:15] night those which doctors and
[1:37:20] shrines praise the Lord and now I told
[1:37:23] my other
[1:37:24] people that we have a God who will fight
[1:37:28] for us we are at the right side of the
[1:37:31] law and by all means we shall win this
[1:37:35] case so now the first
[1:37:38] appearing of the hearing of the first
[1:37:41] application at the court I didn't future
[1:37:45] there and now this the the
[1:37:49] respondent he carried along two men from
[1:37:52] from after coming there is that
[1:37:56] District they were doctors they were
[1:37:59] outside the
[1:38:01] chambers and they had read the different
[1:38:03] the different
[1:38:05] applications bring people to the
[1:38:08] chambers and now the clar was wondering
[1:38:11] who these men
[1:38:13] are because they didn't have the lawyer
[1:38:17] they were not moving at all and now ours
[1:38:20] was the last group when they called us
[1:38:24] our team went in and the men remained
[1:38:26] there and they had a
[1:38:29] back praise the Lord And now when we
[1:38:32] they came out they
[1:38:34] testified to their
[1:38:36] person they said those people are
[1:38:41] illuminatis they have fire they have a
[1:38:44] fire around them when we are here we saw
[1:38:48] there was fire they wanted to confuse
[1:38:51] the judge
[1:38:53] speak in their favor but the judge was
[1:38:56] the judge was in our favor and they said
[1:38:59] they have the super
[1:39:01] Illuminati but we are going back we are
[1:39:04] going to show them next time so then the
[1:39:07] next hearing after two
[1:39:09] weeks this time I
[1:39:11] futured it was a Wednesday and I Was
[1:39:15] preparing to come and and preach so at
[1:39:18] 2:00 they called us so this my futureed
[1:39:22] and I was praying
[1:39:24] I was meditating and still these men
[1:39:27] came this time they were with a woman
[1:39:30] they still came to show their
[1:39:32] power praise the Lord and we were there
[1:39:36] I had the
[1:39:37] application the lawyers
[1:39:39] responded and I noticed that at some
[1:39:43] point our our judge the
[1:39:46] judge was getting
[1:39:49] confused was mixing up the law
[1:39:53] not appreciate his
[1:39:55] position they were they were they were
[1:39:57] trying the respondent was was trying to
[1:40:00] to challenge
[1:40:03] him saying no you don't have the powers
[1:40:07] right
[1:40:08] now to Pride over this
[1:40:12] case is a
[1:40:16] riew so you must send it over to the to
[1:40:18] the Justice of the high
[1:40:20] court and now he was confused
[1:40:24] yet he knew he had a mandate to Pride
[1:40:27] over I knew something was wrong and I
[1:40:31] spoke a word I says God you know what is
[1:40:35] happening take control over the judge
[1:40:38] and bring him to his position and I
[1:40:41] moved out and I said the judge I seek a
[1:40:46] live with my lawyer i s with my
[1:40:50] lawyer for five minutes to speak to him
[1:40:54] then I told the lawyer out there is
[1:40:56] something wrong with the judge
[1:40:59] mainos by the time we came in the judge
[1:41:02] had regained his
[1:41:04] Consciousness and presided over and he
[1:41:07] gave a
[1:41:09] ruling in our favor and when we came out
[1:41:13] I saw the two men and I saw the lady and
[1:41:17] now the following day again the message
[1:41:20] came they said those people of that
[1:41:22] company
[1:41:24] they are
[1:41:25] illuminatis they have fire around them
[1:41:29] praise the Lord and they mentioned names
[1:41:32] they says they have this lawyer but they
[1:41:35] have this person here that person is
[1:41:37] that Illuminati because he has fire the
[1:41:41] is confused when he saw fire in the
[1:41:45] chambers when he saw fire around us was
[1:41:49] a testimony that as long as we carry the
[1:41:51] word of God there is fire around us and
[1:41:56] that fire is able to burn up the
[1:42:00] enemy they could not overcome they could
[1:42:03] not overtake us why because of one word
[1:42:07] that I spoke I say God take over the
[1:42:11] judge and let him regain his conscious
[1:42:14] and God established it and we won the
[1:42:17] case praise the Lord a testimony to show
[1:42:21] that the enemy
