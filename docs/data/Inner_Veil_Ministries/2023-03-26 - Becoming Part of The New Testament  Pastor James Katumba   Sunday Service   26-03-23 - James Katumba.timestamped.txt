[50:31] [Music]
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:34] [Music]
[50:44] we go to Matthew chapter 26
[50:49] and then verse 26
[50:52] up to verse 29
[50:55] so the scripture says
[50:59] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[51:03] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[51:07] the disciples and said take it this is
[51:10] my body yes
[51:22] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[51:27] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[51:30] it
[51:31] not always
[51:38] for this is my blood of the new
[51:41] testament which is shared for
[51:44] many for the remission of sins
[51:58] but I say unto you I will not drink
[52:01] henceforth of this fruit of the vine
[52:03] until that day when I drink it
[52:06] new with you in my father's Kingdom
[52:10] series
[52:25] Lord we thank you for the reading of the
[52:27] world
[52:28] now call Upon Your Name Lord
[52:32] the Holy Spirit these scriptures
[52:35] may come Lord and make them
[52:39] known unto us
[52:42] as we have need of today
[52:45] bless our hearts all together
[52:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:53] amen amen you may be seated
[52:59] so I want to preach on the subject
[53:02] becoming part of the New Testament okay
[53:08] first we want to appreciate brother
[53:11] Wilson
[53:12] for the Sunday School Sunday school
[53:15] praise the name of our Lord and I just
[53:17] pray that we do better on our coming to
[53:20] church area
[53:24] that we may not miss any activity of the
[53:27] church
[53:31] I also forgot to tell you that from
[53:34] Wednesday I was away
[53:37] on Wednesday I was preaching in its
[53:40] District
[53:43] then on Thursday I was
[53:46] preaching's District
[53:57] I was in those areas foreign
[55:08] so now here in Matthew 26 verse 28.
[55:14] it says for this is the blood of the new
[55:17] testament
[55:19] which is shared for many for the
[55:21] remission of sins
[55:24] praise the name of our Lord so I want to
[55:27] preach on the subject
[55:29] becoming part of the New Testament
[55:33] praise the name of our Lord how do you
[55:36] become part of the New Testament
[55:39] and you know many people
[55:42] because they see that Jesus came
[55:46] yesterday and when Jesus came yes and we
[55:49] see that the New Testament
[55:52] praise the name of our Lord when you
[55:54] read in Matthew chapter one
[55:58] and then verse
[56:01] it says the book of the generation of
[56:04] Jesus Christ
[56:06] the son of David the son of Abraham so
[56:12] it starts with Jesus Christ himself
[56:15] praise the name of Allah so now people
[56:18] think that because Jesus came
[56:21] so they are also automatically in the
[56:24] New Testament
[56:26] but the New Testament is a convenience
[56:31] praise the name of Allah the New
[56:33] Testament is an agreement
[56:37] and you see an agreement
[56:41] you have to also agree
[56:44] to be part of it
[56:47] praise the name of Allah you know when
[56:49] when somebody is selling their land
[56:53] you know they write about who is sailing
[56:57] who is
[56:59] how much money is this person
[57:02] what is the size of the land
[57:05] who are the neighbors around
[57:07] where is the land located
[57:10] it's maybe on this plot in this Village
[57:15] or in this District here there are
[57:18] details in that agreement
[57:21] so even our God
[57:23] doesn't enjoying us to his convenience
[57:27] without first introducing to us his
[57:30] testimony
[57:34] he introduces to us that Covenant
[57:37] president
[58:09] and the seventh Elders of Israel and
[58:12] worship you are far off
[58:20] and Moses alone shall come near the Lord
[58:23] but you shall not come nigh neither
[58:27] shall the people go up with him
[58:35] so now in verse he says and Moses came
[58:39] and told the people
[58:42] all the words of the Lord
[58:46] and all the judgments and all the people
[58:50] answered with one voice
[58:55] all the ones which the Lord has said
[58:58] we will do now we see here Moses was
[59:03] making a testament
[59:07] with the children of Israel and joining
[59:11] them to the Lord
[59:13] but before Moses would enjoying the
[59:17] children of Israel
[59:24] [Music]
[59:27] he came and read to all the people
[59:31] now the words of the Lord and the
[59:35] judgments
[59:37] what does this mean he came and read to
[59:41] them Exodus chapter 20.
[59:45] which talks about the ten commands
[59:48] and then after telling them
[59:51] he told them the judgments for each
[59:54] commandment
[59:56] and if and then so he told them Exodus
[1:00:00] chapter 20.
[1:00:01] Exodus chapter 21.
[1:00:05] praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:09] so he wrote them all these things he
[1:00:13] made them known unto them
[1:00:15] and then the Bible says and all the
[1:00:19] people answer
[1:00:35] let us go to Romans
[1:00:39] foreign
[1:00:46] and then here we start from the verse
[1:00:52] 14.
[1:00:55] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:00:59] they have not believed
[1:01:03] and thou shall they believe in him of
[1:01:06] whom they have not heard
[1:01:09] and thou shalt they hear without a
[1:01:12] preacher
[1:01:15] so then here Moses was sent to them and
[1:01:20] when Moses was sent to them he was sent
[1:01:23] with a gospel
[1:01:25] he was sent with the word so then he
[1:01:29] comes with the word and then he
[1:01:32] ministers the word of God unto them
[1:01:35] and now when these people hear the words
[1:01:38] then they say all that the Lord has said
[1:01:42] we will do the same pattern on the day
[1:01:46] of Pentecost
[1:01:47] Peter comes and preaches to these people
[1:01:50] who are gathered there on the day
[1:01:54] and tell them about Jesus Christ
[1:01:59] how we should die and now we should
[1:02:02] research and now we should take away the
[1:02:04] sins
[1:02:05] and now when these people
[1:02:08] the word of the news
[1:02:14] what shall we do praise the name of our
[1:02:17] Lord in the same format in the Old
[1:02:20] Testament when we go back to Exodus
[1:02:23] chapter 24.
[1:02:25] the people heard the words of Moses I
[1:02:29] said all the ones which the Lord has
[1:02:31] said
[1:02:32] we will do so what is it they have known
[1:02:36] The Testament
[1:02:38] they have known the contents of the
[1:02:40] testimony
[1:02:43] and even the same thing
[1:02:47] you know you get to know the information
[1:02:50] about the property
[1:02:53] and then when you are contented about
[1:02:55] everything
[1:02:56] then you proceed father
[1:02:59] to endorse it
[1:03:03] you know to to sign on it to own it
[1:03:09] now when you go to Exodus chapter
[1:03:34] young men of the children of Israel
[1:03:38] which is
[1:03:43] offerings of oxen unto the Lord never
[1:03:46] were you everywhere
[1:03:50] and Moses took half of the blood
[1:03:53] and put it in person
[1:03:57] and half of the blood is sprinkled on
[1:03:59] the altars
[1:04:02] and he took the book of the convenience
[1:04:06] and read it in the audience of the
[1:04:09] people
[1:04:10] and they say
[1:04:13] [Applause]
[1:04:18] and be obey
[1:05:17] the Bible says
[1:05:22] when the people had accepted the
[1:05:25] convenience
[1:05:27] Supreme Court the blood upon them
[1:05:31] and he sprinkled the blood upon the
[1:05:33] books
[1:05:37] then he says in verse 8. and Moses took
[1:05:42] the blood Moses
[1:05:51] which the Lord has made with you
[1:05:54] concerning all these words
[1:06:03] foreign
[1:06:14] so here the scripture says
[1:06:21] for when Moses had every precept to all
[1:06:24] the people according to the law he took
[1:06:27] the blood of Curves and gods with water
[1:06:30] and Scarlet wool and high soap and
[1:06:33] sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:06:36] people
[1:06:39] foreign
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:07:07] which God has enjoined
[1:07:17] moreover his sprinkled with blood both
[1:07:20] the Tabernacle and all the vessels of
[1:07:23] the ministry
[1:07:29] um praise the name of our Lord so he
[1:07:33] sprinkled the blood
[1:07:35] on the book of The Testament
[1:07:38] and on the people in an equivalent to
[1:07:40] make them part of the Testament
[1:07:44] praise the name of Allah so in the Old
[1:07:47] Testament the children of Israel were
[1:07:51] enjoying to The Testament
[1:07:54] by the blood of animals
[1:07:57] praise the name of our Lord in the New
[1:08:00] Testament
[1:08:01] we are enjoying together we become part
[1:08:05] of the New Testament
[1:08:07] by the same way by the blood of Jesus
[1:08:11] Christ
[1:08:13] we become part of the New Testament
[1:08:17] foreign
[1:08:37] let us start from verse 32.
[1:08:40] this this Jesus has God raised up
[1:08:44] whereof we are all Witnesses
[1:08:47] yes
[1:08:53] therefore being by the right hand of God
[1:08:56] exalted and having received of the
[1:09:00] Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:03] has shared forth this which you now see
[1:09:07] and hear our way
[1:09:24] for this David is not ascended into the
[1:09:27] heavens but he has saved himself the
[1:09:31] Lord said unto my Lord sit on my right
[1:09:35] hand
[1:09:44] until I make the foreign
[1:09:55] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:09:58] know assuredly that God has made the
[1:10:01] same Jesus whom you have crucified both
[1:10:04] Lord and Christ
[1:10:06] is
[1:10:15] the name of Allah so then Peter here was
[1:10:19] introducing to them
[1:10:21] the New Testament
[1:10:23] so then for you to be part of the New
[1:10:26] Testament
[1:10:27] you must first hear the content of the
[1:10:31] Testaments
[1:10:33] what is the word of The Testament
[1:10:37] you must hear it for yourself when you
[1:10:41] hear that word when you believe that one
[1:10:44] you received that one now when you
[1:10:48] believe that
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:47] he says what
[1:11:50] the New Testament
[1:11:52] means New Covenant
[1:12:12] of what Jesus Christ has raised from the
[1:12:17] dead yes
[1:12:20] show that Jesus has met every
[1:12:23] requirement for us yes yes
[1:12:28] and is alive today
[1:12:31] the token proves is alive
[1:12:35] to identify himself with us
[1:12:40] according to his promise
[1:12:43] praise the name of our Lord so the New
[1:12:46] Testament is the Holy Ghost Testament
[1:12:51] so now to be part of the New Testament
[1:12:56] it means that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:59] it means that you have accepted into
[1:13:04] akiriza the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:13:07] take away your sins and now when the
[1:13:11] blood has taken away
[1:13:12] you have also received the life from the
[1:13:18] black praise the name of Allah because
[1:13:21] the blood has the life
[1:13:23] so now if God has remitted yourself
[1:13:27] then you should also have the Life of
[1:13:30] Christ
[1:13:34] and this is what Peter was
[1:14:20] by receiving the spirit of God
[1:14:23] by receiving a new life by receiving the
[1:14:27] life of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus
[1:14:30] himself
[1:14:32] then you can confidently saying
[1:15:34] I know so even now in the new Texas
[1:15:40] you receive the word of God after
[1:15:43] receiving the words
[1:15:45] you accept it when you accept it you
[1:15:50] repent you are baptized in the name of
[1:15:53] Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:15:55] yourself and then you receive the gift
[1:15:58] of God
[1:15:59] praise the name of Allah as a
[1:16:02] confirmation
[1:16:04] that you are in the New Testament
[1:16:07] praise the name of Allah and that should
[1:16:10] always be our hearts desire
[1:16:14] if I have received Christ
[1:16:18] I need also to have the life
[1:16:23] if you have repented of the other things
[1:16:25] why do you go back to the same way why
[1:16:29] don't you deny the nature of sin right
[1:16:31] away why don't you get away from the
[1:16:34] things that are right over
[1:16:46] that we surrender ourselves
[1:16:51] for the life of Jesus Christ to be
[1:16:55] effective in us
[1:16:58] for the life of Jesus Christ to be
[1:17:02] completely taking a hold of our lives
[1:17:08] but you see a challenge that we have
[1:17:10] something
[1:17:12] people don't thoroughly repent Advance
[1:17:16] they won't hold something by themselves
[1:17:37] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ for the remission of sins
[1:17:44] there is no uncertain about that
[1:17:49] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:17:52] ghosts
[1:17:56] maybe you win perhapsuna
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:07] is emphasizing it it is
[1:18:13] if you really repent and then you are
[1:18:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:19] through the scripture says
[1:18:22] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:18:28] ghosts
[1:18:33] but it says
[1:18:37] when when you've repented
[1:18:42] you go you go in there without repenting
[1:18:48] and you won't get it for now I don't
[1:18:52] know why you're not broadcasting that
[1:18:53] quote
[1:18:54] but when you started repentance
[1:18:58] and Believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:19:02] Christ
[1:19:03] but when you started a repentance and
[1:19:07] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:10] you are going to get it
[1:19:13] are you hearing he says when you salary
[1:19:17] and Believe on the Lord Jesus I'm saying
[1:19:21] well yes you are going to get it for now
[1:19:25] so then when you want to be part of the
[1:19:29] New Testament
[1:19:30] they determined to be part of it
[1:19:34] praise the name of Allah not changing
[1:19:37] churches not having new ideas
[1:19:43] turn yourself from away from the things
[1:19:46] of the world
[1:19:47] and you fully accept the Lord you know
[1:19:51] you repent and turn your back away from
[1:19:55] it
[1:19:57] is
[1:19:59] just like the two sons the scripture
[1:20:03] says
[1:20:05] he went to the first
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:47] the question
[1:21:47] receive my life
[1:22:04] they didn't consider you know their
[1:22:06] failures and weaknesses
[1:22:10] we can make it
[1:22:12] praise the name of Allah they were like
[1:22:15] those lepers
[1:22:16] in the days of samaris when there was
[1:22:20] swimming all over the land praise the
[1:22:22] name of us when those lepers told one
[1:22:26] another let us go to the camp of this so
[1:22:30] they never considered you know they are
[1:22:32] leprosy all their infirmities
[1:23:48] so your sins be as Scarlet baby
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:54] shall be whiters
[1:24:08] you shall eat the good of them
[1:24:16] the scriptures
[1:24:22] so they'd be like red like Crimson
[1:24:27] they shall be like
[1:24:30] praise the name of them so you see the
[1:24:33] blood of Jesus Christ takes away all our
[1:24:36] pasties
[1:24:38] and it also takes away our present sins
[1:24:44] praise the name of our Lord it took away
[1:24:47] all your past sins when you
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:51] it changes your character
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:57] foreign
[1:26:05] now I want to read in this message
[1:26:09] praise the name of our lord it's in the
[1:26:11] Cod
[1:26:14] he says I don't care how dark the night
[1:26:17] is I'm coming to Father it might be so
[1:26:20] dark
[1:26:21] till you could feel it
[1:26:25] you could put your hands up
[1:26:30] like this and could not see a shadow of
[1:26:34] no type
[1:26:36] then this little bit of light
[1:26:39] will expose that Darkness
[1:26:43] certainly that's the way life does in
[1:26:46] the presence of death
[1:26:49] that's the way life does in the presence
[1:26:52] of Rome
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:56] that's the way Faith does
[1:26:58] in the presence
[1:27:04] so you need to have that little faith as
[1:27:07] a mustard seed
[1:27:09] foreign
[1:27:54] Abraham restored Ibrahimovic when you
[1:27:58] have that list little tinkling in your
[1:28:01] heart
[1:28:05] for Christ
[1:28:06] you do it right away
[1:28:10] because that is the greatest thing of
[1:28:15] color that ever happened to you that is
[1:28:21] for God to call you
[1:28:24] to the wedding supper of his son
[1:28:28] I don't know anything greater yo so when
[1:28:32] you hear the chords
[1:28:35] go to my garden maybe it was two weeks
[1:28:39] maybe was failing a lot but he turned
[1:28:43] and went
[1:28:44] he was not like the Pharisees
[1:28:47] praise the name of Allah but he accepted
[1:28:50] the calling we also need to do the same
[1:28:53] thing to receive them
[1:28:58] praise the name of it so then we need to
[1:29:02] see that when we receive the world
[1:29:05] so let us thoroughly repent
[1:29:09] praise the name of Allah with all your
[1:29:12] hearts
[1:29:14] praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:29:16] telling God I'm sure I'll accept my
[1:29:19] failure I'm sure I'll accept my sins
[1:29:24] when the prophet Nathan came to him
[1:29:27] in Psalms 51.
[1:29:30] let us go there yeah
[1:29:33] Psalms 51 and verse 1.
[1:29:36] the scripture says
[1:29:39] have mercy upon me o oh
[1:29:43] according to thy loving kind
[1:29:45] according
[1:29:51] transgressions
[1:29:58] me from my sins
[1:30:04] my sin is foreign
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:24] is the same one
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:57] you also need to get
[1:32:00] for
[1:32:08] eign but you need to believe that as I
[1:32:11] have repented
[1:32:14] praise the name of Allah you just need
[1:32:17] to have faith
[1:32:19] like last time we were seeing because
[1:32:21] that they were applying the Blood
[1:32:25] using High soap
[1:32:28] and you can get this with everywhere
[1:32:31] what God requires of us is
[1:32:37] praise the name of us so when you hear
[1:32:40] the words
[1:32:44] that is mine it's not for someone I'm
[1:32:48] receiving this word for myself and then
[1:32:51] the word transforms the word changes
[1:32:56] that's how it works
[1:32:59] praise the name of Allah you know the
[1:33:01] Pharisees when they come to John
[1:33:05] the Baptista they asked him who are you
[1:33:10] accordingly
[1:33:12] when they come to Jesus
[1:33:14] who gave you that Authority
[1:33:18] but when the publicans and the Sinners
[1:33:20] come to jump
[1:33:23] what shall we do
[1:33:26] total difference
[1:33:29] is depending upon himself righteousness
[1:33:34] are you preaching to us
[1:33:38] what is your level of Education where do
[1:33:41] you come from but the one who wants it
[1:33:44] what shall we do
[1:33:48] a right attitude
[1:33:50] praise the name of Allah they came with
[1:33:52] the right attitude so they were able to
[1:33:55] receive delivery they were to receive
[1:33:58] forgiveness
[1:34:02] who are you what are your credentials no
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:17] I'm anointed
[1:34:21] no but he said Lord have sinned against
[1:34:25] you I'm not against you only today
[1:34:31] so we need to learn how to thoroughly
[1:34:37] repentance
[1:34:43] you know there are some people
[1:34:45] praise the name of our Lord like I ever
[1:34:48] saw it somewhere somebody came in a
[1:34:51] meeting and started talking all the
[1:34:54] dirty things he was doing
[1:34:58] no that that's not what I'm talking
[1:35:00] about
[1:35:02] you come before and tell them which
[1:35:06] doctor how you used to get eggs I used
[1:35:09] to get these things broken bottles or
[1:35:12] broken
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:14] we don't want those narratives
[1:35:17] because even the Bible says it is a
[1:35:20] shame to speak about these things
[1:35:23] which are done in darkness that's what
[1:35:26] the scripture says and the scripture
[1:35:29] says even communication be corrupt so
[1:35:34] you find that you're destroying
[1:35:35] somebody's mind
[1:35:39] but if you are coming to repent before
[1:35:42] just say Lord has delivered me
[1:35:46] from maybe this evil don't point to the
[1:35:49] details
[1:35:51] praise the name of Allah and then praise
[1:35:55] the name of Allah if you have done it
[1:35:57] against the Lord you do it before the
[1:36:00] Lord you repent it in your prayer time
[1:36:25] let us continue in Psalms 51.
[1:36:30] and then verse 16.
[1:36:33] he says for your desire not sacrifice
[1:36:36] else I would give it you desire not
[1:36:40] you'd like
[1:36:41] you'd like band offering everywhere
[1:36:53] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:36:56] spirit
[1:36:58] a broken and the contrite heart oh God
[1:37:01] thou will not despise
[1:37:11] so the scripture is telling us the
[1:37:15] sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit
[1:37:20] a broken and a contrite heart
[1:37:24] oh God you will not despise
[1:37:29] the sacrifice
[1:37:32] a broken Spirit
[1:37:35] a broken and a contrite heart um
[1:37:42] one which is sincere before God
[1:37:46] you know you have broken the Stony heart
[1:37:49] condition out of your heart
[1:37:54] you are not you are not hiding anything
[1:37:58] no you are being sincere
[1:38:02] you know when like in the Old Testament
[1:38:05] when they had the word they said all
[1:38:09] that is saying
[1:38:11] we will do now they were doing they were
[1:38:15] confessing
[1:38:16] in their own in let me say in the
[1:38:19] ability of man
[1:38:21] but then you see that in the Old
[1:38:24] Testament
[1:38:25] after Moses making a covenant
[1:38:30] with them thank you
[1:38:33] and the first Commandments
[1:38:35] the first the first the first kind of
[1:38:39] article of the Covenant
[1:38:43] you shall have no other gods before me
[1:38:47] then the second commandment
[1:38:50] you shall not worship them foreign
[1:38:54] statements of the convenience
[1:38:58] even if you before you finish reading
[1:39:01] the whole documentary you started with
[1:39:03] these ones before you okay but now when
[1:39:06] Moses went to the mountains
[1:39:09] and he was there for a number of days
[1:39:13] 40 days
[1:39:15] why did the children of Israel do they
[1:39:19] went we don't know what has become of
[1:39:22] this month
[1:39:25] make us gods
[1:39:28] they were breaking the Covenant they had
[1:39:30] met
[1:39:32] but now this Covenant of the the New
[1:39:36] Testament
[1:39:40] s made by the blood of animals
[1:39:42] so the life of animals would not come on
[1:39:46] the worshipers
[1:39:50] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] comes down to the worshipers and that
[1:39:57] should be your honest desire is that as
[1:40:00] you repent
[1:40:03] fill me with your holy spirit
[1:40:05] let your life come down
[1:40:08] so when the life comes down in you you
[1:40:12] are not going to go back to the things
[1:40:14] you left
[1:40:15] you're not going to have the love of the
[1:40:18] things of the world you're not going to
[1:40:20] go back to things which are not right
[1:40:22] before
[1:40:24] there is a newness of life
[1:40:27] you have turned your back the things of
[1:40:29] the world
[1:40:31] right because the life of Jesus Christ
[1:40:33] lives
[1:40:38] of animals not come on the worship but
[1:40:42] in the New Testament The Life of Christ
[1:40:45] comes down in the heart of the worship
[1:40:48] praise the name of Allah so it creates
[1:40:51] you it makes your new creation
[1:40:54] so when we come
[1:40:57] you need to
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:04] knitting how to be sincere
[1:41:07] Lord have my support now if you have
[1:41:11] accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:14] you have confessed to him you need to be
[1:41:18] baptized with the name of Jesus
[1:41:21] you need to be baptized in water
[1:41:24] you need to be immersed in what way the
[1:41:28] scripture says in Acts chapter 2
[1:41:31] and then verse 38.
[1:41:34] praise the name of our Lord Acts 2 38.
[1:41:43] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:41:46] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:41:50] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:41:52] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:41:55] Holy ghosts
[1:42:00] um
[1:42:03] foreign
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:19] it's not written in the description
[1:43:24] you know some denominations they
[1:43:27] sprinkle water in the foreign
[1:44:23] foreign
[1:44:33] in the message the church and its
[1:44:35] conditions
[1:44:39] that's what's the matter with people
[1:44:42] don't receive the Holy Ghost when they
[1:44:47] are baptized
[1:44:48] they just don't thoroughly repent
[1:44:52] God is trying to give them the Holy
[1:44:55] Ghost
[1:44:56] he wants you to be meek and gentlemen
[1:45:01] quiet
[1:45:03] that's the reason you get up with that
[1:45:06] same selfishness
[1:45:18] that would not make you have the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost
[1:45:23] you've got to get up from there
[1:45:27] a different person
[1:45:29] you've got to get up from there quiet
[1:46:00] it's not difficult
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:41] foreign so it is us to receive
[1:46:45] he has been given why don't you receive
[1:46:49] then the issue is how do you receive
[1:46:52] homophones
[1:46:57] now in the message the Feast of the
[1:46:59] trumpets
[1:47:03] also that the church
[1:47:07] has bound the whole
[1:47:10] Maybe
[1:47:17] you see the Holy Ghost was raised on the
[1:47:19] day of Pentacles
[1:47:21] but he says the church the
[1:47:26] denominational system the religious
[1:47:29] system have bound the Holy Ghost for two
[1:47:33] thousand years
[1:47:43] back there and under the church ages
[1:47:58] but at the though of Creeds and doggyers
[1:48:07] that the Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] cannot work in the church
[1:48:13] because of man-made systems
[1:48:17] but she is going to be liberated
[1:48:21] she is
[1:48:23] coming back
[1:48:27] that's what the Bible says
[1:48:32] the religious system
[1:48:35] they bound the Holocaust
[1:48:38] by their Creeds
[1:48:42] by their unbelief there's something with
[1:48:46] us we can also bind the holies
[1:48:50] by our unbelief by our doubt
[1:48:55] I don't think it is mine I don't think I
[1:48:59] can make it here
[1:49:00] by the things that we get ourselves
[1:49:07] so that you don't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:49:10] so now okay but now when you get the
[1:49:13] true word of God
[1:49:16] the true word of God
[1:49:18] liberates
[1:49:22] because you put away those things that
[1:49:25] are contrary to them foreign
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:06] to have Liberty
[1:50:09] to come down in our songs
[1:50:13] so let us not bind the Holy Spirit by
[1:50:17] our unbelief let us not bind the horse
[1:50:20] by the things that we hear that have
[1:50:23] contrary today
[1:50:36] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[1:50:39] message what is the Holy Ghost
[1:50:42] what is the Holy Spirit
[1:50:45] what is it and now the reason I have
[1:50:48] taken this subject
[1:50:51] in line like this
[1:50:55] you cannot come to his and receive the
[1:50:59] Holy Spirit
[1:51:00] unless you know what it is
[1:51:05] and you cannot receive foreign
[1:51:11] and you cannot receive it if you know
[1:51:14] what unless you believe it is given to
[1:51:17] you
[1:51:19] and it is for you it doesn't work then
[1:51:23] you cannot know whether you've got it or
[1:51:25] not
[1:51:27] unless you know what results it brings
[1:51:32] so if you know what it is and who it is
[1:51:37] and what action it brings
[1:51:40] when it comes then you will know right
[1:51:44] now what you've got when you get it
[1:51:48] that just would say to it so then he
[1:51:53] says you need to know what is
[1:51:58] foreign
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:37] Christ himself living in you are working
[1:52:41] in you transforming into our future so
[1:52:44] what do you do Lord I Surrender
[1:52:49] just to surrender to him
[1:52:51] Lord I give you all my life I give you
[1:52:55] all my mind I give you all my desires
[1:52:59] sure
[1:53:03] deliver me from this you must have a
[1:53:07] desire
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:54:05] you know Christian Life foreign
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:55:36] allow an exchange
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:49] let it be a testimony
[1:55:52] foreign
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:21] foreign
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:56] foreign
[1:57:07] we are learning from him
[1:57:10] and then he says when you come to him
[1:57:13] you learn from him you take upon you
[1:57:17] where Tika he's your question praise the
[1:57:21] name of it what is the Yoke of God
[1:57:25] praise the name of Allah what is the
[1:57:28] York you know a York they put it on the
[1:57:31] shoulder
[1:58:26] foreign
[1:58:29] rest unto your soul
[1:58:32] and then he tells us for my Yorkies
[1:58:38] and my burden
[1:58:42] is light
[1:58:45] so it is easy Chango why do you carry
[1:58:49] your heavy burdens
[1:58:50] when there is a light bar in here
[1:58:55] because it is him who comes in your life
[1:58:59] when you become part of the Testament
[1:59:02] the New Testament it is Christ his own
[1:59:06] life
[1:59:07] it's no longer your life
[1:59:09] it is the life of Jesus himself
[1:59:13] that governs you
[1:59:16] that takes a hold of your life
[1:59:19] praise the name of Allah like a person
[1:59:22] it's no longer I that living
[1:59:25] but it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:31] and so we need to allow God
[1:59:35] to take over our lives
[1:59:38] and to rule over our lives
[1:59:41] to take over our lives
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:17] by this we know that we love the
[2:00:20] children of God and when we love God and
[2:00:22] keep his Commandments
[2:00:31] for this is the love of God that we keep
[2:00:35] his Commandments and these Commandments
[2:00:38] are not Grievous
[2:00:50] he says his Commandments
[2:00:54] Matthew chapter 11.
[2:00:57] and then verse 29.
[2:01:03] my burden is
[2:01:09] not a difficult thing
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] and let the word of God
[2:01:17] be fully in you that it will instruct
[2:01:21] you in your decision making
[2:01:24] instruction every thought that you go
[2:01:27] through
[2:01:31] like a normal person
[2:01:34] a normal person
[2:01:37] when you go to bed you wake up that's
[2:01:41] normal
[2:01:43] there is a principle in the natural life
[2:01:46] but when I sleep I wake up and as I move
[2:01:50] around today I feel hungry and when I
[2:01:54] feel hungry
[2:02:50] it's a different life
[2:03:53] part of you foreign
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:45] he says if any person loves me
[2:04:51] if a man love me he will keep my words
[2:04:56] where is your love for God
[2:04:59] your love for God is expressed in
[2:05:03] obedience to the word of God
[2:05:06] so you cannot say Lord I love you and
[2:05:10] then you don't obey himself so he says
[2:05:13] if any man love me he will keep my words
[2:05:16] and my father will love him
[2:05:20] so when you hear the word
[2:05:23] when you hear the word of the Testaments
[2:05:29] and that word of The Testament then the
[2:05:32] blood of the sacrifice
[2:05:34] the life from the blood of Jesus
[2:05:39] will come down in your heart this is
[2:05:43] what he's saying here if any man loves
[2:05:46] me he will keep my words and my father
[2:05:50] will love him
[2:06:50] you know so
[2:06:54] let me get good animals and then give
[2:06:59] sacrifices
[2:07:01] but that was not the thing and then the
[2:07:05] prophet told him let us go and pick that
[2:07:08] scripture
[2:07:10] praise the name of our Lord in the book
[2:07:12] of First Samuel
[2:07:14] chapter 15.
[2:07:18] praise the name of our Lord
[2:07:25] verse 20.
[2:07:31] and so say that somewhere yeah I have
[2:07:34] obeyed the voice of the Lord and I've
[2:07:37] gone the way the law which the Lord sent
[2:07:40] to me and have brought the king of
[2:07:43] amalek and of utterly destroyed the
[2:07:45] amalekites
[2:08:01] of America
[2:08:03] but the people took of the spoil the
[2:08:07] sheep and The Oxen the chief of the
[2:08:09] things which should have been utter
[2:08:12] destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[2:08:15] God in gilgar about
[2:08:31] and Samuel said has the Lord has great
[2:08:34] Delight in burnt offerings and
[2:08:36] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[2:08:39] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[2:08:42] sacrifice and to hacking than the fight
[2:08:45] of rams same way
[2:09:07] you know some people they think
[2:09:11] sacrifices
[2:09:12] are above obedience
[2:09:17] the word of God
[2:09:19] and so you find people have different
[2:09:22] programs now
[2:09:28] the word of God tells us to pray
[2:09:32] very good the word of God tells us to
[2:09:36] fast
[2:09:38] very good the words the word of God
[2:09:41] tells us to to give
[2:09:45] it and all the different things which
[2:09:49] you can do as a sacrifice
[2:09:52] which you can do as a Living Sacrifice
[2:09:57] but none of those things
[2:10:58] and then he's saying I'm bringing to
[2:11:00] sacrifice to the Lord
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:04] but then he was told to destroy
[2:11:06] everything
[2:11:08] then why wouldn't you destroy everything
[2:11:12] and then you give offerings after you've
[2:11:16] destroyed everything
[2:11:19] so then you get people they think that
[2:11:22] God can change his mind over his words
[2:11:28] this is what I think I'm not going to
[2:11:31] pray about it what are you going to who
[2:11:33] are you going to pray too
[2:12:29] until the sun goes down
[2:12:32] supposing Jesus comes in the evening
[2:12:35] foreign
[2:12:40] praise the name of our Lord so we need
[2:12:42] to be obedient more than sacrifices
[2:12:46] and this is what Samuel was telling so
[2:12:51] praise the name of it so God Delights
[2:12:57] when our hearts are obedient unto him
[2:13:02] praise the name of Allah broken heart
[2:13:06] contrite spirit
[2:13:08] let us go to Psalms 34 18.
[2:13:12] as I try to wind up
[2:13:17] foreign
[2:13:21] and then verse 18.
[2:13:26] so the scripture says
[2:13:34] whether Psalm is 34 18 sorry
[2:13:38] he says the Lord is nigh unto them that
[2:13:42] are of a broken heart and serve such as
[2:13:45] be of a contrite spirit
[2:13:50] um
[2:13:55] you want God to be near you you want to
[2:13:59] be the dwelling place of God
[2:14:02] God is near
[2:14:05] those of a broken heart
[2:14:09] experience
[2:14:11] see that you have that
[2:14:13] you are genuine
[2:14:16] you are sincere the most simple praise
[2:14:18] the name of Allah you know Lord this is
[2:14:21] my mistake
[2:14:23] this is the thing I've done which is
[2:14:25] wrong
[2:14:28] have a broken heart have a contrite
[2:14:32] spirit
[2:14:33] and let this be part of you daily
[2:14:37] not the ones
[2:14:39] praise the name of Allah always seek
[2:14:43] forgiveness
[2:14:44] when you do something wrong
[2:14:49] repenting to one another forgiving one
[2:14:52] another not having a Stony heart I will
[2:14:56] not forgive that one I will not repent
[2:14:59] to that that is the Stony house but we
[2:15:03] need to have you know a broken heart
[2:15:06] experience
[2:15:11] Lord sure this is my mistake Lord is my
[2:15:15] friend foreign
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:16:00] and the none of the other three grounds
[2:16:04] that could be foreign
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:17:00] being under the same conditions in this
[2:17:02] world
[2:17:03] we are living under the same Temptations
[2:17:07] we are living under the same trials
[2:17:10] there's some challenges
[2:17:13] if there is it for school fees
[2:17:18] but why does it come for you
[2:17:23] in the times of Trials
[2:17:25] what kind of heart do you have what kind
[2:17:29] of ground do you have
[2:17:30] praise the name of Allah so what you
[2:17:33] need break the stones
[2:17:36] remove your Stony house
[2:17:41] when the wine drops there it will be
[2:17:44] able to grow even in the midst of all
[2:17:46] challenges
[2:17:49] the word will sink it will continue the
[2:17:54] roots will go deeper
[2:18:00] foreign
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:54] it also makes mistakes
[2:18:57] it also fails in one way or another one
[2:19:01] but this heart when it makes mistakes
[2:19:06] when it sins it is the honest
[2:19:10] that it is broken down and says Lord
[2:19:14] have mercy upwards
