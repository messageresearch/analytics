be so many things to be done bring us in the house of God father since you've us to come in your house Lord speak to us Lord take us and come and speak to your children let your spirit guide and lead us Lord question I was blessed when I was in the father we commit each one of us in your hands even the reading of the word father may you anoint it and bless it to our hearts Lord our pastors are before us others are in the missionaries bless abundantly protect their also Min so we service in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's open the word the book of Philippians verse one if consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any comfort of love if and fellowship of the spirit if any powers and mercies feel ye my joy that you may be like minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife no Vine GR but in less of Mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man to his own things and ver verse four look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not Rob to be equal with God but made himself of no repetition and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in likeness of men for for may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word just be seated uh I want to thank God the opportunity the P to stand before the purch of the blood as I've is challenging and hard stand the of because they know the know message so it's really challenging to where start but I also request you to pray for me and may the Lord speak amen so here Paul says that Christ being in the form of God he never it he never kind of auor of in other words the position he was given he took it that way praise the Lord he never thought to be above all the powers that he had praise the Lord so him being in the form of man he served in that praise the Lord where need spitting on him he never came up as God and cast them the Lord sometimes they struck him when he was carrying the cross yes but him being he didn't come up and say I am good why are they doing this to me praise the Lord so today by the grace of God us to share on the unve praise the Lord that word uning unveiling praise the Lord that word unveiling it means to remove something that has been protected praise the Lord to remove what was shielding praise the Lord that is what that word means un praise the Lord so the unveiling of God praise the Lord here we notice that Paul say that here Christ him in the form of man he never thought it he never thought it robber to be equal with God so in other words even us now we have the spirit of Christ praise the Lord even when we have the spirit of Christ Christ doesn't expect us chist to go above with that spirit because that power of Christ do praise the Lord it can do anything praise the Lord if Christ in us he expects us to do what his will is praise the Lord expects us to do what his will is praise the Lord that's why the prophet says Believers we are not meant to ask God for power because the power is already in the church the power is already in us but what we is the faith what we La is the faith to unlock it are we clear you know we have the power Christ is in us we have the power but faith is what unlocks that power inise the Lord not because you know some people somebody can say it is going to rain tomorrow that's the power of God like that praise the Lord some people can speak things and you get them on way but Christ doesn't want us to act his power in that form he wants us to use his only according to his word the Lord now one time even the power of Christ helps us to know how to ask from God helps us to even know how we can you know how we can even like let me give you an example there was a time a woman was you know she wanted to be healed of Christ what did she praise the Lord woman said son Jesus could reason she was a gentile praise the lordes callr son of they don't call Christ praise the Lord but then there was another one this was a Jew when he cried son of davus praise the Lord the power that had know how toise the Lord it helped him know how he can call and claim on Christ praise the Lord because he was a Jew praise the Lord you have to know which words to use when you are before Christ even sister the best words to use in order for that power to come praise the Lord when you notice brother told told her poor you can ask for dollars the Lord just imagine you are before the prophet and the prophet of God and his first statement is you are poor ask for money what praise the Lord praise the Lord he says you have your sister sick you have this one is disorganized you have this like this praise the Lord sister the best words to use why Christ had unveiled to her praise the Lord Christ unveiled to her on what ask the Lord and now some of us you know God has given us the Worden and this word what God expects us to use while asking him don't use your words Jesus when he was teaching us to pray he never wanted us to like theise the Lord Repeat After Hours only one and the prophet tells us if God is our father then we don't need to shout for demons why do you shout for theil if God is your father and for him demons run from him look at Jesus he never I never read somewhere I never read somewhere that Jesus shouted for the demon to live somewhere heed fingers others they were crying before he had spoken anything so God has given us the word on how we can ask him praise the Lord and this word is already unveiled praise the Lord the word is already [Music] uniled because we're back let's go to Second let's go to Corinthians praise the Lord second Corinthians in verse let's start from verse let's start from verse four four the Bible say 2 Corinthians 3:4 it says and such trust have we through Christ to God one not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficient praise the Lord who has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the later but of the spirit for the later kill but the spirit give life but if the ministration of death written and Engen in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly hold the face of Moses and the glory of the continents which Glory was to be done let's go to verse 12 immediately seeing then that we have such hope we use Great Plain PL of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfast look to the end of that which then verse 14 but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading in the reading of the Old Testament which ve is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken awaya the Lord them days you know in the days of Moses that glory god never wanted anybody to share that Glory praise the Lord that's why when Moses was going on the mountain forid even animal to go on that praise the Lord God even forbade men to go with Moses he wanted Moses alone why he wanted to retain That Glory of himself praise the Lord in veil of Moses that day in the veil of Moses praise the Lord when he hides Here Comes Moses and when he came before the people his face was sh shining the first was shining and had to cover if that shadow Glory was very glorious the Lord because then was still there praise the Lord the was still there but here when it comes to the Lord Paul says the ve shall be taken away praise the Lord and what happens when the veil is taken away what is it we have Fellowship straight away we have Fellowship straight away with the Lord himself because the ve is no longer there praise the Lord and what happens in their days they had the holy of holies it was failed and then one was the only one to get there praise the Lord and what happened what was behind that Veil it was the Ark of the Covenant it was the word of God which was veiled in there praise the Lord now that's why the prophet says that ve which was protecting the word of God when it comes to Christ it comes to the Lord he takes it away then whats it's the word of God praise the lord we have fellowship with the word PL view in Us Praise the Lord if the word is PL with us then why don't we know how to praise the Lord until the prophet says don't wait to be in trouble that you can pray if you have always because when trial comes sometimes you may not have time to when those circumstance comes us sometimes may not have time to pray praise the Lord now accident finds way how are you going to when the legs are up praise the Lord if you are normal that's the best time to pray that's the best time to pray praise the Lord our young our young sisters us now when wants us now don't wait to be used up with the devil praise the Lord don't wait to be done when come to the house of God wants to use us now when your life is clean that can stand and say there is a Joseph's wife can't defile him because God is confident in Joseph praise the Lord even us now God wants to use Us Praise the Lord God wants to use us but you see some of young people like I've said the is done away and the word is in view now praise the Lord just imagine in 5 years back we didn't have Fellowship like we have now yes praise the lord we used to end on overnight Services Sunday Services Sunday Services radio programs which some didn't even listen but now God has brought us again on WhatsApp and we are there with fellow why don'tk the word is plain in view that we have no any I mean we have no anything like we don't have it praise the Lord the word go behind there books are like this some are even roting praise the Lord praise the Lord so we have the word in PL View and then God expects us come and fellowship around the word praise the Lord God expects young people and every believer that when his word is before him he us to be cleansed praise the Lord expects us to be cleansed praise the Lord God is already unveiled praise the Lord God is already unveil amen so what happens now in their days they used not to understand the unveiling of God when come some of them speak against him praise the Lord some of them could not recognize he's the one why he was hidden praise the Lord one timeing got sicking got sick then on his he went to cons the gods of Praise the Lord and then what happens God sent Elijah go and meet those vants ask them is there no God in Israel but where was God praise the Lord where was God Elijah praise the Lord God was in Elijah veiled in and expected men to go and consult from the Lord that's what done praise the Lord even people who used secret and to go and do things without his consent without him being aware was watching praise the Lord even to us Believers God is always conscious of us if his word is in always asking himself why are my people blinded praise the Lord why are my people not seeing yet this thing is play praise the Lord already the prophet says to us the ve is taken away meaning we have no EXC about the word of God praise the lord we have exes because this word has come to perfect us and to lead us home praise the Lord no one knows the way but the word is the way praise the Lord no one knows when the rupture will come the word contains it praise the Lord what we have to do come in plain Fellowship with that word praise the Lord come in The View with that word praise the Lord because if we believe the message really C our hearts why don't you post them on stus praise the Lord some of us have many followers some of us have people who see our statuses why don't you the word which you believe but you know the Devil Makes Us the prophet says a statement which makes me timid that we worship the devil when we don't know how do we do what are youting on your WhatsApp praise the Lord of it is very hard to explain the life behind it some of them are videos that have long some minutes long and then you wonder this believer who has put this why didn't youst the church praise the Lord but then may the Lord bless so what I feel when the word is in let us be confident the Lord because the Bible says the word of God is powerful you may not speak to somebody that is converted but that word poed there touch people's s praise the Lord because we are hunting for the last one and all the sources all the sources they have God social Tik Tok WhatsApp Facebook on radio programs post things there if you have access to tell God I'm in your words praise the Lord praise the Lord now when that word is in plain view God expects us to be transformed with the same worda the Lord praise the Lord because what I say God in those days he hid those servants the holy men and most of the people acted the Life of Christ when they don't know praise the Lord and then here Christ comes when he came he was fulfilling what they had spoken what they had lived but their children were not taught until when Christ came they were not sober to search back how did Joseph live his life praise the Lord how did David live his life compared to Christ his life compared to Christ when Christ says spoke of me these people to look back to Moses and then they refer to him here praise the Lord even us the prophet has spoken a lot of things he has spoken many many many promises until some of them we see them praise the Lord some of them we see them but how do we take conscious of them praise the Lord don't wait to hear when someone has seen a dead person like maybe somebody has Ren and seen and then you start to panic to come to church Lord know praise the Lord what is to do get ready now because the word is already in plain view so you get ready now so that even though you hear somebody so resurrected prise the Lord never told us the prophet never told us when you see one arise you conting Church praise the Lord he said the will even find you at work find you anywhere praise the Lord some will be sleeping so how are you going to get in sise the Lord the time is now when the word is open when the word is unveiled this is the time praise the Lord and you know when God shows his word he has always wanted people to come around his word praise the Lord he has always wanted men come around his word amen amen but sometimes circumstances push us far from this word praise the Lord until this is real and the prophet spoke it and said Satan has set schools but schools are good butan them to make us off the word teach us off the word praise the Lord that's why when you go to schools some religious religion somewhere there and then when they they teach you who is the mother of Jesus they will receive you that is Mary that deception they will teach you the father of Jesus is should you put anything besides you Beed praise the Lord but the truth is the Bible teaches us Jesus having no father no mother but when you give them that answer they not Mark with you praise the Lord schools are set the word praise the Lord praise the Lord I heard it past preached Itor Robert most of the young people once we get the degrees we get we even nect our parents they can't say anything Nows when mother tells why are you going out now may not right praise the Lord then what is that before God the Lord he has set hospitals praise the Lord and these hospitals they have driven us from their unveiled praise the lord we don't have faith in the word of God and yet is before us what could it it's the word Fai in that word praise the Lord praise the Lord so God has always wanted his children to be much different praise the Lord he has always wanted his children to be different from the world that's why the word is in view to give us a standard The Life of Christ praise the Lord that when he comes when Christ comes then we are like him because this word is here praise the Lord in the last days in the last days God has rent the praise the Lord he hasent it and brought the word for this AG write in plain view praise the Lord in these last days rent the and this is real praise the Lord this is real the word is in plain view but the prophet says that word it is in Praise the Lord why is it inil because of the traditions of our hearts praise the Lord but yet God has made it in Praise the Lord but the traditions of Our Lives makes the word again fail when the word is performed people don't see it praise Lord when the word is being made manifest praise the Lord what happens God requests and likes us to be attentive whenever his word is praise the Lord because what is very hard is like the prophet says the hardest thing God has ever done hard thing is when the that's the hardest but yet God uses these people praise the Lord God uses them the people in the times of brother Bram they used to call himana but this was a man was speaking from God he was speaking direct from God praise the Lord meaning if we were to reject if we were to reject this man meaning we have rejected God directly praise the Lord therefore when the word is in plain view God wants us and expects us to be very atten praise the Lord because these days it is the manifestation of the word of God these are the days of the manifestation of the word of God the Lord these are the days we don't need to move with volumes of the Bible on the streets praise the Lord don't need to move with those Bibles we don't need to move with the volumes of messages praise the Lord be yourself the message praise the Lord because it is in VI and the prophet says most of us who wants to listen to other things the prophet says even when I've I've gone away refer to this praise the Lord even when I've gone away refer to this praise the Lord that's what the prophet says that even when he has gone away he expects us to listen to his word this is the message now care all the message care all the message and when you listen to this St when you listen to that even maybe I will be gone someday when the Lord is done when the Lord is finished with me you would refer back to this listen to my voice what I'm telling you me before he coming remember I have spoken to you in the name of the Lord by the word of the Lord praise the Lord the prophet says even when I've gone away you listen to to my voice to this because it is the word of God in VI praise the Lord if you've not gotten it still God has not left you alone he has brought us the Min here just call Pastor read this message I'm not getting it what's behind it maybe the V is on your face may use your P praise the lord we have a lot of people around us so even though you refer and you've not understood it what do you do God has agents praise the Lord why God the holy spirit this is a message I'm quoting God the Holy Spirit fell upon men praise the Lord the Holy Spirit fell upon men men and man I want to see this you know even when you read the message not understood it God has agents praise the Lord the holy spirit this is the message the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is I want to say that praise the Lord come on the Holy Spirit fell upon men in the message God in his people praise the Lord so he says the Holy Spirit upon praise the Lord yeah that message the Holy Spirit fell upon men is God his agent and the hardest thing that God has ever the hardest thing that God has ever had do as to do was to get one another oneise the Lord is agents and the Holy Spirit has fallen upon them to guide us along the way praise the Lord until the song writer says I'm using my Bible for the road map and the 12 disciples are the signs praise the Lord so if you don't follow the signs where are you going is pointing this because you see the going praise the Lord so God wants us when he has brought his word he wants us to believe him the Lord praise the Lord because somebody who doesn't believe the word of God what does it do you displease the Lord praise the Lord and where the word of God is Not can't stay there praise the Lord he has always dwelt where his word is so when the word of God isain in our view isn't that praise the lord we have God Among Us Praise the Lord when God is in PL view why don't we ask praise the Lord because what was hidden that ve in the Old Testament word of God and that word before us now it is in Praise the Lord it is in and then the power of the Holy Spirit Glory that comes upon the believer I mean the real Believers causes the work of God and the faith of the word of God God in us praise the Lord to believe the word that's hid in the eyes of other people praise the Lord so to us when we believe the word of God when we dwell all the time with the word of God the glory of God has always been with us praise the Lord until one time pastor preached how I wish I wish you knew the gift of praise the Lord God has blessed us and His blessings they are open praise the Lord God His blessings are open but what hinders us to access them un praise the Lord but his word is already in so what we need to do let us act the word praise the Lord as I finish spirit this this is a message now if the spirit of God is really in us then we should always look at Christ as our example praise the Lord because one time okay let me read this message then I tell this as I finish brother Bram says now if I told you I was John the spirit of was on me praise the Lord have been on me and then he says you would look for me to have guns because that man had guns or act like then he says if I told you I was anti you know okay the spirit of of a great artist was on me you would expect me to paint pictures of an artist then he says again if I told you I was exp mechan and the mechanic was on me expect me to know what was wrong with your car if I tell you that I was born of the spirit of God the of Christ then he says was on me okay the spirit of Christ was on me you would expect me to do what he did act like he did that is his Spirit working through human beings praise the Lord so meaning when we have the spirit of Christ this Spirit of Christ must always drive us to look Christ praise the Lord this was in my primary I used have a friend of mine and this person loved this player you know Ronaldo and the truth is anything you see thiser [Music] did I was seeing it on this young man and I wondered how did you startling the ball like this he told me I I put all my time to watch his Styles praise the Lord I follow him up daily when there is a I follow him get sick now look at such if then we had the same Spirit on Christ that we want to be like him we would search his word which is in and once we search dently that word through that word of Christ then we shall act like him directly praise the lord we not act like him because all the time I'll be searching which style is going to use to today no if I am a believer now if I want to know which style Christ will Tove meise the Lord if I want Christ to bless me today I go in the word and see how he can do it and that way you not going to miss the blessings of God because the blessings always come praise the Lord like my young people God loves you so much he wants to destroy your life but if Rebecca didn't come to fet water would miss praise the Lord maybe she was disobedient not to do work at home you can get some water Mom I'm tired I'm doing studies you miss the bless so when God wants to bless us he wants us to be always present praise the Lord because his blessings are always plain praise the Lord and P preached one time and said the blessings of God they don't follow come with pain no praise the Lord blessings they come by believing his word praise the Lord because the prophet says revealed word in the pl view word in it it contains the blessings of God it contains the healing of God it it contains all that God is praise the Lord praise the Lord may the Lord bless [Applause] you allow me invite the pastor invite the pastor you're welcome prise the Lord amen [Applause] praise the Lord do you believe you in the unveiling of [Applause] God amen amen you see the unveiling was it's the unveiling God himself unveiling himself but today unveils himself in his own bride that right life you live is not your life it's God uning himself the seed on the inside there begins to be fruitful and all the fruit all the victories is the unveiling of God so we thank God for living in the days of the Fulfillment of the word and may the Lord bless our brother Dan you see that's a very good beginning when you see young men come up something to say you justk God for them yeah so let's just stand up and have a word of prayer and we close the service have you been blessed
