We love you and we thank you Lord and we pray may be with us this day Lord for the glory of your holy name in the name of Jesus this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Say good morning to be here. We thank God who has given us the grace to be here. Praise the name of our Lord. There's a brother called Okapas. You can stand up. You're welcome. Our brother to have you around. You may sit down. He prays with the church in Brother Jackson's church. So, we're happy to have you around. Then other visitors coming here for the first time, you can raise up your hands. You're welcome, my brother. We're happy to have you around. Praise the name of our Lord. So there is a testimony here from our sister Jenna if you can stand up sister Jenn. Thank you. So she testifies. God bless you saints. I want to appreciate our precious pastors James and for their love together. with all the brothers and sisters who managed to travel to Mumbali and all of you supported me financially during the time I lost my father. I also appreciate my husband for the contribution he made right from the time of the father's sickness. May God bless you abundantly. This is from our sister Jenna. &gt;&gt; Amen. So likewise our sister called Pauline. She's the wife of pastor Elijah of the father passed on on Friday and the barrier is there today this afternoon. It's a place called that's after some of us will be traveling immediately after this first service. My wife has been with Sister Paul since yesterday. That's why she's not around. Praise the name of the Lord. But today afternoon we are going to still continue with our youth service and I requested brother Wilson to help handle that. Praise the name of our Lord. Then on Friday we have an overnight service. So you are all welcome for the overnight. Friday will be 25th. So you are welcome. Want to appreciate those who came yesterday for the praying and fasting meeting. And I would just encourage you to always come for the services when the church is open. Then on Sunday we shall have only one service. But on Friday again there is a brother called Benjamin. &gt;&gt; He's the son of brother Salam from he'll be having his introduction in on Friday. Then on Saturday, that will be next Saturday 26th, he'll be having his wedding in church in Kala. And I believe we are invited to attend that wedding. I would also urge you to make your support to the family of brother. Praise the name of our Lord. Then next month, it will be on 24th of August we are going to be hosting here brother Tim do. Praise the name of our Lord for meetings here, two services. It will be a Sunday 24th of August and I would still urge you for your support for those services. And we just keep on praying for all these meetings. Praise the name of our Lord. So I want to invite the youth to come and sing as our pastor comes. Are you happy to have our pastor back? Amen. Amen. Okay. Maybe before they come, I'm sorry I' forgotten another crucial program which made me come and stand here. I believe brother was wondering what's happening to my request. Before they come, let us sing a song. Bring them in as brother comes with his three children. Brother, if you can come for bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the wondering ones to Jesus. Oh, bring them bring. Halleluah. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sea. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring thou wondering ones to Jesus. [Music] Brother does come with his children that they can be dedicated into the hands of the Lord and we want to appreciate you. Let us clap for him. The mother of the children has not been able to come. She had a aunt who was sick. &gt;&gt; So that's why she went to attend since Thursday. Now children were never baptized, but they brought the children into the hands to the Lord in Mark chapter 19. And then verse 13, the Bible says, "Then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, "Suffer little children and forbide them not to not forbide them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of God." And he laid his hands on them and departed. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Lord blessed the children. He never baptized them. And then he tells us, "Unless we are converted like little children, we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven in Mark 18 and then verse one to verse 4. So he says, "At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? [Music] And Jesus called a little child unto them, and set him in the midst of them, and saying, Verily, I say unto you, except you be converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. [Music] And whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name receiveth me. [Music] And let us pray for them. Okay, let us pray for chaos. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate this little child into your hands. As the father has brought them into your presence, we pray that your blessings comes upon her life. Father, may you watch over in the name of Jesus Christ. It has told us that forbide not little children to come unto me. So we commit her life into your hands that Lord may watch over her all the days of her life. protect us from all evil plans of Satan, all negative influences, from all powers of darkness and all diseases. And may you give the grace to the father and the mother to raise this child in the fear of the Lord that they may be an a good example unto her father. May you also provide for all her physical and spiritual needs. that Lord you may help her father. She may always be influenced by the word of God that when she grows up heavenly father may she be your handmade lord now that lord she may serve in the kingdom of god. Bless our father and all things ordained in her life. May they come for the glory of your holy name in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chariot. Let us pray for chariot. Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ dedicate chariot into your hands. praying your blessings comes upon his life. May you watch over his life, father. May he be raised in the fear of the Lord and at the time Lord of accountability. May he come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and come father to confess you as his personal savior. I pray that father all his life father may be of great use to the kingdom of God. Watch over his life father. provide for all that he has need of God. May you honestly watch over his life and guide him in the name of Jesus. Protect him from all negative influences that he may be such a blessing to his family and such a blessing to the kingdom of God. We pray your protection be upon his life and open door heavenly father for all the path that he has to go through for the glory of your holy name Lord in the name of Jesus Christ do pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bonita we pray for her. Father in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this little girl into your hands that's being dedicated. Father into your hearts, Father. May you watch over her life, Lord.

We pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you may take away any form of evil or danger negative influences God that your mercies and goodness may always be upon her and Lord Jesus Christ that you may use her in the name of Jesus Christ to build your house father in the name of Jesus Christ to pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you so much. Amen. The can come [Music] [Music] down from his glory. [Music] ever living story. My God and Savior came and Jesus was his name. Born in a manger to his own a strangeanger. I'm man of sorrow tears and I go in. Oh, how I love, how I adore him.

My holy dark to become my savior. and all God's fullness dwelling in him and all God's fullness reth in him. [Music] How I future my in [Music] creator [Music] became my savior and no cost too. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. And all God's children, &gt;&gt; they dwell in him because every one of us contribute to that fullness here and the gene here and here all dwell in him and we make the fullness of the godhead. So I want to greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. It's a privilege beyond any possible measure for us to be called sons and daughters of God. Sometimes we take it lightly. that if you really came to think that God bypassing all the creation around you, passing all the nice boys in the area, nice girls and he on you and he says you are my son to me that's a very great thing. Amen. Amen. By grace are we fellow hairers with God's own son. In all eternal inheritance, we share the same life with his son. We share in the authority of the name. He has reserved for us a body. Amen. That's going to be exactly the same quality with this body. Because when he comes, we shall be like him. He has identified himself together with us. And Paul calls him the firstborn of many brethren. And John says, "As he is, so are we." Amen. Sometimes we don't look at that as strongly as we should. We want to know that we are a class above the ordinary and that we need to esteem one another. Amen. Paul said, "Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves." Amen. It's very important that we esteem one another. When you look at this brethren, Amen. Don't put him below yourself. You know, I like Jonathan in the Bible. The son of Saul, you know, he discovered the importance of esteeming one another above. The virtue of being a son to King Saul, Amen. he was going to be the next king. But when he saw the attributes in the life of David, he preferred David to become the next king. That is preferring one another above self. So we really thank God for each other. Amen. Amen. Let's just turn around and shake one another's hands. Welcome one another to the house of the Lord. Just learn to relax that the Lord may speak to you this morning. The purpose why we come to the house of the Lord is that we may have fellowship with him. And the fellowship we have, one must develop fellowship with God in order for him to have fellowship with the other brother. So, are you in fellowship with Christ? The last time we were here, we talked about going through the waters of purification. Amen. The waters of separation. And from the waters of separation, we come into fellowship with Christ. And if every one of us has gone through those waters, that's the only way they could come together. When before God, they were perfect. So we thank God for our pastor and it's important that we give him the right hand of fellowship. Amen. Amen. And I want to advise you with such a ministry Amen. You don't stay away when the church doors are open. Amen. I have a belief and I honestly believe it that brother James has the ability to take this church to another level high. But you need him. I mean he needs you. &gt;&gt; Amen. to pray for him, support him in every way possible and the only way you can encourage his ministry to practically be part of it. Amen. Amen. Never miss any services. Amen. Amen. So I want to welcome you this morning into the presence of the Lord. Let us stand up as we go into the scripture reading. Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 19. We talked to the author before we get there to read it. Precious heavenly father, we want to give thanks to you for the opportunity you have given to us to come into the house of of correction. When you say house of correction, father we are here before you just as open can be that you may check on the inside. Encourage us where you have to Lord. Rebuke where you have to father. You are father and we are children. We don't come to you simply because we are perfect. We come to you heavenly father in imperfection that you may make us perfect. That's the only we can get into the presence when you yourself makes it possible. I pray heavenly father every need that your children have. I pray that in the preaching of the word you may reach every area that your children desires of their hearts in Jesus can be knocked down in the Holy of Holies. back. Our God is not happy when you step back. Amen. We are not of those who step back. We are of those that fight all the way to the end of this world. And at the end, sister Mary, &gt;&gt; we shall say we have fought a good fight. Amen. God is there with you when they are trying to to touch that cancer out of your life. Amen. You are fighting a good fight. If there is a very serious situation in your family and you say, "I will not draw back. fighting a good fight. Are you together with me? If the devil is trying to pin it on you, you say, "I'll fight on. I'm going to fight a good fight. I'm not going to be of those who fall back in the Amen." Revelation 13 and verse 4, the scripture says, "And they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast. And they watch the beast saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him? In the end time, the beast will kind of become so powerful." Amen. In different uh sectors of of life. Amen. It will be the power behind politics. It will be the power behind religion. It will be the power be behind the economy. And even in the end times, he'll be given power against the saints. So those who don't see by the word, they will say, who is able to make war against the beast? Amen. Amen. Because he has been given power. He has been allowed. In the end time, God allows us to be tested. And as we get into this test, it's only those that are in the Lamb's book of life that will have the boldiness to worship God. The rest of them, the scripture says if their names were not written on the lamb's book of life, then they are going to worship the beast. Amen. So God allows certain things. He allows disappointments. He allows complaints in the church. He allows misunderstanding. He allows bad forces and all that is supposed to drop those that were not written in the lamb's book of life. This morning say I thank God I'm part of the blam's book of life. There is no circumstance that can kick the elect out of of worship. The boldness. Amen. That the elect has to step into the presence of God for worship. In the good times, in the bad times, they are right in there. whether they have the worst goods or they don't have the worst goods inside their worshiping. Amen. Whether disappointed in my marriage, I'm not stopping my worship because the boldness because I'm not entering in there depending on my work. Amen. The Lord went ahead of me. and sprinkled the with the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies. And Paul was given unto him to continue for two months. Now this happens here in the tribulation. But we understand that with the work of God, working of God, you know, there is no clearcut stop. Amen. That this age stopped here. This age begins to go forward. We understand that the ages overlap. Amen. Now being in the end time, the next thing we are looking for is the rapture of the church. And then comes in the tribulation. But all that the tribulation will be is already here in baby form. Are you together with me? All these things we see are here in baby form. And we need to be careful because these situations are going to become harder as we keep going forward. That's right. Amen. Amen. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blasphe his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given him in all kindreds and tongs and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him because he will not exhibit a lot of power. Amen. But there are those who are not looking at drama in the Pentecostal world. Amen. How fabulous they are becoming. The colorful worship they could exercise, the great music they do. They are those that will keep their eyes. I said they are going to keep their eye on the message of the hour because it's the guide that will walk by. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if they are not in the lamb's book of life, the scripture says, "Amen. All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb from the foundation of the world." The scripture says the book of life of the lamb. We shall break that up a little bit. So in the end time, the antichrist anointing pours out in a very great measure in every sect of life. So this fool's anointing powers out. Amen. &gt;&gt; At the same time when the son of man Amen is being revealed and proceeding all the way through into the tribulation in a greater measure. Are you together with me? So and is given power against the saints. is given power over politics, is given power over trade, is given power over religion. All the leaders of the world, they perform a pilgrimage and they go into wrong when they get power. All of them go. Amen. So because of the exhibition of this authority and the anointing, many whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life, they will worship this beast that had the ability that zipped the anointing that he received from the dragon. And the dragon is the devil. He anoints this beast. Now this perverted worship will easily take on the people that the devil has already deceived into worship. Are you together with me? They are a people that the devil has already deceived into force worship like the worship of idols like the worship of the stars. Amen. I'm not talking about these stars here. I'm talking about the stars. The man who seem to shine. In the sports world, in the music world, in film industry, there are people there that are worshiped. In the time of brother Brham, there was the band called the Beatles. And they said that they were more famous than Jesus. They could go into places And when people would hear that the beles were coming, &gt;&gt; they would do a drive. And when they come into places, even the cripples would get out of their chairs and the blind would open their eyes to see the beles. That's a power from somewhere. They would worship the stars and some of them worship the self success who is like me who is like a king are you together with me they begin to worship the self I cannot cannot be preached to by so and so. I cannot go to church. They wash their success. They wash their money. They worship of great personality. And some of them they worship holy men. Isaiah had been trapped into it in the worship of a great man. was a great king. He prospered Israel and ruled for many years. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was so god-fearing. And in the eyes of Isaiah, he trapped on your father brought him out of there. He preached the message influence. Who is your influence? The worship of men. Even in churches, they are faces that are worshiped. &gt;&gt; If brother so and so says this, that's all. I don't want another person to send me. So those kind of elements, you know, those kind of elements, those are going to be easier to for the enemy in the end time because Isaiah says in the year that King died, I saw also he had seen his gift. He didn't know he was a prophet in calling. He couldn't even see God. Amen. And so now is very easy for those kind of I mean spirits to be taken over in the end because we must be in church because we have seen the law not because we are seeking to worship a holy man. But we have seen the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That should be your testimony. We have seen the Lord. While God can only receive direct worship. Remember, Satan can accept worship. In any form. He can trap you in any form. In the worship of your money, in the worship of your whatever it is, it means more to you than God. That is the worship. So worship means adoration [Music] or devotion to something that unconsciously you regard it more than God even in your subconscious. So sometimes you don't even know what you are doing. &gt;&gt; But that's why you need a gift to come and comb the word and show you the position where you stand. And when you see the position where you stand is the moment you have to say, "Lord, give me grace. I need to come into a perfect worship. Amen. So in the end time the worship will be so specific. This is where we are headed to. You either worship God or you worship the beast because we are in the time where the word is picking out the elect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The elect is being picked out by the word and any other that will not be found in the L's book of life. We certainly have to wash the beast. This is the hour to identify ourselves to tell the devil who you are. I am the son of God. I come from God. There's no devil that can twist my mind. Amen. Brother Brham says demons are working on every hand and God's spirit moving right on the other hand to counteract every time. Amen. Demon is at work every time. And you know brother Brham says that the devil cannot work without a body. He has to be embodied where the devil came. I don't know in a spirit form in this assembly of uh Job in Job's church. He did not materialize much. He was not able to catch Job until God allowed Are you together with me? But when the devil puts on a body and becomes Judas and comes into church with the rest of the saints, he can achieve much. After you have fed on the word, Judas will say, "Look at this. This oil we could have sold and we could help the poor. How many voices are operating on the alternative all the time when the ministry has preached? Then comes this alternative voice. And it's always easier to see the negative than to see the positive. I thank God there is that who were elected from before the foundation of the world. They always have the positive look at the feast. Amen. Because we are heading out now in the time of the great showdown. Brother Brham says coming pretty soon between God and the devil. Amen. That countdown. Amen. Between God and the devil. Somebody say amen somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's true. And this beast that we are talking about will be a man at the top of the religious system in the end time. He will drive the general belief system in the end time. He also control politics and the economy. Now in revelation chapter 13 and verse 18 he says here is wisdom because the scriptures say those who are not written in the lamp's book of life says that they will worship the beast and Now worship &gt;&gt; is adoration. Worship &gt;&gt; is devotion. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now we are here and now there comes some form of adoration. He says here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast. For it's the number of a man. &gt;&gt; So the beast is a man who raises himself above God. And when raised himself above God and he says, "Look at my mighty kingdom." The spirit of an animal entered into Nebuchadnezzar and he went and lived with the beast in the wild. and he began to eat grass like the beast of the wild. Are you together with me? But he was a man and he was king of Babylon. So in the end time in this Babylon system where we are there rises up a beast with the same kind of anointing because it has devolved itself above God. is like the king of Tyrus in Ezekiel chapter 28 who considered himself to be God. So when we are talking about this beast we are talking about a man are you together with me in revelation chapter 17 the Bible says that beast is riding a woman is riding a woman. Amen. And the woman is a church system. So now even in the book of Revelation, he controls the economy. Amen. To the extent the time will come if you don't have a mark in your forehead which means the doctrine which is acceptable to him or the mark in the hand meaning that you give him your hand of fellowship you will not be able to buy or to sell. We are talking about the time where we are and the scripture says all the kings of the earth have made spiritual fornication with her meaning that they've got a great adoration towards this church system that the beast rights is of I mean that rights by the authority of the beast Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then in the face of all this, there is another worship where the elect on the other hand worships God in appreciation of his redemption. Are you together with me? When John realized that his name was in the book, are you together with me? The one who has his name in the book will worship God. We not miss a church service. We always be in his Bible. We always feed on the message. So we don't come to church to meet friends. This is not a you know a social society. Are you together with me? We come here because we realize that our names are written in the Lamb's book. Whoever has gone through the waters of separation and is in fellowship with God will be able to look for his brother so that he can have fellowship with him. Why do we do that? Because all of us come from God. You realize you are missing your brother. Hallelujah. And when we come down here because we have fellowship with God, we can have fellowship with one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't come here because the pastor preaches us happy. We come here because we already recognize the lordship of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We realize how great the hope has been to our lives. We realize where grace picked us from. We realize that even if you are not what you want to be, you are not what you used to be. So therefore, you come into his presence. Keep worshiping by the washing waters of the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where would I be without Calvary? The answer is very simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would be a drunker lying in the gutters in what I would be. I would be a prostitute out there in the prostitute houses in my body. Sometimes I would be a witch. Sometimes I would be a senseless bugler breaking in houses of hardworking people. I would be a hopeless husband, taking away peace from my family. But the grace of God has made me what I am. That's what I come to church for. Is that amen for you? You are not here to meet your friends. Amen. I would be a condemned sinner and a sure candidate for the lake of fire. Amen. that the elect will worship the lamb in this same time because he has a revelation of who he is. He knows who he came to believe. Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Because the book of redemption is revealed and the elected enter by the opening of the seventh seal. So when the book of redemption broke open to John and he saw his name, oh praise the Lord, he lifted up his hands in what worship. Have you seen your name? Can you be able to say amen? Because your name is in the lamb's book of life. Amen. As the ministers preach the word, you keep saying that's me. You keep saying that's me. Because the minister is holding a mirror for you so that you can see who you are. that you are washed in the blood, that you are a son of God, that you predestinated that the enemy, Satan cannot and should not block you from going into the holy of holies to lift up your hearts, those holy saraphim to worship God, holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty. The true purpose in life comes with God revealing his word to you. Worship now. Amen. Is to those in the end time who have seen their names in the lamb's book of life. That's what it is. It will be a clear cut in the end time. &gt;&gt; So we go back into the book of Genesis. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What goes back way back in the book of Genesis? It was genuine. Because there were two people, &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve, &gt;&gt; whose names were in the in the Lamb's book of life. And God was the first builder of the house of God. In the evening time, he could come to the tabernacle. And then Adam and Eve and Eve &gt;&gt; would be there to worship God. See this what I'm saying that if we have been redeemed and taken back to the moment of Adam before the fall when the word begins to unfold it so you don't even walk out to go out of church. You are there to wait for the next statement the Holy Ghost is going to bring forth. Amen. God knows those that are his and when they got their knees, he hears them is because they were created to worship. That's the boldness. That's what we were created for. But sin separated us from it. But when the blood came and brided the gap, it has the boldness which takes you to worship. Not your righteousness now, but it's the blood of Jesus. It takes you to the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; The cherubims with the flaming is no longer there. But what God made is come to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Those men, the creation of God, and character was designed to worship God. And when they move into worship, they fit in the description of what a worshshiper is. When Abdel entered into there, fitted into the description [Applause] what a worshiper is because his name amen was in the lamb's book of life those men who worship God who got the three sets of saraphim wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Today &gt;&gt; I want to bring you to what brother Brham told us. He described to us the nature of the saraphim relating it back to the washer. Amen. These saraphim they had their wings and then another set covered their feet and another set they fly. Are you together with me? They cover their faces in reference &gt;&gt; to the presence. Are you together with me? So you come down here and then you become reverent to the presence of God in the presence of the in the ministry of brother Brana when he was always going into the prayer life he would say I'm waiting on him and when the angel of the Lord came down he would say he's here now and then he says Be real reverent now. Be reverent now. Are you together with me? And he says now when you jump scream, you jump out of it. Be reverent now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Be like those angels. Be like the saraphims. They don't come to church to chew on chewing gum. They don't come to church looking at the hour. They come to church and they are still until the preacher is done because the work of the preacher doesn't come. It is the washing waters of the world. The preacher is not washing himself. The preacher when he preaches pouring the washing water. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature is that another set covered their feet in humility. They get in the spirit of service. Amen. They don't come to church to listen to the accent. They come to church because they are, you know, that's where they are supposed to be. Creation created them that way and fitted them with those saraphim wings to recognize that presence and be in that presence. They know how to bring God down. They don't come to watch a preacher. They come to feed on the word. And when the word gets home, they know how to say amen. Amen. They don't come down to participate in a daily service. No sir. He come down here to have a service like the one they had in the times of Israel where a man stood up behind a wooden pulpit open the word says out of the world others were lifting up their saying amen. When you say amen you are not doing anything wrong. You are just being in the word. Praise the Lord. You see, they sit still until they see the goodness of the Lord. Amen. And then there was another set. This is the set to fly with. They are active. They are not dominant. They don't come to church to become wall flowers. When they come to church because they come from God, they always sensitive about their calling in the body. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If they are to sing, they sing the best way possible. If they are preachers, they preach the best way possible. They are prayer warriors. They pray the best way possible. Their boldiness has been provided. You don't need to stay away because the blood of Jesus has atoned for the condition. Amen. Everybody knows his position in Christ and happily serves in it. Amen. We are supposed to be flying fields. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the elect cannot afford according to this description to be arrogant and live in the presence of the Lord at the same time. Arrogant. No, it is not possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he knows that he's he is because of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. He is &gt;&gt; because of the grace of Cal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when Cain tried his worship, it could not be received. Why? &gt;&gt; He was not created with those attributes. He didn't come from God. He was not created fitted to worship. Are you together with me? He evidently lacked reverence and he didn't also have humility. He didn't have the wings. God does not deal with arrogant spirit. There are some people that will never be under anybody unless they are the one leading. I thank God I have a pastor. Are you together with me? There are some arrogant spirits that they cannot just afford to be under anybody unless they're the ones leading. God have mercy. God does you know the kingdom of God is about the nature and attribute of the saraphims. Look at them. They don't have any sin in them but look at the reverence with which they come to God. How about me, a man washed by the blood of Jes? How much more humble should I be? Kane's name's name was not found in the lamb's book of Revelation 13. Because Cain was not found Even in Genesis, his worship could not be received. &gt;&gt; Do you see now? Because Genesis is the seed book and Revelation is the harvest book. The name that was not in the lamb's book in Genesis. could not worship and in the end time that name again will not be able to worship. When you look at the character and the nature of the of the uh of the saraphim, you begin to watch yourself and say where do I lack in this and say God have mercy upon me. The gin seed in the elect in the n the non-elect. I begin from that angle. The gene of life in the non seed [Music] speaks the language of Cain. Because the language of Ken says, "From thy press, from thy face shall I be hid." Are you together with me? From thy face shall I be he. I don't want to go to church. That's the language of Cain. After he was found in sea, instead of humbling, he walked farther away in the east. And he said, "From thy face shall I be hid? Will you be hid from the face of the Lord? Will you always have the boldiness to come into the house of the Lord? Have fellowship with your brothers. These are the people you are going to share with. Amen. Amen. Are you together with me? But Kane says, "I will not be a church boy no more. They desert the presence after a mistake." And he says, "I shall be a fugitive and a vagabot." Are you together with me? He's only swearing negative things. If I hurt, that's what I am. If I don't forgive, that's who I am. You know when I read the scripture the other day, I found out that Cain after going out to sacrifice with his brother, it was after that God says no your uh sacrifice has been rejected. Amen. And then he says if you only consulted your prayer You would also be accepted. But there are some people that even don't like to consumpt. But yet iron sharpens iron. Amen. When you come to church, you are consulting your breath because he's talking to you is answering the questions of your heart in the preaching of the word. Amen. Amen. You must remember is not immediately at the altar that Kane killed his brother. No, it is afterwards. I don't know after how long time is not put there. It could be after 5 years, maybe after 10 years. Then he told his brother, "Let us go back to the garden. Poor sheep following Cain who says, "From thy face shall I be healed." and you see some poor sheep in a local church following some gods. There's no forgiveness. There's no, you know, tying that, you know, thing upon the heart. I will never forgive you. your your sacrifice accepted mine rejected and God says me to consult you 10 years later let's go to the garden are you together with me just like who was of that wicked one &gt;&gt; and slew his breath even in the end time they don't try worship again. That's why the scripture says that all that dwell upon the earth shall worship the beast whose names are not written in the lamb of life the foundation of the world. Are you together with me? So when you come here You are giving your testimony. My name is in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The lamb has got the ways of his life written in a book. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if you live by the way of the lamb's book of life, then you'll be able to worship God in the end time. A true believer should not close light and fire with that kind of class in the end time. That's why the scripture says, "Come out of my people. Why? Let's go to the garden. Let's go to the garden. And now when you get to the garden, he's trying to pluck out every seed that has been planted into that innocent heart. God have mercy. Listen now. Let's deal a little bit with the Lamb's Book of Life. The lamb's book. It doesn't say book that belongs to the lamb, but the lamb's book of life. Meaning that the ways of life of the lamb has been written here. And those who walk by the ways of this book shows that they came from the same source with the lamb. They were created and designed with a worshshiper's nature. Are you together with me? Amen. Amen. So now this the message Hebrews chapter 5 and 6. Brother Brham says, "Oh, I know there is many rise up and go out and say, "Oh, I don't need to go to church anymore. Praise God. The Holy Ghost has come. He's the teacher." When you get that idea, you are just wrong. For why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church? He's if he was going to be the teacher, they are first apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. The Holy Spirit, set teachers in the church. So he could teach through the teachers. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said teach us in the church that he could teach by the teacher. That's why we come to church. We have the boldness. The boldness tells me that. But if you run away, if your life is wanting, amen, then that means you didn't come from God. But if your life is wanting, the Bible says you run. That's when you go to the Holy of Holies. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The blood went before you. So you need the boldness because the blood went before you. You are safe in whatsoever condition to go to the house of the Lord. Whether you are righteous or you in a state that's not perfect, this is where you can find help. Amen. The true seed &gt;&gt; will lab to identify with the other seeds in service. Now listen, the only time Adam did not get into the divine presence was when sin had set him when Jesus, &gt;&gt; the anointing, the Holy Ghost, the Lord came into the tabernacle. He said, "Adam, where are you?" And he says, "I have hidden." And then he did say, "Are you sick?" He said, "No. Have you eaten of the tree?" He knows the only thing that keeps a man away from church is the condition of his soul. When people are sick, sometimes they come and we pray for them. But the reason why people stay away is because their souls are sick. They've eaten of the fruit. God have mercy. Because at that time, God put a cherubim with a flying I mean with a shining sword. But today the cherubim has been taken away. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus calls you to the oath in any condition you are in. Come to the church. It's the house of correction. It's where you find the washing waters. This is where you belong. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The lamb has his book of life and your name is in that book. And brother Brana &gt;&gt; he says that that name is not nephew or &gt;&gt; no he says that name can only identify by you when you read the word &gt;&gt; and then you realize &gt;&gt; the word is talking to you when the word recommends a way of life which is the way of the lamb and then you feel like that's what you desire then that's your name in the book that's why today you are identified with worship you come to church because your name requires that in that book we find the names of the elect. And I told you the name signifies character. The name is the character &gt;&gt; of those who are identified with the life of the lamb written in the book. That's simple. Tell your brother, "My name is in the lamb's book of Yes, sir. It's there. Praise the Lord. And as you walk, you come to church, that button on the inside begins to get brighter and brighter and brighter. Are you together with me? Every time you listen to the exaltations, that battle becomes brighter. Every time you come to church, that button becomes brighter. You hear what I'm saying? That's your boldiness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Amen. The lamb's life is the charact of worship because worship is the way of life for the elect. When we get out of here, when the nature of sin has been washed away, the original purpose will be restored. We are not going to be engineers up there. We are going to be washers. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we had rather begin to practice now our God because that's what we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has the names of those who shares the same life with the lamb. Amen. These are eternal because they originated from the same source with the lamb. They share of that life. They think like the lamb. They speak like the lamb. They act like the lamb. because they live by the life of the lamb. Are you together with me? They are dead to theirselves and alive because the lamb's life lives in that spot where their lives used to live. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now it takes away that wrong life. Then the life of the lamb comes at the center. When the lamb keeps looking from up yonder, when the seraraphims look from up yonder and they look like this, they say look holy, holy, holy to the Lord. The whole earth is filled with his glory. They see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says, "Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God and gave himself for me." Amen. So I am as eternal as the lamb is eternal. Did you hear that? If you are a son of God, amen, you are as eternal as the son of God is eternal because you came from the same source. He broke off of himself his own spirit to make you. Let's make man in our image and in our form. That's your nature. That's why you've got the ability to go before God and worship. That's why when sin gets into your life, you know where to run back to because you cannot run towards the devil because you know what happens. It is fire out there. They will ask David now you have done something wrong. Would you want to fall in the hands of your enemy? And he says, "No, no, no, no, no. I would rather fall in the hands of God." How many of you would rather fall in the hands of God? I would rather fall in the hands of God. That's what my desire is. Anything wrong, I run back to the Holy of Holies. The door is open for me by the blood of the lamb. I came from the same spirit to live the life of the lamb here on earth. You are eternal beings in a natural body. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. You are eternal beings in a natural body. So this natural body is putting up a fight against you on the Israel and say I will fight a good fight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; My daughter always keeps asking me my granddaughter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She says, "Dather, if the stranger comes to touch me, what would you do?" I say, "I would punch him. You beat him." And what would he say? I say he would cry out. And then he says, "Okay, will God hear?" I says, "Yes, you have ears and you are protected. Are you together with me? Yeah. We are little children. God cannot afford to lose us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must beat off the effects of the hybrid body. We must beat off. Amen. The effects of the hybrid body so that we can be able to worship. He beats off these commitments. You know I work a six day and then on Sunday I am tired but pastor you brought the zoom. So I'm always there when you are drinking your cup of coffee and you are eating bread and butter you are zooming in and then you are saying that's right that's correct to show you have been present God have mercy We need to come into this presence. This is where the anointing is. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord to the elect. &gt;&gt; You know me, I didn't like that. Uh what do you call it? That uh streaming streaming. &gt;&gt; It's the pastor. me I'm from that analog age where I want to look at the people and I can be able to know this one here is resenting me this one here is taking it you know when you stand here the Holy Spirit refuse the people to you like That's why people say that pastor who tells him things nobody tells you but when you sit here the Holy Spirit takes over. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now you see we must be willing. We must be able to beat off the effects of this flesh. which is the seed on this side. The spirit is always this thing here is always weak until that on the inside and begins run to the water brooks. Amen. Whether you are hurt Because when that is called a heart, when it is hurt, it does not stop until it gets to the water brooks. These are the water brooks with all these I mean pillars of fire around a mighty presence of the Lord. It doesn't matter whether you are hurt, you tell God, I must go to the water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I cannot just kind of get satisfied with painted fires on on streaming. Praise God. Now &gt;&gt; there is a nature &gt;&gt; his nature you were created to worship. &gt;&gt; I want you to confess this I was created to worship. So your entire life is about worship. You know, God told Moses, "Go and tell Pharaoh that let my people go and worship me." Pharaoh says, "Oh, it's okay. They can go and they can come back. Let them leave the children." says no. Everything of ours will have to go and worship. My car will go and worship the Lord. It will take me to church. My children must be taught how to worship God. So the worship actually God was meaning was an Exodus. from a a heathen life and a lifestyle that was commanded and led by the word. That's why God was in their planting. God was in their worship. God was in their feast. God was in their children. There are circum everything of that kind we shall get an opportunity and expand those elements. God separated them to make them a church called out people who live a life of worship. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And in our time today, the Lord has gone before us. open a way to bring this assembly here to live a life of worship that we can come together. We can tell what God has done through the week. We can be able to testify. We can tell our conditions. Then our brothers will pray for us. We have the boldness by the blood of Jesus. to the holy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So if you feel a call to worship, then there is a seed gene in you that needs to be awakened. And this awakened gene is the one which will beat the influences of the flesh because it will be thirsty. It should be thirsty. It can leave a palace. And there he was happy. When they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. If the king can leave a house of M and go, how about you leaving these simple houses with tiles to come into the house of the Lord? Tell your brother, I belong to the house of God. Amen. You are here because there is a pool and this pool causes you sometimes to pray in the closet in your house. That pull causes you to forgive. That pull causes you to do the works of Christ. Are you together with me? You testify. You can do anything. You can't pass a book. Whatever you can do. Yes. Because there is a call on the inside. The message go tell. Brother Bronham says, "Praise the Lord, Lord God, for my precious little brother here." That was a prayer line the deepness and depth of his spirit cause like the deep calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because God is one deep and we we another deep and then the deep &gt;&gt; was caught in the deep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are the deep that are part of God. The deep goes to the deep. The only one that can hear from God is the one who has got the seed gene. Some of them may be tears. So you don't listen to the tears. You listen to the deep call going to your deep. Praise the Lord. He wants the Holy Spirit. He's respected your servants in every way that he could by the power of the Holy Ghost. May it come upon my brother and he be filled with God's power and grace, the Holy Ghost. Receive him. Receive him as I commit. He says, "I see his deep." Is God seeing your deep today? If you are a hungry soul, I want you to hear this also. When the beep calls to the deep, it takes more than joining a church. It takes more than shaking hands with a preacher. It takes more than living a good straight life. It takes something to satisfy inside of you that powers down from God into the soul. The deep calling to the deep at the noise of thy waters sprout. Oh Lord, the deep calling to the deep. There must be something pouring from God into your soul. Are you together with him? There must be something get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Abraham had something holding. He could st out of the land, but there was something that was calling him always back to the Holy of Holies. Do you feel a call to the hall of holies to come into his presence to worship the Lord this afternoon? So worship is linked with eternity first. That deep dropping into the deep and coming into a union, the husband and wife. You being a bride, there must be something come together with you to bring forth a life that can worship God. Not on a particular mountain, not in Jerusalem. So going to church is good, but linking with eternity sparks the anointing of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 4:23, &gt;&gt; he says, "But the hour cometh, &gt;&gt; and now is when the truth worippers, the true worippers." Now he's not saying worshippers because Cain worshipped. But he says the true worshipper &gt;&gt; shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father taketh search to worship him. And the scripture says, "The son of man came to seek and to find." What is he looking for? That seed. You remember the ego story. The mother ego when he came. Amen. Hurrying up in the space knowing her voice. He was looking for something specific that came from him. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He seeketh such to worship him because God is a spirit. And they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Now listen here. We worship in spirit. &gt;&gt; And it's only those that came from the spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Amen. That can worship in the spirit. And those are the ones that can stay with the truth &gt;&gt; in spirit because they come from the spirit and truth because they are part of that truth. They come from that spirit so that we can be able to worship in spirit. Let us make man in our image. And when we receive his word, we abide in the word. Amen. So coming from the same spirit, abiding in the same character of the world on the constant spirit and truth. For there is a nature in you where the dove can come and roast and that way he can take over your life and you'll be able to worship because you are alive upon which the father spirit can come upon you because he comes with the same nature. So are you together with me? Let us go to Romans chapter 8. Look at this. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 verse 26. He says, "Likewise, the spirit also helps our infirmities." He helps our infirmities. Amen. Amen. For we know not what we should pray for as we, but the spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. So in this scripture, the Holy Spirit comes in as a comforter. He steps into your weakness as a comforter, the advocate. He knows what we want and yet we cannot perform the right approach because many times when you are caught in something wrong, your heart melts. Amen. You don't have the boldness. You cannot sit stand before God and say, "Father's mercy upon you." You need an you need the Holy Spirit. Amen. To go with you through the strips of blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Into the Holy of Holies. Listen what the prophet says here. Sometimes when we go to the Holy Ghost, we ignorantly stagger into something. Amen. And sometimes when you know, but the nature pulls you that way. The son of God cannot stay there because he knows that a blood strip has been beat all the way from where he is to the master seat. Where will you find if you run away from his presence? Come into his presence. Amen. The Holy Spirit is there to take advocate for us. He's our advocator. He stands there. He's our attorney. He stands there and pleads for us. We don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in us pleads for us. Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you cannot understand and he makes intercessions for us. That's what the Holy Ghost is. When I walk into anything, I walk like a a little kid. We walk like a little fellow. We walk in a dark world full of enemies, full of sin, full of traps, full of everything. You Oh, I'm afraid to take a Christian life. I'm afraid to do this. I'm afraid I'll do this. Don't be afraid. We have an advocate. He stands by us. He's in us and he makes intercessions for us. The Holy Spirit constantly making an advocate for us all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So petition him and the advocate will be present to petition before the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't wait saying that, oh maybe I need to be perfect before I approach the father. You need to go the father and the lord of your sin and it is him. He will bring you into the perfect work. He doesn't call us to throw our burdens before we go to him. Because that way you would have never needed a savior. But he says come unto me all you who labor as a heavy carry your burdens and come to me. You start coming and you are limping and you are fearing and you are afraid but he has called come unto me. Amen. Come at me. Come at me. So there is an advocate and the advocate &gt;&gt; is not for the seed of Cain. The advocate is there to advocate for the seed gene of God. Meaning that you can be a seed and as the prophet uses the word You stagger. What shows you a receipt is to run back to the father to thank God for the advocate because he receives you with your burden and he takes it away and gives you his yoke. And when you take his yoke, he says, "Learn from me, what does that mean that present yourself to where you can learn from him? Come back to the house of the Lord. He has bless teaching priests to learn from him." So the blood is the open door to worship. As you walk into the fountain, you are just opening up into presence. Do you love him? Do you love the presence of the Lord? Amen. So the blood is the open door to divine worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now during the season of the son of man listen on earth some Greeks came to Jerusalem to worship. I want to put an emphasis here on the blood because without the blood they cannot be worshiped. much as you may need to worship like these Greeks who came on the feast of the Passover, the season of the blood atonement because they had heard of the miracles. They had heard the signs, the wonders, the nature and character of Christ. Amen. as it was defined. So they came amen to Philip and they said sir we would see Jesus. But the scripture earlier on says they had come to Jerusalem to worship. So Jesus with that prophetic anointing. He knew what they were looking for. They were looking for an object of worship. They were looking for God. They came to worship. So they came to Philillip and they said s would see Jesus. Philip went to Andrew and together they went to Jesus. But when the two disciples came to Christ, the revelation of the purpose of him coming into the world broke open to him and was very eminent. some person to come to me and say there are some Greeks that desire to worship [Music] because the records in the word. It says that they came to worship him. They came to worship him because they wanted a miracle. They washed him because he had performed a miracle. But these Greeks, they came to worship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; I like those Greeks. &gt;&gt; They came to worship. And when this was brought to the master, the master answered and said in John 12:23, "And Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified." Very ver very I say unto you, except the cord of which fall into the ground and die, it abides alone, but if it die, bringeth forth much fruit. So the time had come for Jesus to open the gate into the Holy of Holies. The time had come for the curtain to be torn from top to bottom. The time had come for the cherab beans to put back those shining swords into their pro that everybody to have the access to go into the hall of holy. Hallelujah. He to feed his life. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord to have a great harvest. He shed the blood. He opened the worship. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The blood because it breaches the chasm that was caused by sin. And by this blood, we get the B to enter into the holiness. by the blood of Jesus. The blood needed to be there. Has the blood moved ever since? The blood all the way from Calvary has never lost its power until the last elected is safe to sin no more. So let's wind up with Hebrews here chapter 10 verse 19. Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by our righteousness. Does it say so? No. by the blood of Jesus. So this morning in whatsoever condition the blood has opened the way for you go into the hall of holies and after you've gone in there then you realize the righteousness of God. His perfection comes upon you. You walk a life that stays under sanctification by the study of the word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am talking about the presence of the blood this week. I am therefore talking about the boldness. Enter into the holiest. How many of you believe you've been washed by the blood? That's your boldness. every wickedness remember the fountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. With the blood of bulls and goats, &gt;&gt; the high priests entered timidly. But with this blood, the repenting sinner is getting in there. Amen. under the boldiness of the presence of the blood into the presence worship breaking in revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the blood. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. When we break it that revelation, we see the fountain flowing in and then out of the soul. Praise the Lord. The fountain flowing in and then out. Something drops from the deep. That's the life. behind the blood drops in here and builds a fountain of grace and then &gt;&gt; you are a worshipper &gt;&gt; and then your conscience gets washed. &gt;&gt; If anything else comes that's a good fight. It's a good fight. When you get in temptations, when you get in trials, it's a good fight. You ought to fight it and be able to overcome. Don't become like a king. From thy presence shall I hide. Go back. This is where you belong. [Music] with blood. &gt;&gt; I want to hear it. Don't [Music] me. I see blood. That flood lo there again. &gt;&gt; Are you having stains of guilt? Come to the blood. We are still in Hebrews. Before I finish verse 21 and verse 22. and having a high priest over the house of God. Let us draw near. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not draw away. Let us draw near with a true heart. You don't come to church trying to find whether you can stay. No, a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from univerience and our bodies wash with a pure water. That's the boldness to enter to the real worship. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Before I finish, &gt;&gt; I want you to know that your conscience is sprinkled. Amen. You don't think yourself towards evil. You think yourself towards righteousness. And when something wrong, gets into your life. You don't think yourself towards hell. You think yourself towards restoration. And I want to see restoration this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. A heart fully assured, fully the sprinkling of the blood wash the conscious of self condemnation. to have a self condemnation. When Jesus himself at for you, why do you condemn yourself? You need to come into the house of worship. You come into the holy of holies and you fall before him and you say, "Father, I am here." You need to become that prodigal son. Don't become that from thy presence shall I be healed. When you make a mistake in your presence shall I come. That's the sea. Amen. So at Calvary when the blood was finally released he didn't say you are condemned. He says it's finished. What has been finished that I have released the city, &gt;&gt; the life in the blood. Amen. Come down and get united to the seed gene in your soul. And when that happens, it ignites the life of the lamb in your life. That's the only way you can have the life of the lamb by the life that was in the blood to unite himself with your seed of something supernatural and be born in you. And when he released the blood, he said it's finished. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; It is finished in the sense that you have attained your salvation and the door to the hall of holies is now open for you. You can enter the holiest to express yourself in worship. You are God's finished work. He said it's finished. in the Old Testament. He would go every year. He would go every year. That's the priest, the high priest. But when he went in, Hallelujah. He rose after taking captivity captive and he ascended up your hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He presented the blood as the master seat and then the Bible said he sat down. Hallelujah. Because he's not coming back into the temple again, the natural temple. He finished the redemption and he sat down. It is finished. He has given you everything you need to live the life of a Christian. Ephesians 2:10 say you are his workmanship. So you have everything that moves you into the presence of God to worship. Sometimes you become so fundamental in determining whether we can or we cannot enter into the holiest to worship. Mhm. The door is open for you. Sometimes we become so fundamental to the extreme as whether we can receive the Holy Ghost or we may not. But God, he gave his son, &gt;&gt; died for your condition, &gt;&gt; and he says it's finished. And good news for you, he's still at the master seat. He's still there. What is he there for? For you. Because as long as you are in this flesh is because there is a work God still wants to do on your life. If you are away from the heavenly places, I want you to do one thing. declare yourself, that prodigal son, &gt;&gt; and you say, "I'll go back to the father and confess my shortcomings. Have sinned against heaven and in thy sight. I'm no more worth to be called thy son. But as far as the father is concerned once a son forever son. Why? Because the seed &gt;&gt; is eternal. God bless you. The seed is eternal. You are a child of God. Praise God. God will follow to catch up with you to build a feeling on the inside like he built in that prodigal son who was begging to eat of sheep's food. But being a son, the deep began to call to the deep Do you have a deep that's calling to the deep this afternoon? You have a deep. &gt;&gt; You are a child of God. The suffer with blood from me. You will see. [Music] Why don't we stand up and raise our hands? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh yes. and we start to feel like a grace cannot cover our condition. But heavenly father, there's nothing stronger &gt;&gt; than the grace that brought you from heaven &gt;&gt; to pour the blood that you yourself. Your eternal spirit may come down in the upper room and keep coming down. Every other congregation sins [Music] to attach yourself as a pill of fire upon the seed chin in the lives of the people they are yours every eternal may you come down every fire shake out every situation in the lives of your children because you love You will never lose any. Father, I therefore pray that you may go and stand before every soul that seeketh to be restored in the name of Jesus. May the grace of God rule over us. They are your children. They are yours. Amazing grace. will deserve. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's amazing grace, brother. &gt;&gt; So amazing &gt;&gt; to say a race like you and me. I Christ God.

Lord, what shall we be without that grace? But give us the grace that we may display the attributes of the saraphim. Always reverent to the calling of God and always heavenly father, humble and willing to serve. I pray dear Lord Jesus that these are your children. Embrace them. bring them before the Lord and just negotiate a little bit with them, Father. Because here and there there are ways of evil that grip your children, but they are your children, Father. Bring them back to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] [Applause] I love him. I love &gt;&gt; I tell you I love him, brother. [Music] Oh yes.
