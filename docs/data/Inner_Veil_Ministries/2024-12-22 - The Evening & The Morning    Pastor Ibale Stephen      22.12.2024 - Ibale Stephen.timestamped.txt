[37:24] 2 let's pray father father we have come
[37:28] before your
[37:30] presence for one
[37:32] purpose to worship you to praise you to
[37:37] glorify your
[37:38] name and to hear you speak to
[37:41] us from your word so father we
[37:46] dedicate the reading of the word the
[37:49] hearing of it and the preaching of it
[37:54] father that you may anoint
[37:55] it tremendous to our
[37:58] hearts we seek to see you in your
[38:02] word father bless it and anoint it in
[38:07] Jesus name amen am amen
[38:12] amen
[38:17] genesis4
[38:18] um do you love
[38:21] him that's where we are reading oh no
[38:24] this is how bring it down
[38:29] Genesis
[38:32] 1:4 and God
[38:35] saw the light that it was
[38:39] good and God divided the light from the
[38:47] darkness and God called the light
[38:51] day and the Darkness called he
[38:55] night and the
[38:58] evening and the morning were the first
[39:07] day may the Lord had blessing the
[39:09] reading of his
[39:11] word amen we can continue may be
[39:15] seated we can continue to Matthew
[39:17] chapter
[39:19] 25 verse one I will take about 30
[39:25] minutes to build the plat
[39:29] to the subject that we are going to deal
[39:33] with and this is teaching
[39:36] now because with
[39:39] preaching you can be able to understand
[39:43] everything in just one
[39:48] go but you know when one is trying to
[39:52] teach you are trying to gather facts
[39:55] from different angles
[39:59] to be able to bring
[40:02] forth I mean a standing you know
[40:08] picture amen Matthew
[40:11] 25 verse
[40:13] 1 to
[40:15] six then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[40:19] likened down to 10 virgins which took
[40:23] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[40:26] bridegroom
[40:37] and five of them were wise and five were
[40:47] foolish they that were foolish St their
[40:50] lamps and took no oil with them
[40:59] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[41:02] with their
[41:09] lamps while the bridegroom Ted they all
[41:12] slamed and
[41:18] slept and at
[41:21] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[41:25] bridegroom coming
[41:27] go out to meet
[41:37] him God bless you so I have the
[41:42] title this
[41:44] morning the
[41:46] evening and the
[41:49] morning the
[41:51] evening and the
[41:53] morning so many times we talk about the
[41:57] wise and foolish
[42:02] virgins but many times we do that from a
[42:05] limited
[42:08] angle but we want to expand this
[42:12] thought so first of
[42:15] all I want to bring up the thought of
[42:22] dispensationalism Amen so you know a
[42:26] dispensation
[42:28] is a way of God strictly looking at you
[42:32] know one particular
[42:39] subject in a particular season of
[42:43] time so in this
[42:46] season he releases an outstanding
[42:50] Grace in a certain direction of
[42:55] emphasis and this does not
[42:57] mean that everything else comes to a
[43:02] stop but you know while he's
[43:05] covering
[43:12] thought still goes out and does
[43:14] everything that makes him
[43:18] God Amen so but in the
[43:22] dispensation God can stretch out his
[43:26] hand also in other
[43:28] areas so we shall use the
[43:31] term of God Crossing you know stretching
[43:36] his
[43:39] hand to do
[43:43] something different from the emphasis of
[43:47] the
[43:49] Season we shall call it God Crossing
[43:53] dispensational Borders
[43:58] amen so I dispensation
[44:06] really I don't know what he can call it
[44:08] in
[44:09] luganda can anybody give it a better
[44:12] definition a
[44:18] dispensation praise the Lord so one way
[44:23] let's now try to understand the
[44:24] dispensation
[44:27] one who of understanding
[44:30] dispensations you'll just understand it
[44:33] as I try to show different ways of how
[44:37] dispensations
[44:41] were the word to dispense
[44:46] itself is to Ash
[44:49] around amen it's like you go to a
[44:53] dispensary
[44:57] they are dispensing medicine to
[45:00] you so a
[45:02] dispensation is God working in a period
[45:06] or season of
[45:09] time to put out something special for
[45:12] the people of that
[45:15] season so one of understanding
[45:19] dispensation is how God would not work
[45:24] among the Jews
[45:27] and the Gentiles at the same
[45:32] time but yet at the same
[45:36] time between the six and the seventh I
[45:39] mean
[45:45] SE God is
[45:47] seen working with the
[45:51] Gentiles and even the Jews at the same
[45:54] time is bringing Israel back to their
[45:59] Homeland as is bringing the church back
[46:01] into the homeland of the
[46:04] world so he has been restoring the
[46:08] Gentiles amen at the same time he's also
[46:13] bringing the Gentiles back into their
[46:16] Church
[46:19] land that's God still taking his hand
[46:22] across the borders of a dispensation
[46:28] we've always known
[46:30] God coming down in Three Sons
[46:36] Nam when he put on a body he came among
[46:40] us he was known as son of
[46:44] man when he was here on
[46:47] Earth as a teaching
[46:49] Prophet amen and then we also know that
[46:54] after Calvary
[46:57] to the coming of the Lord
[46:59] again we' got him seen I mean we've got
[47:02] him as the Son of
[47:05] God Amen somebody who Aton for the sins
[47:09] of the
[47:10] people these are titles of the same
[47:15] God but after he has done all that he
[47:18] has
[47:19] done then we expect him to come
[47:23] back and Rule a kingdom
[47:27] when he comes back as king now we see
[47:31] him as son of
[47:35] D hallelujah hallelujah but then
[47:38] sometimes we still see him Crossing
[47:41] those
[47:43] borders I want you to take in you know
[47:46] the understanding of a
[47:50] dispensation and then how God can still
[47:53] go and do some of works
[47:58] but yet holding a particular function
[48:03] here which is
[48:06] Major amen so we' had the son of
[48:09] man Son of God and we have been
[48:14] told that he would come again a son of
[48:18] man before he comes a son
[48:22] of so son of man was the dis
[48:27] sensation when Christ was on
[48:30] Earth he was a teaching
[48:34] Prophet amen so son of man means a
[48:39] prophet God would speak to
[48:42] Ezekiel and would tell him son of
[48:46] man amen son of man is a prophet
[48:52] title so Jesus had the title of the
[48:55] prophet
[48:57] when he was here on
[48:58] Earth and then after
[49:01] Cal we see a Son of
[49:04] God which is the
[49:06] dispensation of the Holy
[49:09] [Music]
[49:11] Ghost amen but according to St
[49:15] Luke which we are going to turn
[49:19] to chapter
[49:21] 17 before he comes
[49:24] back as son of David
[49:27] the king in the
[49:29] Millennium he falls back
[49:32] again in the office of the son of
[49:36] man amen are you together with me he was
[49:40] son of man when he was a prophet in the
[49:45] body of
[49:46] Flesh and then when he went
[49:49] away the Holy Spirit came
[49:52] back as Son of God in the
[49:55] church but
[49:57] before he comes as a king he gos back
[50:01] again into the first
[50:04] office of son of man let us look at St
[50:09] Luke chapter
[50:11] 17 and
[50:13] verse he says
[50:15] likewise also as it was in the days of
[50:20] Lord they did
[50:22] it they drank they B they sold they
[50:28] planted they build hallelujah hallelujah
[50:32] it was a prosperous
[50:36] age amen there was too much
[50:39] money that the people were living in
[50:44] Lu they were eating
[50:47] drinking they were buying homes and
[50:51] cars they were
[50:53] selling they planted it was an age of
[50:57] great
[50:59] Farmers like today they are talking
[51:01] about
[51:04] coffee and it's even bringing battles in
[51:08] Parliament amen because it's much money
[51:11] in
[51:12] coffee people are talking about things
[51:16] like uh
[51:18] Coco people are talking about
[51:22] vanilla they making
[51:24] money that was what it was the days of
[51:28] Sodom and then he says in verse
[51:31] 29 but the same day that lot went out of
[51:37] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[51:41] heaven and Destroy them
[51:44] all even
[51:47] thus shall it be the day when the son of
[51:50] man is
[51:54] revealed hallelujah hallelujah not when
[51:57] the son of man
[51:58] comes but when the son of man is
[52:05] revealed so there will be the revealing
[52:07] of the son of
[52:09] man and then the reve I mean the coming
[52:12] of the Son of
[52:14] God so we are talking about the
[52:18] situation as it was in
[52:20] Sodom when the son of man appeared
[52:25] briefly before the burning of
[52:28] Sodom amen he appeared to
[52:32] Abraham in the flesh of a man hallelujah
[52:37] hallelujah he came to him praise the
[52:40] Lord and the son of man was dressed in a
[52:44] body of
[52:46] Flesh he didn't go to
[52:49] everybody he went to the
[52:51] elect and that's
[52:54] Abraham hallelujah hallelujah and he
[52:56] came with two
[52:59] messages the first message was that in
[53:03] the time of
[53:04] life your wife
[53:07] Sarah is going to have a
[53:09] son and the second message was the
[53:13] destruction of
[53:14] Sodom so God came down at that time as a
[53:20] prophet in the season of
[53:24] prosperity in the cular world in Sodom
[53:29] Andor are you together with me and L the
[53:33] nominal
[53:35] Christian had become so powerful in
[53:39] Sodom he was directing the politics of
[53:42] the
[53:44] world Amen he had gone
[53:48] out amen from where God brought him
[53:53] out and living with his uncle
[53:58] Abraham and he had now
[54:00] gone and settled in
[54:03] Sodom and he became a very prosperous
[54:06] man now we are living in the last
[54:10] days but we should be
[54:13] careful that we should stay with the
[54:17] word because that's where God comes
[54:21] to God comes to his own
[54:24] one but in the last
[54:27] there will be a lot of
[54:29] prosperity a lot of making money these
[54:33] things should not take us away from
[54:36] God we must always stay by the
[54:39] word that's where we can have fellowship
[54:43] with amen but you find some people they
[54:48] meet a weekend of they miss a weekend of
[54:51] services because there is a deal of good
[54:54] money somewhere to make
[54:57] it's okay to make
[54:58] money but if it crosses the path of the
[55:03] world you should choose the better
[55:07] option amen always choose the better
[55:11] option because that's where God comes
[55:14] to because the word was with
[55:17] Abraham God came to Abraham it's Abraham
[55:21] who received the promise of
[55:23] life but the Lord who walked away from
[55:25] the world
[55:27] he received the promise of
[55:29] death s shall
[55:32] burn amen and we know how the age of
[55:37] prosperity
[55:40] burst in after the second world
[55:45] war amen at the time when
[55:49] God was meeting his
[55:52] prophet and commissioning him for the
[55:55] age
[55:58] amen
[56:00] 1945 but at the same
[56:02] time God keeps crossing his
[56:10] dispensations you know my wife always
[56:13] engages
[56:15] people and so she was talking to some
[56:19] people in
[56:21] Canada just 45 in
[56:24] 1945 after the
[56:26] wall how it was there and they were
[56:30] still carrying water on the
[56:34] head you see they were still doing that
[56:38] but all of a
[56:40] sudden Bo a lot of
[56:44] prosperity they've gone so far to the
[56:48] moon to the
[56:51] Mars you know theyve done so many things
[56:57] it's unbelievable how science has taken
[57:00] a giant
[57:03] liap but is
[57:06] god making it
[57:08] possible or making it discernable for
[57:12] us amen but this is another age of
[57:18] Sodom it's another age of
[57:22] prosperity but while they prosper
[57:26] be an
[57:28] Abraham in the PLS of
[57:31] mam maintaining the alt of
[57:34] prayer maintaining the O of
[57:38] sacrifice looking for the promise of the
[57:40] coming
[57:42] son hallelujah hallelujah praise God do
[57:46] you love him
[57:47] friends amen so we understand here that
[57:53] God does not cross I mean but normally
[57:57] in a dispensation he does one thing at a
[58:03] time but once
[58:05] again we are coming at a space of
[58:10] time amen where he is crossing the
[58:17] dispensation because since
[58:21] pent we have had the dispensation of the
[58:24] Gentiles
[58:26] and the Jews rejected
[58:29] Christ they have nothing to do with
[58:33] him so it is a gentile
[58:36] [Music]
[58:39] dispensation but then the scripture
[58:42] says there will be again the revealing
[58:45] of the son of
[58:49] man like he appeared for a short space
[58:52] of
[58:54] time before Sodom B and he came with a
[58:59] message hallelujah hallelujah so also in
[59:02] this
[59:03] time amen God has come down among the
[59:09] Gentiles with the revealing of the son
[59:12] of
[59:14] man and the revealing of the son of
[59:17] man will be the ministry of
[59:21] Christ in a body of
[59:23] Flesh because that's how God came to
[59:27] Abraham he came in a body of
[59:30] Flesh and then he spoke to Abraham he
[59:33] gave him a promise sah shall have a son
[59:37] but Sodom shall be
[59:39] destroyed are you together with me so in
[59:43] this Gentile
[59:45] dispensation God has come down among the
[59:50] Gentiles amen praise the Lord and at the
[59:54] same time Crossing his
[59:58] boundaries what is he doing he's getting
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:03] Jews taking them back to the
[1:00:06] Homeland is getting the
[1:00:09] Gentiles
[1:00:12] revealing the son of man
[1:00:15] today and we thank God we have seen the
[1:00:18] revealing of the son of
[1:00:21] man God has come down with a prophetic
[1:00:25] Ministry
[1:00:27] in our day praise the Lord and he has
[1:00:30] given us a promise that there will be
[1:00:34] born the St of a perfect
[1:00:38] man amen like Abraham had to receive
[1:00:43] Isaac you have to receive the
[1:00:46] son in another form Christ the statue of
[1:00:50] the
[1:00:51] perfect that in you can be faith
[1:00:56] and knowledge and patience and godliness
[1:01:00] and brotherly kindness so that you can
[1:01:07] be by charity himself this is the season
[1:01:10] where we are
[1:01:11] living amen while he's working among
[1:01:15] us he has crossed again he has going to
[1:01:19] bring back the
[1:01:20] Jews back into their
[1:01:23] Homeland why because the time is come
[1:01:27] the Messiah is soon coming we must meet
[1:01:30] them in the land to bring them back
[1:01:33] again into the
[1:01:37] gospel praise the Lord so I still want
[1:01:41] to show
[1:01:42] you something on dispensations
[1:01:46] here using the three
[1:01:50] phases the three
[1:01:52] phases of the work of Grace
[1:01:57] when we you know we've had the work of
[1:02:02] Grace manifesting in three
[1:02:06] phases there is
[1:02:10] justification now listen justification
[1:02:13] here is God finding you in the
[1:02:17] gut amen you are
[1:02:20] drunk you are nothing you have been a
[1:02:24] killer youve been to
[1:02:27] doctors and then you say
[1:02:30] Lord me he forgives you
[1:02:34] instant instantly the moment you
[1:02:38] mention there is nothing against you
[1:02:42] anymore amen that is
[1:02:46] justification you stand like you never
[1:02:48] did
[1:02:49] it amen and then after that because you
[1:02:54] are continuing here on
[1:02:56] us he takes you to the next
[1:03:00] pH which we call
[1:03:03] sanctification this phase here is God
[1:03:07] putting in the
[1:03:09] word that whatever he
[1:03:11] teaches and you receive it it makes you
[1:03:15] a better
[1:03:17] you amen then you learn to know why you
[1:03:21] should dress
[1:03:23] different because you represent the
[1:03:25] Bride of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ are you together with me totally
[1:03:30] different you learn how to live as a
[1:03:35] man responsible to keep your
[1:03:38] family you are no longer spending nights
[1:03:40] in the
[1:03:42] bar what's making you
[1:03:45] that it's the word it is putting in a
[1:03:49] phase of
[1:03:51] sanctification amen and when you are
[1:03:54] sanctified
[1:03:56] then down comes the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost he comes to dwell in his
[1:04:01] house which he has
[1:04:03] washed with his own blood now he says
[1:04:07] yeah this house here is worthy for the
[1:04:12] priest to
[1:04:15] C amen so first phase in
[1:04:22] Grace is your justification
[1:04:26] that doesn't have a stopping
[1:04:28] point it keeps
[1:04:31] running and runs into
[1:04:35] sanctification which also has no
[1:04:38] stopping and it keeps running and runs
[1:04:42] into the BM of the Holy
[1:04:44] Ghost are you together with me so God
[1:04:49] somehow as we have always said he will
[1:04:52] always cross his boundaries
[1:04:56] amen you are
[1:04:58] Justified it's all right praise God you
[1:05:02] are a Justified Son of
[1:05:04] God Amen but then as you walk you've
[1:05:09] come into
[1:05:10] sanctification then you find you have
[1:05:14] made a mistake and immediately you say
[1:05:18] father was
[1:05:19] me you get washed and as you are washed
[1:05:24] even justification
[1:05:26] like you've not done
[1:05:30] it that's the way God works he keeps
[1:05:33] crossing his
[1:05:35] borders so by looking at
[1:05:38] God busting these borders
[1:05:42] here we should not
[1:05:45] also maintain
[1:05:47] ourselves into ideological
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:53] boxes and you are stuck there
[1:05:58] now I said God forgive
[1:06:01] me and he ji me now I have done
[1:06:06] this and I've left justification
[1:06:10] behind God moves with all this
[1:06:14] dispensation
[1:06:16] with hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:06:20] Amen you've got a right to take yourself
[1:06:24] before God
[1:06:26] in the blood of Jesus and leave us
[1:06:30] clean that's the first day you mention
[1:06:32] your
[1:06:34] Sal that's the way God works and that's
[1:06:38] the only reason
[1:06:39] why you shall be without spot
[1:06:44] or so I want us to keep that aside now
[1:06:50] and go back to
[1:06:52] Genesis 1 verse 5
[1:06:57] in
[1:06:59] genesis5 and
[1:07:01] God called the day I mean the light
[1:07:06] day and the Darkness he called
[1:07:10] night and the
[1:07:12] evening and the morning were the first
[1:07:21] day now according to you
[1:07:26] your day started in the
[1:07:29] morning isn't it
[1:07:31] so that's the way you
[1:07:34] think but the Hebrew
[1:07:37] day begins with
[1:07:42] evening are you together with me like
[1:07:45] you went to bed on
[1:07:50] Sunday it doesn't begin at midnight
[1:07:55] it begin
[1:07:58] 6:00
[1:08:00] yesterday among the
[1:08:02] Hebrew
[1:08:03] m is beginning 6:00
[1:08:08] today in the evening that's the Bible
[1:08:12] counting of
[1:08:13] days so the Hebrew day begins with the
[1:08:17] evening and then runs into the breaking
[1:08:21] of dawn
[1:08:26] am and then it goes through the
[1:08:31] daylight and then end in the
[1:08:36] evening and the
[1:08:39] evening and the morning was the first
[1:08:43] day so this is the way God works in
[1:08:49] creation Now I want you to notice one
[1:08:53] thing
[1:08:54] here that the day of
[1:08:57] God begins with
[1:09:01] darkness and then it breaks into
[1:09:06] life amen that's the way he worked with
[1:09:11] creation he began in
[1:09:14] darkness to bring it into
[1:09:18] light amen God wouldn't begin in
[1:09:23] light and then end up
[1:09:27] no that would
[1:09:29] be God begins with
[1:09:32] you in the
[1:09:34] evening and the morning is the first
[1:09:38] day are you together with me so God
[1:09:41] begins with his
[1:09:44] creation like he says in Genesis chapter
[1:09:48] 1 he says in the beginning God created
[1:09:52] the heavens and the Earth
[1:09:55] and the Earth was without
[1:09:58] form amen and void and darkness was upon
[1:10:03] the first of the
[1:10:05] deep and the spirit of God was moving
[1:10:09] upon the face of the
[1:10:11] waters are you together with me is
[1:10:15] beginning in the
[1:10:17] creation he begins with
[1:10:20] Darkness some of you condemn
[1:10:23] yourselves because you come with a lot
[1:10:27] of your
[1:10:28] past it is so heav on you but I want you
[1:10:33] to know that God in creation is started
[1:10:39] with a
[1:10:40] void with the darkness but the spirit of
[1:10:44] God was moving upon the face of
[1:10:49] the are you together with me amen you
[1:10:53] may look what you look like today
[1:10:57] and you may be hating what you look
[1:11:00] like but I want you to
[1:11:03] realize that the spirit of God is
[1:11:06] hovering over
[1:11:08] you he's waiting for a
[1:11:11] spot where is going to say let
[1:11:17] be are you together with me yes that's
[1:11:21] the way God
[1:11:22] works Amen in the evening and the
[1:11:27] morning was the first day God is working
[1:11:31] on you praise God Amen he begins with
[1:11:35] his creation from
[1:11:39] Darkness a world without
[1:11:41] form a world void of
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:45] substance and darkness was upon the face
[1:11:48] of the
[1:11:51] de amen but the spirit of God was moving
[1:11:55] upon the face of the
[1:11:57] waters you may not feel his presence but
[1:12:01] I want tell you the spirit of God is
[1:12:04] moving upon your
[1:12:07] Waters amen praise God contining the
[1:12:13] church Contin the
[1:12:16] church the
[1:12:18] stud praying it doesn't matter how you
[1:12:23] feel you are
[1:12:26] just
[1:12:27] continue and one time you are going to
[1:12:30] break into a
[1:12:32] circuit where the voice of God will
[1:12:35] say Let There
[1:12:39] Be praise God yeah that's the way God
[1:12:43] works so looking at the
[1:12:46] Earth one would not see any form of
[1:12:50] election upon it
[1:12:55] because it was
[1:12:56] void it was
[1:12:58] dark you look upon it and you said does
[1:13:02] an elect look like
[1:13:07] that hallelujah hallelujah God begins in
[1:13:11] the
[1:13:12] evening and it finishes with us in the
[1:13:16] morning amen there will be
[1:13:19] life in the evening
[1:13:22] time hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:13:25] God Amen there was no recognizable
[1:13:29] Beauty on the
[1:13:31] Earth but the
[1:13:33] beauty was hidden in the Gloom of
[1:13:38] Darkness it was there the seeds were
[1:13:42] predestinated and they were placed under
[1:13:44] the

[1:13:52] life that's the way we all start

[1:13:57] Darkness there's no pride in your
[1:14:01] history amen you've been so wicked
[1:14:05] you've been through things you don't
[1:14:07] even want to talk
[1:14:09] about every one of us has a negative
[1:14:14] history amen it is just like a soul he
[1:14:19] was a violent
[1:14:21] persecutor he killed men and led men to
[1:14:24] prison
[1:14:27] was
[1:14:32] a but the
[1:14:34] evening and the morning was the first
[1:14:40] day we are coming let's go to Ephesians
[1:14:44] 2
[1:14:46] verse1 he
[1:14:48] says and
[1:14:51] you Paul is talking to
[1:14:53] you has
[1:14:56] quickened who were dead in trespass and
[1:15:01] sins that was your
[1:15:04] evening where in time
[1:15:12] PSE Amen in the time pass you walked
[1:15:16] according to the course of this
[1:15:20] world now you were not this world
[1:15:26] but you walked according to the
[1:15:31] cause but you an
[1:15:34] elect under a wicked

[1:15:41] evening you had the
[1:15:43] darkness you
[1:15:46] blind are you together with me amen
[1:15:50] according to the priest of the power of
[1:15:52] the air

[1:16:03] evil as evil could
[1:16:06] be our
[1:16:08] past is not you know
[1:16:12] praiseworthy it's so dark and no

[1:16:49] form a quickening from

[1:17:02] is no
[1:17:03] joy that we can point
[1:17:05] to in the beginning of our
[1:17:09] journey there's no joy but grace started
[1:17:14] the work of
[1:17:17] Separation hallelujah
[1:17:20] hallelujah in Eden
[1:17:25] praise God grace started the work of
[1:17:29] Separation there was aned
[1:17:33] there full of
[1:17:35] beauty but it was in the
[1:17:41] evening and God came out with the gospel
[1:17:45] of
[1:17:48] Separation praise the Lord amen
[1:17:51] separating this from that separating
[1:17:56] this from the state of
[1:18:00] sanctification separation of

[1:18:08] firmament in the midst of the
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:12] waters and let it divide the waters from
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:17] waters it was separation upon
[1:18:21] separation the same way God is
[1:18:24] continuing
[1:18:25] to separate you from
[1:18:28] things that are
[1:18:30] ugly to reveal the
[1:18:33] beauty which God created on the ins side
[1:18:37] of Hallelujah every one of us has got a
[1:18:42] beautiful spot in

[1:18:50] under the
[1:18:52] heaven be gathered together

[1:19:04] the
[1:19:05] separation the word the word praise God

[1:23:01] Corinth Grew From
[1:23:03] Darkness to
[1:23:07] light are you together with me that's
[1:23:11] how the church
[1:23:13] grows maybe let me go down
[1:23:16] here to the book of First Corinthians
[1:23:24] see I don't know whether you really see
[1:23:27] what I'm talking
[1:23:29] about the
[1:23:31] evening and the
[1:23:36] morning your
[1:23:38] day as a
[1:23:40] gentile would start in the
[1:23:43] morning I wouldn't like a day which ends
[1:23:47] in
[1:23:50] darkness I want a day which begins in
[1:23:55] darkness and winds up in the
[1:24:00] morning that's the
[1:24:02] creation that's the Bible
[1:24:05] day now here Paul
[1:24:08] says Paul
[1:24:11] called to be an apostle of Jesus
[1:24:17] Christ through the will of
[1:24:19] God and sness our brother
[1:24:25] unto the Church of
[1:24:27] God which is
[1:24:30] at to them that are Sanctified in
[1:24:34] Christ and called to be
[1:24:40] Saint
[1:24:42] Sanctified called to be
[1:24:46] saints that I know where you are you are
[1:24:50] in the
[1:24:51] mud you are in the dirt
[1:24:54] but you are
[1:24:56] called to be
[1:24:59] Sanctified and be a
[1:25:03] saint that's the Church of
[1:25:05] Corinth it was in
[1:25:08] darkness but they were called to be you
[1:25:12] know
[1:25:13] saintes they grew from
[1:25:16] Darkness to light they
[1:25:19] separated you know the you separate
[1:25:23] themselves among men
[1:25:26] lines amen I am
[1:25:29] of I am
[1:25:31] of I am of
[1:25:33] apoll because every man is made in a
[1:25:37] certain way there are some people who
[1:25:41] love
[1:25:43] eloquence
[1:25:52] eloquence and then there are some people
[1:25:55] who like others were
[1:26:00] slow and so these
[1:26:09] people the other
[1:26:11] one like
[1:26:13] Apollos very smart
[1:26:15] man and then there are some who was
[1:26:22] systematic of
[1:26:27] so they were divided along men
[1:26:31] lives exulting human
[1:26:34] wisdom and Paul called
[1:26:38] them the Bible says they lived in ad
[1:26:42] doubt they
[1:26:44] drank they
[1:26:45] drun and they ate things sacrific to
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:51] Idol but the ministry of Paul
[1:26:55] helped them into
[1:26:58] separation to grow into anen of
[1:27:02] Beauty with great Revelations given to
[1:27:08] them are you together with me yeah when
[1:27:12] brother Bram was talking about the
[1:27:14] Church of
[1:27:16] Corinth he said
[1:27:19] cor a church of
[1:27:21] Correction everything
[1:27:25] wrong was among those people but they
[1:27:28] started in the
[1:27:31] darkness ending the
[1:27:33] light with great Revelations which were
[1:27:36] given to
[1:27:38] them is the only
[1:27:40] church that could speak to about
[1:27:48] theop amen saying that there is a body
[1:27:51] waiting up
[1:27:54] they are the only
[1:27:56] church that Paul could talk to about the
[1:28:01] order of the
[1:28:03] Resurrection is the only church that
[1:28:06] Paul could and tell them how he went
[1:28:11] beyond the
[1:28:13] heavens they had mature from
[1:28:22] Darkness amen
[1:28:25] so it all begins with
[1:28:28] evening when there is some
[1:28:32] light are you together with me the
[1:28:35] evening and the
[1:28:38] morning and remember the evening has
[1:28:42] some element of
[1:28:48] light are you together with me it all
[1:28:52] begins
[1:28:54] in the evening when there is some
[1:28:58] light and then breaks into
[1:29:04] day amen just like
[1:29:08] a your evening was
[1:29:12] darkish and
[1:29:14] ugly but see where God has brought you
[1:29:18] to I can say it's the rising of the Sun
[1:29:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:29:26] start saying
[1:29:28] oh it's the rising of the sun you rush
[1:29:33] out you wash your face you begin to walk
[1:29:40] in are you together with
[1:29:43] me so the coming forth of the
[1:29:47] sun announces a new
[1:29:51] day meaning
[1:29:54] the evening lights are gone
[1:29:59] past and the Seven Watchers are going
[1:30:04] past they are what they call seven
[1:30:06] watches in the Bible so we shall see
[1:30:09] what they
[1:30:10] are and the
[1:30:13] sleeping is also
[1:30:15] over and it's
[1:30:18] time to
[1:30:20] live in the light
[1:30:25] okay now pull back your
[1:30:30] understanding pull back your
[1:30:33] understanding amen about crossing the
[1:30:36] dispensational
[1:30:39] borders because we shall need
[1:30:42] them I want to take this Matthew
[1:30:47] 25 from verse
[1:30:49] one to
[1:30:52] six and I show you something
[1:30:55] here the scripture
[1:30:58] says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:31:02] likened 10
[1:31:08] virgins now many times when we talk
[1:31:12] about the 10
[1:31:14] virgins the people normally see the 10
[1:31:19] virgins in the final age
[1:31:25] but I want tell you that every
[1:31:29] age has had its 10
[1:31:36] V
[1:31:37] okay which took their lamps and went
[1:31:40] forth to meet the
[1:31:45] bridegroom and five of them were
[1:31:49] wives and five were
[1:31:51] foolish and they that were fool took
[1:31:54] their
[1:31:56] lamps and took no oil with
[1:31:59] them but the
[1:32:02] wi hallelujah hallelujah they take the
[1:32:06] oil where do they get the oil
[1:32:09] from Hallelujah from the word right now
[1:32:14] you are taking the
[1:32:16] oil amen be
[1:32:19] wise and take the oil don't come to
[1:32:23] church
[1:32:24] and walk back
[1:32:26] empty don't listen to a tape and walk
[1:32:30] back empty each time you come to the
[1:32:33] presence of the Lord some
[1:32:36] oil you need it for the
[1:32:39] journey amen but the wise took oil in
[1:32:44] their vessels with their
[1:32:48] lands while the bridegroom
[1:32:52] T they all SL stumbled and
[1:32:56] slept and at
[1:32:58] midnight there was a cry
[1:33:01] made the bridegroom
[1:33:04] comes going out to Mee
[1:33:08] him
[1:33:09] now prophetically
[1:33:13] speaking brother Bram speaks about the
[1:33:16] seven
[1:33:19] Watchers amen as the seven Church ages
[1:33:26] where the Saints kept
[1:33:30] sleeping waiting for the coming of the
[1:33:33] Lord because we live in the de
[1:33:37] today that ises the
[1:33:41] resurrection they waited in
[1:33:44] Ephesus they all

[1:34:19] edges the wise ones slept with their oil
[1:34:24] hallelujah hallelujah they slept with
[1:34:27] their
[1:34:28] oil so when they wake up in the
[1:34:31] resurrection to Tri their
[1:34:34] LS they will be together with us as we
[1:34:38] also trim our
[1:34:40] LS hallelujah hallelujah we shall see

[1:34:47] 30 40
[1:34:50] days as I've always preached here amen
[1:34:55] so they wake up to trim their
[1:34:58] LS and we
[1:35:00] also that will have our
[1:35:03] wisdom who have been taking the oil we
[1:35:07] shall be triming our
[1:35:10] L amen much as we shall at that
[1:35:15] time teach them
[1:35:18] nothing they too they teach us nothing
[1:35:24] they all went with enough
[1:35:27] oil to bring forth their
[1:35:31] Resurrection as we too have been
[1:35:35] building enough oil to see our
[1:35:41] Rapture hallelujah hallelujah they
[1:35:44] needed the oil of
[1:35:46] Moses amen the resurrection of the Dead
[1:35:50] we needed the oil of
[1:35:52] elishah those who are changed while we
[1:35:55] still
[1:35:58] live now listen to what brother Bram
[1:36:02] says he says here in the message who do
[1:36:05] you say this
[1:36:07] is but you see the bride is not going to
[1:36:12] be made
[1:36:14] up of just what little group is here on
[1:36:18] Earth
[1:36:22] now when the seventh
[1:36:25] watch when he
[1:36:27] come all those
[1:36:31] virgins raised to trim their
[1:36:34] L hallelujah
[1:36:37] hallelujah when he comes all those of
[1:36:43] Ephesus P the wise ones will wake up
[1:36:47] with
[1:36:48] their they went with them hallelujah
[1:36:52] hallelujah and wise virgins on this
[1:36:55] hour oh praise the Lord they also
[1:36:59] pumping enough
[1:37:03] oil praise the Lord that's why if you
[1:37:07] are going to
[1:37:09] sleep without seeing the
[1:37:11] Lord you need to have enough
[1:37:17] oil amen so he says when the seventh
[1:37:22] watch
[1:37:24] when he came all those virgins raised
[1:37:27] and trimmed their
[1:37:29] Liv all the way back everyone that
[1:37:33] believed the anointed
[1:37:36] word down through the edge come forth
[1:37:40] like a
[1:37:41] pyamid and comeon but the
[1:37:46] headstone had to come to pick the whole
[1:37:49] thing
[1:37:51] up to make a pyramid
[1:37:54] now the bride will be made up of all
[1:37:58] those Through the
[1:38:02] Ages that's believe and has accepted
[1:38:05] Christ as their
[1:38:10] savior are you together with me so all
[1:38:13] the way
[1:38:14] back everyone that believed the anointed
[1:38:19] work of their days Through the Ages
[1:38:24] they come
[1:38:26] forth so what we call the sleeping
[1:38:31] virgins is not those of this age
[1:38:36] only MTH
[1:38:38] 25 is playing out
[1:38:43] again in this
[1:38:45] age it has been alive in every
[1:38:50] age and every age had a qualified
[1:38:55] group that had their
[1:38:58] oil and they
[1:39:01] waiting they are not
[1:39:03] dead they are
[1:39:06] waiting hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:39:08] according to the pr of the
[1:39:12] church going through the seven
[1:39:16] watches Pentecost
[1:39:19] P hallelujah
[1:39:22] hallelujah I mean the
[1:39:26] Pentecost was not the full
[1:39:31] light I want you to know
[1:39:34] that because the
[1:39:37] church had to degenerate into
[1:39:43] watches
[1:39:45] amen praise the Lord of
[1:39:49] Darkness Pentecost was a Twilight
[1:39:57] the day of
[1:39:58] pentec was
[1:40:01] Twilight amen enough
[1:40:04] light to S the
[1:40:06] seed but along the way the darkness of
[1:40:10] the
[1:40:11] night the church slept
[1:40:17] again praise the Lord so let me show you
[1:40:21] something here that the Feast of
[1:40:25] Pentecost was not
[1:40:29] perfect because when you go to the
[1:40:33] feast is only the Feast of
[1:40:37] Pentecost that had
[1:40:40] loes
[1:40:42] loes that had in
[1:40:48] them are you together with me yeah it
[1:40:52] had Liv
[1:40:56] and that bread was not
[1:40:59] holy until it was wed together with the
[1:41:04] sacrifice so the coming down of the Holy
[1:41:08] Ghost was not coming upon a perfect
[1:41:12] Church hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:41:15] Holiness of those
[1:41:17] people on the day of Pentecost was the
[1:41:20] blood of the sacrifice
[1:41:25] it was not a perfect
[1:41:27] light it was the
[1:41:30] evening and the
[1:41:34] morning was one
[1:41:36] day so the
[1:41:39] church goes through the
[1:41:42] night and the night has seven
[1:41:46] watches amen praise the Lord because
[1:41:50] this
[1:41:52] watches is it's like those
[1:41:58] Watchmen amen they would watch up to
[1:42:01] this distance of
[1:42:03] time and then those ones go then another
[1:42:07] Bunch
[1:42:08] comes then watches they also finish and
[1:42:12] go so the night would have seven
[1:42:17] watches so those are seven watches
[1:42:24] those are what we are calling
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:33] watches so I think you understand what I
[1:42:35] mean so
[1:42:37] Ephesus was
[1:42:47] a amen and that one goes
[1:42:53] becomes a
[1:42:57] watch are you
[1:43:01] understanding you don't understand come
[1:43:04] back so the Feast of
[1:43:08] pente was the Holy
[1:43:10] Ghost coming Upon A people that had
[1:43:15] Liv so it was not perfect
[1:43:19] light it was
[1:43:22] Twilight of the evening
[1:43:25] time because Pentecost without
[1:43:29] Paul was not
[1:43:32] complete amen Paul is the one who had
[1:43:36] the perfect
[1:43:38] Revelation he was not there in the upper
[1:43:42] room Amen to introduce the message of
[1:43:47] Grace Amen to draw in the
[1:43:50] Gentiles to bring back the tabac of
[1:43:54] David that not dividing
[1:43:59] segments to let the foundation of the
[1:44:01] Everlasting
[1:44:04] gospel so let me tell you this
[1:44:08] Pentecost was an
[1:44:14] evening it was the
[1:44:18] beginning of the day the day that begins
[1:44:22] in the evening
[1:44:24] the beginning of another day better to
[1:44:27] go through seven
[1:44:30] watches and we thank God we are in the
[1:44:34] morning of that
[1:44:38] day
[1:44:40] amen so listen now so the same
[1:44:45] anointing that g the church and that
[1:44:48] gave birth to the
[1:44:50] church at Pentecost
[1:44:53] came back again among
[1:44:56] us by the ministry of Malachi
[1:44:59] 4 to
[1:45:08] bring you to go and stud it over again I
[1:45:11] want you
[1:45:14] to so I want you to hear Brother Bram
[1:45:18] here calling his message another
[1:45:21] Ephesian
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:29] and now much
[1:45:31] more in Paradox of
[1:45:33] Phoenix Pho and now much more has he
[1:45:40] promised
[1:45:41] now because let me say
[1:45:45] this God give me
[1:45:49] Grace Pentecost P was a morning
[1:45:53] I me was
[1:45:55] evening with
[1:46:01] Twilight and then it has gone through
[1:46:03] the seven watches of the
[1:46:08] night and then it breaks into
[1:46:12] light in our day that's why Mal comes up
[1:46:19] and says it is the rising of the Sun
[1:46:24] it's the
[1:46:26] morning we are going it another
[1:46:29] day and this day here is the eth
[1:46:34] day so we are stepping into
[1:46:38] eternity that's where the next fruit is
[1:46:41] going to
[1:46:45] be but yet at the same
[1:46:48] time when we go back to the principal
[1:46:52] of Matthew chapter
[1:46:55] 25 every Church
[1:46:58] age has had its own time to acquire the
[1:47:10] oil every age the word came to them they
[1:47:15] received it they took the
[1:47:18] oil that was the
[1:47:21] Ephesus when the the Holy Spirit
[1:47:24] came
[1:47:26] now God Crossing his own
[1:47:29] borders even to this age he has
[1:47:34] brought
[1:47:35] another
[1:47:37] Ephesian the same power the same Grace
[1:47:42] that came is back here with
[1:47:47] us that's why brother Bram
[1:47:50] says how much more has he
[1:47:55] promised how much more is it living in
[1:47:59] the
[1:48:01] Bible to this very age that we are
[1:48:06] living the Ephesians
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:11] again of the church
[1:48:13] ages we got seven Church
[1:48:16] ages and we promise at L Church 8
[1:48:22] there would
[1:48:24] be
[1:48:29] another hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:33] again so we have an
[1:48:36] evening and a
[1:48:38] morning in the evening
[1:48:41] time are you together with me like it
[1:48:45] was
[1:48:47] started in the evening on the Pentacles
[1:48:52] it comes the
[1:48:53] opening which is the rising of the
[1:48:56] Sun but God has given the
[1:49:02] chur play back of the same thing
[1:49:08] again that he has given
[1:49:10] us space to plant
[1:49:14] seeds of restoration of the
[1:49:20] Gospel amen amen
[1:49:23] he says we got seven Church
[1:49:27] ages and we have promised that at the
[1:49:29] Lan Church
[1:49:31] age there would
[1:49:33] be
[1:49:35] another that's right and we are here I
[1:49:40] believe with all my heart that Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ who has made the
[1:49:46] promise so his
[1:49:48] message the message of Malachi 4
[1:49:53] was evening
[1:49:56] light meaning that it was the beginning
[1:49:59] of a new
[1:50:02] day
[1:50:04] evening
[1:50:06] evening and the
[1:50:08] morning was a day so the replanting of
[1:50:11] the
[1:50:13] seeds that had been lost in the church
[1:50:17] ages the Min of
[1:50:22] are you together with
[1:50:24] me there is something I want to break
[1:50:28] and I want you to catch
[1:50:29] it in the end time
[1:50:32] evangelism the prophet says the end time
[1:50:36] evangelist
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:42] message is from Malachi
[1:50:46] 4 it is a
[1:50:51] restoring of of all the seeds that had
[1:50:54] been lost through the
[1:50:56] edges the message and
[1:51:01] messenger we both have to be a
[1:51:04] restoration of the
[1:51:09] faith amen Jude
[1:51:12] said just about 30 years after the
[1:51:18] crucifixion Breen I give all diligence
[1:51:21] right unto you
[1:51:24] of the common
[1:51:26] salvation that should honestly content
[1:51:29] for the
[1:51:30] faith that was delivered to the Saints
[1:51:33] back
[1:51:35] there Malachi said for the last days the
[1:51:40] last prophet of the Old
[1:51:44] Testament that before the great and
[1:51:47] terrible day of the Lord shall
[1:51:50] come I send you a
[1:51:53] the and he will restore the
[1:51:56] Fai of the children
[1:51:59] back all the faith of the children back
[1:52:02] to the
[1:52:04] fathers just before the
[1:52:10] destruction
[1:52:13] another
[1:52:15] first in the day of
[1:52:18] Pentecost the Holy Spirit came gave
[1:52:21] seeds
[1:52:24] and the seeds were
[1:52:26] lost through the dark watches of the
[1:52:30] night but through those
[1:52:33] ages the Saints have been
[1:52:36] sleeping sleeping sleeping the wise ones
[1:52:41] going with their
[1:52:43] oil now the
[1:52:46] challenge is what they
[1:52:49] lost malach is bringing back
[1:52:55] are you together with me so we have to
[1:52:58] receive the entire
[1:53:00] world the fullness of the
[1:53:03] world as it has been given to
[1:53:07] us and it's from that
[1:53:10] message of
[1:53:12] Mal that the wise virgin shall be
[1:53:19] found we don't expect a wise virgin
[1:53:23] going along with the message of
[1:53:26] Luther Wesley amen Pentecost it come out
[1:53:31] of all my
[1:53:33] people and come to the last
[1:53:36] day of the feast so the message of
[1:53:40] Malachi 4 given to
[1:53:43] us is another
[1:53:47] evening which is opening up to
[1:53:50] morning another day
[1:53:53] this is another Covenant all
[1:53:57] together amen and this message has come
[1:54:01] through
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] Frost and
[1:54:06] frog and kinds of
[1:54:10] interpretations the message which has
[1:54:12] been
[1:54:13] sown but we thank
[1:54:16] God that there will be people that are
[1:54:20] going to hold this message t
[1:54:26] they're going to hold to
[1:54:27] it because it's
[1:54:33] life
[1:54:35] listen in modern events made clear by
[1:54:42] prophecy
[1:54:44] listen he says they had six
[1:54:48] miles miles
[1:54:53] it seemed a very short
[1:54:55] time I
[1:54:57] suppose and they had 6
[1:55:03] hoursmon on Vindicated
[1:55:06] prophecy it was now getting kind of late
[1:55:10] in the evening
[1:55:12] time the evening lights had
[1:55:18] come it's the same time now
[1:55:23] the evening lights has
[1:55:29] come are you together with me Mal
[1:55:34] message is calling it evening
[1:55:39] lights as it's given to
[1:55:42] us restor to
[1:55:44] us the
[1:55:46] evening and the
[1:55:48] morning another day so Mal for
[1:55:53] is another evening
[1:55:59] life so he brings us a
[1:56:02] message which finds US
[1:56:05] void and dark and
[1:56:09] Confused calls us out of
[1:56:11] Pentecost blesses us into the message
[1:56:14] it's by this message that we can be able
[1:56:18] to talk about the oil
[1:56:24] amen
[1:56:25] amen is the same yesterday today and
[1:56:29] forever oh events made clear by
[1:56:36] prophecy evening
[1:56:39] light has promised by the prophet of
[1:56:43] God
[1:56:45] inarah
[1:56:47] 147 May a gate open the true believer's
[1:56:50] eyes
[1:56:53] to the lights that's taking place
[1:56:56] today he said the evening
[1:57:00] light has
[1:57:04] come Pentecost P was the
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:12] evening and the
[1:57:15] morning is the end of the
[1:57:19] ages but here in the loud
[1:57:24] church he brings another
[1:57:27] Ephesian to bring all the
[1:57:30] seeds that had been lost Through the
[1:57:33] Ages gives them to
[1:57:35] Mal to plant them to us those are the
[1:57:39] things that are giving the wise virgin
[1:57:49] oil praise the Lord but to the to
[1:57:54] understand the evening
[1:57:56] lights we must remember
[1:58:00] genesis5 and the evening and the morning
[1:58:02] were new
[1:58:04] day let's go to
[1:58:06] Zechariah chter 14
[1:58:09] verse amen I want you to go back and
[1:58:14] listen through this
[1:58:16] message it's very very
[1:58:20] important amen amen
[1:58:23] Zechariah
[1:58:26] 147 he says but it shall be one
[1:58:32] day which shall be known to the
[1:58:37] Lord not day nor
[1:58:41] night but it shall come to
[1:58:44] pass that at the evening
[1:58:48] time it shall be light
[1:58:53] this is the day of the
[1:58:56] message not day not
[1:58:59] night so always the
[1:59:02] evening has some little bit of light in
[1:59:06] it and so the day of the coming forth of
[1:59:12] the message of Mal
[1:59:16] 4en is that kind of day
[1:59:22] with enough
[1:59:23] light to bring back all the L seed of
[1:59:27] the
[1:59:28] world you hear what he
[1:59:30] says in the message trying to do God a
[1:59:34] service the evening
[1:59:37] time he promised he would
[1:59:42] reveal open these Seven
[1:59:46] Seals and show what them churches had
[1:59:48] missed back there
[1:59:54] at the evening
[1:59:57] time you see in the evening
[2:00:00] time in thean church
[2:00:03] age it will be
[2:00:06] both the evening and the
[2:00:13] morning that's the way God is
[2:00:17] working so there is to be an evening
[2:00:19] time message
[2:00:22] and receive the same thing that they did
[2:00:24] at the
[2:00:26] beginning that's brother Bram saying the
[2:00:30] evening time message is rest back again
[2:00:34] to bring back that same thing so the
[2:00:37] evening time was when this message came
[2:00:40] to us in the opening of The Seven
[2:00:45] SE that's the
[2:00:50] evening we are wai for the
[2:00:53] morning I meet you in the
[2:00:58] morning How can there be a
[2:01:01] morning before there was an
[2:01:04] evening how can we the rising of the
[2:01:07] sun there has not be night so the
[2:01:11] receiving of this
[2:01:13] message is your
[2:01:15] evening but you go through your
[2:01:18] watches through your watches
[2:01:22] and this time
[2:01:24] here all the
[2:01:26] virgins will be in
[2:01:31] time you can look at them through the
[2:01:35] edges as they slept the wise
[2:01:42] and but at this age they rise up to meet
[2:01:47] you and the foolish Virgin of this age
[2:01:51] will be the one crying give us some of
[2:01:55] your
[2:01:57] of
[2:01:59] of but the others will be out streaming
[2:02:03] the lamps with
[2:02:06] us amen so it shall be
[2:02:10] light about the evening time the path to
[2:02:15] Glory you shall surely
[2:02:18] find if you are
[2:02:20] elected amen
[2:02:22] and then we have had the repeat as I
[2:02:26] said ofth
[2:02:29] 25 starts again to catch the bride at
[2:02:32] the end
[2:02:34] time at the opening of the seventh
[2:02:38] seal amen so I want to say something
[2:02:42] here that it
[2:02:44] releases
[2:02:46] only not knowledge
[2:02:50] only but it reles
[2:02:53] oil this
[2:02:55] Revelation as you receive the
[2:02:59] understanding it keeps opening the
[2:03:02] top of the
[2:03:04] oil for your
[2:03:08] l so let's talk about the seven watches
[2:03:11] a
[2:03:14] bit let me say
[2:03:16] this there cannot be an
[2:03:20] evening with without seven
[2:03:24] watches that happened
[2:03:27] through a
[2:03:30] night okay
[2:03:33] prophetically every Church age in
[2:03:37] itself was a
[2:03:41] watch
[2:03:43] amen but
[2:03:45] still these seven
[2:03:48] watches repeat
[2:03:51] the seventh Church age of
[2:03:55] L so day
[2:03:59] again has to
[2:04:01] begin as I've already told you in this
[2:04:05] age
[2:04:10] of with Twilight in the evening
[2:04:14] time releasing the message of the hour
[2:04:16] to
[2:04:20] you restoring the baptism in Jesus name
[2:04:24] restoring the
[2:04:26] godhead restoring the understanding of
[2:04:29] the
[2:04:31] sereny restoring the understanding of
[2:04:33] the Bride
[2:04:35] tree so many things are going to be
[2:04:38] BR the position of the woman in the
[2:04:42] church praise the Lord so this day of
[2:04:44] the seventh Church
[2:04:46] AG amen has also to go through seven
[2:04:50] watches
[2:04:54] but in the seventh
[2:04:58] watch The
[2:05:00] Virgins are called into the
[2:05:04] bridge so they could
[2:05:07] shine as morning
[2:05:12] Stars that's when the Ed is
[2:05:16] closing there will be
[2:05:19] people that have got their oil
[2:05:23] they'll be given an
[2:05:25] opportunity to
[2:05:27] shine as morning
[2:05:32] Stars that's what we are talking about
[2:05:34] cing our
[2:05:37] lamps that our lamps may be
[2:05:41] made
[2:05:43] bright and you shine in the place of
[2:05:47] work wherever we
[2:05:49] go God
[2:05:51] looking for those lamps that to fill
[2:05:55] with
[2:05:59] oil listen what brother Bram
[2:06:02] say coming down through the
[2:06:06] watches there would be seven
[2:06:08] watches and in the seventh watch The
[2:06:12] Midnight
[2:06:15] Hour we are striking
[2:06:18] now now in this midnight watch
[2:06:22] these virgins
[2:06:25] walk and trimmed their
[2:06:28] LS and
[2:06:32] went it's your
[2:06:36] time the church is not raptured in the
[2:06:41] evening it's raptured in the
[2:06:44] morning are you together with
[2:06:47] me the
[2:06:49] message is given in the evening
[2:06:52] the
[2:06:53] Rapture comes in your morning when the
[2:06:56] message comes in the evening in the
[2:07:01] Twilight in the evening it shall be
[2:07:04] light it go through the frost of the
[2:07:10] night this
[2:07:14] interpretation these ones which just
[2:07:16] want to jump around and
[2:07:18] run those ones which want they go
[2:07:20] through all those
[2:07:23] but finally there will be a morning
[2:07:28] St that will
[2:07:31] sh that is
[2:07:36] you praise the Lord so the day must
[2:07:40] break from evening
[2:07:44] lights to morning
[2:07:46] lights for the morning stars to
[2:07:50] shine that evening
[2:07:53] lights were teaching
[2:07:56] lights but the morning
[2:07:58] lights manifestation
[2:08:01] Lights of the Life of Christ
[2:08:05] himself in his
[2:08:08] people so let me talk about the morning
[2:08:12] Stars before I
[2:08:17] close you
[2:08:19] know the only chance
[2:08:23] that a star
[2:08:25] get to
[2:08:27] shine is if there's
[2:08:31] Darkness the stars are there in the sky
[2:08:35] now but who can see
[2:08:38] them
[2:08:41] nobody but when the darkness
[2:08:44] comes and covers the
[2:08:47] earth then the Stars will have the
[2:08:51] opportunity
[2:08:54] are you together with me you are going
[2:08:56] to have your opportunity to
[2:08:58] shine hallelujah hallelujah when the
[2:09:02] women are putting on short time you get
[2:09:07] your opportunity to sh when they are
[2:09:10] trying to breach
[2:09:12] their you are going to get your
[2:09:15] opportunity to
[2:09:17] shine so the world must become so dark
[2:09:22] with all form of Darkness with all form
[2:09:25] of evil so that you with the little
[2:09:29] light you still be able to
[2:09:32] sh amen you are morning
[2:09:36] Stars oh hallelujah hallelujah praise
[2:09:39] God how could we get the opportunity to
[2:09:42] shine Our
[2:09:45] Stars if God didn't allow the darkness
[2:09:49] now
[2:09:53] because the message is given in the
[2:09:55] evening
[2:09:57] light when there are some
[2:10:00] Twilight but then it gets dark across to
[2:10:03] the
[2:10:04] midnight and after midnight when we are
[2:10:08] broken
[2:10:09] door that's when the bright
[2:10:13] sty begin to come
[2:10:16] forth new day

[2:10:27] let your light shine in the dark
[2:10:30] places where it's really
[2:10:33] needed that's brother Bram saying out in
[2:10:37] the
[2:10:37] hedges and in the
[2:10:40] highways in the
