Pastor went to preach to in brother G's church so just keep him in your prayers praise the name of the Lord we also want to appreciate those who came for yesterday's praying and fasting meeting and we just keep on coming into the to participate into the services of the Lord praise the name of our Lord then on 28th that will be next this the Friday after the coming weekend 29th rather 28th of this month we shall be having an overnight service here praise the name of our Lord then on 30th of June that is two Sundays from now we shall be hosting brother Andreas he'll be coming to take us in services and then we shall be expecting a number of ministers coming to join us in that service and so I still call upon your participation your contribution that we may have meetings which will go on well today we have a youth meeting after the morning service praise the name of the Lord request the youth to stay back after the morning service praise the name of the Lord so I have here a testimony from brother brother Dan and gra M he says God bless you Saints i and m Queen We want to thank God for his love and protection upon us we are so grateful to the Lord that he has blessed us with a baby girl amen we also want to thank God for you brethren for standing with us in all things that we went through Pastor family brother our precious Aunt Margaret Aunt marget momy Rose and the entire church for standing with us prayerfully with encouragement and advice may God richly bless you for loving us it was your efforts that the Lord delivered us from the hospitals and we are doing well by God's grace from the time we were discharged and continue praying for us for more grace Upon Our Little Princess God bless you from the family of brother and sister M Grace we request to dedicate our baby in the hands of God for his protection upon her life good health may God's life be manifested in her life all through amen pra the name of our Lord last month and this month there have been month of people giving birth praise the name of Lord even our brother Elijah and Soph they had the baby in the of the week and then before that we had the brother o Moses and his wife also they had they had the baby and I believe another person also did the same praise the name of the Lord I remember I think it was around last year it was the month of August and we had too many weddings around so we are thankful to God praise the name of our Lord for the grace that he has given our Brethren let us sing bring them in as they bring the [Music] little bring them bring them [Music] down of [Music] hallelujah oh yes [Music] bring bringing ones to [Music] Jes bring them in bring Hallelujah bring [Music] bring from [Music] the [Music] bring bring bring wondering [Music] to amen praise the name of our Lord just remember when we had the meetings on 2nd of June and then sister Grace came and sang before that she was very strong little didn't you know that the following day she was going to give so we thank God for the strength he gave her you know before last year she got an accident a terrible accident until they put a lot of metals in her body but we thank God that gave her the grace give birth and then another thing you know sometimes here people have a culture their own tradition when they about to give birth they stop coming to church but we thank God she didn't stop coming to church praise the name of the Lord and now when they give birth they take one month without coming toch but last Sunday they were in hospital and this morning I was wondering are they coming to church and then here she has come to church the name so we need to change those birad tradition giving birth should not be an next for you to be away from church praise the name of our Lord mothers can we say amen amen let it be like that I want to appreciate for your dedication praise the name of the Lord so in Matthew chapter 19 then verse 13 the Bible says then were there brought unto him little children and he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed hands Lord so children were brought for dedication children were never bapti what we see commonly being done because baptism one has to First believe now this child cannot understand anything and before you believe you must first hear the gospel this child cannot hear anything so the gospel is to Salvation you first hear the gospel and then the gospel convicts you and then you believe that gospel when you believe with the heart then you confess with your mouth this child can never confess with but then in the denominations they get you know they get false Witnesses maybe an auntie you know and then they say confess on behalf of the child that's deception it's not written in the Bible but now we pray for the little baby that at age of accountability you know like maybe about 12 years when you read in Luke 12 Luke 2 Jesus went to the temple and then he was able to talk with those doctors of Law and Priests about the word god so we take that as an age of accountability where somebody can make their own decisions praise the name of our Lord so we are going to dedicate in the hands of the [Music] Lord let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ this little that you've given to the family of our brother and sister Grace we see how the devil was taking the life of this baby last week came to bring the baby back to life father the same Grace that has watched over this baby the same Grace that has watched over the family we pray that father Your Grace May Contin be upon this B you Tau us also in your word that you appoint guardian angels to watch over the little children pray in the name of Jesus Christ that the angel that you've appointed upon may watch over this little baby and everywhere the baby will go she will leave with wherever she will stud whatever be doing watch over and may your Ang Heavenly Father bring her to the altar conf the Lord Jesus as our person we pray for the health of this baby we pray for the provisions of this baby we pray for the protection of this baby that Lord all your blessings may be upon us that Lord may use in such a special to be a handmade in your kingdom that your grace may come upon her life even as your Grace has been on our brother be a to stand in the services of the Lord for the upon this CH pray your protection re the evil one Satan power of Darkness that the devil may raise against this child and command the name of Jesus we pray that you may give the ability father and mother this child be a good example this child also ability F to financially take care of the needs of this child while this child grows up all the in the name ofus am God bless amen praise the name of our Lord amen am I that we stand up and then we take our scripture reading for today's service we are going to Luke chapter 8 verse 1 to verse 3 but before we read again father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we approach again your throne of grace and mercy asking you going to come and speak to us father through your word we understand that the heavens and earth were made by the word of when there was nothing completely and it's your word that we've come to feed on so Grant speak to us far according to your purpose and will in the name of the Lord Jesus us amen Luke chapter 8 we're reading from verse 1 to verse 3 so the Bible says and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and Village preaching showing the Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God and the TR with him and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary Magdalene out of whom went seven divots and Joan the wife of shua hel stward and Susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance may God bless of his word May seated I want to preach on ministering to God ministering to God and I pray God gives me the grace to be able to bring out what he has put upon my heart praise the name of our Lord ministering to God and many times we think that ministering to God God you know is only limited to men but you know it is the ministry of Christ where the Bible talks about Apostles pastors deons teachers and evangelist that is limited to God limited rather to men like in the Old Testament priesthood was only for men but then you will find that what the devil always does he will always do things contrary to God as long as God takes this direction the devil will endeavor to pull you out of the right direction like in the Old Testament praise the name of our Lord you know the PRI was committed to the sons of Aaron but then the devil in the Old Testament then you'll find also anointing women to be priests and then now the Christian Church takes it up but then you don't get it in the scriptures praise the name of but now to minister here which we want to talk about minister means to serve you know it's like to be a servant an attendant to wait upon to minister to one another praise the name of the Lord like the wife ministers to the husband praise the name of our Lord making preparations and things like that supplying the needs and so on then the husband now brings the requirements at and then the wife prepares them again now we've read here in Luke chapter 8 and then the Bible says and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and then yna the wife of su Herod stewards and suan and many others and then the Bible says they ministered to Christ with their substance they ministered to Christ with their substance and God has called every one of us that we can min minister to him by the abilities that he has given unto us that we minister to God by the talents that he has given to us that we minister to God by the resources he has given to us that we minister to God by the inference that he has given to us that we minister to God by the positions that he has placed Us in the society in the communities where we are that we can minister to God at your place of work you can minister to God at your home you can minister to God in the community where you live you can minister to God or along the path you can minister to God now there is a good example here when we go to the Book of Luke chapter 4 and then verse 27 praise the name of our Lord it says and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elias the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Nam now you see the scripture here says there were many lepers in Israel in the times of Elish the but none of them was cleansed except Syria now the question is how was n cleansed how was delivered praise the name of the Lord let us go to Second Kings chter 5 and then verse one second Kings 5 verse1 the Bible says now n captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto syia he was also a mighty man of Val but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and brought away captive out of the land of Israel a littleade and she waited on n's wife now you see the syrians went and took captive Israel and then they took a little and then this little was to's wife and now this little girl when she saw Nam the Master of the House much as was in great Authority much as God had given him a lot of viory he had leprosy and then the girl said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in E Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy now you see how God use this little God to serve him she test IFI about what the Lord can do and each and every one of us at our places of work where we live we can testify about the goodness of the Lord you can tell your colleagues What the Lord Has Done in your life praise the name of our Lord you can tell your neighb what the done in your life you can tell your family the Lord has done in your life you can tell strangers What the Lord Has Done in your life what are you doing you are ministering unto God when you tesy about the name of the Lord you are you are ministering unto God you are glorifying the name of the Lord so even this little man her testimony brought glory to the name of the Lord and then she told the mistress that you know there's the prophet in Israel he can kill all he can pray and heal this man of Leos but the Bible says there was no person who had ever been healed of leprosy by elishah but God revealed himself to this girl and this girl had the boldness to testify much as he was taken in captivity praise the name of our Lord so we can also testify we can testify at our places of we can testify where we live we can testify with the families that we live we can testify to the neighbors that we live in now testified about God and now the Lord Jesus picks it up and says n was the only person who healed in the days of Elish but how was he healed God used the little girl to bring that link praise the name of our Lord and God would also want to use you this morning God wants to use you at your place of life God wants to use you at your home God wants to use you wherever you want that the name of the Lord can be glorified so you don't say I'm not a preacher isn't there something that the Lord has done in your life that you can tell somebody about oh brother what happened at night snake was almost biting but the Lord saved him from that you are testifying you are giving encouragement to somebody and this is what the Lord wants us to do is the name of but you see what the devil does he wants to fill your mind with negative things that snake was going to bit slept hungry and I'm so [Music] hungry now the snake baiting you and sleeping hungry which would you want praise the name of the Lord but the devil just knows how to make sure that whatever God does is covered covered saying that you don't glory in the things that the Lord is doing will try to bring something and I've already seen it personally when the Lord does something and then you find you getting a lot of headache and then your mind What the Lord Has Done start all the head the head then you completely forget what the and that's why the devil does he will cause a problem here and then you forget the other thing like the children of Israel they were delivered out of bondage now they reach the Wilderness three days from the Red Sea the water is bitter oh This Bitter Water this bit and that's what the devil does to make sure that you don't glorify what the Lord is doing but this Syrian rather this little girl much as she was in captivity she was not living with her parents she didn't forget the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord that should be our lives let your life not be built on negative things let your life not be built on your weaknesses but build your life on What the Lord Has Done and even what the Lord has promised Just Keep On Believing you just keep on trusting praise the name of our Lord so God has called us and each and every one of us can Minister unto the Lord in a different ways God has put praise the name of our Lord now in Luke Chapter 2 Luke Chapter 2 and then verse 36 the Bible says and there was one Anna a prophetes the daughter of fenry of the tribe of Assa she was of great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about four SC and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day now the Bible says Anna of age 84 years she never left the temple but she served god with what praise the name of Lord verse 37 the Bible says she served god with fasting not only oneise the name she was in continuous fasting and prayers she was in continuous prayers now the question is who of us cannot do that fasting and praying praise the name of Lord she was ministering to God with fasting and with prayers everyone of us can serve the Lord with that you first when the Lord put that fast upon your heart and then you you separate yourself from the things and then you wait on the Lord you fast you pray was doing that kind of praise the name Sheed serving God she ministered unto God and each of us God has given us something whereby we can minister to God and when God has called you to minister to him do it with all your heart praise the name of the Lord do it with all your heart don't do it halfheartedly don't do it maybe for a show off don't do it you know in kind of you know M complaining don't do it this GR don't do that because God wants your service to be pure from your heart praise the name of our he wants your service to be pure from your heart so you don't do it to show others oh if it was not me nobody would do that that's not the way to do things praise the name of our Lord let us go to Romans chapter 12 and then we start from verse verse four for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of One of another having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith oh Ministry let us wait on our [Music] minister or he that exal on exaltation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that shows M with cheerfulness now here is giving the different kinds of way we can minister to God based on the ability that the Lord has given to you because we have several abilities praise name of like Anna the ability that God gave her was to keep in the church praying and fasting that's the God given praise the name of our Lord in praying and fasting and that that was so because she she was a widow she didn't have a husband to minister praise the name of our Lord now if for you have a husband you're not going to spend a whole day in church every day oh the Bible has told me I should to pray every time and fast every time oh every day you in overnight you're not going to do that because you have a husband to minister to now I'm not saying that you don't need to do that but you have a role to play going I'm going to be on missions all the time but you have children little children at home to raise and I have a m who going to raise for me the children no you're doing it the wrong way God has given you a role as a mother you can minister to God as a mother by raising the children in the way of the Lord like the mother of John Wesley she had so many children she was faithful mother and praise his children in the way of the Lord praise the name of the Lord you are a wife be as a good wife praise the name of our Lord by doing what is needed of you praise the name of the Lord but you see the devil is bringing many kind of contr thoughts this days and then I was hearing some program in the course of last week and then one of the Commissioners in the ministry of gender and then he was saying hous work which are done by the one they must be paid for praise the name but that's what the world is doing that's where the world is going but when you come as a family you have responsibility you do as a husband you provide and as a wife you are supportive now if you you as a husband you are providing whom do you want to pay you for doing that praise the name of the Lord and as the wife as being supportive you want also to be paid the salary for that even the children will ask you for salary for producing them and the world is becoming crazy you know we need this we need this we need this that's not the way it is if God does given you a role do it carefully praise the name of serve the Lord with all your heart not looking for this looking for this looking for that you don't do that and you know our countries such kind of mindset has taken place like I was reading about South Korea they don't want to give birth to Children until the population of the country the people who die are more than those who are produced very funtion but this is self destruction when we get away from the word of God so God has given us rules we have talked about Anna she was in the temple serving God day and and as a married woman praise the name of our Lord all the time you away from your home then did you marry praise the name of our Lord as a mother all the time you away from your children why did you produce them because as a mother you're meant to nurture these children you me to raise this children but you see the devil shows you something so that you miss the real call which the Lord has put before praise the name of our Lord because even at home you can pray from home while you taking care of the needs at home you can fast from home while you are taking responsibility as a mother and as a wife you can do this kind of things praise the name of our Lord but you see in some Churches praise the name of our Lord the wives just keeping overnight until the husband thinks there somebody she has gone out with they do things the other way around without following the order of the law praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us based on what God has given us ability to do let us wait on our Minister let us wait on the things that God has called us to serve as a mother be a faithful mother as a wife be a faithful wife as a father be a faithful father praise the name of our Lord and now we are living in a time that the devil has turned things upside down many nowadays especially the Young Generation they don't want take responsibility of home they only want to produce and doesn't mind how many they are producing and now it's the mother who suffers with the or the grandmother for him his work is produced doesn't care the first one is in ginger another one mother to him the pray is just giving bir but when you ask him knows what they at last night never sent any support for their when it comes to time of school fees the phones go off or they become sick that one that sick why did you produce them but this is the time we living that men are not taking responsibility of their hom the only thing they want is just be with a woman that's all the rest the woman suffers with that and then look for another then look for another then look for another that's how bad the world has become but now as children of God go we shouldn't do like the world is doing if God has called you to be a father be a father of your house praise the name of Take Charge over your house provide for your house praise the name of our Lord you don't know even your children how many clothes they have praise the name of you know some of them just now to work on themselves but child the clothes are all Tor what kind of father are you but God has called you to serve him as a father be a good example to raise your family praise the name of Lord if you a husband be responsible husband and when you fulfill every part God has put upon you you're serving God you're doing something which the Lord Delights in praise the name of our Lord or you come back home without food so what are you going to eat are you going to eat Stones when the Bible says as a father you are meant to provide for your house say me me I don't care my wife takes care of that so who what have you become praise the name of the Lord we need to see that we take the roads that God has given unto us if God has made me a father be a faithful father take charge over your children raise them in a good example if God has made me a husband let me be a faithful husband provide for the home take care of everything that's required of me if God has made me a wife let me do the same if God has made me a mother do the same praise the name of our Lord because it's God who has placed Us in different positions praise the name of our Lord and you know some of these things which we do which are not right in future they affect you and then you start wondering how I wish how I wish to avoid those things you better do the right thing now praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says God like in Ministry waiting on your ministry in whatever category God has blessed you to be if you are a child at be obedient to your parents praise the name of our Lord like now some children children they come from families that don't believe so if you are coming from family that doesn't believe be be a good example to your parents who don't fear God when you know it is time for church ask Mommy ask Daddy Daddy what can I do Mom what can I do and then you allow the work they give you on Sunday morning you do all that work Faithfully and then you ask for permission to come to church don't become rebellious at home praise the name of our Lord you know you may have a mother who is a witch witch and your father is a murderer those two parents it pleased God to give them to you praise the name of the Lord you have no better substitute those are your parents give them respect praise the name of Lord respect them and love them and pray for them your mother may be a prostitute she's still your mother pray for her that the Lord May deliver from those kind of but don't despise her don't disrespect her she's still your mother regardless of all that that she has around praise the name of you know Noah drunk himself until he became naked but it was not the responsibility of to laugh at his father and that's the same thing with you respect your parents regardless whether they don't believe what you believe they steal your parents just pray for them that the grace of God may come to them so as a child at that do what is expected of You by God be obedient to your parents you don't just leave home without caring you don't leave home without asking permission you don't do that praise the name of our Lord now let us continue let us go to Romans chapter 16 Romans chapter 16 and then we start from verse one he says I command unto F our sister which is a servant of the church which is at ceria you know she was doing a service to this church not that she was preaching but there is some work she was doing praise the name of our Lord you know for the services of the Lord may be cleaning the church praise the name of our Lord and now like our church here we don't have somebody with have to clean it but then you get Sister Rose OA spending time here cleaning let us clap for her taking her time to see that these things are put in place praise the name of the Lord she did service praise the name of our Lord and then you know like the sisters have a skill you know a talent that when they get to a place they can make it look different and then you start wondering what has happened to this place you can do the same here

chapati I just the there do you want to pick it from praise the name of the Lord when we have places where we can keep these things when I go there I packed m i Mo a bottle of water I drink I just throw it there then who is going to remove it from praise the name of our Lord yeah God has called us to minister to him we need to take responsibility praise the name of our Lord we all like living in a clean environment but then what are we doing to keep it CLE what are we doing to keep the place good enough for us praise the name of our Lord we need to take responsibility there is somebody I think there is a place I was in I don't I don't remember but I was in that place and then this man I think he either bought water or something now after use either eating or drinking he threw it down there in some town somewhere I'm just forgetting the place then when he threw we said now human who do you think will pick it for you said we pay tax say how much tax do you pay to remove that why don't we be responsible praise the name of our Lord you are moving maybe in a car you've got water and then now you just get a good vegetation place in a forest and you throw there Bott are you going to come and pick it for yourself why don't we be responsible and that's the same thing even here at church is we need to be responsible praise the name of our Lord we need to take responsibility over everything Lord has given us church now the Bible says F was the servant of the church at C she did service for that church not that she was preaching but she was helping in the work at that we need more favors here praise the name of our Lord we need more fa here in the church praise the name of you take your time and then you know that this thing needs to be worked need to be worked upon come and do that praise the name of our Lord like we have sometimes Holy Communion who takes responsibility to wash those Towers who takes responsibility to clean those glasses don't people going to wants you to praise the name of our yeah we need to offer service for the kingdom of God then the Bible says in verse two that you rece in the Lord as becometh s and that you assister in whatsoever business she has need of for she has been a sucker of many and of myself also now you look at the testimony of febe the Bible says she has been a helper many people and myself also praise the name of our Lord God is calling us to help one another to minister to one another to assist one another on the different abilities God has given we may not be able to do the same thing but there is something that God has blessed you with there is a skill that God has given you there's ability that God has given you he wants you to serve him in that kind and then he says greet Priscilla and aqua my helpers in Christ Jesus now you know there's something interesting about was the husband of aqu and aqua was a pastor of the first church in Rome but now when you see many records they talk about they Priscilla and aqua she was a woman of great influence there's a lot she did until they were not only mentioning about the husband the husband was a pastor but even as she came in there is something that the Lord give her ability praise the name of our so you don't and say I have nothing to do there is something that the Lord desires you to do the name of our take interest about church as a family praise the name of our Lord take interest God can give you Grace that you are the first person to person who is sick God can give you that Grace or God can give you Grace that you are the first person to go and encourage one who is affected God can give you that Grace God can give you Grace that you bear the burden of people in your heart and now there are those who are good at that sister do you know turn that into prayer because you know much about people and what you know are the problems go in prayer and pray for those people oh God I pray for this one's child oh God I pray for this one's husband oh God I pray for this one sister div put in prayer not not spreading RoR here praise the name of Lord you are good at getting information put it in prayer and then you bear that burden you take time at home and Lord I'm praying for sister Lord I'm praying for brothers and this brother doesn't care for his sister doesn't clean her children pray about it praise the name of our Lord but then you don't say ah or you w even take pictures of how that the children are no take it in prayer aqu aqu you know she took interest into the of the Lord and then she was being able to see that she support the ministry and this is how the Lord wants us to do praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says who have for my life laid down their own necks and whom not only I give thanks but also to all the churches of the Gentiles likewise greet the church that's in their house salute my well beloved epenetus who is first fruits of AA unto Christ the church was at their home Breen would come from home Li at home how about our homes praise the name of Lord can really God visit our homes praise the name of our Lord can God be happy to come to our homes we need to ask ourselves all the time there is this funny program fun program funny program until they are no visitation of angels we need to find ourselves maybe at home weing how about your life how about your heart is God happy to come in your heart is God happy is the spirit of God pleased to dwell in your life now in the message Elijah and the meal offering it says now it is a strange thing that God would send his Prophet to a widow woman's house what a place but she must have been a real virtuous woman or he would never send his Prophet there oh if a person was worthy we would be a worthy person to entertain a man like elah you remember it was Zacharia in in his house that had being Royal and true Waiting for God to give him a child and the angel Gabriel come to the house it was Virgin Mary who lived clean and pure and waiting for a promise of God that he sent an angel too so even you're living your cleanness your righteousness can cause God to come down and we need go to come down in our homes but for you why is your home having all those troubles all the time rebellious children complaining wife abusive husband how will God come there how will you have fellowship at home if the demons are happy to stay at your home they are busy there and let me tell you you know these demons identify one another complaining Spirits you'll see people people complain becoming close to one another because they have the same Spirits I thought this now again this is going to happen again I've added taxes going to build then another oh now these complaining Spirits they just congregate same spirits in the other things like when you read in the in the message when brother Bram was always Discerning when he identifies that this this is a spirit of cancer he identifies it or he mentions it then there this Spirit of cancer it calls other spirits of cancer to come and support it and then he tells people close your eyes don't open your eyes because this demon is refusing to live but he's calling other demons to come and fight when he talks about maybe a demon of heart pressure then those demons get identified in the congregation then he would say every person with heart pressure raise up your hand because he sees that if this person can be delivered here all the others same problem can so let not our homes be a d of demons demons of Rong Demons of complaining Demons of despising demons of this God cannot send his servant there that's what brother is saying he wouldn't send Elijah to a home like that the home was clean there was fear of God in that home and then God sent his servant to be there for a long period of time can God come and visit our homes praise the name of our Lord we make our homes Pleasant to God God was happy to visit Abraham why because their heart condition was right how about us is God pleased visit us is God happy to say this is my son is God Happ to say this is my daughter we need to see that we keep ourselves righteous then he says talk about running about with the world and Fleet with the world and then expect to see angels and have Miracles done it is out of God's prog you want God to do something for you keep your heart clean Keep Your Home clean the same thing with our church if you want God to visit us let us have the fear of God praise the name of the Lord then the Lord will come he says You must live right clean up the house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cards your world Association get ready and then the angel of God can speak and say fear not it is I praise the name of when your home is ready to receive God then he says the little woman was praying not knowing that walking down the mountain come the prophets he had a vision where to go God don't lead these people blindly he tells them where they are going he was looking into the city it was terrible people were starving to death and scaming for water and hungry it's a reflection of immorality a reflection of sin and this and this nation is in for it even the law of nature would not let it be when we are wasting money with r living and half of the world is staring today now he's talking about this woman a wi woman you know let us go to Luke and we pick it from there Luke chapter 4 where we read and then verse 25 26 Luke 4:25 he says but I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six month when great fine was throughout all the land but none of them was Eliah saent save unto Sara a city of sedon unto a woman that was a widow praise the name of the Lord now you when you get down to find out who this woman was she was living in a place where people were dying of her and you remember in those days when there was fine people would eat the D of animals people would eat one another's child just for the sake of hunger which was there but now this woman waited on the Lord she had a son and then she was preparing her last meal got out of the city to pick sticks and then she could prepare a meal and die because that was the end of it it was not raining but now the Bible says God sent there Elijah how many of us can have God sent somebody in our houses where God is very pleased to come down in our homes to come down in our families like now this widow woman God was pleased to send there a Prophet and then said that woman will minister to you now look at this woman she didn't have much and some of us think some of us to minister to God we need to have much but it is your heart's condition that is very important before God praise the name of some of us think to support the work of God I need to be saving a lot of money it is your heart praise the name of Lord it is your heart condition somebody may be earning too much but he doesn't care about the things of God while another ands too little but from the little they are they care to support the work of God this woman had too little but God looked at her sincerity God looked at her heart that this woman is faithful and so he sent there Elijah and the woman ministered to Elijah she was a widow woman I don't think she had the best house in town she was a widow woman I don't think she had many things that should be the same thing with us you may be sleeping in a small room and you don't have enough space but God may be pleased to come and that and for you may have a big house too many rooms but there's no room for praise the name of the Lord it may be like that so it's about our heart condition are we ready in the services of the Lord are we ready to give to the Lord are we surrender to the Lord praise the name of our Lord this woman was poor she had come to the end of her living but God respected her face brother Bram says she had an overnight meeting praying the whole night tomorrow I'm eating my last meal tomor this is end but then she didn't start choosing God oh Lord I Thank for the life you've given me for bring me to this and then in the morning God tells Elijah go to that place you'll say woman that I have commanded to take care of you praise the name of our we need to learn how to minister to God we don't need much to minister to even the little that we have we can use it to minister to the praise the name of our Lord don't wait to sa Vision I don't know if I'm being hard behind praise the name of our Lord don't wait but in the ability that God has given you God wants you to serve him now in the message enticing Spirits he says what is it what is it seeking first the kingdom of God not the not the kingdom of God all little noise not the kingdom of God and the little emotion but God in his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you now that Widow heart faith comes by hearing hearing by the word she said that's the word word of the Lord for that's a holy man of God that is God's prophet and I know it the truth and it's the word of God she didn't run across to ask the neighbors how to do it she didn't want to go to share and the neighbor said well what do you think that preacher is over my house saying this what do you think about this she went ahead and be to dump out she let go she let go of what she had that she may get more that's what the world needs today good old fashion letting go and got now this woman Elijah told her first make a me for me and then when elah told her that he said God will F so now brother Bram is saying when she would go and remove the meal then God would F she removes God fs and that's the same thing in the Services of the Lord the more you minister to God the more he gives you the grace in the ministry praise the name of the Lord the more you give to God the more he gives you but when you retain from God then you limit Yourself Praise the name of our Lord that's also in nature when a leg receives water when a leg receives water when a l receives water and it doesn't give out it becomes dead but if it can receive the water and it Lees the water to keep on flowing it becomes aive praise the name of the Lord so when this woman continued making a meal for Elijah then God kep on sustaining her God kept on giving that's also the same thing with us we need to minister to the Lord in the abilities that God has given us and the more you serve the Lord the more grace God gives you praise the name of our we need to learn how to serve the Lord praise the name of you need to learn how to serve God Faithfully praise the name of our Lord now let us go to the scripture here Acts chapter 9 ver 36 9:36 so the Bible says and they went on their way and they came to a certain sorry 36 is now there was at Jer a certain disciple named tabi which by interpretation is called docas which this woman was full of good works and arms did which she did praise the name of Lord now the Bible says was full of good [Music] works and then she did a lot of arms deed and now as the body of Jesus Christ we need to be full of good works and we need to be supportive of one another praise the name of the Lord we need to be supportive of one another now was doing this until the Bible says when she died people were mour until they called for Peter oh we have a problem we have our sister she has done this and the Bible says they brought the things that she had made for them in verse 36 and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom they had washed When and they laid her in the upper chamber much as leader was night Jer and the disciples had heard that Peter was there they sent unto him two men Desiring him that he would not delay to come to them then Peter Rose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by weeping and showing the coats and garments which which doas made while she was with them praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says died the people she had blessed her came with the court she has made and then they started displaying them this is what she did this is what she did this is how good she was this is what has been happening praise the name of then what about us here as a church in a family what can you be remembered about praise the name of the Lord what will you be remembered about as somebody who was kind as somebody who was compassionate as somebody who was giving his as somebody who was helping others tab was remembered for her courts that she made for the people until they were concerned about her and then they called for Peter to come and raise tab from the why she was ministering to by supporting the Saints praise the name of our Lord we also need to learn the same thing that you can bless others you can be a blessing to others but the things that God has given praise the name of our Lord some of us have got a lot of cloes we don't use at home why do you keep them at home why do we keep them at home when there are people who don't have those clothes some of us you know we have maybe too many sand there the mattresses you feel you are fed up of this but even your St is too full of those why are you keeping them there now giving you don't only give out old things praise the name of the Lord you don't give out only those things you don't like but even something you say ah this thing is good for my brother I can give this to my sister I can give this to my brother praise the name of our Lord like maybe you've stopped producing children but you have things of babies at home you pick some of them and say Let me give this brother let me give this sister it can help them you know we need to be concerned about one another you know this brother has a problem this sister has a problem and then God can give you the ability to help take interest in supporting them and then there are some people who are in positions of influence you can influence and then you can help a brother or sister who needs a job and then you can say okay I work with this organization now brother you finish this course I finish this course bring your papers let me how I can help you praise the name of the Lord why do you want to be there alone praise the name of you want to be there as a boss alone or if God has blessed you with a good business skill why do you want only to be the successful business there help others you see this man is struggling help them this one desires to learn this help them that's what the Lord wants us to do praise the name of our Lord we can now move on to the next one praise the name of our Lord let us go to marthew chapter 8 Matthew chapter 8 and then verse 14 the Bible says and when Jesus was coming to Peter's house he saw his wife wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she Rose and ministered unto them praise the name of the Lord the Bible says when Peter's mother-in-law was sick Jesus healed her when he healed her she didn't sit back how about us are we sitting back are we sick not to minister are we sick not to minister find something you can do for the kingdom of praise the name of the Lord don't tell me I can't do anything there are so many things to be done there are so many things to be done for the kingdom there are so many ways we can minister to God now you can imagine Peter's mother-in-law old woman when she got healed she rose up started doing something around how about us let us be found doing something for the body of Jesus Christ let us be found doing something in our services to the Lord let us not take the spirit of the end time you know the Bible says various times shall come men shall be lovers of themselves no natural affection of the they don't care about another person God has called us out of this world not to live like they were but to be like the true children of God praise the name of our Lord and God is expecting us to minister to him in the way that the abilities that he has given to us God has given us sever abilities there are many opportunities in the services of the Lord and God wants us to participate in praise the name of our Lord let us go to Matthew chapter 25 Matthew 25 and then verse 41 the scripture says and then he shall say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you cast into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his [Music] angels for I was hungry and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you closed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord when so with the hungry or thirsty or stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying I say unto you in as much as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me praise the name of the Lord now this was on the Judgment Day and then he's telling the people who were on the left hand side when I was sick you never visited when I was in prison you never Vis when I was naked you never dressed when I was hungry you never F when I was thirsty you never give me they were selfish they were just concerned about their own selves and that's the same Spirit of the age and you know the spirit inia is a spirit where it says I'm full of goods I'm too rich and there's not satisfaction to the things you can possess you know somebody wants to take over the whole village where would the other people live now where are you pushing them praise the name of the Lord you know there was a place and now this man was too rich and he kept on buying buildings in the town and whatever building he buys he chases way the people are using the and the building stays there for a whole year again he goes and buys another look at that craziness then you ask him why is he buying the building and not us he doesn't want anybody to be there he was making the town a ghosty town but this is the president we have now somebody goes and buys land land tches away the squarters and the land they areolate how is that wondering craziness but this is the end time spirit that we have somebody wants to buy everything and doesn't use them while the other people are there they don't have anything but he doesn't care and then there I think is in Proverbs where the Bible says that if you deprive some people either food or something they will C you people don't fear cures now I don't care that's what is happening the Bible says he told them when I was naked you never dressed so you need to be concerned if my brother doesn't have clothes to put on why can't I help my brother praise the name of the Lord maybe somebody's shoes are worn out until they have cracks down now it is raining the water will enter inside you have too many you don't care and then another you see that even the col is completely worn out and maybe you want to demonstrate and then use him what happened to your shirt another praise the name of the Lord not moing him in his condition you know we need to be concerned about one another and then he says I was hungry and you never paid me and then you hear this brother this is the condition is in get food and take to their praise the name of our Lord and then different kind of needs I was in hospital I was in prison and you never visited me take interest to go and visit another who's in a bad condition to go and encourage another one praise the name of the Lord and then this asking Jesus when did we see you naked when did we see you you know hungry when did we see you seeck when did we see you in prison and we never ministered unto you and then he says since you didn't do it to this my brethren you never did it to me praise the name of our but God has called us to minister to him in the different things we can do in Luke chapter 8 these women minister to Christ with their subst we need to minister with what God has given to us it may be money it may be resources like we having a meeting here two weeks from you may have food and say oh no let me bring food to the trustees maybe you have money let me bring money to the trustees so that there's no work there's no lack in the service of the Lord praise the name of our Lord we need to take concern about the things of the you want to be blessed are you also blessing others praise the name of our Lord wants us to minister praise the name of the Lord let us go to Hebrews chapter 6 and then verse 10 as I try to finish Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10 so the Bible says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have show toward his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister amen he said you minister to the Saints and he says you are still ministering to the praise the name of the Lord there's a brother here in church that God put a burden upon his because we do missions every week Mission and you know it's a lot of expenses until sometimes you get into debts but there's a brother God put upon his heart that every week she sent say that this is fuel 100,000 200,000 the burden is upon him not that he's having too much but God has put such a burden upon his us they don't know situation is so bad but the other woman OFA she was a widow woman she had a young son the husband had died WID with a young son and only one mill left but she ministered to the prophet of God how about you you may not be in that condition of that we that you have the last to but you don't have faith that when I give this God can increase praise the name of Lord you don't have that Faith but you know you need to have faith and then there's a brother here and then was telling me that for him when he gets his salary he has given God more than 50% and the remaining uses it that is Faith the Bible says test me and see try me and see praise the name of the Lord but now for you you be looking the need will never cease praise the name of the Lord but let me tell you the secret just as you can't keep your life praise the name of our Lord you don't know what happens tomorrow why don't you commit yourself to God and if God doesn't need Supply that need praise the name of our Lord be there and give yourself put things in the kingdom of God you don't make any loss because the Bible says store up riches in heaven where there is no Thief there is no mo is sweet when it's in this pocket here th can come and pick pocket do you know how theves can even steal your [Music] money me there is another thief of sickness are you going to start with that sickness you go to hospital and spend now you refuse to give God who heals and then the Devil comes with his sick and then you can't spend you are all the time in hospital maybe you have not learned how to give to God I not even fall sick then problems can keep on coming a bottomless to drain you you receive like this it is blown like this you receive like this blown like this learn to give into the kingdom and that little you have God will preserve it and God will magnify praise the name of the Lord learn how to give learn how to support learn how to help don't be like the end time spirits of no I only love myself and my family that's all no on the Judgment Day he told them when I was naked you didn't dress me when I was hungry you didn't give me what to eat when I was sick he didn't Vis me how how did we miss ministering he said these are my brethren you never took care of them praise the name of let us be concerned about one let us be concerned about the kingdom of be concerned sickness doesn't have a praise the name of the Lord but these are things that God can Faith let me say these are things God Faithfully protects you from every day he keeps you safe what do you have to thank him for what do you have to give him to praise the name of the Lord now in the message Hebrews chapter 2 he says that stand old Prophet looked that woman in the face he said go B me a cake fast he God is saying minister to me first give to the services of the Lord first then he says what a command for a man to tell a widow woman starving to death to feed him fast what did he say praise the name of then he say for thus says the Lord the bar will never go empty neither The Cruise dry until God sends rain on the earth and the Lord Jesus tells us God knows that you have need of all the things so what do you do serve him minister to him praise the name of the Lord don't do it reservedly and you know there are some places there is a place actually I was told the other brother is concerned how much money comes to the church and then he follows what did the other money do about the other then you ask him how much did you put there praise the name of you know now they have taken long you see the walls are dirty I don't know why they're not painting what have you done praise the name of the Lord look at def I don't know what doing about what are you doing praise the name of be concerned for the kingdom of God oh you know nowadays the toilets this what have you done praise the name of our Lord

brother has done this what can I do praise the name of our Lord take interest be involved in the services of the and the needs are not and the need can never end but as long as you are alive God has called you to support so don't support and say this month I'm stopping the Bible says they Minister the needs of the saint and they keep on ministering and he says don't give up the Bible says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your works and Labor of Love show towards his name what works have you sh what lab have you sh salvation is a free gift but when he has given us a free gift of Salvation what works have I done for what what lab have I done for What the Lord Has I don't about the there's a question mark there brother Bram says eternal life is living for others now he's not talking about your family now because it's your responsibility even those people don't have eternal life they take care of their families but now you have eternal life are you helped are you ready to help a stranger are you ready to help one who is in what are your Works what are your labors where is your ministering to the body of J praise the name of our Lord each of us God has called us if I don't

Barrow never went empty and the cruise never dry until God sent rain on the earth she put God before her children that's the same thing now God wants us to put him before before amilies before our interest she put God before anything else she taken the kingdom of God first God must have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are God
