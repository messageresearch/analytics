We're happy to be back again. Praise the name of our Lord. So on Sunday we shall be having two services. We are going to have the Lord's supper as well. So we come when we are prepared. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us turn to the book of Revelations. We're reading in chapter 18 from verse one to verse 5. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory." And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, "Beon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every false spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful band. For all nations have drank of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are works to reach through the abundancy of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues. for her sins have reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquities. May God blessing of his word. You may be seated. So I want to draw my subject from verse four which says come out of her my people. So I want to preach on calling out the elect. Praise the name of our Lord. Calling out the elect. Now we see that this mystery Babylon When you go back to the scriptures, it started from the book of Genesis when Nimrod and the people at that time they were building a tower and that place was called Babel and Babel means confusion. you know all those kind of thing. So now they their purpose of building the tower they wanted to reach heaven and they wanted to reach heaven without going through the right process. So they had nimrod for a king and the Bible says he was a mighty hunter. Now being a mighty hunter, he was actually hunting down righteous people, persecuting them, killing them, forcing the people to follow his religion. you know he desired to make a religion for himself and he made that religion and then he was able to lure the people. So now he established that as a great civilization in his day when you read in Genesis chapter 9 and chapter 10. Now there is just something that has come in my mind. You know when the people read in the scriptures in Genesis chapter one and then the Bible says and God said let us make man in our image and then they say you see there are three but they lack the understanding of the scriptures because if you read also in this time of Nimrod The Bible says in Genesis, &gt;&gt; let us get the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 11 and then verse 5. Okay, we can start from verse one. It says, "And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, and they found a plane in the land of Shina, and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, "Go, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone and slime they had for motor. And they said, "Go, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto the heaven, and let us make a name. Let us be lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. H2. So they wanted to go to heaven in kind of like a physical way, you know, because like if you want to go up, you put stairs to climb up. So now they also wanted to take time get to heaven. And the Bible says the Lord came down to the city and the tower which the children of men builded. And so the Lord said, "Behold, the people is one and they all one language. And this they begin to do. And now nothing will restrain them from which they have imagined to do. Now you see say they are determined they are going to do it. So you see that Babylon or &gt;&gt; Babel is the beginning of organized religion is the beginning of denomination. Some people reject the leadership of the Holy Spirit and then they have their own leadership. It doesn't matter what the word of God says. don't care what the word of God says. It's all about what they want to do. So now God said in verse seven, "Go to let us go down and confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech. Now who was God talking to that let us go down. It was not the trinity that father is here son is here. The holy ghost is here. So the father is telling the son the holy spirit let us go down. It wasn't so. So you can get the understanding of this scripture in Genesis 18 when God came down with two angels. When you read Genesis chapter 18, when God says let us make man in our image, the Bible says God is a spirit. So the image of God the man he created in Genesis chapter one spirit man. In Hebrews chapter one the Bible says the angels are ministering spirits and he made a man as a spirit in Genesis one. So when we make money in our image talking about angels when he says let us go down he's talking about angels. So it's not that there are three gods three persons but it's only one god manifesting himself in different ways. Praise the name of our lord. Now we see organized religion started by Nimrod you know. So Babel &gt;&gt; when God because the Bible says &gt;&gt; verse 9 therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth. Now you find the also spoken about in the middle of the Bible &gt;&gt; because Babel &gt;&gt; became Babylon in the times of Nebuchadnezzar. If you read in the book of Isaiah and the book of Daniel and you know that Babylon, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. was the head of God. And now this head of God was a very great gentile kingdom. He took over all the earth. Now you see that the image of Daniel had four kind of kingdoms. He had the head of gold. He had the the shoulders and the chest of silver which was actually the Persian and Persian and Median kingdom. Then it had the belly and the size of brass which was actually the Greek kingdom. Then it had the legs of iron and clay which was the Roman kingdom. And then the Bible says in Daniel 2, the stone was cut without hands the image at the feet. Now we need to know. Praise the name of our Lord. The times of the gentile started from the time of Babylon took over Jerusalem. And from the time Nebuchadnezzar has taken over Jerusalem, Jerusalem has always been dominated by the Gentiles. We know now of course Israel is in their homeland, but the international community, &gt;&gt; the international community they recognize Jerusalem not as the capital of Israel and they say Israel has no right over Jerusalem. They say Jerusalem is an international city. You can imagine Jerusalem &gt;&gt; where the temple mount is you know right now there is a mosque of Omar and now that area is not governed by the government of Israel but I believe it is Jordan which governs that place. And then Turkey comes in and other Arab countries come in to manage the affairs of that area. Even Jerusalem, the international community recognizes it as belonging to the Palestine. But we are living in the time that Jerusalem, praise the name of our Lord, great worship. will go back to the Jews. Praise the name of the Lord. So we see we are living in the time of the fulfillment of the prophecies. Now at the time we are living in we have another Babylon which the Bible calls mystery Babylon. And now this mystery Babylon the Bible says COMMITS FORNICATION WITH ALL THE NATIONS of the world rur all over the world. Now we see that the prophecy of Daniel chapter 2 shows THAT THE FIRST COMING of Jesus Christ comes when it is the Roman Empire ruling the world. Then the second coming of Jesus Christ happened still when the Roman Empire is still ruling. Even the third coming of Jesus Christ, he comes to destroy that kingdom. So when Jesus was born, &gt;&gt; it was the emperor Rome. You know they were kings. But now this Roman Empire has changed over. It's now a religious kingdom. And now it is mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So it is going down in every kingdom to see that they bring the union of religions together. Praise the name of our Lord. the time we are living in over just this weekend they were commemorating 1,700 years at the time they put that committee in 325 edition you know the union where the religions came together Pay attention to what I'm saying now. So that time they had differences in doctrine and everything. So now when different people came together you know people who were pretenders to be Christians worshippers Christians and everybody when they came together then they instituted the trinity they started all the false teachings and so it was move that time. It was Constantine was putting that together was the emperor of Rome at that time and now the emperor of Rome. Now the emperor of Rome, praise the name of our Lord, the religious system is now bringing all the religions together. Praise the name of God. Now we are living in a time where deception is at its highest. Praise the name of God. BUT NOW THE BIBLE HAS told us in Revelations chapter 18 that another angel came down from heaven. Praise the name of our Lord. BECAUSE THE WORLD WAS ALL DECEIVED. You know they were all thinking we are in the move of God. Romans chapter 4, one Lord, one baptism, one everything, one faith. And so they are collecting all the religions to come together and they think it is the move of God. But the Bible says in Revelations 18:1, "And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven having great powered with his glory." Now, in the message I'm against organized religion, in paragraph 205. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now here comes another messenger coming down the next chapter because he was he was first reading Revelation 17 where the mystery was, you know, revealed of what the mystery of Babylon was. And then now he says in the next chapter which is now chapter 18 now this is now the discovery of her mystery and her children's mystery. See, we understand now exactly what her her a lot because she committed adultery against God's word. And that's what made her an organization. She couldn't stay a a Bible church. and accept that and neither can any organization that don't take every word of it the way it is wrought ever be a Bible church and there is none of them that I know anything about not one. So there see as soon as she organizes the things she does both by scripture and the evidence is right there. She accepts the dogma. Now look what has happened. God God sent &gt;&gt; God sent in the this 18th chapter a mighty angel after that mystery was known a mighty angel or a messenger. &gt;&gt; Watch here. After these things, I saw another angel come from heaven. This great power and the earth was lightened by his glory. After then he says and he cried with a loud voiceon confusion the great is falling &gt;&gt; and is become the habitation of devils every hold of every false spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful And all nations have drunk of the wine of her wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth have committed fornications with her and the merchants of the earth as works rich through the abundance of her desolate. In paragraph 207, Luke, immediately after her mystery was made known, who she was, what she was, who her daughters was. The mystery has been made known. Then God sent an angel, a messenger to what &gt;&gt; to call out, &gt;&gt; come out the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So we have the MESSAGE THAT IS CALLING OUT THE ELECT. &gt;&gt; It's calling the elect out of, you know, organized religion. HE'S CALLING THE ERECT OUT OF BABYLON. And then the message is saying, "DON'T PARTAKE OF HER SINS." Brother Brennham TELLS US WE SHOULD organize religion like a plague. The way you were careful about corona until even you would spray wherever you're going to touch. You spray even on the doors, the handles. Be careful about organized religion because organized religion means death before God. Spiritually dead because they have rejected the Holy Spirit. So now we have the message of the hour that calls us out. Praise the name of our Lord. IT CALLS OUT OF ALL the denominations because that's Babylon. It is confusion. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S happening nowadays. Everything they are doing is not word based. They only bring the word once and then they follow what they want to do. Praise the name of our Lord. And then the problem that we have, people are going back to their religions and they pick one thing or two things and come picking again another hybrid. But the message of the hour that we have got, praise the name of our Lord, the message that we have calls us out from all those traditions of those religions in the message the feast of the trumpet in Revelations 12 11 their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elias calling to Israel calling them out of the Jewish traditions now Israel right now they are blind they don't know what really happened God blinded them but now they are thinking that the atonement is still on the blood of animals. No wonder they got the red hers and then it was a big public. They taking them to Israel. They are protecting them. That's still a Jewish tradition. But now after the rapture, God is going to send Elijah and Moses who will go and call out the 144,000 Jews and call them out of the Jewish traditions and show them the true atonement and the true atonement is our Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of the Lord because they are still blind but they are waiting for the Messiah. So now here in the message the feast of the trumpet brother Brandham says Moses and Elijah are to come and call the Jews of Israel. Praise the name OF OUR LORD OUT of the Jewish tradition. Praise the name of our Lord. Let me read it to you. It says, "Just as the seventh angel, Just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the Pentecostal tradition. And now we are in the message, but we want to go back the Pentecostal tradition. You know in Pentecost to receive the Holy Spirit you must speak in tones and then here we are. You must feel emotions. Pentecostal tradition and then we feel going by that brother until you feel something that's not the evidence of the Holy Spirit. But this is where we are getting ourselves. If I don't feel well, if I don't feel excited, I've not gotten the Holy Spirit. And the Bible says doesn't come with observation. Praise the name of course, somebody can talk about the day of Pentecost. But on the day of Pentecost and you read the book of Acts, other areas when the Holy Ghost filled the people, It's only on the day of Pentecost where you find the tongue of fire on their head. So their eyes would see that tongue of fire. Their bodies would feel that wind in the room pimples coming. Then the tanks were quickened. You know, you know, the the tongues spoke, the eyes saw, the body felt, the ears he had that sound. But that same day on Pentecost, 3,000 were added. Did the wind again come, the blowing, the tanks were were on their way. It's not the same, but it's the same Holy Spirit. You go to Acts chapter 8, you go to Acts chapter 9, you go to Acts chapter 10, you go to Acts chapter 19. The Holy Ghost was filling them. But what happened was totally different. Praise the name of our Lord. So now the Pentecostals speak that you have to speak in tongues. And then we also go and pick there. &gt;&gt; You have to feel. &gt;&gt; How did you feel? &gt;&gt; That's not so praise the name of our Lord. So the message of the hour takes us from those Pentecostal traditions. until you get somebody looked for the Holy Ghost since 10 years. &gt;&gt; You've looked and you've never got there's something wrong. You don't know what you're looking for. Praise the name of our Lord. The quote pastor read on Sunday, God is not an Indian giver. He says but let me this way that's not God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. That's not how he does things. But then our mind has come like that because we have a contrary understanding to what the Holy Spirit is. There is a sister. Praise the name of our Lord. So she went with that same understanding and so she was in one church. The emotions happened the way they described that that's the Holy Spirit and then she went home. When the time for the next service came, she told the person she was staying with, I don't need to go to the Holy Ghost. Contrary, if you have the Holy Spirit, will draw you always into the presence of God and where they serve. It's the life of Christ. It's a continuous fountain. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. If you have the Holy Spirit, you'll have the life of Jesus Christ. But you get somebody says for you don't have the Holy Spirit. And he says for him, he has the Holy Ghost but to hate people. Then you start wondering where the Holy Spirit is in that person. Where is the life of Jesus Christ? So the message of the hour comes and takes us from that tradition Pentecostal traditional and then he says remember okay he says the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the Pentecostal tradition Praise the name of our Lord. And then he says, remember Moses and Elijah used to call Israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and the sheep and the blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice. to the word. Praise the name of our Lord. Now we know that the true atonement is the blood of Jesus Christ. Now the blood of Jesus Christ is the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. So the true atonement now is the message of the hour. That's where forgiveness of sins because sin is unbelief. Praise the name of our Lord. So the message calls the elect out of confusion of baby Lord, out of confusion of Pentecost, out of confusion of Baptists. all this confusion. Praise the name of Lord. The message is calling us out of Babylon. And the seventh angel's message under the same seal is to call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and world tradition. to the genuine atonement. The word &gt;&gt; Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh among us. Praise the name of Lord. That's the message of the hour. So outside of the message of the hour, there's no atonement. True atonement is in the message of the hour. How do you escape Babylon? Come to the message. Praise the name of our Lord. Take the message. How the Lord has given to us. That's where our atonement is. Praise the name of our Lord. So that calls out the bride from the confusion. Praise the name of the confusion of religion, the deception of religion. And we see the time we are living in the plant, the whole maze is dry. Why? Because the life has gone into the seed. And the seed now is the life of Christ which is in the elect. The bride of Jesus Christ. So each and every one of us you need to desire that life of Jesus Christ to live right inside of you. Praise the name of our Lord because it is a calling out. And when he calls us, he calls us out, he calls us to the union with Christ. &gt;&gt; So now we unite with Christ, which is his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord and that makes us to be ready for the rapture. Now in the message the feast of the trumpet he says paragraph 207 also that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under madom back there and under the church ages. is praise the name of the Lord. So he says the churches have bound the Holy Spirit 2,000 years. How did they bind the Holy Spirit? They bound the Holy Spirit by their creeds and doggy. Praise the name of our Lord that the Holy Spirit cannot work in the church because of manmade systems. Praise the name of our Lord. But she's going to be liberated. She's coming back. That's what the Bible said. Praise the name of our Lord. So when people go to traditions, they went in the time of the Lord Jesus Christ, they had their traditions, wash your hands this way. Don't eat with unwashed hands. Do this. And he says in vain do they worship. And people take those things to be so serious. You know they they are so dear to them. But when you present the word of God they reject the word of God. So he says they wash me by their mouth but their heart is far from me. So that's how it has been in the ages that people took their crits and doggy. people took their kind of own traditions and that was their form of worship. That's why in every age God was sending a messenger and that messenger was to bring the people back to the truth. Praise the name of Lord. So the message that God sent was the deliverance for the people of that time. Praise the name of the Lord. Because people had left the word and the plea of God. Come back to the word. Come back to the word. Come back to the word. And there can never be a true revival if the people don't get back to the right word. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So when you read in Revelations chapter 2, you see every age had a messenger and a message for every age was being given to the messenger. unto the angel of Ephesus righteously. Revelations 2:1. Then in Revelations 2:7 at the end of the message of the age, he says, "Let him that as an ear what the spirit says to the church." But how was the voice coming? The voice was coming through the messenger of the day. So even now in this ludician age, &gt;&gt; we have heard the voice of the Holy Spirit using brother William Marion Brham, the message of the hour. Praise the name of our Lord. Now the ministry of brother Brham was proved beyond doubt. Praise the name of our Lord. God proved it as the message of the hour. Now what the devil does is to make you doubt what we have been given to make you not take it serious to make you take it lightly. You know, you don't care. See what the devil is doing. Praise the name over like what we were sharing in the morning exaltation. So the devil make sure that you have no time for the message. You are too busy to read the message. You are too busy to hear the message. So you get yourself in deception. That's what the devil does. He makes sure you don't hear. He makes sure you know you have many troubles. So you are afraid to identify yourself as a message believer even at your place of work. You don't want where you fellowship from. You don't want tell people that God has sent us a message. You are just too busy over other things, too busy at work, too busy on the phone, you can afford to spend all the time on other media. But now when it comes to the table where the message of the our application is maybe when you have doubt that's when you try to go there. Once in a while maybe you like sometimes these phones can tell you your your space is getting over and then they tell you unused applications. You last used the table two months ago. So you start ah but why not delete all And I said, "Sure, let them be deleted." But you are creating space for Tik Tok videos, &gt;&gt; creating space for WhatsApp, space for Facebook, Facebook. And that's what the devil is doing to us that we don't have enough time. We don't have enough time. You have this program and the other program and the things of God they are taken lightly. That's what the devil is doing. So then how will you know what the Lord has prepared for us? When the Bible says, "Praise the name of our Lord." In the book of John chapter 10 and then verse 27, it says, "My sheep hear my voice." John 10:7. and I know them and they follow me. Now if his sheep hear his voice, which voice do you hear? And there are so many voices, but the voice of God is a still small voice, very humble. Praise the name of our Lord. How you need to get yourself acquainted with the voice of God. Keep hearing that voice on a daily basis. Find time. Praise the name of our Lord. Let the message and hear what the prophet says. Find times. Praise the name of Lord that you are not taken unawares. you know, so that you're not surprised about what's happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of God. Let us go back to the message, the feast of the trumpet. He says &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2,000 years. Verse is, but it is to be loed in the evening time by the evening time message. The Holy Spirit back in the church again, Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy Spirit calls the elect out of denomination &gt;&gt; so that we can have fellowship with the Holy Spirit. We can have communion with the Holy Spirit. And when we come out, he gives us the mana from heaven, &gt;&gt; true manner from heaven, which is the message of the hour. Praise the name of the Lord. So as elect who have been called out, we have a responsibility. Praise the name of our Lord to take the whole council of God. The message that the Lord has given unto us. See that you don't take it lightly. See that let it be so dear to you. Praise the name of our Lord because it is the message that prepares us for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. When brother Brham was baptizing in 1933 in June in Ohio River, praise the name of our Lord. A bright shining light came down from heaven and then came, praise the name of the Lord, when he was baptizing on the river and a voice said as John the Baptist was sent for the first coming of Jesus Christ. You are sent with the message to forun the second coming of Jesus Christ. We have a message that prepares us for the rapture. Praise the name of our Lord. We have a message that reveals Christ to us. So it is very important for everyone of us to take the message to be personal. personal to you. Read what the Lord has said of these things. Praise the name of our Lord. Not the times and the seasons we are living in. Don't just do here say praise the name of our Lord. Know yourself and read the things. We have a lot of books around. Why don't you take time and read your book meditatively? You know, read these things. Take a book. You can have a target. Maybe every week I'm going to read a book. You pick this message. You start reading it from the very beginning. Don't be in a rush. Take your time. Read it. Because we have a privilege here that each of us can have their own copies. Take time and read the things all the time on Facebook until the whole night three four hours on Facebook. But what these messages you can find that within 3 or 4 hours you know you have finished a a book a message book you've already finished it why don't you take time have a purpose in your life have a target in your life don't just wait when you come to church oh what have they given us today and then you go with that quote and some people they busy looking for quotes from other pastors or ministers. No, why don't you go to the original things? But you just want to hear from somebody's interpretation, explanation and then that excites you and all the time you are checking. All the time you are checking and then there are some people who know how to to roam around services in different churches. They have enough data to go and listen to a service somewhere there. following another service somewhere there. Why don't you take that time to read the message? Praise the name of that time you are putting on. Why don't you take time and listen to a message and hear from the original otherwise you may end up getting spirit somewhere. Then you get confused then but they don't teach it like that and you find your heart withdrawing. Go and feed from the original. Praise the name of Lord. Take your time and read this message book. Not just speaking one paragraph and the whole week you have only one paragraph. No, go and read the whole message book. See the background. How is brother not approaching this subject? What explanation is he giving how is he concluding it then you know today I've read this message maybe next week I'll read another message week I'll read another message and you find a lot of things there. That will influence your life and your thinking is going to change. Your speech is going to change. Decision making is going to change. You find there are even testimonies. Maybe he's giving a testimony of something about this thing. Praise the name of Lord. You know the way the Bible is written is how the message has also been preached. When you read in the scriptures like I'll give an example. There is a man who was a who was a he was a man who was heading a synagogue and then he came to Jesus and they told Jesus this man is honorable and then now the man said my patient my my child is sick and then they started walking with Jesus but you know along the way that story ends And then a woman of blood issue comes in and then he touches him and then the attention of Jesus is a woman with a blood issue. Now if you take a quote you may end up that Jesus was moving going there but you know what happened there because you're only taking a quote. You're not going further to look at the conclusion of the issue or you only read a part like some of these friends of ours on their religious crusades. They get a scripture and pick only half of the scripture and now they start confusing you. If you don't read the scriptures before and the scriptures after, you'll be confused like them. And even some that's how they read the message. This is a very what was he up to? Praise the name over. You read the book in Genesis, you find the Bible is talking about Jacob. Then when it goes to Jacob, then it goes to Joseph. Then it leaves somewhere there. Then again it goes to Judah. Then they come back to Joseph afterwards. So if you stop the other side, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT the the story concludes with. And this is how the Bible is written. Even this is how the message is. Brother Brenham starts on this story. He leaves it halfway. He goes somewhere else. And that's how the Holy Ghost works. The same thing with discernment. People in the prayer line. One comes says now discerns him. But maybe he's talking to him. The Holy Ghost goes somewhere there. He leaves this one. Now you there this and this and this. Then from there, oh now this one here for you are here waiting. And that's how the scriptures are written. That's how the message is written. Praise the name of Lord. So you need to take time, read the message from the beginning, bring it to the end and get the right conclusions. Praise the name of Lord. That's how you we study. You don't just learn something and then you say, You take time and study. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to take time and study and we shall not be deceived. Praise the name of our Lord. Like you know when you read in the the book of Revelation, praise the name of our Lord. You know these are interesting things. It teaches you what the scriptures are. Praise the name of I just want to pick something here. You know when you read in Revelations chapter 6, it brings in the first seal, second seal, the third seal, the fourth seal, the sixth seal. Praise the name of our Lord. Now after the sixth seal, and then you go to Revelations 7, He talks about the redemption of the Israel and then the redemption of the foolish virgin. Then he goes to Revelations chapter 8. Verse one. Then he says when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of an hour and that seal is over. Then he starts I saw the seven angels given seven trumpets. So you need to get into the message of the hour to rightly to place these scriptures where they belong. Praise the name of our Lord. Brother Brenham, by the revelation of God, all these seven trumpets, they are sounded under the secret seal. Praise the name of God. But verse one says the seventh seal. Verse one says the seventh seal and then he goes back to the sixth seal. And then he talks about the trumpets. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he gets Revelation 10. He talks about Revelation the the seventh angel. Then he goes to Revelation 11. He goes back to the sixth seal. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to take time. Let us read the whole message. Start the book from the beginning. Bring it to an end. You not get the confusion you can get. Like when they read the message marriage and divorce, they pick one quote and then they move with that that they don't get the background and the conclusion. Praise the name of God. So to to avoid being deceived, read these message books. Praise the name of God. Read the message books. Don't stop at the quote which is quoted here at church. You can pick the quote. You can get the message and read it because we're not going to come and read the whole book before you. But we interest you that you go back. Why have I spent a lot of time on the message feast of the trumpet? You take time and say let me go and read it from the beginning. Praise the name of Lord. Take it and read it from the beginning. About 44 pages within two three hours you'll be done. Praise the name of the Lord. Let us go back and dig the message. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. The time maybe you are spending on your phone. Maybe every day you're spending seven hours, 10 hours or whatever hours. How much do you spend not on Facebook but on the message facing it reading your Bible? Praise the name of our Lord because God has given us this message. Brother Brham was reading books. He would see visions but he read. How about us? Praise the name of the Lord. I had to read. I had to study and then write. Then he was telling Timothy study to show yourself approved. Now reading is not for the ministers only. Even you can read read if you can't read here. Praise the name of the Lord. So the message calls out the elect into the union with the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of the Lord. I believe I should stop here. May God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let us sing that song as we can. Each of us pray. Christ our redeemer died on the cross. God bless you. On Sunday we have two services. So remember that and the Lord's supper song number 34. Christ our redeemer died on the cross. Die for the sinner. Paid all his due. Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the lamb and I will pass. I will pass over you. And now I see the blood. Now I see the blood. Hallelujah. When now I see the blood. I will pass.

Oh, when I see [music] the life, I see the life of Christ. When I When I see that light, when I see [singing] his love, I will pass. I will pass over you. Each of us can speak to the Lord. Father, how we thank you, heavenly father, that you've called us out of confusion. You've called us out of Babylon. You've called us out of organized religion. How we thank you, Father, for the message that has gone forth. The message of the hour, Lord, that calls out out of blindness. And what a day we're living in that we live in the blind, Lord, this year. Oh God, be gracious unto us where the word has been put aside for organizations. The word has been put aside for traditions. The word has been put aside for other things. And the Holy Spirit has been put aside for systems, oh God, of religions. We pray you may help us, heavenly father, that we may live to your word because &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Happy. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Let us close with a word of prayer.

We pray, heavenly father, you've called us out of organized religion. May you help us, Father, that Christ may be fully formed in us, Father. And you may help us every day that we live. We may live, heavenly father, seeking your face, waiting upon you, Lord, feeding on this word, Father, even as you said in your word, that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. you may help us father to have that hungering and thirsting every day that we may hear the voice of God for this end time and help us to be ready for the rapture. How we love you and how we thank you Lord. Father we pray you may grant us travel to our mercies as each of us travels back home to our places of abboard. Meet all the needs of your children Lord. We pray for those who are sick and afflicted that you may heal them. Help our brothers and sisters who are doing examinations. Give them grace to excel in the examinations. and thanking for the children who came back from school. We pray may help them also in this holidays to know you father in the power of your resurrection. Bless us and be with every one of us. Until we meet again on Sunday, Lord, may your grace watch over us and bring us again in the services of the Lord. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask this. Amen. God bless you so much. You are dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us sing that song. I was sinking deep in sin. Love lifted me as we go out. I was sinking deep [singing] in sin, far from the peaceful shore. Well, deeply stand within, [singing] [music] sinking to rise no more.
