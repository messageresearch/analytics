afternoon the grace that you've given unto us Lord come again in your presence you said where all three are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst and Lord we believe you're here in our midst and our desire Lord draw us nearer to the Lord and you may reveal yourself to us you may manifest yourself to us and guide us in the path that we have to take we commit now this service into your hands that Lord may come and speak to us the things concerning our marriage give us Grace Heavenly Father be able to be obedient to your word in The Obedience of your word that's where we can find joy and peace commit service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let us go to Luke chapter 15 and then we're reading from verse 8 to verse 10 Luke 15 verse 8 verse 10 so the Bible says either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and strip the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she has found it she calleth her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost likewise say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repentance may God bless of his word you may be seated praise the name of our Lord I want to preach on the subject seeking that which is lost in your marriage seeking that which is lost in your marriage now this Parable we have read talks about a woman who had 10 pieces of silver now now these 10 pieces of silver in the customs of the Jews or the way the Jews were living they were put in a tablet you know something like they put around on top of the head and that tablet had 10 pieces of silver and now each of those 10 pieces represented a certain virt for that woman and so now this woman lost one piece of Silver And now when she lost it that implied that there is a virtue that she had lost maybe it would reflect that there's something but in her marriage so now she had nine she has lost one but she diligently s that lost silver praise the name of our Lord now in the message the second coming of the Lord then he says we find this woman her husband had gone and she had lost one of the coins out of her tablet now I will try to explain that today if a woman is married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married that is to keep other man from having anything to do with her they look and they see she's a married woman in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet and you know they call it a tablet they put it on their head and it had 10 coins and it went around their head and that was a sign that they were a married woman and no man was to fool with them no boy was to fle with them they were married each one of those coins if we have only time but I haven't I'm going to try to my okay said I could tell you what each of those coins meant it was placed in there and each coin meant a certain virtue of that woman the first meaning of her love to the husband the second pledge to to over to live clean for him uh and the third and fourth andth nth and 10th praise the name of our Lord so now we see that this woman had lost one coin and you know that when we marry you find that you start as a happy couple you know everything seems to be doing well and you know until I remember there's a wedding meeting we had here I think I don't know how many years ago but I think it's before Corona and we're just in the Sunday school and then the brother said if anybody talks about her because the meeting was about to we that brother and the sister said I don't want to hear anything against her they were not yet waed but you see that kind of feeling for one another you know they're not yet married but one wouldn't want to hear anything against the other and even sometimes when people are in that kind of love you'll find that even if something is true about the person the other one's eyes are not seeing it I don't mind about whatever you say She's mine he is mine but now as time goes on they lose the coin now where does the coin go so we need to see that we seek that lost coin that first love that we had for one another that respect that we had for one another that feeling that we had for one another praise the name of our Lord you know like adult people you've never lived together but then you have confidence that you can live with this man you can live with this woman so close praise the name of the Lord so we need to Li sick for that lost coin praise the name of our Lord the Lost coins in our marriage maybe love has departed from our home submission has departed from our home peace has departed from our home Joy has gone from our home there is no more compassion there's no more fear of God there's no more Comfort whatever we have lost in our marriage we need to seek it praise the name of our Lord now we have a promise in Luke 11 and then verse 9 the Bible says and I say unto you ask and it will be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that ask receiveth and he that seeketh findeth unto him that knth it shall be open that's what the Bible say so now if you have lost anything seek for it pursue it seek it diligently praise the name of our like here is an interesting scenario to convince a woman to leave her parents home you you don't just wake up one morning and say tomorrow she's just coming it takes time to convince her and then she said ah this is the best person maybe the friend would ask are you sure that man is going to are you sure this is will happen and she is convinced Beyond doubt and then she comes to your place now you s her and then you able to convince her and then now you find that in some marriages things are upside down things are completely scattered there's no more joy there's no more peace why don't you do the same to bring that peace back which has praise the name of our Lord why don't you humble yourself that you know you can get back to that time the love that you had for one another the respect that you had for one another and so that's what this woman was doing she was seeking for that lost coin and so we also need to seek what we have lost in our marriage the love you had for your wife if is not there ignite it to come back praise the name of our Lord let it come back at least there are so many things know about yourself that can put you together the what can divide you praise the name of our Lord there are so many things that can draw you at time you didn't know much when you are just married but yet you had a lot of love you had a lot of feeling you had a lot of desire for one another and now that time has gone many things have happened the things you have done together let those things You' have been together and then the things you take interest in you together not what you don't agree but the things that you agree on praise the name of our you know it is very interesting there are some families where the husband does not talk with the wife if if the the husband wants anything uses the children if the wife wants anything uses the children now about when the child is Si is both your child what are you going to do and then there are those where they can't talk at all and when the child becomes sick that's when they try to feed it to come back should not be like that we shouldn't allow crisis to bring us together praise the name of our Lord how many crises are you going to have at to come together we shouldn't allow crisis to bring us together but let it be love of God that concern that feeling for one another praise the name of our Lord that we can get back together and live as a family so the Bible has told us seek and you shall find like this woman when she lost the coin the Bible says she swept around she kept checking every corner she didn't take anything for granted you know because when you are looking for something which is lost you don't know what where it has gone so she started turning things upside down she started checking here that should be the same thing we need to do praise the name of our Lord that we may seek that which is lost in our marriage and we restore it its position now still in that message the second coming of the Lord he says in paragraph 71 now she had a house cleaning time she scrubbed the floors she swept the walls she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now praise the name of the Lord that should be also the same thing seek that which you have lost in your and see that you restore it see that you bring it back see that you put it in its position for the goodness of your marriage praise the name of our Lord if love is not there restore love seek why isn't love in your marriage why isn't submission in your marriage why why isn't compassion in your marriage praise the name of our Lord you know see that you your marriage is a happy marriage because that's why God put it because in the scriptures he says it is not good for man to be alone I will make him a help meet I help me praise the name of our Lord and I've always believed with all my heart that the person you marry is the best person there is ever so don't start thinking maybe I wish I had got the other one maybe I wish I would change to this other person you may get a worse than that so learn how to bear with one another learn how to church the person that God has given you whatever differences are there even you have nonel husbands or wives she's the best wife you can get's the best husband you can get so don't go around Corners I wish he was a Believer oh I wish he was a Believer that's the best person the Lord has given you and then you cherish them praise the name of the Lord you cherish them because at that time that's the decision you make praise the name of our Lord and marriage is until death so you're not going to say let me pray for this one to die to get another where will Christ be now praise the name of our Lord no they changing not even changing so then you Church the one God has given you and say Lord I Thank you for this wife Lord I Thank for my husband and then you say how you can live together the differences that you may have you learn to bear with one another in their difference praise the name of Lord even if he goes to another church or he goes to another religion still is the best husband or the best wife and you keep on cherishing them and as you live the life of Christ you may be able to win that person to Christ praise the name of our Lord and that's how the Lord wants us to do you know marriage is Honorable in if you married whenever God hon if you mared and you is your husband or your wife that so you learn to bear with that praise the name of our Lord marriage is Honorable in all so if you have made that decision be able to stand with it not again saying I made a mistake the other time now I can change praise the name of our Lord marriage is Honorable in all praise the name of our Lord you know there was a Catholic priest in the US and then he married and then people are criticizing why did he marry when he to Mar then brother told them marriage is Honorable in all as long as he not in adulter God Honors that praise the name of our so then we need to see that we seek that which is lost in our marriage let us go to Ephesians 5: 21 Ephesians 521 the scripture says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God praise the name of our Lord submitting giving an ear to one another communicating with one another praise the name of our in the fear of God not an issue whereby you can't even talk with one another you can't hear one another you can't give truth to the other what they saying the Bible says submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God wife submit yourselves and your own husbands as unto the Lord praise the name of our Lord because as a husband the Bible says is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of of the church is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject un Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now as a wife be submissive to your husband that's why the Bible says unto the Lord as unto your lord like Sarah she was calling Abraham my Lord Abraham was her head and now we are living in times of emancipation but you see the Bible says wife submit yourselves to your husband that's your position and your submission is your security praise the name of our Lord your submission is your security you know a home cannot have two heads because Which side will it take praise the name of our Lord there has to be one head so as a wife learn to be submissive to your husband even the things you don't agree with see how you can politely express yourself not me I will not do that praise the name of the Lord but be how you can be humble and me and sometimes you know if you are told something you think may not work be humble enough the other part is not agreeing let us do it praise the name of the Lord you know there are different ways of doing different things praise the name of and not getting stuck in your corner this it can't work out like that praise the name of our Lord so as a wife have that virtue of submission if that kind of submission is lost seek it praise the name of the because your it's your protection and this how the Lord has ordained it to praise the name of our then in verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that's what the Bible saying if you are a husband love your wife praise the name of our Lord do everything you can expressing your love to your praise the name of the Lord not again taking kind of you know sful decisions you know hurting one another repeating an issue the other day you did this this day you did this that should not be the thing at home but let because the Bible says love covers a multitude of sins love covers a multitude of weaknesses so if you love somebody you're not going to look at their weaknesses you're not going to stand strength on their weaknesses you're not going to continously choose the day you did this now yesterday you did this now again you being rebellious no praise the name of our Lord love the Bible says husbands love your wives you know these are the beginnings and we need to go back to the beginning of our marriage that love that care that concern praise the name of our Lord so he says husbands love your wives wives submit to your husband praise the name of our Lord and that's how God wants us to see that we operate our marriages your marriage being operated based on the love of God praise the name of our Lord not on what we read maybe on infection you know novels or fings different things where we get influences from but the word of God has been proved praise the name of our Lord and that's why our protection is praise the name of our Lord let us go to First pter 3 first chter 3 and then verse 4 the Bible says but let it be the hidden man of of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price now the Bible is saying the adorning of the wives you know it should be a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God great price praise the name of our Lord that sweet spirit let let the sweet spirit of God be around you you know you know Adon with that grace of God praise the name of our you know Adon with that kind of fear of God praise the name of the Lord you know not like you know I I remember when I was in too there was a certain politician and she was representing a certain Village and the other one was known when she starts talking ah she had a husband who was a medical doctor but that home you would wonder how it was running anything she didn't have respect of any Authority no wonder sometime later the husband also slapped somebody so it was such a family but so you would wonder why is that me and quiet Spirit the fear of God the respect for another but then you see that the home is totally out of order praise the name of our Lord that should not be our homes we shouldn't take those kind of spirits you know where you hold Grudge you know something against somebody and you cannot let it go praise the name of the Lord but there should be a me and quiet Spirit which is of great which is a great price in the sight of God and then the Bible says after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adored themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands praise the name of the Lord be reflected in our heart wives being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement praise the name of our Lord you know you are looking at how holy women in the Bible behaved this is what the Bible wants us to take also so if you have lost a coin of subjection you need to seek that and restore it in its position praise the name of our Lord then verse seven likewise ye husbands with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being ha together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered praise the name of our Lord he says give honor give respect don't brush their ideas don't brush off what they doing and ignore Dem them or lower them or step upon them you don't do that but then you have respect one for another praise the name of our Lord this is what the Lord wants in our families God wants peace in our homes God wants respect in our homes God wants love in our homes God wants submission in our homes so what is that which is lost in your home and then you seek and see that it is found SE that it is restored praise the name of our Lord but why would your marriage be a hard journey every day is difficult coming home is hard praise the name of the Lord you know there are people who find Joy with their colleagues at place of work but when they come home grooming that should not be that it should be that you find Joy at home you find Comfort at home the travs you had at a place of work when you come home you are able to share and then you pray together and then you encourage one another so when you raise up in the morning you are stronger than when you came last night but again when you come home the night may be too long start wondering or you can keep yourself busy praise the name of the Lord you know there are some families where everything it's so silent as if there are no people at home when the husband comes home he keeps himself busy with newspapers even when they go to eat he doesn't talk or he doesn't they don't don't eat together I put food on the table okay such kind of homes or maybe when there is sports like maybe football that's when the man can look himself and shout and then the wife is busy there maybe bothered with the children the other one is the other side or maybe the wife she comes home with assignments you know I'm busy doing this class work doing this assignment program when it comes going to time for going to bed when the other one is in bed the other is busy and then some of them they make timbles sure that when this one is at home the other is at a place of work when the other one comes home the other one goes out deliberately what a home until you get the whole week they either meeting once or only maybe picking the children from school and their strangers want to that's not the home that the Lord wants us to praise the name of our Lord but we need to see that how we can relate with one another and then the Bible says in verse 8 finally be all of One mind having [Music] compassion one of another praise the name of our having compassion in other words you take the other one's burden to be your burden you are considerate enough you are concerned about the fear of your husand are concerned about the fear of your wife and when somebody says please this is my condition you take concern as if it is yourself not exploiting the other or pushing the other against yourself but being concerned about one another and then the Bible says love as brethren e every day at least they get time to say that they talk with one another and sometimes they talk when it's night when there's no interference the Sleep goes away because I'm expecting the call from how about now that you're together ah she does this and this she does this and this but we need to see that that moment comes praise the name of our Lord where you are the best of friends all your secrets you're telling your wife all your secrets you're telling your husand you know when you were away this is what happened this is what happened this what happened and take joy praise the name of there is a brother who was preaching on online and now he had a girlfriend girlfriend but even if he's preaching there you may only find one person and that will be the girlfriend listening she was the best fan of that person when others are not there for tune to listen just hearing preaching you be a f of the other praise the name of if your wife this be there to cheer her if your husband likes this be there to cheer this praise the name of Allah when you standing with one another they take interest in this when if maybe is what is this there what can I do to help you what can I do to help this even get something new ideas this has come this has happened and then you can see how you can see that you know you keep on having things in common praise the name of our Lord being another's kind of like f you know you just there to cheer praise the name of our Lord like now these footballers they have people they know that at least that corner that's where my girlfriend is sitting when they score they just want to run to that place praise the name of because they they are sure they going to be celebrated and even the husband should celebrate the wife even the wife should celebrate the husband but now if the husband has got an achievement and he's so happy of what he has and the wife says Ah that's not his strength what a home if maybe the wife has readed hard she's going to be you know she's going to be [Applause] crowned she wasted my money what a home but then you need to see that you celebrate one another praise the name of our Lord rejoicing together being compassionate about one oh God has given my wife this I want to Rejoice with her God has given my husband this I want that's the home we should have whereby you are having that feeling for one another her success is your success the husband success is your success you know you are now happy praise the name of our Lord but you see in the Villages and those people don't are God when the man gets more money more wives but that should not be so praise the name of our Lord that should not be so or if the wife works on herself so well men are going to dist it should not be like that praise the name of our Lord we need to have that kind of love for one another that kind of feeling for one another something that can put us together praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us let us have compassion one for another praise the name of our Lord let us continue to verse n not rendering evil for evil oring foring but contr wise blessing knowing that you are there un that you may inherit a blessing praise the name of the Lord if your wife does you wrong or your husband does you wrong you don't pay back but you have that compassion praise the name of our Lord and then you bless as we T in the morning praise the name of our Lord you bless one another you wish the other have good will for your husband have good will for your wife PR the name of our Lord if there's something they starting or struggling to do something stand behind them to help have that good will be a support to one another encourage one another but again not you to fail them or to defeat them or to frustrate them praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no gu let him rescue evil and do good let him seek peace and praise the name of our Lord he said seek that which is good and when you get it let it come out of you produce it pra brother wasting to pieces of silver to the fruit of the spirit in Galatians 5 and verse 22 and then this scripture says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law praise the name of our Lord so we need that we have the fruit of the spirit as an individual in your life praise the name of the Lord the holy spirit in you will will give you Grace in every change that you're going praise the name of our Lord he will give you Grace regardless of the challenge whether the other party doesn't understand or whatever the spirit of Christ will come and give you the right way of handling such an issue how to handle such a situation that you're going through praise the name of our Lord so we need say that we have the spirit of Christ we say that we bear the fruit of the spirit and let that fruit be manifested in our praise the name of our Lord you can't hide the fruit but let it be manifested let it be seen let it be seen at our let it be seen by our children let it be seen by your husband let it be seen by your wife praise the name of our Lord you know he say that when the woman loses a piece of silver that which is lost and we also need to seek that which is lost praise the name of our Lord now as I finish let us go to proverbs 31 praise and name of our Lord proverbs 31 and then verse 10 he says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above r praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is talking about being a virtuous woman virtuous wife the you as a wife you are the one who makes the home praise the name of our Lord your hands your character praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says who can find that virt the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not Evil all the days of her [Applause] life inse strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in the time to come she opens her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness looks well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idess her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also he Praises her praise the name of our Lord we need to have virtuous wives at home or as a wife be a virtuous one praise the name of our Lord and as a husband be a husband with the mind of Christ praise the name of our Lord there was no man with such a characters of Christ but if we can yield ourselves to Christ we shall have the mind of Christ we shall have the character of Christ knowing the right thing to do at the right praise the name of our Lord now if you have lost any virtue if you have lost any value for your marriage as a husband or as a wife no more loving your hus nor more submitting to your husband praise the name of our Lord you need to seek that and let it be restored praise the name of our Lord in Isaiah 4 then verse 31 Isaiah 4031 the Bible says but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen praise the name of the Lord wait on the Lord commit your marriage to the hand of the Lord whatever challenge you have raise it in the hand of the Lord call upon the Lord to come down in your praise the name of our Lord that the Lord may come down in your marriage like when Isaac had challenges in his marriage he waited on the Lord and the Lord was ined when Rebecca was not knowing what was happening in her womb she waited on the Lord and the lord gave an answer praise the name of our Lord when there was confusion between Abraham
