That day he set me free and made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I live to praise his name. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see who I am. I'm part of my Savior. I'm part of his word. His revelation predestination [Music] of who I am. On Calary, he died to redeem his Lord's pride. The king of kings became my savior. This is God's grace mystery of love expressed to me that Christ had done my one. &gt;&gt; Who am I then? &gt;&gt; I am Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh I am Lord. Oh, I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can see now. &gt;&gt; I can see. &gt;&gt; Lord, I can see now who I am. I'm part of my Savior. I'm part of this world. It's a revelation predestination of who I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, who I am. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Lord, I can see now. &gt;&gt; I can see. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can see now. I am &gt;&gt; the my savior of his world. He's a revelation predestination of who I am. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation. destiny nation of who I am. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aina, &gt;&gt; do you love him? &gt;&gt; We're in his presence. &gt;&gt; And to know who you are before him &gt;&gt; is a revelation. purely revelation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to welcome all of you into the presence of the Lord. And there are certain small things that always God allows. Amen. &gt;&gt; To kind of confirm that he is in the environment. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just don't know why &gt;&gt; I was thinking about you &gt;&gt; and yesterday I said why don't I call him and say I've not seen him in a long time and I knew that if I called he would say I will come but he's there you know those are things that God allows &gt;&gt; sometimes to tell you I'm not far from you Amen. So, it's a blessing to be in his presence every Sunday morning. And some of the people that have been so zerous, Amen. for the last 40 years. Amen. The older they became is the more they've held on like Amen. Brother, Alex. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not in it, you know, simply because it's good time. Sometimes it's been hard, but they've held on so many hours, brother Fred, you know, when he said he was going to stay in, I wondered how he would be able to be in services all the time. But the Lord has given him grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; To keep driving about 60 kilome to this not once, not one year, not years. Amen. So we appreciate God for people that have made a commitment and they will not fail on that commitment. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see when I go out there sometimes I appreciate the culture of the white people. &gt;&gt; When a white decides to say I have believed that is final. That's final. If they don't play about their commitment. Amen. Yeah. So, you know, we want to see men and women who have made real commitments like Ruth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, she says, "Your people will be my people." Amen. Where you die. Where you be, I will be buried. Amen. And then you break the bridges behind you. meaning that you are not going to go back into the former convictions you had. So we appreciate all of you that have kept faithful and you are here all the time, some 40 years, some 20 years, some 10 years, and even those of you have been around for 5 years. you know years keep moving. Amen. I don't remember how many years but even uh brother here is almost moving 20 years I think. It's like he came yesterday. Amen. It's a comfort to the ministry to keep seeing the faces he has always seen. Plus Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Our sister, &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Since you left tomorrow, you have been faithful. God bless you so. Amen. Amen. So, uh, our pastor is not here today. He's in with brother Pastor George Franklin. &gt;&gt; Franklin got here yesterday &gt;&gt; and very late. You know, the plane kept saying in the next 2 hours he was supposed to arrive at 10:00 in the morning, 2 in the morning, then 6:00 in the I mean in the evening rather until he got here at 8:00 in the evening. So, they got to the pastor's house at around 2:00 in the morning. Amen. Amen. I told the pastor, I've been doing this for the last 40 years. Now, these are your visitors. Amen. Amen. That's what it means to retire from the rest of Do you love him this morning? You just take your burdens onto him. He cares for you. Today we've had a question and uh the question is who am I? Amen. This the one we are going to try to answer this morning and we shall keep by the grace of God as the Lord keeps giving me grace to deal with the subject of who am I. You know when you know who you are and you catch a revelation of who you are, it is strengthening. It is establishing. It's encouraging. Amen. You know I'm in this journey between me and my father. Amen. Not between me and my brother. If my brother falls out, I'm falling out. You are in this because you were called by Godated seed. Amen. It's a blessing to know that. Let's stand up and get into the scripture reading this morning. We shall go to the book of John chapter one. Amen. Amen. Uh before we read the scripture, let's have a word of prayer. Precious heavenly father, we give thanks and known to you. Father, for giving us grace this morning to come before your presence, Lord, in your presence, we've got answers to all questions. We've got, Father, dear Lord God, the supply of all our needs, find comfort in the time of trouble. Find the peace, Lord. We find the joy in times of sadness. Father, this is a house of correction, a house of instruction, a house where we rejoice together. Father, you've done a lot of good for us. We are getting into the sharing of the word. I pray that you may break it to us that it may become life, Father, that it may encourage us in the end times. Lord, when everything is going wrong, help us Lord to know who we are that we may act as those who have got a revelation of God in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So John 1 verse 19 it says and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou who art thou? May the Lord have blessing the reading of his word. you may be seated. So you know they sent people from Jerusalem to ask him who he was and he confessed and denied not but he confessed I am not the Christ. He could not take another man's position because he knew we were. Amen. He would not want to be in the greater position. When God puts a man in a position, he makes that man know his position and makes that man rejoice in his position. And they asked him, "What then art thou? Yes." And he says, I am not. Art thou that prophet? He answered, "No." Then said they unto him, "Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us?" What sayest thou of thy soul? Now &gt;&gt; he said, &gt;&gt; "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah." So we are answering the question, who am I? And all of us many times have questions as on to who we are before God. So we all certainly in another life here on earth we have earthly identities. Earthly identities and some of that we are proud of it and some of it we are even ashamed of it. They will know you as so and so son and sometimes your father was the least in the village. So you don't have such a status and sometimes you'll be identified by the wealth you hold or by the fame you hold. Fame. Fame. Amen. So there is a way each one is known in this present world we whoever we are there is a way we are known and many times the people don't refer us by our names they refer to you by the status you know they just call that Mawa's place That's what they call brother William on the many people don't know his name but they say oh that doctor's place in the scriptures men were usually referred to you know by their status many times and sometimes the people who are not born again They are very very you know happy being referred to by the good status that governor or M or that rich man. You see they they appreciate that. And even in the Bible there were men that were referred to by their status. You would find statements like the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plate flesh. And now another one is there was a certain rich man which had a steward. There was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen. And there was a certain noble man whose son was seeking. There was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man. You know they were being referred to by their status. Amen. As a son of God, I wouldn't want to be referred to by my status. Who am I? Amen. So they are famous persons whose names are even rarely mentioned. When they in the community, they start calling them Mr. President. Sir, &gt;&gt; Mr. President you know they are referred to by the status. So we do what we do or you know how we live our lives gives us a legacy in life and maybe a famous legacy in you know or an infamous legacy. Amen. Amen. So what do you want to be remembered for? because you are a child of God and then you want to have a mix of certain other stuff. What would you want to be remembered for? To be remembered as an unstable Christian to be remembered as a kid to be you remembered as a corrosome woman. What would you want to be remembered for? You know, there are some people that are going to leave this earth and they would tell stories about them. But every Sunday, from when I was a child up to when I grew, I'm now 50. I've always seen that man carry his Bible. on Sunday going to church that he never missed a service. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; I want to be remembered by that legacy. Amen. Would you want to be remembered for sowing discord among the brethren? You wouldn't be remembered for such a legus. Somebody say amen. You want to be remembered by something that will be good that even if people don't know your name when they point to that house, they say that's the pastor's house. Are you together with me? Amen. So sometimes in the scriptures, men who mattered much, their names were mentioned in the scriptures. Those who mentioned much before God, they had names mentioned. And some others people who were famous here on earth, the scripture just says there was a rich man. There was a noble man. But when we go to the book of Luke chapter 16 and verse 19, there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen. And he faed somely every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus. Are you together with me? The other man who was rich is mentioned by his wealth. But this man here who feared God, he has his name in the lamb's book of life. Even if he was a beggar, God call him by name. Who am I this morning? Amen. Amen. So going by this parable, you could be poor, but if you have lived right, you will always be remembered by your name. Amen. You'll always be remembered by your name. If my legacy is negative this morning, I'd rather repair it now that I could be remembered for a Christian who straightened his work. Amen. If it's a crooked walk, I would rather repair it now that I may be remembered as a Christian who repaired this Christian work. I want you to remember that we have got the blood constant with us. &gt;&gt; I want you to remember these two things as you live your life. You should know you were saved by grace. Amen. You had done nothing whatsoever. But grace came your way because you predestinated of God. But after grace you are kept by the blood. Amen. Every morning keep taking whatever is negative and the blood allow God to wash you. Keep you in a walk after you have left. you will be remembered for the person who care to put everything under the blood. Amen. So so many people today when they join church they just become drifters. Amen. So we don't want to do that. We want to be people that have come to a place and we don't drift. We are not drifters from church to church without purpose and direction. Amen. So you know brother remember him saying what a horrible thing. You know when he was talking about uh the uh voice of many water and then he says those voices &gt;&gt; were the voices of the minister. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? They were voices of the minister. Amen. They were like the voices of many waters. But when God calls a man, it pleases God to place him in an in a particular Yes. which is the church so that this person here can have a watch, can have a shift, can have somebody watch over him. And if you do not have a person to watch over you, you know, brother Brandham would worry over you. He says, "What a horrible fear or a drifting soul of the sea of life, no pilot to guide him. Lose floaty with the taring the row of the great cataract. [Applause] What a horrible thing it would be to a drifting soul. Amen. If you was a Christian, if God calls you, stand and make a legacy. [Applause] Are you together with me? Yeah. You leave a legacy and you say God have mercy upon me that I may stand right. I want a people that are going to be looked for and the address is permanent. The address is permanent. But when you say is in this church, then that church in that church are drifting. So, amen. But you need to stand and say, "Lord, here I am." And I'm going to be counted here. If I'm the tribe of Judah, I cannot become Benjamin. Are you together with me? Yes, sir. If I'm Benjamin today, I cannot become tomorrow. Amen. If I'm Judah, I'm Judah. And if they are looking for me, there is a tribe where they can find. Yes sir. That's how we can have a strong church. Amen. Amen. We should settle and be pased rather than drifting on the Cadillac. The voice of the ministers from pastor to pastor we must find a solid ground in our local church. Amen. This is now pastoral teaching. Amen. Everybody must know who I am. You should answer your question. Who am I? Brother says, "We don't dress up to lay around lay around a corner and flat with girls. Amen. Amen. We train our army to fight. [Laughter] So when you come here, you know that you are being trained to handle something. You are here to be trained. But if they send some from Jerusalem and say, "Who are you that we may send a report back to those who are ready?" John was ready. He knew he was. go from the pulpit to the pew. We must fight anything to stay in our legacy as Christians. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. So I want the blood of the lamb. [Applause] [Music] Amen. And as I walk, praise God. They can trail me. They can try to see who I am. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I want us to really be, you know, people. If the Lord can help me to put this right, who have discovered who they are? My legacy should not be there was a certain rich man. No sir, my legacy should have a name to it. And his name was Lazarus. Praise God. So let us define a name here which we have done a few times. And I said that a name has something to do with the divine assignment. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Sometimes our mothers or fathers, they give us names that are negative and those names sometimes influence what we do because if they give you a name and your name is you wouldn't want to be defeated. grow up with that in the mind. If your name is you don't want to be found that you are the most forome woman. There is a way these names influence us. Are you together with me? Yes sir. Your names have something to do with the divine assignment. We shall go into the book of Matthew chapter 1 and verse 21. The Holy Spirit says about Jesus, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. What the name Jesus about? He shall save his people from their sin. giving him a name that identifies his divine assignment is to be a savior of his people. So the name Jesus defined a divine assignment. But then the question is who am I? And what's my divine assignment? What's my divine commission? If I came from God, I did not come here on earth to be, you know, some kind of a decoration. Amen. So that the people who look at me would look at how handsome I am and would look at how I walk. No, there is something more. You are here if you came from God and divine assignment. Amen. Let us go into the book of Genesis chapter 17 verse 5. Now he's talking to Abraham &gt;&gt; and he says, "Neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham, but thy name shall be called Abraham." In that name is the assignment to be a father of many nations. Are you together with me? So the commission is defined by the name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So a name is your divine assignment from God, your divine character, your divine nature. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now I'm not talking about your name which was given by your father. I'm talking about your new name, which is not actually new because that's what you were before the foundation of the world. Your name defines your engagement in divine things. Are you together with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the name Abraham the divine commission to be a father of nations. So as I come and you know confess the Lord Jesus Christ and then I I'm saved and I'm baptized. I receive the bapt of the Holy Ghost. When the bas of the Holy Ghost touches my life, the baptism of the Holy Ghost becomes a tutor, a teacher to train me into my divine assignment. Praise the Lord. How can I get to know what my new name is? My divine assignment in the body of Christ. It is hidden in the white stone. Are you together with me? Because a stone is something to do with revelation. Thou art Peter and upon this rock, meaning upon the revelation of the word. For in the word is your name, it is hidden in there. So to discover who you are, you need to bury yourself in the word. As you bury yourself in the word, you are going to know who you are and you don't know yourself as Moses because it's your parents who gave you that. You are defined by a holy character that God embeds in your life. Amen. And as your character begins to change and working the things of God, that's the name. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation chapter 2 and verse 17. He that has an ear, meaning he that has got the ability to hear from God by revelation, let him hear what the spirit says that the church. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manner, and will give him &gt;&gt; a white stone. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the stone, &gt;&gt; a written a name written is not written on the stone. is written in the stone and the stone is the revelation of Christ you amen and that revelation comes from here. So basically the Bible in a way is the stone and in is where you find your new name. So as you keep studying the word it keeps influencing your life and causing you to do certain divine assignments. You give up certain things in life. And as you keep doing like a you are living the life that God ordained before the foundation of the world for you to live. Let me tell you something. When men received the Holy Ghost, there are seven on record. There are seven men on record. Amen. One of them is Paul and then we've got all the others like &gt;&gt; then we've got Martin. &gt;&gt; Then we've got Cola. &gt;&gt; Then we've got Martin Luther. &gt;&gt; Then we've got Wesley. &gt;&gt; And we also have William brother. &gt;&gt; Seven men. &gt;&gt; Now the seventh &gt;&gt; was able to know who you are. &gt;&gt; But the first six They did what they did and they didn't know who they were. It's only Malachi 4 tells us who they were. But their name was the divine assignment which we call them by as messengers. God help me to bring this out. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden man and will give him a white stone and in a new I mean and in the stone a new name which no man knoweth saving it that receiveth it. is a name which is personal holder. No man can take that name. No man can take that character because it's a divinely assigned by God to lead this person to live his life for the purpose of the gospel in a certain way. Amen. So an overcomer that overcomes the selfwill, God gives him a hidden manner. There was the public manner which was picked up by everybody and it was good enough for the dead. But then there was hidden mana which was in the holy of holies. Praise the Lord. He says, "He that overcome, I'll give him to eat of the hidden man. I accept him in the inner veil." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I accept him in the inner fail. He'll be locked behind the the noise of the public. And then I'm going to have fellowship with him. And now as I have fellowship with him, what I speak to him will be hidden manner. And it is hidden in this book. Hallelujah. So we outgive ourselves to the study of the word so that God can speak to us about who we are. Amen. God don't speak to us about who we are. Amen. And then he says even as he is in here, he's going to discover his name as he keeps himself in the word. Now we have known what we mean by name. A divine assignment. your commission in the body, your position in Christ, you cannot discover it when you keep yourself away from the world because that's where your divine commission is hidden. Amen. So now let me tell you something that there was mana which came down and everybody had ability to collect but then there was man which was kept in the secret special for special men and you want to become one of the special people learn to go into the holy of holies. Amen. So now this man which we are talking about comes down as logos the word in the age which you live and this man here which is the word is broadcast to all and everybody who has ears can hear it but the elect. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. When he hears together with the others gets a hidden portion, a man which is assigned to him individually to transform his life and that's what you call the rem which is the position of revelation which is assigned to you personally. the personal portion of the revealed word and that's where you can find your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; It shapes you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, yeah." &gt;&gt; At the end of this service, if we ask people to come forward and they start saying something about what they say and all of you will be totally saying something different. God deals to every man according to the way he has called it. Are you together with me? Yeah. According to the way God has called this, brother Brandham says it also says here that he's going to give the overcomer in the PGA church. is going to give the overcomer a white stone and in not on the white stone a new name which the owner alone knows that owner receives the joy of serving a certain way because God deals with him on that level. Amen. Nobody will force him that we didn't see you singing this morning because it's on him. It is honored in his life. Is his own name. He has got a joy. Are you together with him alone? You know, nobody will tell him don't miss the I mean the overnight because this man here Jesus call upon his life. Amen. You are not going to blame anybody because maybe this man is God in another area and then God will put a call upon a man's heart to become a witness as we all testify. But this man has got a special call. It is a joy upon his life. He says And he's going to give the overcomer a white stone and in not on the stone a new name which the owner alone knows and knowing that a name signifies character. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the idea of a new name is a familiar one. Abraham &gt;&gt; was changed to Abraham. Sarai &gt;&gt; to Sarah, &gt;&gt; Jacob to Israel, Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul. from the name they were given, natural names to certain form of names which actually pointed to what God had called them to do. Are you together with me? So these names either brought a change or were given because of a change. It was only after Abraham and Sarah, they had their names changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son. In Jacob's case, he had to overcome and then he was called a priest. [Applause] In the case of Simon and Saul, when they had received the Lord, their change came. And today, each one of us, a true I mean uh true believers has had a change in name. We all have a change in name from Pentecost Assemblies of God, Pentecost Assemblies of God, from Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints or from whatever church that you could come to. You have now got a new name. We are Christians. And they were first called Christians &gt;&gt; in Antioch because they were like Christ. So their character gave them a name. I think you see where we are going. So but one day we will have another change. We will over certain receive a new name. It could well be that name was our true and original name written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world. He knows the name but we do not. one day at his good pleasure we will know also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to say that as we are here we all have a new name. It is in finding God's perfect will. Amen. For your life here on earth. So, and as you step into the opening of the word to your age with the bas of the Holy Ghost, you step into the manifestation of the name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The name is not just coming to us. The name is what you have always been before God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But when you receive the word, for your age and the bas of the Holy Ghost. It helps you to manifest that character. The name we are talking about. Amen. Praise the Lord. Listen to what brother Brandham says in the first city says. And it's only to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken. That name broken to who? &gt;&gt; Not to Christ but to the church. Notice now. Oh my. That just makes me tremble. &gt;&gt; I hope that the church truly understands. You people, I'm going to call you bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to call you. &gt;&gt; Now from church to bride, from church to bride. But then when you become a bride as an individual, you've got your personal character. You've got your personal character the way God designed you to live your life. We can never be uniform from there because we become the body of Christ. Sometimes the body you might be talking about a finger, sometimes you are talking about the arm. Sometimes you are talking about the ear, every one of these members special character. Are you together with me? Much as we are the new name as Christians and we've been promoted to being a bride, we must cut out a personal revelation to this message that adopts us in divine service and we refer to you as a person placed in the body. our placing in the body, your inheritance, your individual position in Christ. Are you together with me? Yeah. I want to tell you something here. Maybe I'm trying to bring you so close to the subject that you may be able to understand. Amen. As much as an inheritance as a part of Judah When he got into the land, he reminded Joshua which Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost. But remember, let me take you to Joshua chapter 14. He reminded Joshua that much as I am Judah, much as I am the bride, but there is a personal inheritance for me. Are you together with me? Yeah. Much as we are all given a new name. We are now the bride of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We are like now Judah. But out of Judah, out of you being a bride, there must be a calip element which has a personal inheritance. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you ask, &gt;&gt; give me my mountain, &gt;&gt; my mountain, my own mountain that we gave you as together as the give me. &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you going to ask for your mountain? &gt;&gt; Your position in the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Much as you are part of the body, but there must be a caliber position. The way God calls you, the way God works around you, the way God uses you. Amen. You must be identified. When they went to Job, he says, "I am one." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a voice of one man &gt;&gt; going in the wilderness. He understood that the Pharisees were not looking for his personal name, but the Pharisees were looking for the divine assignment. John had to tell them who he was by a divine assignment. What God had called him to do. Amen. Joshua chapter 14 and verse 10. And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive. This is Calb. As he said this 40 and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, and now, Lord, I am this day for school and 5 years. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. And my strength was as my strength was then even so is my strength now. for war to go and to come back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He says, I feel the same strength as when Joshua sent me as a spy. Hallelujah. To spy the land. Hey, he says, "I'm still strong enough to go to battle and to come back." He had an understanding of who you were and what he was. Praise the Lord. Now therefore, give me this mountain whereof the Lord spoke in that day. For thou hadest in that day how the anarchims well, and that the cities were great and fierce. If be so, the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him. and gave unto the son of Jeff Hebron for an inheritance. Moses come here. &gt;&gt; I want some four people volunteer please. Come and come here. One more person. Now &gt;&gt; I want to say this is Judah. And in Judah they've been given their inheritance, a land of their own. And now everybody is part of Judah. Are you together with me? But then out of Judah comes this and he says, "Much as we've got the general inheritance, but I want my personal. Give me my mouth. We are church. We are bride. That's our new name. We walk as a bride should walk. But this here He says on top of that, give me a new name. Give me a new character. Give me a new way of doing things. I'm not that I'm separating from Judah. I am Judah. But I feel there is something personal that I must possess. Amen. So you already here. &gt;&gt; You've been given a new name. You've been called church and out of church you can be called bride. Amen. Like all the others from being a bride. Who am I person? Who am I? What has God called me to do as an individual to sit in the church enjoy the services? Who am I? Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's when we talk about the age of we are talking about the age where all the people are recognizing who they are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I want to see this morning identifying themselves. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's go to a high octave here. So we are looking at personal inheritance here which I'm calling a personal name, a personal calling, a personal character, a portion of the word that identifies you as an individual gift to the body of Christ. Amen. Because you ate from the word to be identified as bread. Amen. It was given to us all. We are bread but yet in the bride you are there. What's your position of Christ? Who am I? This goes far above the titles we hold. Either pastor so and so so and so. This is God identifying you by your divine assignment that you did the B. Amen. It goes beyond the status we hold in each other. Hallelujah. Praise God. The Pharisees understood that God called men. The God called men were only known by given names. Amen. God given names. And these names were not John the son of Zechariah. No. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They wanted to see what is your divine assignment. What did God call you to do? What's your name? I &gt;&gt; I want to break this mystery here. Who are you? You are here, &gt;&gt; but who are you? You see much, let me tell you about Moses again that much as the vision of the tabernacle was given to Moses for him to bring that vision to manifestation. He needed men who had divine abilities given to them. Are you together with me? &gt;&gt; Moses was spiritual. &gt;&gt; Moses could speak to God. Moses could see visions. And he saw the vision. Amen. Of the tabernacle. So what? Moses is leading a nation which is a church. But then they needed men. that had the ability to bring to presence of manifestation the vision that Moses had seen. And that's why I said this morning the pastor needs you so much to build this church. You may you know he may have the vision. He may know what he wants to achieve. He cannot achieve it without special men assembly. Praise the Lord. Not just to be another church member. Praise the Lord. Who are you? Let's go to Exod 31 and look at what I'm saying. Do you like the teaching of the word? Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Exod 31:1, and the Lord said unto Moses, saying, he has already shown him the vision of the tabernacle. He has given him the measurement. He has given him the nature of the materials. But then God tells him among the men in the camp, among the men that are in the church, I have called by name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Meaning I have called with certain divine ability. Amen. The son of Yuri, the son of Y of the tribe of Judah. And I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of work of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To deise the coming works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones set them of timber to work in all man of work. So without the vision of Moses of the tabernacle could not come into existence without being anointed by the I mean to be anointed by the abilities of divining cunning works. After there were certain aspects of Moses tabernacle that could not come into existence. There is a reason why you are what you are in this local assembly and be found doing your part. If God called you to be a deacon, be honestly a deacon. Don't carry a title. There was a certain rich man. You should have a name attached to the practice of the office. Amen. If he has called you a trustee, if he has called you to be a song leader, he has not called you to come here and recite songs. You recite songs. You are called because you have got a certain special ability. Amen. Be faithfully found in your position and you are trading your talent even if you got what? That's what God has given. Tread it. Tread it. Amen. So, we've had this kind of background. So, let's go now to the scripture in John chapter one. Verse 19 where we were. And this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who art thou?" And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." because he knew what the Pharisees were looking. He says, "I'm not what you think. I cannot take another man's place. Are you together with me?" If we can be as honest as more I mean this man who was honest and you know God called me to be a deacon. There is no way I can be a pastor. We would have stable churches. If God has called you to be a song leader, there's no reason why you claim to go and become a deacon. He says, you know, he confessed. He denied not and said, I am not the Christ. That's not my position. God will always bless you when you find your position in the body. You don't take another man's place. And they asked him what then at thous you know those were great name but he could not take on those name in the body. Amen. And he said I am not at thou that prophet. And he said, "No, I'm not Malachi 4 that comes after grace. No, I'm not." And said they unto him, "Who art thou?" &gt;&gt; That we may give an answer to them that sent us thou of thy soul. &gt;&gt; He say, &gt;&gt; "I am." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who am I? We are not talking about natural names. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the character of the Holy Spirit in your life. Amen. Who are you? Are you a prayer warrior? Are you an apostle? Are you one who shows mercy? Are you out there to pray for people? &gt;&gt; What has God placed in your life? You see, he said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness." John knew his divine assignment. I am a voice of one crying from the wilderness. Amen. So each age had its message and he had its messengers and all through the time every age has packed its message with a messenger. God in every dispensation has sent forth some anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message every time. He packs them. He anoints them. He anointed in a special way. No man would try to do what he was doing. because it was supposed to be an anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; But out of the dispensation of voice to the earth, still God has heard some calyps who had the personal inheritance of what God was doing in that day. apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, God calling them and anointing them off of the message of the hour. Amen. Praise the Lord. And even as the ministers teach even their local churches, the same grace without anointing certain people. That's why Paul says having then gifts defering according to the grace that is given to us. Hallelujah. Then he says prophecy ministry like apostles. He says first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, evangelists, pastors. And then he says, "He that exaltth, he that giveth, he that ruleth, &gt;&gt; and he that even showeth mercy, &gt;&gt; all those that give, they only just drop off as anointings from the age. [Music] Amen. So let me give you some powerful statements from brother. Are you together with me? from the name then names I'll call you bride but out of there everybody has got a name has got a character has got a nature has got a commission has got a way the ghost uses Brother Brham says, "Now the thing for every individual to find is his place in God. What God has called you to do and then abide in that place." Okay? You take these little children who's been wandering from church to church and from place to place and positionally place them by the Holy Spirit tonight in their position in Christ. Then he says we all have different makeups. If we would just find our position in Christ and they abide and serve him, &gt;&gt; who am I? Lord help me. Who am I? Let's go to adoption message. He says, &gt;&gt; but the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ. Seeing that is not something that you just stumbled into or something that you might have merited somewhere, but it's what God did for you himself. Not that you were so good that you went to a church one night that some poor brother led you up to the altar. It wasn't there. It was God before the foundation of the world you to amen. So your divine assignment is what holds your new name. Find your position and abide like a John. He knew he was. I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness. Who am I? And yet you are something. But how can you know who you are? &gt;&gt; It's hidden in the word. &gt;&gt; Can I encourage you a little bit? &gt;&gt; Iranians didn't know he was. He just kept in the word and doing what he saw in the word. Martin didn't know he was. He just kept in the word and not doing what he said. And finally at the end they were identified by the eagle anointing when Malachi 4 paraded them and told us. So that's what you are just have faith as you study the word whatever the Holy Ghost is leading you do it faithfully. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do it faithfully knowing that is the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The Holy Spirit makes you a wife. Be a faithful one. There makes you a business manager. Be a faithful one. God bless you there. At the end of the day, your life will end up testifying to somebody. That's the way God work. Amen. Find your position and abide. John says, I am the voice of one. I am not imitating anyone. I am cut this way. That's what I am. I am a voice of one. I'm not an imitation, but I have found the will of God in my life. Can't you say amen to that? When you have found your position in Christ, God creates a special design in every elect so that they can operate a certain way. have called Bezar by name. Praise the Lord. No man will ever be like me. And there's nobody who has ever been like me. There's nobody who will be like you. And there's nobody who has ever been like one of us. In the Lamb's book of life have a special design. Amen. He designs your perception and perception is the way to see things a certain way. So he gives you a mind that thinks a certain direction special perception and by that perception you become a blessing to the body. Amen. So John the B said I am one. And therefore God dealt with him in a particular perception. He saw things in that direction. Therefore he said things in a certain way different from the rest of the people. He held views relevant to that season. That's what a call is, brother. Brother read something in the paper. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If there is a need of some kind, there will be somebody thirsty to fulfill that need. that circle you just see somebody step forward being anointed being capable doing certain things and you wonder but that's a call amen I'll give you a simple example here brother Brandham read a paper and he says uh in the message expect He says a year or two years ago where a little baby had eat the rasses of the pencil. He ate the pedals of a bicycle. They say what's the matter with the child? The doctor examined and take an analysis of this blood. and come out with a fine. He needed sulfur. Are you together with me? There's sulfur in rubber, a deep calling to the deep. See what I mean? If there is a call, there is a call here for self, there's got to be somewhere to respond for it. Are you together with me? If there is a need which I believe there are needs. Amen. The pastor was crying last Sunday about young people that should come up and be able to stand in certain gaps. We have gaps in this church. There's a deep and the other deep is you. Who am I? To every elect, there is a call that's general. as the bride of Christ. Amen. That's to live the life of being a Christian. As a bride, Christianity is our general inheritance. Like a caliber, the inheritance of Judah. But then out of Judah Calb steps up, give me my mouth. You see the message will make a lot of sense if we don't come to church just listen to the preacher. If back in our home, we are buried in the word, we listen to the tapes and we feed in a personal perspective, God reveals who you are. Amen. Amen. Now I want to paint a picture of a Christian. We have seen the picture of Judah. We want to paint a picture of what a church is where God is going to find some calip and assign them by his grace. Listen in invisible union. I want to name three things here that she must not get away from. Amen. Keep the church in mind. While I'm speaking to the natural woman, remember our last service on the bind behind the invisible union. She has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her. Nothing else holds it but a woman. She must not defile that party. We are trying to understand now the church body out of which God He's going to call a John the Baptist. He's going to call a Calip who understands his personal position. And he says she has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her. Then he says, "God gave her that virtue just as it was in the garden of Eden. She can say yes or no. She has a sacred trust of womanhood, committed to her that she must not break. The womanhood I'm speaking of here is her conduct. her character around men, not letting every man. Did you get that? &gt;&gt; So the bride is supposed to conduct herself jealously. She should be found being jealousy. Amen. guarding the position of her husband. Thus, the church is jealously guarding the position. A Christian has sacred trust in Christ. Men who have seen who they are and they protect. Amen. They don't take that into different wild ways of life. Amen. They don't go to the nightclubs. It is a sacred trust. Amen. She doesn't let every woman every man. She has a husband and that is Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. She has her husband and that's the work. She just doesn't let every man, every doctrine, every organization, she has a sacred trust. You have a sacred trust. Yeah. I'm trying to show you now the kind of inheritance, the nature, the character of the bride. out of that pride. Then God begins to anoint Calbs for particular services. Amen. Now he says some of these women looks on the screens and see these movies stars kissing and hugging and sloping around over these women. I mean sloping around. You know over these women a woman that does that is of a bad character. So a true housewife should not spend time on those you know films. [Music] No sacred trust. &gt;&gt; That's the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because without which they pick a spirit from it, but you are consecrating yourself for the service of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Yeah. Now keep the church in mind. She's kissing and slopping and messing around in everything else. But the word letting the devil and education and scientific searches and so forth. and it takes you away. You spend your time far from the voice of your husband. You don't have fellowship with him to identify yourself with him. Amen. So there was sacred trust and the second character is sacred womanhood. So sacred womanhood must not be discredit discredited. Praise the Lord. So the natural woman Just like the bride of Christ must guide her character. Her body must be carried in honor. Her way of dressing must respect her body. There's a form of dressing that does not belong for a Christian woman. And when we talk about this dressing, we are talking about the dressing of the word. You are properly dressed by the garments of his promised work. Are you together with me? You don't just go and get anything which describes you as a wife of Christ. Listen, Proverbs chapter 7 verse 4. Solomon is advising his son. If you happen, you know, say amen somewhere. Amen. Amen. Verse four says, "Say unto wisdom, thou art my sister, and call understanding thy kins woman, that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flatterth with her word." For at the window of my house, &gt;&gt; I looked through my casemate, and I beheld among the simple ones. I descended among the youth a young man void of understanding. passing through the street near her corner. And he walked the way to her house, in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night. And behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a prostitute and still at heart. That woman did not have sacrih. Amen. &gt;&gt; The is so bad to her character. short, &gt;&gt; tight, transparent, lower to the front, &gt;&gt; bad in everything. &gt;&gt; Bad in everything. And yet Solomon says, "Praise the Lord. She had the attire of a prostitute. &gt;&gt; God have mercy. On the way we adorn ourselves &gt;&gt; in the promised word of this hour that we may keep it straight and our sisters [Music] there is a dressing of don't try don't try it You know, so the way she's not protecting her womanhood, that what Solomon is saying, womanhood doesn't work like that. And then the third virtue here is sacred motherhood, sacred trust, secret womanhood and sacred motherhood. Listen now I'm talking about n the nature and character of the bride. And brother Brham says when I speak about this woman see the church that's preparing herself and out of her comes a people with a new name. Have you heard me? &gt;&gt; Notice that's committed to her. That's the third virtue. Sacred virtue, sacred womanhood, sacred motherhood, honor her husband, sacred virtue. Amen. Amen. So bad dressing by woman dishonors her body. Amen. This is the quote now. as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood. Now listen here the word church when I say woman as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtue to her husband. The church has a sacred responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has. But we need to train our virtuous areas as born sons that make the bride to be found in prayer to be found in the word and to really have constant fellowship with Christ. Those three things now. So in teaching on adoption in the message here him brother Brham says now here is where I think that Pentecostal church made their mistake when that son was born into the family. He was a son at birth. I want to say all of you are sons and daughters of God. God knows you. You were in the book, but he wants to work on you so that you may be able to bring forth the manifestation of your name. Amen. But his inheritance was not yet determined. It depended &gt;&gt; on his character. The inheritance depended on his character depended on those three things. Sacred trust, secret womanhood, secret you know virtue, which means that we need to marry ourselves to prayer to the word and a constant fellowship with Christ. Therefore, character determines your personal inheritance so that you may stand out like a John the Baptist from all the entire body of Christ and you have found your place, your position, and you say, "I am one. [Applause] I'm not here as an imitation. I am not. You become a character that pulls the body a certain way. You start seeing things in a certain perspective. And when you begin to share what God is showing you because you have come to a particular form of manifestation, it begins to bless the body. And that's how we recognize our gift. And that's now how we can show the manifestation of who we are. You may be poor in the world's goods, &gt;&gt; but you'll be a voice in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A voice &gt;&gt; that's dressed in the word. &gt;&gt; Who am I? Who am I? I'm part of the body, but God, what do you want me to do? What do you want me to be? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; you may never know, but it is hidden in the world. One day at a time, shows you one thing, you do that. Tomorrow, you see another thing. You do that. the other day you you know and you may never know until when trouble come to you and call you mighty man of valor and then will begin to wonder the least of my family what is the list in the tribe how mighty can I be he kept himself in the world doing the little thing in ministry is not doing big things but finding out that God needs me. God can anoint you today when you come down here. You are not competing with anybody doing the will of God. Amen. We need people who will stand because we already on the way out. Amen. So it's now your generation unless you go in this tabernacle might not be complete. We need a somewhere. We need a somewhere that anointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we should learn to wait on our ministry. Paul says all ministry, let us wait on our ministry. Or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exaltth on exaltation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth with diligence, he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness, and the real true Christian, the real believer in God waits upon the Lord for these things. Amen. So wait on your ministry. I feel a call be sure that it is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm doing this because I feel there is a need for people to stand in the gap in certain areas. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; John, who are you? He knew who he was. Straight. I'm a voice of one crying in the but who are you? &gt;&gt; They were not looking for the physical name but the position in the body that God has revealed to you and uses you in that position. Who am I? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; Your position &gt;&gt; knew that beyond being a part of Judah, I must have a personal position. A part of me being a part of the bride and I have sacred trust. I've got sacred womanhood. I've got sacred virtue. I behave like a bride. That is good. But what's my position in the body? The answer is you may never know. But as long as you get married to the word, And every little thing that you see in the world, you perform it. You become a mighty man of valor. God bless you. We give the Lord a hand of praise. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Who am I? We shall continue answering the question from different directions. Who am I the next time I'm here? I'm not I'm going to tell you that you don't craft yourself. I have called by name. So there is a call upon your life. You just need the grace of God to reveal it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let these sisters come over here again. &gt;&gt; Who am I? Brother Joshua, you can come. Who am I? Amen. &gt;&gt; I really like that. So the predestinated of the father is something special. Who am I? &gt;&gt; Who am I? That's a very important thing to know who you are in the body of Christ. The eagles, the young eagles should be quick. Not slow, fast. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Would you want to know your name? &gt;&gt; We shall deal with that. And for a long time, God bless. Bless you. [Applause] if we could. Oh, glor. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can we all stand and just worship him this afternoon? &gt;&gt; My life is no longer mine.

I've been reminded there's a concern from the the deon board. &gt;&gt; A concern And this goes to the mothers. We are kindly requesting the mothers to do their best and ensure that we are not blocking the toilet system with the diapers of the babies. You can just put them right outside &gt;&gt; or we have a a place we burn them right at the pit. &gt;&gt; So it it helps us because when our systems are blocked then we are not able to use them very well and it also lessens on the costs as a church.
