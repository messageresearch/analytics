[34:26] e
[34:56] e e
[35:44] sitation that I suffered
[35:47] from but the Lord is so
[35:50] good that I'm alive up to
[35:56] now and I I was involved in business at
[36:00] that
[36:02] time and I was buying
[36:07] produce and something interesting
[36:13] happened there was a man who came at the
[36:17] shop I had at the
[36:20] center and he says uh I've got a
[36:25] track of uh
[36:28] maze will you buy it I said yeah then he
[36:33] says I've got also
[36:35] [Music]
[36:36] soybeans and it's a
[36:39] track and I've got beans
[36:42] also he says will you buy them I said
[36:47] yeah I
[36:48] will he says you see I'm coming
[36:53] here he said these things are getting
[36:57] here by 7 in the
[37:00] morning L did I know he was trying to Su
[37:06] out of
[37:09] me the knowledge whether I had money in
[37:12] the
[37:20] house did I know the man was a robber
[37:29] so what
[37:30] happened I traveled to
[37:34] Ginger to get money out of the
[37:37] bank and then I traveled back
[37:42] home and they were traing my
[37:46] movement and then later on something
[37:50] pulled me and I came back to Ginger so I
[37:55] did not spend the night at home
[37:59] and that night the robbers
[38:03] came so we were staying together my
[38:07] brother's house as you understand the
[38:11] homee my father's house there and then
[38:15] we're just on those uh uh you know guest
[38:18] Wing at the
[38:22] back so they came with
[38:25] guns and my father had
[38:28] gun my brother had a
[38:31] gun but little did they
[38:33] know they only knew of my
[38:37] father so they stood at the back and the
[38:41] front they begin to
[38:44] shoot come
[38:46] out if you are a man then my brother in
[38:50] his house he
[38:55] escaped and they came direct to my place
[38:59] where I used to
[39:02] stay so I was not
[39:05] there they ask my wife where is he then
[39:10] she says it's not here they looked all
[39:13] over the house and I was not there so
[39:18] they took my wife to my brother's
[39:21] house and say we want you to show us
[39:25] where your uh brother-in-law
[39:29] stay the room
[39:32] direct so she took them when they
[39:35] entered in there they said lot of
[39:38] precious
[39:40] things and as they were trying to grab
[39:44] them my wife
[39:50] escaped and So eventually
[39:53] afterwards they started asking where is
[39:55] she
[39:57] where is she they couldn't see her
[40:00] that's now the
[40:02] time when they were trying to open up
[40:04] the
[40:06] cars to load everything they they had
[40:10] taken and run away with it and back in
[40:14] my
[40:15] place they had roded one of the
[40:18] mattresses and
[40:21] rolled and
[40:22] peace was roded in that mattress
[40:31] and she was just a little
[40:33] kid I think about three four years I
[40:36] mean
[40:39] months and she was rode in
[40:42] there so in the
[40:45] fight my father my brother sent them
[40:48] some
[40:50] fire they also returned then my brother
[40:55] continued and it was was not easy for
[40:58] them to run with end of the
[41:02] C and that way peace
[41:05] survive she couldn't be loaded on
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:11] the you see we need to remember the good
[41:16] things that the Lord does for
[41:21] us you know uh
[41:25] sometimes to get to this level let me
[41:29] tell you another interesting
[41:31] thing my
[41:34] mother-in-law was working as a
[41:39] nurse and she had had a night
[41:45] Duty she had worked in the
[41:47] night and so somebody
[41:51] came C and she was not
[41:55] responding and then a child comes out
[41:58] and said mama is not
[42:02] in okay tell her that her daughter were
[42:07] attacked by robbers last
[42:12] night she jumped out of the
[42:17] house what
[42:18] happened so
[42:21] sometimes we
[42:23] forget certain things that we should
[42:25] give thanks to God for
[42:29] amen and then after a few
[42:34] years we moved and settled in
[42:38] Tor and in
[42:40] t
[42:42] July of
[42:44] 1985 the government of of
[42:52] fell it was a very difficult time
[42:57] they DEC
[43:01] the and now when they declar
[43:06] the you couldn't get out of the house by
[43:11] seven so that same
[43:14] night soldiers came rounded up the
[43:19] house and they got in the house they
[43:22] told me get out I got out they said
[43:26] let's go
[43:27] I said I'm not going
[43:30] anywhere and I remained right there I
[43:33] began calling upon the
[43:35] Lord and I prayed they were inside there
[43:40] collecting everything they could
[43:42] lay and now this man here just wanted to
[43:47] shoot
[43:48] me and I said Lord I give my life to you
[43:53] ruling the Affairs of men
[43:57] here got
[43:59] convicted R back his gun on the
[44:02] shoulder he was commanding that
[44:05] troop he ENT into the house and told
[44:09] them everything you've touched in that
[44:12] house leave it
[44:19] there leave it there so they dropped
[44:23] everything came out they told me go back
[44:26] in
[44:28] and at that time my wife was
[44:33] pregnant expecting
[44:38] patience so the following
[44:42] day I told her not to stay in that
[44:46] place I told her to go back in the
[44:49] village and I stayed alone after one
[44:53] week I wanted to go and check on them
[44:57] I'm giving you the history
[45:00] here so when I went to check on
[45:03] them there is a
[45:08] brother he was just a secondary school
[45:11] student
[45:13] then I left him in charge of the
[45:17] house and so you could go to his
[45:22] father they could get the
[45:25] lunch then comes back to keep the
[45:29] house but before 7 in the
[45:33] evening the rain came so
[45:37] heavily it was too much
[45:40] rain and eventually he failed to
[45:44] come back and that night everything I
[45:49] had in the
[45:50] house was
[45:53] stolen that's
[45:55] how I I decided to come down to
[46:02] Ginger I came when I had
[46:09] nothing and I rented the 10 by 10
[46:14] room and that's
[46:16] where brother you know we started the
[46:20] church
[46:21] from when God is
[46:24] moving and moving you he can allow
[46:29] anything he allowed
[46:31] persecution upon the disciples in
[46:35] Jerusalem and when they were scattered
[46:38] abroad then the gospel began to
[46:42] spread sometimes there is a lot of good
[46:47] light in bad
[46:49] things and sometimes you realize it much
[46:54] later and when I came
[46:57] I had totally
[46:59] nothing but then I had a call upon my
[47:03] heart aing to the
[47:06] dream which brother
[47:11] had that my call is in
[47:14] ginger and when I came I didn't have a
[47:18] job I didn't have
[47:20] anything but I want to give thanks to
[47:22] God for the man called God free m
[47:30] right behind
[47:32] there every week he fed my
[47:37] house for a number of
[47:39] years he could ride a
[47:42] bicycle bring food and I want to say God
[47:47] bless you
[47:50] [Applause]
[47:54] brother God bless you so much
[47:58] amen and you know when we came down
[48:02] here we tried to get out of that 10 by
[48:07] 10 and we were about five
[48:11] people we
[48:12] got
[48:14] school on Grant
[48:17] Road
[48:19] Ro up there and then when we went to
[48:24] that
[48:25] school the only
[48:27] came when they saw we were five
[48:30] people they told us not to come again
[48:33] next
[48:37] week we moved from
[48:43] 1986 to
[48:46] 1992 we moved in six different
[48:53] places we try to stay a little more
[49:00] in school in
[49:04] ganization
[49:06] came and rented the
[49:09] hle and they promised to paint
[49:12] it P the
[49:14] libr and then they
[49:16] demanded they don't want any other group
[49:19] in that
[49:22] school they told us to leave
[49:27] so we went down to the house of
[49:31] brother and then from there we went to W
[49:36] East Primary
[49:38] School school and then we were there for
[49:40] quite some
[49:42] time there is a
[49:45] lady
[49:48] MRSA who is the mother of the Manda boys
[49:53] B and the rest of them
[49:57] the head mistress there she gave us a
[50:01] place and we really were
[50:03] happy but several years I think two or
[50:08] so when she got
[50:11] transferred a Muslim head teacher
[50:15] came and when the school closed for
[50:19] Holiday all the
[50:21] seats and everything were locked out and
[50:27] we were sent
[50:28] out but you see God is
[50:32] good when we were being sent
[50:35] out Brother
[50:37] David had become the deputy head teacher
[50:40] of Main Street primary
[50:45] school stre schol I don't know Brother
[50:49] David is
[50:50] here right there God bless you Brother
[50:53] David also
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:57] and we stayed
[51:00] there up
[51:02] to
[51:05] 1992 and it is 33
[51:08] years since
[51:10] then the gospel has been
[51:14] sweet and very you know been missionary
[51:21] minded and I remember the trip to
[51:27] I don't know brother Nas are you here
[51:31] brother is
[51:32] there and you know going into those
[51:36] areas at the
[51:38] time you had to get
[51:42] worried because you had to go through
[51:44] the
[51:47] game and was
[51:49] there and I always feared the
[51:52] water so I could not go through Lake
[51:58] so I
[51:59] prayed and so we decided to drive and
[52:03] go and we came through the
[52:06] G as we were coming to the
[52:09] end we came to a
[52:12] bridge and you know it was eroded on one
[52:17] side on the other side and there was
[52:20] some kind of a a hill like in the middle
[52:23] of the RO
[52:31] and normally when you are
[52:33] driving you would put one of the
[52:37] tires on that protruded position which
[52:40] had been you know
[52:48] surviv but all of a
[52:51] sudden there were people standing in
[52:53] front of
[52:55] us and talk about the
[52:59] scare we thought we had gone into the
[53:02] ambush of
[53:06] people and while I was looking at
[53:10] them little did I see that
[53:13] spot so my tire was
[53:17] here and here and under there was a
[53:20] raised
[53:23] spot and the car was hit
[53:26] it went up like a
[53:28] plane and came down the dust was too
[53:33] much I don't remember who else was with
[53:36] me on that
[53:40] trip I don't remember do you remember
[53:43] who no but brother was
[53:47] there so we
[53:49] drove for over 100
[53:53] km after that to the place that's where
[53:56] you were going to have
[53:58] meetings so when we go to the place I
[54:02] told
[54:03] Brother take the car to the garage he
[54:07] dro the car and when he got to the gate
[54:10] of the
[54:11] garage he told the man what the problem
[54:14] was and the man came to drive the
[54:17] car when he came the car was not
[54:20] moving and he says how did you drive
[54:23] this car here
[54:26] he says I just drove
[54:28] it but the ti ends which hold the
[54:35] tires it was broken but the car went for
[54:39] over 100
[54:41] km that is
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:48] God praise the
[54:50] Lord you see you know you remember a few
[54:54] things and then you start wondering why
[54:58] did the Lord allow me to live up to this
[55:04] spot I was supposed to go to West
[55:11] again
[55:12] and I want tell you that I prayed the
[55:16] whole
[55:19] night I fear the
[55:22] G because of Co and then I fear the
[55:27] water I could not go on the
[55:30] boat finally I
[55:32] decided let me go by the
[55:37] boat it was I and
[55:41] brother and we drove we went up
[55:45] to to get on the
[55:49] boat we left the car at the police
[55:53] station and you know it was very late
[55:56] when we got the boat to take us across
[55:58] the
[56:02] lake and what
[56:04] happened is that they loaded the
[56:09] boat and the boat was so
[56:12] full so we began to
[56:14] sail and it was getting
[56:19] dark
[56:20] eventually we go to a place and the
[56:24] engine
[56:28] and the storm started coming on the
[56:31] sea the water was coming
[56:34] in it was already getting
[56:38] dark so some the man one of the
[56:41] men stood at the head of the
[56:44] Bo and he was trying to wave a white
[56:49] cloth vure somebody will see
[56:52] us but it was getting dark
[56:57] so we decided to
[56:59] pray the water would fall in into the
[57:03] boat when they tried to SCP it
[57:06] out it was not possible because there
[57:10] were so many feet of the people at the
[57:13] bottom of the of the
[57:17] boat so there was more water coming
[57:21] in what could be scooped
[57:24] out we decided with
[57:27] brothera let us pray when we prayed
[57:31] another boat
[57:33] came and the boat which
[57:36] came it was Fisherman's
[57:40] Boat who had laid their next
[57:43] there and our boat went into that
[57:47] spot and Tangled itself with the boat I
[57:50] mean with the the
[57:53] net and the engine stopped
[57:59] [Music]
[58:03] were very heavy
[58:05] guy and they were saying we are going to
[58:07] drop your Bo in the
[58:12] water we
[58:14] prayed they negotiated for
[58:17] money they gave them the money they put
[58:21] they put a
[58:23] rope and they took us across
[58:27] the
[58:28] gospel
[58:30] sometimes is bleeding with
[58:37] blood
[58:38] [Music]
[58:39] sometimes when people saw successful
[58:46] work they desire to head
[58:51] it but they don't know where you came
[58:54] from with it
[59:01] I remember when I was with my
[59:05] wife and
[59:07] brother were moving
[59:12] from and it was night we from one
[59:16] meeting going to
[59:18] another and there was a man who was
[59:21] carrying heavy
[59:27] and I was sympathetic with him it was as
[59:31] large as an electric Paul would
[59:37] be and when I said let look at this man
[59:40] who is really laboring with this
[59:44] law little did I know he was a
[59:48] robber that l in the
[59:52] RO up to now we cannot tell how how
[59:57] drove over
[1:00:01] it it
[1:00:04] happened God is always
[1:00:07] good and I really thank
[1:00:10] God there are so many things that we
[1:00:14] have come through in the bringing forth
[1:00:17] of this
[1:00:18] message to the people and once in a
[1:00:22] while I'll be sharing some of those
[1:00:25] testimonies
[1:00:27] but God is
[1:00:30] good amen praise the Lord God is
[1:00:35] good so I want us to stand
[1:00:39] up and get into the scripture
[1:00:45] reading Psalms chapter
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:48] 23 and verse
[1:00:54] one it's
[1:00:56] says the
[1:00:58] Lord is my
[1:01:00] shepherd I shall not
[1:01:03] want precious Heavenly
[1:01:06] Father we want to give thanks to you for
[1:01:10] the grace that has gathered us in your
[1:01:13] presence today I trust that you
[1:01:16] present and father that you are going to
[1:01:19] speak to us we dedicate and Commit This
[1:01:22] service into your
[1:01:23] hands in Jesus name
[1:01:26] amen you may be
[1:01:31] seated so
[1:01:33] today I have a
[1:01:36] title the holding
[1:01:40] gift to
[1:01:42] hold and not let
[1:01:44] go the holding
[1:01:47] gift amen but before we get
[1:01:51] there I want to do one
[1:01:54] thing and uh
[1:01:57] pray uh for the
[1:01:59] people that support a
[1:02:04] service I'm talking about the song
[1:02:08] leaders and then the
[1:02:11] interpreters we shall pray for them amen
[1:02:16] now he says here in the message Paradox
[1:02:20] of
[1:02:22] Chicago in 1963
[1:02:26] he says it makes me feel
[1:02:29] good to hear good
[1:02:32] singing and then he says
[1:02:35] and I go in the office down
[1:02:41] there and he constantly got them tapes
[1:02:44] of
[1:02:48] singing going all the
[1:02:51] time and I think his kind of helps him
[1:02:57] amen it's good listening to Christian
[1:03:02] music it has got a
[1:03:05] message it has got some form of
[1:03:09] consolation so he says you know there's
[1:03:12] something about
[1:03:13] s that's got power in
[1:03:16] it we all know we are aware of that just
[1:03:22] look at the
[1:03:24] Amy when they sing the songs and play
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:28] music do you
[1:03:30] know the approach to
[1:03:33] war in the arm of God is first by
[1:03:38] music the singers went before the
[1:03:42] Earth rejoicing and
[1:03:45] singing then come the
[1:03:48] AR the
[1:03:50] battle that's the right
[1:03:54] approach amen
[1:03:56] so he has told us music is a blessing to
[1:03:59] the
[1:04:01] soul because it speaks to your
[1:04:04] soul and he has told us even when the
[1:04:08] arm is going to
[1:04:10] B they
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:17] go yeah theying
[1:04:20] fire and so they
[1:04:23] sing and he says even in the the coming
[1:04:26] in of the
[1:04:28] Ark it was music that brought in the
[1:04:33] ark are you together with me okay then
[1:04:37] he says in another quote in the same
[1:04:41] message and that's the reason we come in
[1:04:43] the service at
[1:04:46] night what do we do sing the HM of the
[1:04:50] Lord and then the
[1:04:52] Y the word we read the word
[1:04:56] and the
[1:04:58] battle amen so the great burners are
[1:05:01] flying
[1:05:06] tonight the name of Jesus
[1:05:09] Christ the Lord God may be exalted the
[1:05:14] enemy to be put to
[1:05:17] flight amen that's why we
[1:05:20] sing praise God Amen you go singing and
[1:05:25] praising
[1:05:27] going into battle and that's exactly
[1:05:30] what
[1:05:31] happen when the Ark of David was coming
[1:05:37] in he prepared the
[1:05:40] singers who went
[1:05:43] before and they s and even David before
[1:05:48] that he also used to
[1:05:50] see and now Saul who was always burdened
[1:05:55] in his
[1:05:56] heart when he walked into that
[1:06:00] singing he was
[1:06:04] released I don't know but let me tell
[1:06:07] you one of the
[1:06:09] reasons why you fail to step into the
[1:06:13] atmosphere of the
[1:06:16] service is simply because you have
[1:06:19] missed the song
[1:06:22] service when you miss the song service
[1:06:26] it becomes very difficult for
[1:06:29] you to get into the
[1:06:33] inspiration to catch and understand what
[1:06:36] the minister is trying to talk
[1:06:39] about you need to come and relieve
[1:06:44] yourself and get into the right
[1:06:47] atmosphere that when you see and you
[1:06:50] hear other
[1:06:52] things when the
[1:06:54] spirits to
[1:06:57] you they are put to
[1:07:01] flight that's why
[1:07:04] musicians must do a good
[1:07:07] job must do a good
[1:07:09] job amen you need to
[1:07:12] pray when you are coming in to do the
[1:07:15] song
[1:07:16] service because you are the one who sets
[1:07:20] the atmosphere
[1:07:22] right amen when you come and you totally
[1:07:27] fail it's a problem you don't just come
[1:07:30] down here to sing whatever comes in your
[1:07:35] mind because we expect you to pray for
[1:07:38] your
[1:07:39] service and as you pray for your
[1:07:42] Serv something happens but the Lord
[1:07:46] himself by Grace puts you into the same
[1:07:50] range of
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:52] Mind amen of the message which is going
[1:07:55] to be
[1:07:56] preached and then you think about the
[1:08:00] songs you write down the songs you
[1:08:03] want you make a
[1:08:06] not amen because it's a
[1:08:09] service and then you from this song I'm
[1:08:13] going to this song this song Here talks
[1:08:16] about Victory we are going to sing
[1:08:19] Victory in
[1:08:21] Jesus talk about men
[1:08:25] in
[1:08:26] battle how they went
[1:08:29] in talk about David when he went
[1:08:33] in
[1:08:36] and what a joy it was praise the Lord
[1:08:41] stand up all of us let us sing Victory
[1:08:44] in Jesus so the song leader is already
[1:08:48] putting you into the
[1:08:51] inspiration into the direction of the
[1:08:53] spirit
[1:08:57] praise the Lord amen you see you don't
[1:09:01] just come to read
[1:09:03] songs let me sing this and then that and
[1:09:07] then
[1:09:07] this you are leading the people into
[1:09:11] worship into recognizing the goodness of
[1:09:15] God in the love of God praise God Amen
[1:09:21] so before I go
[1:09:23] down to pray for all the
[1:09:26] people leaders and
[1:09:29] interpreters we didn't dedicate them
[1:09:32] last
[1:09:33] Sunday but we are going to do it this
[1:09:37] day you see we just want to bring one
[1:09:42] example the example that I want us to go
[1:09:46] into is second chronicles
[1:09:51] 5 the dedication of Solomon's Temple
[1:09:57] amen you see song
[1:10:00] leaders are an integral part of the
[1:10:06] service are you together with me they an
[1:10:09] integral part of the
[1:10:13] service amen they either kill the
[1:10:16] service or they give it
[1:10:22] life
[1:10:24] so you know they need to be
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:29] skilled I've always spoken about
[1:10:32] that the musicians the men who play
[1:10:37] things you know your
[1:10:40] ministry as
[1:10:42] musicians is
[1:10:44] different from the preacher
[1:10:47] Ministry the preacher does it
[1:10:52] alone but the musicians
[1:10:56] you are a
[1:10:58] team if one plays
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:02] being there is a be and another
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] place you confuse the song
[1:11:13] leader and if the song asks
[1:11:18] for and then he begins to sing with
[1:11:21] d he confuses the
[1:11:27] so you are a
[1:11:30] team so you must learn what to do as a
[1:11:35] team you must find time to be here and
[1:11:42] train to put the service
[1:11:46] right amen yes sir so
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:51] listen also the
[1:11:53] Levites which were the
[1:11:56] singers all of them of
[1:11:59] Assa of hon of
[1:12:02] Judi with their sons and
[1:12:06] their beinged in white
[1:12:10] linen having symbols andies and
[1:12:16] hearts stood at the East End of
[1:12:21] the and with them 120 priests around
[1:12:25] sounding with
[1:12:31] trumpets now listen at the turn of
[1:12:36] events and it came even to
[1:12:39] pass as the
[1:12:42] trumpeters and
[1:12:44] singers were as
[1:12:47] one they are not playing out of
[1:12:52] key but the singers
[1:12:56] and the
[1:12:57] trumpeters as
[1:12:59] one to make one sound to be heard in
[1:13:04] praising and thanking the
[1:13:12] lord they when they lifted up their
[1:13:19] voice with the trumpets and symbols and
[1:13:22] instruments of Music uh
[1:13:34] and praise the Lord
[1:13:37] say for his
[1:13:39] good for his must end
[1:13:43] forever the house was filled with a
[1:13:48] cloud even the house of the
[1:13:51] Lord what brought the cloud down
[1:13:55] the Joshua
[1:14:00] Ministry
[1:14:01] Moses mes
[1:14:04] Cal if they are here
[1:14:07] singing and they agree with the
[1:14:12] musicians God dwells in the Praises of
[1:14:15] his
[1:14:17] people the cloud came
[1:14:22] down so they make
[1:14:26] the
[1:14:27] service and the scripture says so that
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:31] priests could not stand to
[1:14:35] minister by reason of the
[1:14:38] cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[1:14:40] filled in the house of
[1:14:43] God praise the Lord the
[1:14:47] ministers they could not stand to
[1:14:50] minister that's the kind of service I
[1:14:54] want that the song service has been so
[1:15:00] anointed and that the presence of the
[1:15:02] Lord has come
[1:15:04] down I do not have
[1:15:08] position to stand at
[1:15:10] theit that the Lord
[1:15:13] himself takes over the ministry of the
[1:15:17] world ministering Bey
[1:15:21] me that's what we are looking for and
[1:15:25] that's what I want to dedicate the song
[1:15:27] leaders
[1:15:30] for and even these men here to come in
[1:15:34] the same spirit that we may always
[1:15:37] praise the
[1:15:38] Lord amen and we have them here and we

[1:16:56] and those who sing Lord give them the
[1:16:59] grace that they may blend
[1:17:04] together pray Lord Jesus that these men
[1:17:09] as they father go ahead of the
[1:17:13] service you may anoint them specifically
[1:17:17] Lord that when they do their
[1:17:20] work The Cloud of
[1:17:22] Glory always come down
[1:17:26] to release the people from Spirits of
[1:17:31] depression and oppression Lord give them
[1:17:35] Grace that they be a blessing to the
[1:17:38] people have committed them dedicated for
[1:17:42] service in Jesus name
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:52] amen praise the Lord
[1:17:55] so here we
[1:17:57] go into the teaching of the
[1:18:00] word the holding
[1:18:03] gift Psalms
[1:18:06] 23 so I take you down here first to the
[1:18:10] Book of
[1:18:12] Amos 3 verse
[1:18:15] 11 I want to have about one hour one and
[1:18:21] half I pray that the Lord May bless
[1:18:26] interpret also in Jesus name amen God
[1:18:32] bless you so Amos
[1:18:35] 3 therefore thus says the Lord
[1:18:40] God anary there shall be even around
[1:18:44] about the
[1:18:47] land shall bring down thy strength from
[1:18:52] thee and thy palaces shall be
[1:18:56] spoiled and thus says the
[1:18:59] Lord as the shepherd taketh out of the
[1:19:02] mouth
[1:19:11] ofie so shall the children of Israel be
[1:19:14] taken out that dwell in
[1:19:21] Samar in the cor of a bed
[1:19:25] and inas in the
[1:19:28] court an
[1:19:30] adversary the Lord says shall be around
[1:19:34] the
[1:19:36] land and it shall bring down thy
[1:19:40] strength amen so I want you
[1:19:44] friends to learn one thing that the
[1:19:47] devil will always be the
[1:19:50] devil he cannot
[1:19:53] retire from what he
[1:19:56] is the scripture here is talking about
[1:20:00] the enemy the
[1:20:02] adversary surrounding
[1:20:05] Israel so that he can weaken the
[1:20:08] nation he can weaken the
[1:20:11] church I don't want you to go
[1:20:14] weak amen try to come up time the enemy
[1:20:19] tries to punch
[1:20:21] you amen try to rise back
[1:20:27] there is a brother in one of the
[1:20:30] churches amen he was son of a
[1:20:33] pastor and then when the father died he
[1:20:37] went to drink
[1:20:40] it but then he spoke about the grace of
[1:20:46] God because each time
[1:20:56] yeah that is in such and such
[1:21:00] a he would walk in to go and bring him
[1:21:06] out he had a good job he had good
[1:21:11] money and then he would hear
[1:21:14] again in that he still go and bring him
[1:21:19] and he would tell him repent and now
[1:21:23] when he told him that
[1:21:25] he says but why because I'll do it
[1:21:29] tomorrow and brother says I will not get
[1:21:34] tired of trying to get you
[1:21:36] back each time you
[1:21:39] st that's the shepher he doesn't give up
[1:21:43] on
[1:21:44] anybody he kept redeeming
[1:21:47] that finally one of the best preachers
[1:21:51] in Church
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:55] praise the Lord that's what God does he
[1:21:59] says that the adversary
[1:22:01] count to surround your house to surround
[1:22:05] you to surround the church but God is
[1:22:11] determined to deliver you from the hold
[1:22:14] of the
[1:22:16] enemy amen so now Psalms 23
[1:22:21] verse1 he says the Lord is my shepher
[1:22:27] shall
[1:22:28] not so David
[1:22:32] compressed all the attributes of God
[1:22:37] together amen so you know he
[1:22:42] says of all those
[1:22:44] attributes he lamped them
[1:22:47] together and called it the
[1:22:51] Lord amen the Lord is referring to
[1:22:56] him by all the
[1:22:59] attributes amen and so he invokes all
[1:23:03] those seven
[1:23:06] attributes he invokes all those seven
[1:23:09] Redemptive
[1:23:12] names and sums them up
[1:23:16] together amen so you know this is very
[1:23:21] interesting because God appear to the
[1:23:26] is in seven different Hard
[1:23:33] Times by a different Redemptive
[1:23:38] name amen he appear to the
[1:23:41] people in seven different
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:45] names in which he hid his
[1:23:49] power to
[1:23:51] redeem amen so his attitude towards the
[1:23:56] people from Eden back
[1:23:59] Eden is wrapped in the seven Redemptive
[1:24:04] names the first one being
[1:24:07] Jehovah which means the Lord will
[1:24:09] provide a
[1:24:13] sacrifice the second one is Jehovah
[1:24:16] Rafa the Lord the Healer
[1:24:30] oure the Lord is
[1:24:32] pres so seven different
[1:24:36] names am when he wants to
[1:24:39] provide he would hide under a certain
[1:24:45] attribute under a different
[1:24:49] title so we serve a God who identif
[1:24:55] himself in many different
[1:24:58] attributes and so taking different
[1:25:03] titles now God is not a theological
[1:25:11] ideology amen is eternal
[1:25:17] reality which unfors
[1:25:20] himself through
[1:25:22] substantiating the word
[1:25:26] amen he's God because he makes his word
[1:25:30] a Living
[1:25:33] Word are you together with me that's
[1:25:36] what makes him
[1:25:38] go yes sir when he says let there be
[1:25:42] light there is light when he says be
[1:25:45] healed in my
[1:25:47] name he'll get healed that's what makes
[1:25:51] him
[1:25:52] God because his word
[1:25:56] life amen he manifest as
[1:26:00] king to the messan
[1:26:03] kingdom where the nation of
[1:26:06] Israel was a mod
[1:26:14] Kingdom
[1:26:17] judge another time as a
[1:26:20] priest and he takes the titles
[1:26:24] to underline the different
[1:26:29] attributes
[1:26:30] amen even when Israel was approaching
[1:26:34] God In
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:36] Worship they knew what title to
[1:26:41] invoke amen praise the Lord they knew
[1:26:45] what
[1:26:47] to we must know what title to
[1:26:52] invoke when we need God
[1:26:56] amen God has a way of
[1:26:59] approach amen you know if you are going
[1:27:02] to visit a
[1:27:04] king there is a way you approach a
[1:27:07] king totally different from a
[1:27:11] Jud amen you are going
[1:27:15] to you don't just go any and you are so
[1:27:19] you know you have to approach him in a
[1:27:21] way
[1:27:24] you don't call him
[1:27:34] William there is a way to
[1:27:37] approach there is a way to
[1:27:40] approach and so we look at it in Matthew
[1:27:44] 9 there came a
[1:27:47] ruler and worshiped
[1:27:52] him saying
[1:27:55] my daughter is even now
[1:28:00] dead but come and let hand upon
[1:28:04] her and she shall
[1:28:07] leave he now headed to
[1:28:11] God and lay hand to raise the sick
[1:28:17] God along the
[1:28:19] way he met a woman with a blood issue
[1:28:26] for 12 years who touched the H of His
[1:28:31] Garment and she was healed
[1:28:35] instantly so he finally go to the
[1:28:37] ruler's
[1:28:39] house where he found the
[1:28:43] dead and took her by the
[1:28:46] hand and the M came back to
[1:28:49] life are you together with me and the
[1:28:52] flame went br
[1:28:55] as he continued on the
[1:28:58] journey then he found two Blind
[1:29:01] Men followed him
[1:29:04] crying and saying th son of
[1:29:08] David have Merc on us th son of David
[1:29:13] have mercy on us he asked them believe
[1:29:17] ye that I am able to do
[1:29:22] this and when he asked they answered in
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:26] affirmative he touched their
[1:29:29] eyes and healed
[1:29:32] them then he continued going
[1:29:35] further in Matthew
[1:29:38] 15 a woman of
[1:29:41] Canan came out of the same
[1:29:44] coast and Cried unto him saying have mer
[1:29:49] on
[1:29:49] me oh th son of David
[1:29:54] my daughter is vexed grievously with the
[1:29:58] devil she is the woman of
[1:30:01] Canan and she's crying the same
[1:30:05] Cry The Blind Men were
[1:30:09] crying son of
[1:30:11] David and healed them amen but now when
[1:30:17] this woman was
[1:30:19] crying he said that to her it's not
[1:30:23] right
[1:30:24] to take children's
[1:30:26] bread C it to
[1:30:28] dog
[1:30:30] why she had the wrong
[1:30:33] approach she was not a Jew she had no
[1:30:38] right to call him son of
[1:30:41] David are you together with me yeah and
[1:30:45] then she said that
[1:30:49] oh even dogs would eat the C
[1:30:55] are you together with me when she came
[1:30:58] into the right
[1:31:02] perspective when she had come out of the
[1:31:07] approach which the Jews would
[1:31:09] do and says I'm not part of
[1:31:13] that but I still need
[1:31:15] Grace then he says I've never seen such
[1:31:18] a faith in
[1:31:21] Israel are you together with me
[1:31:25] God requires the right
[1:31:28] approach and you'll get whatever you
[1:31:31] want amen so we need to learn how to
[1:31:36] approach a redeeming
[1:31:41] shepher amen we want to look at
[1:31:45] God who has the Fallen World before
[1:31:50] him and then what for approach
[1:31:55] we would use to approach
[1:31:58] him amen now I want you to listen to
[1:32:03] this that to redeem the
[1:32:07] elect out of the Fallen
[1:32:10] worldto
[1:32:12] himself he needed to himself into
[1:32:17] Sai a Savi of his own
[1:32:20] creation amen he had to take totally
[1:32:23] different
[1:32:26] from that of
[1:32:29] Creator and from that of a
[1:32:31] judge are you together with me heed
[1:32:36] himself into
[1:32:38] different the attribute of a
[1:32:42] priest amen Redeemer the one who takes
[1:32:46] away the SS of the
[1:32:48] people are you together with me praise
[1:32:52] God listen here what the prophet says he
[1:32:56] says Heavenly Father take us now
[1:32:59] Lord let the great
[1:33:02] shepher the great redeeming
[1:33:06] Shepherd the great Shepherd who left the
[1:33:10] glory knowing that some of the
[1:33:13] attributes was lost on them great vales
[1:33:16] of
[1:33:18] SE where the woles animals would soon
[1:33:22] div the little sheep
[1:33:27] but he left the golden
[1:33:30] Corridor came down into the
[1:33:33] Earth and was made one of
[1:33:36] us he could declare the love of God to
[1:33:43] us I found
[1:33:45] them some of them in
[1:33:49] denominations some of them in the house
[1:33:51] of illame
[1:34:01] some of them on
[1:34:03] streets blind some of them in the hges
[1:34:09] ands but he redeemed
[1:34:12] everyone that the fathered him to
[1:34:18] redeem he redeemed
[1:34:20] everyone so he took the attribute
[1:34:24] this time not the attribute of a
[1:34:28] judge sir but the attribute of a
[1:34:33] redeemer he created
[1:34:35] himself a body of
[1:34:38] sacrifice amen so he had made himself of
[1:34:42] no
[1:34:46] reputation he taken upon him the form of
[1:34:49] a
[1:34:50] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:34:53] men
[1:34:57] amen are you together with me he was now
[1:35:02] a and therefore the approach had
[1:35:09] changed is the approach of have upon me
[1:35:16] Lord are you together with me that's the
[1:35:20] approach now he came with
[1:35:23] did not come as the great consuming
[1:35:28] fire amen he did not come as a great
[1:35:33] judge he came as God the
[1:35:38] servant to serve
[1:35:41] humanity and redeem
[1:35:43] Humanity so the approach had
[1:35:46] Chang in the book of
[1:35:49] Hebrews 2
[1:35:52] verse4 he says for as much then as the
[1:35:55] children partakers of Flesh and
[1:36:00] Blood also likewise took part of the
[1:36:08] same that through
[1:36:10] death he might destroy
[1:36:13] him the power of
[1:36:16] death that's the
[1:36:18] devil are you together with me yes sir
[1:36:22] because the devil
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:28] amen the nature of
[1:36:31] sin into
[1:36:36] humanity and so he says I'm going to
[1:36:40] go in the same
[1:36:43] body flesh and
[1:36:45] blood in the same
[1:36:48] nature in which the devil tments people
[1:36:53] came under the
[1:37:01] same so that the devil could not see
[1:37:06] God see a
[1:37:10] man because he was a
[1:37:12] man who had come to come through the
[1:37:16] same situation of suffering and pain
[1:37:23] so that he can redeem
[1:37:25] those that were under that form of
[1:37:30] captivity so he came under another title
[1:37:36] complet so to become a redeeming
[1:37:39] shepher he needed to become a
[1:37:43] kman and in this light we need to take a
[1:37:49] look into the sheph anointing a little
[1:37:52] bit
[1:37:55] because in there there is a great
[1:37:58] miracle that I want you to
[1:38:01] see
[1:38:03] amen he had to come Among Us he had to
[1:38:07] leave the corridors of
[1:38:09] Glory he are to be born of a
[1:38:12] woman amen come through all the
[1:38:16] pained of the
[1:38:18] devil but then he never
[1:38:24] because God was buil under that
[1:38:29] body so he comes
[1:38:32] to so that he can bring
[1:38:34] us in the
[1:38:36] same
[1:38:38] form that we also can be redeemed and
[1:38:43] overcome the nature of
[1:38:46] sin that's my
[1:38:48] prayer amen so we know
[1:38:55] that all of
[1:38:58] us there is a part of God in
[1:39:03] you a SE on the side of
[1:39:07] you and that's what God was looking
[1:39:10] for when he came down here on
[1:39:13] Earth when he says God so loved the
[1:39:17] world he's not talking about the cosmos
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:25] is talking about
[1:39:27] you that had the nature of God in
[1:39:32] you that's what God was looking
[1:39:35] for amen so we know that we are fitted
[1:39:40] with the part of
[1:39:43] God which is a seed Gene of
[1:39:46] life and these seed
[1:39:49] jeans have in them the power of
[1:39:51] transformation
[1:39:54] that will
[1:39:55] finally Express the person of God that
[1:39:59] you
[1:40:01] are amen yeah because when the Holy
[1:40:05] Spirit comes and touches that
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] c and gives it the revelation of the new
[1:40:15] birth in that seed they power of
[1:40:21] transformation which helps that
[1:40:24] seed to
[1:40:26] grow into the
[1:40:28] image of what God wanted that
[1:40:33] se amen so and then the nature in that
[1:40:38] seed which is
[1:40:41] similar to a particular character of
[1:40:45] God that's what your inheritance is
[1:40:54] because you have got
[1:40:56] a god is so many
[1:40:59] attributes I will give you the
[1:41:02] easy God is a pastor God is an
[1:41:06] evangelist God is
[1:41:08] anost he gets a little bit of
[1:41:11] that and drops it in you and then you
[1:41:15] are not aware you are just as seen as
[1:41:18] anybody
[1:41:19] else but the Holy Ghost comes
[1:41:24] and I mean brings the light toward
[1:41:28] this and the Darkness
[1:41:31] clears and the Holy Ghost Waters that
[1:41:35] seed and when that seed begins to
[1:41:38] grow it grows towards the nature that
[1:41:42] God put on the side
[1:41:45] of if God wanted the
[1:41:49] prayer that se does not grow towards
[1:41:52] prophet
[1:41:54] it grows into what God wants you to
[1:41:58] be amen so God Waters the
[1:42:03] seed that's the seed that he comes
[1:42:07] to and that's the seed comes to
[1:42:12] P are you together with me so a
[1:42:16] pastor is given seed
[1:42:21] je to p
[1:42:24] and the food
[1:42:30] given for those
[1:42:33] je it's only the je that will be able to
[1:42:39] understand what God wants them to
[1:42:43] be amen so that nature
[1:42:48] that is similar to a particular
[1:42:51] character of God
[1:42:53] and I want to say that that
[1:42:57] character is your
[1:43:02] inheritance you inherit on what God
[1:43:06] is praise the lord we cannot be the
[1:43:10] same but whatever you are is a part of
[1:43:15] God that is your
[1:43:17] [Applause]
[1:43:18] inheritance
[1:43:20] amen praise the Lord so this
[1:43:24] process happened in the life of
[1:43:27] David has happen in every
[1:43:30] born amen let me tell you I preached
[1:43:35] here and I told you we are born
[1:43:40] predestinated to the adoption of
[1:43:42] son I told you that I as a
[1:43:46] human when I receive a child I plan his
[1:43:51] inheritance but God is not like me when
[1:43:56] I was born in the kingdom of God I was
[1:44:00] born to
[1:44:01] inherit my inheritance was
[1:44:04] there it was waiting for that's the same
[1:44:08] with you you inheritance in the
[1:44:12] Kingdom amen so we are all different in
[1:44:15] our areas of
[1:44:18] inheritance much as we could
[1:44:20] be in the same calling
[1:44:24] we
[1:44:25] are you know I want say we are
[1:44:29] different and you are the only
[1:44:34] you
[1:44:36] amen there could be so many
[1:44:39] apostles in the history of the
[1:44:42] church and you also could be an
[1:44:45] apost but then you are the only
[1:44:50] kind of
[1:44:55] CH praise God you could be a
[1:45:00] business are the only type of
[1:45:04] business there has never been one like
[1:45:07] you they will never be one
[1:45:11] like when God chooses a pastor like we
[1:45:15] have brother James
[1:45:16] here he's the only who he
[1:45:20] is hallelujah hallelujah not be judged
[1:45:24] by
[1:45:28] me amen he a p God has called and when
[1:45:34] the changing needs of the church
[1:45:38] change amen God needs a man to F the
[1:45:44] needs of that
[1:45:48] time praise the Lord amen
[1:45:53] when he takes you a lot
[1:45:56] deeper that's what we
[1:45:58] needed amen when he comes with a ping
[1:46:04] FL Amen to clean the
[1:46:07] Flor amen that's what we
[1:46:10] need amen because every
[1:46:15] G is a part of
[1:46:18] God that it is so
[1:46:21] original canot be any other
[1:46:25] like so you only
[1:46:28] you from the foundation of
[1:46:32] the Amen in Ephesians
[1:46:36] 1:4
[1:46:38] according as he has chosen Us in
[1:46:41] him before the foundation of the
[1:46:44] world that we should be
[1:46:47] holy and Without Blame before in
[1:46:51] love so he chose

[1:53:30] body the leg had to be where it

[1:53:49] tells you to

[1:54:00] mind which is the mind of
[1:54:03] Christ that's what brings us
[1:54:06] together and then every joint begins to
[1:54:12] supply amen for as we have many members
[1:54:15] in one
[1:54:17] body and all members have not the same

[1:55:02] person he goes and puts all the
[1:55:07] potential Amen in that
[1:55:11] se so that the

[1:56:25] voice hallelujah hallelujah and when he
[1:56:29] would pass
[1:56:37] around they feel the saint of the

[1:57:47] sheep against G in confidence
[1:57:52] hallelujah what did he go out there for
[1:57:56] in the
[1:57:57] battle he had
[1:57:59] gone to tell the nation of
[1:58:03] Israel that I have

[1:58:47] it as he was the elder brother
[1:58:51] of hallelujah hallelujah but the Gen
[1:58:55] inav

[1:59:16] flock and all his
[1:59:19] meditation is about the welfare of the
[1:59:24] hallelujah hallelujah the shepher he
[1:59:27] looks into the FL and is to tell which
[1:59:32] one is sick which one is
[1:59:35] hungry which one is
[1:59:39] hry amen there's no way God would
[1:59:42] address the need of the
[1:59:45] flock amen from another
[1:59:49] ship no he has a shepher
[1:59:54] and we thank God that we've got a
[1:59:58] shepher Among
[2:00:03] Us so in emter
[2:00:07] one and verse one there is a
[2:00:12] secret he says in verse
[2:00:14] one the words of
[2:00:19] Amos who was among the hearts
[2:00:27] of which he saw concerning isra in the
[2:00:30] days of
[2:00:35] King in the days of job the son of Jo
[2:00:38] king of
[2:00:42] Israel two years before the earthquake
[2:00:52] about the general welfare of the
[2:00:56] ship he talks to
[2:01:01] the are you together with me now
[2:01:06] Amos was a
[2:01:08] prophet but
[2:01:10] he was also a
[2:01:14] shepher and when God begins to talk to
[2:01:18] Amos he talks to him in the language of
[2:01:22] a
[2:01:26] shepher are you together with
[2:01:29] me so about the welfare of a
[2:01:38] congregation he talks to
[2:01:42] a
[2:01:44] amen the Evangel
[2:01:52] you just cry every day that's the
[2:01:55] Evangelist he talk about everything
[2:01:59] new a teacher could be letter without
[2:02:15] compassion could be straight
[2:02:19] jacketing is concerned with more Church
[2:02:26] order straight
[2:02:28] jacketing you didn't stand right you
[2:02:31] didn't sit right you
[2:02:32] didn't you didn't dress
[2:02:35] right but the pastor he knows how to
[2:02:39] handle all those
[2:02:44] concerns you see many
[2:02:46] times we try to take over the
[2:02:50] roles of a shepher
[2:02:54] this one is criticizing this one's child
[2:02:56] and that one criticizes the other one's
[2:02:58] child and
[2:03:03] then but the way you're doing it is not
[2:03:07] the
[2:03:11] way I know you've got
[2:03:14] aert but go on your
[2:03:18] knees
[2:03:19] sometimes our children are so young
[2:03:23] that we don't see any
[2:03:26] problem but when they grow you learn to
[2:03:30] say God forgive
[2:03:32] me I didn't
[2:03:36] know raising up those big
[2:03:40] women it has been the grace of
[2:03:45] God pastor's
[2:03:49] children and people were doing all kinds
[2:03:51] saying all kinds of
[2:03:55] things he's always the pastor's
[2:03:58] child who not dressing
[2:04:01] right who's not having a long dress
[2:04:04] enough who's not having good dress
[2:04:08] this but we thank God we made
[2:04:13] it praise the Lord amen so you know God
[2:04:22] spoke to the
[2:04:25] shepherd a prophet Amos he wasman
[2:04:33] of and God when he was speaking to him
[2:04:37] about
[2:04:39] Israel he spoke to him in the ship
[2:04:43] language are you together with me yeah
[2:04:47] the same
[2:04:48] way the king when is speaking to
[2:04:53] him speaking to God he uses the Sheep
[2:05:00] language are you together with me you
[2:05:03] get a
[2:05:04] Deon amen and
[2:05:08] his may be was toon the
[2:05:13] church and he be always
[2:05:17] T he always want you to be in life
[2:05:24] brother
[2:05:25] William are you together with
[2:05:28] me but
[2:05:30] then when God calls a
[2:05:33] man like that and puts him in the pet to
[2:05:38] P the
[2:05:39] people
[2:05:42] changes he's a holding
[2:05:48] gift and so when God was a man like
[2:05:54] David he was a shepher he's always
[2:05:57] talking about the Lord is my
[2:06:00] sheer hallelujah hallelujah because he's
[2:06:03] looking at
[2:06:05] his over which he was a
[2:06:08] shepher as
[2:06:10] she and he looks at them and he has
[2:06:14] sympathy and compassion over
[2:06:17] them because himself also has been sheep
[2:06:21] before
[2:06:25] he understands the problem of
[2:06:28] she he understands that the ship can
[2:06:33] stay but the anointing upon the
[2:06:37] SE is not let that seed go
[2:06:43] forever amen praise the Lord so he spoke
[2:06:47] to
[2:06:48] Amos a shephered prophet of t
[2:06:54] using the shepher
[2:06:56] language to speak to
[2:06:59] Israel Amos 3:
[2:07:03] 11 amen he says therefore th says the
[2:07:06] Lord
[2:07:08] God anary there shall
[2:07:11] be even the
[2:07:14] land and it shall bring down thy
[2:07:19] strength the and thy
[2:07:22] palaces shall be
[2:07:25] sped and th says the Lord hallelujah
[2:07:29] hallelujah he talking to him as a
[2:07:34] shepher he talks to him in sheep
[2:07:39] language and he says that the shepher
[2:07:41] taketh of the mouth out of the mouth of
[2:07:45] the lion two legs
[2:07:53] a p
[2:07:56] of so shall the children of
[2:07:59] Israel taken out that dwell in
[2:08:04] Samaria in the cor of the
[2:08:07] bed and in Damascus in the
[2:08:10] cour hallelujah hallelujah so God
[2:08:15] anoints
[2:08:16] shepher SE a for the Sheep
[2:08:22] hallelujah hallelujah David went and
[2:08:25] killed a
[2:08:26] liar because it was tampering with the
[2:08:30] Sheep are you together with me sometimes
[2:08:34] you have to
[2:08:36] forgive James whens like a defending
[2:08:47] shepher are you together with me he will
[2:08:50] not sit and
[2:08:52] watch the f
[2:08:55] e the understanding of
[2:08:58] Aer is that if I redeem the
[2:09:02] ear maybe the Sheep will grow back from
[2:09:06] that piece
[2:09:09] of Hallelujah Hallelujah if it's a piece
[2:09:12] of
[2:09:14] leg maybe it will grow back from that
[2:09:18] piece of the leg that's the
[2:09:20] understanding of a sh
[2:09:23] hallelujah hallelujah you always need to
[2:09:25] understand when he goes back and brings
[2:09:29] another
[2:09:30] brother you people wouldn't want to be
[2:09:33] in your
[2:09:38] mid that
[2:09:41] one understand the
[2:09:43] shepherd He will go for him and bring
[2:09:47] him down even if the only sance of a
[2:09:50] sheep the piece of
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:55] an amen he bring him bring him
[2:10:00] back amen yes sir that's the
[2:10:05] compassion amen and attachment of
[2:10:10] value that the shepher has to the
[2:10:14] Sheep amen he values the
[2:10:18] sh and as a man
[2:10:21] doing what is Anointed to
[2:10:24] do sometimes it may look so
[2:10:33] easy because the man ISO
[2:10:38] for David was anointed for the
[2:10:41] job that's why he walked out against
[2:10:47] gbody else can do it
[2:10:51] if God has to talk about the
[2:10:55] church he's going to use our
[2:10:59] [Applause]
[2:11:00] sheer don't you think that you also can
[2:11:04] be a
[2:11:06] voice it's not that
[2:11:10] easy David make the work Look So
[2:11:15] Easy his
[2:11:16] [Music]
[2:11:18] son thought he could do it better than
[2:11:20] him
[2:11:24] when you find an anointed
[2:11:26] Pastor stay under that
[2:11:30] anointing the shepher is a
[2:11:34] gift driven by
[2:11:36] compassion toward the general Ware of
[2:11:39] the
[2:11:43] Sheep amen okay let's go to John
[2:11:49] 172 amen
[2:11:52] do you love
[2:11:53] him yes
[2:11:56] sir he says while I was with them in the
[2:12:01] world now this is the chief
[2:12:05] shepher he says while I was them in the
[2:12:11] world I kept them in thy
[2:12:16] name I kept them under your character
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:23] those that thou Gest
[2:12:26] me I have
[2:12:28] kept and none of them is
[2:12:31] lost but the son
[2:12:34] oftion that the scripture might be
[2:12:38] fulfilled those who you gave
[2:12:41] me I've
[2:12:44] L is a holding gift
[2:12:52] Amen to keep you in
[2:12:57] the amen he knows you are
[2:13:01] dirty but he'll keeping you but within
[2:13:05] the
[2:13:09] F amen the
[2:13:12] shepher uses his
[2:13:14] name which means the name of the
[2:13:17] Lord meaning the character of the word
[2:13:22] to keep the ship
[2:13:23] clean to keep the ship
[2:13:26] together he understand the
[2:13:29] strength and the weakness of the
[2:13:32] ship and I want you to know that you are
[2:13:35] a ship with a tender nature and always
[2:13:40] prone to getting
[2:13:43] lost that's the
[2:13:46] shepherd easy to get
[2:13:49] lost you don't know how God deals with
[2:13:52] the local
[2:13:55] church every local church God has given
[2:13:59] a for
[2:14:03] them but then you want to go to another
[2:14:06] church which has got
[2:14:09] another and bring it here that's not the
[2:14:13] way God
[2:14:14] works look at the seven
[2:14:17] churches
[2:14:19] that and was the chief Shepherd among
[2:14:23] them but all of them were different from
[2:14:27] one
[2:14:28] another
[2:14:32] works we don't put a weight on a
[2:14:38] pastor God speaks to him about the local
[2:14:43] church because your sheep your nature is
[2:14:47] easily exploited by the Gods
[2:14:52] which Moses called the mixed
[2:14:57] crowd come in here and they can easily
[2:15:01] confuse that's the problem of
[2:15:08] sh that man is lying to
[2:15:15] you that is
[2:15:18] ship Isaiah 53:6
[2:15:24] all
[2:15:25] we like
[2:15:27] sheep
[2:15:29] have we have turned everyone to his own
[2:15:34] way and the lord has laid on him theity
[2:15:41] of now this is the chief
[2:15:46] shepher he is saying he's looking at
[2:15:50] sheep
[2:15:52] and he says they've gone
[2:15:54] astray everyone has turned to his own
[2:15:59] way amen that's
[2:16:02] sh and he says the
[2:16:05] burden has been put upon the
[2:16:09] sheer to go and look for
[2:16:14] them sheep has a tend to
[2:16:19] scatter if she doesn't keep the eye on
[2:16:22] the
[2:16:24] shepherd because the nature and
[2:16:27] character of sheep is to
[2:16:31] follow my sheep hear my
[2:16:34] voice and a stranger will they not
[2:16:39] follow so that's the attribute of
[2:16:43] Christ to the entire church
[2:16:46] body but then that
[2:16:49] attribute has been
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:52] distributed to the different people that
[2:16:56] are being anointed to be
[2:16:59] pastors they walk ahead of
[2:17:02] the God help me to
[2:17:05] be and keep my eye on the ministry of
[2:17:09] the
[2:17:10] shepherd God has given a local
[2:17:13] church I want to be like
[2:17:16] elishah he did not take his eye away
[2:17:18] from the she
[2:17:21] he kept watching
[2:17:23] theer amen when he needed a gift to be
[2:17:28] like elij El told him keep your eye on
[2:17:33] me
[2:17:36] years he had the eye on the
[2:17:39] sheer
[2:17:40] amen hallelujah hallelujah never
[2:17:44] listen to
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:47] criticize
[2:17:49] listen to Fe
[2:17:53] amen listen to
[2:17:56] Fe not to
[2:17:59] criticize for8
[2:18:02] years Elisha had
[2:18:05] ideas but whenever brought an
[2:18:08] idea
[2:18:10] elah was not B
[2:18:14] him he was telling him go
[2:18:17] away what have I done after
[2:18:21] God is not giving us a bing
[2:18:27] Pastor God is giving us a pastor to feed
[2:18:32] us with the
[2:18:33] word Hold Us Together by the
[2:18:37] word that's what God is
[2:18:41] doing
[2:18:43] sheep need to
[2:18:46] realize that without a
[2:18:49] shepher they are
[2:18:51] God now the people but the Lord is my
[2:18:56] shepher yes but he has
[2:18:59] anointed thater
[2:19:03] anointing
[2:19:05] upon hold the people
[2:19:08] together in the
[2:19:10] word
[2:19:12] amen yes sir so there's you know the
[2:19:17] moment you allow your
[2:19:19] FL let me put it this
[2:19:23] way
[2:19:25] that
[2:19:27] God loves us to remain babies in
[2:19:35] Christ to remain
[2:19:41] LS
[2:19:43] because even in all the religious
[2:19:49] sacrifices it was lamps that were
[2:19:55] used we need to keep
[2:20:00] ourselves as
[2:20:02] humble
[2:20:04] as that way we shall not turn to our own
[2:20:09] ways we shall always be in line with the
[2:20:14] word and the anointing that the Lord has
[2:20:18] given the local church
[2:20:21] are you together with me so the moment
[2:20:24] you allow your
[2:20:26] FL to graduate to
[2:20:30] sh then you'll be in
[2:20:33] trouble I prefer to remain
[2:20:37] L you know sheep a
[2:20:44] sence and now brother
[2:20:46] James you got a
[2:20:49] responsibility to
[2:20:51] teach these people in such a way that
[2:20:56] they always maintain the lamp
[2:21:01] attitude
[2:21:03] amen you know just remind
[2:21:06] them when the Lambs lose their supposed
[2:21:11] innocence and tend to live like
[2:21:15] sheep they certainly begin to
[2:21:19] Str they stray into self-imposed
[2:21:24] postures into self-imposed
[2:21:30] postures they go their own
[2:21:36] pastures I don't want that one I want
[2:21:39] this one that's not
[2:21:42] she are you happy that
[2:21:46] you amen they begin to feed on her grass
[2:21:53] amen which has no
[2:21:56] moisture and they develop spiritual
[2:22:02] constipation
[2:22:04] amen becomes a
[2:22:06] problem hallelujah hallelujah but the
[2:22:09] shepher knows where to lead the
[2:22:12] ship amen but then when they tend to
[2:22:18] develop you know their own mind
[2:22:23] they develop this
[2:22:26] Doctrine thinking that
[2:22:30] complicating amen the simplest of this
[2:22:34] message they think that's the
[2:22:40] depth in the word is to catch that
[2:22:46] [Music]
[2:22:47] door with Christ
[2:22:51] because to know him is life
[2:22:53] eternal amen so God has instructed the
[2:22:59] holding
[2:23:01] gift to hold the
[2:23:04] ship together and also feed them feed my
[2:23:10] LS maintain the status of
[2:23:15] Ls feed my
[2:23:17] sheep by reminding them
[2:23:21] of the simple
[2:23:24] understanding of
[2:23:26] Christ and once they come back to where
[2:23:30] they fell from you reced
[2:23:36] L praise the Lord
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:40] amen he paid the Deb of sin at
[2:23:46] Cal and
[2:23:49] that was all that you needed to be
[2:23:53] free free from
[2:23:55] anything that will inflate
[2:23:58] you from the simplest of
[2:24:01] Christ Redemption was paid
[2:24:05] for but between Calvary and
[2:24:08] now doing the
[2:24:11] work of
[2:24:13] intercession a work to get the
[2:24:17] character to match
[2:24:20] with our
[2:24:23] person
[2:24:25] the amen that it
[2:24:30] produces the nature of Christ and help
[2:24:34] us to live that
[2:24:37] nature so before I
[2:24:40] finish I want us to drop down into
[2:24:44] Psalms
[2:24:47] 23 you know he spread himself out in the
[2:24:53] church that's now the
[2:24:56] shepher by A fivefold
[2:24:59] Min first the
[2:25:02] apostles second the prophets
[2:25:05] evangelist pastors and teachers but all
[2:25:10] those
[2:25:10] gifts there is only one holding
[2:25:16] gift the pastor who feeds the Sheep
[2:25:21] by teaching them so he must be a
[2:25:25] teaching
[2:25:27] Pastor amen when they get the people
[2:25:30] from the
[2:25:33] field they pour them for the
[2:25:36] past the P gets Apostles out of
[2:25:45] them he
[2:25:48] gets he gets
[2:25:50] pastors out of them he teachers out of
[2:25:54] them that's now the
[2:25:57] shepher Psalms
[2:26:00] 23 listen very well David is not
[2:26:04] depending on
[2:26:10] Jus but depending on he that described
[2:26:17] himself as the good shepher
[2:26:21] hallelujah hallelujah who receives the
[2:26:24] ship and washes the
[2:26:27] ship and out of
[2:26:29] them makes them different
[2:26:33] gifts so Psalms
[2:26:36] 23 defs the submission of the
[2:26:41] Lamb that trust the eternal
[2:26:45] [Applause]
[2:26:46] security in the chief shepher
[2:26:51] they are walk behind the chief
[2:26:56] shepher the one who knows where the
[2:26:58] security
[2:27:00] is he knows where the Still Waters are
[2:27:04] he knows where the Green Pastures
[2:27:07] are and he was speaking about
[2:27:10] himself in
[2:27:13] John and verse one he says very
[2:27:18] verily I say unto you
[2:27:20] he that ENT not by the
[2:27:24] door into the ship
[2:27:27] fold but clim up some other
[2:27:32] way the same is the thief and
[2:27:36] Robber now here he's not talking about
[2:27:40] you entering into
[2:27:43] Christ no he talking about a
[2:27:47] man who would want something to do with
[2:27:52] so now here we are now talking about a
[2:27:56] sheer a sheer first by
[2:28:00] himself must have entered by the
[2:28:05] door ship fell to reach the ship he must
[2:28:10] be born
[2:28:11] again he must be in
[2:28:14] Christ in order to be
[2:28:17] able the
[2:28:20] amen he says but he that
[2:28:24] enter by the
[2:28:26] door is the shepher of the
[2:28:29] ship so it's not talking about the New
[2:28:33] Birth he's talking about a
[2:28:36] man who is
[2:28:38] Anointed to be a
[2:28:40] shepher he passes through the
[2:28:46] door and it's the same thing with you
[2:28:50] remember he says behold I stand at the
[2:28:53] door
[2:28:55] and to light the
[2:28:59] sheer are you together with me so when
[2:29:02] God gives us a
[2:29:04] shepher we must not keep our doors
[2:29:08] closed we must open those
[2:29:12] doors because he has already come
[2:29:14] through
[2:29:16] Christ he has been
[2:29:18] anointed he has been given a gift and
[2:29:22] that gift is to deal with you to help
[2:29:26] you to keep you in the
[2:29:30] ship are holding
[2:29:33] gift he says to him the port
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:44] open and the ship hear his
[2:29:47] voice and he call his own ship by
[2:29:52] name them
[2:29:55] out you see the
[2:29:58] ministry of a
[2:30:00] shepher is not
[2:30:11] mechanical it's not much
[2:30:14] read much as
[2:30:16] [Music]
[2:30:17] necessary it's not being so much
[2:30:21] prayerful but yet is
[2:30:23] [Music]
[2:30:25] necessary but it is presenting
[2:30:30] your the
[2:30:35] Lord as a
[2:30:37] shepherd and after You' presented your
[2:30:41] soul you have gone through the
[2:30:44] door then the shepher
[2:30:46] himself begins to trade you
[2:30:50] on how to deal with this
[2:30:56] ship
[2:30:58] ship is a very complicated
[2:31:02] animal you remember when I to on ship
[2:31:06] here one
[2:31:08] time and I showed you how ship when it
[2:31:11] goes mad it's
[2:31:16] mad when they fight they really fight
[2:31:22] and only the
[2:31:23] shepher that will be able to
[2:31:26] understand that
[2:31:28] true these are sheep but they are
[2:31:31] crossing a certain
[2:31:34] line is the burden
[2:31:38] bear is the one who standing when the
[2:31:40] ship begin to
[2:31:43] fight that's the
[2:31:47] shepher so in Ephesians 4:7
[2:31:51] and every one of us is given
[2:31:54] Grace according to the measure of the
[2:31:57] gift of
[2:31:59] Christ hallelujah hallelujah you are
[2:32:02] given a certain measure of
[2:32:06] Grace according to the gift of
[2:32:10] Christ so the ministry of this
[2:32:14] pastor operates certain
[2:32:18] meure Hallelujah Hallelujah you cannot
[2:32:21] compare this
[2:32:23] [Applause]
[2:32:25] one are different
[2:32:27] measures and the need of that local
[2:32:31] church is different from the need of
[2:32:33] this
[2:32:35] church so we cannot put them in the same
[2:32:39] basket and begin to judge
[2:32:42] them amen that's why on the day of
[2:32:47] reconing amen what is going to happen is
[2:32:52] that God is only going to reward the
[2:32:55] faithfulness of the
[2:33:00] minister not how many
[2:33:06] people no but how
[2:33:10] faithful to the five that God had
[2:33:16] given is not going to compare him to
[2:33:20] another brother who has
[2:33:22] 1000 God doesn't work like that he gives
[2:33:27] gifts according to the measure of
[2:33:32] Grace Amen in Matthew
[2:33:38] 253 amen now this is
[2:33:43] the the one who was given
[2:33:45] five and the one who was given two the
[2:33:49] reward was the
[2:33:51] [Music]
[2:33:53] same the reward is
[2:33:57] faithfulness he says well
[2:33:59] done good and faithful
[2:34:02] servant has been Faithful over a few
[2:34:05] things the one who was
[2:34:08] five he was faithful
[2:34:11] in and one had two he was also faithful
[2:34:15] in the
[2:34:16] few so whatever me we have been as
[2:34:20] blessed
[2:34:21] with is just a few
[2:34:25] things but what stands
[2:34:27] [Applause]
[2:34:28] out is character and
[2:34:33] service good and
[2:34:36] faithful even to the one of
[2:34:39] two good and
[2:34:41] Faith the character of the seed
[2:34:48] G amen am praise the Lord so a
[2:34:53] shepher operates with a greater measure
[2:34:56] of
[2:35:00] Grace
[2:35:02] people these other
[2:35:04] gifts he not simply teach of
[2:35:08] doctr he not just a head of
[2:35:12] people the ministry of the
[2:35:15] sheer is Christ building character
[2:35:19] his
[2:35:21] children amen so therefore Psalms
[2:35:26] 23 reveals how God can safely manage the
[2:35:33] Sheep navigating them through the valley
[2:35:36] of the Shadows of
[2:35:39] death and bringing them over into
[2:35:44] safety so Psalms
[2:35:46] 23 reveals the nature of sheep
[2:35:51] sometimes which
[2:35:52] stay and the Sheep
[2:35:55] nature as well as it you know has a way
[2:36:00] to go
[2:36:02] astray there is still a nature in
[2:36:05] it that still complies with the voice of
[2:36:11] God are you together with yeah he may
[2:36:16] stay but then still he has God the
[2:36:21] ability to listen to hear the voice of
[2:36:26] God
[2:36:27] she hear my
[2:36:29] [Music]
[2:36:31] voice and when they hear the
[2:36:35] voice he has the
[2:36:37] ability to rest
[2:36:40] them some people would say let that R
[2:36:45] go but God doesn't do that he knows my
[2:36:49] sheep here
[2:36:52] will come he keeps
[2:36:59] calling and then he sometimes get faint
[2:37:03] he has
[2:37:07] faint and the voice grows
[2:37:10] bigger and grows bigger and he says Ah
[2:37:15] that's the voice of the
[2:37:18] master are you together with me that's
[2:37:21] the voice of the
[2:37:23] master that can be
[2:37:26] restored amen look at God dealing with
[2:37:29] the
[2:37:30] Sheep
[2:37:32] 232 he makes me to lie down in green
[2:37:36] pasture it does the ship doesn't
[2:37:39] say I lie in the green
[2:37:43] pasture but he makes me to
[2:37:47] laugh deci that
[2:37:53] a much as it
[2:37:56] canay it can he The Voice come backto
[2:38:02] me amen praise the
[2:38:05] Lord that can
[2:38:08] be in verse three he Resto my
[2:38:13] soul he Le me in the path of
[2:38:16] righteousness for his name's sake
[2:38:21] that can be
[2:38:22] restored people under this holding
[2:38:27] Ministry understand the nature of
[2:38:31] Sheep amen and we operate with the
[2:38:36] sheep on a level of
[2:38:41] Grace that's how
[2:38:43] difficult a shepher Ministry
[2:38:47] is when he comes to you
[2:38:57] bu a shepher always comes by Grace he
[2:39:02] comes because he
[2:39:04] loves amen let's take this Old Testament
[2:39:10] analogy in Hebrews chter
[2:39:13] 5 verse
[2:39:15] one so that we can be able to relate
[2:39:19] the
[2:39:21] priesthood amen and the ministry of the
[2:39:25] shepherd Forever high
[2:39:28] priest taken from among
[2:39:31] men is
[2:39:33] ordained for many things pering to
[2:39:38] God that may offer both
[2:39:42] gifts and sacrifices for
[2:39:46] sin so he understands
[2:39:50] the nature of
[2:39:53] men he understands the internal fights
[2:39:57] that they
[2:39:59] have a man is called from a
[2:40:06] man that's a shepher that's a priest he
[2:40:11] has been called a man from
[2:40:15] am and isain
[2:40:19] men for men in things pertaining to
[2:40:23] God to reconcile men back to
[2:40:27] God because he a man he understands
[2:40:31] their failure he understands their
[2:40:34] wickedness what has happened is that the
[2:40:37] Holy Spirit came down and awakened
[2:40:43] his which had the character of
[2:40:47] the and then anointed
[2:40:51] it through to come into the
[2:40:54] level of Christ the high
[2:40:57] priest who stands between the people and
[2:41:01] their
[2:41:03] [Applause]
[2:41:04] judgment and that's what we have
[2:41:07] suffer and verse three says he can have
[2:41:13] [Applause]
[2:41:15] compassion on the ignorant
[2:41:23] and on them that are out of the
[2:41:26] way so the Old Testament
[2:41:30] priest gives us an
[2:41:33] inight on what the ministry of
[2:41:37] Christ the high
[2:41:39] priest is and that
[2:41:43] Ministry works now in the image of a
[2:41:48] shepher
[2:41:50] reconciling
[2:41:51] reconciling
[2:41:53] reconciling we know what he does
[2:41:58] ignorant he teaches them those who are
[2:42:01] out of the way reconciles them that's a
[2:42:05] shepher so in doing his
[2:42:08] ministry the Old Testament
[2:42:10] priest required
[2:42:14] compassion dealing with
[2:42:17] ignorance that out of
[2:42:21] he is our
[2:42:24] shadow
[2:42:26] for the
[2:42:31] she so the local pastor we deal with all
[2:42:35] the
[2:42:37] weaknesses and failures to build the
[2:42:40] character amen are you going to work
[2:42:44] with
[2:42:44] him amen as he works with your families
[2:42:49] works with
[2:42:50] you you know he's a burden
[2:42:53] bear when he comes to your house
[2:43:01] don't he there because
[2:43:04] Hees amen you are his
[2:43:08] ministry without you he has no
[2:43:12] Ministry Amen Let me close with
[2:43:16] this but you see in Church there's the
[2:43:21] pastor and that Pastor is a special
[2:43:27] Pastor he's built
[2:43:30] where he can put up with the forces of
[2:43:33] the
[2:43:35] people a burden
[2:43:37] Bearer is the ox of the
[2:43:40] team he's the man that can sit
[2:43:43] down when somebody has got something
[2:43:46] against another
[2:43:49] and sit with them two families and rason
[2:43:53] it out and bring it back right
[2:43:57] in a pastor he knows how to take care
[2:44:03] of are you together with me is
[2:44:08] instructed not to lose any
[2:44:12] sheep I have lost
[2:44:15] none a Shepherd is a in
[2:44:22] Ministry so we thank
[2:44:24] God that he has given us a pastor that I
[2:44:30] believe will be able to understand the
[2:44:33] conditions of the
[2:44:35] eror and be able to drive the
[2:44:38] church God bless
[2:44:40] you God

[2:44:55] voice brother

[2:45:01] shepher is not there to
[2:45:06] scatter is there to
[2:45:09] keep what God has given him and
[2:45:14] protected so we thank
[2:45:17] God that we've got a man who has not
[2:45:20] come through the
[2:45:22] window climb through a
[2:45:25] ventilator he has come through the
