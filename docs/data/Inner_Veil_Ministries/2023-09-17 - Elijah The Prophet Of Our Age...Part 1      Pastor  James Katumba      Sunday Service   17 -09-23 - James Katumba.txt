stand up yes sister you're welcome we shall be doing baptism after this service is there another person to be baptized if you have never received water baptism yes you're welcome also says yesterday I was thinking already we need to challenge ourselves at least invite somebody to come with you to church brought somebody this week what about others praise the name of Allah talk to the your colleagues talk to your fellow students talk to your neighbors talk to your family members who have not yet believed and come with them to church even the person who helps you never know talk to them you know everybody needs Christ and at the end of the road it's not the houses we have that are going to matter it's not the joke that we have that are going tomorrow it's not the education with God that's going to matter it's not you know the people we've brought on us husband I've married or wife of marriage but what will matter if you get into the new life because which person have you brought it praise the name of it we're not going to have new house we're not carrying anything from us here is brought to Christ so you need to challenge yourself how many have you brought to christu you may not be able to preach to them but to encourage them come and we'll go with you to church and that can open their eyes including the female Pastor who is he so see how you can take charge over rate they don't know Wednesday we had the meeting in China then on Thursday we had meetings Friday and Saturday we had a meetings including the past of the church and you know God is opening up those in such a special way so we just really need to see that we keep on praying the Lord continue working out and likewise your support is needed no foreign [Laughter] have an overnight prayer here last week

pray together with them what schools have opened but officially they are meant open tomorrow so we shall pray for the schoolgoers at the end of the service now on Sunday 15 so I would call upon every one of us it's only I think about three or four Sundays from now this Sunday is Saturday no probably so I would call upon your contribution brother Peter will always does that job of helping us on males oh no issues of you know handling finances and the buying stuff and everything because sometimes uses this money to fill the gaps I would call upon every one of us to contribute for those meetings and then you give your contribution to brother Peter yeah the Bible says it is more blessed to give than to received praise the name of Allah then I also want us to clap for the use amen amen brother Joshua sent to me the what the youth have done this year the equipment they've purchased ones they bought a keyboard at 2.5 million Shillings they bought a bass guitar at 700 000 Shillings they bought a mixer at 700 000. they bought a solo guitar at 500 000. they bought these mics at four hundred and eighty thousand dollars they bought other mics which are used at 462 000. obviously community and they bought you know different kind of things that bought but good the list is still continuous but all together from the beginning of this year they have contributed seven million that have spent it on the equipments [Applause] we want to appreciate all those who are generous in supporting that needs some years but then the needs are continuous so he told me he wrote to me that there is a need of about 2 million shillings to buy one metal case at one million to buy one metallic case where they can stage them and things like that while foreign we are going to have our youth concert in January 2024. why are they choose bring original compositions so I call upon every person not only the use but pray to God to give you an inspiration and then you write a song and then you come and sing it we shall have a particular desert in the month of January and because there are so many programs in December we wouldn't want to conflict with other fellowships maybe 21st January or 28th January foreign father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we again thank you Father for the things that you do in our meetings the burdens that you put upon our hearts that we can't be in your services all the time I pray for more grace that you may help every one of us to find their positions and also perform the work you've ordained us to do as we build the kingdom of God strengthen every one of us and bless all the people that participate generously also help us in every challenge to be used of your father do what is right and pleasing unto you now commit the reading and the preaching of the words the words of foreign praise the name of our Lord and then we read in verse 5 and verse 6. the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and grateful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse words I want to talk about a subject the Elijah the prophet of our day area praise the name of our Lord I want to appreciate brother Wilson since last Sunday has been going in this area and I'm also put of God has put a burden upon my hands to speak about the same you know we really talk it here in church but normally when we go to the missionary fields we take time talking to them about the message that God has sent us and many times we Overlook the people in the church yet we have many new people who keep on coming in the church and they may not know why are we doing this now you know God katonda uses the spirit of Elijah five times in the scriptures God uses the spirit of Elijah five times in the scriptures now the first time God used the spirit of Elijah Was Elijah himself and that was in first Kings chapter 17. and then verse and then the scripture says who was of the inhabitants [Music] as the Lord God of Israel leave us there shall not be due nor a Reign this year according to my foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] as if the sins of jeroboam were too small he kept on adding one thing after another question the Bible says he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Isabel yes he was looking for beauty praise the name of Allah he was looking for how good somebody is how attractive somebody like in the days when the sons of God looked at the daughters of men and they were very famous [Music] and then the Bible says he went down and served [Music] now in other words he was making other gods in addition to the gods of Jeremiah I have added other gods of the region he he built the Bible says and he worshiped in addition to the other gods that jeroboam brought him they took us then the Bible says he went again and the rare than Altar for bad in the house which he had built in summary made a Groove which thing God had rejected and the Bible says the Lord God of Israel foreign he built Jericho he laid the foundation in abilam his first born I said the gates thereof in his youngest son according to the word of the Lord is spoke by Joshua the son of noon you know Joshua told them not to build Jerry yes and when he was building he killed his first born to put the foundation after building it he killed his last born they told me to put the gates that was then God sends Elijah the prophet the condition of all that kind of sins and he said there shall not be Reigns praise the name now we also need to look what the condition we are living we are living in the last box we are living in the Rhodesian Church age the Bible says in Revelations and then verse 14. foreign [Applause] was born on the day of Pentecost and Christ is coming to pick it up in the rapture [Applause] [Applause] was a prophet foreign now this is a personal question to every one of us how many of us have got the seven Church age how many of us don't have the seven Church each book English or Uganda what the language you understand yes yes then the church foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] has done foreign [Music] [Music] at the end time foreign [Applause] they have put Christ outside of the church when they talk about the seeds not the word of God no longer interested in the world they will even deny what is written they don't care what you are moving Christ is outside the Bible says the scriptures foreign you see like most of these gospel musicians everybody says I'm a pastor what is the one going to not see famous clubs to entertain with sexual musicians and then some of them bring the secular musicians demon-possessed people to come on to sing for the people around to Christ praise to outside of the church and something like we had recently and somebody said I'm organizing a holy concert and then he brought a sexual musician an essential musician was on the front portrait um and then for him he stood here and let me put holy concerts Crystal outside of the church [Applause] so we see it's the same condition like it was in the days so that it is and this is the condition of the church they think it is a small thing they think it's a small things [Applause] foreign [Applause] there was some secular music playing maybe it was a disco somewhere or some open place I don't know it was in the night now when again I woke up at five times they were putting on gospel music and I was wondering vultures praise the name of us they feed on the rotten things and then they won't feed on the rights but that's the condition today that until they go to disco and then the songs to use for worship and that's when the time the songs they are using to hug one another when they are dancing foreign [Applause] and then the church has its own testimony yeah verse 17 of Revelation three okay because those sayings I am rich and increased with God that's the testimony of the church I'm rich prosperity [Applause] now if you're preaching Prosperity Gospel what will you preach to a rich man um oh you think the rich are not in sin obviously if you are preaching salvation for people to go to America America When You Reach America now for your preaching about the Visa Visa how about somebody who has got a green card of USA permanent resident in USA what are you going to preach Christo outside they are building the astric kingdoms instead of building the kingdom of God which cannot end praise the name so Christ is outside of the church so it is under such a condition that God sends a messenger in this generation it is such a condition that God sends Elijah the president we sense you know you look what the condition of the church is that they have left the truth they have denied the truth the condition of the church they refused baptizing in the right way praise the name of us they baptize in the name of the Father the titles actually but his father name is when Jesus was stating the 11 Apostles go and baptize in the name of the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost how did the apostles do it foreign repent every one of you in the name of the name for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the house so the name of Jesus Christ Christian Acts chapter 19 and then verse 2. and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed when my kids and they said unto him we have not so much as Hardware that there be a Holy Ghost and to what way are you baptized don't worry about times that they should believe on him we should come after him that is on Christ Jesus Christ when they had this we were baptized in the name of the Lord [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] deception on Deception they get little children at the moment they scare the mothers if your child dies is going to hell are you the one taking the child to hell yeah when the scripture says in Matthew chapter 18. and then verse 2. and Jesus called a little child unto him yes and set him in the midst of them very I say unto you remember committee except you'll be converted and be as the little children you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven suffer the little children and foreign and then you scare the mothers what is that is deception praise the name of Allah to be baptized the Bible says in Luke chapter 24 and that repentance Luke chapter 24 verse 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations repentance and remissioners praise the name of God but you can never repent if you have not had the gospel Mark chapter 16. and then in verse 16. foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] they call them Godly Parents and then they come and confess for the child deception praise the name of it so there was no baptism of little children and even the baptisms they sprinkle water in the foreign Romans chapter six and then verse 3. no ye not entertainment that so many of us were baptizing into Jesus we are baptized into his deaths [Music] therefore we are buried with him by baptism into deaths [Music] that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father foreign [Applause] foreign we've looked in he looked any in the First Kings praise the name of Allah and we said that Elijah came here when the mess was too much so now Elijah played this part and then going towards Elijah let us go to First Kings again First Kings chapter 19. and then verse foreign to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of Shaffer of abelo shout though anoint be a prophet in thy room um told Elijah get Elisha the prophet and let him wear prophet in your room so Elijah had to follow Elijah praise the name of it Elisha had to follow area and so now when Elijah was going to be taken up in heaven Elisha asked Elijah oh Elijah asked Elisha it is what shall I do for you second Kings chapter 2 verse 9. and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for you before I beat Tekken meaning away from you and Elijah says let a double portion of your spirit be upon me everyday if those saw me when I am taken from you but if not it shall not be and it came to pass as they went on the road that behold there appeared The Chariot of Fire if you see me this is where it's interesting you know when Elijah was ascending into heaven he told the line there is a possibility for you to see me praise the name of us there is a possibility and now put it Elisha Edison his eyes were on Elijah even if Elijah says hunger you put aside [Music] battle [Applause] Elijah foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] soccer [Applause] for it shall be great in the sight and shall drink neither wine or strong even from his mother and many of the children of Israeli turn unto the Lord and He Shall go forth before him in the spirit and the power of the
