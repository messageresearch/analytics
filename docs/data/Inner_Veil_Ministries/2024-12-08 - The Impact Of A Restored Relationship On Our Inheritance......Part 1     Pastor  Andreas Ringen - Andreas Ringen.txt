undivided attention escort team with your amen so that we may move together amen it's very important so we've got two services and we are going to use the veteran interpreters today [Music] and they pretend like they are not hearing me so in the morning we having brother Samson luo he can come over and come and work with our brother as brother Emma prepares to do the work this evening I welcome

each and everyone amen and surely brother Steven and his wife family it's some uh sometimes amazing how God uh is able to connect people amen amen and you surely have understood we are one great family and we we have one father is that right we have one father we have a different color but still we have one father hallelujah hallelujah and I just want to say there is no first second or third world [Music] Believers amen the elect are the are the Believers of God's world [Music] amen and that's where we are going back too amen God bless you all so happy to be back again amen and have the privilege to uh um it's such a privilege to live in these last days amen such a privilege only to be here and that God allows us to see what is going on and not to see what is going on only but to be a part of the unveiling amen am just just think of it think of it you you might have not much money you might not have much wealth but what you have is eternal amen and we are here at the final stage and and we know as it was in the in the in the in the wedding in the Bible the best wine came at the end so so God has kept you go God has God has uh waited for you to come in this hour and what a great privilege to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen God bless you all so I'm I'm just trying to relax myself amen so and we don't want to stress it's fine we don't want to stress this morning too much we have two Services I'm trying to skip the the meeting into two two parts amen because we really want to be we really want to be a part of it Hallelujah we we this today it's not just only sermons and subjects anymore it must be something that we see in our lives this will work Monday this will be a reality on Tuesday amen amen because we are here you are here to express Jesus Christ all that God was he put in in in Christ that was 2,000 years ago he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and now the fullness but Jesus had no time to express it all he had no time that's why brother bam said he left certain things special for us in the final stage to unveil things of God that was hidden from before the foundation of what a great time it is unveiling of God God bless you amen are you ready for the word amen can we give him a hand of praise our God is good amen amen amen hallelujah it's not about the minister te it's just all about him what I wouldn't preach I would not stand here if this message would not have come amen I preach because the message came my way so all about Jesus Christ it all all about the message of the hour not about a person not about the doctrine it's all about Jesus Christ amen to him be the honor and the glory amen God bless you as we stand let us turn to the to the Bible and we want to go to want to read from the book of Galatians Galatians something that was really impressed on my heart to go on this on this line again amen because because it's it's a further unfolding as we said over the years you see we known one another now for quite some years and it's it's it's actually very good because you see you will see that the minister here in the front has a growing Revelation I tell the people at home what I preached 20 years ago don't compare it to what I preach now because it's a growing Revelation amen I heard a minister once say I never changed what I preached in 30 [Music] years and I thought I changed much I F sorry for the brother because it shows there's no growing Revelation amen amen so we should not be ashamed that we are in a learning process that we are living in a growing revelation so because it's not about the minister It's All About Him amen we have our time here we come and we go Minister comes and Minister goes but this word is eternal this word will stand so I just want to speak this morning on the subject and I want to maybe put it in two parts this morning we want to start with it and this afternoon maybe we want to try to finish it up I want to speak on the impact of a restored [Music] relationship on our inheritance amen the impact of restored relationship on our inheritance and our inheritance is the promised land amen amen amen our inheritance is the promised land amen all the promised land is is our in amen Galatians 4 we want to read from the verses 3 to 7 oh let's read from from verse one now I say that that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all now but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father so it's not the time appointed of the Sun but the time is appointed of the father so it is not you declaring you ready it is the father declaring they are ready it's a time appointed of the father hallelujah hallelujah isn't that wonderful because God knows we have our ups and downs but God has no ups and downs Hallelujah his love is not wavering his mind about you is not changing hallelujah hallelujah so so if the son would make the time appointed maybe he would never think he's ready that's why the father has to appoint the time even so when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the [Music] world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law [Music] to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of [Music] sons and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying father [Music] amen amen so if you have received the Holy Ghost it shows plainly you are a son amen it shows plainly you are a son you didn't became a son but because you are Sons God sent the Holy Spirit wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen I just like that an heir of God through Christ amen let's say that together air of God I am an heir of God that's why he died that's why Jesus Christ died amen God bless you let's turn to Genesis 1 scripture Genesis 5 amen Genesis 5 we want to read only one verse 4 this might be our winding up this evening amen beautiful scripture and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him why he was not because God took him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why there will be a Rapture because God will take you Hallelujah let us pray Heavenly Father such a great privilege what we have come to Father it's a such a joy that you allowed us to live in this hour at the end you promised you will the mystery of God will be finished and we see today Christ was the mystery of God that mystery of God is finished is complete is unveiled speak to us this morning I father that has such an impact on each and everyone May that had have an impact on the sick people impact on bound people impact on struggling people such an impact father that it may heal them all set them free all deliver them all because you have sent forth your words and you have healed them we pray father we commit ourselves into your hands may this service be to your honor and to your glory ask it in Jesus Christ name amen amen amen God bless you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now Hallelujah we want to speak on on uh on the impact of restored relationship and and we understand that in that as we speak of relationship and as we speak of inheritance we want also to understand that our inheritance is completely based on what kind of relationship you [Music] have that's that's the way your inheritance will be amen take a take a normal family they have family you have uncles you have whatever relatives and so if there's something if there's something you to to to give out as an inheritance what kind of relationship you have to the one that is the owner will declare your inheritance amen amen this is I think very plain The Inheritance is based on [Music] relationship amen that's why we can see the connection the Son and the father so we are hirs of God through Jesus Christ amen so but really the the we want to we want to really see what what relationship that it was from the beginning and we want to see the difference uh why the enemy has not a relationship to God yet God has made him but the enemy has no relationship that's why he has not an inheritance amen and you have an inheritance because you have a relationship hallelujah hallelujah and the closer the relationship is the greater The Inheritance will be Hallelujah the closer your relationship is to God you can have different relationships to God God can be God can be your creator you know that's wonderful many people they believe in God but they have no relationship to for them God is just some far away being some maybe some Spirits some unseen power but if it is that to you you will have no inheritance that's why you can people they say they believe in God but they manifest nothing and they manifest nothing because they have no relationship what you are manifesting what you are able to manifest you can only manifest what you are amen we cannot We cannot put ourselves different feather in you know different feathers to to make us a different bird we are what we are because of the relationship we have to God hallelujah so so this will this will be the day and we will see what kind of inheritance that is and I I and I want to start actually with something that I many times have read what the prophet said in concluding his goal what he wanted to reach in his ministry in his life what his purpose was and and and I think that is very striking brother Ram said in the in the in the church age book and he is closing the church age do you believe the church age book is brother brenham's book yet it is written by Brother L and brother Brenham said it is my book it is my book is that right I mean that's very important because we have to take take it from him am amen and here brother brandham concludes in the church hbook the final statement the church ages the resume of the ages Hallelujah and remember brother Ram understood who he was he understood his position actually in the church body he understood that he was the church age messenger to the Lan churches amen is it not amazing that brother rham called uh called called uh the church let me let me let me make no mistake how brother bham would call [Music] it that's very amazing brother bham would call the the zadan church AG brother bham would call Luther AG he would call the Philadelphia Church age he would call wesl age but he never would call the last Church age Bram age because no Prophet no real Prophet will make himself important he will always make others important and if if you want to find out someone that really has a Ministry is the one that isn't making him [Music] important if you have to make yourself important I wonder what kind of ministry you have amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now listen here's brother random and in the conclusion of the church age [Music] book brother vam is saying not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or organization [Music] I've never done that and I will not do that now listen I have no interest in those [Music] things amen amen so that was not brother Ram's final goal to start a briak Bram campaign a big group to make Jeffersonville the headquarter Jeffersonville is not our headquarter our headquarter is heaven brother and Heaven is consists of the word amen hallelujah he said but I have I have an interest in the things of God and people people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied what a statement from a man that had that had signs God gave him signs God gave him much more than Moses had he had gifts he could pray for the sick he it right and here that man came and he said but if I gu can accomplish one thing I will be satisfied and then one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men because we have lost our relationship we came into this world by sexual desire we reive we received a spirit human spirit that was permitted by God hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen do you know that brother bam said when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive that spirit that you should have received from the beginning amen amen so that one thing established true spiritual relationship between God and man [Music] established or allow me to say restor but to really establish something is that you go back to what you were amen hallelujah hallelujah listen very carefully how where in man become a new creation in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his words so as the relationship is restored or established people become new creatures in Christ hallelujah hallelujah and they receive the Holy Ghost because we understand because you are Sons the Holy Spirit comes to you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't make you a son Paul said because you are Sons because you we Sons the Holy Spirit comes now to you why does the Holy Spirit comes to you because your your relationship to God is being reestablished it's restored and in that reestablishing process the Holy Spirit comes to you so you cannot miss it that's why brother Ram said the Holy Spirit wants to come more to you then you want to receive it hallelujah hallelujah what a statement we understand we grow we grow out of the Pentecostal understanding I would call it the baby understanding as the CH sorry that's not neglecting or making Paul would say when I was a child I spoke like a child is it right I spoke like a child I thought like a child but then when I became a man I put that child is thinking and child is talking were put away why because now I speak as a grown man amen and this is what God wants God wants to talk to us this morning not to little babies anymore to about every wind of dark little children in the sense babies in the sense that they don't know if God loves them or not as soon as they make as soon as they make a mistake they feel God is not loving them anymore and God is tired God is tired sending us the message and then people acting still like [Music] this as as the young people singing surely we fall the prophet said we backslide every day we still living in a human body that needs a change living in a dying body and the dying spirit uh-huh that's why we fall daily but you know what happens you fall as you fall you quickly stand up again Satan can get you to fall every day because he puts thought in your mind and you accept those thoughts so easy this is how we fall accepting Satan's ideas Satan's thoughts and remember Satan is very clever he comes to you is it is written amen you understand come on but you know what happens as as we as the young people and and the sister was singing as soon as you fall you don't hit the ground that's why Satan sooner or later gets upset and he don't know what to do with you anymore because as you soon as you fall you come up again soon as you fall you come up again soon as you fall you come up again the just man he follows but he stands up again he stumbles but he rises up again hallelujah hallelujah and this is where where we are now and and uh and and and you will you will see you will understand what we need so we are not we are not little little children anymore that when we when we that that when we fall we stay on the ground crying angry and up angry and upset about our mistakes we don't talk like children anymore hallelujah hallelujah and you know this is what God wants to hear from us this morning he told to job one day guard up your loins to me like a man he asked Y where were you as a little baby when you hear those words you starts wondering where you were where you were but when you are grown you know exactly what that voice means when God said where were you you understand I was there amen hallelujah hallelujah amen and God wants to and remember there's the blood of Jesus Christ able to cover every mistake to cover every sin am so as you stand under the blood God only hears your voice amen God only hears your voice but I I want to ask you a question what voice is he hearing that morning this morning what voice from you comes out under the blood what voice you're speaking back to him God has a desire to talk to his church about serious matters Hallelujah God wants to share his glory with the church he's tired of speaking to children hallelujah hallelujah amen the Bible says we are sinners all of us saved by grace and when you are saved by grace you're not a sinner anymore then don't talk to him like you are still a [Music] [Applause] sinner amen you understand you understand when I was a child I spoke like a child spoke as a child my I I have my own family my own children my boys the ones they were once small when they were very small you know they were just talking funny things you know how they begin to start making words and then they they they they just finally could say Papa and Mama and as parents was little baby we were excited because now they could speak Papa and Mama but if my my my grownup boy today comes to me and my wife the only thing he can tell us he said Papa Mama I'm not so happy with him I'm not happy with him is is that correct when I was a child I was happy with him but when he's grown up come on Church come on Church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and this is what God is when we were children Pentecost was the birth of the church that's why they all speak in a tongue and they were moved but God don't want to hear that today what God wants to hear today from the church is not only no there's nothing wrong with it don't misunder understand nothing wrong with that but go on from there go on from there go on from there learn from there don't always go back to Baby status he understand we can still go in the permissive will of because of little children because of Too Young God may allow you but what I found out is if we stay too long in what God permits it weakens us if we stay too long in what God permits because we are still acting as little children if you stayed too long in that permissive it will weaken you it will weaken finally your faith or if you had time we could go into into things how David be became weakened became weakened because he was going on God's [Music] permissive things that God allowed God had allowed to have many wives God had allowed that is that right and so David was going on that line he was he was not when when the battle was he was not in the front line but when the Kings went to battle when the Kings went to battle David stayed home Hallelujah now we don't go with this line because but but we have to understand we have to understand that that there was we had different anointings is that right different anointings to the church ages is that correct we see the first two in the beginning it was a lion anointing then we understand it was the ARX anointing then we see it came the eagle anointing the man man anointing and then at the end because as the enemy comes in like a flood God has to raise the amen God has to raise the standards that's why in the ministry of William brandham you can see a change of an anointing a change from an anointing brother Ram actually started under man anointing but there came a Time Revelations 10 the prophet called him the ego when the eag anointing took over and how many people want to go back today under man anointing and you understand as a good father is when little Johnny one so bad to have that tool to play with Father might allow it I hope you understand amen I hope you understand so we people today but to me as we are grown up we are not like little children anymore so that we want to play with something God has given and maybe show with that anointing how powerful we are only little children children try to show and manifest who they are look what I can fighting in the sandbox against brothers and sisters showing who they are taking the tool of the daddy and with that tool trying to show how big they are to me this is childish playing and God because he loves his children he might permit you to work under a past anointing but if you stay too long under that if you play too long was a tool it weakens your growth come on Church it weakens your growth and I want my children getting out of the sandbox playing with the tools I gave them I want my children today in my business not playing in the sandbox anymore not playing in the kindergarten anymore but I want them to be with me in my kingdom so I can say if you see them you see me he can do the same thing I have done actually actually my son is a continuation of myself Hallelujah hallelujah amen this is what God wants to see today God God don't want to hear from us you know as you are fallen and as you are a a young young believer if you make a big mistake and Satan comes around and he can tell you you make so many mistakes you God God don't love you anymore God but this is childish thinking amen when I was a child I spoke as a child I acted as a child but when the time came the time of adoption came I put away childish thinking hallelujah amen you understand that and and and and as we see as as the the Lord is is is going or or how it is continuing I'm just feeling impressed to go back to my subject Amen to to uh to to go to go back to really to show what it is but is this is what God wants to hear today and and as as I said because it's so important that we understand God wants to bring us God wants to have a relationship to man that he lost in the Garden of Eden that he lost in the Garden of Eden hallelujah amen amen that relationship exists between God and man do you believe that amen there was a relationship that exist between God and man amen in this relationship brother Bron wanted to see established [Music] again it will help you to quicker stand up if you are Fallen remember how the devil is so clever he makes you to fall he puts that thought in your mind and because of circumstances you don't discern quick enough that it is the enemy and you find yourself in a fallen condition amen and as he makes you fall he comes around and condemns you for what he has done because you didn't make your own fall see if brother Samson is going if he walks just walk and if I put his legs away and he falls on the ground and then they come around and tell him oh you are Fallen you understand and then brother Samson on the ground if he's not grown up he feels stupid he feels unable he said my goodness how stupid I am no you are not stupid somebody make you fall and you understand as he may lay down weeping feeling unworthy feeling not able why can I not walk he stays down he stays down and this is where Satan wants to keep you he wants to keep you down amen he don't want you to know who you are but I tell you how quickly even if I make brother Samson to four if he know who he is and he knows what is going on and he knows who make him fall he will not lay on the ground but she quickly come out and walk on and one day Satan gets so tired because he cannot get you to the ground anymore as soon as you fall you come up you know why brother Samson would come up quickly when he knows who he is when he knows what he can come on church he knows I was always able to walk Come On Church we're coming back to a relationship where you always were like God somebody can say amen hallelujah hallelujah when God created you created you not from nothing he created you from himself hallelujah hallelujah I I I hope you understand when he created Satan uhhuh from nothing that's why Satan is going back to nothing but when he created his church when he created Adam when he created you he created you from something he created you from existence come on church he made you from himself as he made woman from the man amen hallelujah hallelujah sometimes that word creation can be a little confusing Satan can come around and he can tell you I'm also created he can tell you you know who my Creator is so he can tell you the same one that created you created me so what you understand and he's right he can even quote Ezekiel 28 you see I was perfect come on Church created perfect then you must have an answer are you not glad that God gave us the answer in this hour he showed us where we come from and he showed us and you can tell Satan Satan we don't have to argue about this you just have to accept that I come from God from an existence and you come from God from nothing [Applause] we go a little later you will understand how brother Adam even telling their people today on [Music] Earth that God don't know you can tell Satan God don't know you there was a group of people that came to him and he had to tell them they told him they told God we have done so many things in your name you know what he said I don't know you sure you know [Applause] us here we go here we go here we understand surely God you know us you made us you created us and yet he could tell them I don't know you but I created you from nothing come on we don't have to argue with God God is God and he can do whatever he wants he do not have to have my permission he do not have to have your permission he doesn't need Satan's permission he can do whatever he wants and if he decided to create me out of himself then it was his decision oh we go there a little later but you will understand we have the answer to Satan's questions Hallelujah I think that's so important because as I said if brother Samson is falling and maybe the 10 time he's falling he feelsy and the enemy is very clever you know you know sometimes how when we were little children or younger younger teenagers we had a little game we was walk with one another and somebody was just little kicking and the other one Tumbl you know I don't know if you do the same thing in Africa we had so it was not who did this who tried to bring me to fall and as you were walking youed little little with a leg kick little in the back this is what Satan is doing as you walk in his sight he talks to you and they kick and then you fall come on church this is how he's doing it and then you tumble you stand up you tumble you stand up and after 10 times nearly fall you think am I so stupid this is what happens to many people Satan makes them fall so many times and finally they stay on the ground start crying to Papa I cannot walk now what is God doing he's not playing childish games with us you know what he's doing he shows you pictures of yourself when you could walk before you came here to Earth and he tells you as soon as Satan makes you fall remember that picture because from the beginning Hallelujah when you were created when Adam was created he was not created a baby when God made you he didn't make you a baby [Applause] come on church when he formed when he made the woman out of the man even the byproduct came as a full grown woman come on church not as a little baby no as a beautiful matur [Applause] lady Hallelujah Hallelujah so you understand as as enemy makes you fall hear that church it's very important it's very important because this is what Satan is trying to do getting the church the True Believers to live below their privilege making them fall making them fall and with this modern media what we have today young people which is modern media what we have today how quickly he can get you to [Music] fall so more and more we need this to know when you are when you are fallen or when you are stumbling go back to the picture that God sent to you about yourself in this [Music] this is who you [Applause] were come on church this is who you were before the foundation of the [Applause] world in him do you believe you wear an attribute in him do you believe you were an attribute who can believe he was an attribute oh my oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram would say God make made a picture of you when you were in your [Music] best is that correct and the prophet came or allow me to say the book became open and out of the open book that means there's no no seal upon it so if you seal wrapped away seal is hiding what is inside and remember brother Ram is telling the nice story of that of that of that of that poor woman [Music] that had a rich son it was a doctor somewhere in India and he was that woman living in poverty you know the story that woman living in poverty that old lady living in poverty and she was she was too proud to go to social welfare like it is with many people they're too proud to go to social welfare and was she was living in poverty but there were some people amongst the officials some official people they knew exactly that woman has a wealthy boy so one one day they came to the lady because they they saw she had no firewood they they saw she had hly clothes they saw she was poor and they they ask her lady you know we know you have a rich son is your son never caring for you oh she said he's a wonderful boy every months he thinks on me and the people said what do you mean he think of she said every month he sends me nice [Music] pictures come on Church come on Church hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my oh my can a mother forget her suckling child she might forget but allow me to say she can never forget her grownup son this is another sermon in itself Hallelujah and here the one of the officer said he he sent you pictures but you don't need pictures you need food and clothes she said he's such a nice boy he writes such nice letters every time he sends me so beautiful pictures with his and one of the officers said can you show me the pictures oh she said yes so she went the prophet said she went to her Bible yeah come on Church opened the book hello hello hello hello hello and in those Bible where all nice pictures about [Music] yourself do you understand what the open book means so for that old lady these nice pictures where Bank [Music] notes Bank her has taken care so much for her and church the son of the Living God taking so much care for us because he came down the lamb was worthy to open the book he came down is that right open the book is that correct so now your wealth Who You Are can come out of the book hallelujah hallelujah so if you are if Satan makes you fall again just this will go to the end because brother Bram said in these bodies in these bodies we will have problems to the end because they need still Redemption is that right that's why we need a body change we living in dying bodies with dying Spirits that's why in these days so so many mental problems out there brother sister if you are mentally struggling that is not you you are on the inside hallelujah hallelujah you understand how brother Brandon would say somebody that is insane can have the Holy Ghost come on Church you better believe that yeah come on church because we're living in a dying body and the ding come on Church yes you better say Amen you might be so weak in your spirit brother Bram came to a point when he was so weak in his human [Music] Spirit come on church so weak so weak you know how weak he became you know why the devil could tell him God don't love you anymore brother bam said Satan couldn't tell me that there is no God because I know there is a God we all know that there is a God is that right we have seen it so many times we know there is a living God but he could get brother brandham because of brother Bram making a mistake he could get brother brandham mentally solo telling him telling him because of your mistakes God don't love you anymore and if you accept that you stay on the ground come on church but I would deny it because the Bible tells us God tells us that his love is divine hallelujah hallelujah as we as we I thinking it's it's very important God is not loving you as a father human speaking would love his son God's love is elective love somebody can say amen that's why God cannot love you more [Music] and God can never love you less you can see that amen can you say praise the Lord stay stay focused God loved you when you were still a sinner this is what the Bible tells when you became a Christian when you repented when you get baptized do you think God loved you [Music] more God cannot love you more because his love is divine when God cannot love you more as parents when our children bring honor to us seems we love them much what do you do if your child brings this honor to you come on we would love it less is that right right come on Church yes this is what not so God God cannot love you more and he cannot love you less because God's love is [Applause] elective you know how you know that God loves you because he chose you that's his love to [Music] you regardless what [Music] matters good days are not a sign that God might be pleased with you bad days is not a sign that God is displeased you know how brother brandham gets so low in church as we are in a neurotic age also here in Africa you see lot of crazy people yes you see them so we living in a neurotic age is that right in this neurotic age in this crazy world brother Ram would say literally they go crazy normality is abnormal and abnormality is [Music] normal you understand this is the world we are living in this is what is presented to you on social media that's why young people be very careful I'm not against things but I don't need Facebook I have I have my face in this book [Applause] and when I when when I say I I don't need I don't say it is a sin to have [Music] it I just said I don't need and I'm aware that with all these social media whatever that is this crazy world is influencing you and you cannot stop it come on Church you have your telephone there it comes there it comes it is a tree of Good and Evil is that right so even in the Garden of Eden God will tell them don't eat is it okay for me to say that use it but don't eat [Music] it use it as we have need of eating becomes one with it come on church allow me to say use it but don't eat [Applause] it amen because the influence of this crazy world you are constantly confronted with that and there's no hidden place in Uganda it is everywhere we are living in Satan's Eden do you believe that whatever corner of the world you are trying to hide we are living in Satan's Eden that's why I believe we needed this message so the standed can be raised Hallelujah so that we can stay normal literally you see the increase allow me to say that um I heard of brother Donnie Reagan brother Donnie Reagan they had a youth meeting just a couple of weeks ago or a family camp and they had a big prayer line for all the people especially the young people which is perfectly all right and brother Donnie said that later as the young people were coming you speak with them shortly what is your what is your and brother Donnie said at the end of the prayer line he he was like a little confused and he walked to his fellow brothers that had prayed with other young people he asked them this is on YouTube you can you can see this he asked his fellow brothers what was the main purpose that the young people came to you you know what it was more than 90% 95 per it's what's not so much cancer or or or backbone trouble 95% were mental struggle depression anxiety depression anxiety come on church this where we are there is where we are today we are living in a crazy world the mental pressure is rising and you wonder sometimes yourself where am I is that right that's why more than ever we need the reality of the message of the hour what is the message of the hour what is the message of the hour when the bride knows what it is and who she is the message of the hour is she is him the message of the hour is the father you are the father anding of God hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah and when you see your picture always before you that God make from you when you were in your best you understand you fall every day finally the devil tells you you could never walk you could never walk just tell him here is my picture what God made for me before I came here hallelujah tell him I I never had to learn walking I could walk from that moment that he made [Music] me you understand that have that picture of yourself constantly with you you will not fall so hard do you know why some people fall so hard they not only fall they fall hard and the harder you fall the longer you lay is that okay see somebody that falls very hard and he has a very hard time to get up but if you have your picture with you and what you could always come on Church it helps you not to fall too hard so as you are falling your picture comes up who you are and you rise up again and you start walking and one day Satan will be so tired he can do whatever he wants he cannot get you down [Applause] anymore hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my I tell you when that relationship is restored when that relationship is built up amen that relationship is being brought up oh you know how brother Bram would say he speak this little simple examples of that of that I think it was a young young young woman he said there were young man he was living in the in the with his parents more in a forest area in in a very simple area and when they wanted to have a morning bath washs and comb their hair they only had a piece of a mirror in their brother Bram would say Pentecostal understanding you understand that you're trying to look in it and trying he said but then the same person came into the City and and there the people that not only a Pentecostal mirror but there they had their open word [Applause] mirror and same child young person walked before the mirror in the beginning it was looking never had seen never had seen them second time was waving finally the courage was there to stand up and look to who you are that's [Applause] me that helps you when Satan tries to get you believe me we needed it in this hour where people go mentally crazy depressions are rising i i as a pastor I tell you in my own church at home the most challenges I have people having mental problems you know why we living in a crazy world and don't worry also Africa becomes crazy don't worry Al Africa becomes crazy come on and I have the impression Africa becomes quicker crazy than [Laughter] [Music] Europe so church just not to make fun we needed the word hallelujah you needed the message of the hour you had no hope in denomination because as you stay in denomination you only see you in that little spot you never see in full who you are that's why we have today in Africa such a run from denomination you know why people in denomination they understand with what we have we cannot make [Music] itall honestly many times we think we have to beg them to come out you better understand you better understand and many people seriously speaking have understood that their denomination has not an answer for the challenges of today is it right the only answer is Jesus Christ today unveiled it's only [Applause] chance Hallelujah h i speak of experience I speak of firsthand experience if I would not have this message if I would not had that received that Revelation I would not be here today when I was a young man 18 years old just came to the Lord I suffered from [Music] depression and I didn't know why I asked the Lord take it away from me why do I have that why is it there one day the Lord answered me why I have that while I was asking him again he said Lord why do I struggle always [Music] you know what you know what he told me because you're working with people that have that same struggle so you must know what it is you must know what helps you up and church I can promise you this is what brings me up every day this is how I can feed the enemy every day and going back to the picture that he made of me when I was at my best that picture before me Hallelujah forgetting all the things behind me Hallelujah the go the go before me hallelujah hallelujah for sure I can assure you your fall will not be very hard I know how is when you fall hard and when you fall H you have scars when somebody really Falls hard he comes up and he is scar is that right how many times we have seen that young people when they say they have fallen so hard they comes SC back so this is something that even if the Devil Makes You Fall you don't fall hard you quickly when the devil tries to get you and what is really nice or how how when you are really beautiful you know see especially in Africa it looks lot of paint and a lot of color to be Beau it looks like it looks like right so white man is not beautiful don't get me wrong but it looks like Satan can attract you very s with color makes you beautiful so and here you have social media here you have social media always telling you this is how you look when you're beautiful tell Satan back I have a better picture of myself beuty that you are showing me is lasting I show you a beauty and you what what how beautiful I am in that picture because I am Eternal and Eternity is my [Applause] beauty come on Church don't don't don't be don't be fooled hallelujah amen good that we have two parts amen we will not but you understand how how important that becomes young people yes hallelujah hallelujah yes can we give the the Lord a hand of Praise oh I'm so grateful you know why that's why I am here [Music] today without that I would not be here without this message I would be either in the world or in an instant institution yes but because of this words I'm standing [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen not only standing not only standing not only standing and surviving I an overcomer Hallelujah that means if I fall I'm still an overcomer even when I fall I'm still perfect even when I fall he's still still love me even when I fall I still love him hallelujah hallelujah you know why G why the enemy never could get Jesus to fall you know what Jesus key was even when he came to him with the word you know what Jesus key was and brother Bram said and he over as he overcame we [Applause] overcome not because of his virgin birth he could overcome then we would lost but Jesus said said Jesus overcame the same way that we can overcome Jesus knew who he was when the devil told him prove yourself who you are then he he to showed him the picture back I know who I am when you when you do this you will be beautiful Jesus told him I am already beautiful you understand that brother Ram said Jesus overcame because of the word he was the word and have you understood when the opening of the word came what book Adam lost was it the he lost his [Music] relationship come on and that book that relationship went back into the hands of the original [Music] owner can I say that God was again more alone with himself [Music] Hallelujah but his great desire was I don't want to be alone with myself I want to have man in my own image hallelujah hallelujah come on church and then in the last in the end time because of Jesus Christ amen The Inheritance came back to the church [Applause] again hallelujah hallelujah our time is nearly my allow me a few minutes then we continue this afternoon but we just want to show uh and I thought it was very very important that we really understand why this is necessary this is not for me this is not an option this message needed to come that's why God sent a prophet Vindicated him so that we would believe the message and if God tells you who you are using a prophet would you not believe him if I tell you you are perfect you might doubt you might doubt because you think I don't know you but if God if God tells you who you are would you believe if God tells you you are perfect do you believe God is perfect when you are a part of God how can you be different than perfect the church has to come to this position come on church because there's a body changting you see the other day California big earthquake not just few days ago that is 7.0 [Music] earthquake amen the prophet said the great great earthquake will come and you understand the West Coast slide in the ocean is that right you know what happens our bodies will be changed oh I'm so glad even in this sinful bodies in this elder getting older I tell you my human mind is not working as it was [Music] before many times I forget clothes I forget scriptures how in the world can I get changed come on Church you're all getting younger right I see some of the brothers here brother Emma 10 years ago he was younger brother brother Samson 10 years ago he was much younger we all got older a little bigger you know and not so quick anym brother Bram said he said the Rapture is going to happen but he said many people are too heavy that's what he said he said not too heavy in in weights I tell you I get a good body back when I get a new body all these over over stuff it go down to a perfect body but I don't want to be loaded and heavy with old understanding come on church we had brother we had brother Charles U well he you understand he has a problem with his kidneys do you believe he can be changed in the moment in the dreu is his f strong enough come on Church surely you understand even if you're sick and the devil tries to tell you your face is too weak come on how will you be changed not even having faith for your body come on church this is how he works he brings sickness to you and then he blames you for you to have it that's his game always amen you should tell him you should tell him even if these outside bodies what did Paul say if these outside bodies are getting down I have another one [Music] way hallelujah hallelujah because this is what you see it's not the real [Music] me hallelujah oh my my my we should answer the devil on [Music] that give me give me a few minutes just turn quickly to to Joshua 1 verse6 Joshua 1 verse6 because also we want to show that what we speaking of we need on this side of mortality uh Joshua 1 verse 6 see now now we start actually our first sermon because I quickly I want to lay a little bit of a of remember it's an impact of restored relationship [Music] Hallelujah on our inheritance and our inheritance is the promised land now watch now what God is telling to Joshua he said be strong and off a good courage For unto these people shall thou divide foreign inheritance the land you catch that he shall divite the land as an [Music] inheritance so the land was not given out as a free gift it was connected to an inheritance and inheritance is connected to a [Music] relationship with other words yes divide the land that's why a stranger that's why a stranger could not go into the land and say this is what I want to have and that is what I want to have it was only for those that were related is that not amazing so all the promised land all the inheritance is connected to a [Music] relationship take another scripture Joshua 11:23 want to read that again now now now we we will we will see what Joshua finally has done Joshua 11:23 Joshua took the whole land yeah bring it up whole land according to all that the Lord said unto Moses and Joshua gave it fore an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their [Music] tribes amen so the promised land come on Church The Inheritance the promised land shall be given out divided as an inheritance that means Satan has no rights on any of it everything that Satan was possessing he took it illegally he was actually a squatter on the ground that's why isra Israel went in and kicked the enemies out because that land belongs to them you know why it belongs to them because God gave it to them all the land all the land is God's land is it right all the land belongs to God but now God wants to give his land who he is as an inheritance not to Satan because only to those are part of the family oh my oh my oh my my my my you see if you we could stay here for hours just gleaning the Nuggets that is in the [Music] word the promise Land look listen promised land inheritance inheritance is connected to [Music] Testament is that correct yes come on it's a testament a testament that you leave [Music] who leaves us a testament who leaves us an inheritance can I read it very plain in the message position in Christ brother Ram said you have an inheritance by predestination because you were a part of God that's why you have an inheritance hallelujah hallelujah the prophet said I are you inherited something if I have an inheritance the prophet said do said Jesus left me in inheritance brother bam said Jesus never left me or you an inheritance hey we are not hires of Jesus we are airs we have read it together before we started we are hirs of God God through Jesus Christ Galatians 4 you're with me that's why brother B could say Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he came down and he paid for your inheritance brought you back to your inheritance Oh What a Beautiful quote but you in brought you to your inheritance but your name who you are was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now that book get open that book became open what comes out pictures names who you are come out now you can say sat this is what God Said I am hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we we might have a little time this afternoon and I also want to make sure as Paul would say to the Hebrews for this cause Jesus Christ is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance hallelujah hallelujah we have an eternal inheritance my my my my my Hebrews 9:16 for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator [Music] for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strengths in the whole Testament as long as the test to Liv isn't that beautiful thank God for Jesus Christ you know that God God could not die so how in the world can the test be a force when God cannot die uhhuh that's why in Jesus Christ God could die and when Jesus Christ died God cried amen now all I am my people can be Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my time is running we not even have started really let me read to you brother what what the promised land listen many people refer the promised land to the Millennium many people think that we get our inheritance when our bodies are [Music] changed beautiful listen what he said it is not the promised land Wars and killings in the Millennium we will not have that that means our inheritance we receive here yes our inheritance what God wants to air we receive before the Millennium allow me to say that will finally change our bodies [Music] because the Rapture where is the rapture today in Africa a Rapture come from Germany where is your new body have I brought him too heavy to carry too many your new body is on your inside the Rapture is in you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen church one of these these days that's why we need this message for a [Applause] Rapture that's why we need this message to be changed we the message did not came to tell us that we must be born again we knew that before the message came but the message had to come you understand the message is so much more than just restoring some fundamental truth back to the church the message is so much more than the right water baptism come on what have you done after you have received the water baptism [Music] I trust all of us are baptized in the right kind of baptism if you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is a right kind of baptism but this is not what the message came for the message came as you came out as you came out of den Nation as you came out of Egypt is it right finally you come out of Egypt you got the right water baptism so now you can be introduced into the Promised lands that's why you came out that's why you came out of denomination not just to sit in a new denomination [Music] Hallelujah coming out of Egypt was necessary to go into Canaan amen who came out out of the world out of denomination who is ready now to go in to go into your inheritance [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you need the right kind of water baptism you need the Holy Spirit baptism so you become part of the family of God because this inheritance is a Family Matter Hallelujah [Laughter] amen oh isn't he wonderful time is running we still happy can we say praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah we says I'm closing the morning service I'm closing the morning service and then we will we will see in the afternoon really what a relationship restored means so if the one that is inheriting us something is not Jesus but it is the father is God Amen then we are not hes of Jesus we are hes of God through Jesus remember it was always God it was always God he started it hallelujah hallelujah before Jesus came on the scene that's why brother Ram could say Jesus had a beginning hallelujah hallelujah but here we have someone that had no beginning hold that for a moment you are Heirs of God it is the father trying to inherit oh yes yes yes here we go I have I don't have my wife with me I don't have my wife with me is always always God and his family you know God has Sons and Daughters God has Sons and [Music] Daughters is that right and God has a bride amen am is that right amen am do we believe that oh my you see if we it is always the father is it not marvelous that when Adam was there come again when Adam was there God looked at him and God said it is not good that man is alone it was not Adam telling the father father I think it's not good that I [Music] Al it was God looking down said it is not God because God knows how it is to be [Music] alone you know what alone means alone means all in one [Music] if you can write it it's a l all and then in o n e all in one that means [Music] alone so when God was alone it was all in one and God said it is not good that Adam is [Applause] all the Bible tells us come on Church the Bible tells us when finally the son has given all back to the father then he will be all in all in all then it's not all in one [Applause] [Music] anymore I don't know if you have the scripture there Hallelujah church can you get that the final stage that we are walking into eternity is God not being all in one now God is all in [Applause] all that's the whole story that's God's purpose that's why Jesus died hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah so it was always the father it was not it was not Adam saying oh God I feel so alone God looked to Adam I think Adam was quite happy because the woman would cause him only trouble the woman would cause him only trouble God looked at him and he said it's not good that man is alone I will make him you understand it is always God's business is it not is it not amazing our great love story of is it not amazing the great love story of Rebecca and Isaac you know one day Isaac oh he felt so lonely no no one day Abraham said son needs a wife I don't know what what I you know what I mean the Bible never said that Isaac had a word to it can you see this can you see the the principal so it was Abraham the father telling to elazar make sure wait a minute it was not Isaac telling in the beginning you know what God did to make really sure that we in 2024 understand that principle he put Adam in a deep sleep so that everybody will clearly understand the woman was not Adam's Choice the woman was not Adam's product the woman was not made by Adam the woman was not done by Adam what happened at Calvary God waited God waited so long till Jesus had died is that right finally he was dead because they wanted to break his bones and they found out he's dead already then God used even an enemy not a disciple they were cowards hiding somewhere but God used the enemy God is always using the enemy because many Believers are too much cowards he came an enemy and when they seen he was already they pushed the spear in and brother said there the bride came out of Hallelujah Hallelujah so Jesus Jesus is not making his own bride it is the father responsible God Made You he brought you here hallelujah can we call it as brother random would call it in the message invisible Union is said okay when I read that as closing then we let we start in the afternoon because I think that's beautiful to see the level of relationship what was the relationship between Adam and Eve they were one she came from him what is the relationship between the bride to Christ she's him she comes from him she's him in another [Music] form to express all that God is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I just have to read one quote because there's too many the prophet would say so you were sons of God and Daughters of God before there even was the moon in the star or molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God in the beginning [Music] for there only one form of eternal life and that was you [Music] before can we say Amen to that there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before to whom to whom is he speaking to me is he speaking to you who is at you can I see your hands there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your father's loins Ley Ley yet in the loins of Abraham is that right I mean I was in the Lo of my father and I know nothing about it but you know how I know I was because I see in me things that my father was so I know yeah I come from him H the prophet would say it is like an evolution he said look at this it's not Evolution like the schools tell us but an evolution is always God showing more of [Music] him like Luther sanctification justif justification under Luther sanctification under vesley the evolution of the spirit more and more because a body is building finally coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me read one quote and we are closing but I think that's so powerful statement of the Prophet listen in the message countdown 1962 he said he made first the trees and the botony life then he made man and then the last thing that ever come from the Earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever came because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven it

I enjoyed the ministers here they were following very closely and I thank God to that their impact the impact of our restored relationship of our inherit praise the Lord so we thank God for this service I really like the scripture that he read that when you're born potentially you are here but you are not different from a servant meaning that God has got some work to do on us and in that work the closer your relationship with God he says is the greater the inheritances so we are given the message of the we are given the word without limitation but the way we use that message would determine the level of inheritance that we enjoy as children of God you think like a child will always affect your fellowship with God we've been given the message dig into the message renew your mind think mat like the Ephesian church amen devel mind that God will anoint to make a man out of you amen have an image have a picture of what you want God to make you amen I was just imagining the gross of brother Bram as is seen in the changing of his mind thinking different like 1963 the opening of the seals then brother Bram calling it a new ministry he says the Bible became a new book he was lifting him up with a totally different Ministry not operating by a gift but he had to wait for the word himself to do a work in his people he revealed to him what God had always wanted him to break in the creative anointing amen so he came to the understanding open up your mind amen think like a mature person the more relationship you have with God is the greater the impact it will produce in your relationship with God Amen and you know you you you you need to know who you are you need to know what you are you need to know what your position is because the brother says we fall every day how will you know when you don't know what you are supposed to be when you are standing what will you stand back to amen he says when Satan fell he had no restoration point because he was created from nothing but you and me we came from the word when we fall we have a feeling of the word calling us back the Ephesian Church they knew where they fell from God will tell them go back to the restoration point when Israel was in Egypt they knew where they fell from they had to go back to Canaan when they Israel fell and went to babon they knew where to go back amen as a child of God you must know your standing in the world that when you fall you know where you fell from and you know where to be restored amen You Know Who You Are as a seed chin of God what you are your position in the body your rights as a child of God are you together with me yeah God loves us and he to send us this GI and we appreciate them amen amen the impact of the restoration what has it done and what does it want to do great things that the brothers brought you see Satan had no clim because where did he fall from nothing where would he want to go back to nothing so you must know yourself as a child of God you have told the devil I'm not like you I'm a Child of God to fall I may fall but I have a restoration point isn't that wonderful how many children of God are here God bless you God's children you know where you came from from amen if you fall to the first if you fallen on the Rocks the brother says don't sit on the ground immediately come up that's a mature child of God God bless you brother mes amen amen isn't that wonderful you know those nuggets they make us and those nuggets they encourage us those nuggets they gave us a vision of where we are headed to The Whispers of Satan cannot beat those truths amen so you are a child of God you know your restoration Point these people like Henry in the computers they talk about a restoration point is supposed to be here and if anything goes wrong they Resto at that point children of God will know where they F and God will be obligated to restore them amen I'm seeing that it man say you understand what it is amen God bless you amen yeah
