[34:10] [Music]
[34:38] [Applause]
[34:45] and we know that we are of god
[34:49] but the word lies in wickedness
[34:52] so there is a dividing line
[34:56] that's what i believe and you should not
[34:59] allow the
[35:11] comes with a self-identification we
[35:13] don't know
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:21] and the moment you say we are of god
[35:23] they don't come into the background
[35:25] then you begin to question what
[35:26] handicapped what am i
[35:28] going to do there already
[35:31] i'm of god you are catholic the world
[35:34] lies in sin yes
[35:36] why should i go do this right now move
[35:39] this coming
[35:42] i am of god then you are exponential you
[35:44] are telling your body only
[35:47] that i am of god in zendo

[35:52] want to control this body have you
[35:54] enough confident

[36:04] when you get baptized of the holy ghost
[36:08] [Applause]
[36:10] then the
[36:16] [Applause]
[36:26] [Music]

[36:54] amen so that you can be seen develop
[36:57] yourself
[36:57] whenever that word of god
[37:08] god chooses certain men
[37:11] to bring to us
[37:13] [Music]
[37:16] to show how the overcomer lives his life
[37:29] [Applause]
[37:40] [Music]

[37:58] [Applause]
[37:59] [Music]
[38:06] [Applause]
[38:11] [Music]
[38:15] and see what god wants you to be what
[38:17] would that generate
[38:19] men that were worse controlled by your
[38:21] fallen nature
[38:24] but they rose and
[38:28] you know kind of a bridge background
[38:43] where you overcome the flesh
[38:48] that's what it is negativity because
[38:51] that eternal seed one gets scared
[38:54] they'll never be destroyed
[38:58] how can god take that eternal nature
[39:03] into hell yeah it can't happen
[39:07] so this means that anybody was an
[39:11] eternal seed in here
[39:26] faith some people get so proud
[39:31] because their lives are fine
[39:35] not trial against no problem
[39:39] no trouble

[46:18] shall we not much more rather being
[46:20] subjection and the father of spirits
