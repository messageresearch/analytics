========================================

[Music] [Applause] oh amen praise the name of our Lord I GRE you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a w evening but we thank God let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for yet another opportunity Lord that you've given unto us to come into your presence you said where two three are gaed in your name you will be there in their mid and Lord we believe you here in our midst so we call upon the name of the Lord may you speak to us in such special father you know what we have need of Lord may you come Lord in all our areas that Lord you may give us courage Lord and strengthen us father even for the journey that still lays before us Lord we want to thank for all that you have done and we still look at you father for even our expectations to be fulfilled we love you and we bless you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus this amen let us go to First chonicles 1 chonicles chapter 29 chapter 29 we're reading from verse 9 to verse 18 the Bible says then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and David the king also rejoiced with great joy wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that in the heaven and and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord and thou art exalted head above [Music] all now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but whom am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this s for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee verse [Music] 14 for we are stranger us before thee and sojourn us as were all our fathers our days on Earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding oh Lord Our God all this to that we have prepared to build the and house for thy Holy Name cometh of thine hand and is all thine own I know also my God that though triest heart and as pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart have I willingly offered all these things and now have I seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee Oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee is amen you may be seated I just want to take our text from verse 15 which says for we are strangers before the and soin us as were all our fathers our days on Earth as a shadow and there is none abiding so I want to talk about the passing shadow praise the name of our Lord the passing Shadow and that's what the Bible is telling us that we are a passing Shadow when you try to follow backwards or when you want to know what happened then you start wondering is it true or it's not true because it's noral like the historians you know they talk about Napoleon Bon Alexander the Great if these things were not written we wouldn't know anything that those things but then when you read about nebar and then how the Bible says was a king of kings was such a great man and all those kind of things but now when you go to follow what he did or you to find out where was that you find that the place where babyon was is disolated you know there's nothing you can TR and then even the life he live or whatever things did you look at the Great temple that Solomon built So Glorious with a lot of gold and silver and everything and then he built this Temple for the Lord but then you see that the glory of that Temple even Solomon himself in his time he was such a wise man but now when you try to follow Solomon where do you find him there's no more the temple he built there the great many things he did maybe his Palace maybe the streets of gold they're not there they are all a passing Shadow and so we see that even our life here on Earth is a passing shadow it doesn't matter our achievement our recognition the awards that we can get the education which we can attain the fame you know maybe the riches we have or the wealth we have the knowledge we have the wisdom we have our good health and then maybe they said this one is the most healthy person in the world maybe the hor most honorable person oh glorious person oh power might strength there is a friend I had sometime when I was still working in to and for him he said he had never fallen sick very healthy man but it only took some small kind of sickness he was hospitalized and within one week the man died and I remember I went to the hospital to visit him said I've never fallen sick and he looked strong but he's in the hospital after some few days we that the man has died all these things are a passing sh so regardless of our achievements that we get they all vanish away it's like chasing wi so we see that a natural man is a passing Shadow passing through the Earth even whatever we do is All Temporary praise the name of our Lord It's All Temporary like now you look at that building I think it's around CH Road around the lake Victoria Hotel which hosted the queen when she was still when she was still I think a princess when you go to the place right now it's not attractive at all but yet was glorious in the 1950s very great place but now when you go to the place you find rats asleeping there maybe snakes are there different things it's not attractive it's not attractive passing Shadow and then you look at now the great queen of Britain you know the name she had the glory she had the Majesty you know the the things when you would get into her presence but she's no more so we see that all our life here on Earth the Bible says is like a shadow our days on Earth are as a shadow and the Bible says there is none abiding it doesn't regardless of how much you may try to say oh let me be careful let me do this there is a time that it will come to pass that you are noral whether it is great honor or great digity praise the name of our Lord it all passes away it all comes to an end it doesn't matter the status of a person it doesn't matter the possessions of a person it doesn't matter the achievements of a person they all pass away it's just a passing Shadow and that's why the Bible is telling us praise the name of our Lord that's why the Bible tells us we need to learn praise the name of our Lord to number our days can be honored by the Lord praise the name of our Lord now in Psalms 90 ver9 the scripture says for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told just as a tale it just becomes a story maybe somebody looks at some kind of stone somewhere when he goes there it's a tombstone and then he reads so and so born this died this then maybe they can put the recognition maybe the best maybe they did this it's it's just a story no more there that's what the Bible is telling us all our years you know they are just like a tale that is told just tell in other words somebody may not take much interest in it why do you tell me about that what concern it's no more praise the name of our Lord so now but one thing that the Lord wants us to do is that when we are put here on Earth we shouldn't look at the things of this world much as we are going through this world and this world and everything vanishes away but during this time God is establishing his kingdom and it is very very important for us that we are part of the Kingdom the kingdom of God that shall live forever and that should be the main thing here on us that while we are passing on Earth as a shadow but one thing we have to be certain we are part of the Kingdom that being establish praise the name of our Lord we are part of that Eternal Kingdom that is being established because the Bible says all the kingdoms of this world are going to perish they are going to vanish it doesn't matter how strong the kingdom is it doesn't matter how powerful the kingdom is it doesn't matter how recognized the kingdom is all they are going to pass away like right now when we look at the kingdoms of the when we look at America every country wants be like United States ofer so powerful in everything powerful in ammunition they are powerful in technology they have the richest people in the world they have the best infrastructure in the world everything is almost the best everything is the best there powerful Kingdom but according to the prophet of our day America is going to be burned and it will be the end of that Kingdom you know brother Bram in 1933 all the land of America just burning de everything to ashes the people there the infrastructure there the technology there of them burning to praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says there is no continuing City here on Earth but we are seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God we are seeking a continuing City whose foundations are built by God we are seeking for that city that is built on righteousness that built on a purpose of living eternally not the cities of this world because the more the city of this world develop the more wicked they become praise the name of the more evil they become the more immoral they become praise the name of our Lord like now you see a place is having good neighborhood but then when they put there a bar then you see all forms of immorality there prostitutions there drunkness there King one another there completely set up change praise the name of our Lord like now when you move like on this road going to cam there's a place there around Randa they put there something like either or what and then I remember when we were having the overnight last week and then moving along there on Good Friday got there a lot of wickedness but the neighborhood was before better than what it is now and then there's also another place as you are turning getting to Tak and then also that place but those places were better than that but they put buildings and then they use those buildings for immoral and it brings destruction at the end of the day praise the name of our Lord now in the Book of Daniel Daniel chapter [Music] 2 and then verse 44 he says and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to the other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever for as much as th the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and interpretation thereof praise the name of the Lord so he says all these kingdoms are all going to be destroyed praise the name of our when the Lord Jesus comes the third time in Revelations chapter 19 that's when he takes over all the Earth you know and everything Kingdom of us will be destroyed and then Christ will become the King of Kings to get into the millennial R praise the name of our Lord so now the Bible is telling us that in the days of these kingdoms of this world even now Christ is establishing his kingdom and is's establishing it under righteousness so much as we are living in these bodies much as we are living in the passing Shadow out of Us Praise the name of our Lord God is establishing an eternal praise the name of our Lord and that should always encourage us every other day seeking the kingdom of God seeking the righteousness of God everything that we do like now when we can go back and maybe we are going to follow up you know maybe the days of Adam the days of you know no and all those people through you may not find whatever thing they did on Earth you may not find what they did here on us but now for them when they were here on us they became a cloud of witnesses people who lived by the grace of God being obedient to the word of God should also be our desire to be part of the cloud of witnesses part of the kingdom of God part of the redeemed of the Lord that regardless of the days they were living in they were also evil they were having challenges in their times yet they overcame in their even us now in the midst of all the wickedness we see in the midst of all the evil that we see we need to live upright and overcome also in our generation praise the name of our Lord because it is at this time that God is making a bride for Jesus Christ it is at this time that God wants to get a Perfect Bride a church without Sports a church without wrinkles a church without any blemish praise the name of our Lord and God has given us the blood of Jesus Christ by which we can overcome every kind of praise the name of our Lord we have the blood the cloud of witnesses in Hebrews chapter 11 they had the blood of animals so we have a greater witness than those people in the Old Testament depending upon themselves but then here we are depending upon God to give us the grace to overcome every day that we live praise the name of our Lord we have a great cloud of witness praise the name of our so as we are going through this passing Shadow praise the name of our Lord when we go to Hebrews 12 and then verse one Hebrews 12 and then verse one he says wherefor seeing also we are compassed about with great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does easily beset us and run with patience the race that is set before us praise the name of the Lord so he says let us run with patience the rest that is set before us so the rest is what is what is the passing Shadow so while the others there it is a l to them for us there is a purpose God has created us to come in our generation and run our race praise the name of our Lord to us it is not a loss people without Christ it is a loss praise the name of our Lord because they come to Earth for a short time and then from Earth to destruction praise the name of our Lord but then we come on us we are manifested we are tempted that we be able to possess the kingdom praise the name of our Lord so he says it is a rest praise the name of our Lord and Paul when he had run his rest he said I have finished my course praise the name of our Lord my set time has already been done and said I'm now ready to be offered up he scared he saw that he had done the purpose of God he was depending upon the leadership of the God every other day and that should also be the same thing with our lives every day that you raise up ask the Lord lead me through this day guide me through this day help me to know what you want me to do today that should be the way we pass through our lives every other day seeking the Lord serving the lord woring the Lord and doing the things that are Pleasant unto the Lord so he says when we are in distress let us run with patience and then we should look unto Jesus the and finish of our fa praise the name of just have a focus wherever you go whatever you do look on to Jesus and then you depend upon God and then the Lord will help you to run your race then at the end of the race you can say I've done the best I can for the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then the Lord will say Well done though my good and faithful Ser praise the name of our Lord you've done what the Lord desired you know you've done what the Lord has sent you to do and so we should always be Desiring do the will of God in our lives praise the name of our look at the story where we have R David when he had come to the end of his life and then he had the Zeal to build the house of the Lord and then the Lord said no but then Lord revealed to him the pattern of the house and so they were able to know what is needed so he labored and encouraged the people to give in and then they were giving all their possession gold they are silver every precious thing that they had and then they put them in the store it was exceedingly abundant and then David called for a Thanksgiving Day and then he started praising the Lord and said oh God who are we praise the name of our recognizing that he has done what is pleasing unto the Lord and the people have offered freely to the Lord and that's the same thing we should do also to freely offer our lives unto the Lord all your life all your life without your reservation your body you have given it to the Lord your human Spirit you've given it to the Lord your soul you've given it to the Lord your time you're giving it to the Lord your resources you're giving it to the Lord and so they offered themselves freely unto the Lord willingly with a perfect heart and they offered them to the Lord and David rejoiced with such great Jo and that should be our daily living Lord here I Amad Me Guide Me Lord praise the name of the Lord that's how we need to pass through our time to know that the whole of last week God gave me the grace I was able to do what he wanted to do this week I'm going to do the same thing so that makes you ready it makes you ready for the Rapture you're not saying oh God first wait make this right you are certain every day you leave you are ready to be taken the of Our Lord you are ready like Paul saying now I'm ready to be offered but for us we are not preparing to be offered but we are being prepared to be changed in our bodies praise the name of our Lord in a trinkling of night that our M bodies put imortality because that's the promise we have today the promise is the change of our bodies the promise is the adoption of our bodies where our motal bodies will become imortal that's the promise of the day that we have the rupture praise the name of our Lord this is the thing that is before us this is the crown that is set before us that is the mark of the High Calling that is our Target that is the the climax praise the name of our Lord that is it so every day you live I'm ready Lord for the change of my body praise the name of our Lord so David recognized that everything that he had the richest that he had the honor that he had he said they come from the Lord and then he gave that back to the Lord praise the name of our Lord and now we need to recognize also the same that we are not of our own praise the name of our Lord we are of the lordes and we need to depend upon the Lord in everything that we do and if the Lord desired something out from you don't be mean and say no this one I'm not giving just really say Lord It's Your I give it back to you praise the name of our Lord that's what David was doing and all the children of Israel praise the name of our Lord our days here on Earth the Bible says we are strangers and we are soour we just passed through just a short time and it's noal praise the name of our time it's no more sometimes you can be bed let me prepare for my children this but when you pass away they dispose them of even your grave is sold off they have no value for it everything say but me I don't want to live in that place I want to live in the other place for you what you had that's up to you tell it's just like a thought it has gone away praise the name of our Lord but in the days that the Lord has given unto us let us learn to live for him praise the name of our Lord let us go to Jeremiah 9 and then verse 23 Jemiah 9 ver 23 the Bible says thus says the Lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches praise the name he says don't Glory when you have wisdom don't Glory because you have might and don't because you have riches and you know the days people strive to acquire this somebody will try to do a lot of exercises body praise the name of Lord another will try to do the best he can to conquer the rest to be powerful or work very hard and become too rich or read a lot until you get a lot of wisdom and knowledge and now the Lord is telling us don't glory in these things why it's a passing shadow they vanish away praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says that God knows how to turn the wisdom of the wise into foolishness praise the name of our Lord that God can do it he knows how to turn the riches into nothing vanish he knows how to turn the powerful to a prisoner he does it then he says then the princess are just down rulers know how to do that so he says you don't have to glory in those kind of but what should you glory in in verse 24 but let him that glories glory in this that he understand and knows me that I am the Lord which exercises loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the eyes for in these things do I Delight says the Lord praise the name so then that should be the timate the desire do you know God praise the name of our Lord have you received salvation has have you been changed do you have the mind of God are you moving by the will of God you doing things that are pleasing to the Lord And now when you are doing that and then you have all these other things you not going to be troubled praise the name of our but when you have them and they are more important to you your wisdom is more important to you than God knowledge is more important to you than God riches are more important to you than God your might is all power all H is more important you than God it is a passing Shadow vanity praise the name of our Lord and the Bible says it is the chasing of wind praise the name of our Lord so we need to see that the time that God has given us here on Earth we use it for his service we use it to live for his kingdom we use it to seek his face and say Lord here I am praise the name of our what will you have me to do praise the name of our Lord let us go to Psalms 49 the wise men die likewise the fool and the British people person perish and leave their wealth to others their inward thought is that their houses shall continue forever and they ding places to all generations they call their lands after their own names nevertheless man being in honor abideth not he is like the beasts that perish this there way is their fly yet their posterity approve their sayings like ship they are laid in the grave Death Shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dring but will redeem my soul from the power of the Grave for he shall receive me now be not though afraid when one is made Rich when the glory of his house is increased for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says they perish even what they have done is Left Behind and it also perishes praise the name of our Lord but it says but the upright they shall dominion over them in the morning the Bible says that the meek shall inherit the earth praise the name of our so now while we are living on Earth in this season of passing Shadow we need to be certain that we are part of the kingdom of God a kingdom that's being established Kingdom that lives forever and ever praise the name of our Lord because that's the kingdom that will live here on Earth eternally praise the name of our Lord and so God showed Daniel when Daniel saw how these kingdoms come and Conquer one another they use deception they use you know kind of old funny things to conquer from one to the other we see the current state of the world in some other countries they use dictators in some other countries they use monarchies you know like the Kings and so on some other countries you know it it is just taking over then some other countries whatever systems that they are all over the world it's all going to come to pass away praise the name of our Lord but during this time God is establishing his God is getting his people God is getting people into the kingdom being born again in the kingdom and that's our desire to be born into the kingdom of God a kingdom that is forever a kingdom that shall not perish a kingdom that is eternal all other kingdoms will vanish all these other systems of the world will vanish away but the kingdom of God will never be moved praise the name of our Lord and that should be our desire every other day to live in that Kingdom to seek that Kingdom to know the will of God prise the name of our the Lord Tau us in our Lord's prayer that let your will be done on Earth as it is done in heaven let your kingdom come in other words be a subject to the kingdom of God prise the name of our Lord because it's an everlasting King it is an eternal Kingdom and then the spirit says the kingdom of God is within you says it is the Holy Ghost so then you have the Holy Ghost In You you have the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost to be in you that's the kingdom of God and then the Holy Ghost will direct you the Holy Ghost will reveal to you the will of God every other day that you live you know you are living by the grace of God it's the will of God working in your life praise the name of our Lord you cannot enjoy the benefits of the king without having the power of the kingdom and that's the ghost working in our lives the Holy Ghost will give you the victory over all your weaknesses the Holy Ghost will give you the victory over all things the devil is trying to put around you and then you be able that you live above thetion you live above the issues that are happening now in the world you live above politics you live about economics you live above health issues the spirit of God working in you Mak you to live Above This praise the name of our is that even when you are sick you are hopeful praise the name of our Lord like job he said even in this body the skin worms eat up this body in my body will I see my Lord the name of our Lord for so much in such great hope praise the name of our Lord and he was not scared by what he was going through but you know he had a constant fellowship with God and that should be the same thing with us praise the name of our Lord living in the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord let us go to Daniel chapter 7 and then Verse 18 the Bible says but the sa of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever praise the name of the Lord you know Daniel when you read the book of Daniel you will see how the kingdoms of this world they take over from one another this one comes with reception this one uses INRI this one uses this and when Daniel was seeing all these things it terrified him but the Lord showed him that the sense of the most high shall take over the kingdom that Kingdom shall be forever and ever and ever and it will not be conquered by another praise the name of our Lord what a great assurance that we have that right now we in the kingdom of God that is now spiritual but that Kingdom will become physical here on us praise the name of our Lord when the Lord Jesus comes to re over the whole Earth in verse 22 it says until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom praise the name of our Lord taking full possessions over the whole earth praise the name of our Lord the Earth without sin the Earth without death the Earth without anything evil that is our possession praise the name of our Lord in verse 27 and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be given to the the people of the Saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions Shall Serve and praise the name of our Lord what an assurance that we have praise the name of our Lord that much as we are in a passing Shadow but at this present time God is establishing his eternal by the New Birth by the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord now in the message Christ is the mystery of God re he says notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original restoring back his bride in Fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden Christ and his bride and God that day say the kingdom shall be given over to the father and he might be all in all while he yet speaking I will hear David Christ David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race and while they were yet thinking I will know what they are thinking about before they speak I will answer them the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat stra like the Bullock and they shall fed together let down they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain and you know when you read in the scriptures the Holy Mountain represents the kingdom praise the name of our Lord the kingdom of the Lord is referred to as a mountain then he says right exactly to Eden again as as as it can go then he says there is his threefold purpose God help us to know it help us to know it listen closely now as we go on going back to the original Eden then when we are born of him we are filled with him see your life his life in in you then all actions should declare him like taking life out of one tree and putting it in another take a life out of a pure tree and then you put it in an app tree it will be it is going to cause the all right then all our actions should declare him we have his name is that right we should bear his name praise the name of our Lord and remember we are as his bride pred with his spirit the church bearing children pred by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the pinenes evidence of his resurrection showing that he's not dead that is aive Forever This is eternal life and Vindicated it vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you are a church member because Christ is living through you so PRN with this spirit that you are a prisoner to anything you are confined to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth praise the name of that's what should be our desire every as we pass through this life praise the name of our Lord all the things we do naturally passing Shadow praise the name of our Lord but yet we need to see that in our days here on Earth we are part of the kingdom of God because that's what will not pass away being born into that Kingdom the Bible says that's the kingdom that will be Everlasting and God has given us an opportunity that while we are still living here on Earth we can be part of that King that does not pass away praise the name of our Lord what a privilege praise the name of our Lord that can be part of the kingdom of God it doesn't matter what you're going through praise the name of our we have the blood of Jesus that washes us from all unrighteous praise the name of our Lord and you just keep yourself clean in the blood of Jesus being obedient the word of God if you do something wrong Lord forgive and then continue on don't dwell on your failures don't dwell on your sins or your mistakes look at that look to calary praise the name of Lord you falter the blood is there Lord reach out to me raise me out of this weakness raise me out of this failure and then you continue going praise the name of Lord don't get yourself into self condemnation praise the name of the Lord don't get yourself into that kind of situation there is a sister I was told that she doesn't want to come to church when they ask her why don't you want to come to church she says I feel dirty I feel so much of a sinner but if you are sick and you know there is a hospital why don't you go to the hospital and the Bible says is the sick that need the physician and the church is for sick people the church is for Sinners to come and be changed into the sense of the you don't allow the devil to put that in your mind that I've sined until I can't be wored you just come there is enough blood of Jesus Christ to our praise the name of our Lord don't allow the devil to bind you out but just say Lord I'm running back to you Lord I'm coming back to you Lord I need Deliverance Lord I need healing the door is still open as long as you are still alive that means there's still Grace to help praise the name of our Lord so don't allow that kind of thing to happen to you if you fall the Bible says a righteous person falls seven times day but what makes him righteous is when he falls he doesn't remain down praise the name of our why there's the blood of Jesus Christ you just come and reach out and say Lord have mer like the prodal son he went and wasted everything of his father half of his father's living he went into a far country but when he was in the far country it came to his heart let me go back to my father and when the father saw him far away the father didn't condemn him the father didn't say don't come back but the Bible says the father R to him and so this my son was lost but now he found was dead but now he alive and that's the same thing with our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says when a Shepherd is having 100 sheep and then one gets lost does the and look for the one that's our Lord Jesus Christ is interested that every member of the body is in this position and so you have to believe I'm part of the body of Jesus the Rapture cannot take place without me praise the name of you need to believe that praise the name of I said Lord I'm here I need to be delivered I need to help praise the name of our Lord while we are passing through this Shadow the Lord is establishing his kingdom praise the name of our Lord and we have been called to be part of the praise the name of our Lord and you take it by faith that I'm part of the Kingdom I'm a Child of God I have been redeemed I've been set free praise the
