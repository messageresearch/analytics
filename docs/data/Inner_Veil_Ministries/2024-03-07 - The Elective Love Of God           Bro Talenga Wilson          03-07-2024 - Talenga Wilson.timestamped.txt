[20:55] 7 amen
[21:00] let's start from verse 6 to
[21:05] 7 amen
[21:16] amen for thou art Unholy people unto the
[21:20] Lord thy God the Lord thy God has chosen
[21:23] thee to be a special people unto himself
[21:26] above all people that are upon the face
[21:29] of
[21:42] the Lord did not see did not set his
[21:45] love upon you nor choose you because you
[21:48] were more in number than any people for
[21:50] you were the fewest of all people
[22:05] because the Lord loved you and because
[22:09] he would keep the oath which he had
[22:12] shown unto your fathers has the Lord
[22:14] brought you out with a mighty hand and
[22:17] redeemed you out of the house of born
[22:20] men from the hand of pharaoh king of
[22:22] Egypt
[22:37] [Music]
[22:42] [Music]
[22:50] amen we may get
[22:51] seated amen amen so we are picking up
[22:55] from our context of last Wednesday
[23:00] we saw praise the Lord where we looked
[23:04] at the a New
[23:07] Covenant and a
[23:10] better praise the Lord where we saw how
[23:14] God that made a covenant with
[23:17] Abraham and how God is faithful to keep
[23:20] his
[23:21] Covenant that he makes with his
[23:24] children praise the lord we saw how the
[23:27] children of
[23:29] Jacob and the generations
[23:32] theref how they fall favor before the
[23:35] sight of the
[23:37] Lord not because they were
[23:40] worthy but because God had established a
[23:43] covenant with their
[23:46] fathers and we saw how God worked
[23:49] Faithfully with the
[23:52] people praise the Lord and how he
[23:55] promised them a
[23:56] land that he had promised
[23:59] to his
[24:00] servant Abraham and how he promised that
[24:05] land and how that Generations there
[24:08] after come and that
[24:11] land and we saw how God does
[24:15] m allowed
[24:18] 4 years
[24:22] afterwards and after that God still
[24:24] visited his
[24:27] word to come and fulfill his
[24:29] promise that made with Abraham and we
[24:33] saw that he's the same yesterday to done
[24:37] forever and we saw that in this
[24:40] generation in the New
[24:42] Testament praise the Lord he gave us
[24:45] another better test another better
[24:49] Covenant by the blood of Jesus
[24:52] Christ a covenant and two
[24:55] children a covenant to be called
[24:57] children of God
[24:59] a where he chooses
[25:02] us and brings us to
[25:04] himself then he tells us he's going up
[25:07] to prepare place for
[25:09] us and how that he would come back to
[25:13] take us to
[25:15] himself in the rupture and how we see
[25:18] that if God was faithful in the Old
[25:22] Testament and after all those many
[25:25] years he still kept the Covenant that he
[25:28] made with
[25:30] abrah and how we are confident that the
[25:32] same
[25:34] God who never changes will still visit
[25:37] us our
[25:39] day with this new and better
[25:42] Covenant praise the Lord and we are
[25:45] hopeful that one day it shall come to
[25:49] pass that the bride shall not be praise
[25:52] the Lord but that Christ will come and
[25:54] take the
[25:56] himself why because it is a promise that
[25:58] he
[26:00] gave his promises never
[26:03] fail praise the Lord and out of the same
[26:06] context
[26:07] tonight I want us to take a ride in the
[26:09] elective love of
[26:14] God the elective love of
[26:18] God praise the Lord so now as we read
[26:21] from the book of Genesis last
[26:24] week how God had visited Abraham
[26:29] remember AB Wasing the
[26:33] moon AB Wasing Idols because he was in a
[26:38] nation in a land that knew not
[26:41] God but how God chose
[26:45] AB not because abrah was the best of all
[26:48] the people that living the of the
[26:51] Earth but God chose
[26:53] Abraham because he loved him praise the
[26:57] Lord abrah
[26:59] did not have the best
[27:01] character God chose
[27:03] Abraham he loved him praise lot and now
[27:07] here when God was speaking the children
[27:09] of
[27:11] Israel reminding them of his elective
[27:15] love reminding them of how he chose
[27:19] ABR and how Abraham had not done
[27:22] anything good before the sight of the
[27:25] Lord but God had chosen him by
[27:29] himself so now here God reminds his
[27:32] people and says in
[27:35] verse for thou Unholy
[27:39] people unto th
[27:41] God why because he has chosen you to
[27:45] himself and he says the Lord thy God has
[27:48] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[27:56] himself all that upon the face of the
[28:01] Earth praise the Lord he says he has
[28:04] chosen thee he has chosen you to be a
[28:09] special
[28:12] people and the New Testament calls
[28:16] it
[28:18] people special
[28:21] people who have been
[28:23] called Praise the Lord so now here God
[28:26] calls them as special people
[28:29] and says the Lord did not set his love
[28:32] upon
[28:34] you nor choose you because you were more
[28:40] in number than any
[28:43] people so here this
[28:46] scripture praise the Lord it sets out a
[28:50] president that God did not choose
[28:54] us not choose to love us
[28:58] because we had special conditions that
[29:01] we
[29:04] fulfilled how we saw last
[29:07] week that the love of God is
[29:10] unconditional and this election is
[29:14] unconditional that's why when he went to
[29:16] choose
[29:18] Abraham he didn't set out conditions for
[29:21] Abram praise the Lord and when he made
[29:24] Covenant with
[29:25] abrah he still never set up conditions
[29:28] with
[29:30] ABR all he required of
[29:33] Abraham was
[29:35] obedience praise the Lord and when
[29:37] Abraham accepted the voice of
[29:40] God and he obeyed the voice of the
[29:43] Lord and he left his
[29:46] country and he left his
[29:49] household and he moved to a place that
[29:51] God had
[29:53] chose now it was now in the hands of God
[29:58] of
[29:59] Abram that's why God set out a
[30:02] covenant and said by this I shall be
[30:04] reminded of your
[30:07] obedience praise the Lord and in the
[30:10] same
[30:11] manner God has set out a
[30:13] covenant because when he loved us he has
[30:17] loved so many people and he has called
[30:20] so many people not everyone has obeyed
[30:23] the voice of the
[30:25] Lord in this day so now because he has
[30:28] loved us still gave us a same
[30:32] promise a same
[30:34] Covenant those that have that have
[30:37] accepted the
[30:39] voice when I called out when I was
[30:43] choosing those that accepted the voice
[30:46] of the
[30:48] messenger and obey the voice of the
[30:51] messenger I have a special place set for
[30:55] them that's why he said I go prepare a
[30:58] place for
[31:00] you you who he has
[31:02] called Praise the Lord who he has set
[31:05] before the
[31:06] table those that are feeding daily
[31:09] before the
[31:10] table he said I have not called you to
[31:13] leave you on the
[31:14] table but behold I go up to prepare a
[31:18] place for you praise the Living God and
[31:21] he said but
[31:23] remember I have chosen you because I
[31:27] loved you
[31:28] not because you had any special
[31:31] attributes not because you are so many
[31:33] in
[31:34] number not because you are
[31:37] rich not because you of a special
[31:40] character but simply because I loved
[31:43] you and because the Lord loved
[31:47] you and because he would keep the O
[31:50] which had shown with his with your
[31:54] fathers now who are our fathers
[31:58] B says we are Abraham's
[32:00] seed and we become Abraham's
[32:04] seed by
[32:05] obedience praise the lord we become
[32:08] Abraham SE by obedience to the word of
[32:12] God pra the Lord because when we
[32:15] obey God gives us his life the messeng
[32:20] teaches us that total obedience to the
[32:23] word of God
[32:28] praise the Lord to the baptism of the
[32:30] holy spirit so now when we obey the
[32:33] voice of God to OB the voice of the
[32:38] messenger praise the Lord and you
[32:41] accepted and when you heard the voice
[32:44] you accepted and when you accepted you
[32:48] obey the voice and you started moving in
[32:51] the direction of that
[32:54] voice and we left the comfort
[32:58] the
[33:00] comfort and we chose the way of the
[33:03] Lord prise the Lord and the way of the
[33:07] Lord is not
[33:10] smooth but it is
[33:13] rugged because we
[33:15] accepted to be loved by our loved
[33:18] ones we accepted to be
[33:21] rejected to be called all sorts of
[33:25] names for the word's sake
[33:28] because we we obey that
[33:31] voice we rejected of our
[33:33] families for the sake of the word god
[33:37] establishes a covenant with
[33:40] us and the Covenant is the Covenant of
[33:42] eternal
[33:43] life when Abraham
[33:46] accepted to be rejected of the family
[33:49] because he chose to worship and only
[33:51] serve the true Living
[33:54] God praise the Lord he was rejected
[33:58] because he left his family and he never
[34:01] turned back and because of his
[34:04] commitment to the
[34:05] [Applause]
[34:06] words God accepted him because of our
[34:10] toward the
[34:12] word because of youred towards the
[34:15] word god accepted us and he loved us and
[34:20] he chose us and he showed us his word so
[34:23] when you go by the way of his
[34:25] word it is upon
[34:28] is his duty praise the Lord to one fill
[34:33] with the Holy
[34:34] Spirit why because the Holy Spirit which
[34:38] is the life of God must eliminate our
[34:42] paths it must shine through our
[34:45] paths which is the light and
[34:51] darkness praise the Living God so now we
[34:54] become Abraham's SE
[34:57] after we have obeyed the voice of God
[35:00] and when he gives us his
[35:02] life this life prepares us for the
[35:06] eternal life why because the life that
[35:09] he gives us is the life of God which is
[35:14] eternal but now when abrah was
[35:17] moving along the way praise the Lord
[35:21] because his
[35:22] body was not yet
[35:25] glorified Abraham also went through
[35:28] certain challenges in
[35:31] life he was tested but through it all he
[35:37] held first the Le of the Holy
[35:40] Spirit praise the Lord he always
[35:42] remember the Covenant of
[35:45] God because in the Covenant God promised
[35:49] abrah that I will give you a
[35:53] son shall be here your inheritance
[35:58] and each time Abram was
[36:00] moving when he
[36:02] fed remember the Covenant that God had
[36:05] made with
[36:07] him and he held back to that
[36:10] promise 25 years
[36:12] later had grown old but because he had
[36:17] hope and his hope never ran
[36:21] out God visited him Accord to the time
[36:25] of life and got a
[36:29] son faithful to the word of God so when
[36:32] we are faithful to he who called
[36:36] us he establishes our
[36:39] Fai he provides for the way praise the
[36:43] Lord he gives us
[36:45] strength when we are becoming
[36:47] weak praise the Lord he gives us words
[36:50] of
[36:51] Courage when becoming
[36:53] wary because he knows that the journey
[36:56] is not easy
[36:59] but praise the Lord he is bound and he
[37:03] provides sufficient
[37:05] Grace praise the Lord Abraham never
[37:08] fell he remained faithful though at some
[37:12] point as a
[37:14] man praise the Lord when the people were
[37:16] laughing at him when people were
[37:19] rejecting him because he held to the
[37:23] promise praise the Lord until even Sarah
[37:27] thought maybe the promise was not going
[37:30] to come through
[37:32] Abraham and he compelled
[37:34] ha praise the Lord and He compelled
[37:38] Abraham to go in for he so they could
[37:42] bear a child praise the Lord even when
[37:46] Abraham had produced
[37:49] is is was not according to the order of
[37:53] God and God still reminded ABR
[37:58] that your SE must come from
[38:01] Sarah and even when Sarah was becoming
[38:04] very
[38:05] old God Contin reminding
[38:08] Abraham be patient with me praise the
[38:12] Lord and he walked one year he W two
[38:15] years he walked three years he walked 10
[38:19] years and he was still faithful in his
[38:23] work 20 years and he was still hoping
[38:26] upon the Lord
[38:28] and 25 years the Lord visited him praise
[38:32] the Lord and the Lord established him
[38:35] but we see that even after God had
[38:37] provided Abraham with a
[38:41] child exposed him to another
[38:44] trial and remember the Bible says the
[38:48] trying of our
[38:50] face sou
[38:52] patience it works sou patience so when
[38:56] Abraham was being Tri
[38:59] was working out patience for him and he
[39:02] became patient with
[39:04] God and wherever God L him Abraham
[39:09] went to the extent that even after
[39:12] looking at his
[39:14] son praise the Lord even when God came
[39:17] down and told
[39:19] him this only son that I have given unto
[39:22] you I want him for a
[39:25] sacrifice because Abraham learn
[39:28] patience praise the Lord he still became
[39:31] patient with
[39:33] God and He waited upon the Lord and says
[39:37] the one that you've given me I will
[39:39] offer him unto you and he him up and he
[39:43] was obedient to the voice and because he
[39:46] was
[39:47] obedient God provided a
[39:50] sacrifice God provided a sacrifice for
[39:54] Abraham and now when Abraham was done
[39:56] being
[39:59] God looked at him and he sealed him
[40:03] praise the Lord God sealed him that's
[40:06] why Abraham holds a special position
[40:09] before
[40:11] God all the C of
[40:14] Abraham all the SS of
[40:17] Abraham have a special place before God
[40:21] he has said to the children of
[40:23] Israel four generations after Abraham is
[40:26] gone
[40:28] he says I have called you Unholy people
[40:32] before me special people because I loved
[40:37] you praise the Lord because he loved us
[40:41] he has called us a special people and
[40:43] just called us to
[40:45] himself praise the Lord and He that has
[40:48] called us is not ready to lose
[40:52] us he that has called us is not ready to
[40:56] lose us
[40:58] praise the Lord because when he called
[41:00] us he called us for a
[41:02] purpose that we we made manifest his
[41:05] life in the end
[41:07] times prise the Lord that when he comes
[41:10] back he's able to find a life on
[41:14] Earth so he that called us is still very
[41:18] faithful and patient with
[41:20] us he is not going to lose us until the
[41:24] purpose which he loved and chose us
[41:28] comes to pass and that purpose is
[41:32] eternal life so until eternal
[41:35] life God is not ready to lose you the
[41:38] prophet says I heard someone saying what
[41:42] if he would backslide and
[41:46] back what if you would back slide and
[41:49] back you could do
[41:54] that you could do that well I'm lost out
[41:57] with
[41:58] god well I'm lost out with
[42:02] God lost out with
[42:06] God if you were ever found with
[42:10] him you will never be lost with
[42:13] him because God can't save you and then
[42:18] turn his back on you and Turn you and
[42:22] Turn you
[42:23] away if he
[42:25] would he defeats his on
[42:28] purpose so he can't do
[42:31] that praise the Lord if if you were ever
[42:35] found with
[42:37] him if he ever chose you to
[42:41] himself you never get lost he says he
[42:46] can't save you at the same time turn his
[42:49] back
[42:50] on that makes him get
[42:52] defeated the purpose for which he called
[42:55] us so that
[42:58] assurance that he that called us he that
[43:01] started the work in Us Faithful Is He
[43:05] that he shall dve us to the
[43:08] end praise the Lord and says because if
[43:11] Christ the same yesterday done
[43:15] forever his power is the
[43:17] same his atude is the
[43:20] same and just as he was
[43:23] then he is now and will be
[43:28] forever you just can't take nothing from
[43:32] him that's all praise the Lord and in
[43:36] another message in the church
[43:40] ages he says now the Lord God Almighty
[43:46] says I know there he is walking in the
[43:50] midst of his
[43:52] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[43:56] the flock
[43:58] but does he hold back the
[44:02] persecution does he St the
[44:05] tribulation no he does not he simply
[44:11] says I know your
[44:15] tribulation so when he called us the the
[44:19] prophet says it does not take out the
[44:21] tribulation from coming our
[44:24] way when he called Abram
[44:28] and says I shall bless you with a son he
[44:31] never took away trials out of Abraham's
[44:35] way and each time Abraham was tried and
[44:38] tested the prophet says God stands out
[44:42] and says yeah I know I know your
[44:47] tribulation I know your trying
[44:49] moments I am not all
[44:53] unmindful of your
[44:55] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[44:58] to so many people what a stumbling block
[45:01] this is to so many
[45:04] people Israel they wonder if God really
[45:07] loves
[45:09] them how can God be just and
[45:14] loving if he
[45:17] stands by if he stands by and watches
[45:20] his people
[45:23] suffer shall the service
[45:28] Israel when God had visited them and
[45:30] they were on their
[45:33] Journey they had many
[45:36] stumbl they stumbled of
[45:39] times and when they stumbled they were
[45:42] blaming God they thought God was not
[45:46] just they thought God was not
[45:49] faithful praise the Lord and they
[45:51] somehow
[45:53] thought that God had left them that he
[45:56] had turn himself away from
[45:58] them but the prophet
[46:01] says God is still mindful of for
[46:06] suffering God says I know your
[46:10] tribulation praise the Lord and now
[46:13] these on saw that God was
[46:15] watching that God stood and was simply
[46:18] watching them
[46:22] suffering and that's what they asked you
[46:25] know we were reading last week about
[46:29] KES in the Book of
[46:33] Numbers around vers
[46:37] 30 and now when they came to the chapter
[46:41] 14 the Bible says they were
[46:45] complaining and they were
[46:47] complaining until they said
[46:50] AR andto Moses they said why did God
[46:54] bring us here
[46:57] he would kill
[46:58] us together with our
[47:00] children why did God leave
[47:03] us in Egypt though we were suffering but
[47:07] we were not dying so now when they
[47:10] looked at their
[47:12] suffering that God had deserted
[47:16] them and the prophet tells us he says I
[47:20] know praise the Lord and now they even
[47:23] told
[47:24] Moses they wanted captains
[47:28] allow us to get ourselves
[47:31] Captain to take us back to where you
[47:35] face praise the Lord they had run short
[47:39] of that of that
[47:41] patience they had forgotten the
[47:44] works that God did for
[47:47] Abraham they had also forgotten the
[47:50] works that God had done for them through
[47:53] the
[47:53] Wilderness and because they were here at
[47:56] Kadesh
[47:57] and were afraid of the
[47:59] people that were in the land they were
[48:03] now complaining and telling
[48:05] Moses we know we cannot defeat them
[48:09] praise the Lord the patience that they
[48:12] had through the Red Sea they had run
[48:15] short of it they said Moses allow us to
[48:19] get ourselves
[48:21] caped you have
[48:23] failed your God has failed
[48:27] Prophet says Paul says I know I know
[48:30] your suffering so when he call us out we
[48:34] are often told we are often told that
[48:38] the Journey of the
[48:41] Israelites is a shadow of the Journey of
[48:43] the
[48:45] believer Journey it's a shadow of the
[48:49] Journey of the
[48:50] Bride
[48:52] fromon from the unbelieving
[48:55] world and now shows us that when he
[48:59] chose them and he gave them Moses to
[49:02] lead them to the promised
[49:04] land praise the Lord God never deserted
[49:09] them his presence was always with
[49:12] them through all their
[49:14] weaknesses God was still with them
[49:17] praise the Lord when they reached
[49:20] Mara and they were complaining to Moses
[49:23] they wanted water they were thirsting
[49:27] and they wanted water and now they turn
[49:30] to Moses and says give us water and
[49:33] Moses didn't have water and they began
[49:35] to complain and cry and says now why did
[49:39] you leave us
[49:40] there each time they found
[49:43] difficult they remembered where they
[49:46] came
[49:47] from but God's presence never left
[49:50] them even when they M and
[49:53] complains the presence of God still
[49:57] remained in their presence their m in
[50:00] the day he provided a
[50:03] cloud to guide them even when they were
[50:06] complaining the cloud was still there
[50:09] watching over them and directing them
[50:13] and that's how faithful our God is that
[50:16] when he called us out of Egypt when he
[50:19] called us out of Babylon when call us
[50:22] out of the unbelieving
[50:23] world out of them denominations
[50:27] God sets his eye upon us and the Bible
[50:31] says the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[50:35] righteous his eyes never deser the
[50:39] righteous why because he knows that the
[50:43] righteous have his
[50:45] righteousness and God is protective of
[50:49] his own life so he sets his
[50:52] eyes upon the righteous praise the Lord
[50:56] so many
[50:57] times sometimes the
[50:59] righteous also
[51:01] complains because of the
[51:03] situation when it's becoming very
[51:06] hot they look out and
[51:09] complain says but if God was really
[51:13] faithful and if he's really God why
[51:16] would I be going through all these
[51:18] challenges but God is eyes never set out
[51:22] of us his eyes are straight on us
[51:27] to look at us to direct our feet and
[51:30] when we are giving up he now comes down
[51:34] to give us strength he says when you're
[51:38] weak then are you strong why my grace is
[51:44] sufficient for
[51:46] you the grace of God is sufficient for
[51:50] us in this J that we are moving the
[51:53] grace of God is sufficient
[51:56] praise the Lord his grace was sufficient
[51:59] upon these people so when they come
[52:02] praying praise the Lord because The
[52:04] Waters at Mar were very bitter when they
[52:08] tested of it it was bitter they
[52:11] complained but it was the working of
[52:15] God was working out
[52:17] patience praise the Lord he says do not
[52:21] do not
[52:22] worry of the
[52:25] suffering of the
[52:27] tribulation of the trials that you shall
[52:30] face because these
[52:32] trials are working out patience for
[52:36] you praise the name of the Living God
[52:39] Abraham the tri he went through we
[52:42] working out patience and when he got a
[52:45] hold of him praise the Lord when he saw
[52:49] the promise he to
[52:51] manifestation he gave up himself and he
[52:55] surrendered to God
[52:56] praise the Lord when we come to the
[52:59] promise of the baptism of the Holy
[53:02] Spirit when we get that
[53:04] confirmation of the life of God in us we
[53:08] surrender ourselves unto him and
[53:10] whatever he says I will do whatever he
[53:14] leads I will follow praise the Lord
[53:17] that's why when God tells
[53:20] Abraham that your boy I want him prepare
[53:25] yourself prepare firewood prepare a good
[53:29] knife I want him
[53:31] tonight Abraham was not
[53:34] hant why because the trials that he had
[53:38] gone through had worked out
[53:41] patience praise the Lord and even when
[53:44] he reached that time of giving up his
[53:47] son Abraham still trusted
[53:50] God why because whatever he had gone
[53:53] through the 25 years
[53:56] buil patience in
[53:58] ABR praise the Living God so now Prophet
[54:02] says they thought God had turned his
[54:04] face from
[54:06] them that is what they they asked in
[54:09] Malachi 13 1 to
[54:13] 13 the burden of the word of the Lord to
[54:16] Israel by
[54:19] Malachi I love I have loved you says the
[54:24] Lord yet we say
[54:27] where in hast thou loved
[54:30] us was not es Jacob's
[54:34] brother say the Lord yet I L
[54:38] Jacob and I
[54:40] hated and his mountains and his Heritage
[54:44] West for the
[54:50] dragons dragons of the
[54:53] Wilderness elective
[54:57] God When the Children of Israel were
[55:00] forcing their way
[55:02] in and they were
[55:04] complaining the Bible says here God
[55:08] asked them isn't es Jacob's
[55:12] brother and yet by elective love I chose
[55:18] Jacob over
[55:19] [Applause]
[55:21] es praise the Lord so when we look at
[55:24] ourselves praise the Lord we do not have
[55:27] to compare
[55:28] ourselves our
[55:31] successes our spiritual
[55:33] stand with the people of the
[55:36] world why because we are a royal
[55:39] seed elective love God has chosen us to
[55:44] be called our special
[55:47] people people he says now among all of
[55:52] them haven't I loved you haven't I
[55:55] showed you my
[55:57] love I showed you my truth why have I
[56:02] rejected why have I loved Jacob why have
[56:05] I rejected the world and why have I
[56:08] chosen you give you my truth has chosen
[56:12] us to give us his truth he will protect
[56:16] his truth us he says chosen
[56:20] jaob
[56:21] rejected and given all his
[56:24] irit to of the of the
[56:27] Wilderness and yet I have loved Jacob
[56:31] and I have blessed him God has loved us
[56:35] God has loved us by
[56:37] himself not because there's something we
[56:40] can do for
[56:41] him Israel thought God would love them
[56:46] because there is something they did and
[56:48] when he looked at them he caued them and
[56:52] says do you think I have loved you
[56:56] you are so many in
[56:58] number yet you the
[57:00] fewest upon the face of the Earth you
[57:03] think I have loved you because you have
[57:06] the best
[57:07] character some of us he found us in the
[57:11] dungeons of the
[57:13] world he found us in the fness of the
[57:16] world and he rejected those that we of
[57:20] character and he chose us amidst our
[57:24] weaknesses he chose us
[57:26] because he loved us because of elective
[57:30] love because he loved us and he wanted
[57:33] to make a bride out of
[57:35] us not because we were wored be called a
[57:38] bride of
[57:40] Christ because of his elective
[57:43] life at
[57:47] Jacob as a man was so
[57:51] sub praise the Lord but yet God loved
[57:54] him look at is
[57:57] very gentle un
[57:59] faithful God
[58:01] rejected God is love is
[58:05] elective praise the Lord so when he
[58:07] loved us he elected us before the
[58:11] foundation of the world he loved us
[58:15] because he chose us to be his bright
[58:19] praise the Lord there's nothing much we
[58:21] can do to
[58:22] it simply because he loved us
[58:26] praise the Lord and now the prophet
[58:28] continues to
[58:30] say now
[58:32] Israel when they were tested of the
[58:34] goodness of the
[58:36] Lord and later fac
[58:39] Affliction became
[58:42] doubtful they started doubting the power
[58:44] of
[58:46] the that delivered them out of Pharaoh's
[58:50] hand why they couldn't understand God is
[58:54] love
[58:57] they couldn't understand his elective
[59:00] love they looked at themselves and often
[59:04] compared with
[59:06] Egypt praise the Lord when they looked
[59:08] at their task
[59:10] Masters they could look at themselves
[59:13] and doubt if truly God loved
[59:16] them and if TR God chose them they
[59:20] looked at pharaoh and they looked at the
[59:23] people in the pharaoh's
[59:24] house how they
[59:27] were they
[59:29] well and they looked at themselves and
[59:32] there was nothing good to them they said
[59:35] but surely there is nothing that God
[59:37] could love to us because we not good
[59:40] after all we don't have the skills to
[59:43] fight but yet God did not set out
[59:47] conditions to choose them and to love
[59:50] them he simply loved them by
[59:53] election he elected them
[59:56] through their fathers and whatever he
[59:59] was doing it was based upon that
[1:00:03] love the scripture tells us praise the
[1:00:06] Lord in Ephesians chapter 1 blessed be
[1:00:11] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:00:14] Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ who has loved us who has chosen
[1:00:19] us who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:00:24] blessings who chose us before the
[1:00:28] foundations of the
[1:00:30] world so that means even before we
[1:00:34] were he had chosen us even before we
[1:00:38] were he had loved us praise the Lord so
[1:00:42] we don't present anything before
[1:00:44] him for him to love us but he loved us
[1:00:48] by
[1:00:49] election praise the Lord and he shows us
[1:00:52] his
[1:00:54] Mercy by election
[1:00:56] he show shows us his
[1:00:58] love all by
[1:01:01] election his love is elective
[1:01:05] love praise the Lord regardless of our
[1:01:09] weaknesses if he has called us has
[1:01:13] chosen us and we have been F of
[1:01:18] him he is not going to turn his face
[1:01:20] away from
[1:01:22] us we can be confident
[1:01:26] that we shall see him we can be
[1:01:29] confident that we shall be in the
[1:01:31] rapture we can be confident that we are
[1:01:34] the bride that God has chosen himself
[1:01:39] because he has chosen reveal his
[1:01:42] Mysteries before us he shows us that we
[1:01:46] can come into
[1:01:48] countenance we can come into count with
[1:01:52] his
[1:01:53] presence in the message of
[1:01:56] the praise the Lord there are so many
[1:01:59] land
[1:02:01] people land
[1:02:03] people who have been
[1:02:05] taught praise the Lord by from the
[1:02:09] beginning are still young they have been
[1:02:12] taught the word they have gone to to
[1:02:17] those kind of of of of studies in the
[1:02:20] church you know what happens in the
[1:02:23] Catholic
[1:02:24] church when the child is
[1:02:26] they given to the church as they grow
[1:02:30] there are certain lessons they have to
[1:02:33] undergo being Tau
[1:02:35] God but yet God did not choose us
[1:02:39] because we were taugh God but he chose
[1:02:42] us because he loved us praise the Lord
[1:02:46] so many of them have been told he has
[1:02:50] not
[1:02:50] chosen chosen us who did not have any
[1:02:53] knowledge of him chosen us who are
[1:02:57] completely lost has given us his word he
[1:03:01] has given us the revelation of the hour
[1:03:04] given us the light of the day that we
[1:03:06] can come into
[1:03:08] countenance with the purpose of God for
[1:03:10] our day is his elective
[1:03:14] love praise the Lord so why should we
[1:03:16] look at
[1:03:18] ourselves and see we our St is not worth
[1:03:22] of him your St has nothing to do with
[1:03:25] his elective love praise the Lord why we
[1:03:29] look at ourselves and our
[1:03:31] backs judges
[1:03:34] ourselves praise the Lord God has not
[1:03:38] chosen us because we have a good
[1:03:42] background in fact if you are to look
[1:03:46] most of us we are chosen from one of the
[1:03:49] worst
[1:03:54] back went out
[1:03:56] and says Abraham I have loved you and I
[1:03:59] have chosen you he says my son daughter
[1:04:04] whether you know not God I have chosen
[1:04:07] you and this is the
[1:04:10] truth and he showed us the
[1:04:13] truth praise the Lord and remember he
[1:04:16] knows that along the way we shall be
[1:04:20] rejected we shall have Mage but yet he's
[1:04:24] patient with us praise the Lord he was
[1:04:27] patient with the children of Israel
[1:04:29] because the purpose of their calling was
[1:04:33] to inherit the land so when they
[1:04:36] mmed God was still
[1:04:39] patient the Bible says in ex
[1:04:44] 16
[1:04:45] verse and the whole Congregation of of
[1:04:48] Israel mmed against Moses and Aaron in
[1:04:52] the wilderness
[1:04:59] and the children of Israel said unto
[1:05:02] them would to God we had died by the
[1:05:06] hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt
[1:05:08] when we sat by the flesh BS and when we
[1:05:12] did eat bread to full for ye have
[1:05:16] brought us forth into this Holiness to
[1:05:18] kill this whole assem with
[1:05:54] that's what they thought
[1:05:56] but yet God not bring them up there to
[1:06:01] St them those
[1:06:04] sufferings would work out
[1:06:07] patience prise the Lord the sufferings
[1:06:10] work out patience and the prophet says
[1:06:13] now it is God that chose these people
[1:06:17] they were not aware of the Covenant God
[1:06:19] made with their
[1:06:21] father Abra moved before God he was
[1:06:24] tested of God
[1:06:26] remained faithful in his
[1:06:28] work praise the Lord and why he never
[1:06:32] chose
[1:06:34] God he never looked for God God looked
[1:06:37] for Abraham God located Abraham so he
[1:06:42] had no effort in the calling and the
[1:06:46] Covenant Abra never had any effort it
[1:06:50] was the elective love that
[1:06:53] God that God located chose
[1:06:56] him and when the trials be
[1:06:59] him he was still
[1:07:02] patient and at some point you
[1:07:04] know he B to the weight of
[1:07:08] care to the weight of
[1:07:13] care praise the Lord and he accepted the
[1:07:16] coun of
[1:07:18] Sarah and he produced isma and at some
[1:07:23] point praise the Lord when when he was
[1:07:26] in
[1:07:27] lack he gave up his wife and says you
[1:07:31] say you are my
[1:07:32] sister he also went through such
[1:07:36] trials praise the Lord but God still
[1:07:40] loved
[1:07:41] him for one reason he was obedient to
[1:07:45] the
[1:07:46] calling praise the Lord and now you see
[1:07:50] they could not figure out God's
[1:07:52] love they saw that love meant not
[1:07:57] suffering they saw that love meant a
[1:08:00] baby with parental
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:04] care but God said that his love was
[1:08:07] elective
[1:08:10] love the proof of his
[1:08:12] love his
[1:08:14] election that no matter what
[1:08:17] happened his love was proven truly by
[1:08:20] the fact that they were chosen un
[1:08:22] salvation
[1:08:26] because God has chosen you to
[1:08:30] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:08:33] spirit and believe of the
[1:08:36] truth so God chose Abraham
[1:08:40] salvation praise the Lord through belief
[1:08:44] of the
[1:08:47] truth he may commit you to
[1:08:50] death he may commit you to
[1:08:52] death as did Paul
[1:08:56] he may commit you to
[1:08:58] suffering as he
[1:09:00] did that is his
[1:09:02] prerogative he is
[1:09:05] Sovereign but it is all with a
[1:09:08] purpose if he did not have a
[1:09:12] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:09:14] frustration and not of
[1:09:18] Peace his purpose is that after we have
[1:09:21] suffered a
[1:09:24] while be made
[1:09:26] perfect be
[1:09:29] established
[1:09:30] strengthened
[1:09:33] settled praise the Lord that is the
[1:09:36] purpose it says that we would be made
[1:09:40] perfect will be established in his
[1:09:43] words we will be strength and
[1:09:48] settled as job said he puts his strength
[1:09:52] in
[1:09:54] US job made perfect by the things he
[1:09:59] suffered see he himself suffered that's
[1:10:03] Jesus and he learned obedience by the
[1:10:06] things which he
[1:10:08] suffered he was actually made
[1:10:11] perfect the things that he
[1:10:13] suff Christ who is our
[1:10:18] footprint a perfect example for
[1:10:22] us he himself he suffered
[1:10:26] you open not his
[1:10:27] mouth to C
[1:10:29] God because he lived the life of a
[1:10:34] purpose to redeem us back to
[1:10:37] himself in Hebrews
[1:10:42] 5: no man makes no man takes his honor
[1:10:45] unto himself but he that is called of
[1:10:49] God as was
[1:10:52] Aon four 54
[1:11:06] so also Christ glorified not himself be
[1:11:08] made an high priest but he that said
[1:11:12] unto him Thou Art my son today have I
[1:11:15] begotten thee
[1:11:27] as he also said in another place thou
[1:11:30] art a priest Forever After the order of
[1:11:40] MEC speaking about Jesus
[1:11:43] Christ verse who in the days of his
[1:11:46] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[1:11:49] supplications with his strong crying and
[1:11:51] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:11:55] from from death and was Hur in that he
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:19] feared though he were a son yet learned
[1:12:22] he obedience by the things which he
[1:12:24] suffer
[1:12:30] and being made perfect he became the
[1:12:32] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:12:35] them that obey
[1:12:48] him
[1:12:50] obedience by the things which he
[1:12:53] suffered he is our
[1:12:56] we learn
[1:12:57] obedience we learn patience by the
[1:13:00] things that we suffer remember the
[1:13:03] beginning of the scripture says the
[1:13:06] prophet when was teaching inan Church
[1:13:08] age he
[1:13:10] said says through your
[1:13:14] suffering I know through your
[1:13:17] tribulation I know through your lacking
[1:13:21] I know and in plain
[1:13:24] language Prophet says the very character
[1:13:27] of
[1:13:28] Jesus was perfected by
[1:13:31] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:13:35] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:13:38] that they to by
[1:13:46] faith in suffering for
[1:13:50] him would come to a place of
[1:13:53] perfection praise the so the prophet
[1:13:56] teaches us here that according the
[1:13:59] teaching of
[1:14:00] PA that Christ has also left a measure
[1:14:04] of
[1:14:06] suffering that's why when we are
[1:14:09] suffering we don't need to Cur God we
[1:14:13] don't need to cry sometimes we shall cry
[1:14:17] because the St may seem
[1:14:20] so praise the Lord but the prophet says
[1:14:23] God has left us a measure of
[1:14:28] by
[1:14:31] fath while we
[1:14:33] suffer where we patiently wait upon the
[1:14:37] Lord through those
[1:14:40] sufferings challenges through the of
[1:14:44] Life while we wait upon God patiently in
[1:14:49] prayer that we would come to a place of
[1:14:53] perfection why he want
[1:14:56] this the Bible says in James 1
[1:15:01] verse
[1:15:03] myen count it all
[1:15:05] joy when you follow into div
[1:15:09] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:15:13] of your faith Works
[1:15:22] patience but let patience have have
[1:15:25] perfect
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:30] work that they that ye may be perfect
[1:15:34] and enti wanting
[1:15:49] nothing has left a
[1:15:51] measure of suffering
[1:15:56] a he says there is no
[1:15:59] temptation there is no trial God allows
[1:16:03] to come your
[1:16:04] way that which you able to
[1:16:07] over so now through that
[1:16:10] moment says God has left us a
[1:16:14] measure that by faith in
[1:16:18] himout that
[1:16:20] moment we come to our place of
[1:16:23] perfection
[1:16:25] we come to our place of
[1:16:27] Victory why does he stand
[1:16:30] by and look on in in in in Romans 8 ver
[1:16:36] 17 and if
[1:16:39] children then
[1:16:43] hairs of God and Joints with
[1:16:48] chist if so be that we suffer with
[1:16:52] him the scripture tells us
[1:16:56] through our
[1:16:57] suffering with our faith in God we are
[1:17:01] suffering together with
[1:17:02] him he does not stand by but he is with
[1:17:06] us through it
[1:17:08] all
[1:17:10] patience praise the Lord bringing us un
[1:17:13] Perfection bringing our
[1:17:16] bodies sub the word of God bring us into
[1:17:20] obedience the word of God that through
[1:17:23] suffering
[1:17:25] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:17:28] glorified
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:31] together for I Recon that the sufferings
[1:17:34] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:17:36] be compared with the joy which shall be
[1:17:39] revealed in
[1:17:44] us 18
[1:18:05] so unless we suffer with him we canot
[1:18:09] with
[1:18:12] him the reason for this is that
[1:18:16] character is never made without
[1:18:20] suffering that's the prophet character
[1:18:23] is a victory
[1:18:25] not a gift a man without character can't
[1:18:29] rain because power apart from character
[1:18:31] is
[1:18:33] satanic
[1:18:41] without so the suffering works out
[1:18:45] character but Power with
[1:18:47] character Fe to
[1:18:50] rule remember the Bible says if we
[1:18:53] suffer with him
[1:18:56] we shall be glorified together with him
[1:18:59] we Ser with him we shall also re with
[1:19:02] him praise the Lord that's the B says
[1:19:06] that the
[1:19:07] suffering that we go through now the
[1:19:11] rejection praise the Lord cannot be
[1:19:15] compared to the glory that shall be
[1:19:18] revealed in Us Praise the Lord so when
[1:19:21] we suffer we suffer together with him
[1:19:25] and same we
[1:19:26] suffer says by faith in
[1:19:30] God we come to our point of
[1:19:33] perfection when we suffer by prayer and
[1:19:38] supplication by prayer and supplication
[1:19:43] we come into patience and he says and
[1:19:46] the little tempor suffering go
[1:19:49] through is not whether to be
[1:19:52] compared that REM Glory that will be
[1:19:55] revealed in
[1:19:56] us when it
[1:19:58] comes oh what Treasures are laid up for
[1:20:01] those that are willing to enter into his
[1:20:04] kingdom through much
[1:20:09] tribulation think it not
[1:20:11] strange the trials that are to try
[1:20:16] you that is what Peter said is it
[1:20:20] strange that God wants us develop a
[1:20:23] Christlike character
[1:20:27] that comes through
[1:20:29] suffering sir and all we have
[1:20:33] trials but we are all tried and
[1:20:38] ched not one but goes through
[1:20:43] that the church that is not
[1:20:46] suffering is not being
[1:20:48] tried hasn't got it it isn't of God
[1:20:53] praise the Lord Hebrews 12:
[1:20:56] 6 for whom the Lord
[1:21:00] L he
[1:21:04] ches every son whom he
[1:21:08] receive but
[1:21:10] if you be without
[1:21:14] tainment where of all are
[1:21:17] partakers are you bastards are not
[1:21:21] Sons now this special condition is must
[1:21:24] be applied to every
[1:21:30] age is no free from
[1:21:34] it there is no True Believer free from
[1:21:38] it this is of god this is the will of
[1:21:42] God it is
[1:21:45] needful we need the law to teach us the
[1:21:48] truth that we are to suffer and be
[1:21:51] Christlike in doing it
[1:21:56] love suff and His
[1:22:01] Kind blessed you when men shall rev
[1:22:06] you and persecute
[1:22:09] you that you sh and shall say all manner
[1:22:12] of evil of evil against you
[1:22:17] falely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:22:21] exceeding glad for great is your in
[1:22:26] heaven for so persecuted they the
[1:22:29] prophets which were before
[1:22:34] you his
[1:22:36] approval of
[1:22:39] of is only in the
[1:22:42] Beloved his love
[1:22:45] is which he had for us before the
[1:22:49] foundation of the
[1:22:51] world does he love us yes
[1:22:55] but how shall we know we shall know
[1:22:58] because he said
[1:23:00] so man that he did love us for he
[1:23:04] brought us unto
[1:23:06] himself and gave us his Spirit blessing
[1:23:10] us
[1:23:11] sons and shall how shall I
[1:23:14] prove my love to him by believing what
[1:23:17] he said and conducting myself with
[1:23:22] joy amidst the trials
[1:23:25] that that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:23:28] come to
[1:23:30] pass
[1:23:32] obedience believing what he said and
[1:23:35] being conducting
[1:23:37] ourselves with joy it is hard is hard
[1:23:43] for us conduct ourselves with
[1:23:45] joy am the
[1:23:47] trials that's what the prophet teaches
[1:23:50] us praise the Lord by conducting our
[1:23:52] soul with joy
[1:23:55] amid the trials that he in his
[1:23:58] wisdom allows to come to
[1:24:01] pass praise the Lord all this work
[1:24:05] together for good to the elect praise
[1:24:10] the Lord Romans 8 as we
[1:24:13] close and we know verse 28 and we know
[1:24:17] that all the things work together for
[1:24:19] good to them that love the Lord to them
[1:24:22] who are called according to his purpose
[1:24:40] 28 for whom he did for for he also did
[1:24:45] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:24:46] image of his son that he might be the
[1:24:49] first born among many brethren
[1:25:11] he knew us
[1:25:13] prated he called us to be
[1:25:17] ConEd the Lord and now it is written in
[1:25:22] Romans chapter 9 for he say to
[1:25:26] Moses I will have
[1:25:28] mercy I will have mercy and I will have
[1:25:32] compassion I have compassion so then it
[1:25:35] is not of
[1:25:37] him that
[1:25:39] will it is not on whom them that will to
[1:25:44] be conformed to Children Of God it's not
[1:25:48] upon them that are of good character be
[1:25:52] ConEd the children of God
[1:25:55] of him that
[1:25:56] run but of God that shows Mercy I will
[1:26:02] have mercy on whom I will have mercy I
[1:26:06] choose Those whom I have mercy so the
[1:26:10] choosing of God is elective he says I
[1:26:14] will have mercy so he mercy upon me
[1:26:18] mercy upon you and he chose you I'll
[1:26:21] have mercy on whom I'll have mercy I'll
[1:26:24] show Grace whom I'll choose to show
[1:26:28] Grace God must choose a
[1:26:31] bright God
[1:26:33] chooses he does not call us to himself
[1:26:36] by accident but calls us because he
[1:26:41] chose us before the foundation of the
[1:26:45] world praise the Living God for thou art
[1:26:49] Unholy
[1:26:51] people the Lord th unto the Lord thy God
[1:26:55] I'll have
[1:26:56] mercy I'll have mercy when we found
[1:27:00] Mercy before his
[1:27:01] sight he says Thou Unholy
[1:27:05] people the Lord thy God the Lord thy God

[1:27:09] thee to be a special
[1:27:12] people to himself above all that upon
[1:27:16] the face of the
[1:27:18] earth and the Lord did not set his love
[1:27:21] upon you
[1:27:24] choose you because we were
[1:27:27] special but because the Lord loved
[1:27:30] us and because he would keep the which
[1:27:34] he saw our
[1:27:37] fathers I will have mercy on whom I'll
[1:27:40] have mercy the love of God is elected
[1:27:45] and his love is shed upon us and it
[1:27:49] keeps us through this journey the eyes
[1:27:53] of the Lord
