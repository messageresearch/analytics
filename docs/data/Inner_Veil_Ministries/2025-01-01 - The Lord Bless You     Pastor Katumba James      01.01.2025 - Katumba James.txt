Lord so let us ourselves and pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the grace that you've given unto us father that we can come before you Lord and worship you Lord for the great things that you have done and bringing us this far Lord blessed be thy name Lord forever we commit ourselves into your hands even this service Lord that you may come and speak to us give us Direction Lord and show us the way father that we have to take we love you Lord and we bless you Lord us all together father Jesus thise amen I don't know if we can get another replacement of this so let us stand to Numbers Chapter 6 Numbers Chapter 6 we're reading from verse 22 to verse 27 the Bible says and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and unto his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them them the Lord bless the and keep Thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them 27 amen praise the name of the Lord seated so I just want to call this text tonight the Lord bless thee amen that is in verse 24 the Bible says the Lord bless thee and keep thee praise the name of the Lord the Lord bless you praise the name of the Lord now in the message as the eest brother Bram says thank you for your kindness for your [Music] offerings and for all you have done then he says I don't know how to say more than that then God bless you andto me that's the greatest word there is if God will bless me everything else will be all right as long as God blesses me praise the name of the Lord you see that's the same thing there is nothing greater than the blessing of God praise the name of our Lord you know the blessings of God the scripture says they make Rich praise the name of our Lord and then they had no sorrow with them they had no sorrow that's what the scripture says I just want to get that scripture in Proverbs chapter 10 and then verse 22 praise the name of our Lord proverbs 10 verse 22 it says the blessings of the Lord it maketh riches and adth no sorrow with it when blesses you it doesn't come with any sorrow it doesn't come with any curse it's a pure blessing praise the name of our Lord and you see the Bible tells us in Genesis that whatever God made it was good everything whatever God made it was good and so it is either us who spoil what God has blessed us with all the people we bring in on board or we allow Satan to come and do things which are not right praise the name of our Lord and then now when we go to Psalms 37 and then verse 22 he says for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cast of him shall be cut off he says if you are blessed of God you will inherit the earth so you see that everything that there is it is God that has made them it is God that has created them even the Bible tells us we are not of Our Own It Is God that has created us it's God that has made us we are the Sheep of his pass and so we need to recognize that that God blesses us praise the name of our Lord but the challenge is sometimes we limit the blessings of godible says it is God that gives us the Sun every day to make it shine upon the evil it's God who has blessed us with the sun it's God who makes it rain it's God who gives us the breath of life it is God who blesses us with all that we have need of it's God who protects you at night it's God who gives you strength to rise up in the morning it's God who gives you the opportunity of the things that you do praise the name of our Lord the places of work your businesses your Gardens praise the name of our God like there's a place in the town near where I'm staying in the town now there is a por meal I used to stay near that place actually some years ago so now you would pass around that area opposite as you're going home now that por me they por and then they sell it as you know either wholesale or retail and you find many women there each woman with you know her merchandise with her por and then they are sitting outside the POR and all the time they as if trying to talk to somebody each individually and now when you are passing by everybody is saying please come and buy me come and buy me come and buy so you can have your goods but nobody is taking them but you find that you can like you go to the market you find this St has tomatoes and every vegetable even this one here this one here from the entrance up to continue but being at the entrance doesn't mean that you're going to get all those people that's how funny it is somebody will just come and walk you are sing what they but they bypass you then they go to somebody maybe having worse than this others go where many people are then don't want where congestion so it is God who decides who should go where the Bible says the casting of the the dice I think it's called a dice or to cast a vot it is God who deter who is the winner it's God who determines which side like when you have a coin it has a head and a tail so it is God who determines which side is coming up for you throw it up I've lost God has decided that praise the name of he decides praise the name of our Lord there are things you can't humanly determine but God purposes that praise the name of our Lord now in the Book of Daniel Daniel then we read in chapter 4: 16 the scripture says let his heart be changed from manies and let a beast heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him this matter is by decree of the Watchers and the demand by the word of the Holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and give to ever he will and sets up over it the beest of men PR the name of the Lord he says we should know that God rules in the Kingdom of men rules in the Affairs of men praise the name of because the first place is the life you have he has given to you he has given to you it's not difficult for God say Spirit come out and the Man is dead just only that's the thing very simple when Herod exalted himself praise the name of our Lord the scripture says the angel of God went and SM him and he died praise the name of the Angels SM him and he died now let us go to the the book of Acts chapter 12 and then verse 20 let us go to verse 21 and Upon a the Herod ared in Royal April sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them you know the way he spoke an orator you know like a politician can just come and speak and say ah he's the man he's the one you know the way he spok saying yeah and politicians don't care what they speak as long as they are pleasing the people lies whatever say yeah he the man then they stand up and clap now when Herod gave such an excellent speech to the people verse 22 and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a God and not a man he exalted himself and everybody was saying now this man has made peace with his enemy to rule Worth to be there God verse 23 and immediately the angel of the Lord SM him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of WMS and gave up the ghost he died before those were praising him that praise the name of the same thing with Nebuchadnezzar when he saw that he was the King of Kings over the Earth said you see what I have done you see my glory you see all my kingdom then the Lord said okay I'm going to make you a beast you going to leave the people your nails are going to grow like crows then your body is going to be like feathers and so on you are going to eat like an animal praise the name of the Lord and the scripture says because he didn't exalt God and so now when God blesses us when God lifts us up in any particular place he gives you a particular position for He blesses you above your brethren or above every person in your community or above every person in the church you need to stay humble praise the name of our you need to keep yourself humble and you don't use your excellent gift you don't use your excellent kind of you know Glory that God has put upon you to throw down others you may be a boss at a place of work until thear they just see the they just run run very fast open the Gat the secretary immediately she she stands up when they see you they just stand up immediately the office Messengers they just have to stand upright you need to humble yourself praise the name of the Lord you know there are some bosses they come to you waiting you to greet them you don't greet how about you praise the name of there are some people like that even you find at home also the father just sits there waiting for the children to come and him you [Music] not show them the example praise the name or the husband or the wife you know it is not difficult those junor staff at your place of work give them respect how are you how have you been and you see that's how you connect with people if you can get down to their level then they can be free with you but if you're going to be high like this this you know as children of God God expects us to have the meekness of Christ the humility of Christ he would go down to the fisherman sits with them in the boat praise the name of our Lord but is the king of glory the lord of hosts but then he would go down to the levels of people and Paul say I had to become that to win them to the weak I become weak to this one I become this that I may win them to Christ praise the name of the Lord so then God blesses us and whatever we have need of you couldn't have any need if there is no solution to it so whatever need there is God is able to provide for it praise the name of the Lord now in Genesis chapter 24 verse 34 praise the name of our Lord herea was saying I am Abraham's servant Genesis 2:4 and the Lord has blessed my master greatly and he is become great praise the name of our Lord God blessed him and he became great and he has given him flocks Hearts silver and gold and Men servants and made servants and camels and asses these are physical blessings and now you see that each of them which is being mentioned is a blessing flocks not one flock but [Music] manys you know sheep countless now only those things can make make you rich but the Bible says even silver it's enough to make you rich but he also gave him gold and he didn't stop at that even gave him many that means could AFF to take care of them made made made servants he could take care of them I don't know how how many house girls were there this one does this this one does this one does know like there are some have big houses that you need somebody to only clean the glasses another clean the floor only another cleans the C [Music] only then you have the che [Music] then you know many different ones then the G this one cuts the flowers and ranges in the he had all that praise the name of the Lord he could afford that then he had the camels like would say we have the Cs because he had those camels he could make chariots then he had the asses everything the Bible says God had blessed praise the name of the Lord now the Bible says in John 3: 26 and they came unto John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan whom thou bearest witness behold the S baptizes and all men come to him John answered and said a man can receive nothing except be given to him from heaven praise the name of the Lord so John answered and say a man cannot receive anything except be given to him from heaven so all that you are is because God has granted you to praise the name of our and all that you desire it's only God who can say okay let it be so praise the name of our Lord and so we need to see that we have confidence in God for our lives every day that you live and God being faithful has given you the life to raise in morning know that there is what God has determined to bless your way praise the name of our Lord so you don't have to live like a dute you know I don't know why you wake up in the morning you are complaining suppos you died at night but you are healthy now I don't have the this week I don't have this now the the month has ended why don't you thank God for what he has made you to praise the name of our why do you have little faith if God has given you the life what is clothing what is clothing let us go to Matthew chapter 6 praise the name of the Lord Matthew and then we read from from verse verse 27 which of You by taking thought can add oneit unto his St so you get troubled what am I going to eat what am I going to drink what am I going to dress on it's a new year my clothes are T my Garden has not done well last season School Fe is at the end of this month and then your mind is traveled and then he says can you really add a CH to your St by thinking and Jesus says that is a very small thing and then he says in verse therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on now this is the thing we need to put out mind on he says is not the life more than meat and you look at it that way he says the life you have which is important which is important what is important the life or the food which to you is more important now if you say life then the question is has God given you the life or you give it to yourself praise the name of Lord now if God has given you the life which is more important than the one who has given you the life you give you the food praise the name of that's what he's saying the body which is more important but you not put on if you don't have the body so he has given you the body so if he has given you the body he dress the body and he gives examples when it comes to dressing he says the Le of the valley he says Solomon in all his wisdom he would not dress like the lily of the V and then brother Bram says the cloth of Solomon they never had life but the of the valley their beauty it was life praise the name of our Lord and then it talks about the birds they don't have Gardens where they saw they don't have stores where they store but it says God fits them says you more important those things praise the name of so then you need to have confidence in God that as the Lord has brought me this far praise the name of the Lord he has good plans for you he says I know the thoughts I think about to bring you to an expected end so that you need to have confidence in the Lord that will provide all that I have need of praise the name of our Lord God blesses us every day He blesses us when you move out He blesses you when you come in He blesses you it's a continuous blessing from the Lord and so we need to see that we thank God for everything no wonder what the Bible says count your blessings and you will be surprised to see what the Lord Has Done praise the name of our Lord a lot of things he has done for us and a lot of things going do for us praise the name of Lord let us Goomy CH 28 Deuteronomy chapter 28 and then we read from verse one praise the name of the Lord the Bible says and it shall come to pass if youen diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe all that his Commandments which he commands you that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and over thee and you shall if you shall hearen to the voice of the Lord your God so he says all the blessings shall come upon you and overtake you in other words you are just surrounded by the blessings praise the name of and wherever you go you are blessed praise the name of our Lord but the thing he says if youen to the word of God that's all God requires from us obedience to his word and then it releases all the blessings at home you are blessed at a place of work you are blessed among your colleagues you are blessed in your family you are blessed everywhere you are blessed you know when you start reading this DET 28 he starts mentioning one by one in verse he says blessed shall you be in the city if you if you like City life he says I will bless you you know City Life is challenging sometimes when you are in town you get money in this hand this is going out one passes with bananas you buy now it's going out even water you pay then another pass another thing you you pay at the end of the day you realize you only worked enough to eat from hand to the mouth mon goes a month goes havei praise the name of sometimes that's the challenging life in town but God has promised us that even if you are in town you'll be blessed in other words you'll have enough with you you'll not only get and send out but what comes is more than enough take care of you until you still remain with some that's the promise of God you get a job of course when you in town many times you are renting because you cannot afford to build houses wherever you're going to work so you have enough money to R you have enough money to treat yourself you have enough money to feed yourself you have enough money to transport yourself and you have enough money to do other things that's what the Lord is telling that even if you're in town I will give you enough if you are living in a village praise the name of our he says I also give you enough but young people don't young people don't want to be in villes so you get others selling their land in the village and then they get a motorcycle and come and work in they have big land in the village Mong are there they just fall down and Ro and is spending money in town so anywhere God can bless you and on any job God can bless you any job God can bless you now you can say you know my profession there are not many opportunities but if it is the way God has ordained for you than God for God what God praise the name of and God will bless you that if it is transport business God will bless you there praise the name if it is farming business God will bless you there if it is selling in the market God will bless you there praise the name of our Lord so everywhere God can bless you so he says he will bless you in the city he will also bless you in the and then he says blessed shall be the fruit of your body your children praise the name of our Lord the fruit of your ground the fruit of your CLE the increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store in other words where you store the things God has blessed you with God will protect those you not keep your money in the bank and then they steal it you not put your money in the bank and then they close it no he says even where you store your things you not put your your cereals in the storehouse and then they wrote from there all your store is burn up you know he says he will bless even now so he takes care from the beginning the end praise the name of our Lord if you can only allow go to take charge of praise the name of our Lord then he says the Lord shall CA thine enemies right ver six blessed shall you be when you come in and blessed shall you be when you go out the Lord shall cause thine enemies to rise up the Lord shall cause thy enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before you your face they shall come out against the one way and they shall flee seven ways the Lord shall command a blessing upon thee in thy stor houses and in order that th set thine hand and shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God give the praise the name of says what you put your hand on praise the name of maybe driving he will bless youing [Music] crafts maybe making Ms and all those kind of different things he will bless you praise the name of our Lord so you don't run from this don't get praise the name of and you know there is a proverb in that you have to change around also something like that but when God has blessed you here he will sustain it praise the name of he will sustain it that's how the Lord does praise the name of our Lord he says whatever you put your hand on he will bless it and he will bless the in the land that the Lord has given the Lord shall establish the in the Unholy people unto himself as he has unto thee if thou shall keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways all the people of the Earth shall see thee that th called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of you praise the name of the blessings of God He blesses everything what comes out of your body He blesses what your hand touches He blesses where you live he blessings everything praise the name of our Lord so then we need to see that we obey the word of God and not only obeying the word of God making sure that God himself is with you praise the name of our Lord Brother said that all that I need praise the name of Lord if God blesses me and if he blesses me every else will be all right as long as the Lord bless and that's what we need to be certain that the Lord is with me the Lord resides in my heart the Lord rules in myair the Lord rules in my family the Lord rules in my life so if any sickness comes you call upon the name of the Lord and the sickness goes look what Moses leading 2 million people from Egypt to the promised land for 40 years they didn't have tankers of water they didn't have they didn't have storehouses of food they didn't have textile Industries to make clothes for them they didn't have but the presence of God with them met every need that they had when they needed water the Rocks would give the water praise the name of the Lord when they were in the desert you know it is interesting it was a pill of fire at night what was it doing giving them the light they didn't have a power Dum there hydroelectric Dam there give them the light and the energy but the pillar of fire give them enough light and enough warms at night then the pillar of fire would become a cloud and that cloud would be a number umbrella the son would not hit them just having the presence of God with you he will take care of everything that concerns your life we just say Lord come and take charge over me come and reside in my heart come and live in me that he can live his own life praise the name of Lord in the message Abraham's he says now we find out he says let us get a little backrounds on Abraham now last night we find that Abraham was just an ordinary man is that right yeah Abra was an ordinary man like you like me so God can bless any of us so you don't people I'm not that even all the They poor no God can bless you regardless of the family you come God can bless you regardless of the community you live in God can bless you regardless of your tribe or your language or whatever God can bless you praise the name of then he says today when God blesses a person then the people think he has to be a real old petul it's just unordinary man make him a holy man some great some come down through generations of holy men and has to no that is not it so you don't look at your lineage my grandfather used to sleep [Music] in my father died without a house I think will die on the road you don't think like that God can turn around praise the name of [Music] from to somebody is a prince a great praise the name of our lord it's just the blessings of God so we shouldn't limit God sometimes you can limit God by you know the opportunities you have or maybe by the level of your education [Music] I don't understand things but you find who never went School employing professors they give them the jobs they sign their paychecks so you can't say you know that thing is hard God blesses praise the name of He blesses you can imagineer I wonder when ptif had to stand before Joseph you can imagine that being a slave in P's house quite a number of years and then one day God lifs Joseph and put for us to B down to Joseph B down praise the name just go changed it like this praise the name of our Lord then says the Bible sayah was just a man subject to like passions as we are he was just a man Abraham was just a common fellow that came down an old man come from down from Babylon and went down to the land of the Char and the City of just anary man him and his wife probably a poor farmer whatever they did for a living and when God met Abraham he was aner praise the name of Lord was an Ider but then it pleased God to choose Abraham and it has pleased God to choose Us Praise the name of so you don't put yourself out of the picture you need to put yourself right in the picture praise the name of you put yourself right there praise the name then there is another in the message influence he says now we find out though a good man blessed of God but if God blesses you you stay in the category that God has called you in he was talking about you know he was a great king until he did a lot of things and his influence made Isaiah just Look to Him Isaiah could not see until took then Isaiah about the so when God blessed him he also wanted to go into the PRI office in so he says if it is a housewife remain a housewife if is a business remain in that business reflecting God whatever God has called you to let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife reflect your influence upon another person that would want want to be a good hous if you are a good businessman let your life be so that it will reflect Jesus Christ in your business praise the name of Lord you know businessmen they always like Propet even the one which is not right they want it you have given him more money maybe you have miscounted and given him more money he counts it says let me find out is it okay and this time maybe he may hide where he's counting from and then so these not are two but he counts as if it is one yeah you are right but he knows that there's some extra there why don't you declare it you've given me more money this is all that I need this is your money you're reflecting Christ praise the name of you don't that has blessed me that's not God you've G to a sh they have given you 5,000 maybe it's at night thinking that's 2,000 and then the tomatoes are for 2,000 tomatoes are for 2,000 okay the Mone is here and then the other turns to go away with the tomatoes please come there bance here praise the name of there's a time I went to a market in Toro I don't know what I was buying but I was buying something I either of G or something very expensive a qu a kilo and then now this person who was measuring he got a 200 g and then he put there then he measured then he gave me I said this is what I said he said a this thing is 200 g you know they want make profit even they not meant to make upright you say one Kil your scale be one k praise the name of don't again put excuses you I'm going to pay you 10,000 today now you see the person has finished everything but you negotiated why do you want to cut down why are your scales not balancing and the Bible says it's an Abomination before God so then he says if you are a businessman let your life be so that it reflect Jesus Christ in your business with honesty and [Music] and with things that really mean something because somebody is watching your life you are influencing somebody God has to be God has to have a real housewife God has to have a real Teenage in school God has to have a real Minister a real businessman somebody that will reflect him because there they see in you Christ no matter what the rest of the world has got to do that has nothing to do with you oh I we are responsible to God for our lives and for our experiences with Christ praise the name of our so you have to reflect Christ in whatever you're doing you know reflecting the word of God like when you read in the scriptures I believe it is Ephesians chapter 6 and you see the Bible gives us instructions in verse one he says let as many servants as are under the Y Count Their Own Masters worthy of all that the name sorry this is first Timothy it is Ephesians chapter 6 praise the name of the Lord but interesting the scripture concerns that what I was was thinking about let us go to Ephesians chapter 6 he says children obey your parents then he talks about fathers then ver talks about servants then again he talks about Masters so he positionally places everybody what you are meant to do wherever God has blessed you to be the work that you're doing the things that occupy you your be the best at that when we come to the services of God let us also be diligent in the services of the knowing that I serve God praise the name of if I'm responsible for equipment let me do it Faithfully if I'm responsible for music let me be faithful in it if responsible preaching let me be faithful in it if I'm responsible for arranging this place let me be faithful for it if I'm responsible for the fs of the church faithful in it whatever God has blessed us to do you are serving the lord and then you do it reflecting Christ in your and that's how the Lord blesses when you are Faithfully serving him in what he has put before you praise the name of our Lord and keeps on blessing you and now the blessings are not only limited to the physical things but good health is a blessing While others are falling sick all the time God blesses you with good the other person may be earning a lot of money but alls up in hospital build and when you have a sick child you can never have peace praise the name of but here there's no sickness at home you happy some of these are spending a lot to get a small piece but now God's presence is with you whatever you have need you may not have the money but you see God opening opportunity and you get it you don't have F accounts but God knows when you have need of this his supplies praise the name of our Lord they needed the water God would cause water come out of The Rock when they needed the heat the pill of fire was there when they needed the shade the cloud was there everything and brother Bram says they were under do Moses and his medicine was the Lord heals all your diseases they worked for 40 years their souls were not swollen their shes never got T their clothes never got Tor I wonder what kind of material that was these days you buy a shoe you put it on and then when you are walking it goes off then you start seeing somebody carrying shoes in the hand you buy a shirt or and sometimes you can't sit in a tax and some of those taxes have Shar points when you when you get up to get somebody come out but these ones 40 years their cloth is Never B out praise the name of our Lord so we just need to see that the Lord is with us and the Lord really blesses us then let us continue in that message influence 54 which we read before then he says now we find out that in his trying to take a Minister's place and someone telling him he's out of place telling him he shouldn't do that he out of place he became angry so he wased until his face turned so even in our service we need humility praise the name of the Lord allow to be corrected where you are doing wrong and you take it in good faith praise the name of our and you know like maybe you are the only person doing something and then they tell this thing is not right don't say next week I'm not going to be around let them know that I'm the only person who can do that you don't do that you humble yourself take the correction in good you don't say that I'm nobody else can do it that church is depending on me praise the name of Lord you know you be humble and the scripture says if you humble yourself then the Lord exalts praise the name of our but then if you exalt yourself then the Lord praise the name of our Lord so you just need to see that you serve the Lord with all your heart all the ability the Lord has given the humility that required of us knowing that we are serving God praise the name of our Lord that's what we need our time is running fast and I have to cut short many things now let us just get into another Direction here now let us in the scriptures which we first read the Bible says in Numbers Chapter 6 and then verse 22 the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel saying them now you see that in the next three verses the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you the Lord lift up his continence upon you and give you peace there's nothing like money mentioned here there's nothing like mentioned here there's nothing like animals or what but the blessing here is God himself to be reflected in your life praise the name of our Lord he reflects in your life by keeping you he reflects in your life by his glory upon your life he reflects in your life by the favor that he gives you thece people will be surprised how you handle things said ah I wish I could do way he does it people will be surprised how you overcome Temptations people will be surprised it is Grace that God gives you like Joseph God blessed the house of ptif because of Joseph but you look at the Temptation that came to Joseph it was the grace of God to overcome that Temptation so God blesses us with his presence that whatever you have need of praise the name of the Lord He blesses it it whatever comes out of your mouth comes to pass praise the name of the Lord so at our families don't start cursing your children but bless your children praise the name of our Lord tell them what you want them to be and they can what [Music] you that this child is stupid he has done something stupid he has done something stupid even if he has done something wrong encourage them to do better not to condemn them no wonder you have done this because you are foolish no lift them up out of that Str you can do better you have Tred continue praise the name of the Lord so now he says tell speak to the sons of Aon and his sons Aon and his sons were priests so he was telling the priesthood to bless the children of Israel and then now when we go in the Book of Malachi Malachi chapter let us read verse one it says and now all you pre the Commandment is for you if you will not hear and if you'll not lay it to the heart to give Glory unto my name sayith the Lord of hosts I will even send a curse upon you and I will cast your blessings yeah I have casted them already because you not lay it to heart so he says that the priests had blessings they would Bless the people but when the priesthood turned away from the word of God would don't Bless the people instead the blessings becomes a cur and these are the places where the message of the hour is not preached instead of blessing the people with eternal life people get into bondage praise the name of our Lord but where the word of God is ministered it's a blessing praise the name of our Lord we are blessed so whenever we come to church we come to receive blessings praise the name of no the Bible say should not avoid assembling together sometimes you can come when you weak but when you attend a service you find you've been forgotten that you were weak you come when you are troubled when you have come in the presence of God all those fears you had go like Jacob praise the name of the Lord when he was moving from from lean's place was going to the land of promise he was afraid to meet his brother until he met an angel at night and he wrestled with the angel and then the angel said let me go before it is bright that following day Jacob was able to meet his brother Esa without any fear all the fear had gone away the protection of God was upon that's when we also come to the services of the Lord praise the name of our Lord He blesses us praise the name of our Lord he takes away your fears he takes away your diseases he opens doors for you he gives you a better understanding praise the name of our now in verse seven the Bible says for the LIF for the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the Lord of host [Music] praise the name of he say the messenger of God the priest is the messenger of God so he must have the mind of God he must know the will of God praise the name of you know like there are many challenges we Face through in life you may have your own understanding but now when you go to the P he has a better you may be thinking this way thinking you are right but now when you come and consult it gives you a better view of the issue praise the name of our so don't offer praise the you have your own thing disturbing you you hold it there you get ccel from your friends neighbors or colleagues because there is wisdom that God gives the minister over an issue and now when you come before a pastor praise the name of you know there are some issues people hold for themselves they just dodge around but if the pastor cannot sa Vision he will base on what you are telling him and then he gives you the Cel but then the right thing you are holding it the other side you just you just set the small thing and then the other right you're holding like there's a person who came telling me about their past life how they got saved said okay but God is gracious and then but the statement the person said and I was like but it was like an idol statement but I said anyway maybe I P left it there but I just said okay just keeping Christ and everything now after two years you get the true story of what she was telling you I said but why didn't he tell at this time but now the thing has become worse than it was and somebody doesn't come to church because of the background they went through but they couldn't seek cancel out be helped out of so we need to see that you are open be sincere and say okay this is the thing this is the thing this is the thing and then you can can be helped praise the name of the Lord so the scriptures told us that that because people seek the law at his mouth what is the mind of God about my because God has anointed and there are things you can see different from what you can see praise the name of so you don't do things there in hiding surprise I'm going to give them a surprise the surprise may be a shock you the person who bring a surprise it shocks you now what can I do praise the name of you start talking to a sister talking brother and things have gone and you can't be helped praise the name of the Lord so the ministry has been given the blessings to bless the people praise the name of our Lord now in the message hearing receiving and acting brother Bram says Inspire your servants the ministers our gracious and precious Brothers the Shepherds of the FL that you have called out and set apart dedicated lives to the service we pray for them Lord for they are the men that will car the inep that will take the sick people of the soul and body and keep powering in oil and [Music] wine until they are well it is said in the parable that he gave them two p that was for both salvation and healing and said if there is anything more I will pay it when I come so brother BR is saying here that the minister God has given him to p and the one stands for your salvation you know whatever bondage that you have so that when you come before the presence of God there is ability there is power to losen you from that kind of bondage so don't allow that bondage to hold you there is power there is Grace to release you from that bondage to make your salvation sure praise the name of the Lord not only but even healing praise the name of our Lord there is healing in the word there is healing when you come in the presence of God so then you don't just run away when you are in any kind of situation which is not pleasant come and be helped come and be delivered praise the name of our Lord and then now we go to another message in the message jeel religion he says remember the Good Samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him in the in that is the church and gave the man two p and told him if he needed any more he would pay him when he come so he's got to he's able to doctor you up if he's a man of God if he's a man of God that stands on the word of God is's got what God give him the spirit and the word is that right how is it that we are to Worship in the spirit and in the truth and the word is the truth the name of so now you see the ministry God has given it salvation and him God has given it the word and the spirit the Holy Spirit praise the name of our so as the word is ministered the blessings of God come down the blessing of Salvation comes down the blessing of healing comes down the blessing of the Holy Spirit comes down the blessing of the word of God comes down to give you knowledge and understanding wisdom how to handle the things that bind you how to handle the challenges that you go through praise the name of our so we need see that we are always in The Fellowship of the Lord when the doors are open because the ministry has been instructed to bless you praise the name of our Lord so you come and say Lord this is my need and then the Lord in his grace he gives us what we have need of praise the name of our Lord let me see I can finish now let us go to Revelations 1 verse3 praise the name of our Lord the Bible says blessed is he that read and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand we need blessings it says when you read the word you are blessed when you hear the word on the TS in audio recordings when you are in church you are blessed and when you do these things you are blessed praise the name of our Lord God blessing us it is unlimited how much God can bless praise the name of our Lord you look at Abraham with all those things God has blessed them with cattle God has blessed them with ship God has blessed him with God he didn't only bless him in farming but even in treasury gold silver everywhere people would turn blessed it is for that how many does he have what about that also belongs to and they say that God gives blindly once God blesses He blesses you praise the name of our and the Bible say His blessings they make you rich and they had no sorrow with them praise the name of our Lord and the song says count your blessings and you'll be surprised what the Lord has done so much praise the name of our Lord God blesses us he has blessed us he's blessing us and continually bless us so that we are called The Blessed of the Lord and when God blesses you you also become a blessing praise the name of our Lord you can bless others you can encourage them you can strengthen them you can lift them up praise the name of our Lord because you are blessed of the Lord and when God blesses any of us we need to Rejoice together What the Lord Has praise the name of our Lord Lord I Thank you for my Lord I Thank you for my sister and then you are thankful don't develop a negative heart you know an eny you know jealous [Music] Spirit you know you don't have a b because God has blessed don't be like jph they hated him for his gift one also and then there's another person I was reading of in the Bible here hated AB because God blessed AB you don't do that but you rejoice together for What the Lord Has Done praise the name of our Lord that God has blessed my brother God has blessed my son praise the name of our Lord we just need to Rejoice together praise the name of our Lord and now as we live let us desire this let us go to m 16 and then verse 17th 16 and verse 17 to8 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed though Simon for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven Revelation is a blessing when God makes himself known unto you I believe that's the greatest blessing that we we are here in church because God has made himself known Us Praise the name of there is no greater blessing than that other M will disapp come for name but when God makes himself known unto you nobody can take it from you no situation can take it from you no circumstance can take it from so personal praise the name of the Lord Joseph was Brethren they thought they would take that from him let him take let usell him or kill him and see what will come of his dreams they didn't know they were promoting the dream praise the name said how can we our to down your how can we Stars the moon the sun go down before your they wouldn't take it away from Joseph praise the name of the Lord so we need to desire God to reveal himself to us and when God reveals himself it gives you strength until the Bible says that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it doesn't matter how much the Devil May fight the devil can fight you for your understanding of the word of the Revelation that God has given the devil can fight you praise the name of our for the life that God has given you a life where you are submissive to God the life of God flowing in you maybe as a sister at a place of work a sister in a place of work the fear of God has made you dress right you don't add makeup on yourself then the fellow women start despising you all talking against you why do you want to with her hear what that woman she's a special one then that one is like an old woman because you're not doing what they doing but whatever they will say will not take what you are instead the talk is the more you are you are lifted up praise the name of our they can't take it from you the grace that God has given you to live a true Christian Life praise the name of the Bible says Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against you praise the name of our Lord and that's what we should be the most important thing before God make yourself known to me let me know your way praise the name of let me know your PA and then you will see the grace of God always coming down at your home in your business plac you know in your family in your place of work and people will start wondering praise the name of our Lord because the Lord has blessed you praise the name of our Lord so the Lord blesses us and these blessings they are continuous praise the name of the Lord you know in Joshua chter one we shall not read God was telling Joshua for you to make your way prosperous the word and that's the same thing that we need obedience to the wife make prosperous God will bless you in everything whatever you have need of and he said if you need more I'll give it that's what God told David he said I've given you this I've given you this I've given you this and he told him if it was not enough I have added you so and so and that's the same promise that we have praise the name of our Lord we stand on the Promises of God God has blessed us blessed be the name of our Lord he has blessed us with whatever we have need of everything God has blessed us praise the name of our Lord let us go to Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love it says all spiritual blessing but where are they in Christ let us have Christ in us then we shall have all the blessings of God all that we have need he has blessed us with praise the name of our Lord let us go to First Peter second Peter chapter one and then verse one it says Simon Peter a servant and apost of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us so you must be in the like Precious fa the true Faith that's how you access all these blessings then he says through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ Our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness his power has given unto us all things whatever we have need of he has given unto us praise the name of and then he says through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through the last praise the name of our he has given us all things praise the name of the Lord we just need to give him all Our Lives everything that we praise the name of and so as we go
