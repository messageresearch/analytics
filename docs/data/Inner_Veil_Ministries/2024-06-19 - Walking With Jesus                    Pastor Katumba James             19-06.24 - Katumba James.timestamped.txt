[17:17] tonight amen Luke 8 verse 40 to verse
[17:26] 50 the Bible says
[17:29] and it came to pass that when Jesus was
[17:31] returned the people gladly received him
[17:34] for they were all waiting for
[17:44] him and behold there came a man named
[17:48] jaras and he was a ruler of the
[17:50] synagogue and he fell down at Jesus's
[17:53] feet and besought him that he would come
[17:56] into his house
[18:10] for he had only one daughter about 12
[18:12] years of age and she L dying but as he
[18:16] went the people thred him
[18:41] and a woman having an issue of blood 12
[18:44] years which had spent all her living
[18:48] upon Physicians neither could be healed
[18:50] of any came behind him and touched the
[18:54] border of His Garment and immediately
[18:56] her issue of blood was touched
[19:14] andus said who touched me when all the
[19:17] night Peter and they that were with him
[19:21] said Master the multitud thr thee and
[19:23] press thee and say though who touched me
[19:43] Jesus said somebody has touched me for I
[19:46] perceive that virtue is gone out of
[19:54] me and when the woman saw that she was
[19:56] not hid she came trembling and falling
[20:00] down before him she declared unto him
[20:03] before all the people for what cause she
[20:05] had touched him and now she was healed
[20:27] immediately and he said unto her
[20:29] daughter be of good Comfort thy faith
[20:31] has made thee whole go in
[20:40] peace while he yet spoke there come one
[20:43] from the ruler of the s's house saying
[20:45] to him thy daughter is dead trouble not
[20:49] the master
[21:03] but when Jesus heard it he answered him
[21:06] saying fear not believe only and she
[21:08] shall be
[21:16] made amen sing of his
[21:20] word I want to preach on Walking With
[21:25] Jesus walking with Jesus
[21:29] praise the name of the Lord we see a
[21:31] very interesting
[21:34] story that Jesus was called by
[21:40] jaras and then
[21:42] jaras and you see brother preached a
[21:45] message and called it jaras the secret
[21:51] believer and now he called him and he
[21:54] was moving with them
[21:58] and then along this
[22:00] way praise the name of our Lord and you
[22:04] see if you can look at this story of
[22:08] Jesus he
[22:10] meets and then they start
[22:13] moving and then the people are
[22:15] collecting Around
[22:17] Jesus you know kind of like pressing
[22:20] him and then now again the Bible leaves
[22:26] jaras and then the attention go goes to
[22:28] the woman with a blood
[22:32] issue and if you can read in the
[22:35] scriptures that is even how the Bible is
[22:39] written it can start with
[22:42] thises it
[22:44] halfway then start something else
[22:47] finishes it then goes back to where it
[22:50] started
[22:51] from and when you also read in the Book
[22:53] of
[22:54] Revelation you find those kind of areas
[22:59] praise the name of our even in the
[23:01] message of
[23:02] brother you know he starts on this he
[23:06] leaves it halfway he gets into another
[23:08] thing then again he goes back to
[23:11] what so you must be
[23:14] patient you know to follow the whole
[23:18] story and you see even that's how the
[23:20] Holy Spirit searches
[23:23] USA the
[23:28] you know like in the
[23:30] discernment brother Bram would be on the
[23:33] prayer
[23:34] line when he talking to this person then
[23:37] the Holy Ghost moves in the
[23:39] congregation say there is somebody like
[23:42] this and this and
[23:43] this oh there's again another one then
[23:46] again he comes back here and that's how
[23:48] the Holy Spirit keep on
[23:51] moving and we see the same thing here is
[23:54] that jaras was moving with the Lord
[23:58] and then then people were moving with
[24:00] the
[24:01] Lord but then there was a
[24:04] woman who had a blood
[24:08] issue and then the scripture
[24:10] says she determined within
[24:14] herself to touch the Lord Jesus
[24:17] Christ many people were walking with the
[24:20] Lord and then others were pressing him
[24:24] master all you are nice we have to have
[24:27] you around maybe like a social
[24:30] Gathering and we can also
[24:33] realize that we walk with
[24:36] Christ but how often do we realize that
[24:38] we are walking with
[24:41] Christ praise the name of our how often
[24:44] does it come to our
[24:46] attention how maybe sensitive do we
[24:49] become that we are walking with the
[24:52] Lord praise the name of our Lord look
[24:55] atus and his friends
[24:58] when we go to the Book of
[25:01] Luke Luke chap
[25:04] 24 and then the Bible
[25:10] says and then verse
[25:13] 13 and behold two of them went the same
[25:17] day to a village called Emos which was
[25:20] from Jerusalem about three
[25:41] and they walked and they talk together
[25:45] of all the things which had
[25:51] happened and it came to pass that while
[25:53] they communed together and reasoned
[25:57] Jesus himself Drew nigh and went with
[26:09] them but their eyes were Holden that
[26:13] they should not know
[26:19] him you know they were talking about
[26:22] Christ and brother Bram tells us when
[26:25] you talk about God that's when he
[26:29] comes praise the name of our Lord when
[26:32] you think about him when you start
[26:34] praising him also draws
[26:37] near we need to see that we have these
[26:41] opportunities that we can talk about God
[26:45] we can commune with God likeus and his
[26:49] friends they were talking while they
[26:51] were going
[26:52] to and then Jesus joined them but then
[26:56] they didn't know that Christ had joined
[26:58] them
[26:59] and started asking him what are you
[27:00] talking
[27:01] about and said you don't know what has
[27:03] happened in
[27:05] Jerusalem praise the name of our Lord
[27:08] and so
[27:09] now brother Bram tells us if we can go
[27:13] in this message the unwelcomed
[27:16] Christ praise the name of our Lord he
[27:19] says Jesus is here
[27:23] tonight Jesus keeps his appointment
[27:29] when he
[27:32] appoints that I'm going to be
[27:35] here he says he keeps his
[27:39] appointments no matter how you or where
[27:43] you
[27:44] are he kept his appointment with Jonah
[27:48] in the belly of a
[27:51] well he kept his appointment with Daniel
[27:54] in the Lion's death
[27:58] he kept his appointment with the
[28:00] children the Hebrew children the fairy
[28:04] FES praise God he kept his appointment
[28:08] with me on the death
[28:11] bed he's here tonight wherever two or
[28:15] three are gathered
[28:16] together in my name I'll be in their
[28:21] midst Jesus keeps his appointments
[28:26] always praise the name of our Lord like
[28:29] we at church when we said that when next
[28:33] at 4:30 we are meant to be
[28:37] here he keeps his
[28:39] appointment praise the name of our Lord
[28:42] if we say we are having an overnight on
[28:45] Friday like next week on
[28:48] Friday he keeps his
[28:51] appointment if we say we having Sunday
[28:54] service Jesus keeps his appointment
[28:58] how about
[28:59] us praise the name of our Lord Jesus

[29:04] appointments how about us because he
[29:07] said where two or three are gathered in
[29:09] my I will be there in
[29:13] their so then you take it by faith that
[29:17] indeed the Lord is in our
[29:20] M and now when we know that the Lord is
[29:22] an
[29:24] arm let us not be like those people
[29:28] were just pressing
[29:33] Jesus without any benefit for their
[29:36] life but now this woman of a blood

[34:42] not going in a continuous
[34:44] lamentation you know hard nowadays you
[34:48] know this and this you know this and
[34:49] this walk with Christ and then he
[34:52] changes your
[34:54] Lamentations praise the name of our Lord
[34:56] he was walking
[34:58] but this woman touched him
[35:00] by we also need to touch
[35:03] him he said where two three are gathered
[35:06] in my name I there in the he's not there

[35:15] who is really
[35:17] inactive but he wants you to touch
[35:21] him according to your
[35:23] need praise the name of our Lord so the
[35:26] woman touched him

[35:30] benefit and he has promised
[35:33] us whatever you asking my
[35:36] name if you believe you

[35:43] so when they kept on
[35:45] walking then somebody came and told
[35:48] jaras don't travel the
[35:51] master your daughter is dead what did
[35:55] Jesus tell
[35:57] don't fear she will be made
[36:01] well praise the name of our Lord and
[36:03] that's the comfort that we get from
[36:07] God we are with
[36:09] Him Praise the name of our whenever we
[36:12] are with him that's the comfort that we
[36:15] get from
[36:16] him fear not don't be
[36:19] troubled I'm with you
[36:22] always praise the name of and that
[36:25] should give us courage
[36:28] strength whether things are so
[36:31] bad financially you feel everything is
[36:35] down praise the name of our Lord maybe
[36:38] like
[36:39] Farmers some of them just
[36:42] planted and now the sunshine is too
[36:45] much until you find that the Harvest
[36:47] expectation is not
[36:50] there what do you do fear not praise the
[36:54] name of all your animals maybe are sick
[36:58] all your chicken may be all your
[37:01] businesses are
[37:02] collapsing all the taxes have risen up
[37:05] and they making you going to close
[37:07] down says fear
[37:10] not praise the name of our Lord you just
[37:13] need to be
[37:15] encouraged when you know he is with
[37:18] me then you draw strength from
[37:21] him when Abraham was an old
[37:24] man God said El
[37:29] imagine God telling an old man like
[37:33] Abraham that I'm the breasted
[37:36] God come and N from my
[37:39] breast and then brother Bram says with
[37:42] draw strength from the
[37:45] breast so was telling Abraham and old
[37:48] man that I'm still your
[37:51] father come and take milk from
[37:54] me and the strength we get from God
[37:59] from his
[38:01] promises praise the name of the Lord so
[38:03] what is your
[38:05] condition look at the promise that God
[38:08] has and that's why you grow your
[38:11] strength he has
[38:13] promised praise the name of our Lord so
[38:15] we just need to see that when we are
[38:18] walking with
[38:19] Jesus we draw strength from him with
[38:23] draw healing from him with draw comfort
[38:26] from him
[38:28] we draw
[38:30] Comfort peace and all that we have need
[38:33] of praise the name of now when we are
[38:38] walking with
[38:39] Christ we need to acknowledge his
[38:42] presence with
[38:44] us praise the name of our otherwise you
[38:47] be like and his
[38:50] friend who never knew that he was
[38:52] working
[38:54] with praise the name of our Lord we need
[38:56] to knowledge his
[38:59] presence we need to worship him we need
[39:03] to praise him we need to meditate upon
[39:06] his wife we need to think about
[39:09] him praise the name of our Lord and then
[39:12] we s another
[39:14] example when the parents the family of
[39:17] Jesus Christ when they walked with him
[39:21] when you read in Luke 2: 41 to verse 48
[39:28] you may not read there praise the name
[39:30] of they walked with Jesus as a family
[39:35] and then they went to the
[39:37] temple and when they were
[39:40] there they thought Jesus was with them
[39:44] so they walked
[39:46] back and they left Jesus at the
[39:50] temple so just only walking with
[39:54] them you may forget him but you need him
[39:58] to be inside of
[40:01] you praise the name of Lord Peter was
[40:04] with him but he denied
[40:07] him Judas was with him but he betrayed
[40:11] him but yet he has
[40:13] promised praise the name of our Lord
[40:16] that I will dwell in
[40:19] you praise the name of our I will be in
[40:24] you in John chapter 14
[40:29] praise the name of our Lord John 14
[40:32] verse
[40:36] 16 and I will pray the father and he
[40:39] shall give you another comforter that he
[40:42] may abide with you
[40:50] forever the spirit of Truth whom the
[40:53] world cannot receive because it sees him
[40:56] not neither knows him but you know him
[40:59] for he dwells with you and shall be in
[41:15] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[41:18] will come to
[41:23] you praise the name of our Lord so we
[41:26] have a promise
[41:28] that he will come and dwell in
[41:31] us he comes and sits in your
[41:35] life so you allow him to be the Lord of
[41:38] your
[41:40] life you allow him to lle your
[41:43] life he comes and resides inside of
[41:46] you now when Christ resides inside of
[41:50] you you cannot forget him like
[41:54] Mary when Christ is inside of you
[41:57] you cannot deny him like
[41:59] Peter when Christ is inside of you you
[42:03] cannot betray him like
[42:06] Jud but he always present in
[42:10] you in any time of trouble he will
[42:14] always prove his presence in your
[42:16] life praise the name of our Lord and
[42:19] this is what the Lord encouraged
[42:21] us that when they put you before
[42:25] Cel and then they start asking you he
[42:29] said don't think what you're going to
[42:34] say that very hour when they are putting
[42:37] a challenge to
[42:39] you the spirit of God will come and use
[42:43] you to speak the
[42:45] right how does that come because he
[42:49] right inside of you it's not you but
[42:53] it's God that dwells in you
[42:57] does it praise the name of the Lord so
[43:00] we need to have a personal
[43:03] relationship a
[43:05] relationship where we are certain that
[43:08] the Lord dwells in
[43:11] me the Lord lives in my
[43:14] life it's no longer I but it is Christ
[43:18] that lives
[43:19] in that should always be our
[43:22] testimony if you have met him as he
[43:26] resided inside of you praise the name of
[43:30] and that should be
[43:31] always just walking with him is not
[43:35] enough but you need to be with him right
[43:39] inside of you so wherever you go he's
[43:42] right inside of you praise the name of
[43:45] our Lord and that makes a lot of
[43:48] sense that will fight your
[43:51] battles he will fight all your battle
[43:55] praise the name of our Lord he will take
[43:57] over all your
[43:58] challenges he will help you in every
[44:01] trouble he will give you
[44:04] comfort he will direct you praise the
[44:07] name of our Lord at every time that the
[44:10] devil brings a
[44:13] challenge the Lord is always
[44:16] there praise the name of our Lord to
[44:18] help you overcome the challenge that you
[44:20] are
[44:23] with praise the name of our Lord in MTH
[44:26] 28
[44:28] and then verse
[44:33] 20 the scripture
[44:35] says teaching them to observe all things
[44:39] whatsoever have commanded you and lo I
[44:41] Am With You Always even un the end of
[44:44] the world
[44:49] Amen Matthew 28 ver
[45:09] amen so he says I'm always with
[45:13] you so whatever St you going
[45:17] through don't allow the devil to tell
[45:20] you for you Lord the Lord has left
[45:23] you praise the name of our Lord don't
[45:26] allow
[45:28] to make as if you are
[45:32] lonely praise the name of but just know
[45:35] that he's here with
[45:37] me and then you have fellowship
[45:41] with praise the name of whatever
[45:43] challenge that comes in life you must
[45:47] have that
[45:48] certainty that the Lord knows what I'm
[45:51] going and the Lord is interested in my
[45:55] welfare the is interested in my good
[45:58] health the Lord is interested in my
[46:01] Financial
[46:02] Health the Lord is interested in my
[46:05] family health or family
[46:08] wellbeing and then you take it by
[46:10] Faith Lord this is the promise
[46:13] your Lord this is what you've promised
[46:16] us come and take charge over my life
[46:19] come and direct my
[46:21] life praise the name of our Lord we just
[46:24] need to be certain of the Lord
[46:27] and when we know we are walking with him
[46:29] we know he's inside of us then ask what
[46:33] you
[46:33] will praise the name of our Lord and
[46:36] then you can bring it to the Lord and
[46:39] say Lord this is my
[46:41] name Lord this is my
[46:43] requ Lord I need you praise the name of
[46:47] our Lord acknowledge
[46:50] Him Praise the name of our Lord you know

[46:56] of our Lord
[46:57] accept him Lord take over all my
[47:01] problems take over all my needs take
[47:04] over everything that I am look at that
[47:07] woman with
[47:09] BL 12 years spent all her
[47:14] living and then she said if I can touch
[47:17] the H of his
[47:18] gun if we can also touch the H of his
[47:22] G praise the name of our Lord going in
[47:26] Hebrews chapter 4
[47:28] and then verse
[47:31] 14 praise the name of our
[47:36] Lord the Bible says seeing then that we
[47:40] have a great high priest that is passed
[47:43] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[47:46] let us hold F our profession
[48:00] praise the name of the Lord say let us
[48:02] hold our
[48:06] confession so what is your
[48:10] confession praise the name of the Lord
[48:13] and your
[48:14] confession should not be your
[48:17] failure your confession should not be

[48:47] they against you just say I am more
[48:51] than that's your confession your

[49:00] exams I don't know if I'm going to pass
[49:04] what should be your confession I am
[49:06] going to pass praise the name of so you
[49:10] don't confess negative
[49:13] things Christ is not there to intered

[49:21] failures but is there to intercede for
[49:23] your success
