honor to your holy names speak to us according to your Divine Purpose and directing us and Lord you may help us to walk in your paste the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know amen Amina agreed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to turn to Genesis chapter 16. we're reading from verse 1 to verse 6. so the Bible says now Sarai Abraham's wife bear him no children and she had an handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar foreign behold now the Lord has restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abraham hack into the voice of Sarah Salah mukama and this is made the Egyptian after Abraham had drilled train years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife and he went in unto her and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes Abraham my wrong be upon thee I have given my maid into thy person and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the Lord judged between me and thee now is all right Behold thy maid is in thy hand do unto as it pleases and when Sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face praise the name of the Lord I just want to take less than one hour then our time has gone I want to preach on handling challenges in your marriage handling challenges in your marriage is the name of our Lord so we see a very interesting story of Abraham and Sarah Ibrahim you know they had spent many years without any charge and then we need also to know that challenges do exist in every marriage you know like in this marriage of Abraham and Sarah they were not giving birth to children they were barrenness and then you find that in some other marriages maybe their problem is lack of finances they need some marriages they don't have a home where they call home they are just all the time afraid praise the name of our Lord like there is a brother get your Uganda you know he was living in somebody's house and then now it reached a time after a number of years the owners of the house sold it and now this brother was stuck Oregon don't know and the people who bought him told him leave the house when they say he's not leaving the house they started planting things near the house so that the animals of this brother can eat those things and they try to push him out and then they started trying to obstruct his interests so to them that was a big Challenge and then in some areas you find that you have bad neighborhoods every time they are against you you see and then in some areas you know you have you find families where they have poorly raised their children you know so when you talk about children to them it is a shame foreign you know it's challenges still so Moses then others abandoned you find that they are relatives we are not in Ganda you know maybe the family of their wife or the family of the husband the relatives are so problematic you know they have no respect all the time they are looking for issues against their their family those are also issues again you get again in another family suspicion is always very hard the husband thinks when the wife is always with another man um when the wife also thinks when the man is always also with another woman the person is watching over under suspicious challenges then again you get in another home the problem of sickness more places of work become a problem for a marriage or if not that's not the issue one of the workers now it becomes a problem are you going to leave work because of saving your marriage what are you going to do problems everywhere and then there are also other challenges which are nowadays common while it works you find that maybe the husband is working in Kampala and maybe the wife is working in foreign foreign and then verse 19. the Canada praise the name of our Lord say you're welcome he was preaching but today a new church there America will happen so in first John chapter 3 verse 19. the Bible says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him first John chapter 3 and then verse 19. coutinho could take goodness okay for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knows all things foreign beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God about that and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his side and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment foreign foreign it is and now when Abraham did so and the hunger is so that she has she was she was pregnant then she immediately started despising Sarah masala now and you see that sometimes we go through life challenges yes it was a challenge we also have different challenges in our lives we have different challenges in our marriage different challenges at our homes and then when you have that challenge how do you handle that challenge so that by Abraham going to Hagar one will be a solution but it became a worse problems she created a serious problems you know sometimes we think that he needed this you know yet that thing may not be necessary but then your mind is fixed on that thing we see that even when he when he foreign when we got to Genesis chapter 15. praise the name of our Lord in Genesis chapter 15 and then verse 1. the Bible says in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thy shield and thy exceeding great rewards and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me saying I go childless and the steward of my house is this elieza of Damascus is and that Brahm said behold to me though has given no seed and law one born in my house is my hair is and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou are able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be named [Music] and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness you know when we read the promises of God what he has given unto us are we patient can we wait on the Lord concerning that issue oh you know you try to devise a way how to handle this issue how to handle the other issues how to handle the other issues we see that even Isaac and Rebecca were also buried let us go to Genesis chapter 25. and then we read in the verse 19. and these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begat Isaac is and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethel the Syrian of padaram the sister of Laban the syrians and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was interested of him and Rebecca his wife conceived is now when we read in verse 26 the Bible says and after that came his brother out and his hand took a hold on Esau's Hill and his name was called Jacob and Isaac Isaac was three score years old when she bear them [Music] so Isaac married when he was 40 years not giving birth 20 years Rebecca was barren and then now Isaac the Bible says and treated the Lord for the condition of his wife and the Bible says when Isaac entreated of the Lord instead of him many many conceived and now that's how we should also be handling our challenges praise the name of our Lord whatever challenge you have at home bring it to the Lord in prayer whatever situation it may be a problem of barrenness bring it to the Lord in prayer like now Isaac he brought the issue of barrenness to God and say Lord praise the name of our Lord you blessed marriage and then you said be fruitful and multiply and here we are you alone can bless the womb of my wife and then the Lord opened the womb of Rebecca you may be having a challenge of the finances you you don't have means to handle the challenges you have at home bring it to the Lord in prayer and seek the will of God lord what will I do you said you would Bless The Works of my heart and this is what I'm doing Lord can you bless the work of my heart may you multiply the increase praise the name of our Lord and then you find that issues like there was a widow whose husband was one of the prophets and then they were taking the sons into bondage because they were demanding a lot of money and then that woman went and cried to the prophet and he cried the Prophet Elijah your servant this one of the son of the Prophet when he died let's find out foreign what do you do do you run away from your home now if you have built a house there will you say it and don't buy another one what are you going to do praise the name of our Lord bring it to the Lord and then if it is you need to show them the love of God not to react the way they react to you but then you see how you show them the love of God you express them the love of God waiting on the Lord you know the Bible tells us when we got Philippians chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord Philippians chapter four Filipina and then we start reading from verse 4. the Bible says rejoice in the end and again as soon let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand because be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto the Lord the Bible says be careful for nothing so whatever issue you have whatever challenge together remember in the midst of your business schedule plan to pray together plan to fast together praise the name of our Lord but you see what the devil has done you find that the husband is busy the wife is busy and everybody has their programs and the programs are not compatible oh now like this now all the children are still coming back oh now I'm busy marking scripts it's almost raining then ah you know I need to buy some stuff and put in the store I'm aiming at getting more profit at this time and then the devil keeps on taking a hold of the family he puts the differences there praise the name of our Lord and then you find that there is no peace at home everybody may be suspicious everybody is busy but then the Bible is you know let us be careful for nothing but let us bring every request ago let us be made them known to the Lord and you know as a family he said we are two or three are gathered in my name and as a husband what a great opportunity for the Lord to come in your immediately if you can gather in his name it's a great opportunity as a family to pray together as a family to present your request to God together as a family to fast together and say Lord this is the issue that we have no this is the problem [Music] we need to learn how to present all our issues and say Lord we are overwhelmed with this circumstance [Applause] that trouble that you have about praise the name of our Lord allow the Lord to take over it because I'm saying and say Lord take over this issue whatever challenge praise the name of our Lord and then now here there is in this message question and answers something has settled over me that I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in white sand okay it was getting dark I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now I'm as one groping in darkness my son and wife were included in my dreams now they are also in darkness we are in Desperate we are in desperation I believe God will show you what what is in our hearts now if we are wrong or sinning places we want to be right and then Brett brownham answers I don't know the lady but I just feel if you are here already praise the name of our Lord you know this sister dreamed that she was lost in white science and then Darkness was coming and then she dreamed that her son and the the his wife they were also involved in that same trouble and so many times the devil can bring an issue and then it takes away your peace praise the name of Allah and then your brother Brandon sees their conditions and then interprets for them and then he says here is your trouble you have left you have let something happen to you that's made you nervous why do because being in white sense represents Purity and righteousness and you are just letting Satan put one over on you show you your your dream proved that there is nothing wrong you are only navias and by doing this and thinking this you are making the rest of your family navias stop doing it claim your god-given right your dream proves by the interpretation that you are in white sun everything is all right it's you yourself and you let one member your family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next man and the first thing you are all fussing and going on where are you and one member of the family gets this kind of upset [Music] about something it upsets the others the first thing you know whole family is upset it is then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with him so every one of them family tried to do that try each one of your children to help your papa try to help Papa and Mama try to help your children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you are Christians you are born of the spirit you are the salt of the earth you have God given right and the Bible says if there be any praise don't think about the wrong thing and you see the devil just knows how to get a hold of our stations you know he can come and bring some thought which is not right and then you go with that imagination and something you find that your peace has been taken you find that your Liberties like now this family foreign to think about something wrong like I remember it was Wednesday a big hump ing up and then now there is a man who came behind and it was night somebody came and parked behind just a short distance from where we had passed and now when I was starting was going back and then there was a man passing on the side and then he said hey you extended behind then I started saying this man has something wrong seriously why would you rejoicing somebody getting a problem why would you rejoice in something doing something wrong but sometimes this is what the devil puts upon us you start rejoicing over your neighbor maybe for their friends I think that was good and then it becomes once into his husband and wife rejoicing over the others failure husband is happy because the wife has been demoted why would you rejoice over such a thing or even maybe the husband rejoicing when the wife gets an accident accident now all those mention which brag about are going to stop why would you read something that right and so you see we need not rejoicing things that are wrong but see the Bible is telling us when we got Philippians chapter four and then we read in verse 7. and the peace of God which passes all understandings through Christ Jesus we remember Christ yes sir prayer is the name of God you know our Lord told us my peace I give you not as the world but my peace I give you and the inner person without peace they are always proud of the people suspicious because they don't have peace when we present our request unto the Lord when we present our challenges Lord we have this issue then the peace of God will come down supposing saying God Sarah was patient with Abraham and not tell Abraham no you go with this man yeah because even Rebecca had they made but he didn't tell either go with my mind praise the name of us so then you find that there are solutions we seek foreign and then the Bible says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever thinks are honest whatsoever things are just whatever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatever thinks of good report everything if they have been in a virtue and if they are be any praise think on this thing in your challenges think about the goodness talk about the goodness talk about what the Lord has done and tell the Lord what you desire you know what I believe that I believe you are going to trust me I believe you're going to take us through this because I believe you're going to do this think about good things talk about good things foreign when you stay in that kind of place think positive praise the name of our Lord think about the goodness of the Lord think about you know the things that will bring the name of the Lord to be exalted praise the name and now as a husband you need to love one another regardless of your differences praise the name of our Lord the same thing with the word but then you see that there are some scenarios where the husband is suspicious of the wife and their wife is suspicious of the house and you can never have peace in that kind of environment so then you need to sit down and talk over it what are your fears praise the name of us not putting spies against one another praise the name of Allah you know there are some homes if the husband is not around he makes you he gets his relative from the village husband works far away I have my young what maybe they can help you there yeah and to make it worse some of them go to telephone companies to get the print out of the phones check who do you communicate but one is not confident over another [Music] crazy you know you need to learn how to be supportive of each other and then you need to see that your heart are open with one another not hiding this not hiding this praise the name but supportive of one another praise the name of us now let us go to First Peter chapter three foreign the scripture says likewise the husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heard together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered um then he says finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one over another love as Brethren be pitfull be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for writing but controller wise blessing knowing that you are there and to call that you should inherit a blessing women for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his stand from Evil and his lips that they speak no guy is let him rescue evil and do good let him seek peace and stew it praise the name of Allah and then he continues to say for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and these ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil away amen amen now the Bible is telling us love one another don't render evil for evil because he has done me this I'm also going to do this you're not solving anything you are instead magnifying the problem but if he has done this if she has done this forgive her tell them about maybe the thing you did hurt me and then you pray for one another praise the name of Allah and then the Bible says it's too evil you know you ask you it you hate it and then you see that you seek to do good praise the name of Allah at least you should not be responsible for the challenge at home but if you are it is coming out of you then say please forgive me I didn't know that this was what it was going to do please forgive me confess to one another please this is my weakness stand with me and then the Bible says seek peace and when you seek the peace foreign foreign then Joseph her husband being a just man was not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared down to him in a dream saying Joseph the son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy ghosts now Joseph he didn't know what was happening but then he says Mary's stomach is growing big and he was wondering foreign but then the Bible says Joseph never wanted to make Mary a public example my jersey looked like Mary had betrayed him but he because he loved the house he sought her protection and that should be the same thing we should have with our husband or wife what Grace are you giving them what support are you giving them crucify him maybe in the neighborhood among the relatives in the village a place Joseph never wanted to marry to go through such a kind of thing so he determined to put her away privately silence and then you will see some people when they have a difference everybody they want everybody to know about that difference that should not be so as a home keep the respect and the the kind of hone of your home because if you now come and start speaking out things you do at your home you are shaming yourself [Applause] then you have confidence before God foreign he says okay one was asking him a question how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her [Music] and oh stay with the word then he says and then she said why don't you practice what you preach or believe then he jumps I'm jumping here then he says paragraph 116. he said now stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you praise the name of us and that's what we are responsible for let your husband see Jesus regardless of his failures regardless of his mistake Let Your Children See Jesus and you know that will give you strength When you pray to God when you are claiming them Lord didn't live on my wife Lord deliver my children because the Bible has told us that the Lord is the Lord he has the prayers of those that are righteous so you have the confidence that when you pray the Lord is hearing praise the name of us so he says Let Them See Jesus and then he said I give a little illustration this morning about a person one time this little woman had received the Holy Ghost she was a very strictly person really she had a hard life and her husband was alcoholic so she kept on um you want to go to church but now everything he went down to the salon down you know in certain called city called Old Brown Derby so they hang out there with all the time then he says so hanging around there the first thing you know one time one night came up a question about church and Christians one of the old drunks setting they are saying there ain't no such a thing as a Christian and there is no such a thing oh this bunch of Hypocrites said you see them out there smoking doing the same thing that we do call themselves Christians there is no such a thing then this one drank this this man who was the husband that sister was born again raised up and said just a minute there is it it is my wife now you can imagine close up he was watching it all the time I think we can jump there and so now these people are great people are right that let us go home and pretend that we are too drunk so this husband goes with other drunkards and then they come and they do funny things to prove whether this woman is a Christian she does this they throw it away she never lost her peace of mind she was able to bear with it and then in paragraph 120. It's a whole nonsense you know that I didn't want them that way in the first place they went out there but I'm sat down and act like they was driving they had her there singing real love voice but Jesus bear the cross alone yes she was going through a trial maybe it could be your trial are you going to give up are you going to say no no no I'm no longer handling this or you are going to go through the way of the Lord this despised then he says one drunk looked at the other one she's a Christian because and then live the life of Jesus Christ foreign [Music] foreign foreign and I want to read from verse 10. the Bible says and the people ask him saying what shall we do then [Music] what shall we do and big content with your wages and see that you all reserve the peace is thanking the lord thanking the Lord for your husband thanking the Lord for your wife thanking the Lord for your children thanking the Lord for all that he has done thanking God for your home thanking God for your place and then you will see these challenges keep on disappearing one by one you thought this was a big issue God moves it away we just need to learn how to depend upon the Lord may God bless you amen I mean there's that song that says us that they are parties for the water if we can get it and then we can pray we can stand up sing it together and then we can each of us friends praise the name of our Lord [Music] you are alone [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] desires [Music] I want you [Music]
