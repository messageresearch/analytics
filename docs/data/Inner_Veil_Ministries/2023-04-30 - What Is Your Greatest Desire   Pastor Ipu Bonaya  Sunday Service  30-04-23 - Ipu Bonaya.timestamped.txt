[45:22] our brother comes from California
[45:26] that's where he passed as a church

[45:59] okay

[46:07] I greet you all in the precious name of
[46:10] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[46:14] I trust

[46:21] I must confess that this is the first
[46:24] time
[46:27] Crossing Borders
[46:30] amen moving from one country to another
[46:33] currency I
[46:37] kind of come from the coastal region of
[46:40] Kenya where you're more more
[46:44] in my home place
[46:50] but the greatest past part of my life
[46:56] has been in California
[46:59] where all my children were born
[47:02] and that's the place that
[47:11] well I'm not a renowned preacher to
[47:14] remove
[47:15] because there are very few churches one
[47:18] that I have preached outside of course
[47:24] but certainly let me say right that it
[47:27] is always a delight
[47:29] to meet together with
[47:32] the children of God
[47:36] the purchase of God
[47:39] because we all have
[47:42] one thing in common
[47:46] praise the Lord and it is that faith
[47:50] that keeps us together
[47:52] and we are trusted
[47:58] inspiration

[1:40:41] believe if what we could desire
[1:40:43] Hallelujah
[1:40:53] Hallelujah because if he has to restore
[1:40:57] only the word can restore
[1:41:03] and here is
[1:41:10] the way
[1:41:12] foreign
[1:41:29] quiet him
[1:41:38] silica
[1:41:39] Hallelujah then a spirit will come upon
[1:41:43] him
[1:41:44] he asks which is that spirit said it
[1:41:48] will be Christ
[1:41:49] and you only speak the ABC people
[1:41:55] he's just a man but when he holds the
[1:41:58] man
[1:42:00] that disease recognize the gift and that
[1:42:04] disease through the stretched hand of
[1:42:07] God
[1:42:08] moves
[1:42:12] if you want to leave your disease
[1:42:16] do you believe that God touches
[1:42:20] the hand is normal
[1:42:24] now that's what happened during the time
[1:42:26] of Moses
[1:42:31] when God come
[1:42:34] into Moses
[1:42:35] give him the gifts
[1:42:39] foreign
[1:43:34] hand of God
[1:43:38] when it is brought back
[1:43:40] it is something famous
[1:43:43] because
[1:43:45] nothing to do with Moses
[1:44:03] in order for him to do that your
[1:44:06] pleasure he has to leave the entirety of
[1:44:08] redemption
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:14] that will be the seventh age
[1:44:21] foreign
[1:44:51] foreign
[1:45:03] so all that he worked
[1:45:06] for six ages
[1:45:16] so that his message
[1:45:25] it has nothing to do
[1:45:28] with this mind it is a working of God
[1:45:34] a gift of God
[1:45:42] may receive
[1:45:45] d
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:49] cause gifts
[1:45:55] I see a woman
[1:45:59] amen maybe in this age it might be
[1:46:04] different
[1:46:05] I don't know today Hallelujah
[1:46:08] this man coming with many visitors
[1:46:14] the normal woman
[1:46:16] would say
[1:46:18] don't you know I also get tired
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] but to this woman
[1:46:26] it was a delight the reason when brother
[1:46:30] Branham
[1:46:30] came with his friends
[1:46:33] to him
[1:46:36] that's all that he desires
[1:46:47] home
[1:46:50] he started speaking of something that
[1:46:54] God had done
[1:46:57] and this woman it was not a work of that
[1:47:01] day
[1:47:02] he always was delighting herself with
[1:47:08] the word
[1:47:10] he loved that man you loved that game
[1:47:13] everything
[1:47:24] to me
[1:47:26] so when he gave the testimony
[1:47:33] that Eternal thought
[1:47:36] that greatest
[1:47:47] if her Delight will be for the Lord
[1:47:53] you can never understand
[1:47:56] the things of God until you get a desire
[1:48:02] I'm so happy to hear my pastor friend
[1:48:06] tell you as I am preaching
[1:48:10] go back and read the message the bridge
[1:48:14] because you have to be in the same
[1:48:16] continuity
[1:48:18] you have to be delighting with the same
[1:48:21] things
[1:48:22] all that when Christ prays to Hallelujah
[1:48:26] anointing comes on the same time
[1:48:36] the things
[1:48:44] foreign
[1:49:13] foreign
