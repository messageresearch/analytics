[3:41:56] [Music]
[3:41:58] you I love him too
[3:42:01] much he is a pastor and my
[3:42:05] uncle I tell you the fact my mom is
[3:42:11] a he's my
[3:42:13] uncle and my mothers are here God bless
[3:42:17] you too
[3:42:22] much God bless
[3:42:24] you you may be
[3:42:27] seated have you been blessed in the
[3:42:32] service
[3:42:34] amen God bless you for taking your time
[3:42:38] to be
[3:42:39] here you see one time when Thomas was
[3:42:42] not around
[3:42:45] when Jesus came he missed the
[3:42:49] Revelation so let us always be available
[3:42:52] when the church doors are
[3:42:55] open the brother told us this
[3:42:59] message is God
[3:43:02] himself and this
[3:43:04] message was God the
[3:43:08] omnipotent to come down and meet with
[3:43:12] another omnipotent
[3:43:17] amen at the seventh
[3:43:21] Junction because we've had seven
[3:43:25] Junctions by you know different men God
[3:43:28] has
[3:43:29] used but on the
[3:43:32] seventh amen it was Malachi 4 so at the
[3:43:37] seventh
[3:43:38] Junction God and man became one and
[3:43:43] that's what Malachi demonstrated in his
[3:43:47] ministry he spoke things in
[3:43:50] existence the omnipotent
[3:43:53] power natural
[3:43:55] man had become one so that the
[3:44:00] maturity of this
[3:44:03] age amen will be God becoming one with
[3:44:08] the entire
[3:44:10] bride amen so he still the omnipotent
[3:44:15] and you are
[3:44:17] Theon and God coming down to join with
[3:44:21] the bride in the BM of the Holy Ghost at
[3:44:26] this time all things are
[3:44:31] possible at this time all things are
[3:44:35] possible that's why we have Look Away to
[3:44:39] Jesus amen and the third pool is here at
[3:44:44] the same point
[3:44:46] so when the
[3:44:48] omot met with Brother
[3:44:51] Bram all things were
[3:44:54] possible because he gave him the same
[3:44:57] anointing the same power the same
[3:45:01] Miracles the same signs and
[3:45:04] wonders and I believe that the same
[3:45:07] anointing and power and
[3:45:10] authority is now manifesting through the
[3:45:15] brother was laboring to tell
[3:45:17] you that brother Bram didn't go home
[3:45:21] with that
[3:45:22] anointing he left it back and that's our
[3:45:27] inheritance God bless you thank you for
[3:45:30] being here brother
[3:45:34] Moses do you love him amen so you just
[3:45:39] believe if you stood here you came
[3:45:43] because you you had a desire
[3:45:46] and let's just
[3:45:48] believe that this
[3:45:50] desire will be
[3:45:52] manifested as an answer to
[3:45:56] prayer amen so on our chat
[3:46:01] room I'm going to send you some
[3:46:05] quotes on that
[3:46:08] omnipotent meeting
[3:46:11] with one day after another
[3:46:15] gives us something to feed
[3:46:17] on and you happy that's another thing we
[3:46:21] are going to feed
[3:46:22] on
[3:46:24] realize that when God comes into Union
[3:46:28] with
[3:46:29] you god makes you
[3:46:33] anent before all
[3:46:36] situations when that one
[3:46:38] happens all things are possible God
