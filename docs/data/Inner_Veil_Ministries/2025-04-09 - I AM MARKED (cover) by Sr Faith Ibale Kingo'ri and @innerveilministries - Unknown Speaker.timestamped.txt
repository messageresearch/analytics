[0:04] I have lost my
[0:08] [Music]
[0:12] reputation since I turned my back on
[0:19] sin.
[0:23] had a lot of
[0:27] friends. Went
[0:31] froing since I let my
[0:37] savior
[0:39] [Music]
[0:41] in. Now they pass me by unknown.
[0:50] [Music]
[0:52] And they
[0:55] once a
[0:58] [Music]
[1:00] smile. Now they
[1:03] say I'm
[1:06] very
[1:10] foolish. And they
[1:12] say I'm out your high.
[1:19] over time. I'm
[1:23] mad
[1:25] [Music]
[1:29] m
[1:31] just now.
[1:34] Wherever I
[1:39] go, I
[1:42] am
[1:45] [Music]
[1:48] mad. Just what I am.
[1:53] Everyone seems to know.
[1:59] I am
[2:04] still
[2:07] sealed. I am sealed by his
[2:13] [Music]
[2:17] spirit. Oh,
[2:20] glory to
[2:22] God.
[2:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:28] I am his and I know he's
[2:35] [Music]
[2:36] mine. Well, they
[2:39] [Music]
[2:41] say and my
[2:45] talent
[2:47] thrown away.
[2:50] [Music]
[2:52] And they
[2:53] [Applause]
[2:55] cannot
[2:59] understand it. For I had such plans one
[3:07] day.
[3:10] Oh, but I
[3:13] know what I
[3:20] send when I
[3:23] promise. I go through.
[3:29] Oh, and I give I gave
[3:35] power of
[3:39] glory is my singing.
[3:45] [Music]
[3:46] Oh, and I am
[3:50] I am.
[3:58] Oh, I
[4:00] am now
[4:03] wherever I go. I am
[4:15] [Music]
[4:18] Just what I am.
[4:22] Everyone seems to know. And I see.
[4:28] I am. I'm still
[4:32] I'm
[4:39] still by your
[4:42] spirit
[4:45] divine.
[4:48] Glory. Oh, glory to
[4:51] God.
[4:53] Hallelujah. Amen.
[4:57] I am here and I
[5:02] know. Oh, and I am.
[5:06] I am. I'm
[5:09] still
[5:13] [Music]
[5:17] I'm by
[5:20] his
[5:22] divine all glory.
[5:26] Oh, all glory to
[5:29] God.
[5:34] Halleluah. I am his and I know he's
[5:41] mine.
[5:45] I am
[5:46] his and I know
[5:51] he's mine.
[5:53] [Music]
