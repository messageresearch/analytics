[42:08] death may the Lord add
[42:11] blessing to the reading of the word amen
[42:15] will you obey the voice of your mother
[42:18] today let's be
[42:20] seated so we are in our
[42:24] series uh preaching stability
[42:29] and I'm taking the third
[42:32] part the title of the third
[42:36] part is rea the mother of
[42:42] Jacob Rebecca the mother of
[42:47] Jacob now brother Bram speaks so much
[42:51] about church motherhood
[42:57] by pointing at
[43:01] Rome the mother
[43:03] Church to the organizational
[43:07] setup mother of
[43:10] Hots and all Abominations of the
[43:14] Earth but in the kingsman
[43:17] Redeemer he gives us another concept
[43:20] about
[43:21] church in terms of
[43:24] motherhood and let us pull that quote
[43:28] out from the kingsman
[43:31] Redeemer brother Bram says the old
[43:34] church is a mother to the new
[43:39] church when he's talking about the old
[43:42] church he's talking about
[43:46] Israel being the mother of the new
[43:49] church and the new church is the New
[43:52] Testament Gentile
[43:55] church but the mother who
[43:57] here is the
[44:00] Christian the Christian a Believer are
[44:04] you together with me so I spoke about
[44:08] the word made
[44:10] flesh and that's where the foundation of
[44:14] a
[44:15] churches that's the revelation of
[44:19] Christ the church amen I I want to say
[44:24] something here that it must be the word
[44:28] made
[44:30] flesh upon which the church is
[44:34] built now and I want to say this that it
[44:39] was an individual
[44:42] Revelation upon which Christ builds his
[44:46] church he doesn't build on an
[44:51] organization he builds on
[44:54] you because the Jews
[44:57] God worked with
[44:59] them as a
[45:01] nation they would fall as a
[45:04] nation and then they would be restored
[45:06] as a
[45:07] nation but when it comes to you God is
[45:12] dealing with you
[45:14] person and when he says upon that
[45:18] church I build my I mean upon that
[45:23] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[45:26] gats of hell shall not
[45:28] Prevail he's actually talking about you
[45:31] as an
[45:33] individual because when you see
[45:36] Christ and I see Christ and then we come
[45:40] together we are a church founded on
[45:45] Revelation but by matter of
[45:49] individual being made Word
[45:53] Flesh amen so he says the old church
[45:58] is a mother to the new
[46:00] church the
[46:02] Christian a
[46:04] Believer so now in this form of
[46:09] motherhood God is picking
[46:12] individuals among the
[46:14] Gentiles amen so he says don't go to
[46:18] another
[46:22] [Music]
[46:23] field
[46:25] that's now when it's talking to uh to to
[46:31] uh to
[46:33] Ruth he say stay right in this
[46:38] field and maybe someday you might find
[46:42] Grace with
[46:44] me so when we come to this point here we
[46:48] said that the
[46:50] church that God is speaking
[46:53] about is not your individual local
[46:58] church no the church is speaking about
[47:03] is totally different he's
[47:06] speaking about the invisible
[47:10] body of the Lord Jesus
[47:12] Christ are you together with me so
[47:15] that's why he says don't STG from the
[47:19] word don't stuggle from the
[47:23] blessing don't stuggle from the baptism
[47:28] that made you part of the
[47:31] church are you together with me we shall
[47:34] make it clear as we go so the old
[47:38] church meaning the Old Testament
[47:42] Israel the Old Testament
[47:48] Israel is the mother to the new test
[47:52] church and single out as an individual
[47:56] believer
[47:59] being that
[48:00] church so I wanted to find an
[48:05] angle of emphasizing Church
[48:10] motherhood other than the
[48:19] concept and so I want to draw the
[48:21] concept of motherhood from
[48:25] that that's why I call this service
[48:29] today
[48:31] Rebecca the mother of
[48:34] Jacob so God commits similar sacred
[48:38] virtues to the
[48:42] woman that is spiritually commits to the
[48:46] church the
[48:49] VES the sacred
[48:51] virtues that he places to the church
[48:55] spiritually he desires to see them in a
[48:58] woman
[49:00] natur amen so in the message in Vis
[49:05] Union brother Bram says what a sacred
[49:11] trust what a responsibility to a
[49:17] woman now see why she's a type of the
[49:21] church which has the same responsibility
[49:28] as a woman has a responsibility to her
[49:34] motherhood or to have
[49:36] [Music]
[49:38] virtues to her
[49:40] husband the church has a sacred
[49:45] responsibility to
[49:46] prayer and to the word and to Christ
[49:51] just the same as the woman
[49:53] have a woman has a sa Trust
[49:58] are you together with me now they are
[50:03] natural but the church the same trust is
[50:09] spiritual so that the woman could be a
[50:13] natural
[50:14] type of the
[50:17] type of the I mean of of the church so
[50:22] and brother Bram says I'm speaking to
[50:25] her
[50:30] character
[50:36] around not letting every
[50:39] man amen so I want to repeat what
[50:44] brother Bram
[50:45] says I speaking to her
[50:50] conduct her character around
[50:55] men not allowing every
[50:58] man you know a sister shouldn't allow
[51:02] every man around
[51:04] her because she has to
[51:08] protect that sacred
[51:11] motherhood which God gave her she
[51:15] doesn't open
[51:17] herself for every man that's why
[51:21] Rome is the mother of harot and
[51:25] Abominations of the
[51:28] she opened
[51:30] up the word
[51:32] L it means god and the word
[51:37] sh means the
[51:40] breath so God is
[51:44] El in a
[51:46] sense like the weak and the need
[51:51] child would go to the mother and nurse
[51:55] for life
[51:59] El Abraham and sarahah were n on that
[52:05] attribute of
[52:09] el and they became young
[52:12] again and then brought forth
[52:15] life now I do not know how old you
[52:20] feel I don't know how spent you
[52:24] feel how spent
[52:28] you know many times the enemy tells you
[52:31] Z of your Christian
[52:34] Life and yet you feel
[52:37] weak that's when you
[52:40] need hallelujah hallelujah that's when
[52:42] you need to come and on the
[52:47] gifts that God has put in the
[52:50] church hallelujah hallelujah the church
[52:52] is for the
[52:54] weak let the weak say am strong
[52:57] and let them take a step
[53:02] back and be able
[53:04] to on the gift that the Holy Ghost puts
[53:09] in the
[53:10] church oh
[53:12] Hallelujah rea the mother of Jacob it
[53:17] doesn't matter how weak Jacob
[53:24] is ration
[53:27] he said by the side of his
[53:29] mother Hallelujah and the mother
[53:33] said my
[53:35] wife can you imagine now when the Holy
[53:39] Ghost comes in the church and uses the
[53:42] GI to speak
[53:45] [Music]
[53:47] to in
[53:49] is hallelujah hallelujah and Jacob takes
[53:54] everyone but the Holy Ghost
[53:57] speaks by the
[53:58] five
[54:00] hallall yes sir the church is
[54:04] here
[54:06] instruct
[54:07] Jacob Divine approach to
[54:11] [Music]
[54:13] God are you together with yeah we need
[54:16] to be
[54:18] guided Rebecca was
[54:20] there Rea knew the position of Jacob
[54:26] amen that position is not
[54:30] for praise God yes sir and God has given
[54:36] us the church amen where we can exercise
[54:40] our positions in
[54:42] [Music]
[54:46] Christ we are preaching
[54:50] stability Rebecca Rea Jacob's mother
[54:56] Hallelujah for one by one Spirit we are
[55:00] all baptized into one
[55:02] body and become partakers of The Same
[55:07] Spirit that's in the blood
[55:10] cell the church is wrapped into the
[55:14] blood
[55:16] cell of the life of Jesus
[55:19] Christ and he lives in his
[55:22] church through the blood of his
[55:25] sacrifice
[55:27] so The Church on the
[55:30] Rock
[55:32] therefore you know has been
[55:35] given the benefits of
[55:39] Revelation when you get the
[55:42] Revelation when Christ reveals himself
[55:45] to
[55:45] you it doesn't remain in your
[55:49] mind because the Revelation I'm talking
[55:52] about is not your understanding of the
[55:55] godhead
[55:58] but when the person of the Lord Jesus
[56:01] Christ has come over to you and changed
[56:05] your
[56:07] name from Jacob to
[56:10] Israel means he has changed your
[56:14] character amen and so what he did he
[56:19] broke the
[56:20] fire amen of Jacob so that the way he
[56:25] walks
[56:27] they reflect the
[56:28] change that God had given
[56:31] him and the people said he's now
[56:35] lame he went back a poor young
[56:40] man but if he has
[56:42] come very rich but what I see is he
[56:47] cannot even
[56:48] walk I wouldn't like riches when I'm a
[56:52] lame man let the people say what they
[56:56] want
[56:58] he used to be very
[57:00] smart but now that is a
[57:02] Believer look at what he looks like he's
[57:06] not enjoying his wealth he doesn't go to
[57:09] this night club anymore let them say
[57:12] what they she used to be a nice lady she
[57:16] was mod but look at the
[57:19] dresses what they
[57:22] comment on you is the testimony of
[57:30] new amen stand with the new
[57:35] revelation let them say what they
[57:38] say but thank God that you are not what
[57:41] you used to be when God gives a
[57:47] revelation it comes with
[57:50] Benefits because that
[57:52] Revelation is life in
[57:55] itself let's go to
[57:57] Matthew
[57:59] 16 and
[58:01] verse let's be
[58:04] humble and God will Lift Us in due
[58:10] time amen
[58:12] amen you see I'm preaching
[58:16] stability and that's what we need in the
[58:19] churches
[58:20] today the churches have got a total
[58:24] understanding of Doctrine
[58:29] but they cannot stand
[58:33] strong why that's what we are
[58:37] addressing and I'll will take maybe this
[58:41] Warrior trying to help the
[58:44] church to find
[58:49] stability Matthew
[58:51] [Music]
[58:52] 1618 and I say also unto thee
[58:57] that thou art
[59:00] Peter and upon this
[59:04] Ro I build my
[59:07] church and the gods of
[59:09] Hell shall not Prevail
[59:13] against Now The
[59:15] Rock was not
[59:18] Peter The Rock was the Revelation that
[59:22] Peter got
[59:27] okay of who the Christ
[59:30] was so Verse
[59:33] 18 is a Church on the
[59:36] Rock holding together the sacred
[59:42] virtue amen and therefore no G of
[59:46] Hell could Prevail against
[59:49] her why because when she gets the
[59:53] revelation
[59:56] of who this Christ
[59:58] is it comes with
[1:00:03] Benefits there's no way you can be a
[1:00:05] Church on the
[1:00:08] Rock unless you hold those sacred
[1:00:13] VES those sacred
[1:00:16] virtues are the life of
[1:00:20] testimony that you have set your foot on
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:24] Rock Amen amen so Sac
[1:00:29] motherhood a
[1:00:32] womb for one
[1:00:37] PLT to the word
[1:00:41] and amen you get the Keys of the
[1:00:46] Kingdom to bind and
[1:00:48] lose meaning the devil cannot stand
[1:00:52] before you you got the keys to buy
[1:01:00] and amen you must know that by breaking
[1:01:05] into the
[1:01:06] revelation of this
[1:01:08] Christ God would release Divine
[1:01:13] authority to bring the kingdom of
[1:01:18] Satan to her
[1:01:20] KN amen are you together with me the
[1:01:24] Devil Comes
[1:01:26] down and kneels
[1:01:28] down to the presence of the
[1:01:32] church because when you got the
[1:01:37] keys that's like Christ
[1:01:41] himself amen first you have the keys to
[1:01:45] the
[1:01:48] kingdom to bind and
[1:01:52] close what's holding you this morning
[1:01:58] you have the right to buy and to
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:05] lose you've got the authority it was
[1:02:08] given to you recognize who
[1:02:13] thou then let's go to John chapter 20
[1:02:17] here and verse
[1:02:21] 21 then said Jesus to them again
[1:02:27] peace be unto
[1:02:29] you as my father sent
[1:02:34] me even so
[1:02:41] you the same way Jesus
[1:02:45] comes he was given the father's
[1:02:49] Authority and Jesus said I also hand my
[1:02:54] authority
[1:02:56] given to me by the
[1:02:59] father to the
[1:03:02] church what Jesus was able to
[1:03:05] do the church is able to
[1:03:08] do where Jesus would
[1:03:11] B the church would buy where Jesus would
[1:03:15] lose the church would lose believest
[1:03:19] thou
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:23] this praise the Lord
[1:03:26] yes sir we are
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:29] commissioned under the same
[1:03:32] Authority and the same
[1:03:34] anointing Amen to buy and even
[1:03:39] open the
[1:03:41] kingdom for the
[1:03:44] people it's not God opening
[1:03:48] anymore the keys were given to the
[1:03:51] church the
[1:03:53] benefits of Revelation
[1:03:58] amen so verse 22
[1:04:01] here and when he had said this he
[1:04:05] breathed on
[1:04:06] them and
[1:04:09] potentially gave them the Holy
[1:04:11] Ghost and he says unto them receive ye
[1:04:16] the Holy
[1:04:18] Ghost now let me explain it like this
[1:04:21] when this Earth was
[1:04:23] created the seeds
[1:04:26] were already in the Earth on
[1:04:30] creation and he only
[1:04:33] said let every kind bring I mean let
[1:04:37] every tree bring forth of its
[1:04:41] SK let every seed bring forth of each
[1:04:46] sky where was the seed in the ground and
[1:04:50] he
[1:04:51] say receive the Holy Ghost potentially
[1:04:56] the Holy Ghost had come upon
[1:04:58] them when they went to the upper room
[1:05:02] that was the manifestation in the
[1:05:04] presence of the Holy Ghost receive ye
[1:05:08] the Holy Ghost as my father said so send
[1:05:13] your now let me say potentially you have
[1:05:17] the Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost but you are just clearing way
[1:05:25] for the Holy Ghost to manifest himself
[1:05:29] in your
[1:05:30] life because it's the holy ghost in your
[1:05:35] justification amen you can't justify
[1:05:39] yourself it's the holy ghost in your
[1:05:42] sanctification you can sanctify yourself
[1:05:46] and finally the Holy Ghost will be made
[1:05:49] manifest let me say again receive you
[1:05:53] the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] amen stand in
[1:05:59] Channel because there is a man who can
[1:06:02] turn on the light and then the
[1:06:05] darkness that tries to crowd the Holy
[1:06:09] Ghost will give way and you bring forth
[1:06:13] the fruits of his
[1:06:15] presence amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:19] receive you the Holy
[1:06:21] Ghost amen and we take out those are
[1:06:25] benefit
[1:06:26] in verse 23 says whoever sins ye
[1:06:37] remit
[1:06:39] brother
[1:06:41] whoever
[1:06:49] youit God
[1:06:51] bless whoever SE did you know
[1:06:56] that you are remitters of
[1:07:00] sin and the people go to the Roman
[1:07:02] Catholic
[1:07:05] priest you know these people are very
[1:07:10] smart they
[1:07:13] know that when you do something
[1:07:17] terrible it haunts you
[1:07:20] forever but they tell you you can never
[1:07:24] be forgiven
[1:07:26] until you've confessed to the to the
[1:07:30] priest and they said the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] comes upon the
[1:07:34] father that whatsoever you confess when
[1:07:38] he Le the confession box when he the
[1:07:40] confession
[1:07:44] box he has
[1:07:48] forgotten so you say you remember that
[1:07:51] bank
[1:07:54] rob which
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:58] I'm the one who had hooded my
[1:08:03] head and I was shooting
[1:08:06] around oh Father
[1:08:09] for we took about 200 million
[1:08:14] shs God forgive you my son
[1:08:18] truth and then he
[1:08:21] hears that you are going away
[1:08:26] son do you remember what you told
[1:08:29] God and your sin was
[1:08:35] forgiven you start going back
[1:08:41] immediately you understand what I
[1:08:44] mean but we can
[1:08:48] genuinely remit people's
[1:08:52] sins how do we do that
[1:08:56] by giving the people the
[1:08:59] word when you the word is the washing
[1:09:06] Waters the blood I mean the word is the
[1:09:11] blood because the
[1:09:14] word was the original blood
[1:09:21] cell amen that was spoken into the womb
[1:09:24] of a virgin
[1:09:27] and brought forth a
[1:09:29] son and when the son went to the
[1:09:32] Cross he was able to
[1:09:36] pour that blood and now his
[1:09:40] life went back in the blood I mean into
[1:09:43] Spirit
[1:09:45] again amen that's where he is and he's
[1:09:49] the word so when the word is spoken
[1:09:53] that's the blood will you remit people's
[1:09:57] sins how will you do it by living the
[1:10:01] life amen and two by preaching the word
[1:10:06] you remit the people
[1:10:08] see amen you were given that
[1:10:12] Authority why don't you
[1:10:15] try listen that don't cover I'm speaking
[1:10:20] about
[1:10:23] Rebecca Jacob's mother
[1:10:26] listen now
[1:10:29] notice the Greater Works was to have the
[1:10:36] power in the church not only to heal the
[1:10:40] Sick by
[1:10:42] prayer cast out Devils by
[1:10:46] prayer but also to impart eternal life
[1:10:50] to
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:52] Believers hallelujah hallelujah but when
[1:10:55] the people
[1:10:57] believe the what they want is to perform
[1:11:02] sence to have power to heal the se but
[1:11:07] the Greater

[1:25:05] 4:11 and
[1:25:08] he you know when he was talking about
[1:25:11] the
[1:25:12] talent he says that he gave his
[1:25:18] talent those talents were not for the
[1:25:21] people that received them
[1:25:26] but the talents of
[1:25:30] approach were given by
[1:25:32] God to the church and to the
[1:25:37] Ephesians Paul is calling them
[1:25:40] gifts ministerial
[1:25:43] gifts amen they are not given it to one
[1:25:47] man and even if you are very
[1:25:50] gifted and you are
[1:25:52] yourself how can you ify
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:58] yourself preach to yourself evangelize
[1:26:01] to
[1:26:02] yourself there is something
[1:26:07] wrong amen amen Ephesians
[1:26:11] 4 and he gave
[1:26:15] some not he gave
[1:26:17] all but in the entire
[1:26:21] church he gave son
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:25] the will help others
[1:26:33] perfect and he gave some
[1:26:36] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:26:40] evangelist and some pastors and
[1:26:44] teachers you could be highly
[1:26:48] gifted but you are not everything
[1:26:56] Jacob needs a
[1:26:59] mother otherwise he will not come to a
[1:27:02] god ordained position in the
[1:27:08] body Jacob needed a mother you need a
[1:27:13] mother you need a
[1:27:17] church if you have understood that say
[1:27:22] amen amen amen
[1:27:24] okay questions and
[1:27:27] answers you say well glory to
[1:27:31] God the Bible say when the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:35] come you don't need any
[1:27:39] teacher he's the teacher
[1:27:41] himself oh brother how can you be so
[1:27:45] little from reading this
[1:27:49] scripture why did the Holy Ghost say
[1:27:52] teachers in the church then
[1:27:57] so what does this mean the Holy Ghost
[1:28:00] being a teacher is because he has given
[1:28:03] you the
[1:28:07] teacher that's how the Holy Ghost is the
[1:28:10] teacher he speaks
[1:28:13] inspiration needed for a season and then
[1:28:17] gives it to the
[1:28:19] people amen so you say I you you say I
[1:28:24] don't have anybody teach
[1:28:28] me the Holy Ghost teaches me it does
[1:28:32] through a
[1:28:34] teacher he said teachers in the
[1:28:38] church he said are all
[1:28:41] teachers are all pastors are all gifts
[1:28:45] of
[1:28:46] healing the ho God set these gifts in
[1:28:51] the
[1:28:51] church he operates them
[1:28:55] and each one of them operates
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:04] orderly are you together with me he says
[1:29:08] they operate
[1:29:11] orderly even a
[1:29:14] pastor will need the gift of an
[1:29:17] apostle gift of a teacher he cannot be
[1:29:21] everything so these gifts
[1:29:24] must have a field to work
[1:29:28] in a church body a people and they must
[1:29:33] these gifts must have restor to the
[1:29:38] faith of
[1:29:43] Malachi so when computers lose their
[1:29:46] normal
[1:29:50] programming I cannot say this in the
[1:29:52] presence of Silas
[1:29:55] and brother Henry and the rest of you
[1:30:08] [Laughter]
[1:30:10] computer you see but you know sometimes
[1:30:16] they lose their programming du to
[1:30:18] viruses
[1:30:24] but when you remit or you you you delete
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:32] virus normally these
[1:30:34] computers are given a restoration
[1:30:38] [Music]
[1:30:42] point you just restore to this default
[1:30:50] Point are you together with me even when
[1:30:54] your
[1:30:56] phone has
[1:30:59] goneway you have got a restor
[1:31:03] point manufacturer restoration
[1:31:08] Point are you together with me so all of
[1:31:13] us in this age we have been given a
[1:31:17] restoration
[1:31:19] point the message of Malachi
[1:31:22] 4 God has sent us a
[1:31:25] prophet that's our restoration
[1:31:29] point every
[1:31:32] question has been brought down to the
[1:31:35] restoration
[1:31:37] Point behold I send you Elijah
[1:31:40] the before the coming of the great and
[1:31:43] rightful
[1:31:45] of and he shall restore the
[1:31:48] hearts of the
[1:31:50] fathers their children and the children
[1:31:54] I mean to their
[1:31:57] fathers he
[1:32:00] Resto amen he rest the apostolic to the
[1:32:06] church he rest the
[1:32:08] church to the life within that
[1:32:12] doctr he brings to the church back to
[1:32:16] the first
[1:32:18] love you together with me we are being
[1:32:22] restor
[1:32:24] amen we go back to the original
[1:32:27] Pentecostal
[1:32:30] Doctrine amen yes sir he says in
[1:32:37] church for in each
[1:32:39] age the church goes
[1:32:45] astray and it's not just the L but the
[1:32:49] CL group
[1:32:55] shepherds are WR as well as
[1:33:00] sheep then God brings
[1:33:03] himself on the
[1:33:06] scene
[1:33:10] as as the chief shepher in the
[1:33:14] ministries of these seven
[1:33:17] men meaning The Messengers to lead these
[1:33:21] people back
[1:33:24] to the truth and abant
[1:33:27] power of that
[1:33:32] truth so this is how God does
[1:33:35] things all the fivefold
[1:33:38] ministers and the
[1:33:41] later are
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:45] reform by the Min of
[1:33:48] Mal Hallelujah the ministry is not this
[1:33:57] no but they are

[1:34:02] Hallelujah and that's what we've been
[1:34:05] doing going to all these other
[1:34:08] brothers don't tell them
[1:34:11] stop but we tell them be

[1:34:19] position and then begin to go
[1:34:22] forward amen

[1:34:50] in with the wild gods
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] amen because the people know what they
[1:35:10] want to
[1:35:12] be they cry and they say man of
[1:35:18] God man of
[1:35:21] God there is death in the p
[1:35:25] are you together don't
[1:35:28] mix keep the word
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:35] pure keep the church
[1:35:38] touch don't throw denomination seed in
[1:35:43] it amen so we are given five
[1:35:47] Ministries these men are gifts to the
[1:35:51] church the men themselves
[1:35:54] are the gift these men here don't make
[1:35:59] themselves but these men ordained of
[1:36:04] God to be what they
[1:36:07] are so the one who fights to get in
[1:36:11] there is not part of it God when he
[1:36:15] calls you he organizes a position for
[1:36:20] you so he has got five offes
[1:36:24] Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and
[1:36:28] teacher and Ephesians
[1:36:31] 42 he tells us
[1:36:34] why he caus this
[1:36:36] men he says for the perfecting of
[1:36:40] the for the work of the
[1:36:43] ministry for the
[1:36:45] Edy of the body of Christ not for
[1:36:49] destroying the
[1:36:51] body but for edifying
[1:36:54] body that whatever we say and
[1:36:57] do must be seen to edify the
[1:37:03] body so as fivefold
[1:37:07] ministers we have three
[1:37:10] Commissions in
[1:37:12] church but
[1:37:14] generally that is to put the church
[1:37:18] together brother Bram in the message
[1:37:22] Faith cometh by here
[1:37:25] he says but that is it
[1:37:30] friends God s some in the
[1:37:34] church to
[1:37:38] dramati some to preach fire
[1:37:43] sermon others to pray for the
[1:37:46] sick but all these gifted
[1:37:50] Brothers they are in the church
[1:37:54] for one purpose that's to unite the
[1:37:57] kingdom of God here on
[1:37:59] Earth the
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:04] Brotherhood that's why we are here to
[1:38:07] put the body
[1:38:10] together so as a minister whatever you
[1:38:14] do let it put the body
[1:38:19] together if there is anything in me
[1:38:23] which tends to destroy the
[1:38:26] body God
[1:38:28] forbid God didn't call us to do
[1:38:31] that any word I
[1:38:34] say which can break the
[1:38:37] body God be
[1:38:39] merciful it can put me on a higher
[1:38:43] level but it will not help
[1:38:46] me because it doesn't help the body
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:54] we are all
[1:38:56] called to keep this body
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:02] together amen amen I know you could come
[1:39:08] yesterday and you are very
[1:39:11] anointed you can preach the roof
[1:39:15] down and then you start saying that one
[1:39:19] has he done more than what I've done for
[1:39:22] us we've been we go there we go there
[1:39:25] where does he go he goes only at one
[1:39:28] place God have
[1:39:31] mercy God have
[1:39:34] mercy we
[1:39:36] need to
[1:39:39] respect the pillars of the
[1:39:43] faith which God has
[1:39:47] used he calls them I'll make you a
[1:39:51] pillar
[1:39:54] in the house of
[1:39:59] God you may not be
[1:40:02] aware but when you break a
[1:40:05] pillar you might bring a lot of
[1:40:10] Destruction I want to say this by the
[1:40:13] grace of God God has made me a
[1:40:16] pillar in the house of the
[1:40:21] Lord you break it you destroy the work
[1:40:25] of
[1:40:29] God every one of us we need to respect
[1:40:34] the
[1:40:37] principles
[1:40:38] so three things the first thing for the
[1:40:42] perfecting of the
[1:40:44] Saints and these Saints here means
[1:40:48] Sanctified
[1:40:50] ones humanly we men in the
[1:40:54] ministry there's nothing we can do other
[1:40:58] than just supplying the
[1:41:01] materials of
[1:41:03] purification amen just like you know it
[1:41:07] was in the days of
[1:41:10] EST you
[1:41:11] know made sure that she uses the
[1:41:14] materials of
[1:41:18] purification the Church of Corinth could
[1:41:21] have been filthy
[1:41:24] Wicked evil they eat things sacrificed
[1:41:28] to Idols but when PO is
[1:41:31] addressing he says called to be
[1:41:36] Saints and they went a long
[1:41:38] distance to bring that
[1:41:41] testimony are you together with me they
[1:41:44] were doing all kinds of silly
[1:41:47] things but in all the entire
[1:41:50] churches that Paul worked with
[1:41:53] there is no church which received
[1:41:56] greater
[1:41:58] Revelations like the Church
[1:42:03] of they received
[1:42:06] Revelations about the change of our
[1:42:09] bodies they received Revelations of Paul
[1:42:12] going beyond
[1:42:14] the they received Revelations about the
[1:42:17] change of our bodies they receive
[1:42:19] Revelations of how the son will give the
[1:42:23] throne back to the
[1:42:26] father there are so many great things in
[1:42:29] that book that will never been revealed
[1:42:32] to
[1:42:34] thees we are not here to call judgment
[1:42:38] upon you because you are still
[1:42:40] young and you are moving in a way that's
[1:42:44] not
[1:42:45] praiseworthy what I know you are
[1:42:49] called hallelujah hallelujah stay with
[1:42:52] your
[1:42:54] stay with that
[1:42:55] teaching with the
[1:42:57] gifts see what
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:04] God praise
[1:43:07] God so the work here is to
[1:43:14] fish not to to f or to
[1:43:19] equip the things necessary for the
[1:43:22] journey
[1:43:24] so God just using the spiritual
[1:43:29] vision for the ministry to
[1:43:33] identify what the
[1:43:35] bride needs in
[1:43:38] season and the minister goes into prayer
[1:43:42] goes into study what does the people of
[1:43:45] God
[1:43:46] need and then this man here comes with
[1:43:50] food in season
[1:43:54] amen we thank
[1:43:56] God that by the grace of God for almost
[1:44:00] 40 years now we are feeding on food in
[1:44:09] SE that's perfecting the
[1:44:14] Saints give them
[1:44:16] some when you see they hungry in a
[1:44:18] certain
[1:44:19] way you going a different way give them
[1:44:24] some are you together with me yes sir
[1:44:28] and then you get testing
[1:44:34] tips amen but I will not tell you okay
[1:44:38] the second thing for the work of the
[1:44:43] ministry amen like baptizing the people
[1:44:47] waiting the
[1:44:48] couples standing in the ministry of the
[1:44:51] world not body will do that God has
[1:44:55] separated
[1:44:56] men for the work of the ministry so the
[1:45:00] work of the ministry means that in the
[1:45:02] economy of God he has set apart
[1:45:07] men that he has consecrated for
[1:45:12] service this also happened in the Church
[1:45:14] of
[1:45:15] Moses when he
[1:45:18] consecrated amen Aon and his son
[1:45:23] them aside for the work of the ministry
[1:45:27] Moses wased
[1:45:28] them amen and then dressed them
[1:45:33] differently consecrated them and also
[1:45:36] anointed
[1:45:38] them amen God just sets them
[1:45:41] apart they are not like the rest not
[1:45:45] just trying to lift ourselves up but
[1:45:48] there is something God has done for the
[1:45:51] ministry
[1:45:53] amen and Paul looking at the burden of
[1:45:56] the
[1:45:58] ministry the weight of the
[1:46:00] ministry he say such men deserve a
[1:46:04] Double
[1:46:08] H not because they want to be
[1:46:14] special you become a
[1:46:16] minister and you taste the soup a little
[1:46:20] bit brother James has Ted the soup a
[1:46:23] little
[1:46:26] bitp the
[1:46:33] soup are you together with me yeah
[1:46:37] there's pressure that
[1:46:40] goes the way you handle these men is an
[1:46:44] encouragement for
[1:46:46] them pray for
[1:46:48] them these are men consecrated for the
[1:46:53] pit
[1:46:55] Ministry to
[1:46:59] Edy not threaten
[1:47:02] you no but
[1:47:06] edify brother Bram
[1:47:09] said a false prophet will keep the
[1:47:13] People by threatening
[1:47:17] them but A God Called man he knows how
[1:47:21] to keep the people in
[1:47:28] them I told the church the other day on
[1:47:31] our chat
[1:47:34] room that you see this time here at the
[1:47:37] pulpit is not
[1:47:40] enough if you can't keep the
[1:47:44] people some people will Pastor
[1:47:48] them remotely Pastor them
[1:47:54] remotely on chat rooms on X and Twitter
[1:47:59] as they call
[1:48:03] it they listen more to other
[1:48:06] ministers but they are not giving you
[1:48:08] what you
[1:48:13] need they give you what they
[1:48:16] know and sometimes what's important for
[1:48:19] their places
[1:48:23] but when the
[1:48:26] Samaritan finds a wounded
[1:48:29] man he
[1:48:34] takes in that area there's a reason why
[1:48:38] God put you
[1:48:43] here Ephesians
[1:48:46] 4:13 the testimony of the
[1:48:50] ministry first of all the ministry
[1:48:55] identified their work
[1:48:58] identified but then
[1:49:00] 13 is the testimony of the
[1:49:04] ministry if the ministry has done a good
[1:49:07] work verse

[2:10:14] negative but that Feast was pointing to
[2:10:18] the day of P
[2:10:21] when God in his
[2:10:24] Perfection would come to the
[2:10:27] imperfect and start a work of seven
[2:10:31] churches to bring forth a perfect
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:37] church amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:40] he did not come to a perfect
[2:10:43] church but we thank God for the
[2:10:47] sacrifice now when the two loaves were
[2:10:51] on the of
[2:10:53] P they had to be waved
[2:10:57] together with sacrif for them to be
[2:11:04] holy praise God do you know friends all
[2:11:09] of you you are perfect in the eyes of
[2:11:15] God do you know that today you are being
[2:11:19] waved together
[2:11:21] with Christ the
[2:11:25] sacrifice
[2:11:28] amen the gift in
[2:11:31] Rebecca should teach
[2:11:34] Jacob the Divine
[2:11:36] approach to
[2:11:39] God Church the mother of
[2:11:45] Jacob that's what I'm here
[2:11:49] for that there is great
[2:11:52] in the midst of us to teach us Divine
[2:12:00] approach to
[2:12:02] possessing our
[2:12:06] inheritance so we need to build strong
[2:12:09] Church
[2:12:12] units because the calling of
[2:12:16] Israel was exactly on the same
[2:12:19] format people have become so migratory
[2:12:22] in
[2:12:24] church in this church today in that
[2:12:28] church tomorrow because they lack the
[2:12:31] principles they are looking for a holy
[2:12:34] church which they will not find we are
[2:12:38] Gentiles so God deals with
[2:12:42] you an
[2:12:48] individual are you together with me
[2:12:51] that's the principal
[2:12:53] Church Israel was in one
[2:12:56] nation but had 12 independent
[2:13:00] tribes and each tribe had a tribal
[2:13:05] leadership and
[2:13:09] every one
[2:13:11] nation
[2:13:13] churches reminding us of church being
[2:13:16] one
[2:13:17] body but having different insights
[2:13:22] local
[2:13:23] churches God is in every one of those
[2:13:28] churches working differently depending
[2:13:31] on the needs of the
[2:13:34] church even Israel each tribe had a
[2:13:38] particular
[2:13:40] commission but yet all of them encamped
[2:13:44] around the same
[2:13:47] Tabernacle under the same law under the
[2:13:50] same Prophet under the same goal in
[2:13:54] Exodus under the same you know
[2:13:57] sacrifice under the same pill of
[2:14:00] fire are you together with me so our
[2:14:03] local churches are not in
[2:14:08] competition praise God are you together
[2:14:11] with me we may be
[2:14:14] different the way of deliver of
[2:14:17] services but that's according to what
[2:14:20] the serious challenges
[2:14:25] are so our churches are not in
[2:14:29] competition but under a different
[2:14:34] anointing depending on the needs of a
[2:14:38] local amen are you here ministers we are
[2:14:42] not competing with
[2:14:44] anybody oh we've got more people we've
[2:14:48] got more this it's just like in a
[2:14:52] see you know somebody's fishing here
[2:14:55] there's more fish in that place there is
[2:14:59] less fish it's not because you are a
[2:15:01] better
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:08] fisherman are you together with me when
[2:15:10] is
[2:15:14] iter God bless
[2:15:17] you brother

[2:15:31] local
[2:15:34] church he also say every one of you has
[2:15:39] got something to do
[2:15:41] now every one of you get right in your
[2:15:46] church and work just as hard as you can
[2:15:52] for your local church but don't never
[2:15:58] [Applause]

[2:16:03] with the
[2:16:04] people how can the hand criticize the
[2:16:15] fruit praise the Lord Brother Bram says

[2:17:43] the I given him the spirit and the
[2:17:47] word but that's not over
