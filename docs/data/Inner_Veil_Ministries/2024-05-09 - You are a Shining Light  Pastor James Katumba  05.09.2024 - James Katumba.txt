and pray that father you may answer every one of them may you now speak to our hearts lording to purpose and will name Jesus Christ this amen let us go to the Book of John chapter 5 and then we're reading from verse 33 to verse 36 so the Bible says he sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I receive no testimony from man but the things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and Shining Light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light blessing his word may be seated so I want to preach on you are a shining light you are a shining light so now the Lord Jesus was telling the Jews that John the Baptist was a burning and Shining Light praise the name of the Lord he had a light that he brought in other words he brought the word of God he brought the message of God and you know God sent John at the time when the law was coming to the law was coming to an end the dispensation of the law was coming to an end and then we were getting into Grace and then John started a way and then he the message was baptism of repentance praise the name of our Lord baptism of repentance and then that was the message of John telling people there's one coming after me whose shoes I'm not able to unloose he says I bapt you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire so John came with that light it was a burning light it was a Shining Light people were asking John what shall we do praise the name of our Lord Pharisees came and asked him you know who are you then you know the the soldiers came to him what shall we do the publicans came to him watch the publicans what shall we do and then he was telling them what to do showing them the light that this is the light walk in this light this is the way walk in this way praise the name of our Lord and so now even Us Praise the name of our Lord once we receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is the light itself and then that gospel dwells in us and then that gospel transforms us it makes us to become Delight praise the name of our Lord we become The Shining Light that when the people see us like in Matthew Chapter 5 the Bible says you are the light okay us say 5:3 you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his saver wherewith shall it be sorted it is than Force good for nothing but to be cast out and to be Tren under the foot of men are the light of the world a seat that is set on Hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under bushel but on a Candlestick and it gives light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which in praise the name of our Lord so he says we are the light of the world and as the light of the world we need to shine forth his life and then he says when they see your good works then they will glorify the Father which is in heaven so we need to see that we allow the light of Jesus Christ because our Lord Jesus Christ is the light of the world when we go to John chapter one The Bible says let us go to John chapter one and then vers John 1 vers four in whom was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended not there was a man sent forth from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that comes into the world praise the name of our so our lord Jesus is that great light is the True Light praise the name of our Lord and then he says he came into the world he is the light that shines and you know you need light to see where you are going you need light to understand what is exactly happening and our Lord Jesus Christ is that true light and he is the word and then the Bible says the life that was in him is the light of men so that when we also receive the life of Jesus Christ how how do we receive the life of Jesus Christ we receive the life of Jesus Christ by accepting him as our personal savior when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and then you repent of your sins and then you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then he justifies you praise the name of our Lord he removes your past sin he removes your kind of things you've done the darkness that was there but right there in you there is still elements there is still a nature of Desiring to do wrong things so then Christ himself by his word starts working on that nature to see that the darkness goes away so he sanctifies you the more you obey the word of God the more you are Sanctified and then those works of darkness keep on departing and as they keep on going away you are being separated from the things that are contrary to God and so now when the men see your walk they see the light shining praise the name of the Lord we are a shining light and each of us should become a Shining Light a shining light at your home a shining light at your place of work a shining light at your school let them see your good works praise the name of our Lord where all the world would revenge in because somebody does them wrong then for you you pray with love that's light shining praise the name of our Lord when they see your good works they will glorify the Father which is in heaven praise the name of our Lord so we need to allow the light of Jesus Christ to completely take over our lives that we can also in turn become the light in the places that we praise the name of our Lord the Bible says we are written Epistles read of all men praise the name of our Lord so then you allow the word of God to influence you to change your thinking to change your mind to direct you praise the name of our Lord now in the message God's provided of approach to Fellowship he says our gracious Heavenly Father we are indeed privileged people that we can look into thy face and call thee Our Father knowing this that we have passed from Death un life because we have believed on the only begotten son and through his suffering and through suffering and dying and yes Rising again to live forever more we have eternal life through this faith in him then he says and there is many things in our lives that is not just right we are a people that walking in darkness in this world with that light we can find from heaven walking in the Dark World walking in the light as light flashes on our paths and we pray heavenly father that the light of God will so flash on our paths that we will be able to be a Shining Light to others that they may see the Glorious Gospel of the Lord Jesus and come into this Great Fellowship praise the name of our Lord we need also to be a shining light but you can't be a Shining Light if you don't walk in the light of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so we need to walk in the light of Jesus Christ we need to be obedient to the word of God and now when we are obedient to the word of God that word becomes manifested in US it becomes a living reality and that life of the word becomes the light to the others praise the name of our Lord wherever you are living when you are manifesting the life of Jesus you are a shining light that is shining to all those people praise the name of our Lord when they see your good work then the Bible says they will glorify the Father which is in heaven so what we need to do is when we hear the word of God obedient to that word and the more you are obedient to that word the more the word changes your mind the word changes your decision making the word changes your desires the word changes all you know your influences and now when the word has changed your mind then now you have the mind of Jesus Christ even your words which come out of your mouth will be based on the mind of God that is in you and then even your actions the things that you do the things that you spend your time in will be dictated by the word that is in you and then there you'll not be dwelling in darkness but you'll be dwelling in the light and as you dwell in the light you produce the light praise the name of our Lord that's what God wants us to do every one of us praise the name of our Lord now in the message the great Shining Light he says what are we today we are stars every born again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ start reflect the power and Holiness of the Lord Jesus Christ reflect him in his life to perfect him in his speech to perfect him in his healing power to perfect him in his resurrection reflect him in every way that he was reflected To Us by the father We Are Stars watch what kind of star should you be then he says this star was not Guided by its own power it was Guided by the celestial powers of the almighty God so he was talking about that stud the wise men were following how they were following that St and as they followed that star the star LED them where Christ was praise the name of our Lord and we have seven stars for the seven Church ages praise the name of our Lord and the Stars praise the name of our Lord can be seen when there's Darkness and we see that through the ages there was Darkness so now God would send a start every age and then that star would Shine by The Power of the Gospel which the Lord would give that star and the Seven Stars were the seven messengers of the seven Church ages and we have had a star in our age praise the name of our Lord and that star shines praise the name of our Lord when the star of John Shine the way the star of John the Baptist shine telling them the sacrific of animals has come to an end now God requires you to repent God requires to be baptized and then he introduced the Messiah Behold the Lamb of God what was he he was showing them the light praise the name of our so even in our day we have had a bright shining light praise the name of our Lord and that light when was shining preached get out from denominations praise the name of our Lord get from Trinity preach get out from infant baptism get away from baptism of little children get from baptism in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost get up from women preaching you know it was the light shining praise the name of our Lord bringing the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the time that we're living praise the name of our Lord so then he said there is therefore now no condemnation says okay let me get behind it was Guided by the celestial power of almighty God and if we are ever going to reflect Sinners to Christ we've got to be guided by the Holy Spirit Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that in Christ walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if we are going to be a star to reflect the Light of Christ to bring Sinners to him we have going to be guided by the Holy Ghost praise the name of our Lord then he said and we cannot be unordinary we have to be unusual we cannot be us because God's people are a peul people they have been through the ages although pulia yet the star was brilliant not brilliant in the world's education wild is Affairs but brilliant as the sacrifice before the Lord we our as the did in the presence of the king of kings reflect his light you are a star every Christian is a star to guide the Lost praise the name of our we have many lost people at home we have many lost people in our neighborhood has put you there to be a St to them to shine praise the name of the Lord there are many lost people at our places of work there are many lost people at our schol there many we find on our ways so God has appointed you to become a Shining Light praise the name of the Lord let them see your light and then they desire to be like you how I wish I was like that God how I wish I was like that Bo how I wish I was like that man how I wish I was like that woman you should Shine the Light each and every one of us has been given the privilege praise the name of our Lord to shine in the midst of gross Darkness praise the name of our Lord there was gross darkness in the house of n he was full of leprosy and then the Bible says he had done a lot of exploits God had used him to do a lot of things but now the Little M girl a young girl when she saw the Boss full of leprosy she become the light in that house praise the name of our Lord she gave a testimony that there there is a prophet in Israel if my master go to that prophet he would be healed of his and yet the Bible say there was no leper who was ever healed in the days of elishah but how did this girl know that there is a prophet and the prophet can help this man she was a God-fearing little girl so each and every one of us regardless of your size regardless of how young you are you were called to be a shining praise the name of our Lord Shining Light praise the name of our Lord like if somebody has you know thrown their money down not knowing you are a shining disappear it up you are a shining light you've gone to the sh to buy something and then they have given you more money than they meant to give you you are a shining light you have given me more money praise the name of our Lord that's what the Lord wants us to live a life at home Shining Light at school a shining light at a place of work are a shining light praise the name of the Lord so the testimony of that made caus to go to his King and then the king wrote the king of Israel my servant has leprosy I'm told there healing there can you heal him and now you can imagine that the king of Israel the whole king of Israel didn't know that elishah can pray for somebody to be healed of can you imagine that until it was told the prophet that the king of Israel is complaining about the king of Syria why does he tell him to heal say am I going to heal then the prophet told them bring them tell them to come praise the name of our Lord and then the Lord Jesus Christ picks that testimony and he says there were many lepers in the days of el but elishah was not sent to anyone other than n Syrian how was he sent to if there was no star a shining light that small mid girl in the in the house of so God has called every one of us it doesn't matter what kind of place of work you are in it doesn't matter what level of work you do sometimes you may be an office messenger you know you One S to send letters to you may be a at place of work you may be a cleaner at your place of regardless of the work of theary you are act God has made you a Shining Light praise the name of the Lord so you need to shine that light wherever God has placed you let the people see your good work praise the name of our Lord let them people see your good work like now

from those people you will show kindness you will show goodness you will show love you will show support not only about getting your salary if somebody gives you money then you are kind no even when they not giving you anything you are still good you are still kind praise the name of our Lord you know we're living in an end time where the Bible says let us go the book of First Timothy praise the name of our Lord First Timothy okay I think we can go to is second Timothy and verse chter 3 verse one the Bible says this also this also this know also that in the last days perious times shall come and then it starts mentioning what is going to happen men shall be lovers of their own selves that's Darkness now if you are the light shining you act contrary to this where people love themselves that they don't care about somebody else but then for you are concerned about somebody else men shall become you know Busters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despers of those that are good [Music] traitors lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God that's Darkness so you are the light to shine in the midst of that where the others are traitors you don't do that they are you know they love Pleasures more than God but your sacrifice prise the name of the Lord like right now it has been raining then you say I'm not staying home because it is cold I'm not staying home because it is wet on the RO I'm not staying home because I'm going to become wet I have to go into the presence of gods of God more than Pleasures but when you love Pleasures but I don't have transport but now when you love God praise the name of our Lord and it is time for Fellowship you'll close down your sh and then come for Fellowship praise the name of our Lord why you are a shining light and every right decision you make it's the light shining praise the name of our Lord It's the light shining and this is what the Lord wants us to do you to be manifested light praise the name of our Lord he says you are a star every Christian is a star to guide the lost to guide the we the foot of the traveler to those who are seeking then the Stars cannot be guided by itself it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the Brilliance of God in it its life to abstain from the things of the world and to live Godly in this present life it must reflect the light of its great one that shine praise the name of the Lord then he says what are we to do then to Rise and Shine the Light Of God to the dying in the depth of Darkness of this world we are to reflect and Shine the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in his resurrecting power as he is this yesterday today so to reflect him praise the name of God has called us to be a Shining Light praise the name of our Lord so you can't say not me we have been called to be a Shining Light praise the name of Lord first Thessalonians 5 and then verse 5 the Bible says you are the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness the world is in darkness there are children of the night they are children of Darkness but God has called us to be the children of the light the children of the day praise the name of our Lord where by what you speak from your heart is exactly what you're thinking about not speaking this and then you're thinking something else but that's how the world is somebody tells you this but is meaning this then you start saying but for me he told me this then they know he meant this that's what the world is somebody speaks this today then tomorrow he says I mean what they saying Liars all the time convenant truth Breakers he says this then he turns around something that's how the world is Children of Darkness but we are the children of the light and therefore we should walk in the light as the children of God let us go to Ephesians 5:1 he says be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us for an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling ser but forication and uncleanness andness let it not be once named among you has become Saint neither fness not a foolish talking verse four nor which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no nor unlean person nor aous man who is an idolator has an inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and praise the name of our Lord these are all works of darkness so then you get out from all those evil things you get out from Evil speaking you get out from lust of the flesh you get it from all the wicked things people do you get from that Darkness why you are a shining light praise the name of the Lord let the people see your good works and then glorify the Father which is at Heaven that's what we are called to do wherever we are wherever you are living whoever you are God has called us to be a Shining Light praise the name of when the men see your good works they glorify the Father which is in heaven praise the name of our Lord then the scripture says let us go to verse six let no man deceive you with vain [Music] words for because of these things comes the wrath of God unto the children of Disobedience be not therefore partakers with them don't be equally yed with unbelievers praise the name of don't be equally they will say this get tra praise the name of the Lord don't be equally yed why do you go in their Association you know they like sports betting and then you also there oh you know I have not had money so let me also try to get some money you are equally to them they going to the bar oh me I'm going to drink soda you know there some time ago one of the beer companies around started bringing that it beer what and it was in the bottle like a beer you can also sit with your friends in the if you don't want to drink beer you're moving together with them praise the name of our Lord you know you are joining the dirty jokes they makeing you are getting evil spirits from them so you receiving Darkness you are darkening yourself you are destroying your influence and you are losing the power of God praise the name of our Lord you are getting yourself into a station of Samson until Samson gave himself and there was no more power of God you shouldn't reach that kind of level whereby you have lost the power of God that keeps you you've lost the power of God that directs you you lost the power of God that gives you the grace overcome all your weaknesses so the Bible says therefore not partakers with them verse eight for you are sometimes Darkness the Bible says we are sometimes Darkness but now are you the light in the Lord we have renounced the hidden things of Darkness praise the name of the Lord you depart darkness and then you get into the light and then the Bible says you are sometimes Darkness but now you are light in the Lord so as we are light in the Lord the Bible says walk as children of the light praise the name of our Lord we are a shining light God has called us to be the light To Shine the Light to shine at they light to shine at school they light to shine in the commun where we live they light to shine where we were have a testimony that follows you praise the name of our Lord you have been at this way place of work there a testimony you go to another place you have a testimony even after maybe 5 years praise the name of the Lord your light is now brighter praise the name of our Lord after 10 years much brighter after 20 years much brighter Shining Light praise the name of our Lord and as a star you are always guided praise the name of our Lord as the sun shines the Moon receives from the Sun and even us as Christians we receive the great light from Christ himself Christ coming down in our lives and Shining that light on your own you can't shine but when Christ is in you praise the name of our Lord he will shine his Works he will do his great works praise the name of our Lord he will give you the ability to overcome The Temptations to overcome the trials to overcome the testing to overcome the strations you go through in life and then you'll be able to live the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord why because he's living right inside of you praise the name of our Lord and that's what the Lord wants us to do to be a light to shine praise the name of our Lord we are children of the light we need to live in the light as our Lord Jesus Christ is the light praise the name of our Lord see that you do the things that are pleasing to God praise the name of our Lord take time wait on the Lord let him be formed in you let him transform you let him bring you to the image the image of Jesus Christ not yourself but him working right inside of you praise the name of our Lord I want to read another quote as I try to finish praise the name of our Lord in the message Shalom shom he says Rise and Shine for the light has come to you the word the light is Vindicated the only way as God was Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God spoken word the light of the hour John the Baptist was the light of the hour it was the light before Jesus was the prophet Isaiah said a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and make straight his path that was the spoken word of God was laying there had not come to life yet Mal the last prophet 400 years before it take place he said behold I send my messenger before me to prepare the way of the Lord here come one out of the Wilderness without denomination without Creed without identification but his light identified him the word identified him they said you are the Messiah he said I am not but the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord Jesus said you did walk in his light he was a bright and Shining Light for a while why until the way was prepared then his light went out then he said you can't walk in that light you baptized this is the light of the hour the light has come Rise and Shine the word the light word the manifested word of God is a light praise the name of our Lord so right now where the light is is in the message of the hour the revealed word of God is where the light of God is the rest of the world is in darkness they don't know what to do they have no power to overcome all the traps of Satan but the power only is in the message this is where the will of God is praise the name of our Lord so we need to take the message of the hour put time in reading the message time in hearing the message put time in testifying about the message praise the name of our Lord you are walking in the life you are receiving the life and as you receive that life as you obey the word you become that light praise the name of our Lord you let your light so shine and the light shines in darkness we see Darkness everywhere God is calling every one of us to be a light to shine to shine where we live to shine at our scho to shine at where we are from and everywhere you are be the light to shine praise the name of our Lord P's wife she was living in darkness and she thought that Joseph would enjoy her Darkness but Joseph refused to get into the darkness of P but he shined the light praise the name of our Lord he said how can I do this things in the face of God he had the fear of God he shined the light completely different from the foolish you know they want to be praise the name of the Lord and they become celebrities by doing bad things that's how they are known everybody knows no Jose was not
