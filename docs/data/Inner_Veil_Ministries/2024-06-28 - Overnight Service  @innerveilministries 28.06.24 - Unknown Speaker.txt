small encouragement I pray that the Lord May bless us amen however I felt weak not to come I felt very weak not to come but so thank God all the joury master that where we are he made us to reach amen I want us to read just one verse bless amen so let's go to the Book of Mark chapter 11 just read one verse the Bible says verse 22 Mark 11se 22 Jesus and he answered and he and Jesus answering them sayto them have faith in God the Lord blessing reading of the words you may be seated amen so you know I want to thank God for the pastors for the opportunity they gave me to stand before you I'm always challenged standing the of ithy Praise the Lord otherwise you make mistakes otherwise you make mistakes if you make mistakes you know they know how to to entangle you and get you they read the word Prophet so there's no way you can bypass it's such a challenge but we only depend on thece of God Amen so here the Bible said Jesus was telling these people that have faith in God so my title is faith in God Amen so you see it's a plain statement No play like light you know it's weak and light and you know which someone can take for granted Jesus said have faith in God Amen this statement it's not easy to make praise the lord it's not easy without God because why did Jesus say how faith in him you know one time Jesus was hungry and he wanted to eat so while he was passing far there was a fig tree praise the Lord that Jesus wanted to eat on it and then the tree had no fruit praise the Lord then when he found it not with fruits he said I think verse 12 verse 12 he said [Music] yes verse 12 okay let me go to 14 verse 14 and Jesus answered and said unto eat the tree no man eat fruit there there no man eat fruit of the herea forever [Music] and his dises it when they had it they kept it praise the Lord they kept it but the truth is this tree had no problem praise the Lord it had no problem it was not because it was not bearing fruits this tree was not Burse verse says and seeing a fig tree far having leaves if happily he may find anything there and when he came to e he found nothing and the Bible says but thees he found nothing but the leaves but now for the time of the Fig was not yet so the tree had no problem like you find doesn't okay you find the season is not for will be but the fruits will wait for the season so this big tree had no problem is that right whereby Jesus wanted to demonstrate something here and what he wanted to demonstrate verse something what Jesus wanted to demonstrate here then in the morning they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up the roots and then Peter calling to remembrance him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cast castest is withered away 22 and Jesus said answering and answering sat to them have faith praise the Lord where God wanted to demonstrate Fai he used some impossibility he used some impossibility whereby it's very hard if a tree is given environment it will bear fruits it was called to bear fruit given season it will bring forth praise the Lord but Jesus wanted to demonstrate to these men you got to have faith in God so he used the tree and cast and it right but behind it the scenario Jesus wanted them to have faith that they can say praise the Lord Jesus wanted them whatever speak but he us that tree to show them that you can do it even when I'm not around you know something like because he left the power behind all these things praise the Lord Jesus said have faith in God praise the Lord now the illustration of making the mountain move to Seas is abolutely praise the Lord how can somebody call come and fall in L Victor first of all because Victoria praise okay on it there are people so you mean you're going to kill them praise the Lord Jesus wanted them even believe the imposs if you have faith in him so the fig tree right because it doesn't bear fruits because the Bible says at that moment when Jesus found it was not yet praise the Lord the season was not yet Jesus wanted to demonstrate power behind a spoken word praise the Lord only have faith in and that's all praise the Lord have faith in God is impossible have faith in God praise the Lord but you know sometimes According To Jesus that's the point the hardest moment impossible that impossible moment is when God requires you to have faith in him praise the Lord many of us we know the imposs in our lives we know them just imagine becoming a manager Man Without papers in Uganda here It seems impossible becoming a prime minister it's impossible without papers without elections but was one without without election but just faith in God made him what he was but where did he go through to reach there in imposs prison casted down in the dit did he have faith that he can become a prime minister when he was in the ditch the Lord The Impossible when God calls us to have faith in him and while we have faith in I want to assure you nothing is impossible praise the Lord nothing is impossible where God is the Lord there's nothing which is impossible unless he has not come for that praise the Lord because Jesus said there were many leers in the days of n the reason so faith in God is what we do all things that we think they are impossible like in this book Mark the gospel tells us and Mark has always emphasized Believers EMP Believers to believe God only praise the Lord otherwise without believing God then how can he work for with praise the Lord without God how can I mean without believing in God how can he work with you praise the Lord God can't work with people who don't have faith in him work with people who doubt his word praise the Lord now I want us to go through some of the things which are impossible but to God they were possible praise the Lord now faith in God it is aing [Music] thing to many people as I said it is not easy that statement is not easy so brother say faith in God it is a St to people going ask how praise the Lord faith in God is a staggering thing to many people and yet we ought to be ashamed of [Music] ourselves to confess that we don't have faith in God first there is cowardness or [Music] cowards who di 10,000 deaths while they they are here on Earth that's what the prophet says dying why they on Earth why are they dying because they are cowards and God hates cowards the God hates cowards people are of cowards don't say this death which we think about and you know that death there are many death somebody can die of cancer and is not healed brother God told him nothing shall stand before you even cancer but cancer is killing believer don't Mis me please I want to talk about the imposs praise the Lord is killing people and yet the healer is telling us what is hard before you cancer have faith in God praise the Lord another and usually people who have faith are people who have experience praise the Lord those who have faith they that have experiences praise the Lord talk about one day we here overnight and I remember brother was testifying in a certain Lake there so when you think about people who can call not gone through se you don't have experience you don't have and it is very hard you to have faith in that but knows what it takes to redeem you out of there most of us who have gone in legs this Rivers we see here I remember I I know he knows it I know he knows when you are in Lake Victoria Lake Victoria you can neither see where you came from neither east or west or north whatever water so where are you going praise the Lord but these people wanted to gr and it was you know me I'm just talking it plainly brought it until I was like now how did this man come out but then has experience in case it happens have faith and he know experience brings Faith that's what brother say that experience brings Faith praise the Lord so usually people have faith they have experience praise the Lord so now you know one day there was a man David this man he believed God and he knew god father told him how God operates not only that but he went through experience of how God works to I mean to believe I mean to for [Music] sure I don't know how many people have seen [Music] Lions you know how big a lion let me say a lion is not such [Music] big a is large and big [Music] throw down the right isn't it but a man cannot throw it down in other words to us can carry us on the MTH is that right it can carry us on the M sometimes tin can car and CLS with it on a tree but to us water don't think somebody can climb steps with them back like to even get support and stuff like that but I want to assure you while he was in the in the bush looking after the the flock of the father there came something that threatened the flock threatening animal but God stood with David and gave him confidence training him the experience to depend on God because he didn't have a b nether he have a gun so what was the depend of David for that if it wasn't praise the Lord sometimes dogs can threaten if you don't have a can make even I don't know how you can I don't know running but very small animal like praise the Lord so in other words David was teaching him experience of something that was coming he even didn't know and what was that he was glor praise the Lord he went through for so that can develop experience which will bring Faith act on God's program praise the Lord and here comes very young not trained in the Army and here goes the father sends him check on your brothers are they alive some food to them so here comes David on the ground on the battle is hearing someone threatening the whole arm of God imagine the trained of Israel just one voice it is threatening the whole nation let's go to [Music] First praise the Lord first Samuel 1 praise the Lord gor verse I think I just want one verse 11 is calling who can come and encounter me among one man to come and encounter me 11 praise the Lord and then the Bible says well he was talking when the king and all Israel heard these words they were dismayed and greatly afraid now this is a nation one man threatening them all and at the end of the day they don't have even one solution for him they started trembling you know the king you are the one who has more experience you should go there my friend you King was afraid who was the most trained man the most giant in Israel praise the Lord afraid of just one man the whole Army none could stand him look at how God does things David is coming find such things then he asking them who is this uncircum Frey is afraid one manav the he asking a question of Mo to theise the Lord then he said then he said I want to go to verse [Music] verse 33 was 30 something the Bible says then and David said to S let no man heart fail of him thy servant will go and fight with this the Lord this man everyone is afraid of him why because they don't have experience of God where had they got that experience to stand the imposs they had no experience they were depending on the training they had gone through and they had had history about this giant man had defeated him in Praise the Lord now he comes here challenging the whole nation these are children of God lordus Only Have Faith praise the Lord but because they don't have experience then it is very hard apply fath what David to go there he [Music] testimony to stand glorious experience and that experience if you hear his testimony he say The God Who delivered me so he had experience God can still deliver him that's why this man to David he was nothing this impossible to Israel was possible to God praise the Lord therefore because of this man's experience with God brought faith and took away fear and took away card and then cowardness and then God came and stood on his praise the Lord because he had a good word is this uncircumcised then was say wow the army of God then God said a might coner prise the Lord so God him then nothing praise the Lord was nothing with God The Impossible they are possible praise the Lord in other words where man ends that is the beginning of God where you have ended God is just planning even to start praise the Lord people ended they were afraid this man may come for us they were afraid praise the Lord but the impossible God makes them possible then if God is for us Us Praise us I doubt whether until one p say sometimes children of God can live a life that can make the devil doesn't understand anything CRA where you can know this that theil can run czy this David knows it and he that story because even when he said I'm going for that the king said my boy don't don't come here called you Brothers go back home you mean you can stand him with what what a imagine mancing them I'm the only one has experience to keep before he finishes the statement praise the Lord first of all to shoot a g no experience do you know to do you know how to salute for the so which stat you tell even before you reach them the Lord but David for that just imagine you are the captain of that if I was one I take off myav has defeated me praise the Lord with the imposs is possible to him and if God is for us then why do we reason we don't have experience with him praise the Lord if you don't have experience with very easy to The Impossible sometimes you explain them they very right when they are very right if when the doctor looks at your report it but when God says it can't Beed then why why don't you depend on him praise the Lord praise the Lord so without experience it's hard to live with the life of faith that's why Jesus said a very easy statement but it's very hard to stand if you don't have experience with Christ praise the lord we sing songs to be like Jesus but have we thought how Jesus was before we want to be like him praise the Lord to be like Jesus on Earth I long thank you for longing but Christ without his experience you can't stand what he did and yet with him it's very possible I don't know C praise the Lord one thing I tell you to be like Jesus one day Jesus was on the cross praise the Lord he was on the cross and then on the cross the hands nailed across the legs nailed and he was in pain praise the Lord and then if that Jesus if that Jesus they brought something around him maybe dancing I don't think he would dance to be like Jesus praise the Lord I don't think dance on the cross is going on maybe parties at school if they not Christian parties Jesus he cannot dance the tunes reason he in pain and yet the Bible tells us car your cross and follow me then the cross is forward for you to nail there while you on the then some friend of yours brings you the Min time when we are going there put on like this office but the how will you handle such the Lord to be like Jesus as you first Christ before you for first have an experience with him you long for him otherwise a trial will come and you will forget to be like Jesus something very light and minor come before you you forget that song at the end of the day you for sure even youie but then to be like Jesus there are so many things that come and we forget the promises in but in all things Jesus have faith praise the Lord what is too hard have faith praise the Lord now another thing there was a man in the days of elij then this man one day there were scenarios that in the days of prophet El then the king said who is telling our secrets who who is telling our secrets because whenever we are going to do something it is not done in other words those days when they used to prepare to go and attack Israel would beat them in their land before they set then the person was asking who is against us in oury one man no one everyone of us is faith we are disciplined we them not to share out Secrets but there is only one can tell even the secrets of your the Lord then somebody said who is that one the king him when Hew that I wish was other if he can tell secrets in your bed then what about your movement so here comes the scenario they are aware that El theyed to attack him on their way they Rich then in the in the morning the ran out alas my master that is second Kings chapter 6 second Kings chapter 6 verse 15 and he said my master what shall we do and he said that's now the prophet Second Kings chapter 6 and verse 15 he says what shall we do verse 16 then he says not for they that be with us more be with them praise the Lord this man has SW the whole Army around in the mountain and was afid why was he afraid he had no experience praise the Lord why was this this servant afraid he had no experience with the Lord surrounded them for sure we are gone but God who is of the imposs made it way praise the Lord and then he said so what I wanted here this man the servant because of lack of experience with God then fear came and when fear came what happened lacked faith in God and when heed Faith he didn't know how the Army would leave that M but what did I mean the prophet said had experience with God was not even afraid but yet come to so what happened experience with God he didn't fear what he told this man he rebed [Music] him and told him don't fear those people much as they are many the ones who are with us are more than them and what did El say he said Lord Open the Eyes of the young man and when the young man what happened the experience developed experience experience came God helped him and he had Faith therefore experience brings faith and when Faith Comes what happen the imposs turn and what happens El then he went down and asked them what do you want that El follow me he took them back to their land then he disappeared then he said go open their eyes but is that what the servant expected maybe saw this Chariot full with fire thought they going to bur them the experience of God came down into his mind and then brought Fai in him God way made way until that Army left the mountain with ignorance the enemy himself the one who them back for sure is impossible you're looking for cus [Applause] here I don't know how blind they were I can't express the most of us talk aboutness but brother the darkness that struck Egypt it was even fa it's not this one here where you put buls and you chase it out the one for is impossible us very to ask God is possible to them who don't have his experience who don't have faith in him God has already seemed impossible praise the Lord he has already seemed just imagine crossing the Red Sea leads them to the come them this side mountains this side deserts in front a SE there which you don't have experience to swim that you and run quickly after the armies had more experience in anything that was around them driving on the mountain they had more experience running in the desert they were more experienced talk about even I think swimming they had experience then the miserable Israelites the were not in and then comes a scenario that you are meant to fight with the experienced when they looked back the was coming detected they detected it was for Pharaoh they started Ting Moses was there no graes in egyp that you let us to die in the wilderness reason they had no experience on how God could help them which brought down their faith and God hates cowards that's why along the way when they were developing cowardness open because of and let me assure you where there is unbelief you know the mysteries of the Bible where there is unbelief brother says God cannot work he can't work where there is unbelief canot work praise the Lord he can't work therefore the imposs if you have faith in God praise the Lord like I [Music] said okay in the message our faith [Music] today so we talked about and then the prophet says while in the armies of the Israelites sa the great warrior if there was any man in the whole Army that was more opt to be able to [Music] go and fight this giant but the Bible says he greatly feared but yet was the most able that then he said first he was well trained Warrior he know all the Maneuvers how to dodge the Spears and how to knock them off of him and above that he was a Head and Shoulder above any man in this phally for ACH and he was a trainer of men but here comes a man without experience with all the qualities but he feared praise the Lord all the qualities but when it came to sin and action no sin when it came to action he fear praise the Lord why no experience and the prophet continues to say another he continues to say and such that is paragraph 19 and such today okay but if we notice while this giant was making his great boast and his great theologi as it would be stand there well trained to know how to fight he had never had any experience with God and SE a Pity to to see men and women who have lived church and been brought up in the cand [Music] RO okay and now the Bible yet has never witnessed an experience with God so such people they are trained in church they know the Bible the P without the experience of God when [Music] stand Lord people would fly one scenario brother Bram was on the pit and then there came a giant and the prophet says all the ministers on the platform here I don't want to State any statement against them the prophet says fled now the police which was guarding the the camp [Music] theori came against him was pushing them the prophet said leave him then the people said brother he said leave him then he came because the prophet had experience he stood but this man he had been told come and box the prophet him he come to box him one and go because he was a man who had taken all the F of people people then they they they brought him that giant now he comes and the prophet true and when he came the prophet said he went beyond his bound and when he went what happened faith in God prophet came what happened he made the man bend down kissed the Propet butet praise the Lord experience with God these Giants these Giants of ours we have Giants but when they are before us the experience we have with God can them but if you don't have God's experience Giants will make you fly even though you know the Mysteries the Lord so these Giants brother [Music] says but yet he has never witnessed an experience with God what we need is to go back to the real heartfelt experience to know who we've got faith our faith is in God as Jesus told us the truth is cannot stand where we are because the fa we have in put him of the platform cannot praise the Lord he says not some writings okay he says we've got to have we've what we need is get back to the real heartfelt experience to know who we've got faith in not some writings but the true and living God who lives now praise the Lord The God Who lives now is the one whom we are meant to have experience and faith if he has not worked for you which I doubt none of us has not felt experience but you know why we tend to take them as light let me give you an example being alive now don't think is a [Music] granted oh don't think it is it is it is the it is the Lord to be alive now and breathing it's not granted no it's it's a it's part of you you know that every have to breae the truth is what about when you are sleeping have you realize that you bre or [Music] not but sometimes we UNC inaming amever then even when you're America your dream is telling you that you living is the grace of God and it is the gift that God has given without him then you are not meant to be so people take it as thing but it's not okay talk about eating people say have aot of food you're right but there are many people in hospital have you have praise the Lord I want you to see that we live by God so each of us at least we have an experience with God that can en US have Fai in Him Praise the Lord talk about that woman when it was a scenario of of drought [Music] all food over no digging no no digging no water but then have oil but other people outside they eating their children others eating D you you have food now that woman in that condition she can't boast because you remove you find one has Prov and leaves his fingers on then you say who this you make a certain shape you remove then God brings back that woman can't praise the Lord so we every one of us we have experience of how we can have faith in God praise the Lord walk outs I wish you people move at night you see that people sleeping on the in you I wish you have OPP to go to to they sleep on their like this but for you have a very comfortable bed think learn we have exper at least experience praise the Lord last time we were in hospital you know my baby was you know threaten then to us threatened so what happened there people were dying in our like I was saying good me to be at home then we are me to be at home because we are okay praise the Lord like four babies died before us but to us when is like people praise the Lord I wish people [Music] some of us we have F oh we can move we can go but people who want to move oned their legs are like this some of them they are straighten they put some weight the other side we are very we need to thank God that is just an experience to help you to have Fai in God praise the Lord I I know we have experience don't only think maybe we take them Journey you to be walking part of your journey that every day you meant to have it no praise the Lord but if God gives you you know sometimes the Old Testament was for our example praise the Lord it was for our example look at how suff for me to know that even in I can thank God and I can praise him but is that so with us praise the Lord so reason in thatal and then we [Music] are weing and yet likes us have experience with him then after the experience it draws Faith down and when faith comes down in that message St of a perfect man the prophet said faith is the foundation now if the foundation is such hard like then what aboutt praise the Lord because on faith but then what will you on faith is not there praise the Lord so he says faith is the foundation of all of Praise the Lord and then he says for without faith it's impossible to pleas God is this what the prophet says without faith it's impossible praise the Lord maybe another one thing I know is God but first it's going to be Faith let me stay on the foundation for Is What You Must Believe substance HED for it's it's you already have it when you have no that same point is what I wanted but I wanted to analyze it so that it is clear that same point where we were [Music] reading it's yes there he says faith is the substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things HED for what kind of an Evidence Brothers evidence maybe another another one [Music] another [Music] one I want that one which says faith brings good down the prophet says fath go down go go yes there I want you to State there he says that's go when they make a phone call and say that that contact and your faith brings God it's the thing that brings the prayer which you have come to do and our prayer and what brings them here the faith without the faith these two they un effect come no where there is no faith because without faith you can't please God if you have not pleased God if when you bring him down he just judge you [Music] immedi because you have not pleased him if you bring him down when you have your faith your prayer and God together sin then he says prayer Faith changes from here to here it brings it together that's what the prophet says I want I want to finish praise the Lord I want to finish that's what the prophet says our faith brings him and the prayer together and when pray and together then the answer there it brings God from up down what you have prayed and comes back with it then there's an answer praise the Lord so what have you prayed for what have you come to pray for what brings God down faith in him if you've not brought God down don't judge me wrong prer other we've come for show after is the ground there you have come to show you know a show is I don't know they have always brought plantations which already to show you course no to show you you know actually to please you some sugar cane which is Big you think you can make it the way it is then you buy SE bring them to your when we come to show grounds is not doesn't come to praise the Lord he comes in reality he brings the banana when God breaks banana in this praise the Lord they bring a certain animal toce that this one can get big in three months when you take it it takes years without even wonder what was it but you forgot it was a show yeah you have come to show you me money the Lord that's why many of ministers use the power of for at the end of the day oh man of God oh man of God when the man of God say people are for the man of until people are sing you know I S WhatsApp people selling PL to go to heav right oh my God and are of they praise the Lord so even us when we come in prayer when we come for prayer meetings and we have not drawn God down there are two things if maybe God is waiting for something to answer I it a yeah praise the Lord oh my you really help me to stand am praise the Lord here as finish I said where there is unbelief I said God cannot do any great work praise the Lord there is UN cannot do any work because inth 13 Matthew 13 if I'm not mistaken 58 Jesus never did any miracle in that point just because of their unise the Lord he did not did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief [Music] the Lord do anything un what Jesus told thews father died in the wilderness because of un praise the Lord so as I I want to finish brother says the prophet [Music] says when that servant had the experience and he saw Chariots of Fire he had an experience and when the experience of God came the prophet says there was no more doubt he fa praise the Lord he got faith there was no doubt in him and what happened he got faith praise the Lord and when he got faith there praise the Lord and another thing he says when you have an experience then it gives fath and Faith goes by your experience praise the Lord that's the prophet Faith goes by your experience praise the Lord so without an experience God can't work praise the Lord can't work so even he says first they come to God and have an experience for salvation before they approach God for their healing before you approach God for the healing you got to have experience with him or it will work wonders if you can only believe praise the Lord there are things which are impossible and to go he has displayed them one day there's a sister in the message I believe in the message expectation uh brother Bram was traveling in air praise the Lord and that old sister that yeah that old auntie I think I'm not mistaken praise the Lord prayed and when she prayed thee come down praise the Lord just imagine if we were outside there is moving first of all do you know that there's a man of God there praise the Lord but this woman is praying where is where is that but he was going and then when the plane met the [Music] prayer had to First reach the prayer and what was that told in a you stand here and she went stood on the there now imagine the time the plane came down she's waiting then the prophet is being told move then is moving is waiting God you told me I Stay there he comes the prophet is moving keep moving is telling the prophet go but where he going there somebody who has requested you there but the prophet didn't know even after that was a strange place for him then at the end of the day the devil came in brother brother you go youil it down because God brought it down it me to come out of it that is [Music] all how I will come back I don't know praise the Lord so there she was going and then she met that the prophet met that woman then he said what you what do you want from me prayed and God showed me he showed me you but you know what was surprising when I read that told the prophet where is the the handbag there's a bag which the prophet had that God showed her person have a bag and then the prophet left it in the car then when he moved he said where is that b the prophet said I left it in thee so that was exactly God answering her then when she had the experience with God she was able to recognize someone who had brought the answer of her praise the Lord praise the Lord at the end of the day works just imagine AE to come down just because of one woman then what ISO we have all of the experience some of them are written of them we are walking them we walking the experience no we walk and we speak experience we breathe experience we act experiences but yet faith in God is another struggle as the prophet said staggering thing to many people and yet it is the foundation found if it is so then and you stand then on top of that on it on top of thatl kindness it other than when all the virtues are on you and then you are wanting to fall because of many things like that reason Foundation maybe was not right so if faith is strong then what can stand against us so having faith in God what will bring only in our Liv praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord so faith in God is the [Music] requirement promise that Christ gave us and he told us have faith that's why you have faith in God what can understand praise the Lord there are things which are impossible very many things which are amen very many things I don't I've always wanted to speak [Music] this people looking for wives it looks impossible is that right yeah it looks impossible when somebody tells you works either way he works here and works on the other there are many things that God did that way God told sister hope behold I send you El God told sister brother go and beat her so God works but without experience it is impossible you [Music] think maybe you are not prayerful it's possible works this side and without experience these are feos what we are talking [Music] are like they are not real if
