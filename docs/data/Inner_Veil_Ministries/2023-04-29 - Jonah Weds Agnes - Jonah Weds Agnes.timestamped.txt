[11:15] the family of our brother you're welcome
[11:18] to have you today
[11:25] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[11:27] Christ we once again want to thank you
[11:30] Lord
[11:31] for this afternoon that you've given
[11:33] unto us alone
[11:35] to be part of this function
[11:38] the wedding of our brother and our
[11:40] sisters
[11:42] we commit ourselves again into your
[11:44] hands
[11:45] we commit the reading of the world
[11:49] we also commit the preaching and the
[11:51] hearing of the world
[11:53] but Lord you may speak to our hearts
[11:57] and Lord you may guide our brothers and
[12:00] sisters
[12:03] today
[12:04] to live a life that will bring Glory
[12:09] when I Love You Lord and we thank you
[12:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[12:36] yet you say wherefore because the Lord
[12:39] has been witnessed between thee and the
[12:43] wife of thy youth against whom though
[12:46] has dealt treacherously yet she is thy
[12:49] companion and the wife of thy covenants
[13:02] and did not he make one yet
[13:06] had he the residue of the spirit and
[13:09] wherefore one that he might seek a Godly
[13:12] seed therefore take it to your spirit
[13:15] and let none deal treacherously against
[13:19] the wife of his youths
[13:38] for the Lord the god of Israel says that
[13:42] he hated putting away for one covereth
[13:45] violence With His Garment says the Lord
[13:48] of hosts they are foretake it to your
[13:51] spirit that you deal not treacherously
[13:58] is
[14:15] I'm not hearing myself well I don't I
[14:17] hope I'm loud enough
[14:21] brother Ben can you hear me okay that's
[14:24] fine
[14:25] praise the name of our Lord
[14:28] so I want to preach on the text
[14:31] and I believe by 3 30 we shall be done
[14:38] I want to preach on the text which says
[14:42] God is a witness in your marriage
[14:48] God is a witness
[14:52] so now the Bible has told us
[14:55] chapter 2 and verse 14.
[15:00] that God has been a witness
[15:05] between Jonah
[15:07] and Agnes
[15:10] praise the name of Allah and then some
[15:13] of us who are married
[15:16] we can also attest to the same thing
[15:20] that God has been a witness
[15:24] between you as a husband
[15:28] your wife
[15:31] God has been a witness
[15:34] praise the name of our Lord God I wonder
[15:38] the way brother Jonah was appreciating
[15:41] ugliness
[15:44] somebody living all the way in Cliffy
[15:49] and then here the girl is living this
[15:51] side
[15:53] how did they meet one another year how
[15:57] did how did they know that maybe there
[15:59] is somebody here yeah
[16:00] [Music]
[16:02] yeah in the cliff there are many sisters
[16:04] over there
[16:06] and then Jonah comes from Mumbai area
[16:11] even invalid there are many sisters
[16:15] and what is interesting
[16:17] Jonah from Mumbai you know
[16:20] has come this way to pick a wife
[16:23] but they are two brothers I can tell you
[16:25] about
[16:27] they have also gone to Mumbai to pick
[16:29] wives from Mumbai
[16:31] then you would start wondering why
[16:34] didn't he Jonah
[16:38] didn't pick from Mumbai
[16:40] and then the brothers coming from here
[16:42] are going to pick from Mumbai
[16:46] praise the name of our Lord so you start
[16:49] wondering why
[16:50] but there is something that God made
[16:54] that even when Jonah is incliffe
[16:58] is not comfortable if he doesn't hear
[17:01] from Magnus who is this side
[17:04] so now you can imagine maybe the first
[17:08] day they met somewhere I don't know
[17:11] oh maybe Jonah was told about Agnes we
[17:14] don't know
[17:17] I didn't get time to find out from them
[17:19] what happened
[17:22] all of women in the whole world why
[17:24] Agnes
[17:27] but God says I want a witness
[17:32] the first day you started imagining
[17:34] about ugness
[17:37] and then you started thinking how can I
[17:40] get her phone number
[17:42] how can I find where she lives
[17:45] all those thoughts
[17:50] I was a witness
[17:53] foreign
[17:56] [Music]
[18:31] foreign
[18:44] [Music]
[19:04] oh if we can meet somewhere
[19:07] and then she gets to know oh you are
[19:10] interested
[19:13] maybe on the phone conversation
[19:16] or text messages
[19:19] God says I was a witness
[19:22] praise the name of our Lord maybe the
[19:24] first time he came to meet the family
[19:26] members
[19:28] to express your interests
[19:31] that you know I'm interested
[19:34] [Music]
[19:36] God says he wants a witness
[19:39] now you see here the Bible has told us
[19:43] that let us take heed
[19:57] yet he had the residue of the spirit
[20:04] that he might seek a Godless
[20:09] therefore take it to your spirit
[20:13] and let none do tarantulas
[20:17] against the wife of his youth praise the
[20:21] name of Allah so the scripture is
[20:25] let us watch out again there is about
[20:29] our human Spirit
[20:32] you know like God has made us
[20:35] you know outside is the body that we are
[20:38] seeing
[20:40] but inside there is a human spirit
[20:44] and that human spirit is what makes this
[20:47] body alive
[20:49] so when a person dies
[20:52] it is the human spirit that lives
[20:56] so you are remaining with the body of
[20:59] the person
[21:00] but then the spirit has left
[21:03] and then you see that just as the body
[21:07] has got five senses
[21:10] [Music]
[21:14] smelling hearing feeling the five senses
[21:19] of the spirit
[22:14] [Music]
[22:20] and then the human spirit
[22:22] got the sense of imagination
[22:29] [Music]
[22:42] now it is now through that human spirit
[22:46] that you start developing feelings for
[22:49] one another
[22:52] praise the name of our Lord so now the
[22:55] Bible is
[22:56] take heed to your spirit
[23:01] because the spirit
[23:04] dictates over the body
[23:08] if the spirit has affection of football
[23:12] um
[23:42] and then he put the logo of money City
[23:45] on the shadow
[23:48] and then now the kid was running away
[23:50] from the shadow
[23:52] but then the logo of Arsenal was on the
[23:55] kid and then the log of money was on the
[23:58] Shadows
[24:02] that one is a real football fan who
[24:05] loves money City
[24:09] because they're imagining things
[24:11] they have affection of these things
[24:14] they are taken by these things and so
[24:18] when you have affection over something
[24:21] then you'll find that you are spending
[24:24] time in that scene with that students
[24:27] like somebody who loves football
[24:29] when they buy a newspaper
[24:33] they don't start from the front they go
[24:36] to the back
[24:37] [Music]
[24:38] these people have not put football
[24:41] when they are listening to the radio
[24:44] for them the time when the news are
[24:46] getting over again
[24:48] all around me today or in the evening
[24:52] they have the passion for it
[24:56] even when they go to this kind of places
[24:59] for films
[25:43] as if he sits in the boardroom to make
[25:46] decisions
[25:48] but he has the affection for that thing
[25:53] now here what comes to marriage
[25:56] you must have affection for your wife
[26:00] you must have affection for your husband
[26:04] foreign
[26:13] [Music]
[26:37] [Music]
[27:04] you know violence
[27:08] or domestic violence over I mean
[27:14] it's not only physical okay
[27:20] you know but there are different forms
[27:23] of violence
[27:26] or abuses
[27:29] but it can be mental
[27:32] you know the way you conduct around
[27:35] you're not you're saying
[27:38] I've never beaten my wife how about
[27:42] mistreating
[27:45] foreign
[28:00] [Music]
[28:06] and you're not being treacherous
[28:08] is your you are devising some techniques
[28:13] or you do something together into a trap
[28:18] but you might remember this happened now
[28:22] this one you're not going to do it you
[28:24] know you are not open from your heart
[28:27] to do what is right to do what is right
[28:31] before the Lord
[28:33] so God says I am a witness
[28:38] praise the name of Allah what your
[28:41] thoughts are
[28:42] what are your thoughts about your wife
[28:46] what are your thoughts about your
[28:48] husband
[28:49] God says I am a witness
[28:53] praise the name of Allah so my brother
[28:56] and my sister as you get into this
[28:59] journey of being married
[29:06] foreign
[30:02] Genesis chapter 10 verse 8.
[30:05] and the Lord said it is not good that
[30:08] man should be alone I'll make him and
[30:11] help meet for him
[30:17] but now when you read in the scriptures
[30:20] in Genesis chapter 1.
[30:23] when the god that made everything
[30:26] he said it is good and at the end of the
[30:30] everything he said and God so that
[30:32] everything is good
[30:35] in Genesis chapter 1 verse 30.
[30:38] and to every beast of the verse 31
[30:41] rather and God saw everything that he
[30:44] had made and behold it was very good and
[30:48] the evening and the morning were the
[30:49] sixth this day
[30:57] praise the name of our Lord God said
[31:00] everything is very good but
[31:03] now when he brings Adam and then he says
[31:07] it is not good foreign
[31:13] thank you
[31:13] praise the name of Allah he says it is
[31:16] not good
[31:20] praise the name of Allah so then you
[31:23] start wondering
[31:26] I will make him a help me
[31:31] now God said it is not good
[31:35] that man should not be alone
[31:42] so he had made the man and man was very
[31:45] good
[31:46] but when he looked at man in the as he
[31:50] had put him together
[31:53] it was not good for that man
[31:57] to be alone now let me ask you a
[32:00] question you mean Adam was alone on us
[32:04] you mean there were no Angels was God
[32:08] not there where animals
[32:13] God was there animals and Adam would
[32:17] give names to the animals
[32:24] but now God was looking for
[32:26] companionship
[32:29] foreign
[32:39] but then we see what's happening in some
[32:42] of
[33:01] God said it's not good
[33:31] there is no better wife you can get than
[33:33] your current wife
[33:38] yes
[33:42] if you are married there is no better
[33:45] husband you can have
[33:48] than your current husband
[33:52] and they should be the same thing with
[33:55] John and Agnes
[33:58] there is no better wife God will never
[34:02] give you the ugliness
[34:06] there is no better houses that God could
[34:10] give you
[34:11] so cherish one another
[34:14] name
[34:16] no wonder what the Bible says Rejoice
[34:19] with the wife of your years
[34:24] don't start looking for another in old
[34:26] age
[34:34] the wife of your use
[34:37] that's what the scripture says he says
[34:40] why have you done treacherously with the
[34:43] wife of your youths
[34:47] and God says I want a witness
[34:52] praise the name of our Lord let us go to
[34:55] the Book of Proverbs
[35:03] Proverbs Chapter 5 Verse 18.
[35:13] praise the name of our Lord five
[35:18] and then 18.
[35:23] he says let thine fountains be blessed
[35:26] and rejoice with the wife of thy youth
[35:30] yes
[35:36] praise the name of Allah he's saying
[35:38] rejoice
[35:40] with the wife of your youth
[35:44] so you see that Adam to get a wife
[35:47] God had to get a portion of his body
[35:52] and even today if one wants to get a
[35:56] wife
[35:57] it's only God who knows who your right
[36:00] person is
[36:05] like the distance our brothers travel
[36:08] those away together
[36:11] maybe it would have been cheaper to get
[36:13] a wife
[36:15] and maybe it would have been easier to
[36:17] get a wife
[36:19] but because you are getting a hell of
[36:23] meat
[36:24] you are ready to count the coast
[36:29] praise the name of our Lord ready to go
[36:32] the last time
[36:33] because you want to get a wife of your
[36:36] years
[36:39] in Proverbs Chapter 19 Verse 14.
[36:44] praise the name of Allah the scripture
[36:47] says
[36:47] house and reaches at the inheritance of
[36:50] fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the
[36:54] Lord
[37:03] praise the name of our Lord houses and
[37:06] riches
[37:08] your parents
[37:12] but if you want a wife go to the make of
[37:16] wives
[37:19] praise the name of our Lord and we don't
[37:21] have a school of wives around
[37:25] praise the name of our Lord so you go to
[37:28] the maker of wise
[37:32] if you want a husband go to the make of
[37:36] husbands
[37:40] so the Bible says houses and riches
[37:46] but to get a Prudent Wife
[37:51] foreign
[38:15] [Music]
[38:31] foreign
[38:55] it's God who was a good husband
[38:58] it's God who has a good wife
[39:00] so if I'm a young woman
[39:04] and I want a good husband
[39:07] I need to be right with God
[39:11] because it's not no gifts so make sure
[39:15] that you are good before because
[39:18] the right person
[39:21] because the Bible says
[39:24] does not get children is food
[39:31] and then he gives it actually to dogs
[39:38] does not get precious powers
[39:42] and he gives it to pigs
[39:46] so you find yourself
[39:49] are you
[39:53] are you food and if you were past
[39:57] you are given to actually the people who
[40:00] value you okay
[40:03] you are given to the children but if you
[40:07] are swine
[40:09] God cannot give you something
[40:12] and the Bible says they will deceive
[40:17] they will also be the same way
[40:21] so the more you deceive welcome more
[40:23] remember the more you get one who is
[40:25] smarter than you to deceive you know
[40:28] so if you are not right
[40:31] you may play being smart
[40:35] until you get a young man or a young
[40:37] woman to be your husband or your wife
[40:41] but then I will get into your house
[40:45] and then you start realizing how did I
[40:49] get you
[40:50] foreign
[41:43] and the universe
[41:46] for a Canada coconut and he answered and
[41:49] said unto them have you not read that
[41:52] that he which made them at the beginning
[41:54] made them male and female the adamant
[42:02] and he said for this course shall a man
[42:05] live father and mother and shall cleave
[42:08] to his wife and they trying shall be one
[42:12] flesh
[42:19] wherefore they are no more trying but
[42:24] one flesh what therefore God has joined
[42:27] together
[42:29] let no man put asunder or whatever
[42:38] and they say unto him why did Moses then
[42:41] command to give a writing of divorcement
[42:43] and put her away
[42:53] and he said unto them Moses because of
[42:57] the hardness of your hearts suffered you
[43:00] to put away your wives but from the
[43:03] beginning it was not so much
[43:16] so Christ is telling us
[43:18] God made them male and female at the
[43:22] beginning
[43:23] and when he made them male and female
[43:27] he joined them they became one flesh
[43:31] change the name of Allah and so now when
[43:35] you are one flesh
[43:37] the Bible has told us God hates putting
[43:42] away
[43:44] God doesn't desire issues of divorce in
[43:48] marriage
[43:51] and that's why you made the voice
[43:54] till death do we pass
[43:57] and now you see when at the beginning
[43:59] when you're starting your marriage
[44:01] because of your love for your wife
[44:05] you will seriously meet me
[44:08] together
[44:10] you are meaning what you are saying but
[44:14] now down there
[44:16] maybe after some years you start looking
[44:20] around for options
[44:24] that's hardiness of heart
[44:26] and the Bible says because of hardness
[44:30] of Hearts
[44:32] no forgiving one another
[44:35] not being kind to one another
[44:38] no bearing with one another then you
[44:41] find a home that was of Love
[44:44] is complaining all the time
[44:56] what a family
[44:59] we need to get rid of hardness of Hearts
[45:03] the Bible says Be Kind to watch one
[45:07] another
[45:09] the book of First Peter chapter 3.
[45:14] praise the name of Allah
[45:25] and then we go and read in verse eight
[45:31] Nana
[45:33] finally be all of One mind having
[45:38] compassion one over another love as
[45:41] Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[46:26] you know there are two words that I read
[46:29] and I was like hey this is interesting
[46:33] this one in verse 7.
[46:36] likewise
[46:39] dwell with your wives
[46:42] now when we're done reading chapter two
[46:45] yeah
[46:48] where we have red so me
[46:54] Mala chapter 2.
[46:57] and then verse 15. he says and they did
[47:02] not make one
[47:04] he had the residue of the spirit
[47:08] where for one
[47:10] that he might seek a Godly seed
[47:14] therefore take heed to your spirits
[47:24] against the wife of his years
[47:27] so in Mala chapter 2 verse 15.
[47:31] is saying don't deal akovanti
[47:35] foreign
[48:03] he says likewise your husbands dwell
[48:07] with your wife
[48:10] you know there is a difference between
[48:12] dealing and dwelling
[48:18] praise the name of our Lord you know to
[48:21] dwell or Cuba
[48:24] you can dread with the chicken cocoa
[48:29] foreign
[48:56] [Music]
[49:46] is because there are some points of
[49:48] weakness
[49:50] there are some points of failure
[49:56] when I'm going to fall down that's when
[49:59] I need yourself
[50:00] and that's why you should stand with
[50:03] your husband and your wife
[50:05] in their points of weaknesses
[50:09] that's being a True Companion
[50:13] what is the name of Allah not looking at
[50:16] a superstar
[50:18] praise the name of Allah maybe a man
[50:21] with a big chest forms
[50:25] and then he said that or now he's my
[50:28] husband
