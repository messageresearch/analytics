[57:58] with the writer ink horn by his
[58:02] side and they went in and Stood Beside
[58:05] the present
[58:09] o there were six
[58:11] men with destroying
[58:14] weapons but among
[58:17] them they were joined by a seventh
[58:21] man who was closed with
[58:24] Lin and with writers inkor by his
[58:29] son and the glory of the god of
[58:33] Israel was G up from the
[58:37] Cherub you know when the Ark of the
[58:42] Covenant uh was uh covered by the
[58:47] M because the masit was the
[58:51] top that covered this I mean Ark of the
[58:55] Covenant
[58:58] and now on this covering
[59:01] here we had two
[59:04] cherubims one on this side one on that
[59:08] side and they had their hands up like
[59:11] that and under them there was the
[59:16] throne amen the Lord Throne was in
[59:19] between
[59:21] the that's why the scripture
[59:24] says God will dwell was among the
[59:28] chab amen but then verse three
[59:32] here the glory of the god of
[59:35] Israel was gone from the
[59:38] Cherub whereon he was to the threshold
[59:42] of the
[59:44] house and he called to the man clothed
[59:48] with
[59:50] linen which had the writers in on by
[59:58] and the Lord said unto him go through
[1:00:01] the midst of the
[1:00:03] city through the midst of
[1:00:06] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:00:09] foreheads of the
[1:00:12] men that sign that cry for all the
[1:00:17] Abomination that's committed in the
[1:00:19] midst
[1:00:26] the Lord that blessing the reading of
[1:00:27] his
[1:00:29] word so for a title this
[1:00:32] morning we are going to
[1:00:36] say the ink Port
[1:00:43] man amen the
[1:00:47] ink and before we take
[1:00:50] time on this particular man of the in
[1:00:56] we need to understand the
[1:01:00] pardon the
[1:01:01] pardon which was done for us by Christ
[1:01:05] on
[1:01:07] C you remember brother Bram telling us a
[1:01:11] story about this young man who was in
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:15] Army and then because he was
[1:01:18] scared he ran away from the front
[1:01:22] line but then he was arrested
[1:01:26] when they arrested him he was taken to
[1:01:30] jail and had to be
[1:01:33] sentenced and the
[1:01:35] Judgment was death when
[1:01:40] convicted but you know this man
[1:01:43] here you know uh uh he he had a
[1:01:49] situation that we are going to look
[1:01:52] at this man
[1:01:54] here uh you know he he was
[1:01:59] pardoned by the president of the
[1:02:03] nation and when he was
[1:02:05] pardoned you know the uh the pardon was
[1:02:09] written on a paper piece of
[1:02:13] paper and signed by a
[1:02:17] president and the Way It Was
[1:02:20] Written was not the normal
[1:02:23] way because it was a crisis
[1:02:27] there was going to be a death by
[1:02:31] firing and the president was fire away
[1:02:34] from his
[1:02:36] office he could not have a presidential
[1:02:40] se but yet he had the authority at the
[1:02:43] same
[1:02:44] time so he wrote the
[1:02:47] pardon and when he wrote the
[1:02:49] pardon this young man
[1:02:52] here amen they took the paper to him
[1:02:56] so that he could uh uh present
[1:03:00] this when the hman
[1:03:03] comes amen the boy looked at it he
[1:03:08] understood the
[1:03:11] procedures amen of how a paron can be
[1:03:14] written by a
[1:03:16] president and the young man looked at
[1:03:20] it he
[1:03:22] trusted and he said don't Mo me
[1:03:26] because I'm going to
[1:03:27] die he threw away the
[1:03:30] PD I want tell you here
[1:03:33] friends but the soldier boy rejected the
[1:03:38] pardon but a pardon can only be taken
[1:03:42] when you ask for
[1:03:45] it and received as and when it is
[1:03:52] given we are called to accept the pardon
[1:03:57] because the scripture says come unto me
[1:04:00] oh
[1:04:01] you and a
[1:04:03] Heavenly and I give you
[1:04:06] rest so a Christian
[1:04:10] basally is called to
[1:04:13] evocation is called for a way of
[1:04:18] life evocation is a
[1:04:22] calling and the way of

[1:04:38] calling you are called into a
[1:04:46] vocation he's the one who speaks that
[1:04:49] language so I can't help you so you are
[1:04:52] called into a way of life
[1:04:55] amen that's Matthew
[1:04:58] 11 and verse
[1:05:01] 29 he says take my yoke upon
[1:05:04] you and learn of me for I am me and L in

[1:06:43] light my Y is calling to a life of
[1:06:48] submission to the leadership of the Holy
[1:06:51] Ghost as a
[1:06:53] Christian in this walk
[1:06:56] we become
[1:06:58] prisoners to the freedom that Jesus has
[1:07:00] bought for
[1:07:02] us are you together with me becoming a
[1:07:06] prisoner to the freedom that Jesus has
[1:07:10] bought for
[1:07:11] us oh praise the
[1:07:14] Lord yes sir it is very wonderful it's
[1:07:19] very precious and we really thank God
[1:07:23] who has bought this freedom for us
[1:07:26] today I want you to say I am
[1:07:31] free amen and in this Freedom you are a
[1:07:35] prisoner into that
[1:07:37] freedom can you imagine being a free
[1:07:42] prisoner amen because Jesus bought that
[1:07:46] freedom for
[1:07:47] you and the chains you
[1:07:51] have and the chains of Freedom you bound
[1:07:55] to any man you are not bound to any
[1:07:59] religion you not bound to any system you
[1:08:03] not bound to a nature of sin because you
[1:08:06] being called to a
[1:08:08] freedom amen I want you to take this
[1:08:11] here
[1:08:12] now that we need to understand the
[1:08:15] pardon that Christ has won for
[1:08:18] us in the book of
[1:08:20] Hebrews chapter 1 and verse three says
[1:08:25] when he had by himself pugged our
[1:08:30] sins he sat down on the right hand of
[1:08:33] the majest on
[1:08:36] high and now this is contrary to the
[1:08:39] annual Feast of
[1:08:44] atonement amen which was done
[1:08:48] every and the blood would expire every
[1:08:52] year and so they have to go back again
[1:08:54] for
[1:08:57] but this
[1:08:58] atonement which was done by
[1:09:01] Christ was done once and for
[1:09:05] all Christ entered into the holy of
[1:09:08] holies
[1:09:09] on and after that he sat down hallelujah
[1:09:15] hallelujah amen why does he sit
[1:09:18] down he's not coming back into atonment
[1:09:23] again he has done it once for
[1:09:26] all and he has entered into
[1:09:29] rest oh praise the Lord and you Happ
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:34] morning he had secured the Redemption
[1:09:37] for
[1:09:39] us and today the finished
[1:09:42] work he sat down
[1:09:47] knowing that we were also going to enter
[1:09:50] into the holy of
[1:09:52] Hol Paul teaches
[1:09:55] that he was accepted for
[1:09:58] us amen he was accepted in the holy of
[1:10:04] holies on our behalf how does he do it
[1:10:08] he takes the sin what kept us out from
[1:10:11] the holy of Hol the
[1:10:14] same which had kept us away from the
[1:10:16] holy of
[1:10:18] Hol and takes it upon
[1:10:21] himself and then gives us his own
[1:10:23] righteousness
[1:10:25] isn't that wonderful so by the
[1:10:29] blood we've got
[1:10:31] access into the holy of
[1:10:34] holies oh praise the
[1:10:37] Lord listen to Hebrews
[1:10:40] 2:4 that through
[1:10:44] death he might destroy him that had the
[1:10:47] power of
[1:10:50] death that's the devil through that
[1:10:54] death
[1:10:55] the devil was impaired against
[1:10:59] you amen he was
[1:11:05] impaired amen and by constant holding C
[1:11:09] before
[1:11:12] us we cannot
[1:11:14] forget that our sins were pged
[1:11:20] away you cannot seee looking at calary
[1:11:25] at
[1:11:26] Calvary Jesus hanged out
[1:11:28] there and every sin of the
[1:11:32] world that was ever
[1:11:34] committed and that was ever going to be
[1:11:37] committed was upon him at the
[1:11:42] at amen and then there was
[1:11:46] Mary Mary the mother of the
[1:11:49] body he was right there watching us all
[1:11:53] the SC
[1:11:55] all the evil all the
[1:11:59] wickedness was flowing toward
[1:12:02] sin he was like a magnet to
[1:12:06] sin amen and all the sin came to
[1:12:10] him the difference between
[1:12:12] him and Adam is that when Adam took the
[1:12:17] sin of his
[1:12:18] wife he had no
[1:12:21] ability to read himself of that
[1:12:24] se that's why people are sinners this
[1:12:28] morning because the nature of man could
[1:12:32] not read of
[1:12:33] se but thank God for
[1:12:36] C hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus Took
[1:12:40] the
[1:12:41] seed he died Hallelujah went into the
[1:12:46] grave in the grave he he went
[1:12:50] again into the into hell and he walked
[1:12:54] into
[1:12:55] there the door opened on its
[1:12:58] own is the master in heaven as is the
[1:13:02] master in
[1:13:03] Hell praise the Lord and when he entered
[1:13:07] out there in the kingdom of
[1:13:10] darkness SL entered in there and he say
[1:13:14] Satan I have brought to you your SE
[1:13:20] hallelujah hallelujah he gave it back to
[1:13:22] Satan that's why you are right
[1:13:26] today because of the work of
[1:13:29] Calvary praise God Amen The Life of
[1:13:34] Christ that constantly builds within
[1:13:38] us reminds us that we are
[1:13:43] pged that we are
[1:13:45] washed that we are
[1:13:47] cleansed that we are
[1:13:50] perfect hallelujah hallelujah because
[1:13:53] God
[1:13:55] backing
[1:13:58] back with what we
[1:14:01] lost the moment you
[1:14:03] accept that father you died for me and I
[1:14:08] thank you for you going to Calvary on my
[1:14:12] beh hallelujah hallelujah once you say
[1:14:16] that then that means you
[1:14:19] accepted that Christ who has taken your
[1:14:23] sin not packing
[1:14:26] I meaning
[1:14:31] you you know his
[1:14:33] righteousness his goodness his Mercy his
[1:14:39] fruitfulness and that's why Peter
[1:14:42] says in second Peter
[1:14:46] 1 but he that lath these
[1:14:50] things amen what things are these these
[1:14:54] are the things which Christ has packed
[1:14:56] us
[1:14:58] with amen after we have been
[1:15:01] forgiven he begins to pack in you his
[1:15:05] own life as virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:15:12] pre godliness impacts those things in
[1:15:16] you but he that lath
[1:15:19] this amen is blind and cannot see a far
[1:15:24] off
[1:15:26] and has forgotten that he was ped from
[1:15:28] his old
[1:15:31] SE so if you are
[1:15:34] packed then your box car is
[1:15:37] [Music]
[1:15:42] packed
[1:15:46] ised amen when you are
[1:15:49] forgiven and you accept that
[1:15:53] pardon not like the other
[1:15:55] boy what does God do he begins to
[1:16:01] pack how many believe in their in their
[1:16:04] pardon
[1:16:06] today a paron is a
[1:16:09] pardon once received as a
[1:16:13] p amen so now God
[1:16:17] himself begins to work upon your
[1:16:21] life to bring you to the state of a
[1:16:23] perfect
[1:16:25] and every step you
[1:16:27] take you thank God for it I have taken
[1:16:31] this now I will take that
[1:16:34] also amen it's God
[1:16:37] himself he's parking
[1:16:40] you praise God therefore the cross
[1:16:44] understood in the right
[1:16:47] perspective is the junction point
[1:16:50] between the two WS
[1:16:56] amen between the
[1:16:59] redeemed and those that reject the
[1:17:02] Redemption simply because they don't
[1:17:05] come from the economy of
[1:17:08] God if you come from the economy of
[1:17:12] God you accept
[1:17:14] everything that God has for you you
[1:17:17] don't look at
[1:17:19] yourself the way you are you begin
[1:17:22] looking at yourself the way God look
[1:17:26] because the die not to make you what you
[1:17:29] think you
[1:17:30] are but to make you what he wants you to
[1:17:34] be amen that's where our success comes
[1:17:38] from it's not in our strength because
[1:17:41] let the weak say I am
[1:17:43] strong that's what we are called to be
[1:17:47] praise God in this walk we become
[1:17:52] prisoners to the freedom that Jesus has
[1:17:55] bought for
[1:17:56] us let's go to Ephesians
[1:18:00] 4 and verse one the holy spirit
[1:18:04] says I
[1:18:06] therefore the prison of the Lord Beek
[1:18:10] you that you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:18:14] where where with you are called
[1:18:26] with all liness and
[1:18:30] meekness with long
[1:18:33] suffering for bearing one another in
[1:18:39] love that's why he saying my yoke is
[1:18:44] light my
[1:18:47] vocation like the calling upon your
[1:18:50] life is I mean is summed up into one
[1:18:54] thing
[1:18:57] humility to the
[1:19:00] word that's all when he says Be You
[1:19:05] holy don't look at what you
[1:19:08] are you just say
[1:19:10] amen and then you walk in is the one who
[1:19:13] knows what is going to do to achieve
[1:19:15] that for
[1:19:17] you so Christianity glows with humility
[1:19:25] the way up is always
[1:19:28] down when we lack the Val of
[1:19:33] humility we can never walk the upward
[1:19:37] way so with this
[1:19:40] background we can go into the
[1:19:43] subject of the inkhorn
[1:19:47] man but even still to understand
[1:19:50] that which begins with Ephesian Ezekiel
[1:19:53] 9
[1:19:56] we still want to drop
[1:19:59] back in eel
[1:20:01] 8 and see
[1:20:04] why God would
[1:20:06] allow amen six
[1:20:09] men destroying weapons to descend upon
[1:20:13] his
[1:20:14] people amen because in Ezekiel
[1:20:18] 8 Ezekiel was seated in a
[1:20:22] house and the Elders of Judah
[1:20:26] amen were sitting before him and
[1:20:30] immediately the hand of God touched
[1:20:32] him and anointed him to ascend into
[1:20:38] prophetic amen he saw a
[1:20:43] likeness as the appearance of
[1:20:46] fire from the appearance of his lines
[1:20:49] even upward I
[1:20:52] downward and from his lines even
[1:20:56] upward as the appearance of the
[1:20:58] brightness as the color of
[1:21:02] amber amen so the go then God takes
[1:21:07] him by the lock of his
[1:21:11] head
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:15] amen he was taken by the
[1:21:19] horn amen and he was hanging Between
[1:21:23] Heaven and Earth
[1:21:26] and while in this
[1:21:28] anointing the Holy Spirit brought before
[1:21:32] him the northern
[1:21:36] gate amen oh praise the Lord which we
[1:21:41] have read about in our
[1:21:44] text in eel
[1:21:46] 9 verse 1
[1:21:49] to4 so let's go to eel 85
[1:21:55] build a
[1:21:56] backround for something
[1:21:59] interesting that God wants to do in your
[1:22:02] life because this morning I believe that
[1:22:06] among
[1:22:07] us there
[1:22:11] is and his commission is to uh uh anoint
[1:22:16] is to
[1:22:20] seal amen those who s for the sin that's
[1:22:23] committed in their
[1:22:27] amen if
[1:22:29] you for the sin committed in your
[1:22:32] city today God is sending
[1:22:38] an praise the Lord eel
[1:22:43] 85 then said unto
[1:22:45] me son of man lift up th eyes
[1:22:51] now the way toward the North
[1:22:55] so I lifted up my eyes that were toward
[1:22:58] the
[1:22:59] north behold northward at the Gate of
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:04] altar this image of jealousy in the
[1:23:16] entry you know it's called the image of
[1:23:20] jealousy amen so the spirit lead seem to
[1:23:24] see the image of
[1:23:27] jealousy at the northern
[1:23:30] gate of the
[1:23:32] temple okay
[1:23:37] anything any
[1:23:39] Idol that a man
[1:23:43] holds amen it causes God to
[1:23:47] jealousy because God says You must not
[1:23:50] have another God beside
[1:23:53] me can not worship another God beside
[1:23:57] me but then just outside of the
[1:24:01] temple the northern gate there was an
[1:24:05] image of
[1:24:09] jealousy we shall understand this image
[1:24:13] of
[1:24:15] jealousy represents or shows the
[1:24:17] Indulgence of the
[1:24:20] people amen as they just walked out of
[1:24:23] the temp
[1:24:26] in the northern Gat what was there
[1:24:31] image amen which
[1:24:34] means that the Life of
[1:24:37] Christ was not being
[1:24:41] lived when the people were outside the
[1:24:44] church there was a fall among the
[1:24:47] people in the church there was a worship
[1:24:52] there praise God
[1:24:54] Hallelujah but outside there the people
[1:24:59] were not standing the way they standing
[1:25:03] chur but still God being long
[1:25:08] suffering kept himself among the
[1:25:12] people ADV could have them
[1:25:17] back are you together with me yeah he
[1:25:21] was still in the
[1:25:22] temple that maybe when when they come to
[1:25:25] the
[1:25:25] temple and they hear from the priest
[1:25:29] something will be said that will change
[1:25:32] them but as they walk out that image of
[1:25:36] jealousy was
[1:25:37] there what makes God jealous in your
[1:25:43] life you have the
[1:25:45] answer so Ezekiel
[1:25:48] 84 and behold the glory of
[1:25:52] God of Israel
[1:25:55] was in there amen according to the
[1:25:58] vision that I saw in the
[1:26:03] plane so God is long
[1:26:07] suffering all the time he goes with you
[1:26:11] all the
[1:26:13] way until you cross the
[1:26:16] line amen I want to tell you something
[1:26:19] here about the longsuffering of God God
[1:26:23] is long
[1:26:24] suffering because in the fall of
[1:26:27] Israel when they rejected
[1:26:30] Joseph he went with them into
[1:26:33] Egypt in his long
[1:26:35] suffering God was right there and one
[1:26:39] day he says I have heard your cry I have
[1:26:43] seen your
[1:26:44] labors God went with
[1:26:47] them when they rejected the ministry of
[1:26:50] Jeremiah he went with them to babyon in
[1:26:54] his long suffering and he sent prophets
[1:26:57] among
[1:26:59] them like Daniel and eel so in this
[1:27:04] Vision God speaks to
[1:27:06] Ezekiel to look
[1:27:09] aside and when he looked
[1:27:11] aside he saw a
[1:27:14] war which the Lord told him Dr that
[1:27:20] wall so that you can see the leadership
[1:27:23] of the Temple
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:28] that
[1:27:29] Temple so he then
[1:27:32] saw they he saw when he drilled that
[1:27:37] Temple he saw how they washed the image
[1:27:40] of
[1:27:43] Jealousy on the other side he also sees
[1:27:47] the
[1:27:47] women were crying to
[1:27:50] tamuz which was a strange God
[1:27:55] so he started seeing strange
[1:27:58] things inside inside and outside of the
[1:28:03] temple where all kinds of
[1:28:07] heathens with men in the
[1:28:10] house and their hearts were turned
[1:28:12] against the altar worshiping the
[1:28:16] sun they were worshiping the
[1:28:19] son are you together with me God was
[1:28:23] revealing
[1:28:25] the hearts of the people in the
[1:28:28] city the people that came to the
[1:28:31] temple the people that came to
[1:28:34] worship and so then when you go into
[1:28:38] eel that's why he
[1:28:41] says get six
[1:28:43] men with destroying weapons because this
[1:28:47] thing here is not what I desire to
[1:28:52] see amen
[1:28:54] that was the
[1:28:56] condition that led the Anor
[1:28:59] man a
[1:29:02] condition amen like that in the days of
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:08] judges after
[1:29:10] Samson when everybody was doing what
[1:29:13] seemed to be right in their
[1:29:17] own and looking at the end
[1:29:20] time is the same condition
[1:29:24] which the church is in people have
[1:29:27] turned their back to the
[1:29:30] altar like they did in that
[1:29:33] time people have turned their backs to
[1:29:35] the
[1:29:36] Cross they have forgotten that their
[1:29:39] sins were
[1:29:41] P they are not allowing God to work
[1:29:46] clean and
[1:29:48] pack we are living in the times of the
[1:29:52] rejection of the pardon again
[1:29:56] because the scripture says in these last
[1:29:59] days he stands at the
[1:30:02] door and he
[1:30:04] knocks behold I stand at
[1:30:08] the If any man hear my voice I open the
[1:30:12] door I come into him and with him and he
[1:30:17] with me oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:21] but has rejected the
[1:30:27] is like
[1:30:30] that is like the days of
[1:30:34] ezel in chapter
[1:30:36] n that's why the holy goost Tes the same
[1:30:43] scripture of the ink
[1:30:45] man when
[1:30:47] brother is going to preach the token
[1:30:50] message
[1:30:55] he picks the same
[1:30:57] scripture of the import
[1:31:01] man because the condition is the
[1:31:05] same the people in church but outside
[1:31:10] church we have not walked like we are in
[1:31:14] church the people have turned their
[1:31:17] backs to the
[1:31:19] Cross they don't care about the tear
[1:31:21] that Christ cried for them
[1:31:25] they don't care when he says he's
[1:31:28] finished they don't care whether he rose
[1:31:31] or he didn't
[1:31:33] R so they just live their life the way
[1:31:36] they want
[1:31:38] to so
[1:31:40] eel there is a I mean is prophetic of
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:46] age of the
[1:31:48] rejection which is the edge of
[1:31:50] L where he says behold I stand at the
[1:31:53] door
[1:31:57] I want to say God is knocking at every
[1:32:01] door
[1:32:04] this
[1:32:06] behold I stand at the
[1:32:08] door God is standing at every door this
[1:32:15] morning so now let's go and analyze eel
[1:32:20] 9
[1:32:22] here he cried also in my ears with a
[1:32:26] loud voice
[1:32:30] saying cause them that have charge over
[1:32:34] the city to draw
[1:32:38] near even every man with his destroying
[1:32:41] weapon in his
[1:32:44] hand because they had rejected the
[1:32:47] message of the
[1:32:49] hour they had rejected the message of
[1:32:52] Ezekiel
[1:32:54] and any form of rejection to the
[1:32:57] world results into
[1:33:00] judgment brother Wilson was preaching
[1:33:03] mercy and then
[1:33:08] judgment amen and doing what seems right
[1:33:11] in our own
[1:33:14] judgment is an
[1:33:16] Abomination because God has put the word
[1:33:19] before
[1:33:20] us you cannot say this also can work
[1:33:25] like I were looking at last
[1:33:27] time because if says this also can
[1:33:32] what and when she got Cain she said I
[1:33:36] got an A man from the
[1:33:39] Lord God does not work with
[1:33:42] Alternatives God works by the perfect
[1:33:45] way amen so we need to keep our eyes on
[1:33:49] the
[1:33:51] word this is causing God
[1:33:54] to come against his own
[1:33:57] people to the extent of disting his own
[1:34:00] Holy
[1:34:09] Temple amen simply because the people
[1:34:12] have not listened to the
[1:34:14] prophet people have not listened to
[1:34:17] Ezekiel people have not listened to
[1:34:20] Malachi people have got their own
[1:34:23] decisions in
[1:34:25] life amen so in verse three says and
[1:34:30] behold six men
[1:34:32] came from the way of the higher
[1:34:36] gate which Li toward the
[1:34:40] North and every man slaugh a weapon in
[1:34:46] his and one man among them was closed
[1:34:50] with l
[1:34:54] with the rightous inkor by his
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:34:58] side and they went
[1:35:01] in understood by the
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:06] present amen so Disobedience the voice
[1:35:10] of the
[1:35:15] word invites
[1:35:18] judgment and we see men coming
[1:35:22] forth with Slaughter
[1:35:25] weapons to judge the Disobedience of the
[1:35:30] people but among
[1:35:33] them there was one man that did not have
[1:35:37] a judgment
[1:35:39] weon hallelujah hallelujah we thank God
[1:35:43] for one
[1:35:44] man who had the fin
[1:35:47] L he did not carry a Slaughter
[1:35:52] weapon this man
[1:35:56] just so this
[1:35:59] therefore makes seven
[1:36:02] men and this seventh one was a unique
[1:36:07] man holding
[1:36:11] an and they all stood by the present
[1:36:16] alt so when the Judgment of
[1:36:20] sin is hitting the ungodly
[1:36:24] I want you to listen to this when the
[1:36:27] Judgment of
[1:36:28] sin is hitting the
[1:36:31] ungodly they will always be the seventh
[1:36:35] man to see what side you
[1:36:41] take if they are judging
[1:36:45] sin they will always be the seventh
[1:36:50] man watching if you are going to jump
[1:36:52] out of the
[1:36:56] he has an that can seal away from the
[1:37:00] oncoming storms of
[1:37:04] judg and the scripture say they all
[1:37:08] Stood Beside the present
[1:37:13] alar praise God and the present
[1:37:19] altar represents
[1:37:21] sin which has already been judged and
[1:37:27] condemned and that's why there was
[1:37:31] somebody that stood
[1:37:33] by amen they were in the
[1:37:37] church but not in the
[1:37:41] world did you hear what I said he
[1:37:45] allowed the men with the slaughter
[1:37:50] weapons to enter into the church
[1:37:53] this man
[1:37:55] Ezekiel was standing between Heaven and
[1:37:58] the
[1:37:59] Earth he was in a
[1:38:01] vision he was seeing things and he was
[1:38:05] seeing that while the people come to
[1:38:09] church they are under
[1:38:11] condemnation they are under the sword of
[1:38:18] judgment and yet at the same
[1:38:21] time God puts a soft voice
[1:38:26] very small still
[1:38:29] voice just one
[1:38:32] man among the six the seventh man still
[1:38:37] Small
[1:38:38] Voice will you come unto me that I give
[1:38:42] you
[1:38:44] rest amen will you come unto me that I
[1:38:48] may deal with your mental health
[1:38:55] because many people have got problems
[1:38:57] with their mental
[1:39:00] health amen you remember I preached that
[1:39:04] sometime people under
[1:39:07] depression they just hate
[1:39:12] everything they just hate
[1:39:14] everything they hate the good they hit
[1:39:17] the back they under tment
[1:39:23] will you come unto me that I may take
[1:39:27] interest will you come unto me that I
[1:39:31] may take you out of
[1:39:33] depression so many people are not happy
[1:39:36] but there is a man here who can change
[1:39:39] the course of everyone's
[1:39:42] life amen praise the Lord Brother Bram
[1:39:47] says BR speaks of
[1:39:50] judgment as is seen in the present
[1:39:54] altar where the pen for sin was met in
[1:39:57] the sacrifice upon the
[1:40:00] altar amen so at this
[1:40:03] time the glory of the Lord was moving
[1:40:07] from the
[1:40:09] chab the SE to the
[1:40:15] threshold are you together with me as
[1:40:18] the men came
[1:40:20] in then Ezekiel Saw the vision
[1:40:24] that now
[1:40:26] death is taking over from
[1:40:30] Life the glory of the Lord is walking
[1:40:34] away from the Master Seat and it was
[1:40:38] going into the
[1:40:41] door that's how the church was there was
[1:40:45] no glory of God
[1:40:47] anymore but the people were always there
[1:40:50] oh Heavenly Father we thank you for Your
[1:40:53] Grace we thank you for your mercy we
[1:40:56] thank you for this we thank you for
[1:40:59] that but while the presence walked
[1:41:04] out the grace of God stayed
[1:41:08] behind Hallelujah the man with
[1:41:13] theor stood
[1:41:16] behind Amen to give Grace to those who
[1:41:21] realize that they need more God in the
[1:41:25] entire in this time where lsia has
[1:41:29] rejected God there still
[1:41:33] is hallelujah who can give Grace to
[1:41:38] those who are thinking different who are
[1:41:42] acting different they don't dress like a
[1:41:45] l they don't
[1:41:48] go they got
[1:41:50] Aire deep down in their heart they why
[1:41:55] God help me I don't want to be what I
[1:41:59] am there is something in them that cries
[1:42:04] against the sin that is committed in
[1:42:07] their
[1:42:09] City amen they
[1:42:14] say for the sin committed in their
[1:42:17] City they've done things that are not
[1:42:20] good from the pop to the people there
[1:42:23] must be a cry in the
[1:42:25] city amen is the cry in the city for the
[1:42:30] sins that committed in the city that
[1:42:33] always brings in The inkor
[1:42:37] Man by your
[1:42:40] side
[1:42:41] amen you see the
[1:42:45] threshold is a
[1:42:47] doorway so as the glory was moving to
[1:42:50] the
[1:42:51] threshold it means that the day of Mercy
[1:42:54] was running
[1:42:57] out
[1:42:59] amen rejected the grace of
[1:43:03] redemption so Ezekiel 9 is just like the
[1:43:07] day of
[1:43:09] lysia where we are
[1:43:12] living no wonder the Holy Spirit took
[1:43:17] the same
[1:43:18] scripture gave it to the prophet and
[1:43:21] preached the token
[1:43:25] by the same
[1:43:26] scripture so where are we living now we
[1:43:30] are living in the days of
[1:43:34] Ezekiel amen so let's go to verse three
[1:43:38] there and the glory of the god of
[1:43:43] Israel was gone up from the
[1:43:47] Cherub whereon he was to the threshold
[1:43:51] of the house
[1:43:54] and he called to the man closed with
[1:43:58] L which had the right
[1:44:07] by so we need to know that brother Bram
[1:44:10] uses these
[1:44:13] scriptures when appealing to
[1:44:16] us in the Quest for the
[1:44:19] token amen so this is a
[1:44:25] scripture that would have I mean that
[1:44:27] worked for I mean for the time of
[1:44:32] eel just like it is working in our
[1:44:36] day when brother Bram is preaching the
[1:44:40] talk it's a compound
[1:44:43] scripture like Matthew
[1:44:46] 2:15 which says out of Egypt have I
[1:44:49] called myself son
[1:44:53] amen and in this
[1:44:56] scripture it is fulfilled in a a double
[1:45:00] way God calling
[1:45:03] Israel out of Egypt
[1:45:06] nation and God bringing back to
[1:45:10] Christ from
[1:45:12] Egypt back to
[1:45:16] Israel after the death of King
[1:45:19] Herod so we can also test
[1:45:24] that the spirit of God is headed
[1:45:29] out from the church into the
[1:45:35] bridge are you together with me he's
[1:45:38] coming out of the
[1:45:40] church into the
[1:45:44] bridge between the seven
[1:45:47] churches and the seals he has walked out
[1:45:52] he's saying come up
[1:45:54] here he's trying to separate us because
[1:45:59] L is under
[1:46:01] judgment the way they think is under
[1:46:05] judgment we should not think like Lord
[1:46:07] this year Lord this your to do its own
[1:46:12] righteous we should think like a
[1:46:15] God because God has given us his own
[1:46:20] righteousness amen joh the
[1:46:24] opening amen of the understanding of
[1:46:28] redemption in Revelation 5 he was told
[1:46:32] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:46:37] has prevailed to lose the seals and open
[1:46:41] the book but when
[1:46:44] John where was the
[1:46:48] judge there was no judge because the
[1:46:51] judge become
[1:46:55] Theon hallelujah hallelujah so why would
[1:46:58] you look for a
[1:47:01] judge why do you look at
[1:47:04] judgment why do you judge
[1:47:06] yourself you see the situation as it is
[1:47:10] the church is in a mess but while it is
[1:47:14] in a mess we thank God he has opened the
[1:47:18] door of the bridge and he has even come
[1:47:21] forth Among Us with
[1:47:24] Anor what is he looking for he's looking
[1:47:28] for a man who will for the sin that's
[1:47:32] committed in the
[1:47:37] city amen so we can also
[1:47:41] testify that the spirit of God has
[1:47:43] headed out into the
[1:47:46] bridge a space of time between the
[1:47:49] church ages and the rolling out
[1:47:53] in Revelation of the Seven
[1:47:56] Seals so in Ezekiel
[1:48:00] 1 which we have dealt with sometimes
[1:48:04] here the work of the Holy
[1:48:07] Spirit was represented by four living
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:14] creatures and scripture inel
[1:48:19] 1 verse
[1:48:21] 19 it says and when the living creatures
[1:48:28] went the wheels went by
[1:48:32] them and when the living creatures were
[1:48:35] lifted up from the
[1:48:37] earth the wheels were lifted
[1:48:41] up hallelujah hallelujah the four living
[1:48:45] creatures was the manifestation of the
[1:48:48] Holy
[1:48:50] Ghost and so they kind of come up in
[1:48:53] form of a
[1:48:56] ring and then the Holy Spirit
[1:48:59] again formed the church in the same
[1:49:03] way that now it was a wheel in a
[1:49:08] wheel the whe of the four living
[1:49:13] creatures and the whe of the seven
[1:49:17] churches a wheel in a wheel and they
[1:49:20] kept moving together they were locked
[1:49:23] together they were permanent
[1:49:26] locked Hallelujah hallu but when the
[1:49:30] living
[1:49:32] creatures which is the Holy Ghost was
[1:49:35] lifting
[1:49:37] up even the
[1:49:39] wheel on the earth which is the church
[1:49:44] was lifted up together
[1:49:47] with
[1:49:49] friends if this is what God is doing
[1:49:53] is latter than we
[1:49:55] think because the
[1:49:58] threshold is right
[1:50:00] there and the glory of God is moving out
[1:50:05] moving out moving
[1:50:10] out it's the will of
[1:50:12] God and the desire of God that we cry
[1:50:18] for the sin committed in the
[1:50:20] city and we get joined to the wheel
[1:50:26] that when the glory goes
[1:50:28] out it doesn't just go
[1:50:31] anywhere it's the time for the
[1:50:37] rupture amen that's where it
[1:50:40] goes so currently the spirit of
[1:50:44] Christ can put up with abom cannot put
[1:50:47] up with the Abominations in lodia
[1:50:53] so he moves from the church into the
[1:50:56] bridge come out over my
[1:51:00] people come out of her come out of
[1:51:07] L now the funny
[1:51:10] thing is that the
[1:51:15] church is not
[1:51:18] realizing what God is
[1:51:21] doing if you realize what God is
[1:51:25] doing then we would always
[1:51:28] weep for any little thing you begin to
[1:51:32] weep weep for the sin committed in the
[1:51:36] city the bad feeling you have about a
[1:51:40] brother cry that it goes away that kind
[1:51:45] of whatever attitude you have C that it
[1:51:49] goes away amen you cry for the sin
[1:51:53] committed in the
[1:51:55] city because these people were in the
[1:51:59] church but God just lifted up
[1:52:03] Ezekiel H in between the Earth and
[1:52:06] heavens and says look at your people
[1:52:10] when they walk out of church look at the
[1:52:13] image of jealousy look at what they get
[1:52:17] involved
[1:52:21] God so
[1:52:25] verse four and the Lord said unto
[1:52:29] him
[1:52:31] now this is
[1:52:34] interesting go through the midst of the
[1:52:37] city through the midst of
[1:52:40] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:52:43] foreheads of the men that
[1:52:46] side and cry for all the
[1:52:51] Abominations that done in the midst
[1:52:54] thereof this being a compound
[1:52:58] scripture the holy ghost is now applying
[1:53:02] the
[1:53:04] token upon his people and is calling his
[1:53:08] bride out of
[1:53:11] organization into the bridge to be
[1:53:16] sealed till the of
[1:53:20] redemption he's calling
[1:53:23] and
[1:53:25] friends it's latter than we
[1:53:28] think there's something that brother
[1:53:30] Bram
[1:53:32] said this is the message identification
[1:53:35] of Christ in all
[1:53:39] ages he was talking about
[1:53:45] 1964 when
[1:53:47] the uh earthquake hit on a good Friday
[1:53:55] it says the Earth shaking all
[1:53:59] over with
[1:54:01] earthquakes why the first time the
[1:54:05] earthquake ever shook the whole
[1:54:11] earth was on a good
[1:54:14] Friday the last time it shook
[1:54:17] it was another good
[1:54:19] friend shaking the w
[1:54:22] what did it shake for because they had
[1:54:25] rejected their
[1:54:27] Messiah why did it shake
[1:54:29] again they've done the same
[1:54:35] thing are you together with me when
[1:54:38] Earth was
[1:54:40] dark and Earth was under
[1:54:46] Tremor says why they had rejected the
[1:54:49] Messiah
[1:54:53] and he says again
[1:54:56] 1964 on a good
[1:54:59] Friday why did the earthquake
[1:55:02] Shake he says they had done the same
[1:55:04] thing they rejected Christ the person
[1:55:09] 1964 they rejected Christ in the opening
[1:55:12] of The Seven
[1:55:15] SE are you together with me they had
[1:55:18] rejected him in the opening of the war
[1:55:23] Christ had stepped forward to open those
[1:55:26] Seven
[1:55:27] Seals but how many people took
[1:55:32] it the glory of the Lord has since
[1:55:36] started moving out of the you know
[1:55:38] through the
[1:55:41] threshold and outside of the
[1:55:45] threshold
[1:55:46] behold amen outside of the
[1:55:50] threshold is now re
[1:55:54] 4 verse one the calling out of the
[1:55:58] Bride out of the church into the
[1:56:02] bridge praise God the church is
[1:56:06] everything but the bride is the chosen
[1:56:10] lady the elect lady we're looking at
[1:56:14] yesterday she has been called
[1:56:17] out amen called out for what to be given
[1:56:21] the stat of the perfect man to come into
[1:56:25] the status of
[1:56:28] gas amen John looked at him and says
[1:56:32] I've loved him in
[1:56:34] truth we are growing into
[1:56:41] that
[1:56:43] amen sometimes you will not even know
[1:56:45] you are
[1:56:47] growing but you are
[1:56:50] growing that's what Mark 4
[1:56:54] says you can
[1:56:56] look but you can never see the SE taking
[1:57:00] one
[1:57:02] mm I thank God that all of you
[1:57:07] are amen you are
[1:57:10] growing and let the weak
[1:57:13] say I am strong how many are strong this
[1:57:17] morning I'm one of them amen so and
[1:57:22] after this I
[1:57:24] looked for verse one and behold the door
[1:57:28] was opened in
[1:57:33] heaven 4 verse
[1:57:38] one amen and the first voice which I
[1:57:41] heard was as it where the trumpet
[1:57:43] talking with
[1:57:50] me come up here
[1:57:56] and I show the things which must be
[1:58:01] herea where are we we in the come
[1:58:06] up and what is there we are listening to
[1:58:10] the prophetic
[1:58:12] voice of Malachi 4 the message of the
[1:58:17] hour amen you are being called
[1:58:20] out and you are moving into
[1:58:25] circuit amen of Psalms
[1:58:30] 91 Amen in verse one he says he that
[1:58:35] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:58:39] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:58:45] almighty say the
[1:58:47] Lord is my
[1:58:50] refuge and my Fortress
[1:58:53] my God in him will I
[1:58:56] trust that's why is collecting his
[1:58:59] children putting them into the
[1:59:03] bridge putting them before prophetic
[1:59:07] message pulling them
[1:59:09] out and putting them in a
[1:59:13] presence so that he can shine some of
[1:59:18] them amen it's a seing Time
[1:59:23] for those who die for the Abomination
[1:59:25] that committed
[1:59:27] in it's now
[1:59:30] time that the inkhorn
[1:59:32] man would start taking
[1:59:36] elect through a sealing
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] process sealing
[1:59:45] process amen and once you are
[1:59:49] sealed you are sealed in
[1:59:53] and then everything is sealed
[1:59:56] up because brother Bram T us about the
[2:00:00] box
[2:00:04] car that's what he called The Box
[2:00:08] Car you know he puts all the package he
[2:00:11] wants in
[2:00:13] there faith and virtue and knowledge
[2:00:17] Temperance the very Life of Christ and
[2:00:20] the Fruit of the Spirit he looks in
[2:00:23] there and then seales
[2:00:26] it you may not even know that it's
[2:00:30] there until the challenge
[2:00:33] comes Hallelujah that's when you know oh
[2:00:38] my box was
[2:00:41] seal amen everything that I need for the
[2:00:45] journey God has already put it on the
[2:00:49] inside you only know it's there
[2:00:52] when you come into the time of
[2:00:56] challenge there is a special
[2:00:59] Grace that comes down here and that
[2:01:03] Grace is God himself he picks out a v
[2:01:06] you need at a certain
[2:01:12] time and you bear the
[2:01:15] fruit you may not know that you are a
[2:01:17] very kind
[2:01:20] man until challenge
[2:01:23] comes then you'll discover
[2:01:26] oh when I saw the brother I couldn't
[2:01:30] stand
[2:01:31] it and the people know you are
[2:01:39] mean but the
[2:01:41] challenge is what produces that
[2:01:46] life praise the Lord amen so the moment
[2:01:51] we the
[2:01:52] moment we are justified by
[2:01:56] faith at the foot of the
[2:02:09] pyramid praise the Lord so he declares
[2:02:13] us
[2:02:15] justify we receive what Paul calls the
[2:02:18] spirit of adoption
[2:02:22] meaning that we receive a Divine
[2:02:26] Life that helps us to grow into our
[2:02:29] personal
[2:02:33] adoption so God
[2:02:36] seed must come through the hands of the
[2:02:40] tutor before that
[2:02:42] adoption to lead us through our
[2:02:45] Christian
[2:02:46] experiences to lead us through our
[2:02:49] trials to help us di
[2:02:55] our are you together with me amen why
[2:02:59] don't you thank
[2:03:00] God Amen while the destroying angels are
[2:03:06] here there is a man with
[2:03:09] in just at your
[2:03:12] side Hallelujah you happy with that
[2:03:16] because he knows you are
[2:03:18] fighting you s you sigh
[2:03:23] because many people said do you think I
[2:03:24] have the Holy Ghost
[2:03:26] me you do you say you cry is not your
[2:03:32] joy to live in
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:36] sin you
[2:03:38] cry and the reason why you cry is
[2:03:42] because you have got the spirit of
[2:03:45] adoption that spirit will lead
[2:03:48] you all the way to your adoption he's
[2:03:52] not going to leave you in the
[2:03:54] wilderness he cross with you the Red Sea
[2:03:58] he go through the experiences of the
[2:04:00] Wilderness he cross with you the Jordan
[2:04:04] until you come to your position in
[2:04:07] Christ amen yes sir so let's look at
[2:04:12] this in Romans chapter
[2:04:20] 8 for as many as are led by the spirit
[2:04:24] of God they are the sons of
[2:04:32] God for you have not received the spirit
[2:04:35] of bondage again to
[2:04:41] fear when you were Bound in sin you were
[2:04:46] scared you fear hell you fear judgment
[2:04:52] everything but the spirit of
[2:04:56] adoption comes and picks you
[2:04:59] up in the condition of sin and
[2:05:04] unrighteousness when you
[2:05:06] s and you say father upon me at the
[2:05:11] stage of
[2:05:13] justification he picks you
[2:05:16] up and walks with
[2:05:19] you you think he doesn't nowh he wants
[2:05:22] to take
[2:05:23] you he wants to take you to the state of
[2:05:26] the
[2:05:28] perfect he walks with you as the word is
[2:05:32] being preached you are being cleansed
[2:05:35] you are being washed don't reject the
[2:05:39] word don't be negative to the word
[2:05:42] because that's your
[2:05:44] cleaning when comes to you it's
[2:05:47] Awakening you to a of need
[2:05:52] amen he's only pointing at this and then
[2:05:56] you begin to say heavenly father
[2:05:59] Heavenly Father you cry for it the token
[2:06:03] comes over and he says okay I'll take
[2:06:05] you another
[2:06:07] level we are going to make it friends is
[2:06:10] one step at a
[2:06:12] time and I've always told you that a
[2:06:16] normal
[2:06:17] person walks on one leg
[2:06:23] that's what it is you don't walk on two
[2:06:26] feet you can't make
[2:06:28] it you walk one foot at a time you take
[2:06:32] one step at a time that's a normal man
[2:06:35] if God takes you into a
[2:06:37] stage thank him for that
[2:06:40] stage and when he has done that it means
[2:06:44] it's going to take you another stage one
[2:06:47] by one we shall
[2:06:49] walk until we shall come
[2:06:52] to the stat of a perfect man is that
[2:06:55] eval promised to you is that ev's
[2:06:59] promise to
[2:07:00] you no it's the Father's Promise if it
[2:07:04] was my promise it would fail but that's
[2:07:08] his promise for you that you are going
[2:07:10] to make the state of a perfect
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] man amen praise the Lord for you have
[2:07:19] not received the spirit of bondage to
[2:07:23] fear but you have received the spirit of
[2:07:26] adoption which CH AB
[2:07:30] father father when we come down here you
[2:07:34] see people lift up their hearts
[2:07:36] everybody's AB father father AB father
[2:07:41] he I have a problem AB father God
[2:07:44] listens to those prayers even if they
[2:07:47] are coming from the weak spirit
[2:07:51] amen that's the spirit of adoption he
[2:07:55] drops him to help
[2:07:59] us in the stage of
[2:08:01] justification because we could not in
[2:08:04] any way justify
[2:08:07] ourselves it's the Holy Spirit from the
[2:08:11] beginning so the spirit of adoption
[2:08:14] then helps us to catch the
[2:08:18] Revelation that we are sons of God
[2:08:22] and he's our
[2:08:23] father and that our
[2:08:26] sunship is not outside here on the
[2:08:30] co but it's the Gen seed of God on
[2:08:35] the oh Hallelujah the genene SE friends
[2:08:40] I said the
[2:08:41] gene the gene of God on the side when
[2:08:45] Christ came into the
[2:08:47] flesh Jesus
[2:08:49] grew in sture
[2:08:52] wisdom and then also in favor with
[2:08:56] men and when he comes into my
[2:08:59] soul Jesus begins to
[2:09:08] grow hallelujah hallelujah my growth is
[2:09:11] not
[2:09:13] me my growth is Christ in me it begins
[2:09:18] to
[2:09:19] grow brother Bram calls it light as
[2:09:22] small as a
[2:09:25] Buton but it begins to grow cring out
[2:09:29] all the
[2:09:34] darkness praise the Lord amen so the
[2:09:38] Revelation breaks
[2:09:40] forth that you are a gene of his
[2:09:43] Gene and that when he became Flesh and
[2:09:47] Blood he was coming to redeem us from
[2:09:50] the Trib of SE
[2:09:54] amen we know who we are and we shall
[2:09:57] judge
[2:09:58] ourselves by The Obedience of the seed
[2:10:01] gen on the
[2:10:05] inside amen the inner man has no
[2:10:09] pleasure in a life of sin he SI
[2:10:16] on you
[2:10:18] s you see you get home you are not happy
[2:10:22] you said something here you did
[2:10:25] something there you are down on your
[2:10:27] knees and you are saying ABA

[2:16:49] sanctifies
[2:16:51] he takes the word to expose every
[2:16:54] weakness of your human
