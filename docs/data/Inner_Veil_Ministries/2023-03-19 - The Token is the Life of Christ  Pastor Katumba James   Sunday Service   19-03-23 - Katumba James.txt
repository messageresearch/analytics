afternoon service will be for married people I always praise the name of our Lord so I would encourage all the married people to attend I remember when we didn't have these meetings you know people are raising we need to have married people's meetings now when we started the married post meeting there are some married people who are habitually okay I present themselves and then you start wondering praise the name of our Lord let us not be like children in the marketplace when they got their friends is too much we started whipping when they started whipping they didn't do anything so when God gives us an opportunity for anything it's always good for us to receive it praise the name of Allah it's for our goodness destruction may not be the best in your family but what is spoken in

father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we want to thank you for this morning give praise to your Holy Name Lord that you have made a way for us father a way to overcome the way to be righteous be your children they were to be covered in the blood of Jesus for the great salvation a free gift Lord not that we deserved it by grace that we are served we are so thankful foreign you've been watching over and the Lord spoken to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be until the beginning of months it shall be the first of the year to you [Music] speaking all day speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every money lamp according to the house of their fathers and a lamp for an house number and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamps your lamb shall be without blemish a man of the first year you shall take it out from the ship or from the gods foreign and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take off the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in the dark night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it it not of vitro nor a sudden all with water but lost with fire his head with his legs and with the partners they are on them and you shall let nothing of it remain until morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire now and that shall you eat it with your loins guarded your shoes on your feet and your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord this Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I'll Smite all the first born in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the Lord and the blood shall be for a token upon the houses where you are when I pass when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt is [Music] so here God was taking the children of Israeli from the land of Egypt to the land of promise praise the name of Allah and then here what the scripture tells us to cover he told them to take a lamb for a house or if there are few they can combine themselves and then he says when you take this lamp it should be blameless so then he says and then you keep it praise the name of Allah in Exodus chapter 12. and then verse 3. he's saying speaking unto all the children Congregation of the children of Israel saying that in the 10th day of this month they shall take unto them every man alone and then the condition of the Lamb that was to be blameless they were meant to keep that lamp up to the 14th and you shall keep until the 14th day of December and the whole assembly of the congression of Israel shall kill it in the evening so then you see that the conditions the condition of being blameless was on the lamb was on the sacrifice praise the name of our Lord and then he had the Bible tells us in Psalms chapter 51. that we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and then Romans chapter 3 and then in verse 23 praise the name of Allah you know for all have sinned and become short of the glory of God so now what God requires of us is to take the perfect lamb and when we take the perfect life then we also become perfect was not on the people equivalent to rather the blamelessness was required on the land was required on the sacrifice praise the name of Allah so we see that our Lord Jesus Christ is the name of our Lord and we see our Lord Jesus Christ was also put among the whole of critics you know to check him in everything he went and appeared before the high priest [Music] but then we should not look about the Old Testament of the false Witnesses and our false Witnesses and Satan will always be there until he's Bound for a thousand years but we shouldn't look at the testimony of the false Witnesses we should look at the testimony of Jesus Christ now I want us to go to some chats here on slide 13 if we can put it there just talk about the lamb and applying the blood no questions there are some church which you want us to look for pictorial what do I need for an event you know where you know they were slaying the lamps and then they had to draw the blood can make it now you see here they were actually you know slaughtering or cutting cutting drawing cutting the neck of the lamp burning outside and then they were drawing this blood is now when this was done in the evening now when they got this Blood the scripture says they had to apply it on the door on the two sides of the door that's this sideaku they had to apply it on this idea and then this idea and then the upper here covering with the blood we got the next one you see that the blood was on the top post and then on the post on the side that's what they were doing praise the name that's what they were doing that was in the Old Testament thank you but then you see that in the Old Testaments they were using animal blood and now the Animal blood animal life praise the name of Allah and the animal life could not come back to the worshipers now in the message the prophet says and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church that is slide number four this is the evening time for me this is the evening time for my message I'm dying I'm going ninja I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied I told you last Sunday I had something I want to talk to you about this is it you know the time that when you just can't play with it so the prophet is telling us they were those children of Israel the way they were in Egypt death was roaming to come over the land so there was nothing like playing games and it is also the same thing to us now for us the blood is not applied on the door but the blood has to be applied to our house to be applied to ourselves then he says if it is ever going to be done it is going to be done now because we can see that the Wrath is about ready to pass through them and everything from under the token will perish has identifies you know for the animal alive would not come back on the human beings when the blood was shared the life went out because it was a unit and when life's blood was gone from it the life being different from the blood the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different could not come back upon a human life because it didn't have a soul the soul is the nature of the life therefore it had no certain nature it was an animal therefore the blood stood for a token that the life had been given to everyone but in this glorious place there is a difference between the blood and the life they're talking foreign slide 15. okay combinator praise the name of our Lord and you know in that slide right they put the blood on the door praise the name of Allah but now we need to get the blood let us go the last slide now we see our Lord Jesus Christ too when he was on the cross he shed his blood praise the name of Allah he shared this black and when he shared his blacks his life went out of him praise the name of Allah his life went out of him now let us go to John chapter seven praise the name of our Lord John Chapter 7 and then we read in verse 37 to verse 39 so much in the last day that great day of the fifth Jesus stood and cried saying if any man says let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his Berry shall flow rivers of Living Water yes praise the name of our Lord so he was saying if you are thirsty and I believe we are all fasted this morning praise the name of our Lord and then we've come to drink from the Fountain of Living Waters and this Fountain is rivers of Faith rivers of goodness all coming out of you because you have been connected to the living fountains I've also become a fountain and then the river foreign [Music] but this is spunk of the spirit Mario which they that believe on him should receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified now so you see here the Bible says that down Holy Spirit was not yet given because the Lord Jesus and Resurrection in other words he had not shared his blood and now when he shared then the life that was in the blood came back on the day of pension when Jesus died on the cross he released his life and the life of Jesus Christ is the Holy Spirit glory be to God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] let us go to Romans chapter 3. praise the name of our lord they're talking today is the life of Jesus Christ so the question is do you have today's tokens do you have the life of Jesus Christ do you have the spirit of God you know praise the name of Allah so Romans chapter three and then verse 35.30 later started from verse 23. 3 23. but all I've seen and come short of the glory of God foreign being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be the appropriation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God is the name of our Lord so the Bible says for all I've seen that was the nature we had when we came here on Earth our first nature our nature from the first Adam was a sinful nature foreign foreign foreign he was offering for our sins now when we go back to Romans and then verse 25. the Bible says God that sent forth a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins through the forbearance of God when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal assistant you repent of your sins and when you repent of your sins the Bible says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name your failures of everything foreign Hebrews 9 15. the Bible says and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance so the Bible is telling us went and removed all the sins in the first testament and the first testament is the only instruments went and picked the sin of Adam and Eve in the garden and then it came forward and then it goes until we are talking about the blood of God foreign it is not complicated praise the name of Allah let us go to that chart which is in a table Katrina praise the name of our lord it's not complicated there is a chat in tabular form we want to refer to that and see you can imagine fighting also made so in this church [Music] there is justification sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to go to that chat please so there is justification sanctifications and now when you see all this sanctification Gamble [Music] praise the name of Allah you'll see that to be Sanctified you needed the black which I go inside to be Sanctified you need the Holy Ghost to be Sanctified you need the word wait I'll get you gamble foreign Romans chapter 5 and verse it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ so you cannot have faith without them hearing the words so when you hear the words the word motivates your heart to have faith and then you say Lord I believe and then when you accept it you are Justified praise the name of Allah your sins are taken away so then you see that you need the word to be justified you can't be justified but yet at the same time as you receive the word the word praise the name of Allah let us go back to the church praise the name of Allah as you receive it it is the spirit of God that is praise the name of Allah it is the spirit of God that is so when the spirit convicts you in first Corinthians chapter this one here first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 11. praise the name of our Lord First Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 11. the Bible says and such were some of you being washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of Our Lord is so the Bible is telling us the spirit justifies us and so here you've heard the word Gamble and the word of God praise the name of Allah brother Branham tells us in the message let us go there praise the name of our Lord in the message talking he says now we also find in Hebrews chapter 12 and then verse 24. that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word praise the name of Allah so he says the blood speaks the blood has got a voice what is the voice of the blood it is the word became the life of God in the world and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of this prostitute praise the name of Allah so the Bible tells us in the beginning was the one whenever the world and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then in John 1 14. that word in its conditions that word put on flesh and when they were the blood the word put on flesh in flesh forms foreign [Music] let us go back to the child foreign but when you hear the words you're applying the blood when you believe the word the spirit in the world brings conviction and justifies you yeah gambo and the face look weakness is not complicated when you have faith in the world let us got the message time tested faith is that face in the Old Testament was the same way in the New Testament so many people stumble at the thought of Faith but it is so simple we know to have faith how many believe that it is so simple you have faith how many believe that do you know how simple it is because you left your home and reached here at church how many are not going back home today now if you don't have that doubt so why don't you have faith for your full salvation praise the name of our Lord but you even believe you told the Neighbors at this time I will be back sorry and I will be doing this question uh tomorrow I have a lot of assignments praise the name of Allah wants us to have friends it is so simple we know the Bible says he that started the good work my question is has it started The Good Wife then why don't you allow with it praise the name of Allah he that started the good working yesterday to bring it to completion praise the name of Allah the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 12 and then verse looking unto Jesus you cannot move out of yourself foreign [Music] what are you using faith praise the name of our Lord do you think when you reach there you will not be able to come back you have that faith that sounds simple so even our Salvation you've accepted the Lord as your possible you have been Justified allow him to sacrifice allow him to feel it what God requires from us praise the name of us and then he says you cannot put your heart on again unless you have faith you can do it never can you draw out your breasts unless you have faith you can do it that sounds simple faith and then it continues it's so common yeah is foreign dipped in the blood and rubbed over the door isop is just common with and that is how it was applied by ISO something you could just reach down anywhere and get a handful of it foreign foreign before providing it but he provided it then he demanded it because he knows you can get it oh it's all for now praise the name of Allah he didn't ask them for the holidays so you go and receive the house praise the name of Allah you know in John chapter 7 verse 39. the Holy Ghost was not yet given but now I'm asking you has the Holy Ghost been given or not yet given um foreign Jason are you going to get the whole lake of water to bring that kind of thing and God told him you will see it now Moses was wondering how is this going to be you know but God did it anyhow and so what happened when God sent the quails the Bible says they were flying one and a half Cubit a meeting not even a meter to beat um is about one and a half feet from here so one and half was like from me up to here let me ask you a question which person cannot pick it when it's flying at that level which person cannot pick it and that's how God has given us all these things is if he requires it he brings it near you praise the name of Allah so that's why brother brand name is Faith is common into your quick it is so you see that to be justified you needed the word you need the same word it's the blood no I'm sorry and that same word to be sacrificed let us go back to that church to be sacrificed it is foreign [Music] you need praise the name of Allah the church is purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ you need the Holy Ghost now let us go to John chapter 3 verse 5. praise the name of our Lord John chapter 3. and then verse 5. the Bible says Jesus answered very very I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into this kingdom of God yes now that water is the word praise the name of Allah and then the spirit is the Holy Spirit so you need the water with agama be you need the word the spirit you need the word wait I guess gamble you need the spirit but how do you get that if not yeah there is not a different Basin for water is not a different Basin for the world and there is not a different Basin for the spirit it is foreign First Corinthians chapter 12 13 so the Bible says for by one spirit all baptized body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spiritual participate praise the name of our Lord so he says by one Spirit a holy spirit so the holy spirit that justifies the same holy spirit that sanctifies you let us go to First Peter chapter 1 verse 2. praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter 1 verse the scripture says according to the foreign knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit and to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied praise the name of Allah so you see here that he sanctifies Us by his spirit and make my above is the complications foreign yeah but you have received the spirit of adoption calling us the children of God that's what we have received praise the name of us so the spirit of God is much near you as much as you cannot obey the word of God so if you can obey the world when Peter was speaking this word where was the Spirit come down it is the same principle now that if we can received the same word of God the same word of God praise the name of us when he got that man who was beaten to death he gave him he took him to the Inn yeah and then he gave the minister he didn't give him three praise the name of Allah he gave him two pence one is the word and the other is the spirit so as long as you can receive them you can also receive this that's what we come to church too so you are in the right environment you are in the right place to be born again it is not complicated but then you see somebody running from this job going into another church as long as you can receive the word the Holy Ghost is there almost for everyone coming to yourself as long as you can obey the words your obedience to the world that's good to Acts chapter 5 and verse 23. praise the name of Allah Acts chapter 5. and then read the verse 32. he says and we Are Witnesses of these things by hearing the words God has given them the Holy Spirit how difficult is that it's not difficult we just need to obey the word of Twitter and then the Holy Ghost comes down now let us go in the message he says the New Testament means new confidence the blood life itself is the token the life out of the blood is the token remember in the Old Testament the actual blood of the lamb um it is the token of the blood now it is the life from the blood and that is in the person for the token the new token is the new life that comes through Jesus Christ when his blood was shared a child and fill it with his presence that he might manifest his word and his promises to the people so they're talking now is the life of Jesus Christ how do you receive the life of Jesus it's not difficult accept the Lord as your personal assistant will start growing in you that's not difficult as we've been looking at that chat I'm compared to go back to it foreign you see that in this church you know justification you need the word sanctification let us go to First Peter chapter verse 23. foreign being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever um so the Bible says we are born again by the word of God that's the scripture the new birth comes Freedom by the word of God now the new birth coming by the word of God it's not different from the New Birth because I work without coming by the baptism of the holidays it's not different the issue is if you are born by the word how far is the word from you what is the line a problem keep on obeying the word when the spirit comes down in other words you are accepting the life in the world praise the name of us so it's not complicated foreign so if it is going to rain let the word be there let the word be in our hearts then the Holy Ghost keeps on coming anointing that word giving that word you know ability to grow and then you are able to have the life of Jesus Christ is the life of Jesus Christ that's what we should desire don't run for emotions and that's the problem we have we don't want to run for this emotions the Holy Ghost is suffering you can have emotions but it's the same holy ghosts praise the name of Allah when he Saul was anointed he prophesied when David was anointed prophesy the anointing of Soul be more powerful than the anointing of damage you can read the scriptures praise the name of our Lord let us go there in the book of Us Praise the name of Allah in the book of First somewhere I just want to get that scripture first somewhere somewhere like soccer let us go to First Samuel chapter 15. first Samuel chapter 16 rather and then verse 13. then someone took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the Middle East of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel arose up and went to Rama Adidas yo upon his head and kissed him and said it is not because the Lord has anointed me to be Captain over his inheritance and when thou art departed from me today then Thou shalt find two men by Rafa SEPTA in the border of Benjamin at Zelda and they will say unto thee the asses which though went to seek are found and law thy father has left the key of the asses and Sorrows for you saying what shall I do for my son one of us and the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shall be turned into a new another person foreign let us go there praise the name of Allah Acts chapter 9. and then we read from verse 17. and ananyas went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Soul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto me in the way although cometh has sent me that though might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy ghosts um and immediately they are fell from his eyes as he had been scales and received the sight forthworth and arose and was baptized among ago UMass praise the name of our Lord so ananias was sent to lay his hands on Souls received two things receive his side and to receive his holy now when ananias laid his hands on Souls the Bible says the eyes foreign foreign Ty of God is the life of Jesus Christ do you have the life of Jesus is that life in you praise the name of us now in the message wisdom but his face into a magazine he says but Faith only has one thing life that's all that will say Thy word is true he is Faith only hangs right there that's right and won't take it holy spirit that's why our faith grows in our quick results that's the only place that faith can work is When Faith hears the wife and believes that it is it produces from what the word says how did he make the world do you believe the world was in goodness how did he make it yeah and that's what we are here this morning God speaks his wife we received that word then we become the manifestation of the world in the beginning God created in Genesis and then the Bible why did you call foreign foreign [Applause] foreign God let us go to Colossians chapter three and then verse Colossians as I try to wind up if you build risen with Christ sitteth on the right hands set your affection on things above not on the things on the earth Brothers for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God foreign let it be no longer you but let it be Christ to Christ becoming our being Christ taking over all our lives no longer I that living but Christ that leaves praise the name of it Colossians chapter 2 verse six as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him yes so if you have received Christ Walk In Christ you know let Christ be what you are in look at please he has taken over your thoughts he has taken over your speech he has taken over your your actions let him be everything don't limit himself but even at your places even the places where are you staying even the places where you study foreign [Music] let us continue with him in baptism wherein also you are risen we of God who has raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses foreign verse 13. so now he says we are buried with him in baptism then we are raised with him so we live with him so then if you have buried your old nature you need to raise in the newness of Christ his life you live in the spirit no longer but the Christ taking over your life you need to live in Christ is the Life of Christ was put on display when you put some it is on the door and when you get on the door where you get the the the the the the the location of the place maybe if there are males they are put around that area by then what fruit is that that one is abusive like when you go to the garages all those points they are putting a pole of electricity as if by mentioning bad data watch they can get strings to put the pole up or with your colleagues a despise of others one who doesn't care you need to put the Life of Christ on this place doesn't want to pay dates foreign worlds of critics and the last critic is the critical is always there is satanism praise the name of us but he will have nothing to accuse you if he sees the life of Jesus Christ and that's what we need make me new the following we need to apply the tokens praise the name of us we need to be sure that the blood has been applied that the price that's been asked foreign it is a token um that your
