[1:03:14] your vineyard, Lord, that all your
[1:03:16] children may be blessed. How great you
[1:03:19] are, Lord, and how glorify your holy
[1:03:20] name forever more. bless us through the
[1:03:23] heavenly father for [music] the glory
[1:03:24] and honor of your holy name in the name
[1:03:26] of Jesus Christ we pray and ask this.
[1:03:29] Amen. You may be seated. [music]
[1:03:34] God bless you so much.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; We want to welcome brother Emanuel.
[1:03:45] [applause]
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You are all
[1:03:49] welcome.
[1:03:52] to come for this service
[1:03:55] and fellowship with us today.
[1:03:59] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:04:02] We thank God for the grace he has given
[1:04:04] us another opportunity today.
[1:04:09] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:04:11] We have brother Tim again with us today.
[1:04:18] We last had him last year.
[1:04:22] and he has always been coming every
[1:04:23] year.
[1:04:26] Thank you for your sacrifice.
[1:04:30] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:04:33] We want also to appreciate the church
[1:04:36] members
[1:04:38] that have been standing together.
[1:04:43] I want to appreciate Martin, brother
[1:04:45] Martin and brother Wilson able to stand
[1:04:47] last two Sundays.
[1:04:53] Nelson
[1:04:56] were not around.
[1:04:58] And then we also want to appreciate
[1:04:59] those who able to attend the funeral of
[1:05:01] our brother-in-law in Toro.
[1:05:08] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:05:10] Still may still one of us.
[1:05:14] Brother,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; he was over 80 years of age.
[1:05:20] He passed on yesterday
[1:05:23] and tomorrow
[1:05:25] there is a barrier in
[1:05:29] it that will be good for the members of
[1:05:31] church to be part of that.
[1:05:37] That's why we're not seeing brother here
[1:05:39] today
[1:05:43] and his wife. Praise the name of our
[1:05:45] Lord. We shall have further
[1:05:47] introductions in the afternoon.
[1:05:53] A number of pastors who coming
[1:05:57] be joining us in the course of time
[1:06:02] those who have already come.
[1:06:05] Praise the name of our Lord. Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; So now before I would invite
[1:06:11] our pastor to come and bring in brother
[1:06:13] Tim do
[1:06:22] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[1:07:28] God bless you.
[1:07:32] And I'm a sinful man struggling for your
[1:07:37] mercy.
[1:07:40] And like a broadle [singing]
[1:07:43] [music]
[1:07:43] son,
[1:07:45] I went out on my own.
[1:07:50] I squandered [singing and music] my
[1:07:52] grace and the devil put me down.
[1:07:58] But I know
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; But I know
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; who I am.
[1:08:08] I felt [music] the touch of [singing]
[1:08:10] Jesus on my soul.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; I know the love and [singing] fellowship
[1:08:20] [music]
[1:08:21] of brothers.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I'm coming [singing]
[1:08:27] [music]
[1:08:28] back home. Lord, I surrender.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Take [music] me back.
[1:08:36] Take [singing] me back
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; to the fold
[1:08:42] [music] and [singing] take over.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Take over,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Lord. Take over. [music and singing]
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; I let go of the [singing] race so you
[1:08:57] can leave. [music]
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I'll move over.
[1:09:04] [singing and music]
[1:09:05] Take over.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I [music and singing] realize
[1:09:12] I'm going wrong again.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm a loyal [singing]
[1:09:20] [music] servant, faithful in my zeal.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've given [singing] me the
[1:09:30] chance
[1:09:32] to serve the [music] kingom.
[1:09:36] Like Peter [singing]
[1:09:38] by faith, I'm walking on [music] the
[1:09:42] sea.
[1:09:44] But my pride,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; but my pride
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; keeps getting in the [music] way.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And looking [singing] down, I realize
[1:09:58] I'm [music] sinking.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I can't do this [singing and music]
[1:10:05] alone. The waves waves are getting
[1:10:08] strong.
[1:10:11] [music]
[1:10:11] And I'm [singing] holding up my hand and
[1:10:15] praying for your [music and singing]
[1:10:17] grace.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Won't you take it?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Won't you [music and singing] take it?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me walk again.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Take [music] over.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Take [singing] over.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Take over. [music]
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:10:38] Let [singing] go.
[1:10:40] the [music] rain so you can leave.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I'll move over.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Move over. [singing and music]
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I realize [music and singing]
[1:10:57] I'm going wrong again
[1:11:02] and [music] take [singing] over.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:11:08] Take over. [singing and music]
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Let go
[1:11:15] the race [music] so you can [singing]
[1:11:17] be.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I'll move over. [music]
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Move over.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Take [singing] over.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; You take over,
[1:11:29] Lord. [singing and music]
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Realize
[1:11:32] I'm going wrong again.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Take over. [singing]
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Take over. [music]
[1:11:47] Let go of the [singing] race. So you
[1:11:51] [music] can leave.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I'll move over.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Move over. [music and singing]
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Take over.
[1:12:02] Take our [singing] Lord and [music]
[1:12:05] realize
[1:12:07] I'm going wrong again.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; So take over.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Take [music and singing] over.
[1:12:19] Bless you.
[1:12:21] [applause]
[1:12:22] [music]
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:12:29] That's the cry of the heart
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; that take over the reigns.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because I realize I'm going
[1:12:43] wrong again."
[1:12:47] You see, it's very important
[1:12:50] to always give ourselves into his
[1:12:53] leadership.
[1:12:56] We cannot lead ourselves.
[1:13:00] He's the shepherd of the flock.
[1:13:04] When you feel you are getting off the
[1:13:06] line,
[1:13:09] it's like a sheep just bleed out
[1:13:14] and the good shepherd will be on the
[1:13:16] spot.
[1:13:19] And I feel like he's saying tonight,
[1:13:22] I feel like he's saying tonight,
[1:13:26] stay in line.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; So that we don't go to the left, we
[1:13:32] don't go to the right,
[1:13:35] but we are watching
[1:13:38] the high mark
[1:13:40] of our calling.
[1:13:43] Amen. Amen. So we want to welcome the
[1:13:46] visitors among us.
[1:13:51] This is home
[1:13:54] over and over.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; We appreciate having you when we have
[1:13:59] meetings here.
[1:14:04] Amen. Amen. And more so we appreciate
[1:14:07] friends like brother Tim
[1:14:12] who have us at heart.
[1:14:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; See for a man to make a decision to go.
[1:14:26] You were not only on his you know
[1:14:29] thinking
[1:14:32] but right deep down in his heart.
[1:14:36] So there is a pull
[1:14:39] that keeps bringing him here.
[1:14:44] We don't take you for granted.
[1:14:48] Amen. There is a connection
[1:14:51] and we honestly appreciate the ministry
[1:14:53] of brother Tim.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; It takes us a level higher than where he
[1:15:00] finds us.
[1:15:04] Are you ready to feed on the word?
[1:15:09] Amen. Let's stand up and just give the
[1:15:12] Lord a hand of praise.
[1:15:15] Our brother steps over.
[1:15:19] [applause]
[1:15:22] [music]
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are on.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yours is
[1:15:35] all right. God bless you.
[1:15:39] Greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be in the house of the
[1:15:46] Lord?
[1:15:49] [applause]
[1:15:52] I ask you another question.
[1:15:56] Are you glad to be part of the bride of
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ?
[1:16:07] Amen. We are privileged people.
[1:16:12] Have your seats for a moment.
[1:16:18] This year has been a year of change for
[1:16:20] brother Tim.
[1:16:25] You may have heard I was in South Africa
[1:16:27] for five and a half months.
[1:16:34] I won't get into the details of that.
[1:16:39] I'll just say the Lord used it.
[1:16:43] I was actually going to visit here from
[1:16:45] South Africa,
[1:16:49] but then I canled with brother Steven.
[1:16:56] I wanted to concentrate my efforts in
[1:16:58] South Africa.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Now we're back in Canada.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; There's some changes coming there.
[1:17:11] But I want to thank brother Steven for
[1:17:13] the opportunity.
[1:17:17] Thank brother James for opening the
[1:17:18] pulpit.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Last time I was here,
[1:17:28] Father Steven said, "This is my second
[1:17:30] home." Uh, brother.
[1:17:41] Always a pleasure to be here.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Now remember,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[1:17:50] "The words that I speak unto you,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; they are spirit and they are life.
[1:18:02] Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You want to change something here? All
[1:18:06] right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You get it? Just
[1:18:40] microphone is tangled.
[1:18:45] If I can untangle the microphone,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; maybe we can untangle the word.
[1:18:58] It's only men that tangle things up.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; God does not tangle things up.
[1:19:10] Amen. Amen. But Jesus, as I was saying,
[1:19:14] Jesus said,
[1:19:16] "The words that I speak unto you,
[1:19:20] they are spirit and they are life.
[1:19:24] Why are they spirit and life?
[1:19:28] Because they're God's words.
[1:19:32] God's words have creative power.
[1:19:38] Therefore, if God puts thoughts in this
[1:19:41] mind
[1:19:45] and they're spoken through these lips,
[1:19:49] they go from thought to word.
[1:19:55] then they're not the words of a man.
[1:19:59] If they're not the thoughts of a man,
[1:20:03] but if they're the thoughts of God,
[1:20:06] then they are the word of God.
[1:20:10] Amen. Amen. I was in a service in
[1:20:12] Cloverdale
[1:20:16] and I uh was preaching. I was preaching
[1:20:20] and I I felt led to the subject of the
[1:20:23] woman with the blood issue.
[1:20:31] And while I it was not in my notes,
[1:20:37] but God put the thoughts in my mind.
[1:20:42] And while I begin to speak on the woman
[1:20:44] with the blood issue,
[1:20:48] there was a woman in the congregation
[1:20:53] who had a blood issue
[1:20:56] for several months
[1:20:59] and she told me later,
[1:21:02] "Brother Tim, when you spoke about the
[1:21:04] woman,
[1:21:07] God touched me.
[1:21:11] Hallelujah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I didn't touch her,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; but the word is spirit and life.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, you
[1:21:22] pull on God.
[1:21:31] Now, she still had some pain,
[1:21:35] but she said it'll go away.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; But it didn't go away.
[1:21:40] And so a couple weeks later,
[1:21:44] she came for prayer.
[1:21:47] But she said to the Lord,
[1:21:49] "I want brother Tim to pray for me."
[1:21:54] And I didn't know anything about the
[1:21:56] situation.
[1:21:59] And I was standing with another brother
[1:22:02] getting ready to pray for another
[1:22:04] sister.
[1:22:09] And I saw this woman come up with her, I
[1:22:13] think it was her daughter.
[1:22:17] And I said to the brother that was with
[1:22:19] me,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I said, "Here, you pray for this woman.
[1:22:25] I'll go pray for this sister."
[1:22:28] Now remember, that was her request. That
[1:22:31] was her request,
[1:22:35] not to me, to God.
[1:22:40] And so as I prayed for her,
[1:22:44] the Lord came down and took away her
[1:22:46] pain.
[1:22:50] Now the testimony doesn't end there.
[1:22:55] When I was in South Africa,
[1:22:58] I was sharing the testimony in the
[1:22:59] church
[1:23:03] to encourage the people to believe
[1:23:08] and while I was sharing the testimony,
[1:23:12] a woman in the church,
[1:23:14] she turned to her husband.
[1:23:17] She said, "Something just happened.
[1:23:20] She was healed.
[1:23:24] of the same blood issue.
[1:23:29] Hallelujah. Amen. And then I went to
[1:23:31] Ethiopia
[1:23:33] and I shared the testimony
[1:23:37] and a woman let out a scream.
[1:23:41] She also had a blood issue.
[1:23:45] God healed her.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:50] She has no more trouble.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The power of the word of this end time
[1:24:02] message is unlimited.
[1:24:11] All that you have need of,
[1:24:15] if you believe,
[1:24:18] all things are possible.
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So, let's stand together.
[1:24:27] Take our Bibles and turn to the book of
[1:24:29] Ezekiel,
[1:24:33] chapter 36.
[1:24:36] as to
[1:24:45] [clears throat]
[1:24:53] it refused. Can I help you?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; I got it finally.
[1:25:00] It's only in this church that I have
[1:25:02] trouble unwrapping a bottle.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:25:12] [laughter]
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven said, "We broke the
[1:25:18] seal."
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:25:22] amen.
[1:25:24] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:25:26] prayer before
[1:25:32] We're so glad to be here this morning
[1:25:36] with you. All things are possible.
[1:25:40] This is not a natural gathering.
[1:25:44] It's a supernatural gathering.
[1:25:47] We are gathered in heavenly places in
[1:25:49] Christ Jesus.
[1:25:54] I'm just a man.
[1:25:57] Whatever gift there is in [snorts] me,
[1:25:59] you put it there.
[1:26:03] I pray that you'd help the man to get
[1:26:04] out of the way
[1:26:08] that you could use the gift that you put
[1:26:10] in there.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And I pray the same for brother Emanuel.
[1:26:18] I pray the same for your people.
[1:26:22] Help us to yield our humanity to you
[1:26:29] that you might move in our lives on a
[1:26:31] supernatural plane.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Father, you know every need.
[1:26:41] There's no secrets from you.
[1:26:44] Direct this service the way you want it.
[1:26:46] Father,
[1:26:49] we yield oursel to you.
[1:26:52] in Jesus Christ.
[1:26:55] Amen. Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 36.
[1:27:01] Now, we're going to take a subject this
[1:27:02] morning of understanding the new birth.
[1:27:10] And we have some slides for you.
[1:27:15] You can go ahead and and start the
[1:27:17] slideshow.
[1:27:21] And I think the first slide is just the
[1:27:23] title.
[1:27:27] Now watch in Ezekiel 36 here.
[1:27:32] Verse 24.
[1:27:34] For I will take you from among your
[1:27:36] heathen and gather you out of all
[1:27:38] countries and will bring you into your
[1:27:41] own land.
[1:27:52] So the very first verse
[1:27:55] he's talking about inheritance.
[1:27:59] So what he's talking about here as we
[1:28:01] get into the new birth is connected to
[1:28:04] your inheritance.
[1:28:10] Then I will sprinkle clean water upon
[1:28:13] you, and you shall be clean. From all
[1:28:15] your filthiness, and from all your idols
[1:28:18] will I cleanse you.
[1:28:30] A new heart also will I give you, and a
[1:28:33] new spirit will I put within you, and I
[1:28:35] will take away the stony heart out of
[1:28:38] your flesh, and I will give you a heart
[1:28:40] of flesh.
[1:28:53] Now in verse 26 here, he's not talking
[1:28:56] about four different things.
[1:29:01] He's talking about one process
[1:29:06] and things that will take place within
[1:29:09] that process.
[1:29:15] Verse 27.
[1:29:17] And I will put my spirit within you and
[1:29:21] cause you to walk in my statutes, and
[1:29:24] you shall keep my judgments and do them.
[1:29:39] So, he's speaking about a new covenant.
[1:29:43] All right? And he says, "I'll put my
[1:29:45] spirit in you."
[1:29:49] And and is a conjunction.
[1:29:53] It connects it together.
[1:29:56] And I will cause you to walk in my
[1:29:58] statute.
[1:30:01] He's not talking two different things.
[1:30:05] I give you my spirit.
[1:30:08] My spirit in you will cause you to walk
[1:30:11] in my statutes.
[1:30:15] All right? Because previously they only
[1:30:18] walked in God's statutes by the law.
[1:30:25] So he's talking about taking the church
[1:30:27] from law to grace
[1:30:32] and then under grace he gives us his
[1:30:35] spirit
[1:30:38] to cause us to walk in his statutes.
[1:30:43] Verse 28. And you shall dwell in the
[1:30:46] land that I gave your fathers. There's
[1:30:47] inheritance. And you shall be my people
[1:30:50] and I will be your God.
[1:31:02] So by this process
[1:31:07] called the new birth,
[1:31:10] I will cause you to possess your
[1:31:13] inheritance.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord add his blessing to the
[1:31:19] word you may not see.
[1:31:22] All right.
[1:31:24] Now, today we're going to spend some
[1:31:26] time
[1:31:29] and we'll the two services will be
[1:31:31] connected
[1:31:37] and our purpose is to dig into the
[1:31:39] message
[1:31:42] because all the answers are in the
[1:31:44] message.
[1:31:49] the things that will help us in our
[1:31:51] daytoday battle.
[1:31:58] Anybody in a battle?
[1:32:00] Anyone in a battle?
[1:32:09] Are you in a battle?
[1:32:12] Amen. Only some of you. Amen.
[1:32:17] Brother Brown says when you're born
[1:32:18] again, that puts you in a battle.
[1:32:25] When when he referred to Israel going
[1:32:27] into the promised land
[1:32:32] that represented the Holy Ghost,
[1:32:36] it did not represent the millennium
[1:32:41] because there was wars and fightings in
[1:32:43] the land.
[1:32:49] that but they had to fight to possess
[1:32:51] their land.
[1:32:55] How many want to possess your land?
[1:33:01] How many are sons and daughters of God?
[1:33:07] This civilization
[1:33:11] is not your land.
[1:33:14] Your land is what is described in the
[1:33:16] title deed.
[1:33:22] And all the answers you need
[1:33:28] are contained within the message of the
[1:33:30] hour.
[1:33:34] God has spoken to this generation,
[1:33:38] the last church age,
[1:33:41] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:44] through the mouth of a prophet.
[1:33:47] I'll give you everything you need
[1:33:51] to possess your land.
[1:33:55] Amen. Amen. It's the entirety of the
[1:33:58] message.
[1:34:02] It spans seven church ages.
[1:34:06] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:34:08] seventh angel,
[1:34:11] when he shall begin to sound,
[1:34:15] all the mystery of God would be
[1:34:16] finished.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of who you are in
[1:34:24] Christ Jesus. For Christ is the mystery
[1:34:29] of God revealed.
[1:34:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; All right. I I don't see a slideshow
[1:34:36] here.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I'm ready. If you're ready.
[1:34:42] All right. Just click F5. Whatever.
[1:34:44] Let's roll. Ah, that's going to be hard
[1:34:46] to see. Next slide.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; All right. Romans 12 and verse one.
[1:34:54] And I want you to catch this now.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Says, "I beseech you therefore,
[1:34:58] brethren, by the mercies of God that you
[1:35:00] present your bodies a living sacrifice,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[1:35:07] reasonable service."
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; For you.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just waiting for the
[1:35:12] interrupter here, interpreter here.
[1:35:14] [laughter]
[1:35:16] All right.
[1:35:31] But what does bodies have to do with it?
[1:35:36] We're not under the law. We're under
[1:35:37] grace.
[1:35:40] But now we cannot fulfill the word by
[1:35:42] our body.
[1:35:46] But we must present our bodies a living
[1:35:49] sacrifice.
[1:35:52] It's our reasonable service.
[1:35:56] Some interpretations
[1:35:59] say it is our spiritual worship.
[1:36:03] So you present your bodies
[1:36:06] to God as a sacrifice
[1:36:10] in worship unto him.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; The next verse,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; be not conformed to the world, but be
[1:36:18] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:36:23] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:36:25] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[1:36:42] Now we've gone from the body to the
[1:36:44] mind.
[1:36:47] The mind is the spirit.
[1:36:51] All right? So there has to be a renewing
[1:36:53] of our mind
[1:36:56] or a new mind
[1:37:00] or as Ezekiel calls it a new spirit.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; All right. So it's not the old spirit.
[1:37:11] I let me rephrase that.
[1:37:15] It's a different spirit,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; but it is a renewed spirit.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; The renewing of our minds
[1:37:28] click.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; All right. In the Smyrnian church age,
[1:37:34] see, now you clicked twice, didn't you?
[1:37:37] See, I didn't say click twice. You stay
[1:37:39] with me, Brother Henry. Don't get ahead
[1:37:42] of me.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
[1:37:44] He says, "Now in the Smyrnian church
[1:37:46] age, brother Brandham describes the
[1:37:48] birth."
[1:37:52] He says, "Now then here we are coming to
[1:37:54] a conclusion
[1:37:58] as the eternal logos God was was
[1:38:01] manifest in the sun
[1:38:08] and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:38:10] the Godhead bodily.
[1:38:16] And that eternal one was the father
[1:38:18] manifest in flesh
[1:38:24] and thereby gained the title of son.
[1:38:31] Let me read that again.
[1:38:34] That eternal one,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; was the father
[1:38:41] manifest in flesh
[1:38:44] and thereby gained the title of son.
[1:38:51] Now I asked you already, how many sons
[1:38:53] and daughters of God are here?
[1:38:58] And you put your hand up. All right. How
[1:39:01] do you gain the title of son or
[1:39:03] daughter?
[1:39:07] It must be the father manifest in flesh.
[1:39:12] Because brother Brandham goes on.
[1:39:15] And he says, "Even so we
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; eternal in his thoughts
[1:39:25] in our turn became the many membered
[1:39:29] spoken word seed
[1:39:37] manifest in flesh.
[1:39:41] And those eternal thoughts
[1:39:44] now manifest in flesh
[1:39:48] are the sons of God.
[1:39:52] Even as we are so called.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Can you put your name there?
[1:40:02] Can you say amen to that?
[1:40:04] You were a thought of God.
[1:40:08] That thought is now materialized into
[1:40:14] All right, let's go to the next one.
[1:40:18] Is a continuation of the same quote.
[1:40:22] We did not become seed by the rebirth.
[1:40:29] We were seed.
[1:40:33] Somebody say amen.
[1:40:36] Therefore, we're reborn.
[1:40:40] For only the elect can be reborn.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Because we were seed is the reason we
[1:40:52] could be quickened.
[1:40:59] In nonseed there is nothing to quicken.
[1:41:07] You had to be a thought.
[1:41:12] The thought was materialized
[1:41:17] and the word for the hour came to you
[1:41:24] and quicken that part of God in you.
[1:41:33] You didn't know anything about it
[1:41:39] quickened you.
[1:41:42] The elect of the hour,
[1:41:46] the seed that is supposed to manifest in
[1:41:49] that season
[1:41:55] are quickened by the message of the
[1:41:58] hour.
[1:42:00] Let me let me comment.
[1:42:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:14] Next, Henry.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; I'll just say your name. Every time I
[1:42:18] say your name, you just give me a click.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; All right. Henry.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we all have a body.
[1:42:31] Henry.
[1:42:33] Oh,
[1:42:36] some of our bodies look like this.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Henry. Henry.
[1:42:43] But when we were younger, they used to
[1:42:45] look like this.
[1:42:49] But we all have a body. Henry. Henry.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; But there's a next there's something
[1:42:59] else there. Just beside the body, you
[1:43:01] are not your body
[1:43:06] behind the body. Henry, there's
[1:43:08] something else.
[1:43:13] There's a spirit.
[1:43:16] Now, the spirit, we don't know the form,
[1:43:23] but it's the record of your life.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; It's the record of your natural life.
[1:43:32] I like to like to your page in the book
[1:43:36] of life.
[1:43:41] Amen. It records your actions
[1:43:47] and sometimes those are not good
[1:43:49] actions.
[1:43:51] But brother Brandham said, "If there's
[1:43:54] something wrong with you,
[1:43:58] I contact your spirit."
[1:44:02] Somehow it's recorded there.
[1:44:09] It doesn't contact your flesh,
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; but it's recorded in your spirit.
[1:44:17] And we'll go into this more as time goes
[1:44:19] on.
[1:44:24] And inside of that is a soul
[1:44:28] and in that soul is a seed gene.
[1:44:35] If you are an elect of God,
[1:44:40] we don't know really the form of the
[1:44:43] soul,
[1:44:47] but that is the real you.
[1:44:51] In some places, brother Brandham says
[1:44:53] the soul is the seed gene.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And in some places, he says the seed is
[1:45:03] in the soul.
[1:45:07] It doesn't make no difference.
[1:45:10] But the soul and the seed are tied
[1:45:12] together.
[1:45:17] So, you have a three-part body, Henry.
[1:45:23] Henry. Amen. Henry.
[1:45:26] Now, let's take a look at this body
[1:45:29] just for a minute.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Because we pay so much attention to it
[1:45:35] that we really go too far.
[1:45:38] Now, in the in this body, if we magnify
[1:45:42] it up, Henry
[1:45:46] In this body are particles,
[1:45:50] molecules
[1:45:53] and you're made up of all
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; molecules.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Molecules.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Which are made up
[1:46:04] actually these are cells if I would call
[1:46:06] it this way. It doesn't really matter.
[1:46:08] These are pieces of your body. There's
[1:46:12] there's more than 50 trillion of these
[1:46:15] in your body.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Henry
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Henry
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Henry
[1:46:24] inside of that is a DNA.
[1:46:30] There are 92 DNA in each cell.
[1:46:41] If we go further, these DNA is made up
[1:46:45] of atoms.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; There are 566 atoms in every DNA. 66
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; 566.
[1:47:06] Now, here we go. I'm going to challenge
[1:47:08] our inter interpreter here.
[1:47:11] There are seven billion billion billion
[1:47:16] atoms in your body.
[1:47:22] [laughter]
[1:47:27] everybody.
[1:47:31] That's what your body is made of.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide, Henry.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; An one single atom.
[1:47:49] If we take the nucleus of the atom
[1:47:56] and
[1:47:58] and magnify it up to the size of a fly.
[1:48:06] The rest of the atom would be flying
[1:48:08] around the size of a stadium.
[1:48:18] [snorts]
[1:48:23] So much space in an atom.
[1:48:32] So now you're saying why are you even
[1:48:35] saying this brother?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I want to show you how little your body
[1:48:43] means.
[1:48:54] So if you took all the space
[1:48:59] and put it all collapsed it all
[1:49:01] together,
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; the nucleus
[1:49:09] and the
[1:49:11] electrons. Can you can you go there?
[1:49:15] [laughter]
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; The particles. Let's call it that.
[1:49:20] take all the space out and just
[1:49:22] collapse.
[1:49:27] You could put the entire human race in a
[1:49:31] teaspoon.
[1:49:48] I'm saying
[1:49:51] I'm saying your body is a lot of
[1:49:54] nothing.
[1:50:03] What is holding all these parts
[1:50:05] together?
[1:50:10] The life inside of it.
[1:50:18] Amen.
[1:50:20] Amen. No matter
[1:50:24] no matter no matter how much science can
[1:50:26] look at your body
[1:50:32] your body will they will never find the
[1:50:35] life
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; because the life is in the soul.
[1:50:46] You see, this is just a garment.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And we're not even talking about the
[1:50:52] heavenly garment,
[1:50:56] the theophony.
[1:50:59] We're just explaining this body.
[1:51:03] All right. Now, remember
[1:51:07] this is real.
[1:51:10] But do you correctly interpret what your
[1:51:14] body is telling you?
[1:51:21] Are you seeing what you think you're
[1:51:24] seeing?
[1:51:28] Jonah called many things lying vanities.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Jonah Jonah.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Jonah.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Jonah.
[1:51:39] See, there's many things you think you
[1:51:41] understand.
[1:51:45] You see them,
[1:51:47] you feel them,
[1:51:49] but your flesh could be lying to you.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; You see, you have to operate by the word
[1:51:59] of God alone.
[1:52:05] That's why brother Brandham even said
[1:52:10] stay with what's on the tapes.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; There's people down through the ages
[1:52:16] said, "Oh, I heard brother Brandham say
[1:52:18] this or I I heard him say that
[1:52:27] or he said this to me personally.
[1:52:31] Be careful.
[1:52:33] cuz you can be deceived.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Stay with what's on the tank.
[1:52:49] All right. Next one.
[1:52:52] In 1 Corinthians 15 talking about the
[1:52:54] body, it says that which thou seest thou
[1:52:56] seest not that body that shall be but
[1:52:59] bear grain that it may chance of wheat
[1:53:03] or some other grain. It's talking about
[1:53:05] the body that pertains to the
[1:53:07] seedinthians
[1:53:11] 15.
[1:53:34] But God giveth it a body as it pleases
[1:53:37] him, and to every seed his own body.
[1:53:48] All flesh is not the same flesh. But
[1:53:50] there is one kind of flesh of men,
[1:53:52] another flesh of beasts, another of
[1:53:54] fishes, another of birds.
[1:54:06] Now, what makes them different?
[1:54:11] It's right in the Bible.
[1:54:13] Brother said, "The soul controls the
[1:54:15] spirit. The spirit controls the body."
[1:54:21] Now remember when Nebuchadnezzar was
[1:54:23] lifted up in pride,
[1:54:27] God knocked God brought him down
[1:54:31] by taking the spirit of an animal and
[1:54:34] putting it on him.
[1:54:38] Now if you take the human spirit out,
[1:54:40] put an animal spirit in,
[1:54:46] then the body starts acting like an
[1:54:48] animal.
[1:54:51] Now his hair started growing like
[1:54:53] feathers.
[1:54:57] His fingernails like claws.
[1:55:03] And his taste buds begin to desire the
[1:55:06] grass of the ground.
[1:55:11] Why? His spirit changed.
[1:55:15] And the body had to line up with the
[1:55:17] spirit.
[1:55:22] That's why the Bible says, "The same
[1:55:25] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:55:27] dead
[1:55:31] dwell in you
[1:55:33] will also quicken your mortal body.
[1:55:39] Not bring your body subject to humanity,
[1:55:44] but bring your body subject to the word
[1:55:50] because his spirit is the word.
[1:55:55] In the beginning was the word
[1:55:58] and the word was with God
[1:56:01] with God.
[1:56:03] Amen. So get his spirit.
[1:56:06] and by his stripes you were healed.
[1:56:12] Yet his spirit
[1:56:14] and he's your deliverer.
[1:56:18] He's your provider.
[1:56:21] He will bring this body subject to every
[1:56:23] divine cause.
[1:56:28] Don't let the devil tell you anything
[1:56:29] different.
[1:56:33] When you have the spirit of God,
[1:56:36] You have every promise.
[1:56:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; All right. Last verse.
[1:56:45] Verse 40. Here. There are also celestial
[1:56:48] bodies and bodies terrestrial. But the
[1:56:50] glory of the celestial is one. The glory
[1:56:52] of terrestrial is another.
[1:57:07] Amen. We don't have time to go into that
[1:57:09] one. Henry
[1:57:12] forward.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Henry.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Henry.
[1:57:15] Amen.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; There we are. Matthew 26
[1:57:23] and verse 40.
[1:57:28] And he cometh to the disciples, and
[1:57:30] findeth them asleep, and says to Peter,
[1:57:33] "What could you not watch with me one
[1:57:36] hour?
[1:57:49] Watch and pray that you enter not into
[1:57:52] temptation. The spirit indeed is
[1:57:54] willing, but the flesh is weak.
[1:58:08] You see, that's why we read the
[1:58:10] scripture already.
[1:58:13] Romans 12,
[1:58:15] I beseech you that you present your
[1:58:17] bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:58:23] Watch and pray.
[1:58:27] Amen. Next. Next. Henry.
[1:58:30] Romans 7
[1:58:34] and verse 18.
[1:58:38] Paul describes the battle between the
[1:58:40] flesh and the spirit.
[1:58:45] For I know that in me that is in my
[1:58:47] flesh dwelleth no good thing.
[1:58:59] Now often times
[1:59:02] when I preach a couple weeks after youth
[1:59:04] camp
[1:59:10] And you know in camp it's a great
[1:59:12] presence of the Lord
[1:59:18] experiences with God.
[1:59:21] And then brother Tim gets up in the pull
[1:59:23] pit
[1:59:25] and says to the young people,
[1:59:28] I says, "But now you realize you have
[1:59:30] the same stinking flesh that you had
[1:59:33] before camp.
[1:59:38] same stinking flesh.
[1:59:42] Your body was not changed at camp.
[1:59:50] Your soul might have been changed.
[1:59:53] Your spirit might have been washed,
[1:59:56] but your flesh is your flesh.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; How many are born again?
[2:00:04] All right. Now, put your hand down. Now,
[2:00:07] how many of you
[2:00:10] your flesh is born again?
[2:00:16] See, that's what Nicodemus asked Jesus.
[2:00:20] How can a man be born again?
[2:00:24] Can he enter in a second time into his
[2:00:26] mother's womb
[2:00:29] and have a second natural birth?
[2:00:33] Jesus says, "How be it you're a leader
[2:00:35] in Israel and you don't understand this
[2:00:37] stuff.
[2:00:40] That which is born of flesh is flesh,
[2:00:44] but that which is born of the spirit is
[2:00:46] spirit."
[2:00:50] Now, brother Brandham says Paul here in
[2:00:52] Romans 7 is talking about a born again
[2:00:54] believer.
[2:00:58] For I know that in me that is in my
[2:01:00] flesh dwelleth no good thing.
[2:01:10] For to will is present with me, but how
[2:01:12] to perform that which is good I find
[2:01:14] not.
[2:01:21] The spirit is willing but the flesh is
[2:01:23] weak.
[2:01:26] He say he goes on he says for the good
[2:01:27] that I would do not the good that I
[2:01:30] would do sorry the good that I would I
[2:01:32] do not but the evil which I would not
[2:01:36] that I do
[2:01:44] now just a minute here
[2:01:47] brother is talking about a born again
[2:01:49] believer Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; The evil
[2:01:59] which I would not
[2:02:02] that I do.
[2:02:04] I make mistakes.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Why do you make mistakes?
[2:02:12] Cuz your body is not yet changed.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Paul goes into it. He says, "Now if I do
[2:02:20] that, I would not. It is no more I that
[2:02:23] do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[2:02:25] Amen.
[2:02:38] Watch as he brings this out here.
[2:02:42] I find then a law
[2:02:44] that when I would do good, evil is
[2:02:46] present with me.
[2:02:50] I am motivated to do good.
[2:02:54] That's God's nature in the soul.
[2:03:00] But evil is present.
[2:03:04] I delight in the law of God after the
[2:03:07] inward man.
[2:03:12] But I see another law in my members,
[2:03:18] waring against the law of my mind,
[2:03:23] and bringing me into captivity to the
[2:03:25] law of sin which is in my members.
[2:03:34] Oh wretched man that I am. Oh,
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; thou shalt deliver me from the body of
[2:03:41] this death.
[2:03:49] I tell you what,
[2:03:52] there's coming a body change.
[2:03:57] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[2:03:59] be changed.
[2:04:04] One day you will make your last mistake.
[2:04:10] One day you will be changed.
[2:04:14] So I cannot stand up here and condemn
[2:04:16] you for making a mistake.
[2:04:21] When brother Bradom says I make mistakes
[2:04:23] every day,
[2:04:26] He was talking about himself.
[2:04:30] He said, "I make mistakes."
[2:04:34] Why? Because the wretched body of sin
[2:04:37] that we dwell in.
[2:04:41] But we have a promise.
[2:04:44] We shall be changed.
[2:04:47] And even more than that,
[2:04:50] if the spirit of God dwells in us,
[2:04:54] It will bring this body subject to the
[2:04:56] word of God.
[2:05:01] For the soul controls the spirit
[2:05:06] and the spirit controls the body.
[2:05:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; I could go into the next verse which is
[2:05:17] Romans 8. There is therefore now no
[2:05:19] condemnation.
[2:05:24] to them who walk after the spirit, not
[2:05:26] after the flesh.
[2:05:30] Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something,
[2:05:34] brother. The pastor can correct me after
[2:05:36] I'm gone.
[2:05:40] But as long as you're in this flesh,
[2:05:44] there will be times in your life
[2:05:48] in weakness
[2:05:50] and in deception
[2:05:52] you will get in the flesh.
[2:06:03] But we have a propitiation.
[2:06:08] We have a sacrifice.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Put it under the blood.
[2:06:15] If you fall, get up again.
[2:06:19] Repent of your mistake
[2:06:22] and move on with God.
[2:06:27] Amen.
[2:06:28] Amen. Henry. Amen. Oh, a
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Henry.
[2:06:33] Henry.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; There we go. Galatians 5:1 17.
[2:06:39] We'll wait for the interpreter here.
[2:06:47] [snorts]
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Galatians 5.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:1 17. Are you enjoying this
[2:06:55] this morning?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; It is fine.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; 5:1 17. For the flesh lusts against the
[2:07:04] spirit, the spirit against the flesh.
[2:07:06] That's the Holy Spirit, not your spirit.
[2:07:08] And these are contrary one to the other,
[2:07:10] so that you cannot do the things that
[2:07:13] you would.
[2:07:17] Verse seven.
[2:07:35] If you had a perfect body,
[2:07:41] you'd be in heaven.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Because that's what holds you here.
[2:07:48] It is.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; That's what holds you here
[2:07:51] is the sin of this body.
[2:07:55] As long as you live in a sinful body,
[2:07:58] you're bound in the sinful realm.
[2:08:06] But somebody just left their body
[2:08:08] yesterday.
[2:08:12] What was his name?
[2:08:16] You tell the people.
[2:08:19] What did he do? He laid his body down.
[2:08:24] He didn't lay down.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; He laid his body down
[2:08:31] without a sinful body
[2:08:36] to go to his reward.
[2:08:41] Now, he's not limited to the limits of a
[2:08:43] sinful body.
[2:08:50] If the Lord carries
[2:08:53] We will lay these bodies down.
[2:08:56] But I'm convinced
[2:08:59] that there are people right here in this
[2:09:01] room
[2:09:04] who will not taste death.
[2:09:08] I'm convinced
[2:09:11] that there are people
[2:09:13] who have receive the power of the
[2:09:15] resurrection
[2:09:18] and will receive a body change.
[2:09:22] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; and they'll all of a sudden go from
[2:09:28] being bound by sin
[2:09:34] to being loosed,
[2:09:37] free,
[2:09:40] manifest entirely
[2:09:44] what it is to be a son of God.
[2:09:49] Hallelujah. That's what's inside of you.
[2:09:53] That's why. Oh, I'll better read the
[2:09:56] rest of the verse here.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; But if you be led of the spirit, you're
[2:09:59] not under the law.
[2:10:06] 18.
[2:10:13] Now the works of the flesh are manifest.
[2:10:19] Now, it doesn't say the works of the
[2:10:20] sons of God.
[2:10:25] Says the works of the flesh.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; This is what lays in your body.
[2:10:35] W
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
[2:10:39] lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
[2:10:41] hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
[2:10:44] strife, seditions, heresies, envy,
[2:10:46] murders, drunkenness, rellings, and such
[2:10:49] like. Go ahead.
[2:11:12] Oh no, brother Tim. I'm a believer.
[2:11:16] You are what? I'm a believer.
[2:11:22] I have been saved.
[2:11:26] My body doesn't do those things.
[2:11:31] Brother Brandham said, "If God take his
[2:11:35] hand off me,
[2:11:38] I would fall tomorrow
[2:11:41] because these things are laying in your
[2:11:43] flesh.
[2:11:47] But if the spirit of that raised up
[2:11:49] Christ from the dead,
[2:11:54] it will keep your body in subjection to
[2:12:01] Hallelujah.
[2:12:06] Because they which
[2:12:11] they which do such things
[2:12:14] shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[2:12:18] that you shall inherit the kingdom of
[2:12:22] God.
[2:12:25] It is your inheritance.
[2:12:30] You see, you can probably tell by now
[2:12:32] that Brother Tim doesn't preach a
[2:12:33] legalistic message.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim,
[2:12:41] I'm not here to preach legalism.
[2:12:44] I'm here to preach the power of the
[2:12:46] blood.
[2:12:50] I'm here to preach the grace of God
[2:12:55] to the glory of his grace.
[2:13:00] Amen. Amen. That's what we have received
[2:13:03] in this hour.
[2:13:06] Because when you know who you are,
[2:13:11] you behave accordingly.
[2:13:16] All right. Brother Brandham talked about
[2:13:17] the slave in the field.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Slave
[2:13:24] in America.
[2:13:26] They bought and sold slaves.
[2:13:30] The traders came by the farmer's field
[2:13:35] and they noticed this young man.
[2:13:38] He wasn't bent over and sad like
[2:13:40] everybody.
[2:13:45] He conducted himself differently.
[2:13:49] His head was up. His shoulders were
[2:13:51] back.
[2:13:53] He was a slave.
[2:13:56] As the farmer, what makes him different?
[2:14:01] Does he eat better?
[2:14:03] They said no. Does he have is he the
[2:14:06] boss of the slaves?
[2:14:08] Said no. What makes him different?
[2:14:12] the farmer said it's be I wondered it
[2:14:15] myself
[2:14:20] but one day I found out
[2:14:22] back where he's from
[2:14:26] his father is a king
[2:14:29] and he conducts himself as a son of a
[2:14:32] king
[2:14:37] now just a minute
[2:14:40] just a minute here a minute. Just give
[2:14:42] me a minute.
[2:14:45] What if he didn't know he was the son of
[2:14:48] a king?
[2:14:53] He would still be the son of a king.
[2:14:58] But because he didn't know,
[2:15:01] he would behave like everybody else.
[2:15:07] But because he knew who he [screaming]
[2:15:09] was,
[2:15:13] It caused his actions to be different.
[2:15:20] And that's what this message has come
[2:15:21] for,
[2:15:25] to show you who [screaming] you are,
[2:15:29] to cause you to recognize yourself.
[2:15:33] And then the bride recognizes who she
[2:15:36] is. [screaming]
[2:15:40] She becomes an invincible army.
[2:15:45] It doesn't change who you are.
[2:15:48] You always were a thought of
[2:15:53] this message.
[2:15:55] Show you [screaming]
[2:15:57] who you always were.
[2:16:01] You were quickened by this message.
[2:16:03] [screaming]
[2:16:06] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham said,
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; the legalism in the message,
[2:16:16] do this, don't do that.
[2:16:19] You know, you act like this, you behave
[2:16:21] like this.
[2:16:26] Shame on you. You should be better than
[2:16:28] that. [screaming]
[2:16:31] Stop doing those things.
[2:16:33] We don't behave like that.
[2:16:36] and not of the world. [screaming]
[2:16:39] All of those things
[2:16:41] said that came from Pentecost.
[2:16:45] It's Pentecostalism creeping into the
[2:16:47] message,
[2:16:52] trying to tell you not to be bad.
[2:16:57] But that's not what the message is.
[2:17:02] The message is not just to show you
[2:17:04] you're sinners and you need to repent.
[2:17:14] But the seals came open.
[2:17:19] Show you your name under the seals.
[2:17:26] And when you see yourself in the earth,
[2:17:28] [screaming]
[2:17:32] Then you know those are works of the
[2:17:34] flesh
[2:17:37] and you present your body a living soul
[2:17:42] because you're a child of God.
[2:17:46] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:17:49] The word has come open
[2:17:53] not to show you who brother Brandham
[2:17:55] was.
[2:17:58] Not to show you who brother Tim is.
[2:18:02] Not to show you who brother Steven is.
[2:18:06] To show you who you are.
[2:18:09] Hallelujah.
[2:18:11] Message. [cheering]
[2:18:13] [applause]
[2:18:23] Amen.
[2:18:26] Hallelujah.
[2:18:28] Yes.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Now, now Henry's getting caught up in
[2:18:33] the spirit.
[2:18:40] The
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; You see in in the amplified version it
[2:18:42] says it this way. For the desires of the
[2:18:45] flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit and
[2:18:48] the desires of the spirit are opposed to
[2:18:50] the flesh.
[2:18:54] No,
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; this is a different interpretation. Ah,
[2:18:56] just interpret it. Interpret these
[2:18:59] words.
[2:19:17] These are antagonistic to each other.
[2:19:24] See, I'm trying to show you what's going
[2:19:26] on in your life.
[2:19:31] If you weren't born again, there's no
[2:19:32] battle when you are not. Not when you're
[2:19:35] not born again.
[2:19:39] It's all unbelief.
[2:19:41] But when the nature of God comes in,
[2:19:47] the spirit wars against the flesh
[2:19:52] and the flesh wars against the snow.
[2:19:56] Who is your greatest enemy?
[2:20:00] Right here.
[2:20:02] Here's your greatest enemy
[2:20:06] flesh.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Romans 8. Here we come now.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; You can turn to it if you want to, Mr.
[2:20:17] Interpreter. [laughter]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Romans 8,
[2:20:22] verse 11.
[2:20:26] Huh?
[2:20:28] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[2:20:30] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[2:20:32] that raised up Christ from the dead
[2:20:34] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[2:20:36] his spirit that dwelleth in you. We've
[2:20:38] quoted it, but we'll read it for you. Go
[2:20:40] ahead.
[2:20:54] Therefore, brethren,
[2:21:00] therefore, brethren, we are debtors not
[2:21:03] to live after the fle or to the flesh,
[2:21:05] but to live,
[2:21:08] not to the flesh to live after the
[2:21:10] flesh.
[2:21:18] For if you live after the flesh, you
[2:21:20] shall die. But if you through the spirit
[2:21:23] do glorify the deeds of the body, you
[2:21:25] shall live.
[2:21:38] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[2:21:41] God, they are the sons of God.
[2:21:51] Amen. One. Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Now we move on.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; No, go back. I want a blank screen if
[2:21:59] possible. Go back. Oh, just there's no
[2:22:02] blank. Okay, just leave it there then.
[2:22:03] Sorry, Henry. All right. Now, the bo so
[2:22:06] your body is not the answer either
[2:22:09] positive or negative.
[2:22:21] you are saved or unsaved.
[2:22:28] You can impersonate all the motions of a
[2:22:32] believer like Judas did.
[2:22:41] He healed the sick, cast out devils
[2:22:45] and was lost,
[2:22:47] son of predition.
[2:22:49] But because we're born in the natural,
[2:22:54] there's a focus on the physical.
[2:22:58] And we teach our children
[2:23:01] when they're babies
[2:23:03] to fulfill the desires of the flesh.
[2:23:08] There's three things a baby needs.
[2:23:12] Food, sleep, clean diaper.
[2:23:18] If it has those, if it has those three
[2:23:21] things, it's happy.
[2:23:25] Is that right?
[2:23:27] All the mothers said, "Amen."
[2:23:30] Food, sleep, clean diaper.
[2:23:38] And when the baby's crying, we check
[2:23:40] those three things.
[2:23:44] Why? to satisfy the flesh,
[2:23:48] to keep the flesh happy.
[2:23:52] But when we come to the age of
[2:23:54] accountability, there's more.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; All right,
[2:24:04] I'm going to I'm going to skip some
[2:24:06] things here, so stay with me.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; And again.
[2:24:13] And again. All right. Oh, Galatians 2:20
[2:24:17] says, "I am crucified with Christ.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but
[2:24:22] Christ liveth in me. And the life which
[2:24:24] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[2:24:27] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[2:24:30] and gave himself for me.
[2:24:50] All right. Now, next one.
[2:24:54] This is out of Philippians 3.
[2:24:58] For we are the circumcision
[2:25:01] which worship God in the spirit and
[2:25:03] rejoice in Christ Jesus. and
[2:25:18] have no confidence in the flesh.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:25:29] Now, let's
[2:25:31] I dealt a long time with that.
[2:25:36] And now I'm going to take the we're
[2:25:37] going to move forward here.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; The foundation is laid.
[2:25:46] Now remember Jesus in Luke 24 he walks
[2:25:50] on the road to Emmas and there he draws
[2:25:52] near to them. In verse 16 says their
[2:25:54] eyes were holden that they should not
[2:25:55] know him.
[2:26:06] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[2:26:08] him later on and he vanished out of
[2:26:10] their sight.
[2:26:18] That's when they said, "Did not our
[2:26:19] hearts burn within us?"
[2:26:25] So their eyes deceived them
[2:26:29] and then their eyes became open.
[2:26:33] Next clip
[2:26:35] and as they thus spake, this is later
[2:26:38] Jesus stood in their midst
[2:26:44] and he shows them his hands and his
[2:26:46] feet.
[2:26:51] Next one.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, "These are the words which
[2:26:55] I spake unto you when I was yet with
[2:26:57] you, all the things that were written in
[2:27:00] the law of Moses.
[2:27:11] [snorts] You see, you're on a journey.
[2:27:15] Sometimes you'll know what's happening.
[2:27:18] Sometimes you won't know what's
[2:27:19] happening.
[2:27:22] Sometimes your eyes will be closed
[2:27:25] and then Jesus will open your eyes.
[2:27:28] Sometimes you won't understand
[2:27:31] and then Jesus will open your
[2:27:32] understanding.
[2:27:34] Sometimes you won't see it in the Bible
[2:27:38] and then all of a sudden you'll see it
[2:27:39] in the Bible.
[2:27:41] You'll read a scripture, you don't
[2:27:42] understand it,
[2:27:45] and then God will open your
[2:27:46] understanding.
[2:27:48] Why? That's the way you're made.
[2:27:51] And there's a reason for that we're
[2:27:53] going to go into tonight.
[2:27:57] All right. Next.
[2:27:59] Now, Brother Brandham says, "Let me draw
[2:28:01] you a little circle. If I had a
[2:28:02] blackboard, I want you to watch here.
[2:28:11] I'm going to make one ring like this.
[2:28:12] I'm going to make another ring on the
[2:28:14] inside of that ring. That's two. And
[2:28:16] then I'm going to make a ring on the
[2:28:17] inside of that ring. That's three rings,
[2:28:19] three circles.
[2:28:25] Hang on. I have to go really fast.
[2:28:30] Now, that's you. That's God. God in a
[2:28:32] trinity is one. And without a trinity is
[2:28:35] not God. He can't be manifested any
[2:28:37] other way and neither can you be
[2:28:39] manifested without being the trinity
[2:28:41] person that you are. That's body,
[2:28:43] spirit, and soul. Without either one of
[2:28:45] them, you're not complete.
[2:29:15] Amen. All right, keep moving forward
[2:29:17] here.
[2:29:19] First click, there's your body.
[2:29:23] There's your spirit. Next click, there's
[2:29:26] your soul. Abraham says to draw three
[2:29:29] rings.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Next click.
[2:29:38] The soul is you.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Uhhuh.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; So that's who you really are here. Next
[2:29:44] click.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Now in your body.
[2:29:50] next click or sorry in your soul is
[2:29:53] unbelief.
[2:29:57] This is how you're born.
[2:29:59] But in the midst of that soul next
[2:30:01] click,
[2:30:04] there's a seed gene
[2:30:07] waiting to be quickened.
[2:30:11] This is every baby.
[2:30:13] This is every unredeemed person.
[2:30:17] That's an elect of God.
[2:30:21] All right, next click.
[2:30:25] One more.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Not sure what happened there. Keep
[2:30:31] going. Next one. Oh, here we go. Now,
[2:30:34] Brother Brandham, in the message,
[2:30:35] leadership,
[2:30:39] he says, "You're either for God or
[2:30:41] against God. The outward expression
[2:30:42] shows exactly what's on the inside.
[2:30:54] And the cocoa may of you think I got the
[2:30:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to
[2:30:59] heaven.
[2:31:06] No sir, you can have the baptism of the
[2:31:08] Holy Ghost. Or he says that don't mean
[2:31:10] one thing, you're going to heaven. No
[2:31:12] sir, you can have the baptism of the
[2:31:13] Holy Ghost every hour in your life and
[2:31:16] still be lost and go to hell.
[2:31:32] And many people stumble over this quote
[2:31:37] because they don't read the next quote.
[2:31:42] And then brother round says right after
[2:31:43] this.
[2:31:48] Yeah. One more. He says, "Look here. You
[2:31:52] are an outside person. You have five. Go
[2:31:55] ahead.
[2:31:59] You have five senses that contacts the
[2:32:01] outside body.
[2:32:06] God gave you five senses not to contact
[2:32:08] him your earthly home. See, feel
[2:32:11] smelling here.
[2:32:24] Then you have a spirit on the inside of
[2:32:26] that
[2:32:31] and it has five outlets. Conscience and
[2:32:33] love and so forth.
[2:32:40] Five outlets that you contact the spirit
[2:32:42] world with that but with your spirit.
[2:32:53] Your physical contacts the physical.
[2:32:55] Amen.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual contacts the spiritual.
[2:33:03] But inside of that you've got a soul.
[2:33:06] The soul is the gene that come from God.
[2:33:18] So now what brother is brother Brandham
[2:33:20] doing here?
[2:33:22] He's explaining how you can have the
[2:33:23] Holy Ghost and go to hell.
[2:33:29] And he breaks it down into the three
[2:33:31] parts that you are.
[2:33:35] Body, spirit, soul.
[2:33:38] So that's what we're going to do.
[2:33:41] Next one.
[2:33:44] Like a baby formed in its mother's womb.
[2:33:46] The baby comes to mother's womb. Little
[2:33:48] germ. It crawls into the egg. It doesn't
[2:33:49] form one cell. Human, dog, cat, horse.
[2:33:52] It's all human cells.
[2:34:25] All right. And when a man's been born
[2:34:28] again by the word of God,
[2:34:34] predestinated to eternal life
[2:34:38] called the elected,
[2:34:42] it'll be word of God on top of word,
[2:34:45] word on word.
[2:34:53] We're going to leave that there and move
[2:34:54] on.
[2:34:57] So here's your body,
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; your spirit
[2:35:03] and your soul.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; In your body, you have five senses.
[2:35:09] See, taste, feel, smell, and hear.
[2:35:18] In the spirit, you have five channels.
[2:35:24] But your soul
[2:35:26] is either faith or unbelief.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, stay with me here.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; One click.
[2:35:42] In your spirit, you become
[2:35:46] deformed.
[2:35:51] The devil uses your imagination to
[2:35:54] create worry.
[2:36:00] Worry is worry is simply the misuse of
[2:36:03] imagination. Is the misuse misuse of
[2:36:06] imagination.
[2:36:11] You imagine things, you worry about them
[2:36:13] and they never happen.
[2:36:18] It's a perversion of your imagination.
[2:36:23] Next one
[2:36:27] you devil likes to take your reasoning
[2:36:29] and turn it into insanity or pride or
[2:36:32] other things.
[2:36:40] Now remember these channels were created
[2:36:42] by God.
[2:36:46] Brother says in greatest battle ever
[2:36:47] fought
[2:36:51] that these channels need to be cleaned
[2:36:52] out.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Next one. Henry.
[2:36:58] All right. Then we con and your
[2:36:59] conscience can easily be moved by the
[2:37:01] devil into condemnation and legalism.
[2:37:10] And people's consciences become
[2:37:12] perverted.
[2:37:16] into legalistic ideas
[2:37:20] by the devil.
[2:37:24] Let me give you an example.
[2:37:26] I was preaching years ago at a men's
[2:37:28] meeting,
[2:37:31] 200 men
[2:37:33] with questions and answers.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; And someone wrote a question in
[2:37:40] said, "I I committed fornication before
[2:37:44] I was saved. Does that mean I cannot
[2:37:48] minister?
[2:38:00] Now you're all waiting on the edge of
[2:38:02] your seats.
[2:38:09] And I I told brother Barry Coffee who
[2:38:11] was running the meeting.
[2:38:15] I said, "Give me that question."
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Barry Coffee.
[2:38:21] Okay.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; His name is Barry Coffee
[2:38:27] Coffee.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; The meeting was not being run on coffee.
[2:38:30] [laughter]
[2:38:43] I said, "Listen,
[2:38:45] if committing fornication
[2:38:49] means you cannot minister,
[2:38:54] no one has a right to minister."
[2:39:00] For Jesus said,
[2:39:02] "If a man look upon a woman
[2:39:06] to lust after her in his heart, he has
[2:39:11] committed adultery."
[2:39:14] I said, "So it's not the physical act.
[2:39:19] It's if you even thought wrong in your
[2:39:22] mind.
[2:39:25] And in this day and age
[2:39:28] where one of the problems of the age,
[2:39:32] the immorality of women,
[2:39:35] immorality, immorality.
[2:39:39] Tell me someone without the Holy Ghost
[2:39:42] that never lusted after a woman.
[2:39:49] Well, it's quiet in here. I guess I I
[2:39:51] stepped on an African doctrine here.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; I'll let brother Steven and brother
[2:39:57] James deal with that one.
[2:40:07] wants to take your conscience and form
[2:40:10] legalism with it.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; Because there's scriptures you can take
[2:40:21] and tie regarding fornication, adultery,
[2:40:24] women, harlots, different things, and
[2:40:26] tie it all together and say, "No, you
[2:40:28] can't minister.
[2:40:39] But now I know a prophet
[2:40:42] and I'm not I'm not making a doctrine
[2:40:44] out of this, okay?
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; I know a prophet
[2:40:50] who helped a harlot
[2:40:53] in an insane institution
[2:40:57] get delivered
[2:41:00] and get the Holy Ghost.
[2:41:02] and he said about her,
[2:41:05] she would make a good minister's wife.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I've just given all kinds of
[2:41:15] problems to these brothers here
[2:41:20] [laughter]
[2:41:22] and I'll let them deal with it.
[2:41:26] But my point is
[2:41:29] channels in your spirit.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; The devil knows how to twist them up.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; He takes your affections and turns it to
[2:41:42] worship.
[2:41:44] Affection. Affections.
[2:41:51] Uhhuh.
[2:41:54] Okay. So,
[2:42:01] all right.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Henry. He takes your memory
[2:42:08] turns us to stars, scars and complexes.
[2:42:16] So that your human spirit,
[2:42:20] your human spirit
[2:42:22] that was made that way by God,
[2:42:26] by experiences,
[2:42:28] false teaching,
[2:42:31] false understanding,
[2:42:34] twisted up,
[2:42:36] but God doesn't want you to stay that
[2:42:38] way.
[2:42:44] All right, let's move forward now.
[2:42:47] Henry. Henry. Now,
[2:42:51] something's going to happen here.
[2:42:54] Try one more.
[2:42:56] There we go. When the Holy Spirit comes
[2:42:58] into the body realm
[2:43:04] or we'll say the anointing comes on your
[2:43:06] flesh,
[2:43:09] it affects the senses of the flesh.
[2:43:13] You might see something.
[2:43:17] The Bible says they saw licks of fire on
[2:43:20] each one.
[2:43:23] Is that the upper room?
[2:43:27] Bible says they heard the sound like a
[2:43:29] rushing mighty wind.
[2:43:35] You might feel the presence of God.
[2:43:39] It's just your body realm.
[2:43:44] You can be baptized in your body and go
[2:43:47] to hell.
[2:43:54] But let's uh now it comes a little bit
[2:43:56] deeper.
[2:43:58] The spirit moves into your spirit realm.
[2:44:03] Something is supposed to happen here
[2:44:04] when the spirit comes into the spirit.
[2:44:10] It gives you a new spirit.
[2:44:14] The Holy Spirit comes into your spirit
[2:44:18] and it cleanses you.
[2:44:21] God says, "I'll give you a new spirit,
[2:44:25] not a different spirit,
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; but I'll renew your spirit."
[2:44:32] Amen. Just like he says, "I I I saw a
[2:44:34] new heaven and a new earth.
[2:44:39] It wasn't a different heaven.
[2:44:43] It was an earth that had been cleansed."
[2:44:48] So when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[2:44:51] human spirit,
[2:44:54] it gives you an experience,
[2:44:58] not a fleshly feeling. Now,
[2:45:01] many times it's an emotion.
[2:45:06] And brother Ram says we're human beings.
[2:45:07] We have emotions.
[2:45:11] But that's not the new birth.
[2:45:14] But brother Brown said the birds sing
[2:45:16] nicer.
[2:45:18] The birds sing nicer.
[2:45:22] The sun shines brighter.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Your spirit has been cleansed.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; And he says you have to be careful.
[2:45:35] He says you'll think you're born again,
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; but you're not.
[2:45:42] That's just a new spirit.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; You can go that far and go to hell every
[2:45:52] day. Go to hell.
[2:45:56] That's why even that's why even people
[2:45:58] like the Pentecostals, they like to come
[2:46:00] together and have an emotional
[2:46:02] experience.
[2:46:09] They renew their spirit.
[2:46:13] to change the soul.
[2:46:16] But now be careful.
[2:46:18] It's also the reason you need to come to
[2:46:20] church.
[2:46:23] You need to gather together.
[2:46:27] As you rub shoulders with evil out there
[2:46:29] in the world,
[2:46:35] the devil will put things in your mind
[2:46:40] from the music,
[2:46:42] from the internet, from different
[2:46:44] things.
[2:46:46] We can come to church like Acts chapter
[2:46:48] 5.
[2:46:52] The Bible says they were all gathered
[2:46:54] together.
[2:46:55] They're
[2:46:57] not all filled with the Holy Ghost,
[2:47:00] including the ones that already were
[2:47:02] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:47:06] Why? Because we even being born again,
[2:47:08] we need refillings.
[2:47:17] There's a supernatural aspect.
[2:47:22] But don't stop here.
[2:47:24] Next one.
[2:47:29] Next one.
[2:47:31] When the spirit comes into the soul,
[2:47:35] now something happens.
[2:47:38] Hallelujah.
[2:47:39] Now unbelief is all burned. Now
[2:47:45] the seed gene of God has been quickened.
[2:47:50] There's no more unbelief.
[2:47:54] It's not just a new spirit.
[2:47:57] It's not just a new heart.
[2:48:01] God's spirit
[2:48:04] in you
[2:48:06] quickening [screaming] that CG.
[2:48:10] See to understand this you have to
[2:48:13] understand what John the Baptist was
[2:48:14] saying.
[2:48:17] God is commissioned.
[2:48:20] The angel of the Lord said
[2:48:23] said, "Upon whom you see the spirit
[2:48:25] descending and remaining on
[2:48:31] now the spirit descended on him manyis
[2:48:38] prophesied.
[2:48:41] The spirit descended on him."
[2:48:44] But he didn't just say descending.
[2:48:47] He said and remaining.
[2:48:50] Hallelujah.
[2:48:52] He was the manifested word for that
[2:48:54] hour. [screaming]
[2:48:58] You are the manifested word of this
[2:49:00] hour.
[2:49:05] God's [screaming] spirit
[2:49:07] by the anointed word.
[2:49:14] There is no more unbelief left in there.
[2:49:19] You are changed.
[2:49:22] You [screaming] are baptized with the
[2:49:23] Holy Ghost with fire.
[2:49:28] You have [screaming] taken on the nature
[2:49:29] of God.
[2:49:33] You have manifested a son of God.
[2:49:36] [screaming]
[2:49:39] You can no more doubt
[2:49:43] because there's no more doubts in you.
[2:49:49] Can I make mistakes, Brother Tim?
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's still this stinking thing on
[2:49:59] the outside.
[2:50:03] But when this part makes a mistake,
[2:50:07] faith says that's not in the word of
[2:50:09] God. [screaming]
[2:50:14] And quickly you repent,
[2:50:18] become subject to the word of God.
[2:50:23] That is the reality of the new birth.
[2:50:29] [screaming]
[2:50:35] Brother Brown says, "I was born of
[2:50:36] Charles and Ella Brenham.
[2:50:42] In their nature I was a sinner
[2:50:46] of the world a liar.
[2:50:50] All the habits of the world laid right
[2:50:52] in me.
[2:50:57] But down in there too was another nature
[2:51:03] predestinated
[2:51:07] was in there by God.
[2:51:10] Same body, two natures in there.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I only catered to one.
[2:51:21] Well, I only catered to one.
[2:51:26] As it growed, I grew it as a baby.
[2:51:32] First thing you know, I became a liar.
[2:51:35] become everything else that's a sinner
[2:51:39] because I was raised up that way.
[2:51:42] But down in there was a little speck of
[2:51:44] life all
[2:51:51] was it.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; There was another William Brham.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; A little spot of eternal life down there
[2:52:01] from the genes of God.
[2:52:05] The word of God was placed in there.
[2:52:09] Each one of you can think of similar
[2:52:11] things.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; It was working.
[2:52:17] Then I was born again.
[2:52:22] The little life was laying there
[2:52:25] and the life of water was poured upon
[2:52:27] it.
[2:52:31] Then it began to grow.
[2:52:35] Now that old life was forgiven,
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; put in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; To never be remembered against me no
[2:52:48] more.
[2:52:53] Now we stand justified
[2:52:57] as though we never sinned in the
[2:52:59] presence of God.
[2:53:04] And so were you sons and daughters of
[2:53:06] God.
[2:53:09] Before there was a moon, stars or
[2:53:11] molecule,
[2:53:18] you were sons and daughters of God.
[2:53:21] You're only the physical manifestations
[2:53:23] of the attributes that was in God at the
[2:53:25] beginning.
[2:53:32] See, I'm trying to get you to see who
[2:53:33] you are. Son of God, daughter of God.
[2:53:38] I'm not trying to get you to see how you
[2:53:39] feel.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you into an
[2:53:44] emotional experience.
[2:53:48] But if the Holy Spirit can get you into
[2:53:50] a revelation
[2:53:54] that you're a child of the king,
[2:53:59] Amen.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; The gene of your life, spiritual life
[2:54:02] tonight was in God the Father before
[2:54:04] there ever was a molecule. Amen.
[2:54:18] You're nothing but these of the gene of
[2:54:20] life that was in God as a son of God.
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; Now you're expressed. His word has come
[2:54:27] in you to light up this age.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; Let me come and
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; you got it.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Let me get it.
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; Do you get
[2:54:46] Give me the
[2:55:06] Henry,
[2:55:08] that little germ of life, that gene of
[2:55:12] God that we just talked talked about
[2:55:13] that attribute that come down from God
[2:55:15] and has been manifested here to honor
[2:55:17] and glorify God.
[2:55:34] We're closing now.
[2:55:43] Keep going.
[2:55:46] Keep going.
[2:55:50] All right. Keep going. We're going to
[2:55:52] have to skip this. Sorry. Keep going. It
[2:55:55] must be accepted in the mind. Then it's
[2:55:57] believed in the heart. Then the word of
[2:55:58] God becomes a reality. Then every senses
[2:56:01] of soul and body is just scoured out
[2:56:03] with the Holy Spirit.
[2:56:26] Next.
[2:56:28] Next.
[2:56:29] Next.
[2:56:31] We're done. All right.
[2:56:34] Who are you?
[2:56:39] You were a hidden attribute of the life
[2:56:41] of God when you came into this world.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; But the word has come to show you who
[2:56:52] you are.
[2:56:57] That's why brother Brandham could say
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; one day I realized
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not the son of Charles and Ella
[2:57:06] Brandom.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; The old William Brham is dead.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; I always was.
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; always will be
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; a son of God.
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; That's why God
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; sent his word
[2:57:33] &gt;&gt; to quicken you.
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; And you are living in the greatest age
[2:57:39] there's ever been
[2:57:44] called in the Bible the manifestation or
[2:57:46] revelation of the sons of God.
[2:57:53] That time is now.
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; Your revelation
[2:57:59] is here.
[2:58:01] It's all laying in the message.
[2:58:05] You got troubles.
[2:58:08] Get in the message. You got battles. The
[2:58:12] victory is in the message.
[2:58:14] It's not psychology.
[2:58:16] It's not emotionalism.
[2:58:20] It's not feelings.
[2:58:22] It's not psychology.
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; Psychology is a study of the mind.
[2:58:27] Psychology.
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; Medical science is a study of the body.
[2:58:36] Amen.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; Religion is the study of the soul.
[2:58:43] But the message is the revelation of
[2:58:46] what's in the soul.
[2:58:53] Let's stand together.
[2:58:57] [applause]
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, we held the people a long time
[2:59:03] this morning,
[2:59:06] it takes the Holy Spirit
[2:59:08] to quicken this to the individual.
[2:59:13] If there be somebody in need this
[2:59:15] morning,
[2:59:17] somebody who the devil's tried to hold
[2:59:19] down,
[2:59:23] Lord, may you loose them.
[2:59:25] May you show them, that they're already
[2:59:29] free.
[2:59:32] Show them, Lord, that they're always
[2:59:34] been in your mind
[2:59:38] and there's nothing the devil can do to
[2:59:41] stop your plan in their life.
[2:59:47] We commit it to you now.
[2:59:49] Bless your word. We pray
[2:59:52] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:59:55] Amen.
