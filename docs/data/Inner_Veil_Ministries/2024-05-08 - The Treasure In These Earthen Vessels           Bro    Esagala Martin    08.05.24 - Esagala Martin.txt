Jesus Christ we pray amen you may take your seat I want to appreciate uh my pastors for this opportunity they have given me to stand before you I believe it's it is humbling and uh a little bit nervous standing here I'm depending on your prayers so this evening by the grace of God I want to share with you about the treasure in these a vessels praise the name of the Lord and uh I just want to begin with a quote here in the message the Waters of Separation The Prophet side what taken place they go two Turtle does killed one over an Ann vessel with running water poured its blood into a Earthly vessel the Earthly vessel speaking of Christ's humility Christ humiliating himself coming down taking on an Earthly vessel and over the running water which the water which the water in that place spoke of the spirit praise the name of the Lord and one dove was killed and in this was put Ceda scarlet and he and the he sprinkled the living bird the living bird was taken out in a field and turned loose and when its Little Wings was a flattering and flying like that with the blood of its dead M on it for a cleansing of leprosy which is a type of sin was a type of the church with the blood of the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who died in your state and the blood and the blood cried holy and unto the Lord and the blood sprinkling the ground holy holy holy unto the Lord a cleansing of leprosy praise the name of the Lord so here the prophet was speaking uh an inspiration fromus 14 Leviticus chter 14 concerning the cleansing of the leper so the prophet says and indeed when you read that that chapter you will find that that the Le for him to be cleansed the scripture says he had to take two totals and take them to the priest to kill one of the totals and one was left to go free but the blood of this toled on the other and the prophet say that this is an example over our Lord Jesus Christ coming to die for us that his blood might be sprinkled upon the church moving here to another place we are crying holy holy holy amen so when the prophet talks about Jesus Christ being humiliated Jesus Christ humilating himself coming down to this earth here taking on the Earthly vessel and when the prophet talks about the Earthly vessel he talking about the body of Flesh he's talking about this body of mine and yours he's talking about flesh and blood so he says Christ was humilated this flesh here to walk around and die for our sins that we might be redeemed praise the name of the Lord so the Earth vessel that's what we are referring to this evening there the scripture has told us that there is a treasure praise the name of the Lord and what is the treasure treasure is a store of precious [Music] je a treasure is a storage of things that are Priceless praise the name of the Lord and in these vsels you find that we cry [Music] he says we have trouble on every side let's continue with the scripture in second Corinthians chter 4 inse say but we have this treasure in a vels that the Excellence of the power may be of God not us and then he continues and says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed and then he say we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed so in this body that we live in we have a lot of troubles that surround us and the TR they not going away now because the scripture says the book of chter 14 14 the scripture says from verse one job 14 verse1 man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble so the scripture is talking about man of Flesh and Blood and the troubles are there the rest of this life here you leave one trouble you enter into another you leave one you don't need and then you enter into another you leave one you need not enter another so man that is born of woman is a few days and the few days full of trbl the scripture has told us also that this man is perplexed praise the name of the Lord and being perplexed being perplexed is to be without resources is to be in straight is to be left wanting you know to be embarrassed to be in doubt praise the name of the Lord not to know which way to turn to and the Greek Leon says that that is being perplexed so this body is perplexed you and I we are perplexed several times because we are seeing this vessel prise the name of the Lord and this body here persecuted still the SC says we are persecuted in this vessel PR the name of the Lord and the also say that we are cast down this might be a failure challenge you expect to do something and maybe someone has let you down but what does the scripture says we are never you know we never give up upon it let's get back to that scripture second Corinthians chapter 5 he says we are persecuted but yet not for seconden there for us all the time when we are persecuted praise the name of the Lord and he says we are troubled on every side we encamped around and we are fighting was every day not fighting against one another fighting the enemy Satan he enters one of us to persecute another he ENT your neighbor persecute you praise the name of the Lord but the scripture says that we are not forsaken praise the name of the Lord and he says we are cast down you see you want to do something that person I want you to do for me and the person cast you down person fails you the person maybe disappoints you the scripture says that you know he says but not destroy for so there the life that is to come we have has last this one has last and sickness and death because what is it it is not the house that has gone to be prepared praise the name of the Lord this is a best house how many knows what a past house is that is what you are living in a past house is where they put all the the the diseased people well that is just what sin done to us put us in in another pest house they wouldn't let anyone else come in the pest house because there is all kinds of jams flying around there and the people will take these jams and be sick praise the name of the Lord so the prophet is pointing us that this still Earth vessel is a past house it is full of diseases you heal you get healed of this one tomorrow you contact another it is the a vessel it is a best house praise the name of the Lord so this best house here does not you know change what God sees us in that is a great nugget this house does not change who we are in the sight of God I might be going through a disease today but yet in the sight of the Lord I'm his son I might be going through trials today but yet in the sight of the Lord I'm his precious son I might be going through troubles today but yet in the house of the Lord in the sight of the Lord I'm his precious son so the conditions that the best house is going through does it you know determine what God sees in you praise the name of the Lord he says now listen what the prophet says here in another message Israel and the church he says now if you just quit doing it because you know you ought to do it and quit doing it this and quit doing this that's a say that you haven't got nowhere yet when that thing becomes dead in you and the nature of it gone away the prophet says that when that thing becomes dead in you the nature of going away there is another person in there it can only produce the holy ghost that was in Christ in you produces the Christlike life nothing you do what he did he was that before the foundation of the world well I got saved because I qu smoking and then he says also the prophetes and says that wasn't why got said that wasn't why you got sa you you got sa because God chose you before the foundation of the praise the name of the Lord to be saved that is the scripture teaching amen now you see we begin to find out it's not us it is him he chose us when did he choose us even when we were still smoking he chose us and then the prophet says Abraham couldn't say bless God well bless God I come down from the Tower of Babylon hallelujah hallelujah that's why I got sa he wouldn't have saved the he would have saved the whole bunch then if that is the reason they done so the prophet is telling us if Abraham leaving the tower of babon was what saved him then God would have saved all of them praise the name of the Lord so the condition of Abraham isn't the reason he was saved the condition you know your this evening isn't the reason why yourself God elected you before the foundation of the world and that why you sitting praise the name of the Lord the prophet says he elected Abraham and that was the very beginning of our Salvation was given to man when he called him and elected him and predestinated him and gave him a promise and made a covenant with AB anded forever so this evening this AEL might be going through trials of time might be having a disease the P house this Earth anival they that treasure prise the name of the Lord that's why Paul says in the book of Acts 26 verse 22 having therefore obtained help of God help I continue this day witnessing both to small and great says it is not me that does the work this V can fail each day but the treasure that is in work praise the name of the Lord and then he says in verse 23 that Grace should suffer and that he should be first that should rise from the dead 26 ver 23 Acts chapter 26 verse 22 vers praise the name of the Lord so let's get back to our to our text this evening in the book of second Corinthians 4 the scripture told us for God who commanded the L to shine out of Darkness shed in our hearts now I want you to see this it is not the L that God created he says for God who commanded and then he says heart shined in our hearts so it is God that is shining in our hearts praise the name of the Lord and then he says to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and then he says in verse seven but we have this treasure now Paul is talking about the treasure and this treasure here that is talking about is God shining in our hearts that he speaks about in verse that God is shining in our heart and that is the treasure that we have and now that treasure brings about the Excellence of the power of God is shown out through us not us ourselves but the glory of the Lord the of God so that's why I'm saying that God himself has shown in our heart it is not the light that he commanded to shine in the beginning we see on Earth theate God himself that's the treasure in us and Ron chter 5 verse the scripture says and hope make not ashamed hope make us not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so the love of God that is shown in our hearts that is sheded in our hearts com by the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord and now this Holy Ghost here comes in our hearts and brings all the attributes of God in our hearts praise the name of the Lord and that's why John says beloved let us love one another for love is of God love is of God he says that love is God so you got to be with God in your heart for you to have love in your heart and the prophet also says here I just want to bring it here where he says that uh in the message you must be born again he says but without that eternal life this Fellowship life it will F away praise the name of the Lord is that strange he says without that eternal life this Fellowship life it will F away because it had a beginning it will have but with eternal life can nor more die than Eternal eternity can itself and what is eternity A Perfect Circle A Perfect Circle that has no end just revolves it he started it laying around this way it will go through the table through the flow through the Earth it is still a perfect circle and God had no beginning had no end and when he puts that spirit in us the treasure he says when he puts that spirit in Us in this flesh that he has brought from the earth and our F love has become to a place that it is overr by then we go praise the name of the Lord he says when [Applause] the has been replaced and you know placed was placed was and over etal in this that's been F and BR from the earth praise the name of the lord' to allow the love of God we got to allow know The Treasure of the Holy Spirit shed in our hearts continue revealing the treasures of all the attributes of God in us daily you see you know because the failures may come but that doesn't change the attribute that is in your heart because it is not this flesh that is producing that something coming from inside is being shed by the holy GH praise the name of the Lord and Pastor Rec shared in the group a certain quot and that was a great nugget to me I just want to share it with he says the prophet says in the message they were to have Fellowship I would rather have a church listen just a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be in love with each other and with Christ I would rather have done than every gift GI operating in the church why because Love Is God himself you canot produce that love without having that treasure in your life without having that treasure in your heart praise the name of the Lord the prophet says where there is a gift there will be question but where there is love it is perfect why it is God himself he has come and start inside of you amid all trials all troubl love stays there is a Conant it is a Conant because God is constant in you prise the name of the Lord God has changed in our hearts theol ghost as the Holy Ghost he has shown in our heart as the Holy Ghost why one to reveal himself to the world praise the name of the Lord if you ever come across the message Christ the Myster of the of God revealed the prophet was talking about the three F purpose of Christ coming but now this evening I want us to take those threefold purposes as those are the reason why the Holy Ghost is shown in our because he want reveal himself the people around you God you know wants to use you to through you to speak to your neighbor for your neighbor to know indeed God is leaving and he's in the people then the other reason is for God to have the preeminence within you you see to to rule such that you can surrender to him when he's right in your heart that's why he comes as the hoost in you and then the third reason to restore his kingdom in your life to take out the F of Satan and build up his kingdom in you are the purposes why God want to dwell in you and why he has shown himself in you why he's in you praise the name of the Lord and when the scripture say that it is the holy ghost that is the channel that God is in your life the prophet says here that the Holy Ghost is not auth now listen here the prophet says in the message says we will see Jesus there is Dr Morris who was asking him why is Jesus and maybe maybe one of us is having this question the prophet but where is that Jesus Dr Morris reard the president of the great Sudan Mission the greatest in the world came to me recently and in the room and in the room and in the room he said brother Bram I have enough degrees with h de to your [Music] but he said he said but where is Christ in any of it has the teachers been wrong I said I would not wish to say that I said as a person with grammar school education I could not say that those great F teachers has been wrong but they've told you the truth but Christ doesn't go by degre that you get here through theology Christ is by fa he is not a myth he is a person and then he says the holy spirit is not a thought it is a person when he the Holy Ghost and he is a personal pronoun absolutely it's a person of Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit Jesus said I am the vine you are the branches now the vine does not bear fruit the branches bears fruit so therefore he has to use you and I and ey he says he has to use you and our eyes our lips our hearing our speech that is him speaking through us I am the vine he are the branches so it would be the ass of Christ in his people if you could see him acting today like he for it is a promise to his church in me and my word in you ask what you will oh so many thousand of promises could be quoted here is Christ in his church what we have did among all of us I suppose I'm in a mixed audience as usual but what we have did we have arated Christ with an intellectual conception of some historical God if he AAL godal God what good will he do to us if he isn't the same God to this generation as he was at the apostolic age what good will that God of Moses do he what good would a healing God do that heal the sick back in him is and if he isn't the same today praise the name of the Lord so the prophet is showing us that this Christ here coming in Us in the form of the Holy Spirit it is not a thought that you say oh maybe I have it is a sure that you have it because of the life you live the prophet tells us that is not stimulation is not sensation it is the life that is the evidence life I may jump but yet the life doesn't take but the life of the holy spirit is the evidence that the person is in and he's working his way out PR the name of the Lord it is not here from outside and that's why our life is a the trials may come you know try to fail this yet because what is inside is our life doesn't change because we are not living our own life we are living the life of God that's why the prophet has told us that what we see with our eyes what how we use our lips our mouth it is Christ because he's inside he has the preeminence praise the name of the Lord so that Christ ising through you and he is the reason why amidst all the trials around still strong and of the Lord what is the reason why amst all the diseases around you stand and say I'm Healed in the name of Jesus Christ listen the prophet says here in the of Jesus Christ he says the de of him who is he praise the name of the Lord he say some of them think little baby back there remember we are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ that is showed in our hearts that is shed in our heart where the scripture has told us that same God commanded the light been shown in our hearts that same God the that we are talking about and the prophet says he is the you know he says some of them think that that him a little back back there is the one that stood on the invisible the invisible platform reached out his hand and spoke and let be light now the prophet is trying that some people still see him in the mang and they say he's in the hands of the man us he is one that stood on the invisible platform and reached out his hand and spoke and say Let There be late and there was that was Jesus Jesus Christ he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was and he is the de of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous there you talk about shouting when he perform the miraculous things to make things which are now which was not SP and it was so power that same Christ hallelujah hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it is wrong but that same power that brought the world into existence is in those people that's the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord oh my that's right men and women is time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to H you back tell you that you are some little throw down something that you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you are some little down something you are not you are Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it is in you hallelujah hallelujah and then he says I I know you think I'm Christ let me tell you something when you realize that almighty God lives in youal life Immortal Life my life I give the life of God is in the human being and then he says in the of Jesus Christ Parra he stood back there he's the great of all things he made life frogs and those dos chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but what was made by him Christ the deity he brought down Place everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the M of lions heed the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised the Dead from the grave Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ Prophet says here and brother sister that is in you the see me no will be with you even in you to the end of the world was that Christ in the manger say no Christ in you hallelujah hallelujah we are not worshiping Christ in the major the Holy Ghost the hope of Life The Creator God dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we we will be made like him praise the name of the Lord the prophet is trying to tell us Christ the deity life into existence the deity that brought the water in the wilderness that was there and healed Le man that made each and everything that we see living in you as the Holy Ghost he says the de Su of it's not in heaven because it is in you what a treasure that's why a trie stand tall praise the name of the Lord amidst all the diseases stand say Oh Glory to God whatever it is it will come down whatever it is it will come down why the praise the name the prophetes people around here saying their church is of Christ and what happened last night open up their Christmas presents let see about daddy let's see about daddy let us see about that in there now he's talking about the Christmas gift that they had under the Christmas tree of a man of of a many a man last night set a big box set a big box ofwhere repeat it here in where it begins from yes people around here saying that they are of Christ their church is of Christ that they go to and what happened last night opened up their Christmas presents in there there is there is there was under the Christmas tree of many a man last night set a big box of beer somewhere a du of cards a dark of cards a du of cards no room for Christ but that's right instead of a little aesome children it's a little g b or a little something like that no room for instead of going to church they go to shows dances everything and call now this is where I want us to go when the de of God comes into the human heart it cools out everything that Christ hasn't created you know that's the truth praise the name of the Lord so we have seen that Christ is dwelling in us and it is the it is the treasure that Paul talks about talks about you know being perplexed and you have not given up and indeed this evening whatever you're going through you all to know that whatsoever comes your way as long as that treasure is there you will not be defeated yes sir because maybe let's look at that scripture [Music] let's go to the book of second [Music] Timothy on chapter 3 let's begin from first but thou Hast fully known my [Music] Doctrine manner of life purpose fa long suffering Char patience 11 persecutions came unto me at anti Anon atra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me did you overcome them by himself he says the Lord delivered me where is he the treasure in this vessel praise the name of the Lord as I try to finish here let's just look at where the Prophet is talking about here you see job also was a little bit confused because things were not moving on Camp us around trials that many times I asked my brothers and sisters that if you stood in the feet of job what would you do but the prophet says in the message go tell my disciples go tell my disciples and then paragraph 43 I think of prophet job when he said there at that time and he knew he was going he spoke of the Great someone there that we get from Job 14 how he watched flowers how they died and R how he washed the trees if it blows over tears down the wind tears up the wind tears up in depth in death rather in death yet it lives a g he said through a few drops he says it lives we watch our animals and so forth as they and as they live and die everything that has a moving being about it when it dies it never lives normal so job wondered how it was that God could take a flower and make it live again and yet he couldn't live again that is job he wondered why God allows the flower to live again he has not allowed job himself man in this again and the prophet and says couldn't live again he said a man give up the ghost he was away and where is he he said his sons come to honor him but he perceive it not then he said oh that would that thou would hide me in the grave and th would keep me in a secret place until they wrath be passed th appoint me at times and Bs and Bones I cannot pass but if thou would just keep me in the secret place the day of the right in the midst of [Music] his right well the very darkest of the hour was well the very dark of the hour just in that crucial moment then [Music] and begin to speak to him telling him that the flower had not sinned that he was the one that sin and there would be a resurrection someday there would be a just one who would come made conformable to this world and in the form of God's image after after the fashion of man praise the name of the Lord so here that came was telling that it is because of your sins that you're going through this that is because of the sins that you will not resurrect and the prophet continues here and says and when job saw that he was looking to the resurrection of the Lord saw it now notice in other words job was trying to get this that I know that when a man goes to the dust of the earth he just contaminates and goes away I watch him he never raises a g he just lays down and gives up the goost before realizing that in him was a treasure he thought that when he's going to die he will not come up again praise the name of the Lord and then he says in paragraph 47 there then he says then when this prophet got in the spirit God begin to show him what was going to take place that there would be someone who would take away the sin of the world and raise a again he saw the resurrection of the Lord then I love that when I think he said stood up he shook himself he would been sitting on our ship my what we call today had hit his house his children was all killed his riches was all gone his health had broken down him sitting a Christian or believer sitting for seconden for seconden a man even his church had turned there back on him sitting there scrapping his bra at the condition of Jo and the prophet says and then when the spirit of the Lord Came Upon you know he stood up and he said I know my redeemer and at the last days he will stand on the earth and though the skin ones destroyed this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see he knew he would see him the last day because there would be a resurrection how about us who are living in the present you know you know revealed what where the holy spirit is given before them the Holy Spirit was not given here the treasure is dwelling right us Christ in his people doing his work praise the name of the Lord we might be going through different trials but the treasure the anchor is holding so I just want to encourage that the treasure that is in this body is what keeps us going you see when you look at the scriptures you may wonder [Music] why for all the treasures in Egypt and he suffered with with God's people may wonder what what what happen to David when he came to the brothers in the Battleground and his his his you know his Revelation wasn't the army of s it wasn't the army of it was the army of the Living God why he had the Revelation there is a treasure there is a God and this evening what we need to know that in Us in this body that suffer sickness in this body you know that is that fails there is a treasure the holy spirit is shown in us and that Holy Spirit does not fail ConEd everything the prophet says that Christ conquered everything just in us to fulfill all that is done praise the name of the Lord so you wonder why Paul such a great Apostle stands in Romans 7 when I want to good but how did you overc by the treasure in theel let's just sing one more song here then we shall pray each one of us as we appreciate God for the treasure in praise the name of the Lord it is a great blessing to know that in this pest house there is a great [Music] treasure and every time we should think about that we should give God the glory because he knew that we can't overcome and then the scripture says that there is nothing that comes your way except he the de that is dwelling in you so that he will enable you overcome the name of the Lord amen that's song 25 I Surrender I Surrender amen amen oh to Jesus surrender oh to him my free [Music] Hallelujah but love unrust [Music] him his praise you surrender this evening surrender [Music] Hallelujah I [Music]
