[29:11] foreign
[30:17] [Music]
[30:36] because the atmosphere is set for
[30:38] everyone to be set free
[30:41] so when the word of God comes
[30:44] it comes in a fertile ground
[30:47] where there is Faith to receive it is
[30:51] and it does a lot of money
[30:54] it brings Great Harvest
[31:01] oh it is still sunny ground
[31:04] or it is a website ground
[31:07] then you cannot bring any fruit to
[31:10] perfection
[31:31] praise the name of our Lord
[31:34] do we have people coming here for the
[31:36] first time she could raise your hand and

[32:19] we shall be doing baptism after this
[32:22] service
[32:25] is there another person to be baptized
[32:27] if you have never received water baptism
[32:36] yes you're welcome also says
[32:43] yesterday I was thinking already we need
[32:47] to challenge ourselves
[32:50] at least invite somebody to come with
[32:52] you to church
[32:58] brought somebody this week
[33:01] what about others
[33:04] praise the name of Allah talk to the
[33:07] your colleagues
[33:10] talk to your fellow students talk to
[33:13] your neighbors
[33:14] talk to your family members who have not
[33:17] yet believed
[33:18] and come with them to church even the
[33:22] person who helps you never know
[33:26] talk to them
[33:28] you know everybody needs Christ
[33:32] and at the end of the road
[33:36] it's not the houses we have that are
[33:38] going to matter
[33:40] it's not the joke that we have that are
[33:43] going tomorrow
[33:44] it's not the education with God that's
[33:46] going to matter
[33:48] it's not you know the people we've
[33:50] brought on us
[33:53] husband I've married or wife of marriage
[33:58] but what will matter
[34:00] if you get into the new life because
[34:04] which person have you brought it praise
[34:07] the name of it we're not going to have
[34:09] new house we're not carrying anything
[34:11] from us here is
[34:16] brought to Christ so you need to
[34:19] challenge yourself
[34:21] how many have you brought to
[34:24] christu you may not be able to preach to
[34:27] them but to encourage them come and
[34:30] we'll go with you to church

[43:15] foreign
[43:39] father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:41] Christ
[43:42] we again thank you Father
[43:44] for the things that you do in our
[43:47] meetings the burdens that you put upon
[43:50] our hearts
[43:51] that we can't be in your services all
[43:54] the time
[43:55] I pray for more grace
[43:57] that you may help every one of us to
[44:02] find their positions and also perform
[44:05] the work you've ordained us to do
[44:07] as we build the kingdom of God

[44:16] participate generously
[44:18] also help us in every challenge
[44:24] to be used of your father
[44:27] do what is right and pleasing unto you
[44:30] now commit the reading and the preaching
[44:33] of the words
[44:37] the words of foreign
[44:52] praise the name of our Lord
[44:57] and then we read in verse 5 and verse 6.
[45:03] the Bible says
[45:05] behold I will send you Elijah the
[45:07] prophet before the coming of the great
[45:10] and grateful day of the Lord
[45:19] and he shall turn the heart of the
[45:21] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[45:23] the children to their fathers lest I
[45:26] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[45:38] words
[45:44] I want to talk about a subject
[45:48] the Elijah the prophet of our day area
[45:52] praise the name of our Lord I want to
[45:55] appreciate brother Wilson
[45:57] since last Sunday has been going in this
[46:00] area
[46:02] and I'm also put of God has put a burden
[46:05] upon my hands
[46:07] to speak about the same you know we
[46:11] really talk it here in church
[46:13] but normally when we go to the
[46:15] missionary fields
[46:16] we take time talking to them about the
[46:20] message that God has sent us
[46:23] and many times we Overlook the people in
[46:27] the church
[46:30] yet we have many new people who keep on
[46:32] coming in the church
[46:34] and they may not know why are we doing
[46:37] this now
[46:40] you know God katonda uses the spirit of
[46:45] Elijah
[46:46] five times in the scriptures
[46:51] God uses the spirit of Elijah
[46:56] five times in the scriptures
[46:59] now the first time God used the spirit
[47:02] of Elijah
[47:05] Was Elijah himself
[47:08] and that was in first Kings chapter 17.
[47:12] and then verse and then the scripture
[47:16] says
[47:20] who was of the inhabitants
[47:24] [Music]
[47:26] as the Lord God of Israel leave us
[47:33] there shall not be due nor a Reign this
[47:36] year
[47:39] according to my foreign
[48:14] [Music]
[48:27] foreign
[48:54] [Applause]
[50:10] as if the sins of jeroboam were too
[50:14] small
[50:18] he kept on adding one thing after
[50:21] another
[50:22] question the Bible says he took to wife
[50:26] Jezebel the daughter of Isabel yes
[50:47] he was looking for beauty
[50:49] praise the name of Allah he was looking
[50:52] for how good somebody is how attractive
[50:56] somebody
[50:57] like in the days
[51:00] when the sons of God looked at the
[51:03] daughters of men and they were very
[51:06] famous
[51:07] [Music]
[51:13] and then the Bible says he went down and
[51:17] served
[51:20] [Music]
[51:26] now in other words he was making other
[51:29] gods
[51:30] in addition to the gods of Jeremiah
[51:35] I have added other gods of the region
[51:41] he he built the Bible says
[51:46] and he worshiped
[51:49] in addition to the other gods that
[51:51] jeroboam brought him
[51:54] they took us
[51:56] then the Bible says he went again and
[52:00] the rare than Altar for bad in the house
[52:05] which he had built in summary
[52:10] made a Groove
[52:13] which thing God had rejected
[52:17] and the Bible says
[52:20] the Lord God of Israel foreign
[52:39] he built Jericho
[52:44] he laid the foundation in abilam his
[52:47] first born
[52:50] I said the gates thereof in his youngest
[52:53] son
[52:58] according to the word of the Lord
[53:01] is spoke by Joshua the son of noon
[53:06] you know Joshua told them not to build
[53:08] Jerry yes
[53:20] and when he was building
[53:22] he killed his first born
[53:24] to put the foundation after building it
[53:28] he killed his last born they told me to
[53:31] put the gates
[53:33] that was
[53:34] then God sends Elijah the prophet
[53:38] the condition of all that kind of sins
[53:42] and he said there shall not be Reigns
[53:49] praise the name now we also need to look
[53:52] what the condition we are living
[53:55] we are living in the last
[53:58] box we are living in the Rhodesian
[54:01] Church age
[54:05] the Bible says in Revelations
[54:10] and then verse 14.
[54:14] foreign

[55:39] the rapture

[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:55] at the end time foreign
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:04:26] they have put Christ outside of the
[1:04:28] church
[1:04:29] when they talk about the seeds
[1:04:33] not the word of God no longer interested
[1:04:37] in the world
[1:04:43] they will even deny what is written
[1:04:46] they don't care what you are moving
[1:04:50] Christ is outside
[1:04:53] the Bible says
[1:04:58] the scriptures
[1:05:06] foreign

[1:05:41] and then some of them bring the secular
[1:05:43] musicians
[1:05:45] demon-possessed people to come on
[1:05:49] to sing for the people around to Christ
[1:05:52] praise to outside of the church and
[1:05:55] something like we had recently and
[1:05:58] somebody said I'm organizing a holy
[1:06:00] concert
[1:06:01] and then he brought a sexual musician an
[1:06:06] essential musician was on the front
[1:06:09] portrait um
[1:06:11] and then for him he stood here and let
[1:06:14] me put holy concerts
[1:06:22] Crystal outside of the church
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:57] so we see it's the same condition
[1:07:00] like it was in the days
[1:07:05] so that it is
[1:07:13] and this is the condition of the church
[1:07:16] they think it is a small thing
[1:07:19] they think it's a small things
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:25] foreign
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:08:05] there was some secular music playing
[1:08:07] maybe it was a disco somewhere or some
[1:08:09] open place I don't know
[1:08:12] it was in the night
[1:08:15] now when again I woke up at five times
[1:08:18] they were putting on gospel music
[1:08:22] and I was wondering
[1:08:24] vultures
[1:08:26] praise the name of us they feed on the
[1:08:30] rotten things and then they won't feed
[1:08:32] on the rights
[1:08:37] but that's the condition today
[1:08:40] that until they go to disco
[1:08:43] and then the songs to use for worship
[1:08:47] and that's when the time the songs they
[1:08:49] are using
[1:08:50] to hug one another
[1:08:53] when they are dancing
[1:08:55] foreign
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:08] and then the church has its own
[1:09:10] testimony yeah
[1:09:13] verse 17 of Revelation three okay
[1:09:17] because those sayings
[1:09:22] I am rich
[1:09:25] and increased with God
[1:09:31] that's the testimony of the church
[1:09:33] I'm rich
[1:09:36] prosperity
[1:09:44] [Applause]
[1:09:57] now if you're preaching Prosperity
[1:09:59] Gospel
[1:10:01] what will you preach to a rich man um
[1:10:07] oh you think the rich are not in sin
[1:10:10] obviously if you are preaching salvation
[1:10:13] for people to go to America America When
[1:10:17] You Reach America
[1:10:21] now for your preaching about the Visa
[1:10:24] Visa how about somebody who has got a
[1:10:26] green card of USA
[1:10:29] permanent resident in USA
[1:10:32] what are you going to preach
[1:10:36] Christo outside
[1:10:41] they are building the astric kingdoms
[1:10:45] instead of building the kingdom of God
[1:10:48] which cannot end
[1:10:50] praise the name so Christ is outside of
[1:10:55] the church
[1:10:56] so it is under such a condition
[1:11:00] that God sends a messenger
[1:11:04] in this generation
[1:11:08] it is such a condition
[1:11:10] that God sends Elijah the president
[1:11:16] we sense
[1:11:19] you know you look what the condition of
[1:11:21] the church
[1:11:23] is that they have left the truth
[1:11:27] they have denied the truth
[1:11:30] the condition of the church they refused
[1:11:34] baptizing in the right way
[1:11:37] praise the name of us they baptize in
[1:11:41] the name of the Father the titles
[1:11:42] actually

[1:11:59] go and baptize in the name of the name
[1:12:03] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] how did the apostles do it

[1:13:58] said unto him we have not so much as
[1:14:00] Hardware that there be a Holy Ghost
[1:14:05] and to what way are you baptized

[1:15:57] the child to hell yeah
[1:16:00] when the scripture says
[1:16:02] in Matthew chapter 18.
[1:16:04] and then verse 2. and Jesus called a
[1:16:09] little child unto him yes
[1:16:11] and set him in the midst of them
[1:16:16] very I say unto you remember committee
[1:16:20] except you'll be converted

[1:17:12] and then you scare the mothers what is
[1:17:14] that is
[1:17:17] deception
[1:17:19] praise the name of Allah
[1:17:23] to be baptized
[1:17:27] the Bible says

[1:19:37] child deception
[1:19:41] praise the name of it so there was no
[1:19:44] baptism of little children and even the
[1:19:47] baptisms
[1:19:48] they sprinkle water in the foreign
[1:20:07] Romans chapter six
[1:20:09] and then verse 3.
[1:20:13] no ye not entertainment that so many of
[1:20:17] us were baptizing into Jesus we are
[1:20:20] baptized into his deaths

[1:22:09] so now Elijah played this part
[1:22:13] and then going towards Elijah
[1:22:17] let us go to First Kings again

[1:22:59] told Elijah
[1:23:02] get Elisha the prophet
[1:23:05] and let him wear prophet in your room

[1:23:15] praise the name of it
[1:23:17] Elisha had to follow
[1:23:20] area
[1:23:25] and so now when Elijah was going to be
