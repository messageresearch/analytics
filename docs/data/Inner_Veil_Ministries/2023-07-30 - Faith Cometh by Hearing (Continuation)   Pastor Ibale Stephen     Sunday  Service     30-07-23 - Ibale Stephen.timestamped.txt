[0:00] Chicago
[0:03] are you together with me so this was
[0:06] David and he was under a new testament
[0:10] anointing
[0:12] teaching us but after the Ascension of
[0:16] Christ
[0:22] even without the new birth that is
[0:38] not Romans 10 17.
[0:43] is using that type of thing
[0:47] in Romans 10 17.
[0:50] when he specifically dealing with the
[0:54] new birth
[1:00] even in this message
[1:08] and it causes them to evaluated to
[1:12] ridicule the Teaching Ministry
[1:19] foreign
[1:26] [Music]
[2:22] foreign amen I mean where the brand I'm
[2:25] according to say
[2:27] but teaching blesses a man positionally
[2:31] what he is
[2:36] and we can never rightly be able to have
[2:40] faith that is
[2:51] foreign
[2:53] [Applause]
[2:58] [Applause]
[3:20] [Applause]
[3:36] [Music]
[3:41] foreign
[4:13] why does God allow this anointing
[4:18] and he says to the rebellious
[4:22] why would God allow it right
[4:28] chapter 13.
[4:34] he spoke also this parable
[4:37] [Applause]
[4:39] Monty certain
[4:43] but anyway planted in his Vineyard
[4:50] and salt fruits
[4:58] who is the vineyard planter now
[5:03] but the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:07] and his emphasis is the fruitful tree
[5:21] but then on this particular one
[5:24] the parable is trying to explain the
[5:27] situation
[5:29] he says let me cut it down
[5:35] then say that he entered the dresser
[5:42] behold these three years
[5:45] I come seeking fruits
[5:49] on this fig tree
[5:52] and finance
[6:04] foreign they were getting around this
[6:07] month
[6:08] to protect him because he's in the
[6:12] company
[6:15] let us get him down because he's bearing
[6:19] no
[6:20] fruits
[6:27] answering say that to him
[6:31] again let it alone
[6:42] let us do everything possible
[6:45] let it benefit from the children's food
[6:51] Hallelujah you know the children's Foods
[6:57] [Applause]
[6:58] let them benefits
[7:05] foreign
[7:09] are you together with amazing amen Amina
[7:12] that tree Taps you to the miracle
[7:16] ministry
[7:18] first to see the greater purpose
[7:21] [Applause]
[7:22] of signs and wonders
[7:28] there must be a voice
[7:34] amen amen they just want to tap into the
[7:37] anointing
[7:38] they don't want to get into the teachers
[7:42] we want to see Power to endure
[7:45] Hallelujah you remember the other Sunday
[7:49] perfect strength
[7:52] imperfect weakness
[7:59] the strength of everything
[8:02] that stands
[8:06] amen Amina so down here
[8:09] foreign
[8:24] [Music]
[8:38] that's their qualification
[8:44] chapter 7 verse 22.
[8:48] he says man I will say unto me in that
[8:51] day
[8:53] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[8:59] it was a true anointing
[9:02] that they tapped into
[9:05] and in the name of cast out devils
[9:09] and in thy name done many wonderful
[9:13] words
[9:24] that worked iniquity
[9:30] foreign
[9:40] I never knew you
[9:43] because you never came into the inner
[9:46] chamber
[9:48] um
[9:50] foreign
[10:39] we want to speak
[11:03] you cannot be saved without faith
[11:10] he says yes but a different type of
[11:14] Faith
[11:15] that's the one I want to speak about
[11:20] we've seen all this type of Faith
[11:23] but he's talking about the perfect Faith
[11:26] now
[11:28] a different type of Faith
[11:31] a Saving Face
[11:34] meaning that Romans 10 17.
[11:38] he's dealing with a supernatural face
[11:42] which is the face
[11:45] of Jesus Christ
[11:48] the one that says
[11:52] and produces the fruit
[11:55] in the life of that
[11:58] and once you have this type of faith
[12:01] it will bring victories
[12:05] [Music]
[12:14] foreign
[12:20] [Music]
[12:41] [Music]
[13:03] [Music]
[13:08] the disciples didn't have it
[13:12] till they went to Pentecost
[13:16] but remember they cast out demons
[13:20] by tapping into the anointing
[13:23] but they didn't have that phrase
[13:36] don't dispute that is
[13:38] because the Bible says they even
[13:42] rebellious
[13:48] foreign
[14:10] in the perfect Faith he says
[14:14] now now we see remember
[14:17] that at first okay the disciples did
[14:19] just didn't have this perfect face
[14:23] Did they perform signs
[14:26] yes they did but perfect faith is
[14:32] another type of Faith
[14:36] amen Amina they didn't have it because
[14:40] they are Christ
[14:42] walking with him but then afterwards
[14:46] Christ was in the pressure and so you
[14:50] see it's hard then to have this perfect
[14:54] faith
[14:56] without the Holy Spirit
[14:59] it has to bring it up
[15:21] come on
[15:24] amen
[15:26] are you together with him what is it it
[15:28] is your personal Pentacles
[15:32] that gives this kind of faith is
[15:41] classified to hold that for example
[15:48] Amen in the government government we've
[15:52] got what we call classified documents
[15:59] nobody knows about them
[16:02] if they find you with classified
[16:09] you go to court
[16:11] or yamukoti
[16:13] this face
[16:15] is classified
[16:23] amen Amina it's classified
[16:27] let's go to Revelation 2 17.
[16:34] the scripture says
[16:35] he that has an ear
[16:40] foreign
[17:23] and I want you to listen very well
[17:26] we are trying to get to the bottom of
[17:30] this type of Faith
[17:33] which is
[17:43] because this faith is
[17:51] you have got to pass God has ordained
[17:54] foreign
[18:10] [Applause]
[18:25] [Applause]
[18:40] [Applause]
[18:49] [Applause]
[19:03] [Applause]
[19:21] will bear a certain depth of
[19:33] foreign yeah
[19:35] amen Amina yeah and that one there will
[19:40] also be fruitful
[19:42] and you'll bear fruits
[19:45] he says I'll give you a spiritual
[19:49] certificate certification how much
[19:52] one more year because you have eaten
[19:56] hallelujah praise God I'll give him a
[20:00] white stone
[20:01] and in this town
[20:09] that is white in nature
[20:11] speaks about the Revelation
[20:14] upon which the church is
[20:19] a white Foundation it is
[20:32] [Applause]
[20:35] overcome
[21:13] it changes
[21:34] [Applause]
[21:37] a new
[21:39] way of life
[21:46] are you together with me so this phrase
[21:50] cannot be exchanged
[21:53] because this is the phrase that gives
[21:56] the token
[21:58] and that's why in the separation
[22:02] of the wise and fools
[22:05] they needed some of the face
[22:27] [Applause]
[22:39] [Music]
[23:00] you know foreign
[23:04] [Music]
[23:33] foreign
[23:52] [Music]
[24:21] a belief system
[24:25] so
[24:28] brother brothers
[24:33] let's go to Ephesians one night
[24:36] he said
[24:39] having made known unto us
[24:42] the mystery of his will
[24:49] according to his good pleasure
[24:52] which has purposed in himself
[25:07] which is not being
[25:10] programmed today
[25:14] was purposed in him
[25:18] he was the foundation of the world
[25:22] so therefore this Faith
[25:26] helps you to touch and understand
[25:39] after reading that scripture brother
[25:42] Branham says the mystery
[25:46] of his way
[25:49] now it's not just a little thing
[25:54] it is a mystery God's will
[25:59] is a mystery and each man has to seek
[26:03] out the will of God
[26:07] for his or herself
[26:11] God's mystery
[26:14] how do we find out foreign
[26:29] [Applause]
[27:16] whatever
[27:20] [Music]
[28:00] foreign
[28:14] [Applause]
[28:36] [Applause]
[28:59] in the mystery of his wife
[29:10] [Applause]
[29:17] you are standing in the path of faith
[29:23] troubles will come but you are anointed
[29:26] to overcome
[29:35] [Applause]
[29:38] amen
[29:41] they literally were taken out of this
[29:43] Dimension by Death
[29:50] [Music]
[29:55] foreign
[30:20] [Applause]
[30:37] foreign
[31:11] gotten to the bank of life
[31:17] but perfect faith
[31:19] will say healing is
[31:22] realize
[31:26] [Music]
[31:30] and sometimes they cut off your legs
[31:33] but healing is that
[31:39] foreign
[32:15] didn't have the faith
[32:40] but the grace
[32:44] going through that
[32:46] was also faith
[32:50] yeah amen amenities
[33:43] foreign
[34:11] foreign
[34:28] so without a true New Birth
[34:31] you can never catch the right direction
[34:34] of faith
[34:38] faith is the revelation of God's perfect
[34:41] week
[34:45] and that's why Faith
[34:48] had a different renderings in Hebrews
[34:51] 11.
[34:55] because God's perfect twins
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:14] God gave him the kind of faith
[35:17] that was good enough but the path that
[35:21] he had given him
[35:23] amen we all have the past work
[35:26] congratulations in this
[35:51] [Applause]
[36:26] in Hebrew
[36:39] that God has chosen foreign
[36:48] [Applause]
[36:55] amen Amina praise God yes sir so my
[37:00] brother I want us to Define this Faith
[37:05] to fully understand this Faith
[37:08] this Faith here
[37:10] is described in Romans chapter 10
[37:16] and verse 17.
[37:20] in this chapter here
[37:24] foreign
[37:54] a man Believers unto righteousness
[37:59] and with the mouth confessions made at
[38:03] Salvation
[38:04] for the scripture says
[38:11] shall not be ashamed for there is no
[38:15] difference
[38:16] between the Jew and the Greek
[38:19] for the same Lord
[38:28] our faith that doesn't discriminate or
[38:32] quick it is
[38:35] [Music]
[38:43] how then shall they call on him
[38:46] in whom they have not believed
[38:52] in you of whom they foreign
[39:42] foreign
[40:11] so unless you have that SIM card okay
[40:15] unless you've got the city
[40:18] unless you've been a part of God
[40:21] before the foundation of the world
[40:32] but the moment you hear I always
[40:37] want you here
[40:40] translates directly
[40:42] [Applause]
[40:44] into the face
[40:46] that the Lord yes
[40:57] foreign
[41:29] so he says when they put the Life of
[41:31] Christ
[41:32] when you have the faith of Jesus Christ
[41:35] then the party of Jesus Christ then the
[41:39] knowledge of Jesus Christ so that at
[41:42] that particular time
[41:43] that Faith a quicker is open brings down
[41:47] the Life of Christ and you can say
[41:52] but Christ that lives
[41:57] and then the prophet says
[42:00] according to that question then the
[42:03] bride we don't know Muslim people
[42:05] represented by Christ no question
[42:08] meaning that the bride together is the
[42:11] Peace of Christ himself
[42:16] which has got the ability to listen to
[42:20] the bright group
[42:23] and then builds the nature of the
[42:25] husband
[42:27] and as it builds the nature of the house
[42:32] among the work is no longer I take a
[42:37] reason but Christine
[42:41] you see what perfect Faith does
[42:43] it doesn't stop on that it can go for
[42:48] your transformation
[42:56] things begin to change
[43:00] are you together with me you totally
[43:03] begin to change and what happens
[43:08] begins to build
[43:10] rupturing Grace
[43:13] in our lives
[43:17] rupturing Grace
[43:19] is in this message
[43:22] are you together
[43:24] yeah you just submit where are you and
[43:28] then
[43:29] and then all of a sudden
[43:32] the stream comes through
[43:39] those who believe me
[43:42] out of them
[43:46] rivers of Living Water
[43:51] [Music]
[44:02] that you are born again
[44:05] you have perfect faith
[44:09] so just submit yourself
[44:12] into the message
[44:14] give yourself time into that message
[44:18] that's what will change
[44:23] it yes sir just subject to yourself
[44:27] where are you amen Amina do you know
[44:29] what Abram did against faith I mean I
[44:33] guess so
[44:34] against hope
[44:37] he believed in Hope yeah are you
[44:40] together with him
[44:42] with a few proposals
[44:45] your face will be true but if it's a
[44:49] revelation against hope you believe in
[44:52] hope that never comes and says
[44:57] because the word is revelation to you
[45:03] are you together with them do you have
[45:06] perfect Faith
[45:08] perfect faith
