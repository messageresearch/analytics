We thank God for this evening. Let us pray. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we want to thank you Lord for the opportunity you've given to us, Father that we can come into your presence. You said where two or three are gathered in your name, we will be there in their Lord. We believe you're here in our medies. We pray that Lord you may speak to us the words of eternal life. So hear our prayers. You may meet our needs Lord. You may encourage us Lord. You may revive us. Lord that you may even heal the sick in our commit all the needs of the children of God into your heart with those who are around and those who are not around. that your grace may meet everyone and bless us together Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and ask this &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. So I request we turn to our Bibles. Praise the name of our Lord. We are going to the book of Luke. Luke Luke chapter 14 from verse let me just pick a few scripts verses here. Luke chapter 14 and then we read in verse 26 Luke 14 26 The Bible says, "If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yeah, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. and soever does not bear his cross and come after me, he cannot be my disciple. May God bless his word. So I want to share on the subject carrying your cross. Praise the name of our Lord. You know our Lord Jesus Christ when he was seated you know, he was seated with the Pharisees. And then when you you can get that background in Luke chapter 14, [Music] Luke 14 and verse one. And it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath day that they watched him. So now he was actually with the Pharisees. And then there were many people who were seated at the feast that the Lord had gone to. And then when he started talking about the words of the kingdom of God, you know, and then people started admiring. And then one of the people who was at that feast in verse 15, the Bible says, "And one of them that sat at meat with him had these things. He said unto him, blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. [Music] You know he said those people are going to eat bread. Those people are going to occupy you know in the kingdom of God. They are blessed. Praise the name of our Lord. Jesus started giving them another parable. And then he said, "A certain man made a great supper and asked many people to come." So he made his supper. And then he sent invitations. Come to my supper. Everything has been said. And then he said when he sent his servant at supper time to call the people said come all things are now ready and then they started giving excuses. One said I have bought a piece of ground. and I need to go and see it. You know, it's a rainy season. You know, I need to plant my seeds. You know, it's a harvest season. I need to see what the price of my goods in the market. You know, it's an a time of, you know, kind of, you know, taking animals to the market. And you know that the natural activities we do, they will continue on until you leave earth. Because that's what the scripture says as it was in the days of Noah. They were buying, they were selling even the day that it rained as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorra. They were building, they were marrying, they were giving in marriage even when Sodom was destroyed. Now you see that we always get preoccupied by our unnatural activities. You know you have program from morning to evening. But now when you look at the time that God requires your time, the duration he requires you. It's not the whole day like the whole of the week. We have only one midweek service on Wednesday from 4:30 up to 7. And then you find it is difficult to allocate that time to God. So even these people had excuses. Oh, I'm too busy. You know, I have monthly reports to make. tomorrow. I have our investors. They have been occupying us today. I have my supervisors are on ground and my supervisor told me that he needs to spend time with me this evening. And God says okay. So they started giving excuses. H you know today it has not been raining the whole week and it rained today morning and last night. [Music] I need to go and finish my garden. You know just leaving to do for you planting is not good enough. Then you ask who made the rains rain? Praise the name of our Lord. Now the one who commanded the rain to rain, he's telling you now give me some time and then you go back to your do your things. This time is precious in my garden. You can wait another time. So the man want was looking at those people. He said blessed are those people who be in the kingdom of God. And then Jesus tells him the price that you need to pay to be in that kingdom is that there are things you have to surrender. There are things you have to deny. There are things you have to fulfate for you to gain the other. But you can't have both of them at the same time. He said you cannot love God. You can only love at the same time. &gt;&gt; You'll either like the m spending all your time even time for service in your place of work because that's love of m because from work you get money. So now the time of God you say huh I need to get more money here at this time that's when the traders are coming people are coming to buy but now you look at some of these don't have even any hope those Muslims in town in Ginger when it comes to around half midday They close. So we are going for prayers and they come back after they not have done what they mean to do. And then for us who know better. We have many excuses you know no it is a lot of time. How about places where they have morning fellowships, morning glory every day, lunch hour every day and then for us we have only one day but becomes difficult for us to come into the services of the Lord. So Jesus said they all begin to give excuse and you know God does not choose idle people. He always chooses busy people. He found Matthew at the customs. He found Peter James and John fishermen. You know they were not there that they were jobless. Now God you can we have time for God. It's not like that. You know there are some people who think that to serve God. I must be when I'm idle. I have nothing else to do. Then I can now have time for God. It does not work like that. Actually, God requires your best, your precious time, you know, your best time, your best energy, you know, your best, your best things, you want so much. Then he says, "Give me that." He wants us to give him the best. So now you see that people gave excuses and we find ourselves caught in the same situation. You know you find that you are saying ah now I need this more time. I need to do this. I need to do this. There's a brother we had here some years ago, maybe 10 plus years, and I I I think we're were raising him to be one of our song leaders and then he was doing senior 4 [Music] around because seniors are in examination time &gt;&gt; and then So there is a Sunday he didn't come to pray. Now I think it took either a month or so I don't remember but then I I met him and I asked him brother what happened that you didn't pray with us on Sunday and you know I was doing I was praying for examinations exams are not on Sunday in government exams are not on Sunday but now he was uptaken there. So the question is supposing God comes supposing he comes in that same season. Praise the name of our Lord. He comes when he's meant to find you here. You in another place. It was very unfortunate that the brother didn't do well in those exams. He had to repeat. very unfortunate. But then the whole thing is how much do you value God in your life? These people had excuses. I have a ground. I'm a farmer. So excuse me. Then he went to another said, "I have bought five oxen. I need to prove them. I already put a lot of money in them. So you excuse me. Then again he went to another. I have just married a wife. I need my honeymoon. And now there are many brothers and sisters who marry [Music] when they have married church. They forget. I don't know what happens. They also forget church. Then they come back. This one was also giving an excuse. I'm just married. The things of God first. Hold on. Same thing here. And then another one. So now the Bible says when they came and told the master Then the master was very angry. Then he said okay. &gt;&gt; You know now you look at the category of people the invitation of was first given. One was a serious farmer. He had enough money to buy a a farm. He was not a poor person there. Then another one had also got five yoke of oxen. That's not small money. Another one had just made a wedding. They were not poor people. And sometimes we think that the people who are educated that one going to receive the gospel or sometimes we think maybe my boss or my manager or my what they are given the invitation. They despise that invitation based on what they possess based on what really they they they own based on their position. Some of these what the Lord does if they are really the elect. What God does is he first make sure that removes some of those things that take their attention away from God. past loses a job say that he's not too busy for God and he become desperate to seek the Lord or some problems at home tried there. They have tried there and then now they start thinking about God or maybe sickness just comes and takes a hold of them. And they have spent a lot. That's when they can now look to God. But then we shouldn't be like those kind of people that I first have the problem come to me to awaken me to think about God. We need to be like David when he was a king. He thought about God in everything he was doing until he said, "I would rather be a data prime minister." But then he wouldn't cheat on the time of prayer. Every morning he made sure he was praying. Every evening made sure he was praying. The position in the kingdom did not take him away from God. Praise the name of our Lord. It also be the same thing with us. If God has blessed you with a job, let your job not take your attention away from God. If God has blessed you with wealth, you know, let them not take you away from God. God has blessed with a good family or whatever earthly possession, let it not take you away from God. Praise the name of our Lord. That song that we sing, nothing between me and my savior, nothing between let you have a clear vision of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Now when the these people the the highend people when they denied the invitation now the servants had to go to those people in those people in homes those who were there taking bangi king. They despised of the community. They said, "Please come." And what is interesting, most of them came. But even when they came, there was still room at the guest. Praise the name of Lord. So now even us when we are witnessing don't despise the person by his appearance but will this one understand the word praise the name of our lord about the goodness of the lord you can't tell that maybe this person who looks to be the worst person may be better than the religious person. The Bible says they came. But then the Bible says that those who were bidden and they didn't come, they shall not taste of my supper. Verse 24. For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. Why? They counted themselves unworthy. And many times it is us who count ourselves unworthy. You despise the call. You despise the assembly of coming together as children of God. You despise reading your message books. You despise testifying about the goodness of the Lord. [Music] You count yourself unworthy. But yet the door is open. Come unto me you are heavy laden. Whosoever will, let come and drink. Praise the name of our Lord. The invitation is given to all but few take it serious. So now this man was admiring those who will be sitting in the kingdom of God. But then to sit in the kingdom of God, you have to count that you know the things of God are more precious than the things that I have. Praise the name of our Lord to know and acknowledge. Praise the name of our Lord. That's what Abraham did. When Abraham got a divine call, then he had to leave the country of his parents. [Music] When you look at Moses, the same thing. He had to despise the position in the government of Pharaoh. The reproach of Christ to be greater riches. Now the Bible has told us if we are going to follow Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we have to deny everything and we have to bear his cross and then follow him. Praise the name of our Lord. You bear the cross of God. You bear the burden of God. And then he said, "My burden is light. Praise the name of the Lord. You carry it and follow me. Take my reproach. Take my my my my kind of humility. That's how the Lord wants us to do is not to carry the cross of Jesus Christ and then you carry it following him. So the Bible says you have to deny yourself. He said you deny your parents, you deny your sisters and brothers. In other words, you put God more important than all these other things. You know the Bible says that the soul that sinnth it shall die because God himself He has created these souls in Ezekiel 18:20. Ezekiel 18:20. The soul that sinnth, it shall die. The soul, the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. for [Music] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him. And who demands the righteousness that is God who has created us. So now he says you have to deny everything you know for the sake of the kingdom of God. Now in the message greater than Solomon is here he says the church needs tonight not a soft hybrid something soft and flabby like a church is. Just make a confession, be baptized, and you are a Christian. &gt;&gt; To be a Christian is self denial. Praise the name of the Lord. Selfden your rights. You know your own decision making. You know like we are living in the the Rodician church age. It's an age of you know rights of the people you know this group right the other group right this group right animal right you know until in Japan they have an animal right I think it is a day and to to demonstrate on that day of animals They walk naked then they have animal they have different rights they put there in Europe they are telling stop eating meat you know they are making things coming up different things coming up all over the children, right? So like in those developed countries, the child can sit on top of a car and then you have to wait for the child until the child comes down. The child is right. You don't say anything against them. You have to beg them. It's the day that we are living in. Right. Right. Right. Right. But as a Christian, &gt;&gt; there is selfdenial. You deny many things that pertain to the comfort of this body. You deny &gt;&gt; at night some time of yours and put be yourself in prayer. You know, you spend some bit of time at night praying, &gt;&gt; waiting on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you deny yourself food. You know, you deny it because you have to wait on the Lord to pray and fast. This Saturday, we having a praying and fasting meeting. But many times we get so busy and then you get the same people who keep on coming are the ones then others that day is not in my program and then even sometimes when we come we come here at midday at one you want to go back then you start wondering how much time have you spent before the Lord? But Christian life is selfdenial. You know, you have to deny many things. You have to deny the fashions of the world. You know, things that are obscene, &gt;&gt; you know, things that are provocative, you know, things that are seductive, you know, you deny them. You have to make judgment yourself what I'm dressing. Is it really worthy? the way I'm talking worthy. You know, there's a lot of selfdenial to be a Christian because some of these things are evil spirits. So, you don't want to be associated with an evil spirit. So then you have to take things with the way God wants us to do them. So he says you deny yourself, you take up your cross, you follow me daily. Today it is so soft and people call themselves Christians when it used to mean death to confess Christ. were and you had to depend on him daily for everything you have need of. Praise the name of our Lord denying yourself and then you take up the cross and then you follow the Lord Jesus Christ life. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message revelation book of symbols he says &gt;&gt; Mr. Pastor Lily &gt;&gt; he is a wonderful school a wonderful Bible teacher Mr. really is. He gets down into the valley, &gt;&gt; dark place, he pushed himself up through the darkness of the earth. [Music] So what to do? To glorify himself to glorify everything that comes in contact with him. And he has to toil day and night to keep his radiance of beauty to keep the perfume flowing. You know now there are those those plants that grow in the swampy areas [Music] &gt;&gt; and then now the roots are in the mud. [Music] But for that plant to come out of that mud, it has to do a lot of struggling. It has to do a lot of struggling. And now when it comes on the surface, then it starts showing its presence. And then it puts on the flower. And that flower, you know, the bees can come and get nectar, different things from there. Perfume can come from there or a nice smell. But then he says it doesn't show itself or to kind of glorify itself. Praise the name of our Lord. So when it it comes out, you look at the top as being so beautiful, but beneath it, there are trials that it go through, frustrations that it go through. That is the life of a Christian. You know that you learn to love your enemy. You know, after God taking you through different situations, you know, because there are things that God permits you to go through like an eagle. Praise the name of our Lord. when it's going to lay its eggs, you know, it makes the nest so comfortable. It puts there, you know, the fur of the rabbits and then it makes it so comfortable. The real praise the name of our Lord. Very comfortable. The chicks come. They are there like mothers. You know they they prepare well for their children who are coming. A new baby show, a new baby what? I don't know what they use nowadays. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; You know those days we did have those things like pumpers. We used to have napkins. Too many of them. So you So now the white life has been made easy. So now they make preparations of that. So well, so now when the the young eagle is just still young, just fed you know the mother keeps them watching over them. But the eagles are not going to live in the nest. So they have they are meant to fly. They are meant to kind of like go against winds, they are meant to hunt to live. Praise the name of our Lord. So even God when we are just coming here on earth, when we are coming into his kingdom, he can make everything very good. You know, you find there is joy, peace. The brother, the people you've got in church are so kind to you. Those kind of things, but it may not be like that forever. Then he starts steering the nest. You have accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior. Everything at work is good. Then now your boss comes. You know the situation is not good. So instead of using 1 million, you're right. We have used 10 millions. But then they start hating you and see how they can dismiss you. and they are chasing you from the place of work because of the truth and you lose your job. Then you start wondering but all these are things to help you to develop the character of Jesus Christ because the Bible says Christ learned obedience by the things that he suffered. So even the ego at a particular time it has to remove everything that he has put there until the the igllets just start feeling the thorns inside is pressing them in the air. And then brother Brham says it's until that those eagles are put in a situation that's when they will learn to depend on the mother because he throws them in the in the air and then when they trying to fall comes and spreads the wings. So God also allows those to come. You don't have no salary. Now you start wondering how am I going to go through this man living by faith. Praise the name of our Lord. You start depending upon God. Children are going to school. No school fees. How are they going to study? You depend on the Lord all your lifetime. He's teaching you to depend upon him like the children of Israel when they were coming out of Egypt or when they were still in Egypt. The Bible says the the the the plagues that were in Egypt was not reaching in Gen. In Egypt they have darkness very thick. But then in go there is light. In Egypt the water is blood. [Music] But then in go the water is okay. In Egypt frogs are all over everything. But go was protected. That is our God. That is our God rejoicing. The Bible say a mixed multitude. Everybody was rejoicing. They went through the Red Sea. They were all rejoicing after crossing. Ah, God is great. God is good. And then they started entering the wilderness. No food, no water, mixed multitude. to try them and that's why you need to bear the cross. &gt;&gt; You don't come to Christ because of benefit but you come to him say Lord where he leads me I will follow. Praise the name of our Lord. You are not afraid. Whatever comes, praise the name of the Lord because the Lord is with me. And that's what the Lord teaches us. That's what the mother eagle teaches the igl to teach it until it can also go and start hunting. Praise the name of our Lord. So even the le of the valley it does not live for itself. Then he says he's pulled day and night from the earth to give out. That's what a real Christian does. You pray and humble yourself and keep before God day and night. in order you might give yourself to somebody else. Not what you keep. It is what you give out that counts. You must give yourself to others. That's what Jesus did. He gave himself to others. Praise the name of our Lord. So now we need to see that we do the best we can for the kingdom of God. Put God first. Let God rule over all your things. And that means you have to deny yourself. You have to deny your rights and then see what does the Lord want me to do in this situation. Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe colleagues at your place of work, you have end of year party and everybody is dressing the way they want. How about you? What are you going to do? Oh, your fellow students. You know, everybody wants to identify themselves as I'm coming from this district, from this tribe, I'm coming from this school. We are now going to have a welcome party. What are you going to do or leave us party? There are things you have to deny yourself to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the message Elijah and the meal offering he said and she said there it was the greatest consolation that any believer ever listened to. For thus says the Lord. That's the word she was waiting for. Thus says the Lord. The barrel will not go empty, neither will the cruise go dry until the day that God sends rain on the earth. What do we get there? Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. How do I know? Brother, how do I know? The only thing I know. Put God first and move on. Sacrifice. Mix the oil. The word and the spirit together. No more. Lay yourself upon the cross and say here I am Lord. Put God first in everything. Praise the name of our Lord. That should be our Christian life. The day that you leave, you have surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ. And then your testimony is must Jesus bear the cross alone. You have to bear. Praise the name of the Lord. You know the Bible says we also suffer for his cause. And then he said he will give us everything 100% but with suffering denying yourself carrying his cross. They are not pleasant things. But then it is the way that the Lord has purposed to mold our character like a mother giving birth. There is a pain that comes. Praise the name of our Lord. But at the end of the day, there is joy. Praise the name of our Lord. Joy that I've given birth. Joy that I have a child. Praise the name of our Lord. He allows us to go through different situations, bear his name, carry the cross, and deny ourselves. Praise the name of our Lord. All this we do, we're not doing them in vain. Praise the name of our Lord. He comes and gives us the grace to go through them. Praise the name of our Lord. So the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Praise the name of our Lord." In Galatians 6:14, as I try to finish, he says, "But God forbide that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. So you crucify yourself and then say, "Lord, the things of the world are passed, but I Put the things of God first. Praise the name of our Lord. Give God your best place. All your life, you give it to the Lord. All that you possess, you give it to the Lord. Lord, everything that I have, my life is in your hands. My possessions are in your hands. My family is in your hands. And then Jesus has told us, "Praise the name of our Lord." Let us go back to Luke where we read. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 14. Luke chapter 14. And then let us read in verse 626. &gt;&gt; If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and his wife and children and brethren and his sisters, yeah, his own life also, he cannot be my disciples. [Music] So there is a selfdenial in Mark chapter 10 and then verse 37 &gt;&gt; he says He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worth of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worth of me. And he that taketh not his cross and follows after me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it. And he that loses his life shall find it. Praise the name of our Lord. God wants us to sacrifice whatever we have your life, your family, your resources and then put them to the forefront of God and say, "Lord, I'm giving you all these things." And when you give them to him, it's like you're losing them, but then you are gaining them at the end of the day. But then you don't give him then you lose. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to carry the cross and follow Jesus Christ. You deny yourself. You take on the word of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. He said, "My yoke is easy, so come unto me and you'll find rest for your souls. My yoke is easy and my burden is light." So every day let us carry our cross and follow the Lord Jesus Christ denying yourself your rights your privileges and say Lord I'm just coming before you in the name of our Lord. May God bless you. Amen. Let us sing that song as we each of us go to pray. Must Jesus bear the cross. Amen. There is a cross for me. There is a cross for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Song 89. &gt;&gt; Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free. [Music] Lord, there is a cross for everyone and there is a cross for me. The ghosted cross till death shall set me free. And then go home my crown to well for there is a ground for me. [Music] Upon the green stop down at Jesus fe [Music] with joy out my God and crown and peace at every [Applause] [Music] Oh precious cross, all glorious crown, glory. [Music] [Applause] The angels grow, the stars come down and my soul away. Now let us sing. Where he leads me, I'll follow. Amen. I can hear my Savior calling. I can hear my savior [Music] calling.

I will follow. [Music] I'll go with him all the way. You can now speak to the Lord. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, how we thank you, Father, for your love, grace, and mercy. Lord, you've been so gracious unto us, Father. You've been so merciful unto us, Lord. And we worship you, Lord. We adore you, heavenly father. And our confession tonight, Lord Jesus, is wherever you lead us, Lord, we want to follow, Lord, through different situations, Lord. And how you said some through the waters and some through the fine and some through the floods, but you are still the same, God, that you make us go through the blood. It's by going through the blood that we even have life and life eternal. We have strength, Lord, and abilities, heavenly father, to overcome every circumstance that we go through in life. How we worship you, heavenly father. How we glorify thy name. Help us in the name of Jesus Christ to deny ourselves Lord. Oh God, you said that we need to deny oh God our families, how we need to deny our lives that we can be following you. And you say if we can't deny all those things, we are not worthy Lord. In other words, we cannot make it Lord, we cannot overcome the temptations before us. We cannot overcome the challenges before us if we don't deny everything and follow you Lord. We pray may give us the grace heavenly father not to debate it oh God but Lord to take the challenge right way father that we may deny everything for the sake of the cross of Jesus Christ and how the Bible told us I've crucified everything the whole world and everything that I may gain Christ help us in the name of Jesus Christ and how Paul had to put all his knowledge to be done that he may gain in Christ. He had to put his knowledge aside. He had to put his family background aside. He had to put his influence aside that he may be able to gain Christ and just became completely nothing. Oh God, we pray may help us heavenly. Father, that Lord, we may be into the hands of the porter to mold us, to make us, oh God. Father, we know when we're in your hands, you'll mold us to be vessels of God alone. vessels, oh God, where you will come and dwell in us, oh God, where you will come, heavenly father, and reveal yourself to us, where you come, heavenly father, and show us the path we have to take. Forgive us of all our sins and trespasses, Lord. Forgive us of all our failures, Lord. Help us to overcome, oh God, all our weaknesses, heavenly father, that Lord, we may live the life of Jesus Christ, waiting on you, Lord, depending upon you, Lord, glorifying and magnifying today.

All that we are, Lord, we lift them all unto you. May your divine will and purpose come down to encourage us, to strengthen us, to lead us, Lord, even all along the way, and to help us to overcome all our weaknesses.
