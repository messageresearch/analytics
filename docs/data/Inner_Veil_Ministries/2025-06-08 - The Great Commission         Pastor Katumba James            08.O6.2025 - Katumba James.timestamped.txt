[28:27] you God bless you saints
[28:34] um our pastor is not here
[28:39] Like pastor James has said,
[28:42] he's been
[28:44] weak and um the weakness has been uh he
[28:49] says it has been there through the past,
[28:51] you know,
[28:55] years. It has been coming and going and
[28:57] is
[29:00] managed. Yeah. But uh recently when he
[29:03] came from Canada,
[29:06] I remember he spent like six weeks away
[29:10] He carried out so many
[29:12] services. Then when he came back
[29:16] uh we had a handover
[29:20] service. Then through the week he was
[29:23] invited to different
[29:26] churches. Then he had to travel again to
[29:31] Tanzania. So that make made him a little
[29:34] bit deeply actually fatigued.
[29:40] and it greatly affected his
[29:43] health. As you
[29:45] know, he has been telling that he has
[29:48] been managing diabets and
[29:54] hypertension. Depression. Yeah. So
[29:58] together with the
[30:00] fatigue Yeah. It made him so weak that I
[30:03] could not even walk.
[30:07] Yeah, he could just he could not make
[30:10] two
[30:11] steps. He could make one step and then
[30:14] falls
[30:15] down. Uh speaking was very very
[30:20] slow. Speaking
[30:23] speaking. Yeah. Sometimes would fail
[30:25] even to speak a word.
[30:30] Yeah. But um you know with also the
[30:33] effect of the toll of the ministry
[30:40] at all burden
[30:43] you
[30:44] traveling and then a few illnesses here
[30:47] and
[30:48] there. Maybe you're not eating well on
[30:51] those travels, you're not eating
[30:54] well. So, it really uh put a toll on his
[30:58] on his
[31:00] health. So the last week
[31:04] uh we've been managing
[31:06] him. We've been managing his
[31:09] condition and he has been receiving
[31:12] treatment at
[31:15] home. Yeah. And now he's in a better
[31:20] position. Yes. He can walk around. He
[31:23] can walk
[31:25] around. He can even hold a conversation.
[31:30] So we just we just continue
[31:33] praying that uh his
[31:36] healing is
[31:39] hastened and also we pray for the
[31:42] strength in his
[31:44] spirit so that he can come and be
[31:46] amongst
[31:48] us. So we just pray that uh as a family
[31:52] and as
[31:54] church. Yes. Let us um rally around him
[31:58] in in this time. Let us rally around him
[32:01] in this time.
[32:07] Yeah. And we lift him in
[32:09] prayer. You can reach out with
[32:13] love. Honor his many many faithful years
[32:16] in
[32:18] service. You can give him a
[32:21] call. It means a lot when he's hearing
[32:24] from you.
[32:27] and I believe that God is hand upon
[32:31] him and of course the unit of the
[32:34] church as we pray
[32:36] together. He will return to full
[32:39] strength and then you'll be able to
[32:41] stand with us
[32:43] here. Amen. Amen. Yeah. So that is what
[32:46] is happening with our precious
[32:49] pastor. That is
[32:51] okay. Is very okay now. Yeah. May God
[32:55] bless you.

[45:07] done. Well, I've got so much to thank
[45:12] him for, so much to praise him for. You
[45:18] see, he has been so good to me.
[45:25] When I
[45:27] think of all he's done and
[45:31] when he brought me from my God so much
[45:36] to
[45:38] thank him
[45:41] for and
[45:44] sometimes along the way I need you. I
[45:50] stop and say thank you for all you've
[45:55] done for
[45:58] me. And one
[46:01] day a re sweet heaven
[46:05] show. Oh, please let me kneel and say
[46:10] thank you. Thank you.
[46:14] Oh yeah. Well, I've gone so much to
[46:19] thank him for so much to praise him for
[46:25] you. See, he has been so good to me.
[46:33] When I
[46:35] think of what he's done and
[46:39] when he brought me from my God's soul to
[46:45] thank him
[46:49] for. Well, I've got so much to thank him
[46:55] for. So much to praise him for.
[47:00] You see, you mean so good to
[47:06] me. And when I
[47:09] think of all he's done for
[47:13] me and his
[47:16] [Music]
[47:23] bron. Amen.
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:30] Praise the name of our Lord. Yesterday I
[47:32] was a
[47:34] birthday kind of their home for the
[47:36] little
[47:40] baby and we thank God for
[47:43] that. Praise the name of our Lord.
[47:47] Unfortunately, we don't have our
[47:50] projector, but there's a song in I
[47:52] wanted to
[47:54] sing, but I believe we shall skip that.
[47:58] Let us stand
[48:02] up. Let us pray again. Father, we thank
[48:06] you for this
[48:08] morning. The grace that you've given up
[48:10] us,
[48:11] Father, and the things that you do in
[48:13] our
[48:14] midst, we give praise to you, Lord.
[48:18] We pray that as we go to the opening of
[48:20] the
[48:21] word, the spirit of God come and speak
[48:23] to us.
[48:25] Father, may the word become alive in our
[48:29] lives that we may be able to heed what
[48:31] the word tells us to
[48:33] do. Bless us all together, Father, in
[48:37] the name of the Lord Jesus, who
[48:39] uses. Amen. Amen. So, we go to Mark
[48:42] chapter 16.
[48:46] We're reading from verse 15 to verse
[48:53] 20. Mark chapter
[48:55] 16. Verse 15 to verse
[48:59] 20. We want to talk on the great
[49:02] commission.
[49:08] And he said unto them, "Go into all the
[49:11] world and preach the gospel to every
[49:20] creature." He that believeth and is
[49:23] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[49:25] believeth not shall be damned.
[49:34] And these signs shall follow them that
[49:37] believe in my name. They shall cast out
[49:39] devils. They shall speak with new
[49:51] tongues. They shall take up serpents,
[49:54] and if they drink any deadly thing, it
[49:56] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[49:59] hands on the sick and they shall
[50:17] recover. spoken to unto them. He was
[50:20] received up in heaven and sat on the
[50:22] right hand of
[50:32] God. And they went forth and preached
[50:35] everywhere, the Lord working with them
[50:38] and confirming the word with signs
[50:41] following. Amen.
[51:01] Amen. May God bless his
[51:05] worded. So one share on the great
[51:10] commission. Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:13] So when the Lord Jesus was leaving the
[51:16] earth, he told his
[51:20] disciples, "Go out into all the
[51:25] world and preach the gospel to every
[51:30] creature. Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:33] Every
[51:34] creature has to hear the
[51:38] gospel." Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:41] And you know to hear that
[51:43] gospel it is all our
[51:47] responsibility to make sure that every
[51:49] creature hears the
[51:52] gospel. You may not be a
[51:55] minister. But you can also talk about
[51:59] Christ. You can testify about
[52:03] Christ to at your place of work, at your
[52:07] home, at your neighborhood.
[52:11] Maybe the man you always sent to buy for
[52:13] you
[52:15] food or the man you sent to pick your
[52:18] children or take your
[52:21] children. You can have a conversation on
[52:24] the Lord Jesus
[52:27] Christ. Tell them the goodness of the
[52:30] Lord. Tell them of what the Lord has
[52:33] done in your
[52:34] life. You give a
[52:37] testimony. Tell them how you got saved.
[52:41] And you see even St.
[52:43] Paul whenever he had an opportunity to
[52:46] go to the
[52:48] Jews be among the
[52:51] congregation. He would talk about his
[52:55] background and he said you know I was so
[52:58] zealous. I was
[53:01] a persecuting the
[53:03] church and then he would talk about the
[53:06] his conversion.
[53:09] I was going from, you know, he was going
[53:11] to
[53:12] Damascus with soldiers of the
[53:15] temple. And then a bright shining light
[53:18] shone before
[53:20] him. And then a voice spoke to him in
[53:22] the Hebrew
[53:24] language. Saul, why do you
[53:28] persecute? And then he said, who are
[53:30] you,
[53:31] Lord? Then he said, I'm Jesus.
[53:34] You find Paul testifying about his
[53:37] conversion several
[53:40] times and they would get new people and
[53:42] then tell them about the
[53:45] Lord sent him to go and preach the
[53:49] gospel.
[53:50] Even every one of us has got a testimony
[53:53] of what the Lord has
[53:55] done. You can't say me I don't know what
[53:58] the Lord has done for
[53:59] you. You have something to
[54:02] testify. Maybe when you were too
[54:05] sick and then you felt you couldn't go
[54:08] any
[54:09] further, you can testify to another
[54:13] person. The other day I was almost
[54:16] dying and the Lord came down and
[54:19] delivered you
[54:21] testifying. Praise the name of our Lord.
[54:23] as you are
[54:25] testifying hearing the good news of the
[54:27] gospel of Jesus
[54:30] Christ and then they can also tell you
[54:32] about their
[54:34] problems this and this we have at
[54:37] home you think can work
[54:39] out can do
[54:42] it the name of each of us has a
[54:46] testimony testifying to your
[54:49] friends testifying to your colleagues
[54:53] testifying to your
[54:54] neighbors, testifying to your family
[54:57] members, tell them about what the Lord
[55:00] has done in your
[55:01] life, why you got
[55:04] saved. Tell them the goodness of the
[55:07] Lord. Each and every one of us has a
[55:12] responsibility to bring souls to
[55:15] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord.
[55:17] It's only the minister's responsibility.
[55:22] Each and every one of
[55:25] us we have a
[55:28] responsibility to bring a soul or two or
[55:31] three to the Lord
[55:34] Jesus. We ask
[55:36] ourselves how many people have I brought
[55:39] the Lord
[55:41] Jesus in the message of blushing
[55:46] prophet. So he says, I know I know God's
[55:50] program. It is written out here in the
[55:54] Bible and I'm ashamed of myself as a
[55:57] minister of the
[56:00] gospel. One million souls
[56:07] won. Okay.
[56:14] I ought to have 10 million souls warned.
[56:22] I'm way behind.
[56:24] Then he says, "What about
[56:28] you?" Praise the name of our Lord. When
[56:30] we start asking
[56:32] ourselves like when we sit here in
[56:35] church in the church members who are
[56:37] here
[56:43] Can you point out and say that this one
[56:44] I'm the one who brought this one to
[56:46] Christ? I think we can look
[56:50] around. How many of us who are here?
[56:55] Can you
[56:58] say that one? I'm the one who testified.
[57:03] I'm the one who told him the gospel. How
[57:05] about us?
[57:07] Then he says, "How many
[57:12] souls you won since you've been in
[57:17] Christ?" Ask yourself, how many have you
[57:20] won since you accepted the
[57:23] Lord? Oh, you only count your
[57:29] family. Oh, you know, produce many
[57:32] children so that I
[57:34] bring churches.
[57:39] You know there was a reverend who was
[57:41] asking pastor sometime I think it was at
[57:42] a
[57:45] funeral and then he was asking him you
[57:49] where do you get your
[57:52] people then he was telling him ours you
[57:56] know
[57:57] produce they bring them in the church
[58:01] and then we baptize them. Now this man
[58:03] was so
[58:06] thinking that the kingdom of
[58:08] God is populated by the natural
[58:13] birth and that's not it. That's what the
[58:16] dominations
[58:18] do and that's what you know the Muslims
[58:20] also
[58:23] preach many produce many I think it was
[58:26] yesterday the other day I was looking at
[58:28] the population of
[58:31] religions and then you know you know I
[58:34] think Christian is the
[58:37] biggest billions of people either two or
[58:40] three
[58:41] billions then followed by
[58:43] Muslims and I think the other was Hindu
[58:46] or something like
[58:49] that. But you know they keep on
[58:51] producing and they think that they
[58:52] gaining
[58:55] more but in the kingdom of
[58:58] God is not a natural
[59:03] [Music]
[59:06] multiplication that you have produced in
[59:08] the flesh and you have added to the
[59:09] kingdom in the kingdom of
[59:11] God is being born again.
[59:15] Praise the name of our Lord. And as long
[59:17] as you've been born
[59:19] again, you have the
[59:21] ability to bring another person into the
[59:24] kingdom of
[59:26] God. How do you do
[59:29] that? Testify of what the Lord has done
[59:32] to
[59:33] you. Don't keep
[59:35] quiet. Talk to that friend of
[59:37] yours. Talk to that stranger.
[59:41] Sometimes at the place of work, people
[59:44] are are talking ill against the
[59:48] gospel. Talk to them about the goodness
[59:50] of the
[59:51] Lord. Tell them there is the
[59:54] truth in that
[59:56] truth. Praise the name of the Lord.
[59:59] Testify about the
[1:00:01] Lord. Your neighbors are there, but they
[1:00:04] don't know what you even believe.
[1:00:08] Now for you, how do you want to go to
[1:00:09] heaven
[1:00:12] alone? When your neighbors are
[1:00:15] there, they even don't know what you
[1:00:17] stand
[1:00:18] for. They don't know even where the
[1:00:20] church you pray from
[1:00:22] is you've never invited
[1:00:25] them. Come and we pray. Some of us have
[1:00:29] relatives at
[1:00:30] home, but we leave them at home. Let me
[1:00:34] go pray. you keep at
[1:00:37] home
[1:00:38] alone, why don't you tell your
[1:00:41] relatives come to your home today is
[1:00:45] Sunday. Let us all go to
[1:00:48] church. Then there are those friends of
[1:00:51] yours who like coming to converse with
[1:00:54] you every
[1:00:55] morning. Remind them that on Sunday I
[1:00:57] want to go with you to church.
[1:01:01] come and hear about the goodness of the
[1:01:03] Lord. See that you invite another
[1:01:08] person to hear the gospel of Jesus
[1:01:11] Christ. So he says, "How many have you
[1:01:14] won since you came into
[1:01:17] Christ?"
[1:01:19] Christianity just goes from one to
[1:01:24] another. That's how we hear the gospel.
[1:01:28] Somebody told you that's why you are
[1:01:31] here. You also need to tell
[1:01:35] somebody testify to them and don't
[1:01:38] despise
[1:01:42] somebody that
[1:01:44] listen and pray for that
[1:01:52] person. They don't listen whatever you
[1:01:54] say. take interest and speak to
[1:01:58] them. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[1:02:01] says Christianity goes from one to
[1:02:04] another. How many souls have you won
[1:02:07] since you became a
[1:02:10] Christian? If you are not winning
[1:02:13] souls, you are
[1:02:16] guilty. You are
[1:02:18] barren. You have brought a shame on the
[1:02:22] church and the gospel.
[1:02:26] How many people are you got out on
[1:02:28] Wednesday night prayer
[1:02:32] meeting? If you are not doing
[1:02:35] it, you ought to be ashamed of
[1:02:39] yourself before
[1:02:41] Christ. You are guilty and your place is
[1:02:45] at the
[1:02:47] altar. In other words, to
[1:02:50] repent. You are not doing what the great
[1:02:53] commission
[1:02:55] says. Testify to another person. Tell
[1:02:59] somebody about Christ. Tell them about
[1:03:02] the goodness of
[1:03:03] Christ. Praise the name of not just that
[1:03:07] is my
[1:03:09] church. We believe the
[1:03:11] message. How will the others hear about
[1:03:14] it if you don't tell them? the people
[1:03:18] you work
[1:03:19] with, have you testified them about the
[1:03:22] goodness of the
[1:03:23] Lord? Praise the name of like now if
[1:03:27] maybe you are in some kind of place like
[1:03:29] maybe in a construction
[1:03:33] site. You know like our brother
[1:03:36] Moses, how many of the people you work
[1:03:40] with have you talked them about
[1:03:43] Christ? Come and come
[1:03:46] and come and worship with
[1:03:49] us. How many have you brought
[1:03:52] into brother at your
[1:03:55] garage? How many people have you told
[1:03:57] please
[1:03:59] come
[1:04:01] with the name of
[1:04:04] brother when you are riding your
[1:04:08] motorcycle the people are you only
[1:04:11] interested in their money or their
[1:04:12] souls?
[1:04:15] Talk to them. There is God who
[1:04:17] saves. There is God who is
[1:04:20] alive. Come and be
[1:04:22] saved. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:04:25] know, you don't
[1:04:31] say what people have you about the Lord
[1:04:35] Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ. Praise the name of God. Like
[1:04:42] sister in your
[1:04:44] shop, they come and buy this.
[1:04:50] How many of you told that Jesus saves?
[1:04:53] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:04:56] the other day, Sister Miriam was very
[1:04:59] sick. Sister Miam.
[1:05:03] So when we went to the
[1:05:04] hospital then she said pray for me that
[1:05:08] I can come back I serve God said that is
[1:05:13] a very good
[1:05:14] one but now in your shop there in
[1:05:18] town people come and buy clothes from
[1:05:22] you. How many have you told about the
[1:05:24] Lord
[1:05:27] Jesus? Praise the name of how many have
[1:05:30] you talked to about the Lord Jesus?
[1:05:34] that he saves. He gives eternal life. He
[1:05:39] has healed me. I was almost
[1:05:42] dying. But now I'm
[1:05:44] okay. How many? Our sister Maria when
[1:05:47] she's in
[1:05:49] school teaching
[1:05:52] entrepreneurship to make money to start
[1:05:57] enterprising. How about the
[1:06:00] gospel? Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:06:03] know, we need to ask
[1:06:04] ourselves, what have I
[1:06:07] done, the place that I'm staying
[1:06:10] in? Praise the name of our Lord. How
[1:06:13] many people have heard about the Lord
[1:06:15] Jesus
[1:06:17] Christ? People like coming to you to
[1:06:19] consult
[1:06:21] you. You a
[1:06:23] consultant. If that person talks to you,
[1:06:27] it is good about the things of the
[1:06:29] gospel.
[1:06:34] So that things of the gospel don't
[1:06:35] matter. The Bible says every
[1:06:38] creature and
[1:06:41] everywhere praise the name of our Lord
[1:06:45] testify. Of course you may not say that
[1:06:47] I'm going to take one whole hour to
[1:06:50] testify what the Lord has done for
[1:06:53] you. The Lord has saved
[1:06:56] you. Initiate interest in the heart of
[1:06:58] that person.
[1:07:02] What have you say? I'll come and hear
[1:07:05] another
[1:07:06] time. Say, but you know there's a person
[1:07:08] who is sick
[1:07:09] here. Can you pray for that person? The
[1:07:13] Bible says they that believe shall lay
[1:07:17] hands on the sick and they shall be
[1:07:19] healed. You can also pray for that
[1:07:22] person.
[1:07:25] There was a prayer line brother Brandham
[1:07:26] was
[1:07:28] having and then there was a sister who
[1:07:30] was seated and saw an a mother carrying
[1:07:32] a baby was very
[1:07:36] sick. So she felt in her heart, God
[1:07:40] Lord, I wish you can heal this child.
[1:07:42] And then she was moved in her
[1:07:44] heart. I went to the mother said, I'm
[1:07:48] sorry. Can you help me with your kid? I
[1:07:50] pray for the
[1:07:52] kid. No, I'm sorry. You continue in the
[1:07:55] prayer line, brother will pray for
[1:07:57] you. And then the mother gave her the
[1:08:00] baby. She prayed for the baby and they
[1:08:03] continued the prayer line. Now when
[1:08:06] brother Brham was discerning
[1:08:08] that he said you your child has been
[1:08:11] healed when the other woman prayed for
[1:08:14] that
[1:08:15] child the child was healed. So the Bible
[1:08:19] says they that
[1:08:21] believe shall lay hands on the
[1:08:25] sick and they shall be healed. As a
[1:08:28] mother you can do that to your children
[1:08:31] lay hands on
[1:08:32] your sick and they recover.
[1:08:35] Maybe you are in the
[1:08:37] neighborhood another woman the child is
[1:08:39] very
[1:08:41] sick. You can tell them God can heal
[1:08:43] your
[1:08:44] child. Put your hand on the child and he
[1:08:46] has
[1:08:47] healed and you can start testifying
[1:08:51] about. Then you find that mother saying
[1:08:54] I want to come to your
[1:08:56] child get saved. Praise the name of our
[1:08:59] Lord. I want to be converted.
[1:09:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:09:04] to the book of first Peter chapter
[1:09:08] 3. Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:09:12] verse
[1:09:16] one, the Bible says, "Likewise, you
[1:09:19] wives be in subjection to your own
[1:09:22] husbands, that if any obey not the word,
[1:09:26] they also may without the word be warned
[1:09:29] by the conversation of the wives.
[1:09:49] while they behold your chest
[1:09:51] conversation coupled with fear.
[1:09:59] Now he says now like you are a
[1:10:03] wife your husband doesn't accept the
[1:10:07] Lord. You have testified to me he
[1:10:09] doesn't believe
[1:10:11] that but he said he can be warned by
[1:10:14] your
[1:10:17] conduct. He sees your conduct
[1:10:20] is say let me go and pray today with my
[1:10:23] wife. That's also how you can win your
[1:10:26] colleagues at place of
[1:10:28] God. That's how you can win your
[1:10:32] neighbors by your true Christian
[1:10:36] conduct when people are ganging up
[1:10:39] together and maybe they are fighting.
[1:10:43] You are a peacemaker.
[1:10:46] You are not putting in fire in this one
[1:10:48] here or siding with this one
[1:10:51] here and then to fight another one here.
[1:10:55] You find you are a very sober
[1:10:57] person that in that
[1:11:00] neighborhood everybody will come and
[1:11:02] consult
[1:11:03] you. You know this is what my husband
[1:11:06] did last
[1:11:07] night. You are not the one to cause them
[1:11:09] to
[1:11:10] split but you give them counsel.
[1:11:15] guidance. Praise the name of Lord. They
[1:11:18] see there's something different in your
[1:11:20] life and then you see how you can bring
[1:11:22] them to
[1:11:23] Christ by the way you behave, by the way
[1:11:27] you talk and the way they see how you
[1:11:30] handle your
[1:11:31] things. Praise the name of our draw men
[1:11:34] to
[1:11:35] Christ. The Bible says when Christ is
[1:11:39] lifted
[1:11:40] up men unto himself.
[1:11:44] You lift Christ by your
[1:11:47] conduct. You lift Christ by your
[1:11:50] testimony. Say, I want to hear more of
[1:11:53] this. I want to go where you
[1:11:56] fellowship. Praise the name of like if
[1:11:59] now you are a
[1:12:02] boss. You know people are working for
[1:12:05] you. Be sincere and pay them the money
[1:12:08] that is due to them.
[1:12:12] exposing
[1:12:13] trust until they would believe every
[1:12:16] word you
[1:12:17] say. But now if they don't believe what
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:21] say, there's something wrong with your
[1:12:25] life. That one is a
[1:12:27] liar. He's just dodging. That's what the
[1:12:30] people do in the world. But now for you
[1:12:33] who is in
[1:12:34] Christ, the Bible says your yes must be
[1:12:38] yes.
[1:12:40] Your no must be
[1:12:42] no. You know, in other words, stand by
[1:12:46] what you
[1:12:48] speak. Let somebody trust in
[1:12:51] you. Praise the name of God. Not being
[1:12:54] double
[1:12:55] tonged. Today you are saying this.
[1:12:58] You're saying another
[1:13:00] thing. It didn't
[1:13:05] work. That one is like that. He has
[1:13:08] finished. should be like
[1:13:10] that where we work, where we study from
[1:13:14] or where we live. Praise the name of So
[1:13:18] the Bible says that the conduct of
[1:13:22] wives can convert their
[1:13:27] husbands. Their husbands can be
[1:13:30] converted. They can be brought to
[1:13:33] Christ by the good conduct of their
[1:13:36] wives.
[1:13:39] Praise the name of Lord. We need to see
[1:13:41] that we win souls to
[1:13:44] Christ. And how do you win souls to
[1:13:47] Christ? By testifying about Christ, by
[1:13:51] living a right life
[1:13:53] about praise the name of God. When you
[1:13:56] among your
[1:13:57] friends or your
[1:13:59] colleagues or where you work or where
[1:14:03] you stay or among your
[1:14:06] relatives, let them see a different
[1:14:09] person who is truly
[1:14:12] converted. And if they are going to say
[1:14:14] there is a
[1:14:16] Christian, I see that person is a true
[1:14:19] Christian. You know nowadays people are
[1:14:21] used to fake people.
[1:14:32] Fake fake
[1:14:35] Christians, fake
[1:14:37] everybody,
[1:14:39] fake. They just used to that because
[1:14:42] that's the end of the
[1:14:44] day. But you are called to be
[1:14:47] different. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:14:50] If you are going to work, be faithful at
[1:14:53] your
[1:14:54] place. Praise the name of our Lord. Be
[1:14:57] sincere. Let the truth be living in
[1:15:01] you, not pretending like the rest of the
[1:15:05] world. Praise the name of Lord. And
[1:15:07] that's how we can bring many souls to
[1:15:11] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:15:14] Now he says in the message
[1:15:17] adoption says until that
[1:15:20] time God let me stay on the
[1:15:25] field
[1:15:28] royal let me I don't care what the cost
[1:15:33] is how many or what I
[1:15:37] do this or that or the other let me stay
[1:15:42] royal and true to the Word of the
[1:15:46] living that when that day
[1:15:49] come and I cross over
[1:15:52] there that I may look
[1:15:55] across and say there you are. Oh my
[1:16:00] precious friend, my precious
[1:16:03] brother, my precious
[1:16:05] sister. now is
[1:16:08] looking you know at the end of the day
[1:16:11] there is time to give
[1:16:14] accountability. How are you going to
[1:16:16] account for your
[1:16:18] time? How are you going to account for
[1:16:20] your
[1:16:21] money? How are you going to account for
[1:16:24] your
[1:16:24] family? How going to account for the
[1:16:28] opportunities that God has given
[1:16:31] you? Praise the name of Do you take time
[1:16:34] in the things of the kingdom of God?
[1:16:37] You know the Bible says that those that
[1:16:40] convert
[1:16:43] many praise the name of our Lord they
[1:16:47] shall shine like
[1:16:50] stars. Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:16:53] us go to the book of Daniel chapter
[1:16:56] 12. And then in
[1:16:59] verse three,
[1:17:03] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:17:05] brightness of the firmament, and they
[1:17:08] that turn many to righteousness, as the
[1:17:11] stars forever and ever.
[1:17:30] they that turn many to
[1:17:36] righteousness. Find out how many men are
[1:17:38] in your
[1:17:40] crown. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:17:43] know like in the
[1:17:45] forces police army or
[1:17:49] prison
[1:17:52] stars for
[1:17:55] general how many stars are
[1:17:58] you? Ask
[1:18:00] yourself on earth they stop that four or
[1:18:03] five
[1:18:05] stars. But for you, every soul you
[1:18:08] win is a star. A star is a star. A star.
[1:18:14] How many stars are you?
[1:18:20] What you've brought into the kingdom of
[1:18:22] God now? These people, the stars are
[1:18:25] just
[1:18:31] here. They can even retire
[1:18:35] you when no one even cares about you. I
[1:18:37] know what they do
[1:18:39] nowadays. Even when they have
[1:18:41] retired, they get those red stars, they
[1:18:46] get a
[1:18:47] metal and then the world red stars
[1:18:50] there and they put in front of their
[1:18:53] car. Then you ah that's a fourstar
[1:18:56] general. Oh, that's one star
[1:19:00] brigade. General two
[1:19:03] stars general maybe three stars. This is
[1:19:06] a general four
[1:19:08] stars. But they stop here. But ours is
[1:19:13] eternity. How many have you got in the
[1:19:17] kingdom? Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:19:20] How many have you brought to Christ?
[1:19:23] Brother Brandham is saying I want to see
[1:19:27] at that
[1:19:28] day oh brother if you didn't
[1:19:32] come if you didn't come if you didn't
[1:19:34] talk about Christ that
[1:19:37] day if you don't come to this place I
[1:19:41] wouldn't have known
[1:19:43] Christ what testimony are you going to
[1:19:46] give praise the name of the Lord but
[1:19:49] then you are
[1:19:51] shy when you are When you're in your
[1:19:54] groups of
[1:19:55] work, you're all about calculations or
[1:20:01] equations. Then you know how to send
[1:20:04] this story to
[1:20:07] everybody status. You put some of those
[1:20:09] things
[1:20:11] there. Things of God are far away.
[1:20:16] Even when they when you're in a meeting
[1:20:18] at your place of
[1:20:20] work, nobody knows that you can
[1:20:25] pray. You just hiding
[1:20:30] yourself today. We have no one who is
[1:20:32] going to pray for us. Put your head
[1:20:35] down. How you going to talk about
[1:20:39] Christ? Because they don't know anything
[1:20:42] about
[1:20:43] you. But if they know you as a person
[1:20:46] who loves
[1:20:47] God, they even call you pastor when
[1:20:50] you're not a
[1:20:55] person. Let them pray for us. But in
[1:20:58] that place, nobody knows about
[1:21:02] you. What they know are which
[1:21:06] doctors, nobody knows about you.
[1:21:13] That one who who moved from there was a
[1:21:16] Christian. Can you
[1:21:20] imagine? You are a
[1:21:23] Christian, a saved
[1:21:27] person and a witch doctor moves you from
[1:21:31] the
[1:21:35] village. Where is your power? The demon
[1:21:38] is in that place. So let me move away.
[1:21:43] But there are people like
[1:21:45] that that at their place of
[1:21:48] work they are put
[1:21:51] down until people will come and speak
[1:21:56] vulgar language in your office
[1:22:00] when you laugh and feed on that there is
[1:22:03] something wrong with
[1:22:05] you. But if really God is in your
[1:22:08] life, the fear of God will always come
[1:22:13] down. Praise the name of our Lord. There
[1:22:16] is a hospital where we always take our
[1:22:18] children for
[1:22:20] treatment. And I believe this was
[1:22:22] Christmas
[1:22:24] time. So end of
[1:22:27] year that was last year. One of our
[1:22:29] child was
[1:22:30] sick. So in the evening, we're just in
[1:22:33] the hospital
[1:22:34] there. Now the nurses were
[1:22:38] coming. There was a party in the
[1:22:42] neighborhood and those nurses I'm told
[1:22:44] the way they were dressed.
[1:22:47] So one of the health workers there was
[1:22:50] attending to
[1:22:52] me and then when he came he told
[1:22:55] me my colleagues were fearing to come
[1:23:01] in they were afraid of
[1:23:07] you that they
[1:23:12] have skimp clothes.
[1:23:17] But now if you're one of the consumers
[1:23:19] of their
[1:23:22] things, they come and stand before you
[1:23:24] find it like
[1:23:26] that. So you have no
[1:23:29] testimony. Somebody will
[1:23:33] come, shakes your
[1:23:35] hand with a dirty
[1:23:39] joke, there's something wrong in your
[1:23:41] life. How will you win that person to
[1:23:43] Christ?
[1:23:45] If they identify you to be having
[1:23:47] feeding on those dirty
[1:23:50] things, when you go on Tik Tok, you see
[1:23:54] something dirty, you press
[1:23:58] like, what are you feeding
[1:24:01] on, how are you going to win them to
[1:24:03] Christ?
[1:24:06] But yet when you are meant to be in
[1:24:08] their
[1:24:10] mid, the fear of God should come
[1:24:13] down and they will try to be
[1:24:19] careful. I don't have many talkative but
[1:24:22] because he's so much in the business of
[1:24:27] dirt when he come you just keep quiet
[1:24:32] cuz he has nothing to talk to.
[1:24:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So what
[1:24:38] kind of life do we have before they
[1:24:41] speak? If you're not different from
[1:24:43] them, they are going to win you to their
[1:24:46] side.
[1:24:48] which
[1:24:53] comes and is the one who rents in the
[1:24:55] next
[1:24:59] room. You have the power to
[1:25:03] chase actually your presence in that
[1:25:05] place
[1:25:07] alone will destabilize all those
[1:25:13] forces. They will destabilize them.
[1:25:15] People will not be comforted who do
[1:25:19] witchcraft because there's a presence of
[1:25:22] God and you can use that presence of
[1:25:25] God to testify to them that the things
[1:25:29] they are in are
[1:25:31] destructive and you tell them come to
[1:25:34] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:25:36] That's what we are meant to
[1:25:38] be. Praise the name of our Lord. Then
[1:25:41] you have neighbors who all the time
[1:25:47] And for you like going in their
[1:25:49] company and the Bible says blessed are
[1:25:53] they who don't sit in the seat of
[1:25:57] scorners but now for you you like
[1:26:00] sitting in the seat of
[1:26:02] sconers. How are you going to testify to
[1:26:04] them about the Lord
[1:26:06] Jesus? They will not believe you.
[1:26:21] How are you going to turn them to
[1:26:23] Christ when your conduct is not better
[1:26:26] than
[1:26:31] them? You can't win them. They don't see
[1:26:35] any difference in
[1:26:37] you. So we need to see that the life of
[1:26:40] Christ
[1:26:42] is projected in our
[1:26:45] lives. The glory of God is around
[1:26:48] us. So when you speak, the word that
[1:26:52] comes out of your
[1:26:54] mouth has power to convict the
[1:26:58] person. Praise the name of it. It has
[1:27:00] power. He may not respond to you there
[1:27:03] and there, but when he goes back, he
[1:27:06] thinks about that. It troubles him. And
[1:27:10] sometimes that's how people even come
[1:27:13] back. You may not necessarily be
[1:27:15] preaching the
[1:27:17] gospel. But you are just talking because
[1:27:19] it the Christ is part of
[1:27:21] you. And when you start
[1:27:24] talking, even those people are
[1:27:27] troubled. They find they getting
[1:27:32] calmness. When they go away, then they
[1:27:35] remember I came when I was
[1:27:37] disturbed. Everything has gone away.
[1:27:39] Then again they like coming around
[1:27:42] you because you create an
[1:27:45] atmosphere and that
[1:27:48] atmosphere can bring conversion to
[1:27:51] someone. You just tell them can you
[1:27:53] accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:27:56] person? Can you come and we pray with us
[1:27:58] on
[1:27:59] Sunday or what scripture have you read
[1:28:02] today? You are challenging them into the
[1:28:05] things of
[1:28:06] God until they start becoming
[1:28:10] aware and finally you can bring them to
[1:28:13] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:28:16] Each and every one of
[1:28:18] us, we are called
[1:28:21] upon to testify about the
[1:28:25] Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. Then
[1:28:27] he says in that message paragraph
[1:28:32] 228, "Young
[1:28:35] preacher, get into the
[1:28:39] field, stay in the
[1:28:42] harness, all you young
[1:28:45] preachers and
[1:28:47] things, don't sit
[1:28:49] around, don't just sit and do
[1:28:54] nothing. Get out yonder.
[1:28:57] and win a
[1:28:59] soul. Do
[1:29:01] something. Get on. Get
[1:29:04] moving. Don't
[1:29:06] stop. Young preacher over
[1:29:09] there. Praise the name of says do
[1:29:13] something.
[1:29:15] Testify. Praise the name of you know we
[1:29:18] shouldn't just come and do evangelism in
[1:29:21] the church.
[1:29:28] You know their parents also outside
[1:29:31] there. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:29:35] Testify. Tell them about the goodness of
[1:29:38] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Your
[1:29:41] friends you walk
[1:29:42] with, your colleagues you study with,
[1:29:45] your neighborhood or the stranger or
[1:29:49] business
[1:29:50] associate. You know maybe they have come
[1:29:52] to buy something like that. You can
[1:29:55] start a conversation about Christ. You
[1:29:58] can start a conversation about the
[1:29:59] goodness of
[1:30:01] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[1:30:03] brother Brandham had gone to
[1:30:07] hunting and then he was with one of the
[1:30:10] brothers in
[1:30:12] church and then the brother knew the
[1:30:14] other
[1:30:16] family and then he talked to that old
[1:30:18] man.
[1:30:20] We've come here to do
[1:30:21] hunting said I have I have come with my
[1:30:25] pastor. Are you so a child to walk with
[1:30:28] your
[1:30:30] pastor? Praise the name of you can come
[1:30:33] and close the
[1:30:34] water. So then he
[1:30:37] said you are you so to come with your
[1:30:40] your
[1:30:41] pastor brother now got
[1:30:44] out said how are you sir? Then this man
[1:30:49] was like for walking with the pastor for
[1:30:52] what? And then started
[1:30:55] riding there's no god there's no
[1:30:59] nothing. And then brother Brandham
[1:31:01] started using
[1:31:03] nature to preach to him
[1:31:06] Christ. Praise the name of that is where
[1:31:09] you can start
[1:31:10] from and show them Christ. At the end of
[1:31:14] the day that man was converted.
[1:31:19] He was turned to
[1:31:21] Christ. So you don't wait and
[1:31:26] say no. Even where you were, you can
[1:31:29] start to
[1:31:32] fire at your home, your neighbors, the
[1:31:36] shop. You go to buy
[1:31:38] things, they know you that you pay your
[1:31:42] debts, you don't
[1:31:44] cheat.
[1:31:46] Introduce them
[1:31:49] Christ. Praise the name of our introduce
[1:31:52] to them Christ. Let them know Christ.
[1:31:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:31:58] message the end
[1:32:00] time. He says it is not
[1:32:04] fair that one person hear the gospel
[1:32:14] twice. when somebody has not heard it
[1:32:19] once. See,
[1:32:22] everybody should hear the
[1:32:25] gospel at least
[1:32:28] once and I want to do my
[1:32:32] part to take the
[1:32:35] gospel to everybody that I know
[1:32:40] how every place that should be our
[1:32:44] desire.
[1:32:46] Let them know the Bible
[1:32:48] says be ready to testify about the faith
[1:32:51] that you
[1:32:53] have. Why do you believe how you
[1:32:56] believe? Why do you believe God has sent
[1:32:59] us a
[1:33:00] prophet? Why do you believe we have a
[1:33:02] message of the
[1:33:03] hour preparing the bride for the
[1:33:07] rapture and sometimes where you are
[1:33:10] working or in your scripture in your at
[1:33:14] school those people said they are
[1:33:17] saved but they don't know that we have a
[1:33:19] message to prepare us for the
[1:33:22] rapture introduce to them the message so
[1:33:26] my friends praise the name of the
[1:33:28] Lord know that Christ is coming for
[1:33:32] his challenge them. Say how what do you
[1:33:36] mean? No. Tell them we have a
[1:33:40] message. Give them about the
[1:33:42] testimony. What the Lord has done in our
[1:33:46] age. Praise the name of our Lord. Talk
[1:33:48] to them about the life of brother
[1:33:51] Brand sent him with a
[1:33:54] message. Ask for the rapture. came and
[1:33:58] testify and that's when maybe you can
[1:34:00] say
[1:34:01] ah I I want to hear more of
[1:34:04] this. Praise the name of our Lord. Take
[1:34:07] interest in doing
[1:34:09] that. Like we have our website
[1:34:12] here. It has all the the timeline of the
[1:34:17] prophet, the things that the Lord
[1:34:20] did, the key
[1:34:23] events, you know, which you can share
[1:34:25] with
[1:34:26] somebody. He's a prophet. God sent
[1:34:29] us. He prophesied about the second world
[1:34:33] war. He's prophesied about this and all
[1:34:37] these things have come to
[1:34:39] pass and then testify to them. God took
[1:34:43] him where he's taking the people in
[1:34:46] heaven. There is a one pastor in
[1:34:49] Campala.
[1:34:51] She said she went to
[1:34:53] heaven. But when she went to heaven, why
[1:34:55] she saw
[1:34:57] three, the father was too tall and he
[1:34:59] couldn't see the
[1:35:02] eyes. And then the son was a little bit
[1:35:05] short. And then the Holy Ghost was very
[1:35:09] short. When the prophets were only
[1:35:11] seeing
[1:35:12] one, the prophets were seeing
[1:35:15] one seeing
[1:35:17] three. Tell them about what the Lord has
[1:35:22] done. Praise the name of you
[1:35:26] testify. I think about last
[1:35:29] month. I sent some kind of tract on
[1:35:32] water
[1:35:34] baptism forum.
[1:35:38] You can print it
[1:35:40] out and then you share it with your
[1:35:43] friends. Baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:35:46] Christ. Baptism by
[1:35:49] immersion. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:35:52] Even the timelines of the
[1:35:54] prophet. We have it printed out.
[1:36:01] So you can say I want the Uganda
[1:36:02] version.
[1:36:04] I want the English version. You go and
[1:36:07] read it yourself. When you're talking to
[1:36:10] a person, you know what you're talking
[1:36:12] about. You can tell them this is the
[1:36:16] truth. All these things are here. But
[1:36:19] what interest do you have in
[1:36:22] them? How do you use them or they just
[1:36:27] there? Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:36:29] he says every person should hear the
[1:36:32] gospel.
[1:36:34] Then he says, "And you
[1:36:38] know, okay, let me start from
[1:36:45] here. I believe that every
[1:36:49] Christian is
[1:36:51] obligated to be a
[1:36:55] missionary. I believe every
[1:36:58] Christian is obligated
[1:37:04] Now, not so much as you have you have to
[1:37:07] go over in the old countries and preach
[1:37:16] something. Then he says, but if you
[1:37:18] can't
[1:37:20] go, you can send somebody
[1:37:23] else. Praise the name of the Lord. Each
[1:37:27] and every one of
[1:37:29] us, we have an
[1:37:33] obligation to be a
[1:37:35] missionary to testify about the goodness
[1:37:37] of
[1:37:38] God. Your neighbors, let them know about
[1:37:41] them. Let them know what you
[1:37:44] believe. Your friends, let them know
[1:37:46] what you
[1:37:47] believe. Your family, let them know what
[1:37:49] you
[1:37:50] believe. Where you standing from, let
[1:37:52] them know what you believe.
[1:37:54] You know there are friends you find that
[1:37:56] you can even eat the same
[1:37:59] thing. You can even get maybe and you
[1:38:02] break it and
[1:38:05] eat. Do they know what you
[1:38:11] believe? That one is my friend and he's
[1:38:14] my real friend. Do they know what you
[1:38:16] believe?
[1:38:19] Like know some people when they coming
[1:38:21] for their
[1:38:22] weddings, their friends are either they
[1:38:25] are groomsmen or
[1:38:29] maids or the best
[1:38:33] man, but they don't know what you
[1:38:36] believe. And then he said, "These are my
[1:38:41] friends. This one is my friend. Do they
[1:38:43] know what you believe?
[1:38:47] Have you testified to them about what
[1:38:49] you've
[1:38:50] done? Sometimes you're at a place of
[1:38:53] work. You have
[1:38:55] responsibility. You have a role, but
[1:38:58] things of God are far from
[1:39:01] you. You don't want to tell people about
[1:39:04] what you
[1:39:06] believe. You can't even people God bless
[1:39:13] you. You know, let them know
[1:39:17] I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:39:19] Christ. How has the Lord kept
[1:39:22] you? You see people are getting
[1:39:24] accidents.
[1:39:26] You know some people don't know that
[1:39:27] it's God who protect
[1:39:28] them. But you yourself you can tell them
[1:39:32] it's God who kept you at night. It's God
[1:39:35] who healed you. It's God who saved from
[1:39:37] this
[1:39:38] accident. You are drawing their mind to
[1:39:40] think about
[1:39:42] Christ. Learn how to appreciate God.
[1:39:47] And then from there you can start off
[1:39:49] slowly
[1:39:51] slowly or somebody can give you a
[1:39:53] testimony. You know I was
[1:39:56] coming
[1:39:59] crashing. Oh I cried Lord help
[1:40:02] me. We thank God for that. Keep on
[1:40:05] introducing more and
[1:40:08] more. No introduce Christ to
[1:40:11] them. the goodness of the
[1:40:14] Lord, not
[1:40:20] just you will find Christianity
[1:40:23] somewhere else. You are the one to take
[1:40:24] it to them. You are the one to
[1:40:27] testify. Tell them about the
[1:40:30] goodness. Praise the name of Or maybe
[1:40:33] you are in a
[1:40:35] tax.
[1:40:37] Testify. You can talk to the neighbor
[1:40:40] around you.
[1:40:43] testify about
[1:40:45] Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:40:48] each and every one of
[1:40:49] us, we have a
[1:40:52] responsibility to
[1:40:55] testify of our Lord Jesus Christ. What
[1:40:58] the Lord has
[1:41:00] done. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:41:03] see that you do
[1:41:05] it. Pray about
[1:41:08] it. God guide me.
[1:41:11] Praise the name of Lord. Now in the
[1:41:13] message the great
[1:41:15] commission he
[1:41:18] says this is known as the great
[1:41:22] commission. It was the last words that
[1:41:25] our Lord
[1:41:29] spoke. And the first time he sent out
[1:41:31] his disciples in M chapter
[1:41:35] 10 we find that he gave them a
[1:41:38] commission to go and heal the sick.
[1:41:43] cleanse the
[1:41:44] lepers, raise the dead, cast out
[1:41:48] devils. As you've received, freely give.
[1:41:57] The last
[1:41:58] commission he give go into the
[1:42:02] world just continue as they did at the
[1:42:08] first sick lay hands on the sick and
[1:42:13] cast out
[1:42:14] devils. It's a privilege for
[1:42:16] me,
[1:42:18] brethren, to stand with men shouldertosh
[1:42:21] shoulder.
[1:42:24] And then he
[1:42:31] says, "I take my position by your side
[1:42:35] as one who
[1:42:39] believeth." That the commission is still
[1:42:42] just as essential as it was when it was
[1:42:44] given.
[1:42:48] In this great
[1:42:50] field that we are in, we find many
[1:42:54] times that we come with the order of
[1:42:57] different
[1:43:01] domination. Note of the
[1:43:04] scripture. Some of them Christ's
[1:43:08] commission here was to go into all the
[1:43:14] world and preach the gospel. Now the
[1:43:18] gospel doesn't consist of the word
[1:43:23] only but through the power and
[1:43:26] manifestation of the Holy
[1:43:29] Spirit because that the only
[1:43:34] way it can be done for the signs shall
[1:43:39] follow would be the word take
[1:43:42] life. So it would have to be the Holy
[1:43:47] Spirit that would give
[1:43:50] life in the word to produce these
[1:43:54] signs. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:43:57] he's talking about the great
[1:43:59] commission. It is still
[1:44:03] ongoing. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:44:06] Testifying about the name of
[1:44:08] God. When you hear this person is
[1:44:11] sick, you can tell the next person, "Let
[1:44:15] us pray for that person." You humble
[1:44:17] yourself and pray for that person. And
[1:44:20] then sometimes you'll hear a
[1:44:22] testimony. You remember the prayers you
[1:44:24] offered the other
[1:44:26] time, person was
[1:44:28] healed, then they need to get
[1:44:30] saved. Or you tell this person, you need
[1:44:33] to accept the
[1:44:35] Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:44:37] know, you don't stop at the
[1:44:39] healing, all the signs and the
[1:44:42] wonders, the
[1:44:44] appearances. Tell them about eternal
[1:44:47] life. Praise the name of that's how the
[1:44:50] gospel should go on.
[1:44:55] Like when you're coming to church, there
[1:44:58] are people can tell
[1:45:00] you, you can't pray for us good, but you
[1:45:04] need to be saved.
[1:45:06] You can tell them you need to receive
[1:45:09] eternal life yourself
[1:45:11] also. Praise the name of our Lord. Not
[1:45:14] just stopping at
[1:45:16] that. Bring eternal life down to
[1:45:20] them. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:45:23] Christ commanded
[1:45:24] us to go out into all the
[1:45:28] world and preach the
[1:45:30] gospel. Live the life of the gospel.
[1:45:34] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:45:37] win souls to
[1:45:40] Christ. And then there's a message I was
[1:45:43] reading and then brother Brandham was
[1:45:45] talking about preaching to every
[1:45:48] creature says in the message five
[1:45:50] definite identification of the true
[1:45:58] church. He says how many knows what the
[1:46:01] gospel is?
[1:46:04] Not the word. Paul said the gospel come
[1:46:08] to us not in word
[1:46:12] only but through the power and
[1:46:14] manifestation of the Holy
[1:46:17] Spirit. The gospel is the power of
[1:46:21] God to make the word act what it
[1:46:26] say. Preach the gospel all the world.
[1:46:31] preach the gospel to just the white
[1:46:34] people or the brown
[1:46:39] people to every creature.
[1:46:43] Every
[1:46:44] creature you believe that means
[1:46:48] that then he gives a
[1:46:51] testimony. You know he gives a testimony
[1:46:53] of a
[1:46:54] bull. I seen God buff a bull one day.
[1:47:04] I seen him cause hornness to not to
[1:47:09] sting. I seen him raise up an opam that
[1:47:12] had been lying dead all
[1:47:21] night. The gospel will take effect upon
[1:47:25] anything that you ask.
[1:47:30] Amen. Amen. So it is to every
[1:47:34] creature you know even he says you can
[1:47:37] say to this
[1:47:38] mountain you are preaching the gospel be
[1:47:42] moved from here go there that's gospel
[1:47:46] you can say to this
[1:47:47] tree up here go the other direction
[1:47:51] that's the gospel now if it can affect
[1:47:54] those
[1:47:56] things how about your
[1:47:58] friends how about your colleagues weeks.
[1:48:01] How about your family? How do you do
[1:48:05] it? Start by praying for
[1:48:08] them. Start by praying for them.
[1:48:21] that one has brought him to
[1:48:23] me. Lord, he doesn't know
[1:48:26] you. Pray for them. Intercede for them.
[1:48:30] Lord, I pray you open his eyes to hear
[1:48:32] the
[1:48:33] truth and do the best you can
[1:48:37] to your family, pray for them, intercede
[1:48:41] for them. Open their eyes. Lord, may you
[1:48:45] deliver them. or your colleagues at
[1:48:47] place of
[1:48:48] work, start by praying for
[1:48:52] them and then show them the goodness of
[1:48:54] the
[1:48:55] Lord. You don't go to them and start
[1:48:58] condemning
[1:49:02] them before you bring them to
[1:49:06] Christ. Testify to them, the Lord loves
[1:49:10] you, does this and this and this. Show
[1:49:14] them the door is still open.
[1:49:17] Start by praying for
[1:49:19] them. Testify to them what the Lord has
[1:49:23] done for you. Invite them to the church.
[1:49:26] On Sunday we have a
[1:49:28] service. Can you have time and you come
[1:49:30] and pray with
[1:49:31] us? This time we are going to do this
[1:49:33] and
[1:49:34] this. Involve
[1:49:37] them. If you can visit
[1:49:39] them, pray with their families. you hear
[1:49:42] they have a problem. Tell them I'm going
[1:49:45] to pray for you on this
[1:49:46] issue. What are you doing? You are
[1:49:49] drawing them closer to
[1:49:52] God. Praise the name of the Lord. Then
[1:49:55] he says Jesus said to that
[1:49:59] tree, cast be
[1:50:01] you. No man eat from you from hence
[1:50:05] forth. The gospel was preached to that
[1:50:08] tree.
[1:50:11] Every
[1:50:12] creature preach it to
[1:50:15] what? Every
[1:50:18] creature. How about your friends? How
[1:50:21] about the
[1:50:22] strangers? Talk to them about
[1:50:25] Christ. How the Lord loves you. How the
[1:50:28] Lord has come to save you. Each and
[1:50:31] every one of
[1:50:32] us we can testify about the goodness
[1:50:42] of they cannot listen to
[1:50:46] me. I am the smallest at the job. There
[1:50:51] was the smallest person at a
[1:50:55] job. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[1:50:58] that was a maid.
[1:51:01] But she saw the
[1:51:03] master with
[1:51:06] leprosy. What did she do? She talked to
[1:51:09] her
[1:51:12] mistress.
[1:51:13] Madam, if master can go to
[1:51:17] Israel, there is a prophet in
[1:51:20] Israel who can heal him. But that
[1:51:23] prophet had never healed
[1:51:25] anybody. This is what Jesus says that
[1:51:28] how many lepers were there in the days
[1:51:30] of
[1:51:32] Elisha and only one was killed. But God
[1:51:36] put it upon this girl to testify about
[1:51:40] him. And when the mistress
[1:51:43] heard told her husband said that in
[1:51:46] Israel there's somebody who can heal
[1:51:48] you. Then the nan went to the king of
[1:51:52] Syria. The king of Syria wrote to the
[1:51:54] king of Israel.
[1:51:57] And then the king of Israel when he
[1:51:58] wrote the when he read the
[1:51:59] letter he told said this man wants to
[1:52:02] start a
[1:52:04] conflict. Then Elisha heard it and said
[1:52:08] tell him to
[1:52:09] come praise the name of and then went
[1:52:14] with all his maybe group of
[1:52:17] sias. And when Elisha saw that they were
[1:52:21] outside, he
[1:52:23] sent him dip yourself seven times in
[1:52:29] Jordan. Praise the name of that was the
[1:52:33] gospel. So you may be the least at your
[1:52:36] place of
[1:52:38] work. You may be the least at your home.
[1:52:42] If really God has revealed himself to
[1:52:45] you, you can testify about what the Lord
[1:52:48] has
[1:52:48] done. Tell them you can bring conversion
[1:52:52] in your
[1:52:53] family. God has picked you
[1:52:56] alone. You can
[1:52:58] testify as many others can
[1:53:01] believe one by one, one by one, one by
[1:53:05] one, one by one. So the thing is don't
[1:53:09] shut up your mouth.
[1:53:12] Tell them about the goodness
[1:53:14] of maybe if they are youth at home and
[1:53:17] your fellow
[1:53:19] youth. The girls like going out with
[1:53:23] boys or the boys like going out to pick
[1:53:27] girls different from
[1:53:29] them. Live
[1:53:32] upright and start praying for your
[1:53:35] brothers or
[1:53:37] sisters them. Don't deliver them and
[1:53:41] testify to them. Don't start condemning
[1:53:46] them. You will die HIV from there.
[1:53:49] You'll be there. Talk to them sweetly.
[1:53:52] I'm praying for you that you may be
[1:53:55] converted. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:53:58] See how you bring souls into
[1:54:00] Christ. How you can encourage
[1:54:03] them. Come to the Lord. Come to the
[1:54:06] waters. Come and drink of the
[1:54:10] fountain and be compassionate to
[1:54:15] them. Praise the name of Lord. Maybe
[1:54:18] they come back from their disco halls at
[1:54:22] night. In the
[1:54:25] night open for
[1:54:29] us, you you'll sleep there and they will
[1:54:33] they will rape you from there. No, just
[1:54:36] you'll be arrested from
[1:54:39] there. Okay. You see, see that you show
[1:54:42] kindness to
[1:54:45] them. Say, but you've gone there. It is
[1:54:48] wrong. Don't do it
[1:54:50] again. See that you keep on talking to
[1:54:53] them the goodness of the
[1:54:55] Lord and when they do
[1:54:58] evil, don't wish them
[1:55:01] [Music]
[1:55:03] evil. is paying for what he did. No, say
[1:55:07] Lord have mercy upon
[1:55:09] me. You are preaching to them. They'll
[1:55:12] say ah there is sweetness
[1:55:15] here. Praise the name of like now people
[1:55:18] at home if they start fighting each
[1:55:21] other you also
[1:55:24] say you also say that I said this abuse.
[1:55:28] The Bible says,
[1:55:30] you know, pay with
[1:55:32] good. They have done evil to you. Bring
[1:55:36] goodness there. Be
[1:55:39] different. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:55:41] If you are trying to win them to
[1:55:44] Christ, let them see that there is
[1:55:47] something
[1:55:49] better. They already
[1:55:52] bound. But you need to see that they can
[1:55:55] appreciate what you are having.
[1:56:00] Praise the name of our Lord. So testify
[1:56:02] to them. Pray for them. Praise the name
[1:56:06] of our Lord. Now let us go to the book
[1:56:08] of
[1:56:12] Acts. Acts chapter
[1:56:15] 16. And then verse
[1:56:24] 12. Acts 16:12. The Bible
[1:56:31] says, "And from then to Philip, which is
[1:56:35] the chief city of that part of
[1:56:36] Macedonia, and a colony, and we were in
[1:56:40] that city abiding certain days,
[1:57:05] And on the Sabbath day we went out of
[1:57:08] the city by a riverside where a prayer
[1:57:12] was to be made. And we sat down and
[1:57:15] spoke unto the women which resorted
[1:57:17] hither.
[1:57:35] He went where people
[1:57:38] gather. Maybe it's an evening you just
[1:57:42] retiring from place of
[1:57:45] work and then you meet some people
[1:57:47] somewhere.
[1:57:50] maybe doing
[1:57:51] something. Talk to them about the
[1:57:54] Lord. The Lord can save you. The Lord
[1:57:57] can deliver you. Now here Paul, they
[1:58:00] went to a place where people would
[1:58:02] gather for
[1:58:05] prayers. It was not like maybe it was a
[1:58:07] church or
[1:58:09] what. But people were gathering
[1:58:11] there and they got women there.
[1:58:16] Praise the name of you know
[1:58:21] nowadays people want groups so
[1:58:24] much
[1:58:31] groups I'm in the group of our
[1:58:35] neighbors and the meetings for groups
[1:58:38] happen on
[1:58:40] Sunday and you say that I will not come
[1:58:42] to church because they have a group
[1:58:44] meeting
[1:58:46] But when that group they don't know that
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:50] Christian the one who collects
[1:58:53] money the one who demands
[1:58:56] people they don't know that you're
[1:58:58] Christian about Christ to
[1:59:03] them you know this year we are getting
[1:59:05] into campaigns of
[1:59:07] politics and every political party is
[1:59:10] looking for new membersign
[1:59:16] here this year doing programs they're
[1:59:20] doing showing what they have
[1:59:23] done and this is our new member and then
[1:59:26] they move house to
[1:59:27] house you you you support our
[1:59:30] party the program is the truth is there
[1:59:34] are few people who are
[1:59:36] saved but we shouldn't give
[1:59:39] up in testifying about the gospel of
[1:59:42] Jesus and this is what Paul was
[1:59:45] doing where these women
[1:59:48] were in some of these places. There are
[1:59:51] people who sincerely want to hear the
[1:59:55] truth, but they are in deception
[1:59:57] wherever they
[1:59:59] are. They
[2:00:01] suffer. They punish
[2:00:04] themselves thinking that that's the
[2:00:07] truth. You can imagine somebody walking
[2:00:09] from
[2:00:14] for something which is not
[2:00:17] real. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[2:00:20] there are people who are seeking the
[2:00:23] truth and we have the
[2:00:26] truth. We need to reach out where they
[2:00:29] are. They may be at your place of
[2:00:33] work coming over
[2:00:36] there. Testify about the goodness of the
[2:00:39] Lord. Not that you will stop your work.
[2:00:42] But you can talk to them one or two
[2:00:45] words. God can heal you. God can deliver
[2:00:48] you. You can create a
[2:00:51] relationship to bring them to Christ. So
[2:00:54] here Paul and
[2:00:57] Silas. They were in this
[2:00:59] place and they went there to these
[2:01:03] women and spoke to them about the Lord
[2:01:07] Jesus.
[2:01:09] Each and every one of us we can do the
[2:01:12] same. You are in the market. Everybody
[2:01:15] is moving this way, this
[2:01:17] way. The person on their
[2:01:20] store. Then you talk to them about the
[2:01:23] Lord. Christ loves you. Please be saved.
[2:01:28] And then the Bible says in verse 14,
[2:01:30] "And a certain woman named Lydia, a
[2:01:33] seller of purple of the city of Tira,
[2:01:36] which worshiped God had us, whose heart
[2:01:39] the Lord opened, that she attended unto
[2:01:42] the things which were spoken of Paul.
[2:02:08] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[2:02:11] says she worshiped
[2:02:14] God. She desired God.
[2:02:18] So now when she heard the
[2:02:21] preaching, she
[2:02:23] said, "I'm believing
[2:02:26] that this is something that I've longed
[2:02:29] for." And then the Bible says, "God
[2:02:32] opened our
[2:02:34] heart and then she fully gave over her
[2:02:39] life. That's how we shall get the elect.
[2:02:44] We shall not get the elect by not
[2:02:46] testifying about the word of
[2:02:48] God. We shall not get the elect by not
[2:02:51] going
[2:02:53] out amongst
[2:02:55] us, where we work, where we study from,
[2:02:59] where we live. So it is now you take
[2:03:04] time and pray to God. Lord, I want you
[2:03:07] to use me to bring a soul into your
[2:03:10] kingdom. You're about it. And then
[2:03:13] you'll find the Lord leading you to the
[2:03:15] right
[2:03:16] path. You talk to them. Their hearts are
[2:03:20] open. No, this Sunday I want to come and
[2:03:22] be
[2:03:25] baptized. That was Lydia here. She
[2:03:28] woripped God, but she didn't know more
[2:03:31] than what she the region was.
[2:03:36] Paul speak about the Lord Jesus
[2:03:39] Christ and God opened her heart. And
[2:03:42] then the Bible says and she was
[2:03:45] baptized.
[2:03:47] Verse
[2:03:49] 15 and her
[2:03:53] household. See how the door opened
[2:03:56] up from one person and then the
[2:03:59] salvation goes to the whole
[2:04:02] family. Praise the name of God. We need
[2:04:05] to be
[2:04:07] witnesses.
[2:04:09] Testify. Let your neighbor know what you
[2:04:11] believe
[2:04:12] in. Let your colleagues know what you
[2:04:14] believe
[2:04:15] in. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[2:04:18] then she besought us
[2:04:20] saying, "If I have been judged to be
[2:04:23] faithful to the Lord, come into my house
[2:04:25] and abide there." And she constrained
[2:04:28] us.
[2:04:44] Amen. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[2:04:46] need to
[2:04:48] testify. How many souls have you brought
[2:04:51] into the
[2:04:52] kingdom? Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:04:55] Now in Luke 10 and verse
[2:04:59] one, after these things the Lord
[2:05:02] appointed 70 also, and sent them two and
[2:05:05] two before his face into every city and
[2:05:08] place, whether he himself would come.
[2:05:11] Therefore say ye unto them, the harvest
[2:05:14] truly is great, but the laborers are
[2:05:17] few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
[2:05:20] harvest that he would send forth
[2:05:22] laborers into the harvest. Go your ways.
[2:05:26] Behold, I send you forth as lambs among
[2:05:28] wolves. Luke 10 Luke 10 verse 1:3
[2:05:59] up to verse three.
[2:06:25] Praise the name of the Lord. He says the
[2:06:28] harvest is
[2:06:30] plenteous, but the laborers are
[2:06:33] few. You are one of the
[2:06:36] laborers. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:06:38] Go into the harvest of the Lord.
[2:06:42] The people God has ordained to
[2:06:45] eternally talk to them about the word of
[2:06:47] the
[2:06:48] Lord. Talk to them about
[2:06:51] salvation. How the Lord loves them. And
[2:06:54] many of these people said they are
[2:06:55] saved.
[2:06:57] Many people said they are saved, but
[2:07:00] they are not yet saved because the Bible
[2:07:03] says he that
[2:07:06] believeth and is
[2:07:08] baptized shall be saved. So you have
[2:07:11] somewhere where to start
[2:07:14] from. Take them to the book of
[2:07:17] Mark. We can pick up those scriptures as
[2:07:19] I try to
[2:07:21] finish. Praise the name of our Lord.
[2:07:24] Mark chapter 16.
[2:07:27] And then verse
[2:07:29] 16, the Bible says, "He that believeth
[2:07:32] and is
[2:07:35] baptized shall be saved." You can start
[2:07:38] from
[2:07:40] there testifying to your Pentecostal
[2:07:46] friends for Jesus Christ to be my
[2:07:49] savior. When were you
[2:07:51] baptized? when I was still young. Take
[2:07:54] them in the
[2:07:55] scriptures. Baptism for little
[2:07:58] children. Challenge
[2:08:00] them. Praise the name of the Lord. For
[2:08:03] the Bible says, he that believeth and is
[2:08:07] baptized, not he that is
[2:08:09] baptized and
[2:08:11] believeth. Oh, show them these
[2:08:17] things. Tell them it was wrong. It's not
[2:08:21] in the Bible.
[2:08:22] Show them where these
[2:08:24] scripture. You first
[2:08:26] believe then you are
[2:08:28] baptized and then you are
[2:08:31] saved. Somebody will be
[2:08:33] challenged. Now what do you mean? You
[2:08:36] mean baptizing little children is
[2:08:39] wrong. Yes, it is
[2:08:41] wrong. And then others were baptizing
[2:08:44] the titles father, son and
[2:08:46] holy. Tell them father is not a name.
[2:08:50] Holy Ghost is not a name. There's only
[2:08:53] one name of the father, the son, and the
[2:08:55] holy
[2:08:56] ghost. And that is the Lord Jesus
[2:08:58] Christ.
[2:09:00] Testify. You know, you you have people
[2:09:03] who would want to go into the
[2:09:06] Bible. Use the Bible to win them to
[2:09:10] Christ. Praise the name of you see
[2:09:13] that's how started his
[2:09:15] ministry with people of like mind.
[2:09:24] They were reading the scrolls of
[2:09:28] Moses. So he would also use the same
[2:09:33] scrolls to show them
[2:09:35] Christ. They read the Bible, use the
[2:09:38] same Bible to show them we have a
[2:09:41] message of the
[2:09:42] earth. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[2:09:45] must know what you believe.
[2:09:48] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Luke
[2:09:51] chapter
[2:09:53] 24 and then verse 47,
[2:09:57] he says, "And that repentance and
[2:10:00] remission of sins should be preached in
[2:10:03] every in his name among all nations
[2:10:07] beginning at Jerusalem.
[2:10:18] He says
[2:10:19] repentance and remission of
[2:10:21] sins. Somebody may have
[2:10:24] repented, but the question is, have your
[2:10:27] sins been
[2:10:29] remitted? You can challenge them on
[2:10:31] this. Somebody say, "Hey, you mean I can
[2:10:35] repent and I'm not
[2:10:37] forgiven?" Yes. The Bible says
[2:10:40] repentance and
[2:10:43] remission then you can take them to Acts
[2:10:45] chapter
[2:10:47] 2 verse
[2:10:49] 38 repent every one of
[2:10:51] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:10:55] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:10:58] and tell them much as you accept the
[2:11:00] Lord as your personal
[2:11:02] such as you've repented you need to be
[2:11:05] baptized in the water in the name of
[2:11:08] Jesus.
[2:11:09] You are
[2:11:10] testifying. You are opening the door to
[2:11:14] them and don't be shy.
[2:11:18] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[2:11:20] you can have your your your Bible on the
[2:11:22] mobile
[2:11:24] phone and you know where to pick the
[2:11:27] scriptures and then you can talk to them
[2:11:29] about the
[2:11:32] scripture. That's what Paul was
[2:11:34] doing. He would use their very books
[2:11:39] show them where the stand is right
[2:11:42] now. Praise the name of our God. And
[2:11:45] then you know people don't know exactly
[2:11:47] what they
[2:11:49] believe but God has appointed
[2:11:53] you to teach them to testify to them of
[2:11:58] what the truth is. Praise the name of
[2:12:00] our Lord. Now just as we finish let us
[2:12:04] go to the book of Romans chapter 10.
[2:12:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Romans
[2:12:12] chapter 10.
[2:12:14] And then we start from
[2:12:17] verse 11. Start from verse 10. It says,
[2:12:21] "For with the heart man believeth unto
[2:12:24] righteousness, and with the mouth
[2:12:26] confession is made unto salvation.
[2:12:37] For the scripture says, "Whosoever
[2:12:39] believeth on him shall not be
[2:12:48] ashamed. For there is no difference
[2:12:50] between the Jew and the Greek. For the
[2:12:53] same Lord over all is reached unto all
[2:12:56] that call upon him.
[2:13:10] For whosoever shall call upon the name
[2:13:12] of the Lord shall be
[2:13:17] saved. And then he asks a question. How
[2:13:21] then shall they call on him in whom they
[2:13:23] have not believed?
[2:13:29] And how shall they believe in whom they
[2:13:32] have not
[2:13:35] heard? And how shall they hear without a
[2:13:41] preacher? So God has appointed
[2:13:45] you at your place of work to tell them
[2:13:49] about the gospel of Christ. How will
[2:13:52] they
[2:13:52] believe if they have not
[2:13:55] heard? Praise the name of our Lord. So
[2:13:58] one has to go and
[2:14:01] testify. We have we have the message of
[2:14:04] the hour. God has given us a message
[2:14:07] praying for the bride of
[2:14:10] Christ. Every one of us. We have a
[2:14:14] responsibility. Praise the name of our
[2:14:16] Lord. And then in Mark chapter
[2:14:20] 24 and then verse 14,
[2:14:24] the Bible says, "And this gospel of the
[2:14:26] kingdom shall be preached into all the
[2:14:29] world for witness unto all nations, and
[2:14:32] then shall the end
[2:14:43] come." Praise the name of our Lord. He
[2:14:45] says this
[2:14:48] gospel, which
[2:14:50] gospel, this end time
[2:14:54] gospel, this message of the
[2:14:57] hour shall be preached in all the
[2:15:00] world. Praise the name of our Lord and
[2:15:03] God has opened your heart to
[2:15:06] it. May your mouth also open to testify
[2:15:09] about it.
[2:15:12] talking to the
[2:15:13] friends, talking to your neighbors,
[2:15:16] talking to your colleagues, talking to
[2:15:18] the
[2:15:19] strangers about the message of the
[2:15:23] hour. Praise the name of let us take
[2:15:26] interest in the things of
[2:15:29] God. See that you have these things with
[2:15:32] you. Praise the name of And God willing,
[2:15:35] next
[2:15:36] Sunday, I believe we shall try to print
[2:15:39] out as many tracks on water
[2:15:48] baptism about the timeline of the
[2:15:51] prophet, brother, the things God did we
[2:15:55] have both in English and in
[2:15:58] Uganda such that each of us can pick a
[2:16:00] copy of those things.
[2:16:04] and read
[2:16:05] them so that it's not difficult for you
[2:16:09] to testify about what you
[2:16:11] believe. You know what water
[2:16:14] baptism? You know the message we have.
[2:16:17] You can tell somebody and
[2:16:19] testify. You pray to God to guide
[2:16:22] you to help you that you can bring a
[2:16:25] soul into Christ. Praise the name of our
[2:16:28] Lord. No, brother Brandham says if you
[2:16:31] have not won any soul to
[2:16:34] Christ, you are barren.
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:42] But there's a way to
[2:16:44] produce, get the life of Christ in
[2:16:47] you and then you'll
[2:16:50] produce. You bring a soul to the
[2:16:53] kingdom. May God bless you so
[2:16:56] much. Amen. Amen.
[2:17:00] Let us sing that
[2:17:05] song. The Lord of harvest. Oh, whom
[2:17:08] shall I send? Praise the name of our

[2:19:16] be.
[2:19:17] [Music]
[2:19:21] When the voice of God said, "Oh, go for
[2:19:30] us." Then he
[2:19:35] answered
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:39] me,
[2:19:40] "Speak my Lord.
