[24:13] [Music]
[24:21] foreign
[24:27] [Music]
[25:05] now another oh
[25:07] [Music]
[25:17] shall be changed
[25:26] foreign
[25:27] [Music]
[26:04] amen praise
[26:06] [Music]
[26:10] amen let us pray
[26:12] father we thank you for this morning
[26:15] what a confession we are confessing
[26:18] that each of us will be changed we are
[26:22] so thankful father that we are not
[26:25] confessing it in vain
[26:27] but Lord you've shown us
[26:30] that people have been changed before our
[26:33] lord Jesus was changed and we have a
[26:36] promised Lord
[26:43] that is waiting foreign
[26:55] [Music]
[27:30] foreign
[28:20] we go to First Corinthians
[28:23] soccer First Corinthians chapter 15
[28:26] soccer yes we are reading from verse 51
[28:33] up to verse 57.
[28:41] the scripture says behold I show you a
[28:45] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[28:48] shall all be changed
[28:59] at the last for the trumpet shall
[29:03] sound and the day shall be raised
[29:05] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[29:16] foreign
[29:21] must put on the an incorruption and this
[29:25] motto must put on immortality
[29:38] so when this corruptible shall have put
[29:41] on incorruption and this motto shall
[29:43] over put on immortality then shall be
[29:47] brought to pass the same that's written
[29:49] death is swallowed up in Victory or
[29:53] death where is thy sting or grave where
[29:56] is thy Victory The Sting of death is
[29:59] seen and the strength of sin is the law
[30:02] but thanks be to God which gives us
[30:04] Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:08] foreign
[30:40] HB
[30:46] um
[31:02] so my subject is we shall be changed
[31:07] and the scripture emphasizes it several
[31:10] times
[31:12] Universe 51.
[31:15] we shall all be changed
[31:22] he says we shall be changed
[31:26] praise the name of Allah how many of us
[31:29] believe we are going to be changed
[31:33] that should be your confession
[31:37] praise the name of our Lord that I shall
[31:40] be changed
[31:42] praise the name of our Lord it doesn't
[31:45] matter what you are going through
[31:48] but that should be your confession
[31:51] I shall be changed
[31:54] from this motto
[31:57] to an immortal body
[32:00] because that's the promise of Allah
[32:04] that's the promise of our Lord
[32:07] if our hearts
[32:10] have received The Incorruptible word
[32:16] praise the name of Allah then that very
[32:19] incorruptive word
[32:21] if it grows in our hearts
[32:25] it will also make us incorruptive
[32:29] that's how it begins life is you
[32:33] receiving the word The Incorruptible
[32:58] literally every one of us
[33:10] now when the heaven is passing away
[33:14] and the Earth is passing away where will
[33:17] you be
[33:20] all of us want to be in heaven and they
[33:23] desire to be in heaven
[33:25] now when the heaven is passing away and
[33:28] the Earth is passing away where are you
[33:31] going to be
[33:32] now that puzzles people again Heaven is
[33:35] going to pass away then somebody says no
[33:38] it is not going to pass away I've been
[33:40] in heaven but the Bible says going to
[33:42] pass away
[33:45] so where are you going to be when the
[33:49] heaven is passing away wow
[33:51] you think about it where are you going
[33:55] to be when the heaven is passing away
[33:58] but you see the scripture
[34:01] answers that question he says Heaven and
[34:05] Earth will pass away
[34:08] but my word will never pass away so
[34:12] where will you be
[34:17] because it is the word of God that
[34:20] created the heavens and the Earth
[34:23] and now the same word of God that
[34:27] created the heavens and the Earth is the
[34:29] same word of God that God gives us
[34:33] and he says be born again by The
[34:37] Incorruptible word of God
[34:40] so when you receive the word you are
[34:44] receiving something
[34:45] you are receiving something which is
[34:49] greater than the heaven
[34:50] something which is greater than the
[34:52] earth
[34:53] praise the name of Allah so when the
[34:56] heaven is passing away when the earth is
[34:59] passing away we shall be in the word of
[35:02] God
[35:04] and we don't wait for that time to be in
[35:06] the word of God
[35:09] but right now we are in the word of God
[35:12] praise him in the name of our Lord so if
[35:15] we
[35:15] the word of God
[35:17] then we shall be changed
[35:20] from this motor body immortality
[35:26] foreign
[35:46] man that is born of a woman is over a
[35:49] few days and full of trouble he comes
[35:52] forth like a flower and is cut down he
[35:54] flees also as a shadow and continues not
[36:00] foreign
[36:28] it doesn't matter whatever thing you may
[36:31] try to do
[36:34] of course it is good to be careful
[36:38] it's good to be healthy it's good to
[36:41] take questions but it doesn't matter how
[36:44] much you may take questions yeah
[37:03] when I get to my children I'll take them
[37:05] to medical school
[37:12] but unfortunately you find that when
[37:15] they have just finished the medical
[37:16] school
[37:38] death just strikes anytime
[37:41] and you know
[37:45] call fights for this
[37:52] Village
[38:00] this just comes anywhere
[38:07] it comes everywhere
[38:10] you know you may say I know oh but me if
[38:13] I have a lot of money I will not die
[38:18] but death can strike anytime
[38:22] so the Bible is telling us man that is
[38:25] born of a woman is of a few days
[38:29] and those few days
[38:35] travel every time
[38:37] you wake up in the morning
[38:53] [Music]
[39:00] it can mean any kind of forms
[39:05] your business about business
[39:08] or any kind of thing can happen
[39:13] now booty so we see that the bodies that
[39:17] we get from our parents
[39:21] we get them as a result of sin today
[39:27] praise the name of our Lord because the
[39:30] Bible says that the wages of sin is this
[39:38] the wages of sin is this
[39:41] now because there was sin
[39:47] because there was sins
[39:53] [Music]
[39:57] Romans chapter 6 verse 23.
[40:03] for the wages of sin is death
[40:07] but the gift of God is eternal life
[40:10] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[40:22] praise the name of Allah so he says the
[40:25] wages of sin
[40:33] so the Bible goes ahead and tells us
[40:38] in Romans chapter five
[40:42] and then verse 12.
[40:46] the scripture says
[40:48] wherefore by one man sin entered into
[40:52] the world and the death by sin so death
[40:55] passed upon all men for all have sinned
[41:01] foreign
[41:24] [Music]
[41:32] was passed upon all men
[41:37] for all have seen
[41:40] now that is our first bus
[41:44] our birth from our parents
[41:48] qualifies us to be motto beings
[41:52] our back from our parents
[41:56] qualifies us to be corruptive beings
[42:00] our bathroom our parents
[42:04] qualifies us to live for a short time
[42:16] the second Adam
[42:19] our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:23] that changes the situation
[42:26] praise the name of Allah because by man
[42:30] came this is
[42:35] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[42:37] 21.
[42:43] for since my Man Came Death
[42:47] by man came also the resurrection of the
[42:50] Dead
[42:52] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[42:54] 21.
[43:07] to for us in Adam all die even so in
[43:13] Christ shall all be made alive
[43:26] so the first Adam
[43:29] from which we be we are begotten by our
[43:32] parents
[43:44] so until we are now born by the Lord
[43:48] Jesus Christ
[43:51] that's when we can say we cannot die
[43:56] that's when we can say we shall be king
[44:01] not of our own ability
[44:04] but the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:07] himself who lives in US
[44:11] changes us takes us New Creation
[44:15] when he makes us New Creations
[44:18] then we cannot die in sin anymore
[44:22] even when the body dies
[44:25] the Bible calls it you are sleeping
[44:30] and when you sleep you awake is
[44:37] the name of Allah when you sleep are you
[44:41] troubled when you're going to sleep when
[44:43] you're going to wake up
[44:58] you know
[45:02] but you have to wake up anyhow I don't
[45:04] know and wake up so the Saints in the
[45:08] Lord
[45:09] the Saints who are in the Lord
[45:14] the Bible tells us in first
[45:16] Thessalonians chapter 4 Bible yet
[45:20] and then verse 13.
[45:23] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[45:27] Brethren concerning them which are
[45:29] asleep that you saw or not even as
[45:33] others which have no hope
[45:47] sorry
[45:50] so verse 14 he says
[45:56] yes chapter 4 verse 13 verse 13.
[46:06] together
[46:09] [Music]
[46:24] Uganda
[46:25] is
[46:32] the Bible says who are asleep
[46:38] so some of them have slept for two
[46:41] thousand years
[46:43] but they will awake
[46:47] they have slain for two thousand years
[46:56] they slept for about four thousand years
[47:16] and then
[47:24] verse 51
[47:35] and behold the veil of the temples
[47:37] reigned in time from the top to the
[47:40] bottom and the Earth did quick and the
[47:43] Rocks rent
[47:48] Ed
[47:53] foreign
[48:05] [Music]
[48:23] and came out of the grapes after his
[48:26] resurrection and went into the holy city
[48:29] and appeared unto many Montana
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] is
[48:41] the name of Allah the Bible says many
[48:45] sins
[48:47] from Genesis
[48:52] you can count them
[48:54] one by one no one needs children no one
[48:59] have another you can you know
[49:09] write yourself
[49:11] and then you get to the days of you know
[49:14] Moses
[49:15] [Music]
[49:18] and then you get down all those people
[49:50] and then they are those who
[49:53] around that okay
[50:14] so the Bible has told us
[50:18] a rose
[50:26] so in
[50:30] English
[50:31] the scripture is telling us
[50:34] we should not
[50:37] them
[50:42] assembly
[50:50] [Music]
[50:56] just sleeping they're just waiting for a
[51:00] time to hear the voice
[51:04] and then they will arise
[51:06] and they will appear to us and we shall
[51:10] see them
[51:11] praise the name of us
[51:17] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 14.
[51:20] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[51:23] rose again what we designed yes we have
[51:27] foreign
[52:04] so when you sleep in Jesus
[52:18] have you been born again have you been
[52:22] born of the word of God have you been
[52:25] born of The Incorruptible word of God
[52:27] because it is by The Incorruptible word
[52:30] of God
[52:31] that you will arise
[52:34] that you will come out of the grace it's
[52:38] by The Incorruptible word of God
[52:41] that we shall be changed
[52:44] your name and the word of God has been
[52:48] given to us
[52:50] first Peter Peter
[52:52] and then chapter one
[52:55] praise the name of our Lord
[52:58] First Peter chapter one soccer
[53:03] and then verse 23 to verse 25.
[53:07] being born again not of the corruptible
[53:11] seed but of The Incorruptible by the
[53:14] word of God which liveth and abideth
[53:18] forever
[53:20] [Music]
[53:20] um
[53:30] foreign
[53:31] for All Flesh is as grass and all the
[53:36] glory of man as the flower of grass the
[53:39] grass with us and the flower they are
[53:41] all fedeth away
[53:42] um
[53:56] but the word of the Lord endureth
[53:59] forever and this is the word which by
[54:03] the gospel is preached unto you now
[54:17] praise the name of our Lord
[54:21] by The Incorruptible word of God
[54:29] now if we are we are born a gained by
[54:31] the word of God
[54:34] then we also leave forever
[54:38] because the word and
[54:41] ends forever
[54:44] the Bible says
[54:49] who shall go across the seas
[54:59] to bring him down oh shall go down in
[55:03] here
[55:04] but the Bible says the word is near you
[55:16] how far is your mouth from you
[55:19] how far is your heart from me now why
[55:23] does it talk about the heart
[55:25] why does he talk about them
[55:27] that when you hear the words
[55:32] you should believe it with your heart
[55:36] and when you believe it with your heart
[55:41] press it with your mouth and that's how
[55:44] you become part of the world you hear
[55:47] the word Lord I receive D this one Lord
[55:58] will be quickened by the holy spirit
[56:02] so then the Holy Spirit comes down in
[56:06] your heart
[56:08] praise the name of Allah
[56:11] baptism of the holy spirit is not
[56:16] complicated
[56:29] the spirit will come down
[56:46] and you get many Believers in that room
[56:50] of our brother I don't either have the
[56:52] Holy Ghost oh brother ah that church
[56:55] doesn't have the Holy Ghost oh brother
[57:04] foreign
[57:43] do you think getting the holy spirit is
[57:45] easy don't take
[57:47] it
[57:49] praise is
[57:53] and then one of the persons there was
[57:56] saying in the church
[57:59] and then it was encouraging people to be
[58:01] foolish virgins
[58:13] oh
[58:14] you know if there are Japanese and your
[58:16] left mirror you need to be prepared this
[58:18] message is not sent for the foolish
[58:20] virginity
[58:22] this message is sent for the election
[58:29] this message is sent to prepare the
[58:32] Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:37] now in our church
[58:46] how about you I tell you where
[58:49] foreign
[59:01] [Laughter]
[59:50] receive your wife
[59:56] the word is imparting the spiritual
[59:59] nature of Christ upon your life
[1:00:07] praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:13] so the Bible says
[1:00:17] and then verse 46
[1:00:19] then
[1:00:22] walked bold and said it was necessary
[1:00:25] that the word of
[1:00:28] God spoken unto you but seeing you put
[1:00:31] it away from you and judge yourselves
[1:00:34] and wonder of everlasting life law we
[1:00:38] turn to the Gentiles
[1:00:39] Paulo nebula
[1:00:43] nebulbas never
[1:00:48] foreign
[1:01:25] but you are rejecting it
[1:01:29] you are throwing it away
[1:01:31] you are refusing the word so what you
[1:01:35] are doing you are judging yourselves
[1:01:39] that you don't want
[1:01:41] eternal life
[1:01:43] you are Unworthy of eternal life
[1:01:46] like when the master sent invitations
[1:01:50] I'm saying big minute to come to my
[1:01:53] wedding
[1:01:56] and then they went to the people who are
[1:01:58] busy
[1:01:59] please come to the wedding they want the
[1:02:03] people who are walking on the street
[1:02:04] foreign
[1:03:04] indeed
[1:03:24] like we
[1:03:25] we kind of don't do evangelism around it
[1:03:29] and the first week many people hundreds
[1:03:32] of them were promising to come
[1:03:35] and then waiting on Sunday
[1:03:39] I don't know how many hours calling on
[1:03:41] foreign
[1:04:02] foreign
[1:04:23] so people judge the judge themselves not
[1:04:27] worthy
[1:04:28] but the invitation is given
[1:04:33] um
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:41] and this is what the Jews were judging
[1:04:44] themselves
[1:04:47] not worthy of eternal life
[1:04:51] and then in verse
[1:04:55] says for so as the Lord commanded us
[1:04:59] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[1:05:02] the Gentiles that those should be for
[1:05:05] salvation and to the ends of the Earth
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:22] and when the Gentiles had this they were
[1:05:26] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[1:05:29] and as men as we are ordained to eternal
[1:05:32] life believed
[1:05:35] that is
[1:05:53] when they told the Gentiles the gospel
[1:05:57] is foreign
[1:07:03] and then the Bible says
[1:07:05] blessed verse 1 blessed is the demand
[1:07:09] that works not in the cancer of the
[1:07:11] ungodly nor a standeth in the way of
[1:07:14] Sinners nor are sitteth in the seat of
[1:07:16] this cornful but his Delight is in the
[1:07:20] law of the Lord and in his Lord does he
[1:07:22] meditate day and night and he shall be
[1:07:25] like a trip planted by the rivers of
[1:07:27] water that bringeth forces fruit in this
[1:07:30] season his life also shall not wither or
[1:07:33] whatever he does he shall prosper
[1:07:37] foreign
[1:08:08] foreign
[1:08:19] foreign
[1:09:13] what you desire
[1:09:22] we will change your work
[1:09:25] you're not going to walk in the advice
[1:09:27] of people who are not right
[1:09:32] we will change your stance
[1:09:35] you're going you want to go and stand in
[1:09:37] the way of Sinners
[1:09:40] will change your city
[1:10:03] you know changes
[1:10:09] your heart's desires
[1:10:12] changes your speech
[1:10:15] changes your actions and that's how the
[1:10:18] word keeps on working upon us
[1:10:20] and then the Bible says the word is the
[1:10:24] seeds
[1:10:25] like now it's a planting season
[1:10:28] so when you plant the seed there
[1:10:32] the maturity may not be in one day
[1:10:36] but it has stages of growth and that is
[1:10:40] also the same thing with the word of God
[1:10:42] when you receive the word of God
[1:10:45] cherish it change it even if you still
[1:10:49] have weaknesses
[1:10:51] have weaknesses in your spirit
[1:10:53] transforms
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:27] how will your mind
[1:11:31] bad thing foreign
[1:12:32] yourself
[1:13:38] our daily life
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:14:00] he gives us a seal of the holy spirit
[1:14:05] so then it is your soul that has been
[1:14:08] redeemed
[1:14:10] when we go to Ephesians
[1:14:15] if let us start from Ephesians
[1:14:19] chapter 4 verse 30.
[1:14:25] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30.
[1:14:29] the scripture says
[1:14:34] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:14:37] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:14:40] redemption so
[1:14:43] much
[1:14:50] praise the name of Allah so he says he
[1:14:53] gives us the holy spirit
[1:15:00] means finished one foreign
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:43] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:15:46] glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:15:51] is
[1:16:00] in whom also
[1:16:03] you trusted
[1:16:05] after that you heard the word of Truth
[1:16:08] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:16:11] also after that you believe you were
[1:16:13] still with the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:16:16] foreign
[1:17:14] that's the scripture now the falsely
[1:17:18] anointed ones
[1:17:21] we receive the spirit
[1:17:27] let us look at it in the nature
[1:17:31] foreign
[1:19:19] so you can express the gift of the Holy
[1:19:23] Spirit
[1:19:25] without the Life of Christ
[1:19:28] foreign
[1:19:54] expressing the same gifts of the holy
[1:19:57] spirit
[1:20:02] that's not what we want
[1:20:04] praise the name of Allah so here what we
[1:20:07] want is have the words
[1:20:12] and the Holy Spirit comes in a time
[1:20:17] comes at your home
[1:20:27] they receive it
[1:20:31] in Acts chapter 8
[1:20:35] they had received the word
[1:20:39] but then when they laid hands on them
[1:20:45] the same thing in Acts chapter 10 when
[1:20:49] Peter spoke these words
[1:20:51] when Peter spoke these words
[1:20:54] they received the word and as they
[1:20:57] received their wife then the Holy Spirit
[1:21:00] that's the same principle of God
[1:21:03] praise the name of us you know it says
[1:21:07] the fruit of the spirit
[1:21:09] but where does the spirit bear is fruit
[1:21:12] the spirit Bears is true
[1:21:24] the Holy Spirit
[1:21:26] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:21:31] until the Redemption of the purchased
[1:21:34] position unto the praise of his glory
[1:21:37] where single boobs ready
[1:21:56] so he says the holy spirit
[1:21:59] is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:22:09] you know we it's declaring to us
[1:22:12] that more is yet to come
[1:22:18] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:20] Spirit
[1:22:21] it doesn't mean you don't have
[1:22:24] weaknesses
[1:22:27] that doesn't mean that
[1:22:28] let us go to Romans chapter 8.
[1:22:34] and then verse 26
[1:22:37] likewise the spirit also helps our
[1:22:41] infirmities
[1:22:43] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:22:45] as we ought but the spirit itself makes
[1:22:48] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:22:51] cannot be uttered
[1:22:56] um
[1:23:11] and he that such as the hearts knows
[1:23:14] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:23:17] it makes intercession for the sense
[1:23:19] according to the will of God
[1:23:44] reminding you of the word
[1:23:46] when you find you are going astray
[1:24:03] no you cannot live a Victorious
[1:24:06] Christian Life
[1:24:08] without the Holy Spirit you just lead
[1:24:11] the Holy Spirit
[1:24:20] when we accept the Lord
[1:24:25] and then we are filled with the Holy
[1:24:28] Spirit
[1:24:30] it is the soul that has now been
[1:24:33] redeemed
[1:24:35] but the bodies you are living in
[1:24:39] have not been changed it is the same
[1:24:43] body that is born in sins
[1:24:46] it is
[1:24:51] how you still resemble
[1:24:54] it is
[1:25:04] you are still living in the same body
[1:25:08] somebody that used to fear it is that
[1:25:11] somebody that used to be tempted
[1:25:14] that still under different Temptations
[1:25:18] so our bodies have not yet been changed
[1:25:22] but then the Soul has been changed
[1:25:26] the soul has been transformed but this
[1:25:30] body I am a village
[1:25:32] it becomes worse as you grow older
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:52] in Romans chapter 8
[1:25:58] and then verse
[1:26:01] 21.
[1:26:08] and not only a day but ourselves also
[1:26:11] which have the first fruit of the spirit
[1:26:13] even we our Sinners grown within
[1:26:17] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:26:20] wait the Redemption of our body
[1:26:23] foreign
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:27:48] as long as you are still in this bodies
[1:27:51] you'll always have weaknesses
[1:28:00] when the devil knew stand where together
[1:28:04] that Jesus wants to take over the whole
[1:28:06] world
[1:28:07] he came by that desire worship me as I
[1:28:12] give you all these guys and that's the
[1:28:15] same way
[1:28:17] but but we have got the power man defeat
[1:28:22] All The Temptations
[1:28:28] and he has given the Holy Spirit to give
[1:28:32] us the ability to empower us to live
[1:28:37] above our Witnesses
[1:28:40] so the Redemption of our foreign
[1:29:12] let us go to this message
[1:29:21] he turned them
[1:29:23] a young man the young woman
[1:29:28] why did he have to do that
[1:29:31] so they could receive the promised
[1:29:35] Sonoma and that is the next thing in
[1:29:38] order for the church
[1:29:42] we which are alive
[1:29:45] and remain to the coming of the Lord
[1:29:49] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:29:55] for we shall be changed
[1:29:58] in a moment
[1:30:01] to receive the promised son
[1:30:05] where is it going to come
[1:30:08] down here on Earth
[1:30:13] don't meet him here on us
[1:30:18] and we couldn't meet him in this kind of
[1:30:21] bodies
[1:30:25] he says we don't meet him on us
[1:30:29] you know that's the time of the rapture
[1:30:32] we don't meet him in these bodies
[1:30:36] you know but we meet him in in the
[1:30:39] bodies that have been changed
[1:30:43] we've got to be changed to meet him in
[1:30:47] the air
[1:30:50] the body will be changed in a moment
[1:30:56] and we shall be caught up together to
[1:30:58] meet the Lord
[1:31:00] praise the name of Allah
[1:31:09] they would not bear
[1:31:12] so God had to fast change their bodies
[1:31:19] God has to change our bodies
[1:31:26] when we are in the motor bodies then we
[1:31:30] shall be able to submit Christ
[1:31:35] we shall be changed
[1:31:44] we shall be changed so
[1:31:46] from this
[1:31:51] this part and then we shall meet Christ
[1:31:55] you know when Christ tonight why do
[1:31:58] crystal way Alpha the Bible says in Acts
[1:32:02] chapter 2. you went to hell yeah
[1:32:06] he went to Hell by his by ethiophany
[1:32:11] and now he preached the souls that were
[1:32:13] in prison
[1:32:18] he resurrected
[1:32:23] the body that had died
[1:32:26] and now it became a glorified body
[1:32:31] right now we are living in natural
[1:32:34] bodies
[1:32:36] but now when you leave us
[1:32:38] when you sleep when you die there is if
[1:32:43] you find anybody waiting for you
[1:32:46] that's what the scripture says II
[1:32:49] Corinthians chapter 2 Corinthians
[1:32:52] chapter 5.
[1:32:56] and then verse one
[1:32:58] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[1:33:01] this Tabernacle you're dissolved we have
[1:33:04] a building of God and house not made
[1:33:07] with hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:33:13] second Corinthians 5. second Corinthians
[1:33:27] is
[1:33:40] for in this we've grown earnestly
[1:33:42] Desiring to be closed upon with our
[1:33:44] house which is in heaven
[1:33:53] if so be
[1:33:56] so be that being closed we shall not be
[1:33:58] found naked
[1:34:06] praise the name of us
[1:34:09] the scripture is telling us
[1:34:11] when this
[1:34:29] the Bible says
[1:34:32] celestial bodies and the bodies tell us
[1:34:35] you but the glory of the celestial is
[1:34:38] one and the glory of that Celestial is
[1:34:40] another name
[1:34:52] so now as we have received
[1:34:57] the importance of companies
[1:35:07] born again
[1:35:09] we receive bodies
[1:35:24] you had to be born and born with the
[1:35:28] body of the earth
[1:35:32] we receive Heavenly Bodies
[1:35:35] now in Philippians Philippines
[1:35:46] he says for our conversation is in
[1:35:49] heaven from what we also look for the
[1:35:52] Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:54] foreign
[1:36:27] is in heaven
[1:36:30] now the question
[1:36:32] how were you how did you become a
[1:36:35] citizen here on us
[1:36:37] you had to be first born why not
[1:36:40] yourself
[1:36:53] it will be born by the by the root of
[1:36:56] God
[1:36:58] that which is born of the flesh
[1:37:03] that is
[1:37:05] born of the spirits
[1:37:28] waiting for you yeah when you die from
[1:37:31] this body
[1:37:34] in heaven
[1:37:36] in other words you just change your
[1:37:38] Dwelling Place
[1:37:47] and then the Bible says
[1:37:54] that doesn't have any weakness
[1:38:01] but in the heavenly bodies
[1:38:19] born again
[1:38:22] actually confirms that we have bodies in
[1:38:24] heaven videos
[1:38:34] the Bible tells us Bible yet to cover
[1:38:36] praise the name of us that the Lord
[1:38:39] saying
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:47] praise the name of our Lord
[1:38:58] there we go
[1:39:02] to verse 16.
[1:39:04] the Bible says
[1:39:06] for the Lord himself
[1:39:17] descend from heaven
[1:39:20] okay let us start from the back from 14.
[1:39:23] for we believe that Jesus died on the
[1:39:26] rose again
[1:39:27] even Sodom also which sleep in Jesus
[1:39:31] will God bring foreign
[1:40:04] then Christ remains in
[1:40:09] amazing people in their theophany bodies
[1:40:12] they come down here and yeah
[1:40:15] and when they get here on us they pick
[1:40:18] their bodies that were corrupted
[1:40:22] and then when they picked their birds
[1:40:25] that were corrupted
[1:41:27] it's not yet time foreign
[1:41:43] foreign
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:26] beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:42:30] and it does not yet
[1:42:32] here what we shall be but we know that
[1:42:36] when he shall appear
[1:42:39] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:42:42] him as he is
[1:43:00] and every man that has this hope in him
[1:43:04] purifies himself even as he is
[1:43:15] the name of Allah the Bible says when we
[1:43:19] see him
[1:43:21] we shall be
[1:43:34] who shall change our vile body that it
[1:43:38] may be fashioned like his glorious body
[1:43:41] according to the working whereby he is
[1:43:44] ever even to served you all things unto
[1:43:47] himself
[1:43:52] foreign
[1:44:00] foreign
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:34] but the difference is
[1:44:41] can be eaten by animals
[1:44:47] these bodies
[1:44:51] these bodies
[1:44:55] while bodies
[1:44:59] are not our inheritance
[1:45:09] now you start asking yourself
[1:45:12] how much money do you spend on this body
[1:45:16] and if you're investing in something
[1:45:18] that doesn't last
[1:45:20] sentence
[1:45:26] what the loss you're doing
[1:45:29] praise the name of our lord
[1:45:31] it's not good it's not bad to put to
[1:45:34] invest in your body
[1:45:38] are you investing rightly or not
[1:45:42] you can have lunch of 50 000.
[1:45:46] but how much are you doing for the
[1:45:48] kingdom of God
[1:46:21] it doesn't matter whether you elevate
[1:46:24] This Grass to whatever status you remain
[1:46:27] grasses
[1:46:32] you know all those countries we look at
[1:46:36] Europe America everywhere why the answer
[1:46:38] is
[1:46:49] also green yeah
[1:46:55] and they also need
[1:46:57] s
[1:46:59] even the people go to the moon
[1:47:02] the food on the moon cannot sustain them
[1:47:08] they have to pack from here
[1:47:11] these bodies
[1:47:15] it doesn't matter the status
[1:47:26] and once you the life leaves this body
[1:47:31] the most honorable thing you can do to
[1:47:33] that body is
[1:47:41] video
[1:47:43] was
[1:47:44] foreign
[1:48:17] is
[1:48:35] done with Christ then it will come and
[1:48:39] pick this
[1:48:41] corruptible body
[1:48:45] to have all become a girlfriend
[1:48:54] now let us then look at the glorified
[1:48:56] body for a short time
[1:49:00] let us go to John chapter 20.
[1:49:03] and then verse 24.
[1:49:07] but Thomas
[1:49:12] John chapter 20.
[1:49:20] verse 19.
[1:49:22] then the same day at evening being the
[1:49:25] first day of the week when the doors
[1:49:27] were shut where the disciples were
[1:49:30] assembled for fear of Jews came Jesus
[1:49:33] and stood in their midst and Saints unto
[1:49:35] them peace be unto you
[1:49:38] foreign
[1:50:11] his hands and his side then where the
[1:50:15] disciples glad when they saw the Lord
[1:50:25] is
[1:50:30] now the Bible says
[1:50:40] the disciples
[1:50:43] and then Jesus comes in their meetings
[1:50:56] and then they were glad
[1:50:58] so the body which is glorified
[1:51:02] is a higher form of bodies
[1:51:06] and these bodies
[1:51:09] these bodies we're leaving I cannot pass
[1:51:12] through a world
[1:51:16] cannot stand before they are not knocked
[1:51:19] today
[1:51:22] these bodies that we live
[1:51:27] these bodies that we're living cannot
[1:51:30] walk on the water
[1:51:31] but now the glorified body
[1:51:35] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:47] then the bodies that we're living here
[1:51:50] let us go to Luke chapter
[1:51:53] foreign
[1:52:10] foreign
[1:52:19] and it came to pass as he said to admit
[1:52:23] with them he took bread and blessed it
[1:52:25] and break it and gave to them
[1:52:36] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[1:52:40] him and he vanished out of their sight
[1:52:43] Amazon
[1:52:49] foreign
[1:53:14] body
[1:53:23] let us go to Second Kings chapter
[1:53:27] 2.
[1:53:32] second Kings chapter 2.
[1:53:36] and then we read in the
[1:53:41] Green University
[1:53:46] and it came to pass when they were gone
[1:53:48] over that Elijah said unto Elisha what
[1:53:51] shall I do for thee before I be taken
[1:53:54] away from thee and Elisha said I pray to
[1:53:57] let a double portion of thy Spirit be
[1:54:00] upon me
[1:54:04] it is
[1:54:11] foreign
[1:54:26] but if not it shall not be song Buena
[1:54:34] foreign
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:55:34] foreign
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:52] the Bible tells us when the sleeping
[1:55:56] Saints arose
[1:55:59] in Matthew chapter 27.
[1:56:02] they were seen of many people
[1:56:05] but when their time of going up to
[1:56:08] heaven came
[1:56:10] nobody saw them
[1:56:13] are you getting it
[1:56:16] even our Rapture when our bodies are
[1:56:20] changed
[1:56:23] at the time to meet Christ in the air
[1:56:26] comes
[1:56:27] the people living on us are not going to
[1:56:31] see us
[1:56:35] so it's
[1:56:37] a form of body
[1:56:39] the Bible says when Jesus yes let us go
[1:56:44] to Luke chapter
[1:56:46] 24.
[1:56:48] and then verse 50.
[1:56:54] Luke chapter 24 and then verse 15.
[1:57:01] the scripture says
[1:57:03] and he led them out as far as to Bethany
[1:57:07] and he lifted up his hands and blessed
[1:57:10] them
[1:57:17] and it came to pass while he blessed
[1:57:21] them he was spotted from them and
[1:57:24] carried up into the heaven
[1:57:30] now
[1:57:37] but brother Branham teaches about he
[1:57:39] laid captivity captive organ again
[1:57:45] when we go to Psalms 68 verse 18.
[1:57:51] Psalm 68 18.
[1:57:54] he says
[1:58:00] LED captivity captive
[1:58:09] or severe
[1:58:10] obsidable
[1:58:15] then in Psalms chapter 22 24
[1:58:19] and then verse 7. it says lift up your
[1:58:24] heads or you get and be lift up you
[1:58:27] Everlasting those and the king of glory
[1:58:30] shall come in
[1:58:32] foreign
[1:58:50] who is the king of glory the lord strong
[1:58:54] and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle
[1:58:58] yes
[1:59:06] lift you up your heads or you get even
[1:59:10] lift them up you Everlasting those and
[1:59:13] the king of glory shall come in
[1:59:22] who is this king of glory
[1:59:26] the Lord of hosts he is the king of
[1:59:29] glory
[1:59:36] praise the name of our Lord
[1:59:38] says this was now
[1:59:40] Christ foreign
[1:59:47] [Music]
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:29] soccer okay but in the message the
[2:00:32] Rapture
[2:00:34] now notice but wait again you've had
[2:00:37] three Witnesses
[2:00:41] we've already had three raptures in the
[2:00:44] Old Testament
[2:00:45] yes
[2:00:47] do you know that as a witness
[2:00:54] Elijah was the other area and Jesus was
[2:00:58] the other one yes
[2:01:05] there are three ruptures
[2:01:10] and the first Rapture of the New
[2:01:12] Testament
[2:01:14] happened for the Old Testament since
[2:01:19] when Christ took them to Heaven
[2:01:23] praise the name of Allah and then the
[2:01:26] second rapture
[2:01:28] is the rupture of the New Testaments
[2:01:32] from the time that Christ resurrected
[2:01:36] we can talk of the Apostles
[2:01:46] we are part of the second Rapture
[2:01:50] that is going to happen now the second
[2:01:54] Rapture happens
[2:01:56] but the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:09] will be in Revelations
[2:02:15] Elijah and Moses after their Ministry to
[2:02:18] the Jews
[2:02:53] so God has given us this message
[2:02:57] and the message that he has given us is
[2:03:01] a message that changes us
[2:03:03] it has the ability
[2:03:06] it is the word of God in the power of
[2:03:11] God to transform us
[2:03:13] from our weaknesses from our failures
[2:03:19] our Assurance now that these motor
[2:03:23] bodies
[2:03:27] that we have received from inside praise
[2:03:31] him Overlord we have been born again we
[2:03:35] have received the word of God you have
[2:03:37] received the spirit of God so by that
[2:03:40] transformation from within us
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:09] it was the seventh watch
[2:04:12] es
[2:04:15] when they heard the voice
[2:04:17] before the bridegroom comments
[2:04:21] and we have got the voice
[2:04:24] in the seventh watch
[2:04:38] raise up and trim your lamps
[2:05:18] let us finish
[2:05:21] 4.
[2:05:26] 16
[2:05:29] he says for the Lord himself shall
[2:05:32] descend from heaven with a shout with
[2:05:36] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[2:05:38] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[2:05:41] shall rise fast
[2:05:47] foreign
[2:05:57] foreign
[2:07:25] foreign now the third thing is a trumpet
[2:07:30] which is always the Feast of a trumpet
[2:07:35] if they're calling the people to the
[2:07:38] feast
[2:07:39] and that will be the brightest supper
[2:07:44] with the bride in the sky
[2:07:48] the first thing that comes first is his
[2:07:51] message
[2:07:53] calling the bride together
[2:07:56] the next thing is the resurrection of
[2:07:58] the sleeping
[2:08:01] the ones that died back in the other
[2:08:05] ages
[2:08:17] that's the thing that takes place
[2:08:21] we are right there
[2:08:33] you know
[2:08:36] foreign
[2:09:36] and then they will Ascend then we shall
[2:09:40] also follow them and all of us together

[2:09:47] we shall be changed

[2:09:52] amen amen we shall be changed so it
[2:09:56] doesn't matter what you're going through

[2:10:14] it doesn't matter what sickness the
[2:10:17] devil can put in this world it doesn't
