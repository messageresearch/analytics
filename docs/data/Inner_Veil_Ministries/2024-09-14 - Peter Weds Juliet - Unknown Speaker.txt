do is to bless the marriage which God has performed today precious heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank you for this marriage it is you that has performed it and whatsoever you do is blessed so we come to thank you and we just come to reemphasize the blessings that you have conferred and preferred upon these people that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray that the way and their path in this Christian marriage may be as clear as clear can be and I pray heavenly father that you may also bless them with the same blessings that you blessed the first marriage in the garden of you told them to multiply to reproduce to replenish you endure upon them all the Heavenly blessings we prefer these blessings upon them Father that you may bless brother Peter the same way you blessed Adam and bless Juliet the same way you bless the wife that you gave to Adam I pray that you handle protection may be upon this marriage that no devil whatsoever be able

bless the fruit of their Union father that you may put a supernatural light around them that whenever they go father may it be said that Behold The Blessed of the Lord thank you for them Lord and may you hold them tight together as a witness of the relationship of Christ and his church in Jesus name amen amen stand up so she's your [Music] wife come on now it's possible she's your wife no you don't put the F [Music] [Applause] again move over here she's very happy [Music] so um praise the Lord I want to take you into the teaching of the word a little bit uh to give the fundamentals of what a Christian marriage is you change the SES she's so happy oh oh be careful oh okay I want us all to stand up and we go into the study of the word a little bit The Book of Genesis chapter 5 vers 1 and two Adam was a name which belong to male and female and today drum is the name which joins husband and wife Juliet you've lost a name but now you've got a new name you are dram and she has even been saying as I said she's Dr she is also saying Dr this is the book of the generations of [Music] Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created So Adam was not only the name of the man it was the name of the male and female and after this Union the name doesn't belong to you alone now it's for male and female we us have a word of prayer pre 7ly father we thank you so much for the opportunity that we have witnessed a teaching on the relationship of Christ and his church as we saw Peter and Juliet join in this I pray that you may bless this little sharing in Jesus name amen you may be so Adam came forth as both male and female sharing the same name sharing the same body and sharing the same spirit so God made sure that Adam remained that way until maturity was established so in Genesis 2 verse1 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of to dress it and keep it so where was his wife his wife was still on the inside of it amen because in the beginning he was created in the image of God and the image of God is a spirit so Adam was a spirit being but he had his property on the inside of him and his property was it's the only wealth he had and now afterwards God saw that it was necessary to te the ground now he made Adam into the dust of the earth so he got the spirit and dressed it in a body but even as they came into the still he had his property on the side here amen God could not separate Adam and Eve until Adam had matured to the level where he could be able to hand a marriage are you together with me he couldn't let her go until Adam had grown to a level where he could marry a wife that's why I don't believe in Little Children going along around there somebody is about 17 years and the girl is 15 years they are trying to make a marriage it's not scripture God did not allow that in the case of humanity because God allowed that with they don't care you know when he created them from day one they were a husband and wife but God did not do the same when it came to humanity so God needed man to mature first to develop a man but these days you find some people that have not matured they are men they've got painted faces and they want to come and take somebody's daughter they are coming to a house they want to get married they've got all kind of shag hair and is not grown at all he doesn't show the maturity that cares for a wife he has got a balance of a TR totally responsible but he still wants to marry somebody God did not allow that he had watch for maturity that Adam I know your wife is in your side but I'm not going to allow you to become a husband to her until you have matured okay so you see God had to put Adam in Hest at first amen so that Adam needed to be productive he was tendering his garden and God came in his farm amen so is that so that Adam was now mature enough he had to check on him how did he check on the maturity of he checked on the maturity of by causing Adam to stand right there and he said Adam I'm now going to bring both these animals and see what you going to call them when the animals came he began to name them he named them but let me say it's not Adam who named them but Adam entered into the mind of God and he knew what those animals and they called them by what God would so Adam was so mature that he worked and he also thought like a [Music] God and then he says how can I leave such a man without a help me are you together with me so God needed to see how Adam would mature now what is maturity maturity is when a man begins to think like a god when Adam thought like a God God said is mature [Music] he would see the mind of God that's matur you know God has a wife and his wife is called the church and God the same way he handles the church is the same way he will desire us to handle a wife so when God wanted to teach his relationship between him and the church he chose to bring the institution of marriage so that by marriage a man would be showing what the Mind God has towards his church so that's why it is necessary that when a man is thinking of marriage to come and be part of a church be told the mind of God to think like a god to choose like a god you see the difference between man now and man then Adam he did not have a choice but you you have the choice why do you have a choice because God gives you his mind you begin to think like him you've been in a church you've been taught and then you look among the ladies I'll have mercy on whom I'll have mercy so Peter looked and had mer upon Juliet that's how God chooses us to Salvation to Salvation he says I love I love if a husband is the image of Christ he looks with the intent I have mer on whom I love and then Juliet you are privileged somebody has had mer on you 44 years ago I had M on somebody come I had Mery upon somebody [Applause] you see she has that confidence she know somebody had Mery upon her 44 years ago yes so God bless you she has cooked my food for 44 years that's why we don't get old you can go back so Peter listen you are not going in a trial there's a song which used to to say like that go back J J this is not and when you know that you are now bound you must be bound to the love of that [Music] manes every morning you put in the I know [Music] what I tell you when he gets annoyed he looks very bad so you maintain that smile so this is what God did he allowed Peter I mean Adam and he says such a man cannot stay alone I'll give him a help made for him since now women have the right to choose we choose what is meat for us show me your level maturity and I will also give you the kind of wife you deserve that was the contract between Adam and God and when Adam displayed the maturity and maturity is having the mind of God you forgive like God and when God forgives he doesn't remember our sin sometimes we look at one another like a men of Flesh and when he repented God not forgive God is not like that he forgives [Music] you that's what I want in your house just because you have the mind of God you know now this one here is the image of the church the church will always make mistakes will always fail but when the church fails there's the blood of Jes where she can go and watch she can be forgiven I don't know why people divorce because the Church of Christ once it commits a sin it is not divorced you know when she takes the the Lord Jesus and said father I pray you might have Grace upon me God says forgiven 70 * S A Day learn to forgive and jul hold that man is forgive me my my my my honey forgive me my Lord that's enough Peter you don't go into why like a god just forgive and you just repent you see when Adam married what he married was a byproduct from him and he recognized her and he said this is born of my B Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a woman because she was taken out so what you marry will always be a reflection of your inner strength all your inner weakness what you marry is a reflection of what you are on the inside if you married a figure you should not buy enough food in the house because she must St in order to M the figure because you married a figure when you buy the food she start going not the wife you see how she looks if you married a smart lady with nice clothes you made a mistake because shops I mean clothes they just buy from the shop you can get a Shabby one and you dress her to that level So Adam when he looked at Eve he says hey this is exactly me in a duplicate form she's born of my B she's Flesh of My Flesh she's Spirit of my spirit she will be called woman because she was come out of so this is why the secret of who the woman [Music] is remains silent amen but when she gets married and now you know Peter begins to love her all the other ingredients begin to come out you just love her you loved her and she says I'll marry you continue to love her she will give you children you continue to love her she'll give you good food you continue loving her she'll wash your clothes She'll always call you daring one she'll call you all kind because the switch is love when the switch changes things change maintain the love switch Peter are you listening to maintain the love s now we just talk about so now you have the trick you know she's me she's me that's why you cannot hurt your own body he that ha his wife ha his own body the Revelation she's born of my B she shall be called a woman woman meaning that which came out of the and it was so much part of him she would he would even die to protect her because it's her when anything is done to your wife is being done on you you don't like it you should be that one as Christ and the church is one Christ died to protect his church you should to protect that lady you should teach her the word of God daily because that was your maturity your maturity which took you into marriage is not because you didn't have a cook you don't marry cook you marry wife you don't marry a laundry person amen you married the wife and because she's a wife she'll give you food because she's a wife she will give you you know do your clothes so you did not marry child Factory so before anything else Juliet is your wife value her as a part of your body and God knew where to get her from if he got her from the foot he would walk over her but he brought her out of your re from the side of your heart so that your heart can love her and she I want to remind you one thing you see I'm just realizing that we came late so I should be stopping here but I want to tell you that after the fall did you hear me there's something that was dropped on Eve that heart will be after her husband that's the problem I mean Eve walked alone and met sweet talked and ate the fruit and the Earth came into this cast so after the fall God said your wife you you the lady your heart will always be after your hus because she made a mistake she could almost live without him now God says you should stop living without you feeling for your husband all the time if you are from the same body Sister Sister you'll always say Peter Peter how are you have you reach at work Peter that was a problem God dropped upon them don't start say don't you give me peace uhh that problem God dropped it to them they cannot live without you you know that even at midnight she has been calling you isn't that true and then you start saying Hey Now Juliet what does she think calling me at midnight like this that's the problem God gave a woman who is not jealous has a problem it them even he minutes are you are you near is already evening is on the table don't question why that's a problem God left for if she calls you 10 times a day be just grateful that you remained in her mind as she was leaving for Peter have you had just love her I wish we had time to talk about things this here is your greatest asset in the future of your family and you should let her to have a very good influence in your life if you let somebody else have more influence in your life then your wife you'll be in trouble allow her to own you allow her to hold that house you see these houses here we build very nice houses but these houses are for women a man can stay there maybe 3 hours a day and then goes to bed but this one here lives there all the time let her make the decision here I want this color because she's the one going to watch that and the house you are building you are building for your wife when Jesus went he said to his wife I'm going to prepare you place it is for us it's not for him so Peter when you build that house it is her house you know let her say this is where I want the pant to be this is where I want the C to be I want you to build a house and let her participate let her have an influence over your life you will have an everlasting family now we've got a man called zakas she had a wife called Rebecca but she had a very strong influence over him and she compelled Zak to go and see Jesus zakas was a very rich man he was working in the UR and he was very wealthy but she he had a wife at home he could go and SE people's [Music] businesses he could look like a very man but at home the wife had an influence you m here very tough but every time he talks about his wife even mama here you let your wife have an influence you are the only [Music] two who own your world if you allow another person to stand between you and your wife is you who suffers the div and your children suffer allow your wife to have an influence over you in the Bible we've got a very powerful judge his name was called pilot he had the power to kill Christ save him but the Bible tells his wife had an
