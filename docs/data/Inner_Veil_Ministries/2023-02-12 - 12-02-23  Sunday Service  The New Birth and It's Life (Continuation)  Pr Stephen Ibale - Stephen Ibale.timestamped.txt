[3:22] he says born by the word of God
[3:27] is
[3:35] he stepped away she didn't ever
[3:39] from the life that the word gives each
[3:43] gamble which Gaba and he stepped out of
[3:46] it yet once you step away from the world
[3:49] Robert gamble you die
[3:52] Oliver offer the only level you can be
[3:55] given life is
[3:57] to take the life behind that to us
[4:02] to come back into your position
[4:06] foreign
[4:19] by stepping out of the world from
[4:21] Chicago then take the word again
[4:24] bring you back into your position
[4:29] amen amen so look at it this way let's
[4:32] go to Joe chapter 2.
[4:37] and I will restore to you until then
[4:52] migrate under which I sent amongst
[4:58] there was a practical expression
[5:03] of what happens when you step away from
[5:07] the world
[5:09] it was in the time
[5:12] now there is what happened there
[5:16] that they are foreign
[6:14] flowing through you
[6:16] foreign
[6:47] are you together with the men one is it
[6:49] so the Palmer one uh
[6:52] [Music]
[6:59] it's away the fruit
[7:04] and all the fruit is eaten it is
[7:11] immediately it was eaten the fruit
[7:14] and it looks and there is nothing more
[7:17] to eat
[7:19] then it changes
[7:22] and changes the appetite
[7:26] and it becomes the locus
[7:34] it's not that lives away
[7:38] when it says there's no more leaves
[7:41] it changes this nature
[7:46] with the back of the tree
[7:52] completely
[7:53] and afterwards if the back is fully
[7:57] eaten away
[8:00] it changes
[8:03] and it
[8:08] begins to suck
[8:11] the life out of the back
[8:16] and when they saw it it was a complete
[8:20] dead tree
[8:22] um
[8:30] are you together with me it was dry
[8:36] but he says I'll restore

[8:51] The Love Is
[8:57] Your Peace
