[9:20] [Music]
[9:24] praise. Let us
[9:26] pray. Father, in the name of our Lord
[9:28] Jesus Christ, we thank you for this
[9:31] morning. We give praise and honor to
[9:34] your
[9:35] name for the opportunity you've given us
[9:37] to come into your
[9:39] presence. You said where two are
[9:41] gathered in your
[9:43] name, we will be there in their
[9:46] meetings. Lord, we believe you're here
[9:47] in our
[9:49] meetings. Speak to us,
[9:51] Father, the word of eternal
[9:54] life. Bless our hearts in such a
[9:58] special meet all our various needs.
[10:03] as you have
[10:04] promised. We love you Lord and we thank
[10:07] you. We give honor to your holy
[10:10] name in the name of the Lord Jesus. We
[10:12] pray and ask
[10:13] this. Amen. Amen. You may be
[10:16] seated. Amen. Amen. I greet you in the
[10:20] name of our Lord Jesus
[10:22] Christ. We thank God for those who have
[10:25] been able to come
[10:28] today. Praise the name of the Lord and
[10:31] likewise appreciate everyone who
[10:33] participated in the wedding and
[10:34] introduction of Steven and
[10:41] Victory. Praise the name of our Lord and
[10:45] so is good to be
[10:47] one to stand with one
[10:50] another. You know that's what the Bible
[10:53] says that mourn with those who
[10:56] mourn and rejoice with those who
[11:00] rejoice. Praise the name of our Lord.
[11:03] When it is rejoicing like marriages and
[11:11] graduations, let us all be one and put
[11:13] our efforts together to rejoice.
[11:18] Maybe it is sorrowfulness like death or
[11:21] funerals or
[11:24] sickness. Maybe one has been put in
[11:27] prison. We also need to do the same
[11:30] thing. If we stand with one
[11:33] another and that's what shows that we
[11:35] are a body of Jesus
[11:37] Christ. Praise the name of our
[11:40] lord. So pastor is not
[11:43] around is actually went for a funeral.
[11:49] He went to a
[11:52] funeral. Actually, that's the place
[11:54] where the funeral
[11:57] is. He lost a brother-in-law to his one
[12:00] of his eldest
[12:07] sisters. So, he was there from this
[12:11] morning and even I believe some people
[12:13] have gone there to be with him.
[12:17] And then also there's another funeral
[12:21] again lost his
[12:24] mother also the burial is today
[12:28] in the place is
[12:35] called and the funeral is starting at 1
[12:39] 100 1 p.m.
[12:42] and I'll be the one taking that funeral
[12:46] service. So I want to take maybe one and
[12:49] a half
[12:51] hours. Maybe by one we can
[12:54] leave and then said that at two we are
[12:57] there to start that funeral
[13:01] service. So you see we are quite
[13:05] divided in different kind of
[13:09] commitments. Praise the name of our
[13:11] Lord. I thank God for
[13:14] everything. Everything works out for the
[13:16] good of them that love
[13:19] God. Then next
[13:22] Sunday, you know, we meant to have the
[13:24] Lord's supper
[13:26] today. We were
[13:29] meant because we had the function
[13:33] yesterday. So we said maybe we postpone
[13:35] to the next the following
[13:39] Sunday. So on 18th
[13:42] Brother on
[13:44] 13th we are going to have the lord's
[13:46] supper
[13:47] here praise the name of our lord so we
[13:50] shall have two
[13:52] services and then the lord's supper
[13:54] starting at
[13:56] 5 so you come when you are prepared to
[13:59] expect it then we have only one
[14:03] service and then another
[14:06] announcement our brother Joshua here
[14:12] He lost one of his
[14:15] grandparents and the burri is going to
[14:17] be
[14:19] tomorrow. That's after Maga on on Ginger
[14:23] Road. I think it's place called
[14:28] Namasoga. So those be able to go there,
[14:30] it will also be
[14:32] good. Praise the name of our Lord.
[14:35] Before the reading of the
[14:36] word, invite sister Faith and the team
[14:38] to come and sing.
[15:13] God bless you. Amen.

[19:15] [Music]
[19:24] [Music]
[19:32] [Music]
[19:51] When we walk with the Lord.
[19:56] In the light of his
[19:59] word, what a
[20:02] glory shed on our
[20:09] way. While we do his good
[20:13] will, he abides with us

[25:19] Amen. Amen. Do you appreciate that?
[25:22] Trust and obey. Praise the name of our
[25:25] Lord. I just pray the Lord gives me
[25:28] grace.
[25:30] I want to talk about something simple
[25:36] yet very important in our Christian
[25:38] walk.
[25:41] Praise the name of our Lord. I've just
[25:44] been thinking how simple I can maybe
[25:46] bring it
[25:49] out such that even a little child can
[25:52] understand it.
[25:54] And I want to talk about
[25:57] obedience. Praise the name of our Lord.
[26:00] Obedience. We appreciate the brothers
[26:02] who have come in. You're
[26:04] welcome. Brother
[26:07] Prim. And all visitors in our ministry,
[26:09] you're
[26:11] welcome. Praise the name of our Lord.
[26:13] Let us stand up and have a word of
[26:15] prayer and take our scripture reading.
[26:21] Father again we thank
[26:23] you and now we've approaching the
[26:26] reading of the
[26:28] word. We pray that you may come and
[26:31] speak to us
[26:33] father the words of eternal
[26:36] life that can help us dear Lord Jesus
[26:40] Christ how we can walk before
[26:43] you that we can be accepted Lord. Help
[26:47] us father in our
[26:49] weaknesses and give us the grace
[26:52] Lord to be obedient to your
[26:55] word even when we can't understand
[26:58] it that we may only follow you
[27:01] Lord. Bless it father even to our hearts
[27:06] father that lord you may make that word
[27:11] quick powerful in our
[27:13] lives bring a transformation in
[27:16] us deliver us father from any form of
[27:25] godliness but you may give us the
[27:28] transformation
[27:30] that we may be like Christ, we love you
[27:33] and we thank
[27:34] you in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray
[27:36] and ask this.
[27:39] Amen. Amen. We go to the book of 1
[27:45] Samuel chapter 15 and verse 18 to verse
[27:53] 23. We are talking about
[27:57] obedience. Amen. Amen. And the Lord sent
[28:01] thee on a journey and said, "Go and
[28:04] utterly destroy the sinners of the
[28:07] Amalocites, and fight against them until
[28:11] they be consumed.
[28:26] Wherefore then did thou not obey the
[28:30] voice of the Lord, but did fly upon the
[28:33] spoil, and didest evil in the sight of
[28:36] the Lord.
[28:50] And Samuel and Saul said unto Samuel,
[28:53] "Yeah, I have obeyed the voice of the
[28:56] Lord, and I've gone the way which the
[28:58] Lord sent me, and I've brought a king of
[29:02] Amc, and I've utterly destroyed.
[29:22] But the people took of the spoil, sheep
[29:26] and oxen, the chief of the things which
[29:29] should have been utterly destroyed to
[29:31] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[29:33] Gilgard.
[29:53] And Samuel said, "Has the
[29:56] Lord has the Lord as great delight in
[30:00] burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in
[30:03] obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold,
[30:06] to obey is better than sacrifice, and to
[30:09] hearken than the fat of rams.
[30:32] For rebellion is as the sin of
[30:34] witchcraft and stubbornness is the
[30:37] iniquity and adultery. Because thou hast
[30:40] rejected the word of the Lord, he has
[30:42] also rejected thee from being king.
[30:58] Oxy.
[31:17] So I want to talk about
[31:20] obedience. Praise the name of our Lord.
[31:24] Obedience. You know it is very
[31:29] important in our Christian
[31:32] walk. Be
[31:34] obedient and to be
[31:37] obedient to the word of
[31:39] God. Praise the name of our Lord. To be
[31:42] obedient to the word of
[31:45] God. And you know
[31:47] obedience from the
[31:52] childhood as a
[31:54] parent you demand your children to be
[31:59] obedient and
[32:01] naturally God has put something in
[32:05] us that you are going to
[32:08] obey because the scripture says man is
[32:12] always influenced.
[32:16] There's something that influences
[32:18] you. There's something in your
[32:21] life whereby you want to look up to
[32:24] somebody
[32:26] else. You know, like even learning how
[32:29] to
[32:30] eat like a small child will always look
[32:34] to the big
[32:35] ones. or a small child who always look
[32:39] at the mother and then starts imitating
[32:42] how the mother
[32:45] speaks. No, starts to learn from the
[32:49] parents and know then there's that kind
[32:52] of bonding that
[32:55] comes and a
[32:57] child will not have any doubt in their
[33:01] parents but they will do exactly what
[33:04] their parents tell them.
[33:07] And this is where the Lord Jesus told
[33:09] us that unless we are like little
[33:14] children, we cannot see the kingdom of
[33:16] God. Because the little child will just
[33:20] do what you tell them to
[33:22] do. They don't have another
[33:26] thought. It's maybe until they've had an
[33:28] experience through
[33:30] that. Like now for
[33:33] example, praise the name of our you know
[33:35] like when you have little children at
[33:37] home you know they always want to touch
[33:41] everything they are so
[33:44] inquisitive what is this and sometimes
[33:47] when perhaps maybe when you have fire
[33:52] around they want to find out how what is
[33:55] this what is this but you know as a
[33:58] parent you just see how you can control
[34:00] them
[34:03] So now obedience is required from
[34:08] us. God requires us to be obedient to
[34:11] his
[34:13] word. You may not be able to understand
[34:15] the
[34:16] word. You may not be able to appreciate
[34:18] why you're being told
[34:21] that. But then he requires obedience.
[34:25] Praise the name of like when the Lord
[34:27] Jesus
[34:28] Christ started washing the feet of Simon
[34:32] Peter.
[34:34] Then Peter said, "Not me,
[34:37] Lord." Then the Lord told him now you
[34:41] don't know what I'm
[34:43] doing, but allow I do it and then you'll
[34:47] understand later.
[34:50] And also sometimes we are faced with
[34:52] this kind of
[34:54] scenarios. Now the Lord tells you go and
[34:56] do this and
[34:58] this. It's God who knows why you have to
[35:01] do
[35:01] that. And then you don't ask God why
[35:04] those
[35:06] kind. Now there was a general in
[35:10] Syria and now this general in
[35:13] Syria he had
[35:16] leprosy. And then when he had
[35:19] leprosy, there was a maid in his
[35:23] home who was taken from
[35:26] Israel. And then this maid told her
[35:31] mistress that you know in
[35:34] Israel there is a prophet of
[35:37] God. If my master would go to that
[35:41] prophet, he would be made whole.
[35:44] So now when the when the the wife heard
[35:47] that she told the husband, then the
[35:51] husband went and told the king and then
[35:54] the king wrote to the king in
[35:57] Israel, kill my servant of
[36:01] leprosy. And then the king started
[36:03] renting his
[36:05] clothes. He said, "This man wants to
[36:07] have an issue with me."
[36:10] And when the prophet heard, he told
[36:13] them, "Send him to
[36:15] me." Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[36:19] when Elisha
[36:22] was, maybe he expected Elisha to come
[36:25] there, bow before
[36:28] him, great
[36:30] captain. God has done a lot of victories
[36:32] with
[36:34] you. But the prophet didn't come out.
[36:38] He sent the servant he has you
[36:42] go and tell him to dip himself seven
[36:46] times in river
[36:49] Jordan. Now the the captain was
[36:52] like this man here. He didn't even come
[36:56] out to greet me again. He's telling me I
[37:01] go to the dirty river of
[37:04] Jordan. Maybe it was like n channel
[37:09] where every garbage and waste flows
[37:12] through
[37:13] to said, "But we have better rivers in
[37:17] Syria, clean
[37:19] water, better places of
[37:22] worship, better places, you know,
[37:25] furnished." But the prophet told him,
[37:29] "Go to
[37:30] Jordan." The man was so
[37:33] furious. How could he make me do such a
[37:35] thing?
[37:38] Let us go to second kings chapter
[37:41] 5. Praise the name of
[37:43] God. And then verse
[37:47] 9. So the Bible says, "So Nan came with
[37:52] his horses and with his chariot and
[37:54] stood at the door of the house of
[37:56] Elisha.
[38:04] And Elisha sent a messenger unto him,
[38:06] saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven
[38:09] times, and thy flesh shall come again to
[38:12] thee, as and thou shalt be
[38:27] clean." Praise the name of our Lord. How
[38:30] difficult was it to go to
[38:33] Jordan and dip
[38:35] yourself? For many years, the man had
[38:39] suffered with
[38:40] leprosy. Maybe he tried to use this
[38:43] lotion. He tried to use this
[38:46] treatment. All didn't
[38:48] work. Just like the other woman with a
[38:52] blood
[38:53] issue, the Bible says she had spent all
[38:56] her living
[39:01] and she was not made anything better by
[39:03] the
[39:06] physician. But then go faith got into
[39:09] her
[39:10] heart. He said if but I can touch the
[39:13] hem of his
[39:16] garment. How hard was
[39:19] that? Praise the name of our Lord. So
[39:22] you see and you know brother Brandham
[39:23] teaches
[39:24] us that God hides himself in
[39:30] simplicity things that a
[39:33] despise is where God hides
[39:36] himself and then he reveals himself in
[39:39] the
[39:40] sin and you can imagine God put that in
[39:44] brother Brham's
[39:46] heart to preach a message of God hiding
[39:50] himself in simply
[39:54] ity praise the name of our Lord and
[39:57] telling
[39:58] them we are looking at you know the
[40:00] revealing of the
[40:03] seals but then you shouldn't go
[40:06] far God hides himself in
[40:11] simplicity praise the name of our Lord
[40:13] and so now before he would preach the
[40:15] seven
[40:17] seals he had to prepare the hearts of
[40:20] the
[40:21] report. Praise the name of our Lord
[40:24] about what the Lord how the Lord handled
[40:28] things. And so he took a
[40:31] service and then he preached about God
[40:34] hiding himself in a simplest
[40:37] way on a Sunday morning
[40:41] service. Praise the name of our then the
[40:43] following day on
[40:45] Monday started the revealing of the
[40:48] seal. Praise the name of our Lord. Now
[40:51] just before we go further in that n
[40:55] issue. Brother Brandham says in the
[40:57] message a greater
[41:01] witness. He says and then those people
[41:04] look to that old
[41:07] fisherman. And you know what they did?
[41:11] If they they had have had some great
[41:14] degree to go
[41:17] by, he would have had something to glory
[41:21] in. But God took
[41:24] nothing and made something out of
[41:28] it. That is the way God
[41:32] does. Just takes
[41:34] nothing to make
[41:36] something. And when you being when you
[41:40] can become nothing in your own
[41:44] sight, you are becoming something in
[41:47] God's
[41:49] sight. And always remember this
[41:52] friends. The way
[41:55] up is
[41:57] down.
[41:59] Obedience.
[42:00] Humility. And to be
[42:03] obedient shows that you are humble.
[42:07] Praise the name of the Lord. That's an
[42:10] expression of
[42:11] humility. So he says the way
[42:14] up is down. He that exalts himself
[42:20] shall be
[42:22] ab that humbles
[42:25] himself shall be exalted.
[42:28] So just love him with all your
[42:31] heart and forget all you ever know about
[42:34] other things but Jesus
[42:38] Christ. Just go ahead and love
[42:42] him and work for him and serve him. If
[42:46] he wants you to be the
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] doat, well, you just be the
[42:56] do. It's whatever he wants you to
[43:00] do, do it. Praise the name of God
[43:05] demands obedience.
[43:08] It was not
[43:10] difficult for
[43:13] to go and dip himself in the river seven
[43:17] times. So
[43:19] simple. But say let us get back to our
[43:25] scripture where we've read in in 2 Kings
[43:29] chapter 5.
[43:34] Elisha told him, "Go and dip yourself
[43:38] seven
[43:40] times in the river and you'll be clean."
[43:45] There was an
[43:47] assurance that when you do this, you're
[43:50] going to get this something you have
[43:53] taken your whole
[43:55] lifetime without achieving
[43:57] it. Praise the name of God. And that's
[44:00] the same thing with even the Holy
[44:02] Spirit. When you obey the word of
[44:05] God, it is
[44:08] certain that the Lord fills you with the
[44:10] Holy
[44:11] Spirit. It's not
[44:13] difficult. It's not rocket
[44:16] science. It's not something that is far
[44:18] away from
[44:19] you, but it's something that's right
[44:23] before. Just obey and then the Lord will
[44:27] do what he has
[44:29] promised. Praise the name of our Lord.
[44:31] There's another quote I want to get to
[44:34] again in the message what visions
[44:40] are. Praise the name of our lord. Now
[44:43] brother Brandham says I just want to
[44:45] read a small
[44:46] portion says we are unworthy to ask
[44:50] this you know he was praying for the
[44:54] handkerchiefs and then he was quoting
[44:56] that how they took you know they took
[44:58] aprons from the body of
[45:03] Paul and then they would put on the sick
[45:05] and they would
[45:06] recover and then he said Lord we are
[45:08] doing
[45:10] this we are not St.
[45:12] Paul, but you have done
[45:15] it. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[45:17] then brother Brham explains that Paul
[45:20] was doing
[45:21] this maybe because he saw
[45:25] Elijah telling the
[45:28] servant, take this
[45:30] stuff and put on the dead
[45:33] body and we
[45:35] recover. And then brother Brham says
[45:38] because Elijah knew that whatever he
[45:42] touches is blessed. Praise the name of
[45:46] we need to be the same thing that my
[45:49] life is
[45:50] blessed. Whatever I touch is blessed.
[45:53] Whatever I say is blessed. Praise the
[45:56] name of our Lord. That shows the Lord is
[45:58] with you
[45:59] continuously. That should be our
[46:01] Christian
[46:02] life. that even at your place of work,
[46:06] somebody can have confidence in
[46:08] you and when you pray for them, they're
[46:11] going to be healed. Praise the name of
[46:14] our Lord. That shows the Lord is with
[46:17] you. Praise the name of the Lord. It's
[46:19] not something that is
[46:22] farfetched. Christian life is a reality
[46:26] in our
[46:27] lives, something that's so real to
[46:30] us. Praise the name of the Lord. So then
[46:33] he says we are unworthy to ask
[46:36] this. There is no good thing about
[46:39] us but it's
[46:42] because you have bid us to do
[46:45] it. So you are depending upon his
[46:49] word and so if you're depending upon his
[46:53] word you are obedient to
[46:55] that. Praise the name of God. Then he
[46:59] says just like the serpent on the
[47:05] pole, it says there was no
[47:08] virtue in the serpent or the
[47:12] pole. You know when the children of
[47:14] Israel were in the
[47:16] wilderness and then you know they
[47:18] rebelled against
[47:20] God and God set serpents in the
[47:23] camp and many of them were dying.
[47:27] So the Lord told Moses, "Make a brassen
[47:30] serpent, put it on a pole, and lift it
[47:34] up in the
[47:36] camp." And then he told Moses,
[47:38] "Whatsoever shall look at that breast
[47:42] serpent shall be healed." Now, brother
[47:45] Brandham is saying, Paul never had any
[47:49] power. The the serpent never had any
[47:52] power. It was just brass.
[47:56] But then where the power
[47:59] was was in
[48:01] obedience. Praise the name of it was all
[48:04] about
[48:05] obedience. So he says just like the
[48:09] serpent on the
[48:11] pole. No virtue in the
[48:14] serpent. But
[48:17] obedience is what brought
[48:21] result. Trust and obey.
[48:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Obedience
[48:27] is what brought the
[48:30] result. Obedience to the
[48:33] word. And sometimes we despise being
[48:39] obedient. Praise the name of our Lord.
[48:41] And then sometimes we despise being
[48:44] obedient to our
[48:47] parents. Sometimes we we despise being
[48:51] obedient to the council that is given to
[48:53] us.
[48:56] I know I'm going to take
[48:58] my And many times we get ourselves into
[49:03] trouble. Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:05] Like sometimes we have
[49:07] scenarios. Praise the name of our Lord.
[49:10] Like here we are a church. We are a
[49:13] family. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[49:16] then there's the leadership that the
[49:17] Lord gives us here as a local
[49:21] city. And then you come to the pastor
[49:24] and you ask him about this and he gives
[49:27] you counsel and then you debate over
[49:31] it and then you go to another one and
[49:35] ask he gives you
[49:37] another
[49:40] okay and you get yourself lost
[49:44] there this way you're picking this
[49:47] advice you're picking the
[49:50] other Gandhi Praise the name of our
[49:53] Lord. Now like here, praise the name of
[49:56] our Lord. We preach what we believe the
[49:59] word
[50:01] says. Praise the name of our Lord. Like
[50:04] there was a
[50:06] scenario. We believe the way the
[50:09] scripture
[50:11] says, praise the name of our a minister
[50:16] should marry a
[50:18] virgin. Praise the name of our God. Now,
[50:21] of course, you'll go somewhere
[50:23] else, maybe some other method church,
[50:26] and you'll be told something
[50:28] different. Ah, that one was for the Old
[50:31] Testament. But the question
[50:34] is, why did God tell
[50:38] brother when he was still
[50:40] young, don't
[50:43] smoke, don't defile yourself, don't
[50:46] drink.
[50:49] If it didn't
[50:51] matter, why did he tell him to do that?
[50:54] Don't
[50:56] foricate. Don't commit
[50:58] adultery. Don't drink. Don't smoke. It
[51:03] was for the Old Testament. Why could you
[51:05] tell him that? Proverb. He was not born
[51:08] again. He didn't know much about
[51:11] God. And whenever he tried to go beyond
[51:14] those
[51:15] bounds, then the angel of the Lord will
[51:18] come for
[51:20] Now, so somebody gets into that kind of
[51:25] dilemma. There they say this, the other
[51:28] pastor says this. I'll go with the other
[51:30] one what he
[51:32] say. You know that kind of
[51:36] debating and so you find yourself you
[51:38] are
[51:40] stuck and at the end of the day you
[51:44] can't be
[51:46] helped. And so many people get
[51:49] themselves hanging
[51:52] there. Praise the name of our Lord. He
[51:54] wants to compare what you preach
[51:57] here. The other one
[52:00] preaches. Praise the name of our Lord.
[52:03] But you see, it's about
[52:05] obedience. Elisha
[52:08] told, "Go and dip
[52:11] yourself in Jordan." Elisha had
[52:15] conviction.
[52:17] Elisha had
[52:18] certainity that when you go and deep in
[52:21] Jordan, you'll be made
[52:23] whole. And then N was
[52:28] wrothful. Why is he sending me to that
[52:30] dirty
[52:31] river? Why are they telling us this old
[52:34] time
[52:36] religion? Why are they telling us this
[52:38] kind
[52:39] of
[52:41] obedience is very important. So he says,
[52:45] let us go back to second Kings chapter
[52:49] 5 and then verse
[52:52] 11. But N was
[52:57] wroth and went
[53:00] away and said,
[53:03] behold, I
[53:05] thought he will surely come
[53:08] out to come and stand before
[53:12] me. I'm a captain. I'm a big
[53:18] person. But here you are before God.
[53:22] Be
[53:23] humble. Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:25] Allow the counsel of
[53:28] God. Praise the name of the Lord. If the
[53:30] instruction is this
[53:32] way, then why do you want to go another
[53:35] way? take soul. The instruction was go
[53:41] and destroy
[53:44] everything, all the people, all the
[53:47] animals. So now when Saul got into this
[53:51] country, he spared the
[53:55] king. He killed all the other
[53:58] people. And then when they came to the
[54:01] ship, whatever was very
[54:05] healthy, ah this one is going to
[54:07] survive. They kill those which are funny
[54:10] or looking
[54:12] bad. But then the ones which were
[54:14] attractive to
[54:15] them. We are going to save this
[54:19] one. So he brought
[54:21] everything. And then the Lord
[54:24] says, why has Saul disobeyed my wife?
[54:32] Praise the name of why as if not obeyed
[54:35] my
[54:37] voice I've sent him
[54:39] out he went and did his own
[54:45] things and then the Lord
[54:48] said he has not followed my
[54:52] commandments you know and then it
[54:54] grieved the prophet
[54:59] Obedience is very important. Praise the
[55:02] name of God. Obedience is very
[55:06] important. You know, obedience can be
[55:08] talked about in so many different
[55:11] things. Praise the name of our Lord.
[55:13] Like now we had a
[55:17] wedding and this were making
[55:20] vows in
[55:22] sickness, in good health.
[55:25] in poverty, in
[55:28] riches, and then there are trials that
[55:30] the Lord permits to check you
[55:35] people. Will you stand by your marriage
[55:41] vo? These days my husband doesn't have a
[55:44] job. So you
[55:47] separate. These days my husband is too
[55:49] sick.
[55:52] So you
[55:53] separate. Ah, my wife doesn't give
[55:56] birth. Let me look for an
[55:59] alternative. You're not obedient to the
[56:02] voice. But you committed yourself into
[56:06] it
[56:08] obedience. So now Saul, he was made a
[56:12] king by
[56:13] God. So he had to obey the one who gave
[56:16] him that leadership.
[56:21] And Saul went and did these other
[56:24] things. And then
[56:26] Samuel told him, you know, you were
[56:30] picked up and told to do
[56:33] this. Why did you reject the voice of
[56:37] God? Praise the name of the Lord. So it
[56:40] said something with
[56:42] N was
[56:44] angrier. This man should have come to
[56:48] me and salute
[56:51] me. Oh, captain, you're a great man. But
[56:55] the man has
[56:57] leprosy. He's a
[56:59] sinner. Leprosy stands for
[57:05] sin. And it needs the blood of Jesus
[57:08] Christ.
[57:10] The same thing with us, our leprosy. let
[57:13] us bring it in and dip it in the blood
[57:15] of
[57:16] Jesus and we shall be made
[57:20] whole but you say no I I don't think I
[57:23] should do that kind of
[57:26] thingy
[57:27] remains the sin
[57:30] remains praise the name of now so n was
[57:34] very
[57:36] rough and said I thought we come and
[57:39] stand call on the name of his
[57:42] lord strike his hand over the
[57:45] place and recover the
[57:47] leprosy. That was his
[57:49] mind. But when you come to
[57:51] God, don't come with your
[57:55] alternative. I have this option. I have
[57:58] this alternative. I have this
[58:00] alternative. Let us not be like
[58:04] Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[58:06] know Lot when the angels went into
[58:10] Sodom, the angel told him, "Run to the
[58:16] mountain." Lot as an
[58:19] alternative, "No, my master. No my lord,
[58:23] let me go to this
[58:25] city." The man was bound by city
[58:29] life. Bound by that kind of condition.
[58:33] Moreover, the cities he wanted to go to,
[58:36] they also under judgment. The angel is
[58:39] telling him, "Run to the mountain." He's
[58:42] saying, "No, I want to stay
[58:45] alive." Lord,
[58:48] Lord, until the angel said, "Okay,
[58:52] go." And then he told them, "But as you
[58:54] are going, don't look
[58:57] back." Ah. And then the wife said, "Ah,
[59:00] the things I have there." She
[59:03] turned. Pill of
[59:06] salt. She
[59:09] disobeyed. She was still being taken up
[59:12] by the things she has
[59:15] left. She had an
[59:18] alternative. But then when we come to
[59:21] the Lord, let us be obedient to the
[59:25] word. Praise the name of the Lord. The
[59:28] Lord has told us, let us cut off
[59:31] deceit. Let us cut ourselves
[59:33] off. If the word of God tells us, don't
[59:37] associate with wrong
[59:41] company. Say they are my
[59:44] friends. I like them. There is a danger
[59:47] coming along the
[59:49] way. Something is
[59:52] coming. Praise the name of our Lord.
[59:54] Like there's a scripture I read
[59:55] yesterday in the morning
[59:58] exaltation. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:01] I believe we can pick it
[1:00:04] up. It's in the book of 2
[1:00:09] Coronicles. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:00:12] 2
[1:00:14] Coronicles chapter
[1:00:19] 25 and then verse seven.
[1:00:32] I believe each of us I don't know those
[1:00:35] who are on WhatsApp WhatsApp. Praise the
[1:00:38] name of the Lord. We we have a church
[1:00:43] forum whereby every
[1:00:46] morning we have a daily
[1:00:50] exaltation. in the morning for about 10
[1:00:53] to 20 minutes or
[1:00:55] 25. Take your
[1:00:58] time and be participating in
[1:01:01] this. Be listening to these things and
[1:01:04] it will help your spiritual life
[1:01:08] daily. Praise the name of you know there
[1:01:11] are so many things that the Lord speaks
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:14] us that will help us overcome our
[1:01:17] weakness.
[1:01:20] So take
[1:01:21] interest. Praise the name of Allah. If
[1:01:24] you are not on that
[1:01:27] forum, you can at least maybe get in
[1:01:30] touch with
[1:01:31] us. You can either contact brother
[1:01:34] Wilson giving them your
[1:01:37] details actually. I hope is an
[1:01:39] administrator
[1:01:41] and I think William is also an
[1:01:42] administrator administrator so that you
[1:01:45] can be part of the church
[1:01:47] group and take your time and listen to
[1:01:51] them. Take your time listen to them to
[1:01:54] help you. Now if the Lord is telling
[1:01:58] you don't be company with wrong
[1:02:02] companies. I know they are my friends. I
[1:02:05] love them. They are good.
[1:02:07] But the Bible is telling
[1:02:09] you don't be equally yolked to
[1:02:13] unbelievers. And now your best friend is
[1:02:15] an
[1:02:18] unbeliever. Your best counselors and
[1:02:22] unbelievers you are in the trouble here
[1:02:25] now. Then he
[1:02:26] says to wait with the old children of
[1:02:32] Ephraim. But if thou will
[1:02:35] go, see, he's saying, okay, you can make
[1:02:38] a
[1:02:39] decision. You can make a decision of
[1:02:42] rebelling. You can make a decision of
[1:02:44] dis of not of doing what the Lord has
[1:02:49] saying. Be ready for the
[1:02:53] results. That's the thing. He said, "But
[1:02:57] if you
[1:02:58] go be strong for the
[1:03:02] battle, God shall make you fall before
[1:03:05] the
[1:03:08] enemy. For God has the power to
[1:03:13] help and to cast
[1:03:17] down." So obedience is very important.
[1:03:23] When the Lord tells us
[1:03:26] something, let us be obedient to what
[1:03:29] the Lord is
[1:03:32] saying. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:35] That is where we can be blessed of the
[1:03:39] Lord. When we obedient to his
[1:03:42] word. So was
[1:03:45] Roth. Why didn't this man
[1:03:49] come? Praise the name of our Lord. Let
[1:03:51] us go back to that scripture.
[1:03:56] Second Kings chapter
[1:04:00] 5 and then verse
[1:04:05] 12 he says are not
[1:04:09] Abna and Pa rivers of Damascus better
[1:04:13] than all the waters of Israel? May I not
[1:04:16] wash in them and be clean? So he turned
[1:04:20] and went away in rage.
[1:04:40] He went away. He went with his
[1:04:45] leprosy. Can you imagine how pride can
[1:04:47] makes people miss things of God?
[1:04:51] I
[1:04:53] cannot but it's for your
[1:04:56] good. Praise the name of the Lord. It's
[1:04:58] for your good. They are telling you
[1:05:01] this. Say, "No, I'm not going to do
[1:05:04] it." And so you get stuck in
[1:05:08] illustration and then you find that
[1:05:10] something is affecting you
[1:05:14] continuously,
[1:05:16] you draining you. Why do you want to
[1:05:19] reach being
[1:05:22] bedridden? That's when you remember to
[1:05:24] be
[1:05:24] obedient. You don't need to reach that
[1:05:27] level. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:05:29] don't need to reach that
[1:05:31] level whereby the situations become
[1:05:34] worse. The damage is
[1:05:38] big. And you know there are some
[1:05:40] damages beyond
[1:05:43] repair. There are some damages beyond
[1:05:45] repair.
[1:05:49] So don't get yourself in that kind of
[1:05:52] situation with damage beyond
[1:05:55] repair. Of course you may be
[1:05:58] forgiven but you may not be
[1:06:04] justified. It remains you did it. It
[1:06:08] gets stuck in
[1:06:09] you. It actually kind of sometimes you
[1:06:14] know offends you.
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:21] But you have been
[1:06:22] forgiven. But the thing you have done
[1:06:25] still haunts
[1:06:27] you. Don't allow to go beyond damage,
[1:06:31] repair that you find it, you know, I
[1:06:34] don't know, I can do
[1:06:37] this. Praise the name of our Lord. You
[1:06:39] know, like the Bible
[1:06:41] says, a man goes out with a neighbor's
[1:06:45] wife
[1:06:47] He's burning his
[1:06:49] chest. It is some reproach you can't get
[1:06:52] rid
[1:06:54] of. Praise the name of the Lord. Even
[1:06:57] now our young
[1:06:59] sisters. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:07:02] It's messing up your
[1:07:04] life. Don't allow to involve yourself
[1:07:08] with any man.
[1:07:15] and you're not
[1:07:17] married. It is something that you damage
[1:07:21] yourself. You are forgiven.
[1:07:24] But that
[1:07:27] act praise the name of the Lord. So you
[1:07:30] don't allow to go
[1:07:32] beyond. Then they tell you don't be
[1:07:34] equally yked with
[1:07:36] unbeliever. Ah they are my best
[1:07:39] friend. or maybe a married
[1:07:42] person. You are closer to another man
[1:07:44] than your
[1:07:47] husband. You are closer to another woman
[1:07:49] than your
[1:07:52] wife. There's something
[1:07:54] wrong. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:07:57] we need to see that we don't allow the
[1:08:00] devil to take a hold of our
[1:08:03] lives. Praise the name of our Lord. So
[1:08:07] here God told
[1:08:11] If you go with that
[1:08:13] company, if you do contrary to the word
[1:08:15] of
[1:08:17] God, be ready. Be
[1:08:19] strong. But know that the Lord can cast
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:24] down. He can help you when you obey. But
[1:08:29] when you don't obey, say, "Okay, you
[1:08:32] take your
[1:08:34] course." Praise the name of Jesus. We
[1:08:37] need to be obedient.
[1:08:39] Praise the name of Lord.
[1:08:42] So he went away
[1:08:45] furious. Now what they are telling
[1:08:48] me, praise the name of there was a
[1:08:52] brother and then he was telling the
[1:08:54] sister, you know, he went and told the
[1:08:57] sister. So she called and then the other
[1:09:01] one told her. So she called and then the
[1:09:05] other one told her, "If you're going to
[1:09:08] the
[1:09:09] pastor, don't tell him about me and
[1:09:14] you." And so when she came in, she
[1:09:17] didn't say anything. That's where the
[1:09:20] problem
[1:09:20] was speaking half
[1:09:27] truth but others they avoid
[1:09:31] it and at the end of the
[1:09:33] day this one even leaves the
[1:09:38] message
[1:09:41] damage very
[1:09:44] dangerous if somebody is telling
[1:09:47] you I don't
[1:09:50] Why would they want you? Don't don't Why
[1:09:52] would somebody stop you from going to
[1:09:53] the
[1:09:55] pastor? Don't associate with the pastor.
[1:09:58] Don't tell him
[1:10:00] anything. And then fire keeps on
[1:10:02] burning, something keeps on growing. It
[1:10:05] brings
[1:10:06] destruction. Very dangerous
[1:10:09] conditions. But because of being
[1:10:15] disobedient, you don't want to obey. You
[1:10:18] have taken a certain
[1:10:20] company and then they take your mind,
[1:10:23] take your feelings, take your thoughts
[1:10:27] and you can't no more hear the
[1:10:28] word, you don't hear any
[1:10:32] advice. Maybe when you you get yourself
[1:10:34] stuck
[1:10:35] there, then now you start calling back.
[1:10:39] Let me try to go back. And sometimes you
[1:10:43] hear nothing much can be
[1:10:45] done. And maybe you can say may God give
[1:10:49] you the
[1:10:52] grace. Praise the name of sometimes
[1:10:55] those things are
[1:10:57] hard. You've got yourself messed
[1:11:00] up. You just say, "Well, God has
[1:11:05] grace. Just depend upon the Lord.
[1:11:09] We need to be obedient to the
[1:11:11] word and not having you know
[1:11:15] channels
[1:11:17] alternatives. If pastor tells me
[1:11:19] this, I'll go somewhere
[1:11:22] else. These ones they will tell me this.
[1:11:25] But even the other thing I'm not enough.
[1:11:29] I can do my decision
[1:11:32] fine
[1:11:33] decision. But the leprosy
[1:11:36] remained
[1:11:39] until actually the servants of Nan told
[1:11:43] him in verse 13. And these servants came
[1:11:48] near and spoke unto him and said, "My
[1:11:53] father, if the prophet had b thee do
[1:11:56] some great
[1:12:01] thing, would you not have done it?
[1:12:05] How much rather
[1:12:08] dain when he says to
[1:12:11] thee wash and be
[1:12:16] clean be obedient and you see the good
[1:12:20] results. They canled
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] him. It's simple.
[1:12:28] Praise the name of Lord. Then he went
[1:12:32] down and he dipped himself seven times
[1:12:35] in
[1:12:36] Jordan according to the saying of the
[1:12:39] man of
[1:12:42] God. And his flesh came again like unto
[1:12:46] the flesh of a little
[1:12:51] child, and he was clean. Praise the name
[1:12:55] of Lord. The results of obedience
[1:12:59] Just
[1:12:59] obey. It's so
[1:13:02] difficult. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:05] The Lord is not asking for something too
[1:13:08] hard, but is something that is before
[1:13:12] us. You know what the Bible says. Let us
[1:13:15] go to Romans chapter
[1:13:17] 10. Praise the name of our Lord. Romans
[1:13:21] chapter
[1:13:23] 10. And then we read in verse I believe
[1:13:27] verse six.
[1:13:32] But the righteousness of
[1:13:37] faith speaketh on this
[1:13:40] wise, say not in your
[1:13:43] heart, who shall ascend into
[1:13:47] heaven, that is to bring
[1:13:50] Christ from
[1:13:53] above. Oh, who shall descend into the
[1:13:59] deep, that is to bring up Christ again
[1:14:02] from the
[1:14:05] dead. But what say
[1:14:08] it? The word is near
[1:14:12] you, even in thy mouth, and in thy
[1:14:16] heart. And that is the word of
[1:14:20] faith which we preach. Be obedient to
[1:14:25] it. It's not
[1:14:27] far. Praise the name of the Lord. So
[1:14:30] near. Be
[1:14:32] obedient. The word says be obedient to
[1:14:34] your
[1:14:36] parents. Be obedient to your
[1:14:38] parents. Even when your parents are not
[1:14:42] believers. They don't know better than
[1:14:44] you know.
[1:14:46] Your parents maybe they are not
[1:14:51] educated but they don't understand our
[1:14:54] our our technology the modern
[1:14:57] life. They are your
[1:14:59] parents. If your mother is a
[1:15:03] witch or your mother is a
[1:15:05] prostitute she's your
[1:15:07] mother respect as your
[1:15:10] parent. If your father is a a
[1:15:14] murderer, your father is a
[1:15:16] robber, he is your father, give him your
[1:15:20] respect as your
[1:15:21] father. What we tell you, don't do the
[1:15:24] evil things he
[1:15:25] does, but he's still your father. He's
[1:15:29] still your
[1:15:30] mother. Like now, Noah
[1:15:33] drunk and you know, he undressed
[1:15:37] himself, but it was foolishness.
[1:15:41] for him to go and laugh at his
[1:15:47] neighbor. He made a mistake. The father
[1:15:51] made something which is not
[1:15:53] good. But it's not for you to start
[1:15:55] going against your
[1:15:57] father, shaming him all
[1:16:00] over. Praise the name of our Lord. I
[1:16:03] don't believe you'll be happy even to
[1:16:04] talk about
[1:16:06] it. You just say, "Lord, have mercy upon
[1:16:08] my father. have upon my
[1:16:11] mother. Praise the name of
[1:16:13] God. So one thing
[1:16:16] is when the Bible says obey your
[1:16:20] parents, obey them. Then the Bible says
[1:16:24] obey your
[1:16:25] masters. Don't say my master is not a
[1:16:29] believer. You only want to obey those
[1:16:31] who are believers.
[1:16:34] The Bible says give them the
[1:16:37] respect be
[1:16:39] obedient. You see that obedience is
[1:16:41] required
[1:16:44] everywhere. At our homes, we need
[1:16:46] obedience. At our places of work, we
[1:16:48] need obedience. At school, we need
[1:16:51] obedience. Even at church, we need
[1:16:53] obedience. And amongst
[1:16:55] ourselves, it's also
[1:16:58] required. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:01] So let us go to Deuteronomy chapter
[1:17:04] 30 and then verse
[1:17:07] 12. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:10] Deuterontormy chapter
[1:17:15] 30 verse 12.
[1:17:20] The scripture
[1:17:23] says, okay, let us start from verse 11.
[1:17:27] For this commandment which I command you
[1:17:29] this
[1:17:32] day is not hidden from
[1:17:43] you. Neither is it far
[1:17:47] off. That's what he's saying before you
[1:17:51] easy.
[1:17:53] It is not in
[1:17:55] heaven that you should say, who shall go
[1:17:58] up to
[1:18:00] heaven for
[1:18:02] us and bring it unto us that we may hear
[1:18:09] it to do
[1:18:13] it. You know, there are some people
[1:18:16] unless I say vision from the
[1:18:19] Lord, I'm not going to do it. Unless I
[1:18:22] hear the voice of God and do it. Now the
[1:18:25] Bible is telling you it's not there.
[1:18:28] It's before you. And the scriptures say
[1:18:31] in Romans chapter 10 and then verse
[1:18:35] 78, the word of
[1:18:37] faith which we preach. It's before us.
[1:18:41] What to
[1:18:42] obey? What we are meant to obey has been
[1:18:46] given to
[1:18:47] us. Praise the name of our Lord. And
[1:18:50] then he says, Neither is it beyond the
[1:18:52] sea.
[1:18:54] That you should say, you shall go over
[1:18:57] the sea for
[1:19:04] us and bring it unto
[1:19:07] us that we may hear it and do it. But
[1:19:12] the word is very near to
[1:19:17] you in your
[1:19:19] mouth in your
[1:19:21] heart. Though may do
[1:19:25] it very near before
[1:19:27] us. What does it want?
[1:19:31] Obedience. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:19:33] Obedience to the word of
[1:19:35] God. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:19:38] John chapter 13 and verse 15,
[1:19:45] He says, "For I have given you an
[1:19:48] example that you should do as I have
[1:19:51] done to you.
[1:20:02] Verily I say unto you, the servant is no
[1:20:06] greater than his Lord, neither he that
[1:20:08] is sent greater than he that sent
[1:20:17] him. If you know these
[1:20:20] things, happy are
[1:20:23] you if you do them. You know them, do
[1:20:28] them. Be obedient. Praise the name of
[1:20:31] the Lord. It's not difficult. And let me
[1:20:34] tell you, when you are
[1:20:36] obedient, you'll get the peace of
[1:20:39] God. You have the peace. I have done
[1:20:43] what the Lord wanted me to
[1:20:45] do. And it will rejoice your
[1:20:48] heart, to give you
[1:20:50] strength, to give you joy. Praise the
[1:20:53] name of Lord. I obeyed what the Lord has
[1:20:57] told. Praise the name of Lord. I'll
[1:20:59] avoid bad
[1:21:01] companies. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:21:04] I will avoid filthy
[1:21:10] programs. Praise the name of the Lord. I
[1:21:13] will
[1:21:13] avoid spending all my time on Tik
[1:21:18] Tok funny
[1:21:21] things. You are getting evil spirits.
[1:21:25] I'll avoid spending all my
[1:21:27] time on Facebook on funny
[1:21:31] movies. Obedience,
[1:21:33] you're protecting
[1:21:35] yourself. Praise the name of Lord. I'll
[1:21:38] avoid I'll
[1:21:40] stop spending all my
[1:21:42] time things that are not right and I'll
[1:21:46] put my time into the things that pertain
[1:21:48] to the
[1:21:50] kingdom. And then you'll start reaping
[1:21:52] the benefits.
[1:21:54] Praise the name of our Lord. I'll
[1:21:57] avoid praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:00] Coming to church on Sunday as a
[1:22:02] Christian, but I go to place of work as
[1:22:05] an
[1:22:07] unbeliever. I'll stop
[1:22:09] that. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:13] Obedience. In other words, let me walk
[1:22:16] the word of
[1:22:18] God. Let me do everything according to
[1:22:21] the word of God.
[1:22:24] Not really just based on something
[1:22:27] different, but let me do everything
[1:22:29] according to the plans of the
[1:22:32] Lord. Praise the name of being
[1:22:35] obedient that you know you avoid
[1:22:38] things that are contrary to the word of
[1:22:42] God. You know the word of
[1:22:45] God is for our
[1:22:47] good. Praise the name of the word of God
[1:22:50] is for our good.
[1:22:52] And then the Bible says it's not
[1:22:56] grievious. It bring you
[1:22:58] joy. Praise the name of the Lord. So you
[1:23:01] avoid things that are
[1:23:04] contrary. Praise the name of our avoid
[1:23:07] company with
[1:23:09] nonbeliever. Why would I
[1:23:15] feed from somebody who doesn't believe
[1:23:17] the message of the hour?
[1:23:22] Praise the name of our Lord. We have a
[1:23:24] lunch hour
[1:23:26] fellowship. Then you put on some FM
[1:23:35] there. We have the message
[1:23:38] tap feed on those
[1:23:44] steps. People have
[1:23:47] power generation we are in. They are
[1:23:51] blind
[1:23:57] through but there is no
[1:24:02] power. Take it. I take
[1:24:06] it. I take the name Jesus Christ. If you
[1:24:09] want a miracle, obey the word of God and
[1:24:13] the miracle will come. Praise the name
[1:24:15] of God. Obey the word of God.
[1:24:21] But you know we have some kind of false
[1:24:26] comfort motivational
[1:24:32] preachers. The spirit rose
[1:24:36] up. We have the message of the hour.
[1:24:40] Take time and listen to the
[1:24:41] message. Take time and read the Bible
[1:24:44] through being a transformation in your
[1:24:46] life.
[1:24:48] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:24:50] the Bible says we are living in
[1:24:52] perilious
[1:24:54] times. Dangerous
[1:24:57] times. You need to be careful what you
[1:25:00] feed. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:25:03] know there was a prophet called
[1:25:05] Jeremiah and he went and gave a
[1:25:08] prophecy. 70
[1:25:10] years you in Babylon
[1:25:14] captivity. They even took the things of
[1:25:16] the
[1:25:19] temple. Now what what
[1:25:23] happened? They organized all the people
[1:25:25] of
[1:25:27] Israel and then they brought the princes
[1:25:31] there. Then they brought the priests
[1:25:33] there and all the people and they were
[1:25:36] in the
[1:25:38] temple. And then the prophet Haniah
[1:25:41] came said, "Thus says the Lord.
[1:25:45] two years in Babylon and you'll come
[1:25:48] back.
[1:25:50] That was a good message to the
[1:25:54] people because the other man said 70
[1:25:58] years. This one saying two
[1:26:00] years. Which side would you
[1:26:03] go? Let us cast
[1:26:07] lost is the best
[1:26:11] now. And
[1:26:13] people
[1:26:15] goed speaking in
[1:26:18] tongues. Ah, what a great
[1:26:21] prophecy. Then they called
[1:26:23] Jeremiah. He said,
[1:26:26] "Amen." But he said, "But you is what
[1:26:28] the Lord
[1:26:29] said." And Jeremiah had a yoke of
[1:26:35] wood and Haniah came to prove that God
[1:26:39] had given him prophets of two
[1:26:41] years. He got the yoke of
[1:26:44] wood which Jeremiah had and broke it.
[1:26:50] The seven years are not
[1:26:51] there only two years. Everybody was
[1:26:55] rejoicing. Oh, we have been encouraged.
[1:26:58] My aunt who went, "Oh, I know she's
[1:27:01] going to come. My uncle who went to
[1:27:05] come through
[1:27:12] says, let us go to Jeremiah 28.
[1:27:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Jeremiah
[1:27:21] chapter 28.
[1:27:24] And then we read that
[1:27:33] story verse one. And it came to pass the
[1:27:36] same year in the beginning of the reign
[1:27:38] of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the
[1:27:40] fourth year, and in the fifth month,
[1:27:43] that Haniah, the son of Usuza the
[1:27:44] prophet, which was of Gibon, spoke unto
[1:27:47] me in the house of the Lord, in the
[1:27:49] presence of the priests and all the
[1:27:51] people, saying,
[1:28:23] Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God
[1:28:26] of Israel, saying, I have broken the
[1:28:28] yoke of the king of Babylon.
[1:28:37] Within two years will I bring again into
[1:28:40] this place all the vessels of the Lord.
[1:29:01] and carried them to
[1:29:03] Babylon. And I'll bring again to this
[1:29:07] place, the son of
[1:29:13] Johah with all the captives of
[1:29:17] Judah that went into
[1:29:20] Babylon, says the Lord, I'll break the
[1:29:23] yoke of Babylon.
[1:29:28] Tooth
[1:29:30] preacher, good
[1:29:32] message. Then verse 10, then Haniah the
[1:29:38] prophet took the yoke from off the
[1:29:40] prophet Jeremiah's neck and broke
[1:29:46] it. And spoke in the presence of all the
[1:29:53] people, saying, "Thus says the
[1:29:56] Lord, even so will I break the yoke of
[1:29:59] Nebuchadnezzar, king of
[1:30:06] Babylon, from the neck of all the
[1:30:08] nations within the space of two full
[1:30:14] years." And prophet Jeremiah went his
[1:30:21] way. Those
[1:30:25] preachers not based on the
[1:30:27] word, not based on the revealed word of
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:31] day. What can excite
[1:30:33] you? I felt nice. You're living in sin.
[1:30:38] You go into the presence of God and you
[1:30:40] have no
[1:30:41] conviction. Something wrong.
[1:30:45] The word of the Lord came unto
[1:30:47] Jeremiah verse 12. The prophet after the
[1:30:52] prophet had broken the yoke from off the
[1:30:54] neck of prophet Jeremiah saying,
[1:31:07] Go and tell her saying, "Thus says the
[1:31:14] Lord, you have broken the yolks of
[1:31:18] wood, but you shall make for them the
[1:31:22] yolks of iron."
[1:31:30] Iron.
[1:31:31] What is it?
[1:31:33] upgrading the
[1:31:35] punishment. So when you hear s
[1:31:40] preachers, taking you away from the word
[1:31:43] of
[1:31:44] God, they are hardening your
[1:31:47] heart. Praise the name of Lord, they are
[1:31:50] hardening your
[1:31:51] heart
[1:31:53] until the Bible says seed with a hot
[1:31:58] iron.
[1:32:05] You know that that one can is as hard as
[1:32:08] Pharaoh is
[1:32:14] hard regardless of what Moses was
[1:32:17] doing. He just kept on hardening
[1:32:20] himself, hardening himself, hardening
[1:32:23] himself. And the Lord kept on upgrading
[1:32:25] the
[1:32:27] punishment. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:32:30] starts at this level. This man refuses.
[1:32:33] He goes further. He refuses. He goes
[1:32:35] further. He refuses. He goes further.
[1:32:38] Then he said, "Now it's now
[1:32:41] death." The firstborn
[1:32:44] died. But he didn't need to lose his
[1:32:46] firstborn
[1:32:51] child. He needed to be
[1:32:54] obedient at the beginning. Let my people
[1:32:57] go.
[1:32:59] God let them
[1:33:00] go for 400 years. Let them go. But he
[1:33:06] refused. And then when the firstborns
[1:33:09] were
[1:33:10] killed, when the children were going,
[1:33:13] "Ah, let us follow
[1:33:15] them." Followed hardened
[1:33:19] heart. When they went into the Red Sea
[1:33:25] dry and they were drowned.
[1:33:29] hardiness of heart because of
[1:33:32] rebellion. God is telling
[1:33:35] Jeremiah
[1:33:36] tell you break this yoke of
[1:33:41] iron. So the condition was upgraded to
[1:33:44] be
[1:33:47] harder because of
[1:33:50] rebellion. So we shouldn't be
[1:33:52] disobedient to the word of
[1:33:54] God. We should not be rebellious to the
[1:33:56] word of God.
[1:33:58] We get ourselves into more
[1:34:01] bondage. You get yourself further into
[1:34:05] bondage when you're disobedient to the
[1:34:07] word.
[1:34:09] So now the Bible says in verse
[1:34:12] 14, he says, "For thus says the Lord of
[1:34:17] hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a
[1:34:21] yoke of
[1:34:25] iron upon the neck of all these
[1:34:29] nations that they may serve
[1:34:31] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.
[1:34:35] shall serve
[1:34:36] him given him the beast of the
[1:34:40] field. Then said the prophet
[1:34:45] Jeremiah the prophet here
[1:34:49] now, "The Lord has not sent
[1:34:53] you, but you have spoken to these people
[1:34:56] to trust in a
[1:35:00] lie. Anything contrary to the message of
[1:35:03] the
[1:35:05] hour is a
[1:35:07] lie. Don't put your faith in
[1:35:09] it. Don't follow it. Praise the name of
[1:35:13] our Lord. We have the standard from God.
[1:35:16] And that's the message of the hour.
[1:35:18] Stand firm with the message of the
[1:35:21] hour. Contrary to the message of the
[1:35:25] hour, put it aside. Otherwise, it
[1:35:28] increases. It puts you more in bondage.
[1:35:33] When you rebel against the
[1:35:36] messenger, praise the name of God. Then
[1:35:38] he says, "Therefore, thus says the Lord,
[1:35:43] behold, I will cast thee off from the
[1:35:45] face of the earth this
[1:35:49] year. You shall
[1:35:52] die because you have taught
[1:35:57] rebellion against the Lord." So if it is
[1:36:00] contrary to the
[1:36:02] message, it is
[1:36:05] rebellion. But why would you go? Why
[1:36:07] would you be
[1:36:09] rebellious? Why? Why wouldn't you want
[1:36:11] to be
[1:36:13] disobedient to the word of
[1:36:15] God? And you know the Bible has told us
[1:36:18] it's not far from
[1:36:20] us. We have the
[1:36:22] word. Praise the name of like now have
[1:36:26] smartphones.
[1:36:28] Many people have this
[1:36:29] smartphone. On this phone
[1:36:32] here, you can have the whole council of
[1:36:34] God on
[1:36:37] it. You have the message of the
[1:36:40] hour. Praise the name of like I have all
[1:36:43] the message on
[1:36:45] this in written
[1:36:48] form and even audio. All of it is
[1:36:52] here. But if you can find time and ask
[1:36:55] brother Se
[1:36:58] because he has been a librarian of the
[1:37:00] church for many
[1:37:04] years. He will go and show
[1:37:07] you what all the message was
[1:37:11] like those
[1:37:13] years one
[1:37:15] message. You have many
[1:37:19] tips to have the whole message books.
[1:37:22] All all the what brother Brandham
[1:37:26] preached. You needed maybe a full car
[1:37:28] with many
[1:37:32] boxes. But see how God has brought
[1:37:36] it to be just here on the
[1:37:39] phone. But the devil has also give you
[1:37:41] an alternative.
[1:37:44] Tik Tok. Tik Tok. Facebook Facebook
[1:37:46] WhatsApp WhatsApp Twitter Twitter
[1:37:49] Instagram Instagram is it linket linket
[1:37:52] truth media truth media
[1:37:55] now that is social media social media
[1:37:58] but now there's also
[1:38:00] television there's something Cyrus
[1:38:03] talked about
[1:38:04] yesterday no on Friday and I'd never
[1:38:07] heard about
[1:38:08] it he said those days there were
[1:38:13] televisions when you were
[1:38:15] The picture is clear. When you go near
[1:38:18] to it, you see boxes, boxes, boxes. You
[1:38:22] know, like people are teaching who are
[1:38:23] being taught fine
[1:38:25] art, they first draw
[1:38:27] boxes. Then they try to measure the
[1:38:30] figure they want to
[1:38:31] do. This dot and now this face is like
[1:38:35] this. Then the eye will be in this
[1:38:38] box. And then in technology they call
[1:38:40] them I think it pixels.
[1:38:44] Now he was telling us that nowadays
[1:38:47] there are
[1:38:48] televisions
[1:38:49] 4K I didn't know about that when your
[1:38:53] fight is
[1:38:54] clear when you reach it it's
[1:38:57] clear so we can have like now you got
[1:39:00] somebody
[1:39:01] sitting is having a TV as big as this
[1:39:05] wall but the man is in a sitting
[1:39:08] room. What is
[1:39:14] this? Just
[1:39:16] that. Then you start
[1:39:20] wondering spend all the night
[1:39:23] there,
[1:39:25] there. But we have all the council of
[1:39:28] God on
[1:39:29] here. Take most of the time
[1:39:32] on. And God will deliver you from
[1:39:36] rebellious
[1:39:37] spirits, from enticing spirits, from
[1:39:40] contrary things. Praise the name of God.
[1:39:44] So you see
[1:39:45] Hana to
[1:39:48] rebellion. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:39:50] But we need to be obedient to the word
[1:39:52] of
[1:39:53] God. Praise the name of our Lord. This
[1:39:56] how I can wind
[1:39:58] up. Praise the name of the Lord. Now in
[1:40:01] the message the pat
[1:40:05] Abraham he says and in thy
[1:40:09] seat shall all the nations of the earth
[1:40:12] be
[1:40:15] blessed because you have obeyed my
[1:40:19] voice. Then brotherham says what a
[1:40:24] promise because of obedience.
[1:40:28] Obedience is what God
[1:40:32] wants. It was once
[1:40:34] said, "Obedience is better than
[1:40:38] sacrifice. To obey the Lord is better
[1:40:42] than any
[1:40:44] sacrifice that you could do." Praise the
[1:40:47] name of Lord. We are called to be
[1:40:49] obedient.
[1:40:51] Be obedient to the
[1:40:53] word even sometimes when it seems it is
[1:40:56] hard. Be obedient to the word. Praise
[1:41:00] the name of our why would you want to
[1:41:01] take
[1:41:03] corners
[1:41:05] alternatives be obedient to the word of
[1:41:08] God. And then brotherham says, "And when
[1:41:12] God expects you to do a special
[1:41:16] thing, it demands a complete separation
[1:41:19] from any
[1:41:22] doubt. You've got to come to full
[1:41:27] obedience. To obey what he
[1:41:30] says, God demands
[1:41:33] it. You can't do it no other way.
[1:41:38] Praise the name of God demands
[1:41:42] obedience. Praise the name of Let us
[1:41:45] speak the scriptures and then we
[1:41:48] close. There are many things I couldn't
[1:41:50] reach
[1:41:51] today but I believe God has given us
[1:41:55] something to go
[1:41:57] with. Amen. Amen. It says in Psalms
[1:42:02] 119 and then verse 159
[1:42:09] I beheld the
[1:42:11] transgressors and was grieved because
[1:42:15] they kept not thy
[1:42:17] word. Psalms 119 verse
[1:42:32] 158. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:42:35] need to keep the word of God. Be
[1:42:37] obedient to the word. Sometimes you may
[1:42:40] not understand it. Be
[1:42:43] obedient
[1:42:45] like how can this be? Be obedient. If he
[1:42:50] has said it, follow it. And when the
[1:42:54] Lord tells us
[1:42:56] anything, just be obedient. I will give
[1:42:59] you the ability to perform
[1:43:01] it. He gives us the grace. Praise the
[1:43:04] name of John 15 and verse
[1:43:08] 9. He says, "As the father has loved
[1:43:14] me, so have I loved
[1:43:17] you, continue ye in my
[1:43:21] love. If you keep my
[1:43:25] commandments, you shall abide in my
[1:43:28] love, even as I kept my father's
[1:43:31] commandments.
[1:43:34] and abide in his
[1:43:36] love. So when you obey the word of
[1:43:39] God, abide in his
[1:43:41] love, obedience will bring the love of
[1:43:45] God. Praise the name of you want God to
[1:43:48] love you. Be obedient to his word.
[1:43:52] Follow what the word is telling you
[1:43:54] to abide in his
[1:43:56] word. Then he says in verse 11, "Things
[1:44:00] have I spoken unto you,
[1:44:03] that my
[1:44:04] joy might remain in
[1:44:07] you and that your
[1:44:09] joy might be full.
[1:44:12] How? Be obedient to the word of
[1:44:15] God. The joy of God will
[1:44:17] be the joy of the Lord will be
[1:44:20] full and the Bible says the joy of the
[1:44:23] Lord is my
[1:44:26] strength. Be obedient to the word. Then
[1:44:29] he says,
[1:44:31] "This is my commandment that you love
[1:44:34] one another as I have loved you. Greater
[1:44:38] love has no man than
[1:44:43] this that a man should lay down his life
[1:44:46] for his
[1:44:48] friends. You are my
[1:44:53] friends. If you do whatsoever I command
[1:44:57] you,
[1:44:59] Friendship with
[1:45:00] Jesus. How does it come?
[1:45:03] Obedience. Be obedient to the word of
[1:45:06] God. Be a friend of
[1:45:08] God. Abraham was called a friend of
[1:45:12] God. Because he obeyed the word of God.
[1:45:15] Obey the voice of God. Even sometimes in
[1:45:18] the midst that you find the thing is not
[1:45:22] applicable, be obeyed. We are called to
[1:45:26] obedience.
[1:45:27] Praise the name of God. You want to be a
[1:45:30] friend of
[1:45:30] God, be obedient to the word. You want
[1:45:34] to abide in the love of God, obedience
[1:45:36] to the word of God. You want to be full
[1:45:38] full of joy of God. Be obedient to the
[1:45:41] word of God. You want to see results in
[1:45:44] your life. Be obedient to the word of
[1:45:46] God. Everything is tied on
[1:45:50] obedience. Be
[1:45:52] obedient. That's all.
[1:45:55] N's
[1:45:57] recovery was based on
[1:45:59] obedience. Be
[1:46:01] obedient. Don't be
[1:46:04] rebellious. Don't be with a stony
[1:46:07] heart. Don't be with a stubborn
[1:46:10] spirit. But be obedient to the word of
[1:46:13] God. And then you will see the grace of
[1:46:15] God that will come in your
[1:46:17] life. You see the grace of God that will
[1:46:20] come in your
[1:46:21] family. You see the grace of God that
[1:46:23] will come at your place.
[1:46:26] because you found
[1:46:28] favor before the Lord obedient to the
[1:46:32] word of
[1:46:33] God. Praise the name of we actually when
[1:46:36] we
[1:46:37] stray when we are not obeying the word
[1:46:40] of
[1:46:40] God. You'll get a lot of
[1:46:44] troubles. You'll get a lot of
[1:46:47] obstacles. You'll be
[1:46:50] entangled. So many things entangle you.
[1:46:54] The thing entangles you entangle you
[1:46:57] entangle you because you're not
[1:46:59] obedient. Praise the name of God. But we
[1:47:02] need to be obedient to the word of
[1:47:04] God. Amen. May God bless
[1:47:07] you. Amen.
[1:47:10] Amen. Let us sing the song as the song
[1:47:13] leader comes.
[1:47:16] There's an
[1:47:18] arrangement that for the
[1:47:21] funeral to go to the two
[1:47:24] barriers that's
[1:47:26] from then again
[1:47:30] to 20,000 instead of
[1:47:35] 12,000. Praise the name of our lord. So
[1:47:38] let us sing this song as the song reader
[1:47:42] comes and I want us to take time and
[1:47:46] pray. Amen.
[1:47:53] Amen. Okay. Okay. Brother David is
[1:47:56] saying that the roots have been
[1:48:00] separated. Praise the name. But we shall
[1:48:02] get all the details
[1:48:04] outside. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:48:07] Let us sing that song. I shall not be
[1:48:11] moved. Praise the name of the Lord. When
[1:48:14] I'm obedient to the word of
[1:48:16] God, I shall not be
[1:48:19] moved. Amen. Amen. Psalm
[1:48:23] 61. Let us stand
[1:48:26] up. Jesus is
[1:48:30] my shall not be moved.
[1:48:35] In his love and
[1:48:37] favor, I shall not be just like a
[1:48:43] tree that's planted by the
[1:48:49] water. I shall not
[1:48:54] be Oh, I shall not
[1:48:59] be
[1:49:00] shall be. I shall not be more.
[1:49:06] I shall not
[1:49:12] [Music]
[1:49:13] be a tree that's planted by
[1:49:18] thou or
[1:49:21] die. I shall
[1:49:25] not in my Christ abiding.
[1:49:30] I shall not be
[1:49:33] whole. In his love I'm
[1:49:40] hiding. Just like the
[1:49:43] tree that's planted by
[1:49:46] the
[1:49:49] water. Th shall lord me. If I trust him
[1:49:56] ever,
[1:49:58] I shall not
[1:50:01] be he will fail me never.
[1:50:07] I shall not be just like the
[1:50:11] tree as planted by
[1:50:15] the
[1:50:18] wood. I shall know thee. I shall
[1:50:26] know. I shall not
[1:50:30] be. I shall
[1:50:34] know. I shall not be just
[1:50:40] like planted by the world.
[1:50:48] I shall not be born is what I'm
[1:50:55] feeling. I shall not
[1:50:59] be is the one that's
[1:51:03] leading. I shall not be just like the
[1:51:09] tree that's planted by
[1:51:12] the water.
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:17] I shall know the glory.
[1:51:24] Hallelujah. I shall

[2:00:34] In reverence, you start to speak to
[2:00:36] him. Dear Lord Jesus
[2:00:38] Christ, indeed Lord
[2:00:41] God, your word is two-edged sword.
[2:00:45] Father, the father, it discerns, Lord
[2:00:48] God, even to the intent of the heart.
[2:00:51] Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you, Father,
[2:00:54] for the cleansing power, Lord. We thank
[2:00:57] you father for the word Lord Jesus which
[2:01:00] speaks better words Lord. Not the words
[2:01:03] of condemnation Jesus. Not the words
[2:01:06] father of Lord
[2:01:08] God making us down down Lord but Lord
[2:01:12] Jesus the words Lord full of
[2:01:15] chastisement. The words full of rebuke
[2:01:19] Lord because Lord Jesus to you Lord God
[2:01:22] we are children and children Lord they
[2:01:26] are subject Father to rebuke. Children
[2:01:29] are subject Father to chastisement Lord.
[2:01:32] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[2:01:34] that hand of grace. Lord, the arm of
[2:01:37] love, Lord, you've given unto us, Lord
[2:01:39] Jesus, this afternoon, Lord. We go back,
[2:01:42] Lord Jesus Christ, crying, Lord, that
[2:01:46] Lord Jesus, may you reach our areas of
[2:01:48] need. May you reach our areas of
[2:01:51] wickedness. Lord, may you reach, Father,
[2:01:53] our areas, Lord, where we need support,
[2:01:56] where we need you, Lord God, every time
[2:01:59] we walk, Lord. Father Jesus Christ,
[2:02:02] whether Lord God, at night, Lord, at
[2:02:05] home, whether Lord Jesus, at places of
[2:02:08] work, whether Lord Jesus, at church,
[2:02:10] Lord, we need you, Lord God, to walk
[2:02:13] with us, Lord, to be father, Lord,
[2:02:16] obedient to thy word. Speak my Lord,
[2:02:19] speak my Lord, oh Jesus, our ears, Lord,
[2:02:23] a widely open Father, Lord Jesus. And we
[2:02:26] pray Lord having heard Lord what what
[2:02:29] says what th that says the Lord is. We
[2:02:32] pray Lord Jesus may you come and anoint
[2:02:35] Father Lord Jesus the word may you come
[2:02:38] and anoint Lord the preacher Lord Father
[2:02:41] Lord Jesus what he has taught us Lord
[2:02:44] that Lord in obedience we may go back
[2:02:46] Father doing what father the scriptures
[2:02:50] says. Oh God, I commit father, Lord
[2:02:53] Jesus, your children, Lord, the weak,
[2:02:55] Lord, Father, to your hands that the
[2:02:58] hands of love may mold them again. The
[2:03:01] hands of love may uphold them, Lord.
[2:03:04] Father, Lord Jesus, as the prophet says
[2:03:07] that those children are in the hands of
[2:03:09] God, and the Holy Spirit is watering
[2:03:11] them, that none may backs sleep. Oh, I
[2:03:15] pray father Lord Jesus, may the spirit
[2:03:17] of God guide your children. May the
[2:03:20] spirit of God bring comfort to your
[2:03:22] children. May the spirit of God stay
[2:03:25] with your children forever. Because
[2:03:27] Lord, you know the way. And Lord Jesus,
[2:03:30] your word, Lord, tells us who you are.
[2:03:33] And father, without your spirit, we
[2:03:35] cannot discern the things of God.
[2:03:37] Because the things of God are understood
[2:03:40] by the spirit of God. Therefore, Lord
[2:03:43] Jesus, we thank you for the guidance,
[2:03:45] Lord of the Holy Spirit. We thank you

[2:05:08] Lord your word in our hearts by the
[2:05:11] spirit of God that the intent is Lord
[2:05:14] that we may weep in the world. Lord, we

[2:05:19] Lord, may you lead us, Lord, as Lord
[2:05:22] Jesus, we travel, Lord God, uh to the

[2:05:32] Jesus, those who have lost their beloved
[2:05:35] ones, Lord. And as we go, Lord, may we

[2:05:46] spirit of comfort, Lord, that they may
[2:05:48] no more, Father, Lord, be grieved,
[2:05:50] Father, but let them rejoice, Lord, at
[2:05:53] the presence of the spirit of God, not
[2:05:55] considering the dead, but they may
[2:05:58] consider the Christ who is living, Lord.

[2:07:43] way, remember when I'm down on my
[2:07:48] knees,
[2:07:50] Lord. Oh Lord, remember me.
[2:07:57] Life can have so many
[2:08:01] crossroads. I find myself
[2:08:05] sometimes that I'm standing at
[2:08:10] sea in Pharaoh's bearing
[2:08:14] down. I have no god to free a cross, but
[2:08:20] I raise this stuff of
[2:08:23] faith. And I cry out, "Lord, remember me
[2:08:32] when I'm down in the valley." Lord,
[2:08:37] remember when I'm losing my way. Lord,
[2:08:41] remember when I'm down on my knees.
[2:08:45] is
[2:08:47] Lord. Oh Lord,
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:54] remember sometimes I take the wrong road
[2:08:59] and I let the devil
[2:09:03] know that when you cut my
[2:09:07] hair, I'm as powerless as any man.
[2:09:12] And like some s in the
[2:09:16] due. I'm blinded and
[2:09:20] scared. But I still cry out
[2:09:25] for me.
[2:09:29] When I'm down in the valley, Lord, when
[2:09:34] I'm losing my way, Lord, when I'm down
[2:09:40] on my knees,
[2:09:45] Lord, remember me
[2:09:51] like h in the temple. Lord
[2:09:55] like you bless me. Lord remember you
[2:09:59] remember like Joseph in a forest all
[2:10:03] this
[2:10:05] land. Oh Lord remember
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:11] me like the three Hebrew children. Lord
[2:10:16] remember like Daniel in the dead of our
[2:10:19] life. Lord, you never
[2:10:22] pray in
[2:10:28] God's
[2:10:32] remember when I'm young in the valley.
