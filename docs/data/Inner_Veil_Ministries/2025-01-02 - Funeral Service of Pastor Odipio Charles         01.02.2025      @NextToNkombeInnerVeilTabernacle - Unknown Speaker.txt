especially I remember remember him in many things could he was a man to give out everything that he had who was not for money and brought him something wi he the money would ask it's not just somebody who picks the man and put in the realiz he has no appetite for money I just want to read a quote from the prophet as CL second Corinthians 5 verse 1 quoting from this still go malice you are in the spirit land with that reflect back here but if you are all your all innermost being has become cleansed it shows what you have got a body out waiting has been also cleansed and ped why reflecting back

not pretend as a young man he labored for this gospel there is no way for you for us toore that and the reason why God will bless him is because of his labor in the bard of the Lord so I looked at I looked at brother GP he started ping at the age of around there you getting it and some of you who are here can testify that it is out of him some Churches up you know fulltime pastorship means a lot means a lot of commitment I was told that one brother was saying brother the house was like a market let me tell you Brothers it's very difficult to keep people in your house they sleep in your

some of the Pioneers message in Uganda I visited after hearing him for number of times we welcomed he preached for us uh since sincerely he didn't leave us the same as he found us from that time we had a close relationship with him friendship with him I didn't know but that was the beginning for my daughter to in the family of brother because after his departure we remain in communication in friendship and Pastor way influenced me for that right Spirit which was around him he had a right attitude he loved God and he loved the which is really not easy time came that he loved my daughter he said the Lord who led him the daughter was still in school but he said that he Faith l that he really uh God was leading him to this daughter don't decide for people who are getting in marriage uh during the of these people when Elijah was taking my daughter I had at least contributed 50% because Pastor really influenced if we can extend a little bit behind it's like our shade is moving the other side Pastors in this tent if we can move at the back a little bit start from the back because the shade is moving the other side already the Pastors in front here are beginning to feel the light yeah the heat I understood that given the of thisor I knew my daughter was going in the right hands and that's what it was amen unfortunate didn't last because of the suffering has been going through but has really been a amen if you could sit with Pastor the time you you spend with him you could feel that you just out of a service you could leave that place KN that have been service amen agre and I'm also challenged to ulate praise God I want to wind up as I request the family ofor right from my in-law Elijah Mama r and the entire family please be closer to me to us because I'm also a parent

his ability to speak while he was right at the ppit but God gave us Grace he caled down but in the next one which was still around 2017 were holding joint meetings they were visiting ministers from Ghana I think and then again while he was giving his appreciation remarks again heed out and we had to pick him wisely by God's grace let anyone know among those who are in the congregation and then later when the ministers who are there then for them they knew he's fine but for us we knew he's not fine so when they insisted and went with him to Rock [Music] Hotel I told them no man is unw he looked well they IGN Our advice but I followed on and then to show them he was not well I picked a note of 50,000 shs from his pocket and I asked himor how much is this and he told me 1 so we quickly picked him from there with Elijah his first born and we took him home that time the ones who are with him the ministers must have remained grumbling but we are trying to keep that away from hoping that he's going to get well so that went on during baptism so when he became [Music] free now he would call feel that coming that blackout he would say get me brother so and so to take me home yeah so

we want to thank God for this time where all most of Old Timers are here so I welcome you I salute you Servants of the Lord you are welcome thank you honoring this occasion this is V Emmanuel minister in church and I take the opportunity to welcome you as a brother-in-law to the late Pastor I remember when Pastor was taking my sister Ruth 1982 uh when I went to hand over Ruth to Charles I was in my short short praise the Lord and I remember I was in that short pair of short and I gave out my sister to Pastor diio I don't know whether it was who I don't remember and I remember I think we took a a photo either in the it was a brother knows better we were like a basketball field because it was all cement girls and the sun was too much I not really open my eyes well that is when I gave out my sister to the late Pastor it was May 1982 and sister Ruth uh is a daughter to our mom pris who is a retired nurse from hospital and his dad was asp asp James Patrick I mean John Patrick VI John Patrick so sister Ruth sister Ruth from the day he she married she never came back home with luggages that the husband just her so from that day when she saw that she will be with him to the last and indeed she has made the vow sister Ruth sister thank you for being a good wife in that you have stayed with your husband to thank you very much we want to sister brother has left us with six children four boys and two girls and he has left grandchild children four of them so we don't want to say we are morning brother but we want to Cate brother because he has left footsteps on the SS of time and brother indeed has been a time Minister who have been traveling in many places together with Pastor when they came back I remember Pastor I giving us a testimony that when they reached the border of Z and Uganda they were they had put on their ties and courts anding on theorder they were told to put on T-shirts because the way they were dressed it was only for his Excellence the other side so when he came back home said Daddy why have you dressed a t-shirt there was almost being fire there so we thank you men of God for the TRS you went through has been in Toro and he has a home there but because he's been a fulltime Minister it would be very hard to have two homes and the time when he plan to have a home is when he fell sick because I remember I think three times looking for land for him to construct because he had told me that he's coming old so he wanted a country home leave other for the children but then he could not make it because of the sickness so we want to thank God for the family for the support you have done to bring us to this place praise the Lord the little you have put in has brought us to this place we want to thank for the mission work because the mission work is what almost led us this place maybe if this church was not there we wouldn't know there was land in this area so it is missionary work that brought this church here which has brought the family here thank God that we are not laying the body of brother Charles here and live the reason why we brought the barrier to today is that we wanted to have some time to do some construction so we have a house in construction [Music] already praise the Lord the house is we just want to put on the beam next week we are going to roof it's not that maybe didn't care he really but you know the life of a minister you never sit with money you can even borrow to help a Believer you borrow in the house there is demand for Fe and the rest you go and help the unless you are not a cold Minister just how to eat from the sheep and you don't give back but we for brother he has with his ministers do some study about prophet and prophet Samuel they were permanent or fulltime ministers [Music] but the home was not there stud about that so because we want to appreciate everyone inde all your support since the brother Charles fell sick all your prayers and finances we want to appreciate thank you for

this marget I'm the Third born to her I'm the Third born to her because I'm the last born these are wives these are children but I think it's a long time cousin and Son [Music] brother okay God bless you because these are children I just want to make a brief introduction and a background of our late brother because I know it's a sorrowful moment at this material moment because he has left a very big gap both to the biological families and also the in-laws and also the grandchildren just briefly Pastor was born from West in in 19550 50 s and uh briefly he started his primary education in but how did he come to our with our late mother reu uh they were missionaries my dad was AER in Protestant church and first letter second letter and third letter but how did he come to B because because Char started from buo and he was born from West in Village zbo District that is our cestal home we have a very big family and others migrated Ino including our tribes so the people of our tribe in requested the Das to write to West to appoint a preacher a missionary to come too to preach in the local language and the vote landed on my dad and they gave him a letter that Mr Gideon you are being sent B to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ he said I am not going too send him the second letter when Jonah refused to go to n whated to him he had the answer he told the wife please let us go you know what happened to Jonah and they crossed through Lake Albert to and started preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the religion of protestant church it's from there that Charles oio started his primary level education and they came with it is fromo that where I was born also my sister was born there we three children were born Ino one died so CH started from the up p7 and when he completed his primary living examination he passed high grade one he was admitted in cabala [Music] S I don't know it is unfortunate or fortunately his was replaced by a rich man's son by that time our second born I can say is the first born from a dad he was already working in t Hospital as a clerical officer he said now I'm going to take you you stud from here it's from where he was admitted in Rock High where he studed his education and completed during his period in that school it's why he believed this message and he was preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ right away he started preaching the gospel seriously in class outside moving his Bible our brother here was transferred to KAG and he told the let us go to KAG say no I have got my people here I can't get lost I let me stay in t you go to KAG so he remained in T and that's why he started preaching and uh many people have given testimonies about him and I wanted to also tell you one thing our mommy died when he died Charles told me personally that he prayed to God where did you take our mom he was already a believer in the message and God told him that your mom is waiting you in the Eastern Gate he said what is Easter gate and God revealed him the Eastern Gate the place of the rightous people and your is waiting you in the instant Gates they have met in the right place another great thing he has done in our in the ministry in our family when our dad Gideon visited him in he believed the message so our daddy died after believing the message he was baptized by pastors white men and when he went back to Village the protest says you are lost he said no I'm not lost I have received something in myself I'm the one benefiting it you who has not received you're not benefiting amen so I also like to serve God that when he was he became a pastor here in Toro I managed to visit him also it's from where I met Pastor MAA who also participated in in my salvation because he stayed long at the home of the pastor and I met him there and busy preaching to me and I was touched I was already police officer but later shortly enough I told the pastors that now I want to get saved within two days there was a brother called there was one who baptized me was a Bame he baptized me in Riv going to and the water was very dir he asked me only one question do you understand water baptism I said yes because I've been having first services in the same church they knew what baptism is I say I believe and he baptized me in that water so I never mind is dir much water and I went back to my C when my life was totally changed which I've never experienced before so I like to appreciate on behalf of this family uh to appreciate all those who participated in our our late brother he has been also a very good friend of mine and most of time Consulting him and some of the information he gave me I may not deliver it here but he had a plan and I appreciate God that he married the best woman in the world and I saw the fruit and uh she has been good to us very good can welcome visitors and how he was persistently taking care of our brother so that what has touched me also very much and uh he has a home that is that is a home in t where has built a permanent house that was his first plan the first plan is bought a plot in Toro build it in a way ofas and then he was having to build a main one I was present when he were giving the planning that house is there but he had a second plan to come to this Village and he told me we me and my families we want to build in this Village so that all my children will be coming here and that one becomes a business house that but I think now because of the sickness and I I didn't follow it much because I have to be very say about it but I have to appreciate our first the first of for the driving him taking to hospital checking the the temperature pressure all the time for the evil that the wife [Music] and I want to summarize by saying this uh on behalf of the families who are touched you know uh we are two things we are message Believers and you know things of culture are quite different from the message but uh I believe that we shall have a family meeting just as a family later maybe after these programs we shall have a meeting discuss about it I'd like to thank Pastor I for the effort that he has done with his families all the inlaws the friends all pastors consing our de brother for the evil that they have done lastly but not least I appreciate our mama for being uh a good lady for keeping our brother in the last moment we heard all testimonies of what God has decided that he should go and rest even now even if you tell him back he said no I'm not coming back but I pray that let him be an example to both families including the children the orphans including us here the families because he was a lovely brother our dad was also a man of families he could have many people in welcoming everyone not even mind whether is which tribe he a man who loves everyone I used to be surprised for that some of the characters come from our dad and I've never seen my dad beating my mom and this made not even to slap or annoy my wife or to beat her I say I must be an example so I thank everyone may God richly bless you for all this effort I believe this is the perfect love of God that has make the Excellence of this program may God richly bless you um thank you [Music] um thank you very much I want to call Dr [Music] Moses Dres brother um I want to give them three minutes to give us the doctors's [Music] report and then few announcements then we have pies from their [Music] children and Mom and then we shall hand over [Music] to at Le for all the time that our dear Pastor was [Music] brother Dr Moses and brother Isaac walked with him the journey so I want to give them 3 minutes just to give us a [Music] report praise God so um we know that uh our dear pastor had been ill for some time and the main issue being that his kidneys were not really work so before he had been receiving uh what we call dialysis like an artificial kidney that would do the work for him at least twice a week um but the disease is always progressing so by the time he got admitted to I think on Friday at that time he wasn't doing well and the pressures were quite low but from the test that we had done with the of brothery specialist that seen [Music] him the toxins were very high and uh they were making the heart not to work well so it needed a bit of support time to theive but he also needed to have dialis urgently and thealis that he needed at that time was not the type that he had been getting before so at least uh were able to talk to some of the people and we had already planned to have a the dialis because it needed to take a much longer time and we also needed to First give him some medicine to support the which we had started but everything was still hanging in Balance we really thank God that uh at least for whatever we needed when we requested the people at the hospital tried to make sure that it's available so but unfortunately that evening after starting all the treatments while we were preparing to let him have theing toxin just kept accumulating and the pressures were really low so on Monday in the night um he was not able to make it UNT it was um very difficult uh but we really thank God for the teams that were available um and especially the medical team at [Music] Mulo because they were very helpful they made sure that we have whatever it is that we requested for whatever and when we took the body to to the mer [Music] when we took the body to the um they were also able to ensure that we have whatever we needed without giving us time requested us to tell them what we wanted and they made sure that so we really thank God that at least in terms of the care that we needed or that we could give at that point in time were able to access even though it was not as easy to ex but all you know we thank God for the opportunity specifically gave to us to stand in with our De le have personally known him ever since I was a little child very good friend to my father I remember he's the one who actually preached the laston when my father was being laid to rest so we really thank God at least he gave us the opportunity May rest inace um thank you for that report but I wanted you to explain it a bit clearly yes when you say somebody may think our pastor was poisoned oh so let me explain I'm I'm a nsman I'm not a scientist but I've studied conflict sensitive communication now when you eat or drink God has designed that there are systems in your body absorb what is useful and what is useless you it or you [Music] it systems fail to separate the two what if it remains in your body it becomes the English call it toxins but this side called it poison it BEC poison for the they've me got it correct I wanted to be affirmed before I want us to just appreciate this [Applause] Brothers I I told them I know why they are this size you know we also stayed five months in M last year run like I don't know they made sure all the test they take care we not paid for they made sure on Saturday I don't know how many kilometers as you guys were right emercy when they said this test but we thank you very much for your sacrifice brother Isaac whenever blood was needed whether it was midnight I don't know his networks but blood appears even when they tell you it's not in the black Bo some [Music] we thank you very much our prayers may God bless [Music] you this is from gra Tabernacle uh the pastor

thank you very much I would like to invite the children um to speak um let by Elijah come together [Music] [Music] It is Well it Is Well with My Soul it is well it is well it Is Well with My Soul God bless you I want to thank you for uh appearing here and having to send our dad and I know I'm not the only one to speak because Dad was not having only one child but I give just a brief hint you know that is expense for dialis is quite quite a d i mean quite expensive on a normal on a normal session or [Music] situation you could need about 500,000 a week now that is if he doesn't fall sick or or other things if if you're not ke on but on a normal session you will need about 500 every week so it was quite a hustle to get that money but we had very many supportive Brethren around and I would like to give special thanks to I would also like to thank Pastor I don't know whether he's around here and also and and Believers around for example when we're in t you know diis centers are not in so when D would get sick for maybe a particular issue Believers would come in and also since I'm online I also want to give special thanks to brother mang of Canada and Pastor god of who are very supportive in other this this exp can't be managed by one single person even if you're outside the country kind of collective and you know in terms of flow of cash especially if it is coming from out and you want the answers now you'll be in a mess so that's the brief history about it and including other issues of uh of dad he was an example to the family to me is a okay I don't want to put him in the place of God I know God is my rock but after him I was always looking at that very when when when he when he knows something is the truth no no power of hell can di him from it and that is the Legacy that I hope to push forward hence I know when Satan when when Jesus died on the cross you know all hell was celebrating they think they thought everything was over but Jesus had a stinger missile within no time hell was quaking so he may be lying there and you think things are just there but there are seeds everywhere and there is more determination to bring down the Gates of [Applause] Hell God bless you thank you for coming i' would like to thank everyone for whatever support you've done for my family financial spiritual reward you all in your various capacities I'd like to thank God for the life of my dad dad was our Rock was God fast and I've tried to also instill that in my children God first I thank my brother Elijah so so so much no one knows what my brother has

question how does uh Christian behave and then I started watching the life of my father Baba and my mom and yes I saw I saw something I really saw Jesus and yes I gave my life to Christ on theas that

long way there many of us have learned a lot from him he has been examplary to all of us has been a friend and a mentor the most important thing is that I learned a lot of him he was preaching a lot so some things we don't get because he used to bring in many ministers and preach so but there are some things I learned from him about Simplicity he preached about Simplicity it's not about be having nothing but it's about being humble so some I reflected on some of the thoughts he used to talk to us every night he taught us to pray and he also talked about one of his sermons all his well so when you reflect on that you see no matter what happens or doesn't happen all is well yes so we are thankful for his life and there's nothing we learned I was in another district and he was Ina I was

you brother J and the speckled we appreciate you so much thank you for coming to our a and then the rest of the groups that have been coming in you were not late so we appreciate all of you and I want to say a few words about brother Charles you see when the gospel came uh we know we had Jerusalem where the Holy Spirit came F the 120 and uh the gospel was preached that same day thousands were preached yeah thousands were baptized and we appreciate God for Jerusalem but then there are some other places like Antiochus which had a totally different beginning which had nothing to do with Jerusalem Jerusalem here is T College brother God bless you so much you have been an icon of Faith you are the first Pastor in the country which we can call the Jerusalem of faith and I would want also to say brother I could relate him to I mean to Antioch they had nothing to do with Jerusalem but still it was the same faith and from brother he baptized me I knew him when he was putting on shorts and sand he me to the Lord amen I appreciate that man I baptized brother Ben one of the very first converts and the three of us we became a trinity as the people desired to call us and so we appreciate God for the way he used our brother he Tau me one thing that in the gospel we are not on competition everybody has his own call he taught me to be very humble when you are handling the word he told me I don't have a heaven where I take the people the people must be taken to the word the word to perfect them prepare them for a heaven that's general for all of us so you don't cut off a piece and say these are my people those are my people we are one b in Christ saved by the same gospel filled by the same Holy Spirit must be filled with the same kind of spirit that brought this message to us amen humble humility having a soft Spirit when we are preaching we are not making War to anybody no we are trying to do the best we can bring the people to the Lord that was the man that I knew he was known by a sweet Spirit he would look at you um brother St I think that one will live to the Lord I've always learned to live it to the Lord you never hear many battles when they throw I don't throw back I've learned from Brother Charles amen so he had the ability to call somebody who didn't believe him a friend you see there's no reason why we call names it's not necessary even when Judas came to kill Christ Jesus stand and says friend why have you come that was I just want to say one thing that one time as I don't want to spend time here we went to Congo it was me brother brother and the late so we're preaching from Ronda into Cong then somebody would I preached in Randa then I moved into brother had preached in came back into chali brother and they had preached in I mean a place inur and then I was going to move from there go to buk but you know brother Ben who is here somewhere amen he was with brother waswa they had been invited to go to place I believe it was bkav is that right so there was a c they were using and they reached a bridge and the car just fell there was nothing it's like something pushed the car and now when they brought it back up it would move but brother Ben says no we go back so they went back then they said we are not going to sleep another night they came to G I was still having series to preach and then says stop we have to go so we came and then we reached brother was still having brother says no we must go now and we decided we were obedient and then when we crossed theing Randa that same day and so immediately the forces came and they asked where are the ugandans who have been here and the one that would have been there was brother Charles but we thank God that God put a cover upon his life and he was able to preach more years until he rests now I want to appreciate my sister- inw sister Ruth brother the relationship go so many years and they used to think that there was another Trinity of women but sister Mya

away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come he shall enter into peace in their beds each one walking in his uprightness let's be seated I want to take this opportunity to thank everybody who has come and everybody who has said good things in memory of our precious brother thank you for reminding you of the things our brother was uh given to Earth and he has done faithfully I'm one of those who benefited a lot from him Ministry and a part of his ministry uh gotten into me uh I thank God for the love God gave him I thank God for The Good Wife the lord gave him a good wife behind a good man a successful Ministry I've stayed with sister Ruth Andor for some time I speak what I I'm a married man I appreciate God for my wife but there's something special I learned from Sister Ruth before I got married she's a sister whom I knew she was not overtaken by pressure situations were difficult sacrificed a lot for the church for believers and he was not a person who gave in his faith for anything there are many things he refused for the faith and that denied the family espcially the sister which she would enjoy because he was was after the faith you know sometimes we think Christianity is simple just enter and become a Christian as long as you confess but Christianity is a life of terrible ups and downs and it is worse when you Minister and it is wor when Minister turns wife many of them have cried and sobbed because of what what their husbands go through I thank God for sister God bless you so much I want to thank God today I know many of you ministers are wondering what is happening today when an important person like this rests we expect an international minister to to come and Minister because he has gone to various places or would expect one of you who have blessed people more than me to come and stand here you surprise but don't take the surprise too far because sometimes God does things which you can't understand and you can't ask him why so accept the situation thank God the one standing [Applause] here we want to than God that He gave us the best in this world he gave us his own son if he us any man we would have wrecked would have have caused an accident because human beings are very difficult and I want to say this that every every place where God steps sat goes there and either family chch to make things look different until people will say we thought this are the people who say they have God but what is happening it's not the people but Satan knows our attitude so he come to use our attitudes but thank God that even when the SAT comes God does not move away from his Covenant he stays with his people and we are sure God will stay with us until he crosses us over praise God just need faith uh after word of prayer I want to say like two three things that would be mymon yeah bear with it the way to come I don't me it be rough but but God I pray he takes over let's pray precious father we thank you that we are here we thank you for our brother he came here for a purpose and he has finished the purpose he would have been taken prematurely are hearing of the testim but you kept him until the work is over the work in his family the work in the ministry and his church and when you close this you open another door we are sure there is another door that you are opening for the family for the church and for the ministry nothing is going to fail we thank you Father that you kept our brother faithful kept the the faith kept the word ran the rest successfully and now he's at home we are not guessing we are basing on fact that have come to us while we alive and you have shown us you can work with a man here and you yourself take his hand and cross him over thank you Father Lord as we speak this few words I pray to I beg to C to leave the Gap to step out and you come and take over and respect your children in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we blessed be the name of the Lord the grace of God is such a thing we can't explain even here when the Bible reads I want to talk about the grace but I want to thank God before I go far I want to thank God for brother in a very special way [Applause] uh to me I'm a person who uh I don't have attraction to people I don't not that I I don't want to I want I love friends I love friends but I love genuine friends and the only way I can be one is when we are friends in the word because if we start friendship on money my friend will not stand I be at your door it's very difficult I don't know whether it is your experience it's very difficult to have a friend who is a who is poorer than you because he will your friendship on what you have but thank God that there's something God has given us that can help us to lean on one another loves the word and whenever he comes around you it's all about the word not about the people about the word of Christ and I think that's the best attitude we should have a person who can tell you the truth and that's how they have stayed with Pastor oio that was what brother oio was when I was having problems of where to to be after coming from Kenya I found peace 1989 Church praise God brother he on the street is in the house whether sharing another point is on the word a man who spoke a man who wrote about it there are many things he wrote about the message he spoke he wrote he preached I love the saturation of the grace of God on the word he had I don't believe that the weaknesses he had make us turn away from him but that is what we are and that what I am that's why God sent his grace to us so the Bible tells us that the righteous perishes and no man lay it on his onay it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from to come even if we would take talk good things still there would be hurs that will not side with what we are talking they always there even if we saw good things even if we give out good things we have here pastors here who have helped people they have done a lot praise God like our pastor here we are he pastor and other pastors let me tell you even if you give even your life you not please all people and when you hear Nega never believe you are because we are we shall never be the same someone will help him and come and say he took from the M he had so if he had little he wouldn't have given so if you hear things about you and let me say this when you hear anything bad about you check are you innocent if inocent in it is inocence which gives you Faith a prophet may come and say you are not going to you are not going to reach home from here ask why as long as long as your heart is innocent as long as you know you have not done anything wrong just believe God will take you home you're going to drive you're going to b a vehicle and reach home we are not supposed to live by threat we are people who are not the same and the precious blood of Jesus Christ even this salvation the Bible says we don't have the same amount of Grace some of us have little others have much but what does that Grace do make you stand in situations where there is opposition we have been we have not been saved to sailed to fight we are going to fight the circumstances that against our salvation and the grace of God lifts us but the most important thing that we should notice that the better you will be the better will depend on how much you stay with God how much you stay near God you know some of us pray when there's a problem and we abandon him we go to church we hear the word and then go home forget about him but the more you stay with God the more let me tell you this there were Apostles there was Paul and others but Paul tells us how much he stayed with God 14 years seeking reading pray and when he came back all of them had the Holy Spirit but this one who stayed longer with God he was different Elijah who stayed in the mountain most of the time with was different we hear of our prophet in this age this is a man whether he's preaching whether he's taking serious he was always with God fasting and praying and I said he stayed so much in the presence of God until it was very difficult to come out of it and I said whenever you stay the presence of God Heaven comes down a our difficulties that are that are hitting us it is because we we spend most of the time in strange atmospheres don't stay long enough with God people stay long enough with God In Prayer in reading the word Paul told Timothy be preachers who have not let us down preachers who have not let us down are the preachers who have stayed with the Bible they don't take it for granted because tomorrow is Sunday just read a scripture and goes there I'm told of a pastor when it was going come to Sunday he would stay in room of isolation the whole night praying and studying and every time we came to the P pit things worked God is Not unfair God is faithful and God is willing to work with us but how much do we stay with you could see you could see most of the time when you reach the house of brother I've been praying over this issue and when I was praying God told this God answered me this a lot of things God spoke to him and showed him directly he was a spiritual man I testify that we are told one night when Andrew met Jesus Christ and he had him for the whole night listening to him he was convinced that this is the Messiah and he left that place convinced and when he got convinced he got concerned for a brother he went looking for Peter that's why we do we fear very badly in evangelism we are not convinced that other people should hear this message we don't stay long with the Lord until we feel a DE to go out and bring somebody many of us are not sure if this message will work they are not sure that the situations in our homes can only be solved by what we have been given let me tell you brother time is coming when money is not going to solve those problems it is going to take your faith in the word and faith comes by hearing the [Music] word god should help us time is going to come when it require what you speak and you will speak what you know and speak what you are and a situation will happen time is coming and God is taking all his faithful ones praise God we must wake up we must know God is about to do something you who is still living you a Target and as a Target you're going to be either the target of the devil or the target of God you going to be a messenger one of these days the messenger of God message of sat you are going to graduate in hat or going to graduate in love brothers sisters let's rise upage that if there is a situation that you know is funny around you with a brother or a sister stand up courageously one time when I was at school and they would preach and I say who wants to come and Jesus Christ it looked so hard for me to rise up and ago one time God gave me courage they didn't look for me but I looked for them where they were my heart was so filled with a bur that I wanted to receive Christ that day and when I received that I was not ashamed I went to the people were doing fishal things with and I told them I'm a Christian God gave me Grace to Have Courage and be witness that I'm a Christian when I fall I must have courage had somebody I must have courage and go to that person and I say I'm sorry I've done something wrong God should help us ministers that we be the first people to do that we shall clean our congregations our congregations are suffering diseases which are not their God should help us stay longer with God when Paul stayed long with God when he could go to a congregation despite the opposition he went to one place it took there two months preaching to those people when there was opposition they pulled out the Believers took them to a certain Hall preach to them five hours a day preaching to them every day for two years you tell me such a person when he's left can you doubt him no wonder soever he would live when he has had many that he has that I believe now what was happening these people who were believing they would take the gospel out and go and tell other people and other people would also come he preaches they go out God should help us people are thinking the work of witnessing is the work of fivefold ministry that's a work of Believers all believers whether you a housewife whether you are a cook somewhere whether you are a pter somewhere you are witness but the problem is our members are not convinced why theyed why are they not convinced some of us ministers we are not convinced I know you are not here who are like [Music] that that kind that kind of ministers are not here so don't have a problem that's the situation isn't it when the minister is convinced and the church is convinced the community will be convinced you cannot reach a community where there is a message chur and people don't know the difference what we believe people can choose and choose they reach a time they Qui and they say surely what they have we don't have [Music] it we need to stayer with God don't just make a visitation and go home you're going sit in the church what ising the head then pick your bipe and go home switch on your TV go to your internet go see God is given a very little chance God God is not cheap is not easily found you don't just go out to here and meet God God is hidden hidden inity and we must seek Him of Lord two God gives Grace to those who are humble and he resists the proud you know the talents we have the gifts we have the the riches we have the beauty and handsomeness we have good way of I mean the Orting the good speeches we have I want to tell you this that cannot wi you the gold the god gold medal no the greatest gold medal that God gives a man humility when you receive humility youed the highest thing some gave them up some gave them up and started dressing like Christians they were abused but God gave them Grace to continue dressing some are beat because of believing this message but God gave them gra to continue some have not reached where they [Music] are they have reached here they Minister sit here with discuss some would have resigned long ago but they God gave them Grace to continue you preacher sermon you hear the opposite and you go home and wonder what wrong have I done I think I should not go back then by tomorrow you have Grace to go back and you're going to preach like nothing happened God gives you Grace don't think that you are so impossible don't think that you are great because you you insist you are resilient on what God has is wanting to be done by taking What God Says is more important there are many people they have heard this message but they don't want to believe it they said certain lady who said we went to college and while we were there they told us do you know those people are right but their gospel is hard to believe a very hard gospel but why do you believe it God Gave You Grace every step of God justification the baptism of the Holy Spirit to the maturity every step you take it courageous take it by force and every time you willing God gives you Grace if things look hard and you insist that I will cross God will give you you will cross so having stayed longer with God you receive the grace of God to do things which are a bit different from others let me tell you God making you a child is not a gift it is a bath it's not a gift oh give me a gift that I may be your son no it's a birth and none of you chose to Bear the children you have just came and we also came and let me tell you whatever God saw us be we are going to be it doesn't matter the obstacles you can look at me or I can look at you as a dangerous person is not going to cross but God understands better he knows who here is going to cross over yes it is God who knows he knows how and therefore gives us the grace how to do it he's the one who has a volume of book where it is written about you the point is are you con what you believe don't look at people look at your conviction right yes I nor say if the Bible tells me it is good to backl I backslide on the principle of the Bible I don't want to backslide because of friends of because because of women because of I want to back a SL because the Bible St but so far I've not find it that's why I'm still standing I believe that's why you also still because God holds it now that friend who is in the denominations and he a child of God and he's a drunker don't mind he will come just keep talking to him don't despise him don't criticize him oh praise God I'm also begging me let me go to my last Point may God bless you so much amen so the Bible says God gives grace to the humble Joseph took him to prison and God gave him Grace to overcome the prison and become auty Pharaoh God gave gave Daniel Grace when when the decree went forth that's when when he did what politics didn't want the squeeze is coming if these simple things are defeating us a little talks about us they don't sleep we GA We Gather people around us to back us up is coming your trouble is under way what are you going to do this are test but the is coming if you are failing test are you sure you're going to to pass the paper are you sure you going to graduate no we thank God for the test how many believe thank God for the test make us recognize who we are if they give you a Pap and you get 13% you already know who you are [Music] you know what you are I fail this test I failed the other day I heard this statement from my pastor I clearly failed I could not go back to church I stayed away from church I said let him stay with this church I fail with the paper now why should I think about it I should work harder I should do better brothers and sisters let us not say let's bear with each other because we are human yeah you would bear with me because I'm human but I'm failing Pur at the end of the day it is me who is not going to graduate for you who are saying you are a good brother you graduate because you are doing your part you are passing but I'm the one who is hiding behind this you know some we want to worship very funny things somebody has talked about me somebody hat me and then I'm explaining to to brother Peter here is not getting it very well but the Bible says forgive brother Peter you have not understood very well let me tell you how it happened what do you want to raise the spirit to hold on it and I fall but the brother is say no no no no the Bible says like this we must continue seeking for the grace of God comes when you are humble amen and gra brings righteousness Grace brings righteousness Grace puts things that you could not do yourself stands for you could not do yourself blessed then finally I want to say this the says many are the afflictions of the righte not church members I hope you hearing very well afflictions are not for church members no no no no afflictions are not for poor people many afflictions of the poor no they don't even say many are the afflictions of sinners no no it is for Who righte and the Lord delivers from all of so I'm saying if you have so many trials then you're rightous because God trusts you he knows every challenge you're going to go through it what am I talking about when right when When Trials come they must find you when you have a good heart you must be a believer in order to go through it we are talking of passing passing the test every test which comes you pass it according to the condition of your heart amen amen that's why in the House of David there every day even when he was Tried by sa he was staying in the bush for many years in the bush they had reason to kill they reason but he never did that he had reason to talk bad about sa not to greet had reason because things were clear other day he escaped the killing other day he escaped the other the other day they told him they had reason but he had a good heart a good attitude to as God is Anointed we have been anointed by the same Prophet we should respect the anointing we believe the message we baptized the we baptized because of the message we are behav we are we behave because of that message why should we not respect each other's anointing do you believe that the anointing from do you believe God spoke to him is it God who said I have a message to give you for this generation do you believe he received it do you believe he left it with us therefore the trouble is our attitudes the trouble is our hearts there's no problem with the message no no the problem is mine so that's why we go back to the same principle If the message says that when you have Hur me I don't greet you I not you the Bible says when we have disagreed I should not pray for you or call you brother if it is there I do that but if it is not there you have reason to ask me what's wrong with you because I would have every wrong how can I say this the message I believe and I behave contr and I am not mad takes a mad person you're hearing the right thing and you're doing the wrong thing the prophet found one man he was eating food the food he was also eating in the and I said he said he said told him why how can you take this good food and put in that bad mouth mouth which speaks bad things the man was just ashamed he never spoke again how can we take this message and put in our hearts and we behave [Music] different God should help us how can unbelievers hear us preach their preaching is okay but their life is not we are mad pastors forgive me but I'm saying there's something inane that has happened to us when we come to the funeral we there's one brother who was preaching a sermon and he said I'm preaching this sermon because most of the time when we at the bar ceremony we say our sister is going to to be with the Lord our brother has G to be with the Lord but we have seen the record record we have seen on Earth how is he going how is she going let's take this very serious every time we see death let us know what caused it it was sin let this be the time activities of sin whenever we see death God should help us I don't want to take you far but I want to finish with this the Bible say says in numbers 9 19 verse 9 when 199 says that Ash of the the red H you take it and keep it to a clean place and must be handled by Lite who is clean because it is the Waters of Separation it separates us from sin sister brother P in the pit with the word of God is the one who separates you from the sin how for me when I pray that's when I know I pray to my God I know my I am repeating the word preached in the pp by your pastor and you believe it it is what separates you from it's the Waters of Separation if you leave it there your sin will remain but when will it not work when it is kept the wrong place it cannot work even if the Bible is the truth put it in a Catholic Church it doesn't continue being good because the system there will di it not to say what it is saying you take it to a denomination it will not do what it is supposed to do it must be the clean place that's why the Bible says come out of my people and come to where I serve this meal in a good place it must be a clean place it must be a word place it's not a a place of fings fightings Whenever there are fightings in the church the word sees working it is what it is supposed to work so let's keep our churches clean come with your in the church if you have it then come consciously and say God I come the where I am dirty I'm now on the altar Speak Lord and clean me I don't want to be a Repro to this the message God gave Moses kept the Israelites above any other Nation there was no B they would lose there was no hunger which would come be no because of the word in a clean place let our hearts be clean Also let's remove those bad feelings and then we shall have effect on the people if I'm rude and I preach rudness my church Ro if I'm immoral and I preach in my church the church will become Church become immoral the church will become what it is when you take the right word in the right place and operating in the right heart then we shall see things happen don't ask we keep asking our where are the Miracles that's why they are not there the message is right but they hold us we are the ones keeping away the the signs and wonders that's why you see Believers in the church they hide and go to doctors in the night because there's no Victory Church must have Victory every day God bless you so [Music] [Applause] much amen sing how sweet [Music] our like me was was Lord now I'm proud [Music] was our precious father it was Grace it is Grace and it still Amazing Grace there's no step we can make without that Grace if we live for God any day we live

saved people because it was a national decree but he stood and preached and wasn't arrested it was Grace that you have your young people now ministers who have the Zeal who have traversed this Uganda

want ites doesn't want it to be there he looks for a ways to destroy it by destroying our testimonies by complicating and speaking things against it but your gra has kept it for us we still believe that you're going to see us through because of this message thank you God that you gave us people in the days when things were difficult you Ro our brother R our brother and our brother they Travers
