[1:26:33] him amen by the putting on of his
[1:26:39] hands may the Lord add
[1:26:42] blessing to the reading of his
[1:26:45] word you may be
[1:26:48] seated so I'll take
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:52] time to give you you a little bit of
[1:26:58] History uh on the 1 of
[1:27:03] December I mean 1
[1:27:07] January
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:10] 1975 I give myself to the
[1:27:15] Lord as I knew salvation to be
[1:27:21] then and I did the best
[1:27:25] can to walk the
[1:27:28] walk and
[1:27:32] 1976 I started as a young
[1:27:36] man to be a witness to the word of Truth
[1:27:41] which I
[1:27:44] knew and then in
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:50] 1978 I took a trip into tororo
[1:27:55] so that I could
[1:27:58] testify of Christ to the people
[1:28:02] there and as I was going
[1:28:06] around there was a team of about 10
[1:28:12] people and they were in a
[1:28:15] house and when I tried to get
[1:28:19] in they told me you are
[1:28:21] welcome I was holding my b
[1:28:25] and little did I know that they were in
[1:28:29] fellowship and as they entered they
[1:28:32] asked me to speak to
[1:28:35] them and so I opened my
[1:28:38] Bible and I began on the subject of the
[1:28:42] priest
[1:28:46] Eli who at the deing
[1:28:50] eyesight and I started talking about the
[1:28:53] deing condition of
[1:28:57] time and at that time when I
[1:29:01] finished I had done I think the best I
[1:29:07] could and then a young
[1:29:09] man stood up and asked
[1:29:12] me after what were you
[1:29:17] baptized and then I started wondering
[1:29:21] what he was asking me about
[1:29:25] and so when we come to understand the
[1:29:31] question I tried the best I
[1:29:34] could to defend the
[1:29:37] Trinity because that's what I need to be
[1:29:41] Tru but you see all my
[1:29:44] arguments were
[1:29:46] beaten and so I had
[1:29:50] heard about the people who believe like
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:55] and so when I asked them whether they
[1:29:58] believed in brother
[1:30:01] Bram they told me
[1:30:03] no they believe in the word but they
[1:30:07] also believe that brother Bram was God's
[1:30:12] Prophet oh it
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:16] was and I wanted to know further on what
[1:30:19] they were talking
[1:30:22] about and so we come to a
[1:30:26] point where I started asking
[1:30:29] them about what do they
[1:30:33] say about the
[1:30:36] prophecy of
[1:30:39] 1977 because they claimed brother
[1:30:41] Branham
[1:30:42] said the people used to
[1:30:45] say that brother Bram said that Jesus
[1:30:49] was coming back in 1977
[1:30:54] but they told me with that we are not
[1:30:58] going to explain
[1:31:01] anything but we want you to take this
[1:31:04] book and read for yourself so I took the
[1:31:08] seven Church age
[1:31:10] book and I read it and I came to the
[1:31:14] time where brother
[1:31:17] Bram spoke about
[1:31:21] 1977 and he says I do not
[1:31:25] prophesy but I
[1:31:27] predict that by
[1:31:30] 1977 you know the you know uh the
[1:31:34] conditions will uh Usher in the coming
[1:31:37] of the
[1:31:40] Lord but you know the
[1:31:47] aser has to walk from the
[1:31:50] door to where they are going to sit so
[1:31:54] the Ash has some kind of a time in
[1:31:56] between
[1:31:58] them so we saw the falling World
[1:32:03] conditions how it started going and
[1:32:06] slanting
[1:32:08] down from
[1:32:10] 1977 and then I just kind of
[1:32:14] wondered about how he was so
[1:32:18] precise in the prediction of the
[1:32:22] decay in of wild conditions from that
[1:32:27] time so when I took it back I had known
[1:32:32] much because all the arguments I
[1:32:35] had were documented by scripture in that
[1:32:40] book so when I went back they gave me
[1:32:44] the seven seal
[1:32:46] book and all this is happening in a
[1:32:49] period of one and a half
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:52] months amen they gave me the seven seal
[1:32:56] book my I read the world
[1:33:00] book in just about one
[1:33:03] week and I went back and I told them I'm
[1:33:06] ready to take the
[1:33:09] baptism amen so I was
[1:33:12] baptized in October
[1:33:17] 1978 octob
[1:33:24] praise the Lord so from there my form of
[1:33:28] witnessing
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] changed from Pentecostal
[1:33:34] Doctrine to the testimony of the message
[1:33:37] of the
[1:33:40] hour and that young
[1:33:42] man who had told me what were you
[1:33:47] baptized is brother Charles
[1:33:51] odipo who led me to this message
[1:33:55] and also baptized me and discipled
[1:34:02] me so I thank God that from that time we
[1:34:08] pned up with him and we went so many
[1:34:12] different
[1:34:13] places in this country trying to open up
[1:34:18] churches and working with the existing
[1:34:22] ones amen
[1:34:24] so in
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:27] 1985 at the beginning of the year he
[1:34:31] told me the Lord had showed
[1:34:34] him that my work
[1:34:38] station amen is in
[1:34:41] ginger and I just couldn't believe
[1:34:45] it because I was literally
[1:34:49] nobody my Ministry was in villages
[1:34:54] and now they telling me I'm going to
[1:34:56] preach in the
[1:34:58] town so when I came down
[1:35:01] here amen I mean things became totally
[1:35:06] different I started looking for places
[1:35:08] to
[1:35:10] purchase in The Villages because I was
[1:35:13] trying to avoid the
[1:35:16] town I told you that we looked for
[1:35:19] places to
[1:35:21] buy and we couldn't find them
[1:35:25] we even ask these
[1:35:27] brothers that
[1:35:29] in isn't there land that we could
[1:35:35] purchase there was nothing so I
[1:35:39] heard uh the Auntie to my
[1:35:42] wife she used to stay up
[1:35:45] in and we were staying on school
[1:35:49] L and we were hiring uh some kind of a
[1:35:53] servant quarter from the main
[1:36:01] house and so the husband to my wife's
[1:36:05] Auntie
[1:36:08] came to
[1:36:10] visitors and you were in a 10 by
[1:36:16] 10 that's how small those places
[1:36:21] were and that's why I was
[1:36:24] living with my
[1:36:28] family and I want tell you that's where
[1:36:32] this church started
[1:36:36] from in
[1:36:39] 1986 and the one of the very first
[1:36:44] Believers is my wife and brother
[1:36:49] Emanuel where is brother Emanuel here
[1:36:52] and maybe my wife both of you can come
[1:36:55] up they were the first church that I
[1:36:57] started
[1:37:03] with and brother
[1:37:06] Emanuel is a brother to my wife you can
[1:37:09] turn the camera and show
[1:37:13] them praise the Lord you just come those
[1:37:17] were the first church
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:32] they are 39 years in the church
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:43] now Sarah you can go back with your
[1:37:45] brother no problem
[1:37:54] praise the Lord that's a brother and a
[1:38:03] sister so we
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:08] had a very difficult time in that
[1:38:12] room and
[1:38:14] then when the husband to
[1:38:18] my you
[1:38:20] know to
[1:38:22] the A of my
[1:38:26] wife he went and says why do you stay in
[1:38:30] such a squeezed
[1:38:34] place and up here in there are so many
[1:38:37] plots that are being
[1:38:41] sold but he was looking at
[1:38:46] me from the face of the family where I
[1:38:49] came from
[1:38:53] with quite big
[1:38:56] abilities but I had
[1:39:00] nothing because this
[1:39:03] message had separated me from my
[1:39:09] family which has a very strong
[1:39:12] Pentecostal background
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:29] and those who have been to our
[1:39:31] place you see such a very big
[1:39:36] house in our compound Back Where I Come
[1:39:40] From and to tell you the
[1:39:43] truth I'm the one who started the work
[1:39:46] there
[1:39:54] so I was walking
[1:39:57] away from something that I had helped to
[1:40:03] start and the one who registered that
[1:40:07] work it was
[1:40:09] me so I was walking
[1:40:11] out it was a very difficult
[1:40:15] time when I believed this
[1:40:18] message I knew
[1:40:22] nobody that was able to support a
[1:40:26] Ministry for about 10
[1:40:31] years so I committed
[1:40:34] myself to something that I fully
[1:40:37] believed from the bottom of my
[1:40:40] heart and I've walked with it up to this
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:51] hour so when he said I said go and look
[1:40:55] for a
[1:40:57] plot so that I can be able to buy
[1:41:00] it but I didn't have
[1:41:03] money let me tell
[1:41:05] you this is the way I
[1:41:09] was brother
[1:41:11] Emmanuel was going to G at that
[1:41:16] time and we used to have this uh uh Hot
[1:41:20] Plate cookers
[1:41:24] and so there was porridge boiling on the
[1:41:31] port because he had to take some and go
[1:41:34] to
[1:41:37] school and then
[1:41:40] patience my daughter sister G where are
[1:41:44] you you can oh okay you know she was
[1:41:49] just about one year
[1:41:53] and she was
[1:41:54] walking stuggling
[1:41:57] and she was trying to m a
[1:42:02] song Love Lifted
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:08] Me and she fell in that pot F
[1:42:15] down and when we pulled her
[1:42:18] out she was steaming in the face
[1:42:25] brother Emmanuel is here you remember
[1:42:28] that we watched the
[1:42:31] first we prayed I didn't have a
[1:42:35] coin to take her to
[1:42:37] hospital so I prayed I walked away from
[1:42:41] the
[1:42:42] house I didn't want to see the
[1:42:47] consequences when I came back around 7
[1:42:49] in the
[1:42:51] evening she was still singing the same
[1:42:54] song Love Lifted
[1:42:56] Me and she was as normal as normal can
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:06] be I trust that was
[1:43:10] God Amen so you know then this gentleman
[1:43:16] found a
[1:43:18] plot and he says come and see we found a
[1:43:21] plot you must buy
[1:43:26] I went and looked at the
[1:43:28] plot but I didn't have a
[1:43:31] coin and I said yes I'm going to come
[1:43:34] back we shall
[1:43:37] buy and then
[1:43:41] eventually what
[1:43:43] happened there is a
[1:43:45] brother in
[1:43:47] German brother God
[1:43:50] rodal he wrote a letter
[1:43:54] and he says I have heard of
[1:43:56] you and I've heard of your
[1:43:59] ministry and I'm giving you an
[1:44:04] offering and the offering was
[1:44:08] $100 and I want tell you that at the
[1:44:13] exchange before the exchange of the
[1:44:16] money that was a lot of
[1:44:20] money I exchanged it
[1:44:23] and we got about
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:26] 1.75
[1:44:30] million and it was enough to pay for the
[1:44:36] plot that's the god of
[1:44:41] Miracles it was a very wonderful
[1:44:45] thing and so the same year 1996 86
[1:44:53] for the first time brother Harold came
[1:44:55] to
[1:44:58] Uganda and when he came praise the Lord
[1:45:02] I was interpreting for him in campala
[1:45:07] and he was going
[1:45:10] toal so in
[1:45:12] between the brothers asked me to
[1:45:14] continue with
[1:45:16] him because I had nothing to do with him
[1:45:19] I was not the host
[1:45:24] and then I said I've not carried
[1:45:26] anything from
[1:45:28] home and now they told me we shall stop
[1:45:32] by and pick whatever you
[1:45:35] pick so we came and parked by the
[1:45:40] roadside and brother Harold insisted he
[1:45:43] wanted to go to my
[1:45:46] house and I told him brother you stay
[1:45:49] here and he says no I must go with you
[1:45:55] I said no it's okay it's just so we
[1:45:58] entered with him and he says where is
[1:46:01] the
[1:46:05] house and I said it's
[1:46:08] here he said there isn't a house
[1:46:13] here so you know but it's
[1:46:17] God working in miraculous ways
[1:46:23] he says don't we have a
[1:46:26] way we can help
[1:46:29] you to have a
[1:46:32] home I said I don't know so he came with
[1:46:36] a brother brother Barnabas kuk from
[1:46:40] Nairobi I'm trying to give you a
[1:46:43] best amen and see where we have come
[1:46:47] from so you know I told him that in wuba
[1:46:53] uh they are municipal
[1:46:57] houses
[1:46:58] Municipal you can buy the
[1:47:02] tenant and then the person goes
[1:47:06] out and you pay I don't remember 700s a
[1:47:16] month so when they gave me this money in
[1:47:19] my
[1:47:21] hand $800
[1:47:24] it was too much for
[1:47:26] me I said how can I give away that
[1:47:31] money I'm going to build on my
[1:47:36] plot so I
[1:47:39] went I had the room this
[1:47:41] way and the room this way and in between
[1:47:46] was a sitting
[1:47:48] area so I built up to the
[1:47:51] top when it came to
[1:47:54] truin the money was
[1:48:00] gone and then I said Lord be
[1:48:05] gracious so after brother Harold
[1:48:09] preaches in
[1:48:12] B you know he asked us what he can do
[1:48:15] for
[1:48:17] us at that
[1:48:19] time you know we were so spiritual
[1:48:26] mind that we are going into the
[1:48:29] rupture because when I believed the
[1:48:33] message I did not believe I had time to
[1:48:42] marrow I thought time was
[1:48:45] over but then all of a
[1:48:49] sudden I was advised that for you to be
[1:48:51] a minister
[1:48:54] you need to have a
[1:48:56] wife so I took Sister
[1:48:59] Sarah she was young then I was not any
[1:49:05] older amen I had dropped
[1:49:09] school because I knew the Rapture was
[1:49:13] coming I should continue
[1:49:16] testifying about the coming of the Lord
[1:49:19] and that was what founded the churches
[1:49:24] the soon coming of
[1:49:28] Christ and so you know I told
[1:49:32] him what we need is
[1:49:37] Bibles I was the first one to
[1:49:40] answer he says what Bibles do you have
[1:49:44] we have just basic
[1:49:46] Bibles and then he says let me look at
[1:49:49] your
[1:49:50] Bible I gave it to him
[1:49:53] I had read my Bible from Genesis to
[1:49:57] Revelation there was no
[1:50:01] concerence and it's me who arranged my
[1:50:04] own
[1:50:05] concerence that this scripture here you
[1:50:09] find it in Ezekiel here you can find a
[1:50:12] related one in
[1:50:14] Jeremiah so one place was blue one place
[1:50:18] was red one place was green and all the
[1:50:23] you know uh highlighting with
[1:50:27] yellow he told me how on Earth would you
[1:50:31] read a Bible like
[1:50:37] that I said that's what we
[1:50:40] have he sent me a
[1:50:43] Bible a scoffield
[1:50:46] Bible my that was important it was so
[1:50:49] special for me
[1:50:52] and
[1:50:55] 1987 he was going to be in
[1:50:58] Tanzania and he told me brother
[1:51:01] Steven come to
[1:51:03] Tanzania I didn't know that I was on a
[1:51:07] test when I was in
[1:51:09] Tanzania he asked me to take one of the
[1:51:13] services he
[1:51:16] went then the next
[1:51:18] time
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] 1988 he sent a
[1:51:24] telegram be
[1:51:26] prepared you are coming into Canada to
[1:51:30] our
[1:51:33] meetings brother SE where are
[1:51:37] you right there brother SE lent me the
[1:51:41] coat the jacket that I went with to
[1:51:46] Canada and my best
[1:51:49] trouser while I was ironing
[1:51:52] I burnt it and I put a Kaka
[1:51:57] here and I went on the
[1:52:02] plane that's how I
[1:52:05] was are you together with me and then
[1:52:08] while I was there received from the
[1:52:13] airport direct into
[1:52:15] places they bought me
[1:52:20] suits I came back back from Canada when
[1:52:23] I was totally new
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:31] man and then I preached out
[1:52:34] there and they said this young man has a
[1:52:38] gift that was when the gift open to the
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:47] world I came back
[1:52:51] 1991 they invited me
[1:52:54] back but then when I came back I was
[1:52:57] given a little
[1:52:59] offering of
[1:53:02] $500 and I came back and drove my little
[1:53:07] house and that was our first
[1:53:11] home we went into there and we didn't
[1:53:15] have even money to put
[1:53:19] locks so our brother William O
[1:53:23] how many of you know brother William O
[1:53:25] from London yeah he transferred with us
[1:53:29] when we entering the house for the first
[1:53:33] time and so we put a bed for
[1:53:36] him in the cting room so when he was
[1:53:41] sleeping he said ah somebody is trying
[1:53:43] to open the
[1:53:45] door because the people I think who kept
[1:53:48] staying in the
[1:53:50] house bad people for
[1:53:53] I think when they opened they found now
[1:53:56] people in
[1:54:00] there so I you know that
[1:54:05] humility this was a
[1:54:10] banker but he loved me so
[1:54:14] much in my
[1:54:16] Simplicity he would always come and stay
[1:54:18] in my one room
[1:54:23] you know this
[1:54:25] message started with
[1:54:28] humility it's not this
[1:54:31] days where people are
[1:54:35] competing it started with
[1:54:39] humility brother Baraza knows that
[1:54:43] brother Bita knows that it was total
[1:54:46] simplicity
[1:54:52] and love it was total love you hear of a
[1:54:57] brother you can go very many miles in
[1:55:06] 1987 I went to the banks of uh Lake
[1:55:11] Albert because I heard there were
[1:55:13] Believers
[1:55:15] there and I tell you it was a very
[1:55:18] terrible
[1:55:20] place when I came back I had contracted
[1:55:25] Ty which tortured me for several
[1:55:30] years but the Lord was
[1:55:36] gracious
[1:55:37] so here I
[1:55:39] come I have uh now you know we started
[1:55:44] having the church
[1:55:47] devor I think it was in the year 1989
[1:55:55] no
[1:55:58] 1988 the church had moved from the
[1:56:00] little
[1:56:03] house and it had come to brother O's
[1:56:06] sitting
[1:56:09] room and that's where I met Brother
[1:56:14] David he came to the meeting in there
[1:56:17] because they had known brother
[1:56:20] th and then he had a scripture he had
[1:56:26] misunderstood I don't remember what
[1:56:28] scripture it
[1:56:30] was but it was saying go back where you
[1:56:33] came
[1:56:36] from and then he was asking me do I have
[1:56:39] to go back to the Anglican
[1:56:42] Church I said no you have come to the
[1:56:46] right
[1:56:49] place praise the Lord so we've been
[1:56:52] around with Brother
[1:56:55] David for quite a long
[1:56:57] time but then the one who has been
[1:57:01] that's also the same year I think
[1:57:03] brother Alex come together with
[1:57:08] us amen they are 88 I
[1:57:12] think and then just as we came and we
[1:57:17] established a
[1:57:19] church some
[1:57:20] brothers that meeting out of
[1:57:25] town amen they heard of
[1:57:28] us they closed their
[1:57:31] group and they came brother
[1:57:35] M you are
[1:57:40] saluted so many
[1:57:43] US
[1:57:45] 39 thus he came when he heard of us
[1:57:52] so I certainly thank
[1:57:55] God who has led us to
[1:57:59] this it has been a long
[1:58:05] journey and so
[1:58:10] today we just want to help the church
[1:58:13] move
[1:58:16] on which is very necessary
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:24] sometimes we
[1:58:27] walk and even when we feel like the Lord
[1:58:30] is telling
[1:58:33] us that now turn into this particular
[1:58:37] angle of
[1:58:40] ministry sometimes we are
[1:58:46] stuck but over a number of
[1:58:49] years I always felt
[1:58:53] that we should ordain brother James
[1:58:56] katumba to
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:03] ordain to take the
[1:59:07] administration and the pastoring of this
[1:59:11] church you understand what I mean so the
[1:59:15] people were asking
[1:59:16] me what will you
[1:59:19] be now according to the message
[1:59:23] the fivefold
[1:59:25] ministry is ordained of
[1:59:29] God it's not something you
[1:59:32] take and then you put
[1:59:35] off are you together with me when God
[1:59:39] calls
[1:59:40] you and he says I've made you a
[1:59:43] pastor it's not at the time when you
[1:59:48] realize but it's God who ordained you to
[1:59:51] be a pastor
[1:59:53] much as I'm a pastor by God ordaining
[1:59:58] me something which canot put off of
[2:00:03] myself I will remain in the
[2:00:06] office but work in the
[2:00:09] body from here when brother James is
[2:00:13] doing the administrative work of a
[2:00:15] pastor in this church
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:25] because it's very
[2:00:27] necessary to obey the voice of the
[2:00:31] spirit so 39 years
[2:00:34] ago we started the work
[2:00:36] here which the Lord has sustained
[2:00:39] without a
[2:00:43] split we have sent out several
[2:00:46] ministers Amen in the 39
[2:00:50] years that we have sent
[2:00:53] out I can just remember some of
[2:00:57] them how many of you remember
[2:01:01] brother Amen brother C
[2:01:05] in we've got brother
[2:01:09] Manuel we've got brother in
[2:01:13] K we've got brother
[2:01:16] kabasi we got brother
[2:01:18] Doo we got brother Jeremiah
[2:01:22] we have our brother
[2:01:24] n who is doing a very commendable work
[2:01:27] among the refug in Western
[2:01:32] Uganda and so many other
[2:01:35] groups that we have started out with our
[2:01:38] Outreach
[2:01:41] Ministry so these are many years of
[2:01:45] service and among us we have brother
[2:01:48] James
[2:01:49] katumba who has been doing the work of
[2:01:52] the
[2:01:53] ministry in our
[2:01:56] midst consistently for 10 solid
[2:02:03] years
[2:02:06] consistently but before that he would
[2:02:09] come and
[2:02:10] Minister and go back to his work
[2:02:14] base but now he 10 solid
[2:02:19] years so I want brother
[2:02:23] to walk up here and take that seat
[2:02:28] [Applause]
[2:02:56] 10 Sol
[2:02:58] years so you know he
[2:03:03] did Civil Engineering at the
[2:03:08] University and he graduated for four
[2:03:11] solid
[2:03:14] years without a
[2:03:19] job but after restructuring this
[2:03:24] building in the Year
[2:03:27] 2005 I told him that the Lord will
[2:03:30] reward him with a good
[2:03:34] job and at the age of
[2:03:38] 28 he became a municipal
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:45] engineer for 10 solid
[2:03:48] years he held that job
[2:03:51] in that job he contributed a
[2:03:55] lot to the present image of the Toro
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:01] municipality he has Faithfully worked as
[2:04:04] an associate pastor
[2:04:08] here for the last 10
[2:04:11] years he has extensively been involved
[2:04:14] in mission
[2:04:16] one he has extensively worked among the
[2:04:19] young people
[2:04:22] he has worked with other ministers in
[2:04:24] the country and out of the
[2:04:28] country he has canell
[2:04:32] couples he has baptized
[2:04:35] people and wed
[2:04:38] couples and not say he has preached
[2:04:42] funerals he has done everything that a
[2:04:46] pastor would do
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:54] he has lived among us as a stud
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:00] Christian we with the wealth of
[2:05:04] Revelation and understanding to this
[2:05:08] message he was he has been a good
[2:05:11] example to the young
[2:05:13] people but we all
[2:05:16] know we all know that a man must be
[2:05:20] voted in office to be a
[2:05:24] [Music]
[2:05:30] pastor amen but yet at the same
[2:05:34] time amen we also know that a vote does
[2:05:39] not make a
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:42] pastor a man must first of all have a
[2:05:48] gift amen and that's what Paul was
[2:05:51] telling
[2:05:52] Timothy that I put in thee in
[2:05:55] remembrance that thou stop the gift of
[2:06:01] God which was in the by the putting on
[2:06:04] of
[2:06:07] hands amen so in the message it is I Be
[2:06:11] not
[2:06:14] Afraid brother Bram says I think of
[2:06:17] laying on of
[2:06:20] hands and giving gifts see gifts and
[2:06:26] callings are without
[2:06:29] repentance they are ordained before the
[2:06:32] foundation of the
[2:06:34] world that's the fivefold
[2:06:37] ministry so we might recognize
[2:06:40] them and lay our hands on
[2:06:44] them amen so we lay hands on a gift
[2:06:55] not laying hands to put a
[2:07:01] gift but we lay the hands on him because
[2:07:04] he has a
[2:07:06] gift and then brother Bram says as Paul
[2:07:11] did Timothy
[2:07:13] there to sanction the
[2:07:18] gift and knowing that the gift was was
[2:07:21] in
[2:07:23] him that they had seen it
[2:07:26] work and they just give him the right
[2:07:29] hand of
[2:07:31] Fellowship to bring him into the service
[2:07:33] of
[2:07:34] God that's the only thing we
[2:07:39] do amen so it's not the
[2:07:43] vote but rather recognizing the gift
[2:07:48] first and then we vote on the
[2:07:57] gift amen so I would want to present
[2:08:01] this gift before
[2:08:03] you and seeing the
[2:08:06] maturity he has exhibited Among
[2:08:10] Us for the last 10
[2:08:12] years as
[2:08:15] steast to give it a vote of
[2:08:20] confidence and Mission it
[2:08:23] officially as the pastor to this
[2:08:27] [Applause]
[2:08:35] church I'm taking this
[2:08:38] order because brother
[2:08:41] Bram presented brother n to the
[2:08:45] church to vote on
[2:08:48] him in the message taking s with Jesus
[2:08:53] he says I would
[2:08:56] suggest if you be the pastor of the
[2:09:00] church as long as the church suggest him
[2:09:03] being a
[2:09:05] pastor that's the vote of the
[2:09:08] church as long as he holds the post of
[2:09:12] Duty and stays with
[2:09:15] faith want to
[2:09:17] come the leading of the Lord
[2:09:21] leing of the Lord for him to
[2:09:24] stay congregation vot the
[2:09:28] same so brother Bram recognized the
[2:09:33] gift and then recomended the gift to the
[2:09:37] church I recognize the
[2:09:40] gift and I recomend the gift to
[2:09:44] [Applause]
[2:09:51] you know brother
[2:09:53] Bram actually brought brother
[2:09:58] Neville when the message was just
[2:10:05] developing amen he said a statement
[2:10:09] here I brought him here by the vot of
[2:10:12] the
[2:10:14] church to be Pastor
[2:10:17] here when even he didn't understand
[2:10:20] these things
[2:10:22] as he does
[2:10:25] now but we thank God we've got a man who
[2:10:31] understands what this message
[2:10:34] is amen he fully understands this
[2:10:40] message and has preached it in its
[2:10:46] eny amen
[2:10:49] so uh
[2:10:51] I would want
[2:10:53] James to go in that
[2:10:56] office and we are going to do the
[2:11:00] vote on
[2:11:04] him when brother NE was
[2:11:07] brought they brought a
[2:11:10] gift before the people to accept it or
[2:11:15] to reject
[2:11:17] it you've got the
[2:11:19] right amen
[2:11:22] so I want to make it
[2:11:24] easy in such a
[2:11:27] way

[2:17:12] t you would always call me my
[2:17:15] pastor he would always call me my pastor
[2:17:22] and I remember
[2:17:26] sometime he told me that he had a
[2:17:31] dream and he told me that the Nile was
[2:17:38] flooded the bridge was
[2:17:45] flooded and then he was asking me how
[2:17:49] did you reach here
[2:17:53] CU he saw that I was able to drive
[2:17:54] through the N which was
[2:17:58] flooded you know many other dreams and
[2:18:01] many things he has been telling me
[2:18:05] about and I believe it has been the
[2:18:07] grace of
[2:18:09] God so I want to appreciate you so much
[2:18:11] for raising me
[2:18:15] [Music]
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:18] up I want also to appreciate the
[2:18:21] ministers who have come here
[2:18:24] today and I would also say brother
[2:18:29] hington the one bapti in the name of
[2:18:31] Jesus
[2:18:38] Christ is the first message church I
[2:18:42] attended and I appreciate God for that
[2:18:48] [Applause]
[2:18:52] I want also to appreciate my
[2:18:55] wife who has told to help
[2:18:59] [Applause]
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:03] me about I believe it's about now when I
[2:19:07] finished univ when I finished my first
[2:19:10] degree in 19 in
[2:19:15] 2001 I believe where Pastor got missions
[2:19:18] in C
[2:19:22] we went with
[2:19:23] brother and then I think we had spent a
[2:19:26] night at Brother's home that
[2:19:31] time that was I think in July or
[2:19:37] AUST
[2:19:40] 2001 and then I had a
[2:19:43] dream it was actually kind of like two
[2:19:46] dreams at
[2:19:48] night and then first dream my
[2:19:52] belief I dreamed when I was driving a a
[2:19:56] pickup you know those days we used have
[2:19:57] pickups which were using as taxes
[2:20:02] 8s and there were too many people in
[2:20:06] it and then in that same night I dreamed
[2:20:10] when like I was holding many people on
[2:20:11] my
[2:20:14] shoulders when I
[2:20:18] told then they told me that you have a
[2:20:21] burden before you
[2:20:24] now and what came to pass that was the
[2:20:28] family I
[2:20:30] had and my wife has been so
[2:20:34] gracious to be a mother to many of my
[2:20:36] young brothers and
[2:20:41] [Applause]
[2:20:44] sisters and then about I think I don't
[2:20:47] remember but about 3 years ago
[2:20:52] I had almost the same
[2:20:54] dream so when I woke up I was
[2:20:58] wondering but then I said but my family
[2:21:00] most of them are better
[2:21:04] now most of them are
[2:21:06] [Music]
[2:21:15] better so then but what came to my mind
[2:21:20] this was a spiritual
[2:21:23] application so I just pray for your
[2:21:27] grace I just pray that you keep on
[2:21:30] praying for
[2:21:32] me and certainly if we can be
[2:21:36] one with the love of God we shall be
[2:21:39] able to fulfill the purpose of God in
[2:21:40] our
[2:21:42] lives praise the
[2:21:44] name so God bless you so
[2:21:47] much than
[2:21:51] [Applause]
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:57] praise the
[2:21:58] lord we serve a good God is
[2:22:02] it amen so you know this
[2:22:08] ministry is a body
[2:22:11] Ministry it's not something like you say
[2:22:16] I'm no longer not a DC
[2:22:23] to be a pastor is anination it's a
[2:22:29] call and I'll be ministering from out of
[2:22:32] this
[2:22:34] church to the body of
[2:22:37] Christ I want to do Mission
[2:22:41] work to go when I know that back
[2:22:47] home there is the owner of the best
[2:22:53] and that's our
[2:22:58] brother and
[2:23:01] also you know there is this thing which
[2:23:04] we call uh
[2:23:11] succession I'm a
[2:23:15] fir that it's very
[2:23:18] important to nurture people
[2:23:23] and when youur
[2:23:25] people exercise
[2:23:27] them in the responsibility you want them
[2:23:30] to
[2:23:33] handle being through and
[2:23:37] through like in the year
[2:23:41] 2006 that's 19 years
[2:23:45] ago and I've been going
[2:23:48] through um
[2:23:52] attacks of
[2:23:56] pressure and sugar
[2:23:59] diabetes for 25 years
[2:24:03] now but
[2:24:08] 2006 Christmas Christmas was a
[2:24:13] Monday but then on the
[2:24:17] 24th which was a December I mean which
[2:24:20] was a
[2:24:22] Sunday I woke up in the
[2:24:25] morning to go and clean
[2:24:28] up so that I can come to
[2:24:32] church I'm going to say a few
[2:24:35] things before we orain our
[2:24:40] brother but while I was standing in the
[2:24:45] mirror and I was cleaning my teeth
[2:24:50] I had a very strong Jack pass through my
[2:24:56] body when I lifted up my
[2:25:00] myself to look into the
[2:25:02] mirror I was flowing
[2:25:06] blood from the
[2:25:08] nose I used the towel I
[2:25:12] had it could not finish the
[2:25:17] blood it was all socked in blood
[2:25:22] blood I opened
[2:25:24] up and I called my wife when she came in
[2:25:29] she was so scared she started saying let
[2:25:32] me drive let's go to to to the
[2:25:36] hospital I said no I'll be able to
[2:25:40] drive and then peace my daughter was
[2:25:43] there so it was an argument between
[2:25:48] her peace to
[2:25:52] drive good enough as I give this
[2:25:56] testimony brother is here where are you
[2:26:00] brother God bless you all of a sudden I
[2:26:04] don't know whether I they called
[2:26:07] him he was already
[2:26:11] there and he drove the
[2:26:14] car they got into the
[2:26:17] car but the towel was so
[2:26:25] red we went to a hospital
[2:26:30] facility which is where there is
[2:26:34] that petrol station they call it what at
[2:26:40] amot
[2:26:42] am stex they used to be a hospital
[2:26:45] facility
[2:26:49] there so so when I was coming out of the
[2:26:52] card They said what's his
[2:26:56] problem then I said I've got
[2:26:59] pressure they said come when I was
[2:27:02] stepping out of the car the blood
[2:27:05] started again when I pulled out my towel
[2:27:10] they said no no no no we can't have you
[2:27:12] let him be taken to the main
[2:27:14] hospital main
[2:27:16] hospital it was 24th December
[2:27:21] you can imagine the count of
[2:27:25] Christmas there would be no person in
[2:27:30] hospital so we tried and they told us
[2:27:33] the doctors are not
[2:27:36] here and then I was
[2:27:39] driven and was taken to
[2:27:42] Ron when I
[2:27:44] goton this is very interesting and it's
[2:27:46] a true story
[2:27:49] [Music]
[2:27:50] they wanted blood from
[2:27:52] me to rule out certain
[2:27:55] things so when they took the
[2:27:58] blood H they tried to put it in the
[2:28:03] machine and then the power went
[2:28:06] off then they ran to the
[2:28:10] generator they pulled the string
[2:28:13] once and it also
[2:28:18] broke and was going going
[2:28:24] going so they rushed from the doctor's
[2:28:30] Place WR a
[2:28:32] generator they started it checked on the
[2:28:36] blood and now they recomended certain
[2:28:39] medicine very
[2:28:43] fast so when they went to the
[2:28:47] phaces 24th December all of them were
[2:28:52] Clos but as I was
[2:28:56] sliding my mind was
[2:28:58] saying what about the
[2:29:02] church what about the
[2:29:08] church and it has always been on my
[2:29:12] heart so finally they
[2:29:16] drove went to a man's place
[2:29:20] drove him very first to his
[2:29:25] Pharmacy and they gave me the
[2:29:27] medicine they started me on the
[2:29:31] treatment by God's grace I came
[2:29:39] back I was very young
[2:29:42] then I was only 4
[2:29:46] years and then after that on two
[2:29:51] occasions I was
[2:29:56] D you know situations would
[2:30:00] happen that a situation my tongue would
[2:30:05] swell and it would want to CH
[2:30:08] me so I was Rush
[2:30:11] hospital I told the doctor I found
[2:30:15] there I'm Ching I'm ching
[2:30:20] he says no that's just your
[2:30:22] psychological
[2:30:25] failure and then I was completely
[2:30:28] going and WR I'm dying I WR I am
[2:30:34] dying I could
[2:30:36] speak so he hired very
[2:30:39] fast put me on a
[2:30:42] medication sorted me
[2:30:44] out and then it happened a second
[2:30:47] time and I've Got a Friend of
[2:30:50] M brother R
[2:30:53] eron is also a retired Minister back
[2:30:58] there but he's still in the church he
[2:31:02] ministering in there he's over 80
[2:31:06] years he told me brother
[2:31:09] St check on the medication you are
[2:31:13] using if it has a particular ingredient
[2:31:17] called this
[2:31:20] that's the one which is killing
[2:31:23] you and when I checked it was
[2:31:27] exact I gave up that
[2:31:29] thing and I was
[2:31:36] okay on several
[2:31:39] times you know I've struggled with low
[2:31:45] pressure and I would spend about a week
[2:31:48] or two
[2:31:50] which you don't
[2:31:51] know and it was even very
[2:31:56] difficult to lift my hand off of the
[2:32:00] bed always on my
[2:32:03] mind what about the
[2:32:09] church one time there is a
[2:32:12] brother who just passed off boom and he
[2:32:15] was
[2:32:18] gone and then I told my
[2:32:21] wife let us go brother so and so as
[2:32:26] pastor and I used to tell him brother
[2:32:28] you've got blood
[2:32:32] pressure why don't you try
[2:32:41] medicine and then
[2:32:43] finally he was gone just just so when we
[2:32:49] got there
[2:32:51] the family was in a financial
[2:32:55] crisis the body was on a mess it was in
[2:32:58] the evening because it died in the night
[2:33:00] and we went there at around 6 the
[2:33:03] following
[2:33:06] day and covered with a
[2:33:10] sheet so after being around for about an
[2:33:13] hour or
[2:33:15] two I told my wife let us go
[2:33:20] we shall come back here
[2:33:23] tomorrow and as I walked out my wife
[2:33:27] said I cannot leave my sister
[2:33:31] alone I said are you going to stay here
[2:33:33] overnight she said
[2:33:37] yes and as I step
[2:33:40] out they called me back and
[2:33:45] the brother St
[2:33:50] the
[2:33:51] funeral is on
[2:33:55] you I said what do you
[2:33:58] me I said you are the one
[2:34:02] responsible I said you have a
[2:34:05] cofin no do you have food for the
[2:34:09] people we are looking at
[2:34:15] you and
[2:34:17] outside there were ministers
[2:34:22] in and they
[2:34:29] were they just me because they don't
[2:34:31] know much English but I can manage that
[2:34:33] church they were deating who was going
[2:34:36] to become the next
[2:34:39] Pastor the body was inside the
[2:34:42] house and they were not finding out how
[2:34:46] they were going to dispose of their
[2:34:48] pastor
[2:34:53] so
[2:34:55] sometimes when I think about what
[2:34:57] happens to the church when you are
[2:35:01] gone if you love the church find a
[2:35:10] faithful find a faithful
[2:35:13] man brother James has worked with
[2:35:16] me 10 solid years
[2:35:20] on a daily basis find a faithful
[2:35:26] man amen
[2:35:29] so when I'm
[2:35:31] gone the question of
[2:35:35] pastorship has been
[2:35:38] [Applause]
[2:35:43] settled but as I
[2:35:45] said I remain here minister in the
[2:35:48] church
[2:35:49] but the entire
[2:35:52] Administration has passed over to our
[2:35:54] brother
[2:35:56] now I do most of my work in the mission
[2:36:01] field to be able to support the new
[2:36:05] work and I have done this looking at the
[2:36:09] principle of
[2:36:12] adoption we've T here about David and
[2:36:18] Solomon David was
[2:36:20] sick and he didn't have enough strength
[2:36:23] to administer the
[2:36:26] kingdom he asked the the the uh he asked
[2:36:31] the
[2:36:32] priest that go and get
[2:36:35] Solomon put him on
[2:36:40] my and let him be driven around the
[2:36:45] kingdom and the people crying
[2:36:48] out God Save the King God save the
[2:36:54] kingon was a
[2:36:56] king when was
[2:36:58] king that's the principle of adoption
[2:37:02] that we are dealing with
[2:37:05] here and when Solomon came
[2:37:08] in he lived under the
[2:37:12] path which was ordered by
[2:37:16] David including the building of the I
[2:37:19] mean of the
[2:37:21] Tabernacle all the
[2:37:24] measurements he stepped into what he had
[2:37:27] been
[2:37:29] said and then he walked with
[2:37:32] it until his father David was
[2:37:36] gone and I have the
[2:37:41] confidence
[2:37:44] brother will keep this message alive
[2:37:48] before us
[2:37:51] [Applause]
[2:37:53] amen amen so I want to bring in a few
[2:37:57] things
[2:37:58] here that I want you to understand about
[2:38:02] the ministry of a
[2:38:04] pastor okay before we ordain
[2:38:08] him like we have heard all seven
[2:38:13] virtues in every Church
[2:38:16] age there were seven
[2:38:19] in every
[2:38:23] age but yet at the same
[2:38:26] time there was a predominant
[2:38:31] virtue in a particular
[2:38:34] age amen like we
[2:38:38] findes the predominant V was
[2:38:43] Faith the predominant was I mean was
[2:38:49] and as we keep going on there was a
[2:38:53] virtue which God held high above the
[2:38:59] others in every
[2:39:02] church and
[2:39:04] also we have had fivefold
[2:39:10] officers working in every
[2:39:13] Church in every Church
[2:39:16] age but yet at the same time
[2:39:20] you know you find
[2:39:22] out that these different fivefold
[2:39:27] Ministries at one time a particular
[2:39:32] virtue a particular
[2:39:35] Ministry was more predominant in that
[2:39:38] particular season of the
[2:39:41] church than the
[2:39:43] others like we find that in the early
[2:39:47] age the major Ministry that was high
[2:39:51] above
[2:39:53] there was the
[2:39:55] apostles amen are you together with me
[2:39:59] so in the early
[2:40:02] church I said the predominant Ministry
[2:40:05] was the
[2:40:09] apostles and all men who came into the
[2:40:13] ministry they always want to claim to be
[2:40:16] apostles
[2:40:19] they didn't say we are
[2:40:21] pastors they didn't say we are
[2:40:23] evangelists they wanted to be uh
[2:40:27] Apostles but then when they had to be
[2:40:31] checked they had to be checked against
[2:40:33] the ministry of
[2:40:36] Paul because he was chosen among the
[2:40:39] rest of the
[2:40:41] Apostles to be the foundation of the New
[2:40:44] Testament
[2:40:46] Church so apostleship was the
[2:40:49] desired
[2:40:54] office but after that the next
[2:40:58] predominant Ministry in the seasons of
[2:41:00] the
[2:41:03] church was the ministry of the
[2:41:07] teacher so in second
[2:41:10] Peter 2 verse one the scripture says but
[2:41:16] there were false prophets also among the
[2:41:22] people meaning that before you know in
[2:41:25] Old
[2:41:27] Testament even as there shall be F
[2:41:30] teachers among
[2:41:34] you who privately shall bring in Domin
[2:41:41] heresies even the Lord that brought them
[2:41:44] and bring upon themselves sft
[2:41:46] destruction
[2:41:52] so the
[2:41:53] apostles were looking at a
[2:41:58] raise of a teaching
[2:42:02] anointing which would at the time be
[2:42:07] desired to be able to cement the
[2:42:10] apostolic doctrine that had been brought
[2:42:12] into the
[2:42:16] church but then among these teacher
[2:42:21] amen we had
[2:42:23] those who sought individual
[2:42:30] Excellency Amen to be above the
[2:42:34] others and they went beyond the
[2:42:39] balance you see you can have the
[2:42:42] truth and you can teach it out of
[2:42:47] balance so the teacher that that time
[2:42:50] came and this one would teach it this
[2:42:54] way another would teach it the other
[2:42:57] way you know like you know Calin
[2:43:04] and you know went told Grace absolute
[2:43:10] Grace and another
[2:43:13] works and they pulled those things out
[2:43:16] of context
[2:43:19] [Music]
[2:43:25] and teachers are sometimes
[2:43:32] guil of over stretching
[2:43:36] truth beyond the
[2:43:39] boundaries and sometimes they Ma on the
[2:43:42] minor
[2:43:49] so they were warn that teachers would
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:57] come and now look at what it
[2:44:01] calls in the
[2:44:04] church brother Bram
[2:44:08] says through poor
[2:44:12] judgment Amen inight to
[2:44:16] battle and thereby cause the death of
[2:44:20] multitudes but
[2:44:25] zuted
[2:44:27] prison amen The
[2:44:34] Godly though it did not this
[2:44:39] brother Calvin's
[2:44:42] dism he was burned at the STI
[2:44:49] so he was being they were being
[2:44:53] warned that after the
[2:44:57] apostles because the apostles you never
[2:45:00] B at that time came wanted to be an
[2:45:04] apostle but they always told you don't
[2:45:07] speak like
[2:45:09] Paul amen and
[2:45:12] today everybody wants to be a
[2:45:15] pastor but we shall tell them don't
[2:45:19] speak like the prophet of
[2:45:22] Mal are you together with me yeah we
[2:45:25] check them against the prophet of
[2:45:30] Malachi amen so in this a true Ministry
[2:45:36] should seek to lift
[2:45:39] Christ above ideology or
[2:45:47] self you don't just on one
[2:45:51] thing but out of everything that's given
[2:45:54] in the
[2:45:56] Bible lift out Christ for the
[2:46:00] people that they may see
[2:46:03] Christ in every theme of the
[2:46:05] Bible it should be the Principal theme
[2:46:08] of our
[2:46:10] Liv if is the principal theme of The
[2:46:14] Bible and the Bible is in us then it
[2:46:17] should be the Principal
[2:46:21] of everything we
[2:46:22] do
[2:46:25] say should be
[2:46:28] Christ amen so then after the
[2:46:33] teachers came the
[2:46:35] season of the
[2:46:39] Evangelist everybody now
[2:46:42] desired amen you know this Evangel so
[2:46:46] and so
[2:46:49] Evel
[2:46:52] Su
[2:46:58] Evangel and when God called an anointed
[2:47:01] brother
[2:47:03] Bram I think this should be put of
[2:47:07] us and when God called and anointed
[2:47:10] brother
[2:47:13] Bram into the office of Mal
[2:47:16] 4 then everybody
[2:47:19] wanted the prophetic
[2:47:23] anointing we are seeing
[2:47:25] Apostles teachers evangelist now God has
[2:47:30] anointed
[2:47:32] Malachi wants to be
[2:47:36] Mal but the difference here is that
[2:47:40] brother
[2:47:41] Bram was not just
[2:47:44] prophesying but he had the voice behind
[2:47:47] the side
[2:47:49] he had a message for
[2:47:51] us but during that time everybody wanted
[2:47:55] to be an
[2:47:57] Elijah amen listen to this here all
[2:48:01] there is been this message Messiah of
[2:48:04] sh Messiah the message Messiah
[2:48:08] of Mah you know he says all there has
[2:48:11] been 100 elij has come up in the last
[2:48:17] days Alexander
[2:48:21] and so many in the world
[2:48:25] today saying they are
[2:48:27] Elijah the Elijah of the
[2:48:30] day Elijah will go back to the original
[2:48:35] Pentecost epes
[2:48:39] church and bring that same
[2:48:42] message to the people with signs of the
[2:48:46] Messiah Hallelujah
[2:48:49] that was the
[2:48:50] difference but then the last major
[2:48:57] anointing the Maj last
[2:49:02] anointing amen that we have is the
[2:49:05] ministry of the
[2:49:08] shepher and that's what we are dealing
[2:49:10] with
[2:49:11] now whever we are now talk about among
[2:49:15] the
[2:49:17] organizations talk about the message
[2:49:20] everybody wants to be a
[2:49:24] pastor it's the last
[2:49:29] anointing
[2:49:30] amen now every Minister that comes
[2:49:34] up wants to be a pastor because it's the
[2:49:38] last major anointing we
[2:49:42] have that will keep the lamps
[2:49:47] together in this
[2:49:49] message before the coming of the
[2:49:52] Lord so you've got a very big
[2:49:57] responsibility that God has given you a
[2:50:01] call that teaches their pastors I mean
[2:50:04] the the
[2:50:09] apostles because your ministry brings
[2:50:12] them
[2:50:13] up the
[2:50:15] Evangelist the ministry of the pastor
[2:50:17] brings them up
[2:50:19] the teachers the ministry of a pastor
[2:50:22] brings them so it is a very big
[2:50:28] responsibility a pastor is a
[2:50:32] messenger to the local
[2:50:36] church amen so in the message Revelation
[2:50:40] book of
[2:50:42] symbols brother Bram says your pastor
[2:50:47] when he stands here on the the
[2:50:49] platform ministering the word of
[2:50:52] God is God's angel to the
[2:50:56] church Messenger to the
[2:50:59] church therefore Pastor should never
[2:51:02] leave this
[2:51:04] word but stay straight with the
[2:51:07] word because he's
[2:51:10] feeding the shepherd's
[2:51:14] place the word pastor means the shepher
[2:51:21] shepher and the Holy Ghost has made him
[2:51:24] overseer over a certain
[2:51:28] flock to feed them with what the word of
[2:51:34] God Amen praise
[2:51:37] God hallelujah hallelujah and the pastor
[2:51:42] is abandon
[2:51:44] Bearer you know when we are children of
[2:51:47] God
[2:51:48] when you are a father there are some
[2:51:51] little things in the
[2:51:53] family there is a friend of mine who
[2:51:57] told me that he broke his
[2:51:59] foot I said why he said my two
[2:52:05] sons
[2:52:11] for they are his
[2:52:14] children so when we are together
[2:52:18] you are the father to the
[2:52:21] congregation some of these people
[2:52:25] here they are little
[2:52:30] children and you are going to carry
[2:52:32] their
[2:52:34] burden if you don't greet them
[2:52:38] [Music]
[2:52:40] today it causes a
[2:52:43] problem if you go to this one's
[2:52:46] function and you don't go to the other
[2:52:49] one it is a
[2:52:51] problem I want tell you you are not
[2:52:55] working with mature
[2:52:57] people you are dealing with
[2:53:03] children
[2:53:05] children they complain over very little
[2:53:09] things they are children so you are a
[2:53:12] burden
[2:53:14] Bearer you are going to bear with these
[2:53:17] people
[2:53:19] When anybody commits a
[2:53:22] mistake some of
[2:53:25] them but when he commits a
[2:53:28] problem he doesn't want anybody to say
[2:53:31] anything they are children and you are
[2:53:34] going to carry
[2:53:36] those brother Bram says in the message
[2:53:39] God doesn't call a man to judgment
[2:53:41] without first warning
[2:53:45] him he say but you see in the church
[2:53:50] there is the pastor and the pastor is a
[2:53:53] special
[2:53:54] man he's built to where he can put up to
[2:53:58] the forces of the
[2:54:02] people his bur
[2:54:05] bear is the of the
[2:54:09] team he the man that can sit
[2:54:12] down when somebody's got something
[2:54:15] against somebody else
[2:54:18] and sit down with
[2:54:21] them both families andon it out and
[2:54:25] bring it right back into
[2:54:28] sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to
[2:54:32] take care of those
[2:54:34] [Music]
[2:54:36] thingss in the church message
[2:54:40] says
[2:54:42] church and the pastor should never take
[2:54:45] sides
[2:54:48] in a
[2:54:51] meeting by saying there is one group
[2:54:53] this
[2:54:55] way and when that the pastor should
[2:54:59] stand between both of
[2:55:03] them get them completely
[2:55:08] reconciled that's a
[2:55:13] p see next
[2:55:15] weekend I as the pastor
[2:55:19] to let me speak about the
[2:55:24] shepher you know a
[2:55:28] pastor should have
[2:55:33] humility
[2:55:36] humility the pastor in The Message
[2:55:38] Church order the prophet
[2:55:41] says the pastor must be a
[2:55:45] man that has got a very humble about
[2:55:51] not to
[2:55:53] Humble but what he could be like the
[2:55:56] Lord Jesus
[2:55:59] Christ when he was wrong going on in the
[2:56:03] church when he SE wrong going on in the
[2:56:07] church he planted
[2:56:10] drops and them out of the
[2:56:13] church and now the Church of
[2:56:16] God is the highest of
[2:56:20] judgment and the pastor is the highest
[2:56:24] order in the
[2:56:26] church the Elder is the highest thing in
[2:56:30] the apostolic
[2:56:31] church outside of the Holy
[2:56:34] Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his
[2:56:37] message straight to the
[2:56:40] Elder and the the Elder gives it to the
[2:56:44] people sometimes he comes to encourage
[2:56:49] sometimes he's so
[2:56:50] humble that he gets a
[2:56:53] whep to drive certain things out of the
[2:56:57] church when the brother acts like
[2:57:00] that he only being a

[3:30:36] be what are you here
[3:30:40] for if you don't like the church
[3:30:46] it's
[3:30:47] important that you be of the same
[3:30:52] mind before I pray over
[3:30:55] you I'll take you to the Book of
[3:30:59] Romans
[3:31:00] 12 and verse
[3:31:06] 16 he says be of the same mind one
[3:31:10] toward
[3:31:12] another mind not high things but
[3:31:16] condescend to Men of low
[3:31:19] estate be not wise in your own
[3:31:43] Concepts if the Lord has blessed you
[3:31:47] above somebody
[3:31:49] else towards men of
[3:31:53] Lo if the Lord has given you
[3:31:56] money and there is a poor
[3:31:59] brother condescend towards men of low
[3:32:06] estate we are a
[3:32:09] Brotherhood we are children of
[3:32:12] God don't be
[3:32:14] seen trying to divide this brother
[3:32:17] against that
[3:32:20] brother that's not
[3:32:27] Brotherhood he says in verse
[3:32:32] 17 to no man evil for
[3:32:39] evil provide things honest in the sight
[3:32:43] of all men
[3:32:48] if somebody has done
[3:32:50] evil it's a blessing for
[3:32:53] you to do good for
[3:32:57] him if youpass evil for
[3:33:01] evil you are not showing the Christian
[3:33:07] attitude regardless of the right reasons
[3:33:11] why
[3:33:17] the B doesn't allow
[3:33:19] you to rec evil for
[3:33:22] evil even if you're
[3:33:25] right and your brother is
[3:33:29] wrong oh that one did not attend my
[3:33:33] wedding not go to
[3:33:35] hising that's not a Christian
[3:33:39] attitude when that one happens you have
[3:33:43] the best opportunity
[3:33:46] prove your
[3:33:47] maturity when you live the life of
[3:33:51] Joseph in those
[3:33:53] matters if Joseph would not be able to
[3:33:57] forgive his
[3:33:59] brother God would have not blessed
[3:34:04] him God blessed him because he saw that
[3:34:08] he had the right
[3:34:11] attitude if a brother wrongs you
[3:34:16] if you
[3:34:21] Revenge amen show me the J
[3:34:26] attitude which God will constantly
[3:34:31] bless don't be
[3:34:33] negative always be positive be a brother
[3:34:38] don't choose to be different if they go
[3:34:41] this side I'll go that
