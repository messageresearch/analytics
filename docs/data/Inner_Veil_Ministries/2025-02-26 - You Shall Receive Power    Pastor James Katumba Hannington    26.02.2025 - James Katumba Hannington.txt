Lord send up just come and baptize everyone amen let us pray father how we are so thankful Lord that we are witnesses to this promise that you sent down the power Heavenly Father [Music] [Music] amen let us our Bibles in the book of Acts chapter one we reading from verse 4 to verse 8 so the scripture says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which says he you have of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days when they therefore come together they ask of him saying Lord will th at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but some talk on the subject you shall receive power praise the name of the Lord you shall receive power so here the scripture says in Acts 1 and verse 8 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall be Witnesses to me both in Jerusalem and all Jud and in Sam andto the uttermost part of the earth praise the name of the Lord so we want talk about you shall receive power and now this power comes as a result of receiving the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord he says we shall receive power after the holy spirit is come upon us now the holy spirit is the power of God so now when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit then you have received the power of God praise the name of the Lord you have received the power of God when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that one should be the desire of every person as long as you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior you want to live a different life you want to be different from your past life and the only thing that can make you different from the past life is because you have received the spirit of God because you know when we are here on Earth you know the scripture says in First Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and then verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knows no man but the spirit of God but we have received now have we received not the Spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of so now the Bible is telling us that we have received the spirit of God now when you look at this scripture in verse 12 it talks about three different kinds of spirits three different kinds of spirits it talks about the spirit of the world which is the devil and all the evil spirits then it talks about the spirit of God praise the name of our Lord and now when you continue reading further you know he says in verse 11 about the spirit of a man now the spirit of a man is the spirit whereby we are born [Music] with praise the name of Lord our birth you know we get the human Spirit which is the spirit of a man and now that Spirit of a man helps you motivates this body you know makes this body alive that's why when somebody dies the human Spirit lives him and then he just it's a body that we are remaining with but when one is born Naturally Speaking the child receives the human spirit and now it's that human spirit that makes this Child Alive human Spirit the child receives helps that child to cont to connect with nature here you know like now growing up like a human being eating like a human being walking like a human being behav like a human being but yet there is also another spirit in this world and that is Satan and his demons and now is the evil spirits the evil spirit can easily influence the human spirit the moment the person is born the evil spirits are always there to influence that person you see that's why the Bible says in the book of Jeremiah praise the name of the Lord and then verse 23 oh Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself it's not in the man that walth to direct his steps I so now the Bible is telling us it's not in man that leave to direct his pathes so having only the human Spirit you cannot make your personal decision but then there is now the spirit of the world and the spirit of the world can take a hold of the human spirit and influence the nature of a person like somebody who likes lying a lying Spirit somebody who likes cheating you know is having a cheating Spirit somebody who likes complaining is having a complaining Spirit somebody who despises is having a despising spirit so now they are kind of different spirits in the world and so they can take on a person and then influence his nature towards the spirit that's controlling him so that's why the Bible says it's not in a man that to direct his pathes because our first birth made us to be born out of the kingdom of God now that's why we need the new birth to be born again of the spirit of God now when we are born of the spirit of God then the spirit of God takes over our control you know takes over your heart and now the spirit of God now starts leading your human spirit in Romans chapter 8 praise the name of the Lord Romans 8 and verse the scripture says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God praise the name of the Lord if you are led by the spirit of God then you are the Son of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage against fear but you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit so he says the Holy Spirit the spirit of God Bears witness with our human spirit that we are the children of God so now there has to be a connection between your human spirit with the spirit of God until your human Spirit can give a testimony that I am not my own but it's the spirit of God that has taken over me that I follow that praise the name of the Lord when the Holy Spirit gets into our lives he controls our human Spirit he controls our personal desires so that now you will always desire through the Holy Spirit praise name of now when the Holy Spirit has taken over the holy spirit gives us the ability praise the name of our Lord the only spirit is in our lives he gives us the ability to do the word of God now the ability to do the word of God that's the power that we have received praise the name of the Lord now you know many people talk about power and now when they thinking about power they are thinking about shaking and to them for means waving the hand and then the people fall down and they show that on televisions somebody comes to be prayed for and then they are shaking and there somebody behind here to kind of carry them when they falling down and they said that man has power I felt the power you know they have that kind of mindset that the power is when you fall down the power is when you shake the power is when you do this a great man of God and when that man of God comes with his power he goes back with his power and then for them they left with nothing but the power the Bible ising about let us go to the book of First Peter first P 1 and then verse 5 the Bible says who are kept by the power of God through faith and salvation ready to be revealed in the last time praise the name of the Lord so the Bible says the power of God Keeps Us Praise the name of the Lord the power of God gives us the ability to perform the word of God the power of God gives us the ability to overcome Temptations the power of God gives us the ability to fulfill the word of God in our lives that's the power he says you shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you praise the name of the Lord and when you have the spirit of God you have the power to perform all the word of God praise the name of the Lord when you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have the power of God to fulfill the promise of God according to the need that you have and now the power of God works in different ways the power of God is resent in you you can pray for the sick and they can be heal praise the name of our Lord whether it's a brother or it's a sister as long as you have the power of God you can pray for a person and they can be heal that's power praise the name of our Lord a demonstration of the power of God the power of God praise the name of the Lord you can ask what you will and then it will be done that's the power of God the power of God will make you live a righteous life because the power he has given unto us is to enable us per that he gives unto us it enables us to perform his word to do the way the word of God says praise the name of our Lord so now that should be our desire that Lord give me your power in me may your power work within my life may your power take over my life praise the name of because it's the power of God that gives us the strength to perform his word praise the name of the Lord so he says he has given us power and that power keeps us through faith un salvation so the power quickens the word of God and then that word becomes a living reality in you so when you are looking for power it's the power to perform his word praise the name of our Lord not the power to run around because somebody can run around without the power of God praise the name of the Lord you can have enough food eaten you can have do some good exercises or drills fres ups and things like that and exercise that muscle power around but we are talking about power that enables you to overcome your weaknesses praise the name of Lord that's the power he has promised unto us you know whereby you are able to overcome The Temptations praise the name of our now in the message possessing the enemy's gate he says in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living Gods power to overcome all temptation in the posession of the Church of the Living this morning the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit In The Church of Jesus Christ whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given to you praise the name of our Lord then he continues to say the Royal SE the that I do shall you do also I I will verify myself that I am with you for signs shall follow you he shall possess the seed of his enemy his SE shall possess the Gate of his Enemy No matter what the gate is if it is sickness Temptations sin whatever get it is it is conquered praise the name of the Lord so he says we have that power to heal all sickness we have the power to overcome all Temptations the power to overcome sin the power to overcome our weaknesses that's the power he talked about you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you now in the message the key to the door he says you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you are my Witnesses in Jerusalem Jud and Samaria the uttermost parts of the earth you receive power after you receive the Holy Ghost but first must receive the Holy Ghost and that is the power of God to manest and demonstrate as you are a human and learn to talk and walk and do things as a human does when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost you are given power to act as Sons and Daughters of praise the name of our Lord so he says when you get the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so he says when you get the Holy Spirit you have got the power to live as a child of God prise the name so when we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit enables us to live the life of Jesus Christ because that's the very essence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to be like Jesus Christ to live the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so power Works within us to perform the word of God praise the name of our Lord the power of the Holy Spirit Works Within us to bring us to transformation that you know the spirit of God can have total preeminence in our lives so now when you are looking for the power of God praise the name of the Lord don't look at you know the exercises people do praise the name of our Lord you know people have mistaken one the power of God is exactly I just an example very simple here brother Bram was on the pit and then he was preaching and then the devil brings a mad man and the other man was used to Breaking meetings preachers so the people were on the platform started running away and then they started calling police then he said no this one is not a flesh and blood Affair so the man came forward big in size of course if it was brother Bram was a small man he wouldn't do anything against him so the man came by the power of the devil stood by the power of God praise the name of our Lord and then brother told this man Satan i c you to leave him and then the man said sp sp on him then said I will show I should as he stretched just to come and beat the prophet fell down before his feet praise the name of our Lord that's the power praise the name of Lord Brother Bram he was not running around to show that he has the power praise the name of our Lord and then brother Bram says that anointing is supreme power under control you know knowing exactly what you are and then he was talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and then Jesus when he went to the synagogue when you can go and look at Luke 4 praise the name of our Lord Luke 4 and then we read from verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to [Music] read There was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found on the place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight the blind to set at Liberty them that are br to preach the AC of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the S were Fen to him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears praise the name of the Lord know he went and then he got the book and he read then said the spirit of God is upon me he read that scripture in the book of Isaiah and then he just went back and sat praise the name of now brother says in the message why are people so about paragraph 252 some people gets the wrong impression of what anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read and said the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the Blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would do want to run all over the building scream and horror to say that I have anointing now run around jump up and down and do all those kind of things but he says but the Bible said laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that is what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how praise the name of the Lord you know brother Bram is talking about that and you know at that moment of time praise the name of our Lord he had been praying for a person praise the name of our Lord and then the person he had been praying for like you know rose up from where they were and then he was saying that's the power of God praise the name of our Lord so now the power of God brings transformation in our lives it makes you to overcome your weaknesses praise the name of our Lord now here when we we can we can go to MTH 2: 29 now they had come and were asking Jesus Christ in the resurrection whose wife is this one going to be and then Jesus answered and said unto them you do error not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God what does it mean the power of God goes along with the word of God praise the name of our Lord the power of God goes along with the scriptures so now if I want to receive the power of God let me receive the word of God praise the name of the Lord when you receive the word of God then you are receiving the power of God praise the name of the Lord now in Romans 1 verse 16 he says I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to every that believeth to the Jew first and to the Greek also so now the gospel praise the name of our Lord the Bible says the gospel is the power of God unto salvation so if some is going to receive salvation they need the gospel they need the word of God Anointed with the power of the Holy Spirit and then that one will change the mind of the person would change thees of a person somebody who was going maybe like at this time to the mind is changed that his mind turns away from those evil things so now that is the power of God praise the name of our Lord now when we go to the book of Acts chapter 26 praise the name of our Lord 26 and then we read in verse 16 he says but rise and stand upon your feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen and of those things in which I will appear unto you delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles and whom now I send thee open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in [Music] me praise the name of the Lord so Christ was telling I'm sending you to deliver the Gentiles that you may open their eyes and you may turn them from Darkness light and from the power of Satan the power of God praise the name of the Lord when somebody is doing evil things he's doing those evil things by the power of Satan now when somebody is fulfilling the word of God fulfilling the word of God by the power of God praise the name of the Lord so now when somebody is doing evil it's the power of Satan but when somebody is doing the will of God is doing it by the power of God the ability that God gives to us praise the name of our Lord and to know the will of God to have the gospel of Christ you need to see that you hear the word of God now the more you hear the word of God the more the word brings transformation and that's how the power of God works within us praise the name of our Lord more you hear the word and you obey the word then more power comes into you you get more might you get more strength praise the name of our Lord you become stronger praise the name of our Lord and then you have you get the ability you know to overcome your weaknesses you get the ability to do the will of God praise the name of our Lord so he says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation now in First Corinthians verse for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are sin it is the power of Goda the name of Lord it says the preaching of the cross the Gospel of Jesus Christ to us it is the power of God it brings transformation changes our thinking changes our desires changes our walk changes our speech that's the power of God that works within us praise the name of the Lord now in 1 Corinthians 2 verse 5 the B says that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of [Music] God praise the name of our Lord now we can pick the verse before this one verse four verse four 1 Corinthians 2 ver4 it says I beg your pardon I think this one is second Corinthians I believe it was first Corinthians it's just the same going for chapter one it is it is 1 Corinthians chapter 2:4 it says and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power then he says that your faith should not not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God praise the name of the Lord so he telling them you look at what the gospel is and you know how the Lord works out is that you don't only demonstrate the gospel but you know there has to be the gospel or rather the preaching of the word because the demonstration can be signs and wonders but then the Bible says there shall arise false christs and Prophets and they also come with signs and wonders but now where the distinction is what is the voice the voice behind the sign what's that voice behind the sign praise the name of our Lord so then it has to be the word of God with the demonstration of the Holy Spirit because the signs give the attraction and now when you get attracted mes at the burning bush now the Bush was burning but then it was not consuming so now that was a sign that was a demonstration but then there had to be a voice out of that sign and now the voice out of the sign was What mattered most praise the name of and that's where the instructions came from and that's what showed the will of God and then PA says that your faith is not put on the wisdom of man but you know to what was spoken to you but it should be to what was spoken to you by the demonstration of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so now when we wait on the Lord you know God reveals himself to us and now the way God reveals himself to us that gives us power praise the name of the Lord overcome the deception of Satan that's why the Bible says the Gates of Hell canot Prevail upon what Revelation praise the name of so that we need to see that the power of God within our lives to bring the word of God to manifestation in our lives praise the name of Lord it is the holy spirit that speaks to us the word and when the Holy Spirit speaks to us the word then you obey that word then the spirit of God comes and quickens that word comes and makes that word of God alive and then you manifest the word in your life praise the name of our Lord that's the power of God that works within us praise the name of the Lord let us go to Ephesians 3 ver 20 praise the name of our Lord Ephesians 2 now un him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us praise the name of the Lord it says the power of God works within us to enable us to perform his word the power of God works within us to bring to pass to bring to pass what we desire what we ask for that's the power of God that works within us so every time as a true Christian it should be the power of God that works within your life the name of the Lord and that power of God works by faith in God you believe God the name of our Lord this is going to happen you believe God you're going to overcome your weaknesses you believe God you're going to overcome your Temptations you believe God you are going to defeat the Devil how that power Works within us praise the name of the Lord and that's how it works within us you know it is right inside of Us Praise the name of and then brother Bram says rure is in US Resurrection is in us so the power is already resident in Us Praise the name of our Lord it has to bring to manifestation what what you have need of at that time praise the name of our Lord now in Ephesians chapter 6 as I try to finish 10 the Bible says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his praise the name of our Lord it says be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might praise the name name of Lord and that can happen when you know what the word of God says concerning the that you are living in because the Bible says the Holy Spirit has revealed to us the things that God has freely given to us so now if the Holy Ghost has revealed us that this is yours then there is the works and so you have to be strong in the Lord by believing God based on the stuation that you are going through in life praise the name of our Lord in the message questions and answers he says that is the promise the promised land is to live in the land of the holy spirit that is God promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit you know like to live your life in the power of the spirit in the ability that the holy spirit gives to us and that's the life that we need to lead every day praise the name of our he has given unto us power power to overcome our weaknesses power to live a right life power to do his will power to obey his word God has given us all that power of Lord so you just need to go forward and obey the word of God and don't look at your weaknesses but look at the promises of God because the holy spirit is here to enforce all the pris God praise the name of the Lord so we need to live in the power of God that the holy spirit gives us the ability to perform his word and then you really don't allow Satan to bind you in his power of unbelief power of Doubt but to live in the power and in the might of God performing his word praise the name of the Lord let us finish with second Peter chapter 1 second verse 3 the Bible says according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that's in the world through last [Music] praise the name of our Lord so he says the power of God has given us all things that concern this life that's eternal life and then his godliness praise the name of our Lord and we get to know this things by the preaching of the word of God so you need to take your time read the word of God hear the word of God word God pray about that what you hear what you read becomes our Lord that's what we need every day let the word of God become a living reality in my life praise the name of our Lord and that's how the power of God will continue work in our lives praise the name of the Lord because that power comes by the word of comes by the Gospel of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord that it can continue working in US based on the will of God praise the name of our Lord so he says you shall receive power the Holy Ghost has come upon you praise all of us we have been given that power praise the name of our Lord we have been given that power power to live the life of Jesus Christ power to overcome our weaknesses power to be children of God praise the name of our Lord that power resides within us and the same power that will raise these bodies when they are dead that's the same power that will take us in the Rapture right now it's working within our lives to obey the word of God that we can be the written epis praise the name of our Lord may God bless you amen let us sing that song they were in the upper chamber again as we prepare to pray praise the name of our Lord so if you are looking for power power of God is in his word just obey the word and then the spirit of God brings that power to work within our lives praise the name of our Lord you may not need to say Let Me Wait for this meeting the other next time or let me go to the cave or to the mountain as long as we come to the service of God like this the power of God is present praise the name of the Lord when Jesus was ministering
