[13:54] on me. Let the light from the light
[14:00] house shine

[14:05] Amen.
[14:09] I wish I could sing more and more.
[14:12] Praise the name of our Lord. I don't
[14:14] know if we know that song. It's the
[14:15] midnight cry.
[14:19] Praise the name of our Lord. I want to
[14:22] speak about the midnight cry.
[14:27] We are in the midnight time.
[14:31] So, we had the shout.
[14:35] Praise the name of our Lord. We've heard
[14:37] the midnight cry.
[14:40] And then the Bible says, "Go out to meet
[14:43] him.
[14:49] the chorus. I don't know if
[14:54] I don't know how
[14:57] there's another song. Maybe
[15:00] it's the midnight
[15:02] cry.
[15:04] I don't know if we can get that. Trying
[15:06] to get it here.
[15:09] I really want to sing that song.
[15:22] Okay, let us sing that song. John saw
[15:25] that number.
[15:27] Are you in that number?
[15:30] Amen. Let us rejoice in the presence of
[15:33] God.
[15:35] I really enjoyed the morning service.
[15:39] It was soul cleansing.
[15:42] Praise the name of God. I just wanted to
[15:45] hear more and more, more and more.
[15:49] And I pray God helps me to die daily.
[15:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Say that if
[15:59] somebody abuses me
[16:02] and I'm dead, I will not abuse back.
[16:07] I just want to die daily.
[16:11] that if somebody does anything bad to
[16:13] me, hates me,
[16:16] and I'm dead, I'm not hate back.
[16:20] Praise the name of
[16:23] I'm in that number.
[16:27] I'm in that number.
[16:31] I'm in that number.
[16:34] [Applause]
[16:35] [Music]
[16:39] I'm in God's number.
[16:43] I'm in God's number.
[16:47] I'm in God's number.
[16:51] [Music]
[16:52] [Applause]
[16:55] Your soul at number
[17:00] [Music]
[17:19] so that come
[17:24] The blood was number

[18:06] It is the number
[18:11] one.
[18:14] It is number
[18:19] [Music]
[18:27] one.
[18:29] Are we in the number?
[18:33] I come down.
[18:37] I come.
[18:41] Oh,

[18:45] I

[18:50] number
[18:52] [Music]
[18:58] one. Amen. Let's give a little praise.
[19:03] Amen.
[19:05] Let us pray.
[19:07] Father, how we are thankful unto you,
[19:09] Lord.
[19:10] It is our confession, heavenly father,
[19:14] that we are in that number
[19:17] that John saw,
[19:19] the redeemed of the law,
[19:22] that we are thankful, heavenly father,
[19:25] that from the beginning of the creation,
[19:29] all creatures have been looking forward
[19:31] at this time.
[19:34] whereby father you are coming to take
[19:37] your bride.
[19:39] We are grateful heavenly father
[19:42] that lord we've heard the midnight cry
[19:46] and here we are in our preparations
[19:47] father
[19:49] uniting with the bridegroom
[19:52] that soon father we shall be with him
[19:57] and be like him. May you bless us again,
[20:00] Father, that you may speak to our
[20:02] hearts, Lord Jesus.
[20:04] You may help us every day that we live,
[20:07] that we may be able to die daily
[20:10] and may be able to be ready for the
[20:12] rapture.
[20:13] We love you, Lord, and we thank you,
[20:15] Father. Speak us again, Lord. Meet all
[20:18] the needs of all your children
[20:21] upon this service in the name of the
[20:24] Lord Jesus, we pray.
[20:26] Amen. Amen. Let us go to Matthew chapter
[20:29] 25
[20:33] reading from verse 1 to verse 10.
[20:38] And we just want to take an hour
[20:42] and share on the midnight cry.
[20:46] He says, "Then shall the kingdom of
[20:49] heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which
[20:52] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[20:54] the bridegroom.
[20:59] [Music]
[21:06] And five of them were wise, and five
[21:08] were foolish.
[21:15] They that were foolish took their lamps
[21:18] and took no oil with them.
[21:26] But the wise took oil in their vessels
[21:29] with their lamps.
[21:38] While the bridegroom turret, they all
[21:41] slumbered and slept.
[21:47] And at midnight there was a cry made,
[21:50] "Behold, the bridegroom cometh. going
[21:53] out to meet him.
[22:03] Then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[22:06] their lamps.
[22:12] And the fish said unto the wise, "Give
[22:15] us of your oil, for our lamps are gone
[22:17] out.
[22:27] But the wise answered, saying, "Not so,
[22:29] lest there be not enough for us and you.
[22:32] But go you rather to them that sell, and
[22:35] buy for yourselves,
[22:47] And while they were went to buy, the
[22:50] bridegroom came, and they that were
[22:52] ready went in with the to the marriage,
[22:55] and the door was shut.
[23:07] the go of his word. You may be seated.
[23:12] So we are talking about the midnight
[23:14] cry.
[23:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[23:19] Bible says
[23:22] that the bridegroom turned
[23:27] and then the virgins.
[23:31] They all
[23:33] slumbered
[23:36] and slept.
[23:39] And then the midnight cry
[23:43] comes in the middle of the night.
[23:47] And you know what happens in the night
[23:51] is that people are deep asleep
[23:55] and it is dark in the night.
[23:59] And so many people don't know what is
[24:02] happening.
[24:04] And so you find that even the many
[24:08] battles which are always done,
[24:12] they always do them in the night.
[24:15] Like now you've seen you've been seeing
[24:16] what has been happening to Iran.
[24:20] You know they just bombarded them with
[24:22] meals at night.
[24:30] You know, so at night
[24:33] is normally where some things which are
[24:37] unique happen.
[24:41] It's always at night.
[24:44] And now you would start asking yourself
[24:47] if really the Lord wants to take us
[24:51] why does he come at night?
[24:54] Why doesn't it come daytime when all
[24:56] people are seeing it?
[24:58] You know that's a form of social gospel.
[25:03] Everybody get saved.
[25:06] Like we can say ginger for Christ.
[25:09] All ginger is going to be saved.
[25:12] But the Bible says
[25:14] only few be saved.
[25:19] Praise the name of our Lord. Only few be
[25:22] saved.
[25:24] In the book of Luke 13
[25:27] and then verse 2 verse 24,
[25:31] the Bible says, "And he went through the
[25:34] cities and villages
[25:37] teaching and journeying towards
[25:39] Jerusalem."
[25:47] Then said one unto him, Lord, there are
[25:51] few that be saved. And he said unto
[25:54] them,
[26:03] strive to enter in at the straight gate.
[26:06] For many, I say unto you, will seek to
[26:09] enter in and shall not be able.
[26:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[26:26] when he was going through the cities
[26:29] and you know the ministry of our Lord
[26:31] Jesus Christ
[26:33] it was full of all the power of God
[26:38] that anything would happen at any time.
[26:42] He would stop the nature.
[26:45] He would heal the blind, the lame, you
[26:49] know, the dead would rise
[26:52] anything.
[26:54] But then even in the midst of that
[26:57] vindicated ministry,
[27:01] there were only few
[27:04] that accepted him. There were only few
[27:08] that would be saved.
[27:11] And then the Lord Jesus tells this
[27:12] person,
[27:15] strive to enter in at the straight gate.
[27:22] And that's also the same concern for us.
[27:26] Let us strive to enter in at the
[27:28] straight gate.
[27:31] There were 10 virgins.
[27:34] But there were only five who were wise.
[27:38] All the virgins
[27:40] Brother tells us they were clean
[27:44] because virginity means being clean,
[27:46] being pure.
[27:50] So they were not smokers,
[27:52] they were not drinking.
[27:54] But then five
[27:57] were wise.
[27:59] And then the Bible says they took their
[28:02] lamp with them
[28:04] with vessels that had oil.
[28:09] While the foolish virgins
[28:11] took their lamps,
[28:13] but they never took vessels with them.
[28:18] And then you see here,
[28:21] the Bible tells us here, let us go to
[28:24] Psalms 119.
[28:28] Praise the name of our Lord. Psalms 119.
[28:34] And then we read in
[28:37] verse
[28:44] verse 105.
[28:47] It says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my
[28:51] feet and a light unto my path."
[29:01] So the lamp
[29:03] stood for the word.
[29:06] They all had the word.
[29:09] But then the foolish ones
[29:13] never took oil
[29:17] in their vessels
[29:19] and we are the vessels of God.
[29:23] Praise the name of our Lord. So then the
[29:25] word that they had,
[29:28] praise the name of our Lord, had not
[29:30] become a living reality in them.
[29:35] Praise the name of our Lord. They lapped
[29:37] the power in the word
[29:41] while the wise ones had oil,
[29:46] the power, the Holy Spirit to make this
[29:51] word alive
[29:54] because the lamp
[29:56] cannot light on its own.
[29:59] The lamp was always connected to a
[30:02] vessel
[30:05] and then the vessel would supply the
[30:07] oil.
[30:09] Praise the name of our Lord. And you see
[30:11] these things are very interesting.
[30:14] Like when you go to the book of
[30:16] Zachariah,
[30:18] praise the name of the Lord. He talks
[30:20] about the two olive trees
[30:23] and then the two olive trees.
[30:25] No supplying.
[30:28] Praise the name of Lord. And then you
[30:30] see here brother Brahma tells about the
[30:33] old and the new testament.
[30:37] So you need to hear the word,
[30:39] receive the Holy Spirit and you need the
[30:42] Holy Spirit to put that word to be
[30:45] alive.
[30:47] Praise the name of our Lord. So it all
[30:49] calls us
[30:51] for full obedience.
[30:55] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[30:56] read, I think is in the message
[30:58] questions and answers.
[31:01] Brother Brandham says that the foolish
[31:04] virgin
[31:06] will go through the tribulation period
[31:10] because they never received atonement
[31:14] in its fullness.
[31:17] So it's the time now
[31:20] that when we hear the midnight cry,
[31:25] we are receiving full atonement.
[31:29] So you need to get that whole atonement.
[31:35] It's fullness,
[31:37] not have atonement,
[31:40] not only stopping at being a good church
[31:43] member.
[31:46] Praise the name of our Lord. But you
[31:48] need to see that you take the whole
[31:50] council of God.
[31:53] And so when you take the whole council
[31:55] of God,
[31:57] then you'll find yourself that you are
[32:00] having what the Lord desires us to have.
[32:05] Praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[32:07] Bible says, "Strive to enter in at the
[32:11] gate.
[32:13] Don't stop at being a church member.
[32:16] Don't stop at maybe I dress well.
[32:20] Don't stop at all those good things,
[32:24] but go into having a personal
[32:26] relationship with God
[32:30] like Simeon. The Bible says Simeon was
[32:35] devoted
[32:37] and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And
[32:41] then the same Holy Ghost revealed to
[32:44] Simeon.
[32:45] I believe when Simeon was bus studying
[32:48] the Bible
[32:50] and then you would see the promises in
[32:51] the scripture
[32:53] how the Lord would send a Messiah
[32:57] waiting on the Lord. Lord we are waiting
[33:00] for this promise
[33:02] and then the Holy Ghost comes down on
[33:05] him and reveals to him that you are not
[33:09] going to die.
[33:11] until you see the Lord is Christ.
[33:14] Praise the name of God. And we also
[33:16] living in the same time of sin
[33:19] is that God has sent us the message.
[33:23] And the message of the hour is the
[33:26] midnight cry.
[33:28] The message of the hour is the shout for
[33:31] the coming of the Lord.
[33:34] So now when we hear the midnight cry,
[33:39] when we hear the shout, we need to see
[33:42] that all preparations are ready.
[33:47] Praise the name of our Lord. What we is
[33:49] required of us. Let me do what the Lord
[33:52] has told me today.
[33:54] Like like Elijah,
[33:56] he repair the altar.
[33:59] Repair the altar of your life.
[34:03] You pray the alt of your heart.
[34:06] See that there's nothing wrong in you.
[34:09] There's nothing that brings the Holy
[34:10] Ghost in you.
[34:12] And you know he put everything in order.
[34:16] Then he said, "Lord, I have done as you
[34:18] commanded me." And then you see the
[34:21] spirit of God coming,
[34:24] God himself coming to direct us.
[34:27] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[34:30] message the rapture
[34:32] brother Brandham says now I want you to
[34:34] notice
[34:36] a great thing taking place here
[34:39] don't miss
[34:41] he says the word says in Thessalonians
[34:46] that verse 13 verse 16
[34:54] there is three things that happen
[34:57] before the Lord appears
[35:00] quickly now. So we can close the thing
[35:04] that happens
[35:06] a shout,
[35:08] a voice, a trump,
[35:12] praise the name of our Lord. Now that's
[35:14] in 1 Thessonians chapter verse chapter
[35:17] verse 16.
[35:20] He says,
[35:23] "For the Lord himself
[35:26] shall descend from heaven
[35:30] with a shout
[35:33] and with the voice of the archangel
[35:37] and the trump of God.
[35:40] Praise the name of our Lord." So this
[35:42] happens.
[35:44] The Lord himself shall descend
[35:48] with a shout,
[35:51] with the voice of the archangel,
[35:54] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[35:57] in Christ shall rise first.
[36:01] And then he says, a shout,
[36:05] a voice, a trumpet to happen before
[36:10] Jesus appears.
[36:14] Jesus does all of them
[36:18] when he is descending.
[36:21] Now you see what brother Brham is
[36:23] telling us because all these things are
[36:26] done by Christ himself
[36:28] when he is coming when he's descending
[36:33] and he does this
[36:35] before he appears or before we can see
[36:37] him physically.
[36:41] A shout
[36:43] What is the shout? It's a message going
[36:46] forth.
[36:48] The living bread of life
[36:52] bringing forth the bride.
[36:56] Now God has a way of doing things
[37:00] and he never changes
[37:03] his policy. He never changes. He's the
[37:06] unchanging God.
[37:09] Amos 3:7,
[37:12] he would do nothing on earth until
[37:13] revealed it to his servants, the
[37:15] prophet.
[37:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So we know
[37:20] God has sent us a prophet.
[37:23] We have the message of the hour and the
[37:27] message of the hour is the shout.
[37:31] Praise the name of our Lord. They shall
[37:34] to prepare us
[37:37] to prepare us for the rapture.
[37:39] Then in paragraph 141,
[37:43] the first thing comes when he starts
[37:45] descending from heaven,
[37:48] there is a shout. What is it? It's a
[37:52] message
[37:53] to get the people together.
[37:57] A message comes forth
[37:59] now. Lamp trimming time.
[38:05] Rise and trim your lamps.
[38:08] Watch. What was that?
[38:13] The seventh.
[38:15] Not the sixth.
[38:17] The seventh. Behold a bridegroom cometh.
[38:22] Rise and trim your lamps.
[38:25] And they did.
[38:29] Some of them found they didn't even have
[38:31] enough oil in their lamp.
[38:35] But it is lamp trimming time.
[38:41] It is Malachi 4 time
[38:44] Luke 17
[38:46] all those prophecy
[38:48] that it can perfectly set in order for
[38:52] this day.
[38:55] We see it living right there.
[38:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[39:01] midnight cry
[39:03] is the message of the hour.
[39:06] The midnight cry is the same shout here
[39:09] in 1 Thessalonians 4:16.
[39:14] And I can say the midnight cry
[39:18] is going forth now.
[39:21] The shout is going forth now.
[39:24] When you hear the message, you are
[39:27] hearing the shout.
[39:29] You are hearing the midnight cry. Arise
[39:32] and trim your lungs.
[39:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Be filled
[39:36] with the oil.
[39:38] Make sure that you are living the life
[39:40] of Jesus Christ.
[39:42] Make sure that you are ready for the
[39:43] rapture.
[39:46] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[39:48] live a life whereby you are ready for
[39:51] the translation,
[39:53] ready for the change of our bodies.
[39:56] Praise the name of our Lord because it
[39:58] it comes in the darkest of the night
[40:02] when people are slumbering in the things
[40:04] of the world.
[40:07] When people are too busy,
[40:11] you know this project after this project
[40:15] is this project after this course and
[40:18] this course after this work this work.
[40:22] After farming
[40:24] I need to process.
[40:26] After processing I need to export. After
[40:30] exporting I need to do research. After
[40:33] doing research, you get new trends,
[40:37] endless projects.
[40:40] It comes in the darkest of the night.
[40:43] You are so much occupied with your
[40:45] affairs.
[40:48] One course after another course, one
[40:50] course after another, one course after
[40:51] another course, one program after
[40:54] another program, one program after
[40:55] another program
[40:58] in the project.
[41:00] When it finishes, I'm going to a project
[41:02] in Moroto
[41:04] and then from Moro I'll go to
[41:06] you have a lineup of 10 years or 20
[41:09] years or 30 years
[41:14] and every day you have is Sunday.
[41:18] So Sunday you want to rest
[41:21] coming to church again. No, you're
[41:23] tired,
[41:24] but you're not tired during the
[41:25] weekdays,
[41:28] but you are tired on the Lord's day.
[41:31] Slumber,
[41:34] they were asleep.
[41:37] Praise the name of the Lord. So you
[41:39] sleep
[41:41] by being too busy
[41:44] this project, this program, the other
[41:48] one, the other one. And then the Bible
[41:50] says that day comes when you are not
[41:53] aware.
[41:55] Then you start wondering
[41:58] what is happening nowadays.
[42:01] Maybe you pass around.
[42:04] Maybe let me go for church. You realize
[42:07] ah the church has been closed.
[42:12] But but I found some men there.
[42:16] Brother Brandham says, "Our churches
[42:18] shall become stores.
[42:24] They are going to take them over by the
[42:25] religious organization
[42:28] and then they start using them for their
[42:30] program."
[42:32] And now maybe that's the time for you
[42:34] feel a little bit spiritual.
[42:44] and praying
[42:47] and fasting.
[42:49] Then you start making calls
[42:53] today. You didn't pray
[42:55] slumber
[42:58] and it is late.
[43:01] Then you start wondering you mean these
[43:03] things are happening now. Then you come
[43:05] to realization all these projects I've
[43:07] been doing.
[43:13] Now they start asking you
[43:16] where is where is our mark?
[43:23] Where is your mark?
[43:26] Because these things are going to come
[43:28] to pass
[43:30] when you don't have the mark of the
[43:32] beast
[43:33] or the the mark of the image of the
[43:35] beast
[43:37] in the forehead
[43:40] or in your hand.
[43:42] You don't belong to any of them.
[43:46] No buying, no selling. So even your
[43:49] projects are going to be affected.
[43:54] But we have the midnight cry.
[43:59] We are in the time like the
[44:00] longsuffering of Noah.
[44:05] God told Noah, "Build the ark." And Noah
[44:09] was not building the ark in secret.
[44:14] But they were seeing the man carrying
[44:16] trees,
[44:18] cutting them. What are you doing? I'm
[44:21] building the ark. Why are you building
[44:23] the ark on a dry land?
[44:26] Why not near the sea here?
[44:29] It's going to rain. It's going to rain.
[44:32] And brother Brandham says it was not
[44:35] raining those days. They had better
[44:37] science
[44:39] and that science would look through the
[44:41] sky
[44:44] and then they would do prediction. There
[44:45] was no rain in the sky.
[44:48] It was during those days of Noah
[44:51] when they had that kind of dying of
[44:53] clothes
[44:56] and that that color would not would not
[44:59] fade for thousands of years.
[45:05] It's during that time that they build
[45:07] this big big great pyramid
[45:11] structures
[45:13] until they don't know how those things
[45:14] were built.
[45:17] And then he was saying it's going to
[45:19] rain
[45:21] said look at this old man for 120 years
[45:26] he preached the gospel it's going to
[45:29] rain.
[45:31] We also have the shout
[45:34] message of the earth. It's just the
[45:36] longsuffering of God.
[45:40] But now that we have heard
[45:43] let us be ready. Praise the name of our
[45:46] Lord. Be ready. Keep your lamps trimmed.
[45:51] Be filled with the oil.
[45:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Allow the
[45:56] life of Christ to flow freely through
[45:58] you.
[46:00] Let the spirit of God dwell in your
[46:02] life.
[46:04] So that that day does not take you
[46:07] unaware.
[46:10] Praise the name of our Lord. Then in
[46:12] paragraph 164
[46:15] the message rapture. It says therefore
[46:19] the message calls the bride together.
[46:23] See the shout
[46:27] the same one.
[46:29] He with a loud voice
[46:32] he screamed out
[46:35] with a that shout and a voice
[46:38] and woke Lazarus
[46:41] with a loud voice cried
[46:44] Lazarus
[46:46] come forth and the voice wakes up
[46:53] the sleeping bride
[46:56] the sleeping dead.
[46:59] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[47:01] shout is the message.
[47:03] Then the voice of the archangel
[47:06] is the voice of the resurrection
[47:09] that raises the dead in Christ.
[47:13] Praise the name of our Lord. And now
[47:14] when the dead in Christ are raised up,
[47:18] praise the name of our Lord. And you
[47:20] know
[47:22] any time the trumpet is going to sound.
[47:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[47:29] the scriptures.
[47:31] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[47:34] there are some people they come and tell
[47:36] you the seven thunders are not revealed
[47:41] and then they want somebody else to come
[47:42] and reveal them.
[47:45] But the me the message of Malachi 4
[47:50] Revelations 10:7,
[47:53] his purpose
[47:55] is to reveal all the mysteries of God.
[48:00] Now in the message the seventh seal,
[48:03] he says the seven thunders are not yet
[48:05] revealed.
[48:08] But now when he continues in his
[48:10] message,
[48:12] he says the seven thunders
[48:14] they are connected to the coming of the
[48:16] Lord Jesus.
[48:19] And now when you go to the message,
[48:20] Christ is the mystery of God revealed,
[48:24] he brings some of that truth,
[48:28] how he is, how he's coming.
[48:31] When you got the message rapture,
[48:33] he tells us how he comes
[48:36] and when he comes.
[48:39] Praise the name of our Lord. So you must
[48:41] trim your lamps.
[48:44] You must be filled with the oil. And now
[48:47] when you trim your lamps and you are
[48:49] filled with your oil,
[48:51] you will see the dead in Christ living
[48:54] amongst us.
[48:57] Praise the name of our Lord. We shall
[48:59] see our brothers who have gone ahead of
[49:01] us,
[49:03] walking amongst us when they are young.
[49:06] Then you know any time within 40 days
[49:12] we shall be changed.
[49:14] Praise the name of our Lord. So it will
[49:17] not take us an awareness.
[49:20] But if you are sleeping and slumbering
[49:24] busy in other things,
[49:26] the things of God don't matter a lot to
[49:28] you,
[49:30] you'll be taken unaware.
[49:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[49:36] says,
[49:38] "And a trumpet
[49:40] with the sound of a trumpet,
[49:43] and what does it do?
[49:46] a trumpet called Israel to the feast of
[49:50] the trumpets
[49:52] which was a Pentecostal feast,
[49:56] the great feast in the sky
[50:00] and the feast of the trumpet.
[50:02] So a trumpet
[50:04] do announce a calling together.
[50:09] Come to the feast.
[50:12] And now that is the Lord's supper in the
[50:15] sky.
[50:18] Praise the name of our Lord. And tonight
[50:20] we're also going to have the Lord's
[50:21] supper.
[50:23] A communion with Christ.
[50:26] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[50:29] in the book here,
[50:32] let us go to the book of Luke chapter 21
[50:38] and then verse 34
[50:45] and take heed to yourselves, lest at any
[50:49] time your hearts be overcharred with
[50:51] suffing and drunkenness and cares of
[50:55] this life. And so that day come upon you
[50:59] unawares.
[51:22] Amen. Amen. So he says take heed
[51:28] that your heart is not overcharged.
[51:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Oh, you
[51:37] know I have to get money. Sure, you have
[51:40] to get money,
[51:42] but there's also time for God.
[51:46] Praise the name of our Lord. But then
[51:47] the challenge is when we go to look for
[51:50] money,
[51:53] we forget God.
[51:57] So the whole day you've not thought
[51:58] about God.
[52:00] The whole day you have not thought about
[52:02] God.
[52:04] You are thinking about this deal.
[52:06] Meeting the other person beating the
[52:07] other one. Making the other enemy
[52:11] overcharged
[52:14] overcharged with the cares of this life.
[52:19] So the life itself is taken up by other
[52:22] things.
[52:25] The things of God are meaningless.
[52:30] All the things of God are just their
[52:32] subsidiary.
[52:39] After doing that
[52:41] then you bring in
[52:46] protected but you've not thought about
[52:57] the head you have not been talking about
[52:58] yet you allow him to take the head.
[53:02] He has to be the head sheep
[53:05] not the tail end.
[53:09] You know that's that the nature of man
[53:13] when they prepare functions
[53:16] they put everything there.
[53:19] Then they just remember in the closing
[53:21] remarks
[53:27] we someone has not prayed for us and
[53:29] then they say ah this one can pray for
[53:31] us
[53:33] when everybody is tired
[53:36] when you have a function at home
[53:39] they just remember about God something
[53:40] small
[53:45] you bring a prayer but the rest of the
[53:48] things God is out
[53:51] How they dance, how they sing, how they
[53:55] dress. God is not there. Tail end
[54:02] despised place
[54:05] like the unwelcomed Christ.
[54:12] Christ was not welcome.
[54:14] They invited him.
[54:17] He going to he went their home
[54:20] but then they put him there in the
[54:21] corner
[54:23] with that feet
[54:25] not washed not anointed not wiped and
[54:30] they started criticizing it
[54:34] here
[54:36] overcharged with shating.
[54:40] So the Bible says
[54:42] as a snare
[54:47] it will come on all of them who dwell on
[54:51] the face of the earth
[54:56] as a snare.
[55:00] In other words, they have not prepared
[55:01] for it.
[55:04] They never hit the warning signs.
[55:08] It just shook them.
[55:14] But now the Bible says
[55:17] for us we are not children of the night.
[55:24] Let us go to 1 Thessalonians 5:4
[55:35] and then verse 4.
[55:39] But Brethren
[55:41] are not in darkness.
[55:44] We are not in darkness.
[55:47] What makes us to be in the light?
[55:50] We've heard the midnight cry.
[55:53] Praise the name of our Lord. We've heard
[55:55] a shout
[55:57] and God has been so gracious
[56:00] that he gave brother Brham the signs of
[56:02] the
[56:04] vision. The other vision. The other
[56:07] vision. We are not in darkness.
[56:11] We know where we stand.
[56:13] We know the time of the night. We know
[56:16] the hour we are living in. So the Bible
[56:19] says, "But you, brethren,
[56:22] are not in darkness."
[56:25] So if you are not in darkness, then the
[56:28] day should not take us as a thief in the
[56:30] night.
[56:33] What do you do? You make preparations.
[56:37] Make sure you're trimming your lamp.
[56:39] Make sure you're filled with the oil.
[56:42] Make sure you're living the life of
[56:43] Jesus Christ.
[56:45] Why? We've heard the midnight cry, the
[56:49] message of the hour. Praise the name of
[56:52] our Lord. You are all the children of
[56:54] the light
[56:56] and the children of the day.
[56:58] We are not of the night
[57:03] nor are of darkness.
[57:06] Therefore, let us not sleep
[57:12] as others do.
[57:15] You know when you are sleeping,
[57:18] you're not active.
[57:21] Now ask yourself, what activity are you
[57:23] in the kingdom of God?
[57:26] If you're not doing anything in the
[57:28] kingdom of God,
[57:30] you're in slumber.
[57:34] Find out where is your use in the
[57:37] kingdom.
[57:39] When you are sleeping, you're not doing
[57:41] anything.
[57:43] Then he says, "But let us watch and be
[57:47] sober."
[57:52] Watch
[57:55] like Elisha was told, "If you see me."
[58:01] So Elisha
[58:03] made sure that his eyes are on Elijah.
[58:08] Even our eyes should be on the Elijah.
[58:12] We have a prophet in the land. Praise
[58:15] the name of our Lord. Our eyes should be
[58:18] on the message.
[58:20] What does the message say about this
[58:21] thing? What does the message say about
[58:23] this? What does the message say about
[58:25] this? You hear about unions?
[58:32] Then you know what does the message talk
[58:33] about this union?
[58:37] The image of the beast. What does the
[58:39] Bible talk about the image of the beast?
[58:43] All that will worship the image of the
[58:45] beast,
[58:47] they end up in the lake of fire.
[58:50] So you are watching,
[58:53] you are seeing the move,
[58:55] you are seeing how things are moving
[58:58] and you know what decisions to make
[59:01] because you're not asleep.
[59:04] You are saying and he says be sober,
[59:10] know what decision to make
[59:13] because you have to watch
[59:16] to know what is happening.
[59:19] And to know what is happening,
[59:22] we use the word of God
[59:25] to discern the times that we are living
[59:27] in.
[59:28] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[59:30] the Bible says, "For they that sleep
[59:32] sleep in the night,
[59:35] and they that be drunken are drunken in
[59:37] the night.
[59:40] But let us
[59:42] who are of the day.
[59:46] Praise the name of our Lord. We are of
[59:48] the day.
[59:50] We are of the day.
[59:52] The message of the hour. The light has
[59:55] come our way.
[59:57] So we are in daylight
[1:00:00] because of we have heard the cry.
[1:00:03] We know what's going on. We know the
[1:00:06] season we are living in. So we are not
[1:00:08] going to be taken unawares.
[1:00:11] We know where we stand.
[1:00:14] So he says we are of the day.
[1:00:17] We are of the message. We have heard the
[1:00:20] shout
[1:00:22] Christ crying out. Behold the bl the
[1:00:25] bridegroom coming.
[1:00:28] So what do we need to do? He says be
[1:00:31] sober.
[1:00:33] Putting on the breastplate of faith.
[1:00:38] and love and of unhelmet,
[1:00:43] the hope of salvation.
[1:00:46] For God has not appointed us to rest,
[1:00:54] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:00:56] Jesus Christ
[1:01:00] who died for us.
[1:01:03] Whether we wake
[1:01:06] or sleep,
[1:01:08] we should live together with him.
[1:01:13] It says whether we wake
[1:01:16] In other words, when we are still alive
[1:01:18] in this body,
[1:01:20] we live together with him. When we
[1:01:22] sleep, in other words, die, the body is
[1:01:26] put in the grave. You still live with
[1:01:28] Christ.
[1:01:30] Praise the name of our Lord. He said we
[1:01:32] are of the dead.
[1:01:34] So, we need to be sober
[1:01:37] and watching. Praise the name of our
[1:01:39] Lord. Luke 21:36.
[1:01:44] The Bible says, "Watch ye therefore
[1:01:49] and watch ye therefore
[1:01:52] and pray always
[1:01:56] that you may not that you may be
[1:01:58] accounted worthy to escape.
[1:02:05] all these things that shall come to pass
[1:02:10] and to stand before the son of man.
[1:02:15] The Bible says watch
[1:02:20] pray.
[1:02:22] How do you watch?
[1:02:24] Look in the mirror of the word,
[1:02:26] not the season.
[1:02:29] What does brother Brandham talk about
[1:02:30] this?
[1:02:32] Praise the name of our Lord. much like
[1:02:36] you know 1954,
[1:02:39] brother Brandham prophesied
[1:02:41] that there will be a pope coming from
[1:02:43] America,
[1:02:45] the USA
[1:02:47] who will bring all the world to
[1:02:51] the image to cause all the religions
[1:02:53] unite.
[1:02:56] And
[1:02:57] just this recently
[1:03:00] the current pope
[1:03:02] has appointed the the cardinal in
[1:03:05] Jerusalem
[1:03:08] to be part of that interreligious
[1:03:10] committee in Vatican
[1:03:15] and then he appointed another one in
[1:03:18] Iran
[1:03:20] you know strategic
[1:03:23] the one in Jerusalem.
[1:03:26] to bring the the Judaism,
[1:03:31] the religious the Jewish religion.
[1:03:35] Then the one in Iran to bring the
[1:03:38] Islamic
[1:03:40] to bring them together smart,
[1:03:44] put everything together.
[1:03:48] What season are we living in? Praise the
[1:03:51] name of our Lord. So he says watch
[1:03:54] these things that are happening
[1:03:57] the economies of the world tumbling.
[1:04:01] They have to do that
[1:04:04] so that the beast
[1:04:07] can come out to redeem the earth.
[1:04:14] I have the money
[1:04:17] and everybody just bows down
[1:04:21] because how will the beast talk talk
[1:04:24] about economics
[1:04:27] if the economies have not failed?
[1:04:31] How will they talk about them? But then
[1:04:33] you see all the big countries
[1:04:37] they don't have enough money to sustain
[1:04:38] their budget.
[1:04:41] Continuous debts. continuous,
[1:04:44] continuous, continuous until the thing
[1:04:47] cannot operate nor
[1:04:50] and then the prophecy had to come to
[1:04:52] pass.
[1:04:54] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[1:04:55] Bible says, "Watch ye therefore
[1:04:59] and pray always.
[1:05:02] When you see what's happening,
[1:05:05] you keep on trimming your L. Lord, help
[1:05:08] me to be ready.
[1:05:10] Lord, give me grace so that you don't
[1:05:13] allow things take you away from God.
[1:05:16] Don't allow anything to stand between
[1:05:18] you and God.
[1:05:21] See that you hear the message.
[1:05:24] You observe the message.
[1:05:26] You know, you obey the message. You
[1:05:29] testify about the message and you pray
[1:05:32] to the Lord. The way Christ was telling
[1:05:35] them that when you see the abomination
[1:05:39] standing in the holy place,
[1:05:42] he said, "Let he that is in the
[1:05:44] mountain,
[1:05:46] let him not come to the city. Let him
[1:05:49] that's on the roof not go back to his
[1:05:51] house to pick anything."
[1:05:54] He said, "Take your flight."
[1:05:57] And then he said,
[1:05:59] pray for your flight.
[1:06:04] And he said, "Pray
[1:06:07] that your flight is not in winter.
[1:06:12] Your flight is not on the Sabbath. Then
[1:06:16] in the winter, because the mountains are
[1:06:18] full of snow,
[1:06:20] you can't survive in that environment.
[1:06:23] On Sabbath, the gates of the city are
[1:06:26] closed.
[1:06:28] He said, "Pray for your flight."
[1:06:31] We also need to pray
[1:06:33] for our flight. Praise the name of our
[1:06:36] Lord. Pray. Lord, count me worthy to be
[1:06:40] in the rapture.
[1:06:42] Let me have enough oil.
[1:06:45] Let that not take me unaware.
[1:06:48] Let the dead in Christ
[1:06:51] when they appear. Let my eyes not be
[1:06:54] blind.
[1:06:56] Like Elijah when he was telling Elisha
[1:06:59] that if you see me being taken up
[1:07:03] then it will be to you. That means there
[1:07:06] was a possibility
[1:07:09] Elisha not to say
[1:07:13] praise the name of the Lord. There was a
[1:07:15] possibility and I believe when Jesus was
[1:07:19] being taken up in heaven,
[1:07:22] when you read in the book of Acts
[1:07:23] chapter one,
[1:07:25] they only saw Jesus. But the living
[1:07:29] dead, those who had resurrected,
[1:07:32] they were following Christ together.
[1:07:35] Praise the name of our Lord. But they
[1:07:37] couldn't see them.
[1:07:39] But now, praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:07:42] need to see those people who are
[1:07:43] resurrected.
[1:07:46] and living among the stars and then it
[1:07:49] motivates us
[1:07:52] to know any time we also taking our
[1:07:56] flag. Praise the name of our Lord. We
[1:07:59] need to watch and pray.
[1:08:02] Praise the name of our Lord and let us
[1:08:04] not take anything for granted.
[1:08:11] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:08:12] message watchman
[1:08:16] what of the night
[1:08:19] therefore
[1:08:20] I feel that the great Holy Spirit today
[1:08:25] is the same watchman
[1:08:29] that was in the tower at the beginning.
[1:08:34] He is still the warning voice.
[1:08:39] Prepare to meet thy God.
[1:08:43] Praise the name of our Lord. He says,
[1:08:45] "Now the Holy Spirit
[1:08:48] is the watchman.
[1:08:51] Be ready."
[1:08:53] Praise the name of our Lord. The coming
[1:08:55] of the Lord is at hand.
[1:08:58] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:09:00] here
[1:09:02] it says
[1:09:06] the watchman in the Old Testament
[1:09:10] was the man that went up to a tower on a
[1:09:12] city
[1:09:15] way high. He was higher than all the
[1:09:18] footmen.
[1:09:21] It was his position.
[1:09:25] Now, in order for this man to get up
[1:09:28] there,
[1:09:30] he must have had a good clear
[1:09:32] understanding
[1:09:35] and he must have had good eyes.
[1:09:39] He must be alert.
[1:09:43] He must know the stars
[1:09:47] and many qualifications that before
[1:09:49] before he could be a correct watchman.
[1:09:54] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:09:56] says in the Bible his prophets
[1:10:01] were considered eagles.
[1:10:06] It could climb higher than any other
[1:10:08] bird.
[1:10:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[1:10:13] Spirit is our watchman and the Holy
[1:10:17] Spirit has appointed a prophet in our
[1:10:20] day.
[1:10:22] who was the watchman
[1:10:25] looking high.
[1:10:27] Praise the name of the Lord. He saw
[1:10:30] Russia burning America
[1:10:33] in 1933.
[1:10:35] That is a watchman. He would see far
[1:10:39] and when he sees far then he comes and
[1:10:41] gives us
[1:10:43] praise the name of Allah. Now it will be
[1:10:47] very unfortunate
[1:10:50] when we are footmen down here on earth
[1:10:53] and somebody's eyes looking ahead.
[1:10:58] When he tells you what to do, you're not
[1:11:00] seeing right.
[1:11:02] So you're not seeing right.
[1:11:05] Ah, this life is enjoyable.
[1:11:08] I'm still young.
[1:11:10] I'm still young. I have more time.
[1:11:14] then you'll be taken unawares.
[1:11:17] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[1:11:19] watchman,
[1:11:21] he warns us. We have the message of the
[1:11:24] hour.
[1:11:26] Let us take heed to the message.
[1:11:29] What the message is telling us.
[1:11:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Now,
[1:11:34] there's a a testimony here of a girl who
[1:11:38] turned down her last call
[1:11:43] in the message
[1:11:45] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:11:47] the enemy.
[1:11:50] Praise the name of our Lord. He says, "I
[1:11:53] spoke to a girl when I was yet a Baptist
[1:11:56] preacher.
[1:11:58] I was down in Nashville, Tennessee,
[1:12:02] Tennessee, and I felt le to tell her
[1:12:07] and I believed God was giving her
[1:12:12] her final call.
[1:12:15] She met me outside the church that night
[1:12:18] and she said, "Don't you never embarrass
[1:12:22] me like that again.
[1:12:29] said, "I never embarrassed you. I hope
[1:12:33] not."
[1:12:36] She was a deacon's daughter.
[1:12:39] She said, "I'm young and I've got plenty
[1:12:43] of time to pray."
[1:12:46] I say, "Lady, I wouldn't never pointed
[1:12:50] my finger to you
[1:12:53] if I didn't feel that way. It was right.
[1:12:57] never would make never would have made
[1:12:59] an altar call
[1:13:02] if I didn't think and he just bowed out
[1:13:06] at me terribly.
[1:13:12] And two years later,
[1:13:14] I was there with my old friend, brother
[1:13:18] Morrison,
[1:13:22] the Baptist church,
[1:13:24] have another meeting.
[1:13:26] And when I did, I walked down the street
[1:13:31] and she was a nice young lady.
[1:13:34] She was walking down the street.
[1:13:38] It has been about 25 years ago.
[1:13:41] and her underneath skirts hanging low.
[1:13:50] How f she looked.
[1:13:53] I thought that can't be the deacon's
[1:13:56] daughter.
[1:13:57] And she spied me.
[1:14:00] She kind of smiled and turned her head
[1:14:03] sideways.
[1:14:07] I walked over close to her.
[1:14:10] She said, "Hello, preacher."
[1:14:12] I said, "How do you do?" She stood there
[1:14:16] on the corner a little bit and said,
[1:14:19] "Come, go with me to my room."
[1:14:22] I said, "Thank you. I'm kind of letting
[1:14:25] me hurry. She reached in her pocket book
[1:14:31] and said, "Have a cigarette."
[1:14:34] I said, "Now, aren't you ashamed to say
[1:14:37] that?
[1:14:39] He said, "Maybe you would take a drink
[1:14:41] with me.
[1:14:43] I'll pay for it if you'll take it."
[1:14:47] I said, "Shame on you, lady.
[1:14:49] Wouldn't you be ashamed to ask a servant
[1:14:51] of Christ
[1:14:54] saying like that?"
[1:14:56] I started to walk away.
[1:14:59] I said, "I'll be praying for you." She
[1:15:03] said, "Just a minute.
[1:15:06] There is no need.
[1:15:08] I said, "Why?" She said, "You remember
[1:15:12] that night
[1:15:13] standing there by that rose bushy
[1:15:19] by the side of the Baptist church."
[1:15:22] I said, "Yes." And she said, "My father
[1:15:26] is still a deacon there.
[1:15:29] You can tell this wherever you want to
[1:15:31] go
[1:15:33] if you want to." She said that was my
[1:15:38] last call.
[1:15:42] You know, since that time,
[1:15:45] I used always to feel a calling in my
[1:15:47] heart
[1:15:49] to come to God. But since that time,
[1:15:53] I've got harder and harder.
[1:16:03] Now this is the statement the girl made.
[1:16:08] She said, "My heart is so hard against
[1:16:11] God
[1:16:15] and against the church and everything."
[1:16:19] And said, "I could see my own mother's
[1:16:22] soul
[1:16:27] fly in hell like a pancake.
[1:16:37] and I laugh at it.
[1:16:40] That's how bad it was. She had her last
[1:16:44] call,
[1:16:46] but she put it off. This is not the
[1:16:49] time. I still need more time. You know,
[1:16:52] like some people get saved says, "Ah,
[1:16:55] I'm still young. I'll get saved when I
[1:16:58] get old."
[1:17:01] And but that could be the last call. And
[1:17:03] like even this girl, she lost out.
[1:17:08] No more conviction in her heart.
[1:17:11] No more thirsting for God.
[1:17:14] No more hungering for God.
[1:17:18] And so brother Brandham says, I think
[1:17:20] let me pick up also this.
[1:17:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:17:26] to this message.
[1:17:29] something I've just remembered. I just
[1:17:30] need to read it.
[1:17:33] He says in the message, "Christ is the
[1:17:35] mystery of God revealed.
[1:17:38] But all this mystery
[1:17:41] is revealed only
[1:17:46] as he promised
[1:17:48] to his bride.
[1:17:51] Hell is against this truth
[1:17:56] of the revelation of this mystery.
[1:17:59] But the bride
[1:18:01] is standing on it.
[1:18:05] That is her stand.
[1:18:08] This is why I wanted paragraph 504.
[1:18:12] It says, "Why do you hunger church?
[1:18:16] Why do you thirst?
[1:18:19] It is the father trying to reveal to you
[1:18:26] these hidden secrets to you.
[1:18:30] But you let so many things get it out of
[1:18:33] you.
[1:18:36] You let your job,
[1:18:38] you let your wife, you let your husband,
[1:18:42] you let your children, you let the cares
[1:18:45] of the world,
[1:18:47] you let some pastor,
[1:18:50] you let somebody else
[1:18:52] get that out of you.
[1:18:56] When you know that when down in your
[1:19:00] heart
[1:19:01] you are thirsting,
[1:19:04] you are hungry.
[1:19:06] It is God trying to reveal it to you.
[1:19:10] The revelation, the last day is here.
[1:19:15] Praise the name of our Lord. So when God
[1:19:17] puts that thirsting,
[1:19:20] that hungering
[1:19:21] like you start thinking about something
[1:19:23] of God,
[1:19:26] don't disrupt it.
[1:19:28] Are you going into this way? Going to
[1:19:30] the other way. Take time and meditate
[1:19:33] upon the word. Take time and pray.
[1:19:37] Take time and read. Father, what does
[1:19:40] the Lord want to reveal to me?
[1:19:43] What does the Lord want to reveal to me?
[1:19:46] How does the Lord want me to go?
[1:19:49] It's the spirit of Christ coming down as
[1:19:53] the watchman
[1:19:55] sometimes warning you about what's going
[1:19:57] to happen.
[1:20:00] Sometimes guiding you, how you handle
[1:20:02] the affairs of your life, how you handle
[1:20:05] the affairs of your family, how you
[1:20:08] handle the affairs at your place of
[1:20:09] work.
[1:20:11] Praise the name of our Lord. So we had a
[1:20:13] watchman,
[1:20:16] you know, he watches over us. Praise the
[1:20:19] name of God. He knows what lays ahead of
[1:20:21] us. The midnight cry. We have heard the
[1:20:26] midnight cry.
[1:20:28] And as we've heard the midnight cry,
[1:20:31] he says, "Behold the bridegroom coming."
[1:20:36] What do you do? Arise.
[1:20:39] How many of us have already arisen?
[1:20:42] How many of us are awake?
[1:20:45] You know, be awake.
[1:20:48] Don't allow to slumber at this time.
[1:20:52] Don't allow your job to make you
[1:20:53] slumber.
[1:20:56] Don't allow your family to make you
[1:20:57] slumber.
[1:20:59] Don't allow all your programs to make
[1:21:00] you slumber.
[1:21:03] Because the Bible says it comes in an
[1:21:05] hour you think not.
[1:21:09] But he wants us to be ready.
[1:21:11] If it happens today, be ready. It
[1:21:15] happens tomorrow, be ready. Praise the
[1:21:18] name of our Lord. I'm ready to move.
[1:21:21] Praise the name of Allah. I'm ready to
[1:21:23] be raptured.
[1:21:25] I'm ready to be changed. Praise the name
[1:21:27] of our Lord. The midnight cry is the
[1:21:31] message of the hour. Is the shout we
[1:21:33] have received.
[1:21:36] And by the time the message comes forth,
[1:21:40] he's right away
[1:21:42] any time is here. Praise the name of let
[1:21:45] us be ready. May God bless you.
[1:21:49] Amen.
[1:21:50] [Applause]
[1:21:56] Let us sing that song in the
[1:21:58] resurrection morning.
[1:22:03] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:22:08] In the resurrection
[1:22:11] morning when the trumpet of God shall
[1:22:14] round, we shall rise.
[1:22:18] Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:22:23] Then the saints will come rejoicing and
[1:22:27] no tears will be found. We shall rise.
[1:22:33] Hallelujah. We shall rise. Amen.
[1:22:38] We shall rise.
[1:22:42] We shall rise.
[1:22:46] We shall rise.
[1:22:48] Hallelujah. In the
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:57] We shall rise.
[1:23:01] We shall rise.
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:05] In the resurrection
[1:23:07] morning, what a meeting it will be. We
[1:23:13] shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise
[1:23:20] when our fathers and our mothers and our
[1:23:25] loved ones we shall see. We shall rise.
[1:23:30] Halleluah.
[1:23:32] We shall in the resurrection morning. In
[1:23:36] the resurrection
[1:23:39] morning, blessed thought is to me. We
[1:23:44] shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:23:52] I shall see my blessed savior who so
[1:23:57] freely died for me. We shall rise.
[1:24:02] Hallelujah. We shall rise. Amen.
[1:24:08] We shall rise.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah. We shall rise. Amen.
[1:24:16] We shall rise.
[1:24:18] Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] In the resurrection
[1:24:23] morning. When the death prison bars are
[1:24:27] broken, we shall rise.
[1:24:30] Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] We shall arise
[1:24:36] in the resurrection
[1:24:39] morning. We shall meet him in the air.
[1:24:44] We shall rise.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah. We shall and be carried up.
[1:24:52] and be carried out to glory to our home.
[1:25:00] We shall rise.
[1:25:02] Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] We shall rise. We shall rise. We shall
[1:25:09] rise.
[1:25:11] Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:25:16] We shall rise.
[1:25:18] Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] In the resurrection
[1:25:23] morning when the death prisons are
[1:25:27] falling we shall rise.
[1:25:31] Hallelujah. We shall rise.
[1:25:35] Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] Do you believe it?
[1:25:40] Let us sing that song.
[1:25:44] Midnight cry.
[1:25:48] When Jesus
[1:25:50] steps out, let's get a lower key.
[1:25:55] When Jesus
[1:25:57] steps out
[1:26:02] on cloud to call God's children,
[1:26:08] the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:26:14] to meet him in the air.
[1:26:22] And then those that remain, those that

[1:39:21] under the teaching of the word to say
[1:39:24] Lord Jesus where there is errors in our

[1:40:31] you, Jesus, for the reach of mercies."
[1:40:34] And the prophet says, we cannot exhaust
[1:40:37] the spirit of God. May you pour yourself
[1:40:39] in us, Lord. As we come before you, Lord
[1:40:42] Jesus. And as we wait, Father, for that

[1:47:07] to him. My home
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] sing.
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:20] [Applause]
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:33] Amen. Let us stand up our Bibles
[1:47:38] in First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:47:44] We are reading from verse 23.
[1:47:49] Up to verse 28.
[1:47:53] He says, "For I have received of the
[1:47:56] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:47:58] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:48:01] in which he was betrayed took bread.
[1:48:13] for God. And when he had given thanks,
[1:48:16] he broke it and said, "Take it. This is
[1:48:20] my body which is broken for you. This do
[1:48:23] in remembrance of me.
[1:48:38] After the same manner also he took the
[1:48:40] cup when he had sapped, saying, "This
[1:48:43] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:48:46] This do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:48:49] remembrance of me.
[1:49:03] For as often as you eat this bread and
[1:49:06] drink this cup, you do show the Lord his
[1:49:08] death till he come.
[1:49:19] Wherefore soever shall eat of this bread
[1:49:21] and drink of this cup of the Lord
[1:49:23] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:49:26] and the blood of the Lord.
[1:49:39] But let a man examine himself, and so
[1:49:42] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:49:45] that cup.
[1:49:55] So the Bible says we examine ourselves.
[1:50:00] Praise the name of our Lord. We know our
[1:50:03] works.
[1:50:05] And then the scripture says when we eat
[1:50:08] of this bread
[1:50:10] and drink of this cup, we are declaring
[1:50:14] that the Lord Jesus died
[1:50:17] and he resurrected us again.
[1:50:19] And what took him to die
[1:50:22] was because of our unworthiness.
[1:50:25] Praise the name of our Lord. On our own
[1:50:27] we are not worthy.
[1:50:29] So whatever our failures are, whatever
[1:50:32] our weaknesses are, we bring them right
[1:50:35] under the blood of Jesus.
[1:50:38] And then you ask God for mercy.
[1:50:41] Lord help me in my trespasses.
[1:50:44] Lord help me in my straying out
[1:50:47] and restore me back into the fellowship.
[1:50:51] Let us pray. Father, in the name of
[1:50:53] Jesus Christ,
[1:50:55] we approach your presence again
[1:50:58] as we've come to observe this Lord
[1:51:00] supper
[1:51:02] which you commanded us heavenly father
[1:51:05] that we should do it as often as we can
[1:51:09] in remembrance of your death and
[1:51:11] resurrection.
[1:51:13] We are here having the unleven bread.
[1:51:18] Father, we pray may sanctify this bread
[1:51:22] Lord, as we partake of it,
[1:51:24] a sign of the body of Jesus Christ to
[1:51:28] know that we are the body of Christ.
[1:51:31] We are part of the word of God.
[1:51:34] We pray that father be able to enjoy all
[1:51:37] the benefits
[1:51:39] that comes from obedience to your word.
[1:51:42] As we doing it in a physical way,
[1:51:45] yet we know spiritually also. Father, we
[1:51:49] commune with you, Lord.
[1:51:51] We pray may bless every one of us
[1:51:54] and guide in the whole process heavenly
[1:51:56] father in the breaking of bread
[1:52:00] in the serving of wine and even in the
[1:52:02] foot washing and even law that all may
[1:52:06] be done for the glor of your holy name.
[1:52:08] Bless us as we wait on you in the name
[1:52:12] of the Lord Jesus pray this. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:16] You may be seated.
[1:52:18] I would call brother William and brother
[1:52:20] Wilson.
