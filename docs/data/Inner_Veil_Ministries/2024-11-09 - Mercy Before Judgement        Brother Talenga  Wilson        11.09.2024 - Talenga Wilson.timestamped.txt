[40:55] 12 amen amen
[40:59] and the scripture
[41:01] says and the man said unto
[41:04] Lord thou hear any besides sonin-law and
[41:09] thy sons and thy daughters and
[41:12] whatsoever thou Hast in the city bring
[41:14] them out of this place
[41:35] for we will destroy this place because
[41:38] the Cry of them is works and great
[41:40] before the face of the Lord and the Lord
[41:42] has senty
[41:58] and when the morning arose and the
[42:00] angels HED lot saying arise take thy
[42:04] wife and thy two daughters which are
[42:07] here lest thou be consumed in the
[42:09] iniquity of the city
[42:29] and while he lingered the man laid hold
[42:32] upon his hand and upon the hand of his
[42:35] wife and upon the hand of his two
[42:37] daughters the Lord being merciful unto
[42:39] him and they brought him forth and set
[42:43] him without
[43:03] and it came to pass when they had
[43:05] brought them forth abroad that he said
[43:08] Escape for thy life look not behind thee
[43:11] neither stay thou in all thee escap the
[43:15] M Beed
[43:33] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[43:36] words take our
[43:38] seats amen so I want to welcome you to
[43:42] the to the to our stud
[43:46] tonight
[43:48] for I'll be teaching all preaching or
[43:52] talking about Mery before judgment
[44:05] praise the Lord so we know the Bible
[44:08] teaches
[44:09] us that each time God is going send out
[44:14] something either it's a
[44:17] punishment or it's a
[44:19] plague praise the Lord he normally first
[44:22] of all sends a
[44:25] messenger to wonder people
[44:28] of the oncoming
[44:30] plague praise the Lord so he first of
[44:32] all shows Mercy to the
[44:35] people and he gives them a way of
[44:39] Escape before the plague
[44:42] hits so now here the angel that God had
[44:45] sent
[44:47] lot the city was going to be
[44:50] bured the whole city was going to be
[44:54] burned praise the Lord was going to be
[44:58] judged praise the Lord and this judgment
[45:01] was going to be by
[45:04] fire but before it was
[45:06] burned there was a people that God had
[45:10] seen praise the Lord that the Angels
[45:14] first visited
[45:16] Abraham praise the Lord and then they
[45:19] left Abraham the other
[45:20] side and then the angel came to lot to
[45:24] warn lot of what was going to happen to
[45:26] the
[45:29] praise the Lord show him
[45:32] Mercy praise the Lord when the angel
[45:34] came to Lord the Bible say the asked
[45:38] Lord don't you have any other person
[45:42] besides don't you have a sonin-law
[45:45] or don't you have sons or don't you have
[45:49] daughters or
[45:51] whatsoever that you have in the city
[45:54] bring them out of this place
[45:58] for we will destroy this place because
[46:00] the Cry of them is works and great
[46:02] before
[46:06] God and he sent us to destroy it so we
[46:10] know that Sodom and
[46:12] gor were in a Sodom
[46:15] condition and the people had committed
[46:19] sin and it had annoyed God and so God
[46:23] was to bring judgment Upon This City
[46:27] because of its
[46:29] wickedness praise the Lord but before he
[46:32] did it here is the Angel of the
[46:35] Lord and the angel of the Lord bringing
[46:38] caution to
[46:40] lot his house because there was only
[46:44] lot praise the Lord that God was coming
[46:47] to look out
[46:48] for to rescue from the
[46:51] city praise the Lord and the angel asked
[46:55] him do you have any other
[46:58] besides you praise the Lord why because
[47:02] the mercies of God were there with
[47:06] Lord God had brought Mercy before
[47:09] them so he was looking for anyone that
[47:12] was righteous before
[47:14] him was in the city so when he looked at
[47:18] lot and his
[47:19] house he asked him there was mer pres
[47:24] and God was ready to redeem
[47:27] to save
[47:29] anyone that accepted the mercies of God
[47:33] so he asked don't you have
[47:35] anyone why because the angel of the Lord
[47:40] had seen what was going before the
[47:43] city praise the Lord you have seen the
[47:46] events that we are going to
[47:48] happen that the city was going to be
[47:51] burned the Bible says when the morning
[47:55] arose the angels H and
[48:01] lot because lot was
[48:05] lingering the Lord so they they
[48:08] HED saying arise take thy
[48:12] wife and your
[48:14] daughters which are here lest you be
[48:16] consumed in the iniquity of the
[48:20] city and still Lord was
[48:23] lingering and was a call
[48:27] call for
[48:28] deliverance to deliver him out of the
[48:31] iniquity deliver him out of the city
[48:34] because it was going to be
[48:37] judged by fire of the Lord and says
[48:40] while he
[48:42] lingered the man laid hold upon his
[48:46] hand praise the Lord he was lingering
[48:49] and yet the purpose of
[48:51] God message that the Angels had carried
[48:57] the message was to deliver
[48:59] lot and his house out of the
[49:02] city before judgment
[49:05] struck and the Bible says got a hold of
[49:09] his hand and upon his wife and upon his
[49:13] two
[49:14] daughters and the Lord being merciful
[49:17] unto
[49:19] him they brought him forth and set him
[49:24] without the
[49:25] city and it came to pass where they had
[49:28] brought them forth
[49:31] abroad that he said Escape for your
[49:35] life that was the
[49:38] message to escape for his
[49:40] life because judgment was going to
[49:43] strike the
[49:45] land and that is our God he such a
[49:49] merciful god praise the lord we shall
[49:53] see in the Bible
[49:55] History each time is going to judge the
[49:58] land is going to judge the
[50:01] people first of all sends a
[50:04] message praise the Lord a message to
[50:07] wonder people to call them to
[50:11] attention to tell them of the oncoming

[50:19] Deliverance deliver them before the
[50:22] Striking of the
[50:24] Judgment praise the Lord he sent the
[50:27] message to Lord to redeem him out don't
[50:31] come out because the city is going to be
[50:35] burn praise the Lord he has always given
[50:39] himself to the
[50:40] people he always opens himself out the
[50:44] people send his
[50:46] word full
[50:48] ofcy full of grace full of love to
[50:52] rescue the people to redeem them from
[50:55] the oncoming judgment
[50:58] praise the Lord and he makes
[51:00] sure that when he sends this
[51:03] message when he send the word of the
[51:07] word must reach every
[51:09] part praise the Lord if God has
[51:13] desire to save
[51:16] Ginger from maybe an event that is
[51:19] coming to strike
[51:21] Ginger first of all sends a
[51:23] message to Ginger
[51:26] makes sure that everyone in
[51:29] ginger hears this message praise the
[51:33] Lord that when judgment
[51:36] hits there is no
[51:39] excuse praise the Lord so when he sent
[51:41] the message and the angels reached the
[51:44] household of of
[51:46] lot they looked around lot and asked lot
[51:51] don't you have any other person besides
[51:54] your daughters don't you have
[51:57] Sons or don't you have sons
[52:00] inw or other
[52:02] person why because the message had been
[52:07] sent to rescue
[52:10] lot from the Judgment that was coming to
[52:13] strike the
[52:14] city praise the Lord and God promised us
[52:19] in the Book of
[52:20] Joel 2 verse
[52:22] 28 it says and it shall come to pass
[52:26] that
[52:27] afterwards I will pour out my spirit
[52:30] upon All

[52:35] your
[52:36] daughters
[52:38] prophesy your old men shall dream
[52:41] dreams your young men shall see
[52:44] Visions praise the Lord I don't mean the
[52:47] prophets all the prophecies that we see
[52:51] everywhere but the
[52:53] prophecies that the Bible talks of here
[52:56] the
[52:58] Declaration of the word of God
[53:02] Declaration of Mercy Declaration of
[53:06] Deliverance and judgments that would
[53:09] strike the Earth praise the Lord the
[53:12] spirit of
[53:14] Prophecy in other words that would be
[53:17] poured upon the people is the
[53:19] Declaration of a
[53:21] message of
[53:23] Deliverance to deliver the people of the
[53:26] oncoming
[53:27] judgment it's a declaration of the
[53:30] message of
[53:31] Grace praise the Lord that by
[53:35] faith and divine
[53:38] intervention to whom the message is
[53:41] sent they be able to receive it and save
[53:47] themselves from the Judgment that would
[53:50] strike
[53:51] the and this message the Declaration of
[53:56] the
[53:58] would be to call out the
[54:00] people
[54:02] toy call out the people towards Grace to
[54:07] call out the people towards Deliverance
[54:10] to call out the people onto Christ
[54:14] praise the Lord before
[54:16] judgment there is always a mer
[54:20] call the Ang said askap for your
[54:23] life praise the Lord for life when he
[54:28] was speaking to him says
[54:30] Escape do not
[54:32] delay why because the angel had gone
[54:35] ahead of
[54:36] time the
[54:38] messenger that God has sent
[54:42] lot had gone ahead of
[54:45] time and was able to see the
[54:48] things that we are to be was able to see
[54:51] the fire and the judgments that they are
[54:55] coming upon the
[54:58] and Lord was
[54:59] lingering he had the voice he had the
[55:03] caution he was L the Bible says because
[55:08] he was the
[55:10] elect the angel that was going to cause
[55:14] judgment that was going to bring
[55:16] fire do nothing without he couldn't do
[55:22] anything without Lord so as Lord was
[55:25] lingering
[55:27] because L was the
[55:28] elect in the city the Bible says the
[55:33] angel brought a hold of his hand and
[55:36] began pulling him all through and took
[55:38] him out of the city praise the Lord God
[55:41] is very
[55:43] Just Praise the Lord if you sent out a
[55:46] message if you sent out message of
[55:50] Deliverance he makes sure that that
[55:53] message reaches out to the people
[55:57] who have been ordained to be
[55:58] theer praise the Lord regardless of of L
[56:04] laziness when he looked back and he saw
[56:07] his
[56:08] wealth praise the Lord he was a rich man
[56:11] and the prophet says he was the mayor of
[56:13] the
[56:14] city so he could sit in the gates and he
[56:17] could could watch over things that were
[56:19] coming in into the
[56:21] City and things that were going out of
[56:23] the city he was in charge of everything
[56:27] that was coming to the city so when he
[56:30] had the message praise the Lord and he
[56:33] was now delaying he was looking at his
[56:36] wealth how will I live my wealth there
[56:40] are things that we are touching him were
[56:43] those
[56:44] attachments that were stopping him when
[56:47] the message of caution came to
[56:49] us maybe he said I will change tomorrow
[56:54] iust tomorrow I'll do this tomorrow give
[56:58] me a little bit of time praise the Lord
[57:01] he was looking at his wealth he wanted
[57:04] to take a part of it with but when the
[57:07] angel looked at him and he saw that lot
[57:11] was
[57:12] lingering praise the Lord because this
[57:15] message had been sent specifically to
[57:17] his
[57:18] household the angel got a hold of him
[57:22] and they Dred him out of the city why
[57:25] because L had not come into that
[57:29] continence praise the lord of the things
[57:32] that you going to come to pass and yet
[57:34] the angel has seen the fire the angel
[57:39] has seen the judgments praise the Lord
[57:42] and in the hands of the
[57:43] Angels was
[57:45] mercy and lot praise the Lord he
[57:50] lingered praise the Lord he was looking
[57:52] around he did not attach much value
[57:58] to the
[57:59] message that the Angels had
[58:02] brought because the purpose of God was
[58:06] Deliverance of God to deliver him to
[58:11] redeem him out of the
[58:13] city God did it by
[58:16] force why because the time was at
[58:20] hand the message had been preached and
[58:23] he had the message he was delaying and
[58:28] God used
[58:30] Force to take him out of the city in
[58:34] order to deliver
[58:35] him that's how merciful he
[58:38] is the B has said because God is
[58:43] merciful because of his
[58:46] mercies he had to drag him out the Lord
[58:50] being
[58:51] merciful they brought him forth and set
[58:55] him without the
[58:58] praise the Lord and the prophet says as
[59:01] it was in them days he said so will it
[59:04] be the message went forth and they
[59:08] merely laughed at it and mocked at it as
[59:12] someone who was telling some kind of
[59:15] idol
[59:18] Tale But it was of
[59:21] Mercy it was of Grace it was of
[59:24] Deliverance and Angel said that
[59:28] morning to lot after he would give the
[59:32] message he said
[59:34] H come here so I can do
[59:39] nothing till thou Hast come
[59:42] here praise the Lord God sends a message
[59:47] and he can do
[59:49] nothing the people have received that
[59:52] message and until Deliverance has come
[59:55] unto them
[59:57] praise the Lord says I can do
[1:00:01] nothing without you you must first come
[1:00:04] out of the city before I hit the seity
[1:00:07] with
[1:00:09] judgment
[1:00:11] call judgment
[1:00:13] strikes praise the Lord and he promised
[1:00:16] us that he would send us a prophet he
[1:00:21] would send us a message praise the Lord
[1:00:26] message would be
[1:00:30] specific
[1:00:32] specific to the end time
[1:00:35] right says I will send
[1:00:37] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:00:41] grateful of the
[1:00:43] Lord I send a message of
[1:00:46] Mercy I would send a message of
[1:00:49] Deliverance praise the Lord and this
[1:00:51] message had to be
[1:00:54] preached it has to be
[1:00:56] preached and it has to reach Every
[1:01:00] Soul that was ordained to be
[1:01:04] delivered praise the Lord because
[1:01:06] without us without that Soul without
[1:01:10] that bright praise the Lord God can do
[1:01:14] nothing to the
[1:01:16] Earth praise the Lord because he says
[1:01:19] I'll send elah the prophet before the
[1:01:22] great and grateful day of the Lord
[1:01:27] praise the Lord and that message of of
[1:01:29] of Malachi the message of that
[1:01:33] Elijah would be a message to be call to
[1:01:37] attention to turn the hearts of the
[1:01:40] children back to their
[1:01:42] fathers praise the Lord and until all
[1:01:46] children have received this message
[1:01:50] until all children have had this message
[1:01:53] a message of Deliverance
[1:01:56] a mercy
[1:01:57] call has nothing to do with this Earth
[1:02:01] because he says behold the day
[1:02:03] come that the Earth shall burn as an
[1:02:06] OV but it says before that day there
[1:02:11] must be a
[1:02:12] message a message of
[1:02:15] Deliverance praise the Lord to deliver
[1:02:18] us a message of
[1:02:20] Mercy that God will show us
[1:02:23] Mercy that means the hands of the
[1:02:31] Prophet age praise the Lord in the hands
[1:02:35] of Malachi 4 was the message of
[1:02:39] Grace Grace to this age Grace to You
[1:02:43] Grace to me to Deliver Us From The Storm
[1:02:47] that is coming to hit the
[1:02:49] earth praise the Lord and God had seen
[1:02:52] it and when he saw it gave it to the
[1:02:57] prophet and when the prophet came as we
[1:03:00] shall see the events of
[1:03:02] time praise the Lord he also went ahead
[1:03:05] of
[1:03:06] time like lot like the angel that came
[1:03:09] to lot
[1:03:10] did praise the Lord like Moses did when
[1:03:15] God had sent him to deliver the children
[1:03:17] of Israel when God sends a man he gets
[1:03:22] him and he takes him ahead of time to
[1:03:26] show him the things that are to
[1:03:28] be praise the Lord that when he comes
[1:03:31] back to speak a message he's speaking
[1:03:36] from experience he speaking from an
[1:03:39] informed point of
[1:03:41] view speak because he has had an
[1:03:44] experience with it so that when Moses
[1:03:47] comes down on the last day when God was
[1:03:51] going to strike the land of Egypt with a
[1:03:55] plague
[1:03:56] God speaks to Moses and he tells him go
[1:04:00] and tell the people tell them that on
[1:04:03] such and such a day I will vist the
[1:04:07] death angel shall vist the land
[1:04:09] of and all the
[1:04:11] firstborns shall be killed and then when
[1:04:15] he that was the
[1:04:16] Judgment that was going to come to the
[1:04:18] land
[1:04:19] of but before that
[1:04:22] judgment God gave a word of caution to
[1:04:24] Moses
[1:04:28] told him I will kill every
[1:04:32] first but before
[1:04:34] that this is the Mery
[1:04:37] call go and tell the people go and tell
[1:04:41] every househ to kill a lamb and then app
[1:04:44] the blood upon
[1:04:46] the praise the Lord that was the message
[1:04:49] of
[1:04:50] mercy and by so doing if the angel
[1:04:54] looked at the blood
[1:04:56] pass that household praise the Lord and
[1:04:59] now Moses came and gathered all the
[1:05:02] people told he told them on such and
[1:05:06] such a day at such and such a Time the
[1:05:09] death angel shall
[1:05:11] pass and all

[1:10:24] of them and that was his
[1:10:27] household they understood him they did
[1:10:30] not only understand him but they came
[1:10:33] into
[1:10:34] experience with the message that was

[1:11:06] obeyed the voice and went to the ark was
[1:11:10] rescued there is always
[1:11:12] Mery before judgment praise the Lord and
[1:11:16] in the times the B says I will pour my
[1:11:21] spirit upon All Flesh and there shall be
[1:11:24] prophetic
[1:11:26] declarations praise the Lord like I said
[1:11:30] not the prophecies that we
[1:11:32] see
[1:11:33] everywh praise the Lord but we are
[1:11:35] talking about
[1:11:38] declaring the word of God we talking
[1:11:42] about declaring the things that are to
[1:11:45] be praise the Lord and we we are
[1:11:48] thankful to God that before
[1:11:51] judgment God has sent us a prophet
[1:11:55] praise the Lord God has given us
[1:11:58] mercy God has sent us a prophet to
[1:12:01] restore our faith to restore us to the
[1:12:06] original what praise the Lord he has
[1:12:09] sent us a prophet and he has given him
[1:12:12] all the
[1:12:13] instruments he has showed him all the
[1:12:16] things that are to be praise the Lord he
[1:12:19] got a hold of him like he got Noah he
[1:12:23] got Moses he got a hold of him and he
[1:12:27] took him ahead of time and he began
[1:12:30] showing him all the
[1:12:33] things to be before the end of the world
[1:12:38] and he showed him everything and then he
[1:12:41] saw it he was convinced that the things
[1:12:45] shall come pass then he came and
[1:12:49] preached us the message praise the Lord
[1:12:52] he preached us
[1:12:53] message message
[1:12:56] 4 a message
[1:12:59] of bringing us into the words bringing
[1:13:02] us into Christ before the oncoming
[1:13:06] judgment he showed
[1:13:08] him when they hear and they welcome it
[1:13:12] they are
[1:13:13] guided they are
[1:13:15] Guided by the spirit of God in their day
[1:13:20] praise the Lord in the times of in the
[1:13:23] times of of Paul
[1:13:25] they were Guided by the spirit of God
[1:13:28] that was upon Paul praise the Lord and
[1:13:31] every messenger God gave them a message
[1:13:35] specific to their age praise the Lord
[1:13:38] and whoever had this
[1:13:40] message they got into the spirit of the
[1:13:43] messenger and they were Guided by the
[1:13:47] spirit that was upon their messenger and
[1:13:50] in this day praise the lord we are
[1:13:53] Guided by that
[1:13:55] spirit that was with Willam
[1:13:58] BR he's the
[1:14:00] messenger of our day praise the Lord so
[1:14:03] now when you receive the message it's
[1:14:06] nothing else but Jesus Christ then you
[1:14:09] welcome it in your heart and then you
[1:14:12] start a new
[1:14:13] part new Walk of Life the Holy Spirit
[1:14:17] and some here and turn
[1:14:21] away not news happened
[1:14:25] the days of Noah it happened the days of
[1:14:29] L it happened when Moses preached it
[1:14:33] happen when Paul preached Happ when all
[1:14:36] the messengers preach some shall hear
[1:14:39] this message but they shall turn
[1:14:43] away praise the Lord maybe they are too
[1:14:48] smart to listen and take action why
[1:14:52] because this
[1:14:53] message is all
[1:14:57] fashioned praise the Lord it keeps you
[1:14:59] old
[1:15:00] fashioned keeps
[1:15:03] simple keeps you humble praise the Lord
[1:15:06] it keeps you in the modest nature of the
[1:15:10] holy
[1:15:11] spirit so those that are
[1:15:14] smart they shall hear and they
[1:15:18] shall some believe that this message is
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:22] truth praise the Lord but they we have
[1:15:26] time praise the Lord one day I was
[1:15:30] hearing there's a preacher a charic
[1:15:33] preacher charismatic
[1:15:35] preacher I think is the preacher of the
[1:15:40] group preaching and he said there is a
[1:15:44] special man that God sent in this age
[1:15:48] and that man has a special message he
[1:15:51] had a special
[1:15:53] Spirit stand and he could look at you
[1:15:56] and tell you your thoughts where you
[1:15:59] come from what you at and everything
[1:16:02] about you and that man
[1:16:05] is a special man great prophet of the
[1:16:09] age but then he goes ahead to preach
[1:16:13] contrary what that man preached he knows
[1:16:17] that this
[1:16:19] manent of God he knows that he is a
[1:16:23] prophet to the ede
[1:16:25] but maybe because of a few
[1:16:28] factors cannot receive the
[1:16:32] call continues in their own way yet this
[1:16:36] message comes to wonder people praise
[1:16:40] the Lord that time is
[1:16:42] First and this message comes to position
[1:16:45] the
[1:16:47] people to position us into the word of
[1:16:51] God for our day and that makes the
[1:16:55] difference it's the message of the hour
[1:16:59] that makes the difference it makes the
[1:17:02] difference between you that have
[1:17:04] received it and the rest of the world
[1:17:08] why because when you receive this
[1:17:10] message you come into that prophetic
[1:17:14] eye you come into praise the Lord you
[1:17:17] are into a different state of
[1:17:21] life and the way you see things is
[1:17:24] different from from the the world
[1:17:26] sees much as we all
[1:17:29] profess we all confess Jesus Christ but
[1:17:32] it places us into a different
[1:17:37] position praise the Lord it makes us
[1:17:40] obedience the word of God you become
[1:17:43] obedient
[1:17:45] anyhow it conforms us to the word of
[1:17:49] God praise the Lord anyhow find yourself
[1:17:54] obedient
[1:17:55] and conforming to the word of
[1:17:58] God praise the Lord when you look at
[1:18:00] yourself you see something special about
[1:18:04] something different that the world knows
[1:18:07] not praise the Lord why because you have
[1:18:11] received the spirit
[1:18:13] of and you have received the purose of
[1:18:15] God for your age positioning us so when
[1:18:20] you receive this message it is not
[1:18:23] giving us knowledge
[1:18:25] of things that are to be he not giving
[1:18:28] us knowledge about the rupture he not
[1:18:31] giving us things that there is coming a
[1:18:34] rupture is not only giving us knowledge
[1:18:38] of the church ages of the revelation of
[1:18:42] the Seven Seals but this
[1:18:45] message is a m call that is preparing us
[1:18:50] for the things that have been praise the
[1:18:53] Lord it gives us the knowledge
[1:18:55] of the things that are to be so we know
[1:18:58] that there is coming a
[1:19:00] rupture we know that before the end of
[1:19:02] times God has given us things God has
[1:19:06] given the prophets things that are to be
[1:19:09] so it does not profit you to know the
[1:19:13] things are to be praise the Lord and
[1:19:16] then you face judgment praise the Lord
[1:19:19] so this message it
[1:19:22] purpose is to give you the knowledge
[1:19:25] things that are to be and also prepare
[1:19:28] you for those things that are to be and
[1:19:33] the ultimate goal of
[1:19:35] it is to prepare the
[1:19:37] bright for the
[1:19:39] rupture message of Noah was prepare the
[1:19:43] people for the
[1:19:46] RS were coming and now our message is to
[1:19:51] prepare us for the rapture
[1:19:54] the Lord it is not to know the entire
[1:19:56] seven Church
[1:19:59] agents is not know the entire Seven
[1:20:02] Seals the seven trumpets and all the
[1:20:06] Mysteries no is to prepare us is to tell
[1:20:10] us that there is Mery tell us that
[1:20:14] judgment is coming and going the Earth
[1:20:18] here his
[1:20:19] mer yourself behind his mer that is the
[1:20:23] purpose of the message
[1:20:25] praise the Living God is to take us
[1:20:28] ahead of
[1:20:29] time to prepare us for the oncoming
[1:20:32] Jud to tell us to
[1:20:35] escape to tell us time is
[1:20:38] First prepare
[1:20:39] yourselves keep yourself in the words
[1:20:42] the message directs us toward Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ praise the Lord and the prophet
[1:20:50] says then the next thing you go on
[1:20:55] you go to church and you hear the h
[1:20:58] s the gospel preach something and the
[1:21:02] Holy Spirit begins to speak to
[1:21:04] you come repent and you say oh I'm young
[1:21:11] I got plenty of time yet I got this I've
[1:21:16] got to do this you are rejecting God is
[1:21:18] provided
[1:21:20] way judging yourself then how can you
[1:21:23] blame God
[1:21:25] you cannot how shall the world blame God
[1:21:30] they cannot because the gospel has been
[1:21:32] preached the message has been preached
[1:21:36] praise the Lord so you have to blame
[1:21:38] yourself there's not a bit of need of
[1:21:40] anyone going to
[1:21:43] hell God has made AED
[1:21:46] of you can't help being a
[1:21:49] sinner you can't help that you was bornn
[1:21:53] a sinner can help staying a
[1:21:57] sinner you accept Jesus as in your place
[1:22:02] he was made sin for
[1:22:04] you of es you don't have to be a
[1:22:09] sinner
[1:22:11] Christian you will be a
[1:22:13] Christian you be holy not your own
[1:22:17] Holiness his Holiness not what you are
[1:22:21] but what God has done for you in Christ
[1:22:25] see so the message of every
[1:22:28] season points the people
[1:22:31] something praise the L and in this
[1:22:34] generation God has sent us that
[1:22:37] message a must call calling the people
[1:22:41] that there is coming a storm that the
[1:22:44] Earth is going to
[1:22:45] burn repent be baptized everyone of us
[1:22:50] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:22:52] remission of our sins and we shall

[1:23:40] revealed all these
[1:23:43] things him and the prophet revealed all
[1:23:47] these
[1:23:48] things unto us remember when the angel
[1:23:53] was showing these things to
[1:23:59] joh praise the Lord if you read
[1:24:01] Revelation 4 5 chter
[1:24:05] 6 before the
[1:24:08] seals when the angel was breaking down
[1:24:12] the
[1:24:13] things the Bible says John was about WR
[1:24:18] praise the Lord when he saw them he was
[1:24:21] about to write them and the angel told
[1:24:23] him to shut up the book close it leave
[1:24:28] it sealed why these things had to be
[1:24:33] revealed by the last

[1:25:02] the first seal praise the Lord remember
[1:25:06] re 6
[1:25:08] verse1 praise the Lord Brother can give
[1:25:10] us that
[1:25:11] scripture praise the Lord when the angel
[1:25:14] was bringing down telling the
[1:25:17] seals giving the SE to
[1:25:21] John Revelation 6 verse1
[1:25:25] when John
[1:25:27] saw saw a white
[1:25:30] horse a white horse
[1:25:33] rerise the Lord and says and I
[1:25:37] saw when the lamb open one of the
[1:25:41] seals heard the noise of the
[1:25:46] Thunder saying come and
[1:25:49] see and in verse
[1:25:51] two and I saw and behold White
[1:25:55] Horse and he that sat on him had a
[1:25:59] bow and the crown was given unto him and
[1:26:03] he went forth conquering and
[1:26:05] Conquer one that sat upon the
[1:26:08] horse he had a
[1:26:10] b praise the Lord and the Bible says he
[1:26:13] had a b and a
[1:26:16] crown but the did not have an
[1:26:19] arrow so now he went out
[1:26:22] conquering threatening
[1:26:25] threatening the Conquering and to
[1:26:28] conquer praise the Lord and the world is
[1:26:32] confused of what that horse rider
[1:26:35] is when they see a white horse
[1:26:38] rider praise the Lord they may think
[1:26:40] that is Jesus
[1:26:42] Christ but that was not Jesus
[1:26:45] Christ that was the
[1:26:47] Antichrist of the
[1:26:49] Antichrist praise the Lord and when God
[1:26:52] came down and the showed the things to
[1:26:55] Willam
[1:26:56] BR show him that that wasn't that wasn't
[1:26:59] Jesus
[1:27:01] Christ that was the
[1:27:03] Antichrist praise the Lord and when he
[1:27:06] saw
[1:27:07] the he was
[1:27:09] crowned and who was he praise the Lord
[1:27:13] and the prophet says that that was the
[1:27:18] Antichrist praise the Lord he went out
[1:27:22] conquering in the first SE
[1:27:25] when he saw
[1:27:26] that one he says one riding the the
[1:27:30] White
[1:27:32] Horse and that was not actually the son
[1:27:35] of
[1:27:35] man it was the
[1:27:38] Antichrist pling in the white RO with a
[1:27:41] crown on pretending to portray
[1:27:46] righteousness in order to gain
[1:27:48] control and conqu as many as he
[1:27:52] could but soon his true colors would
[1:27:55] show
[1:27:56] up praise the Lord and in the second
[1:27:59] seal after he had gained control he
[1:28:03] began causing
[1:28:05] War killing and causing
[1:28:08] M to those that stood with the words he
[1:28:12] isn't the son of man praise the Lord the
[1:28:15] messenger was
[1:28:17] able scroll
[1:28:20] down and when he had opened the third
[1:28:22] seal
[1:28:26] that I beheld and a black
[1:28:30] horse and he that sat on him had a pair
[1:28:34] of
[1:28:36] balances praise the Lord scroll
[1:28:40] down and I heard a voice saying in the
[1:28:43] mid of
[1:28:45] the a measure of it for a
[1:28:49] penny and three measures of B for a
[1:28:53] penny

[1:29:07] trade control over
[1:29:09] economies praise the lord of the
[1:29:12] earth and this
[1:29:15] control proph says it caused spiritual
[1:29:21] starvation but no one would be allowed
[1:29:23] to preach
[1:29:24] except they had maybe a license
[1:29:27] Authority from the that be the
[1:29:30] Antichrist changing form and in that
[1:29:34] time the people
[1:29:36] stared and it was a dark moment when
[1:29:40] there was spiritual
[1:29:42] Darkness praise the Lord and these seals
[1:29:44] keep resolving revolving over

[1:42:22] message of the hour
[1:42:24] he has revealed unto us all these
[1:42:28] things that had been hidden from the
[1:42:31] foundation of the
[1:42:32] world and he has revealed all of them
[1:42:35] unto
[1:42:36] us praise the lord we know who the
[1:42:40] Antichrist
[1:42:42] Revelation verse 11 remember we saw
[1:42:46] praise the Lord that he took over
[1:42:50] threat and control over economies
[1:42:54] and in 13: 11 I beheld another
[1:42:58] Beast now he has taken over another
[1:43:01] form coming up out of the earth and had
[1:43:05] two horns like a
[1:43:06] lamb SP as a
[1:43:08] dragon and exercises all
[1:43:11] power the first Beast before
[1:43:16] him and listen and causes the
[1:43:20] Earth and them which dwell there in
[1:43:24] toship the first Beast whose deadly
[1:43:27] wound was
[1:43:28] healed and he does great
[1:43:31] wonders so that he makes come down from
[1:43:35] heaven on the earth in the sight
[1:43:38] of great
[1:43:40] Miracles causing great
[1:43:43] Miracles praise the Lord great
[1:43:46] teachers because of the spirit of the
[1:43:49] Antichrist he had power to even bring
[1:43:52] fire from
[1:43:53] doubt and deceives them that dwell on
[1:43:56] the
[1:43:58] Earth by means of those
[1:44:01] Miracles which he had power to do in the
[1:44:05] sight of the Beast saying to them that
[1:44:07] on the
[1:44:08] earth that they should make an image to
[1:44:11] the
[1:44:12] Beast which had
[1:44:14] wound
[1:44:16] SW and did live and he had power to give
[1:44:21] life the image of the Beast that the the
[1:44:25] image of the Beast should both
[1:44:28] speak and cause as many as would not
[1:44:31] worship the image of the Beast should be
[1:44:38] Ked he causes
[1:44:40] all both small and
[1:44:43] great rich and poor free and
[1:44:47] bond you see the mark in their right
[1:44:50] hand
[1:44:54] foreheads and that no man buy or
[1:44:58] sell he had a
[1:45:00] mark the name of the
[1:45:03] Beast the name of the
[1:45:05] Beast the of his
[1:45:08] name the
[1:45:10] Antichrist changing form and here he has
[1:45:14] power to make Miracles he has
[1:45:17] power to even heal he has power to cast
[1:45:22] out devil
[1:45:24] praise the Lord but what makes him how
[1:45:28] how are we able to
[1:45:30] discern is by the word of
[1:45:33] God praise the Lord anything that does
[1:45:37] not
[1:45:38] confess the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord
[1:45:41] and savior in the spirit of the
[1:45:44] Antichrist praise the Lord and anything
[1:45:48] that rejects the message of the
[1:45:50] hour that rejects the word of God for
[1:45:53] our
[1:45:54] day is the spirit of the
[1:45:57] Antichrist because the message of the
[1:45:59] hour is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:46:04] praise the Lord is the revelation of the
[1:46:08] godhead is the message of the hour that
[1:46:11] reveals to us that there is but one God
[1:46:16] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:19] praise the Lord anything that does not
[1:46:23] confess that Jesus is Lord is the of
[1:46:27] antichrist whether causes Fire come from
[1:46:30] heaven and follow the Earth whether they
[1:46:33] cause Miracles as long as they don't
[1:46:37] confess that Jesus is God comeing flesh
[1:46:42] is the sweet of the Antichrist and
[1:46:45] judgment is coming to burn them up there
[1:46:49] is a fire that is coming to burn up the
[1:46:52] Earth
[1:46:54] Whoever has rejected this message shall
[1:46:57] be bured and here is
[1:47:00] wisdom let him that have
[1:47:04] understanding count the number of the
[1:47:07] Beast for the number of a
[1:47:10] man he started out in the first
[1:47:15] SE praise the Lord as a white
[1:47:18] Rider then he comes in red he comes in
[1:47:22] Bale
[1:47:23] he comes in BL praise the Lord and now
[1:47:27] he comes at the Beast he comes as the
[1:47:30] dragon and the Bible says all this is
[1:47:35] one person Satan praise the Lord trying
[1:47:40] to change
[1:47:42] forms until he graduates himself in form
[1:47:45] of a
[1:47:47] man to take control over the Earth and
[1:47:51] here is wisdom
[1:47:53] let him that have
[1:47:55] understanding count the number of the
[1:47:58] Beast for it is the number of a
[1:48:01] man his number is 63
[1:48:07] score the world
[1:48:09] teaches that the that that
[1:48:11] this 6003 score and
[1:48:17] six praise the Lord that is going to be
[1:48:20] a Mark that is going to be put in the
[1:48:23] ahead praise the Lord but we thank God
[1:48:26] the message of The Hour That by the
[1:48:29] message of the hour
[1:48:32] will able to know that this is not a
[1:48:36] Mark or this is not a kind of a form of
[1:48:39] something or something but this is a man
[1:48:44] praise the Lord Satan
[1:48:48] comeing anding himself
[1:48:53] himself into a man to take control over
[1:48:57] the
[1:48:58] Earth here is
[1:49:00] wisdom count the number of the Beast and
[1:49:03] his number the number of a man so the
[1:49:07] white Rider the red horse rider the
[1:49:12] black all of them
[1:49:15] graduate into this image into a man and
[1:49:20] this man is the Antichrist
[1:49:23] this man positions himself in the place
[1:49:28] of the son of man and he
[1:49:32] worshiped like the son of man he's
[1:49:35] worshiped like Jesus Christ he called
[1:49:39] holy and people bow down and
[1:49:42] worship the devil Satan
[1:49:46] himself
[1:49:47] condescending and graduating himself
[1:49:50] into this man that he can cause praise
[1:49:54] the Lord persecution to the word of God
[1:49:58] praise the Lord and the Bible says he
[1:50:01] has power to call fire from heaven he
[1:50:04] has power to make Miracles but he Makes
[1:50:08] Miracles as long as he does not hold the
[1:50:12] word of God and as long as he does not
[1:50:16] confess there is but one God is the
[1:50:20] Antichrist praise the Lord even if he's
[1:50:23] a great
[1:50:24] preacher but if he teaches that there
[1:50:27] are three gods in one he is the spirit
[1:50:30] of the Antichrist because the spirit of
[1:50:32] the Lord was only one God from the
[1:50:36] beginning there was one God in the end
[1:50:40] still one God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:43] praise the Lord so even if he's a great
[1:50:45] preacher and he comes and preaches for
[1:50:49] Paul says if there is if there is any
[1:50:52] other
[1:50:53] I guess it
[1:50:54] is 2 ver
[1:50:58] 6 it says even if it is
[1:51:02] I if I come back in the
[1:51:06] resurrection and
[1:51:09] Angel come and
[1:51:11] preach in other gospel that there are
[1:51:14] three Gods it says Let Me Be A C praise
[1:51:19] the Lord why because there are is only
[1:51:23] one God and outside that the spirit of
[1:51:28] the Antichrist and the message of the
[1:51:30] hour is calling us out the Antichrist
[1:51:34] spirits of the doctrines of
[1:51:37] devils come out of her to come into the
[1:51:41] word to come into Christ such that we
[1:51:46] can be
[1:51:47] rescued from the Judgment that is coming
[1:51:50] to hit the word praise the Lord so
[1:51:54] before God
[1:51:55] judges he has sent us this message to
[1:51:59] give us spiritual
[1:52:00] Revelations praise the Lord that there
[1:52:02] is one God if you notice
[1:52:05] that he says in the message will the
[1:52:08] church go before the
[1:52:10] tribulation did you notice that the says
[1:52:14] I can't do nothing till you come
[1:52:19] here what was it it was a message of the

[1:52:50] order and he says I'm so
[1:52:53] glad says oh that great hour to think
[1:52:57] that we've had a part in this Junction

[1:53:02] Junction remember so it shall be in the
[1:53:05] coming of the son
[1:53:07] of before the fire

[1:53:14] can't do nothing I have got the liver in
[1:53:18] my
[1:53:20] hand to pull and make the fire fall from
[1:53:24] Heaven and the end of Destruction is
[1:53:26] holding the the hand of
[1:53:30] Russia atomic
[1:53:32] bombs that is going to judge this
