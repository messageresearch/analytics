[39:38] [Applause]
[39:41] amen it's again a privilege I mean for
[39:44] me to be here
[39:45] amen and uh as I think a little bit
[39:49] disagree with brother Stephen on that no
[39:52] does that means
[39:54] he's not going with me
[39:56] but I asked him as an elder that I can
[39:59] go with him to Tanzania okay
[40:07] so uh so I'm I'm really looking forward
[40:10] for a good time
[40:12] and also I believe that the Lord has
[40:15] something in store for us this morning
[40:19] so wonderful to come come here
[40:23] as as traveling and moving
[40:27] yesterday evening we were passing we
[40:30] came from from uh from a meeting passing
[40:33] here
[40:34] and so it looks like sometimes the
[40:36] corners the areas it looks so familiar
[40:41] you know and so that's it that's nice if
[40:44] you come to a place
[40:46] where it's where it seems you feel home
[40:54] amen and really we are looking back for
[40:56] many many years of wonderful Fellowship
[41:00] together and I believe it's it was God
[41:04] ordained
[41:06] see I believe that God ordains things
[41:11] you cannot you will not meet every one
[41:13] of the Bride on Earth
[41:17] but the ones that you need to meet you
[41:19] will meet
[41:22] amen amen the rest we will meet on the
[41:24] other side
[41:26] but it's wonderful to see how God
[41:28] ordained things together
[41:32] that we can have a benefit from that
[41:35] amen and that we can be a blessing and a
[41:39] benefit to others
[41:42] I'm so grateful for that and I want to
[41:46] say again thank you for brother Stephen
[41:47] for having me
[41:52] yeah just uh you know uh uh allowing me
[41:57] and supporting and the things because we
[42:00] believe we are on our journey
[42:04] I believe we all believe that we are on
[42:07] our journey
[42:09] not only back into the mind of God
[42:12] because we come from the mind of God
[42:16] Amen Amina but we are not going back
[42:18] into the mind of God
[42:21] but we are going back as manifested
[42:26] God once in God's mind
[42:30] is now becoming manifested
[42:33] and we are going back to Eternity
[42:36] not the way we came from eternity
[42:40] we are going back to Eternity in a
[42:42] different way
[42:45] manifested attributes of God
[42:48] hallelujah
[42:51] going back has manifested attributes
[42:55] what a time that will be on the other
[42:58] side
[42:59] what a worship that will be
[43:02] when you see all those manifested
[43:05] attributes
[43:10] because God is many
[43:13] God is so great
[43:15] we cannot understand him
[43:19] too difficult for our brain to be to
[43:22] catch it
[43:23] so God is so great
[43:26] that he can create
[43:29] evil achieving for a good purpose
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:37] well he didn't create evil
[43:40] but he created Satan I have to
[43:42] understand knowing he would turn evil
[43:47] God is so great
[43:49] it's too great for us to understand
[43:53] amen amen and what a worship that will
[43:56] be on the other side
[43:58] all the attributes manifested attributes
[44:06] and then God according to the Bible will
[44:11] be all and in all
[44:13] amen amen finally
[44:58] the most difficult time of all times
[45:04] to reveal his final plan
[45:08] amen I mean God showed really now he can
[45:11] manifest
[45:14] things that he couldn't manifest years
[45:16] ago
[45:32] all things are possible
[45:36] amen well I I believe we believe this
[45:39] morning
[45:40] all things are possible
[45:43] amen amen make no limitation
[45:47] have no limitations
[45:52] if things look impossible
[45:54] there's nothing too hard
[45:59] [Applause]
[46:01] amen God bless you all

[46:06] time together in going to uh

[46:19] big burden on his heart
[46:21] he told me I'd like to see uh a little
[46:24] bit more of unity
[46:27] amongst the churches there
[46:29] so and uh so he he asked this time my
[46:35] brother Stephen was there before
[46:37] this time they will have a meeting where
[46:40] it looks like all the churches are
[46:41] joining together
[46:44] amen and I want to say praise the Lord
[46:47] for that yeah
[46:51] it's not the time anymore
[46:54] to do our own business

[47:16] we are we are not here to vindicate
[47:18] ourselves
[47:20] we are not here indicating some some men
[47:24] but God is indicating his own words

[51:03] to after
[51:05] foreign
[51:28] [Music]
[52:15] [Music]
[52:34] the Jesus Christ is here
[52:38] we can Embrace him
[52:42] amen amen Genesis 2
[52:46] 21.
[52:47] to 24.9
[52:53] and as we start reading
[52:55] straight away you pay attention
[52:59] to to uh principles
[53:03] that is laid out in the scripture
[53:07] this is how I like to read the scripture
[53:11] I want to see the principles
[53:14] that the scripture is giving us
[53:17] amen amen not just only Doctrine
[53:21] but principles and if you want to
[53:25] understand the principles
[53:30] you will see him moving
[53:34] amongst us
[53:36] and I want to go out from here today
[53:39] was that testimony that Jesus Christ yes
[53:44] crystal is alive
[53:47] amen amen Jesus Christ is alive yes like
[53:52] those who was on the way to Emos
[53:55] they came back that day and they could
[53:58] testify he is alive he is not dead we
[54:03] have seen him away
[54:05] amen Amina
[54:08] and the Lord got
[54:10] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[54:13] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[54:16] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[54:20] and the rip which the Lord God has taken
[54:22] from man made he a woman and brought her
[54:25] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[54:29] bone of my bones this is Flesh of My
[54:31] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[54:34] she was taken out of man therefore shall
[54:38] a man leave his father and his mother
[54:39] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[54:42] shall be one flesh and they were both
[54:44] naked the man and his wife and were not
[54:47] ashamed
[55:29] amen amen amen amen now I I think you
[55:34] have you have you have uh recorded
[55:37] already
[55:39] this is the Lord doing
[55:44] and we understand
[55:46] this is not when man was in spirit form
[55:52] [Music]
[55:55] this is when man was in dust form
[56:00] [Music]
[56:04] amen I mean this is when man was in dust
[56:07] form
[56:12] amen that's very important
[56:15] for us to understand
[56:17] because we are here today and kind of a
[56:21] dust form
[56:26] right which it is we know our spirit man
[56:30] is a different kind or it is a different
[56:33] way
[56:36] so we are here this morning in kind of a
[56:39] dust form
[56:43] because when we die this goes back to
[56:47] the dust of the Earth
[56:49] [Music]
[56:50] foreign
[57:07] just a chapter further
[57:10] a very very uh known scripture
[57:13] Genesis 18 1 and 2.
[57:22] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[57:25] plains of memra and he said in the tent
[57:28] Door In the Heat of the day and he
[57:30] lifted up his eyes and looked in low
[57:32] three men stood by him and when he saw
[57:35] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[57:38] door and bowed himself towards the
[57:40] ground and he said my Lord if now I have
[57:44] found favor in thy side pass not away I
[57:47] pray thee from thy
[57:51] servantage
[58:16] and maybe the the if the Lord allows us
[58:20] I think I'm saying what we're gonna we
[58:21] will just turn finally this morning or
[58:24] this evening
[58:25] because Genesis 18 is actually our story
[58:31] this happened in our day

[58:36] but in time
[58:38] what happened here came God himself
[58:43] got himself coming to Abraham

[58:50] the Royal Seed of Abraham

[59:10] Seed of Abraham

[59:20] foreign
[59:31] this was his first question
[59:33] he never talked to Abraham in that way
[59:37] he said where is
[59:41] so this second this visit was because of
[59:45] the Bride quietly
[59:47] so this visit
[59:49] is because of you
[59:51] let's pray together Heavenly Father we

[1:00:50] and I like I said we want to talk about
[1:00:53] the time after Revival has begun
[1:01:00] and I believe this is a special season
[1:01:06] we understand this is the most
[1:01:10] deceptive season yes
[1:01:15] we see them everywhere
[1:01:17] like we were sitting this morning with
[1:01:19] brother Stephen and his wife in the
[1:01:21] hotel
[1:01:23] there were some religious program going
[1:01:27] a big big program off of I think it was
[1:01:30] Pentecost church
[1:01:33] and there's
[1:01:35] honestly the Bible would let us know
[1:01:40] that all would be deceived
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:45] those names were not written
[1:01:50] deceived means
[1:01:53] you are in something
[1:01:55] without knowing it is wrong
[1:02:01] then you are deceived
[1:02:03] amen I mean amen amen and the whole
[1:02:07] world will be deceived
[1:02:10] this is what is written in the scripture
[1:02:13] that he will deceive Allah amen and we
[1:02:18] wonder sometimes how that will be
[1:02:20] and brother random told us
[1:02:23] we actually go back to the Garden of
[1:02:25] Eden
[1:02:26] he said if was deceived
[1:02:31] it was not Adam being deceived
[1:02:34] but if was deceived so she never thought
[1:02:39] it is wrong what she was doing
[1:02:42] that is what being deceived means
[1:02:46] people think what they're doing is
[1:02:48] absolutely right
[1:02:50] you know though they are worshiping and
[1:02:53] trying to serve God
[1:02:56] and being totally deceived
[1:02:59] this is what the in the state that the
[1:03:02] world is in today
[1:03:06] this is the state that the church is in
[1:03:09] today
[1:03:10] amen amen the church is total deceived
[1:03:15] that's why that's why when the prophet
[1:03:18] came
[1:03:18] he actually called a bride out of the
[1:03:22] church
[1:03:23] he said come out of here my people
[1:03:26] Revelation 18.
[1:03:28] Revelation 18. is taking place
[1:03:33] amen I mean the bride is called out of
[1:03:37] the church system
[1:03:40] amen Amina the brides will not be
[1:03:44] deceived
[1:03:45] as if was deceased
[1:03:48] because she is called out
[1:03:51] where to come to to Christ himself
[1:03:55] to unite with him
[1:03:57] amen that is taking place also
[1:04:01] next to the greatest

[1:04:27] marriage supper
[1:04:31] that we have in the sky
[1:04:33] Amen in the sky in another dimension

[1:04:40] and we have seen the bridegroom coming
[1:04:43] down
[1:04:44] the son of man is the bridegroom um
[1:04:48] Matthew 25 tells us that
[1:04:52] example about the bridegroom
[1:04:55] the marriage finally it says Matthew 25
[1:05:00] 13.
[1:05:03] therefore watch because you don't know
[1:05:06] the hour that the son of man will come
[1:05:10] so the son of man is the bridegroom the
[1:05:15] revealing of the son of man in this hour
[1:05:18] did the son of man came back to Earth

[1:19:22] Christo the second Adam
[1:19:24] redeemed it back yeah
[1:19:29] died for us
[1:19:30] amen but watch
[1:19:33] behind it it's not just Adams behind it
[1:19:38] is
[1:19:44] stop I think that's so important today
[1:19:47] that we understand that and it's about
[1:19:49] to get it amen amen who's really behind
[1:19:51] it
[1:19:52] it was not okay
[1:19:55] the friendly loving Jesus
[1:19:59] begging for mercy
[1:20:02] begging for mercy
[1:20:05] to the great and Angry God
[1:20:14] amen amen amen amen because in this case
[1:20:19] you advocate
[1:20:22] your Advocate your
[1:20:28] okay

[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:53] God the judge of all the Earth
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:09] the bride start understanding
[1:21:13] of knowing who he is
[1:21:16] and when they have the Revelation
[1:21:19] who he is then they understand
[1:21:23] who they are
[1:21:27] very simple
[1:21:30] one day the woman would have understood
[1:21:34] who she is
[1:21:43] one day the woman would have understood
[1:21:47] who she is
[1:21:49] that she was not just a part of Adam
[1:21:53] but she had to understand that she is a
[1:21:57] part of God
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:07] so we understand behind all is the
[1:22:10] father
[1:22:12] it is God himself
[1:22:15] putting Adam to sleep it is God himself
[1:22:19] bringing up that subject
[1:22:22] it's not good that man is alone
[1:22:24] hallelujah it's what God
[1:22:28] calling for a father expression
[1:22:32] it was not Adam
[1:22:34] asking God
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:46] it is
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:58] shall I send Malachi foreign
[1:23:27] hit that
[1:23:29] he never asked you
[1:23:31] do you want to do you need do you want
[1:23:33] Elijah
[1:23:39] so he never asked Adam
[1:23:42] do you want to have a wife
[1:23:47] you never asked Adam Adam do you want to
[1:23:50] have a Revival

[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:53] amen but let's stand there for a few
[1:24:55] minutes
[1:24:56] I found it very so important and we
[1:25:00] understand this principle
[1:25:02] it is behind all it's not just Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ
[1:25:07] the lovely Jesus the Jesus of Nazareth
[1:25:11] amen amen
[1:25:14] behind Allah almighty God
[1:25:18] the judge of Heaven
[1:25:21] and the apricots

[1:25:38] it's Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:22] because if the holy spirit is moving
[1:26:26] he is a Holy Spirit
[1:26:34] like brother Brandon would say welcome
[1:26:36] back no doubt a spirit can move
[1:26:39] but if it is really the Holy Spirit
[1:26:43] if it is the holy spirit is he just
[1:26:46] moving upon flesh
[1:26:50] or is he moving upon Souls
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:57] Ohio

[1:27:02] and really get that principle to your
[1:27:05] heart

[1:27:12] it is
[1:27:16] I want to repeat that he never ask you
[1:27:21] do you want to have Elijah the prophet
[1:27:25] do you want your hearts to be turned
[1:27:27] back
[1:27:29] he said behold
[1:27:34] God himself
[1:27:44] from
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:56] you're not just coming from Jesus Christ
[1:28:04] can you say Amen

[1:30:22] because he want to send the revenge
[1:30:29] it will never be
[1:30:31] the begging of the church
[1:30:40] it must be God himself
[1:30:47] and if we just become instruments in his
[1:30:50] hands
[1:30:54] then God can send the Revival cartoon
[1:30:59] as he wants
[1:31:05] if I pray for a Revival and God sends a

[1:40:48] beginning
[1:40:49] he was not so alone
[1:40:53] as we feel alone is
[1:40:58] when we feel alone we feel nobody is
[1:41:02] with us
[1:41:05] amen amen but God being alone
[1:41:09] it's actually meaning
[1:41:11] you know alone
[1:41:14] means all-in-one
[1:41:20] mates
[1:41:42] [Applause]
[1:41:45] not the doormate
[1:41:49] that's why he's the wife it's not a
[1:41:52] doormate
[1:41:53] you understand what the door mate is
[1:41:56] where you come into the house and you
[1:41:59] put the dirt off
[1:42:02] so God made the woman to be a help mate
[1:42:12] oh get with me
[1:42:13] in the beginning
[1:42:16] what did the first woman had to do
[1:42:22] what should the first before the fall
[1:42:24] now
[1:42:26] God said I will make him and help me
[1:42:30] what should the woman help Adam with
[1:42:33] Adam
[1:42:37] oh well
[1:42:38] she should maybe wash his clothes
[1:42:44] foreign
[1:43:01] so God gives you a wife today
[1:43:03] if God gives you a wife
[1:43:06] it's not just that she wash your clothes
[1:43:09] angry that comes with it
[1:43:15] amen amen
[1:43:20] so God had something different in his
[1:43:22] mind
[1:43:24] yet we understand the fall came if you
[1:43:27] take it on your back way down there you
[1:43:28] can see the position of the woman today
[1:43:30] we understand that
[1:43:33] but we are going back Church
[1:43:37] to before the fall
[1:43:41] is that correct
[1:43:42] when we walk with him hey that's Max 20
[1:43:45] and we are not ashamed
[1:43:49] why we are not ashamed because we are
[1:43:52] dressed because we are close
[1:43:56] into his righteousness because he died
[1:43:59] for us
[1:44:06] that's why the church
[1:44:08] is not afraid it's not a shame
[1:44:18] amen oh you see the plan
[1:44:21] but we are going back Church Calvary
[1:44:27] Calvary the

[1:51:55] amen amen
[1:51:57] let's turn to uh
[1:51:59] Matthew 22 quickly
[1:52:05] let's take a parable
[1:52:08] Matthew 22.

[1:52:34] unto them by Parables
[1:52:36] and then to his disciples
[1:52:39] he explained those parables
[1:52:45] so don't don't be confused
[1:52:47] if God is speaking today through
[1:52:50] Parables
[1:52:52] but the holy spirit is unveiling those
[1:52:55] perils
[1:52:58] is that right don't never expect
[1:53:01] the Holy Spirit to speak plain in public
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:12] amen amen
[1:53:14] now watch the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:53:17] like unto a certain King foreign
[1:53:29] uh-huh uh-huh so it was never

[1:54:31] would not come on
[1:54:44] to the wedding
[1:54:49] huh
[1:54:51] and they would not come I buy them a
[1:54:53] queen they rejected
[1:54:57] to be a part of the wedding

[1:55:08] people are rejecting
[1:55:10] to be a part of the great wedding
[1:55:19] amen amen let's let's read a little
[1:55:23] further
[1:55:24] again he
[1:55:28] that is the Father
[1:55:30] the king send forth other servants
[1:55:33] saying tell them which bidden behold I

[1:56:12] this is you know this Chino has nothing
[1:56:16] to do with Jesus Christ
[1:56:22] you know that Jesus Christ who never
[1:56:25] gave you your inheritance
[1:56:32] Jesus Christ that's supposed to died
[1:56:36] and paid for your inheritance
[1:56:50] through Christ
[1:56:54] we are not Heirs of Christ

[1:57:49] church
[1:57:50] you know why they're outside you know
[1:57:53] why he's outside because the church is
[1:57:55] saying I am rich I have need of nothing

[1:58:10] through this one is going through that

[2:02:40] but when the sun heard thereof
[2:02:47] yeah you're staggering is right
[2:02:49] the Bible said but when the king heard
[2:02:51] it
[2:02:54] not when the bridegroom heard it
[2:02:57] but when the father heard it
[2:03:00] he became so angry what
[2:03:03] [Applause]
[2:03:05] you
[2:03:16] don't want to be the bride tomorrow
[2:03:35] verse 8.
[2:03:40] or then said he to his servants

[2:05:45] foreign
[2:06:23] so there will be bad people in heaven

[2:06:38] the bride

[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:54] is that right
[2:07:56] the bridegroom Jesus Christ
[2:08:01] the second Adam
[2:08:03] it's not inviting he's not inviting the
[2:08:07] second Adam stand at the door he is the
[2:08:11] door and he sees bad people coming

[2:08:20] my righteousness
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:31] hallelujah hallelujah oh my God
[2:08:36] the question is do you want oh yeah
[2:08:42] you see today how churches
[2:08:44] will miss the Rapture they does how
[2:08:48] people miss the Rapture apparently
[2:08:50] that's what we have to go through the
[2:08:52] tribulation
[2:08:54] because they reject
[2:08:57] the full atonement
[2:09:00] brother random says that's why the
[2:09:04] foolish version has to go to the
[2:09:06] tribulation because they reject the
[2:09:11] atonement in its entire formula
[2:09:17] no I'm sorry we are too busy
[2:09:20] wait I'm going to my farm
[2:09:23] I'm going to my farm
[2:09:25] you know I'm I'm sorry I'm too busy I
[2:09:30] have too many things in my church
[2:09:31] we are helping the poor we're feeding
[2:09:35] the poor nothing wrong with that
[2:09:39] but don't let that hinder you coming to
[2:09:43] the marriage if he's inviting you
[2:09:46] there's no excuse me accept the
[2:09:49] invitation
[2:09:51] of the father
[2:09:55] I was asking myself the question
[2:09:59] what is behind that
[2:10:02] what is behind it is
[2:10:05] why it is the father
[2:10:07] Papa why not the son
[2:10:20] your race
[2:10:23] that this you know has nothing to do
[2:10:26] with you
[2:10:31] isn't that wonderful
[2:10:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:10:38] amen give you another one
[2:10:41] very famous for us
[2:10:43] you have heard about elieza right
[2:10:47] who knows a story about aliasa
[2:10:53] you all know the story about elieza
[2:10:56] by the way brother random what's the
[2:11:00] type of him
[2:11:02] looking for a bride it is
[2:11:07] but again amazing
[2:11:10] who sent elieza
[2:11:16] it was not Jesus saying
[2:11:20] I sent unto you
[2:11:23] Elijah the prophets
[2:11:31] it is
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:42] it was not Isaac
[2:11:46] it was not Isaac it was in Isaac one day
[2:11:50] saying
[2:11:52] I need a wife
[2:11:58] it was not saying
[2:12:00] one day
[2:12:02] I need to express myself
[2:12:05] I need to express myself
[2:12:09] because
[2:12:11] never came the only man to reveal the
[2:12:14] son
[2:12:17] the Sun never came
[2:12:20] to reveal the Sun but the sun came later
[2:12:25] to reveal the father
[2:12:29] that's why Jesus said yes
[2:12:33] if you have seen me
[2:12:37] one of his disciples
[2:12:41] show us the father
[2:12:44] what did Jesus say yes
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:52] and you don't know me
[2:12:54] [Music]
[2:13:01] let us give the hand the Lord the hand
[2:13:03] of praise
[2:13:10] even if you don't understand
[2:13:14] I love you
[2:13:19] Mary
[2:13:22] did not fully understand
[2:13:26] but her attitude
[2:13:29] but her attitude
[2:13:32] attitude
[2:13:35] what the angel says made the difference
[2:13:40] she said yes it be to me
[2:13:43] it'd be to me
[2:13:46] Mary said be to me it be to me okay
[2:13:50] Maria Maria is
[2:14:00] have just the right kind of attitude
[2:14:03] to what the angel is telling you know
[2:14:07] I'm not the angel
[2:14:10] I'm not the angel
[2:14:13] the pillar of fire is here Jesus Christ
[2:14:16] is here yes
[2:14:18] the father is here
[2:14:21] the spirit of God
[2:14:25] and was not the spirit of God
[2:14:28] the Father
[2:14:37] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:39] didn't know Jesus said yes
[2:14:42] there's not the Bible says that the
[2:14:45] spirit of God is the father of Jesus
[2:14:48] Christ
[2:14:53] okay you're still with me in the story
[2:14:56] one day
[2:14:59] elieza is commanded
[2:15:06] not from Isaac
[2:15:08] who commanded
[2:15:12] Abraham Ibrahim
[2:15:15] one day Abraham said
[2:15:19] hallelujah hallelujah one day Abraham
[2:15:22] said
[2:15:23] Abraham Ibrahim Isaac Jacob jacobo
[2:15:28] Joseph
[2:15:29] one day
[2:15:31] Abraham said he blamed he had an Isaac
[2:15:34] now
[2:15:35] amen amen is that right Abraham had an
[2:15:39] Isaac already Ibrahim so Abraham was not
[2:15:44] asking for a second Isaac
[2:15:55] amen amen because there was already one
[2:15:59] Isaac
[2:16:05] remember
[2:16:07] Isaac is not Christ is
[2:16:10] typing Christ
[2:16:16] in Christ
[2:16:17] dwells the fullness of the godhead
[2:16:22] bodily
[2:16:27] as we go along amen and so we try to
[2:16:30] keep it really sharp down together
[2:16:32] amen amen but again we see it as the
[2:16:36] father
[2:16:41] and the father makes sure
[2:16:45] you don't go anywhere else
[2:16:52] to find a bride

[2:18:22] the angel of God yes go before you
[2:18:27] um
[2:18:29] is that right did Abraham say that take
[2:18:31] it no pressure
[2:18:33] to make sure yes you find the right wife
[2:18:41] [Music]
[2:18:43] is Papa
[2:18:46] so concerned
[2:18:49] about the right wife

[2:20:20] nothing can defeat you
[2:20:24] if you know who you are
[2:20:29] Hallelujah
[2:20:37] remember how brother brought this simple
[2:20:39] example
[2:20:41] of the son of the king who was a
[2:20:45] prisoner in a foreign land
[2:20:48] he was eating slave food
[2:20:51] he was treated like a slave
[2:20:53] he was misused like a slave he was sold
[2:20:58] like a slave
[2:20:59] but because he knew who he was
[2:21:03] nothing could get him down
[2:21:07] nothing could depress him
[2:21:12] if depression comes your way
[2:21:14] tell the depression Who You Are

[2:21:27] my body you can impress my mind you can
[2:21:31] depress my human Spirit but you can
[2:21:34] never depress me

[2:21:40] God and I go back
[2:21:42] [Applause]
[2:21:49] amen maybe we stay with us
[2:21:51] amen and then this evening we continue
[2:21:55] but you understand
[2:21:57] why was Abraham right he blamed more
[2:22:01] concerns
[2:22:02] about a bride
[2:22:05] then Isaac was
[2:22:10] Isaac in the picture
[2:22:15] Isaac is completely out of the picture
[2:22:23] we are chosen in Christ
[2:22:29] Honda
[2:22:33] [Applause]
[2:22:37] just we get the picture really clear
[2:22:41] what is the Mind behind
[2:22:44] you know what Abraham knew
[2:22:48] Isaac it's me in another form
[2:22:54] um
[2:22:57] and when he will have another son
[2:23:01] or another daughter
[2:23:05] Hindi
[2:23:14] because
[2:23:16] Isaac is my son is
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:28] Jesus Christ yes crystal is God
[2:23:35] in another form
[2:23:42] and God is concerned
[2:23:44] wonderful to find a wife but Jesus
[2:23:48] Christ because God knows what comes out
[2:23:52] of that wife
[2:23:53] will be God in another form
[2:24:03] Ula
[2:24:06] can I close with this
[2:24:08] use the prophet we don't I don't have
[2:24:11] fuse many I just wanted to use so many
[2:24:14] statements of the prophet
[2:24:18] allow me the prophet
[2:24:21] because we are going back
[2:24:24] what had God in his mind
[2:24:28] when he made Adam the wife no
[2:24:34] he did not took another dust
[2:24:38] it took from that dust yeah
[2:24:45] it took from that dust yeah
[2:24:49] foreign
[2:24:55] the feminist part out
[2:24:59] called a rib easy
[2:25:05] can you say amen
[2:25:07] he took out from Adam Adam
[2:25:11] his
[2:25:13] female parts
[2:25:18] do you know that God is male and female
[2:25:25] you can go back to Genesis
[2:25:27] and God made man in his own image
[2:25:32] male and female created to him
[2:25:38] so if man is in his own image
[2:25:40] and God
[2:25:42] must be male and female
[2:25:44] cartoons
[2:25:54] foreign
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:26:18] Hallelujah
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:26] allow me to say now
[2:26:28] let me quote the prophet
[2:26:32] um
[2:26:33] I Trust You Are really with me
[2:26:36] because we are going back to that
[2:26:39] we're going back to that back to before
[2:26:42] the fall
[2:26:48] dust form
[2:26:51] and before the fall
[2:26:54] the spirit man
[2:26:56] was in that dust man
[2:26:59] [Music]
[2:27:00] um
[2:27:03] just to make a little bit more plain
[2:27:04] foreign
[2:27:10] amen amen
[2:27:14] listen what brother was saying in the
[2:27:17] message does God change his mind about
[2:27:19] his words
[2:27:23] amen amen
[2:27:26] he said just like in the beginning
[2:27:29] is what it was not God's perfect will
[2:27:33] because for children to be born to the
[2:27:36] Earth through sex
[2:27:39] no sir
[2:27:44] God created Man
[2:27:47] Out of the Dust of the earth
[2:27:51] breathe is the breath of life into him
[2:27:55] and he became a living Soul
[2:27:59] he took from that man a held mate
[2:28:03] and made a wife unto him
[2:28:07] that was God
[2:28:10] that was God's first and original will
[2:28:15] okay
[2:28:21] wow wow that
[2:28:25] is God changing his mind about his words
[2:28:27] never
[2:28:33] sex was permitted
[2:28:37] because of the Fall
[2:28:40] the fall is
[2:28:47] Adam where I'm thou Adam when God called
[2:28:51] Adam where Adele Adam
[2:28:57] was there Adam God saw Adam
[2:29:02] is that right
[2:29:04] but still he said Adam
[2:29:08] and Adam said here
[2:29:10] this is not God's asking
[2:29:25] into another dimension
[2:29:32] hallelujah
[2:29:33] amen amen
[2:29:36] they want to read it again he took man
[2:29:39] from that man to help mate who made your
[2:29:42] life to him that was God's first
[2:29:46] and original will okay
[2:29:56] can we say Amen
[2:29:59] listen let's go a little bit further
[2:30:02] but when sin come in and did the thing
[2:30:06] it did then he permitted man to marry a
[2:30:09] wife
[2:30:11] and have children
[2:30:14] multiply and replenish the Earth
[2:30:18] that's the way you are going to do it
[2:30:22] but you see it never was his perfect
[2:30:27] [Music]
[2:30:29] okay go ahead guys
[2:30:32] therefore all these things that have
[2:30:35] been has to happen
[2:30:40] all the things that had the beginning
[2:30:44] all sin has to come to Annihilation
[2:30:49] all sin has to be done away
[2:30:53] therefore in the great Millennials the
[2:30:57] Resurrection comes we will not have to
[2:31:00] be reborn again
[2:31:03] but God like he did in the beginning
[2:31:10] and his help made with him
[2:31:13] that's right that's the way he did it
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:20] isn't that wonderful that's how brother
[2:31:23] random could say allow me the quote said
[2:31:26] when God had Man made out of the Dust of
[2:31:29] the earth and his wife
[2:31:30] [Music]
[2:31:37] they they would have gone plump back to
[2:31:40] the millennium
[2:31:48] hmm
[2:31:50] amen amen you understand time was
[2:31:54] introduced
[2:31:55] because God because of time because of
[2:32:00] sin already there's a few attributes God
[2:32:04] can only express
[2:32:06] because he allowed him
[2:32:13] amen amen if they would not be sin God
[2:32:18] could never show
[2:32:19] he's a Healer
[2:32:22] HIV
[2:32:38] to have the chance to express himself
[2:32:45] but when that served its purpose
[2:32:50] when that served its purpose
[2:32:55] what's allowed for God to express things
[2:33:01] that he could not do without but yeah
[2:33:05] when that expression comes to an end
[2:33:09] then we go back to Eternity
[2:33:14] is continually expressing himself
[2:33:22] hallelujah hallelujah I can say what a
[2:33:24] mighty God we serve
[2:33:26] what a great God we say yes
[2:33:43] where's your victory
[2:33:47] Hallelujah
[2:33:53] hallelujah hallelujah

[2:34:16] we will call it
[2:34:20] listen when God give a commission which
[2:34:26] cannot perish
[2:34:28] God's word is eternal
[2:34:31] it cannot fail
[2:34:33] when he said
[2:34:35] multiply and replenish the Earth
[2:34:39] that was God's Eternal purpose
[2:34:43] to carry that out
[2:34:47] you cannot die
[2:34:49] because it is his word you have to live
[2:34:56] foreign

[2:35:36] of the evil one
[2:35:37] the first time that Adam brought forth
[2:35:41] Adam
[2:35:44] [Music]

[2:36:27] we know how Eve was deceived
[2:36:30] we don't have time to go into this now
[2:36:33] but like I said we want to dig down deep

[2:38:25] they want to manufacture the book of
[2:38:27] Acts
[2:38:39] if we had time we could go back to the
[2:38:42] first church
[2:38:43] to show the Antichrist Spirits
[2:38:46] doing exactly the same thing
[2:38:49] in the first church
