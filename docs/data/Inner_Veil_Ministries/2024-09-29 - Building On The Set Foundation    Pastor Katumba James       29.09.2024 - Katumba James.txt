appreciate that their dedication Amen Let Us stand up for a scripture reading we are going to the book of Ephesians chapter 19 up to verse 22 Ephesians 2 verse 19 up to verse 22 the Bible says now there you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building F FR together growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord also are build together for ANH habitation of God through the spirit us pray father we thank you again and we give praise for the scriptures that we have read we pray that the Holy Spirit may come Lord Jesus Christ and give more light on these scriptures that we may have an understanding and build our faith Lord and be established in your Lord we pray you may bless us all together and help us to grow in you Lord that we may strive the St of a perfect in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ pray and ask this amen you may be seated so I want to preach on the subject building on the set Foundation Building on the set Foundation praise the name of the Lord now the Bible is telling us in verse 20 that we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so we see that the apostles the New Testament and then the prophets the Old Testament and then the Bible is telling us that we are built on this foundation and now this Foundation is the word of God praise the name of our Lord so there is no other Foundation that we can be built on and then be certain that we are safe praise the name of our Lord now when we go to the scriptures here we go to the book of First Corinthians chapter 3 First Corinthians chapter 3 and then we read from verse 10 he says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build on but let every man take he how he build there upon so here Paul is saying that I'm the wise master builder so we see that in the the New Testament most of the letters in the New Testament we are written by Paul and it's not that Paul did it by himself but it was the spirit of God that was upon Paul that inspired him to write these letters praise the name of our Lord you see that most of the Epistles here which are actually in the New Testament where written by Paul when for example you read from the Romans First Corinthians second Corinthians Gans Ephesians Philippians phans Thessalonians second Thessalonians First Timothy second Timothy Titus filimon and Hebrews were all written by praise the name of our Lord he wrote more than 50% praise the name of our Lord of all the letters in the New Testament when you read the book of Matthew Matthew wrote about the life of Jesus Christ Mark wrote about the life of Jesus Christ L wrote about the life of Jesus Christ the same thing with John then Luke also writes the book of Acts based on what he had and what he saw praise the name of our Lord and then you see that Luke was following the ministry of Paul and then you will see you'll take interest that from about acts 13 it talks more about the ministry of Paul End praise the name of our Lord so you see Paul says I'm the wise master builder he wrote the New Testament by the revelation of God God gave him the grace to write praise the name of our Lord then he says I'm the wise master builder he was setting the found praise the name of Lord was setting the foundation on which the building of God is built on which the Church of God is built praise the name of the Lord preached about everything that concerns our Christian faith praise the name of our Lord he preached about everything and so Paul praise the name of our Lord gives the standard he gives the standard praise the name of our Lord and you know even when brother Bram was getting you know finding out the The Messengers to the church agent he was using Paul now in the Ephesian Church AG page 68 he says when I said that God and his ways never change I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't God so she can change but what has said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that's how it is done the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today we try to approximate the early first church and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that comes that comes the closest to Paul who was free from all men sold out to God and gave the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do that you have to work from the original as like be like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age is that simple and wonderful praise the name of the Lord so now God has given us a standard and the standard is in his word you know what we need to follow praise the name of our Lord and then we have been called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ but even at the beginning there was a bride in the book of Acts each and every one of us we need to be Desiring to be like that bride at the beginning to be like that church at the beginning to be like those Believers at the beginning should always be our desire every because it is the same spirit of God and if it is the same word The Same Spirit then it has also to make us to be the same praise the name of our Lord and that should always be our desire you know you read in the Bible and then you get examples that can really challenge you and so then you work out to those examples praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says we have a great cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11 you know whatever we are going through there are people who went through what but then we need to ask ourselves when they were going through what I'm going through how would they handle the how would they handle the challenges that I was facing praise the name of our Lord so we have an example that has already been given to us praise the name of the Lord so now Paul says I am the master builder so he said I have laid the foundation praise the name of our and then now when he continues continues to say let every man take how he build on that found for no other Foundation 1 Corinthians 3: 11 for no for other Foundation can no man L than that is laid which is Jesus Christ praise the name of Lord no other man you can't lay another foundation and then it is acceptable of God and then it says that Foundation which he has laid is the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so now us also we are built on that same Foundation we become part of this building and now each and every every one of us praise the name of our Lord the Bible says in First Peter chapter 2 and then verse verse five praise the name of our Lord the Bible says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jes Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so the Bible is telling us we are Lively stones and if we are Lively Stones then there is gross praise the name of our Lord you're not going to be the same but there has to be a change working out in your life for you to conform for you to be transformed to the image of Jesus Christ we are a Lively Stone in other words there is the spirit of God in us and the spirit of God keeps on Guiding us keeps on instructing Us Praise the name of the Lord you know just like this building the foundation was set but then to bring the building the way it is bricks had to be put one on top of another and you know it's not just merely putting one on top of the other there had to be skilled people to do that together and they were not just merely putting bricks together but a particular direction had to be done praise the name of our Lord now when they were building the Temple of Solomon they were getting stones from different areas praise the name of our Lord and now in the message conference with God when Solomon's Temple was cut out across the world the stones were cut out across the world it was cut all over the world different fun looking Stones than everything else but when they begin to come together there wasn't a buz or a sound of a hmer 40 years in erecting of the temple they never had one hmer beit or a they were all cut out just right these great churches that has got the Holy Ghost will move right together in there fed places that day in the body of Christ for the rupture praise the name of our Lord you know this is a very good example that when they were building the Temple of Solomon builders went out in different countries different rocks and then they were cutting rocks from those places and The Rock would be so big and then they would transport them to Jerusalem and now when they brought these rocks from different places they never shaped any Rock when it reached at the temple site but they had to make sure that they get these stones that they join each other properly praise the name of our that's how was being built because God said that there should be no hmer at the temple so they got stones from different areas and then they brought them to the temple and then the builders had to be inspired started joining Stone to Stone and even that's how God also saves Us Praise the name of our Lord we come from different backgrounds we come from different tries we come from different family backgrounds we come from different you know education and so on praise the name of the Lord some people are raised in a particular way until now what this one calls good other calls it bad but that scure education background how this one dresses like this says I can't do like that praise the name of our different backgrounds like now praise the name of you know you can put on your cloth you like and maybe your put on a green Shir and then you put on a red one red down here and then you put on White Shoes somebody says color but that's his teste and then you put on a black tie here or you put on a strapped coat here or with flowers somebody says I don't like that but that's cut is cut from that side praise the name then another must put on the same colors throughout the shoes the heart Bel the sh or the browse or the bag totally different so we are got from different backgrounds we have got from different family background we are got from different exposures but then God brings us together to make the building of God praise the name of our Lord and even that's what it is as a church we come from different areas we have been raised differently we have different kind of opportunities we have different kind of work we have different kind of financial status or abilities one may be Desiring and praising his small heart and very Happ about it now when the other comes to the heart what is this but the other is so grateful about it but at the end of the day we are all children of God praise the name of that's why the Bible says when he invited the guest there was somebody at the entrance to put a robe on every one of them praise the name of our so when we come here we make sure we get the same Rob of the Holy Spirit praise the name of our Lord so then there will be no difference whether I'm educated or I'm not educated whether I'm a student whether I'm a university Professor whether I'm unemploy employe we are all children of God the name of you've been cut from different places but now when we come to the temple praise the name we need to find our positions in the building and that's what we need to know because it's a building that is being have you found your position in the building have you got your position on the whole building you identify yourself as part of the body of Jesus Christ that should give us joy praise the name of the Lord that I'm part of the building it doesn't matter my backround have I received of The Same Spirit have I believed the same word praise the name of our Lord that should be something that gives us joy praise the name of our Lord because all the other things are temporary things praise the name all the others are temporary but then we need to make sure that we are part of the building of God we need to make sure that we are the habitation of the holy spirit that the holy spirit is pleased to dwell within me the holy spirit is pleased to abide within you praise the name of our Lord so Paul as the master builder he set up the foundation and then he didn't set up this Foundation based on his education in galanter 1 and then verse 11 he says but I stify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I nether received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord so Paul says the gospel that I preach the gospel that I believe it was by the re of Jesus Christ I never went to school to get it but it was the Christ himself who revealed himself to me and that is also the same thing with us that each and every one of us must get a personal revelation of who Jesus Christ is each and every one of us otherwise you can't be part of the building if you don't know who Christ is because at the end of the day we are making the body of Jesus Christ we are making the habitation of God so we need to get a personal revelation Christ himself revealing to you praise the name of the Lord and then you can know I know where I stand I know my position in the body of Jesus Christ I know why the Lord has called me praise the name of our Lord let us go to marthew chapter 16 and then verse 13 praise the name of the Lord the Bible says when Jesus came into the courts of CIA Philip he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am praise the name of the Lord you know it is easy to talk what about about what others talk about something oh how they call that it is EAS for you to talk because you've heard but your what do you talk about it praise the name of the Lord why do you go to that church that church is near my praise the name of that church I can sit that church when it is they put on the F and that brings you to the church church if I'm tired of sitting on the chair sit down because they have tites you know different reasons why do you go to that church there's enough paring if I'm tired I can go and sit on the veras why do you go to that church you know you can have those kind of things but then the thing is who do you call Christ praise the name of our Lord who do you call Christ what is Christ to you so now they told Jesus that some call you Jeremiah some call you Elijah some call you John the Baptist one of those prophets and then Jesus asked them what about you how do you call me and you see that's where the starting point praise the name of who do you call me like you know we have children who have been raised up in believing families why do you go to that church because my mother goes there my father goes there my friend goes there that's not reason enough you must know the real thing why you are part of the church praise the name of the Lord why so it has to come a personal revelation praise the name of our Lord I go to that church because they preach the message of the I go to that church praise the name of our because they preach about the Lord Jesus Christ I go to that church because the emphasize the life of Jesus Christ in our Liv you must have a reason praise the name of the Lord so now Jesus asked them but who do you say that I am and then in verse 16 and Simon Peter answered and say the Christ the son of the Living God praise the name of our Lord he had to get a personal re and we also need to get a personal revelation when you get a personal revelation of who Christ is the Bible says the gates of hell can never Prevail against praise the name of our Lord so Jesus say Jesus answered and said unto him blessed at those Simon by John for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto you that th at Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so the the The Rock he was talking about was the rock of Revelation and it's upon the rock of Revelation that we are built upon praise the name of the Lord so you yourself if you are going to be part of the building of God if you going to be the body of Jesus Christ to get a personal revelation who Christ is to as an individual praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and then brother Bram says they will fight it they will be against it but they will not Prevail against why it is a sure Foundation you are really anchored into Ita the name of our when Jesus started preaching in John chapter 6 and said unless you eat of My Flesh unless you drink of my blood many of his ministers were offended and they went away let us go to joh 6 praise the name of our Lord John chapter 6 let us read from verse 53 can start from verse 15 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I give is my flesh which I'll give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them very very I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no teaching praise the name of our Lord and sometimes even we go through such STS in the Life along the path Trials Come testing comes praise the name of the Lord the teaching can be hard for you and then the Bible says in verse 16 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this say this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew himself that his disciples M that [Music] te he said unto them does this offend you praise the name of the Lord but you know those who never had a personal revelation they went back because some people attract the ministry of Jesus Christ by the food he was making by The Miracles he was making by the healing was doing by the benefits around his ministry and then we see there also some people who come to church because of that but those are temporary things praise the name of the Lord you should look at something beyond that praise the name of the Lord it is the word of God that should be the attraction before us praise the name of our Lord attracted by the word of God and then you say what I desire most is the word of eternal life preached to my soul it doesn't matter what I'm going through it doesn't matter the circumstances I'm going but what I desire is God to speak to my soul praise the name of our Lord then the Bible says in verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and wed no more with him then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life and we believe sure that th the Christ the son of the Living God now you see the basis of Peter stay was the Revelation that he got in MTH 16 that you are the Christ the son of the living so we need also to ask ourselves also got that Revelation because if you don't have that Revelation along the way you'll find yourself going away because you're not seeing any F interest but when you know that it is the word of life you know that it is Christ feeding from Christ I'm receiving the word of eternal life will keep there regardless of what you're going through regardless of the circumstances that you're going through praise the name of our and it's only the word of God that can keep us in his presence not Miracles praise the name of our Lord not big programs you know this project has come let us try to keep the youth doing this this project has come let us try to keep the professionals doing this you know in those denominations they have many of those things they see somebody who has come to their church and they say what what work does he do an accountant you be the treasur what work does he do an engineer you handle the construction Pro what does he do a health worker hand first eight what work does he do is a teacher do Sunday school what work does he do is a counselor let him beheading the counseling of people they try to who people by different small small attachments until they keep them busy the whole day says you have work to do at church are very early this is the progam if those things stop they also stop because they have no attachment but then what should attract us is the word of eternal life praise the name of our you know there is a story in Luke chapter 16 when the rich man died and he went to hell praise the name of our you know some say that in Hell there is no fire but the Bible States when this man reached in hell he was under torment fire was too much you know one should not first go there to prove that there is fire praise the name of you just know there is and I don't want to go there praise the name of our Lord so now this man looked at Lazarus and Lazarus was living by his house and then he said Father Abraham s Lazarus to my house I have five brothers let him go and tell to them let him testify to them let him preach to them that they don't come in this place because he saw where he was was very dangerous and then he remember these five brothers and he didn't want them to come to the same place he was in in heav and then Abraham told him they have Moses and the prophets in other words it was at the time of the law and the prophets the Lord Jesus Christ had not died and resurrected yet so now they were being held down in Paradise Paradise before the res of Jesus Christ was neighboring hell praise the name of our Lord so the people in hell would see the people in paradise and then they would talk but nobody would cross to the Earth because the blood of Jesus Christ had not yet been shed praise the name of our Lord but now when the blood of Jesus was shed all those who were in Paradise resurrected with Jesus Christ on the resurrection morning praise the name of our Lord so now the man was saying let Lazarus go they know he died so if he res they will believe him now you can imagine how big a miracle resurrecting is dead for many years but he resurrected is the very one he has come come and preach theel and will believe Abraham said no if they can't hear Moses there no Miracle they can believe same thing now if we can't take the word of got to be serious it doesn't matter what project is brought praise the name of the Lord it doesn't matter what Miracle happens it doesn't matter what happens as long as the word has been rejected as long as the one that's been despised nothing else will be received praise the name of the Lord so we need to have a personal revelation Christ is and then it will hold your anchor the name of whether the storms come whether the Trials

these qualities kindness humbleness long suffering of Mercy verse forbearing one another and forgiving one another man have a COR against any even as Christ forgave you so do ye praise the name of forgiveness and you see sometimes forgiveness people want to give conditions to forgive but you're tormenting yourself you know the Bible says the other man who was forgiven 50,000 went and got a fellow worker and he was demanding only 500 now the king forgave the other man 50,000 and there were talents but this one was a P 500 and was refusing to forgive the other now you imagine that they
