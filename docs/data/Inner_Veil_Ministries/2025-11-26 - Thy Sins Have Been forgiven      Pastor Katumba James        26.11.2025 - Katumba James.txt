Thank you for your loving kindness Lord. And thank you father for this quickening power Lord for that spirit Lord which gives life because Lord as the letter killth Lord but we have both the letter Lord and the spirit Lord. Father Lord Jesus we've not come by the law. We've not walked by the law Lord Jesus but we walk by the spirit. We walk by the ordinances of the Lord. Oh precious Jesus, help us Lord that we may not neglect this gospel. Oh God, that we may not neglect this mercy Lord. Father God, the Bible says you are rich in mercy and you are full of grace and truth, Lord. What you've said, it will never come void. And whatever comes from out of your mouth, Lord, it will have to purpose what the the intent of it, Lord. Precious Jesus, [music] as you called us the bride, as you called us a people out of the denomination, Lord, and the prophet gave us the emphasis, Lord, that this message is not going to unite. Oh, precious Jesus. But Lord, we see it live. We see it, Father, being backed by the signs of the Lord. Precious Jesus, the presence of the spirit of our Lord. Oh Lord God, I commit father Lord Jesus. [music] Whoever has come into this message, Lord, the entire body of Jesus Christ, may you walk with them, Lord. May you stand by them, Lord.

As [music] this the prophet said that the Lord waters them that no one can pluck them out of the hands of our Lord. Precious Jesus we are so precious Lord because one so unto the Lord is worth 10,000 words. Oh Lord Jesus, oh precious Jesus, the songwriters say what shall we give in exchange for this opportunity? What shall we give in exchange Lord for eternal life? What shall we give in exchange of a word? And what shall we father Lord Jesus give in exchange of the you know communion of the spirit? Precious Jesus we are persuaded that Lord God neither death nor perils nor distresses no persecutions Lord no heavy trials can separate us from the love of God. Precious Jesus we thank you for that confidence Lord we thank you father for the assurance of mercies oh God which has been poured in our hearts. Oh Lord God, we love you Jesus. [music] We appreciate you, oh God. May you lead us as we walk towards your the coming of our Lord and towards the change of the bodies. Oh father, may we bear the testimony, oh God, like any cloud before we he was [music] translated, he had a testimony that he pleased our Lord. Lord Jesus, may that same history repeat itself, Lord, and to the children of our Lord. And Lord God, we walk that we may walk in the old earths of father the apostles. We thank you Jesus because the same seed which was cast down the ground and it is the same one which has come forth lord. Father may it bring forth its fruit and in abundance.

The grace that you've given unto us to come into You said where two or three are gathered in your name, we will be there in their midst. And father, we believe you are here and you also promised that they shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be their peace. We pray you may teach us through your word that you may establish us, Father. that Lord we may not be moved by any form of wind of doctrine or any powers of darkness. Lord, may you grant also to meet all our needs, Father, as we commit ourselves before you upon these meetings, Lord, such as are sick and afflicted, your purpose and will be done in the name of the Lord Jesus. This Amen. Amen. I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us turn to Luke 5. &gt;&gt; We're reading from verse 17 to verse 20. Luke 5. Verse 17 to verse 20. The Bible says, "And it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! And behold, men brought in a a bed, a man with which was taken with pulsy, and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. [clears throat] And when they had they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his coach into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, "Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. May God bless of his word. You may be seated. I want to preach on the subject. Thy sins are forgiven. Praise the name of our Lord. Now when we go in the scriptures, the Bible says that we were born in sin and then we are shaped in iniquity. Our first birth makes us sinners by nature. You know people were born in sin, shaped in iniquity. The natural man is actually you know rebellious by nature. You know that's the nature that we taken in our first birth. We are easily influenced by wrong things and even the the environment that we live in there are domains of Satan because right now Satan is the prince of the world's one who rules the world. You know he has agents he uses to rule the world. He has systems he has already established. So now when we are born into this earth you know we come by sinners by nature. We are born sinners by nature. Now then the systems that surround us everything is just bent on doing what the devil wants to be done like when you look at the systems you know they said don't do this but they themselves do the same thing you know then they like now we can look what the law enforcers You get them breaking the same laws they saying that they telling people to keep because it is a nature. It's just a nature for them. He says this is my work. But then when you follow you find he's doing the same thing. Now, so we were born in sin and then we were shaped in iniquity but you know God rich in mercy. Praise the name of our Lord. He reached down to see that we are delivered from our sin. Praise the name of our Lord in the message. God hiding himself in simplicity. Now when man before he sinned, when man sinned, he separated himself from God and he crossed a great chasm and put himself in death on this side. You know when you read in Genesis chapter one, the Bible says that everything that God created was very good. And now sin comes in Genesis chapter 3. But then in Genesis chapter 2, God tells the man not to eat of the fruit. And then he says, you know, that day you eat of the fruit, you will die. So now man, that's Eve and Adam, &gt;&gt; they left obedience to the word of God and then they were able to take what the serpent was telling them. And that's how sin came in. And now when sin came in, it separated man from God. And that's what always sins does. Sin will always separate you from God. You'll not have a f continuous fellowship. You'll find that when you are you have sinned, you don't want to meet God. You don't have strength to pray to God. You don't want to wait on the Lord. Your heart condemns you. You feel something which is not right. Like there are some people when they get themselves into something which is not right. They stop coming to church. They stop coming to church. You know they no longer come to church. You know they no longer read their Bibles. You see how they can avoid a brother or a sister when you meet them on the road. You see their lives actually they are no longer in the spirit of God. That's what sin does is it separates you from God. Like the same thing when God could come in the cool of the day to have fellowship with Adam and Eve. So when God reached a place of communion, Adam was not there. Eve was not there. Then he said, "Adam, Adam, where are you?" And then Adam &gt;&gt; said we are afraid you know. So but Adam started confessing his situation. We are afraid because we are naked. And then he asked him who told you that you are naked? Did you eat of the tree that I told you not to eat? Then he said the woman, you know, excuses all the time. The woman has told me to do this. Then the woman, the serpent has caused me to do this. Excuses all the time. But you see, if we are coming to God and we desire the forgiveness of our sins, we shouldn't put our blame on somebody else. sin. Own your sin. You know, you say, "Lord, it's me who is wrong." And this is what David said. He said, "I acknowledge my transgressions. You know, I I accept it. Praise the name of our Lord. I confess that I'm the one who has done wrong. I'm not saying it is somebody else who has caused me to do this. But that's the desire of God that each of us can acknowledge our mistakes. You say, "I am the person who has done wrong. I have failed in this kind of matter. I've not walked right before you, Lord. Praise the name of the Lord." So he says, There was no way for him to get back. And then when he did, God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep &gt;&gt; or something for blood on that side is a son of God, is an offspring from God, is an inheritance of the earth. He can control nature. He can speak it into existence. Why? He's a creator himself. He's an offspring of God. Now, that was before the fall. Dominion over all the earth. Praise the name of our Lord. Genesis 1 verse 26. He had dominion, you know, but then when he sinned, he lost that dominion. So man rules the earth by dread, you know, just kind of, you know, scares things. Before they fall, he all the animals to come and he named all the animals. But now when the fall comes, They have to deise means of controlling animals. When they have maybe animals like lions, they have to put them in a cage. If they want to touch a lion, they have to shoot it with a gun, maybe with seductive medicine. You know, they just kind of like shoot some medicine in it to make it drowsy or like sleep and then they can touch it. But in it senses they can't do such a thing. Now that means that the son of God has lost his dominion. But now when God restore us back to our right positions, we shall go back to what it was like in the beginning. Praise the name of our Lord. And it's the new birth that restores us back to what it was in the beginning. Praise the name of our Lord. Like brother Brham when he was crossing a certain farm and then there was a mad cow coming. Then the divine love of God came in his heart and then he was able to temp the mad cow. You know he was getting into a condition of before the fall was. And then the Bible tells us that during the millennial reign of Jesus Christ will be peace all over the earth. Praise the name of Lord. But as we are living under these conditions where there is a lot of pollution, there is a lot of wickedness. There is destruction that always comes forth. Praise the name of Lord. Then in paragraph 407 but when he crossed he separated his sunship. He is a sinner by nature is under the hands and dominion of Satan. And God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood But the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce sin. It only covered sin. Praise the name of Lord. So in the Old Testament, they were using the blood of animals and the blood of animals would just only cover the sin. But now in the New Testament, our Lord Jesus Christ sheds his own blood. And now the blood of Jesus Christ remits sin. Praise the name of our Lord. Removes our sin. Praise the name of our Lord. When Jesus was preaching in Israel and then they heard of the great things that the Lord was doing. So they brought this man through a roof. And now when they dropped him in the midst of Jesus Christ, he told this man, your sins are forgiven. Now you should also know that sickness, death, suffering, many of these things which are not pleasant as a result of sin. Praise the name of Lord. If the sin was not there, there wouldn't be death. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be suffering. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be sickness because all these things come as a result of sin. There wouldn't be famine. There would not be like poverty. But all these things come as a result of sin. Because the earth was cast because of sin that you can even labor and then you are not getting anything out of it. So now when he told this man your sins are forgiven then the secrets and the pes were wondering who is this who forgives sin. Praise the name of our Lord. And so many people cannot believe that their sins are forgiven or they cannot accept the sacrifice that our Lord Jesus Christ did for us. Praise the name of our Lord. But you need to believe the word of God that when you confess your sins in the name of the Lord, they are forgiven. Praise the name of. You need to have that faith and believe that if I can confess my sins before the Lord, the Lord will forgive me of my mistakes. The Lord will forgive me of my trespasses. forgive me of my failures. Praise the name of the Lord. Do not allow Satan, you know, to put it in your mind that you can never be forgiven because that's the gospel of Satan. There's no more forgiveness. But right now, the blood of Jesus Christ still forgives us of all our sins. Praise the name of our Lord. The blood of Jesus Christ on the altar. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord whereby our prayers in the message the fifth seal. It says notice this. Now, now if there is no altar of sacrifice in heaven, where is the sacrifice for sin laying? Then, the lamb. There has to be a place where the slain lamb blood is laying there where the blood is. Now the incense and the order staff that they burnt which the Bible said was the prayers of the saints. If there was no sacrifice on the altar, then the prayers cannot be received. &gt;&gt; It's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that let the prayers go through to God. Praise the name of our Lord. He answers us because there is blood on the altar. Praise the name of our Lord. The masses seat has blood. But time is going to reach where the masses seat will become the judgment seat and that's the time when the rapture takes place. There will be no more salvation of Gentiles because the Bible says he that is filthy let him be filthy still. He that is righteous let him be righteous still. But right now, as long as the rapture has not taken place, the blood of Jesus Christ, praise the name of our Lord, still covers the earth like that vision brother Brham saw, you know, when he saw the blood of Jesus Christ up upon the earth that every sin just gets into that blood to hold the wrath of God from coming down because there are people God wants to redeem. Praise the name of Lord. He desires us to reach his perfection. He desires us to be like our Lord Jesus Christ. So the blood is still on the altar to bring us into the image of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go back that message. The bleach he says, &gt;&gt; "I've got a red spot on my hand and cover it with white." If I have got a red spot and then cover it with white. The red spot is still there. It is still there. But God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin. It was the blood of his own son that when our confessed sin drops into God's bleach, try to find it again. The coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and through the time until it hits the accuser Satan it on him until the day of judgment. So there is the blood of Jesus Christ. So now what we are required to do &gt;&gt; is confess your sin by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so the sin that you have confessed, that blood of Jesus Christ is a bleach, you know, it removes it. &gt;&gt; Like now we have for example bleaching agents For example, like jig. &gt;&gt; So when you put jig on a white cloth which has got a spot, a black spot, that black spot is dissolved. So even the the the blood of Jesus Christ when you drop sin in the blood of Jesus Christ that blood takes away the elements of sin and then gets it back to Satan. Praise the name of Lord. You are not counted for that sin. But that sin is counted on Satan because he's the one who caused you to do that sin. Praise the name of Lord. That's how the blood of Jesus Christ works. So then you need to confess your sin. Praise the name of our Lord. You need to tell God, Lord, this is why I'm failing. Praise the name of God. And then Christ takes it back on the account of Satan. And when confessing is confessed, and been dipped into a man or woman that has been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ, it kills all symptoms and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him till the day of judgment. where his eternal destination will be thrown into the lake of fire and the chasm is breached and never to come into remembrance anymore and a man stands justified as a son of God. Praise the name of God. That's what the blood of Jesus Christ does. It reconciles us back to the father. It puts us back into fellowship. Praise the name of our Lord. So you shouldn't allow sin to hold you back because our sins are forgiven. Praise the name of the Lord. You just have to accept the sacrifice. You just have to accept the propitation for our sin. Praise the name of Lord. Now you know the devil is so cunning. He can make you doubt your forgiveness of sins. Now in 1 John chapter 2 and then verse one he says, "My little children, these things write I unto you that you sin not. Praise the name of our Lord." Now the Bible says I write unto you that you sin not. But that's not the end of the scripture. So he says, "I don't support you to sin. Don't sin. Don't go away from God. Don't unbelieve God. Don't do things contrary to God." And then he says, And if any man sin, that's not the end of that man. He says we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous. So he says, don't sin, but then if you sin, we have an advocate. In other words, we have the blood of Jesus Christ that is ready to remove our sins. Praise the name of our Lord. And he is the propetition for our sins and not ours only, but also the sins of the whole world. Praise the name of our Lord. So we have the blood of Jesus Christ and by the blood of Jesus Christ our sins are all forgiven. So what is my responsibility? Take your sin in the blood of Jesus Christ. Confess your sin before God. You know, just like the prodigal son, he left his father. And then now when he was in a far country and he came to his realization, he came to understand his condition. He accepted his mistake. The things he was going through made him realize that he's in a terrible condition. Then he remembered his father. So what did he do? He he he determined and said let me go back to my father. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go to Luke chapter 15 and verse 17. The Bible says &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 17 verse 7 Luke 15:1 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger. Praise the name of our Lord. He left his father. He left the influence of his father. He deserted the support of his father. So he went into a far country and he wasted his life. And the devil is always cunning. He can make somebody do something wrong. And then that somebody says, "Ah, let me leave Ginger." And then he goes to a place where nobody knows where he's going. And then he says, "Now I'm free. I can do whatever I want to. I can go into gambling. I can go maybe marry another wife. I can start something different. Nobody knows me here. But always a child of God. God will reach that place like he visited that country with famine and everything got over. So you can get somebody's living in that far country. sickness comes, poverty comes and all those people who are around him just say this man is cast. Yeah, let me go back to my parents. So and so came back but he's not doing well, you know. So that's what that happening to this prodigal son. By the time he came back, he's he was dressed in rugs. He was just completely disorganized life. But he said, "Let me go back to my father." So he said, the Bible said he came to himself and the Holy Spirit will always bring conviction in our heart when we do something wrong before God and then you say, "Where has my peace gone? Where has my joy gone?" You find something that's not right in your life and you try to track back what have I done which is wrong. What have I said which is wrong? What have I thought which is wrong? You are trying to get back that you can restore the joy of your salvation. So he said, "I will arise and I will go to my father and I will say unto my father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee." He understood his condition. So even praise the name of our we need to acknowledge. You know, you you come to realization and then you admit this is my mistake. This is my wrong. And then you fully turn back to God. Praise the name of our Lord. And the Bible says when he went his father received him. Praise the name of Lord. Let us go to Psalms 51. Psalms 51 and then we start reading from verse four. &gt;&gt; Let us start from verse three. &gt;&gt; He says verse two, wash me. Okay, let's start from verse one. He says, "Have mercy upon me, oh God, according to thy loving kindness, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, Psalms 51 teaches you how to repent. Praise the name of our Lord. How can you get reconciled back to God? You've been doing something wrong. There's something troubling you in your life. And so, David had committed adultery and he had also killed. It took a whole year and you know there are people who can live in sin for a period of time and is as if nothing has happened. Praise the name of our Lord and then God sends prophet Nathan to tell David there is this thing you have done which is wrong. And so David, never argued about his sin. David admitted his sin and said, "Lord have mercy upon me." Then the prophet told him, "God has forgiven you your sin." Now in the self-righteousness of David when he was told about a certain man in a parable he said that man should die but now the mercies of God came down David repented and God told David you are not going to die praise the name of our Lord and that's what the Bible says he has not judged us according to our sins because God is longsuffering. God has a lot of mercy for us. Now there are people who are always judgmental about others. Anything small, they want to pass judgment. Even for themselves, they want to pass judgment. And you know they say now this one I cannot go back. This one I cannot be accepted. This one I cannot be forgiven. Praise the name of our Lord. You need to take tonight the blood of Jesus Christ. Reit all our sins. It doesn't matter what you have done. Praise the name of our Lord. The blood of Jesus Christ is here to have all our sins forgiven. Praise the name of our Lord. So you don't go and then just completely give up. Praise the name of our Lord. Here David said, "Lord, have mercy upon me. According to your loving kindness, according to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions." Praise the name of our Lord. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me against you. And you only have I sinned and done this evil in your sight, that you may be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge. Behold, I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. Praise the name of our Lord. Learn to confess your sin before the Lord. Apply the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, this is where my weakness is. Lord, this is where my trespass is. Wash me. Deliver me from this kind of situation. Praise the name of our Lord. Use the blood of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of our Lord. So David admitted his weakness and then he confessed and called upon the name of the Lord and the Lord forgave him of his sin and that is the same thing when the prodical son came back to the father he was forgiven praise the name of and that's the same thing we did also to do Lord I'm coming back Lord I want to be reconciled with you. Lord, I want to walk in the path you have prepared for me. Praise the name of Isaiah 1 verse 16. The Bible says, "Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes to do evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow. Come now and let us reason together, says the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. praise the name of our Lord. He says, "Come and let us reason together." So you come to God. &gt;&gt; And you know when you come to God, &gt;&gt; don't come with yourself righteousness. The Bible gives an ex a parable of two people who went to the temple. One was a Pharisee. When he went to the temple, he started talking about his righteousness and say, you know, the Bible says he would lift his head high. Oh Lord, I thank you. I fast two times a week. I touch everything. And then he started despising another. I'm not like the other one. And then the other publican bowed down himself and said, Lord have mercy upon me. And then the Bible says the publican went back home justified more than the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; So now when you come to the Lord, you imagine Daniel could do everything he felt he would do which was right. praying in the morning, praying in the afternoon, praying in the evening, even when they were still young. You know, the Bible says they could not defile themselves with the food of the land, he was honestly depending upon God. But when he came to the presence of God, he started confessing saying, "Lord have mercy upon us. We have been rebellious. We have not been hearing what the word says. We have not been obeying what the word tells us to do. Come before God. Confess your weaknesses. Say, "Lord, every time I'm doing something which is wrong, I'm thinking something which is wrong, wash me by the blood of Jesus. Forgive me for my failures. Forgive me for my mistakes. Every time somebody criticizes me, I criticize back. I abuse them. I don't wish them good because all the time Satan wants to make sure that you are always contrary to the way of the Lord in your thoughts in your speech in your action. Praise the name of our Lord. So that when you come before the Lord, Lord wash me. Praise the name of our Lord. Like when you look at the scriptures in the Old Testament, they had daily sacrifices. Every day they had a cleansing process. Praise the name of our Lord. We also have some kind of like daily dedication to the Lord. In the morning, you rise up and thank the Lord for the day he has given you. commit that hold into the hands of the Lord. Lord, lead me through this day. Lead me through this day, the victories. Sometimes you don't know the temptations that are waiting you at your place of work. or the trials that are along the road like maybe you are moving on the road, you know, and then somebody just comes and annoys you, you end up abusing that person or feeling bad about that person or somebody hurts you or you expect this person to do this kind of thing. You expect somebody to do something and then they don't do it. So all the time you find that you are battling. Your spirit is always troubled coming up. Every time something else is coming up. You need to have time and see that that is washed away. Praise the name of Lord deliver me from this kindness. Every day see that there is a cleansing. There is a washing. There is a separation from those things. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go to the book of John. John chapter 20 &gt;&gt; and then verse 23. &gt;&gt; Soever sins you remit they are remitted unto them. And soever sins you retain they are retained. John chapter 20 verse 23. Now he was telling the disciples to remit sins. Now what the Catholic Church thinks or says the church can remit sins. But that's not true. Now, the remission of sins comes by the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Now when somebody accepts the gospel and obeys what the word of God is telling him to do, then their sins are remitted. But if they reject the gospel, their sins are retained. Praise the name of our Lord. And so it's also the same thing now with us. Now we have the message of the hour. Praise the name of our Lord. And so sin is unbelief. Unbelief in the message that God has given to us. Unbelief in the word that God has given to us in John chapter 16. And then in verse 7 to verse 9, he says, "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it's expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me. Because unbelief is what sin is. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is sin. Praise the name of our Lord. When God told them, don't eat of the tree, they didn't believe him, so they sinned. Praise the name of our Lord. So now when they sinned then the attributes of sin come out of that adultery, &gt;&gt; fornication, lying. So sin is unbelief in the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. In John chapter 3 and then verse 18, he that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. Now you see that in the days of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; they were priests, they were Pharisees, they were scribes, men that you would write about their lives and you don't get anything done which was wrong in their life. like the other man when he went to the temple he says I don't do anything evil like the rich young ruler when he came to the Lord Jesus Christ and then the Lord told him about the commandments do not do not do this do not do this he said all those things I've done from my childhood but what lth I he had been doing the commandments. But he saw that there is something that was lacking in him. He lacked eternal life. The Pharisees, we are following the law to the dot. But now when the Lord Jesus Christ comes, when the Lord Jesus Christ comes, you know the fulfillment of all the law, they didn't believe in him. And then he says, your sin remains. Sin is unbelief. So he says, he that believeth not on him It doesn't matter how much you've kept the law. If you don't believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you perish in your sins. Praise the name of Lord. So believing whom the Lord has sent, praise the name of is what remits our sins. because that is having faith in what the Lord is doing. Praise the name of our Lord. So, whoever didn't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ perished in their sin. Praise the name of our Lord. And so, we have also had seven church age message. Every church had its own message. Every age has its word for that day. And the message that was sent is where the atonement laid. Praise the name of our Lord. Because right now the way we read in the scriptures in John chapter one, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God AND THE WORD WAS GOD. Then in verse 14 of John chapter one became flesh. Why did the word become flesh? That the word can shed blood. Praise the name of OUR LORD. BECAUSE WITHOUT THE THE BODY, there wouldn't be any blood. Now, God had to put on body in order to to pour out blood which washes away our sins. And now when he shed his blood, the Bible says we are redeemed by the blood of God in Acts 20 verse 28. Praise the name of our Lord. Now that blood of God has now become the word of God. Before in the beginning it was the word and then the word became the blood and now the blood is now the word. Praise the name of our lord. So the word that is given to us in our age is where we find the blood and that's where we find forgiveness of ours. Praise the name of God. So the rich young ruler much as he would keep the commandments but when he rejected the word of his day he perished in his sins. Praise the name of our Lord. So we see the same thing that's happening now. Atonement, forgiveness of our sins is right where the message of the hour is. Praise the name of Lord. That's where we can find forgiveness of our sins. Because sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what? In the word of God. Praise the name of Lord. Whoever didn't believe the message of Noah in the days of Noah when God told them go in the ark and they said Noah you an old man you are just joking I don't care your ark I'll have another alternative all those who didn't hear the message of Noah they perished in their sins they perished in their unbelief. Praise the name of our Lord. Even now, we have the message of the hour. So, we do well to obey the message of the hour. That's where the forgiveness of sins are. That's where you can get rid of unbelief. So, you take the word of God seriously. Praise the name of our Lord. When the message says this, take it as the word of God. When the rich young was told, "Go and sell what you have," that was the word of God. When he refused it, he perished. Praise the name of our Lord. So, we have the message of the day and that's the message that we take now. where there is forgiveness of our sins. &gt;&gt; Now in John chapter 3 verse 36, he says, "He that believeth on the Son has everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. Praise the name of God. He says, "He that believeth on the Son has eternal life, but he that does not believe. The wrath of God abides on him." We have the message of the hour that that returns our heart or turns our hearts back to the fathers. So it's always good to stand by the message. That's where you can overcome unbelief. Outside of the message of the hour, you'll be unbeliever. Praise the name of our Lord. So the confession of our sins, our unbelief, the message guides us. Praise the name of our Lord. You know all the denomination churches are sayingd. But what are they getting saved from if they deny the council of God? Praise the name of our Lord. The message that the Lord has given unto us. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, it's just like a plant. When a plant is growing, it's all green. the different stages of justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Spirit, you know, justification, you know, maybe just as two leaves, then sanctification, you know, like a tassel or flower and then, you know, baptism of the Holy Spirit, restoration of gifts, a shark. But then inside the shark there is the seed. And now when all the life when the seed matures, all the life goes into the seed and all the other plant becomes dry. And this is the time we're living in that life is in the seat which is the message of the hour. Praise the name of so we need to see that we take it serious. Obey the message of the hour. Obey the word of God. What God has revealed to us. Praise the name of our Lord. What God was doing in the ministry of brother Brham. was a proof that this is the word that the Lord has given us today. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's where there is forgiveness of our sins. It's where the bleeding blood is. Praise the name of our Lord. Our sins are forgiven when we live in the message of the hour covered by the blood of Jesus. Praise the name of our Lord. Like in the Old Testament, the animal life would not come back. But in the New Testament, the life of Jesus Christ comes back to the worshiper. Praise the name of our Lord. So a proof that my sins have been forgiven. I get the life of Jesus Christ and that should always be our desire. Lord, I desire to live your life. Praise the name of our Lord. Living the life of Jesus Christ at your home. You're living that life at your place of work. You're living that life where you study from. You're living that life among the strangers where they don't know you. Still live the life of Jesus Christ. May God bless you. Amen. [applause] On Friday, we are going to have an overnight. Praise the name of our Lord. And on Sunday, we shall have two services. The morning service is for all of us. But then the afternoon is for the youth out of school. Amen. Let us sing that song. Give me all as each of us pray goodness. Give me all in my lamb.
