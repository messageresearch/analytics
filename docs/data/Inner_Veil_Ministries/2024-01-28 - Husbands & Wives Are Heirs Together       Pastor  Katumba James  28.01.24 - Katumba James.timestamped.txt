[15:47] Lord and we surely confess we are going

[15:54] Lord we call upon your name again this
[15:57] afternoon
[15:59] that Lord you may come and speak to
[16:01] us the things that you've ordained for
[16:04] us this
[16:05] afternoon press upon this meeting Lord
[16:09] grant to meet the needs of all your
[16:12] children may the glory and honor be back
[16:15] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:18] we pray and ask
[16:20] this amen we turn to our
[16:24] Bibles First Peter chapter
[16:27] 3
[16:29] reading verse 7 to verse
[16:33] 9 the Bible
[16:35] says likewise ye husbands dwell with
[16:39] them according to knowledge giving honor
[16:42] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[16:45] and as being haers together of the grace
[16:48] of life that your prayers be not
[16:54] [Music]
[16:57] hindered
[17:12] finally be of one mind having compassion
[17:16] one of another love as Brethren be
[17:19] pitiful be
[17:27] courtious
[17:35] not rendering evil for evil or ring for
[17:37] ring but cont wise blessing knowing that
[17:41] you are they are AR called that you
[17:44] should inherit a
[17:57] blessing
[18:05] amen and God blessing of his word you
[18:08] may be
[18:09] seated so I want to preach this
[18:12] afternoon husband and wife are hairs
[18:17] together praise the name of the Lord the
[18:21] husband and the wife are hairs
[18:26] together praise the name of Lord so when
[18:29] we read in verse
[18:31] S it says husbands dwell with them
[18:35] according to
[18:40] knowledge giving honor unto the
[18:43] wife as unto a weaker
[18:47] vessel and as being HS together of the
[18:51] grace of
[18:55] life that your prayers be not Hind
[19:00] that praise the name of the Lord so you
[19:04] look at this
[19:06] scripture it says that the husband and
[19:08] the
[19:10] wife they hairs
[19:14] together hairs of the grace of
[19:18] life that means that God blesses you
[19:24] together praise the name of the Lord God
[19:28] blesses you
[19:30] together and you see when God is calling
[19:33] a
[19:34] man and the man is
[19:37] married even the wife partakes of that
[19:42] calling now when we go in the message
[19:44] possessing all
[19:48] things praise the name of our Lord he
[19:52] says and right here we could
[19:55] start I believe that when God calls the
[19:58] man to
[19:59] service if he is a married
[20:02] man he has a help
[20:05] meet he calls his wife with
[20:09] him because they two are
[20:13] one praise the name of our Lord so now
[20:16] when God called
[20:18] Abraham leave the land of and come to
[20:21] the land I show
[20:23] you Abraham didn't leave Sarah
[20:26] behind because Sarah was part of
[20:31] Abraham Sarah was a hair with
[20:35] Abraham so then when Abraham moved
[20:38] out he went with his
[20:41] wife praise the name of our Lord and see
[20:44] even when you are
[20:46] living or when you stay in a place you
[20:50] stay together you eat of the same
[20:53] food you share of the same Sorrows many
[20:57] times
[20:58] if one is sorrowful you can't be
[21:01] happy because it affects
[21:04] you and when you get children they are
[21:08] both your
[21:09] children so now as husband and wife you
[21:13] know they are hairs
[21:15] together anything that God comes to
[21:18] bless the
[21:20] family every body is
[21:23] blessed partakes of that same
[21:26] blessing so then he says still in that
[21:29] message possessing all
[21:35] things and so wherever we find later
[21:39] on that God possibly would have killed
[21:43] Sarah when she doubted the Angel's
[21:47] message 25 years
[21:50] later when they were sitting under the
[21:52] oak that
[21:54] day and when she left when the angel
[21:57] told her
[22:00] oh told
[22:01] Abraham that she was going to be a
[22:04] mother and sah left within
[22:09] herself how could I
[22:12] old 0 years old and her husband 100
[22:17] years
[22:18] old her womb had been dried up for years
[22:22] her womb had been dried up for
[22:26] years and the body was was as good as
[22:30] de then how could she ever have pleasure
[22:33] with her husband
[22:36] again she
[22:41] laughed and the angel with the back
[22:44] turned to the
[22:49] tent why did
[22:51] sah and she denied it now that's telling
[22:55] God to his face that is wrong
[23:02] and that would have took her
[23:04] life but God could not take
[23:07] Sarah because she was a part of
[23:12] Abraham and she was in the convenant
[23:14] with
[23:16] him so she had to go with
[23:19] him so he could not take Abraham
[23:23] S without taking part of Abraham
[23:28] for these two are
[23:30] one praise the name of our Lord so Sarah
[23:33] had made a
[23:34] mistake but then because she was part of
[23:39] Abraham then God would not take
[23:43] Sarah they were
[23:45] joined they were hairs together they
[23:49] were become one and that's now the same
[23:52] thing we need to
[23:54] consider your husband or your wife
[23:58] that you are part of
[24:01] him she is part of you so then whatever
[24:06] things that you
[24:07] desire whatever thing that you desire
[24:10] for
[24:11] yourself you need to desire it also for
[24:14] the
[24:15] other praise the name of our Lord and
[24:18] that's how you can be happy in
[24:21] marriage if you want your husband to be
[24:23] good to
[24:25] you then are you good to your husband
[24:28] if you want your wife to be good to you
[24:31] then are you good to your wife you need
[24:34] to keep give consideration to one
[24:37] another because God has made you
[24:41] one praise the name of our Lord so you
[24:44] should be able to
[24:45] know that this thing will hurt my
[24:48] husband or this thing will hurt my wife
[24:51] and then you learn how to consider one
[24:55] another and the Bible says one
[25:00] another in other words desire more for
[25:03] your husband or for your
[25:07] wife and then you'll have peace at home
[25:10] and then you'll see these differences
[25:12] don't really just come up like
[25:14] that you are able to bear with one
[25:18] another praise the name of our Lord so
[25:21] then it is important that we move
[25:24] together as a family unit
[25:28] and you know sometimes the devil would
[25:30] always want bring things that separate
[25:34] you but there are more things that unite
[25:37] you than what separates you so then you
[25:41] don't look at the things that brings
[25:46] division the thing that put you off from
[25:48] the
[25:49] other but then you try as much as
[25:53] possible to be reconciled to the
[25:56] other
[25:58] and so the Bible says having
[26:01] compassion one for another in other
[26:05] words when you have compassion for the
[26:07] other you are not so much looking at
[26:10] their
[26:11] weaknesses you're not so much looking at
[26:13] their
[26:14] fail but you know you are able to stand
[26:16] in the Gap you are able to stand in
[26:19] their
[26:20] position and then you are considerate of
[26:23] each
[26:24] other and this is how you know you can
[26:26] run your marriage
[26:28] and then you'll see God has given you
[26:30] Grace from one year two years and the
[26:34] time keeps on going until you find that
[26:37] you can't be
[26:40] yourself you can't be alone you feel you
[26:43] are
[26:44] missing praise the name of our Lord you
[26:47] feel that you are missing a part of
[26:51] you praise the name of our Lord like
[26:54] this week last week on
[26:55] Tuesday we took our young daughter es to
[26:58] boarding
[27:02] school and now when we left her
[27:05] there I felt a part of me is not
[27:09] around until now in the night you were
[27:11] thinking how did she
[27:14] sleep she has never been away from her
[27:17] parents and then the whole day I was
[27:22] thinking I think when we get back home
[27:25] we need to call the met and find and
[27:27] talk to and find out how she
[27:29] is it's just something that becomes part
[27:32] of
[27:33] you that when they take it away you feel
[27:37] there is some kind of
[27:40] Gap and that should be the concern of
[27:42] the husband and the wife if you are not
[27:45] there with your wife you are concerned
[27:47] how is she and even sometimes they will
[27:50] ask you hey did you
[27:53] eat praise the name of the Lord have you
[27:56] had the meal
[27:59] you know you are
[28:01] concerned praise the name of our Lord
[28:03] you know you are concerned about
[28:06] another because you have become so much
[28:08] part of each
[28:11] other so the Bible says we should have
[28:13] compassion one for
[28:17] another love as
[28:21] Brethren praise the name of our Lord
[28:23] love as
[28:25] Brethren you know like the sometimes
[28:28] when this one happens especially
[28:31] among young
[28:35] women you know they just want to go to
[28:37] the bathroom
[28:40] together you know they they just feel
[28:42] like even clothes they keep on
[28:45] changing this one wears the others the
[28:48] other wears the other you know there is
[28:51] that kind of
[28:53] connection that you know they just want
[28:55] to move together what are you going to
[28:57] eat today they want also to eat the same
[29:00] where would you want to go they also
[29:02] want to be there there is that kind of
[29:05] feeling of being together in
[29:09] everything and then until some of them
[29:12] even when they are going to
[29:13] school you will take me to the school of
[29:15] this one you know there is a closeness
[29:18] that comes
[29:20] in and now that should be the bond that
[29:22] we have in our
[29:24] families as husband and the wife you
[29:27] know you are so much
[29:29] concerned you may have this thing you
[29:32] like but then you know your mind is what
[29:35] will my husband think about
[29:37] this what does my husband like what does
[29:41] my life my wife like what will interest
[29:44] my wife what will make her happy and
[29:48] then you work out towards
[29:50] that and then the Bible says a married
[29:54] man let us go to First Corinthians chap
[30:01] 7 1 Corinthians chapter
[30:12] 7 and then we read in
[30:15] verse
[30:26] can
[30:36] I
