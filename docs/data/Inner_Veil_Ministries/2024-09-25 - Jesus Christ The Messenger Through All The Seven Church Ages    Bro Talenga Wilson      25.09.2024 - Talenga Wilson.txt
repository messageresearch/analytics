may you speak to our hearts that Lord our our lives may be edified in Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen it's such old evening amen but we thank God for his grace that we are finally here amen let's get on our feet and now that we are very few I would request that we we come and up the front amen amen so let's get our Bibles and turn to the Book of Revelations amen chapter one amen and we shall pick up from verse 9 amen amen let us read I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the is that is called for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and had behind me great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega first and last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the church the seven churches which are in Asia in Asia sad Philadelphia Andia and I turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the mid of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man closed with a garment down to the foot and got about the PS with a golden may the Lord a blessing the reading of his word we may all be seated amen I want to welcome once again amen and I want to pick pick it from where we we started from on Wednesday last week where we saw Jesus Christ being the Alpha and the Omega amen describing himself in the scripture as the first and the last the beginning and the end praise the name of the Living God and now here we saw when John was telling us what he saw the Bible says that when he was in the spirit he heard behind him a great voice and he describes it as of a trumpet praise the Lord and this is what the voice spoke to him says I am Al and I'm Omega the first and the last and said the things that you see write them in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia praise the Lord And now when John turn to see the voice that spoke with him the Bible says being turned to see the voice that spake with me when he turned praise the Lord he did not turn to see the person that was speaking but he turned to see the voice that spoke to him and he says when he turned he what he saw he saw seven go gold candlesticks and in the midst of these seven golden candlesticks he saw one like unto the son of man closed with a gar down to the foot praise the Lord and now the scriptures describe him that when he was speaking to him to John he said I am the Al and the Omega praise the Lord the beginning and the end and now that means before him he was confirming that before him there was none and after him there was still none praise the Lord and now he's here in the mid of the seven golden candlesticks and now the Bible says he spoke to John and said the things that you hear write them and send them to the seven Church ages praise the Lord and now we see that this is Jesus Christ praise the Lord the Alpha and the Omega and now he's in the midd of the seven golden candlesticks praise the Lord which are the seven Church ages praise the Lord and the B if you continue down there like we saw last week that he has seven stars which are The Messengers The Seven Church ages and then he started giving the message to deliver the message to the to each of the ages to the first age the first church Ephesus he said right praise the Lord and again the second age says Philadelphia Andia so to each of the ages there was a message being sent out praise the Lord the purpose of this message was to Reve Jesus Christ each of thees amen amen so now the Bible says write the things that you have seen and send them out that is the voice that he turned to see praise the Lord the voice that he turned to see instructed him to get the things that he saw and heard then them to each of the stars that were in his right hand so now we see that Jesus who was in the midst of these Church ages he held the Seven Stars he held the Seven Stars and he was sending them out [Music] amen Amina amen am what so now he had he got the message and gave the message to each of the messengers to go and reveal Christ in each of the ages for our text tonight the title is Jesus Christ the messenger through all the Seven Ages praise the Living God so now if we go back to a little history we know that God praise the Lord sent Jesus Christ in form of a body when he wanted to redeem us back to himself when he wanted to reconcile Us Praise the Lord he had to make a body the body in form of Jesus Christ when he sent the angel to Mary and he spoke to Mary that would bear a son and his name would be called Jesus praise the Lord the Son of God so now God made himself a body in order to come and Deliver us to save us from sin so he condescended praise the Lord and He tled himself in the body as Emmanuel Son of God and he came and did suffer and then he was crucified and then he resected when he resected praise on the third day he met the people he met the disciples he met them he made the disciples and gave them instructions and then he told them that he would come he would send a promise he would come in form of the Holy Spirit to instruct the church to guide them through the truth praise the Lord so again when he are sended up on the day of Pentecost again descended into the church to teach the church and to instruct the church through the truth because he says when the Holy Spirit is come he shall guide you through all truth and now here when he's revealing himself to John as the alha and Omega the beginning and the end now he says write the things that you're going to hear and send them to each of the churches praise the Lord and he started with the first Ag and the church at Ephesus right and John wrote down and he sent that message and he sent it to the church at Ephesus and search the church at Min then joh wrote it sent it to the church at Min each of those church has a messenger each of the churches had a messenger praise the Lord and now who are this messenger these Messengers and nothing else but Jesus Jesus Christ prise the lord called in this men in order to reveal him to the church praise the Lord each of the messengers were men who were veils and behind those veils was Jesus Christ himself revealing himself the rest of the church praise the Lord that's why I titled it Jesus Christ the messenger through all the seven Church ages praise the Lord so now when he tabernacled himself when he came down praise the Lord he now took the form of man so he takes up the body of a man to bring his mind to the the rest of the people not in a glorified body but in a body just as we are so all the Seven Stars that we are that we are in his right hand praise the Lord those were men that God had picked that God had Chosen and he instructed each of them with a special message to each of the churches praise the Lord and now the prophet says here he says that when Jesus was dying upon the cross he cried and when he was praying he says father into thine hands I command my spirit and here the prophet says when he said that he T the life of of the life out of Christ God told life out of Christ he he took the body and set it on his right hand and then he sent the Holy Ghost back to the church which is the UN which is the unconditional Covenant [Music] [Music] given to man tonight the life of Jesus Christ must be in every individual that is God Covenant and as sure as you are born of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost is in you God is under statement that he raise you up in the last days he will heal the sickness praise the Lord so here the prophet is trying to tell us and when he took up the body of Jesus praise the Living God he told the body and when he tore the body he got the body of Christ and set it upon his right hand and then he got the Holy Spirit and sent it back to the church praise the Lord for one purpose praise the Lord to guide the church to teach the church to reveal Christ to the church so now when he was speaking to each of the Messengers he came down praise the Lord and then he indwelled in each of these Messengers praise the Lord he tabernacled himself in each of the messengers and then he came to speak his word to the people in each of the ages so now we notice that all those Messengers The Messengers that were sent each of the church churches and the message that They Carried was to reveal Jesus Christ to the people praise the name Living God and now we see him standing in the midst of the churches we see him standing in the middle of the church speaking to the church speaking to each of the ages Lord and he had made himself these Stars he had made himself praise the Lord he had created for himself these vessels to express himself into them praise the Lord such that when they stand out to speak when they are speaking they are not speaking words of themselves but they are speak speaking that which they have heard of the father so now the message right from Ephesus toia is revealing Jesus Christ praise the Lord why because it is Christ himself speaking through these Messengers that's why the message of Paul in the first church age the same message that William and preached praise the Lord why because he's the alpha and he's the Omega he was in the beginning with with Paul in the first church and he spoke to Paul and he gave him the instructions and he gave him the message and Paul spoke the message Paul instructed the church he told the church through all the truth he told the church he called The Church repentance he rebuked sin and he told the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he told that man should first of all repent and when man believes and they confess and they baptized they shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord and when will came he never taugh anything different from what Paul taugh he also rebukes he also told the people that they must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and they receive the gift of the Holy Spirit why because Paul heard from The Voice William and Bram heard from the same voice is Jesus Christ himself speaking to the churches praise the name of the Living God and now in the message sadan San Church H now we can see that Jesus Christ is revealing himself Through the Ages by his Spirit In The Messengers they are just as Moses was to the children of Israel as he had Revelation for so as he had Revelation for his day so each messenger had God's revelation and Ministry for that day so just like Moses he had the Revelation and the re he had reation he had was to redeem the children of Israel moved them from Egypt to the promised land that is the message he had praise the Lord for his day that is the that was purpose of God he could not reveal Jesus he could not Reve the birth of Jesus he could not teach them about baptism the message that God gave to him was a message to move the people from Egypt to Canaan and he says that God did the same thing to each of the messengers each messenger had God's revelation of them received God's revelation and the ministry for that day that's when we see the messengers are in his hand we see the Lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power praise the Lord it is not enough that he has Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing among the seven golden Lambs no is it even enough that we see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors for each for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the L but the CL group shepherds are are wrong as well then God brings himself on the scene as the Sheep Shepherd so we see what the prophet is telling us here Christ praise the Lord he gave each of the messengers a message because in each of the of the churches the people went astray so God had to send a voice God had to send a message to bring the people back to himself in each of the ages so the purpose of this was to bring the people back to God recile the people back to God praise the Lord so he said in each of the ages that people went AR even the Shepherds went as then God brings himself on the sea as the Sheep Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth his ultimate purpose in each of the Ages was to bring the people back to the truth praise the name of the Living God so we see Christ himself coming coming down God himself coming on the sea in the ministries of these men the seven golden the Seven Stars The Messengers to each age God comes down praise the Lord he comes into these men and then he starts rebuking the generation he rebukes the church he rebukes them of sin then asks them to repent praise the Lord then he brings them back to the truth from Ephesus he rebuked them and turned them to the truth in sadness he rebuked them and brought them back the truth to Philadelphia toia he rebukes them and brings them to the truth it is the same God Walking Through the Ages to reconcile us and bring us back to the truth praise the name of the Living God is the same Christ revealing himself to the bride in each age and doing the work of calling out by way of rebuking cleansing and preparing the church and preparing the bride in each of those ages for eternity praise the Lord and then Through The Messengers the church is able to receive Jesus Christ praise the Lord by which he expresses himself then he comes All Through the Ages praise the lord we see him when he spoke Through the Ages then now he comes down to the seals which bring down his secrets that had been hidden from the foundation of the world the same Jesus praise the lord we see him in the Revelation chapter 5 when the angel when John said I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back site sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worth open the book and to lose the seals there and no man in heaven on Earth nether under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there own praise the Lord so when John saw the book on the thr the book having Seven Seals he had the angel proclaiming who worthy and he says there was no man in heaven on Earth that was able to open the book nether look there own and he wept because no one was worthy and verse five says and one of the ERS said unto me weep not the same Jesus that was in the middle of the seven golden candles instructing the church through all the ages is the same Jesus that we see coming down and taking the seals and revealing them to the church praise the Lord no one was worthy except himself and says Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed open the book and lose the seals [Music] thereof and I beheld and in the midst of the throne and of the fasts and in the midst of the elders St a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God praise the Lord which are the seven spirits praise the Lord which he sent into the Earth to instruct the church to guide the church to bring theur church back to the truth it is still Christ who had the seven [Applause] hnes and the Seven's eyes which are the seven spirits Christ praise the Lord back to the church to reveal the secrets to reveal the seals to each of the church ages and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four and the four and and 20 Elders fell down before the [Music] lamb having every one of them HS and golden FS full of oers which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us unto God and has redeemed has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred so the same Jesus praise the Lord the same Alpha and Omega the same that was in the midst of the church ages even through all the church ages he is the same praise the Lord that had a power to redeem that had the power praise the Lord redeem the book from the judge so he here who the power to redeem us unto God that's why they all suang a new song say to take the book and open the seals there are of because you were slain and now you have redeemed us to God by your own blood and you've made us unto our God Kings and Priests so now we see Christ praise the Lord once again condescending coming down into the church praise the Lord when he came down to each of the church ages he never came once and left but when he comes through the messengers he gives them a message to take to the people and when the people receive this message they are receiving Jesus Christ and when they accept the message praise the Lord when they believe the message of their day they are receiving Jesus Christ and when you receive Jesus Christ praise the Lord and you accept him and you confess him and you repent of your sins and you are baptized then receive the new birth Christ himself he comes to indell in the person so now it ceases to be a group aair because when he sent the messengers he sent the messengers to the church which is a group of people praise the Lord he sent the Messengers full age which had so many people but now when The Messengers come down with a particular message this message goes down to any individual person so it is upon us as individuals to receive the message and believe it because when Christ comes he comes to deal with us on individual basis praise the name of the Living God and now when he comes to deal with us on individual basis now that's when we receive the new birth and the new birth is Christ himself praise the Lord he has separated you and set you apart and he has cleansed you by the preaching of the word and when you're worthy and you're fully cleansed he indwells himself and he makes an abort in your soul by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then he begins to guide us he begins to teach you the Bible says he guides us through all truth it now begins to be an individual praise the Lord he has revealed himself to the edge but each person in every age must receive him as an individual each person in every age must come into that person experience with the word of God being revealed in their day and the people in the age of Paul had to receive Christ individually the same with us in this age each of us must receive Christ as an individual it becomes an individual affair because he has condescended and now he has himself in the words praise the Lord in the message of the messenger and now through the message we are able to receive him as individuals why salvation to us Gentiles is not a group Affair it is an individual fair and each of us must hear when we hear each of us must receive Jesus Christ personally it doesn't matter whether my father is a preacher whether my father is the messenger of this age I must receive Jesus personally that's when you become born again when you receive Jesus Christ personally because when he condescended on the day of Pentecost he came and indwelled each one of them that were in the upper room praise the Lord he never took over the whole church but he came and sat on each one of them it was an individual Affair praise the Lord they shouted and said you're worthy you're worthy because you have taken the book and you're worthy to open the seals you were killed and by your blood you have redeemed us unto God praise the Lord by his own blood he redeems each one of us unto God and the Bible says and you've made us to our god Kings and Priests how does he make us unto our God Kings and Priests it has to be through the new birth praise the Lord it has to be through the new when you receive the Holy Spirit you receive the new birth then he becomes a part of you and become a part of him praise the Lord and the prophet says in the message identification now in so doing when he was slain he took our place when he was slain he took my personality when he was slain he took my entire life he replaced it with his by the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord because when you accept him when you accept the message for your day you receive Jesus Christ and when you receive him you must be born again and when you are born again and you have received the Life of Christ in you now he takes over your part he takes your place he takes over your life and he sees us to be you but it is Christ that is living so now when he takes over you he takes over your whole life he takes over your weaknesses praise the Lord he takes over your sins he takes over everything about you praise the Lord and then in the fa trials that you your first it is Christ praise the Lord that helps you to overcome in your weaknesses it is Christ that encourages you it is Christ on the inside of you that teaches you the way of God why you become a part of him and has become a part of an individual Affair now praise the Lord and now what proves that we have the right Spirit what proves that we have the spirit in our Edge is accepting the message of our day praise the Lord you cannot say you believe what Paul preached you leave the entire message of Paul praise the Lord and then you reject the message of William Mar Bram praise the Lord there is something wrong because William Bram preached exactly what Paul preached he picked from the same route it was the same person it was the same Jesus who was in the midst over the seven Church ages praise the Lord so what shows that you have the the r spirit is when you accept the message of your day because it aligns perfectly with the message of all other Messengers when Paul preached he preached the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord and you cannot say that you believe the message of Paul when you reject the baptism in the name of the Jesus Christ and how do we test them praise the Lord Willam when he came to preach he preached the message and preached the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember when uh when they received the the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost the same Jesus Christ when he descended once again and he came among the people when they stood out there when Peter was preaching he rebuked the people he rebuked them of sin and told them repent each one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ when he stood out to preach he preached to them Jesus Christ resurrected he preached to them that he was was dead and now he's alive when Paul was preaching he preached Jesus Christ resurrected when Bram was preaching he preached Jesus Christ resurrected and says each one of us must be born again and must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and when we do that we have the gift of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord so believe faith in this message praise the Lord your obedience toward this message entitles us to the New Birth praise the Lord why you accepted Jesus Christ himself praise the Lord because the message of Bram is not his word but it is Christ Jesus himself raling himself to the seventh Church age behold I stand at the door and knock an indid call I stand at the door and knock any man hear my voice when he opens the door I'll come into and he will be with me and I be with him praise the Lord an individual affair he sent first the message and then Bram told the message and then he left the message which is Jesus Christ and then the message he says I stand at the door each one of us has a door each one of us has the soul each one of us has to open the door for Christ to come in and when he comes in he gives us the new birth praise the name of the Living God he now dwells in Us Praise the Lord and now I want us to go down here we notice that when he comes down he takes our place for the Bible says he takes away our iniquity receive his Revelation when we accept his words when we believe the message of our day which is the word of God Jesus Christ comes in and then he takes away our iniquity he takes away our sin and he takes over for the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 ver 21 for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him Praise the Lord so he made him sin he made him sin praise the Lord when he got this body of Jesus Christ and he gave it up at Calvary at the cross to sacrifice him for our sins so he became sin for us yes he knew no sin that we who have accepted him we who have accepted his words we may be made the righteous of God in him through the new birth praise the Lord so now when he takes over he pours himself in Us Praise the Lord and he makes us the righteousness of God but this does not mean that you are free from trials that you are free from TRS we are not free from these TRS as long as we still have these Veil bodies but as long as he still stays on the he says I know I know your weaknesses I know your works I know your history I know your history but I have taken over praise the Lord him taking the form of man replacing us to live in our place to feel our pain praise the Lord to live through our weak to encourage us to fight for us all the battles that we may encounter praise the Lord but still he gives us strength then he fights to overcome because he lives on the inside praise the Lord his purpose is to make sure that you and I are righteous before God that is his purpose that the reason God sent him upon the cross to die for the sins that's the reason he sent him down in the form of the Holy Spirit to come and indwell each one of us to support us through all our weaknesses to arrive each one of us to the state of a perfect man such that we are ready we are worthy when we are presented before God but right now because he sits inside of us he presents himself before God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins he presents himself before God as a sacrifice worthy of all our iniquities praise the name of the Living God so when we stand before God he already recognizes the sacrifice which is Jesus Christ to receive all our petitions and forgive us of all our troubles and forgive us of all our sins and iniquities praise the name of living God and the Bible says the eyes of your understanding in Ephesians 1 verse Verse 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened 118 be the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us what who believe according the working of his mighty power has wrot which he wrote In Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places amen our understanding being enlightened by the truth by the word the spoken word Christ expressed in his word side at the right hand of God above all principality and power and M and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body praise the Lord so now God got all things into Christ and the says he has put all things under his feet not some put all things praise the name of the Living God so now when Christ becomes a part of us when he becomes a part of you praise the Lord he takes over your life and puts all things under his feet all your weaknesses under his feet all things under your subjection says he gave him to be the head of all things to the church which is nothing else but his body praise the Lord fullness of him that fth all in all he has made all things to be under Christ so he has got Christ the word and gave him over to the church to manifest him because the Bible says here that he gave him to be the head of all things to the church which is his body and the church the B is talking about a bunch of people but it is an individual says that we are the Tabernacle of God praise the Lord so we are the Tabernacle of Christ so God got this Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit and he gives him over to us to sit in our souls and then he puts all things under his feet talk about our weaknesses praise the Lord talk about the hardships talk about the failures he gets all things and puts all of them under his feet praise the Lord and then he gives us control because he has control over all things and so the fullness of Christ is poured into the church which is his body to manifest him the fullness of Christ all that Christ was is given to you praise the lord it's given to the church it's given to indwell in our bodies to manifest him and then he takes this church this Tabernacle of mine this viers and takes control over it he's in control over everything he is in the body bringing it under subjection to his own leadership praise the Lord he was in the midst of the SP candlesticks and then he became part he became the church praise the Lord by getting this message and bring it to the church Through The Messengers and then Through The Messengers The Church receives him and when the church receives him the Bible says God gets the Christ and he pours it into the church to live in the church to control the church to guide the church to bring the church his own subjection to bring the church to the truth that's why the prophet says that time the church goes astray each time the church weakens God himself Jesus Christ praise the Lord he comes down and he takes over the church by way of The Messengers through the message and he rebukes it and he turns it back to the truth praise the Lord and that's how we are able to receive him because himself must come and take over the words praise the Lord and then he gives us his words he reveals himself to us and then he asks us to open the doors of our heart and open the door of our hearts he comes in and says when I come in I'll shut the door and no man will be able to open it when you receive the New Birth the H Spirit doesn't come to come and go but he comes to stay to teach us through all truth he comes to prepare us he comes to guide us to walk upon us until we are perfect to prepare us for the wedding supper Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us unto the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood our Redemption is is through the blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God that is Jesus Christ the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible or invisible we saw that last week him being the spoken words that in the beginning all things were created by Him Praise the Lord and the Bible says for by him all things were created that heaven and that are in Earth visible or invisible whether by the Thrones all dominions all principalities all powers all things were created by Him and for his purpose and now he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church praise the Lord when he comes when you receive him and he makes an AB in you he becomes the head of the church he becomes your head and all things get under his control who is the beginning and the first B from the de that in all things he made have the preeminence he's the head of this Tabernacle he's the head of your life he's the head of my life is the head of the bright praise the Lord that's why he brings all things under subjection and now when the bride recognizes that Christ lives on the Insight she has the potential to overcome all trials she has the ability all battles why Christ on the inside he has control over everything not some but everything for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross verse 20 having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him by him I say whether they be things in Earth or in he or things in heaven now and we that we are sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by Wicked works yet now has he reconciled through Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ that is the ministry of The Messengers to reconcile us to God reconcile us to Christ so each time we get AR brings his blood praise the Lord to reconcile us to himself in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight that is it that was the goal that is the goal death he took on the church he took on this body he took on your he may present himself in my place as holy without any blemish praise the Lord not just without blemish praise the Lord not just without blemish but unblamable that means when we in Christ when Christ is in us and we in him we cannot be blamed because before God We Are Holy praise the Lord and then he takes his glory and he gives it to us to bring us into Unity of the Spirit by word to bring us into the sub Obedience of the word in John 17:22 he says and the glory which th Gest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one same God same message through all ages the glory that you gave me I have given it unto them why I have glorified them I have presented them worthy without any blemish be blamed Christ coming down to be with us even in Us by the new birth praise the Lord the same that descended on the day of Pentecost the same is he that lives in the bride even today the same Christ that was in Peter the same Christ that was in Paul the same CH that was inanius in Martin Columbus and the rest of them inam is the same Christ that is in us today reconciling the church to himself the same God alha and omeg bringing the church back to God and Revelation 1 ver 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me say fear not I am the alha I am the I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and
