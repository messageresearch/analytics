If we can just recognize you believe we are not strangers. Praise the name. Okay. You're welcome. We're happy to have you today. Amen.

Yes, she's the one coming in. That's her husband. And where are the little children? Okay. They also getting in. So they've been with me over the weekend. [Music] Then I have my young brother Alex just stand up with your wife. Thank you so much. We had yesterday many visitors at our home and were all family members [Music] and we had over 50 people at home. So it was such a great time. So I have a testimony here from brother Wilfred. He says, "Dear brethren, I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It has been a tough situation for me and my family because on 31st last month. I was hospitalized when I was in a critical situation and the doctors stated that I'm suffering from liver disorder. But I'm glad I was discharged on Tuesday. We thank God for that. Praise the name of our Lord. Special thanks goes to our dear pastor and his family, sister and my family for the unwavering love, support and prayers. I also want to thank you brethren for each and every one of you who was able to visit us in hospital support us financially and also pray for us. Thank you so much. Please continue keeping us in prayers once again. Thank you so much. I'm forever grateful because this is not easy. May the almighty God bless you all your heart's desires each and every one of you. I really thank God for the recover of our brother. Amen. Sister, could you stand up when she was also admitted at she's here this morning. Thank you so much. We appreciate God for being with us this morning. Praise the name of our Lord. So our pastor is in Cavalary. He went to with Pastor George Franklin then that was on Monday. And I've been having meetings every day from 8:00 up to 10 in the night. Praise the name of our Lord. And there were so many ministers in those meetings. So you talk about having two services only. Those are having from eight up to 10. So if we have if we are spending here the whole day not even the whole day from 9 to 6 like today shouldn't be too much. Praise the name of so we just keep them in our prayers. They'll be traveling back tomorrow. Then there are also other meetings that are taking place. In Kala there are two conventions. I don't know why at the same time but there is a convention in and then in they've all been running I think from Thursday up to today again this week on Friday, Saturday and Sunday there are meetings in and our pastor will be preaching in those meetings. I would encourage you you can attend the meetings on Friday and Saturday that will be very good. Then there are also meetings in that's from Wednesday to Sunday. They will be having services from 9 to 100 p.m. That's for from Wednesday to Sunday. &gt;&gt; And then they'll be having a crusade from 3 p.m. to 700 p.m. I told the brother there maybe I'll be there on Thursday. because we also have other activities we engage ourselves in. We have our Wednesday service. We can't close the church. And then on the other days, Friday and Saturday, I wanted to be ina we are back here again. So today we have two services and the Lord's supper starting at 5:00 and then foot washing. Then next Sunday we're also going to have two services. We are going to have the morning service for all of us and then we are going to have the afternoon service for the youth who are in school. Praise the name of our Lord. But we may not refuse those who are who are out of school to attend that. But at the end of the month, we shall be having a youth meeting. But for those out of school and if you in school, we're not going to allow you in that meeting. Praise the name of just want to talk about mature things. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; So we are also not going to have our praying and fasting meetings on Saturday. Maybe shall love it after the coming weekend. The Lord being gracious. Praise the name of our Lord. Then after this service, I want the youth to remain just to talk with them for only 10 minutes before we go for lunch. Then we come back in the afternoon. So then I'll invite brother William and the team before. Amen. Amen. When sin came and could not worship without the blood, God came to fellowship with man. He found him not. He called Adam. Adam, where are you? I'm hidden. Could not bear God's presence without the blood. [Music] Eating from the tree of knowledge. Good and evil cause death. A state of nakedness. Man had fig leaves covered around them. A blood sacrifice of goats and skins. God meant to clothe them. Restoring life and fellowship with man again. Oh, the life for the life of the flesh is in the blood. And I have given it to you upon the altar. &gt;&gt; And it's the blood that makes atonement for my soul. and makes me fellowship with God once again. When Jesus gave up the cost at Calary, [Music] body sings suffering, his blood dripping down the altar, a perfect sacrifice, cleansing a sinner just like me, granting me access to fellowship. ship with God again for the life for the life of the flesh is in the blood. I have given me to you upon the altar. And &gt;&gt; it's the blood that makes atonement for my soul and makes me fellowship with God once again and fall I've sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and the wages of man sin we caused all death. But at the cross of Calvary, Jesus poured his blood for giving me a newness of life for the life. is for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given the need to you upon the altar. &gt;&gt; It's the blood &gt;&gt; It's the blood that makes atonement for my soul and makes me fellowship with God once again. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it's the blood that makes atonement for my soul and makes me fellowship with God again. Amen. It's the blood that makes atonement for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So today I took interest to minister on communion. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us stand up and have a word of prayer. Amen. Amen. Our father, we thank you again. We now commit the reading of the word into your hands. May the Holy Spirit come and minister to us according as we have needs. Speak to our hearts father. May we also receive from you Lord that father you may help us in our journey while we are still here on earth to be able to live a life that is acceptable before you bless us all together in the name of the Lord Jesus who grant us. Amen. Amen. Let us go to first Corinthians chapter 10 from verse 16 to verse 22. Verse 22. The Bible says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread and one body. For we are all partakers of that one bread. Behold, Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifice partake of the altar. What say I then that the idol is anything? All that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything. But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would note that you should have fellowship with devils. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils. You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the tables of the devil. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? May God of his word. So our subject is communion. Praise the name of our Lord. is a very wide thing to talk about communion. I don't know the Holy Spirit removed this morning, but I felt maybe since we're going to have communion in the night, it takes some kind of detailed study, but I don't know which direction. Praise the name of our Lord. Now communion is you know like when you look at that word communion in verse 16 it comes like from the word communicate you know so you communicate so there is a talking an exchange so there is a participation You know all of you praise the name of our Lord like husband and wife. They have to communicate. So they commune. They sit at the same table, eat the same food, share different kind of things and their union brings children. Commun. It is kind of like communion, you know, and kind of like interaction, depth interaction. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's the same thing also the Lord calls us to, you know, to have a communion with the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Just that kind of depth with the Lord. You know, you talk with him. He talks with you. Like for example in Genesis 18, the Lord visited Abraham and you know Abraham saw three men coming and then he ran to them and then he bowed down and said, "Oh Lord, you have found favor before you don't pass by me." Now you see that kind of relationship is calling him for communion you know it is hot you're going to sit down we going to make for you butter for you and of course when you have visitors you interact with them that was communion so the Lord came praise the name over and he communed with Abraham you know then he said where is your wife Sarah she's this way then after the Bible says the two angels went to Sodom but then Abraham he remained with God in Genesis chapter 18 and go to verse 33 praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:33, &gt;&gt; the scripture says, &gt;&gt; "And the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place." So the communion when the two angels had left and then God was telling Abraham, this is what is going to happen to Sodom. And then Abraham took interest. Lord, will you destroy the righteous with the unrighteous? So Abraham would ask God in verse 3023. And Abraham say near and said, "Will you also destroy the righteous with the unrighteous?" 50 righteous in the city. [Music] Will you also destroy and not spare the place for 50 righteous that are there in that be far from thee to do this after this manner? Let the righteous win the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from you. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right? And even us when we go to our in our prayers you know you start telling God troubles fear you know this thing is happening to me this thing has troubled me a lot I'm having a lot of you know talking but the challenge is we don't wait enough for him to talk back to us. Praise the name of our Lord. But God has ears to hear and he has the mouth to hear. But for you only want to use his ear, but you don't want to use his mouth. Assuming you know it's a relationship maybe husband and wife and the wife [Music] or the husband and then the other one is just seated there. Then you start wondering hey where is the communion here now? Oh, he's talking. You don't care what they talking. But then Abraham talked. Lord, you look at this kind of situation. Look at this kind of thing. You know, because God had come down and the Lord came down to where Abraham was. Abraham, you know, expressed his feelings to God. We have a personal relationship with God. We also express our feelings to God like anas a prophet when the Lord told him go to Saul and pray for himas told the Lord you don't know this man he has killed your disciples and he has authority to go everywhere Everybody is deadly. Lord, the Lord didn't keep quiet. The Lord talked back. I've chosen him as my vessel. Communion. Then when Anas went to the house of where Saul was, he called him brother Saul. Praise the name of communion. We should have a relationship with God. Don't look at God as judgmental God. Don't look at God as so wrathful. [Music] Look at him as your creator. If he created you, if he gives you what you have need of, why would you allow the devil to put a negative thought in your mind about God? And that's why the devil wants to take many of us. You know, you start cursing. You start saying, "Why did God make this?" But you are not seeing the goodness of God in what he's doing in your life. Then the Bible says we should give thanks at all times. Praise the name of our Lord. So now Abraham talked to God. And then the Lord talked back. And then the Lord said in verse 26, "And the Lord said, I find 50 souls in righteous in Sodom, I will spare the place for their sake. So God desires us to commune with him, to communicate exchange and this should not only be on Sunday as we are here you know like in the preaching of the word the lord is speaking to that's why when we come for the services a preacher has ministered let us have also time there's something the lord is speaking to you also need to speak back I've been doing a mistake Lord, I've been erroring with this. Forgive me for that. Give me the ability to overcome this weak point, to overcome this failure in my life. Speaking to him and the Lord would want to hear from you. What do you say about this? The Bible says, "Come, let us reason together." And brother Brandham preaches about a conference. is talking. There are decisions to make. Praise the name of our Lord. When the angels visited Lord and then they were telling Lord run to the mountain, Lord said oh no my Lord. Then they said okay you run to this place. There was a communion. You know there's a decision to make and that's the same thing we should do with our life. You don't on Sunday on Wednesday. Every day be in continuous communion with God. Communicate with God. Talk with God. Let him talk to you. Praise the name of our Lord. And when he talks to you, you know, obey what he's telling you. Follow what he's telling you. Praise the name of our Lord. There was a time, brother Brandham was in a hunting tree. And then now he told God, I will not kill animals for for just fun. Anyhow, like that. I will only shoot because I want to eat. And you know the Lord always desires to prove what we tell you. So now he was moving and then when they of course that was not immediately sometimes we say and we forget oh Lord this year I'm going to do this for you. [Music] Praise the name of our Lord. And the Lord waits on you today. I understood God knows the situation I'm going through. So, so brother Brham was moving and then there are animals that came moving in front of him. He had the gun. God wanted to prove it. You said you're not going to shoot anyhow. So when that went then the Lord reminded him that you've kept your promise. Praise the name of our Lord. Just like you have a friend I'm coming at this time and then you don't come. You know the Bible says if you put your confidence let me get the scripture &gt;&gt; because these are things we go through every other day. Praise the name of our Lord. If you put your confidence in untrusted man, you are like a joint out of order. When a snake is coming, you want to run. It is loose. You can't run away. Now that's we shouldn't be like that. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. In the book of Proverbs, &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 25 and verse 19, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Confidence in unfaithful man in the time of trouble. [Music] is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint. You you you want to eat meat. Let me say like this. You've reached and then you're salvating for that roasted chicken. You've you've already given them 6,000 they have given you. You try to put in the mouth but one tooth is broken. You want to eat but the tooth is not there. Then he says you are like a foot out of joint. You can't run when there is trouble and we shouldn't behave like that. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us be reliable when time for service has come. Let us be dependable. Praise the name of our Lord. Be reliable. Be somebody one can b on. Be somebody can lean on. And that's what communion should bring us to. Then you can know that what I'm saying is taking it serious. I'm not taking it lightly. I thought you were joking. That's a foot out of joint. Broken tooth. It can't serve its purpose. So now when we come for communion or when we are having communion, there is some form of confidence that is built. Praise the name of our Lord. Now let us go to first 2 Corinthians chapter 6. &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 14, &gt;&gt; be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion has light with darkness? 2 Corinthians chapter 6. So communion is the same word as fellowship. Then he says, "How can unbelievers have fellowship with believers?" Communion because everybody is participating. There's somebody everybody is bringing something there. Now this unbeliever is talking about things which are dirty. Then for you a believer, you are there also saying ah this one is my best friend. What fellowship do you have? What communion do you have? Then the Bible says how can light and darkness commune? How can darkness and light stay together? One has to give room for the other. And that's the same thing. If light comes, darkness will go away. If light lives, automatically it is dark. Same thing in our lives. What do we desire in our lives? what we put most of our time into. Praise the name of our Lord, what do you commune with? Then the Bible says, "What conquered has Christ with burial?" Verse 15, or what part has the believer with unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them. I will walk in them and I will be their God. I they shall be my people. Praise the name of communion. God would that communion with us where he can come and live with us, walk within us, express himself within us and it's to open it for him. Praise the name of our Lord because he desires. Praise the name of our Lord. He had fellowship with Adam and Eve at the cool of the day talking with them. Every day he would come. But now when sin came, it brought that separation. It distorted the communion. It distorted the fellowship until they were afraid to go into the presence of God. And whenever you are also afraid to go into the presence of God, it means your communion, there's something wrong with it. That means there are some evil spirits that are drawing you away that are taking you into a wrong place. So you need to make sure that your heart condition you can freely commune with the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Continuous fellowship. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in Exodus chapter 25 and then verse 22. Praise the name of the Lord. So the Lord was telling Moses about the seat. When at the on the top of the master seat there I will meet with you fellowship. There has to be a meeting. There has to be some kind of coming together. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he said, "And then I will commune with you from above the masses and from between the two cherab praise the name of our lord." So there has to be communion. He said, "I will come. I meet you." The way he met Abraham and then he talked with Abraham and then Abraham knew the mind of God. That should be our lives every other day. Praise the name of our Lord every day. You know you delight to commune with God. You to talk to God. You to hear what the Lord is telling. should be a life that we live not only on church on Sunday on Wednesday not only that but even at my place of work I should be in constant communion with the Lord when I'm talking to somebody and when I'm talking to them they look at somebody different when I say yes I mean Yes. But some of these places, places of work, he says yes, meaning no. He says this meaning I should not be like that. If I've been employed to be at the reception, let me do my job diligently. Receive the people with respect and then guide them properly. Don't just do everything diligently. And then people will have a testimony. Praise the name of our Lord. If maybe I'm a physician, you know, be diligent. Do the best you can. Praise the name of our Lord. Whatever work God has put us in, be faithful in that kind of work, praise the name of our Lord. So, we need to see that we do what is right before God. So God told Moses, I will meet with you and commune with you from above the mercy seat. Now this is very interesting. So communion he says I'll meet with you and then when I meet with you I will talk with you from where the masses sit. You should look what at as a privilege. I'm going to meet my maker. I'm going to meet my Lord. I want to talk to him. How how can I take long without praying? How can I take long without reading this? Praise the name of the Lord. Like if you really love somebody, your your mind is taken into him. You know your time is taken into him. You know, you just want to know more about one another. When you get a call, you know, you even start smiling, you know, because you just longing. That should be the same thing with the Lord. Not a burden. I don't again the whole day I have no time to wash my clothes have no time to visit. Now we have I mean we have football in the afternoon and I wanted to see that match. So you want to commune with football? You want to commune with different things but the privilege that Lord has given unto us that commune with me above the mercy seat. Praise the name of our Lord. And then when you do that, I will tell you what you need to do because the Lord knows the end from the beginning. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to see that communion is not a one time thing but something that we are in continuously praise the name of our God. I want to pick up this message. In the message communion, brother Brandham says, "And in other words, the father sent me and I live by him. And every man that comes to Christ must live by Christ. Oh my, there you are. That is the communion. That's the real communion that you find when you live by Christ. Now, our bodies need food and drink each day to survive. our physical body. If we don't take food each day and drink, then our body weakens. There is something in us that we must have food. One day's food will not last the next day. You've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal body. You can live over but you become weaker. And the second day still weaker. The third day you are getting tremendously weak. Then he says, &gt;&gt; "Well, that's what many times we do in the spiritual realm." Just imagine how often you think about God. How often you think about the word of God? Praise the name of our God. only on Sunday then Monday you even don't know whether God is there. It's just not in your mind even in your language. Somebody calls you God bless you. How are you? Even responding God bless you too because you are surrounded with darkness. Maybe you in the market. You don't want them to know that you're Christian. God bless you. &gt;&gt; What do you commune with? &gt;&gt; You are afraid to confess him before men. Praise the Lord. Now people don't have hope. People who don't have hope, they are proud to show who they are. They are proud. Some of these people worship men and they put the men on their t-shirts on their even happy to tell you about them. [Music] But we will talk about the Lord. Praise the name of God. &gt;&gt; So you are afraid. &gt;&gt; How weak are you? You are afraid. Talk about God. You are afraid to show people you are carrying a Bible. Mine is on the phone. Or if you have one, you want to cover it and disguise it. You are afraid. You are afraid to walk with people who confess his name. You just don't want to identify yourself or when you are coming to church and you in a tax, you put me there to you put me in front. You don't want them to see that you are coming. You're afraid. How weak are you? Praise the name of But these are demons that told us. So you are afraid. I'm going to church. You know, you tell them. Praise the name of I'm born again. Don't be shy about that. But now you are weak even to confess as if they are stifling your throat. No, you are weak. So if you are weak, you need to eat. So what do you eat? The word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Read the word. hear the word, pray about it, and then God will give you the strength. Praise the name of our Lord. So, Brother Brandham says here, you see, each day, we've got to commune with Christ. We've got to talk him to to him each day. We've got to settle it with him each day. Paul said I die each day. See, each day I die yet I live. &gt;&gt; Not me, &gt;&gt; but Christ lives in me. Now if you die, you need another to live in you and that is Christ. So I've died to my thoughts, to my evil friends. to bad places. If there was a seat at a joint for you, they said that one you died. So you don't exist there, but there is somewhere where you are alive. Praise the name of somewhere where you are alive. When brother Brham was talking to some of his friends and then he said for you don't like smoking you don't like drinking you don't like going for night what do you like said I like being in church for praise the name of our lord it's something which should have a passion in your life you know I like taking my time when I get my phone I'm I'm not on naked women. No, I'm on the things that build me spiritually. I'm not on secular music. When you put on those earphones, then you are just on secular music. Oh, praise the name of I'm just hearing the word. I put them on. I'm I'm I'm kind of hearing again the sermon we had yesterday. I'm hearing the things of the Lord. I'm hearing the prophet speak to me. There is something that keeps on building in you. So he says we need to commune with Christ. So your physical body needs food for each day and drink each day to survive. your spiritual body. You need spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive. Praise the name of our Lord. I just love that. I wish we can live like that tomorrow. I'm just feeding on the Lord. I'm communing with the Lord. I'm praying with the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Tuesday, I'm doing the same. Unless I'm doing the same in the afternoon on Wednesday, my mind is tuned to church. Then I just come to church. Praise the name of our Lord. I want to get a refilling. Praise the name of our Lord. I go back and you know when the troubles come, you have faith to pray. Say, Lord, this is the trouble. Then you believe you see the Lord move. But now if you are afraid to even confess God and then trouble come in the evening, you'll be like the other people without Christ. [Music] You are crying like those without. If you have God, the Lord intervene in this kind of you commune with him. You can say okay in my night praying and intercession. I'm going to bring this before the Lord. Lord, there is this issue. Lord, may you intervene. Lord, may you guide. You are communing. So you're not there waiting. I don't know when Wednesday will come. I don't know when Sunday will come. But right there, that same day, you present your petition before the Lord because you commune with him. Praise the name of our Lord. Like, brother Brandham gives a testimony about that woman who prayed until the plane was stopped. She had a son and the son had gone into immoral living but she loved God and you know she started you know her life she was always communing with God said you're the one who gave me this son now I'm trying to show him the he rebellious until he get himself into social acts and then he does things which are bad until he got some venerial disease and it was killing him and then she kept on pleading. You had a a widow woman like me a prophet Lord where is my prophet Elijah you can send that you know she was communing so she was able to know the right word to apply in a particular stra of lord you must know the right word what you know appears like mine in the bible Why has God, you know, allowed this to happen? Why does the Lord want me to do this kind of stuff? So, she kept on communing with the Lord until she dreamt in the night. And a voice told her, go and stand at the door outside your gate. I'm sending my prophet is dressed like this. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Allah. She knew how to commune and the Lord was there to answer her back. She speaks. The Lord speaks. She speaks. The Lord speaks. That should be our life every other day. In continuous communion, praise the name of our Lord. You commune with God. But say Lord there is this issue like Rebecca when the children were fighting in her womb she communed with God. Say Lord why is this happening to me? Then the Lord talked back that one there are two nations in your way. The younger shall fight the elder and will do better than the elder. you know knowing from the Lord. So we need to be in continuous communion. Praise the name of our Lord. So now brother Brennham he said let me go and post my mail and because he saw the time is there and then when he went to post the mail in post office the voice told him walk. He said okay. He started walking turn this way and he was walking this way this way. So he was passing by and the woman told him said hey how did you know me? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of he said I saw you. Now you can imagine God didn't reveal to the prophet but revealed to the woman her prayers her communion with God brought the prophet of God to her home. Praise the name of our Lord. And brother Brandham, when he entered the home, then she told the prophet, you know, I'm like this woman in the Bible. I pray to God. You told me you are coming and did you come and I have my child to pray for then told her you pray. And he said, if there is somebody who knows how to talk to God, the other woman knew the God she was talking. No, she knew who she was talking. That's a personal relationship. That's how we should have with God. Praise the name of our Lord. That's how we should have with God. When church delays when you're when you're meeting an important person say ah today we have even more time you know he talked I talked he talked I talked he talked I talked praise the name of the Lord That's communion. But if it is only one hour, one one minute prayer. You are afraid of the night. [Music] I don't know what is going to happen. &gt;&gt; Then you are yawning. Sleep is disturbing you. Amen. Amen. What kind of communion is that? It's just like you go to somebody in their office. He's seated there. He's talking with you. Uhhuh. How do you commune? Just like sometimes at home the wife is talking, the husband is in his newspapers. What are you saying? What kind of communion? So you need to go with all your mind time is given to and then you able to hear what he tells. Praise the name of our Lord. That kind of communion. Praise the name of our Lord. And then he says we need &gt;&gt; to commune with the Lord each day to survive. Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth. So each day we've got to study the Bible. Each day, praise the name of you know my phone. So you let me read only one verse. Amen. Is that what just reviewing flash? You know take time study &gt;&gt; and to study means even doing cross reference. Yeah. Jesus said about this. The other day we were being told about this. Yeah. this. Now if Paul says like this where is it in the Old Testament go back and try to find there you are studying praise the name of you are taking time into it. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he said some people doesn't study it at all. Some pick it up every two or three times a year. But a real believer that is spiritually built up, he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord. That is right. He has to. Man shall not live by bread, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth. In other words, the father sent me and I live by him. And every man that comes to Christ must live by Christ. That's very interesting. You come to Christ. Why don't you live by Christ? And then he says, if you do that, there you are. That is the communion. You are living by Christ. That's the real communion that you find when you live by Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the same message. I'm not anywhere. Paragraph. Praise the name of our Lord. He said that's what it is. Okay. Then he says, "Now our bodies need food and drink it today. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to live by Christ. Every day I live by Christ." And that's what God was telling Moses. There I will meet you on top of the masses seat and I will commune with you. Praise the name of God. true communion, not false communion, not communion with devils, but communion based on the word of God. Praise the name of our Lord. A communion, fellowship, you know, something that you are into it, you've got yourself into it. Like the Bible says here in 2 Corinthians and then verse 13, chapter 13 and verse 14, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all." Amen. He says the grace of the Lord, the grace of God has brought salvation to us. And when salvation comes to us, it brings that love of God. And the love of God like husband and wife. When the man loves the wife, what comes next? Communion. Praise the name of our Lord. Communion. The man showed the grace picked the wife. Like when you marry, you've taken somebody's daughter. The leadership has been taken from the father to the husband. As a husband, you have to show that you love your wife even more than the parents. Praise the name of Yeah, you have to do that. You love her. You cherish her. Praise the name of our silus is in the class. You know, you just cherish her the way you cherish your body. The way you don't make your body go hungry. You see that you you bring you because you she had favor before you [Music] then you loved her. Now it is communion. But now some people they tend to be loving outside here. But when you go into their house, no communion, no communion, there's somebody got a wife. Then the best place to put the wife and let me put my wife in the village to cultivate the land. That was not the purpose of marriage. He said Adam was lonely. How how can you solve loness by one being in kal and another being in how no communion that should not be our lives. Praise the name of our lord. So now the Bible is telling us the grace of our Lord Jesus and that grace of God that God has shown to us, it puts the love of God, God himself in you. And when you have true love of God, always be in communion with the Holy Spirit. That should be our desire. Lord, I want to be in continuous communion with the Holy Spirit. The Bible says in Romans chapter 8 that as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the children of God. So you are you have died to yourself. The Holy Ghost has taken over your life. Until you are always depending on God, you rise up. Lord, I'm here. Lead me, Lord. Guide me, Lord. Direct me, Lord. You are completely depending upon God, the communion of the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of that kind of intimacy, praise the name of the communion of the Holy Spirit. So, the Bible says, Our human spirit together with the Holy Spirit have a testimony that we are the sons of God. We are the children of God. Praise the name of our Lord. That's the communion of the Holy Spirit. Your whole life given it over to God. That's the communion. So the word of God is not far from you. The presence of God is not far from you, but the Lord is always with you because you are communing. In the Old Testament, the master seat was a place. But now in the New Testament, when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, your heart becomes the master seat. So he wants to commune with you continuously right from inside within you talking with you communing with you even at your place of work communing with you even in your garden he's communing with you even you know in your businesses he's communing with you even in class he's communing with you praise the name of the Lord the communion of the Holy Spirit and the communion of the Holy Spirit. You avoid things that grieve the Holy Spirit. What are the things that can affect our communion with the Holy Spirit? Let us go to Ephesians 4. And then verse 30, praise the name of our Lord. Ephesians 4:30. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, Let us start from verse 29. Okay, we can pick it from behind here. Let us start from verse 24. He says, "And that you put on the new man new man, new creation. Now, when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal savior, why would you stop along the way? Why don't you desire? Lord, make me new. Lord, fill me with your Holy Lord. Live in my life. That's communion. You you allow him to make you new, &gt;&gt; which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. So the new man the Bible says you know is after God righteousness and holiness. So your mind is always about righteousness about holiness of God. Even your speech, you no longer have dirty words coming. You don't rejoice in being in those that place. You know, you want things that are glorifying to that, you know, establish you before the Lord, praise the name of Lord. Then he said, wherefore putting away lying. So if you know you lie say Lord I no longer want to lie but the whole day there is a lie you've told if you don't lie you can't survive. No that's in the darkness now but in the light but we're lying now you start preparing statements when you're going to meet somebody. If he says like this, if he says this, I would do this. Where is the new man now? &gt;&gt; In you said, put away lying. Then he says, speak every man truth with his neighbor, [Music] for we are members one of another. Be ye angry and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath. Praise the name of our Lord. So he says when you are angry don't do evil slap. Ghana, &gt;&gt; then you know that the anger has gone beyond now. And then he says when the sun is going down that anger should be away from you but now yesterday you are angry then even today you are holding anger something in you. No is the new man. What communion is that? Be angry, but don't let the sun go over your anger. Praise the name of our Lord. Communion. So you shouldn't allow anger be there. The thing was done last year, but you are still hurt and you feel that person there. from that day. I'm so angry with you. &gt;&gt; Did you die to yourself? Did you resurrect that which died away from you praise the name of our Lord? He said, "Don't sin." [Music] Then the Bible says neither give place to the devil let him that stall still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may be able to give him that needeth. Praise the name of Lord. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, [Music] &gt;&gt; but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers. Then verse 30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption. So you have the Holy Spirit in you and brings communion. Then he says don't grieve that Holy Spirit. How do you grieve the Holy Spirit? By doing things contrary to the word of God, you are grieving the Holy Spirit. And when you grieve the Holy Spirit, you are affecting your communion. You are affecting your communion. And so you'll find yourself a lot burdened, weak spiritually, even coming to church. It's a trouble coming to church. You have many excuses. You'll always have a reason of not coming to church. You'll always have a reason of not reading your Bible. You'll always have a reason, of not praying. Why? Because you have grieved the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not there. And yet in our Christian life, we need the Holy Spirit all the time in our life. Because the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is our earnest down payment. It's what proves that you are really born again. It's what proves that you are really a new man. It's what proves that you're not of the world. That's the Holy Spirit. Now, if you don't have the Holy Spirit, how are you going to be a Christian? You can't. You need the Holy Spirit in your life to give you the strength to give you the power to live the life of Christ. To overcome these demons, you need the Holy Spirit without the Holy Spirit. You can't go farther. How do you overcome your weaknesses? Or when you fall, how do you rise up without the Holy Spirit? When the Bible says that the Holy Spirit helps our infirmities but you know the one who supports you are decompaining him you have grieved him then what happens like sometimes when you are in the neighborhood you don't have money there is a shop you go to buy things from you don't have money and you know that's where you need to pick things up but all night talking but you don't have food at home you don't have money that's the only but that's what we do you You need the Holy Spirit to help you in your weaknesses but the one you areing putting off but he needs help in your weakness. He needs help in your prayers. The Bible says women don't know how to pray but the Holy Spirit in us seed because he knows the mind of God. that you have grieved the Holy Spirit. No more communion now because he's not there. He's grieved is grief. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says, "Let us not grieve the Holy Spirit." How do you grieve the Holy Spirit? Verse 31, let all of bitterness, not some, bitterness. Let that root be go away from us. Wrath, anger, clamor, &gt;&gt; and you see these spirits, if they come to your home, if you get a visitor, they just want to leave immediately, you get trouble because those are the spirits hanging around. There is this chair has a spirit of anger. This one has a spirit of bitterness. &gt;&gt; Every chair has a spirit. &gt;&gt; And then you sit in one of those chairs. There are some of those homes like that. When is the day going to end? Take away these spirits away from your home. Somebody is talking to their child but they are shouting &gt;&gt; clammer. The child is there before you. Some of these are our homes. Demons have taken over. There is no communion of the Holy Spirit because you already grieve the Holy Spirit. Rush. The child has made a smaller mistake. But even start shaking the body. No communion of the Holy Spirit. Bitterness alone. hotter than you know there are some people when they are made the eyes are red they say is not attractive at all you can't have communion of the holy spirit in that then the bible says evil speaking The other one can bring a word that I'm small but the words that proceed out of me. &gt;&gt; The Bible say that tongue is but can be too long. You know there are example when they are quarreling even when they are leaving they are quarreling. No communion there. Those are demons. So you cannot have fellowship with the Holy Spir but imagine living in that house demons there demons can come by one person. And now when you start also fellowshipping or communing with that person you despising and then you see all the kids have taken the same and now these are challenges for people who don't keep their children. You get this made from there She may be maybe maybe the the root of bitterness. She come with the demon. The other one evil speaking. They know every funny thing there is your children will learn from them. And you don't have time to fellowship with your children. You don't know where the danger is coming. This one has come with this demon. Next month another one comes with another demon and those demons keep there. You don't pray, you don't read the word, you don't take time to fellowship, they always there, no communion. Then the Bible says and marries. How you look at all these demons, evil speaking, bitterness, malice. They don't end there. One demon can bring this, the other one can bring this. But the Bible says, "Be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you." &gt;&gt; Now, praise the name of our Lord. Most of the things we shall do, we shall talk about them in the afternoon about the Lord's table. It's difficult to get into that line. But let us talk about our dayto-day living communion. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, there is a problem. If you don't want to forgive, he said forgiving one another. If you don't forgive, even the Lord will not hear your prayers. That's what the Bible says. Let us go to Markapter 11. Praise the name of our Lord. Mark chapter 11. And then we read in verse verse 25. And when you stand praying, forgive. If you have ought against any, that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. So if you don't forgive, you are not also forgiven. That's the scripture. So if you don't forgive, you grieve the Holy Spirit. So you cannot have communion with the Holy Spirit. So the Bible says in verse 26, &gt;&gt; if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. Praise the name of our Lord. So we need to forgive. If you don't forgive, &gt;&gt; you're also not forgiven. &gt;&gt; And if you don't forgive, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; you are subjected to tormentors and tormentors are demons. Actually, when you don't forgive, you under torment. you're the one under torment. You don't forgive you are under torment. &gt;&gt; So if you want to be healed from that forgive and those demons torment all the time that thing is aching you and some of these things can bring diseases. You want to go to the grave without forgiving. So we need to see that we avoid all those kind of areas. Praise the name of our lord. Now briefly let us introduce in the message communion. Brother Brandham says, "Now I do believe that communion, what we call communion, &gt;&gt; is the Lord's supper. Now we have only three physical divine orders left to us. One of them is communion, foot washing, water baptism. That's the only three things that he has told us to do. There's foot washing which we want to do this after this evening and then the Lord is tell. And then because there are three things you do physically. The first is water baptism. You sure love to go into the water. You be baptized in the name of Jesus. And now that baptism, you only do it once. If it is true, but now when it comes to communion, the Lord is stable. The Bible says as often as you would and foot washing as often as you would. Now in the brand tabernacle they were doing it once every month at the beginning of every month like the first Sunday of the month they would do it and we are trying so to do the same thing. Every person of the month in the evening, we do the best we can to observe. Now, these are commandments of God. Praise the name of our Lord. These are commandments of God. In the early church, they observed them. Now, you see that in the denominations, they don't care for them. They can do it anyway. The Lord's supper they take it as breakfast but it's a supper. So for them even at 8 in the morning but it was not a morning. And then in some denominations they get sodas cocoa then they go and buy tip top or some scones and they said now they on the lord's table no there is way we have to observe it is supper so time what did they use. Praise the name of our Lord. They used unleavened bread. So you don't put anything there other than mixing the flour with water. Praise the name of our Lord. And then Christ told us, &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord, &gt;&gt; that you take the wine and that wine represented his blood. Praise the name of our Lord. Now, communion, &gt;&gt; you will see that it's meedcri is the one who started it when he met Abraham. He gave him wine. Praise the name of our Lord. In Genesis 14 and verse 17, &gt;&gt; Genesis Genesis 14:17, &gt;&gt; it says, "And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after the return from the slaughter of the children and of the kings that were with him at the V of Shab, which is the king is there. And the king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, and was the priest of the most high God. He brought bread unleavened bread and wine. He was the priest of the high priest. He served Abraham. Praise the name of our Lord. He started communion. And we see that the same when he put on flesh, he also introduced the same. Now, &gt;&gt; so we see when we we shall look that in the afternoon that in Exodus 12, God told them about the Passover. And then he told them, you get a lamb without blemish. Praise the name of our Lord. And then you put that lamb, you sacrifice it on the 14th day. And then you get the blood. And then you put it on the door. And when the angel is passing there, he says, I will pass over that house where the dopost has been p where the blood has been pou. Praise the name of our Lord. Now from that day, the Lord told them this. You shall do it as a memorial. So now they would roast the meat and then eat that meat. So they were killing their Passover. It was an animal. So now they did it through all the generations until when Christ came. Praise the name of our Lord on that night. Praise the name of our Lord because they were having it was always called a feast of unleaven bread. So they would eat the unleaven bread with the roasted meat, but they wouldn't apply the blood on their doorsteps. But the life of the flesh is in the blood. So for them when they were doing this thing, they were looking at a sacrifice that is to come. And then he has Christ stands in the junction. Praise the name of our Lord.Ced wine and and even bread. Then Moses brings them the Passover that you know he's going to pass over you. So you are secure. You're not going to die. Now when Christ stands here, he introduces and he tells them instead of roasting animals, praise the name of our Lord because the blood was in the animal. And he says now this is my blood. Praise the name of our Lord. The blood of the new testament. So when Christ comes, he takes them back to me, the wine and unleavened bread. So they stopped killing animals for the Passover. Praise the name of our Lord. Then he says, "This bread is my body. This wine is my blood. He's identifying with what MeredC did in Genesis chapter 14 and saying this is my fulfillment of it. He says when you take this blood this is the blood of the new testament. Praise the name over. It's the blood of the New Testament. During the Passover, they were only killing the animals. Praise the name of our Lord. But when Christ comes, no more animal killings. Because he's the Passover lamb. He has that animal they were killing every year. He said, "I'm the one now." But to stand for my blood, there is wine here. Praise the name of our Lord representing the life of Jesus Christ. Then the bread representing the body which is the word of God. So it is important for us to be part of the Lord's table. Praise the name of our Lord and you need to be part of it. If you are also in communion with God, you don't only do it on Sunday. You are living a clean life. Praise the name of our Lord. You know there are people who have excuses. When the Lord's supper comes, they are busy doing something else. I present themselves, have a program. Why don't you live right before God? Praise the name of our Lord. Why don't you live right before God? &gt;&gt; But then you are dodging. When this time comes, that's the time to escape. That's the time to dodge. It is very important. You know Jesus told Peter, if I don't wash your feet, you are not part of me. Praise the name of the Lord. So as God gives us opportunity, we need to observe the Lord's supper. See that you are part of it. Brother Brandham was saying when they took that Passover in Exodus 12 for 40 years, none of them was sick. And said even the Lord's supper, you can come when you are sick and partake of it and you are healed, you are delivered. Praise the name of the Lord. And then for you don't want that. Satan keeps you there tormenting you, tormenting you, tormenting you. Now, if the rapture happens today, when will you be ready? Praise the name of our Lord. But we need to live in continuous communion. Praise the name of our Lord. I believe we shall continue from there in the afternoon. May God bless you. Amen. Let us sing song 140. Redeemed, redeemed, th I love to proclaim it. After prayers, I want the youth to remain. And then we talk them for 10 minutes only. Praise the name of our Lord. Redeem thou I love to proclaim me.

Oh, and the joy we share as we carry there none other has ever known. Yes, he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own. [Music] And the joy we share as we tear them. None another has ever known.
