[22:36] were fellowshipping here with us
[22:41] praise the name of our Lord we want to
[22:45] appreciate the Sunday School by Brother
[22:46] Wilson
[22:49] where is the name of Allah I remember
[22:52] last time we had started
[22:55] itself but then because he was having
[22:58] engagements on Sunday
[23:00] I was not able to continue with it
[23:03] and I believe now that is done with
[23:05] school then the kids and Kama is a
[23:07] voxoma he'll be able to continue with it
[23:09] every Sunday
[23:12] yeah
[23:15] praise the name of our Lord our pastor
[23:18] is not around today
[23:20] he went for missionary work overseas
[23:24] keep him in your prayers
[23:29] then also want to remind us
[23:33] that today we have a youth meeting in
[23:36] this afternoon service
[23:40] after lunch
[23:42] they used to keep around
[23:45] for the afternoon service
[23:48] then on Friday
[23:50] that will be 24th of March
[23:53] we are going to have an overnight
[23:55] service here without one

[24:17] for married people I always
[24:19] praise the name of our Lord so I would
[24:22] encourage all the married people to
[24:24] attend
[24:26] I remember when we didn't have these
[24:28] meetings
[24:29] you know people are raising we need to
[24:32] have married people's meetings
[24:36] now when we started the married post
[24:38] meeting
[24:40] there are some married people who are
[24:42] habitually okay I present themselves
[24:47] and then you start wondering
[24:51] praise the name of our Lord let us not
[24:54] be like children in the marketplace
[24:59] when they got their friends
[25:14] is too much
[25:17] we started whipping when they started
[25:19] whipping
[25:20] they didn't do anything
[25:24] so when God gives us an opportunity for
[25:27] anything
[25:29] it's always good for us to receive it
[25:32] praise the name of Allah it's for our
[25:35] goodness
[25:38] destruction may not be the best in your
[25:40] family
[25:42] but what is spoken in those meetings can
[25:45] give Grace

[36:58] for the great salvation
[37:02] a free gift Lord
[37:05] not that we deserved it
[37:07] by grace that we are served
[37:11] we are so thankful foreign
[38:29] you've been watching over
[39:15] and the Lord spoken to Moses and Aaron
[39:18] in the land of Egypt saying
[39:24] this month shall be until the beginning
[39:27] of months it shall be the first of the
[39:30] year to you
[39:35] [Music]
[39:38] speaking all day speak ye unto all the
[39:41] congregation of Israel saying in the
[39:44] tenth day of this month they shall take
[39:46] to them every money lamp according to
[39:49] the house of their fathers and a lamp
[39:52] for an house
[39:53] number
[40:09] and if the household be too little for
[40:12] the lamb let him and his neighbor next
[40:15] unto his house take it according to the
[40:18] number of the souls every man according
[40:20] to his eating shall make your count for
[40:23] the
[40:29] lamps
[40:45] your lamb shall be without blemish a man
[40:49] of the first year you shall take it out
[40:52] from the ship or from the gods
[40:56] foreign
[41:07] and you shall keep it until the 14th day
[41:10] of the same month and the whole assembly
[41:12] of the congregation of Israel shall kill
[41:15] it in the evening and they shall take
[41:17] off the blood and strike it on the two
[41:20] side posts and on the upper door post of
[41:23] the houses
[41:24] wherein they shall eat it
[41:46] and they shall eat the Flesh in the dark
[41:49] night roast with fire and unleavened
[41:53] bread and with bitter herbs they shall
[41:55] eat it
[42:06] it not of vitro nor a sudden all with
[42:11] water but lost with fire his head with
[42:15] his legs and with the partners they are
[42:18] on them
[42:28] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[42:32] until morning and that which remaineth
[42:35] of it until the morning you shall burn
[42:37] with fire now
[42:46] and that shall you eat it with your
[42:49] loins guarded your shoes on your feet
[42:52] and your stuff in your hand and you
[42:54] shall eat it in haste it is the Lord
[42:56] this Passover
[43:12] for I will pass through the land of
[43:15] Egypt this night and I'll Smite all the
[43:17] first born in the land of Egypt both man
[43:20] and Beast and against all the gods of
[43:23] Egypt will I execute judgment I am the
[43:26] Lord and the Lord and the blood shall be
[43:28] for a token upon the houses where you
[43:32] are when I pass when I see the blood I
[43:35] will pass over you and the plague shall
[43:37] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[43:40] smite the land of Egypt is
[43:57] [Music]
[44:50] so here God was
[44:54] taking the children of
[44:57] Israeli from the land of Egypt
[45:01] to the land of promise
[45:05] praise the name of Allah and then here
[45:08] what the scripture tells us to cover he
[45:11] told them to take a lamb
[45:14] for a house
[45:16] or if there are few they can combine
[45:19] themselves
[45:21] and then he says when you take this lamp
[45:26] it should be blameless
[45:31] so then he says
[45:35] and then you keep it
[45:38] praise the name of Allah in Exodus
[45:41] chapter 12.
[45:43] and then verse 3. he's saying speaking
[45:47] unto all the children Congregation of
[45:49] the children of Israel
[45:52] saying that in the 10th day of this
[45:55] month
[45:56] they shall take unto them every man
[45:59] alone
[46:02] and then the condition of the Lamb that
[46:05] was to be blameless
[46:08] they were meant to keep that lamp up to
[46:11] the 14th
[46:17] and you shall keep until the 14th day of
[46:20] December
[46:23] and the whole assembly of the
[46:25] congression of Israel shall kill it in
[46:28] the evening
[46:33] so then you see that the conditions
[46:38] the condition of being blameless
[46:42] was on the lamb
[46:44] was on the sacrifice
[46:47] praise the name of our Lord and then he
[46:50] had the Bible tells us in Psalms chapter
[46:54] 51.
[46:56] that we were born in sin and shaped in
[47:00] iniquity
[47:02] and then Romans chapter 3 and then in
[47:06] verse 23
[47:07] praise the name of Allah you know for
[47:10] all have sinned
[47:12] and become short of the glory of God
[47:16] so now what God requires of us
[47:20] is to take the perfect lamb
[47:24] and when we take the perfect life then
[47:28] we also become perfect
[47:34] was not on the people equivalent to
[47:38] rather the blamelessness
[47:40] was required on the land
[47:43] was required on the sacrifice
[47:47] praise the name of Allah so we see that
[47:49] our Lord Jesus Christ is
[47:54] the name of our Lord and we see our Lord
[47:57] Jesus Christ
[48:01] was also put among the whole of critics
[48:05] you know to check him in everything
[48:09] he went and appeared before the high
[48:11] priest
[49:00] [Music]
[49:10] but then we should not look about the
[49:13] Old Testament of the false Witnesses
[49:16] and our false Witnesses
[49:23] and Satan will always be there until
[49:27] he's Bound for a thousand years
[49:30] but we shouldn't look at the testimony
[49:32] of the false Witnesses
[49:37] we should look at the testimony of Jesus
[49:40] Christ
[49:43] now I want us to go to some chats here
[49:49] on slide 13 if we can put it there
[49:54] just talk about the lamb and applying
[49:57] the blood no questions
[50:05] there are some church which you want us
[50:07] to look for pictorial what do I need for
[50:09] an event
[50:10] you know where you know they were
[50:13] slaying the lamps
[50:15] and then they had to draw the blood can
[50:19] make it
[50:20] now you see here
[50:24] they were actually you know slaughtering
[50:26] or cutting cutting drawing cutting the
[50:29] neck of the lamp burning outside
[50:32] and then they were drawing this blood is
[50:37] now when this was done in the evening
[50:41] now when they got this Blood
[50:44] the scripture says they had to apply it
[50:48] on the door on the two sides of the door
[50:53] that's this sideaku
[50:59] they had to apply it on this idea
[51:02] and then this idea and then the upper
[51:06] here
[51:07] covering with the blood
[51:11] we got the next one
[51:14] you see that the blood was on the top
[51:16] post
[51:18] and then on the post on the side
[51:22] that's what they were doing
[51:24] praise the name that's what they were
[51:28] doing that was in the Old Testament
[51:31] thank you but then you see that in the
[51:35] Old Testaments
[51:38] they were using animal blood
[51:42] and now the Animal blood
[51:46] animal life
[51:49] praise the name of Allah and the animal
[51:52] life
[51:53] could not come back to the worshipers
[52:00] now in the message
[52:04] the prophet says
[52:06] and this is the evening time of the age
[52:09] that we live in
[52:13] this is the evening time for the church
[52:18] that is slide number four
[52:21] this is the evening time for me
[52:25] this is the evening time for my message
[52:30] I'm dying
[52:32] I'm going ninja I'm moving out
[52:36] in the evening time of the gospel
[52:41] and we've come up through justification
[52:46] and so forth but this is the time that
[52:50] the token has to be applied
[52:54] I told you last Sunday
[52:57] I had something I want to talk to you
[53:00] about
[53:02] this is it you know
[53:05] the time that when you just can't play
[53:08] with it
[53:10] so the prophet is telling us they were
[53:13] those children of Israel the way they
[53:17] were in Egypt death was roaming to come
[53:20] over the land
[53:22] so there was nothing like playing games
[53:31] and it is also the same thing to us
[53:34] now for us the blood is not applied on
[53:38] the door
[53:39] but the blood has to be applied to our
[53:42] house
[53:44] to be applied to ourselves
[53:50] then he says
[53:52] if it is ever going to be done
[53:55] it is going to be done now
[53:59] because we can see that the Wrath is
[54:02] about ready to pass through them
[54:05] and everything from under the token will
[54:09] perish
[54:13] has identifies you know
[54:16] for the animal alive would not come back
[54:21] on the human beings
[54:23] when the blood was shared the life went
[54:27] out
[54:28] because it was a unit
[54:33] and when life's blood was gone from it
[54:39] the life being different from the blood
[54:43] the blood is the chemistry of the life
[54:48] but the life is something different
[55:45] could not come back upon a human life
[55:49] because it didn't have a soul
[56:03] the soul is the nature of the life
[56:07] therefore it had no certain nature
[56:11] it was an animal
[56:13] therefore the blood stood for a token
[56:17] that the life had been given to everyone
[56:21] but in this glorious place
[56:27] there is a difference between the blood
[56:30] and the life
[56:32] they're talking
[56:34] foreign
[57:12] slide 15. okay combinator praise the
[57:15] name of our Lord
[57:17] and you know in that slide right
[57:22] they put the blood on the door
[57:26] praise the name of Allah but now we need
[57:29] to get the blood
[57:31] let us go the last slide
[57:39] now we see our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:42] too when he was on the cross
[57:46] he shed his blood
[57:48] praise the name of Allah he shared this
[57:51] black
[57:52] and when he shared his blacks his life
[57:56] went out of him
[57:59] praise the name of Allah his life went
[58:02] out of him
[58:04] now let us go to John chapter seven
[58:09] praise the name of our Lord
[58:11] John Chapter 7
[58:16] and then we read in verse 37 to verse 39
[58:18] so much
[58:22] in the last day that great day of the
[58:25] fifth Jesus stood and cried saying if
[58:28] any man says let him come unto me and
[58:31] drink he that believeth on me as the
[58:35] scripture has said out of his Berry
[58:37] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[58:44] yes
[58:59] praise the name of our Lord so he was
[59:02] saying if you are thirsty
[59:08] and I believe we are all fasted this
[59:11] morning
[59:15] praise the name of our Lord and then
[59:17] we've come to drink from the Fountain of
[59:19] Living Waters
[59:23] and this Fountain is
[1:00:09] rivers of Faith rivers of goodness
[1:00:12] all coming out of you
[1:00:17] because you have been connected to the
[1:00:19] living fountains
[1:00:21] I've also become a fountain and then the
[1:00:25] river foreign
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:01:47] but this is spunk of the spirit
[1:01:51] Mario which they that believe on him
[1:01:54] should receive but the Holy Ghost was
[1:01:58] not yet given
[1:01:59] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:02:04] now so you see here the Bible says that
[1:02:09] down Holy Spirit
[1:02:10] was not yet given because the Lord Jesus
[1:02:21] and Resurrection in other words he had
[1:02:25] not shared his blood
[1:02:27] and now when he shared
[1:02:30] then the life that was in the blood
[1:02:34] came back on the day of pension
[1:02:40] when Jesus died on the cross
[1:02:43] he released his life
[1:02:46] and the life of Jesus Christ is the Holy
[1:02:50] Spirit
[1:03:04] glory be to God foreign
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:40] [Music]
[1:03:51] let us go to Romans chapter 3.
[1:03:54] praise the name of our lord they're
[1:03:56] talking today
[1:03:58] is the life of Jesus Christ so the
[1:04:01] question is do you have today's tokens
[1:04:06] do you have the life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:12] do you have the
[1:04:15] spirit of God you
[1:04:19] know
[1:04:20] praise the name of Allah so Romans
[1:04:23] chapter three
[1:04:26] and then verse 35.30
[1:04:32] later started from verse 23.
[1:04:35] 3
[1:04:36] 23.
[1:04:38] but all I've seen and come short of the
[1:04:42] glory of God
[1:04:43] foreign
[1:04:47] being justified freely by his grace
[1:04:50] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[1:04:52] Jesus whom God has set forth to be the
[1:04:56] appropriation through faith in his blood
[1:04:59] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:05:02] remission of sins that are passed
[1:05:04] through the forbearance of God
[1:05:09] is
[1:05:28] the name of our Lord so the Bible says
[1:05:31] for all I've seen
[1:05:34] that was the nature we had
[1:05:37] when we came here on Earth our first
[1:05:41] nature our nature from the first Adam
[1:05:45] was a sinful nature foreign
[1:06:36] foreign
[1:07:16] foreign
[1:07:57] he was offering for our sins
[1:08:01] now when we go back to Romans
[1:08:04] and then verse 25. the Bible says God
[1:08:10] that sent forth a propitiation
[1:08:13] through faith in his blood
[1:08:16] to declare his righteousness
[1:08:19] for the remission of sins
[1:08:24] through the forbearance of God
[1:08:29] when you accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:08:32] personal assistant
[1:08:34] you repent of your sins and when you
[1:08:37] repent of your sins the Bible says
[1:08:40] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:08:44] in the name
[1:09:40] your
[1:09:43] failures of everything foreign
[1:10:02] Hebrews 9 15.
[1:10:04] the Bible says
[1:10:07] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[1:10:11] the New Testament that by means of death
[1:10:14] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[1:10:16] that were under the first testament they
[1:10:19] which are called might receive the
[1:10:22] promise of Eternal inheritance
[1:10:43] so the Bible is telling us
[1:10:51] went and removed all the sins in the
[1:10:55] first testament
[1:10:58] and the first testament is the only
[1:11:02] instruments
[1:11:06] went and picked the sin of Adam and Eve
[1:11:09] in the garden
[1:11:12] and then it came forward
[1:11:15] and then it goes until
[1:12:17] we are talking about the blood of God
[1:12:19] foreign
[1:13:41] it is not complicated
[1:13:45] praise the name of Allah
[1:13:48] let us go to that chart which is in a
[1:13:50] table
[1:13:51] Katrina
[1:13:55] praise the name of our lord it's not
[1:13:57] complicated
[1:14:00] there is a chat in tabular form
[1:14:06] we want to refer to that and see you can
[1:14:09] imagine fighting
[1:14:11] also made
[1:14:18] so in this church
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:24] there is justification
[1:14:27] sanctification and then the baptism of
[1:14:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:14:36] I want to go to that chat please
[1:14:44] so there is justification
[1:14:47] sanctifications
[1:14:50] and now when you see all this
[1:14:52] sanctification
[1:14:57] Gamble
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:20] praise the name of Allah you'll see that
[1:15:23] to be Sanctified you needed the black
[1:15:26] which I go inside to be Sanctified you
[1:15:29] need the Holy Ghost to be Sanctified you
[1:15:33] need the word wait I'll get you gamble
[1:15:35] foreign
[1:16:47] Romans chapter 5 and verse
[1:16:50] it says therefore being justified by
[1:16:55] faith
[1:16:57] we have peace with God
[1:17:00] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:03] so you cannot have faith
[1:17:05] without them hearing the words so when
[1:17:09] you hear the words the word motivates
[1:17:12] your heart
[1:17:14] to have faith and then you say Lord I
[1:17:18] believe
[1:17:21] and then when you accept it
[1:17:24] you are Justified
[1:17:26] praise the name of Allah your sins are
[1:17:29] taken away
[1:17:32] so then you see that you need the word
[1:17:36] to be justified
[1:17:39] you can't be justified but yet at the
[1:17:43] same time
[1:17:44] as you receive the word
[1:17:47] the word praise the name of Allah let us
[1:17:51] go back to the church
[1:17:55] praise the name of Allah
[1:17:59] as you receive it
[1:18:02] it is the spirit of God
[1:18:05] that is
[1:18:11] praise the name of Allah it is the
[1:18:13] spirit of God that is
[1:18:19] so when the spirit convicts you in first
[1:18:23] Corinthians chapter
[1:18:25] this one here first Corinthians chapter
[1:18:27] 6 verse 11.
[1:18:31] praise the name of our Lord First
[1:18:33] Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 11.
[1:18:37] the Bible says
[1:18:39] and such were some of you being washed
[1:18:43] but you are Sanctified but you are
[1:18:46] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:49] Christ and by the spirit of Our Lord
[1:18:53] is
[1:19:07] so the Bible is telling us the spirit
[1:19:13] justifies us
[1:19:18] and so here you've heard the word Gamble
[1:19:22] and the word of God
[1:19:25] praise the name of Allah brother Branham
[1:19:28] tells us in the message
[1:19:32] let us go there
[1:19:35] praise the name of our Lord
[1:19:38] in the message talking
[1:19:39] he says
[1:19:42] now we also find in Hebrews chapter 12
[1:19:46] and then verse 24. that the New
[1:19:50] Testament
[1:19:51] the blood speaks better things
[1:19:55] the blood is speaking
[1:19:58] the blood has got a voice
[1:20:01] and the voice of the blood
[1:20:04] is the word
[1:20:06] praise the name of Allah so he says the
[1:20:09] blood speaks
[1:20:13] the blood has got a voice what is the
[1:20:16] voice of the blood it is
[1:20:26] the word became
[1:20:45] the life of God in the world
[1:20:51] and the Word was bled for you
[1:20:55] that you might be washed from the filth
[1:20:58] of this prostitute
[1:21:01] praise the name of Allah so the Bible
[1:21:04] tells us
[1:21:07] in the beginning was the one whenever
[1:21:10] the world and the Word was with God
[1:21:13] and the Word was God
[1:21:17] and then in John 1 14.
[1:21:20] that word in its conditions
[1:21:30] that word put on flesh
[1:21:34] and when they were the blood the word
[1:21:36] put on flesh
[1:21:39] in flesh forms
[1:21:50] foreign
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:59] let us go back to the child
[1:23:03] foreign
[1:24:03] but when you hear the words
[1:24:07] you're applying the blood
[1:24:10] when you believe the word the spirit in
[1:24:14] the world
[1:24:15] brings conviction
[1:24:17] and justifies you yeah
[1:24:21] gambo
[1:24:45] and the face look weakness is not
[1:24:47] complicated
[1:24:56] when you have faith in the world
[1:25:01] let us got the message time tested faith
[1:25:04] is
[1:25:10] that face in the Old Testament was the
[1:25:15] same way in the New Testament
[1:25:18] so many people stumble at the thought of
[1:25:22] Faith
[1:25:25] but it is so simple we know to have
[1:25:28] faith how many believe that
[1:25:31] it is so simple you have faith how many
[1:25:36] believe that
[1:25:37] do you know how simple it is
[1:25:40] because you left your home and reached
[1:25:42] here at church
[1:25:47] how many are not going back home today
[1:25:51] now if you don't have that doubt so why
[1:25:55] don't you have faith
[1:25:56] for your full salvation
[1:26:00] praise the name of our Lord but you even
[1:26:02] believe you told the Neighbors at this
[1:26:06] time I will be back sorry and I will be
[1:26:08] doing this question
[1:26:11] uh tomorrow I have a lot of assignments
[1:26:15] praise the name of Allah
[1:26:19] wants us to have friends
[1:26:25] it is so simple we know the Bible says
[1:26:28] he that started the good work
[1:26:32] my question is has it started The Good
[1:26:35] Wife
[1:26:37] then why don't you allow
[1:26:39] with it
[1:26:41] praise the name of Allah
[1:26:50] he that started the good working
[1:26:52] yesterday
[1:26:55] to bring it to completion
[1:26:58] praise the name of Allah the Bible says
[1:27:01] in Hebrews chapter 12
[1:27:03] and then verse
[1:27:06] looking unto Jesus
[1:28:13] you cannot move out of yourself foreign
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:51] what are you using
[1:28:53] faith
[1:28:54] praise the name of our Lord do you think
[1:28:57] when you reach there you will not be
[1:28:58] able to come back
[1:29:00] you have that faith
[1:29:05] that sounds simple
[1:29:08] so even our Salvation you've accepted
[1:29:12] the Lord as your possible
[1:29:14] you have been Justified allow him to
[1:29:17] sacrifice allow him to feel it
[1:29:21] what God requires from us
[1:29:25] praise the name of us and then he says
[1:29:29] you cannot put your heart on again
[1:29:34] unless you have faith you can do it
[1:29:38] never can you draw out your breasts
[1:29:44] unless you have faith you can do it
[1:29:47] that sounds simple faith and then it
[1:29:51] continues
[1:29:53] it's so common yeah
[1:30:00] is
[1:30:40] foreign dipped in the blood
[1:30:44] and rubbed over the door
[1:30:48] isop is just common with
[1:30:53] and that is how it was applied by ISO
[1:30:59] something you could just reach down
[1:31:04] anywhere and get a handful of it
[1:31:10] foreign
[1:31:56] foreign
[1:32:28] before providing it but he provided it
[1:32:32] then he demanded it
[1:32:35] because he knows you can get it oh it's
[1:32:38] all for now praise the name of Allah he
[1:32:41] didn't ask them for the holidays
[1:32:50] so you go and receive the house
[1:32:53] praise the name of Allah you know in
[1:32:56] John chapter 7 verse 39.
[1:32:58] the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:33:01] but now I'm asking you
[1:33:04] has the Holy Ghost been given or not yet
[1:33:07] given um
[1:33:11] foreign
[1:33:55] Jason are you going to get the whole
[1:33:57] lake of water to bring that kind of
[1:33:59] thing
[1:34:03] and God told him you will see it
[1:34:09] now Moses was wondering
[1:34:12] how is this going to be you know
[1:34:14] but God did it anyhow
[1:34:19] and so what happened when God sent the
[1:34:23] quails
[1:34:26] the Bible says they were flying
[1:34:31] one and a half Cubit a meeting not even
[1:34:35] a meter to beat um
[1:34:39] is about one and a half feet
[1:34:42] from here
[1:34:45] so one and half was like from me up to
[1:34:47] here
[1:34:51] let me ask you a question which person
[1:34:55] cannot pick it when it's flying at that
[1:34:56] level
[1:35:00] which person cannot pick it
[1:35:04] and that's how God has given us all
[1:35:06] these things
[1:35:08] is if he requires it he brings it near
[1:35:12] you
[1:35:13] praise the name of Allah so that's why
[1:35:15] brother brand name is
[1:35:17] Faith is common into your quick it is
[1:35:21] so you see that to be justified
[1:35:24] you needed the word you need the same
[1:35:28] word
[1:35:29] it's the blood no I'm sorry and that
[1:35:31] same word
[1:35:33] to be sacrificed
[1:35:36] let us go back to that church
[1:35:39] to be sacrificed it is
[1:35:52] foreign
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:37:27] you need
[1:37:31] praise the name of Allah the church is
[1:37:34] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:38] you need the Holy Ghost
[1:37:42] now let us go to John chapter 3 verse 5.
[1:37:48] praise the name of our Lord
[1:37:51] John chapter 3.
[1:37:55] and then verse 5.
[1:37:58] the Bible says
[1:38:02] Jesus answered very very I say unto you
[1:38:05] except a man be born of water and of the
[1:38:10] spirit he cannot enter into this kingdom
[1:38:13] of God yes
[1:38:20] now that water
[1:38:23] is the word praise the name of Allah and
[1:38:27] then the spirit is the Holy Spirit
[1:38:30] so you need the water with agama be you
[1:38:34] need the word the spirit
[1:38:36] you need the word wait I guess gamble
[1:38:38] you need the spirit but how do you get
[1:38:41] that if not yeah there is not a
[1:38:43] different Basin for water is
[1:38:46] not a different Basin for the world
[1:38:49] and there is not a different Basin for
[1:38:51] the spirit it is
[1:38:57] foreign
[1:39:29] First Corinthians chapter 12 13
[1:39:32] so the Bible says for by one spirit
[1:39:36] all baptized
[1:39:38] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:39:40] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[1:39:44] all made to drink into one
[1:39:47] spiritual participate
[1:40:01] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[1:40:03] by one Spirit
[1:40:05] a holy spirit so the holy spirit that
[1:40:10] justifies
[1:40:12] the same holy spirit
[1:40:14] that sanctifies you
[1:40:18] let us go to First Peter chapter 1 verse
[1:40:21] 2.
[1:40:25] praise the name of our Lord First Peter
[1:40:28] chapter 1 verse
[1:40:32] the scripture says
[1:40:38] according to the foreign knowledge of
[1:40:41] God the Father through sanctification of
[1:40:44] the spirit and to obedience and
[1:40:47] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:49] Grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[1:41:08] praise the name of Allah so you see here
[1:41:12] that he sanctifies Us
[1:41:16] by his spirit
[1:42:17] and make my above
[1:42:31] is the complications
[1:43:33] foreign yeah but you have received the
[1:43:36] spirit of adoption
[1:43:38] calling us the children of God that's
[1:43:42] what we have received praise the name of
[1:43:44] us so the spirit of God
[1:43:47] is much near you as much as you cannot
[1:43:51] obey the word of God
[1:43:53] so if you can obey the world
[1:43:59] when Peter was speaking this word
[1:44:02] where was the Spirit come down it is the
[1:44:07] same principle now that if we can
[1:44:10] received the same word of God
[1:44:15] the same word of God
[1:44:19] praise the name of us
[1:44:30] when he got that man who was beaten to
[1:44:33] death
[1:44:36] he gave him he took him to the Inn yeah
[1:44:55] and then he gave the minister
[1:45:00] he didn't give him three
[1:45:03] praise the name of Allah he gave him two
[1:45:05] pence
[1:45:08] one is the word and the other is the
[1:45:12] spirit
[1:45:12] so as long as you can receive them
[1:45:15] you can also receive this
[1:45:19] that's what we come to church too
[1:45:24] so you are in the right environment
[1:45:27] you are in the right place to be born
[1:45:31] again
[1:45:33] it is not complicated
[1:45:37] but then you see somebody running from
[1:45:41] this job going into another church
[1:45:47] as long as you can receive the word the
[1:45:51] Holy Ghost is there almost for everyone
[1:45:53] coming to yourself as long as you can
[1:45:56] obey the words
[1:45:57] your obedience to the world
[1:46:00] that's good to Acts chapter 5 and verse
[1:46:02] 23.
[1:46:06] praise the name of Allah
[1:46:09] Acts chapter 5.
[1:46:12] and then read the verse 32. he says and
[1:46:16] we Are Witnesses of these things
[1:46:30] by hearing the words
[1:46:37] God has given them the Holy Spirit
[1:46:44] how difficult is that
[1:46:52] it's not difficult we just need to obey
[1:46:57] the word of Twitter
[1:46:59] and then the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:47:04] now let us go in the message
[1:47:08] he says the New Testament
[1:47:11] means new confidence
[1:47:20] the blood life itself is the token
[1:47:25] the life out of the blood is the token
[1:47:30] remember in the Old Testament the actual
[1:47:34] blood of the lamb um
[1:47:39] it is the token of the blood now
[1:47:43] it is the life from the blood
[1:47:47] and that is in the person
[1:47:49] for the token the new token is the new
[1:47:54] life
[1:47:55] that comes through Jesus Christ
[1:47:58] when his blood was shared
[1:48:02] a child and fill it with his presence
[1:48:06] that he might manifest his word
[1:48:10] and his promises to the people
[1:48:15] so they're talking now is the life of
[1:48:19] Jesus Christ how do you receive the life
[1:48:22] of Jesus
[1:48:24] it's not difficult accept the Lord as
[1:48:27] your personal assistant
[1:48:32] will start growing in you
[1:48:35] that's not difficult
[1:48:37] as we've been looking at that chat
[1:48:41] I'm compared to go back to it
[1:48:45] foreign
[1:48:49] you see that in this church you know
[1:48:54] justification
[1:48:58] you need the word sanctification
[1:49:09] let us go to First Peter chapter verse
[1:49:12] 23.
[1:49:16] foreign
[1:49:27] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:49:30] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[1:49:34] which liveth and abideth forever um
[1:49:47] so the Bible says
[1:49:50] we are born again
[1:49:55] by the word of God
[1:49:58] that's the scripture the new birth
[1:50:02] comes Freedom by the word of God now the
[1:50:06] new birth coming by the word of God
[1:50:09] it's not different from the New Birth
[1:50:13] because I work without coming by the
[1:50:14] baptism of the holidays
[1:50:16] it's not different
[1:50:18] the issue is if you are born by the word
[1:50:23] how far is the word from you
[1:50:54] what is the line
[1:51:12] a problem
[1:51:21] keep on obeying the word when the spirit
[1:51:25] comes down
[1:51:27] in other words you are accepting the
[1:51:29] life in the world
[1:51:37] praise the name of us so it's not
[1:51:40] complicated
[1:51:42] foreign
[1:52:06] so if it is going to rain let the word
[1:52:09] be there
[1:52:12] let the word be in our hearts
[1:52:18] then the Holy Ghost keeps on coming
[1:52:22] anointing that word
[1:52:24] giving that word you know ability to
[1:52:27] grow
[1:52:29] and then you are able to have the life
[1:52:31] of Jesus Christ
[1:52:34] is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:52:38] that's what we should desire
[1:52:40] don't run for emotions
[1:52:45] and that's the problem we have we don't
[1:52:48] want to run for this emotions
[1:52:52] the Holy Ghost is suffering
[1:52:57] you can have emotions
[1:53:01] but it's the same holy ghosts
[1:53:05] praise the name of Allah when he Saul
[1:53:08] was anointed
[1:53:10] he prophesied when David was anointed
[1:53:14] prophesy
[1:53:18] the anointing of Soul
[1:53:21] be more powerful than the anointing of
[1:53:24] damage
[1:53:26] you can read the scriptures praise the
[1:53:29] name of our Lord let us go there in the
[1:53:31] book of Us
[1:53:33] Praise the name of Allah in the book of
[1:53:36] First somewhere
[1:53:38] I just want to get that scripture
[1:53:43] first somewhere somewhere like soccer
[1:53:49] let us go to First Samuel chapter
[1:53:53] 15.
[1:54:00] first Samuel chapter 16 rather
[1:54:06] and then verse 13.
[1:54:11] then someone took the Horn of oil and
[1:54:13] anointed him in the Middle East of his
[1:54:16] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:54:18] Upon David from that day forward so
[1:54:20] Samuel arose up and went to Rama
[1:54:24] Adidas yo
[1:54:49] upon his head and kissed him and said
[1:54:53] it is not because the Lord has anointed
[1:54:55] me to be Captain over his inheritance
[1:55:11] and when thou art departed from me today
[1:55:13] then Thou shalt find two men by Rafa
[1:55:16] SEPTA in the border of Benjamin at Zelda
[1:55:19] and they will say unto thee the asses
[1:55:21] which though went to seek are found and
[1:55:24] law thy father has left the key of the
[1:55:27] asses and Sorrows for you saying what
[1:55:30] shall I do for my son one of us
[1:56:00] and the spirit of the Lord will come
[1:56:02] upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with
[1:56:05] them and shall be turned into a new
[1:56:08] another person
[1:56:11] foreign
[1:56:43] let us go there
[1:56:46] praise the name of Allah Acts chapter 9.
[1:56:51] and then we read from verse
[1:56:56] 17.
[1:56:58] and ananyas went his way and entered
[1:57:01] into the house and putting his hands on
[1:57:04] him said brother Soul the Lord even
[1:57:07] Jesus that appeared unto me in the way
[1:57:10] although cometh has sent me that though
[1:57:13] might receive thy sight and be filled
[1:57:16] with the Holy ghosts
[1:57:29] um
[1:57:33] and immediately they are fell from his
[1:57:36] eyes as he had been scales and received
[1:57:39] the sight forthworth and arose and was
[1:57:42] baptized among ago
[1:57:44] UMass
[1:57:51] praise the name of our Lord so ananias
[1:57:54] was sent to lay his hands on Souls
[1:57:58] received two things
[1:58:00] receive his side
[1:58:03] and to receive his holy
[1:58:06] now when ananias laid his hands on Souls
[1:58:11] the Bible says the eyes
[1:58:15] foreign
[1:58:51] foreign
[1:59:34] Ty of God
[1:59:38] is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:59:58] do you have the life of Jesus
[2:00:01] is that life in you
[2:00:04] praise the name of us now in the message
[2:00:08] wisdom but his face into a magazine he
[2:00:12] says
[2:00:14] but Faith only has one thing
[2:00:18] life that's all that will say
[2:00:23] Thy word is
[2:00:28] true
[2:00:29] he is
[2:00:35] Faith only hangs right there
[2:00:39] that's right and won't take it
[2:00:42] holy spirit
[2:00:47] that's why our faith grows in our quick
[2:00:50] results
[2:00:56] that's the only place that faith can
[2:00:58] work
[2:01:00] is When Faith hears the wife
[2:01:04] and believes that it is
[2:01:12] it produces from what the word says
[2:01:18] how did he make the world do you believe
[2:01:21] the world was in goodness
[2:01:27] how did he make it yeah
[2:01:30] and that's what we are here this morning
[2:01:34] God speaks his wife we received that
[2:01:37] word
[2:01:41] then we become the manifestation of the
[2:01:43] world
[2:01:46] in the beginning
[2:01:49] God created
[2:01:51] in Genesis
[2:02:54] and then the Bible
[2:03:50] why did you call foreign
[2:03:56] foreign
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:56] foreign
[2:05:56] God
[2:06:43] let us go to Colossians chapter three
[2:06:47] and then verse
[2:06:51] Colossians
[2:06:56] as I try to wind up
[2:07:01] if you build risen with Christ
[2:07:07] sitteth on the right hands
[2:07:13] set your affection on things above not
[2:07:16] on the things on the earth Brothers
[2:07:22] for you are dead and your life is hid
[2:07:26] with Christ in God foreign
[2:07:53] let it be no longer you but let it be
[2:07:57] Christ to Christ
[2:08:00] becoming our being
[2:08:04] Christ taking over all our lives
[2:08:08] no longer I that living
[2:08:11] but Christ that leaves
[2:08:15] praise the name of it Colossians chapter
[2:08:18] 2 verse six
[2:08:19] as you have therefore received Christ
[2:08:22] Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him
[2:08:28] yes
[2:08:33] so if you have received Christ
[2:08:36] Walk In Christ
[2:08:51] you know let Christ be what you are in
[2:08:56] look at please
[2:08:58] he has taken over your thoughts he has
[2:09:02] taken over your speech he has taken over
[2:09:05] your your actions
[2:09:07] let him be everything
[2:09:10] don't limit himself
[2:09:14] but even at your places
[2:09:17] even the places where are you staying
[2:09:20] even the places where you study foreign
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:47] let us continue
[2:09:54] with him in baptism wherein also you are
[2:09:58] risen we
[2:10:01] of God who has raised him from the dead
[2:10:04] and you being dead in your sins and
[2:10:07] uncircumcision of your flesh
[2:10:09] has he quickened together with him
[2:10:12] having forgiven you all trespasses
[2:10:19] foreign
[2:10:46] verse 13. so now he says we are buried
[2:10:51] with him in baptism
[2:10:53] then we are raised with him
[2:10:56] so we live with him
[2:10:58] so then if you have buried your old
[2:11:02] nature
[2:11:05] you need to raise in the newness of
[2:11:08] Christ his life
[2:11:12] you live in the spirit no longer
[2:11:17] but the Christ
[2:11:20] taking over your life
[2:11:29] you need to live in Christ
[2:11:33] is the Life of Christ
[2:11:35] was put on display
[2:11:39] when you put some it is on the door
[2:11:42] and when you get on the door where you
[2:11:46] get the the the the the the
[2:11:48] the location of the place
[2:11:52] maybe if there are males they are put
[2:11:55] around that area
[2:13:01] by then
[2:13:14] what fruit is that
[2:13:22] that one is abusive
[2:13:25] like when you go to the garages all
[2:13:29] those points they are putting a pole of
[2:13:30] electricity
[2:13:36] as if by mentioning bad data watch they
[2:13:39] can get strings to put the pole up
[2:13:52] or
[2:13:54] with your colleagues
[2:13:57] a despise of others
[2:14:01] one who doesn't care

[2:14:15] doesn't want to pay dates
[2:14:19] foreign
[2:14:49] worlds of critics
[2:14:53] and the last critic is the critical is
[2:14:55] always there is satanism
[2:15:02] praise the name of us but he will have
[2:15:05] nothing to accuse you
[2:15:07] if he sees the life of Jesus Christ

[2:16:28] that your price is paid
[2:16:31] one God has received you and that is the
[2:16:36] token remember that is
[2:16:39] we have sometimes allowed it seven to
[2:16:43] take reason the rules and allowed it
[2:16:45] accepting the word accepting Christ as
[2:16:48] your personal savior
[2:16:50] when you get happy enough it was another
[2:16:53] shout out that is all okay
[2:16:57] then you got it and we find out that all
[2:17:01] of it was wrong
[2:17:03] the talking is the token
[2:17:07] it is
[2:17:10] as persons together
