our country and the king of Jericho sent out sent sent unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the country and

in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may get seated amen amen it's such a cold evening but we thank God who has helped us to make it to church amen so for our for our study tonight I'll be taking the text short text the power of the testimony praise the Lord the power of the testimony praise the Lord so now we have read we have taken our scripture from Joshua praise the Lord and we know this is a continuation of the Journey of the children of Isel praise the Lord and so now here they reach Jero and Joshua takes out two men to go out spy the land and when they reached there praise the Lord the Bible says that when they got there they reached the house of RAB the harot and when they got there information reached the king of Jero that you're here but the enemy has come the enemy has invaded and when the information reached him he sent out Messengers to go reach out to RAB and when they reached RAB they asked where are the men the men that you are keeping our our enemies and they have come to destroy us and they tried to speak to her so she could give them up but in verse four we notice the response of RAB she knew well she had the two men that had been sent SP the land but she had something compelling her not to give them up praise the Lord why Bible says and the woman took the two men and hid them and said th there came men unto me accepted that she had seen the men but she said she didn't know who they were praise the Lord she couldn't let them go and the B says in verse and it came to pass about the time she's trying narrate she's narrating to The Messengers it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out where the men went I what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them the entire nation did not want to receive them they wanted to see them destroyed praise the Living God and now when this woman received them she's pretending like she has not seen them praise the Lord so she says I saw them they came but at the time of closing of the door it was dark so I don't know where they went but they moved out shortly you run after them you be able to find them and you'll capture them and she says but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the strocks of FL which had laid in order in order upon the roof and now the men who had been sent by the king they pursued after them the way of Jordan and the and as soon as they which pursued after them were not were gone out they shut the Gat and before they were laid down she came up upon she came up unto unto them upon the roof and she said unto them now this is the reason why RAB would not let go of these two spice she had heard of the testimony she had heard of the work of God she knew who these men were she knew they had brought a message of Destruction upon Jero and so whoever did not receive them she knew whoever didn't receive them would be destroyed at their hands so she was compelled somehow contain them so she could seek of their favor and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given has given you the land and your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you that is the testimony she had had about she said I know that the Lord has given you this life and we have heard of what God has how God has dealt with you and how God has dealt with your enemies the word of God has reached out unto us and his wonders has reached out unto us and every one of us is under terror terror is Fallen upon us all and all the inhabitants of the land they all faint because of you praise the Lord that is the testimony she had about and so she couldn't let them go praise the Lord and now it says here in verse 10 for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you praise the Lord she was in there in Jero but she had heard what God had done at the Red Sea so the word of God had spread it had gone before the [Applause] spice God had promised Joshua not to fear and he promised him I will go before you and I will fight for you and now here we see the testimony Raab is speaking he says we've heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for when you came out of Egypt and what you did un the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side Jordan and whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had had these things she said our hearts did melt they heard they had heard the word of God they had heard of the testimony of God how God had dealt with his people Israel had the hand of the Lord how God had dealt with Israel on their way to Jero and she says we are aright and our hearts did melt when we had what God had done in your MST neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven now this isab testifying about the Lord the Lord she was a harot praise the Lord she was living in a kind of life that was not but yet she had heard about the word of God the Lord the Tes had reached unto her that there is a God above all there is a God who fights praise the Lord heard there is a God powerful than anything that exist and while the rest of Israel was afraid to attack in there when the enemy had heard what God had done the enemy was already AF I saw one here in Jero is testifying saying I know your testimony even before you tell me I heard of the hand of the Lord upon you and we are all afraid and no man has the and everyone is fainted because of you for the Lord your God is called above heaven and in the earth beneath oh what a testimony that they were carrying what the testimony that they that walk with God are carrying praise the Lord they say they had a legacy they had a legacy that God was with them and the enemy was already aright because of the word of their testimony the Lord was with them he had promised to josu promised promised Moses and Aon you would be with them that would give them the land praise the Lord and as they were moving the word went before them before they even reached Jero the word of God had reached there Legacy of the testimony of the word of God has already reached the land of the enem praise the Lord and as long as he is with us as long as his word is with us as long as this this testimony is with us the testimony of the word of God this testimony will spread out the world praise the Lord and we shall see the hand of God walking before the people and by this our testimony the testimony of our Salvation the testimony of the word of God and the power thereof we shall go to all parts of the world to all parts of the Earth and like Raab said that the entire Jero fainted the Earth shall tremble at this spoken word praise the Lord why because this word has power praise the Lord because it is the Lord himself so when Jero heard it they were afraid and they began hunting for the Spice they could not let them spread into account only two men that put the entire nation at stake and the King was afraid and he was very frightened to hear that they have entered his praise the Lord but that is the word of God is so powerful praise the Lord it is so powerful that the YY trembles at the word of God the word of God is so powerful that there is nothing that can stand his presence praise the Lord when the word Goes Forth the Bible calls it very sharp it is too sharp praise the Lord that it cuts and the enemy praise the Lord when he hear that is coming is up because he knows the power that in this world that's why theti Jero was up why they were afri because of the testimony they had that God had done in the midst of Israel and he promised it is written in the Book of Psalms 91 thou sh tread upon the lion and the Young Lion and the dragon thou shall trample under feet praise the Lord because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him is the word of God to them that believe praise the Lord he says he has set his love upon me therefore I will deliver him I will set him on high because he has known my name the Bible says he shall call upon me and I will answer him so when we call upon him he says I will answer him and he says I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and H him that's exactly what God was doing he had sent his word he had given his word to Abraham praise the Lord and say that land will I give upon you and upon those that shall come after you and when he spoke the same word to Moses andon and Joshua praise the Lord God set himself to go before the people so even before they reach the Land There is already fear upon the people why because the word of God had gone before them the word of God had gone before the children of Israel the word of God was before them just like he promised to Joshua he had gone before them he had prepared the land for them much as they were afraid of the people that in Jero God had gone before them to fight for them because that's the promise that had given to Joshua I will fight for you I fight the amorites I fight the canites he said you will fight all the enemies and said stand still Joshua why because his word has power the word of God has power over all our enemies and verse 12 says of of the Book of Joshua chapter 2 now I pray you this is now RAB after she had come into countenance with that testimony she had seen the testimony which she had now she had seen she saw the people now she brought them in she had this word of God says I am not determined to let go of you praise the same way God met he met God met Jacob when Jacob saw him when he saw God he says I shall not let go of you until you bless me praise the Lord he had gotten the opportunity to come close to God so he could not let go God go away he blessed him and now here is RAB leaving a f the life but when she saw the people who they had talked about when she saw the manifestation of the testimony of the power of God in the people she said I will not let you go praise the Lord even when she was scared of the king she lied to the king in order to receive her testimony from the spies so she says now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house praise the Lord now she required of a true token she says give me a true token you and that you will save alive my father was her prayer save her family because she knew that the testimony she had about the hand of God and how God had determined to give over their lands the children of Israel she knew that it is these people her or destroy her she showed them kindness and she requested them she says I pray you now that I've showed you kindness you also show kindness unto my father's house give me a true token that you shall save my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all they that have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you not this our business it shall be when the Lord has given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with you then she let them down she let them down by a C through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she D upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers returned and afterwards may you go your way and the man said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land now this is the token that they required of herry that she required of them behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou did let us down B and thou sh bring thy father and thy mother and thyren and all thy father's household home unto thee they left a token a token to redeem her the house when we come and we look at that token your house will be safe and we shall not destroy you praise the Lord and God has provided us a way of escape from the oncoming storm provided a way for the people to be redeemed so now when they came upon her they were leaving her she request I want a token because I know that is by thy hand of of thy God that I shall find Mercy and I will not be destroy and now they gave her a token praise the Lord they gave her token the Scarlet Threat by which she let them down they said you TI it around the door the and you get your entire house father your mother and all your house and keep them in that was the instruction and the other instruction was do not speak don't speak this the praise the Lord because they had given them they had given her the word it was an assurance for her Redemption so they said do not let it out but they tell you let it out you have broken why it was a secret between her and the spies praise the Lord and remember last Wednesday was say when God was speaking the prophet and was giving him the instructions about the pools on the third pool he told him not to speak not to explain anything why because it was the secret it was the word praise the Lord it was something that was binding it had to be a personal encounter so now this woman has come into an encounter a personal encounter this secret was only given unto her for her Redemption it was a word that was left with her and as long as she kept the word she was safe from the oncoming storm that was coming their way praise the Lord God has given us his word God has given us the spoken word and he has given us his word as long as we keep that word as long as you keep this my word you shall be safe praise the Lord you have heard this word the testimony of the spoken word and we know what God is capable of doing because his word never fails promised that in the last days praise the Lord he shall send us a messenger he shall send us a prophet shall send us a spoken word the word shall be a guide the word that shall help us to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and as long as we have this word God is very faithful to his word we receive this Word of Promise and we keep it ourselves God is faithful praise the Lord because he says that when I send out that word praise the Lord that word shall be followed by a great storm shall be followed by fire shall burn like an oven shall burn Earth but he said they praise the Lord that have received this word they that have kept this word they that walk by this word that live by this world prise the lord in that day they shall overcome praise the Lord they shall overcome and they shall not be destroyed by the storm that is coming destroy the world praise the Lord so now Raab says give me a token and the token they gave was the token of the word this word give unto you go get this threat and tie it around your house it is for a token and as long as we see that token we shall not destroy your house praise the Lord when Israel was leaving Egypt God gave them a token and says as long as they see that token I not destroy you and now to ask the gentle Bri God has given us a token the token of the word praise the Lord and as long as the word is there as long as you have the words you shall pass over the oncoming storm that is a promise praise the Lord and his promises never fail praise the Lord so he said give me a token and they gave her a token praise the Lord and God gave us a token he gave Jesus to die on the cross the shed blood cleans all sins praise the Lord and in the evening time said I would send the voice of the spoken word to lead the people and he said when I see the token when I see the blood when we shall see that threat we shall pass over you but he says you have to keep in the house because outside isn't safe and the voice of the seventh angel proclaimed it was calling out the to come out of Jero to get into a saer Zone to come out ofon to get into nothing else but the words because it's only in the words that the bride is safe praise the Lord and says when you get in there when you get into the word keep yourself into the word keep the test of the word over evil it has power over fire because he proved it right in the Old Testament in the old days he proved that his word is powerful and powerful than anything that ever existed when he L Mr sh get into the fire praise the Lord and because of his words could not touch them praise the lord we have seen we have had so many people that have kept the word of God and they been able overcome The Temptations the Trouble Comes their way heard of John the Divine he was boiled the heat the fire could not kill the word of God there kill him why he kept the word when he received the word he never let the word depart kept the word we have received the word of God we have received the message of the hour let's keep in that word let's keep in the message let's keep in the spoken word that's where our self zone is because the Bible says this Earth is going to burn as an oven as an oven and if God spoke it the Earth shall truly burn as and but to them that have received the word the word has the power to keep them from the fire that shall come to destroy this world so now let's keep the words and keep in the words and live by the words for this word is our testimony this word is our testimony praise the Lord Israel the word that they heard that they were to be given that land that was their testimony and as long as they moved by their testimony and they kept that testimony God was obl obligated to go before them the Lord to fight for them and as long as we have the words it is it is God's obligation to go before us to fight for us to overcome for us he says to Joshua don't fear just take me at my word I will go before you and I will fight for you praise the Living God so what we have to as Christians is to keep the word of God the word that we have received for it is our testimony praise the name of living for the scripture says grieve not the holy spirit of God wherein you were you were sealed until the day of your Redemption praise the Lord because that our token that is the word of God that is the token that is given unto us keep inside the house do not move out keep inside the house because the moment you move out of the house it shall eat you up you shall be destroyed by the storm that is coming keep the house and make sure you ENT your house SE under the token as long as they under that token you are safe and we shall not destroy you praise the Lord and as long as we are in his house as long as we are in the world we shall be safe so now the testimony of Israel caused fear in Jero because God was with them they never had their own part fight but the word of their test shook the enemy praise the Lord and God promised us that in the evening time there is a light that shall go forth he never said that the evening time we shall manifest with it but he promised that there is a light and that light is the word of God the the word that brings life upon us the word that brings life Resto us and after it restores us it gives us the Assurance after it has given us the the B of the Holy Spirit which is the seal which is the token praise the Lord so in the evening time which time we know we are living we know we have a token the word of God praise the Lord because God is his own word and as long as we have the word we have the power to defeat the enemy as long as we have the word of God have the power to defeat anything that comes our way as long as have the word of God you have the power to speak things into existence as long as you have the word of God you conquer the enemy because the word of God has the power down every stronghold of the enemy it was the word that went before to Jero before they even crossed into Jero the word was there and had brought the enemy on their knees and says nation is ight and all their strength is gone out and they F upon their feet because of this the word of God praise the Lord so let's keep the word of God let's live by that word of God it shall help us to defeat the enemy he shall help us to overcome the enemy and by that word we know that Jesus when he was tempted praise the Lord he overcame by nothing else but by the word of God why because the word of God has the power to overcome evil it has the power to overcome evil so as long as you're keeping yourself in the world you don't need to struggle why because God is mandated to protect his word so he shall fight for you before you know you overcome the enemy before you know you f over a trap before you know you are only able to see all this is what the enemy had said for God has given you the grace to pass over the enemy why because of the power of His words praise the Lord and now the prophet says in the book The Great Warrior joshuaa said now we are going to see what the land looks like so he sent out some they went andab HD them through the night I want not another thing watch what taken place when they were up there Rab's house RAB she hid them under his FL on top of her roof sent the men out of the those that had come and come back and said look and she came back and said look now watch how God is moving take this encouragement back josua say all this country Fain because of you we have heard what the Lord has done for you I just love that say don't worry God is got a good time coming by and by all the country is afraid of you when we heard that the Lord dried up the Red Sea and let you cross Pharaoh's Army give you food by man out in the oldness and put a bre serpent out for an atonement he done all these things for you and I known what you done destroy o and other kings I seen what you did destroyed and when we had this and we headed our way we just fainted there is no more courage left in no one and this testimony that she had increased in the rest of Jero it reached out every denomination every tribe in Jero had the testimony of God and I once said this this evening that this testimony of the word of God shall increase and reach out every denomination and he shall create fear in the hearts of the the people and the people will fall and give up themselves and allow only Christ to live in their lives this testimony of the message of the hour which proclaims the coming of Jesus Christ this word that testifies of the uncoming sto praise the Lord which is the Testament of God in the evening time shall go forth and then shall go forth prise the Lord it shall create fear in the hearts of the people and it shall cause many until repentance the testimony that the spies carried that Israel carried caus the hot to fall down upon the word of God and she repented and required protection she required Redemption she wanted to be Redeemed by the word of the testimony so this word the evening time the evening light shall go forth this testimony shall lighten up and it shall cause many to fear and Men shall come un repentance because of the Declaration of the message of the and this is the time that we living the time of the spoken words going forth at such a season of the third pool taking us back the original words the word of Our Testimony praise the Lord preparing the hearts of the people remember when the word of God Came John he was preparing the hearts of the people to receive the first coming of Jesus but again God has given us this word the word that you believe the word that I believe the word that you testify of is the promise that God gave unto us that in the evening time he shall send forth his word and this same word which is the testimony in the evening time is the word that shall bring so many and repentance is the one that shall cause fear into the strongholds of the enemy to bring many unto repentance to prepare the hearts of the people to receive Jesus Christ for the second time and now to us that have received it praise the Lord the spice said RAB now that you have received this word you must keep this word and you must apply the token and everyone of you must keep under the token praise the lord we have received the word we have obeyed the voice of the of Malachi 4 you have received the voice of Malachi 4 we heard the spoken word youy the spoken word keep yourself in that word don't move outside because when you move outside the world you will be destroyed but keep under the words because it is our protection it has the power to protect us from the oncoming St for the scripture says they overcame him the Enemy by the blood of the lamb and by the power and by the word of their testimony praise the Lord is the testimony let's start the Book of Revelation 12 we can read out a few scriptures here and there appeared a great one in heaven a woman closed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of stars and she being with child travailing in birth and and pained to be delivered and there appeared another one in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head [Music] verse six and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where where she had a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a th 2,000 and three score and there was V in heaven M Mikel and his angels fought against the dragon and dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found in in neither was there Place found anymore in heaven and the dragon was cast out that that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which auses which aused them before our go day and night for the was declaring now salvation has come and and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ because the are of Brethren is cast down which CH them before God and night how does he choose them praise the Lord he causes them to error and condemns them of sin and tells them they're not worthy to live before God they not worthy speak to God not worthy to partake of the inheritance chooses them day and night that's what the voice was speaking but the same voice praise the Lord say in Revelation chapter in verse 11 but they overcame him he chose them night and day but yet they overcame him by the blood of the lamb praise the Lord why because God had provided a way for us he gave Jesus Christ to die for our sins and his blood is upon the altar praise the Lord interceding for us there and night so are choos is are choosing blood still applies praise the Lord and the Bible says and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb because they are protected by the the blood of the Lamb the blood of Jesus Jus christs for us our sins there and night praise the Lord overcame him by the blood of the Lamb the blood of Jesus Shield praise the Lord and also by the power of their testimony so they cared the testimony of the word Lord they believe the words and they were determined to go by the word so when you live by the words you are able to defeat the enemy when you live by the words you defeat Evil by the defeat Satan the Bible says they overcame by the blood of Jesus Christ also overcame by the word of their testimony prise the Lord and they loved not their lives even until death oh praise Lord this is our testimony we have the blood of Jesus Christ it cleanses us daily it washes us daily it cleanses us daily the choosers are choosing not worthy you're not worthy but the blood still applies praise the Lord Cher Satan the Devil is choosing us you cannot make it to the rupture but the word of God still stands sure and by the word of God shall overcome the enemy and shall make it the Rapture Cher looks at our mistakes praise the Lord and capitalizes on them and says look at yourself this is your mistake you're such a corome person short tempered you did this and the other you can make it to the r blood of Jesus Christ says you are worthy I died for you and the blood applies and then the word of God which is our testimony says we shall make it why because we were sealed by the Holy Spirit until the day of our rupture praise the Lord where the choos chooses us and says you are so weak you can't even pray you can't make the rupt praise the lord we have the word of testimony because Jesus promised us that he's going up to prepare a place and that is coming for us and if he's coming he's coming for his word and if you have his word keep his word if you keep his testimony it is us that Christ is coming for so regardless of the accusations of the eny as long as we keep the word of God we shall make it better praise the Lord he says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their Testament they loved not their work they loved not their lives praise the Lord they loveed not their lives praise the Lord that's what the scripture says they never love their lives un they would go parting L they would go parting L they would go partying they would go into parties into drinking and doing all those kind of things and enjoying and doing this and the other but they never did it why they never loved those that life they sacrificed their lives for the testimony they were carrying and the grace of God was always that sufficient for them to give them the strength praise the Lord when their bodies were wanting and their Spirit was Ving C the grace was there the spirit was there the blood was there to give them strength the blood is there to give us strength the speed is there to give us strength to encourage us stay in the Life praise the Lord so even when the rest of the world is going parting and doing all those kind of things that life is dead in you praise the Lord you don't love it praise the Lord even until death you don't love it why you have the word of the testimony you're carrying the testimony which is the word of God which is Al in your life and you will be able to overcome the world by that word of testimony praise the Lord they never love their lives at the expense of the word of their testimony they live by the spoken word is their testimony they live to glorify God and not exalt themselves they teach they preach the gospel truth to win source to Christ and not unto themselves amaz glories before men they are lifeless doing service not unto themselves but unto God by that testimony they overcome the world they overcame the world and they overcome evil because they are protected by the word praise the Lord that is the assurance that we have as long as we keeping the testimony the word of God the promise of our day praise the Lord a quick look at the at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming the prophet says we bring out the truth of this proposition which proposition of overcoming the evil of overcoming the World by the word of God by the word of our Tony it says in MTH 4 in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that that corresponded exactly the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the L of the flesh the last of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word if F the person Temptation if F to the person Temptation Of Satan failing to use the word Adam fell in direct obedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now he says let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer it is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because the word Can't Fail we overcome the world we overcome evil we overcome the Devil by the word of God you speak the word of God when you're sick you speak the sickness you speak the word of God the sickness and that the word of God shall vanish the Lord the promise and if we believe it shall come to pass why because the word of God never fails you speak the word and allow God to do his work praise the Lord he will come to defend it upon your faith speak the word and let God move keeping the word the word speak the word that is the testimony praise the Lord that proves that Christ lives in our lives and if he lives and if he lives we live also with him do not move outside the word because our protection is in the word we are tempted we fail often but the bride has the blood upon the and the word of God is there protect her do not move outside we run short of Grace and live behind the seal make sure that you keep your house in there keep it in the house keep it behind behind this token behind this stre the Scarlet threat let keep behind the word let the word go before us let us speak by the word leave by the words let us walk by the words let us testify by the words let's do everything by the words and the word of God shall go before us and God will help us over all our weaknesses by the word will help you overcome the Lord and now God at one time visited a woman praise the Lord who was in the like manner like theot RAB she had also lived and she had been married to different different men praise the Lord now here Jesus comes at the well and Jesus finds her praise the Lord and begins to speak to her and the conversation flows she asks of water she says but I cannot give water and the conversation flows why the testimony was coming close to her it was coming close to her and in verse 20 she says our fathers worshiped in this mountain yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where ought worship Jesus says unto her that is John 4 verse 21 woman believe me the hour comes when he shall nether in this mountain Jerusalem worship the father you you worship you know not what we know what we wor for salvation is of the Jews but the hour comes and now is praise the Lord the hour had come for this hot the had come for this woman to receive her testimony praise the Lord receive her word which was her Redemption and the Bible says for the hour has come and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him and Truth Jesus was speaking the testy he was speaking the word of life was he was testifying of God before this woman and when she had the testim she received the power and the Bible says she could not remain there but she ran out to go and tell others about the word so she ran out Lord and it says in verse 28 the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and say to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ they went out of the city and came unto him what was that she had received the T praise the Lord and the word of God had to increase praise the Lord had to increased so the tesy went out when they heard of the T of Jesus they also came because it was life andto them the word of God is our testimony RAB was a witness to it she believed it without seeing she said I heard I have heard that's enough for me I've heard it she was persistent she said I know we are going to be destroyed what can I do show me favor let me save my father's house praise the Lord she says I know the word of God it went out and said here must be given over to them and we are going to be destroyed it was a testimony that there there was coming and oncoming storm praise the Lord it is a testimony the word that we are carrying there is coming a storm that is going to destroy the world and now here is the hot she says I want to save my family and the prophet says this salot Gentile watch all her family she was a Believer all her family had to get under that scet streak talken she was a gentile praise the Lord they had to go under it for they would perish they had heard of the r of God had heard of the displaying signs and miracles of god among people and they had to receive it she had to receive it God destroying Angel was coming they knew it and Joshua was that angel they were inline praise the Lord and so is every nation in the world in line of God's judgment this little old harot she had she had heard Faith cometh by hearing she said all the country is disturbed about you that's right now the spies that we are sent in there to make arrangements and so forth she honored those men she wanted to be saved I know that you are God that your God is God I have heard what great things that he's done I know what he's done to the different nations and I see that those who accept him are saved and those who does not accept him are destroyed but I want to leave she said oh my there you are I want to leave notice Jero had had what God was doing but they didn't want to make the to take the warning and there there isn't a denomination in this country around but but what's hard what God is doing they don't want to take the warning this great power and signs had been displayed and he done crossed right through the the Dead Sea and and made and created things and made frogs and [Music] Ice they know it it was not secret and RAB said I have heard that I don't want to perish with those unbeliever no sir no judgment had to follow it because they was right in line she know it so they made a way for her to escape they must have believed that their own big denomination of Jericho was able to resist the wrath of God that's what many of them are thinking today oh surely God W do that that's what Satan said to Eve surely God won't he will he said he would he said he would destroy the world and surely he will because that's what he said he do and that's his words except a man be born and these signs shall follow them that that are born this will all man know you are my disciples for all wanted to do what happened they were shut up they were shut up because they never believed what the spice were saying but those that believed and received their test praise the Lord when the angel was passing and the angel that was leading praise the Lord he even Joshua when he came and passed by those that believed the word of God those that believe the testimony they were spared praise the Lord RAB and her house were spared but the rest of Jero was brought out said keeping those and it shall be that will take ever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and will be Guiltless whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head any if any be upon him that is the word that they left with him praise the lord we must be born again and if you you're born again you can't be born again unless you've accepted the word and if you have accepted the word you believe it in your heart and you make confession and when you make confession you believe Jesus Christ and when you believe him receive him praise the Lord and when you receive him Prophet teaches us that when you obey his words and you obey his testimony praise the Lord your obedience upon your obedience God gives the token which is the Holy Spirit The Life of Christ the life of God in us the life of God in the church and as long as the life is in there we shall not face destruction but we shall live praise the Lord why that life has the power remember Jesus when he had passed through Gad when he had reached that mad man was in the toms praise the Lord who had kept himself in the Toms but the Devils were keeping him in there he cut himself he was bleeding all over he was taken captive and the devil had held him Captain but when Jesus passed over praise the Lord Devils began to scream the Devils began to tremble why the Devils had had of the Tes of Jesus that at the feet of Jesus every demon was cast out that at the name of Jesus the Devils could tremble so they cried out and says we know you we've heard about you don't destroy us you spare us and send us away they were crying why because of the name of Jesus because of the word of God praise the Lord because of the testim of the word of God so this word that we have is able to cast out div div tremble at the name of Jesus so if you carry the name of Jesus with you the devil shall tremble praise the Lord that's why sometimes we hear people say those that maybe go to worship other gods and go to in of other gods you hear them say that man he has a fire around him you don't joke with him you don't play with him they say he has a fire around him let me give you this testimony as I close let me give you this testimony about the word of God praise the lord we have a case that is in the court a case about one of our companies and now the other the respondents we the applicants The respondent Who offended us he spends day and night those which doctors and shrines praise the Lord and now I told my other people that we have a God who will fight for us we are at the right side of the law and by all means we shall win this case so now the first appearing of the hearing of the first application at the court I didn't future there and now this the the respondent he carried along two men from from after coming there is that District they were doctors they were outside the chambers
