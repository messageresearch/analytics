[7:46] things.
[7:49] He takes [music and singing]
[7:50] broken soil
[7:54] to bring us [music and singing] golden
[7:57] grain.

[8:05] broken clouds to bring us [singing] rain
[8:10] and broken
[8:13] [singing] grave
[8:15] [music]
[8:16] to give us [singing] daily bread.
[8:19] [music]
[8:21] Oh, and broken
[8:24] bread [music]
[8:27] to give us strength [singing] again.
[8:35] For God
[8:38] to [music] use us,
[8:40] we must be brokeen [music]
[8:44] down.
[8:46] So the seed [music and singing]
[8:49] of his word
[8:51] can be sown.
[8:56] [music]
[8:58] Man
[9:00] cannot live [music]
[9:03] by bread
[9:05] alone. [music]
[9:08] So when
[9:11] the [singing and music] seed
[9:14] is grown, [music and singing] deep
[9:16] inside your heart, you find the greatest
[9:20] [singing and music]
[9:22] love
[9:25] the world has ever known.
[9:31] So Lord, [music] if I'm going to be

[12:31] [music]
[12:32] So Lord, [singing] if I'm going to be

[12:42] [music] you.
[12:45] Cuz you have [singing] a way of taking

[13:10] and make me just like you.
[13:16] Lord, oh Lord, [singing]
[13:19] Lord, if I'm going to [music]
[13:21] be broken,
[13:24] I would rather be broken [music] for
[13:27] you.
[13:29] Oh, cuz you [singing] have a way [music]
[13:32] of taking broken things and [singing]
[13:36] making them just [music]
[13:38] like new.
[13:41] Lord, I don't mind the pain.
[13:47] Do [singing and music] all you must do.
[13:52] Oh, take me and [singing and music]
[13:54] break me and make me just like you. I
[14:00] want to hear you now as [singing] the
[14:01] church. [music] So Lord, if I'm going.
[14:03] So Lord, if
[14:07] Oh, I'd rather [singing] rather be
[14:11] moving for you.
[14:14] For you [singing] have a way of taking
[14:18] [music] broken,
[14:20] making, and making [singing] them just
[14:23] like new. [music] I don't mind,
[14:26] [singing]
[14:27] Lord. I don't mind the pain.
[14:31] Oh, do [singing and music] what you must
[14:35] do.
[14:37] Take me. Take me [singing and music] and
[14:39] break me and make me just like you.
[14:46] We're going to sing [music] it just
[14:47] [singing] one last time.
[14:49] We'll be like Jeremiah.
[14:52] We'll be like Jeremiah. [music]
[14:55] Jeremiah
[14:57] who went to the porter's house.
[15:01] and the port was breaking
[15:05] and remolding.
[15:07] So sometimes God breaks us.
[15:11] [music]
[15:12] Maybe we are too proud.
[15:16] He breaks you [music] a bit and then he
[15:19] molds you again.
[15:21] And the prophet [music] says
[15:24] that he there was a shepherd.
[15:29] Yes. [music]
[15:30] And uh he he got one of his sheep.
[15:36] He got [music] one.
[15:39] The the the the sheep was not moving.
[15:41] Anyhow,
[15:46] and he broke the leg.
[15:50] I said [music] that must be a very cruel
[15:52] thing.
[15:56] But he said I broke the leg [music]
[16:01] because I wanted my sheep to know that I
[16:03] am the shepheran.
[16:08] [music]
[16:09] So sometimes God breaks us
[16:14] because we [music] are failing to listen
[16:16] to his voice.
[16:20] [music]
[16:21] But the prayer is
[16:24] if we have to be broken at any one
[16:26] [music] point in our lives,
[16:31] then we'd rather be [music] broken. For
[16:33] him
[16:36] and not for any other
[16:39] because for him he gets the broken
[16:40] [music] thing
[16:43] and again he molds it and makes [music]
[16:45] it new.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think we can sing with more
[16:50] meaning now. [music]
[16:54] So Lord, [singing] if I'm going to
[16:57] [music] be broken,
[17:00] oh, I'll rather [singing] be broken for
[17:03] you.
[17:06] Cuz [music] you have a way of taking
[17:09] [singing] broken beings and making
[17:12] [music]
[17:12] them just [singing] like new.
[17:17] Lord, I don't mind [music and singing]
[17:20] the pain.
[17:23] Do all you must [music] do.
[17:27] Oh, take me and [singing] break me and
[17:31] make me just like [music] you.
[17:36] Amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, [music]
[17:48] &gt;&gt; do you want to be broken for him?
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, our time is going fast.
[17:56] [music]
[17:58] I just want us to get on our feet.
[18:02] You can give [music] me that song. I am
[18:04] going to a city
[18:08] where the streets with gold are laid,
[18:13] where the tree of life is blooming

[28:43] more than anything [music]
[28:46] in my life.

[28:54] More than wealth,
[28:57] fame, all desires,

[29:06] More than anything
[29:09] in my life, I've got [singing] to make

[30:19] in my life I've got [music] to make it.
[30:24] What good is all I've come to know? What
[30:27] good [singing] is all I've come [music]
[30:30] to know if I gain this world and lose
[30:36] [music]

[30:42] in my life.

[45:38] Sweet
[45:40] spirit,
[45:43] sweetheart. [music]
[45:52] Precious heavenly father,
[45:56] our rest will be complete
[45:59] when we are seated at your feet this
[46:01] morning.
[46:03] We invite you in this service
[46:06] that you may be present with us
[46:10] to teach us the things that be of
[46:14] eternal life.
[46:16] I want to thank you, Father,
[46:19] for the things you've done for us
[46:21] [music]
[46:22] through the time since we last were
[46:26] together
[46:28] on Wednesday.
[46:30] Here we are present again. [music]
[46:33] We seek for your grace. We seek for your
[46:36] love. [music]
[46:38] seek for instructions,
[46:40] Lord, that we may not be found
[46:44] deficient [music] of your goodness.
[46:47] We commit everybody to your hands and
[46:50] their needs, [music]
[46:52] father, that you may supply
[46:55] in Jesus name. [music]
[46:57] Amen. Amen. We give the Lord a hand of
[46:59] praise. [applause]
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] So just turn around and shake your
[47:08] brother's hand.
[47:10] Welcome one another to the service.
[47:14] Praise the Lord. Welcome one another to
[47:17] the service.
[47:20] Amen. Amen. And see the goodness of the
[47:23] Lord
[47:24] in this service. Amen. Amen. So we shall
[47:29] turn together
[47:31] to the book
[47:34] uh of Matthew chapter 11
[47:38] and verse 28.
[47:42] 1128.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[47:51] heavy laden and I'll give you rest.
[48:01] May the Lord had bless in the reading of
[48:03] his word.
[48:06] You may be seated.
[48:10] So the scripture here says
[48:13] we should go unto him
[48:16] those of us that labor
[48:20] and
[48:22] laden
[48:23] and he'll give us rest.
[48:27] You see that's a very great invitation
[48:31] when he says come unto me.
[48:34] We cannot go to any other better place
[48:39] but unto him if we are looking for rest.
[48:44] So this morning
[48:46] I want to speak on the subject of the
[48:48] rest.
[48:51] You know sometimes when you wake up in
[48:53] the morning
[48:56] And then you go into your labors
[49:00] by evening you are so exhausted
[49:04] you need some rest.
[49:06] Rest is very important
[49:11] for a person that's working.
[49:14] Amen. Amen. So he says come unto me.
[49:20] Look come unto me.
[49:23] It involves a space
[49:27] between you
[49:29] and the person calling you.
[49:32] Amen. Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; So I'm calling you from labor.
[49:37] Because where you are, you labor. Where
[49:41] I am, you rest. You stay there. You stay
[49:46] in labor. You come after me. You come to
[49:49] rest. You understand now? So he says
[49:53] turn around
[49:55] and walk back
[49:58] into the rest here. There is a journey
[50:01] to cover in between here.
[50:05] So but this rest
[50:07] is demonstrated by Paul
[50:10] in Hebrews chapter 4. Let's go to
[50:13] Hebrews chapter 4.
[50:16] How many of you need to rest?
[50:19] Yeah, you need to give yourself rest.
[50:23] Amen. In some of these natural things,
[50:28] Amen. You feel like you've labored a lot
[50:30] and you need to rest.
[50:33] He says in 410,
[50:37] "For he that is entered into his rest,
[50:44] not your rest,
[50:47] but his rest."
[50:51] Amen. Amen. So we come from all our
[50:53] labors
[50:56] and we enter into his rest.
[51:00] He also has ceased from his own works
[51:05] as God did from his.
[51:10] When we go to him and find rest,
[51:14] then we cease from our works.
[51:17] Like when God entered his rest on the
[51:20] Sabbath,
[51:22] he also seized from his labor.
[51:27] Amen. Amen. So we rest from our works,
[51:31] not his works,
[51:33] but from our own works.
[51:37] So we enter his rest.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; And when we enter into his rest,
[51:44] we rest from our sinful works.
[51:51] Amen. Amen. And we also rest
[51:54] from what we think we can do to please
[51:57] God.
[52:01] There are two things here. He's calling
[52:03] you unto himself.
[52:06] When you come to him, you have come to
[52:09] righteousness.
[52:11] Are you together with me? That means you
[52:15] seize from the life of sin
[52:19] and you enter into a life of
[52:21] righteousness.
[52:25] And again once you entered his
[52:27] righteousness,
[52:29] then you have seized
[52:33] into laboring in such a way
[52:37] that you may be able to please God.
[52:41] Amen. Amen. So we cease from our own
[52:44] works
[52:47] that Christ may begin his works in us.
[52:53] Are you together with me? Your sins from
[52:55] yours
[52:57] that Christ may begin his works.
[53:01] Okay? That's what we call walking in
[53:04] Christ
[53:07] or walking with Christ.
[53:10] We ought to be born of him,
[53:14] filled with him
[53:16] and walking with him
[53:18] by his word.
[53:21] That way you have come to a rest.
[53:24] Amen. So let us look at Romans chapter 8
[53:29] and verse one. He says
[53:33] &gt;&gt; there is
[53:35] therefore now no condemnation
[53:44] to them which are in Christ
[53:49] who walk not after the flesh
[53:52] but after the spirit.
[53:59] meaning that they've entered into the
[54:01] rest.
[54:04] So they raised from their sinful works.
[54:10] There is therefore no condemnation unto
[54:12] them
[54:15] because they are in Christ
[54:18] and they don't walk by the flesh to
[54:20] labor
[54:24] but they walk by the spirit
[54:27] which is our rest.
[54:30] So walking in the flesh,
[54:33] I said one labors in two ways.
[54:38] One labors under the unconverted sinful
[54:42] nature
[54:46] and oneself was trying to work out the
[54:49] works of righteousness.
[54:54] Verse two here
[54:56] for the law of the spirit of life in
[54:59] Christ Jesus.
[55:03] has made me free
[55:06] from the law of sin and death.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; The law of the spirit now
[55:18] of life in Christ
[55:22] makes us free from the law of sin and
[55:25] death.
[55:30] So this rest I'm talking about
[55:34] is when one is not under the law of sin
[55:38] and death.
[55:42] Amen. Then we call therefore you know we
[55:48] are called therefore from our works
[55:52] into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[55:56] Well, that's where the rest is.
[56:00] The rest is in the baptism.
[56:04] The baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[56:07] Are you together with me? That's where
[56:10] the rest is.
[56:12] You entered the Holy Spirit
[56:15] and once you entered the Holy Spirit,
[56:18] then you have rested from your works.
[56:22] Amen.
[56:23] Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Now
[56:28] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here
[56:31] that the call from your work
[56:35] is the beginning
[56:38] of your rest
[56:40] and that rest
[56:42] is the work of the Holy Spirit in you.
[56:48] Now you seize from the law of sin and
[56:51] death
[56:54] and then the law of Christ
[56:57] begins to rule in you.
[57:01] Are you together with me? Okay. So now
[57:05] in Isaiah chapter 20
[57:08] we can look at the definition 28. Isaiah
[57:12] 28
[57:15] we can look at the definition.
[57:18] of uh of uh of rest
[57:24] 28:10
[57:26] I'm taking time to lay the foundation
[57:31] you know Isaiah said
[57:34] for precept must be upon precept
[57:45] precept upon upon precept,
[57:50] line upon line,
[57:53] line upon line,
[57:56] here a little and there a little
[58:01] is talking about the precepts
[58:05] of the word.
[58:08] That's where we start from.
[58:12] The word goes ahead.
[58:17] to bring this rest
[58:20] because it must be precept upon precept.
[58:26] The word must call you into this rest.
[58:32] Come unto me.
[58:34] The word is calling you. It doesn't call
[58:38] you to harder labor.
[58:42] It calls you to the rest.
[58:45] You rest from your own works
[58:48] and then Christ begins his work in you.
[58:53] Amen. Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Verse 11 he says for with stmering lips
[59:01] and another tongue
[59:04] will he speak to his people.
[59:16] to whom he said.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; This is the rest
[59:24] wherewith ye may cause the word to rest.
[59:31] And this is the refreshing
[59:35] yet they could not hear.
[59:39] Amen. When he was here on earth,
[59:43] he called men
[59:45] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Come follow me,
[59:49] come unto me all YE WHO LABOR THAT I
[59:54] will give you rest."
[59:57] Praise the Lord. And those that came
[1:00:00] unto him,
[1:00:02] he took them into the upper room
[1:00:05] on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:08] and spoke by them
[1:00:11] from strange language.
[1:00:15] And he says, "This Pentecost here
[1:00:19] is your Sabbath,
[1:00:22] is your rest."
[1:00:25] He says, "But they didn't understand.
[1:00:28] They just continue
[1:00:30] desiring to observe the Sabbath day.
[1:00:35] But when Jesus entered into his I mean
[1:00:38] when God entered into his rest,
[1:00:42] he could not go back to work again.
[1:00:45] Amen. But under the law, because it was
[1:00:50] a shadow, they would go in on the
[1:00:54] Sabbath day and come out again, work the
[1:00:58] six days and go back in there. But in
[1:01:02] the New Testament, Jesus says that's not
[1:01:05] what's going to happen.
[1:01:07] THE BAPTISM OF THE Holy Spirit is going
[1:01:10] to be your rest.
[1:01:13] And once you enter into that rest,
[1:01:16] hallelujah, you seize from your words.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. The Holy Spirit works
[1:01:24] for the effect that he may seal you in.
[1:01:30] Amen. So Pentecost
[1:01:33] was the rest
[1:01:35] to the men that had toiled under the law
[1:01:38] in the Old Testament.
[1:01:44] Amen. Because the law
[1:01:47] was labor.
[1:01:50] Amen. They labored.
[1:01:53] They had to fulfill something.
[1:01:57] Amen. But he saw them in the law.
[1:02:01] Then he says, "Come unto me now
[1:02:04] because you are a distance away
[1:02:07] and you must come
[1:02:10] by way of justification,
[1:02:13] sanctification
[1:02:14] and the gospel of the Holy Spirit."
[1:02:17] Amen. Amen. So Paul asked the believers
[1:02:22] in the upper coast of Ephesus
[1:02:25] whether they had received the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] when they believed.
[1:02:34] Because when you believe,
[1:02:37] you are called to rest.
[1:02:41] You are called to the person of the Holy
[1:02:43] Spirit.
[1:02:46] That's why we are called
[1:02:48] We are not called to continue in labor.
[1:02:53] We are called to enter into his rest.
[1:02:58] The rest will be Christ in you of glory.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? You cease from
[1:03:09] the law of sin and death
[1:03:12] and the LAW OF CHRIST
[1:03:15] BEGINS TO work by you.
[1:03:18] through the bas of the Holy Spirit, he
[1:03:21] begins to give you instructions.
[1:03:24] He begins to teach you when you error,
[1:03:26] he rebukes you simply because he loves
[1:03:30] you. He called you to rest.
[1:03:35] Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So true conversion
[1:03:40] must lead you to rest.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is after we had come to the
[1:03:48] call
[1:03:50] of Matthew 11:28
[1:03:54] that we could start
[1:03:56] on the distance
[1:03:58] to enter and remain
[1:04:02] in the rest according to Hebrews 4:11.
[1:04:08] Amen. Amen. We are called and then we
[1:04:12] begin a distance.
[1:04:15] Amen. To enter into the rest and remain
[1:04:20] in it.
[1:04:23] You don't enter and come out.
[1:04:26] You enter and remain.
[1:04:28] So Hebrews 4:11
[1:04:32] is the seal. Therefore,
[1:04:35] seal till the day of redemption.
[1:04:38] We know that scripture.
[1:04:40] Amen. Amen. Hebrews 4:11.
[1:04:46] Praise the Lord. Are you together with
[1:04:48] me? You were not called to keep shaking
[1:04:52] yourself around
[1:04:56] trying to say, "Am I making it or I will
[1:04:58] not make it?"
[1:05:02] The enemy will always try to convert
[1:05:05] your look
[1:05:09] from the promise
[1:05:11] to this thing here.
[1:05:17] You see from 10.
[1:05:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:22] He says, "For he that is entered into
[1:05:24] his rest,
[1:05:27] he has also seized from his own works
[1:05:31] as God did from his
[1:05:35] verse 11." Now 11, he says, "Let us
[1:05:39] therefore labor therefore to enter into
[1:05:42] that rest."
[1:05:47] Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; We are going to be able to reconcile
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Matthew 11:28
[1:06:02] and Hebrews 4:11.
[1:06:06] Now, Matthew 11:28,
[1:06:11] he says, "Come unto me, all you who
[1:06:14] labor and are laden, and I'll give you
[1:06:18] rest." But Hebrews 4:11,
[1:06:22] he's saying, "Labor to enter."
[1:06:28] So, we we want to reconcile those two
[1:06:31] scriptures.
[1:06:34] Now, brother Brham says,
[1:06:37] you know, Peter said,
[1:06:39] "Repent
[1:06:41] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ
[1:06:45] for the remission of sins, and you shall
[1:06:48] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:51] You begin by believing.
[1:06:54] You are justified.
[1:06:56] You are baptized.
[1:06:58] You are sanctified. You are baptized
[1:07:01] with the HOLY GHOST.
[1:07:03] NOW PAUL ASKED the believers in those
[1:07:06] parts of Ephesus,
[1:07:09] "Have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] since you believe?"
[1:07:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLED COME to me
[1:07:20] and you accept.
[1:07:22] You believe and you walk yourself
[1:07:26] into the rest which is the bapt of the
[1:07:29] HOLY GHOST.
[1:07:31] SO PAUL WAS ASKING THEM NOW THAT YOU
[1:07:35] TOOK the distance to come,
[1:07:38] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:07:44] Amen. So people repent of their sins.
[1:07:48] They get baptized in water, but they
[1:07:52] don't go on
[1:07:54] and receive the Holy Ghost. You believe
[1:07:58] unto receiving the spirit of
[1:08:03] Amen. You believe unto receiving the
[1:08:07] Holy Spirit.
[1:08:09] So the question according to Paul here.
[1:08:12] Why did you believe?
[1:08:15] You believe? So that you may receive the
[1:08:19] Holy Spirit.
[1:08:21] Hallelujah. SO EVERYBODY HERE WHO has
[1:08:25] believed is a candidate for the baptism
[1:08:29] of the Holy Spirit. You are called to
[1:08:32] enter your rest.
[1:08:34] There are no two things about it. You
[1:08:38] are called to enter THE REST. THAT'S WHY
[1:08:40] Paul says have you believed sins? I mean
[1:08:44] have you received sins?
[1:08:50] Amen. Believing on Jesus
[1:08:53] is the step in the right direction
[1:08:57] which is towards the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:00] But the people stop there. They go as as
[1:09:04] water baptism then stop.
[1:09:09] You don't have to stop there. You are
[1:09:12] still on A JOURNEY UNTIL YOU COME to the
[1:09:15] rest
[1:09:17] BECAUSE YOUR CALL
[1:09:19] WILL COME unto me and I will give you
[1:09:23] rest.
[1:09:25] Amen. So you don't stop in between
[1:09:27] there. WHEN YOU ARE JUSTIFIED,
[1:09:31] YOU ARE STILL WALKING. When you are san
[1:09:35] justified, you are still walking.
[1:09:38] When sanctification, you are still
[1:09:40] walking.
[1:09:41] And when you receive the bosom of the
[1:09:43] Holy Ghost,
[1:09:45] THEN THE door of eternal fellowship
[1:09:50] with God has opened.
[1:09:55] Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go to uh keep Matthew 11:29.
[1:10:02] We need to go all the way
[1:10:07] into taking the yoke
[1:10:11] to be YOLKED INTO FELLOWSHIP with
[1:10:14] Christ.
[1:10:17] Amen. Amen. So 11:28 says,
[1:10:22] "Come unto me all you
[1:10:26] have
[1:10:28] and I'll give you rest."
[1:10:30] 29 says,
[1:10:32] Take my yoke upon you
[1:10:36] and learn of me for I am meek and low in
[1:10:40] heart
[1:10:42] and you shall find rest unto your soul.
[1:10:49] Praise the Lord. I don't know some of
[1:10:52] you have been born in the cities
[1:10:56] and sometimes even natural things fail
[1:10:59] to teach us.
[1:11:02] Brother Brham said, your adoption,
[1:11:07] your your birth is not your adoption.
[1:11:13] An adopted son
[1:11:16] is a child who has got the ability
[1:11:21] to share in responsibility with the
[1:11:23] father.
[1:11:26] So this morning I was asking my daughter
[1:11:30] that you are expecting a baby.
[1:11:33] What if this baby is born
[1:11:35] and he say mommy
[1:11:38] call daddy here where are the titles of
[1:11:41] this land
[1:11:44] and the titles of this land?
[1:11:46] Which banks do you have the money?
[1:11:49] Which signature do you use?
[1:11:54] Because a child is born.
[1:11:57] But he cannot be adopted
[1:12:01] immediately at birth.
[1:12:04] He has to grow.
[1:12:07] As young as long as he's a child,
[1:12:11] he's like a servant.
[1:12:13] And even a servant knows more.
[1:12:19] Are you together with me? Yeah.
[1:12:21] Sometimes we need to learn from nature.
[1:12:25] So hear about the yoke,
[1:12:29] you know, I grew up
[1:12:31] uh on a farm
[1:12:35] and I grew up doing some things that the
[1:12:38] farm does
[1:12:41] to raise cattle
[1:12:43] and when I married my wife,
[1:12:46] the first thing we did was to plant,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. a full acre of tomatoes.
[1:12:56] I and my wife stayed in it.
[1:12:59] And after the time of end, time of
[1:13:01] reaping came,
[1:13:04] we could load a truck
[1:13:07] to bring to the market here
[1:13:09] and that's why we bought the first
[1:13:11] things we needed in life.
[1:13:15] We grew up driving tractors.
[1:13:18] But when a child I mean a cow
[1:13:23] is stubborn
[1:13:25] they get a yoke
[1:13:29] and tie it here.
[1:13:32] There are some of those cows
[1:13:34] which are very hard to look after.
[1:13:39] But the love of the father
[1:13:42] puts a yoke.
[1:13:44] Amen. on that cow. If he's starting to
[1:13:48] run,
[1:13:50] that log will keep building
[1:13:53] and it stops.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; He baptizes us
[1:14:00] and then places a yoke
[1:14:04] of his will.
[1:14:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Where we say no longer
[1:14:12] but YOUR WILL BE DONE.
[1:14:15] HE PLACES a yoke on you
[1:14:18] that you can be under control.
[1:14:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He says, "Take
[1:14:25] my yoke upon you
[1:14:29] and learn from me. For I am meek and low
[1:14:32] in heart.
[1:14:35] Because I was yucked to my father.
[1:14:39] He gave the y of obedience AND
[1:14:42] SUBMISSION.
[1:14:45] I DO NOTHING unless I see my father do.
[1:14:50] And once you get under this yoke,
[1:14:54] you find your rest.
[1:14:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; So put the labor of sin
[1:15:05] and our good works down.
[1:15:09] Then take the yoke upon you.
[1:15:13] Because the yoke
[1:15:15] led in it doing the will of the father
[1:15:20] gave him the grace
[1:15:22] to sanctify himself
[1:15:25] for our sex.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. THE YOKE YOKED
[1:15:30] HIM to the will of God.
[1:15:35] Not my will
[1:15:37] but your will be done. When the cross
[1:15:40] was STANDING BEFORE YOU.
[1:15:42] WHAT LOOKS BITTER,
[1:15:47] it was a joy to him.
[1:15:51] That's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:15:54] when he pushes the rest. You rest under
[1:15:58] the will of God for your life.
[1:16:02] Amen. So the yoke
[1:16:05] is the mind of the father
[1:16:09] in the son.
[1:16:11] Amen. Y to his will
[1:16:15] and you let this mind be you
[1:16:19] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the yoke.
[1:16:26] You wake up every morning
[1:16:28] on your phone. You get into the yoke.
[1:16:32] Your Bible. You get into the yoke. Your
[1:16:36] meditation.
[1:16:38] You get into your yoke.
[1:16:40] Amen. You are finding the will of God
[1:16:44] to guide you and to lead you.
[1:16:49] Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:16:54] The title of the message
[1:16:56] is finding rest.
[1:17:02] All of us
[1:17:04] have got a lot of things
[1:17:06] that weigh on you.
[1:17:10] You need to rest.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "For my yoke is easy
[1:17:19] and my burden is light."
[1:17:22] Amen. Amen. So your labors
[1:17:25] while you in the world of sin.
[1:17:28] They were grievous.
[1:17:31] But his yoke
[1:17:33] is light.
[1:17:36] The yoke of submission to the father.
[1:17:40] Your labor
[1:17:42] was your human investment.
[1:17:48] Sometimes to please the Lord,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; you labor,
[1:17:55] you invert which way can do to be
[1:17:57] righteous.
[1:18:01] But once you get baptized by the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost,
[1:18:05] he guides you
[1:18:07] in the word
[1:18:10] to catch his will
[1:18:12] and remain in the rest.
[1:18:15] Amen. Amen. So the Greek interpretation
[1:18:18] for labor
[1:18:22] in Matthew 11:28
[1:18:25] is the labor that wears you down.
[1:18:33] You are trying to do your best
[1:18:36] thinking by that you are pleasing the
[1:18:38] father
[1:18:40] but you get worn down.
[1:18:44] You fight the life of sin
[1:18:48] and you are laboring
[1:18:50] but you are wearing down.
[1:18:53] That's the labor that he was calling you
[1:18:56] for
[1:18:58] a burden.
[1:19:00] It means a load,
[1:19:03] a weight,
[1:19:05] the toil.
[1:19:08] That's what he was calling you out of.
[1:19:11] Now listen, he was calling them
[1:19:16] from the toil of the law.
[1:19:21] Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And the judgments of the law
[1:19:27] to bring them to rest in Christ
[1:19:31] by the bapt of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:34] And Pentecost was their rest.
[1:19:38] Pentecost is your rest.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; the law
[1:19:48] was holy,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; but man was not.
[1:19:55] And for him to handle the holy law,
[1:19:59] it was a burden.
[1:20:02] For man had fallen from the glory of God
[1:20:08] to fulfill that holy law.
[1:20:11] was a burden.
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And all his attempts to meet the demands
[1:20:17] of the law
[1:20:21] was defined by Christ as labor.
[1:20:26] Now listen here so that you can be able
[1:20:30] to catch what I mean.
[1:20:32] Before the fall,
[1:20:35] man did not operate under the burden
[1:20:41] of the law. I mean the burden of labor.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Because after creation,
[1:20:54] man stepped into God's rest.
[1:21:00] Are you together with me?
[1:21:02] Adam only walked out of it,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; but on creation,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; he entered into God's rest.
[1:21:14] Amen. Amen. Amen. So, Adam didn't
[1:21:17] understand labor before the fall.
[1:21:22] And this rest
[1:21:25] in the time was not the absence of work.
[1:21:31] Oh,
[1:21:34] no. Let me rest. I'm telling you.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about rest,
[1:21:38] I'm not telling YOU TO GO BACK HOME.
[1:21:45] The pastor preached that we should rest
[1:21:49] from our jobs. We should resign. And
[1:21:53] then you wake up in the morning,
[1:21:56] you sit home,
[1:21:58] you are opening this paper of the part
[1:22:01] of the newspaper.
[1:22:05] Husband, won't you work?
[1:22:08] You don't need revelation that came
[1:22:09] yesterday
[1:22:11] that we have to rest.
[1:22:15] Congratulating you, Sister Z.
[1:22:20] God bless you.
[1:22:21] You've labored and looks like you have
[1:22:24] found rest.
[1:22:27] Amen. So let me say this.
[1:22:31] The rest in the time of Adam
[1:22:35] was not the absence of work
[1:22:39] because Adam was restful
[1:22:44] and his work in the garden. Amen.
[1:22:55] He was working in his rest. The word
[1:22:57] labor
[1:22:59] was never known
[1:23:04] before the fall.
[1:23:06] Amen. Amen. The term knowledge labor
[1:23:10] came into use
[1:23:13] after sin came into humanity.
[1:23:17] Sin caused man to lose the rest
[1:23:22] to which rest
[1:23:25] GOD IS CALLING YOU BACK TO.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. And remember this rest is
[1:23:35] not the absence of work.
[1:23:38] The rest during the time of Adam
[1:23:42] was a man under divine leadership.
[1:23:48] Every evening
[1:23:50] God came,
[1:23:52] appreciated him and advised him how to
[1:23:56] go forward.
[1:23:58] Once you come into this rest,
[1:24:02] I want to tell you the Holy Spirit
[1:24:06] becomes your guide.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know the rest of Adam
[1:24:14] is a man subjected to the mind of the
[1:24:17] father.
[1:24:20] A man
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; as a divine instrumentality
[1:24:30] a man in THE HANDS OF GOD. Once you earn
[1:24:34] those kind of things you are in your
[1:24:37] rest.
[1:24:41] Now in the message fellowship of
[1:24:43] Minipolis,
[1:24:46] the prophet says a Christian experience
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; is blessed solemnly and holy upon rest.
[1:25:00] A true Christian must find rest.
[1:25:07] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:09] He says, "We are tossed about with
[1:25:11] everything
[1:25:14] until you come to Christ.
[1:25:17] Then it's all finished.
[1:25:21] Resting in Christ perfectly.
[1:25:27] WHEN CHRIST CALLS YOU
[1:25:30] AND you come to him, you are called
[1:25:33] because you must rest.
[1:25:37] And this rest here is the baptism of the
[1:25:41] Holy Spirit.
[1:25:43] Amen. Is no longer I
[1:25:47] but Christ that liveth in
[1:25:50] is now Christ in you. The hope of glory.
[1:25:54] It's now him saying, it is now him
[1:25:57] saying
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; that Christ me
[1:26:01] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:26:06] You raise FROM THE LAW OF SIN and death
[1:26:11] to the leadership of the law of the
[1:26:12] spirit.
[1:26:16] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Adam's rest
[1:26:20] was a sublime condition.
[1:26:27] but not the absence of work.
[1:26:32] So the rest I'm talking about
[1:26:35] which Adam was in
[1:26:38] was a rest
[1:26:40] where Adam did everything he had to do
[1:26:44] and leper
[1:26:48] listen Identified masterpiece of God
[1:26:54] He says, "Now,
[1:26:56] and when he made man,
[1:26:58] that first man, how perfect it was.
[1:27:03] He looked like a god.
[1:27:08] God the great Holy Spirit
[1:27:11] roaming over the earth
[1:27:13] and the birds
[1:27:16] come out maybe and the animals
[1:27:20] different things and kept COMING
[1:27:24] MORE in the form of the one that was
[1:27:28] brooding.
[1:27:32] Amen. until finally
[1:27:35] there came up a species.
[1:27:40] Amen. A specy
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; just exactly like the one
[1:27:47] that was doing the brooming.
[1:27:50] Are you together with me? And a little
[1:27:53] lower in that paragraph,
[1:27:57] brother says, "What a complete satis sat
[1:28:02] I mean sat satisfaction
[1:28:06] it was to God
[1:28:09] till
[1:28:11] even he rested."
[1:28:16] Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:28:20] "It is finished now." Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; After bringing forth his image,
[1:28:27] he entered into his rest
[1:28:30] because his work had been finished.
[1:28:34] And this rest was a sublime condition,
[1:28:38] as I said,
[1:28:42] which man lost
[1:28:45] by sin.
[1:28:47] and he cannot work himself back into
[1:28:51] that rest.
[1:28:55] Are you together with me? This is a
[1:28:57] supernatural condition.
[1:29:00] YOU don't walk into IT BY the law. THEY
[1:29:04] STARTED TO LABOR.
[1:29:07] THEY WANTED to walk back into that rest.
[1:29:10] THEY WANTED TO GO BACK INTO THAT
[1:29:12] CONDITION.
[1:29:14] Nothing you can do for you to walk back
[1:29:17] into that.
[1:29:19] THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, NO man can come
[1:29:23] to me except my father.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. WE WANT THANK GOD THIS
[1:29:34] morning
[1:29:36] because he's bringing us back into his
[1:29:38] rest.
[1:29:40] It's only grace
[1:29:43] that puts us back in that race. Grace
[1:29:47] has a sound
[1:29:50] AS A VOICE.
[1:29:52] COME unto me. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:29:56] voice of grace.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; After the fall,
[1:30:02] then came the toils.
[1:30:09] after the fall.
[1:30:11] THAT'S WHEN HE SAYS, "I'll greatly
[1:30:14] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception.
[1:30:28] Tomorrow thou shalt bring forth children
[1:30:32] and thy desire shall be after thy
[1:30:34] husband.
[1:30:37] He shall rule over you.
[1:30:40] The war picture is now changed.
[1:30:45] Why? Because of the fall. Then labor
[1:30:49] comes.
[1:30:51] I don't want to go in those labor w
[1:30:57] my son-in-law here
[1:31:01] walks in there with his wife
[1:31:04] anyway because that's his work
[1:31:08] but they in labor
[1:31:12] to bring life.
[1:31:16] the word labor was not there.
[1:31:20] Now in Genesis 3:18,
[1:31:24] we find out that the word to labor
[1:31:28] in the spiritual aspect
[1:31:31] and in the natural aspect
[1:31:34] comes in after the fall.
[1:31:38] And they stay in that condition
[1:31:42] until Christ himself COMES
[1:31:45] REVERSE that condition.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Christ must come your way.
[1:31:53] That condition.
[1:31:55] So this morning he says come unto me. If
[1:32:00] you feel you in labor,
[1:32:02] YOU ARE IN YOUR STRUGGLES AND YOU NEED
[1:32:05] GOD, come unto me.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And I'll give you rest. When you rest in
[1:32:12] your spirit
[1:32:14] by the new birth in your entire life
[1:32:19] is properly affected in a divine manner.
[1:32:26] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:29] So he says in Genesis 3:18,
[1:32:33] "Fs also,
[1:32:36] and so shall it bring forth to thee,
[1:32:41] and thou shalt eat of the her of the
[1:32:44] field,
[1:32:47] and in the sweat of thy face
[1:32:52] shalt thou eat bread,
[1:32:56] till thou return unto the ground.
[1:33:00] For out of the ground
[1:33:03] it was taken
[1:33:06] for dust thou art
[1:33:10] and unto dust thou shalt return.
[1:33:16] Are you together with me? Labor
[1:33:20] had not been known
[1:33:24] till after the fall.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; labor to bring forth life,
[1:33:32] labor in our families.
[1:33:35] Because when Adam got Eve,
[1:33:39] she was supposed to be a help.
[1:33:42] She was supposed to be a joy
[1:33:45] in the family with the husband. that all
[1:33:48] these things we have is a result of sin
[1:33:53] that we labor
[1:33:55] to stay together as husband of God.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; It's not holiness which causes that.
[1:34:04] It's the nature of sin.
[1:34:09] That's right.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Do you hear what I'm saying?
[1:34:12] There is labor in the families,
[1:34:15] labor in divine service,
[1:34:19] AMEN. AMEN. YOU KNOW when you are trying
[1:34:21] to be a a a minister
[1:34:26] and you labor,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO FULFILL SOMETHING.
[1:34:32] Are you together with me? Labor in our
[1:34:35] jobs.
[1:34:38] My my my
[1:34:40] praise the Lord. I'VE EVEN TOLD YOU
[1:34:43] LABOR six days.
[1:34:46] [laughter]
[1:34:48] Now everything labors
[1:34:52] and brother Brham says
[1:34:55] as a woman traileth
[1:35:00] all creation is travailing.
[1:35:07] Nature is prevailing.
[1:35:10] It doesn't experience that sense of
[1:35:12] rest.
[1:35:16] It's a travailing.
[1:35:18] What's all this groaning are travailing
[1:35:20] about?
[1:35:23] Like a woman that's to be a mother
[1:35:28] is trying to bring forth life
[1:35:32] upon the earth again like it was before
[1:35:35] the flood.
[1:35:38] Amen. So nature is crying
[1:35:43] for the new birth, the return of the
[1:35:46] lost rest.
[1:35:51] The sons of God
[1:35:53] lost the rest
[1:35:56] and subjected all nature
[1:35:59] and labor.
[1:36:01] And this rest must come. Amen. By the
[1:36:06] sons
[1:36:08] that lost it.
[1:36:12] That's why ROMANS 8,
[1:36:15] ALL nature
[1:36:17] is crying FOR THE ADOPTION.
[1:36:20] THE SONS OF GOD
[1:36:22] WITH THE SONS of God,
[1:36:25] NOT SONS OF CAIN, THE SONS OF GOD. A
[1:36:30] SPECIAL WORLD.
[1:36:36] When will THEY
[1:36:39] COME BACK into their positions again?
[1:36:47] This rest
[1:36:49] generally speaking
[1:36:52] must be brought back
[1:36:55] by those that lost it.
[1:37:02] The sun, I mean, nature is crying.
[1:37:06] Where are the sons of God?
[1:37:09] Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You see, you just go and start cutting a
[1:37:14] tree
[1:37:17] for no good reason.
[1:37:21] You throw it down
[1:37:23] and after it doesn't have life,
[1:37:27] but it cries as your cat.
[1:37:33] We are the sons of God.
[1:37:39] [laughter]
[1:37:40] Are you together with me? This is where
[1:37:43] we are.
[1:37:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; So there will be a return
[1:37:49] of the Eden of beauty
[1:37:52] and that will be the ultimate rest.
[1:37:58] That's why the scripture says
[1:38:01] There remainth a rest
[1:38:05] for the people of God.
[1:38:08] Amen. There remain A REST
[1:38:12] MUCH AS THEY'VE GOT THE BAS OF THE HOLY
[1:38:14] SPIRIT.
[1:38:17] They remain as
[1:38:19] we
[1:38:23] shall be in total rest.
[1:38:28] Amen.
[1:38:30] Praise God.
[1:38:32] Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; So man and the earth
[1:38:38] will be restored
[1:38:40] like it was before the fall.
[1:38:44] We look forward to when the earth will
[1:38:48] be again watered from the the ground.
[1:38:54] Amen. A mist from the earth.
[1:38:59] Amen. Praise God. Just trying to look at
[1:39:03] that millennium.
[1:39:07] Amen. We are entering into that rest
[1:39:12] the rest of 1,000 years.
[1:39:15] Amen. And God will show us what it was
[1:39:21] that Adam lost before he takes us over
[1:39:25] to the new Jerusalem
[1:39:27] to the new earth. Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Once again,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; there will be a return of rest.
[1:39:42] Amen. Amen. And in that land once again
[1:39:47] there will be the tree of life
[1:39:50] bearing 12 manners of fruit.
[1:39:54] And he would have fruit every month.
[1:39:58] And the leaves of the tree will be for
[1:40:01] the healing of the nations.
[1:40:04] But this time, there will be no tree of
[1:40:07] knowledge.
[1:40:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Because you shall have gone above the
[1:40:13] fall
[1:40:16] in YOUR RESURRECTION.
[1:40:19] ALL IN your rapture.
[1:40:21] Your body will be filtered of the human
[1:40:24] spirit.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. That can be lied to.
[1:40:32] So the devil
[1:40:34] will not be able to lie to you
[1:40:37] because he lies to the human spirit.
[1:40:41] He doesn't lie to the soul.
[1:40:44] Hallelujah. At that time we shall be
[1:40:49] body soul and
[1:40:55] we shall be wise
[1:40:57] precept UPON PRECEPT
[1:41:00] upon land product of the world. We
[1:41:03] cannot be deceiveable.
[1:41:07] Amen. Amen. Yes sir. There is coming the
[1:41:12] millennium rest.
[1:41:15] And then the new Jerusalem
[1:41:17] where there will be no labor
[1:41:20] we shall literally enter his rest
[1:41:24] and this time never to part.
[1:41:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; So God is restoring the rest
[1:41:34] and finally
[1:41:36] walk into it.
[1:41:38] Amen. Amen. Let us deal with labor a
[1:41:40] little bit.
[1:41:43] Today man is surrounded by labor.
[1:41:50] You labor in many things.
[1:41:53] A sister wrote me
[1:41:55] and said remember me in prayer.
[1:41:58] I'm find difficult to breathe.
[1:42:02] It's labor
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; and have congested chest.
[1:42:09] You see all those elements of labor,
[1:42:13] all of you here, you labor to earn a
[1:42:16] living,
[1:42:19] you labor to sustain your families.
[1:42:22] And to an extent, you labor to live a
[1:42:25] Christian life.
[1:42:29] That's what God is calling us out of.
[1:42:33] And when God spoke about man's works in
[1:42:36] the law of Moses,
[1:42:39] he called it labor.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether you are a
[1:42:44] billionaire,
[1:42:47] you labor. That's right. If you are
[1:42:50] poor,
[1:42:51] you labor because that's the nature of
[1:42:54] life
[1:42:57] after the fall.
[1:43:00] Now,
[1:43:02] Exodus 20:9,
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; he says, "Six days
[1:43:08] shalt thou labor."
[1:43:13] Six days
[1:43:16] you should labor.
[1:43:18] And usually the law of Moses
[1:43:21] was based on labor.
[1:43:27] And in labor,
[1:43:29] the wickedness of man
[1:43:32] was exposed
[1:43:36] because labor
[1:43:39] is exhausted. Amen.
[1:43:42] Amen.
[1:43:47] The law of Moses
[1:43:49] was based on labor.
[1:43:52] Do this. Do this. Do this. There was no
[1:43:57] God in it.
[1:44:01] It was just the law given to you
[1:44:05] and do the law.
[1:44:08] The law which was holy
[1:44:11] but man was not.
[1:44:18] Do you love him? Amen. Amen. Romans
[1:44:21] chapter 7 verse 5
[1:44:26] Paul says for when we were in the flesh
[1:44:32] Paul is speaking about his past
[1:44:37] is not talking about his present.
[1:44:42] He's talking about when he was still in
[1:44:45] the Old Testament
[1:44:49] because the New Testament
[1:44:52] is in the blood. Any man WHO DOES NOT
[1:44:56] HAVE THE New Testament blood upon his
[1:44:58] soul
[1:45:02] is still under the labor of the Lord.
[1:45:08] That's right. So Paul
[1:45:11] is saying for when you were in the
[1:45:12] flesh,
[1:45:15] meaning before the new birth,
[1:45:19] listen to what he says, the motions of
[1:45:22] sin.
[1:45:25] Amen.
[1:45:27] Which were by the law,
[1:45:31] did work in our members,
[1:45:35] to bring forth fruit unto death,
[1:45:39] Paul is testifying to the Romans
[1:45:43] about how the law
[1:45:45] could not bring righteousness,
[1:45:48] but rather activated the motions of sin
[1:45:59] that the sin was boiling in me.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; As long as you know
[1:46:08] that THE LAW SAYS THOU SHALT not
[1:46:13] then the battle begins
[1:46:16] human nature will tell you try
[1:46:20] that's where the law begins from
[1:46:25] [laughter]
[1:46:25] and he says the more I knew the law
[1:46:29] is the more the motions of sin
[1:46:40] That's labor.
[1:46:42] Amen. Amen. Verse six.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW
[1:46:48] we are delivered from the law
[1:46:52] that being dead wherein we were held
[1:47:00] that we should serve in newness of
[1:47:03] spirit.
[1:47:07] Not in the oldness of the letter.
[1:47:12] Hallelujah.
[1:47:13] Amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; You see the letter in ITSELF
[1:47:19] without the spirit behind it
[1:47:22] is dead.
[1:47:26] It doesn't matter how many message books
[1:47:29] you read.
[1:47:32] The Holy Spirit has not called you into
[1:47:34] his rest.
[1:47:38] There is nothing to give what you know
[1:47:40] life.
[1:47:43] So the Holy Spirit
[1:47:45] MUST BE BEHIND OUR standing
[1:47:49] for the word to work in our lives.
[1:47:52] SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR me to
[1:47:55] know I'm called to the baptism of the
[1:47:58] Holy Spirit.
[1:48:01] Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament,
[1:48:06] it was service by the letter.
[1:48:10] But in the NEW TESTAMENT,
[1:48:12] IT SERVES by the newness of spirit
[1:48:16] is the new birth.
[1:48:18] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:48:25] Verse seven.
[1:48:27] WHAT shall we say then?
[1:48:30] Is the law sin?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[1:48:37] I had not known sin,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; but by the law,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; for I had not known last,
[1:48:50] except the law had said,
[1:48:54] "Thou shalt not cover.
[1:48:57] Yes.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; So the MORE
[1:49:02] knew the law
[1:49:04] without the new life of the person of
[1:49:06] the Holy Ghost
[1:49:09] is the more of commotion his spirit went
[1:49:12] to.
[1:49:16] Amen. Amen. So the law that was holy
[1:49:20] could not produce righteousness
[1:49:23] because man was weak in the will to
[1:49:27] perform.
[1:49:30] It takes the new birth.
[1:49:36] Amen. So each time man tried,
[1:49:41] he failed.
[1:49:43] And Christ
[1:49:45] called it labor.
[1:49:49] It was exhausting.
[1:49:52] Their human spirit was under bondage.
[1:49:57] The will was there.
[1:50:00] That's the power to perform.
[1:50:04] And that's why Christ called them to
[1:50:07] himself
[1:50:08] to empower them by the law of the
[1:50:12] spirit.
[1:50:15] Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; So you have toiled and failed.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE SAYS, "COME UNTO ME."
[1:50:25] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Those that are
[1:50:27] conscious
[1:50:29] that I am failing
[1:50:32] don't hide and anything
[1:50:35] come unto me. He's calling you now.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Don't try to HIDE
[1:50:42] WHEN THE motions of sin
[1:50:45] is boiling within.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:49] In the garbage cans of sin,
[1:50:52] in the bus.
[1:50:55] You toilet in the shrines.
[1:50:58] You have labored with everything.
[1:51:01] You come in and then go out.
[1:51:05] You stand and fall again.
[1:51:07] That's the man God wants to talk.
[1:51:11] And he says, "Come unto me."
[1:51:14] Amen. Hallelujah. You seem like you want
[1:51:17] to give up,
[1:51:19] BUT THE CALL
[1:51:21] IS COME unto me.
[1:51:25] Amen.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, now
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; let's get into this message here.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; What's that in your hand?
[1:51:38] The prophet says, "When the law was
[1:51:41] given Moses,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; he came down
[1:51:48] and struck the rock that was in his
[1:51:50] hand,
[1:51:52] and threw it down, and broke the
[1:51:55] commandment
[1:51:56] on because of wickedness
[1:51:59] which he had which was temper."
[1:52:04] Let's stop there.
[1:52:06] The temper
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; broke the law.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; I don't think it is temper with you.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; What's there
[1:52:20] that breaks the word?
[1:52:25] You know, that's where Christ wants to
[1:52:27] come to.
[1:52:30] What's there
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; that stops you from coming
[1:52:36] into the presence of the Lord?
[1:52:40] Before Adam sinned,
[1:52:43] he was always coming into his presence.
[1:52:47] After the fall, he hid.
[1:52:52] It's not that he didn't have ex Jesus.
[1:52:56] He had ex Jesus. We always have excuses
[1:53:01] when there is something that bothers us.
[1:53:06] Listen. And he broke the commandments
[1:53:10] and he went back showing that priesthood
[1:53:16] Levitical priesthood
[1:53:19] would be broken.
[1:53:22] But when Jesus was in the wilderness
[1:53:25] for 40 days,
[1:53:28] Satan tempted him at his weak spot.
[1:53:33] Hunger.
[1:53:36] That's where he comes to.
[1:53:39] He'll never come to you
[1:53:42] with an alcohol bottle.
[1:53:45] If you never drunk,
[1:53:50] he'll never come to you
[1:53:52] with a cigarette.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; If you never smoked,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; he always comes
[1:54:00] to strike the weak spot.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; And because you are not falling at that
[1:54:08] spot
[1:54:10] where that brother's fallen,
[1:54:13] it doesn't mean you are safe.
[1:54:17] Yeah,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; that weak spot
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; and he knows
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; how to do that tent
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and then he lowers his gun
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and then he says, "I got it."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; BUT IN CHRIST,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Satan found out
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; that there was something
[1:54:48] more than what Moses had.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Trying the devil will try you
[1:54:59] on your weak spot. But there is
[1:55:01] something in you that is greater than
[1:55:04] what Moses had.
[1:55:07] THAT'S THE BAS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT that
[1:55:10] you have been called to.
[1:55:13] Amen. Christ in you.
[1:55:16] Christ in you. The hope of glory being
[1:55:20] the gatekeeper
[1:55:23] to the SOUL
[1:55:26] that is greater than what Moses had.
[1:55:32] Hallelujah.
[1:55:33] It is Christ who is our life
[1:55:37] that will fight to victory every
[1:55:41] temptation that comes your way as if you
[1:55:43] have come to the res.
[1:55:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; So Paul says
[1:55:52] is God
[1:55:54] which workketh in you
[1:55:57] both to will and to do of his good
[1:56:00] pleasure.
[1:56:02] that is greater than Moses.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Christ in you,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; So under the law,
[1:56:15] man's labor
[1:56:17] was central to his righteousness.
[1:56:27] He uses his own works of righteousness
[1:56:29] to get righteousness. under the new
[1:56:32] testament
[1:56:34] which is the blood
[1:56:36] man
[1:56:38] is called to rest.
[1:56:43] So by saying come unto me.
[1:56:47] He's calling you to the word
[1:56:51] precept upon precept
[1:56:54] and then lead you over into your
[1:56:57] justification.
[1:57:00] still under precept upon precept
[1:57:04] and then gets you into sanctification
[1:57:08] which is still precept upon precept
[1:57:12] and again the bosom of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:15] which is still precept upon precept.
[1:57:18] So the rest is God calling you to
[1:57:24] receive the life in the precept.
[1:57:29] Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; We got to come to the word.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; No matter what the sensation is,
[1:57:37] what it looks like, how big the church
[1:57:40] is, how might the people are, you got to
[1:57:44] come back to the word of God.
[1:57:47] That's the prophet saying.
[1:57:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. We come back to the
[1:57:53] word
[1:57:54] to find rest.
[1:57:57] Amen.
[1:57:59] Come unto me
[1:58:02] all you who labor
[1:58:05] your trips.
[1:58:09] Come unto me
[1:58:12] precept upon precept
[1:58:14] line upon line here.
[1:58:19] Come unto me the word.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why he says
[1:58:30] obedience to the word entitles you to
[1:58:33] the talking.
[1:58:36] Amen. Therefore, he calls you into some
[1:58:40] of these areas.
[1:58:42] He begins with you by saying,
[1:58:45] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:58:49] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:58:52] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:58:54] the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:57] This is where we all began.
[1:59:00] Amen. Amen. And then it comes to many
[1:59:03] different areas
[1:59:05] after we have coming
[1:59:08] through the waterway.
[1:59:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then he says, but I
[1:59:14] suffer not a woman to teach
[1:59:18] not to accept authority over the man,
[1:59:22] but to be in silence.
[1:59:24] That's also part of the precept.
[1:59:28] And then he says, "Husbands,
[1:59:30] love your wife." This is a very soft
[1:59:33] spot. Now,
[1:59:35] husbands, you obligated
[1:59:39] to love your wives.
[1:59:41] And as Christ also loved the church, and
[1:59:45] gave himself for it,
[1:59:47] reception,
[1:59:49] ye wives, be subjection to your own
[1:59:52] husband. And if obey not the word
[1:59:57] be without the word
[2:00:00] be one by the conversation of the wives.
[2:00:05] Amen. That's also precept upon precept
[2:00:09] now through the sisters
[2:00:12] who adorn.
[2:00:16] Let it not be that outward.
[2:00:23] of plating hair
[2:00:26] and of wearing gold
[2:00:28] or putting on a prayer.
[2:00:31] That's precept upon precept.
[2:00:34] He's saying your beauty should not be in
[2:00:37] the hair you've made.
[2:00:39] He doesn't say you don't make the hair.
[2:00:43] But he says should not be in the hair
[2:00:46] that you care for. That's precept upon
[2:00:49] precept. But if a woman has long hair,
[2:00:53] It's a glory to her.
[2:00:56] Given
[2:00:57] for for for recovery
[2:01:01] precept upon priest, let us consider one
[2:01:05] another
[2:01:07] provoke unto love and good works.
[2:01:10] That's part of the world, not forsaking
[2:01:13] the assembling of ourselves.
[2:01:16] As the manner of some is,
[2:01:21] they miss a week come another
[2:01:25] to come another.
[2:01:28] Amen. But exing one another
[2:01:32] so much the more as you see the day
[2:01:36] approaching
[2:01:39] telling us that we should abstain
[2:01:43] from all appearances of evil.
[2:01:47] that the very God of peace
[2:01:50] might sanctify you. Holly
[2:01:53] Hallelujah. Soul, body, soul, and
[2:01:56] spirit.
[2:01:59] Amen. Fully sanctified.
[2:02:02] Your soul is sanctified.
[2:02:05] Fully filled with the word of faith.
[2:02:09] Amen. Your body is sanctified.
[2:02:14] Amen. set aside for holy service.
[2:02:18] Amen. IS NOT SHORT DRESS NO MORE.
[2:02:22] Sanctified body
[2:02:24] is not by this chex and star. This is a
[2:02:27] sanctified body.
[2:02:29] Hallelujah. Come out to me
[2:02:33] who labor he laden and I'll give you
[2:02:37] rest.
[2:02:38] That's a divine responsibility.
[2:02:42] Amen. Amen. in love
[2:02:45] with all that
[2:02:47] under the yoke
[2:02:50] of the law
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; So we can say like brother Brandham
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; listen here my eyes
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; is y
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; to Christ.
[2:03:11] That's your focus in life
[2:03:16] till I when I see this modern script on
[2:03:21] the street.
[2:03:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:39] He says, "My heart,
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; it turns my head, my heart is so yked
[2:03:50] in love to him
[2:03:53] till I can't have love for this world
[2:03:57] anymore.
[2:03:59] My will
[2:04:01] is so yoke to him.
[2:04:05] I don't even know
[2:04:07] what my ambitions are.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; So y
[2:04:15] amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet says when I turn and look at
[2:04:19] this strip tease.
[2:04:23] Amen. And then you said the men,
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; the men,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; even the women,
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; they look and copy,
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; copy and paste.
[2:04:42] Not so.
[2:04:46] He says, "My eyes are so yked.
[2:04:51] My focus is so limited.
[2:04:57] I fail to appreciate anything else
[2:05:02] that is not Christ.
[2:05:04] So we need to break the bond
[2:05:09] of the flesh and be bonded to the word
[2:05:14] and the word alone.
[2:05:16] So before the New Testament
[2:05:19] which is in the blood
[2:05:22] we labored
[2:05:26] you were not born
[2:05:28] in the New Testament
[2:05:30] but the new birth
[2:05:33] in the New Testament.
[2:05:35] Amen. Amen. So we labored to earn
[2:05:38] righteousness
[2:05:40] by the works of the law.
[2:05:44] We were not looking at transformation
[2:05:48] of the inner man.
[2:05:50] We were looking at the elements of sin.
[2:05:56] So when we looked at sin as elements,
[2:06:01] we failed.
[2:06:05] You said if I smoke it is sin.
[2:06:10] Drinking is sin.
[2:06:13] Adultery is a sin.
[2:06:16] So you labored with one element at a
[2:06:19] time.
[2:06:22] But we must know that sin is a nature
[2:06:27] that Christ came to call us out.
[2:06:32] Come unto me.
[2:06:35] And once you come to him
[2:06:37] and the nature changes,
[2:06:40] then those things drop.
[2:06:45] [applause]
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; They just drop off.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, we understand sin
[2:06:52] to be a nature.
[2:06:55] The life in the blood of Christ,
[2:06:58] the life that overcame sin
[2:07:01] walks to the center
[2:07:04] and takes the control of your desire.
[2:07:08] Amen. Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; So a call to rest.
[2:07:14] How many want rest this afternoon?
[2:07:18] Amen. We must rest.
[2:07:21] We must receive the rest.
[2:07:24] We must live like we've received the
[2:07:26] rest.
[2:07:29] We must allow the rest to work in our
[2:07:31] life.
[2:07:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. A man that has
[2:07:36] no rest
[2:07:38] is always blaming.
[2:07:40] The woman you gave me. Don't go and
[2:07:43] excuse yourself today.
[2:07:47] Tell your husband, "I have found rest.
[2:07:51] I'm not dealing with elements anymore.
[2:07:58] Amen. Doing the law of the spirit.
[2:08:03] Amen. So come to me
[2:08:09] and I'll give you rest. So you could be
[2:08:12] miles away from him
[2:08:15] and start the journey
[2:08:17] to the rest.
[2:08:20] Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Begin to walk towards him.
[2:08:24] Let Christ be the object of your life.
[2:08:29] And on the journey to the rest,
[2:08:32] we have three manifestations.
[2:08:36] Amen.
[2:08:40] justification by faith,
[2:08:42] sanctification through the blood
[2:08:45] and the b of the Holy Spirit. The moment
[2:08:49] we break through, then we have come into
[2:08:52] contact with the person himself.
[2:08:57] Amen. We shall have come.
[2:09:01] We shall have entered into fellowship
[2:09:04] with him.
[2:09:06] That's all our goal.
[2:09:08] is not just to become a good person
[2:09:12] just to be separated.
[2:09:14] Amen. Separated from uh uh the works of
[2:09:19] the flesh.
[2:09:21] Many times when we spoke we speak about
[2:09:23] redemption
[2:09:26] that's where we end.
[2:09:28] I don't drink. I don't smoke. I go to
[2:09:32] church. I don't fight my wife.
[2:09:35] We go beyond.
[2:09:38] Amen. The works of separation
[2:09:42] so that we can come into fellowship
[2:09:46] with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:09:49] That's what we are here for. Not to make
[2:09:52] good people.
[2:09:54] Your redemption
[2:09:56] is more than that.
[2:10:00] Amen. Amen. So Hebrews 4:11,
[2:10:04] he says, "Let us labor therefore
[2:10:09] to enter into the rest,
[2:10:13] lest any man fall after the example of
[2:10:17] unbelief."
[2:10:22] Now the word to labor
[2:10:26] in Matthew 11:28
[2:10:30] according to the Greek interpretation
[2:10:33] is the labor that wears you down
[2:10:39] like Israel in Egypt.
[2:10:44] They were in tiring labor
[2:10:48] until God says, "I have seen the
[2:10:50] affliction."
[2:10:54] And therefore, God calls Israel out.
[2:11:00] God has seen your affliction.
[2:11:04] God has seen YOUR LABORS.
[2:11:07] HE wants to call you into rest
[2:11:12] to come from labor
[2:11:14] and take the journey.
[2:11:17] Amen. Across the Red Sea of
[2:11:20] justification,
[2:11:23] from wilderness of sanctification,
[2:11:26] the Jordan of death to self,
[2:11:29] and then enter into canon,
[2:11:32] the land of rest.
[2:11:35] Amen. Amen. So come out of the labor
[2:11:39] that tires you
[2:11:42] into the labor
[2:11:45] to possess Canaan.
[2:11:48] And this war
[2:11:51] is not tiring
[2:11:56] because THE LORD
[2:11:59] CAUSES US TO INHERIT THE LAND.
[2:12:03] HALLELUJAH.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. In the rest we have seized
[2:12:07] from our labors.
[2:12:12] In Egypt
[2:12:15] they labored for no benefit.
[2:12:18] In Israel
[2:12:20] they fought wars
[2:12:23] which was not their wars.
[2:12:26] That was God's wars.
[2:12:28] And the commander
[2:12:30] of the Lord's army
[2:12:33] went ahead of them.
[2:12:35] When they got into the land, Joshua met
[2:12:38] him and he says, "Are you on our side
[2:12:42] or you against us?" And he says, "I'm
[2:12:45] the commander
[2:12:46] of the Lord's army." The war here
[2:12:51] is going to be fought by the Lord.
[2:12:54] You have now come out of the law of sin
[2:12:57] and death
[2:12:59] of the spirit
[2:13:01] out there. You labored for no gain.
[2:13:05] YOUR LABOR IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
[2:13:08] POSSESSION.
[2:13:12] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a quote here
[2:13:21] from Hebrews chapter one.
[2:13:24] I mean chapter four he says yours might
[2:13:29] have been at the 13th year
[2:13:34] the 40th year
[2:13:37] the fifth year
[2:13:39] whatever it is you have seized
[2:13:44] from your works
[2:13:48] I don't know how long you've labored
[2:13:52] but You have ceased from your work
[2:13:56] as God did from his
[2:13:59] eternally.
[2:14:01] You no more want the things of the
[2:14:03] world.
[2:14:05] The world is dead to you.
[2:14:09] Amen. Amen. So in the battle to possess
[2:14:13] the rest,
[2:14:16] we have the commander
[2:14:19] of the Lord's host
[2:14:21] standing in the land
[2:14:23] to make you possess the land.
[2:14:27] There he says, I want to make you seize
[2:14:29] from your labors.
[2:14:32] But here in Hebrews, he says labor to
[2:14:34] possess.
[2:14:37] So what's the difference there?
[2:14:40] So the word labor
[2:14:43] in Hebrews 4:11
[2:14:46] is not the labor that tires.
[2:14:51] Amen. The Greek word there
[2:14:55] is that give diligence.
[2:15:00] Amen. to make haste
[2:15:05] to exert oneself.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; There you labored without benefit.
[2:15:16] But here the labor HERE IS TO POSSESS
[2:15:19] THE LAND [screaming]
[2:15:21] TO POSSESS THE PROMISE.
[2:15:24] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Out there
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; they benefited nothing
[2:15:29] here. This labor here IS TOTALLY
[2:15:32] DIFFERENT. OUR LABOR IS DIFFERENT FROM
[2:15:36] THE LABORS OF EGYPT.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; WHERE ISRAEL BENEFITED NOTHING.
[2:15:42] Here we possess ground.
[2:15:46] [screaming] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here
[2:15:48] we possess ground.
[2:15:51] That is yours.
[2:15:54] That's yours. That is yours. This one,
[2:15:57] this is yours.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; So we are not laboring
[2:16:03] for nothing.
[2:16:05] The law of the spirit is to make you
[2:16:08] possess.
[2:16:10] So then he says labor to enter
[2:16:13] means that don't delay.
[2:16:16] Don't be sluggish.
[2:16:18] Take your step
[2:16:20] and possess THE LAND IS THERE. THE
[2:16:24] HOUSES YOU NEVER BUILT. THE STREAMS that
[2:16:27] you never dug,
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; all these things are here.
[2:16:32] You never planted.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; The pastor has labored
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; to make us understand
[2:16:42] the beauty of the land.
[2:16:46] Amen.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; So now here you are possessed.
[2:16:51] Amen. So then you labor to enter
[2:16:55] and remain in the rest.
[2:16:58] And this labor in Hebrews 4:11
[2:17:02] would be interpreted
[2:17:05] as the required diligence
[2:17:10] for you to remain in the land.
[2:17:15] You never took it for yourself.
[2:17:19] God gave it to you. But for you to stay
[2:17:22] in the land,
[2:17:24] you need to labor. And the labor here
[2:17:29] study.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Prayer,
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; fellowship with the saints,
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; the daily sacrifices,
[2:17:39] those things don't wear you down.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Like the life of sin where you were
[2:17:47] called from.
[2:17:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Will you labor to enter and remain?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:10.
[2:18:01] For he that is entered
[2:18:04] into his rest,
[2:18:07] he also receives from his own works
[2:18:12] as God did from his.
[2:18:15] Will you give him permission
[2:18:18] to take over your labors?
[2:18:22] Amen. Amen.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; He takes over your labors
[2:18:27] where you try to make salvation your own
[2:18:30] work.
[2:18:34] He says now open the door for me
[2:18:40] and I'll come in. And when I come in, I
[2:18:44] want you to change your labors
[2:18:48] into the labor
[2:18:50] to enter to the promise.
[2:18:54] Study,
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; pray, come to church, fellowship with
[2:18:58] the saints, testify of the goodness of
[2:19:01] God. Those things keep you in the Lord.
[2:19:06] Amen. Amen. So this therefore
[2:19:10] is not the labor that wears us down,
[2:19:14] but rather the positive yoke,
[2:19:19] which is a motivation
[2:19:22] to be motivated
[2:19:24] after you had the call.
[2:19:30] Amen.
[2:19:32] REST,
[2:19:34] REST FROM the law of the flesh.
[2:19:37] And therefore be motivated
[2:19:40] by the love of the spirit which is
[2:19:43] Christ himself doing his work in you.
[2:19:48] Allow him.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the law of the spirit of life
[2:19:54] in you
[2:19:56] begins to work in you
[2:19:59] causing you to possess ground
[2:20:05] where you always failed.
[2:20:08] The Holy Spirit comes
[2:20:11] and you don't know where the desire of
[2:20:14] alcohol went.
[2:20:17] You can't tell
[2:20:20] he came in. This is what we teach.
[2:20:24] Amen. Amen.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says the law of the spirit
[2:20:29] of God
[2:20:32] in the heart
[2:20:34] becomes the flesh
[2:20:36] and makes the body obey
[2:20:40] what the heart says do.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's now Christ on the inside,
[2:20:50] justifying you,
[2:20:52] sanctifying you, and baptizing with the
[2:20:55] Holy Ghost. It's not I anymore that's
[2:20:59] laboring.
[2:21:01] I've entered into my rest.
[2:21:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; What were we called for?
[2:21:11] To walk a religious life?
[2:21:14] No, sir. that Christ in me
[2:21:18] may perform his will.
[2:21:21] That's the yoke
[2:21:24] in questions and answers as I finish.
[2:21:28] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; You see, each one of those ages
[2:21:34] only taken a deep into the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:39] Justification is a work of the Holy
[2:21:41] Spirit.
[2:21:43] Sanctification is the work of the Holy
[2:21:44] Spirit.
[2:21:46] But the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:21:50] comes in now
[2:21:52] takes over.
[2:21:55] It's not a deep anymore.
[2:21:58] He now wants to come and takes charge of
[2:22:02] ourself.
[2:22:05] That's what we call the rest.
[2:22:08] Amen. It's not I but Christ in me.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; He wants to come and water the seed
[2:22:19] that he has planted in you and with the
[2:22:23] time you begin to bear the fruit.
[2:22:27] That's what God wants.
[2:22:29] Rest in him.
[2:22:38] Yeah. I don't know. Is that how it is
[2:22:40] sir?
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; You rest in Christ the rest.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; When you are shaken,
[2:22:55] when you are tried,
[2:22:59] you can't remove Christ
[2:23:03] and the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:23:06] and remain with the message.
[2:23:09] That's right. Rest.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; What do you want to rest this afternoon?
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:23:18] Come
[2:23:20] into your rest.
[2:23:25] He called you. You've walked a distance.
[2:23:29] You've come into him. He wants to
[2:23:31] baptize you. But after that, labor
[2:23:36] to remain.
[2:23:38] That's where the problem is. Labor
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; to remain. God bless you, brother.
[2:23:47] [applause]
[2:23:48] Yes, sir. Come on me, all you who labor
[2:23:51] under heavy ladder,
[2:23:54] and I'll give you rest.
[2:23:57] You want a restful church
[2:24:00] which is not in labor anymore.
[2:24:04] When we call the evening service,
[2:24:07] it's not a war.
[2:24:09] They are part of the precepts of the
[2:24:11] world.
[2:24:13] Are you together with me? When we have
[2:24:15] those conventions,
[2:24:17] you don't change your face.
[2:24:20] You have got a joy to come into that
[2:24:24] presence.
[2:24:26] Amen. That's what we are here for.
[2:24:29] God bless you. What's up? [applause]
[2:24:50] Come
[2:24:52] unto me
[2:24:54] all ye who labor and I heavy.
[2:25:03] I will give
[2:25:06] you rest.

[2:31:39] Lord, I'm tired of striving on my own.
[2:31:43] I'm tired, heavenly father, of doing it
[2:31:46] with my personal efforts. Lord, I want
[2:31:50] that rest
[2:31:52] that I can seize from my own works, that
[2:31:56] I can seize from my own thoughts, that I
[2:32:00] can seize from my ways, Father, that I
[2:32:03] may graduate, oh Lord, into a position,
[2:32:08] Lord, where I can be a love slave to
[2:32:11] you, where I can be a prisoner of
[2:32:14] Christ. [music]
[2:32:15] Like Paul said, "Oh, I am a prisoner of
[2:32:18] Christ." Father, how we desire this
[2:32:21] afternoon, Lord, if we are to be
[2:32:24] prisoners, God, then we would love to be

[2:32:30] we want to desire king of glory honestly
[2:32:33] in our hearts, heavenly father, for that
[2:32:35] rest. Oh king of glory, Lord God, you

[2:32:41] glory, that the law failed. You have
[2:32:45] taught us [singing and music] this
[2:32:46] morning, oh king of glory, that human
[2:32:48] works failed, oh king of glory, and it
[2:32:51] had to take, [music] oh, heavenly
[2:32:52] father, the power of the blood of Jesus.
[2:32:56] It was no longer the bulls and gods like
[2:32:59] it was in the Old Testament. They were
[2:33:02] just covering sin. But father you had to
[2:33:06] come down oh king of glory from heaven
[2:33:09] oh God and you poured out your blood on
[2:33:12] [music and singing] Calvary oh heavenly
[2:33:13] father and you says the life is in the
[2:33:17] blood and whosoever shall believe oh
[2:33:20] king of glory in the life of the blood

[2:33:40] heavenly father might be going through
[2:33:42] tough situations. Oh king of glory, may
[2:33:45] you remind us, oh God, that you are the
[2:33:48] perfect rest. Oh, heavenly [music]
[2:33:50] father, may the life from within inside
[2:33:53] us, oh Lord, cause us, oh Lord, to walk
[2:33:57] in holiness, oh king of glory. Because
[2:34:00] if the life of Christ is dwelling inside
[2:34:03] us, oh Lord, then that seed, oh king of
[2:34:06] glory, that gene of Christ is able to
[2:34:09] manifest his own life within us. Oh Lord
[2:34:12] may you be gracious to us. Oh king of
[2:34:15] glory Lord give us the victory. Oh
[2:34:17] heavenly father where we stumble. King
[2:34:20] of glory Lord we thank you heavenly

[2:35:29] that is new. Oh [music] heavenly father
[2:35:31] that you take away that stony heart oh

[2:35:57] as you taught us through your prophet
[2:35:59] lord that the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[2:36:02] word, Father. So when your spirit comes
[2:36:05] deep down [music and singing] inside, oh
[2:36:07] God, it changes our appetites, oh God,
[2:36:11] it changes our desires. It changes all
[2:36:14] the things, [music] oh king of glory,
[2:36:16] that we loved, oh father, that our
[2:36:19] focus, oh God, can be on thee, oh Lord.
[2:36:22] that our [music] desires, oh heavenly
[2:36:24] father, can be far beyond the things we
[2:36:27] see in [music] this life. Oh Lord, that
[2:36:29] our test, oh king of glory,
[2:36:32] is designed [music] by thee, oh father,
[2:36:35] we pray that you give us the overcoming
[2:36:37] power, Lord, in our areas of weakness.
[2:36:41] Oh Lord, [music] cause us oh heavenly
[2:36:43] father Lord through the power of the

[2:45:46] just want to make some [music] few
[2:45:47] announcements.
[2:45:51] We have an afternoon service today
[2:45:56] and it's for the youth who are in
[2:45:57] school. [music]
[2:46:00] Then next Sunday
[2:46:03] we also going to have two services
[2:46:04] [music]
[2:46:06] but afternoon service is for the youth
[2:46:08] after school.

[2:46:17] afternoon service [music]
[2:46:19] then in the next Sunday shall be youth

[2:47:16] Likewise, on Friday
[2:47:21] is the last Friday of the [music] month.
[2:47:25] We shall not have an overnight service.
[2:47:30] These are mostly issues of safety,
[2:47:33] especially on [music] Friday being that
[2:47:34] it's a festival season.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; So on Friday, we're not coming up an
[2:47:43] overnight service
[2:47:47] much as it's the last Friday of the
[2:47:49] month
[2:47:52] for issues of safety reasons.
[2:47:56] Praise the name of our Lord.

[2:48:14] starting at 3 p.m.
[2:48:17] We shall have the Lord supper and the
[2:48:19] foot washing
[2:48:23] just at the end of the service.
[2:48:27] So we shall not have a new year service
[2:48:29] on 1st of January.
[2:48:34] We just wanted to make these things
[2:48:36] clear
[2:48:39] so that you can have your clear plans.
[2:48:45] Then we have invitations for meetings.
[2:48:53] We have been invited to go to the the
[2:48:56] Eagle's Tabernacle in
[2:49:01] Tabernacle. There is a convention that
[2:49:03] is starting on Monday.
[2:49:07] Let me just get it here.
[2:49:12] Ego Tabernacle Church has invited us for
[2:49:14] a convention
[2:49:19] which will start on 28th to 31st
[2:49:22] December.
[2:49:28] And then they are saying
[2:49:31] for those who are coming
[2:49:34] you should carry personal belongings
[2:49:36] such as toothbrush and bucket.
[2:49:43] bed sheets,
[2:49:46] notebooks,
[2:49:48] Bible and a pen
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; and any contributions towards this
[2:49:54] conversion will be appreciated.
[2:49:59] That's from pastor Samuel Charles of
[2:50:02] church
[2:50:05] of church.
[2:50:08] Then we have also a convention starting
[2:50:10] on
[2:50:12] that same time but this one is on 29th
[2:50:21] up to 1st January
[2:50:24] and that's the youth convention at Gaza.
[2:50:30] So you need also to make a contribution
[2:50:32] of 100,000.
[2:50:37] By the end of last week only one person
[2:50:38] had shown interest
[2:50:44] because we had told people to register
[2:50:45] with brother William.
[2:50:50] So we encourage as many youth as
[2:50:51] possible to go and attend this
[2:50:53] convention. [music]
[2:50:57] Then also we having visiting ministers
[2:51:03] on Sunday 11th of January.
[2:51:10] We are going to have brother Steven do
[2:51:11] preach here.
[2:51:15] It will be two services
[2:51:18] and we shall be bringing in many
[2:51:21] brethren from different places to be
[2:51:23] with us.
[2:51:29] Then on 1st of February,

[2:51:42] He also be hosting many brethren to come
[2:51:44] with.
[2:51:48] Amen. Amen. Then we have the youth
[2:51:50] concert in the January.
[2:51:55] We had first put it on I think 18th
[2:52:03] but think that that week is for
[2:52:04] elections
[2:52:08] because on 15th
[2:52:11] we shall be having presidential and
[2:52:12] parliamentary elections.
[2:52:18] So we postponed our youth concert to
[2:52:20] 25th of January.
[2:52:27] So also we need to be prepared for that.
[2:52:33] Our young people
[2:52:37] in the preparations
[2:52:39] and then also your contributions are
[2:52:41] necessary.
[2:52:44] there are some equipments or things that
[2:52:46] need to be worked on
[2:52:50] and you know we need funds that we
[2:52:51] contribute for that.
[2:52:56] Then finally
[2:52:59] there is a brother who is printing out
[2:53:01] song books
[2:53:06] books and then English books
[2:53:11] and certainly 1,000 shillings at only
[2:53:15] 1,000 shillings.
[2:53:18] I would encourage each and every one of
[2:53:20] us to have those two books.
[2:53:26] We shall be singing those songs Luganda
[2:53:28] and English
[2:53:32] even at your home.
[2:53:34] So I would request those who are
[2:53:36] interested
[2:53:39] to register with brother Aula as well as
[2:53:42] give him the 1,000 or 5,000 or 10,000
[2:53:45] the number of books you want.
[2:53:50] There are those who have already
[2:53:51] expressed interest.
[2:53:54] I think he sent me a message here. Let
[2:53:56] me just get it.
[2:53:59] sent it to me on Friday
[2:54:03] and then showing that some people had
[2:54:05] already taken interest
[2:54:10] and we need people to have family books
[2:54:12] as well
[2:54:17] already people have expect to get 36
[2:54:19] books in English [music] and then 18
[2:54:20] books in Luganda.

[2:54:32] have them.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So may God
[2:54:38] bless you so much.
