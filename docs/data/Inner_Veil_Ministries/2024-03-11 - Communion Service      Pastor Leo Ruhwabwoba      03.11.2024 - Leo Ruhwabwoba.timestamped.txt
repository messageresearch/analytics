[22:32] all now let's proceed with this
[22:36] service yeah because I could forget
[22:40] that when Iana I don't know what I tell
[22:44] them so verse
[22:47] 3 we are in chapter
[22:52] 12 just we start from verse
[22:56] 38 read some few verses
[23:00] I know the is taking us
[23:05] somewhere we are in communion
[23:08] service if you want to title it just
[23:10] call it communion
[23:13] service we shall just here and
[23:16] there just trying to build our communion
[23:20] service and mixed M went up also with
[23:24] them and frogs and HS even very
[23:40] much and they baked anded cakes of of do
[23:46] which they brought forth out of Egypt
[23:48] for it was not Liv because they were
[23:52] thrust out of Egypt and could not t
[23:56] neither had they prepared for themselves
[23:59] in v
[24:28] verse 40 now the souring of the children
[24:32] of Israel who wred in Egypt was 430
[24:43] years and it came to pass at the end of
[24:46] the 430 years even the same day it came
[24:50] to pass that all the host of the Lord
[24:53] went out from the land of Egypt
[25:11] verse2 it is a night to be much observed
[25:14] unto the Lord for bringing them out from
[25:17] the land of Egypt this is the night of
[25:21] the Lord to be observed of all the
[25:23] children of Israel in their Generations
[25:45] 43 and the Lord said unto Moses and
[25:48] Aaron this is the ordinance of the
[25:50] Passover there shall No Stranger eat
[25:54] there
[26:04] but every man that is B for money when
[26:08] thou circumcised him then shall he eat
[26:24] thereof a foreign and servant shall not
[26:28] eat
[26:34] there one shall it be eaten Thou shalt
[26:37] not carry Force out the flesh abroad out
[26:40] of the house neither shall you break a
[26:43] bone
[26:56] thereof listen verse 47 all the
[27:00] congregation of Israel shall keep
[27:09] it verse 48 and when a stranger shall
[27:13] joury with them with thee and will keep
[27:15] the Passover to the Lord let all his
[27:18] males be circumcised and then let him
[27:21] come near and keep it and he shall be as
[27:24] one that is born in the land for no
[27:26] uncircumcised
[27:28] person shall get thereof
[28:04] may God bless the reading of the
[28:06] word we can get seated I know some of
[28:09] you are
[28:10] tired so this was the order of the
[28:14] Passover in the Old
[28:19] Testament they knew there were people
[28:22] who were among
[28:25] them but who were not Israelites
[28:29] when the Passover came when they would
[28:32] come to eat the
[28:34] Passover this was remembering the day
[28:37] they left
[28:39] Egypt when God told
[28:42] Moses to order every
[28:47] house and sprink on the
[28:50] door and we know all that was typing
[28:53] Jesus
[28:54] Christ and whichever house had the sign
[28:57] of blood
[28:59] the Ang of Des could not reach
[29:01] that if you were a if you are an
[29:05] Israelite and you refused that
[29:09] order in your house you every firstborn
[29:13] had to
[29:14] die no matter whether you are an
[29:16] Israelite as long as you refused that so
[29:21] the word of
[29:22] God is your life you have to take God at
[29:27] his word
[29:30] and believe every word that has come
[29:32] from the mouth of the
[29:35] Lord ordered them to always observe
[29:40] that and what what we are going to do
[29:43] now it is exactly like what they were
[29:46] doing
[29:48] in bless of Lord now this is our age
[29:53] this is how we are doing it because
[29:56] Jesus Christ came as a real
[29:59] sacrifice who offered his
[30:02] blood and that's why he said we should
[30:06] do
[30:09] itance of his death in remance of
[30:15] him
[30:18] Prophet remembering
[30:21] the remembering the
[30:23] Lord we have to always remember the Lord
[30:28] commanded the
[30:29] children always to
[30:32] observe the
[30:33] Passover and he
[30:36] [Music]
[30:38] said must
[30:41] take hallelujah hallelujah that's what I
[30:44] was saying in the morning that this is
[30:46] for every
[30:48] Christian every Christian is supposed to
[30:51] observe this
[30:53] ordin the ones which take us deeper in
[30:56] the RO
[30:59] blessed be the name of the Lord now here
[31:01] we see he said he
[31:03] commanded if there be any
[31:07] servant cannot take it unless he
[31:12] circumcised and once he
[31:14] circumcised is like one of you blessed
[31:18] be the name of the when you look at
[31:20] denominations how they do
[31:21] it they also know this truths and
[31:25] therefore they teach it their way if you
[31:28] do not follow their
[31:30] teachings
[31:32] levels you cannot also take
[31:34] their although we know that the
[31:37] communion that is taken in
[31:40] denominations is aong is wrong
[31:43] communion some take it in the morning
[31:46] some take it in the afternoon and
[31:50] yet
[31:52] theer and the children of Israel they
[31:55] took it in the evening
[31:58] so you know these days we are restored
[32:03] back the original faith we have we built
[32:07] on the
[32:07] foundation the apostles and
[32:10] Prophets Testament and New Testament the
[32:14] Old Testament was a shadow of the New
[32:18] Testament the Old Testament was a
[32:21] commandment and every Israel had to take
[32:25] it it was a must
[32:28] and everyone that was not an
[32:30] Israelite had to take the sign of
[32:33] Israel by being
[32:36] cumis and circumcision today the baptism
[32:40] of the Holy
[32:42] Ghost now today we know in the communion
[32:45] like
[32:46] this we cannot expect
[32:49] someone we cannot expect someone to come
[32:51] and take
[32:53] communion when he has not received Jesus
[32:56] Christ as our savior
[32:59] has not been baptized in the name of
[33:02] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[33:05] so that he can be called the
[33:09] circumciser blessed be the name of Lord
[33:11] so we have to follow the
[33:14] protocols of the word of
[33:17] God hallelujah the prophet says taking
[33:21] us back to the to the Old
[33:24] Testament he says now in the Old
[33:29] Testament blessed be the name of the
[33:31] Lord I will just try to be as fast as I
[33:35] can so that at least I can mention some
[33:38] few more words he says now in the Old
[33:42] Testament when the sacrifice was
[33:46] made a statute an
[33:49] ordinance an ordinance take an
[33:52] ordinance and so is water baptism
[33:58] so is f washing and

[34:47] statute all of his
[34:51] Commandments that he might have a
[34:54] right to enter into that threee right
[34:59] Hallelujah huj so it is up to you if you
[35:03] want to enter into the true of

[35:38] blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:40] hallelujah hallelujah now let's proceed
[35:42] with that
[35:44] quotation now Noti this
[35:47] now that in that fast when it was first
[35:52] an ordinance of God to bring sacrifice
[35:54] to the church
[35:57] and to the temple and the
[35:59] Altar and offer your
[36:02] gifts and your sins the sacrifice
[36:06] of where I can just
[36:09] imagine seeing some Jewish brother
[36:11] coming down the
[36:14] road knowing that he was
[36:17] guilty and he goes to the
[36:20] Altar and brings his fat o
[36:24] bar or whatever he had
[36:31] he brought it down the road as sincere
[36:34] as he could
[36:36] come he walked up
[36:38] there keeping God's
[36:41] ordance just
[36:43] a as he could
[36:46] be blessed the of Lord the Old
[36:50] Testament they were doing it
[36:54] sincer someone would give his
[36:59] his with a sincere heart and goes to the
[37:04] priest and offers it so they were doing
[37:09] it
[37:10] sincerely so the same thing we must do
[37:13] everything with
[37:16] sincerity hallelujah hallelujah then he
[37:19] laid his hands upon upon
[37:22] it remember this is for the remission of
[37:26] sins and these
[37:29] sacrifices would only cover their
[37:33] sin not remove them these LS they
[37:37] were they were typing a genuine
[37:42] L the L of God Jesus Christ for was not
[37:46] to cover our
[37:48] sins but he came to remove our sins he
[37:52] came to take away all our
[37:55] sins but look at this shadow what we
[37:58] have
[37:59] now how sincere they were then how much
[38:03] more sincere should we be
[38:06] today we have the most genuine
[38:10] one
[38:11] blessed they were very
[38:14] sincere in the offering of the
[38:17] sacrifice he just bring it down and
[38:20] raise
[38:22] hand the name of the Lord and confessing
[38:25] his
[38:26] sins like what we have to do today you
[38:29] have to confess all your sins whatever
[38:32] you have done whatever you know is not
[38:35] right this is an opportunity for putting
[38:38] yourself right just repent to the Lord
[38:43] his his Mery is here for you and me my
[38:46] brother my sister so they would put
[38:49] their hands on the sacrifice professing
[38:51] his sins and the priest placing his his
[38:55] upon the
[38:58] he he was
[39:00] confessing literally would go in

[45:02] message 24th October
[45:07] 1954 just for quick
[45:09] quotation I'm starting from
[45:13] par6 says if the Bible told not the
[45:19] baptism of the Holy
[45:22] Ghost and way back
[45:27] I would teach the same
[45:29] thing which the Bible teaches Jesus
[45:32] Christ the same yesterday today and
[45:34] [Music]
[45:36] for if the Miracles seed with the
[45:42] apostles I believe
[45:45] it but God said these signs will follow
[45:50] them to them to we follow them that
[45:53] believe to the end of the
[45:55] world and the says I believe
[45:59] it whatever we do if was not in the
[46:04] Bible was not done we wouldn't do it why
[46:09] would we waste our time hallelujah
[46:12] hallelujah but what we believe is what
[46:15] the Bible say and what we believe is
[46:18] enough to take us to Heaven whatever we
[46:21] are doing we are preparing for our
[46:23] future
[46:25] home Hallelujah Hallelujah parag 158 if
[46:29] they say people could only speak with
[46:32] tongues back in the apostolic
[46:35] age and said that that was only the age
[46:39] they would speak
[46:42] it I would believe it but he said these
[46:47] signs these signs and speaking in Tong
[46:51] was it was in it and PR on to the end of
[46:56] the
[46:58] wow I'm coming down what baptism in
[47:02] Jesus's
[47:03] name was to seed with the
[47:07] apostles and in the Catholic Church
[47:10] form the Father the Son and the Hool
[47:14] which was supposed to back there and
[47:17] start with this I would do the same
[47:19] thing but it is told and it is the same
[47:24] the gospel must be preached
[47:27] the world for the witness and then the
[47:30] end should come if sprinkling if
[47:33] sprinkling was in the
[47:38] Bible I
[47:42] sprink I'm showing you what we
[47:45] believe what we follow and why we follow
[47:50] he
[47:51] says if Bap if there was trity in the
[47:55] Bible I would believe it if there was
[47:59] people in the Bible who were
[48:03] sprinkled how was it done in the
[48:07] Bible it was done
[48:09] by Jesus Christ and that's how we should
[48:13] do it blessed be the name of the Lord he
[48:16] continues and says if feet washing was
[48:20] not in the
[48:22] Bible I wouldn't preach it but the Bible
[48:26] say
[48:27] happy are you if you know these things
[48:30] and do
[48:33] them Hallelujah that's why I'm saying
[48:36] you must know them why you are doing
[48:40] them and blessed are you after knowing
[48:44] them and you do them rejecting them is
[48:48] Judgment for yourself hallelujah
[48:51] hallelujah so here I'm encouraging you
[48:53] we must do all the ordin all the word
[48:56] that
[48:57] say how done we have to do
[49:01] it
[49:02] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[49:04] Lord paragraph
[49:07] 161 if the Lord supper was spiritual and
[49:11] was not to be taken naturally I would
[49:21] say but Jesus
[49:24] said do this and take these articles of
[49:28] his body until he returns
[49:33] again so who am I not to do it who am I
[49:38] to undermine it very important my
[49:41] brother my sister hallelujah hallelujah
[49:44] if we said Divine Healing he seed back
[49:48] there I believe but Jesus said they will
[49:53] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[49:55] recover until the end of the world I
[49:59] believe it do you believe it so I
[50:03] believe in SS following the
[50:05] Believers I stand up and see a lot of
[50:08] fanaticism rise up and act like that and
[50:12] more can make fun like
[50:14] this whatever we are doing we are doing
[50:18] according to the word of
[50:19] God was commanded to be
[50:22] done it is a m for you and me to do it
[50:25] so
[50:27] Hallelujah who am I not to do it the
[50:31] prophet says I believe
[50:34] it is in the Bible and because was done
[50:38] so hallelujah hallelujah then he says
[50:41] 164 I don't care then you can present
[50:45] the truth to
[50:46] them and you say here it is that says
[50:49] the
[50:49] Lord man looks at that he's not afraid
[50:53] of it and he walks away and say oh I
[50:56] don't believe
[50:58] it you have sined against the holy
[51:07] ghostess you don't believe take the word
[51:10] of God as it
[51:11] is you don't offend your
[51:15] pastor but you offend the Holy
[51:18] Ghost because it was written by the Holy
[51:21] Ghost you done something that you never

[51:50] ordinances I for us to
[51:53] do blessed be the of the Lord as they
[51:56] were
[51:57] and here this quotation continues I wish
[51:59] I would finish
[52:00] it let me finish it up there's something
[52:03] very important down here it says 166 if
[52:07] I come as far as oh River and there is a

[56:28] for that
[56:30] day blessed be the name of the Lord so
[56:32] you must ensure that you be there
[56:36] blessed be the name of the Lord apost
[56:38] Paul says when a day like this now we
[56:41] are in First
[56:42] Corinthians a very common scripture
[56:45] which every communion is
[56:47] read but we have to read it again and it
[56:51] will never be
[56:53] exhausted never will it be exhausted
[56:57] never will it be exhausted my brother my
[57:00] sister blessed the name of the Lord let
[57:03] it never be exhausted in
[57:05] your never be common to
[57:08] you let it be part of your life you the
[57:12] scripture read to you he supposed to be
[57:15] part of you that's why we say
[57:19] Amen that is
[57:22] mine be the name of the Lord so here AP
[57:25] PA gives us the of
[57:27] communion and the meaning of it he says
[57:32] I said it in the morning I have received
[57:34] of the Lord that I'm now first 11 I
[57:39] believe everyone knows that
[57:43] scripture uh from verse
[57:45] 23 Paul says for I have received of the
[57:49] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[57:54] you apost Paul is telling us of course
[57:58] we know he says my preaching my
[58:02] teaching my Revelation I was not given
[58:06] by any man I did not go in any Bible
[58:08] courage
[58:09] to given of the clear he saying what I
[58:14] was given of the
[58:16] Lord I fully give you don't you receive
[58:21] it why shouldn't we receive it knowing
[58:25] that is from the
[58:27] PA says follow me as I follow Christ he
[58:33] says when I came to you I never wanted
[58:36] to know anything or to see
[58:39] anything Jesus Christ who was
[58:42] crucified be SE in you and only that
[58:46] that is a center of our
[58:49] Union the Lord so he says what I
[58:52] received of the Lord I also give to you
[58:56] that the Lord the same day the same
[58:59] night he was betrayed took
[59:04] bread it was night not
[59:08] morning Hallelujah he took bread when it
[59:11] was
[59:12] night and when he had given
[59:15] thanks he broke it and said take it this
[59:18] is my body which is broken for you this
[59:21] do in remance of me verse 24
[59:25] [Music]
[59:35] hallelujah hallelujah not pleasing the
[59:38] pastor not a
[59:40] tradition we do it in remance of the
[59:45] Lord you know Catholics
[59:48] believe the
[59:50] eist that that
[59:53] bre they say that is the B of Jesus
[59:57] Christ that is real Jesus
[1:00:00] Christ
[1:00:11] exaggerate even this bread we are going
[1:00:13] to
[1:00:14] eat was made by a human
[1:00:17] being just just bread just just whe and
[1:00:23] water nothing special
[1:00:26] but
[1:00:28] Spirit it
[1:00:30] represents the body of Jesus Christ
[1:00:34] Jesus Christ said if you don't eat my
[1:00:37] body Dr my bre
[1:00:41] no so you must take it
[1:00:44] also just
[1:00:47] spiritually knowing that I'm eating
[1:00:50] the bless the it represents the body of
[1:00:54] Jesus
[1:00:56] but this is his
[1:00:59] commandment blessed the canot even
[1:01:04] be they
[1:01:17] with from the
[1:01:20] old to the New
[1:01:23] Testament during our Lord Jesus Christ

[1:01:30] that until he will
[1:01:33] come be the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:01:37] hallelujah he continues and says verse
[1:01:39] 25 after this man also he took the cup
[1:01:45] when he had
[1:01:46] Saed saying this cup is the New
[1:01:50] Testament in my bread this do you as
[1:01:54] often as you drink it in remance of
[1:02:09] me Hallelujah huj spoke it in Luke
[1:02:12] chapter
[1:02:13] 22 in Mark
[1:02:16] 14 it is all saying the same then he
[1:02:19] continues and says as often as you eat
[1:02:23] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:02:26] show the Lord till he

[1:06:48] everything then they took the Lord
[1:06:50] supper Theon in that very particular
[1:06:54] church was living in
[1:06:57] adulter and that very very
[1:07:01] morning he went woman

[1:07:08] catching
[1:07:10] him he
[1:07:12] survived anded they asked
[1:07:16] him but when the church had
[1:07:19] it you just
[1:07:21] wonder surely these words you have heard
[1:07:24] we thought we have all repented and put
[1:07:26] ourselves
[1:07:28] right there someone who is even a
[1:07:31] minister who is even a

[1:07:42] brother his wife divorced
[1:07:45] him she got married somewh else there

[1:12:17] oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:12:21] name of the Lord the prophet says I'm
[1:12:24] going to call some few quotations
[1:12:27] here then as I almost
[1:12:30] Closs he says for
[1:12:35] truly I think that is the duty of every
[1:12:42] Christian
[1:12:45] take the duty not of
[1:12:48] Christians Listen we say we are
[1:12:53] Christians if you are a Christian
[1:12:56] it's your
[1:12:59] duty
[1:13:03] take are we together
[1:13:06] s the Bible said if you take this
[1:13:11] note you have no party with
[1:13:14] me and I believe that it is a showdown
[1:13:18] time for
[1:13:21] Christians if we do not take it we have
[1:13:25] no party with him and if we take it
[1:13:29] and then we are guilty of the body and
[1:13:33] the death of
[1:13:36] Christ it's
[1:13:38] aown you to check
[1:13:42] yourself but you should first
[1:13:44] know your respons you have your duty to
[1:13:48] take
[1:13:50] it if you are not ready to take it today
[1:13:55] why because you should know if I don't
[1:13:59] take it I have no part in here but what
[1:14:02] is this that is cutting me from
[1:14:05] him why do you want it Holden on you why
[1:14:09] don't you cut it off and remain
[1:14:12] with
[1:14:15] blessed it's better for you to cut it
[1:14:17] off and with Jesus
[1:14:20] CHR so it's a
[1:14:22] showdown was on M
[1:14:28] when today we want to see those who have
[1:14:32] a true
[1:14:33] God God be your God be the true one let

[1:24:12] repent confess our
[1:24:14] fults and the prophet
[1:24:17] says talking about that the message that
[1:24:24] before we approach this sacred
[1:24:30] moment this is not an moment not a US
[1:24:33] moment we are entering a
[1:24:38] moment can someone say Amen as if I'm
[1:24:41] the only one who sees that as a
[1:24:46] moment he says you ask
[1:24:50] God to search my life
[1:24:55] hallelujah hallelujah this is what we
[1:24:57] are going into now ask the Lord to sech
[1:25:00] your
[1:25:02] life and if you have done anything that
[1:25:05] is not
[1:25:07] right I repeat if you have done
[1:25:12] anything that is not
[1:25:15] right
[1:25:17] say it's very simple
[1:25:21] say Lord forgive me
[1:25:25] hallelujah hallelujah forgive me for
[1:25:28] it you continue saying I don't mean to
[1:25:31] do
[1:25:33] it I make it
[1:25:36] right if you reveal it to
[1:25:40] me that's when you come
[1:25:43] together that's why me one for another
[1:25:47] let's wait on one another and let's pray
[1:25:50] for one another we want to take this
[1:25:52] communion
[1:25:54] if we don't do it we have no
[1:25:57] part so we have to put our life
[1:26:02] right we have to put our life
[1:26:05] right we must put our life right so that
[1:26:09] we take it in the right
[1:26:13] way hallelujah hallelujah we must take
[1:26:16] it in the right
[1:26:17] way BL be the name of the Lord then as
[1:26:20] we are checking
[1:26:22] ourselves BL be the name of the Lord
[1:26:24] let's continue with this
[1:26:26] quotation where he says every Christian
[1:26:28] has must take communion
[1:26:30] dy I want to jump a little bit it was
[1:26:37] misunderstood what it
[1:26:39] was Sinners and Men lying in
[1:26:44] sin come and take the
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:47] communion was
[1:26:49] misunderstood a man living with a mother
[1:26:52] Foster mother
[1:26:58] and the church had told him about it but
[1:27:01] still taking communion at the
[1:27:05] table that's why that's why when we are
[1:27:08] taking
[1:27:09] communion deons who know every
[1:27:13] Christian have to be
[1:27:16] very if you know a brother has some
[1:27:21] issues are saving him
[1:27:24] if you call him outside and ask him
[1:27:28] brother have you put
[1:27:31] right blessed the name this time of
[1:27:35] repenting if you know brother has an
[1:27:37] issue which you
[1:27:40] aware
[1:27:41] brother brother this is a sweet
[1:27:44] moment where we want the spirit of the
[1:27:47] to
[1:27:49] over not even sing
[1:27:54] so if you know anything
[1:27:56] about quickly call him outside and tell
[1:28:00] him about it and see if he can put it
[1:28:03] right can clear your heart so that's why
[1:28:06] I'm saying have to watch
[1:28:10] carefully someone who is not really
[1:28:15] worthy what I'm saying you have been
[1:28:18] handling his case and he has been
[1:28:21] stubborn and night like this you see him
[1:28:23] wanting take
[1:28:26] communion to
[1:28:29] take that's why the prophet is saying it
[1:28:32] was
[1:28:33] misunderstood people taking it
[1:28:36] any you understand blessed be the name
[1:28:39] of the Lord then he continues and
[1:28:42] says another thing they give it to
[1:28:45] people that
[1:28:48] drink
[1:28:49] that
[1:28:51] that you find even someone
[1:28:54] does not even pay
[1:28:57] TI and he wants to take
[1:28:59] communion you are here you don't pay
[1:29:02] TI you are you are not even
[1:29:05] a you are a
[1:29:08] Rob and you say you take
[1:29:11] communion this is not a joking
[1:29:14] matter bless the of let us be

[1:56:13] service uh I can see the table is
[1:56:16] already well
[1:56:19] set so we are aware the pastor
[1:56:25] announced after eating and taking the
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:30] wine then we shall be washing one
[1:56:34] another's
[1:56:36] feet as it was
[1:56:40] done we read it in John Chapter
[1:56:44] 13 the things we give you and read for
[1:56:47] our
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:49] reminder so that you should not think we
[1:56:52] just do things

[1:56:58] done so I must do it
[1:57:02] likewise amen so after we have done
[1:57:06] this as the
[1:57:08] pastor we shall wash one another's
[1:57:11] feet and as I said praying for one
[1:57:16] another sincere
[1:57:18] prayers then we shall be uh dismissing
[1:57:22] one another he says we shall be going at
[1:57:25] our own time so this is how it was
[1:57:28] done Jesus himself washes the disciples
[1:57:34] feet after they had eaten The Bread and
[1:57:38] Wine
[1:57:40] joh verse and the supper being
[1:57:44] ended the devil having now put the heart
[1:57:48] of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray
[1:57:51] him
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:58:05] verse four he raised from saer and laid
[1:58:10] aside his garments and took a tow and
[1:58:14] guarded himself
[1:58:22] water into the Basin and began to wash
[1:58:26] the disciples feet and to wipe them with
[1:58:29] the to where he
[1:58:40] was so for the sake of time you will
[1:58:44] continue reading at your own
[1:58:47] time but this is what we are going to
[1:58:50] do immed Med after taking after
[1:58:54] finishing the
[1:58:55] table after eating the bread
[1:58:59] and blessed be the name of the Lord yeah
[1:59:02] so uh before we go to the
[1:59:06] bread I saw have I also have a a
[1:59:10] wonderful prayer which I want to
[1:59:14] pray and which also I want you to follow
[1:59:16] the words there
[1:59:18] in no very very powerful words
[1:59:24] uh which the prophet
[1:59:26] said pertaining what we are going to
[1:59:29] do he
[1:59:31] says these little
[1:59:34] pel that
[1:59:36] is made without L seasoning and so
[1:59:42] forth we which represent the body of the
[1:59:46] Lord is not round it's broke in all
[1:59:50] pieces
[1:59:53] okay this bread will be broken in small
[1:59:57] pieces uh it's
[1:59:59] because that it
[2:00:01] means his broken
[2:00:04] body that was broken for
[2:00:07] us and may God grant His
[2:00:12] blessings
[2:00:18] everyone are you
[2:00:20] hearing the prophet is praying for you
[2:00:24] that this broken bread you are going to
[2:00:27] eat it represents the body of Jesus
[2:00:31] Christ and he says may you receive all
[2:00:33] the
[2:00:35] blessings that God promised
[2:00:38] you now it is not the
[2:00:41] body it is not this this bread is not

[2:00:45] body it only represents the
[2:00:50] body I have no
