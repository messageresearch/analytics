[9:21] 10 from verse 6se
[9:42] so the scripture
[9:46] says but from the beginning of the
[9:49] creation of God made them male and
[9:52] female
[10:00] for this cause shall a man leave his
[10:02] father and mother and C to his
[10:10] wife and they train shall be one flesh
[10:14] so then they are noral train but one
[10:25] flesh what therefore God has joined
[10:27] together let no man put
[10:37] amen we happy to be back again for the
[10:42] service we have our sister I think
[10:46] Shon you can stand up for

[10:54] some I think the last month or so
[11:05] Faith okay she's get Faith tet
[11:12] Faith amen we thank
[11:17] God she's a daughter of
[11:21] Pastor
[11:25] samel and she's employed in G with a
[11:28] certain love f
[11:37] amen so I want to take maybe a bit like
[11:41] an
[11:43] hour and talk about the anchor of
[11:48] marriage the anchor of
[11:51] marriage now in the message the
[11:55] absolute brother Bram
[11:57] says and the real again people of this
[12:03] age that is filled with the Holy
[12:07] Ghost is the tpost of this scripture
[12:11] that's going to be fulfilled in the last
[12:16] days they are the
[12:21] ultimate it is God's
[12:24] ultimate because it is his
[12:27] word and the word is
[12:30] Christ and
[12:34] the there is no way to get away from
[12:38] it something that holds
[12:42] you as I said it makes you do things
[12:45] that you would not
[12:49] do it made do things
[12:54] do it made do things he wouldn't do
[13:03] madees do things he wouldn't
[13:07] do it makes every man and woman do
[13:10] things they wouldn't
[13:14] do something that you are centered
[13:18] to it is something it is it's your
[13:25] stabilizer it is the anchor to the ship
[13:30] the ship is tied to the
[13:33] Anchor in the time of a
[13:36] storm and if Christ is your
[13:40] absolute you are tied to him in the time
[13:44] of
[13:45] trouble the ship if it if you Let It
[13:51] Rock it will break against The
[13:55] Rock but what they do they drop the
[13:59] an the anchor drags until it snugs into
[14:04] the Rock
[14:08] foundation and the Sheep is tied to the
[14:13] Anchor is the absolute for the
[14:17] ship and a born again
[14:21] Christian is tied to
[14:23] Christ and the Bible is the
[14:26] anchor it is the thing we ATT
[14:31] let the
[14:32] organizations let the different things
[14:35] let the science let the
[14:38] Educators say anything they
[14:40] want as long as that word says it and
[14:44] Promises
[14:47] it we are tied to that there is
[14:50] something won't let us move from
[14:54] it that's right a real born a real born
[14:58] Christian
[15:00] they stay with that word if he says a
[15:04] certain thing to do and the way to do it
[15:08] that's the way we must do
[15:11] it no matter what anybody else
[15:15] says that's what God
[15:18] say we are tied to that a Christian
[15:22] centered
[15:24] life praise the name of so brother Bram
[15:28] is describing what an anchor
[15:31] is and an anchor is something that holds
[15:34] like for example for a
[15:38] ship it holds the ship in one kind of
[15:43] position even when the storms
[15:46] come it its position is
[15:50] definite and then he says now even us as
[15:55] Christians praise the name of our Lord
[15:57] our anchor
[15:59] is the word of God and of course the
[16:02] word of God is God
[16:04] himself so even our
[16:07] marriage there is an
[16:10] anchor something that holds us
[16:14] back praise the name of our something
[16:17] that grounds
[16:18] you regardless of DS that we go through
[16:21] in
[16:22] life regardless of the challenges that
[16:24] we Face through in
[16:27] marriages and so we see that God started
[16:31] marriage and when God started
[16:34] marriage he gave us the guide on
[16:38] marriage and that is the word of
[16:41] God so when you are in
[16:44] marriage and God is away from
[16:48] you you will not be able to overcome
[16:51] troubles that
[16:53] come when you are in marriage and you're
[16:56] not following the word of God
[17:00] then you know that TRS will
[17:02] come and your marriage can be
[17:06] shattered praise the name of our Lord so
[17:08] then we need to see that in our
[17:11] marriage is Guided by the word of
[17:15] God the anchor the word of God is the
[17:19] anch of our
[17:20] soul and the word of God is the anchor
[17:23] of our
[17:24] marriage praise the name of our Lord
[17:27] like sometimes maybe your husband or
[17:29] your
[17:30] wife may not be doing to your
[17:34] expectation but then how about you what
[17:38] is your
[17:39] responsibility are you doing your role
[17:43] are you doing your
[17:44] part your your your
[17:48] contribution is subject to what he
[17:52] does she doesn't love you you don't care
[17:56] about if she's not submissive to you
[17:59] you also don't love her but that should
[18:02] not be so we are required before
[18:07] God that we fulfill our
[18:11] responsibilities praise the name of the
[18:13] Lord like the other time when we talking
[18:15] about
[18:17] stewardship and then brother Bram was
[18:20] saying that
[18:22] stewardship as long as you have a
[18:26] responsibility you are a steward
[18:29] praise the name of our Lord as a
[18:32] husband being a husband is a
[18:36] stewardship and when you become a
[18:38] husband that means you have a
[18:41] wife you are responsible
[18:45] for and now when you are
[18:47] married as a husband then you become a
[18:51] father again you get another stewardship
[18:53] of being a
[18:55] father the same thing with a wife you
[18:59] have a
[19:00] stewardship of being a wife to somebody
[19:04] to your husband so you have a
[19:06] responsibility to your
[19:09] husband but then again when you have
[19:11] become responsible to your
[19:14] husband then you get a stewardship of
[19:16] being a
[19:18] mother and you know it keeps on
[19:22] increasing praise the name of our Lord
[19:25] and each of these roads that we
[19:27] get the word of God clearly tells us how
[19:31] to handle
[19:33] everything as a wife what am I meant to
[19:36] do as a husband what am I meant to do as
[19:40] a father what am I meant to do as a you
[19:43] know a mother what am I meant to
[19:45] do some people can be good
[19:48] husbands some people can be good wives
[19:51] how about when you get
[19:53] children are you a good father are you a
[19:57] good mother all these are
[20:00] responsibilities praise the name of our
[20:02] Lord and you see that each of them
[20:04] requires your
[20:07] commitment it requires you to involve
[20:10] yourself fully into
[20:13] it and then you can't Del get that
[20:18] function praise the name of Lord you
[20:20] can't be a
[20:21] husband get another person to be a
[20:24] husband for your
[20:26] wife praise the name of our Lord or you
[20:29] can't be a wife and get another person
[20:31] to help you to be a
[20:34] wife that should also be the same thing
[20:37] with our
[20:38] children as parents we need to be fully
[20:41] concerned about our
[20:45] children praise the name of our Lord
[20:48] knowing how your child
[20:50] is that is your
[20:53] responsibility you know showing and
[20:55] guiding your
[20:57] child when you read in the
[21:00] scriptures you'll find that God will
[21:02] reveal the the the future of the
[21:07] child to the
[21:10] parents praise the name of our Lord God
[21:12] would show the
[21:14] parents what will be the future of the
[21:17] children God showed
[21:19] Rebecca the future of es and Isaac and
[21:26] Jacob God show
[21:30] Zaria the future of John the
[21:33] Baptist God keeps on revealing the
[21:35] future of your
[21:38] children God showed the future of the 12
[21:44] Patriarchs to to Jacob and then he was
[21:47] able to positionally place
[21:50] them with what God had ordained for
[21:54] them praise the name of our so now we
[21:57] need to see that take our responsibili
[22:01] seriously we that we take our Ro
[22:05] seriously see that we do the things that
[22:08] are right and pleasing to
[22:11] God what the Lord has called us to
[22:14] do praise the name of our Lord you know
[22:17] when Jesus Christ was saying in marthew
[22:19] chapter
[22:21] 19 and then verse
[22:24] 10 he
[22:26] said you know he was talking about the
[22:29] issue of
[22:31] marriage now in MTH chapter
[22:35] 19 and then verse
[22:38] 9 let us start from verse
[22:42] S they said unto him why did Moses then
[22:45] command to give a writing of divorcement
[22:48] and put her away
[23:08] he said unto them Moses because of the
[23:11] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[23:15] put away your wives but from the
[23:17] beginning it was not so
[23:29] praise the name of our Lord he was
[23:31] addressing a condition that was in the
[23:32] Old
[23:34] Testament before the full
[23:38] atonment could be done they had the
[23:42] condition of having picking one kind of
[23:45] like you
[23:47] know chusing each
[23:51] other you know all kind of trying to
[23:54] find each other's
[23:57] mistake if you are in a
[23:59] marriage and all the time you're busy
[24:02] picking your husband's or your wife's
[24:06] mistakes that is Hardness of
[24:09] Heart praise the name of our Lord all
[24:12] the time you're picking this Mist all
[24:14] the time you're picking this mist and
[24:16] you see what the devil does he will
[24:18] always show you those
[24:20] mistakes he will always show you those
[24:23] weaknesses and that's a condition of the
[24:26] hardness of the heart
[24:29] and when you have the hardness of
[24:31] heart the next thing the devil will tell
[24:34] you why don't you put
[24:37] our or even shows you alternatives to
[24:40] people you
[24:43] think ah the other one is better then
[24:47] you may think ah this one I've
[24:50] got praise the name of the Lord there's
[24:53] a time I think some years ago i' had
[24:56] gone to a washing B of the car
[25:00] and then there is a man who
[25:02] came and then he was asking one of the
[25:04] people were washing the
[25:06] cars and asking him about his former his
[25:11] former
[25:14] wife and then he was telling he was
[25:17] telling this
[25:27] man in other the one who married the
[25:29] wife who left his
[25:36] home if he's still having that
[25:39] wife he a strong man you know there are
[25:43] some people where mind is if I can
[25:45] offload this or if I can get somebody to
[25:47] offload this one
[25:51] here or if somebody comes and takes them
[25:54] away
[25:59] but you
[26:00] see to us that should not be
[26:03] so praise the name of the Lord looking
[26:06] for a separation
[26:09] Point looking for something that puts
[26:12] you
[26:13] away and so now Jesus says it was
[26:16] because of the hardness of
[26:18] heart that Moses could write a letter of
[26:24] divorcement but now we have the solution
[26:28] of the hardness of the
[26:30] heart and the hardness of heart can best
[26:34] be dealt by the blood of Jesus
[26:37] Christ if you can have your heart in the
[26:39] blood of Jesus
[26:41] Christ do not look at the mistakes of
[26:44] your husband or
[26:46] wife but you learn to appreciate the
[26:49] things that she she is
[26:53] good and what the Bible tells us we need
[26:57] to bear with one another
[26:58] another we need to have compassion for
[27:01] one
[27:02] another praise the name of our Lord so
[27:04] then Jesus tells
[27:06] them and I say unto you verse andever
[27:11] shall put away his wife except before
[27:13] fornication and shall marry another
[27:16] commit adultery and soever Mar that
[27:19] which is put away does commit adultery
[27:36] his disciples say unto him if the case
[27:39] of the man be so with his wife it is not
[27:43] good to
[27:52] marry now they are saying ah if if I get
[27:56] into it
[28:00] and I can't get out I don't want to be
[28:02] locked
[28:05] inside but you know
[28:09] knowingly you went into the marriage
[28:13] voice till
[28:16] death you know everything was good
[28:19] there then along the
[28:23] road you may even forget that you said
[28:25] it
[28:28] trying to kind of look for
[28:32] Corners I wish I could go back to my
[28:35] parents I wish I could get a job far
[28:38] away from
[28:41] here you know some people have troubles
[28:43] in
[28:45] marriage they will always have enough
[28:50] excuses to stay away from their husband
[28:52] so
[28:54] their somebody may desire to be with a
[28:57] job
[29:00] away but for you you think he looking
[29:02] for
[29:03] money but he's avoiding a certain
[29:08] problema and then
[29:10] another start to say maybe let me go for
[29:13] a c far
[29:15] away the problem is at
[29:20] home at
[29:22] home and you see these things keep on
[29:25] happening and then you see that the
[29:28] there is a
[29:31] separation there is no kind of affection
[29:34] for one
[29:35] another and then some people are in
[29:39] marriage just because of the children
[29:42] not because of the husband or the
[29:45] wife they are not they're not there
[29:48] because of the principal person
[29:52] they so now the Lord Jesus told them
[29:56] when they told them that if be so it's
[29:58] not good to
[30:01] marry then Jesus tell them in verse
[30:04] 11 he said unto
[30:07] them all
[30:10] men cannot receive this
[30:14] saying but who can receive
[30:17] it it is only them it is
[30:23] given praise the name of our Lord so
[30:25] then we should take this
[30:28] as our
[30:29] own that this
[30:32] saying is given to
[30:36] us not all can receive
[30:39] it not all can keep their marriage
[30:43] voice all can love their
[30:46] wives not all can be submissive to their
[30:50] husbands particular people who it is
[30:54] given who are obedient to the word of
[30:56] God so if you can have the anchor of our
[31:01] marriage as the word of
[31:04] God then we are the people this
[31:07] scripture is given to and then you'll be
[31:10] in your
[31:11] marriage without any
[31:15] regret I wish I I wish I known
[31:18] this now that okay you have known it ask
[31:22] for God for
[31:24] Mercy praise the name of our Lord ask
[31:26] God to give you Grace
[31:28] and then go over
[31:30] it praise the name of our Lord but then
[31:32] you don't start asking ways of
[31:37] exit all ways of putting
[31:39] away you don't start doing
[31:42] that praise the name of they will not be
[31:45] having a right
[31:48] attitude and instead that you will be
[31:50] falling into another
[31:53] scripture of being treacherous
[32:06] 2 and then
[32:10] verse
[32:13] 14 say yet you say wherefore because the
[32:17] Lord has been witness between thee and
[32:20] the wife of thy youth against whom thou
[32:22] Hast dealt treacherously yet she is thy
[32:25] companion and the wife of thy Covenant
[32:50] praise the name of Lord he said why have
[32:53] you dealt with her treacherously
[32:58] but when the the
[33:00] heart is covered by the blood of Jesus
[33:03] Christ do not deal
[33:06] treacherously praise the name of our
[33:08] Lord you not kind of like
[33:12] Revenge she has done this to me let me
[33:15] do this he has done this to me let me do
[33:18] this we are the children of
[33:21] God and as children of God we do things
[33:25] according to the word of God
[33:29] praise the name of our Lord having

[38:07] showing
[38:10] good you know you is
[38:13] curing you
[38:14] bless praise the name of our Lord now we
[38:19] can get to another scripture
[38:22] here inth 22: 11
[38:29] praise the name of our
[38:37] Lord the scripture
[38:40] says and when the king came in to see
[38:42] the guest he saw there a man which had
[38:45] not a wedding
[38:56] garet and he said unto him friend how
[38:59] came thou in hither not having a wedding
[39:02] garit and he was
[39:12] speechless the name of the Lord now this
[39:15] was a
[39:16] marriage and people were
[39:20] invited praise the name of our Lord and
[39:22] in a marriage like a marriage we are
[39:25] talking about here
[39:28] nobody is forced into
[39:31] it praise the name of our Lord and so
[39:33] here a person will
[39:36] enter but the way he entered when he was
[39:40] inside the
[39:41] hall he never had the wedding
[39:45] G and now in the marriage to
[39:49] happen there is a need for a wedding
[39:54] garment praise the name of our Lord the
[39:57] G here we can look
[40:00] at is
[40:02] character praise the name of the Lord so
[40:04] you need to see that you keep your
[40:06] wedding
[40:09] garment your character in
[40:12] marriage is very
[40:15] important but then how do you enter into
[40:18] a
[40:18] marriage and then you don't have a
[40:20] wedding G and then you don't have a
[40:23] character so we are meant to have the
[40:26] character
[40:28] praise the name of our Lord a character
[40:30] in our
[40:32] marriage and our character is after
[40:36] Christ praise the name of our Lord in
[40:39] your
[40:40] marriage see that you have your wedding
[40:44] garment your true Christian character in
[40:47] your
[40:49] marriage praise the name of the Lord
[40:51] your character to your
[40:53] husband your character to your wife your
[40:57] to your
[40:58] children in your marriage because it is
[41:01] very
[41:02] important if your character is not
[41:05] good then you are giving a bad example
[41:08] to your
[41:11] children so what you are demonstrating
[41:13] to them is not the
[41:16] best and then at the end of the day
[41:20] there are challenges that are going to
[41:21] come in
[41:23] future praise the name of our Lord I was
[41:25] reading a scripture in the book of I'm
[41:28] forgetting the place I think it is
[41:31] Psalms and then it was saying that their
[41:34] young men were killed in
[41:38] battles and
[41:43] then they were not they didn't have
[41:46] people to marry
[41:47] them and this is what's happening
[41:50] now the young
[41:53] men killed in
[41:56] battle funny things they get involved
[42:00] in
[42:02] drugs
[42:03] smoking evil character wrong
[42:07] influences like there is a village I
[42:10] think is I I'm forgetting the district
[42:12] in the county in
[42:13] Kenya it central part of
[42:18] Kya I'm just forgetting the name of the
[42:21] county before last year those women were
[42:25] demonstrating
[42:28] and then they were calling on the
[42:30] government to help
[42:32] them because they don't have
[42:35] husbands the husbands they
[42:38] marry they all the time
[42:41] drinking the young men
[42:51] alling terrible condition and now that
[42:55] comes back to us as parents
[42:58] how are we raising our
[43:01] children praise the name of our Lord how
[43:04] are we raising
[43:05] them it is our
[43:08] responsibility to raise them in the way
[43:10] of the
[43:11] Lord to give them a true character of
[43:14] Jesus
[43:16] Christ praise the name of our Lord so
[43:19] then we need to see that they are given
[43:21] the
[43:23] truth and then even we live the truth
[43:27] the life of the
[43:29] word giving them a good
[43:32] example praise the name of the Lord the
[43:34] scripture says if you raise up your
[43:37] child correcting your child you'll have
[43:41] peace later
[43:42] on but then if you have failing to raise
[43:45] your
[43:46] children you'll have troubles
[43:48] ahead so you'll find that the decision
[43:51] making also
[43:54] bad you'll find the friends of your
[43:56] child and not the best friends they
[44:00] are because he has no value of
[44:05] character he doesn't see something which
[44:07] is meant to be
[44:09] right he always take things
[44:14] lightly
[44:15] like the Bible says took it as made it
[44:19] as a light thing
[44:27] so he was hipping one scene on another
[44:29] one on another one SC on another and he
[44:32] took it as a
[44:34] light how are we raising our
[44:36] children how are we making our
[44:40] families for you complaining is not Is
[44:42] Not a Bad
[44:44] Thing
[44:46] abusing is not a bad thing you taking it
[44:50] lightly but it's a spirit taking charge
[44:54] of until the children will learn how to
[44:56] do it
[44:59] how they can abuse either learned it
[45:01] from the father learned it from the
[45:04] mother and now it goes on and
[45:07] on even when they marry continue with
[45:11] the
[45:12] same because they don't see any
[45:14] difference so we need to see that we
[45:16] live a true Christian
[45:20] character
[45:21] marriage Guided by the word of
[45:24] God praise the name of our Lord
[45:28] let us also go to another scripture
[45:30] here in
[45:36] 25: he says and while they went by the
[45:40] bridegroom came and they that were
[45:43] already went in with him to marriage and
[45:45] the door was shut and afterward came
[45:48] also the other virgin saying Lord open
[45:51] for us
[46:14] praise the name of our Lord now this was
[46:16] a marriage
[46:20] supper praise the name of the Lord the
[46:23] five virgins were
[46:25] ready but the five foolish were not
[46:33] ready and then the Bible says when the
[46:37] bridegroom
[46:39] came he only took with him those that
[46:42] were
[46:45] ready to go into the
[46:48] marriage and then those who were already
[46:50] went
[46:51] in the door was shut and then the others
[46:55] came later on
[46:57] praise the name of the Lord so now each
[47:00] of us who is
[47:02] married you desire to get into that
[47:05] marriage you desired to get into that
[47:09] Mar praise the name of our Lord you even
[47:11] made Readiness for
[47:14] it
[47:16] everything praise the name of how about
[47:20] now what is going
[47:23] on praise the name of our Lord and yet
[47:25] we need to see that we make our
[47:29] marriages
[47:32] pleasant we need to see the B told us
[47:36] in 2
[47:42] verse4 that I was a
[47:45] witness when you are having the wife of
[47:48] your
[47:49] youth how about now 2 years now years
[47:54] now 10 years now 20 years
[47:58] now and you see the very unfortunate
[48:01] thing
[48:02] here some people
[48:05] marry and within one year they are not
[48:07] longer living
[48:08] together then you start
[48:11] asking what
[48:13] happened praise the name of Lord you
[48:16] start wondering what
[48:18] happened within one year you can't live
[48:22] together as husband and wife where was
[48:25] the problem
[48:28] praise the name of our Lord now in the
[48:30] message the Third
[48:31] Exodus he
[48:36] says a woman marry a
[48:41] man and disagreeing with
[48:45] him it would be some kind of first
[48:49] continually
[48:59] but when a man and his and his wife his
[49:02] girlfriend is
[49:08] spouse when they are in Perfect
[49:15] Harmony like one soul and one
[49:21] mind because they are going to be one
[49:24] flesh
[49:27] praise the name of the Lord so in
[49:29] marriage you get your
[49:33] kind you get your
[49:36] likeness like Adam praise the name of
[49:40] the Lord you know when you look in the
[49:43] scriptures the first
[49:45] marriage was between Adam and
[49:49] Eve and the last
[49:51] marriage the last
[49:53] [Music]
[49:55] marriage is between Christ and the
[49:58] bride and now we can draw examples from
[50:00] the first
[50:03] marriage and even in the last marriage
[50:06] and how our
[50:08] marriages the first
[50:11] marriage Adam got a wife was from his
[50:15] his
[50:17] body Christ in the last marriage a wife
[50:22] who has his
[50:23] Spirit praise the name of our Lord so
[50:26] it's the same thing now for our brothers
[50:29] and sisters who want to
[50:33] marry praise the name
[50:35] of where is your
[50:39] likeness where is that which is part of
[50:41] you in that
[50:46] person because if somebody has got a
[50:49] part of
[50:51] you regardless of the
[50:55] disagreement that part of of you in
[50:58] them we always keep you
[51:01] together praise the name of our Lord so
[51:03] then how can it come that within one
[51:05] year everything is upside
[51:08] down that means there was something
[51:11] wrong
[51:12] somewh praise the name of our Lord so
[51:15] you need to get somebody who has the
[51:17] word of
[51:19] God brother Bram tells us that if
[51:22] somebody is not born again
[51:26] is not filled with the spirit of
[51:29] God you know they as good as
[51:33] animals how would you marry an
[51:36] animal praise the name you know there
[51:39] are some people who marry headless
[51:46] men and your husband is
[51:52] headless because the Bible says the head
[51:55] of a man is
[51:57] Christ but now the other one marries a
[52:01] man
[52:04] headless when Friday
[52:06] comes disc
[52:09] head like
[52:13] today going out
[52:17] headless praise the name of the Lord so
[52:20] you don't marry headless
[52:23] man and people who do PCM always get
[52:26] those people for are
[52:30] headless just brings a headless
[52:34] man and Mar a
[52:36] headless now when the headless man start
[52:39] seeing other
[52:42] girls but the man is
[52:47] headless prise the
[52:49] name the guy is headless so what do you
[52:52] do for him to get a head
[52:56] praise the name of that's when you'll be
[52:58] able to know that he's my
[53:00] husband but when they not they
[53:04] headless
[53:08] a you can't describe
[53:10] him praise the name of like there was a
[53:14] scenario the brother went and picked a
[53:19] sister of course they were
[53:22] married and
[53:24] then the sister for her
[53:28] she just wanted to be in in show in
[53:31] shows trans
[53:36] night and then he was telling the
[53:38] Sister Sister Believers don't don't
[53:42] behave like
[53:43] that she was not a
[53:47] Believer I wish you first preach the
[53:50] gospel ofers before preaching marriage
[53:56] you first preach out to get
[53:59] converted before preaching out to marry
[54:03] you but now you get in the
[54:06] house you pre
[54:13] toed this is Believers don't behave like
[54:17] that didn't care that's her
[54:23] nature so then we need to see that we
[54:25] follow the way God did in the first
[54:30] marriage because God
[54:32] said it's not good for a man to be
[54:37] alone but even not good to be
[54:42] alone he had to be that that
[54:46] Gap had to be fed by a certain
[54:53] character and the Bible says God brought
[54:56] all animals before
[54:59] Adam the was
[55:03] not now God make Adam fall into a deep
[55:08] sleep and then he created a
[55:11] woman Adam and then brought her to
[55:15] Adam Adam
[55:17] realized she's born of my
[55:20] B Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
[55:24] woman praise the name of our
[55:26] he got his own
[55:29] likeness and so in marriage you get your
[55:33] own
[55:35] likeness and brother Bram says if you
[55:38] want to know the character of a
[55:41] man look at the
[55:43] wife praise the name of look at the wife
[55:47] if the wife complains a
[55:49] lot maybe the husband does the same in
[55:51] his
[55:53] heart much as may not speak
[55:56] because that's what pleased
[55:59] him you marry your
[56:03] likeness but now in all these things the
[56:06] word of God should direct
[56:09] us the word of God should guide
[56:12] us in our marriage praise the name of
[56:15] our Lord now if you in a
[56:18] marriage make your marriage work
[56:22] out if your wife is doing things which
[56:25] are not right
[56:26] if your husband doing things are
[56:28] not praise the name of our Lord call
[56:32] upon the name of the
[56:33] Lord pray for
[56:36] them and it becomes your burden
[56:39] now praise the name of so you carry your
[56:43] burden you pray for her you pray for him
[56:48] praise the name of our Lord because they
[56:50] are part of
[56:51] you and say Lord give me Grace in the
[56:53] challenges that I'm facing
[56:58] praise the name of the
[56:59] Lord there is a
[57:03] long think I don't know if I can go
[57:05] through
[57:09] it maybe we'll just read the section
[57:11] because I want to finish
[57:15] soon you know brother Bram was having at
[57:19] his
[57:20] home and then just come all the time to
[57:23] be prayed for
[57:26] there was actually an atmosphere which
[57:28] was not the
[57:31] best people
[57:33] crying and then some people coming to a
[57:36] brother
[57:39] home this that now the wife all the time
[57:44] from morning cooking for the
[57:48] visitors
[57:49] until she said I'm losing my mind
[57:58] these children have not had a bite to
[58:00] eat all the day
[58:03] long then he says had some nervous
[58:06] people
[58:08] there mental
[58:11] [Music]
[58:13] cases some of them walking up and down
[58:16] the
[58:18] floor telling me that the Lord is going
[58:21] to strike me
[58:23] dead if I didn't go to a certain town
[58:26] town because they said so and that's the
[58:30] kind you have to put it all
[58:33] together and another one in another room
[58:37] saying oh you don't know what he's
[58:39] talking
[58:40] about I got th says the
[58:43] Lord if the Lord wanted me to know
[58:47] anything would tell me he's not afraid
[58:50] to talk to me and then but you have to
[58:53] put up with those with that some
[58:55] sometimes
[58:58] she said I don't know what to
[59:01] do well look they set Sarah and Bing the
[59:06] floor passing over some little

[59:39] floor beating on something as hard as he

[59:46] his
[59:47] voice now you talk about a home sweet
[59:52] home then he says well I looked around
[59:57] I thought now there is just one thing to
[1:00:01] do we got to change this
[1:00:04] situation now those people they are
[1:00:08] through the day so many and all through
[1:00:11] the night does disturb the

[1:00:17] while so I thought Lord now you help me

[1:00:35] it in
[1:00:37] love he prayed about it Lord help then
[1:00:42] he had to go and ser we can help the
[1:00:46] wife P her down and kept on praying
[1:00:50] until the children are able to agree
[1:00:52] with one
[1:00:54] another you know not to fight one
[1:00:56] another and then the whole stuation came
[1:00:58] to
[1:01:00] C praise the name of sometimes our homes

[1:01:05] of but then the approach to the
[1:01:10] challenge it matters a lot praise the

[1:07:29] issues praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:07:32] need to see that God gives us
[1:07:35] Grace in our
[1:07:37] marriages let us hold to the word of
[1:07:40] God have compassion for one another see
[1:07:44] that you love one another
[1:07:47] greatly even in their
[1:07:50] weaknesses even in their
[1:07:52] failures love one another that's what
[1:07:55] the Bible has told us show compassion
[1:07:58] for one
[1:07:59] another let God be the center of our
[1:08:03] marriage we everything according to the
[1:08:06] word of

[1:08:13] any problem present it to the Lord
[1:08:17] praise the name of our Lord and you know
[1:08:18] the Bible says when two or three agree

[1:08:29] what us about this kind of

[1:08:40] the challenges that we
[1:08:43] have let our homes be full of
[1:08:47] love you know the love of God the peace

[1:08:56] to be a very good example for the
[1:09:00] family praise the name of our Lord let
[1:09:02] us finish with proverb
[1:09:05] 11 and then verse
[1:09:10] 29 the Bible says he that travels his
[1:09:14] own house shall inher wind and the fo
[1:09:16] shall be servant to the wise of heart
[1:09:26] praise the name of the Lord says if you
[1:09:29] travel your
[1:09:31] house you inherit
[1:09:35] wind as we in the
[1:09:37] marriage let us not trouble our
[1:09:41] house choosing your
[1:09:44] wife choosing your husband no respect
[1:09:48] your wife no respect to your
[1:09:51] husband no love for one
[1:09:53] another dist each
[1:09:56] other you are traveling your house and
[1:09:59] when you travel your house at the end of
[1:10:02] the day you inherit
[1:10:05] wind so instead of traveling our

[1:10:12] do the best to put it
[1:10:16] together praise the name of our Lord not
[1:10:18] to destroy it but build it to be a

[1:10:27] better and you know as you keep on
[1:10:29] living
[1:10:30] together you keep on learning each
[1:10:33] other so in other words you are able to
[1:10:36] bear with one another much more
[1:10:40] than praise the name of our Lord and as
[1:10:43] we live
[1:10:44] together some things keep on changing in
[1:10:47] our
[1:10:48] Liv because you're growing
[1:10:51] older challenges keep on coming
[1:10:55] different stations keep on
