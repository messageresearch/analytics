[35:07] 9 we shall read out a number of
[35:09] scriptures
[35:11] there amen I think our interpreter
[35:16] brother Salas has communicated he has
[35:19] had an appropr meeting that was actually
[35:23] staged from 5 to 6 and he's not able to
[35:28] be with us
[35:30] amen so let's pick up from verse
[35:34] 9 and the scripture says I John also am
[35:39] your brother and companion in
[35:41] Tribulation and in the kingdom and
[35:44] patience of Jesus Christ was in the iso
[35:47] that is called pmos for the word of God
[35:50] and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I
[35:54] was in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[35:57] had behind behind me a as of a trumpet
[36:01] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[36:05] and the last and what thou seest write
[36:09] in the book and send it unto the
[36:12] churches the seven churches which are in
[36:14] Asia unto Ephesus and unto smina and
[36:18] unto pamos and unto thyra and unto sadis
[36:22] and unto Philadelphia and unto laia and
[36:26] I turn to see The Voice which spark with
[36:28] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[36:33] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[36:35] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[36:38] of man clothed with a garment down to
[36:42] the foot and got about the pups with a
[36:45] golden G and his head and his hairs were
[36:50] like were white like wool and as white
[36:53] as snow excuse me and his eyes were as a
[36:57] flame of fire and his feet like unto
[37:00] fine brass and as if they burned in a
[37:04] furnace and his voice as the sound of
[37:08] many Waters and he said he had in his
[37:12] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[37:15] mouth went a sharp twoed sword and his
[37:18] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[37:22] his
[37:22] strength amen may the Lord add a
[37:25] blessing to his word may we be seated
[37:29] amen so I we shall I'll be speaking
[37:34] tonight on the subject of the spoken
[37:37] word and
[37:39] absolute amen so we've picked up from
[37:42] the book of Genesis sorry Book of
[37:45] Revelations where John is introducing
[37:50] the Book of Revelations and he says I
[37:53] John who am also your brother and
[37:56] companion in Tribulation
[37:58] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[38:01] Christ was in the iso that called pmos
[38:05] for this for the word of God and for the
[38:07] testimony of Jesus Christ amen so we
[38:11] know the history of this of John we know
[38:14] that John after he had suffered
[38:17] tribulation after he had suffered
[38:19] persecution for the word of God like he
[38:22] said in verse 9 they tried to kill him
[38:25] boil him up and he could not not die so
[38:28] they went and imprisoned him on an
[38:30] island praise the Lord that was full of
[38:33] these uh poisonous snakes and animals
[38:37] and while he was there he says he was in
[38:41] the spirit so he was carried up in the
[38:44] spirit and then he says I was in the
[38:46] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[38:49] behind me a great voice as of it of a
[38:51] trumpet and a voice said unto him I am
[38:55] Alpha and Omega
[38:58] the first and the last praise the Lord
[39:01] so now the voice that spoke to him said
[39:04] he is the Alpha and Omega meaning before
[39:08] him there is none and after him there is
[39:10] none praise the Lord says the
[39:15] begin and what thou seest write in a
[39:19] book and send it unto the seven churches
[39:21] which are in Asia in verse 12 he said
[39:26] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[39:29] with me and being turned I saw seven
[39:31] golden
[39:33] candlesticks so now there was a voice
[39:35] that spoke to him and the voice was
[39:37] telling him I am an identification that
[39:43] P he's an individual he says I am the
[39:45] Alpha and the Omega and when he turned
[39:49] to see The Voice he said as I turned I
[39:52] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[39:55] midst of the seven golden candles the
[39:58] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[40:02] of man praise the Lord so now there was
[40:05] the son of man who was in the midst of
[40:07] the seven candlesticks and he is the one
[40:11] that was speaking to John praise the
[40:13] Lord so he identified himself as the
[40:16] Alpha and the Omega praise the Lord
[40:19] because JN was bearing witness of Jesus
[40:24] Christ he had been persecuted for Jesus
[40:27] Christ so he had known Jesus Christ
[40:30] personally praise the Lord so that's why
[40:33] when he turned to see he says when he
[40:36] turn to see he saw seven golden
[40:40] candlesticks and in the midst of them
[40:43] one like the son of man clothed with
[40:46] garment down to the and got about the
[40:51] the PPS with golden a golden G so we
[40:54] notice here this man man that
[40:59] stands of the
[41:02] seven which the scripture say the seven
[41:05] Church ages praise the Lord he is one
[41:08] like unto the son of man and his head
[41:11] and his hairs were white like wool and
[41:15] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[41:18] flame of fire and his feet like andto
[41:21] fine brass as if they burned in a
[41:24] furnace he's giving a description of the
[41:27] person that he saw in the midst of the
[41:30] seven candles praise the Lord but
[41:33] remember what he said to him when he
[41:35] turned the scripture says what he said
[41:39] he said I am the alpha and I I'm the
[41:43] Omega praise the Lord and that's why we
[41:46] are picking our text he is the alpha and
[41:49] he is the Omega praise the Lord before
[41:52] the alpha there is nothing there is none
[41:56] after him there is none so that makes
[41:59] him the absolute praise the Lord that
[42:02] makes him the absolute that besides him
[42:05] Jesus Christ there is none praise the
[42:08] name of the Living God and he
[42:11] said and he had in his right hand Seven
[42:15] Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp
[42:19] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[42:23] as the sun shineth in his strength in
[42:26] his right hand Authority control praise
[42:30] the Lord he had the Seven Stars and we
[42:34] know the Seven Stars were sent to the
[42:37] seven Church ages praise the Lord the
[42:40] Seven Stars which are the Angels which
[42:43] are the messengers that were sent to the
[42:46] seven Church ages so now we see that one
[42:49] who stood in the midst of the seven gold
[42:53] golden candlesticks which is Jesus
[42:55] Christ he had has the authority over the
[42:59] church praise the Lord because the
[43:02] church is in his hands and The
[43:05] Messengers are in his right hand which
[43:08] implies Authority control over the
[43:11] church praise the Lord and now we note
[43:15] something here that out of him out of
[43:18] his mouth went a Shar to edged sword and
[43:23] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[43:26] in his strength a two-edged
[43:28] stro precedes out of his mouth and this
[43:34] is the spoken word this is the word of
[43:37] God it is sharper the Bible calls it
[43:40] sharper than a two-edged sword praise
[43:42] the Lord so out of the mouth of the one
[43:46] who stood in the midst Jesus Christ the
[43:49] son of man who had authority over the
[43:53] church proceeded the two agged sword
[43:57] praise the Lord and now this spoken word
[44:01] are the instruments that he gave to the
[44:05] seven Church ages praise the Lord as we
[44:08] shall see when when John saw and he
[44:12] heard when he looked at him he saw a
[44:15] two-edged sword coming out of the mouth
[44:18] of him that was in the midst of the
[44:20] seven gold candlesticks praise the Lord
[44:23] and now and when I saw him he says I
[44:28] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[44:31] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[44:34] not I am the first and the last before
[44:40] him there is none I am the first so
[44:43] before me there is none praise the Lord
[44:46] he's giving a description he's giving a
[44:50] revelation of who he was praise the Lord
[44:54] remember when Jesus Christ was still
[44:56] here on Earth
[44:57] during his ministry praise the Lord he
[45:00] spoke to us in Parables he spoke when
[45:03] was teaching he was teaching in Parables
[45:06] but could write stand up and say I and
[45:09] my father are one then he could again
[45:12] say I don't speak anything of myself but
[45:15] I speak what I have heard of my father
[45:18] praise the Lord so he was trying to say
[45:21] that he and the father are one so he is
[45:24] in the father and the father is in him
[45:27] but now here he's plainly speaking to
[45:29] John because he said the things that you
[45:32] see and hear write them and send them to
[45:35] the churches so he's ex trying to show
[45:39] himself now to the church he's revealing
[45:41] himself to the church and says I am the
[45:44] first and the last praise the Lord he's
[45:47] now not saying I am like the first but
[45:50] now he's saying I am the first so before
[45:53] me there was nothing so John looked
[45:56] behind and he looked in Genesis when he
[45:59] heard him I am the first he looked in
[46:02] Genesis and when he looked in Genesis he
[46:05] saw in Genesis that scripture says in
[46:07] the beginning there was God and what did
[46:10] God do praise the Lord in the beginning
[46:13] was God was the word and the Word was
[46:15] with go was with God that is in John but
[46:18] now in Genesis we see the beginning
[46:22] beginning with God himself praise the
[46:24] Lord and now he comes down and he starts
[46:27] making creation he begins to create the
[46:31] world and when he began to create the
[46:33] world he was creating the World by the
[46:35] spoken word praise the Lord so he spoke
[46:38] things into existence he could say Let
[46:41] There be this and it was by the spoken
[46:44] word and what did John see here he saw a
[46:48] two-edged sword proceeding out of the
[46:50] mouth of he who in the midst of the
[46:52] seven gold candlesticks and what did he
[46:55] say he says I am the first so that
[46:58] implies he is the first he is the one
[47:01] that was in the beginning who created
[47:03] the world by the spoken word praise the
[47:06] Lord so in the beginning was the word
[47:09] and the Word was with God and the Word
[47:11] was God praise the Lord and this same
[47:14] word came out of God as the spoken word
[47:18] to create things into existence it makes
[47:22] him the absolute before him there is
[47:24] none and he says and I am the last it
[47:28] also makes him the absolute that after
[47:30] him there is none praise the Lord so
[47:33] Jesus Christ is our absolute praise the
[47:37] Lord and he
[47:38] says and when I saw him I fell at his
[47:41] feet as dead and he laid his right hand
[47:43] upon me saying fear not I am the first
[47:46] and the last and I am he that liveth and
[47:51] was dead praise the Lord he does not end
[47:55] there because maybe it could bring
[47:57] confusion to say I'm the first and the
[47:59] last but he needed to show that it is he
[48:03] who condescended praise the Lord it is
[48:06] he who created himself a body of Jesus
[48:11] praise the Lord so he came and he left
[48:14] his throne like the scripture tells us
[48:16] in Timothy that God was seen of angels
[48:20] leaving the throne coming down praise
[48:23] the Lord and after he was done with the
[48:26] work the duty of redemption he was again
[48:29] taken up to glory and the angels saw him
[48:32] going up to Glory praise the Lord so he
[48:35] says I am the first and the last and
[48:37] also I am he that liveth and was dead
[48:43] praise the Lord and behold I am alive
[48:46] forever more amen and have the keys of
[48:49] hell and death a clear picture of him he
[48:52] was dead in Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[48:56] he came in the body of Christ and by the
[49:00] spoken word we know that when he wanted
[49:04] things into existence in the beginning
[49:06] he spoke them into existence he spoke
[49:09] the earth into existence he said let
[49:12] there be light and it was like let there
[49:14] be this and there was that praise the
[49:17] Lord And now when he came down when he
[49:21] wanted to redeem us when he wanted to
[49:24] reconcile us from the Fallen rest of
[49:27] Adam the Bible says he sent Gabriel the
[49:31] Angel and he spoke to the Virgin who
[49:35] knew no man praise the Lord and by the
[49:37] spoken word he spoke and she conceived
[49:42] by the spoken word praise the Lord so he
[49:45] has the power to create by the spoken
[49:48] word and when he spoke and says Mary you
[49:51] shall conceive by the Holy Spirit and
[49:55] you shall Pro you shall give PR to his
[49:57] son and he shall call his name Emmanuel
[50:00] meaning god with us so God created
[50:04] himself about in the womb of Mary praise
[50:08] the Lord And now when Jesus comes out
[50:12] praise the Lord And now when he was
[50:14] being baptized we know what the
[50:16] scriptures said when they baptized him
[50:20] what happened there was a voice that
[50:22] came from heaven and says behold my
[50:25] beloved Son in whom I am well beh
[50:27] behoved praise the Lord so now God was
[50:30] confirming that this body here is mine
[50:34] and I dwell in this body praise the Lord
[50:37] so he came to live with us he came to
[50:40] help us he came to fight for us he came
[50:44] to overcome sin on our behalf so the
[50:47] Bible says after that he was taken to
[50:50] Calvary and he died the death upon the
[50:52] cross so he was dead but now here when
[50:56] he speak speaking to John he says I was
[50:58] dead but now I am alive forever more
[51:02] praise the Lord a clear picture of who
[51:05] he is praise the Lord he says I was dead
[51:09] and now I am alive and he says I am
[51:13] everything I am the beginning I am the
[51:15] last I was dead and I'm alive praise the
[51:18] Lord and he
[51:21] says he continues now down the
[51:25] scriptures the word that came out of him
[51:28] the two aged SWAT he sent them out to
[51:32] the Seven Stars he sent it out to the to
[51:35] the messengers to the seven Church ages
[51:39] and when we get down in the Book of
[51:40] Revelations chapter 2 verse one he says
[51:44] when he began to speak he sent specific
[51:48] message remember the Bible says it is he
[51:52] who stands in the midst of the seven
[51:55] gold candlesticks
[51:57] it is he who stands in the midst of the
[52:00] seven Church ages he's in control of the
[52:03] church ages he praise the Lord from the
[52:06] first church age of Ephesus to the last
[52:11] Church age of the aition where we are
[52:13] right now praise the Lord so now he
[52:16] begins to speak to the churches he's
[52:19] trying to reconcile he's calling to he's
[52:22] trying to call a church himself he's
[52:25] trying to prepare the people of every
[52:28] age to receive him praise the Lord so he
[52:31] can reconcile them to himself to direct
[52:34] them to the absolute so he says unto the
[52:38] angel unto the angel of the Church of
[52:41] Ephesus right now he begins to speak
[52:45] these things says he that holdeth the
[52:48] Seven Stars in his right hand who walks
[52:51] in the midst of the seven golden
[52:54] candlesticks he holds
[52:57] the
[52:57] church in his right hand he holds all
[53:01] the Seven Stars in his right hand praise
[53:04] the Lord so that means it is he who sent
[53:08] the Seven Stars it is he who sent the
[53:12] angels to every Church age so every
[53:16] Angel every messenger that came out to
[53:19] speak to the age did not come to speak
[53:21] of himself but they came to speak the
[53:24] word that God had given to them for
[53:26] their age to the first church age he
[53:29] says right these things says he that
[53:32] holdeth the Seven Stars in is right hand
[53:34] who walks in the midst of the golden
[53:37] candlesticks then he goes down to the SK
[53:40] Church in verse 8 and to the Ang of the
[53:43] church in smer right these things says
[53:47] the first and the last and which was
[53:50] dead and is alive he's describing who he
[53:54] is and he goes down
[53:57] in every aspect describing himself as
[54:00] the first and the last before him there
[54:03] is none and after him there is none he
[54:06] is the absolute praise the Lord and now
[54:09] he has absolute power over the church he
[54:13] has absolute authority over the church
[54:16] because the church is in his right hand
[54:19] praise the Lord he directs the church
[54:22] praise the Lord and his ultimate goal is
[54:25] to bring the chge to himself praise the
[54:28] Lord is to point every believer to Jesus
[54:31] Christ that's why every message when
[54:35] Paul was speaking he was directing the
[54:37] people to Jesus Christ and not to
[54:39] himself praise the Lord when we see the
[54:42] message
[54:43] ofam he's not speaking of himself he
[54:47] never pointed people to himself even if
[54:50] wanted to make him an object of worship
[54:52] he rejected it and he opposed it every
[54:55] time he wanted worship him he says he
[54:58] was pointing the people Jesus Christ
[55:01] because it is he who is in control who
[55:03] has authority over the church praise the
[55:06] name of the Living God he says unto the
[55:09] Ang of the church in SM right this
[55:12] things says he the the first and the
[55:15] last which was dead and is alive I Know
[55:19] Thy works and tribulation and poverty
[55:22] but Thou Art Rich he knows the
[55:25] tribulations of that age they struggles
[55:29] in their body and says I know when you
[55:31] get tired of life I know your
[55:34] tribulations I know your weaknesses I
[55:36] know your challenges I know your
[55:38] struggles you call yourself poor and yet
[55:42] you are rich why because he has absolute
[55:46] power praise the Lord not only to
[55:49] control not only to guide but also to
[55:53] supply praise the Lord he says you call
[55:56] yourselves poor but yet you are rich why
[56:00] because I am in the midst I am in
[56:02] control over the church praise the Lord
[56:05] I was dead and yet I am alive and we
[56:09] know that he's alive and he's not alive
[56:11] in the heavens but he's alive and he
[56:14] lives in Us Praise the Lord because we
[56:18] know when we read the Bible in the
[56:20] scriptures when he was here on the third
[56:23] day after he's Resurrected
[56:26] and he was going up to Glory the
[56:28] scripture tells us that when Jesus was
[56:31] still here he made the
[56:34] disciples and then on the last day that
[56:37] he was here on Earth he led them up and
[56:40] when he led them out in the book of of
[56:43] of Luke chapter 24 from around verse 45
[56:46] downwards when he was speaking to them
[56:49] he commissioned them and told them to go
[56:52] and teach but then he told them but
[56:55] first wa wait until I come back praise
[57:00] the Lord he says I have commissioned you
[57:02] to go and teach I have commissioned you
[57:04] to go and direct people to to my to me
[57:06] but first wait why because he says I
[57:10] must make myself known to you that I am
[57:12] alive in you forever more praise the
[57:14] Lord and on the day of Pentecost he came
[57:18] down and when he came down he made
[57:21] himself known to us in the form of the
[57:23] holy spirit that he lives in US praise
[57:26] the Lord so he was dead and is now alive
[57:30] and is's alive in our lives forever more
[57:33] and now here he tells them I know your
[57:35] works I know your tribulation and
[57:37] poverty and I know the
[57:39] blasphemy of them which say that are
[57:42] Jews and are not but are synagogues of
[57:45] Satan fear none of those things which
[57:48] you shall suffer behold the devil shall
[57:50] cast some of you into prison he knows
[57:54] why because he's at the Center of
[57:57] authority he's in the midst of the
[57:59] church he's in our lives he's in the
[58:02] church praise the Lord he's back and he
[58:05] lives in the church and he says I am
[58:08] alive and I know that Satan shall not
[58:11] leave you to go free he shall not leave
[58:14] it to go called free so he shall come
[58:16] and cause
[58:18] tribulation and he shall cast some of
[58:20] into prison and you'll be bound in
[58:23] prison physical prison spiritual prison
[58:26] but he
[58:27] says that you may be tried in the prison
[58:31] of this body we are tried in the prison
[58:35] of this body we go through persecutions
[58:37] and tribulations and trials we go
[58:39] through all the sufferings but he says I
[58:42] know your works and he says you shall
[58:46] have tribulation 10 days but be thou
[58:49] faithful even if it means death be
[58:51] faithful unto death and I'll give thee a
[58:55] Crown of Life
[58:56] be faithful be thou obedient be thou
[59:00] honest I am alive and have control and
[59:04] I'll give you a Crown of Life praise the
[59:06] Lord and in verse says and unto the end
[59:10] of the church in pagamos right these
[59:12] things says he which has the sharp sword
[59:16] with two edges and unto the angel of the
[59:19] church in the right these things says
[59:22] the Son of God who has his eyes like a
[59:26] flame of fire and his feet like fine
[59:29] brass and to the angel in in
[59:31] Philadelphia WR this things say he that
[59:36] is Holy that is true he that has the Key
[59:40] of David he that opens and no man shuts
[59:44] and shuts and no man opens these are all
[59:48] descriptions of who he is that he's in
[59:51] control and exercises control and
[59:54] authority over the church
[59:56] praise the Lord so now the church the
[59:59] one who is in charge of the church is
[1:00:01] not an individual but it is Christ
[1:00:04] himself praise the Lord he's the
[1:00:06] absolute of the church and he says now
[1:00:09] to the
[1:00:11] angel of the Church of lodia right these
[1:00:15] things says the amen amen means finished
[1:00:20] the faithful the true witness the
[1:00:22] beginning of creation of God praise the
[1:00:25] Lord he now comes here and CS it and
[1:00:28] says he is the beginning of the creation
[1:00:31] of God and how when did God start
[1:00:34] creation and how did he create he
[1:00:36] created by the spoken word praise the
[1:00:39] Lord confirming the scriptures John
[1:00:43] chapter 1 verse1 brother you can give it
[1:00:44] to us in the beginning was the word and
[1:00:48] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:00:50] God praise the Lord and next and they
[1:00:53] said the same verse two
[1:00:58] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:01:00] and here the scripture says this Angel
[1:01:04] write these things and when Jesus began
[1:01:07] spoke he says these things sath the amen
[1:01:11] the faithful the true witness the
[1:01:13] beginning of the creation of God and
[1:01:16] here in verse two it says the same was
[1:01:18] in the beginning with God praise the
[1:01:21] Lord so now if the same was in the
[1:01:23] beginning with God and now he say says
[1:01:26] here that in the beginning was the word
[1:01:29] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:01:31] was God himself how did the word become
[1:01:34] God himself when he created the body of
[1:01:37] Jesus Christ praise the Lord he became
[1:01:40] flesh and he became the Living Word
[1:01:43] before the world praise the Lord and now
[1:01:46] he
[1:01:47] says the beginning of the creation of
[1:01:51] God God created the word by Jesus Christ
[1:01:55] Christ the spoken word praise the Lord
[1:01:59] and like we read last week in the Book
[1:02:01] of Revelations chapter 19 we know that
[1:02:06] the Bible calls The Testament of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ and he calls it the word of God
[1:02:11] and which is Christ himself so now he's
[1:02:15] trying to reveal who he was from the
[1:02:18] beginning and now here he CS it up and
[1:02:21] says he was the beginning of the
[1:02:24] creation of God pray praise the name of
[1:02:26] the Living God so now we see that he
[1:02:29] stands in the midst of the seven golden
[1:02:32] candlesticks in the midst of the
[1:02:35] churches and he gives a specific message
[1:02:38] to every Church to the angel Ephesus
[1:02:41] right to the angel at seminar right the
[1:02:44] angel at sis right the angel at
[1:02:46] Philadelphia right the angel at at
[1:02:49] lishia right and each of them we are
[1:02:52] given a message each of them we are
[1:02:55] given the word each of them we given
[1:02:57] instruments each of them we are given
[1:03:00] directions to Point them to the absolute
[1:03:04] Jesus Christ praise the Living God and
[1:03:07] now we see him walking in the midst we
[1:03:11] see him walking in the midst and as he's
[1:03:13] walking the midst he's guiding us he's
[1:03:16] directing us he's teaching us guiding us
[1:03:19] through life teaching us his statutes
[1:03:22] showing us his Mysteries preparing us
[1:03:26] every day he's preparing our hearts he
[1:03:29] says I know your weaknesses but I sit
[1:03:32] because I am alive I see in your life I
[1:03:35] know your weaknesses and I will help you
[1:03:37] to go over them he says I know I know
[1:03:41] your tribulations I know your trials I
[1:03:44] know that thou art weak but Thou Art
[1:03:47] strong because he lives in Us Praise the
[1:03:50] Lord guiding the church every day and
[1:03:53] pointing the church to himself
[1:03:56] Jesus Christ the absolute praise the
[1:03:59] Lord alive in the church forever more
[1:04:02] now the word
[1:04:04] absolute means the
[1:04:06] ultimate means the one that is complete
[1:04:10] it means the one that is final praise
[1:04:14] the Lord the Ultimate Reality of the
[1:04:17] most fundamental being the most
[1:04:19] fundamental
[1:04:21] entity considered Beyond human
[1:04:23] perception or comprehension
[1:04:26] and it represents something
[1:04:28] unconditioned infinite perfect praise
[1:04:32] the Lord timate truth so now when Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ is presented and presenting
[1:04:40] himself as the absolute it means he's
[1:04:44] the ultimate it means above him there is
[1:04:47] none so if above him there is none that
[1:04:51] Jesus because that's what he calls
[1:04:53] himself here and that's what the
[1:04:54] scripture tells us
[1:04:56] he says I am the first and the last a
[1:04:59] revelation of who he is so if he's the
[1:05:02] first and the last that means in the
[1:05:05] beginning it was him and in the end it
[1:05:08] is still him praise the Lord who stands
[1:05:11] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:05:13] candlesticks and
[1:05:15] now through the church he's been
[1:05:19] presenting himself in different forms
[1:05:22] trying to guide the church as the spoken
[1:05:25] word praise the Lord he condescended
[1:05:29] himself and he made himself the word
[1:05:32] praise the Lord like John saw a
[1:05:35] two-edged sword proceeding out of the
[1:05:37] mouth of his mouth and then he begins to
[1:05:40] guide the church by the spoken word he
[1:05:43] begins to teach the church by the spoken
[1:05:46] word he begins to prepare the church by
[1:05:48] the spoken word guiding the church and
[1:05:52] teaching us and preparing us for what
[1:05:54] for that marriage of the lamp praise the
[1:05:58] Lord because that is the capson of it
[1:06:01] each of us our prayer the goal of every
[1:06:05] Christian is everlasting life praise the
[1:06:08] Lord it is not to live a life here a
[1:06:10] holy Life as a Christian but our goal is
[1:06:14] everlasting life praise the Lord and the
[1:06:17] day we become Christians the day we
[1:06:20] become Believers the day we are born
[1:06:23] again and like the Pastor was teaching
[1:06:26] Us in the in the daily
[1:06:29] edifications that that new birth which
[1:06:33] is the day Christ is born in your lives
[1:06:36] the day you receive the Holy Spirit he
[1:06:39] comes to stay praise the Lord he lcks
[1:06:43] himself in he gets through these courts
[1:06:47] from the body to the spirit to the soul
[1:06:50] and when he gets into the soul he locks
[1:06:53] himself in there praise the Lord and
[1:06:55] when he locks himself in there he begins
[1:06:57] now to guide you he the Bible calls him
[1:07:01] the seal until the day of our Redemption
[1:07:05] praise the Lord so now all along the way
[1:07:08] he begins to guide us and to teach us he
[1:07:11] begins to direct us to encourage us in
[1:07:14] our weaknesses and says you are strong
[1:07:18] in your weaknesses you are strong why
[1:07:21] because he that is in US is stronger
[1:07:23] than he that is in the world praise
[1:07:25] praise the Lord and now in Tribulation
[1:07:28] he says I know I know that you'll be
[1:07:30] cast into prison and you'll be tried and
[1:07:34] different trials shall come your way but
[1:07:36] says be thou faithful be thou honest
[1:07:40] hold fast to that which you have
[1:07:43] believed let our eyes let our faith
[1:07:46] always be pointed to the word of of God
[1:07:49] because it is our obsolute Jesus Christ
[1:07:53] he says in those trials and I know he
[1:07:56] will come and he will cast some of you
[1:07:58] into
[1:07:59] prison like the brother was singing some
[1:08:02] through the waters some through the fire
[1:08:06] some through great sorrow he will cast
[1:08:08] us into different prisons but even in
[1:08:11] those prisons he says I am present with
[1:08:14] you why because he lives in Us Praise
[1:08:18] the Lord to give us strength for the
[1:08:21] season praise the Lord in that second
[1:08:24] Church age when the church was taken
[1:08:27] into the dark edges when the church the
[1:08:30] Believers the Disciples of Jesus Christ
[1:08:33] were persecuted some of them were killed
[1:08:37] praise the Lord like I told you what the
[1:08:39] prophet was saying about a certain man
[1:08:41] who wrot and says but where was God in
[1:08:44] that time he said I was there with you I
[1:08:48] know that the devil will cast you into
[1:08:50] prison and you may think that you are
[1:08:52] poor and your strength is low but you
[1:08:55] are are strong because I am with you he
[1:08:58] was with them in Dark Ages even when
[1:09:01] they killed them his grace was
[1:09:03] sufficient for them in that day praise
[1:09:06] the Lord that's why he gave them the
[1:09:08] grace some of them saw the fire the fire
[1:09:12] was set and they asked them to denounce
[1:09:15] Jesus Christ and they never denounced he
[1:09:18] gave them the grace to have the courage
[1:09:20] to enter into the fire praise the Lord
[1:09:23] he was present with them praise the Lord
[1:09:27] that time he could not save them all
[1:09:29] from the fire though he had the capacity
[1:09:32] to do it we have seen him save so many
[1:09:35] from the fire we have seen the Hebrew
[1:09:37] children when Nebuchadnezzar laid the
[1:09:40] fire the furnace and because they had
[1:09:43] refused to Bow Down and Worship his God
[1:09:45] the the the golden image that he had
[1:09:47] made and because they refused to worship
[1:09:50] the image and they set the fire and God
[1:09:54] came down and save those children from
[1:09:56] the fire but in the Dark Ages he could
[1:09:59] allow them to get into the fire and they
[1:10:02] could be consumed by the fire because
[1:10:04] that's the grace that he supplied for
[1:10:06] them in their day praise the Lord that
[1:10:09] why he says I know some of you shall be
[1:10:11] cast to prison some of you shall be cast
[1:10:14] to the fire but my grace is always
[1:10:17] present with you praise the Lord in the
[1:10:19] fire he's present with us in the floods
[1:10:22] he's present with us in great Sorrows
[1:10:24] he's present present with us in our
[1:10:26] weaknesses he's present with us he is
[1:10:29] the absolute because he has the control
[1:10:31] over the church praise the Lord and you
[1:10:34] know there's a time when H he gave a
[1:10:37] vision the vision to to Ezekiel the
[1:10:41] vision of the bones and he showed him
[1:10:44] the he carried him into the spirit in a
[1:10:46] vision and now he took him to the valley
[1:10:49] and began showing him the the dry bones
[1:10:52] praise the Lord and now he want he
[1:10:55] showed him that there was power in the
[1:10:58] spoken word he told
[1:11:01] Ezekiel speak to the bones he first
[1:11:04] asked him in verse three we can find
[1:11:06] that in Ezekiel chapter 37 and now he
[1:11:09] said son of man can these bones have
[1:11:13] life again but because Ezekiel was a
[1:11:17] prophet he looked at himself and says I
[1:11:19] am just a man and my faith faints he
[1:11:23] says it's only you who knows because you
[1:11:27] are the absolute you know from the
[1:11:29] beginning to the end it is you who knows
[1:11:32] what is going to happen tomorrow because
[1:11:34] you have planned everything he says it
[1:11:37] is you who knows praise the Lord and he
[1:11:40] says now speak to the bones and in verse
[1:11:44] four he says again he said unto me
[1:11:47] prophesy unto these bones and say unto
[1:11:49] them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of
[1:11:52] the Lord thus says the Lord God
[1:11:55] unto these bones behold I will cause
[1:11:59] breath to enter into you and you shall
[1:12:02] live he speaking to the dry
[1:12:05] bones the bones were there maybe the
[1:12:08] people had died and you know there were
[1:12:10] sculls scattered by the power of the
[1:12:12] spoken word he said speak to these bones
[1:12:16] speak to these bones the spoken word was
[1:12:20] given to him the two-edged sword that
[1:12:23] proceeds out of his mouth the that
[1:12:25] teaches and guides the church through
[1:12:27] all truth because he says when the
[1:12:30] comforter comes in other words when I
[1:12:32] come I shall guide you through all
[1:12:35] Truth by the Spoken Word by nothing else
[1:12:39] but by the spoken word praise the Lord
[1:12:41] he says prophesy unto these bones behold
[1:12:44] I'll cause breath to enter into you and
[1:12:47] he shall live and I will L SS upon you
[1:12:52] and will bring up flesh upon you and
[1:12:54] cover you with skin and put breath in

[1:13:09] if he lives in us the word of God lives
[1:13:12] in us he says by the power of the word
[1:13:15] speak to those bones so if that God had
[1:13:19] the power to speak to the bones to give
[1:13:22] them life he has the power to speak to
[1:13:26] us to speak through our challenges to
[1:13:28] speak through our weaknesses to give us
[1:13:31] strength for the day praise the Lord he
[1:13:33] has the power to teach us his word to
[1:13:36] teach us his statutes to help guide us

[1:13:46] so I prophesied as I was commanded he
[1:13:50] was a prophet be obedient be faithful to
[1:13:54] the end

[1:13:58] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[1:14:00] a noise and behold a shaking and Bones
[1:14:04] came together Bor to his bone and when I
[1:14:07] beheld L the snils and the flesh came up
[1:14:10] came up upon them and the skin covered
[1:14:14] them above and there was no breath in
[1:14:16] them then said he unto me prophesy unto
[1:14:20] the wind prophesy son of man and said to
[1:14:23] the wind thus says the Lord God come
[1:14:26] from the Four Winds or breath and
[1:14:28] breathe upon this Lane this Lane that
[1:14:33] may live so I prophesied as he commanded
[1:14:36] me and the breath came into them and
[1:14:39] they lived and stood up upon their feet

[1:21:25] relieve the oppressed judge the
[1:21:27] fatherless plead for the Widow come now
[1:21:31] let us reason together says the Lord
[1:21:34] though your sins be as Scarlet they
[1:21:36] shall be as white as snow though they be
[1:21:40] red like Crimson they shall be as wool a
[1:21:43] forgiving God praise the Lord very rich
[1:21:46] in Mercy praise the Lord thus why the
[1:21:49] says his mercies are new every
[1:21:52] morning and they endure forever
[1:21:55] the mercies of God are still present for
[1:21:57] the church come turn away from sin why
[1:22:02] he says I it is I who was
[1:22:06] dead and now I am alive his blood when
[1:22:10] he died he let his blood start flowing
[1:22:14] to cleanse the church to cleanse every
[1:22:16] sinner to cleanse us from our weaknesses
[1:22:19] to cleanse us from our Sports to cleanse
[1:22:21] all iniquity his blood is still flesh
[1:22:24] bleeding for us praise the Lord he says
[1:22:27] come the blood is still flesh wash
[1:22:31] yourself daily in the blood wash
[1:22:34] yourself daily in the blood because the
[1:22:36] blood is still sufficient he knows we
[1:22:40] fail and we become weak and our faith
[1:22:42] faint but he is a very just God that he
[1:22:46] has given us away Jesus Christ God is
[1:22:50] provided way for the church that we can
[1:22:52] be reconciled every other moment moment
[1:22:55] to himself praise the name of the Living
[1:22:57] God and that settles it the prophet says
[1:23:01] that settles it it is the amen it is the
[1:23:05] absolute it is the ultimate when Jesus
[1:23:08] says ask the father anything in my name
[1:23:11] why because he is the absolute ask
[1:23:14] anything in his name I'll Grant it now
[1:23:18] that's an absolute that's an ultimate
[1:23:21] that is it whatever you ask whatever
[1:23:24] have need of When you pray believe that
[1:23:26] you receive it you shall have it that
[1:23:29] settles it that's all of it see if we
[1:23:33] are really anchored and receive it we've
[1:23:36] made him our absolute because he does he
[1:23:40] is the absolute that takes us from all
[1:23:44] fear there is no fear when you are
[1:23:47] really tied to the Rock of Ages there is
[1:23:50] no fear when you are tied to the word of
[1:23:53] God it is the Rock of Ages Calamity May
[1:23:56] strike but you are anchored in the Rock
[1:23:59] of Ages challenges waves may come but
[1:24:03] you anchored in the Rock of Ages because
[1:24:06] he is the absolute then he said in
[1:24:08] paragraph 96 if you abide in me he he is
[1:24:12] the word my words is abiding in you you
[1:24:15] can ask what you will I know it then if
[1:24:19] Christianity was the word of God and he
[1:24:22] was the word and by accepting the word
[1:24:25] the word lived through him then I know
[1:24:28] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:24:31] ask what you will if you are in the word
[1:24:35] and are part of the word you'll only ask
[1:24:38] that what the word tells you to ask know
[1:24:42] the day you are living then ask
[1:24:45] accordingly he says if you are in the
[1:24:47] word you will know the will of the
[1:24:49] father and you not ask things outside
[1:24:52] his will because you know his will so
[1:24:55] you'll ask things within his will and
[1:24:57] whatever you ask in his name he shall
[1:25:00] provide praise the Lord and says in the
[1:25:05] message spiritual food in Du season
[1:25:08] Jeffersonville 1965 is like a l of old s
[1:25:12] if God be God then serve him if Jesus is
[1:25:15] the center of all things to the
[1:25:17] Christian then I think we ought to let
[1:25:20] loose of everything else and cleave to
[1:25:23] him if he's the center of your
[1:25:26] everything then you ought to Lo leave
[1:25:29] everything lose and cleave to him why
[1:25:32] because you recognize he's your absolute
[1:25:35] remember he is the center he is the
[1:25:37] North Star he is the ultimate he is the
[1:25:40] absolute and if it's the North Star
[1:25:43] there is only one thing that will point
[1:25:45] to the north star that's your compass
[1:25:47] that your sailing with and the campass
[1:25:50] that I'm trying you to sail with is the
[1:25:53] word of God
[1:25:54] and the word always points you to him
[1:25:57] Jesus Christ Our obsolute Praise the
[1:26:00] Lord and in the message partos Vision
[1:26:04] 1949 and I turned to see quoting
[1:26:07] Revelations 1:2 of where we read and I
[1:26:10] turned to see the voice that spoke with
[1:26:12] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:26:15] candlesticks John does not say that he
[1:26:18] turned to see the one whose voice he
[1:26:20] heard but he turned to see The Voice
[1:26:24] oh I like that he turned to see the
[1:26:27] voice the voice and the person are one
[1:26:30] and the same Jesus is the word when John
[1:26:33] turned to see he turned to see the voice
[1:26:36] but when he turned to see The Voice he
[1:26:38] saw one like the son of man he saw Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ so Jesus and the word are one the
[1:26:45] absolute praise the Lord so the absolute
[1:26:48] and the spoken word the voice that came
[1:26:51] out of him are one and he says
[1:26:54] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:26:57] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:26:59] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:27:01] and all things were created by Him and
[1:27:04] without him was not anything made that
[1:27:06] was made if you can ever get to really
[1:27:09] see the word you'll be seeing Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ because when John turned to see
[1:27:16] he never said I turn to see the man but
[1:27:18] he turned to see the voice that spoke to
[1:27:20] him and when he turned to see what did
[1:27:23] he see one like the son of man praise
[1:27:26] the Lord but remember when he saw he saw
[1:27:29] a two-edged sword proceeding out of his
[1:27:32] mouth the spoken word so the spoken word
[1:27:36] and Jesus Christ are one and Jesus
[1:27:39] Christ is our absolute so if Jesus
[1:27:41] Christ Our absolute that absolute is
[1:27:44] alive in our lives if the absolute the
[1:27:48] ultimate is alive in our lives he says
[1:27:51] ask anything in my name and it shall be
[1:27:53] given unto you so that absolute and the
[1:27:57] spoken word are alive in our lives to
[1:28:00] guide us every day to teach us his
[1:28:03] statutes to guide us along this walk to
[1:28:06] show us our paths to show us our
[1:28:10] weaknesses and also help us to come out
[1:28:13] of them because by his word through the
[1:28:16] word we get to know our
[1:28:18] weaknesses but again he GES us through
[1:28:21] our weaknesses to himself he is a
[1:28:24] gracious God he is a merciful god praise
[1:28:27] the Lord and his grace is here with us
[1:28:31] to guide us through this journey and his
[1:28:34] ultimate goal is to see the church in
[1:28:36] the Rapture his goal is to see the
[1:28:39] bright on the wedding on the wedding
[1:28:42] supper so he's preparing us by his
[1:28:44] spoken word every day through the
[1:28:47] message of the hour through the word
[1:28:50] through the teacher teachings of the
[1:28:52] Prophet through the teachings of the
[1:28:54] ministers teaching us and preparing us
[1:28:57] for the wedding supper that is the
[1:28:59] ultimate purpose of Jesus Christ Our
[1:29:02] absolute may God bless
[1:29:04] you amen we
[1:29:09] make amen let's get on our feet as
[1:29:11] brother Moses leads us into
[1:29:14] worship amen he's here to guide us and
[1:29:17] his grace is sufficient for us praise
[1:29:20] the Lord he will guide us he has not
[1:29:23] saved us to lose us he has not given us
[1:29:27] his Spirit to lose us he he's been made
[1:29:31] he has been born in us to guide us until
[1:29:34] the day of our Redemption so through our
[1:29:36] weaknesses let's look at the ultimate
[1:29:40] let's look at the absolute Jesus Christ
[1:29:43] praise the Lord I know your weaknesses I
[1:29:46] know your works I know that you cannot
[1:29:49] bear those that are evil he says in
[1:29:51] every age I know I know I know and if he
[1:29:54] gave Grace to this to the church
[1:29:58] age if he gave Grace to smina in the
[1:30:01] Dark Ages and they pointed to the fire
[1:30:05] and they moved through the fire they
[1:30:07] were killed and never denounced Jesus
[1:30:09] Christ if some of them were cut a s and
[1:30:12] they never denounced but he gave them
[1:30:15] that Grace to Bear the pain for the word
[1:30:18] for the word for the sake of the word he
[1:30:20] shall give us the grace in this journey
[1:30:23] that we are leading praise the Lord he
[1:30:25] shall give us grace through our
[1:30:27] weaknesses he shall give us Grace to
[1:30:29] overcome all the trials and persecutions
[1:30:33] that may lay in our journey because he
[1:30:35] is a gracious God who is in control over
[1:30:38] the church and he does not only guide us
[1:30:42] but he says you know that you think you
[1:30:45] are rich you are poor but yet you are
[1:30:47] rich he supplies and shall supply for
