Revelation 10 7. the Bible says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angels the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so he says in the days there's seven churches had seven angels Angel is the messenger like when you read in Revelations every church with a message which is the church and this messenger here the Bible says and now this seventh thing is meant to reveal now let us go to Matthew chapter 17. and then verse 11. let us start from verse 10. so the scripture says and these disciples asked him saying why then said the secrets that Elias must first come in you know they were asking Jesus why does the scripture say that Elijah how did Jesus answer them in verse 11. and Jesus answered and said unto them [Music] truly shall fast cars is giving a prophecy that Elijah has to first now when you look at the ministry of John the baptism for him we started a new way he started a new way [Applause] he started with he's the one who started baptism is the one that declared Jesus Christ was not restoring but was starting something new but here Jesus started a new way the truth that has been lost so he comes and restores [Applause] and this is the day that we are living praise the name of Allah so God has sent us a prophet in our generation called William married [Music] foreign [Applause] in 1946 last time we talked about the seven Visions how God showed him that Muslim is going to attack it is that was the first Vision God showed him this Vision in 1933 praise the name of Allah that Muslims would invade Ethiopia and then Ethiopia would fall at these steps that was fulfilled then the second Vision God showed him Idol of Hitler how it would rise up and bring the whole world and that was fulfilled God showed him in 1933 and these things came fulfilled one by one then the third division how the world [Applause] [Music] economy concerning our differences in science until brother saw a bubble like a car like an egg and nobody was driving it now in 1933 when he was speaking this yeah the technology was so remote technology that many things in the car we have now we are not there you know those days but now he's talking that people will sit in the car no steering the guy is just moving in 1933 and then you look now that has been foreign [Music] foreign foreign Ohio a voice saying as John the Baptista was sent foreign foreign to preach many sermons that restores your face always to the Bible face the name of Allah he preached about the seven Church ages and when he was preaching the last service about the seven churches the amount of light in them I don't know if you have that chapter then when he had finished a hand Came From Heaven started drawing from the church of Ephesus from the first church of the seventh church we have the seven churches so God's confirming that there's seven churches which have been preached according to the word of God then in 1963 God told him to go and preach the Seven Seals [Music] every morning you're getting it so the message that we have restores us between back and yeah so we have a message try to know about that at this end time that God has sent to our gender foreign when he was preaching in 1965. in January on 24th he was preaching in the International Convention of the Full Gospel businessman in Phoenix Arizona Phoenix and now brother Branham was going to preach the message on the birth pains and he was taking his text from John chapter 16. verse 21 to verse 22. it was a Sunday right it was Sunday now his wife had given him a new Bible so when brother Branham was opening his Bible the pages there they were not showing John 16 21. and he was troubled yeah yeah I want to read John 16 20. The Bible Pages were not okay there was an Archbishop of the Catholic Church who is called the most Reverend John Stanley whatever land you understand so he came yeah because he was on the platform he came with this Bible here and he gave it to him and when he gave him he told him use it and then he said there is a reason why it was done and you know it and God will show you something to bring out of this that's what the the Archbishop told him so later that foreign and then he started wondering then the moment he had good that the pages were stuck and able to open them a voice spoke to him as clear as a voice speaking to you hello and referred him to Luke Chapter 4. I started reading from verse 16 to verse 22. the voice was speaking that was the spirit of God and the voice it was also revealed to him Isaiah 61. let us go to Isaiah chapter 61 and verse 1 and 2. foreign the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptoria of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of Our Lord to comfort all that money is where he was brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to it and there was delivered unto him the book of prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written in the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the liver into the captives and recovering of sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised now he read Isaiah 61. and then verse Luke 4 19 to preach the acceptoria of the Lord he was reading Isaiah chapter 61. but Jesus when he was reading Isaiah chapter 61 verse 2. he stopped in the middle yeah [Music] [Music] in our generation but he took him there I am [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Elijah the prophet all the mysteries of God have been revealed let us go to Daniel chapter 12. praise the name of us I just want to finish actually to end of my reason Daniel chapter 12. and then verse 4 but though Daniel shut up the world even to the time of the end many shall run to and flow acknowledge shall increase has knowledge increase
