[14:30] whatever his presence
[14:32] is there is a Lely
[14:36] message praise the
[14:38] Lord W let's open the
[14:48] word let's go to the Book of
[14:52] John St John
[14:56] 14 and verse
[15:08] St joh
[15:14] 1421 uh the Bible
[15:20] says at that day the Bible says John
[15:25] 1421
[15:29] he that has my
[15:33] Commandments and keepeth them
[15:40] and he it is that loveth
[15:46] me and he he that loveth me shall be
[15:50] loved of my
[15:53] father and I will love
[15:56] him and will manifest myself to
[16:01] him now let's notice
[16:04] Jesus is
[16:06] saying
[16:08] and will manifest myself to
[16:12] him praise the
[16:14] Lord
[16:16] who praise the Lord Judas said unto
[16:21] him
[16:23] notot Lord how is it that thou wi man
[16:29] EST thyself unto us and not unto the
[16:41] world praise the
[16:50] Lord he said Jesus answered unto them
[16:54] unto him that is Judas if a man loves me
[16:59] he will keep my words and my father will
[17:03] love him and we will come unto him and
[17:07] make our AB with
[17:24] him praise the
[17:27] Lord the Lord add a blessing
[17:31] reading let's pray father Lord want
[17:35] thank you for this
[17:38] evening priv to be in the house of
[17:42] God who are we
[17:46] God the grace that is show unto us
[17:50] Lord we' come it has lead us all our
[17:54] ways to the
[17:56] church in your presence
[17:59] father come and speak to
[18:02] us in moments of
[18:06] weakness Lord give us the grace to be
[18:12] comforted anoint your
[18:14] word I don't know what is the
[18:16] expectation of your
[18:19] children but Lord come and speak to them
[18:23] Lord that at the end of the day the
[18:27] glory may come back to you
[18:30] Love You Lord we appreciate you in the
[18:33] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[18:35] we
[18:37] pray
[18:38] amen may be
[18:42] seated praise
[18:45] God Jesus was told
[18:49] asked how will
[18:52] thou manifest yourself unto
[18:56] us and not to the world
[19:00] praise the Lord in other
[19:04] words how are you going to make
[19:07] it because these
[19:10] people they have
[19:13] sight they are going to see
[19:17] it how will you do
[19:19] it that you manifest yourself to
[19:23] us and they are not
[19:26] seeing because when some someone sees
[19:30] of course he has to understand he know
[19:34] is that
[19:35] right when I
[19:37] sayon I
[19:40] know praise the Lord like when I'm
[19:44] blind if I I I don't know I'm
[19:56] iise the Lord but if I have
[20:00] sight I will know so Judas was
[20:06] wondering Jesus how will it be that thou
[20:12] will manifest thyself unto
[20:15] us and not to the
[20:18] world because
[20:20] 21 Jesus himself started mentioning
[20:26] manifesting I will love
[20:30] will manest myself to
[20:32] him praise the Lord Judas
[20:36] asked how will that be because wherever
[20:40] you are mudes of
[20:43] people praise the Lord and they
[20:47] have and they will see that
[20:52] manifesting how will it be praise the
[20:56] Lord may the Lord give us bre
[21:00] to go through
[21:03] thison praise the
[21:07] Lord the
[21:10] Lord knows how he does
[21:13] things praise the Lord sometimes it's
[21:17] past our
[21:21] knowledge praise the Lord one example I
[21:24] can
[21:27] give Daniel
[21:30] never
[21:31] knew whether he will have life after
[21:37] there is that
[21:39] right but God
[21:42] planed that he there
[21:45] down am and he made sure the lions are
[21:50] too
[21:53] hry the
[21:55] Lord so sometimes
[21:58] the ways of
[22:00] God p man is
[22:03] understanding on the other hand we may
[22:06] even fight
[22:09] his the one
[22:12] person the mother of the parents of
[22:17] Samson they were
[22:22] fighting Samson saw a woman for marriage
[22:28] he saw a woman for
[22:30] marriage and then he forced them
[22:35] parents get her for
[22:38] me but then this woman was of a
[22:42] Philistine
[22:47] side raised
[22:52] to
[22:54] sometimes the parents were right
[22:57] according to the word
[23:00] the manest word of
[23:03] God was on
[23:06] another so what happened on when they
[23:10] said okay let's
[23:12] go on going God
[23:16] Madeon
[23:18] comes
[23:20] why God was trying to
[23:23] see is the strength of Samson grown
[23:29] praise the Lord and when it was grown
[23:32] they went there but when if your Bible
[23:37] readers that was the way of God for him
[23:40] to go there because God was looking for
[23:44] how to attack
[23:46] phis so the only way was to
[23:50] First bring her problem to
[23:56] Samson whereby somebody has to
[23:59] make his heart feel to kill
[24:03] them praise the
[24:05] Lord what I want to say that
[24:08] sometimes
[24:10] ways they our
[24:13] understand what helps us is
[24:17] if is
[24:20] if what helps us to know God
[24:26] ways the ways is
[24:30] manifested praise the Lord and the word
[24:34] manifesting means to show
[24:38] clear in the
[24:40] eyes sometimes in the mind sometimes in
[24:46] demonstrations or
[24:48] appear praise the Lord one another
[24:52] thing the fire
[24:55] fers who knew that they would become
[24:58] Fourth Man
[25:02] In Praise the Lord
[25:05] but praise the Lord made the three
[25:09] Hebrews to enter
[25:14] there the Lord unless the word was
[25:18] thoroughly manifested to
[25:21] them God can never forsake his
[25:25] children praise the Lord
[25:29] now these men in times of Jesus Jesus
[25:34] tells
[25:36] them he said verse 21 he who has my
[25:41] Commandments
[25:43] them praise the
[25:45] Lord
[25:47] and He it is that loves
[25:51] me praise the Lord
[25:56] now one thing is
[26:00] may God help us that we may not be
[26:05] disobedient to the manifested
[26:08] word praise the Lord otherwise there is
[26:12] no another way there's not
[26:16] way
[26:18] works
[26:20] unless manifested to
[26:23] Us Praise the Lord he has to manifest to
[26:27] us
[26:29] you may know him believe him and accept
[26:33] him make him
[26:36] inside over our
[26:38] hearts
[26:40] that so that he is the ruler of our
[26:46] life praise the Lord the only way to do
[26:50] it
[26:52] manifested praise the Lord now today
[26:59] people are looking for
[27:01] Jesus until I was listening to a
[27:05] song in pcal
[27:08] church
[27:11] that they
[27:22] song what does that
[27:24] mean that there's no one like Jesus
[27:26] right
[27:29] there's no God Like
[27:31] Jesus but
[27:33] now when you preach to them Jesus
[27:37] as if you preach to them Jesus as
[27:42] God you may find empty
[27:50] Des they bringing it
[27:54] right praise the
[27:56] lord it's
[27:59] he is manifested to
[28:03] us be
[28:05] like how how will you do
[28:08] it praise the Lord because
[28:12] man the way man is
[28:17] cre God gave him the ideas of
[28:22] things on how he can really of how he
[28:27] can
[28:30] discover many
[28:32] things praise the
[28:35] Lord praise the
[28:39] Lord but you
[28:42] see sometimes we take the wrong
[28:46] trend of
[28:48] discoveries praise the Lord and
[28:52] yet our
[28:55] Discovery our discoveries
[29:00] they all in the
[29:01] Bible is that right but sometimes we
[29:05] take a lot of
[29:07] time to do many other
[29:10] things which may not
[29:12] help the praise the
[29:16] Lord now Jesus how will you
[29:21] manifest praise the Lord how would you
[29:25] manifest yourself unto us and not to the
[29:28] world prise the lord and not to the
[29:32] world Amen what I want to do I want to
[29:37] tell you that Jesus will never
[29:43] come if you don't love
[29:47] him praise the Lord he will never come
[29:50] to man you don't love
[29:53] him praise the
[29:56] Lord amen amen he will never otherwise
[30:01] things will go
[30:02] wrong prise the Lord things will go
[30:06] wrong amen so one thing I want to
[30:16] do praise the Lord that is it so
[30:20] now Jesus said if you love
[30:23] me you will keep my
[30:26] Commandments now
[30:28] what are the Commandments of
[30:32] God and what is the word which is
[30:35] manifested so that we can pick the
[30:37] Commandments of
[30:41] God Amen now Jesus
[30:46] said if you love me you keep my
[30:49] Commandments but let me first bring
[30:53] the you know the bride and Christ
[30:58] praise the Lord the bride and
[31:00] Christ
[31:03] now in the
[31:06] beginning if you want to understand the
[31:08] bride of
[31:10] Christ first look
[31:12] at
[31:15] praise the
[31:17] first was given the
[31:20] word and it was
[31:23] manifested praise the Lord the tree was
[31:27] there
[31:30] praise the Lord what to do don't touch
[31:35] don't
[31:39] eat
[31:43] faed the word is
[31:45] manifested and she failed
[31:48] why one reason she was walking
[31:55] alone sometimes
[31:57] told
[31:59] her you
[32:03] have praise the Lord but now given the
[32:08] word with the
[32:14] word praise the Lord in other words
[32:18] where is the
[32:21] protector the Lord she was
[32:24] walking where was The Protector
[32:28] praise the
[32:31] Lord because Jesus said verse 23 if
[32:36] loves me if anyone loves me he will keep
[32:40] my words my father will love
[32:43] him
[32:47] come we will come if you have the
[32:51] word that is
[32:53] good but don't accept to walk
[33:01] amen if you walk alone there are so many
[33:06] reasonings there are so many things that
[33:10] can make you even doubt what you have
[33:15] H praise the
[33:18] Lord had the word when she met the
[33:22] eny she evened the
[33:25] word but the thing is
[33:28] where was the
[33:30] head praise the Lord where
[33:34] wasam in other words she was
[33:38] satisfied with what she has and
[33:42] forgot her
[33:44] protection
[33:46] was after after
[33:50] allam the word and did it well
[33:55] manifested it to Eve
[33:59] praise the Lord to
[34:01] us God is so gracious that he gave us
[34:05] the
[34:06] word through the
[34:08] prophet is that
[34:10] right when he gave us the word through
[34:14] the prophet what does he expect of
[34:19] us that you keep
[34:21] it praise the Lord and when you keep it
[34:25] he has to come if he doesn't come Never
[34:30] Walk Don't
[34:33] Walk is that right the
[34:37] firstam had the word and it to
[34:41] Eve being excited with the
[34:46] truth but I wish had
[34:51] held and they were walking with
[34:53] Adam devil have not
[35:04] praise the Lord but since he was
[35:08] alone
[35:10] what praise the Lord so
[35:13] therefore the first Eve the
[35:19] bright reason she had the word was
[35:23] walking
[35:24] around yet it was manifested
[35:28] here when it is
[35:30] manifested God has to
[35:34] come praise the Lord so come to us now
[35:39] we are the bride of
[35:40] Christ praise the lord we are the bride
[35:43] of
[35:44] Christ isn't it now brother says when
[35:49] Eve went away from the
[35:52] word she went away from her
[35:59] that's what the prophet says she went
[36:02] away
[36:04] from that means she went away from
[36:09] protection and when she went from
[36:12] protection enemy came the enemy
[36:16] came praise the Lord one day Jesus was
[36:21] in the wilderness
[36:23] alone
[36:26] the is that right
[36:28] is that right when Jesus was walking Al
[36:33] in the
[36:34] wilderness the Bible says Satan
[36:39] came so both parties both
[36:44] parties have to be one
[36:48] in the
[36:50] enemy
[36:52] praise
[36:54] Lord today
[36:57] sent us the
[36:59] word through the prophet and this word
[37:03] is
[37:04] meant connect us to
[37:08] the Jesus Christ so he wrote lovely
[37:12] letters
[37:14] us the prophet to bring to
[37:17] us sometimes we are so
[37:24] busy let me speak this but with
[37:30] the
[37:31] Lord
[37:33] sometimes young
[37:38] Brothers we do things out
[37:43] alone you write a lovely letter to a
[37:48] girl some girls are
[37:51] excited
[37:53] others they read
[37:56] it and they ignore okay they don't take
[38:00] their mind
[38:01] there praise the Lord you never know
[38:06] sometimes God s his
[38:09] letters to us but
[38:13] unfortunately the
[38:20] bride the bride sometimes tends to
[38:24] ignore
[38:26] them praise
[38:28] but Jesus said he will send the
[38:34] Comfort to remind us of those L
[38:40] letters of the things he
[38:42] spoken he will always remind
[38:45] us I love you
[38:47] my he calls
[38:50] youde he always remind us how does he
[38:54] remind us when someone has led School
[38:59] then
[39:05] provides somebody sick
[39:10] ands isn't
[39:12] that someone is dying in
[39:15] sin and God dies on the
[39:18] cross
[39:20] that praise the Lord but sometimes
[39:24] we we tend
[39:27] to
[39:31] Slumber but we forget the lovely letter
[39:34] of
[39:36] Christ even in
[39:39] that still there is another option the
[39:44] Holy Spirit has always reminded us How
[39:48] He Loves
[39:49] Us Praise the Lord so now as the Bri
[39:54] [Music]
[39:57] Christ the bridegroom has always
[40:01] desired to make us loved of
[40:06] him how by making
[40:11] us
[40:12] [Music]
[40:14] off from the worldly
[40:16] things that he doesn't
[40:19] like praise the
[40:21] Lord look at Esther eser es no one she
[40:27] would even be a
[40:29] queen yeah that is
[40:32] right after all she was not of the
[40:38] rest everyone was against that
[40:41] rest watch the grace of
[40:45] God through the wisdom of of
[40:51] mod
[40:53] told hide your identity
[40:57] that's why she was given a name of
[41:02] Esther these are
[41:05] Babylonians
[41:09] but
[41:10] is Hebrew
[41:12] name and that was the name of
[41:15] Esther if she had presented that name
[41:18] before the king before the
[41:23] chamin I think she would not even see
[41:26] the king
[41:28] because those
[41:31] pares they
[41:34] were but she hide the
[41:38] ID and the name
[41:40] means beauty is
[41:44] hidden
[41:46] Lord praise the Lord so es who
[41:50] represents the
[41:52] bride
[41:53] sometimes we may look funny
[42:02] before the
[42:04] world and the truth we look
[42:09] F because the
[42:12] word cut of anything that is to
[42:19] God you know some kind of these
[42:24] trousers praise the Lord
[42:27] people this is the
[42:30] trend praise the Lord others they make
[42:35] SCS or
[42:36] something and when they move on the
[42:40] street even though you're
[42:46] Prophet but I want to tell you
[42:50] this helps us that
[42:57] but now to those
[43:00] people now look at
[43:04] this dring like
[43:09] this human the of
[43:14] Shaving you are still
[43:17] old all those cuts them
[43:22] off you look
[43:24] funny the bridegroom
[43:27] that's the way he wants you to
[43:29] be praise the Lord one day when you are
[43:34] presented
[43:41] before Lord but to us when the word is
[43:47] given we tend to
[43:50] Slumber are the lovely letters of
[43:53] Christ so anyone who loves the bride
[43:59] keep his
[44:02] what praise the Lord now the word as I
[44:06] said
[44:08] manifest means Clear View
[44:13] something something that
[44:16] Isen praise the Lord but now how was it
[44:21] going to be different from the way the
[44:23] believer sees it and the world
[44:28] because it was meant to be
[44:30] different praise the Lord the bride is
[44:34] looking forward for the
[44:36] Rapture is that right but I want to tell
[44:40] you this the Rapture
[44:44] started do you believe that I want to
[44:47] say this
[44:49] quote I'm not speaking for
[44:51] myself the started
[44:57] in the
[44:59] message Christ is the mystery of God
[45:04] revealed he says he
[45:08] [Music]
[45:13] opened he
[45:17] opened and
[45:20] took of his
[45:22] flesh I want to see that
[45:25] quote so don't
[45:27] forget the
[45:29] Rapture
[45:31] started the people were waiting for
[45:34] it it
[45:37] started the Lord have you seen
[45:41] it he opened Adam's
[45:46] s took part of his
[45:50] flesh which was Adam
[45:58] the message Christ is the mystery of
[46:02] God so that's what I'm saying the bride
[46:06] of Christ if we are waiting for the
[46:10] rupture it
[46:12] started praise the Lord it is
[46:15] on the truth is let God be
[46:19] gracious that he manifests it to
[46:24] us praise the Lord
[46:27] I want to say that
[46:29] quote to confirm what I'm saying so that
[46:33] is how God wants us to
[46:35] be
[46:37] is let us live by his
[46:42] word okay you trying another
[46:45] thing the message says and to be
[46:53] surea thata
[46:55] [Music]
[46:57] the whole Rapture
[47:02] now praise the Lord the prophet
[47:06] says and to be
[47:09] sure that the whole rupture
[47:15] now was
[47:18] a praise the Lord so when did it
[47:22] start you can help me to see here
[47:27] to be sure that the whole
[47:35] rupture praise the
[47:37] Lord was
[47:40] a was
[47:41] a prophets were a
[47:44] part if they were
[47:46] not praise the Lord just in Revelation
[47:50] that they was walking
[47:53] up they were making up the
[47:57] body maybe one was making
[48:03] the maybe the
[48:06] toes maybe the arms and so for until the
[48:11] head which we get in the few
[48:14] minutes that makes the entire
[48:18] rupt has it
[48:21] started I want to see the church has the
[48:25] started Ed the only way let God be
[48:30] merciful
[48:32] and to help us see
[48:34] this this one those people with
[48:37] motorcycles
[48:39] outside they don't see
[48:43] it no one will see it because started
[48:47] long
[48:49] ago where is it it's
[48:54] now started
[48:58] wle prophets praise the Lord so that's
[49:02] how it
[49:03] started but now God in his
[49:08] mind in his mind he had a
[49:13] mystery which he called a great
[49:17] mystery praise the Lord because in the
[49:20] firstam god opened the
[49:22] side and of the side on the side
[49:28] Eve came
[49:29] out even to
[49:32] us this is when I think I call it when
[49:35] it
[49:36] started because even on the cross Jesus
[49:40] was dying and when he gave
[49:43] the something came from the
[49:46] side water blood is that right he was
[49:52] forming the bride for himself and when
[49:56] he did that
[49:57] he sent lovely
[50:01] letters
[50:03] first APLE
[50:05] Paul started the forming of the
[50:11] another praise the Lord so the started
[50:14] long
[50:15] time amen now here he
[50:19] comes to us on our side he comes and
[50:25] he's giving us love
[50:30] praise the Lord some people say the
[50:33] seven
[50:35] Church praise the
[50:38] Lord is that right God God is
[50:44] moving is that right until we are
[50:48] gone
[50:50] because walked with God he was not let
[50:56] us not in seven
[50:58] church is
[51:00] moving the
[51:02] head praise the Lord The Head and the
[51:06] body they have
[51:09] toite and the two they are of
[51:13] one
[51:15] otherwise wouldn't have called Eve Flesh
[51:18] of My
[51:22] Flesh if she was picked from an elephant
[51:28] praise the Lord but Flesh of My
[51:31] Flesh why God made him
[51:35] life and removed from
[51:38] his even us to be the bride of
[51:42] Christ to make sure that we are out of
[51:48] his without
[51:50] such he can't manifest to anybody like
[51:55] that and when is doing the
[51:58] Manifest you who is not
[52:01] part it will be different you think life
[52:04] is
[52:09] going on the other hand when God is
[52:12] giving a
[52:13] bride to a man sometimes if that man is
[52:18] so
[52:20] pray he always me Theif of that
[52:25] man praise the Lord but if it's not
[52:28] prayed up I don't have words
[52:32] there Lord but a man who
[52:36] prayed God will give you your
[52:40] kind so to us to be of Christ we have to
[52:45] be from his
[52:48] Source from his
[52:50] side the
[52:52] bright praise the Lord the prophet says
[52:56] God promised in the last days that he
[53:00] would manifest and would vindicate his
[53:03] word to
[53:07] her that is I mean that's the bride
[53:11] praise the Lord God promised he's going
[53:14] to reveal manifest and
[53:20] V his
[53:22] word to
[53:24] her and still
[53:27] she wouldn't do it the bride
[53:31] now praise the
[53:33] Lord all that God promised her by his
[53:37] servants the
[53:39] prophets praise the Lord but the truth
[53:42] is promised to
[53:44] vindicate and he will make it sure you
[53:47] see
[53:49] it realize he put all possible
[53:54] ways to see it
[53:59] The Virgins are
[54:04] there but the pure
[54:06] bride must walk with the manifested word
[54:09] of
[54:11] God that manifested word of
[54:15] God
[54:17] isone but
[54:20] himself so when you were walking
[54:24] alone remember the first
[54:28] praise the Lord but when you're working
[54:30] with the manifested word which is Christ
[54:38] himself he went
[54:40] to and went away from the world because
[54:44] he was walking with
[54:46] him praise the Lord but when we walk
[54:50] alone what the devil join the
[54:54] charot the devil joins the
[54:58] he will make me a
[55:00] foolish who has the word the manifesting
[55:06] of but now the prophet says God promised
[55:12] toate in the last days his
[55:16] word praise the Lord now the prophet
[55:20] still says but the God is but God is
[55:24] great mystery
[55:27] what the Eternal God had as a
[55:32] mystery has now been unfolded in
[55:37] Jesus praise the Lord then given right
[55:41] down to his
[55:44] church what once in God's
[55:49] mind is now in the body of the of Christ
[55:53] Jesus
[55:56] and what is he doing prop says he is
[56:01] making his
[56:03] love to the
[56:06] church praise the Lord his
[56:09] bright
[56:11] Whispering secret to
[56:15] her praise the Lord this is what the
[56:17] prophet is
[56:19] saying nowy he is revealing and I mean
[56:24] he's making his love to the
[56:28] church that's why he said a manes
[56:33] me keep my words when he has kept my
[56:37] words just make love with
[56:40] him praise the Lord walk with him walk
[56:44] with I mean Christ is walking with
[56:47] him the church the bride after he's
[56:51] walking he's not telling louder secrets
[56:58] but he is
[57:00] Whispering the neighbor
[57:03] not
[57:05] right sometimes sorry for the young ones
[57:10] sometimes the married
[57:13] people I'm talking to the ones who are
[57:15] in
[57:18] love who don't have shadows in their
[57:21] Liv that
[57:23] marriage Paul said our marriage
[57:27] they reflect Christ and the
[57:30] church
[57:33] sometimes I don't know people in my
[57:35] house always been hearing I don't know
[57:38] whether people in my house have been
[57:42] hearing sometimes IIs to
[57:46] my even the neighbors
[57:49] know and we have them
[57:53] many so even Christ he's making love
[57:57] with the
[57:59] church and the church has accepted him
[58:02] as his
[58:04] bridegroom talking with him then he
[58:07] whisp secrets to
[58:09] her and one of the
[58:12] secrets one
[58:14] day go home one
[58:18] day day shall be away from this
[58:22] evil just like as
[58:24] men go
[58:27] men they don't wish bad to their
[58:30] wives then what about
[58:33] Christ what about
[58:36] Christ
[58:38] sometimes Sur this is this is so
[58:42] abnormal that the bride of
[58:46] Christ is so comfortable on the
[58:50] earth until some people say there's
[58:52] heaven on Earth
[58:57] that heaven on Earth that means they
[58:59] have made their homes so
[59:02] nice it is like heaven
[59:06] almost but they don't know Heaven
[59:09] because heaven is much than I can't
[59:13] explain what
[59:15] ising praise the Lord if
[59:19] men wish good to their loved
[59:23] ones Christ to his bride
[59:27] praise the Lord because he will take us
[59:30] to a
[59:35] wedding I want to you
[59:39] mares even though somebody doesn't have
[59:42] money make
[59:49] ising he wants the bright to eat
[59:53] well but what about Christ
[59:56] prise the Lord to his
[1:00:00] bride some of us we have never G to
[1:00:06] space but our
[1:00:11] hon the where it will
[1:00:15] be I can't tell but I think it's very
[1:00:19] nice how I wish to be
[1:00:22] there prise the Lord so Christ is making
[1:00:25] his love
[1:00:27] us and we accept
[1:00:30] that he's going to
[1:00:34] whisper so Judas who is
[1:00:36] here how will he manifest
[1:00:40] himself to me or to you not to the
[1:00:44] world one way if you love him and you
[1:00:49] keep his
[1:00:51] Commandments then he has to come and
[1:00:54] make love to to you
[1:00:57] and he has made that love to
[1:00:59] you there must be whispering of
[1:01:05] secet Praise the Lord and some of these
[1:01:09] secrets his
[1:01:12] coming the Lord and we have to
[1:01:17] know we going to be
[1:01:20] ignorant praise the Lord because
[1:01:23] everything is
[1:01:24] open the are
[1:01:27] finished but let's search them
[1:01:32] honestly and asking God his
[1:01:35] favor show us
[1:01:38] his but the Bible says you have to first
[1:01:42] love
[1:01:44] him because for him he led
[1:01:47] you then you have to love him back and
[1:01:50] then while you love him there must be
[1:01:53] aing
[1:01:56] abing no AB is AB with you there must be
[1:02:01] fellowship or something
[1:02:04] like and then while you in love with
[1:02:08] him he's giving you lovely
[1:02:11] letters take them sometimes we think God
[1:02:15] doesn't
[1:02:18] see because he can't act immediately so
[1:02:22] we think he's not seeing or something
[1:02:24] like that
[1:02:28] but many people of the
[1:02:30] earth if somebody gives you his
[1:02:33] treasure and you take it
[1:02:36] right that man will be
[1:02:39] offended praise the Lord so if God gives
[1:02:42] us his
[1:02:44] best take it
[1:02:48] negligently like praise the Lord what do
[1:02:52] you expect of
[1:02:53] him prise the Lord to other
[1:02:57] people could open
[1:03:02] and others the she could come and
[1:03:08] eaten and
[1:03:11] others so many things were done to them
[1:03:14] like the like the David and
[1:03:21] gise the Lord was taken off because he
[1:03:26] was defying the army of
[1:03:28] God so God is being gracious to
[1:03:32] us he has given
[1:03:34] us his
[1:03:37] word which we must walk
[1:03:40] with we must
[1:03:42] keep which we must okay which has to
[1:03:46] give us
[1:03:48] Direction Where to go praise the Lord so
[1:03:52] the prophet says
[1:03:54] now the Christ in the
[1:03:57] church is being made
[1:04:02] known prise the the Christ in the church
[1:04:06] is being
[1:04:09] known the whole thing
[1:04:12] is the ration of
[1:04:15] God the whole thing is of the revelation
[1:04:18] of
[1:04:20] God is to take Eve back to her right
[1:04:23] position
[1:04:27] praise the Lord the whole
[1:04:31] thing God wants to take us
[1:04:34] back our
[1:04:37] orinal
[1:04:39] positions where we had
[1:04:42] Dominion
[1:04:44] everything praise the
[1:04:47] Lord praise the Lord so he
[1:04:51] says again with her
[1:04:54] husband to take back to take Eve back to
[1:04:59] her right position
[1:05:02] again her
[1:05:04] husband praise the Lord
[1:05:07] notice and God is the husband of the
[1:05:13] church and the church is the bride of
[1:05:20] Christ praise the Lord so the prophet
[1:05:23] says
[1:05:26] calm down
[1:05:27] go Christ is in the
[1:05:32] church praise the Lord this what the
[1:05:34] prophet is saying Christ is in the
[1:05:38] church but I want to assure you some
[1:05:41] people don't know
[1:05:44] him they don't know him he is in the
[1:05:48] church in other
[1:05:50] words the word
[1:05:53] is is present
[1:05:56] not past nor future but he is in the
[1:06:03] church let me add one
[1:06:05] word right
[1:06:08] now he is in the
[1:06:11] church just being
[1:06:15] made praise the Lord and then the
[1:06:17] prophet
[1:06:18] says the whole thing is the reation of
[1:06:23] God take Eve back to her
[1:06:27] now what is
[1:06:29] it who is this
[1:06:32] Christ the prophet says in the message
[1:06:35] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:06:40] right says what is
[1:06:43] it the V
[1:06:46] what is
[1:06:49] Jesus
[1:06:51] today to
[1:06:56] he's making himself known they
[1:06:59] manifesting
[1:07:00] him that manifested
[1:07:04] Jesus
[1:07:05] word is Jesus
[1:07:09] to how many people are looking for
[1:07:13] Jesus the prophet says the man the vated
[1:07:19] word is Jesus to
[1:07:26] praise the Lord
[1:07:28] so how will you manifest yourself to us
[1:07:31] and not to the
[1:07:35] world here is the first
[1:07:39] view is the world
[1:07:43] concerned no are we
[1:07:46] concerned if yes he's making
[1:07:51] man Lord keeping his
[1:07:54] word will entitle
[1:07:57] us to more
[1:08:01] secrets because when we have
[1:08:05] him
[1:08:08] what then take the whole
[1:08:11] world but give
[1:08:13] me Jesus praise the
[1:08:17] Lord but some of us we love the world so
[1:08:23] much and yet in
[1:08:27] there
[1:08:28] nothing praise the Lord people tell me
[1:08:31] what about
[1:08:33] water that is for my help to sustain
[1:08:36] this
[1:08:37] body other if I would not take it then
[1:08:41] God would not put it there if I was not
[1:08:44] to take it then God would not bring
[1:08:47] it praise the Lord so it is there for me
[1:08:51] me through the Journey so I can't hold
[1:08:55] on it
[1:08:58] after
[1:09:02] ofure still
[1:09:05] die others
[1:09:08] think in this world there is
[1:09:12] O I know
[1:09:14] it Lord but take the whole
[1:09:18] world give me the Fountain of
[1:09:21] Life praise the Lord because sometimes
[1:09:25] I don't know people
[1:09:29] oy
[1:09:32] peopley people
[1:09:39] oygen but the doctors treating them the
[1:09:43] doctors who are working on
[1:09:47] them but
[1:09:51] which so may God help us
[1:09:55] that we may
[1:09:57] walk with the manifested word of
[1:10:01] Christ which the prophet
[1:10:05] said
[1:10:07] word
[1:10:10] the is
[1:10:12] Jesus today praise the Lord in other
[1:10:17] words the first
[1:10:22] if today if you walk without the
[1:10:27] manifested
[1:10:30] word allow me to
