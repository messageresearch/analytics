again another opportunity to be in his presence are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen and I want to appreciate the pastor once again for allowing me to come and speak to you I pray that you keep me in prayer as I speak the mind of God tonight let's turn to the Bibles in the book of Exodus chapter 12 Amen in Exodus where we read last week let's just Pi it from there verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the month of the to you speak unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take on they shall take to them every man and lamb according to the House of their fathers a lamb for for an house may the Lord bless his word we may be seated amen so where we picked up last week we saw the Exodus we saw the children of Israel how God had planed to bring them out of Egypt praise the Lord and now it had come to a time after God had visited Moses and had told him in the burning bush come down to deliver his people from bondage praise the Lord and God gave instructions to Moses on how Moses was going to do it so Moses went and started doing according to how the Lord had instructed so when Moses reached up Pharaoh it was not it was not an easy way for him so Pharaoh refused and said no the people shall not go and we know the many things that God did in Egypt in order to soften the heart of pharaoh praise the living now everything that Moses was doing pharaoh and magans were impersonating and doing the same thing praise the Living God came now to at this point this was different and they could not impersonate it and the Bible says speak all speak unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the 10 day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house so Moses went and told the people and remember these people were living in Egypt and now their supervisors their T Masters were Egyptians so they had every instruction that God had given to Moses and how Moses was giving it to the people take the message to pharaoh that's how Pharaoh was able to impersonate every miracle that God was doing in their midst and now when it came to this time the word of the Lord came saying tell the congregation of Israel that in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man lamb according the house of their fathers and in verse seven and they shall take of the blood so they were instructed to go sacrifies this lamb Slaughter it and then apply the blood the Bible says and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side [Music] posts and the upper door post and of the houses wherein they shall eat it and verse 11 and thus shall ye eat it with your Lo guarded your shoes on your feet your stuff in your hand and he shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover I will pass through the land of Egypt this night so now God spoke the word God spoke to Moses said Moses go and speak this is a spoken word praise the Lord so it was the word that God had given to Moses so it was God's word was God his instruction and now when the Egyptians heard it praise the Lord they did not have the mind of God to believe it the first things that happened talk about the Flies praise the Lord whatever Moses was doing they could do it talk about the snakes they could also do it praise the Lord because they saw Moses do it so they could now do it but now this time this was a spoken words this was the this was a matter of the heart for them to believe so when they heard it there was no way they could believe it there was no they could receive it because it was not ordained for them to even when they heard the word praise the Lord and they had Moses speaking to the children is they had nothing do about it praise the Lord why it was not given unto them prise the Lord there's something special here this spoken word the devil could not impersonate spoken word Pharaoh could not impersonate because he had no power to do it praise the Lord and now he could not believe it and the TK Masters and the enti Egypt so now when Moses spoke to them he said now this is the Lord's Passover and the Lord says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night praise the Lord remember it was before time praise the Lord it was at the beginning of the month when the word of the Lord came unto them came unto Moses and it was a space of 10 days praise the Lord he says in the 10th day of this month enough time praise the Lord and now the Bible says I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt man and Beast against all the gods of Egypt judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall beat you for a token upon the houses where you were praise the Lord so now when they heard the word they did according to the spoken word they received the word of God through Moses and when they received they believed it and whoever believed it and obey the instructions when the death angel passed the Bible says when I see the blood I will pass over you that was the tokenise the Lord but now this token came from the spoken words praise the Lord it came from the Vindicated words that Moses spoke to them which words could not be received by the rest of them except those that God had Ed praise the Living God so now we notice that at at uh in this Exodus after all the things that God had done this was the climax praise the lord of the process when God was bringing them out of Egypt to start set off their Journey to the promised land praise the Lord And now when they obey the instructions and had done according to how God had instructed they were spared but as they were spared it was whales praise the Lord it was it was sadness it was sorrow in the rest of the people that did not receive the words did not obey the words not apply the words praise the Living God so now we see that The Magicians praise the Lord would have heard this word they would have heard everything have the instructions but there is a hidden thing here God did not give them the Revelation to understand the power of the token were to apply the Lord so now in like the way they did it before were waiting to see what Moses was going to and yet this time it was not Moses praise the Lord it was the people because the instruction was go and tell the people so now it was the experience of the people with the words every individual every household they had to come into experience with spoken word app the token so now as they were waiting to see they saw was death in their caise the Lord so they could not impersonate it it was hidden for them to know receive the Revelation for them to believe it the entire Egypt would have applied the token praise the Lord so now we see that this token we see that this spoken word is but for the elect this spoken word is but for the predated spoken word is not for all of them but it is to them that we are known before the foundation of Praise the Lord they can all hear the word but they cannot apply the word they can all hear the spoken word but they cannot come into the experience of the life of the spoken words they cannot apply the praise the Living God so now we are talking about Exodus being a shadow of the three pools Exodus from egpt to can shadow of the three pools and now on the three pools showed them to the prophets to bring the people to believe praise the Lord God showed everything to the prophet of our day the same way he did it for Moses praise the Lord for Moses God gave him every instruction God revealed to Moses everything that God was going to do he did it why because God had entrusted Moses praise the Lord with the authority with the responsibility to bring the people out of Darkness to bring the people out of misery out of suffering out of Egypt to take them to their Promised Land praise the Lord and now the same way God gave the same instructions the prophet of Malachi chapter 4 he gave the same responsibility praise the Lord the spoken words he gave him the instructions to drive us out of Egypt to drive us out of Darkness to bring us into the countenance of the spoken words us out of Darkness out of sin to the promised land which is eternity so the same message has been given to Moses to drive the people from Egypt [Applause] is in the like man the same message that God gave unto to take us from from sin to the Rapture and now there is power in the spoken words and now I want us I want to say this this evening the word that God gave to to Mali chap that God gave to Prophet Elijah of our day he received the instructions he received the mind of God bring them to the people and when he was speaking he spoke to all the people prise the Lord and now not every person that received the spoken word believed it why this word isn't for all of them they in a mixed multitude in Egypt and this talken one differ shate the elect the child of God from the rest of the world prise the lord Moses spoke the word he said go and do it was in the open the Lord spoken word son was separating the believer the unbeliever praise the Lord spoken word but a separation separating us separating the SE separating the believer the elect of God from the rest of the world praise the Lord and now like I said on the three pools God still show the prophets what each of them would do praise the Lord like last like last Sunday the pastor quoted about the three pools he said something about the three pools praise the Lord and now the prophet spoke about in that message the anointed one at the end time first is healing the second pool is prophesying and the third pool is the word praise the Lord remember in Egypt God did mirac praise the Lord and those Miracles were to help make the people believe an attraction to attract the mind of the people to tell them there is something special here Lord to make them to believe their God remember most of them were born in that Strange Land and they didn't know their God so now whatever God did before Moses attract the people praise the Lord now the healing Services Prophet had those healing services and the Miracles that God did of Healing The Sick of raising the dead it was people to attention praise the Lord when when he prayed for you and you got healed it did not mean praise the Lord that you have received salvation that healing attract you to believe the that has healed you there something more to that something more to heal the Lord so it was the first pool and the second pool prophecy thus says the Lord praise the Lord so we shall look at that in details as we Su up our service so now we see that God revealed to the prophet all these pools and now in his ministry God gave him signs the same signs that he had given to Moses praise the Lord he gave him signs and now the first sign was also to make the people believe when the angel visited he says when you get the people to believe when you get the people to believe nothing shall stand before you not even canc praise the Lord now healing was one of the things that God was doing to let the people believe to come to this world praise the Lord but now healing is it not enough to prove that you you have salvation even the devil can impersonate praise the Lord the same way he impersonated the work of God in Egypt still imp personate the same we see many of them doing the same praise the Lord and now the two signs that we have given the prophet as we are going to see and as we have been told there was something more to the S praise the Lord say now when you get people to believe nothing shall stand before you and now he gave him two signs first the sign of vibration where he could hand touch the people he held their hands feel a vibration and now there was something around his hand hand could swell and when he felt the vibration he began to pray and when the vibration ceased the person healed and the person was instantly healed the Lord so the person who witnessed the vibration the person who witnessed the healing would be compelled to believe that William maram was preaching praise the Lord and he went ahead to give him the second sign which was the sign of discernment going down to the heart of the people reveal their heart condition calling men to repentance praise the Lord but this weren the Capone of his ministry this Wen the csone of his ministry one the climax of his ministry his ministry a message to prepare the people for the rupture praise the Lord so many people came we remember even during Jesus's time when Jesus was started his ministry he healed many people he made so many miracles praise the Lord and he could speak people's minds stand the people and of them came live because of what Jesus but there was more to the Miracles that he had to bring Salvation to the soul so he had to bring the words to the soul praise the Lord these two signs were not the climax of his ministry the Lord it had been nothing more than that praise the Lord now what was he to do he was to get the word the mind of God now bring to the people praise the Lord and he said on now this third occasion on the third pool which is not about prophecy which is not about healing praise the Lord he says God spoke to him and says now there is a third pool coming but don't try to explain it praise the Lord he says don't explain it why because the people could not see it and because the people could not see it with their eyes they were not to believe by seeing they not believe by touching but it was now the revelation of the word it was the word that was to be spoken itated word that was to be spoken heart now the third one was the heart condition was God speaking the mind to the heart of the people it was no longer healing was not prophesying now it was a heart condition praise the Lord it was the th say the Lord you believe it or you reject it or you reject it when Moses spoke the word some believed it and some rejected to those that believed it it was life and those that rejected it was death praise the Lord so now this third one we can't see it by our eyes we can't feel it by our sens is a heart condition prise the Lord is the word of God speaking to your heart a personal experience with the word of God no longer the sensations it's not about the prophecies but it is the word speaking to our hearts the word bringing us into knowledge of his words bringing us into his word praise the Lord where you are able to establish a personal relationship with him praise the lord we saw during Jesus's time he preached the gospel he healed the so many it but now when he began to preach when he began to bring the words spoken words speak their heart so many could not stand and so many went back and now he turn the rest of the TR say shall you also go praise the Lord now it was not Sensations it was not healing anymore it was the word praise the Lord it was the Revelation praise the Lord no wonder when he spoke and said unless you eat my flesh then they turned and said this man is here wi how can we eat his flesh how can he teach us to eat flesh praise the Lord and then said unless you drink my blood this man is a witch you are not expecting that expecting him to speak about healing to heal the sick make Miracles propes but now there was a turning point praise the Lord and this turning point was to call us to attention this turning point was to call the heart condition was to make a person Revelation each individual praise the Lord when he spoke some believed it why they had come into countenance they had come into the experience of the word of God he say don't explain it speak it and don't explain it why because they cannot believe it explain yourself they won't be able to believe it speak it it is now no longer the part of the Prophet now it was the part of God himself taking over his words and bringing his word to the people make himself known before the people have a personal experience with the people tell them let them get the lamb Slaughter it and put it up and put blood upon the L then the rest of them were like how will blood upon the L them from the death angelise the Lord but the people had a revelation was beyond the blood upon the L knew that this is a token God has given to us for our Salvation praise the Living God they believed it and applied it they were saved it was a point of discernment it was a point to prove them right or prove them wrong was a point of confusion before the enemy it was a point of confusion why he can impersonate everything else but he cannot impersonate the word praise the Lord that is a secret that is left only to the bright so when the spoken word goise the Lord the Bible says he has hidden this from the wise reveal them praise the Lord so when they spoken one go has hidden it from the rest of the world and he has revealed it only to the elect praise the Living God the rest of them won't be able to impersonate they can try they can try but at that point they fall short of it why they can never impersonate the word of God says don't explain it wasment piercing through the heart and mind of the people it is the word Christ making manifest in the body to the bright it is the word and the Bible calls it the word sharper than a two aged sword Lord going the int going through the mind and the hearts of the people cutting auning and pruning and pruning it finds an in our hearts so now it is Christ making himself known to the bride is Christ himself to the Bri and now Satan can't pull over this Revelation Satan can Ste this Revelation to make it known to his people it has be Christ and Christ Alone to make the word known to the people why told the prophet don't explain it it is my work speak the word I'll take the word and I'll make it know my people I make it known to them that we are predestinated the foundation of the word Jesus spoke and said in MTH 11: 2 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the father Lord of Heaven Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and them and babes even so father for so it seemed good in your sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man know the son but the father neither knowe any man the father and heever the son shall reveal him a person Revelation son Christ himself making himself revealed to the people making himself revealed to the elect he says God has hidden all the and revealed them only to the praise the Lord so he said no other no any other person not even any Prophet could reveal this to the people but the son himself so now this is a revelation the third pool Revelation is for the elect of God to receive to believe and come to knowledge of the mind of God for their day praise the lord we don't expect to see miracles we don't expect to see signs and wonders praise the Lord why a revelation it is a personal revelation a stage where Christ himself makes himself known to the personid he said no man knoweth the father except the son and no one knoweth the son except the father has revealed he said it is only the son that makes himself revealed those he called babes praise the Living God in First Corinthians 2:7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world our Glory which none of the princess of this world knew had they know know it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written ey Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have any enter neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for things this message this spoken word is prepared for the Bri he says no ear has not heard and eye has not seen nether have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him God has revealed them unto us by his spirit God has revealed his mind God has revealed his words by his Spirit through the prophet of Malachi for the Bri know right to come into the knowledge of the word that we come into that person experience with the spirit that person experience with the word praise the Lord it has to be the spirit of God it has to be Christ for the spirit sear as all things they things of God in the seven the prophet says remember Satan will try to impersonate he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do he tried to do it we've noticed it through the Antichrist this one this one thing he cannot impersonate there will be no mimics to this because he don't know it there is no way for him to know it it's the third PO he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it why because it is the revelation of the word and the says it's only Christ reveals it to us a heart condition praise the Lord Christ revealing his mind our heart individually not as a group it is individual as a group the enti group that was with Jesus when he spoke to them and said unless you eat my flesh and my blood the entire congregation would have remained but the rest of them left praise the Lord And now when he turned he looked at the disciples it was only left for the disciples why God had purposed that make himself known each of them it was a personal decision remain or to go in other words it is a personal affair man and God himself revealing himself to the people praise the Lord now at this time that's where we receive the word personally and believe the word personally and make a personal decision move with god with the word that voice when Christ comes down to reveal himself to us individually a confirmation that we are his and therefore nothing can take that word away from praise the Lord because the B says nothing can now separate us from that love which he has bested unto us when he loved us he made himself known to us and we have an affair with him an individual affair with him come to that experience nothing can separate us from that love praise the Lord and Pa it not even not even sickness not even hunger completely nothing not things present not things to come nothing can separate you the man has come knew that person experience the word of God praise the Lord and says and just then he picked me up he took me up and set set me up on high to where a meeting was going on it is a vision and the prophet speaking and said look like a t to a cathedal of some sort and I looked and there was a little like little place over in the over in the S and I seen that light was was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it w away from me like that and went over to that tent and said I'll meet you there and said this will be the third Po and you won't tell it to nobody and in Sabo Canyon he said this is the third pool and there is three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday other unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it is unknown language I was standing right there I looked right straight at it and this is the third coming up and the Holy Spirit of God that is the reason all heaven was silent and he said he could not interpret it the Revelation personal engagement the revelation of the words that Christ has to take by himself and brings to the heart brings to the soul praise the Lord to have a personal experience with God himself so now back to the Exodus God put this responsibility upon Moses to take them people out of Egypt to can God put this parden upon Moses to take the people all from Egypt through the Wilderness to Canan and Moses was just like one of them just an elevated brother to carry the burden praise the Lord and now we notice that many times the burden became heavy for Moses to and sometimes he could he could cry when the people's needs became so much for him to handle bur pushed him in a corner and he became helpless many times praise the Lord but as a minister He Could Cry Praise the Lord for the burdens of the people and he could run to God said God what must I do what must I speak to the people praise the Lord and when the people could not understand Moses position because all they to have their needs attended to so they knew nothing of what Moses was going through each time they got a burden they throw it before the eyes of Moses each time they had a need to bring it to Moses and say it is your responsibility because he said God told youing us from Egypt and taking us to Canan now here is our need so now they used to attack him they could insult him they thought he wasn't human like them mes was a human that God simply used move them through the Exodus to the promised land praise the Lord and I want to Echo something here like I said last week that this Minister Moses is a human who is carrying our burdens praise the Lord this man Moses is a human that was carrying all their needs praise the Lord and Moses could not live his life praise the Lord he was living the life of the people because without him that people would not move his mind Serve the People all the time think of how they shall move through the world how they shall come out of Egypt they shall cross Red Sea praise the Lord and the people never Rec organized the position of Moses they never organized how bur for him to carry praise the Lord so now they reached the time praise the Lord they came to a point they were thirsty and when they were thirsty they came to Moses they were at Mar and the waters there were bit and not t of it they turn to Moses and says give us water give us water need we want to take water I want liken this the Ministers of today I want like Moses's service the ministry today praise the lord we go to God and often kneel down and pray and say God this is my desire bless me with this God this is my heart condition put me out of sin put me out of this of iniquity and now God pulls it over and takes it the minister praise the Lord because you can't understand it unless maybe you've been rebuked so now all our prayers all our cries all our AB throw them to God throw them to the minister and gives him the burden to go and lighten the burden of the people praise the Lord that's what Moses was going through they said we want water they could not turn anywhere and they turn to him and now Moses also turned to God God what shall I do the people are thirsting and they crying and they insulting then God revealed him God spoke to him Moses go and do this praise the Lord and then Moses came and and they were very happen but they didn't know the pressure that Moses was going came up and drink drank the water quench their thirst then they moved again they reached says in in the of sin again they became thirsty stand against Moses and again they rebuked him Moses cried God and they forgot that at some point they sin before God and when they sin it took Moses to stand in between and plead for God forgive their we remember when Moses had gone to mount received the Commandments when they were here impatient they pulled over and came to Aon and fored him that they could have a goat wash and then he allowed it and they made a golden remember when Moses came down God was very Furious was going Smite all of them but Moses God had instructed him these are my people put them from Egypt to Canan your responsibility so Moses had to stand in between he had to plead with God he interceded and he prayed must upon them he prayed night have and reminded them these are your people serve them this is my church conation G away upon them forgive them he was praying for them he was carrying their AB praise the Lord so that they could appear where before God was upon was put upon Moses it was put upon the minister to carry the burdens of the people and nowesh again became thirsty there was no water there was no River it was a rock the burden again came back to Moses and they went to him and said we want water and they were very angry and they were putting him to the and he was crying out to God and he cried out to God and when he cried to God in the book of [Applause] numbers from around verse3 praise the Lord God spoke to Moses and he gave him an instruction he says don't cry go and speak to the Rock praise the Lord the burdens of the people made him to to cry and now when God had his cry he was crying in his closet crying to God and are too much people are angry angry with me of what I do give me what I'll show to them and God told him this time is not the road this time it is the spoken word go speak to the Rock praise the Lord and when you speak the rock water will come out and people will fetch and people will drink praise the Lord now we see two things there we see the spoken words and the manifestation of the spoken words praise the Lord the word says the Lord speak to the Rock upon the Lord vindicate the word so that water could come out but because of the pressure of the people maybe when Moses came out they could not allow him to do what God had instructed him to so they pushing him pushing so he became angry praise the Lord because he was human then he got the road again and he struck The Rock T and water came out that's not what God had asked him but because of the pressure of the people he was compelled to do it the burden of the church the burden of the people upon the ministers they had forgotten he was human too and they were impatient wait upon the will of God sometimes when we have need we lay them before God even speak the pastor and he prays for us and they pray over us and they say go believeing God will grant it let's be patient praise the Lord sometimes we and we are pushing pushing to the pastor and the pastor somehow has not gotten time maybe to visit over or maybe to come and pray for you praise the lord we shouldn't become angry we should pray for them the people we prayed for Moses Moses would come in the same mind of God tell the people what God has said and maybe would speak the Rock and The Rock would bring water but he came and compelling him pulling him he struck the Rock and what happened God became angry with and God told him it's true the burden of these people upon your back and have given them over to you but this that you have done this is not a I told you I gave you the spoken words go and speak go and speak this time it was at Kadesh it was a different environment praise the Lord God wanted to manifest God wanted to vindicate his word said go and speak the words remember Moses had done this before he had spoken flies into there spoken so many things into existence in Egypt and this time because of the burden of the people and because his soul was overwhelmed he short of it and instead he struck the rock burdens of the people upon the minister we pray that God may give our ministers Grace to to his word take the spoken word delivered unto them to bring them to us because we know that the mind of God perfect for us praise the Lord so now Moses came short of that God said you will not drive them from here you will not enter can you will not enter Canan why he did not speak the word he did not speak the word and God wanted to manifest his word and this is what the prophet says about God wanted Moses to have faith that he had put in the Fai that he had put in in the gift that he had clearly God clearly proved Moses and the people that it was him by the word and by the things that was said come to pass it was clearly identified there was no need of him worrying anymore about it there no more of him thinking anything about was clearly cleared up he had already done things and he had already proved by flies and fleas and fleas and he spoke things into creation and the word of God was in him so he is going to ask now what to do when the circumstances Lays right before him and he says I hope this goes way down to us and we see where we are at don't it make you feel about that big don't Don't It Make You Feel big about it think about mesing his fault and look talk about his faults look at our he yeah here he was standing there KN that the scriptures said that was the hour and the day for for that to happen God had met him in a pill of fire and it went right down before the people and performed these things and everything he said it came to pass even to bring things into creation and here was the circumstance with the people that he was raising up bring the promised land and then was standing crying what must I do that's a human being as a as brother Roy Slaughter I believe he's standing outside the door told me one time about somebody doing something to me and say well I did this and now this is and now is that he said brother let them lean on your shoulder today tomorrow you pack them and tomorrow you pack them and that's just the way human beings is lean on your shoulder today tomorrow you P them that is it that's what Moses was was doing God had to pack him along after he ordained him and proved it to do it and the people to have said Moses say the word I seen you do it there God honed you there God honored you there praise the Lord he said the people would have said Moses speak the word we saw you doing there God honed you there and you are the same one today amen see do it amen he ought to have know it but he didn't all right just as it was did so it is now we find out that so he said God must just got enough of it God must have got fed up on it he says why are you crying to me about haven't I already Pro proved my identification haven't I told you that I sent you for for for the job to do this I promise that I will do this and I be I be with your mouth I would speak through you and I would do this and you show signs and wonders I promise do this have not I did just exactly destroyed every enemy from around you and here you are standing out now the Red Sea right the line of duty what I told you to do then stilling and crying to me don't you believe me but Moses was crying because of the burdens of the people God was proving to him that yes I chose you and I gave you my word I will be your mouthpie you speak the word and I will do it God was ready to vindicate the words that Moses was speak it was now God himself the role of Moses was speak the role of the prophet of Malachi was to speak what God has given him to speak praise the Lord it was not his duty whether the people at that time were to believe him or not praise the Lord he had done the Miracles done the prophesy and now this time was the time for him to speak the words upon God himself take a hold of his word make to believe his words the Lord the prophet says Moses I I told you I am your mouthpiece oh that is very sweet to hear God spoke and said I am your mouth so when we see the minister praise the Lord speaking the word to us that's not his words it's a mouthpiece speaking what God has ordained prise the Lord when the prophet came to preach when he spoke the words that was not speaking that was God speaking the El speak the words don't explain it speak it I'll take it because I said in the words it is upon me to reveal it the babes those that have been predestinated Moses speak why do you cry speak and I will do it and when you hear this the prophet said when he was in that Vision prise the Lord And now when when when God had showed him the first one the first pool now he saw the second one and the third one he told him don't explain it why it's not a man's work anymore it is now upon the Lord the Bible says says The Battle Belongs to Me praise the Lord now it is now a battle it is a matter of the heart it is a matter of the Soul it is now speaking salvation to the heart it's not about the Miracles Miracles are good praise the Lord but now at that point the speaking of the words there is no Miracle there is God himself to take the word praise the Lord and make himself known to the people speak it and don't explain it why it is now my duty the angel himself made angel the Lord Jesus Christ himself come upon the scene to take up the message of take it it from [Applause] will says now you're going to speak and when you speak don't explain it I will take it myself and I will make them no this Tru I make them believe this truth I make them know that this is the truth and I'll make Mind Of God known to them speak it don't add explanation praise the Lord and that's what we are also doing we get the word because the prophet says speak what he spoke so we get the words and we speak to the people praise the Lord out of our powers to make the people believe it but when we speak it because it's the word of God God takes a hold of it and he makes himself known to the people praise the Lord he make himself revealed to the people he said I heard it but I can't speak it because it was in un unknown language it was hidden God only that must make it known each one of us and we are such a blessed people praise the Lord that when we heard that word regardless of whether it was in Unown language when you heard it it is very hard very hard for you to take it but somehow you found Grace to receive it and believe that it is the truth it is out of your powers to believe that this is the truth that is a personal encounter with Christ himself making himself known to the people praise the living Bo so now at that point God ask Moses to speak he wanted himself to let the people see because all along told Moses get your road go and do this get your Ro go and do this and people were seeing that Moses was doing it seeing Miracles Miracles time God wanted it to be the spoken word speak the word and I'll make it manifest speak the word if Moses had spoken the word he would speak the word God could get the word God could get that word have gotten the what when Moses spoke to the Rock and God could make a manifestation of himself he could have made the manifestation the Lord cause the water to flow out believe would see that because God had spoken praise the Lord what a lesson what a lesson oh my at this stage of the journey where we are standing look where we are right now yes sir at the third one we are right here at the door of the coming of the Lord he was anointed for the job and still waiting for thus says the Lord God must just have got enough of it don't cry any more speak I sent you oh God what this church ought be this morning God perfect Vindication with the pillar of fire and the signs and wonders and everything just like it was in the days of Sodom he said it would return right back praise the Lord just like he spoke to Moses and says go and speak the words go and tell the people this is what they going to do let them simply apply the blood and the rest of it shall be upon me the same voice of God because we know that he's the same yesterday and forever the same voice that spoke to Moses the same voice that has spoken to us praise the Lord the same voice that has called us to attention that has called us to the light that has called us to believe the Spoken Word of Our Praise the Lord and God is so gracious praise the Lord that he got a hold of this spoken word and he made it known to us that we can know the mind of God for our day and he has hidden it from the rest of the world and made it only known to us the babes elected the predestinated blessed be blessed be the god father of our Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all Heavenly blessings in Christ Jesus praise the lord we who he for you has he predestinated Us Praise the Lord has he prepared us has he adopted us two children that we can hear the spoken words believe the spoken words apply the spoken word praise the Lord it is a blessing to the elect praise the Lord so now the first pool is healing praise the Lord just like the prophet said it does not mean that there is no more healing no praise the lord we can still FAL and ask God to heal Us Praise the Lord but like I said in my text that The Exodus is a shadow of the three pools when God visited Moses in the buring bush he told him I have a covenanted people got a covenant which I made with Abraham with andac over years ago and now it is time that I'm coming to honor my Covenant prise the Lord so regardless of the condition of the people they had been Justified because God had made a promise Abraham and now he comes down and tells Moses bring them out when he brought them out all through the Wilderness they went through sanctification the people went through so many troubles they went so many chastisements each time they rejected subjected and he justed he brought them back to the W praise the Lord And now when they reach Kadesh tells them pick out a few of them I want them to go and enter into can I want them to go and see what the land looks like praise the Lord and when they went there they could come back to Give A tes and the same thing when God had given the word you know it could have been mes who could have entered into the into into can to go see what is there but because of what had happened told him you're not going to cross over so thankful to God that he allowed our Prophet praise the Lord when he brought us out when he gave us the message to bring us out of of the world and now when we went through the the sanctification process which we go through every day God allowed the prophets to go be the C of go and see what is there praise the Lord he pulled him over and he open the curtain and he took him in so he could be able to see what is there get a testimony and then he got there he saw those brothers and sisters died way when they old when he saw them they were young in the youthful stage and each of them was happy and he saw Serene environment and he was very happy allowed him to go and see so he brings back A tes for us as a witness praise the Lord and now God allowed a few of them including Josh [Applause] andoss to goise they could go and get a w a witness so they could come over and bring a testimony we are so thankful to God that whatever thing that God wants us to know has put down the scriptures we are so thankful to God also revealed his word to Us Praise the Lord so we know who we are we are the elect of God we know who we are the Bride of God we are the people that have satisfied the requirements we have believed the word we have received the spoken word and we have believed it and he calls us the elect he calls us the predestinated he calls us the adopted children the Lord they have been set aside waiting upon him for the rupture praise the Lord Moses pulled them over and when he reached there did not enter in Praise the Lord as in for us when he pull us over the same Minister same messenger that he used to deliver unto us the spoken words he allowed him to still cross over and go and test praise the Lord of that eternal life tested he came and told us so we know everything from Egypt to Canan we know everything from the time when we are still where we are going God has revealed all these things has given us the grace to believe the message he has given us the grace to believe the spoken word apply the token praise the Lord so he gives us his life he justified us he Sanctified us and give gave us a part of life praise the Lord which is the Life of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord and it's that life the holy spirit that is going to drive us over to cross over to the other side we are people that have received the word there are people that have received the light of the day we are people that are wit have witnessed all the pools and God has given us the grace to stand the test of time to witness his words know that he is God he is faithful that he started a good work with us and he's going to pull us over to the other side praise the Living God we had so much speak about the three pools but we believe that it was the mind of spoken to us this and we appreciate God that he has given us this life the life that we live is no longer ours but Christ is and the same life that we live the life of Christ is what is going to drive us to the rapture we shall not die but we shall live praise the lord we shall not die we shall live to seek Christ God bless we can get on our Fe amen let's get on our feet I say pray as the brother toship preciously
