read through the words teach through it heavenly father right now bless every soul remember that was glorified thou has removed it far unto all the ends of the earth lord in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them that god may lift us back to the top of the mountains again he says in verse 17. like as a woman with the child [Music] so have we been in thy sight oh lord where did you wait around with one game may the lord have blessed in the reading of his word you may be seated [Music] [Music] those pains always cause us to pray to observer it causes us to draw closer to the law he said he's in trouble they have visited you covered they poured out a prayer when chastening was upon them amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shall because her hour is coming is our year to sing so that way bath comes through pain within me but as soon as she's delivered of the child um [Music] [Applause] and and your heart shall rejoice i am where jesus

boxing of the holy ghost look what is that no man takes away the purpose of pay but yet again it will always bring you closer to the lord and then bring you to a higher level than you have ever been doing amen so now listen friends we are created of god so after creation [Music] [Applause] manifestation [Music] you can't beat your translation fostered me to this day he didn't post me in the days of noah the chanter moon after a new world did not post me in the days of luther movies fostered me to this season [Applause] but then when our manifestation comes with a window that eternal seed estimates is placed in the body of flesh amen now the clean eternal seed will temper kindness together you already know from the blessed in the natural body that everyone will be your government that's controlled by genetic weaknesses you understand the gene now would you together instagram it controls nature that's why a white man will always have a white child and a black man norms [Applause] maybe you've got hands like a chimpanzee these natural bodies maybe different families have got different genes that run through them again amen amen and then you find that all these people here what about they are always cruel but come every so now because once you shout at me for no reason there is a chain on the inside that is which always awakens to a little bit of emotion may [Applause] i've got such an emotion in me that when something goes wrong around me interesting maybe before he can say anything about it [Applause] i start flowing my eyes begin to flow with tears in turn they cannot create so now i want to tell you that that clean eternal genes is placed in a body which has got all kinds of form of weaknesses all forms of failures amen i mean but you know at the same time [Music] [Applause] you have ain't look so two things now would you become let me believe if you are a seed according to god the seed chain of god then you know god has placed a representation that isn't there is something that desires to do the will of god are you together with me [Applause] do you love him you know there was always something in there come unto me he died ending come unto me but then there was a human spirit no more [Applause] you've been raised up into the gate [Applause] you have got a joy in causing trouble holiness because the human spirit has developed that way [Applause] that always feels like you want to be like anybody else within an election election [Applause] [Applause] something that causes him to come to god i can't wait to get on that [Applause] [Applause] he doesn't care doing what he does suffer he doesn't care staying on drugs he doesn't [Applause] when you don't feel that there is something pulling you close at god that you just find a joy in doing evil he wants to be then there is a problem the lord which stretches forth the heavens guru and layers foundation of the earth era missing agency and forms the spirit but this is the spirit by which you live [Applause] amen i mean the body i mean the spirit which you need your weight out there to activate your body okay so every man whatever you want to receive this kind of spirit to be alive [Music] [Applause] you love him this morning we know that the lord is spiritual verse 14. but i am canon under sin [Applause] he can easily listen to the human spirit manguin i saw who is someone you're welcome to and they do things that are not right you are correctly be truthful are you together with me for that which i do i allow note for what i would that do i know but what i hate that idea how many people have some contradiction in their lives knowing that this is not right why don't you not take it to food but you find by the weakness of your body i was willing to love nothing you are doing what is not right to be done that's why he proceeds to which i hate attention because this flesh here has got a human spirit will not among your world that is so closer contracted to the evils amen amen [Music] if then i do that which i would not yo bangla [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] may not are you together with me there's nothing in there there's no voice coming to me there's no question [Applause] are you together with me how many of you make women [Music] regardless of how far you take him is [Applause] [Applause] m so paul says i always stand in this kind of situation how will i come unto him so if you lose the conscience knowledge so when [Applause] there will always be something that will take away your peace you will always be condemned you will always cry to be restored with word [Music] [Applause] he says the only way you can overcome your flesh is if you walk in the spirit single time the spirit takes over the control your africa of your decision instead i warn you that whatsoever you want to do i will tell you you will see it through the eye of the world god is walking in the spirit i'm going to stop meeting yourself where are you the leadership of the been so world paul said for the flesh lastest against the spirit these flesh always fight against the holy ghost with that quran even if you are filled with the holy ghost it came to the soul why did you amend me but the flesh [Music] you keep looking at the watch the flesh wants to do something else [Applause] i've got an appointment i'm supposed to make some money i didn't know you're going to be i'm supposed to meet soon i'm going to have a job appointment need your comments the weekend is not for church weekend it is at least weekend i should do certain things if you do not work in the spirit what a tumbling ammo of the spirit [Music] amen amen for the fleshless against [Applause] you will always have a contradiction when you receive the best of the hope there will always be a war in you until you fully submit yourself to the lord [Applause] to be myself like he was going to say government william branham well 40 years ago the william branham william it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there i would say william branham he was a rascal because i was born of [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] as a baby first thing you know i become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because i raised that that way [Applause] he says but if you are elect are you going to work for him there was always a speck of life in there and when the mother eagle swung around where i will be that way come [Music] [Applause] to make a decision to leave your friends to love your alcohol in your habits you're going to go through pain why not come to the new bathroom [Applause] [Applause] foreign he says i see another law in my [Music] [Applause] oh you deserve to overcome or end up angular you want to stay in the perfect will of god you want to stand right then it says walk in the spirit that may not you are not going to stay in when the church is open tell this body i'm locking my shop he looks very educated i'm going to church [Music] don't allow this body to know amen amen to rule against you [Applause] listen that's so christ for total deliverance it cries for total deliverance and then god starts your next journey which takes you into your arrest and he makes sure that you get there he told you through the wilderness of trials and that's the purpose of our pain that i'm going to explain when israel were slaves in israel i mean in egypt [Applause] [Applause] because do you love him this morning [Music] that you are born of god that you are elected and god has given you that life giving you that understanding together born again [Music] [Applause] and we know that we are of god but the word lies in wickedness so there is a dividing line that's what i believe and you should not allow the comes with a self-identification we don't know [Applause] and the moment you say we are of god they don't come into the background then you begin to question what handicapped what am i going to do there already i'm of god you are catholic the world lies in sin yes why should i go do this right now move this coming i am of god then you are exponential you are telling your body only that i am of god in zendo and there are two there have been that want to control this body have you enough confident the fallen nature articulation children and the dream of god let's go ahead so now when you get baptized of the holy ghost [Applause] then the [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] amen so that you can be seen develop yourself whenever that word of god god chooses certain men to bring to us [Music] to show how the overcomer lives his life [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and see what god wants you to be what would that generate men that were worse controlled by your fallen nature but they rose and you know kind of a bridge background where you overcome the flesh that's what it is negativity because that eternal seed one gets scared they'll never be destroyed how can god take that eternal nature into hell yeah it can't happen so this means that anybody was an eternal seed in here faith some people get so proud because their lives are fine not trial against no problem no trouble [Applause] that i've already spoken about enoch abram sarah isaac jacob jacob joseph moses muslim amen amina and then great people like rihanna joshua amen i mean and then barrack david samuel many many many years ago he's calling them a great cloud of witnesses [Applause] of hebrews 11. [Applause] [Applause] he placed the blessing you're telling his son ahead of her wilderness you might say they don't go they have to go through the wilderness and when they were going back he said i'm going to send my angel before i come and never see the camera [Applause] [Applause] i'm going to send my angel before them [Applause] [Applause] don't tell them away hebrews 12 5. and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as children leaders in [Music] [Applause] for whom the lord laughs he chastises do you see the purpose of your trial they say well i'll just go just every son whom he received [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Applause] [Applause] such moments they come our way very dark simply because we are children of the father we go through the training as children just naturally [Applause] shall we not much more rather being subjection and the father of spirits [Applause] spirits so that it can get under the control of the holy ghost amen i mean at this moment say that you know you get into your bath paints you get into your sorrows you begin to realize manner the friends you have now though are not the best you know i'm a singer the fashions you have hey they are not the best for you they do not reflect the life from the inside of your [Music] and then you go through a pain why are you comfortable with me because the people are going to see you when they are going to tell the difference [Applause] but that pain is leading you to burst praise god back under my spirit you'll begin to feel the challenge to manifest occult you see when you go home whether you come you read the proverbs 7. solomon was saying my son. because people say is what's reflected on the outside i love it um but after you are born again and your manifesto the bible says there comes a joy amen amen isaiah where we read 26 decided [Music] [Applause] [Music] when the chastising was upon them so the prophet isaiah happy on the messiah is realizing what brings a man closer to god are you commanding through excellence when a man goes through moments of pain i'm not trying to be safe even the most wicked nothing will always try to call upon god but he may have so for you to have the cry that brings the new birth is you to cry now you are crying father transform my life jesus [Applause] so have we been in the recital amen i mean he says that we are according to it he says very very excellent to you that you shall weep and laments but the world shall rejoice amen i mean at that time when you cry book said that the word but yet a little while i'll [Applause] [Music] what has happened to you obviously is crucial you are becoming a miserable puritan prophet amen but after that there comes a joy there is a deep cry what could you do that comes our way okay when we begin to fast fast amen before the manifestation of the new birth [Music] we live in the bodies that can easily be touched by sin wow listen really when christ came into this natural body whispered he had also come under subjection to the control yeah of all the elements of this flesh but he overcame angular because the dove came down in order to lead the land with a total submission hallelujah but then i agree god also took him twice the same pain process [Applause] when the holy ghost came down and manifest your life israel israel obtain the promise could they go there without going through the wilderness is travailing erica cinder to be born again you hear of earthquakes just while carving and they will do that there is a lot of things that are happening every day your heart can go through very long you know droughts yes i said if it continues like this for another year why you came and the monk is also a cambodian for lack of fruit they were bringing themselves closer to human habitation delicate they said this is about really it was terrible [Music] my thought now to you and there was anger with you it takes pain distress discomfort look now them pharisees die to the lord [Music] way take her and it was misinterpreted for them and they held that as eternal life to them to have eternal life you have to go through pain why not drop that look at what you've been given trinity obstacle sprinkling baptism all kinds of things and you are struggling with them but you have to go through a pace of the truth listen now brother branham says an old commander now we find that rain according to which brings fruit upon the earth it is born as the poet said [Music] [Applause] because you know the vapor goes up and then the cycle continues it takes that lightning [Music] to bring forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth back it takes time to me and as the clouds die too far rain is born americans are required because rain is part of that cloud today that has to see so the other one can exist [Applause] [Applause] [Music] out of you hallelujah god knows that on the idea that out of place he wants to be with the joy i end up told [Applause] pain wouldn't mean that you may be born again it was taking them into brushing yeah some person get done into cleaning up [Music] you don't want to know god says i know how to handle that i will take you to babylon for about 17 years and in the seven tears you will be able to pray you will be able to thank god you will be able to submit to his will absolutely and then he says yeah the seventy years are over come back and have a revival do you see the purpose of pain god doesn't frustrate his children he doesn't just allow things to happen so that you may feel the pain depending on yourself no the world is not a sadness he allows pain for a purpose in our life [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all kinds of pains sometimes it's losing your job sometimes [Applause] [Music] is it strange that god wants us to devote a christ like a character can imagine trial guess everyone praise god cartoon diversity let's go to jeremiah i'm finishing my reason yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the purpose of peace jeremiah 18 2. i rise and go down to the porter's house and they'll cause you to hear my words and then [Music] stepping out of life what is the solution so immediately again another vessel i seem to go to the portal to make it erratic [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down no command and to destroy him leave that nation against you may have pronounced it from [Applause] i mean the eyes of the the bitter if your mind can be seen in this god all this pain we go through what would mean god wants to get the best out of us he knows how to make us call upon him he has full authority over the killing i know when he is [Applause] this one is stubborn you know let me break it again isn't it wonderful yeah you are telling me hearing the prophet says here now set forth the love of god why not be acquainted with [Music] [Music] [Music] to conform into his image in their work he reproves them without long suffering and the prophet saws [Applause] he has got this size of pores where i get it he has this one for the table he has this one for the corner you cannot tell him what you want to be hallelujah every type of pot whatever has got its own desire it goes through its own pain it goes through some christ differently will call upon god differently our challenges are my trials will not be your choice [Music] amen [Music] there is no true believer [Music] so that they can produce unexpected amen so now we're finishing here might is that right now i want [Music] [Music] because they are my children they take them into childhood training something about hallelujah they go through pain to learn how to submit okay he wants to building us the character god bless you
