[32:04] As we wait on the minister, let's sing
[32:06] that song.
[32:10] Are you washed in the blood?
[32:17] Are you washed
[32:20] [singing]

[33:07] they were. As low are you

[33:16] Yes. Are you wash? Are you wash

[33:25] Precious blood [singing] in the soul.
[33:32] [music]
[33:34] Heat. Heat.
[33:43] [music]
[33:45] We have
[33:51] [music]
[33:52] you
[33:58] [music]
[34:03] [music]
[34:08] [music] might
[34:14] [music]
[34:14] Let
[34:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:23] &gt;&gt; us praise. [music]
[34:25] [applause]
[34:49] You will be there in their midst.
[34:52] And Lord, we believe you are here, Lord.
[34:55] And you also promised in your word,
[34:58] and they shall be taught of the Lord,
[35:00] and great shall be their peace.
[35:03] If they may come and take to us, Father,
[35:07] show us the path that we have to take,
[35:08] Lord.
[35:11] meet all the needs we have into your
[35:12] hands.
[35:14] Give your grace to come down in our
[35:16] lives
[35:18] for sister Alis
[35:22] together her family over the passing on
[35:24] of their brother.
[35:28] Lord you may give them comfort and
[35:30] strength.
[35:32] Comfort that whole family in the name of
[35:34] Jesus.
[35:36] We also pray for our sister Barbara.
[35:39] also
[35:40] give comfort together with the children
[35:42] over the passing on of their beloved
[35:45] one. Lord,
[35:48] we pray that your grace may abide in all
[35:50] this.
[35:53] Also bless us now
[35:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus who pray.
[35:59] Amen. Amen.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; We're reading in the book of Numbers
[36:07] chapter 16.
[36:14] Numbers chapter 16 and then we're
[36:16] reading from verse one.
[36:23] The Bible says
[36:26] &gt;&gt; now Kora the son of Isa the son of
[36:30] Kohath the son of Levi and Dathan and
[36:34] Abraham the sons of Elab and On the son
[36:38] of Palace sons of Robin took took men.
[37:07] And they rose up before Moses with
[37:09] certain of the children of Israel, 250
[37:13] princes of the assembly, famous in the
[37:16] congre Congregation, men of renown.
[37:41] and they gathered themselves together
[37:43] against Moses and against Aaron and said
[37:46] unto them, "You take too much upon you,
[37:50] seeing all the congregation are holy,
[37:53] every one of them, and the Lord is among
[37:56] them. Wherefore then lift ye up
[37:59] yourselves above the congregation of the
[38:02] Lord.
[38:23] May God bless of his word. You may be
[38:26] seated.
[38:29] We want to share on the opposing spirits
[38:31] in the Exodus.
[38:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Opposing
[38:39] spirits in the Exodus.
[38:43] Now you see that the Lord was taking the
[38:45] children of Israel
[38:49] from Egypt to the promised land.
[38:54] And the Lord had chosen Moses
[38:58] to be able to handle this this kind of
[39:02] Exodus.
[39:05] And Moses
[39:06] was proved among the children of Israel
[39:11] that he has been chosen of God
[39:14] with infallible signs and wonders.
[39:19] And then even whatever Moses was
[39:22] speaking
[39:24] was coming to pass.
[39:27] Praise the name of the Lord. Not once,
[39:30] not twice, but several times.
[39:34] The children of Israel were entirely
[39:37] depending upon Moses
[39:41] to lead them.
[39:43] Now, Moses would bring the voice of God
[39:49] in their midst.
[39:51] They had the pillar of fire.
[39:54] And then the pillar of fire
[39:56] would become a cloud during the time
[40:01] and you know it was leading them
[40:04] you know guiding them in the Exodus.
[40:08] And now when they kept on moving
[40:11] every challenge that they had
[40:14] crying to Moses and then Moses would cry
[40:17] to God
[40:19] respond and you know it kept on like
[40:22] that continuously
[40:25] and you know we are also in an exodus.
[40:30] Praise the name of our Lord. The third
[40:32] exodus.
[40:34] Praise the name of our Lord. In the
[40:37] message the third exodus,
[40:40] brother Brham says we are in an exodus
[40:45] and living
[40:50] and turning the tapes off in a moment.
[40:57] All my friends,
[40:59] my brothers,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; both present
[41:04] and that will hear the tapes
[41:08] as your brother
[41:11] and citizen of the kingdom of God.
[41:17] Come out
[41:19] in this Exodus.
[41:21] come out in this exodus.
[41:24] For all that is left behind
[41:28] will bear the mark of the beast.
[41:32] Come out of Babylon.
[41:35] Come out of this confusion.
[41:38] Come out of these systems
[41:41] and serve the living God.
[41:44] says we are in an exodus.
[41:47] A call to come from denominations
[41:50] from all these denominations
[41:53] you know says come out of those
[41:55] denominations
[41:59] religions
[42:02] has got two parts
[42:05] which is coming out and then entering
[42:08] in. So now when he takes us out,
[42:13] when he takes us out,
[42:15] &gt;&gt; then he puts us inside.
[42:18] He took them out of Egypt
[42:21] and then he placed them in the promised
[42:23] land.
[42:25] So even as he takes out of confusion of
[42:27] religion
[42:30] and then he and then he puts us into the
[42:33] body of Christ,
[42:35] baptized into the body of Jesus Christ.
[42:40] Praise the name of Then he says this
[42:43] great angel of the covenant.
[42:47] Jesus Christ in the form of God
[42:52] thought it not
[42:54] but became equal with God.
[42:59] Now he is the pillar of fire
[43:02] in the same form that he was back there
[43:06] bringing the first Exodus
[43:10] bringing the second exodus
[43:13] and is here with the third exodus
[43:18] you see that in the first Exodus
[43:21] pillar of fire they had a mighty prophet
[43:24] in their midst
[43:27] the mighty prophet
[43:30] He was guiding them. He was leading
[43:32] them. And then now we see here it says
[43:36] that the first Exodus
[43:39] what did he do? He brought them out of a
[43:43] natural land
[43:46] that is Egypt to a natural land
[43:51] that is Israel
[43:53] the promised land. Then the second
[43:56] exodus,
[43:58] he brought them out of a spiritual
[44:00] condition
[44:03] that was during the time of our Lord
[44:04] Jesus Christ
[44:06] when he was here on earth. So he took
[44:09] them from a spiritual condition.
[44:13] You know the laws of Moses,
[44:16] the Jewish traditions,
[44:19] you know what they had like you know
[44:21] following the Sadducees, the Pharisees
[44:26] 16
[44:28] where they were sacrificing animals
[44:32] where they had a form of worship.
[44:35] God was picking them out from that
[44:38] condition,
[44:40] from a spiritual condition
[44:43] into the spiritual baptism of the Holy
[44:46] Spirit.
[44:49] Now, you notice that in the first
[44:51] Exodus,
[44:53] they had a promise. They had where they
[44:56] were looking forward
[44:58] and the promise was to go back to the
[45:00] promised land,
[45:04] which is Canon.
[45:05] Then in the first second exodus
[45:09] there was also a promise
[45:11] and the promise was the baptism of the
[45:13] Holy Spirit
[45:16] which they received on the day of
[45:17] Pentecost.
[45:20] Now we are in the third exodus
[45:24] and the promise of our day
[45:27] is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[45:30] but the promise of the day
[45:33] change of our bodies.
[45:36] Praise the name of our Lord. The promise
[45:38] we have today,
[45:40] change of our bodies
[45:42] from this motor body,
[45:44] this mortal body that is our target.
[45:48] Praise the name of our climax.
[45:52] You know the change of our bodies, our
[45:55] full redemption
[45:58] because our full redemption
[46:01] comes when these bodies
[46:04] can no longer die. When these bodies can
[46:08] no longer fall sick, when these bodies
[46:12] can no longer, you know, grow old.
[46:15] That's the promise that we have.
[46:18] Second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:21] will come. Praise the name of our Lord.
[46:25] The Bible says I show you a mystery. We
[46:29] shall all not sleep.
[46:31] So the promise of our day.
[46:36] Praise the name of our
[46:38] target.
[46:40] That's the promise we have. And then you
[46:44] can't get INTO THE CHANGE OF YOUR BODY.
[46:47] You are not born again.
[46:50] You are not baptized with the Holy
[46:51] Spirit.
[46:55] He's not stopping at the baptism of the
[46:57] Holy Spirit.
[46:59] Praise the name of our go beyond that.
[47:03] And that COMES BY THE SPIRIT HIMSELF.
[47:07] You are born by the spirit.
[47:10] You grow by the spirit. You are adopted
[47:13] by the spirit.
[47:15] And you know adoption.
[47:18] The Bible says in re in
[47:20] Romans chapter 8,
[47:25] praise the name of our Lord.
[47:29] Romans chapter 8 and then verse 23.
[47:35] We can start from verse 21.
[47:38] It says, "Because the creature itself
[47:41] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[47:44] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[47:47] of the children of God.
[48:06] For we know that the whole creation
[48:09] groanth and travails in pain together
[48:12] until now.
[48:20] And not only they but ourselves also
[48:24] which have the first fruits of the
[48:26] spirit. Even we ourselves
[48:29] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[48:33] adoption to it the redemption of our
[48:36] bodies.
[48:51] That is the promise we have before us,
[48:54] our target,
[48:57] our climax.
[48:59] Praise the name over there. So we are in
[49:01] the third Exodus.
[49:04] So we go back to that message, the third
[49:06] Exodus
[49:08] and then paragraph 301.
[49:14] And he is bringing them from the
[49:16] spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:24] right back into the eternal land of the
[49:27] millennium
[49:30] and the great here after
[49:37] same pillar of fire
[49:40] by the same anointed
[49:45] The same God doing the same things.
[49:49] And the same word
[49:52] declares the first one
[49:56] declare the second one.
[49:59] The same word declared the second one
[50:03] has declared the third one.
[50:08] And here we see it among us.
[50:13] Come out of this chaos.
[50:17] Come to the living God.
[50:19] Come to the word.
[50:22] Praise the name of our Lord. We are in
[50:24] the third exodus.
[50:27] And now as we are in the third exodus,
[50:31] they are also opposing spirits
[50:36] that hinder us
[50:38] or are fighting us.
[50:42] going forth the children.
[50:44] Praise the name of our Lord. We see here
[50:47] that in the time of Moses
[50:50] that there were men of renown.
[50:55] There were men of renown.
[50:58] There were men of renown
[51:02] war.
[51:04] the Koras,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; the Dan,
[51:08] &gt;&gt; the Abberam,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; they were renown among the congregation.
[51:15] And now when they reached along the
[51:17] journey,
[51:19] they never had a clear vision of what
[51:21] the Exodus is about.
[51:27] And then they tell Moses, "Why do you
[51:30] take it upon yourself too much?"
[51:34] You know we are holy.
[51:37] We are also anointed
[51:40] where the promised land is.
[51:44] You know they started
[51:47] opposing Moses.
[51:50] Praise the name of our Lord.
[51:53] You know it's just the same thing like
[51:55] when you look at the natural governments
[52:00] like the different governments
[52:03] if you start seeing that this leader is
[52:05] not worthy
[52:08] or you start saying this leader is not
[52:10] worthy
[52:15] and you start doing things contrary to
[52:18] the leadership.
[52:20] They say it is prayer zone.
[52:26] And so we see
[52:30] Abraham
[52:32] &gt;&gt; resisting the leadership of Moses.
[52:36] They wanted to take over.
[52:39] So now in verse 12,
[52:42] Moses goes and tells them, "You bring
[52:44] them
[52:50] sons of
[52:53] which said
[52:55] we will not come up.
[53:00] Now you can imagine they rejected the
[53:03] leadership of Moses.
[53:06] Said we don't care what you're doing.
[53:09] We are not going to obey you.
[53:12] We are not going to hear what you're
[53:14] going to say.
[53:16] Opposing spirit.
[53:19] And then verse 13
[53:22] It is a small thing that thou has
[53:24] brought us up out of the land that flows
[53:26] with milk and honey to kill us in the
[53:29] wilderness, except thou make thyself
[53:32] altogether a prince over us.
[53:51] Now you see they are preaching now
[53:55] telling him where we are from Egypt
[54:00] it's better than where we are
[54:03] you promising take us
[54:08] you know where we are from is enter
[54:13] opposing
[54:16] verse 14.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Moreover, thou hast not brought us into
[54:20] the land that flows with milk and honey,
[54:23] or given us inheritance of fields and
[54:25] vineyards, wo put out the eyes of these
[54:29] men, we will not come up.
[54:50] Praise the name of our Lord. They
[54:52] opposed Moses.
[54:54] They resisted Moses.
[54:58] And we have the same spirits now
[55:02] that can come amongst us
[55:05] and say let us go back to the
[55:07] denomination.
[55:10] The message there is nothing good
[55:13] making you look back.
[55:17] You know the spirit of flowies makes
[55:19] people to look back
[55:24] the denomination
[55:26] going back to what you've been in
[55:29] and you know convincing the people
[55:33] turning the people against you.
[55:38] And so even now any form of spirit
[55:43] that makes you put the message aside
[55:50] or makes you
[55:52] praise the name of reject the authority
[55:56] of the messenger in an age
[56:02] like Kora and
[56:06] they were actually resisting ing the
[56:08] authority of Moses.
[56:13] They were questioning the authority of
[56:15] Moses.
[56:19] Jesus will always be there in any
[56:21] Exodus.
[56:24] They were there during the time of Moses
[56:28] questioning the authority of Moses.
[56:34] People not obey what Moses was telling.
[56:39] In the time of Jesus Christ,
[56:42] the spirits were there
[56:44] questioning the authority of Jesus
[56:46] Christ.
[56:50] The Pharisees came to Jesus Christ
[56:54] and then told him by what authority
[56:57] do you do those miracles?
[57:01] Not that they wanted to believe.
[57:04] No, because they rejected him. And when
[57:08] Jesus told them the baptism of John,
[57:13] was it of men or of God?
[57:17] You see the politics that they played?
[57:20] They went aside from the people and then
[57:23] they started discussing.
[57:25] If we tell him, the baptism of John
[57:30] was of men. the people will will throw
[57:34] stones at us
[57:36] because the people knew that John was a
[57:38] prophet
[57:41] and they said but if we tell him
[57:44] that the bapt of John was of God
[57:48] he's going to ask us why didn't you
[57:50] believe John
[57:53] when John was there
[57:55] they sent people they came to him
[57:59] &gt;&gt; and asked him who are you
[58:09] questioning the authority of the
[58:10] messenger.
[58:13] So were questioning the authority of
[58:16] Moses.
[58:19] The Pharisees were questioning the
[58:22] authority of John the Baptist.
[58:27] They were questioning the authority of
[58:29] Jesus Christ.
[58:32] So even in this third exodus,
[58:36] spirits rise up
[58:38] to question the authority of brother
[58:40] Brana,
[58:44] you know, to make you doubt the
[58:46] messenger.
[58:52] Don't hear him. There are other people.
[58:56] We had a prophet the other side
[58:59] messenger.
[59:01] We have this kind of thing.
[59:05] Opposing spirits.
[59:07] Praise the name of Lord. They come to
[59:10] question
[59:12] to make sure that you doubt your faith.
[59:17] And that's what the devil did at the
[59:20] beginning
[59:23] in Genesis chapter 3.
[59:27] The serpent came to Eve.
[59:30] to question the authority of God,
[59:37] you know, to kind of like resist
[59:42] to question is that to doubt
[59:46] to make sure that you doubt your
[59:49] decision making
[59:53] like you know these people who stud the
[59:56] people
[59:58] They tell you a manipulator.
[1:00:11] They when they come to you, they come to
[1:00:15] make you doubt
[1:00:17] your decision making.
[1:00:21] You doubt your right decision.
[1:00:26] They manipulate you and put you in a
[1:00:27] condition where you are you you are
[1:00:29] confused
[1:00:34] and like now they meet you at Gaddafi
[1:00:36] roundabout
[1:00:40] and then you've already taken over.
[1:00:41] You're almost reaching the crossing of
[1:00:43] the railway.
[1:00:46] Then they tell you
[1:00:51] you don't even know the way which goes
[1:00:53] to town. Then you try to look back,
[1:00:56] they confuse you there and if you hear
[1:01:00] them, they'll end up taking you away.
[1:01:04] That's what the serpent was doing.
[1:01:07] The serpent came to Eve and said,
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; "Now the serpent was more subtile than
[1:01:16] any beast of the field, which the Lord
[1:01:18] had made, and he said unto the woman,
[1:01:21] yeah, has God said, you shall not eat of
[1:01:25] every tree of the garden?
[1:01:45] So they question you.
[1:01:48] They put you into a state of doubting
[1:01:50] what you know.
[1:01:54] Like they can come and tell you
[1:01:58] were you there when they were revealing
[1:02:01] the seven seals.
[1:02:08] Opposing spirits
[1:02:11] like now they come and ask us
[1:02:15] can you show me in the Bible?
[1:02:21] Now when you tell them that okay John
[1:02:24] the Baptist was talked about
[1:02:27] was spoken of in the Bible
[1:02:30] in the old testament
[1:02:32] but in the his name is there in the
[1:02:34] Bible what about this one
[1:02:38] they come to see
[1:02:41] AND THEY SAW DOUBT IN YOUR soul
[1:02:46] that's what the devil does all the time
[1:02:50] this is what do and they were doing.
[1:02:54] Don't receive what he's telling you.
[1:02:59] You know, trying to tell you
[1:03:02] that what you have is not worth.
[1:03:06] So, we need to be convinced.
[1:03:10] We need to be convinced.
[1:03:13] The message that we have received
[1:03:17] is of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:19] Now if you have doubt in your mind,
[1:03:23] you'll be taken up by those spirits.
[1:03:26] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[1:03:28] it is important
[1:03:32] to know. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:03:35] Message that we have got.
[1:03:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Doubt in
[1:03:41] your mind.
[1:03:44] Don't hear somebody to come and tell you
[1:03:45] and confuse you.
[1:03:49] And now some people they may end up
[1:03:52] going to internet
[1:03:57] but Google has every funny thing which
[1:03:59] is there
[1:04:01] but we have the message books
[1:04:05] which are completely not edited
[1:04:11] but it is exactly the voice of God.
[1:04:16] Take time and read things
[1:04:19] about the messenger.
[1:04:22] Praise the name of Lord. Now, if you
[1:04:24] don't know about the messenger,
[1:04:27] then somebody will confuse you.
[1:04:30] Somebody will come up with something and
[1:04:31] then you'll end up following that.
[1:04:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So, they
[1:04:38] were blackmailing Moses.
[1:04:41] They were blackmailing Jesus.
[1:04:44] Even now they blackmail the prophet.
[1:04:49] Satan that is his business.
[1:04:52] He will do all he can do to discredit
[1:04:54] what you believe.
[1:04:59] If you don't have faith
[1:05:02] in what you have and now when you doubt
[1:05:05] what you have
[1:05:08] then your protection is taken away.
[1:05:12] That's what the devil does. That's what
[1:05:14] the devil did to Eve.
[1:05:16] Brother Brham said the devil attacked
[1:05:19] the word
[1:05:22] and the word is our protection.
[1:05:26] So now when you lose faith in the word
[1:05:32] then you have lost confidence in your
[1:05:34] protection.
[1:05:42] You know you feel like you can't
[1:05:44] overcome by what you have.
[1:05:48] So now the Bible tells us that false
[1:05:52] prophets
[1:05:53] and false Christ
[1:05:56] shall come. And we are living in the
[1:05:59] days of false prophets
[1:06:03] and false Christ.
[1:06:05] Their coming is not in vain.
[1:06:10] They achieve what they are up to.
[1:06:15] Let us go to M chapter 24.
[1:06:18] Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible
[1:06:21] says in verse 11,
[1:06:25] "And there many false prophets shall
[1:06:28] rise and deceive many.
[1:06:35] They are not their coming is not in
[1:06:37] vain.
[1:06:39] So you must be guarded.
[1:06:42] How will you tell this is a false
[1:06:44] prophet or this is not a false prophet?
[1:06:50] You must test by the word of God.
[1:06:54] Praise the name of God. So the Bible
[1:06:57] says they shall deceive many.
[1:07:01] And because iniquity shall abound,
[1:07:05] the love of many shall works called.
[1:07:13] So when the false prophets come,
[1:07:17] the level of iniquity,
[1:07:21] the amount of iniquity
[1:07:25] increases.
[1:07:27] That's what they do.
[1:07:29] They make sure that iniquity continues
[1:07:32] on.
[1:07:34] Even somebody who do repent,
[1:07:41] they refuse
[1:07:47] I think I'm see I'm seeing an error in
[1:07:50] him.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; He has a mistake.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil does.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; He makes sure that he casts doubt on
[1:07:57] what you have.
[1:08:02] So he says that many
[1:08:05] their love shall works cold
[1:08:09] their first love for God.
[1:08:13] Now you look at your condition.
[1:08:16] What is your zeal
[1:08:19] to read the message of the hour?
[1:08:23] Praise the name of. If we said how many
[1:08:26] have taken time to read the message this
[1:08:28] week,
[1:08:33] you find you are challenged.
[1:08:37] Maybe other than hearing it in church.
[1:08:42] Every morning we have a morning
[1:08:43] exaltation.
[1:08:47] Now if you ask somebody
[1:08:49] what church age are we on?
[1:08:57] I think we are still on then you know
[1:08:59] that one had about 6 months ago.
[1:09:09] They don't know what's going on.
[1:09:12] you know too busy
[1:09:15] you know that there is no time for God
[1:09:20] and these are the days we are living in
[1:09:23] you know so many things have taken our
[1:09:25] attention
[1:09:28] until we are failing to do what we are
[1:09:30] meant to do
[1:09:34] you find you are too busy
[1:09:37] you can't sit down for 30 means
[1:09:42] and listen attentively
[1:09:46] exaltations that we have.
[1:09:49] You don't have that time.
[1:09:52] You know you you find yourself you are
[1:09:54] involved in so many affairs of life.
[1:10:00] So you get yourself you're used to doing
[1:10:01] things which are wrong.
[1:10:07] And then the Bible says
[1:10:09] iniquity shall abound.
[1:10:12] And when iniquity abounds
[1:10:16] when iniquity increases,
[1:10:19] the love
[1:10:21] just goes down.
[1:10:24] No more time to pray.
[1:10:26] No more time to testify about the Lord.
[1:10:30] That's the condition we are living in.
[1:10:33] Those are all opposing spirits
[1:10:37] to fail you
[1:10:39] to reach your adoption.
[1:10:43] Until you doubt,
[1:10:45] you are afraid.
[1:10:47] You don't know where you stand.
[1:10:50] You don't know what to do. You are
[1:10:52] troubled like the rest of the world
[1:10:55] because the love of God has waxed cold.
[1:11:02] Praise the name of the Lord. But then
[1:11:04] the Bible says in verse 13,
[1:11:08] "But he that endures unto the end, the
[1:11:11] same shall be saved.
[1:11:18] That means that the stration that are
[1:11:21] coming to challenge users,
[1:11:24] false prophets will come
[1:11:27] the you know people who are contrary
[1:11:29] will come
[1:11:33] able to endure.
[1:11:36] Will you be able to overcome them?
[1:11:39] Will you be able to detect them?
[1:11:43] The Bible says even now the spirit of
[1:11:46] antichrist works.
[1:11:51] It has already come out.
[1:11:53] It's already in the world.
[1:11:57] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in this
[1:12:00] in the in the book of first John chapter
[1:12:03] 4,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[1:12:10] "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[1:12:13] try the spirits whether they are of God,
[1:12:17] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:12:20] into the world.
[1:12:39] The Bible says, "Try the spirits."
[1:12:44] You've heard something.
[1:12:47] Is it correct?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Lord.
[1:12:51] Then the Bible says the false prophets
[1:12:54] have gone out
[1:12:57] and now they want you to lose focus.
[1:13:02] They want you to lose confidence in the
[1:13:05] message.
[1:13:08] They want you to lose confidence in the
[1:13:10] messenger.
[1:13:13] You know, you start doubting what you've
[1:13:15] heard.
[1:13:17] You start doubting the messenger.
[1:13:21] You start ignoring what the messenger
[1:13:24] says
[1:13:34] then you start coming having that kind
[1:13:36] of imagination
[1:13:39] in the denominational world.
[1:13:42] You mean if I'm not baptized I will go
[1:13:44] to hell?
[1:13:48] That's what they do. Then you also take
[1:13:50] it lightly.
[1:13:53] You mean if I'm a woman and I put on
[1:13:55] clothes, you know, God can feel bad.
[1:14:01] You know you despise
[1:14:04] what you stand for
[1:14:07] and then you take the way of
[1:14:12] you know anything that is contrary to
[1:14:14] the word of God
[1:14:19] is anti
[1:14:24] is antichrist.
[1:14:28] So the Bible says in verse two,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; hereby know the spirit of God. Every
[1:14:34] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:14:37] is come in the flesh is of God.
[1:14:56] And every spirit that confesses not that
[1:14:59] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:15:02] of God.
[1:15:26] And this is the spirit of the antichrist
[1:15:28] whereof you've heard that it should come
[1:15:31] and even now already is in the world.
[1:15:43] Praise the name of the Lord. Antichrist
[1:15:46] is around
[1:15:49] you know opposing spirit.
[1:15:52] Then he says in the Lician church age
[1:15:57] page 329.
[1:16:00] The second thought that must be
[1:16:02] impressed on our hearts is that the
[1:16:06] seven church ages.
[1:16:09] The second thought
[1:16:11] that must be impressed on our hearts
[1:16:17] is that the seven church ages
[1:16:22] started with the antichrist spirit
[1:16:27] as well as the holy spirit who is the
[1:16:30] blessed forever.
[1:16:35] 1 John 4:1
[1:16:39] John 4:1
[1:16:43] Beloved, believe not every spirit,
[1:16:48] but try the spirits
[1:16:51] whether they are of God
[1:16:54] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:16:57] into the world.
[1:17:01] Did you notice it?
[1:17:03] The antichrist spirit
[1:17:07] is identified with the false prophets.
[1:17:14] Praise the name of Allah. False prophet
[1:17:18] will tell you something against the
[1:17:21] word.
[1:17:23] You lose faith in the word.
[1:17:28] and the false prophet
[1:17:30] had the same spirit
[1:17:32] as the antichrist.
[1:17:35] The ages
[1:17:38] came in with false prophets
[1:17:42] and they will go out with false
[1:17:44] prophets.
[1:17:47] Now, of course, there is going to be a
[1:17:50] real false prophet in the grand sense of
[1:17:52] that man.
[1:17:55] mentioned
[1:17:58] in Revelation.
[1:18:01] But as of now before his revelation
[1:18:06] there appear many false prophets
[1:18:12] in Mark chapter 24
[1:18:14] and then verse 23.
[1:18:18] He says,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; "Then if any man shall say unto you,
[1:18:24] lo here is Christ,
[1:18:29] believe it not."
[1:18:32] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:18:35] Is here. Oh, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU
[1:18:38] can be delivered.
[1:18:41] Is the only place you can be delivered.
[1:18:44] Says, "Don't believe it. For there shall
[1:18:47] arise false Christ,
[1:18:51] false prophets,
[1:18:53] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:18:58] in so much that if it were possible,
[1:19:02] they will deceive the very elect,
[1:19:08] behold, I have told you,
[1:19:11] wherefore, if they shall say unto you,
[1:19:17] He is in the desert.
[1:19:21] Go not forth.
[1:19:24] Behold, he is in the secret chambers.
[1:19:29] Believe it not.
[1:19:31] It's a warning that we have now.
[1:19:34] Praise the name of God. Now, in the
[1:19:37] message, the third Exodus,
[1:19:41] you look what the impact of opposing
[1:19:43] spirits
[1:19:54] paragraph 306
[1:19:57] in the message that Exodus
[1:20:00] in the days of the coming out of Israel
[1:20:05] out of two and a half million people.
[1:20:14] Only two made
[1:20:17] the land
[1:20:21] opposing spirits.
[1:20:24] The Bible says they shall deceive very
[1:20:26] many.
[1:20:28] They entice.
[1:20:30] They obstruct.
[1:20:32] They make you lose your focus
[1:20:36] until you don't get the clear vision of
[1:20:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:20:41] In the days of Jesus Christ, there was
[1:20:44] about
[1:20:46] 120 that made it.
[1:20:51] But how many people had the ministry of
[1:20:53] Jesus?
[1:20:55] How many were healed in the days of
[1:20:57] Jesus?
[1:21:00] Only 120
[1:21:03] were able to obey the voice
[1:21:07] and go and wait in Jerusalem for the
[1:21:09] Holy Spirit.
[1:21:12] Then he says, "And now in the days of
[1:21:14] the ending of the world,
[1:21:20] straight is the gate,
[1:21:24] and narrow is the way,
[1:21:27] but few there will be
[1:21:32] that will find it.
[1:21:35] But broad is the way
[1:21:39] that leads to destruction.
[1:21:43] How many will go in?
[1:21:46] The words cannot fail.
[1:21:50] See the time we are living in. How many
[1:21:53] people call themselves born again?
[1:21:56] The churches that we have,
[1:22:00] how many are standing by the truth.
[1:22:03] Praise the name of our Lord. any one of
[1:22:05] them of the many who claim
[1:22:09] count yourself that among the few that
[1:22:12] the Lord is coming.
[1:22:16] Praise the name of Lord. We are living
[1:22:18] in the challenging time.
[1:22:21] There are many spirits that have come
[1:22:23] out
[1:22:25] and they come out in different forms.
[1:22:29] Praise the name of our Lord. They can
[1:22:31] come out to move along,
[1:22:36] you know, moving along the group.
[1:22:39] There the Bible says
[1:22:41] in the book of Exodus,
[1:22:46] in the book of Exodus,
[1:22:50] let us speak it here.
[1:22:56] Exodus 12:37
[1:23:06] And the children of Israel journeyed
[1:23:08] from Ramses to Circus about 600,000
[1:23:15] foot on foot that were made beside the
[1:23:18] children.
[1:23:34] And then in the verse 38 he says
[1:23:37] and a mixed multitude went up also with
[1:23:41] them and the flocks and the hearts even
[1:23:45] very much cattle.
[1:24:03] Now the Bible says a mixed multitude.
[1:24:10] You know many people
[1:24:13] maybe they heard about Moses.
[1:24:16] They were RUNNING AND SAYING AH WE
[1:24:18] SURVIVED the the the deadly things in
[1:24:20] Egypt.
[1:24:22] Let us go with this mighty prophet.
[1:24:27] Let the water become blood
[1:24:30] darkness for a number of days
[1:24:34] multitude.
[1:24:37] All going
[1:24:40] different attitudes,
[1:24:43] different intentions,
[1:24:45] just a mixed multitude.
[1:24:48] And that mixed multitude
[1:24:51] became a problem in the wilderness,
[1:24:55] complaining all the time,
[1:24:58] complain over this, there's no water,
[1:25:02] there's no food, oh, there's no this,
[1:25:05] there's no this. all the time
[1:25:08] complaining
[1:25:11] from the time I left domination
[1:25:15] I have problems
[1:25:17] or you get many troubles
[1:25:20] I don't know why maybe I look cast
[1:25:24] my friends have left me
[1:25:27] never knew the ways of God
[1:25:32] they despise the way of the Lord
[1:25:36] in Absap 11:6 verse one.
[1:25:42] The Bible says, "And when the people
[1:25:45] complained, it displeased the Lord, and
[1:25:47] the Lord had it, and his anger was
[1:25:50] kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt
[1:25:53] among them, and consumed them that were
[1:25:56] in the uttermost parts of the camp.
[1:26:21] and the people cried unto Moses. And
[1:26:24] when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the
[1:26:26] fire was quenched.
[1:26:40] And he called the name of the place
[1:26:43] because the fire of the Lord burnt among
[1:26:45] them.
[1:26:56] And the mixed multitude that was among
[1:26:59] them fell a lasting. And the children of
[1:27:02] Israel also wept again and said, "Who
[1:27:05] shall give us flesh to eat?
[1:27:23] We remember the fish which we ate in
[1:27:25] Egypt freely the cucumbers and the
[1:27:29] melons and the leaks and the onions and
[1:27:32] the garlic.
[1:27:51] And now our soul is dried away. There is
[1:27:54] nothing at all beside this manner before
[1:27:58] our eyes.
[1:28:03] I don't know.
[1:28:17] You know, they were mixed multitude.
[1:28:22] They never had a clear revelation of the
[1:28:25] Exodus.
[1:28:28] complaining about this, complaining
[1:28:29] about complaining about complaining
[1:28:33] about this.
[1:28:35] They never had faith in God,
[1:28:38] not depending on God at all.
[1:28:41] They had an excuse.
[1:28:44] When this one comes another thing,
[1:28:46] another thing and the devil can put the
[1:28:49] same spirits upon it.
[1:28:51] But you know, for you, you are all the
[1:28:53] time complaining.
[1:28:56] You are not contented.
[1:28:58] You know, you despise the path that the
[1:29:00] Lord has brought you into.
[1:29:04] Go back to the things where you are
[1:29:05] under bondage.
[1:29:09] Spirits that oppose our exodus.
[1:29:14] Praise the name of Lord. So we need to
[1:29:16] see that we overcome all these spirits
[1:29:20] by being obedient to the word of the
[1:29:23] Lord
[1:29:24] and waiting on the Lord.
[1:29:27] You know, you wait on the Lord. You've
[1:29:30] heard the promises of the Lord
[1:29:33] and then wait on the Lord.
[1:29:36] Praise the name of Lord. And you see the
[1:29:38] devil would always want us to despise
[1:29:44] you know
[1:29:46] the things of God. That's what the devil
[1:29:49] systematically likes doing.
[1:29:52] You know when God told Moses
[1:29:56] the 12 spies to the land of promise
[1:30:00] and now when they went to the land of
[1:30:02] promise
[1:30:04] they came back with the first fruits.
[1:30:07] They had an evidence of the land.
[1:30:11] They came with the fruit. They came with
[1:30:13] everything. And then they were carrying
[1:30:15] them before the congregation.
[1:30:18] They had a testimony that the land is
[1:30:21] surely there.
[1:30:23] But then the devil made them look at the
[1:30:25] sons of Anna.
[1:30:30] Those are giants.
[1:30:33] Oh, they are giants.
[1:30:36] We are like grasshoppers.
[1:30:38] We cannot go and overcome them
[1:30:43] opposing
[1:30:45] their exodus
[1:30:47] until they made the whole congregation
[1:30:50] cry
[1:30:53] and they wanted to stone Moses.
[1:30:58] And then they said, "Let us go back to
[1:31:00] Egypt."
[1:31:03] Spirits that oppose
[1:31:06] You cannot live an upright life.
[1:31:09] This this generation is so spoiled.
[1:31:13] How can you be a young girl without a
[1:31:15] boyfriend?
[1:31:22] How can you be a man without a
[1:31:24] girlfriend?
[1:31:27] How can you say you are married to only
[1:31:28] one woman?
[1:31:31] You know, you need to have somebody else
[1:31:33] around.
[1:31:35] There are so many opposing spirits.
[1:31:39] You spend a lot of time going to church
[1:31:43] for us. We only pray for 5 minutes
[1:31:46] and you
[1:31:48] follow
[1:31:50] you. That's why you're going to become
[1:31:53] poor
[1:31:55] and then you start looking at your
[1:31:56] condition.
[1:32:00] I have this trouble even house rent.
[1:32:04] My friend must have said something true.
[1:32:08] Then you start giving lectures of coming
[1:32:10] to church.
[1:32:12] I was online
[1:32:14] whether you're online or not.
[1:32:18] You know the devil
[1:32:21] telling you the land is having giants
[1:32:26] you can't manage. You know for you in
[1:32:29] this life
[1:32:31] praise the name of you know there are
[1:32:33] many challenges that keep on coming
[1:32:37] like I remember when I was going to Toro
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; about I think 20 years ago
[1:32:45] my friend was working here in Ginger
[1:32:50] he was a senior officer
[1:32:53] then he called me to his office
[1:32:56] and then he told me you know you're went
[1:32:58] to local government
[1:33:03] and the things of local government. I
[1:33:06] didn't understand it.
[1:33:09] You see the office in
[1:33:15] I protect.
[1:33:17] So he said but there is a good powerful
[1:33:21] which doctor
[1:33:26] I can take you to helping me.
[1:33:31] So they have many traditions everywhere
[1:33:35] and then now you also here
[1:33:38] and then you go there then one time
[1:33:43] we had planted I think a lot of acorage
[1:33:46] for ginats.
[1:33:51] And then our harvest was very poor. I
[1:33:53] think it was maze.
[1:33:56] One man came with a machine which th
[1:34:03] how many acres did you plant from?
[1:34:06] We told him I said what you've got from
[1:34:08] 10 acres
[1:34:11] I only get it from one acre.
[1:34:15] I ask him how.
[1:34:17] He said, "I have rain makers.
[1:34:22] They just come to the garden and do
[1:34:25] their things and it rains."
[1:34:29] Or maybe they come and stop raining
[1:34:33] like that. Nothing is hurt,
[1:34:37] giants in the land.
[1:34:39] The world does the way it does their
[1:34:41] things.
[1:34:43] But you're not going to do like that
[1:34:46] for you. Why aren't you getting a
[1:34:47] promotion?
[1:34:49] You know, the other wanted me to do
[1:34:51] something funny.
[1:34:53] If you don't do that, you'll just die on
[1:34:55] that level.
[1:34:59] So many things the devil has put around
[1:35:03] frustrate your progress.
[1:35:07] But you know the Bible says greater is
[1:35:10] he that is in us
[1:35:12] than the devil that's in the world.
[1:35:15] You stand faithful to the word.
[1:35:19] Stand faithful to the message of the
[1:35:21] earth.
[1:35:22] And don't allow any situation
[1:35:26] to draw you away from following what the
[1:35:28] Lord has given unto us.
[1:35:31] Praise the name of God. Don't allow to
[1:35:33] hear the false prophet.
[1:35:36] Don't allow to hear the talk of the sons
[1:35:38] of Anarch.
[1:35:42] Then don't allow to hear doras
[1:35:47] to despise the message that we've been
[1:35:49] given.
[1:35:52] Praise the name of our Lord. Even the
[1:35:54] balams will come to do the same signs
[1:35:57] like Moses.
[1:35:59] the same signs like Malachi 4.
[1:36:03] But Malachi 4
[1:36:06] had the voice
[1:36:08] behind the signs
[1:36:10] of these people. They can do signs but
[1:36:14] the voice of God behind.
[1:36:16] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:36:18] stay with the message.
[1:36:21] Praise the name of our Lord. I have to
[1:36:23] stop here.
[1:36:25] May God bless you.
[1:36:28] Amen. [applause]
[1:36:32] Let us sing this song which says
[1:36:36] when the savior calls me as we go to
[1:36:38] pray
[1:36:41] praise the name of our lord. On Saturday
[1:36:43] we have praying and fasting.
[1:36:47] Then on Sunday we have two services.
[1:36:51] The morning services for all of us,
[1:36:54] but then the afternoon services for the
[1:36:56] youth who are in school.
[1:37:01] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:37:04] God bless you. When the Savior
[1:37:08] calls, I will answer.
[1:37:13] When he calls
[1:37:16] for me, I will hear.
[1:37:22] When the Savior
[1:37:25] calls, I will answer.
[1:37:30] I'll be somewhere

[1:38:22] me, if my heart
[1:38:26] is [music] run, I will hear.
[1:38:31] [music]

[1:39:15] [music] listening. I'll [singing] be
[1:39:18] somewhere

[1:39:43] out. If my rock
[1:39:47] is wine, [music]

[1:41:46] for your name is great. Your name is

[1:41:53] given unto us to make us doubt what
[1:41:55] you've given unto us. To make us turn
[1:41:57] our back on what you've given unto us.
[1:41:59] We pray you may help us Lord. Be
