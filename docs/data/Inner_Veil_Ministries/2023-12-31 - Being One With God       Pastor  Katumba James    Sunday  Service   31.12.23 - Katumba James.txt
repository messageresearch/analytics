name of the Lord even our pastor also sent his greetings you just remember me in your prayers his ministering in brother Andrea's church today praise the name of the Lord then there also who went to Convention which started on Friday so you also keep them in your prayers at least I know brother Dan M and his family they went there praise the name of our Lord so today we have two Services we have this morning service and then the afternoon service then immediately after the afternoon service shall start the Lord supper praise the name of the Lord so you just need to keep around and be able to participate in the services of the Lord and as we had said this is the end of the year we thank God praise the name of our Lord and I know there are many places where they prepare to have an overnight and some places are calling it crossovers are calling it Passover praise the name of our Lord and certainly it's good to wait on the Lord even at night but God does not only hear your prayers at night praise the name of our Lord neither does God say maybe you all have to congregate in one place then I hear your prayers praise the name of our Lord so it depends on how different churches are late but for us we believe what we have here is adequate praise the name of Lord and then we thank God for ending this year praise the name of so with effect from next year we are going to have the Lord supper every month praise the name of our Lord now for this month of January which is starting tomorrow we are taking it today praise the name of our Lord as well as ending the but every first Sunday of the month so that will be now in February we shall also have the Lord supper and that will be fourth of February and we want to maintain it like that through the year at the Brom Tabernacle they used to keep it during the time of brother Bram at least every month they used to hold it and then the scripture says in the book of Acts as of as you would they were doing it sometimes even from house to house when you read Acts chapter 2 praise the name of our Lord when never they had a service and we need also to observe these things because the Lord showed us the example and we need to see that you know when we come for the Lord this supper we come waiting on the Lord and during that time of the Lord is supper we also observe the foot washing praise the name of the Lord washing one another's feet being concerned about the other brother praise the name of our Lord not being like C am I My Brother's Keeper praise the name of the Lord so again I want to on two weeks from now that will be on on 14th of January we are going to host Pastor mang from har and we are going to have the two services on that Sunday I would still call upon your contribution just for the sake of having a meal together with all the people we shall invite to come here for that day and then in February also on 11th of February 11th of February shall have brother from Poland also coming to minister us for two services so let us be involved in the kingdom of God don't be weary in good doing praise the name of our Lord don't be tired praise the name of the Lord you know you can buy something with a lot of money and it vanishes immediately but what you put in the Kingdom lasts forever praise the name of the Lord putting your time putting your energy putting your resources all these things will count at the end of the day praise the name of the Lord what we do on Earth will stop here on Earth and they are temporary but what we do for the kingdom is eternal and so we need to see that we learn how to be part of the building of the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord now we want to thank God who gave Brother Joseph and our sister Patricia this week I'm not seeing them around but we thank God for the grace that he has given them amen now let us stand up and go to our scripture reading we are going to John chapter 17 and then we are reading in verse 20 to verse 24 praise the name of the Lord John 17 verse 20 verse 24 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their that they all may be one as th father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent [Music] me and the glory which th Gest me have given them that they may be one even as We Are One i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou Hast sent me and Hast loved them as though Hast loved me father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou L me before the foundation of the [Music] world again Lord we thank you for the reading of the word the scripture says no scripture is of private interpretation it was given by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and we pray the same Holy Spirit Come and speak to us the word of life meeting our needs father you help us to be ready for the rapt that at time in the name of the Lord Jesus amen you may be seated amen so today praise the name of our Lord our brother cus mang is becoming our TR interpreter for the main services praise the name of the Lord I remember brother Jeremiah also started like this when brother was off so brother Jeremiah started the church at and we officially released him so today that's the first day also is starting to hold this service is there fully so just keep him praying praise the name of our Lord I was telling C that you know you need to stand praise the name of the Lord you know not hiding somewhere but just need to come out praise the name of our Lord and we pray that God gives us the grace also to ident identify other gifts praise the name of the Lord that the work may keep on growing I was telling brother cus about about I think about 6 months ago when there was a need and then I told him one thing which happens here any person who comes and stands here either translator or leader they end up becoming pastors praise the name of our Lord so then when you come here come here ready to know that soon you will be a pastor praise the name of our Lord and so likewise when you start standing here you need to make sure that you meet the qualification of being a pastor in your lifetime but sometimes issues of marriage distort that praise the name of the Lord we always tell them you've started this line look forward let your marriage not put you out out of the service praise the name of the Lord so just keep on praying for brother cus praise the name of the Lord so this morning I want to preach on the subject being one with God being one with God praise the name of our Lord being one with God and then we see our Lord Jesus Christ when he was praying he says in verse 21 that they all may be one as though father in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me so we we God desire us to be one with him you know like Christ was one with the Father the father was in him and he was also in the father praise the name of our Lord and God desires that Harmony you know to be to continue in Us Praise the name of our Lord God desires that Harmony you know that it may continue in US it shouldn't stop praise the name of our Lord and then you when you read in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed praise the name of our Lord and then our Prophet says that God had a threefold purpose praise the name of our Lord and now the first purpose led into the second purpose and then the second purpose led into the third purpose I just want to get it here see if I can read it praise the name of our Lord and so but when you look at all these three fold purposes at the end of the day it would make us strive this thought we have today being one with God praise the name of our Lord so our Lord Jesus Christ say as I am in you and you in me now when we read in John 17 verse 23 he said I in them and though in me that they may be made perfect in one praise the name of our Lord and that's the intent of God that we can be one with God praise the name of our Lord and if we are saying that we are one with God we also need to be one with one another in verse 22 it says and the glory which thou Gest me have I given them that they may be one even as we are one so you see how the Lord desires us that we may be one praise the name of of our and you know God has given us various examples where Oneness can be made the first example a wife and the husband they become one but yet these are individuals but yet their heart have to be NE together praise the name of our Lord their heart have to be KN together their feelings have to be one their understanding have to be one their dwelling place has to be one praise the name of the Lord you know there are some people who marry and put their wives in The Villages and then for him is in town then you ask him why did you marry her she's meant to be where you are but says are you going to be with my parents while for me for him is the other side that's not it when God called Abraham brother Bram says when calls a man he calls him with his wife so Abraham didn't leave Sarah and sah let me go this way they had to go together Oneness praise the name of our Lord you look at even this sports sports you know like football you know it has 11 players and those players are trained to be one they are trained to have the same mind they are training to coordinate and the goalkeeper is trained that anything he does is saving the whole team and the whole club but if the goalkeeper doesn't care the whole team loses it doesn't matter how much they are striving if he careless and you know the way they say that the strength the strength of a chain is at its weakest point so the weakest Point illustrates the strength of the chain it may be heard everywhere but if it gets only one point and it can break then it is weak and you know one thing which is weak is water you know it just disintegrates anywhere you know and then Jacob was telling his son Reuben as weak as water praise the name of our Lord now Oneness God wants us to be one as a family you need to be one the husband and the wife have the same mind the parents bring your children to appreciate your mind and let your children grow up in that mind and even now here also as a church we need also to be be one praise the name of the Lord we need to be one we need to be take interest in the activities of the church praise the name of our Lord I would give maybe examples if we are as a church we have an activity we have said we are going to do and then for you say I have also M you're not demonstrating that Oneness praise the name of our Lord we say maybe we are going to have visiting Minister come and let us support that meeting together as one it will be like a family maybe in a family there's an introduction or there is a wedding and you as a family member say that time I have also a trip how does it look like in the family your brother is going to wait or your sister is going to introduce and then you say me I'll be going for a trip somewhere there's something wrong in that kind of so even us as church we need also to be one prise the name of our Lord avoiding the things that divide us avoiding the things that hurt us as a body praise the name of the Lord like the Bible says the body is one but there are so many members of the body there is the eye there is the mouth there is the neck and then the legs and the hands and if any body suffers pain the whole body feels it the whole body is concerned and this is what the body of Jesus Christ should we need to be concerned if one member is sick concerned about that member if one member has a need be concerned about that member if one member is failing be concerned about that member if one member has a kind of distress come and stand together with that one member in prayer in encouragement in support in whatever kind of thing it is praise the name of you know you're not going to go to the rupture alone it's the body that's going to be ruptured praise the name of our Lord so we need to be concerned about one another praise the name of our Lord so now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says we want to find out what is the three-fold purpose the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity could not he's too great to ever be revealed to the people it could be too mysterious he wanted to express himself iying himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ now you see the purpose of the Lord he wanted to reveal himself to the people but he so great praise the name of the Lord you know when you think about the greatness of God it is so amazing praise the name of our Lord you know like yesterday this this weekend have been trouble and even most of this month of December I've been traveling to many places and then you go to a certain place and then you look at how people have developed it so how beautiful is this place and then you see how people have worked on it to improve it and you know some places are high others are down others are playing and then you start admiring such places and then what comes to my mind this point here is part of the earth even where I live is part of the earth praise the name of the Lord so then you start wondering what's now the difference it's the same as praise the name of our Lord and then you see you go to other places or you hear some other places but it is the same God who has made them and has also made this place so what the difference I need to thank God for where he has put me praise the name of our Lord and then you say Lord I Thank you and then you know that your place without your place the Earth cannot be complete praise the name of God has made it so then you just be happy for where God has placed you but now you look at this God said the earth and the fullness thereof is mine the Heaven and the fullness thereof but then he humbles himself and then he comes to you and then he says I want want to be in your heart I want to live in your heart you just imagine the crate of the heavens and the Earth coming down to your level praise the name of our Lord and this is what God was doing he humbled himself and then he was born of a woman yet is the creator of the heavens and earth but he humbled himself he became a baby praise the name of our Lord Jesus crying in the hands of Mary praise the name of the Lord Jesus learning how to talk Jesus learning how to walk how you can you imagine that how the Lord humbled himself let us go to Isaiah chapter 9 praise the name of Isaiah 9 and verse you see prophecy is a very interesting thing in verse six he says For unto us a child is born now you see a prophet he was seeing a vision and then he saw Mary giving birth to a child a child is born but you know you don't know the child is a male or a female and then if afterwards SE his a son so the prophecy or the vision it was Progressive revealing more of what it is a child it is a son and then he saw the son he saw the son growing up and then he says this son here the government is on his shoulders and then he kept on watching and say his name is called wonderful not only wonderful but counselor then says Ah again this child who has been born who is the son he's the Mighty God you know it kept on progressing the Mighty God Everlasting father praise the name of our you see how God humbled himself he came down to our level to be born the way we are born the name of the Lord that should always encourage you and you need to love the Lord much he came down to our levels and then brother Bram says he was too mysterious that he wouldn't reveal himself in that kind of Glory he was in so he condescended and he became a son he was born he was born in our B praise the name of our Lord now when he was born in our midst then we could be able to understand him we could be able to believe him we could be able to accept him and say Lord Jesus come in my life come and take over all my weaknesses come and take over all my failures praise the name of our Lord so in that message Christ the Myster of God revealed he says the first thing that God wanted reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah who covered all the space Time and Eternity he could not he too great to ever be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious he wanted to express himself Iden himself with human beings reveal himself in Christ then secondly to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bright that he might live in the people then he says first reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodly and then to bring that fullness of godhead Bly into the people that he could have Preen the oversight and the leading thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightful position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowed with them so the first purpose revealing himself in Christ God being born in man God as a man and now when we see Christ then Christ dies for our sins accept him as our personal Savior and then you allow him in your life then God could have preeminence in us that we are not our own but we are of God so God coming down in our life and now when God comes down in our life then he restor us to the condition the way it was before the fall praise the name of our Lord so now God wants us to be one with him praise the name of our Lord he wants that Oneness the mind of Christ to be in Us Praise the name of our Lord let us go to Philippians chapter 2 and then verse one the scripture says if there be there for any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any boils of Mercy fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind for praise the name of the Lord he says if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercy he says fulfill my joy be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord being of one mind that's what the scripture is telling us be like minded have that mind of Christ you know we are living in very challenging times and we all go through different travs you find this trouble has come here then you find another trouble has come but you see God wants us to have the same mind praise the name of our Lord he doesn't want us to be [Music] highed highed that's the order of the world but now as children of God he wants us to be likeminded [Music] humility praise the name of the Lord God coming down to Ru in our lives and then saying having one Accord of one mind verse three let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves but look at the time time of competition if this one has got this I also need to have this if this one has got this also need to have this but then he said says be of a lonly mind and esteem the other better than yourself if God has blessed the other with something say Lord we thank you for blessing our not again being hurt no you're not of the same mind desire for the other a better thing than yourself and that's what it should Even in our families but you see the husband wants to hurt the wife or the wife wants to have the husband but you if you are a true Christian allow to take that pain praise the name of our Lord allow to take that pain now I just want us to go into some message here Hebrews chapter 7 1 he says verse paragraph 49 it says Abraham he didn't f with lot he said we are brethren we must not a you now you know when the Servants of lot and Abraham were fighting over the land and water and God had given Abraham all the land but now lot followed Abraham and then the Servants of a lot were fighting with the Servants of Abraham and then Abraham knowing that God has given him all things he told lot no you have the Liberty to choose whever you want to choose if you choose West I'll go east if you choose and then brother Bram says Abraham told him we should not you but lift up your head and go anywhere you want to go if you go east I'll go west if you go north I'll go south that is the Christian attitude praise the name of Lord be willing to give the other man the best of the deal the Fest part where everybody is fighting for brother take it praise the name of our Lord now we need to start challenging ourselves because we talking about being one with God can you forit and give it to another person praise the name of our look at those two prostitutes who gave birth and then one who lost his child she overslept the name of you know when you were parent with babies you lose sleep some some children sleep the whole day and then the whole night they awake so you should be willing to be awake the whole night but now this mother here she slept on her child and the child died so now she immediately imately changed the dead child and then took the living one and they qued until they went to the King Solomon and then everybody was fighting for the living child but the other woman each woman each woman knew that this is my child the other also this one is not my child but one who had lost was fighting for the living and then someone said you bring the sword now when they were going to divide the living child in the middle the mother said no give that child to the other one true attitude genu and then Solomon knew this is the mother of the the other woman who had lost ah yes let us divide to feel let us lose it that should not be a Christian at you also feel the pain I was going through that's not a Christian atud a chrisan would be let them not go through what I've gone through praise the name of our Lord if I have stumbled along the road let me stand here and tell them that point is bad not to stand on the side and see whoever passes and stumbles then I start laughing that's not a Christian but then how many people do that when this brother gets a problem that's not that's not having the same mind we need to have the mind of Christ we need to see that we feel for one another feel for one another you know this brother has G hungry and you have food why don't you got help your brother why don't you help your sister praise the name of the Lord so he says the Christian attitude be willing to give the other man the best of the deal always presented to him let him take his choice praise the name of the Lord and this is the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of Lord you are taking the mind of God you are becoming one with God the way God thinks about the things is also what you are thinking and then you are not only stopping at thinking but you rating it your thoughts are becoming action praise the name of the Lord this is what the Lord wants us to be and we cannot go into the rupture without manifesting the mind of Christ in our Liv praise the name of the Lord be willing praise the name of the Lord you know the rapture it's not the Bibles that are going in the Rapture it's not the message books that are going in the rupture it is the people who have believed the word of God have obeyed the word of God and have demonstrated it in their life who are going in the rupt that's how it is praise the name of our Lord so we better obey all the words we better demonstrate all the word in our lives however heard it may be allow that word to be manifested in you and when the word is manifested in you you are one with God praise the name of our Lord I and my father are one praise the name of our Lord let us go back to Philippians chapter 2 and then verse four look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of the others praise the name of the Lord be concerned about another person be your brother's keeper how is brother so and so how is brother so and so like maybe you hear a brother has not been having a job but now the wife has given birth you have clothes for children why don't you say let me help my brother toess their child maybe he doesn't have where you know to to put maybe where the child is going to sleep and you have these things why don't you be concerned I found brother son so not in a good condition and then you get what you have and then you support another brother praise the name of the Lord you are looking onto another person to see how best you can help them praise the name of our Lord like brother Bram when he was having one of the missions and then he was praying for the people in the prayer line and then there came a blind man and then he looked at him he said this one is would be like my father and then this man didn't have shoes and then he tried to take his feet see if his shoes can fit him he wanted to give him his shoes looking on to the other person praise the name of the Lord we need to be concerned about one another you need to feel the pain of the other brother is going through this I've ever gone through it let me go support my brother let me go stand by my brother praise the name of our Lord and then you know like there are some people who have God has opened opportunities for them praise the name of our Lord that you have access to things and then you know there's a person that is in need or maybe you are in maybe in a certain position of authority at place of work and then there are opportunities of work and then you know there are people who don't have jobs in the family there people in church who don't have jobs oh you think this thing can help why don't you reach out to them and say brother there is this kind of brother there is this kind of opportunity sister there is this kind of can you come and take it over you are look on to the others Affairs you want them to be better that shows that you're not competing praise the name of but want the other person also to be better that's having one mind praise the name of the Lord you are concerned about another then in verse five the Bible says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ yes who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being formed in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross praise the name of the Lord he humbled himself all the glory all the horor himself when he became a son he obeyed his parents praise the name of the Lord wherever he was he followed and observed the word of God and this is the same thing we should also do in our families at our places of world where we live praise the name of our Lord let us allow the word of God to Ru in our lives let us be humble let us wait on the Lord let us depend upon him and then allow God to take over all your life if God is inside of you allow him to have preeminence praise the name of our Lord allow him to lead you allow him to guide you this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord you don't lead yourself but you are LED of the spirit of God humble yourselves let the mind of Christ be in you and then you'll find that you will become the manifestation of the word that you obey it is not difficult it becomes part of you until you are doing things unconsciously but because it is part of you praise the name of the Lord just your life praise the name of the Lord like the Sheep even if you cut off the wool the wool will keep on growing why it is it life and that should be the same thing with us that the word of God is our life praise the name of our lord it's living in you to love your enemy it's not a problem it's not headache is not trouble but you find that you love them you find that you praying for them you are demonstrating that the word of God has become alive in your life praise the name of our Lord you know as we've said it's not the message books that are going in the rupture when brother Bram saw the preview of the Bride there were people but those people become the word of God we also need to become the word of God praise the name of our Lord we deceive ourselves if we are not obeying the word it's in vain but we need to obey that word not only where where people who know us are but even where you are not known and then they see that the life that you live is totally different praise the name of the Lord and that's being one with God in other words you have allowed the word of God in you to put on flesh praise the name of our Lord now in the seven Church age book he says the members of the Virgin bright will love him that is Christ and they will have his potentials for Christ is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads that's the desire of God where your hand subjects the head the head says hand stretch forward and the Hand stretches leg move forward and the leg moves praise the name of our Lord hand you know kind of s the back and then the hand does that there is some I don't want and then the hand PLS It Off praise the name of the Lord he says even us as members of the body of Christ we are subjected to Christ and Christ is the word so we allow the spirit of God to dwell in us and once the spirit of God is dwelling in us then the spirit of God will use us to do the things of God and that shows that you are ready for the Rapture because he's coming to get his own life praise the name of our Lord we should not deceive ourselves where is the life of God you to say that I'm ready for the rupture praise the name of the Lord where is the life praise the name of our Lord you know he says love one another where is your love for the other you need to ask yourself where is my life for my brother where is my love for my sister where is the love for my children love for my husband the love for my wife but you see the Devil comes around and puts hatred but you see hatred is not part of God so you can't hate your brother you can't hate your sister and then you say I am one with God in God there's no hat praise the name of our Lord in God is love those are simple things to check your life praise the name of our Lord like in in English or in chemistry chemistry they say little m test you know there was some kind of paper MBR they used to do and then now it had different colors and then you put it either in acid or in alkaline when it turns this way said this is Turn This is Love for one another chistian praise the name of our Lord very simple do you hate or do you love and then the Lord Jesus says don't be like the publicans they love who love them they give those who give them they those who greet them if you don't hate me I also hate you I don't lose I don't lose that's now outside of the Kingdom but if you are in the Kingdom those who hate you you love them praise the name of the Lord those who can't give you you give them and that's what Jesus said don't invite the rich friends have for your function imagine you prepared a wedding at least in the in the Jewish land whenever a v would come they would give him the same Rob but now you've invited it's a wedding or introdu You' invited maybe the poor neighbors thees are all rugged they are moving bare feet but these days that to get somebody moving bare feet because there is so you can have them and then you but then those are the people he says invite them not somebody com with a very welled look says no there is no reward but the other poor neighbor who doesn't dream of introduction dream of gradation of the child says invite them that's the kingdom he say somebody tells you take me a mile take him to in other words be willing to sacrifice [Music] Beyond praise the name of the Lord that's now the kingdom of God so God wants the harmony like he says here notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown to him by the father and that's what the Lord wants to do in our lives that it's no more my mind it's no more my desires it's no more my ambitions but it's the Lord that is in me that I am following praise the name of our Lord thy will oh Lord that's what I want to do like our Lord's Prayer he says th will be done on us how often every day because say if you going toay this how you pray and say give us today our daily bre so there is a daily portion that the Lord has prepared there is a will of God for that day there is a will of God for your life so then you need to seek the Lord here praise the name of I need to do this kind of praise the name of like just the other week one week ago i' not been around from Saturday up to Tuesday so now when I come back on Tuesday evening and then I F Wednesday I'm going to come to church and then Thursday of course I'm going to be around the whole weekend I'm going to be around that was before Christmas now when I wake up on Wednesday morning I Reed a call and then I was told Pastor is not feeling well and now he says he meant to take the VIS to par I don't know how many days I was not at all and not made a to move that but now here he's down there are meetings in par the visor is meant to preach is meant to preach now when I call Pastor he says I'm not feeling well he says prepare yourself right now there is a morning service come and take the visor and this was around 8:00 in the morning I started wondering you have to make sure the clothes are ready and I didn't know how many days you can imagine that kind of what could I do now you start can I get fuel to move now preparation for the cloes and then now he says be ready also to preach what am I going to preach so you put everything you don't know how many days you're going to be there because you don't have control over the V even Pastor doesn't have control but there is another personing and then you say well you say maybe two days then you prepare for two days said where am I going to sleep praise the name of and then you get the visa you go now when you reach there it is 3 days but you prepared for only one or two days and then the program changes you meant to pick him from par and take him to on Friday and he meant to preach on Friday preaches on Friday praise the name of now when I when that thing just came to my mind Wednesday morning then what came to my mind I am not my own praise the name of you just giving yourself freely for the services of God because he says every day it has it travels today you plan this something different happen but you see you have to be ready to be used of the Lord if he takes you this turn with him you turn with him like even these meetings of I was not it was not in my mind to go there and I not planned it but then you find you are compelled go praise the name of our so God wants to take over our lives praise the name of the Lord look at that man who had the Donkey the man every day would get his donkey he goes and puts it it pasture and he waits for it because are many and he was living in a city then after putting it outside he brings it inside and then one day he has gone to put his donkey there he has never sat on it for one whole yearing his and then now people come here they start removing the donkey then ask them you why are you taking and they tell the master need of praise the name of even us the master need of Us Praise the name of not your plans not your Ambitions but his will praise the name of and that's how the Lord does you know so they they took it and it was for the glory of the Lord because God had made it had created it then he sits on it and Jerusalem and then again another person he has made the upper room so well finished it so well and then these people come now the Masters need to use this place praise the name of that's how the Lord wants to use us and that's how the Lord can bless you if you can give him for the services praise the name of like the other WID woman she goes outside picks some two sticks of firewood and then old man comes to make me a meal say I'm making only one for my son and say no make for me first praise the name of and you see even the rupture it's not going you're not going to pre-plan it because the Bible says two will be in the field for you your plan may be I'm at a place of work praise the name of like maybe brother you will be down below the car trying to open this opening this n and then it comes and you go praise the name of the maybe sister Maria will be teaching in class you teaching now you have plans that day at the end of day you need to go through the market I need to find out this one and then it comes ready you go [Music] not preed at all praise the name of our Lord but we need to allow God to use us we need to allow God to guide us because it says it just comes but the thing is are we ready praise the name of Lord so he says the harmony he showed he he could do what he was only shown by the father then he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in marage The Bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants to be done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has that than the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have th say the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his work he did not complete all his work while on Earth so now he walks through the bright she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which was left for a specific time praise the name of the Lord we need to allow God to take over spirit of God you know to have the same mind of God to be one with God in other words you are obedient to the word you have yielded yourself to the word you are not your own praise the name of our is Christ in you having preeminence in you and that's the desire of God that he can have preeminence in us not my mind not my will not my ambition not my desire but your desire oh Lord praise the name of the Lord let us not be like the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young Ruler he wanted eternal life and when he wanted eternal life he came to eternal life where eternal life was he he came and then he was talking to eternal life what shall I do praise the name of our what shall I do etal life eternal life told the Rich Young go and do ABCD and then he said I've done all this kind of things he said what do I la praise the name of then eternal life told him go and sell all that you have and give to the poor and then come and follow me what did do ah I am my own praise the name of I'm on my own I made this money by myself I read very hard I went to school it's my career development now I have to get more papers I have to apply for a good job I have to do this kind of thing I am of my own he couldn't receive eternal life he wanted to be on his own and then have eternal life can't work like that you have to lose one Lose Yourself that's what the Bible says whoever doesn't lose himself will lose himself at end of the day whoever denies himself your rights your kind of privileges you deny yourself he says shall not lose his life but if you don't deny yourself for the sake of the Gospel you're going to lose it the rich didn't want to deny his possession to give them out freely and say Lord I'm here I want to follow you Lord here follow you what did did do he lost eternal life and then he was in hell and then he was crying oh Father Abraham oh Father Abraham but it was too late for him and he realized in hell that what he worked for he lost everything he lost everything he didn't allow eternal life to be part of him to kind of do you know to kind of do an exchange it was an exchange he say okay give all that you have come and follow me and then I give etern it was hard for him but then look at Moses Moses was to be the next praise the name of Lord Moses was the next Pharaoh he was highly trained in military Andy but then when it came to him that you have to be identified with the Jews praise the name of the Lord he humbled himself and we need to Humble ourselves for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you forit your right you fit your thoughts your imagination and say Lord here I am look at Christ in the garden of Geth not my will but let your will be done praise the name of the Lord we need to become one with God the mind of God to come down and take over our lives that we are not of our own that's what the Bible says we are not of our own we are the Sheep of his pasture he has made us he has created us and he has a purpose for each and every one so we yield to him and say Lord here I am take over all my life as a young person let allow God to take over all your life as a mature person allow God take over all your life praise the name of our Lord let us go to Hebrews 11 and then read about Moses he was also a rich man Abraham he was also a rich man but here Abraham is used to his country he has a big inheritance then the gospel comes in Genesis 12 and verse one leave your country leave all your possessions and come and follow me now you can imagine God telling Abraham to follow him to a place he didn't know but Abraham just followed now maybe Abraham was leaving they were asking where are you going I don't know what are you going to do I don't know but he had to obey the voice and that's the same with us you have to obey the voice of God praise the name of our so here the Bible says in Hebrews 11:3 Hebrews 11 verse 23 rather it says by faith Moses when he was born he was hid three month of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the King's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect and recompense of the reward for praise the name of the Lord look at the Rich Young lul and then look at Moses they were all subjected to the same test Abraham subjected to the simp and we are also subjected to the simp the gospel comes but then you have to choose do I have to live the way of the gospel of Christ or have to live the way of the way of the life the way of the world praise the name of our Lord Moses with a great Glory you know what was ahead of him all promising career going to take over the whole world but he humbled himself and he went and identified himself with the Leist of the people the slaves slavy can you imagine that you're going to be the next leader and you go to the Le of the people the Bible says he esed the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompose of the reward he was looking at something Eternal praise the name of our Lord he was seeing something invisible and that should be the same thing with us the promise of God ahead of us the change of our bodies should be something that excites you now you look in the Natural Life a person will even sell his land everything he has for the sake of his life or his health but then here God has promised us that is going to give us a new body God has promised us that we are not going to see death God has promised us that we are going to live as youth forever but what he wants to do make the choice praise the name of make the choice he says great thingsit us so you must make a decision praise the name of our Lord now in the message a prisoner he says but before I say about Moses I would like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner that's what God does he wants you to be his prisoner not your thought not your ambition praise the name of but to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he has got everything that he is everything his life his soul his body his will his Ambitions and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God praise the name of the Lord we want to become one with God how do we become one with God let us become Pres Us Praise the name of our Lord not my will but your will oh God praise the name of the Lord now I want us to go to another scripture here shall come back to that quot in Mark 12 and then verse 28 says and one of the suas came having had them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them when and asked him which is the first commandment of all Mark 12 verse 28 and Jesus answered him first of all the Commandments is this here oh Israel the Lord our God is one praise the name of the Lord he says is one Lord and this one Lord you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength this is the first commandment he says is one Lord not two Lords not three Lords is one Lord and if he's one Lord he doesn't want you to be a lord of yourself he doesn't want you to become a lord of yourself he wants to be your lord and he wants to be that one Lord of all your heart the desires of your heart he wants to be the Lord he wants to be the Lord of your soul the inside of your soul he wants to be your lord he wants to be the Lord all your mind your thoughts your intents he wants to be the Lord and he wants to be the Lord of your strength the Lord of your body praise the name of our and now when Jesus as the Rich Young Lord love your parents love your neighbor don't steal don't commit adultery he said I'm done all now when he turn to the greatest commandment loving the Lord with all yourself says okay now you go and sell what you have and follow me it was a hard thing giving his life over it was hard for him and we it should not be difficult for us to give our lives to the Lord and say Lord take over all my life take over all my time take over all my resources take over everything that I have because all that I am is because of you Lord so you are allowed to give everything you have fre to God lord everything is here praise the name of the Lord you are becoming one with God you are recognizing that you're not your own you are recognizing I am a prisoner praise the name of let us go back to the court he says You must be a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God you might have to walk contrary to your better judgment maybe in a certain organization you might think that they could lift you up and give you something great that you might flash but do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until God can get that man is willing to become a prisoner to him God is looking for prisoners he has always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you are only connected with Christ and only then God can use you until then he can praise the name of the Lord he's looking for prisoners to yield ourselves to praise the name of the Lord a life that is right a life praise the name of our Lord that will manifest the word of God a life that will manifest the fruit of the spirit we need to have that life in US if God is in us and we are in God if we are one with God we need to manifest the life of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord now in the church age book it says the very same law applies to the church today whatever the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ's seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church super as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this the wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogas mixed with the word praise the name of so God wants us to be the manifestation of the word of God but how are we going to be the manifestation of the word of God we are not one with God the mind of God flowing in us the word of God settled in our heart the spirit of God ruling over us directing us guiding us this is what the Lord wants praise the name of our Lord having preeminence in us becoming the manifestation of the word of God praise the name of our Lord now I want us to read those another let us go to the message T how can I overcome he says so if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ live constantly in the Life of Christ hear the wordy the word you know become that manifestation let God have preeminence in you praise the name of the Lord let us not pretend what we are not let us not pretend serious with the gospel if the gospel says hating is not right why do you hate praise the name of the Lord see that yourself you are clean from within live constantly in the Life of Christ praise the name of our Lord that's what God has called us to be we need to become the manifestation of the word of God now there's also another message here the message how can I overcome my time was gone and I we need to to be able to close by one in the message how can I overcome he says and the graves were opened Graves and many bodies of the Saints slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to many then he says there is that elected not all the Jewish Church came forth at that time all of them made the same sacrifice all of them was under the shed blood of the lamb but there was but there was an elected group and that elected group as soon as the event came that really believed in it with sincerity praise the name of it says now I'm coming to the to the word of now hold that that really overcame sincerely making the same offering the rest of them made but sincerity overcame the things of the world this is now the same challenge we have all of us belies but then who is taking the word of God to be serious he says in the Old Testament they had the same lamb they had the same sacrifices they had the same opportunities but then who were taken up in the rupture are those who were living the life of what was taught of what was given the same thing with that if brother Bram says that if I arue with my brother and after arguing with him I have a bad feeling about him I need to come to the altar how about us praise the name of the Lord some can live a life of hating year one hating year two ha it's a of life there's no rupture for you praise the name of our Lord some can be in a mistake or an error or something wrong and they want Rejoice continuously doing it there's no rupture there praise the name of the Lord you are in something wrong and you continue being something why don't you come out of it praise the name of the Lord the Bible says righteous man falls seven times a but when he falls he rises up for you while are you failing to rise out of your why are you rejoicing in your mistakes why are you comfortable in living evil way why don't you come out of of that situation praise the name of the Lord we have a rupture in our generation but how will it find you praise the name of the Lord Brother Bram says when he went beyond the curtain of time he says it will take perfect love now is our perfect love that's the question we need to ask ourselves let us not be like the was of the let us be serious what we have believed praise the name of let us be serious he said there were many in the Old Testament there were the Jewish Church look at the children of Israel many two millions left Egypt but of the two millions that came out of Egypt only two Joshua and Cal entered the promised land but yet they left Egypt to enter the promised land but many of them God was not pleased with them how about us the one tells us to do this and we don't care about it and this is what we are finding in many people praise the name of Lord not only here but is something all over everywhere gross Darkness First Love Has Gone the desire of God has gone away but yet it is the time where the Bible says blessed is that [Music] servant Lord will find so doing we in the time of the coming of Our Lord praise the name of our Lord we need to check our lives am I living one with God my life reflecting the Gospel of Jesus Christ is my life reflecting the message of the hour praise the name of our Lord we you don't pretend you look at the life of brother BR if he would only tell that lie if we could tell that lie when he told that Li that I'm not in the house or I'm not around and the Holy Ghost was not comfortable with then us today I deceive tomorrow ice it's a of life but then only for him one lie told him you hypocrite until he had to make over it and then we are comfortable you know what you do is you just do like this play like this and we comfortable living like this how are we going to make it in the rupture how are we going to become one with God if the things that have been committed to us we are despising them praise the name of our Lord so we need to check our lives we need to examine our lives and say Lord I want to be one with you I want to walk in the word I want to in the truth I want to be obedient to all the word that should be a personal issue upon me praise the name of God you just need to be one with God let that word have preeminence let that word rule Our lives our thoughts our decisions let the word of God lle in our lives what we talk let the word l our actions let the word praise the name of our Lord we need to be one with God praise the name of our Lord and we shouldn't pretend praise the name of our Lord we shouldn't pretend but we know ourselves Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my fa Lord this is where I need praise the name of we need to be one with God and the one with God has to be manifested by the life that you live by the manifestation of the spirit of God in your life where the spirit has total control you bear the fruit of the spirit the spirit of God works through your life that shows you are one with God praise the name of the Lord may God bless you
