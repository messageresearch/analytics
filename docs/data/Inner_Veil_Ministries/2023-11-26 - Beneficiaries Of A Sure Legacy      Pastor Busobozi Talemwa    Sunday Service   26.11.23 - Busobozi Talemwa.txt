their needs we just yield oursel to you we ask that you come and have your way in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen maybe before we I get to greet you let's just read the scripture and then we will just see we're going to take Proverbs 13 vers just read one a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children his children and the wealth of the sinner is is laid up for the for the is that amen may be seated I'd like to take this opportunity to thank God for the Grace has given us to be here today and I would like to appreciate uh James for opening the pit for us I certainly want to appreciate our Elder P just give the invitation thank you for the confidence that you placed in us to ask us to come and minister to the Saints here well the elders have uh have God has used them to invite us but then you should also invite the word this morning and just open your heart if you make if you keep quiet you'll make me nervous and I will say nothing but but if you say Amen then you will be able to use the gift that God has given to me however little it is and then it can be a blessing to you this morning I we appreciate God for men that God has used for uh for years and years and years you know myself I'm only 32 years old and I've uh preached this message for for about 17 years and that will tell you this almost half my life more than half my life so the message is my life and I just want to you to know that I love the message with all my heart found me when I was on the on the road becoming a priest having ministered um in the Anglican Church for two years as a l preacher the bishop I was leaving with the bishop and he put me to preaching I don't know whether Pastor knew that so I preached for two years in the Anglican Church from the age of 1 years 14 years and then at 15 God sent the message my way and it was not easy for me to accept but but you know there was different encounters that I got and uh but I would just speak of this one specific one uh we were you know I would always go to my Anglican Church very early in the morning and then uh in the mid morning I would go to the message church because I was leaving with the pastor of in the message at the time and uh and so I was forced to go to a message Church in the in the afternoon because we did not I didn't have any other home to go to but you see this one morning when I went to my Anglican Church I was just SE like just over on that door there and there was just like there is here and so we were just standing a woman preacher was on the pull pit and then he you know by here by seeing a preach I already knew it was wrong because I had already heard of it being told to me and then I also saw them baptizing in the back uh there was a Baptist tree how many were in the Anglican Church here raise up your hand you can understand what I'm talking about and they they brought a little child and they said name this child and a Godfather named the child and I started asking the child will you uh you know forit the word blah blah blah blah blah Jesus Christ the little child say but the big man answered when that happened you know I knew this was the biggest deception in the world they're asking a baby but the adult is answering so but then in that moment I began to feel a bit different I was feeling a bit dizzy and I felt that I was almost going to pass out and then a voice came out of a wall of wind that came around my ears and he spoke to me by name find the nearest exit and leave this place you are in the wrong place those were the words I heard and I'm a faithful witness and when I heard those words I could not believe it was only me hearing so I turned around and looked but the third time when that came back I could not resist it I quickly Swang my way out I Pi my B and I Swang my way out and I landed in the message church I had nowhere else to go and uh when I reached the message church I had not yet beli I had decided to to leave the denomination I had not yet decided to join the Believers of the message but here I found a man preaching as if he had CS under his foot you know and he was preaching under a lot of inspiration and you know it was a brother called Paul at the time you know preached my heart melted and and and you know you know just as they were closing the service the same of wind came back and I became busy again and out of that voice out of that wall of wind another voice came and they called me again by my name and he said stand up on your feet raise up both your hands and declare to these people that you have accepted the message and that you would like to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ when when I heard that iated in my Anglican Church I was already ministering I was having I was in good graes with the bishop and the AR Bishop of Uganda I prom to take me to study theology so I can become a priest in the USA so I knew these were opportunities that I was going to lose and I would never get them again the church inana was at that time very little 10 to 15 people with even the iron sheets were leaking sometimes so I was in my heart I was in my mind I was reasoning what here there is no future if I I follow what the voice is telling me I'm ring my life but then again that voice came the second time and that voice came the third time friends I just became very emotional and that's why I always say it's okay to be emotional the holy spirit is not emotional but he is emotional when you receive that experience you become emotional I did not want to be excited or emotional but I became emotional and and you know tears were just coming out of my eyes and and then I I just you know shakingly raised up one of my hands and I tried to shout but I think I couldn't shout and I spoke and said I've accepted this message to be the truth and i' would like to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all the people began clapping and shouting and I was moved I wondered whether it was a great thing for them I was amazed at their Joy friends we should always be joyful when God Saves a sin and so I was saved that day and I was taken to the water and I was baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ at 15 years and when I came out of the water I made a resolution in my heart I said I'm going to go all over the world all over the country wherever the Lord will take and I will tell the people that there is a message in the land and ever since I gave my whole life towards serving the lord and it has been his grace that has kept us this far and at 21 I got married to a beautiful uh damel and who had also dedicated her life to serve the Lord virtuous lady and I appreciate God for how God has blessed us with five children amen and and I'm actually here with her with them can you please stand up yeah that's my wife sister Rebecca and the children over there amen amen and God has been good ever since sent us over to Ethiopia by his grace and I I remember when we first arrived uh uh Sten you were just in that little room uh in Ethiopia and we're praying that God who on our hyon we are praying that the Lord will be able to lead us to his seat one by one he sent them and uh this weekend I was watching some videos they having Bible meetings there with Believers coming from all over the country there are hundreds of Believers in the country country now and uh God has been good sent us back to campala where we currently have been pastoring a work there for the past two years and uh there is h two witnesses from the ministry there there's a brother Samuel where is [Music] hea for Okay so I think you can hear me good brother Samuel is originally from here Ina so when he heard that I'm going to Ginger he said you cannot leave me and uh he loves he loves his region so much his people so much he one time told me ginger is better Thana so then it's good for you to to see the church in Ginger and also with sister fa where is she this young lady is uh she recently believed at uh um at an aviation School in where we we usually go there once a week to minister to the young people there praise God and so God has been good how many can say God has been good to you amen amen so uh I I sent in an invitation uh uh to our youth meetings that is going to take place on 12 to 14th and uh the pastor asked me he said you come and invite the young people and so by my my message this morning I desire to to just invite the young people to come and be a part of those meetings so what I'm going to minister to you this morning is mainly uh targeting the the the young people the youth I know that the ministry here you have a wonderful ministry here that is seasoned over the years I I think uh Pastor Steven has preached over if I'm not wrong you will correct me about 40 years or so and he started preaching the message before I was born and and so to if we had grandchildren in the Lord I'm a grandchild so I have nothing that I can tell you that you've not had before but there is a message that God has given to me an inspiration to bring to especially the younger generation and how many are expect on this morning that's only 2% of you how many expect them this morning for the Lord amen I believe that the Lord will speak to us this morning I hope it's okay to remove my jacket um I have a little subject I want to speak on and I want to speak on beneficiaries beneficiaries of aure legacy praise God praise God praise God I saw brother William somewhere brother William was with us in Ethiopia I remember we went even up to the and baptized a few people there praise God so uh beneficiaries ofua Legacy now I want us to see that the blessing on the life of a good man he is so great enough that upon his death he has enough left to give an inheritance not only to his children but also to his grandchildren maybe some of you seated here have ever inherited something from your father now a legacy is a Heritage now a Heritage is something that is handed down from the past it may be property it may be reputation it may be Traditions it may be positions in life aacy is something that is handed down from the past to another generation if your father had lands or houses or Estes and then he passed away now Legacy is what he leaves you with is what you inherit now a good man lives a legacy a legacy that goes beyond the first generation and On to the Next Generation you know there is listen to me Church there is something that is very serious that not very many people take seriously and that is death death is serious I know we are believers and we are waiting on for the Rapture how many are waiting for the Rapture the rupture will come for sure the rupture is also serious the rupture is going to happen but not many people are going to go in the Rapture even Apostle Paul was waiting for the RT he died believing and waiting we believe we will be ruptur but some of us may go the way of the Grave if the Lord tiries and so death is a reality but many people live as though There Is No Death they only think for themselves and think about themselves they don't think about tomorrow they don't think about what will happen after they are gone and but but but a good man thinks about tomorrow a good man thinks about his legacy and and a good man you know prepares uh a legacy that the generation after him will be able to inherit he wants to be sure there is an everlasting blessing this blessing that he leaves he doesn't listen he doesn't leave it only for the first generation but it comes to the first generation onto the Next Generation and another generation all become beneficiaries of this good man praise the name of the Lord now he does it on purpose and I want to ask you a question here today what will you be remembered for ask your neighbor what will you be remembered for did you know one time right now you may consider yourself a young person but time is coming and it's coming first when you will be an old man when you'll be an old woman when you are stoop shoulder and and you cannot do anything for yourself what will he be remembered for when you are out of this world will your name be remembered anymore what will you leave behind whatever you will leave behind is going to be your legacy if you have a vision it is no longer about you but the Legacy behind you and I want to say thank God for the men of God that had have had Vision this building here this church here this people here they all here because there is a man that had Vision this entire region and many parts in the country been evangelized even me myself I may not have directly come from the ministry here but if this ministry did not go and many others that went out at fast when they had this message and they believed it if they had no vision to continue preaching that message for the Next Generation we will not be here and I want to say thank God for men with vision thank God thank God for and there there have been many men all over the world many Ministry that have had vision for the message to go for but the question is do we have Vision we ourselves many people have Inherited property especially here in our country some of you that have been following the trends of our country you can see that there's been several families that have men that have made a name and a big Fortune when the man died he died in the children would begin selling one by one they would begin selling the lands they begin selling the business they'll begin selling everything all the houses the Estates the car and soon the family gos into poverty why because the generation that came after did not have a vision but when you have a vision you are going to not think about yourself anymore you are not going to be selfish you are going to think about others you are going to think about another generation do you know we have young men and young ladies 20 years 25 and they have even the thought of marriage has never crossed to them when you ask them about it brother I'm still making money and you know we are still seeking for God and we want to be right with God and brother you have no vision sister you have no vision you are not going to wait for you to be married to pray for your husband or to pray for your wife Vision looks to the Future before things happen you see what others are not seeing you begin planning you begin preparing you begin praying you begin doing everything that it takes to prepare yourself for the future and even so not for yourself to prepare for those that will come after you praise God if there is something that white people are better than us is that many of them think about Legacy I was in Zimbabwe recently especially in the guu areas Southern Zimbabwe and and a pastor that was hosting me there saying as we're driving around this was one of the industrial the biggest industrial cities of places in Zimbabwe at the time when the whites were still there the old place was flourishing great compounds great rods the infrastructure but when they left local people you know you know they they they made Gardens the gardens which were with flowers and you know looking so beautiful and they planted Maze and so now you would look around the maze is also a bit a bit a bit red he doesn't look fruitful and he and he told me the brother told me our people only think about food what I will eat today but I don't think about tomorrow there's something that God has given to me to challenge the younger generation and I don't know if I'll preach that much but I just want to deliver it and by by God's grace be able to inspire our young people but you see what what will you be remembered for and let us look at at Ephesians chap 1: 3 we're going to read a few verses out of that blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly bles in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love praise God five having pre predestinated okay let us look at four we read four all right five have been predent as unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will seven in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his [Music] grace having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance praise God being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work all things after the councel of his own way our inheritance is in Jesus Christ Our inheritance is in Christ and I want to say what did he come to do he came down here he came from Heaven to Earth and there's many ways this can be approached and please understand I'm another teacher and so if I don't bring it the way your pastor does understand me please that amen just Spirit receive the way com so listen when he came down he came down from glory and he came down to us what did he come to do he came to establish an everlasting Legacy how did he do that on a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross an emblem of suffering and shame you cannot establish a legacy without suffering and I love that old gross where the Dearest and best for a world of lost Sinners who are slain why was he slain for you and me he wasn't slain for himself he didn't come down here thinking about himself he gave himself for me and you he gave himself so that he can establish Legacy which Rel for all the next Generations it won't be only one generation it will be one generation and another generation and another generation another generation which would be beneficiary of that Legacy don't joke with the legacy of the cross want to say I am a beneficiary he became me that I might become him we are beneficiaries we are more than beneficiaries listen we are trophies we are trophies we are TR trophies that prove his victory you know when you run in the race when you win you get a trophy to prove your Victory are you following when Men of War went to fight they don't just come back empty-handed they come back with swords and Spears and sometimes they even came with heads of their slain enemies in order to prove that they were victorious these were Trophies the things which they brought were were trophies one time you know David went to fight his enemies and uh the you know the king said whoever will kill so many uh Philistines I will give him my daughter and so when David went he killed them he didn't just come back empty-handed he says I've done it he had to have something to show for it you know what that what that was it was the head of thees he had put it in the back so he just open and they had to them make sure it was the right number and that's how he married daughter let me tell you when Jesus Christ suffered and died on the cross what is the prophet what does he have to show for it to show his victory it is not his wounds no it is is not the cross many people you know especially Catholics and other religions they treasure these relics oh the cross oh this all that you know this the cross of Jesus oh no those are not the trophies of this Victory guess who are the trophies we are the trophies you are the trophies we are the trophies his victory we TR of his grace so why because he did it for me he did it for you not for himself he was a man of vision why did he come down to us he was a man of vision he was seeing a vision when they persecuting him he was seeing a vision when they killed him he was seeing a vision a vision of his church a vision of the generations after him will be beneficiaries of the Legacy beneficiaries of the Legacy that he has left behind beneficiaries of sure Legacy a legacy that cannot pass away but stands sure how many have ever inherited something from their parents yes a few brothers and sisters who have raised up your hand you have a legacy which inherited which you can to pass to your next generation the Next Generation after that but not to disappoint you let me say that's it pass away if it is a house it will grow old if it's land it can pass away if it is uh riches it can just disappear in a more in a more but we the bride of Jesus Christ have iner Legacy let me show you our Legacy John 1416 he himself speaks to us and says I will pray that the father and he I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever the one is leaving behind will never go he will abide with us forever it is a legacy even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not but he know him oh my they claim that they can receive the holy spirit in the denominations out there where I have nothing to say about that but I will tell you this we are the right people that have a claim on that we are the right people because he said he shall know him they will not he shall know him and he know him and he will dwell with you and shall be in you why are we the right people because we have receive the word of the hour that is the absolute proof that is the absolute Tru that we are the right people to possess the land oh my God to possess the land praise God listen I will not leave you comfortless meaning I will leave you I'll go away but I'll leave something and I'll not leave you comfortless so whatever is leaving you are going to be a benef you I will come to you yet a little while and the word seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you let me tell you yes these are spiritual things yes these are spiritual things but I want to tell you this if the word cannot come from spiritual to physical then it has no use for us our Prophet say that the physical type the spirit if he is going to come and he says he shall leave it means we are going to receive something eternal but po here on Earth we are also promis Divine Healing we have promised good health we have promised Prosperity we have promised the blessing of God let me tell the blessing of God make us rich and he no let me tell you if you want to be rich just receive this blessing if you want to be rich just be a beneficiary of this Legacy everything you need is right in there if you need healing it is right in there if you need strength for the day is right in there if you need the Holy Ghost is right in there if you need money yes money you are looking at me as if you don't need money if you need money it is right in there everything we need it is right in there it is a promise and I will show you as we come down those who hallelujah hallelujah those who receive this Legacy they oh they need it right in there and this Legacy of Christ becomes you know given over to the apostles and and and it's manifested through the apostles Christ left it to the apostles he say to them that I'll give you I'll not leave you comfortless don't worry you know one day he was with the disciples and one of them asked but Master when you go even before you know we have left the world meaning our parents our fathers shall never give us inheritance when I believe the message my mother disowned me she said she said you're no longer my son my father was no longer there at the time so I had no inheritance nothing zero I don't know if there is somebody like that fear the message because they fear to grieve their parents oh my God if you fear to believe the message to believe the word because you're fearing your you don't know the word you don't know what it is you don't know what it is for his s he that shall not leave his father mother sister brother for me not worthy of why because this is life this is everything you and one day the disciples asked he said what about us we have left everything for you what shall we get he return you know what he answer them but right here he's speaking to them again and he saying uh as for you my children my disciples I will not leave you conf I will leave you something I personal I will come to you I will be with you and I will be in and he says the world will see you but he shall see me why because you know me and I know you I you and you be what the say and on the day of Pentecost the Bible says when the of pentec was fully they were all together in one place what happened the apostles Ministry we see started right here it started right here seven we know the Bible says the Holy Ghost came down as a as a leaks of fire fell upon each of them and they started to speak in Tong and to prophesy and I love when says it this way even Mary the mother of Jesus was there oh my I wish I wish I had some Roman Catholics here today I would tell them this Mary Mary the Mother of God was also there in the upper room and when the Holy Ghost came she started sing speaking in t what did you sayy I thought she was a very you know that of that is another that Mary was in the upper room and she received a portion she received the Legacy she she had a portion in the Legacy and when she received that together with the others they began speaking in Tong they began behaving as let me tell you when that comes to you when the word of God is Quicken to your soul am emotion the emotion outside is only an indication of what has come on the inside and this word is a sure word the B A word of Prophecy he said I'm going to leave you comfortless but I I will come to you and when they when he came that day Peter the man who was fearful before he became so bold and the power of the Holy ghosten and he started speaking with boldness and the Bible says they were preaching their heart and they said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent hallelujah hallelujah tell your neighbor repent how many will preach with me today can tell your neigh P well I'm happy I'm in church this morning and Pastor James told me have your Liberty can I preach like I preach at home we are believers of the message

hallelujah hallelujah he said to them repent repent repent and then he says and be baptized I said it many times because I wanted to go but then I don't have time and then he says be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all flame fire that F at Pentecost which cleans made them clean is burning now with my heart Oh Glory to his name sing with me now I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them we are one of them I'm so glad I can one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise this is the part I wanted now for the promise if you can't tell your neb for the prom is to you to your children that follow as many asone shall call hallelujah hallelujah they received the Legacy the Legacy was mov to the disciples to their children to their children children to all that are those in G in in Ethiopia the world it is a promise that we have inherited listen just stay with me as I build this his message on the basis of what was preached before him you cannot claim you have something but what you have receiv we see many people who claim not have fathers especially at school some children are ashamed of their fathers maybe because if your father is poor or is's not like your friend's father when your father comes and you see him you run and hide and this the same man who is paying your tution that you can have a good future that is physical but also spirit some they they they don't recognize their fathers especially in this message of the hour you are now quiet that we don't recognize our fathers you find younger men younger boys speaking big words speaking Fierce words against ERS their fathers why you cannot claim to have anything other than what you have received and you cannot preach something other than what you have received I want to say we want to be a generation H our fathers that we will have a longer life that is the first commandment promise you know because in the message bam told us that we don't have Bishops or Arch Bishops oh oh we don't have a a PO and we love saying oh you know we are not organized brother we not an organization we are LED only by Jesus on top our head we listen to him wait brother also say we are not an organization but we are not disorganized we are organized just like in a home the woman or the the mother is under the headship of the father or the man also in the church and in the ministry young ministers praise God PA beaut his message on the basis of what was preached before him she was a beneficiary Legacy Act 19:5 and when they heard this they were they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid up his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they SP with Tong and they prophesy and all men were about 12 praise God now a question for you was Paul there in theer room Paul was not there he was not there he wasn't there when the the first Believers Paul came in later but he's saying the same thing where did he get it from he got it from gods that had already been preaching did it undermine PA's position in the body no Paul was an apostle to the Gentiles but even then there was Peter there were others that had been the initial beneficiary of this Legacy but Paul was also within the promise as long as you are a beneficiary of that we are going to see the same thing the same life the same power The Same Spirit listen the same character it will be the same it will not be different the way God works with Paul will be the same way God works wither the way God works with st will be the same way the way he works the walk with me the will walk with you why because we are all beneficiar of the same same Legacy it's not another it's the same same Spirit same character same power same life in the PM Vision but say something here very important he says that's the way the church is and this will be the only what I'll give you and then the rest I'll just give you a few scriptures now so follow me closely now oh I think I have two more I don't know listen it says the vine has been split and limbs have been grafted in they have grafted in Baptists method meod lims and Pentecostal lims like a branch yeah so they those on the vine are you following me and those limbs appearing Baptist meod pcan denomination of seeds from which they produce their fruits but if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like theine itself it will be the same kind of a branch that was brought forth at Pentecost Hallelujah he says it will speak in tongues prophesy have the power and have the sign of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ in it are we that original branch they the Pentecostals they missed it why they had some Dynamics there but they did not have the right mechanics but where is the bride who is the bride the bride through the same Legacy listen from Jesus to the apostles from the apostles to the message of the age same Legacy what have we received we have received the full word of God we have received the full mechanics but not only that not only that we have also received the Dynamics we have received the Dynamics young people mothers and fathers please be with us I want to speak to the young people and to tell you this this word we have received this word has been transferred to us is a it I've seen people come with all their filthy desires with the lust of the world with all the fornications even some with drugs but you know what let them sit under the inspired word of God of the hour is going to produce the same fruit we have them here same way same will happen they say that we cannot have girls marry as virgins listen to me young Ladi you have an opportunity amen if you will not say Amen I'll come to you you have the opportunity the same opportunity that your mother had you have an opportunity to be virtuous like sah was you have an opportunity to live for God you have an opportunity to prove to the world you are the same same Vine the original the original vine same life must come you can live above sin can I have the young people say amen you can live above se you can serve God you can show the world you are a person this world is not worthy of I'm not preaching to you something I learned I am not preaching to you excite you I'm telling you my life what I have lived and I'm not ashamed to say I married woman and I married when I was virtuous also you young people can be the standard of this generation now if the devil go you somewhere well thank God for the Grace Grace is available but when you receive Grace don't call this Grace let the grace of God pull you out of sin and sure the world you are different we are the generation that are benici oh my God I can't say the way I feel it we are the benefici of this Legacy listen what says here listen it will be the same kind of branch that was brought forth at Pentecost what happened on what happened on please what happened they spoke in what happened sorry they receive the power of God what happened on PC the prophesied what happened Pentecost shout mama what they got what they received the God bless you she has Revelation what happen at Pentecost the Holy Spirit at Pentecost this happened we can't dispute it it is in Scripture praise God and we we have received now the same original word which they received and this same word entitles you to receive the same thing they reive he said what did it do it it will speak with Tong prophesy and have the power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it now we are not Pentecostal but we are Pentecostals by experience praise God they only run after signs and and you know em wers and everything but when you watch their life their life is not of the original V that shows you what they have is the fake one where is the original the original is in in ve Ministry the message of we have the original we have the full word of God preaching his right way that we must also have the same power that will heal the sick the same power that will speak in Tong the same power that will change a into a when in ethopia they brought me a man who was half dead he was having TP long story short we simply prayed and God raised him up and what happened they invited us to go to the Village there is no Road there so we used the we we walked and then when we come when we coming back we came on back on horse back my first time we used horses and when we reached there the whole they say we want to see the we want to see the god of the second Lazarus and the brothers thean Brothers told me us let us do a Divine Healing service and preach about healing I told them God did not send me to make Divine Healing campaigns but he gave me the word I'm going to preach salvation and I'm going to preach baptism the name of our Lord Jes Christ I'm going to preach we have a message that same God who healed the brother will vindicate himself and the brothers were very sad said pastor you're ruing the moment we have to show them the power I said no God will show himself they will believe they will not believe I said will believe whoever predes at to life when they hear the word it will Quicken them it is not up to me to do the things it is up to him to demonstrate himself and we preach salvation of the soul and we pray for the sick Brothers we very sad when we asked have believed no one raised up their hand but they that trust in the name of the Lord shall not be ashamed you know what happened afterwards I'll tell you what happen it is very difficult there for people to believe public I learned later because when you believe no one will B you church that bu is there so if you believe something else who will bu you so nobody could come out but when we went back to the city one by one started coming until today there still coming I told the pastor there I said pastoras you will soon realize that you have the whole village and the whole village will realize they all believers before this one is baptized the other one does not know whoever gets baptized they keep quiet they keep quiet they keep quiet but they don't know that more than half of them are all baptized now you know when the word comes into a true pred SE begins eating you up slowly by slowly Slowly by slowly it is a sure word of Prophecy I am what I am because of this message this message can change you can even change your appetite can even change your desire can even change your reasoning I am so happy I brained those let me first finish this quar and then we go to Genesis CH 11 how many are still with me listen why why should we have those things because it is thriving on the natural resources of the vine itself you see it wasn't grafted into the vine it was born in the vine when other branches were grafted in all they could do was Bear their own fruit for they were not born of that vine they don't know about the original life and original Fruit they cannot know for they were not born of it but if they had been born of it that same life that was in the original stem Jesus would have come through them and manifested through them he said I very I unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do he shall do also and great works than these shall he do because I go unto my father denominations which are man directed cannot be born again born of God for it is the spirit not man that gives life praise God there quite much I can say about that let's let's move on because of time Genesis 11 you know the story but let's just read uh one one verse only and Tera took Abraham his son and L the son of Haron his son his son and Sarai his daughter-in-law his son Abraham's wife and they went forth with them from h of the ches to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Haron andw there Genesis 11 now let me invite you to something else here I want you to look at teror and what I will call the denominational Legacy teror having no promise having no Confidant having no Legacy from God whatsoever that he had inherited nothing he stands up I do not know either by instinct or by inspiration started do you know that all the denominations are claiming to be taking the people to Heaven they are trying to enter the promised land without without right and that's what ter was trying to do to his son ABR he was trying to take him to Canan but I want to say this the best Legacy that he could leave for his son was Haram har Haron was a mountaineous place Haron was a m was not a pleasant place you know they set out to go to Canan and for some reason they arrived in har and they could not proceed there is no way the denominational Legacy take people into the right pris land way promis land of the Holy Ghost is only going to be attained by the beneficiaries of this true and sure Legacy praise God in this place Terra dies so this is a place that is unpleased and filled with death and brother B also mentions on that when he he types Church to two places the Mery and to uh to the labor and it says what have they done the denominations they've turned Church into aary where even our young people will lose their enthusiasm will lose their fire we lose their SE and we want to deceive our elders to dece that oh no we are all right no I say you are not all right if you are not on fire for God on fire for something else I am not talking to the young people if you not on fire for God you on fire for the world I've seen it when they come to church they behave as very good church people very good church people the word is being preached and they very good very very good people amen amen and they in the land of n as I had one preacher say they'll just shake their head lift up one finger and you'll never hear a sound out of them and they in chch the last place I the last time I checked the last time I checked that kind of Silent place was in the m in the M you have to be very well behaved they even put a sign please respect the dead don't make a noise don't shout don't throw things down don't stop your feet don't grab your hands if you gra your hand say dead you doing what is it it is a Mery this is what the denominations are I was there I was there in the denominations when they sing and you feel excited the best thing you can do is to just shake your head but you begin saying hallelujah say people will turn say what is wrong what is wrong but let me here we are in the church we are in the labor World Hallelujah why this is where life is quickened if people who are watching football can be quickened the ex I saw an old man an old man when his scored a goal stood up and you tell me we who have a Word of Life we are going to watch a picture as if we watching television no no let us tell let me tell you Church young people we must be on fire for God let us not accept to be lukewarm oh I want five young people here who will say I refuse to be L I refuse to be L I am talking to you young people who say I refuse to be L I will say Amen to I will my hand I will shout amen because IED a legacy praise God and here was taking his son to can oh let somebody tell you have no right to take your son to can let someone tell these dein you have no right to take anybody only the message denominations they try to take us to the land of the Holy Ghost the best Legacy they left to us was death and confusion and questions but wait until God would live for his owny behold I send you the Prophet this message of the hour this will be a sure Legacy to lead us into the land of the Holy Ghost the promise I want I want you to see here the prom in Genesis 12 verse 1 and 4 now the Lord said unto Abram get the out of your country and from your kind and from your father's house andto a land which I will show you and I will make of the a great nation and I will bless thee and make your name great and you shall have a you shall be a blessing and I will bless them that bless you and I will C them that cures you and in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed oh we ought to say Amen to that so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and Lord went with him what did God tell AB will bless you oh my God can we pronounce it to as somebody else here tell some said I bless them I will make your name great you will be a blessing I will bless them that bless you C them that cast in you shall all the families of the be blessed church let us take it out of there let

generation we don't see his father and his father father generation but here is the generation we see how old are you 14 you a child I asked I knew but I asked you because I wanted you to know you don't have a a child but I wanted that you will have a child look at this your generation received a Legacy Legacy is not only money or wealth you it might be a tradition might be culture it might be Spirit it might be demon and they just came right right to you and when you were young like him you f it and F and because you stood and came you told yourself from this generation I am going to procure be a part of another Legacy I am no longer going to be part of the Legacy my unbelieving father I'm going to have another father his name is Jesus Christ and from the day you did that oh you

that Legacy they can never the devil can never have them they are under Covenant ISAC son even the devil could not have him God bless you listen to [Applause] this I know it's almost one and usually time I think should be up for me but do you give me a few more more minutes thank you now listen Abraham looks for a beneficiary for his of his legac Abraham son and yet God gave him a big Legacy and yet he had no son so in Genesis 15:1 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not AB I am your Shield I am your Shield I am not listening to a scripture God is exciting me I'm applying it upon my life I am your Shield I am your exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God what will you give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this areas of Damascus and Abraham said behold to me thou has given no sin and L no one is one is born in my house is mine hair he wanted that it's hair that benefits from the Legacy The Inheritance and behold the word of the Lord came unto me him saying this shall not be your hair but he that shall come forth out of your own for shall be your hair some people get offended something I'm going to say right here some people get offended when they see pastor's son's relative's wife daughter pastor's cousin Pastor son-in-law pastor's Uncle some people get offended when they see those ministering he's ministering because of his father because God sent me to tell you this are you hearing it is right and it isical when God Abraham abramy Abraham promise a covenant and this Covenant needed a hair inherit to be a beneficiary of this Legacy and Abraham say I only have a from another place told him don't worry I'm going to give you a hair out from you a family member from you from your go shall come as and he will be the Ben of your legy not an outsider we all are not Outsiders we oh my God we are in Christ that's our where our inheritance is it's not from outside oh my God we are children not by being by joining this family but by being born here tell someone I'm born here I am born here I'm a born of this family it is not past st's family no it is Jesus Christ's family and I'm a part of it I'm an hair to a mansion this and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be your hair but he shall but but he shall he that shall come out of thine own Bo shall your hair let me check this even further do you know elishah came from Elijah's now don't think don't think he was son and he was supposed to continue the legy everything other people came do you know what done do you know he's going he said shut up I know I know I've seen people talk about I'm sorry my Elder usually they and I feel soad the other time I had to say something on the answer it although you told me to answer those but sometimes I have one man came up and he said oh William oh he was this or he was that that's why he died way he died listen you don't know are you his son you are not you are just around but as far as I am concerned I am in the I am I'm a I am a beneficiary of the bigest of William R his message I am a benici of it and I know nobody needs to tell me anything they are critics because they don't know what they talking about but we know we have received a message we know what it is and Abraham started Ming said don't worry I'm fixing your [Music] legacy the beneficially arrives now Genesis 211 to3 and and the Lord say just interet this the Lord visit Sarah as he said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for sah conceed and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born him be to him Hallelujah is is hereu the benici has arrived we are the benici hallelujah hallelujah praise God now Genesis 223 and Abraham rose up early in the morning well I hope you you can excuse me my taking sometime here I know whenever we have Vis at home we take quite a little longer I now know why because you know you're not going to come back quickly you have to keep it once and go so will you please bear with me chch and Abraham rose up early in the morning and settled his and took two of his younger men with him and Isaac his son and cl the wood and cve the wood for the burn offering and Rose up and went up into the place of which God had told him then on on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young man abide here with us and I and the Lord will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the B offering and laid it upon Isaac's son and and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a bur offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burn offering so they went both of them together and Abraham stretched forth this is verse 10 now and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the Lord neither do do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God see that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from you now I know must know this story so now listen church I've just been reading the story where Abraham had G to kill his son God told him go to where I will tell you and you will kill him there I'm now trying to come to a climax of my sermon praise God this message checks us child trains us trains us to what God wants us to do God is wise he's not going to leave the message with people who are not trained that's why younger ministers like us should not begin preaching unless we know what we talking about I give is not enough you need to be under a Ministry you need to be told you need to know what you're talking about that's why even me as a pastor I'm still mented by Elders why because I'm younger in the ministry you see now we see here this man Abraham begins to child train his son Isaac they went on up to the hill and as they were climbing I always love this part you know there is a place let me bring it down here there is a place where brother bam was walking with everybody all of you come all of you come they were walking with brother Bram you cannot walk after me walk behind me because I'm now training you so they were all around him come come come are not good movie actors brother and they were moving with him but when he reached somewhere brother bam as he's going to go into the thir pool of his ministry the others automatically had to be laid off they couldn't understand anything anymore they it wasn't for them we were not Sons but was meant for the bride now here Abraham is with everybody he tells them now as as you are concerned please now you can go stay with us stay with us stay with us I will go with my son Isa onto the hill to worship God I'll go witha into the deeper things of God only Isaac can understand the Revelation only Isaac who can understand the four living creatures only who can understand the rapture Mar and div why because Isaac is my son is the beneficiary of my legacy the rest of you stay with your Don I will go with ISAC to the hill and when Isaac was with ABR said Papa the fire here is everything where is the offering understand this message that's why Shalom all is way all way we have message shom you not understand but just substance all things are possible only believe only believe accept everything I tell you yeah don't strug follow me I want to declare to you the true bride of Christ only Bel whether you understand or not if you understand that's good you don't understand just believe it but in new God will open the he always does but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begin to said the mystery is now finished he has opened it up for us we now know who we are that's what I was coming ISAC know who he was he had to come to a place of believing God and knowing he cannot die because he the beneficiary ofac there is no way Isaac could die completely the devil could not die let me stop right here and I tell you this you cannot die no one can stop you God is Pur for your life has been accompl why you are the bride we are the unstoppable that's why the scripture says what can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ nothing no pain nothing suffering nothing it cannot if this man die he was going to rise up again because Abram knew told him it is not it is your own son took his son him he had this in his God said my son is the beneficiary of my legacy so if God tells me to kill him let me kill him God will raise some you this morning was going to be the benefici of the and when he was going to kill him don't what's your name brother oh my brother you have a good future ahead of you a good blessing of God ahead of you nothing can kill you always remember that nothing can kill nothing can destroy until God for your life hallelujah hallelujah and right there as rose up again out of that place Isaac left that place after being child train Abraham teaches Isaac and trains him the way of God now I'm reaching the clima here now he trains him to have faith in God Abraham's Ministry is very important to Isaac the B alone is not enough Isaac had to be child trained by Isa Abraham for to walk into the being the beneficiary to come to the of Abraham's great legacy it is important now for Isaac to both recognize and respect Abraham it is through those that have run before us that we become benici to honor them is not a privilege on their part honor them is not a privilege on their part it is a privilege on our part oh because I told you oh now that I have five children and I'm a pastor in Campa I was a pastor in Ethiopia oh Ethiopia has many Believers now so I'm now a big man and now I'm going to tell you you know even now I'm I be a fo to do that many min I'm now bigger than Pastor James my is I just met him recently whenever things come up I go and sit down why no man can replace your are you hearing Sten I kind of fill my heart that our generation needs to Lear this know that God has a great future for us a great work ahead of us on the right to honor the men of God the elders those who went before us is a privilege to us to recognize and respect them is not an option many young preachers come up happy to say this because I'm a younger preacher and all because they can shout and dance bigger preacher now I'm better than now everybody that is PR Isaac needed to come to that place of realizing recognizing and respecting the Elder not an option it is a necessity for us to walk into this place to be beneficiaries ofy that they have passed down to us we must walk to this place I don't know how many young ministers we have here but I know this is being streamed and many will he perhaps and uh be a blessing to them first Timothy 5:17 the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and Doctrine 519 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses again son Elder receive not our generation is very Fierce very Fierce you see pH people Bel have a phone raise up your hand God is seeing you God is seeing you years if you have a ph up you see these phon I'm like I'm these phon right what the pastor did can you imagine you did that or you have ever done that your you need repent reive unless you have two or three Witnesses but then again an elder that rules well bece over but for us I'm talking about theer generation you find them on chat groups WhatsApp groups talking against ministers talking against pastors working against Elders against deons we are to be ashamed of us how can we inherit this Legacy how can we be beneficiaries of it we ridicule men that God has used in our life it doesn't have to be spiritual leaders only even your biological parents we need to respect I'm telling you this because I believe it and I believe there has been a Revival in this country but God wants to send more Revival there may no longer be a Revival of an entire world all together but I tell you what God wants to send a Revival in our chal in the country want to among the Believers of this message the Bible says we shall be heads not ta why do we set up for L why are we not moving because we have not started right we need to come back to the place where Isaac was whatever the father told him he went whatever the father told you he was he was he was teachable he knew his place a wife should know their place a wife should know her place a mother should know her place a child should know her placeand should know place we all should know our place when we all know our place Revival is B to come if you believe it say amen and now I bring it to a close down here gen 61 Genesis 261 and there was a femine in the land beside the first fine that was in the days of Abraham and is went King of the Philistines G and the Lord appeared unto him and said go not down into the Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell the so John in this land and I will be with you and I will bless you for un to you and unto your SE I will give all these countries and I will perform the O which I swear unto Abraham your father someone needs to see that there I will make your I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and I will give unto thy seed all these countries and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed praise God I have two short qu more to read and thank you being a very good audience thank you for being patient with me but I have to bring this to a cross listen to me Isaac comes to a place where the god of Abraham why because now Abraham

jaob son of who son of Isaac son of who son of Abraham son of who son of son of all right now what's your name brother Wilson so now as a preacher to tell us you're Wilson son of who son of Pastor I son of who son of Pastor son of who God bless you you've really done so well God bless you give but I tell you Church the problem with our generation lies right there someone will come and tell you how they doing exploits and they will never tell you where they came from is this going home I believe it has going now let me just read a few here and from Mage 9 but but job knew he wasn't a sinner because he was standing on the word god required that that b offering a confession and job had made his confession and stood on the word and he cried in the midst of his trouble I know my redeemer at the last day he will stand out of his trouble I know my redeemer Liv at the last days he will stand on the Earth and though the skin worm destroy in this body yet in my flesh shall I see his comfort was God his promise God his word and the prophet says that is theit that we have God is what it is the promise God gave Abraham the promise Abraham pass it to Isaac pass to Jacob down to us today in our generation God gave the word to our prophet and our elders received it they were stewards of it they passed it down to this generation let me tell you most of our elders that started out are growing old and old and old but they have done a nor work we started translation in luganda and uh P St you may not know this but some brothers told them said well now that we have our own team of doing Uganda translations we have to remove everything the others did because it was not good and then we start something good freshh I told them I don't see that anywhere in the scripture if we are going to do translation we are starting on top of what others did because what they did was the best they could do and what they did has got us here from there we continue building the work of God is not a war building is a building and we are building this work we are fellow laborers together but we are not going to build a house by destroying the foundation we are building on top of the foundation that has been laid for us thank God for Uganda for the message coming in this country thank God for me like brother Steven thank God for like God for other men that Ed every region in this country what was that it was God laying a foundation for Our Generation what have we received we have received this message we must receive it with a seal with fire we must receive it with vision we must be ready oh I'm bing up with this we must be ready to take it out with the same Zeal the same passion the same fire the same burden the way they have and then watch what I'm telling you what I don't believe the Rapture is very far but if the Rapture is C must find us on fire for God we hear many testimonies of what God used them to do but we want to see that in our generation men and women who were praying how you you you ask Mama where is she she oh right over there just find time and talk with her she she will tell you how they used to pray how they they used to T for God H for God but our generation oh because they're seeing the pastor drives a good carames I want to be rich I want to be rich and I want to be reach in one year and so what will they do they going to go and and get some sort of I want to make because I want to serve God I have and then they will just do this and then they will take all the money and then this is the person going to disturbing around disturbing other houses like bodies in other men Affairs so you come to Pastor you know Pastor I'm a preacher I'm a pastor and and God has sent me in another town I'm asking that you give me some money I go to start something there Pastor doesn't know him he doesn't know how he started he doesn't know who sent you you will tell him I'm sorry I pray with you but I can't give you any financial assistance is very mean unless it is him doing everything can wait a what happened send you we started the fellowship in campala and I can stand here and tell you it was very hard we started in our house my pastor place this when we were moving and we started in our house myself and my family over here just by ourselves and it was hard it still hard but not as three four people fine we increased we left the house we increased we got a bigger house and that's where our pastor visited us and encourage we close 100 people now in two years but with hard labor no man not even our Elder has set us he will support if God sends you he will be behind you the moment you begin bothering other people a clear sign that there is a problem with your these are the very people who can never dress where they came from they believe they came like mushroom who is your pastor you know I came from you know you us who your you know it's not a big deal what matters is I'm a Child of God our head is in heaven come on we need better than that oh I don't know whether there's a young Minister young man here being encouraged today but I'm telling we have come to a place where we me and I'm done but here is what I'm saying this of the word of God of the mage of willum from the inside where will be consumed oh God consume me just use me the way you will I want to serve you and I want to be a witness pray for the men of God that God use respect them and then from there and we we just desire in our hearts to encourage more young people with the same things you've heard here today and that's why we are calling these so parents you can send your young people let them come and just encourage one another and uh we don't know what God but what we know after the Catholic Church why not ug UGA only the enemy of sickness is going to be under they caus commotion in the Bible the Kings asked who are those people who are those people why because they were they could hear what God was doing Among Us let them hear what God is doing among us if you go out on evangelize pre ex bringing people to the knowledge of the truth not by hundreds why not by thousands I know we've seen that here but we want more by tens of thousands if possible yes it's not the numbers but who say the numbers are going to be there one day is this message the truth is this message the truth how many are we here if we are 200 without even the pastor putting any effort if we evangelize each person one person Pastor step is going to expand the church one person one person how many are those how long do you need to evangelize to one person how long one day so in one day one person each person that is 200 one day 200 people time 30 days in one month we shall need a big in two months all G will be shaken what is happening what is happening and soon enough you brother was fighting the past I want also to preach you realize that Pastor will give you another Min another min and all will be under the power of the
