[1:06:39] this was a big
[1:06:42] church which ended up being
[1:06:45] abandoned remains of the aan Baptist
[1:06:48] Temple a vast expans of building that
[1:06:50] was one of the first mega churches in
[1:06:52] the United States
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:07:00] it's in America
[1:07:06] America you the paring AR Bap its modest
[1:07:10] Beginnings in 1935 with just 80
[1:07:15] members it was headed by Dallas F
[1:07:17] Billington a southern evangelist who had
[1:07:20] moved to akan to work at good gear
[1:07:22] Tire in just 6 months the church had
[1:07:25] grown over 500 members and they built
[1:07:28] their first building in
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:31] 1937 they continue to grow necessitating
[1:07:34] speakers placed outside for those who
[1:07:36] could not fit into the pews and by 1948
[1:07:39] membership was at 10,000 and a new 2800
[1:07:42] SE Auditorium was they GRE to
[1:07:45] 10,000 in 1948
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:07:58] the main church is right over but this
[1:08:00] is now how the church looks
[1:08:03] like the building is
[1:08:07] deserted there's
[1:08:22] nobody oh wow yeah there she is the last
[1:08:27] for for getet that
[1:08:34] thing they had radio
[1:08:38] programs they used to record all the
[1:08:40] messages they used to preach in that
[1:08:44] church but look at what it looks like
[1:08:49] now they had they would use these were
[1:08:52] like higher yeah these were higher
[1:08:55] quality than a VCR like you would record
[1:08:57] TV masters and this
[1:08:59] thing this is from
[1:09:03] 93 yeah that is
[1:09:08] 193 aan Baptist Temple would be at the
[1:09:11] Forefront of new Ministries over the
[1:09:13] years even before their first building
[1:09:15] they had been producing radio programs
[1:09:17] which would culminate in owning their
[1:09:19] own record label that put out numerous
[1:09:21] gospel
[1:09:22] records Services would be Broad weekly
[1:09:26] on W akr
[1:09:28] TV here's some more recordings oh yeah
[1:09:31] look at this theyve got all their still
[1:09:35] sa here here's cassettes from they just
[1:09:38] walked out and left everything
[1:09:43] there that's
[1:09:45] dton so this was 20 Soul sermons
[1:09:49] preached here
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:57] yeah but look at all of these this just
[1:10:01] has to
[1:10:03] be yeah from
[1:10:08] 90
[1:10:09] 91 that's how much they
[1:10:13] recorded all those are full of them
[1:10:18] too well actually a lot of been taken
[1:10:22] out in 1938 they would bu pioner the
[1:10:25] concept of bus Ministries when they
[1:10:27] purchased two school buses to pick up
[1:10:29] children for Sunday school there were
[1:10:31] the number would
[1:10:33] expand buses that take up the city on
[1:10:37] take their children
[1:10:40] too by 1969 they were the largest Sunday
[1:10:44] School in the world with almost 6,000
[1:10:47] students in 1959 they had the largest
[1:10:49] Sunday
[1:10:52] School in the world of 6,000
[1:10:58] children look at this they had it jungle
[1:11:01] theme with a palm trees as the um
[1:11:06] support beams
[1:11:43] it's really random they just had
[1:11:49] thater it doesn't really look like AER
[1:11:55] just a tree stop there's too much you
[1:11:58] know they had all kinds of holes in
[1:12:11] their they had
[1:12:13] U Baptist trees they they had
[1:12:22] everything and even very big ground
[1:12:27] to park their
[1:12:29] cars but look at what is happening
[1:12:33] there there's no evidence of life after
[1:12:38] death the 24hour VIS was held for over
[1:12:43] 18 in7 and as the scripture would say
[1:12:46] twice pled up by the roots Temple was
[1:12:49] replaced 4,000 SE building even though
[1:12:53] sometimes attendants would reach 7,000
[1:12:57] just two years after opening the new
[1:12:58] church would catch fire by suspected
[1:13:04] arson it was rebuilt to the current
[1:13:07] 4,000 seat Auditorium which sits on 29
[1:13:10] acres of
[1:13:12] land so you know uh those who would need
[1:13:16] I'll post it on the chat room of the
[1:13:21] church I I think we can stop it there it
[1:13:23] has given you the
[1:13:25] idea of what we want to project this
[1:13:32] morning do you love him this
[1:13:35] morning it was once
[1:13:39] upon a
[1:13:42] time a famous
[1:13:45] Church all over the
[1:13:47] world
[1:13:48] but there's
[1:13:51] nobody and government is just wanting to
[1:13:54] find some
[1:13:57] money to destroy the
[1:14:00] building nobody is concerned about
[1:14:04] it isn't
[1:14:06] that would you think such a thing would
[1:14:11] happen if there's no
[1:14:17] life then that's what you need you can
[1:14:21] have because the Next Generation
[1:14:26] they did not have
[1:14:29] passion the young people did not have
[1:14:32] interest in the
[1:14:34] church and that's where the church
[1:14:38] ended millions of dollars imparted in
[1:14:43] there but they just waited for the first
[1:14:46] men who had the burden to
[1:14:50] die and they all walked out and left it
[1:14:55] just what can I call
[1:15:00] it we just pray that the Lord may be
[1:15:04] gracious amen
[1:15:07] so
[1:15:11] um before we can get into the
[1:15:16] service uh Sister
[1:15:18] Mary
[1:15:21] ofy has taken her mother to sambia
[1:15:24] hospital
[1:15:26] for another
[1:15:28] operation so she's requesting for our
[1:15:34] prayers amen amen and U I want you to
[1:15:38] know that
[1:15:40] brother
[1:15:43] Isaac was taken back to hospital
[1:15:48] again and so we need really to prepare
[1:15:53] for the end
[1:15:57] time I'm now not talking about the end
[1:16:00] time of the
[1:16:03] world but our end of
[1:16:08] time is always not a very simple
[1:16:12] one we just pray that the
[1:16:15] Lord gives us
[1:16:17] Grace amen and I've always
[1:16:22] desired that if the Lord has to take me
[1:16:25] out of this
[1:16:27] body he doesn't need to ask
[1:16:30] me even if he wants to do it
[1:16:34] now I'll be happy that
[1:16:36] way amen so I've got uh also a testimony
[1:16:43] here and a prayer
[1:16:47] request this is our sister Anna

[1:29:14] to go to
[1:29:16] before amen so let's stand up and get to
[1:29:19] our scripture
[1:29:21] reading we shall turn to the book of
[1:29:25] Genesis chapter
[1:29:28] 5 and then go to Genesis chapter
[1:29:32] 2 amen so in Genesis
[1:29:38] 5 and verse one he says this is the book
[1:29:42] of the generations of
[1:29:45] Adam in the day that God created
[1:29:49] man in the likeness of God met he him
[1:29:56] male and
[1:29:58] female created he them and blessed them
[1:30:03] and called their name
[1:30:06] Adam in the day when they were
[1:30:09] created what was the name of
[1:30:12] Eve at the time of
[1:30:15] creation she was
[1:30:18] Adam amen how many of you sisters here
[1:30:24] a new
[1:30:25] name the name of your
[1:30:28] husband those who are not ashamed of
[1:30:30] their
[1:30:32] husband
[1:30:34] their God for that amen this is the book
[1:30:39] of the generations of
[1:30:41] Adam in the day that God created
[1:30:48] man my my my he created him in the
[1:30:52] likeness of God
[1:30:55] and this man here was male and
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] female and they had their name
[1:31:04] Adam and then when we go to Genesis
[1:31:07] chapter
[1:31:09] 2 and verse
[1:31:12] 24
[1:31:13] therefore this is now at the
[1:31:18] separation the female from the male
[1:31:24] and therefore the scripture says
[1:31:27] therefore shall a
[1:31:32] man leave his father and
[1:31:35] mother and shall cl to his
[1:31:38] wife and there shall be one body
[1:31:44] again now I want you to see that Genesis
[1:31:48] chapter
[1:31:49] 1 God created the
[1:31:52] man amen
[1:31:54] are you together with me he created
[1:32:00] man he created a
[1:32:03] man but now here a man shall leave his
[1:32:07] father and
[1:32:11] mother so my subject
[1:32:14] today is
[1:32:16] man and a man no man and a
[1:32:22] man man
[1:32:24] and a
[1:32:26] man now man here was male and female
[1:32:32] together but when God separated the
[1:32:37] female he's now referring to
[1:32:41] Adam as a
[1:32:43] man shall leave his father and
[1:32:46] mother so we want speak about
[1:32:50] man and a
[1:32:52] man may the Lord add blessing the
[1:32:54] reading of his
[1:32:55] word you may be seated so we want to
[1:33:00] start the subject
[1:33:03] today by establishing some fine
[1:33:11] details between
[1:33:13] man and a
[1:33:15] man now brother has done this
[1:33:19] before he does some fine details
[1:33:25] so that we can be able to properly
[1:33:28] understand some of these
[1:33:31] things he made a fine
[1:33:35] definition between
[1:33:38] Jesus and
[1:33:40] Christ Jesus being the
[1:33:43] body of
[1:33:45] sacrifice where Christ the holy spirit
[1:33:49] dwelt in now he also told us about the
[1:33:53] three offices of the one
[1:33:56] God you know he had three
[1:33:59] offices and yet one God so he says one
[1:34:03] of the
[1:34:04] offices his father another office his
[1:34:09] son and another office is only God so he
[1:34:13] tells us these are not three people but
[1:34:17] one man moving in three different
[1:34:20] offices and then he comes also and gives
[1:34:24] us the three sons
[1:34:27] offices and then he says when he came in
[1:34:30] the body of
[1:34:31] Flesh he was son of
[1:34:34] man amen and then through the seven
[1:34:38] churches he Son of God when he comes in
[1:34:42] the M he will be son of David so all
[1:34:46] these fine
[1:34:48] details every one of them had some kind
[1:34:52] of clarity to gave to the
[1:34:57] body so these fine details make
[1:34:59] important
[1:35:04] distinctions to give a a statement a
[1:35:08] better
[1:35:11] clarity now Genesis
[1:35:14] 5 gives us the meaning of
[1:35:19] man okay so God created man
[1:35:24] in the likeness of
[1:35:27] God male and female created he there he
[1:35:32] talking about
[1:35:33] man and then he says blessed them and
[1:35:37] called their name Adam in the day when
[1:35:40] they were
[1:35:41] created so now
[1:35:44] listen some of these statements
[1:35:47] now Man was created but kan's seed
[1:35:53] was a product of car
[1:35:58] Union are you together with me man was
[1:36:03] created the Bible says God created
[1:36:07] man but then
[1:36:09] see was never created it's a product of
[1:36:15] Union amen so man had a Celestial
[1:36:21] representation amen he was a spirit
[1:36:24] body that was dressed into the
[1:36:28] flesh that was a
[1:36:30] creation and then for
[1:36:33] me amen but for he is not represented in
[1:36:39] eternity he just comes as a product of a
[1:36:45] union of a man I mean a male and a
[1:36:49] female now listen
[1:36:53] was a serpent
[1:36:56] sea that did not have eternal
[1:36:59] life a wild
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:04] sea that was planted in a good
[1:37:07] ground You Know The Enemy Satan he just
[1:37:11] knew the
[1:37:13] principles that as long as the seed goes
[1:37:16] into the
[1:37:17] ground it will
[1:37:20] germinate and that's what he did he went
[1:37:23] and got the
[1:37:25] farm which we know as
[1:37:28] e and planted his seed there and the
[1:37:32] seed came to
[1:37:35] life but have eternal
[1:37:38] life
[1:37:41] so can do all
[1:37:46] things can
[1:37:49] do are you together with me they can
[1:37:52] function
[1:37:55] everything they can learn the language
[1:37:57] of
[1:37:58] men they can reproduce in
[1:38:02] men are you together with me but I want
[1:38:05] tell you that se is not an eternal
[1:38:09] SE it can do anything
[1:38:13] religious it can
[1:38:15] sacrifice it can even come to church
[1:38:18] service but it cannot retain itself in
[1:38:21] the world
[1:38:26] okay now here the definition of
[1:38:29] man is the elected human
[1:38:35] R hallelujah hallelujah th now
[1:38:40] man man is the elected human
[1:38:45] race man was
[1:38:48] defined as the
[1:38:50] likeness and the image of God
[1:38:54] which Kan was
[1:38:57] not does that bother you I start
[1:39:02] bringing it more deeper into the
[1:39:06] word because when
[1:39:09] man was being
[1:39:11] defined the scripture says God created
[1:39:16] man and then defined man as the image
[1:39:21] and likeness of God
[1:39:24] but Cain was not the image and likeness
[1:39:28] of God and he was not a creation of
[1:39:32] God he was just a
[1:39:34] product of a
[1:39:37] union so man came into the original
[1:39:42] existence as
[1:39:45] a a spirit
[1:39:48] be and he maintained the general
[1:39:51] description of man
[1:39:54] when he was made a body of
[1:39:58] Flesh he was still
[1:40:01] man he still had the image of
[1:40:05] God he was still flesh and I mean he was
[1:40:08] still male and
[1:40:10] female but in Genesis
[1:40:13] 2 when the female was EXT
[1:40:18] extracted from the rib of
[1:40:21] Adam we find a distinction
[1:40:24] when now is refer to as a
[1:40:30] man totally distinct from the
[1:40:34] female are you together with me now now
[1:40:38] man and a
[1:40:44] man somebody say
[1:40:46] Amen yes sir let's go to Genesis chapter
[1:40:51] 2 and verse 21
[1:40:54] when I was out there
[1:40:57] preaching I told the people that when
[1:41:00] you say men I
[1:41:09] Health amen amen Genesis
[1:41:13] 2:21 listen and the Lord God caus the
[1:41:18] Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam
[1:41:25] and he
[1:41:27] slept and took one of his
[1:41:31] ribs and closed up the Flesh in
[1:41:36] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:41:39] had taken from
[1:41:43] Man
[1:41:45] Woman and brought the
[1:41:50] man so the female
[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:41:54] was
[1:41:57] extracted and Adam said this is now B of
[1:42:02] my
[1:42:03] B and Flesh of My
[1:42:06] Flesh she shall be called
[1:42:11] woman because she was taken out of the
[1:42:16] man now we've got a
[1:42:19] man and also a woman
[1:42:23] and so verse
[1:42:25] 24 is where we
[1:42:27] read
[1:42:29] therefore shall a
[1:42:32] man leave his father and his
[1:42:36] mother and shall CLE unto his
[1:42:40] wife and the mathematics will be
[1:42:46] defied because they
[1:42:49] two shall still be one
[1:42:54] are you together with me okay so when we
[1:42:58] talk about
[1:43:02] man amen we are referring to the
[1:43:07] elected human
[1:43:11] race much as science uses the word
[1:43:17] man to mean the human
[1:43:22] r including the serpent
[1:43:26] se but when God uses the word
[1:43:30] man is referring to you and
[1:43:33] me who have got their
[1:43:36] representation created in the image and
[1:43:38] likess of
[1:43:42] God are you together with me the
[1:43:44] interpretation of
[1:43:46] Eve does not come through here because
[1:43:50] when she go birth to
[1:43:53] uh this man
[1:43:55] came she said I gotten a man from the
[1:44:02] Lord and brother Bram says of course
[1:44:06] it's God who gives
[1:44:09] life so he gave her
[1:44:12] life I mean gave Kan life to live by in
[1:44:17] the line of
[1:44:19] humanity but he didn't have a
[1:44:21] representation in heav
[1:44:27] so man as a reference to the creation
[1:44:31] that
[1:44:38] God you know he had the
[1:44:42] image and likeness of God that is
[1:44:46] man as defined in Genesis
[1:44:50] 5 verse 1 and two
[1:44:55] he was created two he had the likeness
[1:44:59] and the image of
[1:45:00] God did have the image and likeness of
[1:45:05] God is just a result of human you know
[1:45:10] uh uh human uh
[1:45:15] reproduction he you know He Man was
[1:45:19] created in a specific image
[1:45:23] which is the image of
[1:45:26] God and the image of God is the
[1:45:31] spirit John
[1:45:34] 4:24 God is a
[1:45:38] spirit amen and this man who has made in
[1:45:42] the image of
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:45:45] God he also both the likeness of
[1:45:50] God Amen and like
[1:45:53] of God is something to do with the
[1:45:59] disposition amen disposition is
[1:46:03] character so he was a spirit
[1:46:07] image and he also had the character of
[1:46:11] God that's the
[1:46:13] likeness there was something in
[1:46:16] man that would cause him to act like a
[1:46:21] God and that's the
[1:46:24] likeness so let us look at brother Bram
[1:46:28] here connecting
[1:46:32] likeness and
[1:46:35] character in message Mother's
[1:46:38] Day Mother's
[1:46:40] Day
[1:46:43] amen he says then I think of when we see
[1:46:47] them standing y
[1:46:53] our loved
[1:46:54] ones our
[1:46:56] mothers our
[1:46:59] kindreds all our
[1:47:02] friends to see them in the immortal
[1:47:07] bodies they are celestial
[1:47:10] bodies amen watching their
[1:47:16] character seeing how they conduct
[1:47:21] themselves with that sweet
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:25] quietness no more
[1:47:28] nervousness or
[1:47:31] frustrations to see them
[1:47:34] standing in the likeness of the Lord
[1:47:38] Jesus that will be a wonderful
[1:47:42] day Hallelujah hallu he's talking about
[1:47:46] mothers who have prayed for their
[1:47:49] children to make it to Glory
[1:47:53] and brother Bram says when we see them
[1:47:55] standing out
[1:47:56] there that should challenge every
[1:48:00] mother who is out here in the service to
[1:48:04] start praying for your
[1:48:05] children it doesn't matter how crooked
[1:48:09] they are keep claiming them for the
[1:48:13] Lord hallelujah and one day amen when
[1:48:18] the children who
[1:48:20] overcome will stand out there and see
[1:48:23] their mothers
[1:48:25] come they receive the kind of
[1:48:28] character that they passed over to
[1:48:32] them oh Hallelujah hallelu watching
[1:48:36] their
[1:48:37] character in their celestial
[1:48:40] bodies praise God are you together with
[1:48:44] me this likeness has something to do
[1:48:47] with the
[1:48:49] character but the image is
[1:48:54] self-explanatory the spirit
[1:48:57] being let me say now the Ser
[1:49:02] SE was not created in the image of
[1:49:08] God I'm trying to put a value on
[1:49:13] you which you sometimes do not
[1:49:18] realize that you may look at a man
[1:49:22] his flesh and blood like
[1:49:25] you he has got more money than you
[1:49:28] have he has got a great name in the
[1:49:32] nation but you are greater before God
[1:49:35] because you are a
[1:49:37] creation but it's just a kind of
[1:49:40] [Applause]
[1:49:41] formation a biological
[1:49:45] product are you together with me that's
[1:49:49] who you are amen you are what more than
[1:49:53] 100
[1:49:56] W oh praise God if we can realize who we
[1:50:01] are amen so I I want to take you back
[1:50:06] into Genesis chapter 1
[1:50:09] here Genesis
[1:50:12] 1 verse
[1:50:14] 27 we see that God created
[1:50:18] Man In His
[1:50:20] Image amen
[1:50:23] and his
[1:50:24] likess Genesis
[1:50:27] 1:27 so God created man in his own
[1:50:33] image so in the image of God created he
[1:50:38] him male and female created he them
[1:50:42] that's
[1:50:45] man he came through under the image of
[1:50:49] God so now we've been given the image
[1:50:54] but now the
[1:50:57] blessing was the
[1:51:02] likeness are you together with me yes
[1:51:05] sir the image was a spirit
[1:51:09] being but the
[1:51:12] blessing amen was the life behind that
[1:51:18] image so God blessed
[1:51:21] them and he said to them be
[1:51:25] fruitful and
[1:51:27] multiply and replace
[1:51:29] the and subdue it and have
[1:51:33] dominion over the fish of the
[1:51:36] sea over the fall of the
[1:51:39] air everything that move upon
[1:51:43] the so when he created man he made sure
[1:51:49] that he imparted him with a likeness
[1:51:53] which is the character and this
[1:51:55] character here was a
[1:51:58] blessing Hallelujah he blessed them with
[1:52:03] what Peter call the divine
[1:52:09] nature amen so this man here he has the
[1:52:13] character to be
[1:52:16] fruitful this is the divine
[1:52:20] nature which is the spirit spiritual
[1:52:24] blessings this here not any other man
[1:52:28] can have this
[1:52:30] character
[1:52:36] man are you together with me you cannot
[1:52:39] go into a certain big
[1:52:42] convention so that this can be imparted
[1:52:45] upon
[1:52:46] you these days they talk about
[1:52:48] impartation impartation
[1:52:53] you cannot impart this because this is a
[1:52:59] nature you see Man was created to be
[1:53:05] fruitful now fruitful in such a
[1:53:09] way but he Bears the fruit of the
[1:53:13] spirit and because he prospers in the
[1:53:17] spirit even what he touches
[1:53:20] naturally he doesn't
[1:53:23] labor the Lord will just
[1:53:26] multiply just being
[1:53:28] fruitful that's how to
[1:53:31] multiply they
[1:53:32] replenish and they bring
[1:53:35] everything which stands before them to
[1:53:39] challenge them they bring it under the
[1:53:43] fruit of the church that's to
[1:53:47] sub and then have Domin
[1:53:53] Hallelujah when Paul is teaching
[1:53:56] adoption he pointing man back to that
[1:54:01] nature the nature where man fell
[1:54:07] from I told here one
[1:54:09] time that when God created
[1:54:13] man he gave him the
[1:54:15] authority to
[1:54:20] subdue and all the animals
[1:54:23] subjected themselves to
[1:54:26] him but when the fall came that nature
[1:54:30] continued a little
[1:54:33] bit but after the floods of
[1:54:37] Noah another Covenant
[1:54:40] comes and he says that the animals will
[1:54:44] be afraid of
[1:54:49] you that's why you see a man who is not
[1:54:53] born again who does not have a birth
[1:54:56] back into that
[1:55:00] nature when he marries a wife she will
[1:55:03] be afraid of
[1:55:06] him but if he back in that
[1:55:10] nature when he marries a wife she
[1:55:13] subject to
[1:55:17] him those are spiritual
[1:55:21] principles so Paul when he teaches
[1:55:25] adoption is actually talking about
[1:55:28] restoring us
[1:55:30] back into the nature and character where
[1:55:33] we F
[1:55:35] from Ephesians
[1:55:37] 1 verse
[1:55:39] three he says blessed be the
[1:55:43] God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:55:48] Christ who has blessed us
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:54] not will bless
[1:55:57] us but has blessed
[1:56:00] us with all spiritual
[1:56:04] blessings in Heavenly
[1:56:07] places in Christ
[1:56:09] Jesus when did he bless you he blessed
[1:56:14] you in Christ Jesus mean
[1:56:18] chist before he became
[1:56:21] Jesus so this blessing here is part of
[1:56:25] your genetic
[1:56:30] nature it's not anything that is forming
[1:56:35] now he already bless you with all
[1:56:39] spiritual
[1:56:42] blessing that's who you
[1:56:44] are believest thou
[1:56:47] this amen then you step into your
[1:56:50] promise amen because that's who you are
[1:56:54] so the Genesis
[1:56:56] blessings and those spiritual
[1:56:59] blessings in Heavenly
[1:57:02] places when you still an
[1:57:06] attribute amen you are not even come
[1:57:09] down into your body
[1:57:12] nature so these blessings are Divine
[1:57:18] potentials they cannot be achieved by a
[1:57:21] car man
[1:57:24] because this blessings here is
[1:57:28] favor before
[1:57:31] God sometimes we reduce the blessings of
[1:57:36] God to
[1:57:38] financial
[1:57:41] abilities and then you said that's a
[1:57:43] blessed
[1:57:45] man but those are not spiritual
[1:57:48] blessings spiritual blessings they are
[1:57:51] for
[1:57:53] Above This caral
[1:57:55] possessions and the Lord Jesus told us
[1:57:59] the life of a man does not consist of
[1:58:03] the amount of worldly Goods he
[1:58:09] has these blessings cannot be prayed
[1:58:12] into a man's
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:17] life because they are in
[1:58:19] nature which comes on the Sur
[1:58:23] when is De
[1:58:26] with it is inside
[1:58:29] there like the seeds were in the
[1:58:33] earth just waiting for the light to
[1:58:37] strike and the waters to
[1:58:40] clear then the seeds that were in the
[1:58:43] ground would come
[1:58:45] forth so now you are
[1:58:48] here because you have heard the word
[1:58:52] you are a you know uh you are a
[1:58:58] deep which God
[1:59:01] called go the
[1:59:03] deep and your genetic see the
[1:59:07] deep but it was in the M of
[1:59:11] sin but God had the ability to
[1:59:15] call and you have the ability to
[1:59:19] hear so when you hear be like that
[1:59:24] Lily that will grow out of the
[1:59:27] m and fights
[1:59:30] itself until it comes to the
[1:59:33] top to display the
[1:59:35] beauty where did the beauty come from it
[1:59:39] was already in the
[1:59:42] seed and that's who you
[1:59:45] are amen am according as he has chosen
[1:59:49] Us in
[1:59:51] him before the foundation of the
[1:59:54] world so what did he choose you to
[1:59:58] be that you should be holy and Without
[2:00:02] Blame before him in
[2:00:05] love having predestinated
[2:00:08] D the adoption of
[2:00:11] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[2:00:15] according to the good pleasure of his
[2:00:19] will having ordained
[2:00:23] that we should be restored
[2:00:26] back into the
[2:00:28] nature and
[2:00:31] character that is
[2:00:33] adoption it's a spiritual
[2:00:37] character that will be finally
[2:00:42] CT by the adoption to with the change of
[2:00:46] your
[2:00:49] body that will be the C
[2:00:54] of that image and likeness there will
[2:00:58] come a body
[2:01:00] change do you love him you are growing
[2:01:03] towards
[2:01:06] that and sometimes God is so
[2:01:09] gracious that he gives you marvelous
[2:01:13] Revelations of what you are supposed to
[2:01:17] be here and there your hearts flush
[2:01:22] one of these days I'll be
[2:01:24] gone have you ever come to that yeah he
[2:01:28] keeps telling you yes you are going to
[2:01:31] get out of
[2:01:33] here sometimes you have had your
[2:01:37] dreams when you are getting out of here
[2:01:40] some of you have even flown up in the
[2:01:44] air in your dreams have you had those
[2:01:47] dreams
[2:01:48] before you see that you are going away
[2:01:52] and then when you come back into this
[2:01:54] one here the devil starts telling
[2:01:57] you where are you going but God tells
[2:02:01] you I'm working on you I'm cleaning you
[2:02:06] I'm perfecting you by the teaching of
[2:02:09] the
[2:02:10] word the word and let the word begin to
[2:02:14] come forth like the L of the valley and
[2:02:19] not long from now can to
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:26] display that's why Paul I mean John
[2:02:29] says
[2:02:31] beloved now are we the sons of
[2:02:35] God not we will be now are we the sons
[2:02:40] of God and does not yet
[2:02:43] appear what we shall be but we know that
[2:02:48] when he shall appear we shall be like
[2:02:51] him we shall see
[2:02:53] as it not be a feeling of a
[2:02:57] presence rather shall put on his own
[2:03:01] body we come from God we go back to
[2:03:07] God so the I mean the serpent
[2:03:10] SE is not part of the description of
[2:03:16] man as described in Genesis 5
[2:03:21] that's why the prophet says a man
[2:03:24] without the Holy
[2:03:26] Ghost is like a
[2:03:28] beast because that's where it comes
[2:03:31] from but the seed of God is ordained to
[2:03:35] receive the Holy
[2:03:38] Ghost it's a different
[2:03:43] nature
[2:03:44] see does not have the image and likeness
[2:03:47] of
[2:03:49] God the image of
[2:03:52] God is a
[2:03:56] Divine is a
[2:03:59] Divine amen the image it cannot produce
[2:04:04] that
[2:04:06] image it cannot because it doesn't have
[2:04:09] that
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:12] representation and it cannot produce the
[2:04:16] character those two things and now when
[2:04:20] we got first John
[2:04:23] chter 3 ver
[2:04:24] 10 he
[2:04:26] says in this the children of God
[2:04:32] manifest in this in
[2:04:37] what and the children of the
[2:04:40] devil whosoever does not righteousness
[2:04:44] is not of
[2:04:46] God neither he that loveth not his
[2:04:51] brother
[2:04:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah a child of God
[2:04:58] cannot struggle in his
[2:05:01] mind about his brother he may be a
[2:05:05] little
[2:05:06] heart and by Nature he can
[2:05:09] cry the deep and the
[2:05:12] Deep the soul cannot get I mean cannot
[2:05:18] hate amen that's why the scripture says
[2:05:22] you don't allow your anger to go over
[2:05:26] the
[2:05:27] sun about your
[2:05:30] brother the nature will get a little bit
[2:05:34] shocked but as that gets assimilated on
[2:05:37] this
[2:05:39] side it fails to get into the
[2:05:42] soul and then you start saying but is my
[2:05:45] brother
[2:05:48] after and then you say God bless you
[2:05:52] how are you
[2:05:53] today and if that man is spiritual he'll
[2:05:57] be very happy with
[2:06:00] you
[2:06:02] amen
[2:06:04] righteousness you know he says whosoever
[2:06:08] does not righteousness is not of
[2:06:13] God and that does not love his brother
[2:06:17] is not of
[2:06:19] God so righteous
[2:06:22] is obedience to the
[2:06:26] word and exercising Divine love one for
[2:06:32] another is the character of
[2:06:35] God Amen and the
[2:06:38] sonship is marked by those two
[2:06:42] things the first thing you
[2:06:44] said I subject to the
[2:06:48] word the second thing do I love my
[2:06:55] brother those two
[2:06:57] things do I subject to the word they say
[2:07:01] I was talking about social
[2:07:03] media and then you know when you know
[2:07:07] people receive their
[2:07:10] messages they read and
[2:07:13] laugh and then they say you have made my
[2:07:18] day but when the pastor s
[2:07:22] Theon in the
[2:07:24] morning the pastor may not know that I
[2:07:27] have
[2:07:28] read let me say
[2:07:33] Amen you see we should fall in love with
[2:07:37] the
[2:07:38] word that
[2:07:42] righteousness and that's the only way
[2:07:45] you can come out of the mud and begin
[2:07:49] Fring out
[2:07:52] as a child of
[2:07:53] God praise God do you love those
[2:07:58] admonitions yeah they create and they
[2:08:01] mold our
[2:08:04] meditations amen so he says in verse
[2:08:09] 11 this is the message we had from the
[2:08:13] beginning that we should love one
[2:08:18] another
[2:08:21] we
[2:08:22] should not we
[2:08:27] could but we should love one
[2:08:30] another by this will the world
[2:08:34] know that you are my
[2:08:37] disciples when you have love one for
[2:08:41] another when it comes to verse 12 he
[2:08:45] says in those two characters
[2:08:49] [Applause]
[2:08:51] Kan is not able to produce
[2:08:54] it not as
[2:08:56] Kan who was of that Wicked one and slew
[2:09:01] his
[2:09:01] brother simple he could not love his
[2:09:07] brother it didn't come from
[2:09:10] [Applause]
[2:09:11] God and where why did he slay
[2:09:15] him because his Works were
[2:09:19] evil and his brothers
[2:09:22] [Applause]
[2:09:24] could not return
[2:09:28] obedience amen and neither the character
[2:09:31] of the word could work in
[2:09:34] him because this character of the
[2:09:38] word those Divine
[2:09:41] blessings in
[2:09:43] Genesis you can't pray
[2:09:49] them that's
[2:09:52] is a character it's a
[2:09:55] likeness which was only given to
[2:10:01] man praise the Lord that's the trait of
[2:10:06] Lucifer who rebelled from divine
[2:10:10] order and he tried to plant the same
[2:10:13] trait in
[2:10:15] man in the garden
[2:10:18] ofen amen when Adam
[2:10:22] and subject their human
[2:10:25] Spirit to see the trait was to keep away
[2:10:31] from the
[2:10:34] word and from the
[2:10:37] presence started eating on ad and
[2:10:43] Eve are you together with me amen they
[2:10:48] cannot be
[2:10:49] righteous the word
[2:10:52] neither can they
[2:10:53] laugh so now what this
[2:10:56] happened he so his
[2:10:59] object he sold his
[2:11:02] se he sold his
[2:11:04] practice he sold them his
[2:11:07] C he open up
[2:11:10] that
[2:11:13] and they almost sing to
[2:11:16] [Applause]
[2:11:19] their we thank God
[2:11:22] for the Aton in
[2:11:26] the amen listen now Genesis
[2:11:32] 3:8 and they Adam and
[2:11:37] Eve heard the voice of the Lord
[2:11:41] God walking in the of the
[2:11:44] day Adam and his wife he themselves from
[2:11:50] the presence of the Lord
[2:11:52] among the Trees of the
[2:11:54] garden Hallelujah huj there was a tree
[2:11:59] and then the
[2:12:00] trees my God we have got a church and
[2:12:04] then the
[2:12:05] churches they tried to hide among the
[2:12:09] trees they say I also be a part of that
[2:12:12] church but God says I have got my
[2:12:16] Tabernacle
[2:12:19] here where are you why are you hiding in
[2:12:22] the tree come under the tree
[2:12:28] of and the Lord God called
[2:12:32] Adam and said unto him where thou and he
[2:12:37] said I heard thy
[2:12:40] voice in the garden and I was afraid
[2:12:45] because I was naked and I hid myself
[2:12:51] and you remember when you were dealing
[2:12:52] with
[2:12:54] nakedness is the absence of that
[2:12:57] Glory man sined and came short of the
[2:13:01] glory of God theia is naked because it's
[2:13:06] void of that
[2:13:07] Glory you see what I'm talking about so
[2:13:11] now Adam is saying how can I come before
[2:13:14] the world in this kind of condition
[2:13:17] which I am I am void of your glory
[2:13:22] I have
[2:13:23] seen that
[2:13:25] trait had access to the human
[2:13:30] Spirit of Adam and Eve but we thank God
[2:13:35] for the blood atonment in the
[2:13:38] garden because the
[2:13:41] blood went
[2:13:43] straight to guard the issues of
[2:13:47] life which is the soul are you together
[2:13:50] with me
[2:13:51] that's where the blood went to guard the
[2:13:56] soul so that the soul that
[2:13:59] sin shall die that did not go to the
[2:14:02] soul of
[2:14:05] Adam it was in the spirit
[2:14:09] area and God gave the blood to stand
[2:14:14] between the
[2:14:15] soul and the
[2:14:17] spirit my God so the tra
[2:14:22] was
[2:14:24] eliminated from entering into the
[2:14:27] soul and under the law of Moses the
[2:14:31] atonement was repeated every
[2:14:34] year to keep God of the human
[2:14:38] soul because the blood makes atonement
[2:14:42] for the
[2:14:43] soul are you under the
[2:14:45] blood I know it was the
[2:14:49] blood I know it was the blood hallelujah
[2:14:53] hallelujah I know it was the
[2:14:56] blood hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[2:15:00] for the life of the
[2:15:02] flesh is in the blood lus
[2:15:07] 17 the life of the blood is in the
[2:15:12] blood and I have given it unto you upon
[2:15:16] the
[2:15:17] altar what have I given you the life
[2:15:21] of the blood has been given to you on
[2:15:25] the Altar for the
[2:15:27] atonement for your
[2:15:29] soul my God my God you love him amen the
[2:15:37] blood that make atonement for the
[2:15:43] soul praise God Amen God came down
[2:15:49] straight and he came down with an
[2:15:53] atonement because Adam
[2:15:56] confessed that I have
[2:15:58] sinned I am hidden away I'm among all
[2:16:02] these kind of trees
[2:16:05] here some of the people we had here they
[2:16:08] take refuge in the
[2:16:10] trees at least I go to this kind of
[2:16:13] church this kind of church he says no
[2:16:16] come under the tree of
[2:16:18] life he says no no no no I cannot come I
[2:16:23] don't have the glory amen so they cannot
[2:16:27] do two things righteousness and
[2:16:32] love that's how the world is that's
[2:16:36] first John 313
[2:16:38] says Mar not my
[2:16:41] brethren if the
[2:16:44] world
[2:16:47] you Mar not when your neighbor
[2:16:52] hurt you Mar not when your
[2:16:56] workes hurt
[2:16:59] you they cannot return a nature which
[2:17:02] they don't
[2:17:03] have love is of
[2:17:09] God okay
[2:17:12] Brotherhood has a bond of
[2:17:16] Charity which works automatically
[2:17:19] through us as a nature
[2:17:23] because were created in the image and
[2:17:26] likeness can I tell you something
[2:17:28] here that's why brother Bram says
[2:17:33] elect cannot protitute
[2:17:36] [Applause]
[2:17:39] elect
[2:17:40] no elect cannot fight against
[2:17:45] elect so today I am going to talk about
[2:17:49] the Bible description of a
[2:17:53] [Applause]
[2:17:56] man whom the scripture for
[2:18:01] days that he will leave father and
[2:18:05] mother to be joined with his wies and
[2:18:09] there will be one
[2:18:12] body where are the men here
[2:18:16] today
[2:18:18] man and a man
[2:18:24] so where is
[2:18:28] man because man was both male and
[2:18:33] female where is man
[2:18:36] now let man stand up you stand
[2:18:42] up come on now that's good that is man
[2:18:47] it was male and female
[2:18:51] okay so let a man stand
[2:18:56] up where is a
[2:19:00] man good I can see some
[2:19:03] there where is the
[2:19:05] man man stand with the pride of being a
[2:19:11] man thank you God bless
[2:19:14] you God Made You distinct from the woman
[2:19:21] the
[2:19:22] masine and feminine Spirits are not the
[2:19:27] same if you find a man blushing around
[2:19:31] like he was a
[2:19:36] woman there is a
[2:19:38] problem body structures are not the
[2:19:43] same the rules in our lives are not the
[2:19:47] same the man is a b spirit
[2:19:52] while a woman is a tender female
[2:19:56] [Applause]
[2:19:58] spirit and by even
[2:20:00] scripture Our dressing cannot be the
[2:20:04] same so when God made a
[2:20:07] man he made sure that he really place a
[2:20:13] difference both in
[2:20:16] design and character as opposed to the
[2:20:19] woman
[2:20:23] amen so let us just look at the
[2:20:26] separation
[2:20:28] here in the
[2:20:30] separation God allowed the
[2:20:34] male to display the character of
[2:20:39] God and the female to display the
[2:20:42] character of
[2:20:44] the to be a weaker
[2:20:47] V are you together with me God allowed
[2:20:51] this to bring to
[2:20:54] surface the man's Redemptive
[2:20:59] [Applause]
[2:21:00] nature you together with me did it a
[2:21:05] woman can never be the
[2:21:08] same with Inner Strength like a
[2:21:12] man he
[2:21:14] made a weaker vessel he made Sarah a
[2:21:19] weaker vessel
[2:21:21] he made the bride the weaker so that you
[2:21:25] can always be
[2:21:29] forgiven are you together with me that's
[2:21:34] God you see we really need to give
[2:21:37] thanks to
[2:21:39] Abraham the father of
[2:21:42] Faith look at this female
[2:21:47] Revelation that maybe that's the one
[2:21:51] whom God told you to get the child back
[2:21:56] so take this my Bond woman here and got
[2:22:00] a child out
[2:22:04] of sounds like it was in the garden is
[2:22:10] it and Abram did exactly the
[2:22:15] same and the child was born and then the
[2:22:18] next thing God says no this is the one
[2:22:23] going to come by
[2:22:25] Sarah the greatest
[2:22:28] fighter against that
[2:22:31] seed which was
[2:22:33] isma
[2:22:35] was was
[2:22:37] Sarah the child of the born
[2:22:42] woman cannot
[2:22:44] beave with my
[2:22:49] child now
[2:22:52] Abraham says no I canot
[2:22:56] put and God stands with
[2:23:00] Abraham let me tell you Abraham crying s
[2:23:05] the
[2:23:08] woman are together with me he wouldn't
[2:23:11] have liked to do that he would have
[2:23:16] reason Sarah you not play with my mind
[2:23:22] who told me to go with
[2:23:25] her now what wrong have I done SAR you
[2:23:28] not play with
[2:23:32] me but God makes a weak
[2:23:37] Vel so that you may play the part of a
[2:23:47] redeemer you are not saying amen
[2:23:50] me to preach that you are the weaker
[2:23:52] vessel and cry in the
[2:23:56] house no it's not you to cry she's the
[2:24:00] one to
[2:24:01] cry sometimes you go to the
[2:24:04] depth and you really
[2:24:09] seual but you have to be a
[2:24:13] redeem together with me you see he makes
[2:24:18] we
[2:24:20] God did that to just dig
[2:24:24] up your Redemptive
[2:24:26] attributes because you are the image of
[2:24:29] Christ in the
[2:24:31] house the husband must always play the
[2:24:34] part of a
[2:24:37] redeemer and this is what the parents
[2:24:39] should be
[2:24:40] able to I mean to
[2:24:43] cultivate in the male
[2:24:47] children make them men
[2:24:50] tell them that their B
[2:24:53] spirit is not intended to bully their
[2:24:56] young
[2:24:57] sisters but rather to protect
[2:25:02] them teach them you see the church that
[2:25:06] we're looking at
[2:25:08] here they lacked
[2:25:10] males to pass on the
[2:25:14] seed and the men who had the
[2:25:17] Revelation when they died the young
[2:25:19] people did have anything to do with the
[2:25:25] church did you hear that amen so your B
[2:25:32] spirit is not intended to bully
[2:25:36] her is intended to protect
[2:25:41] her to n
[2:25:43] her to redeem
[2:25:46] her brother Bram says he made the B
[2:25:50] spirit for the
[2:25:53] man he made the tender little delicate
[2:25:57] feminist spirit for the
[2:26:02] woman so your B
[2:26:05] spirit is supposed to be the
[2:26:14] defense you are the
[2:26:16] redemer you have to
[2:26:18] R you have to stand for her you have to
[2:26:22] stand between
[2:26:24] judgments that's what God gave you B
[2:26:27] spirit
[2:26:30] for
[2:26:32] man and a
[2:26:34] man praise the Lord so a true
[2:26:39] male is the Redeemer man is not
[2:26:46] judged by how big he is
[2:26:50] and how strong his muscles
[2:26:53] are man is judged by the
[2:26:57] character and character
[2:27:00] Lord that's why when God created
[2:27:03] Adam he doesn't tell us whether he was
[2:27:08] 6ot or he was one M wide by the
[2:27:12] chest he only tells us the
[2:27:15] character that he gave him that is what
[2:27:19] makes a man
[2:27:22] amen and Christ was not judged by
[2:27:25] physical
[2:27:27] strength he was judged by
[2:27:30] character when Isaiah looked into the
[2:27:32] spirit
[2:27:34] world and they saw Christ his
[2:27:37] description of Christ could not reflect
[2:27:41] what the kind of
[2:27:44] image today's preacher would want to
[2:27:47] portray of Christ
[2:27:52] now when Isaiah looked into the
[2:27:55] eternity and he saw the coming forth of
[2:27:58] that
[2:28:00] prophecy he says unto us a son is
[2:28:04] born and when he looked at him
[2:28:08] clearly in Isaiah
[2:28:11] 53 he started to describe the
[2:28:14] son in verse two for he shall grow up
[2:28:18] before him as a tender
[2:28:22] and the root out of a dry
[2:28:24] ground he has no
[2:28:27] form C and when we shall see him there's
[2:28:32] no beauty that we should
[2:28:34] desire
[2:28:36] des and rejected of men a man of
[2:28:41] sorrow acquainted with G and he do it
[2:28:46] weigh our faces from him
[2:28:50] except by
[2:28:53] Revelation hallelujah hallelujah
[2:28:55] everybody he
[2:28:58] Des except by
[2:29:00] Revelation because his character and in
[2:29:04] his nature amen was not what the men
[2:29:08] wanted to
[2:29:10] see amen they could have wanted to
[2:29:14] see great big
[2:29:16] giants but when is
[2:29:20] says that he grows up like a
[2:29:24] tender man who comes before them there
[2:29:28] was no might no glory no power in the
[2:29:30] human
[2:29:34] flesh what makes a man young girls who
[2:29:38] are here
[2:29:39] today is not the strength of that
[2:29:43] body height of that
[2:29:45] man the money it is the quality of spell
[2:29:51] which is described in
[2:29:54] Genesis
[2:29:56] 127
[2:29:58] genis are you together with me yes sir
[2:30:03] Christ was defined by
[2:30:06] character brother Bram said I have seen
[2:30:10] men that weigh 200
[2:30:15] pound and and and didn't have an ounce
[2:30:19] of a man
[2:30:23] is
[2:30:28] measured but you are a man in the
[2:30:31] house and you are making your wife cry
[2:30:34] every
[2:30:35] [Music]
[2:30:40] day I know the
[2:30:43] sister she could cry over good
[2:30:46] things and could cry over bad things
[2:30:51] when she was sick she would
[2:30:53] cry when you sympathize with her she
[2:30:55] would
[2:30:57] cry
[2:31:00] woman praise the Lord PA said I knew of
[2:31:06] a 14 years ago either in the body I
[2:31:11] don't know whether in the spirit don't
[2:31:15] know praise the Lord God bless you so a
[2:31:19] true husband must display the Redemptive
[2:31:24] character because God allowed the
[2:31:26] relationship of husband
[2:31:30] and the Rel
[2:31:35] chur so a man was first referred to as a
[2:31:40] man in the
[2:31:43] separation in Genesis
[2:31:46] 2 verse am man
[2:31:50] leave his father
[2:31:52] and so what made a man was the
[2:31:56] separation and at this separation there
[2:32:00] were certain
[2:32:02] responsibilities that a man was supposed
[2:32:04] to
[2:32:07] play the things that went with
[2:32:10] him in the
[2:32:14] separation That's What Makes a
[2:32:17] Man we've seen what makes man
[2:32:21] created the image the likeness but then
[2:32:25] in the
[2:32:26] separation the man took certain part and
[2:32:30] woman took another
[2:32:31] part so if you don't play the part of a
[2:32:36] man then you are not a
[2:32:41] man I Thank God I'm a
[2:32:47] man is
[2:32:56] am let us see the Maj
[2:32:59] qualities that
[2:33:05] man you know when the fall
[2:33:09] came man
[2:33:11] fell from two
[2:33:14] qualities let's go to Genesis chapter
[2:33:17] 2 verse 5
[2:33:20] and try to understand
[2:33:25] that and every plant of the
[2:33:30] Feld before it was in the
[2:33:34] Earth every of the
[2:33:38] field before it grew for the Lord
[2:33:42] God not caused it rain upon the
[2:33:46] Earth and there was not
[2:33:51] man to te the
[2:33:55] ground are you together with me they
[2:33:57] have not put on the body yet
[2:34:01] either but God is looking forward for a
[2:34:05] [Applause]
[2:34:09] man to the ground there was not a
[2:34:13] man to te the ground so a man was formed
[2:34:17] in the body
[2:34:20] to occupy his inheritance the
[2:34:25] Earth and also to work
[2:34:29] it amen that was the purpose of a
[2:34:35] man to come upon the Earth and tender
[2:34:39] the Earth he must have a
[2:34:43] desire to work and feed his
[2:34:48] family are you together with me that's a
[2:34:51] man so even in the fall the
[2:34:56] responsibility to feed his
[2:34:58] family still laid on
[2:35:04] him because the scripture
[2:35:06] say in the sweat of thy
[2:35:11] face shalt thou eat
[2:35:14] bread till Thou shalt return out the
[2:35:17] ground
[2:35:19] for out of
[2:35:21] it was thou
[2:35:23] taken and for
[2:35:26] death thou
[2:35:27] art and out un dust Thou shalt
[2:35:32] return did you hear that that was the
[2:35:36] thing that was committed to man after
[2:35:39] the
[2:35:42] fall lost two
[2:35:45] things the first thing he
[2:35:47] lost he lost eternal
[2:35:52] life in four he lost the glory of
[2:35:56] God he came short into physical contact
[2:36:03] with and when anybody else was
[2:36:07] born
[2:36:10] after
[2:36:14] byor we lost physical
[2:36:17] contact with our
[2:36:21] are you together with me amen and the
[2:36:24] next thing he lost was his
[2:36:31] inheritance two
[2:36:33] things and brother Bram in the brid
[2:36:36] message
[2:36:38] says he lost his
[2:36:40] inheritance when he lost his
[2:36:43] fellowship and right to
[2:36:46] life remember that day you eat there
[2:36:51] you
[2:36:52] die he says he lost his
[2:36:56] inheritance what was the inheritance the
[2:36:59] Earth that's the reason why you don't
[2:37:02] want to
[2:37:05] die because this is your
[2:37:08] inheritance the
[2:37:11] Earth you
[2:37:13] scramble you go to
[2:37:16] doctor you sell all your property
[2:37:20] because you want to remain
[2:37:25] here Heaven is not our
[2:37:29] home that's just going to be a resting
[2:37:33] place where we go just wait for the
[2:37:38] cleansing of the
[2:37:40] earth and then we come back
[2:37:45] here that's why you don't want to die
[2:37:49] because God made you to be
[2:37:52] here I know sister doesn't want to
[2:37:58] die nobody
[2:38:01] wants you may be here and
[2:38:04] suffer you might be a poor man but there
[2:38:07] is something that binds you
[2:38:10] here this is your
[2:38:14] home we lost it
[2:38:19] to
[2:38:20] see then brother Bram says and when he
[2:38:24] lost his
[2:38:26] life he also lost his inheritance in
[2:38:30] life two
[2:38:33] things because he had complet Supreme C
[2:38:36] of the
[2:38:38] earth he was a god of the
[2:38:42] earth God is the god of the universe
[2:38:49] amen but his son had this Earth under
[2:38:53] his
[2:38:55] control he could
[2:38:57] speak he could
[2:39:00] name he could say he could stop
[2:39:04] nature he could do
[2:39:06] anything but when he did that what did
[2:39:11] he
[2:39:11] do he lost his
[2:39:16] inhance So Adam could not change
[2:39:21] the order of the Chim in
[2:39:24] heaven but he could change the layout of
[2:39:28] [Applause]
[2:39:34] the has seen you for a long
[2:39:38] time
[2:39:40] now go to the
[2:39:43] mountain and then UPS Mountain come
[2:39:47] here are you together with
[2:39:49] he had the power of
[2:39:55] nature that's why you find
[2:39:57] out that in the
[2:40:00] battle Joshua could stop the
[2:40:03] sun because it was something
[2:40:07] natural are you together with me that's
[2:40:10] why brother Bram could stop the storms
[2:40:14] because that's something natural but we
[2:40:17] cannot change the order of
[2:40:20] the we cannot change the order of
[2:40:26] theab so in creation man was given
[2:40:31] responsibility over the
[2:40:34] Earth to feed his
[2:40:36] family she the
[2:40:39] wife relies on
[2:40:41] him in
[2:40:43] feeding and
[2:40:45] [Music]
[2:40:46] maintaining understanding of God
[2:40:54] when we get a
[2:40:57] church with husbands who are students of
[2:41:00] the
[2:41:01] world we cannot get a desolate Church
[2:41:04] like
[2:41:05] that there will always be the power to
[2:41:10] replenish hallelujah hallelujah after
[2:41:13] this pastor is
[2:41:14] godone another man Even a greater
[2:41:18] revelation to the
[2:41:22] gift when this Deacon is gone there will
[2:41:25] come another one the anointing to
[2:41:30] replenish must the church the anointing
[2:41:34] to
[2:41:35] multiply must be in the
[2:41:38] [Applause]
[2:41:40] church praise God she relies on
[2:41:44] him he must be a hard
[2:41:47] worker and he must be a good
[2:41:53] student he gave
[2:41:55] Eve her
[2:41:58] perers
[2:42:00] listen and she jumped those
[2:42:04] perimeters to test Adam's Redemptive
[2:42:11] nature if knew she would not go into
[2:42:15] those territories without his presence
[2:42:20] because he had the glory that would keep
[2:42:25] way
[2:42:27] evil but he walked out and went into the
[2:42:35] trees to tast the Redemptive
[2:42:42] powers and I
[2:42:44] know you
[2:42:46] know when Adam heard the SC
[2:42:51] he ran and went out
[2:42:53] there and the woman became a merchant as
[2:42:56] they said the other
[2:42:59] day and she so the
[2:43:03] idea and
[2:43:05] wonder I leave her there I will lose her
[2:43:10] I must go over there to get her back
[2:43:14] here Adam does not say how many times
[2:43:20] will I tell
[2:43:28] you Adam just says no I am her
[2:43:34] Redeemer going to get her back Satan
[2:43:38] give her
[2:43:41] back and he took her
[2:43:44] back are you together with me you don't
[2:43:48] have to start saying I told you last I
[2:43:51] told I'm saying this because I'm a
[2:43:54] pastor I have heard that many
[2:43:56] times sister I told
[2:43:59] you you are calling her sister but the
[2:44:02] way you are acting is not
[2:44:08] brotherly a man will not only provide
[2:44:12] bread and
[2:44:16] butter but he will be
[2:44:20] constant
[2:44:23] Redeemer seven times seven times a
[2:44:30] day the same the same num of
[2:44:35] times the Lord would redeem you back
[2:44:38] every
[2:44:41] day and I know that a real
[2:44:45] wife will not like to be stubborn
[2:44:49] so that she can to be
[2:44:53] redeemed a real sister won't do that
[2:44:56] this is the
[2:44:59] balance we can go
[2:45:01] forward amen
[2:45:05] amen I like to have a
[2:45:08] church with
[2:45:11] real that's the only way we can
[2:45:16] replenish and keep maintaining the life
[2:45:19] of the holy spirit in the
[2:45:23] church when
[2:45:31] men let's go to
[2:45:33] Isaiah
[2:45:39] chapter he replenishes the
[2:45:43] life right from his family
[2:45:52] do you love
[2:45:53] him okay Isaiah 38
[2:45:58] verse1 he says in those
[2:46:02] days was eah sick
[2:46:08] death and Isaiah the prophet the son of
[2:46:11] Amos came unto
[2:46:14] him and he said thus says the Lord
[2:46:19] set thine house in
[2:46:21] order for Thou shalt not
[2:46:26] leave you will
[2:46:29] die had heah done anything
[2:46:34] wrong
[2:46:36] no but the living
[2:46:41] di so prepare your
[2:46:45] family because you are not going to be
[2:46:47] here forever
[2:46:51] that is a
[2:46:52] man every day he's preparing for his
[2:46:56] departure hallelujah hallelujah when he
[2:46:59] earns some money he's going to buy some
[2:47:02] land there because he knows he's not
[2:47:06] going to live here
[2:47:08] forever he will try to build a house
[2:47:11] because he knows he will die he will not
[2:47:15] leave he preparing for his departure
[2:47:20] amen are you here amen you
[2:47:24] prepare praise God now the Bible has
[2:47:29] introduced us to this
[2:47:31] man who had the quality of
[2:47:34] spirit and his name was
[2:47:38] eah he began as a young God-fearing
[2:47:43] man different from the Rich Young
[2:47:46] [Applause]
[2:47:47] Ruler because had detached
[2:47:50] life he had that experience with
[2:47:54] God he ped after David the
[2:47:59] king amen because when we go back into
[2:48:03] the Gen of
[2:48:06] Christ we say that and gave birth to
[2:48:11] David they don't stop there they said
[2:48:14] David the
[2:48:17] king and then David gave birth to
[2:48:21] Solomon Solomon was the king but they
[2:48:26] don't meaning that David was the
[2:48:31] patter of Kings that's why when Jesus is
[2:48:35] coming back he comes back as a son of
[2:48:39] David because David was the perfect
[2:48:44] [Music]
[2:48:46] K are you together with
[2:48:49] so now he ped after
[2:48:52] David because he was a king and he says
[2:48:55] I don't want to be like a
[2:48:57] soul I don't want to be like a soul I
[2:49:01] want to look at the
[2:49:02] pattern and the pattern in area
[2:49:06] here is King
[2:49:09] David oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't
[2:49:12] want to be anything else in the age
[2:49:15] where we are we have about the son of
[2:49:18] man
[2:49:20] Ministry I don't want to
[2:49:23] P of the great
[2:49:25] [Applause]
[2:49:27] preachers that I have heard
[2:49:29] about men who are pre wonderful
[2:49:35] things the ministry of the son
[2:49:37] of going to the
[2:49:40] messages going to the books where I want
[2:49:44] to Hallelujah Hallelujah that was
[2:49:47] Hezekiah
[2:49:49] ped after
[2:49:52] David and the Lord prospered him in his
[2:49:57] ministry as a
[2:49:59] king he broke the high
[2:50:02] places he broke the present
[2:50:08] serpent amen put people into the present
[2:50:12] to test
[2:50:14] truth so that the people would be able
[2:50:17] to hear God
[2:50:19] the prophets and his priests he trusted
[2:50:23] God and held fir on the
[2:50:26] word the Bible says he also

[2:56:27] choose he saying all
[2:56:31] males in the Feast of un
[2:56:36] bread in the Feast of
[2:56:39] Wis in the Feast of
[2:56:42] Tabernacles and they shall not appear

[2:58:09] says they shall
[2:58:11] appear if we had time we would have
[2:58:14] broken down those
[2:58:15] feasts so God cared about the male
[2:58:19] children because they are carriers of
[2:58:22] the
[2:58:23] seat man and a man so in Tye the male
[2:58:31] retained the
[2:58:35] image and the
[2:58:37] female always tapped into that
[2:58:42] image the males they rain the image of
[2:58:46] Christ
[2:58:48] that the female May tap into
[2:58:52] that and even in the applying of the
[2:58:55] token the men were
[2:58:59] circumcised and the women were

[2:59:14] [Music]
[2:59:15] church when we have men who are weak
[2:59:20] they just have a habit of coming to
[2:59:23] church then we don't have a future of
[2:59:25] the
[2:59:28] church God is not talking about the
[2:59:31] women he says the
[2:59:33] males shall appear
[2:59:36] before the emphasis that been placed on
[2:59:40] the
[2:59:42] men and he says in verse
[2:59:45] 17 every man

[3:02:34] perfect life sinned against the and God
[3:02:37] said yes and then yes and then yes and
[3:02:41] then he says father forgive me give me

[3:03:20] living there must be living
[3:03:26] men you wonder all the property was left
[3:03:29] in that
[3:03:31] church they walked away from the types

[3:05:14] paid ties the Bible says Li pay ties
[3:05:18] when he went down as a great commander
[3:05:21] and he fought those many kings look at
[3:05:24] Judah they come down here and they
