testimonies from here but I heard him saying when I'm called to minister here I see what can I Minister just wait upon that's what every minister is just do whatever the Lord just gives you so I know

[Music] Bibles we just go St Luke let's again read these words in the spirit then that will be good enough for us as they say one word is enough for a wise man even if you can be edified in one word or in one song that's good enough you may even find you already edified by the singing of the choir or in the songs the song leader was bringing so we just continue deeper deeper in the RO we just continue adding on and on yeah so we just read from verse one and came to pass that as the people placed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of gare verse one they were pressing on Jesus in order to hear the word of God they were Desiring to hear more of the word of God you have anyone who came here hungering to hear more of the okay let's proceed verse two and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets verse three and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and T the people out of the verse four now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon runch out into the deep and let your nets for a drought Amina that's where my title is coming from verse five and Simon answering said unto him Master we have to all the night and have taken nothing never the at Thy word I will let down the net let's have a word of prayer Jesus we have read these words which apostle Luke wrote what happened this day father so father we are here today I know they were written for our purpose so father may you anoint them again and we will also be blessed through the sharing of the word this morning for the glory and honor of your name in the mighty name of Jesus Christ I pray you may get seated yeah verse four when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out the deep and let down your net for Dr blessed be the name of the Lord we are sharing something very little you have enough very good ministers and enjoy the word of God but as I said we are just adding a very little because everybody who stands on the pit is just for the perfecting of the bride of Christ just reach before the Lord Jesus perfected I believe we shall also be blessed this morning I want us to get the little story what happened this day I see people very hungry hungering for the word of God they were blessing one another wanting to hear the word of God and Jesus called their spirit and he had to give them what they wanted we find him finding the ships there he picks one of the ships that's asked the owner gave it to him said let us push it a little blessed be the name of the Lord he sat in the boat and started giving the people the word of blessed be the name of the Lord then he tell Simon that the deep and let down your nets for a drought morning I'm sharing something very little the title is out into the deep there is a voice telling you and me that my brother my sister don't give up justun out a little deep you receive your cat blessed be the there is a voice telling you this morning that out into the deep for your C bless I repeat it there is someone telling you that out a little deep for you are C blessed be the of the Lord when he said that here the words of the Apostle Peter and said master told all the night my brother my sister I don't know what you are passing through I hope you are well taught that there is never been a pastor when is there in the office then the pastor tells him brother I'm inviting you you come and preach to my people tell them about this tell them about this they have this habit they have this it's not that visiting Pastor to to tell them about their not his responsibility to come and tell those habits but is the RO to take it out so sometimes it has happened in my church a pastor can stand and speak speaks things which are exactly in the church like the cases you have been when he has never heard of them then you find someone who is says the pastor has told him some pastors even call out names V just calls you gives you as a reference where is not him but the Lord speaking to and then you get annoyed you say Pastor has told him never never never it's never blessed be the name of the Lord so here we see the Lord Jesus Peter said Master we have to all the night these people had to they had fished these were expert fishermen really expert fishermen and they had really done all their best throughout the night and had not CAU anything had not CAU any fish here we see them very comfortably washing their Nets they had lost all their hopes my brother my sister the Lord could have sent me to tell you that there is a situation you have been passing through I don't mind how many years I don't mind how long how much you have prayed and you never got to relief but this morning I'm telling you this can be your day for your visitation for your deliverance just receive what the Lord has sent for you so no matter these people are to all the night and that's why they told our Jesus Christ we have to all the night nothing blessed the I have prayed for 20 years I have never answer my prayer has never been answered my brother my sister this morning I'm here to tell you don't give up out into the deep continue pressing go your hour is coming your day is coming your prayer to be answered and it can this morning because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever just receive him that's enough for you and just continue serving him never give up never grown just continue praising God then what do we see Peter saying I love his answer he said never the let me neveress aty word I will let the net now you and me let's continue and see when he let the net down in the sea what happen let's continue the story a little bit then we talk a little more and we Closs hallelujah hallelujah verse six and when they had this done they enclosed a mude of fishes and Bre hallelujah hallelujah indeed they got their catch ver s and they be to their Partners who were in The Other sheep that they should come and help them and they came and fed the sheeps so that they began to S blessed be the name of the Lord my brother my sister what happened this day in the lifetime of of Simon never seen it to catch fish to fond your they are fill and they begin sinking of the weight of the fish had never seen it and this morning I'm telling you this Jesus is here to do you something you have never seen in your life something you have never attained in what you could have been toing for when you look at these Apostles they were at at their place of dut they were doing their fishing let the Lord Jesus Christ find you doing he will perform the same Miracle to you bless of Lord only he wants to find you doing he wants to find you in your rightful position and he will perform what he promised to you bless this day they saw something they have never seen before Hallelujah huj holding on that just holding on that just a little bit I feel I should join it with this quotation here Prophet messenger just a part he say something this and uh let's just uh have it right herea be the name of the Lord he says I'm going to give you the quotation he says I want blessed be the name of the Lord okay let's take this he says this is a message demonology a message demonology uh 20th November 53 the prophet says watch what is taking place now watch what is taking place now the church is rising when we talk of a church you know what a church is the church is you and me you are not supposed to be seated you are supposed to be rising up the church is rising brother the power of God the ti The Tide is High The Tide is High I think is the wings The Tide is High moving on we are going from deeper depths height Hallelujah the old fashioned Apostolic pcal power of God DW on the disciples is coming back to the disciples again the Pentecostal P power on the apostles on the disciples today now now is falling on us the dises of Jesus Christ so that's why I'm saying whatever he did there is here to do it again for you and for me blessed be the name of the Lord he says the old fashioned Apostolic Pentecostal power of God on the disciples is coming back to the disciples again the prophet says that's right and I believe that things that you have never never heard about blessed be the of Lord things you have never heard about is right now in making my sister my brother is right now in making the things you have never seen the request you have presented to the Lord for a long time the spiritual world just I wish you would enter in the spirit and you see them the prophet is say in making right now something can happen to you you can receive your Miracle this morning which you have been praying for for so long something you have never seen something you have never heard is in making right now hallelujah hallelujah it can be in making for someone my brother my sister but something because the same power Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever whatever he did in his days he still doing today so today is asking you to go deeper and higher in his word then you receive your blessing something you have never heard before something you have never seen right now Hallelujah the prophet says I feel it tonight like a new person just to know that the power is here I wish everyone would know that the power of the Lord Jesus Christ is here in our me that the Lord Jesus Christ is here in our something you may have never had before something you have never seen the prophet is telling you is encouraging you this morning he giving me this words to minister to you they are in making now they in progress now I can say your Miracle is just closer to you so I just caution you don't give up my brother you know a Christian and he says here a little in a message the come he said you are a Christian believer and you have been seeking God for a deeper walk with God every Christian believer his desire her desire is to have a deeper relationship with God and continue pressing not to give up not to relax now here we see the disciples back to the back to where we read they were relaxed they were washing their Nets you know in the physical they were right because they had toed all the night and Fisher believe that fish is caught in the night I see Fisher here there could be some fishermen fish many they fish in the night but this is in day time Jesus come and tell that you can cat in theal it was almost impossible but once Peter said Thy word I will cast my n he a ro of fish be the name of the Lord let's continue reading verse when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at his at Jesus's feet saying depart from me I am a sinful man for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of zeed who were partners with Simon and Jesus said fear not from hfor Thou shalt catch men hallu hallu bless the of the Lord my brother my sister we are fishermen we are supposed to fish men we are supposed to bring people to Christ we are supposed to bring them to the Lord but how do we bring them what life do we live outside there don't tell me that I been in Salvation for 20 years this morning I want to ask you a question how old are you in how close are in how deep are you in Christ and when I talk about this it applies to everyone it applies to everyone here how old are you in Christ you quickly give me an answer four years in Salvation that's nothing I'm 20 years in Salvation but that's nothing the most important thing is you and Christ how much have you grown in Christ you find someone who has been in Salvation for 20 years but he behaves like a non believer the behaviors are like believer and you me being ination for years my brother my sister let's get deeper in the Lord Jesus Christ's get closer to the Lord Jesus Christ and you know the prophet says as we near his coming how should we be looking right we should be more more and more like him and this is what every preacher does striving and making everyone to be more like Jesus we should Lear to be like Jesus like the singer says to be like Jesus us I WR to be like Jesus this is my desire I want to be like Jesus bless be the name of the Lord when Peter saw he said get away I'm a wicked man not want to see such a powerful mirus said fear from hence forth you are going to be a fisherman of men the Lord has a message for you this morning he wants you to get out of where you are he wants you to realize who you are he wants you to know why you believe blessed be the name of the US not just be in the church yes being in the church is very good being a good church member is very good but is that good enough blessed be the name of the how old are you in Christ this is the question I'm giving you how close are you in the RO so let us grow deeper and deeper You singer are you singing to please people when they you then you feel that it that song should change you it does not change you then you are singing for nothing you preacher that's why the prophet say leave me a sermon yes I don't need your words leave me a someon we are here to Theon my brother my sister blessed be the name of the Lord so my dear Breen how old are we today we need to think about that hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord now run out into the deep out into the deep blessed be the name of the Lord Peter was in raed go into deeper waters in order to catch fish he had to go deeper bless this means venturing beyond our comfort zone you find many Christians are living a very comfortable life you totable coming we must Venture Beyond comfortable zones and go deeper in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah we must go deeper because Comfort zones Comfort zones my brother my sister they can limit you not to grow hallelujah hallelujah Comfort zon Comfort zones not you to go deep spiritually you must we have sung a song I surrender

learning to be in the presence of the Lord seeking God's presence seeking God's to be in God's presence and everything you do doing it by God's [Applause] guidance what does the Lord say about this bless the of what made these Apostles saw the miracle taking Jesus Christ at his word personal pronoun I will cast down my NE Hallelujah every Christian should to stay in the presence of the the major problem is we get in the presence of the Lord when we are in churches but the moment We Live Here We Live Another Life my brother my sister you are wasting your time here we are supposed to live in the presence of the Lord going by the guidance of the Lord everything we do we must be guided by the Lord uring that is the Lord leading then you will never go wrong my Hallelujah I'm still in the

the for information the other song we are saying blessed the of the Lord you must even Embrace embracing any uncertainity that comes to you anything that in Christianity Christianity is not a picnic it's not an EAS life that everything will go smooth you encounter some hard things but in hard things how are you standing they should make you closer to the Lord you must cry to the Lord more than you have ever cried to him before but when you have been when you have been in friendship with Christ whatever comes to you it goes very easy hallelujah hallelujah remember the story The Prophet gave of a lady who was crossing the lake as she was in the ship and she the winds threatened them and the the pirate he said let everyone cry to his and started Muslims then he saw one was just seated not mind then he came to here why are you not praying she said no why should I pray when I was leaving home I prayed and across there I'm going to see my children my daughter and if I don't reach there if we go if we sink I have my daughters who went ahead of me she was not worried where that cross the SE or to die a Christian is not worried whatever comes your way when you been deep in the Lord Jesus blessed brother sister sinc speaking you think wasas for I want you to think about it hallelujah hallelujah the prophet says that I think nebz said these fools are just joking thinking I'm joking I'm going to show them what I am I'm going to show them they have to know today who I am but what were they saying they will say our Lord we respect you we give you your salute but we are not careful even how we answer you we know our Ro the God we serve the God We Are The God Who is in US is more than able to Deliver Us from the finest fire hallelujah look at their confession more than able to Deliver Us from the fin fire and if he does not deliver us we shall not worship your God strong deep in the RO Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah it was not e my brother my sister and it was real but they stood stand strong because they were deep in the Lord Jesus Christ and when time came I love I when I want you read the scripture it's very interesting that day the Kingz he Ro the most professional armies he looked for the best seven army men to come and tie these three men they were younger boys like this but they brought the the Commandos you see there is a painful feel I saw when they arrested an Israelite these Jews and they tied him with chains they Ted he was one person he was ch on the tree listen to this brother there something I'm bring they TI him on the tree proper legs and arms with chains blessed the name of the Lord and aftering him on the chains that was not enough for them they had to get strong powerful people with the guns strong guns they took cover I was wondering he's already tied with chains what is scaring you blessed the of what you want in them they know that this man here there is a God he serves he can deliver him from this bless be the name of that is not enough for them so they had to take cover remember that's what they do to our Lord Jesus Christ they put him in the grave put a strong Stone and they commanded command blessed be the of no he's already dead they saw he was dead but because he had the same on the third day I hallelujah hallelujah that is our confidence my brother so these people here after tying him the other ones with their guns then they started cutting him cut cutting him they were all scared but I learn something we serve a powerful God my if you can go deep in intimacy with him it's your greatest Victory before us fall in love with our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah the answer of everything Blessed Be let's get deep and let's trust him get out of our comfort look at Apostle Peter when they were in the sea and they were scared now and the winds were torturing them and Jesus was not with them then they saw Jesus coming on the water it was scary then look at one one of them he said if it be you my Lord let me also come to you is did he walk on water the answer is yes Peter was able to walk on water why because he he had fa in him he had enough face to walk on water with our lord Jesus chist we see all the sense in the Bible those who were in close relationship who there God they reive their Victory hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord bled the Lord what comes last you see when these Apostles called fish they called their friends my brother my sister be prepared call your relatives so after God answering your prayers so long as you can take a step and go deep in the Lord Jesus CHR Ure that you you add on what you have like teaches us of perfect man you have faith yes virtue okay you have got virtue have patience let us PR Perfection my brother my sister blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm here telling you the is not happy with anyone turning back blessed be the let us fix our eyes on Jesus Paul says Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10 Pastor told me I don't mind about the time and I just thought I would just preach for 20 or 30 minutes those I'm Bing just bear with me a little but I'm not Bing anyone I believe [Applause] Hallelujah let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 just I'm now I'm going to skip most of the things of my notes Here start from that so you have need of patience that let me first read it you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise hallelujah hallelujah for and he that shall come will come and will not our Lord Jesus Christ is at verse 38 now that now now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but maybe I put myself I don't know how many are here okay well I know there are some here let me join them but we are not of them who draw back into petion but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul [Applause] hu hallelujah amen say I mean Philippians pH that I have not attained I've not got to what I'm looking for but what I'm looking at just forgetting those things behind we can read it let's read it Philippians chapter 3 we shall just read a few verses there from verse 10 we can start from there yeah soter 3 verse 10 me that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and The Fellowship of the suffering be being made conformable un his death might attain to Resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either way already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended ofes Breen I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the priz of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen amen 13 and 14 Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord let that be the desire of everying out the de hallelujah hallelujah Ephesians 3 I'm still myse verse 3 ver Ephesians he says may be may be able to comprehend with all things with all s what is the breadth and length and depth and height know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah hallelujah verse now him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask of we ask or think according to the power that works in US verse 21 be in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen hallelujah hallelujah all me to conclude with the words of a prophet here how is cautioning us how to go deeper depths in the Jesus he spoke this in the message in the church age book Church age thean Church age then he says these words I'm just heing now uh he says they have not known depth of Saturn they have not known the depth of Saturn it seems that this verse is quoting this very scripture that seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators they were not able to figure out what Doctrine what experiences are meant by this phrase Prophet says actually it is simple to know what is meant let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the dep of Satan so which means if you are not in the depth of God not deep if you don't want to launch deeper in the Lord Jesus Christ you are launching deeper in sat and Satan is toed so my brother my sister let us deeper into the Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah yeah I'm told today we have a second service uh where we shall have the communion be the name of the is that it still so that is still so and also everywhere we don't force people to take the supper hallelujah hallelujah oh communion it is your choice and I know like everywhere there will be people going not taking the road before you go I'm talking to that person could be a visitor here just on my behalf I was I I'm requesting all of you to be there I say even if you are not to take it at least join us in that service be with us in that service blessed be the name of the Lord be with us it's like when we are baptizing and it's good everyone has to participate watch blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm also asking at least everyone to be there so why there are things we remind ourselves which are very important to all of us as Christians blessed be the name of very important to all of us as Christians blessed be the of Lord because there are three there are three important ordinances which our Lord Jesus Christ commands us to do in the flesh blessed be the name of the Lord if we are Christians I want you to hear those few words which I'm trying to say that those ordinances we are commanded to do them in the flesh so that's why I would urge at everyone to be there and at least we remind ourselves of those things blessed be the name of the Lord because for the sake of those who are going some could be our visitors as I said and some could just be going listen to these words just I want to throw to you these few words the prophet says now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is communion another one is Fe washing another one is water baptism let me pause a little bit if you were baptized because we know very well that baptism is only one there is only and only one BM which must be in mansion in much water and in the name of our Lord Jesus chist for the remission of our sins and for what after that you receive the Holy Ghost you receive you connect with the Lord connection with the Blessed the name of now let me use this word it's aity if you were bed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and therefore we call you a believer a message believer because if you die now we shall bu you as our brother or sister that you don't take communion don't worry if you don't like me I'm here for one day but let me tell you because I'm given this privilege it's a pity you were baptized you you heard the message about baptism and you received it grad and you embrace the message of the but whenever it comes to commun you don't want to take it my sister my brother why it's aity blessed be the name of the Lord hey they say if you take it when your life is not right you eating for yourself condation so you that and like that you people in communion and [Music] die you have a chance today repent of your sins put yourself right with God right here to receive you back and you take communion with your people blessed this is a very important event in the life of a Christian and you should thank your pastor because he puts that provision for you he fulfills everything the word requires hallelujah hallelujah your when you always miss theer hallelujah hallelujah some may not like this but let me continue he says that's the only three things that is the Perfection hallelujah hallelujah which means these things take us into perfection how many believe that hallelujah hallelujah because these are the ordinances of our Lord Jesus Christ he left them for us to do communion waterm and blessed be the name of the Lord very very important for my your Perfection these are not my words hallelujah hallelujah of the three those three bring us take us Perfection and that's the only three orders we have we realize that that was the issue given by St Paul in the New Testament if we would say the communion should just be take the communion should just be taking the word you just say I have eaten yes my brother s even here we have already communed we have enjoyed the word you have been feeding on the word that is communion real communion blessed be the but you must also do this of bread and wine Hallelujah he says if you just take it for granted that's only the word I hear is enough listen listen my brother I want to leave these words to those who are going away they gave a prover there's a proverb which says I not bring it well let me I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord supper until he Hasen the word of the Lord into his he must be a genuine believer the word of God and is ruling in his life and has pushed him into relationship with Christ Hallelujah so the prophet says I don't believe of anyone taking theer the Lord supper he has taken the word of the Lord into his heart are we together he says because I'm going says I will read something for you in a few moments not then why then why we would on the same basis 19 says on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation if you can say eating the word of God of the preacher that's enough you don't to go the roer then the prophet says the Salvation arm denomination is correct in other words you wasted your time coming in the message have remained there the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism listen to this for them they don't believe in what they don't believe in waterm why then why are we baptized the water cannot save you the blood saves you that's how they believe and someh is true it's not this water that saves you let me continue I will agree with that the prophet says I will agree with that he says I will agree with that that that's right the blood saves you not the water not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of Grace has been done blessed be the name of the Lord this water is has no power to save but this water represents the blood of Jesus and when you do this physically it is an evidence that there is something which is done in let me give you a testimony we are going to the to bapti and we are baptizing one brother anyone of you can maybe could be one who knows him he a police off by names ofus he's a police officer this is the truth this brother he was really an evil man even himself still testifies he was an officer was really very corrupt who was really immoral he would say if in a day we could say I want to sleep with five women his testimony was no woman could refuse him which means he had some powers of but there is one woman he tried and defeated him that was my wife operating a sh he he saw a very beautiful ready said this one I will finish her today when he just pushed some few words to her had a small English Bible said officer better get take this word of God and you better be saved she had no conversation with him that word kept on haunting him kept on haunting him until one night by then anywhere with brother so that boy that brother at night The Voice came and spoke to him if you don't get saved today you are dead feared woke up deep in the night came and woke with the brother brother fellow policeman please I have had such and such I want to be sa I want to be saved today now now you pray for me the brother prayed for him in church now listen to this when we took him for water to to be baptized I was I don't know God gave me wisdom I went in water with another Pastor Sunday we went there two of us the Lord spoke to us we went there two brother sister we just dipped the brother in water in the name of our Lord Jesus brother became I don't know how many times he almost we almost Dred in the water we struggled with the man then we lifted him and put him in the boat and put aside do you know his testimony he said the moment we said I said I bapti you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ he said the whole leg turned into [Music] blood saw the water became blood the like they said the darkness was touchable which was hiding the children of Israel from the Egyptians or like the stones which were bur to ashes which I mean on brother saw the water which Wasing from that day all those demons that were operating in him they died completely hallelujah hallelujah he would about himself am I the one who can look at woman now and I don't admire don't that di this is what our Prophet is telling us my brother this baptism we receive this very crucial in our life so if you received that baptism my dear brother sister it's the same thing with communion very very important in your life Jesus Christ said do continue doing this in remance of me Hallelujah so if you just say the sharing of the word is enough for me I don't need to go communion take these issues very serious hallelujah hallelujah do you still love me hallelujah hallelujah I would proph say I would agree with that he says that's right the blood saves saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of Grace has been done he says you see so must we own commun hallelujah hallelujah if you are privileged that there's communion it's a must for you to take it if you understand it verse 21ag 21 when we have taken the road our sacrifice into us take into you as a matter of spiritual birth into us and his body we live by him we live by his word we also should symbolize it because a commandment repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Paul said I have received of the Lord that which I also deliver unto you that the the same night in the which was betrayed he took bread and break it and gave it to the disciples and say Take and Eat This do in remance of me listen to this for as often as you take this bread you show forth his death he comes now we find out that in that they had people who come the precious Brothers dear brother he came and he said I never take it brother Bram I don't take communion I don't understand what it is said I been told the other side I said but remember will you remember we will admit that Paul S Paul in the Christian church they went from church from house to house with sing of now I say he did it he did put it in the church and Gans one says if an angel from heaven comes and says anything be you see one that had them to be reaped again from the baptism of John in the of our Jesus Christ there are three things that we must three things that we must do as symbols the RO supper Wasing and water baptism you say salvation takes it from The Point Salvation it from the point they can say the dying Thief when he died he was not [Music] baptized Jesus said he would be in heaven that's exactly the truth that's exact but you see he only recognized Jesus there in the hour he was dying you see what I'm saying don't refuse baptism if you have never been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins when an opportunity is there please use it he says this on the on the cross you only had his message that day for you you have been listening to it you been hearing it when you refuse it and die die a so is the other two the same thing with the other twoing and communion hallelu he says only opportunity he had he was aief he was away he was out and he as soon as he seen that right he recogniz my brother my sister you could have been one of them may you please recognize that this is very important for you very important for you in your Christian Life can you recognize it like this recognization then you say remember me that was true but to you and I who know that we should be baptized and refuse to do it then that will be between you and God listen same thing in communion if you don't take it it's not my duty between you hallelujah hallelujah the prophet continues and says now when we take this communion it is not just the thing say I'm coming up here and going to eat that bread and I will be I am a Christian but if you notice the Bible says he that eats and drinks andity of the blood and the of the Lord you got to live a life before the people and before God and the people show that you are sincere you must do everything sincity there are some ifs I wanted to give you if there are some statements I wanted to give you seven statements which the prophet gave that if if if I wanted to give them for those who are going away but I am now convinced nobody is going so we shall continue the second Serv I just say even if you are not going to take it I'm inviting you hallelujah hallelujah just be in that communion communion service then the rest you the rest you canip I can say but I believe we have learned something hallelujah hallelujah so let us launch deeper deeper in the I can say also communion know we shall talk in the afternoon it keeps you prayed up it keeps you checking yourself actually even as we finish this service you are free to continue in the presence of the Lord and rep and searching your and praying like like David Touch My Heart Lord there be anything that is not wor please cleanse me Lord let us use that opportunity so we have a grand opportunity today Mar you we don't know when our Lord Jesus Christ is coming but all of us we should say even if he comes today I can boldly say come Lord come come can you say that [Music] hallelujah hallelujah let every Christian say that opportunity is there for you and for me no matter how you had strayed away come back to the say I'm coming back coming home never more I have forsaken everything Lord take my hand Lord Hold My Hand Me Lord the life that I I'm now to live me through Lord I'm here before you Lord I'm your child hallelujah hallelujah may God bless you [Applause] [Applause] youate we've been so much blessed to lunch deeper praise the name of our Lord L deeper and the deeper go the S it becomes praise the name of our Lord the deeper you go the more you become like God in the message questions and answers I think it was of 1964 they were asking brother Bram actually let me just get that praise the name of our Lord in the message questions answer of 196 before they were asking brother Bram how can a Christian get deeper in the love of God and then brother Bram answered read the word and pray read the word of God and pray praise the name of our Lord the same thing which Peter also says when you go to the book of Acts I think isap 6s chapter 6 and then and then the Bible says in verse excuse me Acts chapter 6 and verse 4 he says but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word praise the name of our Lord and these are the sacred trust that God has given unto us that as you've believed the word continue reading the word continue meditating upon the continue obeying the word and continue praying you will get deeper and deeper in the Lord praise the name over and then you'll see that all your challenges keep on going away all those demons keep on going away all those bad spirits keep on going our way all bitterness keeps on going our way all any form of thing contrary to God completely disappear from your life praise the name of our and brother has been saying you know when we say we are believers we are called to be obedient to the word of God praise the name of our Lord like if you talking about the thief on the cross when he heard at the last moment he obeyed had opportunity to live longer than that day he died he would have gone into water baptism he would have gone into foot washing would have gone into communion so there is no reason for any of us who has accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal savior to avoid foot washing and the Lord supper otherwise you are playing to be a hypocrite praise the name of our Lord you're not walking straight with God because if you're walking straight with God challenge in your life you seek to rectify there and then praise the name of Lord and this is the life we have been called this morning to we need to live a consecrated life that should be our continu work as children of God praise the name of Lord let us sing one song Let Us stand up and sing one song and then we can each of us pray praise the name of our there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from immanuel's way unseen as PL be the flood Lo oh their [Music] guil loose all their [Music] guilt loose all their guil stay Hallelujah and see in US PL be the FL loose all their guil is the
