name of our Lord Jesus Christ again thank you this afternoon again in your presence they shall be told of the Lord shall be their peace establish our marriages father make us walk and live in the way of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let us turn to Ephesians chapter five Ephesians chapter 5. we read from verse 28 up to verse 33. some of them the scripture says so ought to men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself foreign foreign for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this course shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and the two they too shall be one flesh or Montage this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband I want to preach on the subject reflecting Christ in our marriage oh reflecting Christ in our marriage praise the name of our Lord now we know that in the scriptures marriage was started by God himself when you read in Genesis it is God who said that's not good for a man to be alone and when God say it's not good for a man to be alone God himself said I'll make him a hell of meat God himself testified it is not good for a man to be alone and then he said I will make him a help mate and here we yeah each of us sowed to be in marriage and by the grace of God you got into the marriage I believe not none of us was forced into the marriage I believe none of us was much made it is because there are some places where they might make sure now this one here you go with this we don't believe in that first week is you may have a desire that I wish this brother would go with this sister I wish this sister would accept that brother you wait Just Praise the name you know like there are some scenarios that happened and then you know you see somebody is trying to spend time with somebody who is you may not help at all wow then you start wondering how I wish you're just going to go to the other one you take the other one don't do that even for your children you can't do that praise the name of Allah so I believe none of us was put into that square where you had no option so take it is the choice of Adam was made for him you know it's God who brought the womb the wounds and then he brought the woman to the man and then the man recognized that this is now Flesh of My Flesh and then he took her to be his wife so now God recognized the need of marriage of foreign [Music] and then God created him a likeness and that's what our marriage should be I don't know your likeness praise the name of our Lord you marry somebody that you love and so now as you know love is the foundation of marriage that love should continue in our marriage don't allow illustration to come and take away love from your marriage maybe issues of poverty maybe issues of sickness maybe issues of barrenness you know but you should not allow anything away your love for your husband or for your wife much as possible now if you get into a situation where you don't love one another then that that you know you are hardening your heart against your husband you are hardening your heart against your wife and this one should not be because you married somebody who is part of you now the scripture has told us Ephesians chapter 5 verse 28. so old men to love their wives as their own bodies you know the way you love your body if you fall sick the way you try to rush to the hospital that is the same feeling that should be extended so then you should love your your wife also this is what the Lord wants us to do and when you love your wife you are doing things according to the word of God then you are reflecting Christ in your marriage until if maybe you are in the neighborhood oh maybe you know like music is where people know what has happened to the others what you ate last night whether how many shots you have you know they can know that this man has only one shot this one here the shoes are worn out but again they can just know everything about it so now if you have Christ in your marriage then the neighborhood will know I wish my husband was like that I wish my wife was like they are saying in Christ in your marriage they are seeing the love you have for one another they are seeing the kindness you have foreign with six with six things that you know unite us then what divide us praise the name of our Lord don't look for things that divide you don't look for things that you know will hurt the other person but you are careful again if you hurt the other feel sorry about it seek for forgiveness please forgive me please I didn't do to this kind of thing I didn't intend to do this kind of things you know you you are kind of avoiding having a hard heart you know you don't want to have a Stony heart against your husband or your wife but you are kind and then the Bible tells us let us go to First Peter chapter three yeah praise the name of our Lord First Peter chapter 3 verse 8. the Bible says finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous foreign [Music] that's when you need it and then he says love as Brethren be pitiful pitiful in other words amen you you are trying to stand with one another you know you are concerned about their situation you are standing with your companion you are standing with your wife who are standing with your husband you know you are standing together even in that situation which is not pleasant praise the name of our Lord you are standing together like I remember the former president of the USA you know that was the Mr Clinton and now he had some kind of Scandal which was there no something wrong he had done and now these people of the Republican you know of course everybody wants to pull the other one down so now they brought the Monica lewinsking that you know when she was working in this White House Clinton did something wrong with her white house but you know the wife of the president stood with her husband yet that act I think would have hurt more than any other person but she stood with her husband even when when the husband did was shameful was something that was demeaning her but she stood with her husband and then and the until now they are still standing together when they left the white house so the Bible tells us to be pitiful you are showing kindness to one another even in their weaknesses even in their failures praise the name of Allah and you see if you don't show kindness if you don't show compassion you know if you were not really as a person who is of support to your husband or your wife then you are opening room for the devil to get in your midis and then you find that everybody starts being living in a life of isolation he doesn't and then you know if anything small like this happens your imaginations becomes wrong and then you start thinking you know something which happened at some time you didn't show kindness you didn't show compassion you're not concerned about the other person's state of Hawaii so if something now happens then a complex keeps on growing together and then you find that somebody who never had the hypertension pressure somebody else because all these things can come from those kind of misunderstandings you don't have peace you are traveled you can't sleep then for you I've traveled about this but you understand [Music] this one doesn't care but at night you're meant to sleep I foreign confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry it is a foremost question in believer's heart foreign [Music] [Music] now if the beginning of sin started in an area of marriage then how about now so then you see that the devil has still interest in the marriage and then he makes sure that the husband and the wife they cannot you know move as one so the devil will ensure that he creates differences in the marriage maybe something comes up here maybe it is a trial maybe it is a scene you know maybe it is a problem and the devil is trying to get along there and you know sometimes somebody can react in a way which is not appropriate to the other um and then now this one takes it as an offense amazing and then he holds a grudge and remember when it comes to eat supper if the wife has prepared the meal I'm satisfied now that goes to what happened oh if now the husband comes to eat the food and maybe the food is not well prepared maybe she's punishing me over the other thing and then you hold that thing in your heart and then you go to sleep your heart is not free to converse you wake up in the morning the whole day you are traveling that place or sometimes there is no problem you have left at home but at home you had to travel at work you had troubles now when you come home you are not behaving they used to behave every other day children want to play with you you are just sending them away how has been your day and the wife starts wondering then start thinking maybe the other day what I did was wrong maybe the house is not clean enough you know the devil will always try to get in any place bring Conflict at home now for you who stay at places of work and their troubles before you reach home pray that you get on with the right mode you say Lord let the Troubles of works let my troubles at work and let me have peace at home but now you are Carrying Your Troubles from work again you are bringing them home maybe the day has been a bad business day like now maybe brother the clients have not come the whole world and they want school fees for their children so you don't transfer that stress stress say praise the name of it sometimes maybe you expect it to be paid allowances and then there is no allowance but masala what do you do you transfer that pressure on your wife or your husband or what do you do follow it just take it to the Lord in prayers we just need to learn how to live foreign you know [Music] you know like to give somebody support you know he said I'll make him a helip meat um when you need help when you're failing in some of this when you can't easily go ahead you feel you cannot make it without the other s should be our lives you know I can't live without my wife I can't live without myself and be always concerned praise the name of Allah you know there are some families which is very unfortunate a woman they are working and they transfer come says please human resource transform it to the other place they find that their troubles at home but that's not that should not be what a marriage is how are you going to be a help me to the others so you find that there is wow each of us individually you should contribute the cause of the travel at home that's what the Lord wants us to do praise the name of Allah you shouldn't be the cause seek for forgiveness praise the name of our Lord you feel like you are the person to take the burden you know the person to take the pain but you don't be the person to inflict the pain but you take the pain upon yourself that's the true love of God that is the true attitude of the believer I just want to read it somewhere here as a true Christian to praise the name of our Lord you are allowed to take the pain you allowed to take and give the best offer wow now in the message Hebrews chapter 7 says in paragraph 49. Abraham Ibrahim he didn't fast with lots it goes beyond being brethren we are husband and wife you know we are one then he said we must not foreign you know maybe when they are reporting their case when the wife is just talking like this husband comes back immediately when the wife is talking um nobody can give room to the other children that should not be like that praise the name of Allah we must not add you but lift up your head and go anywhere anywhere you want to go if you go east that is the Christian attitude foreign foreign praise the name of Allah and you know these are things that God wants us to practice let it let it put in your life let it work out in your marriage but then don't get counselors you know if you do like that you know it's not the way we take our Council take the pain that's a true Christian attitude you is causing the pain don't make it a happy day you know there are those who want to exploit that line when they know this is where my wife's weakness is where my husband's weakness then they want to exploit that weakness instead of standing to support that should not be in our marriages that should not be in our family praise the name of Allah we need to reflect Christina foreign dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife us and to the weaker vessel and as being heard together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered much is amen Amina let us continue with the Colossians chapter 3 verse 19 then we shall get back to that scripture does that from us 18. he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord 18 18. collusions that's what the Bible says as wives you submit then as husbands you love praise the name of Allah let us not allow the the modern things I'm a fellow human beings [Music] against your spouse foreign and you know the root of bitterness you know we'll come and destroy everything so we need to have that genuine love in our hearts and don't allow bitterness against your wife even before she has done something wrong be [Music] let us go and look at Ephesians and then verse 29. he says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers oh foreign and then we read word by word he says let all bitterness bitterness overcome with what is it saying you maintain the same bitterness and you know it is your wife it is your husband don't have bitterness regardless of what they have done foreign he says let all bitterness [Music] and the clama and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice no now you see each of these is a different Spirit but only one can bring all the others so you need to that you don't have any of that thing in your heart and you can never have bitterness and you said the Holy Ghost still there in the house because these things grieve the holy spirit so they grieve the Holy Spirit and then you see that you are in a condition of a kind of person everything you're going to handle is even the way you are going to to look what your wife will be like hey this man wants to kill me or what you're joking maybe the way you're going to look at your husband said I've never seen my wife like that I'm even fearing to go back home foreign [Music] praise the name of our Lord you may hurt one another and may be hard for you to reconciles so you need to take that this is my wife so you know this is my husband let me stand with him let me stand with her and you know when you show kindness when somebody has done something right you will be able to win that Soul praise the name of it or if you have hurt one another you is tenderhearted you who is a true Christian please I'm sorry please I'm sorry you don't say that it's his fault if that person come to me foreign [Music] you're not helping this relationship pray for him and if you have trusted people not you know there are some people you tell them something maybe to pray for you but to pray for you they are going to tell everybody oh we need to pray for them I pray is that you know you are just trying to paint you know broadcasting the whole thing will come out everybody is asking them people are coming together again maybe they are pretending yeah you know but there are some people I don't know why they would want to speak even about others any person is them that is hot news how would you feel about it foreign foreign dwell with them according to knowledge giving Honda unto their wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered much foreign [Music] [Music] foreign because the Lord has been witness between the and the wife of the youth against whom though has dealt treacherously yet she is thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant foreign foreign the wife of your youth like Dan is a youth Grace is the use and anything about Grace now is the name of Allah the wife of his youth the love Grace then it doesn't mind if you abuse him or you do what then yet he has a Grace praise the name and the good thing she's Grace he has Grace and Grace Grace now God says I have been a witness praise the name of Allah a witness from the time Dan first called Grace hello [Music] we are seeking favor he was a witness then he was waiting she said don't call me again I've been waiting for your call wait a minute why are we going to meet then the next one can we go and eat food together and everybody is foreign [Music] then God says he's a what a witness and then they tell you you're going to bring this bring this and you know the Bible says when the lab and told Jacob work for her for seven years the Bible says Jacob worked as if the days were too short because of the love he had foreign have foreign [Music] something went wrong but the good thing is you can still revive it is you can still love your wife you can still move together so he says why are you dealing with her Treasures God doesn't want us to deal with one another yeah [Music] when you go to a police officer he says I'm going to deal with you you try to look for a time to run away so he says don't deal with your wife but dwell with her yeah and a good example you know in many of our characters and so even when you have you prepared the place for it maybe it is laying eggs and then maybe when you go to check on the eggs and then you get a snake there was a you can't sleep what do you do with that snake you deal with it by killing it so you don't deal with your wife you don't deal with your husband he will see him he's playing with me that's not for your wife that's not for your husband and that shouldn't be no that should not be for your children let us dwell with one another cherish she ended care fire support praise the name of Allah don't start thinking ah maybe if I wish I had a wife like the other one or a husband like the other one God has given you the best whatever challenges you're going through just ask God to give you the grace learn to live together forgiving one another being kind to one another caring foreign that's what Christ wants in our family and then
