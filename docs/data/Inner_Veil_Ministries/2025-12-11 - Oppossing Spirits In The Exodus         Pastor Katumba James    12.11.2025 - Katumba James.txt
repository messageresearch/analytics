And Lord, we believe you are here, Lord. And you also promised in your word, and they shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be their peace. If they may come and take to us, Father, show us the path that we have to take, Lord. meet all the needs we have into your hands. Give your grace to come down in our lives for sister Alis together her family over the passing on of their brother. Lord you may give them comfort and strength. Comfort that whole family in the name of Jesus. We also pray for our sister Barbara. also give comfort together with the children over the passing on of their beloved one. Lord, we pray that your grace may abide in all this. Also bless us now in the name of the Lord Jesus who pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us turn to our Bibles. &gt;&gt; We're reading in the book of Numbers chapter 16. Numbers chapter 16 and then we're reading from verse one. The Bible says &gt;&gt; now Kora the son of Isa the son of Kohath the son of Levi and Dathan and Abraham the sons of Elab and On the son of Palace sons of Robin took took men. And they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel, 250 princes of the assembly, famous in the congre Congregation, men of renown. and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them, "You take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord. May God bless of his word. You may be seated. We want to share on the opposing spirits in the Exodus. Praise the name of our Lord. Opposing spirits in the Exodus. Now you see that the Lord was taking the children of Israel from Egypt to the promised land. And the Lord had chosen Moses to be able to handle this this kind of Exodus. And Moses was proved among the children of Israel that he has been chosen of God with infallible signs and wonders. And then even whatever Moses was speaking was coming to pass. Praise the name of the Lord. Not once, not twice, but several times. The children of Israel were entirely depending upon Moses to lead them. Now, Moses would bring the voice of God in their midst. They had the pillar of fire. And then the pillar of fire would become a cloud during the time and you know it was leading them you know guiding them in the Exodus. And now when they kept on moving every challenge that they had crying to Moses and then Moses would cry to God respond and you know it kept on like that continuously and you know we are also in an exodus. Praise the name of our Lord. The third exodus. Praise the name of our Lord. In the message the third exodus, brother Brham says we are in an exodus and living and turning the tapes off in a moment. All my friends, my brothers, &gt;&gt; both present and that will hear the tapes as your brother and citizen of the kingdom of God. Come out in this Exodus. come out in this exodus. For all that is left behind will bear the mark of the beast. Come out of Babylon. Come out of this confusion. Come out of these systems and serve the living God. says we are in an exodus. A call to come from denominations from all these denominations you know says come out of those denominations religions has got two parts which is coming out and then entering in. So now when he takes us out, when he takes us out, &gt;&gt; then he puts us inside. He took them out of Egypt and then he placed them in the promised land. So even as he takes out of confusion of religion and then he and then he puts us into the body of Christ, baptized into the body of Jesus Christ. Praise the name of Then he says this great angel of the covenant. Jesus Christ in the form of God thought it not but became equal with God. Now he is the pillar of fire in the same form that he was back there bringing the first Exodus bringing the second exodus and is here with the third exodus you see that in the first Exodus pillar of fire they had a mighty prophet in their midst the mighty prophet He was guiding them. He was leading them. And then now we see here it says that the first Exodus what did he do? He brought them out of a natural land that is Egypt to a natural land that is Israel the promised land. Then the second exodus, he brought them out of a spiritual condition that was during the time of our Lord Jesus Christ when he was here on earth. So he took them from a spiritual condition. You know the laws of Moses, the Jewish traditions, you know what they had like you know following the Sadducees, the Pharisees 16 where they were sacrificing animals where they had a form of worship. God was picking them out from that condition, from a spiritual condition into the spiritual baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now, you notice that in the first Exodus, they had a promise. They had where they were looking forward and the promise was to go back to the promised land, which is Canon. Then in the first second exodus there was also a promise and the promise was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which they received on the day of Pentecost. Now we are in the third exodus and the promise of our day is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the promise of the day change of our bodies. Praise the name of our Lord. The promise we have today, change of our bodies from this motor body, this mortal body that is our target. Praise the name of our climax. You know the change of our bodies, our full redemption because our full redemption comes when these bodies can no longer die. When these bodies can no longer fall sick, when these bodies can no longer, you know, grow old. That's the promise that we have. Second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ will come. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says I show you a mystery. We shall all not sleep. So the promise of our day. Praise the name of our target. That's the promise we have. And then you can't get INTO THE CHANGE OF YOUR BODY. You are not born again. You are not baptized with the Holy Spirit. He's not stopping at the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Praise the name of our go beyond that. And that COMES BY THE SPIRIT HIMSELF. You are born by the spirit. You grow by the spirit. You are adopted by the spirit. And you know adoption. The Bible says in re in Romans chapter 8, praise the name of our Lord. Romans chapter 8 and then verse 23. We can start from verse 21. It says, "Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travails in pain together until now. And not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the redemption of our bodies. That is the promise we have before us, our target, our climax. Praise the name over there. So we are in the third Exodus. So we go back to that message, the third Exodus and then paragraph 301. And he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the eternal land of the millennium and the great here after same pillar of fire by the same anointed The same God doing the same things. And the same word declares the first one declare the second one. The same word declared the second one has declared the third one. And here we see it among us. Come out of this chaos. Come to the living God. Come to the word. Praise the name of our Lord. We are in the third exodus. And now as we are in the third exodus, they are also opposing spirits that hinder us or are fighting us. going forth the children. Praise the name of our Lord. We see here that in the time of Moses that there were men of renown. There were men of renown. There were men of renown war. the Koras, &gt;&gt; the Dan, &gt;&gt; the Abberam, &gt;&gt; they were renown among the congregation. And now when they reached along the journey, they never had a clear vision of what the Exodus is about. And then they tell Moses, "Why do you take it upon yourself too much?" You know we are holy. We are also anointed where the promised land is. You know they started opposing Moses. Praise the name of our Lord. You know it's just the same thing like when you look at the natural governments like the different governments if you start seeing that this leader is not worthy or you start saying this leader is not worthy and you start doing things contrary to the leadership. They say it is prayer zone. And so we see Abraham &gt;&gt; resisting the leadership of Moses. They wanted to take over. So now in verse 12, Moses goes and tells them, "You bring them sons of which said we will not come up. Now you can imagine they rejected the leadership of Moses. Said we don't care what you're doing. We are not going to obey you. We are not going to hear what you're going to say. Opposing spirit. And then verse 13 It is a small thing that thou has brought us up out of the land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us. Now you see they are preaching now telling him where we are from Egypt it's better than where we are you promising take us you know where we are from is enter opposing verse 14. &gt;&gt; Moreover, thou hast not brought us into the land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards, wo put out the eyes of these men, we will not come up. Praise the name of our Lord. They opposed Moses. They resisted Moses. And we have the same spirits now that can come amongst us and say let us go back to the denomination. The message there is nothing good making you look back. You know the spirit of flowies makes people to look back the denomination going back to what you've been in and you know convincing the people turning the people against you. And so even now any form of spirit that makes you put the message aside or makes you praise the name of reject the authority of the messenger in an age like Kora and they were actually resisting ing the authority of Moses. They were questioning the authority of Moses. Jesus will always be there in any Exodus. They were there during the time of Moses questioning the authority of Moses. People not obey what Moses was telling. In the time of Jesus Christ, the spirits were there questioning the authority of Jesus Christ. The Pharisees came to Jesus Christ and then told him by what authority do you do those miracles? Not that they wanted to believe. No, because they rejected him. And when Jesus told them the baptism of John, was it of men or of God? You see the politics that they played? They went aside from the people and then they started discussing. If we tell him, the baptism of John was of men. the people will will throw stones at us because the people knew that John was a prophet and they said but if we tell him that the bapt of John was of God he's going to ask us why didn't you believe John when John was there they sent people they came to him &gt;&gt; and asked him who are you questioning the authority of the messenger. So were questioning the authority of Moses. The Pharisees were questioning the authority of John the Baptist. They were questioning the authority of Jesus Christ. So even in this third exodus, spirits rise up to question the authority of brother Brana, you know, to make you doubt the messenger. Don't hear him. There are other people. We had a prophet the other side messenger. We have this kind of thing. Opposing spirits. Praise the name of Lord. They come to question to make sure that you doubt your faith. And that's what the devil did at the beginning in Genesis chapter 3. The serpent came to Eve. to question the authority of God, you know, to kind of like resist to question is that to doubt to make sure that you doubt your decision making like you know these people who stud the people They tell you a manipulator. They when they come to you, they come to make you doubt your decision making. You doubt your right decision. They manipulate you and put you in a condition where you are you you are confused and like now they meet you at Gaddafi roundabout and then you've already taken over. You're almost reaching the crossing of the railway. Then they tell you you don't even know the way which goes to town. Then you try to look back, they confuse you there and if you hear them, they'll end up taking you away. That's what the serpent was doing. The serpent came to Eve and said, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field, which the Lord had made, and he said unto the woman, yeah, has God said, you shall not eat of every tree of the garden? So they question you. They put you into a state of doubting what you know. Like they can come and tell you were you there when they were revealing the seven seals. Opposing spirits like now they come and ask us can you show me in the Bible? Now when you tell them that okay John the Baptist was talked about was spoken of in the Bible in the old testament but in the his name is there in the Bible what about this one they come to see AND THEY SAW DOUBT IN YOUR soul that's what the devil does all the time this is what do and they were doing. Don't receive what he's telling you. You know, trying to tell you that what you have is not worth. So, we need to be convinced. We need to be convinced. The message that we have received is of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now if you have doubt in your mind, you'll be taken up by those spirits. Praise the name of our Lord. That's why it is important to know. Praise the name of our Lord. Message that we have got. Praise the name of our Lord. Doubt in your mind. Don't hear somebody to come and tell you and confuse you. And now some people they may end up going to internet but Google has every funny thing which is there but we have the message books which are completely not edited but it is exactly the voice of God. Take time and read things about the messenger. Praise the name of Lord. Now, if you don't know about the messenger, then somebody will confuse you. Somebody will come up with something and then you'll end up following that. Praise the name of our Lord. So, they were blackmailing Moses. They were blackmailing Jesus. Even now they blackmail the prophet. Satan that is his business. He will do all he can do to discredit what you believe. If you don't have faith in what you have and now when you doubt what you have then your protection is taken away. That's what the devil does. That's what the devil did to Eve. Brother Brham said the devil attacked the word and the word is our protection. So now when you lose faith in the word then you have lost confidence in your protection. You know you feel like you can't overcome by what you have. So now the Bible tells us that false prophets and false Christ shall come. And we are living in the days of false prophets and false Christ. Their coming is not in vain. They achieve what they are up to. Let us go to M chapter 24. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible says in verse 11, "And there many false prophets shall rise and deceive many. They are not their coming is not in vain. So you must be guarded. How will you tell this is a false prophet or this is not a false prophet? You must test by the word of God. Praise the name of God. So the Bible says they shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall works called. So when the false prophets come, the level of iniquity, the amount of iniquity increases. That's what they do. They make sure that iniquity continues on. Even somebody who do repent, they refuse I think I'm see I'm seeing an error in him. &gt;&gt; He has a mistake. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil does. &gt;&gt; He makes sure that he casts doubt on what you have. So he says that many their love shall works cold their first love for God. Now you look at your condition. What is your zeal to read the message of the hour? Praise the name of. If we said how many have taken time to read the message this week, you find you are challenged. Maybe other than hearing it in church. Every morning we have a morning exaltation. Now if you ask somebody what church age are we on? I think we are still on then you know that one had about 6 months ago. They don't know what's going on. you know too busy you know that there is no time for God and these are the days we are living in you know so many things have taken our attention until we are failing to do what we are meant to do you find you are too busy you can't sit down for 30 means and listen attentively exaltations that we have. You don't have that time. You know you you find yourself you are involved in so many affairs of life. So you get yourself you're used to doing things which are wrong. And then the Bible says iniquity shall abound. And when iniquity abounds when iniquity increases, the love just goes down. No more time to pray. No more time to testify about the Lord. That's the condition we are living in. Those are all opposing spirits to fail you to reach your adoption. Until you doubt, you are afraid. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what to do. You are troubled like the rest of the world because the love of God has waxed cold. Praise the name of the Lord. But then the Bible says in verse 13, "But he that endures unto the end, the same shall be saved. That means that the stration that are coming to challenge users, false prophets will come the you know people who are contrary will come able to endure. Will you be able to overcome them? Will you be able to detect them? The Bible says even now the spirit of antichrist works. It has already come out. It's already in the world. Praise the name of our Lord. Now in this in the in the book of first John chapter 4, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. The Bible says, "Try the spirits." You've heard something. Is it correct? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Lord. Then the Bible says the false prophets have gone out and now they want you to lose focus. They want you to lose confidence in the message. They want you to lose confidence in the messenger. You know, you start doubting what you've heard. You start doubting the messenger. You start ignoring what the messenger says then you start coming having that kind of imagination in the denominational world. You mean if I'm not baptized I will go to hell? That's what they do. Then you also take it lightly. You mean if I'm a woman and I put on clothes, you know, God can feel bad. You know you despise what you stand for and then you take the way of you know anything that is contrary to the word of God is anti is antichrist. So the Bible says in verse two, &gt;&gt; hereby know the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist whereof you've heard that it should come and even now already is in the world. Praise the name of the Lord. Antichrist is around you know opposing spirit. Then he says in the Lician church age page 329. The second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven church ages. The second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven church ages started with the antichrist spirit as well as the holy spirit who is the blessed forever. 1 John 4:1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Did you notice it? The antichrist spirit is identified with the false prophets. Praise the name of Allah. False prophet will tell you something against the word. You lose faith in the word. and the false prophet had the same spirit as the antichrist. The ages came in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets. Now, of course, there is going to be a real false prophet in the grand sense of that man. mentioned in Revelation. But as of now before his revelation there appear many false prophets in Mark chapter 24 and then verse 23. He says, &gt;&gt; "Then if any man shall say unto you, lo here is Christ, believe it not." Praise the name of our Lord. Is here. Oh, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU can be delivered. Is the only place you can be delivered. Says, "Don't believe it. For there shall arise false Christ, false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, they will deceive the very elect, behold, I have told you, wherefore, if they shall say unto you, He is in the desert. Go not forth. Behold, he is in the secret chambers. Believe it not. It's a warning that we have now. Praise the name of God. Now, in the message, the third Exodus, you look what the impact of opposing spirits paragraph 306 in the message that Exodus in the days of the coming out of Israel out of two and a half million people. Only two made the land opposing spirits. The Bible says they shall deceive very many. They entice. They obstruct. They make you lose your focus until you don't get the clear vision of Jesus Christ. In the days of Jesus Christ, there was about 120 that made it. But how many people had the ministry of Jesus? How many were healed in the days of Jesus? Only 120 were able to obey the voice and go and wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit. Then he says, "And now in the days of the ending of the world, straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, but few there will be that will find it. But broad is the way that leads to destruction. How many will go in? The words cannot fail. See the time we are living in. How many people call themselves born again? The churches that we have, how many are standing by the truth. Praise the name of our Lord. any one of them of the many who claim count yourself that among the few that the Lord is coming. Praise the name of Lord. We are living in the challenging time. There are many spirits that have come out and they come out in different forms. Praise the name of our Lord. They can come out to move along, you know, moving along the group. There the Bible says in the book of Exodus, in the book of Exodus, let us speak it here. Exodus 12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Circus about 600,000 foot on foot that were made beside the children. And then in the verse 38 he says and a mixed multitude went up also with them and the flocks and the hearts even very much cattle. Now the Bible says a mixed multitude. You know many people maybe they heard about Moses. They were RUNNING AND SAYING AH WE SURVIVED the the the deadly things in Egypt. Let us go with this mighty prophet. Let the water become blood darkness for a number of days multitude. All going different attitudes, different intentions, just a mixed multitude. And that mixed multitude became a problem in the wilderness, complaining all the time, complain over this, there's no water, there's no food, oh, there's no this, there's no this. all the time complaining from the time I left domination I have problems or you get many troubles I don't know why maybe I look cast my friends have left me never knew the ways of God they despise the way of the Lord in Absap 11:6 verse one. The Bible says, "And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord, and the Lord had it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. and the people cried unto Moses. And when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched. And he called the name of the place because the fire of the Lord burnt among them. And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lasting. And the children of Israel also wept again and said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic. And now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all beside this manner before our eyes. I don't know. You know, they were mixed multitude. They never had a clear revelation of the Exodus. complaining about this, complaining about complaining about complaining about this. They never had faith in God, not depending on God at all. They had an excuse. When this one comes another thing, another thing and the devil can put the same spirits upon it. But you know, for you, you are all the time complaining. You are not contented. You know, you despise the path that the Lord has brought you into. Go back to the things where you are under bondage. Spirits that oppose our exodus. Praise the name of Lord. So we need to see that we overcome all these spirits by being obedient to the word of the Lord and waiting on the Lord. You know, you wait on the Lord. You've heard the promises of the Lord and then wait on the Lord. Praise the name of Lord. And you see the devil would always want us to despise you know the things of God. That's what the devil systematically likes doing. You know when God told Moses the 12 spies to the land of promise and now when they went to the land of promise they came back with the first fruits. They had an evidence of the land. They came with the fruit. They came with everything. And then they were carrying them before the congregation. They had a testimony that the land is surely there. But then the devil made them look at the sons of Anna. Those are giants. Oh, they are giants. We are like grasshoppers. We cannot go and overcome them opposing their exodus until they made the whole congregation cry and they wanted to stone Moses. And then they said, "Let us go back to Egypt." Spirits that oppose You cannot live an upright life. This this generation is so spoiled. How can you be a young girl without a boyfriend? How can you be a man without a girlfriend? How can you say you are married to only one woman? You know, you need to have somebody else around. There are so many opposing spirits. You spend a lot of time going to church for us. We only pray for 5 minutes and you follow you. That's why you're going to become poor and then you start looking at your condition. I have this trouble even house rent. My friend must have said something true. Then you start giving lectures of coming to church. I was online whether you're online or not. You know the devil telling you the land is having giants you can't manage. You know for you in this life praise the name of you know there are many challenges that keep on coming like I remember when I was going to Toro &gt;&gt; about I think 20 years ago my friend was working here in Ginger he was a senior officer then he called me to his office and then he told me you know you're went to local government and the things of local government. I didn't understand it. You see the office in I protect. So he said but there is a good powerful which doctor I can take you to helping me. So they have many traditions everywhere and then now you also here and then you go there then one time we had planted I think a lot of acorage for ginats. And then our harvest was very poor. I think it was maze. One man came with a machine which th how many acres did you plant from? We told him I said what you've got from 10 acres I only get it from one acre. I ask him how. He said, "I have rain makers. They just come to the garden and do their things and it rains." Or maybe they come and stop raining like that. Nothing is hurt, giants in the land. The world does the way it does their things. But you're not going to do like that for you. Why aren't you getting a promotion? You know, the other wanted me to do something funny. If you don't do that, you'll just die on that level. So many things the devil has put around frustrate your progress. But you know the Bible says greater is he that is in us than the devil that's in the world. You stand faithful to the word. Stand faithful to the message of the earth. And don't allow any situation to draw you away from following what the Lord has given unto us. Praise the name of God. Don't allow to hear the false prophet. Don't allow to hear the talk of the sons of Anarch. Then don't allow to hear doras to despise the message that we've been given. Praise the name of our Lord. Even the balams will come to do the same signs like Moses. the same signs like Malachi 4. But Malachi 4 had the voice behind the signs of these people. They can do signs but the voice of God behind. Praise the name of our Lord. We need to stay with the message. Praise the name of our Lord. I have to stop here. May God bless you. Amen. [applause] Let us sing this song which says when the savior calls me as we go to pray praise the name of our lord. On Saturday we have praying and fasting. Then on Sunday we have two services. The morning services for all of us, but then the afternoon services for the youth who are in school. Praise the name of the Lord. God bless you. When the Savior calls, I will answer.
