[26:33] &gt;&gt; So the things that you don't see
[26:36] because the the roots you never see.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, Satan can work
[26:45] on all that you see,
[26:48] but he cannot work on things that you
[26:50] don't see.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; There's our secret.
[26:57] The things that he he was and Jesus was
[26:59] called
[27:01] the root
[27:03] and the offspring of David.
[27:06] Not only the offspring,
[27:08] &gt;&gt; but he would also call the root of
[27:10] David.
[27:14] Amen. Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; And we are not going back. We are going
[27:18] back
[27:19] &gt;&gt; to our where we come from.
[27:22] Hallelujah.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Back to the roots.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then book of Acts. Quickly
[27:29] open.
[27:31] Book of Acts.
[27:32] Acts chapter 2.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Very familiar scripture.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:40] Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; And if we would have continued with Jo,
[27:46] &gt;&gt; we would have read where he said, "And I
[27:49] will and I will pour out my spirit upon
[27:51] all flesh."
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know Joel,
[27:57] but you know Joel is speaking of very
[27:59] interesting
[28:01] as he spoke about I will restore.
[28:05] He spoke about this time
[28:08] and when he said I will pour out my
[28:09] spirit upon all flesh
[28:12] then he put also the time of Pentecost.
[28:17] So we really have to read the scripture
[28:21] how it is wrote
[28:24] and sometimes it jumps
[28:27] sometimes one scripture
[28:30] covers thousands of years.
[28:35] Is that right? In the beginning God
[28:38] created
[28:42] the prophet said that can be have can be
[28:45] a million years.
[28:48] that one sense. Amen that that one
[28:51] sentence
[28:53] in the beginning. So we want to be very
[28:56] attentive.
[28:58] Amen. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Acts chapter 2. And when the day
[29:02] of Pentecost was fully come, they were
[29:04] all with one accord in one place.
[29:12] And suddenly there came a sound from
[29:14] heaven as a of a rushing mighty wind and
[29:17] it filled all the house where they were
[29:18] sitting.
[29:29] Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Then we go to verse 12 because
[29:34] of time reasons.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; And they were all amazed
[29:39] and were in doubt, saying one to the
[29:42] other, "What meanest this?"
[29:55] &gt;&gt; You get that? So because there was they
[29:59] spoke in unknown tongues
[30:02] you know the story on the day of
[30:03] Pentecost.
[30:05] So and when they looked at it from
[30:07] outside
[30:09] they said what is this? What mean is
[30:13] this
[30:14] they saw a manifestation?
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't
[30:23] they couldn't place it.
[30:29] Watch very carefully.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Others mocking said, "These men are full
[30:36] of new wine."
[30:44] So people was there and they looked to
[30:46] the manifestation
[30:49] and they say, "Oh, they have maybe
[30:52] drunken too much.
[30:54] No.
[30:56] But Peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[31:00] up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men
[31:03] of Judea and all that dwell at
[31:05] Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[31:08] hearken to my words.
[31:25] And I I just like that how Peter was
[31:27] answering.
[31:30] He was answering very normal.
[31:33] He said, "These are not drunken as he
[31:36] supposed
[31:38] but the third hour of the day."
[31:47] Amen. Amen.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; So Peter said, "No, no, they cannot be
[31:50] drunk
[31:52] because at this time of the day,
[31:54] nobody is drunk."
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Look how Peter is answering.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Down to earth.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; But this is that which was spoken by the
[32:14] prophet Joel.
[32:20] Hallelujah.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Peter looked
[32:24] &gt;&gt; and Peter said, "No,
[32:26] &gt;&gt; this
[32:28] &gt;&gt; is that
[32:32] and I want to preach this afternoon
[32:36] on
[32:38] is this that
[32:48] Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Because we know the promise.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; We have read the promise.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; And I want to ask the question
[33:01] is this
[33:03] that
[33:06] let us pray together.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[33:10] &gt;&gt; thank you again for your grace and for
[33:11] your mercy.
[33:13] Thank you that all that you have done.
[33:16] Oh God, now we pray that you take again
[33:20] control. I I surrender myself totally to
[33:26] Lord inspire me. I pray lead me and
[33:30] guide me.
[33:32] I have my notes. I have written down. I
[33:34] have I have prayed. I have done what I
[33:36] could do.
[33:39] Father, now you do what I cannot do.
[33:43] We because for this purpose we commit
[33:45] ourselves into
[33:47] have thine own way I pray.
[33:49] Answer the prayers of your people.
[33:52] Oh father I pray each and everyone walk
[33:55] out from here.
[33:57] Then he can say no no no this is that
[34:01] he is risen from the dead.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; I pray father all to your honor and to
[34:06] your glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless you. You may be
[34:12] seated.
[34:15] [snorts]
[34:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's amazing, isn't it?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; It's amazing that as we have read it
[34:23] and actually what happened in the in the
[34:25] upper room
[34:28] was a promise of Joel.
[34:30] Is that right? We could have read a
[34:33] little for further.
[34:35] And God said, I have I will pour out my
[34:37] spirit upon all things.
[34:41] Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And and now now you understand
[34:46] as it happened
[34:48] there was a great confusion
[34:52] of what this is what is happening.
[34:56] People were somehow confused
[34:59] as we have read. They were amazed.
[35:03] What is this now?
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:06] He said they asked themselves the
[35:09] question,
[35:10] what mean is this?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; So they couldn't they couldn't connect
[35:17] the promise and the fulfillment of the
[35:20] promise. They couldn't connect that and
[35:24] this is our greatest problem. what we
[35:25] know. We know so many things that is
[35:28] promised
[35:30] but so many times we cannot connect the
[35:34] promise to the fulfillment
[35:38] and this is I think what brother Bernham
[35:40] said
[35:42] what man is he said now in in God hiding
[35:45] in simplicity
[35:48] the prophet said now man has their own
[35:50] ideas of what God ought to be and what
[35:53] God is going to do.
[35:58] As I have made the old statement many
[36:00] times
[36:02] that man remains man.
[36:07] Man is always giving God praise for what
[36:10] he did do.
[36:13] And we should do that. We should God
[36:16] give praise for what he did do
[36:19] and always looking forward to what he
[36:21] will do.
[36:24] Amen. Which is not wrong. We should look
[36:28] forward with expectation
[36:30] for what God is going to do.
[36:33] But that's not enough. He said, but
[36:36] ignoring what he is doing right now.
[36:42] The way the people miss it,
[36:44] they look back. Now watch now. Watch
[36:48] very carefully. They look back and see
[36:53] in what great thing God has done things
[36:58] but they fail to see in what simple
[37:01] thing he used to do.
[37:06] Amen. Is it not like this? We look back
[37:11] on what God has done and we see we see
[37:14] what marvelous it was
[37:18] and then we look at our day and we try
[37:21] to see the copy of it.
[37:26] We try to see it repeat.
[37:30] Is it not exactly what we try to see?
[37:33] There's where Pentecost fails.
[37:37] There is where Pentecost failed.
[37:40] They tried to see a repetition
[37:44] constantly
[37:47] and what as they desired a repetition
[37:51] the enemy could come in.
[37:54] Amen.
[37:56] Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; You're with me.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; That is brother I'm said that's a major
[38:00] problem of humanity
[38:03] and then the man is looking forward.
[38:07] Then they look forward to see a great
[38:09] thing coming
[38:12] and it's going to happen.
[38:14] And nine times out of 10,
[38:21] it is already happening
[38:24] right around them.
[38:27] And it is so simple
[38:29] that they miss it, that they don't.
[38:32] So I'm asking you the question today.
[38:36] Is this that
[38:46] &gt;&gt; is this that
[38:48] &gt;&gt; or are we still waiting?
[38:55] &gt;&gt; You are the congregation.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; You are answering.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm only asking the question.
[39:11] Amen.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; It's a good question, right?
[39:21] &gt;&gt; What do you try to see?
[39:25] Now we speak of restoration
[39:28] &gt;&gt; because God said, "I will restore
[39:33] &gt;&gt; all [screaming]
[39:34] the years."
[39:38] Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And I ask you a question.
[39:41] Is it coming
[39:43] &gt;&gt; or is this
[39:45] that?
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:57] Hallelujah.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[40:02] &gt;&gt; You know, don't put it all on the
[40:04] preacher.
[40:07] You are going in the rapture.
[40:10] It is your body change.
[40:12] It is your personal relationship to
[40:14] Jesus Christ.
[40:16] I'm not going in the body change for
[40:18] you.
[40:21] I'm not pulling you in the body chains.
[40:24] I told the people at home in my own
[40:26] church,
[40:28] if the dead in Christ rise
[40:30] and they come to you, don't phone me.
[40:38] Don't phone me.
[40:41] I will not answer the phone
[40:45] because it is your walk.
[40:48] is your personal walk with God
[40:52] because they are coming to you.
[40:55] The dead in Christ are not coming to
[40:58] church.
[41:00] They come to you. They come to you
[41:02] personally.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; So that's why don't bring it all to the
[41:09] preacher.
[41:12] Church, we come to a time
[41:15] and I believe it is necessary.
[41:17] Amen. There's not such a big big
[41:20] distance between the preacher and the
[41:22] congregation.
[41:27] It comes the time when there should not
[41:30] be a two big distance
[41:34] between sheep and shepherd.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; I believe the shepherd
[41:41] should smell like sheep.
[41:47] I believe sheep
[41:49] should smell like shepherds.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Because they are so close.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And I trust that we are living in that
[42:04] hour.
[42:07] Amen. Amen. Because we don't know
[42:10] &gt;&gt; if this wonderful thing what we call
[42:12] church
[42:14] how long it might exist.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; You know under co
[42:21] you you know under the co influence co
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know under co
[42:28] &gt;&gt; how much it disturbed the church life.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Suddenly we were not
[42:35] allowed to go to church.
[42:39] Is that right?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; And many people became very nervous.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; I believe God allowed it.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Just to let you know,
[42:49] &gt;&gt; how close is your relationship?
[42:53] &gt;&gt; To Jesus Christ.
[42:57] Hallelujah.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; As we said, we don't know when the
[43:02] rapture takes place when we are in
[43:04] church.
[43:06] Maybe you are in the kitchen. Maybe you
[43:09] are in bed. Maybe in just you in your
[43:11] duty.
[43:13] Maybe you are mechanic and you're just a
[43:15] new mechanic.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Are we ready? Wherever we
[43:24] are.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we saw this morning, what
[43:32] it means to be ready.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes I was I was once
[43:37] driving in a car
[43:40] &gt;&gt; which was once my job
[43:44] &gt;&gt; a truck driver
[43:47] and as I was driving it in the evening
[43:49] time
[43:56] suddenly I I understood
[44:00] there's somebody sitting next to me in
[44:02] the truck.
[44:06] I just understood there was such a
[44:09] presence in my truck.
[44:13] Somebody was there in the truck and I
[44:16] just started worshiping in the truck.
[44:19] I saw no one.
[44:21] I couldn't feel no one
[44:24] but someone was there.
[44:26] And it was such in an instance
[44:30] it was there. I didn't do any spiritual
[44:33] thing.
[44:34] Amen. I didn't do any spiritual thing. I
[44:38] was just there doing my work
[44:40] and before I realized there was a
[44:43] presence in you.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But as we speak of this
[44:51] because we have a big challenge
[44:54] and the challenge is the manifestation.
[44:58] Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; What do we have?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; When I speak of restoration,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; what is your first thought?
[45:12] Many people their first thought is
[45:16] speaking in tongues like they did in the
[45:18] upper room.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Is right. Many times when I say I when
[45:26] God said I will restore
[45:30] What do you think?
[45:32] &gt;&gt; What it is?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Remember even the manifestation
[45:42] that Peter could say
[45:45] this is that.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And people were marveling.
[45:53] People were mocking. Even
[45:57] people called they are drunk.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; You see manifestation
[46:07] always pulls criticism
[46:14] always like that.
[46:17] So today manifestation
[46:20] against pulls up the critics.
[46:25] The critics.
[46:27] Oh my my my my. The critics
[46:31] are going to compare.
[46:36] The critics
[46:38] they say, "Oh,
[46:40] these are drunk.
[46:42] You know why they said that?
[46:45] Because they had other people seen
[46:48] acting like that
[46:50] &gt;&gt; and they were drunk.
[46:55] So that's why the critics came up
[46:58] and they compared.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; But God is never comparing.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; In God's kingdom,
[47:11] you don't have to compare.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; You have to be what you are.
[47:17] You don't have to compare with somebody.
[47:22] Don't compare yourself with the pastor.
[47:25] Don't compare yourself with the brother
[47:27] and the sister.
[47:29] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ.
[47:35] He never said follow me. He never said
[47:38] compare me. He said follow me as I
[47:42] follow Christ.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul became
[47:51] the model servant.
[47:56] Is that right?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Paul
[48:00] became the model, the example servant.
[48:09] Is that right? He was the first one. He
[48:13] was the model servant.
[48:16] So
[48:18] ah there came more servants
[48:22] we go there a little later
[48:25] to see how God is doing things.
[48:28] How God is doing things. I think it's so
[48:31] wonderful if you see
[48:33] so don't compare with one another.
[48:40] Many times when you have in a church
[48:44] something wonderful happening
[48:47] then quickly people want to do the same.
[48:52] You see somebody speaking in tongues
[48:55] somebody gives an interpretation.
[48:57] It's a great victory of God.
[49:01] Next Sunday many people want to do the
[49:03] same.
[49:12] Huh?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Because Satan has told them
[49:16] you need to be like them.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my church. Peter could say, "This is
[49:33] that what was spoken by the prophet
[49:37] Joel."
[49:38] &gt;&gt; One week later
[49:40] or two weeks later,
[49:43] the same man was in the house of
[49:45] Cornelius.
[49:50] Is that right? The same man that said
[49:54] this is that was now in the house of
[49:57] Cornelius.
[49:58] And as he preached the word, the Holy
[50:01] Spirit fell on all
[50:05] that heard the word.
[50:08] [cheering] And again,
[50:10] Peter could say, "This is also that.
[50:16] Have you watched?
[50:18] Have you watched?" Peter never compared.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; He never compared.
[50:27] He never told the people in the house of
[50:29] Cornelius
[50:31] &gt;&gt; to really be a part of that promise,
[50:35] &gt;&gt; you must speak in tongues.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; So I ask you church,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; is this
[50:57] Ah,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I'm so I'm so glad,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; you know, the first church
[51:06] that received the Holy Ghost on the day
[51:07] of Pentecost,
[51:12] very very quick
[51:16] &gt;&gt; was deceived.
[51:21] I want to say that again.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; The church that the 120,
[51:28] especially those that were in the upper
[51:30] room
[51:31] and received the Holy Ghost
[51:34] after a few years,
[51:36] they were deceived.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; You know, when Paul
[51:47] came to the church,
[51:49] You know, Paul was not in the upper
[51:50] room.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Paul was not amongst the 120.
[52:00] When the 120 was in the upper room,
[52:03] Paul was still Saul
[52:06] persecuting the church.
[52:12] Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; You know that Paul never walked with
[52:16] Jesus.
[52:19] You know that Paul never slept around
[52:21] Jesus.
[52:23] Paul never was in the boat with Jesus.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; He never was in the boat with Jesus.
[52:34] Is that right? He never eat with Jesus.
[52:37] He never drank with Jesus. He had no
[52:40] fellowship with Jesus.
[52:42] and he was called to write the New
[52:45] Testament.
[52:48] [cheering]
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Is that not amazing?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; At the time when 120 was in the upper
[52:56] room,
[52:58] Paul was in Jerusalem
[53:00] full of ambitions
[53:03] to kill the church.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[53:13] That was that was Paul.
[53:16] Then after after 15 20 years
[53:19] when he was on his way to Damascus.
[53:22] Is that right? The light strike him
[53:25] down.
[53:27] Is that right? A light striking him
[53:28] down.
[53:30] And he said, "So, Saul,
[53:33] why are you persecuting me?"
[53:38] And Saul
[53:39] &gt;&gt; was taught under Galia.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; He was taught under Galia.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So Paul or Saul knew
[53:52] that that light was Jehovah. It was God.
[53:59] So he said, "Lord,
[54:01] who are you?"
[54:05] You know the answer came back.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; I am Jesus.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Now Saul said Jesus died.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He said I am Jesus
[54:24] &gt;&gt; that you are persecuting.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; So Saul said Jesus is dead
[54:30] &gt;&gt; and I'm not persecuting Jesus.
[54:33] I'm persecuting the church.
[54:38] Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; What is the Lord answering back?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; I am.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; I am
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus in bride form.
[54:59] Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I trust we understand.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; As we speak of restoration,
[55:18] we we quickly first have to really
[55:20] understand what is restoration
[55:24] because God said, "I will restore."
[55:27] And now we are all looking around
[55:31] how how will you restore?
[55:34] And if I say
[55:37] this is that then I have to know how God
[55:41] is restoring me.
[55:44] Is that right? Peter could say this is
[55:48] that in the house of Cornelius.
[55:51] Two weeks later,
[55:53] three weeks later, he could say this is
[55:56] that
[55:59] total
[56:01] &gt;&gt; different manifestation
[56:03] in the house of Cornelius.
[56:06] Nobody spoke in tong.
[56:13] Mhm.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So once we understand
[56:17] &gt;&gt; that God is not a copycat.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; God is not somebody that is copying.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's business.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Watch it.
[56:41] This is the antichrist movement.
[56:46] That's how the church first church fell.
[56:50] Do you know how the first church fell?
[56:52] They finally make dogmas and creeds
[56:57] to keep the move of God in the camp.
[57:09] Can I speak to the Pentecostals?
[57:15] Yes, sir.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; You know, not nothing against them.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; But you know what happened when the life
[57:22] left the Pentecostal church
[57:26] because the life is going on?
[57:29] You cannot denominate God's life.
[57:38] And as they saw the life was moving on,
[57:42] they were trying to keep it in the
[57:44] church
[57:47] and they made creeds and dogmas.
[57:51] It was the Antichrist spirit
[57:54] killing the move of God.
[57:58] Amen.
[57:59] Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing
[58:05] &gt;&gt; how a church
[58:06] &gt;&gt; full of the Holy Ghost
[58:08] &gt;&gt; becomes deceived.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; The church of Pentecost.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And here one man came in
[58:21] &gt;&gt; and was not at Pentecost
[58:23] &gt;&gt; that had received also the Holy Ghost.
[58:25] Right?
[58:28] Did Paul receive the Holy Ghost?
[58:31] He he he received it while Ananas laid
[58:34] hands on him.
[58:37] Is that right? Is that right? Again,
[58:41] Peter could say again Peter could say
[58:45] this is that.
[58:48] Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my
[58:52] trust we understand what God is doing
[58:54] today.
[58:56] When you don't want to see the
[58:57] manifestation of God,
[59:00] don't look back.
[59:02] When you want to see the manifestation
[59:03] of God, ask him to open your eyes.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; So that we can say, "Hey, this is that
[59:13] and this is that and that is that and
[59:16] this is that
[59:18] &gt;&gt; everywhere."
[59:20] [cheering]
[59:22] Hallelujah.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God said, "I will restore."
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Has he restored
[59:33] &gt;&gt; or is it future
[59:35] now?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Is it future?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Do we wait on what? Do we wait?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will restore." And Peter
[59:47] could say, "This is that."
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He could say this is that in
[59:56] the house of Cornelius. He could say
[59:58] this is also that.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Church, don't limit the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years.
[1:00:11] Brother,
[1:00:15] brother Ram said in feast of the
[1:00:18] trumpets,
[1:00:20] he said 2,000 years, the Holy Spirit was
[1:00:24] bound,
[1:00:28] but should be released
[1:00:31] in the evening time by a evening time
[1:00:34] message.
[1:00:36] So a message came to declare
[1:00:41] who you are
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; to declare
[1:00:45] to declare
[1:00:46] you are a part of the restoration.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit was bound and you see signs
[1:01:01] and wonders.
[1:01:10] I'm so glad we had a prophet.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You know what happened with the first
[1:01:14] church?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Paul came too late.
[1:01:22] That's why Paul said, "I'm born out of
[1:01:26] season."
[1:01:33] Paul said, "I'm born out of season."
[1:01:37] Paul understood.
[1:01:39] I come too late. That's why he told I
[1:01:42] think one of the churches.
[1:01:45] Who has bewitched you?
[1:01:49] Is it right?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He's telling one of the churches,
[1:01:52] Galatians, I think it is.
[1:01:55] Who has bewitched you?
[1:02:02] You started so well
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; on the day of Pentecost.
[1:02:07] Who has bewitched you?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So Paul recognized
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; he came too late to the church.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; You are there.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; You know why did God do that?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Why did God do that? God allowed that.
[1:02:33] Because you had to come.
[1:02:39] [cheering and applause]
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Why did God allow
[1:02:43] the fall in Eden?
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you had to come.
[1:02:56] Is that right?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Because God wanted to show things of him
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; that he could not show without the fall.
[1:03:06] That's why.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; That's why God created Satan.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; God created Satan
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; because God needs him.
[1:03:22] Without
[1:03:26] Satan,
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; without the bad one,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; without the evil one,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; God cannot show that he's a good God.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; If we never had evil amongst us,
[1:03:44] if we never had evil amongst us,
[1:03:47] we would not know what good means.
[1:03:52] Is that right? Come on.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; If you never had night,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't appreciate the sun.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; You know how quickly we can get tired of
[1:04:02] the hot sun.
[1:04:06] How quickly we get tired of the hot sun,
[1:04:10] but then let it pour rain, rain, rain,
[1:04:12] rain.
[1:04:14] Then you start getting happy of the sun.
[1:04:28] You understand that? You understand
[1:04:30] that?
[1:04:32] I mean, I saw here you have now in
[1:04:34] December.
[1:04:36] It was too hot here,
[1:04:39] right? And people start complaining.
[1:04:43] Oh, we need, you know, it's so hot and
[1:04:44] so hot and no sun, no sun
[1:04:49] now. If it rains now for two weeks,
[1:04:54] I'm sure you are all praying for sun,
[1:05:01] [cheering]
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:03] You understand?
[1:05:05] That's why God had to allow those
[1:05:07] things.
[1:05:09] How can we know
[1:05:11] that God is a good God
[1:05:14] if there's not evil?
[1:05:18] [cheering] That's why God needed Satan.
[1:05:22] That's why God needed the fall.
[1:05:26] Yes. That's why God needed
[1:05:30] Come on.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; When Paul came on the scene,
[1:05:35] you know, when the light strike him
[1:05:37] down,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Paul could have said, "Why now?"
[1:05:43] And when he came to the church, the
[1:05:46] church was already a fallen woman.
[1:05:49] Can we see that? You know why? Because
[1:05:53] if Paul would be in the upper room
[1:05:57] if there's a prophet in the land,
[1:06:00] there is no deception.
[1:06:06] If there's a true major prophet in the
[1:06:08] land,
[1:06:11] there's no deception.
[1:06:14] If Paul would be in the upper room,
[1:06:17] amen, he would have discerned the
[1:06:20] antichrist spirit
[1:06:23] as this prophet
[1:06:26] discerned the antichrist spirit.
[1:06:29] And he told us in the message to watch
[1:06:33] that antichrist spirit.
[1:06:36] Read the church age book. Read the
[1:06:38] church age book. There you find him. The
[1:06:42] prophet declared him.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet declared him so that we
[1:06:48] today
[1:06:49] understand what the antichrist spirit
[1:06:52] trying to do.
[1:06:54] And allow me to say. The antichrist
[1:06:56] spirit is trying to make you compare.
[1:07:02] He's trying to make you compare.
[1:07:05] Compare with this church. Compare with
[1:07:07] your church. Compare with this church.
[1:07:10] When this church has this music,
[1:07:13] we must have the same music.
[1:07:16] When that pastor is driving that car, we
[1:07:19] must have the same car. When that church
[1:07:21] has this seat, we must have the same
[1:07:24] seats.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; If you understand,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Peter never compared.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Peter never said in the house of
[1:07:42] Cornelius,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; "Oh, you didn't spoke in tongues."
[1:07:50] He never compared, "Come on, church." He
[1:07:54] could have told them, "Go in the upper
[1:07:57] room and wait."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; He could have told them,
[1:08:03] "Come on, church. You see the antichrist
[1:08:06] spirit working.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Peter could could tell the Bible said as
[1:08:13] he preached.
[1:08:16] So he never preached about the upper
[1:08:18] room.
[1:08:21] He never preached about the upper room.
[1:08:24] He never pointed the people to the upper
[1:08:26] room.
[1:08:28] He preached the word,
[1:08:32] not words.
[1:08:34] He preached [screaming] the word. He
[1:08:36] preached Christ.
[1:08:38] And as he preached Christ
[1:08:41] without pointing them to the upper room,
[1:08:44] come on. He was he was in the upper
[1:08:47] room.
[1:08:48] He was in the upper room. He could say,
[1:08:51] "Come guys, come to the room." And we
[1:08:54] will have another upper room.
[1:08:58] Ah,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; that would be the antichrist spirit.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's strong. Maybe
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; you understand.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But as he preached, the Holy Ghost fell
[1:09:21] on all.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; So that means Joel
[1:09:26] fulfilled itself again.
[1:09:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:09:33] and forever.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's the major scripture for us. Is it
[1:09:42] right?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That is actually the the major scripture
[1:09:46] of the message
[1:09:48] Jesus Christ the same.
[1:09:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But the same doesn't mean
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; you repeat.
[1:10:04] Oh, here we go.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; But allow me to we we we start we try to
[1:10:16] start slowly
[1:10:21] first. Let's really see
[1:10:23] what restoration really is.
[1:10:27] Let's also see
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; what reformation is.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] Praise God.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Because there's I believe
[1:10:46] where many people stumble.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; God said, "I will restore
[1:10:56] God never said, "I will reform."
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; God said, "I will restore."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And restore
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; is to bring back.
[1:11:14] That's restoration. That's restoration.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Restore.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:23] Now
[1:11:25] reformation
[1:11:27] allow me to to to make that plain.
[1:11:30] The difference between reformation and
[1:11:32] restoration.
[1:11:36] You can see when many people today speak
[1:11:38] of restoration
[1:11:41] actually they speak of reformation.
[1:11:51] Reformation.
[1:11:54] is to improve
[1:11:57] an established religion
[1:12:01] with new ideas.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That's reformation.
[1:12:10] See what established religions
[1:12:15] trying to do today to keep the people
[1:12:20] right. They try to install new ideas,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; but that's reformation.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That is not this.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Come on church. When people say this is
[1:12:43] restoration,
[1:12:45] you can say no. That is not this
[1:12:50] because God said I will restore
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; not reform.
[1:12:57] Restoration
[1:12:59] is a return
[1:13:01] to its original roots.
[1:13:06] That's restoration.
[1:13:10] Simple example.
[1:13:12] A restoration of the house
[1:13:16] is to bring back its original beauty.
[1:13:23] Reformation
[1:13:25] is putting new wallpaper on the wall
[1:13:32] or putting new paint.
[1:13:35] That's reformation.
[1:13:39] But restoration
[1:13:41] is bringing back
[1:13:43] the original beauty.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That's my sister.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Paint on your face
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; is not restoring beauty.
[1:14:06] You're trying to reform yourself.
[1:14:14] I could say the same things about the
[1:14:16] brothers.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; How many times we are trying to add new
[1:14:22] ideas?
[1:14:24] It's just reformation.
[1:14:28] But God said, "I will restore."
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now stay with me for a for a
[1:14:38] few minutes
[1:14:40] because to be going a little bit to the
[1:14:41] church ages
[1:14:44] and you will like the church age book
[1:14:45] after that much more than now.
[1:14:50] This judge age book
[1:14:57] give you a little example.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Who choose
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; who give name to all the animals?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Adam did
[1:15:11] that species
[1:15:13] that came at last.
[1:15:17] You know the serpent came before him.
[1:15:22] You know, the serpent was on earth
[1:15:23] before Adam.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So the serpent could tell Adam,
[1:15:31] "I'm longer here than you.
[1:15:38] Who are you trying to give me my name?
[1:15:45] [laughter]
[1:15:47] Is it right?
[1:15:49] You can see God had seven stars in his
[1:15:52] hand.
[1:15:54] But the last star
[1:15:57] was able to name all the other stars.
[1:16:02] [cheering] The last star in the hand of
[1:16:03] God. To him it was given to name all the
[1:16:08] other stars.
[1:16:10] Never Paul [screaming]
[1:16:12] could name all the other stars.
[1:16:16] No. Never Paul.
[1:16:20] Paul couldn't name.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; It was William Brennan.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; The last star in the hand of God
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; because time has to run in continuity.
[1:16:32] And the last star.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; He was able to name all the other stars.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here was William Brham
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; A human being like you and me
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; and he was looking. Now who is that
[1:16:54] star?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that star?
[1:17:04] Who is the first messenger?
[1:17:07] Because revelation was writing
[1:17:09] to the messenger of the churches of
[1:17:12] Ephesus. Right.
[1:17:16] Who was that messenger?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; We know it was Paul today.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; But Paul never said, "I'm the one."
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; It was William Brandon,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; the last star.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:17:40] And and watch very carefully
[1:17:43] here comes the principle out
[1:17:48] that God is always using.
[1:17:51] It is actually a keystone revelation of
[1:17:54] the whole Bible.
[1:18:11] I will read that to you makes it easier
[1:18:15] out of the church age book.
[1:18:18] Now you understand that.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Here we had a man like you and me.
[1:18:25] Now he has to find out
[1:18:29] who is what
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; is this that?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Oh no
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; no no. [laughter]
[1:18:37] He had to find out
[1:18:39] is this man that
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; or is this man that or is that man that?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Finally, he could say
[1:18:48] Paul
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; is the messenger to Ephesus.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; This excites me church.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; This excites me.
[1:19:00] And the trust goat opens our hearts
[1:19:03] what God is doing right now
[1:19:06] because we are here declaring
[1:19:10] declaring
[1:19:12] Hebrews 13:8
[1:19:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday Jesus
[1:19:18] Christ is same today Jesus Christ is
[1:19:20] same forever
[1:19:22] so that we can say this is that
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; oh I'm so happy that that we that we can
[1:19:33] dive down deep.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Raman said, "I'm only scratching
[1:19:41] on the surface."
[1:19:43] He said, "But you go down and you dig
[1:19:46] down deep
[1:19:48] and much more it become elevated."
[1:19:53] The prophet would say, "God would raise
[1:19:56] young men,
[1:19:58] ministers
[1:19:59] that would dig down deep not because
[1:20:02] they are clever,
[1:20:04] not because they are special mates,
[1:20:07] but because they heal themselves
[1:20:09] to the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[1:20:13] so that he can bring out the deep things
[1:20:15] of God."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I know that will that will bother some
[1:20:32] of us.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; But he was a man William Brandham.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He looked through historical books.
[1:20:44] He was reading the revival books
[1:20:48] of the church history. Remember
[1:20:54] why Paul?
[1:20:57] Paul never was with Jesus.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Paul persecuted the Jews.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Why Paul was chosen
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; to be the church as messenger to
[1:21:14] Ephesus?
[1:21:18] Why not Peter?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Why not James?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Why not John?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Why not Luke?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Why not Matthew?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Why Paul?
[1:21:38] Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, when you once understand
[1:21:43] God's great plan,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; then you understand why you had to
[1:21:48] choose Paul.
[1:21:50] Now remember,
[1:21:53] brother Wam was choosing him
[1:21:56] because he had a scriptural key.
[1:22:01] And with that scriptural key,
[1:22:06] he was looking
[1:22:08] He was looking
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:12] A key is there to open doors.
[1:22:15] And his scriptural key
[1:22:19] that scripture key
[1:22:21] was Hebrews 13:8.
[1:22:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:22:27] today, and forever.
[1:22:30] Amen. with that key
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; he could say this
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; is that
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; this is the messenger to Ephesus
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; church with that key
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; in our hands we can say today this is
[1:22:52] that this is that this is that
[1:23:01] And you're not looking for copies.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; As we said when Peter was in the house
[1:23:09] of Cornelius,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; he could say again this is that and
[1:23:16] nobody spoke in tongues.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You can follow.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] Who was it? Then he went on.
[1:23:32] Then there was a man Ireinius.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Arinius.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Arinius
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; the church age messenger.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And by the way
[1:23:44] Paul
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I think was not married. Is that right?
[1:23:52] Paul was not married.
[1:24:02] Martin Luther
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; was married.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; John Wesley
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; was married.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Arinius.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Arinas.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Many of the messengers
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; were married.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Just to that the penny can drop.
[1:24:46] How God is doing things.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet used
[1:25:00] a scripture key
[1:25:02] to find out Paul, to find out Arinius,
[1:25:06] to find out Martin, to find out Cola, to
[1:25:10] find out Martin Luther. Martin Lutter is
[1:25:12] my German brother.
[1:25:16] I tell you what, I would have never
[1:25:19] chosen him
[1:25:23] to be the messenger.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; He was a trinitarian.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He was a trinitarian.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He hated the Jewish people.
[1:25:50] He liked to drink wine.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I would never have chosen a messenger.
[1:26:11] [sighs]
[1:26:14] Are you with me
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; now?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; What is God looking at
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; so that he can say
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; this is that no
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I pray that God helps us
[1:26:34] to break into it
[1:26:37] to understand
[1:26:39] that God ordained your life.
[1:26:42] God ordained your parents. God ordained
[1:26:45] your grandparents.
[1:26:47] God ordained your grand great
[1:26:48] grandparents
[1:26:52] so you could turn up
[1:26:54] because God wanted to show
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; through you
[1:26:59] a special part of himself.
[1:27:04] [cheering]
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; What did God wanted to manifest
[1:27:10] in the time of Martin Luther?
[1:27:13] Justification.
[1:27:16] just shall live by faith.
[1:27:21] That's why he needed someone that was
[1:27:23] drinking
[1:27:25] to manifest
[1:27:27] to manifest the just shall live by
[1:27:30] faith.
[1:27:36] You understand that it depends what God
[1:27:39] wants to show.
[1:27:42] When the enemy comes in like a flood,
[1:27:45] the spirit of God raising the standard
[1:27:47] against him.
[1:27:52] My my my my
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; one day
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; the devil was coming to Martin Luther
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; and said, "Martin,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; you drink too much."
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You know what L said?
[1:28:06] If you come to me and rebuke me of
[1:28:10] drinking too much,
[1:28:12] I drink another one.
[1:28:18] Why?
[1:28:20] Why don't we do the same thing today?
[1:28:23] Because today God want to show more of
[1:28:26] him.
[1:28:29] But that time coming out of the
[1:28:32] Catholic. Yes.
[1:28:34] Coming out of works, works. works works
[1:28:37] works.
[1:28:39] God want to show no I will have a man
[1:28:42] who can show and demonstrate the just
[1:28:46] shall live by faith.
[1:28:51] You understand it depends
[1:28:54] what God wants to show from him.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Now we have to we have to leave that the
[1:29:13] time is time is running.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; But you understand.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's why the whole church ages
[1:29:21] was not restoration
[1:29:25] even 1906
[1:29:29] the great outpouring.
[1:29:31] The restoration of the gifts
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; was reformation.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You better believe that
[1:29:44] because we had a we had a messenger
[1:29:47] who who told us
[1:29:50] and because he told us this church will
[1:29:55] not be deceived.
[1:29:57] That's why we today are not being
[1:30:00] deceived
[1:30:02] because we had a messenger.
[1:30:04] The first church
[1:30:06] missed that messenger in the upper room.
[1:30:11] That's why the antichrist spirit
[1:30:14] could come into the church. One
[1:30:16] comparing with the other
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; bishops
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; over bishops
[1:30:28] Uhhuh.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:30:32] Come on.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; What was that?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; The Antichrist spirit moving in.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; I'm more value than you.
[1:30:44] I'm a higher bishop than you.
[1:30:52] Come on.
[1:30:54] And this came to a climax
[1:30:57] in the dark ages.
[1:31:00] Is that right? You had to pay.
[1:31:04] You had to confess. You had to pay for
[1:31:07] your soul to come out of hell.
[1:31:10] And then God needed a character.
[1:31:13] He needed a Martin Luther
[1:31:16] because he wanted to show in that church
[1:31:18] age
[1:31:20] that the just shall live by faith.
[1:31:23] That's why when brother Brandham looked
[1:31:26] at Martin Luther,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; he said that's the man
[1:31:31] for that church age.
[1:31:36] John Wesley.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; John Wesley.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; John Wesley.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; He was a church age messenger
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; to the church age. Let me quickly read
[1:31:45] it. I'm not good in remembering. Of
[1:31:47] Philadelphia.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Philadelphia.
[1:31:53] [sighs]
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; John Wesley.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; John Wesley
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; had a broken up marriage.
[1:32:16] First of all,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Paul was not married.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; John Wesley was married.
[1:32:26] So if you look to the messengers
[1:32:30] you understand
[1:32:32] not one messenger
[1:32:34] was a copy of the other one.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:41] is not you compare with one another.
[1:32:44] Jesus Christ the same that is this
[1:32:49] Jesus Christ the same. Hebrews 13:8.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; It's not you try to be like brother
[1:33:01] Steven.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You not try to copy brother
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; SA.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; You not copy that guy from Germany.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; You be what you are.
[1:33:17] You be [cheering] what you are
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; because God needs you.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I always tell the people at home,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; God invested in you
[1:33:29] so much money and so much brain
[1:33:36] he was not cheap
[1:33:39] to bring you here.
[1:33:42] You know that it was not easy to bring
[1:33:45] you here.
[1:33:47] Go back to your family tree.
[1:33:50] My family tree,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; my grandfather was in World War II.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; My mother
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; or my father actually he was uh he was
[1:34:06] engaged
[1:34:08] to another woman.
[1:34:12] I just want to show you
[1:34:15] my mother
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; before my father married her,
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; my mother my mother was engaged to
[1:34:24] another man
[1:34:33] or my mother or my grandmother.
[1:34:36] It broke.
[1:34:41] so that my father
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and my mother could marry
[1:34:47] so I
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; can be today what I am.
[1:34:54] Oh, come on.
[1:34:56] Go back your history. Go back your
[1:34:58] family tree.
[1:35:03] You how many times your great great
[1:35:06] great grandfathers,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; mothers
[1:35:10] could have died on the way.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:23] You know how much brain,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; how much sweat
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; God invested
[1:35:30] in your coming.
[1:35:34] He had a host of angels
[1:35:38] busy to preparing to protect
[1:35:41] your great grandparents
[1:35:44] to protect your parents
[1:35:47] so that you can be here right now.
[1:35:50] Amen. [cheering]
[1:35:52] So don't
[1:35:54] become a cheap copy.
[1:35:57] Be what you are.
[1:36:00] Be a Christian.
[1:36:03] Be a Christian,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; but be what you are.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; If you are a sister,
[1:36:11] be happy that you are a sister.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a man.
[1:36:20] Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; If you're a man,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; be a man.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a sister.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that simple enough? Is that
[1:36:39] simple enough?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; So when you are what you are,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I can say this is that
[1:36:50] If you are a Christian, if you are a
[1:36:53] Christian today, born again by the Holy
[1:36:56] Ghost,
[1:36:57] I can say this is that
[1:37:03] [cheering]
[1:37:03] I will restore and I can say God has
[1:37:07] restored.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; God has restored
[1:37:12] all the [screaming] years
[1:37:14] that was beaten down. The bride tree
[1:37:18] is standing again.
[1:37:21] And her fruits,
[1:37:24] her fruits,
[1:37:27] her fruits,
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; not his fruits,
[1:37:34] her fruits.
[1:37:36] Have you not read that in the beginning?
[1:37:38] It is her fruits.
[1:37:42] It's a feminist tree.
[1:37:45] It's a feminist tree.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; It is a bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:50] Hallelujah.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; That's why I can say today.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; No, we have so many points, so many
[1:37:56] things.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; No, we we we don't do we don't go there.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; But you know what the problem was at
[1:38:05] Pentecost?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; The problem was manifestation.
[1:38:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; The problem was the manifestation.
[1:38:19] People marveled.
[1:38:21] What is this?
[1:38:24] Some was mocking.
[1:38:26] They are drunk.
[1:38:28] What do they say today? They are
[1:38:30] fanatics.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; They are cults.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:42] That's what they did at that time. When
[1:38:45] they saw the manifestation,
[1:38:47] they had to put it in a box.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; This is what Satan always has to do. He
[1:38:58] has to put you in a box.
[1:39:01] But the bride of Jesus Christ is fitting
[1:39:04] in no box.
[1:39:07] [cheering] Because the bride of Jesus
[1:39:09] Christ is out of every box.
[1:39:13] She's called to come outside the camp.
[1:39:18] She's called out of my people.
[1:39:23] Come out of every denomination.
[1:39:27] Come out of every limitation.
[1:39:31] Because denimation
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; creates and darkmas
[1:39:36] limitations.

[1:39:52] denominations
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; is limitations.

[1:40:29] old brother in the message,

[1:41:34] if you're a Christian,
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; you are Christlike.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; With other words, you say,
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; "I am
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Christ."
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:57] So don't limit yourself.

[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Limit themsel.
[1:42:54] Come on church.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:42:59] then Jesus would say,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; "Search the scriptures."
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal
[1:43:05] life
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; and they speak of me.

[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; We are Jehovah Witness witness.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; We would like to talk. Would you like to
[1:43:36] talk to us?"
[1:43:38] The brother said, "Oh, that's
[1:43:40] interesting. You are witness.
[1:43:44] I am his son.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; So as they have classified themselves to
[1:44:03] Jehovah witness
[1:44:08] put a limitation around them.
[1:44:12] The brother said that's funny.
[1:44:16] You are witnesses.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I'm a son.
[1:44:21] [applause]
[1:44:23] So

[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; You can say I am what I am by the grace
[1:45:10] of God.
[1:45:14] If God tells me,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; you know that Eve,
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; the woman
[1:45:23] never spoke about herself.
[1:45:30] It was Adam
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; speaking about her.
[1:45:34] What I tell you today
[1:45:37] of who you are,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; it is what the second Adam
[1:45:42] The last Adam has spoken about you
[1:45:47] [applause]
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; has spoken about me. That's why I can
[1:45:51] say today
[1:45:53] I believe what he said about me.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm so happy that I can speak to
[1:46:04] people that he has called the bride of
[1:46:09] [cheering]
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Because of misunderstood manifestations
[1:46:22] today people start denominations.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Because of misunderstood
[1:46:33] manifestations
[1:46:35] people start denominations.
[1:46:43] As it was 2,000 years ago,
[1:46:46] people looked,
[1:46:48] some was marveling,
[1:46:51] what is this? Others were mocking. Oh,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; they are drunk.
[1:46:58] Right.
[1:47:00] What did Peter say?
[1:47:02] They're not drunk.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; It's too early.
[1:47:11] It's too early.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Be normal. That's right.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; This hour of the day, nobody is trying.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I enjoy
[1:47:23] how Peter was answering.
[1:47:26] He was not making it spiritual.
[1:47:29] He said, "Come on, boys. Come to your
[1:47:32] normal senses. At this time of the day,
[1:47:35] nobody is coming.
[1:47:39] And I want to say today all that calls
[1:47:42] this fanatism
[1:47:44] come to normal
[1:47:46] in this hour.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; In this hour [screaming]
[1:47:50] you cannot be a fanatic.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; We are living in a fanatic world.
[1:48:04] We living in a crazy world.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Don't call this fanatism.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; No, this what you call fanatism.
[1:48:18] A group of people, they believe what God
[1:48:22] said about them.
[1:48:24] What you call fanatism?
[1:48:26] What you call fanatism?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] It's people
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; that believe God said about what should
[1:48:35] the woman do.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; What should what should Eve do?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; What should she do now?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Should she play humble?
[1:48:49] Oh, I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy.
[1:48:53] My husband said, "I'm flesh of his
[1:48:56] flesh,
[1:48:57] but who am I?
[1:49:06] My my husband said I'm his womb.
[1:49:12] But maybe he was wrong.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ on earth.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; We have received the message. The
[1:49:29] opening of the seals, the seals is
[1:49:32] Christ
[1:49:33] proclaiming a message to the church.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; You want to read?
[1:49:43] I can read to you the letter that God
[1:49:46] was writing to the church of Laia.
[1:49:51] I can You want to read it? Go home and
[1:49:54] read Revelation 3.
[1:49:56] You can read all what God was writing
[1:49:59] where God said, "I have against thee."
[1:50:02] But in this hour, in this hour, the Holy
[1:50:06] Ghost told the prophet, "Pick up your
[1:50:09] pen and write,
[1:50:12] I have something to say to my church."
[1:50:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Only because of this,
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; I can preach what I preach.
[1:50:25] only because of this I can say what I
[1:50:28] say
[1:50:30] and if you listen to me carefully
[1:50:33] I only said what he said
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; I cannot help
[1:50:42] that Adam said you are bone of my bone
[1:50:46] your flesh of my flesh I call you woman
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; you know that woman is not a name.
[1:50:57] You know, woman is not a name.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; No, woman is a position.
[1:51:03] That's why brother said I'm here to
[1:51:06] declare I don't call you church any
[1:51:09] longer. I call you bride. Bride is not a
[1:51:12] name. Bride is a position.
[1:51:17] [applause]
[1:51:19] And Adam said your name that means who
[1:51:23] you are.
[1:51:25] You understand that your name classifies
[1:51:28] who you are.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Said you are woman.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Woman means
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; stay with me for two minutes.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:51:46] Woman means
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; the womb
[1:51:50] of the manh.
[1:52:01] [laughter]
[1:52:01] Not it's it's reality, church.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Adam
[1:52:07] lost his womb.
[1:52:12] Hey,
[1:52:20] [laughter]
[1:52:20] and Adam understood
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; without my womb.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I can do nothing.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; You're with me. Come on, church.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You follow it.
[1:52:42] You follow it
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; the way Adam reacted.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Why did Adam went with her?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Adam was a prophet.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He saw every every sick
[1:52:53] home. He saw every disease coming
[1:52:55] because of the fall.
[1:52:59] And yet he chose his wife.
[1:53:02] You know why? [screaming]
[1:53:04] There was no other one.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; There was no other womb. Without
[1:53:13] the woman,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; he could do nothing.
[1:53:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Allow me to say
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; without you.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; can do nothing.
[1:53:30] [applause]
[1:53:33] Hallelujah.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:53:39] as God
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; put Adam to sleep
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; and he took out of Adam
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; the womb
[1:53:52] the feminist part
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; is that right
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; so God put Christ
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; at Calvary
[1:54:02] in a deep sleep
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; can I say it like this
[1:54:09] to take the feminist part
[1:54:12] out of Christ.
[1:54:17] Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And 2,000 years
[1:54:21] 2,000 years. Christ is looking for his
[1:54:25] bride.
[1:54:27] and his promise I will restore
[1:54:31] all the years
[1:54:34] that that bride tree
[1:54:36] was going down
[1:54:39] but now we see the bride tree

[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; we had a prophet in the land.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad.
[1:55:15] Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We have to stop.

[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Is

[1:55:44] the restoration?
[1:55:53] Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some say
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; they are drunk.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Some say they are just fanatics.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Some marvel.
[1:56:08] What is this?
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; But Peter could say
[1:56:13] this.
[1:56:15] They
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; 120.
[1:56:20] Everyone
[1:56:21] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:56:24] Joel
[1:56:26] and church.
[1:56:29] Allow me to say
[1:56:31] this.
[1:56:33] Everyone here who is a Christian who is
[1:56:36] born again who has received the Holy
[1:56:39] Ghost is that
[1:56:42] was spoken by the prophet.
[1:56:46] [applause]
[1:56:49] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:56:51] Sorry, I had no time to read to you all
[1:56:53] the quotes.
[1:56:56] To read to you all the quotes.
[1:57:00] I have dozens of quotes.
[1:57:03] So, but what I preached, you believe
[1:57:07] it was what the prophet said.
[1:57:10] I would never never be courage enough to
[1:57:12] say you these things
[1:57:15] without having the prophet for it.
[1:57:19] Let us stand to our feet. Amen. God
[1:57:21] bless you. [applause]
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; If [applause]
[1:57:32] if
[1:57:33] this
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; is that
[1:57:38] we are further than we think.
[1:57:43] Is that right?
[1:57:48] If this
[1:57:50] is that,
[1:57:52] you are the judge. Now,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; you are the judge.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; I don't say that.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; You have to say it.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; You have to look in your own life.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:58:12] My goodness.
[1:58:14] My goodness.
[1:58:16] Jesus was in his own life.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; He was at the cross
[1:58:24] thirsty,
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; forgotten.
[1:58:27] He was at the cross,
[1:58:30] forgotten,
[1:58:31] despised,
[1:58:33] spit at.
[1:58:36] And he know there was one scripture that
[1:58:40] was not fulfilled.
[1:58:42] And he said,
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; "I'm thirsty
[1:58:50] to fulfill
[1:58:52] what the prophet
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; had already spoken."
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen.
[1:59:07] I pray that the Lord allows us to step
[1:59:13] into that reality.
[1:59:18] I pray
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I can do not more than this preaching.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; The rest is up to him.
[1:59:29] Amen.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; as a born again believer
[1:59:36] filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; can you look at your life
[1:59:42] and have the courage to say this?
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; As I said this morning,
[1:59:56] the rapture will happen in an unusual
[1:59:59] way.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; In a time of great trouble,
[2:00:08] great persecution,
[2:00:10] great things
[2:00:12] in Satan's Eden,
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in the secret of his
[2:00:17] pavilion.
[2:00:20] He shall set me upon a rock.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I want to ask that again.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Every truly born again Christian
[2:00:32] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:36] Can you look into your life?
[2:00:39] Look to your circumstance.
[2:00:42] Can you say
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; this
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; is that?
[2:00:57] Hallelujah.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; When you read Hebrews 11,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; the great faith chapter,
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; would you see it as an act of faith?
[2:01:15] to be cut into pieces.
[2:01:19] The Bible said by faith it would cut
[2:01:24] into pieces.
[2:01:34] You need faith
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; for your healing.
[2:01:39] You need more faith
[2:01:41] when you are not healed.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I want to say that again.
[2:01:54] You need faith for healing.
[2:01:57] When you are not healed,
[2:02:00] you need more faith.
[2:02:10] Hallelujah.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Is this that
[2:02:18] just one or two minutes?
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Maybe we close our eyes.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Just close your eyes.
[2:02:36] Can you say
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; with conviction
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; this
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; is that

[2:03:32] Would you raise your hand
[2:03:34] and say, "Lord,
[2:03:36] help me.
[2:03:48] church.
[2:03:50] I never said this is that.
[2:03:54] It was just a question.
[2:03:57] When I speak for myself,
[2:04:00] I can say today
[2:04:02] in great humility
[2:04:05] this that
[2:04:10] as we have lifted our hands,
[2:04:13] we want to ask the Lord now
[2:04:16] to give us a clearer understanding
[2:04:21] that we are not confused about the
[2:04:23] manifestation.
[2:04:27] who want a greater
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; understanding of the true manifestation
[2:04:32] of this hour.
[2:04:35] Hallelujah.

[2:05:03] convince the people
[2:05:07] I just preached
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; that your holy spirit can take it
[2:05:12] further
[2:05:17] you have seen so many hands is raised
[2:05:21] father because of the manifestation
[2:05:23] It was 2,000 years. It was a great
[2:05:25] problem. Was a manifestation.
[2:05:29] And how is it today?
[2:05:34] Help us father
[2:05:36] that we understand Hebrews 13:8.
[2:05:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[2:05:44] in so many different ways.
[2:05:47] Father, I pray that your great Holy
[2:05:49] Spirit.
[2:05:51] This is not anymore a church revelation.
[2:05:55] This is not just a church gathering.
[2:06:00] This is your bride.
[2:06:02] This is the elect
[2:06:04] coming together,
[2:06:06] each individual
[2:06:09] finding its place.
[2:06:11] Father I pray may the spirit of wisdom
[2:06:13] and revelation
[2:06:16] move amongst your people. I pray father
[2:06:19] so that each and everyone
[2:06:22] receive the courage to say this.
[2:06:27] I pray it father not for the glory of a
[2:06:30] man.
[2:06:32] I pray that
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; so that your name will be glorified.
[2:06:37] I pray that father that it be glorified
[2:06:41] what you have done in this hour
[2:06:44] because you has restored
[2:06:47] all the years
[2:06:49] that the church was eaten down.
[2:06:52] Hallelujah. We thank you father. We ask
[2:06:55] it in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:06:59] Amen and amen.

[2:07:14] [applause]
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; He's not forcing us. He's not forcing
[2:07:22] you.
[2:07:23] He's not forcing you. The Holy Spirit is
[2:07:26] a gentleman.
[2:07:30] He's not forcing you.
[2:07:34] No,
[2:07:36] he is not pushing you.
[2:07:38] The Holy Spirit is pulling you.
[2:07:42] Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit as he is a gentleman,
[2:07:48] he is not pushing you.
[2:07:50] [music]
[2:07:51] He waits for you.
[2:07:54] He waits for you.
[2:07:56] Remember in the days of Noah,
[2:07:59] where did the call came from?
[2:08:03] When did Noah went into the ark?
[2:08:06] The Bible said there was a day when God
[2:08:10] said to Noah.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Noah, come into the ark.
[2:08:15] Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; God never said to Noah, "Go in the ark."
[2:08:20] He said, "Come in the ark."
[2:08:23] It was God pulling him into the ark.
[2:08:27] This is not the third push.
[2:08:30] This is the third Paul.
[2:08:33] He's a gentleman, isn't he? Oh, don't we
[2:08:36] serve a wonderful God?
[2:08:39] He's a gentleman.
[2:08:41] He's not pushing at you.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; But I want to close with this again.
[2:08:47] Is this that
[2:08:51] is this that
[2:08:54] I can say today?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:59] I can speak for myself.
[2:09:01] I can say yes.
[2:09:03] This what I'm experiencing,
[2:09:07] this what I go through. This this where
[2:09:10] I am. This is that restoration
[2:09:14] that was promised he would have. I can
[2:09:16] speak for myself.
[2:09:18] You have to speak for yourself.
[2:09:21] God bless you.
[2:09:24] [applause]
[2:09:28] And brother James is coming. God bless
[2:09:30] you, brother James.
