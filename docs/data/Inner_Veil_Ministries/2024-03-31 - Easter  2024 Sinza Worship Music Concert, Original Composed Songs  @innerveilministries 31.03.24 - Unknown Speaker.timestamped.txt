[54:29] Sunday as a memory about his
[54:33] resurrection and then also you remember

[54:40] Sunday when the church was
[54:43] born the church was born on the first
[54:45] day of the

[54:58] Done and Christ should not just only be

[1:24:58] reason to

[1:25:14] has made us we are what we are because
[1:25:18] of the Lord praise the name of the Lord

[1:25:36] your colleagues they are better than me
[1:25:39] this they are better than don't look at
[1:25:42] that look at what the Lord has made you
[1:25:46] to praise the name of the Bible says is
[1:25:50] all the body the

[1:26:00] if you are the
[1:26:01] ear you are the if you are the nose you
[1:26:05] are the nose whatever portion of the
[1:26:08] body the Lord has made to you just need
[1:26:11] to thank him for
[1:26:12] that praise the name of the Lord we have
[1:26:15] a reason to
[1:26:17] worship God has created
[1:26:20] us that we may worship Him praise the
[1:26:24] name of our Lord and in worshiping God
[1:26:28] God wants us to walk before
[1:26:32] him God wants us to seek
[1:26:35] Him Praise the name of our Lord you know
[1:26:38] you are seeking the Lord you are having
[1:26:41] a longing for the Lord you are having a
[1:26:44] desire for the
[1:26:45] Lord And now when you have that longing
[1:26:48] for God you have that desire for the
[1:26:52] Lord and then you serve the
[1:26:55] Lord in whatever form you are
[1:26:58] in at your home at your place of work
[1:27:02] wherever you live you you serve the Lord
[1:27:06] in whatever kind of thing he has given
[1:27:08] you to do praise the name of our Lord
[1:27:11] and when you seek the
[1:27:13] Lord you serve the Lord then you need to
[1:27:17] Worship the
[1:27:18] Lord praise the name of our Lord so then
[1:27:20] our lives should be fully attached to
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:24] Lord that my
[1:27:27] being the way I am is just because the
[1:27:31] Lord is praise the name of our Lord he

[1:27:55] you have reason to seek him you have
[1:27:58] reason to Worship the Lord all the days
[1:28:01] of your life praise the name of our Lord
[1:28:03] so you see that in the scriptures Before
[1:28:06] the Throne of God they saying
[1:28:10] holy holy praise the name of our Lord
[1:28:13] even us our life should sound that
[1:28:18] Holiness to the
[1:28:19] Lord praise the name of the Lord the
[1:28:22] Bible says when high priest on his crown
[1:28:27] on his head they put
[1:28:30] Holiness and
[1:28:32] righteousness unto the Lord it should
[1:28:34] also be the same thing to us that our
[1:28:37] lives reflect the Holiness of God our
[1:28:41] lives reflect the righteousness of God
[1:28:45] praise the name of our like when Pastor
[1:28:47] was preaching last Sunday why do you
[1:28:50] need to be
[1:28:52] angry okay you may be annoyed
[1:28:54] but the Bible says don't allow
[1:28:59] anger you know the sun to go over your
[1:29:03] anger praise the name of the Lord you
[1:29:06] know when you are living in
[1:29:08] Anger you are in bondage
[1:29:11] yourself so how are you going to
[1:29:14] worship and when you are angry you end
[1:29:17] up
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:20] complaining how are you going
[1:29:22] toship and
[1:29:24] anger brings
[1:29:28] bitterness praise the name of our Lord
[1:29:30] and bitterness is not part of the Holy
[1:29:34] Spirit praise the name of the Lord so
[1:29:36] you get that girl of bitterness
[1:29:41] away you just put it
[1:29:44] aside even us do you want to eat things
[1:29:47] which are
[1:29:48] bitter have you ever seen somebody
[1:29:50] eating bitter things and he's
[1:29:53] smiling
[1:29:55] and you find it is so
[1:29:58] painful so even people are
[1:30:01] angry that's how they bit before other
[1:30:04] people you shouldn't be like
[1:30:07] that praise the name of the Lord we
[1:30:09] should that kind of
[1:30:17] temperance you know bearing with one
[1:30:20] another praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:23] loving one
[1:30:24] another desing one
[1:30:27] another praise the name of our Lord
[1:30:29] whereby you feel when your brother is in
[1:30:33] a
[1:30:34] mistake you don't take you know offense
[1:30:36] about it but you stand with such a one
[1:30:40] in
[1:30:41] prayer and that's what we are called for
[1:30:44] praise the name of don't allow anger be
[1:30:48] there otherwise it will
[1:30:52] hinder and you see the Bible says let us
[1:30:56] go to Ephesians
[1:31:00] 4:31 praise the name of our
[1:31:03] lordian 4
[1:31:06] verse it says and grieve not the holy
[1:31:10] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:31:13] until the day of
[1:31:22] redemption the Bible says grieve not the
[1:31:26] Holy
[1:31:29] Spirit by which you are
[1:31:31] sealed until the day of
[1:31:34] redemption and how can you
[1:31:37] worship without the Holy
[1:31:40] Spirit how can you worship when the
[1:31:44] scripture tells us when we go to John
[1:31:47] chapter
[1:31:49] 4 praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:31:53] verse 23
[1:31:58] the Bible
[1:32:00] says but the hour cometh and now is when
[1:32:05] the true worshippers shall worship the
[1:32:08] father in spirit and in truth for the
[1:32:12] father seeketh such to worship
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:22] Him
[1:32:32] says God
[1:32:35] seeks the
[1:32:36] worshipers true
[1:32:39] worshipers to worship him in his
[1:32:43] spirit and in his
[1:32:46] truth but now you have grieved the Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost how are you going to worship so
[1:32:53] your worship is not
[1:33:53] go back to Ephesians chapter
[1:33:55] 4 and then verse
[1:33:58] 31 let all
[1:34:02] bitterness and
[1:34:04] R and
[1:34:06] anger and
[1:34:08] clamor and evil
[1:34:10] speaking be put away from
[1:34:14] you with
[1:34:17] all so now you see here
[1:34:21] bitterness griefs the Holy Ghost
[1:34:27] R gas the Holy
[1:34:31] Ghost griefs the Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] clor griefs the Holy
[1:34:37] Ghost evil speaking gri the Holy Ghost
[1:34:45] all gri the Holy
[1:34:47] Ghost so you can't
[1:34:50] worship if you are
[1:34:52] angry you can't worship if you are in
[1:34:57] bitterness you can't worship if you are
[1:35:01] wrathful you can't worship if you doing
[1:35:06] clamor you can't worship if you evil
[1:35:10] speaking and you can't was if you have
[1:35:14] Marice and that's why the Bible says
[1:35:17] when you come and bring your sacrifice
[1:35:20] to The
[1:35:22] Altar and you remember that you have
[1:35:24] something against
[1:35:26] somebody then the scripture says go and
[1:35:30] make it right with
[1:35:31] that and then you come and offer your
[1:35:35] sacrifice and then your sacrifice will
[1:35:37] be
[1:35:38] accepted when Cain Came To
[1:35:41] Worship the Bible says Cain was
[1:35:45] rejected with his sacrifice why the
[1:35:49] condition of his life was not acceptable
[1:35:52] before God
[1:35:54] and we should also live every day that
[1:35:57] the conditions our life are always
[1:36:00] acceptable before the Lord praise the
[1:36:03] name of the Lord that should be your
[1:36:05] desire like when we read in Psalms
[1:36:07] chapter
[1:36:09] 19 praise the name of the Lord Psalms
[1:36:12] chapter
[1:36:13] 19 and then we going pick that
[1:36:16] scripture verse
[1:36:18] 14 it says let the words of my
[1:36:22] mouth and the meditation of my
[1:36:26] heart be acceptable in your sight oh

[2:19:27] W they sang the song of
[2:19:31] redemption so Angels don't need to be
[2:19:36] redeemed but they were redeemed
[2:19:40] men and the 24
[2:19:42] Elders in the message of the hour they
[2:19:46] were the TR of

[2:20:01] and we have also been
[2:20:03] redeemed praise the name of our Lord now

[2:20:22] people who would believe
[2:20:24] him back
[2:20:26] y when he come out of the
[2:20:30] Wilderness he brought the children of
[2:20:32] Israel rather Into the
[2:20:35] Wilderness what a time after they had
[2:20:38] crossed the Red
[2:20:40] Sea got over there they had an old
[2:20:44] fashion camp
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:47] meeting praise the name of our Lord
[2:20:50] looked back and seen the all the old

[2:21:01] and you know pharaoh and all their army
[2:21:04] was against them chasing
[2:21:08] them and then the Lord fought the Battle
[2:21:10] for
[2:21:11] them until they crossed the dry
[2:21:14] landine in the Red Sea and now these
[2:21:18] Egyptians they wanted to partake of that
[2:21:23] praise the name of our Lord and now when
[2:21:24] the children of Israel had
[2:21:26] finished then the Lord told Moses let
[2:21:30] the water be
[2:21:31] released and then the water was
[2:21:34] released and he killed all the Egyptians
[2:21:37] were
[2:21:38] following what a victory did that was
[2:21:41] that your enemy is
[2:21:44] dead praise the name of our Lord and so
[2:21:47] your brother Bram is saying they looked
[2:21:50] back and seen all the task Masters dead
[2:21:52] in
[2:21:54] the miam begin to
[2:21:57] dance in the spirit and beat a
[2:22:01] tambin a very typical picture of an old
[2:22:04] fashioned camp

[2:22:09] raised up his hands and sang a song in
[2:22:12] the
[2:22:13] spirit that eight and old fashioned
[2:22:16] meeting I never seen
[2:22:19] one and now look God promised to supply
[2:22:23] all their
[2:22:25] needs and just when they crossed over
[2:22:29] why they didn't have
[2:22:32] nothing but a little box of bread
[2:22:34] sitting on top of their
[2:22:37] head give out so God promise would

[2:23:14] houses and then now faraoh says hey we
[2:23:18] all going to die then he releases
[2:23:21] now when they start going they
[2:23:24] remember these people have been working
[2:23:26] for
[2:23:27] us and then those demons started
[2:23:30] following
[2:23:32] them can you
[2:23:35] imagine and then the Lord made a
[2:23:38] path and these demons kept on following
[2:23:41] them and then God Dively
[2:23:45] provided and they also kept on
[2:23:47] following but they did not they
[2:23:49] following for their
[2:23:52] destruction and they were destroyed in

[2:28:23] these songs right
[2:28:25] there praise the name of our
[2:28:36] Lord okay there is also a request here
[2:28:40] let me just first read
[2:28:41] it he says sister B husband has been in
[2:28:46] hospital uh brother Isaac has been in
[2:28:50] hospital now is
[2:28:54] ino for two
[2:28:56] months some of you have not been
[2:29:00] there but others have been there
[2:29:03] certain so we would like that we make
[2:29:05] some
[2:29:07] contribution and send to them God bless
[2:29:10] you as you do
[2:29:12] that praise the name standing with one
[2:29:16] another so we are going to make a
[2:29:19] contribution as we shall be going out I
[2:29:22] think we shall have a collection at this
[2:29:23] other
[2:29:24] side where you can put in your
[2:29:27] contribution and we also want to thank
[2:29:29] you for your
[2:29:30] prayers for about 3 days
[2:29:33] now is not on
[2:29:37] oxygen praise the name of he has been on
[2:29:40] oxygen before all the
[2:29:42] time but this three days at least not on
[2:29:46] oxygen I was talking to brother Peter
[2:29:49] yesterday I think yesterday or before
[2:29:51] yesterday and then he said they measured
[2:29:53] the percentage of oxy is about in 90s so
[2:29:56] that's good
[2:29:57] enough but they are still now checking
[2:29:59] his body
[2:30:01] organs to see why he's not having
[2:30:03] appetite to
[2:30:05] eat because he feels like he's full all
[2:30:08] the
[2:30:09] time he doesn't want to eat or drink so
[2:30:12] just keep on praying for
[2:30:14] him praise the name of our Lord you know
[2:30:16] there is a difference between healing
[2:30:18] and a miracle
[2:30:22] the miracle can happen
[2:30:25] instantly but healing can take
[2:30:27] time and this is what our brother is
[2:30:30] going through so we just keep on praying
[2:30:32] for also praying for sister betri and
[2:30:36] the entire family that the Lord may give
[2:30:38] them Grace so we shall do
[2:30:41] contributions we shall do contributions

[3:25:15] 13
[3:25:17] okay I pray you
[3:25:20] listen and behold two of them went the
[3:25:23] same day to a village called ous which
[3:25:26] was from Jerusalem about three score
[3:25:30] fongs and they talked together of all
[3:25:33] the things which had
[3:25:35] happened and it came to pass that while
[3:25:38] they communed together and
[3:25:41] reasoned Jesus himself Drew n and went
[3:25:45] with them
[3:25:46] but their eyes were Holden that they
[3:25:49] should not know him and he said unto
[3:25:52] them what manner of communications are
[3:25:55] these that you have one to another as
[3:25:57] you walk and Asser and one of them whose
[3:26:01] name was cleopas answering said unto him
[3:26:04] at TH only a stranger in Jerusalem and
[3:26:07] has not known the things which are come
[3:26:09] to pass here in these
[3:26:11] days and he said unto them what things
[3:26:14] and they said unto him concerning Jesus
[3:26:17] of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty
[3:26:20] indeed and before before God and all the
[3:26:24] people and how the chief priests and
[3:26:26] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[3:26:29] death and have crucified him but we
[3:26:32] trusted that it had been he which should
[3:26:35] have redeemed Israel and beside all this
[3:26:39] today is the third day since these
[3:26:41] things were
[3:26:42] done yeah and certain women also of our
[3:26:45] company made us astonished which were
[3:26:49] early at the sculpture and when they
[3:26:52] found not his body they came saying that
[3:26:55] they should have also seen in a vision
[3:26:57] of angels which say that he was
[3:27:00] alive and certain of them which were
[3:27:03] with us went to the sculpture and found
[3:27:06] it even so as women had said but him
[3:27:10] they saw
[3:27:11] not then he said unto them oh fools slow
[3:27:15] of heart believe all the prophets have
[3:27:18] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[3:27:21] these things and entered into his glory
[3:27:24] and beginning at Moses and all the
[3:27:26] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[3:27:29] the scriptures the things concerning
[3:27:31] himself and they drew nigh unto the
[3:27:35] village with they went and he made as
[3:27:38] though he would have gone
[3:27:39] farther they constrained him saying
[3:27:42] abide with us for it is toward evening
[3:27:45] and the day is first spent and he went
[3:27:48] into t with
[3:27:50] them and it came to pass as he sat at
[3:27:53] meat with them he took bread and blessed
[3:27:56] it and break and gave to
[3:27:58] them and their eyes were opened and they
[3:28:01] knew him and he vanished out of their
[3:28:04] sight and he said one to another did not
[3:28:08] our heart burn within us while he talked
[3:28:11] with us by the way and while he opened
[3:28:13] to us the
[3:28:14] scriptures and they arose up the same
[3:28:17] hour and returned to Jerusalem and found
[3:28:20] the 11 gathered together and them that
[3:28:22] were with them saying the Lord is risen
[3:28:26] indeed and has appeared to Simon and
[3:28:30] they told what things were done in the
[3:28:32] way and how he was known of them in
[3:28:35] Breaking Bread may God bless
