[19:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to thank you for this
[19:12] evening.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Grace that you've given unto us to come
[19:16] into your presence.
[19:19] You told us in your word
[19:22] that where two or three are gathered in
[19:24] your name,
[19:27] there in their midst.
[19:29] Father, we believe you are here in our

[19:53] and will be done
[19:56] pray may reveal yourself to us
[20:00] and even manifesting yourself to us
[20:03] that Lord you may help us father
[20:06] to run this race with patience
[20:11] unto Jesus the author and finish of our
[20:13] faith
[20:16] you Lord and we thank you Lord and bless
[20:19] your holy name in the name of the Lord
[20:22] Jesus Christ we pray
[20:25] amen I greet in the name of our Lord
[20:27] Jesus Christ
[20:30] &gt;&gt; I beg we go to John chapter
[20:32] 6.
[20:34] We're reading from verse 31 to verse 35.
[20:39] [Music]
[20:43] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[20:46] the Bible says,
[20:49] "Our fathers did eat mana in the desert,
[20:52] as it is written, he gave them bread
[20:55] from heaven to eat.
[21:07] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say
[21:11] unto you, Moses gave not that bread from
[21:16] heaven, but my father giveth you the
[21:20] true bread from heaven.
[21:35] For the bread of God is he which cometh
[21:39] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[21:42] the world.
[21:53] Then say to him, "Lord, ever more give
[21:57] us this bread.
[22:08] I am the bread of life. He that cometh
[22:13] to me shall never hunger, and he that
[22:16] believeth on me shall never thirst.
[22:30] May God sing of his word.
[22:34] I want to preach on the subject
[22:37] in verse 34.
[22:40] They told the Lord
[22:43] ever more this bread.
[22:47] So I want to talk about ever more give
[22:49] us this bread.
[22:53] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[22:55] know ever more
[22:58] means that all the time.
[23:01] Praise the name of our Lord. All the
[23:04] time give us this bread.
[23:07] And then Jesus tells them
[23:10] I am the bread of life
[23:14] personal pronoun.
[23:20] I am
[23:22] the bread of life.
[23:26] And then when he tells them that I am
[23:29] the bread of life,
[23:32] then he introduces to them
[23:35] how they can partake of that I am the
[23:38] bread.
[23:42] So he says in verse 35,
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto them,
[23:48] &gt;&gt; I am the bread of life,
[23:52] he that cometh to me shall never hunger.
[23:59] And he that believeth on me shall never
[24:02] thirst.
[24:05] So he says he that cometh
[24:10] and cometh
[24:12] means that it's continuous.
[24:17] You know you are going to him all the
[24:19] time.
[24:21] You're not going to him only once.
[24:24] And then he says he that believeth
[24:29] so now when you come
[24:32] you need also to believe.
[24:35] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[24:37] come, you also need to believe.
[24:41] And you know, so he says it has to be a
[24:44] continuous
[24:45] communion,
[24:50] you know, continuously,
[24:53] not only on Sunday when I'm at church,
[24:58] not only in the morning when I'm praying
[25:00] or reading my scriptures.
[25:04] But this is something that should be
[25:06] continuous
[25:09] that you know as I've started in the
[25:11] morning
[25:13] you know just seeking the Lord.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; So even through the course of the day
[25:21] you know I need to see that I'm seeking
[25:23] the Lord
[25:26] even through the week.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Not only when I'm with the people who
[25:30] know me.
[25:33] So I do behave well because they know
[25:36] I'm a Christian.
[25:40] But even the people who don't know me,
[25:44] I should be in continuous fellowship
[25:47] with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[25:51] So they were asking him
[25:54] even more
[25:56] give us this bread.
[25:59] And then Jesus identified himself
[26:03] &gt;&gt; as the bread
[26:06] as the living bread.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Now the
[26:12] other bread that Moses gave them
[26:16] which was manner that they were
[26:17] referring to before the Lord
[26:22] was falling every day.
[26:25] They would wake up in the morning and
[26:28] then they find that the bread the mana
[26:31] is on the earth
[26:34] and then they were asking what is this?
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is the bread and then they
[26:39] would collect as much as they wanted.
[26:46] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[26:48] they would grind it.
[26:50] grinding it or make it into different
[26:53] kind of meals or cakes or what?
[26:58] Praise the name of our Lord. So, but
[27:00] then that bread would only last that
[27:03] day.
[27:05] They needed
[27:07] on a daily basis
[27:10] to receive
[27:12] bread for their life.
[27:16] Praise the name of that was for natural
[27:19] life.
[27:21] So Jesus tells them, "All your fathers
[27:24] are dead.
[27:27] But then the bread that I give
[27:31] is the bread of life,
[27:34] praise the name of our Lord." Now in the
[27:36] message the Philian church age,
[27:40] brother Brennham says,
[27:43] &gt;&gt; he says,
[27:45] "Take the example now of mana from
[27:47] heaven.
[27:50] God sent down angel bread from heaven
[27:53] for Israel.
[27:59] But that bread did not satisfy.
[28:04] It was only good for a day.
[28:10] Those who ate it were hungry again the
[28:12] next day.
[28:16] If it was left around,
[28:19] It became contaminated.
[28:23] But Jesus
[28:25] is the true bread
[28:29] where of man was just a type.
[28:34] And if a man eats of that bread that
[28:36] came down from heaven,
[28:41] he will never hunger again.
[28:45] He does not to come back again.
[28:51] The moment he partake,
[28:55] he had eternal life.
[28:58] Here indeed was reality.
[29:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So now
[29:06] Jesus is the true bread
[29:10] because bread is meant to give us life.
[29:15] But then the natural bread
[29:19] only give you natural life.
[29:23] Praise the name of like just in the
[29:26] scriptures.
[29:28] When we go to Psalms 104
[29:31] [Music]
[29:33] and then verse 15,
[29:36] &gt;&gt; the Bible says,
[29:38] "And wine that makes glad the heart of
[29:41] man,
[29:43] and oil to make his face to shine, and
[29:46] bread which strengthens man's heart."
[29:51] Psalms 104 verse1 15.
[30:17] They become excited
[30:20] all the time laughing around.
[30:24] There is some form of gladness the wine
[30:26] or alcohol they have taken.
[30:30] Some of them drink to forget the problem
[30:32] they have.
[30:35] Now that's the natural part.
[30:37] And then he says when you get oil
[30:41] or vaseline and then you smear your face
[30:46] then your face shines
[30:50] it becomes attractive.
[30:53] And then he says but when you eat the
[30:56] bread
[30:58] the bread
[31:00] strengthens your heart.
[31:04] It strengthens.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; It gives strength
[31:10] to your heart. Now that is the natural
[31:13] bread.
[31:14] Now how about the spiritual bread?
[31:18] If the natural bread can give a man's
[31:22] heart strength,
[31:25] you make a decision now I can go and do
[31:28] this kind of work.
[31:31] Because you make decisions by your
[31:33] heart.
[31:34] I think let me walk this journey.
[31:37] Let me climb this mountain.
[31:40] Let me do this kind of task.
[31:43] All the decisions come from the heart.
[31:47] And the heart will decide that I'm not
[31:49] able to do that kind of job.
[31:54] I can't finish this task of the work
[31:56] today.
[31:57] And now when you eat you feel more
[31:59] strength and say let let us continue
[32:00] now.
[32:04] How about the spiritual bread?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; If we can receive the spiritual bread,
[32:12] how much will it give us strength to run
[32:14] this race?
[32:18] Praise the name of our Lord. The Jews
[32:20] were telling Jesus Christ,
[32:23] "ever more Lord,
[32:26] give us this bread."
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And our
[32:31] Lord Jesus Christ
[32:34] is that true bread that came from
[32:36] heaven.
[32:38] Praise the name of our Lord. And we need
[32:40] to see that we desire that true bread in
[32:42] our lives.
[32:46] Lord, give me of this bread that I may
[32:48] eat.
[32:51] Feed me more, Lord. Give me more.
[32:54] Because the Bible says when we go to
[32:57] Matthew chapter 4,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus was hungry.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Satan told him, "You turn those stones
[33:05] into bread."
[33:08] And then Jesus told Satan,
[33:11] "Man shall not live by bread alone,
[33:15] &gt;&gt; but by every word.
[33:20] that comes out of the mouth of God
[33:23] and proceeding.
[33:26] In other words, continuously
[33:30] you must hear the word of God.
[33:34] The true bread of God
[33:37] is the one which can give you life
[33:42] and can keep you alive before God.
[33:47] Praise the name of our Lord. So now you
[33:50] can examine yourself.
[33:52] How often
[33:55] do you attend to the word of God?
[33:59] How often do you hear the word of God?
[34:03] How often do you read the word of God?
[34:07] How often do you meditate upon the word
[34:09] of God?
[34:11] And yet God told Joshua
[34:15] the book of law
[34:19] shall not depart from you,
[34:22] but meditate upon it day and night.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; That's what says
[34:31] in Joshua chapter one.
[34:34] Praise the name of our Lord.
[34:37] Joshua chapter one
[34:42] and then we can read from verse six.
[34:45] God.
[34:50] He says,
[34:54] "Be strong and of good courage, for unto
[34:57] these people shall you divide for an
[34:59] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[35:03] their fathers to give them.
[35:16] So God is giving Joshua a promise
[35:21] that you are the one going to make this
[35:23] people inherit the land.
[35:28] But that would not come anyhow.
[35:32] God was giving Joshua guidance.
[35:36] I will be able to do it.
[35:40] He said, "Be strong
[35:42] and of a good courage
[35:46] for you to divide the land to the
[35:48] people,
[35:51] you may be strong
[35:54] and of good courage."
[35:56] And then he tells him, "Only be strong
[35:59] and very courageous
[36:03] that you may observe to do according to
[36:06] all the law.
[36:11] So now the obedience of the law
[36:16] is the one that gave Joshua strength and
[36:18] courage.
[36:22] Praise the name of the Lord to do the
[36:24] will of God.
[36:27] Just as the natural food
[36:30] gives you natural strength,
[36:33] it gives your heart natural strength
[36:37] to resolve to do things.
[36:40] Praise the name of the Lord. Even the
[36:43] word of God
[36:45] gives us that spiritual strength
[36:49] to be able to do the will of God.
[36:53] Praise the name of the Lord. You cannot
[36:55] be able to do the will of God
[36:59] if you don't yield yourself to the word
[37:01] of God.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So you need
[37:06] to learn that you need the word of God
[37:08] on a daily basis.
[37:13] You need to yield yourself
[37:16] to the word of God,
[37:19] obedient to the word of God.
[37:22] Like God was telling Joshua, Observe
[37:26] all the law
[37:29] which I commanded Moses
[37:32] and turn not from the right hand or to
[37:34] the left hand
[37:44] that you may prosper wherever you go.
[37:51] This book of the Lord shall not depart
[37:54] out of your mouth,
[37:57] but you shall meditate there in day and
[37:59] night,
[38:02] that you may observe
[38:06] to do according to all that is written
[38:09] in the law.
[38:13] Then when you do that,
[38:16] then all your ways shall be prosperous
[38:23] and you shall be successful.
[38:27] See how the Lord defines success.
[38:30] See how the Lord defines to be
[38:32] prosperous.
[38:37] Take time in the word.
[38:40] Praise the name of our Lord. reading the
[38:42] word, hearing the word, meditate upon
[38:46] that word,
[38:48] obey that word, then he says you're
[38:51] going to be successful.
[38:54] You are going to be s, you know, you're
[38:55] going to do the will of the Lord.
[38:58] And that's what Jesus was saying. You
[39:00] don't live by bread alone,
[39:03] but by every word.
[39:07] So you need to desire to hear God.
[39:12] The Lord Jesus says when they told him,
[39:16] Lord, ever more
[39:19] give us this bread. Then he told them
[39:23] just come to me and when you come to me,
[39:27] believe me. So now coming and believing,
[39:32] you are receiving the bread of life.
[39:35] Praise the name of our Lord. It should
[39:37] not only be on Sunday when you in church
[39:41] or not only be this evening when we are
[39:42] in church
[39:45] but even tomorrow you know you desire
[39:48] Lord once more Lord I need ever more of
[39:52] your word
[39:54] and you know the Bible says that the
[39:57] word of God
[39:59] let us go and pick that from Psalms 19.
[40:04] Praise the name of our Lord.
[40:07] Psalms chapter 19
[40:11] and then we pick this verse
[40:17] verse seven.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. It says the
[40:23] law of the Lord is perfect.
[40:31] What does it do when it is perfect?
[40:35] converts the soul.
[40:38] In other words, you are changed.
[40:42] So he says the law is perfect.
[40:45] It converts the soul.
[40:48] You want your soul to be converted.
[40:51] Praise the name of our Lord. Get to the
[40:54] word of God.
[40:56] Let the word of God take charge over
[40:57] your life.
[41:00] Take interest in the word of the Lord.
[41:04] Praise the name of our Lord.
[41:07] Are sleeping at this time. If you come
[41:09] to church, don't sleep.
[41:13] Stand up if you're sleeping.
[41:16] Praise the name of our Lord. So the
[41:18] Bible says the law of the Lord is
[41:22] perfect.
[41:24] So now it converts the soul.
[41:28] You know it converts, it changes the
[41:30] soul.
[41:34] And then he says,
[41:36] "The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[41:43] making wise
[41:45] the simple.
[41:51] The statutes of the Lord are right,
[41:57] rejoicing the heart.
[42:01] Praise the name of our Lord. The
[42:03] statutes of the Lord,
[42:06] you know, they rejoice the heart.
[42:10] The statutes of the Lord
[42:12] are right.
[42:14] Now, when you are receiving the bread,
[42:18] praise the name of the Lord. You're not
[42:20] going to be annoyed.
[42:23] There is an excitement when you are
[42:25] going to eat
[42:28] you know because maybe you have been
[42:30] waiting for some time
[42:32] but the true bread from heaven
[42:36] you know it rejoices the heart
[42:39] it converts the heart
[42:42] that's the true bread
[42:45] he says even more Lord
[42:48] &gt;&gt; give us this bread
[42:51] &gt;&gt; and right Now we are receiving that
[42:54] bread.
[42:55] Praise the name of our Lord. You should
[42:57] be in position to bring joy in your
[42:59] heart.
[43:01] He should be able to strengthen you.
[43:05] If you are discouraged in life,
[43:08] if you are frustrated in life,
[43:12] the bread from heaven
[43:14] gives you that joy,
[43:17] gives you that peace
[43:20] gives you, you know, that kind of, you
[43:22] know, blessing that the Lord gives you.
[43:26] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[43:28] desire that bread.
[43:30] And it's without money, without price.
[43:34] Praise the name of our Lord without
[43:36] money, without price.
[43:40] Praise the name of our Lord. And then he
[43:42] says,
[43:43] &gt;&gt; the commandment of the Lord is pure.
[43:49] The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[43:54] enlightening the eyes.
[43:59] Stop sleeping.
[44:04] The commandment of the Lord
[44:09] is pure,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; enlightening the eyes.
[44:17] So you know when you hear the
[44:19] commandment of God,
[44:21] it enlightens the eye.
[44:25] In other words, you are able to look at
[44:27] things.
[44:29] You are able to make decisions.
[44:32] You are able to discern things.
[44:37] This is in the mind of God.
[44:40] Praise the name of our Lord. It
[44:42] enlightens your eye.
[44:45] And then the Bible says, "The fear of
[44:48] the Lord is clean,
[44:51] enduring forever.
[44:55] The judgments of the Lord are true and
[44:57] righteous all together.
[45:00] And then he says in summary,
[45:04] they are more to be desired.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Okay.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Much more than fine gold.
[45:25] Like when you are moving on that road
[45:28] from through
[45:32] and then you reach the district of
[45:36] you get men and women and children
[45:41] all of them full of soil.
[45:44] They are going down to dig soils.
[45:48] Then they kind of save it. Others are
[45:51] washing it in water.
[45:54] Others are grinding it.
[45:57] What are they looking for? Gold.
[46:02] Now if those people looking for the
[46:03] natural gold can labor like that
[46:08] perishes,
[46:10] but then the Bible is telling us
[46:13] that the word of God
[46:16] is more to be desired
[46:20] than that gold.
[46:22] Now for them they are looking for
[46:25] unrefined gold. That's where they
[46:26] laboring
[46:29] which is having soil and everything
[46:35] because they are small pieces which they
[46:36] keep on receiving.
[46:41] You can imagine a whole ton of soy.
[46:50] You are only going to get something like
[46:52] 10 g.
[46:57] Yeah, that's the thing. And that rate
[46:58] there is good enough
[47:02] that soil has a lot of gold if it has
[47:04] only 10 g or 12 g in one t.
[47:10] Praise the name of our Lord. But people
[47:12] are looking for it.
[47:15] But then the Bible says even more
[47:17] desired than fine gold.
[47:23] Fine gold.
[47:31] You know fine God is the one which is
[47:33] ready to sell which has already been
[47:35] processed
[47:38] and they get 99.9%.
[47:46] That's how pure it is. But then the
[47:49] Bible says you desire the word of God
[47:55] more than that God. And then he says
[47:59] sweeter also than honey and honeycomb.
[48:04] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[48:07] imagine how precious the word of God
[48:09] should be to us.
[48:13] So they said ever more Lord
[48:16] give us of this bread. Praise the name
[48:19] of our Lord. So that should always be
[48:21] our desire.
[48:24] You know when you desire the word of
[48:26] God,
[48:28] it rejoices your heart.
[48:31] It changes your thinking.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; The way you look at things also changes.
[48:38] If you have been bound in a particular
[48:40] situation,
[48:42] that situation you were delivered from
[48:44] it.
[48:46] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[48:48] the word of God should be to our lives.
[48:52] So we should take it serious
[48:55] that when the Lord gives us an
[48:56] opportunity
[48:59] when he's speaking to us
[49:02] when he told them
[49:04] I have this living bread
[49:07] when they desired
[49:10] Lord ever more give us this bread.
[49:14] Praise the name of our Lord. They were
[49:16] you know they are coming to the Lord
[49:18] Jesus Christ.
[49:21] they were coming for the natural bread.
[49:26] You know when Jesus had had made had
[49:29] broken bread
[49:31] and then he fed them
[49:34] then they said we need to go to his
[49:36] meetings because we are going to eat
[49:38] food
[49:41] and they wanted to force Jesus Christ to
[49:43] be their king.
[49:47] They wanted to force him
[49:50] to make him a king because as a king
[49:54] he would make free bread.
[49:57] So there's no need of laboring
[50:00] and going to buy
[50:04] as a king. He would heal them.
[50:08] So no need of troubling you know it was
[50:10] like the time of Moses.
[50:16] He would give protection to them.
[50:19] So now they kept on looking for the
[50:21] Lord.
[50:23] Let us go to John chapter 6.
[50:35] [Music]
[50:51] verse 15.
[50:54] Okay, let us start from verse 14.
[50:59] Then this those men when they had seen
[51:02] the miracle that Jesus did said this is
[51:06] of a truth that prophet that should come
[51:09] into the world.
[51:17] When Jesus therefore perceived that they
[51:20] would come and take him by force to make
[51:23] him a king, he departed again into the
[51:26] mountain himself alone.
[51:31] [Music]
[51:37] So wherever they were hearing that Jesus
[51:39] is
[51:41] they would cross the sea.
[51:43] Now when they reach this place he's not
[51:46] there. Then they start wondering where
[51:49] is he? I saw him go to the mountain.
[51:53] Then they try to see where he goes.
[51:56] They took time looking for him
[52:00] and then they would go in different
[52:02] places
[52:04] trying to look for him wherever he went.
[52:09] So the Bible says
[52:11] &gt;&gt; in verse 19,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; so when they had rode
[52:16] about, okay, let us jump that and then
[52:19] verse 21, 22, the day following, when
[52:22] the people which stood on the other side
[52:25] of the sea, so that there was none other
[52:28] boat there, save the one which were in
[52:30] into his disciples were entered. And
[52:32] Jesus went not with the disciples into
[52:34] the boat, but that his disciples were
[52:36] gone away alone.
[52:39] [Music]
[52:56] Verse number.
[52:59] [Music]
[53:14] Verse 24. When the people therefore saw
[53:16] that Jesus was not there, you know, they
[53:19] kept on looking for him everywhere.
[53:25] And then the Bible says, when they saw
[53:27] he was not there,
[53:30] neither his disciples,
[53:32] they took also shipping.
[53:37] and came to Capernaam seeking for Jesus.
[53:48] And when they found him on the other
[53:51] side of the sea, they said unto him,
[53:54] "Rabbi,
[53:55] hey, when did you come here?"
[54:03] Praise the name of our Lord.
[54:05] But why were they looking for Jesus?
[54:08] Because they ate
[54:11] &gt;&gt; and they were full.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And you know there are some of those
[54:16] churches, denominations you go to.
[54:21] When you go to preach,
[54:23] they will ask you what have you brought
[54:24] for us.
[54:27] They are somewhere used to being given.
[54:32] So brings them to the churches.
[54:36] Then those who are used to being being
[54:38] given books for going to school
[54:43] for those things
[54:46] but not really the life
[54:49] their life to be changed. So even this
[54:52] wanted to force Jesus to be the king
[54:56] because he was giving them free bread.
[54:59] They were tired of paying taxes.
[55:02] They were tired of going to the gardens.
[55:05] We better get this man as our king.
[55:10] And then the Bible says, "And when they
[55:13] had phone, he said, where how did you
[55:16] come here?"
[55:20] Then Jesus said to them,
[55:23] I say unto you,
[55:26] you seek me not because you saw the
[55:29] miracles.
[55:32] because you did eat of the loaves
[55:37] and were filled.
[55:39] So what is your intent of coming to God?
[55:45] Is it for denial of bread
[55:49] or you come to church
[55:51] because your father comes to church
[55:55] or your mother comes to church
[55:58] and you have not known the essence of
[56:00] coming to church as an individual.
[56:04] You are following your father's
[56:06] religion.
[56:08] You are following your mother's
[56:09] religion.
[56:12] you're following, you know, your your
[56:13] your your friend's religion.
[56:18] Why do you come before the Lord?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; This came because they were filled with
[56:24] bread.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus tells them,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; "Labor not for the meat which perishes."
[56:35] Verse 27,
[56:41] But for the meat which endures unto
[56:44] everlasting life,
[56:51] which the Son of Man shall give unto
[56:53] you,
[56:56] for him has God the Father sealed.
[57:04] Now when we go to our fields
[57:07] or when we go to work,
[57:10] you know, you are working to get food.
[57:13] But then he says,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; labor not
[57:18] for the things that perish.
[57:22] Now he says, "Labor for the meat that
[57:25] endures unto eternal life."
[57:32] Now let us look at this meat.
[57:36] Praise the name of the Lord. He says,
[57:38] "Labor not for the meat that perishes."
[57:44] That's where we spend most of our time,
[57:47] the whole day until God has no room in
[57:50] your program.
[57:55] He has no space.
[57:58] The way Jesus didn't have an in
[58:02] where he would be born from and many
[58:05] times we also congest our programs
[58:11] evening. You only think about God when
[58:14] you are too exhausted.
[58:18] You only think about God at last.
[58:24] When you are spending,
[58:27] when you are spending, you think about
[58:30] God last
[58:33] the the the old coins,
[58:36] the old notes,
[58:39] you know, those balances of maybe
[58:43] either something you've bought
[58:47] is what you say. Now this one belongs to
[58:48] the Lord.
[58:51] When you are exhausted,
[58:55] that's when you think about the Lord.
[58:58] A very bad attitude as these people were
[59:00] displaying.
[59:03] So now in John chapter 4,
[59:06] praise the name of our Lord.
[59:10] John chapter 4 and then verse 31.
[59:14] Now Jesus here had gone to the well.
[59:19] And then the disciples had gone to buy
[59:21] meat.
[59:24] And while they were away,
[59:27] Jesus was interacting with the woman at
[59:29] the well.
[59:32] And then he told her, "Go and bring your
[59:34] husband."
[59:36] And then she went to the city to give a
[59:38] testimony.
[59:41] Come and see this man.
[59:44] Isn't this the Messiah? So now when the
[59:46] disciples came
[59:49] and the food was ready,
[59:52] they tell Jesus in John 4:31,
[59:58] "In the meantime, while his disciples
[1:00:00] prayed him, saying, "Master, eat."
[1:00:10] But he said unto them,
[1:00:13] I have meat to eat and you know not of.
[1:00:21] Therefore said the disciples one to
[1:00:23] another
[1:00:28] has any man brought him out to eat.
[1:00:35] goes to the natural thing.
[1:00:40] But Jesus said unto them,
[1:00:43] "My meat
[1:00:45] is to do the will of him that sent me
[1:00:51] and finish his work."
[1:00:54] That's the meat he's talking about.
[1:00:57] Doing the will of God.
[1:01:00] How often do you do the will of God in
[1:01:02] your life?
[1:01:06] You need to examine yourself.
[1:01:08] How often do I do the will of the Lord?
[1:01:12] How often do I seek to do the will of
[1:01:14] God?
[1:01:16] How often do I seek to do that which
[1:01:19] pleases the Lord?
[1:01:23] And doing the will of God,
[1:01:26] Jesus calls it meat
[1:01:30] because it involved him.
[1:01:33] It took all his mind.
[1:01:36] What takes your mind?
[1:01:39] What takes your time?
[1:01:42] What occupies you?
[1:01:46] There are people on the day.
[1:01:49] You know they came to the Lord.
[1:01:52] They will come to the Lord and say,
[1:01:54] "I've spoken in tongue.
[1:01:57] I've done great things." And then he
[1:02:00] said, "I don't know you.
[1:02:03] Go away from me, you workers of
[1:02:05] iniquity.
[1:02:09] Now he said he rejected them
[1:02:14] because they never did the will of God.
[1:02:19] So now we need to see that we seek the
[1:02:21] will of God for our lives.
[1:02:25] We need to see that we do the will of
[1:02:27] God.
[1:02:29] Because when you are doing the will of
[1:02:31] God,
[1:02:33] you are fulfilling his purpose.
[1:02:38] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:02:40] message,
[1:02:42] let me pick it up here.
[1:02:46] It's in the church age book.
[1:02:51] The pagan church age.
[1:02:54] He says those in the bride do only his
[1:02:58] will.
[1:03:02] No one can make them do otherwise.
[1:03:08] They thus they have thus says the Lord
[1:03:13] or they keep still.
[1:03:17] They know that it has to be God in them
[1:03:23] doing the works,
[1:03:25] fulfilling his word.
[1:03:28] He did not complete all his work while
[1:03:31] in his earthly ministry.
[1:03:38] So now he works in and through the
[1:03:40] bride.
[1:03:44] She knows that
[1:03:46] For it was not yet time for him to do
[1:03:49] certain things
[1:03:53] that he must now do,
[1:03:57] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:03:59] bride
[1:04:02] that work which he left for this
[1:04:04] specific time.
[1:04:08] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:04:10] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:13] will always seek to do the will of God
[1:04:19] and that should always be our heart's
[1:04:21] desire.
[1:04:24] Lord I desire to do your will.
[1:04:28] As God reveals you his will
[1:04:32] do that. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:04:35] And as you keep on doing,
[1:04:38] he keeps on bringing more, keeps on
[1:04:41] giving. But if you have rejected the
[1:04:44] food that has been given to you,
[1:04:48] if you have you're disobedient to the
[1:04:50] little, you know,
[1:04:53] how do you expect to be given much?
[1:04:57] If you're not faithful in the little,
[1:05:01] how do you expect much?
[1:05:04] So if we is going to give us more,
[1:05:09] let us rejoice with the little that is
[1:05:10] always giving us.
[1:05:13] Praise the name of our Lord. Just
[1:05:16] rejoice with that little he has given
[1:05:18] you.
[1:05:20] Take it serious in your life. Be
[1:05:23] obedient.
[1:05:24] Be like the other who was coming from
[1:05:26] Ethiopia.
[1:05:30] He was reading the scroll of Isaiah.
[1:05:34] And then he was wondering what it meant,
[1:05:38] but he was reading it aloud.
[1:05:41] He didn't know much what it meant.
[1:05:44] But God had to send Philillip.
[1:05:48] And then Philip revealed to him what it
[1:05:50] meant.
[1:05:53] He was faithful in the little that was
[1:05:56] given to him.
[1:05:59] given us. We need to be faithful to that
[1:06:01] which has been given to us.
[1:06:04] The Lord will keep on adding
[1:06:08] adding. This little that we have
[1:06:12] will create room for more.
[1:06:16] He keeps on giving you. He keeps on
[1:06:19] giving you. He keeps on supplying.
[1:06:23] Praise the name of the Lord. In the
[1:06:25] Simon church age,
[1:06:28] he says,
[1:06:31] "No true believer
[1:06:34] is any stronger
[1:06:37] and spiritually healthy
[1:06:41] and alive
[1:06:43] than his knowledge
[1:06:49] and adurance to the pure word of God.
[1:06:54] So now as the Lord makes the word known
[1:06:57] to us,
[1:07:02] the more we get to know the word of God
[1:07:06] is the more we are expected to be
[1:07:08] obedient to the word of God.
[1:07:15] Now the more you are obedient to the
[1:07:16] word of God
[1:07:19] and then you become stronger,
[1:07:23] you become healthier
[1:07:27] and then he keeps on revealing more to
[1:07:29] you.
[1:07:32] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:07:35] no true believer
[1:07:38] is any strong and spiritually healthy
[1:07:43] and alive.
[1:07:45] than his knowledge of
[1:07:49] and adurance to the pure word of God
[1:07:54] as said by mult of examples in the Old
[1:07:57] Testament.
[1:08:02] Organization was growing a pace
[1:08:10] confirming and augmenting the death of
[1:08:12] the membership.
[1:08:20] For the Holy Ghost leadership was
[1:08:22] disposed
[1:08:28] and the word was replaced by creeds,
[1:08:31] dogmas and man-made rituals.
[1:08:40] So it was death.
[1:08:42] So that's why we need to take interest
[1:08:45] in the word of God.
[1:08:48] As he gives us,
[1:08:51] let us receive it.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And we just
[1:08:54] say, Lord, ever more.
[1:08:58] What he gives us today, let us rejoice
[1:09:01] for that. Let us be obedient in that.
[1:09:05] Let us walk in the light of that. And he
[1:09:08] keeps on adding. Keeps on adding. keeps
[1:09:11] on adding. You know, it is just like,
[1:09:14] you know, you are walking a journey.
[1:09:18] The Bible says the word of God is a lamp
[1:09:23] to our feet.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; You need the lamp
[1:09:29] to see where you're putting the next
[1:09:30] step.
[1:09:33] Now, if you fail to take the next step,
[1:09:38] how are you going to reach the
[1:09:39] destination?
[1:09:41] you can't work out. So eat the same
[1:09:44] thing with food.
[1:09:46] You refuse to eat today.
[1:09:49] How are you going to reach tomorrow?
[1:09:53] But you need that daily bread.
[1:09:57] You need God to keep on adding to you,
[1:10:01] giving you more, giving you more as you
[1:10:06] keep on growing.
[1:10:08] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:10:11] Then in this message,
[1:10:16] the church of Simmon
[1:10:19] says in the Ephesian age
[1:10:23] and in this age and in every age
[1:10:28] we contemplate, we will see that this is
[1:10:31] true.
[1:10:34] And in the last age,
[1:10:37] which is our age,
[1:10:40] we will find
[1:10:42] the blackout of the word.
[1:10:48] The complete apostasy ending in the
[1:10:51] great tribulation
[1:10:53] of them.
[1:10:58] ending in the great tribulation.
[1:11:05] If you are true seed,
[1:11:10] if you are a true seed,
[1:11:13] if you are truly baptized with the Holy
[1:11:16] Ghost,
[1:11:18] you will esteem his word
[1:11:28] above your necessary meat.
[1:11:34] and the young to live by every word
[1:11:40] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:11:47] if you are true seed
[1:11:51] and you have truly been baptized with
[1:11:53] the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:56] you desire the word of God
[1:12:00] above your daily food.
[1:12:04] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:12:06] would yearn
[1:12:09] to live by every word
[1:12:14] that comes out of the mouth of God.
[1:12:18] Praise the name of our Lord. So that
[1:12:20] should always be your desire every day.
[1:12:23] Lord, you have revealed this to me.
[1:12:27] Let me be obedient to it.
[1:12:30] Praise the name of our Lord. So that's
[1:12:32] how you keep on receiving more from the
[1:12:34] Lord.
[1:12:37] It is a continuous communion.
[1:12:43] You keep on communing with him.
[1:12:47] Then he says, "This is my honest prayer
[1:12:50] for all of us.
[1:12:53] May we hear what the spirit is bringing
[1:12:56] from the word for us today.
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] Praise the name of our Lord. So you need
[1:13:04] to see that you desire more of God.
[1:13:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And as you
[1:13:10] receive that word,
[1:13:14] praise the name of our Lord. It gives
[1:13:16] you strength.
[1:13:18] Praise the name of our Lord. It
[1:13:20] strengthens you. It encourages you.
[1:13:24] It helps you in need.
[1:13:27] and it keeps on multiplying.
[1:13:31] Praise the name of our Lord. Any seed
[1:13:34] that is true
[1:13:36] will always multiply.
[1:13:39] So you receive the word, you rejoice for
[1:13:42] that word
[1:13:44] like when
[1:13:48] he got that revelation
[1:13:50] and he said you are the son of the
[1:13:53] living God.
[1:13:56] Jesus said
[1:13:58] from now the door of heaven will be open
[1:14:01] to you
[1:14:03] and then the angels will be coming. You
[1:14:06] will see revelation upon revelation.
[1:14:11] Praise the name of our Lord. We need to
[1:14:13] desire more of God in our life.
[1:14:17] More of the Lord.
[1:14:19] Take time read your Bible.
[1:14:22] Take time read the message book.
[1:14:25] Take time. Be obedient to these things
[1:14:28] and then you'll see how these things
[1:14:29] will mold your life.
[1:14:32] How they will change your thinking,
[1:14:37] how they will help you overcome your
[1:14:39] weaknesses.
[1:14:41] You had the other weakness. You had the
[1:14:44] other weakness and they keep on changing
[1:14:47] you, washing you, changing your
[1:14:51] perspective of things.
[1:14:54] The Bible says it enlightens your eyes.
[1:14:59] It keeps on cutting things away from
[1:15:01] you.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; It sanctifies you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You are no
[1:15:09] longer desiring to go to the discourse.
[1:15:13] Even when you get, you know, those
[1:15:15] journals or those kind of magazines,
[1:15:20] you don't want to know what's going to
[1:15:21] happen over the weekend.
[1:15:25] What's going to be at this club? What's
[1:15:27] going to be here?
[1:15:29] You no longer take interest in those
[1:15:31] things.
[1:15:34] You have already been cut off from all
[1:15:36] those wicked things.
[1:15:39] You only need to say, Lord, I need more
[1:15:41] of you in my life.
[1:15:44] My desire is you to come down in my
[1:15:47] life. Praise the name of the Lord. That
[1:15:50] should be a genuine desire for each and
[1:15:51] everyone.
[1:15:54] When we at home,
[1:15:56] you desire more of God. When you at your
[1:15:59] place of work, desire more of God. When
[1:16:03] you're at school, desire more of God.
[1:16:07] That we can be in continuous communion
[1:16:13] with the Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the
[1:16:15] name of our Lord. Ever more.
[1:16:19] Give us this bread. And he has already
[1:16:22] given unto us. But what he has given to
[1:16:24] us,
[1:16:26] are we rejoicing over it?
[1:16:29] Praise the name of our Lord. Like the
[1:16:31] Bible says,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; when he was walking with Cleopass,
[1:16:38] their hearts were
[1:16:40] kind of like held back,
[1:16:45] you know. They couldn't rejoice.
[1:16:49] They were sorrowful
[1:16:52] until he opened their eyes.
[1:16:56] Praise the name of our Lord. Now we in
[1:16:59] the presence of God. We need the Lord to
[1:17:01] open our eyes.
[1:17:04] We need the Lord to open our hearts.
[1:17:08] We need the Lord to open our ears
[1:17:11] that we may be able to receive what he's
[1:17:13] giving us.
[1:17:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Always
[1:17:17] desire more of God in your life.
[1:17:22] Amen. May God bless you.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:31] Let us sing that song. Jesus the light
[1:17:33] of the world.
[1:17:37] Praise the name of our Lord. I can stand
[1:17:39] up.
