[33:23] There is a
[33:26] there's a brother I think he has gone
[33:28] back. Brother Hillary he was around.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. You know last time when we had
[33:35] brother Tim do preaching
[33:40] and then he was preaching about you know
[33:43] I think it was about the birth talking
[33:45] about the spirit and the soul and then
[33:48] the body
[33:50] when was in November.
[33:53] Brother Hillary
[33:55] testified in the forum
[33:58] that he had never known the difference
[34:00] between the soul and the human spirit.
[34:06] and how they affect our relationship
[34:08] with God.
[34:10] But he says that sermon of brother Tim
[34:15] which opened all his eyes.
[34:18] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[34:20] sometimes you may keep on coming
[34:23] but there is always a day that the Lord
[34:26] can open your eyes to the reality.
[34:30] So just keep on coming
[34:32] you know like the unsapter
[34:36] 8 when he went to worship
[34:38] and he was coming back
[34:41] God sent Philillip
[34:43] praise the name of our Lord and he was
[34:45] busy reading his Bible.
[34:48] So even as we keep on reading our
[34:51] Bibles, we keep on reading our message
[34:53] books. Sometimes you may not understand
[34:56] the things but keep on being faithful,
[35:00] reading, meditating upon it, coming to
[35:04] the services. One day God can send
[35:06] Philillip to you
[35:08] who will bring these things plain to
[35:10] you.
[35:12] And these are our Philips amongst us.
[35:15] Praise the name of our Lord coming from
[35:17] a far land
[35:20] with a special message.
[35:22] open our eyes to some of these things we
[35:24] may not be able to understand.
[35:28] Praise the name of our Lord. So we're
[35:30] going to brother,
[35:32] &gt;&gt; let us sing that song. Redeemed how I
[35:35] love to proclaim it.

[39:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't lose one of them."
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's good good to be in the
[39:30] house of the Lord once again.
[39:35] Amen. Why don't we Why don't we just
[39:37] take our Bibles together
[39:40] and we want to turn to the book of John,
[39:42] chapter 14.
[40:03] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[40:06] believe in God, believe also in me.
[40:15] In my father's house are many mansions.
[40:18] If it were not so, I would have told
[40:21] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[40:35] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[40:38] I will come again and receive you unto
[40:41] myself. Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you may be also.
[40:57] and whether I whether I go you know and
[41:00] the way you know.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not
[41:08] whether thou goest, how can we know the
[41:10] way?
[41:20] Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the
[41:23] truth, and the life. No man cometh unto
[41:26] the Father but by me.
[41:38] Amen. Let's pray together.
[41:41] Blessed heavenly father,
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are just reaching out to you
[41:46] tonight.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, what what good would it do,
[41:52] Father,
[41:54] &gt;&gt; to try to stand here and and say
[41:57] anything without your spirit?
[42:01] The letter killth, but the spirit giveth
[42:04] life.
[42:06] Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you would come
[42:09] tonight.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Give us strength, Lord.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Give us your uncction, Lord Jesus.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; And Lord, as as you speak,
[42:23] may we open our mouth to allow you to
[42:26] speak through us, oh God.
[42:30] Open our hearts to hear your voice,
[42:32] Lord.
[42:35] Lord, we just commit this service to
[42:37] you.
[42:39] In Jesus precious name we pray.
[42:43] Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could have your seats.
[42:54] Jesus says,
[42:56] &gt;&gt; "I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[43:04] says, "If if I go to prepare a place for
[43:06] you,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; it wouldn't do no good for me to make
[43:11] you a place
[43:15] and then leave you down here."
[43:18] But he says, "If I go to prepare a place
[43:20] for you,
[43:24] I will come again
[43:27] &gt;&gt; and
[43:29] receive you to myself.
[43:33] that where I am
[43:35] &gt;&gt; there you may be also.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; He says where I am
[43:42] &gt;&gt; not where I go
[43:45] &gt;&gt; but that where I am
[43:48] there you may be also.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; So where where was he?
[43:55] while they were looking at him.
[43:58] He's saying, "Well, you're right here.
[44:01] We're already here with you.
[44:04] Where where else could we could we find
[44:06] you?"
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Where else would we go?"
[44:12] You alone have the words of eternal
[44:13] life.
[44:16] But there was something that they were
[44:18] missing,
[44:20] something that they didn't have access
[44:22] to.
[44:25] that Jesus had access to.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And he says where I am,
[44:31] I want you to be in that same place.
[44:34] [Music]
[44:35] The fellowship that I have with the
[44:37] father,
[44:40] I want you to come into that fellowship
[44:42] as well.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; So I need to go and finish the work
[44:48] so that you can come into fellowship.
[44:52] He says, "The way, you know,
[44:56] and where I'm going, you know."
[44:58] They said, "We don't know the way."
[45:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the way."
[45:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't Jesus wasn't saying, "You
[45:06] should already have it figured out."
[45:11] He says, "You know the way
[45:14] because you know me.
[45:16] You don't realize it,
[45:19] but you already know the way.
[45:23] You've been walking with the way.
[45:26] You've been talking with the way.
[45:29] You've been in fellowship with the way.
[45:33] And I must complete the way
[45:37] so that where I am, there you may also
[45:40] be.
[45:42] In John chapter 3,
[45:45] he says, "No man ascends up to heaven,
[45:51] but he that came down from heaven,
[45:55] even the son of man which is in heaven,"
[46:01] so there he was standing in their midst.
[46:05] But he was also in heaven.
[46:10] Amen. He was still connected to that
[46:12] place of fellowship.
[46:16] He was still connected to the place
[46:18] where God dwelt.
[46:22] There there was no no uh chasm between
[46:26] him and God.
[46:30] But he and God were one.
[46:35] And he's saying, "What I have now,
[46:39] you must also have the same thing."
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Right now, I am in heaven.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And I want you to also be in heaven.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Even though you are still on earth,
[46:57] you must be connected to heaven.
[47:02] And when he finished the work,
[47:05] he bridged the gap between heaven and
[47:07] earth
[47:10] that through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[47:14] we could be seated in heavenly places in
[47:17] heaven.
[47:20] [Applause]
[47:23] Therefore, we must walk after the spirit
[47:29] and not after the flesh.
[47:32] As long as we're walking in the flesh,
[47:35] this is what we see.
[47:37] We think, well, I'm not in heaven.
[47:41] I I all I see around me are my faults.
[47:46] I see this flesh,
[47:48] this mortal body
[47:51] that doesn't live the way that I want it
[47:53] to live.
[47:56] But the scripture says, "They that walk
[47:58] in the spirit,
[48:01] they that are led by the spirit of God.
[48:04] They are the sons of God.
[48:08] They're seated in heavenly places.
[48:12] They're not looking at what these five
[48:14] senses can see.
[48:17] But they're walking by what has happened
[48:19] on the inside.
[48:23] They're walking by a connection that now
[48:25] ties them to heaven.
[48:31] Amen.
[48:34] Amen. He said, "At that day,
[48:37] as we quoted this morning,
[48:40] you'll know that I'm in the Father
[48:44] that I'm in you and you're in me.
[48:48] That day is this day."
[48:52] So, this message came to show us
[48:56] that he is in us
[48:58] and we can say amen to that.
[49:02] But we are also in him.
[49:07] [Music]
[49:08] &gt;&gt; If we don't recognize it yet,
[49:11] then we need to say, "Lord,
[49:14] for us,
[49:16] Lord, let me recognize all that you did
[49:18] for me."
[49:21] That you didn't just pay the price for
[49:23] my salvation,
[49:27] but you paid the price for complete
[49:29] redemption.
[49:33] Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "When the bride
[49:36] recognizes who she is,
[49:40] then should be an invincible army,
[49:44] then the gates of hell cannot prevail
[49:46] against her.
[49:49] All the armies of the enemy won't be
[49:52] able to touch you.
[49:56] Not because you became something
[49:58] different.
[50:01] But because you recognize who you are,
[50:09] &gt;&gt; when you recognize that where he is, you
[50:13] are also
[50:21] in Hebrews 10, scripture says,
[50:25] says, "This is the covenant that I will
[50:28] make with them after those days. Verse
[50:31] 16,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; sayaeth the Lord, I will put my laws
[50:36] into their hearts, and in my minds will
[50:38] I write them.
[50:54] and their sins and iniquities will I
[50:59] remember no more.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Now where remission of these is, there
[51:09] is no more offering for sin.
[51:17] If we could recognize that
[51:21] we wouldn't fear the trials of life
[51:23] anymore.
[51:28] Because when we don't see that,
[51:32] then we think, well, I'm going through
[51:34] this cuz I deserve it.
[51:39] I'm going through this cuz I did
[51:40] something wrong.
[51:44] I'm going through this cuz I did
[51:45] something bad.
[51:48] No, his their sins and iniquities will I
[51:51] remember no more.
[51:53] [Music]
[51:56] And where remission of these is, there's
[51:58] no more offering for sin.
[52:06] Your trials don't pay for your sins.
[52:11] Your trials don't pay for your
[52:13] iniquities.
[52:16] They don't pay for your mistakes.
[52:20] Your trials mold you.
[52:23] The blood of Jesus Christ paid for every
[52:25] mistake,
[52:28] paid for every sin,
[52:31] paid for every iniquity.
[52:33] [Music]
[52:36] Says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[52:38] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[52:42] the blood of Jesus.
[52:50] Amen. By a new and living way which he
[52:54] has consecrated for us through the veil,
[52:57] that is to say, his flesh
[53:08] &gt;&gt; beyond the veil.
[53:11] So
[53:13] what was beyond the veil?
[53:17] &gt;&gt; The place of fellowship.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; God said to Moses,
[53:22] "By the veil,
[53:25] between the wings of the cherubim,
[53:29] there's where I will commune with you.
[53:34] There's where communion is.
[53:37] fellowship with God
[53:40] beyond the veil
[53:42] in that secret place
[53:46] in the place where God dwells.
[53:51] And and Paul says,
[53:54] we can have boldness to enter into that
[53:57] place.
[54:01] That was the place that you belonged.
[54:04] That was the place. That was your place.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; That was the place that that Adam and
[54:11] Eve were barred from entering.
[54:17] What was what was on the the veil of the
[54:20] holy place,
[54:23] the holy of holies
[54:26] was cherubim.
[54:30] Moses making it after the pattern he saw
[54:32] in heaven.
[54:37] And what was standing guarding the way
[54:39] into the Garden of Eden?
[54:44] Cherubam
[54:46] guarding the entrance.
[54:48] The entrance back into fellowship with
[54:51] God.
[54:53] The entrance back into the place where
[54:55] God dwells.
[54:58] the place where you belong.
[55:02] Jesus said, "I'm going to prepare that
[55:04] place.
[55:07] That where I am, there you may be also.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; I'm the way. I'm the truth. I'm the tree
[55:17] of life."
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] So those cherubims were guarding the way
[55:31] back to the tree of life.
[55:35] God said to Adam and Eve that came to
[55:37] combat it.
[55:40] When the red horse rider rode forth,
[55:44] there was an anointing there to combat
[55:46] it.
[55:48] When the black horse rider went forth,
[55:52] there was an anointing there to combat
[55:53] it.
[55:56] when the the pale horse rolled forth.
[56:00] There was an anointing there to combat
[56:02] it.
[56:05] Nothing could come past these beasts.
[56:10] These living creatures
[56:13] though they they could affect the earth.
[56:18] They could they could have an impact
[56:21] upon the world around them.
[56:25] whatever God allowed them to have
[56:29] yet. They couldn't touch the throne of
[56:31] God.
[56:34] They couldn't touch that place.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; It was protected
[56:43] &gt;&gt; behind the cherubim.
[56:54] But now
[56:58] there came a time
[57:00] when those seals begin to break
[57:06] in as we talked about this morning
[57:09] in the the breaking of those seals
[57:13] in in how that that each one of those
[57:17] seals begin to open
[57:22] God opening his book,
[57:26] not to the world,
[57:29] but to those that would receive the
[57:31] word.
[57:34] If you come in with your own ideas
[57:38] and you come in with your own
[57:39] interpretation,
[57:42] trying to bring the anointing of some
[57:44] system with you,
[57:49] trying to bring some anointing of the
[57:51] world with you.
[57:54] There's a there's a guard standing in
[57:57] the way
[58:00] saying you cannot come beyond this.
[58:04] You cannot see what is inside of here.
[58:09] The only way to come into there
[58:13] is through the way that has been made.
[58:18] And Christ is the way that has been
[58:20] made.
[58:22] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[58:27] So when he comes and reveals the seals
[58:32] because he's the only one that could
[58:33] open the book,
[58:36] he's the only one that could break those
[58:38] seals.
[58:40] And so when he comes down in the in the
[58:42] seventh angel's message,
[58:46] as he begins to sound,
[58:50] Christ now begins to reveal those
[58:52] mysteries through that message.
[58:57] Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[59:01] The only way to come in is to accept the
[59:04] word of God.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, I am the way.
[59:13] I am the truth.
[59:16] I am the life.
[59:18] It doesn't matter how much we might
[59:21] disagree.
[59:25] But the word when God reveals his word
[59:30] that is the truth.
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:34] We must accept it.
[59:37] If we refuse to accept God's revealing
[59:40] of those seals
[59:44] and want to stay with our own
[59:46] interpretation,
[59:49] then we are SEALING THE BOOK BACK UP TO
[59:52] OURSELVES.
[59:57] AND YOU cannot go in.
[1:00:01] But those that are born of the spirit.
[1:00:07] Jesus said, "Except a man be born
[1:00:09] again."
[1:00:12] Now when you come in this day,
[1:00:17] this revelation,
[1:00:20] the new birth is the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:22] Christ
[1:00:26] personally to you.
[1:00:29] So when he comes in your day,
[1:00:33] your day happens to be in the revealing
[1:00:36] of the word.
[1:00:40] Your day happens to be when the seals
[1:00:42] are open.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; So to accept the word in your day
[1:00:52] is to accept the message of this hour.
[1:00:58] There was messages for every hour.
[1:01:03] That was Christ revealing himself IN
[1:01:06] THAT AGE.
[1:01:09] BUT TODAY IS not yesterday.
[1:01:14] Today is today.
[1:01:17] And we need the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:19] Christ for today.
[1:01:24] And and because you you're now living in
[1:01:27] the opening of the word
[1:01:31] to receive Christ
[1:01:34] is to receive the opening of those
[1:01:36] seals.
[1:01:39] to receive this message
[1:01:42] will take you right into the mystery of
[1:01:45] God.
[1:01:49] Brother Brandham says, "Oh, come take
[1:01:51] the tree of life."
[1:01:55] Now, instead of the cherubims,
[1:01:59] he says, "I want to say something.
[1:02:03] Instead of those cherubims guarding this
[1:02:05] throne,
[1:02:08] They're out here seeking,
[1:02:12] trying to run people to the throne,
[1:02:17] trying to bring them through the gate,
[1:02:22] back to the tree of life again, that
[1:02:25] they might take this.
[1:02:29] So when you come under the breaking of
[1:02:31] those seals,
[1:02:34] you receive Christ in your day
[1:02:38] as he reveals himself to you.
[1:02:42] He says you must be baptized in my name
[1:02:47] because I am the way.
[1:02:50] There's no other name given under
[1:02:51] heaven.
[1:02:54] You can't be baptized in the titles,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; but you've got to be baptized in the
[1:03:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:04] because he's the only one that can bring
[1:03:06] you in.
[1:03:10] So when you accept now that truth
[1:03:14] and he quickens it to you by his spirit
[1:03:18] and you're born again by the spirit of
[1:03:20] God.
[1:03:23] Now as we heard this morning
[1:03:27] there that's not the end of it
[1:03:30] that there's NO LIMIT TO GOD'S POWER.
[1:03:34] There's no summit.
[1:03:37] But now you've accepted the word in your
[1:03:40] day
[1:03:42] and now he is taking you in.
[1:03:47] Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, those those cherubims."
[1:03:54] What about those great living creatures
[1:04:00] with their six wings
[1:04:03] crying out holy, holy,
[1:04:07] and the post of the temple were shaking
[1:04:09] at the sound of their voice.
[1:04:13] But but Christ now has brought you
[1:04:16] through there.
[1:04:19] He says they're actually standing on the
[1:04:22] outside now.
[1:04:25] You're on the inside.
[1:04:28] Those creatures that you afraid of,
[1:04:32] they're actually guarding you.
[1:04:36] Because
[1:04:38] you're not on the outside looking in,
[1:04:44] but you're ON THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT.
[1:04:49] At that day, you'll know
[1:04:51] that I'm in you and in me.
[1:04:55] [Applause]
[1:04:56] Oh, YOU CAN SEE GOD'S PROTECTION around
[1:04:59] you.
[1:05:02] The scripture says, "Who will lay
[1:05:04] anything to the charge of God's life?
[1:05:10] Who is he that condemnth?
[1:05:14] Who is he that's able to get beyond the
[1:05:16] protection of God's anointing?
[1:05:22] It's Christ that died.
[1:05:27] He's the one that now has brought them
[1:05:29] under his protection.
[1:05:33] Brought them into the throne room.
[1:05:36] They've been ushered in there.
[1:05:40] and you come and you see that that fifth
[1:05:42] seal,
[1:05:44] those souls under the altar,
[1:05:48] the Lord says, "That's not you.
[1:05:51] That's that's not your place.
[1:05:54] Come in a little further
[1:05:59] and you see that sixth seal before you
[1:06:04] that tribulation that is to come upon
[1:06:06] the world.
[1:06:08] Men's hearts failing for fear
[1:06:13] and your heart was once failing for
[1:06:15] fear.
[1:06:18] But now you've come into Christ.
[1:06:22] How you can, he says, you can't be
[1:06:25] touched by that.
[1:06:29] He says, how can I bring you through the
[1:06:31] judgment?
[1:06:34] You've already accepted the blood of the
[1:06:36] lamb.
[1:06:39] Your sins and iniquities I can remember
[1:06:41] no more.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; So he brings you in beyond that.
[1:06:52] into that seventh seal.
[1:06:55] Some people want to say the seventh seal
[1:06:57] isn't revealed.
[1:07:01] That's just because they haven't been
[1:07:02] inside.
[1:07:08] But if the seven seals not revealed,
[1:07:12] then the mystery of God can't be
[1:07:14] finished.
[1:07:16] But Christ is the mystery of God
[1:07:18] revealed.
[1:07:21] And now Christ is bringing his bride.
[1:07:26] And through that seventh seal,
[1:07:30] we come to this place.
[1:07:33] What is this place?
[1:07:36] It it's it's something
[1:07:39] something that can't be explained.
[1:07:44] You're now being ushered beyond the
[1:07:46] veil.
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:07:50] You're now coming into the Holy of
[1:07:52] Holies.
[1:07:55] You're coming into a place that shuts
[1:07:57] the world out.
[1:08:02] YOU COME INTO A PLACE where it's you and
[1:08:04] God alone.
[1:08:09] You become a mystic to the world.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; The world can't understand you.
[1:08:18] You can't explain it to the world,
[1:08:22] but you've COME INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH
[1:08:24] GOD.
[1:08:26] You're now walking with him and him
[1:08:28] alone.
[1:08:31] He is your satisfying place.
[1:08:36] He is your peace.
[1:08:39] He is your joy.
[1:08:41] He is your overcoming.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; He is your provision.
[1:08:48] He said, "I'm going to prepare a place
[1:08:50] for you."
[1:08:53] So that where I am there you can be also
[1:09:00] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:03] The third pole
[1:09:05] then the opening of the seals
[1:09:08] the capstone message of grace.
[1:09:12] The mystery of God
[1:09:14] a hidden room.
[1:09:17] You can't explain it.
[1:09:20] It's a revelation.
[1:09:22] It's you and God alone
[1:09:27] walking together
[1:09:30] in the Garden of Eden once again.
[1:09:35] Not not in this flesh,
[1:09:38] but in the soul.
[1:09:40] You've been sealed into Christ.
[1:09:44] Brother Brandham said, "You can no more
[1:09:46] die than God can die.
[1:09:52] God and man become one.
[1:09:58] He says this. Brother Brandham says this
[1:10:00] is God's great mystery of love expressed
[1:10:06] that God and man became one.
[1:10:10] The whole thing is God and man one.
[1:10:17] God and man was one there.
[1:10:21] And God and man is one here. So
[1:10:26] what is it? Being filled with his spirit
[1:10:32] him having the preeminences
[1:10:36] that was God's achievement.
[1:10:39] God's achievement.
[1:10:44] That's God's purpose to do that.
[1:10:49] that he might be in Christ
[1:10:53] and Christ in us
[1:10:56] in all of us together one.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; That was Paul's desire.
[1:11:06] Brother Brandham said, "I preach the
[1:11:08] same message that Paul preached."
[1:11:13] And the saints beyond the veil,
[1:11:17] they said, "We're resting on that.
[1:11:20] We're resting on that."
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:26] In Ephesians chapter 3,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Paul says,
[1:11:41] "For this cause I bow my knees," verse
[1:11:43] 14, "for this cause I bow my knees unto
[1:11:46] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:54] Ephesians 3 verse 14.
[1:12:09] It's your
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; It's a lot shorter in your language.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Let's go now to verse 17.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So, so this is now part of Paul's
[1:12:22] prayer.
[1:12:24] Says, "That Christ may dwell in your
[1:12:26] hearts by faith that you being rooted
[1:12:29] and grounded in love
[1:12:42] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:12:45] saints what is the breadth and the
[1:12:47] length and the depth and the height.
[1:13:04] and to know the love of Christ that
[1:13:06] passes knowledge that you might be
[1:13:09] filled with all the fullness of God.
[1:13:25] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; So what was Paul's desire?
[1:13:30] The same thing brother Brandham
[1:13:31] preached.
[1:13:34] That Christ would be in us.
[1:13:39] That let me just read it again.
[1:13:45] Christ in us and all of us together one.
[1:13:52] All that was in Christ, all that was in
[1:13:56] God, he poured into Christ.
[1:13:59] And all that was in Christ, he poured
[1:14:00] into the church
[1:14:04] that he might have the preeminences
[1:14:07] that he might bring her back to the
[1:14:09] Garden of Eden once again,
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:17] back into fellowship.
[1:14:20] Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; That you,
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; the bride,
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:14:31] God.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now you are on the inside looking out.
[1:14:41] You have entered into the throne room.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's where you belong.
[1:14:50] Paul said you can have boldness to enter
[1:14:53] into
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; God has enthroned himself in you.
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:07] Amen. Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 7
[1:15:11] says Solomon built him a house.
[1:15:14] I'll try to go slowly.
[1:15:18] But the Most High doesn't dwell in
[1:15:20] temples made with hands.
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] Heaven is your throne.
[1:15:30] God says, "Heaven is my throne
[1:15:33] and earth is my foottool.
[1:15:37] What house will you build for me?"
[1:15:41] What is the place of my rest?
[1:15:44] Amen. In
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2
[1:15:48] says, "You are therefore no more
[1:15:51] strangers and foreigners,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; but fellow citizens with the saints
[1:16:03] and of the household of God,
[1:16:08] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:16:11] apostles and prophets.
[1:16:16] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[1:16:19] cornerstone. Yes,
[1:16:23] in whom all the building
[1:16:29] fitly framed together
[1:16:32] groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,
[1:16:39] in whom also you are built together.
[1:16:45] for a habitation of God through the
[1:16:48] spirit.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; So God has enthroned himself within your
[1:16:57] heart.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The new birth
[1:17:04] now the spirit of God dwells within your
[1:17:06] soul.
[1:17:10] God dwells in you.
[1:17:14] God enthroned in your heart
[1:17:18] and we have been builded up into the
[1:17:20] habitation of the Lord.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12
[1:17:30] says, "You are come unto Mount Zion,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; unto the city of the living God,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; the heavenly Jerusalem.
[1:17:42] This is where you are come to."
[1:17:46] Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Not where you are going.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] Let's go to Revelations 21.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Here we see the new Jerusalem.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; But you are come to the heavenly
[1:18:09] Jerusalem.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You are there already.
[1:18:18] Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; So what do we see here in Revelations
[1:18:21] 21?
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:30] Let's start reading at verse n.
[1:18:34] And there came unto me one of the seven
[1:18:36] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:18:38] the seven last plagues, and talked with
[1:18:40] me, saying, Come hither, I will show
[1:18:42] thee the bride, the lamb's wife.
[1:19:03] Hallelujah. And he carried me away in
[1:19:05] the spirit.
[1:19:08] So where was the new Jerusalem?
[1:19:12] It was in heaven. Jerusalem.
[1:19:16] But now this is after the millennium.
[1:19:22] Now the the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:19:27] begins to descend out of heaven,
[1:19:32] descending into this dimension,
[1:19:37] descending down to where it can be seen.
[1:19:44] By the eyes of man,
[1:19:47] I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:19:52] And now the presence of God is coming
[1:19:55] down to dwell on the earth.
[1:20:00] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And and when he when he sees the new
[1:20:05] Jerusalem,
[1:20:07] the angel says, "Let me show you the
[1:20:10] bride.
[1:20:13] Where's the bride?
[1:20:16] She's seated in heavenly places with
[1:20:18] Christ Jesus.
[1:20:22] one day. This mortal body will be
[1:20:24] quickened
[1:20:27] and we will step into that place as a
[1:20:30] Christ.
[1:20:33] And one day then that place,
[1:20:36] that presence of God,
[1:20:39] that place where we dwell
[1:20:42] descends down onto the earth.
[1:20:48] Amen.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm making a way for you."
[1:21:00] He
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I go to prepare a place for
[1:21:02] you.
[1:21:05] And when I've prepared that place,
[1:21:09] I will come and receive you unto myself,
[1:21:13] that where I am, there you may be also.
[1:21:27] So we know that we've entered in beyond
[1:21:30] the veil.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; We know we've entered in to the throne
[1:21:36] of God.
[1:21:38] Brother Brandham says those cherubims
[1:21:40] are ushering us into the throne of God.
[1:21:48] You're built upon the foundation of the
[1:21:50] apostles.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You are this heavenly Jerusalem.
[1:21:58] Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; In in verse 22,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; oh I'm sorry. verse
[1:22:11] let's let's keep reading here in verse
[1:22:14] 11
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; having the glory of God and her light
[1:22:20] was like a stone most precious even like
[1:22:23] a jasper stone clear as crystal
[1:22:33] ginger
[1:22:41] and and had a wall great and high, and
[1:22:44] had 12 gates, and at the gates 12
[1:22:47] angels, and names written thereon, which
[1:22:50] were the names of the 12 tribes of the
[1:22:53] children of Israel.
[1:23:20] In verse 14, and the wall of the city
[1:23:23] had 12 foundations, and in them the
[1:23:27] names of the 12 apostles of the lamb.
[1:23:30] Amen.
[1:23:47] What is built upon the foundation of the
[1:23:50] twel apostles?
[1:23:55] You are being built upon the foundation
[1:23:57] of the twel apostles.
[1:24:02] Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is
[1:24:04] within you.
[1:24:09] God is building himself a habitation.
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And and when the new Jerusalem begins to
[1:24:18] descend down,
[1:24:22] now we don't see thunderings and
[1:24:24] lightnings.
[1:24:28] Now the light of God is shining through
[1:24:32] his bride.
[1:24:36] God has now completed his plan.
[1:24:42] And the light of God is shining through
[1:24:44] the bride of Christ.
[1:24:48] And that light is like a stone most
[1:24:51] precious.
[1:24:55] This is the way that God desired to
[1:24:58] reflect himself
[1:25:02] was through the the through his sons and
[1:25:05] daughters
[1:25:10] through the life of his bride.
[1:25:14] Jesus said, "You are the light of the
[1:25:16] world.
[1:25:21] Hill cannot be hid.
[1:25:26] You are meant to shine your light to the
[1:25:28] world.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Right now, the world sees this flesh.
[1:25:37] They see your mistakes.
[1:25:41] They see every every time you fall
[1:25:44] short,
[1:25:47] they say, "How could that be God?
[1:25:51] But you're not looking at those things.
[1:25:58] You're looking at Christ.
[1:26:02] You're looking beyond the veil.
[1:26:07] You're in fellowship with God.
[1:26:11] to you. It doesn't matter what the world
[1:26:13] thinks
[1:26:18] because you're in a world with you and
[1:26:20] God alone.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; And that world has not yet descended
[1:26:27] into the physical,
[1:26:31] but you are seated in heavenly places.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; This is what you've been sealed into by
[1:26:48] the spirit of God.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Now, what comes out of the heavenly
[1:26:59] Jerusalem,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; we can see that that is us.
[1:27:08] Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That that is us now.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That God has enthroned himself in us.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; So now what comes out of this throne?
[1:27:26] What? How? Why has God made us this way?
[1:27:31] What was God's design?
[1:27:36] What was his purpose in bringing sons
[1:27:38] and daughters to himself?
[1:27:43] That he might be become the complete
[1:27:46] expression of himself.
[1:27:52] Because you are the attributes of God.
[1:27:57] You are a part of him
[1:28:00] and he's molded your life in a certain
[1:28:03] way.
[1:28:05] because he wants to shine through your
[1:28:07] life in a certain way.
[1:28:13] Not someday a thousand years from now
[1:28:18] when we rule and reign with him.
[1:28:22] Though though we shall be his expression
[1:28:24] in that day,
[1:28:28] but today you are his expression.
[1:28:32] You are the word in flesh in your day.
[1:28:38] The bride is the new Jerusalem today.
[1:28:43] So now what should flow out from her?
[1:28:49] Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; What should flow out from her?
[1:28:57] We want we want thunderings.
[1:29:01] We want lightning.
[1:29:04] We want to strike this one.
[1:29:07] Strike that one.
[1:29:09] Do away with this stuff.
[1:29:12] Speak the power of God.
[1:29:16] But that's not God's design.
[1:29:20] God is the immutable God.
[1:29:24] He is unchangeable in his ways.
[1:29:29] So when the heavenly Jerusalem comes
[1:29:31] down,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; it's not a different idea,
[1:29:38] it's not a different purpose,
[1:29:41] but it's the same God
[1:29:44] expressing himself in his complete form.
[1:29:50] So if if he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:29:52] and forever,
[1:29:56] then the way that he will express
[1:29:58] himself in the new Jerusalem,
[1:30:03] in the new heavens,
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:07] the way the the bride will be expressed
[1:30:10] in that day
[1:30:13] must be the way the bride is expressed
[1:30:15] today.
[1:30:21] So what then is meant to come out from
[1:30:24] the heavenly Jerusalem?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; We are on the inside looking out.
[1:30:38] Now what is supposed to flow from the
[1:30:40] inside to the outside?
[1:30:46] In Revelations 22
[1:30:50] says, "And he showed me a pure river of
[1:30:55] water of life, clear as crystal,
[1:30:58] proceeding out of the throne of God and
[1:31:02] of the Lamb.
[1:31:20] So now that God is expressing himself
[1:31:22] through a bride,
[1:31:26] we don't see thunderings and lightnings
[1:31:30] in mysteries.
[1:31:32] We see a river of the water of life.
[1:31:37] Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; John chapter 7
[1:31:43] says, "In the last day,
[1:31:46] that great day of the feast,
[1:31:49] Jesus stood and cried,
[1:31:52] saying, if any man thirst,
[1:31:55] let him come unto me and drink. And he
[1:32:00] that believeth on me,
[1:32:03] as the scripture has said,
[1:32:06] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:32:09] living water.
[1:32:14] Amen. Says this, he spake of the spirit,
[1:32:18] which they that believe on him should
[1:32:20] receive,
[1:32:22] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given,
[1:32:26] because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[1:32:30] But but that was what he was. So So now
[1:32:34] he's saying by his spirit.
[1:32:38] When you drink of that spirit
[1:32:41] now out of you shall flow rivers of
[1:32:44] living water.
[1:32:48] The same expression of the bride in the
[1:32:51] new heavens and new earth
[1:32:55] is the same way God wants to express
[1:32:58] himself through you today.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; That's who you are called to be
[1:33:09] a vessel of God.
[1:33:13] a channel through which the rivers of
[1:33:16] life can flow.
[1:33:21] Amen.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; In verse 17
[1:33:25] says, "The spirit and the bride say
[1:33:28] come."
[1:33:34] And let him that heareth say, "Come."
[1:33:39] Let him that is a thirst come.
[1:33:43] Whosoever will, let him take the water
[1:33:46] of life freely.
[1:33:51] So now we see the spirit in the bride.
[1:33:55] They've become united.
[1:33:59] They're saying the same thing.
[1:34:02] They're saying, "Come and drink of these
[1:34:04] waters."
[1:34:08] Bible says, "Judge no man.
[1:34:12] that you be not judged.
[1:34:15] We're not called to walk around
[1:34:16] pronouncing judgment.
[1:34:21] We're called to cry, "Come,
[1:34:25] drink of the waters of life.
[1:34:28] Whosoever will, let him come."
[1:34:33] That's your calling.
[1:34:35] That the spirit of God might speak
[1:34:37] through you.
[1:34:40] that his spirit would live through you,
[1:34:43] that your life would become a reflection
[1:34:46] of him.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:52] Verse two,
[1:34:55] it says, "In the midst of the street of
[1:34:57] it, and on either side of the river,
[1:35:01] that was the tree of life, which bear 12
[1:35:04] manner of fruit and yielded her fruit
[1:35:07] every month. And the leaves of the tree
[1:35:09] were for the healing of the nations."
[1:35:15] Uh, Revelations 22:2
[1:35:46] Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You are the vessel of God's love.
[1:35:53] The fruit of the spirit is love
[1:35:58] and joy,
[1:36:00] peace,
[1:36:02] longsuffering,
[1:36:04] gentleness,
[1:36:07] meekness,
[1:36:09] goodness,
[1:36:12] faith.
[1:36:14] Against such there is no law.
[1:36:19] You're called to bear the fruit of
[1:36:21] Christ,
[1:36:24] to bear the fruit of the tree of life.
[1:36:28] He says, "I'm the vine. You're the
[1:36:30] branches."
[1:36:34] Where do we find the leaves?
[1:36:37] We find the leaves in the branches.
[1:36:42] the spirit pouring out through Christ
[1:36:47] through your life
[1:36:50] to bring healing to whosoever will
[1:36:56] whosoever will receive
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; in the message restoration of the bride
[1:37:06] tree
[1:37:09] he says what is fellowship ship.
[1:37:15] What do the leaves do?
[1:37:18] Makes it cool.
[1:37:26] Where the birds fly in under the leaves
[1:37:34] to cool off.
[1:37:36] There's your tree again.
[1:37:40] He shall be like a tree that's planted.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Who will be like a tree that's planted?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's Psalms chapter one.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody's somebody's having their good
[1:38:04] time.
[1:38:09] Well, we're having our good time
[1:38:18] says, "Blessed is the man that walketh
[1:38:22] not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
[1:38:24] standeth in the way of sinners, nor
[1:38:26] siteth in the seat of the scornful.
[1:38:40] But his delight is in the law of the
[1:38:42] Lord, and in his law doth he meditate
[1:38:45] day and night.
[1:38:55] He shall be like a tree planted by
[1:38:57] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:39:00] fruit in his season. His leaf also shall
[1:39:03] not wither and whatever he doeth shall
[1:39:06] prosper.
[1:39:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:25] whose whose delight is in the law of the
[1:39:28] Lord.
[1:39:32] Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; There's many that delight in laying down
[1:39:37] the law
[1:39:43] in in
[1:39:45] bringing persecution with the law.
[1:39:57] But whose delight is in the law of the
[1:40:00] Lord?
[1:40:04] Whose delight is in that word of God?
[1:40:10] Who wants to meditate day and night on
[1:40:12] his law?
[1:40:17] Only the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Because with the bride,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; she's come under a new covenant
[1:40:30] and his law has been written upon the
[1:40:32] tables of
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham says
[1:40:41] he'll be like a tree that's planted
[1:40:45] where people can come and sit down under
[1:40:47] the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[1:40:52] cool off a little bit.
[1:40:56] You're all flustered and
[1:40:59] don't know what's happened.
[1:41:02] Whether you die, whether you're saved,
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:08] whether you're saved or not,
[1:41:12] you don't know whether this church is
[1:41:14] right
[1:41:16] or that is right.
[1:41:18] Just come down under the tree that's got
[1:41:20] some leaves on it.
[1:41:25] Set the set down there.
[1:41:29] Let the winds of heaven go to blowing
[1:41:34] like a rushing mighty wind
[1:41:39] through the leaves, you know,
[1:41:43] and you begin to cool off a little bit.
[1:41:49] The fellowship in the spirit of Christ
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; flowing through your life
[1:41:57] brings healing.
[1:42:01] Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; How does that how does that come into
[1:42:04] practice?
[1:42:08] When we sit there in our living room
[1:42:12] and just begin to pray
[1:42:14] and just try to be so holy.
[1:42:19] Hush children, I'm praying.
[1:42:23] Hush wife, I'm praying.
[1:42:30] No, he says, "When you pray, go into
[1:42:32] your prayer closet.
[1:42:35] When you pray, go into your closet
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; that the God which sees in secret
[1:42:49] might reward you openly.
[1:42:55] So how then is is this practiced?
[1:43:02] How can we create this atmosphere of
[1:43:04] love?
[1:43:08] How can we let the spirit of God flow
[1:43:10] through us?
[1:43:14] Brother Brandham came into his home one
[1:43:16] time
[1:43:19] and his wife was all upset
[1:43:22] and his children were fighting
[1:43:26] and he came in and he put his wife's
[1:43:28] apron on.
[1:43:32] her ap her uh kitchen apron
[1:43:46] and he goes to the sink.
[1:44:01] and and he begins to wash the dishes.
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And and he begins to talk about that
[1:44:11] he's going to make supper for the
[1:44:13] family.
[1:44:16] His wife says, "Oh, you can't make
[1:44:18] supper."
[1:44:21] You know,
[1:44:24] like like our wives would say to us.
[1:44:28] At least I know my wife would say to me,
[1:44:32] she'd say, "You're not going to cook
[1:44:33] supper.
[1:44:36] Nobody's going to want to eat that."
[1:44:42] But but it began to change the
[1:44:45] atmosphere.
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:50] The love of God begin to come on the
[1:44:52] scene.
[1:44:55] Soon his wife was happy.
[1:45:00] Soon the children were playing nicely.
[1:45:06] Why? Because he had changed the
[1:45:08] atmosphere.
[1:45:12] Not by coming in and laying down the
[1:45:14] law,
[1:45:18] saying this is how you're supposed to
[1:45:20] act.
[1:45:22] You should have supper on THE TABLE BY
[1:45:24] NOW.
[1:45:27] KIDS. I'VE TOLD YOU not to fight.
[1:45:33] No, that wouldn't have expressed the
[1:45:34] love of God.
[1:45:37] But when he came in the humility
[1:45:41] and just began to to let the spirit of
[1:45:44] God move,
[1:45:47] not saying, "I'm going to bring the
[1:45:49] spirit of God on the scene."
[1:45:54] But no, he's just praying on the inside.
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:45:59] Lord, give me inspiration.
[1:46:02] Give me leadership.
[1:46:04] Now, if the Holy Spirit told us
[1:46:08] just go and wash the dishes.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Would we be humble enough to
[1:46:18] Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; What What about sisters?
[1:46:21] May maybe the children are all
[1:46:23] frustrated
[1:46:26] and we want to just set them down
[1:46:29] and give them a good licking.
[1:46:33] But maybe we haven't been in the right
[1:46:36] atmosphere,
[1:46:41] maybe instead of trying to push them off
[1:46:43] to the side,
[1:46:46] say, "Oh, go entertain yourselves.
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:54] go and find something to do.
[1:46:58] We need to sit down with them
[1:47:03] and maybe begin to play with them a
[1:47:05] little bit.
[1:47:08] Maybe begin to enter into their
[1:47:10] conversation.
[1:47:13] begin to come down to their level
[1:47:19] that the spirit of God can begin to move
[1:47:21] in our home,
[1:47:25] in our places of work.
[1:47:28] The spirit of God wants to move.
[1:47:32] Not Not everyone can receive it.
[1:47:37] That's right.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; But you have a promise.
[1:47:40] says, "Blessed are they which are
[1:47:42] persecuted for righteousness sake,
[1:47:48] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[1:47:55] You didn't come in there into work
[1:47:59] to try to set everything straight,
[1:48:05] but you've come in there to be a
[1:48:07] representation of Christ.
[1:48:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; You are the word walking amongst your
[1:48:15] workplace.
[1:48:19] Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you're anointed
[1:48:22] messiahs to this age.
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] In perfect faith,
[1:48:32] brother Brennham says, "Now faith is
[1:48:35] based on forgiveness.
[1:48:37] Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then as we said this
[1:48:44] morning,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; trying to get the church
[1:48:49] into a place to where we could really
[1:48:52] see apostolic times moving among us.
[1:48:59] That's what we all hunger
[1:49:04] and it's just laying right at the door.
[1:49:09] We see it, but we want to see more of
[1:49:11] it.
[1:49:15] We want it to be such a flow that it'll
[1:49:18] be a help to us.
[1:49:23] Us flow out to others.
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:30] Says remember Jesus never used his power
[1:49:33] for himself.
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:39] That's what it was. He He used it for
[1:49:42] others.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; That's what it was sent for.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Can you see who you are today?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; You are the salt of the earth.
[1:49:59] You are the light of the world.
[1:50:03] your living epistles read of all men.
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; You are his workmanship.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; You are what he has built.
[1:50:20] Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Created in Christ Jesus unto good works.
[1:50:27] That's right. that God hath before
[1:50:29] ordained that we should walk in them.
[1:50:37] Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Wherefore we receiving a
[1:50:43] kingdom
[1:50:46] that cannot be moved,
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; who can separate us from the love of
[1:50:53] God?
[1:50:56] You're on the inside looking out.
[1:51:00] You are protected by God.
[1:51:06] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[1:51:09] that cannot be moved,
[1:51:13] let us have grace
[1:51:17] whereby we may serve God acceptably
[1:51:24] with reverence
[1:51:27] and godly fear.
[1:51:30] For our God is a consuming fire.
[1:51:39] Let your light so shine before men
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] that they might see your good works
[1:51:48] and glorify your father.
[1:51:56] God has called you to be his voice
[1:52:01] to be the manifestation of his word in
[1:52:04] this day
[1:52:08] to be a conduit through which his love
[1:52:11] can flow.
[1:52:17] One one day that new Jerusalem will come
[1:52:20] down in the flesh
[1:52:25] and we shall reign and rule with him
[1:52:27] forever.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; But right now, you are the bride of
[1:52:34] Christ.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't wait. Don't wait and say
[1:52:43] over on the other side will be an
[1:52:45] expression of God.
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:53] But he wants to flow through you right
[1:52:55] now.
[1:52:59] In every trial you're going through,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; he wants to express himself.
[1:53:07] In every situation you come up against,
[1:53:12] he wants to express himself. Amen.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Let us give him room.
[1:53:19] Let us just be the candle
[1:53:23] that his light is shining from.
[1:53:28] Amen.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire?
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray together.
[1:53:37] Heavenly Father,
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just love you so much.
[1:53:43] And Lord, we we want to be all that you
[1:53:46] want us to be.
[1:53:50] Lord, we want to express you in the way
[1:53:52] that you want to be expressed.
[1:53:57] Lord,
[1:53:58] you have a design.
[1:54:01] You have a purpose.
[1:54:04] You have a thought.
[1:54:08] we were before the foundation of the
[1:54:10] world.
[1:54:13] And Lord, as we come into manifestation
[1:54:15] in our day,
[1:54:18] forgive us for trying to be who we
[1:54:20] wanted to be.
[1:54:24] Lord, we want to lay all those things
[1:54:25] down.
[1:54:28] We lay down our own ambitions.
[1:54:32] We lay down our own dreams.
[1:54:36] Say, "Father,
[1:54:38] not my will,
[1:54:41] but thine be done.
[1:54:44] Let us be found in your will, Lord."
[1:54:48] Lord, if we have come outside of your
[1:54:50] will.
[1:54:53] We pray that your spirit would bring us
[1:54:55] back under the blood today,
[1:55:00] Lord. that we can walk before you
[1:55:04] that we can express you,
[1:55:06] that we can express your love
[1:55:10] to those that are so in need of it.
[1:55:15] Lord, that they might know the grace of
[1:55:16] God
[1:55:18] that we have received.
[1:55:21] Grant it, Father, we pray to commit
[1:55:24] ourselves into your hands.
[1:55:27] In
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints.

[1:55:45] real blessing to be able to minister to
[1:55:47] you

[1:57:17] you've heard from him. You as you've
[1:57:20] heard him, you need also to speak back
[1:57:21] to him.
