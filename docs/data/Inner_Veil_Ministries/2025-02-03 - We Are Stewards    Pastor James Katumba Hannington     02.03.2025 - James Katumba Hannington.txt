name of Lord want to appreciate those who turned up fornight on Friday we had a good time and you know the nights these days are warm and we thank God for the grace he gave us praise the name of the Lord so today we have two Services we have this morning service then the afternoon service then from 5:00 we are going to start the Lord supper and then the foot washing praise the name of the Lord you know it's good to be part of all the Services of the lord we don't come here several times a week we come on Wednesdays 430 up to 7 then again we come on Sundays many times one service on Sunday once in a while two services on Sunday maybe some days the midle of Satur to come for praying and fasting then sometimes maybe overnight last Friday of the month so we need to see that we desire to participate in all the services of the Lord praise the name we need to show our faithfulness amen our pastor is not around today went to on Friday has been preaching the married people's meetings on Friday and Saturday then today is having a main service for every person then will be traveling back praise the name of our Lord just keep him in your prayers then on Saturday this week we have the wedding of our brother Isaac and we still call upon your support praise the name of our Lord that the Lord may be gracious so it's going to be on Saturday be the wedding will be here and then the reception will be outside there praise the name of our Lord so we are all called upon to be part of the function then Sunday we shall have only one service praise the name of our Lord there is a sister we came with sister if you can stand up she's there back there you welcome to be with us she prays from pastor church in and she's now in ginger doing some around welcome to be with us amen then we have our brother on if you can stand up bre wi you're welcome wi nowadays Works in a town and is there as the magr so we thank God put him there we pray God gives him more grace amen we have other people coming here for the first time if we can recognize you I believe we are not strangers praise the name of our Lord so this morning I sent and I was asking do we have a song before the minister you know because I was not seeing Faith but it's good I saw Joshua then I sent a message to find out Joshua do we have a song Praise the name of our Lord now our gift not our service not be dependent on one or two people I believe the youth who have been singing here every suay before the minister the same every Sunday one is way I believe should be a continuous commitment praise the name of our Lord and I believe it mat as well with today's suon we want to talk about we are stewards over every one of us we are stewards praise the name of the Lord so let us stand up and go to our scripture reading Luke 12 and then verse 42 Luke 12 vers 4 48 so the Bible says and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing the truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he has but and if this that servant said in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the men servants and the maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken the Lord of that servant will come in a day when he lookth not for him and at an hour when he is not aware will at him in a and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers and that servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did commit things worth of Stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for un soever much is given of wh shall be much required andto whom men have committed much of they will ask the more amen so we are sharing on that we are stewards every one of us is a steward praise the name of the Lord as a child at home you a steward as a parent at home you a Ste as a husband you a Ste as a wife you are a Ste and you know our stewardship keeps on varing you know based on the responsibility that you have like as a husband I have the stewardship of being a husband to my wife but that's not the end of it I have also a steward of being a father to my children and that's not the end of it I also have a stewardship of being a son to my parents praise the name of our Lord and then we also have stewardship beyond our families in the communities that we live in the work that we do in the activities that we are involved we are all stewards even if you are still staying with your parents you have a stewardship praise the name of the Lord and then now in the message God does not call man to judgment brother Bram says now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to [Music] God every man that come on the face of the Earth has to answer to God for a respons and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for this responsibility is stewardship so any responsibility that you have makes you a steward in that matter praise the name of our Lord then he says the stewardship that has been committed to Us by God I don't care what it is as I said a few moments ago AWI then be aing housewi that's right if it is to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that God has put you to do you got a stewardship to that you've got to answer to God for because it takes all these things to do it each of us is a steward every responsibility you have in life makes you to be a steward praise the name of the Lord at our homes we are Steward when we come to church here we are also steward praise the name of our Lord we have a responsibility something that the Lord expects from us that we need to do so each of us has got a responsibility each of us has got a role what God has committed you to do praise the name of it's our responsibility it's our stewardship now we go back to Luke 12 vers 42 it says and the Lord said who then is that faithful and [Music] wise so in being a steward you need to be faithful and you need to be wise praise the name of the Lord now to be a steward you are a manager you are entrusted with one Estate One property and buses or services that is still each of us we are stewards you are a manager you are an overseer you are entrusted with somebody's property you are interested with somebody's businesses you areed with somebody's Services we are all stewards and as stewards we need to be faithful in our stewardship and we also need to be wise in our stewardship praise the name of our now the Bible tells us in Psalms 134 praise the name of the Lord Psalms 134 and then verse three the Lord has made Heaven and Earth bless the out of Zion so he says the Lord has made heaven and he has made us so you look at the heavens and then you look at the Earth the Bible says the Lord has made them in Psalms 115 verse 15 yes it says Psalms 115 and verse 15 you are blessed of the Lord which made Heaven and Earth so it says the Lord has made the Heaven and Earth and then he has blessed us the heaven even the heavens the Lord but the Earth he has given to the children of men so it says God made the heavens and the Earth then says the heavens of the heavens they are thees and then when he made the US he gave to us so whatever we have doesn't belong to us we are stewards praise the name of the Lord then in Psalms 24 ver1 he says the Earth is the lordes and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein the ownership now and the fullness there even them thatwell on the Earth are the so you are not your own you are not your own you are the L so what are you you a you are a steward of your body praise the name over Lord you are a steward of your spirit you are a steward of your soul that's why there's judgment praise the name of our because God has created you and is the one who has given you the body that you praise the name of is the one who has given you the body you have but you know there are people are not comfortable with their bodies says the nose is too big I go for plastic they reduce it then it sees the shape of the head you know different ships we have some are like triangle then others are flat up here then others are straight here others are like a box others are like a ball you a steward of that praise the name of our Lord you are a Ste your soul you are a steward the Bible says all the fullness there and even them that dwell there so as a human being you are a steward of your body before God and there is a way God demands you to handle your body praise the name of you a steward God has made you and he gave you this body he wants you to have respect for your body praise the name of the Lord how you handle your body how you treat your body God demands responsibility praise the name of like you're not going to come out naked before people you are making a shame before the body God has given you and what God demands faithful stewards praise the name of Lord and then some others they are not comfortable with the color God has given them then they start and then you get there others where the formul doesn't work their pches here is yellow then others you get is brown but you look at the ears they black have they been painted black or then you look at the an down but up is white is brown we are stewards so there is what how good demands us to handle what he has given us the body God has given you you Steward that's why the Bible say you are the temple of God so you don't defile the temple of God you don't start doing things which are evil you know you don't start smoking you don't start drinking you don't start taking drugs that you know going with every man or every woman things like free [Music] love you know there are some people are like that every week is changing or every night is changing a mind that's not why God made us we are stewards praise the name of our there is a way God demands us how we need to handle so every one of us we are stewards of your body you are Steward of your spirit you Steward but you keep on watching you are feeding your human Spirit you are feeding your soul but you are a steward of your body you are a steward of your human spirit you are a steward of your soul praise the name of our and then in the Psalms 100 Psalms 100 and then verse the Bible says know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pass praise the name of Lord says it is God that has made us we are his people we are not our own praise the name of our Lord and when you realize that you are not of your own then you learn to be having confidence in God you learn to trust in the Lord you learn even to cry to the Lord when you are challenged in any condition the Lord will make a way for you when you realize I am not my own I am the Lord is praise the name of we are stewards we are stewards for our own Liv it's God who has given us this life so you are a steward for the life God has given us how do you handle your life how do you take care of your life praise the name of how do you handle you know after God giving us ourselves then he gives you a responsibility beyond your own body you know to live in a community maybe as a child at home you are a steward you have a responsibility before your parents praise the name of our Lord you have a role before your parents and a child at home will always desire to find out what do your parents want to and that should bring you Joy do what your parents are telling you you're not going to wake up and then you just remain in bed hey how are you going to eat will the food cook itself all the things you used at night them or the place you're sleeping in how will it become clean all the clothes you're putting on you know habits are habits some of the people who go in some of those single SE schools can take a month without bathing because nobody is there to talk about them and then others they can put on a shirt for the whole without comfort you know that kind of bad bad habits there you're not responsible you need to keep yourself clean and God demands us to be clean he was telling them wash yourselves before you come before my wash your clothes clean yourself keep your environment clean praise the name of the Lord you know like maybe you have a home and you don't have pit you want the author to just come and tell you that you need to have a pit that's not being responsible at home you are living in your home but it is BU and then in some places you find this same person he goes and digs in other people's places but that home it is and then when they go when you're going to their homes theth they homes theath say government has to work for us does the government use that road for you we are stewards and then some people where they go to draw the water the place is dirty they waiting for to come and work for them come to water from there if you fall sick is it the one falling sick you know people are becoming irresponsible over the things they meant to doise the name of over the things they meant to do who you want to come and remind you to keep your house clean there is sometimes where they would get don't want to bath and then they get them take them to either a wash them they pour on and then you find some of them when they are riding you you look at the shirt the colors changed but they just keep on in that kind of environment they are not stewards over what God has given to them now if you fa to take care of your body how are you going to take care of another person like maybe if is a sister or a woman she doesn't want to wash when she gets anything she gets a perfume not clean what will happen when you marry what will happen you've given birth to a kid you've been given birth to a kid you going to stop the child froming himself or you just we get more pumers this one and let me tell you those things are expensive they not cheap so you'll find you're using 10,000 but it's not only P that makes the child clean you breastfeeding the child but all your clothes are full of of breast milk all over breastfeeding that's your responsibility you need to keep yourself clean it's a stewardship and then you get a mother they don't care about their children the child are moving naked what kind of mother are you you know we have stewardship but if you can't take care of your body how you going take care of the children when they how you going take care of your husband how are you going to take care of your wife if you yourself so we are stewards praise the name of our Lord we are stewards and you know if you're going to marry don't stop at looking at them when they come to church also good to find out where they but then is coming they St manage the place those cobes you mean you have not been seeing them you're waiting for for you to see the C sometimes Cheng you see the there what are theth doing praise the name of Lord we are stewards we need to be responsible praise the name of Lord the things that God has given to us we need to be stewards and show that you are committed to the thing that you desire the thing how you going to take care of how you're going to keep it longer praise the name of our Lord so the Bible has said we are thees we are not our own praise the name of our Lord now when you realize you are the even what you have you are a steward you a steward over your life if you marry you are a Ste as a husband you are a Ste as a wife you Ste as a father you Steward as a mother but even other things you have you have a house you Steward over that house praise the name of our if start coming in your house you are responsible to fix those C praise the name of if the rains are coming and they washing away the foundation you are responsible to stop the water from coming to affect your house but then you find some people when when the rain start from the road and then they come sometimes even enter his house who do you want to fix that for you we are stewards over the things that we have if my shirt is tor should I go and show everybody that this place it is Stone you Steward go and fix it Go and fix it praise the name of the Lord there are things that we have that you can fix even that we are stewards praise the name of we are stewards over the things we have we are stewards over the things we do we are stewards praise the name of our and you know the Bible says Steward has to be wise and faithful praise the name of the Lord wise and faithful we shall get to it father as we move on now let us go to First coron 29 reading from verse 10 so it says wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever praise the name of our Lord David blessed the Lord Lord you are blessed forever and why was he blessing now in verse 11 it says thine oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord and th art exalted as head above above all see how he's acknowledging God lord if any greatness It's You Lord any any Glory any Victory it's you if is any Majesty it's you for all that is in heaven and in the Earth are yours even the kingdom is yours you are exalted above all things and now we need to learn that enough our Liv that even my own life is not mine the life I have the Lord is praise the name of the Lord has given me this life any time when the Lord so pleases he takes it away because it is in his hand we are stewards we are PS and strangers we just have season where we are here on Earth so even the things that we have they are not ours they all belong to you know in Kenya when the white settlers were there they made for 999 years nobody can last that long the man is is just putting there maybe somebody F because they were giving themselves and they say 999 years but you have no guarantee that in the 999 years policies will change the government will come and change whatever you think is yours like in some countries they were nationalizing compies you're not sure you just here for a period of time a short time but David is saying all that we have yours Lord and that's one thing need to recognize that when I've committed Sunday to the Lord Sunday is the Lord praise the name of when I wake up in the morning the things I'm doing in the morning they help me to be in the presence of God taking me from the Pres yeah he start finding out and you know God when he gives us he demands 10% just one out of 10 but even the one God demands out of the 10 you have no we are stewards so are we faithful stewards are we wise we say Lord you know i' I've labored a lot I went to school I was spending sleepless nights to read aot of this this this person to get this job you a steward because even before you could have the job God has given you the life you can have the job before you enter the office no more immediately they just remove you that's one thing I see with places of work you can be there a boss everybody worships you but notice time can just come when you have no more of that you have made a big plan but God says you fool I demand your soul and Jesus asks all that you've stored what would they help you we are stewards praise the name of our so David recognized that all anything he had every opportunity would get to it is the L and we should have also the same in mind whatever I have is the the life I have is the Lord the house I have is the L the I have is the L the family I have is the L I have is the L the business I have is the L the job I have is the L so when you realize that whatever you have is the you will fear and you will learn to be Faith what the Lord has given praise the name of our you will be faithful at your place you will be faithful in your family you will be faithful to your body you will be faithful the things that God demands from you praise the name of our now in verse 12 it says both riches and horor come of thee it says riches it's the Lord that gives you the opportunity to get them it's the Lord that gives you opportunity praise the name of in the overnight last Friday we had a sister who came and then when she for to give testimonies she came then she said um his great is it how Bishop so and so people like praise the name of but even whatever honor whatever opportunity you cannot be there praise the name of riches and honor all come of the Lord you re Over All and in thy hand is power and and in th hand is to make gra and to give strength unto all you see how all powerful the Lord says riches and hor might and power training says you are the one who decides it's the Lord the Bible says promotion does not come from east or west promotion comes from the Lord he raises this up and he throws this one it's the Lord we are stewards in whatever role you have you a steward praise the name of the Lord you a steward of your body you Ste over in your family you Steward in your community you are a Ste at your place of and we are also stewards in the kingdom of God praise the name of our Lord David say all this if we say we have anything it's you who has given to us and then the Lord needed to be given to build the temple and then now David is thanking God and then he telling him now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but whom am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly this s all things come of the and of your we have given you praise the name said whatever we have is yours lord said but you've given us opportunity that what we have we able to give you back praise the name of our Lord we need to have that kind of attitude he has given us the life so the life he has given us what do we do we give it back to God to accept the Lord Jesus as our personal to accept the Lord to be our Lord the mind that he has given you you have given it to him to meditate upon his word the soul that you have you have given it unto him to baptize with the Holy Spirit the body that you have you given it unto him to live righteously he says all that we have yours and of yours is what we have given you God praise the name of our let us go to that scripture praise the name of let us go to the Book of Malachi and then we can read there praise the name of our Lord let me get the scripture here me getse here Mar chapter 38 the Bible says will a man rob God now you can imagine your own life is the what you have the and you say that now let me Rob him said but yet you say you have robbed me but you say where in have we robbed thee and then he says offering robbed you know my salary is small so now you know the is can I pay over 100,000 I'm working for 100,000,000 God knows my my condition is bad and you know the Bible says if you faithful in the little you are faithful in the much now if God has given you 100,000 but paying 10,000 is too much for you but if you get a million 100,000 aot of money to give that is that's what say and you don't know that you are cutting off your blessings yourself because God owns everything so you don't know that you are affecting yourself you don't know that you are cutting off your blessing you don't know that you are causing your Investments to be divided you are cured with a cur for you have robbed me even this whole nation bringing all the ti into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now here with says the Lord of if I will not open you the windows of Heaven and power you out a blessing that there shall be no room enough to receive it the blessing of giving to God saying your ties pay your offering and the Lord says I will open the windows of until you have not enough room but now you have small money holding on very difficult you're robber that's what the Bible is saying offerings that one Rob like now when they are passing the basket to collect offerings look down busing something you bring your offering or you turn if you're not see praise the name of Lord when time to collect offering then you yourself and go to the toilet you know God knows our hearts he just knows say that that one it's not on me just dodging a byass they colle offering busy praying but they colleting offering he says you a robber and then he says in verse 11 and I will rebuke the div for your sakes and you shall not and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field says the Lord of H and All Nations shall call you blessed for shall be a delightsome land says the Lord praise the name of the Lord he says bring the ties and offerings praise the name of our Lord and here as a church we don't put our mind so much on the money but we have obligation as stewards to support the work of God we have

home prise the name you know I I've been going to a place in par I fa to go there on Friday I fa to go there on Thursday but last year because I got there once I go there for three days every month you have to get transport your fuel you have to get accommodation and these people had the culture when you going there for a meeting they want you to buy them food that's contrary to the scriptures the Bible says he that labors you the spiritual give him the natural then I went and preached thereon one day then I told them who of you can stay home and doesn't eat food but then why would you want me to come to bring you food when you are coming for the meeting you know it is the same thing you hosting a vis you V you come with your food how crazy is that praise the name of Lord but you see the devil puts us in that kind of condition and when we feel we are poor we can't do it and you poor because you are refusing the blessing but even what giving going to e but you don't want to give no

mind is to be in the presence praise the name of Lord you are trying to see that you commit most of your time to the Lord and then some people they like visiting on Sunday you are a steward over the time God has given you so how are you using that praise the name of our Lord you are a steward you have to be faithful in the and then you have to learn to appreciate God that he has given us to know that God demands respect God demands respect so when you come before the Lord you come with the heart prepared you come with thankfulness Lord I'm in your presence Lord bless me Lord speak to me Deliver me out of this this is the challenge I'm having and then you will have respect over your but now if you don't respect he says if you don't hon me how will I Hon you praise the name of our Lord let us go to Mal chapter chapter one and then verse six he says a son honth his father and a servant his master if then I be a father and where is my honor and if I be a master where is my fear says the Lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and ye wherein have you despised thy name [Music] you offer polluted bread upon my Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee and in that you say the table of the Lord is contemp and if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you offer the lame and sick is not is it not evil offer it now unto your Governor while he be

you give man now let us go 6 16 verse 17 16 ver he says every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he has given thee 16y know we are blessed differently some God has given them more some less but even in the little God has given he wants you to give praise the name of our Lord based on what he has given to us you may be working in the same place I'm an office but God demands me from the little I get I give I may the B place of and God maybe is giving me maybe two or three millions if they give me 3 million 300,000 and you may find that my ti of 300,000 the other one an office messenger is getting only 200,000 so even theeng to pay 20,000 and I should do it out of a willing heart grudging saying you see when they told us on the of the en we

with the simpli there is the Bible says they that give should do it with Simplicity not wanting everybody to know you know that toilet I'm the one who worked on it no praise the name with simplicity let us go to Romans chapter 12 praise the name of our Lord Romans 12 praise the name of our Lord and then we read in verse let us start from verse 6 okay let us start from verse 8 he that EX on EX he that give let him do it with Simplicity he that lth with diligence he that show Mery with cheerfulness praise the name of the Lord now in the message God can't call a man to judgment without first warning him brother says we are responsible we are responsible and God has put us here on us for a reason and that reason that he has put us here for we are responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do praise the name of the Lord says go to God ask God what should I do then he says if you went to work for a man and he give you a job on a ranch or something another and then you went out to the B and then just set down there and say where see you must ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you are working for a man find out what your duty is praise the name of Lord and then if our life is on Earth then we should go to the the one who put us here and say Lord what would you have me to do what must I do why am I here if it is to be a housewi a dishwasher if it is to be whatever God wants you to do do that the very best that way you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little it is you must do it praise the name of the Lord like if I'm a teacher praise the name of the Lord I've been given a job as a school I have a responsibility to teach I have responsibility to guide the children the work have been given now if I'm a teacher and then I come to school at 10 the children have reached at 7 I'm not doing my stewardship or if I'm a teacher I know there there are lesson plans which have been made there are topics are meant to teach over a period of time and now when I go to class I start talking about stories what did you eat at night about dress the whole lesson I'm just talking about those things I'm not being a steward praise the name of Lord if I'm a teacher maybe primary but I don't go to get these things of P to teach the children and then I start teaching them things of somebody in P teaching them one one you eating your job you are failing your job you failing your stewardship you not doing your best so as stewards we have been committed to you know to do what we are required to do and you know in stewardship there is giving accountability there is giving accountability of what you've been given to do there is accountability praise the name of as a hband you have to accountability somebody will demand of course they will not come and ask you but then they can start seeing after one year but these brothers they were withed recently why are they not living together accountability why wouldn't you be with one another who force you to be together and then why are you separating stewardship has failed there as a parent there accountability you've raised your children but on the village your children are the most rebellious people why yours and why not the others you giving accountability now whether you a good Steward as a parent or you are a bad Steward we have stewardship in everything we do they have given you a business they have given you a cap of 1 million but now for you when the customers are coming to the shop you are still sleeping at the end of the month the things that perish will expire then you throw them away when they come to to audit your business there is less money and then some people when they are running a shop and then he's in that shop says I've taken long without taking Coke he picks from the capital and then he takes Coke you eating your shop not be there so some of us eat our stewardship you div it God has given you a responsibility but youing it you've been given work to do you don't want finish assments now who'll keep you with that job they have told you on Monday we need this then you give excuses you are losing your job you are losing it we are stewards so wherever we have been put do the assignments that are required of you the responsibilities that are given to you do them praise the name of our Lord God has given you work be faithful doing that work God has given you a family faithful raising that praise the name of our Lord there where the Bible they that disturb their their houses at end of get wind yes I want to get that scripture I hope I can get it in Proverbs Proverbs 11:29 praise the name of our Lord Proverbs 11 29 the Bible says he that travels his own house shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be Ser to the wise of heart God has given you a house you know you have a family you have a husband you have a wife you have children you have parents and then you travel your house the accountability WIS when others like now some families when they have raised their children well you see the daughters bring men who are going to marry them at home there is a function for you your children are conceiving from home he goes with this man conceives then again you hear he has conceived wind because you didn't do stewardship as a parent you didn't raise your children well you didn't take time with your children show them the way of the Lord fear of the Lord so inheriting you are inheriting shame your children instead of taking them to school like we have where people their children to but which skill is there in cutting sugar you're traveling your house so we need to see that we are faithful Steward in the things the Lord why your neighbor's children coming celebrations of graduation your they watch from AAR we shouldn't do like that praise the name of the Lord we are stewards at home we are STS at our places we are in the Kingdom we are Ste there what God expects us to do praise the name of so as a steward you need to be faithful you need to be wise you need to do things with diligence see that you put effort in what you are doing has given you a job give respect for the if they want you to be there early enough be there early enough and when you are there working pretend you know I live Jack that's not that's not correct praise the name of our Lord you don't do things like that you don't do things to please the people my boss is around so you work hard when he's not around you on other things like there are some places you go to you know they are meant to attend to you but on Facebook TI Tok even when you talk to them their mind is not there what are you saying we have not looking at here either on a phone or telion all the mind is on that is not at place of it's just the body which is there but there's no service and at the end of the the performance is bad when they come TOA the performance is less than 50% and then they look at transferring you or removing you from there [Music] retrenchment I remember I think it was in the early when they had the commission of inquir I think it was under Revenue something it was under Revenue Authority I don't know how it was called that time and now they wanted to restructure the organization to reduce the people and pay them more so they would call one by one and they ask them hey when you come to work what do you do you know when I come to work have a conversation I do this they reported themselves now they assess what you say youve been doing and what you're doing is worth only let us not eat our jobs praise the name of Lord because there is losing stewardship yeah there is losing stewardship you been given stewardship you are not committed to it somebody takes over the place and don't start complaining you don't want me at a place work now remov from you have eaten your job you've eaten it you've despised it so we need to see that we are faithful and always committed at our places of work praise the name of our we need to be faithful stewards and whatever God has committed to us we are responsible to do the job as required of us you Steward over your life before God you are a steward for you are as a father as a mother you are a steward as a husband you are a Ste as a wife you are a steward as a parent you are a steward as a child you are a steward for your [Music] property you are a Ste you are a steward at your place of you are a steward for your talent you are a steward this is my talent nobody should talk about me for that gift God has given to you so you don't brag about it faith in what the Lord has given you are a steward for your calling we are stewards for the kingdom of God any responsibility makes us Steward and then we are stewards over the time God has given to us the life we live on earth we are stewards praise the name of the Lord you are Steward over your time praise the name of Lord if you waste your youth you you regret in future praise the name of the Lord you are taken to school but you're busy in groups group you want to be the famous group at school you are failing your Steward praise the name of Lord you faing yourself you've been given an opportunity to do work but you desp even the work you don't want to Lear and you know when you Steward there is also to improve your stewardship to do better than you've been doing now the way you started it was good then you're doing bad that means you are saying I no longer want this job so you lose it it goes away from your hand we the people used to work there then what happen you at your job oh my family was Al good my children has happened now God gave you that Steward you needed to be diligent praise the name of our Lord you know as a husband you are a steward to love your wife praise the name of the Lord regardless you a steward your wife as a wife you are a Ste your husband submissive to him it is stewardship praise the name of Lord so you find that our stewardship is about everything that we do in life and God desires us to be faithful stewards and when you are a faithful Steward you also need to be a wise steward was given stewardship as a king us go to first samel 15 and then verse one praise the name of our lordu 15 the Bible says Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore how can thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord thus says the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalec did to Israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite AMC and UT destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and sucing ox and sheep camel now SA God has made him a steward as a king so he had a responsibility and it's God who called him anointed him him this and now your master is telling you go and kill the Amit don't spare anything now Saul in going out he sorted something things out he left the king and then the good things they said these are ours then the bad things they destroy he was not a faithful Steward so he didn't follow the word of God he was not a faithful Steward so when he was not a faithful Steward he lost his stewardship praise the name of our now let us continue further here verse 15 and Saul said they have brought them from amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed but have told him destroy everything no I've sorted some things out stewardship faithfulness is to do what you are required to do and you know as stewards we need to be faithful in all the responsibilities that God has given unto us you need to be a faithful husband as a steward you need to be a faithful father as a steward praise the name of our Lord God has given you children you are responsible to raise your children not to raise them from the neighbor praise the name of our you know sometimes in villages When the Children know that at home there's no food then they go the neighbor try to play around children are not raised from the neighborhood as a father make your home conducive praise your children praise the name of the Lord a steward otherwise if you fail that you lose the of Father even your children not respect you they respect another person you think our father cares You've Lost Your stewardship there's no horn of being a father in so we need to see that we handle our Steward Faithfully some some mothers are working but they live the responsibility of mother to they leave it to the m did you give birth you know being a mother is not conceiving and producing there is nothing praise the name of there is nothing and you have to see that every day you take interest in the Affairs of your children when the children are sleeping when they are dirty whom do you blame you blame the housemate but you the mother we are responsible so we need to be faithful stewards be concerned about what God has given if you are a mother be concerned as a mother the Affairs of your children if you are a wife concerned as a wife about the Affairs that concern your husband the same thing as a husband to your wife praise the name of you be concerned are you dressing her no she has to dress herself no that's not scripture Christ dresses his wife and the Bible says you have to provide as a wife you have to be submissive you are supportive you know you are meant to give be a companion but you're not doing those kind so you're not faithful in your stewardship as a worker you are meant to be dedicated at your place of but you don't care what you do now when theary delays you start complaining you to be paid that money praise the name of our Lord know there are some who remember the last day of the month now my but then you ask them what have you done this month he can't give account for his time praise the name of now there was also another one we see s lost his stewardship now let us go to verse 23 for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubborness is as iniquity and adultery because you have rejected the word of the Lord he also has rejected Ed you from being King so he lost his stewardship because he was not faithful we can look at another example here about being a wise Steward like now God has made us stewards you need wisdom in your stewardship you need to see that you improve your performance you improve your skills praise the name of the Lord you know as stewards praise the name of Lord let us go to First Kings 12 and then verse one the Bible says and rehoboam went to she for all Israel were come to shim to make him King and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nabat who was yet in Egypt had of it for he was fled from the presence of King Solomon and jerob jeroboam dwelt in Egypt that they sent and called unto him and jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke unto rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke Grievous now therefore make th the Grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put Upon Us lighter and we will serve thee [Music] that's what they required we have Heaven Lords as king asking the king our light We Shall Serve You So what he went to the wise men who were wise who were giving counsel to his father now you can imagine Solomon as the wisest man on Earth he hadel how interesting it is wisest people are giving him C so now when reob went to the wise men who were in the days of his father he asked them in verse six and the King rehoboam consulted the old man that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do you advise that I may answer these people and then the wise men they told him if you will be a servant unto these people this day and will serve them and answer them then speak good words to them they will be servants for you forever that's what the wise men were telling that what you do accept what they saying now hadow young men who had grown up with him who were playing with him and then he went those very young men and then he asked them and said what should I do so the Bible says in verse but he for the coun of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him and he said unto them what can give you that I may answer these people who have spoken to me saying make the Yoke which father put on us later and the young men that grown up with him spoke unto him saying th shall you make these people that speak unto you saying thy father made your yoke heavy but make it light to us shall you sayto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's Lo see the wise men have told him allow accept it the youth he grew up with now when we come to the ministry as somebody who is running in the ministry or you have started you also go to other people have started them that's what was doing he despised the wisdom of those who advised his father and he went with the wisdom of the fellow young now like you find a sister she has just got married and she's asking not married sisters who are not married people are failing in their people that's not being wise you've just started a business you're also going to somebody who has just started advice can you can give you you go to somebody who has been in that thing and will tell you the story you do you do as a young man you've married a wife then you go fellow youth married my wife she was telling me this and this no no don't do that the man has never been there lost the kingdom he lost the stewardship when those people came back to him and he told him he told him my small finger shall be thicker than Lo of my father you know what they say what do we have in David the 10 tribes left the kingdom he lost his stewardship so now in whatever stewardship we have we need to be faithful and wise praise the name of Lord see that you seek right C from people who are trusted not everybody can give you good not everybody but why is it that for you your friends those are the people who are breaking people's hes your friends those are the people doing deals all the time they will cause you to do the same thing the same thing at your home why is it to you the people are your friends the people talk against the ministry the people don't like want to be part of the service those people you like having fellowship with they are putting fun Spirits in so now you are affecting your stewardship that was he rejected the of the old men and he lost most of the Kingdom he lost most of them so God has called us as stewards we need to be faithful do what is right we need to be wise praise the name of our Lord you need to be dedicated like now if I'm a preacher praise the name of I need to find out how best can I be a better preacher I don't just wake up and just come on the par and then start studying from here all the time I'm on searching of my phone shouldn't be like that praise the name of our as a song leader I don't come here and then things get over you know in some of these denominational preachers he comes with one scripture then rotates on that when they are over then he says let us say Amen Let Us stand us know wind of demons comes from Lake vict let us raise our hands he's looking for another thing to tell the because it has run dry then again say let us hallelujah us who is having a song come on sing for us looking for another praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says read in the book of Peter first p 4 says as every man has received the gift even some Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manold grace of God if a man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God a man Minister let do it as the ability which God that in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to will be the praise and the Dominion forever and ever praise the name of our we are stewards do things as the ability praise the name of not a pret behind there is nothing until even what you preach has no impact upon the life but now if it has the anointing of God bring the transformation of the people praise the name of the Lord and then in 1 Corinthians 4: 1 the Bible says let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found praise the name of as a steward you need to be found faithful and as a minister we are stewards of the mysteries of God and as children of God we are stewards of eternal life praise the name of our when you have eternal life you can Minister eternal life to another we are stewards I have to cut many things short praise the name of our Lord now let us go to this scripture here just say that we conclude let us go to 2 Kings 22:7 the Bible says how bet there was no Reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt Faithfully praise the name of the Lord you know there was a need to do a renovation repairing the temple but you know in any work no you can't do everything as a person so different people have got different assignments thing in the services of the Lord each of us has got a a point to play the name each of us has got a role to if I've been called Services of the Lord if I'm a minister the Bible says let me minister with the ability that God I'm a translator our brother here let me do it to the best of my knowledge to improve what I'm doing I need to take time let me read like if I'm translating what does the scripture mean here if I read in English what is it inanda is it in praise the name of like As an interpreter you know I have Thea Bible I have the luganda Bible the English Bible and I get time and I read a certain scripture then I say how do they put it here what they you are taking time to improve your skill that is wisdom praise the name of I'm learning I'm improving I'm a song leader okay this is how I do the song leading but how the others do the song leading I take time others listen to others praise the name of Lord these footballers here before they go for a tournament they have to go and watch their opponents how they play they if I'm going to score this is a weak point this keeper knows how to dive left so if I'm going to go a problem this keeper knows how to jump so if I'm going toore put it down they go and study praise the name of Lord so even me I go like I've preached a certain subject maybe it has not been a little bit clear how does this one handle that even I call there is this and this there something I'm not understanding oh I've read the thing in the scripture how does brother talk about this this kind of word what does it mean I'm trying to enrich praise the name of I'm a worker go for further training say my degree is enough maybe what you learned is no longer applicable so there is continuous training continuous professional development so you keep on learning that makes you relevant at your place of work how about your preaching if every we come and preach the same thing when are we moving over from here praise the name of I'm a musician let me learn new skills this one okay this is better why is this voice not coming out time praise the name of the Lord now the scripture we have read it says that these people were given money they didn't ask them for accountability why because they were faithful in other words the work that they did just give the account now you ask that where why do you ask where the m has G you see all the things so even what he has done is more than what we gave him that's how we need to be at our Steward as a steward as a father do more than a father mother do more than a mother as a husband no more than a husband as a wife more than a wife whatever God do put you into do excellen that when somebody comes what you have done talks for itself praise the name of for not you know like in construction they give you materials when boss is away some you put on money and other buses you mix the ratio mixing is poor by the time you go to hand over the building the cracks have started coming is it but the Bible says they didn't require these people to give accountability because what they did was right what they did was faithful praise the name as Christians what is our conduct that's our accountability I'm born again let them look at your conduct does it account what you believe because they has to be a physical discipline what you do you have been in a business one year at the beginning you started the sh are full at end of they they will not ask you they the next time even rent will be difficult to pay but when they see you you started you started with just a few things on the store at the end of the year the shop is full next year thinking of increasing the space then you are diligent in your praise the name of our this is what the Lord wants us to be if I'm a Christian let me be a better Christian and that's what you should strive to be a better Christian all the time praise the name of our Lord now in the message awaken Awakening Jesus now God chose to use man now he could have chose to use the son to preach the gospel he could have chose to use the wind to preach the gospel he could have chose the Stars he could choose anything he wanted but he chose man praise the name of our Lord and somebody is going to do it that is right somebody if he could just ever find a man one man that he could get in his hand he will do it he's had such a hard time to finding one man I think of Samson he found a man with plenty of strength and Samson dedicated his strength to God but he wouldn't give his heart he gave his heart to God wants your heart your strength your soul your body your mind all you got it's the only way he can use you use the whole man praise the name of our Lord and as stewards let us give everything we have to the services of the Lord praise the name of the be a faithful Steward praise the name of the Lord be a diligent Steward praise the name of the Lord let us go in this message demonology brother Bram says I take it myself and before God as my judge I put it in the gospel work Yonder so I know that one day that when I will have to give an account for my stewardship it's given correctly that is exactly right because I realize as I treat the people I'm treating God just my attitude towards you is my attitude towards Christ and your attitude towards me is the same thing so brother Bram says you will have to give accountability we also have to give accountability for all our stewardship the responsibility God has given for your life for your family for your place of work and for the work of the kingdom of we have to give accountability then in the message says and now it will be used for overseas mission was receiving money and whatever money he would receive would pick a little for himself and the rest of what he would receive would put it into the missions to send it over to the different missionaries in different places and then he says I give it for the missionary fields and preach to the people that hasn't got one penny over there missionaries preaching the gospel no shoes on no sh preaching the gospel and now you would expect people like that to sponsor a meeting they couldn't do it how could they send for me to come over there and go back remember your money that you put in will go for that purpose to help save those that Jesus died for and I know that when it is put in my heart I am a steward of that and then from then and God will make me answer for it at the day of judgment make me to answer so I want to be a good Steward everything that I can how about us the money you earn will give accountability how are you going to give accountability praise the name of where are you putting it are you putting it in the things that perish or you're putting in the things to get souls into the kingdom and as children of God somebody did something somebody did something to help us be what we are how about you how much are you concerned about others praise the name of Lord we receive free message books but some people are contributing how about what you have what are you doing what are you doing for the kingdom of God you have to build a sted building in G and then when I build a sted building in ging the highest go there I have to get one in get one in all those things what are investing in the kingdom of God because in the Kingdom of godal you're getting Souls into the
