Ohio so he's going to be here for this morning service gave him to us because he has been in the country uh but uh when I suggested to the host where he has been if he could come and give us a service we were given the opportunity for him to be here we are very blessed people to have brother Rony with us and uh we welcome you to the platform and have all the Liberty to speak to the purchase of the blood of Jesus [Applause] Christ bless amen how many was glad when they said coming to the house of the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord I'm just brother Ronnie I'm just your brother and we love you and we we we believe that we're making a Rapture together amen we're humbled to be in the Pulpit this morning brother Sten tremendous blessing in uh his ministry in our life amen amen have much respect for you brother Sten hon to greet your congregation if we could stand this morning amen we bring greetings from the church back home Pastor brother Wayne and brother raay send their greetings so they don't know us but we're praying for them amen amen second Corinthians one thing we know is that no matter where you're from you're in a battle prophet of God told us that we're not called to a picnic a picnic celebration but we're called to a battle in this life is always going to be a battle and there's going to be victories and there's going to be defeats but we know who wins the final battle amen amen 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter and the second verse but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of stronghold casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of [Music] Christ amen amen so the weapons that we are fighting with are not carnal weapons but we are fighting a spiritual battle this morning and I believe it's important to know what our weapon is so this morning just for a title I'd like to speak on word Warfare amen if we can just bow our heads this morning Father we thank you Lord for your grace Lord Jesus we we just we love you this morning Father Lord we ask that you just Lord anoint this word this morning Father Lord that you'd open it to us fresh father Lord that you might be the quickening life behind it father Lord that it might it might encourage us along the way Lord father we we give you all the glory and honor Lord father as you commune with us now we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated thank you brother I already broke my voice since I've been in Uganda so pray for him amen but Paul is telling us here that our our battle is is not a flesh battle [Music] but the real battle we're fighting is in a spirit realm and we see a as the world in its condition today that Israel is is a natural type of of us in the spiritual is that right and we see Israel is fighting a great battle today and and and they have they have been trained to fight Israel has has been trained to fight since they were a nation they they were born a nation into battle the very uh uh nation of of Hebrews uh came from Abraham when he was coming back from the Battle of the Kings and he crossed over the river so the word Hebrews means one who crosses over so they have been a nation that has been fighting since they were were were created and and and we believe that that's the natural type of the spiritual church for as long as God has had a seed here that seed has always been in a battle but we see that that now in this age that we're in the enemy attacked Israel in their own country on their territory and when the enemy came to Israel's territory it gave the authority to Israel to attack back and now in this age in the spiritual world the devil has come to attack us in our territory not a territory of flesh but on the [Applause] word that is the territory of the seat of God and the and and and the the the devil doesn't realize what he has done is he has awoken a sleeping giant he has awoken a warrior within you that knows how to fight a battle on the word now this is not a battle of fist or of guns but the devil has challenged the authority of the word in this hour and our confidence is in the word will defeat him any time any place anywhere under any condition the word will defeat the Devil so he's picked a fight with us on our territory in the word is that right now I I believe Paul is telling us here that that that our weapons of this Warfare are Mighty through God pulling down the strongholds casting down imagination and everything that exalteth itself above the word anything that exalts itself above the word is defeated by the word hallelujah hallelujah so I'd like to ask this morning how many of us are in a battle this morning how many of us are in a fight this morning but I would like to call to Arms today who's ready who's ready to go back to battle again I believe the enemy has attacked us and attacked us and have gotten us to retreat retreat but I would ask today who's ready to fight back against the who's ready to take the sword of the word The Sword and go forward into battle I believe we have all that we need in this word to defeat every Affliction in this age I believe it's time we use the the word against the devil so I would like to challenge the devil this morning I would like to challenge him to a war on the word not a war of words but a war on the word amen amen the Bible tells us in the book of James to resist the devil and he will the prophet said he'll not just just walk away but he will flee from you now this word resist it means to withstand the force or effect of an attack so it's telling us you will be attacked and you will be tempted but resist the devil and you will overcome the Temptation resist the devil by the power of the word and he will flee from you you see the devil is not scared of me he's not scared of brother Sten or my brother here but he is scared of the word that is inside of us he has been defeated too many times and he recognizes the word inside of you will defeat him anywhere it's time we take the battle to the world Amen brother Brandon would say this is it okay if I just read a little bit he said say that Old Devil now you think he's bold Brazen you think he'll attack a child he'll attack anything he attack Jesus Christ he come at him with three wild attacks did you know that Satan didn't just only attack once he will attack you with a disease and then he'll come back and attack you and tell you the days of Miracles is passed you see the prophet is telling us how the devil does Warfare he will attack your faith and then he will come back and attack the authority of the word the days of Miracles is not pass but Mark 16 is still in full effect and they shall lay their hands on the S and they shall recover you see I don't believe the scripture has expiration I believe if he said it once it still works today amen he says he attacked Jesus three times three wild [Music] attacks he run in on Jesus with his unbelief in God's word but you see Jesus was the word sure he was the word but he said here he come and attack him like the enemy today here they come and said if thou be the Son of God show me a miracle let me see it done he said three attacks and he flew in now what did Jesus do but Jesus was the word of God he was the word he attacked the word with the word you see the devil made a mistake he attacked the word with the word Jesus is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he was the embodiment of the word the word made flesh and dwelt among them and what dides Jesus do then he cut him to pieces said he cut the devil to [Music] Pieces what did he use to cut the devil to Pieces the word he used the word Satan came in and attacked the word but the word that he was speaking to was Stronger cut him down with the word hallelujah hallelujah you see his attack Prophet says listen close his attack is what to disbelieve God's word that's his attack and there you could see the greatest battle ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you he disarms you then if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon brother bam said it's equivalent or the same when he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough so Satan's weapon against us is to attack our belever belief that our weapon is strong enough oh he's disarmed you then he's disarmed you then amen but you see the devil doesn't know that he's attacking the same word again in the life of the believer the same word that defeated him there is the same word that will defeat him today amen amen so brother bam says don't ever lay down your weapon don't ever lay down belief in your weapon because he says that finishes it he said he's got you then but he said hold that weapon don't ever lay it down amen if the scripture says it I believe it if the prophet said it I believe it if the Bible said that the word is made flesh and dwelt among you I believe it no matter what it looks like no matter what I feel like the Bible told me that the word was made flesh in the same word that was in Jesus is the same word in you so the same word has the same Authority in the same power in the same manifestation doing the same Works in you the bride B where is the body of Christ today it's you where is the word today it's you where is the weapon of God today it's you you are the weapon that God has chosen defeat the enemy today amen amen am can you understand okay amen can you understand in the back amen praise the Lord God has built you he has thought of you in his mind for this age you see God had a thought for every age God once had a thought of a man that would be so religious he would be trained in the schools he would he would speak all the languages he would know the Scrolls he would be so religious but then that man would be on his road to Damascus and he would be struck by the light of God and he would humble himself to the backside of the desert and that man in God's mind was Paul you see God has a thought for every individual before the foundation of the world God thought of you God thought of your situation but God built you to overcome in this age God thought of an age one time he thought of an age where he would be the Dark Ages Dark Ages and and and men and women would be burned at the Stak and they would be thrown in the Lion's death they would be torn in half but God thought of them to overcome in that age they were under the anointing that God thought of them for God had a thought for John Wesley God had a thought for Martin Luther but God gave them an anointing to overcome their age he also had a thought for the final age but he would also provide an anointing that would overcome in that age you are the final age this is the final chapter and God has thought of you as an overcomer in this age and he provided the anointing that we move in to overcome the [Music] enemy God is proving his word through the believer is that right God is proving his word through you God is proving his strength through your weakness God is proving his power even when you don't feel like it even when you don't look like it God has already spoken over you and no matter what the devil says about you now God first spoke over you no matter what you look like now God already sees a perfect view the prophet of God said it like this before the foundation of the world God took a picture of you he took a perfect picture of you he knows what you look like he knows what you are supposed to be you see in this flesh body we have scars we have sickness the pressure of the age has got us a little down a little heavy but that's not the perfect you there is another youth there is another body that body was perfect in the mind of God before there ever was a scar before there ever was a trial there was already a perfect you that is what we're going back to I believe it's not very far away brother Bram said your theophany is not very far away but it's just a few feet above us I believe that's why we enjoy when we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because it brings us higher up and we can we can feel the effect of the theop body you see it's not very far away it's just a few feet [Music] upen that's why God told John come a little higher come a little higher so you can see a little further you see if the devil Keeps Us looking at where we're at and the circumstances around us our eyes are not up our eyes are not looking to the promise if he can distract us to keep our eyes down here our eyes are not where they're supposed to be but there is a perfect you that we are bringing back to by the word I will restore sayith the Lord all of the years that have been taken from you because there's a perfect body waiting for you amen so we recognize this is not a flesh battle but we are made to overcome a spiritual battle we recognize by the word that the weapon is not [Music] ecclesiastical that's not our [Music] [Music] armor but our armor is the revelation of Jesus Christ our armor is it is the rising of the sun our armor is the word that's been sent before us and we come under the anointing of that word that is the armor that we fight under today it's not by head knowledge but it's by revelation of Jesus Christ [Applause] in you who you are now the word made flesh amen so you see you're built different you were constructed different brother Ben would say when she recognizes what what she is she will be an invincible Army so what is she what is the bride she's Christ the anointed ones the Messiah the word he's attacking the word with the word but just like he did with Jesus he didn't know that he was attacking the person of the word he asked the question if thou be if thou be the Son of God he was attacking him he didn't know if he was the son of God he said if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God and he was using the word to attack the person of the word but the person of the word is the word you see in Luke the 4th chapter Jesus is being tempted in the wilderness but he is the word so the devil gives us away his weakness the devil's weakness is this he cannot keep the word he cannot see the word he does not recognize the word it's his weakness in John the 8th chapter Jesus has a conversation with the Pharisees and they tell him we have Abraham to our father he said no you don't have Abraham to your father if Abraham was your father you would know me who is he the word they would have recognized their day and its message but he tells them you are of your father the devil and his work shall you do what are the works of the devil brother brandom teaches us the works of the devil is to H breed the [Music] word he canot keep the word pure he could not keep the word the way that God made the word I think today there's something like 20,000 denominations of this one book is it a problem with the word it's a problem with man's interpretation of the word but the word is of no private interpretation but it's by Revelation that comes from God Almighty to open your eyes to see the word with the spirit of how it was [Music] brought that's what causes division in the message today is they'll say what the prophet said but they won't say it in the same spirit that he preached it in so it's not enough to know what the word is saying but you must have the same Spirit of how the word was brought out amen am you see that is something that the devil cannot do he cannot have the spirit of the word he can keep the letter but the letter kth but the spirit giv life he cannot get to the spirit of the word it's not in him to do it he was not made available to do it he doesn't have the vision to see it but you do amen I me brother bradam said that that Satan Lucifer comes to every church service he's the first one there he listens he tries to understand and when a point is made about a predestinated seed everybody shouts and gets excited and the devil can't understand it why are they so excited I just gave that one diabetes it's okay and he wers why we're still shouting well I I that that person is doesn't have money to go to church why are they shouting that person is sick why are they shouting and while this Revelation is being preached you know what he hears thunder cuz it's not revealed to him but when you hear the word preached and you hear message come forth you don't hear thunder you hear the voice of God to you come up High come out of the Affliction come out of the sickness come out of the darkness and he's leading you by the light you see you are a special class of people predestinated in this age to overcome the devil to overcome him by the word it's already in you everything you need to overcome is already in you God before the foundation of the world put that within you and the devil can't understand it why why are they still here why have they not given up why are they still worshiping why are they still reading the word because there's a seed within [Applause] you and Satan cannot touch the seed he can't touch the life he can't touch the seed within you is that right in job's story touch everything you want but the [Music] life so that tells us that we can go [Music] places where the devil can't follow us we can go places in this [Music] word where the devil can't follow you is that right you were built higher than he was built you were made different than he was made and you can go to places in here that the devil cannot reach you amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so we see that Jesus tells them you're of your father the devil and his works are to hbed the word we see this in the trail of the serpent through the scripture the trail of the serpent Right started in the garden right what did he do he changed the word he hybrid the word he could not keep all the word thereof their father and his Works shall they do Jude would say this in the book of Jude woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of balam for reward and perish in the game saying of Kora Jude is telling us something here all of these men have something in common they were right next to the genuine word right C and abble Bam and Moses K and Moses K and Moses Lucifer and Michael The Serpent and [Music] Adam and [Music] Elijah right Judas and [Music] Jesus but they did their works of their father [Music] they couldn't stay with the word but we are not of their father for we have Abraham to our father and our father's Works shall we do for these works that I do Jesus said shall ye also do you shall also keep the word you will stay with the word you will keep the word it's the works of our father we keep the word the devil cannot do it it's it's not in him to do it brother said that God would have forgiven Cain Cain would have repented but he said it wasn't in him to do it but it's in [Music] you you see the difference the trail of the serpent the trail of the dove every Revival produces twins and the difference in the two twins is one cannot keep the word and one keeps the word hallelujah hallelujah I know what side I'm on I'm on the word keeping side I'm on the stay with the word side hallelujah hallelujah amen God Gave You ability that did not give to Satan God loved Jacob and he hated Esau because Jacob was built to keep the word he wanted the birthright hallelujah hallelujah amen am we'll skip through some of this here you see you were given ability that the devil does not have access to you were given elements that the devil does not have access [Music] to Amen brother Bram says this did you ever read of the urum in the Bible where they looked upon it and that breastplate where God would talk through that breastplate now the devil made a crystal gaze for a substitute for that but the UR and Thum they looked upon it and the lights changed that that's when God would sanct something he says that is a type of the word of God today there's three ways that God talks through the prophet through dreams through the Europe Through the Bible now through Revelation and through the prophet the same way today see this is the hear him here now and then if any dream or any Vision or anything you have does not compare with this it is not God talking but if it's right on this then it's God talking to you so Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever in his church the same Pillar of Fire doing the same signs and [Music] wonders so the prophet is telling us that Satan will try to impersonate this he'll try to impersonate the authority of the word and and we know the story in the scripture where they had built the Tabernacle in the wilderness and they had gotten instructions from God instructions Direction on how to build it hallelujah hallelujah brother I don't know if it's going to be hard for you to translate if you need this in your scripture but we're going to read Exodus 28 are we okay are we okay amen Exodus the 28th chapter brother Bram said the Bible said in the last days the devil will impersonate Christianity so close till it'll deceive the very elected if possible that's right so we must test it how did they test it in their day to the urum Thum the breastplate of Aaron that had those stones in it that represent the birth of these 12 Patriarchs they was in the breastplate of Aaron and when a prophet prophesied that sacred light flashed over it and God said that is the truth no matter how real it seemed if it did not flash on that it was not the truth so the urum and Thum went with the priesthood this Bible is God's urum Thum today and when a prophet prophesies it must absolutely flash with the Bible then God comes down and proves it amen they have to ring true to the blueprint to the plan hallelujah hallelujah so God gave this direction to Moses and it was it was not a helmet it was not a hat it didn't go over the mind but the breastplate goes over the heart Exodus 28:15 time and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work work of the ephod Thou shalt make it of gold of blue of purple of scarlet and of fine twine linen Thou shalt make [Music] [Music] it Four Square it shall be being doubled a span shall be the length thereof and a span shall be the breadth [Music] thereof and thou shalt set sorry and thou shalt set in it settings of stones even four rows of stones the first row shall be sardius a topaz and a carbuncle this shall be the first [Music] row and the second row shall be an admiral the sapphire in a diamond and the third row of the girl and an aot and an [Music] amethyst and the fourth row a barrel and an onx and a Jasper they shall be set in gold in their enclosing and the stone shall be with the names of the children of Israel 12 according to their names like the Engravings of a signant everyone with his name shall be according to the 12 [Music] tribes good yeah that's it 21 amen so we see that God gave Moses instructions and these weren't just just uh just hey build this but they were very specific instructions very very direct instructions on how this urum was to be built because it had to be built just the right way in order for the lights to flash across it and ring the right color amen we understand amen so God told Moses specific this is how it is built it must be fashion just this [Music] way it's got to be just in this line with all these colors and in gold and when when the word is brought before it it will it will tell you if it's the true word or a false word so God has a [Music] plan we don't have to guess what is the true word but God provided a way that we would know what the pure word of God is it will ring true the color will flash across the word now we are not under a man's interpretation but we are under God's interpretation of the word and if it do doesn't vindicate itself it's not the pure word of God but if it is Vindicated then it is God's voice itself coming to the [Applause] church hallelujah hallelujah we're not just following some man's fables but this message of the hour has been Vindicated and Vindicated and Vindicated and Vindicated I think somebody back home did a count a count on tape how many times that the prophet discerned an individual and some of those discernments were 22 different items in one [Music] discernment over 8,300 times on tape Vindicated discernment coming forth so if he Vindicated the first and the second poll God has also Vindicated the third pole because the word lines up with the word there's no problem with the word but we have a man problem where men have gotten into the interpretation of the word but we are going back to the original word to the original Faith man didn't have his hand in it man did not have his hand in it but it was God speaking to man watch the phase of the ministry of William brandom God gave him such a powerful gift of discernment that one individual would come and he would tell them 20 different things [Music] it's [Music] okay he was not guessing he was not guessing but he was Discerning the intense of the Heart Right Jesus was not guessing with the woman at the well but he was Discerning her heart so in the third phase of brother benham's Ministry he was not just Discerning anybody's heart but he was turning his attention to the Heart of Jesus Christ and revealing the secrets of the heart revealing the secrets of the heart he was not guessing but he was in the heart of God expressing to us what God thinks about us he was not guessing like he knew the heart of God concerning you hallelujah hallelujah it rang across the Europe it flashed across the Europe it was the Vindicated word of God it has told us what God thinks about us for I know the thoughts that I think towards you are thoughts of good there are thoughts of peace our thoughts to an expected end God already knows what he thinks about you and through the message of the hour we know what God thinks about us hallelujah hallelujah he made a way of Escape for us that the devil cannot follow he can try to imp person he could try to mimic it but he can never be the real thing Satan can never be the real believer it's not in him to do it Hallelujah brother says Esau represented the man of the Earth religious but never able it was not in him to do it he could not do it it was never in him to climb past the things of the world the carnal thing but for Jacob it was so easy for him to do it one purpose Jacob had and that was that he longed for the birthright no matter how he got it he got it amen it was not in [Music] Esau he literally was not built the same as Jacob was built Cain literally was not built the same Abel was [Music] built something was missing something was missing in Esau Abel had something that Cain did not have Jacob had something that Esau did not have he was built different hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are built different than any other age before us this is the eagle age you can fly higher than any other age before [Music] you you are literally built different than anyone else else that has come before you if you try to get another bird to follow an eagle follow an eagle he can't fly that high brother B said he will start to shake he will he will explode under the pressure he's not built the same as an eagle but you were built you were made higher you were made to climb higher than where the devil can follow you he cannot follow you into the heights of the world he cannot walk where you can walk it's literally not in him to do it it's not in him but it's in you he came cannot keep the word but you [Music] can turn with me to Ezekiel the 28th chapter hope this is okay are we okay we okay he said we just have one service so I'm just taking my time is that okay amen amen okay praise the lord it's a good good Pulpit to preach from I amen you got Ezekiel 28 yeah okay the 11th verse we're going to show through the scripture how that you were built different than Lucifer was built moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the 11th verse said of man take up a lamentation upon the king of [Music] Tyrus and saith unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou seest up the PM full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty brother Bram tells us this is speaking of Lucifer the king of Tyrus thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God and every precious stone was that [Music] covering the sardius the topaz the diamond the barrel the onx The Jasper the sappire the emerald the car and gold the Workman ship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created so he had a beginning Lucifer had a beginning in the day thou was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created until until iniquity was found he had a beginning all things that have a beginning shall have an end he's built different than you're built he was he was created after you see we never had a moment where we began but we were always in the mind of God we were always in the mind of Elohim so before there ever was was a Lucifer you already were before there ever was a trial you already were before there ever was a Leia you already were in the mind of Elohim we came before you are older than the devil [Music] you had no beginning and you will have no way because you came from your father and you go back to your father no ending of days but you always will be hallelujah hallelujah there's no end to you those in the passed on in the grave they're not dead but they sleepeth there's no end to a thought of God it always was and always will be Eternal are the thoughts of [Applause] godam says the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they always were and they always will be he's built different than you're built in Exodus that we read the 28th chapter we counted 12 Stones is that right one for each tribe there were 12 Stones on the breastplate in four rows 12 Stones in Ezekiel the 28th chapter we just read how that he was created and I don't think that God's bad at math God's not bad at math he knows how to do math there's only nine there's only nine in in in Moses's direction to build the breastplate 12 when Jesus when God is is speaking through Ezekiel he says how that Lucifer was created something's missing you are literally built different than Lucifer was built God designs you different than he designed Lucifer so you can go places that Lucifer cannot go he cannot reach you in the word he cannot keep the word hallelujah hallelujah Lucifer is missing the third row of stones he doesn't have it it's not in him the the word will never flash across him the color will never show across it because he doesn't have all of the [Music] stones he's missing three [Music] stones hallelujah hallelujah the first of the stone that he's missing is the lur Stone are we okay are we together the first stone he's missing is the L [Music] stone it comes from the tribe of G it's it's an amber [Music] color it it means it means a judge to be Vindicated or loosed this stone represents overcoming power I've taken this from where the tribes are represented in the scripture this represents overcoming power the devil does not have it he does not have overcoming power it's not in his [Music] creation why are you still here this morning what's brought you here this morning over your trial over your disappointments over your heartaches heart heartaches you have overcoming power it's already in you the devil doesn't understand because it's not in him but it is in you that's how you're here this morning because God built you with overcoming power hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he cannot impersonate it he can try Judas tried Jud Judas I'll just read from Brother brandham here are we okay Judas could have done all kind of signs and wonders but when he come to receive the holy ghost at the day of Pentecost he showed his color he couldn't do it he could not do it the devil can come right up and impersonate almost the very thing until it comes to the word he cannot impersonate the word it's not in him to do it he cannot take all the word maybe one word like Eve did the devil did to Eve but he can't cross it all because the only thing that can do it is the body of Christ ah hallelujah hallelujah the devil's in trouble they they could not cannot take the message now neither could jambus and Janice take Moses's message they could not do it their works of impersonation was made known because they could not be able to follow God's word Vindicated by his anointed Prophet it wasn't in them so what is that that tell us brother you believe the message of the hour believe it's a Vindicated word you're not an impersonator if you can keep the word you're not an impersonator you're the genuine article you're the real deal you're the real thing because wherever there's a false there's the real wherever there's impersonation there's a genuine you the body of Christ are the genuine article of the word it's in you it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness it's in [Music] you the next stone that he missing is the egged stone that represents the tribe of naftali which means through difficulty it's a common Stone they're not real valuable they have no value but there's one way to know how it's a real egged Stone there's only one way they take this EG Stone brother stepen and how they can tell it apart from the other Stones is they put it over a fire and with the light of the fire coming through the [Music] stone it casts an amber light out from the stone the devil does not have it the tribe represents through difficulty the devil does not have it you know how we know we have it put it under a fire you want to see a real believer shine put him in the fire you want to know if you really have an experience with the walk through the fire go into the fire with God and let his light shine through you that you can manifest the word in this hour it's in you to do it the three Hebrew children had the same and they went into the fire the king sent his mightiest men his his greatest soldiers his greatest soldiers strongest soldiers to take the Hebrew children to the fire is that right he said turn it up seven times hotter you see how dumb the devil is he sent his mightiest soldiers to and take a real believer into the fire but they couldn't stand the fire those soldiers could not stand the fire only the Believers with stod the fire because the stone was in them because God made a way for them to go somewhere the devil could not go with them hallelujah hallelujah he couldn't go into the fire with he was too hot you see there's a fire between you and your [Music] miracle miracle there's a fire between you and your overcoming the devil can't walk with you through the fire he cannot walk through the fire not built to do it you know what the prophet of God said the only thing the fire did for the Believers was they loose their bands hallel Hallelujah why would he want their bands loosed cuz we were made to be like this we were made to worship made to praise him you're made to give him glory there's a fire between you and your [Applause] Miracle they would come in the prayer line with brother brandham and they would come under the anointing of that Pillar of Fire and he would tell them you recognize there's something between us said do you feel that yes there's something between us it was the pillar of fire brother brandham never healed one person it was the pillar of fire on this side of the prayer line on this side of the prayer line they had canc they they had cancer walking from this side of the platform to this side of the platform no cancer what was it that did that it was the pillar of fire it was the same fire that's here today there's a pillar of fire between holding you that you can walk through the fire with God come and walk with me for a while fire and as they talked on their way their hearts begin to burn it was the pillar of fire the opening of the word to them begin to release them hallelujah hallelujah walk through the fire with God and you'll stand the test of the word Satan cannot follow you there it's not in him to do it he doesn't have it hallelujah hallelujah that's why job could rejoice in the midst of his suffering there's a fire Hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah wonderful brother brandom says that what was it in the in the Lion's Den that protected Daniel the same time the Hebrew children were in the furnace the same time Daniel was in the Lion's dead the prophet told us a fire came down into the Lion's Den with Daniels and it held back the Lions why because they're afraid of fire every Beast is afraid of fire why because it's not in them to walk through the fire that's why the serpent nature is afraid to walk through the fire with God no I've missed it that's why the serpent Beast nature is afraid to walk through the fire it's not in him to do [Music] it but that's where the value comes out that's where the value of the real believer shines life's easy when we're on the mountain when we're on the mountain life is easy life is easy anybody can shine but when you're in the valley when you're in the fire when you're in the trial that's when the real value of a Believer comes out that's when the value shines that's when the value sh yeah through the trial of our faith I counsel thee to buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire the end time believer tried in the fire hallelujah hallelujah wonderful then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew what bed and time you'd be [Music] planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's right you were done there before the foundation of the world and if it was wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it how can you get blood in a turnup vegetable there's no blood in a vegetable in a vegetable brother Bam's he has broken English like me you you cannot impersonate this you were chosen in God's mind before the foundation of the world and all those that were not chosen to God's will never meet the challenge of the hour only the real bride believer will meet the [Applause] challenge the word test it's your position the mother of the sons of thunder in the scripture the mothers of the sons of thunder they call them in the scripture she asked Jesus she says can my sons sit at your right hand he says that position has not yet been given the said because the test had not yet come because that's your position he couldn't give your position to the to the sons because you had not yet come now the test of the word has come to him that overcometh this age will I grant to sit with me on my father's Throne your position has already been spoken for the test of the trial is now there's a trial between you and your rightful [Applause] position hallelujah hallelujah I'll try to close here try to bring this down we got one more Stone the amethyst stone represents [Music] humility the devil St does not have it he can impersonate it he can try to seem humble but he cannot humble himself to to the [Music] word but you can it's in you to humble yourself to the word now it's easy for man to Humble themselves to a lie to a lie a lie maybe someone that was young in school and somebody at your school 30 years ago told you you were ugly ugly and you've humbled yourself to that lie and it built a complex and have humility to a lie the devil's told you that you're not going to make it that you don't have enough faith that you're just gonna you're just going to be here one day and everybody's going to be gone he's a liar why humble yourself to a lie when you can humble yourself to the truth that tells you that you already made it tells you you already have the faith it tells you that you are an overcomer I tells you that he's already paid the price and tells you he's already made the way why don't we humble ourselves to the word and get underneath the headship of [Applause] it says we have not come together to talk about the message just to talk about it or to debate about the message debate argue but we have come to get underneath the message humbling ourselves to the word humbling yourself to the word the devil canot do it he can't follow you into the word he doesn't know when he is attacking you he's attacking the word how did Jesus defeat him in the wilderness did he call down stones from Heaven did he turn the stone into bread no because you or I might not be able to do that maybe we could not do that but how he defeated him was by the word you and I can do that we can do that we have the word the word is in the bride see is the word she can defeat the Devil she will do the Greater Works she will overcome she will manifest the word the son of man is already here the word bride we're not feeding on stones or bread we are not feeding on stones or bread we are feeding on the body word son of [Applause] man opening of the word has come we are in it get in the word become the word let it consume you our God is a consuming fire get in the word [Applause] he didn't know the devil did not know how to use the scripture but when he flew in on Jesus he said it is written Jesus said it is also written you mean you can take that scripture and tie it with that scripture it is written it is also written you mean you can tie that scripture with this scripture he didn't know what is the commission of this age to tie together all the loose ends to tie scripture upon scripture upon scripture upon scripture and take this and take this and take this and take this and take this and through the anointing of the Prophet messenger he took the entire Bible and tied it together the devil doesn't know how to do that he cannot make it dub tail he canot join it together but our prophet's commission was to take the Loose Ends and bring them together and tie them together and tie them together a loose end here in Uganda and a loose end here in America and tie it together scripture from here and tie it together and out of this denomination pull one and tie it together I was a loose end but when the voice came to me it brought me in and TI me the scripture this is the day of the fullness of the word the fullness of the word has come it's time we get underneath it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah please stand you can go ahead and stand hallelujah hallelujah you are built different than Lucifer [Music] is do you know why the angels will be silent when we get there because they're built different than we're built they have not walked through the fire that we have walked [Applause] through they cannot worship like you can worship a heavenly host of angels cannot sing like you can sing because it's not in them to do it but through the tri of your faith you have come to a revelation of Amazing Grace you know why you're worshiping you know he deserves all the glory and honor you can give him because he's taken you through the fire our God is a consuming [Applause] fire let us be consumed by him let us be absorbed by him let him become our everything let this word become alive in us that we might make manifest The Works of God hallelujah hallelu consume us Lord with the fire of your spirit hallelu you I love Hallelujah

Omega in between here we thank God for the blood isn't that wonderful keep the word the devil can never keep the word just stay that word your nature is to keep the word amen first pool and second pool the prophet would tell us what is in our hearts but God raised him to the third pole and in the third pole Into the Heart of Christ and tell us what he thinks of us isn't that wonderful amen he looks Into the Heart of Christ and he says I've loved you from before the foundation of the world that I have chosen you from before the foundation of the world that you will never fail was a son always a son the Declarations of the third pool that you will make [Music] it isn't that wonderful praise the Lord he has chosen us from before the foundation of the world all these trials you are going through they are not going to bring you down because God has placed you in the nature amen eternally the nature to worship but the nature of Lucifer to worship was just a nature of necessity somebody to come and be able to praise God and he had the ability to fall the nature on the side of you was in you from before the foundation of the world it is known of God is to be like a god why
