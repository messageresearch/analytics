[26:07] PR
[26:12] Hallelujah from
[26:16] the of
[26:18] [Music]
[26:24] s them in
[26:29] with the
[26:32] wondering to
[26:35] [Music]
[26:37] J when Jesus was
[26:41] here he
[26:43] baptized but he never baptized the
[26:48] child whoever he
[26:51] baptized were people that were
[26:54] [Music]
[26:55] mature John baptized
[26:58] he never baptized
[27:00] children because the principle
[27:04] is he that
[27:07] repent and is
[27:09] baptized shall be
[27:12] saved so a child cannot
[27:16] repent because the scripture
[27:19] says repent and be
[27:22] baptized every one of you and be
[27:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:29] Christ for the remission of your sin and
[27:32] you shall receive the
[27:34] gift of the Holy Ghost so we are
[27:38] happy by the grace of
[27:41] God to have an
[27:44] opportunity to dedicate a baby this
[27:47] morning we do
[27:50] this to give this
[27:52] child into the hands of
[27:55] God until God speaks to him
[27:59] to repent his
[28:01] sins and be saved just like
[28:06] Samuel when he was born he was given
[28:10] into the hands of the
[28:13] ministry was dedicated to
[28:16] Eli and then what
[28:19] happens when the time came God spoke to
[28:24] Samuel by the word of the Lord
[28:28] dedicate this
[28:29] [Music]
[28:36] baby so in the hands here I have W
[28:44] Jonathan

[39:46] 120
[39:50] [Music]
[39:52] years and then it came down to
[39:55] [Music]
[39:56] 1 and today it's 40
[39:59] years a
[40:01] generation bially is 40
[40:06] years so this generation May mean I mean
[40:10] a generation May
[40:12] mean the
[40:14] 40 uh calendar
[40:22] years but according to the
[40:25] Bible we must know that a
[40:29] generation is not an empty span of 40
[40:34] years it involves people in the span of
[40:38] the 40
[40:41] years so when we are talking about a
[40:45] generation we are talking about a period
[40:47] of 40
[40:49] years together with the people that live
[40:53] in that period of 40 years
[40:57] so by involving the
[41:00] people we are really looking at their
[41:03] way of
[41:05] life because the scripture
[41:08] sometimes speaks about a generation in
[41:12] various
[41:14] ways it is specifically speaking about
[41:19] people the ways of their
[41:22] Liv and not just an empty span of those
[41:25] 40 years
[41:29] so this
[41:30] generation is referred to as an evil and
[41:34] wicked
[41:38] generation so the years
[41:41] alone without a
[41:43] people cannot really give meaning to an
[41:46] evil and wicked
[41:51] generation is the people walking away
[41:55] from the path of righteousness
[41:59] they break ranks with the
[42:01] word amen children are not raised under
[42:04] the
[42:06] word the parents just don't care about
[42:09] what they are bringing
[42:11] for marriages break over very simple
[42:16] things you know the generation goes into
[42:19] the worship of the
[42:23] Stars amen because down there in
[42:26] Hollywood
[42:27] we've got what they call the
[42:30] Stars
[42:34] amen amen so people just copy the ways
[42:39] they live their
[42:42] lives they watch the
[42:45] sportsmen see how they
[42:47] dress go after
[42:50] them the word has been put
[42:54] aside so an evil and wicked
[42:59] generation means the
[43:01] people who are wickedly soiled in a
[43:05] period of 40
[43:09] years now we see in the
[43:13] scriptures that after the unbelief
[43:18] atesh amen God
[43:21] saw that the entire
[43:25] group that came from
[43:27] Egypt from the age of
[43:31] 20 never enter into the
[43:34] promise okay now I'll go down to the
[43:37] Book of
[43:39] Numbers chapter
[43:41] 32 and verse
[43:43] 11 he say surely none of the men that
[43:46] came up out of
[43:50] Egypt from the 20 years old and upward
[43:57] shall see the land which I saw unto
[44:04] Abraham is
[44:07] Jacob because they have not only
[44:10] followed
[44:12] me but later he called those people a
[44:18] generation Amen in that's
[44:22] verse3 he says here the Lord's anger was
[44:26] kindled against
[44:29] Israel and he made them Wonder in the
[44:32] wilderness 40
[44:36] years until all the
[44:41] generation that had done evil in the
[44:44] sight of the Lord was
[44:48] consumed so when he
[44:50] says this generation shall not pass
[44:55] away amen until all these things be
[45:00] fulfilled he covers the
[45:04] people amen that you know would see
[45:09] Israel become a
[45:12] nation amen and therefore that
[45:16] generation covers up from
[45:21] 1948 to
[45:24] 1988 are you together with me
[45:27] till all these things be
[45:32] fulfilled now when we talk about a
[45:35] generation
[45:36] here we can as well include the
[45:41] children that have been born into the
[45:45] period of
[45:46] time and today we can say the children
[45:50] of that
[45:52] generation are only 36 years
[45:59] do you understand what I mean they are
[46:02] only 36
[46:04] years so now here I mean the
[46:10] scriptures they
[46:12] speak about these
[46:15] things and when they speak about these
[46:18] things they are talking about quite a
[46:21] number of
[46:24] issues amen so let's go to m
[46:29] 24 verse one he says and Jesus went
[46:34] out and departed from the
[46:37] temple and his disciples came to him for
[46:40] to show him the buildings of the
[46:46] temple and Jesus said unto
[46:49] them see ye not all these
[46:53] things verily I say unto you
[46:57] there shall not
[47:00] be left here one stone upon
[47:06] another that shall not be thrown
[47:09] down and as it sat
[47:12] down upon the Mount of
[47:15] Olives the disciples came unto him
[47:20] privately saying tell us when shall
[47:24] these things be
[47:33] amen and what shall be the sign of thy
[47:38] coming end of the
[47:42] world now Jesus was coming to
[47:47] Jerusalem for the first
[47:50] time and he was coming to the closing of
[47:55] his Corporal Ministry
[48:01] and it is
[48:03] here where speaks about the
[48:07] times and the signs of the
[48:11] end when shall these things
[48:15] be one question what shall be the sign
[48:19] of thy
[48:21] coming two
[48:23] questions and of the end of the world
[48:29] three
[48:30] questions so we made
[48:34] mistake when we try to
[48:37] apply all these three
[48:40] questions to the coming of the
[48:43] Lord he says when shall these things
[48:48] be that we speaking about the time
[48:52] frame to the coming of the Lord to which
[48:56] the
[48:57] answer is literally no man knows the
[49:02] de so we just need to leave the
[49:05] life because it is
[49:08] us who must be
[49:10] ready before he can
[49:13] come are you together with me he's long
[49:18] suffering and the scripture says the law
[49:21] I mean the
[49:22] bride has made herself ready
[49:27] you know as a
[49:29] bridegroom you cannot just go and marry
[49:32] a lady who is not
[49:36] ready so even the
[49:39] master has to prepare his
[49:42] bride and when she is
[49:45] ready then he can come and pick
[49:49] her to the marriage so the bride has to
[49:53] make herself ready
[49:57] and you know what happens about these
[50:00] marriages the bridegroom can come to
[50:02] church at 10:00 in the
[50:07] morning but then the the
[50:09] bride is very
[50:12] careful about how this looks
[50:15] like and then she can run back to the
[50:19] saloon because there is a little bit of
[50:21] a bridge
[50:23] here she has to be ready
[50:27] before she presents
[50:29] her self for the marriage amen let's go
[50:33] to Mark
[50:35] chapter and verse
[50:38] 32 but of the
[50:41] day and that hour knoweth no
[50:48] man not the Angels which are in
[50:52] heaven neither the
[50:54] son but the father
[50:57] take
[50:59] he watch and
[51:01] pray so you know not when the time
[51:06] is we do not know the hour so we need to
[51:11] continue living a
[51:13] life of
[51:16] Consecration and waiting in
[51:18] prayer streaming our
[51:22] lamps amen and you know Jesus in
[51:26] Jerusalem
[51:28] was going around a magnificent
[51:32] Temple and that Temple was the pride of
[51:39] Israel because it took 47 years in
[51:44] building but then this
[51:46] Temple was brought
[51:50] down
[51:53] in7 in7
[52:06] by a Roman general called
[52:11] Titus and then the
[52:13] Jews were dis passed all over the
[52:17] world because this man
[52:20] completely wrecked
[52:24] Jerusalem so what does this mean it
[52:28] means that the signs of the coming of
[52:30] the
[52:33] [Music]
[52:35] Lord spins a long period of
[52:39] time amen until the
[52:43] unbeliever will say since the days of
[52:47] our
[52:49] fathers the things continue the
[52:52] same where is he where is his coming
[52:56] the
[52:57] signs started getting
[53:00] fulfilled as far away as
[53:06] A7 so remember the three
[53:09] questions when shall these things
[53:13] be amen the coming of the
[53:16] Lord amen what shall be the sign of thy
[53:21] coming and the end of the world so three
[53:25] questions were asked
[53:28] but the answers show us that you know it
[53:32] takes a long
[53:35] time from when the signs started being
[53:39] fulfilled to the coming of
[53:42] Messiah but I want tell you that
[53:46] today all the signs have been
[53:51] fulfilled so we are living in the
[53:55] periods of coming of the
[53:57] Lord he may come today he may come
[54:02] tomorrow he may come 10 years he may
[54:05] come 50 years he's Sovereign he's
[54:09] waiting for you to prepare yourself to
[54:12] the
[54:13] come amen so Matthew 24
[54:18] verse4 and Jesus answered and said unto
[54:22] them take he that no man deceive you
[54:28] for many shall come in my
[54:32] name saying I am
[54:37] anointed amen I am
[54:40] anointed amen because to be
[54:44] anointed is to be a
[54:47] Christ not the
[54:50] Christ but to be a
[54:52] Christ to enjoy the same anointing
[54:57] that Christ had so many shall
[55:00] come in my name saying I am
[55:04] Christ and shall deceive
[55:07] many so the spirit of
[55:10] deception backed up with the
[55:13] anointing would be so
[55:16] rampant in the seasons and the
[55:20] times of his coming it will be so
[55:24] rampant everybody will claim a
[55:28] gift this one will claim a form of
[55:31] anointing another one will will claim a
[55:35] certain level of capacity of
[55:38] ministry that people would claim
[55:42] anointing as they take others away from
[55:46] the true Bible
[55:50] teaching because it is not the teaching
[55:54] that will lead the people
[55:58] in the end time the people will follow
[56:02] the
[56:03] anointing so this is where the danger is
[56:07] now any man who wants to start a good
[56:11] church we always talk about
[56:14] anointing we have got the anointing here
[56:18] and the anointing according to
[56:20] them is how they
[56:22] scream how they shout how they are so
[56:26] in
[56:28] service but the anointing according to
[56:31] the
[56:32] Lord isem power under
[56:36] control
[56:50] am when it's
[56:52] raining that's the true
[56:54] anointing amen
[56:57] I remember
[56:58] Christ was seated in the
[57:01] temple and I don't know for what
[57:04] reasons a priest came
[57:07] along gave him this the Bible and when
[57:10] he gave him the
[57:12] Bible I think let us stand
[57:15] together and look at that
[57:17] scripture that's the Book of
[57:20] Luke amen are you there now yes sir The
[57:25] Book of Luke
[57:27] chter
[57:28] 4
[57:34] amen so let's read from
[57:38] 16 and he came to
[57:41] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[57:45] and as his custom
[57:47] was I love some
[57:50] customs the Lord had some
[57:53] customs how many of you have customs
[57:57] as his custom was he had to be in the
[58:00] house of the
[58:01] Lord on the
[58:03] Sabbath is that your
[58:06] custom it's a very good one he went into
[58:10] the synagogue on the Sabbath
[58:13] day and stood up for to
[58:18] read and there was delivered unto him
[58:21] the book of the prophet
[58:24] Isaiah and when he adoped the book he
[58:28] found a place where it was
[58:31] written the
[58:33] spirit of the
[58:36] Lord is upon me but he was
[58:40] still he was not nodding his
[58:43] head he was not running around he was
[58:47] not jumping up and down he was not
[58:50] screaming but the spirit of the Lord is
[58:54] upon me
[58:56] amen he has anointed
[58:59] me to preach the gospel to the
[59:03] poor he has sent me to heal the
[59:08] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[59:11] the
[59:13] captives and recovering of sight to the
[59:17] blind to set at Liberty them that he
[59:22] that are bruised
[59:26] to preach the acceptable of the
[59:31] Lord
[59:36] 19 and he closed the
[59:38] book gave it back again to the
[59:42] minister he sat down and the eyes of all
[59:46] them that were in the
[59:49] synagogue were fastened on
[59:52] him and he began to say
[59:57] this day this
[1:00:00] scripture is fulfilled
[1:00:03] you what was
[1:00:06] fulfilled the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:00:09] me I am
[1:00:12] anointed did you have thr on the
[1:00:15] ground to prove that no
[1:00:18] sir the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:00:23] but the scripture
[1:00:24] says in the end time amen the many
[1:00:29] people come saying I am
[1:00:33] anointed
[1:00:35] amen so the
[1:00:37] nature actually what begins
[1:00:40] here let's go back to now let's get to
[1:00:43] Matthew
[1:00:44] here amen chapter
[1:00:47] 24 verse 6 we are looking at the
[1:00:51] sign and you shall hear the
[1:00:54] Ws and rumors of
[1:00:57] wars see that he be not
[1:01:00] troubled for all these
[1:01:03] things must come to
[1:01:05] pass but the end is not
[1:01:09] yet Nations shall rise against
[1:01:13] nations against
[1:01:15] Kingdom there shall be
[1:01:18] feminist
[1:01:20] penes
[1:01:22] earthquakes in diverse
[1:01:24] places all these the beginning of
[1:01:31] Sorrow he says those things will start
[1:01:35] systematically
[1:01:37] happen so the
[1:01:39] nature and the
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:47] cosmos would begin to spiral
[1:01:54] downward whoo
[1:01:57] rumors of
[1:01:58] wars nations against
[1:02:02] Nations
[1:02:04] penes amen
[1:02:07] ask amen and he says back that will be
[1:02:11] the beginning of
[1:02:13] sorrow and this season of
[1:02:16] Sorrow comes because the people have
[1:02:20] fallen
[1:02:21] away from the leadership of the world
[1:02:26] not listen to God
[1:02:27] anymore amen so Paul tells
[1:02:32] Timothy in second Timothy chter
[1:02:35] 3 and verse one I'll give you quite a
[1:02:39] few scriptures today I want you to go
[1:02:42] back and study through
[1:02:45] them he says this know
[1:02:49] also that in the last
[1:02:52] days the realest times shall
[1:02:58] come there will be hard
[1:03:01] TI there will be a social
[1:03:06] breakdown so you keep looking at
[1:03:09] things and little you know they are
[1:03:15] signs of the coming of the
[1:03:18] Lord amen in verse three says for men
[1:03:22] shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:03:28] who cares about who
[1:03:30] any who cares what you do or you don't
[1:03:34] do they will be
[1:03:37] Busters
[1:03:39] proud
[1:03:41] blasphemers disobedient to
[1:03:44] parents unth
[1:03:46] thankful and
[1:03:48] holy without natural
[1:03:52] affection did you hear what I say that
[1:03:56] feeling for
[1:03:58] another will completely come to
[1:04:02] zero without natural
[1:04:05] affection they
[1:04:08] break
[1:04:12] agreements F
[1:04:15] choosers they don't care what they say
[1:04:17] about
[1:04:18] you they incontinent they Fierce
[1:04:21] despisers of those that are good
[1:04:27] Paul was describing the community as it
[1:04:32] is
[1:04:34] today and he says they are
[1:04:37] traitors they play between the
[1:04:40] people they are head high
[1:04:44] minded LS of
[1:04:48] pleasure more than the lovers of
[1:04:51] God did you hear that if there is a big
[1:04:54] thing out there
[1:04:57] brother you need to be a
[1:04:58] Christian because they want to go with
[1:05:01] something which has got some form of
[1:05:02] pleasure in
[1:05:04] it and having a
[1:05:07] form of
[1:05:09] godliness but denying the power
[1:05:14] thereof he says from
[1:05:17] such turn
[1:05:19] away why because those are signs of the
[1:05:24] coming of the Lord
[1:05:26] amen so having a form of
[1:05:29] godliness claiming the
[1:05:32] anointing but yet denying the
[1:05:37] power of
[1:05:39] transformation I want the power I want
[1:05:42] the anointing but I don't want the
[1:05:47] transformation that the word
[1:05:50] brings amen praise the Lord let's go to
[1:05:54] Matthew 24
[1:05:56] amen verse 9 and
[1:05:58] 10 still looking at what shall this end
[1:06:01] of these things be you know then shall
[1:06:04] they deliver
[1:06:06] you to be
[1:06:10] afflicted and shall kill you and he
[1:06:14] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[1:06:16] name's
[1:06:20] sake and then shall many be offended
[1:06:26] and shall betray one
[1:06:28] another and shall hate one
[1:06:31] another but
[1:06:33] remember El does not
[1:06:37] pers amen once you get that kind of
[1:06:43] inclination Amen to get into
[1:06:47] temptation so that you can uh
[1:06:51] prute another
[1:06:53] brother elect
[1:06:56] does not
[1:06:58] persecute it's not
[1:07:01] Christ who reported the fares to
[1:07:06] Herod but the
[1:07:08] Pharisees and the ones who reported
[1:07:10] Christ to
[1:07:12] Herod amen it's not the
[1:07:15] Pharisees that stand before PIR in
[1:07:20] trial it's Christ who stood there so we
[1:07:24] have the quot
[1:07:26] does
[1:07:28] not but you don't have the right
[1:07:32] either to prute a man who is not a
[1:07:36] Believer amen praise the Lord verse 11
[1:07:40] says and many false prophet shall rise
[1:07:44] and shall deceive
[1:07:48] many so the rise of anointed men in the
[1:07:51] end time
[1:07:55] shall be
[1:07:57] enous but none of these
[1:07:59] men shall Point people to
[1:08:04] Christ amen are you together with me
[1:08:08] they just tell
[1:08:10] people how blessed they
[1:08:12] are they will tell people how they will
[1:08:16] rule the
[1:08:17] world they just tell the people how
[1:08:20] their families are going to be
[1:08:23] blessed I tell you family will
[1:08:26] blessed your jobs will be
[1:08:29] blessed everybody you come
[1:08:32] across will realize you are a son of
[1:08:36] God and that will be the level of their
[1:08:40] Ministry anointing will not take
[1:08:44] people into fellowship with
[1:08:47] Christ amen much as they bring the
[1:08:51] people to
[1:08:52] church but I'm talking about taking them
[1:08:56] beyond the
[1:08:58] church personal relationship with
[1:09:02] Christ amen so Israel became a
[1:09:06] nation in
[1:09:09] 1948 and we know that this
[1:09:12] generation
[1:09:14] shall not pass away until all these
[1:09:19] things be
[1:09:21] fulfilled then shall come our Christ
[1:09:28] are you together with me okay in Luke
[1:09:31] chapter
[1:09:33] 21 verse
[1:09:35] 29 and he SP to them
[1:09:40] aable hallelujah hallelujah amen and he
[1:09:44] SP to them a
[1:09:46] parable behold the Fig
[1:09:50] Tree and all the trees
[1:09:56] now he's being very specific
[1:10:00] here but the will come
[1:10:04] time when God will deal with the Fig
[1:10:09] Tree and all the
[1:10:13] trees are you together with me and we
[1:10:16] know that the Fig Tree speaks about
[1:10:20] Israel is that amen when they now should
[1:10:25] f
[1:10:29] you see and know of your own selves that
[1:10:33] summer is now
[1:10:40] at so there comes a
[1:10:43] time when both the Fig
[1:10:47] Tree which is a unique
[1:10:50] tree specifically recognized by God
[1:10:56] and all other
[1:10:58] trees which speaks about the Gentile
[1:11:02] churches they come to a time when they
[1:11:07] begin to Bloom
[1:11:12] together are you together with me listen
[1:11:15] to what brother Bram
[1:11:16] say now they watch for it in the
[1:11:22] generation amen they
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] what what he talking
[1:11:35] about not at all listen he
[1:11:39] said the generation that see the Fig
[1:11:43] Tree putting forth its
[1:11:47] bird amen now
[1:11:50] watch he said the f tree and all other
[1:11:58] trees now in other words there would be
[1:12:02] a universal Revival at the
[1:12:09] time amen praise the Lord sometimes we
[1:12:14] would see the Revival in
[1:12:17] Israel and then sometimes we see the
[1:12:20] Revival among the
[1:12:22] Gentiles but in the end time
[1:12:26] amen there will be a
[1:12:29] Revival both in Israel and all other
[1:12:33] Gentile
[1:12:34] churches this day this scripture is
[1:12:40] fulfilled amen he
[1:12:43] said he gave them a parable behold the
[1:12:47] Fig
[1:12:48] Tree and all other
[1:12:51] trees when they now sh
[1:12:53] forth you see and know of your own s
[1:12:59] that
[1:12:59] Su is now
[1:13:03] at and what with Summer
[1:13:06] now
[1:13:08] summer is the season for the
[1:13:13] Harvest are you together with me he says
[1:13:17] when you see
[1:13:18] them begin to buy begin to bring
[1:13:23] forth the seed in the
[1:13:26] here amen then you will know that the
[1:13:30] time of the
[1:13:32] Harvest is very
[1:13:35] close amen so the generation that sees
[1:13:39] the Fig
[1:13:41] Tree putting forth its
[1:13:45] birs and all other trees putting forth
[1:13:48] their
[1:13:50] B which means
[1:13:52] Israel in a Revival
[1:13:56] and the
[1:13:57] Gentiles amen having their
[1:14:00] Revival so this generation here shall
[1:14:04] not pass away till all these things be
[1:14:09] fulfilled amen so we say the
[1:14:14] generation is a period of
[1:14:17] years and the people they
[1:14:21] are so imagine the people were born in
[1:14:25] the
[1:14:30] generation and the age actually ends in
[1:14:34] 48 I mean
[1:14:40] 88 so if there was anybody born in
[1:14:47] 1988 is only 36
[1:14:52] years I want to say we are
[1:14:56] close to the coming of the
[1:14:58] Lord I don't de in
[1:15:01] years but I deal in realities of
[1:15:06] issues now listen to what brother Bram
[1:15:10] says Not only was the
[1:15:13] Jews the Fig Tree to put forth his
[1:15:18] bir but other
[1:15:21] trees and every
[1:15:23] church has had a
[1:15:26] Revival amen have been for the last few
[1:15:32] years the
[1:15:33] Pentecostal you had your
[1:15:36] Revival the Baptist their Revival
[1:15:41] Presbyterians has got a Revival and the
[1:15:44] Jews are returning to
[1:15:47] Palestine the generation shall not pass
[1:15:50] away till all be fulfilled
[1:15:57] praise the Lord so both categories of
[1:16:01] trees have been lamped
[1:16:04] together in the same
[1:16:07] season in the end
[1:16:09] time amen I'm trying to bring something
[1:16:13] out because we are talking about
[1:16:18] stability you see it's until you see the
[1:16:22] season that you begin to prepare
[1:16:26] yourself is that
[1:16:28] amen yeah when Daniel understood by
[1:16:33] books he moved into
[1:16:38] prayer unless we know our prophetic
[1:16:43] season we cannot know our prophetic
[1:16:48] claim and when you see anything by way
[1:16:51] of scripture
[1:16:55] then you've got a right to claim
[1:17:00] it you'll have a right to claim for a
[1:17:05] Revival knowing what season we are
[1:17:09] living amen both categories of trees
[1:17:12] were L
[1:17:14] together has been that when God is
[1:17:17] dealing with
[1:17:19] Israel he puts the Gentiles aside
[1:17:23] first but both Israel and the
[1:17:27] Gentile amen were
[1:17:32] disass they
[1:17:36] were amen the
[1:17:43] Jews and they went into all the nations
[1:17:48] around they were scattered all over the
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:52] place and for us we were
[1:17:55] scattered from the word into
[1:18:00] denomination and what people call the
[1:18:05] word is just
[1:18:09] denominationalism if you make a good
[1:18:12] one if you get a philosophical
[1:18:16] one you can really get a good
[1:18:20] harest and the people will say we in the
[1:18:23] world which is very good amen but we
[1:18:27] have to be
[1:18:29] gathered into the
[1:18:31] word amen Israel needed to come back to
[1:18:34] their
[1:18:36] Homeland as we also needed to come back
[1:18:39] to the homeland of the
[1:18:42] world and all this happens in the same
[1:18:48] season are you together with me yes sir
[1:18:52] now let me tell you something
[1:18:55] God has revealed to us about what this
[1:18:59] is It's the revelation of
[1:19:02] Christ and the life of Christ in the
[1:19:06] people amen so by knowing what they
[1:19:10] are we hear the voice of the master
[1:19:15] calling us back to the
[1:19:18] Homeland so there was a season of
[1:19:21] time between the sixth and S
[1:19:28] hallelujah hallelujah amen that God
[1:19:31] began to call
[1:19:34] back Israel into their
[1:19:37] Homeland because that's their Promised
[1:19:41] Land God doesn't do anything
[1:19:44] much for Israel as a
[1:19:47] nation as long as they disass from their
[1:19:51] land when Abram was in the land
[1:19:55] he could defeat several
[1:19:58] kids when Israel went beyond the
[1:20:02] borders AB went beyond the
[1:20:05] Border he could be scared of one
[1:20:08] king amen but when they come back into
[1:20:11] their borders they are powerful no
[1:20:15] Nation can defeat them
[1:20:17] there right from the time when they
[1:20:20] became a
[1:20:21] nation they have never lost a war to
[1:20:23] anybody
[1:20:26] amen because they in their Homeland and
[1:20:29] I want tell you also that at the same
[1:20:33] season God has called us
[1:20:36] back into the homeland of the world and
[1:20:40] as long as we in the home we are not
[1:20:43] going to lose
[1:20:45] anyone amen because we've been given the
[1:20:49] weapons better than the atomic weapons
[1:20:53] we've been given the power of prayer
[1:20:56] we've been given the name of Jesus we've
[1:20:59] been given the character of
[1:21:01] desperation that we can always be able
[1:21:05] to call God to the
[1:21:08] SE
[1:21:09] amen yes sir the prophet says between
[1:21:13] the sixth and the seventh
[1:21:16] seal there was a calling out of the
[1:21:22] 144,000 amen then he said
[1:21:25] lukee
[1:21:29] 17 Hebrews
[1:21:31] 4:12 all the
[1:21:33] scriptures that were promised this is to
[1:21:37] be between the sixth and seventh
[1:21:40] SE and this is where we are
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:46] now are you together with me so as
[1:21:51] Israel is standing strong
[1:21:55] in her Nation winning all the
[1:21:58] battles so shall the restored
[1:22:02] bride back into the homeland of the
[1:22:05] world win every
[1:22:07] battle amen it doesn't say you are not
[1:22:10] going to fight
[1:22:12] Wars you are going to fight but you are
[1:22:15] going to
[1:22:17] win hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't
[1:22:20] mean you are not going to be
[1:22:23] persecuted pers but you not be
[1:22:27] defeated this is the season where God
[1:22:31] promised to stand on
[1:22:34] the
[1:22:36] amen okay
[1:22:39] so
[1:22:44] now we are in the perfect
[1:22:47] Faith the faith of Jesus
[1:22:50] Christ is the believer
[1:22:54] are you together with me do you remember
[1:22:57] your
[1:22:59] faith which is your human
[1:23:02] faith cannot save
[1:23:04] you that's what Ephesians 2
[1:23:09] says Amen Let Me Take You There for
[1:23:13] anybody who was not
[1:23:15] around Ephesians
[1:23:18] 28 the scripture tells us by grace are
[1:23:23] you saved through faith
[1:23:27] and that not of
[1:23:30] yourselves this Faith here is not your
[1:23:34] faith but it's the gift of God given to
[1:23:39] you are you together with me it's God's
[1:23:43] gift for you to be
[1:23:46] saved somebody say
[1:23:48] am okay I just want to let you
[1:23:52] know that the Faith of Christ
[1:23:55] Christ in you is the
[1:24:00] believer you cannot even
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:04] hold when that shifts a little
[1:24:08] biter had a human
[1:24:12] faith and real strong
[1:24:17] result or desire to do certain
[1:24:22] things he sees the stor
[1:24:25] I mean he is the Lord
[1:24:27] coming and then he says
[1:24:30] master I want to walk to
[1:24:33] you I don't know how far he
[1:24:36] was from the boat and the master be
[1:24:41] come and then he began to
[1:24:44] walk but the master
[1:24:46] himself knows how to prove that is not
[1:24:51] ourselves but it is him allowed the
[1:24:55] storm to
[1:24:56] come and when the storm came the faith
[1:25:00] of
[1:25:01] Peter was diminishing in the face of his
[1:25:06] stor and he was sinking but the faith of
[1:25:10] Jesus the gift of God extended the hand
[1:25:15] and he was able to walk on the
[1:25:17] water amen by the gift of
[1:25:21] faith which is the faith of the Lord
[1:25:23] Jesus Christ
[1:25:26] and now it's the same
[1:25:28] Faith which has saved you he doesn't
[1:25:31] save you today to lose you tomorrow I'm
[1:25:35] not saying you will not make mistakes in
[1:25:39] life but because it's the Faith of
[1:25:42] Christ prayed for you so that your faith
[1:25:47] fails
[1:25:49] not amen and so by this faith we
[1:25:53] continue our Pilgrim
[1:25:56] Journey amen through this
[1:25:59] situation but we overcome through the
[1:26:02] waters but we overcome through the
[1:26:05] floods we overcome up the hills we still
[1:26:09] overcome it's not I but Christ in me the
[1:26:15] hope of
[1:26:16] glory
[1:26:18] amen yes sir yes sir so we now enjoy the
[1:26:23] perfect
[1:26:27] we are in the age of the token
[1:26:31] himself the fullness of the goded
[1:26:34] body this time living in the
[1:26:38] church as the pass of the
[1:26:41] Holy amen so true light has come our
[1:26:46] way we now have a true
[1:26:49] understanding of God we have taken our
[1:26:53] baptism
[1:26:55] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:26:58] are being restored back to the apostolic
[1:27:02] faith and we know where we are on this
[1:27:06] journey because the
[1:27:08] trees are
[1:27:14] also not only
[1:27:17] Jerusalem but even out here in the
[1:27:19] Gentile there is the Life of Christ
[1:27:24] that's
[1:27:25] growing to come to The
[1:27:28] Headstone just like the Jews are growing
[1:27:32] in their face to up with Christ in this
[1:27:36] coming amen so St Luke
[1:27:42] 2129 where he says he spoke unto them a
[1:27:46] parable behold the Fig Tree and all the
[1:27:51] trees amen then he says here
[1:27:55] message
[1:27:56] rest when you see the Fig
[1:28:00] Tree putting forth the
[1:28:02] B and all the other
[1:28:05] trees not the time is
[1:28:07] near speaking of the second coming of
[1:28:12] Christ hallelujah hallelujah all the
[1:28:22] sides now What Remain
[1:28:25] is the coming of
[1:28:28] him
[1:28:30] amen Through the
[1:28:32] Ages it was either fig
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:36] tree then he would not care all the
[1:28:40] trees and then
[1:28:42] sometimes it would be all
[1:28:45] trees he wouldn't care all this fig
[1:28:49] tree but this time the Fig Tree and all
[1:28:53] tree
[1:28:55] meaning we are coming to the end of
[1:29:00] time would never with the Jews and
[1:29:02] Gentiles
[1:29:06] together amen praise the Lord but now
[1:29:11] that's what he's
[1:29:13] doing has a
[1:29:15] testim he says Israel became a
[1:29:19] na in
[1:29:21] 1947 on the same night the angel of the
[1:29:25] Lord came to him in a
[1:29:28] cave are you together with me now here
[1:29:31] is Israel becoming a nation and he is
[1:29:36] now the law raising up a man to go
[1:29:39] through all the trees to bring a Revival
[1:29:43] among the
[1:29:46] people amen and he says when you see
[1:29:49] them come together like
[1:29:52] that then time
[1:29:54] shall be no more hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:58] calling
[1:29:59] Israel into the
[1:30:01] Homeland and then the Gentiles to the
[1:30:05] Homeland for the opening of the
[1:30:08] world Amen listen now oh praise the Lord
[1:30:13] I told you one thing that if
[1:30:16] you are not
[1:30:20] prophetic in your understanding you
[1:30:24] cannot have
[1:30:25] fellowship with a prophet because the
[1:30:29] prophet draws his
[1:30:32] understanding from a supernatural
[1:30:35] Dimension sometimes it SE
[1:30:38] things that you may not be able to
[1:30:41] see but then you need the
[1:30:44] grace of
[1:30:45] Revelation upon your heart to fellowship
[1:30:49] with the prophet
[1:30:54] I told you the things they
[1:30:58] spoke a virgin shall
[1:31:01] conceive that had never been
[1:31:04] before people isolated
[1:31:07] Isaiah how can that be science
[1:31:11] alone
[1:31:13] science does not support that
[1:31:17] theory but it's a Divine
[1:31:20] Theory while they were still complaining
[1:31:24] Isaiah went her face
[1:31:27] higher and he
[1:31:29] says a son is
[1:31:31] born but Isaiah could not confirm it but
[1:31:35] the eyes of a prophet were looking at a
[1:31:38] son that's how difficult it is to have
[1:31:42] fellowship with the prophet unless you
[1:31:45] are in the same Dimension and praying
[1:31:48] father give me the grace to see what he
[1:31:51] see one time when Syria were trying to
[1:31:56] wage a
[1:31:58] war amen against Israel there was a
[1:32:02] prophet in the land who tell the king of
[1:32:05] is what Syria wanted to do and so now
[1:32:09] it's time Syria moved their
[1:32:13] forces to come and attack they landed in
[1:32:17] Ambush amen and they were beaten and the
[1:32:21] King said all of us
[1:32:25] on this military
[1:32:27] ccil amen who of
[1:32:31] you of
[1:32:33] Israel and then one of them said none of
[1:32:37] us so
[1:32:38] General but I want to tell you in Israel
[1:32:43] there is a man he called a prophet his
[1:32:46] name is Elijah has the ability to see
[1:32:50] what you think of theer of
[1:32:54] of the
[1:32:55] mind when he's not here he knows what we
[1:32:58] are
[1:33:01] doing and now the foolishness of the
[1:33:05] lack of
[1:33:10] Christ the King said we go and get that
[1:33:14] one
[1:33:17] first he's a military
[1:33:21] strategist so he knows how now to defeat
[1:33:24] the
[1:33:26] war our first
[1:33:28] Target is that Prophet then he sent some
[1:33:33] people to spy out the
[1:33:36] prophet they found him
[1:33:38] staying in some mountain
[1:33:42] ranges you know he was a prophet and
[1:33:45] Prophets are
[1:33:46] eagles and they love
[1:33:48] mountains amen they want those I mean
[1:33:52] areas
[1:33:54] which is not very
[1:33:55] crowded where they can go in and
[1:33:58] pray so then the man dispatches his
[1:34:02] Army and went and they
[1:34:05] surrounded so the servant of the
[1:34:09] Prophet wakes up very early in the
[1:34:12] morning to prepare the day for
[1:34:16] the amen and as he opened the
[1:34:19] door he saw the ambushment
[1:34:25] amen and all the horses and
[1:34:29] [Music]
[1:34:33] Horsemen you know
[1:34:35] Shields he locked the door and came to
[1:34:39] the
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:46] king the people have surrounded
[1:34:49] us the prophet was very calm
[1:34:55] sometimes God will allow situations in
[1:34:58] our
[1:34:58] Liv but the only way you can
[1:35:02] overcome is learn to
[1:35:06] be if you are not come you make a lot of
[1:35:10] mistakes in your
[1:35:12] life Lear to
[1:35:15] become storms will gather
[1:35:18] around but Lear to
[1:35:20] be the prophet has come he went into
[1:35:24] prayer and he says Lord open the young
[1:35:28] man's
[1:35:30] eyes and when he opened the door
[1:35:33] again he came again
[1:35:38] Shou army of the
[1:35:41] Lord those were nothing now so you know
[1:35:45] the I mean the prophet was seeing
[1:35:49] through a
[1:35:50] dimension but this man here
[1:35:55] can
[1:35:56] be it's not very easy to fellow the
[1:36:02] prophet if you cannot have the ability
[1:36:05] to look into
[1:36:08] Channel amen so brother Bram says
[1:36:12] this this seven sealed
[1:36:17] book is revealed at the time of the
[1:36:20] seven thunders of Revelation 10
[1:36:25] I saw another Mighty
[1:36:28] Angel come down from heaven closed with
[1:36:31] a
[1:36:32] CL and upon
[1:36:36] his if you not that's
[1:36:40] Christ in the Old
[1:36:42] Testament was called the end of the
[1:36:45] Covenant is directly coming to the Jews
[1:36:50] now for the church is finished
[1:36:55] hallelujah
[1:36:57] hallelujah he says the church is
[1:37:00] finished yes because the
[1:37:04] church finishes
[1:37:07] at but that's not the end of the
[1:37:11] people he goes beyond the
[1:37:14] church into the
[1:37:16] bridge and says come up
[1:37:19] here hallelujah hallelujah and those of
[1:37:22] you
[1:37:24] who came out you are not
[1:37:27] inia you are now in the
[1:37:30] prach Hallelujah and it's in this
[1:37:33] prach where the Fig Tree and all the
[1:37:38] trees being dealt
[1:37:42] with are you together with me so at this
[1:37:46] coming when Christ comes in Revelation
[1:37:51] 101 amen holding an open
[1:37:55] book Hallelujah he coming
[1:37:59] directly to the Jews but how possible is
[1:38:03] it for him to get the
[1:38:06] Jews without passing through the
[1:38:11] gentil i t that
[1:38:14] sometime but I want to bring it back
[1:38:17] here because we are
[1:38:19] dealing with the Fig Tree and all tree
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:25] together now God is working among the
[1:38:29] Gentiles is working among the
[1:38:33] Jews he preparing our going out as he
[1:38:37] preparing their coming
[1:38:40] in amen so
[1:38:44] yes his threee was coming direct to the
[1:38:48] Jews but the
[1:38:50] Gentiles are his Junction point
[1:38:57] amen because the working of
[1:39:00] God he does nothing without a
[1:39:05] body he needed a
[1:39:07] body he could do
[1:39:09] nothing until he the Jesus
[1:39:12] body and now he can do nothing until he
[1:39:17] has the body of the
[1:39:19] church where his hands where his hand
[1:39:24] we are his leg we are his
[1:39:28] embodiment amen and works through
[1:39:34] us are you together with me so how could
[1:39:39] we have got the
[1:39:41] gospel if he was not
[1:39:44] embodied a man of the the Jewish
[1:39:50] men the
[1:39:51] apostles amen
[1:39:54] who came and brought the
[1:39:55] gospel and the Jews rejected it then we
[1:39:59] took it are you together with me how can
[1:40:03] the Jews take
[1:40:05] it unless we have
[1:40:08] received and then
[1:40:11] rejected so he has to
[1:40:14] come into Revelation when he
[1:40:17] came amen way back as Jesus of Nazareth
[1:40:24] he came to the Jews and the Jews
[1:40:27] rejected the
[1:40:29] atonement and the atonement came to us
[1:40:33] amen and now he's coming back as the
[1:40:38] revelation of that Christ in his own
[1:40:42] word until you reject
[1:40:45] it the Jews
[1:40:51] will let me say
[1:40:55] something
[1:41:00] amen needed to take
[1:41:04] Ruth for his
[1:41:06] wife but there was no way he could take
[1:41:10] her he had to redeem Naomi
[1:41:15] first and then have all that which was
[1:41:21] Naomi including r
[1:41:24] that's the only way he could redeem her
[1:41:28] so by redeeming Nomi to
[1:41:32] himself boas could have
[1:41:34] Ruth and that's how Ruth becomes that
[1:41:38] beautiful
[1:41:40] story of the Gentile
[1:41:42] bride she had been grafted
[1:41:47] into Naomi was the means by which she
[1:41:51] could be redeemed
[1:41:55] amen and now when she was
[1:41:58] redeemed and became wife to
[1:42:02] B then
[1:42:05] came was born then out of bed came
[1:42:11] Jess out of Jess came
[1:42:14] David out of David came
[1:42:16] Solomon and all the way to the coming of
[1:42:21] Christ are you together with me so
[1:42:24] Israel gave to us the
[1:42:27] gospel by rejecting it and as the
[1:42:31] Gentiles when we reject it the Jews are
[1:42:35] now ready to
[1:42:37] take they are
[1:42:41] desperate they want the Messiah to come
[1:42:46] back now every day they live upon the
[1:42:50] promises
[1:42:53] say This Is Our Land This is the land
[1:42:58] where Jeremiah and Isiah
[1:43:02] preached this is the
[1:43:04] country where David
[1:43:07] ruled this is the country where Jesus
[1:43:13] live they are coming
[1:43:16] closer they have got
[1:43:19] something that's saying it is homegoing
[1:43:22] time
[1:43:25] now if God is dealing with
[1:43:29] us in the unique way this
[1:43:32] season there must be a similar
[1:43:37] desire the
[1:43:38] genti that we want to go
[1:43:45] home God has never any time being
[1:43:48] without
[1:43:50] witness he kept the Gentile
[1:43:55] until he could get the Gentile
[1:44:00] Church Amen brother Bram
[1:44:05] says
[1:44:07] here that at the coming in Revelation
[1:44:12] 10 he's coming directly to the
[1:44:18] Jews understand this so and The
[1:44:22] Testament right I mean the statement
[1:44:25] right
[1:44:29] here makes us very worried or prepared
[1:44:36] rather we say Lord we want to be
[1:44:39] ready we want to go
[1:44:42] home we prepare
[1:44:44] ourselves because he coming
[1:44:47] directly but he couldn't
[1:44:50] bypass because works by your body
[1:44:57] that's the way God
[1:44:58] works amen so let's get a little
[1:45:03] bit into the deeper waters if we
[1:45:07] can amen this is now getting a little
[1:45:11] deeper
[1:45:13] here that the same day Israel became a
[1:45:19] nation the
[1:45:21] angel of the
[1:45:24] came
[1:45:26] down and spoke to brother
[1:45:29] Bram about the restoration of the
[1:45:34] church you should read the sture I
[1:45:37] mean uh you should read the message
[1:45:40] Feast of
[1:45:45] trumpets therefore the genti
[1:45:48] bride must
[1:45:51] receive the fullness of her
[1:45:55] Redemption and be sealed
[1:45:59] in he wants to do the best he
[1:46:04] can he's
[1:46:06] doing giving us all the
[1:46:10] word he's allowing
[1:46:13] situations
[1:46:16] circumstances
[1:46:18] trials to awaken the Gentile
[1:46:24] so that we cannot
[1:46:26] Slumber because the coming of the
[1:46:29] Lord is very near so
[1:46:33] God God s a message to the
[1:46:37] edge but in the
[1:46:40] age it looks like there are
[1:46:44] layers layers to that
[1:46:50] message let me like a dealing with this
[1:46:55] book there is a message here then that
[1:46:59] layer is
[1:47:00] gone there is a message here then the
[1:47:04] layer is gone then there is a page here
[1:47:08] then that layer is gone you understand
[1:47:11] now so that's the way God is working
[1:47:13] with
[1:47:14] us that he has brought to
[1:47:17] us a message but under that message
[1:47:23] they are
[1:47:24] layers which bring
[1:47:27] Revival to different
[1:47:30] Generations in
[1:47:34] the are you together with me now we you
[1:47:38] know so far we are almost 120
[1:47:45] years since the age
[1:47:48] opened are you together with me we are
[1:47:51] almost 100 20
[1:47:54] years which is speaking about now three
[1:48:02] generations but now there has been
[1:48:04] something in every
[1:48:07] generation that keeps driving the church
[1:48:12] forward Amen in
[1:48:16] 1906 the beginning of the
[1:48:19] church we had Simons here the man who
[1:48:23] was in ausa
[1:48:25] Street and he was praying the Holy
[1:48:29] Spirit came down and they started a
[1:48:32] Revival in that
[1:48:34] generation and that drove the
[1:48:37] church the gifts of the Holy Ghost and
[1:48:41] the Pentecostal
[1:48:43] movement became so
[1:48:45] powerful it was a space of
[1:48:49] time in the age so in the
[1:48:53] age there are several
[1:48:57] Generations but every
[1:48:59] generation must
[1:49:01] find sound Revival of the message given
[1:49:06] to the
[1:49:08] Earth are you together with me yes sir
[1:49:12] when one layer is fing off in the
[1:49:17] generation another layer of the same
[1:49:21] message open
[1:49:23] and again it finds
[1:49:27] another are you together with me one
[1:49:30] begins with
[1:49:33] justification amen opens up the person's
[1:49:37] heart amen as a flame of fire comes in
[1:49:41] there and then
[1:49:46] weep at the altar at the power of
[1:49:49] justification
[1:49:52] they see the Heaven's Door
[1:49:55] open when they leave the
[1:49:58] altar they happen because they've seen
[1:50:00] the Lord Jesus
[1:50:02] Christ but as the man seems to set
[1:50:07] down another lay again opens
[1:50:11] up a stronger fire
[1:50:15] ignites which is the need of
[1:50:19] sanctification not that justification is
[1:50:22] dead
[1:50:24] but just another
[1:50:26] layer adds to the
[1:50:29] justification and we call it
[1:50:32] sanctification something on the side of
[1:50:35] you conv you to live
[1:50:38] clean put some levels of
[1:50:43] sacrifice in your new
[1:50:45] work Lord I don't want to be like this I
[1:50:49] want don't want to be like that amen you
[1:50:52] are parting with different fashions in
[1:50:56] life you are cutting off and limiting
[1:51:00] and godly
[1:51:04] associations you are cutting of places
[1:51:07] you go
[1:51:08] to amen you are investing
[1:51:12] time into the study and
[1:51:15] prayer you are investing time in
[1:51:19] fellowship with the
[1:51:20] Brotherhood you are saying Lord Jesus
[1:51:23] Christ I pray that you may meet me have
[1:51:26] fellowship with me I don't want to be
[1:51:29] what I used to be that's another
[1:51:33] layer of
[1:51:35] Revival the Holy Spirit keeps opening up
[1:51:45] again comes the great
[1:51:48] experience the of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:52] in the chambers of
[1:51:55] Joy the confidence of
[1:51:58] God is always
[1:52:01] Revival after
[1:52:03] Revival this is how the
[1:52:05] ages kept
[1:52:07] moving just like you the
[1:52:11] individual amen when the Lord visited
[1:52:14] you he didn't visit you with all
[1:52:17] understanding he just placed one thing
[1:52:21] conviction against
[1:52:24] justification and then you thanked God
[1:52:27] and you went back home saying I thank
[1:52:30] God I'm not what I used to be I thank
[1:52:33] God I I've had the
[1:52:36] visitation of the Holy Ghost while you
[1:52:40] settle then the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:52:44] point to you certain things in your life
[1:52:48] that need to be settled then you settle
[1:52:51] one by one you are crying Heavenly
[1:52:55] Father help me never to go back in those
[1:52:59] things that how you pray you keep crying
[1:53:03] father w't you make me better than
[1:53:06] this help me to be in control of myself
[1:53:11] Soul you are dealing with
[1:53:14] sanctification then comes the BM of
[1:53:17] the and then the joy where you feel like
[1:53:21] something has burned
[1:53:24] some stuff out of
[1:53:26] you like there is a
[1:53:29] burden that has gone off of you and you
[1:53:32] are beginning to
[1:53:34] Rejoice the way God has been dealing
[1:53:37] with
[1:53:37] you is the way God deals with every
[1:53:43] Church text the church
[1:53:45] age from one layer into another layer so
[1:53:50] a generation
[1:53:52] as I said is 40
[1:53:54] years and going by the period this age
[1:53:58] started
[1:54:00] in
[1:54:02] 1906 to this we in the third
[1:54:06] generation so in the same age we've had
[1:54:10] theusa
[1:54:13] experience the outpouring of the Holy
[1:54:17] Gift the gifts of the holy spirit rather
[1:54:21] burning
[1:54:22] until God brought his Prophet to the
[1:54:31] Sea Malachi 4
[1:54:34] came and like all this never
[1:54:45] mattered like the other which came first
[1:54:48] were not anything anything of value
[1:54:53] but yet it
[1:54:54] was but it's a
[1:54:57] Revival a layer of
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:08] Revival and by
[1:55:11] 1956 theusa Revival
[1:55:16] Clos and brother bram's
[1:55:19] Ministry started trying and started the
[1:55:23] time the lose
[1:55:27] ends they began he began to put
[1:55:34] together the areas of the
[1:55:38] word which was not very
[1:55:41] understood he started
[1:55:44] preaching things
[1:55:47] different from what was meing
[1:55:52] not that they are not part of the
[1:55:55] word but not that they are not the major
[1:56:00] now amen he started preaching
[1:56:05] messages like the junction
[1:56:09] time seven
[1:56:11] Junctions he preached the
[1:56:14] Hebrews to help the people understand
[1:56:18] Redemption he preached the mark of the
[1:56:20] beast
[1:56:22] he came with handwriting on the
[1:56:25] wall all the way to the seven
[1:56:30] churches he preached the statue of a
[1:56:34] perfectas
[1:56:36] names and then towards the opening of
[1:56:38] the
[1:56:42] seals this the
[1:56:45] time the fullness of the
[1:56:49] message was going to come the seals were
[1:56:53] going to
[1:56:54] be say is this the time then
[1:57:00] finally boom into the world and here we
[1:57:05] came to know the purpose of
[1:57:08] God the opening of the seals the Jour of
[1:57:12] his
[1:57:13] coming amen from Genesis
[1:57:18] 35 all the
[1:57:20] way to the New
[1:57:23] Jerusalem we look at Christ in the word
[1:57:27] in the word in the word the Bible became
[1:57:30] a new
[1:57:31] Bible and when we picked the word and we
[1:57:35] fed on it it was a
[1:57:38] Revival the churches were
[1:57:41] established in the country but even in
[1:57:45] Uganda is coming to a
[1:57:47] jubilee since the message started out so
[1:57:51] what's my message
[1:57:53] today there must be another layer to
[1:57:58] this
[1:57:59] message in this
[1:58:03] country there must be another
[1:58:07] layer there must be some young
[1:58:11] people that should come
[1:58:13] forth dig into the
[1:58:16] world cry to
[1:58:18] God ask
[1:58:20] father what is the way forward for this
[1:58:25] message amen are you together with me
[1:58:30] hallelujah hallelujah listen to what
[1:58:32] brother Bram
[1:58:34] say no age ever comes
[1:58:41] back that's the principle
[1:58:45] Revival you cannot go and War on a past
[1:58:50] fire
[1:58:55] [Music]
[1:59:00] and you are sitting near the
[1:59:02] furnace but it is
[1:59:07] ashes do you hear what I say you cannot
[1:59:10] do that you need the fire in its
[1:59:17] present what is the visitation of God
[1:59:21] now
[1:59:25] how is
[1:59:27] God going to keep the fires of the
[1:59:33] word amen what's the next
[1:59:37] layer of this message it is not another
[1:59:43] message it's just another
[1:59:45] layer that's already in the
[1:59:50] message amen
[1:59:52] yeah it can't have like you know he says
[1:59:56] uh no Revival ever comes
[2:00:00] back it can't have the life of God in
[2:00:04] it by natural
[2:00:07] generation it takes a regeneration from
[2:00:12] above this last
[2:00:15] age started with the fire of Pentecostal
[2:00:18] Revival
[2:00:22] is right
[2:00:23] back and they became exactly like the
[2:00:27] Baptist you know methods and
[2:00:31] everything instead of taking the
[2:00:34] word they took their own
[2:00:37] ideas and did just what every age has
[2:00:42] done substituted the manual for the
[2:00:47] world just step outside of that manual
[2:00:54] and see what happens you are out
[2:00:58] brother and they will
[2:01:01] you and blame it
[2:01:08] on but when you meet the brother you
[2:01:10] can't
[2:01:12] even but you are blaming it on
[2:01:15] God God have
[2:01:17] mercy and how they they love the
[2:01:20] organization
[2:01:23] they are second generation
[2:01:26] Pentecostal and since
[2:01:29] God doesn't have
[2:01:32] grandchildren they are just
[2:01:37] children their
[2:01:39] fathers known by their
[2:01:41] Creed and form of
[2:01:44] worship they can look they can talk
[2:01:47] about what used to
[2:01:49] be but they can't produce it
[2:01:53] once they had
[2:01:57] lightning but now it's
[2:02:09] only praise the Lord he says what shall
[2:02:14] we
[2:02:16] do when you see a
[2:02:20] generation Gathering itself
[2:02:23] go back into the former Revival they
[2:02:28] came
[2:02:29] from it's a time for the people to
[2:02:36] awaken are you together with me when you
[2:02:40] see the people gather themselves up get
[2:02:44] back into the Pentecostal
[2:02:47] organ it's time to
[2:02:49] awaken there must come a Revival
[2:02:54] every generation must have its own
[2:03:01] Revival young
[2:03:03] men must the
[2:03:05] word must pray until
[2:03:09] something opens up to propel their
[2:03:13] generation
[2:03:18] forward are you together with me so
[2:03:21] there should
[2:03:23] be there should be a deep
[2:03:26] cry for Revival from the young
[2:03:30] people amen the layer
[2:03:34] today which is opening up
[2:03:37] now is Christ being revealed in his word
[2:03:43] in a more significant way than ever
[2:03:48] before that's what we want to see
[2:03:52] come to the edge of the
[2:03:54] cap so we are looking for the
[2:03:59] layer the true and faithful
[2:04:02] layer the layer
[2:04:04] today I want to call it the
[2:04:08] amen we have to come to the
[2:04:11] purpose the mark of the High
[2:04:14] Calling this is where we want to be
[2:04:18] that's the Revival we want to see rival
[2:04:22] that will build rapturing faith in the
[2:04:27] church amen so the message could never
[2:04:31] lead to anything less than
[2:04:36] Christ are you together with me praise
[2:04:39] the Lord because the ministry of the
[2:04:42] Prophet was to reveal
[2:04:45] Christ amen it's not the
[2:04:49] revelation of the ministry of the
[2:04:52] man so our
[2:04:54] study and our
[2:04:57] commitment is not the stud of the works
[2:05:00] of a great
[2:05:02] man it is through his
[2:05:05] works let us see the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:09] that's where the Revival will start
[2:05:12] from when the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:05:16] Christ is being so emminent Among Us
[2:05:23] amen praise the Lord the layer
[2:05:27] today is the truth of the person of the
[2:05:32] Lord Jesus Christ Living Among
[2:05:38] Us you see what I mean there must be a
[2:05:48] cry because here we are
[2:05:52] you know we are winding up the fourth
[2:05:55] generation in the
[2:05:58] age but every
[2:06:02] generation must
[2:06:04] have its own
[2:06:07] Revival what's going to bring the
[2:06:10] Revival Among Us in this
[2:06:15] time Christ stepping forth as
[2:06:20] revelation Among
[2:06:24] Us that's what we are looking
[2:06:26] for father reveal your
[2:06:30] son in
[2:06:34] me
[2:06:37] listen a moment consideration of church
[2:06:48] history will prove how accurate
[2:06:53] this thought
[2:06:54] is in the Dark
[2:06:57] Ages the word was almost entirely lost
[2:07:01] from the
[2:07:03] people and God sent Luther with the
[2:07:07] world and spoke for
[2:07:11] God at that time but they
[2:07:15] organized and again pure word was
[2:07:19] lost organization tends towards
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:26] dog are not simple
[2:07:29] word they could no longer speak for
[2:07:33] God then God sent
[2:07:36] Wesley and he was the voice with the
[2:07:38] word in his
[2:07:40] day the people who took his Revelation
[2:07:43] from
[2:07:46] God the living
[2:07:49] Epistles read and know of all
[2:07:52] men for their
[2:07:54] generation when the Methodist
[2:07:57] failed God raised up
[2:08:00] others and so it has gone on through the
[2:08:05] years until this last day there is
[2:08:10] again another people in the
[2:08:12] land who under their
[2:08:15] Messenger will be the final
[2:08:18] voice to the final end
[2:08:23] will you be that final
[2:08:26] voice to the final
[2:08:29] ede amen let me say a few things here
[2:08:32] before I
[2:08:33] close Daniel was to by the books
[2:08:36] understood by the
[2:08:38] books and he set himself
[2:08:41] ready for the return to
[2:08:44] Jerusalem when he was out in
[2:08:48] Babylon amen he studed the word
[2:08:52] and he came to a point we shall be 70
[2:08:56] years in captivity in
[2:09:00] babyon it is 70
[2:09:03] years talk about the
[2:09:06] Revival and Daniel began to
[2:09:09] pray and to
[2:09:11] search and the angel came
[2:09:14] down SP
[2:09:17] Revival are you together with me amen
[2:09:22] so here we are
[2:09:24] friends Daniel did not get stuck in
[2:09:27] knowledge
[2:09:29] areas he applied the
[2:09:32] knowledge to open it the next
[2:09:37] layer of
[2:09:40] Revival so he came down and told the
[2:09:44] people s are over oh
[2:09:49] Hallelujah are over
[2:09:52] and all Israel that was in Babylon began
[2:09:56] to sing 70 years is over they started
[2:10:00] lifting up their hands they were singing
[2:10:02] songs of Jubilee their eyes were off the
[2:10:06] Captivity and they were looking back to
[2:10:09] Jerusalem they looking at the
[2:10:11] restoration of the
[2:10:12] temple Hallelujah they are must be
[2:10:16] something open up another
[2:10:19] generation we Maring into the fourth
[2:10:23] generation in this age there must be
[2:10:27] something that should Spar a
[2:10:31] Revival amen we ought to understand by
[2:10:35] books and use the knowledge of the
[2:10:38] message to Break Forth into another
[2:10:43] layer the word must bring us to the
[2:10:47] person of the word hallelujah
[2:10:51] the world must bring us to the person of
[2:10:56] the world because the prophet says my
[2:11:01] Ministry is declare that is here
[2:11:05] hallelujah hallelujah and we see him in
[2:11:08] our homes in our lives in whatever we do
[2:11:14] friends this is the season we are living
[2:11:17] in where we can say here he is
[2:11:21] and looking Upon
[2:11:23] Jesus amen that's what you know John is
[2:11:28] saying John the Baptist
[2:11:30] said the Lamb of
[2:11:33] God and then as he said like that he was
[2:11:37] the
[2:11:38] prophet was
[2:11:40] introducing Christ the word to his
[2:11:45] disciples are you together with me and
[2:11:47] the two
[2:11:49] disciples heard him speak
[2:11:52] and they left
[2:11:54] John and they went to Jesus are you
[2:11:57] together with
[2:11:59] me we have
[2:12:03] stayed just enjoying
[2:12:06] Fellowship we teaching what brother Bram
[2:12:09] has given to
[2:12:11] us but as we stud the
[2:12:14] message
[2:12:16] prayerfully there will be a voice Behold
[2:12:19] the Lamb of God
[2:12:22] that day you get a revelation of what
[2:12:25] made you
[2:12:26] believe it was to come to the person of
[2:12:31] the Lord Jesus
[2:12:32] Christ amen then Jesus
[2:12:36] stand and saw the two
[2:12:38] following and said unto them what seek
[2:12:42] ye and they said unto him
[2:12:46] Rabbi which is to interpret
[2:12:48] Master where dwellest thou
[2:12:52] he says to
[2:12:54] them come and see hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:58] praise God it was good they followed I
[2:13:02] mean joh the
[2:13:04] Baptist but if they
[2:13:06] failed to see the person of the Lord
[2:13:10] Jesus Christ the minister of John has
[2:13:17] failed do you see where the next Revival
[2:13:19] is
[2:13:21] is
[2:13:22] you Faithfully under the Min of Malachi
[2:13:27] 4 you must come to a
[2:13:29] point where you can say
[2:13:33] master where dwell thou and then you
[2:13:37] follow him to a greater revelation of
[2:13:40] who he
[2:13:42] is
[2:13:44] amen the word spoken by the
[2:13:48] prophet LED them into fellow
[2:13:53] amen so this is the hour of moving into
[2:13:59] Fellowship the word in our individual
[2:14:02] capacity we are not Believers because we
[2:14:05] come to church we are believers because
[2:14:09] we want to see where he dwelleth and
[2:14:13] have fellowship with
[2:14:18] him and then he'll say come and see we
[2:14:22] want to come into fellowship with the
[2:14:26] person of the word amen so we thank God
[2:14:30] for the
[2:14:31] prophet and his message but the message
[2:14:36] in there lays another
[2:14:39] layer we must open the
[2:14:42] layer of divine
[2:14:45] Fellowship
[2:14:48] Christ amen because you see through the
[2:14:51] seven
[2:14:53] churches it was pulling people into
[2:14:57] fellowship with
[2:14:58] Christ hallelujah hallelujah if we don't
[2:15:01] see Christ The Messengers become a
[2:15:04] curtain if we don't see Christ the
[2:15:07] ministry of the messenger has failed I
[2:15:11] want every one of us to have a personal
[2:15:15] revelation and the testimony of seeing
[2:15:18] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:15:22] amen that's the next Revival where
[2:15:26] people have a testimony that God
[2:15:29] transforming
[2:15:30] powering on side of me throughout the
[2:15:34] seven Church
[2:15:35] ages the
[2:15:39] timate I am
[2:15:41] here I am here I am here not to hear
[2:15:46] about
[2:15:47] him amen and when I saw him
[2:15:51] John says I fell at his
[2:15:55] feet and he say and he laid his hand
[2:15:58] upon me and said unto me fear not I am
[2:16:04] the
[2:16:05] first and the last I am here I'm not
[2:16:09] here to intimidate you with my presence
[2:16:14] I am here to introduce you to a greater
[2:16:18] Revival to a realization
[2:16:22] who I am and want to bring
[2:16:28] you amen and then he tells John I am he
[2:16:33] that
[2:16:34] live oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[2:16:38] I am he which searches the
[2:16:41] RS so we need to come to the I am
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:48] he that was the ultimate
[2:16:53] never from I
[2:16:56] am the transforming
[2:17:00] message which way to the
[2:17:02] edges until we come into the
[2:17:06] [Applause]
[2:17:07] presence we only be church
[2:17:13] members God bless
[2:17:18] you we need to come
[2:17:21] into
[2:17:23] fellowship with I am
[2:17:26] he so beyond the baptism of the Holy
[2:17:30] Ghost Peter breaks into another
[2:17:35] layer fellowship with the person of the
[2:17:37] Lord Jesus
[2:17:39] Christ when he was in
[2:17:42] prison he was
[2:17:44] bound but the person that filled him
[2:17:49] came forward and released
[2:17:53] him
[2:17:54] amen you see it's going
[2:17:58] Beyond to testify I have the B of
[2:18:02] the it must come to a
[2:18:05] moment where we say we have got
[2:18:10] fellowship with the
[2:18:12] guide that he comes to me when I'm in
[2:18:16] prison he comes to me when I'm in
[2:18:19] hospital it comes to me when I am in
[2:18:23] deaths it comes to me when I'm in misery
[2:18:27] he comes to me when I am in fear oh
[2:18:32] Hallelujah he that is in you must also
[2:18:36] come back and fellowship with
[2:18:42] you this goes beyond the anointing
[2:18:47] now into Fellowship
[2:18:50] next
[2:18:52] level of Revival that we are
[2:18:54] look is not knowing the godhead
[2:18:58] alone not knowing the
[2:19:00] baptism coming to a
[2:19:03] fellowship to a
[2:19:05] union with the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:11] Christ somebody amen
[2:19:14] there the prophet says
[2:19:18] justification is what you believe
[2:19:22] sanctification is what the blood did for
[2:19:25] you you are Sanctified by
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:28] believing but when you are filled with
[2:19:31] the Holy
[2:19:32] Ghost it's the person of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:38] himself the person of the Holy
[2:19:41] Ghost not
[2:19:43] imaginations not some kind of
[2:19:46] psychology the person of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:51] that's the next
[2:19:53] Revival to bring him from the
[2:19:57] Mind reality of his
[2:20:01] presence that becomes a
[2:20:06] companion in times of
[2:20:09] trouble when you are going out into
[2:20:12] party he's there with you when they are
[2:20:15] pulling you to
[2:20:17] prison for whatever reason like they did
[2:20:21] Peter he was there with him when they
[2:20:24] two came into the
[2:20:26] fire amen he was there with the HEB
[2:20:30] children when they him into the
[2:20:33] land what does that mean that at this
[2:20:37] point the
[2:20:39] Revival is more of
[2:20:44] Christ than we have ever than we have
[2:20:47] ever known
[2:20:49] before because
[2:20:51] he has to become moral to
[2:20:54] us as we keep getting closer to the
[2:20:57] coming
[2:20:59] of are you together with me Christ in
[2:21:04] the person of the Holy
[2:21:05] Ghost comes upon you in the true btis of
[2:21:09] the Holy Ghost and you got all these
[2:21:13] virtues then God lives in a
[2:21:17] tabernacle the building
[2:21:20] living Tabernacle of the
[2:21:22] living God's
[2:21:25] Place Nazareth Jesus of
[2:21:28] Nazareth the Holy Ghost is here in the
[2:21:32] person of the Holy Ghost when was the
[2:21:36] life that was in him which was the life
[2:21:39] which was in
[2:21:40] him he's here working through
[2:21:44] people and declaring
[2:21:47] himself by signs and wonders
[2:21:51] which he
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:55] does he's becoming more
[2:22:03] real being more closer to us than ever
[2:22:09] before that's the Revival that we are
[2:22:11] talking
[2:22:13] about the Revival where they not tell
[2:22:16] you let's go to
[2:22:19] church but the
[2:22:21] guide we always
[2:22:23] turn and then you'll say yes Lord and
[2:22:27] then he guides you
[2:22:30] to there must be
[2:22:33] something take
[2:22:36] control of Our
[2:22:40] Lives praise the Lord he says today he's
[2:22:45] standing Among Us in the person of the
[2:22:48] Holy Ghost manifesting himself
[2:22:53] more coming into his church making
[2:22:56] himself known because him and the bride
[2:23:01] and the groom will be the same thing
[2:23:04] making himself known and one day you see
[2:23:09] that the one that you f in your
[2:23:13] heart and see his
[2:23:16] identification will become personalized
[2:23:19] before you
[2:23:21] then you and he will become one that's
[2:23:26] the
[2:23:27] Revival to come into that
[2:23:30] image it's not saying I have a
[2:23:33] message but it is saying the Lord has
[2:23:37] made me the message of the
[2:23:40] hour amen will that come to be our
[2:23:46] testimony amen he says you can't do it
[2:23:49] now
[2:23:51] you can't satisfy that
[2:23:54] hly amen except by God himself
[2:24:00] living amen hallelujah hallelujah the
[2:24:03] word must bring us into Divine
[2:24:06] fellowship with the person himself this
[2:24:10] is the Revival that we are looking at we
[2:24:14] must be
[2:24:15] facing into him I in you you in me much
[2:24:22] as we are under the ministry of brother
[2:24:25] BR the success of that
[2:24:28] Ministry amen is when you have
[2:24:31] found the reality of the Lord Jesus
[2:24:36] Christ person to
[2:24:38] you amen we are just a step
[2:24:42] away to the perfect
[2:24:46] realization so what is happening now the
[2:24:49] next r
[2:24:52] is the image of
[2:24:53] Christ getting closer and closer and
[2:25:00] closer and him becomes one comes the
[2:25:07] Rapture that's the
[2:25:09] Revival God help me to be you oh
[2:25:14] Heavenly Father be me that I may be you
[2:25:19] that's the next Revival
[2:25:21] it's not just a matter of coming to
[2:25:24] church it's not playing tapes and living
[2:25:28] that to that but is playing that tip and
[2:25:32] asking the life of God the anointing
[2:25:35] upon that to come and take over our
[2:25:40] lives amen he says the things says he
[2:25:45] that is
[2:25:47] true oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:25:51] it's not knowing about
[2:25:53] him it's not is knowing
[2:25:57] him not knowing about
[2:25:59] him but knowing
[2:26:02] him now knowing
[2:26:05] about could be reading through the
[2:26:09] message the testimony of your
[2:26:12] pastor the testimony of your
[2:26:14] brother but knowing
[2:26:17] him is that relationship
[2:26:21] I think you pick that out of the
[2:26:25] [Music]
[2:26:29] exhortation
[2:26:31] okay praise the
[2:26:34] Lord you see that's what I'm trying to
[2:26:37] talk
[2:26:38] about he says these things says he
[2:26:43] that and listen to the
[2:26:46] word now this word true is a very
[2:26:51] wonderful
[2:26:53] word it's not to mean
[2:26:57] true just in the sense that is opposite
[2:27:00] of
[2:27:06] false amen it expresses perfect
[2:27:11] realization of an
[2:27:16] idea as contrasted with paral
[2:27:19] realization
[2:27:23] amen so for you to
[2:27:26] understand him that is
[2:27:30] true you need to
[2:27:32] see back in the Old
[2:27:35] Testament where you know he gave them
[2:27:39] bread from
[2:27:42] heaven and they ate the bread from
[2:27:46] heaven but that was not the true bread
[2:27:50] that bread was speaking of the coming of
[2:27:54] the
[2:27:55] bread when Jesus came said I am the true
[2:28:00] bread so the word
[2:28:03] true in this sense is so
[2:28:08] great that it takes away the
[2:28:11] shadows and brings forth before
[2:28:14] us the perfect
[2:28:17] realization of the person that was was
[2:28:20] hiding before the behind the
[2:28:24] shadow when John said Behold the Lamb of
[2:28:30] God that was the true
[2:28:34] lamb to the
[2:28:37] lamb were given in the
[2:28:40] sacrifice so right now in the time he
[2:28:46] says I am
[2:28:47] he that is true amen what does that mean
[2:28:53] that Christ has come before us are we
[2:28:57] going to take the benefit of his
[2:29:01] presence that's the next
[2:29:04] Revival to seek Christ and take him as
[2:29:09] person and take
[2:29:12] everything that he has the ability to
[2:29:16] give we are pulling away from the
[2:29:19] Shadows
[2:29:21] into Divine
[2:29:25] relationship Divine
[2:29:29] Fellowship not just
[2:29:32] bread but the true
[2:29:34] bread not just the right Doctrine
[2:29:38] now going beyond the right
[2:29:43] Doctrine until it can bring
[2:29:46] us the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:29:50] to become our
[2:29:52] companion that's the next
[2:29:54] Revival that we are thinking about
[2:29:58] that's where can be able to draw the
[2:30:01] rapturing
[2:30:04] faith are you together with me not from
[2:30:07] the
[2:30:08] Shadows not just knowing what is
[2:30:12] Right
[2:30:14] teaching what is Right must produce a
[2:30:18] person
[2:30:20] the Lord Jesus Christ so that he may
[2:30:22] become your
[2:30:24] companion that's the only way can work
[2:30:29] you into the body
[2:30:34] change praise the Lord that's my
[2:30:38] desire in this hour amen from the
[2:30:43] shadow to the
[2:30:45] subance praise
[2:30:47] God Amen let me give you this last
[2:30:52] qu you love him amen since this
[2:30:57] word this
[2:31:00] word indeed expresses perfect
[2:31:05] realization as against the
[2:31:08] idea of paral
[2:31:11] realization as Illustrated in those
[2:31:16] verses we can Now understand
[2:31:20] as never
[2:31:22] before amen take the example
[2:31:26] now of man from
[2:31:29] Heaven God sent
[2:31:32] down Angel bread from
[2:31:35] heaven isra but that bread did not
[2:31:41] satisfy it was only good for a
[2:31:45] day those who ate it were hungry again
[2:31:51] day if it was left
[2:31:55] around it became
[2:31:57] contaminated but Jesus hallelujah
[2:32:00] hallelujah but Jesus is the true
[2:32:04] bread from heaven where of
[2:32:08] man was just a
[2:32:10] type man eats of the
[2:32:14] bread that came from Heaven he will
[2:32:18] never hang again he does not need to
[2:32:21] come
[2:32:21] back and eat again the moment
[2:32:26] he he had eternal
[2:32:29] life was
[2:32:32] reality no need any longer for
[2:32:35] Shad no need for a paral
[2:32:38] Salvation here is the wall of
[2:32:41] it just like Jesus isn't a part of
[2:32:46] God God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:32:50] amen we are not looking for paral
[2:32:53] realization although it takes the paral
[2:32:57] realization to teach us the perfect
[2:33:01] realization but when you realize the
[2:33:03] perfect
[2:33:06] realization take it that is
[2:33:09] Christ so the next
[2:33:12] Revival is a people that will be seeing
[2:33:17] Christ in the word
[2:33:20] and pick him as life into the soul and
[2:33:26] that will transform Our
[2:33:28] Lives praise the Lord that's the only
[2:33:31] thing that will transform our
[2:33:33] Liv there must always
[2:33:36] be Revival to every
[2:33:40] generation God bless you God bless
[2:33:44] [Applause]
[2:33:46] you it's good to the word and the word
[2:33:53] will take you to the
[2:33:54] word the person the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:33:59] what makes us
[2:34:00] Believers is no longer the
[2:34:03] letter what makes us Believers is if we
[2:34:07] can take the
[2:34:08] life of the letter and take it and
[2:34:14] Christ lives on the side of God bless
[2:34:17] you
[2:34:22] God bless you amen it's my
[2:34:25] desire it's my
[2:34:28] prayer
[2:34:31] weaknesses praise the Lord those
[2:34:34] weaknesses are
[2:34:35] there because we have
[2:34:39] taken the life out of the
[2:34:43] world we read the
[2:34:46] word just as a
[2:34:48] letter but I pray the Lord gives us
[2:34:52] Grace that we may take the
[2:34:56] life out of that word and live by it
[2:35:01] that's the next
[2:35:02] Revival not what I know about the
[2:35:05] godhead not what I know about the
[2:35:08] serpent SE not what I know about the
[2:35:11] prophet but going beyond the
[2:35:15] prophet into
[2:35:17] fellowship with Christ
[2:35:20] his
[2:35:21] prophecy God bless
[2:35:24] you sessions are
[2:35:27] breaking isra are waking the signs that

[2:50:24] Jesus amen praise the name of our
[2:50:27] Lord we appreciate our pastor for the
[2:50:33] service amen
[2:50:35] amen each and every one of
[2:50:38] us we must have a cry in our
[2:50:44] hearts to be
[2:50:46] revived praise the name of our
[2:50:49] as the scriptures were
[2:50:52] read there are so many pressures we go
[2:50:56] through there are so many things that
[2:50:58] are distracting us away from
[2:51:02] God such a time of
[2:51:06] Darkness that's when the Lord
[2:51:09] comes but the Bible
[2:51:12] says blessed is that
[2:51:16] servant whom his master will find so
[2:51:21] doing so each and every one of us has to
[2:51:24] cry for a
[2:51:27] Revival praise the name of our Lord
[2:51:30] individual as a
[2:51:32] person as a
[2:51:34] parent or as a child at
[2:51:36] home or wherever you are or somebody who
[2:51:40] is
[2:51:41] working or maybe
[2:51:44] housewife maybe a farmer
[2:51:49] professional or business
[2:51:52] person because the Rapture is not going
[2:51:55] to be
[2:51:58] segregative either you at work it if you
[2:52:01] are ready you will be taken when you
[2:52:03] ready either you at home if you are
[2:52:06] ready you'll be taken when you or maybe
[2:52:09] you'll be
[2:52:10] sleeping if you are ready you be taken
[2:52:14] so each of us has to cry for a Revival
[2:52:18] ourselves as people our families our
[2:52:23] children everywhere praise the name of
[2:52:26] our we just need to take it so
[2:52:31] serious praise the name of our Lord we
[2:52:35] we are meant to have an overnight on
[2:52:40] Friday this
[2:52:42] Friday but because we have a youth
[2:52:45] concert of Music on Sunday
[2:52:50] we shall see we shall not have an
[2:52:52] overnight on
[2:53:17] Friday
