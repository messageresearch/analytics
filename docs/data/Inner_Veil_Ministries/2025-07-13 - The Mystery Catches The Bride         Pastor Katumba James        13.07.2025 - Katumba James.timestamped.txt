[42:03] So just keep him in your prayers.
[42:07] And then we have visitors who are coming
[42:09] here for the first time.
[42:12] There is a brother called Isaac. If you
[42:14] can stand up.
[42:21] [Applause]

[42:32] direction on the radio.
[42:34] Thank you for coming today.
[42:38] Then there is a brother called Emma.

[43:14] meeting here.
[43:17] So it's better to come and be part of

[43:21] Then on Sunday that's next Sunday
[43:26] that is 20th of July

[43:31] the afternoon services for the youth.
[43:35] Praise the name of her. Now before
[43:37] before the word call on the can and sing
[43:41] for us.
[43:46] Praise the name of our lord. There's a
[43:49] song which I had in my heart in the
[43:51] course of the week
[43:55] and then you know I failed to find the
[43:57] release
[44:00] but you see the young generation doesn't
[44:02] know that song. as you come forward.
[44:06] So I was asking hope
[44:09] and then she said it's only maybe
[44:11] brother simple can give us the relics
[44:16] you know I'll talk about the jubilee.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; So I think we shall pick up those old
[44:22] songs which were around in the '9s
[44:27] and then bring them back which were
[44:30] composed by the youth in the church
[44:31] here.
[44:34] Amen. Amen.

[45:37] the journey
[45:40] and lightens
[45:42] every heavy load.
[45:49] It's not an easy road.
[45:54] We are traveling

[46:01] other songs on the way

[49:18] And Jesus

[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us clap for them again. Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; It's not an easy road. Praise the name
[50:25] of our Lord. The Lord gives us the
[50:28] grace.
[50:29] Praise the name of our Lord. We're just
[50:31] depending upon the grace of God this
[50:33] morning.
[50:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us
[50:38] stand up and go to Revelations chapter
[50:39] 10.
[50:43] We are reading from verse 7 to verse 11.
[50:48] Today I want to minister on the mystery
[50:50] catches the bride.
[50:58] Praise the name of our Lord. The mystery
[51:01] catches the bride.
[51:03] Just as we are looking for the bride of
[51:05] Christ,
[51:08] we need to use the mystery
[51:10] to pick them out
[51:13] because it's the same mystery
[51:16] that also got us out.
[51:19] So, Revelations chapter 10.
[51:23] Before we read, let us pray again.
[51:26] Father, we thank you this morning
[51:30] for the opportunity that we can still
[51:32] share on the word of God.
[51:37] Now that we are not reading stories,
[51:40] we're not reading theology,
[51:43] but we are reading the mind of God
[51:45] himself.
[51:47] that we are thankful father that you've
[51:50] made the Bible
[51:52] to become a living book in our ministry
[51:55] in our lives father by the revelation of
[51:58] the message of the earth
[52:02] may come again speak to our hearts
[52:04] that each and every one of us may find
[52:08] his portion in your word today
[52:11] that also by the portion you've given
[52:13] unto us
[52:15] we may be able to share with others
[52:18] and bring the elect out of where they
[52:20] are
[52:21] that all together we be a body of our
[52:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[52:26] ready for the rapture. Lord, help us in
[52:29] everything. Father, bless us all
[52:31] together. Let's remember many of our
[52:34] brothers and sisters
[52:36] who are part of the fellowship but they
[52:38] are online.
[52:40] We lift them into your hearts also.
[52:43] Lord, you may speak their hearts in such
[52:44] a special way.
[52:46] bless us together in the name of the
[52:49] Lord Jesus who grant us.
[52:52] Amen. Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; So, Revelations chapter 10,
[52:56] we're reading from verse 7 to verse 11.
[53:03] Remember two weeks ago we were also
[53:04] reading this same scripture
[53:08] when we were sharing on you must
[53:09] prophesy again.
[53:13] Revelations 10:7.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[53:19] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[53:22] sound, the mystery of God should be
[53:25] finished, as he has declared to his
[53:27] servants the prophets.
[53:41] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[53:43] spoke unto me again, said, "Go and take
[53:46] the little book which is open in the
[53:48] hand of the angel which stands upon the
[53:51] sea and upon the earth.
[54:08] And I went unto the angel, and said unto
[54:11] him, Give me the little book. And he
[54:14] said unto me, Take it, and eat it up,
[54:17] and shall make thy belly bitter, but
[54:19] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[54:37] And I took the little book out of the
[54:39] angel's hand and ate it. And it was in
[54:42] my mouth, sweet as honey. And as soon as
[54:46] I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[55:04] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[55:08] again before many peoples and nations
[55:11] and tongues and kings.
[55:22] May God sing of his word. You may be.
[55:28] So we want to minister on the mystery
[55:30] catches the bride.
[55:34] Praise the name of our Lord. The mystery
[55:37] catches the bride.
[55:39] You know many denominations
[55:43] they read this same Bible that we read.
[55:48] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[55:50] they can even have lessons on the Bible.
[55:55] You know like people are doing maybe
[55:59] level or a level
[56:04] senior one up to four
[56:08] and then they go and maybe study the
[56:10] book of Luke
[56:12] and then they said you know Luke
[56:15] Luke was not there when Jesus was there
[56:19] even said
[56:21] that what I heard others say
[56:24] that's also what I wrote.
[56:28] So now they discredit it there and then
[56:32] and then they go and pick some kind of
[56:34] variances in the scriptures.
[56:40] Then they say here he says they were
[56:42] this.
[56:44] Then here he says they were this.
[56:48] And then they bring all those negative
[56:50] things
[56:52] and then they discredit the Bible.
[56:55] They don't take the Bible
[56:58] as the word of God.
[57:01] They don't take the Bible as the
[57:04] absolute
[57:06] you know then they would say but there
[57:07] has to be an explanation.
[57:11] No, but you know this book, this book is
[57:13] an old book.
[57:15] When you read in the book of Genesis
[57:19] talking about the life of people,
[57:22] Adam, then talks about faith, then it
[57:26] comes to Noah, then again Abraham,
[57:30] then Jacob, then they start asking.
[57:33] There were no other people they would
[57:35] talk about.
[57:38] Only those people. No, this book is not
[57:41] fair.
[57:42] You mean of all the the nations in the
[57:44] earth,
[57:46] it's only Israel which would be talked
[57:48] about.
[57:50] This man Jacob is a suppler
[57:53] who cheated his brother
[57:56] is the man they saying is Israel
[57:59] said no they don't understand the way of
[58:03] God.
[58:05] So it's a mystery to them.
[58:08] Praise the name of our Lord. And you see
[58:10] how the Bible was written.
[58:13] The Bible was written in symbols.
[58:18] Like for example in Genesis,
[58:21] you know, Genesis chapter 2.
[58:25] Then he says there were two trees in the
[58:27] middle of the garden.
[58:29] And so they look for those two trees
[58:31] physically.
[58:34] But those are symbols.
[58:36] And then the Bible is also written in
[58:38] shadows.
[58:41] You know, in other words, it is a kind
[58:43] of life story of somebody,
[58:46] but then it is hiding a truth behind it.
[58:52] Then it's written in things like types.
[58:58] But you know it it is just a shadow. It
[59:01] is something but hiding a truth behind.
[59:06] Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[59:08] like when he talks about trees,
[59:11] you know, you need to get into other
[59:13] areas.
[59:15] You know, what does this symbol mean?
[59:19] Praise the name of our Lord. Like when
[59:20] Adam and Eve were naked after eating of
[59:23] the tree,
[59:25] God dressed them by putting a skin
[59:28] around them.
[59:30] But you see it doesn't say
[59:33] he killed an animal.
[59:36] It is silent about that.
[59:39] But then how could he get a skin without
[59:41] killing an animal?
[59:46] And then now that was the first
[59:48] sacrifice he made
[59:51] that he had to shed the blood
[59:53] to cover their sin and then cover their
[59:56] nakedness.
[59:58] So the Bible there
[1:00:01] is actually silent.
[1:00:05] It takes the elect
[1:00:08] to know what exactly happened.
[1:00:12] So to the intellectuals,
[1:00:16] you know, they can't get that kind.
[1:00:19] So now they read the Bible, they can
[1:00:22] even quote you the scriptures.
[1:00:26] Like I remember when we in scripture
[1:00:28] union,
[1:00:30] you know, and then there was always that
[1:00:32] kind of party for the students.
[1:00:36] At the end of the year, this this team
[1:00:38] is handing over the next team
[1:00:42] and then there was a session for the
[1:00:44] quiz
[1:00:47] and then they would start asking
[1:00:49] what is the shortest scripture in the
[1:00:51] Bible
[1:00:53] and then you must cram it.
[1:00:56] Ah Jesus wept. It is John this and this
[1:01:00] that is correct. Which is the longest
[1:01:02] chapter in the Bible?
[1:01:05] Psalms 119.
[1:01:08] That is correct. Then you know many
[1:01:10] different question
[1:01:13] but knowing that cannot give you life
[1:01:16] eternal.
[1:01:18] It has to be a revelation
[1:01:21] from the Lord himself
[1:01:24] that gives you eternal life.
[1:01:27] Praise the name of our Lord. And now
[1:01:29] that's where the bride is caught in.
[1:01:34] That's where the bride is brought in.
[1:01:38] The mystery catches the bride.
[1:01:41] So in Revelations 10:7,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "But in the days of the
[1:01:47] voice of the seventh angel,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound,
[1:01:56] the mystery of God,
[1:01:59] should be finished."
[1:02:01] So now the Bible is telling us at the
[1:02:04] sounding of the seventh angel
[1:02:07] and the seventh angel
[1:02:10] is the messenger of the Lordian church
[1:02:12] name
[1:02:14] in Revelations chapter 3 and then verse
[1:02:18] 14
[1:02:20] unto the angel of Lord
[1:02:23] write this
[1:02:26] praise the name of our Lord. So is the
[1:02:28] seventh angel. So he says the seventh
[1:02:31] angel will have to finish the mystery
[1:02:37] all what has been hidden
[1:02:40] through the ages.
[1:02:42] Now Daniel
[1:02:44] during his time he saw some of these
[1:02:48] mysteries
[1:02:50] and then Daniel
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; desire to know
[1:02:54] and then he said oh my lord
[1:02:57] Daniel chapter 12
[1:03:00] praise the name of our Lord. Daniel 12
[1:03:03] and then verse 4.
[1:03:06] The Bible says,
[1:03:09] "But though, oh Daniel, shut up the
[1:03:13] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:03:16] of the end, and many shall run to and
[1:03:20] fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
[1:03:38] Praise the name of our Lord. So the book
[1:03:42] you know was a scroll.
[1:03:45] Praise the name of our Lord. You know
[1:03:47] the books those days were not like these
[1:03:48] ones here we have.
[1:03:52] There were rolls
[1:03:55] rolled like this
[1:03:58] and then it was sealed
[1:04:02] seven seals.
[1:04:04] And then now the angel is telling
[1:04:06] Daniel,
[1:04:09] seal up the book
[1:04:12] up to when? Up to the time of the end.
[1:04:17] So now at the end
[1:04:20] the book
[1:04:21] has to be the seals have to be opened.
[1:04:26] The truth has to be known
[1:04:29] what is inside in the book.
[1:04:32] So now in Daniel chapter 12
[1:04:35] and then verse 8 and verse 9,
[1:04:39] he said, "And I heard but I understood
[1:04:42] not."
[1:04:44] Then I said, "Oh my Lord,
[1:04:48] what shall be the end of these things?"
[1:04:53] And he said, "Go thy way, Daniel,
[1:04:58] for the words are closed up
[1:05:02] and seal till the time of the end
[1:05:08] that settled Daniel.
[1:05:11] Praise the name of our Lord." And so you
[1:05:13] see that Daniel,
[1:05:15] he was told that they are sealed until
[1:05:17] the time of the end.
[1:05:22] Now in Revelations chapter 5,
[1:05:26] we see the Bible says in verse one, "And
[1:05:30] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:05:32] on the throne a book written within and
[1:05:36] on the backside sealed with seven seals.
[1:05:54] Praise the name of our Lord. So he says
[1:05:56] the book was written
[1:05:59] within
[1:06:01] and on the outside
[1:06:05] and then sealed with seven seals
[1:06:09] you know like there's a roll seal here
[1:06:12] another seal seven times
[1:06:15] and then brother Brandon when he was
[1:06:16] preaching about the seven seals
[1:06:20] that the book talks about the white
[1:06:23] horse,
[1:06:26] red horse, black horse,
[1:06:30] pale horse,
[1:06:33] that's all somebody can talk about.
[1:06:37] Praise the name of our Lord. And you
[1:06:39] know when the the when John was seeing
[1:06:43] he was seeing motions
[1:06:46] you know things taking place. I saw a
[1:06:48] right white horse rider come then he did
[1:06:51] this and this then I heard one living
[1:06:53] creature say come and see
[1:06:57] now symbols only.
[1:07:00] So now today the people who are not the
[1:07:03] elect
[1:07:06] they stop at the white horse,
[1:07:09] black horse,
[1:07:11] red horse and then they start thinking
[1:07:14] ah that white horse that is Christ
[1:07:18] conquering everywhere
[1:07:21] red horse you know it's the blood that
[1:07:24] washes us how Christ shed his blood
[1:07:28] up down this black
[1:07:31] I think there is a time the devil came
[1:07:32] here
[1:07:34] but again per horse
[1:07:37] they get confused
[1:07:41] it is not for them
[1:07:43] but then he says these mysteries
[1:07:47] they are meant to be opened
[1:07:50] at the end of the time
[1:07:54] praise the name of it is these mysteries
[1:07:58] that catch the bride
[1:08:00] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[1:08:02] makes us different
[1:08:05] from the rest of the denomination.
[1:08:08] We are reading an open book
[1:08:11] for them. They are reading a closed
[1:08:12] book.
[1:08:14] You know when he said go and baptize in
[1:08:16] the name of the father, the son and the
[1:08:17] holy ghost.
[1:08:20] Me I'm doing what Jesus said.
[1:08:23] Close the book.
[1:08:25] For you are following Peter. Me I'm
[1:08:27] follow Jesus.
[1:08:30] Then you ask them who did he tell you or
[1:08:33] Peter?
[1:08:37] But Peter didn't do what Jesus told him.
[1:08:40] They are reading from a closed book.
[1:08:44] But because of the message of the hour,
[1:08:48] we know what the name of the father, the
[1:08:50] son, and the holy ghost is
[1:08:54] the lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name
[1:08:57] of our lord. when they read a closed
[1:08:59] book
[1:09:01] they see three
[1:09:03] the father here
[1:09:06] the holy ghost here. So even when they
[1:09:08] are blessing
[1:09:10] they want to use the three signs
[1:09:14] this and then this
[1:09:17] then because it's a closed book
[1:09:20] to them. So when they look at God they
[1:09:25] say trinity
[1:09:27] closed bookh
[1:09:29] you know there is father here
[1:09:32] then there is a son here
[1:09:34] then there is the holy ghost here and
[1:09:37] then you ask them matthew 1 verse 18 say
[1:09:43] Mary was born with the child of the holy
[1:09:46] ghost.
[1:09:50] Now if you said the father is here and
[1:09:53] the son is here and the holy ghost is
[1:09:55] here of this father and this holy ghost
[1:09:59] who was the father of this son.
[1:10:01] When the bible says Mary was born with a
[1:10:04] child of the holy ghost
[1:10:07] Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 and verse 20.
[1:10:11] Can a person have two fathers?
[1:10:15] Said no no no.
[1:10:17] Then they get shocked and they and when
[1:10:19] you open these scriptures to them
[1:10:23] say but is that but you give me my Bible
[1:10:25] is my
[1:10:31] they are seeing them for the first time
[1:10:36] closed book
[1:10:39] when you tell them
[1:10:41] that there's no trinity in the Bible
[1:10:45] they can fight you
[1:10:47] They reading a closed book.
[1:10:50] Praise the name of our Lord. So it takes
[1:10:52] the revelation of Christ
[1:10:55] to know when Jesus said the Lord our God
[1:11:01] is one Lord,
[1:11:05] not two Lord, not three Lord. And then
[1:11:09] you ask them, who is that Lord? Of
[1:11:12] course the father.
[1:11:15] Then you ask them if we go to John
[1:11:18] chapter 20.
[1:11:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[1:11:22] and pick that scripture.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; John chapter 20
[1:11:33] and then
[1:11:37] let us get John chapter 20 and then
[1:11:40] verse 30.
[1:11:45] And the other sign, okay, I just beg
[1:11:48] your pardon.
[1:11:50] Verse 28.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And Thomas answered and said unto him,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; "My Lord and my God, you ask them." Who
[1:12:01] was Thomas saying that?
[1:12:04] He was telling Jesus. He was telling
[1:12:06] Jesus that you are my Lord and my God.
[1:12:11] You ask them, "Was Jesus the second Lord
[1:12:13] or the third Lord?"
[1:12:18] And ask them, "Was Jesus the second God
[1:12:22] or the third God?"
[1:12:25] Because Jesus himself said
[1:12:28] in Mark 12,
[1:12:32] "Praise the name of our Lord." Mark 12
[1:12:36] and then verse 29.
[1:12:38] Jesus said,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered him and said,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; "The first of all the commandments is
[1:12:49] here. O Israel,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; the Lord our God
[1:12:55] is one Lord.
[1:12:58] The Lord our God is one Lord." Then you
[1:13:03] ask him of this father, Son, and the
[1:13:06] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:08] Who is your Lord?
[1:13:12] He can't answer you.
[1:13:14] But Jesus Christ is the Lord God
[1:13:18] Almighty.
[1:13:21] One Lord, one God is our Lord Jesus
[1:13:25] Christ and they don't want to hear that
[1:13:28] that is Jesus only Jesus only.
[1:13:32] They don't understand.
[1:13:35] They are reading from a closed book.
[1:13:40] They used to many gods
[1:13:44] like the Syrians.
[1:13:46] They were telling the the the the arm of
[1:13:49] Syria was telling their king
[1:13:53] that you know their god is the god of
[1:13:55] the mountain.
[1:13:57] That's why they build the mount the
[1:13:59] temple on the mountain
[1:14:02] and we had the battle on the mountain
[1:14:05] that God knows mountains.
[1:14:07] Then he said let us get the same army
[1:14:09] back and now let us go and fight them in
[1:14:12] the valley.
[1:14:15] You know that is actually how pagans
[1:14:18] think.
[1:14:22] One will have a small go
[1:14:30] of the rain.
[1:14:33] If it doesn't rain, he goes to the of
[1:14:36] the rain.
[1:14:39] Or when it's shining so much, it goes to
[1:14:41] the That's why you find they have many
[1:14:43] shrines.
[1:14:46] There is this shine for this. This one
[1:14:48] for this, this one is for this. And
[1:14:51] that's what is
[1:14:55] somebody today praising the father.
[1:15:02] Thank you for bringing me on earth.
[1:15:06] The first day the father
[1:15:10] reme
[1:15:17] the second day praise in the name of the
[1:15:18] son.
[1:15:20] The third remedy
[1:15:23] holy spirit
[1:15:25] don't leave me
[1:15:27] don't leave me holy spirit
[1:15:30] after 3 days
[1:15:33] he knows that now he has worshiped us
[1:15:36] speak in the name of
[1:15:38] the name of the son the name of the holy
[1:15:41] spirit
[1:15:44] others are engaged
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; they they w them
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; they them in the name of
[1:15:53] There is no scripture
[1:15:55] that pray in the name of the father, the
[1:15:57] son, and the
[1:16:00] closed book today.
[1:16:03] Praise the name of our lord. So we need
[1:16:05] to take the revelation of the word
[1:16:09] and tell them my brother
[1:16:12] worship is false.
[1:16:14] Trinity is not even in the bible.
[1:16:17] It's only one God and that one God
[1:16:21] manifested as the father
[1:16:24] in the Old Testament, God above us. Then
[1:16:28] he manifested as the son
[1:16:31] in the four gospels,
[1:16:33] God with us.
[1:16:35] That's Emmanuel,
[1:16:37] God as the son.
[1:16:40] And then he manifested himself as the
[1:16:41] Holy Spirit
[1:16:44] from the day from the book of Acts on
[1:16:47] the day of Pentecost. God now in us
[1:16:52] one Lord just changing his
[1:16:54] manifestation.
[1:16:56] Praise the name of our Lord as the
[1:16:58] father, God above us, God who cannot be
[1:17:03] seen. But that God who cannot be seen,
[1:17:06] he put on a body and we called him the
[1:17:09] Lord Jesus Christ. Praise the name of
[1:17:12] our Lord. He walked amongst us.
[1:17:15] God in the tabernacle of a human being.
[1:17:20] God Jesus Christ being woripped by
[1:17:23] angels.
[1:17:24] You know the Bible says don't worship
[1:17:27] anybody
[1:17:29] because that's the first commandment.
[1:17:33] Exodus chapter 20.
[1:17:37] You shall not have any other god
[1:17:42] beside me and you not make any person to
[1:17:46] worship either in heaven
[1:17:49] or the earth. But they don't understand
[1:17:53] when Jesus comes he's worshiped.
[1:17:58] They don't understand it. Even angels
[1:18:00] worship Jesus.
[1:18:03] And he said, "If you don't know that I
[1:18:05] am he,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; you'll die in your sin."
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit which was in the
[1:18:12] Pharisees,
[1:18:14] which were rejecting Jesus Christ to be
[1:18:17] the Messiah, which were rejecting Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ, be the Lord God Almighty, is the
[1:18:23] same spirit now that has brought the
[1:18:25] trinity.
[1:18:27] And the trinity binds them together.
[1:18:31] It puts a mark on them
[1:18:34] to worship the beast.
[1:18:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So we have
[1:18:38] the mysteries revealed.
[1:18:41] The message of the hour reveals the
[1:18:44] mysteries
[1:18:46] and be confident my brother, my sister
[1:18:50] at your place of work. Testify about
[1:18:53] what God has done.
[1:18:56] Tell them the revelation.
[1:18:58] Tell them baptism of little children is
[1:19:00] not Christ.
[1:19:03] Tell them just pouring water in the
[1:19:05] forehead is not baptism.
[1:19:09] Tell them baptizing in the name of the
[1:19:11] father, the son and holy ghost is not is
[1:19:13] not what the commandment was saying
[1:19:19] because told them baptize in the name.
[1:19:22] So what do you do? mention the name and
[1:19:26] the name of the father, the son and the
[1:19:28] holy ghost
[1:19:30] is the lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:32] That's how every person in the bible
[1:19:36] the book of acts everybody was baptized
[1:19:39] in the name of the lord
[1:19:42] not father son and the holy ghost.
[1:19:46] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[1:19:47] there are many mysteries.
[1:19:50] Now
[1:19:52] let us go in the message says is this
[1:19:54] the time
[1:19:58] praise the name of our lord he says
[1:20:02] in paragraph 241
[1:20:06] the seventh angel of revelations 10:7
[1:20:13] is the seventh church age messenger
[1:20:17] and in the
[1:20:20] But in the voice of the voice of the
[1:20:22] seventh angel,
[1:20:25] when he shall begin to sound,
[1:20:29] the mystery of God should be finished.
[1:20:35] Now sounding forth this messenger,
[1:20:44] the seventh angel.
[1:20:47] here is sounding forth his message
[1:20:52] to the Lordian church.
[1:20:55] Notice his type of message.
[1:20:59] Now it wasn't to the first angel.
[1:21:02] It was not given to the second angel,
[1:21:05] third, fourth, fifth, sixth. But it is
[1:21:09] the seventh angel
[1:21:12] that has this type of message.
[1:21:16] What was it? Notice his message.
[1:21:21] Finishing all the mysteries
[1:21:25] that are written in the book
[1:21:29] like we have read in Daniel chapter 12
[1:21:32] verse 8 and verse 9 because seal up the
[1:21:35] mysteries.
[1:21:37] Seal up the book. It will not be
[1:21:39] revealed
[1:21:41] until the end of the time. And then at
[1:21:44] the end of the time, God sent the
[1:21:47] seventh angel.
[1:21:49] And the seventh angel by the proof of
[1:21:52] God
[1:21:53] is William Marion Branham. William and
[1:21:57] God sent him with a message.
[1:22:00] And the message that God sent him is
[1:22:03] prepared. The bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] for the rapture. Praise the name of our
[1:22:08] Lord. The message that was given is
[1:22:12] prepare the bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:22:14] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:16] Christ. So now it is the mystery here
[1:22:20] that catches the bride. Without the
[1:22:23] mystery, you'll not get the bride.
[1:22:27] Praise the name of our Lord. But it's
[1:22:28] the mystery that makes the difference
[1:22:33] because we have got the revelation
[1:22:36] of the mysteries where the other people
[1:22:38] are doing whatever they want to do. The
[1:22:41] bride of Jesus Christ has the mind of
[1:22:44] God. Praise the name of our Lord and
[1:22:47] that should make us
[1:22:49] obedient to the message that we have
[1:22:51] got.
[1:22:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Be obedient
[1:22:55] to the message.
[1:22:57] Then he says, "The finishing of all the
[1:22:59] mysteries of God
[1:23:02] that are written in the book,
[1:23:05] the seventh angel is winding up all the
[1:23:09] mysteries
[1:23:11] that's lying loose ended
[1:23:15] all through these organizations and
[1:23:17] denominations.
[1:23:19] The seventh angel gathers them up
[1:23:23] and finishes the entire mystery.
[1:23:28] That's what the Bible said. Finishes the
[1:23:31] mystery of the book.
[1:23:34] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[1:23:36] paragraph 243.
[1:23:40] Then he says, now let us note some of a
[1:23:45] few mysteries.
[1:23:47] He says paragraph 245.
[1:23:52] Number one, the mystery of the kingdom
[1:23:55] of heaven.
[1:23:58] That's John talking about in Matthew
[1:24:01] chapter 13.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; The second mystery is the mystery of
[1:24:07] Israel's blindness during this age.
[1:24:13] Revelations 11:2 rather Romans 11:25.
[1:24:19] The third mystery is the translation of
[1:24:21] the living saints
[1:24:25] at the end of this age.
[1:24:28] 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[1:24:31] and also 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[1:24:35] 14 to verse 17.
[1:24:38] The fourth mystery, the mystery of the
[1:24:41] New Testament church
[1:24:47] as one body composed of both Jews and
[1:24:50] Gentiles.
[1:24:54] Then he gives Ephesians chapter 3
[1:24:58] verse 1 to verse 11,
[1:25:00] Romans chapter 16 verse 25 and Ephesians
[1:25:05] chapter 6 verse 19.
[1:25:08] Colossians 4:3.
[1:25:11] The fifth mystery is of the church as
[1:25:14] the bride of Christ.
[1:25:18] Ephesians 5:28:32.
[1:25:24] The sixth mystery is of the living
[1:25:27] Christ,
[1:25:29] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:25:33] Colossians 2:20
[1:25:35] and Hebrews chapter 13:8,
[1:25:42] the seventh mystery is God,
[1:25:45] even Christ as the incarnate fullness of
[1:25:48] the godhead bodily
[1:25:52] and godliness restored to man.
[1:25:56] The ninth mystery, the mystery of
[1:25:59] iniquity
[1:26:01] found in second Thessalonians.
[1:26:04] The 10th mystery
[1:26:06] is of the seven stars of Revelations
[1:26:08] 120.
[1:26:14] The 11th mystery is the mystery Babylon,
[1:26:20] the prostitute.
[1:26:23] Like there was somebody who was
[1:26:24] preaching on radio sometime I think last
[1:26:26] year before last year
[1:26:29] and then she was saying
[1:26:34] is so big
[1:26:37] and the definition of Babylon
[1:26:42] it was offsite
[1:26:49] contradicting
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; back to the message of the hour that's
[1:26:52] why you'll the revelation of these
[1:26:54] mysteries.
[1:26:56] And then he says, "And some of these
[1:26:58] mystery
[1:27:10] seed
[1:27:12] that has been hidden mystery
[1:27:16] through the years.
[1:27:18] Talk about the serpent seat.
[1:27:23] They will think you are blaming
[1:27:27] when you tell them the serpent
[1:27:32] was a living up upright walking creature
[1:27:38] as a person
[1:27:41] and it could talk. It could reason
[1:27:45] until the serpent. The devil entered the
[1:27:48] serpent
[1:27:52] and made sure the serpent deceives Eve.
[1:27:57] And the serpent
[1:27:59] slept with Eve.
[1:28:01] They don't want to hear that.
[1:28:04] They don't want No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:28:08] Closed book.
[1:28:14] Then you ask them if they ate an apple,
[1:28:20] how many have you eaten yourself?
[1:28:23] And then you have not sinned.
[1:28:28] And the Bible says what goes into the
[1:28:33] mouth
[1:28:35] does not defile.
[1:28:38] So you must know that there's another
[1:28:40] eating.
[1:28:43] Praise the name of our Lord. The way the
[1:28:45] Bible says
[1:28:47] that she eats
[1:28:49] and then she wipes the mouth that have
[1:28:51] not eaten.
[1:28:53] I was talking about a prostitute
[1:28:57] that a prostitute eats and says I've not
[1:28:58] eaten.
[1:29:01] They don't eat mangoes.
[1:29:04] Praise the name of the Lord. So they
[1:29:06] just read from a closed book.
[1:29:13] How do you eat
[1:29:15] and the curse is not on the mouth
[1:29:20] but goes in other places?
[1:29:23] Why?
[1:29:24] You know it's a closed book.
[1:29:27] So they just read
[1:29:38] how you read your scriptures.
[1:29:41] blind eyes.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Then he says
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; the mystery,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:29:52] grace straightened out, not disgrace,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; real true grace.
[1:30:06] Now you know all these kind of things
[1:30:09] People
[1:30:11] had various understandings which were
[1:30:14] contrary to the scripture
[1:30:17] and then somebody will say ah God has
[1:30:19] given us grace
[1:30:22] grace is enough
[1:30:26] now he goes to disco because there is
[1:30:28] grace
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm told that there is some some
[1:30:30] congregation in campala
[1:30:35] they don't care how you behave
[1:30:39] how you dress.
[1:30:43] So the youth are there too many of them
[1:30:48] fornicating
[1:30:50] grace
[1:30:52] drinking
[1:30:55] that's not the grace of God. If the
[1:30:57] grace of God touches your heart,
[1:31:01] the same grace tells you go and sin no
[1:31:05] more.
[1:31:07] And that same grace gives you the
[1:31:10] ability not to go and sin.
[1:31:14] Because by giving you the spirit of
[1:31:16] Christ,
[1:31:18] the spirit of Christ changes your nature
[1:31:22] that you hate the things you are doing.
[1:31:25] Praise the name of our Lord. That's the
[1:31:27] grace of God is that it delivers you.
[1:31:32] You live that sin and you hate it.
[1:31:36] That's the grace of God.
[1:31:40] Not saying that there is grace.
[1:31:44] Even if I walk the way you want, you
[1:31:45] have not seen the grace. If you see the
[1:31:48] grace of God, you'll say Lord have
[1:31:51] mercy.
[1:31:52] Lord forgive me. Lord deliver me. And
[1:31:56] you don't want to go back.
[1:31:59] See the grace of God. David,
[1:32:03] he went and committed adultery.
[1:32:06] after adultery, he made sure that the
[1:32:08] husband of that woman died
[1:32:12] for one whole year.
[1:32:16] He just kept on living until the child
[1:32:19] was born. And then God by his grace
[1:32:24] sent prophet,
[1:32:26] nothing comes, tells David a parable.
[1:32:31] Praise the name of our Lord. when he
[1:32:33] tells David a parable.
[1:32:37] This is very interesting. Now let us go
[1:32:40] to 1 Samuel 12. 2 Samuel chapter 12.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. 2 Samuel
[1:32:49] 12.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse one. And the Lord
[1:33:00] sent Nathan unto David. And okay, let us
[1:33:04] speak from uh
[1:33:08] from verse 1st Samuel 2 Samuel 11 verse
[1:33:13] 26.
[1:33:19] And when the wife of heard that her
[1:33:22] husband was dead, she mourned for her
[1:33:24] husband.
[1:33:33] And when the morning was passed, David
[1:33:36] sent and fetched her to his house, and
[1:33:39] she became his wife, and bear him a son.
[1:33:42] But the thing that David had done
[1:33:46] displeased the Lord.
[1:34:05] David in that situation
[1:34:09] one year
[1:34:11] and the Bible says it displeased God
[1:34:16] bearing with him
[1:34:19] and sometimes God bears with us like
[1:34:21] that.
[1:34:23] you do something sometime
[1:34:25] as if God doesn't know that you've done
[1:34:27] it
[1:34:29] just bearing with you.
[1:34:32] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[1:34:34] after that time,
[1:34:36] God sent Nathan
[1:34:39] to David
[1:34:41] and Nathan as a prophet.
[1:34:44] Praise the name of our Lord. He came
[1:34:46] with a closed book
[1:34:49] and then he gave David a closed book.
[1:34:53] And now when David received the closed
[1:34:55] book,
[1:34:57] the parable,
[1:34:58] there was a rich man,
[1:35:01] he had many sheep.
[1:35:04] But when he got a visitor come from a
[1:35:06] far country,
[1:35:09] he said, "I have to spare my sheep."
[1:35:12] Then he went and picked the one of a
[1:35:14] poor man.
[1:35:18] The only ship he has
[1:35:21] and dressed it for his vista.
[1:35:24] Last can be a visa really.
[1:35:29] But don't entertain that vis.
[1:35:32] And sometimes that vister can come at
[1:35:34] your place of work.
[1:35:38] Don't give him wrong.
[1:35:40] Sometimes that vista can come in your
[1:35:42] neighborhood.
[1:35:47] Sometimes the vista can come among the
[1:35:49] relatives of your wife.
[1:36:01] So David
[1:36:03] for him he got the poor man's ship
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; and dressed it to his vister
[1:36:12] and then because it was a parable.
[1:36:16] It was a sealed book.
[1:36:20] Now you see why it is important
[1:36:23] to have the book to read the book when
[1:36:26] it is open.
[1:36:28] When you read the book when it is
[1:36:29] closed,
[1:36:31] you can't realize your sin.
[1:36:34] You can't realize you know how bad you
[1:36:36] are before God.
[1:36:39] May I pray in the name of the father
[1:36:42] and the holy God hears. Maybe I'm
[1:36:46] reading what he said. Even David was
[1:36:50] following what Nathan was telling him
[1:36:53] about the parable of the rich man and
[1:36:54] the poor man.
[1:36:57] And when David heard that,
[1:37:00] praise the name of our Lord, let us
[1:37:02] continue in that story again.
[1:37:04] 2 Samuel 12
[1:37:08] and then verse four.
[1:37:11] And there came a traveler and the rich
[1:37:13] man and his spare to take his own flock
[1:37:16] and of his own heart to dress for the
[1:37:18] wayfairing man that was come unto him.
[1:37:21] but took the poor man's lamp and dressed
[1:37:24] it for the man that was come to him.
[1:37:45] Praise the name of our Lord. David was
[1:37:49] reading from a closed book
[1:37:52] parable.
[1:37:54] You know like when Jesus went and told
[1:37:55] them that the ser went to s
[1:38:00] fell on the west side, some fell on the
[1:38:03] stony ground, some fell on the fatal
[1:38:06] ground,
[1:38:07] some fell in the thorns
[1:38:10] and you know there were many people who
[1:38:11] had come to listen the Lord Jesus.
[1:38:15] And after speaking to them, you know
[1:38:18] what he told them?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Till we meet,
[1:38:22] till we meet, we meet parables
[1:38:27] and the Bible says without parables
[1:38:31] he never talk to them.
[1:38:34] Let us pick up that scripture
[1:38:37] that without parables
[1:38:40] he never spoke to them
[1:38:42] in Mark 13:34.
[1:38:49] The Bible says, "All these things,
[1:38:54] spoke Jesus unto the multitude in
[1:38:56] parables,
[1:39:00] and without a parable
[1:39:03] spoke he not unto them,
[1:39:07] the multitude,
[1:39:10] the religious leaders,
[1:39:13] he speaks them in parables,
[1:39:16] the multit in universities and colleges
[1:39:18] and schools
[1:39:22] doing divinity
[1:39:24] parables
[1:39:26] doing
[1:39:28] parables
[1:39:32] they learning parables but without the
[1:39:34] interpretation
[1:39:37] so they end up confused
[1:39:40] when I read that book
[1:39:42] it's more confused
[1:39:46] parables
[1:39:47] without parables. He never talked to
[1:39:50] them.
[1:39:52] So now they come.
[1:39:56] God gave me a revelation here.
[1:39:59] You remember the other thing the Bible
[1:40:00] says. Now, like for example, when there
[1:40:03] was this marriage bill,
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; the marriage bill, marriage, marriage
[1:40:08] and divorce bill,
[1:40:15] there are some churches that came and
[1:40:17] said,
[1:40:19] you know, you know the Bible even
[1:40:21] polygamy is scripture.
[1:40:25] David had many, Solomon had many. Why
[1:40:29] would women be there without a husband?
[1:40:33] It's scripture. It's of God to be
[1:40:36] polygamat
[1:40:39] close the book.
[1:40:43] And so they end up on the parables
[1:40:47] and then get their interpretation on the
[1:40:49] parables
[1:40:51] or on the shadows
[1:40:53] and run with them.
[1:40:57] So even David
[1:40:59] when he had the parable
[1:41:01] the Bible says
[1:41:04] David was furious.
[1:41:08] Let us go back to first 2 Samuel 12:2
[1:41:16] verse 5. And David's anger was greatly
[1:41:19] kindled against the man.
[1:41:24] And he said unto Nathan,
[1:41:27] "As the Lord liveth,
[1:41:32] the man that has done this thing
[1:41:36] shall surely die.
[1:41:40] Selfrighteousness."
[1:41:43] Why? You're reading the parable. You're
[1:41:47] reading a closed book.
[1:41:50] I'm going to heaven.
[1:41:52] But you beat the sign.
[1:41:59] I thought you the Holy Spirit again.
[1:42:04] Not there. There is only one.
[1:42:08] Praise the name of the Lord. Isaiah saw
[1:42:10] only one seat on the
[1:42:13] John saw only one seat on the th.
[1:42:17] But you know when they read the parable
[1:42:21] they they can't come to the knowledge of
[1:42:24] the truth.
[1:42:26] And when you don't come to the knowledge
[1:42:28] of the truth,
[1:42:30] you can't know the truth.
[1:42:33] And if you don't know the truth, you are
[1:42:36] under bondage.
[1:42:38] You cannot be set free
[1:42:41] without the revelation of the mystery.
[1:42:44] So David was under the bondage of of
[1:42:47] adultery and murder.
[1:42:51] when he had a parable
[1:42:54] said that man need to be killed
[1:42:57] self righteousness
[1:43:00] and that's what is outside of the
[1:43:02] message
[1:43:04] people are selfrighteous
[1:43:07] outside of the message people are
[1:43:09] reading parables
[1:43:12] outside of the message people are
[1:43:14] listening to mysteries
[1:43:16] but then you need to hear the message of
[1:43:19] the hour
[1:43:21] and the word of God comes to the
[1:43:24] prophet. Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:43:27] That's where the revelation is given.
[1:43:30] Praise the name of our Lord. And God has
[1:43:33] been so gracious
[1:43:35] that he has opened to us the mysteries.
[1:43:39] And God was gracious
[1:43:42] that after telling David the parable,
[1:43:46] the prophet
[1:43:48] broke the seals.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[1:43:52] living in a time that the seals have
[1:43:55] been broken.
[1:43:57] So we are not reading a closed book.
[1:44:00] We are reading an open book. We know the
[1:44:03] mind of God.
[1:44:05] David with a parable. He didn't know the
[1:44:09] understanding of it. But the prophet
[1:44:11] came and broke the seals.
[1:44:15] And the prophet said in verse seven,
[1:44:19] Nathan said to David,
[1:44:22] "You are the man."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He broke the seal.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And when
[1:44:27] Nathan broke the seal,
[1:44:30] David realized his mistake. If Nathan
[1:44:33] didn't break the seal,
[1:44:35] David wouldn't have known anything. He
[1:44:38] would feel comfortable. Ah, God loves
[1:44:40] me. You know even the prophet coming to
[1:44:42] visit me,
[1:44:45] God loves me so much.
[1:44:48] The prophet visited me.
[1:44:51] But this prophet was not for eating
[1:44:54] food.
[1:44:56] Those words I had to tell the prophet
[1:44:58] the king.
[1:45:01] Now when we come to church, let us not
[1:45:03] come for saying,
[1:45:11] "Oh, you're going to overcome
[1:45:14] and you're going to be rich. You're
[1:45:17] going to heaven."
[1:45:19] Yes.
[1:45:23] Praise the name of the Lord. But a
[1:45:26] hurry.
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:31] We tell you what you want to hear.
[1:45:36] God knows the situation you're going
[1:45:37] through.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, praise the name of
[1:45:40] Lord. You need to come for fellowship.
[1:45:44] Praise the name of our Lord. You need to
[1:45:46] come.
[1:45:48] Don't come to you know don't come
[1:45:50] because you want to hear a hiring
[1:45:55] motivational speaker.
[1:45:58] The Bible says they will help to
[1:46:01] themselves teachers of itching ears.
[1:46:16] But when they have not talked about your
[1:46:18] issues,
[1:46:21] when they have not talked about your
[1:46:23] sins,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; God loves me so much.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Nathan was not a hiring.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; He was a true prophet of God
[1:46:33] and he came and told the king, you were
[1:46:36] the man.
[1:46:40] You know some people like now when David
[1:46:43] had the the parable
[1:46:46] others like now in some churches
[1:46:49] maybe would have spoken in tongue
[1:46:53] just speaking in tong
[1:46:56] but this time he said you are the man.
[1:46:59] You are the man.
[1:47:03] David humbled himself
[1:47:07] when he was told, "You are the man."
[1:47:10] When the seals were broken,
[1:47:13] when the revelation of the mystery came
[1:47:15] forth,
[1:47:17] praise the name of our Lord, David said,
[1:47:20] I was baptized in the trinity.
[1:47:23] I have to be baptized again.
[1:47:26] Praise the name of our Lord. When the
[1:47:28] mystery broke,
[1:47:30] praise the name of our Lord. And if
[1:47:32] David was a a a woman preacher
[1:47:37] and the mystery is broken,
[1:47:39] but you're not meant to be there.
[1:47:45] Me as a woman, I'm not supposed to be
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; because he has been known to you.
[1:47:50] Praise the name of our Lord. So that's
[1:47:52] why we need the revelation
[1:47:54] of the mysteries.
[1:47:56] But if you don't get the revelation of
[1:47:58] the mysteries,
[1:48:00] you remain in your iniquity,
[1:48:04] you remain there and you think
[1:48:05] everything is okay.
[1:48:07] But David humbled himself
[1:48:10] when he had the revelation of the
[1:48:13] David repented.
[1:48:15] Praise the name of our Lord. That's why
[1:48:17] we need
[1:48:19] the mystery to be open to us and the
[1:48:23] mystery has been open.
[1:48:26] Praise the name of our Lord. If he
[1:48:28] didn't catch the revelation,
[1:48:32] he would remain in his sin.
[1:48:35] But the prophet broke the seals.
[1:48:38] And David realized
[1:48:42] I'm the man. I need to change my ways.
[1:48:47] I'm the woman. I need to stop putting on
[1:48:49] men's garments.
[1:48:53] I'm the woman. I need to stop cutting
[1:48:55] off my hair.
[1:48:58] I'm the woman. I need to dress like I
[1:49:01] need to stop dressing like
[1:49:04] I'm the woman. I need to not dress like
[1:49:07] a prostitute.
[1:49:10] When the mysteries are revealed,
[1:49:13] it changes your walk.
[1:49:15] It changes your mind.
[1:49:18] I'm the man. I need to stop doing these
[1:49:21] funny things.
[1:49:23] I'm the man. I need to be stop behaving
[1:49:25] like this.
[1:49:27] Praise the name of our Lord. The mystery
[1:49:30] when it is revealed. Praise the name of
[1:49:33] our Lord. It will bring you joy and
[1:49:35] happiness
[1:49:37] and you'll be able to worship God
[1:49:40] in the spirit and in the truth.
[1:49:43] Praise the name of our Lord. And that's
[1:49:45] what God has done in our generation.
[1:49:48] He has sent us the message. The
[1:49:51] mysteries have been revealed. So once
[1:49:54] the mysteries are revealed, we need to
[1:49:56] take it
[1:49:58] as very serious as part of us. Praise
[1:50:02] the name of our Lord. So when the grace
[1:50:04] of God was revealed to David,
[1:50:08] David repented
[1:50:10] in Psalms 51.
[1:50:12] Say, "Lord, have mercy.
[1:50:15] Lord, deliver me from this sin. Deliver
[1:50:17] me from blood guiltness. deliver me from
[1:50:20] this. That is grace. Not this grace.
[1:50:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:50:27] talks about the other mystery.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You know, eternal
[1:50:33] burning hell. You'll burn for millions
[1:50:36] of years.
[1:50:40] The message says this time paragraph 259
[1:50:46] says but anything that was eternal
[1:50:50] had had never a beginning or an end
[1:50:54] and hell was created.
[1:50:57] So there is no eternal hell.
[1:51:00] Hell has a period of time
[1:51:03] and will be no more. all these
[1:51:06] mysteries.
[1:51:08] Then two 260,
[1:51:10] the mystery of the water baptism, the
[1:51:12] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:16] without sensation,
[1:51:18] but the person of Christ
[1:51:21] performing in you the same works that he
[1:51:24] did.
[1:51:26] Praise the name of our Lord. He says all
[1:51:29] the mysteries
[1:51:31] and then the mystery of the baptism of
[1:51:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:51:35] without sensation.
[1:51:38] So when you're looking for the B of the
[1:51:39] Holy Ghost,
[1:51:41] don't look for sensation.
[1:51:48] Oh brother, if you don't feel that
[1:51:51] sensation, you don't have the Holy
[1:51:52] Spirit. But I'm saying this is one of
[1:51:54] the mystery.
[1:51:58] Now are you in the message or out of the
[1:52:00] message?
[1:52:04] He said it's a mystery. And there are
[1:52:06] examples in the Bibles to this effect.
[1:52:11] Was filled with the Holy Ghost without
[1:52:14] sensation.
[1:52:17] Jesus Christ was filled with the Holy
[1:52:19] Ghost without sensation.
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:23] Now you can't take them out of the
[1:52:25] scripture.
[1:52:27] Now that does not mean you can't be
[1:52:30] filled with the Holy Ghost with
[1:52:32] sensation.
[1:52:34] But you can't put a standard
[1:52:37] that everybody filled with the Holy
[1:52:39] Ghost
[1:52:41] has to have sensation
[1:52:43] not right.
[1:52:45] Praise the name of our Lord because
[1:52:46] these are things that the Lord does
[1:52:48] himself.
[1:52:49] And brother Brandham says
[1:52:52] you can't organize Pentecost.
[1:52:58] ah the way this one got it
[1:53:01] I'm also going to get it like this
[1:53:04] brother the brother jumped up up
[1:53:07] then you start telling you you also have
[1:53:08] to jump up
[1:53:11] that's the same thing like this for
[1:53:13] telling others speak speak
[1:53:18] until you get confused and start
[1:53:19] speaking what you don't know
[1:53:22] I say now you're speaking in tongue
[1:53:25] Now you have the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:53:27] same thing. Now there's a message here I
[1:53:30] want to bring up also.
[1:53:33] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:53:35] brother Brandham says in the message the
[1:53:37] feast of the trumpets
[1:53:40] in paragraph 274
[1:53:44] in revelations 11
[1:53:47] called
[1:53:50] their ministry will be the ministry of
[1:53:52] Moses and Elias calling to Israel
[1:53:59] out of the Jewish traditions.
[1:54:07] Praise the name of our Lord. He says in
[1:54:09] Revelations 11,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I think you type their minist will be
[1:54:14] the ministry of Moses and Elias
[1:54:23] calling to Israel
[1:54:27] out of the Jewish traditions.
[1:54:36] Yeah, that's the place.
[1:54:39] Praise the name of the Lord. Paragraph
[1:54:41] 271 274.
[1:54:45] It says in Revelations 11,
[1:54:49] their ministry will be the ministry of
[1:54:51] Moses and Elias
[1:54:56] calling to Israel
[1:54:59] out of the Jewish traditions.
[1:55:04] Now that does not pertain to us.
[1:55:08] This is what pertains to us.
[1:55:11] Then he says, "Just as the seventh
[1:55:13] angel's message
[1:55:18] called the bride
[1:55:20] out of the Pentecostal tradition.
[1:55:26] We go higher than that. We go higher
[1:55:28] than emotions.
[1:55:31] We go higher than sensations.
[1:55:34] So we don't take back the traditions,
[1:55:38] the Pentecostal traditions.
[1:55:41] Oh, you have to speak in tong. Oh, you
[1:55:44] have to feel emotional to get the Holy
[1:55:45] Ghost. No, you are called out of that.
[1:55:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Remember
[1:55:52] Moses and Elijah
[1:55:55] is to call out to Israel
[1:55:58] out of the old atonement of the lamb.
[1:56:04] Because even now those people have a red
[1:56:07] hera.
[1:56:10] They saying we're waiting for the
[1:56:11] messiah but they don't know that thing
[1:56:14] is expired.
[1:56:17] So now they think they have to keep that
[1:56:19] red hers there,
[1:56:21] put security there all the time. But
[1:56:24] when Moses and Elijah come, they will
[1:56:27] point them to Christ the true son.
[1:56:30] They're not going to come and slaughter
[1:56:31] an animal.
[1:56:34] Our Lord Jesus Christ, when he came,
[1:56:38] he never offered an animal sacrifice.
[1:56:43] John the Baptist when he came he never
[1:56:46] offered an animal sacrifice.
[1:56:49] No,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; they weren't showing them that this is
[1:56:53] the way walking this way
[1:56:57] people. Oh, but we need sacrifices. We
[1:57:00] need sacrifices. They know we are out of
[1:57:04] that area now.
[1:57:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[1:57:08] says,
[1:57:12] And the seventh angel's message
[1:57:16] under the same trumpet
[1:57:18] same everything exactly
[1:57:21] the same seal
[1:57:24] is to call the people
[1:57:27] the bride
[1:57:29] out of the Pentecostals
[1:57:33] and world tradition
[1:57:36] to to the genuine atonement. Amen.
[1:57:41] The word
[1:57:43] Christ impersonated in his word here
[1:57:49] made flesh amongst us.
[1:57:53] Science has proved it by pictures.
[1:57:56] The church knows it. The world around.
[1:58:00] We firmly know it. For he's never told
[1:58:03] us one thing and thus says the Lord.
[1:58:08] But what has been the truth?
[1:58:11] Did he not set down there on the river
[1:58:16] as John the Bapt was sent to with so you
[1:58:19] will be with the message.
[1:58:23] Praise the name of our Lord. Now you see
[1:58:25] these things. So there is a calling out
[1:58:30] you know we are called to a higher level
[1:58:32] of
[1:58:35] praise the name of our Lord. Now
[1:58:38] As God has given us the message,
[1:58:41] why would you want to be a foolish
[1:58:43] virgin?
[1:58:45] Why? Why would you want to be a foolish
[1:58:48] virgin?
[1:58:49] Why do you want to have your lamp
[1:58:53] without the oil?
[1:58:56] When everything is right here before us,
[1:59:00] the oil is here fully.
[1:59:04] Why would you go home without the oil?
[1:59:07] Why do you go to place of work
[1:59:10] without your vessel,
[1:59:13] without your light burning?
[1:59:16] Why do you live at your home in darkness
[1:59:20] when there is light?
[1:59:23] Praise the name of our Lord. Why? Why
[1:59:25] would you want to leave a foolish
[1:59:27] virgin?
[1:59:31] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin.
[1:59:36] When I come to church,
[1:59:38] long dress.
[1:59:41] When I go to place of work,
[1:59:44] tight.
[1:59:46] I was supposeding you put on that dress
[1:59:49] and rapture takes place that day.
[1:59:58] Just just imagine that.
[2:00:02] And then we have artificial nails.
[2:00:06] red and green.
[2:00:09] When I when I come to church, I pluck
[2:00:12] them out.
[2:00:14] They in my small bag.
[2:00:17] Now, when I'm going to meet the social
[2:00:19] class
[2:00:21] immediately
[2:00:23] or I go to the toilet,
[2:00:28] you know, like when you're moving in a
[2:00:30] tax
[2:00:33] and some ladies you observe them
[2:00:36] before they when they know that okay,
[2:00:38] they are soon coming out,
[2:00:40] they get their hand back, they get the
[2:00:43] mirror from their hand back, try to make
[2:00:46] the hair
[2:00:48] And they have no shame.
[2:00:50] Then they get the lipstick.
[2:00:54] These days they don't need a mirror.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; But these smartphones can become a
[2:00:58] mirror.
[2:00:59] So he puts on a selfie.
[2:01:02] Then he sees herself.
[2:01:08] Now when she's coming out, the skirt is
[2:01:11] pulled up this way. Up this way.
[2:01:14] when they sit there up this way. So when
[2:01:18] she's getting up, she tries to pull it
[2:01:20] down but doesn't reach there.
[2:01:24] God
[2:01:25] supposeding that day the rapture takes
[2:01:27] place.
[2:01:30] Imagine how are you going to go to
[2:01:32] heaven
[2:01:34] with rebellion?
[2:01:37] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:01:40] Tomorrow is a deal day
[2:01:43] and because you know it's a deal and the
[2:01:45] things are not good
[2:01:49] deal
[2:01:52] you don't want even to hear anything of
[2:01:53] God
[2:01:57] yesterday I was in church
[2:02:03] I go there you don't want to read the
[2:02:05] scripture it is going to convict you of
[2:02:07] what you're going to
[2:02:11] Supposing the rapture takes place at
[2:02:13] that time,
[2:02:16] where will you be? That's a foolish
[2:02:19] virgin
[2:02:21] took things lightly.
[2:02:26] Lightly.
[2:02:29] Now in the message the seventh seal,
[2:02:33] brother Brandham says in paragraph 386
[2:02:39] 386,
[2:02:41] "Now we are into the age of the ego,
[2:02:46] the revelation to be revealed,
[2:02:49] the whole thing."
[2:02:52] Now compare this with Revelations the
[2:02:55] 10th chapter.
[2:02:58] verse one to verse 7.
[2:03:01] And we will see here in Revelations,
[2:03:04] the Revelations
[2:03:07] 10 verse one to verse 7 that in the days
[2:03:11] of the sounding of the seventh angel's
[2:03:14] message
[2:03:17] was to finish up all the mysteries of
[2:03:20] God.
[2:03:23] Now we find out also in that the sixth
[2:03:27] seal
[2:03:30] now being opened
[2:03:32] it was for a threefold purpose.
[2:03:39] You follow what I'm saying?
[2:03:42] Then he says
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; now here was the purposes.
[2:03:50] The first thing was that sleeping
[2:03:52] virgins,
[2:03:55] the sleeping virgin
[2:03:57] had to go through the tribulation period
[2:04:03] for what?
[2:04:05] Purification,
[2:04:12] rebellion is what took them through the
[2:04:14] tribulation.
[2:04:18] They never took the message seriously.
[2:04:25] Just take the portion they want.
[2:04:30] What they don't want they say that even
[2:04:33] he knows that I'm a youth. So God said,
[2:04:36] "Okay,
[2:04:38] as you've refused pure purification,
[2:04:42] as you've refused complete atonement,
[2:04:50] I'll give you three and a half years to
[2:04:51] go through the tribulation ping,
[2:04:54] tough time." So he says she had to be
[2:04:59] purged
[2:05:01] for her sins of unbelief
[2:05:05] and rejecting the message.
[2:05:09] This she was done in the tribulation
[2:05:11] period.
[2:05:14] So then you need to see that you take
[2:05:17] the message serious.
[2:05:21] Take it serious
[2:05:23] at your home. Take it serious. Live the
[2:05:27] life of Christ at your place of work.
[2:05:31] Take it serious. Live the life of
[2:05:34] Christ.
[2:05:35] Praise the name of the Lord. See that
[2:05:37] you are found worthy.
[2:05:41] See that you are found ready.
[2:05:45] Not saying
[2:05:48] you want to be too righteous.
[2:05:52] No. Take the message serious.
[2:05:56] You know, the foolish virgin never took
[2:05:59] the message serious.
[2:06:03] So God said, "Okay, I will appoint you a
[2:06:06] time of purification."
[2:06:09] And you're not in the bride.
[2:06:12] That should not be our cause.
[2:06:16] We shouldn't be focusing at that.
[2:06:20] Praise the name of the Lord. There is
[2:06:22] oil now.
[2:06:25] Receive the oil.
[2:06:27] Obey the word. That's how you receive
[2:06:29] the oil. Brother Brandham says total
[2:06:33] obedience to the word
[2:06:36] entitles you to the token.
[2:06:39] Receive the token. Why would you want to
[2:06:41] be obedient to the word
[2:06:44] and wait for a a tribulation period
[2:06:48] where they will be hunting you like a
[2:06:50] thief in the village.
[2:06:57] They used to go to church there. Receive
[2:07:00] the oil now
[2:07:03] and it's abundant.
[2:07:06] Praise the name of the Lord. Receive it.
[2:07:09] Fill your cup.
[2:07:11] Fill your vessel and let the oil keep on
[2:07:14] running over. Praise the name of the
[2:07:16] Lord. Let it run over
[2:07:19] until the Bible says you become a well
[2:07:24] and the well also gives out.
[2:07:27] When your wife abuses you, you're not
[2:07:29] going to abuse back because your well is
[2:07:32] full.
[2:07:34] Remember the message of last Sunday as
[2:07:37] pastor said a dead man
[2:07:42] even if you abused doesn't
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; because he's dead
[2:07:48] let us die the things of the world
[2:07:50] praise the name of our Lord let us die
[2:07:54] our right
[2:07:57] our privilege
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; the Bible says mortify the flesh
[2:08:09] Let it die completely. Praise the name
[2:08:12] of Lord. And maybe at home, you know,
[2:08:15] there are some families.
[2:08:18] The wife knows the husband is quiet.
[2:08:21] So she can say,
[2:08:25] "Even if I slap him, what will he do to
[2:08:27] me? You just die.
[2:08:34] just die
[2:08:40] if I don't give him food to eat.
[2:08:43] He's the one who has bought food but you
[2:08:45] don't give him
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; and then you are using those tricks to
[2:08:47] negotiate over something and you use
[2:08:56] if you don't give me this I will also
[2:08:57] not give you this.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; That's not how homes are run. deny this.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; If you refuse to give him this one,
[2:09:07] even me, I will not give you the other
[2:09:09] one.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Let the
[2:09:14] streams keep on flowing.
[2:09:18] Praise the name of the Lord. Let it keep
[2:09:20] on flowing.
[2:09:22] When somebody abuses you, you don't
[2:09:25] abuse back. When somebody fights you,
[2:09:28] you don't fight back.
[2:09:30] That shows there is a stream flowing.
[2:09:33] Praise the name of our Lord. Like our
[2:09:35] Lord Jesus Christ. When they abused him.
[2:09:39] When they beat him, praise the name of
[2:09:42] God. He said when they slap here, you
[2:09:45] turn again here.
[2:09:47] There's a flowing stream for them.
[2:09:51] That's how the Lord expects us to live.
[2:09:53] Praise the name of our Lord. A real life
[2:09:56] of Christ.
[2:09:58] Let us not be like the foolish virgin.
[2:10:02] Never cared.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Brham says she had to be
[2:10:07] purged of her sins of unbelief
[2:10:11] and rejecting the message.
[2:10:14] This she was done in the tribulation
[2:10:16] period.
[2:10:20] Then he says,
[2:10:22] then he says, you see the wind up over
[2:10:24] in Revelation 7
[2:10:29] between sixth and seventh chapter here
[2:10:33] that she had been purged
[2:10:36] and she had been given the robes.
[2:10:39] Now, she's not the bride, but it is the
[2:10:43] church,
[2:10:45] the pure people
[2:10:47] that didn't have the opportunity
[2:10:50] maybe to receive the message
[2:10:53] or in some way that were blinded by this
[2:10:57] false prophet.
[2:11:00] They didn't get a chance.
[2:11:03] They yet they really sincere in their
[2:11:05] heart
[2:11:08] and God knows their heart
[2:11:10] and here they are purged during this
[2:11:13] time.
[2:11:15] Now God has been gracious to us that we
[2:11:20] have received the message.
[2:11:22] Let us not be like the other people
[2:11:26] who are deceived by the false prophets
[2:11:29] who reject the message
[2:11:32] because they hear false prophet
[2:11:35] and so they miss the rapture.
[2:11:38] They miss being part of the bride.
[2:11:41] Praise the name of the Lord. But here we
[2:11:43] have received the message.
[2:11:45] And it is the message,
[2:11:48] the revelation of the mysteries
[2:11:51] that catches the bride. But the didn't
[2:11:54] have opportunity to hear the message.
[2:11:57] Praise the name of our lord. So then for
[2:12:00] them when they come to realization that
[2:12:02] they telling them to worship a beast or
[2:12:04] the image of the beast,
[2:12:08] they say no no I'm not.
[2:12:10] You go through the tribulation. But then
[2:12:12] for us we've had opportunity that we
[2:12:16] receive the message. Let us receive the
[2:12:19] whole message.
[2:12:21] Let us obey the whole message.
[2:12:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Even where
[2:12:26] you find you are failing.
[2:12:28] Say Lord help me. Give me grace to
[2:12:31] overcome distress. Give me grace to
[2:12:33] overcome this temptation. Give me grace
[2:12:35] to overcome this trial. You can say Lord
[2:12:38] I need you
[2:12:40] like Samson. God once more.
[2:12:44] Praise the name of our Lord. Yeah, we
[2:12:47] shouldn't be the foolish virgin.
[2:12:50] Praise the name of our Lord. Then he
[2:12:51] says, and notice that another pinging
[2:12:55] time
[2:12:57] that is for Israel when she gathers.
[2:13:02] That's the second fold.
[2:13:09] God pes Israel in tribulation period.
[2:13:14] Out of the millions that will gather
[2:13:15] there,
[2:13:17] there will be selected 144,000
[2:13:25] that will be purged also.
[2:13:29] Now he says the sixth seal
[2:13:32] has three-fold purpose.
[2:13:35] The first thing because it's under the
[2:13:38] the last three and a half years
[2:13:43] after the rapture. The first purpose is
[2:13:47] to purge the foolish virgin.
[2:13:52] The second purpose is to purge the
[2:13:55] 144,000
[2:13:59] of the Jews. The third purpose is to
[2:14:02] purge the earth
[2:14:04] where the sun will stop shining.
[2:14:07] It will stop raining
[2:14:09] a lot of untold suffering on earth.
[2:14:13] You don't need to wait to see those
[2:14:15] things to obey the word of God. Praise
[2:14:19] the name of our Lord. Now in another
[2:14:21] message
[2:14:22] questions and answers
[2:14:24] he says
[2:14:27] now and then at that time
[2:14:32] see the gentile bride
[2:14:36] you type this.
[2:14:38] Okay. Yeah it's okay. You've got it. The
[2:14:41] gentle bride
[2:14:43] is in heaven
[2:14:47] and the sleeping virgin.
[2:14:51] The gentile virgin
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] is not to be saved during that time.
[2:14:59] She's already been saved
[2:15:02] but has been rejected
[2:15:06] in the bride.
[2:15:08] Why?
[2:15:10] Then he says, "And she only go through
[2:15:12] the tribulation period
[2:15:17] for the time of purification
[2:15:21] because she has rejected Christ
[2:15:26] the word
[2:15:28] for her purification.
[2:15:33] Then she has to suffer for her deeds.
[2:15:42] not taking the whole word of God with
[2:15:44] your life.
[2:15:48] No one is seeing
[2:15:51] what
[2:15:55] you need to entertain yourself.
[2:15:58] And then brotherham says
[2:16:01] she suffers for her deeds,
[2:16:06] but the bride
[2:16:08] who has become the word.
[2:16:12] A complete atonement was made of Christ
[2:16:18] because he is the word.
[2:16:21] That body was rendered.
[2:16:25] And when the body was rendered,
[2:16:28] the bride was in that body
[2:16:32] because it is all the work.
[2:16:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:16:38] When Christ suffered,
[2:16:40] why do you want to go through the
[2:16:41] tribulation period?
[2:16:43] Why don't you be part of the bride and
[2:16:46] then you want to be under the foolish?
[2:16:49] We have complete atonement now,
[2:16:52] the word of God. Take it in its
[2:16:55] fullness.
[2:16:56] It makes you to be the bride of Jesus
[2:16:58] Christ.
[2:17:02] I will just take what I want. You're
[2:17:05] putting yourself out.
[2:17:08] That should not be our decision.
[2:17:13] Praise the name of the Lord. Receive
[2:17:15] complete atonement.
[2:17:18] And the complete atonement
[2:17:21] is in the message of the hour.
[2:17:25] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[2:17:27] another message still questions and
[2:17:29] answers
[2:17:31] he says now just a minute
[2:17:35] will the foolish virgin be saved
[2:17:39] he says whatever happens
[2:17:43] happens now
[2:17:45] after the time she's in the state
[2:17:50] now she will have to go through the
[2:17:53] tribulation period
[2:17:57] And the reason of it is
[2:18:01] is because she rejected
[2:18:04] the atonement
[2:18:06] in its fullness.
[2:18:10] And what's the atonement? It fullness
[2:18:13] the message of the hour.
[2:18:16] Take it full in your life.
[2:18:19] So you are receiving atonement
[2:18:22] in its fullness.
[2:18:25] You're not partial. Let me take this.
[2:18:28] Leave this. But the whole message is so
[2:18:31] dear to you.
[2:18:35] So then you are taking the whole
[2:18:37] atonement
[2:18:39] in its fullness.
[2:18:41] At your place of work, you are fully
[2:18:44] atoned.
[2:18:46] At your home, you are fully atoned. You
[2:18:50] are in the midst of strangers.
[2:18:52] You are fully atoned.
[2:18:54] Not have atoned
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; but you behave like them.
[2:19:02] Oh,
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. Full
[2:19:05] atonement
[2:19:08] in its fullness.
[2:19:10] He says she is a believer, a professed
[2:19:13] believer,
[2:19:16] but she will have to go through the
[2:19:17] tribulation period.
[2:19:21] because she never took the whole thing.
[2:19:24] The Bible say all the rest of them the
[2:19:28] dragon sparted water out of his mouth
[2:19:35] to go and make war.
[2:19:38] What an hour that is.
[2:19:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Let us not
[2:19:43] be the foolish virgin.
[2:19:46] Let us get the full atonement.
[2:19:49] What the message tells you, do take it
[2:19:52] with all your heart.
[2:19:54] It is for your good.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. It is for
[2:19:59] our good.
[2:20:01] Praise the name of our Lord. Now, let me
[2:20:03] see how we can conclude.
[2:20:06] Praise the name of our Lord. Let us go
[2:20:09] to the first se.
[2:20:11] Notice I love this. other reformers,
[2:20:18] but by being great men of God,
[2:20:23] seeing the need of the day
[2:20:27] and brought forth reformation.
[2:20:31] But Revelations 10
[2:20:34] said his message
[2:20:43] was to reveal not to reform.
[2:20:48] Reveal the secrets.
[2:20:51] Reveal the secrets.
[2:20:53] It is the word in the man.
[2:20:57] Hebrews 4:8 said, "The word of God is
[2:21:00] sharper than a two-edged sword,
[2:21:03] piercing,
[2:21:05] even to the sand of born
[2:21:08] and a revealer of the secrets of the
[2:21:10] earth.
[2:21:13] This man is not a reformer.
[2:21:16] He is a revealer,
[2:21:18] a revealer of what? The mysteries of
[2:21:22] God.
[2:21:24] Where the church has got it all tied up
[2:21:29] and everything
[2:21:32] is to come forth.
[2:21:34] where the church has got it all tied up
[2:21:36] and everything
[2:21:40] is to come forth with the word,
[2:21:42] the word of God and reveal the thing out
[2:21:47] because he is to restore the faith of
[2:21:50] the children
[2:21:53] back to the fathers.
[2:21:55] The original Bible faith
[2:21:59] is to be restored by the seventh angel.
[2:22:04] Praise the name of our Lord. So we
[2:22:06] receive the message and the message
[2:22:09] restores us back
[2:22:12] to the faith of the apostles.
[2:22:16] It takes us back to the original.
[2:22:20] The message of the hour and the message
[2:22:22] of the hour reveals the mysteries.
[2:22:27] And it is these mysteries
[2:22:29] that catches the bride.
[2:22:32] Praise the name of the Lord. So you
[2:22:34] shouldn't be afraid
[2:22:36] to testify
[2:22:38] what the Lord has done. Talk to your
[2:22:41] friends. Talk to your colleagues. Talk
[2:22:45] to your neighbors. Talk to your family.
[2:22:48] Talk with that confidence.
[2:22:51] God has given us a message.
[2:22:53] We have a message preparing us for the
[2:22:56] rapture.
[2:22:58] Praise the name of our Lord. But
[2:23:00] adventure
[2:23:01] as you talk the mystery you are talking
[2:23:05] will catch the bride
[2:23:08] and then say no. This is what I've been
[2:23:11] looking for.
[2:23:14] This is the truth. Praise the name of
[2:23:16] our Lord.
[2:23:18] This is the truth.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; And when you've got the truth, you'll
[2:23:22] not sit back.
[2:23:23] You'll be like the other man who found a
[2:23:27] treasure in a land.
[2:23:30] He went back and sold all that he had
[2:23:34] to go and purchase that possession.
[2:23:37] You'll not sit home.
[2:23:43] You live in
[2:23:45] saying you don't have transport.
[2:23:49] We are here.
[2:23:52] They didn't have transport.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Did you catch the mystery?
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of Lord. Did you catch
[2:23:59] the mystery? Really?
[2:24:01] And it is not saying I shouldn't miss
[2:24:03] church.
[2:24:08] You be
[2:24:12] I fa to get.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Did you catch the mystery?
[2:24:19] Oh, you live here.
[2:24:27] The situation was not so good. I didn't
[2:24:32] excuse of not failing to come to church.
[2:24:37] Praise the name of our Lord. Did you
[2:24:39] catch the mystery?
[2:24:42] Because it is so precious.
[2:24:45] I don't want to miss any single thing. I
[2:24:48] want to be in church early now.
[2:24:52] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:24:54] somebody who comes from
[2:24:58] comes earlier than you at church. But
[2:25:01] for you comes close.
[2:25:06] I reach when the preacher is preaching
[2:25:08] and then you start looking around when
[2:25:10] you reach
[2:25:13] your heart is not settled.
[2:25:16] By the time you settle
[2:25:18] the things to make you enter in,
[2:25:22] they have already gone.
[2:25:24] Then you start
[2:25:26] the same spirits that troubled you when
[2:25:28] you are coming.
[2:25:30] They are still sitting on you. By the
[2:25:33] time of the end of the service, you've
[2:25:36] got other spirits
[2:25:44] in the other one.
[2:25:47] I don't even enjoy that church anymore.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Did you catch the mystery?
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. You know,
[2:25:54] you need to find out because it's a
[2:25:57] personal relationship
[2:26:00] is that when we come to church, we come
[2:26:03] into fellowship
[2:26:06] like pastor was preaching last Sunday.
[2:26:09] When the other the man was healed of
[2:26:12] leprosy,
[2:26:14] he came back for fellowship.
[2:26:17] Praise the name of the Lord. You You
[2:26:19] long for fellowship.
[2:26:21] I was glad when they said unto me, let
[2:26:24] us go into the house.
[2:26:26] There's something I'm going to learn of.
[2:26:30] Praise the name of our Lord. like David.
[2:26:33] What an opportunity he had
[2:26:35] when the prophet came to help him out of
[2:26:40] his leprosy.
[2:26:42] Much as he didn't know that he had
[2:26:44] leprosy
[2:26:46] over adultery, lepros of murder. When
[2:26:49] the prophet came,
[2:26:52] God told him,
[2:26:54] "This is your problem.
[2:26:57] If you will do well
[2:26:59] like
[2:27:02] when he was praying and praying
[2:27:05] maybe that's all the best he knew how to
[2:27:07] do it and then God sent an angel and
[2:27:10] then the angel told him if you're going
[2:27:13] to do well
[2:27:16] go and send for Peter
[2:27:19] see how that fellowship
[2:27:22] when God sends a minister in our midst
[2:27:26] how we need to desire
[2:27:28] Lord what will you speak to me today
[2:27:31] It may help you overcome your stression.
[2:27:35] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[2:27:37] when Peter came,
[2:27:39] Cornelius
[2:27:41] went to a higher level.
[2:27:44] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[2:27:46] always be our desire. Lord, I'm coming
[2:27:48] into your service. Lord, speak to my
[2:27:51] heart. Lord, this is my weakness. Lord,
[2:27:54] this is my failure. Lord, I need to be
[2:27:56] helped in this area. Lord, I'm confused
[2:27:59] in this kind of man.
[2:28:01] Like Isaiah, praise the name of our
[2:28:03] Lord. When he came into the interface
[2:28:05] with God
[2:28:07] and then he saw the glory of the
[2:28:09] saraphim
[2:28:11] and then it came to his mind. Oh, I'm a
[2:28:14] man of unclean lips.
[2:28:17] Lord, I'm done.
[2:28:20] And then said, Lord, I need to be
[2:28:22] delivered. The same thing with us. When
[2:28:25] we come into the presence of God, the
[2:28:28] blood of Jesus Christ is here
[2:28:31] to make us whole
[2:28:33] of any uncleanness.
[2:28:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[2:28:37] reach out and get the blood. Lord wash
[2:28:41] me here. Lord cleans me here. The full
[2:28:44] atonement is here.
[2:28:47] Maybe there is a weakness here. Maybe
[2:28:49] there is a failure here. Lord, this is
[2:28:52] my opportunity.
[2:28:54] Praise the name of our Lord. So you
[2:28:56] receive it
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; and be like Joshua the high priest.
[2:29:02] He was dressed on with filthy garment
[2:29:07] and then he stood before the angel of
[2:29:08] the Lord. But also Satan was resisting
[2:29:11] him.
[2:29:13] That could be your same condition.
[2:29:16] Regardless of how much Satan has
[2:29:18] resisted you,
[2:29:20] fighting you, offending you, pulling you
[2:29:25] back, just stand before the presence of
[2:29:28] God. Praise the name of our Lord and
[2:29:31] allow God himself
[2:29:33] to take your condition out.
[2:29:36] Praise the name of our Lord. And don't
[2:29:38] have excuses
[2:29:41] where you fail to come to church.
[2:29:44] see that you come to church.
[2:29:46] There is no a flowing fountain
[2:29:50] and be participating in the services of
[2:29:52] the Lord.
[2:29:54] When you come in time, you are part of
[2:29:56] the song. You are singing with joy in
[2:29:59] your heart. You are part of the Sunday
[2:30:01] school. You are hearing the instructions
[2:30:04] of God.
[2:30:05] You are part of every activity.
[2:30:08] But you have not said ah may I will come
[2:30:12] in the middle or I'll come towards the
[2:30:14] end. The whole menu is for us.
[2:30:19] Praise the name of our lord. Take the
[2:30:21] whole course.
[2:30:23] Praise the name of our lord. And you
[2:30:25] know when you are eating
[2:30:27] there are some things which are sweet.
[2:30:30] There are some things which are bitter.
[2:30:32] There are some things which don't have
[2:30:34] taste.
[2:30:36] Then there are some things again they
[2:30:38] can even you know make your eyes start
[2:30:41] you know shedding tears
[2:30:45] like onions.
[2:30:48] You know when you keep them closed to
[2:30:49] your eyes you can start shedding tears
[2:30:51] but yet you need the onions.
[2:30:55] You need them sometimes you need to make
[2:30:58] you sweat.
[2:31:02] You need it. If you don't it may not be
[2:31:04] healthy for you.
[2:31:07] So take the whole menu.
[2:31:10] Don't only take don't only remove this
[2:31:12] sweet part.
[2:31:21] No eat them. And sometimes the bitter
[2:31:24] things
[2:31:27] are the ones which revive your life.
[2:31:32] Ah,
[2:31:36] you eat it,
[2:31:38] it just revives you. Those grains
[2:31:41] purifies the body. They p it.
[2:31:46] But when you eat meat, it can make you
[2:31:48] become fat,
[2:31:52] block the blood vessels.
[2:31:55] Eat some of those bitter things to
[2:31:57] cleanse the blood vessels
[2:32:00] that the life of Christ can flow through
[2:32:01] you.
[2:32:03] Praise the name of our Lord. So you come
[2:32:05] and eat the whole cause.
[2:32:13] They are very good. Praise the name of
[2:32:16] our Lord. So we have a message God has
[2:32:19] given unto us.
[2:32:21] Let us take the whole of it.
[2:32:24] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[2:32:26] Ludician church age,
[2:32:30] page 327,
[2:32:34] he says, "Now the messenger of Malachi 4
[2:32:38] and Revelations 10:7
[2:32:42] is going to do two things.
[2:32:45] One thing according to Malachi 4, he
[2:32:48] will turn the hearts of the children
[2:32:52] to the fathers.
[2:32:54] Two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[2:32:57] seven thunders
[2:33:00] in revelation 10
[2:33:03] which are the revelations contained in
[2:33:05] the seven seals.
[2:33:08] It will be this divinely revealed
[2:33:10] mystery truth
[2:33:12] that will turn the hearts of the
[2:33:15] children
[2:33:17] to the Pentecostal fathers.
[2:33:20] And when you go and take this truth to
[2:33:23] the denominational world,
[2:33:27] they are so bitter for them to accept.
[2:33:31] But to us, it is life. Praise the name
[2:33:35] of our Lord. It is life eternal.
[2:33:39] So see that you hold the message with
[2:33:42] all your heart.
[2:33:44] Receive atonement in its fullness.
[2:33:48] Let Christ be made known to you fully.
[2:33:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Have the
[2:33:55] life of Christ living in you.
[2:33:58] And walk in the light.
[2:34:01] Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[2:34:03] living in a day where the rapture has to
[2:34:06] take place.
[2:34:08] But how will it find you?
[2:34:11] Will it find you with halfdressed
[2:34:12] garment?
[2:34:16] Be washed in the blood of Jesus.
[2:34:19] Be made whole.
[2:34:22] Be made clean.
[2:34:24] Like Revelations 19,
[2:34:27] the bride has made herself ready.
[2:34:31] Are you ready?
[2:34:33] We have the garment here avail.
[2:34:43] So the mystery catches the bride. Use
[2:34:47] that mystery what God has revealed to
[2:34:50] you and testify.
[2:34:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Testify to
[2:34:56] others.
[2:34:58] Some of these people they said they are
[2:34:59] saved
[2:35:01] but they have never been baptized.
[2:35:04] Tell them about the importance of
[2:35:07] some say they are saved but they behave
[2:35:10] like the rest of them. Tell them the
[2:35:12] importance.
[2:35:14] Show them the scriptures.
[2:35:16] Tell them about this message.
[2:35:19] Then you will catch the bride of Christ.
[2:35:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Are we
[2:35:23] going to do that?
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. May God bless you.
[2:35:28] Amen. Amen.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; There's a song which says, "What a day
[2:35:38] that will be." Praise the name of our
[2:35:40] Lord. We can stand up and sing that song
[2:35:42] together.
[2:35:49] Song 204.
[2:35:55] Amen. As the song leader comes
[2:35:58] We have only one service today.
[2:36:01] But on Saturday, we have praying and
[2:36:03] fasting.
[2:36:05] Then on Sunday, we have a youth meeting
[2:36:07] in the afternoon.
[2:36:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:36:14] There is coming
[2:36:17] a day
[2:36:19] when no heartaches
[2:36:23] shall come.
[2:36:25] No more clouds
[2:36:28] in the sky.
[2:36:31] No more tears
[2:36:34] to dim the heart.
[2:36:37] All is peace
[2:36:40] forever more.
[2:36:43] on that happy
[2:36:47] golden day.
[2:36:50] What a day,
[2:36:53] glorious day
[2:36:56] that will be.
[2:37:00] [Music]
[2:37:02] What a day
[2:37:05] that to me
[2:37:08] when my Jesus
[2:37:11] I shall see
[2:37:15] and I look
[2:37:17] upon his face.
[2:37:21] One who saved
[2:37:24] me my grace
[2:37:27] when he takes
[2:37:30] me by the hand
[2:37:33] and leads me through
[2:37:37] the promised land.
[2:37:40] What a day
[2:37:44] glorious day that to be.
[2:37:49] There will be no sorrows.
[2:37:53] There will be no
[2:37:57] sorrow there.
[2:38:00] No more bendance
[2:38:04] to be.
[2:38:06] No more sickness,
[2:38:10] no pain,
[2:38:13] no more bing
[2:38:16] over there.
[2:38:20] and forever
[2:38:23] will be
[2:38:26] with the one who died
[2:38:29] for me.
[2:38:33] What a day,
[2:38:36] glorious day that will be.
[2:38:42] What a day.
[2:38:45] [Music]
[2:38:46] one
[2:38:48] [Music]
[2:38:49] to be
[2:38:52] [Music]
[2:38:59] and I look
[2:39:02] upon his face.
[2:39:05] The one who saved
[2:39:08] me by his grace.
[2:39:12] And he takes
[2:39:15] me by
[2:39:18] and leads me through
[2:39:21] the promised land.
[2:39:25] What a day.
[2:39:28] Glorious day
[2:39:31] that you be.
[2:39:35] What a day.
[2:39:38] to be
[2:39:41] that will be
[2:39:44] when my Jesus
[2:39:48] I shall see.
[2:39:51] And I look
[2:39:54] upon his face.
