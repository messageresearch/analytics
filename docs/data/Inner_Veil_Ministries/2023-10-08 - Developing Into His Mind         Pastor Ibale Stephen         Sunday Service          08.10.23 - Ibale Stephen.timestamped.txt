[3:31] give them the victory they
[3:33] need in Jesus
[3:35] name
[3:37] [Music]
[3:41] amen so I welcome you to the service
[3:44] this
[3:46] morning amen let's just turn to the book
[3:49] of Ephesians chapter
[3:53] 1 amen my wife is not
[3:57] here yeah we got some bit of
[4:02] flu and her condition is not
[4:07] good but the Lord is
[4:10] gracious as I've always
[4:12] said pastors never get
[4:16] sick they always at their post of
[4:20] Duty amen let's turn to Ephesians
[4:23] chapter
[4:25] one
[4:27] verse according as he has chosen Us in
[4:30] him before the foundation of the
[4:33] world that we should be holy and Without
[4:37] Blame
[4:50] in may the Lord bless the reading of his
[4:54] word you may be
[4:56] seated so when we Mak a decision for
[5:01] Christ when one makes a decision for
[5:05] Christ there are certain areas of
[5:09] scripture that should be deeply pondered
[5:14] on so the scriptures help us to discover
[5:18] the
[5:21] potentials that
[5:23] goded in our favor to
[5:27] overcome amen we come to discover that a
[5:31] true
[5:33] decision will always overcome the
[5:36] weakness of the
[5:38] flesh amen so when God created
[5:42] Adam he knew that Adam would
[5:46] fall but then he predetermined that the
[5:50] devil would never hold him
[5:55] permanently God knew very
[5:58] well what Satan was going to
[6:01] do but then he made a
[6:05] decision that Satan would not have Adam
[6:11] permanently by the
[6:13] Fall the fall amen God proved his more
[6:18] than
[6:20] able to pick up his children that are
[6:23] trapped in
[6:26] sin so your weakness today
[6:30] does not Mark the end of your
[6:34] journey you know
[6:36] because you know God himself could not
[6:40] let
[6:42] Adam permanently in the hands of
[6:46] EV so in the
[6:49] process of extending grace to
[6:54] you God has laid certain resue plans
[7:02] he knew that when he picks you
[7:05] up that he would Jus
[7:08] you that would sanctify you and also
[7:12] baptize with the Holy
[7:15] Ghost that's how God does rest to
[7:19] us he so much cares about
[7:23] you that when you
[7:25] stray he already put some rescue plan
[7:28] for you
[7:32] again that he will leave the
[7:36] 99 and look for a repentant
[7:40] sin amen so one thing you need to
[7:45] assertain is that your
[7:49] repentance was
[7:52] genuine to the
[7:54] best of your
[7:58] understanding that's that's the only
[7:59] thing you needed to
[8:01] do that you are in
[8:05] church you are in the
[8:07] word because you feel that you are the
[8:10] genuine
[8:13] repentance amen because he
[8:16] says of those which you gave
[8:19] me I'll lose
[8:22] none if your repentance was
[8:26] genuine God can never lose you
[8:30] amen you can only come to genuine
[8:34] repentance because you are a part
[8:43] of are you here together with me that's
[8:47] the only way you can have a perfect
[8:53] repentance something from the bottom of
[8:55] your
[8:57] heart because he knew
[8:59] you from before the foundation of the
[9:03] world he knows you and because he knew
[9:07] you he had a great
[9:11] plan like Jeremiah 2911
[9:17] says
[9:19] [Music]
[9:20] 2911 he says for I know the thoughts
[9:23] that I think towards you says the Lord
[9:27] thoughts of peace are not evil to give
[9:31] you
[9:33] unexpected
[9:51] end expects you to end in a certain
[9:56] way so God has never really thought evil
[10:01] about those who before
[10:05] knew because he is faithful to
[10:11] himself that's why he swears by
[10:15] himself he swears by
[10:19] himself praise the Lord you see in
[10:23] Hebrews 6
[10:25] verse2 before we get into this I mean
[10:28] the scripture are going to deal
[10:31] with he says here that he be not
[10:36] slothful but followers of them who
[10:39] through faith and patience
[10:43] inherit the
[10:58] promises
[11:10] he says be not
[11:14] slothful but followers of
[11:18] them who through faith and patience
[11:21] inhal the
[11:24] promises he's talking about the cloud of
[11:27] witnesses
[11:30] which is in Hebrews
[11:32] [Music]
[11:33] 11 by faith
[11:36] Abraham by faith
[11:38] sah by faith Enoch by faith Moses he
[11:43] says
[11:44] those through faith and
[11:48] patience they inherit the
[11:52] promises so faith and patience go
[11:54] [Music]
[11:56] together in the believer's Walk In
[12:01] Christ knowing this that the trying of
[12:05] your
[12:07] faith
[12:10] work amen
[12:12] verse3 for when God made promise to
[12:18] Abraham because he could swear by no
[12:23] greater he SW by
[12:26] himself Hallelujah do you understand
[12:30] that I'm telling you that
[12:34] God is faithful to
[12:38] himself amen because in
[12:42] swearing you look for somebody
[12:46] greater you get
[12:49] somebody who is greater and you swear
[12:53] by in writing an
[12:56] O amen you go before a lawyer or a judge
[13:00] or a
[13:03] magistrate but God looked at all of
[13:07] them and he was greater than them
[13:10] all and so he SW by
[13:15] himself amen saying blessing I bless
[13:20] thee and multiplying i
[13:24] m and so after he had patiently
[13:27] ended
[13:29] he obtained the
[13:31] promise to Men veryy by the
[13:36] greater and an for
[13:40] confirmation is to them an end of all
[13:45] Strife so an
[13:47] O dissolves all
[13:52] [Music]
[13:53] disputations amen was SW before one who
[13:57] is greater
[14:00] but God could not find any greater than
[14:04] himself any who has more
[14:07] faithful so verse
[14:10] 17 where in God willing more abundant to
[14:14] show unto the ha of Promise the
[14:18] immutability of his castle confirmed by
[14:27] no
[14:38] amen so
[14:40] God was willing to show that he has a
[14:46] promise the immutability of his
[14:51] C so he says I'm going to make a
[14:55] oath and I'm going to Ser it by myself
[15:01] I want you to get that
[15:04] image before we sink into
[15:10] Ephesians go
[15:13] SW
[15:16] all that you are going to be
[15:21] there and it doesn't
[15:25] fail amen he says here
[15:32] this thing says the
[15:34] amen I like that it means that whatever
[15:39] he said is
[15:42] final it means that whatever he say to
[15:45] the first
[15:48] age and to the second
[15:50] age and to all
[15:52] ages about his own true
[15:56] church and about the false vibe
[16:00] is exactly
[16:02] right and it won't
[16:04] change it means that what he started
[16:08] out within
[16:12] Genesis he will finish in
[16:15] Revelation he has to for is the amen so
[16:19] let it
[16:22] be he comes to the next
[16:25] paragraph This things says the faithful
[16:28] and true
[16:31] witness now I want to show
[16:33] you what I find in thought of
[16:38] faithful you know we often talk about a
[16:41] great and changing
[16:45] God whose word does not
[16:49] change and when we speak of him after
[16:53] that
[16:54] manner we often get a
[16:57] view of of him that makes him seem very
[17:06] [Music]
[17:08] impersonal it
[17:10] is as though God made the world
[17:15] universe and the laws that pertain to
[17:18] it and then stood
[17:21] back and became a personal
[17:27] God amen because he has written
[17:31] everything he has said everything in
[17:34] order like he just locked himself in the
[17:37] back and he doesn't
[17:40] care that's how people think about
[17:43] God it's as though God made a way of
[17:48] salvation for lost
[17:50] mankind that we being the
[17:53] cross and then we when the death of
[17:58] Christ has atoned for our
[18:02] sins and his resurrection gave us an
[18:05] open door to
[18:09] him God folded his
[18:12] arms and stood
[18:14] back that's what people
[18:21] think so it's up to
[18:24] you you walk in it or you were lost
[18:29] that's what people
[18:31] think but brother Bram is
[18:34] saying God is Not imp
[18:39] personal amen it's as if we imagine
[18:43] believing in a great
[18:46] Creator who having
[18:49] created lost personal interest in his
[18:53] creation Now I said that is how too many
[18:56] people are able to think
[19:00] but that's ra
[19:04] thinking amen for God is governing in
[19:07] the Affairs of
[19:10] men right now he both Creator and
[19:17] sustainer Hallelujah hu he's a person of
[19:21] God he cares about how you woke up this
[19:26] morning he cares when you don't have
[19:29] something to
[19:31] eat he cares when you have got a loan to
[19:35] pay he cares when you have family
[19:39] troubles he's a personal
[19:43] God he cares what you
[19:46] eat are you together with me yeah we
[19:49] don't serve any personal
[19:53] God he's your personal
[19:56] God he cares for you
[19:59] and every
[20:04] El after the finishing
[20:08] life he's not going to give you
[20:12] up he cares when you're driving your
[20:16] car he cares when you are crossing the
[20:19] road we serve a personal
[20:25] God he cares when you go to
[20:29] bed he cares when you wake
[20:34] up we
[20:36] serve God who cares for his
[20:40] children amen so Colossians chapter
[20:45] one and verse
[20:48] 16 he says for by him were all things
[20:52] [Music]
[20:54] created that in heaven and that in Earth
[20:58] visible and invisible whether they be
[21:01] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[21:05] all powers all things were created by
[21:08] Him and for
[21:27] him
[21:37] for are you together with me if you are
[21:41] a son of
[21:43] God God created
[21:47] you but if you are not a child of
[21:50] God you are a biological
[21:56] product just a of your father and
[22:00] mother and then you are
[22:02] given a human
[22:04] Spirit to lead your
[22:07] flesh but if you are a child of God you
[22:11] came from the mind of
[22:14] God and if you come from the mind of
[22:17] God all things were created by
[22:21] Him and for
[22:26] him he's a person of
[22:28] God and is before all
[22:31] things and by him all things
[22:35] consist and is before all
[22:38] things and by him all things
[22:45] consist if you are a child of
[22:49] God from the bottom of your heart you
[22:53] are because he
[22:56] is
[22:59] he says
[23:00] here back in church
[23:02] book he is a sovereign
[23:06] God by his own
[23:08] castle he purposed The Plan of Salvation
[23:11] of his own
[23:15] elect for which he he for
[23:18] knew the son died upon the
[23:22] cross to establish the means of
[23:26] Salvation and the Holy
[23:29] Spirit executes the will of the
[23:33] father he working all
[23:36] things at this moment according to the
[23:40] purpose of his own
[23:43] will he's right in the midst of it
[23:47] all he's in the midst of his
[23:51] church this great
[23:53] Creator savior
[23:55] God is Faithfully working among his own
[23:59] right
[24:02] now as the great Shepherd of the
[24:06] sheep his very
[24:08] existence is for his
[24:11] own he loves them and cares for them His
[24:16] Eye Is Never upon them he's talking to
[24:21] you he cares for
[24:24] you when the word says that your lives
[24:28] are HID with Christ and
[24:32] God it means exactly what it
[24:36] says so today your life is hidden in
[24:42] Christ in
[24:47] God those are powerful
[24:51] statements amen hallelujah hallelujah
[24:55] yes sir I am so so glad that my God
[24:59] abides
[25:04] faithful he true to
[25:09] himself he true to
[25:12] himself he want lie he's true to the
[25:17] word he will back it
[25:20] up he true to
[25:22] us he will lose none of
[25:26] us us up in the last
[25:30] day I am glad I am resting in his
[25:38] faithfulness are you resting in his
[25:42] faithfulness so there are many
[25:45] scriptures to
[25:47] ponder about the love of God for
[25:51] us that eternal
[25:56] love he didn't love me
[26:00] yesterday and hatte me
[26:04] today he made a
[26:08] plan and by that
[26:10] plan every one of us will
[26:15] overcome
[26:18] everyone everyone who made a faithful
[26:24] confession that Lord forgive my sin
[26:29] he'll
[26:32] overcome he lose
[26:35] none Philippians 1:6
[26:39] says being confident of this very
[26:44] thing that he which has begun a good
[26:47] work in
[26:49] you will perform it to the day of the
[26:51] Lord Jesus
[26:54] Christ many scriptures to P
[26:59] about on the love of
[27:02] God he has for
[27:05] you but the devil wakes up in the
[27:09] morning to tell you you won't
[27:12] overcome you won't make it he's
[27:18] negative and he always puts that poison
[27:21] in your
[27:24] mind but God has spoken to you this
[27:26] morning
[27:28] that he
[27:29] rules he
[27:32] rules in the Affairs of
[27:35] men amen so I
[27:39] want to speak on the
[27:42] subject Dev his
[27:48] [Music]
[27:51] mind now Ephesians
[27:55] 1:4 according as he has chosen Us in
[27:59] him before the foundation of the
[28:02] world he did choose you when you came to
[28:05] the
[28:06] altar you came to the
[28:09] altar because he knew you from before
[28:12] the foundation of the
[28:14] world and now that you should be
[28:21] holy and Without
[28:24] Blame before him in
[28:26] love
[28:28] he chose you before the
[28:31] foundation so that you can be
[28:34] holy and Without
[28:37] Blame chosen in him by
[28:42] election to be
[28:44] holy Without
[28:47] Blame then the devil will tell you look
[28:51] at what you
[28:53] are can that apply to
[28:56] you
[29:00] and then he will tell you you are not
[29:03] the
[29:04] one but if you made a genuine
[29:09] repentance he has made a way to bring
[29:13] you to what he thought about
[29:17] you he knew you as
[29:21] holy and Without
[29:23] Blame and we are growing into that
[29:28] amen so there is a way God knew
[29:32] us that we have never broken into
[29:36] yet therefore the
[29:38] bride is the developing
[29:42] Revelation amen you are a deving
[29:49] revelation because you've been a
[29:51] mystery and the world knew you as
[29:55] evil Wicked
[29:59] filthy
[30:01] undesirable but day after day you are
[30:04] growing from
[30:06] glory to glory there was the glory of
[30:11] justification God
[30:12] Justified you are coming through the
[30:15] glory of
[30:17] sanctification on every daily
[30:20] basis when you sit before the
[30:23] word you go out more glorified that when
[30:27] you came in is that amen so God is
[30:32] working you
[30:35] upward amen and this growth is a
[30:40] mystery that like Christ said about the
[30:43] seed in the
[30:45] ground you put the seed in the
[30:48] ground you go
[30:50] sleep and wake up you can never know
[30:55] that the seed has grown but all of a
[30:58] sudden you see it brings up a
[31:02] blade amen and then you see it brings up
[31:07] the you know the
[31:11] ear and then the food in the
[31:16] a so the seed keeps
[31:19] growing but then you cannot know
[31:23] how that's how also we are
[31:26] growing we are the seed of God planted
[31:30] in the good ground of our
[31:33] hearts so our way of
[31:35] grow is what I'm calling a developing
[31:40] Revelation amen which I'm calling a a
[31:44] developing
[31:46] Revelation and this growth is divinely
[31:50] managed by God
[31:54] himself as we submit to the
[31:58] word so God knew
[32:01] us at a level that is still a mystery to
[32:07] us meaning that we shall come to a
[32:11] time when we shall
[32:14] know as we were known of
[32:17] God Amen God himself knows what is
[32:21] working he knows and day after day you
[32:27] this you overcome that you are going to
[32:30] see people fall
[32:32] away why do they fall away because they
[32:36] cannot
[32:38] stand to the end and bring forth that
[32:43] development you understand what I mean
[32:47] it's just the grace of
[32:49] God that we come to what we
[32:53] are if you are able to be a believer
[32:56] today
[32:57] and you are
[32:59] positive and you wake up the following
[33:01] day and you are a Believer and postive
[33:06] keep thanking
[33:08] God because the devil is not
[33:13] sleeping he's working day in and day out
[33:19] he keeps
[33:22] Judas in the mid of the
[33:25] church
[33:28] and you see Judas never
[33:31] leaves the S
[33:33] went but Judah never
[33:36] leaves until the last
[33:39] minute so I want to tell you that you
[33:43] must know who you
[33:45] are you are a
[33:48] seed growing in the midst of the
[33:55] tears but then your
[33:57] growth is going to be a constant
[34:02] mystery therefore it's necessary for
[34:05] us to remain in fellowship with the
[34:11] word because through the word we come to
[34:15] pick our self
[34:20] realization amen every one of you must
[34:24] come to a self realization
[34:28] amen of who you are where you come from
[34:33] and where you are
[34:36] headed because in the vine
[34:40] Year God deals with single
[34:45] seat to make the entire
[34:49] farm so you must
[34:52] tell you come to a self
[34:55] realization
[34:57] of what type of seed you
[35:00] are amen he says here and now to these
[35:05] sons of
[35:07] God who by him
[35:10] overcome are given the privilege of the
[35:13] paradise of
[35:19] God and the constant Fellowship of Jesus
[35:23] Christ there will never be any
[35:26] separation from
[35:29] him where he goes his bride will go what
[35:35] is he shares with his
[35:39] beloved on a joint ha
[35:43] relationship the secret things will be
[35:47] revealed the dark things will be made
[35:51] plain we shall know as we are known
[35:58] amen not as we were
[36:02] known but as we are
[36:05] known because God doesn't have a
[36:09] yesterday God doesn't have a
[36:13] tomorrow God is I
[36:16] am Hallelujah so there is a way he has
[36:20] always
[36:22] known and he says we shall
[36:25] know as we are known so once we in
[36:30] church we are
[36:32] growing to the revelation of who we
[36:36] are amen yes sir and we shall be like
[36:42] him this is the heritage of the
[36:47] Overcomer who was overcome by the blood
[36:50] of the
[36:52] lamb and the word of the testimony of
[36:54] Jesus
[36:55] Christ
[36:57] do you love him this
[36:59] morning amen so our
[37:03] inheritance is that we shall be like
[37:07] him but then this like
[37:10] him is a growing
[37:14] development amen we are a developing
[37:19] character amen and one of these days we
[37:23] shall become the
[37:25] expression of his eternal
[37:29] mind because he knew
[37:32] us he for the foundation of the
[37:36] world so as we keep
[37:40] growing we are
[37:42] growing to come to the
[37:45] realization of what we shall
[37:49] be amen so the Bible
[37:53] says that our names
[37:57] we placed on the L's book of
[38:01] life but what are these
[38:05] names are you together with
[38:08] me yes sir there is my brother M
[38:13] here he is called
[38:23] rers you can never find Rogers
[38:28] and you cannot find
[38:31] here so what's the
[38:34] name in the Lamb's Book of
[38:37] Life this is where I want you to come to
[38:40] a
[38:43] realization let me tell you
[38:46] friends we come from
[38:48] God and we have to go back
[38:51] to now your name in the L's Book of Life
[38:57] and your name here on
[38:59] Earth they are two different
[39:02] names
[39:05] Rogers was given by a
[39:08] father either as a CL
[39:12] name and the name
[39:14] Rogers either from
[39:17] anywhere he picks that name and is now
[39:22] roers and the father calls him Mambo
[39:25] rers
[39:28] and then he came to
[39:32] realize as he grows
[39:34] up that that's my
[39:37] name
[39:39] roers and then yes
[39:43] Mommy that's a natural
[39:48] name but then your
[39:51] name in the Lamb's Book of
[39:54] Life is not
[39:59] R so what is this
[40:02] name some of the people may
[40:05] say I want to get myself a Bible
[40:12] name so if I am
[40:15] James or John or Peter then my name is
[40:21] in the L's Book of
[40:23] Life that's not what it means
[40:28] because your
[40:29] name in the Lamb's Book of
[40:32] Life is not known by
[40:40] [Music]
[40:45] other are you together with me so what
[40:48] is the
[40:50] name a name I've always told
[40:53] you is the expression of character
[40:59] the principle behind
[41:02] names is to identify the
[41:07] character that's how names were given in
[41:10] the
[41:12] Bible they were
[41:14] given to underline the
[41:19] character okay and Adam
[41:25] said this is now Bor of my
[41:31] Bor and Flesh of My
[41:33] Flesh she shall be called
[41:37] woman because she was taken out of
[41:43] man Adam wakes
[41:46] up from the
[41:48] sleep he touched
[41:51] hiside and there was a missing
[41:54] rib and then when he looked
[41:57] there was a woman there and says you you
[42:02] came from
[42:03] born of my B you've come from Flesh of
[42:08] My Flesh you will be called
[42:12] woman because you came from
[42:16] me so that name identified the nature of
[42:23] Eve the Bible says and the child
[42:28] grew and she brought him to Pharaoh's
[42:34] daughter and became her
[42:38] son and she called his name
[42:42] Moses because I dream out of the
[42:47] water are you together with me so all
[42:53] places and all people
[42:56] All
[42:58] Occasions were named because of the
[43:03] circumstance so the natural
[43:06] names which were given to the
[43:12] Patriarchs it defined their
[43:17] inheritance brother Bram gave us the
[43:21] example and he said
[43:24] Ephraim epim means by the
[43:28] Sea so when Joshua was giving the
[43:33] inheritance he gave Ephraim by
[43:38] the are you together with me so now the
[43:43] name you can look
[43:46] at you know when the
[43:50] nature was
[43:52] changing God changed the names
[43:57] of these
[43:58] people like
[44:00] Abram he was he didn't have a
[44:03] child but when the promise
[44:06] came God called him
[44:09] Abraham to underline a new
[44:13] character that he was going to
[44:16] express and then
[44:20] sah SAR
[44:22] SAR she became Sarah
[44:27] because she was going to become a
[44:30] mother
[44:32] Jacob was born a
[44:35] supp but when his nature was changed of
[44:41] God he changed the name and called him
[44:46] Israel are you together with me Peter
[44:50] was
[44:51] Simon when he got the
[44:54] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[44:58] says Thou
[45:01] Peter is giving him a new name to
[45:05] underline a new
[45:07] character somebody say Amen there and
[45:10] then
[45:12] Saul becomes
[45:16] PA are you together with
[45:20] me becomes
[45:23] PA because there is a new manifestation
[45:29] of
[45:31] life so the
[45:34] name speaks of who you
[45:37] are I'm now not talking about this
[45:39] natural
[45:41] names and now
[45:44] God in
[45:46] Abraham
[45:48] Sarah
[45:50] Jacob Saul he
[45:54] participated in in changing the
[45:57] names natural
[45:59] names to teach us that there is a name
[46:04] that God knows us
[46:06] about so since the name speak of
[46:11] character then there is a
[46:14] character that God knows Us
[46:17] by and that's the
[46:20] name so the name in the last book of
[46:24] life
[46:28] is the cor of the
[46:31] elect that God has given
[46:35] him to
[46:38] manifest are you together with me he
[46:41] gave you a certain form of
[46:44] life that you are going to
[46:48] manifest so in Ephesians
[46:51] 1
[46:53] verse according as he has chosen Us in
[46:58] him before the foundation of the
[47:02] world that we should
[47:03] [Music]
[47:06] be that we should
[47:09] be so there is a
[47:12] stat God knew
[47:15] you and that God had
[47:20] determined that you are going to
[47:22] manifest that
[47:24] condition before you leave this
[47:29] Earth so in our
[47:33] election we find that that
[47:36] character is closely linked to the life
[47:40] of the
[47:43] Lamb are you together with me so your
[47:48] name in the last book of
[47:52] life means your character
[47:56] which is closely linked to the nature of
[47:59] the
[48:05] Lamb is not
[48:12] shw you find in
[48:15] church people that are going to be
[48:19] shrew you never understand
[48:23] them that's not the lamb
[48:27] so if you in the
[48:29] book your
[48:32] nature and character is closely linked
[48:36] to the
[48:37] lamb and now the lamb has got his way of
[48:43] life are you together with me so your
[48:47] name in the Lamb's Book of Life is your
[48:52] character which is like the life of the
[48:56] [Music]
[48:57] Lamb which is written in this
[49:03] book are you together with me so in our
[49:08] election our
[49:10] character is linked to the nature of the
[49:13] Lamb we grow towards the nature of the
[49:17] Lamb the more we feed on the
[49:20] word is the more of the Lamb nature we
[49:24] develop
[49:27] are you together with me God knew we're
[49:30] going to have the
[49:32] nature amen that was going to be
[49:38] redeemable in
[49:39] nature that would be comp to the
[49:49] lamb now look at the C of the
[49:54] Lamb when a lamb gets
[49:58] lost he can never recover
[50:04] himself and when a true child of
[50:08] God
[50:10] Strays
[50:12] sometimes it's difficult for them to
[50:17] realize the devil is taking them off the
[50:22] track they keep going m
[50:29] and he doesn't know where it's
[50:31] going you need a
[50:33] Ministry to keep you in the beaten
[50:37] path you are just a
[50:41] lamp you can easily
[50:44] stray and when the lamb is going to the
[50:49] slaughter it is always led by a
[50:54] god so you get a
[50:57] God in a
[51:00] congregation and it's reading the the
[51:02] god
[51:06] [Music]
[51:11] the and the prophet tells us once it
[51:15] gets to the
[51:16] Trap the goat
[51:20] jumps and the lamb is
[51:24] CAU God be
[51:27] merciful that we may have the
[51:30] life of the
[51:33] Lamb amen so th where he place your
[51:39] name as a particular
[51:42] character and that
[51:45] character is your
[51:50] adoption amen that's your
[51:54] adoption predestinated
[51:56] us after the adoption of
[51:59] children by Jesus Christ to
[52:03] himself so your name in the last book of
[52:07] life is the expression of divine
[52:12] character amen the nature of
[52:17] God blessing
[52:19] [Music]
[52:22] your
[52:23] amen so then that nature of
[52:29] God that's where your name
[52:34] is that's what we call the written
[52:39] epistle in life that you
[52:42] live so in plain
[52:45] language your name is the
[52:49] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in your
[52:53] life that's your new name
[52:57] listen let's go to Revelation 2 verse1
[53:05] 17 he that has a
[53:08] near let him hear what the spirit says
[53:11] out the
[53:17] churches
[53:20] to will I give him to eat of the Hidden
[53:24] manner
[53:27] and he'll give him a white
[53:31] stone and in the
[53:37] stone a new name
[53:41] written which no man
[53:45] know saving he that receives
[53:49] it so this name here is not written on
[53:54] the story
[53:56] Stone as the luganda translation
[54:01] WR it's written in the
[54:06] stone and that name if it was on the
[54:12] stone then everybody would know what it
[54:16] is but it's written in the
[54:21] stone so that he that has an ear
[54:26] he that has the Gen of
[54:30] God once he breaks six
[54:33] Revelation and this
[54:35] Revelation is the foundation of a White
[54:41] Rock you are standing on the
[54:44] Revelation and once that Revelation
[54:48] breaks you get a new
[54:52] name you get the character
[54:55] of the Holy Ghost to lead you on this
[54:58] Earthly
[55:00] Journey so you become a new
[55:03] name you become a new
[55:07] character you are not the old
[55:12] now no you become a new
[55:18] name you become a new
[55:21] character you become the written epistle
[55:29] you see where I'm coming from it's only
[55:33] that that can hear the calling of the
[55:37] name in the preaching of the
[55:40] word is only the
[55:42] elect whose Divine
[55:45] character can be
[55:47] restored because it was right
[55:54] there
[55:55] before the foundation of the world
[55:57] that's the way God knew
[56:01] you so
[56:07] we in the
[56:09] understanding of how
[56:11] God has always known
[56:16] us so in the white stone of
[56:21] Revelation in the white stone of
[56:23] Revelation
[56:26] is where we find the
[56:28] name and that name is personal to
[56:32] [Music]
[56:34] holder which no man
[56:38] know that
[56:42] receive praise
[56:44] God Amen so these names are hidden in
[56:48] the
[56:49] word and
[56:51] therefore revealed by the word
[56:55] when I preach the word and you take the
[56:59] Revelation and you live by it answering
[57:03] back to your
[57:06] name amen thou
[57:09] Peter and upon this
[57:12] Revelation I will build my
[57:17] church listen to what brother Bram says
[57:21] here the book doesn't say
[57:32] is to be saved in time of this church
[57:45] age okay no it don't say
[57:49] that it only shows the
[57:52] mystery Hallelujah
[57:56] the book doesn't
[57:59] say will be saved in this
[58:05] generation no the way the name
[58:12] is is by bringing the
[58:16] mystery and when you receive the
[58:19] mystery as
[58:21] Revelation you are answering to your
[58:23] name
[58:25] that's your name in the
[58:28] book he just said behold I sent you
[58:31] Elijah the
[58:34] prophet but then for you to catch that
[58:39] revelation of that
[58:41] elah then that means you are the one
[58:44] they will say
[58:48] you I will send
[58:51] you and once you get the revelation
[58:55] you are answering to your
[58:57] name when you see the word says
[59:01] repent and then you realize the word is
[59:05] talking to
[59:06] you that's your
[59:09] name are you together with me when the
[59:13] word says forgive one
[59:15] another and you forgive you take it
[59:19] knowing he is talking to
[59:21] me then your name in the bck
[59:26] it begins the word changes your
[59:31] character and as the word keeps changing
[59:34] your
[59:36] character then you are manifesting your
[59:38] new
[59:42] name hallelujah hallelujah so but by
[59:47] constantly being the
[59:50] word we become a developing
[59:53] character
[59:56] you see when I was coming
[59:59] here I was thinking along the
[1:00:04] way but I am a teacher of
[1:00:11] hope I teach
[1:00:13] hope I don't teach
[1:00:18] despair I don't teach
[1:00:23] desp
[1:00:25] no I want you to
[1:00:27] know that you are part of the program of
[1:00:37] God if I was not a teacher of
[1:00:41] hope I would come down here and make you
[1:00:45] feel a
[1:00:48] sinner but because I'm a teacher of
[1:00:52] hope I know you are going to overcome
[1:00:58] amen I place the system the method the
[1:01:03] principle by which you can
[1:01:11] overcome and he always knows the end
[1:01:14] from the
[1:01:17] beginning he says that the
[1:01:22] works will finish from the foundation of
[1:01:25] the
[1:01:28] world are you together with me the works
[1:01:31] were
[1:01:32] finished from the foundation of the
[1:01:36] world and when we come to the end of the
[1:01:40] journey he just says come and take the
[1:01:44] kingdom which was prepared for you
[1:01:47] before the
[1:01:49] foundation why because he knew you so he
[1:01:54] prepared the
[1:01:55] Kingdom so what I'm doing is to preach
[1:01:59] away the
[1:02:02] fog so that you can know who you
[1:02:06] are in the plan of
[1:02:10] God if that mist goes
[1:02:14] away then you start saying thank
[1:02:18] God I am a child of
[1:02:20] God I overcame this even that I'm going
[1:02:26] to yes sir you are not called
[1:02:31] out to be destroyed in the
[1:02:34] wilderness you were called to be Joshua
[1:02:37] and
[1:02:38] Cal to go and inherit your
[1:02:42] position amen praise
[1:02:46] God Amen listen to brother
[1:02:50] here watch carefully
[1:02:52] now and see this
[1:02:55] before there was ever a spe of
[1:03:08] Stardust before God was
[1:03:12] God because God is an object of
[1:03:16] adoration God is an object of
[1:03:21] adoration and no one who was there to
[1:03:23] worship Him
[1:03:25] so he was at that time only potentially
[1:03:31] God Amen so he's talking about before
[1:03:35] there were
[1:03:39] Angels because the creation of
[1:03:42] angels made the
[1:03:45] worshipers and then God became
[1:03:49] God before that he was a
[1:03:53] creator
[1:03:56] he was known only as eternal
[1:04:01] spirit the bride was already in his
[1:04:07] mind yes she
[1:04:10] was she was existing in his
[1:04:14] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[1:04:17] of
[1:04:19] God they are Eternal are they
[1:04:23] not
[1:04:25] are you together with me listen the
[1:04:28] prophet is telling you even before God
[1:04:31] created the
[1:04:34] Angels you were in the mind of
[1:04:39] God but then is telling you
[1:04:44] here that the thoughts of
[1:04:48] God are
[1:04:50] Eternal then he asks are they not
[1:04:56] the thoughts of
[1:04:58] God are
[1:04:59] Eternal so the reason why you
[1:05:05] believe is because we're in the mind of
[1:05:09] God that's what I've always told
[1:05:12] you from John
[1:05:19] 52424 the holy spirit says
[1:05:22] here in five
[1:05:25] uh
[1:05:27] 24 amen verily verily I say unto
[1:05:33] you he that Hearth my
[1:05:38] word now the word
[1:05:43] hear is present
[1:05:49] continuous meaning he that keeps himself
[1:05:53] in my
[1:05:56] where and Believe on him that sent
[1:06:01] me has everlasting
[1:06:04] life you have everlasting
[1:06:08] life that's why you are continuing in
[1:06:11] the
[1:06:13] word you may have
[1:06:17] battles you may have
[1:06:19] weaknesses you may have
[1:06:22] failures that's just
[1:06:26] F and that's what we are trying to
[1:06:28] preach
[1:06:30] out that you can become
[1:06:34] clear at the center of
[1:06:37] light and you become the light of the
[1:06:42] world you were in
[1:06:44] God before the foundation of the world
[1:06:48] and he says God's thoughts are
[1:06:52] Eternal are they not
[1:06:56] so why do you have eternal
[1:06:58] life is it because you came to the
[1:07:02] Altar and you knelt
[1:07:05] down no you have eternal life because
[1:07:10] were in
[1:07:13] God and then you
[1:07:15] drank you smoked you did everything
[1:07:19] else that was just a
[1:07:22] fog that was surrounding
[1:07:26] you but you come to a time when you
[1:07:30] discover who you
[1:07:32] are and once you
[1:07:35] discover you can never
[1:07:40] fail I made my
[1:07:42] decision not because I wanted to please
[1:07:45] brother so and so only I wanted to
[1:07:48] breing sister so and so I made my
[1:07:52] decision because Revelation came to me
[1:07:56] that I've always been a Son of
[1:07:59] God and then you
[1:08:01] decide to walk away from the
[1:08:05] darkness into the
[1:08:07] light you are God's Eternal
[1:08:10] thoughts and these thoughts here are
[1:08:14] totally different from your
[1:08:18] thoughts your thoughts are
[1:08:22] ideas but the thoughts of
[1:08:26] God is an
[1:08:29] existence they are not a
[1:08:32] meditation that one day when I get money
[1:08:37] I build a house like this and like this
[1:08:40] and like
[1:08:42] this you are
[1:08:46] beginning the thoughts of
[1:08:48] man always have a
[1:08:51] beginning but the thoughts of God have
[1:08:55] always
[1:08:57] been they for they
[1:09:02] Eternal this is deep isn't
[1:09:05] it to discover who you
[1:09:09] are let's go to this quotes
[1:09:12] here he says the Eternal thoughts of
[1:09:16] God let me ask you are the thoughts of
[1:09:21] God
[1:09:22] eternal
[1:09:28] the prophet said the Eternal thoughts of
[1:09:31] God let me ask you are the thoughts of
[1:09:35] God
[1:09:41] Eternal if you can see
[1:09:43] this you'll see many
[1:09:47] things that's not me saying
[1:09:50] now that's brother
[1:09:52] Bram that if you can see
[1:09:55] this you will see many
[1:09:59] things God is unchangeable in both and
[1:10:07] behavior we have
[1:10:10] studed and proven that
[1:10:13] already God is infinite in his
[1:10:17] abilities so therefore he as God must be
[1:10:22] ominent
[1:10:25] if is
[1:10:26] omn then he's not now
[1:10:30] learning nor is he taking Cel even with
[1:10:38] himself is he any time adding to his
[1:10:44] knowledge if he can add to his
[1:10:47] knowledge then is not
[1:10:49] omnis the best we could say is that some
[1:10:53] time he
[1:10:57] be but that's not
[1:11:03] scripture are you together with
[1:11:06] me understand the mind of
[1:11:11] God he's
[1:11:14] omnicient he's not taking new
[1:11:17] knowledge he's not adding anything to
[1:11:19] his
[1:11:21] understanding and he doesn't even draw
[1:11:23] his to his
[1:11:30] own bre no no no no no that's not
[1:11:34] God he's
[1:11:37] omniscent he has never had a new
[1:11:40] thought about
[1:11:42] anything because all he
[1:11:46] thoughts he has always had and always
[1:11:49] will have and know the
[1:11:52] end from the
[1:11:55] beginning because he
[1:11:58] God thus the thoughts of
[1:12:02] God is
[1:12:05] eternal they are
[1:12:08] real they are not simply like a
[1:12:11] man with a blueprint which he has grown
[1:12:18] up and one day will be translated in
[1:12:21] substance and form
[1:12:24] but the thoughts of
[1:12:26] God are already
[1:12:30] real and
[1:12:32] eternal and the part of
[1:12:35] God hallelujah
[1:12:38] hallelujah he says if you understand
[1:12:42] this you'll understand a lot
[1:12:44] of that the mind of God is not like the
[1:12:49] mind of a
[1:12:51] man the mind of God
[1:12:54] is
[1:12:55] eternal God doesn't see
[1:12:58] you as a struggling
[1:13:01] baby God sees you as a crowned
[1:13:08] Christian are you together with me he
[1:13:11] wants to see you
[1:13:13] there that's why he SS the
[1:13:16] word so that you may
[1:13:20] develop into the mind of God
[1:13:24] as he saw you from before the foundation
[1:13:27] of the
[1:13:29] world where as
[1:13:33] Eternal as God is
[1:13:35] eternal we
[1:13:38] existed in God has an eternal
[1:13:42] thought are you together with me I've
[1:13:45] always given you
[1:13:48] demonstration amen that we come from God
[1:13:53] and
[1:13:55] God a piece of
[1:13:58] himself of
[1:14:00] himself just like
[1:14:04] this and then he made man but he remains
[1:14:07] the main
[1:14:10] body so now when he made man he made him
[1:14:15] in the image and
[1:14:18] likeness and that image and
[1:14:21] likeness was his
[1:14:25] spirit and this
[1:14:28] Spirit which made Adam and
[1:14:31] Eve was
[1:14:33] eternal as God was
[1:14:38] eternal but when he placed them in the
[1:14:42] body there was a
[1:14:44] fall but God says
[1:14:46] no I'm going to redeem
[1:14:49] man do you know why because if this way
[1:14:54] Eternal and they were part of
[1:14:57] God how can they get
[1:15:01] destroyed how can you cut off your
[1:15:04] hand and survive
[1:15:08] happily he says no I will redeem my
[1:15:13] portion and for 6,000 years God has been
[1:15:18] redeeming back
[1:15:20] his to bring it back to
[1:15:24] himself and that person is his own
[1:15:28] Spirit which he endorses in his own
[1:15:34] bride so in the internal
[1:15:39] Dimension the thoughts of
[1:15:41] God are
[1:15:45] unexist we were in the waiting for our
[1:15:50] season now
[1:15:52] listen they are etern the thoughts of
[1:15:56] God God doesn't speak like
[1:15:59] you I'll give you an example of the
[1:16:03] prophet
[1:16:05] Isaiah the prophet Isaiah was
[1:16:09] prophesying about the coming of
[1:16:12] Christ and then he says unto us a son is
[1:16:18] born that is
[1:16:21] God everybody look
[1:16:24] around
[1:16:26] where where tell us the village tell us
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:33] mother but as far as God is
[1:16:36] concerned he has no
[1:16:38] future unto us a son is
[1:16:42] born but God in his great wisdom he to
[1:16:47] come into the
[1:16:52] of
[1:16:54] and also go back into his own
[1:16:57] way I'll take you to Isaiah
[1:17:00] 53 and then verse
[1:17:04] two you know he has told us a son is
[1:17:10] born for he shall grow up before him as
[1:17:13] a tender plant
[1:17:22] 532 and as a root out of a dry
[1:17:27] ground he has no form no
[1:17:32] C and when we shall
[1:17:35] see there's no beauty that we should
[1:17:37] desire of
[1:17:40] it so Isaiah in this
[1:17:44] verse speaks about
[1:17:47] Christ from the standpoint of
[1:17:51] man and he says
[1:17:53] he shall grow
[1:17:55] up and when we shall see
[1:17:58] him then he switches
[1:18:00] back in the standpoint of God and says
[1:18:05] he has no
[1:18:10] cess see because he is reading from an
[1:18:15] eternal
[1:18:19] existence so the future standing before
[1:18:23] for
[1:18:25] God is a present
[1:18:28] reality that's the mind of
[1:18:32] God Amen listen to verse
[1:18:36] three he is
[1:18:39] despise and rejected of
[1:18:43] men a Man of
[1:18:46] Sorrows acquainted with
[1:18:50] grief and he does wear our faces from
[1:18:54] him he was
[1:18:57] despised and resed him
[1:19:01] not so before
[1:19:03] God all things are in
[1:19:07] present but Isaiah starts in the
[1:19:11] position of
[1:19:14] man to watch
[1:19:16] us as God would watch
[1:19:21] us when we touch into the expression of
[1:19:24] his
[1:19:27] mind Isaiah would stand back and then
[1:19:35] sh but then he says
[1:19:38] here a son is
[1:19:40] born so he stands
[1:19:44] out and he watches
[1:19:46] you how you H from Abram to
[1:19:51] Abraham
[1:19:53] from Jacob to
[1:19:55] Israel from Simon to
[1:19:59] Peter from Saul to
[1:20:02] Paul he has called us to be
[1:20:06] holy and without
[1:20:09] blem he stays back
[1:20:12] here and watches you as you hat out you
[1:20:17] hat out of the
[1:20:20] bar you hat out of a GBL
[1:20:24] you hat out of every kind of
[1:20:27] stuff and everything is bringing you out
[1:20:31] of you are manifesting glory to another
[1:20:35] glory to another glory to another Glory
[1:20:40] until you bring forth the image that God
[1:20:44] saw from before the
[1:20:47] foundation that's how God is dealing
[1:20:49] with
[1:20:50] us he knows the struggles or our
[1:20:54] path he knows our
[1:20:56] trials through all your trials you Prest
[1:21:00] of the adoption of
[1:21:03] sons because those trials are
[1:21:06] necessary to build your
[1:21:11] character so you were in the mind of
[1:21:16] God but God allowed
[1:21:19] you to bypass your the
[1:21:24] so that you can come here to bet
[1:21:28] tray are you together with me to be try
[1:21:33] your patience will be
[1:21:36] try your love will be
[1:21:39] try your family life will be
[1:21:43] try because you came here to be Tred and
[1:21:48] when you overcome you get back into your
[1:21:51] image
[1:21:54] rejoice when the Trials come your
[1:21:58] way and War
[1:22:01] you if you are the
[1:22:04] cause of Lamentations of the
[1:22:11] Saints brother Bram
[1:22:14] says but you bypass
[1:22:18] the and become flesh
[1:22:21] man to be temped by
[1:22:25] sin it is sin that tempts
[1:22:29] you so what did we
[1:22:33] bypass in in
[1:22:36] the because we bypassed a character of
[1:22:43] Glory we
[1:22:46] bypassed and we came into the body to be
[1:22:51] try in the body here you may not even
[1:22:55] realize that you are a son of God that
[1:22:59] was in the mind of
[1:23:02] God John believed
[1:23:06] it but there were still an element that
[1:23:09] he
[1:23:11] needed for the Assurance of his
[1:23:15] salvation and John lifted him I mean God
[1:23:18] lifted
[1:23:19] him and said come up here
[1:23:23] dealt with his
[1:23:26] experience and it changed the life of
[1:23:31] John something will have to
[1:23:33] happen to change our
[1:23:37] lives
[1:23:39] amen so
[1:23:41] Jesus when he was coming here on Earth
[1:23:45] he came through that glorious
[1:23:48] character and he knew all
[1:23:51] things but then in that glorious
[1:23:55] character it's not only knowledge we
[1:24:00] bypassed but we bypassed a spiritual
[1:24:06] condition God brought us here to
[1:24:10] overcome in order to step into that
[1:24:13] character of
[1:24:15] glory
[1:24:18] amen praise the
[1:24:21] Lord I make it it has been hard on me
[1:24:25] through the
[1:24:27] service but the Lord is
[1:24:30] gracious amen and that's why John
[1:24:34] says see you need to discover
[1:24:38] yourself listen to John
[1:24:45] 47 he discovered who he
[1:24:49] was he says hearing is our love made
[1:24:56] perfect joh first John
[1:25:02] 4:17 here in is our love made
[1:25:09] perfect that we may have
[1:25:13] boldness in the day of
[1:25:21] judgment
[1:25:27] what gives you
[1:25:30] boldness on the day of
[1:25:34] judgment John
[1:25:36] says because as he
[1:25:39] is so are we in this
[1:25:44] world that gives you
[1:25:47] boldness on the day of
[1:25:50] judgment that as he
[1:25:53] is his
[1:25:56] spirit in a
[1:25:58] body amen which is
[1:26:01] glorify so are
[1:26:03] we in this world we are Spirit of his
[1:26:09] Spirit Although our
[1:26:12] bodies are not glorified
[1:26:15] yet as he is so are we so we should hide
[1:26:21] that Glory
[1:26:24] behind the curtains of
[1:26:27] time hallelujah hallelujah the Glorious
[1:26:31] nature of
[1:26:33] Christ Is Now hidden behind the curtain
[1:26:36] of
[1:26:39] time this here is the
[1:26:41] curtain but inside there there is the
[1:26:46] glory like the glory that he
[1:26:51] is so is the glory that we
[1:26:55] are but sometimes we look at one
[1:26:59] another from the
[1:27:04] Flesh and once we lose the revelation of
[1:27:07] who we
[1:27:09] are we may not be able to make
[1:27:12] it when I see you let me see the glory
[1:27:17] of
[1:27:19] God when I shake the hand of
[1:27:23] Ben bless you let it be from my
[1:27:28] heart when I say I forgive you my
[1:27:32] brother let it come from
[1:27:35] the we should
[1:27:37] stop operating by the
[1:27:41] flesh the
[1:27:43] Christian is the seed on the inside of
[1:27:51] you together with me
[1:27:54] this okay let me give you this
[1:27:59] quot we by
[1:28:02] okay to come in this body but after been
[1:28:07] Tri and we've overcome then we join back
[1:28:12] our and we are
[1:28:14] connected to the same
[1:28:17] Glory that Jesus is
[1:28:20] now but the we have is that we have that
[1:28:26] Glory already
[1:28:28] here in the C of
[1:28:32] time
[1:28:34] listen thean is the human body that's
[1:28:39] glorified not exactly with flesh and
[1:28:44] blood like it will be in its glorified
[1:28:49] state but it is a form of a human body
[1:28:54] that doesn't
[1:28:55] eat that doesn't
[1:28:57] drink it's a body that's waiting for
[1:29:02] us as soon as we leave this world now in
[1:29:07] here in there we enter into that
[1:29:10] body and that's the kind of
[1:29:13] body that God
[1:29:16] was
[1:29:18] he for he said let us make man in our
[1:29:23] image and in our
[1:29:27] likeness So
[1:29:30] Adam in Genesis
[1:29:33] 1 was a body of
[1:29:37] Glory when we
[1:29:40] overcome these bodies of
[1:29:45] malice
[1:29:47] speaking out of
[1:29:49] us we shall join those B is of Glory
[1:29:57] again so the word
[1:30:01] Glory what does it mean the body of
[1:30:05] Glory it is that
[1:30:09] brightness is that
[1:30:13] Splendor is that
[1:30:16] Excellence is the majest like which
[1:30:19] surrounds the
[1:30:20] angels
[1:30:22] God in a pillar of
[1:30:25] fire Glory means the most glorious
[1:30:30] condition it refers to the condition of
[1:30:33] God in
[1:30:36] heaven that's what the glory we missed
[1:30:40] is and when we
[1:30:42] overcome we join back into that
[1:30:47] glory amen is that glorious condition of
[1:30:51] blessing
[1:30:54] so in that
[1:30:55] nature was all the character of God
[1:31:02] embedded let us make Mone in our
[1:31:06] image and then
[1:31:09] Adam was Spirit of his
[1:31:13] Spirit God had L Adam all his
[1:31:19] attributes and he says let Adam be the
[1:31:22] God on
[1:31:24] Earth and Rule all the
[1:31:26] creation I will be the God in
[1:31:32] heaven are you together with me so in
[1:31:35] that nature was all the character of
[1:31:39] God and God pass all his
[1:31:43] authority and all his power and All His
[1:31:47] glory to Adam on Earth and then the
[1:31:51] Bible says God blessed
[1:31:54] him and in that
[1:31:57] blessing he was
[1:31:59] fruitful he would
[1:32:01] multiply and replace the Earth subdue it
[1:32:06] and have
[1:32:09] dominion that's where I
[1:32:12] failed and for 6,000
[1:32:15] years that's what God has been
[1:32:19] restoring one of this in the day in the
[1:32:24] mum we shall be in that
[1:32:31] promise I'll teach on things that are to
[1:32:34] be one
[1:32:37] day you see people are saying we are
[1:32:39] going to
[1:32:42] heaven those people who don't like to
[1:32:50] work
[1:32:53] brother they are waiting for
[1:32:56] heaven in heaven you'll be there for
[1:33:00] three and a half
[1:33:02] years and then come
[1:33:06] back what Adam fail to do with the
[1:33:10] Earth is what you are going to
[1:33:13] do he was given a body to te the
[1:33:20] ground Hallelujah
[1:33:24] Hallelujah see one of these
[1:33:26] days we shall realize who we
[1:33:31] are what God had in his
[1:33:36] mind amen so after the New
[1:33:40] Birth then God restores that character
[1:33:44] back to
[1:33:46] us but he hides that
[1:33:49] character in the word
[1:33:53] do you want to find out who you
[1:33:56] are you go to the
[1:33:59] word the word is what reveals
[1:34:04] you as you study the word you become a
[1:34:08] developing
[1:34:10] character so second Peter 1
[1:34:15] verse4 I'm finishing in a few
[1:34:18] minutes amen yes sir yes
[1:34:24] so second Peter 1
[1:34:28] verse4
[1:34:30] whereby are given unto us the exceeding
[1:34:33] great and precious promises in the
[1:34:45] world that by these
[1:34:49] promises in the world
[1:34:52] we might be partakers of a divine
[1:34:57] nature how do we have the nature of God
[1:35:03] back God hid it in the
[1:35:06] word and as you study that
[1:35:09] word it reveals the nature of
[1:35:13] God and as you take that
[1:35:16] nature you are taking your
[1:35:19] adoption you are taking the new name
[1:35:22] you are taking the new
[1:35:24] character amen so listen to what he says
[1:35:29] here now we see the attribute signs of
[1:35:31] his
[1:35:33] Spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:35:36] word from
[1:35:38] body
[1:35:41] but this body is subject to the
[1:35:47] word amen waiting for the Hest ch of the
[1:35:53] body amen he
[1:35:57] said when that Spirit join in
[1:36:01] there it is
[1:36:03] honest and looking for the change of the
[1:36:07] body so an
[1:36:10] attribute is an Inseparable
[1:36:14] property amen so all of us from
[1:36:18] Adam to the last elected one
[1:36:22] we are attribute sons of
[1:36:30] God and we must grow
[1:36:33] back into the image he saw us
[1:36:38] by amen that's my
[1:36:41] desire Lord help me that I may
[1:36:46] grow into the mind of
[1:36:49] God different ways God deals with
[1:36:56] us

[1:37:01] come to what you want me to
[1:37:07] be help
[1:37:09] me to
[1:37:12] come and
[1:37:14] devour into the
[1:37:17] mind that God s me back
[1:37:22] before the foundation of the
[1:37:25] world that's my
[1:37:27] prayer and that's your
[1:37:29] prayer and how can we get
[1:37:32] there by being in this
[1:37:35] word that's where he has hidden the
[1:37:39] steps so as you study the
[1:37:42] word your life will become brighter
[1:37:45] today you the word it becomes brighter
[1:37:50] tomorrow the word it becomes brighter
