TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so you know God brother Bram tells us he had the three F purose so you know when you are talking about three fold purose there must be a first fold there must be a second F and then the third f the prophet says here Christ the Myster of God revealed notice God has had the three F purpose in this great mystery secret amen God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he has a threefold purpose in it are you together now amen he has three four but he didn't start it in time it is something that he had before the world began but as you know mystery got become Revelation by the teachings of the prophets and by the scriptures then we come to realize what this secret mystery is knowing and understanding it that's where we build the church this secr mystery he says here the first thing was God wanted to reveal himself to the people that's the first fall God stepping out and revealing himself to the people so knowing and understanding God is the first thought but not the last He makes himself known for a purpose he want to preeminence in his people in his church and this church here is the Messianic Kingdom amen why do we call it a Messianic Kingdom because he has called out a people that were heathens and Believers and bring them together and reveal himself to them as their Messiah to wash their sin and to restore unto them the life that they had lost by the sin of Adam are you together with me yes sir So He makes himself known for a purpose God didn't just come and stepped into the body of Christ and reveal himself as God just for the sake of it there was a purpose why God came in Christ amen secondly in the fault was preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in a people praise the Lord he doesn't come to reveal himself Place himself here and then the people are here that was not the purpose because if he's there and we are here he becomes an idol amen but when he came and revealed himself his purpose was to live in a people that's the second four God is revealed to un elect and immediately desires to take preeminence regardless of one's previous condition amen whether this man was a thief like zakas whether he was a murderer like sa whether he was an intellectual like Dr Luke when God reveals himself to an elect the purpose is that he wants to as a kingdom in your life he wants to have the preeminence amen praise the Lord now listen here he reveals himself to aut and his name is sa but when Saul is testifying in Galatians chapter 1 verse 15 he says but when it pleased God hallelujah this is not for sa only but is also for you it pleased God who separated you from your mother's and called you by his grace he was not looking at the good things that you have done he says I I am separating you from your mother's womb for a special purpose and I'm doing this by grace that I may manifest myself soul in your life is that amen verse 16 the purpose was to reveal his son in me amen not reveal his son to me but the son revealed to me must step on the inside of my life to have preeminence and then revealed through me are you together with me to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heen immediately confer not with flesh Flesh and Blood this Revelation here cannot be negotiated are you together with me if God is revealed to you you don't confer with blood say oh do you think I should believe this no you just can't do that he Paul says I could confer with flesh and blood he did go back to Jerusalem to the headquarters of the priest and say excuse me there is an experience I had onas and then this Jesus spoke to me saying so should I believe him he says I confor not with flesh and blood a true Revelation to a Believer overrides what your friend can advise you excels beyond what the community can accept or discuss or debate Amen in verse 15 Paul talks of the calling of Grace but in 16 he speaks of God taking over the pinenes to reveal his son in me when you are called into the grace of God the purpose is that you become a vessel of the revelation of the goodness of God Amen am that that is Christ at the throne then and when he gets at the Throne of Our Lives it deems everything in our [Applause] lives amen when you look at the things you see seem to have love you start almost trying to find where they you start to ask where was the joy in this you start wondering because the revelation of Christ to you deems everything the other day I taken my car to a garage and this was this young man he was falling and rising in the early hours and he was saying and he's back again when the Lord Vis such a man he begins to ask where was the joy in this you see so Paul says I count all things but loss amen for the Excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord in order for you to know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and enjoy it you have to count everything else lost you must allow everything to De when Christ met on the way to Damascus amen listen friends the light by which Paul was seeing things became Darkness the only light is when Christ opened his eyes again he closed his eyes to the worldall the sunshine became dark he couldn't see nothing and when his eyes got open he had a different look at things it's our prayer that we may have a different look at things is that amen so to a true Christian the calling of Grace must eventually establish a kingdom amen it must drop a kingdom life into you amen Paul says for I have suffered loss amen completely all the knowledge and the wisdom and the authority that so it became nothing and Christ became prominent in his own life amen so Christ in you becomes a kingdom when he takes the preeminence you seize and Christ takes over amen praise the Lord yes sir when Christ Steed into the life of John the Baptist John the Baptist says I must decrease that he may increase I know some of us are so smart intellectually we are special uh pieces in community amen but then when Christ is revealed to you there is something on the side that keeps telling you sees that Christ may have the preeminence you sees in your natural reason you allow Christ to take over your kingdom your life then is about church and the word maybe your work and family are you together with me a lot of these leure things where we think we are going to Resource Joy they begin to get dim before us where people are so gloomy and you know they are very sad because Arenal has lost and you say hello how are you they don't want to answer but once you have Christ the joy of the Lord is not seasonal it is permanent praise God when a man smites you on the face brother Bram says the lordship controls you amen your hand sees to be so fast when your wife there something you don't like the Lord the King on the inside takes control he takes control of your tongue amen how you talk to your wife how you talk to your husband there is a king he has preeminence he controls when someone says something about you the lordship of Christ in you takes control you are not your own anymore Christ has taken over your kingdom he has taken over your mind he has taken over your amen you now belong to a kingdom so when the doctor says I am sorry but my medical skill says You must die there's nothing more we can do but the lordship of Christ controls you by his word saying by his ch we will healed Hallelujah there is a ky praise God yes sir let me say this and this is very Prime in our series amen that God had [Music] understood but him the preeminence makes him an idol because an idol is a powerless God are you together with me the purpose of this Revelation the mystery secret is reveal himself to the people so that he can have the preeminence not to reveal himself to the knowledge so that you may understand that there is one God but the purpose of the Revelation is for him to have preeminence amen how I desire would say I mean sing and [Music] say I surrender all amen got my hands full but I surrender all I don't want to be like a rich young ruler who wanted to have it all and still have Christ you have your pleasures entertainment all kinds of friends they make a big portion of your life and on top of that you want to include Christ he says no through where your reaches and then come and follow me amen so I surrender all no longer I but Christ that liveth in me is allowing him to build the kingdom amen when he revealed himself to Ezekiel he took the preeminence he did not allow Ezekiel to be here and then he's just watching something over there whenever God is revealed and is revealed to man he involves man into that Revelation when he revealed himself to Moses Amen on Mount hor told him remove your shoes the place where he standing is the holy Place praise God you catch a revelation you explain the godhead but you don't allow God to have the preeminence that is not God he remains an idol when he revealed himself to Ezekiel he took preeminence when you read the whole chapter one and then Ezekiel is in a presence he says I saw the visions of God and then when he gets to verse 28 he says this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and when I saw it I fell upon my face and I had a voice of one that SP this Revelation here bring Mission and brings in a voice are you together with me he says when I say I fell to my face amen there submission hallelujah hallelujah when he revealed himself to Daniel Daniel chapter verse 8 praise God he says therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remain no strength in me from my cess was turned me into corruption and I retained no strength yet had the voice of his word my God are you together with me he says yes I heard the voice of his word the revelation of God will always cause you to submit to him and will have the preeminence you will hear his voice you hear his instructions amen when he reveals himself to John in Revelation 1 verse 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me praise the Lord when you have the ability to explain the fullness of the goded B in Christ and it has no influence over you then that is a definition of an idol but the god that we serve when he gets revealed to you he takes over the [Music] preeminence that's the purpose praise God when you know him by Revelation when you know him other way amen that's different but when you know him by Revelation he takes over the preeminence he begins to control our Liv praise God he speaks to us by the word amen and you know sometimes excuse me sometimes listen to me friends we are in church because we have a friend in church and once you were in church simply because you are a friend in you have a friend listen then you are in the category of [Music] lot because lot entered can because of his uncle Abraham are you together with me and so when lot got in there he found out he didn't have an inheritance and then he began to fight his uncle for inheritance all these War you see in church is people have comeing and they have no inheritance they are trying to have something they can lay a hand on are you together with me so you find that you are in the category of lot but if you had the call he ended up becoming submissive to the almighty God and also subject to the word amen the first is God revealing himself the second for is God having preeminence amen so there was a man by calling he was a prophet his name was Isaiah but you see his life amen Was A God Called Prophet but there the C of a holy man before him and that holy man was called and you know is the King who has got the history to have ruled the nation of Israel for longer years than even D of [Music] Solomon and he was a very kind of successful King and his life was meticulous amen so when Isaiah came to church the life of that man mized him so much he couldn't go beyond that curtain and that's a very big problem when brother Bram was preaching on the different messages on the influence he was always taking the subject of Isaiah amen and you know it talks about Isaiah who had a c before him and so brother BR was preaching those messages in such a way that he may tell the people that I don't want to become your C amen so at the end of the services he would always turn his back and then he says see see who is this one he says that's the one who visited Abraham in M you know he had his back turned to the tent but he had the ability of seeing sah and say why did sah and then as he turns out here he would say you come from such and such a place you you got such and such a problem you've seen such a number of doctors your name is so and so you live in a mountaineous country so that he can help them to understand that this is not him this is God are you together with me so let's look at Isaiah here a little bit now if you fall into the category of Isaiah and it's honestly that God has called you and you really feel that you have got a touch of God upon your life but somehow somewhere you are under the control of the leadership of a man or a woman you admire this man could be your father this woman could be your wife may but then you need to come to a point where you look Beyond him and have access to Christ listen to what Isaiah says in Isaiah chapter 6 verse1 in theing this wonderful King I saw also the Lord amen he had never had a person experience but the year that King is I saw also the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up and this train filled the temple God revealing himself to isah and immediately Isaiah realized that he needed justification he needed sanctification he needed the Bas of the Holy Ghost and he needed to be blessed in the body because immediately after that amen then verse five says then say is me for I am because I am a man of unlean lips my company is a bad one amen and I dwell in the M of a PE of un clean yet my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts the company kep had a reflection on his character some of the things we do is we a part of church but outside there we've got another [Music] influence Isaiah says who unto me now that I have seen God I desire to take sanctification amen is that amen for everybody that God May touch you [Music] amen touch your lips sometimes our lips are never shut we start saying things every time there was a place where I was with my wife nice quiet home nice quiet nice quiet home amen the was wonderful but then came in this young man he never stops he was I said since this young man came he can't keep quiet and he was a music instructor amen and this is a singing family so he started now on the music when the music is over still sometimes when you speak a lot you forget what you said and people will start fearing because you even deny the very things you said did I say that I don't think I am mad he says I sit in the compan of men with unclean lips you if God is going to help us we must accept our weakness Isaiah says my problem I've got un clean and I company together with men of unlean Li and when he said like that down came Amen in verse six unto me having a life call in his hand which had taken with the tong from the off the alt and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lord this has touched that [Music] lips and iniquity is taken away and th sin he needed a p needed to be made clear but you see all this cannot come until you have come into presence when you come into presence you can't stand with your arrogance you cannot stand there with pointing fingers all the men who have come into that presence they've always testified that they felt their face and Daniel said my came to nothing his Holiness became nothing praise God but sometimes we come to church and our job is to keep judging one another pointing to one another once you have the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll always point to yourself Lord have Mery upon me Lord give me the grace that I need amen he says here in verse eight also I heard the voice of the Lord say shall I go for usby send me that is revelation and preeminence are you together with me God revealing himself to man and then taking the preeminence the three F purpose that's the order upon which God wants to receive you he wants to reveal himself to you and then he wants also to have preeminence he wants to exercise control based on obedience to the word amen praise God so God always desires to inhabit a tabernacle because God in a tabernacle becomes a Messianic Kingdom because it takes control a king rules a king governs a King Controls a king sets everything in order so when God becomes the king of the Messianic Kingdom it doesn't come as a decoration he says I have come down here to take over your life did you hear that amen so God always desires to inhabit his Tabernacle let us go and look at the Kingdom Here Acts chapter one are you still there somebody say amen amen AMS 1 verse 2 until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many proofs being seen of them 40 days after the resurrection and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God he's revealing himself and he's speaking Revelation to you and then he's now placing them into Kingdom and for 40 days after the resurrection he speaking to them about the Kingdom so this day was we are talking about in scripture here is the Day of His Ascension and he spent the speaking of the Messianic Kingdom but the disciples mix this information with the political Kingdom of Israel is talking about a messic kingdom but they are talking about the Kingdom of Israel but remember after the Kings of Israel failed there was not another political Kingdom of Israel promise but the mess Kingdom and thereafter would come the millennial Kingdom the rule of Christ here on Earth Thousand Years amen so in Acts chapter 1 when they therefore will come together all the apostles they asked him saying God will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel he says I'm going I'll come back the same way you see me go is the same way I'm going to come when they asked about the kingdom you might think like he didn't understand them he understood them but he pointed them to the B of the Holy Ghost in because the B of the Holy Ghost is the creation of the Messianic Kingdom he's saying that my intention is here my intention is here it's not on the political Kingdom I'm going to build the kingdom Out of You by the bom of the Holy Ghost so then immediately he takes them to verse eight and he says but ye shall receive power after that the Holocaust has come upon you and it shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Juda and in Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth so the witness comes by the bosom of the Hool ghost that's God revealing himself to you then having the preeminence and once he takes the preeminence the life you live by the B of the Holy Ghost becomes your testimony are you together with me the life we live by the Holy Ghost taking preeminence is the testimony of the kingom praise the Lord so the Bas the Holy Ghost places us into Messianic Kingdom they asked about the natural Kingdom and in he gave them the Holy Ghost to B them into a different nature of Kingdom so let's go to the book of St Luke chapter 17 verse 20 says and when he was demanded of the [Music] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say la here or La there behold the kingdom of God is within you praise the Lord the kingdom of God is within you praise the Lord amen Christ is being specific I see kids on the other side I don't whether there is anybody taking care amen Christ is being specific he's saying that there cannot be AAL Kingdom amen without first the holy ghost coming into the hearts of men and prepare them first so the Holy Ghost comes to prepare us for the miranium which is a thousand year rule but at this time listen to me he says I first of all build the kingdom within you first first it has to be the kingdom of the B of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost therefore baptizes you into kingdom are you together with me when you receive the B of the Holy Ghost you are baptized into the [Music] kingdom we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved when all these worldly kingdoms are falling and the whole world is falling we are baptized into the kingdom that cannot be M we receive a kingdom and this kingdom is the mystical Body of Christ amen and the life of this kingdom is Christ in you the hope of glory that's the kingdom Paul says when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall he appear with him in glory somebody say Amen there amen now you're there praise the Lord he says Christ in you the hope of glory that's the kingdom show us the kingdom says the kingdom is in you because the king came into your soul by the B of the Holy Ghost where the king is he controls the kingdom brother Bram says like I was talking to some people they said well what church you belong to I said I don't belong what denomination you belong to I said nine said well what do you belong to I said a kingdom are you together with me do you belong to a kingdom here amen a kingdom and by one Spirit we are baptized into that kingom by one spirit all into this Kingdom Jesus say pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven amen then the kingdom is built in you amen the Holy Ghost baptizing us into the kingdom and therefore if the Holocaust baptizes us into Kingdom we must learn to live as a kingdom are you together with me we must learn to live as a kingdom the Holy Ghost cannot baptize you into isolation no sir the Holy Ghost baptizes into a kingdom you become a part of the Kingdom praise God listen to what the prophet says now in the Old Testament the know church was called the kingdom of God God's kingdom that's Israel that was the church as as Steven says the church in the wilderness because the church means a people that have been called out into something else you have been called out from all forms of unbelief and we have come into the world to make a word Kingdom amen so I'm taking this from chronology of the Bible brother Bram say the Old Testament the church was called the kingdom of God in other words God is a king and the church is his domain God's kingdom amen the church is his domain amen so when we are under King we must learn to live as a kingdom amen you see the church is the people of God that have been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom so you get into the kingdom you are saying Lord show me my position in the body of the Kingdom what am I going to do am I a prayer Warrior am I here to show sympathy let me help people let me go and pray with the Brethren who are sick what's my position in the body yes sir because because in the Kingdom everybody has something to do you know people want to go to a heaven where they are not going to do anything there you are going to be there for only three and a half years after that you will come back here and you are going to live a life and you going going to be subject as a kingdom let me tell you friends this Redemption is the restoration of where Adam fell from Adam tended the world the Earth we are coming back to that and I'm praying that God gives me the best spot in the [Music] millenum are you together with me yeah because we are being restored to Adam before the [Music] fall that's why there is an earth to Tender for some of you are saying go and study brother bram's message things that are to be things that are to [Music] be praise the Lord so the church is a people of God that's been called out of the world in another kingdom we must be doing something for the Lord you don't just come down here and enjoy the preaching of the pastor and then you go home and you say thank God that was good preaching you are called to serve in the kingdom and those are the things we shall keep going through listen to what he says now Israel was the people of God until that then they were called The Church of God when they were called out because they were called by God out of Egypt out of of the world away from other churches out away from other religions to walk with God alone and now the Church of God today is the same thing called out of everything of the world called out of every religious C out of every religious denomination out of every religious organization with God not being governed by a bishop but being governed by Christ in this Messianic Kingdom that we live in Christ is the king Christ is the word now Christ is the head of this Messianic Kingdom and you cannot organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head you cannot to denominate the kingdom which Christ is the head hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we come out everything we come out of our drugs we come out of our drinking we come out of for teaching to come in here not to continue but to get under the control and Leadership of Jehovah God Amen to Humble ourselves like a eel I went down to my face the Arrogant Spirits not have a place in the Messianic Kingdom because that means God does not have PR [Music] yet Israel is the Shad of this Messianic Kingdom listen to some of the facts Israel was called out and God was in [Music] their and Israel was not one tribe no sir every Tri [Music] had pointing to their position in the body Judah had the answer of a lion of the tribe of Judah showing he was the king every Tri was given some families to lead them you see when we come to make this Messianic Kingdom we are subjecting ourselves to the institutions that God has ordained in the church are you there amen you see like I say Israel was not one tribe it was a nation of 12 tribes so this Kingdom Here cannot be one local church no sir it's is many churches but they have been baptized into this Messianic Kingdom Hallelujah and the tribe was not one person but many people are you together with me when we come to church we are not one we are many people but every one of us has a position in the body of Christ and when Christ said the kingdom is within you he meant that this baptism must place you into a body of Believers for service you are not baptized in isolation are you together with with me we are baptized into the kingdom when he says that kingdom is within you he was not talking about one man he was talking about the body of believer the kingdom is within you so when the Hool ghost baptizes as an individual he brings you into body amen amen amen the Messianic kingdom is God putting his bread together throughout the seven Church ages to work a work where you would have preeminence in them before taking them back into a because that's the third fa to walk his bright back so he had that secret mystery yeah had that secret mystery he had it from before the foundation of the world that I will reveal myself and then preeminence in men when they have fallen then I will redeem them and walk them back into Ed are you together with me the threefold mystery amen amen so in the New Testament God reveals himself by manifestation if God Is On th side makes himself no amen this life here manifest certain different virtues to reflect the presence of Jehovah you have standing Faith amen you are not wavering your faith is not controlled by circumstances brother so and so has done this so I'm going away from the church no sir you have got a standing Faith Upon This Rock I build my church and the gifts of Hell cannot Prevail against standing Revelation amen and out of that fa there proceedeth virtue praise God Amen because what you believe is not dead knowledge but it has a life the word revealed has life in itself and proceed as knowledge which is holy ghost knowledge praise God you begin to understand things according to what God desires you to know out of that then proceed as Temperance man's Faith his faith will produce V Hallelujah that V will produce knowledge and that knowledge we help you to to stand with Temperance in times when you are second hallelujah hallelujah you will have Holy Ghost tempers praise God when bad times come you s your temple with prayer that means God has already taken resence in the kingdom and God is governing Hallelujah because in the New Testament God wants to reveal himself by manifestation not I've seen a light here all I've been shaking here the New Testament quer are you together with me in the Kingdom God reveals himself amen so God gives the Revelation to John so that he could show it unto God's servants and this Revelation is not the simple knowledge that Jesus is God no sir this Revelation here is God revealing by manifestation amen if he has revealed himself to you where's the preeminence that should always be our question and we should always desire to come to the ultimate and be able to manifest the presence of God in his kingdom amen you remember that black fellow he says I not what I want to be but I thank God I'm not what I used to be there is something working in you you may not be so much aware but I know God is working a work amen he has kept you under his word one year two years 5 years 10 years he's doing a work and one of these days praise God you are going to come to the stat amen of the Lord Jesus Christ praise God so this Revelation deals with God revealing his person amen together with his words in the journe of the seven Church ages that's what brother Bram told us in the seven Church ages that this Revelation here is not just the revelation of the person but it's the revelation of the person and his works in the church praise God are you together with me so in the New Testament God reveals himself by manifestation and that's why the scripture says John bear the testimony yet we amen of the person of Christ and his work praise God let us go there a little bit into the Book of Revelation chapter one are you together my friends yes sir so the Book of Revelation chapter one see what the holy spirit says here and verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto joh to show unto his servants things that must be which must shortly come to pass and John by a record amen a record like he's lifting something to the people amen he bear a record of this testimony John John the seven churches that the testimony is life he was not sing Doctrine it was more than that are you together with me the first thing that God wanted to reveal was to reveal himself to the people and he say hey I am Alpha and Omega but if that is revealed to you by Revelation he will always have the preeminence God reveals himself for the purpose of gain preeminence and when God revealed himself to the Church of Rome and they denied him preeminence God gave them up to a reprobate mind you may still be bearing certain weaknesses but don't dismiss Christ out of your life be like David Psalms 51 restore unto me the joy of your salvation amen the First Church of Rome when he was revealed to them they rejected him to have the preeminence the first F must the second FL if it's not so then he gives you up to reprobate mind so Romans 1:21 I'm trying to get out of here I agreed with my wife that I will not be preaching for so long she's worried I'm dying very fast Romans 1:21 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God the first four god making himself known to the people and that should take you to the second floor that Lord I Thank you you've revealed yourself to me you have helped me Lord to repent my now have the preeminence but the Romans the First Church of Rome they denied him preeminence and then he gave them up because they glorified him not as God he must have preeminence in our lives there are certain things that are not negotiable like when there's an assembly of the Saints you don't negotiate that you say no I'll see you after church sometimes we don't glorify him as God we don't give him his position neither are we thankful sometimes that God has chosen You by Grace you gave him nothing but Grace picked you up Paul says they were never thankful therefore they became vain in their imaginations and you find a brother like what happened to him he is vain in his imagination and the Foolish Heart Is darkened if God can't he walks away as the light of your life and darkness strikes your mind together with me here okay let's go to Romans 16 verse 25 and find out where we can put this down amen amen now him that is power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ which is based on the revelation of the mystery which was kept secr since the world began hallelujah hallelujah that's the foundation of the Gospel that God would reveal himself and then he will have prein that's the foundation of the Gospel According to the revelation of the mystery which was kept sacred since the world began now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith so that God could have prein so the the mystery secret is revealed to us for The Obedience of faith will you always obey the word amen and the purpose is to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in a people so the Revelation comes with manifestations of divine Authority and control are you together with me that may have prein that he may live among his people that's why at the end of it is going to be Revelation 21 new world and the new Heavens God in his own Tabernacle now let me just show you something here when the disciples were coming back from their mission joury Jesus asked them a question whom do men said that I the son of man they all reported what they had on the field some say that you are join the Baptist some elas and others Jeremiah and others one of the prophets then he asked them another question say that I [Music] am are you together with me in Matthew 1616 Simon answered and say thou art the Christ the son of the living Christ the Living God meaning that th at the fullness of the godhead settled in a human body because the son is the holy spirit in a body that's what son means son doesn't mean Mary's Boy because how can I become a Son of God I become a son by a baptism of of that great spirit so when Peter says Thou Art the Christ means that you are the f [Music] of the goded Bly verse 17 listen and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed th Simon for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven flesh and blood cannot reveal it listen friends I can teach it but I can't reveal it it's only the holy ghost that can reveal it you may come to church to hear me that's very wonderful but I can never reveal it Jesus spoke many things and the people heard and then they always asked questions the disciples would take him aside what do you mean about the seed in a good ground sometimes we come to church and we hear but we should always ask God to reveal it we should always ask God to open up the first fold to understand that godhood of Jesus by Revelation and the moment it comes by revelation it changes our thinking it changes our relationship to one another it SE us to be friendship and it becomes a Brotherhood the Brotherhood is that c and that's the son of God listen so therefore there is no school no theologians no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it is impossible for them to to know anything about it listen now God has he the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else it is a personal individual affair with the person [Music] that Christ is revealed to them and if you say it's been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong Revelation together with me here it must be a divine revelation let's continue here in verse 18 Matthew 16 now Peter has received the revelation and immediately God begins to speak to you I want you to understand this church are your ears open I want somebody to say Amen Peter catches the Revelation but after that Peter has different ups and downs ups and downs now sometimes we may think that when God reveals himself to you you will never make a mistake in your life but that's not true when he reveals himself to you you'll be obedient to the word that even when you have committed something you have done something wrong that voice will come and you will say Amen you are never tired of the altar you just keep saying Lord I must father that's not what I want to be I want to be a better person and I believe that's the desire of everybody amen so and I say unto thee thou Peter Hallelujah I have changed your name I have changed your character and now you are growing into Peter are you together with me you know the name towards the character so God gives him a name here and then he begins to grow into it he gives Abraham a new name and Sarah a new name and they begin to grow into it Hallelujah will you grow into your new name yes sir until you manifest the stch of a perfect amen now th art Peter you may stuggle but you've got a focus thank God that you've got a focus you know what you want to be and God will help you to that amen and he says Upon This Rock of Revelation I build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it upon the rock of revelation of what Christ I build my church Hallelujah am and the gates of will not Prevail against praise God yes sir God has decided upon the Revelation which has kept to you coming here which is the revelation of Christ is going to build you into a church is going to build you into a stone that is going to be placed at a certain point in this Tabernacle Hallelujah you are a part of the Messianic Kingdom amen so this Revelation amen verse 19 it says and not only name but something more than I'll give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom and whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou sh lose on Earth shall be loed in heaven this Revelation gives you a new name and gives you the Keys of the Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom is within you you have the keys every one of you has keys to this Kingdom to this Messianic Kingdom by the BM of the Holy Spirit and you are under the Divine authority to bind and to lose to bind and to lose you are going in the wrong direction you bind it by the way Jesus bound Satan it is written is bow Hallelujah and then you can lose if the devil is chaining you you will say it's written the chains will fall back in the Kingdom the Bible says the kingdom is within you when Jesus rose from the dead remember he had on his side the keys of death and hell but not the Keys of the Kingdom because that was given to the church amen you have the Keys of the Kingdom amen you can open for the people yes sir you can open for your friends by where you live your life hallelujah praise God you can invite them to church
