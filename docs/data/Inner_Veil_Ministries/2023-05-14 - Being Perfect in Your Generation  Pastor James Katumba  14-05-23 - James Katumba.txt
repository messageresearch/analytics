part of the members of the church in the early 90s I think those are over 30 years ago now let us stand up to our Bibles let us offer the word of prayer father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we want to thank you for this morning for your love grace and mercy your goodness Lord upon us you said we are taught three are gathered in your name and Lord we believe you are here in our meeting if you also promised in your words they shall be told of the Lord how great shall be their peace we pray Lord you may teach us through your words that has been smitten foreign let us go to Genesis chapter six and then we read from verse 1 to verse 9. the Bible says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth uh and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wise of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renowned foods and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually um and it repented the Lord that he had made man on Earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy my and whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the Falls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them guarantee okay but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just and perfect man in his generation and walked and Noah walked with God no ways amen amen so this morning by the grace of God I want to pretend being perfect in your generation being perfect in your generation so the Bible has told us that no one was perfect in his generation praise the name of our Lord no one was perfect in his generation and then the Bible says that Noah walked with God praise the name of Allah and also if we want to be perfect in our generation we need to walk with God but now here we are living in a time that we don't only walk with God but God walks in Us Praise the name of Allah foreign Enoch walked with God and then the Bible says and the Enoch was not found because he was not praise the name of Allah but he walked with God and then it pleased God to take Enoch to heaven in the days of Noah Noah walked with God and then it pleased to secure the lives of Noah and his family from the flags but then we have a greater testimony those people in the Old Testament we are living under the blood of animals then we in the New Testament we live in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so we have a greater witness we have a greater testimony now in second Corinthians chapter six the Bible says Bible cover and then verse 16. and what agreement has the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people um so the Bible is telling us we are the Temple of the Living God we are the house of God we are the building of God and so God desires to dwell in us the way he desired to walk with energy then you are going to be perfect foreign [Music] [Music] when the sins is also increase depression is also increase we are living in the days then the interactions increase praise the name of us so you find that you know depressions were so high yeah and then the Bible says [Music] now the sons of God where the children that were coming from Adam the line of others is what the Bible calls the sons because Adam was a Son of God so the people came from Adam they became the children of God and now the sons of God we are meant to marry the daughters of God praise the name of us the sons of God they are meant to marry from the daughters of you know like somebody marrying from outside they were not meant to marry from another line the people of God Were Meant to marry from among the people of God but now the people of God started going out but just like maybe what a brother or sister would do she wants to get a husband she just goes out the people who don't believe in Christ let us go good First Corinthians praise the name of Allah First Corinthians chapter seven chapter 7 and verse 39. the Bible says the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord um so the Bible says in [Music] you need to get from the Lord you need to marry a daughter of God you need to marry a Son of God praise the name of it and then if you want to get a right wife you want to get the right husband you yourself as an individual you need to be right with God first praise the name of our Lord if you are not right with God you will not get the right person foreign how did I get you you know what the Bible says they will deceive and they will also be deceived so you deceive here then you get a smarter person yeah so you need to check your ways praise the name of Allah if you want to get the daughter of God be a Son of God you want to be a Son of God you want to get a Son of God be a daughter of God and then the Lord will bring the right person so we see that in the days of Noah you know they were doing things they had challenges in marriage praise the name of our Lord and then now we sit still in the days of Noah there was an increase in the beauty of women we see the same thing today so these are precious and the Bible says in Luke chapter 17. foreign so if you want to know what is going to happen in our generation then you go to the days of Noah and then you see what happened in the days there were increase of people there was increase in the beauty of women there was you know people marrying from different things which they are not meant to marry people are decreased and then the Bible says violence increased on us see what has happened every week they are killing somebody innocence and you start wondering where is the world going because you're speaking bad about him see the madness they get somebody who has stolen a chicken and then they burn the person where is that coming from Days of Noah so the violence is so high that people don't have concerns they don't have natural affection for one another they don't have a feeling foreign you go back where is he going to take all that money oh you hear things somebody goes in a place and he chases away all the people and then he grabs hundreds of Acres going to grow their food from you see we are living in the days that people don't care about one another no more feeling for one another some days like it was in the days and then God said my spirit we are not Strife with man I am going to destroy the man that I've met praise the name of us but the Bible tells us in the midst of all the chaos in the days of Noah you have found favor before God praise the name of us in the minister of the chaos to come and dwell in your house and if the Holy Spirit has not been pleased to dwell in your heart then you need to seek the Holy Spirit and say Lord come down because you cannot overcome the pressures we have functions without the spirit of God you need the spirit of God overcome the challenges you need the spirit of God to overcome the generation of pressures that we see every other day on social media social media praise the name of Allah Facebook what's up what's up Twitter Instagram Instagram and they are now endless they are those from West Africa there are those from China then India India I don't know what is coming from Uganda foreign [Music] as it was in the days of Lords well we've read in Luke chapter 17. and then verse 28. as it was in the days look what the homosexuality the pressure that's a lover everywhere and it is taking over praise the name of Allah yesterday I was listening to some lady who is really fighting homosexuality and then you feel so bad praise the name of Allah but these are things that are happening in the developed world they are doing it and to them it is normal and then they are putting pressure on us praise the name of our Lord and these people don't have anything like reason or logic they want to force their thing on you when they were forcing it on Angels Genesis chapter 19. the first angels foreign to withstand such things to allow such things let us go to this message praise the name of our Lord in the message the Queen of Sheba mobile the prophet says let us got the message calling Jesus on the scene now while speaking commenting talking of him about what great things he had done after Revival fisting Jesus was probably resting like he is yes resting between revivals and they had been so clear identified to who he was the people knew who he was of those who he was blinding um but those who had a hold on the scripture because they knew what they knew that the scripture God's word has been given a lot you know to each every generation and that promise of that age has to be fulfilled and he fulfilled exactly what was supposed to be done in the time of the Messiah he met every qualification then we he was assured that he was the man now you see her brother Branham says that there is a lot there is a portion of the word of God that has been given to every generation praise the name of Allah even our generation there is a lot there is a portion of the word there is a the grace that God gives us to overcome the pressures that were living now if we can now get the word that has been sent in our generation then we are able to overcome in our generation we are able to be perfect in our generation when we can get the word that God has is allotted foreign but God has given us the message God has given us the message of the hour the revealed word of the time and that's the message that we need to live upright in this generation that's the message that we need praise the name of our Lord to overcome all the pressures so you need to make sure that you take time yourself standing the message that you have been here listen to the tips that we have what it is like I remember brother my love when I just got there University in my past year right now University he was of a great help to me yeah I know he was residing near Mercury University and every evening I would go to his home and when I was studying you know we didn't have many message books but I made sure that I go and borrow books from here check this message sometimes you find you don't want to lose the message you go and photocopy it oh yeah I remember I have many message books I photocoped and then I write down some of these things then I take it back to them how about us praise the name of Allah here we have message messages in book form we want to renewable we have them on our phones we have them on our iPads on our laptops how much time [Music] do you put in the message you know but now you find somebody he's given a church age and it takes two years he has not finished this one we gave a church and then I was asking hey how many Church ages are in the book I think they are nine but the book said seven churches what is the first church think revelation of Jesus Christ then has that person read the books so is it a generation that we are living here is that people have tests for different things but if we don't invest our lives in the message that we have been given how are you going to know the workings of Satan how will you get the grace of God upon your life how are you going to overcome how are you going to be perfect in this generation I was reading about the generations according to the understanding of the world and it is very interesting how they wrote it so they were talking about that right now we are living in a generation Alpha today the previous one Global was Generation Z while you're moving and they called it I Generations people just care about themselves a centennial Generation Um and then before that one the Centurion this generation is it the one before that one was Generation Y or so why people were born from 1980 to around 1994. I don't know that they were asking why then there was Generation X then there was baby boomer generation and then there was a traditionalist generation and it was silent and so you see that science the world in its understanding every Generations have been changing they categorize a certain group of people and now the generation we are living even the little children now now to use the phone but I went the university without a smartphone is a smartphone and finish without a smartphone and this one which had buttons at that time wants to get it from um and they know where to foreign Revival in every generation he gives the opportunity for people to come to him so we cannot write up the people of this day that because they are failing in this still there is the elect of God in the midst of the pressures now in the message the queen of shebang the prophet says but then when he did that Spanish it usually blinds those who are blinded to those things it makes them worse but in every generation God has always had these agents praise the name of Allah his name is foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] God always [Music] if God is think about things that are wrong if God is in here you desire the things that are pleasing to God praise the name of Allah how can we overcome how can we live perfect in our generation no one walked with God and as long as he walked with God he was perfect in his generation and now today wants to walk in now and as long as God is we are obeying him today we are following him then we are living perfect in our generation we are living perfect in Our Generation by the grace of God that he gives us that should be our utmost desires no this is my name is but in every generation every Revival brings forth some prophets of God Prophet is a preacher true preacher on the world that stays with the world and brings forth a Revival that God has the elect out of the generation and in our generation God has sent us a prophet praise the name of us you know the Bible says as it was in the days and many times when we are looking at the days of Noah we look at the floods but we don't remember that there was a prophet in the days there was a prophet in the days of Noah the message of God that delivered the election in the days so if we are living in the days and we have a prophet we have a message from the destruction even the days of Lord there was also a prophets now if you know that we are living in the days of love the question is where is the prophet of that day praise the name of foreign now when you see in the days of foreign God revealed himself praise the name of our Lord let us go to Genesis chapter 18. Genesis chapter 18. and then we read from verse one to Summer the Bible says and the Lord appeared down to him in the planes of memory and his and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day foreign men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the 10th door and brought himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight past not away I pray thee from thy servant age is let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a muscle of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore you have come to your servant and they said so do as though Hast said praise the name of our Lord so we see here that God appeared foreign then Abraham received the Lord he blamed me I needed something and now Abraham Ibrahim made him God yeah and then God asked Abraham yeah and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife you know they came as strangers and then now they were sitting under the tree and then Sarah was in a tent behind them and then now they knew Sarah by name so God revealed himself to Abraham you know where is Sarah Sarah he descend and so also if it were living in vibrating and he declares your sickness foreign praise the name of our Lord and then we read in verse verse 38. then Jesus stand and saw them following and says unto them what seek ye they say unto him Rabbi which is to being interpreted Master where adrenal thought yes and he says unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour into never gamble Nevada one of the two which heard John speak followed him and Andrew was Andrew Simon Peter's brother foreign and sends unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ away yes and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he's saying though at Simon the son of Jonah Thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone so Simon comes to Jesus and then Jesus Jesus know your name but I even know your father praise the name of Allah and then he knows Us by name he calls us he knows us I pray there and the more you yield yourself to the world is the more you discover who you are before God he knows us so he was able to design yes morning and you are the son of Jonas praise the name of our Lord he was using the sign of the Messiah the way he told Abraham where is Sarah your wife the way he told Sarah why did you laugh praise the name of Allah so brother Brandon had the same gift so what was that gifting declaring it was declaring Christ being Among Us Praise the name of Allah it was the revealing of the son of man a woman they're revealing of Christ himself and we still have the same Christ amount working in our lives praise the name of our Lord to make us get into the stature of a perfect praise the name of Allah so the message that the Lord has given unto us if we can't believe it with all our eyes will make us get into the stage will make us be ready for the Rapture because the promise of our days is the Redemption of this [Music] is there anything good from you know open it praise the name of it now each and every one of us God has chosen us are you taking time to tell people about the message that God has given unto us tell them God has given us a message this is what the Lord Has Done In Our Generations let the people know what you believe what hope you are so Philip told us Jesus told him yes there is no guy in verse 47. Jesus coming unto him and says of him beholden is in whom there is nothing else Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called disease you are the Son of God you are the king of Israel praise the name of Allah have you found Christ you need to tell another person then say that we have got foreign to make the choices and we have read about Luke Chapter 17. which says as it was in the days of Noah the days of Noah had several challenges we have them now to foreign Luke 17 30. when that's Sean is revealed so the son of man our Lord Jesus Christ has been revealed in our day praise the name of Allah he has been revealed why could it be revealed so that we believe him we receive him praise the name of our Lord we become part of him that's why he has been revealed so that you become part of him so that he becomes your bridegroom he becomes the Lord of your life and as long as you can fully accept him then he changes your nature he delivers you from your weaknesses that's why he has been revealed to us in the midst of the pressures the same evils we are going foreign Revelations chapter 3 verse 14. praise the name of our Lord the Bible says and unto the angel of the Church of the auditions right this thing says the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God what is I Know Thy works that though at neither called nor hot I would though at called um so then because though at lukewarm neither come all the heart I will spew thee out of my mouth is [Music] praise the name of the Lord the Lord the time that we are living in the age that we're living the pressures of the day he says you are not cold you are not hot you have a form of godliness but you deny the power of it and then he says you testify I am rich I'm increased with God I have no need of nothing I know it's not that though outrageous Rich that's their testimony I don't need anything but then the spirit of God says you are rich you are miserable you are poor you are naked and worst of all you don't know the condition of the time the generation that we are living their testimony is a false testimony their worth is false words then saying I don't need anything is also false because it is as a state of Destruction but it's this time answering that it pleased God to send us a message we need to take Serious is Christ outside of your church is Christ outside of your heart is Christ outside of your temple Crystal you need to make sure that you get him back into your house if you don't get him into your house you'll be counted with the people of rejected we are living in a terrible time and then the Bible says praise the name of our Lord in second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1. this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come together in the last two days the time that we're living in the Bible is telling us dangerous times you see what's happening violence killing one another no more concern about anybody people not caring foreign proud about famous disobedient to parents I'm thankful these same spirits that are in the world they also put pressure on us they also come down the currency and put a lot of weight on us praise the name of it men shall be lovers of their own selves the generation we're living in the age that we're living the time that we're living start asking yourself how about me I use so much of a lover of your own self until you don't care about one another wounded but this is the time we're living in praise the name of our Lord you know somebody now there's nothing wrong with taking a child to an expensive schools but now somebody close to you tells you please help me he's spending two millions for a child in nursery and deserving somebody close to him the child are not going to say please help me with twenty thousand foreign lovers of themselves don't care for you it's it's the world we're living and then he says you know they convert after what is not theirs like now sometimes you find a rich man he's having a mile a mile of land now when he's doing it he all the roads under his title he makes sure it passes through the home of a poor person you can't lose one inch to the road does come and break their house they don't care every time we're living Busters you know like I was told that in Western Uganda interior Western Uganda some of these rich men they go and start bragging how many heels they have me I have 20 Hills what is it helping you anyhow Busters proud you know like if anything happens they want to accuse God for that thing which has happened disobedient to parents children the Bible wants you to be obedient to your parents praise the name of Allah don't allow the spirits make you disobey your father or mother praise the name of us then the scripture again says you give him this and what you know says I don't want and the Bible says without natural affection somebody is Obed reading they don't care if you die you die how far away and then we hear what happens also in hospitals and then they say how many people have died when you die will it be new well now foreign chess backers false accusers you know and you see the devil understanding he makes you do something wrong and then he goes and that chooses you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and this is what the people do for them they do worse than what you're doing but they're the first people to start trumpeting we know we don't need to have this spirits we need to avoid the spirits of the end time we have been called prioritable praise the name of our Lord let us compare this with this is [Music] praise the name of Allah Ephesians chapter 4 verses and then we start from verse 23. and be renewed in the spirit foreign speak every man truth to his neighbor for we are members of one another angry and sin nuts the Sun go down let him that's tall still no more but rather let him walking with his hands the thing which is good that you may have to give to him that need this let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mind but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers are let all bitterness foreign let all bitterness and the anger no become way and clamor and he was speaking be put away from you with all malice now first second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 says because people have gone away from the Lord so now the evil spirits then get a place where they live they come and dwell in the bodies of people and now when they get habitation they cause people do things that are not right and you know one Spirit brings in other Spirits an evil spirits like now when you look what bitterness bitterness will bring in the spirit of rest and rest anger and now because you are angry then you shout then you start speaking evil you've opened up to this evil spirit it's the time that we're living here you know you get people becoming mad at one another they can't bear with one another they can't be kind to one another they are unforgiving they are not repentance the time we are living foreign [Music] leader praise the name of Allah the generation that we're living in um the pressures are so much but how do you overcome how do you become perfect in our generation in verse 32 of Ephesians chapter four and be a kind one to another yeah forgiving one another even as God for Christ is sake has forgiveness be kind to one another love one another praise the name of Allah you know Jesus Says by this shall all men know that you are my disciples or Desiring evil for your foreign introduces the cannot please about you rejoicing in another person being in trouble regardless when there is so bad when I saw evil God doesn't want that praise the name of Allah you need to be merciful you know say Lord Lord be gracious that's what we have been called today no we have not been called to think evil again but you know to wish each other put yourself in this condition will you be happy when they are laughing at you no you need to have natural affection the Bible says in verse three without natural affliction truth Breakers falsa choosers incontinent about again there is a fears despises of those that are good traitors lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God is having a form of godliness but denying the power there from such turn away since they have a form of godliness foreign let us go to John chapter seven praise the name of our Lord John chapter 7 and then verse 37. in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood on Christ saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink yes praise the name of our Lord praise the name of our Lord says if you thirst command what we know come to Christ and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters so you need to come to Christ in the midst of your weakness in the midst of your failure in the midst of your trespasses come to Christ the name of our Lord or if you are the end time Spirits evil spirits have taken a hold of him come to Christ and be delivered praise the name of Allah says come unto me you are heavy laden and I will give you rest so what you do don't rejoice in your bad condition launch but don't brag about your body condition but you need to call upon the name of the Lord I'm in this kind of conditions [Music] I hate my enemies I don't love my enemies [Music] when I hold my phone I'm watching that scene when I put you know pieces in my ears [Music] he says [Music] you know so you need to take a step and denounce the things that are evil praise the name let us go to Isaiah chapter 16. praise the name of our Lord Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1. the scripture says arise shine Glock of thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you [Music] um for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon you and give his glory shall be upon you is praise the name of Allah there is a promise of overcoming whatever condition you are in says Darkness the gross Darkness upon the people people are bound in sins arise and come out of your face the glory of the Lord God has wrote great things for us God has sent us the message and then you'll overcome your weaknesses all your trespasses [Music] there will just be nothing before but you need to come and drink something believe
