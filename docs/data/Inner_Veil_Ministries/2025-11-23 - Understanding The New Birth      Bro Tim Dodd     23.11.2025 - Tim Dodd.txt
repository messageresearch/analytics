[music] And I'm [singing] holding up my hand and praying for your [music and singing] grace. &gt;&gt; Won't you take it? &gt;&gt; Won't you [music and singing] take it? &gt;&gt; Lord, help me walk again. &gt;&gt; Take [music] over. &gt;&gt; Take [singing] over. &gt;&gt; Take over. [music] &gt;&gt; Take over. Let [singing] go. the [music] rain so you can leave. &gt;&gt; I'll move over. &gt;&gt; Move over.

Take our [singing] Lord and [music] realize I'm going wrong again. &gt;&gt; So take over. &gt;&gt; Take [music and singing] over. Bless you. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. That's the cry of the heart &gt;&gt; that take over the reigns. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Because I realize I'm going wrong again." You see, it's very important to always give ourselves into his leadership. We cannot lead ourselves. He's the shepherd of the flock. When you feel you are getting off the line, it's like a sheep just bleed out and the good shepherd will be on the spot. And I feel like he's saying tonight, I feel like he's saying tonight, stay in line. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that we don't go to the left, we don't go to the right, but we are watching the high mark of our calling. Amen. Amen. So we want to welcome the visitors among us. This is home over and over. &gt;&gt; We appreciate having you when we have meetings here. Amen. Amen. And more so we appreciate friends like brother Tim who have us at heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See for a man to make a decision to go. You were not only on his you know thinking but right deep down in his heart. So there is a pull that keeps bringing him here. We don't take you for granted. Amen. There is a connection and we honestly appreciate the ministry of brother Tim. Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes us a level higher than where he finds us. Are you ready to feed on the word? Amen. Let's stand up and just give the Lord a hand of praise. Our brother steps over. [applause] [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, we are on. &gt;&gt; Yours is all right. God bless you. Greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be in the house of the Lord? [applause] I ask you another question. Are you glad to be part of the bride of Jesus Christ? Amen. We are privileged people. Have your seats for a moment. This year has been a year of change for brother Tim. You may have heard I was in South Africa for five and a half months. I won't get into the details of that. I'll just say the Lord used it. I was actually going to visit here from South Africa, but then I canled with brother Steven. I wanted to concentrate my efforts in South Africa. &gt;&gt; Now we're back in Canada. &gt;&gt; There's some changes coming there. But I want to thank brother Steven for the opportunity. Thank brother James for opening the pulpit. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Last time I was here, Father Steven said, "This is my second home." Uh, brother. Always a pleasure to be here. &gt;&gt; Now remember, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, &gt;&gt; they are spirit and they are life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You want to change something here? All right. &gt;&gt; You get it? Just microphone is tangled. If I can untangle the microphone, &gt;&gt; maybe we can untangle the word. It's only men that tangle things up. &gt;&gt; God does not tangle things up. Amen. Amen. But Jesus, as I was saying, Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. Why are they spirit and life? Because they're God's words. God's words have creative power. Therefore, if God puts thoughts in this mind and they're spoken through these lips, they go from thought to word. then they're not the words of a man. If they're not the thoughts of a man, but if they're the thoughts of God, then they are the word of God. Amen. Amen. I was in a service in Cloverdale and I uh was preaching. I was preaching and I I felt led to the subject of the woman with the blood issue. And while I it was not in my notes, but God put the thoughts in my mind. And while I begin to speak on the woman with the blood issue, there was a woman in the congregation who had a blood issue for several months and she told me later, "Brother Tim, when you spoke about the woman, God touched me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't touch her, &gt;&gt; but the word is spirit and life. &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, you pull on God. Now, she still had some pain, but she said it'll go away. &gt;&gt; But it didn't go away. And so a couple weeks later, she came for prayer. But she said to the Lord, "I want brother Tim to pray for me." And I didn't know anything about the situation. And I was standing with another brother getting ready to pray for another sister. And I saw this woman come up with her, I think it was her daughter. And I said to the brother that was with me, &gt;&gt; I said, "Here, you pray for this woman. I'll go pray for this sister." Now remember, that was her request. That was her request, not to me, to God. And so as I prayed for her, the Lord came down and took away her pain. Now the testimony doesn't end there. When I was in South Africa, I was sharing the testimony in the church to encourage the people to believe and while I was sharing the testimony, a woman in the church, she turned to her husband. She said, "Something just happened. She was healed. of the same blood issue. Hallelujah. Amen. And then I went to Ethiopia and I shared the testimony and a woman let out a scream. She also had a blood issue. God healed her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She has no more trouble. &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; The power of the word of this end time message is unlimited. All that you have need of, if you believe, all things are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's stand together. Take our Bibles and turn to the book of Ezekiel, chapter 36. as to [clears throat] it refused. Can I help you? &gt;&gt; I got it finally. It's only in this church that I have trouble unwrapping a bottle. &gt;&gt; [laughter] [laughter] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven said, "We broke the seal." &gt;&gt; Brother, amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer before We're so glad to be here this morning with you. All things are possible. This is not a natural gathering. It's a supernatural gathering. We are gathered in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I'm just a man. Whatever gift there is in [snorts] me, you put it there. I pray that you'd help the man to get out of the way that you could use the gift that you put in there. &gt;&gt; And I pray the same for brother Emanuel. I pray the same for your people. Help us to yield our humanity to you that you might move in our lives on a supernatural plane. &gt;&gt; Father, you know every need. There's no secrets from you. Direct this service the way you want it. Father, we yield oursel to you. in Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 36. Now, we're going to take a subject this morning of understanding the new birth. And we have some slides for you. You can go ahead and and start the slideshow. And I think the first slide is just the title. Now watch in Ezekiel 36 here. Verse 24. For I will take you from among your heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land. So the very first verse he's talking about inheritance. So what he's talking about here as we get into the new birth is connected to your inheritance. Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean. From all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. Now in verse 26 here, he's not talking about four different things. He's talking about one process and things that will take place within that process. Verse 27. And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments and do them. So, he's speaking about a new covenant. All right? And he says, "I'll put my spirit in you." And and is a conjunction. It connects it together. And I will cause you to walk in my statute. He's not talking two different things. I give you my spirit. My spirit in you will cause you to walk in my statutes. All right? Because previously they only walked in God's statutes by the law. So he's talking about taking the church from law to grace and then under grace he gives us his spirit to cause us to walk in his statutes. Verse 28. And you shall dwell in the land that I gave your fathers. There's inheritance. And you shall be my people and I will be your God. So by this process called the new birth, I will cause you to possess your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord add his blessing to the word you may not see. All right. Now, today we're going to spend some time and we'll the two services will be connected and our purpose is to dig into the message because all the answers are in the message. the things that will help us in our daytoday battle. Anybody in a battle? Anyone in a battle? Are you in a battle? Amen. Only some of you. Amen. Brother Brown says when you're born again, that puts you in a battle. When when he referred to Israel going into the promised land that represented the Holy Ghost, it did not represent the millennium because there was wars and fightings in the land. that but they had to fight to possess their land. How many want to possess your land? How many are sons and daughters of God? This civilization is not your land. Your land is what is described in the title deed. And all the answers you need are contained within the message of the hour. God has spoken to this generation, the last church age, the bride of Jesus Christ. through the mouth of a prophet. I'll give you everything you need to possess your land. Amen. Amen. It's the entirety of the message. It spans seven church ages. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, all the mystery of God would be finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery of who you are in Christ Jesus. For Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I I don't see a slideshow here. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. If you're ready. All right. Just click F5. Whatever. Let's roll. Ah, that's going to be hard to see. Next slide. &gt;&gt; All right. Romans 12 and verse one. And I want you to catch this now. &gt;&gt; Says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just waiting for the interrupter here, interpreter here. [laughter] All right. But what does bodies have to do with it? We're not under the law. We're under grace. But now we cannot fulfill the word by our body. But we must present our bodies a living sacrifice. It's our reasonable service. Some interpretations say it is our spiritual worship. So you present your bodies to God as a sacrifice in worship unto him. &gt;&gt; The next verse, &gt;&gt; be not conformed to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Now we've gone from the body to the mind. The mind is the spirit. All right? So there has to be a renewing of our mind or a new mind or as Ezekiel calls it a new spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. So it's not the old spirit. I let me rephrase that. It's a different spirit, &gt;&gt; but it is a renewed spirit. &gt;&gt; The renewing of our minds click. &gt;&gt; All right. In the Smyrnian church age, see, now you clicked twice, didn't you? See, I didn't say click twice. You stay with me, Brother Henry. Don't get ahead of me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] He says, "Now in the Smyrnian church age, brother Brandham describes the birth." He says, "Now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos God was was manifest in the sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son. Let me read that again. That eternal one, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son. Now I asked you already, how many sons and daughters of God are here? And you put your hand up. All right. How do you gain the title of son or daughter? It must be the father manifest in flesh. Because brother Brandham goes on. And he says, "Even so we &gt;&gt; eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh. And those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God. Even as we are so called. &gt;&gt; Can you put your name there? Can you say amen to that? You were a thought of God. That thought is now materialized into All right, let's go to the next one. Is a continuation of the same quote. We did not become seed by the rebirth. We were seed. Somebody say amen. Therefore, we're reborn. For only the elect can be reborn. &gt;&gt; Because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened. In nonseed there is nothing to quicken. You had to be a thought. The thought was materialized and the word for the hour came to you and quicken that part of God in you. You didn't know anything about it quickened you. The elect of the hour, the seed that is supposed to manifest in that season are quickened by the message of the hour. Let me let me comment. Hallelujah. Amen. Next, Henry. &gt;&gt; I'll just say your name. Every time I say your name, you just give me a click. &gt;&gt; All right. Henry. &gt;&gt; Now, we all have a body. Henry. Oh, some of our bodies look like this. &gt;&gt; Henry. Henry. But when we were younger, they used to look like this. But we all have a body. Henry. Henry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a next there's something else there. Just beside the body, you are not your body behind the body. Henry, there's something else. There's a spirit. Now, the spirit, we don't know the form, but it's the record of your life. &gt;&gt; It's the record of your natural life. I like to like to your page in the book of life. Amen. It records your actions and sometimes those are not good actions. But brother Brandham said, "If there's something wrong with you, I contact your spirit." Somehow it's recorded there. It doesn't contact your flesh, &gt;&gt; but it's recorded in your spirit. And we'll go into this more as time goes on. And inside of that is a soul and in that soul is a seed gene. If you are an elect of God, we don't know really the form of the soul, but that is the real you. In some places, brother Brandham says the soul is the seed gene. &gt;&gt; And in some places, he says the seed is in the soul. It doesn't make no difference. But the soul and the seed are tied together. So, you have a three-part body, Henry. Henry. Amen. Henry. Now, let's take a look at this body just for a minute. &gt;&gt; Because we pay so much attention to it that we really go too far. Now, in the in this body, if we magnify it up, Henry In this body are particles, molecules and you're made up of all &gt;&gt; molecules. &gt;&gt; Molecules. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Which are made up actually these are cells if I would call it this way. It doesn't really matter. These are pieces of your body. There's there's more than 50 trillion of these in your body. &gt;&gt; Henry &gt;&gt; Henry &gt;&gt; Henry inside of that is a DNA. There are 92 DNA in each cell. If we go further, these DNA is made up of atoms. &gt;&gt; There are 566 atoms in every DNA. 66 &gt;&gt; 566. Now, here we go. I'm going to challenge our inter interpreter here. There are seven billion billion billion atoms in your body. [laughter] everybody. That's what your body is made of. &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide, Henry. &gt;&gt; An one single atom. If we take the nucleus of the atom and and magnify it up to the size of a fly. The rest of the atom would be flying around the size of a stadium. [snorts] So much space in an atom. So now you're saying why are you even saying this brother? &gt;&gt; I want to show you how little your body means. So if you took all the space and put it all collapsed it all together, &gt;&gt; the nucleus and the electrons. Can you can you go there? [laughter] &gt;&gt; The particles. Let's call it that. take all the space out and just collapse. You could put the entire human race in a teaspoon. I'm saying I'm saying your body is a lot of nothing. What is holding all these parts together? The life inside of it. Amen. Amen. No matter no matter no matter how much science can look at your body your body will they will never find the life &gt;&gt; because the life is in the soul. You see, this is just a garment. &gt;&gt; And we're not even talking about the heavenly garment, the theophony. We're just explaining this body. All right. Now, remember this is real. But do you correctly interpret what your body is telling you? Are you seeing what you think you're seeing? Jonah called many things lying vanities. &gt;&gt; Jonah Jonah. &gt;&gt; Jonah. &gt;&gt; Jonah. See, there's many things you think you understand. You see them, you feel them, but your flesh could be lying to you. &gt;&gt; You see, you have to operate by the word of God alone. That's why brother Brandham even said stay with what's on the tapes. &gt;&gt; There's people down through the ages said, "Oh, I heard brother Brandham say this or I I heard him say that or he said this to me personally. Be careful. cuz you can be deceived. &gt;&gt; Stay with what's on the tank. All right. Next one. In 1 Corinthians 15 talking about the body, it says that which thou seest thou seest not that body that shall be but bear grain that it may chance of wheat or some other grain. It's talking about the body that pertains to the seedinthians 15. But God giveth it a body as it pleases him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is not the same flesh. But there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds. Now, what makes them different? It's right in the Bible. Brother said, "The soul controls the spirit. The spirit controls the body." Now remember when Nebuchadnezzar was lifted up in pride, God knocked God brought him down by taking the spirit of an animal and putting it on him. Now if you take the human spirit out, put an animal spirit in, then the body starts acting like an animal. Now his hair started growing like feathers. His fingernails like claws. And his taste buds begin to desire the grass of the ground. Why? His spirit changed. And the body had to line up with the spirit. That's why the Bible says, "The same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you will also quicken your mortal body. Not bring your body subject to humanity, but bring your body subject to the word because his spirit is the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God with God. Amen. So get his spirit. and by his stripes you were healed. Yet his spirit and he's your deliverer. He's your provider. He will bring this body subject to every divine cause. Don't let the devil tell you anything different. When you have the spirit of God, You have every promise. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Last verse. Verse 40. Here. There are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is one. The glory of terrestrial is another. Amen. We don't have time to go into that one. Henry forward. &gt;&gt; Henry. &gt;&gt; Henry. Amen. &gt;&gt; There we are. Matthew 26 and verse 40. And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and says to Peter, "What could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. You see, that's why we read the scripture already. Romans 12, I beseech you that you present your bodies a living sacrifice. Watch and pray. Amen. Next. Next. Henry. Romans 7 and verse 18. Paul describes the battle between the flesh and the spirit. For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. Now often times when I preach a couple weeks after youth camp And you know in camp it's a great presence of the Lord experiences with God. And then brother Tim gets up in the pull pit and says to the young people, I says, "But now you realize you have the same stinking flesh that you had before camp. same stinking flesh. Your body was not changed at camp. Your soul might have been changed. Your spirit might have been washed, but your flesh is your flesh. &gt;&gt; How many are born again? All right. Now, put your hand down. Now, how many of you your flesh is born again? See, that's what Nicodemus asked Jesus. How can a man be born again? Can he enter in a second time into his mother's womb and have a second natural birth? Jesus says, "How be it you're a leader in Israel and you don't understand this stuff. That which is born of flesh is flesh, but that which is born of the spirit is spirit." Now, brother Brandham says Paul here in Romans 7 is talking about a born again believer. For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. He say he goes on he says for the good that I would do not the good that I would do sorry the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now just a minute here brother is talking about a born again believer Amen. &gt;&gt; The evil which I would not that I do. I make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Why do you make mistakes? Cuz your body is not yet changed. &gt;&gt; Paul goes into it. He says, "Now if I do that, I would not. It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." Amen. Watch as he brings this out here. I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me. I am motivated to do good. That's God's nature in the soul. But evil is present. I delight in the law of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. Oh wretched man that I am. Oh, &gt;&gt; thou shalt deliver me from the body of this death. I tell you what, there's coming a body change. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. One day you will make your last mistake. One day you will be changed. So I cannot stand up here and condemn you for making a mistake. When brother Bradom says I make mistakes every day, He was talking about himself. He said, "I make mistakes." Why? Because the wretched body of sin that we dwell in. But we have a promise. We shall be changed. And even more than that, if the spirit of God dwells in us, It will bring this body subject to the word of God. For the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I could go into the next verse which is Romans 8. There is therefore now no condemnation. to them who walk after the spirit, not after the flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something, brother. The pastor can correct me after I'm gone. But as long as you're in this flesh, there will be times in your life in weakness and in deception you will get in the flesh. But we have a propitiation. We have a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Put it under the blood. If you fall, get up again. Repent of your mistake and move on with God. Amen. Amen. Henry. Amen. Oh, a &gt;&gt; Henry. Henry. &gt;&gt; There we go. Galatians 5:1 17. We'll wait for the interpreter here. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Galatians 5. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Galatians 5:1 17. Are you enjoying this this morning? &gt;&gt; It is fine. &gt;&gt; 5:1 17. For the flesh lusts against the spirit, the spirit against the flesh. That's the Holy Spirit, not your spirit. And these are contrary one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would. Verse seven. If you had a perfect body, you'd be in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that's what holds you here. It is. &gt;&gt; That's what holds you here is the sin of this body. As long as you live in a sinful body, you're bound in the sinful realm. But somebody just left their body yesterday. What was his name? You tell the people. What did he do? He laid his body down. He didn't lay down. &gt;&gt; He laid his body down without a sinful body to go to his reward. Now, he's not limited to the limits of a sinful body. If the Lord carries We will lay these bodies down. But I'm convinced that there are people right here in this room who will not taste death. I'm convinced that there are people who have receive the power of the resurrection and will receive a body change. in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; and they'll all of a sudden go from being bound by sin to being loosed, free, manifest entirely what it is to be a son of God. Hallelujah. That's what's inside of you. That's why. Oh, I'll better read the rest of the verse here. &gt;&gt; But if you be led of the spirit, you're not under the law. 18. Now the works of the flesh are manifest. Now, it doesn't say the works of the sons of God. Says the works of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is what lays in your body. W &gt;&gt; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, rellings, and such like. Go ahead. Oh no, brother Tim. I'm a believer. You are what? I'm a believer. I have been saved. My body doesn't do those things. Brother Brandham said, "If God take his hand off me, I would fall tomorrow because these things are laying in your flesh. But if the spirit of that raised up Christ from the dead, it will keep your body in subjection to Hallelujah. Because they which they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. that you shall inherit the kingdom of God. It is your inheritance. You see, you can probably tell by now that Brother Tim doesn't preach a legalistic message. &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, I'm not here to preach legalism. I'm here to preach the power of the blood. I'm here to preach the grace of God to the glory of his grace. Amen. Amen. That's what we have received in this hour. Because when you know who you are, you behave accordingly. All right. Brother Brandham talked about the slave in the field. &gt;&gt; Slave in America. They bought and sold slaves. The traders came by the farmer's field and they noticed this young man. He wasn't bent over and sad like everybody. He conducted himself differently. His head was up. His shoulders were back. He was a slave. As the farmer, what makes him different? Does he eat better? They said no. Does he have is he the boss of the slaves? Said no. What makes him different? the farmer said it's be I wondered it myself but one day I found out back where he's from his father is a king and he conducts himself as a son of a king now just a minute just a minute here a minute. Just give me a minute. What if he didn't know he was the son of a king? He would still be the son of a king. But because he didn't know, he would behave like everybody else. But because he knew who he [screaming] was, It caused his actions to be different. And that's what this message has come for, to show you who [screaming] you are, to cause you to recognize yourself. And then the bride recognizes who she is. [screaming] She becomes an invincible army. It doesn't change who you are. You always were a thought of this message. Show you [screaming] who you always were. You were quickened by this message. [screaming] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; the legalism in the message, do this, don't do that. You know, you act like this, you behave like this. Shame on you. You should be better than that. [screaming] Stop doing those things. We don't behave like that. and not of the world. [screaming] All of those things said that came from Pentecost. It's Pentecostalism creeping into the message, trying to tell you not to be bad. But that's not what the message is. The message is not just to show you you're sinners and you need to repent. But the seals came open. Show you your name under the seals. And when you see yourself in the earth, [screaming] Then you know those are works of the flesh and you present your body a living soul because you're a child of God. Hallelujah. [screaming] The word has come open not to show you who brother Brandham was. Not to show you who brother Tim is. Not to show you who brother Steven is. To show you who you are. Hallelujah. Message. [cheering] [applause] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, now Henry's getting caught up in the spirit. The &gt;&gt; You see in in the amplified version it says it this way. For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit and the desires of the spirit are opposed to the flesh. No, &gt;&gt; this is a different interpretation. Ah, just interpret it. Interpret these words. These are antagonistic to each other. See, I'm trying to show you what's going on in your life. If you weren't born again, there's no battle when you are not. Not when you're not born again. It's all unbelief. But when the nature of God comes in, the spirit wars against the flesh and the flesh wars against the snow. Who is your greatest enemy? Right here. Here's your greatest enemy flesh. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8. Here we come now. &gt;&gt; You can turn to it if you want to, Mr. Interpreter. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Romans 8, verse 11. Huh? But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. We've quoted it, but we'll read it for you. Go ahead. Therefore, brethren, therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to live after the fle or to the flesh, but to live, not to the flesh to live after the flesh. For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. But if you through the spirit do glorify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Amen. One. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now we move on. &gt;&gt; No, go back. I want a blank screen if possible. Go back. Oh, just there's no blank. Okay, just leave it there then. Sorry, Henry. All right. Now, the bo so your body is not the answer either positive or negative. you are saved or unsaved. You can impersonate all the motions of a believer like Judas did. He healed the sick, cast out devils and was lost, son of predition. But because we're born in the natural, there's a focus on the physical. And we teach our children when they're babies to fulfill the desires of the flesh. There's three things a baby needs. Food, sleep, clean diaper. If it has those, if it has those three things, it's happy. Is that right? All the mothers said, "Amen." Food, sleep, clean diaper. And when the baby's crying, we check those three things. Why? to satisfy the flesh, to keep the flesh happy. But when we come to the age of accountability, there's more. &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to I'm going to skip some things here, so stay with me. &gt;&gt; And again. And again. All right. Oh, Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. All right. Now, next one. This is out of Philippians 3. For we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus. and have no confidence in the flesh. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's I dealt a long time with that. And now I'm going to take the we're going to move forward here. &gt;&gt; The foundation is laid. Now remember Jesus in Luke 24 he walks on the road to Emmas and there he draws near to them. In verse 16 says their eyes were holden that they should not know him. and their eyes were opened and they knew him later on and he vanished out of their sight. That's when they said, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" So their eyes deceived them and then their eyes became open. Next clip and as they thus spake, this is later Jesus stood in their midst and he shows them his hands and his feet. Next one. &gt;&gt; And he says, "These are the words which I spake unto you when I was yet with you, all the things that were written in the law of Moses. [snorts] You see, you're on a journey. Sometimes you'll know what's happening. Sometimes you won't know what's happening. Sometimes your eyes will be closed and then Jesus will open your eyes. Sometimes you won't understand and then Jesus will open your understanding. Sometimes you won't see it in the Bible and then all of a sudden you'll see it in the Bible. You'll read a scripture, you don't understand it, and then God will open your understanding. Why? That's the way you're made. And there's a reason for that we're going to go into tonight. All right. Next. Now, Brother Brandham says, "Let me draw you a little circle. If I had a blackboard, I want you to watch here. I'm going to make one ring like this. I'm going to make another ring on the inside of that ring. That's two. And then I'm going to make a ring on the inside of that ring. That's three rings, three circles. Hang on. I have to go really fast. Now, that's you. That's God. God in a trinity is one. And without a trinity is not God. He can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the trinity person that you are. That's body, spirit, and soul. Without either one of them, you're not complete. Amen. All right, keep moving forward here. First click, there's your body. There's your spirit. Next click, there's your soul. Abraham says to draw three rings. &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul. &gt;&gt; Next click. The soul is you. &gt;&gt; All right. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So that's who you really are here. Next click. &gt;&gt; Now in your body. next click or sorry in your soul is unbelief. This is how you're born. But in the midst of that soul next click, there's a seed gene waiting to be quickened. This is every baby. This is every unredeemed person. That's an elect of God. All right, next click. One more. &gt;&gt; Okay. Not sure what happened there. Keep going. Next one. Oh, here we go. Now, Brother Brandham, in the message, leadership, he says, "You're either for God or against God. The outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside. And the cocoa may of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to heaven. No sir, you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Or he says that don't mean one thing, you're going to heaven. No sir, you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. And many people stumble over this quote because they don't read the next quote. And then brother round says right after this. Yeah. One more. He says, "Look here. You are an outside person. You have five. Go ahead. You have five senses that contacts the outside body. God gave you five senses not to contact him your earthly home. See, feel smelling here. Then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets. Conscience and love and so forth. Five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit. Your physical contacts the physical. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your spiritual contacts the spiritual. But inside of that you've got a soul. The soul is the gene that come from God. So now what brother is brother Brandham doing here? He's explaining how you can have the Holy Ghost and go to hell. And he breaks it down into the three parts that you are. Body, spirit, soul. So that's what we're going to do. Next one. Like a baby formed in its mother's womb. The baby comes to mother's womb. Little germ. It crawls into the egg. It doesn't form one cell. Human, dog, cat, horse. It's all human cells. All right. And when a man's been born again by the word of God, predestinated to eternal life called the elected, it'll be word of God on top of word, word on word. We're going to leave that there and move on. So here's your body, &gt;&gt; your spirit and your soul. &gt;&gt; In your body, you have five senses. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. In the spirit, you have five channels. But your soul is either faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, stay with me here. &gt;&gt; One click. In your spirit, you become deformed. The devil uses your imagination to create worry. Worry is worry is simply the misuse of imagination. Is the misuse misuse of imagination. You imagine things, you worry about them and they never happen. It's a perversion of your imagination. Next one you devil likes to take your reasoning and turn it into insanity or pride or other things. Now remember these channels were created by God. Brother says in greatest battle ever fought that these channels need to be cleaned out. &gt;&gt; Next one. Henry. All right. Then we con and your conscience can easily be moved by the devil into condemnation and legalism. And people's consciences become perverted. into legalistic ideas by the devil. Let me give you an example. I was preaching years ago at a men's meeting, 200 men with questions and answers. &gt;&gt; And someone wrote a question in said, "I I committed fornication before I was saved. Does that mean I cannot minister? Now you're all waiting on the edge of your seats. And I I told brother Barry Coffee who was running the meeting. I said, "Give me that question." &gt;&gt; Brother Barry Coffee. Okay. &gt;&gt; His name is Barry Coffee Coffee. &gt;&gt; The meeting was not being run on coffee. [laughter] I said, "Listen, if committing fornication means you cannot minister, no one has a right to minister." For Jesus said, "If a man look upon a woman to lust after her in his heart, he has committed adultery." I said, "So it's not the physical act. It's if you even thought wrong in your mind. And in this day and age where one of the problems of the age, the immorality of women, immorality, immorality. Tell me someone without the Holy Ghost that never lusted after a woman. Well, it's quiet in here. I guess I I stepped on an African doctrine here. &gt;&gt; I'll let brother Steven and brother James deal with that one. wants to take your conscience and form legalism with it. &gt;&gt; Because there's scriptures you can take and tie regarding fornication, adultery, women, harlots, different things, and tie it all together and say, "No, you can't minister. But now I know a prophet and I'm not I'm not making a doctrine out of this, okay? &gt;&gt; I know a prophet who helped a harlot in an insane institution get delivered and get the Holy Ghost. and he said about her, she would make a good minister's wife. &gt;&gt; Now, I've just given all kinds of problems to these brothers here [laughter] and I'll let them deal with it. But my point is channels in your spirit. &gt;&gt; The devil knows how to twist them up. &gt;&gt; He takes your affections and turns it to worship. Affection. Affections. Uhhuh. Okay. So, all right. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Henry. He takes your memory turns us to stars, scars and complexes. So that your human spirit, your human spirit that was made that way by God, by experiences, false teaching, false understanding, twisted up, but God doesn't want you to stay that way. All right, let's move forward now. Henry. Henry. Now, something's going to happen here. Try one more. There we go. When the Holy Spirit comes into the body realm or we'll say the anointing comes on your flesh, it affects the senses of the flesh. You might see something. The Bible says they saw licks of fire on each one. Is that the upper room? Bible says they heard the sound like a rushing mighty wind. You might feel the presence of God. It's just your body realm. You can be baptized in your body and go to hell. But let's uh now it comes a little bit deeper. The spirit moves into your spirit realm. Something is supposed to happen here when the spirit comes into the spirit. It gives you a new spirit. The Holy Spirit comes into your spirit and it cleanses you. God says, "I'll give you a new spirit, not a different spirit, &gt;&gt; but I'll renew your spirit." Amen. Just like he says, "I I I saw a new heaven and a new earth. It wasn't a different heaven. It was an earth that had been cleansed." So when the Holy Spirit comes into the human spirit, it gives you an experience, not a fleshly feeling. Now, many times it's an emotion. And brother Ram says we're human beings. We have emotions. But that's not the new birth. But brother Brown said the birds sing nicer. The birds sing nicer. The sun shines brighter. &gt;&gt; Why? Your spirit has been cleansed. &gt;&gt; And he says you have to be careful. He says you'll think you're born again, &gt;&gt; but you're not. That's just a new spirit. &gt;&gt; You can go that far and go to hell every day. Go to hell. That's why even that's why even people like the Pentecostals, they like to come together and have an emotional experience. They renew their spirit. to change the soul. But now be careful. It's also the reason you need to come to church. You need to gather together. As you rub shoulders with evil out there in the world, the devil will put things in your mind from the music, from the internet, from different things. We can come to church like Acts chapter 5. The Bible says they were all gathered together. They're not all filled with the Holy Ghost, including the ones that already were filled with the Holy Ghost. Why? Because we even being born again, we need refillings. There's a supernatural aspect. But don't stop here. Next one. Next one. When the spirit comes into the soul, now something happens. Hallelujah. Now unbelief is all burned. Now the seed gene of God has been quickened. There's no more unbelief. It's not just a new spirit. It's not just a new heart. God's spirit in you quickening [screaming] that CG. See to understand this you have to understand what John the Baptist was saying. God is commissioned. The angel of the Lord said said, "Upon whom you see the spirit descending and remaining on now the spirit descended on him manyis prophesied. The spirit descended on him." But he didn't just say descending. He said and remaining. Hallelujah. He was the manifested word for that hour. [screaming] You are the manifested word of this hour. God's [screaming] spirit by the anointed word. There is no more unbelief left in there. You are changed. You [screaming] are baptized with the Holy Ghost with fire. You have [screaming] taken on the nature of God. You have manifested a son of God. [screaming] You can no more doubt because there's no more doubts in you. Can I make mistakes, Brother Tim? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's still this stinking thing on the outside. But when this part makes a mistake, faith says that's not in the word of God. [screaming] And quickly you repent, become subject to the word of God. That is the reality of the new birth. [screaming] Brother Brown says, "I was born of Charles and Ella Brenham. In their nature I was a sinner of the world a liar. All the habits of the world laid right in me. But down in there too was another nature predestinated was in there by God. Same body, two natures in there. &gt;&gt; Well, I only catered to one. Well, I only catered to one. As it growed, I grew it as a baby. First thing you know, I became a liar. become everything else that's a sinner because I was raised up that way. But down in there was a little speck of life all was it. &gt;&gt; There was another William Brham. &gt;&gt; A little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God. The word of God was placed in there. Each one of you can think of similar things. &gt;&gt; It was working. Then I was born again. The little life was laying there and the life of water was poured upon it. Then it began to grow. Now that old life was forgiven, &gt;&gt; put in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; To never be remembered against me no more. Now we stand justified as though we never sinned in the presence of God. And so were you sons and daughters of God. Before there was a moon, stars or molecule, you were sons and daughters of God. You're only the physical manifestations of the attributes that was in God at the beginning. See, I'm trying to get you to see who you are. Son of God, daughter of God. I'm not trying to get you to see how you feel. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you into an emotional experience. But if the Holy Spirit can get you into a revelation that you're a child of the king, Amen. &gt;&gt; The gene of your life, spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there ever was a molecule. Amen. You're nothing but these of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Now you're expressed. His word has come in you to light up this age. &gt;&gt; Let me come and &gt;&gt; you got it. &gt;&gt; Let me get it. &gt;&gt; Do you get Give me the Henry, that little germ of life, that gene of God that we just talked talked about that attribute that come down from God and has been manifested here to honor and glorify God. We're closing now. Keep going. Keep going. All right. Keep going. We're going to have to skip this. Sorry. Keep going. It must be accepted in the mind. Then it's believed in the heart. Then the word of God becomes a reality. Then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit. Next. Next. Next. We're done. All right. Who are you? You were a hidden attribute of the life of God when you came into this world. &gt;&gt; But the word has come to show you who you are. That's why brother Brandham could say &gt;&gt; one day I realized &gt;&gt; I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom. &gt;&gt; The old William Brham is dead. &gt;&gt; I always was. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; always will be &gt;&gt; a son of God. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's why God &gt;&gt; sent his word &gt;&gt; to quicken you. &gt;&gt; And you are living in the greatest age there's ever been called in the Bible the manifestation or revelation of the sons of God. That time is now. &gt;&gt; Your revelation is here. It's all laying in the message. You got troubles. Get in the message. You got battles. The victory is in the message. It's not psychology. It's not emotionalism. It's not feelings. It's not psychology. &gt;&gt; Psychology is a study of the mind. Psychology. &gt;&gt; Medical science is a study of the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Religion is the study of the soul. But the message is the revelation of what's in the soul. Let's stand together. [applause] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we held the people a long time this morning, it takes the Holy Spirit to quicken this to the individual. If there be somebody in need this morning, somebody who the devil's tried to hold down, Lord, may you loose them. May you show them, that they're already free. Show them, Lord, that they're always been in your mind and there's nothing the devil can do to stop your plan in their life. We commit it to you now. Bless your word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [applause] Bless you guys. Amen. [music] [music] [applause] [applause and music] It has been a real good Sunday school teaching this morning. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I just felt we needed to go further and further but he has told us even after we are coming to the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So have you come to know who you are? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Have you seen yourself that you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world? That's why the message has come to you. Praise the name of our Lord. So we know we have the word of God, we have the life of God, we have the life of God, and we are now ready for the rapture. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us sing that song. I'm in that number as we go to preach over us. Amen. [music] I'm in that number. I'm in that number. I'm with that number. Rob.
