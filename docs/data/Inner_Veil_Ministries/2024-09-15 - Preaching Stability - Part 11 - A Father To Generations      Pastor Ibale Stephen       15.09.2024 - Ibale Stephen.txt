may they shine before their own peers Lord testify of the light that Lord the light may be their protection I know they are going among the men who don't know Christ their teachers don't know Christ sometimes their comments are negative but father I pray that you may help them to hold on the truth that they've already received I pray that you may protect them from the rampant Spirits in schools schools are now filled with drugs and even Sodom condition but father I pray that you may make this a light in the darkness and may it be said heavenly father that when the enemy attacks like a flood

give them the grace to retain information have committed them into your hands as they go back to school in Jesus name amen amen God bless [Applause] you so let's stand up as we get into the scripture reading and we just pray that the Lord may be present in this service e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e [Music] [Music] for [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music] e e 15 verse 45 he says and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul he was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit hallelujah hallelujah meaning the first man was made a living Soul so he was a man of flesh but then the second Adam is the lifegiving spirit which is the Lord Jesus himself he to come and bring birth of the living life on the side of the Bride body are you together with me so but because the devil so e was a s [Music] amen the enemy went and he started teaching her amen did God say amen and when she started reasoning on the word the devil was locked in the corner and when he was locked in the corner then he had to come back again it's true you shouldn't eat but it's only because if you eat you'll become like a god you know right and wrong and then the woman was called and when she allowed the wrong to know the wrong the wrong in itself brought death amen it brought death and man who was ever born to fulfill the scripture to multiply was born in a failure mode he was born in sin and the en of God has the sin failure [Music] system amen so God now therefore sought to turn that which is evil into that which is perfect and he could only do it by the power of the creative spoken word thank you so [Music] if use the word in the reverse order she looked to the creation That was supposed to look to her are you together with me but she turned her eyes so she used the word in the revers she did not really have that kind of confidence to realize her position that I am above this creation and every nature must look up amen that's what God wants us to do you shouldn't look down for leadership you look up are you together with me Christ looks up Amen to the father and he says I do nothing unless I see my father do amen a wife does not look down to a child a wife looks up to the husband th the order of [Applause] God God Christ husband wife even in church you don't look down you look up I'm trying to the principle of the fatherhood this morning amen if if so herself in the same power and authority Adam she would have not Fallen to the serpent because she was above that she should have looked Adam and Adam looked back to God the that have been fall fall comes when we use the word in the reverse order Amen brother Bram says we are living millions of miles below our god-given prev you know one thing which we should know is that we are fell hairs in all rights with Christ just like Adam and Eve were in the same Covenant before the fall so we should look to Christ all manner of life so because in all these things for the devil to achieve what he wants he has always to use the word in the reverse order amen so sin is the reverse order of righteousness and we should never think in terms of what if I do it this way are you together with me God certain principles of how everything should work but if you come to the point where you start saying what if I do this it also work God doesn't work like for everything he has got a principle we should never I mean we should always insist on a perfect will because permissive will is never God's perfect will so reversing the order of the headship WR down death into the human nature Eve submitted to the role of Adam I mean submitted the role of Adam to the serpent are you together with me look up let's make Mone in our own image amen so man should be looking to God Amen and when we see looking to the Head even in church there comes a disorder when we fa look to the order I mean to the fatherhood Amen in the family everything goes wrong so he must always look upward in that fall God revealed that he had the capacity to restore Human Nature by taking into himself the pain of the wages of sin are you together with me he stepped into the situation when he took the body of Jesus Christ so that he could take unto himself the wages of sin that you and me free amen that's what God did he had to swallow the pain of sin and Resto was man after he took man sin man his own righteousness amen and he restor by imputing his own righteousness upon him he repairs the damage that was caused by sin God gradually restor man the nature of sunship that he had lost in the fall are you together with me he restor to him that nature when he fills him with the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost finds a sitting place in the soul when he sits in the soul then you are seal to the day of your Redemption but yet on a day you know walk with God you have to deal with other conditions that attack your human spirit amen that's why in the Old Testament you find that the sh Glory the evidence of the presence of God was in the holy of holies all the time that was the seal upon that Tabernacle but the priests had continue doing daily ministration and daily sacrifice for the sins that were committed by the people so if you have fully accepted Christ as your personal savior there is a seal on the inside of you what you are dealing with is the daily failure in your human spirit that causes your body to error but God himself is determined to restore you to the perfect order where he created you by and how did you create you he created you by the spoken word and he wants to restore you the spoken that's the work of the second amen rest over you upon your face add virtue upon your face add knowledge upon your first and temp what is God doing restoring you into the original order by the spoken word so what Eve fa I mean Adam failed to do Christ has come to do and finally man will to the state of a perfect man again and that's why God hands back the Christian man the same principle of headship like he had given Adam the mind of God he gives man the word of God again he gives him the Holy Ghost he gives him the mind of God again in the New Path why does he give you all this for because you must multiply are you together with me you must multiply you must give birth you must speak the world and when you get one brother coming to the truth of the world that's multiplication that's multiplication you are m Ling Yourself by Looking Back to the principle you cannot multiply by looking to the organization because that's below you you have to look up to the world that's where we can get the new amen so let's go to the families here a little bit for the future families are bested on the light given to the father because that's the principle the father must have a life to because when the children come they look up to the father so this is what I'm talking about today I'm talking about a different type of fatherhood father to a generation not only father to a child but when you are a man God wants to make you a father to a generation amen because your son when you bring forth your child your child will look to you Adam looked to should have looked to the father you bring forth a son a son will look to you understand what father means amen so even your daughter is building into a wife by looking to you so that's now being mother to a generation you have brought up a child but the life you are passing over to your child has got the capacity to bring forth another life amen th being a father to a generation but you are destroying your daughter because if you are not being the kind of a father being the kind of husband you are sending mixed signals to your daughter amen you are killing the future generation because if you are cruel in your house your daughter will know that this is what men are supposed to be she will even accept an abusive man because she doesn't have an interpretation of fatherhood she doesn't have an interpretation of a husband it is very very important fatherhood in is the stream of life for the future are you together with me his fatherhood we must make sure that God gives us Grace that we become a restored Adam that we come back into the state of the perfect amen that we may be able take up the challenges of Adam because when we are proper standing Adam then we are going to help our daughters to find the right kind of a man praise the Lord amen I tell you heah was a very successful man in a very successful marriage but God was more interested in the future Generations I didn't hear that amen heah was you know these days when girls are going to marry they sour a man out there amen the man sources them both ways and then she comes and canels the mother sometimes starts from the mother Mommy Mommy there is somebody what does he that one take from those ones you don't delay just accept and go with who go with [Music] theowing you how can you know him the following things you know later that's what they look for amen but you know here is now very successful man he's a king and then he finds a young lady he was in a successful marriage and that's good for all of you I know that many of you are in very successful marriages but then God is not looking at you when God made man he made him with a purpose that he multiplies hallelujah hallelujah and then brother Bram says in the message I believe it's marriage and divorce that when God said be fruitful and multiply he was not speaking to the Natural man because the natural man was not made yet the natural man was made in Genesis 2 so he was speaking to a spiritual man and then brother Bram says it is a spiritual multiplication hallelujah hallelujah so when you stand with the word as a husband and you are training your children and the children are coming the word of God that's the spiritual multiplication you are praying a father to a generation because the children are going to pass what they've got are you together with me that's the multiplication which is spoken about in Genesis chapter 1 amen so friends Brothers you are supposed to be doing a spiritual multiplication put down your children tell them about your past what you used to be and what God has made you now let them appreciate what the New Birth has made out of you is spiritual multiplication this is being a father to a generation and then another generation praise the Lord amen look at this ezekiah a very successful man and then in Isaiah 38 and verse one in those days was ezekiah to death and isah the prophet the son of came unto him and said unto him thus says the Lord set house in order for thou shal die and not live now Hezekiah was not sick because he was a sinner he was sick because that's the door of exit into the dimension of immortal life amen you may live in high levels like heah but I want tell you there is always a door of exit amen and that door automatically opens at a certain spot in life so we must live alive knowing that we don't know when that door is going to open so we must prove to be fathers to a generation before we are dead before we've gone out of this country I mean this m God sent the prophet go and tell Hezekiah to put his family in order because he must die appointed men to die him not postp training his children let him not postp helping his family to understand God let him do it now imagine he's doing what he's going to do but he's a sick man and he's heading out in death sometimes that's when parents say bring the children I want to see them before I die we should do what we are supposed to do in time zah was a very successful man he ruled Judah 29 years and he was a righteous man he put up a strong resistance against the kingdom of Assyria that had overrun the 10 tribes amen which were called Israel but Judah two tribes twoes amen because of the split of Israel can remember amen so he had fought might man he cared for the kingdom protected the Kingdom from Assyria with the power of two tries heah done great exploits outside there as a king but not as a father inside his house he had done great exploits he was a great engineer he had done great exploits he's a doctor he has saved many people he's a teacher he has brought up many students to Greatness to that I don't have a quar but you are going to die with your family in order the children need to relate to you in your God given Ro amen not in that role which was given by natural upbringing to make a teacher out of you to spend all your time teaching your children so that they can get a grade amen it's wonderful but where is your God given roong a father to Generations praise the Lord see the children need to see what fatherhood means they want to see you at the family altar they need to see you practically guiding them they want to see the father not studying only his work books but they want to the father pick up a church Ed that why you are training your children that way that they should go they want to see a husband out of you they've never seen you hug their mother they've never seen you become a father to your own children you are on remote control and some of you you start telling the sisters tell your children am I wrong I want to hear Am I Wrong the men who say it they are scared and the sisters who said them [Laughter] tell children to sweep no be a father in family the children don't know how you handle family crisis with grace everything which comes up you are busting up they don't understand Grace they don't know how you can handle people who criticize already seen they don't see your I will go for him that's what the children hear they hear what you say about the ministers that's what the children hear they hear what you say about people in church that's what the children the children have not seen whether you can display the nature and character of Joseph how can you handle the people who hurt you amen imagine those people the way they treated Joseph amen and today I was receiving messages from a person that was raised here and they were having a crisis where they go to church amen and then one of them was crying on the phone it was so sudden sometimes we make decisions not knowing what they are going to cause to our we always think we are right and when we take decisions the repercussions come five years later 10 years later and you don't have children they are wasted in drugs a father Baba knows how to handle his temper a father knows how to kind of cool a crisis in the family but you find father is that the mother is that they are quoting scriptures to one another God doesn't work like when you are married as a man your entire life as a father is a contribution to the principles of fatherhood to your kids amen how you supply for your family you are training your child is not going to live in a home where he will be comfort whether he has done something good for his kids so he has not a father amen you are supposed to create such an image before your family that the kids begin to become proud of you and the father rich or poor he will always be somebody's hero hallelujah hallelujah amen he always be somebody's hero you talk about these little children they go to school and they are bullied I report you to my daddy I report you to my daddy but the one who is bullying is a general in the Army but this child here does not care about that he knows that my father is stronger than the general yes hallelujah hallelujah we have got a father who is stronger than the devil amen amen that kind of confidence I will tell my father you see a father rich or poor you are supposed to be somebody's hero the way you deal with him negativ you are tearing the hearts of the family that know small husband but in his house know but when just a little bit when it gets out of the compound touch down like this praise the Lord have respect to the father amen so to a strong father the family will enjoy Divine fellowship with God ver First Peter chapter 3 there will be divine visitations angels will come into that family you may not see them with your eyes but they will be comfort in times of a crisis there will be answers to prayer all the time when you live down to prayer 44 years I've lived with Sister Sarah not because that they are not Hard Times Hard Times have always been there and even people wish if they could do anything us I don't know whether you heard that amen but these days some of these ladies they've not been brought up any little thing can go for the husband and you see they keep say as if you are calling them praise the Lord amen let's go to Genesis where the the family where there was a father a family there was a father oh Genesis 18 verse and the Lord said he had come down to destroy Sodom and shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall Beed blessing him I know him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him amen all the influence of Abraham is not stopping on his children infuence of Abraham as a father goes to the children and the children's children and the children's children he says he will command his children and his household after him he set stand and they shall keep the way of the Lord Justice and judgment and the Lord may bring upon Abra which he has spoken of him hallelujah hallelujah when he keeps his family together they are praying together God cannot withhold the promises when we kneel down to prayer you just lift up your heart and there is a Sweetness in the family God comes down to answer the prayer you see Abraham was an imposing statute to his family when they wanted to see God they saw him in their father Abraham amen where is God but in Abraham and for peace to Prevail you need not touch that image the children are trying to grow into that image destroy their image that's why it's very important for us in the church to respect one another whether that brother is poor he has got children that Look to Him treat him with respect after all before God we will always Redeemed by the same amount of money in the Old Testament all the souls were equal after all when we break out of this moral immortality the government will be the same praise the Lord amen we want to be a church that will be United together respecting one another and being able to raise Generations we are not trying to raise the church that is only there for 10 years years we are trying to raise a generation will problems be there yes but those problems canot split a family through that AB certain weaknesses as Christian father would have but he believed in the principle of the father that corrects his mistakes amen praise the Lord naturally listen to this fatherhood is the ability to pass on life and as sons of God we must have the grace when God has given us his life that we may pass on that life to the gifts of children which God gives to us and we must be consistent until we see that life a father in the sight of God doesn't only Supply DNA amen amen they should also share the knowledge God has given to them to their children that's a father of generations and this life must be spiritually nured Amen to a spiritual path much as we know that salvations of the Lord as parents to continue instructing our children and claiming them claiming them amen because you have to put your token there and claim them I'm putting my token there I'm claiming my children father give them to a father cares for what he has brought us God is a father have you heard me God is a father if we pray our children into the faith then God doesn't become a grandfather there and then he becomes a father A continuing Legacy praise the Lord the moment your child is born again he becomes your brother God is a father are you together with me listen to this quote here Ephesian church God has no Grand children salvation is not P by am you give like you can challenge some of the young people here when were you born again I was born like this you are father gives birth to to to redeem I was born like this because we teach our children come God greet good morning that one is a Believer bless bless and he grows up like that grows up coming to church and does not even remember he to conf for the new I grew up they baptized me praise the Lord I love you my friends God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural amen you start out with a truly Born Again [Music] Believers and the Next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they take a denominational name and are now Baptists methodists that's exactly what they are they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God and not the will of man to be saved but these folks they are all coming together by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for AE do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore they are no longer Christians they are now Baptist Methodist P message believer finished for because the message believer could have been a Pentecostal but then he got an opportunity to get a church and when he read it and understood it here and goes to the water finished you must be born again God can only work in a man's life when he isther to that person God does not go and bring neighbors children and then begins to care for them he's not like you God wants to care for his own children he a father a woman of can of Canaan came out from the same coast and cried out to him saying have Mery on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil now this woman here was a gentile and she was calling C that son of David it really did not go good with CHR amen you see and then God you know the Lord told him we cannot get you know children's food and give it God God only works with his children that's why he says after this manner pray Our Father which are in heaven allowed be thy name your son is kneeling here your son ising there all of you you are saying our our what God deals with with children our father is the creator our father is a king our father is a chastising God our Father Is Love Our Father is rich in Mery our father is the shepherd Our Father Is A Healer amen he wants to relate with you a father he's a responsible father he deals with the children to make them a testimony he keeps his Covenant Hallelujah listen now God wants to receive you the basis of father is that good teaching this morning Our Father everybody confessing that I'm born again not because I was born in the flesh and then I was born in pastor's family no you must be born again for God to become your father and makes you a testimony that that on the inside there is a life that dwells them amen let's look at this fatherhood he gets one and then that one passes on the life to another and then that life is passed on to another that's what I'm talking about your DNA does not help your child the education you give him is wonderful but it's not enough he must be born again amen amen he spoke to Isaac in Genesis 26 and verse 24 and he say and the Lord appeared unto Isaac the same night and I am the god of Abraham father fear not I am with thee bless thee thy my Serv Abraham sake hallelujah hallelujah that Abraham pleased God so much that even his own blessing will bless Abraham's children now he's a father to Generations amen then Abraham was a testimony in the life of ISAC and this gave ISAC a standing order amen and made ISAC a testimony to Jacob are you together with me okay I want you to follow me very well in chapter 28 of Genesis verse 1 and behold the Lord stood above it God testified about ISAC I mean about Abraham toac okay now God is uh testifying to Jacob about Abraham andac the life was passing on okay Genesis 283 and behold the Lord stood above it that's the ladder the vision of the ladder and he said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac amen the land where thou liest to thee will I give it unto thy se you are resourcing from the blessing Hallelujah you see the M says your grandfather but actually the scripture says and the god of AB thy father soob came also into line and when we go to Exodus chapter 3 verse 6 we see the life has been passing on generation to generation he says moreover he say I am the god of thy father the god of abrah the god of ISAC and the god of Jacob Moses hid his face are you together with me everybody is overcoming God is identifying you as a father Hallelujah he doesn't say I'm the great grandfather no I'm the god of Abraham your father even the god of your father the god of Jacob your father God does not have [Applause] grandchildren we must be born again our father is a father to Generations he's not giving birth to a church which must just survive 20 years there must be something past keeps passing on God wants to parade us as testimonies to Moses Abraham ISAC Jacob he wants to parade us after he has pged us amen praise the Lord let's go to isai 58 and verse 12 we are going to use a few scriptures to really bring this principle to life Isaiah verse 12 amen you brother sister this scripture is yours person especially to you father he says and they that shall be of thee shall build the old west places Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called theer of the bridge the restorer of paths who dwell so with a strong fatherhood we are building old west places the wor that your father passed over to you should not pass on to your children build the old west places the churches must be back as places of Honor when our children are born again they will have enough word character to come through their child training adoption of sons because they've been raised up amen this generation has passed on the same life this is what we should do in our homes let us pray for our children let us pray together with them let us read on the seals with them let us study the Bible with them giving them just the is not enough amen the father does something to cultivate men amen who will uphold the foundations of many generations because this men here they are not Creepers the creeper this plant which CS around the tree amen he's not a creeper he must be a standing plant amen fathers let us plant vineard let us weed out the weeds let us prun the trees let us teach our children let us guide them let us instruct them let us love them so that they may know they are not supposed to be creepers hallelujah hallelujah that even if the Lord harvested you today they have got the ability to stand amen it's not good to have a creeper family amen they are standing because the father is standing and when the father is gone the children are gone not a father Generations amen they will have to learn very good things from us brother Bram says here then also we have a home life crisis it seems like the home life is running out shallow Waters it used to be in a that a father the head of the house would sit down in the morning and he would speak with his family and they would all take out the old Family Bible and read a little bit gather around the table and have prayer let me tell you one thing we do that amen and then my little grand kids I was seated in my chair and then she called all the other six that were there and says come let us B the table and she KN down come come now you pray now grandfather you pray you are sowing a seed this children we have they don't know when to pray even when they should are you together with me this after amen he says that all that is dead amen they don't study the Bible they bring children to listen to the pastor in church after that so they go back back home and come again you are not trying to be a father to Generations let's go to the scripture we used first John chapter 2 verse do you think this is good for you this morning amen first John 23 we've got a few minutes like and then we shall be gone I write unto you fathers I want to respect all of you but I kindly ask the fathers to stand because this is your scripture thank you thank you brother thank you brother you are the backb you are the back stand sister har I understand you know how she ended up fighting [Music] went to the man that was in charge of the people and he says this men here were given the order to go and redeem Israel but look they've not done anything I want to go and stands in the books of History up to now so God bless you Sister amen and she has a testimony she has been able to bring up children who have got Muslim names but they are Christians I think that is [Applause] celebrated I know what she has come through fathers this is our church it should not die tomorrow it should mtip listen I'm reading this for you I write unto you fathers because you have known him that's from the beginning I write unto you young men where young men also stand up young men good Fathers and young men I'm going to bring you the principle here I write to young men because you have over the wicked one I write you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that from the beginning I've written unto you young men because you are strong where are the strong young men let the weak say I am strong amen see I want you to understand that the people that John was writing to as weak as you think you are weak John was not looking at these daily mistakes you make he was looking at the reason why you come to this church there is something in you that brings you before God and that is strength that's what John is trying to build Mighty Army so that you become a father of generations amen so and the word of God Abid in you and you have overcome the wicked one God bless you you may be seated as you listen so the concept of John here is the emphasis of fatherhood which has great binding effects on the stability of the church fathers young men little children amen so fathers is the main stream ofal life and the church life it is a bond of stability a family can only be strong when it has got a strong fire and the church can be strong if it has strong fathers if you want a dying Church become a man without a backbone because the church is depending on you nurture the children that God has given to you the pastor will not take over the RO of raising up your children the pastor is just an encouraging Factor he comes to encourage you that fight on young man fight on young man you have overcome the wicked oh I stumbled yesterday yes but and that's how we should look at one another amen that's a father Amen in the Kingdom of Israel the emphasis was raised among men and young men hallelujah hallelujah the women were not counted amen when they were planning the military strategy they looked at the men give us the number of men in the tri of Judah that can handle men who can go on their knees and to pray for one another that's the strongest weapon that God has given his church amen so you see military planning and Leadership was weaved around men that's why John says fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning men who have a personal experience with God they are born again hallelujah hallelujah he says father because you have known him from the beginning by the time you get children known him in the beginning God looked at your maturity and then says it's not good for a man to dwell alone give him a help me says you have known the Lord by the time you bring forth your children so what am I saying tonight if this as not been your standing you must now stand as a man and be a father to Generations life begins from the fatherhood men who have studed and related to God and they know where Adam fa and they will not let that happen amen so he says I've written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God Abid are you here young men are you strong in the faith yes sir let your children come to church amen it is not just a tradition it's a requirement amen we used to stay far away about 30 some years ago and then hope used to sing in the used to like singing special song and then she would leave and pass through a sugar Plantation sometimes unaware and we find she has gone because she wants to be early enough to sing a today somebody asked for a song I mean a special song when the service has started young men be strong be strong a young man missing a service why I've have written to you because you have Str you have overcome the wicked young men say we have won him that is wicked you see this is John is very practical when young men are strong in the word then young sisters are safe in the church they keep coming to church they are very happy they see calab growing they see Silas is growing so they are there very excited there is a redeemer coming to the image of Christ are you together with me yes sir that's what we are looking for and listen God dealt differently with Abraham Abraham became a strong foundation for ISAC he could have dealt with Isaac differently but Isaac became a strong foundation for Jacob to stand on Jacob spre out 12 branches the 12 Pats all together they made the strong Nation I'll give you this Genesis 177 a powerful scripture and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee by thy SE after their Generations Everlasting Covenant to be a unto thee thy seed after the are you together with me this is how God blesses a father to Generations I want to see a father who becomes a strong foundation with the ability to manage his family with the ability to teach his family he can lead and guide his family blessing SP Beyond him to his children and because the children have beened a certain way they flowing oh Hallelujah they build the old west places praise the Lord I want to see fathers who are doing things from one heart whatever he does he doing it from the heart God would so much respect that amen and what they do attaches to them as a life are you together with me yes sir the people can pay their TI not to show a name on the envelope no sir but they know what they are doing and it's the heart doing it and abrah when he did that God planted that blessing to his DNA does that make sense do everything not only from your heart baby but rather from the central part of your life you are into what we do by your is what comes to church is what brings you in Fellowship what makes you loveen that what [Music] you together with me Abraham was that way until when he paid his time goore it into his DNA and the scripture says p in the lines of Abraham connected to d a father to Generations are you together with me he not only sharing out his natural DNA but his talken as well to the family okay every Church age I'm trying to to finish every Church age was a Foundation to the next age do you now see the principle a father to generation the Overcomers of this age became the next age and they continue going like that until at the end today we've got the beautiful bride Jesus ch let's go to Psalms 144 when you look at your children regard them as Generations so that something can be said about you just say the father of Abra I mean of David David the father of Solomon Solomon the father of you are a father to Generations let the genealogy of faith not your Psalms 145 verse three great is the Lord and greatly be prais and his greatness is unable one generation shall praise thy Works to another and shall declare thy Mighty works building a legacy amen you see with a legacy I will ask what are we leaving behind this generation shall praise thy Work to another generation amen what leg are we living behind great Fighters capable break families great Fighters that can break a church what's the Legacy come on fathers it's a challenge this morning God called you and when you work your work is done he will retire you and very soon do whatever you do from your heart come to church from the heart teach your children from the heart a father Generations do all these things such a Zeal that when you pass away your life is as alive as it always was I want to see fathers that are building for the generations in whatever they do amen teach your children respect you shouldn't be taught your child is insulting people and they even make fun and they even put it on what what's that upate status update and they hide what they mean and look at the cry they are mocking somebody and the parent doesn't care what would you mean by this a father to Generations generational fatherhood is building strong and memorable foundations that God can always bless let's go to First Kings God is a father God is a father can we say this God is and then together our father now to some of us who have children here we've said it together with our children Our Father even my grandchildren have been saying our father that's the relationship God so I want to take you a few scriptures here where you can become a generational father you could look behind you and your father was a drunker he was a drug addict it could be anything that you can point to he was a witch but now you can build the old west places and you become a father to Generations in First Kings 1511 and Assa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord as did David his father but David was not the father but now because he was a king he was successful and the only King in success that could be pointed back to was David so David as far as kings was concerned he was the father to Generations are you together with me yeah try to become a father of generations became a father to the generations amen let's go down to se Kings 2250 and slept with his fathers and was bued with his fathers in the city of David father and yet David was not the natural father but what he planted as a king it furthered Generations amen then when you got Second Kings [Music] 18 I mean verse one I'm winding up on this concept now it came to pass in the Third Year ofos son of king of Egypt that Hezekiah the son of aaz King of Judah began to re amen began to do what began to 25 years old was he when he began to rain and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem his mother's name also was AB the daughter of Zarah and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David [Music] father father to Generations fathers would you desire to be a father to Generations God Havey God usce when he comes to2 verse one second Kings he says Josiah was 80 years 8 years when he began to rain and heed 31 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Jed the daughter ofos and it is that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of David's father so David is a generational father in the field of Kings amen that's why in the chronology chology [Music] he's the only one that's referred to as The King The King Solomon is in the chronology but is not called the king listen Matthew 1 ver 6 and J David the king and the kingon and then they continue counting them want you want to be called a father the father who is the father of generations God want to see a man who can command and his family a father that plants principles bless for Generations look at Joshua chapter 24 verse1 I want you to look at the scriptural principles and step in them and say father make me a father you look back up and in this age we've got somebody to look to God has given us a look back into that message and produce the kind of father that would be a father to Generations amen verse one and gathered all the tribes of Israel to and called the Elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God and Joshua said all the people says the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood amen even Terror the father of Abraham and the father of and they served other gods and I took your father Abraham amen from the other side of the flag generation fathers do something that lines you up father of Abraham father of Isaac father of Jacob father of M father of father of father present yourself somewhere say Lord make me a generation of father is that amen preer God bless you praise the Lord yes sir so fathers he this in Psalms 145 as I finish verse 12 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and Domin amen and you throughout all generations the Lord uphold all that and raes up all uhuh together with me he rules through all these generations and is responsible he uphold your children when they fall he will raise them up just put the word in them God will be responsible God bless you God bless you father to Generations amen amen amen amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise a father to generations and he SW that you do whatever it takes if you put these principles in your children when they fall I'll raise them up God bless you God bless you amen do you love him let's stand up we love the Lord precious father today we give thanks to you you've spoken to us about fatherhood it is the strength of the church I pray Lord that you may take these words that have spoken to your children and give them life that they may always stand before the fathers and before the young men God be gracious in Jesus name amen amen listen fathers if you have to have a generation Left Behind take care of your sons take care of your son if there is anybody to leave behind on a day of service let it never be your son much as you should not leave any behind give your son because it's the continuity of life when the boys are right the girls will always be right we get our younger men to go into marriage what do they have no morals no nothing they cannot take pain they can't be patient in a few months there's trouble in the house the men take care of the sons we shall have a strong church God bless [Applause] you behold
