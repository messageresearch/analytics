Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for this afternoon. We give praise and honor to your name that you are still the same yesterday, today, and forever. You've already done so many great things for us. Every &gt;&gt; day we live because of you and we want to rejoice for all the things and how evil Satan is that he always points us to the things which we don't have. He always points us to our failures. points us to our weaknesses. It points us to all negative things about us. Father, we want to thank you that we can count our blessings, naming them one by one, you've done so great things and we can't tell everyone. We pray may increase our faith that even the things that we lack, Lord know that you're more than able to do them. that we may not be dismayed. We may not be discouraged, but we may be encouraged and keep on pressing, trusting in you, Lord, believing in you, Lord, and depending upon it. We want to thank you, Father. We commit the reading of the word into your hands and the hearing of it. Lord, you may come and speak to us according the burdens that we have and encourage every one of us. Bless us in such a special in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go to Luke chapter 5. We reading from verse 16 to verse 26 is &gt;&gt; some story Luke 5 verse 16. and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed. And it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was present to him. And behold, men brought in a bed, in a bed a man which was taken with pulsy, and They sought means to bring him in and lay him before him. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop and let him through the tiring with his coach into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, "Man, thy sins are forgiven. Neverchang. And the scriers and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? For who can forgive sins but God alone?" But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, "What reason ye in your hearts? What is easier to say, "Thy sins be forgiven thee," or to say, "Rise up and walk? But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon earth to forgive sins, he said to the sick of I say unto thee, arise, and take up thy coach, and go in thine house. And immediately arose up before them and took up the took and took up that where on he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God. And they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today. May God sing of his word. You may be seated. I want us to pick a text from verse 17 which says the power of God was present to heal them. So I want to talk about the power of God is present. Praise the name of our Lord. The power of God is present. And you know Satan many times he always wants to put things of God to be to look like they are far away from us. So when you think about God you always think is there in heaven but here is not here with me. So everything the devil wants us to post them to be far away from us. He he wants us to believe that there is no presence of God with us. He wants us to think there is no God in me or there's no God about me and so you put it far away you know like now somebody when he hears about the ministry of brother Brana then he said oh God I wish I was there. I wish I was there at the brana and then I go before brother and then he discerns me. Oh, this is what you want. I wish I had also that kind of feeling calm down I don't know what to do. But the Bible say don't say that praise the name of our lord you know don't say who will go to heaven to bring him down because you had he ascended into the heaven or who will go to hell to bring him from hell because you knew he was buried and he says the word is near you. The word is in your heart, even in your mouth. How close God is. Praise the name of our Lord. It says the word of faith. You know, it's just believing it. And then you see that God manifest himself that is present. Praise the name of our Lord. So then like for example you know when you are conscious about the presence of God you are not going to think something wrong. When you are conscious about the presence of God you're not going to do things which are wrong you know because you want to be in that kind of continuous fellowship. Praise the name of our Lord. And this is what happens in our lives. You know that when the Lord is inside of you, you'll always be mindful about the things of God. Thinking about the things of God, talking about the things of God, you know, because God is within you. Like when Nathan when he went and visited David and then David told Nathan how I sleep in a good house. &gt;&gt; But you see the ark of the Lord, it needs a permanent place. And then the prophet told the king, God is with you. Do what is in your heart. And we need to have the same testimony that you see the Lord is with me. Praise the name of our Lord. It should be that kind of thing that you know you can talk to God. He can talk to you and then you are certain you know you are sure that indeed the Lord lives with me. The Lord resides in me. And this is what the Bible tells us. He says, "I'll come unto you. I'll be in you." So the Lord is present within us. Praise the name of our Lord. But then the devil tells you is far away. He doesn't know even what's happening to you. That is not so. When you are born again, praise the name of our Lord. Christ himself lives within you. Praise the name of our Lord. You look at Saul when he was going to know to Damascus persecuting people and then the pillar of fire appeared to him along the way and then he called him in Hebrew. Saul where did he find Jesus to persecute? But Christ was living in the believers. Matthew chapter 25, he said, "When I was sick, you didn't visit me. When I was in prison, you didn't visit me. When I was hungry, you didn't give me food. You didn't give me food. When I was hungry, you didn't give me food." So, where was he? He was in the body form of believers. He was residing in believers. So God is right present in your life. Praise the name of our Lord. You don't need the devil to tell you is far away from you. It's just the devil deceiving you. Praise the name of Allah. So you need to believe. And now one thing about the scriptures, he said, I was in prison. Then you ask how can God be in prison? But he permits such a condition to come. I was hungry. How can God be hungry? But even Jesus was hungry. Even Jesus was put in prison. Even Jesus, he had wounds. In other words, he was sick. Praise the name of our Lord. You know, he took our burdens. He shared our sorrows. He took He took the pain of what we go through. He knows exactly what we go through. Praise the name of Lord. No wonder the Bible says, he is a high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmity. So whatever infirmity we have, God is concerned about your condition. God is concerned about your strength. And so you need to build faith. You need to have faith. It's the issue you want before God and say, "Lord, this is my petition. Lord, this is my desire." And now when you present it before the Lord, don't have doubt about it, but believe the Lord as I've presented this issue before you are going to have what I've asked him to have. Praise the name of the Lord. There is a testimony here. Praise the name of the Lord. There are people brother Brham had prayed for and then one had a stomach problem you know and different things and then brother Brandham pronounced them. Thus says the Lord you are healed. And then there was also another one who had a tumor you know just below her chin. And then also brother Brandham declared to them thus says the lord you are healed. And then it so happened that these people were hundreds of miles from the meeting. So they had traveled a long distance to go for those meetings and then they now they happened that they knew one another and then they drove together going and then they started testifying. For me it told me this. For me it told me this. But to them in their bodies there was like no change. So they went to their homes two three weeks no change but he told them you are healed says the lord and then the husband of one told the wife you know you are bringing a reproach to Christ because they kept on testifying I am healed I am healed I am healed then she told the husband that even if it takes 50 years, I will testify that I'm praise the name of. And then she told her husband, if he could tell me where I come from, she told me how I got this condition and he has also told me that I'm healed. Praise the name of Allah. The same thing with that congressman up [Music] You know, brother Brandham saw a vision and then he told him, "Hey, you got this suit. You you got this suit then this is how you change." He told him things before he came and then he told him, "God has healed you." Many years the man has been in a wheelchair. So the wife came and told him, "No, please. No, please. Don't come out. If he would tell me things before which are true, can he tell me things afterwards? Praise the name of our Lord. So you just need to see that you keep your faith in what you have asked God to do. Praise the name of our Lord. So then brother Brham says let us go that message El Shai I just want to read some section here. So this woman something just came and happened in her body and she just felt and then immediately she started feeling hungry and she started eating things that were troubling her because they were the only thing around. And then she went on doing her work and then she felt more hungry. Then she prepared and ate then she was going to the neighborhood. to go and testify. &gt;&gt; And now when she was reaching there, she heard a lot of screaming. So he says, "And when she got almost to the house, she heard somebody screaming down there at the top of their voice." And she ran to the door and jacked open. Here was this woman with the sheet in her hand, shaking the sheet, walking up and down the floor, asking what's the matter because the tumor was not there. She woke up when it was not there. And then she was wondering where is it? Checking on the sheet. How did it fall? The woman that had the lamp on her neck said, "You know what?" said, "This morning I got up and the lamp is gone. I've searched through the bed, shook the sheets everywhere and I can't find it anywhere." And then they come about 500 miles to testify of that. What was it? The angel of the Lord pass through the neighborhood that morning. See, sometimes God can't answer you just that moment. How many knows that Daniel prayed and it was 21 days before? Remember that. Sure. But when God says anything, God stays with his word. You stay with it too. But if you leave the word, you leave God. You leave your blessings and everything else. Stay and obey God's word. What God says, God does. Praise the name of our Lord. He says the angel was moving in the neighborhood. to fulfill the promise of God. Like in the morning we read that the shadow is standing between one's blessing and between one and the angel of the Lord. The angel has the blessing, right? But then there is doubt between you and the angel. You know the Bible says the angels of the Lord and camp around them that are righteous. You take it by faith that while I'm here, the angels of the Lord are here. Praise the name of our Lord. The Bible say the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. Have faith in yourself that my footsteps are being ordered of the Lord. You just have faith in the word and then you will see the presence of God magnified. Praise the name of our Lord. The presence of God coming over. You know like David when he told the prophet I need to build for the Lord then the prophet said you are right go ahead because God is in your heart. In other words it is God who has given you that burden do something. Praise the name of our Lord. And if you are a righteous person, then the footsteps of the Lord are ordered of the Lord. You shouldn't give up. Praise the name of the Lord. If the Lord puts a burden upon your heart, pray about it. Commit it to the Lord. Believe in the Lord for what you are praying. It will come to pass. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Praise the name of our Lord. Like Abraham waited 25 years or so waiting for the promise of God and God came and fulfilled it. The same thing with us also. Whatever I desire of the Lord, let me pray believing that the Lord will make it come. And so don't allow to be discouraged by any circumstance comes and you said these things I think they are not right don't do that praise the name of don't say I wish I could see first a vision brother Brandham said the visions could not hear [Music] the gift could not heal but it only increased your faith to know that sure the Lord is here to do that. So he would discern and then when he tells you that then it increases your faith. But now we have a sure word of God and faith comes by hearing God. So then you need to take the word of God and believe in the Lord and then see that the Lord performs what he has promised. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So don't allow unbelief to come between you. But believe the Lord that the Lord is present with me. His power is within me to work out upon my life to change me to transform me. Then you stop looking at your failures. You stop looking at your problems, but then you look at the promises of the Lord. Praise the name of Lord. That's how we need to live every other day. I'm looking at the promises of God. I'm counting my blessings. Praise the name of God, not my troubles. When the more you look at your troubles, the more you're going to get into complaining. When you go to complaining, darkness takes a hold of you. So you have no faith. You have you have doubt instead. You have unbelief. So it takes a hold of you. Now for me I don't know again this one here again this one here. But look at the positive things. Praise the name of the things that the Lord has done. and said, "The Lord did this for me. The Lord did this for me. The Lord did this for me. Praise the name of every day." We have many new things to testify about. Praise the name of how the Lord protected me through the night. You can testify about somebody that is also a testimony. Tell them, "Yeah, those who died at night, they have everything." And very strange enough, you get a rich man with everything, not even hospitalized, but he's dying. Then you get a man who has been bedridden for 10 years, doesn't have anything, but God is keeping it. So every day we live for the glory of God. Praise the name of our you know he watches over us. He takes charge over our lives. Then you can use the things that the Lord is doing. Say Lord I thank you. Lord I glorify your holy name. Praise the name of God. Like in the course of last week, our brother, you know, he was called to go to you know because the the pastor of that church had passed on last year. But he said that this church should believe should belong to the message. Whether two people remain or three, the church is for the message. But now some other people, you know, with inclinations to false teaching, they were saying, "No, no, no. We have to take over." So they fought but God helped to handle that situation. So now the wife of that pastor who pastor She was becoming also weak. She was hospitalized. So she called for brother and told him please my condition is not good but I want to hand over the church to you because there are some people who are here and they are trying to fight us. So then he went there and then now they were meant to make an agreement &gt;&gt; to change it as the as the the deceased pastor had wanted because the wife said I'm the only person remaining and this thing should be done when I'm still alive but the other group fought until now when brother K was trying to take you No photos. When they were in the meeting, about 12 people descended on him and they beat him. They had everything almost killing him. The other people just went to rescue him. They brought police to intervene and they arrested all these 12 people. And so what happened at the end of the day were arrested. Whatever was needed was done. And then the the the agreement was changed when the other people were in prison whether they were in police. But now where the miracle was, praise the name of when brother Ku went back home, you know, he was not feeling well. So when he went to the a certain place health center where he stays the medical person told him I advise you to go to Ha hospital where they have equipment to check you because your condition what you are saying you may be in a bad condition. So he went there that was on Tuesday that was last week on Tuesday and then the doctors told him you need to do scan of this test this blood test this test this. So when they went to do the scan, test the blood, everything, they found that I think it is the veins which take blood in his head. They are blocked. Then they started looking at him. Are you no more? He said, but I'm done. He said, no, you man. You don't know your condition. He said your condition is an emergency. You need to be in because you you can just run mad and you can never come back or you can die any time now. They were looking at the scans and they're looking at the person. The things were not matching. They brought other consultants they to check. They looked at him. What is your name? &gt;&gt; What do you do? &gt;&gt; Where did you come from? How did you come here? &gt;&gt; Then he told him, but me people to give me treatment, I go back home. Said you man, you don't know what you are. We can never release you. So they held him in hospital. Then they called another specialist from Campala. The following day came and also checked said you man are you normal? What work do you do? He said, "I'm a pastor." He said, "Your God is the one who is just keeping you." So they held him another day trying to monitor. When the specialist came said, "Now you need to add another medicine because your condition is critical." And each tablet I think was how much money? I don't know whether it was 30,000 I don't know but a lot of money just one tablet and then they said we want to monitor you and see that you are not you don't become a disaster at home so they hold him there until Saturday I think it was yesterday or day before yesterday but you see the protection of God otherwise with that condition he would be dead now. So there's always the presence of God that watches over his children. And sometimes we don't know the Satan is attacking us. Praise the name of our so we need to be courageous. I know that the Lord is with me. The Lord is watching over my life. The Lord will lead me. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; Now in the message, &gt;&gt; the power of the devil, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says we find here a daughter of Levi or a son of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. This child was born and when it was born they seen that it was the right kind of a child and I hope you get this. She looked at that baby and there was something taking place. She knew that the time was nigh that they should be delivered and the Holy Spirit to my opinion revealed to her this is him and she wasn't afraid of the king's commandments and he threats. There you are. When faith takes a hold, fear drops away. Look at that woman. The king has said, "Kill all the male children." But then she said, "This one is a proper child. I'm not going to kill my child." and her faith took her hold and said, "Okay, I'm not going to keep my child in." And then she said, "Let me make an ark, you know, let me make a basket, you know, and then put him on the river." Leadership of God. Praise the name of our Lord. And that's how God leads us all. Then he says, When faith takes a hold, fear drops away. Faith has got big muscles and hairy chest. And when it speaks, everything else keeps quiet. Cancer has to shatter and get out of the way. tumor TB &gt;&gt; and the rest of them &gt;&gt; moves out when faith raises. Then he said, "Let it be King Pharaoh, whoever it was, when that little housewife raised up and looked at that child, She was not afraid what the king said. That's the second you know then he says Satan the power of the devil he has power and reign of death. But the second power was given was faith. And faith puts Satan to shame. Praise the name of the Lord. So use faith in your condition and then you'll see Satan back up. Darkness will go away. Doubt will go away. Will go away. You just need to have faith. Praise the name of our Lord. And then you will see what you desire of the Lord come forth. Praise the name of God. Then in the message return and Jubilee, he says goes to show what faith can do. I think if a person is ever sure in their heart and as something that faith can anchor on, they should never cease. No matter how many times they are defeated, they should continue on. That is faith. Praise the name of the Lord. If you don't give up, You say, "Ah, this is what I'm on." Regardless of what happened, faith should take a firm ground. Praise the name of our Lord. Faith should take a firm ground and you know see that it is anchored and whatever you desire of the Lord pray believing but not that the Lord will do it. Praise the name of our Lord in the message the proof of his resurrection he says and here they are he was talking about Cleopus and his friend when they were moving to Emos discouraged now going back home. Well, we started out. We thought it would be all right, but we have to go back home now and they on the road back to Emma. And as they walked along discouraged, their conversation was right. They were talking about him. And that is when he appeared. Praise the name of our Lord. Let us have the courage of talking about God. At your home, you talk about God. You know what the Lord has done. You know the scripture I have read. Learn to be sharing as a family, maybe with your friends, with your neighbors. Praise the name of our Lord. Learn to talk about God that will be casting out unbelief. It will be casting out doubt. And brother Brandham says when you talk about God, that is when he appears. And that's the reason It doesn't appear to so many of us today why our conversations is talking about everything else but Christ [Music] has no room in your conversation. You see sometimes when you go to a restaurant &gt;&gt; you have got food even you don't know you don't want your friends know that you're a Christian so when you are going to eat or you just say it in your heart be bold enough tell them God has given us this food let us bless this food praise the name have to start from there to observe this one to pray or not. You are eating with the devil. &gt;&gt; You have stolen God's food. You know there are those they don't want to show that you know. Oh, just bends a little. Amen. Now, the Bible says, "Sanctify the food by the word of prayer." Yeah, you do that. Learn it to be part of you. Lord, we commit this food into your hands. May you bless and sanctify it for the use of our body in Jesus's name. Then the other will start looking around. Yeah, let them know you are there. Of course, you're not going to shout at the top of your voice, but they going to observe [Music] without prayer. You know, there was a child who was kidnapped. I don't know which place exactly. You know those people who do things are just rough people. So they took the child to the restaurant and then they ordered the food. What do you want to eat? &gt;&gt; This now for them they got the food started just eating. But this child was taught don't eat without praying. So the child was waiting for prayer. You eat and said I can't eat without prayer. was then this man was forcing the child the child was not eating then the people in the restaurant said there is something wrong here that's how that child was saved praise the name of God just coming down on the scene what do you call this child that's how the child was delivered so we need to see Learn to talk about God. When you are eating, you can die. You know what the Lord has done. You know, there are some of those who are nonbelievers and they fear poison. So when they believe when they walk with the believer like a pastor because they know your prayer is going to sanctify the poison but take opportunity to talk to them about God. Maybe you have meetings you can tell them let us open the meeting with prayer. People are afraid of praying. People are always afraid of praying. So let us pray. You commit it to the hand. Then you see somebody ah before we go let us let pastor pray for us. Now our journey is safe. You are having opportunity to talk to them about it and as they humble themselves you can tell them what will you do on the judgment day. Hey you bring that in. There's a judgment day. When both started speaking before the king about the resurrection from the dead, the power of resurrection, the judgment that is coming, the king started trembling. The knees started beating one another. Said, "You go back. You'll tell me another time." You know but these things help to witness Christ to those people. Praise the name of our Lord. So always take opportunity to talk about God. When somebody see to them what the Lord has done, tell them you know there was this person who had this issue. This is what happened to them. There was another person who had this issue. This is what happened to them. Like when you read most of these message books, brother Brennham comes and gives testimonies about what the Lord did here, what the Lord did here, what the Lord did here. And then it builds up somebody's to bring it to reality. They are in the presence of the Lord. That the Lord is present with them. There should be also the same thing with us. Talk about the goodness of the Lord. Think about the goodness of the Lord. Praise the name of our Lord. Don't think about negative things all the time. Negative things, feeding on negative things, but there are positive things you can talk about. There are positive things you can think about. And then they increase your faith. They declare the presence of God. Praise the name of God. And God who always want to be testified about the things that he has done. Praise the name of our Lord. Let that be part of you all. Maybe you in the market. Praise the name of our Lord. You know this shouting there. One is shouting there. The other one is talking about the against the coine and the other one is on this. Talk about the goodness of the Lord. Talk about what the Lord has done. Not all the time on loses again this council again this one here again the other neighbor there take time and talk about the goodness of God. Even in the midst of all those disappointment, praise the name of God, talk good what the Lord has done. And then it builds your faith. It makes you motivated. And when you are praying, you know, your heart is merry. Praise the name of our Lord. You are just saying, Lord, I thank you for what you have done for my life. how you protected me. Lord, I thank you like these women. They were testifying. Praise the name of our Lord. And then the angel came and delivered their messages. Praise the name of our Lord. We just need to always take time and testify about the goodness of the Lord. What the Lord has done in my life. The presence of God. Praise the name of our Lord is always talk about him. Praise the name of our Lord. As I finish, let us go to Mark chapter 16 and then verse 17. He says, "And these signs shall follow them that believe." We don't follow signs, but signs follow us. If you believe, he says, "In my name, they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongue, and they shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Praise the name of Lord. We have these promises with us that as a believer, you can pray for anybody in whatever condition they invested this. I pray you make it come to pass. He said, believers, Brothers or sisters, as long as you're a believer, you can lay your hands on the sick and they can recover. Praise the name of our Lord. You can pray for any situation. Praise the name of our Lord. You know there are mothers who have children and the children are stubborn. I would look at this stubborn child. That stubborn child. Why are you praying him to be stubborn? Bless him. Praise the name of our change. If he's stubborn, cast out that demon. Praise the name of our Lord. You are praying him to be that because word has authority. So you are enforcing it and the more you talk about it, the more you believe it. Hey, but turn it around. &gt;&gt; Pronounce a blessing. Praise the name of pronounce a blessing upon your child. Pronounce a blessing upon your family. Pronounce a blessing upon your place. Pronounce a blessing upon the place you live in. You know you are the signs followed them that believe. Praise the name of Lord. So you pronounce a blessing. I'm praying for where I'm staying. I'm praying this condition goes away. I'm praying this thing doesn't happen again. I am praying for the protection of God that the thieves can no longer come and distur. You know you can do this kind of thing. Praise the name of the Lord. So it says this sign shall follow them that believe. Whatever you have need of bring it to the Lord in prayer. Praise the name of the Lord. Just bring it to the Lord in prayer. And believe the Lord will do it. Praise the name of the Lord. The Lord is always available. Praise the name of the Lord to perform his word. But then we have to believe Lord I'm doing all these things according to your word. You promised us that whatever we ask you'll give it to us that our joy may be complete. That's what the scripture saying in the book of John. Praise the name of our Lord. &gt;&gt; He says whatever you desire Pray and will be answered that your joy may be complete or your joy may be full. Praise the name of the Lord. Let me get that in the book of John. Praise the name of our Lord. John chapter 15. Okay. John chapter 16 verse 24. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, &gt;&gt; let us start from verse 23. &gt;&gt; And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Verily I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name, he will give it to you. He that have you asked nothing in my name? Ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full. Praise the name of our Lord that your joy may be full. So he has promised us to ask him. You take it by faith. Lord, this is my desire. Lord, this is my petition. I want my joy to praise the name of our Lord. And you believe God for what you asking. And then you don't just be in a panic mood, you know, but be patient with the Lord. Trust in the Lord. Depend upon the Lord and see the Lord coming to fulfill the desire. Praise the name of our Lord. The Lord is always present with us. We shouldn't allow the devil to think God is far away from us. I believe is right inside of you. What is right with you and his desire is to help you at all times. A very present help in the time of trouble. Pray in the name of Lord. So don't allow any stress to dismay. Don't allow any condition to come that will make your mind become negative about the things. Learn to be positive. Lord, this is my strateg.

Praise the name of our Lord. So let us go to First Corinians. And then chapter 11, we are reading from verse 23 up to verse 28. We always do this once in a month in the tabernacle. We're also doing it either I think at the end of the month or something like that. Praise the name of our Lord. You know the Bible says as often as you would. When you read in the book of Acts chapter two, they were doing it whenever they were gathering and their gatherings were in houses. So they would always do it and we just thank God that is giving us grace that we able to do this say that is part of our commitment to the Lord. There are many places where they have never done it. But you know it it we thank God that is giving us the grace to do it. You know even the Bible says that a widow was not counted a widow faithful if she had not washed the disciples feet. So it is very important us as believers to participate in this. It shows our commitment to what we believe. Praise the name of. So the Bible says, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread, And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sapped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood. This do as you oft remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord this death till he come. Wherefore soever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you for this moment of time that Lord, you've given unto us an opportunity that we can come to the Lord's table to fulfill what you did on the Good Friday or what you did on the Thursday rather. And Lord we remember it's who started this then you commanded Moses Passover and then you came and fulfilled it yourself to fulfill what did and what Moses did. You did the same and you went and fulfilled being the Passover lamb and we want to thank you father. It is such a solemn moment of time that we come to observe what you commanded us. And Lord, we've read in the scriptures, how you broke the bread, the unleavened bread, and how also you gave out the wine, symbolizing your body and your spirit. And here we have elements that have been prepared, the unleavened bread, and likewise the wine. We pray that you may sanctify them heavenly that they may be able to meet the purpose for the glory of your holy name. We also pray heavenly father that as we partake of them we may be blessed of the Lord. Father we pray if any of us is unworthy may you Lord forgive us. May you make us worthy Lord. We can't make ourselves one, but it's only the blood of Jesus Christ that can make us one. And so we pray may wash us fast from all unrighteousness, all powers of darkness from everything that's unlike. Father, Lord, we may be worthy to partake of you. are not only being worthy now, but help us to live a life that is worthy of the gospel. That every day we live, we may live in your worthiness, washed in the blood of Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, walking in tress, Lord, walking in the light of we pray bless us all. Grant all our hearts desire in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I think we can now break. &gt;&gt; One day when heaven was filled with these praisees. One day when sin was as black as could be, Jesus came forth to be born of a dwelt amongst men. My example is he all livinging he love me
