[3:27] amen amen well we are still standing
[3:31] I request we turn to our Bibles
[3:35] we got the book of Psalm chapter 17.
[3:41] we're reading from verse 13 to verse 15.
[3:45] a Canadian community
[3:48] Psalms chapter 17
[3:51] from verse 13 to verse 15.
[3:56] the scripture says
[4:00] arise O Lord disappoint him cast him
[4:04] down deliver my soul from the wicked
[4:07] which
[4:09] is thy sword
[4:23] from men which are thy hand O Lord from
[4:28] Men of the world which have their
[4:30] portion in this life and whose bury
[4:34] though fillest with thy High treasure
[4:36] they are full of children and live the
[4:40] rest of their substance to their babies
[4:53] or
[5:02] um
[5:19] as for me
[5:21] I will Behold thy face in righteousness
[5:25] I shall be satisfied when I awake with
[5:30] thy likeness
[5:54] beholding the face of God
[6:00] beholding the face of God
[6:03] so now here David gives a testimony
[6:08] and says ants for me yeah
[6:12] I will behold your face
[6:17] in righteousness
[6:19] and then I shall be satisfied
[6:23] and when I awake
[6:28] with thy likeness
[6:31] praise the name of our Lord we also want
[6:35] to behold the face of God this morning
[6:41] we need to see the face of God
[6:45] praise the name of our Lord we need to
[6:48] meet God
[6:49] face to face of my son praise the name
[6:52] of our Lord we need to interact with God
[6:57] we need to have a personal relationship
[7:00] with God
[7:02] so that it's not about the God you hear
[7:07] but the god that you know personally
[7:12] praise the name of Allah the God told us
[7:15] that you can talk to somebody about
[7:19] the God that you have a personal witness
[7:23] that I have met him
[7:28] I have heard him speak to him
[7:31] I have seen him this is what he is like
[7:35] you know initially this is who he is
[7:40] you know when we go to John chapter one
[7:45] praise the name of Allah
[7:48] let us go to John chapter 1.
[7:51] and then we read from verse
[7:56] John chapter 1.
[8:00] and then we read in verse 44.
[8:04] let us start from verse
[8:06] 43 that will come up
[8:10] the following day
[8:15] Jesus would go forth into Galilee and
[8:18] findeth Philip and says unto him follow
[8:21] me
[8:24] yes
[8:30] now Philip was of betheda the seat of
[8:34] Andrew and Peter Phillip
[8:40] Phillip findeth Nathaniel and says unto
[8:43] him we have found him of whom Moses in
[8:48] the law and the prophets did right Jesus
[8:51] of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[9:01] yes
[9:04] praise the name of Allah so here we see
[9:07] that Philip when he finds you know
[9:11] nothing
[9:13] he tells nothing
[10:12] of God in righteousness
[10:34] it changes your thinking it changes your
[10:38] imagination it changes your desires
[10:42] praise the name of our Lord when you
[10:44] behold the face of God
[10:47] it will change you completely
[10:50] from who you are to become who God is
[10:55] the name of our Lord when you interact
[10:58] with God when you come into His presence
[11:01] when you behold the face of God you
[11:05] don't remain the same
[11:07] praise the name of Allah
[11:09] Isaiah praise the name of Allah in
[11:13] Isaiah chapter six
[11:23] the Bible says
[11:29] in the end that King uziah died I saw
[11:32] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[11:36] and lifted up and this trained filled
[11:39] the temple
[11:49] above it stood the seraphims each one
[11:52] had six wings with trying he covered his
[11:55] face with trying to cover this feet and
[11:58] with trying he did fly verse
[12:11] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[12:15] holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[12:19] earth is full of his glory
[12:21] um
[12:31] and the posts of the door moved at the
[12:34] voice of him that cried and the house
[12:36] was filled with smoke
[12:45] [Music]
[12:48] then said I what is me for I have undone
[12:53] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[12:57] dwell in the midst of the people of
[12:59] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[13:03] king the Lord of hosts
[13:20] praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:23] so Isaiah had the vision and when Isaiah
[13:28] had the vision he saw the ground
[13:53] and
[13:58] when he saw the presence of God
[14:03] and then his son
[14:04] seraphim we are crying one to another
[14:09] I'm saying God is Holy Spirit
[14:14] and the whole earth is full of his grace
[14:18] and then he saw the post move from one
[14:21] to another
[14:39] [Music]
[14:46] does it bring conviction to yourself
[14:50] does it bring you into a state of saying
[14:56] here Isaiah
[15:01] a man was looking at us
[15:05] praise the name of the Lord and his eyes
[15:08] were not going Beyond
[15:10] praise the name of Allah but when he saw
[15:13] the presence of God
[15:15] all the friends of God he realized his
[15:19] conditions
[15:23] [Music]
[15:40] do you find yourself insufficient
[15:44] do you find yourself that you're not
[15:47] bothered about anything
[15:49] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[15:52] the Book of James
[15:54] chapter one
[15:57] foreign
[16:26] [Music]
[16:28] of the word and not hear us only
[16:32] deceiving your own selves
[16:35] [Music]
[16:41] for If any man be a hearer of the word
[16:44] and not a doer he is like unto a man
[16:49] beholding his natural face in a glass
[16:55] um
[17:03] for he beholdeth himself
[17:07] and goes his way and straight away
[17:10] forgeteth what manner of man he was
[17:21] so ever looketh into the perfect law of
[17:24] Liberty and continues therein he being
[17:29] not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
[17:33] work this man shall be blessed in his
[17:36] dead
[18:21] and then it shows you that you need to
[18:23] correct this you need to make this place
[18:27] better maybe the hair is not welcome
[18:31] maybe there is some kind of dirt here
[18:35] so now if you look at the mirror then
[18:39] you realize how
[18:52] come
[19:36] where is my condition
[19:38] so now the more you look into the word
[19:41] of God
[19:42] then the word of God should be able to
[19:46] cause attraction in your house
[19:48] to be like Jesus
[19:51] praise the name of Allah you look into
[19:54] the word of God
[19:56] you are beholding the face of God
[20:00] praise the name of Allah you are seeing
[20:03] God
[20:04] as he is
[20:06] praise the name of our Lord so it should
[20:09] cause a desire in you
[20:12] Lord change me Lord transformation
[20:16] when Isaiah praise the name of Allah in
[20:21] the presence of God he was able to cease
[20:25] as
[20:27] [Music]
[20:31] somebody who needs to be here
[20:34] how about us when we see the word of God
[20:38] before us when we hear the word of God
[20:42] are we contented by what we yeah
[20:46] oh we are not concerned of what the word
[20:50] is telling us
[20:51] when Isaiah into the presence of God
[20:57] he cried what is me
[21:00] I'm only worthy Lord I need your
[21:04] deliverance
[21:07] and that's what God also requires of us
[21:10] when I see in the word of God
[21:14] my limitations
[21:16] where are my failures
[21:21] what is my stand before God
[21:24] praise the name of Allah we need to call
[21:28] on the name of the Lord
[21:32] now in the message first
[21:35] I want to read there
[21:37] the prophet says and Isaiah
[21:42] that great thought that he had they
[21:45] don't tell you anything he perhaps was
[21:48] schooled
[21:51] he probably had a good education
[21:55] he had a marvelous conception of what
[21:59] God ought to be yeah
[22:03] he had had the priests
[22:06] he had been in the temple
[22:09] he had been raised to be a believer
[22:13] but you see he had never come face to
[22:18] face with it before yeah
[22:23] maybe some of us are in that same
[22:25] condition
[22:27] I've had the priest told me about God
[22:30] I've had my parents talk to me about God
[22:33] I've had my teachers tell me about it
[22:36] you know you are just hearing somebody
[22:39] else's testing
[22:41] you are just reading somebody else's
[22:43] story
[22:44] but then where do you put yourself in it
[22:49] praise the name of Allah Isaiah had the
[22:52] same thing
[22:53] maybe the mother had told him
[22:56] maybe the teachers
[23:02] like the region
[23:07] he had been taught well from his
[23:10] childhood
[23:16] what shall I do to have eternal life
[23:21] and then the Lord took him on the law of
[23:24] Moses
[23:51] [Music]
[24:03] [Music]
[24:26] come on
[24:52] and
[24:54] follow me
[25:12] and
[25:14] [Music]
[25:17] come and follow me
[25:20] and also we have the same opportunity
[25:26] when we come in contact with the world
[25:30] when we come in contact with the
[25:33] presence of God
[25:34] how do we respond
[25:37] to the word of God
[25:39] praise the name of Allah hear Isaiah
[25:42] before the presence of God he had been
[25:46] taught well he had been raised
[25:49] and then here he comes in the presence
[25:52] of God
[25:54] praise the name of Allah and then if the
[25:57] prophet says
[25:59] he had a desire to do right yeah
[26:02] he wanted to be right but he just had
[26:07] the educational side
[26:09] he had the theological side of it
[26:13] but when he got there in the temples
[26:25] These Wings back and forth
[26:28] and realize that these angels means that
[26:33] in the face of God
[26:36] and them Angels didn't know even sin
[26:39] foreign
[26:46] they covered their holy faces
[26:49] in to stand in the presence of God
[26:53] then that I have learned
[26:57] then that the prophet cried out
[27:00] what is me for I am a man of unclean
[27:04] life
[27:05] all of my theology
[27:11] all of my mother's conceptions
[27:14] [Music]
[27:17] I am friends to face with it now
[27:23] I am a man of unclean lips
[27:26] and I dwell with people that's unclean
[27:29] lips
[27:37] I will never reach the place
[27:41] to where he come into the presence of
[27:44] God
[27:45] understand god with his own eyes
[27:53] when he was sitting up on her
[27:56] in the heavens
[27:58] and there he was
[28:01] face to face with reality
[28:05] I am a man of unclean lips
[28:08] and I dwell among unclean people
[28:12] then it was the cherubim
[28:22] the unclean lips
[28:26] and he turned him from a coward
[28:29] from uneducated man
[28:37] [Music]
[29:00] [Music]
[29:18] [Music]
[29:29] and shout as long as you want to
[29:32] you may run up and down
[29:35] the floor and you might speak in tongues
[29:38] as much as you want and Them Things Are
[29:42] Holy and good
[29:43] I don't say nothing against it but until
[29:47] you meet that person
[29:50] that satisfying position
[29:53] that's something that takes every fiber
[29:56] in your body
[29:59] not by emotions but by a
[30:04] satisfactions
[30:06] and that's what we also need today
[30:09] praise the name of our Lord that's why
[30:12] it said Lord I want to meet you in face
[30:14] to face
[30:15] Lord I want to see you in person
[30:22] until a person has a back side of the
[30:26] desert experience
[30:29] like Moses you can't be changed
[30:33] praise the name of our Lord we also need
[30:36] that personal experience
[30:39] that I have met him
[30:42] like Philip the Philippines
[30:46] I read about it but now I have met him
[30:50] whom the Lord talks about
[30:52] we also need to meet him
[30:59] name
[31:50] I need to be
