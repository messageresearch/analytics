========================================

10 and then we are reading from verse rather MTH 13 verse 10 so the Bible says and the disciples came and said unto him why speak thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for soever has to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but soever has not from him shall be taken or even that he has we may be seated so today I want to preach on the subject he that praise the name of the Lord he that so the Bible says that without Parables Jesus never spoke to the people so he was always speaking to them in Parables and then the disciples came and asking the Lord Master why are speaking to them in parables and then he answer therefore speak I to them in Parables because seeing seeing they see not and hearing hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which said by hearing you shall hear and you shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall [Music] not for these people's hearts is waxed gross and their ears are D of he Ing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them praise the name of our Lord so now the Lord Jesus gave them the reason these people you know I speak to them in Parables that when they hear they have heard the word but they don't have the understanding of the word they have seen but they cannot perceive so now we see here that it is very important for us that whenever we come to the services of the Lord whenever we come to church we need to pray that God gives us understanding Lord give me understanding in this service that I may know the move of the Holy Spirit I may know the purpose of God speaking to us this [Music] message why has God chosen to speak to us this way praise the name of the Lord that we may not be in a sttion that you know our eyes can see but we don't understand our ears here but we can't understand and how to do everything so if we can't understand then it means that the sound that we are receiving is uncertain sound in other words you can never prepare yourself you know you don't know what the noise comes is meaning like in the Old Testament when they would blow a trumpet it had different kind of significances there is a way they would blow a trumpet in one way it would tell them that you come for the feast and then in another way it would tell them there is a war going on people had to understand you know the voice of the trumpet and what it signifies praise the name of our Lord what does the trumpet signify so that even as when we come to the services of the lord we need to seek the Lord and say Lord speak to me speak to me way I can understand you that I can make preparation based on what you desire me to do praise the name of the Lord so now when we go back to MTH 13 and then verse 11 he says he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know praise the name of the Lord so the Bible says it is given to us to know and then when you continue reading that scripture the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but unto them it is not given and then we see that we are living in an age where all the Myster my of the book have to be revealed and the mysteries of the book have all been revealed in Revelations 10 now what the devil does is to discredit the message you know and then say it is so that people don't pay attention to what is spoken you know that's what the devil does he makes sure that he he puts it down he makes sure that it means it he makes sure that it is of no relevance to you you may not give your ear it's the same spirit that was there even in the times of Jeremiah let us go to Jeremiah 18: amen amen Jeremiah 18 and then Verse 18 the Bible says then said they come come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor a counsel from the wise nor the word from the Prophet come and let us Smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words that's always what the devil does that you may not give he to what is spoken you know like discrediting the message [Music] discrediting the minister so that you don't have confidence you know to what is being spoken that's how the devil does he says let us go and smite his mouth and then us talk bad about him let us make sure that we put something bad about that person nobody would want to hear him nobody wants to go to those meetings nobody wants to go to that church that's what theil does and so now he keeps people away from hearing the truth the name of our Lord like now we we used to have this message books with an eego and so now what those people are saying when you see a book with it don't read it at all what are they doing they smiting with the tongue so that somebody who would be helped they have rejected what can help them praise the name of our Lord so let us go back to MTH 13 verse 11 he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but them it is not given verse 12 for soever ha to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but soever has not from him shall be taken away even that he [Music] praise the name of our Lord so now you see it says Whoever has now we want to see what is that you have and then he said when you have you shall be given and when you are given you shall love more about AB praise the name of Lord whoever now you can't have if you are not given praise the name of the Lord so then there had to be a giving in order for you to receive praise the name of the Lord the Bible says it is given to you to know the Mysteries now when it is given to us to know the Mysteries then we have access you know we have the Liberty we have a link to know more of God we have the access to receive more of God in us praise the name of the Lord just like the river once the river flows it doesn't stop flowing so it keeps on flowing keeps on flowing and that should also be our relationship should always be continuous before God the name of our Lord so the Bible says he that has so what do we have praise the name of our Lord now in the message brother let us go to MTH 11 and then verse 25 verse say at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee of father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast healed these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed themto the babies even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whom soever the son will reveal him so he says nobody knows the father except the son and nobody knows the son except the father and he to whom the son will reveal so to to whom does he reveal himself praise the name of our Lord now in the message the Ephesian Church AG he says he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches then he says it may be that Millions will hear this words or read them but how will to them that we don't know but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of the truth will find the spirit of God en lightening him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make the word real to you now that is a work of the spirit I can teach you the truth but if you don't have an open ear to hear it and your heart receive it you won't get Revelation praise the name of our Lord so we must have a willing heart desire to learn praise the name of the Lord desire to know more of God and we can see that in the scriptures when we go to the book of Acts and then we read in Chapter 13 praise the name of our Lord 1 and then verse 44 and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God but when the saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and baming then Paul and Barabas waed bold and say it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life La we turn to the Gentiles now the Jews rejected the word of God and then they Gentiles received the word of God and now as many as Gentiles received the word of God then they were delivered by the word of God as many as received the word of God they received eternal life but then those ones who rejected the word of God they counted themselves unworthy it's just like the invitation come to the wedding supper the Bible says each of them had excuses and then the scripture says they counted themselves unworthy now it's the people who count themselves as unworthy and then they reject the truth they reject the word of God but now when the Gentiles heard the word of God the Bible says they were glad and glorify the word of the Lord they glorified the word of the Lord and as many as we ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region praise the name of so when we have been given opportunity to hear desire to hear more of God desire to receive more of God praise the name of our Lord the more you hear is the more you receive God the more delivers you from your weaknesses is the more the Lord changes your mind is the more God works in your life praise the name of our Lord just the more you receive from the more youire from God praise the name of the Lord so now the Bible is telling us that as many as we are ordained to eternal life they believed so now if we are ordained to eternal life then it is us who have because the Bible says he that has what do you have you have been ordained to eternal life before the foundation of the world your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was there God already predestinated so now when you come here on Earth you already have praise the name of our Lord you already been ordained to eternal life you have already your name has already been written in heaven so now in the process of time you just come to your realization that my name is written in heaven and the name is not written in heaven the time the day you believe the name is not written in heaven the day you were born the name was written in heaven before the foundation of the world so then you have and so the Bible is addressing the people he that who are those who were known by God before the foundation of the world praise the name of our Lord let us go back to Matthew okay we can I think pick up from Luke chapter 10 verse 20 CH 10: 20 not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven praise the name of the Lord it says Rejoice because your name is written in heaven so you don't Rejoice because you can cast out demons you don't Rejoice because you can prophesy you don't Rejoice because you can do Miracles but you rejoice because your name is written in heaven and because your name is written in heaven then God has given you the ability to hear from him praise the name of Lord God has given you the ability to be able to hear from him because your name is written in heaven you look at the scenario of Paul praise the name of our Lord Paul was moving from Jerusalem and then he was going to Damascus and then he was having people with him coming from the temple in Jerusalem praise the name of the Lord now in Acts 26:3 he says at midday oh King I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the Sun shining round about me and them which Jour with me and when we were have all Fallen to the earth I had a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew Tong soul soul why me it is hard for to kick against the PRI now you see Paul is moving with a group of people soldiers of the temple to go and arrest people who are worshiping Jesus Christ and then a light appears and then they all fall to the ground but it is only Paul who had the voice and whose name was mentioned praise the name of our Lord PA had his name called Christ revealed himself to but then to the other people were moving with Paul they never understood what was taking place the only thing they would go back to Jerusalem and then maybe give a report the other man we went we went we were moving with there that came from heaven we met a light from heaven and we all fell to the ground and we just had a sound but we didn't know what it is we just had kind of noise and we didn't know what exactly it is so for them they went back to do their work but it's only sa who got the true revelation of Jesus Christ and now when his eyes were blind because of the glory of the light you know he was blind for three days and night he never or Dr anything so he was in praying and fasting because he said who are you Lord I'm Jesus so he took Time Lord forgive me confessing his sins Lord I didn't know you are the one when was waiting on the Lord then God showed him a vision anas coming and laying his on him and him receiving the sight now Saul he never went back to the high [Music] priests he never went back to his religion he never went back to his denomination he had found the true path of Christ so Paul heard praise the name of the Lord that Paul praise the name of our Lord and because his name was written in heaven he had the ability to hear the voice of God calling him out of the confusion praise the name of our Lord and they can also give the same testimony we can also give the same testimony that because our names are written in heaven that's why we've had the voice of this message come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins we heard praise the name of our Lord because our names were written in heaven so we had the ability to hear the voice of God praise the name of like the mother eag is the name of Lord Brother gives that story of of an eag which lay an egg and now when it laid somewhere then the hand also laid eggs and then that egg was put together with those of the hand handed and then now this small eag was among the cheeks denominational kind of you know Believers and so now the mother would teach this scratch and so this e would try but it was hard you know being kind of trying to accustomed in the religious systems baptism in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost baptism of little children that's in the praise the name of the Lord women preachers that is in the women putting men's clothes that is in the you know women bleaching themselves and all kind of things in the and theet was held up in that kind ofation but one day the mother e was flying over that place and then started screaming and then small ego had a voice which is identical to it and then it flew away praise the name of the Lord he that to him shall be given more praise the name of the Lord now in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ he says it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that this means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with a prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God so God gives us that ability to hear from him a special class of people who are those special classes of people whose names were written in heaven like we read in the book of Acts chapter 13 the Jews were contradicting and baming after the preaching of the word and they rejected it but now when Gentiles heart they received it with all their heart praise the name of now in theim church age he says he that has here let him here singular he what the spirit says to the churches notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word of that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by the Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within the range of the message though it is broadcast to all who come to the the range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way it's received individually [Music] by a certain cified group each individual of that group is the one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the of the messenger praise the name of Lord so there's a special class of people there is a special people God hased praise the name of the Lord all the Earth there are people God has selected praise the name of our Lord who has ordained to eternal life and their names are written in heaven their names are written in the lambus Book of Life they are the people who have the ability to hear what the spirit is saying praise the name of our Lord and so godain that is only those people who will receive the word of God praise the name of the Lord those are the people who have praise the name of the Lord the Bible says he that has praise the name of our Lord my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life so it doesn't matter what the devil may try to mess around with you if your name is written in heaven praise the name of the Lord you will hear praise the name of our Lord and you will be quickened praise the name of our Lord you hear and you'll be quickened the same thing with Daniel Daniel had men somewhere and then an earthquake came and men took off for them they stopped at the earthquake but Daniel had the voice so even when we come into the services of the Lord like now are you hearing praise the name of or maybe you got I don't even what they were talking about I don't know what this thing was meaning we need to the ability to hear praise the name of our Lord and until we have the ability to hear that's how we can be converted that's how praise the name of the Lord you can understand and then know this is mine praise the name of the Lord you know it's just like when God you know when Moses was weing on the herob mountain and then he saw the fire and then he said let me look at the fire the fire attracted his attention and then when he went then the voice said this is a Holy Ground remove your shoes and now when God saw that his attention was attracted he called him by name Moses Moses Moses m praise the name of our Lord and that's what the Gospel of Jesus Christ does to us it calls us by name praise the name of Lord so when you hear your name in other words it has been revealed to you that your name is written in heaven praise the name of our Lord then it quickens you it brings your conversion you know where you are converted praise the name of our Lord so there is no way outside of the word for you to know your name is written if it doesn't come by Revelation praise the name of the Lord now in the message the P Church age did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that an an individual hear what the spirit says to the church the spirit gives the word he that has the truth for each age each H has had its own El and that elect group already heard the word and received it proving that they had the seed in them praise the name of the Lord every El in their age they had the word which the spirit was saying and then they received that word they received the word as their portion praise the name of our and we have also received the word of God as our portion and the word we have received you know let us allow that word to trans transform us to change our thinking to change our speech to change our character so that the word of God May mold us into the image of Jesus Christ because he's coming for a church without spot or wrinkle so the word that we receive washes us sanctifies us and makes us to be into the image of Christ it takes away all your blemishes it takes away all you know your kind of spots and then it takes away anything that is contrary to God praise the name of our and then in John 8 ver 47 and he he that is of god Heth God's word read you therefore hear them not because you are not of God they refuse the word Jesus and his words for their days but the TR seat received the word because they were of God praise the name of so when you receive the word it means you are of God it means you have he that praise the name of our all thy children shall be told of God Holy Spirit that's Isaiah 54:3 Jesus said the same thing in John 6:4 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit fill no other Criterion praise the name of our Lord so if you have the word and you are one with the word you are of God and you spirit filled there's no other way to prove that the now the message he says now here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead and the Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manif in the flesh those Eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become the seit by the rebirth we were SE and we are reborn for only the elect can be reborn praise the name of the Lord say the new praise the name of the Lorden it is only the elect it's only the Elise the name of Lord only the elect that can be born again if one is not an elect can never be born again it's only those whose names were written in the numbers Book of Life are the only people who can be born again they come from God and then they go back to God but then they are putting the manifestation of this flesh during this time praise the name of our so the new birth does not make any person the seed of God it's only those who we seed in God and the only people can be born again those are the people who have he that has what do you have my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life what do you have have been ordained to eternal life what do you have I come from God and I go back to God what do you have praise the name of our Lord I come from God so I have now because I come from God then I have the ability that seed inside of me quickens me when the word of God comes me so when the word comes you receive the word praise the name of our Lord like the woman at the she was living in prostitution she was a Samar said you tell us to go to Jerusalem toship and for us she was just in that kind of mess but now when the word came to her and then revealed her nature of life she said when the Messiah come he will tell us these things she was a seed praise the name of the Lord seed buried in the concrete of prosecution but as long as the light goes to that seed praise the name of Lord like when you get a seed and then put it on concrete allow a small of light to go where the seed is you'll see the the plant coming down below the concrete coming up when you hear your name praise the name of when you hear the word of God calling your name it doesn't matter the condition you are in you just respond Here I Am Lord that woman responded to the call she left her Port there and then she ran to the city and then she said come and see the man who has told me everything about my life praise the name he that praise the name of our Lord God ordained us to eternal life so he has given us the ability to hear the word praise the name of our Lord now let us go back as I try to finish and then verse 11 he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not [Music] given says it is given to us praise the name of our Lord then he says forever has shall be given so we have our names written in the Lamb's Book of Life so we are given the ability to hear the word and because we have the ability to hear the word then it is revealed to us and when it is revealed to us then we can be born again and when you are born again you become a living Fountain praise the name of the Lord and the fountain it keeps on flowing flowing flowing so he says you will have more abundance you know more will be added unto you every other day you just need to say Lord I need more of you hungering and thirsting for righteousness Lord I need more of you fill my cup Lord let it keep it keep it flowing let it run over and over praise the name of the Lord because we can never exhaust God so he keeps on pouring refreshing you every other day praise the name of our Lord the Holy Spirit keeps on speaking to you the Holy Ghost keeps on talking to you even when you are weak the Holy Ghost comes down and then he renews your strength he's giving you more abundan more abundan when TRS come the Holy Ghost comes down and gives you courage he gives you encouragement he gives you strength he keeps on making you move forward sometimes you may F many things but the Holy Ghost comes and raises you up as an advocate in your infirmities he keeps on coming praise the name of the Lord you are receiving more abundan and more of God as we move in the journey the more of God keeps on coming praise the name of our Lord we just need to desire the more of the Lord every day you raise up in the morning you just glorify God than God for what he has done commit your way to the Lord Lord lead me through today Lord take me through today give me the ability to overcome provide for all my needs and then he watches over you the whole day and then when you come back home in the evening you still thank God I thank you thank you for what you have done in my life today thank you for providing for my needs thank you for directing me thank you for protecting me he keeps on giving us more and more Revelation upon Revelation Glory unto Glory glory and then you keep on moving on moving on moving on and the whole thing is to bring us into the image of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord now let us finish with 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and the Bible says verse let us from verse 16 [Music] 2 Corinthians 3: 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now he says when the heart shall turn to the Lord your heart that's where the Gen seed of life is so when your heart turns to the Lord then the ve of the things of the world disappear the veil of the things that happen in the Affairs of this life our cultures our Traditions our education our kind of upbringing which is contrary to the word they all disappear when our hearts turn to the Lord then he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is Le Liberty when the spirit of the Lord is in you the Bible says we have not received the spirit of fear but we have been received the spirit of adoption you know as sons of God then Verse 18 but we all with an open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image now he says we are changed in the same image from glory to glory even as by The Same Spirit of the lord we need to Contin beholding in the glass and the glass is the word keep on receiving the word Keep On Believing the word keep on obeying the word then you are changed from glory to glory praise the name of our Lord from one level to another level praise the name of our Lord so you have a clear understanding of what the Lord is doing in your life you become established praise the name of our Lord you don't run after things which are not having any foundation but you have been established in the present truth that God has given unto us praise the name of our he that has praise the name of our Lord our names are written in heaven praise the name of the Lord so he has given us the ability to hear from him and when we hear from him when we receive that word it transforms our
