[0:00] I wouldn't want a situation
[0:02] when the pastor changes Dimensions
[0:07] amen change his Dimensions
[0:11] amen Amina then the younger men that are
[0:14] presented
[0:15] as who is going to take over
[0:18] our sons
[0:26] foreign
[0:32] [Music]
[0:38] [Music]
[0:40] and then those tribes that were around
[0:44] the beginning
[0:47] [Music]
[0:50] all this kind of tries to come and
[0:54] torment them
[0:57] and then the Bible says then God would
[1:01] descend them and
[1:04] God was with that church
[1:18] [Music]
[1:29] we want a church where every family has
[1:34] got access to God
[1:36] are you together with it what is it
[1:39] they've got access to God
[1:41] so I feel good
[1:44] when I'm talking to families
[1:48] part of the church
[2:00] you are the ones that make the strong
[2:03] Foundation of a church
[2:09] but when the Book of Judges is starting
[2:14] the foundations that have been swept
[2:16] down almost
[2:23] whatever was right in their owners
[2:30] now it's come to pass in the days when
[2:34] the judges ruled
[2:35] that there was a famine in the land and
[2:39] the certain man of Bethel limited
[2:43] went to Saturn in the country
[2:50] [Music]
[2:52] and his true sons
[2:54] that was the moment of humility of
[2:57] humiliation
[3:01] that was the situation
[3:04] could not rise over
[3:07] um
[3:10] foreign
[3:21] [Music]
[3:36] [Music]
[3:42] no it's the situation better it cannot
[3:47] be handled
[3:48] moments of humility
[3:51] in our marriage
[3:58] and we're not even out escorted with the
[4:01] scriptures
[4:05] but the man has lost a job
[4:10] we need to put our hands together
[4:12] in the moments of security
[4:15] and entered the moments of Prayer
[4:22] if we know those as principles singer
[4:26] my name is
[4:44] the more we distance God from ourselves
[4:49] and we block our prayers
[4:53] but second Chronicles
[4:56] chapter 7 verse 13.
[5:01] if I shut up heaven foreign
[5:31] [Music]
[5:37] [Music]
[5:53] [Music]
[6:00] we keep God away from our families
[6:04] when we fight over situation
[6:08] which we have no control
[6:11] is
[6:12] calling us to humility
[6:15] that we may be able to pray together
[6:18] [Music]
[6:26] and went to Milwaukee
[6:29] amen
[6:32] America and the two of his sons
[6:35] [Music]
[6:38] died there
[6:43] situations like that
[6:46] I told him I told him
[6:50] but he had no man at the time
[6:55] and maybe the child he died
[6:58] that's an extreme case
[7:04] there's a situations that will just put
[7:07] us in moments of humidity
[7:10] rather than separate ourselves
[7:14] the two sons died
[7:18] incidentally was able to get truth
[7:24] so that she came back
[7:28] with Ruth a gentile um
[7:33] [Music]
[7:40] being grafted in the Hebrew Vines
[7:47] amen Amina it took life
[7:52] the two boys couldn't come back
[7:57] couldn't come back
[8:00] but at the end of the day all things
[8:04] work together
[8:06] amen
[8:08] was able to get rude
[8:12] and because of near me
[8:15] [Music]
[8:20] are you together foreign
[8:30] [Music]
[8:50] [Music]
[9:01] foreign
[9:05] [Music]
[9:48] why does this happen right now why does
[9:51] this
[9:56] and you have no answer
[9:59] but we understand it better together
[10:04] [Music]
[10:09] you keep telling your husband will
[10:12] understand it better together
[10:21] keep that sweet spirit
[10:24] that God will come down the quicker in
[10:28] due time
[10:30] okay let me identify the title
[10:35] when God speaks to women
[10:39] amen so that you'll be able to
[10:42] understand
[10:42] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[10:46] we have always taught the man is the
[10:49] head of the family is
[10:52] by the way God established it
[10:56] first Corinthians
[11:00] but I would have you know
[11:03] that the head of every man is Christ
[11:10] and the head of the woman is the man
[11:16] and the head of Christ is
[11:21] so the order is
[11:26] then God in Christ
[11:30] foreign
[12:12] foreign
[12:32] [Music]
[12:46] [Music]
[12:59] [Music]
[13:14] [Music]
[13:21] foreign
[13:24] [Music]
[13:40] [Music]
[13:49] [Music]
[14:15] [Music]
[14:21] got it so when this logos takes your
[14:24] body
[14:25] we see Jesus the Christ or Crystal
[14:30] amen Amina he is the headship of the
[14:33] Christian men yes
[14:36] by giving them a portion of his spirit
[14:41] that prayerful becomes the wisdom
[14:45] knowledge
[14:47] by which man becomes the head of the
[14:50] woman
[14:53] Hallelujah a man without Christ
[14:57] is not a man under the headship
[15:02] so it is
[15:07] then Christ takes the mind of the man
[15:10] and the man uses the mind of God
[15:13] [Music]
[15:14] to lead his wife
[15:21] [Music]
[15:39] so he certainly the Man in Christ
[15:43] that can have a stable Christian
[15:47] marriage
[15:51] because
[15:54] the one which takes Dominion Eternity
[15:57] for God
[15:59] it's not this man tell me I don't know
[16:03] but the Christ on the inside question
[16:08] who wants to marry
[16:10] must look for Christ I don't know your
[16:13] question in the mind not looking for an
[16:17] American height
[16:21] you lose the game
[16:25] somewhere
[16:27] now
[16:30] let's see we've got solutions to this
[16:34] problem
[16:36] I'm sure Martin didn't hear that
[16:42] you see but all unrestored men are
[16:47] outside
[16:55] [Music]
[17:01] by Menace
[17:04] gramatika because
[17:06] I told you what
[17:08] because there's no true story
[17:11] but the restaurant
[17:13] has the spirit of Christ I know my wife
[17:16] with the sweetness that it gives them
[17:20] [Music]
[17:23] are you together
[17:24] but men who have not been restored
[17:30] they've gone through by Menace
[17:35] the first in Genesis chapter 1 of course

[17:42] who was blessed through
[17:49] replenisha fill the Earth
[17:54] have dominion Buffalo but in the
[17:57] spiritual room
[18:00] so when your husband and wife you are
[18:03] together
[18:04] and you were born again
[18:08] marches were in this flesh
[18:11] but the Covenant of Genesis 1.
[18:15] puts that marriage together

[19:43] Fallen man
[19:46] that are not restored to the first
[19:48] Covenant
[19:51] will control by Menace
[19:55] by that form of teaching
[19:58] the woman will prone in fear hey
[20:04] in order to maintain her marriage
[20:08] and they'll teach them that the woman
[20:12] must maintain her existence in the man's
[20:16] home
[20:19] and she becomes a beggar for love many
[20:26] marriage
[20:28] was intended to be for the children of
[20:30] God
[20:33] build back the kingdom okay
[20:38] okay
