========================================

Chicago are you together with me so this was David and he was under a new testament anointing teaching us but after the Ascension of Christ even without the new birth that is not Romans 10 17. is using that type of thing in Romans 10 17. when he specifically dealing with the new birth even in this message and it causes them to evaluated to ridicule the Teaching Ministry foreign [Music] foreign amen I mean where the brand I'm according to say but teaching blesses a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith that is foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign why does God allow this anointing and he says to the rebellious why would God allow it right chapter 13. he spoke also this parable [Applause] Monty certain but anyway planted in his Vineyard and salt fruits who is the vineyard planter now but the Lord Jesus Christ and his emphasis is the fruitful tree but then on this particular one the parable is trying to explain the situation he says let me cut it down then say that he entered the dresser behold these three years I come seeking fruits on this fig tree and finance foreign they were getting around this month to protect him because he's in the company let us get him down because he's bearing no fruits answering say that to him again let it alone let us do everything possible let it benefit from the children's food Hallelujah you know the children's Foods [Applause] let them benefits foreign are you together with amazing amen Amina that tree Taps you to the miracle ministry first to see the greater purpose [Applause] of signs and wonders there must be a voice amen amen they just want to tap into the anointing they don't want to get into the teachers we want to see Power to endure Hallelujah you remember the other Sunday perfect strength imperfect weakness the strength of everything that stands amen Amina so down here foreign [Music] that's their qualification chapter 7 verse 22. he says man I will say unto me in that day Lord have we not prophesied in thy name it was a true anointing that they tapped into and in the name of cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful words that worked iniquity foreign I never knew you because you never came into the inner chamber um foreign we want to speak you cannot be saved without faith he says yes but a different type of Faith that's the one I want to speak about we've seen all this type of Faith but he's talking about the perfect Faith now a different type of Faith a Saving Face meaning that Romans 10 17. he's dealing with a supernatural face which is the face of Jesus Christ the one that says and produces the fruit in the life of that and once you have this type of faith it will bring victories [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the disciples didn't have it till they went to Pentecost but remember they cast out demons by tapping into the anointing but they didn't have that phrase don't dispute that is because the Bible says they even rebellious foreign in the perfect Faith he says now now we see remember that at first okay the disciples did just didn't have this perfect face Did they perform signs yes they did but perfect faith is another type of Faith amen Amina they didn't have it because they are Christ walking with him but then afterwards Christ was in the pressure and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it up come on amen are you together with him what is it it is your personal Pentacles that gives this kind of faith is classified to hold that for example Amen in the government government we've got what we call classified documents nobody knows about them if they find you with classified you go to court or yamukoti this face is classified amen Amina it's classified let's go to Revelation 2 17. the scripture says he that has an ear foreign and I want you to listen very well we are trying to get to the bottom of this type of Faith which is because this faith is you have got to pass God has ordained foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] will bear a certain depth of foreign yeah amen Amina yeah and that one there will also be fruitful and you'll bear fruits he says I'll give you a spiritual certificate certification how much one more year because you have eaten hallelujah praise God I'll give him a white stone and in this town that is white in nature speaks about the Revelation upon which the church is a white Foundation it is [Applause] overcome it changes [Applause] a new way of life are you together with me so this phrase cannot be exchanged because this is the phrase that gives the token and that's why in the separation of the wise and fools they needed some of the face [Applause] [Music] you know foreign [Music] foreign [Music] a belief system so brother brothers let's go to Ephesians one night he said having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which has purposed in himself which is not being programmed today was purposed in him he was the foundation of the world so therefore this Faith helps you to touch and understand after reading that scripture brother Branham says the mystery of his way now it's not just a little thing it is a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or herself God's mystery how do we find out foreign [Applause] whatever [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] in the mystery of his wife [Applause] you are standing in the path of faith troubles will come but you are anointed to overcome [Applause] amen they literally were taken out of this Dimension by Death [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign gotten to the bank of life but perfect faith will say healing is realize [Music] and sometimes they cut off your legs but healing is that foreign didn't have the faith but the grace going through that was also faith yeah amen amenities foreign foreign so without a true New Birth you can never catch the right direction of faith faith is the revelation of God's perfect week and that's why Faith had a different renderings in Hebrews 11. because God's perfect twins [Applause] God gave him the kind of faith that was good enough but the path that he had given him amen we all have the past work congratulations in this [Applause] in Hebrew that God has chosen foreign [Applause] amen Amina praise God yes sir so my brother I want us to Define this Faith to fully understand this Faith this Faith here is described in Romans chapter 10 and verse 17. in this chapter here foreign a man Believers unto righteousness and with the mouth confessions made at Salvation for the scripture says shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord our faith that doesn't discriminate or quick it is [Music] how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed in you of whom they foreign foreign so unless you have that SIM card okay unless you've got the city unless you've been a part of God before the foundation of the world but the moment you hear I always want you here translates directly [Applause] into the face that the Lord yes foreign so he says when they put the Life of Christ when you have the faith of Jesus Christ then the party of Jesus Christ then the knowledge of Jesus Christ so that at that particular time that Faith a quicker is open brings down the Life of Christ and you can say but Christ that lives and then the prophet says according to that question then the bride we don't know Muslim people represented by Christ no question meaning that the bride together is the Peace of Christ himself which has got the ability to listen to the bright group and then builds the nature of the husband and as it builds the nature of the house among the work is no longer I take a reason but Christine you see what perfect Faith does it doesn't stop on that it can go for your transformation things begin to change are you together with me you totally begin to change and what happens begins to build rupturing Grace in our lives rupturing Grace is in this message are you together yeah you just submit where are you and then and then all of a sudden the stream comes through those who believe me out of them rivers of Living Water [Music] that you are born again you have perfect faith so just submit yourself into the message give yourself time into that message that's what will change it yes sir just subject to yourself where are you amen Amina do you know what Abram did against faith I mean I guess so against hope he believed in Hope yeah are you together with him with a few proposals your face will be true but if it's a revelation against hope you believe in hope that never comes and says because the word is revelation to you are you together with them do you have perfect Faith perfect faith in all sectors of Faith because it's Christ because through the instrumentality hello [Music] [Applause] you just say foreign [Music] [Applause] Amina let's get on our feet [Music] Everlasting [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] I'm leaningly I'm leading me holding on the Everlast oh I'm leaning with our
