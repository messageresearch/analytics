[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] Jesus for my
[0:05] cleansing. This I
[0:09] see nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[0:17] Oh my
[0:20] pardon this my
[0:23] plea. Nothing but the blood of
[0:29] Jes. Oh
[0:32] precious. Oh
[0:35] precious is the
[0:38] flow
[0:40] that makes me white as snow.
[0:47] No
[0:49] other fountain I
[0:53] know nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[0:59] [Music]
[1:02] Nothing can
[1:05] foresee not
[1:08] to nothing but the blood of
[1:15] Jesus. Lord of good that I have
[1:23] done nothing but the blood of
[1:29] Jes. Oh
[1:31] precious, oh
[1:34] precious is the
[1:37] flow
[1:39] that makes me white as
[1:45] snow.
[1:47] No
[1:49] other fountain. I
[1:52] know nothing but the blood of
[1:57] [Music]
[2:04] Jesus. Let us sing that song as we
[2:07] prepare to talk to the
[2:09] Lord. Song number
[2:11] 113. Leave it there.
[2:18] If the word from you
[2:21] withhold of its silver and its gold and
[2:26] you have to get along with a major
[2:32] f just remember in his world how he
[2:37] feeds the little bird. Take your burdens
[2:42] to the Lord and leave it there. Leave it
[2:46] there.
[2:50] Leave it there. Take your balance to the
[2:54] Lord and leave it
[2:58] there. If you trust and never doubt, he
[3:04] will surely bring you out. Take your
[3:08] burdens to the Lord and leave it there.
[3:15] If your body suffers pain and your
[3:19] health you can't
[3:21] regain and your soul is almost seeking
[3:26] in
[3:29] despair. Jesus knows the pain you feel.
[3:34] He can save and he can heal. Take your
[3:39] burdens to the Lord.
[3:43] Just leave it there. Leave it there.
[3:48] Leave it there. Take your bings to the
[3:53] Lord and leave it.
[3:57] Just if you trust and never doubt, he
[4:02] will surely bring you out. Take your
[4:07] burdens to the Lord and leave it. Just
[4:12] leave them there. Leave it there. Leave
[4:16] it there. Take your burdens to the Lord
[4:21] and leave it
[4:23] [Music]
[4:25] there. If you trust and never doubt, he
[4:30] will surely bring you out. Take your
[4:35] burdens to the Lord and leave it there.
[4:40] Start to speak to the Lord. Start to
[4:43] talk to him. Lord Jesus, we thank you
[4:45] for your grace.
[4:47] Lord, you've given us unto us, Lord, to
[4:50] come into your presence, Lord. You said,

[4:56] means, Lord. We are more than three,
[4:58] Lord Jesus. And we are calling upon your
[5:00] name, Lord. We've not come to converse,
[5:02] Lord. We've not come to visit one
[5:04] another, Lord Jesus, or to look at a
[5:07] frame, Lord. But we've come, Lord Jesus,
[5:09] to obtain favor, Lord. We have come in
[5:12] the throne of mercy. We've come with
[5:14] boldness, Lord, to hear, Father, Lord

[12:47] same mind of Jesus
[12:50] Christ like it's written let let this
[12:53] mind be in
[12:55] you as it was also Jesus Christ as we
[12:59] take up thy word
[13:01] tonight May this
[13:05] father as it was in Jesus
[13:08] Christ. We pray heavenly father that you
[13:11] may lead us all
[13:13] through their
[13:15] service. Bless our
[13:18] hearts. Heal those that are
[13:21] sick. Strengthen those that are
[13:24] wearing. Father, give us
[13:27] hope for
[13:29] tomorrow. We love you and we thank you.
[13:32] in the most precious
[13:34] name we
[13:36] pray. Amen.
[13:39] Amen. May God bless
[13:42] you. Great to be here
[13:45] tonight. Amen. Amen. I want to
[13:48] appreciate
[13:50] God who has enabled each one of

[14:00] the presence of our
[14:03] pastor. Amen. Amen. So it's always
[14:09] unusual. Feels
[14:12] unusual. It always feels
[14:16] unusual to stand before you. It's not a

[14:44] us. We pray that the Lord We believe
[14:47] that the Lord will use us.
[14:50] to speak to your hearts
[14:52] tonight. Let's turn to Deuteronomy
[14:58] 12 and read from verse one to verse two.
[15:13] These are the statutes and judgments
[15:16] which ye shall observe to do in the
[15:18] land, which the Lord God of thy fathers
[15:22] of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it
[15:25] all the days that you live upon the
[15:28] earth.
[15:46] You shall utterly destroy all the places
[15:48] where in the nations which you shall
[15:51] possess served their gods upon the high
[15:54] mountains and upon the hills and under
[15:56] every green tree. Okay. Verse two
[16:01] [Music]
[16:09] says,
[16:13] Fore! Foreign!
[16:23] Foreign! Verse.
[16:54] 10
[16:56] But when you go over Jordan and dwell in
[16:58] the land which the Lord your God giveth
[17:02] giveth you to inherit, and when he
[17:04] giveth you rest from all your enemies
[17:07] round about so so that you shall dwell
[17:11] safe in safety.
[17:23] [Music]
[17:38] Then there shall be a place which the
[17:41] Lord your God shall choose to cause his
[17:44] name to dwell there. There shall you
[17:47] bring all that I command you, your burnt
[17:50] offerings and your sacrifices, your
[17:53] tithes, and the heave offering of your
[17:55] hand, and all your choice bowls which
[17:59] you vote unto the Lord.
[18:36] No, no,
[18:45] May the Lord bless his word. We may get
[18:49] seated. Amen. Amen. So for a title
[18:54] tonight, I want to speak on
[18:58] worship. Where did God choose man?
[19:04] Where did
[19:06] God where did God choose to meet with
[19:08] man?
[19:13] Praise the Lord. where in the book of
[19:17] Deuteronomy in verse
[19:21] 11, the Bible has said,
[19:24] you see, God was giving them
[19:29] instructions, what they have to
[19:31] do, when they reach in
[19:34] Canaan, when they possess the promised
[19:39] land, what were they going to do?
[19:43] Praise the Lord. Because we know that
[19:45] the purpose of their
[19:49] movement, why God moved them from
[19:53] Egypt, he wanted them to worship
[19:57] him. He wanted to have fellowship with
[20:02] them. Praise the Lord. So now where in
[20:05] the book of
[20:06] Deuteronomy when he spoke to them, he
[20:10] told them when you go over
[20:13] Jordan and dwell in the
[20:16] land which the Lord your God gives you
[20:19] to
[20:22] inherit. And when he gives you rest from
[20:25] all your enemies round about
[20:30] you so that you dwell in safety,
[20:34] Then he said, "Then there shall be a
[20:38] place which the Lord your God shall
[20:40] choose to cause his name to dwell
[20:46] there." While he had given them the
[20:48] entire
[20:49] land, he was
[20:53] specific. He never asked them to get a
[20:57] place to worship him.
[21:00] Praise the Lord. He never said you go
[21:02] and set up a place for me to
[21:07] worship. But he said when you get
[21:10] there, when you are free from your
[21:15] enemies, in other words, when you have
[21:19] overcome, he said, then there shall be a
[21:24] place. In other words, I shall give you
[21:26] a place.
[21:29] He says, "Which the Lord your God shall
[21:33] choose to cause his name to dwell
[21:37] there." And he says, "There shall you
[21:40] bring all that I command
[21:45] you." And then he begins to tell them
[21:47] what they ought to bring in that
[21:50] place. And in verse
[21:53] 12, "And you shall rejoice before the
[21:56] Lord your God,
[22:00] He and your
[22:01] sons and your daughters and your men
[22:05] servants and your maid
[22:07] servants and the
[22:10] Levite within your gates.
[22:13] as much as he hath no part nor
[22:15] inheritance with
[22:20] you. Take heed to
[22:23] thyself that thou offer not thy burnt
[22:26] offerings in every place that thou
[22:35] seeest. So he has a specific place that
[22:38] he was choosing.
[22:42] He had chosen a
[22:44] place and so he was giving them
[22:48] instructions. As much as you are
[22:51] free from your
[22:53] enemies, as much as I have called you to
[22:56] worship
[22:58] me, you're not going to worship
[23:01] me according to your own
[23:05] desires. These are the
[23:07] instructions that I give unto you to
[23:10] follow.
[23:11] as you come to worship
[23:14] me. So he says you shall not go to any
[23:17] place that you
[23:21] see. You shall not offer your burnt
[23:24] offerings in every place that thou
[23:30] seeest in the place which the Lord shall
[23:33] choose in one of thy
[23:38] tribes. There thou shalt offer thy burnt
[23:44] offerings. There thou shalt do all that
[23:47] I command
[23:50] thee? It had to be a specific
[23:54] place. So now which place did God
[23:58] choose for man to worship
[24:02] him? Let's turn over Deuteronomy chapter
[24:06] 16 verse one and two.
[24:11] He says, "Observe the month of
[24:16] Abib," that's the month of
[24:20] April, "and keep the Passover unto the
[24:23] Lord thy
[24:25] God. For in the month of the Lord thy
[24:29] God brought thee forth out of Egypt by
[24:31] night,
[24:41] Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
[24:45] Passover unto the Lord thy God,
[24:49] one of the flock and the
[24:52] heart in the place which the Lord shall
[24:56] choose to place his name there.
[25:02] He was very specific even for the
[25:06] [Music]
[25:09] Passover. You shall not make these
[25:12] sacrifices in every place that thou
[25:15] seeest.
[25:19] But even for the
[25:22] Passover, thou shalt
[25:26] sacrifice only in the
[25:28] place which the Lord shall choose to
[25:32] place his name
[25:35] there. He had to choose a place for them
[25:38] to meet
[25:41] him. Praise the
[25:43] Lord. Ask them to choose for themselves.
[25:48] but he chose a place for
[25:50] them. He said he would place his name
[25:55] there. So that place would not only be a
[25:58] place of
[26:00] worship, it would also bear the name of
[26:03] the
[26:05] Lord to identify the person of
[26:10] God. So he instituted these spiritual
[26:13] events in the Bible.
[26:17] He instituted spiritual events.
[26:28] And then there were days dedicated to
[26:34] worship to commemorate their
[26:38] victories. But in there he said he would
[26:43] choose a place
[26:46] Praise the Lord. And then the people
[26:49] would come to that
[26:50] place, worship him, offer
[26:55] thanksgiving,
[26:57] offerings, and the rest of
[26:59] them. In the Bible, right from the
[27:04] beginning, God has always had a special
[27:07] place that he
[27:10] chooses. Rather he gives
[27:13] instruction on the mode and order of
[27:18] worship. Praise the Lord. We have seen
[27:21] that
[27:21] worship even in the Old
[27:24] Testament was not done in every
[27:27] place. But there was a special place
[27:30] that God chose for people to meet and
[27:32] worship him
[27:36] there. Let me quote in the message God
[27:39] is chosen place of worship.
[27:44] The prophet makes a statement and
[27:47] says,
[27:48] "Now God told
[27:51] them when they before they established
[27:54] the
[27:55] temple and whatever they
[27:58] did, I will choose the place of my
[28:03] worship and I will put my name in
[28:06] it." And that's the only place that God
[28:09] would ever meet
[28:14] anybody was by his own
[28:18] choosing was by his own
[28:21] choosing. He chose his
[28:25] place. And where he chose his
[28:30] place, he put his
[28:33] name. Praise the Lord. He would put his
[28:36] name in the
[28:37] place. He would put his name in the
[28:41] place that he had chosen for people to
[28:44] worship him
[28:47] in. Not any other
[28:50] place. Has always been
[28:54] specific on where to meet
[28:57] him. Praise the Lord. He has always been
[29:01] specific on where and how man would meet
[29:06] him. Let's get over to the temple of
[29:09] Solomon.
[29:12] The temple that Solomon built for the
[29:15] Lord. God gave
[29:18] instructions. He was very specific on
[29:20] how this temple would be
[29:24] built because it was the temple of the
[29:27] Lord.
[29:29] where the ark of the Lord would be
[29:34] kept. And when he was giving
[29:37] instructions, he had three courts that
[29:39] he
[29:42] specified that this temple would be
[29:45] comprised
[29:48] of. Praise the Lord. And he gave the
[29:50] measurements of
[29:53] each. Praise the Lord. And now there
[29:56] were the there was the first court.
[30:00] which was the outer
[30:02] court. And then there was the middle
[30:05] court, the second court. And then there
[30:08] was the the innermost
[30:12] court, which was the holy of
[30:16] holies. And each of the three courts
[30:19] were for a
[30:21] purpose. But the purpose of it
[30:25] all, praise the Lord, was for the people
[30:28] to meet God
[30:31] there and have fellowship with
[30:34] him. Praise the Lord. But then these
[30:37] three
[30:39] courts, you know, it was an event once
[30:42] in a
[30:44] year that the people often
[30:48] gathered to bring their
[30:50] sins. Praise the Lord. And so they would
[30:53] bring their
[30:55] sins and the high priests would enter
[30:58] into the innermost
[31:02] court, accept the the petitions of the
[31:07] people. Praise the Lord. Now the purpose
[31:10] of this
[31:12] event was to make the people repent of
[31:16] their
[31:20] sins and reconcile with
[31:23] God so they could continue to have
[31:26] fellowship with him without
[31:31] sin. Praise the Lord. But I want us to
[31:34] keep in
[31:35] mind that all these things
[31:39] Right from where we read from
[31:42] Deuteronomy that they are a
[31:45] shadow of something that was to
[31:49] come. Praise the Lord. Remember God had
[31:52] chosen a place for
[31:55] himself. And he said, "I will put my
[31:57] name there."
[32:00] And then when he speaks to
[32:02] David about the
[32:04] temple, praise the Lord, he gives clear
[32:09] instructions. Then when Solomon came to
[32:11] build the
[32:13] temple, follow the instructions that God
[32:16] had
[32:19] given. And Solomon was very
[32:22] careful to keep every letter of the
[32:25] words of the instructions that God had
[32:27] given.
[32:31] So now when he con he constructed the
[32:34] entire
[32:36] temple. Now there was the three courts
[32:38] that I talked
[32:40] about there are three distinct
[32:44] courts each serving a specific
[32:50] purpose. Praise the Lord. You can find
[32:52] it in the book of 2 Coronicles.
[32:57] this 2 Coronicles.
[33:02] Praise the Lord. The first five or seven
[33:05] chapters.
[33:08] Praise the Lord. The first
[33:10] court which the Bible calls the outer
[33:14] court. Here the people
[33:18] gathered. All the people
[33:22] gathered. All walks of life.
[33:28] Whoever was convicted of
[33:31] [Music]
[33:32] sin, whoever wanted to have freedom to
[33:40] worship, whoever wanted to have
[33:42] fellowship with
[33:46] God came to that
[33:48] place. Why? Because it was a place where
[33:52] they would carry all their sacrifices.
[33:57] the sacrifices that would be killed and
[33:59] sacrificed for their
[34:03] sins. Praise the Lord. And they gathered
[34:06] all at the outer
[34:09] court and the people waited
[34:11] there. Then they brought their
[34:14] offerings. They brought their
[34:17] sacrifices. In the book of
[34:19] Leviticus, the Bible talks about
[34:22] this that if a man is convicted of
[34:27] sin, he shall bring a a bullock.
[34:31] Praise the Lord. And then he would give
[34:34] to be offered for his
[34:38] sins. But it was a free
[34:42] will. People had been
[34:45] driven by a free
[34:49] will. Whoevers, let him
[34:52] come. Whoever wants to be reconciled,
[34:55] let him
[34:57] come. Whoever wants to be forgiven of
[34:59] their sins, let him
[35:02] come. That was the
[35:05] message. Praise the Lord. So, it had to
[35:08] take you to believe that message.
[35:12] feel the
[35:14] conviction. You they could not drag you
[35:17] to come
[35:18] there. You had to be by
[35:22] yourself in the outer
[35:25] court. So they came and gathered outside
[35:30] there. And now when they gathered
[35:33] there, carried along their
[35:36] sacrifices because each one had to carry
[35:39] a sacrifice.
[35:43] to die for their
[35:45] sins. Praise the Lord. And now when they
[35:48] were
[35:49] there, the priests
[35:52] gathered, the priests gathered in the
[35:55] middle
[35:58] court to receive the sacrifices of their
[36:04] people to receive the offering, the sin
[36:06] offerings of their
[36:09] people. So the people kept at the outer
[36:13] court. Praise the Lord. The Bible tells
[36:16] us in the book of Revelation
[36:21] 20:17 spirit and the bride say
[36:26] come. And let him that heareth say
[36:30] come. And let him that is a thirst
[36:34] come. You had to take a thirst for
[36:37] righteousness.
[36:42] It had to take a
[36:44] thirst to
[36:46] worship to come with the
[36:50] offering. Praise the Lord. So they came
[36:52] and gave to the priests.
[36:55] The Bible says whosoever
[36:59] will self
[37:02] will whoever hearth the
[37:05] word and is convicted of
[37:09] sin, let him
[37:11] come. Praise the Lord, that it was
[37:14] provided
[37:15] [Music]
[37:17] for in their day. But whoever
[37:21] wills, let him come. Let him take the
[37:26] water of life
[37:29] freely. So now we
[37:31] notice it was in the outer
[37:34] court. They accepted the
[37:37] call. They came because they were
[37:41] convicted. They wanted to live
[37:45] right. Praise the Lord. Maybe they had
[37:48] not heard of eternal life
[37:52] yet conviction for
[37:55] sin. They wanted to live
[38:00] right. So they gathered out
[38:03] there
[38:05] self-driven with a desire for
[38:09] righteousness, sighing in their
[38:13] hearts because they felt they were
[38:17] unworthy even to enter into the second
[38:22] place yet they desire to worship God
[38:27] in. So they came to offload their sins.
[38:32] and make confessions there upon their
[38:36] sacrifices. So this was a
[38:38] place of
[38:42] justification because whoever
[38:45] accepted they came and whoever came he
[38:50] offered his sin
[38:54] offering. mercy over their sin
[38:57] offering. They have accepted that they
[39:00] are sinners and they need to be
[39:06] redeemed. Praise the Lord. So now they
[39:09] came to present
[39:11] themselves. Whoever wills, let him
[39:14] come and take of this living water
[39:19] freely. A point of
[39:22] justification. Whoever
[39:25] believes, praise the Lord, whoever
[39:28] believes, John
[39:31] 3:16, God so loved the
[39:34] world that he gave his only begotten
[39:37] son.
[39:39] Whoever believes in
[39:42] him, whoever believes on him shall not
[39:47] perish shall have everlasting
[39:50] life. Shall be saved from
[39:54] death. Praise the Lord. So when you
[39:58] believe, you are
[40:00] justified. But you are not compelled to
[40:04] believe. It has to be a selfwill.
[40:10] Why? Because you need to be
[40:14] cleansed. You have recognized that
[40:16] you're a sinner and you need to be
[40:20] cleansed. You have accepted the
[40:22] invitation to be set
[40:26] free. So they believed and they came
[40:30] there. Here comes the second
[40:33] court in the inner
[40:36] court. And in the inner
[40:38] court, priests made sacrifices and burnt
[40:45] incense. While the people stood out in
[40:48] the outer
[40:50] court, witnessing the offering of their
[40:53] sacrifices for
[40:57] sin. So the priests offered the
[41:01] sacrifices and they pou the blood upon
[41:04] the altar.
[41:06] Praise the Lord for the washing of
[41:10] sin for the cleansing of
[41:13] sin. Praise the Lord. And intercessions
[41:16] were made from
[41:18] there as the people waited in the outer
[41:23] court. So now the
[41:26] cleansing, praise the Lord, was done in
[41:29] the middle
[41:30] court because they kept pouring this
[41:32] blood upon the
[41:35] altar. They pour the blood upon the
[41:37] altar.
[41:39] Praise the Lord. The blood of the sin
[41:43] offerings, the blood of the offerings of
[41:45] those that have brought them to be
[41:47] offered for their sins.
[41:52] And so now the middle
[41:54] court, there was a
[41:57] veil that separated the middle court
[42:00] from the inner the innermost
[42:05] court. And now the priest's
[42:08] work was to make these sacrifices and
[42:11] burnt
[42:15] incense and they were not allowed to
[42:17] enter into the innermost court.
[42:22] Because the innermost court was reserved
[42:25] only for the high
[42:28] priest because it was the holy of
[42:32] holies. It was the most sacred place of
[42:35] the
[42:39] tabernacle. So now we see two things
[42:43] here. We have seen the outer court and
[42:45] the middle court.
[42:48] All these were
[42:50] visible. The outer court the people were
[42:54] there and now the person that is coming
[42:57] to the middle
[43:00] court had to pass through the middle
[43:03] court from the outer court the middle
[43:08] court. Now in the innermost
[43:12] court there was only one door.
[43:17] And it was all
[43:19] covered protected by the
[43:23] cherubim and only the high priest was
[43:26] allowed to enter in
[43:30] there. Praise the Lord. And the says he
[43:33] entered there once in a
[43:37] year. People's petitions before
[43:41] God. Praise the Lord. So now the first
[43:44] court and the second court are
[43:49] visible but in the innermost
[43:53] courted from the rest of the
[43:58] people it is a sacred
[44:08] place. Praise the Lord. Only the high
[44:11] priest entered in there.
[44:15] Praise the living God. And now in there
[44:18] was the ark of the
[44:21] covenant which contain the tablets of
[44:23] the
[44:27] law and Aaron's
[44:29] ro and a jar of
[44:33] mana and God is shak glory dealt above
[44:37] the master seat.
[44:43] Praise the Lord. And around it was a
[44:49] curtain that separated the holy place
[44:51] from the holy of
[44:56] holies. Praise the Lord. And now in
[44:59] there each time the priest
[45:03] went the people waited from
[45:06] outside. They were waiting to see if God
[45:09] would accept their petitions or
[45:14] not. And they could not settle until the
[45:17] high priest came
[45:21] back because if he didn't come
[45:23] back, it would mean their sins have not
[45:26] been
[45:29] forgiven. So in all this we have seen
[45:32] that when God was giving
[45:35] instructions he reserved a most sacred
[45:39] place for
[45:43] himself. He provided for the outer
[45:46] court and then he provided for the
[45:49] middle
[45:50] court and so the rest of the
[45:53] people and priest ended in the middle
[45:58] court. But then there is this most
[46:01] sacred place in the holy of
[46:05] holies which was reserved only for God
[46:09] and the high
[46:12] priest. Praise the Lord. It was reserved
[46:16] for
[46:17] God. That's why when he was giving
[46:21] instruction he said I'll tell you where
[46:23] to go and worship me.
[46:28] set myself a
[46:30] place and in there I will put my
[46:34] name. Praise the Lord. And that's where
[46:37] you will meet
[46:39] me. So now in the Old
[46:42] Testament that was a
[46:45] shadow of something that was to
[46:48] come. So we still see that the three
[46:53] courts that comprise this temple
[46:57] Praise the Lord. Make up the temple of
[47:00] Solomon. We are all a shadow of
[47:05] something. Praise the Lord. Shadows of
[47:08] God's place of
[47:11] worship. A place that God would choose
[47:14] to meet man and be
[47:19] worshiped. Praise the Lord. And I want
[47:22] to say this that the three courts
[47:26] also represent Jesus Christ.
[47:30] Praise the Lord. Because now we have
[47:33] noticed that there were three
[47:35] courts and the first
[47:38] court which was the outer court, we all
[47:41] gathered
[47:43] there. We all brought our burdens
[47:46] there. In other words, each time we
[47:48] accepted to go
[47:51] there, it was the first symbol that we
[47:53] have accepted the
[47:57] message of
[48:00] redemption. So our sins would be
[48:04] forgiven. That is the point of of
[48:10] justification.
[48:12] Yes. Praise the Lord. And then in the
[48:15] middle
[48:16] court
[48:17] sacrifices blood is poured upon the
[48:21] altar. And what is the blood for? The
[48:24] blood is for
[48:27] sanctification. Praise the Lord. Then
[48:29] there is a reserved
[48:32] place which was full of
[48:35] life. The life of God himself.
[48:40] That's why when Aaron left his stick
[48:44] there, it received
[48:47] life and in that third
[48:50] place in the holy of holies was the life
[48:53] of God
[48:56] himself. And the Bible says there was
[48:58] the shakina glory
[49:02] there. The glory of God was in
[49:07] there. Praise the Lord. So now the three
[49:09] courts which represent
[49:15] justification the outer
[49:18] court sanctification in the middle
[49:22] court life
[49:25] eternal
[49:26] life the life of Christ
[49:29] himself which represents the baptism of
[49:32] the Holy
[49:34] Spirit. So now it represents the walk
[49:39] from
[49:40] justification, the receiving of the Holy
[49:44] Spirit. And now there is no way you
[49:47] would enter into the Holy of
[49:51] Holies unless you have been
[49:55] washed. Praise the Lord. And how are we
[49:59] washed? We are washed by the
[50:03] waters. Praise the Lord. There is a
[50:06] scripture that talks about
[50:09] that. I can get it
[50:12] here. Praise the Lord. I think it's
[50:17] in it's in the book of Ephesians 5
[50:24] 26. That he may sanctify and cleanse it
[50:27] with the washing of water by the
[50:31] word. Okay. that he may
[50:35] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[50:38] of water by the
[50:47] word. Praise the Lord.
[50:51] Justification then in the middle
[50:54] court where blood was was offered upon
[50:57] the
[50:59] altar where blood was sprinkled upon the
[51:02] altar.
[51:04] It was for
[51:07] cleansing and it symbolizes
[51:12] sanctification. And we know that blood
[51:14] is for
[51:16] atonement, atonement for our
[51:19] sins according to Hebrews chapter 9
[51:27] 11. Praise the Lord. Christ being come
[51:31] and high priest of good things to come
[51:33] by a greater and more perfect
[51:43] tabernacle.
[51:45] 911 91
[52:13] verse 19. For when Moses had spoken
[52:16] every precept to all the people
[52:18] according to the law, he took the blood
[52:20] of calves and of goats with water and
[52:23] scarlet wool and high and sprinkled both
[52:26] the book and all the people.
[52:46] [Music]
[52:58] [Music]
[53:02] saying, "This is the blood of of the
[53:04] testament which God has enjoined unto
[53:14] you. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood
[53:16] both the tabernacle and all the vessels
[53:18] of the ministry. Sorry.
[53:35] And almost all things are by the are by
[53:37] the law ped with blood. And without
[53:40] shedding of blood is no
[53:52] remission. So without blood there is no
[53:54] remission.
[53:59] So and in the middle court was blood
[54:02] poured upon the
[54:06] altar purpose of remitting the
[54:10] sins. But you know the Bible talks about
[54:13] it. The blood of bulls and goats could
[54:16] not remit people's
[54:21] sins. Could simply cover the sins.
[54:25] It was typing something that would come
[54:27] thereafter.
[54:31] And that was Jesus Christ.
[54:34] Praise the Lord. So now we've seen that
[54:37] the outer court, the middle court and
[54:38] the and the innermost
[54:41] court I typing the justific
[54:47] justification sanctification and then
[54:49] the Holy Spirit which is the life of
[54:51] God.
[54:56] Praise the Lord. And I want to say that
[54:58] these
[55:00] three also type the life of Jesus
[55:03] Christ.
[55:05] You see, when he died upon the
[55:08] cross, first of all, when he
[55:11] came, he gave us a
[55:14] message. He said,
[55:16] "Come, no man can see the
[55:19] father. No man can receive life.
[55:23] No man can enter into the holy of
[55:27] holies except he accepts my
[55:31] word. So in other words, he was standing
[55:35] in the door of the outer
[55:39] court, calling out the people to come to
[55:44] repentance. Praise the Lord. And then he
[55:46] would point the people to
[55:49] himself because he was the door to
[55:54] justification. And whoever believed
[55:57] him, they would be forgiven of their
[56:01] sins. And whoever believes him
[56:04] today is
[56:07] justified. Praise the Lord. You are
[56:10] justified when you believe on Jesus
[56:13] Christ because he stands at the
[56:17] door, the door to the
[56:21] tabernacle. That's why he says, "I am
[56:24] the
[56:25] door." He is the door to the
[56:29] tabernacle. You cannot enter into the
[56:32] middle court.
[56:36] You cannot enter into the middle
[56:40] court right now. You cannot
[56:43] enter through the middle court through
[56:46] the sanctification of your
[56:49] sins to be
[56:52] cleansed without passing through Jesus
[56:55] Christ. It has to be by Jesus
[57:00] Christ and through Jesus
[57:02] Christ get into the middle
[57:05] court where you receive the ministration
[57:08] of the
[57:10] word where the priests do the
[57:12] ministration of the
[57:14] word. Praise the Lord. Where they do the
[57:18] intercessions where there is
[57:21] intercessions for
[57:23] sin. Praise the living God. And so after
[57:27] you've entered through Jesus
[57:30] Christ by Jesus Christ's
[57:33] word, you now become a candidate to
[57:39] sanctification. Praise the Lord. Whoever
[57:41] wills let him come. So now you come and
[57:45] you accept
[57:46] him and then you go through him to the
[57:49] middle court.
[57:52] So without Jesus Christ there is no
[57:56] justification. The church cannot justify
[57:58] you of your
[58:01] sins. The priest, the pastor can not
[58:04] justify you of your
[58:08] sins. Your father, your mother cannot
[58:11] justify of your
[58:13] sins. Praise the Lord. They can all
[58:16] bring you to the
[58:18] word, but they cannot force you to
[58:21] accept and believe the
[58:24] word. It has to be a personal
[58:28] affair. You must accept the
[58:31] word. You must be selfdriven to believe
[58:34] the
[58:36] word. And when you believe the word,
[58:39] you're now a candidate to
[58:42] justification. For God so loved the
[58:44] world.
[58:46] have his only begotten
[58:48] son. Whoever
[58:50] believes, not whosoever
[58:54] heareth, who hear and
[58:57] believe, lives shall not
[59:01] die. You have been set
[59:05] aside. First over
[59:08] death. Now you get into the middle
[59:11] court. Still in the middle court.
[59:15] It has to be Jesus
[59:18] Christ. So when he died upon the cross,
[59:22] the Bible says when they came, the
[59:23] soldiers
[59:25] came and saw that he was
[59:28] dead. One of them got a
[59:32] spear. He got a
[59:35] spear and then he could not spear into
[59:38] his
[59:40] wounds. But he pierced him.
[59:44] And when he pierced
[59:45] him, praise the Lord, the Bible says two
[59:48] things came
[59:50] out. Blood and
[59:53] water. Praise the Lord. Water for for
[59:59] justification. When you believe and
[1:00:01] you're
[1:00:02] baptized, you shall be saved.
[1:00:06] So first you have
[1:00:08] believed Jesus Christ to be the son of
[1:00:11] God to be the one who can take out your
[1:00:15] sins. The one who can atone for your
[1:00:20] sins desire to live a righteous
[1:00:25] life tired of the burden of
[1:00:28] sin. Then you come and accept
[1:00:31] him. And then when you're
[1:00:34] baptized in water, praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] Bible says when you believe and you're
[1:00:40] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:00:44] you shall be saved.
[1:00:46] So you are saved. All your sins, past
[1:00:50] sins have been
[1:00:52] remitted. Praise the Lord. You get into
[1:00:57] him. Praise the Lord. his
[1:01:00] blood because after the after water
[1:01:03] there was
[1:01:05] blood. That blood is for
[1:01:09] cleansing the Old
[1:01:11] Testament. The blood that was offered
[1:01:14] that that was poured upon the
[1:01:16] altar. It came from God's and and sheep
[1:01:20] and
[1:01:22] cows. But now that blood did not have
[1:01:26] the power to cleanse the sins of
[1:01:30] men. It only covered
[1:01:32] them. But then that blood was a
[1:01:36] shadow of Jesus
[1:01:38] Christ that would come to cleanse our
[1:01:41] sins once and for all.
[1:01:45] Now when you get into the middle
[1:01:47] court, you are still in
[1:01:50] Christ and then he begins to cleanse
[1:01:53] you to make you
[1:01:56] holy. That's why the calls it the holy
[1:02:01] court in the holy place. Praise the
[1:02:04] Lord. So you've been called to live in
[1:02:07] the holy
[1:02:10] place, not in the church, but in a holy
[1:02:15] place. Jesus Christ. Praise God. Not in
[1:02:19] a church
[1:02:21] building. You have been called to live
[1:02:24] in
[1:02:25] Christ. Because if it were if it were a
[1:02:28] church
[1:02:30] building, any
[1:02:32] place, any church that has been built
[1:02:34] out
[1:02:35] there, regardless of whether it was
[1:02:38] built by
[1:02:39] who, it would be a good place for
[1:02:43] worship. But remember in the Old
[1:02:46] Testament, God said, "You shall not
[1:02:49] worship me.
[1:02:52] Every place that you
[1:02:54] see has to be one
[1:02:57] place and that place has to be Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ and Christ
[1:03:03] alone. Praise the Lord. So when you in
[1:03:05] the middle
[1:03:07] court, his blood is
[1:03:09] applying. Praise the Lord. The priest
[1:03:12] kept applying the
[1:03:14] blood. He kept pouring the
[1:03:16] blood. Even when the high priest entered
[1:03:21] to the holy of
[1:03:23] holies. The priests here in the middle
[1:03:26] court could not
[1:03:28] stop
[1:03:31] continuous. Praise the Lord of
[1:03:35] sanctification. It's a continuous
[1:03:37] process.
[1:03:39] The blood keeps on cleansing us every
[1:03:42] day of our
[1:03:44] lives to make us
[1:03:47] holy to make us without any
[1:03:51] blemish. The blood cleanses us of our
[1:03:55] sins. Praise the Lord. And now after
[1:03:59] there, the priest was in there. But now
[1:04:02] the Bible has told us that we have Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ.
[1:04:07] Well, in the Old
[1:04:09] Testament, in the shadows that were to
[1:04:13] come, and now you know that a
[1:04:16] shadow, praise the Lord, comes from
[1:04:21] something that there is an object
[1:04:24] somewhere. Praise the Lord. So that
[1:04:27] object is casting a shadow upon the
[1:04:32] ground. And as the person comes closer
[1:04:35] to the light,
[1:04:39] The shadow keeps
[1:04:42] disappearing. And when you you come and
[1:04:45] you're indirect in the
[1:04:49] light and you're all surrounded by
[1:04:53] light, there shall be no
[1:04:56] shadow because the shadow has been
[1:04:58] swallowed up by the reality of the
[1:05:00] object.
[1:05:04] So as long as the Christ had not yet
[1:05:07] come,
[1:05:10] praise the Lord, those feasts had to be
[1:05:12] carried
[1:05:15] out and the high priest had to enter
[1:05:17] into the holy of
[1:05:21] holies. But when the
[1:05:23] reality of the
[1:05:26] tabernacle, when the
[1:05:28] reality of the feasts came,
[1:05:32] The Bible says when Jesus Christ came,
[1:05:37] he became the high priest
[1:05:41] himself so he could stand at the
[1:05:43] door to call out the
[1:05:46] people. Then he could move the
[1:05:49] people into the middle court. So it is
[1:05:53] Christ into the
[1:05:55] minister. It is Christy to the
[1:05:58] pastor ministering praise to the
[1:06:04] people. It has to be
[1:06:06] Christ ministering sanctification to the
[1:06:10] people. Praise the Lord because we are
[1:06:14] sanctified also by the
[1:06:16] word. Praise the Lord. the word Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ and there is no you can be
[1:06:25] sanctified without the word because it
[1:06:28] is in the
[1:06:29] word that you will know that you need to
[1:06:33] live
[1:06:35] right is the word that pes our
[1:06:39] conscience is the word that prunes
[1:06:43] us praise the Lord what is the word
[1:06:47] Jesus Christ is the word.
[1:06:50] Praise the Lord. It is him that
[1:06:54] justifies and it is him that
[1:06:57] sanctifies. He became the high
[1:07:00] priest. Praise the Lord. He entered from
[1:07:04] the middle
[1:07:06] court. He entered into the innermost
[1:07:09] court.
[1:07:11] But then the work the ministration in
[1:07:14] the middle
[1:07:16] court still continues to go
[1:07:20] on. Praise the Lord. Now when he entered
[1:07:23] in
[1:07:23] there, the Bible says he entered in
[1:07:27] there
[1:07:28] once and for
[1:07:32] all. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:35] became the
[1:07:37] manifestation of the life that was in
[1:07:40] the innermost court.
[1:07:44] The innermost
[1:07:48] court, the sha glory that was in there
[1:07:53] was a shadow of the glory of Christ
[1:07:56] himself.
[1:07:58] when he came in
[1:08:00] there. We don't need a high priest to go
[1:08:03] there for
[1:08:06] us. We need Jesus Christ himself.
[1:08:11] Praise the Lord. And now when he entered
[1:08:14] there, praise the Lord. The veil that
[1:08:17] was in the middle
[1:08:18] court, the
[1:08:21] veil was separating the middle
[1:08:25] court from the innermost
[1:08:28] court. It was cut into
[1:08:31] two
[1:08:33] praise. It had not be the high priest
[1:08:36] alone to enter
[1:08:38] there. to open the door for all of us to
[1:08:41] enter in
[1:08:44] there. In the Old Testament, it had been
[1:08:48] reserved only for the high
[1:08:50] priest. Only him came and he died with
[1:08:55] God. Only him came and worshiped God
[1:09:00] there. Only him he came and had
[1:09:03] fellowship with God
[1:09:05] there. When the reality of the high
[1:09:08] priesthood
[1:09:11] came, the shadow was cast
[1:09:15] away. Then he when he cut the
[1:09:18] veil, we all have access to
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:24] him. Praise the Lord, we all have access
[1:09:27] to
[1:09:29] him. And the prophet says in the message
[1:09:33] Revelation 4,
[1:09:38] 1961. He says it's got three
[1:09:41] gates. It's got three
[1:09:45] gates. What are we doing? We are
[1:09:48] breaking
[1:09:49] down and says don't miss
[1:09:52] it. Coming from the
[1:09:55] flesh, the five
[1:09:58] senses to the
[1:10:01] next, the saw and the inner courts.
[1:10:06] But now you come into the
[1:10:09] heart. There is where you got pilgrim
[1:10:12] holiness and method stayed on the on
[1:10:14] that altar out
[1:10:17] there. You are in the
[1:10:22] courts. You are in the
[1:10:25] courts. You rather and so
[1:10:28] forth back in the
[1:10:31] flesh back there with the five senses.
[1:10:35] The eye can
[1:10:37] see and make out
[1:10:41] because the people could see the outer
[1:10:43] court and they could still see the
[1:10:46] middle
[1:10:47] court. There is only one court that they
[1:10:50] could not
[1:10:52] see. That is the there was only one
[1:10:55] place they could not
[1:10:56] see. It was the holy of
[1:10:59] holies. Praise the Lord. And now he has
[1:11:03] said
[1:11:04] here the three
[1:11:06] gates. So he has talked about the the
[1:11:09] first two which are
[1:11:13] physical and we can see them but in the
[1:11:17] me in the innermost
[1:11:20] court is a secret
[1:11:23] place. And what is that? Praise the
[1:11:26] Lord. And he says, "Then how do we get
[1:11:31] into this?"
[1:11:33] Remember, there was a
[1:11:35] veil, a veil that hangs between the holy
[1:11:38] and the holiest of
[1:11:41] holies. In the holiest of
[1:11:44] holies is where Christ comes to sit down
[1:11:46] on your heart's
[1:11:50] throne. Christ is enthroned.
[1:11:55] He comes through
[1:11:58] justification right
[1:12:00] sanctification and then by one
[1:12:06] water by one
[1:12:10] church by one
[1:12:12] creed by one
[1:12:15] spirit. From here we are all baptized in
[1:12:18] one into one body.
[1:12:24] which is the body of
[1:12:26] Christ. By
[1:12:28] what? By the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:32] Praise the Lord. We try to demonstrate
[1:12:34] here how we enter in
[1:12:37] there. And I want to say this that
[1:12:41] Christ is God's place of
[1:12:47] worship is the only place that God has
[1:12:52] provided for
[1:12:54] worship. Praise the Lord not in any
[1:12:58] denomination. Denominations try to
[1:13:00] create a place of
[1:13:04] worship. We have all been failing.
[1:13:08] And the only thing that can stand
[1:13:11] out is the thing that God has provided
[1:13:15] for. He gave us shadows in the Old
[1:13:19] Testament. God never gave anything and
[1:13:22] never came to
[1:13:24] pass. So now he provided a
[1:13:27] place. He said only in one
[1:13:31] place. Will you worship
[1:13:33] me? Not in a
[1:13:35] church. not in a
[1:13:38] denomination, not in any religious
[1:13:41] gathering. That's why it says you shall
[1:13:44] not go in any place that you
[1:13:48] see. Praise the Lord. Now we see that in
[1:13:51] the Old
[1:13:53] Testament. The only people that
[1:13:56] tried to force a common
[1:14:00] place according to their
[1:14:04] desire was
[1:14:06] Nimrod. When he forced the people to
[1:14:09] come
[1:14:10] together to build a
[1:14:13] town which was against the will of
[1:14:19] God. So while God provided one way to
[1:14:22] worship him,
[1:14:27] While God provided one way to worship
[1:14:31] him in the Old
[1:14:33] Testament, there was also a
[1:14:36] spirit that was creating an
[1:14:41] alternative to bring the people
[1:14:44] together. But
[1:14:47] God, he is a jealousy
[1:14:50] God. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:52] does not allow
[1:14:55] competition. That's why the Bible says
[1:14:58] you cannot dine on the table of
[1:15:02] mammons and also dine on the table of
[1:15:05] Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ. You have to choose
[1:15:08] one whom you shall serve and
[1:15:12] worship. Praise the Lord. So when tried
[1:15:15] to build a
[1:15:18] tower, it had to be
[1:15:22] destroyed. And the spirit of
[1:15:25] Nimrod is living in the world
[1:15:29] today. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:34] move that brings the people from all
[1:15:37] walks of life
[1:15:40] together and are trying to build a
[1:15:43] modernday
[1:15:47] babel. Praise the Lord, creating their
[1:15:50] own place of worship.
[1:15:54] pointing the people to
[1:15:57] themselves to manmade creeds and
[1:16:01] dogmas to teachings of the
[1:16:05] world instead of pointing them to Jesus
[1:16:09] Christ and the Bible calls them the
[1:16:12] spirit of
[1:16:15] antichrist. It is he who works against
[1:16:19] the word of
[1:16:21] God who is contrary to the teaching of
[1:16:24] the
[1:16:26] word who does not point the people Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ but points them to something
[1:16:34] else spirit that
[1:16:37] teaches that there are three
[1:16:40] gods and yet the Bible
[1:16:42] says there is only one God.
[1:16:46] And in the Old Testament when God was
[1:16:49] giving the law to
[1:16:51] Moses in the Ten
[1:16:54] Commandments, it says the Lord is one
[1:16:58] Lord and he shall serve only one
[1:17:03] God. And now what is the name of that
[1:17:07] God? Praise the Lord. Because in the Old
[1:17:10] Testament those are shadows.
[1:17:13] Now when we come the New
[1:17:16] Testament, Jesus comes even before he
[1:17:19] comes. Praise the Lord. God spoke about
[1:17:23] him in the Old
[1:17:25] Testament. He spoke to the
[1:17:28] prophets. He spoke to
[1:17:30] Isaiah's. Praise the Lord. He says, "A
[1:17:35] son shall be
[1:17:37] born. A son shall be
[1:17:39] given. His name shall
[1:17:42] be
[1:17:45] wonderful, prince of
[1:17:47] peace, mighty
[1:17:50] God, and all the
[1:17:54] governments shall be upon his
[1:17:57] shoulder. And now we see in the book of
[1:18:01] Matthew, God sent the angel
[1:18:05] Gabriel to bring the message.
[1:18:08] He says a son shall be
[1:18:12] born and his name shall be called
[1:18:15] Jesus. He was telling uh when he was
[1:18:17] telling
[1:18:19] Mary name shall be given to the
[1:18:22] son and his name shall be called
[1:18:25] Jesus. Praise the Lord. Because the
[1:18:28] angel had
[1:18:30] proclaimed that this son that was to be
[1:18:34] born called
[1:18:36] Emmanuel was to be
[1:18:39] interpreted God with
[1:18:42] us. In other words, the same son that
[1:18:45] was provided for in the book of
[1:18:49] Isaiah that would come into the
[1:18:53] world would be called a mighty God.
[1:18:57] He was now
[1:18:59] born by
[1:19:01] Mary after the pattern of the word of
[1:19:06] God. Born by man and
[1:19:10] woman was born after the
[1:19:13] pattern of the spoken word. And that
[1:19:18] son the Bible referred
[1:19:21] to as the mighty God, the prince of
[1:19:25] peace, the everlasting
[1:19:27] God and all the
[1:19:30] governments, all
[1:19:33] authority and be upon his
[1:19:36] shoulders. And when Jesus came, praise
[1:19:39] the Lord, and they asked him, who art
[1:19:42] thou? He would stand and say, "I am who
[1:19:47] I
[1:19:48] am." And when God had visited
[1:19:51] Moses in the burning
[1:19:54] bush to him, who art thou? And God says,
[1:20:00] "I am who I am, the God of the Old
[1:20:04] Testament, being the God in the New
[1:20:08] Testament." His name was Jesus Christ.
[1:20:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:13] And another
[1:20:14] place he would stand and
[1:20:17] say, "I and my
[1:20:19] father are one, no man has seen the
[1:20:24] father except he has seen
[1:20:26] me." Praise the Lord. Now in the book of
[1:20:30] Colossians, the Bible still says,
[1:20:34] Colossians chapter 2 around verse 9 to
[1:20:38] 10. It says the
[1:20:41] fullness, the
[1:20:43] fullness of the
[1:20:46] godhead is in Christ Jesus
[1:20:49] bodily. Praise the Lord. I feel Timothy
[1:20:52] would stand to
[1:20:53] say
[1:20:55] God was sin of angels.
[1:20:59] his
[1:21:00] throne coming
[1:21:02] down for what? To redeem man back to
[1:21:07] himself. Praise the Lord. Stand at the
[1:21:11] door and call the people to
[1:21:14] himself. Whoever wills, let him
[1:21:17] come. And now when he comes, he would
[1:21:21] open the door. And when he opened the
[1:21:23] door of his
[1:21:24] heart, Christ enters in.
[1:21:28] Praise the Lord. Christ would still say
[1:21:31] I and my
[1:21:33] father are one.
[1:21:36] Praise the Lord. You will still say I am
[1:21:38] alpha and
[1:21:41] omega. In the book of
[1:21:43] revelation when he was given the
[1:21:46] revelation to John, praise the Lord, I
[1:21:51] am alpha and
[1:21:53] omega, the beginning and the end.
[1:21:58] So if he would be the alpha and
[1:22:00] omega, if before him there was none.
[1:22:05] Praise the Lord. Before him there was
[1:22:09] none and after him there is
[1:22:13] none. So he's fulfilling the
[1:22:16] prophecy that Isaiah spoke
[1:22:18] about that he would be the everlasting
[1:22:22] God. That is the person Jesus
[1:22:25] Christ. Praise the Lord. All the shadows
[1:22:28] in the Old
[1:22:30] Testament talking about him, they were
[1:22:33] all titles.
[1:22:36] Praise the Lord. You would say, "I am
[1:22:38] who I am." But that's not a name. Praise
[1:22:42] the Lord. Now, there were seven, seven
[1:22:45] redemptive
[1:22:46] names.
[1:22:48] Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah
[1:22:53] Shoval of them. All of them were simply
[1:22:58] titles. But when the name was
[1:23:02] given, when the name was
[1:23:04] given to
[1:23:07] Mary, you shall call his name
[1:23:12] Jesus. Praise the Lord. And now it is by
[1:23:15] his blood
[1:23:18] that all our sins are
[1:23:21] remitted. Praise the Lord. It must be
[1:23:24] through Jesus
[1:23:25] Christ that we are able to enter into
[1:23:28] the holy of
[1:23:30] holies because
[1:23:32] himself. He did not only become the high
[1:23:36] priest, but he is at the same time the
[1:23:38] holy of
[1:23:40] holies. Praise the Lord. He who shines
[1:23:43] the sha glory upon us.
[1:23:48] with source of
[1:23:49] life. That's why he says come unto
[1:23:53] me give of
[1:23:55] you water and when you take of this
[1:23:59] water you shall never
[1:24:03] thirst
[1:24:05] water gives everlasting
[1:24:08] life. Praise the Lord. Christ
[1:24:11] Jesus who is the everlasting
[1:24:15] life and if it's Christ
[1:24:17] Jesus who is everlasting life I won't
[1:24:21] say that God will only meet
[1:24:25] us in Jesus Christ. Praise the Lord any
[1:24:30] other place in Jesus Christ. Praise the
[1:24:34] Lord. all the shadows in the Old
[1:24:38] Testament pointing us to Jesus
[1:24:41] Christ. And when God said, "You shall
[1:24:45] not choose any
[1:24:46] place," he
[1:24:48] meant that he only provided one
[1:24:52] way and it had to be through Jesus
[1:24:55] Christ. Praise the Lord. And the prophet
[1:24:59] continues to
[1:25:00] say in another
[1:25:02] message he says he
[1:25:06] decided how he would save
[1:25:10] man. We've tried today to educate man
[1:25:12] into
[1:25:15] it. We've tried to school
[1:25:18] them. Try to
[1:25:22] denominate. Try to do all these other
[1:25:25] kind of things.
[1:25:27] Bring them in. Shake them in. Baptize
[1:25:30] them
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:32] in. Every other way there
[1:25:34] is. Bring them in by
[1:25:37] letters, but still remains the
[1:25:41] same. God meets man under the shed blood
[1:25:44] of the
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:48] lamb. Blood was God's way in the
[1:25:52] beginning. was God is in the beginning.
[1:25:58] My blood is God's way
[1:26:03] tonight. Praise the Lord. He say it's
[1:26:05] good to do the penance of all these
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:16] things. way that God chose to save
[1:26:20] man and he could
[1:26:23] not. He chose that blood had to be in
[1:26:26] the middle
[1:26:28] court and he could not change
[1:26:31] it. High priest could not enter
[1:26:34] there without sacrifices being made in
[1:26:37] the middle
[1:26:39] court and there is no way we could
[1:26:42] receive eternal
[1:26:44] life. No way we could meet God in the
[1:26:47] Holy of
[1:26:49] Holies without the shed blood of Jesus
[1:26:52] Christ.
[1:26:54] Praise the Lord. I say just like the
[1:26:58] moon is a shadow of the
[1:27:02] sun. Praise the Lord. Strong with the
[1:27:05] projection, brother.
[1:27:08] So just like the moon is a shadow of the
[1:27:12] sun, it serves in the absence of the
[1:27:15] sun.
[1:27:18] Just like the church is to serve in the
[1:27:20] absence of the son of
[1:27:24] God. Praise the Lord. Two things. We
[1:27:28] have the moon and the
[1:27:29] sun. And the moon only gives us
[1:27:33] light that it receives from the
[1:27:38] sun. So without the sun, the moon cannot
[1:27:42] give us
[1:27:43] light. Praise the Lord. Now when the sun
[1:27:48] comes in the
[1:27:50] morning, we don't need the light from
[1:27:52] the
[1:27:55] moon because the reality of the light is
[1:27:59] come.
[1:28:01] And he continues to say in the absence
[1:28:04] of the
[1:28:06] sun, the
[1:28:08] church the letter. So the
[1:28:12] believers serve God and and give light
[1:28:15] in the absence of the
[1:28:21] sun. And then this what he says about
[1:28:23] the sun and the moon. When the sun
[1:28:27] rises, you don't see the moon no
[1:28:30] more because it is gone
[1:28:34] down. It doesn't need its light
[1:28:39] anymore. Just like husband and
[1:28:42] wife, sun and
[1:28:44] moon, church and Christ.
[1:28:47] We find that this
[1:28:49] thing being a shadow of
[1:28:52] Christ, every
[1:28:55] sacrifice, every feast and everything in
[1:28:58] the Old
[1:29:00] Testament shadowed
[1:29:03] Christ just as the shadow strikes across
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:10] floor. Now, here is where we are going
[1:29:13] to have to find the correct place of
[1:29:15] worship.
[1:29:17] Let's go back here in the Old
[1:29:20] Testament where it was
[1:29:23] given. Now when a shadow comes across
[1:29:27] the
[1:29:29] floor, you can tell whether it is
[1:29:33] man or a
[1:29:36] beast might
[1:29:38] be because it casts a shadow upon the
[1:29:42] floor. And as the shadow gets
[1:29:47] shorter, the shadow being the negative.
[1:29:56] You know in the old in the old we used
[1:29:58] when people took
[1:30:00] pictures. There was always that small
[1:30:02] piece we called a
[1:30:05] negative. But that negative was not the
[1:30:07] real
[1:30:09] picture. It only contained the light of
[1:30:12] the picture.
[1:30:15] And so he says, "And as the shadow gets
[1:30:19] shorter, the shadow being the
[1:30:23] negative cannot be a negative without a
[1:30:29] positive. When the positive becomes
[1:30:31] closer to the
[1:30:34] negative, the negative is sold up in the
[1:30:37] positive.
[1:30:39] That is the principle of physics.
[1:30:42] They cancel each other's effect.
[1:30:45] They cancel each other's effect.
[1:30:48] So the negative, the negative ceases to
[1:30:50] be.
[1:30:53] So the
[1:30:54] shadow, the positive comes
[1:30:58] together and that's what makes it then
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:02] positive. And if all the old things,
[1:31:08] the Bible said, the Old Testament was
[1:31:10] shadow of the things to
[1:31:15] come. Then therefore, Christ was the
[1:31:17] shadow of things to
[1:31:22] come. The Old Testament
[1:31:25] types where he chose to put his
[1:31:30] name as the shadow is.
[1:31:34] crosses the
[1:31:36] floor. I said is a negative being a
[1:31:40] type. So we the worshippers
[1:31:44] also can see the shadows of the Old
[1:31:45] Testament fading into the positive of
[1:31:48] the
[1:31:53] new. Now paragraph
[1:31:56] 41 of the message God is place of
[1:32:01] worship says now and he that is in his
[1:32:09] name he what is his
[1:32:12] name first we'll have to find what God's
[1:32:16] name
[1:32:18] is before we can find what is his
[1:32:22] putting
[1:32:26] place. We find out that he had many
[1:32:30] titles.
[1:32:32] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, those are all
[1:32:37] titles. Rose of
[1:32:40] Shon, Rose of Sharon,
[1:32:43] which is a title, and the rest of them,
[1:32:47] but he has a
[1:32:49] name. when he met
[1:32:52] Moses, he had not a name
[1:32:54] yet. So he told Moses, "I am that I
[1:32:58] am." And the prophet makes a statement
[1:33:02] and says Jesus in the book of in the
[1:33:04] book of Hebrews rather in the book of
[1:33:07] St. John chapter
[1:33:11] 6. He also says, "I am that I
[1:33:15] am." Praise the Lord. And now he said
[1:33:18] before Abraham was I am.
[1:33:22] I am was the
[1:33:24] one in the burning bush, the pillar of
[1:33:28] fire that was in the burning bush back
[1:33:30] in the days of
[1:33:33] Moses. And now Proverb 44, it
[1:33:36] says we find out that Jesus
[1:33:40] also says, "I came in the father's
[1:33:44] name." Praise the Lord. down there. It
[1:33:48] says, "And Gabriel called him
[1:33:52] Jesus. The prophet called prophets
[1:33:55] called him Jesus.
[1:33:57] And he was absolutely
[1:33:59] Jesus before his birth. Even the whole
[1:34:03] prophet called his name
[1:34:08] Emmanuel. Then God was manifested in the
[1:34:12] flesh in order take away the sin of the
[1:34:15] world.
[1:34:17] And in doing so, he was given the name
[1:34:20] of
[1:34:21] Jesus. So Jesus is the
[1:34:24] name. And the name was placed in a
[1:34:28] man, not a church, not a
[1:34:32] denomination, not a creed, but a
[1:34:36] man. He chose to place his name in Jesus
[1:34:40] Christ.
[1:34:42] Now we find out that that then he
[1:34:46] becomes the place of God's
[1:34:50] worship where you worship
[1:34:53] him even before he was even
[1:34:56] born. His name was called
[1:34:58] Jesus. It was so
[1:35:01] important. It was given to his mother by
[1:35:04] the angel
[1:35:07] Gabriel that his name would be called
[1:35:09] Jesus.
[1:35:13] That's who he
[1:35:15] was. There we have
[1:35:17] it. This is it
[1:35:20] alone. It is him
[1:35:23] alone. God is chosen place of
[1:35:27] worship. God is
[1:35:29] place. God chose to meet
[1:35:33] man. So
[1:35:35] worship. Where did God choose to meet
[1:35:38] man?
[1:35:40] God God chose to meet man in Jesus
[1:35:45] Christ. Not in the church, not in a
[1:35:49] denomination, not in a creed, but in
[1:35:53] Christ. That's why. That's the only
[1:35:56] place that God will meet man
[1:36:01] again. We can worship God in Christ.
[1:36:06] No matter if you're a
[1:36:07] Methodist, if you're a Baptist, if
[1:36:10] you're a Catholic, if you're
[1:36:13] Protestant, whatever you may be, there's
[1:36:16] only one place that you can correctly
[1:36:19] worship
[1:36:21] God. That is in Christ
[1:36:24] Jesus. And where is Christ Jesus?
[1:36:28] He resides in the most sacred
[1:36:32] place is in the word of
[1:36:36] God. It is the word of God
[1:36:39] himself. And where does the word of God
[1:36:43] reside? God chose one place in
[1:36:47] us where he would place his
[1:36:50] word. Praise the Lord. It is not in our
[1:36:53] body.
[1:36:55] God chose the
[1:36:58] soul because the soul is the most sacred
[1:37:01] place of man.
[1:37:04] Praise the Lord. The soul feeds on the
[1:37:07] word of
[1:37:09] God. The soul feeds on the sha
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:15] glory feeds on the light of
[1:37:19] God. Praise the Lord. So where is God
[1:37:22] blessed?
[1:37:24] The life of a man. Praise the Lord. Like
[1:37:28] we saw some time
[1:37:30] ago as a prophet speaks about
[1:37:34] it that a man comprises of
[1:37:37] three. Praise the Lord. He has the body.
[1:37:41] He has the the
[1:37:44] spirit or the heart and then he has the
[1:37:49] soul. Praise the Lord. That is the
[1:37:52] temple.
[1:37:53] know ye not that you are the temple of
[1:37:57] the living
[1:37:58] God. So if you're the temple of the
[1:38:00] living
[1:38:02] God does God reside in his
[1:38:05] body. This body is
[1:38:08] corrupt. It fails every day. So God
[1:38:12] cannot dwell in the
[1:38:14] body. So where does God dwell in
[1:38:17] us? Praise the Lord. The heart, the
[1:38:21] heart where your thoughts
[1:38:23] are. Are your thoughts
[1:38:25] clean? Your thoughts can be
[1:38:29] defiled. Cannot be
[1:38:31] defiled. Praise the Lord. Where does God
[1:38:34] dwell in us? Where does he
[1:38:37] live? The most sacred point of our
[1:38:42] lives is in our
[1:38:44] soul. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:47] It is out of the soul that God redeems
[1:38:52] man. Because when he dwells in
[1:38:55] there, he begins to work from inside
[1:38:58] out. He conquers the
[1:39:01] soul. After conquering the soul at the
[1:39:04] battle of the Holy
[1:39:06] Spirit, he begins to work from inside
[1:39:09] out conquers the
[1:39:12] spirit. So he takes over your
[1:39:14] imagination.
[1:39:16] You begin to have the mind of
[1:39:18] God. Let this mind be in you. So you
[1:39:22] begin to have the mind of
[1:39:23] Christ. Your imaginations
[1:39:26] change. Begin to think about the things
[1:39:29] of
[1:39:30] God. Praise the Lord. Now after he has
[1:39:33] conquered the
[1:39:34] mind, he projects to the
[1:39:37] body. Then he begins to rule over your
[1:39:40] body. Because your mind controls your
[1:39:44] body. what your mind
[1:39:46] thinks. Nobody will go to do. If God
[1:39:50] takes over your
[1:39:52] mind, he has control over your
[1:39:55] body. Praise the Lord. All these
[1:39:59] things, we all type the holiness of
[1:40:03] God. Praise the Lord. God has pointed
[1:40:07] us. Nothing
[1:40:09] else but to
[1:40:11] Jesus. He is the truth.
[1:40:15] He is the
[1:40:16] way. He is
[1:40:18] life. Without him there is no life.
[1:40:23] Without him you cannot worship God.
[1:40:26] There is only one
[1:40:28] way. Man can worship
[1:40:31] God. God put only one way. But we can
[1:40:35] worship him. In the Old Testament, he
[1:40:38] gave them only one place. And in the New
[1:40:41] Testament, he has also given us one
[1:40:45] place that is in Jesus
[1:40:48] Christ, our point of
[1:40:52] refuge. And in him, you are safe and
[1:40:56] free from all
[1:40:59] sin. You have eternal
[1:41:02] life. In him, you are safe from all
[1:41:05] harm.
[1:41:08] In him we have
[1:41:12] protection we have our everlasting
[1:41:17] portion we have eternal
[1:41:21] life. Where can we
[1:41:23] go? Praise the Lord. Only in Jesus
[1:41:27] Christ. God has given us one place to
[1:41:31] worship him and that is in Jesus Christ.
[1:41:37] Will you choose him today?
[1:41:40] Amen. We shall choose to worship in
[1:41:43] Christ
[1:41:45] alone. Not in the power of man, not in
[1:41:49] what man
[1:41:52] says, but in what Christ
[1:41:55] says. Because that's the only
[1:41:58] place that God has chosen for
[1:42:01] man to worship him, to meet him, to have
[1:42:06] fellowship with him, to speak to him, to
[1:42:10] get forgiveness of
[1:42:12] sins, and to get eternal
[1:42:15] life. May God bless
[1:42:23] you. Amen.
[1:42:27] And uh there is that song that we just
[1:42:29] sang, redeemed. How I love to proclaim
[1:42:32] him.
[1:42:36] Redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the
[1:42:38] blood of the lamb.
[1:42:43] I wonder if it's song 140. Yes, 140.
[1:42:46] Let's get up on our feet. We sing that
[1:42:49] first verse, the chorus, then we shall
[1:42:53] pray. Amen.
[1:42:56] Amen. Redeemed, how I love to
[1:43:01] proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:08] lamb. Redeemed through
[1:43:11] his
[1:43:14] mercy. His shine
[1:43:17] forever. I am redeemed.
[1:43:22] Oh
[1:43:24] redeemed. I'm
[1:43:27] redeemed by the blood. Oh I am
[1:43:32] redeemed.
[1:43:36] Redeemed
[1:43:39] redeemed. His shout that forever I am.
[1:43:46] So redeemed and so happy in no language
[1:43:51] my rapture can
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] tell. I know that the light of his
[1:44:01] presence. With me he go and
[1:44:04] dwell. Oh with
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:09] me I'm redeemed.
[1:44:13] I'm
[1:44:15] redeemed. I'm
[1:44:18] redeemed. By the
[1:44:21] blood are you
[1:44:25] redeemed. Oh
[1:44:27] redeemed bread. I've
[1:44:30] redeemed his child forever. I am. I
[1:44:36] think of my blessed redeemer. I
[1:44:39] sing. I sing of him all day long.
[1:44:44] Oh, I sing I can't be silent. I have
[1:44:48] sing about him every time. Oh, I sing I
[1:44:53] cannot
[1:44:55] miss. Oh, his love
[1:45:00] star. Are you
[1:45:04] redeemed? Oh, redeemed.
[1:45:09] I'm
[1:45:11] redeemed. By the blood
[1:45:14] of you
[1:45:16] redeem
[1:45:18] redeemed.
[1:45:20] Oh
[1:45:25] redeem
[1:45:26] forever. I know I shall see his beauty.
[1:45:30] I know I shall see his. The king in
[1:45:36] whose law I lies.
[1:45:38] In his word I
[1:45:40] delight who lovingly guidestth my
[1:45:44] footsteps. Oh and then he gives me songs
[1:45:49] in the night and give.
[1:45:53] Oh are you
[1:45:57] redeemed? I'm redeemed.
[1:46:01] Are you redeemed? Red by the blood of
[1:46:07] Are you
[1:46:10] redeemed? Oh,
[1:46:13] redeemed. Oh, yes. Redeem is sh. Oh,
[1:46:19] let's sing that last verse. I know I
[1:46:22] shall see his beauty. I know shall see
[1:46:27] in his in his beauty the king in whose
[1:46:32] law I delight who lovingly guarded my
[1:46:37] footsteps who he guarded. He guard him
[1:46:41] from all
[1:46:43] enemies and giveth me so I am redeemed.
[1:46:52] Oh
[1:46:53] redeemed. Are you
[1:46:56] redeemed? We are all redeemed by the
[1:46:58] blood of the lamb. Oh, we thank God. I'm
[1:47:04] redeemed. Oh,
[1:47:06] redeemed. Oh, we are all
[1:47:09] redeemed.
[1:47:11] Oh, oh, we can all worship the Lord
[1:47:14] tonight. We thank you, precious father,
[1:47:16] for the grace, oh God. You've given us
[1:47:18] the grace. You've given us the blood of

[1:47:27] acceptable to drive us into the holy of
[1:47:30] holies that we can have fellowship with
[1:47:33] you there. We can worship you there, oh
