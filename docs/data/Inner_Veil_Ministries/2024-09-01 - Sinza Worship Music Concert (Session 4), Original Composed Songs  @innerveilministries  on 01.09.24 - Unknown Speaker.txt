bring them in from the FSS of s bring bring bring down wondering ones to [Music] J praise the name of our Lord when you got the denominations they always get the little children like these ones and then they pour water on their foreheads saying that they baptizing them but that is wrong there is no basis in the Bible where they ever baptized a little child it is not written because the Bible says one has to First believe then confess then he baptized but this little baby doesn't understand understand anything and you can't even preach the gospel to the baby so it is wrong baptism which they do in the denominations so when the little children are brought to Christ in Matthew chapter 19 and then verse 13 the Bible says then we are brought unto him little children that he' put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked [Music] them but Jesus said suffer the little children for them not to come unto me for such is the kingdom of God and he laid his hands on them and

bless this little child we pray that the blessings of God be upon her life you may watch over this baby father you protect this baby from all part [Music] [Music] [Applause] physically and spiritually that you may give them they may be a positive influence to her in the things concerning God we pray may give them the ability to provide for all the needs of this baby and likewise we pray for this baby Lord that your garden angel May over watch over her all her lifetime here on Earth and even at the time of accountability we pray that she may come to the altar believing the Lord Jesus Christ and confessing Christ as our personal s we pray your grace be upon this child and all that You' purposed for this child may it come to pass in her life bless the family and watch and protect them Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus ask this amen amen bless God bless [Music] you then again there is another announcement here this is a wedding invitation the family of Fabiano and Victoria together with Mr and Mrs of Ginger district and invites inil Church to the wedding ceremony of their children and Juliet which is going to take place at inil church that's here at the church it will be on 14th of

wedding will be conducted here so you are all invited praise the name of our Lord so God bless you amen so I think let us stand up our Bibles we go to the Book of Psalms Psalms 96 we're reading from verse 1 to verse 13 the Bible says Sing unto the Lord a new song sing unto the Lord all the Earth SE Now sing unto the Lord bless his name show forth his salvation from from day to day declare his glory among the Heathen his wonders among all the people for the Lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the nations are Idols but the Lord made the heavens honor and Majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary give unto the Lord all you kindreds of the people give unto the Lord glory and strength give unto the Lord the glory due to his name bring an offering and come into his court oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth say among the Heen that the Lord reth the world also shall be established that Shall Not Be Moved he shall judge the people righteously and the people with and the people with his is to be feared in the water and then you draw praise the name of our Lord and you know the waves maybe we are moving vertically you know but just on the sides the power of God keeping the water there like the water that is kept in a glass praise the name of our Lord like in some of these countries they have kind of like underground restaurants you know just beneath the sea and then you can be there below the sea and then you see the fish swimming around but then this people are walking praise the name of our Lord and then now when they were moving then the army of Egypt they are also following them but they were not part of that Redemption praise the name of our Lord they kept on following until the little ones praise the name of our Lord and you know they had little ones they had you know they had those who were not strong but then they were foll until the last ones however weak they were of the children of Israel cross the Red Sea praise the name of our Lord and then we have a song that says the blood of Jesus Christ shall never lose its power until the last one until the weakest one is a to see no more praise the name of our Lord you may be the weakest in this med but I'm telling you there is the power of God to make you completely be transformed praise the name of the Lord the Red Sea could not close until the weakest of the children of Israel crossed praise the name of our Lord even the same thing the blood of Jesus Christ Christ can never leave the mer SE until the last one until the weakest one praise the name of our Lord is redeemed to sin no more that is the grace that God has given us so now when they all cross and then God told Moses let the water be restored and then the water was restored then the army of pharaoh however Mighty they were in the things of the world however skill the wind the things of the world they were all destroyed praise the name of our Lord and then now that became a song it became a new song a song of redemption let us go to exter 15 praise the name of our Lord Exodus chapter 15 and then we can read from verse one okay we can start from Exodus chapter 14 and then verse verse 26 the Bible says and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters May Come Again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon their h and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea [Music] and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them they remained not so much as one of them praise the name of the Lord you know the Egyptians had had the children of Israel for more than 400 years and now at the time of redemption of the children of Israel that's when the Egyptians started to punish them praise the name of our Lord and there are also some strations in our lives that can hold you some habits that can bind you you've tried to get rid of that habit but whever you got the Habit follows you you go there it follows you you go there it follows you everything to overcome that Happ but the thing you need to do is don't give up following the Lord praise the name of our Lord these Egyptians they didn't want to let go of the children of Isel even when they had lost their first borns in their houses they still got stuck we need to bring them back and you know there are some circumstances in life where the devil wants to keep you his slave where the devil wants you to be his own forever praise the name of our Lord don't allow that even if he pulling you back keep on going forward praise the name of our Lord even if the STS are hard keep on pressing forward and that's what the children of Israel had they had Moses leading them with the word of God let us keep on going let us keep on going it didn't matter what enemy was doing to follow them praise the name of our Lord but it reached a time that the enemy had to be cut off even there will come a time in your life that whatever enemies in your life has to be cut off praise the name of our Lord so you just keep on moving forward without giving up whatever St is traveling you you don't give up praise the name of our Lord but keep on holding strong to the word of God so it reached a time that the children of the Egyptians had to be destroyed praise the name of our Lord and when the Egyptians were destroyed praise the name of the Lord there was joy in the children of Israel they sng a new song a song of Deliverance a song of Deliverance song that we have been made free praise the name of the Lord physically they were set free physically going to the promised land praise the name of our Lord they were losen then in Exodus let us continue vers 29 but the children of Israel walked on the dry land in the midst of the Sea and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand and on the left thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore praise the name of our Lord they just saw these enemies are now dead praise the name of our Lord where you see what has been bothering you is no more what has been binding you is no more the sickness that has been torturing you is no more there is such a time and when that time comes you sing a new song Praise the name of our Lord you sing a new song to the Lord a song of Praise a song of worship a song of Adoration of the great things that the Lord has done praise the name of our Lord you sing a new song Maybe youve been praying for something and you have taken too long to get that thing come back now when it comes then the inspiration strikes you and then you sing a new song Praise the name of you talk about people have been looking for Life Partners praise the name of the Lord and then now when they see the thing is now over praise the name of our Lord I'm just remembering brother Dan in praise the name of our Lord just a new song then Joshua the introduction in praise the name of our Lord you know and then they get a new song it's such an excitement and some want to reveal that song on that day praise the name of our Lord like the song the Bible says what a happy day when Jesus saved my soul praise the name of our Lord it was a happy day what a glorious day when I knew Christ what a great day when I knew who I am praise the name of our Lord then you sing a new song a song to praise the lord of the things that he has done of the great things he has worked in your life praise the name of Lord and then the Bible says and Israel saw the great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians verse 31 and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant Moses then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song and to the Lord and spoke saying I will sing unto the Lord he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his Riders thrown into the sea praise the name of the Lord so now you see that the experience that they went through became a song Praise the name of our Lord a song of testimony the writer and the horse they have been thrown praise the name of the Lord a song of John giving a testimony of What the Lord Has Done in your life and so these songs also should be able to bring a power of transformation in your life praise the name of the Lord maybe when you are distress and then you hear one of these songs it must have that kind of anointing that can come and release you from any kind of bondage praise the name of our Lord when Prophet elishah was troubled and then there are three kings that had come to inquire from him then the prophet told them can you get me somebody with music and then a person with music came and then he started singing Praise the name of then the spirit of God Came Upon the prophet and that's why when we come to church let us not time to come when the preacher is going to start come and those traveling Spirits can get away through our song Services you come and yield yourself when they say let us raise our hands you also raise your hands when they say let us stand you also stand when they say let us clap our hands you also clap praise the name of the Lord what is that you are being loosened you are being delivered and then as you continue in that the atmosphere completely changes somebody who came traveled from home somebody who came with this kind of distress you find yourself that all those things have gone away praise the name of our when demons were traveling s then they would bring David then David would start playing and when David was playing Saul was delivered from his TR that should be the same thing even us when we come to church let us be involved in the worship let us be involved in the song service and then you take time and then you sing with all your heart praise the name of our Lord if is a song of worship or song of Praise You sing with all your heart and you don't care who standing next to you praise the name of our Lord you raise your hands praise the name of our Lord you clap your hands praise the name of the Lord that you are released from all the bondages or even at home praise the name of our Lord you can put on the music gospel music and then it can change your mind it can change the stuation praise the name of the Lord but you see many times people only want put music when they are sorrowful when you go to a funeral place they then they put music there but don't it only when you are sorrowful let it play every day praise the Lord every day Worship the Lord every day sing unto the Lord every day and that's what the Bible tells us let us go to Colossians praise the name of the Lord and then verse chapter 3 verse 16 the Bible says let the word of Christ dwell in you reach in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hyns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord praise the name of our Lord the Bible says singing with Grace in your hearts unto the Lord that should be our life a life of singing a life of praising a life of being thankful Lord I Thank You Lord I bless your Holy Name Lord I glorify your holy name he says you do that praise the name of the Lord if you're not singing aloud then you are singing in your heart praise the name of the Lord a Melody playing how great th art how wonderful you are what you have done for me you know when you think about what the Lord has done and then you just get into worship you get into adoration praise the name of our Lord and you just need to sing unto the Lord praise the name of our Lord in Ephesians 5:8 Ephesians 5:8 he says and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making merod in your heart to the Lord give giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of Lord he says speaking to yourselves in Psalms in hyms in spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord praise the name of our Lord that should be our life continuously but then we have a challenge that there are many new songs that have come and I've taken over praise the name of the Lord and some of this song they only repeat one word only one word and they say it is gospel music then you also take time on only that word no praise the name of Allah we should get songs with a message songs that are really inspired songs that are ordained of the Lord now in the message blind Bas he says oh Po and things certainly th thrill my soul when I read those Godly men that brought them like the S of Life there Long Fellow then he says and I think that God P them things them men of old as it is said in the Bible moved by the Holy Spirit wrote the old blood songs I see a crimson stream of blood all those famous old songs of the church it's a lot better than some of this little old chopped up stuff we have today you know and then I tell you I love that old time religion love all those good old songs of their you know they were inspired they were not singing because of being known but you see nowadays because we have social media some people are inspired by how many likes I'm going to get everybody is saying I like it I like it by how many views I'm going to get but that should not be the inspiration the inspiration should be by the Holy Spirit to deliver the souls of the people praise the name of the Lord when some of these musicians who are secular these people are secular musicians who are secular when they see that there's a gap in gospel music then they also start singing praise the name of the Lord there are quite a number of those [Music] songs you know they just get into a state and then bring one word about Jesus and then you say it is gospel music when they say it is Christmas time and then they talk about and then you also qualified for gospel music no praise the name of the lord it's not for [Music] entertainment it is for worship and transformation and then you see some of these disc cools they bring some of those songs when it is we hours of the night around 300 a.m. 5 p.m. then they start putting some of those songs when they are fully drunk you know that should not be that when you listen to a true gospel song It's a gospel it's a gospel if you a sinner you are convicted praise the name of our Lord you are convicted when you listen to it and then you continue in your wicked way that's not the purpose of it praise the name of our Lord It's meant to bring the spirit of God down when they were singing this songs when they sang this song before Elisha the spirit of God Came Upon Elisha when they sang this song before King Saul the demons left King Saul they should have the same impact even right now praise the name of our Lord so we need those songs that are inspired of the holy spirit that have a message not what brother bam is saying chopped up songs yes yes yes yes that's praise the name of Lord you are saying you are in the Disco you are saying you are in the bar saying you are cheating praise the name of our Lord we need gospel music with the power of God that will change the siners praise the name of our Lord not for entertainment and then everybody is just going around praise the name of our Lord then now in this message the restoration of the Bright Tree he says now when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit different kinds n different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts that's what God's tree he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost now let us stop already so limited with time I'm going to skip down here a few scriptures and go down here to Psalms the first Psalm David saw this tree a long time ago and of his writing of the songs for the something joyful that was the first thing he wrote about that is Psalms 1 you know it was a song then he said he saw the tree and it was planted by the rivers of water this tree then he said he shall be like a tree godest tree planted by the rivers plural rivers of water then he say not a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran so forth no just rivers of one water nine spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit nine fruits of the spirit coming from the same channel he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of what now when we look at Psalms chapter one is a song but that Psalms chapter one is a gospel it teaches you praise the name of our Lord verse one tells let us go Psalms one and verse one is a song Praise the name of our Lord and then the scripture says in verse one of Psalms 1 praise the name of our Lord he says blessed is the man that WTH not in the counil of the ungodly tell me a sinner in the bar singing that song tell me if you will go back to the bar and he loves that song blessed is the man that works not in the C of the ungodly and there in the in the C of the ungodly and the thing is rebuking him how will he sing it there then and stands in the way of the Sinners he's standing in the way of Sinners sth not in the seat of the scold so the more you sing that song the more it convicts you praise the name of the Lord and when it convicts you you repent Lord have mercy upon me praise the name of our Lord I stand in the of Sinners I sit in the seat of scold I stand in the way of wicked people so it changes you it brings a transformation in your life and then vers the Bible says you know verse two is an exchange of verse one instead of sitting in the seat of the SC instead of standing in the way of Sinners instead of you know doing things which are evil what do you do my delight is not to go to the bar praise the name of our Lord my delight is not to go to the sports betting my delight is not to go to fun places but my delight is the word of the Lord what do I do with the word of God I think of that word and night that brings power to your soul praise the name of our Lord those are the kind of songs we should have at home songs that can remind you if you are hating your wife if you are hating your husband if you are hating your parents if you are hating your children and then you sing that song Love Lifted Me from what hatred praise the name of our Lord we need to bring the songs back home and sometimes if you're doing contrary somebody look at your eye praise the name of the Lord we need this songs Back In Our Lives to remind us the love of [Music] God is Rich and it brings you back when you find that you have strayed far oh the love of God is Rich far it will go beyond measures then you know I'm at this bound the love of God can still pick me from those bounds of sin and brings me back into Fellowship praise the name of our Lord we need those kind of songs in our we need to sing those kind of songs in our hearts songs that will bring a transformation songs that will change our thoughts our imaginations if I was going to do something wrong then the song just comes to my heart they say Lord have mer upon Lord deliver me from this kind of situation praise the name of our Lord now in the message Lord I believe he says you know now he was under prayer line the angel of the Lord had come then he says someone holding prayer card 17 would you check someone sitting near you it may be a deaf person if they are in the building why come take your place if you would while we sing this next verse then he says I am so wonderous he from sin Jesus so sweetly abides with the there at the cross where he took me glory to him his name glory to his name glory to his name there to my heart was the blood glory to him praise the name of our Lord what a positive confession that there to my heart the blood was applied and then you can start thinking of those areas the spots there said but Lord you delivered me from life but I'm still despising people I want the blood applied there Lord you delivered me from this funny thing but there's still something I'm still bound it encourages you to keep on pressing keep on moving forward praise the name of our Lord so when he was singing that and then waiting for the person to come then he said I would not swap those songs for all these little choppy songs only one word and that's all I think they are wonderful let us just sing glory to his name the chorus and just shake hands with somebody sitting next to you then he says just turn around or something and Shake Hands come on then he says our heavenly father we thank thee for the thy blessings that we can sing tonight glory to your name for it was there at the cross where he took us in so you sing this song has a message has a meaning it's drawing you where you were delivered so when you are singing it it's putting in thetion at the cross praise the name of our and then you just sing and completely surrender yourself and then you see how the Deliverance comes down in your life you see how the Victor come down in your life praise the name of our Lord not these little little chopped up songs they sing in discour drunkards also just love singing them no praise the name of our Lord then he continues to say for it was there at the cross where he took us in coming unw worthy all undone naked riched blind spiritually speaking and God in his tender Mercy reached down and taken us alienated away from him and God cleansed us from our sins by the blood of his son Jesus Christ and now as positionally set us in Heavenly places with him and now we are Sons and Daughters of God joint hairs with Christ in the Kingdom setting in Heavenly places the Holy Spirit moving upon us oh no wonder our hearts Tremble When we hear those old songs just makes me so glad to you Lord thank you the writers of these old songs is with you tonight God dress their souls until they take the body form again help us Lord As we sing as we sing them to realize that they were meant for what they were meant for give us Grace tonight and the power of the Holy Ghost and now shut down as it was all doubt praise the name of our Lord you know SE gospel music inspired by God praise the name of the Lord and that's what we need but we're living in a time of scus so that's why we need our young people under inspiration of God to write down songs Just David wrote down songs praise the name of our Lord and this we desire and God has been gracious that many started writing those songs songs you don't want to stop listening songs with such a great message songs with such a depth that they even preach to you praise the name of the Lord 3 days I've been in par and then we or we collected the churches we are trying to raise about five or six churches and then we took time preaching on marriage from Thursday up to yesterday just the way they should follow it praise the name of our Lord and then the brothers were asking me why is brother Joshua praise the name of our Lord then I started looking for a song In Praise the name of our Lord a message to them praise the name of our Lord you know something that can Bless the people praise the name of our Lord we had started putting these songs on one of our radio stations here but then the moderator was saying these songs most of them are in English and our people don't understand English so there was a challenge so we need also to bring songs in our local languages song in song ina song in a song in whatever language that it can minister to the needs of the people praise the name of the Lord that we can have a program on radios and we play those songs praise the name of our Lord which can Bless the people a song with a message praise the name of our Lord like I just like listening that song in let me tell you friends and then the message why do you baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy when the name is Jesus Christ somebody sits and starts hearing someon baptizing the name of the father son is a wrong thing it's the name of Jesus Christ women preaching is a wrong thing baptizing little children is a wrong thing it's a message it's a gospel praise the name of our lord it's a preaching that's what we need praise the name of Lord not the songs that excite you a little bit you sing the same [Applause] Stan no gospel praise the name of Lord then brother Bram says okay let us go to another one praise the name of our Lord now in the message blind Bas he said I was thinking of a blind it's a little off my subject but not not so off there was blind fun crossb funny cross cross she could see better than a lot of people go to eyes but she was blind then he says they try to get her one time to write music for a dance world for the entertainment world and she refused to do it so they were making fun of her I thought what a difference it is between her and a certain young Pentecostal boy who set the world a fire with rock and roll rock and roll he was talking about Elvis prle you know he was a Pentecostal on Sunday is in church worshiping Friday night is in Disco halls and everything that kind of thing then he says I've often thought that is worse than Judas es saw this bir right and what a horrible thing that young man will have to answer for the day of judgment sent more souls to H than all the bootle joints that is in the country and then when F cross one day they come to her with big bargains she was poor and they come to her and said we will give you so much we'll give you so much if you'll just give your talent over to making songs for the entertainment world you know the devil is tricky he identifies your gift and he wants you to trade your gift for the world and you see many of these secular musicians they started from church playing instruments what like I remember there's a lady who died and then I think she either something in America I think she was hon and she said started from a church church like that then the entertainment World took her over so now they were challenging this sister funny Crosby CR to enter to write songs for the entertainment world and she was blond she couldn't see so now they came to her we are giving you this amount of money write songs for us you're going to become popular you are going to be the trending star you know trending everywhere and people sell their their talents like that they sell their gifts like that you don't want to know me you don't want to be known you don't want to be known now you do this like this you dress like this you put on like this TR but the sister said no then she said she flat refused it she would not do it she said if there is anything that I have it belongs to Christ praise the name of our Lord that should be the same thing with us he's the one who has made me so whatever I am whatever is good in me it belongs to Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord all the life I live it belongs to Jesus Christ and then he said and so the men who were talking to her say then I suppose you are expecting to go to a world where there's everlasting life and so forth she said yes then they said what do you expect this Christ to be say it be a man now she was a blind person they were talking to who would be this Christ she will be he will be a man and said then if you are the same over there as you are [Music] here you never seen him say it you are blind she said oh will know him anyhow so they said how would do you ever know him if you are still blind over there as you never had cited in this life on the other side if you had no sight there how will you know him this how the devil wants to water down your face ah you are singing in face nobody cares about what you're see nobody can give you lights nobody can make you trendy that's not so praise the name of the Lord It's a message going to the people God has chosen praise the name of our Lord and then he said so she said say how would you ever know him if you are blind he said I will know him and they laughed at her and she turned and setted through the house and when she had made her decision no sir nothing of the world all my talent is to Christ they said she started back across the house and raised up our hearts and said I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand they challenged her she made the right decision I shall know him and immediately the inspiration of the song struck I shall know him praise the name of the Lord those are exp have been passing through I shall know him like I remember the first time we had original songs in in a great number here I'm just forgetting the song and this song was sung by Brother William and it was strange the message of the song reflected his station at that time he was sick he was put on a canul dripping he goes there they treat him and then he comes and sings Here praise the name of the Lord some of these songs have a depth and the meaning sometimes is even reflected physically like the children of Israel when they had crossed the Red Sea and then they saw their enemies on the water a song came forth a new song came forth and even now the sister f crossb they challenging her you are blind how you know him then God inspired her I shall know him I will touch at his hands and then I will know this is my Lord praise the name of our Lord so we need to really see that our songs have a depth to them brings Deliverance to us praise the name of our Lord and not only this are singing But even us let us be taken by the spirit of worship praise the name of our Lord to know this message is mine this song is mine this song is ministering to my name praise the name of our Lord and then he says by the prince of the nails in his hand it is those great crucial moments that that the strain is put upon us God moves in when we make the decision for him that's between life and death that little sharp ede sometime at the last moment when you are you think you are not going to be well and somebody is making fun of you still hold your testimony it's that time that God moves praise the name of our Lord I want to get also another one here praise the name of our Lord I see my time has gone so then he says in the another message God in his people praise the name of our Lord he says that old fun crossb okay let us start from this one he says one time there was was a man he was writing one day and he was right trying to write a song he couldn't do it and he didn't know what to do and all at once there was a song that came to another man by the name of Eddie ponet Ed sitting in a room and suddenly there came a spirit of God upon him and he grabbed his pain and he wrote All held the power of Jesus's name let Angels prostrate for bring forth their Royal [Music] D and crown him Lord of all old funny cross who could never SE daylight sitting in a room one day God came upon his blind poet and when she did wrot Pass Me Not gentle say here my humble cry while others are calling do not pass me by Praise the name of our Lord blind Spirit coming down and then the inspiration strikes praise the name of our Lord we need to see that we sing those songs we need to see that those are the songs we play at our homes or we play in our our cars songs praise the name of our Lord that are inspired of God that can bring Deliverance to us praise the name of our Lord singing of the great things of What the Lord Has Done For Us Praise the name of our Lord when Jesus was born praise the name of our Lord Angels were heard praising rejoicing of What the Lord Has Done praise the name of our Lord you know so many times and you see like in heaven the Angels Sing they s sing songs of praise songs of worship holy holy holy holy is the Lord God how about us praise the name of the Lord singing in your heart with Melody praise the name of our Lord let singing rejoicing be part of our Lives praise the name of our Lord you may not have a cassette or maybe MP3 or maybe a phone with what but you know you take time and learn the songs and then you sing them praise the name of our Lord you rejoice it blesses your soul you are maybe at a place of work then you can play that music softly you know we live in the age where many people are mad and many people are M they don't have access to this good music play for them and then some of those demons will start going away when you started playing that song the troubles left me and then you'll see somehow people will try to come where you are because there is peace there praise the name of our Lord then you can get opportunity to talk to them about Christ to deliver them to release them to set them free praise the name of the Lord we are ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord if you can't preach there is a song you can use to preach praise the name of our Lord playing it there down at the cross why are my savior di Pass Me Not Gentle Savior it's a sermon somebody will listen and say hey why is this song can you give me a copy praise the name of our Lord and then it will help that person next time you can tell them why don't we come why don't you come and we go to worship with you come and we go to church maybe get this message book read this kind of thing praise the name of you are taking Christ to the people praise the name of our Lord we also need to sing learn how to sing praise the name of our Lord and see that we can bless God praise the name of our Lord and even help the people who live amongst us to know the power of God to know how the Lord Works in our M praise the name of our Lord singing the Lord a new song Praise the name of our Lord and every testimony that you give is like a new song how the Lord has pass me through this in Revelations chapter 5 when the lamp came to get the book The Bible says the 24 elders and all the other 10 thousands of days let us read that as I finish praise the name of

fell down before the laamb having every one of them HS and golden vs full of orders which are the prayers of the Saints for and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and thou Hast made unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth praise the name of the Lord then verse 10 praise the name of our Lord the Bible says they sang a new song a song of redemption you are worthy Lord receive honor receive praise for what you

[Music] [Applause] you Hallelujah we are still around my colleagues were running away so um the next song is called good for Hallelujah I've been struggling you know I'm at all um but he's good and U the Bible says God will do nothing which he has not revealed so yeah even this that just happened God knew it that it will happen and um I wrote this song um some years back I think it's 21 yeah around there and uh I wrote it during u a suon which was being preached by Brother andrias Ren I I happened not to have attended the first service so I attended the afternoon service but as you know if we accustomed to brother and rers preaching they'll start preaching before you even sit down so I didn't grasp the the the the title of the salmon well so I can't really figure it out what the title was but the message is I got and U you know I love visiting ministers because they always bring A New Perspective to certain things you know and when you writer the converse you work with are ideas perspective experiences but the way this man was preaching about the goodness of God was something that would really make you start scratching your head you know he says God will do nothing which he has not revealed and then the the most really uh great line in his preaching that caught my eye he said God becomes good when evil happens in your life and then as I was still processing that he said um um can you flash for me the the second verse yeah he said you see evil is permitted but not excused I took some time digesting that and then as I was to digesting he said God is confident that you his child you will win all you have to do is blow up the devil I didn't know that we actually supposed to blow up the devil so that was quite an interesting interesting lines there but all of in God do he has just be confident his intention and everything God will do [Music] nothing he has not just be confident and never he's good join us quite a simple song Jesus is good God becomes good when evil happens in [Music] your my Jesus is goodus is good [Music] oh see is pered but not Excuse excuse godil see evil [Music] evil God how good my Jesus [Music] is good goodus [Music] is Jesus [Music] is that you you shall up the and make you feel Jesus [Music] is shall we I make PR he goodus Jesus Is God When evil Happ [Music] Inus goodus is good [Music] window [Music] TR [Music] redem the

from the message [Music] [Music] we [Music] reading from the message 50 0824 that's where the inspiration is Good from paragraph 33 50 824 paragraph 33 says now God made a contract with the peoples of this world therefore he sent the Son of God and killed him on Calvary you believe that all we like sheep have gone astray God laid upon him the iniquity of all he was wounded for our transgressions Ro for our iniquity [Music] the chest of our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed that was God's contract to the church is that right then God killed the lamb at Calvary do you believe that and from him he tore him AP part he took part of it the body up into Glory set it on the right hand of the Majesty you believe it and the Holy Spirit he sent back to the people is that right then when it comes together when this contract is come together at the day of the Judgment the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost is grouping around and bunch of people it will go it will it will go right back to that somebody [Music] to D tail right into the somebody it's a contract God bless [Music] you I was the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve I was with Moses the children of Israel cross

book of Acts 1 verse 4 to8 so acts 1 verse 4 it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which sayith he you have heard of me for trly John baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou res will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times all the seasons which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth another scripture for the inspiration comes from The Book of Joel 2 verse 28 it says and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your younger men shall see Vision God bless you [Music] [Music] to be a through thy holy word Lord to be able to live and through the anointed word through the

said Simon Simon behold Satan has desire to have you that he may shift you as we but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy bre bless you and then says master I want to walk to you I don't know how far he was from the boat and the [Music] master and then he began to walk but the master himself knows how to prove that it's not ourselves but it is him he allowed the stor to come and when the storm came the faith of Peter was diminishing in the face of a stone and he was sinking but the faith of Jesus Christ the gift of God extended the hand and he was able to walk on the water amen by the gift of faith which is the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and now it's the same Faith which has saved you he doesn't save you today to lose you tomorrow I'm not saying you will not make mistakes in life but because it's the Faith of Christ he prayed for you so that your faith not amen and so by this faith we continue our PRM Journey amen through this
