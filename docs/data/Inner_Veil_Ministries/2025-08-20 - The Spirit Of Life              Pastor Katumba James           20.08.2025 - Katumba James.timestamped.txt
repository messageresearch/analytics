[9:36] prophet, you've given us the anointing,
[9:39] Lord, which is keeping us, Lord, as it
[9:41] is written, in the days of the voice,
[9:43] Lord. Indeed, Father, we are not in the
[9:46] presence of the man Malachi followed,
[9:48] but we are the people, Lord, living in
[9:50] the days of the voice, Lord, the prophet
[9:52] has gone ahead of us. And father is left

[20:42] you and magnify your holy name. In the
[20:44] name of Jesus Christ we grant us this.
[20:47] Amen. Let us turn to our Bibles.
[20:51] We are going to the book of Romans
[20:54] chapter 8. We're reading from verse 1 up
[20:59] to verse 9.
[21:04] [Music]
[21:14] this evening part of my family which
[21:16] lives in Mukono they around
[21:19] my sister Lydia if you can raise up your
[21:21] hand she's there together with Becky
[21:24] Jared Esther and even my daughter Plet
[21:27] is back from school and also Prisca we
[21:31] thank God that they've been able to join
[21:35] So Romans, we're reading Romans chapter
[21:38] 8
[21:40] and then verse one to verse 9.
[21:44] [Music]
[21:48] Romans chapter 8 from verse one to verse
[21:50] 9.
[21:51] [Music]
[21:55] The scripture says,
[21:58] "There is therefore now no condemnation
[22:01] to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
[22:05] walk not after the flesh, but after the
[22:07] spirit,
[22:13] [Music]
[22:18] &gt;&gt; for the law of the spirit of life in
[22:20] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[22:24] law of sin and death.
[22:32] [Music]
[22:42] law could not do in that it was weak
[22:45] through the flesh. God sending his own
[22:48] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[22:51] for sin condemned sin in the flesh.
[23:00] [Music]
[23:11] [Music]
[23:19] that the spirit that the righteousness
[23:22] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[23:26] walk not after the flesh but after the
[23:28] spirit.
[23:37] For they that are after the flesh do
[23:40] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[23:42] that are after the spirit the things of
[23:45] the spirit.
[23:53] For to be minded is death, but to be
[23:56] spiritually minded is life and peace.
[24:05] Because the carnal mind is enimity
[24:08] against God. For it is not subject to
[24:11] the law of God. Neither indeed can be.
[24:18] [Music]
[24:26] So then they that are in the flesh
[24:29] cannot please God.
[24:36] But you are not in the flesh but in the
[24:39] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[24:43] dwell in you. Now if any man have not
[24:46] the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[24:54] [Music]
[25:05] May God bless of his word. You may be
[25:08] seated.
[25:10] Praise the name of our Lord. So this
[25:13] evening by the grace of God.
[25:17] I'm picking the subject from verse two.
[25:22] The spirit of life.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; The spirit of life is what we want. take
[25:29] some bit of time.
[25:32] Most of the Wednesdays we've been
[25:34] ministering here.
[25:38] We've been talking about the Holy
[25:40] Spirit.
[25:42] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[25:44] yesterday I was just in my meditations
[25:50] and it came strongly on me to speak
[25:52] about the spirit of life
[25:57] which could be more of a summary
[26:01] which could be a summary
[26:04] you know all what we've been talking
[26:06] about
[26:08] about the spirit of God of the Holy
[26:10] Spirit.
[26:13] Now the spirit of life
[26:16] is the Holy Spirit.
[26:20] The spirit of life is the spirit of God.
[26:26] The spirit of life is the spirit of
[26:29] Christ.
[26:31] There's really no difference.
[26:34] Now in the message what is the Holy
[26:36] Ghost?
[26:39] Brother Brandham says, "How could we go
[26:42] into details of that
[26:46] and break down
[26:48] of how when of how when it it makes
[26:52] intercession for our ignorance?
[26:55] [Music]
[26:59] He was talking about the Holy Spirit
[27:01] that the Holy Spirit makes intercession
[27:07] for our ignorance.
[27:10] Sometimes when we got the Holy Ghost,
[27:14] we ignorantly stagger into something.
[27:20] The Holy Spirit
[27:22] is there to make advocate for us.
[27:27] He is our advocator.
[27:30] He stands there. He is our attorney.
[27:37] He stands there
[27:40] and pleads for us.
[27:44] We don't plead for ourself
[27:47] because the Holy Ghost
[27:50] in us pleads for us.
[27:54] the Holy Spirit
[27:57] giving utterance
[28:00] sometimes with words you can't
[28:03] understand.
[28:06] You know, you can get that in Romans
[28:08] chapter 8.
[28:11] And then in verse 26,
[28:15] he says, "Likewise, the spirit also
[28:18] helps our infirmities.
[28:24] For we know not what we should pray for
[28:27] as we ought,
[28:32] but the Spirit itself
[28:36] makes intercession for us
[28:39] with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[28:44] And then he that searches the hearts
[28:48] knows what is the mind of the spirit.
[28:53] because he makes intercession for the
[28:55] saints
[28:58] according to the will of God.
[29:02] Now you see God gives us his spirit
[29:07] in a measure.
[29:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Just on the
[29:12] day of Pentecost
[29:14] when the Holy Ghost came down from
[29:16] heaven,
[29:19] there appeared tongues of fire.
[29:24] You know, I would just describe it like
[29:26] this way
[29:27] like when you light a candle
[29:30] and then there is there is wind
[29:34] you know that fire on the candle know
[29:36] the way it shakes like that.
[29:41] So even on the day of Pentecost,
[29:44] they were seeing on each other's head
[29:48] a tongue of fire.
[29:51] A tongue of fire. And you know the Bible
[29:54] says when the Holy Ghost came down from
[29:57] heaven,
[29:59] he divided himself.
[30:02] You know like the Luganda brings it out.
[30:04] Well,
[30:06] when we go to the book of Acts chapter
[30:08] 2,
[30:12] and then the scripture says,
[30:15] &gt;&gt; verse three, "And there appeared unto
[30:18] them cloven tanks like as of fire, and
[30:21] it sat upon each of them." You listen to
[30:23] the Luganda now.
[30:34] You see dividing himself.
[30:37] So we get a measure of God
[30:41] that comes down in our lives.
[30:45] And now that measure of God
[30:48] is the Holy Spirit.
[30:50] And then the Bible is telling us that
[30:53] the Holy Spirit knows the mind of God.
[30:59] Praise the name of our Lord. The Holy
[31:01] Spirit knows the will of God.
[31:05] So now when the Holy Spirit comes in us,
[31:09] he will always make sure that he leads
[31:11] us by the will of God.
[31:16] And now because we live in these bodies,
[31:20] sometimes you are always resistant to
[31:22] the move of God
[31:26] or sometimes like brother has said
[31:30] We ignorantly stagger into something.
[31:35] You find you are in trouble.
[31:38] You find you are trespassing
[31:41] and the Holy Spirit in you.
[31:44] Intercede
[31:48] you know and then says restore him back.
[31:52] Take him back to the path of truth.
[31:56] Sometimes you are in darkness.
[31:59] You know, you don't exactly what to do,
[32:02] but then the spirit of God comes around
[32:06] and lightens the path.
[32:09] Praise the name of our Lord. Sometimes
[32:11] you are in a junction of life.
[32:15] You don't know which decision to make.
[32:18] That's why you need to learn to rely on
[32:20] the Holy Spirit.
[32:23] When you get stuck in your life, when
[32:26] you get stuck in your life,
[32:30] you know, you take time,
[32:33] commit the issue before the hand of God.
[32:36] Lord, this is the challenge that I'm
[32:38] having. Lord, I can't move any further.
[32:42] Lord, I'm stuck here.
[32:45] You know, you may not know the way. You
[32:47] may not know the path ahead, but at
[32:50] least know that the Lord is there with
[32:52] me
[32:53] to guide you through the challenges of
[32:55] life.
[32:57] That's why he sent the Holy Spirit in
[32:59] our lives
[33:01] that the Holy Spirit can guide us.
[33:05] The Holy Ghost can lead us.
[33:08] The Holy Ghost can reveal himself to us.
[33:12] So now you it's better if you have
[33:15] accepted the Lord Jesus as your personal
[33:17] savior
[33:20] see that you receive the baptism of the
[33:22] Holy Spirit.
[33:25] Praise the name of our Lord because he
[33:28] says
[33:30] that he intercedes for us
[33:33] according to the will of God. So we go
[33:36] back to the message what is the Holy
[33:38] Ghost.
[33:40] So he says
[33:43] the Holy Spirit
[33:45] giving utterance
[33:49] sometimes with words you can't
[33:51] understand
[33:54] and sometimes the Holy Spirit can come
[33:57] upon you
[33:59] and makes you to start interceding for
[34:02] somebody else.
[34:05] You think about somebody then you get a
[34:08] burden then you start praying for that
[34:11] person. Say Lord have mercy upon this.
[34:14] Sometimes somebody has done you wrong
[34:17] and then you remember it. Then say Lord
[34:20] have mercy upon my brother. Lord have
[34:22] mercy upon my sister.
[34:26] You are interceding for them. Praise the
[34:29] name of our Lord. Not again to say Lord
[34:31] that person has done me wrong.
[34:35] May he get a punishment?
[34:37] [Music]
[34:38] &gt;&gt; No, that's not it.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; But you see, you intercede also.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; You carry that burden.
[34:47] You become your brother's keeper.
[34:50] You become your sister's keeper.
[34:54] Error into something.
[34:56] So you stand in the gap interceding to
[34:59] God. Help my brother.
[35:03] My sister, deliver them Lord.
[35:07] Praise the name of our Lord. It's very
[35:09] good to have the Holy Spirit in your
[35:10] life.
[35:13] Then he says, "When I walk into
[35:15] anything,
[35:17] I walk like a little kid.
[35:20] You walk like a little fellow.
[35:24] We are walking in a dark world
[35:29] full of enemies
[35:32] full of sin
[35:35] full of traps
[35:38] full of everything.
[35:41] Oh, you say I'm afraid to take Christian
[35:44] Christian life.
[35:47] I'm afraid to do this. I'm afraid to do
[35:50] this.
[35:52] Don't be afraid.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. Why
[35:56] shouldn't you be afraid?
[35:59] We have got an advocate.
[36:01] [Music]
[36:02] He knows the way. Praise the name of our
[36:05] Lord. He knows the path to take.
[36:09] He stands by us.
[36:14] He is in us and he makes intercessions
[36:19] for us.
[36:21] The Bible has said in Romans chapter 8,
[36:25] make intercessions for us
[36:28] according to our infirmities.
[36:30] [Music]
[36:32] Praise the name of our Lord. Whatever
[36:34] infirmity you have,
[36:36] just lift it in the hand of the Lord.
[36:39] Lord, this is my weakness. Lord, this is
[36:41] my failure. Lord, this is where I'm
[36:43] ering. Lord, I'm not good in this area.
[36:47] Lord, help me in this area.
[36:50] be free and talk to the Lord about it
[36:53] praise the name of our Lord. You know
[36:55] the Bible says whoever shall call upon
[36:58] the name of the Lord
[37:00] shall be saved. So in whatever situation
[37:04] see that you call upon the name of the
[37:06] Lord.
[37:08] I'm calling upon your name and help me
[37:11] in this weakness. That's why the Lord
[37:13] send the Holy Ghost.
[37:15] You know the Bible says that the Holy
[37:18] Spirit,
[37:20] praise the name of our Lord, when you
[37:22] read in Ephesians chapter one
[37:27] and then verse 13,
[37:30] we can go to verse 14 directly.
[37:34] Praise the name of our Lord.
[37:38] Ephesians chapter 1 verse1 14.
[37:42] The Bible says
[37:45] which is the earnest of our inheritance.
[37:50] So the Holy Spirit is the earnest
[37:55] is a downp payment
[37:58] is an assurance.
[38:01] Praise the name of our Lord. When you
[38:03] have the Holy Spirit, you are assured by
[38:07] God.
[38:09] God has assured you that all his
[38:12] promises,
[38:15] everything you have need of in this life
[38:19] is already given to us in the Holy
[38:20] Spirit.
[38:23] So now it's you to call upon the name of
[38:25] the Lord.
[38:27] Lord, there is a weakness I have.
[38:30] I think evil thoughts.
[38:33] Then you call on the God.
[38:36] Let the Holy Ghost come in that area
[38:41] to remove the desire to do evil things,
[38:46] to remove the desire for funny things in
[38:48] your life.
[38:51] And the Holy Spirit will take away those
[38:55] things that are contrary to the word of
[38:57] God.
[38:59] He brings his own righteousness.
[39:02] He brings his own life there.
[39:06] That's how we depend upon the Lord.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So then he
[39:12] says,
[39:13] "Don't be afraid."
[39:16] We have an advocate.
[39:19] Amen. Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; He stands by us. He is in us and makes
[39:25] intercessions for us.
[39:27] The Holy Spirit.
[39:31] See what brother Brandham is saying.
[39:34] constantly.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[39:41] &gt;&gt; He constantly,
[39:44] &gt;&gt; you know, he constantly
[39:47] making an advocate for us all the time.
[39:53] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[39:55] need to desire to have the spirit of God
[39:57] in your life.
[40:00] He is our advocator.
[40:03] Oh, how we thank God for that.
[40:06] A seal,
[40:08] a sign,
[40:11] the spirit of life,
[40:14] the God of heaven,
[40:17] the comforter,
[40:19] the life, the advocate,
[40:22] what is he?
[40:25] Oh my, we could go on for hours with it.
[40:32] Praise the name of the Lord. The Holy
[40:35] Spirit is the one that starts our
[40:38] salvation.
[40:41] You can never start your salvation. You
[40:44] cannot say
[40:50] you cannot say I was sleeping and I
[40:52] thought I
[40:56] then I brought myself here and I got
[40:58] saved. No,
[41:00] there is nothing good in you to begin
[41:02] with.
[41:05] It is the Holy Spirit
[41:08] that brings the conviction
[41:12] in your life.
[41:14] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in John
[41:16] chapter 16
[41:19] and then verse 7
[41:22] the Bible says, "Nevertheless, I tell
[41:25] you the truth,
[41:27] it is expedient for you that I go away.
[41:36] For if I go not away,
[41:40] the comforter will not come unto you.
[41:46] But if I depart,
[41:49] I will send him unto you.
[41:54] And why does he send him? In verse
[41:57] eight, he says
[41:59] when he is come,
[42:02] he will reprove the world of sin.
[42:06] Now to reprove
[42:09] is to convict.
[42:13] He says he will reprove the world of sin
[42:18] and of righteousness
[42:20] and of judgment
[42:22] of sin because they believe not on me.
[42:28] So now when the Holy Spirit comes
[42:32] when he comes to the sinner
[42:35] he convicts the sinner.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. That's
[42:40] where the Holy Ghost starts working upon
[42:42] our lives
[42:46] by conviction.
[42:49] Say, "No, no, no, no, no. I don't want
[42:52] to continue this path anymore. I no
[42:54] longer want to be rebellious before God.
[42:58] I don't want to live in my sin.
[43:01] I don't want to be as if as I've been.
[43:04] The things that I do, I no longer want
[43:06] them."
[43:08] Then you start thinking where you can be
[43:10] helped.
[43:12] Where can I be delivered?
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. And then as
[43:18] he convicts you,
[43:21] praise the name of our Lord because the
[43:23] conviction
[43:25] comes by the word of God.
[43:28] You know the word of God convicts you
[43:32] and then when he convicts you,
[43:35] praise the name of the Lord. by the Holy
[43:38] Spirit himself,
[43:41] he leads you into justification.
[43:44] So it is the Holy Spirit
[43:47] that convicts us.
[43:50] So it's the Holy Spirit
[43:53] that justifies us.
[43:55] It is the Holy Spirit that sanctifies
[43:59] us. And it's the same Holy Spirit
[44:04] that fills us.
[44:07] Now where is the Holy Spirit?
[44:10] You know for me I live in
[44:13] but you know the
[44:15] when will I get it?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Now who told you that the Holy Spirit is
[44:20] in you know I'm just down here at
[44:24] justification.
[44:27] I don't know when when I will get the
[44:28] Holy Ghost.
[44:31] It's the Holy Ghost justifying you.
[44:34] away the Holy Ghost. Now,
[44:37] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord. So, the
[44:39] work of salvation
[44:42] is all of the Lord.
[44:45] That's what it is. All our salvation
[44:49] has been done by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:52] So, for you, what you are meant to do
[44:56] to accept the finished work.
[45:01] Accept the finished work.
[45:03] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in
[45:05] Romans chapter 8 where we've read from
[45:07] verse 10 to verse 11,
[45:11] [Music]
[45:15] he says, "And if Christ be in you,
[45:21] the body is dead
[45:25] because of sin, but the spirit is life
[45:32] because of righteousness.
[45:36] Now I just want to take some bit of time
[45:38] here.
[45:39] He says the spirit is life
[45:44] because of righteousness.
[45:47] In other words, the spirit of God
[45:52] brings life to us
[45:55] because of righteousness.
[45:57] Then what is righteousness?
[46:02] Now in
[46:03] Romans chapter 4,
[46:07] &gt;&gt; praise the name of our Lord.
[46:10] And then verse five,
[46:16] the Bible says, "But to him that
[46:19] workketh not,
[46:22] but believeth on him,
[46:27] that justifyth the ungodly,
[46:34] his face
[46:37] is counted for righteousness.
[46:43] Now our righteousness
[46:46] comes as a result of faith.
[46:51] Now the Bible says
[46:53] Abraham believed God
[46:57] and it was counted unto him for
[47:00] righteousness.
[47:03] See how the Lord makes us righteous.
[47:08] God makes us righteous
[47:11] by believing his word.
[47:14] Praise the name of our Lord.
[47:17] Let us speak the the scripture here
[47:19] again
[47:22] in Genesis.
[47:33] The book of Genesis. Let me get it here.
[47:39] Genesis chapter 17.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, I beg your pardon. Genesis chapter
[47:46] 16.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Okay, rather it's Genesis chapter 15 and
[47:55] verse 6.
[48:01] We can get the an we can pick it up from
[48:06] verse three.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And Abraham said, "Behold to me, thou
[48:11] has not given no seed, and lo, one born
[48:14] in my house is mine hair."
[48:25] And behold, the word of the Lord came
[48:27] unto him, saying, This shall not be your
[48:29] hair, but he that shall come forth out
[48:34] of thy own bowels shall be your hair.
[48:50] Now you look at Abraham,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; a very old man,
[48:56] and the Bible says, "Even Sarah had
[48:59] seized going through her periods."
[49:07] And then God tells Abraham,
[49:11] "Look at the stars.
[49:15] That's how your seed shall be.
[49:19] And he will come from your loins."
[49:23] Abraham old.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Sarah old,
[49:28] no more periods.
[49:31] Then Abra Abraham
[49:34] when he when God said come out and see
[49:41] look toward the heaven
[49:44] tell the stars
[49:47] if you are able to number them
[49:50] and he said unto him
[49:53] so shall your seed be
[49:58] taking God at his word.
[50:01] That's what we meant to do. We need to
[50:03] take God at his word.
[50:06] If the Lord has made any promise to us,
[50:10] the Bible says there are two immutable
[50:13] things
[50:15] to God. He swore by himself.
[50:20] So if we swore by himself, he says
[50:23] whatever I have said,
[50:25] I'm going to fulfill it. Then the second
[50:28] immutable thing,
[50:31] God cannot lie.
[50:34] So whatever he says to you,
[50:38] you receive it by faith.
[50:41] Like Abraham, so when Abraham looked at
[50:44] the stars,
[50:46] praise the name of our Lord. And each of
[50:48] those stars
[50:51] was representing the names in the Lamb's
[50:53] book of life.
[50:55] Praise
[50:57] the name of our Lord. The stars the
[51:00] stars were in different they appear in
[51:03] different sizes.
[51:10] And you know when when people studed the
[51:12] the skies
[51:15] they know that this is near, this one is
[51:17] far. This one is what?
[51:22] Praise the name of our Lord. So he saw
[51:24] the seed.
[51:26] He saw the names in the lamb's book of
[51:28] life.
[51:30] Jesus was representing a name.
[51:35] Praise the name of our Lord. Do you
[51:37] believe that? Should I ask you a
[51:39] question? Did Abraham see you?
[51:47] &gt;&gt; If you in the Lamb's book of life, I saw
[51:51] your representation there. Praise the
[51:53] name of the Lord. You know, you have to
[51:55] take these things by faith.
[51:58] Abraham saw me. Praise the name of the
[52:01] Lord. When God was asking Job,
[52:04] why were you
[52:07] when the morning star sang for joy,
[52:11] praise the name of our Lord. So now the
[52:13] Bible says in verse six,
[52:16] and he believed in the Lord.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Do you also believe in the Lord?
[52:23] Praise the name of the Lord. And when he
[52:25] believed in the Lord,
[52:28] it was counted unto him for
[52:31] righteousness.
[52:35] Praise the name of our Lord. So then the
[52:37] Bible told us in Romans 8:10
[52:43] that the spirit of life,
[52:46] the spirit is life
[52:50] because of righteousness.
[52:53] So now when the Holy Spirit speaks to
[52:55] you the word of God
[52:59] and then you believe the word of God
[53:02] then it is counted unto you for
[53:05] righteousness.
[53:08] And now when you receive the
[53:09] righteousness
[53:12] that's how life starts working in us.
[53:16] That's how the spirit of life
[53:19] becomes effective in our lives.
[53:24] When we hear the word of God,
[53:27] we believe the word of God
[53:30] because the Bible says, the spirit is
[53:33] life
[53:36] that is to us. The spirit of God, the
[53:40] Holy Spirit becomes life to us
[53:45] when we believe the word of God.
[53:48] If you want the spirit of God to be life
[53:52] in you,
[53:55] just accept the word of God.
[53:58] So the spirit of life
[54:00] becomes active in your life
[54:05] when you obey the word of God.
[54:09] So we are called to obey the word of
[54:11] God.
[54:13] We are called to believe the word of
[54:15] God.
[54:16] And this is what the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:18] says
[54:21] in John chapter 7.
[54:24] Praise the name of our Lord.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; John chapter 7.
[54:29] And then verse 37.
[54:33] In the last day, that great day of the
[54:35] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[54:38] "If a man thirst, let him come unto me
[54:42] and drink.
[54:54] [Music]
[54:56] He that believeth on me, as the
[54:59] scripture has said, out of his belly
[55:02] shall flow rivers of living water.
[55:14] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Out
[55:17] of your belly
[55:20] if you just keep on believing.
[55:25] If you just keep on obeying.
[55:28] So you stimulate that river to keep on
[55:30] flowing.
[55:33] And that's how we live a true Christian
[55:35] life.
[55:37] have the opportunity of hearing the word
[55:39] of God.
[55:41] Coming to church the way we have come
[55:44] you've come to drink from the fountain.
[55:48] So when you receive the word Lord this
[55:51] is mine allow that word to bring a
[55:53] transformation in your life
[55:57] in the morning in your prayer time
[56:00] you know wait on the Lord read the word
[56:03] of God maybe in the evening
[56:06] reading the word of God meditating upon
[56:09] the word of God what are you doing you
[56:12] are drinking and as you keep on drinking
[56:15] you are receiving more of the life
[56:19] and as you keep on receiving more of the
[56:20] life
[56:22] you know that fountain keeps on pushing
[56:24] away the trash in your life
[56:28] you know the trashes you've got through
[56:30] maybe Facebook
[56:33] on Tik Tok on YouTube or when you are
[56:37] walking on the road
[56:39] funny things you've seen funny things
[56:42] you've heard when you drink from the
[56:44] living fountain mountain
[56:47] flushes them out
[56:49] and then you find yourself that you are
[56:51] stronger
[56:54] even to stand before any challenge that
[56:56] comes in your life.
[57:00] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[57:03] message here
[57:06] he says
[57:08] one in a million
[57:11] and Christ died for you
[57:15] &gt;&gt; and you are transplanted from the world
[57:18] into Christ
[57:25] and everything you have need of
[57:29] is right in you.
[57:33] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[57:36] Isn't that right? Now, the only thing
[57:39] you have to do
[57:42] is just start drinking from that,
[57:46] praise the name of the Lord, you keep
[57:49] drinking.
[57:51] Then he says, "And as the tree drinks,
[57:56] it brings it begins to push out leaves.
[58:01] It's bad
[58:05] pushes out its fruit each year.
[58:10] The fruit is not in the ground.
[58:16] The fruit is in the plant.
[58:20] How many understand that? Say amen.
[58:24] So see the fruit is in the plant.
[58:30] And every plant has to drink from this
[58:32] fountain.
[58:36] And the rain comes down.
[58:40] Gives the plant life
[58:44] to drink from.
[58:46] As it drinks,
[58:50] it grows.
[58:51] And as it is growing up until it comes
[58:54] to the full bird.
[58:59] just like the church has
[59:02] to bloom out in this age.
[59:06] [Music]
[59:08] And as we drink,
[59:11] we grow.
[59:13] But if the plant refuses to drink,
[59:17] then the plant cannot grow.
[59:21] And if you will just believe it now
[59:25] individually,
[59:27] praise the name of our Lord, the spirit
[59:29] of life, it's a living fountain.
[59:34] So you have to keep on drinking.
[59:37] And as you drink and to drink is to
[59:40] believe.
[59:42] To drink is to obey.
[59:44] And then you see that spirit take over
[59:46] your thoughts.
[59:51] where you are thinking bad things.
[59:55] The spirit takes over. You think
[59:58] positive things.
[1:00:01] You stop thinking about negative things.
[1:00:05] You start thinking about things that are
[1:00:07] concerned with the word of God.
[1:00:11] And as your mind is changed,
[1:00:15] then even what you speak
[1:00:18] because you speak your thoughts.
[1:00:20] So your thoughts have been changed.
[1:00:23] So even the words you speak.
[1:00:27] You are no longer negative.
[1:00:29] You are no longer that kind of hard
[1:00:32] person.
[1:00:35] Somebody who slanders others,
[1:00:39] you know, somebody who kind of
[1:00:42] blackmails others,
[1:00:46] the words change because the mind has
[1:00:49] been changed
[1:00:51] and then you find that even your actions
[1:00:53] are changing, what you are doing are
[1:00:55] changing. Why? Because you are drinking
[1:01:00] and the change of mind.
[1:01:03] Praise the name of our Lord is growth.
[1:01:07] They change the way you speak.
[1:01:10] You are no longer cursing all the time.
[1:01:13] But your blessing
[1:01:16] is growth.
[1:01:18] You used to go to the discourse.
[1:01:22] You used to go to the bars.
[1:01:24] You used to go to funny places.
[1:01:27] But now that spirit of God in you
[1:01:32] cannot tolerate going to those places.
[1:01:37] So you have you are growing
[1:01:39] there is a change in your life.
[1:01:42] If they start counting drunkards
[1:01:47] and they go to do a roll call in the bar
[1:01:52] your name there disappears. Ah this one
[1:01:55] no longer is our member.
[1:01:59] even stopped subscription last year
[1:02:04] and even the seat has been taken over by
[1:02:06] somebody
[1:02:09] that is growth.
[1:02:11] Praise the name of our lord. You know
[1:02:14] brother is in right now.
[1:02:19] Now there was a witch doctor a a chief
[1:02:21] witch doctor in that whole place.
[1:02:27] And he took him I think early this year.
[1:02:31] He took him and all his witches and
[1:02:35] shrines and everything.
[1:02:39] And then this witch doctor had a son was
[1:02:41] also a witch doctor in Campala.
[1:02:46] You know even some of these good music
[1:02:48] go there some of them are shrines.
[1:02:52] So he was renting somewhere and he had
[1:02:54] shrines on where he was renting.
[1:02:58] So the father told him manh me I've got
[1:03:01] saved you come and come. Because the
[1:03:03] father was supplying the son.
[1:03:11] So he accepted the lord Jesus. They were
[1:03:14] baptized in the name of Jesus.
[1:03:17] Now on Monday,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; this wid doctor is above 70 years.
[1:03:26] The wife passed on unfortunately.
[1:03:30] And he said me I'm saved.
[1:03:34] I can never allow my wife to be buried
[1:03:37] like which doctors.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; So they had to call the brother and he
[1:03:42] went there yesterday. He went there. He
[1:03:44] went there before yesterday.
[1:03:49] I think he went yesterday and then the
[1:03:51] burial was yesterday.
[1:03:54] So now
[1:03:56] they when the village saw these people
[1:03:58] saying that the witch doctor refusing to
[1:04:00] bury the wife
[1:04:05] and said the pastor who converted me is
[1:04:07] coming to bury.
[1:04:12] So when he reached there, people were
[1:04:14] amazed.
[1:04:16] This man is serious.
[1:04:19] So all the neighbors
[1:04:23] and even other witch doctors, two of
[1:04:24] them,
[1:04:27] 20 people got saved yesterday at the
[1:04:29] funeral.
[1:04:32] And now the man's name has changed from
[1:04:34] a witch doctor to locally.
[1:04:40] And then he was when brother brother was
[1:04:43] preaching about the bodies in heaven.
[1:04:48] He said oh God when is my time to go
[1:04:50] into that body.
[1:04:53] Said I thank God my wife has gone to
[1:04:55] that body.
[1:04:58] Me I'm ready to go there now.
[1:05:02] There is a change in his life
[1:05:06] and that's what the Lord does.
[1:05:08] He comes and changes us from those
[1:05:11] things which are evil.
[1:05:15] So now when we receive the word of God,
[1:05:18] let us keep on drinking.
[1:05:22] Praise the name of our Lord. Drinking
[1:05:25] and then your change keeps on coming.
[1:05:29] You used to do this, you no longer do
[1:05:31] that. You used to like doing this funny
[1:05:33] thing, you no longer do that.
[1:05:36] You used to hate people, you no longer
[1:05:38] hate people.
[1:05:40] You used to despise others, you no
[1:05:42] longer despise others.
[1:05:44] If somebody does you something wrong,
[1:05:46] you want to return wrong to them.
[1:05:50] But then when you keep on drinking,
[1:05:53] the spirit of life keeps on releasing
[1:05:56] his life in you.
[1:06:00] until you become the manifestation
[1:06:05] what the Lord himself says.
[1:06:08] The Bible says written epistles,
[1:06:12] the word is inside you. The word is in
[1:06:15] your heart and that word in your heart
[1:06:18] is manifested outside by your words,
[1:06:23] by your actions,
[1:06:25] by your conduct,
[1:06:28] by everything about your life.
[1:06:32] Praise the name of the Lord. Now in 1
[1:06:34] Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9
[1:06:40] he says know ye not that the unrighteous
[1:06:43] shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[1:06:56] Be not deceived, neither fornicators,
[1:06:59] neither nor idolators, nor are
[1:07:01] adulterers, nor are effeate, nor are
[1:07:04] abusers of themselves with mankind.
[1:07:26] He says, "All those categories
[1:07:30] shall not inherit the kingdom of God,
[1:07:35] nor are thieves,
[1:07:37] nor are covetous,
[1:07:40] nor are drunkards,
[1:07:43] nor are revilers,
[1:07:47] nor extortioners
[1:07:51] shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[1:07:56] Now the Holy Spirit,
[1:07:59] the spirit of life
[1:08:01] at the beginning
[1:08:04] gets us in those kind of condition.
[1:08:07] Get you a drunkard.
[1:08:10] Get you a fornicator.
[1:08:13] Get you an idolator.
[1:08:16] Get you are abusers of mankind.
[1:08:24] Get you a thief.
[1:08:27] Get you a drunkard. You even don't know
[1:08:29] where to go.
[1:08:36] You know that's your song.
[1:08:40] Then when it comes the neighbors, you
[1:08:41] are busy breaking people's homes.
[1:08:49] Like there's a man, I think,
[1:08:53] had four women at home,
[1:08:56] but they killed him at the neighbor's
[1:08:58] wife.
[1:09:02] bound.
[1:09:05] The Holy Ghost gets you in those kind of
[1:09:07] situations.
[1:09:10] Then the Bible says verse 11,
[1:09:14] and such
[1:09:18] were like them.
[1:09:21] Praise the name of the Lord. Some of us
[1:09:25] and such were some of you.
[1:09:30] So what has happened now?
[1:09:34] You are washed.
[1:09:37] Praise the name of our Lord. You are
[1:09:40] sanctified.
[1:09:42] You are justified
[1:09:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:09:47] And by the spirit of our Lord.
[1:09:51] So now the Holy Spirit
[1:09:54] takes you from a very wicked condition.
[1:09:58] When he gets you in wickedness,
[1:10:01] when he gets you in wickedness,
[1:10:04] he convicts you.
[1:10:07] And when you are convicted
[1:10:10] and then you say, "Lord, I believe
[1:10:14] I'm a sinner.
[1:10:16] I need to repent of my sins. I need to
[1:10:19] turn from my evil ways."
[1:10:22] If you take the word of God by faith,
[1:10:27] then he counts it for righteousness.
[1:10:30] And because of righteousness,
[1:10:33] the Holy Spirit
[1:10:36] releases his life
[1:10:39] and comes into you and then you say, "I
[1:10:42] want to be baptized."
[1:10:45] And then you are baptized in the water
[1:10:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:10:51] Your sins are remitted.
[1:10:54] You are justified.
[1:10:56] You have a desire in your heart, a
[1:11:00] longing in your heart.
[1:11:02] You know, you are sanctified.
[1:11:05] You are separated from wicked things.
[1:11:09] It's the same Holy Spirit
[1:11:12] who has convicted you in wickedness.
[1:11:15] It's the same Holy Spirit
[1:11:18] that sanctifies you.
[1:11:21] And it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:11:25] that fills you. So what you need to do,
[1:11:29] keep believing,
[1:11:31] keep drinking,
[1:11:33] keep obeying.
[1:11:34] It's the same life.
[1:11:37] The spirit of life
[1:11:40] starts at our conviction.
[1:11:43] And when you are convicted,
[1:11:46] don't go away.
[1:11:48] go there and be converted
[1:11:51] and say Lord I'm the sinner
[1:11:54] when Nathan visited David
[1:11:58] and told him you are the man
[1:12:00] David said in Psalms 51
[1:12:05] and then Psalms chapter 51
[1:12:10] and then in verse 4
[1:12:14] he says
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; against you and you only have I sinned
[1:12:20] and done this evil in your sight. That
[1:12:24] you may be justified
[1:12:27] when you speak and be clear when you
[1:12:30] judge.
[1:12:43] Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of our Lord. So when
[1:12:46] David heard the word,
[1:12:48] he never questioned it. He said, "Lord,
[1:12:52] you are right.
[1:12:54] I am the sinner. I need your
[1:12:56] deliverance.
[1:12:58] Whatever you have spoken is right."
[1:13:02] When you get convicted,
[1:13:04] that should be your confession.
[1:13:06] Lord, I'm the sinner. Lord, I've done so
[1:13:09] many things which are wrong. Lord, I
[1:13:11] need your deliverance. Lord, I need a
[1:13:14] change in my life.
[1:13:16] And then you follow him throughout the
[1:13:18] way.
[1:13:20] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:13:23] we are meant to do things,
[1:13:26] not to urge you.
[1:13:29] Just be obedient
[1:13:32] and then the spirit of life will keep on
[1:13:36] releasing his life.
[1:13:38] And you know the grace of God is this.
[1:13:42] When you hear the truth,
[1:13:45] obey the truth. But if you hear the
[1:13:48] truth and reject the truth,
[1:13:53] you may be harder.
[1:13:59] Let us go to Romans chapter one.
[1:14:02] Praise the name of our Lord. Romans
[1:14:05] chapter one. trying to be conscious of
[1:14:08] time.
[1:14:11] I pray the Lord gives us grace.
[1:14:14] In verse 21,
[1:14:18] Romans chapter 1 verse 21 says, "And
[1:14:20] because that when they knew God, they
[1:14:23] glorified him not as God, neither were
[1:14:27] thankful, but became vain in their
[1:14:29] imaginations, and their foolish heart
[1:14:33] was darkened.
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:54] So you hear the truth. The Bible says
[1:14:58] that if you hear his voice,
[1:15:03] don't harden your heart.
[1:15:06] Because that's an open door for you.
[1:15:10] It means when God speaks about
[1:15:12] something,
[1:15:14] there is a door he has opened for you.
[1:15:17] There is deliverance he has put aside
[1:15:19] for you. There is mercy there waiting
[1:15:22] for you.
[1:15:25] So then you don't reject that
[1:15:27] opportunity.
[1:15:29] You say, "Lord, I am the person. Lord,
[1:15:33] I'm the one who needs deliverance.
[1:15:36] Praise the name of the Lord. And then
[1:15:37] you take that opportunity.
[1:15:40] Why? Because it is the same spirit of
[1:15:42] God,
[1:15:44] the spirit of life
[1:15:48] who is convicting you.
[1:15:51] And when he convicts you, he's telling
[1:15:54] you, I'm here to help you.
[1:15:57] I'm here to release my life to you.
[1:16:00] I'm here to give you the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:04] Praise the name of our Lord. That's how
[1:16:06] the Lord works
[1:16:08] in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[1:16:15] Praise the name of our Lord. And then
[1:16:17] verse 10,
[1:16:21] he says, "And with all deceiveveniveness
[1:16:24] of unrighteousness
[1:16:26] in them that perish, because they
[1:16:30] received not the love of the truth, that
[1:16:33] they might be saved.
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:50] And for this cause God send them strong
[1:16:53] delusion that they should believe a lie.
[1:17:06] that they might be damned who believed
[1:17:09] not the truth, but had pleasure in
[1:17:13] unrighteousness.
[1:17:24] Now, so when the word of God comes,
[1:17:28] he wants to deliver us from
[1:17:29] unrighteousness.
[1:17:32] So when you hear the word, allow the
[1:17:35] word of God
[1:17:38] to convict you
[1:17:40] to turn your heart to start hating those
[1:17:43] things you're doing.
[1:17:47] You hate drinking.
[1:17:50] Sometimes you may not have the ability
[1:17:51] to overcome it.
[1:17:55] But when you say, "I don't like it."
[1:17:58] That's a good step.
[1:18:01] Now, the next step to overcome that I
[1:18:03] don't like it
[1:18:11] is to stop it
[1:18:13] in you. You don't have that power to do
[1:18:15] that.
[1:18:17] So, what you need to do is allow the
[1:18:20] spirit of life
[1:18:22] to speak to you.
[1:18:25] And how does that happen?
[1:18:27] Bring yourself into the presence of the
[1:18:29] word of God.
[1:18:32] And as you hear the word of God,
[1:18:36] praise the name of the Lord. Brother
[1:18:37] Brandham says the preaching of the word
[1:18:42] casts out demons.
[1:18:45] So you present yourself before the word.
[1:18:48] And now when you hear the word, there is
[1:18:51] power of God in the word.
[1:18:54] Even your weaknesses keep on going away.
[1:18:57] So you present yourself where the power
[1:18:59] is being released
[1:19:03] because the word casts out demons
[1:19:06] and the word of God releases the Holy
[1:19:09] Spirit. That's what Jesus says.
[1:19:13] The word that I speak unto you
[1:19:17] is spirit.
[1:19:19] The Holy Spirit and life,
[1:19:23] righteousness,
[1:19:24] turning away from drunkardness,
[1:19:27] turning away from darkness,
[1:19:29] that life comes into you and you start
[1:19:32] hating those kind of things like that
[1:19:35] which doctor have talked about.
[1:19:38] turned away from those wickedness.
[1:19:41] Every one of those evil things,
[1:19:45] even the way they used to sing, the way
[1:19:47] they used to dress, all those things
[1:19:50] were turned away.
[1:19:53] Praise the name of everything was burnt
[1:19:56] up
[1:19:59] because he wanted the newness of life.
[1:20:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:20:06] book of John chapter 8,
[1:20:09] there are some people who came to Christ
[1:20:13] and then they were choosing the woman
[1:20:14] who was caught in adultery.
[1:20:18] And then Jesus told them, "Any of you
[1:20:21] who has never sinned,
[1:20:29] let him be the first one to cast a stone
[1:20:31] at him or at her.
[1:20:35] Now the Bible says
[1:20:39] John 8:7.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; So when they continued asking him, he
[1:20:46] lifted up himself and said unto them,
[1:20:49] "He that is without sin among you, let
[1:20:53] him first cast a stone at her.
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:10] And again he stood down and wrote on the
[1:21:12] ground.
[1:21:17] And they that had it being convicted by
[1:21:21] their own conscience went out one by
[1:21:26] one, beginning at the eldest, even unto
[1:21:29] the last. And Jesus was left alone and
[1:21:32] the woman standing in the midst.
[1:21:39] [Music]
[1:21:53] Praise the name of the Lord. The Bible
[1:21:55] says the word of God is a two-edged
[1:21:59] sword.
[1:22:01] It cuts and goes into the marrow, the
[1:22:04] heart, the soul.
[1:22:09] And that's the word he spoke
[1:22:13] for them. They were looking at the
[1:22:14] outside
[1:22:16] and choosing the woman caught in a
[1:22:17] doubt.
[1:22:19] But now the word came from Christ
[1:22:22] and discern their thoughts.
[1:22:25] It went and started picking up whatever
[1:22:27] evil would have been doing in secret.
[1:22:32] And now when the word reached the center
[1:22:35] of their life
[1:22:38] in their soul, the Bible says they were
[1:22:41] convicted.
[1:22:43] Now look what this man self righteous
[1:22:49] brought the woman caught in adultery.
[1:22:51] She's killing our town. She's so evil.
[1:22:56] We need to stone her
[1:22:59] and then they put her before Christ and
[1:23:02] then they were surrounding Christ and
[1:23:04] Christ just sent the word.
[1:23:08] It had enough power,
[1:23:14] but the word
[1:23:16] too sharp.
[1:23:19] Like Steven,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; he spoke to them the word. The Bible
[1:23:24] says cut their hearts.
[1:23:28] Now we can't hear anymore.
[1:23:30] They pulled him outside of the seat and
[1:23:32] started stoning him to death.
[1:23:36] And now these men The word convicted
[1:23:39] them
[1:23:40] and they repent.
[1:23:43] No,
[1:23:45] just went away. But yet they were
[1:23:48] standing before the sacrifice himself.
[1:23:52] So now if the word convicts us
[1:23:56] don't go like those people but say Lord
[1:24:01] be like David.
[1:24:03] Lord what you have spoken is correct.
[1:24:06] Lord change me.
[1:24:07] remit my sins deliver me from this
[1:24:10] weakness. And that's how the spirit of
[1:24:13] life
[1:24:14] comes and takes over your life.
[1:24:17] Praise the name of our Lord. You just
[1:24:19] yield to the Lord.
[1:24:22] Say, "Lord, this is the condition I'm
[1:24:24] in." And then you are sincere before
[1:24:26] God. You tell God all your condition.
[1:24:31] You tell God all your situation.
[1:24:34] Lord, I have a lot of evil thoughts.
[1:24:38] Lord, I do many funny things.
[1:24:41] Lord, deliver me from this kind of
[1:24:43] condition. And then you are allowing the
[1:24:45] spirit of God
[1:24:48] to come and take charge over that
[1:24:50] situation.
[1:24:53] Praise the name of our Lord. So the Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit,
[1:24:57] the spirit of life,
[1:24:59] the more we yield to the word of God,
[1:25:03] the more he releases his life in us.
[1:25:07] And then you find that you are no longer
[1:25:09] yourself doing the things.
[1:25:13] But you know God is transforming you.
[1:25:18] God is changing you.
[1:25:21] Now in the message show us the father.
[1:25:24] says, "Now that little orange tree,
[1:25:29] when you plant it out,
[1:25:32] maybe when you get it,
[1:25:36] you plant it
[1:25:38] now, that's all you have to do."
[1:25:42] You don't have to go and say,
[1:25:45] "Now I've got me some oranges
[1:25:49] somewhere and go to dumping it into it.
[1:25:54] The oranges is already in it.
[1:26:00] The only thing that the little tree has
[1:26:02] to do,
[1:26:07] you have to keep plenty of water on it.
[1:26:12] And when and then the only thing the
[1:26:14] tree has to do
[1:26:18] is drink.
[1:26:20] And it drinks
[1:26:22] and drinks till it drinks over its
[1:26:25] amount.
[1:26:29] And as it drinks,
[1:26:31] it pushes out the limbs.
[1:26:37] And it drinks more.
[1:26:40] It pushes out the leaves.
[1:26:43] It drinks more. It pushes out the
[1:26:46] blossoms.
[1:26:50] And it drinks more, pushes out the
[1:26:53] oranges,
[1:26:56] drink.
[1:26:58] And push
[1:27:01] push. And that's you.
[1:27:05] Praise the name of our Lord. You get it?
[1:27:07] How that life works in us?
[1:27:10] Keep on drinking. Like I remember there
[1:27:13] is last season,
[1:27:16] you know, it rained
[1:27:18] And then people's maze was almost
[1:27:20] flowering there.
[1:27:24] It stopped raining
[1:27:27] and people didn't get much yield because
[1:27:31] there was no rain.
[1:27:33] Now to us
[1:27:35] the rain is always available.
[1:27:38] The Holy Spirit is always available.
[1:27:41] The word is of God is always available.
[1:27:44] It is due now to drink.
[1:27:47] Why would you want to drink
[1:27:50] and then you just stop at justification?
[1:27:53] Why don't you drink
[1:27:55] and continue drinking?
[1:27:58] Get into sanctification.
[1:28:00] Continue drinking. Get into the baptism
[1:28:03] of the Holy Ghost. Continue drinking and
[1:28:07] get into becoming bearing the fruit of
[1:28:10] the spirit.
[1:28:12] So it is us
[1:28:15] to keep on drinking.
[1:28:18] Praise the name of our Lord. Our time is
[1:28:20] getting late.
[1:28:22] Now let us go and read in this message.
[1:28:25] Brother Galatians chapter 5
[1:28:30] what the spirit does.
[1:28:33] In Galatians 5:22,
[1:28:39] it says, "But the fruit of the spirit is
[1:28:42] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:28:47] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:28:51] temperance. Against such there is no
[1:28:54] law.
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] Praise the name of our Lord. So when you
[1:29:10] keep on drinking,
[1:29:13] you must be able to manifest the life of
[1:29:15] the spirit.
[1:29:19] And the life of the spirit
[1:29:22] is manifested by the fruit of the
[1:29:24] spirit.
[1:29:27] And the fruit of the spirit
[1:29:30] is love,
[1:29:32] joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:29:36] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:29:42] temperance, and then he says, "Against
[1:29:45] such
[1:29:47] there is no law."
[1:29:49] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:29:51] message as I finish,
[1:29:54] what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:29:57] He says, "Now the spirit of God
[1:30:01] worked under justification under loser,
[1:30:08] sanctification under Wesley,
[1:30:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[1:30:14] Pentecost,
[1:30:18] and there it is in the last day
[1:30:20] performing and doing the very same
[1:30:22] things.
[1:30:28] what it did in Christ.
[1:30:32] The church and Christ has become one.
[1:30:36] And as they connect together,
[1:30:40] the last link
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; she will go through the sky shouting
[1:30:46] again
[1:30:49] up will come Wesley Luther and all the
[1:30:52] rest of them back in those days.
[1:30:57] We are at the end time. That's what the
[1:31:00] Holy Ghost does.
[1:31:03] The Holy Ghost by justification,
[1:31:07] just a little shadow of it.
[1:31:11] The Holy Ghost by sanctification,
[1:31:15] a little deeper shadow of it.
[1:31:21] The Holy Ghost by the baptism of it,
[1:31:26] a deeper shadow.
[1:31:30] Now, the Holy Ghost
[1:31:33] by the restoration of its very person
[1:31:35] being in here
[1:31:41] forming signs and wonders
[1:31:45] like he did at the beginning.
[1:31:49] Praise the name of our Lord. The spirit
[1:31:51] of life.
[1:31:53] Allow the spirit of life to continue to
[1:31:57] work upon your life.
[1:31:59] then you'll become the manifestation of
[1:32:01] God.
[1:32:04] That's the desire of God. That's the
[1:32:07] harvest.
[1:32:10] You know, when you harvest,
[1:32:12] you don't harvest leaves.
[1:32:16] You don't harvest the back.
[1:32:20] You come to harvest the fruit.
[1:32:24] And that's why we have the message of
[1:32:26] the hour
[1:32:28] that the word we have received
[1:32:30] becomes a living reality in us.
[1:32:34] At the end of the day,
[1:32:37] we are going to be raptured.
[1:32:39] Praise the name of our Lord. We are
[1:32:41] going to strike our full adoption
[1:32:47] which is the change of our bodies where
[1:32:50] these bodies can no longer fall sick.
[1:32:53] where these bodies can no longer die,
[1:32:56] where these bodies can no longer grow
[1:32:58] old,
[1:33:00] we we shall have the glorified body of
[1:33:02] the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:33:05] the incense of God,
[1:33:08] giving us the spirit of life
[1:33:11] that death,
[1:33:13] the way the scripture says, where is
[1:33:15] your sting,
[1:33:18] grave, where is your victory?
[1:33:20] Praise the name of our Lord. So that's
[1:33:23] what lays before us. Allow the spirit of
[1:33:26] life to take full charge over your life
[1:33:31] and then to make you to be like the Lord
[1:33:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:35] Amen. May God bless you so much.
[1:33:38] Amen. Amen. So on Friday
[1:33:43] I would request if we all of us can be
[1:33:45] at brother simp
[1:33:51] from 3:00
[1:33:54] because there will be an afternoon
[1:33:55] service preached by brother Franklin
[1:34:00] to go and stand with those brothers in
[1:34:02] Kacha.
[1:34:05] Then on Sunday
[1:34:07] we have two services here.
[1:34:11] Invite your friends also to be part of
[1:34:13] the services
[1:34:16] and God willing in the afternoon service
[1:34:20] we shall have a prayer line.
[1:34:23] Praise the name of our lord. So I also
[1:34:25] call upon your contributions
[1:34:29] to brother Peter
[1:34:31] since we just want to have a meal
[1:34:33] together with even other visitors.
[1:34:37] Praise the name of the lord. Let us
[1:34:39] stand up and sing a song and each of us
[1:34:40] can speak to the Lord.
[1:34:43] God bless you.
[1:34:53] There is a river of life flowing out of
[1:34:58] me.
[1:35:01] Makes the lame to walk and the blind to
[1:35:06] see.
[1:35:09] Opens prisons doors. Sets the captives
[1:35:15] free.
[1:35:17] There is a river of love flowing out of
[1:35:23] me.
