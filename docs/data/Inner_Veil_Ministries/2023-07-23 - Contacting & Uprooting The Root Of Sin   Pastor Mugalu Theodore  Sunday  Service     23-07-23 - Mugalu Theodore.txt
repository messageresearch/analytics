my precious brother eval for allowing me to speak uh yes I'm going to speak exactly the message that brother Branham gave us on how to approach the Lord Jesus after creating us he sent his seed I was his seat so he sent that seed in this flesh Johnny kazaliwa that's how I was born of my father and my mother here on Earth yes but there is the seed of Jesus in my soul now that seed of Jesus it must meet the rain and the Sunshine of the message of our time [Music] without the message the seed of eternal life cannot germinate [Music] that's the reason I really thank God to for having granted me the grace to believe the message of the hour to Tanzania psalm we shall Begin by reading the book of Psalms the title of our sermon today me contacting and uprooting the root of sin the title of our sermon today is contacting and uprooting the roots of sin in the soul to tanzanite we are reading in the Book of Psalms chapter 139 let's begin from verse 13. tattoo Psalms 139 we are reading verse 13. it says for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for um fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in sacred and curiously wrote in the lowest parts of the Earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them amen amen a loving almighty God you wrote each promise of every day of my life in my soul when I was born now today we pray that the rain and the Sunshine of the message that it may come and water that seeds so that it can germinates it may build a body like yours Jesus we shall be very grateful away when you will build a body that looks like yoursema because you say that being seek you fast the kingdom of God and the rest shall be added down to you we are now seeking the kingdom of God we wish that by the end of this service may you multiply to us the Earthly things may you answer the needs May those who are sick receive the healing problems May every problem find the solution in the name of Jesus amen amen God bless you we may be seated we are beginning from the time when you are born yes as when we were born Jesus had already a program in our soul a program having all the promises for each and every day so you there is a promise pertaining today and also the rain and sunshine to cause the germination of the seed of the promise of this day now God promised it and planned it that it should come through my my mouth there is nothing that is happening just as a new thing you may you may be surprised to see me here today but to God is not even surprised it is something that he already planned before the foundation of the world that is the reason the Bible says that is in Romans chapter 10 verse 17 that faith comes by hearing [Music] and by hearing the word from Christ [Music] the faith comes by hearing the word which comes from the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ the spokesperson of Christ is the prophet that is the reason we believed the message of the prophets now brother Branham says that his message his message comes from Calvary siku yes that day when the Lord Jesus Christ said it is all finished that is the day that he allowed he allotted the message of each age he chose the mouthpiece that he will use to speak that message in each age that is in the New Testament now even our time today yesu there is a mouthpiece of Jesus which are supposed to give us words to give us the faith now that mouthpiece is is a William Marion Brown now and this is how he says Revelation let's read in the Book of Revelation foreign message to so many revelation let's read that message how do we approach God how how do we approach God yeah okay foreign so in Romans chapter 10 verse 17. so in the message revelation chapter 4 part 3 it is 610108 paragraph 203 30 B says how do we approach God Faith cometh by hearing now after you are born there is you have promises in your soul that one means you have the seed of eternal life in your soul that is the seed which will it is that seed which will approach Jesus now you came here today everyone came here with a seed of eternal life in him in your soul so it must the word which brings Faith which is the word of Christ it must enter in you through the years then it lands in your soul where are those promises are written is each one let that word not only remain in your head in your head there are no promises of God the seed of eternal life is only in your soul now when the word proceedeth from the mouth of Christ Amina how do we approach God faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God that is being reflected from the holiest of holies into the messenger of the age how do we approach God faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God that is being reflected from the holiest of holies into the messenger of the age that is how it is and that is exactly what I would wish to read to you I cannot come here and speak my own words or maybe I just come here and read the Bible and then I begin interpreting it in my own understanding apana not really the Bible has been revealed to the messenger of our age it is like [Music] the power lines that is the power of eternal life now it will connect to your soul [Music] then it will emit that seed of eternal life [Music] foreign to show me or Kwanzaa um Christ is revealed in his own word Christ is revealed in his own word for me I don't know English God bless you so much okay so much God puts in your soul the seed of eternal life now that seed of eternal life in you ecosawa Village SIM card it is like the SIM card ikoni telephone it is like a phone which God puts in you now that phone in a position it is supposed to contact the word of faith Amina [Music] it detects the pictures of everybody that you speak and every act that you do your sim card that SIM card in a recording it is recording everything if there is anything which is not the message after the preachings you follow me up and give me the scripture of Matthew chapter 18 verse 15. so that I may be able to repent when I repent the blood of Jesus it will come and a rest of that dot without repenting that seed will remain on the SIM cards I cannot be ruptured without repenting 6508-22m when you are born God sets a record on paragraph 64. it didn't make put a record on it don't make much noise for a little while you know that is the little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and when that life ends yes now that SIM card of eternal life highways record it cannot begin recording when a child has not yet made seven years because at that age that child is not accountable for sin that child is just like Adam was before sin came in that's the reason when a young child dies before making the age of seven years that child will go to heaven because there is no city that was recorded against that child Amina come and sit come on Zambian that the roots of sin in you cannot allow the seed of eternal life to germinate okay Amina when you are born God sets a record on it don't make put a record on it don't make much noise for a little while you know that is the little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and when that life ends the record or tape is took off and laid in the great big library of God now how are you going to get around it at the Judgment bar it is played right back in front of you every move you met every thought that went through your mind can you see that now you can see where God bless you so much that is to say that everything whether it is a good deed it is recorded when it is recorded now if you have a record of only evils those ones are the roots of Saturn uh foreign the invisible unionist of the bride of Christ 65 11 25. brother Branham says that when I'm preaching for you who are listening you are recording you are recording my preachings on your sim card we're gonna record them and God also is recording in heaven and his recording in my soul so it's not just this brother who is recording as I'm preaching record even the SIM card in me of eternal life is also recording even the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven is also recording remember there is a recording making of this not only on this step but God is great record each one of you every move when you bow your head you bow your heart what thoughts goes through your mind remember it is being recorded right now in glory and the record is going to be played on the day of judgment where is your decision oh how you will want it changed at that day now take a stand right now Leo today of repenting of your sins so that the roots of sin in you may be uprooted without uprooting the roots of sin you will not be raptured because with the roots of sin you are connected to Satan now brother brandonishi he says now I want to show you come back that whatsoever that has been recorded it is to make sure that whatever that has been recorded is the root of eternal life or if it is maybe the roots of Saturn that is how he came to make some two drawings of circles [Music] and then the first Circle that he drew on the board he said it was uh like the soul of someone who is sinful and then he made another Circle and that was that one he explained and said it is like the soul of someone who has received the holy spirit let us read 64.0802 the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride let me take this board just a minute I mean okay brother Branham draws illustration on the chalkboard now here is a human heart now I'm not I'm a long ways from being an artist here is a human heart and here is a human heart now this one over here has a snake in it that is the scene here he has his life the one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life well this one here he has malice hatred envy that that is what is causing it is this fellow here well now we have that kind of those characters in US characters of of of of of of losing temper how is you cannot lose Temper Temper or anger is a seed it is like poison of a snake or what we call Venus Temper Temper that one is poison of the snake deception even telling lies that one is the poison of the snake that's that that lying lifestyle that one is is that poison of the snake how is it there is no way you are going to last after a woman who is not your wife has not injected in you with the Venom of adultery Neo it is that Venom akonda it is in you come on when he injects in you that poison of adultery and then it it enters in your blood and then it comes into your eyes now your eyes they love to last or look at women just a Bible that's the reason in Matthew chapter 27 and 28. God says [Music] that he who looks at a woman and lasts after her that last thing it is the Venom of the snake amazing that person has already committed adultery with that woman that is just the fruit of the sin which that man is eating but he has already sinned in his Minds that is the reason a woman you are not just supposed to dress anyhowly you should recover your body very well because if you don't cover your body very well the Venom or poison of the snake in you it is like electricity so that poison is in the woman magnet it is just like a magnet now when I now you also now even though the man also has the seed of Saturn in him we are born with the two seeds we have the seed of eternal life and we also have the seed of the snake we have those two seeds now a woman he's going to push through the specs of the magnet of adultery how through the way she dresses or maybe the way she's walking you will find she's putting on the shoes the Socrates and then it's modeling like that so she's pushing those demons in you [Applause] [Music] for you to visit your brother and then your brother is not there at home and now the wife tells you that my husband is not around and then you say sister you first bring for me water hey I'm feeling a lot of thirsties you bring for me some water system but your brother is not there at home so now they give you the water you take the water now then you say let me rest a little while what are you surely looking for my brother um until when the sister Begins mingling the posture now if it happens that a maybe let's say a cup has dropped utang are you going to look at the sisters she's speaking that is why brother Branham he could not have a conversation with a lady unless that lady came with the husband because Jesus said Maria that to that Samaritan woman when Jesus told the Samaritan woman to give her to give him the water and then Jesus tells her before giving me the word you come with your husband God bless you so much now one of in one of these people one one Soul has the Holy Spirit another one is full of the snake now when you are asked all you are forgiven of your sins you are you have only done this second when you are baptized the serpent that snake is still in your soul you are just repenting of the fruits of the scene but now the roots of that of those things is still there in your soul Amina but the thing that made you do it is still there that is the all the root of evil it is that all root of Saturn is which was making you to commit the evil things notice Amina now when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sins you have only done this taken away that but the thing that made you do it is still there that is the old root of evil it is still there notice then you repent and you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgive you of your sins notice then secondly he comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right taken away sanctification is a compounded Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service that is cleaning the roots of sin then the next comes the baptism of the fire and the holy ghosts now the fire of eternal life must come and burn the roots of sins after burning the roots of sage is when the Holy Spirit can come and dwell in you later that is what will happen when that one happens then we shall have the Rapture then we shall have the wedding supper of the Bride yes then we shall come here with Christ so that he may take on the Dominion or rulership of David [Music] that he may be the son of David we shall come here with him to take one that fire will be burned that the aspect of time it will burn the aspect of time now Saturn with his demons they hide in the aspect of time to touch so we shall burn the issue of times that is how it is with the baptism of fires because first of all the world was at first baptized during the time of the floods of Noah that is how it is the same as the baptism this world here was baptized it was then baptized with the fire will then be baptized with the fire the day since you were Prince the day when with the prince and the princess of the king of kings after the wedding supper of the Bride now we shall descend here with fire and then we shall baptize this first of all he cuts down the trees that is just like the baptism of water so this this this Farm which is the world is supposed to be baptized with the fire attack now he's going to Amina so after the farmer clearing the vegetation then he burns now after burning with the fire attack now he's going to say okay the the maze that planting and the German is only after clearing the farm with fire Jose that is the reason on the day of pentecosts [Music] that is Acts chapter 2 from verse one to five let's read it [Music] foreign [Music] was fully calm they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing might wind fire came down and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing my twin and it filled all the house where they were sitting 20 and there appeared unto them clothing tanks like as on fire and it is sat upon each of them in which we shall descend with Jesus as The Offspring of David to ban the aspect of time where demons and Saturn hides that is the same Pillar of Fire that should come in use as it was on the day of Pentecost to burn all the roots on the day of Pentecost to burn all the roots of sin in you so that you may receive the Holy Spirit then the next comes the baptism of the fire e and the holy ghost that God might dwell in US and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that is in US Ezekiel let's read in Ezekiel now this this court here is in the Book of Ezekiel process the whole process is in the Book of Ezekiel that is chapter 36 verse 25 let us read it Ezekiel chapter 36 25 okay then we lie sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean now that is the baptism of water when they from from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart of Amina and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh he's going to give you a new spirit after the after the water baptism that a new spirit it is the dove which descended that day when Jesus was baptized so it took our lord Jesus in Into the Wilderness that is the very one that is being quoted here and new Spirits which will take you Into the Wilderness that is some new spirit took the apostles into the upper room Dr Jesus there is where you find Dr Jesus foreign [Music] it is inside the hearts it has four chambers they are small they are small Chambers the ones we call the Oregon then we have some two big Chambers the one we call the ventricles in the middle of these two small Chambers there is a small vacuum when it's now that small vacuum is called bottle if you happen to check on the internet now in that small vacuum which is called the body before a child is born the blood of the mother is circulating in the young kids it circulates from the light from the left to the right to nourish the child with nutrients now the child eats from the food which the mother acts so it is assimilated in the blood of the child through that small vacuum of police so then it feeds it Amina it now feeds the body of the child now the food the digested food of the mouth it is that they are nutrients which give life that is subject to death now as the mother is eating maybe she's eating the fish because it is the foods of Life subject to death first of all the fish itself Must Die Kisha kuffa after the fish after roasting or frying that fish when that fish is already dead he's going to bite the fish and chew it in effect so that it should surely die and then it moves to the stomach of the mother who called chloric acid there is hydrochloric acid in your stomach so it continues burning that seed more today at the end of it we have very small particles of nutrients to feed the body of the child God bless you so much now when a child is born in that small vacuum which we are calling that is where the soul dwells now the soul is a part of God so it is coming to sit in that small Hall which we are calling bottle mama so when the mother is giving birth pushing the body out now God is also pushing the soul into the heart that's the reason why it is really very hard to just push out we immediately the child is out and then the Soul enters in the heart then the child can cry yeah yeah now it is going to live the hearts then you die then people say oh he's dying because the soul is getting out of the heart God bless you so much now that's soul brother it is in that small hole in your heart now let's read the message um the United the unity of one God in the one Church 58 12 21 8 64. there is a little room there is a little room a little place where there is not even a cell a little compartment in the human hearts it isn't in the animal or no other life these other animals do not they do not have a soul that's the reason we can slaughter them and we eat the meat Uganda I mean I mean I'm told some animals are not allowed to be floated in Uganda because it is we should respect the law of the land but we can really Slaughter that animal and then because the animal does not have a soul but we cannot eat the meat of a human being because a human being now that soul is a part of God in Congo there are some carnivore people who eat you that is a terrible scene Amina 20 but in the human hearts there is a little place and they are never could come to conclusion what it was but finally they said it is the place where the soul dwells you see that little part compartment in a man's heart God made that in there for himself that is his control room he sets there to control you ah Amina now the soul is where God dwells that is that is why the sin of eternal life is in the soul now [Music] that sin of eternal life is God himself that is where he comes and then he he builds that place Daniel row inside your your heart so that he may come by himself and dwell in that soul that is the what we call baptism of the Holy Spirit it is God himself coming to dwell in your soul that's all right God puts that soul in the heart the day when you are born twenty control control room that is his control room he sets there to control you ah that is his place that is where he sends his messages from the control room the message control room God sends his messages in the control room not in your head going to school and technology that maybe you are going to school or studying to know God the School of Theology you just started when you wake up when you wake up Amina that soul is asleep now how are you going to meet God that is the reason those prayers at night they are really very important when you at night that is the time when so the body becomes tired why is the body getting tired because life has left the body now even if the ears are wide open they are no longer hearing anything because the life has left the body even if you are still focusing with your eyes you are no longer seeing anything I remember one time I was with my wife she was briefing me about our son who was really rebellious then she was explaining now when the child the child reached there and did this now for me I began I began I began kind of Amina I was dozing so I was telling her yeah yeah yeah yeah then she continued saying understand did this no then me I was saying yeah my husband are you really listening to me you're already sleeping I'm just you are listening then she tasked me my husband what have I said football in India I said I I heard you saying when someone is scoring I was now telling my wife us about the dreams then she said you see my husband you were not hearing I said my wife this is because when you are sleeping the five senses they are no longer working all the five senses are inactive by that time I mean now they're super sense it is the one that is working by that time that is the reason mystery when they came from Egypt it was at me nights it was Amina it was at 2 am at night that is the time when God came down that was the time when the faith of Moses would work the faith of Moses that is the faith which pulled God down and then he came down Musa because of the soul of Moses then God himself began doing his works then he began fighting in Egypt now even away Google uh we should also learn from that or emulate we should also emulate or learn from the way Moses to invite God himself into our souls and then God May fight our battles God bless you so much George Washington that was done by George Washington Amina he used the soul Amina there were enemies the other side of Delaware now for them they were these other side then he prayed to God throughout the night so God came down in that just like he came down on the register and then he took his soul the life I can feature Daniel Crystal so he hid that life in Christ all in the morning when the battle started they shot John Washington are around three bullets even the bullets went through the court that he was putting the bullet horse decide three of them decide three of them the other side but when they looked at his body it was not touched by the bullets for them to kill to kill him they fasted to kill the life in him but he no longer had life in his body God bless you so much even one bullet went through Escape it went through this side and came from the other side when he removed if you look at his head there was nothing like a bullet that if that one real that thing for real it happened even it also happened it also happened with Daniel Daniel was casting The Den of Lions but he was covered he was covered [Applause] [Applause] let us seek for baptism of the holy spirit so that we may begin using the pillar of Fire And by you receiving the Holy Spirit first of all you must approach the roots of sin the only room of control urisema uh paragraph 71 [Music] um ezima [Music] Sabina moja you see that little part compartments in a man's heart Daniels God made that in there for himself that is his control room he sits there to control you that is his place your control now that control room it begins controlling the desire for sin when a preacher says that's a you sisters don't just address anyhowly in ability control room that those words must first of all enter into the control room when it enters when those words the lady will begin respecting herself but to be Father's words enter into the controls the woman will hear those the sister will hear those words as if it is just noise that the pastor is making for her these issues of taking warrants the word of God is supposed to enter into your control room if the word has not entered in the control room you will begin taking words because the word of God has not yet entered in the control room you are doing the evils in secrecy but when you accept your controlling that you may be under the control of the word of God now that word of God builds a body of eternal life it is supposed to build up the body of God um okay so my young Billy how can we work with you how can he work with you when the nature of the spirit of the devil is in there if you still have the roots of sin in you God cannot use you when they may not and every man born on Earth is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Lies We are born with the roots of sin in us so in that Kano academic nature how can a man achieve anything only by through his intellectuals but when he comes to be a new creature and the old man has passed out and the new man Christ takes his throne in the human heart then life looks different he starts on a new Road from his own selfish motives till the big ideas to make himself something big he starts right towards Calvary to recognize God then is all his objectives his motive his achievement and all that he is lays in the glory of the Cross where Christ paid the price for human life Christ is our life let's repeat these words faith comes by hearing electricity it is like the electricity of eternal life when it enters through the years is part of the five senses so it should descend up to inside the soul EJ so that it comes and then it makes the seed of eternal life to germinate now for that seed of eternal life to germinate the roots of eternal life must be uprooted when I'm preaching my voice proceeds foreign [Music] it goes to the dwelling place of God where you have your apartment or room there now when your soul enters in your room that is that is where your soul receives that word from kupiteria telephone through the telephone now your soul it hears from there is now when it brings to you this message inside your soul now is it is there that's the soul that is where the soul of the Samaritan when that Soul received the message she left whatsoever she was doing she left it a kind of thing so she first went to put right her life now that is how it should be even with you let now before going to that person first come here Mimi me myself come here and speak it to God and tell him I have some differences or enemies

some of us here they just commit adultery fornication so today let it be the last day you come here at the altar and repent yes so that Jesus may approach that root of of sin when you leave your seats as you are moving approach as you are heading to the palpit God in heaven stands like the way he stood the day when they took this baby Moses into River Nile when his father when he reached near the Waters of river Niles then he begins praying before dumping the child into the water God is stood in Heavens and then he ordered all the angels look down there on Earth there is a person who is believing in me he wants to leave his child his son in the water go and look after Himachal we cannot live that child protected without protecting that child Gabrielle Gabriel Pikachu can you sound the trumpet gather Ten Thousand Angels Ten Thousand Angels when you leave your seat come into the altar to repent God stands up and he gathers Ten Thousand Angels so that they can escort you and God says [Music] so that even more he also prayed that kind of prayers and he sent the angel of God Malaika elfukumi Ten Thousand Angels and then they filled the the soul of king ahasweras so even the King was troubled the whole night so that I may give him blessings God bless you so much that is the same way me your brother experiments I've ever experimented the those issues which Mordecai went

Malachi chapter 3 May you give us one billion may you give us one billion God is for sure going to give you the one billion me like I was I had stolen from God to hundred dollars you seek that day

want a job to be the ambassador of Congo Olympics may you give me a joke to be the ambassador of Congo Tanzania in Tanzania not any other country Tanzania I want to be the ambassador kiswahili where because there is a Swahili radio in Africa that's right that radio it is waves rich in the village where I believed from the message in Congo a quick testimony so that it may be a testimony when the Brethren will hear because in that church they really prophesies that I will sound or I will I will work with the president of Congo um when you give me The Ambassador ambassadorship in Tanzania when they will hear that testimony they will save for surely our God is the Living God salsa now to begin with the president didn't know anything about me now Cena address even I didn't have an address in addressing I I didn't have that the address even the president didn't know but for me I have an address in heaven and for you God you really know me and I want you to give me a job Amina he's our God who can give us jobs the president doesn't know you God but for me I know you see I cannot write to the president later asking for a job if my own son wants to work in my show how is he cannot write a letter requesting for a job from the director in my in my factory he is just going to tell me father I want to serve in the other shop now it is me who is going to call the director and I tell him my son is coming can you give him the joke it is me the boss me I'm the human being for you are God um you tell the president of Congo and itafute so that he may look for me he may look for me Leo today and he may get me today he may invite me in his office today and he may sign an appointment later today not tomorrow communication if it is about tomorrow then God you are not my father I've already fulfilled the way the message says I've already I've already kept I've repented now you give me a token 7 Ezekiel just like it was with with Hezekiah Leo today so after that then it was 10 a.m in the morning journalist one of my friends was a journalist akanita he called me as a professor mugalu and he said Professor mugaluapi where are you waziri wakongo communication the minister in charge of communication in Congo is looking for you ah forever I wasn't excited I said God God I never told you that the minister should look for me I said the President should look for me now how does the president become again the minister foreign [Applause] [Applause] yes the president is looking for him [Applause] [Music] they are now two weeks when I was looking for you so I really am now happy to see you guys I want to give you a job I want to give you a job now that job I only give it to someone whom I really trust me Tanzania and that one is the ambassador of Congo in Tanzania so I remained in a shock I will ask myself am I dreaming or it is a true I prayed to God I don't think something like this can happen for my sake then the president asked me are you refusing the job how much money do you want I may give you so that you accept the job I said no Mr President I'm just wondering how you've come to give me that job not really I will really get my salary from that job okay now I'm appointing you as the Ambassador today and now just exactly the way those are the very words that were coming from his mouth is there some witchcraft which is above that one do we have some witchcraft which is above that one one that is for the men the message of the message he know he was no longer settled in his cities he was again calling the I'm not going to go with some files so he appointed me without even asking how did I style up with you and Elizabeth without even knowing where was I born yesterday but Jesus knew all of that Amina I was appointed Joseph that is the reason right now I'm a retired Ambassador that is the message I will add them to you that is to say that God he told us the day when you were born he put a SIM card in your soul your sim card that SIM card your control room that is the control room your work as as a person is to just approach the roots of sin um by approaching the roots of sin in ability Prophet the message must come from the mouth of the prophets [Music] now for me when I come here I'll just replay repeat that message so that the message where that message may go to where the voice of God that brings faith is now it will come from charcoal into your your room then it is going to push it into your soul that is the reason in the next message he says that all the prophets all the prophets and even the preachers of the New Testament are prophets all the prophets and all the preachers what you are going to preach you look for it from heaven let it come from then it entered uh the impersonation of Christianity impersonation of Christianity foreign the impersonation of Christianity then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world that is the word that I'm preaching it's not just it should not supposed to be just the word that we are just speaking from here it is the exact word that God was to speak the one that he spoke before we were born and now according to his program it was for this day that is the word that I'm supposed to preach to you so Soma then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is that the prophet catches what God has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world he God spoke the word and it is laying way out so stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and sees the time coming the prophet goes up another and then he goes to see the world the word of our time then he comes down and then he preaches it then it he sends it to us don't you ever accept some brethren in this message then for them they say I think brother Branham made an error somewhere to me those people their network has some problems they for surely don't know what is the message the message it is brother Brandon I'm going up in heaven the way God had already spoken it that is what we call the message it is just like Moses Musa Moses he just wrote the way God created him by then what Moses was writing Moses wasn't there Moses was not there the day when God was created but he is explaining he says on the first day God did this because it is because he went up just like our prophets he even went up to the day and even saw how God was created then he began writing it God bless you so much that message had already been he had been spoken before the foundation of the world he went into the Wilderness he even rented a room for three full years that was his upper room he would enter into the upper room and then he will go up to heaven he had a message to the Ephesus then he came down and he wrote to us like the New Testament God bless you so much that is the reason be me me myself before preaching the message that that I also begin preaching my own message here I also begin here my own message it is not before the foundation of the world he was the messenger supposed to be here there is no way we can change that order God bless you so much economy and the layer okay 16. they had a Stony hearts um now Ezekiel now Ezekiel the prophet goes up and sees the day that we are living in Ezekiel went up and saw the time of Jesus Isaiah went up account November ah yes Isaiah went up and so Jesus will be baptized by someone from the Wilderness that was 800 years before the birth of Jesus Isaiah went up acaf so he even went up to the time of the birth of Jesus and he saw akashuka and then he came down and then he wrote it now even John the Baptist he even repeated I mean and they said Amina Mimi he said me whatever they asked him let's read that in John chapter one foreign it says then said they unto him who are thou when in any that we may give an answer to them that sent us what says Thou of thyself he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord I said the prophet Isaiah Isaiah I mean that is to say Isaiah saw him so it became a promise even me as an individual I have that promise the promise of preaching um [Music] to the Nations which are on the Eastern side of Congress I'm also my promises are in Isaiah it is in Isaiah 54. Isaiah 54 chapter verse verse 3 um let us read it for thou shall Break Forth on the right hand and on the left and I said shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited now my second promise is just exactly like that one of Paul [Music] um we read Acts Acts of the Apostles chapter nine Musa 15. but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name for before the Gentiles and the Kings and children of Israel Nations I've ever taken the message to the the president of Congo I was really taking the other message even the way the president of Congo came to look for me he was following my Ministry that preachings via the TV so it was through those preachings that the president saw me and then he said look for me that preacher Amina Isaiah Isaiah Ezekiel 59 now Ezekiel the prophet goes up and sees the day that we are living in oh what a trip up jacobo slada to foresee what will be alibanda he went up using jacobo slada that is that that ladder of Jacob is the very one that Daniel used when they cast him in the den of lions he fall inside in the ladder of Jacob Musa even Moses he was in the ladder in Jacobus ladder the dry land or the path which they used in the Reds that was Jacob Jacob is the hand of God he says he tells them that he tells Moses that Pharaoh will not allow you to just leave the land he will harden his heart and refuse that is the time when I myself I will stretch forth my hand Exodus that is Exodus chapter 3 verse 19. so me let's read it and I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand ah and I will stretch out my hand and I mean I will stretch out my heart that is the hand which God is stretchedu and it was a dry land in the in the Red Sea that is the pillar of fire that is the very pillow Fighters even us we are supposed to use that simple that is the very one that I sent to the president of Congo he was in that in that Pillar of Fire and he was troubled brother now the Brethren went to the police police and the police failed to dress for the cars now brother Branham told the Brethren command our police we have the commander of police in heaven command of a policeman let us send the Heavenly police Commander [Music] Matthew so they took a scripture which was Matthew 18. so as to order the devil yeah he may return back Dhaka by himself do you see the power that we have as Believers to insult me let us read it foreign [Music] [Music] paragraph 89 restoration of the bright tree paragraph 89. restoration of the Bright Tree paragraph 89 restoration restoration of herbra booze huh restoration restoration of the Bright Tree paragraph paragraph 89 oh unaipata restoration of the Bright Tree paragraph 89 88 7 88 paragraph eight eight foreign [Music] 6204 22. 62 0 62 04 22 paragraph eight eight we are supposed to allow the Lord Jesus to enter into our control room control room when he enters in our control room that is the eternal life so we shall use that eternal life command our police like the Chief Inspector of police so that eternal life will go to fight our battles to get from that thief whatever he robbed from us control room because the Lord is in the control room foreign [Music] okay enforce then we are there have the privilege to enforce upon saturnia Bali then have the privilege to enforce upon Saturn the claims that God give us to foreign Jesus just gave the order said they said the devil which was in the storm God bless you so much experience they are Brethren who have used such that experience there is one brother in South Africa the thief entered into his room and they stole whatever they could then he woke up he did not begin making noise he just said yes [Music] when they slap you decide um you turn this other side even take the TV it never took two days the thieves were arrested police he did not take them to police [Music] they arrested they returned every item that they had taken from the house experience we are supposed to experiment that experience that's the message foreign [Music] foreign for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church when God speaks he enters in that word which he has spoken that is why he says in Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 12. he says that I watch over my word so that I may make it to come to pass now inside the word God is inside his word the very one who brought that promise is inside that promise that is why brother he took that very promise that is Matthew chapter Amina for God has a law okay okay for God has a law and his word is a law and the god in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Saturn say give it back and he has to do it remember is that the Holy Spirit go write down on our I mean now Amina Amina go write down on our knees and say it is that such the Lord he he's got to give it up that is all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it let's read 92 of this is in a message as if we are pampering Saturn that you know what Saturn if you feel like if it is your will give it back to me you are supposed to force him rudisha return it back upon it may the sick receive the healing so we got down on our knees see now Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for he was the one now we are not the one the word of the Lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word came to them but Jesus was the one see he didn't have to pray he was God himself see but we are His prophets his servants that is to say that brother Branham is not God hasn't he said it's there he says the Lord Jesus Christ is God for him is our brother let's move on he was God himself see but we are His prophets his servants who the word of the Lord comes to then the prophet is Vindicated by whether it is the word of the Lord or Not by what he says by what he says come to pass let's go to 93 so then we have a scripture here that Jesus said wherever to or more are gathered in my name and if they will agree I will be in their midst that is Matthew 18 19 and 20 Amina and if they will agree on touching anyone certain Amina on touching anyone certain thing and ask it don't doubt it they shall have what they have asked okay let's go to 95 95 araka now we got on our knees about five men with the brother Fred shortman and many of the others was there four or five men and we knelt down and I pleaded this case before God and then I took the word order so now he's now he takes that promise and he says you said when We Gather two or three you will be in our Middle East and we shall be able to send them angels to send the pillar of fire to go and restore back whatever that was stolen and then I took the word or the promise and send it forth the great Holy Spirit as he took the word to serve the summons a vision broke out and I saw a man going towards Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving his truck now that Thief is returning back the Holy Spirit came upon Him condemned him and he turned around about halfway I saw him come back and pack that car on a certain street over across the river here I raised the up and told the Brethren that says the Lord and when they started God bless you so much that is the message we are talking about let us use that message to get the solution to every problem foreign [Music] Amina the seed of the serpent ER super sense sorry super sense two persons the message super sense super sense the message super sense Peter in the prison the message super sense says Peter in

control room which comes from the control room when eternal life comes in you as baptism of the Holy Spirit you are meant to use that eternal life so when you are praying when brother Branham began praying he says you say in math you said it in Matthew 18 19. that when we gather tuna and then we agree on something you are in our midstuma we can send you forth amen now here one year at this point Brethren were in prayers praying over an issue where Peter had been had been taken into prison your experience that was that same experience that brother Branham had learned from it now this Brethren who were praying for Peter their prayers they were sending their prayers into prison and they sent the Holy Spirit to go into the prison may enter inside the prison and he may get out now that is how it's supposed to be with us if we have someone who is sick [Music] even if that sick person is We Shall Gather here we take Matthew 18 19 to 90 million and Nicola then we we tell him we are using your scripture and now we have gathered to keep your wife we have agreed in one Accord what do we mean by Africa it is putting right our lives are you really hearing me it is putting right our lives we want to send the eternal life foreign another one says Muslim may you forgive me my brother another one says I have some differences with my wife this morning as we are here I'm requesting then I will go to repent and I will even repent in the church that is what we call agreeing God bless you so much those who were in the church and while Peter was in prison they first of all began by agreeing that is how brother Branham speaks about it it was the same sixth sense one time that the Apostle Peter was laying in jail and they were going to behead him the next day and down at John Mark's house they had a prayer meeting that 60 cents begin to accumulate around the James prison now the prayers began accumulating in them that 60 cents began to accumulate around the jail where I had been covered by dawa by by prayer that 60 seconds that's 60 cents begin to accumulate around the jail where I had been covered by prayer I mean The Sixth Sense went to work the pillar of fire came in the window and touched Peter and saved come on get out of here The Sixth Sense God bless you so much I wish to stop there the time has really gone [Applause] God bless you let's give the Lord the hand of praise [Applause] I was speaking to brother James that this morning before we knew the brother would be here that I was going to speak on Romans 10 17. um that faith comes by hearing and hearing by

and it was Yes actually receives the waves if there's no SIM card in there that phone will not peek anyway and now faith comes by hearing okay hearing by the word which is the seed of God which is on the inside of you Eric if it's not there it doesn't matter how much they preach there is no SIM card now we've got a terminology praise the Lord so we really appreciate the brother amen amen and I
