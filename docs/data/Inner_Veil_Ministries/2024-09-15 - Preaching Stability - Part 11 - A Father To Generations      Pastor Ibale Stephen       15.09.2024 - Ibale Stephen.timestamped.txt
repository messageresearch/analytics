[1:00:24] e e
[1:01:45] 15 verse
[1:01:48] 45 he says and so it is
[1:01:52] written the first man Adam
[1:01:57] was made a living
[1:02:00] Soul he was made a living
[1:02:05] Soul the last
[1:02:08] Adam was made a quickening
[1:02:13] spirit hallelujah hallelujah meaning the
[1:02:15] first
[1:02:18] man was made a living Soul so he was a
[1:02:23] man of
[1:02:24] flesh but then the second Adam is the
[1:02:28] lifegiving
[1:02:30] spirit which is the Lord Jesus himself
[1:02:34] he to come and bring
[1:02:38] birth of the living
[1:02:40] life on the side of the Bride
[1:02:44] body are you together with me so but
[1:02:48] because the devil so
[1:02:51] e was a s
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:56] amen the enemy
[1:02:59] went and he started teaching
[1:03:02] her amen did God
[1:03:05] say amen and when she started reasoning
[1:03:09] on the
[1:03:10] word the devil was locked in the
[1:03:13] corner and when he was locked in the
[1:03:16] corner then he had to come back
[1:03:19] again it's true you shouldn't eat but
[1:03:24] it's only because
[1:03:27] if you eat you'll become like a
[1:03:30] god you know
[1:03:33] right and wrong and then the woman was
[1:03:39] called and when she allowed the
[1:03:42] wrong to know the
[1:03:45] wrong the wrong in
[1:03:48] itself brought
[1:03:50] death amen it brought death and
[1:03:56] man who was ever
[1:04:00] born to fulfill the
[1:04:03] scripture to
[1:04:06] multiply was born in a failure
[1:04:12] mode he was born in
[1:04:16] sin and the en of
[1:04:19] God has the sin failure
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:23] system amen so God now
[1:04:27] therefore sought to
[1:04:30] turn that which is evil into that which
[1:04:34] is
[1:04:35] perfect and he could only do it by the
[1:04:39] power of the creative spoken
[1:04:45] word thank
[1:04:47] you so
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:50] if use the
[1:04:53] word in the reverse order
[1:04:58] she looked to the
[1:05:01] creation That was supposed to look to
[1:05:06] her are you together with me but she
[1:05:10] turned her
[1:05:12] eyes so she used the word in the
[1:05:18] revers she did not really have that kind
[1:05:22] of confidence
[1:05:25] to realize her
[1:05:28] position that I am above this
[1:05:32] creation and every
[1:05:34] nature must look
[1:05:37] up amen that's what God wants us to do
[1:05:42] you shouldn't look
[1:05:44] down for
[1:05:46] leadership you look up are you together
[1:05:50] with me Christ looks
[1:05:53] up Amen to the father and he says I do
[1:05:57] nothing unless I see my father
[1:06:00] do amen a wife does not look down to a
[1:06:05] child a wife looks up to the
[1:06:08] husband th the order of
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:13] God God Christ husband wife even in
[1:06:20] church you don't look down you look up
[1:06:24] I'm trying to
[1:06:27] the principle of the fatherhood this
[1:06:30] morning amen if if so
[1:06:35] herself in the same power and authority
[1:06:40] Adam she would have not Fallen to the
[1:06:44] serpent because she was above
[1:06:48] that she should have looked
[1:06:52] Adam and Adam looked back to God
[1:06:56] the that have been fall fall comes when
[1:07:00] we use the word in the reverse
[1:07:03] order Amen brother Bram says we are
[1:07:07] living millions of miles below our
[1:07:10] god-given prev
[1:07:34] you know one thing which we should know
[1:07:37] is that we are fell hairs in all rights
[1:07:40] with
[1:07:42] Christ just like Adam and
[1:07:45] Eve were in the same Covenant before the
[1:07:51] fall so we should look to Christ
[1:07:55] all manner of
[1:07:57] life so because in all these things for
[1:08:01] the devil to achieve what he
[1:08:04] wants he has always to use the word in
[1:08:07] the reverse
[1:08:09] order amen so
[1:08:12] sin is the reverse order of
[1:08:17] righteousness and we should never think
[1:08:20] in
[1:08:21] terms of what if I do it this way
[1:08:28] are you together with me God certain
[1:08:32] principles of how everything should
[1:08:36] work but if you come to the
[1:08:40] point where you start saying what if I
[1:08:43] do
[1:08:47] this it also work God doesn't work like
[1:08:52] for everything he has got a principle
[1:08:56] we should never I mean we should always
[1:08:59] insist on a perfect
[1:09:02] will because permissive
[1:09:05] will is never God's perfect
[1:09:08] will so reversing the order of the
[1:09:13] headship WR
[1:09:15] down death into the human
[1:09:19] nature Eve submitted to the role of Adam
[1:09:23] I mean
[1:09:25] submitted the role of
[1:09:28] Adam to the
[1:09:32] serpent are you together with me look
[1:09:36] up let's make
[1:09:39] Mone in our own
[1:09:41] image amen so man should be looking to
[1:09:47] God Amen and when we see looking to the
[1:09:52] Head even in church there comes a
[1:09:57] disorder when we fa look to the order I
[1:10:00] mean to the
[1:10:02] fatherhood Amen in the family everything
[1:10:06] goes
[1:10:07] wrong so he must always look
[1:10:13] upward in that
[1:10:16] fall
[1:10:18] God revealed that he had the
[1:10:22] capacity to restore Human Nature
[1:10:26] by taking into himself the pain of the
[1:10:29] wages of
[1:10:34] sin are you together with
[1:10:38] me he stepped into the
[1:10:41] situation when he took the body of Jesus
[1:10:45] Christ so that he could
[1:10:48] take unto himself the wages of
[1:10:53] sin that you and me
[1:10:58] free amen that's what God
[1:11:03] did he had to swallow the
[1:11:07] pain of
[1:11:09] sin and Resto was
[1:11:12] man after he took man
[1:11:18] sin man his own
[1:11:21] righteousness amen and he restor
[1:11:25] by imputing his own righteousness upon
[1:11:30] him he repairs the damage that was
[1:11:34] caused by
[1:11:37] sin God gradually restor
[1:11:43] man the nature of
[1:11:46] sunship that he had lost in the
[1:11:49] fall are you together with me he restor
[1:11:53] to him that nature
[1:11:55] when he fills him with the Holy
[1:11:58] Ghost and then the Holy Ghost finds a
[1:12:01] sitting place in the
[1:12:04] soul when he sits in the
[1:12:07] soul then you are
[1:12:10] seal to the day of your
[1:12:13] Redemption but yet on a
[1:12:16] day you know walk with
[1:12:20] God you have to deal with other
[1:12:23] conditions
[1:12:25] that attack your human
[1:12:28] spirit amen that's why in the Old
[1:12:32] Testament you find that the sh
[1:12:37] Glory the evidence of the presence of
[1:12:41] God was in the holy of holies all the
[1:12:46] time that was the
[1:12:48] seal upon that
[1:12:51] Tabernacle but the
[1:12:53] priests had
[1:12:56] continue doing daily ministration and
[1:12:59] daily
[1:13:02] sacrifice for the sins that were
[1:13:04] committed by the
[1:13:06] people so if you have fully accepted
[1:13:10] Christ as your personal savior there is
[1:13:14] a seal on the inside of
[1:13:16] you what you are dealing with is the
[1:13:20] daily
[1:13:21] failure in your human spirit
[1:13:25] that causes your body to error but God
[1:13:30] himself is
[1:13:32] determined to restore you to the perfect
[1:13:36] order where he created you by and how
[1:13:40] did you create you he created you by the
[1:13:44] spoken word and he wants to restore you
[1:13:48] the
[1:13:49] spoken that's the work of the
[1:13:53] second amen rest over you upon your face
[1:13:58] add virtue upon your face add knowledge
[1:14:03] upon your first and temp what is God
[1:14:07] doing restoring you into the original
[1:14:12] order by the spoken word so what Eve fa
[1:14:17] I mean Adam failed to
[1:14:19] do Christ has come to do and finally man
[1:14:24] will to the state of a perfect man
[1:14:28] again and that's
[1:14:30] why God hands back the Christian
[1:14:35] man the same principle of
[1:14:38] headship like he had given
[1:14:41] Adam the mind of God he gives man the
[1:14:46] word of God
[1:14:48] again he gives him the Holy Ghost he
[1:14:52] gives him the mind of God again
[1:14:55] in the New Path why does he give you all
[1:14:58] this for because you must
[1:15:03] multiply are you together with me you
[1:15:06] must
[1:15:07] multiply you must give birth you must
[1:15:10] speak the world and when you get one
[1:15:14] brother coming to the truth of the world
[1:15:17] that's
[1:15:21] multiplication that's
[1:15:23] multiplication you are m Ling
[1:15:26] Yourself by Looking Back to the
[1:15:30] principle you cannot
[1:15:33] multiply by looking to the
[1:15:36] organization because that's below you
[1:15:39] you have to look up to the world that's
[1:15:42] where we can get the
[1:15:47] new amen so let's go to the families
[1:15:51] here a little
[1:15:52] bit for the future
[1:15:56] families are bested on the light given
[1:15:59] to the
[1:16:03] father because that's the
[1:16:06] principle the father must have a life
[1:16:11] to because when the children
[1:16:14] come they look up to the
[1:16:17] father so this is what I'm talking about
[1:16:20] today I'm talking about a different type
[1:16:23] of fatherhood
[1:16:26] father to a
[1:16:29] generation not only father to a
[1:16:33] child but when you are a
[1:16:36] man God wants to make you a
[1:16:40] father to a
[1:16:42] generation amen because your
[1:16:48] son when you bring forth your child your
[1:16:52] child will look to you
[1:16:55] Adam looked to should have looked to the
[1:16:58] father you bring forth a son a son will
[1:17:02] look to
[1:17:04] you understand what father
[1:17:10] means amen so even your
[1:17:14] daughter is building into a wife by
[1:17:18] looking to
[1:17:21] you so that's now being mother to a
[1:17:27] generation you have brought up a
[1:17:30] child but the life you are passing over
[1:17:33] to your
[1:17:34] child has got the capacity to bring
[1:17:37] forth another
[1:17:40] life amen th being a
[1:17:44] father to a
[1:17:46] generation but you are destroying your
[1:17:50] daughter because if you are not being
[1:17:53] the kind of a father
[1:17:57] being the kind of
[1:17:59] husband you are sending mixed signals to
[1:18:02] your
[1:18:05] daughter amen you are killing the future
[1:18:09] generation because if you are cruel in
[1:18:12] your
[1:18:13] house your daughter will
[1:18:16] know that this is what men are supposed
[1:18:19] to
[1:18:20] be she will even accept an abusive man
[1:18:25] because she doesn't have an
[1:18:27] interpretation of
[1:18:29] fatherhood she doesn't have an
[1:18:32] interpretation of a
[1:18:34] husband it is very very
[1:18:37] important fatherhood
[1:18:40] in is the stream of life for the
[1:18:46] future are you together with me his
[1:18:50] fatherhood we must make
[1:18:53] sure that God gives us
[1:18:56] Grace that we become a restored
[1:19:00] Adam that we come back into the state of
[1:19:03] the
[1:19:05] perfect amen that we may be
[1:19:09] able take up the challenges of
[1:19:13] Adam because when we are proper standing
[1:19:19] Adam then we are going to help our
[1:19:23] daughters to find the right kind of a
[1:19:26] man praise the Lord amen I tell you heah
[1:19:33] was a very successful
[1:19:36] man in a very successful
[1:19:40] marriage but God was more
[1:19:45] interested in the future
[1:19:51] Generations I didn't hear that amen
[1:19:56] heah was you know these
[1:19:59] days when girls are going to
[1:20:03] marry they sour a man out
[1:20:06] there amen the man sources
[1:20:09] them both
[1:20:13] ways and then she comes and canels the
[1:20:17] mother sometimes
[1:20:24] starts from the mother Mommy Mommy there
[1:20:28] is
[1:20:33] somebody what does
[1:20:43] he that
[1:20:46] one take
[1:20:48] from those ones you don't
[1:20:51] delay just accept and go with who
[1:20:55] go with
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] theowing
[1:21:02] you how can you know
[1:21:08] him the following things you know
[1:21:12] later that's what they look
[1:21:15] for amen but you know here is
[1:21:21] now very successful man
[1:21:25] he's a
[1:21:26] king and then he finds a young
[1:21:30] lady he was in a successful
[1:21:34] marriage and that's good for all of
[1:21:37] you I know that many of you are in very
[1:21:40] successful
[1:21:42] marriages but then God is not looking at
[1:21:47] you when God made
[1:21:50] man he made him with a
[1:21:53] purpose that he
[1:21:56] multiplies hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:21:59] then brother Bram
[1:22:01] says in the message I believe it's
[1:22:05] marriage and
[1:22:08] divorce that when God
[1:22:11] said be fruitful and
[1:22:15] multiply he was not speaking to the
[1:22:17] Natural
[1:22:19] man because the natural man was not made
[1:22:24] yet
[1:22:26] the natural man was made in Genesis
[1:22:30] 2 so he was speaking to a spiritual
[1:22:34] man and then brother Bram says it is a
[1:22:39] spiritual
[1:22:43] multiplication hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:22:46] when you stand with the word as a
[1:22:49] husband and you are training your
[1:22:52] children and the children are coming the
[1:22:55] word of
[1:22:57] God that's the spiritual
[1:23:01] multiplication you are praying a father
[1:23:04] to a
[1:23:07] generation because the children are
[1:23:09] going to pass what they've
[1:23:13] got are you together with me that's the
[1:23:17] multiplication which is spoken about in
[1:23:20] Genesis chapter
[1:23:23] 1 amen
[1:23:25] so
[1:23:26] friends
[1:23:28] Brothers you are supposed to be doing a
[1:23:31] spiritual
[1:23:34] multiplication put down your
[1:23:37] children tell them about your past what
[1:23:41] you used to be and what God has made you
[1:23:46] now let them
[1:23:49] appreciate what the New Birth has made
[1:23:52] out of
[1:23:53] you is spiritual
[1:23:56] multiplication this is being a
[1:23:59] father to a
[1:24:01] generation and then another
[1:24:04] generation praise the Lord amen look at
[1:24:08] this
[1:24:09] ezekiah a very successful
[1:24:12] man and then in Isaiah
[1:24:17] 38 and verse
[1:24:20] one in those days was ezekiah to
[1:24:25] death and isah the prophet the son of
[1:24:29] came unto
[1:24:32] him and said unto him thus says the Lord
[1:24:37] set house in
[1:24:39] order for thou shal
[1:24:42] die and not live now
[1:24:47] Hezekiah was not
[1:24:49] sick because he was a
[1:24:52] sinner he was sick because that's the
[1:24:55] door of
[1:24:57] exit into the dimension of immortal
[1:25:03] life amen you may live in high
[1:25:07] levels like
[1:25:09] heah but I want tell you there is always
[1:25:13] a door of
[1:25:15] exit amen and that door automatically
[1:25:21] opens at a certain spot in life
[1:25:26] so we must live
[1:25:28] alive knowing that we don't know when
[1:25:30] that door is going to
[1:25:33] open so we must prove to be fathers to a
[1:25:39] generation before we are dead before

[2:05:03] redeem
[2:05:04] Israel but look they've not done
[2:05:07] anything I want to go

[2:05:25] testimony she has been able to bring up
[2:05:28] children who have got Muslim
[2:05:32] names but they are
[2:05:35] Christians I think that
[2:05:38] is
[2:05:39] [Applause]
[2:05:41] celebrated I know what she has come
[2:05:45] through
[2:05:47] fathers this is our church
[2:05:52] it should not die
[2:05:54] tomorrow it should
[2:05:59] mtip listen I'm reading this for
[2:06:03] you I write unto you
[2:06:07] fathers because you have known him
[2:06:09] that's from the
[2:06:13] beginning I write unto you young
[2:06:17] men where young
[2:06:19] men also stand up
[2:06:23] young
[2:06:24] men
[2:06:26] good
[2:06:27] Fathers and young
[2:06:29] men I'm going to bring you the principle
[2:06:33] here I write to young
[2:06:35] men because you have over the wicked
[2:06:39] one I write you little
[2:06:44] children because you have
[2:06:47] known the
[2:06:50] father I have written unto you
[2:06:54] fathers because you have known him that
[2:06:56] from the
[2:06:59] beginning I've written unto you young
[2:07:02] men because you are
[2:07:05] strong where are the strong young
[2:07:08] men let the weak
[2:07:10] say I am
[2:07:13] strong amen see I want you to
[2:07:18] understand that the people that John was
[2:07:21] writing
[2:07:23] to as weak as you think you are
[2:07:29] weak John was not looking at these daily
[2:07:33] mistakes you
[2:07:36] make he was looking at the reason why
[2:07:39] you come to this
[2:07:41] church there is something in
[2:07:44] you that brings you before
[2:07:47] God and that is
[2:07:49] strength that's what John is trying to
[2:07:55] build Mighty Army so that you become a
[2:08:00] father of
[2:08:02] generations amen so and the word of God
[2:08:07] Abid in
[2:08:09] you and you have
[2:08:11] overcome the wicked one God bless
[2:08:15] you you may be seated as you
[2:08:18] listen so the concept of John here
[2:08:23] is the emphasis of
[2:08:26] fatherhood which has great binding
[2:08:30] effects on the stability of the
[2:08:33] church
[2:08:35] fathers young men little
[2:08:39] children amen so fathers is the main
[2:08:44] stream ofal
[2:08:48] life and the church
[2:08:50] life it is a bond of
[2:08:54] stability a family can only be
[2:08:59] strong when it has got a strong
[2:09:02] fire and the church can be strong if it
[2:09:07] has strong
[2:09:08] fathers if you want a dying
[2:09:11] Church become a man without a
[2:09:16] backbone because the church is depending
[2:09:19] on you nurture the
[2:09:22] children that God has given to
[2:09:25] you the pastor will not take over the
[2:09:29] RO of raising up your children the
[2:09:33] pastor is just an encouraging
[2:09:36] Factor he comes to encourage you that
[2:09:39] fight on young
[2:09:41] man fight on young man you have overcome
[2:09:45] the wicked oh I stumbled yesterday yes
[2:09:49] but and
[2:09:51] that's how we should look at one
[2:09:54] another amen that's a
[2:09:58] father Amen in the Kingdom of
[2:10:01] Israel the
[2:10:03] emphasis was raised among men and young
[2:10:07] men hallelujah hallelujah the women were
[2:10:11] not
[2:10:12] counted amen when they were planning the
[2:10:16] military
[2:10:18] strategy they looked at the men
[2:10:22] give us the number of
[2:10:25] men in the tri of Judah that can
[2:10:30] handle men who can go on their knees and
[2:10:34] to pray for one another that's the
[2:10:37] strongest weapon that God has given his
[2:10:43] church amen so you see military
[2:10:49] planning and Leadership was
[2:10:51] weaved around
[2:10:54] men that's why John
[2:10:57] says
[2:10:58] fathers because you have known him that
[2:11:01] is from the
[2:11:03] beginning men who have a personal
[2:11:05] experience with
[2:11:08] God they are born
[2:11:10] again hallelujah hallelujah he says
[2:11:13] father because you have known
[2:11:16] him from the
[2:11:19] beginning by the time you get
[2:11:22] children known him in the beginning God
[2:11:27] looked at your
[2:11:28] maturity and then says it's not good for
[2:11:32] a man to dwell
[2:11:33] alone give him a help
[2:11:36] me says you have known the Lord by the
[2:11:40] time you bring forth your children so
[2:11:42] what am I saying tonight if this as not
[2:11:45] been your
[2:11:46] standing you must now stand as a man
[2:11:53] and be a father to
[2:11:57] Generations life begins from the
[2:12:01] fatherhood men who have
[2:12:04] studed and related to
[2:12:08] God and they know where Adam
[2:12:11] fa and they will not let that
[2:12:15] happen amen so he says I've written unto
[2:12:19] you young men
[2:12:21] because you are strong and the word of
[2:12:24] God
[2:12:25] Abid are you here young men are you
[2:12:29] strong in the
[2:12:30] faith yes sir let your children come to
[2:12:35] church amen it is not just a
[2:12:39] tradition it's a
[2:12:42] requirement amen we used to stay far
[2:12:46] away about 30 some years
[2:12:49] ago and then hope used to sing in the
[2:12:53] used to like singing special
[2:12:57] song and then she would
[2:12:59] leave and pass through a sugar
[2:13:04] Plantation sometimes
[2:13:08] unaware and we find she has gone because
[2:13:12] she wants to be early enough to sing
[2:13:17] a today somebody asked for a song I mean
[2:13:21] a special
[2:13:23] song when the service has
[2:13:26] started young men be
[2:13:32] strong be strong a young man missing a
[2:13:39] service
[2:13:40] why I've have written to you because you
[2:13:44] have Str you have overcome the
[2:13:48] wicked young men say we have won him
[2:13:54] that is
[2:13:59] wicked you see this is John is very
[2:14:05] practical when young men are strong in
[2:14:07] the
[2:14:08] word then young sisters are safe in the
[2:14:12] church they keep coming to church they
[2:14:16] are very happy they see calab growing
[2:14:21] they see Silas is
[2:14:26] growing so they are there very
[2:14:29] excited there is a
[2:14:31] redeemer coming to the image of
[2:14:35] Christ are you together with me yes sir
[2:14:39] that's what we are looking for and
[2:14:43] listen God dealt differently with
[2:14:47] Abraham Abraham became a strong
[2:14:52] foundation for
[2:14:54] ISAC he could have dealt with Isaac
[2:14:58] differently but Isaac became a strong
[2:15:02] foundation for Jacob to stand
[2:15:05] on Jacob spre out 12
[2:15:10] branches the 12
[2:15:13] Pats all together they made the strong
[2:15:17] Nation

[2:15:31] scripture and I will establish my

[2:23:53] Kings God is a
[2:23:57] father God is a
[2:24:00] father can we say
[2:24:02] this God
[2:24:06] is and then together our
[2:24:11] father now to some of us who have
[2:24:14] children
[2:24:15] here we've said it together with our
[2:24:19] children Our Father even my
[2:24:22] grandchildren have been saying our
[2:24:24] father that's the relationship
[2:24:32] God so I want to take you a few
[2:24:36] scriptures here where you can become a
[2:24:39] generational
[2:24:41] father you could look behind you and
[2:24:45] your father was a
[2:24:47] drunker he was a drug addict
[2:24:50] it could be anything that you can point
[2:24:53] to he was a witch but now you can build
[2:24:59] the old west
[2:25:01] places and you become a
[2:25:04] father to
[2:25:09] Generations in First
[2:25:12] Kings
[2:25:14] 1511 and Assa did that which was right
[2:25:20] in the eyes of the Lord as did David his
[2:25:30] father but David was not the
[2:25:34] father but
[2:25:36] now because he was a
[2:25:39] king he was
[2:25:41] successful and the only
[2:25:44] King in success that could be pointed
[2:25:47] back
[2:25:49] to was David so David as far as kings
[2:25:54] was concerned he was the father to
[2:25:59] Generations are you together with me
[2:26:02] yeah try to become a father of
[2:26:05] generations became a father to the
[2:26:10] generations amen let's go down to se
[2:26:14] Kings
[2:26:18] 2250 and slept with his
[2:26:23] fathers and was bued with his
[2:26:26] fathers in the city of David
[2:26:31] father and yet David was not the natural
[2:26:36] father but what he
[2:26:39] planted as a king it furthered
[2:26:46] Generations
[2:26:48] amen then
[2:26:51] when you got Second Kings
[2:26:53] [Music]
[2:26:55] 18 I mean verse
[2:26:57] one I'm winding up on this
[2:27:01] concept now it came to pass in the Third
[2:27:04] Year
[2:27:08] ofos son of king of
[2:27:13] Egypt that Hezekiah the son of aaz King
[2:27:16] of Judah began to re
[2:27:23] amen began to do what began
[2:27:29] to 25 years old was he when he began to
[2:27:38] rain and he reigned
[2:27:40] 29 years in
[2:27:47] Jerusalem his mother's name also was AB
[2:27:50] the daughter of
[2:27:56] Zarah and he did that which was
[2:28:01] right in the sight of the
[2:28:04] Lord according to all that David
[2:28:08] [Music]
[2:28:12] father father to
[2:28:15] Generations fathers would you desire to
[2:28:18] be a father to Generations
[2:28:22] God
[2:28:23] Havey God
[2:28:26] usce when he comes to2 verse one second
[2:28:31] Kings he says Josiah was 80 years 8
[2:28:38] years when he began to rain and heed 31
[2:28:43] years in
[2:28:45] Jerusalem and his mother's name was Jed
[2:28:50] the daughter
[2:28:52] ofos and it is that which was right in
[2:28:55] the sight of the
[2:28:58] Lord and walked in the way of David's
[2:29:03] father so David is a generational
[2:29:08] father in the field of
[2:29:12] Kings
[2:29:14] amen that's
[2:29:16] why in the
[2:29:18] chronology chology
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:22] he's the only one that's referred to as
[2:29:26] The
[2:29:29] King The
[2:29:32] King Solomon is in the
[2:29:36] chronology but is not called the
[2:29:42] king listen Matthew 1 ver
[2:29:46] 6 and J David the king
[2:29:52] and the
[2:29:57] kingon and then they continue counting
[2:30:02] them want you want to be called a
[2:30:08] father the
[2:30:10] father who is the
[2:30:14] father of
[2:30:16] generations God want to see a man who
[2:30:19] can command and his
[2:30:21] family a father that plants
[2:30:26] principles
[2:30:28] bless for
[2:30:32] Generations look at
[2:30:35] Joshua chapter 24
[2:30:40] verse1 I want you to look at the
[2:30:43] scriptural
[2:30:46] principles and step in them
[2:30:50] and say father make me a father you look

[2:30:59] age we've got somebody to look
