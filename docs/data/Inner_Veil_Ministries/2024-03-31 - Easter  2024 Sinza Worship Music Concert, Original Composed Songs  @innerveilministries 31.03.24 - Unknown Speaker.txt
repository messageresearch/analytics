and then okay so the whole day we have dedicated it for worship praise the name of our Lord and our youth God has inspired them in several songs and even one day is just not enough praise the name so again we shall arrange during August or September during that second time holiday again the songs that the Lord has inspired them and again in January the Lord being gracious praise the name of you know there is something about worship as we are going to look at it this morning is that we were created to worship praise the name of our Lord and then you look at different instances how people were worshiping in the scriptures you know worship is something that is continuous worship is not going to stop here on Earth in that continuity but we want to start it while we are still in these bodies praise the name of our Lord just to get ourselves into worship praise the name of our Lord now let us stand up on our feet and then we have a word of Prayer let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ how we are so thankful unto you this morning the grace you've given unto us father come into your presence We Want to Thank You Lord that in your presence we get all that we have need of and now you bless us father and now you've already blessed us father after this time lord releasing us from all bondage from everything that's unlike you Lord now we call upon your name that as we go into the reading and the preaching of the word May the Holy Ghost himself come and speak to us father and put these things in our hearts that we may live every day to worship you and even all the songs father are going to be S that you put upon the hearts of our brothers and our sisters that they may be so anointed bring Deliverance Joy blessings upon us Lord not only today heavenly father but wherever they are s in whatever situation whatever person they may be blessed father we love you Lord and we thank you Lord we also commit our pastor into your hands as ministers today Father may you use him for your services and bless him in such a special Lord we thank you and honor you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to Revelations chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord Revelations chter 4 from verse 8 to verse 11 the Bible says and the four beasts and each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and and rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and which is to come [Music] and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the 4 and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying thou worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created may God bless his I want to preach on created to worship just for about 1 hour and then we shall love the songs for about an hour say that we break at around pm. and then we come back at 3 p.m. that that we can continue so we have been created to worship praise the name of our Lord God created us that we may worship him like here we've seen in Revelations chapter 4 right at the throne praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says that these creatures the four living creatures they each of them had wings round about them you know six wings and then they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy Lord God Almighty was which was which is and which is to come and now when the 24 Elders the Bible says hear this when the 24 Elders when they hear these BS giving glory and honor and S that sat on the throne who live for ever and ever they also fall down before him and then cast their Thrones before him praise the name of our then they also sing shout you are worthy oh Lord receive glory and honor and power for you have created all things for your pleasure they were created and for your pleasure they are so God created us and our being is because of the Lord praise the name of the Lord you are here because of God you are are born because of God you are living because of God so you have a reason to Worship the Lord praise the name of our Lord each of us we have a reason to whatever you going through you have a reason to worship he has created you he has made you praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says we are the Sheep of his Pastor praise the name of our Lord he has made us we are what we are because of the Lord praise the name of the Lord and so don't allow the devil to start making you think of what you you think you should be but you have not been this way or when you look at your neighbor or when you look at your Breen or you look at your colleagues they are better than me this they are better than don't look at that look at what the Lord has made you to praise the name of the Bible says is all the body the hand no so if you are the eye you are the eye if you are the ear you are the if you are the nose you are the nose whatever portion of the body the Lord has made to you just need to thank him for that praise the name of the Lord we have a reason to worship God has created us that we may worship Him praise the name of our Lord and in worshiping God God wants us to walk before him God wants us to seek Him Praise the name of our Lord you know you are seeking the Lord you are having a longing for the Lord you are having a desire for the Lord And now when you have that longing for God you have that desire for the Lord and then you serve the Lord in whatever form you are in at your home at your place of work wherever you live you you serve the Lord in whatever kind of thing he has given you to do praise the name of our Lord and when you seek the Lord you serve the Lord then you need to Worship the Lord praise the name of our Lord so then our lives should be fully attached to the Lord that my being the way I am is just because the Lord is praise the name of our Lord he has been so good to us praise the name of our Lord so good to you he has given you the life he has given you the being he has protected you he has provided all that you have so you have reason to worship you have reason to serve you have reason to seek him you have reason to Worship the Lord all the days of your life praise the name of our Lord so you see that in the scriptures Before the Throne of God they saying holy holy praise the name of our Lord even us our life should sound that Holiness to the Lord praise the name of the Lord the Bible says when high priest on his crown on his head they put Holiness and righteousness unto the Lord it should also be the same thing to us that our lives reflect the Holiness of God our lives reflect the righteousness of God praise the name of our like when Pastor was preaching last Sunday why do you need to be angry okay you may be annoyed but the Bible says don't allow anger you know the sun to go over your anger praise the name of the Lord you know when you are living in Anger you are in bondage yourself so how are you going to worship and when you are angry you end up [Music] complaining how are you going toship and anger brings bitterness praise the name of our Lord and bitterness is not part of the Holy Spirit praise the name of the Lord so you get that girl of bitterness away you just put it aside even us do you want to eat things which are bitter have you ever seen somebody eating bitter things and he's smiling and you find it is so painful so even people are angry that's how they bit before other people you shouldn't be like that praise the name of the Lord we should that kind of temperance you know bearing with one another praise the name of the Lord loving one another desing one another praise the name of our Lord whereby you feel when your brother is in a mistake you don't take you know offense about it but you stand with such a one in prayer and that's what we are called for praise the name of don't allow anger be there otherwise it will hinder and you see the Bible says let us go to Ephesians 4:31 praise the name of our lordian 4 verse it says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit by which you are sealed until the day of redemption and how can you worship without the Holy Spirit how can you worship when the scripture tells us when we go to John chapter 4 praise the name of our Lord and then verse 23 the Bible says but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship [Music] Him says God seeks the worshipers true worshipers to worship him in his spirit and in his truth but now you have grieved the Holy Ghost how are you going to worship so your worship is not go back to Ephesians chapter 4 and then verse 31 let all bitterness and R and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all so now you see here bitterness griefs the Holy Ghost R gas the Holy Ghost griefs the Holy Ghost clor griefs the Holy Ghost evil speaking gri the Holy Ghost all gri the Holy Ghost so you can't worship if you are angry you can't worship if you are in bitterness you can't worship if you are wrathful you can't worship if you doing clamor you can't worship if you evil speaking and you can't was if you have Marice and that's why the Bible says when you come and bring your sacrifice to The Altar and you remember that you have something against somebody then the scripture says go and make it right with that and then you come and offer your sacrifice and then your sacrifice will be accepted when Cain Came To Worship the Bible says Cain was rejected with his sacrifice why the condition of his life was not acceptable before God and we should also live every day that the conditions our life are always acceptable before the Lord praise the name of the Lord that should be your desire like when we read in Psalms chapter 19 praise the name of the Lord Psalms chapter 19 and then we going pick that scripture verse 14 it says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight oh Lord my Str and my redeemer every day Liv in that kind of life let the ones that come out of my mouth be acceptable before you help me not to do Rong help me not to do back biting help me not to do clamoring praise the name of our Lord help me not to do evil speak but let the words out of my mouth be acceptable before you praise the name of our Lord and let the meditation of my heart be acceptable before you let me not think evil about any person let me not imagine evil about another person if I here they doing something WR Lord help me to pray for them help me to intercede for them that should always be our desire right where at home or at your place of work or where you stud from that's the life the Lord wants us to leave and when you are living such a life that you're not grieving the Holy Ghost it's not difficult for you to be in rythm musicians know what rhythm is praise the name of our Lord you know to be in the same wavelength okay that's good enough praise the name of the Lord with the angels when they are worshiping you know you are just in that kind of tune you are connected in that Heavenly worship praise the name of our why because you're doing what is acceptable before your life is worshiping praise the name of our whenever the high priest whenever he would walk into the holies of holies he had Bells around him and they were sounding all the time and his walk before the Lord would sound holy is the Lord God alight even our lives should be holy all the time praise the name of our Lord not just talking about it but living the a life of worship we were created toship praise the name of our that when they look at you the Bible says they will glorify the father by your good works if you a shopkeeper praise the name of somebody comes and gives you more money you asking for 2000 and then he's giving you 1,000 three times and then he gives you not knowing and then you check God does not give like tell him you've given me more money then say this man is true and then he will than the Lord praise the name of you've asked Maybe for five things and he giving you seven no this five is enough because that's what youve asked for praise the name of the Lord but not looking cheating around the bush that one is not a life true before God praise the name of our Lord you know you need to live a life of Holiness a life of righteousness a life worthy the Gospel of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord and so your words your meditation will be acceptable before why your walk is worth like job when job was moving until God challenged Satan there's nobody on earth like look what his life look at whatever he does he lived the life of worship and we also need to live a life of worship praise the name of our Lord a life of worship a life obedient to the word of God a life of service to the Lord a life of seeking the Lord praise the name of our Lord that's what the Lord wants us to do praise the name of our Lord let us go and read in Dey chapter and then verse 19 praise the name of our Lord 8:19 the Bible says and it shall be if thou do all for if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that you shall surely [Music] perish now look at this there are three things he's talking about others he says first serving other gods okay first walking after other gods in other words seeking after them all your mind all your intent and then after that serving them then after serving them woring them now let us turn it around praise the name of the Lord seeking the Lord God Almighty you seek him and when you find him praise the name of you serve him in other words you do what he desires you to do how do you seek the Lord by reading his word praise the name of our Lord by praying unto him by fasting you are seeking him Lord I'm here to seek you you are meditating upon his word you are reading his word you are hearing his word so you are seeking the Lord and the Bible says if you seek you shall find praise the name of our Lord so then you seek the Lord praise the name of our Lord that is part of why we were created is that we seek the Lord and when you seek Him He says you shall find me now let us go to 2 coron 15 and then verse one and the spirit of God Came Upon aaria the son of ODed and he went to meet Assa and said unto him here ye me Assa and all Judah and Benjamin the Lord is with you while you be with him and if you seek Him He will be found of you but if you forsake for AK Him He will forsake you praise the name of the Lord he says the Lord is with you while you are with Him Praise the name of our Lord how many of us have the Lord this morning praise the name of so if you don't

Him how do you do that think about him read his word pray unto him serve him and don't forsake Him don't turn your back to him but now F him and say Lord like I just love that scripture you know when came to David and then David say oh I want to build for the Lord a res place I want to build for the Lord a house and then Prophet Nathan told David do all that's in your heart because God is with you what an assurance that a prophet would tell the king do as you have said the Lord is with you and now when Nathan had just left David the word of the Lord came to Oh Praise the name of such sure mercies you know the sure mercies of David God coming to declare his Everlasting confidence and say go and tell my servant David I took him from the ship to not rule over my people and then God kept on narrating the whole thing and then he said the seat the throne will be for him forever great Assurance praise the name of our Lord and then the Lord told David praise the name of our through na that your children one of your children will build for me the house praise the name of our and now when David heard the words of n do you want to hear the words of God God every day it's available to you every day that word is available before you in the text in the Bible in the message books when we come here to church we are hearing the word of God you are hearing the promises of God you are hearing what the Lord assurances is giving you praise the name of the Lord he said if you are with God then is with you praise the name of the Lord you take it by faith and say this is mine praise the name of Lord you don't look around who is that one no it is yours praise the name of so David when he heard the words from nas he he went into the house of God then he sat and said oh God who am I that you would think about me above all men have all these kind of praise the name of he went to worship praise the name and here we have also come to worship we have reasons to worship every day that you wake up you have a reason to worship Lord I Thank you for the night Lord I Thank you for the new in the evening you have a reason to worship Lord I Thank you for the day I thank you for your protection you have a reason to worship and we need to live a life of worship whether you at at night whether you don't have school fees whether even the month has come to an end today and the landlord is telling you tonight you're not sleeping in my house you have a reason to watch praise the name you don't worship because of circumstance oh when I'm good God is good when I'm feeling bad I I doubt if God is good God is good all the time praise the name so all the time worship you the Lord praise the name of regardless of your condition regardless of your circumstance learn to worship praise the name of our learn to worship God for the great things he has done Lear to worship God for the things he has made known unto you praise the name of when you read in the scriptures you know they were worshiping God by the things he did like we can look at in Genesis 24 praise the name of our Lord Genesis chter 24 and then verse 26 the Bible says you knowa had been committed to go and get a wife for Isaac and you know you don't know the person you're also not sure of the city so he prayed with AB he prayed with Abraham and then Abraham said the Ang of the Lord will go ahead of you praise the name of and you know looking for a husband or a wife is not an easy task praise the name of Lord it may be easy to get other things but to get the right person it only takes God that's what the Bible says that from fathers you can get lands you can get wealth you can get riches but a Prudent Wife comes only from the Lord that's what it is nobody can give you that it's only the Lord who knows the right person so Abraham told God will send his angel and so reached at the outskirts of the city at the well praise the name of if you are looking for a God-fearing wife you don't go to disco they not there the if you're looking for a God-fearing wife you don't go for beauty pageant the some last month I was moving around and then I saw some post that you don't go for that miss you not get them they values are not the values of God praise the name of their values be naked walk like a [Music] cat catwalk that's what they do tting themselves like a cat Andress themselves those are not values of the kingdom of so you can't go there and get them praise the name of our Lord and you know like in the Bible the woman at the came to pick water when it is hot that's the time where those immoral women would go so didn't go at that time he went in the evening when the Virgin Daughters of the city come to Pi praise the name of so when you are praying for a wife you don't go to those funny places they're not there and then some people they go to funerals are you going to get somebody to keep on mouring you you know that one knows to cry and now it is so funny in the world you know the way they get hired sers they even get hired moners get onions put in your eyes on the in the car they have been coming laughing but when they reach where the dead body is they are Weeping and you start wondering so you don't do that kind of places you go to places praise the name of where people have the character of God praise the name of our so now when he reached the world he prayed in his heart oh Lord help me to get that person that you have ordained for Isaac the Bible says he prayed in his heart he kept it as a secret then he said Lord let that person whom I'll say give me some water and he gives me the water but does not only stop at giving me but also gives the C the there was a mystery there praise the name of our Lord the mystery was there other people didn't know what was happening and then Rebecca comes can you give me to drink and then she goes and FES water and then gives him and then afterwards she started fairing water to feed all the C what a character praise the name of she had such a character and was looking for that character and even in marriage we look for the character of Jesus Christ praise the name of our there is a person who was telling me you know I know that [Music] person I praise the Lord so you need to know the person you are Maring and look for the character of Jesus and Only God who knows the right person and Only God Can R to the right so now when Rebecca had given the water to the C was like oh God how you blessed my oh God he was so surprised let us go to Genesis chapter4 and then verse 19 okay let us start from verse 17 and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy picture and she said drink my Lord and she HED and let down her te from her hand and gave him to drink and when he had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and she HED and amped her picture into the tra and ran again unto the world to draw water and Drew for all his and the man wondering at her held his peace to whether the Lord has made his journey prosperous or not and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking and the man took a golden earring of half a shkel weight two bracelets for hands of 10 shekels weight of gold and he said whose daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there a room in thy father's house for us to LOD in and she said unto him I am the daughter of bethl the son of Mila she bear unto Noah for she said moreover unto him we have both strong and provider enough and room to Lodge [Music] in praise the name of the Lord whatever desire see how the Lord answered one by one one by one one by one and when El saw this is the Lord is doing praise the name of like the way they love singing that song said this is the Lord this is what the Lord has done so what did he do in verse 26 and the man bow down his head and Worship the Lord and he saying blessed be the Lord of my master who has not left D my master of his mercy and this truth I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's Brethren praise the name of the Lord he started by worshiping and that should be how we start our day start by worship go through it depending upon the Lord having faith in the Lord Lord this is my desire Lord this is my desire the name of our Lord and then the Lord gives you the grace when you are leaving home and then you meet an accident on the road so Lord have mercy upon you and then you reach the place of work say Lord I thank you I'm here praise the name of maybe you have a staff meeting maybe you have some assignments and then you present the assignment and then it's acceptable you have reason to thank them and was doing the same what he was sent to how the Lord led him to the house where Abraham comes from so he was worshiping we have reasons to worship praise the name of the Lord you have reason to Worship in whatever thing the Lord gives you you have reason to worship and say Lord I Thank You Lord I bless your holy name being so gracious to me you being so wonderful to every day Learn To Worship the Lord praise the name of our like just this has been the end of the month and the people who work and given salaries and then now they were going either to the banks or to ATM machines there's a friend of mine who called me the other day my name has been deleted now I don't know what to do now for name has not been deleted you have reason Tok God prise the name of Lord you have reason to you know what has God done he's the one who is touching those people are paying praise the name of and is one giving you the ability to go to the ATM machine and withdraw the money you're [Music] not you have to he has given you the good health he has given you the ability to eat of what you've planted praise the name of our because the Bible says some will plant and then others eat some will build and others sleeping they just come and s in the house you bu when for you are not there but it's the Lord who blesses you that whatever you do you able enjoy it praise the name of our Lord it is the Lord and then the Bible says some produce but other people who enjoy the efforts of their children then they start saying that man died so early they are enjoying the benefits of your children but now if the Lord has so blessed you that you are able to see your children grow you able to see your children rise up praise the name of our then you rejoice and then you worship God praise the name of our it is the Lord doing all this you know then some you plant or you have a good animal when you go to sleep you wake up in the morning it's not there it's the Lord who protects your animals not be stolen the Lord protects your Gardens not be stolen you have reason to worship praise the name of the Lord so worship that the Lord had his prayer praise the name of our then in verse 48 of Genesis chapter 24 then he said and I bow down my head and worshiped the Lord and bless the Lord God of my master Abraham which which led me in the right way to take my Master's brother's daughter unto his [Music] son and now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell tell me that I may turn to the right hand or to the left verse 49 then lean and Beth answered and said the thing proceed from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good behold Rebecca is before thee take her and go and let her be thy Master son's wife as the Lord has spoken praise the name of our Lord what a good day to start with the Lord just surrendering yourself to the Lord Lord lead me this ordain my foot path whever I go I may be a blessing to the people praise the name of the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart may be acceptable unto you you see how started see how s the Lord along the way see how was serving the lord and now at the end of The Journey your words are the words of the Lord praise the name of our Lord and how the Lord desires to use every one of us that you can speak words of comfort praise the name of our you can speak words of encouragement that you can speak words that can give hope to another person not words that will make them do it no don't speak the words of you know come and wanted to kill the whole Jews so his words were bitter his words were terrible praise the name of our but then the Lord changed it praise the name of our Lord let us go to the Book of Esther the book of EST and then we read in in chapter 10 and then verse three for the Jew was next unto King aelas and great among the Jews and acceptable of the mud of his Brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seity speaking peace seeking the welfare of his people and if we are in the body of Jesus Christ your heart's desire should be good towards everybody praise the name of our Lord you bless your brother you bless your sister you bless your children you bless your parents but you don't Cur them praise the name of but you bless them Lord be merciful unto my Lord be merciful unto my sister and if you can stand to help stand there to stand by your stand there to stand by to help your sister all your neighbors all your family praise the name of the Lord this is what we are called to do is to bless others look at Joseph when the brother thought to do evil to him and when their father Jacob died they were afraid of Joseph but the Bible says Joseph comforted his Brethren he gave them Comfort said going to feed all your children I'm going take care of all of you that's the life of Jesus CHR and that's the life that we need to leave not seeking Revenge not seeking to do evil because they done evil with good praise the name of our we need to live a life where God takes over all our praise the name of so when praise the name recognize it's the Lord speaking to you again fell down and worship praise the name of our Lord in Genesis CH 24 and then verse 52 praise the name of our Lord and it came to pass when Abraham's servant heard their words he worshiped the Lord bowing himself to the Earth Genesis 24 verse 52 praise the name of our Lord we need to Worship the Lord now we go to Genesis chter 4 and then verse 41 Genesis ver 31 4: 31 31 and the people believed and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their Affliction then they bought their heads and worshiped exus gen rather it's Exodus sorry Exodus 4:31 so when God was doing great things they worshiped him and the Lord is also doing great things in our lives God is doing great things in our families he's doing great things where we live where we work where we the it's time to worship you just say Lord I Lord I worship you for the great things that you have done praise the name of and now you see also when people felt the presence of God they worshiped in Joshua 5:1 15 Joshua chter 5 verse 14 the Bible says let us start from verse 13 and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drone in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him at TH for us of for our [Music] adversaries we go to the next verse verse 14 and he said n but as the captain of the host of the Lord I am come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what say my Lord unto his praise the name of when they realize the presence of God they worshiped praise the name of our and you can also draw the presence of God through praise through meditation singing songs Sweet Melody and then the presence of God comes down and then you can was Lord I Thank You Lord You Are Holy Lord you are worthy for the great things that you have done when the spirit of God would come when they going for a battle and then God tells them take this direction they would all fall down and we need to live a life of worshiping and allowed the Lord to take over all our lives everything that praise the name of God at your school at your place of work in your businesses at your home allow go to take over and when the Lord takes over you will see how he will lead every step and then you can live in worship praise the name of our Lord worshiping him in the morning worshiping him in the afternoon him ining praise the name of our Lord we need to Lear learn live a life of worship praise the name of our Lord when you feel his presence you worship him when he gives you a revelation you worship Him Praise the name of Lord when he makes anything known to you worship Him Praise the name of the Lord in Revelations 5 praise the name of our Lord you know when the lamb had come to get the book all the host of Heaven they fell down and worshiped Lord your worthy Lord your worthy Lord your worthy praise the name of God now in the message Revelations 4 part two now the 20 and four Elders I want you to notice they were not Angelic beings angels are not associated but they not Heavenly beings are not associated with crowns and Thrones see they are never Associated they never did overcome if you notice a little later on the songs that they s and the things proved that they W they sang the song of redemption so Angels don't need to be redeemed but they were redeemed men and the 24 Elders in the message of the hour they were the TR of Patriarchs sons of Jacob and then the train of Apostles they worshiped songs of redemption praise the name of our Lord and we have also been redeemed praise the name of our Lord now in the message this he says that's right that's exactly right hold your faith in God that is right oh God always had a people who would believe him back y when he come out of the Wilderness he brought the children of Israel rather Into the Wilderness what a time after they had crossed the Red Sea got over there they had an old fashion camp [Music] meeting praise the name of our Lord looked back and seen the all the old task Masters dead in the sea when they were crossing the Red Sea and you know pharaoh and all their army was against them chasing them and then the Lord fought the Battle for them until they crossed the dry landine in the Red Sea and now these Egyptians they wanted to partake of that praise the name of our Lord and now when the children of Israel had finished then the Lord told Moses let the water be released and then the water was released and he killed all the Egyptians were following what a victory did that was that your enemy is dead praise the name of our Lord and so your brother Bram is saying they looked back and seen all the task Masters dead in the miam begin to dance in the spirit and beat a tambin a very typical picture of an old fashioned camp meeting Moses got in the spirit and raised up his hands and sang a song in the spirit that eight and old fashioned meeting I never seen one and now look God promised to supply all their needs and just when they crossed over why they didn't have nothing but a little box of bread sitting on top of their head give out so God promise would Supply their name the next morning when they got up the ground was laying full of manner praise the name of so when they crossed the Red Sea and their enemies were dead now you'll see how the Lord works out praise the name of our God tells Pharaoh let my people go he refuses until now the first borns are killed in their houses and then now faraoh says hey we all going to die then he releases now when they start going they remember these people have been working for us and then those demons started following them can you imagine and then the Lord made a path and these demons kept on following them and then God Dively provided and they also kept on following but they did not they following for their destruction and they were destroyed in the r SE praise the name of so what happened in Exodus 15 Moses and the children of Israel sang the song of redemption redeemed now I love to proclaim the name of our Lord and this Resurrection Day we have a new song of redemption he is risen is present he's not seing the grave but he's alive forever praise the name of our Lord we have a song of Victory

opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and he said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and
