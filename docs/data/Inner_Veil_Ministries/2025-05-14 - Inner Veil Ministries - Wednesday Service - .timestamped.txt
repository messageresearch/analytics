[20:35] Uh I have almost nothing to share
[20:42] but since an opportunity is granted by
[20:45] the
[20:48] pastor and let me just keep continuing
[20:51] with where we ended last
[20:55] Wednesday. Let me continue with where we
[20:57] ended last Wednesday.
[21:05] Amen. Amen. Hope it will be a
[21:09] blessing to us.
[21:13] Now the Bible says
[21:17] uh in the book of
[21:20] uh
[21:24] Ecclesiastes
[21:27] 12 verse
[21:33] 13 the Bible says
[21:38] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[21:41] matter.
[21:43] Fear God and keep his commandments for
[21:47] this is the whole duty of man.
[22:09] And
[22:11] also so we are going to follow this from
[22:15] the book of Mark chapter
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] 10. Chapter 10.
[22:25] Let us only
[22:26] read one verse and we see it. We shall
[22:29] follow it up.
[22:35] Mark chapter
[22:36] 10 and verse 21.
[22:42] The Bible says, "Then Jesus beholding
[22:46] him, loved
[22:50] him,
[22:52] and saith unto him,
[23:01] One
[23:01] [Music]
[23:05] thing, go thy way, sell whatsoever thou
[23:10] hast, and give to the poor, and thou
[23:13] shalt have treasure in heaven, and come
[23:17] take up the cross, and follow me.
[23:38] May the Lord add a blessing to the
[23:39] reading of the
[23:41] word. You know the Bible
[23:45] said, "Keep the
[23:49] commandments. Praise the Lord.
[23:53] Fear God
[23:55] and keep the commandments.
[24:00] Therefore, like I said,
[24:04] the word fear
[24:07] God doesn't mean to be afraid of
[24:13] God, you know, or to be a scared of him
[24:18] or something like that.
[24:21] Praise the
[24:22] Lord. To
[24:25] believers, God is our
[24:29] friend. Praise the
[24:31] Lord. And the way he deals with
[24:34] us, he deals with us as his
[24:39] children. That's why he can't hide any
[24:42] inheritance for us.
[24:50] anything for
[24:52] us he presents
[24:55] it but
[24:56] [Music]
[24:58] unbelievers it sounds like parables to
[25:02] them praise the lord like eternal
[25:07] life I don't think whether any believers
[25:10] have ideas of eternal
[25:15] life there must be
[25:18] something to be
[25:21] done and that
[25:24] one it's Christ whom you have
[25:28] received who will tell you what to do
[25:33] next. Praise the Lord. Fear
[25:36] God, keep his
[25:39] commandments. In other words, respect
[25:43] [Music]
[25:44] God. Praise the Lord.
[25:47] Give him
[25:50] reverence in order to tell you which
[25:54] commandments to
[25:56] do. Fear God and keep the
[25:59] commandments and God demands
[26:03] it. Praise the Lord. Last time we talked
[26:06] about
[26:07] Joseph
[26:09] and Joseph was one who moved without his
[26:14] pastor around
[26:18] him. He
[26:21] moved. The pastors were not
[26:26] there. Praise the Lord. Far
[26:31] off. Praise the Lord. But the fear of
[26:34] God in
[26:36] him helped him to overcome all the
[26:40] challenges that he
[26:44] had. The wife came, the boss's wife
[26:50] came. Lie with
[26:53] me. Know that he did it daily. He didn't
[26:58] say it once and gave up. He consistently
[27:00] requested for him to lie with him.
[27:07] Praise the Lord. Lie with
[27:11] me.
[27:13] But because he feared the
[27:17] Lord the presence of God was along with
[27:24] him.
[27:25] Joseph got
[27:28] wisdom from God overcome that woman.
[27:34] Praise the Lord. What was that? The fear
[27:37] of
[27:40] God. Praise the Lord. The fear of God
[27:44] caused Joseph overcome such matters of
[27:47] his life.
[27:50] Now we are talking about
[27:53] like pastor knocked something which was
[27:56] mine last last
[27:59] Sunday. Pastor talked about something
[28:01] which was mine last
[28:08] Sunday. Praise the Lord. I know the
[28:11] youths know about this now. The youths
[28:14] know about
[28:16] this that Daniel
[28:20] He had the fear of
[28:22] God until when he brought the nice meals
[28:26] for the
[28:30] kings. Praise the Lord. The Bible say,
[28:33] the prophet says
[28:36] that he would not defile
[28:40] himself. Praise the Lord. Let me ask the
[28:44] question.
[28:46] I don't know which kind of food it was
[28:48] to defile this
[28:52] man. Praise the Lord. Because when you
[28:55] read the
[28:56] Bible, they were told to eat good
[29:00] food because they were going to be
[29:02] presented before the
[29:05] king. The food seems to be good. It was
[29:09] good. But because the enemy or idols
[29:12] were the ones doing it for him,
[29:19] They refused
[29:21] it. Praise the Lord. The Bible clearly
[29:24] says Joseph was
[29:28] handsome. And that was true. But because
[29:32] the lies of the enemy came through the
[29:34] woman that you
[29:40] handsome, I mean, Joseph never had that
[29:43] statement.
[29:46] He just said the lies. I can't
[29:51] hack yet.
[29:54] Praise the Lord. Even us as young
[29:59] people. Enemies can your enemy can
[30:02] appoint you and say you're a beautiful
[30:05] girl. Even you handsome
[30:09] man. But as long as it's not God saying
[30:12] that,
[30:14] Those are lies of the
[30:17] enemy because he's using your
[30:21] beauty to implant something that will
[30:24] defile that
[30:28] beauty. Praise the Lord. If you have the
[30:31] fear of
[30:32] God to help
[30:34] you, notice how the enemy speaks and God
[30:47] that thing will be
[30:48] there. Praise the Lord whereby the enemy
[30:51] can speak right
[30:54] words. If he's the enemy, I can't take
[30:58] his words. But if God is speaking the
[31:01] same words I've heard from the
[31:05] enemy, read it to
[31:08] me. Praise the Lord.
[31:11] Otherwise without they can learn
[31:13] something different in your
[31:16] life taken away from your
[31:21] testimony. Praise the Lord.
[31:24] Now this young
[31:28] man Christ
[31:30] came before
[31:32] him even ran before
[31:35] Christ. What did he want from there?
[31:39] something he was
[31:42] lacking. Praise the Lord. When you read
[31:45] the Bible, the Bible clearly
[31:48] says, "The young man kept the
[31:52] commandments which Jesus had told
[31:57] him. I've kept them from my youths."
[32:03] Meaning he had good mother, he had good
[32:09] father. Praise the Lord. But one thing
[32:13] he was
[32:15] lacking. Praise the Lord. And that thing
[32:18] the only person who gives it to
[32:21] you Christ
[32:23] himself. So if you come to him
[32:28] himself, the one who gives you that
[32:31] thing, what is that? Who gives you the
[32:34] nature of
[32:36] God helps you to fear
[32:40] God in order to overcome the enemy in
[32:44] anything. Praise the Lord. What happened
[32:48] here? This young
[32:52] man, praise the Lord, the young man met
[32:56] Christ.
[32:59] Amen. When he met Christ,
[33:02] the prophet says, he was confronted with
[33:06] another
[33:09] problem. And it confronts all of us,
[33:15] eternal life.
[33:17] Religion doesn't give us eternal
[33:21] life. Religious is a
[33:25] coverary but it don't it don't give us
[33:29] eternal life.
[33:33] him. That man told the young
[33:38] man who was taught with the best
[33:43] teachers there
[33:45] was yet I mean he was yet lacking
[33:51] something. He had good
[33:54] teachers that there
[33:57] was. Praise the Lord. But he was lacking
[34:01] something. Praise the Lord. What is good
[34:04] with this young
[34:06] man? What I admire from this young
[34:10] man. The prophet says
[34:13] this. He
[34:15] knew that he was lacking.
[34:20] That's what I admire from him. He knew
[34:23] that something on him was
[34:26] lacking. And what happened? He had to
[34:30] seek
[34:31] it. And when he sought it and the
[34:35] solution was given, that's where the
[34:37] problem
[34:40] came, even us. When Christ comes before
[34:44] us, there are many things he has carried
[34:47] for us. And when he doesn't when we
[34:50] don't give him a good
[34:53] environment, we don't benefit from
[34:57] them. Praise the Lord. So the young man
[35:01] knew he lacked
[35:02] something. But he put a lot of efforts
[35:05] to look for
[35:08] it because it's not Christ who went to
[35:11] him. It's him who Christ and he come to
[35:17] Christ him.
[35:20] what shall I do to do
[35:23] this? And the solution was given
[35:27] by he turned the solution
[35:29] aside and it was
[35:33] obvious. And the prophet
[35:35] says, so he knew the thoughts of the
[35:38] young
[35:41] man and said, "Keep the commandments."
[35:47] Praise the Lord. In other words, he
[35:50] wanted to see Christ wanted to see
[35:57] whe Amen. He wanted to see whether the
[36:00] young man fears
[36:03] God.
[36:04] Speaks, he will keep
[36:07] it. But God spoke to
[36:10] him
[36:11] solution. The Bible says which I grieve
[36:17] Praise the Lord. He went away sad.
[36:21] Praise the Lord. He was lacking
[36:26] something. Praise the Lord. And the
[36:29] prophet continues to
[36:33] say was to he was taught in the region
[36:37] of that
[36:42] day. Praise the
[36:45] Lord. in the law of that
[36:49] time.
[36:53] Yes. Those
[36:56] days by law and
[37:01] prophet and he was living in the
[37:05] law. Praise the Lord. But then what
[37:09] happened? He still didn't have eternal
[37:12] life.
[37:14] He wanted to know what to
[37:17] do. Been guided
[37:22] successfully. He's been guided
[37:25] successfully to
[37:27] that in the
[37:30] religion. But he when he was confronted
[37:33] with the eternal
[37:36] life refused to be here saying he was in
[37:41] the religion of that day.
[37:45] Praise the Lord. And then when he was
[37:52] confronted, praise the Lord, with
[37:55] eternal life
[37:57] itself, he refused to be guided to
[38:01] eternal
[38:04] life. Praise the Lord. And now let me
[38:07] say this.
[38:10] This young
[38:11] man had believed the
[38:14] laws. He knew the
[38:17] laws. Praise the Lord. Even in the
[38:20] message, we know the
[38:23] message. We know the Bible. We know
[38:26] about the
[38:28] godhead Jesus being
[38:31] God and his
[38:33] mysteries. But let me say like
[38:36] this. That
[38:38] way you were told
[38:40] well and that way Christ will love you
[38:44] for
[38:46] that. But that's not
[38:48] enough. Praise the Lord. You to come to
[38:52] church is not
[38:54] enough. You to read
[38:57] messages is not enough. What is enough
[39:01] is to meet Christ.
[39:04] show you another commandment that we
[39:10] lack. Praise the Lord.
[39:13] Sometimes Christ will
[39:16] come and then there are something he
[39:20] would like to say after you give him
[39:24] attention. Praise the Lord. Look at the
[39:27] scenario of Lazarus.
[39:32] When I read about
[39:34] Lazarus, he was dead.
[39:37] Praise the Lord. And Jesus came after
[39:41] many days or four something like
[39:43] that. Praise the
[39:46] Lord. And when he came, the man was
[39:49] dead. They had burdened
[39:52] him. Praise the Lord. Sitting on a
[39:58] grave. Jesus. Let me think. I think I
[40:00] will get the the verse so that we read
[40:03] it well.
[40:07] Praise the Lord. Mark Markapter
[40:16] 11. Yeah. Mark chapter 11. You know when
[40:19] Christ calls us
[40:22] or when we come to Christ,
[40:25] we come to be told
[40:31] what to do and how to go about things in
[40:34] our
[40:36] life if he doesn't talk to
[40:39] you when you are in his
[40:42] presence then
[40:45] wait praise the Lord when Christ doesn't
[40:48] talk to you in his
[40:52] presence
[40:53] wait either check out something may be
[40:57] wrong
[41:00] Praise the Lord. When Christ meets
[41:04] us or when we meet
[41:06] Christ, he has to
[41:10] speak. Praise the Lord. When this young
[41:13] man met
[41:15] Christ, when he met
[41:17] Christ, he had to speak to
[41:20] him. He
[41:23] had praise the Lord. And here comes a
[41:26] scenario.
[41:28] Lazarus Lazarus is dead And the butter.
