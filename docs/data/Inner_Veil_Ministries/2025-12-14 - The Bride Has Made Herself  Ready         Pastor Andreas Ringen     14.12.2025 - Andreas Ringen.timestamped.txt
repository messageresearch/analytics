[1:16:40] As long as you are flesh and blood,
[1:16:44] you'll always have something to bother
[1:16:46] you.
[1:16:49] But one thing which you do,
[1:16:52] just commit your burdens to the Lord.
[1:16:56] And that's what we are here to do.
[1:16:59] So when our brother comes here to
[1:17:01] minister,
[1:17:03] don't remain on the perimeters,
[1:17:07] but come in the center.
[1:17:10] in the anointing.
[1:17:12] And you say, "Lord,
[1:17:14] this is my burden.
[1:17:16] That is my burden." And I want to leave
[1:17:19] it there.
[1:17:20] Amen. Amen. Before the blood
[1:17:24] before, I mean before the, you know,
[1:17:27] Calvary,
[1:17:29] John, Peter, and James,
[1:17:34] they were on the perimeters.
[1:17:37] that after Calvary,
[1:17:40] when the blood has been poured,
[1:17:43] we have the ability to come to the
[1:17:45] center
[1:17:47] and experience the resurrection power
[1:17:52] where Elijah and Moses were
[1:17:55] in the presence when the Lord was
[1:17:57] unfolding his glory.
[1:18:00] So when our brother ministers,
[1:18:03] that's what we need to do this morning.
[1:18:06] How many of you have got needs this
[1:18:07] morning?
[1:18:09] Take them to the Lord.
[1:18:12] Leave them there.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we are very
[1:18:18] privileged once again
[1:18:21] to have our friend brother Andreas
[1:18:23] Ringan
[1:18:26] [applause] to be here again.
[1:18:30] You know he's faithful to the desire of
[1:18:32] his heart.
[1:18:36] that what the Lord gives him,
[1:18:39] he always want to come and share with
[1:18:41] us.
[1:18:43] Amen. Amen. So I want to welcome
[1:18:47] all the ministering brethren

[1:19:10] the army.

[1:19:23] Amen. Let's just stand with our brothers
[1:19:26] ministers to us this morning.
[1:19:29] We just want to invite you to the

[1:20:20] the end.
[1:20:23] Amen. Amen. And some needs will drop off
[1:20:29] as we are changing our bodies.
[1:20:33] So we will have needs till the end.
[1:20:36] Amen. Amen. So always bring them to the
[1:20:38] Lord.
[1:20:42] Amen. Amen.

[1:20:46] you greetings from the church at home
[1:20:50] from the believers in the north part of
[1:20:52] Germany.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And I I think I don't have to introduce
[1:20:57] myself.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You know me.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And thank you for brother Steven
[1:21:04] and brother James
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and for all the other brothers and other
[1:21:09] pastors for the for the very very
[1:21:12] wonderful uh um communication and
[1:21:16] working together.

[1:21:22] in in the Kala area Mukono
[1:21:26] with brother Fred and brother Moses.
[1:21:30] So we had a wonderful time over there.

[1:21:43] unless the last one is in.
[1:21:48] Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; So, uh we are trusting and we're doing

[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; because I think we are all we all want
[1:21:58] to go home.
[1:22:01] Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; The old the older you become
[1:22:05] the more you want to go home.
[1:22:08] When you have still a young body,
[1:22:11] sometimes you don't feel it's necessary.
[1:22:15] your body gets older,
[1:22:17] you know how necessary it is.

[1:22:46] and we are we have the same father
[1:22:50] maybe not the same mother
[1:22:53] because you know a mother stands for the

[1:23:00] but we have the same father.
[1:23:02] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[1:23:15] Understand this unites us.
[1:23:19] This makes us one.
[1:23:21] Not not the color makes us one.
[1:23:26] But we are one because we have the same
[1:23:29] father.
[1:23:30] Amen. And that makes us one.
[1:23:34] You know, you can do what you want. If
[1:23:37] God is not your father, how can you be
[1:23:40] one with somebody?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the world will know that God
[1:23:47] has sent his son.
[1:23:49] And that's how we we will manifest now.
[1:23:53] A unity that only can come
[1:23:57] because we have the same father.
[1:24:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. As we as we stand,

[1:25:47] righteousness of the saints.
[1:26:00] And he said unto me, "Write, blessed are
[1:26:02] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:26:05] supper of the Lamb."
[1:26:14] And he said unto me, And he said unto
[1:26:16] me, "These are the true sayings of God.
[1:26:22] Those
[1:26:26] who are called to the marriage supper of
[1:26:28] the lamb.
[1:26:32] They are the true sayings of God.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us pray together.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,

[1:27:17] what the spirit want to say to the
[1:27:18] church
[1:27:20] it father all to your own and to your
[1:27:22] glory
[1:27:24] in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:27:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You as you take
[1:27:29] your seats.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And I [clears throat] think it's so
[1:27:35] wonderful.
[1:27:38] I I I I wonder if you have if you have
[1:27:40] listened very carefully to that
[1:27:42] scripture.
[1:27:45] The Bible actually here makes makes a
[1:27:47] little difference
[1:27:50] between the marriage and the marriage
[1:27:52] supper.
[1:27:56] As we have read
[1:27:58] that the bride for the marriage of the
[1:28:00] lamb is come
[1:28:03] and his wife has made us have ready.
[1:28:07] So there's a readiness for the marriage
[1:28:09] of the lamb.
[1:28:13] Amen. Amen. So the marriage of the lamb
[1:28:15] is come.
[1:28:18] And then we have read in verse 9.
[1:28:22] And blessed are they that are that are
[1:28:24] called unto the marriage supper of the
[1:28:26] lamb.
[1:28:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. so ready for the
[1:28:33] marriage
[1:28:35] and then invited and called to the
[1:28:37] marriage supper.
[1:28:40] Now who will be there at the marriage
[1:28:42] supper?
[1:28:44] Who will be there at the marriage
[1:28:45] supper?
[1:28:47] Only those
[1:28:49] who were ready for the marriage
[1:28:53] and the prophet would say and I think
[1:28:56] that's so wonderful.
[1:28:59] He would say that out of pruning his
[1:29:00] words.
[1:29:03] Listen very carefully how the prophet
[1:29:04] said.
[1:29:06] He said in the day the son of man will
[1:29:08] be revealed
[1:29:11] to join the church to the head
[1:29:15] to unite.
[1:29:17] The marriage of the bride.
[1:29:21] Amen. Amen. The bridegroom call will
[1:29:23] come right through this.
[1:29:27] Son of man will come down and come in
[1:29:30] human flesh to unite the two together.
[1:29:38] The church has to be the word.
[1:29:42] He is the word and the two unite
[1:29:45] together.
[1:29:47] To do that it will take the
[1:29:49] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:29:51] son of man.
[1:29:55] Jesus son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:29:59] down in human flesh amongst us
[1:30:03] and will make the his word so real
[1:30:07] and let's unite the church and him as
[1:30:10] one
[1:30:13] then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:30:16] supper
[1:30:18] she is already united
[1:30:22] then we go to the wedding supper
[1:30:25] not to the marriage.
[1:30:29] So the marriage takes place here on
[1:30:31] earth.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The marriage takes place
[1:30:36] here on earth.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; The invisible union takes place.
[1:30:43] And as we have read Revelation 19,
[1:30:46] the marriage of the lamb is come.
[1:30:52] Watch very carefully. Not the marriage
[1:30:55] supper,
[1:30:57] but the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:31:02] and his wife has made herself ready.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And it was granted to her
[1:31:10] that she should array in fine linen
[1:31:14] which is the righteousness of the
[1:31:15] saints.
[1:31:18] Keep that a little bit in in in mind,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; what she's clothed with,
[1:31:25] what her readiness is.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; And as she is ready for marriage,
[1:31:33] now it's a question,
[1:31:35] are we ready also for the rapture,
[1:31:40] which is going to the wedding supper?
[1:31:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you follow?
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; So ready for the marriage.
[1:31:52] The marriage takes place here on earth.
[1:31:56] And then we go to the wedding supper
[1:31:59] which is by by the rapture.
[1:32:03] Is it right? We are raptured.
[1:32:06] So the marriage supper
[1:32:08] takes place in another dimension.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; As the marriage
[1:32:14] takes place here on earth.
[1:32:18] Amen. This is what we have seen. The son
[1:32:22] of man has come down
[1:32:24] and the bride has made herself ready.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question?
[1:32:30] Can I ask you a question? Do you feel
[1:32:32] ready?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I must be honest with you.
[1:32:39] I seldom feel ready.
[1:32:44] I seldom feel ready.
[1:32:54] You understand that? To be ready
[1:32:59] and to feel ready
[1:33:02] is two different things.
[1:33:05] Many times
[1:33:07] I don't feel ready.
[1:33:10] You know why? because I'm living in a
[1:33:13] body of flesh.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And this body of flesh
[1:33:18] still needs redemption.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; So don't trust your feeling.
[1:33:28] Don't trust your feeling.
[1:33:30] Don't depend on your feeling.
[1:33:35] Depend on what the Lord has done for
[1:33:38] you.
[1:33:40] JUST DEPEND ON WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR
[1:33:42] YOU.
[1:33:45] AMEN. AMEN. And the bride has prepared
[1:33:47] herself.
[1:33:49] And she was she was it was given unto
[1:33:51] her that she would array in fine linen.
[1:33:56] The fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:33:57] the saints.
[1:34:00] Amen. So you get that.
[1:34:03] So we the marriage
[1:34:06] takes place here on earth.
[1:34:09] That's why the son of man
[1:34:12] was manifested in human flesh again.
[1:34:17] And this is brother Bham says this is
[1:34:20] God uniting.
[1:34:22] There's an invincible union taking
[1:34:24] place.
[1:34:26] You and him become one.
[1:34:30] AND THEN WE GO TO THE MARRIAGE SUPPER.
[1:34:33] Is that right? We go to the marriage
[1:34:35] supper.
[1:34:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE MEANTIME, OUR BODIES WILL be
[1:34:40] changed.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; So, are we READY FOR THE FOR THE
[1:34:47] MARRIAGE?
[1:34:49] The bride has made us ready.
[1:34:52] THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB is come.
[1:34:56] Are we ready for marriage?
[1:34:58] When we ready for marriage,
[1:35:00] then we are ready for the wedding
[1:35:02] supper.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care how we feel.
[1:35:08] As you get older,
[1:35:11] many times your feelings
[1:35:14] are betraying you more.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You feel tired.
[1:35:20] You feel sick. You feel worried. You
[1:35:24] cannot handle things so good anymore.
[1:35:28] So don't trust your feelings.
[1:35:31] Trust what the Lord has done for you.
[1:35:34] Don't trust your feelings.
[1:35:36] Your feelings
[1:35:38] don't represent you before God.
[1:35:43] YOUR FEELINGS
[1:35:45] IS NOT PRESENTING you before God
[1:35:49] BECAUSE GOD IS NOT influenced
[1:35:53] by your feelings.
[1:35:56] SO YOU YOU'RE NOT PRESENTED BEFORE God
[1:36:00] in behalf of your feelings.
[1:36:03] YOU ARE PRESENTED BEFORE GOD.
[1:36:07] AND WHAT KIND OF attitude you have?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; What kind of attitude you have?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; we will see that a little later.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "Your attitude
[1:36:25] presents you before God,
[1:36:29] not your feelings.
[1:36:32] I'M SO HAPPY
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; THAT MY feelings
[1:36:35] don't represent me.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD THAT MY ATTITUDE REPRESENTS
[1:36:43] ME.
[1:36:46] SO GOD KNOWS WHAT I WANT TO DO. HE HE
[1:36:50] KNOWS MY HEART AND THAT REPRESENTS ME
[1:36:53] BEFORE HIM.
[1:36:55] That represents me before God.
[1:36:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; So as we speak uh ready for marriage
[1:37:06] WE WE ASK THE QUESTION ready for
[1:37:09] translation
[1:37:12] because AS WE ARE READY FOR THE marriage
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; and are we ready for the marriage?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE ALREADY.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; THE MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE ALREADY
[1:37:25] CHURCHMEN.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; The marriage takes place here on earth.
[1:37:36] YOU ARE UNITED RIGHT NOW.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR ATTITUDE.
[1:37:46] What do you do
[1:37:49] with what the messenger said about you
[1:37:54] and all that matters
[1:37:56] AS IT WAS WITH MARY? WHAT DID SHE SAY?
[1:38:00] And be to me according to your words.
[1:38:06] I DON'T CARE HOW SHE FELT. I DON'T KNOW
[1:38:10] HOW SHE FELT.
[1:38:12] I WILL ASK HER when I meet her how she
[1:38:16] would have felt.
[1:38:18] But it doesn't matter HOW YOU FEEL,
[1:38:21] IF YOU FEEL GOOD OR IF YOU DON'T FEEL
[1:38:24] GOOD.
[1:38:25] AMEN. Your attitude presents you before
[1:38:28] God.
[1:38:31] AND MARY SAID IN A VERY DIFFICULT
[1:38:34] SITUATION.
[1:38:36] She said IT BE TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR
[1:38:39] WORDS.
[1:38:42] HALLELUJAH. AND GOD HONORED THAT.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HONORED THAT.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's go to first Corinthians.
[1:38:53] We want to read a story. First
[1:38:54] Corinthians.

[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; the sixth chapter.
[1:39:12] Let's read that first.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; So that we really understand
[1:39:18] to lay a little background
[1:39:21] for what we want to say.
[1:39:23] KNOW YE NOT THAT UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL
[1:39:25] NOT inherit the kingdom of God? Be not
[1:39:28] deceived, neither fornicators, nor
[1:39:30] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[1:39:32] effeminates, nor abusers of themselves
[1:39:35] with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous,
[1:39:38] nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[1:39:40] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:39:43] of God.
[1:40:14] And [snorts] such were some of you, but
[1:40:17] ye are washed.
[1:40:18] But ye are sanctified, but you are
[1:40:20] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:23] and by the spirit of our God.
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; So we understand who shall inherit thee
[1:40:45] the kingdom.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And now this is now re this is now for
[1:40:50] believers.
[1:40:52] Amen. This is now for the true believers
[1:40:54] coming.
[1:40:57] Amen. You understand that?
[1:41:00] Amen. Amen. Only those shall inherit the
[1:41:03] kingdom.
[1:41:05] who are washed, who are sanctified,
[1:41:09] who are justified in the name of Jesus,
[1:41:12] and by the spirit of our God,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; only those
[1:41:17] shall inherit the kingdom.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. ARE YOU WASHED? ARE YOU
[1:41:24] WASHED? NOT ONLY BY THE WATER, BUT ARE
[1:41:28] YOU WASHED? BY THE BLOOD OF THE lamb
[1:41:33] sanctified.
[1:41:35] AMEN. AND ARE JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF
[1:41:37] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:41:40] Justified
[1:41:42] means you have never done it.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke 18.
[1:41:55] We want to read another
[1:41:58] because I needed to do that before
[1:42:02] to put a a good foundation down.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luke 18.
[1:42:08] This morning we want to go really as far
[1:42:11] as the Lord leads us.
[1:42:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And I know you see as much as you build
[1:42:19] a house,
[1:42:22] it's very important that the foundation
[1:42:24] is strong enough.
[1:42:27] is that right that we have a strong
[1:42:29] foundation where we build on
[1:42:32] because we are not following fables.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Okay. Luke 18. Let's read from 9 to 14.
[1:42:44] AND HE SPAKE THIS PARABLE unto a certain
[1:42:46] which trusted in themsel that they were
[1:42:49] righteous and despised others.
[1:42:54] Vers. Verse 9.
[1:43:11] You understand? Here were some they were
[1:43:14] trusted
[1:43:15] in themselves that they were righteous.
[1:43:22] And we have read in Revelation,
[1:43:25] the bride it was given unto her
[1:43:29] that she would clothe herself,
[1:43:32] which is the righteousness of the
[1:43:34] saints.
[1:43:37] But here were people
[1:43:39] that trusted in their own righteousness.
[1:43:43] I TRUST NO ONE HERE this morning
[1:43:47] trust in his own righteousness.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; It must be the righteousness of God.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Two men went up into the temple to pray.
[1:44:04] The one a Pharisee and the other a
[1:44:06] publican.
[1:44:12] And the Pharisees stood and prayed thus
[1:44:14] within himself. God, I thank thee that
[1:44:16] I'm not as the other men extortioners,
[1:44:19] unjust, adulterers, or even as this
[1:44:22] publican.
[1:44:41] I fast twice in the week. I give tithes
[1:44:44] of all that I possess.
[1:44:52] And the publican standing a far off
[1:44:54] would not lift up so much his eyes unto
[1:44:56] heaven, but smote upon his breast,
[1:44:58] saying, "God, be merciful to me a
[1:45:01] sinner.
[1:45:18] I tell you, this man WENT DOWN TO HIS
[1:45:20] HOUSE justified rather than the other.
[1:45:23] For everyone that exaltth himself shall
[1:45:26] be abased, and he that humbles himself
[1:45:28] shall be exalted.
[1:45:45] SO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS THIS PUBLICAN
[1:45:50] HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED.
[1:45:55] That's right. Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT?
[1:46:01] JUST BECAUSE HE HAD THE right attitude.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Oh church TO BE READY
[1:46:14] IS SO DIFFERENT THAN WE THINK.
[1:46:17] I ASK YOU A QUESTION. WAS THIS MAN, THIS
[1:46:21] PUBLICAN, was he ready to go home?
[1:46:27] This publican, HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED.
[1:46:32] He was ready to go home.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; COME ON, LET'S WAKE UP.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; The other man,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; the other man that felt good about
[1:46:43] himself
[1:46:46] and he prayed and he fasted,
[1:46:49] WAS HE READY TO GO HOME?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:46:53] That's right.
[1:46:58] I want to let that sink a LITTLE BIT
[1:47:01] BECAUSE THIS PUBLICAN
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT attitude
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; went home justified.
[1:47:14] Amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. DO
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND?
[1:47:22] I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FELT.
[1:47:24] I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS
[1:47:26] MIND.
[1:47:28] HE WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED
[1:47:31] ABOUT HIS LIFE, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
[1:47:34] MAN WENT HOME JUSTIFIED.
[1:47:40] [applause]
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Oh church TO BE READY
[1:47:48] SO DIFFERENT THAN we think.
[1:47:53] THAT'S WHY DON'T TRUST YOUR FEELING.
[1:47:56] IF YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, A CHILD OF GOD,
[1:48:00] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CANNOT
[1:48:03] MISS THE RAPTURE.
[1:48:06] You cannot MISS THE RAPTURE.
[1:48:09] REGARDLESS WHERE YOU GO THROUGH,
[1:48:12] REGARDLESS HOW DEEP YOU ARE, REGARDLESS
[1:48:14] HOW DOWN YOU ARE, YOU CANNOT MISS THE
[1:48:18] RAPTURE.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; What a what a day and hour we living in.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's take another scripture.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to James
[1:48:37] to James 5.
[1:48:40] Let's we want to read two verses
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and again as a scripture is beautiful.
[1:48:48] The scripture is so connected.
[1:48:51] Hallelujah. The scripture is so
[1:48:53] connected
[1:48:55] and I trust we we understand
[1:48:58] 40 different writers.
[1:49:02] 40 different writers
[1:49:08] wrote the Bible
[1:49:10] over the space
[1:49:16] of 1,500 years.
[1:49:21] That's right. Amen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And it's all connected.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; They had no headquarters.
[1:49:30] headquarter.
[1:49:34] Their headquarter
[1:49:36] was God himself.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:49:43] NOW HERE James comes.
[1:49:46] WATCH HOW JAMES COMES.
[1:49:48] AND WATCH HOW HE CONNECTED WITH THE OLD
[1:49:50] TESTAMENT.
[1:49:53] Let's read from 16 to 18.
[1:49:57] Confess your faults one to THE OTHER AND
[1:50:00] PRAY for one another that you may be
[1:50:03] healed.
[1:50:12] Now listen very carefully.
[1:50:14] THE EFFECTUAL
[1:50:17] FE FERENT PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS man
[1:50:19] avail much.
[1:50:29] Amen.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; The effect TO YOUR FAVORITE PRAYER OF A
[1:50:34] RIGHTEOUS MAN.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE READ THAT THE BRIDE WAS CLOTHED
[1:50:40] IN his righteousness.
[1:50:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THE PUBLICAN
[1:50:51] JUST BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
[1:50:54] went home justified.
[1:50:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER WAS CLOSED IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
[1:51:03] BUT HE BECAME CLOSED IN GOD'S
[1:51:04] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:51:08] BECAUSE JUSTIFY means
[1:51:11] you have never done it in the first
[1:51:13] PLACE
[1:51:15] AND ONLY THEN
[1:51:17] YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:51:19] YES, IT'S NOT YOUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS,
[1:51:23] BUT if he IF HE GIVES YOU HIS
[1:51:25] RIGHTEOUSNESS,
[1:51:28] THEN YOU HAVE NEVER DONE IT. YOU STAND
[1:51:30] RIGHTEOUS.
[1:51:32] IS IT RIGHT? NOBODY CAN BLAME YOU.
[1:51:36] NOBODY CAN BLAME YOU.
[1:51:38] THERE'S NO SIN UPON YOU. THE BLOOD OF
[1:51:41] JESUS CHRIST WASHED IT AWAY. WHITER THAN
[1:51:45] THE SNOW.
[1:51:48] THAT MEANS TO BE THAT MEANS TO BE REALLY
[1:51:50] JUSTIFIED.
[1:51:54] HALLELUJAH. AND ONLY A TRUE JUSTIFIED
[1:51:56] PERSON
[1:51:59] is closed in the righteousness of God.
[1:52:04] AND THE FEVER PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS man
[1:52:08] avail much.
[1:52:11] Listen what? Listen further.
[1:52:14] Verse 17.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Is it amazing? Listen,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I can't do this.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And I know it's it's still early and so
[1:52:23] you're awake, right?
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Watch how James
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; suddenly brings a character in.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Give it please again. 17
[1:52:36] Elias
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; WAS A MAN SUBJECT TO LIKE PASSIONS
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; AS we are.
[1:52:46] That means ELIJAH
[1:52:49] HAD THE same problems
[1:52:51] that you and I have.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; AND HE PRAYED EARNESTLY
[1:53:00] THAT IT MIGHT not rain
[1:53:03] AND IT RAINED NOT ON THE EARTH BY THE
[1:53:06] space
[1:53:09] of 3 years and 6 months.
[1:53:14] THE PRAYER
[1:53:16] OF A righteous man, THE FEVER PRAYER,
[1:53:21] not the symbolic prayer,
[1:53:25] the fever prayer
[1:53:27] of a righteous man avail much.
[1:53:33] LOOK HOW IT'S ALL CONNECTED.
[1:53:37] THAT MAN
[1:53:39] PUBLICAN
[1:53:40] JUST WITH THE RIGHT attitude
[1:53:44] went home justified.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; We see that a little later.
[1:53:50] VERY AMAZING.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. VERY AMAZING.
[1:53:54] SO VERY IMPORTANT
[1:53:57] IS YOUR ATTITUDE.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; YOUR ATTITUDE
[1:54:03] PRESENTS you
[1:54:05] before God.
[1:54:07] Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; What attitude do we take this afternoon
[1:54:12] or this morning?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Luke 18
[1:54:21] shows us a MAN
[1:54:23] THAT WALKTH OUT righteous
[1:54:27] ready for rapture.
[1:54:37] Hallelujah.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say AMEN TO THAT?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; YOU WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE?
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ELECT SEAT
[1:54:55] THAT WOULD COME IN? HOW MUCH TIME HE
[1:54:59] WILL have
[1:55:01] to prove that he's worthy?
[1:55:07] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; SHALL WE WAIT ANOTHER 10 YEARS
[1:55:13] so now he can prove
[1:55:15] that he's worthy?
[1:55:18] WHEN THE LAST ONE COMES IN,
[1:55:21] WHEN THE LAST ONE COMES IN, IT DOESN'T
[1:55:24] TAKE VERY LONG.
[1:55:27] REMEMBER,
[1:55:28] as we go there a little later,
[1:55:31] 2,000 years ago,
[1:55:34] there was already a last one.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; You know him. HE WAS THAT MAN
[1:55:46] THAT WAS HANGING AT THE CROSS.
[1:55:50] AMEN.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; There was a man. How do you call him?
[1:55:54] We call him the sheer.
[1:55:57] THERE THERE IS THAT MAN THAT WAS HANGING
[1:55:58] AT the cross.
[1:56:00] With Jesus together,
[1:56:03] is that right? With Jesus together,
[1:56:06] there was someone hanging with him.
[1:56:10] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; And one said, "HEY, IF YOU ARE THE SON
[1:56:16] OF GOD,
[1:56:17] HELP US DO SOMETHING. HELP US FROM THE
[1:56:21] CROSS. DO IT YOURSELF.
[1:56:25] AMEN.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; The other one said
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; what?
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; The other one said, "Hey,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; we deserved our punishment.
[1:56:36] We have done wrong in our life.
[1:56:39] We have deserved our punishment.
[1:56:42] But this man has done nothing wrong.
[1:56:45] What is it
[1:56:48] all about attitude?"
[1:56:51] And then he is asking,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; he's asking,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; he's asking, "Can I find grace?
[1:57:01] Remember me.
[1:57:03] Remember me when you come and do YOUR
[1:57:06] KINGDOM?"
[1:57:08] JESUS TURNED AROUND AND HE SAID, "TODAY.
[1:57:12] Today
[1:57:14] you will be with me
[1:57:16] in paradise."
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:57:20] WHAT DID THIS MAN DO
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; to go?
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to him,
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE LAST ONE,
[1:57:38] THE LAST [screaming] ONE OF THE OLD
[1:57:40] DISPENSATION.
[1:57:43] CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? BECAUSE JESUS TOLD
[1:57:46] HIM, "Today
[1:57:49] you will be with me in paradise,
[1:57:53] and I come today."
[1:57:57] Amen.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GO DOWN TO PARADISE,
[1:58:08] YOU GO WITH ME TO PARADISE.
[1:58:12] AND YOU COME TODAY OUT OF PARADISE.
[1:58:17] COME ON CHURCH.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Can we believe that?
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS
[1:58:26] THAT WAS IN PARADISE
[1:58:29] WHO CAME OUT OF PARADISE.
[1:58:32] IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT RIGHT? SO WHAT
[1:58:35] DID DID THIS MAN DO
[1:58:38] TO COME AND GO INTO PARADISE?
[1:58:41] AND ALLOW ME TO SAY
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; AND TO BE RAPTURED OUT OF PARADISE.
[1:58:46] WAS HE READY FOR RAPTURE?
[1:58:50] WAS HE READY FOR RAPTURE?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; YES, HE WAS. [screaming]
[1:58:55] JESUS TOLD HIM TODAY YOU WILL BE WITH ME
[1:58:59] IN PARADISE.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. LET'S GET RID OF OUR
[1:59:04] OWN IDEAS.
[1:59:06] WHAT IT means to be ready.
[1:59:09] THAT MAN WAS READY.
[1:59:11] HOW? JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE.
[1:59:15] JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; THAT MAN COULDN'T GO DOWN
[1:59:20] AND TO PAY ALL HIS DEATH.
[1:59:23] THE MAN HAD NO TIME ANYMORE TO GO HOME
[1:59:26] AND SAY SORRY TO ALL THE PEOPLE.
[1:59:29] JESUS TOLD HIM BECAUSE THAT MAN DIED
[1:59:33] IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE DIED,
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WENT INTO INTO A WRONG PLACE.
[1:59:40] HE WENT INTO INTO PARADISE.
[1:59:44] AND AS HIS MEN RUN INTO PARADISE,
[1:59:48] THAT MAN COULD SAY, "COME ON,
[1:59:52] I'M THE LAST ONE. YOU'RE COMING INTO
[1:59:54] PARADISE.
[1:59:56] PREPARE.
[1:59:59] PREPARE.
[2:00:00] HE'S COMING. BECAUSE HE TOLD ME, HE WILL
[2:00:04] BE WITH ME IN PARADISE."
[2:00:08] WHY DID JESUS WENT TO PARADISE?
[2:00:11] Why did Jesus went down to paradise?
[2:00:16] Why did Jesus go to paradise?
[2:00:18] Amen. To take the Old Testament saints
[2:00:23] out of paradise.
[2:00:25] Is that right?
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament saints
[2:00:30] because they were under the blood of
[2:00:32] bulls and goats
[2:00:34] and they died. Then they died. They went
[2:00:37] to a place
[2:00:39] called paradise.
[2:00:42] Amen.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; We are not going to paradise.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GO AND WE PASS, WHEN WE DIE,
[2:00:53] WE HAVE A BODY WAITING.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; We have a body waiting.
[2:00:58] We don't GO TO PARADISE.
[2:01:00] WE ARE GOING TO HEAVEN.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO HEAVEN. IN HEAVEN IS THE
[2:01:06] WORD.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THIS?
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE LAST ONE THAT CAME IN THE
[2:01:20] TIME OF JESUS.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; THE LAST ONE THAT ENTERED PARADISE.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LAST ONE TODAY?
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; WILL come into the fold. What? That will
[2:01:32] come into the fold. that will come into
[2:01:37] HOW LONG HOW MUCH TIME WILL HE HAVE.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; SO YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT YOUR WORKS
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; THAT MAKES you ready.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR WORK SHOULD BE there
[2:02:01] of an appreciation
[2:02:03] of what God has done for you.
[2:02:06] BUT YOUR WORKS,
[2:02:08] YOUR effort will never make you ready.
[2:02:13] NOT YOUR MONEY THAT YOU GIVE TO THE
[2:02:14] CHURCH
[2:02:16] MAKES YOU READY.
[2:02:18] NOTHING YOU CAN DO
[2:02:21] MAKES MAKES YOU READY. WHAT MAKES ME
[2:02:23] READY, BROTHER? JUST KEEP [screaming]
[2:02:26] THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
[2:02:30] JUST KEEP THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; TO SAY AMEN
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; TO ALL THAT GOD SAY?
[2:02:42] [applause]
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; SAY AMEN. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; SAY AMEN. REGARDLESS WHAT YOUR OWN MIND
[2:02:53] TELLS YOU.
[2:02:56] BECAUSE THE GREATEST BATTLE WE have
[2:03:00] is in our mind.
[2:03:03] That's where the greatest battle takes
[2:03:04] place in your mind.
[2:03:08] In your mind, the greatest battle takes
[2:03:10] place.
[2:03:13] Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; HERE IS SATAN AND God
[2:03:19] coming together.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Amen.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; AND HERE
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER GOES on
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; never lose the right kind of attitude.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Always say
[2:03:39] I am okay.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR
[2:03:48] BECAUSE YOU SHOULD go to the DOCTOR
[2:03:51] IF YOU ARE SICK.
[2:03:53] Why don't go to the doctor?
[2:03:56] BUT IF THE DO IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR,
[2:03:59] GO WITH ATTITUDE.
[2:04:01] I am healed already.
[2:04:06] GO WITH ATTITUDE. THE DOCTOR IS NOT
[2:04:09] HEALING YOU,
[2:04:11] BUT HE HELPS YOU
[2:04:13] ON THE WAY TO your healing.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; AND THAT MAN SAID,
[2:04:25] HE SAID THAT MAN SAID, "LORD, BE
[2:04:28] MERCIFUL
[2:04:30] FOR ME A SINNER."
[2:04:32] AND HE WENT HOME.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; HE WENT HOME JUSTIFIED.
[2:04:39] WHY? BECAUSE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
[2:04:44] YOU WILL NEVER BE WORTHY.
[2:04:48] YOU WILL NEVER BE WORTHY TO BE RAPTURED.
[2:04:52] AMEN. AMEN.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED YOU
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU were unworthy.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; GOD GOD'S LOVE
[2:05:05] IS SO different than human love.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; THE LAST THING THAT COMES DOWN
[2:05:13] CAPPING THE WHOLE THING off
[2:05:16] is divine love.
[2:05:20] Is that right? It's divine love.
[2:05:24] And we say that is it okay when I say
[2:05:27] amen.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:05:30] divine MOUTH
[2:05:33] GOD'S love
[2:05:35] is selective love.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; God loved you when you were still a
[2:05:41] sinner.
[2:05:47] Is it is that true?
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN YOU BECOME A BELIEVER
[2:05:53] GOD LOVES YOU.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; God
[2:06:03] can you not cannot love you more.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU more
[2:06:19] and he cannot LOVE YOU LESS.
[2:06:23] BECAUSE his love is elective.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE A SINNER,
[2:06:32] WHEN YOU COME OUT OF DENOMINATION,
[2:06:35] WHEN YOU WERE IN DENOMINATION,
[2:06:38] GOD LOVED YOU. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE
[2:06:42] SENT THE TRUTH your way
[2:06:45] THAT CHOSE HIS LOVE TO YOU.
[2:06:48] NOW, WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF DENIMATION,
[2:06:51] WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE WRONG THING,
[2:06:53] God didn't love you more.
[2:06:58] Human love
[2:07:00] knows,
[2:07:04] helio love
[2:07:08] knows more and less.
[2:07:12] Agap love
[2:07:15] DOES NOT KNOW MORE OR LESS.
[2:07:22] AS PARENTS
[2:07:24] we have we have felio love.
[2:07:27] THAT'S WHY WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE
[2:07:30] performing
[2:07:32] we love them more.
[2:07:34] When our CHILDREN DO MISTAKES
[2:07:37] BE HONEST.
[2:07:39] MANY TIMES YOU love them a little less.
[2:07:46] NOT SO GOD.
[2:07:50] Not God.
[2:07:52] God's [screaming] love.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU WERE A SINNER.
[2:08:00] HE LOVED YOU WHEN YOU BECAME A SAINT.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU MORE WHEN YOU BECOME
[2:08:08] A SAINT. AMEN.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU MORE
[2:08:14] BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S LOVE.
[2:08:17] GOD CANNOT LOVE YOU LESS.
[2:08:20] THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD DAY, WHEN
[2:08:24] YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, WHEN YOU FALL, GOD
[2:08:28] CANNOT LOVE you less.
[2:08:35] [applause]
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember
[2:08:39] our brother Brham, how the devil could
[2:08:42] get him
[2:08:44] because this mighty God
[2:08:48] was not unveiled.
[2:08:52] BUT THE MIGHTY GOD IS UNVEILED NOW.
[2:09:01] Remember when BROTHER RAM HAD THE
[2:09:03] DARKEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE?
[2:09:07] BECAUSE HE MADE A MISTAKE,
[2:09:10] RIGHT? HE DIDN'T GO WITH THE
[2:09:11] PENTECOSTALS.
[2:09:14] His wife died. His kids died.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; GOD EVEN CLOSED THE CURTAIN.
[2:09:27] COME ON. RIGHT. SO THERE CAN BE REALLY
[2:09:30] DARK MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:09:35] When you make mistakesh
[2:09:39] WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES,
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES TERRIBLE MISTAKES.
[2:09:46] AMEN.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; AND AS GOD WAS DRAWING THE CURTAIN,
[2:09:54] AMEN. I had many times in my life I had
[2:09:58] the feeling the impression
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; God pulled the curtain
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and it depressed me
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; because I thought God don't love me
[2:10:17] anymore
[2:10:21] till I found out
[2:10:23] that God cannot love me less. Remember
[2:10:27] [applause]
[2:10:32] brother Brandham said and the devil came
[2:10:35] to him
[2:10:37] AND ALL THE THINGS SATAN TOLD him
[2:10:41] was the truth.
[2:10:45] WHAT DO YOU DO
[2:10:47] IF Satan is telling you the truth?
[2:10:51] HE TOLD BROTHER BRANDHAM
[2:10:54] ALL YOUR LIFE YOU HAVE GIVEN
[2:10:56] EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU
[2:10:59] HAVE THIS AND GOD NOW DON'T LISTEN TO

[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; SO THE DEVIL
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; WAS TAKING THE TRUTH AND PUTTING HIM TO
[2:11:54] JESUS.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT IS ALSO WRITTEN.
[2:12:04] YES.
[2:12:05] IT'S ALSO TRUE
[2:12:08] THAT GOD LOVES ME.

[2:12:37] YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? THIS IS HOW JESUS
[2:12:40] WAS ANSWERING.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; HE COULDN'T SAY
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN is not the truth.
[2:12:54] Hallelujah. AND THAT WAS THE GREATEST
[2:12:56] TEMPTATION.
[2:13:00] GREATEST TEMPTATION
[2:13:02] IS WHEN WHEN SATAN COMES WITH TRUTH.
[2:13:09] OH YES,
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR GREAT BATTLE MIND.
[2:13:15] THE DEVIL TELLS YOU THE TRUTH
[2:13:18] ABOUT OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WRONG.

[2:13:23] MISTAKES.
[2:13:25] IS IT RIGHT AND THAT BATTLE IS RAGING IN
[2:13:27] YOUR HEAD

[2:13:36] AN ETERNAL TRUTH.

[2:13:53] Amen.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; AND WATCH HOW SATAN CAME TO BROTHER.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOLD HIM ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE
[2:14:02] TRUE.
[2:14:04] And then HE TOLD BROTHER RAN NOW EVEN
[2:14:06] GOD HAS PULLED [screaming] THE CURTAIN.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT LISTENING TO YOU.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS TRUE.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the end.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; We are in the end time.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; SATAN IS NOT TRYING TO TEMPT YOU.
[2:14:35] SATAN IS NOT TRYING TO TEMPT YOU
[2:14:38] with great lie,
[2:14:40] WITH AN OPEN LIE. HE'S NOT TEMPT YOU
[2:14:43] with drink and smoke,
[2:14:47] BUT HE'S TEMPTING YOU WITH A PART OF THE
[2:14:50] TRUTH.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; And listen what brother Brandham said.
[2:15:01] our church. We should be on our on our
[2:15:04] chairs right now.
[2:15:07] YOU KNOW WHY? AT THAT TIME,
[2:15:11] at that time,
[2:15:13] God had not unveiled himself completely.
[2:15:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T KNOW
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE love of God.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT KNOW
[2:15:30] THAT GOD'S LOVE
[2:15:33] is elective.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY SATAN COULD TELL HIM, "GOD,
[2:15:42] DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE."
[2:15:46] And this nearly
[2:15:48] LED BROTHER RENHAM TO SUICIDE.
[2:15:52] WHEN THE DEVIL CAN TELL YOU,
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; "BROTHER RENHAM SAID, SATAN COULDN'T
[2:15:58] tell me.
[2:15:59] that there is no God. He said because I
[2:16:02] know him.
[2:16:04] BUT HE COULD TELL ME THAT GOD DON'T LOVE
[2:16:06] ME ANYMORE.
[2:16:09] IF THE DEVIL
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; CAN TELL YOU THAT GOD DON'T LOVE you
[2:16:13] anymore,
[2:16:15] he has won.
[2:16:18] He has the victory.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; AND IT PULLS YOU MUCH DAM DOWN IN
[2:16:26] DEPRESSION.
[2:16:30] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON BELIEVED
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; THE LIE [screaming]
[2:16:34] OF THE DEVIL.
[2:16:38] AMEN.
[2:16:40] AH.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; and then
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; as the Lord God is unveiling himself,
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; it came out
[2:16:58] that God's love,
[2:17:00] church age book
[2:17:02] is elective.
[2:17:08] Even if he pulls the curtain,
[2:17:13] even if he chastise you,
[2:17:18] even that
[2:17:22] even that
[2:17:26] it's love
[2:17:28] can never change.
[2:17:33] I want to say that again.
[2:17:39] Oh my my my my my my
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; God loves you
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; when you were a sinner
[2:17:50] because he loved you.
[2:17:53] He saved you.
[2:17:55] You know that
[2:17:58] because you are saved
[2:18:00] by grace
[2:18:02] according to scripture
[2:18:05] through faith
[2:18:07] and that not of your own.
[2:18:10] It is a gift of God.
[2:18:15] That faith that you need to be saved
[2:18:19] is a gift of God.
[2:18:23] BUT
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAVED BY GRACE.
[2:18:27] WHAT IS GRACE?
[2:18:29] WHAT IS GRACE? BROTHER RANDOM SAID WHEN
[2:18:33] LOVE [screaming] IS PROJECTED,
[2:18:37] GRACE TAKES OVER.
[2:18:41] THAT'S WHY I CAN SAY YOU ARE SAVED
[2:18:45] BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; TO THE elect
[2:18:57] and THEN YOU ARE SAVED.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW BY GRACE,
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; GRACE GOES BACK TO BEFORE EDEN WAS
[2:19:05] THERE.
[2:19:10] WHEN WAS THE [screaming] LAMB SLAIN?
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[2:19:22] FOR WHOM THE LAMB WAS SLAIN.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; FOR ALL THOSE
[2:19:29] THAT GOD LOVES
[2:19:32] FOR THE WORLD, [screaming]
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD?
[2:19:40] You're with me?
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; JOHN 3:16.
[2:19:44] SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD
[2:19:47] THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON?
[2:19:51] WHAT KIND OF WORLD GOD IS LOVING?
[2:19:55] JOHN SAID,
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; JOHN SAID THE BELOVED DISCIPLE,
[2:20:01] HE SAID, CHILDREN, IF YOU LOVE THE
[2:20:04] WORLD, THE LOVE OF GOD IS not in you.
[2:20:09] BUT JOHN 3:16,
[2:20:11] HE SAID, "SO HAS GOD LOVED THE WORLD."
[2:20:15] WHAT WORLD IS GOD LOVING?
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; THAT WORLD THAT WAS THERE BEFORE THIS
[2:20:23] world was formed.
[2:20:26] [applause]
[2:20:28] Oh my. If you could go back,
[2:20:31] we would make clear
[2:20:34] that God's world
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; is his people.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:20:46] Let's let's quickly go to the Garden of
[2:20:49] Eden
[2:20:51] to make that more clear.
[2:20:53] Remember when Adam and Eve had fallen,
[2:20:57] they fell in God's Eden.
[2:21:00] We are here in Satan's Eden.
[2:21:05] They they were falling in God's Eden
[2:21:09] in a beautiful environment.
[2:21:12] NO TELEVISION, NO CELL PHONE, NOTHING.
[2:21:18] IT WAS IT WAS CALLED THE ATMOSPHERE OF
[2:21:20] INNOCENCE.
[2:21:23] They were NAKED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW.
[2:21:29] IN THAT KIND OF CONDITION,
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; ADAM AND Eve fell.
[2:21:38] My my MY MY NOW WE ARE IN SATAN'S EDEN.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT CALLED INNOCENT.
[2:21:48] THIS CONDITION CANNOT BE CALLED
[2:21:50] INNOCENT.
[2:21:52] THIS CONDITION CAN BE CALLED CRAZY,
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; BLIND, NAKED, AND THEY DON'T KNOW.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Is it right?
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NAKED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW.
[2:22:06] IN LAIA, THEY ARE NAKED AND THEY DON'T
[2:22:08] KNOW.
[2:22:10] MAN WAS INNOCENT.
[2:22:13] God's innocence.
[2:22:18] HERE IS SATAN'S PERVERSION.
[2:22:24] HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Just to show you where we are living,
[2:22:36] what is bombarding your mind.
[2:22:41] COME ON
[2:22:43] NOW. IN GOD'S Eden
[2:22:46] with Adam, when Adam and Eve his wife
[2:22:48] were fallen,
[2:22:54] WHAT DID GOD DO AS THE FIRST ACT?
[2:23:01] They was dressed in fig leaves.
[2:23:06] Is that right? What did God do? He
[2:23:09] brought his skin.
[2:23:14] Is it right? He brought his skin.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS STANDS FOR?
[2:23:19] GOD'S GRACE.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, just stay shortly with me.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Why did God brought a skin out for Adam
[2:23:32] and Eve?
[2:23:36] Pointing to Calvary
[2:23:38] that the lamb would die.
[2:23:43] WHY DID JESUS CHRIST DIE AT CALVARY?
[2:23:46] BECAUSE HE LOVED THE WORLD.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; I go a step further.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; You think God felt sorry for Adam and
[2:24:00] Eve?
[2:24:08] You think God was now afraid
[2:24:12] his two children
[2:24:14] would go to hell.
[2:24:21] When was the lamb slain?
[2:24:24] Before the foundation of THE WORLD.
[2:24:27] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[2:24:30] there was no place for hell.
[2:24:35] Hell is not eternal.
[2:24:37] It has a beginning, it has an end.
[2:24:41] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. HELL
[2:24:43] IS NOT ETERNAL.
[2:24:45] IT WAS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS
[2:24:47] ANGELS.
[2:24:50] YOU UNDERSTAND?
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; WHEN IN EDEN, HE BROUGHT A LAMB.
[2:24:55] THE LAMB WAS SLAIN
[2:24:58] IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[2:25:00] WORLD.
[2:25:02] THE LAMB WAS SLAIN
[2:25:05] BECAUSE OF GOD'S GRACE.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S GRACE LOOKS TO PREDESTINATION.
[2:25:12] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU UNDERSTAND?
[2:25:15] THERE WAS NO hell in view yet.
[2:25:20] Amen.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Now when God comes now
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; and saves you
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden,
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; if he saves you and you can say like
[2:25:35] Paul,
[2:25:39] you can say like Paul,
[2:25:41] I'm saved by grace.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Can we say that?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; I'm saved by grace.
[2:25:51] You're not saved
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; because God feels pity for you.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; I think it that doesn't really hit
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; IN GARDEN OF EDEN AND GOD BROUGHT FORTH
[2:26:07] A LAMB
[2:26:09] SHOWING THAT CALVARY WOULD COME.
[2:26:12] BUT THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE
[2:26:14] FOUNDATION.
[2:26:17] GOD WAS NOT AFRAID
[2:26:19] THAT HIS CHILDREN WOULD GO TO HELL.
[2:26:24] SO WHEN GOD SAVES YOU,
[2:26:26] HE FEELS NO PITY FOR YOU.
[2:26:31] HE'S NOT THINKING, "IF I DON'T SAVE
[2:26:33] THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO HELL.
[2:26:40] When God saves you
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; by grace,
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; he saves you because he has a plan for
[2:26:47] you.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. THAT'S WHY HE THAT'S
[2:26:54] WHY HE BROUGHT A LAMB SKIN TO ADAM AND
[2:26:55] Eve
[2:26:58] because HE HAD A PLAN OF REDEMPTION.
[2:27:01] HE SAID, "I BRING THAT LAMB SO YOU CAN
[2:27:04] COME BACK
[2:27:06] TO WHERE YOU FELL FROM."
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE LAMB WAS SLAIN
[2:27:15] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[2:27:18] SO THAT WE COULD COME BACK TO WHERE WE
[2:27:21] WHAT WE WAS
[2:27:23] BEFORE THIS EARTH BEGAN.
[2:27:26] THAT'S WHY HE DIED AT CALVARY. THAT'S
[2:27:28] WHY HE SHED THE BLOOD. [screaming]
[2:27:30] MESSIAH.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; BLESS.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; And watch very carefully.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We go. We go slowly. But
[2:27:54] just let me deal for a few minutes
[2:27:57] on the importance of attitude.
[2:28:08] Brother Ram said the message Balamin
[2:28:10] Gilead.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said
[2:28:21] when the rapture comes,
[2:28:25] you ready?
[2:28:27] He said it will be a day
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; that you will do
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; your daily routine.
[2:28:38] Amen.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily you are in church.
[2:28:49] We don't know.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; It can be.
[2:28:57] Well,
[2:28:59] can you imagine we having now church
[2:29:02] Sunday morning
[2:29:05] in Australia?
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; It is already Sunday night. They're
[2:29:08] sleeping already.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; We are in church.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; They are not in church anymore.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:29:22] In Germany,
[2:29:23] the people are coming to church now.
[2:29:27] In my church in Germany, they're just
[2:29:30] singing the songs. Now,
[2:29:34] in Germany, YOU GET THAT. WE ARE IN
[2:29:37] CHURCH RIGHT NOW. I HAVE A GOOD BROTHER
[2:29:39] IN AUSTRALIA.
[2:29:42] IF I PHONE HIM NOW, I DON'T GET him
[2:29:45] because he's sleeping.
[2:29:50] IN AUSTRALIA IS IT'S ALREADY NIGHT.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS,
[2:29:57] YOU MIGHT BE IN CHURCH
[2:29:59] OR YOU MIGHT BE IN BED,
[2:30:02] YOU MIGHT BE SLEEPING, YOU MIGHT BE
[2:30:04] WORKING.
[2:30:07] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THE RAPTURE
[2:30:10] WILL COME AS A DAILY ROUTINE.
[2:30:19] COME ON.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE DENOMINATIONS
[2:30:23] TAUGHT US?
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE DENOMINATIONS CONFUSED US?
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE WILL BE LIKE THIS.
[2:30:33] THEN ON WHATSAPP WHATSAPP
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; THERE COME a big news
[2:30:44] maybe YOUR WHATSAPP IS NOT workings
[2:30:53] what I WANT TO SAY IS
[2:30:57] THE RAPTURE
[2:30:59] DOES NOT DEPEND ON HOW YOU FEEL
[2:31:03] THE RAPTURE
[2:31:05] CONDITION
[2:31:07] DOES NOT DEPEND.
[2:31:09] IF YOU ARE JUST SINGING,
[2:31:12] IF YOU'RE JUST SAYING AMEN,
[2:31:14] EVEN IF YOU SLEEP, [screaming]
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL KNOW EXACTLY
[2:31:20] WHERE TO GO TO,
[2:31:23] THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL KNOW EXACTLY
[2:31:27] WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO.
[2:31:30] REMEMBER
[2:31:32] THE BIBLE SAID WHEN THE DEAD IN CHRIST,
[2:31:36] THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS
[2:31:39] ROSE, THEY APPEARED
[2:31:43] TO many [screaming]
[2:31:47] to whom they appeared
[2:31:50] to the believers.
[2:31:52] NO, I I JUST STAY a few minutes.
[2:31:56] REGARDLESS
[2:31:58] OF HOW THEY FELT,
[2:32:00] REMEMBER THE CRUCIFIXION JUST TOOK
[2:32:03] PLACE.
[2:32:05] EVERYBODY WAS HIDING.
[2:32:08] EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID. IS THAT RIGHT?
[2:32:12] THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHURCH.
[2:32:16] THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHURCH.
[2:32:19] EVERYONE WAS HIDING
[2:32:21] BECAUSE THEY CRUCIFIED JESUS.
[2:32:24] THE PERSECUTION WAS ON.
[2:32:26] Is that right?
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS, THE
[2:32:30] BIBLE SAID, THERE APPEARED TO MANY.
[2:32:37] My my my my YOU
[2:32:42] WERE NOT WAITING. THEY WERE NOT WAITING
[2:32:45] TO COME.
[2:32:48] They were coming.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; that we get out of
[2:33:01] our denominational
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; understanding.
[2:33:08] Hallelujah.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Because it will not be like this.
[2:33:18] You know how how how the people had
[2:33:20] their impression
[2:33:22] 2,000 years ago
[2:33:25] as the Bible would say.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; AND THE THE DISCIPLES SETS THE
[2:33:30] impression
[2:33:32] when John and he will sweep
[2:33:36] THAT MESSIAH
[2:33:38] WHEN HE COMES HE WILL CLEAN THE SYSTEM.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; AND HERE HE WAS KILLED BY THE SYSTEM.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; So never never depend on your feelings.
[2:34:00] Always keep the right attitude.
[2:34:05] Amen.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are with me.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; So when he brought a lamb in Eden,
[2:34:15] It was not to save them from hell.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; It was to bring them back.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; When God saves you,
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; when God saves you, he does not only
[2:34:34] save you
[2:34:36] from hell.
[2:34:39] He saves you because he has a purpose
[2:34:42] for you.
[2:34:45] That's the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:34:48] THAT'S WHY BROTHER ADAM SAYS YOU ARE NOT
[2:34:51] SAVED ON ANY DAY.
[2:34:54] YOU WERE ALWAYS SAVED.
[2:34:57] JUST you didn't know that.
[2:34:59] BUT ONE DAY HE SHOWED YOU AT THE END OF
[2:35:02] THE DAY YOU WERE NEVER LOST.
[2:35:06] YOU WERE ALWAYS A SEED.
[2:35:08] YOU WERE ALWAYS HIM.
[2:35:12] HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; WERE THEY READY FOR RAPTURE
[2:35:27] 2,000 YEARS AGO?
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; YES, THEY WERE.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT TIME FOR THE RAPTURE.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; It was not time for the rapture.
[2:35:39] THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS
[2:35:42] THEY CAME FROM paradise
[2:35:44] and they WERE THEY WAS TRANSFERRED INTO
[2:35:47] A place
[2:35:49] but we know where they are today.
[2:35:52] Is that right?
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Waiting for us.
[2:35:56] IS THAT RIGHT? WERE THEY READY?
[2:36:00] NOW THOSE IN JERUSALEM
[2:36:02] WERE THEY READY?
[2:36:05] YES.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT THE TIME FOR THE RAPTURE.
[2:36:10] BUT THEY WERE READY BECAUSE THE THE OLD
[2:36:13] TESTAMENT SAINTS CAME TO THEM.
[2:36:18] You're with me. [applause] SO YOUR
[2:36:21] READINESS
[2:36:23] DOESN'T DEPEND OF HOW READY YOU FEEL,
[2:36:27] YOUR READINESS,
[2:36:29] EVEN IF THERE'S AN ANXIETY ATTACK ON
[2:36:31] YOU.
[2:36:35] UHHUH.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; OH, we will go there in a few minutes.
[2:36:40] You will be shocked.
[2:36:44] Surprised.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my
[2:36:55] hallelujah.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Now Eve
[2:37:03] was the right womb.
[2:37:09] and she received the wrong seat
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; and the result was
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Kane.
[2:37:22] Is that okay?
[2:37:27] Right womb
[2:37:29] seat.
[2:37:36] Is that right?
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; Cain was the result.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Now, Hagga
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; was the wrong woman
[2:37:55] and the right seat.
[2:38:05] What was the result?
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Was Ish seed of Abraham?
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. [laughter]
[2:38:25] So Eve the right womb the wrong seed.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; HAGAR THE WRONG WOMB THE RIGHT SEAT.
[2:38:36] SARAH,
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; the right womb
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; and the right seat.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; But watch very careful.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; What came out?
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Isaac.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; But Isaac
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; died.
[2:39:02] Isaac died.
[2:39:04] So she brought forth
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; a natural man
[2:39:12] a good natural man.
[2:39:20] You will you will understand
[2:39:23] why the prophet in the church ages
[2:39:27] he would let us know the church age book
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; speaking about elective love.
[2:39:35] speaking about pick up the pen and
[2:39:37] write.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Why? He would say the word
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; is in the bride
[2:39:44] as it was in Mary.
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; Why not Sarah?
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE difference
[2:39:59] between Sarah and Mary?
[2:40:02] Amen.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; Sarah had the right womb,
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; received the RIGHT SEAT.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; MARY WAS the right womb
[2:40:14] received the right seat.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; What was the difference?
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; The attitude.
[2:40:23] [applause]
[2:40:26] Hallelujah.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just the attitude.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; WHAT ATTITUDE SARAH HAD?
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; ME, an old woman.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; ME, A 2,000Y OLD CHURCH.
[2:40:48] ME, a human being.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; What did Mary say?
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; IT BE TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:41:03] [applause]
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; So you understand.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; That's actually too much to it.
[2:41:29] As as we speak of rapture,
[2:41:33] as we speak of the rapture now and the
[2:41:36] rapture condition,
[2:41:41] I thought,
[2:41:43] it would be very good
[2:41:45] to really to look very close
[2:41:49] to the characters of the Bible
[2:41:53] who they were
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; and what was the secret.
[2:41:59] of them being raptured.
[2:42:02] of them being raptured.
[2:42:04] As the prophet said, there's three
[2:42:07] raptures in the Old Testament
[2:42:10] and three in the new.
[2:42:14] Is that right? How many raptures did
[2:42:17] that already taken place?
[2:42:21] Four.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Raptures took already place. Is that is
[2:42:26] that right?
[2:42:28] two is still waiting
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; which is the rapture of the bride of
[2:42:33] Christ.
[2:42:35] Amen.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; And
[2:42:37] you know what the sixth rapture is?
[2:42:42] SIXTH RAPTURE
[2:42:43] IS THE TWO witnesses
[2:42:46] Moses and Elijah.
[2:42:50] Maybe we start with them.
[2:42:56] It didn't happen.
[2:42:59] But we know according to the Bible
[2:43:02] what will happen.
[2:43:04] AND WE ALSO KNOW EXACTLY
[2:43:07] ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE
[2:43:09] WHAT HAPPENS IN our rapture
[2:43:14] because brother BRANDON
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; TOOK PSALM 27.
[2:43:19] He took Psalm 27
[2:43:28] AND SHOWED
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS WILL BE THE CONDITION WHEN the
[2:43:32] rapture takes place
[2:43:36] IN A TIME
[2:43:39] OF great trouble.
[2:43:42] HE SHALL HIDE ME
[2:43:44] IN THE SECRETS
[2:43:47] OF HIS TABERNACLE.
[2:43:50] SO, BROTHER TOLD US ALREADY THAT OUR
[2:43:53] RAPTURE WILL happen in a time of great
[2:43:57] trouble.
[2:43:59] Amen.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; How do you feel in great trouble?
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T BE BETRAYED BY YOUR FEELINGS.
[2:44:22] Let let's start with the last ones.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us
[2:44:27] that the system
[2:44:29] they will do great signs and wonders.
[2:44:33] IS THAT RIGHT? FINALLY,
[2:44:36] they get killed.
[2:44:39] HOW LONG DO THEY LAY DEAD IN THE
[2:44:41] STREETS?
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; Three days.
[2:44:47] killed
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; by the beast.
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:44:58] are they ready for rapture?
[2:45:04] Are they ready for rapture?
[2:45:07] WHEN THEY LAY [screaming] DEAD IN THE
[2:45:09] STREETS,
[2:45:10] THE BIBLE SAID THEY WILL LAY THREE DAYS
[2:45:14] DEAD IN JERUSALEM.
[2:45:26] AND then they are raptured.
[2:45:37] Amen.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; I will ask them
[2:45:40] when I meet them how how they have felt.
[2:45:48] How do you feel when you get killed?
[2:45:52] [laughter]
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; When you get COME ON. THEY GET KILLED by
[2:45:56] the system. Is that right?
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; Are they ready for rapture?
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Great attitude, brother.
[2:46:13] Amen.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you,
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; if the if Satan comes
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; and he's trying to make you afraid
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; because of your sick
[2:46:31] and when you are sick, you are down.
[2:46:36] Is that right?
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, you are down.
[2:46:41] You don't feel hallelujah.
[2:46:43] Hallelujah.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; IN THE GOOD DAYS,
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; PRAISE HIS NAME.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; IN THE BAD DAYS, DO THE SAME.
[2:46:57] [applause]
[2:46:57] You understand?
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR FEELINGS
[2:47:02] total different.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:07] CAN YOU ONCE AGAIN MOSES AND ELIJAH
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; THEY GET killed
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; which is not nice.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; THEY LAY FOR THREE DAYS.
[2:47:25] THE WHOLE WORLD THEY CELEBRATE A BIG
[2:47:28] feast
[2:47:32] and after three days
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; they're raising
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; in a rapture
[2:47:42] what
[2:47:44] I can get killed
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; and still rapture ready.
[2:47:51] Amen.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; So if Satan wants to scare you,
[2:47:58] you are sick,
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE NO FACE TO FOR HEALING, HOW CAN
[2:48:03] YOU GO IN THE RAPTURE?
[2:48:09] [laughter]
[2:48:10] Ah yes, come on church.
[2:48:14] THIS IS WHAT IS GOING IN YOUR HEAD.
[2:48:18] If I WANT TO BE BODY CHANGED,
[2:48:21] if I want to have a body change,
[2:48:24] please must have faith for my body.
[2:48:31] Is it not what THE PROPHET SAID?
[2:48:34] AND WHAT SATAN IS USING?
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; Is it okay when I go there?
[2:48:46] Church, WE ARE FIGHTING THE GREATEST
[2:48:48] BATTLE TODAY.
[2:48:51] We have a brother right now in our
[2:48:52] church.
[2:48:54] He's laying in hospital and they found
[2:48:57] out a cancer
[2:48:59] and he's going through a terrible time.
[2:49:02] Sometimes he's crying at the hospital.
[2:49:05] Sometimes he's begging. Some cannot
[2:49:08] understand.
[2:49:09] Sometimes he's just hallucinating
[2:49:12] because of the medication.
[2:49:17] Is he rapture ready?
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; When Satan is trying to scare you,
[2:49:39] said, "You are sick.
[2:49:42] You will die."
[2:49:44] Tell him, "I'm a believer."
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; And I don't die with the sickness.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; I die when my time has come.
[2:49:59] Did Elisha
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Elisha
[2:50:05] Elisha
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; type of the church
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; the the follower of Elijah.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Elijah was raptured.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Elijah
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; died with his sickness.
[2:50:28] Read your read your Bible.
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; WAS ELISHA rapture ready?
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; Had the quickening power.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN HAVE THE QUICKENING POWER
[2:50:46] AND DIE WITH THE SICKNESS.
[2:50:52] Yes sir.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; Is it right?
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; Because after he had gone,
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; they put a dead soldier on his body.
[2:51:08] And brother said, "Elijah had so many
[2:51:11] quickening, so much quickening power
[2:51:16] EVEN IN HIS DEAD BONES
[2:51:19] THAT WHEN THEY PUT A DEAD SOLDIER ON
[2:51:21] TOP,
[2:51:23] THE DEAD JOSEPH JUMPED OUT OF THE
[2:51:24] GRAVE."
[2:51:27] BECAUSE ELIJAH
[2:51:29] HAD THE QUICKENING power
[2:51:33] to be raptured
[2:51:36] AND HE DIED WITH A SICKNESS.
[2:51:43] HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; SO TO BE RAPTURE READY,
[2:51:50] TO BE MARRIAGE READY
[2:51:52] IS SO DIFFERENT than
[2:51:57] are we ready?
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You not don't look to a feeling
[2:52:03] now.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; YOU LOOK TO THE PROMISE. WE LOOK TO THE
[2:52:08] PROMISE FOR THE BRIDE HAS PREPARED
[2:52:12] HERSELF.
[2:52:14] SHE took she took what was granted to
[2:52:18] her.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; THE RIGHTEOUSNESS
[2:52:23] of the saints.
[2:52:26] [cheering]
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:52:30] Do you understand that chose the bride?
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; You need the right kind of attitude
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; to be dressed proper.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; You need the right attitude
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; to be dressed proper.
[2:52:58] Is that right?
[2:53:00] Uhhuh.
[2:53:02] If he puts on you
[2:53:06] his righteousness.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; Will you receive it?
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; So as we are closing,
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; may we take only one more example.
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; We could go to Jesus.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; We could go to Enoch.
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Enoch was raptured, right?
[2:53:34] Enoch was raptured, right?
[2:53:37] Was the first rapture in the Old
[2:53:38] Testament.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; Who was else raptured?
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Do you remember? We have read James.
[2:53:51] We have read James.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; James 5
[2:53:56] when it and James
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; actually speaking
[2:54:01] of someone
[2:54:04] WAS LIKE SAME KIND OF PASSION AS WE ARE.
[2:54:11] HE'S SPEAKING OF THE THE PRAYER OF A
[2:54:13] RIGHTEOUS MAN.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; And then HE SAID ELIJAH
[2:54:19] WAS A man of like passion.
[2:54:23] And then he prayed
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; and Elijah
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; went in a in the rapture.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; With this we are closing
[2:54:35] because I found it very beautiful
[2:54:38] the condition he was in
[2:54:42] the day he was raptured.
[2:54:45] And you will be amazed.
[2:54:47] And it makes clear
[2:54:50] attitude
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; makes a difference.
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:00] [applause]
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; Just have the right kind of attitude.
[2:55:05] Amen.
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; There was a man once, an old negro, an
[2:55:08] old colored man.
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; He came one morning to church.
[2:55:16] It happened not long ago, maybe 50, 60
[2:55:18] years ago.
[2:55:20] He came one morning to church,
[2:55:23] a group like this group,
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; a group like this group.
[2:55:29] And he came to church as you came to
[2:55:32] church. And when he came TO CHURCH, THE
[2:55:35] WHOLE CHURCH WAS UPSIDE DOWN.
[2:55:39] People were crying. People were crying.
[2:55:43] PEOPLE WERE PRAYING. People were were
[2:55:46] were a little bit nervous
[2:55:49] and that old fellow said, "Hey,
[2:55:52] what's going on here?"
[2:55:55] And somebody rose and said, "Oh,
[2:55:58] the news came. The rapture has taken
[2:56:00] place
[2:56:03] and we are left behind.
[2:56:06] Now we cry AND WE PRAY. WE DON'T KNOW
[2:56:08] WHAT TO DO."
[2:56:13] The old fellow said
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; that's not possible.
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; He said BUT THERE WAS A MAN THAT HE HAD
[2:56:24] A you know you know they had a prophecy
[2:56:26] and a vision and a dream and whatever
[2:56:28] whatever
[2:56:32] witness is proof that THIS IS THE TRUTH.
[2:56:36] THE RAPTURE HAS TAKEN PLACE.
[2:56:41] The brother said,
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; "That's not possible."
[2:56:47] He said, "BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW?"
[2:56:51] HE SAID, "I spoke to him this morning
[2:56:57] and he never said anything about it."
[2:57:04] So you must be wrong.
[2:57:09] That man
[2:57:11] had a right attitude.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; HE BELIEVED
[2:57:17] what God said about him.
[2:57:20] AND IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF
[2:57:21] ATTITUDE,
[2:57:23] YOU BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT YOU
[2:57:26] THAT THE RAPTURE CANNOT GO
[2:57:28] WITHOUT YOU. THAT YOU ARE SAVED
[2:57:31] [screaming] FOR A PURPOSE.
[2:57:33] I HAVE A PURPOSE.
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE RAPTURE.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT WAITING FOR FAITH.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:57:50] because THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF
[2:57:51] FAITH.
[2:57:53] THIS IS A PERSONAL FAITH.
[2:57:58] Normally we thought
[2:58:01] faith cometh by hearing
[2:58:05] which the Bible said.
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; But be honest. Faith is not coming to
[2:58:11] you.
[2:58:13] You have already faith.
[2:58:17] That faith comes to you
[2:58:20] means it's quickened.
[2:58:23] So the hearing of the word
[2:58:27] quickens,
[2:58:29] THAT FAITH
[2:58:31] THAT you are.
[2:58:34] &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO SAY CLEAR,
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; NOT THAT FAITH WHAT YOU HAVE,
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT FAITH WHO YOU ARE.
[2:58:46] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that
[2:58:55] Elijah
[2:58:57] did a lot of miracles,
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; but Elijah
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; did more.
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; Who was raptured?
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; So if the mount of miracles
[2:59:20] shows that we are ready for rapture,
[2:59:24] It should be Elisha.
[2:59:33] &gt;&gt; Very simple, right?
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; Once again,
[2:59:38] &gt;&gt; did Elisha did as double as much as
[2:59:40] Elijah?
[2:59:43] &gt;&gt; Because on him was a double portion,
[2:59:44] right?
[2:59:48] But the one that was raptured
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; was the one with least miracle.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; SO THE AMOUNT OF MIRACLES
[3:00:04] that you can perform
[3:00:06] doesn't make you rapture ready.
[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE
[3:00:17] MANY SHALL COME TO ME IN THAT DAYS. MANY
[3:00:20] SHALL come to me in THAT DAYS.
[3:00:23] HAVE WE NOT DONE THIS? HAVE WE NOT DONE
[3:00:25] THIS IN YOUR NAME?
[3:00:30] THEY HAVE DONE MANY MIRACLES
[3:00:33] IN THE NAME of Jesus Christ.
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:00:42] And Jesus said,
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; "I never knew you."
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; You know what their problem was?
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; Their attitude.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we had time, you understand?
[3:01:01] JESUS SAID, "I NEVER KNEW YOU."
[3:01:05] YES, Jesus knew them.
[3:01:12] He said they never knew you
[3:01:15] BUT WE HAVE DONE we
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; you understand
[3:01:20] we
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; wrong attitude
[3:01:28] very simple
[3:01:33] is it not is it not the hour
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; of I
[3:01:39] &gt;&gt; me
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; selfie.
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Is it not the hour? Come on, church.
[3:01:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ABOUT ME. ME. ME.
[3:01:57] &gt;&gt; Not rapture ready.
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JESUS TOLD THOSE THAT DID
[3:02:07] MIRACLES
[3:02:09] EVEN IN HIS NAME SAID, "I don't know
[3:02:12] you.
[3:02:23] Isn't that beautiful?
[3:02:25] [applause]
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; Now let's go quickly quickly. Oh yeah.
[3:02:34] Is running the time.
[3:02:38] [clears throat]
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; So Elijah Elijah
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; was a man of same kind of passion.
[3:02:54] You know, Elijah
[3:02:56] had his ups
[3:02:59] and he had his down.
[3:03:04] I have my ups
[3:03:07] and I have my downs.
[3:03:09] Have you your ups? Who has his ups?
[3:03:15] Who has his downs?
[3:03:19] Yeah, we have
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; Elijah was THE SAME.
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT GREAT UP ON MOUNT CARMEL.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; Goodness me, what a victory on Mount
[3:03:31] Carmel.
[3:03:36] What a victory.
[3:03:39] All the the the priests of you know the
[3:03:41] of the the the B priest get killed.
[3:03:47] Is that right?
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT UP OF ELIJAH?
[3:03:55] HE WAS SO SO ENERGIZED
[3:03:59] THAT HE WAS OVERTAKING THE CHARIOTS.
[3:04:05] Was he was he rapture ready
[3:04:11] NEXT DAY?
[3:04:17] SITTING UNDER A TREE.
[3:04:21] SAY, LORD,
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; now listen very carefully
[3:04:25] with his suicide spirit on him.
[3:04:32] I want to say that again.
[3:04:34] With his suicide spirit on him.
[3:04:46] You know what he said to God?
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; Take my life.
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; TAKE I WANT TO DIE.
[3:04:53] TAKE MY LIFE.
[3:04:59] I asked you a question. Was he rapture
[3:05:02] ready?
[3:05:12] Hallelujah.
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; Give you a little bit something that
[3:05:16] will help you
[3:05:18] &gt;&gt; so that you don't come in that condition
[3:05:23] where you are trying to commit suicide.
[3:05:29] Elijah did a great mistake.
[3:05:35] That why this spirit
[3:05:38] of suicide
[3:05:40] was so close to him
[3:05:44] that he is asking God
[3:05:47] take my life.
[3:05:59] It's very interesting.
[3:06:02] &gt;&gt; God didn't get God did not get angry
[3:06:04] with him.
[3:06:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my church.
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; God didn't get angry with him
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; because God knew him.
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; You know what God did?
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; You know what God did?
[3:06:25] Ah,
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; you said Elijah,
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; rest yourself here.
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; What did God do?
[3:06:33] &gt;&gt; What did God do? He brought him a good
[3:06:36] meal.
[3:06:51] GOD GOD DIDN'T SEND.
[3:06:53] Now get me right now, please. I don't
[3:06:56] want to say that offensive.
[3:06:59] God didn't send a group of Pentecostal
[3:07:01] preachers
[3:07:06] to cast out
[3:07:08] that suicide spirit.
[3:07:13] God brought down a good meal.
[3:07:19] [cheering]
[3:07:20] So you understand
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; when you are in depression,
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; watch what you eat.
[3:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's very simple.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; I was praying FOR A GIRL NOT LONG AGO.
[3:07:51] For a young woman, a married mother of
[3:07:54] two children
[3:07:57] that went into a state of schizophrenic.
[3:08:05] Two people shitzu schizophrenic.
[3:08:15] She was a beautiful She She is a
[3:08:17] beautiful Christian girl,
[3:08:21] had a wonderful husband,
[3:08:26] &gt;&gt; two children,
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; and she fell into a ditch
[3:08:30] and she rejected the husband. She
[3:08:33] rejected her child
[3:08:36] and she felt the rapture has taken place
[3:08:41] and we are out of it.
[3:08:43] She didn't want to live with the
[3:08:45] husband.
[3:08:47] That's a spirit.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's the devil.
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[3:08:54] &gt;&gt; But I TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET HAD TOLD US in demonology
[3:09:02] the devil cannot take you
[3:09:06] unless
[3:09:07] he finds a weak spot.
[3:09:10] THAT'S WHY CANCER
[3:09:14] &gt;&gt; CANNOT COME to a healthy cell.
[3:09:21] &gt;&gt; Cancer
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; comes to a weakened a broken cell.
[3:09:35] Uhhuh.
[3:09:37] Right.
[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[3:09:41] The demon of cancer
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; cannot take you
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; unless you have a broken cell somewhere.
[3:09:51] Is that correct?
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:55] &gt;&gt; So how how can I help my body
[3:09:59] heal my broken cell?
[3:10:05] Amen. Amen.
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:09] Now listen as we go from Elijah
[3:10:15] on him the depressive spirit
[3:10:18] that wanted to commit suicide
[3:10:21] and God just give him a good meal
[3:10:29] shows this is what he needed.
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[3:10:43] NOW, WAS HE RAPTURE ready
[3:10:48] even WHEN HE WAS IN HIS LOWEST MOMENT?
[3:10:54] &gt;&gt; YES.
[3:10:59] I will show you a little later.
[3:11:02] Now one great mistake Elijah did
[3:11:06] you can read it in second kings we don't
[3:11:07] read it but you can read it at home
[3:11:11] it is in second kings
[3:11:14] uh the first kings 19
[3:11:18] I think it is where Elijah
[3:11:22] after the great VICTORY
[3:11:25] AS HE WAS DROPPING INTO THE valley
[3:11:29] he sends his servant away
[3:11:33] because he wants to be alone.
[3:11:37] This is typical
[3:11:40] a sign
[3:11:42] when depressions is hitting you.
[3:11:47] You want to be alone
[3:11:51] there. He made his mistake.
[3:11:53] He sent even his servant away.
[3:11:57] WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE?
[3:12:00] TO LIFT HIM UP.
[3:12:03] WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE? TO HELP HIM.
[3:12:07] WHY WAS THE SERVANT THERE? WHY WE HAVE
[3:12:10] ONE ANOTHER
[3:12:12] TO LIFT US UP? IF A BROTHER FALLS IN
[3:12:15] BATTLE, LIFT HIM UP.
[3:12:19] AMEN.
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; And Elijah Elijah made a great mistake.
[3:12:26] He sent the servant away
[3:12:28] and then he fell into his ditch.
[3:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CHURCH. THAT'S WHY WE
[3:12:35] HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
[3:12:38] THAT'S WHY COME TO CHURCH.
[3:12:40] IF YOU FEEL DEPRESSED,
[3:12:42] IF YOU FEEL YOU WANT TO BE ALONE,
[3:12:45] THAT IS THE TIME TO COME TO CHURCH.
[3:12:50] THAT IS THE TIME STILL TO COME.
[3:12:53] SHOW THE RIGHT KIND OF ATTITUDE.
[3:12:56] IN THE GOOD DAYS,
[3:12:58] &gt;&gt; IN THE GOOD DAYS I COME TO CHURCH.
[3:13:01] IN THE BAD DAYS I COME TO CHURCH.
[3:13:05] AMEN.
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:13:09] &gt;&gt; As we are closing.
[3:13:11] &gt;&gt; As we are closing. Watch very close. So
[3:13:15] here Elijah
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; goes
[3:13:19] to be changed.
[3:13:25] Right.
[3:13:27] Elijah goes now and he knows his time
[3:13:30] has come.
[3:13:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[3:13:34] &gt;&gt; He hears a lot of prophecy,
[3:13:37] the sons of the prophets coming to him
[3:13:41] speaking about this is his time.
[3:13:44] You know what he's saying? I know.
[3:13:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:13:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:13:53] THIS IS A TIME CHURCH
[3:13:56] WHEN the translation comes.
[3:13:59] This is a time of our rapture.
[3:14:03] &gt;&gt; What do you say?
[3:14:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, we know.
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet has told us and we see all
[3:14:11] those things coming.
[3:14:13] AND LIFT UP YOUR EYES FOR YOUR
[3:14:16] REDEMPTION DRAWS NEAR.
[3:14:18] THE REDEMPTION OF OUR BODIES.
[3:14:22] HALLELUJAH.
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; HEY, come on.
[3:14:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you what
[3:14:30] &gt;&gt; now. Okay. You are you are Elijah. Okay.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; You're the favorite one. You're
[3:14:35] raptured.
[3:14:37] &gt;&gt; Remember that day
[3:14:39] when he was taken away,
[3:14:42] he stood Elijah
[3:14:45] &gt;&gt; and there should Elijah.
[3:14:47] &gt;&gt; Elijah. He stood in the chariot and the
[3:14:51] chariot went up.
[3:14:53] &gt;&gt; That was his change, right?
[3:14:57] &gt;&gt; They talked to one another.
[3:15:03] Nobody was praying.
[3:15:05] Nobody was on his knees. One was in the
[3:15:08] chariot.
[3:15:10] One stood outside the chariot and they
[3:15:12] talked with one another. Rapture will be
[3:15:15] daily routine.
[3:15:17] Rapture will be some daily routine.
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; I must be honest.
[3:15:24] If I would be Elijah,
[3:15:28] &gt;&gt; if I would be Elijah,
[3:15:30] &gt;&gt; I would step with him in a chariot.
[3:15:38] You understand that? So it was such a
[3:15:42] normal happening.
[3:15:45] AND AS ELIJAH WAS GOING,
[3:15:48] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH SAID, "HEY,
[3:15:50] THE MANTLE [screaming]
[3:15:56] WITH OTHER WORDS,
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING."
[3:16:05] AND ELIJAH SAID, "OH,
[3:16:08] HE TOOK THE MANTLE."
[3:16:13] AMEN.
[3:16:18] CHURCH.
[3:16:20] It will be your day in your daily
[3:16:22] routine.
[3:16:24] The rapture will come. The rapture will
[3:16:27] go. But watch as I'm closing
[3:16:32] one. Have you watched?
[3:16:37] There was a way
[3:16:40] that Elijah went
[3:16:44] to his rapture,
[3:16:47] from Gilgal
[3:16:49] to Bil
[3:16:51] from Bal to Jericho
[3:16:54] and from Jericho to the Jordan.
[3:16:58] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT?
[3:17:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:17:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS OUR WAY
[3:17:04] TO THE RAPTURE. FROM GILGAL TO BAL, FROM
[3:17:08] BAL TO JERICHO AND FROM Jericho to the
[3:17:11] Jordan.
[3:17:13] AND WHEN THEY CROSSED JORDAN
[3:17:15] THERE, THE chariot came to them.
[3:17:20] Watch very close.
[3:17:22] This will surprise you.
[3:17:25] This will surprise you.
[3:17:28] Okay. Now, I'm Elijah. Okay.
[3:17:31] I'm Elijah. He's Elisha.
[3:17:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, we start our journey
[3:17:39] in Gilgar.
[3:17:41] &gt;&gt; What is Elijah doing?
[3:17:43] &gt;&gt; Elijah is telling Elijah,
[3:17:47] "Stay here."
[3:17:49] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[3:17:52] He wants to be alone.
[3:18:03] He wants to be alone.
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; A typical sign
[3:18:07] of someone
[3:18:09] &gt;&gt; that is in depression.
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; Now watch.
[3:18:15] &gt;&gt; What is Elisha doing?
[3:18:18] [applause]
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. ELISHA IS NOT LAYING HANDS ON him
[3:18:28] because he's on his way to the rapture.
[3:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[3:18:38] &gt;&gt; ELISHA IS JUST SAYING.
[3:18:40] NO, I don't leave you alone. I go with
[3:18:44] you.
[3:18:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HAVE LEARNED
[3:18:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD THAT YOU ARE ALONE.
[3:18:52] AMEN.
[3:18:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; THEY COME TO THE NEXT PLACE.
[3:18:59] &gt;&gt; THEY COME TO BETH.
[3:19:01] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS ELIJAH DOING?
[3:19:04] &gt;&gt; They come to Beta.
[3:19:06] &gt;&gt; You know THE PROPHETS, THE SONS OF THE
[3:19:07] PROPHETS COME AND THEY SAY THIS IS THE
[3:19:10] DAY WHERE ELIJAH IS GOING.
[3:19:13] YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? EVERYONE IS
[3:19:16] CONFESSING.
[3:19:18] THIS IS THE HOUR the rapture.
[3:19:23] What is Elijah doing? He's telling
[3:19:25] Elisha, "Stay here."
[3:19:31] What is Elijah do? Elisha doing said,
[3:19:34] "No, I'm coming with you.
[3:19:38] It's not good that YOU ARE ALONE."
[3:19:41] COME ON, CHURCH. ON HIS WAY TO THE
[3:19:44] CHANGE.
[3:19:45] ON HIS WAY to his change.
[3:19:48] Was
[3:19:51] he rapture ready?
[3:19:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:20:00] &gt;&gt; They come to Jericho.
[3:20:03] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH IS SO SO DENSED.
[3:20:08] He's so under pressure
[3:20:11] &gt;&gt; to his rapture
[3:20:14] on THE WAY TO HIS BODY CHANGE.
[3:20:16] SO MUCH MENTAL AND detention
[3:20:21] against taking
[3:20:23] alone. I want to be alone.
[3:20:25] &gt;&gt; What is Elisha saying?
[3:20:27] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; I go with you.
[3:20:34] My my my my my.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
[3:20:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:41] &gt;&gt; AND TODAY
[3:20:42] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
[3:20:44] WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
[3:20:47] HOW THINGS ARE WORKING.
[3:20:49] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW GOD IS WORKING.
[3:20:51] WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW SATAN IS
[3:20:53] WORKING.
[3:20:55] AMEN.
[3:20:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:21:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:21:00] &gt;&gt; Was Elijah rapture ready?
[3:21:07] &gt;&gt; And remember even when they came to the
[3:21:09] Jordan,
[3:21:11] he said stay here.
[3:21:17] So bad
[3:21:20] was that burden on Elijah.
[3:21:23] This should be the happiest day.
[3:21:27] I'm going to my rapture.
[3:21:31] Come on, church.
[3:21:33] Come on. Do you THINK ON YOU ON YOUR WAY
[3:21:36] TO YOUR BODY CHANGE?
[3:21:39] WHAT IS OUR IMAGINATION?
[3:21:41] OH, WONDERFUL. EVERY DAY WITH Jesus
[3:21:45] sweeter than the day before. Amen.
[3:21:54] &gt;&gt; He Elijah finds himself on his way to
[3:21:57] his body.
[3:22:03] Amen.
[3:22:05] &gt;&gt; James tells us,
[3:22:08] &gt;&gt; James tells us
[3:22:10] &gt;&gt; Elijah and of same kind of passion.
[3:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus in G. Was Jesus raptured?
[3:22:30] &gt;&gt; Was he raptured?
[3:22:33] Now here you see him in the garden of
[3:22:35] Eden, in the garden of Gethsemane,
[3:22:37] excuse me.
[3:22:41] &gt;&gt; The spirit had left him.
[3:22:44] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[3:22:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say again,
[3:22:55] when the spirit left him in Gethsemane,
[3:22:59] was he still rapture ready?
[3:23:04] because he was the rapture.
[3:23:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Thank you for that.
[3:23:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever situation
[3:23:19] &gt;&gt; God allows in your life
[3:23:24] &gt;&gt; that it's according to your purpose.
[3:23:31] you remain rapture ready.
[3:23:37] [applause]
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[3:23:42] &gt;&gt; In the garden of Gethsemane,
[3:23:45] Jesus asked three times.
[3:23:51] Three times. First time he went in, he
[3:23:54] said, "Father, if it is possible, let
[3:23:57] this cup depart from me, but not my will
[3:24:00] be done."
[3:24:02] He walked back, find his disciples
[3:24:03] sleeping. He goes back. He said,
[3:24:06] "FATHER, IF IT IS POSSIBLE, I CAN'T
[3:24:09] DEPART from
[3:24:12] not my will be done."
[3:24:14] He went out again, he comes BACK AGAIN.
[3:24:18] THE THIRD TIME HE'S ASKING GOD,
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; please
[3:24:24] not me.
[3:24:26] &gt;&gt; But not MY WILL BE DONE.
[3:24:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT [screaming] ATTITUDE.
[3:24:33] &gt;&gt; Right attitude.
[3:24:35] &gt;&gt; HE KEPT THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
[3:24:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:24:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:24:45] &gt;&gt; And then the greatest miracle
[3:24:48] happened.
[3:24:52] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16.
[3:24:56] &gt;&gt; Voice.
[3:24:59] &gt;&gt; Shout.
[3:25:01] &gt;&gt; Shout. Voice.
[3:25:07] Amen. Amen.
[3:25:08] &gt;&gt; Voice.
[3:25:10] Shout. Voice. Trumpet.
[3:25:14] &gt;&gt; Shout. Wasn't the message?
[3:25:18] Where's the voice?
[3:25:21] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the resurrection.
[3:25:24] &gt;&gt; And the trump of God.
[3:25:29] What is the trump of God?
[3:25:31] &gt;&gt; Not Mr. Trump from the United States.
[3:25:37] The trump of God.
[3:25:47] Amen.
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; Who Who is the trump of God?
[3:25:54] &gt;&gt; A trump
[3:25:56] is an instrument
[3:25:58] &gt;&gt; that is moot.
[3:26:01] &gt;&gt; It's silent
[3:26:04] instrument.
[3:26:07] It cannot play itself.
[3:26:13] Is that right?
[3:26:14] &gt;&gt; The trump is an instrument
[3:26:18] that needs somebody
[3:26:21] to play it.
[3:26:24] &gt;&gt; Who is playing you?
[3:26:27] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST.
[3:26:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS THE MARRIAGE OF GOD.
[3:26:35] HALLELUJAH.
[3:26:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:26:40] &gt;&gt; And the voice of the resurrection.
[3:26:43] &gt;&gt; You know what it was 2,000 years ago?
[3:26:46] &gt;&gt; You know what it was? The voice of the
[3:26:48] resurrection.
[3:26:53] &gt;&gt; My God. My God.
[3:26:56] &gt;&gt; Why has thou forsaken me?
[3:27:01] And then he cried with a loud voice,
[3:27:05] &gt;&gt; "It is finished."
[3:27:10] &gt;&gt; That voice is the voice of the
[3:27:11] resurrection.
[3:27:17] What is the voice of the resurrection in
[3:27:19] this time?
[3:27:21] Is it becoming clear?
[3:27:24] When Jesus was hanging AT THE CROSS,
[3:27:27] MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN
[3:27:30] ME?
[3:27:32] &gt;&gt; Was he raptured already?
[3:27:43] &gt;&gt; Now I ask you again
[3:27:45] and I trust you are a little bit diverse
[3:27:48] from your feelings.
[3:27:53] who is rapture ready.
[3:27:59] God bless you.
[3:28:01] &gt;&gt; Let us stand together. [applause]
[3:28:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us pray together.
[3:28:10] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[3:28:12] &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace and mercy.
[3:28:14] We thank you for all that you have done.
[3:28:17] We thank you for a peace that the world
[3:28:20] cannot give.
[3:28:23] a reality that the world cannot give.
[3:28:27] This is not a fable.
[3:28:30] This is your story in the Bible.
[3:28:33] &gt;&gt; Stories in the Bible
[3:28:35] &gt;&gt; of men
[3:28:37] that was ready for rapture.
[3:28:40] And here we are standing today
[3:28:43] as Elijah.

[3:28:51] &gt;&gt; may it defeat
[3:28:54] &gt;&gt; every enemy
[3:28:56] &gt;&gt; that is trying to bring us down.
[3:28:59] &gt;&gt; May it defeat
[3:29:02] any depressive spirit
[3:29:05] that tells the people you cannot make it
[3:29:08] to the rapture.
[3:29:11] May it defeat
[3:29:13] the enemy. [music]
[3:29:15] I pray father and as we are continuing
[3:29:19] we love you and we thank you for your
[3:29:22] grace and for your mercy
[3:29:24] and may your kingdom come
[3:29:28] as it is in heaven so now on earth.
[3:29:32] We thank you for the marriage of the
[3:29:33] lamb
[3:29:34] and we are so grateful that we are ready
[3:29:37] for the marriage supper.
[3:29:39] We love you and we appreciate you.
[3:29:42] We worship you,

[3:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you so much.
[3:42:07] You may be seated. [music]
[3:42:10] We want to dedicate a baby
[3:42:14] a team Brenda if they can bring her
[3:42:16] forward.
[3:42:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:42:20] &gt;&gt; Bring them in.
[3:42:24] Bring them in.
[3:42:28] Bring them [singing]
[3:42:30] in from the fears of sin. [music]
[3:42:37] Bring [singing]
[3:42:38] them in.
[3:42:41] Bring [music]
[3:42:42] them in.
[3:42:45] bring [singing]
[3:42:46] the wondering ones to [music] Jesus.
[3:42:51] [singing]
[3:42:54] &gt;&gt; You know in the Bible
[3:42:57] they never baptized any child.
[3:43:00] But in Matthew chapter 19,
[3:43:04] they brought the [music] little children
[3:43:07] and they gave them to Christ
[3:43:10] to bless them. And that's what we do. We
[3:43:14] don't baptize little children because
[3:43:17] baptism
[3:43:19] is for people understand what they are
[3:43:21] doing.
[3:43:22] The Bible says man believes with the
[3:43:25] heart
[3:43:26] and confesses with the mouth.
[3:43:30] Excuse me.
[3:43:38] So this little child that's being
[3:43:40] [music] brought here,
[3:43:43] we are not going to baptize
[3:43:46] but just to dedicate these children.
[3:43:49] So let us pray for Brenda.
[3:43:53] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
[3:43:54] Christ,
[3:43:56] &gt;&gt; we dedicate a team Brenda into the
[3:43:58] [music] hands of God.
[3:44:02] We pray that father your grace may come
[3:44:04] down upon this child.
[3:44:07] [music] You may protect this child in it
[3:44:09] in her life.
[3:44:12] And we pray you may give the ability to
[3:44:13] the parents [music]
[3:44:16] to raise this child in the fear of the
[3:44:18] Lord.
[3:44:20] May you also open the doors for all the
[3:44:22] needs of this child.
[3:44:26] her welfare,
[3:44:28] her health, her education,
[3:44:32] dressing and feeding, protection and
[3:44:34] everything. Lord,
[3:44:37] that you've commanded the parents how to
[3:44:38] raise their children.
[3:44:41] May you bring this child also to the
[3:44:42] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:44:46] during the course of her life here on
[3:44:48] earth
[3:44:49] that she may accept you as a personal
[3:44:51] savior [music]
[3:44:53] and be born into the kingdom of God.
[3:44:56] We rebuke all forces and all powers of
[3:44:58] darkness
[3:45:00] that always come against little children
[3:45:04] even against people. We command them in
[3:45:07] the name of [music] Jesus Christ. We
[3:45:10] pray that your grace be upon this child
[3:45:13] the gift of good health and even to grow
[3:45:16] up as a normal child
[3:45:18] that she can be your handmade in your
[3:45:20] kingdom.
[3:45:22] Bless this family father. provide for
[3:45:25] all that they have need of
[3:45:28] that they may never lack to raise this
[3:45:30] child
[3:45:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus pray and
[3:45:34] ask this.
[3:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:42] I just have some few announcements to
[3:45:44] make them go out.
[3:45:47] We are running out of time
[3:45:50] but we have only one hour to be out.
[3:45:53] [music]
[3:45:55] and then we come back immediately
[3:45:58] that we can feed more.
[3:46:03] So I just want to announce to the church
[3:46:05] members here
[3:46:09] on 20th which is this Saturday
[3:46:13] we are going to have a praying and
[3:46:14] fasting meeting here.
[3:46:17] Then on Sunday,
[3:46:20] 21st of December,
[3:46:23] the coming Sunday, we are going to have
[3:46:26] two services. [music]
[3:46:29] The first service for all of us,
[3:46:32] an afternoon service for the youth
[3:46:37] who are still in school.
[3:46:39] Then also we have a convention, youth
[3:46:42] convention starting in
[3:46:46] starting on 18th
[3:46:49] this Thursday
[3:46:52] up to 21st December.
[3:46:55] So you invited those who can make it
[3:46:59] already. Three people have made
[3:47:00] willingness to go there.
[3:47:03] Then on we have another invitation.
[3:47:09] There is another youth convention in
[3:47:11] Gaza
[3:47:15] starting on 29th of December
[3:47:19] up to 1st January.
[3:47:22] And I would encourage our youth here so
[3:47:24] much
[3:47:27] to be part of that.
[3:47:29] Praise the name of our Lord. Even the
[3:47:31] parents if you can support your children
[3:47:33] to be part of that.
[3:47:38] And I believe will be built when they
[3:47:39] attend it. They will be built when they
[3:47:42] attend it.
[3:47:44] So those who want to attend the Gaza
[3:47:46] convention,
[3:47:48] get in touch with brother William.
[3:47:52] We generated the list for the poor
[3:47:54] going.
[3:47:58] We just need to see that that is done.
[3:48:02] Praise the name of. So let me invite
[3:48:05] brother to come and close the service
[3:48:07] with prayer.
[3:48:09] Brother, if you can come and then bless
[3:48:11] the food.
[3:48:33] Amen. Amen.
[3:48:41] Amen.
[3:48:46] Amen.
[3:48:54] Yes, sir.
[3:48:59] Amen.

[3:49:11] Amen.
[3:49:20] Amen.
[3:49:28] Amen. Amen.
[3:49:32] Amen. So
[3:49:34] we are just going to go out

[3:49:57] priority in the serving. So you are all
