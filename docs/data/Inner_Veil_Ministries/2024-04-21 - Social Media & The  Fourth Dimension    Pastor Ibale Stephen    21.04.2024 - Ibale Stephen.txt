May the Holy Spirit come down in a special way to Vis every soul in a special way I've committed this service into your in Jesus name amen am so while we are standing we shall turn to Daniel chapter 8 and then we shall turn to eel 3 you welcome to the service and as usual just relax and feed from the Lord I'm just going to speak to you amen so that the Lord may find a way to lead and guide us in the service amen Daniel and verse two he says and I saw saw in a vision and it came to pass when I saw that I was atan in the palace which is in the province of and I saw in a vision and I was by the river e 3 verse then the spirit took me up and had behind me a vo of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place you may be seated so today I'm speaking to you from what you would think would be a unique subject I want to speak on the social media and the fourth dimension that's very important for us so we have seven dimensions of life that run from the natural world to the spirit world so these seven dimensions are light time matter those are three dimensions now then we've got a special Dimension which is called the fourth dimension this is the dimension of faith is like a channel which takes you from the natural world into the spiritual world when you are still in your physical body so it's going to be a very special Dimension we deal with today and then from the fourth dimension then you begin to touch the spirit world where The Fifth Dimension is Hell the sixth Dimension is Paradise which was lifted up which uh the scripture would refer to as under the altar and then the seventh Dimension is what we would call the third Heavens the aboard of God himself amen so life spiritual and natural is experienced through seven levels and science cause those levels dimensions so I've told you between the natural world and then the spirit world there is a middle spot which we call Faith or we can call channel in you stand between the natural world and the spirit world so now the natural man normally through three uh Dimensions the first three [Music] dimensions which is light without light you cannot be operate and then the second one is matter whatever you deal with is matter if it's food if it's your friend if you are going to work that's the level of matter and then time so whatever you have you know you do you are doing it because you care how much time you have you needed light to be here you needed matter to be here because you watching over time that's how you live in the natural world so your natural senses they operate through those three dimensions they operate by natural evidence because you've got five senses as a person one of the senses is sight and then the next one is you hear then the third one you can test and then the next one you can feel when you are there and something touches you you said that's not part of me and then the fifth one you can smell okay so but there is a spiritual part of each one of us and this spiritual part of us has a spiritual detector and this detector might be a holy test or a you know a wicked test depending on the spiritual status of the individual you find a man he always desires holy stuff he wants to be in the presence of the Lord he wants to pray he wants to be postive he wants to study that is his and then there are some other people that you know may come to church but they don't care if they don't they don't care to study they don't care to pray then there are those who are completely gone they always desire to have some path amen something like drugs alcohol go out in a wild party of something like that so now there is the natural you and then there is the spiritual you the natural you here which is five senses which lives in the four three dimensions he goes to sleep when he's tired you just knock off and you don't know what what's happening around you but there is a spiritual you that does not go to sleep are you together with me so many times the spiritual you expresses himself in dreams amen and these dreams many times reflect our spiritual conditions that's the spiritual you does not sleep at all from the day was born to the day dies he never sleeps but there is a natural you that always goes to sleep so if your condition is all seen that's what you desire there is no way your inner man can touch a spirit world he cannot dream spiritual dreams he cannot dream going to heaven cannot dream having a spiritual service the dreams that he will have are the reflections of what his condition is are you together with me he love dreams when he's in a disco he have a dream when he's fighting he have a dream when is stilling are you together with me so therefore we need to keep our mind clear in order to keep in contact with are you together with me you keep your mind clear if anything passes your mind which you really see is not scripture you clean it under the blood and you father I want my inner man to be intact and clean are you together with me you don't allow the inner man to become negative every time you are just negative when we say this you turn to this when they say church is this you will say no when we say we are going to do this this is such a man get in contact with God and if you are a true Christian and you persistently dream evil then it's time for you to go to God In Prayer because your inner man is warning you about the future okay so that means your inner man is sensing danger in your spiritual work so a fact that all humanity is influenced by Spirit whether man is spiritual or is not spiritual he is influenced by a spiritual brother Bram says M amen influence for man outside world I should understand by the grace of God I deal with the spirits are you together with me so brother Bram now puts a principle here that whether this man is a witch or he's a murderer or he's a robber he's influenced by an outside world and if this man is a Christian he fears God he desires to grow spiritually he is also influenced by another world so they are two different world that control Humanity we are here but we don't control ourselves so if a man becomes so contr that he does things that you don't understand you don't fight him because you know that man is influenced by an outside world we wrestle not with flesh and blood are you together with me but we wrestle with the spirits from man Unseen World you don't need to ask a man who criticizes you because you know what world you are dealing with brother Bram says I understand I deal with the spirit and then he says here again you cannot be here a spiritual being s or Saint without having an influence from under world or from the above World [Music] Saint Saint from above those are the two influences so we are here the two World P upon us okay that's why when one deals with people you must know what kind of spirits you are dealing with we are all operated by a spiritual negative POS there is a spirit world that controls you so again in another message it says now in my work for my master I deal with Spirits all together nothing natural it is all together Spirits if you understand that you are going to live as a free Christian whatever Rises against you you know you are dealing with the spirit whether it's a man you are dealing with the spirit are you together with me you are just dealing with the spirit when you are dealing with a brother you are supposed to be dealing with the Holy Spirit you understand what I mean if you dealing with a non Christian then you know you are dealing with world and you must always put a distance he says you take a good man and let him marry a bad woman that woman will either become a good woman or he'll become a bad man Spirit that's my life I deal with the spirit I don't look at the person I catch him by his spirit amen that's how brother Bram dealt with people just by looking at them talking to them hearing their words putting them back into the words and then you begin to discern so brother Bram would say I'm talking to you a little bit so that I can be able to catch your SP you can never hide what you are to a man who has the word and to a man who is Holy Ghost you can never hide what you are your life is an expression of a spirit world and understanding you as one to go beyond what he can see amen and also beyond what he can hear together with me yes sir so to link to the spirit world one must somehow go beyond the five human senses and then you enter into a channel amen and that channel here is the fourth dimension which we either call Faith which in the stud we are calling a channel is what brings you from the natural world to the spirit world that's the fourth dimension is in between the dimensions so we need the B of the the Holy Ghost to understand people if you don't have the B of the Holy Ghost you can never understand people they can take you for a right they can cause the church to knock heads because you are dealing with them kind but brother Bram tells us he deals with his spirits and that's what we must learn to deal with amen so everybody is an operation center of a spirit world because both God and Satan must be embodied before they operate in this world so then we can ask what embodiment are you because God must use a man and Satan must use the man so there must be an embodiment for a man to operate in this world okay so the Holy Ghost now helps us to associate as an angoy Fellowship hallelujah hallelujah because how was supposed to be an angel fellow he helps my to contact your it's a Divine Fellowship when we talk we are actually dealing with a level higher than Humanity hallelujah hallelujah you are allowing God the nature of God himself that he created from before I mean when he created man he created a gene cell he was a spirit man and placed him in a body so our fellowship is not flesh to flesh hence forth know we no man after the our fellowship touching bestow a Divine Fellowship to relate by the seed gen of life and once you have being a by grace to enter into that spot of life then you benefit from the fruits of un Angelic W amen if you are gifted then Visions can come the word of wisdom can come the word of knowledge can come because you are now communicating with an Angelic world you can speak and things can be you can lay hands on the SE and they can receive their healing are you together with me because it's not this it's the inner man there that we must live back and that's why we come to church so that we may break out of this and standing that channel as a spirit anointed men and when you stand in that chel to enter into the spirit world you end up in the seventh Dimension where you can say like Daniel and I saw and I heard amen so you may not see natural but there can come an inspiration of the world that's why when I preach here somebody comes to you and says Pastor these were the things I was meditating on Amen you were touching a spirit world are you together with me yeah because you are trying to prepare yourself to me to the Lord You Lord I do not know when you come and as you begin to meditate like that Heavenly things begin to break down but if you are complet inhabit by spirits of negativity I don't know what will happen to that man but God God God my God my God you are cursing but you want to you to hear from God you are getting into that channel in a very s ground because once you go further then your communication will be from hell I even got a vision when he has even died in an accident you see what I mean so I'm dealing with social media and the fourth dimension so let us look at a prophet here you know brother Bram one time he was saying oh maybe when I get out of this body and we get in heaven there maybe I'll just be a spirit just flying somewhere and I say hello Papa you know maybe what am I you know so God says would you want to experience this are you seeing now where it starts from from True meditation amen you know when something is happening then God begins to take him up he says he says I would like that very much then he went out out of his body to be on the C of time then he came back to tell so what are your meditations how do you live your day trying to wish them evil you are now sliding into fourth dimension but in a very SLE man talk about Visions you can get them but from where because the fourth dimension it's just a channel praise the Lord so let us look at a prophet here a prophet is a special man he lives between natural and Supernatural World he's always stationed in that channel amen is natural here but easily falls into the supernatural World brother Bram says now I see your Visions his subconscious is not far from him he doesn't go to sleep he just breaks from from one conscious to another amen sometimes me I have to go to sleep and then I get a spiritual dream but not a prophet he lives between these two worlds so beyond the five senses one steps into the fourth dimension before he can get into spiritual world but the prophet is permanently living in that channel so the fourth dimension is the channel brother Bram called it Faith amen he also called it the super and he called it also the six because the natural man has five natural senses testing saring see are you together with me but then there is a 6 sense that's now that channel brother Bram called it Fai amen then he call it a super because it's a sense above the five amen it connects you to a spirit worldall and then he calls it also the six sense because it's extra from the five natural senses but then the elected inner man amen you always will have that super sense which is called Faith hallelujah hallelujah listen to what the prophet say in the message of super and the super is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you that's the super and you let the five senses Bei the six that's where the scripture says we don't walk by sight but we walk by faith by allowing our five senses to submit to the Super S amen it to guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super for it is so far above Naturals as the spiritual man is above a natural man it is far and high as the heaven is above the natural man [Music] these five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about the devil can get into these five senses and light you but he cannot touch the super that's far beyond his reach that's why Paul says I has not seen and ears have not heard what God has prepared come on now you see where I'm coming from but this faith is a channel because it doesn't stop at itself it guides you into another dimension it is a dimension which science has already tapped into by radio and TV TV can be in America and bring you the visions of what is happening in the United States of America right now can go to the Battleground in Israel and bring to you the images as they are happening out there that's how the prophets lived their lives that's what Daniel said and I saw and eel and I heard his voices and images okay so brother Bram back and forth he Zed into that channel by stepping away from his act active self amen you know you would say let William Bram get out of the way and then he would step into the Super and then you would say you are not from here you came from a far country it's a mountaineous country you are from Tennessee your name is so and so that's not five censes the super sense has opened the channel and he seeing you like he would see a TV the way you could break into communication with the supernatural world not everybody has got that ability but yet at the same time God would allow you to enter into Dimension and then you begin receiving some inspiration and then he start saying yes yeah I know I'll ask the pastor and when you ask the pastor he ask you how did you get to thinking that way like that but you were going through a channel are you together with me yeah so many times God has allowed you to come through that channel and then you come back with blessings and you say I just even didn't know how I overcame this temptation but you opened up into Channel anointing and power came down to support you in battle amen so how does the fourth dimension operate let's go now back to the scripture we read Daniel 8 verse that's just you begin to see science stopped into it eel 32 then the spirit took me up and I had behind me a voice images and voices prophets easily get into that fourth dimension and they say things and those things which they say the natural man who has not been to that Dimension can break himself over those us a son is born and then a man who is spirit I mean and intellect but these men here they think we don't have brain you know what Isaiah says the son is born I asked him where is he and he says I don't know he thinks we are going to be led by that stuff you know a fourth dimension can only be understood by spiritual are you together with me yeah it's only that you see you cannot really get into it and understand they live the state of Consecration and that's why the easily touch a superatural now you have to learn to spare some time in the morning as we send the exultations just 10 minutes listen to the scripture and be able to be part of that prayer and take something and meditate for the day going to see things begin to change in your life in the evening you take some meditation to you with you to B and see what God is going to start the shepher is just helping you to get into that channel amen you see you just need to have something to take you there brother Bram had something to take him there he started meditating and then God opens the channel what do you meditate on many times your meditation Bobby wine all movement politics bed very grief because has been beat that kind of medit open up super have something spiritual that's the channel because you are going to sleep and you'll end up if you are married you kick your wife in the bed because you were in a channel and you are seeing either somebody calling a my husband the man is in he has entered into Channel he's a different control let us get into the CH of the word amen amen sacrifice let God see your commitment okay if you are not able to make it on church church but is it genuine all you just want relax back home and you are watching I love that was the days of brother brother it was there and it was always timing the Wednesday night that's the time they would put in that soap uh uhuh you know you come late you cannot enter into that Channel with that kind of a li you need to be committed amen so prophets easily enter there because they spend their time meditating and consecrating they always in a presence so I want to say now that getting into the fourth chap is the desire of everybody and some of the people who want to get into that channel so that they can come back with enough power to pray for the sick that's what they want to go there you remember Simon the S he says I'll give you some money if you lay your hands on me and then I can enter into the channel and whoever lay hand is going to be well that's what Pentecost is all about it's about power but you should be about Consecration and allowing God to use you the way he chooses amen so many of us must be careful tampering with the spirit world if you are not F to live up there you'll spiritually shut I was talking with a brother and I told him a church is the fruit of a Ministry if you get the man away by throwing him out it doesn't matter watch what happens to the you see people think but godis for a season and for a place amen amen so let's talk a little bit now we see the channel let's talk about the social media now the social media it hangs in the fourth dimension his images and voices and mostly communication from a spirit world so the fourth dimension which is a contact Dimension we launch a man into the spiritual for the believer he launches into the seventh Dimension if he's not a prophet he will not see visits if he's not a prophet he will not hear voices if he's not a prophet he will receive spiritual [Music] inspiration over different matters of his life God will open the word to him he's always in contact with the spirit world are you together with me but for prophets it images and voices now I want to say this no man stands to preach without touching the spirit world first are you together with me no man stands to preach without first of all touching the spirit whether a cardinal or he a bishop it doesn't matter who he is he must first of all get into contact with the the first thing therefore when a man stands out to preach where does he want to take us that should be the question amen there is Noh man will produce clean water for the people when he enters into that channel when he has got hate and competition when he comes out everything that will come out of you is going to be a refle so the fourth dimension is a faith gate for the believer to link him into fellowship with God but the same Dimension is an open gate to the mind of Lucifer for the unsanctified vessel that enters into that channel so and today especially the young people we've got what they call yoga meditations yoga meditations yog yog okay you see you know they are teaching people how to enter into a spirit world and discover themselves they tell you enter just meditate they teaching people how to touch the fourth dimension enter into the spirit world and discover themselves these meditations are deser trying to push you into a heightened state of Consecration and drop you into relaxed state in the you know inner awareness it is designed method to lead you into a channel and the station is The Fifth Dimension they are B of Satan and most of the young ladies are yoger now they do a lot of yoga they KN they wait for quite a number of time until they start thinking that they are special that they are super people that they are this and they enter you know it's a designed method to lead the people into the depth of Satan area which now we've got a wichual some are genuine and some are not genuine but the real wit touches a dimension okay a real which goes into this Dimension and then steps into The Fifth Dimension and sees vision and he says you live in such and such a place and there is a place like this You've Got A Friend Of Yours he lives in such and such a place he's in a dimension brother Bram speaks of Miss Piper misser you know she was a witch and brother Bram says now she's a genuine witch now there is a real one and there is somebody impersonating he says Miss Piper was a real witch she was just an ordinary housewi and she fell into TR one day while in suffering and she began to speak to the Dead she touched a dimension and that's what brother Bram is calling a trans and she began talking to the dead so people get into those transes and draw from a dimension they come from those Dimensions with designs some Fashions and some kind of a way of look and the world today is designed by a spirit world the devil knows how to design the women it's not a good thinking person who thinks about this kind of design there are these dresses here which are tight here and they are very wide around here and now one time you are walking the wind just come that's what they want the devil designed them for that you know these designs and fashions they don't come from a right thinking person it's a person going somewhere he has been to a dimension Miss Piper so one time brother Bram saw that Dimension and then he saw it in a vision but then 40 years later he went to escort his wife for shopping thec pen store and you know while he was there his wife started going shopping you know when you go with your wife shopping you need to be patient you suff along you know because they look I think at this car po five times read all the notes then put that one down then get this one here look at it then sniff it a little bit she even call you which one do you think is better they always like shopping for the men you just want to go in the shop and get out so brother Bram excused himself and he sat outside somewhere at the end of a conveyor you know the conveyor keeps taking the people so he started watching watching these ones these ones come then he says I really turned sick at my stomach seeing these women come up there young old indifferent wrinkled and everywhere with little bit shorts on they are F body and those sexy dressed women with those great big heads like that and and here they come and one of them coming up was a Spanish speaking to another woman she was a white woman speaking to the Spanish woman and then I looked brother Bram stops a finger all at once I was changed they I had seen that before before I had seen that one before then he says painting their eyes just recent like a cut you know put put it up like this and wearing cut glasses and everything and that brings stuff under their [Music] eyes there was that thing that I had seen when I was a child there was a woman just exactly and I just got num all over and began to look around looked like that just changed for a moment and I looked and I thought that is what I saw in Hell there they was that coner I thought because they were in Hell is What made them look that way a green blue under their eyes and there was these women painted with greenish blue just the way that Vision said about 40 years ago they were right there he saw them in a vision because when he was 14 years he was hunting and he got a gun accident and then he was taken to hospital he was bleeding to death so he got into some kind of a vision he was not born again yeah so he started going down down down and he was falling bottomless and then he started getting to people that were gr and they were there he looked and he says God if you get me out of here I'll will serve you all the days of my life and down there is where he had seen those uh uh women they were painted in such a way and thought being in Hell is What made them that way but that Vision waited and came out 40 years later many of these makeups make they are just Fashions from hell all these kind of ises Amen they put out fish ones and you begin to part your eyes like a cut those are fions from hell those Spirits just come up and it comes to a season and they are popularized by the social media we have got a very big problem with the social media you do one thing overnight you are a celebrity but men who became famous in the 1960s those were real men Sportsmen like a p you know until they became famous the world over the story from one man to another to another another another social media one night you are a celebrity we are in trouble a woman picks up a fashion from hell and just goes as an act in a film you stand on the street one week later you see the fashion and I really wonder ladies you know those women who put on those high heel many of them when they are driving their cars they don't have those high heels do you know that they have driving shoes inside these shoes here are walking to the supermarket and then back to the car but poor [Music] girls we are in trouble why don't we repent from that those are designs from hell they suffer the world there is nothing as stable as a young woman is thirsting for f we'll stand and then we'll try why I dying what I dying for God have mercy praise the Lord these souls in Hell put on bodies and they come forth with attitudes and ways of life and they begin to stay in the community and then the social media are you together with me some of them are very mean men he begins to do this and then you just wait for a few weeks they are matchs spirits put on bodies and they Negative they start using some terminologies and now some of the young people even said those words not knowing what they mean this man the spirits they come and embody the people they become unteachable you point them to this they will point to that wild and Desiring to spread their anointing amen you can never change them because they can never be reborn they are not Eternal seeds amen they proceed from The Fifth Dimension and Inspire fashion designers they pop up through the fourth dimension as designers musicians and film actors and they come up with certain words they sing words you don't understand you can never find them in any language you cannot search them in are spirits and as the people keep singing those things they are trying to invite those spirits to themselves you look at men like Hitler H man those were SS from hell amen no man could convert a devil the best you can make out of him is to make him a religious man he will not smoke he will not drink he will not not go to the next Club but even in the church is not going to be a St soul [Music] are you together with me never spend your good time meditating on something that's not the word it will launch you into a dimension so TV is a dimension like the tree of Good and Evil are you together with me the tree was there of knowing good and evil but God had given Adam and the tree of good but there was this other tree know good and evil and once they touched that tree they had no control over the evil which they discovered be careful when you are dealing with the social media Amen in the days of brother Bram it was a te program which was so popular I love Su but today is Premier League matches me at home and I sleep you see the and church we going I'm telling you that's why young men don't don't really encourage themselves with midweek did you hear what I said TV now runs on our computers which we have in our home they run on our phones it is an evil which we carry in our pockets we are potentially connected to the negative fourth dimension where brother Bram lamented that Satan has put TVs in our houses he has now decreased them in size and he has put them in our pocket are you together with me I have my but they are like the two trees in the garden which were fully interwin both good and evil in the same Dimension it now depends on how you feed on it you must be careful on how you use your it opens into a channel you cannot some young men are totally hooked up to pornography because of those a channel that is too hard for them to take control when Eve ate of the other tree for sake the Gate of knowledge was so hard it was so hard for her to control and she became a merchant of that Channel the bible says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for that it was pleas to the eyes and Tre to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof did E and became a merchant also for her husband with her and also did it and you become a merchant in church you are the one who knows the best so and you say when you see that one you will not want to stop she's tried because that gate is hard to deal with be careful there you are with social media it's a dimension pool it pours out pornography Fashions different modes of character it creates suspicion in homes everybody's monitoring the other it brings down fears and instability in family in fact researchers are found that the more a person examines their Partners Facebook activity more that person reports jealousy and mistress with the social media man has opened the channel which he can never control it's tearing families it's tearing down juvenile morals then comes this artificial intelligence which has got the capacity to destroy Society with arici idence a man can make me or can make you and make you speak even in your own words The Words which you've never said are you together with me it is going to take away people's jobs you know those I cannot go into that it becomes so hard it's destroying Society they break into Banks dig robberies and millions of dollars are transferred from bank accounts we are now launching into a driverless vehicle stage which is cyber control it will be the age of great kidnaps because a man just goes into the channel and redirects the computer of that and it takes you to where you are supposed to be kidnapped Henry you are the you are the chief people there isn't that right possible you see what I mean so the dimension is pouring out depression to young people and eating away their mental brains by volumes they don't think like we used to think anymore social media takes over brain cells and affects mental and physical health being on social media every day every hour and every minute can really cause damage your brain but we are starting our children time social media if you who just got to know this when you out would struggle to close the gates how about the children you are introducing at five years two years brother Bram saw it coming and says the lead is off of hell so and it pours out through the fourth dimension to people you better take refuge under the blood otherwise we are not say brother Bram says and brother the lead is of come of of hell that's right and streams of demon [Music] power is in out from everywhere is conquered the Nations it's conquered politics is to the conquered the churches until they know nothing denomination he says the leads of hell so any mess you make into the fourth dimension without the lead on your soul it pours out Lords of spirits like a flood towards you amen is pouring out wild music rap music rock and roll and The Rock I mean the R Music Festival rebel music festival Rebel [Music] it's a festival that's done every year in Jamaica they go there to sing Rebellion you see So speaking about rock and roll brother Brenham says and the spirit is not only in America it has spread itself all over the world to bring them to the Battle of Amad Hallelujah that music has got anointing behind to lead the people to the of young listen to rap music they become wild and they can face a bullet they don't care they anointed and preparing them effects of social media you read about these big rock concerts they always end up with violence and depression comes thereafter because you sing about what's not real you want to touch it but you cannot feel it we thank God for Christian music I love him and you feel it I love him because he first love and you say hallelujah hallelujah [Music] and it is relaxing you feel relaxed it's real years ago I was with brother Ro rodward in Germany he's a very good Street Preacher he gets his jitar text the younger people and then they begin to play the people would gather and you would tell me stepen now start now I would preach I would preach then the evening we had tent meetings we would go for the tent meeting so one woman had seen me in the street and then she told me you would be getting people here if you were singing better but you people you sing like you in a [Music] funeral because they want something big you know just no meaning but something that's what they want you go to a crusade and the things start boom boom and then nothing has come out no voice no nothing just boom Rock sound and then in the evening when I was preaching I preached on watch man what of the night and I pinned The Edge down and this woman came to me same woman says human you come from Africa I said yes what business do you have to come here and tell us what we must do I tell you you know this age is gone they under depression they don't want to be told they are depression is a condition a person sinks into just some kind of an idiot he sinks into low Ms he sees us to participate in activities it a resigned mode and some of them if they in church they hate Church the p is on theit he's suffering from something he a mental disorder and in this condition you begin to consider yourself useless insure and in most cases to a case that you cannot even explain you just see you don't have love for anybody and today the major cause of depression among the young people is the social media it will cause young people to struggle because on the post this one is eating in a big hotel I don't know what is that big hotel Sera and you know we go to the same school but we go to the same school but we don't come from the same family this is a class for Serena but my class here it is [Music] for so you would like also to sh a little bit you begin to struggle who will take me to social media it set space in fashion and character it has become a handbook life when marriages are going wrong they don't come to the pastor Google Google how do I handle a wife who is ruthless and you'll find anything on Google you'll find all kinds of advice slap very hard in the face and by the time they are starting to the py are you together with me so just like a cancer brother Bram said cancer is a fourth dimension disease and even this kind of social media it is a fourth dimension disease it is Spirit pouring from The Fifth Dimension through the Gateway of the fourth dimension is demonology by way of Technology amen is two trees in the channel into the spirit world you enter into the channel and as you enter into the channel then there are two trees there are two highways one tree grows towards destruction and the other grows towards Harvest heading out towards two different dimensions so when you enter into the fourth dimension amen depending on the spiritual condition you either going to The Fifth Dimension and you become a Mrs paper all you end up into the seventh Dimension the inspiration where brother amen am now let me show you something here in the Philadelphia Church age are you still here this morning amen so the seventh age he says a very short age gathers into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and yet all the reality of pentec everything good and bad that started with Ephesus amen they gather up into this age and the prophet says once the philadelph Ed has run out its course the Lan Edge quickly comes in bringing both the tears and the wheat to our best so we come into this Channel and then you enter into Harvest of some nature because around the edge of reformation is the edge of the open door it pours out of the evils of the edge and all the beauty of all the ages those are the two trees now either you lead the falsehood and evil and living which is the final harvest the depth of Satan for the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and yet again another Branch about the stch of a perfect the beauty of Holiness and that's what you are so there will be a people that will stand in this fourth dimension the channel fully Sanctified by the word waiting for the Lord to launch them into the seventh Dimension fellowship with the supernatural Hallelujah that's where we are his Gathering us for that you are going to be so close to the real seed until you start now causing the master to come down to come and walk in his form and then he say yes the crop is ready are we ready friends yes sir amen you step it the fourth dimension for a supernatural Fellowship father we want to ascend to the holiest by the blood of Jesus Amen brother Bram again says we are now Angelic beings associate together amen you see because you being but in a body Hallelujah hallu those are also fallen angels in bodies but we live in the same Dimension what separates us is what happens in the fourth dimension where do you go when you step in there see Angelic beings associate together if you got the holy spirit in you then you are candidate for Association with the Unseen World and the Supernatural are you together did you hear that let me read it again if you've got the Holy Spirit then you are a candidate for Association and the supernatural how many candidates do we have here amen so we stand in the CH by A Perfect faith and this perfect faith is the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ himself this faith is a supernatural Faith this channel here this faith is the saving faith of Jesus Christ this is the faith the prophet calls the Living Faith this Faith opens the CH for fellowship with God after your new B you go a channel you go into and you begin to grow there are certain things begin falling away and you say yes I experience his presence brother Bram says now see at first the disciples didn't have this Faith they didn't have it because they they had had Christ walking with him but then afterwards Christ was in them and so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it so perfect Faith connects the believer to the seventh Dimension amen so the fourth dimension is a and not a station it's a channel because it doesn't retain you it posts you on that's Fai amen originally let me explain this originally there was one dimension which is called the seventh Dimension where God lived with all the Angels but the fall of Lucifer God had to create The Fifth Dimension because what would he do with a fellow that has fallen and cannot repent he had to send him away from the dimension but he had to create him one so theth Di di menion of hell was created for the devil and his angels that's what the scripture says brother Bram said hell was created for the devil and his angels not for human beings just turn around and tell the brother around you hell is not my place it was created for the devil and his angels and then he says but if you go it's because you will want to go and you can't go easy you might must fight your way into it did you know that you can't go to hell EAS you have to fight your way to it imagine to serve a master who a from here he TS you you he torments you here on Earth there's no peace to the wicked says the Lord makes you an alcoholic takes you into Brothers those amen robs you of good family subjects you tonight Club it's not easy to go to hell the prophet says he still here first your family your children scatter because of alcoholism you become a wreck going to hell is not as easy as you think the torment begins here when God created man he also made man to live in the s Dimension with him when Man was created in a spirit form but then when God needed man to the Earth that's when he created these three dimensions of time light and matter okay then that makes five Dimensions the original one of God where Man was created to live and then when the devil fell then the fifth was created when man was put in the body three other dimensions come amen and still the body of Flesh in the body of Flesh God still visited man in Eden but when Adam fell amen and God redeemed him he had to create a six Dimension where when man dies he would go to before the fullness of redemption is come so when I pass away one of these days after brother Nathan from Z he was preaching the week before and the following Sunday today he's in glory who knows so when the Lord picks me up that's the dimension he takes me to the sixth Dimension but now we know that when sin came in the garden it was the serpent injecting himself into the human race and we got a serpent seed growing together with Humanity when they die God takes them back to Hell In The Fifth Dimension are you together with me okay now let me explain where we are now how many of you love God how many of you have ever felt that presence that you come to a point and you really say yes I've come into a presence and that presence is so when you touch that presence you feel like you can even melt it's a satisfying presence but then you can't explain it first verse after the fall God could not come back in the garden Amen in a physical person and talk to Adam and Eve so what did God do he created a channel the fourth dimension to connect you to him by faith that's what first Peter 18 says having not seen in though now you seem not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory you don't see him but you feel him Hallelujah you've stepped in a channel the Holy Ghost himself connects us into that channel but any man that touches that channel without the Holy Ghost touches the other tree he can come out with the true I mean with the tree of knowledge anointing a religious anointing which had having an sacrifice but yet with for his brethren we don't need to get there like that are you together with me you are called to live in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus to stay in that channel fully connected that if God has to speak Lord speak here I am I'm listening amen amen if he wants to use you you are like Isaiah you say send me I'm ready that's being in the channel and you are consecrated is that our desire this afternoon amen so our faith places Us in Heavenly places in channel to continue in fellowship with Christ in what call in Heavenly places let's go to Ephesians 2:6 I want to describe where we are in this present hour as sons of God Amen you need to go with the true meditation as you walk back home you tell the devil I'm in Heavenly places now you cannot pull me back amen I'm a Child of God you cannot lie to me amen and you tell the devil you've employed me a long time I have resigned your job I cannot be your your your your slave anymore God has redeemed Me That by the blood of his own son now I am a child of God I believe what God says about hallelujah hallelujah yes Ephesians 2 Verse 6 the scripture says and has raised us up together and made us together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus not will but has raised us up are you together with me not we is not talking about the I mean the natural man he's talking about the spirit man that may be for 30 years or for 20 years he was in this I mean dead in sin and trespass but now he has raised you up hallelujah hallelujah to his own righteousness so there is this raising of the seed gen on the inside to recognition that we are sons of God most we are confirmed when we receive the spirit of adoption so the inner man is a level amen Which is higher than the natural man in phes amen in a man is risen is already risen in Christ and is seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and this body here is just trying to move into that motion and when the body also gets that condition will be body change but right now you are on the ins so the inner man is contacting God through the CH of the into Heavenly places with Christ Jesus there is a part of you which is not natural natural Paul's description of heavenly places in Christ Jesus will help us to understand the level that God has placed us on when Christ came he transferred us from Mount Si of the law to Mount Zion of Grace is that amen we are not under the law anymore you were transfer from Mount Si to Mount Zion and in this transfer Paul relates the Mount Zion the Mount of grace to the present tense Fellowship of the redeemed with Heavenly beings Hallelujah there Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let's go to Hebrews and just look at where Paul says we are [Music] the fourth dimension amen under the channel of the social media is putting the people into the prison of hell but for us the fourth channel the fourth dimension and the spiritual faith is placing Us in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's where we are Hebrew 12 verse 18 He says for you are not come unto the mount that might for you are not come un the mount that might be touched and that bur with fire no unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of trumpet the voice of what which voice they that had ined that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as Beast touch the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with the D and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and [Music] quck so this allegory here defines the Wrath with which law was given all Israel could not stand before the Lord so the nature in which the law came had the connotation of judgment behind it the law is the revealer of sin and the judge of sin in it was no power to perform the law and so it was a terrifying sight and Moses said I fear greatly Moses feared because he understood the nature of man that man fails but the difference is that the next Mountain we are lifted into presence this is where we are Hallelujah he says in verse 22 but you are come to m the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem inable to the general assembly and the Church of the first which is written in heaven and to God the judge of all and the spirit of judgment made perfect to Jesus the med of the Newen and to the blood of speak better things that of Hallelujah Paul was describing the divine presence that you are now lifted into that's where the new besses us once you step into the channel Hallelujah this is where you enter into a presence not a judgment but Grace speaking better things than that of what are the better things you are a son of God you were created to overcome you can never become a slave to the devil you are being released today accept your release Hallelujah today is your day of Jubilee do you understand what I mean you are in Heavenly places and you are meeting together with the souls of just men made perfect you have been accepted into the Beloved that's what you should believe that you are a son of God you are a son of Grace you are not a son of WRA tell the devil today I am going free God bless you amen we have got our fourth Channel is not taking us to social media he's taking us into presence brother Moses God bless you amen yes we have got a rest
