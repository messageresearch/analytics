he has not visited after that but he's been part of the ministry that s hallelujah hallelujah amen and yesterday I was able to speak with brother Tim in Canada he told me to bring greetings for the church yeah this past year 2023 has been so wonderful for us has done a lot of tremendous uh fruits in our country many have come to the knowledge of the message we only in 2023 we were able to bapti over 80 Souls yeah 80 Souls I know when it comes to Uganda it's a small I know it but for Ethiopia if a single person believes it's like the whole nation has believed because is a very strong country when it comes to religion actually Ethiopians believe never believe that they are Africans although they are Africans they say we are not Africans but we live in Africa hallelujah hallelujah but we know that we are all Africans and I'm so grateful today I came with my wife sister Mery and our boy babyi baby Levi and are here with you and we welcome them amen and today I just want to speak something small that has been in my heart just to share with you I know your Elder Minister and the rest will take you deeper into the words we just here actually I came maybe to visit not really to preach it is the time that we need the ministry of the pastor more than hours so so when I was told to preach something came to my mind my heart and I fa to read the scriptures and as a subject I was thinking that a reward for service reward for service reward for service because the Bible told us that everyone may receive things done in this body according to that he had done whether it is good or bad amen amen there is a reward for a service there is a reward for whatever we do and we know we serve a living God our God is not dead God our God is a living God how many believe that our God is a living God God is a living God and we Ser a living God and we thank we thank God for the message of the hour that he gave us this message for us to be drawn very close to God this message brought us Clos to God for us to have a clo walk just like David would say my soul T is for thee we are tting of God every day and every morning we are thiry of God young children young Brethren and sisters and brothers this is not just a family a family religion this is life and days God called us to himself because he loved us before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah we are to him himself because our God is not a God who can only work yesterday actually the prophet would say what good is it if our God who did things in the past is not the same in this time we serve the same God that work things yesterday if God has healed yesterday he will still he today if he has provided yesterday he will still provide today if he has done anything yesterday he can still do it today because we serve a living God and there is a reward for every service hallelujah hallelujah and we are not here by chance by coincidence because our family believes our family members believe we were the seed of God even before this world was founded before the foundation of the world he chose us in him he did not choose other he chose us we are so grateful that he chose us he chose you my sister he chose you my brother amen amen Bible tells us the Bible tells us that we lab to be accepted in him hallelujah hallelujah you know we understand that we are saved by his grace alone but there is something that is expected from us salvation comes only from him but is us to fulfill you know our Closer Walk daily a part that we play in the kingdom of God hallelujah hallelujah there's a part there's a part that I and you can play actually the Bible on this message St and never promised us things to be easier two things to be very normal or everything appearing or everything good no he never promised or he never promised a Bed of Roses could be there could be challenges there could be problems there would be sicknesses would be L but he promised Jeremiah when he walks through the fire when he walk through the water and I will be with you give your promise he promised to us that I will be with you until the coming of the Lord I just want to encourage you my sister my brother whatever you never form God will reward nobody may not reward you Church may not reward government may not reward but God whom you that God whom you serve let me encourage my young brother decide to serve go he will reward you amen amen you remember she was never promised anything never promised anything fromi now Naomi is a widow her husband her children Di and she doesn't have anything she had to go back to her

physical blessings but God is there to provide according to his riches in Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah but now when she decided there was nothing good there was nothing good there was nothing good she had to decide young sisters and young Brothers the time that you decide to follow Jesus this is your time this is your opportunity actually the prophet would tell us the age we living in the evil God

their lws in in numbers you have a and you are harvesting it is their custom their to leave the remaining God told them don't don't take everything remain some for the poor So based on that Ruth used to come to the land now now uh he saw her ging and she found favor before him and he told the servants amen he told the servants please for this one for this one leave a little more little more more give her more but he comes to her and tells her for you never go to a neighboring Farm never go to another land continue ging from him Hallelujah huj when he came to the message we are not here to look a in there we are here our God the God we Ser will bless us where we are [Applause] he will bless us in a position he positions us Prophet said we have a position in Christ Jesus in the body of Christ nobody will take nobody will take your position your position in a god-given position that position nobody will take it God will come to reward you in the he [Applause] you you know I'm a preacher I'm not speaker I'm not a speaker I preach because the Bible is preached by power yes so be with me my brother sometimes when something strikes me be with me so that the people can be beneficiary of that amen amen hallelujah hallelujah how many happy today amen so she told he told her don't move from here there Prophet would preach why people to about message the prophet preach why people to about move here here and there why do they move him from here and there do they compare people why do they compare ministers for God s the same Prophet to believe in he told us there is a position for you in the kingdom of God and you serve God in the position you are given in the God you are serving will bless you in the same position you are standing hallelujah hallelujah now she never knew she never understood that one day this same same ground the same land she ging from is going to be never knew the God that you are serving you'll be part of him to him that overc to him that overc to him that overcome it I grant to sit in my I overcame upon my father's and the service that service we are serving the reward the service we serving God in this flesh word comes serving God is in this flesh salvation is in this flesh hallelujah hallelujah that is why that is why the temped flesh why why why my Revelation ising me amen you know Prophet told us that Jesus Christ the Bible says Jesus Christ he who knew sin he became sin for us but for us when he came to this world we bypass that now we bypassed that for him he he in that body glorified body we also have that body in him but when he came to this world we bypassed it and we were born in this flesh for this flesh to be tempted and for you and I to be able to say overcome this flesh and ser God when Ser God in this flesh in this physical flesh there is a reward in heaven for because God is aware that the devil can use also this he is aware he is aware that God is aware God is aware that the devil also use this same place but he told us in the Bible that we don't have two masters we only have one master we don't use two masters we don't have two masters our Master is one the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ and he PS us back and he PS us back amen amen praise God so the Bible tells us before we reach there so boy has redeemed her you know the story when she was redeemed she possessed that land she was ging from amen she became the owner hallelujah hallelujah first she decided then she served then while was going through to redeem her the process of serving her the process of redeeming her she was rested after rest there is Award of reward of redemption bo bo redeemed her to be his bride Jesus we know that we are that stone that we are healed from the Big Stone he he My Cat From The Big Stone that we came from him and we are going back to him that Christ That Rock of Ages we come from him and we are going back to him we are the stone that we are healed you see that rock Christ we we are healed healing means just cut and came out of that and we are going back to our place in Christ Jesus this message this message came to bring us back to our original Foundation where are we before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so every man receives the things he has done in this flesh that the Bible tells us in Romans 2:6 you rer render every man according to his deed Romans 2: who render to every man according to his deed in this flesh the deed is in this flesh we are running with God as as long as there is an opportunity actually I was so amazed when our mom was telling us yesterday that there was an elder there was an elder who believed this message when he was 0 90 years old in this church and he was always wishing and he was always wishing and he had the opportunity to believe the message when he was still young you have an opportunity you have an opportunity my young girl sister you have an opportunity amen you have a chance you have a chance to serve God hallelujah hallelujah so that the vers that we read amen the vers that we read that by election by election that God calls Abraham we know that God calls Abraham from his family from his tender and brings him to the land that he is never knew before and he promises him I will multiply you I will multiply the of Heaven the ground my English for you it's okay okay so God gives him a promise and the promise does not seem that happening now the prophet would tell us when God told him make your fathers of nation people used to Mo at him adversaries mothers and fathers of nation but there is nothing now Prophet tell us that look at this man father of nation mother of nation actually there was nothing they were wondering should we go back to the world but he who he made the promise at any time at any point come he make it pass come to [Applause] pass is working in the community like you he had a promise of being father of Nations but being mocked out being mocked but he never sted as the promises that God has given but by faith he knew and believed that God will fulfill his promises now Prophet will say that now they continued they've carried Theo of that decision and I want to tell you this to the Young Generation sah reproach for the sake of Christ that reproach Prophet would say she was bar it's not like a physical barness we're talking about here we speaking about spiritual matters she was bar she carried the reproach of barness meaning you carried the reproach of deciding to follow Jesus they will mock at you you are foolish in this 21 century you are foolish when you are supposed to watch football when you supposed to go to the world walk around around the next of God you Beck for deciding Ser Jesus to live a clean life you be more but sah she carried the reproach of barness and now that reproach later on later on fruit came there Prophet would say first then you know that it out fast then you can pull it out it's in the message you can display it then fruit I have it but it's not in my not today barness first then fruit yes yeah the reproach in that message the reproach for the cause of Christ can display it for them means without fruit reproach for the sake of Christ then yes yeah then now she was baren of course physically we don't understand that but God has given the promise but Prophet would come and because you have carried that reproach and the fruit comes thereof after that now whatever we do for the sake of the lord we may be mocked at that is a reproach we are carrying for the sake of Christ then our God because we have stood with him identified with us is able to pay us back we Ser a God that rewards again hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah now we are seeing here that now God giv that son a promised son again comes to him sacrifice me to him to me AB would wake up in the morning to carry him morah to sacrifice the promised son and he would go there God yeah barness you see that you know you know the reproach for the cause of Christ of barness being scoffed and reproach of barness fast you see reproach of barness fast she was yeah yeah they had she had to stand the reproach of being bar for those years to stand all those words all smoke but God who gave the promise is faithful to come and ATO time at such time like this to some of them to some of us maybe today God is able to visit us it's a time of visitation because we serve God a god of now God of [Applause] today hallelujah hallelujah and now his face was tested you would want to sacrifice the boy but God says now that I seen I have provided the sacrifice lamb sacrific L and as soon as he was trying to sacrifice God saw it and Prophet would come and preach a message that he says face without work face is work is face expressed is work is work is face expressed and it Compares James and and Paul people apost PA and James they speak about the same man that Isam put himam say show me thy Work show me thy faith without works I'll show thee my faith by works I mean Paul would identify Abraham by Faith by faith Abraham believed it was counted right unto him you see two of themess the same person from the different point of view amen and Prophet would say the Bible being not un contradictory to each other he puts it right now verse 20 of jam say I mean Jam chapter 2 don't need to go there chapter two of James verse says faith without works is De you see faith without works is De if you say I have faith show me by works if you say I believe this message show me my Works what are the works thereof thereof meaning after what are the works that comes after the pH he would say was not Abraham Our Father Justified by what was was not Abraham our father was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar now Prophet tell us in that same message that James is emphasizing on Works watch it very well Prophet is say that James is emphasizing on works that fath without works de if you say I have Fai you say I believe this message show me by fa my work let me see the fruits let let us see the fruit that comes out of your faith actually the prophet would say fath to the believer is a revelation is revealed to you amen now James is emphasing on works but now PA in chapter four of Romans he would say for If Abraham was justified by works he's trying to justify AB by what by faith and [Music] alone yes we are coming to a point one is identifying him by works and the other one is identifying him by fa Alone by fa by you just say by and you are seated is a time that you need to Backle up raise up the standard tell us in Isaiah when the devil raises a standard ra stand above that it doesn't me that you are CED and God works for you and you playing the kingdom of God yes sir yes my sister by fa and by alone it's like very sharp there blade line very you know you can easily fall this side or the other side if you just say by alone it may put you maybe towards laziness be very careful there a and you play coming to serve God here Works work there are some who would say we listen from home in the comfort of our bed we can just listen the T only in the house no no no brother even for you to come to Church it [Applause] is is that Pastor is that true yes I appreciate I listen the TS in the house I listen the T in my car I listen the in the church maybe in the morning when it comes to the ppit yes sir these two men Prophet would say are talking the same these two men he say they are speaking about faith now PA is justifying Abraham by what in him list said very watch me Paul [Music] is explaining or defy by what God saw in abam by what by what God saw in abrahames is defining I mean Abraham by The Works men saw in are are we together catch it very well now PA is justifying Abraham by what God himself so in I mean in Abraham Abraham believed in God and it was counted right him and is justifying by what God saw in Abraham but now PA is justifying by what men saw in AB that why show me th works if you say I have favor show me my works what Abraham did on Mah people saw his face in if we say we believe in God we need to show people that we believe in [Applause] God Amen people that we live with they need to see they need to see your faith expressed in action but PA is defining justifying not by what people saw he's defining him only by what God saw but James you see Bible tells us tell us you are Epistles of all men we are Christ walking on Earth we are people see us people need to see our fa expressed by works and that work that work is expressed in this flesh and if you do it there is a reward for amen so Abraham believed God what God saw in him he believed it but when he went acting it is done that is what man saw in him do we have Christians today who can say Amen to this the same thing with us our works expresses what faith we have whether we are weak that's why Prophet would come and tell us we need to take out this wish wish born out wish wish born wish we and we put on back put on backbone amen amen now Faith Prophet tell us it is revelation you see it is revealed to you and that Revelation is given only to the El re reation is not for everybody Revelation is for the El Bible tells us a prophet will tell us that the Church of the Living God is built on Revelation on the Revelation that on the face of I mean on the faith that it is revealed to you tell in Matthew 16 called that I am some would call you this some would call you the so some would call you a miracle worker Miracle work one of the prophets but who do you call me now Jesus asking the disciples and Son of Jonah and you tell him th Jesus son of the Living God Christ Christ son of the living Godus say this one flesh and blood not red to you is my father to you Upon This Rock will build my church and the of the enemy not overcome Revelation is not to be overcome by the dev what makes you stand on the message the revelation of what you are in Christ that Revelation proph say how that Baptist Minister would come to him and he doesn't like he doesn't understand what Revelation is no Revelation is very important to the life of a Believer is bed on Revelation It Is by Revelation that we are here now and that it says that stone or Rock told that it is just the to of P the they would even build a church upon that the of it is Prophet would explain it is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is the church is buil on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you so this church is established on the understanding on the Revelation who Jesus Christ is amen am Prophet would say how Revelation is very very important how God has been very sensitive on how to keep this Revelation or to keep this gift this Revelation to the I mean to the to the to the bride would come and tell us that message that how the Revelation is come to me given to me come and tell you that there was another lady astronauts coming asking him on that he was born on sign but now that same message Prophet would say he many times would love would have killed himself he wanted to kill himself he even wanted to shoot himself but he could not he said God is protecting the gift meaning God is protecting the Revelation for the bride God is so sensitive God has been so protective for that Revelation that came from him to be protected until it reaches home so God didn't want Prophet to die carrying that gift carrying that revelation you see how important Revelation is he says one day I wanted to kill myself to take my own life he said the gun wouldn't go off and God took care of the gift what is that gift the reation denominations would say the gift of healing the gift of this and this and that but God was so careful he had you in mind this Revelation that is going to come through the prophet wouldn't you wouldn't miss it he had to make sure that it reach home so your fa on Revelation amen whenever God does anything in that message Prophet would say whenever God does anything he declared it in heaven whatever he declares it in heaven he brings it through his T the bride now what he declared it in heaven God gave it to the prophets that Revelation that restoration message God stored it in himing God stored it in him just like God says to I mean Joseph store this food for it going to be drought in the rest of Egyptians for seven years it whatever God declared in heaven he St it in the prophets hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so he had to make sure that Prophet not go not go away from the SE before he delivers full message full Revelation message full restoration message so you and I today we have the ability we have the ability we have the capacity get up and say wake up and say that Revelation is mine that restoration message is mine for my fa praise God are you happy or we stop here amen how many wants us to continue and he says and how Revelation is so important in the life of a Believer remember those smes the astronauts astronauts who are studying astronomy in India actually they are Hebrews Hebrews Hebrews studying astronomy the land of India and they are is they B PA bird P meaning their line the Lage is from the children of Noah and they are not they are not they are not Jewish they Hebrews jewi Jew Jew Jews are the children of Jacob are before thatl these things and they were studying the astronomy and they knew and they knew they knew it was revealed to them by re to come and worship to come and worship God king of Jew is born now tell us that it was revealed to them before even they begin the journey it was revealed to them so they understood it before they begin to the journey each of them brought him a gift based on Revelation brought him a gift a gift of gold they understood God is Da he is God in flesh he's not just any other child God in FL his loving character his loving character molded in Jesus Christ so they came following the star toship him we have come following the star him and they brought him gift Mir and fr and those these three in the life of Jesus God identifies his day it was revealed Fran meaning what they apply the the smoke he deserves sacrifices he he came here to sacrifice himself on the cross the mirror is shows that his death and Resurrection before he was even born it was revealed to them so they walked ration so they never now the Bible says they came and presented their gift and they worshiped him B never says they worshiped the star Bible never says they worshiped the the mother they found with Mary right they presented to the baby baby Jesus and they worshiped him it is Jesus and Jesus alone that deserves worship praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah now the prophet would continue by faith that sacrifice more excellent sacrifice sacrificed excellent sacrifice because it is revealed that the SE never came in through the flowers he understood it by [Music] Fai contined like that said prophet in that same message works his face expressed God Noah his Works was expressing to the people what his face was on what God Said would take amen his Works God told him rain is going to come and the flood is going to destroy the but him had faith on that and he Contin to work on that so the people understood what he said the works of Noah that's why he said his Works Express his Works was expressing to the people what his his face was and was on what God Said will take place amen so by Faith by faith and Revelation Faith Works by fa now remember Moses sending the 12 representations representation representations from the tribes to the land can and they went there they they came back with a with a testimony of no we cannot do it we cannot do it because in the land the land is good but they are G they cannot them hallelujah hallelujah the prophet would say by faith and works and jhua we can make it by faith what works we can make it we can make it this morning you can make it my brother you can make it my sister amen you are a child of God you are a child of the most high actually the prophet says that the children of God Israelites the children of the Covenant they never Lo lost their Covenant what they lost was their freedom they are Covenant people you are Covenant people I am a covenant person but maybe the devil might have tried to take away your fre but by faith and faith alone and our works we can [Applause] make that's why in that message Prophet preached 565 27 in that message Prophet would say what we need today is a wish born out brother you are an interpreter you know we we don't can I this when you are young we are energetic we have the energy of God in us we Ser the living [Applause] gods we take out the wish born out wish me very very you know when they greet my brother how are you brother how that's how you greet how are you ah this body is not dead brother I greet you God bless you my brother how are

me my mountains give it to me today I can overcome I amble because Christ the hope of glory now the prophet would say he said what we need today 21st of January 2024 what we need today is the wish born out and the backb put on amen amen the Lord bless you you are wonderful people hallelujah hallelujah but not all these things when it comes to Salvation Paul is very clear there is nothing we did or we we showed by works for for our salvation Salvation is by God and God Alone but the revelation of our Salvation is called faith faith we have in our Salvation because he has done the works of saving us from that it is revealed to us by faith our effort we can make it and God P us for that so isra never is lost only the freedom even us we were born under the prince of the power of air the devil is still there but we can make it we can say no to I'm aen child of God I am child of God I'm a child of the most high I will item Paul tell us in the Book of Romans chapter9 that salvation is not of works but according to the election is not of what is not of Works salvation that's why Pentecostals I'm very busy telling you there is nothing you do there only God yes when it comes to Sal saving our souls nothing we did not of works but according to him that he has elected us the foundation of the world to them them that he predestinate he called them now to be conformed to the image of the son he predestinated he called them he justified them he justified hallelujah hallelujah he glorified you are in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and he called you he justified you he glorified you praise God hallelujah hallelujah we are the children of the most high God and we me business when we are in the kingdom of God everything we do in this physical flesh whether good or bad whether good or bad it is the Judgment renders to us in the things that we did in this lifean our physical life remember when when I think in the I think they were in the in the other side AB I mean somebody tell them that let me go out I don't remember I don't have it with me now let me go out and tell myren these things that they may not have it the ruler now he's in the grave he said let me go tell myen no no no no no AB told him for them mes and Elijah are there your time is done so whether you do do good or bad it is in this in this flesh even to decide to be saved
