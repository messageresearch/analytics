[4:03] so you know
[4:05] God brother Bram tells us he had the
[4:09] three F
[4:14] purose so you know when you are talking
[4:17] about three fold
[4:20] purose there must be a first
[4:23] fold there must be a second
[4:26] F and then the third f the prophet says
[4:30] here Christ the Myster of God
[4:34] revealed
[4:35] notice God has had the three F purpose
[4:39] in this great mystery
[4:45] secret amen God in his great mystery
[4:52] secret that he had before the world
[4:55] began he has a threefold purpose in it
[5:01] are you together now amen he has three
[5:06] four but he didn't start it in
[5:09] time it is something that he had before
[5:12] the world
[5:14] began but as you know mystery got become
[5:21] Revelation by the teachings of the
[5:24] prophets and by the
[5:27] scriptures then we come to realize what
[5:30] this secret mystery
[5:33] is knowing and understanding
[5:37] it that's where we build the
[5:41] church this secr
[5:43] mystery he says here the first thing
[5:49] was God wanted to reveal himself to the
[5:55] people that's the first
[5:58] fall God stepping
[6:01] out and revealing himself to the
[6:06] people so
[6:08] knowing and understanding
[6:12] God is the first
[6:15] thought but not the
[6:17] last He makes himself known for a
[6:22] purpose he want to
[6:25] preeminence in his people in his church
[6:30] and this church here is the Messianic
[6:35] Kingdom amen why do we call it a
[6:38] Messianic
[6:39] Kingdom because he has called out a
[6:42] people that were
[6:45] heathens and Believers and bring them
[6:49] together and reveal himself to them as
[6:52] their
[6:54] Messiah to wash their
[6:56] sin and to restore unto them
[7:00] the life that they had
[7:02] lost by the sin of
[7:04] Adam are you together with me yes sir So
[7:09] He makes himself known for a
[7:13] purpose God didn't just
[7:16] come and stepped into the body of
[7:19] Christ and reveal himself as God just
[7:23] for the sake of
[7:25] it there was a
[7:28] purpose why God came in
[7:31] Christ amen secondly in the
[7:35] fault was preeminence in his body of
[7:42] Believers that is his bride that he
[7:45] might live in a
[7:48] people praise the Lord he doesn't come
[7:51] to reveal
[7:52] himself Place himself here and then the
[7:56] people are here that was not the
[7:59] purpose because if he's there and we are
[8:03] here he becomes an
[8:07] idol amen but when he came and revealed
[8:12] himself his purpose was to live in a
[8:18] people that's the second
[8:20] four God is revealed to un
[8:24] elect and immediately desires to take
[8:28] preeminence
[8:31] regardless of one's previous
[8:35] condition amen whether this man was a
[8:39] thief like zakas whether he was a
[8:43] murderer like sa whether he was an
[8:47] intellectual like Dr
[8:49] Luke when God reveals himself to an
[8:54] elect the purpose is that he wants to as
[8:58] a kingdom in your
[9:01] life he wants to have the
[9:04] preeminence amen praise the Lord now
[9:09] listen here he reveals himself to
[9:15] aut and his name is
[9:17] sa but when Saul is
[9:21] testifying in Galatians chapter 1 verse
[9:25] 15 he says but when it pleased
[9:30] God hallelujah this is not for sa
[9:35] only but is also for
[9:38] you it pleased God who separated you
[9:44] from your
[9:46] mother's and called you by his
[9:50] grace he was not
[9:53] looking at the good things that you have
[9:57] done he says I I am separating
[10:01] you from your mother's womb for a
[10:05] special
[10:06] purpose and I'm doing this by
[10:09] grace that I may manifest myself
[10:13] soul in your life is that
[10:16] amen verse
[10:18] 16 the purpose was to reveal his son in
[10:24] me amen not reveal his son to me
[10:30] but the son revealed to
[10:33] me must step on the inside of my
[10:37] life to have
[10:39] preeminence and then revealed through
[10:45] me are you together with me to reveal
[10:49] his son in
[10:51] me that I might preach him among the
[10:55] Heen immediately confer not with flesh
[10:59] Flesh and
[11:02] Blood this Revelation here cannot be
[11:08] negotiated are you together with me if
[11:11] God is revealed to
[11:12] you you don't confer with
[11:16] blood say oh do you think I should
[11:19] believe
[11:20] this no you just can't do that he Paul
[11:25] says I could confer with flesh and blood
[11:31] he did go back to
[11:33] Jerusalem to the headquarters of the
[11:37] priest and say excuse me there is an
[11:41] experience I
[11:43] had
[11:45] onas and then this Jesus spoke to me
[11:49] saying so should I believe
[11:53] him he says I confor not with flesh and
[11:57] blood
[11:59] a true Revelation to a
[12:02] Believer overrides what your friend can
[12:05] advise
[12:09] you excels beyond what the community can
[12:13] accept or discuss or
[12:20] debate Amen in verse
[12:23] 15 Paul talks of the calling of
[12:27] Grace but in
[12:29] 16 he speaks of God taking over the
[12:37] pinenes to reveal his son in
[12:41] me when you are
[12:44] called into the grace of God the purpose
[12:48] is that you become a
[12:50] vessel of the revelation of the goodness
[12:54] of
[12:56] God Amen am that that is Christ at the
[13:01] throne
[13:03] then and when he gets at the Throne of
[13:05] Our
[13:07] Lives it deems everything in our
[13:11] [Applause]
[13:13] lives
[13:18] amen when you look at the things you see
[13:21] seem to have
[13:24] love you start almost trying to find
[13:27] where they
[13:30] you start to ask where was the joy in
[13:36] this you start wondering because the
[13:39] revelation of Christ to
[13:42] you deems
[13:47] everything the other day I taken my
[13:51] car to a
[13:53] garage and this was this young
[13:56] man he was falling
[13:59] and
[14:00] rising in the early
[14:02] hours and he was
[14:07] saying and he's back again when the Lord
[14:11] Vis such a man he begins to ask where
[14:16] was the joy in
[14:20] this you see so Paul says I count all
[14:26] things but
[14:27] loss
[14:29] amen for the Excellence of the knowledge
[14:32] of Christ Jesus my
[14:37] Lord in order for you to know the Lord
[14:41] Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and
[14:45] enjoy it you have to count everything
[14:48] else
[14:51] lost you must allow everything to
[14:56] De when Christ met
[15:01] on the way to
[15:03] Damascus amen listen friends the light
[15:08] by which Paul was seeing
[15:11] things became
[15:14] Darkness the only light is when Christ
[15:18] opened his eyes
[15:22] again he closed his eyes to the
[15:26] worldall the sunshine became dark
[15:30] he couldn't see nothing and when his
[15:33] eyes got open he had a different look at
[15:38] things it's our prayer that we may have
[15:43] a different look at
[15:46] things is that amen so to a true
[15:50] Christian the calling of Grace must
[15:54] eventually establish a
[15:57] kingdom amen it must drop a kingdom life
[16:01] into
[16:03] you amen Paul says for I have suffered
[16:11] loss amen
[16:14] completely all the knowledge and the
[16:18] wisdom and the
[16:20] authority that
[16:22] so it became nothing and Christ became
[16:27] prominent
[16:29] in his own life amen so Christ in you
[16:35] becomes a kingdom when he takes the
[16:40] preeminence you
[16:43] seize and Christ takes
[16:46] over amen praise the Lord yes sir when
[16:51] Christ Steed into the life of John the
[16:55] Baptist John the Baptist says
[16:59] I must
[17:00] decrease that he may
[17:03] increase I know some of us are so
[17:08] smart
[17:10] intellectually we are special uh pieces
[17:14] in
[17:16] community amen but then when Christ is
[17:20] revealed to
[17:22] you there is something on the
[17:25] side that keeps telling you
[17:29] sees that Christ may have the
[17:34] preeminence you
[17:37] sees in your natural
[17:40] reason you allow
[17:43] Christ to take over your
[17:46] kingdom your life then is about
[17:51] church and the word maybe your work and
[17:57] family are you together with me a lot of
[18:01] these leure
[18:03] things where we think we are going to
[18:05] Resource
[18:07] Joy they begin to get dim before
[18:12] us where people are so
[18:16] gloomy and you know they are very
[18:19] sad because Arenal has
[18:27] lost and you say hello how are you they
[18:31] don't want to
[18:34] answer but once you have
[18:37] Christ the joy of the Lord is not
[18:43] seasonal it is
[18:45] permanent praise God when a man smites
[18:49] you on the
[18:51] face brother Bram says the lordship
[18:55] controls
[18:57] you
[18:59] amen your hand sees to be so
[19:04] fast when your
[19:06] wife there something you don't
[19:09] like the
[19:11] Lord the King on the
[19:14] inside takes
[19:17] control he takes control of your
[19:20] tongue amen how you talk to your wife
[19:24] how you talk to your husband there is a
[19:27] king
[19:29] he has
[19:30] preeminence he
[19:33] controls when someone says something
[19:37] about
[19:38] you the lordship of Christ in
[19:42] you takes
[19:45] control you are not your own
[19:48] anymore Christ has taken over your
[19:53] kingdom he has taken over your
[19:56] mind he has taken over your
[20:00] amen you now belong to a
[20:04] kingdom so when the doctor
[20:07] says I am
[20:09] sorry but my medical skill
[20:13] says You must die there's nothing more
[20:17] we can do but the lordship of
[20:21] Christ controls you by his word saying
[20:26] by his ch we will healed Hallelujah
[20:31] there is a
[20:33] ky praise God yes sir let me say this
[20:38] and this is very Prime in our
[20:42] series amen that God had
[20:50] [Music]
[20:53] understood but him the
[20:57] preeminence
[21:00] makes him an
[21:03] idol because an idol is a powerless
[21:10] God are you together with me the purpose
[21:14] of this
[21:16] Revelation the mystery
[21:19] secret is reveal himself to the
[21:23] people so that he can have the
[21:27] preeminence
[21:28] not to reveal himself to the
[21:32] knowledge so that you may
[21:35] understand that there is one
[21:37] God but the purpose of the
[21:40] Revelation is for him to have
[21:44] preeminence amen how I desire would say
[21:48] I mean sing and
[21:50] [Music]
[21:51] say I surrender
[21:55] all amen got my hands
[22:00] full but I surrender
[22:04] all I don't want to be like a rich young
[22:08] ruler who wanted to have it
[22:11] all and still have
[22:15] Christ you have your
[22:18] pleasures
[22:21] entertainment all kinds of
[22:23] friends they make a big portion of your
[22:26] life
[22:28] and on top of that you want to include
[22:32] Christ he says no through where your
[22:36] reaches and then come and follow me amen
[22:41] so I surrender
[22:44] all no longer I but Christ that liveth
[22:48] in me is allowing him to build the
[22:53] kingdom amen when he revealed himself to
[22:56] Ezekiel
[22:58] he took the
[23:00] preeminence he did not allow Ezekiel to
[23:03] be
[23:04] here and then he's just watching
[23:08] something over
[23:10] there whenever God is
[23:13] revealed and is revealed to man he
[23:17] involves
[23:18] man into that
[23:20] Revelation when he revealed himself to
[23:24] Moses Amen on Mount hor told him remove
[23:28] your
[23:29] shoes the place where he standing is the
[23:33] holy Place praise God you catch a
[23:37] revelation you explain the godhead but
[23:41] you don't allow God to have the
[23:44] preeminence that is not God he remains
[23:48] an
[23:51] idol when he revealed himself to
[23:54] Ezekiel he took
[23:56] preeminence when you read the whole
[23:59] chapter
[24:01] one and then
[24:03] Ezekiel is in a
[24:06] presence he says I saw the visions of
[24:09] God and then when he gets to verse
[24:13] 28 he says this was the appearance of
[24:16] the likeness of the glory of the
[24:21] Lord and when I saw it I fell upon my
[24:26] face and I had a voice of one that
[24:30] SP this Revelation here bring Mission
[24:36] and brings in a
[24:40] voice are you together with me he says
[24:44] when I say I fell to my
[24:49] face amen there
[24:51] submission hallelujah hallelujah when he
[24:54] revealed himself to Daniel Daniel
[24:57] chapter
[24:59] verse
[25:00] 8 praise God he says therefore I was
[25:04] left
[25:06] alone and saw this great
[25:09] vision and there remain no strength in
[25:12] me from my
[25:14] cess was turned me into
[25:18] corruption and I retained no
[25:21] strength yet had the voice of his
[25:26] word my
[25:29] God are you together with me he says yes
[25:34] I heard the
[25:36] voice of his word the revelation of God
[25:41] will always cause you to submit to
[25:44] him and will have the
[25:48] preeminence you will hear his voice you
[25:51] hear his
[25:53] instructions amen when he reveals
[25:56] himself to John
[25:59] in Revelation
[26:01] 1 verse
[26:03] 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet
[26:09] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[26:12] me saying unto
[26:17] me praise the Lord when you have the
[26:21] ability to
[26:24] explain the fullness of the goded B in
[26:30] Christ and it has no influence over
[26:35] you then that is a definition of an
[26:42] idol but the god that we
[26:45] serve when he gets revealed to you he
[26:49] takes over the
[26:50] [Music]
[26:52] preeminence that's the
[26:54] purpose praise God when you know him by
[26:58] Revelation when you know him other
[27:02] way amen that's different but when you
[27:06] know him by
[27:07] Revelation he takes over the
[27:11] preeminence he begins to control our
[27:14] Liv praise God he speaks to us by the
[27:20] word amen and you know
[27:23] sometimes excuse me
[27:26] sometimes listen to me friends we are in
[27:31] church
[27:33] because we have a friend in
[27:37] church and once you were in
[27:40] church simply because you are a friend
[27:43] in you have a
[27:45] friend listen then you are in the
[27:49] category of
[27:51] [Music]
[27:54] lot because lot entered
[27:59] can because of his uncle
[28:03] Abraham are you together with me and so
[28:07] when lot got in
[28:10] there he found out he didn't have an
[28:15] inheritance and then he began to
[28:19] fight his uncle for
[28:23] inheritance all these War you see in
[28:26] church
[28:28] is people have
[28:29] comeing and they have no
[28:33] inheritance they are trying to have
[28:35] something they can lay a hand
[28:39] on are you together with me so you find
[28:43] that you are in the category of
[28:49] lot but if you had the
[28:54] call he ended up becoming
[28:59] submissive to the almighty
[29:02] God and also subject to the
[29:06] word amen the
[29:11] first is God revealing
[29:14] himself the second for is God having
[29:20] preeminence amen so there was a man by
[29:24] calling he was a prophet his name was
[29:30] Isaiah but you see his
[29:34] life
[29:35] amen Was A God Called
[29:40] Prophet but there the C of a holy man
[29:43] before
[29:46] him and that holy man was
[29:52] called and you
[29:55] know is the King who has got the history
[29:59] to have ruled the nation of Israel for
[30:02] longer years than even D of
[30:09] [Music]
[30:12] Solomon and he was a very kind of
[30:15] successful
[30:17] King and his life was
[30:22] meticulous amen so when Isaiah came to
[30:28] church the life of that
[30:31] man mized him so
[30:34] much he couldn't go beyond that
[30:39] curtain and that's a very big
[30:43] problem when brother Bram was preaching
[30:46] on the different messages on the
[30:50] influence he was always taking the
[30:53] subject of
[30:55] Isaiah amen
[30:57] and you know it talks about
[31:00] Isaiah who had a c before
[31:03] him and so brother BR was preaching
[31:07] those messages in such a way that he may
[31:12] tell the people that I don't want to
[31:14] become your
[31:18] C amen so at the end of the
[31:23] services he would always turn his
[31:26] back and then he says see see who is
[31:30] this one he says that's the one who
[31:34] visited
[31:35] Abraham in
[31:37] M you know he had his back turned to the
[31:41] tent but he had the ability of seeing
[31:45] sah and say why did
[31:49] sah and then as he turns out here he
[31:53] would say you come from such and such a
[31:55] place you you got such and such a
[31:59] problem you've seen such a number of
[32:02] doctors your name is so and so you live
[32:06] in a mountaineous
[32:08] country so that he can help them to
[32:12] understand that this is not
[32:15] him this is
[32:20] God are you together with me so let's
[32:24] look at Isaiah here a little bit
[32:28] now if you fall into the category of
[32:32] Isaiah and it's honestly that God has
[32:35] called
[32:37] you and you really feel that you have
[32:40] got a touch of God upon your
[32:45] life but somehow
[32:48] somewhere you are under the
[32:51] control of the
[32:53] leadership of a man or a woman you
[32:56] admire
[32:58] this man could be your
[33:01] father this woman could be your wife
[33:06] may but then you
[33:09] need to come to a point where you look
[33:14] Beyond
[33:16] him and have access to
[33:21] Christ listen to what Isaiah
[33:25] says in Isaiah chapter 6
[33:29] verse1 in
[33:34] theing this wonderful
[33:36] King I saw also the
[33:42] Lord amen he had never had a person
[33:47] experience but the year that King
[33:52] is I saw
[33:55] also the Lord sitting on a
[33:58] throne high and lifted up and this train
[34:02] filled the
[34:05] temple God revealing himself to
[34:09] isah and
[34:12] immediately
[34:13] Isaiah realized that he needed
[34:18] justification he needed
[34:21] sanctification he needed the Bas of the
[34:23] Holy Ghost and he needed to be blessed
[34:26] in the body
[34:29] because immediately after
[34:32] that amen then verse five
[34:36] says then
[34:40] say is
[34:42] me for I
[34:45] am because I am a man of unlean
[34:50] lips my company is a bad
[34:54] one amen and I dwell in the M of a PE of
[34:59] un
[35:01] clean yet my eyes have seen the
[35:06] king the Lord of
[35:08] hosts the company
[35:11] kep had a
[35:15] reflection on his
[35:19] character some of the things we
[35:23] do is we a part of church
[35:28] but outside there we've got another
[35:33] [Music]
[35:35] influence Isaiah says who unto
[35:39] me now that I have seen
[35:43] God I desire to take
[35:48] sanctification amen is that amen for
[35:52] everybody that God May touch you
[35:57] [Music]
[35:59] amen touch your
[36:01] lips sometimes our lips are never
[36:06] shut we start saying
[36:09] things every
[36:14] time there was a place where I was with
[36:17] my
[36:18] wife nice quiet home nice quiet nice
[36:22] quiet
[36:24] home amen the was
[36:28] wonderful but then came in this young
[36:32] man he never stops he
[36:37] was I said since this young man
[36:42] came he can't keep
[36:45] quiet and he was a music
[36:50] instructor amen and this is a singing
[36:54] family so he started now on the
[36:57] music when the music is over
[37:03] still sometimes when you speak a
[37:06] lot you forget what you
[37:12] said and people will start
[37:15] fearing because you even deny the very
[37:18] things you
[37:21] said did I say
[37:25] that I don't think I am
[37:30] mad he says I sit in the compan of men
[37:33] with unclean
[37:36] lips you if God is going to help
[37:40] us we must accept our
[37:44] weakness Isaiah says my
[37:48] problem I've got un
[37:51] clean and I company together with men of
[37:54] unlean Li
[37:58] and when he said like that down
[38:03] came Amen in verse six unto me having a
[38:10] life call in his
[38:13] hand which had taken with the tong from
[38:16] the off the
[38:18] alt and he laid it upon my
[38:22] mouth and said
[38:24] Lord this has touched that
[38:26] [Music]
[38:27] lips and iniquity is taken
[38:32] away and th
[38:35] sin he needed a
[38:38] p needed to be made
[38:41] clear but you see all this cannot
[38:45] come until you have come into
[38:49] presence when you come into
[38:52] presence you can't stand with your
[38:55] arrogance
[38:57] you cannot stand there with pointing
[39:01] fingers all the men who have come into
[39:04] that
[39:05] presence they've always
[39:08] testified that they felt their
[39:14] face and Daniel said my came to
[39:20] nothing his
[39:22] Holiness became
[39:25] nothing praise God but sometimes we come
[39:29] to
[39:29] church and our
[39:33] job is to keep judging one
[39:37] another pointing to one
[39:39] another once you have the
[39:42] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:44] you'll always point to
[39:50] yourself Lord have Mery upon me Lord
[39:54] give me the grace that I need
[39:57] amen he says here in verse
[40:01] eight also I heard the
[40:04] voice of the Lord say shall
[40:09] I go for
[40:12] usby send
[40:15] me that is
[40:17] revelation and
[40:21] preeminence are you together with me God
[40:24] revealing himself to
[40:27] man and then taking the
[40:31] preeminence the three F
[40:35] purpose that's the
[40:37] order upon which God wants to receive
[40:42] you he wants to reveal himself to
[40:45] you and then he wants also to have
[40:50] preeminence he wants to exercise
[40:53] control based on obedience to the
[40:57] word amen praise God so God always
[41:03] desires to inhabit a
[41:06] tabernacle because God in a
[41:10] tabernacle becomes a Messianic
[41:14] Kingdom because it takes
[41:17] control a king
[41:19] rules a king
[41:22] governs a King
[41:25] Controls a king sets everything in
[41:30] order so when God becomes the
[41:34] king of the Messianic
[41:37] Kingdom it doesn't come as a
[41:42] decoration he says I have come down here
[41:45] to take over your
[41:49] life did you hear that amen so God
[41:55] always desires
[41:58] to inhabit his
[41:59] Tabernacle let us go and look at the
[42:02] Kingdom
[42:03] Here Acts chapter
[42:06] one are you still there somebody say
[42:10] amen amen AMS 1 verse
[42:15] 2 until the
[42:18] day in which he was taken
[42:23] up after that he
[42:26] through the Holy Ghost had given
[42:33] Commandments the apostles whom he had
[42:37] chosen to whom also he showed himself
[42:42] alive after his Passion by many
[42:49] proofs being seen of them 40 days after
[42:52] the
[42:55] resurrection and speaking of things
[42:58] pertaining to the kingdom of
[43:03] God he's revealing
[43:06] himself and he's
[43:09] speaking Revelation to
[43:12] you and then he's now placing them into
[43:20] Kingdom and for 40 days after the
[43:24] resurrection he speaking to them about
[43:27] the
[43:30] Kingdom so this day was we are talking
[43:33] about in scripture
[43:36] here is the Day of His
[43:40] Ascension and he spent the
[43:43] speaking of the Messianic
[43:47] Kingdom but the
[43:49] disciples mix this
[43:52] information with the political Kingdom
[43:55] of Israel
[43:59] is talking about a messic
[44:02] kingdom but they are talking about the
[44:05] Kingdom of
[44:08] Israel but
[44:10] remember after the Kings of Israel
[44:14] failed there was not another political
[44:18] Kingdom of Israel
[44:24] promise but the mess
[44:27] Kingdom and
[44:28] thereafter would come the millennial
[44:32] Kingdom the rule of Christ here on
[44:35] Earth Thousand
[44:38] Years amen so in Acts chapter
[44:44] 1 when they therefore will come
[44:49] together all the
[44:51] apostles they asked him
[44:54] saying
[44:56] God will thou at this time restore again
[45:00] the Kingdom of
[45:04] Israel he says I'm going I'll come back
[45:09] the same way you see me go is the same
[45:12] way I'm going to
[45:21] come when they asked about the
[45:24] kingdom
[45:26] you might think like he didn't
[45:28] understand
[45:31] them he understood them but he pointed
[45:35] them to the B of the Holy Ghost
[45:41] in because the B of the Holy
[45:44] Ghost is the
[45:46] creation of the Messianic
[45:49] Kingdom he's saying that my intention is
[45:53] here my intention is here
[45:57] it's not on the political
[46:00] Kingdom I'm going to build the kingdom
[46:03] Out of
[46:04] You by the bom of the Holy
[46:09] Ghost so then
[46:12] immediately he takes them to verse
[46:15] eight and he says but ye shall receive
[46:20] power after that the Holocaust has come
[46:23] upon
[46:24] you and it shall be Witnesses unto
[46:28] me both in Jerusalem and in Juda and in
[46:34] Samaria and the uttermost parts of the
[46:40] earth so the
[46:45] witness comes by the bosom of the Hool
[46:49] ghost that's
[46:51] God revealing himself to you then having
[46:56] the
[46:57] preeminence and once he takes the
[47:00] preeminence the life you live by the B
[47:04] of the Holy Ghost becomes your
[47:08] testimony are you together with me the
[47:11] life we
[47:12] live by the Holy Ghost taking
[47:16] preeminence is the testimony of the
[47:21] kingom praise the Lord so the Bas the
[47:26] Holy
[47:27] Ghost places us into Messianic
[47:33] Kingdom they asked about the natural
[47:37] Kingdom and in he gave them the Holy
[47:41] Ghost to B them into a different nature
[47:44] of
[47:47] Kingdom so let's go to the book of St
[47:50] Luke chapter
[47:54] 17
[47:58] verse 20
[48:00] says and when he was demanded of the
[48:04] [Music]
[48:06] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[48:10] come he answered them and
[48:14] said the kingdom of
[48:17] God cometh not with
[48:20] observation neither shall they say la
[48:24] here or La there
[48:28] behold the kingdom of God is within
[48:36] you praise the Lord the kingdom of
[48:40] God is within
[48:43] you praise the Lord amen Christ is being
[48:52] specific I see kids on the other side I
[48:55] don't whether there is anybody taking
[49:00] care amen Christ is being
[49:04] specific he's saying that there cannot
[49:07] be AAL
[49:12] Kingdom amen without first the holy
[49:16] ghost
[49:17] coming into the hearts of men and
[49:21] prepare them
[49:24] first
[49:26] so the Holy Ghost
[49:28] comes to prepare us for the
[49:32] miranium which is a thousand year
[49:36] rule but at this time listen to me he
[49:41] says I first of all build the
[49:44] kingdom within you
[49:48] first first it has to be the
[49:52] kingdom of the B of the Holy Ghost the
[49:55] Holy Ghost
[49:57] therefore baptizes you into
[50:01] kingdom are you together with me when
[50:04] you receive the B of the Holy
[50:07] Ghost you are baptized into the
[50:11] [Music]
[50:13] kingdom we receive a kingdom that cannot
[50:16] be
[50:18] moved when all these worldly kingdoms
[50:21] are
[50:22] falling and the whole world is falling
[50:27] we are
[50:29] baptized into the kingdom that cannot be
[50:34] M we receive a
[50:37] kingdom and this
[50:39] kingdom is the mystical Body of
[50:46] Christ amen and the life of this
[50:50] kingdom is Christ in you the hope of
[50:54] glory
[50:57] that's the
[50:58] kingdom Paul says when Christ who is our
[51:04] life shall
[51:05] appear then shall he appear with him in
[51:11] glory somebody say Amen there amen now
[51:15] you're there praise the Lord he says
[51:18] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[51:22] the kingdom show us the kingdom says the
[51:25] kingdom is in you because the king came
[51:29] into your soul by the B of the Holy
[51:33] Ghost where the king is he controls the
[51:40] kingdom brother Bram says like I was
[51:43] talking to some
[51:45] people they said
[51:48] well what church you belong
[51:52] to I said I don't belong
[51:56] what denomination you belong

[52:11] kingdom are you together with me do you
[52:14] belong to a kingdom

[52:19] kingdom and by one
[52:22] Spirit we are baptized into that
[52:26] kingom by one spirit all into this
[52:31] Kingdom Jesus say pray thy kingdom
[52:37] come thy will be done on Earth as it is
[52:42] in heaven amen then the kingdom is built
[52:47] in
[52:48] you amen the Holy Ghost baptizing us
[52:52] into the
[52:54] kingdom and therefore if the Holocaust
[52:58] baptizes us into
[53:00] Kingdom we must
[53:02] learn to live as a
[53:07] kingdom are you together with me we must
[53:11] learn to live as a
[53:14] kingdom the Holy Ghost cannot baptize
[53:19] you into
[53:23] isolation no sir the Holy Ghost baptizes
[53:27] into a
[53:29] kingdom you become a part of the
[53:32] Kingdom praise God listen to what the
[53:36] prophet says now in the Old
[53:39] Testament the know
[53:41] church was called the kingdom of
[53:45] God God's
[53:48] kingdom that's
[53:50] Israel that was the
[53:53] church as as Steven
[53:56] says the church in the
[54:00] wilderness because the church
[54:03] means a people that have been called
[54:07] out into something else you have been
[54:11] called out from all forms of
[54:16] unbelief and we have come into the
[54:19] world to make a word
[54:23] Kingdom amen
[54:25] so I'm taking this from chronology of
[54:29] the Bible brother Bram
[54:34] say the Old Testament the church was
[54:37] called the kingdom of
[54:40] God in other words God is a
[54:44] king and the church is his
[54:48] domain God's
[54:51] kingdom amen the church
[54:55] is his
[54:57] domain amen so when we are under
[55:01] King we must
[55:04] learn to live as a
[55:07] kingdom amen you see the
[55:11] church is the people of God that have
[55:15] been called out of the
[55:17] world to serve in another
[55:21] kingdom so you get into the kingdom you
[55:24] are saying Lord show me my
[55:28] position in the body of the
[55:31] Kingdom what am I going to do am I a
[55:34] prayer
[55:35] Warrior am I here to show
[55:39] sympathy let me help
[55:43] people let me go and pray with the
[55:45] Brethren who are
[55:48] sick what's my
[55:50] position in the body yes sir because
[55:55] because in the Kingdom everybody has
[55:58] something to
[56:00] do you know people want to go to a
[56:04] heaven where they are not going to do
[56:08] anything there you are going to be there
[56:12] for only three and a half
[56:13] years after that you will come back
[56:20] here and you are going to live a life
[56:24] and you going going to be
[56:26] subject as a
[56:28] kingdom let me tell you
[56:31] friends this
[56:33] Redemption is the
[56:36] restoration of where Adam fell
[56:44] from Adam tended the world the
[56:49] Earth we are coming back to
[56:53] that and I'm praying that God gives me
[56:56] the best
[56:58] spot in the
[57:00] [Music]
[57:03] millenum are you together with me yeah
[57:07] because we are being
[57:10] restored to Adam before the
[57:14] [Music]
[57:18] fall that's why there is an earth to
[57:23] Tender
[57:25] for some of you are
[57:27] saying go and study brother bram's
[57:31] message things that are to
[57:36] be things that are to
[57:40] [Music]
[57:43] be praise the Lord so the church is a
[57:48] people of God that's been called out of
[57:53] the world in another
[57:58] kingdom we must be doing something for
[58:01] the
[58:03] Lord you don't just come down here and
[58:07] enjoy the preaching of the
[58:09] pastor and then you go home and you say
[58:13] thank God that was good
[58:18] preaching you are called to serve in the
[58:23] kingdom and those are the things we
[58:25] shall keep going
[58:27] through listen to what he says now
[58:31] Israel was the people of
[58:39] God until that then they were called The
[58:43] Church of God when they were called
[58:47] out because they were called by God out
[58:51] of
[58:53] Egypt out of of the
[58:55] world away from other
[58:58] churches out away from other
[59:02] religions to walk with God
[59:08] alone and now the Church of God
[59:12] today is the same
[59:14] thing called out of everything of the
[59:19] world called out of every religious
[59:23] C out of every religious
[59:27] denomination out of every religious
[59:32] organization with
[59:35] God not being governed by a
[59:39] bishop but being governed by
[59:42] Christ in this Messianic
[59:46] Kingdom that we live in Christ is the
[59:50] king Christ is the word now Christ is
[59:54] the head of this Messianic
[59:57] Kingdom and you cannot organize a
[1:00:06] kingdom of which Christ is the
[1:00:09] head you cannot to denominate the
[1:00:13] kingdom which Christ is the
[1:00:18] head hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we
[1:00:22] come out
[1:00:25] everything we come out of our
[1:00:29] drugs we come out of our
[1:00:33] drinking we come out of for
[1:00:36] teaching to come in here not to
[1:00:41] continue but to get
[1:00:43] under the control and Leadership of
[1:00:48] Jehovah
[1:00:49] God Amen to Humble
[1:00:53] ourselves like a
[1:00:55] eel I went down to my face the Arrogant
[1:01:00] Spirits not have a place in the
[1:01:04] Messianic
[1:01:05] Kingdom because that means God does not
[1:01:09] have PR
[1:01:13] [Music]
[1:01:14] yet Israel is the Shad of this Messianic
[1:01:20] Kingdom listen to some of the facts
[1:01:25] Israel was called
[1:01:29] out and God was in
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:35] their and
[1:01:37] Israel was not one
[1:01:40] tribe no sir every Tri
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:46] had pointing to their position in the
[1:01:52] body Judah had the answer
[1:01:55] of a lion of the tribe of Judah showing
[1:02:00] he was the
[1:02:01] king every Tri was given some
[1:02:07] families to lead
[1:02:11] them you see when we come to make this
[1:02:16] Messianic
[1:02:18] Kingdom we are subjecting
[1:02:21] ourselves to the institutions
[1:02:25] that God has ordained in the
[1:02:32] church are you there amen you see like I
[1:02:39] say Israel was not one
[1:02:42] tribe it was a nation of 12
[1:02:46] tribes so this Kingdom Here cannot be
[1:02:50] one local
[1:02:52] church no sir it's is many churches but
[1:02:56] they have been
[1:02:58] baptized into this Messianic
[1:03:01] Kingdom Hallelujah and the tribe was not
[1:03:06] one person but many people are you
[1:03:10] together with me when we come to church
[1:03:13] we are not one we are many people but
[1:03:18] every one of us has a position in the
[1:03:21] body of
[1:03:23] Christ
[1:03:25] and when Christ said the kingdom is
[1:03:30] within
[1:03:31] you he meant that this baptism must
[1:03:36] place you into a body of Believers for
[1:03:45] service you are not baptized in
[1:03:52] isolation are you together with with me
[1:03:55] we are baptized into the
[1:04:00] kingdom when he says that kingdom is
[1:04:03] within
[1:04:04] you he was not talking about one
[1:04:08] man he was talking about the body of
[1:04:12] believer the kingdom is within you so
[1:04:16] when the Hool ghost
[1:04:18] baptizes as an individual he brings you
[1:04:22] into
[1:04:23] body
[1:04:24] amen amen amen the Messianic
[1:04:28] kingdom is God putting his bread
[1:04:33] together throughout the seven Church
[1:04:36] ages to work a
[1:04:40] work where you would have preeminence in
[1:04:44] them before taking them back into
[1:04:48] a because that's the third
[1:04:52] fa to walk his bright
[1:04:56] back so he had that secret mystery yeah
[1:05:00] had that secret
[1:05:04] mystery he had it from before the
[1:05:08] foundation of the world that I will
[1:05:12] reveal
[1:05:13] myself and then preeminence in
[1:05:18] men when they have
[1:05:20] fallen then I will redeem them and walk
[1:05:24] them
[1:05:26] back into Ed are you together with
[1:05:33] me the threefold
[1:05:37] mystery amen amen so in the New
[1:05:42] Testament God reveals himself by
[1:05:49] manifestation if God Is On th
[1:05:53] side makes himself
[1:05:57] no
[1:05:58] amen this life
[1:06:01] here manifest certain different
[1:06:05] virtues to reflect the presence of
[1:06:09] Jehovah you have standing
[1:06:13] Faith amen you are not
[1:06:16] wavering your faith is not controlled by
[1:06:22] circumstances brother so and so has done
[1:06:25] this so I'm going away from the
[1:06:29] church no sir you have got a standing
[1:06:33] Faith Upon This
[1:06:36] Rock I build my church and the gifts of
[1:06:40] Hell cannot Prevail
[1:06:43] against standing
[1:06:46] Revelation amen and out of that fa there
[1:06:51] proceedeth
[1:06:53] virtue praise God Amen because what you
[1:06:58] believe is not dead
[1:07:03] knowledge but it has a life the word
[1:07:07] revealed has life in
[1:07:09] itself and proceed as
[1:07:13] knowledge which is holy ghost
[1:07:16] knowledge praise God you begin to
[1:07:20] understand
[1:07:21] things according to what God
[1:07:24] desires you to know out of that then
[1:07:29] proceed as
[1:07:31] Temperance man's
[1:07:33] Faith his faith will produce
[1:07:37] V Hallelujah that V will produce
[1:07:41] knowledge and that knowledge we help you
[1:07:44] to to
[1:07:46] stand with
[1:07:49] Temperance in times when you are
[1:07:52] second hallelujah hallelujah you will
[1:07:55] have Holy Ghost
[1:07:58] tempers praise God when bad times come

[1:08:08] prayer that means God has already taken
[1:08:13] resence in the kingdom and God is
[1:08:17] governing Hallelujah because in the New
[1:08:22] Testament God wants to reveal
[1:08:25] himself by
[1:08:28] manifestation not I've seen a light
[1:08:31] here all I've been shaking here the New
[1:08:35] Testament
[1:08:40] quer are you together with me in the
[1:08:44] Kingdom God reveals
[1:08:47] himself amen so God gives the
[1:08:52] Revelation to John
[1:08:55] so that he could show it unto God's
[1:09:00] servants and this
[1:09:02] Revelation is not the simple
[1:09:06] knowledge that Jesus is
[1:09:08] God no
[1:09:11] sir this Revelation here is God
[1:09:15] revealing by
[1:09:17] manifestation amen if he has revealed
[1:09:20] himself to
[1:09:21] you where's the preeminence
[1:09:27] that should always be our
[1:09:30] question and we should always
[1:09:33] desire to come to the
[1:09:36] ultimate and be able to
[1:09:39] manifest the presence of God in his
[1:09:43] kingdom amen you remember that black
[1:09:48] fellow he says I not what I want to be
[1:09:54] but I thank God I'm not what I used to
[1:09:59] be there is something working in
[1:10:03] you you may not be so much
[1:10:06] aware but I know God is working a
[1:10:10] work amen he has kept you under his
[1:10:15] word one year two years 5 years 10 years
[1:10:22] he's doing a work
[1:10:24] and one of these days praise God you are
[1:10:28] going to come to the
[1:10:30] stat amen of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] praise God so this
[1:10:36] Revelation deals with God revealing his
[1:10:44] person amen together with his
[1:10:47] words in the journe of the seven Church
[1:10:52] ages that's what brother Bram told
[1:10:55] us in the seven Church
[1:10:57] ages that this Revelation here is not
[1:11:01] just the revelation of the
[1:11:05] person but it's the revelation of the
[1:11:09] person and his
[1:11:11] works in the
[1:11:17] church praise God are you together with
[1:11:20] me so in the New Testament
[1:11:24] God reveals himself by
[1:11:27] manifestation and that's why the
[1:11:30] scripture says John bear the
[1:11:35] testimony yet
[1:11:37] we amen of the person of Christ and his
[1:11:43] work praise God let us go there a little
[1:11:47] bit into the Book of
[1:11:49] Revelation chapter one are you together
[1:11:53] my friends
[1:11:55] yes sir so the Book of
[1:11:58] Revelation chapter
[1:12:00] one see what the holy spirit says here
[1:12:04] and verse one the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ which God gave unto
[1:12:13] joh to show unto his
[1:12:17] servants things that must be which must
[1:12:21] shortly come to pass
[1:12:24] and
[1:12:26] John by a
[1:12:29] record amen a record like he's lifting
[1:12:34] something to the
[1:12:38] people amen he bear a record of this
[1:12:47] testimony
[1:12:49] John
[1:12:51] John the seven churches
[1:12:57] that the
[1:12:58] testimony is
[1:13:02] life he was not sing
[1:13:06] Doctrine it was more than
[1:13:11] that are you together with me the first
[1:13:16] thing that God wanted to
[1:13:19] reveal was to reveal himself to the
[1:13:22] people
[1:13:26] and he say hey I am
[1:13:31] Alpha and
[1:13:34] Omega but if that is revealed to
[1:13:39] you by
[1:13:41] Revelation he will always have the
[1:13:48] preeminence God reveals
[1:13:50] himself for the purpose of gain
[1:13:55] preeminence and when God revealed
[1:13:58] himself to the Church of
[1:14:01] Rome and they denied him
[1:14:05] preeminence God gave them up to a
[1:14:08] reprobate
[1:14:11] mind you may still be bearing certain
[1:14:20] weaknesses but don't dismiss
[1:14:24] Christ out of your
[1:14:27] life be like
[1:14:30] David Psalms
[1:14:32] 51 restore unto me the joy of your
[1:14:38] salvation amen the First Church of
[1:14:43] Rome when he was revealed to
[1:14:47] them they
[1:14:49] rejected him to have the
[1:14:52] preeminence
[1:14:56] the first
[1:15:00] F must the second
[1:15:05] FL if it's not
[1:15:08] so then he gives you
[1:15:11] up to reprobate
[1:15:19] mind so Romans
[1:15:22] 1:21
[1:15:24] I'm trying to get out of
[1:15:27] here I agreed with my
[1:15:30] wife that I will not be preaching for so
[1:15:34] long she's worried I'm dying very
[1:15:42] fast Romans
[1:15:45] 1:21 because that when they knew
[1:15:50] God they glorified him not as
[1:15:58] God the first
[1:16:02] four god making himself known to the
[1:16:07] people and that should take you to the
[1:16:10] second
[1:16:13] floor that Lord I Thank you you've
[1:16:17] revealed yourself to me you have helped
[1:16:20] me Lord to repent
[1:16:24] my now have the
[1:16:33] preeminence but the
[1:16:35] Romans the First Church of
[1:16:38] Rome they denied him
[1:16:42] preeminence and then he gave them
[1:16:48] up because they glorified him not as
[1:16:52] God he must have preeminence in our
[1:16:57] lives there are certain things that are
[1:16:59] not
[1:17:03] negotiable like when there's an assembly
[1:17:06] of the
[1:17:08] Saints you don't negotiate
[1:17:12] that you say no I'll see you after
[1:17:20] church sometimes
[1:17:24] we don't glorify him as
[1:17:29] God we don't give him his
[1:17:33] position neither are we thankful
[1:17:38] sometimes that God has chosen You by
[1:17:44] Grace you gave him
[1:17:46] nothing but Grace picked you
[1:17:52] up
[1:17:54] Paul says they were never
[1:17:57] thankful therefore they became vain in
[1:18:01] their
[1:18:04] imaginations and you find a brother like
[1:18:06] what happened to
[1:18:09] him he is vain in his
[1:18:13] imagination and the Foolish Heart Is
[1:18:20] darkened if God can't
[1:18:25] he walks away as the light of your
[1:18:29] life and darkness strikes your
[1:18:38] mind together with me
[1:18:41] here okay let's go to Romans
[1:18:44] 16 verse
[1:18:46] 25 and find out where we can put this
[1:18:51] down
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:55] amen now him that is
[1:18:59] power to establish
[1:19:02] you according to my
[1:19:05] gospel and the preaching of Jesus
[1:19:10] Christ which is
[1:19:13] based on the revelation of the
[1:19:17] mystery which was kept secr since the
[1:19:20] world
[1:19:21] began
[1:19:23] hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:19:25] foundation of the
[1:19:28] Gospel that God would reveal
[1:19:32] himself and then he will have
[1:19:39] prein that's the foundation of the
[1:19:45] Gospel According to the revelation of
[1:19:47] the
[1:19:49] mystery which was kept sacred since the
[1:19:52] world began
[1:19:56] now is made
[1:19:59] manifest and by the scriptures of the
[1:20:03] prophets according to the Commandment of
[1:20:06] the Everlasting
[1:20:08] God made known to All
[1:20:11] Nations for The Obedience of
[1:20:16] Faith so that God could have
[1:20:20] prein so the
[1:20:23] the mystery
[1:20:25] secret is revealed to
[1:20:30] us for The Obedience of
[1:20:33] faith will you always obey the
[1:20:36] word amen and the
[1:20:40] purpose is to have the
[1:20:42] preeminence in his body of
[1:20:45] Believers that is his bride that he
[1:20:49] might live in a
[1:20:51] people
[1:20:53] so the Revelation
[1:20:56] comes with
[1:20:59] manifestations of divine Authority and
[1:21:04] control are you together with me that
[1:21:07] may have
[1:21:09] prein that he may live among his
[1:21:14] people that's why at the end of
[1:21:17] it is going to be Revelation
[1:21:21] 21 new world and the new
[1:21:25] Heavens God in his own
[1:21:34] Tabernacle
[1:21:36] now let me just show you something
[1:21:42] here when the disciples were coming back
[1:21:45] from their mission
[1:21:49] joury Jesus asked them a question
[1:21:54] whom do men said that I the son of
[1:21:59] man they all reported what they had on
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:05] field some say that you are join the
[1:22:10] Baptist some
[1:22:12] elas and others Jeremiah and others one
[1:22:18] of the
[1:22:19] prophets then he asked them another
[1:22:21] question
[1:22:24] say that I
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:28] am are you together with me in Matthew
[1:22:34] 1616
[1:22:36] Simon answered and
[1:22:39] say thou art the
[1:22:43] Christ the son of the living Christ the
[1:22:47] Living
[1:22:49] God
[1:22:51] meaning that th at the fullness of the
[1:22:58] godhead settled in a human
[1:23:04] body because the
[1:23:07] son is the holy spirit in a
[1:23:13] body that's what son
[1:23:16] means son doesn't mean Mary's
[1:23:21] Boy
[1:23:25] because how can I become a Son of
[1:23:30] God I become a
[1:23:32] son by a
[1:23:35] baptism of of that great
[1:23:40] spirit so when Peter says Thou Art the
[1:23:48] Christ means that you are the f
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:55] of the goded
[1:23:58] Bly verse
[1:24:00] 17 listen and Jesus answered and said
[1:24:04] unto
[1:24:06] him
[1:24:08] blessed th
[1:24:13] Simon for flesh and
[1:24:16] blood has not revealed it unto
[1:24:20] thee but my father
[1:24:23] which is in heaven
[1:24:26] flesh and blood cannot reveal
[1:24:30] it listen friends I can teach it but I
[1:24:35] can't reveal
[1:24:38] it it's only the holy
[1:24:41] ghost that can reveal
[1:24:44] it you may come to
[1:24:47] church to hear me that's very wonderful
[1:24:52] but
[1:24:52] I can never reveal
[1:24:57] it Jesus spoke many
[1:25:00] things and the people
[1:25:02] heard and then they always asked
[1:25:07] questions the disciples would take him
[1:25:11] aside what do you mean about the seed in
[1:25:15] a good
[1:25:17] ground sometimes we come to church and
[1:25:21] we hear
[1:25:24] but we should always ask God to reveal
[1:25:30] it we should always ask
[1:25:33] God to open up the first
[1:25:38] fold to
[1:25:40] understand that godhood of
[1:25:44] Jesus by
[1:25:48] Revelation and the moment it comes by
[1:25:51] revelation
[1:25:53] it changes our
[1:25:57] thinking it changes our relationship to
[1:26:00] one
[1:26:03] another it SE us to be
[1:26:08] friendship and it becomes a
[1:26:12] Brotherhood the
[1:26:14] Brotherhood is that
[1:26:17] c and that's the son of
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:25] listen so
[1:26:28] therefore there is no
[1:26:30] school no
[1:26:34] theologians no
[1:26:36] teachings of the
[1:26:38] Bible among any
[1:26:41] school that knows anything about
[1:26:45] it they cannot know nothing about
[1:26:49] it it is impossible for them to to know
[1:26:53] anything about
[1:26:55] it listen now
[1:26:59] God has he the
[1:27:03] senses of knowing it from the very
[1:27:08] elected
[1:27:11] teachers and everything
[1:27:14] else it is a personal
[1:27:18] individual affair with the person
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:26] that Christ is revealed to
[1:27:31] them and if you say it's been revealed
[1:27:33] to
[1:27:35] me and then the life that Christ
[1:27:38] produced here in the
[1:27:42] Bible that same life is in
[1:27:47] him does not produce itself in you
[1:27:52] then you've got the wrong
[1:27:59] Revelation together with me
[1:28:01] here it must be a divine
[1:28:08] revelation let's continue here in verse
[1:28:12] 18 Matthew
[1:28:16] 16 now Peter has received the revelation
[1:28:24] and
[1:28:26] immediately God begins to speak to
[1:28:31] you I want you to understand this church
[1:28:36] are your ears
[1:28:38] open I want somebody to say
[1:28:42] Amen Peter catches the
[1:28:47] Revelation but after
[1:28:50] that Peter
[1:28:53] has different ups and
[1:28:57] downs ups and
[1:28:59] downs now sometimes we may think that
[1:29:04] when God reveals himself to
[1:29:07] you you will never make a
[1:29:10] mistake in your
[1:29:12] life but that's not
[1:29:15] true when he reveals himself to you
[1:29:19] you'll be obedient to the word
[1:29:24] that even when you have committed
[1:29:28] something you have done something
[1:29:31] wrong that voice will
[1:29:34] come and you will say
[1:29:38] Amen you are never tired of the
[1:29:43] altar you just keep saying Lord I
[1:29:47] must father that's not what I want to
[1:29:50] be I want to be a better
[1:29:53] person and I believe that's the desire
[1:29:55] of
[1:29:57] everybody amen so and I say unto
[1:30:02] thee thou Peter Hallelujah I have
[1:30:06] changed your name I have changed your
[1:30:10] character and now you are growing into
[1:30:18] Peter are you together with me you know
[1:30:21] the name
[1:30:23] towards the
[1:30:24] character so God gives him a name here
[1:30:29] and then he begins to grow into
[1:30:31] it he gives
[1:30:34] Abraham a new name and Sarah a new name
[1:30:40] and they begin to grow into
[1:30:41] it Hallelujah will you grow into your
[1:30:44] new
[1:30:45] name yes sir until you manifest the stch
[1:30:50] of a perfect
[1:30:53] amen now th art Peter you may stuggle
[1:30:59] but you've got a
[1:31:00] focus thank God that you've got a focus
[1:31:04] you know what you want to be and God
[1:31:08] will help you to
[1:31:10] that amen and he says Upon This
[1:31:15] Rock of Revelation I build my church and
[1:31:20] the gates of hell
[1:31:22] shall not Prevail against it upon the
[1:31:26] rock of
[1:31:27] revelation of what Christ I build my
[1:31:31] church
[1:31:33] Hallelujah am and the gates of will not
[1:31:39] Prevail
[1:31:41] against praise God yes sir God has
[1:31:47] decided upon the
[1:31:49] Revelation which has kept to you coming
[1:31:53] here which is the revelation of Christ
[1:31:57] is going to build you into a church is
[1:32:02] going to build you into a
[1:32:05] stone that is going to be placed at a
[1:32:08] certain point in this
[1:32:11] Tabernacle Hallelujah you are a part of
[1:32:15] the Messianic
[1:32:19] Kingdom amen so this
[1:32:22] Revelation amen verse 19 it says and not

[1:32:31] than I'll give unto thee the
[1:32:36] Keys of the
[1:32:39] Kingdom and whatsoever thou shal bind on

[1:32:57] Revelation gives you a new
[1:33:00] name and gives you the
[1:33:03] Keys of the
