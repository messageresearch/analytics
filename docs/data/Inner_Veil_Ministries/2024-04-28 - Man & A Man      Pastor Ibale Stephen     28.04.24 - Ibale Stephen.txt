of prayer father we thank you we even and we thank you for the victory you've given your children to be in the house of the Lord under this kind of condition father those are the things that you look upon and you call us Overcomers May the glory of God shine in our MST today as you teach the word in such a special way father in Jesus name amen you may be seated so I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ and uh I certainly appreciate you being here under these conditions amen yeah you see we needed the RS yeah so you cannot blame God for his timetable but we can only give thanks for your Victory amen amen so um we have something here which is going to take about 15 minutes um I've got h a video that I want you to watch and uh before I get into the teaching of the word I would rather you watch that video I wonder whether it's ready Amen brother Henry is it ready so just keenly watch because it's going to teach us something that will be memorable in our lives I think we put off the lights maybe so that we can have good view this was a big church which ended up being abandoned remains of the aan Baptist Temple a vast expans of building that was one of the first mega churches in the United States [Music] it's in America America you the paring AR Bap its modest Beginnings in 1935 with just 80 members it was headed by Dallas F Billington a southern evangelist who had moved to akan to work at good gear Tire in just 6 months the church had grown over 500 members and they built their first building in [Music] 1937 they continue to grow necessitating speakers placed outside for those who could not fit into the pews and by 1948 membership was at 10,000 and a new 2800 SE Auditorium was they GRE to 10,000 in 1948 [Music] the main church is right over but this is now how the church looks like the building is deserted there's nobody oh wow yeah there she is the last for for getet that thing they had radio programs they used to record all the messages they used to preach in that church but look at what it looks like now they had they would use these were like higher yeah these were higher quality than a VCR like you would record TV masters and this thing this is from 93 yeah that is 193 aan Baptist Temple would be at the Forefront of new Ministries over the years even before their first building they had been producing radio programs which would culminate in owning their own record label that put out numerous gospel records Services would be Broad weekly on W akr TV here's some more recordings oh yeah look at this theyve got all their still sa here here's cassettes from they just walked out and left everything there that's dton so this was 20 Soul sermons preached here [Applause] yeah but look at all of these this just has to be yeah from 90 91 that's how much they recorded all those are full of them too well actually a lot of been taken out in 1938 they would bu pioner the concept of bus Ministries when they purchased two school buses to pick up children for Sunday school there were the number would expand buses that take up the city on take their children too by 1969 they were the largest Sunday School in the world with almost 6,000 students in 1959 they had the largest Sunday School in the world of 6,000 children look at this they had it jungle theme with a palm trees as the um support beams it's really random they just had thater it doesn't really look like AER just a tree stop there's too much you know they had all kinds of holes in their they had U Baptist trees they they had everything and even very big ground to park their cars but look at what is happening there there's no evidence of life after death the 24hour VIS was held for over 18 in7 and as the scripture would say twice pled up by the roots Temple was replaced 4,000 SE building even though sometimes attendants would reach 7,000 just two years after opening the new church would catch fire by suspected arson it was rebuilt to the current 4,000 seat Auditorium which sits on 29 acres of land so you know uh those who would need I'll post it on the chat room of the church I I think we can stop it there it has given you the idea of what we want to project this morning do you love him this morning it was once upon a time a famous Church all over the world but there's nobody and government is just wanting to find some money to destroy the building nobody is concerned about it isn't that would you think such a thing would happen if there's no life then that's what you need you can have because the Next Generation they did not have passion the young people did not have interest in the church and that's where the church ended millions of dollars imparted in there but they just waited for the first men who had the burden to die and they all walked out and left it just what can I call it we just pray that the Lord may be gracious amen so um before we can get into the service uh Sister Mary ofy has taken her mother to sambia hospital for another operation so she's requesting for our prayers amen amen and U I want you to know that brother Isaac was taken back to hospital again and so we need really to prepare for the end time I'm now not talking about the end time of the world but our end of time is always not a very simple one we just pray that the Lord gives us Grace amen and I've always desired that if the Lord has to take me out of this body he doesn't need to ask me even if he wants to do it now I'll be happy that way amen so I've got uh also a testimony here and a prayer request this is our sister Anna OK uh for those who don't know are you sister Anna you can stand up that's our nurse there God bless you amen she says I greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I would like to appreciate God so much for the gift of Life Care protection and daily Provisions than God for blessing me with a very nice house in the [Applause] [Music] village how many were able to get there to the function of AD daughter's marriage how many of you just your hand up you know when I got there was surprised is this her house and she also says I surely don't know where the money came from but God has done it for me and I request the pastor to dedicate it to the hands of The Giver May the glory and honor and praise go back to God I can't explain myself out what I know is we serve a God who leave us God bless you Sister OK Anna sister Anna sometimes we don't know how to pray you you need a house but you are praying for money but sister Anna says I just don't know but the Lord did it let's stand up

goodness Lord God you know that we need shelters and we know father that there is nobody who can give the desires of our hearts except you and you alone our sister father she knows that you are the one who gave her her house today she desires to take that house and give it back into the hands of the Builder you said unless the Lord builds a house the builders build in and unless the Lord keeps a city even those who watch watch in but father dear lord god sister Anna knows that father you are the giver and she also now brings it to you May the be the keeper father I pray heavenly father that

a song here before we get into the scripture reading do you love him this morning amen our God is [Music] good bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] today I went back to the place where I used to be to today I saw the sing Old crowd I knew before when they asked me what happened I tried to tell them than to count I don't come anymore than to calary I am not the man that I used to be thanks to calary things are different than before [Music] as the tears run down my face I try to tell them oh thanks to calary I don't come here [Music] anymore today I went back to the house where we used to live and my little boy red and behind the [Music] door but I said Son don't be afraid you have a brand new Daddy oh thanks to Calvary we don't live here [Music] anymore than to calary I am not the man that I used to be than to calary things are different than before Oh as the tears ran down my face I try to tell them oh than to Calvary we don't live here [Music] anymore thanks to C I am not the man that I used to be thanks to calary things are different than before [Music] while the tears run down my face I try to tell [Music] them thanks to calary I don't come here [Music] anymore thanks to Calvary I don't come here anymore [Music] amen amen are you thank through to Calvary you don't go to places you used to go to before amen so let's stand up and get to our scripture reading we shall turn to the book of Genesis chapter 5 and then go to Genesis chapter 2 amen so in Genesis 5 and verse one he says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God met he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created what was the name of Eve at the time of creation she was Adam amen how many of you sisters here a new name the name of your husband those who are not ashamed of their husband their God for that amen this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man my my my he created him in the likeness of God and this man here was male and [Music] female and they had their name Adam and then when we go to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 24 therefore this is now at the separation the female from the male and therefore the scripture says therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cl to his wife and there shall be one body again now I want you to see that Genesis chapter 1 God created the man amen are you together with me he created man he created a man but now here a man shall leave his father and mother so my subject today is man and a man no man and a man man and a man now man here was male and female together but when God separated the female he's now referring to Adam as a man shall leave his father and mother so we want speak about man and a man may the Lord add blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so we want to start the subject today by establishing some fine details between man and a man now brother has done this before he does some fine details so that we can be able to properly understand some of these things he made a fine definition between Jesus and Christ Jesus being the body of sacrifice where Christ the holy spirit dwelt in now he also told us about the three offices of the one God you know he had three offices and yet one God so he says one of the offices his father another office his son and another office is only God so he tells us these are not three people but one man moving in three different offices and then he comes also and gives us the three sons offices and then he says when he came in the body of Flesh he was son of man amen and then through the seven churches he Son of God when he comes in the M he will be son of David so all these fine details every one of them had some kind of clarity to gave to the body so these fine details make important distinctions to give a a statement a better clarity now Genesis 5 gives us the meaning of man okay so God created man in the likeness of God male and female created he there he talking about man and then he says blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created so now listen some of these statements now Man was created but kan's seed was a product of car Union are you together with me man was created the Bible says God created man but then see was never created it's a product of Union amen so man had a Celestial representation amen he was a spirit body that was dressed into the flesh that was a creation and then for me amen but for he is not represented in eternity he just comes as a product of a union of a man I mean a male and a female now listen was a serpent sea that did not have eternal life a wild [Applause] sea that was planted in a good ground You Know The Enemy Satan he just knew the principles that as long as the seed goes into the ground it will germinate and that's what he did he went and got the farm which we know as e and planted his seed there and the seed came to life but have eternal life so can do all things can do are you together with me they can function everything they can learn the language of men they can reproduce in men are you together with me but I want tell you that se is not an eternal SE it can do anything religious it can sacrifice it can even come to church service but it cannot retain itself in the world okay now here the definition of man is the elected human R hallelujah hallelujah th now man man is the elected human race man was defined as the likeness and the image of God which Kan was not does that bother you I start bringing it more deeper into the word because when man was being defined the scripture says God created man and then defined man as the image and likeness of God but Cain was not the image and likeness of God and he was not a creation of God he was just a product of a union so man came into the original existence as a a spirit be and he maintained the general description of man when he was made a body of Flesh he was still man he still had the image of God he was still flesh and I mean he was still male and female but in Genesis 2 when the female was EXT extracted from the rib of Adam we find a distinction when now is refer to as a man totally distinct from the female are you together with me now now man and a man somebody say Amen yes sir let's go to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 when I was out there preaching I told the people that when you say men I Health amen amen Genesis 2:21 listen and the Lord God caus the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh in thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from Man Woman and brought the man so the female [Applause] was extracted and Adam said this is now B of my B and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man now we've got a man and also a woman and so verse 24 is where we read therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall CLE unto his wife and the mathematics will be defied because they two shall still be one are you together with me okay so when we talk about man amen we are referring to the elected human race much as science uses the word man to mean the human r including the serpent se but when God uses the word man is referring to you and me who have got their representation created in the image and likess of God are you together with me the interpretation of Eve does not come through here because when she go birth to uh this man came she said I gotten a man from the Lord and brother Bram says of course it's God who gives life so he gave her life I mean gave Kan life to live by in the line of humanity but he didn't have a representation in heav so man as a reference to the creation that God you know he had the image and likeness of God that is man as defined in Genesis 5 verse 1 and two he was created two he had the likeness and the image of God did have the image and likeness of God is just a result of human you know uh uh human uh reproduction he you know He Man was created in a specific image which is the image of God and the image of God is the spirit John 4:24 God is a spirit amen and this man who has made in the image of [Applause] God he also both the likeness of God Amen and like of God is something to do with the disposition amen disposition is character so he was a spirit image and he also had the character of God that's the likeness there was something in man that would cause him to act like a God and that's the likeness so let us look at brother Bram here connecting likeness and character in message Mother's Day Mother's Day amen he says then I think of when we see them standing y our loved ones our mothers our kindreds all our friends to see them in the immortal bodies they are celestial bodies amen watching their character seeing how they conduct themselves with that sweet and quietness no more nervousness or frustrations to see them standing in the likeness of the Lord Jesus that will be a wonderful day Hallelujah hallu he's talking about mothers who have prayed for their children to make it to Glory and brother Bram says when we see them standing out there that should challenge every mother who is out here in the service to start praying for your children it doesn't matter how crooked they are keep claiming them for the Lord hallelujah and one day amen when the children who overcome will stand out there and see their mothers come they receive the kind of character that they passed over to them oh Hallelujah hallelu watching their character in their celestial bodies praise God are you together with me this likeness has something to do with the character but the image is self-explanatory the spirit being let me say now the Ser SE was not created in the image of God I'm trying to put a value on you which you sometimes do not realize that you may look at a man his flesh and blood like you he has got more money than you have he has got a great name in the nation but you are greater before God because you are a creation but it's just a kind of [Applause] formation a biological product are you together with me that's who you are amen you are what more than 100 W oh praise God if we can realize who we are amen so I I want to take you back into Genesis chapter 1 here Genesis 1 verse 27 we see that God created Man In His Image amen and his likess Genesis 1:27 so God created man in his own image so in the image of God created he him male and female created he them that's man he came through under the image of God so now we've been given the image but now the blessing was the likeness are you together with me yes sir the image was a spirit being but the blessing amen was the life behind that image so God blessed them and he said to them be fruitful and multiply and replace the and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air everything that move upon the so when he created man he made sure that he imparted him with a likeness which is the character and this character here was a blessing Hallelujah he blessed them with what Peter call the divine nature amen so this man here he has the character to be fruitful this is the divine nature which is the spirit spiritual blessings this here not any other man can have this character man are you together with me you cannot go into a certain big convention so that this can be imparted upon you these days they talk about impartation impartation you cannot impart this because this is a nature you see Man was created to be fruitful now fruitful in such a way but he Bears the fruit of the spirit and because he prospers in the spirit even what he touches naturally he doesn't labor the Lord will just multiply just being fruitful that's how to multiply they replenish and they bring everything which stands before them to challenge them they bring it under the fruit of the church that's to sub and then have Domin Hallelujah when Paul is teaching adoption he pointing man back to that nature the nature where man fell from I told here one time that when God created man he gave him the authority to subdue and all the animals subjected themselves to him but when the fall came that nature continued a little bit but after the floods of Noah another Covenant comes and he says that the animals will be afraid of you that's why you see a man who is not born again who does not have a birth back into that nature when he marries a wife she will be afraid of him but if he back in that nature when he marries a wife she subject to him those are spiritual principles so Paul when he teaches adoption is actually talking about restoring us back into the nature and character where we F from Ephesians 1 verse three he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us [Music] not will bless us but has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when did he bless you he blessed you in Christ Jesus mean chist before he became Jesus so this blessing here is part of your genetic nature it's not anything that is forming now he already bless you with all spiritual blessing that's who you are believest thou this amen then you step into your promise amen because that's who you are so the Genesis blessings and those spiritual blessings in Heavenly places when you still an attribute amen you are not even come down into your body nature so these blessings are Divine potentials they cannot be achieved by a car man because this blessings here is favor before God sometimes we reduce the blessings of God to financial abilities and then you said that's a blessed man but those are not spiritual blessings spiritual blessings they are for Above This caral possessions and the Lord Jesus told us the life of a man does not consist of the amount of worldly Goods he has these blessings cannot be prayed into a man's [Applause] life because they are in nature which comes on the Sur when is De with it is inside there like the seeds were in the earth just waiting for the light to strike and the waters to clear then the seeds that were in the ground would come forth so now you are here because you have heard the word you are a you know uh you are a deep which God called go the deep and your genetic see the deep but it was in the M of sin but God had the ability to call and you have the ability to hear so when you hear be like that Lily that will grow out of the m and fights itself until it comes to the top to display the beauty where did the beauty come from it was already in the seed and that's who you are amen am according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so what did he choose you to be that you should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated D the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will having ordained that we should be restored back into the nature and character that is adoption it's a spiritual character that will be finally CT by the adoption to with the change of your body that will be the C of that image and likeness there will come a body change do you love him you are growing towards that and sometimes God is so gracious that he gives you marvelous Revelations of what you are supposed to be here and there your hearts flush one of these days I'll be gone have you ever come to that yeah he keeps telling you yes you are going to get out of here sometimes you have had your dreams when you are getting out of here some of you have even flown up in the air in your dreams have you had those dreams before you see that you are going away and then when you come back into this one here the devil starts telling you where are you going but God tells you I'm working on you I'm cleaning you I'm perfecting you by the teaching of the word the word and let the word begin to come forth like the L of the valley and not long from now can to [Music] display that's why Paul I mean John says beloved now are we the sons of God not we will be now are we the sons of God and does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him we shall see as it not be a feeling of a presence rather shall put on his own body we come from God we go back to God so the I mean the serpent SE is not part of the description of man as described in Genesis 5 that's why the prophet says a man without the Holy Ghost is like a beast because that's where it comes from but the seed of God is ordained to receive the Holy Ghost it's a different nature see does not have the image and likeness of God the image of God is a Divine is a Divine amen the image it cannot produce that image it cannot because it doesn't have that [Applause] representation and it cannot produce the character those two things and now when we got first John chter 3 ver 10 he says in this the children of God manifest in this in what and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother oh hallelujah hallelujah a child of God cannot struggle in his mind about his brother he may be a little heart and by Nature he can cry the deep and the Deep the soul cannot get I mean cannot hate amen that's why the scripture says you don't allow your anger to go over the sun about your brother the nature will get a little bit shocked but as that gets assimilated on this side it fails to get into the soul and then you start saying but is my brother after and then you say God bless you how are you today and if that man is spiritual he'll be very happy with you amen righteousness you know he says whosoever does not righteousness is not of God and that does not love his brother is not of God so righteous is obedience to the word and exercising Divine love one for another is the character of God Amen and the sonship is marked by those two things the first thing you said I subject to the word the second thing do I love my brother those two things do I subject to the word they say I was talking about social media and then you know when you know people receive their messages they read and laugh and then they say you have made my day but when the pastor s Theon in the morning the pastor may not know that I have read let me say Amen you see we should fall in love with the word that righteousness and that's the only way you can come out of the mud and begin Fring out as a child of God praise God do you love those admonitions yeah they create and they mold our meditations amen so he says in verse 11 this is the message we had from the beginning that we should love one another we should not we could but we should love one another by this will the world know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another when it comes to verse 12 he says in those two characters [Applause] Kan is not able to produce it not as Kan who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother simple he could not love his brother it didn't come from [Applause] God and where why did he slay him because his Works were evil and his brothers [Applause] could not return obedience amen and neither the character of the word could work in him because this character of the word those Divine blessings in Genesis you can't pray them that's is a character it's a likeness which was only given to man praise the Lord that's the trait of Lucifer who rebelled from divine order and he tried to plant the same trait in man in the garden ofen amen when Adam and subject their human Spirit to see the trait was to keep away from the word and from the presence started eating on ad and Eve are you together with me amen they cannot be righteous the word neither can they laugh so now what this happened he so his object he sold his se he sold his practice he sold them his C he open up that and they almost sing to [Applause] their we thank God for the Aton in the amen listen now Genesis 3:8 and they Adam and Eve heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the of the day Adam and his wife he themselves from the presence of the Lord among the Trees of the garden Hallelujah huj there was a tree and then the trees my God we have got a church and then the churches they tried to hide among the trees they say I also be a part of that church but God says I have got my Tabernacle here where are you why are you hiding in the tree come under the tree of and the Lord God called Adam and said unto him where thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and you remember when you were dealing with nakedness is the absence of that Glory man sined and came short of the glory of God theia is naked because it's void of that Glory you see what I'm talking about so now Adam is saying how can I come before the world in this kind of condition which I am I am void of your glory I have seen that trait had access to the human Spirit of Adam and Eve but we thank God for the blood atonment in the garden because the blood went straight to guard the issues of life which is the soul are you together with me that's where the blood went to guard the soul so that the soul that sin shall die that did not go to the soul of Adam it was in the spirit area and God gave the blood to stand between the soul and the spirit my God so the tra was eliminated from entering into the soul and under the law of Moses the atonement was repeated every year to keep God of the human soul because the blood makes atonement for the soul are you under the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood hallelujah hallelujah I know it was the blood hallelujah hallelujah praise God for the life of the flesh is in the blood lus 17 the life of the blood is in the blood and I have given it unto you upon the altar what have I given you the life of the blood has been given to you on the Altar for the atonement for your soul my God my God you love him amen the blood that make atonement for the soul praise God Amen God came down straight and he came down with an atonement because Adam confessed that I have sinned I am hidden away I'm among all these kind of trees here some of the people we had here they take refuge in the trees at least I go to this kind of church this kind of church he says no come under the tree of life he says no no no no I cannot come I don't have the glory amen so they cannot do two things righteousness and love that's how the world is that's first John 313 says Mar not my brethren if the world you Mar not when your neighbor hurt you Mar not when your workes hurt you they cannot return a nature which they don't have love is of God okay Brotherhood has a bond of Charity which works automatically through us as a nature because were created in the image and likeness can I tell you something here that's why brother Bram says elect cannot protitute [Applause] elect no elect cannot fight against elect so today I am going to talk about the Bible description of a [Applause] man whom the scripture for days that he will leave father and mother to be joined with his wies and there will be one body where are the men here today man and a man so where is man because man was both male and female where is man now let man stand up you stand up come on now that's good that is man it was male and female okay so let a man stand up where is a man good I can see some there where is the man man stand with the pride of being a man thank you God bless you God Made You distinct from the woman the masine and feminine Spirits are not the same if you find a man blushing around like he was a woman there is a problem body structures are not the same the rules in our lives are not the same the man is a b spirit while a woman is a tender female [Applause] spirit and by even scripture Our dressing cannot be the same so when God made a man he made sure that he really place a difference both in design and character as opposed to the woman amen so let us just look at the separation here in the separation God allowed the male to display the character of God and the female to display the character of the to be a weaker V are you together with me God allowed this to bring to surface the man's Redemptive [Applause] nature you together with me did it a woman can never be the same with Inner Strength like a man he made a weaker vessel he made Sarah a weaker vessel he made the bride the weaker so that you can always be forgiven are you together with me that's God you see we really need to give thanks to Abraham the father of Faith look at this female Revelation that maybe that's the one whom God told you to get the child back so take this my Bond woman here and got a child out of sounds like it was in the garden is it and Abram did exactly the same and the child was born and then the next thing God says no this is the one going to come by Sarah the greatest fighter against that seed which was isma was was Sarah the child of the born woman cannot beave with my child now Abraham says no I canot put and God stands with Abraham let me tell you Abraham crying s the woman are together with me he wouldn't have liked to do that he would have reason Sarah you not play with my mind who told me to go with her now what wrong have I done SAR you not play with me but God makes a weak Vel so that you may play the part of a redeemer you are not saying amen me to preach that you are the weaker vessel and cry in the house no it's not you to cry she's the one to cry sometimes you go to the depth and you really seual but you have to be a redeem together with me you see he makes we God did that to just dig up your Redemptive attributes because you are the image of Christ in the house the husband must always play the part of a redeemer and this is what the parents should be able to I mean to cultivate in the male children make them men tell them that their B spirit is not intended to bully their young sisters but rather to protect them teach them you see the church that we're looking at here they lacked males to pass on the seed and the men who had the Revelation when they died the young people did have anything to do with the church did you hear that amen so your B spirit is not intended to bully her is intended to protect her to n her to redeem her brother Bram says he made the B spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman so your B spirit is supposed to be the defense you are the redemer you have to R you have to stand for her you have to stand between judgments that's what God gave you B spirit for man and a man praise the Lord so a true male is the Redeemer man is not judged by how big he is and how strong his muscles are man is judged by the character and character Lord that's why when God created Adam he doesn't tell us whether he was 6ot or he was one M wide by the chest he only tells us the character that he gave him that is what makes a man amen and Christ was not judged by physical strength he was judged by character when Isaiah looked into the spirit world and they saw Christ his description of Christ could not reflect what the kind of image today's preacher would want to portray of Christ now when Isaiah looked into the eternity and he saw the coming forth of that prophecy he says unto us a son is born and when he looked at him clearly in Isaiah 53 he started to describe the son in verse two for he shall grow up before him as a tender and the root out of a dry ground he has no form C and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire des and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with G and he do it weigh our faces from him except by Revelation hallelujah hallelujah everybody he Des except by Revelation because his character and in his nature amen was not what the men wanted to see amen they could have wanted to see great big giants but when is says that he grows up like a tender man who comes before them there was no might no glory no power in the human flesh what makes a man young girls who are here today is not the strength of that body height of that man the money it is the quality of spell which is described in Genesis 127 genis are you together with me yes sir Christ was defined by character brother Bram said I have seen men that weigh 200 pound and and and didn't have an ounce of a man is measured but you are a man in the house and you are making your wife cry every [Music] day I know the sister she could cry over good things and could cry over bad things when she was sick she would cry when you sympathize with her she would cry woman praise the Lord PA said I knew of a 14 years ago either in the body I don't know whether in the spirit don't know praise the Lord God bless you so a true husband must display the Redemptive character because God allowed the relationship of husband and the Rel chur so a man was first referred to as a man in the separation in Genesis 2 verse am man leave his father and so what made a man was the separation and at this separation there were certain responsibilities that a man was supposed to play the things that went with him in the separation That's What Makes a Man we've seen what makes man created the image the likeness but then in the separation the man took certain part and woman took another part so if you don't play the part of a man then you are not a man I Thank God I'm a man is am let us see the Maj qualities that man you know when the fall came man fell from two qualities let's go to Genesis chapter 2 verse 5 and try to understand that and every plant of the Feld before it was in the Earth every of the field before it grew for the Lord God not caused it rain upon the Earth and there was not man to te the ground are you together with me they have not put on the body yet either but God is looking forward for a [Applause] man to the ground there was not a man to te the ground so a man was formed in the body to occupy his inheritance the Earth and also to work it amen that was the purpose of a man to come upon the Earth and tender the Earth he must have a desire to work and feed his family are you together with me that's a man so even in the fall the responsibility to feed his family still laid on him because the scripture say in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till Thou shalt return out the ground for out of it was thou taken and for death thou art and out un dust Thou shalt return did you hear that that was the thing that was committed to man after the fall lost two things the first thing he lost he lost eternal life in four he lost the glory of God he came short into physical contact with and when anybody else was born after byor we lost physical contact with our are you together with me amen and the next thing he lost was his inheritance two things and brother Bram in the brid message says he lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember that day you eat there you die he says he lost his inheritance what was the inheritance the Earth that's the reason why you don't want to die because this is your inheritance the Earth you scramble you go to doctor you sell all your property because you want to remain here Heaven is not our home that's just going to be a resting place where we go just wait for the cleansing of the earth and then we come back here that's why you don't want to die because God made you to be here I know sister doesn't want to die nobody wants you may be here and suffer you might be a poor man but there is something that binds you here this is your home we lost it to see then brother Bram says and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life two things because he had complet Supreme C of the earth he was a god of the earth God is the god of the universe amen but his son had this Earth under his control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything but when he did that what did he do he lost his inhance So Adam could not change the order of the Chim in heaven but he could change the layout of [Applause] the has seen you for a long time now go to the mountain and then UPS Mountain come here are you together with he had the power of nature that's why you find out that in the battle Joshua could stop the sun because it was something natural are you together with me that's why brother Bram could stop the storms because that's something natural but we cannot change the order of the we cannot change the order of theab so in creation man was given responsibility over the Earth to feed his family she the wife relies on him in feeding and [Music] maintaining understanding of God when we get a church with husbands who are students of the world we cannot get a desolate Church like that there will always be the power to replenish hallelujah hallelujah after this pastor is godone another man Even a greater revelation to the gift when this Deacon is gone there will come another one the anointing to replenish must the church the anointing to multiply must be in the [Applause] church praise God she relies on him he must be a hard worker and he must be a good student he gave Eve her perers listen and she jumped those perimeters to test Adam's Redemptive nature if knew she would not go into those territories without his presence because he had the glory that would keep way evil but he walked out and went into the trees to tast the Redemptive powers and I know you know when Adam heard the SC he ran and went out there and the woman became a merchant as they said the other day and she so the idea and wonder I leave her there I will lose her I must go over there to get her back here Adam does not say how many times will I tell you Adam just says no I am her Redeemer going to get her back Satan give her back and he took her back are you together with me you don't have to start saying I told you last I told I'm saying this because I'm a pastor I have heard that many times sister I told you you are calling her sister but the way you are acting is not brotherly a man will not only provide bread and butter but he will be constant Redeemer seven times seven times a day the same the same num of times the Lord would redeem you back every day and I know that a real wife will not like to be stubborn so that she can to be redeemed a real sister won't do that this is the balance we can go forward amen amen I like to have a church with real that's the only way we can replenish and keep maintaining the life of the holy spirit in the church when men let's go to Isaiah chapter he replenishes the life right from his family do you love him okay Isaiah 38 verse1 he says in those days was eah sick death and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos came unto him and he said thus says the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt not leave you will die had heah done anything wrong no but the living di so prepare your family because you are not going to be here forever that is a man every day he's preparing for his departure hallelujah hallelujah when he earns some money he's going to buy some land there because he knows he's not going to live here forever he will try to build a house because he knows he will die he will not leave he preparing for his departure amen are you here amen you prepare praise God now the Bible has introduced us to this man who had the quality of spirit and his name was eah he began as a young God-fearing man different from the Rich Young [Applause] Ruler because had detached life he had that experience with God he ped after David the king amen because when we go back into the Gen of Christ we say that and gave birth to David they don't stop there they said David the king and then David gave birth to Solomon Solomon was the king but they don't meaning that David was the patter of Kings that's why when Jesus is coming back he comes back as a son of David because David was the perfect [Music] K are you together with so now he ped after David because he was a king and he says I don't want to be like a soul I don't want to be like a soul I want to look at the pattern and the pattern in area here is King David oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't want to be anything else in the age where we are we have about the son of man Ministry I don't want to P of the great [Applause] preachers that I have heard about men who are pre wonderful things the ministry of the son of going to the messages going to the books where I want to Hallelujah Hallelujah that was Hezekiah ped after David and the Lord prospered him in his ministry as a king he broke the high places he broke the present serpent amen put people into the present to test truth so that the people would be able to hear God the prophets and his priests he trusted God and held fir on the word the Bible says he also prospered amen but then even the might die and hezekiah's time to die come and God did not want him to lose his family just like it doesn't want you to lose your family he inspired the pastor to preach in a certain way that you may become responsible he doesn't want you to lose his wife because you are supposed to be the bridegroom that actually takes care of a bride that's why he makes a pastor PR in a certain way go home and you tell her sister I love you you are born of my B of My Flesh you are my glory prise god yes sir the African man to say I love you you mean is that new to you I love you so you want me to tell you you tell her I you again and you make sure you smile and when he says I love you get closer to him give him a very good heart and then you tell him I'm subject to you a man I'm dealing with a man and heah was a man and God loved that man served me very well he but I will not let you die without putting your family in order that's a man whom God loves he doesn't want him to lose his the promise is Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house but heah where is your family I'm talking toah today where is your family when God deals with a man you this man to take this experience and share it with his family to pray with them to study with them and also to bring them into the Assembly of the righteous to make them part of the when he makes his money in the mon he budgets for his family to church are you together with me yes sir that's a man heah made a mistake amen because he came to church alone he worshiped alone he studed the word alone and God saidah where is your family put it into because you are not going to leave to and yet through the edges each time God opened the door for a man was always wide enough that his family would defe him when he gave adam the atonement it also covered is and when Noah built the Earth it had enough room for his [Applause] house when the Passover L was given it was given for the war house when Abraham was told to take the token of the [Applause] circumcision it was for the entire house we should never leave our families outside of the promise even RAB who was a woman did not leave his family out L not did not leave her family are a man God has made you the head of the family A man man and a man let's go to a man means a lot he's a carry of the seed he should be careful when he given to carry the seed he must plant it in good ground pray for your children apply the token on them Deuteronomy 16:16 three times in a year all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose he saying all males in the Feast of un bread in the Feast of Wis in the Feast of Tabernacles and they shall not appear before the Lord empty are you together with me that's a man he knows how to work don't come to my house I have my granddaughter Rema when she talks about something she sings a song out of it I don't now she's able to do that she can talk about her mother and then she can say I don't know but she does it that's a man the scriptures they never fail do you love him yeah so he said three times the Mals the carriers of the seed shall appear before me three times in a year and specifically calls out the Feast the Feast of the UN bre the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles it says they shall appear if we had time we would have broken down those feasts so God cared about the male children because they are carriers of the seat man and a man so in Tye the male retained the image and the female always tapped into that image the males they rain the image of Christ that the female May tap into that and even in the applying of the token the men were circumcised and the women were circumcised in the men come on now when we have strong men we have a strong [Music] church when we have men who are weak they just have a habit of coming to church then we don't have a future of the church God is not talking about the women he says the males shall appear before the emphasis that been placed on the men and he says in verse 17 every man shall give us his able according to the blessing of the Lord which has given thee you know I don't like preaching money but if I don't you always be poor because the only way you can give you can get is if you can give if you retain you don't get nothing but we saw that cast your bread upon the waters and after many days you get it back are are you here with me and I told you whatever you give comes back to you but you cast nothing on the water and you are standing waiting what are you going to get give your ti he says men not women but the carriers of the sea so we can create a heaven on Earth for our children if we include them in the promise we study with them we pray with them we instruct them we include them in the token a lord God my children let them hear you when you are praying for them you see when the people get into the land they become so complacent you know forgetting their families Hezekiah you are not going to live forever take care of your family I know you've done so many great things and I appreciate you and you are my son where are your children you always pray but you pray alone you always go to church but you forget your children apply the token to them bring them into the promise before it's too late and I want you to know that you already have the atmosphere around you to do that because when God spoke to I mean to to Hezekiah heah still had access to God just R immediately and ran towards the wall and he says Heavenly Father I've lived a perfect life sinned against the and God said yes and then yes and then yes and then he says father forgive me give me more time for my children and then when the prophet was going God told the prophet my child now has learned his responsibility and tell him that I am giving him more time for the sake of his children men are you asking for more time do you have Revelation that God has given a seed of life to reproduce life you want to see this church living there must be living men you wonder all the property was left in that church they walked away from the types they walked away from everything they left it the men did have the life man and a man amen still there you need a different environment around your family heah why do you act like a king all the time huh why do you treat yourself like you're the commander of the Armed Forces all the time you are home in home you are a father learn to play with your children learn to talk with them as friends instruct them in the word heah what's wrong with you he enters the house body guards all over the place we just want to be so busy you get home you have your computer I didn't to work you take these children away from you don't have time for you this is your seed give it life look at Abraham he did certain things and the children also benefited from it are you together with me when he paid ties the Bible says Li pay ties when he went down as a great commander and he fought those many kings look at Judah they come down here and they discomfort all those kingdoms did you hear what I'm saying You must have something to pass over to your children at least some of my good friends are not married yet they know how to act when they marry don't and he's laughing are you together with me sisters you need to marry a man because that's what if was given a man and Mar to a man and this man has been described in the Bible Hezekiah be a man shall we go back home and open up those family altars shall be like Solomon he takes back his children and then he starts saying my son when the Lord speaks to you my son my son and then he built the entire Book of Proverbs talking to his son God be gracious so we have to repair our homes am to fit in the image of a listen list I said last week that these TVs have become so small that they now fit in our pockets you can watch anything Real Madrid with who has one who has one it's already there and now they tell you a repl of the match and then the man is there the child is coming Daddy leave me so you are these are your children raise them up I had a brother who used to visit him and he could come all the
