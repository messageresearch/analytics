already answered the prayer that was led by Brother Joshua that was led by Brother Joshua we couldn't believe it some doctors went to check on her with some medicines which they said was not to heal her but relieve pain reaching there they said we don't see any sight of cancer in this old woman and yet all the medal forms were they attend their medicine much as I had advised her to tell them that

brought to my attention that we have sister moazi here sister Ruth you are welcome sister Ruth sister Ruth you can stand up she starts with trouble but let her try amen she got some kind of stroke and the husband brotheri just went to be with the Lord the other day sister Ruth you are welcome Among Us and may God bless amen so then we go back to the script scriptures we start uh we just refresh ourselves a little bit just as you seated eel 9 verse 1 he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying them that Char over the city to draw even with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which Li toward the North and every man slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was closed with with the writer ink horn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the present o there were six men with destroying weapons but among them they were joined by a seventh man who was closed with Lin and with writers inkor by his son and the glory of the god of Israel was G up from the Cherub you know when the Ark of the Covenant uh was uh covered by the M because the masit was the top that covered this I mean Ark of the Covenant and now on this covering here we had two cherubims one on this side one on that side and they had their hands up like that and under them there was the throne amen the Lord Throne was in between the that's why the scripture says God will dwell was among the chab amen but then verse three here the glory of the god of Israel was gone from the Cherub whereon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers in on by and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sign that cry for all the Abomination that's committed in the midst the Lord that blessing the reading of his word so for a title this morning we are going to say the ink Port man amen the ink and before we take time on this particular man of the in we need to understand the pardon the pardon which was done for us by Christ on C you remember brother Bram telling us a story about this young man who was in the Army and then because he was scared he ran away from the front line but then he was arrested when they arrested him he was taken to jail and had to be sentenced and the Judgment was death when convicted but you know this man here you know uh uh he he had a situation that we are going to look at this man here uh you know he he was pardoned by the president of the nation and when he was pardoned you know the uh the pardon was written on a paper piece of paper and signed by a president and the Way It Was Written was not the normal way because it was a crisis there was going to be a death by firing and the president was fire away from his office he could not have a presidential se but yet he had the authority at the same time so he wrote the pardon and when he wrote the pardon this young man here amen they took the paper to him so that he could uh uh present this when the hman comes amen the boy looked at it he understood the procedures amen of how a paron can be written by a president and the young man looked at it he trusted and he said don't Mo me because I'm going to die he threw away the PD I want tell you here friends but the soldier boy rejected the pardon but a pardon can only be taken when you ask for it and received as and when it is given we are called to accept the pardon because the scripture says come unto me oh you and a Heavenly and I give you rest so a Christian basally is called to evocation is called for a way of life evocation is a calling and the way of life that should actually influence a man so evocation [Music] evocation this vocation is a calling you are called into a vocation he's the one who speaks that language so I can't help you so you are called into a way of life amen that's Matthew 11 and verse 29 he says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am me and L in heart and he shall find rest in your soul amen listen here friends the Yoke amen he says when you take it my yoke is me my yoke is L my yoke is light you find rest amen so he's trying to tell a man come unto me because I see you are liing and I will give you rest amen and once we get into the rest we become like him he says I am me I am l in heart and you shall find rest take my vocation and learn of me I am your amen and it starts with me breaking your heart of I [Applause] am broken and contrite in heart for my yoke is easy and my burden is light my Y is calling to a life of submission to the leadership of the Holy Ghost as a Christian in this walk we become prisoners to the freedom that Jesus has bought for us are you together with me becoming a prisoner to the freedom that Jesus has bought for us oh praise the Lord yes sir it is very wonderful it's very precious and we really thank God who has bought this freedom for us today I want you to say I am free amen and in this Freedom you are a prisoner into that freedom can you imagine being a free prisoner amen because Jesus bought that freedom for you and the chains you have and the chains of Freedom you bound to any man you are not bound to any religion you not bound to any system you not bound to a nature of sin because you being called to a freedom amen I want you to take this here now that we need to understand the pardon that Christ has won for us in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and verse three says when he had by himself pugged our sins he sat down on the right hand of the majest on high and now this is contrary to the annual Feast of atonement amen which was done every and the blood would expire every year and so they have to go back again for but this atonement which was done by Christ was done once and for all Christ entered into the holy of holies on and after that he sat down hallelujah hallelujah amen why does he sit down he's not coming back into atonment again he has done it once for all and he has entered into rest oh praise the Lord and you Happ this morning he had secured the Redemption for us and today the finished work he sat down knowing that we were also going to enter into the holy of Hol Paul teaches that he was accepted for us amen he was accepted in the holy of holies on our behalf how does he do it he takes the sin what kept us out from the holy of Hol the same which had kept us away from the holy of Hol and takes it upon himself and then gives us his own righteousness isn't that wonderful so by the blood we've got access into the holy of holies oh praise the Lord listen to Hebrews 2:4 that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that's the devil through that death the devil was impaired against you amen he was impaired amen and by constant holding C before us we cannot forget that our sins were pged away you cannot seee looking at calary at Calvary Jesus hanged out there and every sin of the world that was ever committed and that was ever going to be committed was upon him at the at amen and then there was Mary Mary the mother of the body he was right there watching us all the SC all the evil all the wickedness was flowing toward sin he was like a magnet to sin amen and all the sin came to him the difference between him and Adam is that when Adam took the sin of his wife he had no ability to read himself of that se that's why people are sinners this morning because the nature of man could not read of se but thank God for C hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus Took the seed he died Hallelujah went into the grave in the grave he he went again into the into hell and he walked into there the door opened on its own is the master in heaven as is the master in Hell praise the Lord and when he entered out there in the kingdom of darkness SL entered in there and he say Satan I have brought to you your SE hallelujah hallelujah he gave it back to Satan that's why you are right today because of the work of Calvary praise God Amen The Life of Christ that constantly builds within us reminds us that we are pged that we are washed that we are cleansed that we are perfect hallelujah hallelujah because God backing back with what we lost the moment you accept that father you died for me and I thank you for you going to Calvary on my beh hallelujah hallelujah once you say that then that means you accepted that Christ who has taken your sin not packing I meaning you you know his righteousness his goodness his Mercy his fruitfulness and that's why Peter says in second Peter 1 but he that lath these things amen what things are these these are the things which Christ has packed us with amen after we have been forgiven he begins to pack in you his own life as virtue knowledge Temperance pre godliness impacts those things in you but he that lath this amen is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was ped from his old SE so if you are packed then your box car is [Music] packed ised amen when you are forgiven and you accept that pardon not like the other boy what does God do he begins to pack how many believe in their in their pardon today a paron is a pardon once received as a p amen so now God himself begins to work upon your life to bring you to the state of a perfect and every step you take you thank God for it I have taken this now I will take that also amen it's God himself he's parking you praise God therefore the cross understood in the right perspective is the junction point between the two WS amen between the redeemed and those that reject the Redemption simply because they don't come from the economy of God if you come from the economy of God you accept everything that God has for you you don't look at yourself the way you are you begin looking at yourself the way God look because the die not to make you what you think you are but to make you what he wants you to be amen that's where our success comes from it's not in our strength because let the weak say I am strong that's what we are called to be praise God in this walk we become prisoners to the freedom that Jesus has bought for us let's go to Ephesians 4 and verse one the holy spirit says I therefore the prison of the Lord Beek you that you walk worthy of the vocation where where with you are called with all liness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love that's why he saying my yoke is light my vocation like the calling upon your life is I mean is summed up into one thing humility to the word that's all when he says Be You holy don't look at what you are you just say amen and then you walk in is the one who knows what is going to do to achieve that for you so Christianity glows with humility the way up is always down when we lack the Val of humility we can never walk the upward way so with this background we can go into the subject of the inkhorn man but even still to understand that which begins with Ephesian Ezekiel 9 we still want to drop back in eel 8 and see why God would allow amen six men destroying weapons to descend upon his people amen because in Ezekiel 8 Ezekiel was seated in a house and the Elders of Judah amen were sitting before him and immediately the hand of God touched him and anointed him to ascend into prophetic amen he saw a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his lines even upward I downward and from his lines even upward as the appearance of the brightness as the color of amber amen so the go then God takes him by the lock of his head [Music] amen he was taken by the horn amen and he was hanging Between Heaven and Earth and while in this anointing the Holy Spirit brought before him the northern gate amen oh praise the Lord which we have read about in our text in eel 9 verse 1 to4 so let's go to eel 85 build a backround for something interesting that God wants to do in your life because this morning I believe that among us there is and his commission is to uh uh anoint is to seal amen those who s for the sin that's committed in their amen if you for the sin committed in your city today God is sending an praise the Lord eel 85 then said unto me son of man lift up th eyes now the way toward the North so I lifted up my eyes that were toward the north behold northward at the Gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry you know it's called the image of jealousy amen so the spirit lead seem to see the image of jealousy at the northern gate of the temple okay anything any Idol that a man holds amen it causes God to jealousy because God says You must not have another God beside me can not worship another God beside me but then just outside of the temple the northern gate there was an image of jealousy we shall understand this image of jealousy represents or shows the Indulgence of the people amen as they just walked out of the temp in the northern Gat what was there image amen which means that the Life of Christ was not being lived when the people were outside the church there was a fall among the people in the church there was a worship there praise God Hallelujah but outside there the people were not standing the way they standing chur but still God being long suffering kept himself among the people ADV could have them back are you together with me yeah he was still in the temple that maybe when when they come to the temple and they hear from the priest something will be said that will change them but as they walk out that image of jealousy was there what makes God jealous in your life you have the answer so Ezekiel 84 and behold the glory of God of Israel was in there amen according to the vision that I saw in the plane so God is long suffering all the time he goes with you all the way until you cross the line amen I want to tell you something here about the longsuffering of God God is long suffering because in the fall of Israel when they rejected Joseph he went with them into Egypt in his long suffering God was right there and one day he says I have heard your cry I have seen your labors God went with them when they rejected the ministry of Jeremiah he went with them to babyon in his long suffering and he sent prophets among them like Daniel and eel so in this Vision God speaks to Ezekiel to look aside and when he looked aside he saw a war which the Lord told him Dr that wall so that you can see the leadership of the Temple [Applause] that Temple so he then saw they he saw when he drilled that Temple he saw how they washed the image of Jealousy on the other side he also sees the women were crying to tamuz which was a strange God so he started seeing strange things inside inside and outside of the temple where all kinds of heathens with men in the house and their hearts were turned against the altar worshiping the sun they were worshiping the son are you together with me God was revealing the hearts of the people in the city the people that came to the temple the people that came to worship and so then when you go into eel that's why he says get six men with destroying weapons because this thing here is not what I desire to see amen that was the condition that led the Anor man a condition amen like that in the days of the judges after Samson when everybody was doing what seemed to be right in their own and looking at the end time is the same condition which the church is in people have turned their back to the altar like they did in that time people have turned their backs to the Cross they have forgotten that their sins were P they are not allowing God to work clean and pack we are living in the times of the rejection of the pardon again because the scripture says in these last days he stands at the door and he knocks behold I stand at the If any man hear my voice I open the door I come into him and with him and he with me oh hallelujah hallelujah but has rejected the is like that is like the days of ezel in chapter n that's why the holy goost Tes the same scripture of the ink man when brother is going to preach the token message he picks the same scripture of the import man because the condition is the same the people in church but outside church we have not walked like we are in church the people have turned their backs to the Cross they don't care about the tear that Christ cried for them they don't care when he says he's finished they don't care whether he rose or he didn't R so they just live their life the way they want to so eel there is a I mean is prophetic of the age of the rejection which is the edge of L where he says behold I stand at the door I want to say God is knocking at every door this behold I stand at the door God is standing at every door this morning so now let's go and analyze eel 9 here he cried also in my ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand because they had rejected the message of the hour they had rejected the message of Ezekiel and any form of rejection to the world results into judgment brother Wilson was preaching mercy and then judgment amen and doing what seems right in our own judgment is an Abomination because God has put the word before us you cannot say this also can work like I were looking at last time because if says this also can what and when she got Cain she said I got an A man from the Lord God does not work with Alternatives God works by the perfect way amen so we need to keep our eyes on the word this is causing God to come against his own people to the extent of disting his own Holy Temple amen simply because the people have not listened to the prophet people have not listened to Ezekiel people have not listened to Malachi people have got their own decisions in life amen so in verse three says and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which Li toward the North and every man slaugh a weapon in his and one man among them was closed with l with the rightous inkor by his [Music] side and they went in understood by the [Music] present amen so Disobedience the voice of the word invites judgment and we see men coming forth with Slaughter weapons to judge the Disobedience of the people but among them there was one man that did not have a judgment weon hallelujah hallelujah we thank God for one man who had the fin L he did not carry a Slaughter weapon this man just so this therefore makes seven men and this seventh one was a unique man holding an and they all stood by the present alt so when the Judgment of sin is hitting the ungodly I want you to listen to this when the Judgment of sin is hitting the ungodly they will always be the seventh man to see what side you take if they are judging sin they will always be the seventh man watching if you are going to jump out of the he has an that can seal away from the oncoming storms of judg and the scripture say they all Stood Beside the present alar praise God and the present altar represents sin which has already been judged and condemned and that's why there was somebody that stood by amen they were in the church but not in the world did you hear what I said he allowed the men with the slaughter weapons to enter into the church this man Ezekiel was standing between Heaven and the Earth he was in a vision he was seeing things and he was seeing that while the people come to church they are under condemnation they are under the sword of judgment and yet at the same time God puts a soft voice very small still voice just one man among the six the seventh man still Small Voice will you come unto me that I give you rest amen will you come unto me that I may deal with your mental health because many people have got problems with their mental health amen you remember I preached that sometime people under depression they just hate everything they just hate everything they hate the good they hit the back they under tment will you come unto me that I may take interest will you come unto me that I may take you out of depression so many people are not happy but there is a man here who can change the course of everyone's life amen praise the Lord Brother Bram says BR speaks of judgment as is seen in the present altar where the pen for sin was met in the sacrifice upon the altar amen so at this time the glory of the Lord was moving from the chab the SE to the threshold are you together with me as the men came in then Ezekiel Saw the vision that now death is taking over from Life the glory of the Lord is walking away from the Master Seat and it was going into the door that's how the church was there was no glory of God anymore but the people were always there oh Heavenly Father we thank you for Your Grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for this we thank you for that but while the presence walked out the grace of God stayed behind Hallelujah the man with theor stood behind Amen to give Grace to those who realize that they need more God in the entire in this time where lsia has rejected God there still is hallelujah who can give Grace to those who are thinking different who are acting different they don't dress like a l they don't go they got Aire deep down in their heart they why God help me I don't want to be what I am there is something in them that cries against the sin that is committed in their City amen they say for the sin committed in their City they've done things that are not good from the pop to the people there must be a cry in the city amen is the cry in the city for the sins that committed in the city that always brings in The inkor Man by your side amen you see the threshold is a doorway so as the glory was moving to the threshold it means that the day of Mercy was running out amen rejected the grace of redemption so Ezekiel 9 is just like the day of lysia where we are living no wonder the Holy Spirit took the same scripture gave it to the prophet and preached the token by the same scripture so where are we living now we are living in the days of Ezekiel amen so let's go to verse three there and the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub whereon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man closed with L which had the right by so we need to know that brother Bram uses these scriptures when appealing to us in the Quest for the token amen so this is a scripture that would have I mean that worked for I mean for the time of eel just like it is working in our day when brother Bram is preaching the talk it's a compound scripture like Matthew 2:15 which says out of Egypt have I called myself son amen and in this scripture it is fulfilled in a a double way God calling Israel out of Egypt nation and God bringing back to Christ from Egypt back to Israel after the death of King Herod so we can also test that the spirit of God is headed out from the church into the bridge are you together with me he's coming out of the church into the bridge between the seven churches and the seals he has walked out he's saying come up here he's trying to separate us because L is under judgment the way they think is under judgment we should not think like Lord this year Lord this your to do its own righteous we should think like a God because God has given us his own righteousness amen joh the opening amen of the understanding of redemption in Revelation 5 he was told Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to lose the seals and open the book but when John where was the judge there was no judge because the judge become Theon hallelujah hallelujah so why would you look for a judge why do you look at judgment why do you judge yourself you see the situation as it is the church is in a mess but while it is in a mess we thank God he has opened the door of the bridge and he has even come forth Among Us with Anor what is he looking for he's looking for a man who will for the sin that's committed in the city amen so we can also testify that the spirit of God has headed out into the bridge a space of time between the church ages and the rolling out in Revelation of the Seven Seals so in Ezekiel 1 which we have dealt with sometimes here the work of the Holy Spirit was represented by four living [Music] creatures and scripture inel 1 verse 19 it says and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up hallelujah hallelujah the four living creatures was the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and so they kind of come up in form of a ring and then the Holy Spirit again formed the church in the same way that now it was a wheel in a wheel the whe of the four living creatures and the whe of the seven churches a wheel in a wheel and they kept moving together they were locked together they were permanent locked Hallelujah hallu but when the living creatures which is the Holy Ghost was lifting up even the wheel on the earth which is the church was lifted up together with friends if this is what God is doing is latter than we think because the threshold is right there and the glory of God is moving out moving out moving out it's the will of God and the desire of God that we cry for the sin committed in the city and we get joined to the wheel that when the glory goes out it doesn't just go anywhere it's the time for the rupture amen that's where it goes so currently the spirit of Christ can put up with abom cannot put up with the Abominations in lodia so he moves from the church into the bridge come out over my people come out of her come out of L now the funny thing is that the church is not realizing what God is doing if you realize what God is doing then we would always weep for any little thing you begin to weep weep for the sin committed in the city the bad feeling you have about a brother cry that it goes away that kind of whatever attitude you have C that it goes away amen you cry for the sin committed in the city because these people were in the church but God just lifted up Ezekiel H in between the Earth and heavens and says look at your people when they walk out of church look at the image of jealousy look at what they get involved God so verse four and the Lord said unto him now this is interesting go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that side and cry for all the Abominations that done in the midst thereof this being a compound scripture the holy ghost is now applying the token upon his people and is calling his bride out of organization into the bridge to be sealed till the of redemption he's calling and friends it's latter than we think there's something that brother Bram said this is the message identification of Christ in all ages he was talking about 1964 when the uh earthquake hit on a good Friday it says the Earth shaking all over with earthquakes why the first time the earthquake ever shook the whole earth was on a good Friday the last time it shook it was another good friend shaking the w what did it shake for because they had rejected their Messiah why did it shake again they've done the same thing are you together with me when Earth was dark and Earth was under Tremor says why they had rejected the Messiah and he says again 1964 on a good Friday why did the earthquake Shake he says they had done the same thing they rejected Christ the person 1964 they rejected Christ in the opening of The Seven SE are you together with me they had rejected him in the opening of the war Christ had stepped forward to open those Seven Seals but how many people took it the glory of the Lord has since started moving out of the you know through the threshold and outside of the threshold behold amen outside of the threshold is now re 4 verse one the calling out of the Bride out of the church into the bridge praise God the church is everything but the bride is the chosen lady the elect lady we're looking at yesterday she has been called out amen called out for what to be given the stat of the perfect man to come into the status of gas amen John looked at him and says I've loved him in truth we are growing into that amen sometimes you will not even know you are growing but you are growing that's what Mark 4 says you can look but you can never see the SE taking one mm I thank God that all of you are amen you are growing and let the weak say I am strong how many are strong this morning I'm one of them amen so and after this I looked for verse one and behold the door was opened in heaven 4 verse one amen and the first voice which I heard was as it where the trumpet talking with me come up here and I show the things which must be herea where are we we in the come up and what is there we are listening to the prophetic voice of Malachi 4 the message of the hour amen you are being called out and you are moving into circuit amen of Psalms 91 Amen in verse one he says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty say the Lord is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust that's why is collecting his children putting them into the bridge putting them before prophetic message pulling them out and putting them in a presence so that he can shine some of them amen it's a seing Time for those who die for the Abomination that committed in it's now time that the inkhorn man would start taking elect through a sealing [Music] process sealing process amen and once you are sealed you are sealed in and then everything is sealed up because brother Bram T us about the box car that's what he called The Box Car you know he puts all the package he wants in there faith and virtue and knowledge Temperance the very Life of Christ and the Fruit of the Spirit he looks in there and then seales it you may not even know that it's there until the challenge comes Hallelujah that's when you know oh my box was seal amen everything that I need for the journey God has already put it on the inside you only know it's there when you come into the time of challenge there is a special Grace that comes down here and that Grace is God himself he picks out a v you need at a certain time and you bear the fruit you may not know that you are a very kind man until challenge comes then you'll discover oh when I saw the brother I couldn't stand it and the people know you are mean but the challenge is what produces that life praise the Lord amen so the moment we the moment we are justified by faith at the foot of the pyramid praise the Lord so he declares us justify we receive what Paul calls the spirit of adoption meaning that we receive a Divine Life that helps us to grow into our personal adoption so God seed must come through the hands of the tutor before that adoption to lead us through our Christian experiences to lead us through our trials to help us di our are you together with me amen why don't you thank God Amen while the destroying angels are here there is a man with in just at your side Hallelujah you happy with that because he knows you are fighting you s you sigh because many people said do you think I have the Holy Ghost me you do you say you cry is not your joy to live in [Music] sin you cry and the reason why you cry is because you have got the spirit of adoption that spirit will lead you all the way to your adoption he's not going to leave you in the wilderness he cross with you the Red Sea he go through the experiences of the Wilderness he cross with you the Jordan until you come to your position in Christ amen yes sir so let's look at this in Romans chapter 8 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear when you were Bound in sin you were scared you fear hell you fear judgment everything but the spirit of adoption comes and picks you up in the condition of sin and unrighteousness when you s and you say father upon me at the stage of justification he picks you up and walks with you you think he doesn't nowh he wants to take you he wants to take you to the state of the perfect he walks with you as the word is being preached you are being cleansed you are being washed don't reject the word don't be negative to the word because that's your cleaning when comes to you it's Awakening you to a of need amen he's only pointing at this and then you begin to say heavenly father Heavenly Father you cry for it the token comes over and he says okay I'll take you another level we are going to make it friends is one step at a time and I've always told you that a normal person walks on one leg that's what it is you don't walk on two feet you can't make it you walk one foot at a time you take one step at a time that's a normal man if God takes you into a stage thank him for that stage and when he has done that it means it's going to take you another stage one by one we shall walk until we shall come to the stat of a perfect man is that eval promised to you is that ev's promise to you no it's the Father's Promise if it was my promise it would fail but that's his promise for you that you are going to make the state of a perfect [Music] man amen praise the Lord for you have not received the spirit of bondage to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption which CH AB father father when we come down here you see people lift up their hearts everybody's AB father father AB father he I have a problem AB father God listens to those prayers even if they are coming from the weak spirit amen that's the spirit of adoption he drops him to help us in the stage of justification because we could not in any way justify ourselves it's the Holy Spirit from the beginning so the spirit of adoption then helps us to catch the Revelation that we are sons of God and he's our father and that our sunship is not outside here on the co but it's the Gen seed of God on the oh Hallelujah the genene SE friends I said the gene the gene of God on the side when Christ came into the flesh Jesus grew in sture wisdom and then also in favor with men and when he comes into my soul Jesus begins to grow hallelujah hallelujah my growth is not me my growth is Christ in me it begins to grow brother Bram calls it light as small as a Buton but it begins to grow cring out all the darkness praise the Lord amen so the Revelation breaks forth that you are a gene of his Gene and that when he became Flesh and Blood he was coming to redeem us from the Trib of SE amen we know who we are and we shall judge ourselves by The Obedience of the seed gen on the inside amen the inner man has no pleasure in a life of sin he SI on you s you see you get home you are not happy you said something here you did something there you are down on your knees and you are saying ABA father AB father that's the Holy Spirit to you on your own you can't do that sin can't cry against sin amen that's why we receive the spirit of adoption to ins the character of humility to Father amen your Works cannot do it it must be the work of the Holy Spirit you amen listen to what the prophet says here same spirit that saved the Los s that Sanctified the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is now seting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus so many people have told us that you have to be justified and then Sanctified and then be baptized by the Holy Ghost yes they are words of the Prophet but what do they mean because we got a people who think they justify themselves then sanctify themselves and afterwards then they go to receive the Holy Ghost that's impossible he said the same holy spirit that saved the Lutheran is a work of the holy spirit in justification it's a work of the holy spirit in your sanctification the work of the Holy Spirit when he comes to occupy his house these three processes is God building his house by justification sanctification then coming to fill his house there can't be any other way praise the Lord the same Holy Ghost then put you into your sanctification by the teaching of the word amen in this teaching you are getting rid of certain things of your life ready for the Holy Ghost come and dwell on their side amen through your sanctification you are growing you are growing and you are growing at the end of it all he says yeah my house is clean when he comes one time he just and he says now I'll lock in the S hallelujah hallelujah you remember the man who drew the heart of Christ I mean who drew the heart of a man because you know he was trying to vict Christ would enter into a man's heart he drew the heart and he put the door there and in the work of art you need to be criticized you look here and there you see your work is done you let somebody come and look at it so the people came they said the problem with this there's no Larch on the door how would you open this door and said the man on the inside is the one who opens hallelujah hallelujah the man on the inside is the one who opens you are the one who opens and the moment you open Christ would come the door is locked and the moment he comes here he becomes the boss you cannot go to the door again you you can't open for another you open once and he sits at the throne hallelujah hallelujah he's the leader of your life he the boss on the side he has sealed every false seed out atud on all the other problems they are on the perimeters of the human Spirit but for that we've been given the blood so every morning you go and S you go and S it doesn't take out the man on the side but you are cleaning the perimeters to keep the house clean because the master is on the inside praise God Amen it is the sealing angel that takes you through the process he's your tutor coming forth in various formations along the Christian journey in Romans chapter 3 verse 26 he's the justifier then again he that sanctify is the Same Spirit as one that sanctifies he takes the word to expose every weakness of your human spirit and like now when the word is being preached it is exposing your human weakness you don't get hurt with that you get happy because God is pointing at every negative area and at that point you begin to s you say that's what the ink the inkp man is here for and immediately we begin to s for the sins committed in the city amen we get so desperate amen and then God begins to take us through phases of life brother Bram says I'm finishing soon when the seing angel crossed through the country he was commanded to put a mark upon all those upon those who s and cried for the Abomination committed in the city I say this with reverence now and with respect don't get mad at me but what if the seing angel crossed this nation where would he find men so deeply consecrated to God the sins of this crumbling Nation till they cried day in and day out from the SE where would he Mark the church that fast and prayer and long Lord Jesus where would he find that person Let It Be Me amen many were crying men who are crying for the consecration of their cities you look at your city there is a DOT here you cry you look at your city there's a DOT here you cry they cry for the sins committed in their City they take best inventory to see where they fail looking back into the history whether they've got besetting sins which keep coming up so that they can cry AB father w't you come and take a was of me W you come and become my gu want you come and become my guide my comforter want you come and become the fruit of my life you are trying to step away all the time that you and Christ may become one amen the prophet says you apply the blood and kick all the trash out of the house and have house cleaning time you women take off those shorts you men throw away them cigarettes and you women too get all this old stuff out of the system here that's called the world if you love the world all the things of the world is because the love of God is not even in you when you are ready to apply the token empty up amen and get ready for it you can't serve God and M at the same time together with me amen praise the Lord you cry and you s you cry and you s let's colians a little bit chapter one verse 12 give me about 5 10 minutes and we shall be gone giving thanks unto the father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light you think you unw worthy you are worthy just give thanks to the father who has made you to be partaker of your inheritance in the Saints we are called into an inheritance like Abraham was called into inheritance and just like Israel was called in inheritance amen verse 13 He has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in Christ we have Redemption through the blood even the Forgiveness of sins so we are redeemed into from into are you together with me we are redeemed from into but then you've got a human Spirit which keeps the history the problem with you is going into your human Spirit then you remember the cigarettes then you remember the night Killers then you remember the Witchcraft I think maybe I'm not even saved the problem of your human Spirit that's where you dwell dwell in the word let the word tell you who you are don't tell yourself who you are you are going to fail but hang on what he said about you he says you have been called to an inheritance amen we are redeemed from into from the kingdom of darkness into Kingdom of Light redeemed from the wicked traditions of heathens to the kingdom of his dear son the kingdom is the m i mean the kingdom here is the Messianic Kingdom and in it we have got a blood Redemption I mean and the Forgiveness of sins did you read the scriptures very well verse 13 has delivered us from the power of darkness and translated it into the kingdom of his dear son in that Kingdom we have Redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins this is what we have in the Kingdom now that the blood is inside there let the devil not keep telling you you will not make it you have failed no you've come into a kingdom where there is enough blood to wash your failures to wash your mistakes because God knew that during this life here you are going to be tempted and tri I'll put a basin of the blood in my kingdom will you birath today today amen praise God Amen we want to see people who really know who they are and where they headed to it is a kingdom that's not joined but you are born into it and our citizenship is in [Music] in we already have our Redemption but as we so on we may hit a problem here and there but we are been reminded about the presence of the blood of Jesus Christ and this afternoon we can put all our sin under that blood if there is any feeling of sin if there is any feeling of failure I tell you now you can begin to Ser you can begin to ser and yes I put you under the blood smoking I put you under the blood fication I put you under the blood witcraft I put you under the blood I put you under the blood that's when you are sing and you are calling father he will energize you amen John says if you confess our sins if he I mean is faithful and just forgive our sins amen praise the Lord let's finish up on this scripture here that's in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 18 we've got the ink man he just wants to know whether you sigh for the mistakes that come in your life that's what he wants to know Amen brother yes sir Hebrews 10:18 now where remission of this is there's no more offering for for Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus you don't go before him because you are perfect you go because of the blood amen and he says you have to have the bodies you have to have a determination you must be able to take a step you must be able to confess so that the door to the seat of Refuge open for you amen I want to tell you that as you say as you say the six men with weapons of Destruction cannot touch they can't touch the man is here he's taking guard of you he knows you are not clean yet but you have a desire and you are s you are crying you are growing day after day you have a thousand sins you have brought only 40 to death but he know you are doing the right thing you are he always stand by you he will stand by your side and you put a mark nobody should touch this one he's going to protect you as you keep saying AB father even this one I
