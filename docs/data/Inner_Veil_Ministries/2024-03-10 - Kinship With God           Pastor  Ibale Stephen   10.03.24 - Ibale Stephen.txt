I'm here so it's a blessing to be here in the house of the Lord amen so I've got uh a few prayer requests to bring forth um remembering our brother Isaac who is in the condition that is in that the Lord may be gracious and extend his Healing Hand amen and also to pray for Sister Mary she's terminally ill but we pray that the Lord may be gracious to her and I've been told she has been taken back to hospital again again so it will be nice if we can do the best we can to go and check on her amen and I've got another prayer request here he says dear brothers in the family of God please pray for my only daughter elizabethe 51 years old she is very weak and sick because of fighting six years against the defeated enemy called cancer she's now in a very very severe [Applause] condition her husband stepan stepan is nursing her day at night in a very devoted way and he said thank you so much brother God Ro from Germany he has only one child and now he's in that condition let us stand and take those requests To God In Prayer precious Heavenly Father we are in these pest houses Lord the bodies of time they are not Eternal until after the change of these bodies in this bodies Lord we got a lot of [Music] pain brother Isaac in that condition Sister Mary sister Elizabeth but before them stands the promise that by your stripes they were healed father I pray that you may stretch your hand towards them because they are healing is Father they are bread from the father and Lord they are healing also is Father the earnest of their Resurrection I pray Lord that you may extend your hand rebuke the spirit of death and Restore Life back to their heing bodies father we always trust that whatsoever we pray in the name of Jesus that we receive that our joy may be full we committed those Saints into your hands in Jesus name amen so while we are standing I think let's go to scripture reading and you are all welcome to the house of God Amen that's important for us to feed on the word of God Amen without that there's no future amen because the future you know is dropping into eternity so eternity picks us from this side to hand over into the fullness of Eternity amen so the book of Romans 12 and verse 4 amen we are going to read here it says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of another let's pray precious Heavenly Father we thank you for these scriptures a lot is hidden under them but I pray father that you may give Grace very special Grace father that you may Feed Us from what you have hidden under those scriptures by the power of the Holy Spirit bring quickening power father to every elected seed here they may Rejoice father dear Lord God in the newness of life we are committing to you the needs of every person here father I pray that you may just go back and forth touching every one of them in Jesus name amen you may be seated so it's a blessing to be in the house of the Lord and U honestly I was saying a few things Amen on the platform of the church I felt like I should really start participating amen so that we can keep talking to one another I was saying that the only joy of any minister is the same Joy of lady when she makes the there must be somebody eat it if you want trouble in the house let your wife keep cooking the food and then you just say it's okay good food but I not EA you are going to have a lot of trouble thank you for coming over to listen to me speak that's the reason why I have a call is because of you people the Lord has picked us from very far very very far God told David that I picked you from following ship you know just where the sheep goes that's where David went and then brought him into the Hors a king so the church came from very far there are brothers like brother brother David here that can tell where we came from and I appreciate you all for your faithfulness it's not being fath fa F to me is being faithful to he who called you amen we've got children and children have children and we are multiplying every day so let us just keep that Focus for the sake of the children that God has given to us so today I'm going to speak about kingship with God yeah you see the kingship with God the prophet in several areas of his ministry did everything possible to define the family of God you know we are a family if a brother wakes up in the natural family and walks whenever to return it robs peace from that house you keep wondering what happened to our brother what happened to our sister that's the way God does even we here we are a family in the body of Christ brother Bram used these words and says I'm a Bram by birth and you are a Christian by birth you don't join the family of God you are born in the family of God is that amen yeah we don't join the family we are born into it we are part of everything good in that family and we also part of everything bad in that family if the family is poor you don't deny the family because they are poor we are born in to it we cannot choose to join another family and then you begin rejoicing that I've come to a very rich family we are a part of the family of God by bus so we are in the family by a life it's a life brother Bram says these words now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and as provent to have these virtues in him that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance and patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him or blesses him and there thus when you see the sons of God and Daughters of God we don't see Sons and Daughters of God by those who come to church but with sons and daughters of God whom God has seal his life in them and completely now he sees his life emanated through those people he says God then places them he seals them and he says that's the only we can tell a son and of God so in the family there is a genetic flaw influence amen you see this brother here when you see another brother somewhere else there is something that puts you together amen are you together with me there is a genetic flow when you see the family of Brother David even if you've never seen Joshua and then you've seen Dan there is something that always strikes it's a genetic influence is not something that you are going to put on it's a form of life that's managed by nature and that's literally un Inseparable from the G you don't have to to train how to walk like a family is naturally in on the inside of you are you together with me you cannot say today I want to get in the muto family and I start looking like them I start talking like them I know there are some that have trained like that when they become ministers they want to speak like their pastors but Wilson is not like that brother James is not like that you know all these young people done is not like that amen they are naturally what they are amen it's a genetic attribute a thing that comes from the SE amen and you look like your father and you laugh like your father it's a nature it's a life you are born into it Amen brother Bram says man in the beginning when he was made a man is a god he's absolutely a God for he was made in the image of God being a Son of God and then he is of all that God is amen not ha to what God has but ha to what God is meaning that you develop nature which is literally like a god you put on an image so this inheritance is a nature that can bring forth the supernatural because it's God himself so you just let me allow God himself through me amen you don't put on a fire you don't struggle to love you don't struggle to love you don't struggle to to be paent you don't struggle to be me it the nature it's part of you you don't struggle to forgive because it's a nature and it says that we are here to what God is we are here to Faith we are here tot we are here to knowledge we are here to Pence we are ha to Godliness we are ha to brotherly kindness we become a hair of nature amen thank you if you've got that praise the Lord amen do you love him you see you become a of what God is meaning that a nature of God begin to display itself through you because the all things that you come from God by this inheritance we are talking of is a nature that can bring forth all the works of God just involuntarily amen so brother Bram says that being a Son of God you are a nature of God that's what it means to be a Son of God you are a of God so listen now procreation we are dealing with je amen so when a child is born in a family and they want verify and confirm that this child belongs to the family they deal with jeans are you together with me they deal with Jes so you know being passed on throughout one of spring because that's the law of nature everything reproduces from its own kind so we look for the the the center of [Music] life that's the Gen that's why the prophet saying being a Son of God you are a nature of God you are ha to what God is not what God has because what God has people can extend a hand and touch it even when they are not part of God do you remember what on Fai amen so that's why God says in Genesis 111 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the have yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after [Music] his whose seed is in itself whose gen is in itself upon the Earth and it was so so that's the law of nature fruit after his kind you put an app seed the life on there is the life of an apple you don't get an appc about it you just get an Apple because that's what you put in the ground that's the seed in itself so that's the law of Nature and that's why the natur of K and ab could not be compatible because they originate from totally two different sources amen was of the evil one and then you know Abel was from Adam so they could not have the same gen because they came from they didn't come from the same Source the ground can be the same but it can bring forth every type of seed that you put on it amen and that's why in God making man he said let us make money in our image and our likeness let us allow the SE come through man to represent God here on Earth amen So Adam proceeded from the spiritual Gene of God to this the nature of God here on Earth like you plant being God also planted in Sea in a ground that's called Adam so Adam came here on Earth to display the nature of God your new birth God quickening that se which is on the inside of you that you may display what God is is that amen that's a wonderful thing so I've always told you that the way God works when he was creating this was God now and he says let us make m in our own image in any case is saying let us allow a little off of our and make so this man here is the nature of God Amen the body he was put in it's just that seed being ground planted in a ground so that it can come forth and be able to display the nature of God a certain scripture comes my way now that's in Hebrews chapter 1 the invisible was made visible by planting a seed in the ground amen so the scripture says in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one God who times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets amen it was God in the prophets it was God in David it was God in Samuel it was God in Joseph whatever they did it was God in those people then he says here has in this last days spoken unto us by his son meaning through his son he has appointed he of All Things by whom also he made the [Music] [Applause] world and he is the brightness of his glory the express image of his person now the person of God is spirit and is invisible but when he stepped into Christ Christ became the express image of the invisible God that's why he say I came in my father's name I came under the character of my father I come to displ what my father is are you together with me amen and I want to say God created Adam and placed him in a body of Flesh Adam was here to take care the invisible God Amen praise God and that's why when Adam fell he could be redeemable because the life which was on the side of him was God himself are you together with me that's why Adam could be redeemed because the life on the side was God that life is eternal why don't you ask why are you here you come down here naturally you would have a lot of things to do you would have many friends to Vis you have some businesses to do there is something that P and you come to the house of God why do you believe what you believe you see somehow there are so many natural things that could even make you doubt and that's true but down there there is something that holds the Eternal gen on the inside of you it can never part with you it will bring you into a way to manifest the life of God hallelujah hallelujah amen you are redeemable because on the inside of you there's the SE of God you are redeemable because the life on the inside of you is eternal amen you are not getting to believe so that you may have eternal life that's not what it is you are redeemed because you are Eternal Redemption is bringing it back to the or isn't that wonderful that God is restoring you the enemy tried to wave you this way the storms pull you this way but you are redeemable God keeps bringing you back are you together with me amen that's John 5:24 very to you he that Heth my word and believeth on him that sent me has ever everting life you don't believe to get everlasting life but you believe because you have everlasting life a life on the side of you that always seeks for God Amen it's like a compass amen it's on the side of you and it always locate the north amen it will always locate the no star it will always bring you to Christ in the midst of your troubles even when you in many different things there is something that keeps ping toward the North Star amen praise God we don't believe to receive eternal life we believe because the seed On th side is God himself that is why we have the Fountain of blood Amen to maintain you clean before the amen and this Blood here is for the elect because they have eternal life you know the enemy tries to take them this way but the voice calls you back and the blood is in that voice it keeps bringing you back to maintain you clean because the seed on the inside of you is God himself amen now when Adam took the body of Flesh listen he fell by [Music] sin amen and in this fall there was hybridization through the 16 organic Elements which make our body but the gene of life on the inside could not be reached by the hyd when hybridization happen and there was a strange nature of life that contracted amen the seed on the inside could not be touched I don't know whether you understand what I the seed on the side could not be T you've got something on the side that sin cannot come and totally overpower I don't say that you cannot STG you can that's why we have scripture that he leaves the 99 to go for one you can St but you cannot get lost I'm not talking to everybody now talking to those who are the seed of life from before the foundation of the world there is nothing that can completely separate them from God they will always be a deep calling to the Deep amen there is something in you that the devil cannot reach it is called life it cannot mix with death are you together with me it cannot mix with death because when the devil came and brought sin in the life of Adam the death did not go for the soul the death came by the flesh by which Adam s that's why Adam can not die a second death because he was redeemed that's why you cannot die a second death because you are [Applause] redeemed the effects of sin can affect this flesh you can become sick you can be buffeted by taking you into Hebrews chapter 12 to chastise you but the seed On th side we always be saved you are a child of God born of God and he did not redeem you to lose you he redeemed you to make sure that he brings you back home amen praise the Lord amen last week I was talking about looking at one another by the ey of God Amen so I I just can't understand the grace of God the love of God the goodness of God it surpasses you see sometimes we want to bring God and put him in the bracket of men but God knew the end from the beginning are you together with me that's why he said he can never lose you why do you want to believe you can be lost you cannot that's not why you were redeemed amen the gene of life may be dant for a long spell of time in your life 10 years 30 years 40 years 50 years the seed of life is D but it's right there because it is eternal life amen so it is this side there could be D for a little while but when the light of the word strikes it and the life on the inside of Wicked then you realize you've been Eternal from before the foundation of the world let there be light and then the seeds would come forth let there be light of the word of God when the sein on the inside awakens amen yes therefore we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn amen because we were see is the reason we could be quickened in there's nothing to Quicken are you together with me because you were see there is something that appaled to and you said Lord forgive me Lord a it's only the seed that can realize you need help from God only that can cry for redemp it's only SE that can submit to the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord are you together with me you may say brother Steven what about those who believe and then STG along the way the answer is that the Good Shepherd BL them into Hebrews 12 to perfect their character Hebrews 12 to perfect their character let's go to Hebrews 12 in Hebrews 12 he makes them appreciate the concept of uh Psalms 23 where he says thy Road and thy staff they come from [Music] are you together with me he makes you appreciate that concept that God can get a road God can get a stuff to help the ship I was saying when I was on an interview on Friday saying that how do you handle the people who criticize you I say I ignore them I ignore them because this is a man trying to pull you into a fight why would you fight him the Bible doesn't allow me to fight I just ignore them and then the brother says oh you know some brothers uh take them on in their church because if they don't the people will go I told him it's okay if they go God didn't orain them for me to take them beyond the curtain of you see what I mean so I brought the concept of the L and the Sheep God told Peter feed my lamb feed my lamb feed my sheep but would you know why Jesus the most mature that a Christian can be was never referred to wor he was always called a lamb he never grew beyond the lamb he was always a lamb sheep devops an independent mind it can argue it can fight ship can kick the shepher that's ship and the Sheep doesn't normally recognize some the authority of the shepherd that's why Isaiah says all we like sheep have gone astray he doesn't say we like Lambs all we like sheep sheep devolves an independent mind and when one ship goes all the others will follow they'll just go by the time they get there but why have we come here I don't know but we are here that is ship [Music] in one sheep jumped over a and it died a second one came a third one came 1,500 sheep and the man lost them you see when you see all these churches where people get turo it's not because they are not children of God but they've assumed the level of sheep Jesus never became sheep he always remained a l but God told Peter even for those sheep feed them what do you feed them for so that they can be able to Humble them to the nature of the Lamb are you together with me will you be lamb forever amen God be gracious so in Hebrews 12 that's where we get the concept of Thy word and thy stuff they comfort me and this Comfort here comes in a state of pain because here in Hebrews chapter 12 amen he says in verse three for consider him ended such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest he be worried and faint in your mind you have not resisted yet I mean resisted unto blood striving against him Jesus was perfect but he fought the contradiction of sinners you call yourself a Son of God you are not even 50 years you said before Abraham was I am he resisted the contradiction but you he says you have also to put on some form of [Music] resistance on the other side so that you may not give up because you are being tried to get your nature and character perfect he says in verse 5 you have forgotten the ex exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastisement of the Lord no faint thou when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chth and sces every son whom he receive now in verse 11 he says now no chastisement for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it heals the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby thy Road and thy staff goes for the one ship which is always getting out of the C and this is not because the Lord has the Sheep but whom the Lord love so if he and you are Destiny amen you need to devel patience temp that God may have a thorough work at the end of the day you are going to be benefited by that amen So when you say oh brother we used to have brother so and so here brother so and so here if there were part of that Eternal economy then God himself will go after them and puts them under chastisement he sters them in Babylon for 70 years and then brings them back when they've got a great Zeal they build the Tabernacle again anything that's against the building of the Tabernacle they build me back the house of God again that's the way God works amen there will be a bride because she's an eternal gen much as she's ened in the Natural Body amen God has done all the means to make sure that you make it he'll make sure that you wash your feet amen last Sunday we had foot washing here amen and you know it's a symbol of humility but yet at the same time it is also a symbol that you are willing to walk under the blood I mean the blood together with me amen listen now when the frot washing came says you cannot wash my feet then Jesus says if I don't wash your feet you have no part in me are you together with me you can't be constantly be part of my body because your part the feet your walking must under cleaning amen you walk you get yourself that back and forth you come and wash your feet amen God has put a provision for us that we have to keep our feet clean we've got the SCS [Music] on Amen but the scripture says keep your SCS clean we come down here to get our SCS washed amen there will be a bre because the blood shall never lose its power until the last Ransom the wor Amen to see no more amen praise God yes sir so you know those Hybrid Bodies this body is here so brother Bram knew that his natural Gene the Bram Gene not the seed gen of God he he knew that it was hidden in the same body with the seed gen that Eternal gen of God that's why when he would get here in the platform and he was going to start his service he says now let williiam Bram get are you together with me he knew that some somewhere the spirit the human Spirit that's where the nature of char andam live amen yeah he knew that but he says God have mercy that I may raise a level higher amen to the point where David will go into the house of God and he says praise the Lord all my soul and all that's within me amen he was appealing to the SE G the in the soul that's freen by the Holy Spirit and that's what we are that's why we have the battles of Romans praise the Lord amen so the same body this body here is the devil's and then right there we get the concept of the twins Kan and in the body in the garden we've got two distinct species in the Garden of Eden the wheat seed and tears which is and somehow somewhere those things bother you in teaching the message uh Kingsman Redeemer brother Bram says when Bo came to the time of redeeming R he went to the gate and gave chance and opportunity to the nearest Kinsman which was near Truth than this man looked at what he had and he says this truth here is a very expensive woman if I go to redeem her I'll my inheritance and he says given and then the says that the near is the devil are you together with me he has access to this he's the near kman but he cannot redeem the soul and restore it into the bride status because the price meant death and then back to life the devil couldn't do that are you together with me so c a product without a spiritual gen amen where had the Gen of God and he could hear from God by Revelation they both lived in the same Garden hallelujah hallelujah and when God spoke he says I want a sacrifice both of them but then by the but this man came heard by the ear and he went and brought the fruits of the ground are you together with me in this body here and so brother Bram always said let William Bram step out he has anger he has malice he has Envy he has this he had that how can you be greater than me he has all those kind of things you cannot H those things and be a servant of God at the same time you cannot H those things and to be a child of God at the same time those parts belong to the near K and we need to get out of that there must be perfect love flow out of us from the gene of life amen when the flesh man was hybridized Lucifer got himself hiding Place hiding place in your human Spirit the twin princi and that's why Paul say I find the law that when I would do good evil is present with he wants to do good but the easiest is evil before but regardless of the invion of evil there is an eternal gen on the inside that from God by Perfect fath and what he hears translates Revelation and how you overcome evil one on the outside amen that's what Paul says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God by the word of God Amen so this is God Elohim elim Jehovah God is the word when you get off there by you know God creating you of himself then you become part of the word and then you hear the word the word the G makes you different from the rest of the world are you together with me the seed chin is the part of God that you are and that's the Son of God that God speaks to you know you can go on a political rally you hear everything by your ears but when you sit in church it is different you feel like you are hearing it from a different angle when you hear in the political rally 40 people were killed it is 40 people but when you come down here and we are talking about twins we are talking about jeans you are not in the scientific field the holy spirit will be talking to you from another Channel aren't you happy we have the capacity to hear from God Amen praise the Lord the Gen is a part of God Amen I want you to hear what the prophet says now you see we not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God hallelujah hallelujah so when God made man and hid that seed On th side then it has multiplied it has multiplied and every one of us is a part of God did you hear what I say you are a part of God and we must come together and then the pill of fire is manifested in the Wess in the fullness of it when his church sits together Heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church together with me when you are by yourself at home yes you are a part of God but there is a part that you are missing you are missing the part called me they are missing a part called another brother you are missing a part called the singer everyone is Anointed in a special way and when we come together and we bring our leaks of fire together I tell you brother there is more of God Among Us than when you stay back home alone amen am he says when his church sits together places then the fullness of the power of God in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pill of fire back [Music] again amen that's now an eternal spiritual Fellowship did you hear what I say yes sir we are not talking about this flesh no sir you may not like this man here because of the way looks [Music] like but we don't come here to appreciate our looks we come here to get connected to that gen of are you together with me that's what brings us together one time there was a man called David he was so anointed that when he begins to sing demon flee and so was always depressed he didn't like David he would have desired to kill him but each time he came into the services where David was and was tring his that would flee we don't come together because we love one another in the natural aspect we come together because we are a part of God Amen so now the muline and we who came off of him we are the bride and when the m and The Feminine come together and that's what we call the son of God is the that comes out of that that's what the Son of God so we are the nature of God here amen gathered together amen therefore have more of God and the atmosphere of God here is greater than when you alone and when you have that understanding and you're in the house of God Anything Can Happen yes sir anything can happen you can get healed you can get sealed in the B of the Holy Ghost you can ask for your way one children God can give them to you amen because you were in a special presence amen and from beginning the devil always desired to be part of this kind of atmosphere he knew what that atmosphere when he was in heaven it was an electric atmosphere a glorious atmosphere but when he broke he wanted to be born back into that atmosphere but his nature doesn't CH each time he gets back into that atmosphere his desire he went to the fellow and he was hunting for he would always let me tell you something do you know that you are under seal do you know that the devil cannot reach you unless God allows he cannot reach it he can't you are sealed down in the are you together with me he comes he comes and God asks him Lucifer come fellowship and say maybe you thought about my servant job and that one he loves you [Music] because does not fall sick you keep that command does not fall sick he says you think so I can allow and then you touch it and God allowed and he buffeted the body he could not reach the soul he took all his wealth but he could not reach this I want to say that the devil always deserved this atmosphere and brother Bram say the devil never misses church he can never miss church he's always there in service whom can I Divine whom can I but the seed is in such a secure place that the devil cannot reach bothering you he may bother you but he can never get to who you are amen he always desired to be part of this kind of atmosphere and the prophet says it was impossible for Satan for is not a created spirit being to repr himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so that Genesis tells how he produced his and introduced so injected himself into the human race so he fails behind the same color of skin now because he was finally Bor by a natural and he came into the domain of men and began to Veil behind this King so that he then had access to get your human spirit he could stain the human Spirit to stain it by reasoning like he did even in the garden so ining with his children God deals with the seed Gene that's part of the Eternal Word it's not this that God deals with are you still here this morning amen let me try to see how I can wind up with this amen so now the devil had access to the garden and now ab ab and they in the same garden and today you the garden amen the devil has access to your human Spirit but God has access to yourself the devil has access reason God has access to Faith in the same Garden we cannot tell who you are except when we check your by the word amen let's go to John chapter 8 and verse 42 Jesus said unto them if God were your father he would love me for I proceed forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me your father you would love me so the separating now is the word test you would love me meaning that if you came from God will always call to the Deep amen he came by John 3:16 because he loved you and those that his will be maged to that love I love God back and then love one another are you together with me if you were of God you would love me because I didn't come on my own God sent me John 3:16 and those that are his will be magnetized to that L that's the C of love now amen from the father to the children and to one another my God God loved me and I love him back by his love and the sign is if we love one another just turn around and tell a brother or a sister I love you it's not you but the seed on he says why do you not understand my speech even because he cannot hear my word if you are part of that Eternal Word why can't you respond to the father's voice he's asking them and verse 44 he classifies them he are of your father why and the L of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and not in the truth not that he never knew the truth but he AB not in the truth that's a very great sign of being a child of God the wind will blow but election brings you back amen you say I will never go nowhere it's only the devil that does not abide in the truth because there's no truth in him and Truth is a person you remember amen when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he a liar and the father of it oh hallelujah hallelujah the church is open to all but God speaks to the je in the church they hear the word and the sight act upon the word amen so we are related to God by a spiritual Gene and this gen has the Char of God the likeness and image Hallelujah hallu so being a Son of God you are in nature praise the Lord then he defines his children sometimes he calls them Sons then he Calla them SE children according to First Peter 123 then he call them a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people a kingdom of priests all these kind of says a new creation hallelujah hallelujah you see we are not ordinary people that's why you are able to stand all the trials you through you are not an ordinary person Ephesians 4 verse 24 you are a new creation he says and that he put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness so this new creation is not an old creation [Music] made could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says a new creation it is another creation hallelujah hallelujah in the same body you used to live in your human Spirit area and your manifestations evil wickedness malice but then when God comes then he quickens that Eternal seed Jes and you are totally different from what you used to be in New Creation he wants you to deal he wants to deal with you by the new man new because he's quickened purposely to hear from God Amen and then when he hears from God he causes the outer man to perform that's the righteousness the scripture speaking about so the new B changes the line of command amen is now God to the soul then the soul to the human spirit with instructions to perform righteousness praise the Lord so at that time you are born again the Giant in you is awakened and the enemy Satan begins to set back a new creation oh hallelujah hallelujah you are under new headship when you that level then we can talk about being his bride because we share in his life we've got an instructor we've got a guide he says this is the way walk in it he's a Guiding Light Romans chapter 8 trying to look at where we finish you see I do the best I can so that we may know who we are amen we must know who we are not just a matter of coming to church but to know who we are in Christ amen Romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God the children are SP L for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father hallelujah hallelujah you know you are born you know you are a child [Music] everything father Heavenly Father you know you have a father you are born again you are a child of God you have not received the spirit of bondage but you have received the spirit of adoption so the spirit of our birth takes over our lives and helps us look back to the father where we came from Christ came to demonstrate that relationship Amen to demonstrate was born man but the life on the inside was godone he came to demonstrate that to demonstrate who you are he was man he was subject to all kinds of Temptations amen he suffered I mean trials like anybody would he was man but on the inside he was God he was a greater Fountain but you were a stream of that great Fountain do you understand what I mean the same power that was in Christ making him the Son of God is the same on the side of you making a Son of God he came to demonstrate that he says now you people you do not know who you are you want to show who I am because what I am you must be it takes John it Peter he takes James takes them up on the mountain he takes away the C of time John Peter and James were able to see the Fountain of Life himself hallelujah hallelujah that's what we are and that's what you are this morning you are sons of God by that kind of life that was demonstrated on the Mount of transformation that's who you are don't get blinded by this which can be tempted and sometimes you fall but the reason why you fall is because you were standing I told you here the devil doesn't fall he doesn't fall what is he falling from it's only the sons of God but God rest are you together with me yeah yes sir you know the devil will come and say do you remember what you did yes I remember I'm not there I am standing standing on the can you Standing on the Promises of come on now we sh and Standing on the Promises of God oh don't stand on your own understanding you tell Satan there is something you can't touch on the side of praise God Amen and that's what you are so he came to restore us that spiritual kingship kingship kingship k amen he came to our K which is flesh so that he can rest toward us his kingship his Spirit do you see where we are that's why the Holy Spirit does not come to anoint this man he goes down to the soul toite with the SE gen on the inside to produce a bth amen what's your confidence now first John 4:17 as I finish my my my my my my my praise godship with God the devil will light you and throw you out of the economy of because it doesn't allow you to think the way God wants you to understand the way God Amen first John 47 heing is our love made perfect that we may have the boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world but the devil doesn't know until he tries to touch you he says this man here is just like that man who was here he's very hard to deal you are such a burning call Amen in the hands of Lucifer he tries to get you and then he tries to get you you are a burning call because as he is so are you in this world but because you are behind the curtain of time you may not know that you are the very image of God here on Earth amen so our boldness is that Hest as he is so are we in this presence right now the life on the inside is cleaning the outside man just like the dve does and begins to wash from the inside out and he's doing it remember the things he used to love you don't love themm 10
