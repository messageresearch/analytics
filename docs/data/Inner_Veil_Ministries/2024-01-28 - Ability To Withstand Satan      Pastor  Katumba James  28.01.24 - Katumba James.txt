protection he has put around his children children yesterday when I was walking I slid and fell down in a sitting position I give glory to God for he sent his Angel to take care of me while I was falling and not break any of my bones is the same yesterday today and forever amen we thank God for his protection while on Friday we here in overnight the devil was attacking brother Isaac he's the husband of sister betri so he was admitted in emergency yesterday in ging Hospital so the all of yesterday was actually on most of time of oygen and then they discovered that it was pneumonia which had gone at highest rate so they are still hospitalized in G hospital so we need to stand with the family our prayers and even going to check on them praise the name of our Lord so today we have a married people's meeting in the afternoon praise the name of the Lord and I encourage all my people to always attend you know sometimes when the meetings are put there and then you don't attend them it discourages praise the name of our Lord there are those married people who habitually don't attend I think that is not good praise the name of the Lord we just need to preach our conscious because if the meetings if the meetings are removed then again you'll say again we have this kind of problem they are here to help you praise the name of our Lord so next Sunday is fourth February it's the first Sunday of the month we shall be having the Lord's Supper we shall have the morning service but then in the afternoon we shall have another service but immed after the afternoon service the Lord supper so you come prepared and as we had said last year is that this year by the grace of God we want to have the Lord supper on a monthly basis praise the name of our Lord and then when we have the Lord supper we also have the foot washing praise the name of our Lord washing one another's feet being your brother's keeper standing in for your brother or sister praise the name of our Lord and then again two weeks from now that will be 11th on Sunday we having a visiting Minister from Poland brother is going to spend around the whole week he's coming here on 50th of February we shall be moving with him in different churches shall go with him to We Shall go with him to We Shall go with him to na and then he will finally Minister here on Sunday next and as we have always been doing we always want to bring in our young brothers and sisters who have come in the faith to come and join with us in that fellowship and normally when you invite people it's always good also to feed them much as they'll be fed spiritually but we also need to feed them physically so again I call upon every one of us to make contribution towards lunch for 11th of February praise the name of the Lord sometimes maybe you spend 5,000 for a meal your own so you put 10,000 for the cause of another person being f I hope we should be generous also in that course praise the name of our Lord so we just keep on praying for one another that the Lord may keep us in the faith praise the name of our Lord so this morning our brother and his wife are bringing their baby for dedication so he says God bless you church I thank God for saving my wife when she was in the process of delivery and we also appreciate the prayers from the Saints and today we are bringing back the baby on the altar of God that we can to God who gave us that gift may God bless you sing bring them in US brother and sister brings their child for dedication bring them in bring them in bring in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them be bring down wondering ones to Jes bring them in bringing them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of SE bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones to Jesus amen praise the name of our Lord we are a church that is established on the Bible truth and we do the best we can by the grace of God to stand on what the scripture says because that's where God is exalted in many denominational churches they bring little children like this one to be baptized but there is nobody who was baptized at that age in the Bible even our Lord Jesus Christ when he was young at that age they brought him in the temple for a dedication and because he was a male they circumcised him on the eth day but he wasn't baptized it was until Christ was mature that's when he was baptized and now the Bible tells us that he that believeth praise the name of our Lord the one who conf who believeth and then he confesses this little boy cannot believe cannot confess therefore cannot be baptized so here when they when they brought the children to Christ in Matthew 19 and then verse 13 the Bible says then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said suffer little children and forine them not for unto for come unto me for such is the kingdom of and he laid his hands on them and departed them so Jesus Just prayed for them this what we going to do for the baby [Music] here this is baby jul the Lord has given us a gift to the home of our brother and his wife let us pray for Julius father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ here is little Julius father has been brought by the parents back into your presence you've given this baby to them Lord Lord they are so grateful and appreciative and brought this child back remember Hannah in the scriptures when you gave her Samuel she brought Samuel back into your presence and now you rais Samuel to be a prophet of yours and here is Julius coming before you Lord we dedicate this baby in the name of Jesus Christ bind all forces and all powers of Darkness all Wicked Spirits allil plans of Satan find them and command them in the name of Jesus Christ will pronounce your blessings upon this baby father during his lifetime May stand to serve your heavenly father May stand to do your will for his life Lord may protect him from every evil watch over his life Heavenly Father genetic diseases Society kind of epidemics or any kind of forces B them heavenly father and we pray your protection be upon this child all the time at home School even when it comes the time of being responsible to get a job and a family your always be upon his life we pray for the father and the mother of this baby that Lord you may give them the grace to raise this child in the way of the Lord them heavenly father and open doors for them for places of work and income for the sustainance and the growth of this child theirs the name of the lordes amen God bless you [Music] amen just within I think one or two month or so about two months I think we had between s and 10 babies praise the name of our Lord so I think our c is becoming too small but God give us Grace and maybe those who don't have babies also you should leave the crime for the babies leave the cry for the mothers praise the name of so we happy again to be here let us stand up on our feet let us have a word of prayer father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are again thankful un you this morning we bless and magnify your holy name and Lord we've come into your presence father that Lord you may speak to our hearts Lord the words of eternal life may your Divine will and purpose be done to our lives this morning together Heavenly Father we remember our brother Isaac Lord and our sister betric how they would have desired to be here in the service but they are not able because of that condition of sickness we lift them into your hands father that you may heal our

same yesterday today and forever and Lord we come into your presence Lord to Worship You Lord Lord and to receive from you Lord all the blessings that you've ordained for us this day how we love you Lord and how we thank you Father and now as we got the reading of the word the preaching and the hearing of it may the Holy Spirit himself come down father to have the Liberty to speak to us Lord and release us from every form of bondage and direct us in the paths we have to take May pastors ministers in Nairobi for your glory Lord we love you and we bless your Hol name in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to Ephesians chapter 6 praise the name of our Lord the minister we had in the overnight brother Eric from B he took these same scriptures and then I was inspired that I should take it father praise the name of the Lord so Ephesians chapter 6 from verse 10 to verse 18 the Bible says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for weest not against flesh and blood but against prosperities against Powers against l rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loin got about with truth and having on the breastplate of and your feet showed with the preparation of the gospel of peace [Music] above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fairy DS of the wi and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there un with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen may God blessing of his word amen I want to draw your attention to verse 13 which says wherefore take unto the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day so my subject is ability to withand Satan praise the name of the Lord we need ability to withand Satan praise the name of our Lord and that's why you've come to church that we can be equipped praise the name of the Lord that we can be trained that we can be prepared that we can be energized praise the name of the Lord that we can be raled to how is the devil doing what kind of ways is he doing and you see the Bible says that he has fairy DS fa DS and it's not only one but there are so many many ds he has and the Bible has told us that now Satan now he has a sphere of operation you know in verse 12 the Bible says okay before we go to verse 12 it says in verse 11 that we the devil has got Wes the ones of the devil then he has DS and then not only having those kind of things but then in verse 12 he says we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against prosperities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and you see when you look at the scriptures when for example you go and look at the the dream of NE he dreamed that a a kind of terrible image stood before him and then it had the hand of God and then it had the shoulders and the arms of silver and then it had the stomach or the belly and the thighs you know of [Music] brass and then it had the legs and the toes of clay and iron and then it was depicting the four Gentile Kingdom that are going to be here on Earth then we see that the head of God was the Babylonian Kingdom praise the name of our Lord and then now we see in in the scriptures here that you know when Daniel was praying when we go to the Book of Daniel praise the name of our Lord and then Daniel had prayed and you see his prayers were held back and then the angel came down and told him that you see God heard your prayers in Daniel chapter 10 and then verse 12 then he said unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that th did set thine heart to understand and chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words and then the angel tells him in verse 13 which is my interest but the prince of the kingdom of persa with stod me one and 12 days but L Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remain there with the kings of Persia now we see in Daniel chapter 10 and then in verse one he says in the third of cus king of p a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called B other and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of theion now he says in the third year of cus king of pers now cus was the king here on Earth praise the name of our Lord a physical Kingdom but then there is also an spiritual Kingdom that governs the physical kingdoms that we have here on us and then this is where in verse 13 comes that the prince of the kingdom of Persia so much as we have the lul here on us but then there are rulers who are in a spiritual Kingdom over the kingdoms of the and this is where the Bible has told us in eans CH 6 and then verse 12 that we don't wrestle against the Flesh and Blood about we don't wrestle against the rulers of this Kingdom we don't wrestle against you know the physical leadership that we have but yet there is a spiritual leadership there is a spiritual Kingdom then is calling them the principalities the powers the rulers of Darkness of this world the spiritual wickedness so then you see that this is where Satan stands in now when the scripture says the prince of pers it is talking about Satan as the spiritual ruler of the world Bible says when Jesus was telling them that the prince of the world is coming he was talking about Satan praise the name of our Lord so now every time a kingdom changes here on Earth Satan takes the name of the current Kingdom when it was the kingdom of Babylon Satan was the prince of Babylon when was the kingdom of pers Satan was the prince of pass and right now it's the kingdom of this world and Satan is the prince of the world praise the name of our Lord I want us to get that scripture praise the name of our Lord let us go to John chapter 16 John chapter 16 praise the name of our Lord John chapter 16 and let me get that verse let us start from verse verse 8 and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged praise the name of the Lord he says the prince of this world and that is none other than the devil and Satan now he has the way he handles his systems praise the name of our Lord so the prince of this world is Satan and so Satan has also deployment in different places praise the name of the Lord he has his deployment in all avenues of this life in all spheres of this life he has deployment he has deployment in politics he has deployment in religion he has deployment in business he has deployment in night life praise the name of our Lord you know in the villages we used to fear we know dancers but you know that Satan has put night dancers also in towns they get a building like this and then the night dancers come and they dance at night the whole night spiritual wickedness in Dark Places so he has got deployment in every place night dancers are not only in The Villages but they also have licenses to dance at night praise the name of our Lord he has deployment so now we see that the kingdoms of this world are right now of the devil they are led by the devil so now that's why you must have ability to Satan because he in every sphere wherever you go he will be there not that Satan himself but his demons will be there because Satan is not omnipresent Satan is not omot Satan is not omnicient but when you speak something then Satan knows what you are planning and that's why brother bam says if I'm going to do anything I keep it in my heart but when you mention it then Satan knows oh so then he starts working against that that's why the Seven Seals the seventh seal the mystery was hidden that Satan doesn't understand what is this SE about praise the name of the Lord the coming of the Lord God has hidden it say that Satan doesn't understand what is the time is coming what is the why is coming but then he telling us be you ready praise the name of our Lord be ready because you don't know the time he com now Satan will always come to your level that's what he does if you are in school he will come as a student he will come with the environment that you're live in if you're a business person also come as a colleague if you are a farmer you also come like that if you religious you also come religious he comes to your level when he met Jesus Christ he didn't tell him about sh he didn't tell him about you know things which are contrary to the but then he told him you are hungry and this is how Satan approaches us he comes in your weakness the thing that you desire and that's how Satan comes by place when he got Christ was hungry and then he said but the market is far you know you you can't go to the town and buy any food in the desert then said but there stones here and you are the Son of God let the stones be bright he always comes down where you are being kind of challenged and he tries to give you good suggestions he tries to pretend giving you good suggestions That's what Satan does so when Jesus told him about the word then he said it's time to go for church and the Bible says in Matthew chapter 4 he took Jesus to the temple he didn't take him to the shrine he took him to the temple now who want to go to the temple who want to go to the temple but Jesus was taken to the temple Satan and when Satan took Jesus to the temple he went and quoted Psalms 91 it is written and now the Bible also tells us that Satan has changed himself as an angel of Light praise the name of our Lord let us go to Second Corinthians second Corinthians and then we read in chapter 10 okay I beg your pardon 2 Corinthians 11 and then verse 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into into the Apostles of Christ and Marvel and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it no great thing if his ministry also be transformed as Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works [Music] so amen praise the name of our Lord he says they are false Apostles and they have been transformed themselves as Apostles of Christ even Satan has transformed himself as an angel of life and then he comes this is the truth so now Satan always uses deception to lure us that's what does now in the message life praise the name of our Lord he says and the first thing okay let us start from here it says it is a spirit them women don't mean they don't realize what they are doing like when you walk moving was naked they live their homes short things tight dresses and they walking on the streets it is a spirit Spirit of the world anointing the women to move out when they have no respect for themselves and then he says the first thing you know they start a little bit then a little bit more and is so yes just so sub it comes in it is so beautiful [Music] and that's the way it takes you Satan is attacking he you know releasing his DS he releasing his Welles you know so you get enticed and you want to be like the world oh I need to be a corporate so there's a dress that they have to put on short things above their knees and then sometimes when you get some working sisters on coming to church they have the dresses which are acceptable but when you go to their places of work they put on corporate dresses show off when you something you know it is a spirit that has taken a hold of the people now in the message wisdom versus Faith he says now look Satan could scientifically prove by his wisdom and I'm going to play the part of a doctor here for a few minutes Satan could scientifically prove by his wisdom that the soul that was going to give for human race to grow in vitamins sure he did he could scientifically prove that they scientifically prove anything they want to almost now you see let us look at the vitamins of sat it had vitamin P pleasure popularity Satan attacking pleasure popularity you become a let everybody know let everybody know how you you are bright let everybody know how talented you are let everybody know that your body doesn't have a scar so you undress yourself so he brings in all those kind of things pleasure popularity that's in his wisdom soil sure all the worldly pleasure all the picture shows all the dances all things go ahead that's all right won't hurt nothing see popularity all our biggest church there in the city and then had vitamin C which is referred to as common sense we have a right common sense then says makes reason you see he had vitamin which meant reasoning yeah he could reason but you see that won't work it had vitamin B which is beauty Satan is beautiful sin is beautiful and sin as it begins to get more and more the more beautiful it be enement deception and this what Satan does either you will not fall by this he brings another praise the name of the Lord if you not going to follow by going to disco HS he will come and meet you at church and the Bible says when the sons of of God that gathered themselves in Job chapter one Satan came among praise the name of like then we have all left home but then Satan comes among us and what does he do it starts you lose attention then you start he has come Among Us Praise the name of our God so it distracts you and it is common we are here and we on the highway and then something passes there everybody would want to turn and see what is that Satan but he doesn't stop at that and then he can come here and then uses another root like some denominational churches when it comes to Christmas everybody wants to show off how I have dressed how big offering I'm giving and then there are those who know how to dress and they wait when the preacher is preaching and then they start from behind and every body turns to look at Satan he works in all ways destructs this one here dcts this one here praise the name of and you see if people don't have you know control over themselves Satan takes a hold of them praise the name of the Lord like what is interesting sometimes is the when the preacher is preaching here and then others are outside are conversing Satan why wouldn't you sit and here and then you try to make programs you're outside there why you've come into the services of the Lord why would you sit there and then another gets out picks the phone sits on the other side Sunday school the other side start calling but you've come to Church what is that Satan gets among you are here for only a few time but then why would you allow Satan to take you out supposing your deliverance comes at the time you're not there and anyway when we come to the church we come to present our El before God you just imagine at your place of work maybe that is too far you are conversing with somebody and then the person starts speaking the phone uhh you not even have courage to continue speaking you not have even courage to continue conversing or you've gone in somebody's office now you know I'm some you know those business deals how will that man look at you in his office this man has no respect said okay maybe we shall get another time when and this is what we do to the law we are here for a short time but even in the short time you don't want to miss business deals tell those people to call you after church praise the name of the Lord but this is something that is common oh then you get up but don't you know that is God who has given you that life why wouldn't you have respect for God praise the name of our Lord is when you said that I'm coming into the service of God put all the disruptions aside praise the name of Lord otherwise Satan is going to make you not benefit in the whole but not only you like when you look at the messages brother would tell the people don't move up and down settle in one place why because you grieve the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is working in a certain area and you are disrupting and this is what the devil does to resist the move of God so he comes and brings in all those kind of DS and at the end of the day you come to the service but you're not delivered and to make it worse you get another Spirit which is wrong because once a spirit leaves this person he wants look for another place to enter so you need to be careful that when you come to church be purified be Sanctified not again to be D because of coming with the wrong attitude so Satan is just moving up and down praise the name of our Lord and then he continues to say Satan is beautiful sin is beautiful and as Sin begins to get more and more it becomes how much better house got we today than L house how much more pretty is it how much preter is our women today than they used to be how much prettier is Florida as it was now than when God created it it's got Beauty how many knows that Satan is beauty you know when you read in Ezekiel the Bible says he was an anointed car praise the name of our Lord let us go to eel praise the name of our Lord eel let me get the chap here Ezekiel chapter 28 and then the Bible says in verse 3 behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee in verse 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyus and say unto him thus says the Lord God thou sest up the PSAL full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty so now this king of Tyrus was anointed by Satan and now the prophet is looking at the spirit in the king of tyus and then he says you were in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was th covering the S The Toppers the diamond the Barry the ANS and then he says they were prepared in the day you were created you are the anointed cherub that covers and I said this so verse 14 and God he says I set you to be so verse 14 and I set thee upon the holy mountain of God and thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire th was perfect in thy way from the dead that was created till iniquity was found in thee verse 17 thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty though has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of thy brightness I'll cast thee to the ground I'll lay the before the kings that they may behold thee praise the name of the Lord you know Satan he was an anointed cherub in Isaiah 14 is called Lucifer so we see that Satan was an angel before the Lord and Satan had gifts he had the gift of beauty he had the gift of wisdom praise the name of our Lord he had the gift of singing and the Bible says he had a brightness he had a glory now when Satan fell he lost his position but he never lost his gifts so he fell down with his gifts he fell with the gift of beauty he fell with the gift of wisdom he F he fell with the gift you know of you know music and so on and so he uses his gifts to lure people to get people follow him praise the name of our Lord he used these gifts he used these gifts in heaven to get a number of angels follow him and then now on Earth he's still using his gifts and everything to get people to follow him to get people to worship Him Praise the name of so now back to the message wisdom V's fa not Beauty how many knows that Satan is beauty you know our language may not be able to bring it out and he desired Beauty and triy to create a beauty more beautiful kingdom so forth we know that is in Beauty but then who doesn't want something beautiful so then you have to be careful when you're making a decision praise the name of the Lord be careful sometimes the things that shine are deceptive praise the name of our Lord like now you can say big fire come fire but you you can't use it to cook to die and these are some of the things that puts before us so temporary not there praise the name of the Lord so then he says notice he had vitamin which is reasoning vitamin B V which is now in the paragraph 270 vamin M which is modern or you want to be mod just take his knowledge and find out if you don't believe that stuff it will grow right in you that vitamin will come right up where you are sitting and then in paragraph 7 276 he says but here is one vitamin he failed to tell them vitamin D in there he has given you vitamin P popularity and pleasure vitamin C Common Sense vitamin R reasoning vitamin B Beauty but then in all the vitamins of Satan there is vitamin D hidden there and what is vitamin D that is the biggest vitamin in there the result death praise the name of our Lord he has put death in there that's why we need to withstand Satan we need to see how we can overcome Satan praise the name of our now the Bible says in the Book of Revelation Revelations 12 and verse 7 praise the name of our and there was one in heaven mik and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels verse 8 and prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which receiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the AO of our Brethren is cast down which AO them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loveed not their lives unto death praise the name of our Lord the Bible says they over came him they overcame Satan they overcame Satan and his angels overcame Satan and all his Wes by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony that's why the Bible is telling us they overcame Satan by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony praise the name of our Lord and that's how our Victory comes is you may not completely refuse Satan from attacking you because he keeps on attacking even when Jesus finished him on the Temptations the Bible says he left him for a season in other words he came back again and then he comes back again and then sometimes you can use your neighbors sometimes you can use your family praise the name of the Lord here it was physical Satan in the wilderness and then Satan takes him to the temple then Satan takes him to the mountain and then some place is preaching and then the woman comes up and then he says oh blessed are the the breast that fed you blessed is the womb that bore you she was enticing him taking his attention when he was preaching then some other place is with his family then asking him will you also go then some other place is with Peter Apostle and then Peter tells him you're not going to go to die so Satan uses different points and he can use different people but now the Bible is telling us they overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb that's why we need to be right under the blood of Jesus Christ if you are not in the blood of Jesus Christ you are still a captive of Satan it doesn't matter how you try to do good as long as you're not in the blood of Jesus Christ already captured by Satan praise the name of the Lord so we need to be right under the blood of Jesus Christ if we are going to overcome Satan if we are going to withstand Satan and then the Bible says with the testimony of their mouth what word do you have what is your confession praise the name of our Lord because whatever you confess comes back to you so now if the devil takes a hold of you you need to take a positive confession praise the name of the Lord a confession of Victory a confession of overcoming confession to put you higher than where you are not lamentation negative confession so you don't look at your ability but then you look at the promise of God praise the name of the Lord so we need to be under the blood if you're not under the blood get in the blood of Jesus Christ praise the name of our Lord you know why you need to be under the blood you know that in the Bible talks about the millennium in Revelations chapter 10 reation CH 20 and then in verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be losed out of his prison and he shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the SE and they went up on the breth of the earth and Compass the camp of the Saints round about and the Beloved City and fire came down from God out of heaven and divide them now you see these people here who went into the Millennium without salvation because the Bible says not all the Earth not all the people on Earth are Destro when Christ comes to take over there are those who are left who go through the thousand years and now at the beginning of the Thousand Years Satan is Bound for a thousand and then is you know he's bound so he cannot do anything and then Christ and the bride rule over the Earth A Thousand Years praise the name of our Lord what a glorious time and then the Bible says there will be peace praise the name of the Lord and the knowledge of God will cover the Earth as the waters cover the sea what a beautiful time that will be praise the name of our Lord when Christ is with his bride here on Earth for a thousand years but you see there are people who will be in that 1,000 years without Sal and then God permits them to be there that thousand years and now you can imagine these people being in the presence of Christ but when the devil is released they are deceived can you imagine that why they never had the blood of Jesus Christ so we need the blood of Jesus Christ to wash us to protect us and you know to see that the devil cannot deceive you so when you are outside the blood the devil will certainly deceive you praise the name of our Lord now in the message the conflict between God and Satan he says but Satan is more than a much for us we know that we know that Satan is way more than a much for any human being don't you never try to do it with your wisdom to outsmart him you can't do it Jesus knew this so he sent to the church so that Satan would not outsmart them he placed he a place to be fortified he sent them the Holy Ghost and the church does not claim to be smart they just claim to believe praise the name of our Lord now in the message wisdom versus fa in paragraph 422 he just won't play around he'll do it how can it happen because there is the very life that's in Christ is in you it won't put forth any wisdom it won't grow in it it is go to deny the wisdom that's the wisdom of Satan to take faith faith in the word not wisdom in the word faith in the word Satan has got more wisdom now listen to this he said Satan has got more wisdom in that word than any all the preachers throw together PR and everything so when you come before the word don't seek for the wisdom of it but to have faith in the word and the Bible says faith is our Victory get the faith in the word and when you have the faith in the word then you'll be able to resist the devil you'll be able to withstand the devil so when you hear the word of God believe that word for yourself praise the name of our Lord take it for yourself oby that word and then you'll be able to overcome Satan and all his plans that he has praise the name of our Lord now in the message conflict between God and Satan he says God at the beginning paragraph 6 give his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing there was going to be a conflict there was going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would keep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture what was it the word praise the name of our Lord the word that defeats Satan is the word it will defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we already got the best thing that there is praise the name of the Lord so then you must see that you are established in the word praise the name of our Lord take your time study the word take your time hear the word take your time meditate upon the world and don't just only wait for sunds when but right there at your home right there at your school wherever you are T time and study the word take time meditate upon the word because if you don't know what the word says you live and believe the lies of Satan so God has given us the best protection and that is his word it is the best protection every believer has the right to take this word and fight the enemy everywhere you meet him everywhere you meet the enemy at school use the word to fight Satan at home use the word to fight Satan on the way use the word to fight Satan that's how you withstand Satan whatever Direction he comes in whatever point he is going to use whatever is's going to use take the word of God and stand against the devil praise the name of our Lord and then he says and Jesus proved it when he come so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy when The All Out Warfare comes and the battles are set in AR there is only one thing a real sodia can use a real Christian siia that is US says the Lord I'm reading the same quote walk right out there and meet the enemy with the same Assurance thousand shall fall on the right 10,000 on the left but it will not come near thee what are you doing you are taking the word of God praise the name of the Lord that is in Psalms [Music] 90 so you take that promise let us go to Psalms praise the name of our Lord you take that promise and then you say not this is what you saying praise the name of our Lord okay Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my foess my God in him will I trust praise the name of our Lord he has given us his word he says I'm your protection I'm your Refuge so you trust in that you believe in that and then you don't allow the things the devil is bringing around you you got sleep but you're afraid of the whole night where is your face praise the name of our Lord you know you know there is a a great doctors has come to our village now even me now I want to sell my place and go away why is your protection praise the name of our Lord you know the other man is hard you know we have a boss at place of work he a difficult man the Bible says we don't fight Flesh and Blood praise the name of our Lord take those spirits that are governing him and put them in prayer you'll see him broken down praise the name of our Lord but then you want to be like the rest of the world whenever I sleep I get bad dreams where is your face whenever I sleep start disturbing you need to have the light for those demons to run away check your life is your life right with God if your life is right with God those demons are going to tremble and run away praise the name of our Lord we have had many Believers when they go to a place and stay there all the powers of Darkness become paralyzed until sometimes the land will do as those demons start saying you leave my house you leave my house they can't have rest until people with shrines in that place they start turning against you but you just need to stand by the word of God and all these demons will run away praise the name of the Lord so he says the most high is my protection is my refug is my foress he has given us his word for our protection he has given us his word to overcome every plan of Satan take a hold of the word of God praise the name of our Lord and you know brother Bram says you know when he had been called to the mountain praise the name of our Lord then the sword came in his arm and then you know he held the sword then he was scared said I've been afraid of swords and then the voice said the king is sword the king is Sword and the sword of the king is the word of God and each and every one of us God has given us his sword praise the name of the Lord you have his SW but then you need the arm of faith to hold that SW praise the name of the Lord you know some people when they scared they get their Bibles and then they sleep on top of them you need to increase your face praise the name of the Lord do you have a Bible around at least you give me a sleep with it are you going to read it or you're going to just sleep on it praise the name of Lord get that word inside of you and then have Fai and when you have faith declare what you want demons no more disturbance tonight you just have your deep sleep and then those who are scared will be wondering what time are they coming and they will not come praise the name of our Lord have the arm of fa to hold the word of God praise the name of our Lord so believe it cherish it wait on the Lord sing to the Lord Lord I Thank You Lord I bless you Lord you've given me your word and cherish it with all your heart and then his wores will go these fears will go these troubles will go with this Satan praise the name of the Lord so in that what he says just remember that God made this statement and give this to his children and it's the best that there has ever been yet Satan in Eden when he first come to this attack to attack the person knowing that the children of God was satisfied with the word Satan attacked the word he never attacked the being he attacked the word first how does Satan attack the word by making you not believe the word and that's how it disarms you you have the sword but then he tells you things no longer work may send me a drone drone of unbelief and then you say now now Lord I don't know what to do man has made you put the word down that's what the devil does praise the name of our Lord so the what the devil does in the message the greatest battle ever fall now what did Satan do Satan had others anointed now Satan anoints his servants for sure anoints his servants what does he anoint them with with unbelief can you imagine that God has given us the protection of the and then the Devil comes and anoints you ah this word does not work no Satan anoints his servant he he anoints his servants what does he anoint them with with unbelief I just want us to follow that quote together paragraph 209 of the greatest battle ever F Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to disbel God's word and that's what he does and as long as Satan can anoint you to unbelief the word of God you have weapon he has already defeated you you can't withand him so now God has given us the revealed word in this age take that whole word stand with that word it is your protection it's that gives you the ability to defeat Satan Satan and these demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve God's word now if you want to confirm that you go to Genesis 3:4 let us stand back there and listen just this minute and see if that ain't his first tactic that's the first thing he did he never leaves his same tactics he does it all the time now just see if that that's what it is now you see what the devil does he uses the same trick all the time he makes you disregard the word it does not work these days of you you have no protection praise the name of the Lord so we shouldn't allow the devil to anoint us with unbelief if he anoints you with unbelief he has already defeated you he has already taken a hold of you so now he will swing you wherever he wants to take you go this way go this way you become like Samson spot then you start rotating around with children they defeated so Satan anoints people with unbelief to unbelief the word of God now he didn't disagree with the word he just caused her to kind of Mis control it a little if you know just kind of make it sound like the way he wanted it to some don't take the whole word and that's what the devil is doing are you seeing it even a saved one notary the Bible says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved now for you saying as a you need to be baptized deception and then there are those people every Sunday every funeral they want to get Saed then you start wondering what's wrong with your confession that means that you you are not saved at but you need full Deliverance praise the name of our Lord now like there are some places every Sunday is a Deliverance service and then the people come for deliverance last Sunday he came for deliverance this Sunday has come for deliverance next Sunday what happens to you are you getting half delivered every time then you start wondering where is your face praise the name of the Lord but either this Sunday you come and some of those places they fall down that they are delivered but the next Sunday is the same suay is the same why you pick those demons from why not get total Deliverance and keep the word of faith in your heart that you don't wait for Sunday to be delivered but in the morning when you are praying you can seek your deliverance praise the name of our Lord like now if you are sick will you wait for Sunday service to become un prayed for but where you are you have the word of God you can claim the word of God at any time for your deliverance praise the name of the Lord and that's a true Christian is you don't leave your light in church but everywhere you go you are with the light praise the name of if you meet in a Marketplace maybe there are things that are causing confusion you can speak the condition to change praise the name of our Lord why greater is he that is in you that the devil that's in the world now he doesn't only stop in church but wherever you are greater is he that is in me than the devil that's in the world so in every situation you will get praise the name of our Lord proclaim the word of God praise the name of our Lord and then you'll see how the devil how he will be defeated praise the name of our Lord let us go to the Book of James praise the name of our Lord James chapter 4 and then we read from verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you see the principle submit yourself to God that's our Victory submit yourself unto God on Wednesday we sharing about obedience be obedient to the word so you are submitting yourself to God and as long as you obey God as long as you obey the word when the Devil Comes you just resist him and he goes away say Satan have known what you do get away and then you keep on moving that's how you resist the devil first submit yourself to God obey the word have faith in the word and when the Devil Comes you resist him and he will flee away draw nigh to God and He will draw n to you C your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts you double minded praise the name of our Lord submit yourself to God be obedient to the word and then the faith in the word will come out until Satan I know your trick and then he will resist him and he goes away praise the name of the Lord First Peter chapter 5 and then we read in verse 8 he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a lowering lion walks about seeking whom he may devour that's what the devil is doing he moving like a roaring lion now you can be scared about that but he says Be soad be vigilant because the devil is awake and the Bible says he walks about he goes here he goes there he goes there wherever he can find you if you are not alert that's what the devil is doing so you must be sober all the time you must be vigilant Watchman praise the name of the Lord if it comes this way you turn it away like what's happening in Israel they have defense shields you know like Shields and and now those things are technologically made until they can detect the missile Maybe hundreds of kilomet away coming their so it turns that direction and it sends signals and then that missile blasts where it is coming from or they just divert it now if science can do such a thing how about us praise the name of our Lord just your face the Bible says have the shield of fa and the devil I'm already there then again he turns this side and then you put it praise the name of the Lord let us withand Satan don't allow the devil to put you down God has given us the best [Music] ammunition to put the devil down so don't allow the devil take a hold of you if he brings this thing throw it back to him brings the other put it again away praise the name of our Lord and that's how Christian Life is you need to live a Victorious Life continuously at your home be victorious at your place of work be victorious at school be Victorious Praise the name of our Lord let the word of God guide you in every circumstance whatever thing you doing let the Lord take charge over it and that's how you're going to overcome SI year one year two year 10 years 20 years why praise the name of our Lord and you see the devil is still the same but he moves like a lowering life he walks about seeking to praise the name of our Lord so you need to be VI praise the name of our Lord now in verse 9 it says whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world praise the name of the Lord it says resist him steady fast in faith faith in what in the word so you need to know the word and then know how the devil is working how the devil is attacking and then you know when he comes in this kind of thing you're able to put him off when he comes the other se you able to put him off and the devil keeps on coming praise the name of our Lord he keeps on coming but you shouldn't be scared be armed with the word of God praise the name of the Lord and not only just being armed but let the word be your life praise the name of our Lord so when he comes he comes to tempt the word the way he tempted Christ he was tempting the word but the word know it is St man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out the and that should be the same thing with us I'm living by the word of God wherever the challenge come from stand on the word of God praise the name of our lord it's a challenging time that we are living praise the name of our Lord but the Bible tells us in Isaiah 59 Isaiah 59 and then verse 19 the Bible says so they that fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him praise the name of the Lord so he says when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit of God will lift up a standard praise the name of our Lord any time the Devil Comes the spirit of God is around to lift up that against that attack to combat the enemy praise the name of our Lord but you must keep in the word that the spirit of God gives you the ability to overcome every challenge of sat praise name of our Lord keep yourself in the word keep yourself grounded and when you are in the word keep on growing praise the name of our Lord keep on growing in the word keep the word let us go to this quote as I try to finish in the message putting on the whole armor of God he says I want to ask you something just think did not while she was standing in this great Fortress of his word while she was standing in this great Fortress of his word now Satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of a technique to get her out of there that's what the devil does you are standing by the word so the devil brings a trick it can be his vitamins vitamin of pleasure vitamin of popularity when you want to be popular you get behind the word which says be humble so you should know I am so you already got away from the word praise the name of the Lord instead of being modest really sober understand what you're doing then the devil say some beauty Andress here and you see these are demons these are demons you find some of these celebrate people they know they are known but they want to get farther into being on people's mind all the time they do some of them go and film themselves doing F things and then they put them on the media everybody to read watch talk about them very funny people it's just a spirit it keeps on driving them until they become crazy and some of them poison themselves they kill themselves or they overtake the drugs they are not in their mind so you shouldn't follow such people you shouldn't take such people as your example somebody who is changing men like nothing should not be your reference at all but then you get on your profile you putting such a person you're reading about such a person you are getting the same demons from that person to yourself they're just getting a of you and until you start behaving like them you start talking like them you start dressing like them these are possessed people with demons so don't allow the devil to take you out of the world when the devil takes you out of the world he has defeated you and this is what the devil was doing he used wisdom to take Eve out of the world he say Satan was was on the outside trying to use some kind of a technique to get her out of there for as long as she stayed behind the word everything was fine that's where we make our mistake when we that's where we make our mistake we make our mistake when we get away from behind the word we get from I think you shouldn't move praise the name of our Lord amen should be consistent when you're broadcasting we make our mistake when we get from behind the word so I believe all Bible Believers think that way we get from behind the word when we get from behind the word then we are in trouble but as long as we keep the word ahead of us don't get ahead of the word let the word be ahead of you see you just let it go fast and you just live right behind it praise the name of our Lord very interesting don't go ahead of the word let the word be before you praise the name of the Lord keep the word before you all the time your school keep the word before you at home keep the word before you at work keep the word before you and then the word will protect you from all the powers of Darkness the word will withstand Satan if you bring it into use don't get out of the word don't go ahead of the word but let the word be in front of you everything they bringing to you what does the Lord say about this praise the name of our Lord every decision you make it what does the Lord want me to do in this praise the name of our Lord we go Psalms 119 as I try to finish now Psalms 119 and then we start reading verse 9 up to verse 11 the Bible says Where shall a young man cleans his way by taking he there unto according to Thy Word says as a young man you keep the way of the Lord by taking he to the word of God observe that word verse 10 with my whole heart have i s thee or let me not Wonder from thy commandment word have I hid in my heart that I may not sin against thee amen am I have hid the word in my heart that I may not sin against the Lord be in the word praise the name of our Lord be grounded in the word be established in the word let the word abound in you so richly praise the name of the Lord you keep that word you keep on drinking you are reading it in the morning you are thinking about it you are talking about it you are hearing it this is something you need to do every day of your life man shall not live by bread alone by every word that comes from the mouth of God it should be something continuous in our Liv not only Sunday when you in church not only wday when you come again service but right at your home or at your school or at your place of work praise the name of the Lord you have time to study that word to meditate upon that word praise the name of our Lord let the word be hidden in you you have the ability to withstand Satan praise the name of our Lord Psalms 1 verse 105 he says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light my prise the name of Lord it says Thy word we're reading Psalms 119 where we read says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet you know a lamp praise the name of our Lord you know you can hold it and when you hold it it shows you where you are going you know you need a lamp when you are moving step by step where you're going to put your feet you need a lamp and he says it is the word so your daily decisions use the word this person has told me this but what does the word of God say there's this suggestion but what does the word of God say you using it step by step you know you are looking where you're going you're using the word you're using the word it's a lamp on your feet and you use a lamp because there is a lot of Darkness around there is a lot of uncertainity around so you say now in my life Lord what you want me to do use the lamb to guide your footsteps praise the name of our but the word doesn't only stop at being a lamp the Bible says the word is a light unto my path what does that mean it is way above me and it shows me where I am going how beautiful it is praise the name of our Lord the same word help you in your step by step the same word helps you in your destination I'm seeing the journey the word so take the word of God praise the name of our Lord be in the word be obedient to the word let the word be part of you every decision you make learn to wait on the Lord and say Lord this is the issue I want to seek your direction I want seek your guidance and then you'll be able to withand sat prise the name of our Lord so you're not scared praise the name of our Lord let us go back to Psalms 91 praise the name of the Lord and then verse three surely shall deliver thee From The Snare of the fer and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings sh thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness nor for the destruction that Wast at [Music] day now you look at this scripture he says he will deliver You From The Snare and from the noisome pestilence and then he shall cover you with his feathers you shall not be afraid by Terror of the night nowaday you wake up and then have b a house you wake up when a home has already been killed P Terrors at night so people are just on watch out let me get a dog a dog is not enough let me get cameras maybe let me put alarms let me put a security guard they're not certain but he says he will protect you and then the Bible also says even during that time there are arrows that fly St bullets and you can't see bullet during the time you can't see it at night maybe you can see the fire now he says even those straight bullets like many people are walking on the street a shoot out happens the person is killed maybe they just SE in their shop but the Lord says he will protect you even from those kind of things praise the name of our Lord and then he says even the pestilence that walks in darkness the epidemics Corona people are scared of touching their walls every you want pray even the boat you're using you're not sure whether it is clean pestilence in darkness just coming anywhere but the Lord says he'll protect us so just have the Lord with you have the Lord with you wherever you go whatever condition whatever situation have the Lord with you the Bible says let him be your Fortress let him be your Refuge praise the name of the Lord like there was a testimony during I think it was 2001 or something when they hit the twi Towers in the New York York there was a brother who was working on those there are brothers who were working on those Twi Towers now one brother I think that day he fell sick he didn't go to work then another brother what he did it reached a time he felt he needed to eat something and so he left the place of work and then he went to another building to eat while he was eating that's when this thing was was blessed the Lord knows the time praise the name of the Lord when the enem is planning this he has already put you under his wings praise the name of our Lord and that's the same thing is that God knows the plans of the devil but now God wants us to be obedient to his word the Bible says submit yourself to God and when you submit yourself to you'll be able to resist the devil you'll be protected from the plans of let the Lord be your protection praise the name of our Lord he knows all the plans of the he knows all his Wes he knows how he's planning praise the name of the Lord you know like they had the prophet in Israel Elisha Elisha go would show him the vision when the king of Syria when they were planning to attack Israel and then the prophet would tell the king don't go in this place these people are going to attack you and then until the king of Syria was surprised who rals our secrets God knows everything praise the name of our Lord and they told him there is a prophet in Israel he tells everything that happens in your why wouldn't you want have that God in you and the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord why wouldn't you want to have the Lord with you all the time that the Lord May guide you the Lord may help you to make decisions he knows the best place for you to stay in he knows the best work for you to have he knows the best home for you to have he knows the best thing everything so commit yourself to the Lord submit yourself to the Lord and let the Lord take over your life praise the name of our Lord and you see the devil is deceptive sometimes you may look at something as the best offer but yet behind it there's something wrong but then something is so humble and everybody is despising it and then the Lord says this is the best for you take it gladly praise the name of Lord take it with joy God says it is the best take it and then you watch after time you will prove I made the right decision praise the name of our Lord let us depend upon God in our lives let the Lord lead you submit yourself to the Lord praise the name of our God has given us the ability to withstand Satan make God your friend make God personal to you every life every time every sttion just depend upon God may God bless you amen amen and after we have a married people meeting I think we shall start at 3 Amen Let us sing a song as
