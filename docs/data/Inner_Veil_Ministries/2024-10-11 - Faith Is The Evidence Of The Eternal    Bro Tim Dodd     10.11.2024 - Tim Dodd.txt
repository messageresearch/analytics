belong to the front so we want to appreciate God for all the Servants of [Applause] God they've embraced this message and they are spreading it far and wide yesterday we were Ino and we well over 1,000 Believers there and that's just a few of us amen so uh on Tuesday we are going to be and there is a whole bunch of ministers there so I want you to keep remembering these men in prayer so that the Lord can give them boldness to speak the word amen amen Peter and the rest of the disciples received their Pentecost in the upper room but it was not enough for them for them to preach the gospel they were threatened until they went again and prayed that now that we have got the Holy Ghost give us the boldness to preach the word and now the Holy Spirit came down and shook the place where they were and I think and I believe that the Holy Ghost has shaken the grounds of these men so that's why they've got the ability to stand before those organizations and preach the gospel the boldness of Paul where he stood and said he was waiting for the de when God is going to judge the world his gospel amen so God bless you brethren we appreciate you and keep pressing the battle until we get the last elected one and God bless you [Applause] let's stand up only believe as our brother comes to speak to us only believe only believe amen [Music] only [Music] believe oh [Music] brother [Music] [Applause] two oh f [Music] [Music] all things [Music] amen amen shall we pray Heavenly Father Lord this is the second service the foundation has been laid this morning now Lord take us into the heavenlies open our understanding this morning you may have opened our eyes but now you may you open our understanding we ask Lord you to deal strongly in our lives that we might see the way you want us to see anoint the speaker and the hearer bless this church Lord may you anoint each and every seed of God to take a step higher today may we hear the voice of God saying come up higher we ask it for For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's [Applause] name amen while you're standing let's turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 and then we'll turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 Amen brother James if there was some water Hebrews chapter 11 familiar scripture now as I read this scripture I want you to realize the age that you are called to live in Paul said when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away we've come to the hour of the perfect interpretation of the word we come to Revelation 107 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mystery will be finished we are here now we're not looking for that that's the age we are in then if the perfect if the mystery is finished we have the perfect word if you have the perfect word it will bring you to perfect Faith so when we read about faith you have come to the hour of perfect faith not partial Faith anymore what we come to the fullness of God's Redemptive [Music] purpose amen all right Hebrews 11 [Music] And1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not [Music] seen as we said this morning faith is in the Soul realm for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand but stop just for a moment is telling us by faith we think different [Music] understanding is a mind exercise are you with me through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of [Music] God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen you believe that 2 Corinthians [Music] 4 there's never been an hour where we are so close to our theophany just any moment this Mortal will take on immortality and and this corruptible will take on incorruption and we will Unite with our Heavenly Body and we will see what is now unseen all right now notice this 2 Corinthians 4:18 while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen the things which are seen are temporal or temporary but the things which are not seen are eternal [Music] [Music] now what did we read in Hebrews faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen but the Things Not Seen are Eternal so faith is the evidence of the Eternal the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may have through faith we understand through faith our minds have grasped that the things which are seen were not made of things which appear we did not learn this through education we didn't learn it from experience we learn it from church we didn't learn it from religion Faith tells us there's something behind the things that we see there's more to this life than what we see are you with me you believe that let me tell you if you want to know what the science says now they use a term called Dark Matter and dark energy Dark Matter like substance you could say black if you want or dark okay and and dark [Music] energy don't worry if you don't understand but but they they say that 95% of the universe is made up of dark matter and dark [Music] energy and this is what science says don't worry there won't be a test at the end of they say everything scientists can observe in the universe from people to planets to Stars planet is made of matter the definition of matter is any substance that has weight to [Music] it and occupies space but there's more to the universe than we can see dark matter and dark energy are mysterious substances that affect and shape The Universe And scientists are trying to figure it out they know by how it influences what they can see that 95% of the universe is dark matter and dark energy now let me put it into simple terms there's something out there they cannot see and they don't have any idea what it is that's science science but it constitutes 95% listen now of the influence in the scene realm 95% of the influence in your life is not in this dimension [Music] so science recognizes there's another dimension a dimension of substance brother brandham says that Dimension is more real than this Dimension science says if if you add up all the power in what we can see it doesn't even come close to the power that's from that dimension in other words what they see taste feel smell and hear is only 5% but there's a six sense by faith we understand by faith we are brought into the realities of a Heavenly Dimension now science can see an influence the universe is held in place by the word of God but in the midst of all that 95% of the influence is unseen so let me say what Paul said the things that are unseen are the things that are Eternal but faith is the evidence of the Eternal [Music] the message countdown 1962 Brown said happenings on the Earth are representing something that comes from somewhere else when it strikes the Earth it's usually in a perverted [Music] condition because the world is in darkness and sin but then there is a true representation in the spiritual Realms of the other dimension from being in these three dimensions then the sixth Dimension has its representation now I'm not talking about Dimensions tonight I'm talking about faith tapping into the Eternal can you say Amen to that you see your faith that God has dropped in your heart has more potentials than we realize we have to understand what God has given us sorry we have to understand what God has Jesus came to the on the road to emus and walked with the disciples they didn't know who he was what manner of communication is this as you walk together and they said who are you don't you know what's happened in jerusem how Jesus of Nazareth has been crucified we thought he was the Messiah now they're talking to him but their eyes are holding and that Jesus begins at the at Moses and all the prophets explaining the scriptures concerning himself what is he doing what is he doing he's sewing the word how does faith come by hearing the word he's sewing faith in them that they could know what's happening in their day and they they walk along the road and as they get to emus they stop and Jesus made as though he would have continued on and instead they say no no come in and join us and then Jesus yes he declares himself to them not in words now he already sold the word now he SWS something else his works and he begins to break bread and then they recognize him and he disappears out of the now later on in the same chapter Jesus appears to the disciples again and as he appears to the disciples the Bible said doesn't say he opens their eyes but now it says he opens their understanding now he's moved from the flesh realm to the spirit realm Hallelujah listen if God manifested himself here if we saw a miracle you would say that's God I saw it with my own eyes come on will you believe in miracles we believe in miracles but that's just God showing himself to your five [Music] senses how much greater is it when he opens our understanding amen you see faith moves in The Believer does what faith that moves in the believer real faith is from the Eternal you believe that didn't Jesus say that to Peter when he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God said blessed art thou Simon for flesh and blood has not revealed this to [Music] you you didn't get this from what you see taste feel smell or hear you didn't get it from me you didn't get it from your flesh you didn't get it from some education My Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it Hallelujah Jesus opened their eyes open their understanding and then he said Terry in Jerusalem and this will be quickened in your soul huh amen amen I'm not sure why this is flashing in the background but it's sure distracting take that down I'll tell I'll tell you when to go to a scripture don't try and follow me everybody's eyes are going this direction amen all right so the spirit realm is where faith is enacted Faith doesn't look at reasoning imagination and so [Music] forth faith is anchored in the [Music] Eternal amen when God said to Abraham you see in God's terms faith and the Eternal is not subject to time but faith is eternal and faith cannot be stopped so God says to Abraham you're going to have a son you'll be the father of Nations and Abraham walked in faith getting stronger every day now in this Dimension he was getting weaker every day is that right he was getting older but his faith grew stronger stronger because it was eternal but now because it was eternal it was not subject to time one year five years 10 years 25 years it didn't matter how long faith is the evidence of the Eternal and Abraham grew strong in that Faith even while he grew weaker in his body [Music] now I'm going to show you this brother Bram in the early part of his ministry God was teaching him how to respond to a vision and he showed him a vision of a baby that was sick and that the baby would be healed and he saw in this room a blondhair young man he saw an old woman in a chair maybe you don't have a word for blonde hair in Africa I've got it you got it okay and then I was an old woman sitting in a chair wiping her glasses there was a hat in a certain place why did God show him these things what is the vision it's a prophecy what is a prophecy it's the Eternal thoughts of God not yet materialized [Music] now God was training his [Music] Prophet so he got he got called to this house and he walks in and he sees the furniture just like div Vision he sees the blond haired [Music] boy who was actually traveling with him he saw the baby and he recognized it as the place where the vision took place he's like oh Now's the Time but he got ahead of the time but he said bring the baby and see if God doesn't heal the baby and he prayed for the baby and it got wor [Music] why he didn't pay close attention to the vision you see the Eternal is nothing to do with time in the Eternal things have to be in their place it's not us trying to produce something many times we think the Rapture we're in the time of the Rapture and the year 2000 comes around it's the end of the century 6,000 years of humanity it should be over preachers are preaching now is the time now the time and still here 24 years why it's not a time it's not a day or an hour everything in the mind of God must be in [Music] place now let's go back to brother brandham in that room the baby got worse and he thought what have I done then he remembered oh that hat is supposed to be on this shelf and there was an old woman she's supposed to be sitting in that chair oh he thought I've really messed it up and the only thing he could do not fast not pray not worry [Music] wait wait believing that the vision is of god you see brother brandham was being taught a lesson the Eternal is not subject to time in the Eternal there are things that need to be in their place you know one thing that God never showed brother brandom in that Vision what time was on the clock think about that God never showed him what time the vision God just said when you see this and see this and see this and see [Music] this you'll know it's the time isn't that the disciples coming to Jesus when shall these things be what is the sign of your coming and of the end of the world and Jesus says when you see this and see this and see this and see this you'll know that the end is now at the he didn't say 2027 on the Gregorian calendar June the 3M [Music] that's not what God Said for these things need to be in place that's how the Eternal works by faith we understand the Eternal Elijah came to Mount Carmel and he says now the one God that answers by fire let him be God why he had seen a vision and in the vision he had been shown the keys the keys the the answers he knew what was the right season he didn't know exactly it would be evening time the Bible says it shall be light in the evening time you are living in the evening time light is available to you not because you want it but because God said it would be here it's a thought of God for this age and so the prophets of Baal took up the challenge and what did they do they begin to dance they begin to get emotional they begin to cut themselves they begin to cry out cry out on baale oh ba send us the fire send us the fire we believe in you our lives are yours oh work themselves all day and there was Elijah maybe your God is tired not an ounce of worry in God's Prophet Faith had showed him the Eternal it wasn't time yet he was waiting for everything to come into place he said maybe your God's busy in this age we call that a troll I don't know if you have a word for that in Africa an Internet troll making fun of people oh maybe your God is deaf he wasn't scared of the prop he had seen himself offering the evening sacrifice and he knew his position he knew where he stood for the anointing is not emotions it's supreme power in control knowing understanding exactly what and how and so the evening time came and he rebuilt the altar of Israel 12 Stones and he built up the altar restored the altar biger trench around the and he put the sacrifice on the alt now get some water pour it on the sacrifice and they poured a little on no no no keep pouring because I saw in the vision that trench needs to be full Hallelujah keep pouring it wasn't Elijah's intelligence it was the intelligence of Heaven and Elijah stood there did he get excited no Jesus said the spirit of the Lord is upon me and has sent me to set the captives free preach Deliverance brother said the the mightiest anointing that was on a man luk 4 and he says if you that anointing was upon someone you Pentecostals would think that he would run all over the room and get excited but what did Jesus do he did what Elijah did he sat down and precious words proceeded from with the mightiest anointing that ever was upon now here was the anointing upon Elijah he said now great Jehovah let it be known that I am your prophet and I have done these things at your command [Music] and the fire fell from heaven consumed the sacrifice consumed the Rocks licked up all the water there was nothing left but a burnt spot on the ground Hallelujah because he understood the mind of God he had received the mind of God for that day Hallelujah he knew exactly where he stood having done all to stand stand still the bride has thus sayth the Lord or she stands still amen we have been brought to an understanding am amen now we talked this morning of your mind because Faith operates in the mind realm it's anchored in the soul but it operates in the mind but it's not influenced by imagination reasoning conscience memory or affection faith is only influenced from the Eternal your reasoning can tell a lot of lies to you your imagination will lie to you your affections will lie to you it'll all lie to you but faith will never lie to you because faith is anchored in the Eternal then faith in a pure mind allows you to to see the real you because you are Eternal and what's in the eternity that has been quickened to you on which your theop is [Music] built that is unique to you how many were there yesterday oh my all right I need to get Romans 8 in here then okay now in Romans 8 it says that the whole creature granth and travail waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God [Music] all right is that what it says can you put up on the screen for me Romans 8 I think it's somewhere around 19 or somewhere there okay now what is it telling us see the word manifestation this is good because you can click on this for me click on manifestation what does it take us what's the Greek word here apocalypsis apocalypsis that word means Revelation not manifestation you can go back Revelation chapter 1 the revelation of Jesus [Music] Christ so when it says the earnest expectation of the creature ear the expectation of the creature go ahead turn to it 8:19 I want you to catch this are you with me all [Music] right all right what are the what is the creature waiting for not the materialization of the sons of God it's waiting for the time when the sons of God are [Music] revealed now where are the sons of God written that would be in the Lamb's Book of Life amen Jesus said re Rejoice not that devils are subject unto you but Rejoice that your name is written in heaven it's a greater rejoicing about the Eternal than the physical manifestation where is your name written in the land's Book of Life where is the L's Book of Life it's in the hand of him that sits on the throne but there would come a time when that seven sealed book would need to be revealed what's written on those books the names of the elect of God the sons of God you are written there that's why in this day it was necessary for the seals to be broken the cry went out who's worthy to open the book and no man was found worthy John wept why did he weep because his name was on there every Son of God was written on and if the book could not be open then the Revelation could not be made known and if it would not be revealed who you are there's no way for you to walk in that for all things are by Revelation but the angel said weep not John it for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book loose the seals and John turned to see the land and he saw the land had been slain he saw Jesus who had stepped forth now ET cuz now was the time there had to come a time nobody knows the [Music] time but it turned out that the time was 1963 and the seals were open and what came out from under the seals the revelation of the sons of God because that's what's written on the book so what came from the opening of the seals the message of this hour what came from the opening of the seals the eagle anointing and the eagle anointing as I said last time I was here is an anointing to see yourself the way God sees you [Music] now remember I went to the city of Dothan last year doth the city of Dothan in the Bible elishah and his servant surrounded by the Syrian arm and the servant gets up in the morning and he's full of fear because he sees the Syrian Army that's all he can see amen now he calls out to Elijah Elisha he says we're surrounded we're in trouble our lives are going to end did Elisha get scared no because he could see more than the servant could see and he says there's more with us than there is with them now the servant was trying to believe the message okay if Elisha said it it must be true he's a Vindicated Prophet but it wasn't just believing Elisha's word Elisha lifted his voice to God and said Lord open this man's eyes in other words take the anointing that's on me as a prophet an legal anointing and put it on him who's not a prophet it will cause him to see what I see because what I see is what God sees and the servant's eyes come open now his attitude changes Hallelujah you are so tough out there take that puny Army and go home you don't want a piece of me Hallelujah nothing had changed only his eyes had come under the anointing of an eag to see into the eternity and recognize greater is he that's in US World hallelujah amen it doesn't matter what sickness you have let your eyes come open it doesn't matter what trouble you have let your eyes come open it doesn't matter what you're going through May God send his anointing upon your eyes you to understand that you are anchored in eternity As Romans 8 says what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us or as it says in the Old Testament no weapon formed against you will prosper oh Hallelujah that's why God sent this message so you can see what brother Bram saw even though you're not a prophet even though you're not a prophet but the last days message is an eagle anointing to open your eyes to the realities of Eternity of which you are Hallelujah we need to move beyond our thinking into the thoughts of God all right souls in prison I'm going to read this for you brother Ram says so when you see this man walking down the street he thinks he's somebody you know and got a little education a little educ he has little and things he says you you remember it's a CLA of Indiana [Music] dust he says and that woman that's all dressed in shorts smoking cigarettes carrying on down the street twisting like she owned the whole country it's a clot of Indiana [Music] dust that's the way it's turning back so you're not very much to begin with that's what you are but that Soul that's in [Music] there that soul is what God's working [Music] on if he can only get that nature to of that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies the nature and love of the world [Music] dies the things of the world is dead what's happening a son or daughter of God recognizing the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are not seen are eternal [Music] then he says a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end [Music] so therefore he has partnership and taken this man Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together because God reflected himself back in that he become a man when he become Christ Jesus and he was God God was in Christ Sorry God was in Christ that he says lived in him reconciled the world to [Music] himself now listen and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that becomes a Perfection of [Music] him see the only way you could accept him is to have been part of him from the beginning and when you accept him in your representation in eternity and you're confessing that part of me is more real than this part of me because this part will be changed but that part is eternal it will never be changed I'm a part of God I always was a part of God always will be a part of [Music] God jump down one paragraph for me where it says see the first nature is gone and now we are the nature of him he lives in us we don't do our own will we do his will then what we don't think our own thoughts then he says the mind is what thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every [Music] believer there is the soul that's what we're speaking of that's the part I'm thinking of now and that's what's within us the [Music] soul so what is Faith it's the mind of Christ expressed in our mind Jesus walked by Perfect faith in what the word said he was and through the revealed word we walk by Perfect faith in what the word says we are amen Amen brother says that's rapturing condition that's for every one of us that is that's for every one of us faith cannot be conquered faith cannot be defeated there was a woman the daughter of a oldfashioned Methodist preacher from way back and her daddy was a good oldfashioned preacher quickened by the word in his age under the man anointing but he believed he had Faith he had faith for his daughter his daughter got married she had a couple of children but she had a marriage breakdown and it and it broke up her life but her daddy was believing for her and her daddy and she became a drunkard rather she became a drinker she was raised right but she became a drinker but her daddy kept praying for her one day her daddy passed away and maybe he said to her on his deathbed you're a daughter of God God will come for you I'm believing for you but he wasn't going to be in this realm anymore and it seemed like her life got worse and worse and she was in a certain town where brother Brandon was going to have a meeting and she thought maybe I'll go to the meeting and she arrives at the meeting and it's so full she can't get in and she walks away from their depressed she says God doesn't care there's no hope for me I'm an old woman now this might have been my last chance but faith cannot be [Music] defeated she leaves the meeting she goes to a diner she's sitting there all night she got a couple men in the same booth with her they're drinking there's a policeman over at the slot machine he's got his arm around a a young lady that's not his wife doing illegal gambling it was an evil place but in that meeting not the diner but in the meeting in that town God's Prophet needed a place to eat and the restaurant he was going to was closed on Sunday and so he walks into the diner now some of you will recognize the story and he looks around the room it was he looks around the room sees all the evil and it Grieves him and he says oh God why don't you just wipe the and God says let me talk to you and he goes behind the door and God shows him a vision not of those people's mistakes but of his own [Music] mistakes and he says oh my his mistakes went up before God if they would have reached God he would have been a dead man but they struck Jesus Christ in his forehead and the blood trickled down and he thought oh my God forgive me for my mistakes and he said Jesus Took a a pen or a hand finger and dipped it in his side [Music] and wrote on the page of brother bram's life pardoned Hallelujah now he said to brother BR he says I've forgiven you but you want to wipe them out he goes to the table it was he goes to the table where the old woman was where is he drawn faith is pushing him there not his own faith but the Eternal faith of an old Methodist [Music] preacher my daughter must be saved and the god of Heaven arranged it so that she would be in that room and he sent his Prophet to that [Music] place and God would show him his grace as she begin to talk to him and he asked her story and she told him all those details that I just shared with you what was it the faith of her father though it wait 25 years it'll still [Applause] happen it's the faith of Abraham it's an eternal faith and by faith we understand that time has nothing to do with it my my personal presence has nothing to do with it my personal presence has nothing to do with it but my faith can never be defeated your faith can never be defeated if your faith is anchored Beyond the Veil there's nothing can defeat it and God saw this old preacher's faith for his daughter which was a revelation the world would have said it was impossible but she was in the mind of [Applause] God and when her old daddy died he just believed that it wasn't dependent upon his fleshly efforts it was dependent on eternity his faith had told him so Hallelujah I just think that's an amazing story I always I always looked at it from Brother Brown's perspective going into the diner but then I begin to read the different things he learned from the woman and I realized God thought so much of her daddy's Faith he said the greatest Prophet PA to that place to personally deal with that [Music] woman she thought it's over there's no hope for me she's she's going to drown her sorrows she couldn't see the mind of God but one walked into the room prophet of God a prophet of God that could see the thoughts of [Music] God by a prophetic anointing and she said to him I guess there's no hope for me he said if there's no hope for you why did God show me that Vision the vision was about her oh what a personal God oh if you have a wayward child somewhere don't you worry just say lord they're yours it's not what I do lord it's what you do I'm believing you're going to do something Hallelujah we've come to such an hour to walk in the thoughts of God it's not our efforts anymore it's God's Eternal thoughts Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me Hallelujah all that the father has given me will come to me no man will pluck them from my hand amen God can't lose one brother Steven brother Steven said it at the end of the service this [Music] morning if you have representation in heaven how can God ever let you go that eternity is no longer eternity and God is no longer God but God is God and Eternity is eternity and the word is the word and every predestinated seed of God will come to their place amen amen how many want God's understanding more than their own understanding that's why the word divides between Soul and Spirit in your spirit your mind is everything that you ever thought you [Music] were but in your soul is the representation from God we could talk about the woman at the well nobody thought this woman could be saved no one nobody thought that woman could be saved there's no hope for her but that's not what the thoughts of God said I have needs to go by Samaria just like God telling his Prophet you have need to go buy a diner Jesus said I need to go buy Samaria let me put it to you another way if I don't go by Samaria the Redemptive plan of God is broken you're not looking you're not looking for seed by chance God is directing you God is leading you to this town and that town God is directing somebody to phone [Music] you God is sending them into meetings so that they can know that this is the truth and Jesus said I have needs to go by Samaria and the disciples and their human understanding said what's in Samaria just just a bunch of make Believers they're all out of order sometimes we think Believers are only found in message churches Hallelujah but there're in other places looking for what you have and God has sent you amen says I come I'll be in you and I'm sending you the ones that send you go in you and Jesus had need to go by Samaria because he was perfectly in the thoughts of God hallelujah and he goes and sits by the well he's not looking well we better have meetings in in SAR let's set up meetings let's do something try and create a big meeting no he just just sat down by the well and waited because he knew the will of the father and here she come and he says to her he strikes up a conversation because she was a seed of God and there was something in her that was hindering her from seeing that or put it another way he was contacting her [Music] spirit so he starts out the conversation simple are you following me he says bring me a drink she says if you why why would you a Jew ask me a Samaritan for a drink she was a little sassy she' been through some things in her life she have respect for nobody why are you asking for me then Jesus responds he says if you knew who I was you'd ask me for a drink she never heard Doctrine like that that before oh she came to the word of the hour she's starting to hear things that she's never heard before she says sir the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with and he says the water that I give you if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again oh she said sir ever give me this water and he says all right go get your husband come here now he's zeroing in on the problem she says sir I don't have a husband he says you told the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband and Jesus said she or rather she said sir I believe you're a prophet we know when the Messiah comes listen now she didn't say when the Messiah comes he'll come to this well it wasn't tied to this Dimension but it it was tied to her soul when the word comes it must come to her that's why you received this message because when the word came it was sent for you it was sent to your village it was sent to your village and it was sent to your well and it was sent to your home why because it came for that purpose I have needs to go by Samaria hallelujah amen the Bible says she believed she dropped her water pot she ran into the city she was looking at herself as a sinner that was not redeemable I've been kicked out of the Samaritan Church I've been kicked out of the Jewish Church nobody can help me the devil thought he had won just like the devil thought he won in the Garden of Eden the devil thought he wanted Calvary the devil thought he wanted This Woman's life but he had lost Hallelujah the word was sent to her the devil thought he won over the woman in the but the word came by her way the devil thought he won over Uganda but the word came to Uganda Hallelujah God sent his word to you not because you deserve it but because you're a predestinated seat of God and he doesn't want you to think your own thoughts he's come to tell you what his thoughts are of you let this mind that was in Christ Jesus the mind that was in Jesus said I go by Samaria the mind that was in Jesus said I go by Jero there was a blind BTO there was a zakus the mind of God said him zakus was an evil man but he he was a [Applause] seed it didn't matter what he thought he was Jesus walks by the tree as he's walking by oh he says zakus I need to have lunch with you now there's a whole lot of people there he could have had lunch with but the word sent him to zakus and zakus could stand there and say this day salvation has come to my [Applause] house hallelujah hallelujah amen [Applause] God has come in these last days to show you his thoughts about you the message is not a message of rebuke and condemnation Hallelujah [Music] maybe on the outward this is on the outward with the outer mind with the eyes of a Preacher the preacher might stand in the Pulpit say oh this needs to be rebuked or that needs to be rebuked and maybe it does I don't know but tell I tell you one thing people do need is to know who they are to see themselves like God sees them the book is open Hallelujah Rejoice not that devils are subject unto you and devils are subject unto you but Rejoice that your name is written in [Applause] heaven and because it's written in heaven the word actually means [Music] engraved in other words your name it means in heaven in heaven your name cannot be erased Hallelujah all right we're coming down to a close I hope that was all right it can never be erased you're as Eternal as God is eternal you have a nature that is eternal heavens and earth will pass away but God's word which was God's thoughts which is your name can never pass away there's only one person that fits that description and that is you amen there's only one representation of you that's why when God sends his word into the age it's your theophany speaking to you it's the thought become word spoken through the mouth of a prophet it might not tell you your Earthly name but will show you your heavenly representation in Jesus Christ there is only one representation of you and there's only one theophany that fits you one garment one Heavenly garment in which you will know even as you are known Hallelujah pilot wrote on the cross as Jesus hung on the cross he said Jesus the king of the Jews that was the man's interpretation of who this man was he pred to tried to put Jesus into his own understanding but he was more than that his name Shall be Called wonderful counsel Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace the I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending the amen of God the beginning of the new creation of God on and on and on he wasn't just the Lord Jesus Christ in character he was all those Saints you aren't just Emmanuel but in heaven is written the full Eternal description of your life all right here we go now help me out what's written in heaven yes [Music] what happens when we enter eternity this education Falls by the wayside these physical shortcomings Fall by the way what my family said I was Falls by the wayside my nationality Falls by the [Music] wayside amen my culture Falls by the wayside amen every scar that I have in this realm Falls by the wayside why do I say that because the Bible says in Revelation 21 John said I saw the New Jerusalem the Eternal City of God the Eternal City of God descending from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her bridegroom and God said let me read it I was hoping you'd catch up to me let me [Music] he said he saw new heavens and a new Earth he says I heard a great Voice verse three out of Heaven what does it say The Tabernacle of God is with man that which we studied this morning is now manifested in Bride form and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes amen now he's not saying he's going to go around and wipe this one's eye and wipe this one's eyes and wipe this one's eyes that's not what he's saying he's saying I will make their tears disappear every disappointment they ever had will be gone every evil thing that somebody said about them be no more death neither sorrow Hallelujah there'll be no sadness over there there'll be no depression over there says there'll be no crying over there hallelujah

be there but there'll be no need of interpretation we will all speak the same Lang God bless you Hallelujah God bless you God bless you may get [Music] seated we go through this so have you been blessed by the [Music] service you see faith is the thoughts of God becoming your thoughts simple that's all you don't allow God thoughts to be filtered by your thoughts but God's thoughts becoming your thoughts that is faith God told Moses speak that there could be fles Moses could have Rison otherwise and those FES could not come spoke the mind of God the thoughts of God will you speak the thoughts of God today that you are a child of God that you are born by the spirit of God amen amen so fath is the evidence of Eternal things and so we walk to tamb by the evidence of Supernatural things because we walk by faith are you together with me Christians are specifically driven by the Unseen because faith is looking into the Unseen when you look at the environment as a Christian you fail but as Sons and Daughters of God will look into the Unseen prophetic fa always will tap into the Unseen elishah looked into the Unseen and saw a multitude of angels and if you are going to have follow with the prophet you have to get into his room not you not get him into your room you have to climb to your come up here and I will show you that's the level of Faith where we are now and now the brother says when they go to a mouse he began to break bread he was telling them who he was by the Practical evidence of his life so I also want to say the new B DEC as a new world where in those righteousness and says behold I make all things do not I will not I make but I make on a constant basis I make all things in you if you have my mind meaning the mind of God everything will be made I look at my future through the mind of God perfect faith is based on the Unseen are you together with me so there must be a supernatural communication between this seed and God that's Revelation brother Tim has not been speaking to your mind brother te has been speaking to the ear to the seed chin that's hidden on the side amen so that's the one which God has been communicating to praise God so what can we say we have heard [Music] from praise the Lord so your faith is the evidence of the Unseen you don't have to bring it in your feelings in your emotions think the mind of God and your will be made into that Mind Of God Amen your faith is the evidence of the Rapture brother Bram says the Rapture is in you you don't have to feel it just think the things of God concerning the Rapture how is going to happen behold I show you a mystery those are the things you should move and one day you will be ched like Enoch was your Perfection is eternal you cannot put it in this emotional feeling just take the thoughts of God about your Perfection and that's what will bring will we think the mind of God and the brother in his prayer forgive us for our mind because your mind tells you are not a son of [Music] God your mind tells you are not forgiven your mind tells you are the only son of God now the devil is trying to elevate you but I want tell you let's just think the mind of God and all will come to manifestation through bringing everything to pass God bless you so today we have got another level of faith we always read the message looking to the Unseen but you see God took the brother behind the mind that preached looking to the Unseen God bless you amen we shall brother wison to come and sing some if he still remembers to amen and dismiss the Cong it has been a blessing we shall also ask him to prep dismissing the people before he start singing and then uh may God bless your going protect you keep you the same way kept you com amen Take This Joy with you don't let it go repent of your mind which tells you are not a child of God and you have sleepless nights because your mind tells God doesn't love you just begin to think the thoughts of God amen amen
