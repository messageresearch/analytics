together and to share the word of God Amen and I want to appreciate our pastor and his presence with us God bless you Pastor amen amen so um uh Pastor James is not with us he's on the mission work he traveled this morning and as Pastor has shared he is quite a number of kilometers away from us so we keep him in amen and I want to welcome you to the reading of the word this evening and you'll turn with me to the Book of Revelations chapter 1 and read verse 9 we shall read out a number of scriptures there amen I think our interpreter brother Salas has communicated he has had an appropr meeting that was actually staged from 5 to 6 and he's not able to be with us amen so let's pick up from verse 9 and the scripture says I John also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the iso that is called pmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and had behind behind me a as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book and send it unto the churches the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto smina and unto pamos and unto thyra and unto sadis and unto Philadelphia and unto laia and I turn to see The Voice which spark with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and got about the pups with a golden G and his head and his hairs were like were white like wool and as white as snow excuse me and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass and as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he said he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoed sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength amen may the Lord add a blessing to his word may we be seated amen so I we shall I'll be speaking tonight on the subject of the spoken word and absolute amen so we've picked up from the book of Genesis sorry Book of Revelations where John is introducing the Book of Revelations and he says I John who am also your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the iso that called pmos for this for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ amen so we know the history of this of John we know that John after he had suffered tribulation after he had suffered persecution for the word of God like he said in verse 9 they tried to kill him boil him up and he could not not die so they went and imprisoned him on an island praise the Lord that was full of these uh poisonous snakes and animals and while he was there he says he was in the spirit so he was carried up in the spirit and then he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of it of a trumpet and a voice said unto him I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last praise the Lord so now the voice that spoke to him said he is the Alpha and Omega meaning before him there is none and after him there is none praise the Lord says the begin and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia in verse 12 he said and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks so now there was a voice that spoke to him and the voice was telling him I am an identification that P he's an individual he says I am the Alpha and the Omega and when he turned to see The Voice he said as I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candles the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man praise the Lord so now there was the son of man who was in the midst of the seven candlesticks and he is the one that was speaking to John praise the Lord so he identified himself as the Alpha and the Omega praise the Lord because JN was bearing witness of Jesus Christ he had been persecuted for Jesus Christ so he had known Jesus Christ personally praise the Lord so that's why when he turned to see he says when he turn to see he saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of them one like the son of man clothed with garment down to the and got about the the PPS with golden a golden G so we notice here this man man that stands of the seven which the scripture say the seven Church ages praise the Lord he is one like unto the son of man and his head and his hairs were white like wool and white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like andto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace he's giving a description of the person that he saw in the midst of the seven candles praise the Lord but remember what he said to him when he turned the scripture says what he said he said I am the alpha and I I'm the Omega praise the Lord and that's why we are picking our text he is the alpha and he is the Omega praise the Lord before the alpha there is nothing there is none after him there is none so that makes him the absolute praise the Lord that makes him the absolute that besides him Jesus Christ there is none praise the name of the Living God and he said and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength in his right hand Authority control praise the Lord he had the Seven Stars and we know the Seven Stars were sent to the seven Church ages praise the Lord the Seven Stars which are the Angels which are the messengers that were sent to the seven Church ages so now we see that one who stood in the midst of the seven gold golden candlesticks which is Jesus Christ he had has the authority over the church praise the Lord because the church is in his hands and The Messengers are in his right hand which implies Authority control over the church praise the Lord and now we note something here that out of him out of his mouth went a Shar to edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength a two-edged stro precedes out of his mouth and this is the spoken word this is the word of God it is sharper the Bible calls it sharper than a two-edged sword praise the Lord so out of the mouth of the one who stood in the midst Jesus Christ the son of man who had authority over the church proceeded the two agged sword praise the Lord and now this spoken word are the instruments that he gave to the seven Church ages praise the Lord as we shall see when when John saw and he heard when he looked at him he saw a two-edged sword coming out of the mouth of him that was in the midst of the seven gold candlesticks praise the Lord and now and when I saw him he says I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last before him there is none I am the first so before me there is none praise the Lord he's giving a description he's giving a revelation of who he was praise the Lord remember when Jesus Christ was still here on Earth during his ministry praise the Lord he spoke to us in Parables he spoke when was teaching he was teaching in Parables but could write stand up and say I and my father are one then he could again say I don't speak anything of myself but I speak what I have heard of my father praise the Lord so he was trying to say that he and the father are one so he is in the father and the father is in him but now here he's plainly speaking to John because he said the things that you see and hear write them and send them to the churches so he's ex trying to show himself now to the church he's revealing himself to the church and says I am the first and the last praise the Lord he's now not saying I am like the first but now he's saying I am the first so before me there was nothing so John looked behind and he looked in Genesis when he heard him I am the first he looked in Genesis and when he looked in Genesis he saw in Genesis that scripture says in the beginning there was God and what did God do praise the Lord in the beginning was God was the word and the Word was with go was with God that is in John but now in Genesis we see the beginning beginning with God himself praise the Lord and now he comes down and he starts making creation he begins to create the world and when he began to create the world he was creating the World by the spoken word praise the Lord so he spoke things into existence he could say Let There be this and it was by the spoken word and what did John see here he saw a two-edged sword proceeding out of the mouth of he who in the midst of the seven gold candlesticks and what did he say he says I am the first so that implies he is the first he is the one that was in the beginning who created the world by the spoken word praise the Lord so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise the Lord and this same word came out of God as the spoken word to create things into existence it makes him the absolute before him there is none and he says and I am the last it also makes him the absolute that after him there is none praise the Lord so Jesus Christ is our absolute praise the Lord and he says and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last and I am he that liveth and was dead praise the Lord he does not end there because maybe it could bring confusion to say I'm the first and the last but he needed to show that it is he who condescended praise the Lord it is he who created himself a body of Jesus praise the Lord so he came and he left his throne like the scripture tells us in Timothy that God was seen of angels leaving the throne coming down praise the Lord and after he was done with the work the duty of redemption he was again taken up to glory and the angels saw him going up to Glory praise the Lord so he says I am the first and the last and also I am he that liveth and was dead praise the Lord and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death a clear picture of him he was dead in Jesus Christ praise the Lord he came in the body of Christ and by the spoken word we know that when he wanted things into existence in the beginning he spoke them into existence he spoke the earth into existence he said let there be light and it was like let there be this and there was that praise the Lord And now when he came down when he wanted to redeem us when he wanted to reconcile us from the Fallen rest of Adam the Bible says he sent Gabriel the Angel and he spoke to the Virgin who knew no man praise the Lord and by the spoken word he spoke and she conceived by the spoken word praise the Lord so he has the power to create by the spoken word and when he spoke and says Mary you shall conceive by the Holy Spirit and you shall Pro you shall give PR to his son and he shall call his name Emmanuel meaning god with us so God created himself about in the womb of Mary praise the Lord And now when Jesus comes out praise the Lord And now when he was being baptized we know what the scriptures said when they baptized him what happened there was a voice that came from heaven and says behold my beloved Son in whom I am well beh behoved praise the Lord so now God was confirming that this body here is mine and I dwell in this body praise the Lord so he came to live with us he came to help us he came to fight for us he came to overcome sin on our behalf so the Bible says after that he was taken to Calvary and he died the death upon the cross so he was dead but now here when he speak speaking to John he says I was dead but now I am alive forever more praise the Lord a clear picture of who he is praise the Lord he says I was dead and now I am alive and he says I am everything I am the beginning I am the last I was dead and I'm alive praise the Lord and he says he continues now down the scriptures the word that came out of him the two aged SWAT he sent them out to the Seven Stars he sent it out to the to the messengers to the seven Church ages and when we get down in the Book of Revelations chapter 2 verse one he says when he began to speak he sent specific message remember the Bible says it is he who stands in the midst of the seven gold candlesticks it is he who stands in the midst of the seven Church ages he's in control of the church ages he praise the Lord from the first church age of Ephesus to the last Church age of the aition where we are right now praise the Lord so now he begins to speak to the churches he's trying to reconcile he's calling to he's trying to call a church himself he's trying to prepare the people of every age to receive him praise the Lord so he can reconcile them to himself to direct them to the absolute so he says unto the angel unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right now he begins to speak these things says he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he holds the church in his right hand he holds all the Seven Stars in his right hand praise the Lord so that means it is he who sent the Seven Stars it is he who sent the angels to every Church age so every Angel every messenger that came out to speak to the age did not come to speak of himself but they came to speak the word that God had given to them for their age to the first church age he says right these things says he that holdeth the Seven Stars in is right hand who walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks then he goes down to the SK Church in verse 8 and to the Ang of the church in smer right these things says the first and the last and which was dead and is alive he's describing who he is and he goes down in every aspect describing himself as the first and the last before him there is none and after him there is none he is the absolute praise the Lord and now he has absolute power over the church he has absolute authority over the church because the church is in his right hand praise the Lord he directs the church praise the Lord and his ultimate goal is to bring the chge to himself praise the Lord is to point every believer to Jesus Christ that's why every message when Paul was speaking he was directing the people to Jesus Christ and not to himself praise the Lord when we see the message ofam he's not speaking of himself he never pointed people to himself even if wanted to make him an object of worship he rejected it and he opposed it every time he wanted worship him he says he was pointing the people Jesus Christ because it is he who is in control who has authority over the church praise the name of the Living God he says unto the Ang of the church in SM right this things says he the the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art Rich he knows the tribulations of that age they struggles in their body and says I know when you get tired of life I know your tribulations I know your weaknesses I know your challenges I know your struggles you call yourself poor and yet you are rich why because he has absolute power praise the Lord not only to control not only to guide but also to supply praise the Lord he says you call yourselves poor but yet you are rich why because I am in the midst I am in control over the church praise the Lord I was dead and yet I am alive and we know that he's alive and he's not alive in the heavens but he's alive and he lives in Us Praise the Lord because we know when we read the Bible in the scriptures when he was here on the third day after he's Resurrected and he was going up to Glory the scripture tells us that when Jesus was still here he made the disciples and then on the last day that he was here on Earth he led them up and when he led them out in the book of of of Luke chapter 24 from around verse 45 downwards when he was speaking to them he commissioned them and told them to go and teach but then he told them but first wa wait until I come back praise the Lord he says I have commissioned you to go and teach I have commissioned you to go and direct people to to my to me but first wait why because he says I must make myself known to you that I am alive in you forever more praise the Lord and on the day of Pentecost he came down and when he came down he made himself known to us in the form of the holy spirit that he lives in US praise the Lord so he was dead and is now alive and is's alive in our lives forever more and now here he tells them I know your works I know your tribulation and poverty and I know the blasphemy of them which say that are Jews and are not but are synagogues of Satan fear none of those things which you shall suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison he knows why because he's at the Center of authority he's in the midst of the church he's in our lives he's in the church praise the Lord he's back and he lives in the church and he says I am alive and I know that Satan shall not leave you to go free he shall not leave it to go called free so he shall come and cause tribulation and he shall cast some of into prison and you'll be bound in prison physical prison spiritual prison but he says that you may be tried in the prison of this body we are tried in the prison of this body we go through persecutions and tribulations and trials we go through all the sufferings but he says I know your works and he says you shall have tribulation 10 days but be thou faithful even if it means death be faithful unto death and I'll give thee a Crown of Life be faithful be thou obedient be thou honest I am alive and have control and I'll give you a Crown of Life praise the Lord and in verse says and unto the end of the church in pagamos right these things says he which has the sharp sword with two edges and unto the angel of the church in the right these things says the Son of God who has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like fine brass and to the angel in in Philadelphia WR this things say he that is Holy that is true he that has the Key of David he that opens and no man shuts and shuts and no man opens these are all descriptions of who he is that he's in control and exercises control and authority over the church praise the Lord so now the church the one who is in charge of the church is not an individual but it is Christ himself praise the Lord he's the absolute of the church and he says now to the angel of the Church of lodia right these things says the amen amen means finished the faithful the true witness the beginning of creation of God praise the Lord he now comes here and CS it and says he is the beginning of the creation of God and how when did God start creation and how did he create he created by the spoken word praise the Lord confirming the scriptures John chapter 1 verse1 brother you can give it to us in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God praise the Lord and next and they said the same verse two the same was in the beginning with God and here the scripture says this Angel write these things and when Jesus began spoke he says these things sath the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of God and here in verse two it says the same was in the beginning with God praise the Lord so now if the same was in the beginning with God and now he say says here that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God himself how did the word become God himself when he created the body of Jesus Christ praise the Lord he became flesh and he became the Living Word before the world praise the Lord and now he says the beginning of the creation of God God created the word by Jesus Christ Christ the spoken word praise the Lord and like we read last week in the Book of Revelations chapter 19 we know that the Bible calls The Testament of Jesus Christ and he calls it the word of God and which is Christ himself so now he's trying to reveal who he was from the beginning and now here he CS it up and says he was the beginning of the creation of God pray praise the name of the Living God so now we see that he stands in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the churches and he gives a specific message to every Church to the angel Ephesus right to the angel at seminar right the angel at sis right the angel at Philadelphia right the angel at at lishia right and each of them we are given a message each of them we are given the word each of them we given instruments each of them we are given directions to Point them to the absolute Jesus Christ praise the Living God and now we see him walking in the midst we see him walking in the midst and as he's walking the midst he's guiding us he's directing us he's teaching us guiding us through life teaching us his statutes showing us his Mysteries preparing us every day he's preparing our hearts he says I know your weaknesses but I sit because I am alive I see in your life I know your weaknesses and I will help you to go over them he says I know I know your tribulations I know your trials I know that thou art weak but Thou Art strong because he lives in Us Praise the Lord guiding the church every day and pointing the church to himself Jesus Christ the absolute praise the Lord alive in the church forever more now the word absolute means the ultimate means the one that is complete it means the one that is final praise the Lord the Ultimate Reality of the most fundamental being the most fundamental entity considered Beyond human perception or comprehension and it represents something unconditioned infinite perfect praise the Lord timate truth so now when Jesus Christ is presented and presenting himself as the absolute it means he's the ultimate it means above him there is none so if above him there is none that Jesus because that's what he calls himself here and that's what the scripture tells us he says I am the first and the last a revelation of who he is so if he's the first and the last that means in the beginning it was him and in the end it is still him praise the Lord who stands in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and now through the church he's been presenting himself in different forms trying to guide the church as the spoken word praise the Lord he condescended himself and he made himself the word praise the Lord like John saw a two-edged sword proceeding out of the mouth of his mouth and then he begins to guide the church by the spoken word he begins to teach the church by the spoken word he begins to prepare the church by the spoken word guiding the church and teaching us and preparing us for what for that marriage of the lamp praise the Lord because that is the capson of it each of us our prayer the goal of every Christian is everlasting life praise the Lord it is not to live a life here a holy Life as a Christian but our goal is everlasting life praise the Lord and the day we become Christians the day we become Believers the day we are born again and like the Pastor was teaching Us in the in the daily edifications that that new birth which is the day Christ is born in your lives the day you receive the Holy Spirit he comes to stay praise the Lord he lcks himself in he gets through these courts from the body to the spirit to the soul and when he gets into the soul he locks himself in there praise the Lord and when he locks himself in there he begins now to guide you he the Bible calls him the seal until the day of our Redemption praise the Lord so now all along the way he begins to guide us and to teach us he begins to direct us to encourage us in our weaknesses and says you are strong in your weaknesses you are strong why because he that is in US is stronger than he that is in the world praise praise the Lord and now in Tribulation he says I know I know that you'll be cast into prison and you'll be tried and different trials shall come your way but says be thou faithful be thou honest hold fast to that which you have believed let our eyes let our faith always be pointed to the word of of God because it is our obsolute Jesus Christ he says in those trials and I know he will come and he will cast some of you into prison like the brother was singing some through the waters some through the fire some through great sorrow he will cast us into different prisons but even in those prisons he says I am present with you why because he lives in Us Praise the Lord to give us strength for the season praise the Lord in that second Church age when the church was taken into the dark edges when the church the Believers the Disciples of Jesus Christ were persecuted some of them were killed praise the Lord like I told you what the prophet was saying about a certain man who wrot and says but where was God in that time he said I was there with you I know that the devil will cast you into prison and you may think that you are poor and your strength is low but you are are strong because I am with you he was with them in Dark Ages even when they killed them his grace was sufficient for them in that day praise the Lord that's why he gave them the grace some of them saw the fire the fire was set and they asked them to denounce Jesus Christ and they never denounced he gave them the grace to have the courage to enter into the fire praise the Lord he was present with them praise the Lord that time he could not save them all from the fire though he had the capacity to do it we have seen him save so many from the fire we have seen the Hebrew children when Nebuchadnezzar laid the fire the furnace and because they had refused to Bow Down and Worship his God the the the golden image that he had made and because they refused to worship the image and they set the fire and God came down and save those children from the fire but in the Dark Ages he could allow them to get into the fire and they could be consumed by the fire because that's the grace that he supplied for them in their day praise the Lord that why he says I know some of you shall be cast to prison some of you shall be cast to the fire but my grace is always present with you praise the Lord in the fire he's present with us in the floods he's present with us in great Sorrows he's present present with us in our weaknesses he's present with us he is the absolute because he has the control over the church praise the Lord and you know there's a time when H he gave a vision the vision to to Ezekiel the vision of the bones and he showed him the he carried him into the spirit in a vision and now he took him to the valley and began showing him the the dry bones praise the Lord and now he want he showed him that there was power in the spoken word he told Ezekiel speak to the bones he first asked him in verse three we can find that in Ezekiel chapter 37 and now he said son of man can these bones have life again but because Ezekiel was a prophet he looked at himself and says I am just a man and my faith faints he says it's only you who knows because you are the absolute you know from the beginning to the end it is you who knows what is going to happen tomorrow because you have planned everything he says it is you who knows praise the Lord and he says now speak to the bones and in verse four he says again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus says the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live he speaking to the dry bones the bones were there maybe the people had died and you know there were sculls scattered by the power of the spoken word he said speak to these bones speak to these bones the spoken word was given to him the two-edged sword that proceeds out of his mouth the that teaches and guides the church through all truth because he says when the comforter comes in other words when I come I shall guide you through all Truth by the Spoken Word by nothing else but by the spoken word praise the Lord he says prophesy unto these bones behold I'll cause breath to enter into you and he shall live and I will L SS upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord the power of the spoken word we have the word of God in us we have the word of God in us because if he lives in us the word of God lives in us he says by the power of the word speak to those bones so if that God had the power to speak to the bones to give them life he has the power to speak to us to speak through our challenges to speak through our weaknesses to give us strength for the day praise the Lord he has the power to teach us his word to teach us his statutes to help guide us to his truth because he say speak to them again tell them ABCD and I will and so I prophesied as I was commanded he was a prophet be obedient be faithful to the end he says as I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and Bones came together Bor to his bone and when I beheld L the snils and the flesh came up came up upon them and the skin covered them above and there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and said to the wind thus says the Lord God come from the Four Winds or breath and breathe upon this Lane this Lane that may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great Army that is the the power of the spoken word the word that lives in Us Praise the Lord he said son of man these bones can they live and as a human because our faiths faint our faiths fail praise the Lord because we weak because of the challenges and struggles but if we can stand like Ezekiel and recognize the power of the spoken word and know that he is the absolute and with him all things areos we can speak to our situations praise the lord we can speak to our condition we can speak our challenges by the power of the spoken word because there is power in the word of God praise the Lord and when we were Fallen we know that he condescended and he came down to fight for us he came down and he went through the Temptations He was tempted like any of us and he overcame those Temptations that's why he says I have overcome the world praise the Lord so because he overcame the world we can also overcome the world why because he lives in us on the day of Pentecost he came down to live in us and is here to work upon us until the day of our Redemption he's not living the absolute lives in us and is's alive to guide us to the day of our Redemption praise the Lord and now in James he says is en sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him why because the elders are appointed of God praise the Lord remember what he spoke when he was instructing John to write he says the things that you see write and send them to the seven churches and now give these instruction to the seven churches give them these Vues give them these powers and here he says is any sick among you in other words is any sick is any weak in our midst we have the absolute in our midst to speak strength to the weak Spirit to men the broken hearts to heal the sick and strengthen the weak he says is any sick amongst you let him call the Elders of the church James 5:14 is sick let him call the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven of him why he is the absolute he has power to forgive praise the Lord so is there any sinners in our midest let them come let them come to him he's the absolute he has ex he says he authority to forgive sins and if we are Meek and if we are obedient and come to him he is very just to forgive all our sins he is very just to heal all our diseases he is very just to give us strength to overcome all our challenges in life he is the absolute in our moments of weakness praise the Lord he says come let us rason together even if your sins be too much like Scarlet I shall cleanse them and they shall be as white as snow praise the Lord he is the absolute says come come to me the message says come to him the message of today is not introducing Branham the message is not about the messenger but the message is about Jesus Christ praise the Lord the message is not speaking about how Bram and ABCD no the message is speaking to us life because Jesus Christ is our life praise the Lord says come let us rason in every message he spoke to the messengers it is come let us reason together if you're weak I'll give you strength if you're a sinner I'll forgive your sins if you're going through difficulty I know and I'll give you Gra Grace to come out of it come let us rason together praise the Lord at that time the people had fallen they had gone astray Israel had fallen and they had begun worshiping other gods and now God comes down by his spoken word and he took up Isaiah in a vision and began speak to him and says go and tell the people they have sinned and I can't forgive their sins they have sinned and I will close my ears to their prayers I will not listen to them I will not even see their their sacrifices that they offer to me but again he is a gracious God he's full of Mercy praise the Lord again he told him but ask them to come let them come to me and let us rason together even if they have sin and they have gone astray I will forgive their sins because he is a God to us and and he wants to reconcile us to himself that his mission praise the Lord he wants us to be by his sight because he has the church in his right hand praise the Lord exercising authority over it and if heising authority over it how shall be a go to us if he not forgiving he says come wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before Thine Eyes mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well that is the message to the church the message is to reconcile us to turn away from Evil to turn away from sin to help us praise the Lord recognize his presence in our midst he says learn to do well that's the message of the hour is to align the bright to the word of God praise the Lord is to dress Us in the word to dress us in our robes learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come now let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool a forgiving God praise the Lord very rich in Mercy praise the Lord thus why the says his mercies are new every morning and they endure forever the mercies of God are still present for the church come turn away from sin why he says I it is I who was dead and now I am alive his blood when he died he let his blood start flowing to cleanse the church to cleanse every sinner to cleanse us from our weaknesses to cleanse us from our Sports to cleanse all iniquity his blood is still flesh bleeding for us praise the Lord he says come the blood is still flesh wash yourself daily in the blood wash yourself daily in the blood because the blood is still sufficient he knows we fail and we become weak and our faith faint but he is a very just God that he has given us away Jesus Christ God is provided way for the church that we can be reconciled every other moment moment to himself praise the name of the Living God and that settles it the prophet says that settles it it is the amen it is the absolute it is the ultimate when Jesus says ask the father anything in my name why because he is the absolute ask anything in his name I'll Grant it now that's an absolute that's an ultimate that is it whatever you ask whatever have need of When you pray believe that you receive it you shall have it that settles it that's all of it see if we are really anchored and receive it we've made him our absolute because he does he is the absolute that takes us from all fear there is no fear when you are really tied to the Rock of Ages there is no fear when you are tied to the word of God it is the Rock of Ages Calamity May strike but you are anchored in the Rock of Ages challenges waves may come but you anchored in the Rock of Ages because he is the absolute then he said in paragraph 96 if you abide in me he he is the word my words is abiding in you you can ask what you will I know it then if Christianity was the word of God and he was the word and by accepting the word the word lived through him then I know if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will if you are in the word and are part of the word you'll only ask that what the word tells you to ask know the day you are living then ask accordingly he says if you are in the word you will know the will of the father and you not ask things outside his will because you know his will so you'll ask things within his will and whatever you ask in his name he shall provide praise the Lord and says in the message spiritual food in Du season Jeffersonville 1965 is like a l of old s if God be God then serve him if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him if he's the center of your everything then you ought to Lo leave everything lose and cleave to him why because you recognize he's your absolute remember he is the center he is the North Star he is the ultimate he is the absolute and if it's the North Star there is only one thing that will point to the north star that's your compass that your sailing with and the campass that I'm trying you to sail with is the word of God and the word always points you to him Jesus Christ Our obsolute Praise the Lord and in the message partos Vision 1949 and I turned to see quoting Revelations 1:2 of where we read and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see The Voice oh I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word when John turned to see he turned to see the voice but when he turned to see The Voice he saw one like the son of man he saw Jesus Christ so Jesus and the word are one the absolute praise the Lord so the absolute and the spoken word the voice that came out of him are one and he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were created by Him and without him was not anything made that was made if you can ever get to really see the word you'll be seeing Jesus Christ because when John turned to see he never said I turn to see the man but he turned to see the voice that spoke to him and when he turned to see what did he see one like the son of man praise the Lord but remember when he saw he saw a two-edged sword proceeding out of his mouth the spoken word so the spoken word and Jesus Christ are one and Jesus Christ is our absolute so if Jesus Christ Our absolute that absolute is alive in our lives if the absolute the ultimate is alive in our lives he says ask anything in my name and it shall be given unto you so that absolute and the spoken word are alive in our lives to guide us every day to teach us his statutes to guide us along this walk to show us our paths to show us our weaknesses and also help us to come out of them because by his word through the word we get to know our weaknesses but again he GES us through our weaknesses to himself he is a gracious God he is a merciful god praise the Lord and his grace is here with us to guide us through this journey and his ultimate goal is to see the church in the Rapture his goal is to see the bright on the wedding on the wedding supper so he's preparing us by his spoken word every day through the message of the hour through the word through the teacher teachings of the Prophet through the teachings of the ministers teaching us and preparing us for the wedding supper that is the ultimate purpose of Jesus Christ Our absolute may God bless you amen we make amen let's get on our feet as brother Moses leads us into worship amen he's here to guide us and his grace is sufficient for us praise the Lord he will guide us he has not saved us to lose us he has not given us his Spirit to lose us he he's been made he has been born in us to guide us until the day of our Redemption so through our weaknesses let's look at the ultimate let's look at the absolute Jesus Christ praise the Lord I know your weaknesses I know your works I know that you cannot bear those that are evil he says in every age I know I know I know and if he gave Grace to this to the church age if he gave Grace to smina in the Dark Ages and they pointed to the fire and they moved through the fire they were killed and never denounced Jesus Christ if some of them were cut a s and they never denounced but he gave them that Grace to Bear the pain for the word for the word for the sake of the word he shall give us the grace in this journey that we are leading praise the Lord he shall give us grace through our weaknesses he shall give us Grace to overcome all the trials and persecutions that may lay in our journey because he is a gracious God who is in control over the church and he does not only guide us but he says you know that you think you are rich you are poor but yet you are rich he supplies and shall supply for all our needs because he is Jehovah J praise the Living God let's bow our heads before the brother leads us into worship precious
