there then we shall be going as the Lord will lead us as Pastor kba has announced we shall follow indeed as the spirit leads one spirit and one ACC and I love services like this because I believe whoever gives his his time whoever is here has sacrificed his whole time there nothing to panic nothing to hurry and I believe among here I'm the Fest person and I have to go back before I forget will you do you want me to take your greetings toana and we welcome you all in atast those who never knew me possi you have been hearing about me so now you have seen me time you are passing that area free to visit us there and when you hear your pastor is coming don't hold him don't hold him we him also has also been passing by us this time we want him full so we love you all now let's proceed with this service yeah because I could forget that when Iana I don't know what I tell them so verse 3 we are in chapter 12 just we start from verse 38 read some few verses I know the is taking us somewhere we are in communion service if you want to title it just call it communion service we shall just here and there just trying to build our communion service and mixed M went up also with them and frogs and HS even very much and they baked anded cakes of of do which they brought forth out of Egypt for it was not Liv because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not t neither had they prepared for themselves in v verse 40 now the souring of the children of Israel who wred in Egypt was 430 years and it came to pass at the end of the 430 years even the same day it came to pass that all the host of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt verse2 it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt this is the night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their Generations 43 and the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron this is the ordinance of the Passover there shall No Stranger eat there but every man that is B for money when thou circumcised him then shall he eat thereof a foreign and servant shall not eat there one shall it be eaten Thou shalt not carry Force out the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall you break a bone thereof listen verse 47 all the congregation of Israel shall keep it verse 48 and when a stranger shall joury with them with thee and will keep the Passover to the Lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall get thereof may God bless the reading of the word we can get seated I know some of you are tired so this was the order of the Passover in the Old Testament they knew there were people who were among them but who were not Israelites when the Passover came when they would come to eat the Passover this was remembering the day they left Egypt when God told Moses to order every house and sprink on the door and we know all that was typing Jesus Christ and whichever house had the sign of blood the Ang of Des could not reach that if you were a if you are an Israelite and you refused that order in your house you every firstborn had to die no matter whether you are an Israelite as long as you refused that so the word of God is your life you have to take God at his word and believe every word that has come from the mouth of the Lord ordered them to always observe that and what what we are going to do now it is exactly like what they were doing in bless of Lord now this is our age this is how we are doing it because Jesus Christ came as a real sacrifice who offered his blood and that's why he said we should do itance of his death in remance of him Prophet remembering the remembering the Lord we have to always remember the Lord commanded the children always to observe the Passover and he [Music] said must take hallelujah hallelujah that's what I was saying in the morning that this is for every Christian every Christian is supposed to observe this ordin the ones which take us deeper in the RO blessed be the name of the Lord now here we see he said he commanded if there be any servant cannot take it unless he circumcised and once he circumcised is like one of you blessed be the name of the when you look at denominations how they do it they also know this truths and therefore they teach it their way if you do not follow their teachings levels you cannot also take their although we know that the communion that is taken in denominations is aong is wrong communion some take it in the morning some take it in the afternoon and yet theer and the children of Israel they took it in the evening so you know these days we are restored back the original faith we have we built on the foundation the apostles and Prophets Testament and New Testament the Old Testament was a shadow of the New Testament the Old Testament was a commandment and every Israel had to take it it was a must and everyone that was not an Israelite had to take the sign of Israel by being cumis and circumcision today the baptism of the Holy Ghost now today we know in the communion like this we cannot expect someone we cannot expect someone to come and take communion when he has not received Jesus Christ as our savior has not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so that he can be called the circumciser blessed be the name of Lord so we have to follow the protocols of the word of God hallelujah the prophet says taking us back to the to the Old Testament he says now in the Old Testament blessed be the name of the Lord I will just try to be as fast as I can so that at least I can mention some few more words he says now in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statute an ordinance an ordinance take an ordinance and so is water baptism so is f washing and ordinance so is the blessed be the of in the old okay let me continue reading I just not go are are we together ordinance after ordinance ordinance ordinance chanve then listen the prophet says so is the lorder then he says blessed is he that does all of his ordinance and keeps all of his statute all of his Commandments that he might have a right to enter into that threee right Hallelujah huj so it is up to you if you want to enter into the true of life you have to observe all the ordinances simple you have to be a Christian you have to be Christ right you have to do what the apostles did you have to walk in the footsteps of the Apostles that's what we are supposed to do Hallelujah Hallelujah that is a true Christian if you want to enter if you don't want it is up to you blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now let's proceed with that quotation now Noti this now that in that fast when it was first an ordinance of God to bring sacrifice to the church and to the temple and the Altar and offer your gifts and your sins the sacrifice of where I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road knowing that he was guilty and he goes to the Altar and brings his fat o bar or whatever he had he brought it down the road as sincere as he could come he walked up there keeping God's ordance just a as he could be blessed the of Lord the Old Testament they were doing it sincer someone would give his his with a sincere heart and goes to the priest and offers it so they were doing it sincerely so the same thing we must do everything with sincerity hallelujah hallelujah then he laid his hands upon upon it remember this is for the remission of sins and these sacrifices would only cover their sin not remove them these LS they were they were typing a genuine L the L of God Jesus Christ for was not to cover our sins but he came to remove our sins he came to take away all our sins but look at this shadow what we have now how sincere they were then how much more sincere should we be today we have the most genuine one blessed they were very sincere in the offering of the sacrifice he just bring it down and raise hand the name of the Lord and confessing his sins like what we have to do today you have to confess all your sins whatever you have done whatever you know is not right this is an opportunity for putting yourself right just repent to the Lord his his Mery is here for you and me my brother my sister so they would put their hands on the sacrifice professing his sins and the priest placing his his upon the he he was confessing literally would go in the hallelujah hallelujah know Pastor loves teaching such things you know the depths of them so I'm not going any deeper I'm just passing byess the name of so this take your sin you would it there it would Beed blood flowing your sins then the L would take your sin blessed the name of the Lord and that L of God is here now as you confess your sins he here to take them away and you live here when you are a new Christi blessed be the name the Lord so let's first get it from the Old Testament pressing his sins upon the L and the L's throat was cut I want you just let us go go back there and see take it in the and see is there you are placing your hands there is flowing over you and your sins are going Hallelujah the sin are going listen to this the L throat is cut and died for him as he the L died for him hallelujah hallelujah as he laid there the little L kicking and breeding his hands being full of blood anding all over him he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die hallelujah hallelujah he would realize I would be the one to die but this this has died and taken my he would leave a new preure how much more should we realiz what our Lord Jesus Christ did for us not only but still doing it even now in your life in my life my brother Hallelujah let us just confess our sins he's here to take them away throw them in the sea of for never to be remembered anymore it is up to you now as this man had to come physically this is what I was saying in the morning these are physical ordinances which we must do physically now if you were here in the morning and you have gone home for you you have taken the other communion by this time you have missed it physically you are supposed to come your and present your issues to the Lord take them away hallelujah hallelujah he's here to take them away so you are here my brother please don't waste your time here make sure that you don't go back at the same you can hallelujah hallelujah so this person realized that I would have been the one to die but this L has died for it has died in my St hallelujah hallelujah there he was offering this L's death for his death the died in his the man done it with sincity with deepness of his heart finally over over it went over and over it kept going until finally it became a tradition the Commandment of God became to addition to the people he come down let see this is so and so today maybe I better go down I better a bar is here then he says now we don't want to take communion like that these people got used to this they took it as if a tradition this evening I'm telling you is not a tradition God's ordinance are obligated to observe as Christians blessed be the name of so in other words I'm saying You must love taking the Ro's communion and enjoy it my Hallelujah I don't want take communion like that the same thing has become to the table we don't need to get used to it and take it as mere as a as a tradition but we should understand this evening I want you to understand why you have come back this afternoon you must understand why you have to take the Lord supper you should should be part of you you should be proud of it you must know even the value that you get when you take communion hallelujah hallelujah you must know hallelujah hallelujah the prophet says the ifs I wanted to tell you in the morning there are things I wanted to tell you in the morning can mention them now in the message 24th October 1954 just for quick quotation I'm starting from par6 says if the Bible told not the baptism of the Holy Ghost and way back I would teach the same thing which the Bible teaches Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and [Music] for if the Miracles seed with the apostles I believe it but God said these signs will follow them to them to we follow them that believe to the end of the world and the says I believe it whatever we do if was not in the Bible was not done we wouldn't do it why would we waste our time hallelujah hallelujah but what we believe is what the Bible say and what we believe is enough to take us to Heaven whatever we are doing we are preparing for our future home Hallelujah Hallelujah parag 158 if they say people could only speak with tongues back in the apostolic age and said that that was only the age they would speak it I would believe it but he said these signs these signs and speaking in Tong was it was in it and PR on to the end of the wow I'm coming down what baptism in Jesus's name was to seed with the apostles and in the Catholic Church form the Father the Son and the Hool which was supposed to back there and start with this I would do the same thing but it is told and it is the same the gospel must be preached the world for the witness and then the end should come if sprinkling if sprinkling was in the Bible I sprink I'm showing you what we believe what we follow and why we follow he says if Bap if there was trity in the Bible I would believe it if there was people in the Bible who were sprinkled how was it done in the Bible it was done by Jesus Christ and that's how we should do it blessed be the name of the Lord he continues and says if feet washing was not in the Bible I wouldn't preach it but the Bible say happy are you if you know these things and do them Hallelujah that's why I'm saying you must know them why you are doing them and blessed are you after knowing them and you do them rejecting them is Judgment for yourself hallelujah hallelujah so here I'm encouraging you we must do all the ordin all the word that say how done we have to do it Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord paragraph 161 if the Lord supper was spiritual and was not to be taken naturally I would say but Jesus said do this and take these articles of his body until he returns again so who am I not to do it who am I to undermine it very important my brother my sister hallelujah hallelujah if we said Divine Healing he seed back there I believe but Jesus said they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover until the end of the world I believe it do you believe it so I believe in SS following the Believers I stand up and see a lot of fanaticism rise up and act like that and more can make fun like this whatever we are doing we are doing according to the word of God was commanded to be done it is a m for you and me to do it so Hallelujah who am I not to do it the prophet says I believe it is in the Bible and because was done so hallelujah hallelujah then he says 164 I don't care then you can present the truth to them and you say here it is that says the Lord man looks at that he's not afraid of it and he walks away and say oh I don't believe it you have sined against the holy ghostess you don't believe take the word of God as it is you don't offend your pastor but you offend the Holy Ghost because it was written by the Holy Ghost you done something that you never be forgiven for you come make that thing right hallelujah hallelujah bless the so let us know what we are doing let's Embrace and love salvation which we have and whatever we are putting right before the such ordinances I for us to do blessed be the of the Lord as they were and here this quotation continues I wish I would finish it let me finish it up there's something very important down here it says 166 if I come as far as oh River and there is a bridge and they tell me there is a bridge to go across please follow these words uhhuh it is not there bless be the name of the Lord there's something very crucial for you and if I come as far as River just assume there's a river there like like river river here and there is a bridge and they tell me there is a bridge to go across home then I said well I'm going to take my automobile some other way there is a bridge you just said there is another Bridge there it was put there there is a to to pay I have got cross the bridge if I expect to get Toon I have to pass I have to cross the bridge is that right so I say I want do it I would just go buy some boat I go across on some boat I would hire someone listen there a Frank on that bridge when you get down at the other the authorities will meet you right there and arrest you for doing that that's exactly right listen to this if they were pay whoever crosses River toay you have for you you DOD and say I will pass the other side you will find there the police they will arrest you and still charge you what does that teach you no wonder Jesus said a man came in without the wedding gar on he said friend what are you doing here who brought you in here and the man stood heless why didn't he you that story he called A Wedding the parable Jesus gave a parable he invited people everybody that was to come to the wedding there was someone to wash his feet and give a gar to a wedding G then after they sat the wedding came someone who did not have the wedding friend how did you come here we had no words what am I trying to say if we don't F follow all the protocols all the righteous all the ordinances all the word of God like today you can say I'm not taking communion what's wrong with I mean what what about it it's okay you can go home it's okay next time you can still Doge time is coming because as we are here we are being dressed dressed be the of we are given the the wedding gments time will come and the video will be pred and you will be found wanting friend you have no whatever we are doing here we are preparing for that time head brother sister every you cross this flesh we have a lot to do when we are in this flesh we must live the life of Jesus Christ must do all that he commanded us to do so that even when we live this flesh where we go we are safe so we are not doing anything for any other purpose that we do we are preparing ourselves for that day blessed be the name of the Lord so you must ensure that you be there blessed be the name of the Lord apost Paul says when a day like this now we are in First Corinthians a very common scripture which every communion is read but we have to read it again and it will never be exhausted never will it be exhausted never will it be exhausted my brother my sister blessed the name of the Lord let it never be exhausted in your never be common to you let it be part of your life you the scripture read to you he supposed to be part of you that's why we say Amen that is mine be the name of the Lord so here AP PA gives us the of communion and the meaning of it he says I said it in the morning I have received of the Lord that I'm now first 11 I believe everyone knows that scripture uh from verse 23 Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you apost Paul is telling us of course we know he says my preaching my teaching my Revelation I was not given by any man I did not go in any Bible courage to given of the clear he saying what I was given of the Lord I fully give you don't you receive it why shouldn't we receive it knowing that is from the PA says follow me as I follow Christ he says when I came to you I never wanted to know anything or to see anything Jesus Christ who was crucified be SE in you and only that that is a center of our Union the Lord so he says what I received of the Lord I also give to you that the Lord the same day the same night he was betrayed took bread it was night not morning Hallelujah he took bread when it was night and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remance of me verse 24 [Music] hallelujah hallelujah not pleasing the pastor not a tradition we do it in remance of the Lord you know Catholics believe the eist that that bre they say that is the B of Jesus Christ that is real Jesus Christ exaggerate even this bread we are going to eat was made by a human being just just bread just just whe and water nothing special but Spirit it represents the body of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ said if you don't eat my body Dr my bre no so you must take it also just spiritually knowing that I'm eating the bless the it represents the body of Jesus but this is his commandment blessed the canot even be they with from the old to the New Testament during our Lord Jesus Christ he said we should do that exactly like that until he will come be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah he continues and says verse 25 after this man also he took the cup when he had Saed saying this cup is the New Testament in my bread this do you as often as you drink it in remance of me Hallelujah huj spoke it in Luke chapter 22 in Mark 14 it is all saying the same then he continues and says as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord till he come brother sister we have to eat it often as possible the apostles I think every day they were eating every day just wanting to continue remembering the Wonder that's why they called them Christians they saw their they were like Christ there Shadow a sick person could pass there Hallelujah the Jesus Christ this is what I can give you what I have is what I give you in the name of Jesus Christ and they were in the Pres of the Lord so we have to eat it as often as we can then he continues and cautions us these our usual cautions that whereever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord and shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord are we together s but man examine so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup as I said in the morning an individual examination you know yourself much better than anyone on this Earth please be sincere to yourself and put yourself right with the Lord and prepare yourself confess your sins you know that you don't need the preacher tell you them so examine your and put yourself right and reconcile with your lord Jes hallelujah hallelujah you have to do it yourself nobody will do it for you for that eats and drinks and eats and drinks damnation to himself not the's body for this are weak and sick among you and asleep I can give you another testimony the prophet gives us a certain testimony of boys who prayed with the with the communion their parents were like we are here at church here they went at the hotel us also take our communion here they yeah this is they knew how the pastor was doing it so they also we are now doing our communion I think you know very well what happened within few days they were blessed be the name of you Church know very well and people know very well very well they they did the the P us and and everything then they took the Lord supper Theon in that very particular church was living in adulter and that very very morning he went woman house and they C him somehow almost catching him he survived anded they asked him but when the church had it you just wonder surely these words you have heard we thought we have all repented and put ourselves right there someone who is even a minister who is even a minister he does such a thing but my brother my sister if I can tell you the fa of that brother his wife divorced him she got married somewh else there like VAB there and that was not even enough after that war against his Pastor when they were trying toct him the war against the P my brother my sister is nowhere after the Lord supper this is really serious and real we must really enter it with sincerity bless the name of the Lord if you find that you have things put right there just how they see you are eating your own death you must be clean in order to take of it Testament we have seen you had to be circumcised in order to take of the Passover so even today you must have examined yourself that truly you are worthy taking it was say cheing our lives surprise to every one of us you and me not only you the congregation but even us the ministers we have to check ourselves blessed be the name of the Lord and see if we are worth of taking blessed be the name of the Lord because the prophet says there is that there is little things that we do and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our fults is I'm cting in perfect strengths by Perfect weakness he says let me continue are we together Breen and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our fults is evening like this you check yourself where your fault is and the things that we might better ourselves by where you need to improve where you need to be lifted then you observe it a day like this then you live here when you are fully persuaded that let Come What May I am just ready for the Lord hallelujah hallelujah if we come to church for any other objectiv and this I am afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our [Music] weaknesses check your prayer life Che your word life how much you stud you read the word of God sh yourself my brother my sister are you strong say be strong in the Lord the of his you not weak but thou strong weak but strong can make me strong me to be stronger today Hallelujah so check your weaknesses find your bad Pres and how little you are and put our trust in somebody that is strong we know that one who is strong is here for you for he wants us just to C ourselves to him to hide our in him here to us hallelujah hallelujah me up [Music] by [Music] face [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet says I'm going to call some few quotations here then as I almost Closs he says for truly I think that is the duty of every Christian take the duty not of Christians Listen we say we are Christians if you are a Christian it's your duty take are we together s the Bible said if you take this note you have no party with me and I believe that it is a showdown time for Christians if we do not take it we have no party with him and if we take it and then we are guilty of the body and the death of Christ it's aown you to check yourself but you should first know your respons you have your duty to take it if you are not ready to take it today why because you should know if I don't take it I have no part in here but what is this that is cutting me from him why do you want it Holden on you why don't you cut it off and remain with blessed it's better for you to cut it off and with Jesus CHR so it's a showdown was on M when today we want to see those who have a true God God be your God be the true one let him answer with fire let us upon fire and we know who succeeded hallelujah hallelujah so he says the prophet says so it gets to a place where keeps the Christian prayed up you must continue the prayer life hallelujah hallelujah when he comes to communion we should come rently R meaning showing great respect and admiration so we should come meaning really like in a very serious way very serious very sincere and Ministry is a very important and and and with great respect very important thing you are coming and you are respecting it reent with full respect so walk up as you are going to walk up here confessing all of our wrongs which we are going to do that we have to do this evening pray one for the other this one I want to remind you in advance when we come to washing sweet washing when you are washing your sister sister don't forget to pray for her just as she's watching you you be praying for her she has a lot of bur you say Lord I want this sister I want to enter with her inory has weaknesses take them away from her my sister here sheing my remember Jesus when he was washing their was too

have to pray for one another service brother my sister we shall pray for one another this is our commandment this is what the word of God commands us to do we should remember those who are not here the Apostle Paul says where we did not finish that when we are to eat the Lord's Supper we have to wait for one another waiting for one another it is just to remember one another and if you know a brother the prophet tells us that you know that he's in the f go to him and tell him his help him so that at next communion should be able to join you iness now if you dodge this communion here are you sure be on the other communion which our Jesus Christ he's prepared for us I have a communion there whatever we are doing here is a continuation of what we shall find Hallelujah hallu we are doing what we shall find Beyond there so we are just in the continuation so in this moment my brother my sister remember to pray for your brother remember pray for your sister don't pray for yourself for you have enough time to repent and that time is there but this time of f worship you have to pray for your brother you have to pray for your sister say Lord help my brother him my Lord don't forget

have to be burdened of such peoplee to see them that they will be able to walk up and take communion not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters hallelujah hallelujah they our brothers and sisters like this we should remember them Hallelujah theet continues and says the mess the church he says brother it runs a whole more than walking up to the Altar and taking communion looking back and sit down on your seat it means assing Out means out like Jesus told the other rich man everything you have give the money to the poor come take your cross and follow me so today is a night of setting up everything set up everything so that you can save your soul this night it's dying out you have to die out of certain things than getting an old fashion backs a sin killing religion that doesn't white wash but washes you white cleans you up and burs out all the all the orders out stes you and makes you a new the says amen communion like this you must live here a new person having really reunited with the Lord Jesus Christ you repented of all your sin you've eat taken the bread you have taken the you are really you feel you are really in the depth of it you

whatever comes your way you are more than a conqueror Hallelujah because of the Lord Jesus Christ not by your might not by your power by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are we together oh my time is just rushing Hallelujah so as the Pastor said we need to get time to repent confess our fults and the prophet says talking about that the message that before we approach this sacred moment this is not an moment not a US moment we are entering a moment can someone say Amen as if I'm the only one who sees that as a moment he says you ask God to search my life hallelujah hallelujah this is what we are going into now ask the Lord to sech your life and if you have done anything that is not right I repeat if you have done anything that is not right say it's very simple say Lord forgive me hallelujah hallelujah forgive me for it you continue saying I don't mean to do it I make it right if you reveal it to me that's when you come together that's why me one for another let's wait on one another and let's pray for one another we want to take this communion if we don't do it we have no part so we have to put our life right we have to put our life right we must put our life right so that we take it in the right way hallelujah hallelujah we must take it in the right way BL be the name of the Lord then as we are checking ourselves BL be the name of the Lord let's continue with this quotation where he says every Christian has must take communion dy I want to jump a little bit it was misunderstood what it was Sinners and Men lying in sin come and take the [Music] communion was misunderstood a man living with a mother Foster mother and the church had told him about it but still taking communion at the table that's why that's why when we are taking communion deons who know every Christian have to be very if you know a brother has some issues are saving him if you call him outside and ask him brother have you put right blessed the name this time of repenting if you know brother has an issue which you aware brother brother this is a sweet moment where we want the spirit of the to over not even sing so if you know anything about quickly call him outside and tell him about it and see if he can put it right can clear your heart so that's why I'm saying have to watch carefully someone who is not really worthy what I'm saying you have been handling his case and he has been stubborn and night like this you see him wanting take communion to take that's why the prophet is saying it was misunderstood people taking it any you understand blessed be the name of the Lord then he continues and says another thing they give it to people that drink that that you find even someone does not even pay TI and he wants to take communion you are here you don't pay TI you are you are not even a you are a Rob and you say you take communion this is not a joking matter bless the of let us be serious just as to the church far being far be it if a man ever takes it when we are eating this he's breathing and drinking dation to himself blessed this is the moment we are entering check our lives check ourselves we are right with the hallelujah hallelujah stand fre come forward and I told you just say Lord forgive me blessed be the of Lord Psalms 131 you read there say search me that let's read that verse 131s 139 uh verse I think 23 or 21 there let's read that scripture it will help us as we approaching now time of checking our lives and let us drink sincerely everyone do it sincerely blessed be the name of the Lord as we go to the communions 139 verse 23 search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts 23 1393 and see if there be any wicked way in me and me in the way of [Music]

coming to the end of our service uh I can see the table is already well set so we are aware the pastor announced after eating and taking the [Music] wine then we shall be washing one another's feet as it was done we read it in John Chapter 13 the things we give you and read for our [Music] reminder so that you should not think we just do things anyhow remind you that was done so I must do it likewise amen so after we have done this as the pastor we shall wash one another's feet and as I said praying for one another sincere prayers then we shall be uh dismissing one another he says we shall be going at our own time so this is how it was done Jesus himself washes the disciples feet after they had eaten The Bread and Wine joh verse and the supper being ended the devil having now put the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him [Music] verse four he raised from saer and laid aside his garments and took a tow and guarded himself water into the Basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the to where he was so for the sake of time you will continue reading at your own time but this is what we are going to do immed Med after taking after finishing the table after eating the bread and blessed be the name of the Lord yeah so uh before we go to the bread I saw have I also have a a wonderful prayer which I want to pray and which also I want you to follow the words there in no very very powerful words uh which the prophet said pertaining what we are going to do he says these little pel that is made without L seasoning and so forth we which represent the body of the Lord is not round it's broke in all pieces okay this bread will be broken in small pieces uh it's because that it means his broken body that was broken for us and may God grant His blessings everyone are you hearing the prophet is praying for you that this broken bread you are going to eat it represents the body of Jesus Christ and he says may you receive all the blessings that God promised you now it is not the body it is not this this bread is not the body it only represents the body I have no no one else does to make it but bread bread so go and that's what he told us to eat this bread and to drink this cup of wine now the prophet says let us now our head listen to the prayer which he prayed for the and this is what I'm praying just follow the prayer he says most holy God servant whose servants we are in the name of Jesus Christ sanctify this bread for its intended use us as we receive it this bread is going to do something in your life if you understand the real meaning of it we remember that our Lord was crucified and his body precious and holy as it was it was mingled with stripes and Stones ands for us that through his R Body the spirit that gives us eternal life we have haveing gra as Israel did 40 years in [Music] the this as we pray you sanctify this bread this bread for the Bible says and when he had given thanks break and say it take it this is my body which is broken for you do hallelujah hallelujah so likewise this is what we have to do I'm going to break it and give you you will know what you be eating you understand what you are going to eat hallelujah hallelujah if you eat it sincerely you receive the request of your prayers hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why don't I pray for the wi well Hallelujah
