[59:14] going to our last session here at church
[59:18] I just want to take about 30 minutes
[59:24] I'm requesting we stand on our feet
[59:28] and we go to our Bibles
[59:31] and then we read in Genesis chapter 2.
[59:36] and then Verse 18 to verse 24 a
[59:39] candidates
[59:41] the first marriage that was done
[59:45] the Bible says
[59:49] and the Lord said it's not good that the
[59:51] man should be alone I will make him a
[59:54] help meet for him
[1:00:04] and then we can jump to verse 21.
[1:00:09] and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep
[1:00:12] fall upon Adam and he slept and took one
[1:00:16] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:00:18] instead of
[1:00:22] um
[1:00:28] which the Lord God had taken from man
[1:00:31] maybe a woman and brought her unto the
[1:00:34] man and Adam said this is now born of my
[1:00:37] bones and Flesh of My Flesh he shall be
[1:00:40] called a woman because she was taken out
[1:00:42] of a man therefore shall a man leave his
[1:00:45] father and his mother and shall cleave
[1:00:48] at his wife flesho
[1:00:56] foreign
[1:01:12] amen God blessing of this world
[1:01:15] let us pray fast god so keep survey
[1:01:18] father we thank you for your love grace
[1:01:20] and mercy
[1:01:22] thank you for the marriage of our
[1:01:24] brother Dana and Grace
[1:01:27] and as we go to this word of
[1:01:29] exhortations
[1:01:31] come and speak to our hearts
[1:01:35] Jesus
[1:01:39] in the name of the Lord
[1:01:43] amen you may be seated
[1:01:46] foreign praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:49] just briefly
[1:01:51] I know time is not enough
[1:01:54] I want to preach on the marriage made by
[1:01:58] God
[1:02:00] the marriage made by God
[1:02:03] forever
[1:02:09] you can make your own marriage
[1:02:12] any person can make their own marriage
[1:02:16] but we are interested
[1:02:19] the marriage made by God
[1:02:23] praise her name and so here we've seen
[1:02:26] in Genesis
[1:02:29] first marriage
[1:02:31] was made by God and in a marriage
[1:02:37] should also be made by God and we
[1:02:40] believe here tonight that the marriage
[1:02:43] of Dan and Grace
[1:02:45] has also being made by God
[1:03:18] said it is not good for a man to be
[1:03:21] alone
[1:03:23] so God realize
[1:03:26] he created man as a single individual
[1:03:30] but then the other animals the birds he
[1:03:34] met them
[1:03:39] when it came to mind he made only one
[1:03:42] and then man was on us and then God said
[1:03:47] not good for man to be alone
[1:03:50] but you see the loneliness that God is
[1:03:53] talking about
[1:03:54] you it's not meaning that Adam was
[1:03:57] literally alone in the garden
[1:04:00] there were animals
[1:04:05] God was also there so God is not talking
[1:04:09] about that loneliness
[1:04:11] is talking about the loneliness of
[1:04:14] identity
[1:04:19] and so yeah then we find that in
[1:04:21] marriage if your marriage is made by God
[1:04:25] you identify what is like
[1:04:30] that's why when Adam the Bible says God
[1:04:34] brought animals
[1:04:36] and
[1:04:38] God was asking Adam what is this then
[1:04:42] Adam saw the animal jumping and say that
[1:04:45] one is
[1:05:21] that people are finding comforting
[1:05:24] animals
[1:05:28] you know like some people don't want
[1:05:30] produce children
[1:05:32] they would rather have dolls or have
[1:05:34] cats or dogs and things like that
[1:05:36] conditions
[1:06:24] and you give to the dogs
[1:06:28] God cannot get the right person
[1:06:31] a precious person
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:38] so if you want to get a right husband
[1:06:41] ask yourself are you right before God
[1:06:45] if you want to get away right
[1:06:48] ask yourself are you right before God
[1:06:51] because the Bible says they shall
[1:06:55] deceived
[1:06:57] and they will also be deceived
[1:07:00] so if for you are pretending to be right
[1:07:04] before God you will be deceived to get
[1:07:09] the wrong person
[1:07:10] and when you're in your house you start
[1:07:13] wondering how did I come to this one
[1:07:16] again how did they get you okay
[1:07:19] so you need to be right with God first
[1:07:24] so now when Adam when God made
[1:07:27] foreign
[1:07:47] [Music]
[1:08:13] foreign
[1:08:37] now you mean you are taking somebody to
[1:08:39] keep on morning in your house
[1:09:03] only God
[1:09:05] has the best now the next thing
[1:09:09] like I was listening the testimony of
[1:09:11] Dan when
[1:09:13] done and then he was saying
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] and then Grace also was giving a
[1:09:19] testament to somebody else
[1:09:22] and then now what happened
[1:09:24] Grace was asking done
[1:09:28] who gave you my contact
[1:09:30] number
[1:09:34] and now Grace had the mystery Grace
[1:09:45] then he said this is the right person
[1:09:47] why right it all started from the
[1:09:51] shepherd
[1:09:52] to guide but people don't want to bring
[1:09:56] in their pastors when they are starting
[1:09:58] the issues of relationships
[1:10:02] they want to just get maybe at school
[1:10:06] or at places
[1:10:16] oh this one I went and visited the other
[1:10:19] relatives
[1:10:27] the source is only in the Lord
[1:10:31] praise the name of Allah now let us look
[1:10:34] at the weakness of man
[1:10:37] in first summer chapter
[1:10:42] 16. first Samuel chapter 16. foreign
[1:10:53] desire to get a king
[1:10:57] and so God told Prophet somewhere
[1:11:01] go to the house of Jesus
[1:11:08] chapter 16 verse
[1:11:11] and the Lord said unto somewhere
[1:11:14] how long will you mourn for soul
[1:11:19] objected him from reigning over Israel
[1:11:25] fill thine horn with oil
[1:11:30] and I will send it to Jesse
[1:11:34] for I have provided me a king among his
[1:11:38] sons
[1:11:45] it was only one son
[1:11:48] that God had the chosen to be the king
[1:11:52] and now this is also the Dilemma
[1:11:56] where the young people find themselves
[1:12:00] you you believe the message
[1:12:03] I'm not meant to marry from people who
[1:12:06] don't believe the message
[1:12:08] and that is right but if you're not
[1:12:11] married it's not that every sister or
[1:12:14] brother you find in the message
[1:12:19] foreign
[1:13:00] and he said peacefully that you're going
[1:13:03] to come to sacrifice unto the Lord
[1:13:09] sanctify your sins I will come with me
[1:13:12] to sacrifice
[1:13:17] and his sons and called them to the
[1:13:19] sacrifice
[1:13:23] and it came to pass when they were calm
[1:13:27] that he looked on earlier
[1:13:32] the Lord foreign
[1:14:42] you know
[1:15:21] not on his continent
[1:15:24] foreign
[1:15:58] how are you going to make a choice
[1:16:00] that means you have to depend upon God
[1:16:04] to lead you to the right person
[1:16:08] and I believe my brother
[1:16:11] praise the name of us you went beyond
[1:16:15] what you see
[1:16:17] the name of Allah and then you went to
[1:16:19] the hearts because if your heart are not
[1:16:23] neat together
[1:16:26] you'll fail in your marriage
[1:16:30] God looks at the heart and even our
[1:16:33] choice for a married person should be
[1:16:37] looking at the heart
[1:16:39] but in the Bible says you know the heart
[1:16:42] is so deceptive
[1:16:47] you need the Lord to guide you to the
[1:16:49] right person
[1:16:52] so the firstborn came God rejected the
[1:16:56] second Point God rejected
[1:17:02] and then someone was wondering all the
[1:17:05] sons
[1:17:20] he was forming a wife for Adam
[1:17:24] allow God to bring the right person for
[1:17:27] you
[1:17:28] and when the Lord brings the right
[1:17:30] person
[1:17:31] it's the Lord that will make that
[1:17:34] marriage
[1:17:36] and I believe we are witnessing such a
[1:17:39] marriage
[1:17:40] that the Lord himself
[1:17:44] God does not look what this teacher God
[1:17:48] looks at the heart praise the name of
[1:17:50] Allah now in the book of hospitals I try
[1:17:53] to finish
[1:17:56] the name of Allah
[1:18:04] the Bible says
[1:18:06] in verse one
[1:18:08] likewise your wives be in some objection
[1:18:11] to your own husbands that if any obey
[1:18:13] not the word they also mean without the
[1:18:16] word be warned by the conversation of
[1:18:19] the wives
[1:18:28] while they behold your chest
[1:18:30] conversation coupled with fear
[1:18:33] Bible
[1:18:38] who's adorning let it not be the outward
[1:18:42] dawning of plating of the hair and of
[1:18:44] wearing of gold or putting on of April
[1:18:48] um
[1:18:56] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:18:58] heart in that which is not corruptible
[1:19:02] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[1:19:05] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:19:08] great price
[1:19:20] God desires character
[1:19:24] so when you are choosing a wife for
[1:19:26] marriage
[1:19:28] choose character
[1:19:32] the Bible says when the outside women
[1:19:36] look at the behavior of the wives
[1:19:42] then they are converted to Christ
[1:19:45] they desired the life of the person they
[1:19:48] are living
[1:19:50] like in the neighborhood you're going to
[1:19:53] live you need to display the character
[1:19:55] of Jesus
[1:19:59] they display the character of Jesus
[1:20:04] that one is a great price
[1:20:10] when when Abraham Ibrahim wanted the
[1:20:13] wife for his son Isaac
[1:20:16] in Genesis chapter 24 we're not going to
[1:20:19] read this
[1:20:21] you see that eliences when he went to
[1:20:25] the world
[1:20:26] and he prayed to the Lord
[1:20:29] Praise so now our marriage
[1:21:29] water for all your animals
[1:21:32] so
[1:21:53] and Elias I chose character yes
[1:21:57] in the Book of Esther when the king of
[1:22:01] Australia's desired a wife
[1:22:03] we also chose characters
[1:22:07] so the marriage that is made of God is a
[1:22:12] marriage that is standing on the
[1:22:14] character of Jesus Christ
[1:22:17] and so my brother Dan and sister Grace
[1:22:20] should stand on the characters
[1:22:26] don't cease being good
[1:22:29] don't cease fear in the Lord
[1:22:32] stand on the word of God
[1:22:35] stand on the character of Jesus Christ
[1:22:40] look what the nature of Jesus Christ
[1:22:43] what does the word of God desire and so
[1:22:47] you should stand on that same way
[1:22:53] we go back to First Peter chapter 3.
[1:22:56] and then verse 7 as I finish
[1:23:00] likewise
[1:23:02] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:23:12] and as being here as together of the
[1:23:15] grace of Life
[1:23:17] prayers foreign
[1:24:09] you need to bless your neighbors you
[1:24:12] need to bless your colleagues and desire
[1:24:15] good foreign
[1:24:44] foreign
[1:26:44] um foreign
[1:26:49] foreign
[1:27:41] and you know these places
[1:27:45] the moment any problem happens to you
[1:27:48] they start looking immediately for
[1:27:50] somebody free bless you but yeah but at
[1:27:53] the end of the day any problem you go
[1:27:55] through every time it is your family
[1:27:57] that suffers
[1:27:59] so you shouldn't forget your family for
[1:28:02] your work don't forget your family your
[1:28:06] friends don't forget your family
[1:28:10] your family is part of you
[1:28:13] should always learn to stand there with
[1:28:15] your family
[1:28:19] we need to live in a marriage that's
[1:28:21] made by God
[1:28:23] amen amen let us finish with Matthew
[1:28:26] chapter 19.
[1:28:29] Matthew chapter 19
[1:28:32] praise the name of Allah
[1:28:36] and then verse three a Canadian Cooks
[1:28:39] the first is also came unto him tempting
[1:28:41] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[1:28:43] him
[1:28:45] mzy forever because foreign
[1:29:08] and sent for this course shall a man
[1:29:10] live father and mother and shall cleave
[1:29:12] to his wife and they trying shall be one
[1:29:15] flesh
[1:29:22] um
[1:29:23] wherefore they are no more trying but
[1:29:26] one flesh what they are for God has
[1:29:29] joined together let no man put asunder
[1:29:35] um
[1:29:40] so it's not money joining you
[1:29:44] that is God joining
[1:29:47] don't allow circumstances
[1:29:51] don't allow Financial issues
[1:29:55] don't allow any kind of issue coming
[1:29:58] between you
[1:29:59] again
[1:30:01] but let God bind you together
[1:30:06] the Bible says they are no longer too
[1:30:13] respect for one another love foreign
[1:30:23] foreign
[1:30:50] [Applause]
