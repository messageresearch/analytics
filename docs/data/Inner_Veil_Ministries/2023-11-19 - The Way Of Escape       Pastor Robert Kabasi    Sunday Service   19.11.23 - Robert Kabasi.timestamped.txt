[39:59] amen I was his best
[40:04] man you know to be a best man is
[40:06] something so great
[40:10] best it's not a big
[40:14] thing so God bless you dear
[40:17] brother amen I want to invite you to the
[40:20] word of
[40:22] God in the book of First Corinthians
[40:24] chapter 10
[40:28] we are reading only two
[40:30] verses verse
[40:32] 12 and verse
[40:35] 13 amen
[40:39] amen the word
[40:42] says says wherefore let him that think
[40:46] he standeth take it lest he
[40:53] fall amen you have to think about how
[40:57] you
[41:00] are am I
[41:02] standing and if you know you are
[41:04] standing says You must take
[41:08] heat you
[41:10] fall said there has no temptation taken
[41:13] you but such as is common to
[41:19] man but God is
[41:22] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[41:25] tempted above that you are
[41:29] able but will with the Temptation also
[41:34] make a way to
[41:39] escape that you may be able to Bear
[41:44] it amen says but with the Temptation
[41:50] also he says make a way to
[41:55] escape that you may be able to Bear
[41:58] it father in the name of the Lord
[42:01] Jesus we have read your
[42:04] word and anybody can read
[42:07] it but it takes the Holy Spirit to give
[42:11] us the
[42:12] context Lord Jesus I want to get out of
[42:16] the way that you have your perfect way
[42:20] and speak un to us in the name of the
[42:23] Lord Jesus
[42:24] Christ amen amen amen we may get
[42:30] seated so this
[42:32] morning the Lord put on my
[42:35] heart share on the way of
[42:39] Escape amen it says but will with the
[42:43] Temptation also make our way to
[42:48] escape so we want to look at a way of
[42:54] escaping he has given us a
[42:56] warning says if you know that you are
[43:00] standing then you must take he how you
[43:03] are
[43:05] standing because it's only the man who
[43:07] is
[43:08] standing who can
[43:10] fall amen it's a man who is
[43:14] upright that can go
[43:17] wrong so if you know you in your
[43:20] heart that you are standing you must be
[43:24] careful why
[43:26] the next verse tells us Temptations are
[43:30] coming and when this temptation is
[43:33] comeing they are so strong they test
[43:36] your
[43:38] life and many times when temptation is
[43:41] come people fall away but is is telling
[43:46] us that there's no temptation that is
[43:49] going to happen to
[43:50] you that has never happened to any man
[43:54] so when it happens look back the prophet
[43:58] tells us if a if there's something
[44:01] that's happening in your
[44:02] life and you don't understand
[44:05] why and how go back into the Bible ask
[44:10] the Lord has there ever been somebody
[44:14] who has gone through what I'm going
[44:15] through if there is how did they
[44:18] overcome it then Lord God if they were
[44:22] able to overcome you are the same God
[44:25] give me the grace that you gave so and
[44:28] so so that I can be able to overcome
[44:31] because there is no trial there is no
[44:33] temptation that's happening today that
[44:36] has never happened the Bible tells us
[44:39] that what is has ever been and will
[44:42] always be it is you and me who are new
[44:47] but the world the things we see they
[44:50] have ever been here is that amen the
[44:53] people have ever been here have ever
[44:56] been here houses have ever been here
[44:59] rich people have ever been here young
[45:02] people have ever been here people have
[45:04] ever been here you are not the first one
[45:07] amen so when you come here ask of the
[45:11] Lord show me how the younger people in
[45:14] the Bible were able to overcome show me
[45:18] how the old people we able to overcome
[45:21] show me how the people who are sick we
[45:24] are able to overcome there is no
[45:26] temptation there is nothing in new but
[45:29] what is has ever been and is going to be
[45:33] the tell you go away there will be some
[45:37] people who will come here and preach the
[45:40] gospel that amen so what is has ever
[45:44] been people ever sat in the church like
[45:48] the you sitting chch together so if any
[45:52] Temptation Comes Your
[45:54] Way amen it's nothing
[45:57] strange it has ever happened and some
[46:00] people have have
[46:02] overcome is that amen if it is in the
[46:06] fire the Bible tells us some through the
[46:10] fire amen some through the FL some had
[46:15] trials some Through The Valleys so
[46:18] wherever you are there's nothing in
[46:21] you amen God has promised in every
[46:27] Temptation you are not
[46:29] tempted above what you are able to
[46:34] carry is that Amen in every trial it may
[46:38] look like you are totally turned
[46:41] down but I want tell you you are more
[46:44] than able to bear that
[46:47] trial why God
[46:50] himself is the one who has allowed it
[46:53] and he will make a way
[46:56] is that amen he will provide a way so
[47:00] that you are able to
[47:02] overcome amen God will make a way where
[47:06] there seem to be no way God makes a way
[47:10] where there seem to be no way said amen
[47:14] is not the god of
[47:15] yesterday is the god of yesterday the
[47:19] god of to the god of
[47:22] tomorrow he is the ever presentent help
[47:25] in the time of
[47:28] trouble he makes a way is that amen God
[47:34] doesn't do things
[47:37] haaz doesn't do things
[47:41] haaz amen whatever he does he has got a
[47:46] purpose he has got a reason is that amen
[47:51] why is not taken an
[47:54] aware it is you and me who are Mor who
[48:00] are taken
[48:02] unaware for God before anything happens
[48:07] he already knows and because he knows he
[48:11] provides a way is that amen he already
[48:15] even set a way before you get into your
[48:18] Temptation before you get into your
[48:21] trial God has already made a way of how
[48:24] you are going to escape
[48:27] is that amen Escape is to
[48:31] flee is that amen the B says flee amen
[48:36] The Works of the devil to escape is to
[48:41] get out of somebody who has put you into
[48:44] captivity amen the enemy always
[48:48] captivates us he takes you
[48:51] captive the B say God will provide way
[48:56] of escape from somebody who has taken a
[49:00] hold of you to escape is run away from
[49:05] danger amen but sometimes you look
[49:10] around and there's no way you can be
[49:12] able to get
[49:13] out it looks like there is a river
[49:16] before you there is a mountain before
[49:19] you the enemy surrounding you and when
[49:23] you look around there is no way
[49:27] you as a human being you come to an
[49:31] end say God
[49:34] himself he will make a
[49:39] way amen why he doesn't
[49:50] allow
[49:52] together he doesn't allow anything to
[49:54] happen upon us
[49:57] just
[49:58] any I quot now making a
[50:02] way I don't believe that God ever run
[50:05] his office justly
[50:10] way I wouldn't run my mine you wouldn't
[50:13] run
[50:16] yours Jesus didn't die at
[50:19] Calvary just to say well now maybe
[50:23] people will feel sorry for me
[50:27] being that I come go to the Earth and
[50:29] take on the form of
[50:32] Flesh and they really get
[50:35] saved maybe if they see how pitiful I
[50:40] die amen Jesus didn't come so that
[50:44] people can be
[50:46] him oh sorry how they beating him it's
[50:51] not just taking sides with
[50:54] him amen
[50:56] you feel sorry for
[50:58] Jesus sometimes in the The Passion of
[51:02] Christ when you look at that film called
[51:04] The Passion of
[51:06] Christ people cry people shed tears when
[51:11] they Jesus is being be but after that
[51:15] they go back and they do anything else
[51:18] so he didn't die for that so that people
[51:21] can sympathize with him no he died for a
[51:26] reason whether people don't sympathize
[51:28] with him whether they don't P him
[51:32] whether they laugh at him he must
[51:34] achieve
[51:35] something is that amen and what he
[51:38] achieved is you and me he died for a
[51:43] purpose together so that he can make a
[51:47] way one of us for you who was once
[51:52] burned by
[51:53] traditions for you
[51:56] was once burned by sin so that he can
[51:59] provide a way before you came here God
[52:04] himself had already prepared a way of
[52:07] Escape so that you can be able to
[52:10] overcome amen God himself had prepared
[52:14] the word so that you can be able to
[52:17] overcome he will always make a way
[52:20] church we together do you love him amen
[52:25] amen
[52:25] he doesn't run his work up
[52:28] hazly God didn't do that Jesus died for
[52:32] one purpose that was to save those who
[52:35] God for
[52:37] knew would be saved that's right God
[52:41] knew there was going to be somebody
[52:44] sa and there had to be a
[52:47] preparation or made for them to be saved
[52:51] if there wasn't salvation wasn't
[52:54] possible
[52:55] so God for knowing that people would be
[53:00] saved knowing who they were you had to
[53:03] lay a plan down now you would say to me
[53:08] brother then God knows exactly who will
[53:11] be
[53:13] saved hey
[53:15] correctly why why does he say is not
[53:20] willing should
[53:22] perish he isn't he isn't willing that
[53:26] any should perish but that all might
[53:28] come to repentance but the order to be
[53:32] in but the order to be
[53:34] God he has to know who will do
[53:38] that he wasn't God
[53:46] because
[53:49] isent he's
[53:50] omnicient he knows he knows
[53:54] everything he is at every place and all
[53:59] powerful so for
[54:01] knowledge looks back say
[54:04] that
[54:06] this he know that that's the reason he
[54:09] could
[54:10] tell what the end was from the
[54:14] beginning and therefore KN that all
[54:17] these marvelous days that we are living
[54:18] in
[54:19] now stand and witness and see the things
[54:22] that we have we SE we see now
[54:26] had to make a
[54:29] preparation is that amen God knew we
[54:33] would be here God knew the days we would
[54:37] be here the time would be here he knew
[54:41] the battles we would fight he knew the
[54:44] Temptations we would go
[54:46] through is that amen he knew the
[54:49] challenges and because of that he made a
[54:54] way prepared our way such that when we
[54:58] come there is a way how we can be able
[55:02] to
[55:03] overcome how would we be
[55:05] saved in such an hour when there is
[55:09] television when there are phones when
[55:12] there are naked people on the street how
[55:15] we be saved you had to make a
[55:18] way was that way he says in those days I
[55:23] send you elah the prophet before the
[55:27] coming of the Lord he
[55:31] prepare the way of the Lord God has to
[55:34] find people here a church without
[55:38] SP he had to make a
[55:40] way prepare the
[55:43] way a person to preach the gospel back
[55:47] to the Bible the Bible so that we can
[55:51] hear and believe that we can
[55:57] escap is that amen how could we have
[56:01] escaped we would have gone like the rest
[56:03] of the
[56:04] people but he made way is that amen
[56:09] church together there may seem like
[56:11] there's
[56:12] nothing you how is
[56:15] it but God has made
[56:18] way where the gospel can be
[56:21] preached with all the churches
[56:23] around
[56:25] and lose
[56:27] preaching and is a
[56:30] preaching how would you be able to
[56:33] overcome how would you be able to listen
[56:36] the true
[56:37] word God had to make a way for the
[56:40] church to be here in ginger so that
[56:43] those people who were to escape can come
[56:48] somewhere they can hear the word of God
[56:51] they can worship God in spirit and in
[56:54] truth
[56:56] God makes a
[56:57] way is that amen do you love the
[57:02] Lord God even guides those
[57:06] people amen if they have to escape there
[57:11] way he will guide
[57:12] them in Psalm
[57:17] 3723 24 said the
[57:20] steps of a good man are ordered by
[57:25] Lord and He Delight in his
[57:29] way is that amen your steps they are LED
[57:35] they are
[57:36] ordered is that amen God doesn't request
[57:40] you God ERS you your feet were ordered
[57:46] by the Lord himself God this way and you
[57:50] had to go this way you wanted to go this
[57:53] way
[57:56] of a good man ordered by the
[57:59] Lord he makes a way where there seem to
[58:05] be ordering your
[58:09] feet is that
[58:11] amen by Nature you would have gone
[58:14] somewhere
[58:16] else is that amen but God Made A Way and
[58:21] when he makes a way he orders the feet

[59:00] us if you are standing be careful so
[59:04] that you don't fall but the B saying
[59:07] even if you fall is that amen the Lord
[59:12] will lift you up is that amen when you

[59:59] temptation that will take you
[1:00:02] away is that amen there's no trial that

[1:00:07] away why there is no temptation that has
[1:00:11] ever happened that God has not overcome
[1:00:15] is that amen there is no Christian that
[1:00:19] has never been tempted is that amen they
[1:00:22] are tempted by the overcome

[1:00:55] are being ordered of the Lord though he
[1:00:58] falls he says he shall not be utterly
[1:01:02] cast
[1:01:03] down is that amen he doesn't fall
[1:01:07] whereby they say he has fallen until his
[1:01:11] head s
[1:01:13] down no you know when people wrest they
[1:01:17] always throw one down and they want to
[1:01:20] make sure that even the head is down
[1:01:24] saying when a Christian Falls he is not
[1:01:28] utterly cast

[1:02:03] strength so that you can see there is a
[1:02:06] way of
[1:02:08] Escape is that amen when you are
[1:02:11] bound like a Samson when you are
[1:02:15] shaved like a Samson when your eyes are
[1:02:18] taken
[1:02:19] out like a Samson when the enemies
[1:02:22] rejoicing like the Philistines
[1:02:25] God has got a way amen of how his
[1:02:32] people amen now Jesus when he was here
[1:02:36] on Earth he didn't just go about all
[1:02:41] her he had one thing to
[1:02:44] do uh he said that was the will of God
[1:02:48] who sent
[1:02:50] him and everywhere he went everything he
[1:02:54] done had a meaning he had a purpose he
[1:02:58] had a plan a for ordained plan of
[1:03:02] God everything he did and if we be the
[1:03:06] children of God our life is in the hands
[1:03:09] of God who orders our
[1:03:13] footsteps and the footsteps of the
[1:03:17] righteous Jesus never went places or did
[1:03:20] things unless it had a
[1:03:23] meaning
[1:03:27] is that amen and if we are children of

[1:03:58] us he wants take us to
[1:04:01] heaven and whatever it
[1:04:04] is his plan will never
[1:04:08] fail amen why the Bible tells us when he
[1:04:14] came he didn't come just saying oh maybe
[1:04:17] so and so maybe this one maybe this
[1:04:20] one is that amen the Bible tells us when
[1:04:24] he came he came
[1:04:28] specifically to those who were
[1:04:32] his second Timothy 2 verse
[1:04:38] 19 is that amen
[1:04:42] nevertheless the foundation of
[1:04:45] God
[1:04:48] stand having the
[1:04:51] seal the Lord knowe them that are
[1:04:56] he amen and let everyone that nameth the
[1:05:00] name of Christ depart from
[1:05:06] iniquity is that amen are you hearing
[1:05:10] that the foundation of God is
[1:05:16] sure he knows them that are
[1:05:19] his when he came he says my
[1:05:23] sheep hear my
[1:05:26] voice he knows them that are
[1:05:29] his and he makes a way of how they can
[1:05:33] be able to
[1:05:34] overcome when he says let everyone that
[1:05:38] nameth the name of Christ beart from
[1:05:42] iniquity it's a
[1:05:45] command and the word of
[1:05:47] God vo is that amen when he says
[1:05:53] beart is not forcing you
[1:05:55] just that word
[1:05:58] depart it has got power that comes down
[1:06:03] and makes you
[1:06:04] depart is that amen when he says You
[1:06:08] must be born again he's not telling you
[1:06:11] to try to make yourself like you are
[1:06:14] born again word of God has power if you
[1:06:19] receive it transform you to be born

[1:09:02] Benjamin is that amen and Joseph he said
[1:09:07] what can I
[1:09:09] do these people don't understand
[1:09:13] me I know they are
[1:09:15] guilty but there is something I can do
[1:09:19] because I not the feet of the
[1:09:21] righteous they ordered of the Lord God
[1:09:24] has brought them here how can they catch
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:27] Revelation so he told one of his of his
[1:09:31] servants says get my
[1:09:34] cup is that amen and take it and put it
[1:09:39] in the
[1:09:40] B of the

[1:09:47] the cup without the people
[1:09:50] knowing and they were
[1:09:52] loed and they give them their food to go
[1:09:56] back so as they are going back the very
[1:10:00] man who put the cup he sent

[1:23:30] born some of us
[1:23:35] are that
[1:23:36] amen so that we need to be
[1:23:41] boiled and maybe 200
[1:23:46] de before we can
[1:23:51] melt some people's
[1:23:54] nature which is

[1:24:04] never is that
[1:24:05] amen some of them say even if you put
[1:24:09] them in a Mot you cannot pound them and
[1:24:12] they get you know
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:19] crushed
[1:24:21] they and don't know why they are hard
[1:24:24] but they are like

[1:24:29] determined whether you are softy whether
[1:24:32] you are hard whether you are brutal
[1:24:35] whether you are elastic you must ConEd
[1:24:39] to the image of

[1:24:58] be changed you will be changed you must
[1:25:02] be changed God is detered to change you
[1:25:05] and confirm you the image of his
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:12] son do you love the Lord
[1:25:15] amen that he might be the first born
[1:25:18] among
[1:25:20] manyen more did
[1:25:23] predestinate them he also called and
[1:25:27] whom he called them also he
[1:25:30] justified and whom he justified them
[1:25:33] also he
[1:25:34] glorified who God himself is the one who
[1:25:40] justifies God himself is the one who
[1:25:44] sanctifies God himself is the one who
[1:25:50] glorifies church out together
[1:25:54] you cannot justify
[1:25:57] another is that amen
[1:26:01] justification is an act of
[1:26:06] God human beings we can
[1:26:10] forgive but we cannot
[1:26:13] justify is that amen when somebody comes
[1:26:17] here and
[1:26:19] repent we forgive
[1:26:23] but we don't
[1:26:25] forget is that amen we always
[1:26:29] remember why you are still having the
[1:26:31] five
[1:26:32] senses memory is still
[1:26:35] alive if I do something to
[1:26:39] him and I say forgive me he will say
[1:26:42] forgiven
[1:26:44] you but then he will not
[1:26:49] forget that amen but
[1:26:52] God he
[1:26:55] justifies and
[1:26:57] justification is as if you never did
[1:27:01] it so what happens when you do something
[1:27:05] and you say God forgive
[1:27:07] me God forgives you and forgets and
[1:27:13] takes it away and throws it
[1:27:16] away forgetful so you are justified in
[1:27:20] the presence of God
[1:27:22] you never did it is that amen before man
[1:27:27] you did it you are forgiven but they
[1:27:30] have not forgotten but God forgives and
[1:27:35] forget amen so he's the one who
[1:27:39] justifies
[1:27:41] you is the one who can say this is a
[1:27:45] perfect
[1:27:47] man the one who can tell
[1:27:50] Abraham Abraham walk before me and be
[1:27:54] perfect it is God who can say that
[1:27:58] Abraham never stagged the promises of
[1:28:03] but you and me
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:11] Abraham he
[1:28:14] St I think if God would say
[1:28:17] that before sah and says my
[1:28:23] who never
[1:28:24] sted my
[1:28:32] promises this one he never St when he
[1:28:36] gave
[1:28:46] me who went with haer and I'm the one
[1:28:49] who even even rescued him from
[1:28:56] had
[1:28:58] hisory is that amen but your recording
[1:29:02] before God when you confess it is done
[1:29:06] away done behold you are a new
[1:29:12] creature in Christ Jesus all the
[1:29:18] things that am do you love the Lord
[1:29:22] amen
[1:29:24] amen we as human beings we are called to
[1:29:29] God and we must know whom we have
[1:29:32] believed Brothers why we come in the
[1:29:35] presence of God is remind ourselves of
[1:29:39] who God is and who we are before
[1:29:44] him is that amen who are we before
[1:29:50] him if we are his
[1:29:52] Tes we must
[1:29:55] know there's a song which says but I
[1:29:59] know whom I have
[1:30:01] believ and I am
[1:30:05] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[1:30:09] which have committed unto
[1:30:11] him it's good for us to know that our
[1:30:15] God is a living God it's good for us to
[1:30:19] know that Jesus Christ
[1:30:22] is the love of God expressed to
[1:30:24] us is that amen I have been thinking
[1:30:28] about this amen that the Aly
[1:30:32] God is so great that heed
[1:30:36] himself and put himself in a
[1:30:43] body for what for you and
[1:30:48] me so when we talk about Jesus Christ
[1:30:51] talking about
[1:30:54] God and we must be
[1:30:57] convinced and know that Jesus Christ the
[1:31:01] expression of the love of God for
[1:31:06] us now
[1:31:10] church God is so
[1:31:13] great that I can say it's like a l of
[1:31:17] Victoria
[1:31:20] here the ocean of the
[1:31:26] earth condensing
[1:31:30] themselves and they fit in
[1:31:37] this is that
[1:31:41] possible that's what God
[1:31:44] did the
[1:31:47] whole the
[1:31:50] Earth on the Earth
[1:31:53] they were
[1:31:55] cond like
[1:31:59] this and people were able to
[1:32:02] hold the great God and John says we so
[1:32:09] we
[1:32:10] handled the word
[1:32:12] of that he say all all the
[1:32:16] fullness of the
[1:32:18] godhead bu into this body
[1:32:22] all the
[1:32:23] ocean all the lake of Victoria cond
[1:32:28] itself God
[1:32:32] condescended that amen until we were
[1:32:35] able to handle
[1:32:37] him
[1:32:40] water but in
[1:32:42] reality that was all the ocean
[1:32:45] there
[1:32:47] the the rivers Jesus Christ
[1:32:52] God who created the heavens who created
[1:32:55] the Earth who created
[1:32:58] everything condescended himself he
[1:33:02] condescended himself and fitted in a
[1:33:05] human body and on the
[1:33:08] earth
[1:33:10] the he was looking for
[1:33:13] somebody like you and the of
[1:33:20] God
[1:33:22] it brought him it made him to
[1:33:27] condescend Hebrews 116
[1:33:30] says it say but without without
[1:33:35] faith it is impossible to
[1:33:38] please he that come to
[1:33:41] God must
[1:33:43] believe that he
[1:33:46] is when you come to God you must believe
[1:33:52] that God is and is a
[1:33:55] rewarder them that dently seek
[1:34:00] after is that amen if you think God is
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:05] a is that amen like some people they
[1:34:10] think God is a
[1:34:15] good you I received God because I got a
[1:34:20] good
[1:34:22] God is not a
[1:34:24] good God
[1:34:26] is a
[1:34:28] reality is that amen God is
[1:34:32] real and when you come and you believe
[1:34:37] may God LIF me and you know whom we have
[1:34:42] believed and to be
[1:34:44] persuaded that he is able when I came to
[1:34:48] him and I gave him my life
[1:34:52] I surrendered to him he is able to lift
[1:34:56] up that life from the death and bring it
[1:35:00] back again he more than able to change
[1:35:04] my condition from sickness back to life
[1:35:09] because God the great God was able to
[1:35:14] himself and come in a body he was able
[1:35:18] the great ocean to fit a bottle like a
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:26] that's the God we
[1:35:28] ser and don't do things
[1:35:33] supposedly come to him and know that he
[1:35:37] is and a
[1:35:40] reward is that amen what he has promised
[1:35:44] he will fulfill it it is his
[1:35:48] word hold upon it
[1:35:52] like the way you
[1:35:57] holdt that amen when they give you land
[1:36:01] title and it has been
[1:36:04] sealed it has been
[1:36:07] stamped together you are you are sure
[1:36:12] that you have the
[1:36:14] land you have the
[1:36:17] land is that amen as you walk with the
[1:36:20] land title
[1:36:22] with a
[1:36:28] square is a square mile when they take
[1:36:31] away the land
[1:36:33] title taking away your land when they
[1:36:36] take away the word
[1:36:37] of from your heart they have taken away
[1:36:41] God from
[1:36:49] you because you know
[1:36:52] who gave you the land
[1:36:54] title you know the
[1:36:56] authority you can present that Land
[1:36:59] Title to
[1:37:02] cour and you say because I have this I
[1:37:06] own the
[1:37:08] land can you imagine that but what are
[1:37:12] you
[1:37:13] having a paper what makes you believe
[1:37:17] it a seal and the authority if God has
[1:37:22] spoken you can hold his
[1:37:26] word are we together you can even go to
[1:37:29] him and say God and you the one who gave
[1:37:33] me this
[1:37:35] land why are you denying Your Land
[1:37:41] Title you can go to the
[1:37:46] agent of God and present the land
[1:37:50] title and say according to the word of
[1:37:54] God this is
[1:37:56] mine is that amen you can go the
[1:37:59] angel you can go to the people and you
[1:38:03] claim what belongs unto you you can go
[1:38:07] the pastor and say Pastor I want you to
[1:38:10] pray for me and lay hands upon
[1:38:15] me he will say why according to the word
[1:38:19] of God God told
[1:38:22] if I am sick I must go the elders and
[1:38:26] hands upon it is my
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:31] right is that the pastor May Wonder but
[1:38:36] he must devil lay hands upon
[1:38:40] you there is a higher
[1:38:43] authority which commands him God has
[1:38:47] made a
[1:38:49] way his word
[1:38:51] is the way to getto
[1:38:56] him do you love the
[1:38:59] Lord
[1:39:01] and and they just don't and they just
[1:39:04] don't do things
[1:39:07] supposedly some of them does but there
[1:39:10] are some real true worshippers of of
[1:39:13] those
[1:39:14] things for instance I tell you stories
[1:39:17] of how those devils in those Idols
[1:39:19] perform all kinds of things
[1:39:25] make blood come out of
[1:39:28] things and everything else they are
[1:39:32] devils and if you don't
[1:39:35] believe there's really a
[1:39:37] devil you don't believe there is
[1:39:40] God is that amen some people when they
[1:39:45] come to God or they come to Christ they
[1:39:48] think the devil is bad
[1:39:54] thought no the devil is
[1:39:59] real just as God is
[1:40:05] real it's not a bad
[1:40:08] thought a bad thought is just part of
[1:40:11] that is that amen but the devil is
[1:40:15] real he manifest
[1:40:18] himself and when we come to God you must
[1:40:21] know God is
[1:40:22] real and the devil is
[1:40:24] real either for God or for
[1:40:31] Satan some people come and they say you
[1:40:34] know you people are just being
[1:40:38] brainwashed now they telling you some
[1:40:41] theories God is not a theory God is a
[1:40:45] reality if you come to him you must
[1:40:49] believe that he is is and
[1:40:53] award of seek after
[1:40:57] him he respects his
[1:41:01] word he respects his
[1:41:04] word amen you hear this I'm continuing
[1:41:10] now it says sure you have to believe you
[1:41:14] have go to believe the contrary the pro
[1:41:18] and the cor so there is a real
[1:41:22] devil and he is a
[1:41:24] person not a thought he is a
[1:41:29] person now there is a teaching goes on
[1:41:31] that
[1:41:32] says the devil is just an evil thought
[1:41:35] you
[1:41:37] get no no it isn't the Devil is a
[1:41:43] person the same people that the Holy
[1:41:47] Ghost is just a good thought you get but
[1:41:51] don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:41:55] person it's the person of Christ in the
[1:41:58] in a
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] spirit
[1:42:05] together you know sometimes people end
[1:42:07] up they say the Devil is a
[1:42:11] bad but the Devil is a
[1:42:14] reality is that amen he can stage
[1:42:19] accidents
[1:42:21] that's not a bad
[1:42:23] thought it's a reality can
[1:42:26] happen he can
[1:42:29] steal he can
[1:42:32] kill he can commit adultery he can cause
[1:42:36] all
[1:42:37] evil and you see it's the devil and the
[1:42:44] SC is that
[1:42:46] amen you know uh the Bible talks about
[1:42:49] those of you have not known the depth of
[1:42:54] Satan that amen you just see the the
[1:42:58] outside of it but there are people who
[1:43:00] have fellowship with the
[1:43:05] Devil is that
[1:43:07] amen there are people who have gone into
[1:43:10] deeper things with the
[1:43:15] devil church
[1:43:17] together and there are people who have
[1:43:20] deep fellowship with
[1:43:23] God reality with God God speaking unto
[1:43:28] you God working in your
[1:43:30] life God is Not executing things in your
[1:43:35] life you know that is
[1:43:38] go speaking unto you guiding you
[1:43:43] fighting the
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:47] battle do you love the Lord so he that
[1:43:51] I'm talking
[1:43:52] about makes a way where there seem to
[1:43:57] be amen now I think that being that we
[1:44:01] see out from our
[1:44:05] congregation that life is so
[1:44:10] fragile then that death is so
[1:44:15] positive we need to come to a place that
[1:44:18] we are positive sure
[1:44:21] this that we speak of is
[1:44:25] right is that amen knowing that life is
[1:44:31] fragile
[1:44:34] fragile
[1:44:35] break is that amen knowing that the life
[1:44:39] the people I'm talking
[1:44:41] to our lives are
[1:44:44] fragile together and yet before us there
[1:44:47] is death which is
[1:44:49] real
[1:44:52] we must be
[1:44:54] positive of what we are talking
[1:44:56] about we must be
[1:44:59] sure is that amen that's why the Bible
[1:45:02] says that come to
[1:45:04] God must really know that
[1:45:09] is if we have come to this
[1:45:12] message the B says prove all
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:18] things the B says make your calling and
[1:45:21] election
[1:45:24] sure don't guess
[1:45:26] around this is not another good
[1:45:30] religion this is the word of
[1:45:32] God for the
[1:45:37] hour Church Upon
[1:45:40] This we are able to cross over
[1:45:45] Jordan is that amen we have to look in
[1:45:48] the of death
[1:45:51] and
[1:45:53] say where is
[1:45:56] your why I know who I have
[1:46:00] believed is that amen we a to stand in a
[1:46:04] situation and call upon God and tell the
[1:46:08] devil tell every offer I am not ready to
[1:46:12] give in because I know what I am holding
[1:46:18] I cannot exchange it
[1:46:20] something temporal I know whom I have
[1:46:23] believed I know what I have believed I
[1:46:27] know the messenger I know the message I
[1:46:30] know the God who sent and I am sure God
[1:46:34] Is
[1:46:37] foundation God knows those who are but
[1:46:41] do we know who our God
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:48] is is that amen we always
[1:46:52] forget but he's a real
[1:46:55] God is that amen he's
[1:46:58] real it's not a good
[1:47:01] doctr sometimes people are fighting who
[1:47:04] has got the best
[1:47:05] doctr brother when death
[1:47:08] comes you don't need a good
[1:47:11] doct you need a
[1:47:13] reality you need God and when we
[1:47:16] ministers come here we always have to
[1:47:19] search ourselves
[1:47:21] church I always wonder when I'm going to
[1:47:24] preach I said what am I going to
[1:47:27] preach from one person 100 people must
[1:47:31] be
[1:47:32] listening and each one must have
[1:47:34] something to
[1:47:35] get must be dead
[1:47:39] honest is that amen I must get out of
[1:47:42] the way so that God can come why I have
[1:47:47] to
[1:47:49] answer
[1:47:51] amen is that amen I should not give them
[1:47:54] the
[1:47:55] promises I should not just exite the
[1:47:58] people I must introduce
[1:48:01] them God
[1:48:05] himself and when we come to God we must
[1:48:08] have that reality is that amen when we
[1:48:11] pray pray really when you are talking to
[1:48:15] God because he has got the word is
[1:48:17] behind
[1:48:18] it is that amen you don't have faith
[1:48:23] because of somebody you have faith
[1:48:26] because of the word is that amen there
[1:48:29] is a
[1:48:31] foundation there's something upon which
[1:48:33] I can
[1:48:36] stand is that amen like I'm saying you
[1:48:39] are going to
[1:48:41] cour you have got a title and you know
[1:48:45] the other person has
[1:48:49] faked has
[1:48:51] soldiers maybe has a lot of
[1:48:53] witnesses but for you all you have is a
[1:48:57] land title is that amen you are sure of
[1:49:03] this and you you can die for
[1:49:06] it before they take it away you tell
[1:49:10] them kill
[1:49:13] me is that amen let no
[1:49:18] nobody take away the hope you have
[1:49:21] which is the word of
[1:49:23] God is that amen do you love the Lord we
[1:49:28] must be
[1:49:29] positive amen the prophet says now the
[1:49:33] the one reason that I am a calvinistic
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] thinker of security of the believer is
[1:49:41] because I believe that when a man or
[1:49:43] woman is in their right
[1:49:47] mind that is the time to accept the Lord
[1:49:51] Jesus and get it all settled
[1:49:55] then once
[1:49:57] forever that amen theistic
[1:50:01] thinking together is the thinking of
[1:50:06] Grace but the thing of Grace is that
[1:50:09] when you are
[1:50:11] okay come to Christ when you are so
[1:50:17] bad is that amen come to Christ with
[1:50:21] real
[1:50:23] understanding not by
[1:50:27] emotions is that amen come to God and
[1:50:31] say I know whom I have
[1:50:34] believed I've given him my life I've
[1:50:38] given him my
[1:50:39] soul I am not I'm
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] not I'm not
[1:50:47] mad is that amen now you what the
[1:50:50] prophet continues to
[1:50:52] say it
[1:50:55] says says because when we come to the
[1:50:59] end of the
[1:51:00] road we don't know just where and how we
[1:51:03] are going to be to be
[1:51:05] sick we may we may be sick in our
[1:51:09] mind there might be a fever that would
[1:51:11] really cook our very
[1:51:16] brain and we might say anything or do
[1:51:19] anything at the end of the
[1:51:22] RO we don't know but you see if we have
[1:51:26] already Anchored In Christ no matter
[1:51:29] what sickness takes us or what condition
[1:51:33] we are when we go it's already
[1:51:37] settled we are
[1:51:39] sealed until the day of our
[1:51:43] Redemption amen Ephesians
[1:51:47] 4:3 the holy spirit of God whereby you
[1:51:50] are
[1:51:51] seal until the day not of your death but
[1:51:56] of your
[1:51:57] Redemption see after death is done over
[1:52:01] you are still
[1:52:03] sealed is that amen when we come come
[1:52:10] so when we surrender surrender
[1:52:14] so because you don't know what is going
[1:52:17] to happen
[1:52:18] tomorrow
[1:52:22] together you know when we
[1:52:24] believe baptism of the holy
[1:52:27] spirit is something which happens in
[1:52:32] the it's a seal which the devil cannot
[1:52:38] access which he cannot take away
[1:52:40] from chch together now in the
[1:52:44] body you can get
[1:52:47] sick and the prophet is saying a can
[1:52:51] come and cook your
[1:52:54] brain and when the brain is messed
[1:52:57] up you can say certain
[1:53:00] things that are not right but God knows
[1:53:05] them that
[1:53:06] are where is the
[1:53:08] seal in the soul you may find a
[1:53:12] Believer getting mad and speaking things
[1:53:17] that are not right even denying
[1:53:21] Jesus but when he's already born again
[1:53:25] because the new birth is inside of the
[1:53:28] Soul that's why the prophet is saying
[1:53:31] while we are okay let us make it
[1:53:35] right am you can fall sick until
[1:53:39] somebody can come on your death bed and
[1:53:42] make you confess that you a
[1:53:48] Muslim is that amen and you say I'm a
[1:53:52] Muslim is that amen but that doesn't
[1:53:55] mean you a Muslim it is the sick passion
[1:54:00] saying I'm a Muslim but the real passion
[1:54:04] inside is already born
[1:54:06] again he cannot change he F until the
[1:54:11] day of
[1:54:13] redemption amen I know whom I have
[1:54:17] believed I am persuaded have committed
[1:54:20] unto him that he will make a way at the
[1:54:24] end of The
[1:54:26] Journey do you love the Lord church are
[1:54:30] we
[1:54:35] together thank you so we want to look at
[1:54:40] how do we
[1:54:43] escape because the Bible say he has made
[1:54:45] the
[1:54:47] Escape he always make a Escape
[1:54:51] there is there's a
[1:54:53] shadow in the Old Testament of what they
[1:54:56] used to call ascape
[1:55:00] Goat amen escape goat we always use that
[1:55:05] word when people put know when people
[1:55:09] use
[1:55:10] you as an
[1:55:14] excuse you know many times people use
[1:55:16] others as an
[1:55:18] excuse have their problems they have
[1:55:21] their issues and they bring it upon
[1:55:25] you so for you you are called a scap
[1:55:30] goat a scap goat is a sin barrier a sin
[1:55:38] carrier go amen always the one which is
[1:55:44] set away from the
[1:55:47] people but when you look at the scap
[1:55:49] goat
[1:55:51] it is
[1:55:52] Innocent but they have put upon
[1:55:55] it the sins Leviticus chter
[1:56:00] 16 verse 15 16 yeah chapter 16 verse
[1:56:08] 5 it
[1:56:09] says it says and he shall take of the
[1:56:12] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:56:14] two kids of a of God of the Gods for a
[1:56:17] sin offering and one ram for
[1:56:32] and Aon shall offer his Bullock of the
[1:56:34] sin offering which is for himself and
[1:56:37] make an atonement for himself and for
[1:56:39] his
[1:56:48] house
[1:56:54] amen ver verse
[1:56:57] seven and he shall take the two goats
[1:57:01] and present them before the Lord at the
[1:57:03] door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:57:10] congregation and shall cast upon the two
[1:57:14] Gods one lot for the Lord and the other
[1:57:17] lot for the scap godat how alone
[1:57:27] Aon shall bring the goat upon which the
[1:57:31] Lord is Lord fell and offer him for a
[1:57:34] sin
[1:57:42] offering go on which the Lord fa to be
[1:57:45] the scap goat shall be presented alive
[1:57:47] before the Lord to make make an
[1:57:49] atonement with him and to let him go for
[1:57:54] escapegoat Into the
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:12] Wilderness amen so two
[1:58:15] gods were required in the Old Testament
[1:58:20] for for sin
[1:58:22] offering now one go they to cast a
[1:58:27] lot and and the lot fell on any of those
[1:58:32] goats so one
[1:58:34] goat was to be
[1:58:37] offered before the Lord it had to be
[1:58:40] killed amen and then the other the other
[1:58:45] goat which was called scap
[1:58:47] goat was not
[1:58:50] killed amen but the blood of the Dead
[1:58:54] Goat was put on this on this on the
[1:59:00] goat and then we are going to see that
[1:59:03] Aon the PRI how to lay hands upon the
[1:59:07] life
[1:59:08] God with the blood of the Dead God and
[1:59:13] then he would
[1:59:14] cry and then he would would confess and
[1:59:18] he would
[1:59:20] would bring all the
[1:59:21] sins of the people upon that God to lay
[1:59:26] hands upon it I don't know whether it
[1:59:28] took him a whole day or how long
[1:59:33] confessing adulter the
[1:59:36] fornications the theft all the evil the
[1:59:40] unbelief all the gambling everything was
[1:59:46] confessed when his hands were upon that
[1:59:50] go are you following the story let's
[1:59:53] continue and Aon shall bring the Bullock
[1:59:56] of the sin offering which is for himself
[1:59:58] and shall make an atonement for himself
[2:00:01] and for his house and shall kill the
[2:00:03] Bullock of the sin offering which is for
[2:00:18] himself
[2:00:20] amen amen Aon had also an offering for
[2:00:23] himself and for his house but we are
[2:00:26] looking at this offering for the
[2:00:31] congregation
[2:00:32] verse says and when he has made an end
[2:00:35] of reconciling the holy
[2:00:38] [Applause]
[2:00:41] place and the TAC of the
[2:00:45] congregation and the altar he shall
[2:00:48] bring the life go
[2:00:50] and Aon shall lay both of his hands upon
[2:00:53] the the head of the life
[2:00:57] godess over him all the iniquities of
[2:01:01] the children of
[2:01:03] Israel and all their
[2:01:06] transgressions and all their sins
[2:01:09] putting them upon the head of the
[2:01:11] go and he shall send him
[2:01:14] away by the hand of a f
[2:01:17] man into the
[2:01:20] wildness and the
[2:01:22] go be upon
[2:01:25] Him their
[2:01:28] iniquities a not
[2:01:32] inhabited let go the goat in the
[2:01:37] wilderness amen so that go after had
[2:01:42] confessed his
[2:01:43] sins they would get another
[2:01:46] person a clean person
[2:01:49] and they tell him to carry that goat and
[2:01:53] go with it far away in the
[2:01:57] wilderness away from the
[2:02:00] people and then he leaves it there and
[2:02:03] he runs
[2:02:05] back is that amen that is the goat which
[2:02:08] was called the scap
[2:02:09] goat it carried all the
[2:02:12] iniquities of the people and it never
[2:02:16] came back again one God
[2:02:19] was killed the second go it was let to
[2:02:23] go into the
[2:02:25] world so the people here they are now
[2:02:29] free they can worship God they can they
[2:02:32] can live in the presence
[2:02:34] of why one goat has died for them and
[2:02:39] the other goat has the away amen now
[2:02:45] that one was a tape of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:50] in the New Testament the Lord Jesus

[2:06:07] transgression and we who remain here we
[2:06:10] are remaining in the presence of God and
[2:06:13] we are Justified and we are free why the
[2:06:17] god doesn't come back again to bring the
[2:06:21] sin the go has already
[2:06:25] died our church what am I talking about
[2:06:30] let's go to
[2:06:31] Calvary is that amen are we together
[2:06:34] friends on Cal we see Jesus Christ being
[2:06:39] wounded we see Jesus Christ being
[2:06:43] denied we see Jesus Christ being brought
[2:06:46] before the the chief priest
[2:06:51] amen and when they brought him he had to
[2:06:54] die in the presence of the PRI just like
[2:06:59] the DI in the presence of
[2:07:02] the church together amen and on that day
[2:07:08] so many Sinners there was one man who
[2:07:12] was on the
[2:07:13] cross together amen when he was on the
[2:07:17] cross he looked
[2:07:19] Jesus and he said this man is innocent
[2:07:24] and another one was
[2:07:26] accusing the one who has caused us to
[2:07:29] die and one who was saying No this man
[2:07:34] is innocent we are guilty but the
[2:07:38] innocent
[2:07:39] one because of the guil Jesus looked at
[2:07:43] him and he said
[2:07:46] today together today

[2:07:55] have forgiven I am caring them I'm going
[2:08:00] with them into hell they cannot be
[2:08:05] remember that
