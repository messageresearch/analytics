[12:52] supper maybe during foot
[12:56] washing
[12:57] amen so let go to marthew chter
[13:03] 24 and then verse
[13:08] 45 Matthew chapter
[13:12] 24 verse
[13:15] 45 up to verse
[13:21] 51 so the Bible
[13:25] says who then is a faithful and and wise
[13:29] Steward whom his Lord has made ruler
[13:32] over his household to give them meat in
[13:35] due season
[14:02] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[14:04] when he cometh shall find
[14:15] so very I say unto you that he shall
[14:18] make him ruler over all his
[14:25] Goods but but and if that evil servant
[14:30] shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth
[14:33] his
[14:42] coming and shall begin to Smite his
[14:44] fellow servants and to eat and to drink
[14:47] with the
[14:57] drunken the Lord of that servant shall
[15:00] come in a day when he lookth not for him
[15:03] and in an hour that he is not aware
[15:13] of and shall cut him a s and appoint him
[15:17] his portion with the Hypocrites there
[15:20] shall be weeping and nashing of teeth
[15:38] may God bless of his word you may be
[15:41] SE so this
[15:44] afternoon I just want to more of
[15:47] continue with what we had in the
[15:50] morning but we want to focus on faithful
[15:56] service praise the name of our Lord
[15:59] faithful
[16:01] service so the lord requires us to do
[16:05] every
[16:08] service Faithfully you know being
[16:12] faithful in the things that the Lord has
[16:15] committed to
[16:16] you being faithful in the work that
[16:19] you're
[16:20] doing being faithful you know in the
[16:23] responsibilities that you're
[16:26] doing because somebody has committed to
[16:29] you what you
[16:31] have and you'll know that at the end of
[16:34] the day there will be somebody
[16:39] concerned how are these
[16:41] people praise the name of the Lord like
[16:45] let me just put it this way like when
[16:48] you
[16:48] marry you marry Somebody's
[16:51] Daughter or you get married somebody's
[16:54] son either
[16:57] side will concerned about their
[17:01] person in that
[17:04] relationship the The Father's Side the
[17:07] husband
[17:08] side they'll always want to find out how
[17:11] is their
[17:14] son and sometimes they can become
[17:20] suspicious maybe he's being
[17:23] mistreated oh my son is not being given
[17:26] enough food
[17:29] or maybe there's some
[17:31] conflict and they will always want to
[17:33] find out what's happening
[17:35] at even the other side even if you have
[17:39] stayed for 10
[17:42] years the other side wants to know how
[17:44] is our
[17:46] daughter how is our
[17:49] son because they are concerned about
[17:51] what they
[17:54] own I found my brother was annoyed the
[17:57] other day
[17:59] I found my sister is annoyed the other
[18:02] day and those who can be
[18:05] rush they can start saying you're
[18:07] mistreating my
[18:09] son you're mistreating my daughter you
[18:12] know they can just get phone calls and
[18:14] call
[18:16] you maybe they realize it is not
[18:19] so maybe later they realize it is not
[18:22] so but then the message has reached
[18:26] home don't mistreat my daughter my
[18:31] son so there is a concern on either
[18:35] side but then we are require to be
[18:40] faithful and then he says who then is a
[18:43] faithful and wise
[18:49] servant whom his Lord has made ruler
[18:52] over his
[18:54] household to give them meat in this
[18:57] season
[19:00] blessed is that
[19:01] servant whom is Lord when he
[19:05] cometh shall find so
[19:09] doing in other words in our
[19:12] services we are meant to do what is
[19:14] required of
[19:16] us what the Lord has really appointed
[19:20] you and you know when the Lord appoints
[19:23] you to do a certain
[19:25] thing do it with all your heart
[19:29] you don't do it as men
[19:33] Pleasers praise the name of our Lord you
[19:35] do everything with your
[19:38] heart and you know there's a scripture
[19:41] here which I want to read we should have
[19:45] read it in the morning but we didn't
[19:46] read
[19:48] it let us go to the Book of
[19:55] Luke Luke chapter 17
[20:00] and then we start reading
[20:07] from Luke
[20:11] 17 and then verse 7 he says but which of
[20:16] you having a servant plowing or feeding
[20:19] CLE will say unto him by and by when he
[20:22] is come from the field go and sit down
[20:26] to meet
[20:42] you know he is a servant so his
[20:45] responsibility is to serve
[20:47] you so now the whole day has been in the
[20:51] field and he's tired and now when he
[20:55] comes home you're not going to tell him
[20:58] go and sit
[21:00] down and eat when you have a respon when
[21:03] you have a service for him to
[21:06] do he says and will not rather say unto
[21:09] him make ready therewi I may sa and
[21:14] guard thyself and serve me till I have
[21:17] eaten and drunken and afterward th sh
[21:19] eat and drink
[21:34] that's what the scripture is saying says
[21:36] when he comes back much as is
[21:40] tired even if the food is in the
[21:43] kitchen and for you in the sitting room
[21:46] and then he has come from maybe
[21:49] far and then he has reached but as long
[21:52] as it's your
[21:53] Serv please serve me
[21:56] food don't say you have been here you
[21:58] mean you have not been seeing
[22:02] the no he says that is your
[22:07] responsibility then he says does he
[22:09] thank that the servant because he did
[22:11] the things that were commanded him
[22:21] verse I TR
[22:24] not so likewise ye when you have done
[22:28] all those things which are commanded you
[22:32] say we are unprofitable servants we have
[22:36] done that which was our duty to
[22:51] do amen he says say we are unprofitable
[22:56] servants in other words
[22:59] I've done that which is my
[23:01] role and even if people don't thank you
[23:05] don't appreciate for what you
[23:08] doing just be happy that you've done
[23:10] what you meant to
[23:12] do praise the name of and be content
[23:15] with that and then you know you do it
[23:18] with
[23:20] joy you know because the Bible says as
[23:24] you are doing whatever you
[23:26] doing you are doing it unto the
[23:29] Lord not doing it unto men and these are
[23:33] the things we just need to
[23:35] know that in our
[23:38] stewardship in our
[23:40] services we are serving the
[23:43] lord we are not doing it unto
[23:46] men now in Ephesians 6 and verse
[23:52] 5 he says servants be obedient to them
[23:56] that are your Masters according to the
[23:58] the flesh with fear and trembling in
[24:01] singl of your heart as unto
[24:15] Christ so he says do
[24:18] it be obedient to your
[24:22] masters with fear and
[24:26] trembling in singleness of
[24:30] heart as unto
[24:32] Christ not with eyes
[24:36] Service as many
[24:39] Pleasers but as Servants of
[24:43] Christ doing the will of God from their
[24:48] heart with Good Will doing
[24:52] Service as unto the
[24:55] Lord and not unto men
[24:59] you may have a Ser a master at your
[25:01] place of
[25:02] work and it doesn't fear
[25:05] God but still as long as you have work
[25:09] there the Bible says you need to give
[25:12] him
[25:12] respect and when he's given you
[25:15] assignment do the
[25:17] assignment as if you are doing it unto
[25:20] the
[25:21] Lord notto your
[25:23] [Music]
[25:26] master that's the scripture says so now
[25:29] in every work that we do we need to do
[25:33] it
[25:34] Faithfully faithful
[25:38] service you do it you know you do it as
[25:42] your
[25:44] best do it as if it's the only thing for
[25:47] you to
[25:48] do praise the name of our Lord you know
[25:52] like sometimes maybe if I'm a work at
[25:54] home
[25:58] there is this example here you know
[26:01] there are people who are hired to clean
[26:06] toilets now what some of these people
[26:09] do they loock some
[26:14] toilets but why are the TOs
[26:17] built they leave only one
[26:20] room and then the other three rooms are
[26:24] closed now they know that maybe at Mid
[26:26] this one will be very dirty
[26:30] so he comes and loocks the dir one and
[26:33] open another one which is
[26:35] clean then why you given that
[26:40] job you
[26:42] know they don't want to do
[26:45] work or they will give
[26:48] excuses and then some will pretend as if
[26:50] they are too busy when the work is too
[26:55] small how can you be cleaning the same
[26:57] room for one
[27:02] you know so you are not you're doing it
[27:04] with high
[27:06] service when when they are coming then
[27:09] you are
[27:11] busy now when they
[27:15] away now you know
[27:17] this when you he's
[27:21] coming and there are some people who go
[27:23] to their Gardens to
[27:26] dig they're just there the they holding
[27:29] the whole like this then they start
[27:33] conversing they went ear enough inste of
[27:42] digging now they start feeling
[27:44] we
[27:46] what
[27:51] small I'm so tired the sunshine is too
[27:53] much you feel the Sunshine because
[27:55] you're not
[27:56] working but if you are working
[27:59] you move first and then you
[28:01] leave you know so there are some with
[28:03] those kind of wrong
[28:06] attitudes and they places of work
[28:09] assignment you give them it's too much
[28:11] work too much work
[28:15] work they gave you that because actually
[28:19] you have the
[28:20] job because that work is hard but if it
[28:24] becomes easy you have lost your job
[28:28] why would they hire if the work is not
[28:32] worth why so then we need to
[28:37] appreciate the things that God has given
[28:39] us to our
[28:42] responsibility and then you do it
[28:45] diligently you do it with all your
[28:48] heart praise the name of our Lord this
[28:50] what the scripture is talking about not
[28:53] with I
[28:55] service not as men Pleasers
[28:58] but you're doing your work as if you are
[29:01] doing it to the
[29:03] Lord and that's how you can be
[29:06] blessed because you're
[29:09] recognizing that what I'm doing I'm
[29:12] serving the lord and then the scripture
[29:14] says in verse
[29:16] 8 knowing that whatsoever good thing any
[29:19] man
[29:23] does the same shall he receive of the
[29:26] Lord
[29:29] whether he be bor or
[29:32] free now he says whatever good thing you
[29:37] do sometimes you're working for a
[29:40] master and he is not happy about what
[29:43] you're but you're doing the right thing
[29:46] sometimes you're working for a master he
[29:48] doesn't appreciate you at all but the
[29:51] master in heaven should be the one to to
[29:54] be pleased most even this one when they
[29:57] don't say thank
[29:59] you do the best you can
[30:02] do and then the Bible says then of the
[30:06] Lord you will also be rewarded for what
[30:09] you have
[30:11] done whether you are
[30:13] bound or you are free in other words
[30:17] whether you are
[30:20] saved or you are
[30:22] not as long as you are doing
[30:25] work that is worth of
[30:30] worth of
[30:33] Praise of
[30:35] honor the Lord will bless you in
[30:39] that whether you in his kingdom or
[30:42] you're not in his
[30:43] kingdom that's concerning
[30:46] work he says he will give you the
[30:51] reward praise the name of our Lord like
[30:53] if you are a diligent
[30:56] farmer you are doing your work very
[31:00] diligently the Lord will bless your
[31:03] G whether you are born
[31:06] again or you not born
[31:08] again that's about work so then we need
[31:12] to be
[31:13] faithful and then we have another
[31:16] challenge that a brother or a
[31:19] sister when they get to work for a
[31:22] certain
[31:25] believer they despise that word
[31:29] they not
[31:32] [Music]
[31:36] serious why are you working there you
[31:37] working there for
[31:42] free if you know that you are being
[31:45] paid not that they can remove you and
[31:47] put another
[31:49] person and again don't say that brother
[31:51] is
[31:54] heartless you fa to do the job
[31:57] given you work open the shop by
[32:01] 7 for you are coming at
[32:04] 9 now what will he
[32:07] do and sometimes you hear
[32:10] them I give that brother work he doesn't
[32:14] want to do my
[32:16] work then the brother sometimes when
[32:18] he's out of
[32:19] work oh pray for me I
[32:23] get but when you get work you desp it
[32:28] you don't finish the work you on this
[32:32] then immediately on
[32:33] another you have not pleased the other
[32:36] one why don't you finish the other one
[32:39] thoroughly say that from what you have
[32:42] done you can now
[32:45] recomendations to get another job but
[32:48] then you on this on this half
[32:55] Hazard you losing out
[32:58] so then we need to see that we give
[33:02] honor praise the name of our Lord to the
[33:05] bosses that we
[33:08] have whether he born
[33:11] again or is not born again whether he
[33:15] understands or he doesn't
[33:18] understand like here in our country even
[33:21] here in Gia you find most of the
[33:23] companies are owned by Asians
[33:31] and you know some of them your bosses
[33:33] don't know even what to
[33:36] do he's just there putting you on
[33:38] pressure to learn from you finish finish
[33:40] finish finish finish
[33:44] finish he's busy learning from you he
[33:48] doesn't know
[33:51] your he's your boss write
[33:56] report he wants learn
[34:02] from because he your
[34:05] boss but then there are some
[34:08] others they want this one to go away
[34:11] when he comes he pretends as if he's
[34:14] doing
[34:15] something but then he's doing the wrong
[34:20] thing you know there are somewhere like
[34:23] that when he knows your me to connect
[34:25] this wire in this place
[34:28] when the boss comes tries to pretend as
[34:31] if he passes
[34:37] here and the thing fails to work when
[34:41] the says they calling
[34:43] me then he comes fixes very
[34:47] fast people are very
[34:52] chcken just just to
[34:55] pretend but the Bible is telling
[34:58] we shouldn't do as I
[35:01] service and then
[35:04] verse and you
[35:06] Masters do the same things unto
[35:10] them forbearing
[35:14] threatening if you a boss at a place of
[35:17] work why would you
[35:20] threaten why and you know some places
[35:23] God has given you a
[35:26] privilege that there are many people
[35:28] under
[35:29] you but now as a child of God be an
[35:33] example to
[35:35] them praise the name of our Lord why
[35:37] would you demand them to greet you first
[35:39] when for you when you meet
[35:42] them which is okay for them to greet you
[35:44] first but why don't you so go and say
[35:47] how are
[35:49] you but then when they are greeting you
[35:52] just busy
[35:54] walking you can't have some bit of time
[35:57] to talk
[36:00] and you can't tell the Affairs of your
[36:04] workers but you know you need to see
[36:06] that you live in a
[36:08] community with that kind of friendship
[36:11] and
[36:14] relationship maybe you have people who
[36:15] help you at
[36:17] home but you don't care how they
[36:20] sleep you don't care what they are
[36:22] eating you don't care how they
[36:25] are maybe they are really
[36:29] but you don't care I pay you my
[36:32] money you need to
[36:35] work you know there is a way you need to
[36:38] do it as you doing it to the child of
[36:44] God so he says you Masters do the same
[36:48] unto them forbearing
[36:52] threatening knowing that your master
[36:54] also in heaven
[37:00] there is neither respect of persons
[37:04] with pra the name of so you need to see
[37:07] that you are Faithfully in the
[37:11] services that the Lord has committed
[37:13] before
[37:14] you first Timothy 6 verse
[37:25] one the Bible says
[37:28] let as many servants as are under the
[37:31] Yoke Count Their Own Masters worthy of
[37:34] all honor that the name of God and his
[37:37] Doctrine be not bamed
[38:08] so he
[38:09] says if you a
[38:12] servant count your master with all
[38:19] honor give them
[38:22] respect he's your master you know there
[38:25] are some companies again
[38:28] they owned by
[38:29] families oh big rich
[38:32] people then they bring their child of
[38:35] maybe 14
[38:37] years that is your
[38:41] boss sometimes is younger than your
[38:46] children is your because you want their
[38:51] money
[38:54] here is your boss
[38:58] you know there are some scenarios in
[39:01] life which are challenging but you have
[39:04] gone to their
[39:05] place do the work
[39:07] faithfully and then he
[39:10] says and they that have believing
[39:14] Masters let them not despise them
[39:17] because they are Brethren but rather do
[39:19] to them service because they are
[39:21] faithful and beloved partakers of the
[39:24] benefit these things teach and exalt
[39:54] amen he said even when you have a master
[39:58] kind
[40:00] person don't exploit
[40:03] him don't take things don't take him for
[40:07] granted my the time I
[40:13] reach when a problem comes you may end
[40:17] up being losing that
[40:20] job that's what may happen so you need
[40:23] to be faithful serving
[40:28] do everything
[40:30] diligently they given you an
[40:32] assignment do it in time and
[40:36] deliver and you know some people don't
[40:39] know that the more you on a particular
[40:43] work is The More You Hinder more work to
[40:46] be given to
[40:48] you so you're hindering your
[40:51] progress you are hindering your
[40:54] income you are hindering your Eary
[40:58] and you know this this places of
[41:02] work sometimes it can be a place of
[41:07] opportunity to get a better job than
[41:10] what you
[41:11] have but how will you get a better
[41:14] job if you are despising what you have
[41:18] now you're not doing it
[41:21] effectively who will be attracted to
[41:23] your
[41:25] work nobody will be attracted
[41:28] there's a brother here okay we had a
[41:31] brother here and then he was working
[41:34] Ina in a certain
[41:37] Farm or company in the marketing
[41:41] section and then know he was doing work
[41:46] well and it so happened that he he
[41:48] handled some
[41:52] work with a some top manager in one of
[41:55] the big companies in the country
[42:00] and now this the way he handled this
[42:02] work of course that's how would
[42:05] do you know but now some people want to
[42:08] work for you when known you a
[42:11] big that's
[42:14] service even somebody who you think is
[42:18] nobody do the work
[42:20] well maybe you're working for example in
[42:23] public offices
[42:27] the
[42:28] government and maybe somebody has an
[42:31] issue or maybe somebody has put in a
[42:34] request handle it
[42:36] diligently as you would handle it for
[42:38] another
[42:40] person that's the attitude we need to
[42:43] have a place of work you don't say if he
[42:48] a woman I'm going to
[42:50] Del if he a man I'm going maybe to do
[42:53] this if he a child said don't come to
[42:58] you do it
[42:59] Faithfully so this brother handled the
[43:02] work and he pleased this man but he
[43:05] didn't know that this man was
[43:08] responsible so when opportunity came in
[43:11] that big
[43:13] company for a particular
[43:16] work he came back to this young and
[43:19] asked
[43:21] him can you get a job in this
[43:24] place said it's okay said okay you apply
[43:28] this is this and this and
[43:30] this so he applied and he got a very big
[43:35] job being paid I believe more than 10
[43:37] times what was earning in this
[43:40] job but how did it come because of
[43:44] serving
[43:45] Faithfully even when the job was
[43:48] small but he did it
[43:52] diligent that's what the scripture say
[43:54] if you are faithful in the little
[43:57] you'll be faithful in the
[43:59] mar now if you are failing the small
[44:02] one to do it
[44:05] diligent how are you going to be given a
[44:08] bigger
[44:09] responsibility you'll end up making the
[44:11] company
[44:14] collapse praise the name of the Lord so
[44:17] now the Bible is telling
[44:18] us let us not
[44:22] despise when our
[44:25] masters are believe
[44:28] but then we do it
[44:30] diligently we do it you know with all
[44:33] our
[44:34] heart a Believer has given you some work
[44:37] to
[44:38] do you now you can afford to delay the
[44:42] [Music]
[44:46] believer
[44:49] patience about to pay your
[44:52] money will you be patient with him
[44:58] because you're working because you want
[44:59] to
[45:11] [Music]
[45:12] earn
[45:14] diligent you know let us do the work
[45:16] with all our
[45:19] hearts What the Lord Has put before us
[45:23] praise the name of the Lord now David
[45:27] when he was a
[45:29] son he Faithfully served his
[45:33] father and the father would send him go
[45:36] and do
[45:37] this David would be on that
[45:41] business know there sometimes when you
[45:43] have children at
[45:45] home you send a
[45:47] child yeah you can't buy for me
[45:50] this instead of buying the thing is just
[45:53] with the
[45:54] friends maybe he has reached in a place
[45:58] and then there are some of these people
[46:00] who are showing some magic and things
[46:01] like
[46:03] that and then goes there stands around
[46:06] the
[46:08] people and he forgets that they have
[46:09] sent him
[46:12] anything that was not David they send
[46:15] you to do this you go and do it come
[46:20] back that was David now when he was
[46:24] given the role of being a shepherd
[46:28] he was
[46:29] faithful that when he saw the bear
[46:32] coming he didn't take off but go went
[46:36] ahead against the
[46:38] bear to save the Sheep when the lion
[46:41] came he did the same and now when David
[46:45] was a soldier under
[46:49] Soul he was
[46:52] faithful praise the name of our Lord he
[46:54] was faithful until one of the
[46:58] priests in second in first 1 Samuel
[47:02] chapter
[47:05] 22 and then verse 11 verse
[47:12] 15 then the king sent to call aich the
[47:15] priest the son of aibu and all his
[47:18] father's house the priests that were in
[47:21] no and they came all of them to the king
[47:41] and Saul said here now though son of
[47:44] aibu and he answered here am I my Lord
[47:58] and Saul said unto him why have you
[48:00] conspired against me though and the son
[48:03] of Jesse in that thou Hast given him
[48:06] bread and a sword and Hast inquired of
[48:09] God for him that he should rise against
[48:12] me to lie in weight as as this day
[48:41] then answered the king and said and who
[48:45] is so faithful among all thy servants as
[48:49] David which is the King's son-in-law and
[48:53] goeth at thy biding and is Honorable in
[48:55] thine house
[49:19] so now was giving a
[49:23] testimony that David is faithful
[49:27] in the house of
[49:29] Saul David is faithful in the Kingdom of
[49:34] Saul until Saul would persecute
[49:38] David you know in this instance
[49:41] here Saul made sure that all the seven
[49:45] priests are
[49:47] killed because of David and then he goes
[49:51] and still hunts and chases for David
[49:56] and now
[49:59] David understands that Saul is after
[50:03] him he goes and hides
[50:06] himself and when he hides himself still
[50:10] Saul keeps on looking for
[50:13] him until one day sa was tired with his
[50:17] army and they were
[50:20] sleeping and then David came to their
[50:22] camp
[50:23] [Music]
[50:27] and one of the Servants of David said
[50:29] God has given us our
[50:34] enemy and David said don't do anything
[50:39] wrong don't touch the Lord's
[50:42] anointed don't hurt
[50:45] him so
[50:47] David praise the name of our
[50:49] Lord let us go to 1 Samuel chapter 26
[51:00] and then
[51:01] verse
[51:03] one and it came to pass when Saul
[51:06] returned from following the Philistines
[51:08] that it was told him saying behold David
[51:10] is in the wilderness
[51:16] ofed 1
[51:18] chapter 24 verse1
[51:41] 1 samel CH4 vers to now then Saul took
[51:44] 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and
[51:48] went to seek David and his men upon the
[51:51] rock of the wild
[51:54] Gods continue okay
[52:20] and he came to the ship cats by the way
[52:23] where he was there was a cave and so
[52:26] went in to cover his feet and David and
[52:29] his men remained in the sights of the
[52:31] cave
[52:32] [Music]
[52:59] and the men of David said unto him
[53:02] behold the day of which the Lord has
[53:05] said unto thee behold I will deliver
[53:07] thine enemies into thy
[53:09] hand that thou shalt do to them as shall
[53:12] seem good to thee then David arose and
[53:15] cut off the scirt of Saul's Rob
[53:17] privately
[53:36] praise the name of our Lord and so
[53:40] David his heart could not allow him to
[53:43] do harm to
[53:47] Saul Saul was his
[53:50] master sa was his King and David was a
[53:55] servant so now
[53:57] David you have a king as a servant you
[54:02] are required to be
[54:05] faithful to the king in other words
[54:09] there is no harm that should come to the
[54:12] king and you know so David was convicted
[54:15] when he cut off Soul's
[54:18] garments but then he went out to show
[54:20] the
[54:21] king yeah and then show him you see what
[54:25] has happened to your Rob
[54:27] to show him that God has given you in my
[54:31] heart but I couldn't kill you I couldn't
[54:34] do any harm to
[54:36] you then sa went back again s he has
[54:39] David is and then again he
[54:43] come he was always after the life of
[54:48] David to see how he can do harm to
[54:52] David now in second 1 Samuel chapter 26
[55:00] praise the name of our Lord and then the
[55:03] scripture
[55:07] says and then verse
[55:10] five and David arose and came to the
[55:13] place where Saul had prited and David
[55:15] beheld the place where Saul lay and abna
[55:18] the son of Neil the captain of his host
[55:20] and so lay in the trench and the people
[55:23] pitched around about him
[55:47] for
[55:57] then said abish to David God has
[56:00] delivered thine enemy into thine hand
[56:02] this day now therefore let me Smite him
[56:06] I pray thee with the spear even to the
[56:09] Earth at once and I will not Smite him
[56:12] the second time
[56:34] said to abishai destroy him not for who
[56:37] can stretch forth his hand against the
[56:39] Lord's anointed and be
[56:53] Guiltless David said furthermore as the
[56:56] Lord liveth the Lord shall Smite him or
[56:59] his day shall come to die or he shall
[57:03] descend into battle
[57:16] and the Lord forbid that I should
[57:19] stretch forth my hand against the Lord's
[57:22] anointed but I pray thee take th now the
[57:26] spear that is in his bolster and the
[57:28] cruise of water and let us
[57:50] go praise the name of our Lord so then
[57:53] when David had gone with the things of
[57:55] sa
[57:57] he stood a far off and then he called
[58:01] the Servants of sa AB the
[58:04] captain why aren't you doing your job
[58:09] Faithfully there are people who came to
[58:11] the camp where the king
[58:13] is you see what he was meant the the
[58:18] bolster see where they know the water
[58:21] are they still there and then AB was
[58:24] saying don't make noise for
[58:29] to keep the
[58:30] king if wanted do they would have
[58:35] done and then you see how David now was
[58:37] telling
[58:39] abam in verse
[58:42] 14 David cried to the
[58:46] people AB the son of
[58:50] saying not
[58:53] abna then abna answered
[58:56] I said who are
[58:59] you to cry to the
[59:01] [Music]
[59:04] king but the man was
[59:06] sleeping he was sleeping on his
[59:10] job then things were becoming a
[59:13] mess then he said David said unto
[59:18] AB not a viant man and who is like thee
[59:21] in Israel wherefore then hast thou not
[59:24] kept thy Lord the King for there came
[59:27] one of the people to destroy the king
[59:29] thy
[59:47] Lord the thing you have is not good that
[59:50] you have done as the Lord liveth you are
[59:53] worthy to die because you have not kept
[59:55] your m Master the Lord is Anointed and
[59:58] now see where the king spear is and the
[1:00:00] cruise of water that was at his bolster
[1:00:27] so we need to be faithful in our
[1:00:30] service abna was not faithful in his
[1:00:32] service and then David Is Telling You
[1:00:35] Are Meant to
[1:00:36] die because you have not kept the king
[1:00:39] and now when s realized that it is
[1:00:42] David then he said oh my
[1:00:46] son and then he said why are you chasing
[1:00:49] me that was David asking
[1:00:53] him why are you chasing me from my in
[1:00:57] inance you know I've done nothing wrong
[1:01:00] to you and then David says in verse
[1:01:04] 23 the Lord render to every
[1:01:08] man his
[1:01:10] righteousness and his
[1:01:12] faithfulness for the Lord delivered you
[1:01:15] into my hand
[1:01:17] today but I will not stretch forth my
[1:01:20] hand against the Lord's anointed
[1:01:26] so David was
[1:01:28] faithful in his services that he
[1:01:31] wouldn't see want to do anything
[1:01:34] wrong to his master much as his master
[1:01:37] was
[1:01:38] against we need to do services to the
[1:01:42] Lord in
[1:01:44] faithfulness praise the name of our Lord
[1:01:46] and God has given you your
[1:01:50] responsibility God has given you your
[1:01:53] stewardship because he has counted you
[1:01:57] to be faithful that's why you given so
[1:02:00] then fulfill the trust that God has
[1:02:02] given unto
[1:02:04] you that he has committed a certain role
[1:02:07] to
[1:02:08] you he has committed a certain
[1:02:10] responsibility to
[1:02:11] you then you do it like now Paul says in
[1:02:17] first Timothy 1 verse
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] 12 1
[1:02:24] vers and I than CHR Jesus our lord who
[1:02:28] has enabled me for that he counted me
[1:02:32] faithful putting me into the
[1:02:46] ministry so when you have a
[1:02:49] ro the one who has given you that Ro the
[1:02:52] one who has committed that stewardship
[1:02:54] to you
[1:02:56] has counted you Faithful so don't
[1:02:59] disappoint the
[1:03:02] person you know don't disappoint them
[1:03:05] somebody has given you their money like
[1:03:08] the Bible says in Matthew
[1:03:11] 25 we can go there we meant to read it
[1:03:15] in the morning but we didn't have enough
[1:03:18] time Mathew chapter
[1:03:23] 25 and then verse 14
[1:03:26] for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man
[1:03:29] traveling into a far country who called
[1:03:32] his own servants and delivered unto them
[1:03:36] his
[1:03:45] Goods he says
[1:03:48] hiss and then he gave them his
[1:03:51] Goods like we looked at the morning we
[1:03:54] are not our own
[1:03:56] our own lives are the
[1:03:59] lordes even what we have is
[1:04:03] thees we are his servants and he has
[1:04:06] given us his
[1:04:09] Goods the talent that you have the gift
[1:04:12] that you have the job that you have the
[1:04:16] family that you have the work that you
[1:04:18] do it's the Lord who has given it to
[1:04:21] you so he says he gave them his Goods
[1:04:26] and one he gave five
[1:04:30] talents another
[1:04:32] two another one to every
[1:04:37] man according to his several
[1:04:42] ability and straight away he took his
[1:04:45] journey so God gives us based on our
[1:04:51] ability at that time if God has given
[1:04:55] you something
[1:04:57] be thankful that something and do it the
[1:05:00] best you
[1:05:01] can he's measuring your
[1:05:05] faithfulness now if you Faithful in the
[1:05:07] small God has given you he says I'm more
[1:05:10] than able to give you
[1:05:13] more the way God was telling
[1:05:16] David he told David if such and such
[1:05:20] were not
[1:05:22] enough I would have given you more
[1:05:26] let us go to 2 Samuel chter
[1:05:29] 12 praise the name of our Lord 2 Samuel
[1:05:33] chapter
[1:05:35] 12 and then we read in
[1:05:46] verse verse
[1:05:49] 8 and I gave thee thy Master's house and
[1:05:53] thy Master's wife into thy bosom and
[1:05:56] gave Thee the house of Israel and of
[1:05:58] Judah and if that had been too little I
[1:06:02] would have more over have given you such
[1:06:06] and such things
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:27] praise the name of the Lord is saying
[1:06:29] what I've given you if it is less is
[1:06:33] small or if you have learned how to
[1:06:35] manage it
[1:06:37] better if youve learned how to manage
[1:06:40] what have given you
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:45] better then I would give you
[1:06:49] more praise the name of our Lord say he
[1:06:52] delivered to them his Goods
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:56] one he gave five
[1:06:58] talents another two talents another one
[1:07:01] talent and he says based on their
[1:07:04] several
[1:07:07] ability and now the ability that they
[1:07:11] had would enable them to
[1:07:16] multiply their
[1:07:18] stewardship praise the name of would
[1:07:20] enable them to multiply their
[1:07:24] stewardship praise the name of let me
[1:07:26] put it this
[1:07:28] way if you can be a good
[1:07:32] Steward as a father as as a
[1:07:36] husband if you can be a good
[1:07:39] Steward as a wife you can be added
[1:07:42] another
[1:07:45] stewardship what is
[1:07:47] that as a
[1:07:50] husband I'm a faithful Steward to my
[1:07:53] wife
[1:07:55] then I can receive the stewardship of
[1:07:57] being a
[1:08:00] father that's what happens so it keeps
[1:08:03] on
[1:08:04] broadening the more you do
[1:08:07] Faithfully the more it
[1:08:09] increases the one was given five
[1:08:12] Talent was able to trade the five
[1:08:15] talents and then they became 10
[1:08:18] talents and you know the master was
[1:08:20] interested in their
[1:08:23] service until the Bible say
[1:08:26] the one who who got five talents and
[1:08:29] added more five
[1:08:31] talents see what reward was
[1:08:34] given let us go back to MTH CH
[1:08:38] 25 praise the name of our Lord MTH
[1:08:43] 25 verse
[1:08:47] 20 and so he that had received five
[1:08:50] talents came and brought other five
[1:08:52] talents saying Lord though delivered me
[1:08:55] unto me five talents behold I've gained
[1:08:58] beside them five more
[1:09:16] talents his lord said unto him well done
[1:09:22] you good and faithful servant
[1:09:26] you have been Faithful over a few
[1:09:29] things I will make you a ruler over many
[1:09:34] things enter th into the joy of thy
[1:09:39] Lord says good and
[1:09:42] faithful to the world had five
[1:09:45] Talent people were saying yeah you have
[1:09:47] too
[1:09:48] much but the master was committed to
[1:09:51] you little
[1:09:56] because he owns a
[1:09:58] lot praise the name of the Lord so we
[1:10:01] need to be
[1:10:02] faithful in all our
[1:10:05] services if God has given you anything
[1:10:08] in be faithful in that
[1:10:11] service be a faithful
[1:10:13] Steward and then you see how the Lord
[1:10:15] will expand
[1:10:17] it praise the name of our the Bible says
[1:10:21] if a man is
[1:10:23] diligent you know he will C what he
[1:10:27] has praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:10:29] it talks about
[1:10:31] parents that they even live
[1:10:34] wealth to their great
[1:10:38] grandchildren faithfulness in
[1:10:41] stewardship that's what we should do
[1:10:44] praise the name of the Lord but then you
[1:10:46] get in some
[1:10:47] places the father has had a lot of
[1:10:51] things when when the father dies and the
[1:10:54] children take over
[1:10:56] they just sell
[1:10:57] things they were not
[1:11:00] raised they were not trying to take over
[1:11:02] to manage those
[1:11:05] businesses your father has left you with
[1:11:07] 10
[1:11:08] acres but after 5 years you on a

[1:28:06] boss it's not your father's
[1:28:09] business even in your father's business
[1:28:12] he doesn't he doesn't want to take
[1:28:15] risks you know those people outside or
[1:28:19] in some places when they want their
[1:28:21] children to take over their businesses
[1:28:25] they don't put them up here they put
[1:28:27] them down here to start learning casual
[1:28:30] work if it is a farm let him learn how
[1:28:34] to make Po how to make a
[1:28:37] fence to dig a
[1:28:39] hole
[1:28:41] feet how they put this he also leave
[1:28:44] some of those
[1:28:47] things when when he's among them he
[1:28:51] knows how hard work is
[1:28:55] when it comes to going to pick
[1:28:58] animals is not there on phone hey have
[1:29:01] you brought the animals back he has to
[1:29:04] go where they are they feeding
[1:29:07] on that's
[1:29:10] tutorship that's what they were doing
[1:29:13] and you know the Bible says that a child
[1:29:16] as long as he
[1:29:19] young is not better than a
[1:29:22] servant actually the servant rules over
[1:29:25] the
[1:29:26] child like
[1:29:28] David when he was young he had a sheep
[1:29:33] keeper who was teaching him how to keep
[1:29:36] the so they would go
[1:29:39] here go chase that can't bring the other
[1:29:42] one other has given back it up here this
[1:29:45] is what they do he was under
[1:29:49] tutorship so they don't just take you to
[1:29:52] become a manager
[1:29:54] when you don't know what to
[1:29:56] manage they ask you how many gos do we
[1:30:00] have let me go to the records and find
[1:30:02] out are you really a
[1:30:05] manager how much money have you made let
[1:30:09] me check you even don't know the
[1:30:12] straight
[1:30:14] things praise the name of our Lord like
[1:30:17] sometimes I challeng the
[1:30:21] person how many lers have you made this
[1:30:23] morning
[1:30:28] if he goes in the book then you know
[1:30:31] how there's something wrong here so you
[1:30:34] must have these things at finger
[1:30:37] points to know okay my business runs
[1:30:40] like this my wife does like this like a
[1:30:43] child going to
[1:30:45] school and then they come back in the
[1:30:47] evening and then you ask him what did
[1:30:49] you learn today and then he goes and
[1:30:52] picks his books
[1:30:54] what he has learned has he really
[1:30:57] learned he was absent minded he can't
[1:31:01] tell today we learn in
[1:31:03] geography about the map of Uganda this
[1:31:06] point this point but if he's just
[1:31:08] thinking of first reading then he tells
[1:31:09] what he
[1:31:11] Lear you don't trust that so we need to
[1:31:15] be
[1:31:17] diligent be
[1:31:19] careful put all your hearts in the
[1:31:23] things that God is is putting you to
[1:31:25] do praise the name of our Lord you're
