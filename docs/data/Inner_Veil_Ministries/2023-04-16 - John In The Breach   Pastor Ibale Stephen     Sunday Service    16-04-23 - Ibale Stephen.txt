God bless you yeah we always appreciate sister winning he's in their house that's where we began this Fellowship amen amen so I always he trapped the angel yeah but he was praise with God Israel so as we come to service today you just put on your fighting spirit amen that when the angel passes your way don't let him go all day Matthew blesses that in this service you will surely take something back looking back on his life is wrong us he said thy brother came with it and he's bought the right to do he fled to her eyes and dwell there with lovers daughter [Music] the Stars he grew greater in

said I wanna let you go [Music] [Music] it's all oh my God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but on my own I keep on failing so long I'm down on my mind [Music]

need to hold him in this service until he gives you a new name amen I mean why do you die foreign [Music] shall beware perhaps I have four under the Disco [Music] and it shall be well [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to bring forth the life but in the time of life this could be your day let's stand up and get into the scripture reading Revelation chapter four father we thank you for this opportunity again these are rare moments when your children come together to have Fellowship in the world and in times like this father you give a promise that we are two or three are gathered together you'll be there and to begin with Father we remember that you gave us an open door the door of the blood of Jesus Christ of that blood we come before the masses to find mass in the time this is your children father have got so many different desires I pray that you grant them they deserve foreign he says after this I looked you know when we say after this you know the church went through Seven Ages Christ was put out of his church and he says behold I stand at the door so when they failed to happen then another Story begins and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were over trumpet talking with me and I'll show you things which must be he arrested and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was open in heaven and one sat on the throne amen may God bless you so I have got a title this morning I'm speaking on John in the bridge John in the bridge now Revelation is the revelation of Christ the foundation upon which the church would grow from Ephesus to the Capstone himself now Revelation the scripture says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave Anton John to show unto himself things which must certainly come to pass and signified it by his Angel to his servant John yeah the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto his servants so prophecy spoke of Christ in numerous way some directly like in Isaiah 7 14. [Music] directly as it was depicted in the shadows so the history also speaks of the Christ of Nazareth amen Amina you know prophecy spoke towards him but when he came observed his presence and they wrote about the reality of his presence Here and Now so we would rather say that history speaks of the Christ of Nazareth please and it's a poem that reality amen amen you know about the Christ of Nazareth who was born of a virgin died at the cross raised again on the third day that the Christian organizations are founded on that is it they found themselves on that history just like they always say let us recite the Apostles Creed they are reciting the history that Jesus came on us yes so Christian religions the reality of history is founded on the revelation of that Christ in the present time Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ but the religious Christian denomination they are just founded on the Real History of Once Upon a Time is not an historical God we serve a present tense the one that raised from the dead and has proven to be the god the God that was the neighborhood and the apostles foreign [Music] [Music] you do not go into the history books Jesus Christ Jesus Christ reveal the personally to you the door of faith that God gives you is the personal revelation of Christ to you now let's go to Matthew chapter 16. amen amen it completely disturbs the religious world of that day I was a man speaking spiritual things and yet it was so simple to understand until the scripture says that common man had him glad so you know he was so special foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] who [Music] [Music] foreign now since we've always known that you need to attract what we did but a name speaks of course the moment you get the white stone which is revelation if you've got a possible Revelation direct from above today [Music] is you sharing in the characters [Music] the kingdom of God is in here so that Revelation it holds the power of transformation once you get the Revelation to you your father has nothing to do with it your friend has nothing to do with it it is really like we saw on Easter Sunday [Music] upon which the ministry is founded the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto God [Music] so the ministry of John to the servants that's the revelation of God the revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen so my Ministry is not how long your dress should have been great it's not how long your hair should be good every day my Ministry is the revelation of Christ and once you get it just voluntarily you'll get your dress longer you get your hair growing amen I mean you are not depending on my dues but the revelation of Christ [Music] foreign in your place amen amen so God gives the Revelation to George the revelations is not the simple knowledge of Jesus being God because West explained very well that oh yes there is one God but the Revelation that John receives is greater than the understanding of the godhead because this Revelation confused with God revealing his personality together with his wife in the seven churches it goes further than God here [Music] foreign [Music] okay I'm in a so Revelation 1 4. to the seven churches which are in Asia main area mechanisms amen amen does not mean they were the only churches in Israel but John I mean to the 70 churches to represent the Journey of Christ through the Southern church they are the churches that God is addressing himself too amen amen they are some others but I'm choosing this to represent the training characteristics of the Church of Christ in the church from Pentacles [Music] John to the seven churches and peace from him Hallelujah hear the scripture says and the seven spirits which are before it's wrong now the question is does God have seven spirits John 4 24 says God is a spirit foreign [Music] praise the Lord but when he says to the seven spirits listen now you need to get to the foundation there were so many churches which way is and when John was on the island he didn't go there for a mission he has been thrown away from the community because it was transforming the lives of the People by the preaching of the Gods and the Roman Empire so they threw him on the island which was old and now that Island had so many reputations that was so poisonous to get rid of this man Amina [Music] actually they are helping you to get away from their society that happened to me amen when my family stay away from me it pushed me to his hands are you together is John the Apostle somewhere amen amen always give thanks foreign [Music] when this entire civilization is passed away then what comes next is [Music] so now when is really presenting this seventh I mean fourth verse here he says to the seven churches and these seven churches they represented the changing characteristics and again the character of the church [Music] the training characteristics whom we are calling a message at the changing of the characteristic foreign [Music] foreign amen amen to lift us again to another level as we go through the bridge and the seventh seals [Music] so now seven spirits oh each time the church was changing the holy spirit with a different way of the same holy spirit amen and they were to go and speak to the church Hallelujah in the power of the spirit again they would work again [Music] this is what they are calling seven spirits of God but yet one Spirit but manifesting in different ways he's addressing himself to the churches who was addressing the church [Music] that can be lifted from history can be pointed out in the presence with his Supernatural presence and it can still be pointed out by prophecy into the future now that is the serving revelation of Christ [Music] [Music] Christ must be revealed to you personally on the same principle he revealed himself in the seven churches you must build foreign you know as you walk double Tumblr like you are fainting the Holy Spirit comes again with a refreshing in your life and you work again there is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] because the priest foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] knowledge [Music] oh perfect charity bounce the church together what is the charity The Life of Christ [Music] when that life is not there you will always be looking for a way he's staying farther away from the church and let me tell you when these Spirits possess a person amen it keeps him in church but make sure that that person is not together with the church [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign yeah praise the Lord you see until you now Baka the seventh Church I think let's go there let's go to Revelation chapter three upset the church kept changing his characteristics amen amen Revelation chapter three okay and verse 14. this is now the last church the church is where we are foreign but in the last days the church I mean the world wow yes will go into Sodom conditions now buddy you can be in trouble very big trouble because the women they want to put on men's trousers but like in the United States foreign foreign are you together running but today they don't attribute the genders to the success so somebody was being asked so what is the woman and he says you know a woman is a agenda feeling it's a gender thing one who has to be loved one has to be this one so I I chose to be a woman to teach what I'm teaching to help you stand in the position because everything that happens out there in the world it has got its spiritual bearing here in the church now you're together with the new uneasy you look where the good is that you look out whatever you ever you see there it has got a spiritual bearing which will reflect itself let's look at this Fallen Edge Revelation chapter 3 verse 14. and to the end of the church these things says which means we've come to the end of time because you don't say men in the middle of the prayer amen comes at the end I mean so Jesus is the amenhage are you together with me run easy this thing says amen the faithful and true Witnesses but it's the reality that comes out of the Shadow because when Jesus came yesterday John called him the love of God that takes away the sin of the world so when Jesus came from he was not the plan so the person of Jesus as opposed to the lamb in the shadow [Music] [Music] because we are traveling the beginning [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah somebody says brother Stephen how does God perish by depreciating are you together with me by depressing value the other day in the states I was in a house it was built in 1860. you get into that house it's better than any other house I've been to in this country yes when they put they reserved all the Furnitures of the house the furniture everybody the birds you couldn't believe and that man died in the 80s it was George Van built something like that yeah you can't even believe so when I got in there of course they tell you the history this is where he used to welcome Royals 150 rooms in the house and I walked and I said brother I'm tired I can't go home you go up and then down all this kind of things this man dies he had a capital value of 200 million dollars foreign [Music] perish you might depreciating oh the man is now losing value that's the wealth but this church Edge is um and they say I am rich they are not preaching the god of characters the goal of characters that's where you need to be rich in the character of God but this one's here they are rich in the correct of this world which passes away foreign [Music] the code that perishes that's the standard of where the end time church is now normal to awakens services [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that actually encompasses this Edge amen I mean because they do not want even to open for Christ without Christians you know they put him out of his church in verse 20. he says it's not me anymore [Music] it is uh you know motivation to to motivate people that's what the gospel is so the seventh Church which is supposed to be the going away of the church the church on the nature and the character of worship amen the queen whom the king calls and she refused to come yeah [Music] all things continuous [Music] Don't Preach the second coming of Christ and yet while the fullest Virginians were sleeping [Music] then the bridegroom comes when the voice came behold the bridegroom they woke up try to trim the lamps they had enough oil we need to keep the oil burning we need to be reminded of the coming of the Lord church over and over again amen we do not need to go into the spirit of verses we need the spirit of Christ amen ruling from within so the spirit of Versa takes overload this year and the rejected the king's God because the king's calls is Revelation chapter four which we rare when you're not the church is being told come and display your beauty before the king the time for the raptures come foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I would rather that you are not you come out anyway you know because the Lord Vision Church dropped off from the anointing of the hour which is the anointing of the coming of the Lord servant from the original pentecostation [Music] will receive the Rapture in Grace [Music] for the change of the body amen Amina so now let's get in the subject now Revelation 4 1. amen Amina you come here to see I'm not going to be here forever so I'll do the best I can just give us what we have needed to each other amen Amina Revelation chapter four right now amen Amen brother James today is preaching for brother last weekend weekend yeah he was preaching for brother and time will be with us Revelation 4 1. now this is after Leo this year has closed and they've refused to open for Christ now Revelation chapter four after this and behold they know us open in heaven Origins whenever this door closes [Applause] when this job closes [Music] because the door had closed against Christ when we say close the description we are talking about you because you are the body of Christ you cannot have come facts thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this year [Music] [Music] they know foreign they get the people to walk a distance with them and put them in their place are you together when is it so when Lord this year close there is another door which is so we are going to understand John in the bridge if you love to get up to you know amen amen praise the Lord so now as you see now takes a distance there was another door opened in heaven while you were originally come up amen from the door and that's why brother Branham speaks about the seventh Seal saying it ends up the ushering in of the Millennium which means that after the Pentecostal Church the nomination of groups which is the work of the Asha are you together this is what we call the bridge between the seven churches you know today John is in the bridge amen praise God so this seventh seals which is the complete revelation of Christ amen he's coming and this is not an instant happening boom boom seven series [Music] foreign that's where we operate with the message of the hour and John says immediately I was in the spirit he began to see things which were going to be here I said I got in the spirits that's the first thing he was in the spirit is not John's body change foreign [Music] [Music] hey hallelujah hallelujah now the denominations have closed they don't need Christ anymore are you together with me and this Christ is going to work with you anyway it is foreign foreign foreign you know he started and they did not see the body of Flesh they saw him in this glorified State he was right there in the manifestation of the power of translation I'll go to siwa so they fell down to the feet and then all of a sudden three hearts here one obviously one foreign are you together with it and the vision went of course the same state John was in to see this is the same steps when he saw in Revelation he says I was in the spirit I did not have a body of change or body change so the state of Jones was that was in an amount of classification is the same body he has in Revelation 4. it's the same steps of being Moses to us on Mount Sinai when God was vindicating him before the peace it's the same state is not the rapture are you together with me what is it joining the bridge is not representing a church that has been glorified church that has been called out of the Fallen organization to be brought into special places [Music] we are not in the organization we are not in the body change in the bridge Hallelujah [Music] amen amen there is that spot which has been provided wow amen amen so in this language let's call it you know like people some of you travel government you have been on those planes amen you get to the airport and then you present your token from the very people who check you out to the place and they say there's nothing that stops you from traveling then you go down here in migration they look at it and they said yes you qualified amen you are not on the plane and you are not in the outside world [Music] [Music] um we are [Music] here we are in the bridge [Music] foreign amen I mean what would you Hereafter mean he wants to show you the time that all things which are going to take place that is going to take place in this waiting time in this bridge alone he shows him the Rapture what it's going to be he shows him the three and a half years he shows him the final war after the Millennium he shows him the judgments he shows him the lack of fire he shows him the New Jerusalem so now he puts him there so that he can speak to him foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there is something foreign are you together with Brothers yes we are put here today everyone to be told about the future I'll show you things that will be here so this bridge here is the gap that exists between the churches and most important is the revelation of finished work in this bridge foreign a practical revelation of redemption Redeeming the names that are in the book amen amen so this tax John beyond the physical experience for three and a half years it's more than that he's knowing him now at a greater level the same time from his own history we need to separate this Christ Church amen amen he is the person yellow amount to of the Lord himself [Music] a divine presence so when this door closes he has to be yesterday the Lord himself are you together shall descend Hallelujah in his Spirit to form before he puts in his Spirit forms before he puts on his body he first brings the presence to be the Asha okay to be the messenger to this Friday amen Amina let's go for Thessalonians chapter 4. remember there is a time we are going to wrestle with the angels amen amen reserve your strengths he says here in first Thessalonians 4 16. the Lord himself is that Elohim that existed before the Jesus body as sacrifice so the Lord himself in his Spirit shall descend from heaven with the shot with the voice of the archangels and with the Trump of God foreign are you together with me so this coming he comes as an anointed spirit he hasn't brought his body yet but he has come to guide his church in the same way that The Messengers kept guiding their Church ages the Lord himself the Saints but when he does he takes the body of malachite a prophetic Ministry of where it is it yes sir those denominations they always elect both of their prophets whose best prophecies you'll eat a potato tomorrow nothing spirited but we've got a word Prophet all right we shouldn't be proud about that you can't really give the Lord the hand of prayers amen where would we be foreign foreign they build it even Vice equally [Music] amen Ami as it was in the days there has to be a return of the son of man before the son of David which is Christ the King Texas Road amen they are hard to come again a son of man Ministry which is a prophetic Ministry to be revealed among us and that's what happens in the bridge message when the Lord himself comes as an anointing upon a prophet to teach his brother foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign something called you out of the denomination he says that these seven sealed book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God but this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger so the revelation of the sacraments alive that will refer to me rapturing Faith but in Revelation is referred to as the voice it's a life you become a speaking word um you are the voice of God in this day are you together you suck in the word and even before you speak you become a voice they look at what you do where you go yeah how you dress you become a voice you have the voice of Christ on the earthquake amen I mean yeah it's not the voice is the Life of Christ sitting in the brain as the rupturing phase and this place becomes surreal until God decided fried with it and comes into fellowship with that Faith are you together with me you get a magnet of an imaginative amen and you put some feelings here you know when you get the the the the the the magnet closer it's imaginative there is a special movement which goes on in this matters they understand what I said as you bring it here there is a movement there is the movement so each time the presence of the Lord so much in our presence [Music] he's going to come on I'm going to go and [Music] Hallelujah but you have to come to your Perfection foreign a possible it's a personal experience no money for a woman with the person of Life himself amen you get connected with life the essence of God himself amen amen so II Corinthians is not the history of Jesus [Music] [Music] Christ after the flesh yes foreign this is not flesh and blood is that life himself who had an experience I know many review with Christ in person amen amen he said let me tell you you people who knew him after the flesh he says he says do we now know him no more after the flesh amen Amina there are so many that hunted with brother brother but the level of the world is beyond this natural assistant amen Amina this time one you know let me say the one who was known as Jesus after the Flesh and now we know him after the power of his results that's what is happening in the bridge it has nothing to do with the Pentacles it has nothing to do with those organizations now buddy when Solomon is speaking about him he says he brought me to the banqueting house the kumbaga yeah yeah and this burner over me was love is that's what Solomon says he called me into the banqueting house is burning Over Me Is Love yeah together I want to bring it in here foreign Kings perfect are you together so that's why he says come up here because in order to come to my banquet foreign [Music] the revelation of the go well amen you remember when I was talking to your sister when I was talking about the king's man well when a man goes into captivity the only person that could redeem me his own family had to be so rich to redeem the man in the captives and this man hears I don't know was referred to as the go away amen so now Revelation 5. is the revelation of the go well when the lion becomes foreign is the revelation [Applause] at that time he does not only take the one who has the ability who has got enough money amen as fast crisis conceptually was the ability to put down his life away and take it again of course you have to be so well that when he does it she does not enjoy his economy Hallelujah but Revelation is revelation is that nature is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] expressed in Christ he was God's character he was God's expressed image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater hallelujah praise God yes sir now let's talk about the Gap the bridge see we are going to take time and I trust you are going to be blessed by the time we come through this series you know it's a bridge and the bridge you know if I have a hedge here anything that is a hole here that's a bridge if I speak about it from another angle from this to this we've got a bridge here we never make it to the one Okay so you know this is us and this is heaven how could you ever get there without a man coming to bridge this Gap together so in the bridge here Johnny comes from the world he can only get up here through this bridge put the bridge okay foreign look at the pressure that's in the Gap yeah there's too much pressure I'll give you examples when God blessed him in the Gap to bring the bridge that the bride over the bridge too much pressure you are going to understand because during the course amen Amina sometimes and call the people because there is generations of vipers who has want you to flee that rafters it was pressure in the Gap when Jesus called Harold the fox yesterday go and tell that fox your congratulations it was precious but then he was double nature he had the nature of mechanism Amen to go through the feelings but yet at the same time [Music] of Christ I mean of God obviously go and tell that fox congratulations but at the end of it amen to come from that Kinsale to subject himself to doing the will of God heal the center to my will but your will be done he submitted himself amen amen it was such currency he subjected himself and he entered into Isaiah 53 yeah before you shall grow up before he must attend a plan and that's the root out of the dried ground he has no forms there's no beauty that we should desires despite them rejected of men yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign and God will tell him God and he says I've not felt a Feeling this Gap here Revelation was bitter for him and John yokana need that Revelation yes of Revelation 5 work week later to be sure that is the name is trouble understanding what I teach does not save you yeah understanding the true history of the Lord Jesus Christ doesn't save you understanding the ministry of William brothers does not save you to come to Revelations Charlie [Music] into contact with Heavenly reality if you have not finished reading the bridge go back because this is just an introduction he says I'm trying to finish in the next 10 15. but don't watch time amen yes sir in the bridge message he says what a jubilee going on in heaven when the love leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claims amen you know that God next to John he must have seen his name right there when themselves we must got real happy I know listen what he says praise God praise the Lord amen when you know he says what a jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leaves that intercessory box to claim I mean to possess his clay okay [Music] we have value but when the lamb leaves because he was told I'll show you things that will be here so John went into Vision about how the lamb leaves his throne to possess his claims meaning that John was looking at a future events when the Redemption is done and the claiming is over and is taking his clay now Redemption has three packs there is and then there is claiming A continuing claiming which has been in FSS the ones that are his claiming them and then at the end of it there is foreign you know he says brother Branham says here what a jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leaves he doesn't leave the intercessory until the last elected one by you is so is the lab still there your blood um amen amen we are not at that spot yet that Johnny was looking at because Christ is still reaching out for his claims of redemption the last name also has to come through the processification sanctifications [Music] [Music] [Music] and our children are still believe is having to be no are you together with me so you put the blood away from the outer colors you are keeping yourself out because you still make mistakes and you need mercy on your children too when you say oh there's no blood I'm sorry you are putting yourself out Messiah [Music] but before people maybe you know some people have preached and they said there's no more blood on the Master Seat and you know ready they will try their level best to prove that there is no blood on the Massachusetts but they still repent of sinach oh God forgiving you know according to those what we are doing from our church going out and reaching out for the lost souls baptizing hundreds and hundreds of them it contradicts their popular doctrines and yet at the same time they baptize their own children you see where I'm coming from you see once you lend yourself to a wrong Doctrine always it sticks somewhere in your subconscious but second Timothy 2 17. all right have you retained some strength because we are going to wrestle with the engine before we get out of this side how many of you want to do that but wrestle with the angels amen Amina he said you know according to this wrong Doctrine he says of whom is a menace and filaters who concerning the truth ever since that the resurrection is passed already this is the moment you keep people in the wrong doctor throws their face you are not going anywhere until the last selected one is found yeah we are just preparing for the coming of the Lord you are going nowhere because the last election by you is not here yet amen Amina you know Christ will just you know stay on that Revelation 19. the bride has made herself ready to go and look and look selected by you and go through the phases of redemption you'll keep saying we are waiting for the cards our wrong approach to the bridge will keep Christ in his long suffering because where's the last selected foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] press play foreign amen amen revelation 5. let's just scan through the first five verses Revelation 5 verse [Music] represents you and me it represents the church that has been called out of organization and is in the bridge foreign [Music] that book was uh Scrolls so now the first crowd like this and they want to bring us the second one would be bro no work the third one would be broken [Music] okay got it so now Revelation 5 1. a book written within the back side with seven seats let it represent the seventh seeds it was sealed and he was Seated on his throne with this book The reason why you are here you are going to understand [Music] it was the names of the redeems [Music] but your soul [Applause] praise God the book contained the names of the sons and daughters these names and the Divine protection hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you [Music] it is [Applause] [Music] of God for everyone of those Souls foreign [Music] you are predestinated amen Amina Acts chapter 1 verse 15. you know I wake up in the morning sometimes when I'm on this spot when I get back when are you I'm just as weak as anything is over amen Amina so I don't know how long but as long as I am and these young men are taking these recordings for me to put this forward amen I'm Anna it's chapter one verse 15. and in those days later stood up in the midst of the disciples the names I mean he stood up in the midst of disciples and says he was in the upper room and now the scripture says the number of names together a member of the names was 120 Mary [Music] magada Maria Simon Peter Simone so what's your name already there was one hundred twenty names is anonymous with the character of the past Arena so in the upper room was 120 Souls man you had the ability to live the life of the Lambs so the name in the book of the Lamb means the soul whose character is influenced by the life of the Lamb [Music] woman so those in Revelation 5 1. amen did not have a revelation of who they
