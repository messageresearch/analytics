name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord we pray praise the Lord let's go to the word straight let's open rans Romans praise the Lord Romans 5 okay let's start from verse one the Bible says therefore therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into his this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations tribulation work patience and patience experience and experience so [Music] the Lord the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word we may be seated now I want to thank God for the opportunity the pastors gave stand before the purch of the blood of Christ me all the time to stand before people who the word look at what are going to say what they don't know just depend upon the of to lead us through praise the Lord this evening [Music] uh let's have something very simple yes about the personal experience with God my is the personal experience with amen amen and I know most of us we have heard of God the Lord we have heard about is that right and we have read about him some people have seen Hima the Lord we have seen God in ways praise Lord if you not seen the prophet always says Lord one of the Lord if you are one of them you will receive God and then Jesus said that you will see me but they will not praise the Lord so we have confidence that we see praise the Lord but then that see I want to talk about the experience that you have with the you see praise the Lord personal experience with but here says experience in other words it starts with Paul Paul starts with therefore being just by fath Praise the Lord it is Faith in that Us Praise the Lord if you don't have faith in how can you Beed how will you know him how will you see him if you don't faith in him praise the Lord the Bible starts with being justified by faith have peace with God through our Lord Jesus praise the Lord PA also in Hebrews without faith it is impossible to believe God meaning if you don't have faith then you don't have peace praise the Lord you don't have peace because those who are justified by faith they they have peace with God other God is can easily identify himself with them praise the Lord it is very easy if you have peace with God to unveil himself to you it is very easy to when you have peace with God God can easily unfold himself with you praise the Lord but if you don't have peace with him how can he unveil himself the Lord and then today in this hour in this hour Lord Lord the prophet says he has unveiled himself among the Believers praise the Lord so if you don't have peace with him if you don't have faith in God he can't unfold himself with to you praise the Lord so faith in God him to have peace with you praise the Lord I'm talking about personal experience with God after you have peace with God then by whom also we have access by faith praise the Lord the that we have now came because we have peace with God it came because we first believed God came because we LED God praise the Lord until the writer says I am no longer to linger praise the Lord why don't you linger because you have PE with God why don't you linger you are already in the of God which has made you to stand praise the Lord that makes us to stand praise the Lord once you have peace with God you believe his word and his word rules in your Affairs of Life there no way you can linger praise the Lord there's no way you can linger storms arise in which circumstance you are resed praise the Lord praise the Lord because you have a personal experience with the god whom you serve praise the Lord PA says where in by the grace that we we stand in and rejoice in hope to the glory of God praise the Lord when you see this first one verse and second praise the Lord there are no TR up here you are before God you have peace with him there's no trouble in those two vers praise the Lord in them you have no works there because we are justified by faith not our faith but God's faith praise the Lord so we have no Works in these two then verse comes not only in the first two verses where you have peace with God where you at Comfort zones he says not only so glory in tribs also praise the Lord even though we have peace with God even though God is always at our side that is good but there is time of trition that is coming and knowing that trition work patience allow me to say this God who let it come praise the Lord he is God who let this one come why so that you are patient praise the Lord God can let troubles come you are patient praise the Lord and when patience comes God will say wow then that's good that patience when it has come then it is going to bring it's going to bring experience praise the Lord of God bring experience in God and when experience comes then you have hope for God praise the Lord going have hope in God even though God told us the Rapture is coming because of the experience you have with him you hope for it praise the Lord you're going to hope for it praise the Lord and that hope does not make somebody get asham praise the Lord praise the Lord the experience of God you're going through it can't make you get ashamed to share it outside of other people praise the Lord just like putting on longes praise the Lord just like not putting on lipsticks baching I don't think people ashamed of not doing those things praise the Lord if they are not ashamed even putting on trousers I don't think people ashamed of not putting on praise the Lord but then do the same do the same as you tell the people that you put on wrong dresses I'm saying if putting on trousers doesn't ashame somebody if not putting on to if it is notam then let the word the message that we believe be the same also to put in the forward of the unbelievers praise the Lord because you're not ashamed that experience with God do not asame you praise the Lord and I tell you this anybody who has that experience they going to fight you the Lord they going to fight you they going to oppose you but that doesn't mean is not the will of God praise the Lord those oppositions have come tribs have come to work patience and after the patience after experience and after the hope then you can't be ashamed praise the Lord anybody with the experience of God can't be ashamed of it praise the Lord you can't be ashamed of that experience of God unless you don't know what you have praise the Lord now tribulations in this case may refer to physical hardships [Music] sufferings distresses that we go through praise the Lord but that way Slowly by slowly we begin to gain [Music] experience with if we only can realize all what we are going through it is the working of God praise the Lord if you see that God is working things in your life your attentiveness or your intent or your attention should draw on what does God want me through all this you not those marks no why you not out the working of God you develop experience with God praise the Lord you start experience with God when circumstances come sometimes to try you you don't fall praise the Lord like PA says God has has never allowed a trial to come upon his children is beyond their stand praise the Lord why he first puts you on trial test you that whenever trial comes God is confident that my child will have hope and will not be ashamed of my experience that I've shown him and after that the of God will make you go through that praise the Lord sometimes we narrate situations and then we don't know how things would have gone if you were there praise the Lord sometimes weend and say oh I wish I was there I wish I was Joseph the truth is if you look at howar yourself on Facebook or Whatsapp Facebook if you like to look on women you wouldn't Escape woman's wife if were there am I right like if you like looking naked women all women who put on if's wife would come to make you go with her I don't think you esap because is there praise the Lord so don't wish to be like Joseph if youe the word now don't wish to be like Joseph if you can't respect God even when the pastors are not with you there for jph to tell him that that wife is not yours the Lord was alone but because of the experience that him to go through when such circumstances came he was so praise the Lord and he used the experience of God to over that woman praise the Lord the Lord let's go to Psalms I've always wanted David all in my sermons I love David Psalms I mean 1 Samuel 24 so here comes a scenario that words passed around praise the Lord words passed around that David wants to overtake Soul's throne and sa was an isite praise the Lord he was a brother praise the Lord now it came to pass they wanted they wanted to blackma David and people came to and told him that David wants to take your thr praise the Lord and the B says verse one 24 ver1 and it came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines that it wasid is in the Wilderness of Praise the Lord now this man he took Horsemen men were chosen men talented men praise the Lord then he took them 300 and they followed David they went to seek David while they were there the men of David said unto him now verse three says and it came to pass the ship CAU by the way where was a cave and so went in to cover his feet and his men remained in the side of the cave words it was one C with some dimensions in them yeah the entrance was so if you if you were an enemy and you inside and then opponent is looking for you and finds you in there what was expected there it was death praise the Lord what happen the grace of God Cav praise the Lord and it made so full praise the Lord he couldn't understand that someone can beide there praise the Lord this was a president of the nation president how coulds not that the Lord like told you when the is coming here they going to check even your they going to check why this place has a door what is inside here they going to check every corner which you think you don't have any threat for it why is that thing there to but when he comes here be if they get scar of you they will put you out even though you are a member so I wonder these gods of soul president praise the Lord they entered the enemy's territory what is interesting the men of David another verse the men of David they told behold the day which the Lord said unto thee behold I deliver th enemy into th that thou may do to him as it shall seem good isav and the people reminded about the word which God told him that when your enemy comes williver him in your hands it is upon you to do right before you that was David the word of God had mared him praise the Lord but then what happens praise the Lord what happened praise the Lord is and it came to pass verse five that after afterwards that David's heart him because he had cut off Soul praise the Lord now just imagine if you had killed him praise the Lord because just cutting off the of this man it convicted him praise the Lord so in other words the heart that SM him he remembered that God knows how to answer words praise the Lord even though he told to go do whatever you want to your people first get wisdom praise the Lord otherwise if you lack wisdom you may do something that will be aice to the Lord the word to do it praise the Lord that's why many people how to to ask funny questions to Believers and yet finally they are not even in the courts they ask them praise the Lord can tell you show me a message where the Prophet gets women to young it's not there praise the Lord but God works with hiss praise the Lord that's why any that you doible says is there no Among Us Praise the Lord they ask they bring qutes and bring them to a situation may for praise the Lord but yet the word of God at that spot brought the enemy David never told him to K however I told him him in your hands whatever you want to do do it but even cutting off the of the King was not atace praise the Lord then if he him what would praise the Lord as Believers we should to develop a personal experience with God experience it will always teach us it always give us a new revelation of the word of God at that State praise the Lord otherwise you think what defend you even when the pastor knows it is he will say is true that's your mentality but the experience of God given people a good testimony praise the Lord anybody who had got experience of God the testimonies have always been right praise the Lord that's why when we read about David were trials he was going through your enemy is not tell you to kill him praise the Lord maybe has brought the enemy that by your patience you serve the person but then for you cing the Lord so God knows how to bring things in order that's why I I feel like whatever thing that we go through that comes to us or Be watchful God is always behind those things praise the Lord God is always behind those things praise the Lord they would come praise the Lord because God is always watchful over us God is always careful with our life otherwise he wouldn't die for us praise the Lord so the experience of God hereid learned and got a very good testimony in this in this case praise the Lord I don't want to read the whole chapter you read it but these lasts verse the Bible says [Music] now this is the enemy who is testifying was testifying you first go to verse 18 thou Hast showed this day how that thou Hast dealt with me for as much as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killest me not that was so praise the Lord another and then it says for if a man finds his enemy will he let him go look at the enemy testify because for David God was with him so the spirit of evil was upon him but if David used to kill wouldn't be any testimony this how I enemies tesy about us these are real Believers you find the with unbeliever with your musim neighbors when they about their husbands they talking F [Music] children bring your children in that [Music] mtim there even Believers nowadays they don't fear to climb up to pastors how that is like you know you don't fear to even speak such a thing to a pastor where is that testimony because such a good way you are stumbling now if some wanted to kill you praise the Lord someone want to kill you somebody at peace with you again you somebody for nothing the way he speaks the way Hees but what problem is that now if I have come with a spear to spear how how much would you speak praise the he wanted to be killed David wased to be killed and for him he showed kindness and then after that is telling him in other words he's telling him what heev that for me if I find my enemy the truth isav in there that anger he had in the coming of the was dead praise the Lord that's why he's telling him can a man let him go well with meise Lord but the th who is blessing en praise the Lord so the experience of God it has a good testimony at the end of the praise the Lord every other time whenever there is a good testimony there has been an experience OFA the Lord the Lord you know one thing I I learned from here once you have an experience with God it will be easy for you to learn how to deal with praise the Lord that's what I learned from here it's very easy once you have the experience of God with even when they are in the praise the Lord why brother Bram says this statement I believe God's children is scattered out everywhere theyed everywhere children are scattered out out there and then he says in another even though they are scattered are brothers we may we may dis this is the prophet I'm quoting we may disagree upon different things are still brothers and sisters we love each other when the love of God is in our hearts and the prophet says even being enemies [Music] this is what David had got even being enemies as if we would have any we which we have probably which we are probably we have them praise the Lord but still we love them [Music] no matter what what no matter what of estate they are in they are God children so if they children and you C them are you a child of God because if these are God's children also a child of God the prophet says he says these words there is something about God's children they know one another this is another message so if the other people are God's children also a child of God and you meet the prophet says there is something not in that message there is something about God's children what is that something they know one another in other words they deal with one another as with children of God so there something about the children of God they know one another something that's always been they know one another praise the Lord so even though people tend to act as enemies and they make you to go through tribulations even though they are believers one thing you remember not so no Romans 5 verse not only praise the Lord not only so but Romans 5 of you know not only so so I'm saying INE these children of God tend to act like enemies what you remember not only so but we also glory in tribs [Music] also that tribution you are going through patience and that patience that trition another verse works even experience [Music] work experience it also bring hope when hope comes when comes make us not ashamed praise the Lord so meaning that experience you have with God can make you ashamed even to put it on your stus praise the Lord you can't be ashamed praise the Lord one time so you know I don't know one time so I mean David comes a scario that the brothers are stumbled in the battle and the truth is they didn't have Hope of Victory there praise the Lord were tented what were children of and andum they don't know what to do they until even the chief captain saw himself the Bible says was greatly afraid but then the captain is afraid praise the Lord if the Great Captain has feared praise the Lord what happened since they were God's childrenfor praise the Lord God didn't leave them comfortless praise the Lord what happened he made the Father's Heart to to know what going while he sends David in battle he didn't tell David if your brothers are stumbled the father had nothing in him for that but him the experience he had with that Shing he knew all times we Face battles so he didn't leave his weap back he carried f with a shrink but he didn't know he's going to fight anybody there so that gives us a lesson as believer though we are Living Church make sure you are equipped even though you living your houses make sure you are equipped otherwise between your home and your house your home and where you're going so many things that will dis you praise the Lord but you the weap back to beat going to fight with praise the Lord so we are meant to be equipped equipped with a string went to the battlefield neither did the father first trained him that you know when you meet a certain man you he never he brought a young lion and he he sh it he brought a young bear he it let me tell you this what things we go through if they when things are make sure you understand and listen and watch God is training you for a certain thing he will not tell you not tell you fight a certain big thing first wants to bring a certain thing in your level see where do you draw your confidence where is your fa praise the Lord David he in the battle now the people no movements no shaking things was why quiet the brothers came Fu who sent you here you man who brought you in B before brings a statement what have you done come to go go go they took the food and they just him you see people with the ration of God experience you them here they bring another the other look at Joseph the he became a prime minister the other prime minister praise the Lord this is a man with God is experience [Music] people hish came toize his life come and with me he had a focus he never turned to such praise the happened he went to the throne so let me tell you this God has always ordered our plans even before we start getting them God always made our he has always made our Destinies even before we even started the Lord Here Comes Joseph but they F him soav by the of God they say go back home he didn't go because the prophet says he was a rud man I don't know which word but something you know what happen and went to one of the servants come here they said there's a man you there man there then was like what will be on the man who that it was in The Experience he had with God praise the Lord The Experience he had with God in the in the field the one that sh G praise the Lord because what did he start with they brought him before theing I'm going to that the king said you present an experience here have you fought in battle you a man this man even testified to this man has fought battles once when he was a youth and has defeated him praise the Lord but David said it's okay but I also have an experience what happened when I was keeping my father's [Music] flock shim came and I it was not enough to fight talking this Manar he has with it not that enough David now he was telling the king that's not enough also talking about people with wisdom you're bringing about the Lord an animal you can put some small small food there but yet you have trapped it in it it lands in the TR man go through that praise the Lord Man by the time heed up testimonies were about animals who was there to watch him do that praise the Lord people knew the Lord The Experience he had God by Grace he was at peace with praise the Lord The Experience he had it was at peace with then why stand behind praise the Lord he said God who delivered me praise the Lord so meaning David is not the one who who fought those things it was God working him through it praise the Lord praise the Lord even us whatever we are going through not down the experience you got through it one time it will be exam praise the Lord whatever we go through the experience that we go through praise the Lord because at the end of the day be an ex praise the Lord praise the so the prophet says I read the prophet and there was AUD David just a youth with his little sheep coat wrapped around him walked up into the face of those pharohs made them ashamed of themselves praise the Lord he made them ashamed you captains you armies can one man def the arm of God praise the Lord and he said you stand there the trained Army of the Living God the of Praise the Lord so what happens even us sometimes we make praise the Lord sometimes let the def us why we are trained of God praise the lord we have the word and the word is powerful so why do we stand before G let him def us what happens The Experience he had with God he said I will go fight him myself he didn't know where the victory will come and the experience he had made him stand brought out a good testimony praise the Lord then the prophet says so verse 41 so know nothing about that what happens 41 verse so know nothing about that praise the Lord and then what happens you have Pastor so he know nothing about that so he went to church everyb I wish we see the things quickly because you know he even though sa went to church every Sabbath verse 41 the prophet says he have done all religious things he may have done all religious things praise the Lord and then what happens he says that the rest of them done the point you have passed he have done all things the of them done he never he had never had an experience so you can't fight glor without experience you can't fight the enemies without the experience of God how praise the Lord after enemies they eat strong food like you eat and some of them go to witcraft you turn to God then praise the Lord because depend on God's experience to meet he was very confident me go and fight him myself and verse 42 says it says and what happened David said when I was standing my father's ship now this are testimonies out there then I wish I see this he says what happened says when I was Turing my father's sheep out there when I looked down to the Green Pastures praise the Lord and by the still Waters I Lear I learned of a [Music] God who made the heavens and the Earth praise the Lord that's what he saying praise the Lord in other words he had an experience to see what God would do therefore he know that experience would carry him on to Victory praise the Lord so I want to finish here by saying then praise the Lord praise the Lord so he says go tell my servant David I know he was just a little rude thing I know he was wearing a ship coat but I took him away from the ship coat and a ruler of my people like the great men in the Earth praise the Lord how God that sincerity of Faith to believe him praise the Lord saw the experience of God in David upon that experience God made him AER now to us now where there is unbelief move praise the Lord where there is unbelief can't do any work because the B clearly says never many miracles anywhere because of their unbelief praise the Lord he never need anything because of their un praise the Lord but then to us Psalms 119 and verse 59 it says verse 1 I mean verse 59 verse 59 you know as to us Believers when we think on our ways which ways the ways that we have taken off the word of when we think upon them having heard the word of godav says when I thought on my ways and turned my feetto testimonies praise the Lord when we check and find out our ways they are notching the word David advises us Toto the ways that have the testimonies of God praise the Lord so he says the prophet do few ques then we close few few he says check your experience with God check your experience with God see check your experience with God praise the Lord check your experience with God see if [Music] something [Music] you cled on the testimonies that he went through when God was saving him from a she bear when God was saving him from a lion he called on that that when the enemy came he used that experience and wasal praise the Lord the prophet is saying check your experience with God if something really has got a hold of you that brings you back to this word away from Creeds and forms and so [Music] forth check your experience it drives you from the word of God that experience dries you from the word of God that experience we have if it doesn't agree with the word of God with thees of God from that the testimony of the Lord testimon matches with the word then the testimonies will rise and people see praise the Lord praise the Lord so usually the prophet says people who have faith are people who have experience the Lord people have faith in the word of God people who have faith people who have a good testimony people who are going toote theise the Lord that when God wants Tove someone in of bringing sermons your life alone brings a s in the church your actions your speeches speak the people praise the Lord praise the Lord wow so my last statements that's why I think in these lessons that we are having now great thing to the church I'm quoting it's a great thing to the church because it brings them to a place that all scriptures tie together and our experience with God it must tie with the with that scripture Lord our experience with that scripture oh here it is if it doesn't tie with [Music] scriptures then it's strong praise the Lord then it's wrong praise the Lord he says also the last quote what is it God is word anchored in your flesh that gives you eternal life that gives you the resurrection power to bring you from the things of the world from the blind traditions of men walk in the sunlight of the health of God that's what the that's what the comforter does it lifs you out of that cellular condition it brings you up in the presence of God you an experience praise the Lord so when we have the word of God and it is anchored in our flesh and that word gives us Comfort it is that word it's meant Lift us up into the presence of God and gives us an experience with God praise the Lord so when that experience has come we can't sh away from it praise the Lord may the Lord bless you brother Moses I am resoled no long to CH by the world the [Music] [Music] to
