[27:20] Father
[27:22] that we can come into your presence.

[27:28] in your name,
[27:31] we will be there in their
[27:33] Lord. We believe you're here in our
[27:35] medies.
[27:37] We pray that Lord you may speak to us
[27:40] the words of eternal life.
[27:43] So hear our prayers.

[27:58] commit all the needs of the children of
[27:59] God into your heart
[28:03] with those who are around and those who
[28:04] are not around.
[28:07] that your grace may meet everyone
[28:11] and bless us together Lord
[28:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[28:15] pray and ask this
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; I greet you in the name of our Lord
[28:20] Jesus Christ.
[28:23] So I request we turn to our Bibles.
[28:28] Praise the name of our Lord.
[28:30] We are going to the book of Luke.
[28:34] Luke
[28:40] Luke chapter 14 from verse let me just
[28:43] pick a few scripts verses here. Luke
[28:46] chapter 14
[28:50] and then we read in verse
[28:54] 26
[29:00] Luke 14 26
[29:05] The Bible says,
[29:13] "If any man come to me and hate not his
[29:18] father and mother and wife and children
[29:21] and brethren and sisters, yeah, and his
[29:26] own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
[29:50] and soever does not bear his cross and
[29:54] come after me, he cannot be my disciple.
[30:09] May God bless his word.
[30:12] So I want to share on the subject
[30:14] carrying your cross.
[30:19] Praise the name of our Lord.
[30:21] You know our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:25] when he was seated
[30:29] you know, he was seated with the
[30:31] Pharisees.
[30:34] And then when you you can get that
[30:36] background in Luke chapter 14,
[30:42] [Music]
[30:43] Luke 14 and verse one.
[30:50] And it came to pass as he went into the
[30:52] house of one of the chief Pharisees to
[30:55] eat bread on the Sabbath day that they
[30:57] watched him.
[31:12] So now he was actually with the
[31:14] Pharisees.
[31:17] And then there were many people who were
[31:19] seated at the feast that the Lord had
[31:21] gone to.
[31:26] And then when he started talking about
[31:28] the words of the kingdom of God,
[31:35] you know, and then people started
[31:37] admiring.
[31:39] And then one of the people who was at
[31:42] that feast
[31:45] in verse 15,
[31:47] the Bible says, "And one of them that
[31:50] sat at meat with him had these things.
[31:54] He said unto him, blessed is he that
[31:56] shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
[32:10] [Music]
[32:14] You know he said those people are going
[32:15] to eat bread.
[32:18] Those people are going to occupy
[32:22] you know in the kingdom of God.
[32:26] They are blessed. Praise the name of our
[32:28] Lord.
[32:30] Jesus started giving them another
[32:33] parable.
[32:36] And then he said, "A certain man made a
[32:39] great supper
[32:43] and asked many people to come."
[32:48] So he made his supper.
[32:50] And then he sent invitations.
[32:54] Come to my supper.
[32:57] Everything has been said.
[32:59] And then he said when he sent his
[33:02] servant at supper time to call the
[33:04] people
[33:06] said come all things are now ready
[33:18] and then they started giving excuses.
[33:24] One said I have bought a piece of
[33:26] ground.
[33:29] and I need to go and see it.
[33:33] You know, it's a rainy season.
[33:37] You know, I need to plant my seeds.
[33:41] You know, it's a harvest season.
[33:44] I need to see what the price of my goods
[33:46] in the market.
[33:52] You know, it's an a time of, you know,
[33:54] kind of, you know, taking animals to the
[33:56] market.
[33:59] And you know that the natural activities
[34:02] we do,
[34:05] they will continue on until you leave
[34:07] earth.
[34:10] Because that's what the scripture says
[34:13] as it was in the days of Noah.
[34:17] They were buying, they were selling even
[34:21] the day that it rained
[34:25] as it was in the days of Sodom and
[34:27] Gomorra.
[34:30] They were building, they were marrying,
[34:33] they were giving in marriage
[34:35] even when
[34:38] Sodom was destroyed.
[34:42] Now you see that we always get
[34:43] preoccupied by our unnatural activities.
[34:49] You know you have program from morning
[34:51] to evening.
[34:54] But now when you look at the time that
[34:56] God requires your time,
[35:00] the duration he requires you.
[35:04] It's not the whole day
[35:07] like the whole of the week.
[35:10] We have only one midweek service
[35:16] on Wednesday
[35:18] from 4:30 up to 7.
[35:22] And then you find it is difficult to
[35:24] allocate that time to God.
[35:29] So even these people had excuses.
[35:33] Oh, I'm too busy.
[35:35] You know, I have monthly reports to
[35:37] make.
[35:40] tomorrow.
[35:45] I have our investors. They have been
[35:46] occupying us today.
[35:50] I have my supervisors are on ground
[35:54] and my supervisor told me that he needs
[35:56] to spend time with me this evening.
[36:00] And God says okay.
[36:04] So they started giving excuses.
[36:08] H you know today it has not been raining
[36:10] the whole week
[36:14] and it rained today morning and last
[36:17] night.
[36:18] [Music]
[36:20] I need to go and finish my garden.
[36:24] You know just leaving to do for you
[36:25] planting is not good enough.
[36:30] Then you ask who made the rains rain?
[36:36] Praise the name of our Lord. Now the one
[36:38] who commanded the rain to rain,
[36:42] he's telling you now give me some time
[36:45] and then you go back to your do your
[36:46] things.
[36:48] This time is precious in my garden.
[36:52] You can wait another time.
[36:56] So the man want was looking at those
[36:59] people.
[37:02] He said blessed are those people who be
[37:04] in the kingdom of God.
[37:08] And then Jesus tells him
[37:11] the price that you need to pay
[37:16] to be in that kingdom
[37:18] is that there are things you have to
[37:20] surrender.
[37:23] There are things you have to deny.
[37:26] There are things you have to fulfate
[37:30] for you to gain the other.
[37:34] But you can't have both of them at the
[37:36] same time.
[37:38] He said you cannot love God.
[37:41] You can only love at the same time.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; You'll either like the m
[37:47] spending all your time even time for
[37:49] service in your place of work
[37:54] because that's love of m
[37:58] because from work you get money.
[38:02] So now the time of God
[38:05] you say huh I need to get more money
[38:06] here
[38:09] at this time that's when the traders are
[38:10] coming people are coming to buy
[38:16] but now you look at some of these don't
[38:18] have even any hope
[38:22] those Muslims in town in Ginger
[38:27] when it comes to around half midday
[38:32] They close. So we are going for prayers
[38:37] and they come back after they not have
[38:40] done what they mean to do.
[38:45] And then for us who know better.
[38:48] We have many excuses
[38:52] you know no it is a lot of time.
[38:55] How about places where they have morning
[38:58] fellowships, morning glory every day,
[39:04] lunch hour every day
[39:07] and then for us we have only one day
[39:10] but becomes difficult for us
[39:14] to come into the services of the Lord.
[39:18] So Jesus said they all begin to give
[39:21] excuse
[39:24] and you know God
[39:27] does not choose idle people.
[39:32] He always chooses busy people.
[39:35] He found Matthew at the customs.
[39:43] He found Peter James and John fishermen.
[39:52] You know they were not there that they
[39:53] were jobless. Now God you can we have
[39:56] time for God. It's not like that.
[40:01] You know there are some people who think
[40:02] that to serve God.
[40:06] I must be when I'm idle. I have nothing
[40:08] else to do.
[40:11] Then I can now have time for God.
[40:14] It does not work like that. Actually,
[40:17] God requires your best,
[40:21] your precious time,
[40:24] you know, your best time,
[40:27] your best energy,
[40:30] you know, your best, your best things,
[40:32] you want so much.
[40:35] Then he says, "Give me that."
[40:38] He wants us to give him the best.
[40:41] So now you see that people gave excuses
[40:46] and we find ourselves caught in the same
[40:48] situation.
[40:50] You know you find that you are saying ah
[40:52] now I need this more time. I need to do
[40:54] this. I need to do this.
[40:58] There's a brother we had here some years
[41:00] ago, maybe 10 plus years,
[41:05] and I I I think we're were raising him
[41:08] to be one of our song leaders
[41:14] and then he was doing senior 4
[41:17] [Music]
[41:20] around because seniors are in
[41:22] examination time
[41:26] &gt;&gt; and then
[41:28] So there is a Sunday he didn't come to
[41:30] pray.
[41:34] Now I think it took either a month or so
[41:36] I don't remember but then I I met him
[41:38] and I asked him brother what happened
[41:40] that you didn't pray with us on Sunday
[41:45] and you know I was doing I was praying
[41:47] for examinations
[41:51] exams are not on Sunday in government
[41:56] exams are not on Sunday
[42:01] but now he was uptaken there.
[42:05] So the question is supposing God comes
[42:09] supposing he comes in that same season.
[42:13] Praise the name of our Lord. He comes
[42:16] when he's meant to find you here. You in
[42:17] another place.
[42:22] It was very unfortunate
[42:24] that the brother didn't do well in those
[42:26] exams.
[42:29] He had to repeat.
[42:32] very unfortunate.
[42:34] But then the whole thing is how much do
[42:36] you value God in your life?
[42:41] These people had excuses.
[42:45] I have a ground. I'm a farmer.
[42:49] So excuse me.
[42:51] Then he went to another
[42:53] said, "I have bought five oxen.
[42:57] I need to prove them.
[42:59] I already put a lot of money in them.
[43:03] So you excuse me.
[43:05] Then again he went to another.
[43:08] I have just married a wife.
[43:12] I need my honeymoon.
[43:15] And now there are many brothers and
[43:18] sisters who marry
[43:20] [Music]
[43:23] when they have married church. They
[43:24] forget. I don't know what happens.
[43:27] They also forget church.
[43:30] Then they come back.
[43:34] This one was also giving an excuse.
[43:37] I'm just married.
[43:42] The things of God first. Hold on. Same
[43:45] thing here.
[43:47] And then another one.
[43:50] So now the Bible says when they came and
[43:53] told the master
[43:57] Then the master was very angry.
[44:03] Then he said okay.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You know now you look at the category of
[44:08] people the invitation of was first
[44:10] given.
[44:17] One was a serious farmer.
[44:22] He had enough money to buy a a farm.
[44:27] He was not a poor person there.
[44:30] Then another one had also got five yoke
[44:33] of oxen. That's not small money.
[44:38] Another one had just made a wedding.
[44:42] They were not poor people.
[44:45] And sometimes we think that the people
[44:47] who are educated that one going to
[44:50] receive the gospel
[44:54] or sometimes we think maybe my boss or
[44:56] my manager or my what
[45:02] they are given the invitation.
[45:06] They despise that invitation
[45:10] based on what they possess
[45:14] based on what really they they they own
[45:20] based on their position.
[45:23] Some of these what the Lord does
[45:28] if they are really the elect.
[45:31] What God does is he first make sure that
[45:35] removes some of those things that take
[45:37] their attention away from God.
[45:42] past loses a job
[45:45] say that he's not too busy for God
[45:48] and he become desperate to seek the Lord
[45:57] or some problems at home
[46:00] tried there. They have tried there and
[46:03] then now they start thinking about God
[46:07] or maybe sickness just comes and takes a
[46:09] hold of them.
[46:12] And they have spent a lot.
[46:15] That's when they can now look to God.
[46:18] But then we shouldn't be like those kind
[46:20] of people
[46:22] that I first have the problem come to me
[46:24] to awaken me to think about God.
[46:30] We need to be like David
[46:33] when he was a king. He thought about God
[46:36] in everything he was doing
[46:40] until he said, "I would rather be a data
[47:01] prime minister."
[47:03] But then he wouldn't cheat on the time
[47:05] of prayer.
[47:09] Every morning he made sure he was
[47:10] praying.
[47:12] Every evening made sure he was praying.
[47:16] The position in the kingdom
[47:20] did not take him away from God.
[47:25] Praise the name of our Lord. It also be
[47:28] the same thing with us.
[47:30] If God has blessed you with a job,
[47:34] let your job not take your attention
[47:36] away from God.
[47:39] If God has blessed you with wealth,
[47:44] you know, let them not take you away
[47:45] from God.
[47:48] God has blessed with a good family
[47:51] or whatever earthly possession,
[47:55] let it not take you away from God.
[47:58] Praise the name of our Lord. That song
[48:01] that we sing,
[48:03] nothing between me and my savior,
[48:08] nothing between
[48:10] let you have a clear vision of Jesus
[48:13] Christ.
[48:15] Praise the name of our Lord. Now when
[48:18] the these people the the highend people
[48:24] when they denied the invitation
[48:28] now the servants
[48:30] had to go to those people in
[48:36] those people in homes
[48:41] those who were there taking bangi
[48:45] king.
[48:47] They despised of the community.
[48:52] They said, "Please come."
[48:55] And what is interesting, most of them
[48:57] came.
[49:00] But even when they came,
[49:02] there was still room at the guest.
[49:09] Praise the name of Lord. So now even us
[49:12] when we are witnessing
[49:16] don't despise the person by his
[49:18] appearance
[49:24] but will this one understand
[49:27] the word praise the name of our lord
[49:31] about the goodness of the lord
[49:34] you can't tell that maybe this person
[49:36] who looks to be the worst person may be
[49:38] better than the religious person.
[49:46] The Bible says they came.
[49:49] But then the Bible says
[49:51] that those who were bidden
[49:57] and they didn't come,
[49:59] they shall not taste of my supper.
[50:05] Verse 24. For I say unto you, that none
[50:09] of those men which were bidden shall
[50:11] taste of my supper.
[50:19] Why? They counted themselves unworthy.
[50:24] And many times it is us who count
[50:26] ourselves unworthy.
[50:30] You despise the call.
[50:33] You despise the assembly of coming
[50:35] together as children of God.
[50:40] You despise reading your message books.
[50:45] You despise testifying about the
[50:47] goodness of the Lord.
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] You count yourself unworthy.
[50:55] But yet the door is open.
[50:58] Come unto me you are heavy laden.
[51:02] Whosoever will,
[51:05] let come and drink. Praise the name of
[51:07] our Lord. The invitation is given to all
[51:12] but few take it serious.
[51:17] So now this man was admiring
[51:21] those who will be sitting in the kingdom
[51:23] of God.
[51:25] But then to sit in the kingdom of God,
[51:30] you have to count
[51:32] that you know the things of God
[51:36] are more precious than the things that I
[51:39] have.
[51:41] Praise the name of our Lord to know and
[51:44] acknowledge.
[51:52] Praise the name of our Lord. That's what
[51:54] Abraham did. When Abraham got a divine
[51:58] call,
[52:01] then he had to leave the country of his
[52:03] parents.
[52:04] [Music]
[52:06] When you look at Moses, the same thing.
[52:09] He had to despise the position in the
[52:11] government of Pharaoh.
[52:16] The reproach of Christ to be greater
[52:18] riches.
[52:22] Now the Bible has told us
[52:25] if we are going to follow Jesus Christ,
[52:30] &gt;&gt; we have to deny everything
[52:34] and we have to bear his cross
[52:38] and then follow him. Praise the name of
[52:41] our Lord. You bear the cross of God.
[52:45] You bear the burden of God.
[52:48] And then he said, "My burden is light.
[52:52] Praise the name of the Lord. You carry
[52:55] it
[52:57] and follow me. Take my reproach.
[53:01] Take my my my my kind of humility.
[53:06] That's how the Lord wants us to do
[53:09] is not to carry
[53:11] the cross of Jesus Christ and then you
[53:14] carry it following him.
[53:18] So the Bible says you have to deny
[53:21] yourself.
[53:23] He said you deny your parents,
[53:26] you deny your sisters and brothers.
[53:29] In other words, you put God more
[53:31] important than all these other things.
[53:37] You know the Bible says that the soul
[53:40] that sinnth
[53:43] it shall die
[53:45] because God himself
[53:48] He has created these souls
[53:51] in Ezekiel 18:20.
[54:00] Ezekiel 18:20.
[54:04] The soul that sinnth, it shall die. The
[54:08] soul, the son shall not bear the
[54:11] iniquity of the father, neither shall
[54:13] the father bear the iniquity of the son.
[54:16] The righteousness of the righteous shall
[54:19] be upon him, and the wickedness of the
[54:21] wicked shall be upon him.
[54:34] for
[54:58] [Music]
[55:09] Praise the name of the Lord. So he says
[55:11] the righteousness of the righteous shall
[55:14] be upon him.
[55:18] And who demands the righteousness
[55:21] that is God who has created us.
[55:26] So now he says you have to deny
[55:28] everything
[55:31] you know for the sake of the kingdom of
[55:33] God.
[55:35] Now in the message greater than Solomon
[55:37] is here
[55:40] he says the church needs
[55:43] tonight
[55:45] not a soft hybrid something
[55:50] soft and flabby like a church is.
[55:56] Just make a confession,
[55:59] be baptized,
[56:01] and you are a Christian.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; To be a Christian
[56:07] is self denial.
[56:11] Praise the name of the Lord. Selfden
[56:15] your rights.
[56:19] You know your own decision making.
[56:23] You know like we are living in the the
[56:25] Rodician church age.
[56:28] It's an age of you know rights of the
[56:30] people
[56:34] you know this group right
[56:38] the other group right this group right
[56:42] animal right
[56:45] you know until in Japan
[56:47] they have an animal right
[56:50] I think it is a day
[56:53] and to to demonstrate on that day of
[56:55] animals
[56:58] They walk naked
[57:04] then they have animal they have
[57:06] different rights they put there
[57:11] in Europe they are telling stop eating
[57:13] meat
[57:18] you know they are making things coming
[57:20] up different things coming up all over
[57:21] the
[57:25] children, right?
[57:28] So like in those developed countries,
[57:32] the child can sit on top of a car
[57:36] and then you have to wait for the child
[57:37] until the child comes down.
[57:42] The child is right.
[57:45] You don't say anything against them.
[57:48] You have to beg them.
[57:51] It's the day that we are living in.
[57:55] Right. Right. Right. Right. But as a
[57:58] Christian,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; there is selfdenial.
[58:03] You deny many things that pertain to the
[58:06] comfort of this body.
[58:11] You deny
[58:13] &gt;&gt; at night
[58:15] some time of yours and put be yourself
[58:18] in prayer.
[58:22] You know, you spend some bit of time at
[58:24] night
[58:27] praying,
[58:29] &gt;&gt; waiting on the Lord.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you deny yourself food.
[58:36] You know, you deny it
[58:39] because you have to wait on the Lord to
[58:41] pray and fast.
[58:44] This Saturday, we having a praying and
[58:45] fasting meeting.
[58:49] But many times we get so busy
[58:53] and then you get the same people who
[58:54] keep on coming are the ones
[58:59] then others that day is not in my
[59:01] program
[59:04] and then even sometimes when we come
[59:07] we come here at midday
[59:11] at one
[59:13] you want to go back
[59:16] then you start wondering how much time
[59:17] have you spent before the Lord?
[59:21] But Christian life is selfdenial.
[59:26] You know, you have to deny many things.
[59:30] You have to deny the fashions of the
[59:32] world.
[59:34] You know, things that are obscene,
[59:41] &gt;&gt; you know, things that are provocative,
[59:46] you know, things that are seductive,
[59:49] you know, you deny them. You have to
[59:52] make judgment yourself
[59:55] what I'm dressing.
[59:57] Is it really worthy?
[1:00:00] the way I'm talking
[1:00:03] worthy.
[1:00:04] You know, there's a lot of selfdenial to
[1:00:07] be a Christian
[1:00:10] because some of these things are evil
[1:00:12] spirits.
[1:00:14] So, you don't want to be associated with
[1:00:16] an evil spirit.
[1:00:19] So then you have to take things with the
[1:00:21] way God wants us to do them.
[1:00:26] So he says you deny yourself,
[1:00:29] you take up your cross,
[1:00:32] you follow me daily.
[1:00:34] Today it is so soft
[1:00:38] and people call themselves Christians
[1:00:43] when it used to mean death to confess
[1:00:45] Christ.
[1:00:52] were
[1:00:54] and you had to depend on him daily
[1:01:00] for everything you have need of.
[1:01:04] Praise the name of our Lord denying
[1:01:07] yourself and then you take up the cross
[1:01:11] and then you follow the Lord Jesus
[1:01:12] Christ
[1:01:15] life.
[1:01:17] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:01:19] message revelation book of symbols
[1:01:23] he says
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Mr.
[1:01:31] Pastor Lily
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; he is a wonderful school
[1:01:37] a wonderful Bible teacher
[1:01:41] Mr. really is.
[1:01:46] He gets down into the valley,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; dark place,
[1:01:53] he pushed himself up through the
[1:01:56] darkness of the earth.
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:01] So what to do?
[1:02:04] To glorify himself
[1:02:07] to glorify everything that comes in
[1:02:09] contact with him.
[1:02:13] And he has to toil day and night
[1:02:18] to keep his radiance of beauty
[1:02:24] to keep the perfume flowing.
[1:02:30] You know now there are those
[1:02:32] those plants that grow in the swampy
[1:02:35] areas
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; and then now the roots are in the mud.
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:47] But for that plant to come out of that
[1:02:50] mud,
[1:02:53] it has to do a lot of struggling.
[1:02:58] It has to do a lot of struggling.
[1:03:02] And now when it comes on the surface,
[1:03:05] then it starts showing its presence.
[1:03:10] And then it puts on the flower.
[1:03:13] And that flower, you know, the bees can
[1:03:15] come and get nectar, different things
[1:03:17] from there.
[1:03:22] Perfume can come from there or a nice
[1:03:24] smell.
[1:03:26] But then he says it doesn't show itself
[1:03:30] or to kind of glorify itself.
[1:03:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So when it
[1:03:38] it comes out,
[1:03:41] you look at the top as being so
[1:03:43] beautiful,
[1:03:45] but beneath it,
[1:03:48] there are trials that it go through,
[1:03:51] frustrations that it go through.
[1:03:54] That is the life of a Christian.
[1:03:58] You know that you learn to love your
[1:04:00] enemy.
[1:04:02] You know, after God taking you through
[1:04:04] different situations,
[1:04:09] you know, because there are things that
[1:04:10] God permits you to go through
[1:04:15] like an eagle. Praise the name of our
[1:04:17] Lord. when it's going to lay its eggs,
[1:04:23] you know, it makes the nest so
[1:04:24] comfortable.
[1:04:28] It puts there, you know, the fur of the
[1:04:30] rabbits
[1:04:38] and then it makes it so comfortable.
[1:04:43] The real
[1:04:48] praise the name of our Lord. Very
[1:04:50] comfortable.
[1:04:52] The chicks come. They are there
[1:04:58] like mothers.
[1:05:01] You know they they prepare well for
[1:05:03] their children who are coming.
[1:05:06] A new baby show,
[1:05:09] a new baby what? I don't know what they
[1:05:11] use nowadays.
[1:05:14] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You know those days we did have those
[1:05:19] things like pumpers. We used to have
[1:05:20] napkins. Too many of them. So you
[1:05:34] So now the white life has been made
[1:05:36] easy.
[1:05:40] So now they make preparations of that.
[1:05:42] So well,
[1:05:45] so now when the the young eagle is just
[1:05:48] still young,
[1:05:51] just fed
[1:05:54] you know the mother keeps them watching
[1:05:56] over them.
[1:05:58] But the eagles are not going to live in
[1:06:00] the nest.
[1:06:04] So they have they are meant to fly.
[1:06:08] They are meant to kind of like go
[1:06:10] against winds,
[1:06:13] they are meant to hunt to live.
[1:06:17] Praise the name of our Lord. So even God
[1:06:21] when we are just coming here on earth,
[1:06:25] when we are coming into his kingdom,
[1:06:28] he can make everything very good.
[1:06:32] You know, you find there is joy,
[1:06:36] peace. The brother, the people you've
[1:06:38] got in church are so kind to you.
[1:06:44] Those kind of things, but it may not be
[1:06:47] like that forever.
[1:06:50] Then he starts steering the nest.
[1:06:55] You have accept the Lord Jesus as your
[1:06:56] personal savior.
[1:06:59] Everything at work is good.
[1:07:02] Then now your boss comes.
[1:07:05] You know
[1:07:06] the situation is not good.
[1:07:10] So instead of using 1 million,
[1:07:14] you're right. We have used 10 millions.
[1:07:20] But
[1:07:22] then they start hating you and see how
[1:07:25] they can dismiss you.
[1:07:29] and they are chasing you from the place
[1:07:30] of work because of the truth
[1:07:34] and you lose your job.
[1:07:37] Then you start wondering
[1:07:40] but all these are things to help you
[1:07:45] to develop the character of Jesus Christ
[1:07:49] because the Bible says Christ learned
[1:07:51] obedience by the things that he
[1:07:53] suffered.
[1:07:57] So even the ego at a particular time
[1:08:01] it has to remove everything that he has
[1:08:04] put there
[1:08:07] until the the igllets just start feeling
[1:08:10] the thorns
[1:08:14] inside is pressing
[1:08:17] them in the air.
[1:08:20] And then brother Brham says
[1:08:22] it's until that those eagles are put in
[1:08:25] a situation
[1:08:28] that's when they will learn to depend on
[1:08:30] the mother
[1:08:33] because he throws them in the in the air
[1:08:37] and then when they trying to fall comes
[1:08:40] and spreads the wings.
[1:08:43] So God also allows those to come.
[1:08:48] You don't have no salary.
[1:08:54] Now you start wondering how am I going
[1:08:55] to go through this man
[1:08:59] living by faith.
[1:09:01] Praise the name of our Lord. You start
[1:09:03] depending upon God.
[1:09:07] Children are going to school.
[1:09:10] No school fees. How are they going to
[1:09:12] study?
[1:09:14] You depend on the Lord all your
[1:09:16] lifetime.
[1:09:19] He's teaching you to depend upon him
[1:09:23] like the children of Israel
[1:09:25] when they were coming out of Egypt
[1:09:29] or when they were still in Egypt.
[1:09:31] The Bible says the the the the
[1:09:37] plagues that were in Egypt
[1:09:41] was not reaching in Gen.
[1:09:44] In Egypt they have darkness very thick.
[1:09:49] But then in go there is light.
[1:09:52] In Egypt the water is blood.
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:57] But then in go the water is okay.
[1:10:01] In Egypt frogs are all over everything.
[1:10:06] But go was protected.
[1:10:09] That is our God. That is our God
[1:10:12] rejoicing.
[1:10:15] The Bible say a mixed multitude.
[1:10:20] Everybody was rejoicing.
[1:10:23] They went through the Red Sea.
[1:10:26] They were all rejoicing
[1:10:29] after crossing.
[1:10:31] Ah, God is great. God is good. And then
[1:10:35] they started entering the wilderness.
[1:10:39] No food,
[1:10:40] no water,
[1:10:43] mixed multitude.
[1:10:47] to try them
[1:10:50] and that's why you need to bear the
[1:10:52] cross.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; You don't come to Christ because of
[1:10:56] benefit
[1:11:00] but you come to him
[1:11:02] say Lord where he leads me
[1:11:07] I will follow. Praise the name of our
[1:11:10] Lord. You are not afraid.
[1:11:14] Whatever comes,
[1:11:16] praise the name of the Lord because the
[1:11:18] Lord is with me.
[1:11:20] And that's what the Lord teaches us.
[1:11:23] That's what the mother eagle teaches the
[1:11:25] igl
[1:11:28] to teach it
[1:11:31] until it can also go and start hunting.
[1:11:36] Praise the name of our Lord. So even the
[1:11:39] le of the valley
[1:11:41] it does not live for itself.
[1:11:45] Then he says
[1:11:49] he's pulled day and night from the earth
[1:11:51] to give out.
[1:11:56] That's what a real Christian does.
[1:12:00] You pray and humble yourself
[1:12:04] and keep before God day and night.
[1:12:09] in order you might give yourself to
[1:12:11] somebody else.
[1:12:15] Not what you keep.
[1:12:19] It is what you give out that counts.
[1:12:25] You must give yourself to others.
[1:12:28] That's what Jesus did.
[1:12:31] He gave himself to others.
[1:12:35] Praise the name of our Lord. So now we
[1:12:37] need to see that we do the best we can
[1:12:40] for the kingdom of God.
[1:12:45] Put God first.
[1:12:49] Let God rule over all your things.
[1:12:52] And that means you have to deny
[1:12:54] yourself.
[1:12:56] You have to deny your rights and then
[1:12:59] see what does the Lord want me to do in
[1:13:00] this situation.
[1:13:04] Praise the name of our Lord. Maybe
[1:13:06] colleagues at your place of work,
[1:13:10] you have end of year party
[1:13:14] and everybody is dressing the way they
[1:13:16] want.
[1:13:18] How about you? What are you going to do?
[1:13:22] Oh, your fellow students.
[1:13:25] You know, everybody wants to identify
[1:13:26] themselves as I'm coming from this
[1:13:28] district,
[1:13:31] from this tribe,
[1:13:33] I'm coming from this school.
[1:13:35] We are now going to have a welcome
[1:13:37] party.
[1:13:40] What are you going to do or leave us
[1:13:43] party?
[1:13:45] There are things you have to deny
[1:13:47] yourself
[1:13:50] to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:53] Praise the name of our Lord. Now in the
[1:13:56] message Elijah and the meal offering
[1:14:01] he said and she said
[1:14:06] there it was the greatest consolation
[1:14:09] that any believer ever listened to.
[1:14:14] For thus says the Lord.
[1:14:17] That's the word she was waiting for.
[1:14:22] Thus says the Lord.
[1:14:24] The barrel will not go empty,
[1:14:28] neither will the cruise go dry
[1:14:32] until the day that God sends rain on the
[1:14:35] earth.
[1:14:38] What do we get there?
[1:14:41] Seek first the kingdom of God,
[1:14:44] and his righteousness,
[1:14:47] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:14:50] you.
[1:14:53] How do I know? Brother,
[1:14:57] how do I know? The only thing I know.
[1:15:02] Put God first
[1:15:06] and move on.
[1:15:08] Sacrifice.
[1:15:11] Mix the oil.
[1:15:14] The word and the spirit together.
[1:15:20] No more. Lay yourself upon the cross
[1:15:25] and say here I am Lord.
[1:15:30] Put God first in everything.
[1:15:34] Praise the name of our Lord. That should
[1:15:36] be our Christian life.
[1:15:39] The day that you leave,
[1:15:42] you have surrendered to the Lord Jesus
[1:15:44] Christ.
[1:15:46] And then your testimony is
[1:15:49] must Jesus bear the cross alone.
[1:15:53] You have to bear.
[1:15:55] Praise the name of the Lord. You know
[1:15:57] the Bible says we also suffer for his
[1:16:00] cause.
[1:16:02] And then he said he will give us
[1:16:05] everything
[1:16:08] 100%
[1:16:09] but with suffering
[1:16:12] denying yourself
[1:16:15] carrying his cross.
[1:16:18] They are not pleasant things.
[1:16:21] But then it is the way that the Lord has
[1:16:24] purposed
[1:16:26] to mold our character
[1:16:30] like a mother giving birth.
[1:16:34] There is a pain that comes.
[1:16:37] Praise the name of our Lord. But at the
[1:16:39] end of the day, there is joy.
[1:16:43] Praise the name of our Lord. Joy that
[1:16:46] I've given birth.
[1:16:48] Joy that I have a child.
[1:16:51] Praise the name of our Lord. He allows
[1:16:53] us to go through different situations,
[1:16:58] bear his name,
[1:17:00] carry the cross, and deny ourselves.
[1:17:04] Praise the name of our Lord. All this we
[1:17:07] do, we're not doing them in vain. Praise
[1:17:11] the name of our Lord. He comes and gives
[1:17:13] us the grace to go through them.
[1:17:17] Praise the name of our Lord.
[1:17:19] So the Bible says,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; "Praise the name of our Lord." In
[1:17:24] Galatians 6:14,
[1:17:26] as I try to finish,
[1:17:32] he says,
[1:17:35] "But God forbide that I should glory
[1:17:38] save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ, by whom the world is crucified
[1:17:43] unto me, and I unto the world.
[1:18:07] So you crucify yourself
[1:18:11] and then say, "Lord,
[1:18:13] the things of the world are passed,
[1:18:16] but I Put the things of God first.
[1:18:21] Praise the name of our Lord. Give God
[1:18:24] your best place.
[1:18:27] All your life, you give it to the Lord.
[1:18:30] All that you possess, you give it to the
[1:18:31] Lord. Lord, everything that I have, my
[1:18:36] life is in your hands. My possessions
[1:18:39] are in your hands. My family is in your
[1:18:41] hands.
[1:18:43] And then Jesus has told us,
[1:18:46] "Praise the name of our Lord." Let us go
[1:18:48] back to Luke where we read.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 14.
[1:18:59] Luke chapter 14.
[1:19:04] And then let us read in verse
[1:19:12] 626.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; If any man come to me and hate not his
[1:19:18] father and mother and his wife and
[1:19:22] children and brethren and his sisters,
[1:19:24] yeah, his own life also, he cannot be my
[1:19:28] disciples.
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:47] So there is a selfdenial
[1:19:51] in Mark chapter 10
[1:19:56] and then verse 37
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; he says He that loveth father or mother
[1:20:03] more than me is not worth of me. And he
[1:20:06] that loveth son or daughter more than me
[1:20:09] is not worth of me.
[1:20:26] And he
[1:20:28] that taketh not his cross and follows
[1:20:32] after me is not worthy of me.
[1:20:40] He that findeth his life shall lose it.
[1:20:43] And he that loses his life shall find
[1:20:47] it.
[1:20:54] Praise the name of our Lord. God wants
[1:20:56] us to sacrifice
[1:21:00] whatever we have
[1:21:02] your life, your family, your resources
[1:21:07] and then put them to the forefront of
[1:21:09] God
[1:21:10] and say, "Lord, I'm giving you all these
[1:21:12] things."
[1:21:14] And when you give them to him,
[1:21:17] it's like you're losing them,
[1:21:21] but then you are gaining them at the end
[1:21:23] of the day.
[1:21:26] But then you don't give him then you
[1:21:28] lose.
[1:21:30] Praise the name of our Lord. So we need
[1:21:32] to carry the cross
[1:21:35] and follow Jesus Christ. You deny
[1:21:38] yourself.
[1:21:39] You take on the word of the Lord.
[1:21:42] Praise the name of our Lord. He said,
[1:21:44] "My yoke is easy,
[1:21:49] so come unto me
[1:21:51] and you'll find rest for your souls.
[1:21:55] My yoke is easy
[1:21:57] and my burden is light." So every day
[1:22:01] let us carry our cross and follow the
[1:22:04] Lord Jesus Christ denying yourself
[1:22:08] your rights
[1:22:10] your privileges
[1:22:12] and say Lord I'm just coming before you
[1:22:16] in the name of our Lord. May God bless
[1:22:18] you.
[1:22:20] Amen.
[1:22:22] Let us sing that song as we each of us
[1:22:24] go to pray.
[1:22:26] Must Jesus bear the cross.
[1:22:31] Amen. There is a cross for me. There is
[1:22:34] a cross for you.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Song 89.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Must Jesus
[1:22:44] bear the cross alone
[1:22:50] and all the world go free.
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] Lord, there is a cross for everyone
[1:23:05] and there is a cross for me.
[1:23:12] The ghosted
[1:23:17] cross
[1:23:20] till death shall set me free.
[1:23:28] And then go home my crown to well for
[1:23:36] there is a ground for me.
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] Upon
[1:23:45] the green stop
[1:23:50] down at Jesus
[1:23:54] fe
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:59] with joy out
[1:24:03] my God and crown
[1:24:07] and peace
[1:24:09] at every
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:14] Oh precious
[1:24:16] cross,
[1:24:18] all glorious
[1:24:20] crown, glory.
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:30] The angels
[1:24:32] grow, the stars come down
[1:24:37] and
[1:24:39] my soul
[1:24:42] away. Now let us sing. Where he leads
[1:24:45] me, I'll follow. Amen.
[1:24:48] I can hear
[1:24:51] my Savior
[1:24:56] calling.
[1:25:00] I can hear
[1:25:04] my savior
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:09] calling.
[1:25:13] I can hear
[1:25:17] my souly.
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:26] Let thy
[1:25:30] son

[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:38] me. Where he leads me.
[1:25:42] Where he leads
[1:25:46] me,
[1:25:48] I
[1:25:51] will follow.
[1:25:54] Amen, Lord.
[1:25:56] where he lives.
[1:26:02] I
[1:26:04] will follow
[1:26:07] [Music]
[1:26:10] where he lives
[1:26:14] me.
[1:26:16] I
[1:26:19] when
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:25] I'll go with
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:33] thee
[1:26:35] all
[1:26:37] the way. where he leads me again as we
[1:26:40] go to pray.
[1:26:42] Where he leads
[1:26:45] me,
[1:26:47] I
[1:26:50] will follow
[1:26:53] Lord.
[1:26:56] Where he leads
[1:27:00] me,
[1:27:02] I
[1:27:04] [Applause]
[1:27:05] will follow.
[1:27:11] Where
[1:27:13] is
[1:27:15] me?
[1:27:17] I
[1:27:19] will follow.
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:26] I'll go with
[1:27:33] him
[1:27:35] all
[1:27:38] the way. You can now speak to the Lord.
[1:27:41] Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ, how we thank you, Father, for
[1:27:47] your love, grace, and mercy. Lord,
[1:27:50] you've been so gracious unto us, Father.
[1:27:53] You've been so merciful unto us, Lord.
[1:27:55] And we worship you, Lord. We adore you,
[1:27:58] heavenly father. And our confession
[1:28:00] tonight, Lord Jesus, is wherever you
[1:28:03] lead us, Lord, we want to follow, Lord,
[1:28:07] through different situations, Lord. And
[1:28:09] how you said some through the waters and
[1:28:12] some through the fine and some through
[1:28:14] the floods, but you are still the same,
[1:28:16] God, that you make us go through the
[1:28:19] blood. It's by going through the blood
[1:28:21] that we even have life and life eternal.
[1:28:25] We have strength, Lord, and abilities,
[1:28:27] heavenly father, to overcome every
[1:28:30] circumstance that we go through in life.
[1:28:32] How we worship you, heavenly father. How
[1:28:35] we glorify thy name. Help us in the name
[1:28:38] of Jesus Christ to deny ourselves Lord.
[1:28:42] Oh God, you said that we need to deny oh
[1:28:45] God our families, how we need to deny
[1:28:48] our lives that we can be following you.
[1:28:52] And you say if we can't deny all those
[1:28:55] things, we are not worthy Lord. In other
[1:28:58] words, we cannot make it Lord, we cannot
[1:29:01] overcome the temptations before us. We
[1:29:04] cannot overcome the challenges before us
[1:29:06] if we don't deny everything and follow
[1:29:09] you Lord. We pray may give us the grace
[1:29:11] heavenly father not to debate it oh God
[1:29:14] but Lord to take the challenge right way
[1:29:18] father that we may deny everything for
[1:29:21] the sake of the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:29:23] and how the Bible told us I've crucified
[1:29:27] everything the whole world and
[1:29:29] everything that I may gain Christ help
[1:29:32] us in the name of Jesus Christ and how
[1:29:35] Paul had to put all his knowledge to be
[1:29:38] done that he may gain in Christ. He had
[1:29:40] to put his knowledge aside. He had to
[1:29:43] put his family background aside. He had
[1:29:45] to put his influence aside that he may
[1:29:47] be able to gain Christ and just became
[1:29:50] completely nothing. Oh God, we pray may
[1:29:53] help us heavenly. Father, that Lord, we
[1:29:55] may be into the hands of the porter to
[1:29:58] mold us, to make us, oh God. Father, we
[1:30:01] know when we're in your hands, you'll
[1:30:03] mold us to be vessels of God alone.
[1:30:06] vessels, oh God, where you will come and
[1:30:09] dwell in us, oh God, where you will
[1:30:11] come, heavenly father, and reveal
[1:30:13] yourself to us, where you come, heavenly
[1:30:15] father, and show us the path we have to
[1:30:17] take. Forgive us of all our sins and
[1:30:20] trespasses, Lord. Forgive us of all our
[1:30:22] failures, Lord. Help us to overcome, oh
[1:30:25] God, all our weaknesses, heavenly
[1:30:27] father, that Lord, we may live the life
[1:30:29] of Jesus Christ, waiting on you, Lord,
[1:30:32] depending upon you, Lord, glorifying and
[1:30:34] magnifying today. What a day we are
[1:30:37] living in, Lord. And how we thank you,
[1:30:39] Lord, and how we glorify holy name.
[1:30:42] Continuously make yourself known at us.
[1:30:44] Continuously reveal yourself to us.
[1:30:46] continuously show us the path that we
[1:30:49] have to take, the path of truth and
[1:30:51] righteousness. For your name's sake, oh
[1:30:53] God, we surrender ourselves unto you,
[1:30:55] Father. All that we are, Lord, we lift
[1:30:58] them all unto you. May your divine will
[1:31:00] and purpose come down to encourage us,
[1:31:03] to strengthen us, to lead us, Lord, even
[1:31:05] all along the way, and to help us to
[1:31:07] overcome all our weaknesses. Lord, how
[1:31:10] we thank the father for this evening.

[1:31:15] things that you have done. Your mercies
[1:31:17] that are new every morning. Help us dear

[1:31:42] God, bless us together, Lord. And
[1:31:44] father, even as we come to the end of
[1:31:46] this service, we pray may your presence
[1:31:47] be with us and grant us the traveling
[1:31:50] mercies as we shall be traveling home
[1:31:52] that your divine will and purpose may be
[1:31:54] done in our lives. Oh God, we love you,
[1:31:57] heavenly father. We glorify your holy
[1:31:59] name. We magnify your holy name. We
[1:32:02] honor the father and we adore you Lord.
