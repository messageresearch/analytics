[12:40] Bibles in the book of Colossians
[12:47] 3:3 we shall read out one
[12:54] verse and then we shall turn to the book
[12:58] of 2 Chronicles
[13:07] the Bible says in Colossians
[13:17] 3:3 for ye are dead and your life is hid
[13:22] with Christ in
[13:31] you are
[13:35] dead and your life is with Christ in
[13:44] God 2 chonicles
[13:51] 4 verse one
[13:59] he made an altar of
[14:01] brass 20 cubits the length thereof and
[14:06] 20 cubits the breadth thereof and 10
[14:09] cubits the height
[14:25] thereof
[14:27] verse furthermore he made the court of
[14:31] the priests and the great court and the
[14:34] doors of the court and overlay the doors
[14:37] of them with
[14:56] brass may the Lord add a blessing to his
[15:00] word we may get
[15:03] seated amen amen I want once again to
[15:06] welcome you to the word this
[15:12] evening amen amen so now we have read
[15:16] from the book of
[15:19] Colossians the position of the
[15:23] believer the position of the
[15:26] Bride is in Christ
[15:29] it's
[15:31] not that talk about the
[15:34] altars that talk about the
[15:38] courts praise the Lord that made up the
[15:42] entire
[15:44] Temple
[15:46] bu the temple of
[15:50] God from the first
[15:53] part the second
[15:56] part and the third part
[15:59] praise the Lord and now we know that
[16:02] this
[16:03] Temple consisted of three
[16:07] courts praise the Lord it had the outer
[16:11] Court it had the
[16:14] middle and
[16:18] innermost and each of those
[16:22] Courts for a
[16:25] purpose praise the Lord and each of them
[16:28] served a
[16:35] purpose and remember when when God was
[16:38] giving instructions to
[16:41] Moses in the book of
[16:44] lus how the people would be reconciled
[16:47] to
[16:49] God we see how God instructed
[16:54] Moses that if any of them
[16:59] the children of
[17:00] Israel after they had crossed
[17:03] over if any of
[17:07] them was convicted of
[17:12] sin if they were
[17:15] convicted praise the Lord they were
[17:18] given a time in a
[17:21] year to have an atonement for their
[17:26] sins so he told them
[17:29] let them get a
[17:31] Bullock and they shall bring it before
[17:33] the
[17:34] priest and they shall lay their hands
[17:36] upon the
[17:39] bulock and they shall confess their sins
[17:42] upon
[17:44] it and then the priest would
[17:49] offer The Bu for
[17:52] sacrifice unto the Lord and then the
[17:55] blood would be poured
[17:59] would be
[18:01] sprinkled as a symbol of covering the
[18:03] sins of the
[18:06] people so now in the first
[18:10] court of the temple that Solomon built
[18:13] unto the
[18:16] Lord is where the people
[18:20] gathered those that were
[18:24] convicted were gathered in
[18:26] there and the People Prayed there
[18:30] people
[18:31] fasted praise the Lords or
[18:36] Jews whoever had the call and the
[18:38] conviction
[18:41] of was gathered out there to
[18:45] pray so they brought their
[18:49] sacrifices they brought their
[18:51] Bullocks and presented it over to the
[18:56] priest praise the Lord consecrated their
[19:02] lives they put their
[19:07] lives they put their
[19:10] sins all their convictions and the
[19:12] convictions of the entire
[19:17] household upon the bulock of the
[19:20] animal and they made
[19:23] confessions praise the Lord and out
[19:26] there when they did that
[19:29] they continued in supplication and
[19:35] prayer in the outer
[19:37] Court the people were always gathered
[19:41] there were praying praise the Lord
[19:45] waiting to see if their prayers would be
[19:48] accepted of
[19:52] God and they prayed out
[19:56] there so then the priests
[20:00] they got the sacrifice and they
[20:02] sprinkled
[20:04] blood upon the
[20:07] altar praise the Lord remember it has
[20:10] started from the outer
[20:13] Court it started with conviction in the
[20:16] outer
[20:18] Court it it started with prayers in the
[20:21] outer
[20:24] Court in the outer
[20:27] Court praise the Lord
[20:29] then in the middle
[20:32] court at the
[20:35] altar blood is being
[20:38] sprinkled blood is being
[20:41] sprinkled the priest sprinkling
[20:44] blood trying to atone for the sins of
[20:47] the
[20:49] people then there was a high
[20:52] priest who was
[20:56] accepted only the high priest
[21:00] will be
[21:01] accepted praise the Lord now to get this
[21:04] Blood of the
[21:06] people and proceed over to the innermost
[21:12] Court to the holy of
[21:15] holies praise the Lord and the people
[21:18] out
[21:19] there Contin to
[21:22] pray they could they were in that moment
[21:25] of
[21:27] Supplication praise the Lord they were
[21:31] interceding while the high priest moved
[21:33] to the inner to the holy of holies with
[21:35] with their with their
[21:38] offerings while he took their prayers
[21:40] before
[21:43] God praise the Lord and when he crossed
[21:46] into the innermost
[21:50] Court he presented the prayers of the
[21:53] Saints before God
[21:58] praise the Lord and presented their
[22:00] prayers before the
[22:07] Altar and the
[22:09] altar in the innermost
[22:13] Court was built
[22:17] differently praise the Lord it has
[22:20] special
[22:22] Futures it had
[22:25] cherubims whose wings were joined around
[22:31] protecting the
[22:34] altar because in there dwell the
[22:38] presence of
[22:40] God in the holy of
[22:42] holies dwell the presence of
[22:47] God the
[22:51] seat that's
[22:53] where praise the Lord the high priest
[22:56] brought the the prayers of of the
[23:01] people laid them
[23:04] there praise the Lord to ask
[23:08] God accept the prayers of the
[23:13] people so now we see something
[23:16] here we see the
[23:18] people praise the Lord on the outside we
[23:22] see the people in the outer
[23:25] Court praying to be forgiven
[23:30] and then here is the high
[23:32] priest moved with their
[23:36] prayers from outside he gets into the
[23:39] middle court then he proceeds in the
[23:43] holy of
[23:45] holies carrying the burdens of the
[23:49] people and trying to plead with
[23:55] God to see if he would forgive the
[23:58] people
[24:01] at that
[24:02] time all the burdens of the
[24:06] people were put upon the
[24:10] priest and if God did not accept their
[24:16] prayers it meant the the life of the of
[24:20] the high priest would
[24:24] end praise the Lord so much he was
[24:27] taking their prayers
[24:30] but the enti of the people see three
[24:33] parts
[24:34] here we see the outer
[24:36] Court we see the middle
[24:39] cour and the innermost
[24:42] court and I want to say something
[24:45] here The Life of a
[24:49] Christian the life of
[24:51] anyone is composed of three elements
[24:55] praise the Lord it has the skin
[24:57] fulfilling
[25:00] it it has the
[25:03] nose and now this body
[25:06] here praise the Lord has also a
[25:10] purpose in our
[25:13] lives then we have the next
[25:17] part that is the
[25:19] spirit praise the Lord what the body has
[25:23] [Applause]
[25:25] heard the spirit meditates upon
[25:31] [Music]
[25:32] meditates upon
[25:35] it so in the
[25:38] spirit praise the Lord begins to draw
[25:47] [Music]
[25:50] contentions praise the Lord when you
[25:52] hear
[25:53] something you now take it to the
[25:56] heart and then begin to say but my heart
[25:59] was telling me
[26:02] ABCD my heart was telling me not
[26:06] go but yet you're not speaking
[26:09] out so that means there is a second part
[26:12] of
[26:14] you praise the Living God which is which
[26:18] also plays a
[26:23] part in your life praise the Lord then
[26:27] when the spirit receives
[26:30] it praise the Lord when the spirit
[26:33] accepts
[26:35] it praise the Lord now it now proceeds
[26:39] from the
[26:41] spirit and it gets now down to the
[26:44] soul praise the Lord so now depending on
[26:48] the kind of
[26:50] seed which has entered through the
[26:53] ears or through the body to the to the
[26:56] spirit
[27:00] andto the heart soul the fruits that a
[27:05] man shall
[27:07] bear depend on what they have conceived
[27:10] in their
[27:13] spirit and fed into their
[27:17] soul so now when we draw back to the
[27:21] Leviticus when the people got convicted
[27:23] of
[27:25] sin they had to confess
[27:29] so they confessed by the
[27:32] body the mouth had confessed that I have
[27:37] sinned why because their spirit is
[27:40] convicted of
[27:44] sin praise the Lord so when they
[27:48] confessed they desire to be delivered of
[27:51] their
[27:54] sin they desire to be reconciled back to
[27:57] God
[28:00] praise the Living God so now when they
[28:04] prayed their Spirit was pting to be set
[28:09] free was pting to be set
[28:13] free and I want to liken
[28:16] this to the life of a
[28:20] Believer praise the lord we know that
[28:23] when we hear the word of
[28:26] God we hear by our
[28:29] senses the bodys US to hear the
[28:32] [Applause]
[28:34] word and now the
[28:37] spirit when it receives the word from
[28:40] the
[28:41] body it begins Med upon this
[28:46] word praise the
[28:48] Lord upon the
[28:50] word and when it is convinced that it is
[28:53] the
[28:56] truth praise the
[28:58] the word now settles down in the soul of
[29:04] man and when it settles in the soul of
[29:09] man praise the Lord it now begins to
[29:12] work upon this
[29:15] man to transform
[29:18] them to make them a better
[29:21] person so man receives the word of God
[29:24] by the five senses of the body
[29:29] and when the word is received in the
[29:31] spirit or in the
[29:34] heart it then proceeds over to the
[29:38] soul and it makes in the
[29:43] soul so now remember when the high
[29:45] priest took the prayers of the
[29:50] Saints and he reached into the inner
[29:55] chamber the holy of holies
[29:58] he began to plead with God in
[30:02] there praise the Lord and now for the
[30:06] testimony to come
[30:08] out for the people to be
[30:12] convinced that their sins have been
[30:16] forgiven the high priest had to come
[30:21] back the high priest had to move
[30:25] back back from the holy of hly
[30:29] through the
[30:32] middle the where people are waiting
[30:36] from so we see two processes
[30:40] here praise the Lord the first
[30:45] process is moving from the outer
[30:50] Court through the midd
[30:53] cour to the most the inner Court
[30:58] and the second
[31:00] process is again leaving the inner the
[31:03] most inner
[31:06] Court through the middle
[31:09] court back to the outer
[31:12] court and when the people saw the high
[31:15] priest
[31:18] back they
[31:20] cated they were
[31:23] happy they knew that their prayers have
[31:25] been answered
[31:29] it was a
[31:33] testimony that God has accepted
[31:36] them that God has pardoned their their
[31:40] prayers their
[31:43] sins praise the name of the Living
[31:46] God thank you
[31:52] brother you're welcome brother amen
[31:54] bless you so now in the innermost Court
[31:59] which is typing the
[32:01] soul God is
[32:03] aboard where God
[32:06] sits where the presence of God sits in
[32:08] our
[32:10] lives praise the Lord it is a
[32:13] point praise the Lord that God has
[32:17] chosen to make an abort so when you hear
[32:21] the word of God you hear by your
[32:24] ears praise the Lord then you accept by
[32:27] your
[32:29] and when you accept the word of
[32:31] God in your heart it begins to work upon
[32:35] you it begins to prune you praise the
[32:39] Lord so now the outer coat I want call
[32:43] it the point
[32:44] ofation because that's the point where
[32:48] we are convicted of sin and we accept
[32:52] that we have
[32:53] sin and we need
[32:55] salvation that's when we get the
[32:57] offering
[32:59] come and present it to the to the the
[33:02] priest praise the Lord And now when we
[33:05] make our
[33:07] confessions because the Bible say the
[33:10] instructions that God gave unto
[33:12] Moses he says when a soul
[33:16] sin that Soul shall bring a
[33:20] bulock and when they bring a bullock
[33:24] they shall lay their hands
[33:25] upon and they shall make
[33:28] confession and then the high priest
[33:30] shall get it and they shall offer it
[33:33] unto the
[33:34] Lord praise the Lord so now that point
[33:38] where you bring the Bullock you accepted
[33:42] that you have seen and you need
[33:45] salvation that's the point of
[33:48] justification because when you bring
[33:49] your
[33:51] offering
[33:53] Justified it is taken away from you but
[33:56] it does not over
[33:58] prise the Lord even when the blood was
[34:01] sprinkled in the mid
[34:03] Court as long as the high priest has not
[34:06] entered into the in in the innermost
[34:10] Court the sins of the people have not
[34:13] been forgiven so now I want to say this
[34:17] that in the middle court is where we
[34:20] find we find
[34:23] sanctification praise the Lord the
[34:26] cleansing the blood
[34:28] of the Bullock the blood of the sheep
[34:31] and the
[34:32] animals to cover the sins of the
[34:35] people praise the Lord the blood
[34:39] covering up our
[34:40] sins praise the Lord but that's not over
[34:44] we need to go a step higher so when you
[34:48] receive the word of God praise the Lord
[34:51] you accepted it it is good but it's not
[34:55] good enough when you accept it
[34:58] and you confess it you are
[35:00] Justified praise the Lord and then when
[35:03] it gets to the to the
[35:05] heart and is doing a
[35:07] cleansing and you're being Obed to the
[35:10] word praise the Lord you allow the word
[35:13] of
[35:14] God proceed to the
[35:17] soul praise the Lord and when it gets
[35:20] into the
[35:21] soul Christ makes in
[35:24] you praise the Lord and when he makes
[35:28] in you where the life of God
[35:32] is praise the Lord it does not settle
[35:35] there praise the Lord it has to come
[35:38] from the inside
[35:41] out why it must manifest the
[35:46] fruits of the Holy Spirit to show that
[35:49] you are born of
[35:51] God that's why the high priest would not
[35:54] stay there
[35:56] forever to move
[35:58] moov from the holy of holies to the
[36:01] outer Court to manifest the
[36:04] testimony to manifest that it is
[36:07] finished praise the Lord so when you
[36:09] receive the word of God when you obey
[36:12] the word of God it gets to our
[36:15] souls again comes back from the soul
[36:21] praise the Lord because we have got a
[36:24] consolation we have been
[36:26] sealed receive the Life of Christ in
[36:30] your hearts praise the Lord you have
[36:33] received your
[36:34] seal you been forgiven and now you have
[36:37] received
[36:38] salvation praise the Lord now there
[36:42] salvation which is the life of God which
[36:45] is the word of God again comes from the
[36:49] soul to the heart make you obedience and
[36:53] it must manifest the
[36:55] outside to make the body of
[36:58] obedience the leadership of the
[37:01] spirit praise the Lord such that you are
[37:04] able to Bear the truths of the
[37:08] spirit praise the Lord why the Bible
[37:12] says that we must be a living
[37:16] episode how shall we be a living episode
[37:19] when the word is only stored in the
[37:22] soul and the life is not manifesting on
[37:25] the outside
[37:27] the Lord so the life that we have does
[37:31] not allow it to settle in the
[37:34] soul the high priest was
[37:37] excited that the prayers of the
[37:40] Saints have been accepted of God so he
[37:44] ran back and he moved to come and bring
[37:47] the
[37:47] testimony when you receive the word of
[37:50] God in your soul you must
[37:54] testify praise the Lord you must
[37:59] that the people are able to see
[38:01] Christ that the people are able to see
[38:05] and make a reference that you are born
[38:07] of Jesus Christ praise the Lord you must
[38:12] manifest The Life of Christ in you
[38:15] praise the Lord he carried the blood and
[38:19] he came back and sto the people that
[38:23] your sins have been
[38:24] forgiven praise the Lord so now the
[38:27] three
[38:29] are a
[38:30] type of the life of of the life of a
[38:34] Believer the outside
[38:37] Court where we find the
[38:39] justification and in the in the middle
[38:42] court is where we find our
[38:44] sacrifice Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[38:48] when God sent him
[38:50] down die for the sins of
[38:53] man praise the Lord the Bible says he B
[38:57] all the burdens of
[38:59] men and the Bible says he is our high
[39:03] priest praise the Lord so now he not
[39:07] just our
[39:09] sacrifice but he at the same time high
[39:13] priest praise the Lord so now when he
[39:16] bore our
[39:18] sins when he Bears our sins when he
[39:22] Bears our iniquities when he Bears all
[39:25] our transgressions
[39:27] and our
[39:28] weaknesses praise the Lord he now takes
[39:31] them over to offer himself before
[39:35] God as a sacrifice to atone for our sins
[39:40] and because to atone for
[39:42] sins there must be a symbol of
[39:46] blood blood must be
[39:48] shed that's why the animals were
[39:51] killed and the blood was poured
[39:54] upon that's why God chose Jesus the
[39:59] person of Jesus to die for the sins of
[40:03] man he had to be
[40:05] offered as a sacrifice and as a
[40:09] sacrifice he
[40:11] had to pour his own
[40:14] blood praise the Lord and when he poured
[40:17] his own blood blood cleanses us that
[40:21] blood covers all
[40:23] our cleanses all our
[40:26] weakness and out of the blood of Jesus
[40:30] Christ out of the blood of
[40:33] Jesus proceeded a
[40:35] life praise the Lord they proceeded the
[40:39] life the life of God the life of God
[40:43] came out of the blood of
[40:45] Jesus and now when the life came out of
[40:48] it the life was given to each one of
[40:52] us praise the Lord it was given to each
[40:55] one of us
[40:57] life what settles in our
[41:01] souls and then you get that life which
[41:04] is the word of God when you get that
[41:07] life which is the Life of Christ in your
[41:11] life you have eternal life and you have
[41:15] found your
[41:16] position in Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[41:20] that's why in colians
[41:23] 3: at that
[41:26] point you are dead praise the Lord you
[41:30] are dead
[41:31] yourself and now your
[41:34] life is he in
[41:37] Christ why when you receive the word of
[41:40] God and you're
[41:42] Justified proceeds to your
[41:45] heart and begins pruning you prise the
[41:48] Lord you begin to reject your
[41:51] life you begin to reject your
[41:54] desires in other words you're becoming
[41:57] dead
[41:58] yourself and you allowing that life of
[42:02] God that life of Jesus Christ to take
[42:06] over your
[42:07] life praise the Lord And now when you
[42:10] are fully
[42:12] clean he gives you that life the life
[42:16] that proceeds out of the blood of Jesus
[42:20] Christ and that life comes and settles
[42:23] in the
[42:24] soul and once the life is given in your
[42:28] soul the word settles in your
[42:31] soul you have
[42:34] salvation why it is the seal the B calls
[42:38] it the
[42:39] seal the day of our
[42:42] Redemption praise the Lord so believing
[42:46] God
[42:47] confessing is good it's not good enough
[42:52] because it does not save your soul the
[42:55] word which we have received
[42:57] must enter into our hearts and penetrate
[43:00] to the soul and make an AB there that's
[43:05] when you receive the life of
[43:06] God praise the lord and there is no
[43:09] human being that ever receive the life
[43:12] of
[43:14] God you will ever set
[43:16] home praise the Lord you become
[43:20] Restless you need to show what you have
[43:23] believed once that life is born in your
[43:26] life
[43:28] praise the Lord you want to show someone
[43:31] else what you have received that's why
[43:35] you must testify
[43:38] again
[43:39] tesy does not mean we shall go all of us
[43:42] and
[43:43] preach praise the Lord the life that you
[43:47] live itself testifies of the goodness of
[43:51] the
[43:52] lord of the Salvation of God
[43:57] allow God to take over your life you
[44:00] become dead
[44:02] yourself and your life is hid behind CHR
[44:07] and Christ himself come
[44:09] out comes out to live your life that's
[44:14] says your life is hidden
[44:17] Christ with
[44:19] Christ why because when you he died he
[44:23] picked his life and he gave it over to
[44:25] you so now got your life and he put it
[44:29] behind his life that he himself may be
[44:33] manifested in your
[44:34] life praise the name Living God and now
[44:38] he gives us
[44:40] promises praise the Lord when he has
[44:42] given us a part
[44:44] of when he has given us his life through
[44:48] the blood of Jesus
[44:50] Christ which she poured upon the
[44:53] cross which cleanses us daily
[44:57] of our
[44:58] Sports praise the Lord he gives us the
[45:02] Assurance of
[45:04] rest to rest and allow God to take
[45:09] over so you rest of
[45:12] yourself in other words we become
[45:15] dead and we must be
[45:18] dead for Christ to
[45:21] manifest praise the Lord the animal had
[45:24] to be dead
[45:27] blood to come
[45:28] out Jesus had to die on the
[45:31] cross and his blood had to come out of
[45:36] his for us to receive the life out of
[45:39] the
[45:40] blood praise the Lord and we have that
[45:44] Assurance the Assurance of Eternal
[45:48] rest because the life of God which is
[45:52] eternal life dwells in our souls and as
[45:56] as long as it dwells in
[45:59] Us Praise the Lord as long as God dwells
[46:02] in
[46:03] us we find our positions in
[46:07] Christ we don't find our positions in
[46:09] the
[46:10] church we don't find our positions in
[46:13] anywhere
[46:14] else we find our
[46:17] position in Christ how because when he
[46:21] took over our
[46:22] lives the day we
[46:24] con the day we are ConEd
[46:29] confessed praise the Lord he took us up
[46:34] praise the Lord and then presented
[46:36] himself as a
[46:37] sacrifice to die for all our
[46:40] sins and the Bible says all our sins are
[46:45] now
[46:46] forgotten all our weaknesses are now
[46:50] forgotten why because Christ Came Upon
[46:54] Our
[46:55] confession and he took took over our
[46:57] lives and he put our lives behind
[47:00] him and presented himself upon the
[47:04] cross as a
[47:06] sacrifice out of the
[47:08] cross out of his
[47:10] blood came the life that we
[47:13] live out of that
[47:16] sacrifice came the word of
[47:18] God his life unto our
[47:21] soul praise the Lord that is the word
[47:26] that is the spoken
[47:28] the gospel of peace the eternal life
[47:32] himself that proceeds from the life of
[47:35] God
[47:37] himself to the
[47:39] soul of man and once it is there it
[47:44] seals us and gives us the
[47:47] Assurance to rest until the day of our
[47:51] Redemption so shall the people
[47:53] know that you are my disciples
[47:58] why because you have my
[48:01] life you are in me and I am in you
[48:06] Christ in you and you in Christ the hope
[48:10] of glory praise the Lord and once we
[48:14] have the
[48:15] testimony once we have the testimony of
[48:17] the life of
[48:19] God we have the Assurance to
[48:23] overcome praise the Lord you rest
[48:27] it does not mean we shall not get into
[48:30] distress distress will
[48:33] come but you have the Assurance of
[48:36] over because Jesus overcame the
[48:40] world and if he lives in you you have
[48:43] also overcome the
[48:45] world praise the lord the devil may try
[48:48] to
[48:50] manifest he may try to
[48:53] condemn and bring condemnations
[48:57] praise the Lord but we have the
[48:59] assurance that as long as we in Christ
[49:02] there is now no
[49:05] condemnation praise the Lord all sins
[49:07] are
[49:08] forgiven all sports are
[49:11] cleansed Life of Christ we have a
[49:15] testimony that we have Christ we have a
[49:19] testimony that we have received
[49:22] him praise the name Living
[49:24] God and now remember when Jesus was
[49:28] moving
[49:29] over he did not bear
[49:32] some but he B all our
[49:38] bur part of
[49:41] your all our
[49:44] sin all our
[49:47] iniquities all
[49:49] burdens anything that Satan will rise
[49:53] before us
[49:57] us Christ carried it
[49:59] over praise the Lord that's why at some
[50:03] point when he was taking the
[50:06] sacrifice he knew that himself was the
[50:10] sacrifice and he was moving
[50:12] over as was reaching the
[50:15] altar when the sacrifice was to be
[50:19] offered he saw himself
[50:21] there being
[50:23] sacrificed and the burdens were so heavy
[50:28] when he looked down when he looked back
[50:32] from eternity and he saw all the
[50:35] sins that man had committed from Adam
[50:39] praise the Lord and then he looked a far
[50:43] off to see all our
[50:45] bur all our
[50:47] challenges every sin that we would go
[50:51] through and he brought all of them
[50:55] together became very
[50:57] heavy he say God I be in
[51:01] position to carry this
[51:03] over praise the Lord and he cried out to
[51:07] God and say if it is
[51:09] possible let this
[51:11] cup be taken away from me praise the
[51:15] Lord he was the
[51:17] sacrifice that God was
[51:19] offering then he looked at himself and
[51:23] the way that he was
[51:24] carrying says is
[51:27] heav is
[51:29] possible manage to
[51:31] overc then Christ heard the voice of
[51:35] God and God showed him the
[51:39] purpose etal purpose of
[51:41] God and when Christ heard the voice of
[51:45] God it is my
[51:47] will and my good
[51:50] pleasure I present you a as a perfect
[51:55] sacrifice for the sins of
[51:58] people that they may be reconciled back
[52:01] to
[52:02] me then he says father not my will but
[52:07] let your will be
[52:09] done praise the Lord he yeld the will of
[52:13] God praise the Lord in the middle
[52:16] court we yield to the will of
[52:19] God that point of of of of of
[52:24] cleansing that point of sanctification
[52:27] when we are being
[52:28] Sanctified we must yield to the will of
[52:32] God praise the Lord and say father this
[52:36] seems be too
[52:38] much let your will be
[52:41] done it is in his good pleasure that we
[52:45] get to that point praise the Lord and
[52:48] the prophet says that at at some
[52:52] time God allows us to come to that
[52:57] point that you may get into a deeper
[53:00] relationship and fellowship with
[53:03] God Can
[53:06] Jesus father I know it is too heavy for
[53:09] me to
[53:10] carry but let your will be
[53:14] done and when Christ did that the will
[53:17] of God took
[53:19] over and when we do that we will make
[53:22] that
[53:23] confession and know that whatever we are
[53:28] is for us we
[53:32] surrender I recogize your work in me I
[53:36] recognize your presence in my
[53:39] life and I want your will to be
[53:42] done now let God exalt
[53:46] himself above the
[53:49] weaknesses you allow God to exalt
[53:52] himself above your
[53:54] iniquities even when the brings them
[53:58] up as a
[54:00] condemnation you reference the words and
[54:03] say but Christ said when he died upon
[54:06] the cross there shall be no more
[54:10] condemnation because all my
[54:12] condemnation was put upon
[54:15] Him Father let your will be
[54:18] done God says move on it is my will that
[54:24] I present you as a sacrifice
[54:27] move
[54:28] on strike the mark of your
[54:31] call moments like that recognize your
[54:35] position in
[54:36] Christ and move
[54:38] forward and
[54:41] recognize that Christ is there present
[54:44] with you why because he made a
[54:47] promise
[54:49] toed accepted the words and he gave you
[54:53] a part of it so if he has given me part
[54:56] of him he is with you and your life not
[55:01] a part of your life but your life is
[55:05] with him praise the Lord so when the
[55:08] devil begins to move
[55:10] around when the adversary moving
[55:13] around look for whom to
[55:16] conquer Christ is present with
[55:18] you when you get
[55:21] afraid of what has happened you say God
[55:25] I know you're with me
[55:27] manifest yourself you confess why you
[55:32] recogize your position in Christ and
[55:36] know that it is no longer you that is
[55:40] living because your life you got dead
[55:45] praise the Lord you died and God Christ
[55:49] himself is the one leaving when you now
[55:54] come to that point
[55:57] and he say father I know I am going
[55:59] through this I have this
[56:02] weakness but I know you gave me a
[56:06] promise I di to
[56:08] myself praise the Lord I am dead and I
[56:12] know that I am dead come manifest
[56:16] yourself then he rises up he comes up
[56:21] and anyhow you may not know how you've
[56:23] overcome
[56:26] gives you the
[56:27] victory why you have recognized your
[56:32] position in him that's all he demands of
[56:35] us organize our
[56:38] position praise the Lord in every moment
[56:40] of Life
[56:43] recognize that your life is in Christ
[56:47] that your life is hidden with Christ so
[56:50] if your life is hidden with
[56:53] Christ What then shall we say
[56:57] What then shall we
[56:58] say about these things that's what Paul
[57:02] says in the Book of Romans chter 8se
[57:07] 31 around 38 What then shall we
[57:11] say these things what shall we say when
[57:16] they come up what shall we say Christ
[57:21] died Christ came and he died for our sin
[57:26] blood is still
[57:29] flesh upon the altar praise the Lord you
[57:33] recognize that the blood is still flesh
[57:36] upon the so when the enemy takes you to
[57:41] fall you look back to the
[57:44] Altar and say the blood is still flesh
[57:47] upon the altar then you run to the Altar
[57:51] and
[57:52] present praise the Lord you present
[57:55] yourself I say Here I Am wash me Father
[58:00] your blood is still flesh upon cleans me
[58:05] the enemy has brought this
[58:08] spot cleans me why he leaves his blood
[58:13] there because it is in his
[58:16] promises that he must present
[58:20] us as a church that must not have any
[58:24] wrinkles
[58:27] do not have any sports so when the
[58:29] sports fall in our lives you back to him
[58:34] I say father I
[58:36] recognize my position in you and I know
[58:40] that your
[58:41] blood he still is still flesh and your
[58:45] grace is still sufficient to cleanse me
[58:48] of my
[58:50] spot then when you confess when you
[58:53] speak to him he is very
[58:56] F to forgive praise the Lord if it is a
[59:00] moment of
[59:02] difficulty he said father is a difficult
[59:06] moment it is a difficult moment for me
[59:09] to
[59:10] overcome yet I
[59:12] know that you overcame the
[59:15] world and because you overcame the
[59:18] world I also
[59:20] overcome why he took all our
[59:24] B through the cross praise the Lord what
[59:28] we have to do recognize your position in
[59:33] the word and confess and wait on the
[59:37] Lord praise the Lord he says his blood
[59:40] is still
[59:41] flesh to help us overcome

[1:12:20] that's where our position is praise the
[1:12:22] Lord the world may look for wealth
[1:12:27] the world may look for all whatever it
[1:12:29] can
[1:12:33] afford Bri their position is not in the
[1:12:37] wealth of the world their position is in
[1:12:41] Christ Jesus their position is in the
[1:12:44] word of
[1:12:46] God praise the Lord and as long as our
[1:12:50] position in the Lord we shall get all
[1:12:54] the wealth
[1:12:56] that we
[1:12:57] desire because it is a promise the
[1:13:01] source of
[1:13:02] wealth and we have followed his
[1:13:06] wording our
[1:13:08] position the rest of the things shall
[1:13:12] follow let's make
[1:13:15] confession and let us believe we are
[1:13:19] dead in Christ Jesus and we become new
[1:13:23] creatures all things are passed away the
[1:13:27] blood cleanses
[1:13:28] us and washes away
[1:13:31] all and gives us a new
[1:13:34] life therefore If any man be in
[1:13:39] Christ he is a new
[1:13:41] cre all things are passed away behold
[1:13:45] All Things become
[1:13:46] new even if the adversary comes
[1:13:50] in there is no
[1:13:52] condemnation that can be put
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:57] to them that are in Christ who walk not
[1:14:00] after the
[1:14:01] flesh but after the will of God after
[1:14:05] the will of the spirit and the prophet
[1:14:07] says now if we can find our
[1:14:10] oppos and know that it is God's
[1:14:14] word that has promised it oh that
[1:14:18] settles
[1:14:19] it you know he's talked about
[1:14:22] us throughout the scriptures
[1:14:25] he has talked about us there is a bride
[1:14:29] and this bride shall not have any spot
[1:14:32] or
[1:14:34] wrink that settles it the bride shall
[1:14:39] not have spot you look at your spot you
[1:14:44] cast it upon the
[1:14:45] Lord you look at your
[1:14:47] weaknesses Get It cast it upon the Lord
[1:14:51] for he
[1:14:52] cares wash us make us clean and present
[1:14:57] us before him praise the Lord you get
[1:15:01] bured into his
[1:15:03] word you get buried into his
[1:15:07] what which form your thoughts and
[1:15:12] imaginations and finally form a
[1:15:15] character the character of the Lord
[1:15:18] Jesus that's why when you receive the
[1:15:21] word and it has made an AB in your soul
[1:15:25] the word then makes its way
[1:15:28] out to manifest the character of
[1:15:32] Christ praise the Lord and we become a
[1:15:35] living
[1:15:36] episode to which men make
[1:15:39] references that's the reason Joshua and
[1:15:43] C had no fear that they could not take
[1:15:47] the promised
[1:15:49] land because all the rest of
[1:15:52] them said we can't do it
[1:15:56] why those cities are World
[1:15:59] high and we look like grasshoppers
[1:16:09] upside
[1:16:12] arm and said we just can't do
[1:16:16] it they were looking at the sense of
[1:16:19] reason they were still at the outer
[1:16:23] Court they were still being by the outer
[1:16:26] Court they had not recognized their
[1:16:30] position in Christ praise the Lord but
[1:16:33] jhua
[1:16:34] and they had the
[1:16:37] Revelation they had received the
[1:16:40] instruction had received the promises
[1:16:43] and the word had made an AB in their
[1:16:45] hearts and it was in their souls and
[1:16:48] they were
[1:16:49] convinced that the word which was on the
[1:16:52] side of them had the part over
[1:16:57] no we can overcome we shall take up the
[1:17:01] land because it is the promise
[1:17:04] recognizing your position in Christ you
[1:17:09] can claim Every
[1:17:12] Blessing there is in the
[1:17:15] word once you recogize and appreciate
[1:17:18] your
[1:17:19] position in Christ says and the
[1:17:22] revelation of God
[1:17:25] had brought the word of God
[1:17:27] manifested and now they was
[1:17:30] ready to push into the promised
[1:17:33] land they reced their position took
[1:17:37] their stand and believed God believe
[1:17:41] every
[1:17:42] promise and that
[1:17:45] settled you don't have to worry
[1:17:48] about take up your position you have
[1:17:51] belied you have the words you have the
[1:17:55] Assurance of the life of God in you if
[1:17:58] you have the Assurance you take your
[1:18:01] position in Christ and that
[1:18:04] settles every promise in the book is
[1:18:09] mine praise the Lord every promise in
[1:18:12] the Bible is mine when you get to a need
[1:18:17] you reference the scriptures and you
[1:18:19] find that promise there I say God every
[1:18:23] promise in this book is mine I take up
[1:18:28] this promise and you believe it no
[1:18:31] matter how long it
[1:18:33] takes that settles it just keep
[1:18:37] believing and you surrender it over unto
[1:18:41] the Lord for he cares he shall sustain
[1:18:45] us cast all your cares upon the
[1:18:49] Lord sustain you shall not let the right
[1:18:53] suffer
[1:18:55] praise the Lord I wish I had time I will
[1:18:58] tell you a simple testimony let me give
[1:19:00] it you in five minutes praise the Lord
[1:19:04] one time I was in school in high
[1:19:07] school in my
[1:19:10] level and I was I was a head boy and at
[1:19:14] the same time the leader in the
[1:19:16] scpt so now one time I was preaching on
[1:19:20] Su and then the B comes in
[1:19:25] the school had just changed
[1:19:27] management and now those that were there
[1:19:30] had
[1:19:31] left and I was on
[1:19:33] scholarship they given me a scholarship
[1:19:35] in the school so now the B comes in and
[1:19:39] she was on
[1:19:40] trousers she was on
[1:19:43] trousers and I was I was
[1:19:46] preaching about Christ and and and his
[1:19:49] wife Christ and bright I never mentioned
[1:19:53] about anything to do with trouser
[1:19:56] but the woman got so
[1:19:58] convicted and she was so
[1:20:02] pissed yes when she moved out she
[1:20:07] brought other people from the
[1:20:10] fellowship my fellow leaders in the
[1:20:13] scripture and she asked them what I
[1:20:17] believe and what I have been preaching
[1:20:20] and some of them we have been with them
[1:20:23] from senior one
[1:20:25] up Senor six and I had preached to them
[1:20:29] all the
[1:20:31] way they told her but he believes what
[1:20:35] we believe and she told them that man
[1:20:40] has a
[1:20:43] weird it is so
[1:20:46] weird and it is wrong and he should be
[1:20:49] careful so they never believed her so
[1:20:53] they said make
[1:20:56] programs and I am going to become your
[1:20:58] your your like your
[1:21:01] leader
[1:21:03] Patron over so she began dictating who
[1:21:07] should
[1:21:08] preach and now when the people
[1:21:11] demanded the rest of the school sto
[1:21:15] fellowshipping because of what the
[1:21:16] preachers were preaching so I got back
[1:21:20] and started
[1:21:21] preaching and when I preached she got
[1:21:24] conviced
[1:21:26] she stopped
[1:21:28] felling and now she got a click of
[1:21:31] people to start conspiring against me
[1:21:34] and now because I was in
[1:21:36] scholarship and she was a school B and
[1:21:39] the sister to the own of the the new own
[1:21:42] of the
[1:21:43] school she took a wrong information to
[1:21:47] director and the director
[1:21:50] came looking for me this was a honorable
[1:21:54] man
[1:21:56] Minister and he he came with the
[1:21:59] army they were looking for me and they
[1:22:02] didn't know so around 7
[1:22:06] p.m. so as I was in class they sent they
[1:22:10] sent for me so when I reached the man
[1:22:14] wanted to slap me then he looked at me
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:19] then the the soldier said first first
[1:22:22] leave him so now they interrogated
[1:22:25] me and they found I had no
[1:22:28] problem so now they called
[1:22:31] the and they asked them but he said this
[1:22:34] man wants to burn the
[1:22:36] school that's the information they gave
[1:22:39] simply killed my influence they by
[1:22:43] killing my
[1:22:44] influence they would kill the influence
[1:22:46] of the word of God in the
[1:22:49] school because the director was a
[1:22:52] Muslim so now they started
[1:22:55] surpressing our fellowship now it came
[1:22:59] to pass that when they
[1:23:01] failed she now went through the
[1:23:06] books and now she said this man has not
[1:23:08] been paying school
[1:23:10] fees I will make sure that he pays all
[1:23:13] the school fees that
[1:23:15] he for the whole year and it was second
[1:23:19] time so she now sends a sheet
[1:23:24] me around
[1:23:26] 780 it was mock time so in mock she came
[1:23:30] and says go home and bring the money so
[1:23:33] I went home and there was no money so I
[1:23:36] stayed home so as I was at home I heard
[1:23:41] that the Lev students were
[1:23:44] demonstrating Lev
[1:23:46] students they were
[1:23:48] demonstrating they refused to go to
[1:23:51] class they refused to go to class used
[1:23:54] to eat
[1:23:55] food why because they had sent me out of
[1:23:59] school and now I was wondering my being
[1:24:02] at home how is it concerning them but we
[1:24:07] didn't know that the life of God that
[1:24:11] was in Us Praise the Lord the character
[1:24:14] of Christ had an influence in the
[1:24:18] school and now when I was there the
[1:24:22] teacher sent
[1:24:25] they called my parents and I went back
[1:24:27] to school I reached school at around 7
[1:24:31] p.m. I found
[1:24:35] soldiers again they had put soldiers at
[1:24:38] the
[1:24:39] gate and when they saw me these other
[1:24:42] Gat men told the soldiers he the one
[1:24:46] they said you not going
[1:24:48] anywhere so I went and I slept at the
[1:24:52] Neighbors in the school
[1:24:54] the following morning as I was going in
[1:24:57] they stopped me I went back home that
[1:25:01] afternoon the school
[1:25:04] demonstrated and now when
[1:25:06] demonstrated the information reached the
[1:25:09] the
[1:25:10] minister you see what we were telling
[1:25:12] you the head boy wants to burn the
[1:25:17] school again when they now they they
[1:25:21] called me to come in interrogate me and
[1:25:25] as the whole school was seated in
[1:25:28] the the cang was where students normally
[1:25:33] gather then they we saw a
[1:25:37] vehicle like around four vehicles coming
[1:25:40] in with the police kind of
[1:25:43] escort they rushed and stopped then I
[1:25:46] knew it was all about me because it had
[1:25:49] happened before so now they called me
[1:25:52] again and they start interrogating
[1:25:55] and say people are
[1:25:56] demonstrating you are leading
[1:25:59] demonstration true
[1:26:01] youo and they said if I want bur the
[1:26:04] school truth shall come
[1:26:07] out and they sent me out of the school
[1:26:11] and I went back home then third time I
[1:26:15] was not in school I came back the day of
[1:26:20] briefing they never gave me the
[1:26:22] ID now at night they had sent me out
[1:26:26] again the girls that we are put together
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:31] school throughout the time I was there
[1:26:34] they sent for me one of them was a
[1:26:38] Pentecostal and then they said we have
[1:26:40] made
[1:26:41] consultation and we find that you are
[1:26:44] not having any
[1:26:45] problem but the issue is with your
[1:26:49] faith it seems What You Preach upsets
[1:26:53] the big woman
[1:26:55] and so she has
[1:26:56] conspired to make sure that you don't
[1:27:00] preach in this
[1:27:01] school it has nothing to do with your
[1:27:03] school Fe nothing do with with
[1:27:07] demonstration so they called me in at
[1:27:10] around 1
[1:27:13] a.m. I got a neighbor where I was
[1:27:16] sleeping so they made me enter I said go
[1:27:20] and sit in that room and read
[1:27:25] it was a Sunday night and the following
[1:27:27] day there was a paper so when the
[1:27:29] Learners knew that I was
[1:27:31] around they all came to help discuss for
[1:27:35] them as we were discussing power went
[1:27:39] off when went off the man who was put in
[1:27:43] the
[1:27:44] school watch over the school as a
[1:27:47] manager was a
[1:27:49] drunkard so he came around and said I
[1:27:53] have smelled
[1:27:55] the of Wilson
[1:27:58] here here and you are hiding come out I
[1:28:03] have something to tell you I'm not going
[1:28:06] to suspend you to chase you out I was
[1:28:09] hiding then I came out of Darkness he
[1:28:12] says I want to tell you young man they
[1:28:15] have told us all sorts of
[1:28:17] things they have told us they have bed
[1:28:20] the mind of the director
[1:28:24] but we now know what the reason is you
[1:28:27] have a star around
[1:28:29] you and that star is always burning
[1:28:32] around
[1:28:33] you and each time I am
[1:28:36] sleeping I am restless because of you
[1:28:39] they said you're not going to sit for
[1:28:41] exams but I'm telling you as the manager
[1:28:44] of the
[1:28:45] school tomorrow morning I am going to
[1:28:48] give you your ID and you must go into
[1:28:51] the papers you have a star around you
[1:28:54] and I want know where you got that
[1:28:56] stuff and we were all speechless the man
[1:29:00] was drunk but he was
[1:29:02] speak so the following morning people go
[1:29:05] to the
[1:29:06] parate they enter the exam the B refuses
[1:29:09] to give me the after one hour the man
[1:29:12] comes and finds me out I said you must
[1:29:15] sit he went the office pick the he gave
[1:29:19] me but the first time you never allowed
[1:29:21] me in
[1:29:24] allowed me in and I have a testimony
[1:29:27] that in one hour God allowed me to get a
[1:29:30] B in that
[1:29:32] paper and now after struggling and
[1:29:37] struggling at the end of the day the
[1:29:40] woman came and she confessed and says I
[1:29:44] am sorry but because of what he used to
[1:29:47] preach is what upset me and I didn't
[1:29:51] want you to be the
[1:29:52] school you the spirit of a
[1:29:56] cult a
[1:30:00] cult and I I told her I told her I Don't
[1:30:05] Preach anything
[1:30:06] else but I preach the word of God and I
[1:30:10] assure you that this testimony of the
[1:30:13] words shall continue whether am there or
[1:30:18] I am not there and I thank God that the
[1:30:21] script of that year
[1:30:24] all of them
[1:30:26] believed all of them most of them were
[1:30:29] Kenyans but all of them believed and all
[1:30:32] of them are fellowshipping in
[1:30:34] church and I didn't pray for her to
[1:30:38] suffer but that very
[1:30:41] was and I found her
[1:30:43] selling so when I found her selling
[1:30:47] in I lowered down my my
[1:30:50] glasses and I went said Madame I'm sorry
[1:30:53] but I just want to say
[1:30:55] then she made a statement and says I am
[1:30:59] sorry I persecuted you but because
[1:31:03] because of you I am suffering and I
[1:31:06] remember there was a
[1:31:08] teacher who was a believer in the he was
[1:31:11] called
[1:31:12] Mr he made a quote he quoted and says I
[1:31:17] am telling you I told people never touch
[1:31:21] the Lord's anointed
[1:31:24] and I looked at him and he said Whoever
[1:31:27] touched
[1:31:29] you when you were in school is going to
[1:31:32] pay unless they come and repent to
[1:31:35] God have to assure
[1:31:38] you most of
[1:31:40] them recognized that I wasn't against
[1:31:43] the school even the director when
[1:31:47] results came and he heard that the child
[1:31:50] who was being
[1:31:51] persecuted is again the best the school
[1:31:54] and has teacher in the
[1:31:56] district he rushed to come and he wanted
[1:31:59] to see me but that time I also never
[1:32:02] appeared and he left a message behind
[1:32:06] and said you tell him I am sorry because
[1:32:10] he raised the hand upon
[1:32:12] me he said he was also so
[1:32:15] Restless unfortunately he lost the
[1:32:19] seat he lost the
[1:32:21] seat as a member of Parliament
[1:32:25] also as a minister and it is so
[1:32:28] surprising that right now he's going
[1:32:30] through a terrible
[1:32:32] life the word of God that we have
[1:32:36] received has
[1:32:38] power the testim that we are
[1:32:41] carrying it has power and we have this
[1:32:45] testimony we have seen the Lord working
[1:32:48] the life that is on the inside of us
[1:32:51] that is a living test on the outside
[1:32:54] the devil may rise up against it but we
[1:32:57] have a promise that he that is in US is
[1:33:02] greater than he that is in the
[1:33:04] world we are more than
[1:33:06] conquerors in every
[1:33:08] situation we are more than
[1:33:11] conquerors you stand on the word of God
[1:33:14] you confess the word of God and I want
[1:33:17] to assure you friends that throughout
[1:33:20] that time from second time to third time
[1:33:24] I never attended any class but God gave
[1:33:27] me Grace and I scored very good
[1:33:31] grace any child who attended
[1:33:34] classes why because God gave us a
[1:33:38] promise praise the Lord if he's in us he
[1:33:42] shall protect us praise the Lord he
[1:33:44] shall provide for us cast all your B

[1:34:04] wasn't worried and I am not worried
[1:34:08] because he who I have believed is more
