The disciples were getting the wind started violently blowing but he was asleep in the stand. Does he not care that we perish? We are helpless and we are so afraid. Jesus arose when they called him and said to them, "Where is your faith? Because you prayed, oh night you've held on with all of your might. God your cries have awoken the master. [Music] Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Your cries have awoken thy master. [Music] It hit you without any warning. The storms of your life had begun. Seeing no hope in the distance, you're frightened with nohere to run. And by now, your vessel is feeling. And you're thinking that you will surely drown. You've cried out for help from the Savior and you know you can't give up now because you prayed all night and you've held on with all of your might. Sh your Christ have woken the master [Music] for he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Child, your cries have awoken. the master. [Music] It hit you without any warning. The storms of your life had begun. Seeing no hope in the distance, your frightened were nowhere to run. And by now your vessel is feeling and you're thinking that you will surely drown. You cried out for help from the Savior. And you know you can't give up now because you prayed all night. Because you've held on with all of your might. Child, your cries have awoken the master. [Music] Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. child. Your cries have awoken the master. [Music] You're up there worried that he's fast asleep. The winds are so deadly. The waters so deep. But try to be patient cuz sin will bring peace. Just one word from his voice and it all will cease because you pray all night cuz you held on with all of your might. Without your Christ, I've awoken the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Child, your cries. I've awoken the master. Oh, he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice. Cuz child, your cries have awoken. A master child, your cries have awoken the master. [Applause] [Music] God bless you. Amen. They prayed all night. They prayed all night and the storms were beating on the boat. They had to wake up the master. Amen. Amen. And you know when he woke up, he proved he was the master of the sea. In all your problems, in all your trials, remember the one who first of all circumstances is not from you. Just turn a little bit and say, "Master, we perish." He will raise and take over the situation. Amen. Amen. So we are happy to be here tonight before the presence of the Lord where two or three are gathered together. You see the one thing is two. The minimum is two. And you know the two come together because every one of them is connected to the master. Amen. Amen. So he's not just here but is here in his name. In his name. Amen. The character, the nature, everything. If we have two or three in that character, in that nature this morning, then nothing shall stand before us. Amen. Not even. Amen. Are you gathered in his name?

So that's somehow uh so uh uh if it is here in different other places and it's sometimes very amazing how God brings people together and if I see that God brings you together I know there is a reason and a purpose for There's people that you meet in your life that God ordained. Amen. For a purpose. Amen. Amen. And I believe, the bride of Jesus Christ is meeting together for a purpose. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. So, just want to appreciate and And I take my time also for saying thank you for all the prayers, for all your prayers, and for everything that you have done to further the gospel. We see the current world events. So many things have been fulfilled. Brother Brandham spoke of. Amen. Amen. The prophet would let us know there would come a pope out of the United States. And here we are. We understand how close we are. We see what is going on worldwide. Amen. The time is there. The time of the change is very close. And one of these days our bodies will be changed. This mortality will put on immortality. Isn't that wonderful? It's not just a dream. It will happen in our day. This is the hour for it. And we are here on earth to be part of it. What a what a great time. And as also I want to say thank you for the special for the for the singing. As a minister, you are always careful. You just want to see the Holy Spirit leading. Amen. Amen. And so I'm so grateful as the sisters were singing and the brothers. It's so simple. But you understand, we are called for prayer. Amen. Amen. And as they were sitting with Jesus in the boat, they had to wake him up. They had to wake him up. It was not magic what they needed to do. just the necessary, wake him up. So you don't have to do magic to bring him on the scene. Just do the things that is necessary. Just wake him up. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So wonderful joining in with what the Lord put on my heart. Hallelujah. So we I I we we know that the Lord is already present that the Lord has something in store for us. Amen. I just want to see that not only in the ministry. I want to see the move of God amongst the people, amongst each and every one of us because this is a body move. Amen. Amen. The rapture is a body move. We all will be changed. Not just only one or two or three. We all shall be changed. This is what Paul told us. Not only a few here and there, Paul said, "We all shall be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye." So that's why I need you and you need me for our bodies to be changed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we want to use the time we have to prepare ourselves. The prophet would say that is the duty of the bride to close herself be because she was arraigned in fine linen but the Bible says the bride had made herself ready. Amen. Amen. The bride has made herself and we want to take this morning the garment of the word and put it on. Do we want to put it on this morning? Put it on means you accept what God gives you. It's wonderful to hold it, but that's not enough. You have to accept it. You have to accept what God has done for you. Calvary has happened. You have to accept what God has done for you. As you accept it, this means you put it on. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you. Amen. Uh let us stand together for the reading of the words. And we want to read three scriptures. Amen. Very known scriptures. Uh actually a year ago, a year ago, I was touching on the same points and I want to speak touch on it again. This time a little bit in a different approach. Amen. Because the word is unfolding. Is that right? The word is unfolding. It's the same Bible, but it's a new book. That means it's more unfolding. Amen. Amen. Do you see Jesus Christ? In every scripture, if you don't see him, the prophet say go and read it again because he's there. And Jesus Christ is not alone this morning. If you read the scripture and you don't see yourself in this, read it again. Amen. Amen. Genesis 15. Genesis 15. And I want to speak this morning on Jesus Christ the same. Jesus Christ the same today. Amen. Amen. Do you believe he's the same today? Do you believe Jesus Christ is the same today? Amen. Amen. Amen. Jesus Christ is the same today. Genesis 15:1-6. It's about Abraham. After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision, saying, "Fear not, Abraham. I'm thy shield, and that is exceeding great reward. [Music] [Music] Amen. Just only one verse after these things. If we understand here Abraham had done something and Abraham need to do something as we as the sisters were were singing in the song. You have to wake him up. You have to wake him up. Amen. Can we say amen to that? Now here the Bible said after these things. So obviously Abraham had done something and after Abraham had done something, God came to him in a vision. Amen. So it's so important that we understand what God wants us to do in this. You have to awaken and then he speaks to the storm. You have to awake him and then he takes over. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's go to Genesis 18:1-9. Very very amazing scripture. And so simple and I trust you you watch carefully. Watch Abraham here. Genesis 18 1 1-9. And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Me as he said in the tent door in the heat of the day. [Music] And he lift up his eyes and looked. And lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground. and said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant, [Music] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your heart, your hearts. After that ye shall pass on, for therefore are you come to your servant." And they said, "So do as thou has said. [Music] Now, now watch what Abraham is doing now. I just just so simple, but watch what Abraham is doing now. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said, "Make ready quickly free measures of fine meal needed, and make cake upon the earth. [Music] [Music] And Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man. He hasted to dress it. [Music] Amen. Amen. And he took butter and milk and cow which he had dressed and set it before them and they stood by under the tree and they did eat. [Music] And they said unto him, "Where is Sarah, thy wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the tent." [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand? You have to wake him. You have to wake him. Then he comes and takes over. Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord? This morning you have to wake him. This morning you have to call him in your life. This morning you have to do something for him to do the rest. Let's turn one more scripture. Hebrews 13 verse 8 [Music] verse 8. It's a very very strange sentence. [Music] Amen. You ready? We just only want to read that verse. And while reading it, you will recognize that words cannot stand alone. That verse is a result. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. Let's say that together. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, We thank you for your grace and mercy. Thank you for all that you have done. Take thy servant, Father, I pray, take him aside and anoint him for service, the words of eternal eternal life will come forth and that the atmosphere is can can be created that it is pleasing unto you. Father we pray. Take every wrong thing under control. Inspire us. Help us so that you you can reveal yourself amongst us. Father, all what we do. All what we say shall be to your honor and to your glory. And we commit us for service into your hands in Jesus Christ name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Maybe. Amen. As we have read these three scriptures and maybe I I just want to start with something brother Brandham is saying as a prophet would speak speaking of Abraham. And we understand we want to see Jesus Christ. Amen. We want to see Jesus Christ. yesterday because if we understand Jesus Christ yesterday then we might understand Jesus Christ of today and this scripture of Hebrew Ruth 13:8 I would say is one of the key scriptures that the prophet used one of the key scriptures. Amen. Amen. That he used to the entire his entire ministry. Actually, brother Brandham spoke about Hebrews 13:8 more than 1,700 times. Amen. Amen. So he he that's that's scripture and I want you to to uh to to want you to recognize there's re revelation 13:8 Revelation 13:8 speaks of another man manifestation and it said like this and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. So that's revelation 13:8. So revelation 13:8 is speaking of people that will worship Satan. Amen. That will just make him that will manifest him. In Hebrews 13:8 speaks of people that make Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and you understand that Revelation 13:8 speaks of people that will worship the beast and while worshiping the beast they manifest the beast. So they helped the beast to be the same today. [Music] The same works that he did years ago. Remember what is happening today is not new. It was Rome in the beginning. It was the beast in the beginning. It was the beast in the garden of Eden. It was the beast in the middle of the Bible. And it is the beast at the end of the Bible. Amen. Can you see that? It was the image of the beast in the beginning of the Bible in the middle of the Bible and in the end of the Bible. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But when you see the the beast or the image of the beast, you also see Christ and the image of Christ. You see Christ in the beginning of the Bible. You see Christ in the middle of the Bible and you see Christ in the end of the Bible. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can we see how that runs parallel and what we see what we see today? The whole world is worshiping. Is it right? Yes sir. The Bible would say, "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him." Who is him? Satan the beast. All shall worship him. Did you ever thought how that worship will manifest? You know when Jesus was was with the woman at the well he was making a very striking point and he's saying he said the father looks for worshiper that worship him in spirit and in truth. Is that right? So under worship we worship today. You worship someone not so much how you worship but it is important who you worship. Amen. Is that right? And worship means much more than singing. Worship means much more than kneeling down. [Music] Worship is worship is a lifestyle. Worship is a lifestyle. Your lifestyle is a worship to the beast or a worship to God. And Jesus was telling the woman at the well, the way you live now, you are worshiping Satan. Amen. He said to the woman at the well, "The father is seeking worship, then worship him in spirit and truth." With other words, the father is looking for dwelling places that he can live in. You understand that Satan on the same way? Do you know that a demon is powerless unless he has a body that he can use? Is that right? Remember remember when when when Jesus came to those demons and they said, "Okay, if you cast us out, if you cast us out, allow us to go into strength. Because without a body, they were powerless. And even the And even the swines, they they was running in the water because they they didn't want to be the dwelling place of demons. even demons, even the swines, they would run into the water because they didn't want to be dwelling places of demons. What about us, we should run into the water to be baptized in Jesus Christ's name because we don't want to be dwelling place of Satan. You understand that? You understand that? We should have a little bit more brain than pigs. [Music] Remember when pigs they saw that demons wanted to come. They say no. We rather take our lives than to be possessed by demons. I tell I tell you a true story. It happened in our farm many years ago. I was still a young boy and my parents had hosted meetings in our farm and it was powerful meetings where the Holy Spirit really was falling on people. That means evil spirits were leaving people. And after a powerful and a really amazing meeting one evening, my father was not a ministry, he was a farmer. My father had pigs and cows and and everything. So after really a meeting where where uh devils uh was cast out by the word, you know, preaching the word is casting out devils. As the word is being preached this morning, it can cast out devils. And as the word was preached and demons were cast out, my father, he was a farmer. And after the service, he went into to feed the pigs. He wanted to go where the pigs are and to give them food. And he said he came into the pig hole and the pigs were standing at the wall. He said, "What is going on here? The pigs were standing at the wall because they didn't want those demons. My father was shocked. But then he they I believe he remembered the scripture. He said when those demons was cast out and they wanted to go into the swine, but even the swine had enough brain not to be a dwelling place of demons. And we should have enough brain this morning not to stay a dwelling place of Satan, but to become a dwelling place of Almighty God. A dwelling place where Almighty God can live. We should have enough brain this morning not to worship the beast, but we should have enough brain this morning to worship the one and only living God and his name is Jesus Christ. To worship him and him alone. How do you worship Jesus Christ today? By giving yourself to you so that he can use you. That is a worship that God's desire. God don't need your money. He has enough. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's good to give money for the kingdom that everything works, but God don't need your money. Amen. Amen. Amen. What God needs, he needs you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Without you, God cannot be completed. If you can believe that you're a part of God. Amen. Then God needs you here. God needs you here to be completed. That's why Jesus was telling the woman at the well, the father seekers worshiper. The father is looking for worship. What about the world today? Can he find worshipper? Can he find worshipper? When you ask people, "What are you? I'm a Methodist. I'm a Baptist. That means you're telling God, I am occupied already. Amen. Amen. Amen. Look the woman at the well. What Jesus had to do, he had to set her free from everything and then he could be manifested in us. And this is what God is looking for this morning while the whole world is worshiping Satan. We should we should worship the only living God. And how do you worship him? Maybe you cannot sing. Maybe you cannot sing. Maybe you cannot dance but you can worship him and giving your life to him. It's so simple. So simple. Every day the everyday life it becomes so simple as we see it with Abraham. But really we want to go to see Jesus Christ the same and uh and we understand as brother Brandham would take that scripture Hebrews 13:8 if you read it I don't know when you read it this sentence cannot stand alone. You understand that this sentence does not stand alone. This sentence is a result. I want you to be very careful. Many times we quote that so easy Jesus Christ the same yesterday today but we don't know what is surrounding it what makes Jesus Christ the same you understand this is just a sentence that shows this is the result as I'm doing a sentence Amen. Amen. And when I say this glass of water was good, then you know a few things. Then you know a few things. You know I was thirsty. Okay. Let's let's let's make it very simple. If we had a glass of water here and don't bring it. No, James says fine, fine. I don't need but you understand if I say this glass of water was good. [Music] That sentence doesn't stand alone. You're with me? Okay. Oh, yeah. Here. Let's bring the bottle. Okay. Okay. Now, now I say this is good. He can say it was good. So you understand just to make it plain Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. It's not a sentence that stands alone. If I tell you this bottle of water was very good, that means I was thirsty. That means I have tasted it. That means I have drunken it. Then I can say this water was good. So if you see Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever that sentence is not alone. Amen. Hallelujah. Many times it becomes just like a a a slogan. We say a slogan. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. For example, when we see a healing, when we see healing, we say Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. I want you to be very careful. There's people today on earth and I trust you are some of them that makes Jesus Christ the same today. Amen. [Applause] Don't let it become just our religious slogan. [Music] Let it become your life to say this water was good. There was a need for me to drink it. Otherwise, I cannot say it's good. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So for Jesus Christ to be the same today, you need to do something. That sentence, that sentence is not standing on his own. That sentence is brought there because you are here. You make him the same today. Your presence, your availability makes Jesus Christ. the same today. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ the same. It's not a repetition. Yes, sir. Jesus Christ the same today. It's not a repetition. That's why when we look back to Jesus Christ yesterday, you know about Enoch, something very strange about Enoch. Why is there so few things written about him? Enoch was the seventh from Adam. We are the seventh from the second Adam. I want to repeat, Enoch was the seventh from the first Adam. We are the sevenths from the second Adam. Is that right? Can we say praise the Lord? Identify yourself in the scripture. Jesus could identify himself. That was his security. That was his power. That was his strength that he could say, "It is written about me." When Satan would throw the word at him, what do you do when Satan throws the truth at you? Uhhuh. Satan said to Jesus, "It is written." And it was the truth. So Satan was throwing the truth at Jesus. What are you doing when Satan is throwing the truth at you? Look in the denomination. How many people take the Bible and throw the truth? You must be baptized in the name of father, son, and holy ghost. [Music] Amen. Is that the truth? Amen. Is that what Jesus said? Is that what he said? He said, "Go in all the world, baptize them in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Ghost." Is that the truth? Yes. What do you do? And Satan throws the truth at you. Hallelujah. You understand how important that is that we have a relationship with God so that he can unveil himself and the prophet came to restore a relationship between God and man. What did Jesus do after Satan throw the truths at him? He said it is written. He said, "Yes, it's written, but it is also written." He gave him the message of the hour. Hallelujah. You can follow. It's right. It's right. But now the truth came that the name of the father, the name of the son, the name of the holy ghost is Lord Jesus Christ. That's why when Peter came. That's why when Peter came exactly what Jesus said but more defined, more plain, more revealed. Amen. Can we say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we speaking of Jesus Christ the same [Music] today. Amen. Hallelujah. You we have to understand Jesus. If you see Jesus Christ yesterday in the life of Abraham, we have to understand as a royal seed of Abraham that we are not copying Abraham. As I as I spoke about Enoch, if you read, what do you know about Enoch? We don't read much about him. We just read about him that he pleased God. He pleased God. Pleased God means adoption. So he walked into his adoption, you can please God, if you walk into your adoption, that's why God said this is my beloved son. Not only born not only born but this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased please pleased to dwell. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. What about quickly? We only strike it quickly because we want to really to go to Jesus Christ the same today. But we want to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday. so that we can under understand principles. Amen. Remember we can if you understand the principles of the Bible the principles that is there it will help you to identify God in your own life. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So as we speak of Abraham, as we speak about Enoch, and to me when I was a young Christian, I always felt Lord, if I just knew a little bit more about Enoch, it would be nice for me. I know he pleased God so that I could do what he did. And I know I please you, right? That's many times how we look at one another. We look at brother Steven and then you see his godly life and then then you then you want to copy it. You want to some people want to become like brother Steven. Some people want to become like brother Samson because he sees such a godly life in him. But you understand you are not brother Steven. You are not brother Samson. I'm not brother Steven. I'm not brother Samson. I have to be what I am. You have to be what you are. Hallelujah. You understand that? So what we have to see? We have to see the principles. We have to see the nature. That is not changing. God is an unchanging God. He cannot change his nature. But he changed his appearing many times. You understand that? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. So I believe that's why there's so little written about Enoch. What do you know about him? We know he he he just made the pyramids supposed to be. Is it right? He should be the one that was responsible for the great pyramid. You have heard about the great pyramid. The great pyramid. It's there. I think it's around if it's in Egypt somewhere. But it's there without a capping. [Music] Amen. Why? Because Enoch understood that capstone. The capstone would be come down in this hour that we are living in. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see Enoch, I want to be very very careful with you. We don't know much about Enoch. You know why that is very good that we don't copy him? You understand? Many people see Jesus Christ the same. They try to copy one another. Oh yeah. Mhm. Mhm. But Jesus Christ the same doesn't mean you copy anyone. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand? You read your Bible and you read all the examples where you can see Jesus Christ yesterday and you don't try to copy them today. You know why not? It will not work. Come on church. Remember in the time of brother Brham, he had a group of people around him that was reading the book of Acts where the believers had all in common. [Music] He said the first church, the first believers, they had all in common. one big group of people. Very important to understand that you understand that was book of acts. [Music] Is it correct? They was even having breaking of the bread daily. Is that correct? And they had all in common. They sh they shared the money. And in the time of brother Brham, there was a group of people. They tried to copy that. And somewhere in United States, they wanted to make a nice place as they had it in the book of Acts. You know why? They wanted to do it the same way. And they felt And they felt if we if we if we do it like they God will bless us like God bless you. Can I say something? A trap of the devil. A trap of the devil. That's right. Uh-huh. Mhm. Remember, it was Satan telling to Jesus, "If you do this, if you speak and do this, this will happen." You know what Jesus said? That is true. That was the word for that day. But don't try to copy me because I am the word for this day. Hallelujah. Can we understand the principle? It's so important. Paul said, "You follow me. as I follow Christ. Amen. Paul had a great encounter when he was when he was on the road to Damascus. Is that right? He had a great encounter. Amen. A light strike came down. You understand? You with me? Amen. And he was well taught in the Bible. [Music] I think he was taught under one of the greatest teachers at that time. So he knew the light that is the Lord. That's why he said Lord who are you? [Music] You know what the the the light said back? said I am Jesus. Listen. Whom thou persecutest. Who was Paul persecuting? Jesus was not alive anymore. Jesus was not alive anymore. Is that right? Come on, church. Jesus went to glory. Amen. So whom he was persecuted and the voice said now Paul was confused he know the voice is God that's why he said Lord who are you said I am Jesus and in Paul's mind he saw the picture of Jesus that you are persecuting. Amen. No, I'm not persecuting him. He's not alive at all. No. God would say, "You're persecuting him. in bride form. Now you understand come on church and you think of Jesus Christ the same. He's not a copy. He's not a past tense God. He's a present help in time of trouble. You catch that. You understand Paul? how confused he was because he didn't see the principle of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever. Paul stuck stuck in Jesus Christ yesterday. But God told him, "No, no, no, no. It's not Jesus Christ yesterday." The the the bride is Jesus Christ today. You understand that? Can we say praise the Lord? So God is waiting for you. God is not waiting for William Brandham to come back. God is not waiting for Jesus Christ. God is waiting for you because you make him. You have the potential to make Jesus Christ the same today. Can you say praise the Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe what God said about the first church? Amen. Now Paul had to believe in order to believe. He had to believe what the Lord said what God said who Jesus Christ is. I ask you a question. Do you believe what God in this hour said who Jesus Christ is? Do we believe it took Paul a long time to see his great error? He searched the scriptures and he saw the tides and shadows and then he understood the three years in the Arabian desert and showed him how wrong he was because he didn't see Jesus Christ. He even was persecuting Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Now I think we are warm. The angel now is warm. Now let's move. [Music] We have the saying in cold Germany. And this world is spiritually very cold. That's why you should come early to church. Is that right? Why do we come early to church? Why do we pray? Why do we sing songs to warm up? Yes. Come once to Germany. Brother Steven was there. But we are in our winter time. He is not leaving the room and the car because it's too cold outside. And you know what we do in winter time? We start our engines of the car and we let it run for a couple of minutes [Music] till the engine becomes warm and then we can go. And I believe this morning The engine is warm now. Okay, then let's go. Okay, then let's move now. Let's move now. Is it okay? Let's put the first gear in. That's why we started the car at all. We don't start the car to go backwards. We start the car to go forward. Now, now let's let's move together forward. Are you ready for it? Do you believe him? Because it will be so simple. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's move. Brother is shouting to the people. He said, "Don't be like Israel." Or he said, "Be like Israel." When Israel was moving in the wilderness and even when they when they settled down, the Holy Spirit was settling down, they quickly put up their tents. A tabernacle in the wilderness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you a tabernacle in this wilderness? Are we in the wilderness? Are we in the wilderness? Yes, we are in the wilderness. We are not in Egypt anymore. We are not what we were in Satan's Eden in Laia. We are like in the wilderness. Here we are pilgrims and strangers. Come on church. And you know what Israel should do? When the Holy Spirit settling down the church, can you understand how the Holy Spirit many times is settling down? Be established. Be established in this truth. Be established. Be established in the water baptism. Settling down. Come. Be established in the Godhead. Be established in water baptism. Is that not right? It looks like the Holy Spirit just coming and stops that way. Let's put our tents down here for a moment and let's settle down. You need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Settle them down. When that is settled, the Holy Spirit's moving up again because we are going forward, not backwards. And watch watch what brother Ranom says when the Holy Spirit settled down. Remember they had to put their own tents and also the tabernacle of the wilderness. Uhhuh. It was it was it was not Solomon's temple. That was not easy to to build it up and move. That's why they had in the in the desert they had a portable they had a portable tabernacle. You understand that? Come on church. It was in the same fashion as later the temple of Solomon. But it was made for the purpose. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you are made for this purpose. To live in Satan's Eden to live in Satan's Eden. To be in Laia and yet to move to the promised land. The promised land in this case is the millennium. Is that okay? Do we understand that? Now watch Adam said they should not put their sticks too deep down. How many times we have put the sticks so deep down that you have become a denomination. [Music] That's that's a denomination. They take the truth, reveal truth and put it deep down and they said we believe it. We never move from here and it becomes a denomination. You know when it becomes a denomination? When God is moving, when God is showing more truth, You know why they are denomination bound themselves down? So even in the message don't bind yourself down even with this message. Don't bind yourself down to God send a prophet. Don't bind yourself down to God sent a prophet. You die as a denomination because when God sends a prophet, there's a reason for him to send a prophet. And this is where the Holy Spirit wants to take us to now. We believe God sent the prophets. Now we want to move to the purpose for why God sent one. Why? Why did Abraham send Eleazar? You're all Bible readers. Why did Abraham the father Uhhuh. not Isaac the son. It was Abraham the father. Is it not amazing? Is it not amazing? Is what? It was not Isaac telling to Eleazar. You know what? I think I need a wife. No, no, no. It was not Jesus Christ. [Music] The Bible said, "Behold, I God himself 4, behold, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet." Who is that? God himself. Hallelujah. Is that right? Come on, church. Take go to Bible principles. It was the father looking for a wife for his son. It was the father. It was God. It was God himself sending Malachi 4. [Music] Hallelujah. And when Eleazar was sent out, what did Abraham told him? There was a purpose for him to go. [Music] That purpose of Eleazar was not to find followers of him. The purpose of Eleazar was not to to have followers. [Music] Do you know John the Baptist got followers called the disciples of John? But John was not sent to make disciples after him. Elaza was not sent to make little Ilazas after him. Brother Brandham was not sent that we would follow him. Yes, we follow him but we follow him to find Christ. The main purpose of Eleazar was to bring the bride to Isaac. Come on, church. You understand that? Rebecca's purpose. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's always the father. I have to I have to jump back. If you if you take the uh that principle there in Matthew 22 where a king is making wedding for his son. It's not it's I think it's Matthew 22, right? A king is making wedding for his son. Don't have to read it. It was not the son making wedding for himself. It was the father making the wedding. Is that right? It was the father sending messengers out to get people in. Is that right? Amen. Amen. You see the principal church, it's the father. Jesus told the woman at the well, it is the father they're seeking for worship. Amen. You with me? So God is behind Malachi 4. God is behind sending a prophet. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when God sends a prophet, that prophet is not there alone. There is a purpose and a reason why God sends a prophet. And the purpose and the reason is a bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the message, hallelujah, the message came, all the truth came to wake up the bride. The truth of the message, the opening of the seals, the renting of the book was for the church to understand their position. [Music] Remember that wonderful book that was closed in Revelations 5 and John wept. That book was open and it is called a little book in Revelations 10. He said, "And I saw a little book open. Fear not little flock." Hallelujah. You understand? And I saw a little book open speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ. And the same book. Come on church. The same book that was John was not worthy to look at. But when a bloody lamb had taken it. But when a bloody lamb had taken it because it was a bloody lamb that took the book out of the hands of the original owner paid the price. Can we say amen to that? Paid the price. So now the same book that John was not worthy to look at, he is commanded to eat the book. Now, where is the book now? Where is the book now? Where is the book now, church? Where is the book now? Can I ask you a question? Where is the book today? Have we eaten the book? Who has eaten the book? Hallelujah. Eating means to unite. Hallelujah. Remember in the garden of Eden they was eating from the tree. [Music] What was that? A wrong union. And because of eating came the fall. Can we say praise the Lord because of eating in the garden came before we know today it was an affair. [Music] Eating the book is an affair. It's a uniting. You become one with what God said about you. You believe what he speaks about you. So then who where's the book now? Where's the book now? Come on. Don't be shy. Where is the book now? Here. You can say here it's me. Hallelujah. Can you say that together? Where is the book now? Come on church. Hallelujah. Amen. As I said, okay, this was now first gear. Now let's go in the second one. Amen. [Music] Because the engine is warm. So let's drive. Let's move now. Is that okay? Amen. Everybody's comfortable. As we are going, you better fasten your seat belts. You don't need a seat. You don't need a seat belt when you are standing but you need a seat belt. You know when you're sitting in the plane as we are flying and the higher you fly sometimes some turbulences come and I tell you where we are on our way sometimes it becomes turbulence. This is so contrary. Satan is trying to shake the car, trying you to slow down. Okay, we are ready. [Music] My allow me to give you out of the church age book to get very close to Hebrews 13:8 and as I said that sentence when I say this water was good between the meetings I will drink it between the meetings I will empty the water when I come back to the second service. I will let you know that water was missed and then you know something has happened something has changed. So when it said he is the same yesterday, today and forever, it's a consequence of what is happening. You make Jesus Christ the same today. [Music] The simple life that you live, the simple life that you live, don't try to be William Brandham. Don't try to be like the pastor. Don't try to be like brother Samson. Don't try to be like the one from Germany. When I say in my own church, I say don't try to be like me. One of me is more than enough. Is that okay? Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. As brother Brennan, brother Brennham came to the church eight messengers. Now remember, we have the church ages, right? We have the church ages. We have the church ages from Ephesus, Sina, Pergamon, Tatara, Zadis, Philadelphia, Philadelphia. And we are living in the last church age. It was also cities in minor Asia. Is that right? It was all cities in minor Asia. typing the church age that would come what characteristic it would be and remember what is loudia speaking of loudia speaks of people's rights are we not living in a time are we not living in a time when everyone is claiming his rights Is it not right? All the homosexuals claim their rights. All the total queer people claim their rights. They claim their right to be wrong. [Music] They claim a right to be foolish. It's bad enough that they are foolish. It's bad enough that they are stupid, but now they claim the right to be stupid. [Music] Is Is that not the time we're living in? Watch church very carefully. Everyone speaking of his rights. Nobody is interested in duties. Nobody interested in duties. You know we are suffering of a society where everyone is only thinking on his rights. Nobody is carrying any more of his duties. That is a characteristic of Laudisia. Yes sir. Oh my my my my my. Hallelujah. Not so the bride of Jesus Christ. We should understand our rights. We should understand our God-given rights. Is that right? But we should never forget as a prophet would say at the final stage you're not on the wings of a snow white dove. What is he saying? What is he saying? He said is a dove leading the eagle now. Amen. Come on, church. It's a dove leading the eagle. [Music] You understand what a dove stands for? Yes, sir. Amen. A dove and a lamb, they go together. They have the same nature. They have the same nature. And we understand what a lamb is doing. A lamb is giving away his rights. Amen. That's right. Oh my. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Is it okay? We go now in the third gear. Okay. We will get faster. And I trust you have your seat belts on. Maybe get turbulence. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. It's a age that we are living in. My goodness. Allow me to read to you something. I have taken that from this is um this is a a drawing some a professor of a university a university for politics. How to run a country? Not a believer. Not a believer. Just a normal professor would make would make a pamphlet for his students as a foundation. You understand that? Yes sir. I trust I can read it. It's very interesting speaking of the day that we are living in and hold fast be we are going quickly because we want to see how it fits perfectly with what God is doing in this day. Listen very carefully. So this is a professor for for political students, [Music] principles how to run a country and what happened in our day. Listen, it's not a believer, but to me it was striking. You ready? The affirmation of rights. And the denial of duties is one of the fundamental contradictions in human life. Of course, it is more comfortable the way of life to take more than to give. You know how Jesus said it's better to give Okay. It is easier, more comfortable to take more than to give. Assert rights comprehensively against others and to deny duty [Music] towards others. [Music] Listen what that man is saying. The aim of this module, the aim of this outcome is to make clear that in every society, every right necessarily needs a duty. and rights can only be successfully exercised if duties are recognized at the same time. Listen what that man is saying in the past two decades. The sense of duty has sometimes been mostly classified as mere a secondary virtue. [Music] However, if duties are no longer taken seriously, rights will sooner or later come to nothing. My goodness. [Music] Can I say something church? Our rights that we have become powerless if we neglect our simple duty. That's why you can see in the life of Abraham it said after these things the Lord came back to him after these things after what things after Abraham had done his normal duties. [Music] Can we say praise the Lord? Look how that man is saying that. However, if duties are no longer taken seriously, rights will sooner or later come to an effect. This would ultimately result in a loss of personal freedom and social justice in society. [Music] Yes, that is correct. Is it not? So that is true. You see when the in the world everyone is thinking on his rights now is it okay? Now we go to gear four. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And at the end of the day, we end of gear five. You will see it's all grace from the beginning. Now let's very quickly we have to as we speak of duties we have to understand that the covenant that the covenant that the covenant of Abraham is unconditionally. Amen. To understand duties in the right way, we have to understand that the covenant is unconditionally. And allow me to add to my title. It's Jesus Christ the same today by unconditional duties. Amen. Now we start. Hallelujah. Isn't it amazing? We see it in the life of Abraham how Jesus Christ was there yesterday. the same how he lived in Abraham. Come on. Jesus Christ was not even born. Is it correct? But who was that in Genesis 19 spoke to God himself? Who was that that said, God, if there's 50 righteous would you destroy Sodom? And God said, if I find 50, I don't destroy. Then Abraham said, Lord, if there's only 40, God said, if there's 40, who was that? Who was that trying to negotiate with God? Who can talk to God like that? Who can talk to God like that? Only Jesus Christ. Amen. So we understand that was Jesus Christ through Abraham. Amen. Is it today? Jesus Christ through the church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How simple. What did Abraham do? Because the covenant was unconditional. Is it right? The covenant was unconditional. Can we say that together? Unconditionally. So your duties are not a condition. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. your duties. You don't It's not if you do that you go to heaven. No, you do that because you understood your position. You do that because you know who you are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, it's my duty to love him. Amen. Amen. Can I make it clearer? It's my duty to love him. You know why? Because I know who I am. I know I'm the part of the bride of Jesus Christ. And as a bride of Jesus Christ, you have to love him. So it is my duty to love him. And because I love him, I know that he loves me because I cannot love him without he first loving me. Do you love him who loves him this morning? Then you are sure that he loves you because you cannot love him without him loving you. He loved you first and purchased your salvation. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. You understand that? But as a wife it is it is my duty to love him. Is it okay when we speak of duties? Amen. But today nobody wants duties. Because too too many too many times the devil tells us duties are conditions. Too many times the devil tried to tell us duties are conditions. So he tells you if you have to wear a long dress otherwise you go to hell. [Music] No, the long dress is not a condition. You understand that? Come on church. The devil is many times trying to tell you that a duty is a condition. But not so for Abraham. Come on, church. Not so for Abraham. Abraham had a covenant without condition. Can we say praise the Lord to that? Allow me for a few minutes. Maybe we have to skip it to the afternoon though. But it will be beautiful. I tell you, it's beautiful. How Jesus Christ was the same yesterday. Simple. Do you want to let Jesus Christ be the same today? What must I do, Lord? What miracle must I do? What magic must I do so that Jesus Christ is the same? Is it not the question? many times who wants to see Jesus Christ the same day. I pray that God opens our eyes that we might see. Come on, church. You don't have to do magic. You don't have to do a miracle. You don't have to heal the sick. Hallelujah. Oh, may the showers of blessing fall like the rain fall. Hallelujah. May we become wet. May the may the water of the Holy Ghost, the water of life overfloods. [Music] [Applause] Give me give me 10 minutes and then shift it to the afternoon. The Lord's willing because it's so beautiful. You will see what did Abraham do. Come on. What did Abraham do to let him Jesus Christ be the same? Tell me what did he do? How many dead people Abraham raised? Come again. How many dead people? How many dead people he raised? [Music] Zero. Zero. So that means Jesus Christ can be the same in your life even if you never raise a dead. [Applause] Can we say praise the Lord? How many sick people Abraham healed? had mistakes. Come on, church. Did Abraham had mistakes? Did Abraham lied? And God told him, "Be perfect and walk before me. Amen. Come on church judge. Are we the royal seed of Abraham? If we are in Christ, if we are Christ, we are the royal seed of Abraham. So if you are in Christ, you are the royal seed of Abraham. And if you're the roy of Abraham, brother Brandon would say, you walked the same way Abraham walked. Amen. The same steps he did, you did. You But you are not called from Cala. [Music] You are you are not called out out of Calalda because you are not living in cala. [Music] You understand that? Come on church. But you are called out like Abraham was called out. Is it not so? God called you out from wherever he found you. He called you out denomination. He called you out of the world. He called you out of sin. And like he called Abraham, he called you. Abraham, come out and go into the country that I show thee. What was it? Not if you do. I have done it already. an unconditional covenant. Give me allow me quickly to a little bit more. Go to what is a covenant by the way? You know God making a covenant with Abraham. It was not Abraham making one with God. Many times we try to make covenants with God. Right? So Lord I promise you if you do this I do that. We try to make a We try to make a covenant with God. Is that right? We want to pull God on our level. This is exactly what a covenant is. What is a marriage covenant? The husband is calling a wife to his level. Hallelujah. Is that correct? Come on, church. She even has a new name. Amen. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Come on, church. That's a covenant. A covenant is, allow me quickly to make that plain. A covenant is a describing a relationship that is based on mutal commitments. [Music] And that covenant was without condition. Give me a few minutes. I trust you can be here this afternoon. Maybe we will finish it up. We are already in gear four. Right. Amen. Amen. Amen. Abraham came somewhere in the middle of the Bible, not in the beginning. Brother Brandon would say God made three covenants. One covenant with Adam, one covenant with Noah and then a covenant with Abraham. Matthew 1, something for you to know, something to ponder about. Matthew 1. The generation of Jesus Christ starts with whom? Abraham, go to Matthew 1. Take Matthew 1. Go to Matthew 1. [Music] How is the generation of Jesus Christ beginning? Let's go to Matthew 1, New Testament. This is how our New Testament starts, right? [Music] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Now go to the second verse. I blame is not amazing. It starts with Abraham, not with Adam. Did you ever ponder why it was Abraham? And if we are in Christ, we are the royal seed of [Applause] [Music] not Adam. Is Paul confused? Is Paul confused when he said to the Galatians? If we are in Christ, we are the royal seed of Abraham, not the royal seed of Adam, not the royal seed of Noah, the royal seed of Abraham. [Music] Yes, sir. It starts with Abraham. Can I blame something wrong? Somebody don't know history or don't know. [Music] Hey, it's Paul a little confused. Has he he he read the the Torah, the books of the Old Testament? And he knows exactly the genealogy. He know exactly that the seventh from Adam was Enoch. [Music] Not even with Enoch. It starts [Music] it starts with a man that was an idol worshipper. The generation of Jesus Christ starts with an idol worship. [Applause] So it shows you wherever you are at God can chose you. There's no sin too big. There's nothing too hard for God. Whatever your past was, he can make it a brilliant future. He took an idol worshipper started with him the generation of Jesus Christ. Why Abraham? H okay we have to close time is running. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then because maybe we have to finish this because we have to understand what God is doing when God made the first covenant with man. It was with Adam. Is that right? And what was the first covenant? It was a re it was describing a relationship. Yes. He said Adam you are me in another form. Okay. You are God of the earth. I'm God of heaven. So a covenant is also an agreement. A covenant is also a multiplication mandate because it was told to Adam, multiply and replenish the earth. That's a covenant. Is that correct? Brother Brandham said, "What did God do? Christ the mystery of God revealed." said God put men in partnership with him. Is that right? That's a covenant, church. God is making a covenant. God telling to Adam. You are my partner. He said, "Okay." Amen. Amen. Come on, church. Is it not amazing? When the all earth was flooded, Noah moved up. Finally, nobody on earth anymore. Is that right? All human beings are gone. Everything is gone. Is that correct? Noah stepped out of the ark. You know what God told him? Multiply and replenish the earth. Come on, church. What did he tell to Abraham? Nothing else. Abraham, he called him out. He said, "Your seed will be like the stars. with other words multiply and replenish the earth. Hallelujah. You're with me. Now with that we are leaving because we we want to this is this is uh we speak of Abraham and the covenant. It's a covenant without conditions. But the covenant, you can understand is only effective if Abraham walks in his duties. The covenant you have that God gave you is unconditionally. Amen. Amen. Can we say praise the Lord? And it becomes effective. Genesis 15 said after these things. [Music] Genesis 7. Genesis 7 said after these things. Even Genesis 22 it said after these things. After things that Abraham did, God appeared to him. after he separated from Lot, God came back to him and renewed the the covenant. Is that right? Amen. Amen. With that, I'm closing because we have to close just to understand what covenant we have. What covenant we have? Are you in the generation of Jesus Christ? There's 14 generations. [Music] You can bring the scripture up. Maybe it's 14 generations from Abraham. Can give it to him. Goes a little further. I don't have it for me, but said there's 14 generations from Abraham. We should quickly find it. I think it's very important. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And you go ahead at home and you count it. You read your Bible. 14 generations. Give that if you find that. Sorry to don't let you know that before, but if you can find it quickly, you have it. Okay. So, listen. 17. So, all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations. [Music] And from David until the carrying away into Babylon are 14 generations. [Music] And from the carrying away into Babylon are 14. And from the carrying away into Babations. If you count it carefully, you will find here to Christ only 13 generations. You do your homework, you count it. 144 and from Babylon to Christ, you will find in your own Bible only 13 generations. Hallelujah. You know why? You are the last generation. We are the final generation that makes Jesus Christ complete. Amen. Hallelujah. You know why? Because we have a covenant with God. Hallelujah. God bless you, saints. We have to stop here. Yeah. Let's give him a hand of praise. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you not glad for a covenant? [Music] church that covenant is unconditional. Can we say together unconditional? God made it with you before you were born. Hallelujah. He put your name in the lamb's book of life before you came to earth. You understand to make it very clear. Amen. Even if you make a mistake, you can never lose that. [Music] You can never lose the covenant. [Music] Can we say praise the Lord? [Applause] Let us stand together. Let us pray. Amen. We sorry we had to cut it here. It will be just too much to uh go on in once. This this afternoon we want to speak about the duties of Abraham that made the covenant effective. It's not a condition. Not if you do I do. know I said I have already done it all that you do now is to keep the things effective. Can we say thank you Lord? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just imagine think about The great God of heaven, creator of all things. He made the sun. He made the moon. He made the stars. He created the universe. He made the angels. That great unexhaustible fountain of life who filled all time and space [Music] comes to you. I said, "Do you want to be my partner? my partner. Amen. Do you want to be my partner? Amen. Amen. Do you want to be his partner today? Let us pray. Heavenly Father, Father, somehow Baba, we cannot bring it in one picture. Father, but may it be oh God that the right kind of atmosphere is created. What has been said? What's been done? May it have created the right kind of atmosphere for your spirit now to do what I cannot do. Oh God, with each and everyone here, they have shown unto you, Father, that they want to be your partner. They are yours. [Music] Deal with each and everyone according to their level.

They are yours, father. They doesn't belong. These people here, [Music] your bride doesn't belong to any man. They don't belong to just a church. They belong to you.
