[36:05] behold a woman in the
[36:09] city the Bible says she was a
[36:15] sinner praise the Lord this woman was
[36:20] [Music]
[36:21] a praise the Lord and the Bible says
[36:25] when she knew that Jesus was Jesus sat
[36:29] at
[36:31] me in the phes
[36:34] house an albaster
[36:44] oil praise the
[36:46] Lord and
[36:48] then and sat at his
[36:52] feet
[36:54] him weeping
[36:57] and began to wash his feet with
[37:02] tears wipe them with the Airs of her
[37:09] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[37:14] them with the
[37:19] ointment now when the Pharisee which had
[37:24] bidden him saw it
[37:32] when he saw the woman anointing the feet
[37:35] of
[37:39] Jesus he saw it and the Bible says spoke
[37:44] within
[37:47] himself saying this
[37:50] man he were a
[37:55] prophet I love the
[38:00] things he gives you why
[38:04] he before he gives you the reason why he
[38:09] is
[38:11] present he first acts
[38:17] F now look at this
[38:19] scenario it was
[38:24] like Jesus didn't know the sins of this
[38:27] woman
[38:31] because the
[38:35] phus that if he was a Son of
[38:39] God if he was a
[38:41] prophet like they had spoken of
[38:44] him he would have known the woman he is
[38:50] with the nature of this
[38:53] woman so the
[38:56] thought Jes
[38:58] Jesus never knew the situation of this
[39:02] woman praise the Lord but then what
[39:05] happened he started saying it within his
[39:10] heart if he were a
[39:14] prophet would if he was a prophet have
[39:18] known who and what manner of woman this
[39:22] is that toucheth her I mean him for she
[39:26] is a sinner
[39:35] and the Bible says she was a
[39:38] sinner and
[39:40] then like you know people Miss in the
[39:43] misunderstand
[39:46] Christ they don't interpret him
[39:50] well praise the Lord because for him on
[39:54] Earth he came for the sinners
[40:01] he came for
[40:02] Sinn he came for
[40:05] the he came for people who were in his
[40:10] mind that's
[40:13] why Propet says God cannot lose
[40:19] anybody who was given in his
[40:23] hand Christ will never lose any person
[40:27] was given in his
[40:29] hand that was in his right
[40:34] hand he can't lose any of them no matter
[40:38] the condition they
[40:41] in Praise the Lord to
[40:45] this if he was a
[40:48] Believer he would
[40:50] know woman
[40:55] wasie praise the Lord
[40:58] so let's go on the Bible
[41:01] says and Jesus answering said unto
[41:06] him I have some to say unto
[41:11] them and he
[41:17] say and then he
[41:20] started there was a certain
[41:24] creditor had two dat
[41:30] no is it that read it I want to see it
[41:33] in the Bible
[41:43] in Praise the Lord there was a man who
[41:46] was
[41:48] rich he had people he was
[41:52] demanding and he said he owed 500 pen
[42:03] another and then
[42:06] when they had nothing to
[42:12] pay frankly forgave them
[42:17] both he's asking Simon now tell me
[42:22] therefore which of
[42:24] them which of them will love him
[42:29] most and then he
[42:31] started Simon answer and said I suppose
[42:35] that he to whom he gave he gave most he
[42:40] forgave most and he said unto them unto
[42:43] him thou rightly
[42:52] judged he turned to the woman
[42:57] this is what I want praise the Lord he
[43:01] turned to the
[43:04] woman said
[43:07] Simon words he was telling
[43:11] Simon that the one you s is not my
[43:16] own praise the Lord it was Christ
[43:20] presenting her to
[43:27] said
[43:30] Simon thou this
[43:34] woman you read it I want hear the right
[43:38] words of these these verses read
[43:48] it enter into
[43:52] house thou Gest me no
[43:55] water for my
[43:57] feet but she had washed my feet with
[44:04] tears with with the hair of her
[44:09] head and then he
[44:11] says then thou Gest me no
[44:16] kiss in other words you welcomed me not
[44:21] embed me you
[44:24] sh because of the way I look
[44:28] but this woman since the time I came
[44:33] in has not seed to kiss my
[44:45] feet my head with o thou not
[44:51] an but this woman has anointed my feet
[44:54] with oil o
[44:59] he says wherefore I say unto
[45:02] thee sins which are
[45:06] many are
[45:09] forgiven loved
[45:11] much whom little Is Forgiven the same
[45:20] little he said and he said unto her thy
[45:25] sins are forgiven
[45:27] and they that sat at meat with with him
[45:31] began to say within themselves who is
[45:34] this that forgive
[45:44] also and the one who forgives
[45:47] sin and he said unto the
[45:50] woman thy
[45:53] faith Saed the go in
[45:59] praise the Lord may the Lord add a
[46:01] blessing to the reading of the
[46:04] word now you know this
[46:08] scenario when we see
[46:13] it
[46:15] Jesus he was not
[46:17] saying neither was he supporting
[46:22] Sinners praise the Lord Jesus was not
[46:26] that he supports people who do
[46:31] evil praise the Lord like last
[46:37] Sunday the mind of
[46:40] Christ the mind of God is
[46:44] real praise the Lord anybody who is in
[46:48] the mind of God for
[46:53] salvation he real praise the Lord
[46:57] there's no reason that even though
[46:59] someone is doing evil that man can look
[47:02] and
[47:06] debate the mind of God is
[47:11] real when the comes upon her
[47:17] him and she Embraces that
[47:20] Grace and she uses the opportunity to
[47:24] welcome the grace of God
[47:27] the B says the
[47:30] faith that she has in that
[47:36] word praise the Lord not that Jesus is
[47:40] supporting
[47:42] Sinners but for him when he presents
[47:44] himself as a
[47:47] savior people to choose him for
[47:53] salvation praise the Lord Christ likes
[47:56] people
[48:03] for praise the Lord so this
[48:06] woman she got an opportunity in a
[48:09] stranger
[48:13] house yet she was not the one who
[48:17] invited the
[48:20] Savior praise the Lord she didn't invite
[48:25] Jesus after
[48:28] life was not worth Toc
[48:32] him praise the
[48:35] Lord as busy as
[48:42] Simon as bus Simon was too busy in his
[48:46] other you
[48:49] [Music]
[48:52] know after CL
[48:57] they were Vis
[48:59] status you know they were on the same
[49:03] you know like that Association reach
[49:05] Association and things like
[49:08] that praise the Lord but what happened
[49:12] the woman didn't invite
[49:15] Christ as busy as
[49:20] Simon praise the Lord you can never
[49:24] invite Christ
[49:28] and you think he has come by your
[49:33] invitation praise the Lord Christ comes
[49:37] because
[49:40] oftion praise the Lord that's why
[49:43] brother
[49:45] says Jesus didn't heal
[49:49] anyone until he was revealed to the
[49:54] father praise the Lord
[49:59] there were many
[50:04] there why that was the testimony that
[50:07] God wanted that
[50:11] place praise the Lord whenever God comes
[50:15] our
[50:17] ways not that we have written a letter
[50:19] to
[50:21] him praise the Lord you invite him
[50:27] for him he is obligated to
[50:31] come where there is
[50:34] need praise the Lord he always
[50:38] come for him it doesn't care the
[50:41] situation you are
[50:44] in as long as you invite
[50:47] him as long as he has come even without
[50:50] your
[50:55] invitation praise the Lord he only
[50:58] expects
[51:01] you to be very
[51:07] conscious prise the Lord be
[51:11] very praise the
[51:13] Lord because if he comes he never
[51:18] whispered to this
[51:21] woman be very
[51:23] careful when I'm in that house are the
[51:27] purpose why have
[51:29] [Music]
[51:30] come doesn't do like that he wants you
[51:36] to live by
[51:38] faith praise the Lord that whenever he
[51:41] is on
[51:42] ground on the
[51:45] scene your faith connects to
[51:49] him
[51:51] until things can
[51:54] change praise the Lord he doesn't want
[51:58] to come because the pastors invited
[52:03] him praise the Lord yes he may
[52:08] [Music]
[52:12] come praise the Lord other people may
[52:15] write invitations to
[52:20] Christ let me tell you the
[52:22] truth I wish Christ was in a certain
[52:26] Nation
[52:31] country that would be the most populated
[52:39] Nation the Lord I wish was
[52:48] somewhere bels stays
[52:52] here he would not
[52:54] rest because everybody like him in his
[52:58] church everybody like him in
[53:02] house praise the
[53:04] Lord praise the Lord but this is a
[53:10] scenario praise the
[53:12] Lord he has come and he wants
[53:17] them to get
[53:21] connectedto
[53:23] him his presence
[53:26] they were too
[53:28] busy they were
[53:31] moers praise the
[53:34] Lord people who didn't love
[53:39] Jesus praise the Lord maybe they wanted
[53:42] to bring him in that
[53:45] committee to show to the
[53:48] people that look at this prophet of
[53:54] people look at the king of
[53:58] here if he was to come
[54:01] here more than
[54:04] us he can sit in the corner there and
[54:09] comfort how is how is
[54:14] King the but they were too
[54:18] busy were no not they were just in there
[54:22] you know conversing in other things when
[54:24] Jesus is there
[54:28] they were not
[54:30] careful they were not
[54:33] conscious and there the s that was
[54:41] conscious it was
[54:44] saved praise the Lord the that was
[54:49] cons was taken
[54:53] away praise the Lord
[55:00] were taken
[55:02] away praise the Lord even us
[55:06] now
[55:07] Christ wants us when we are in his
[55:13] presence we should be very
[55:17] conscious be very
[55:20] sober praise the Lord would be very
[55:25] sober even that man who had taken that
[55:28] invitation to
[55:30] Christ not Simon Simon was a rich man
[55:33] maybe he had an messenger or something
[55:36] like
[55:38] that tell him Christ you invited in
[55:42] Simon
[55:45] house even that man
[55:48] alone he was
[55:52] me of
[55:55] Christ ever he was meant to bring the
[55:59] information was me to leave the presence
[56:01] of God
[56:06] forgiven praise the Lord but aftering
[56:10] the
[56:11] message what happened there's Noory of
[56:15] that man in the
[56:19] Bible praise the Lord praise the Lord
[56:23] people like Paul
[56:26] in
[56:29] prison praise the Lord when he was in
[56:34] prison and then the angel of the Lord
[56:37] came and
[56:40] opened what
[56:42] happened the man wanted to kill
[56:46] himself and he
[56:49] said all
[56:51] here praise the Lord and what happened
[56:55] [Music]
[56:57] that man was
[57:00] conscious that this is a man of
[57:04] God and when he took the
[57:09] conscious the of that
[57:13] man got
[57:15] saved praise the Lord because they were
[57:17] conscious of the presence of
[57:21] God us who read the
[57:23] Bible the Ang of the Lord came
[57:28] praise the Lord when he came that man
[57:32] was not left the
[57:36] same praise the Lord he was forgiven of
[57:40] his sins and his
[57:43] family praise the Lord but many times in
[57:49] churches people are brought right in the
[57:51] presence of the
[57:53] Lord are brought right in the presence
[57:55] of of the
[57:58] Lord and they turn
[58:02] away praise the Lord and they turn
[58:06] away but the presence of God is Among
[58:11] Us people turn
[58:14] away
[58:17] things praise the Lord but the presence
[58:20] of God it must break us down
[58:27] praise the Lord the presence of
[58:29] God has never left a man
[58:34] up unless not part of that
[58:40] presence praise the Lord all the
[58:45] prophets when
[58:49] came they were bowing down as dead
[58:57] this woman when the presence of God
[59:00] came she broke down as dead in
[59:07] tears because the Bible says she was no
[59:10] seing kissing theet of
[59:15] Christ meaning she was bowing
[59:20] down praise the Lord she was bowing down
[59:25] whenever there's a presence of
[59:28] God we must
[59:30] sober otherwise we as we came even more
[59:35] worse than
[59:38] we praise the Lord you may
[59:41] come and you're okay for the
[59:45] service you no you've come and you're
[59:49] ready for the service or you may come
[59:52] and you're ready for the presence of the
[59:55] Lord
[59:57] but then when is
[1:00:12] speaking will
[1:00:17] go but when the presence of God is
[1:00:21] come the truth is has never left
[1:00:25] children children of God the
[1:00:28] same praise the Lord has never them the
[1:00:33] same even us if we want to profess our
[1:00:39] healing if we want to Proclaim our
[1:00:46] healing the prophet
[1:00:50] says people are not ready for
[1:00:57] people are not ready for
[1:00:59] healing why they're not conscious of the
[1:01:02] presence of
[1:01:05] God praise the Lord people are not ready
[1:01:09] for
[1:01:12] salvation why they're not conscious of
[1:01:15] the word of
[1:01:17] God conscious of the presence of
[1:01:21] God praise the Lord so why are we in
[1:01:25] church
[1:01:28] we are here in his
[1:01:31] presence and when we are in his
[1:01:34] presence it must do an
[1:01:38] effect praise the Lord it must do an
[1:01:43] effect praise the Lord because the first
[1:01:46] thing when you are in the presence of
[1:01:50] God Lord forgive
[1:01:53] me praise the Lord first thing when the
[1:01:57] presence of God is before
[1:02:01] us Lord forgive
[1:02:06] me you to be like this man
[1:02:11] Simon praise the Lord and this man
[1:02:15] Simon what happened he missed it because
[1:02:20] the opportunity
[1:02:23] came he missed it the opportunity came
[1:02:28] and he was not
[1:02:31] conscious praise the Lord and what
[1:02:35] happened you know what happened most of
[1:02:40] us we don't know that the word of
[1:02:44] God when it is before us it is the
[1:02:48] presence of
[1:02:50] God praise the Lord most we may take the
[1:02:55] word of God
[1:02:57] usual
[1:03:00] statements praise the Lord let me tell
[1:03:03] you this Joseph one time okay this is
[1:03:09] the Prophet Joseph one time the prophet
[1:03:12] States how that God through that boy how
[1:03:17] that God through that
[1:03:20] boy you know
[1:03:22] Joseph he did he was not
[1:03:28] praise the Lord J was not
[1:03:32] warned that be careful
[1:03:35] Joseph when your brothers want to kill
[1:03:39] you I am the one
[1:03:49] behind Joseph when even you are sold in
[1:03:54] Egypt it is of Glory it is of my
[1:03:58] glory I wanted you to go
[1:04:02] there praise the Lord neither did
[1:04:08] come that the woman
[1:04:11] of she's Rising against you that you may
[1:04:15] go and become a prime minister the other
[1:04:19] side God never told him steps of his
[1:04:24] doing but he just
[1:04:26] presented his presence with
[1:04:31] him praise the Lord he presented the
[1:04:35] presence of God around
[1:04:38] Joseph when the woman
[1:04:41] came lie with
[1:04:44] me's word was I can't do such a
[1:04:49] thing before my
[1:04:51] Lord praise the Lord meaning
[1:04:57] maintained and he had recognized and he
[1:05:00] was
[1:05:01] conscious of the presence of
[1:05:04] God that's why even when evil
[1:05:08] came Joseph knew that God was
[1:05:12] around praise the
[1:05:14] Lord knew
[1:05:17] was
[1:05:19] here how that God through that
[1:05:24] boy over was
[1:05:27] foreshadowing the com of the Lord
[1:05:30] Jesus the first time and the first and
[1:05:34] the coming of the Lord
[1:05:36] Jesus the second time you know that in
[1:05:41] the life of
[1:05:42] Jose was foring the first and the second
[1:05:49] coming the prophet
[1:05:51] says and worked it all out in a life
[1:05:54] that know nothing about what was going
[1:06:01] on praise the Lord even this woman she
[1:06:07] didn't know why Jesus
[1:06:11] come praise the Lord she didn't know
[1:06:14] that God had come for
[1:06:17] her even Joseph didn't know why God
[1:06:20] wanted him to go all those pain
[1:06:25] praise the Lord then the prophet says
[1:06:28] don't that don't that just do something
[1:06:31] to
[1:06:32] you okay he
[1:06:34] says in another message the same says
[1:06:39] don't that just do something to
[1:06:42] you okay to see poor little
[1:06:48] Joseph to see little
[1:06:50] Joseph why he didn't know what was
[1:06:53] taking place
[1:06:57] why all these things should
[1:07:00] happen but it was all God working
[1:07:06] out praise the Lord it was all God
[1:07:10] working
[1:07:12] out praise the Lord this
[1:07:15] woman for Jesus to come in the phes
[1:07:19] home for God presence to be the house of
[1:07:23] of Simon
[1:07:26] allow me to say
[1:07:28] this God blinded Simon and his
[1:07:33] fellows R this
[1:07:37] one praise the Lord otherwise if Simon
[1:07:41] had Ed him the way he was to be
[1:07:47] embed this woman had nothing to
[1:07:53] clean praise the Lord
[1:07:55] if
[1:07:57] Simon taken an advantage of cleaning the
[1:07:59] feet of
[1:08:05] Jesus had nothing to
[1:08:10] clean nothing to offer to God as a
[1:08:17] service praise the lord we should be
[1:08:21] conscious of how God works in this time
[1:08:27] praise the Lord now for another
[1:08:30] announcement another
[1:08:36] announcement the where we
[1:08:40] read
[1:08:44] Luke you know this
[1:08:49] woman you know I don't have notes so you
[1:08:52] bear with me so this woman
[1:08:57] she was not aware why God Jesus had come
[1:09:00] in her
[1:09:02] life but I
[1:09:07] like the Bible
[1:09:10] says
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:14] first let's go to
[1:09:18] 43 all was going
[1:09:21] on all the girls Jesus saw them wased
[1:09:28] praise the Lord allow me to say like
[1:09:31] this Jesus might have been the first
[1:09:36] there because saw all of these washed
[1:09:39] and cleaned
[1:09:48] and when yes when the function is going
[1:09:51] on he was busy entertaining with his
[1:09:54] guests whom are washed with
[1:09:58] feet and then what happened
[1:10:02] verse and he
[1:10:04] turned the
[1:10:06] woman praise the Lord and He Turned unto
[1:10:11] the
[1:10:12] woman and said unto
[1:10:16] Simon praise the
[1:10:18] Lord thou this
[1:10:21] woman I entered into thine house
[1:10:27] prise the Lord how I love
[1:10:30] this God is testifying to you that I
[1:10:36] have come to
[1:10:38] you praise the Lord come to you I
[1:10:43] entered in your
[1:10:45] house but the problem is you didn't mind
[1:10:49] to clean
[1:10:52] me the Lord the problem another
[1:10:56] you didn't wash my feet you didn't even
[1:11:00] wipe or comb my
[1:11:03] hair comb my hair
[1:11:05] and maybe the wind had made it
[1:11:09] worse you didn't clean it maybe D was on

[1:15:35] this woman she was brought to entertain
[1:15:39] those
[1:15:41] guests she closed her
[1:15:45] business because of the presence of the
[1:15:48] Lord praise the Lord she closed her
[1:15:52] business
[1:15:55] they don't pay me money
[1:15:59] yes after not even entertained
[1:16:04] them praise the
[1:16:06] Lord the whole time she spent it with
[1:16:13] Christ yet she was
[1:16:15] HED dance and entertain
[1:16:25] but we are too
[1:16:28] busy already
[1:16:33] enter not only in the houses because go
[1:16:37] to
[1:16:39] work so he has G onon which we don't
[1:16:43] leave
[1:16:46] home praise the Lord so there's no way
[1:16:49] we can say we don't know
[1:16:53] God unless not part of
[1:16:57] him praise the Lord but people are just
[1:17:00] not
[1:17:04] conscious the are not
[1:17:06] cons God is working things
[1:17:10] out and people are not careful to notice
[1:17:13] the move of
[1:17:16] God praise the Lord the more we are not
[1:17:22] conscious that opportunity the
[1:17:34] never praise the Lord even
[1:17:38] us as I said Christ has entered into our
[1:17:47] houses praise the Lord and
[1:17:51] his even when you don't know that he's
[1:17:54] the one
[1:18:10] iise the Lord we must be
[1:18:15] conscious not to miss this such
[1:18:20] opportun the prophet says the Bible
[1:18:25] has the answers for this
[1:18:30] day and it had all for other
[1:18:38] days praise the Lord the message has the
[1:18:42] answers for this
[1:18:46] day praise the Lord without it you are
[1:18:51] out of the will of God
[1:18:55] and how are you going to serve god
[1:18:57] without
[1:19:00] his that
[1:19:02] message praise the Lord how are you
[1:19:05] going to serve
[1:19:07] God praise the Lord you know there is no
[1:19:11] way you will serve God outside of his
[1:19:16] will because we read last time the
[1:19:20] prophet said that that woman that widow
[1:19:23] woman in the days of
[1:19:27] when
[1:19:28] she
[1:19:31] El when reading the
[1:19:33] Bible the Bible says God told
[1:19:37] Elijah go and she will feed
[1:19:41] you but the
[1:19:43] prophet God s El
[1:19:46] there to feed that
[1:19:53] woman when you the
[1:19:55] Lord is our
[1:19:58] beneficiaries praise the Lord so you
[1:20:01] can't serve God outside of his
[1:20:06] will praise the Lord the prophet said s
[1:20:11] El
[1:20:13] there feed
[1:20:16] that and look at how they will come to
[1:20:19] the presence of
[1:20:21] God how first did for the presence of
[1:20:25] God than
[1:20:26] her she cared for the presence of God
[1:20:29] first than her
[1:20:37] also praise the Lord this woman she
[1:20:42] served the presence of God first before
[1:20:45] her
[1:20:51] routines the Lord and he was in the Pres
[1:20:54] presence that is Simon he was Simon was
[1:20:58] in the presence of
[1:21:02] God praise the
[1:21:05] Lord and that's what it was to
[1:21:09] him it didn't mean
[1:21:13] anything but if he had been
[1:21:19] conscious praise the Lord if Simon was
[1:21:23] conscious the truth
[1:21:26] he would have not missed the presence of
[1:21:28] the
[1:21:30] Lord praise the Lord would have not
[1:21:33] missed that
[1:21:36] presence praise the
[1:21:38] Lord praise the
[1:21:41] Lord
[1:21:43] United if Simon would rise
[1:21:46] up because he already
[1:21:54] and he reads this with
[1:21:56] you and see people not in
[1:22:00] church and see people not careful
[1:22:03] outside
[1:22:04] there and he people not minding the
[1:22:07] family
[1:22:10] altars people don't mind about the
[1:22:12] presence of the Lord when the services
[1:22:14] are open
[1:22:18] here Simon would be for us
[1:22:25] praise the Lord because he would tell
[1:22:29] you Christ is much more revealed to you
[1:22:33] it was in our
[1:22:40] time praise the Lord because in the days
[1:22:43] of
[1:22:43] Simon there was no
[1:22:46] message to tell him Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:50] same yesterday and forever
[1:22:55] after all the one who wrote that
[1:22:58] message he
[1:23:00] was he was not yet
[1:23:06] on
[1:23:08] Lord praise the Lord so when he sees us
[1:23:11] no Christ now when he sees us no Christ
[1:23:18] now the way we know
[1:23:20] him Simon would be for us
[1:23:25] because say an opportunity with you
[1:23:30] people praise the Lord you find young
[1:23:36] people let me have more
[1:23:40] time because you're not looking for
[1:23:46] schooles people not looking for
[1:23:53] food your time wash
[1:24:02] utensils wash
[1:24:04] clothing which I don't think you do
[1:24:06] every
[1:24:08] day which I don't think you do every
[1:24:12] day so there is a lot of
[1:24:14] time but you know it is
[1:24:18] unfortunate that the presence the
[1:24:23] houses Young people don't
[1:24:26] mind praise the lord we don't
[1:24:30] mind how will God use us when we are not
[1:24:34] careful how will God be taking us as
[1:24:37] examples without when we are not
[1:24:39] conscious with his
[1:24:44] word praise the Lord because the
[1:24:47] presence of
[1:24:49] God makes us
[1:24:54] that if they up the
[1:24:58] floor don't again wake up and you
[1:25:09] know how much do you pay for your
[1:25:15] existence praise the Lord but even when
[1:25:19] comes simp
[1:25:25] we are not
[1:25:27] conscious praise the Lord those
[1:25:31] days God came
[1:25:34] down there was fear among the
[1:25:38] people praise the Lord people were
[1:25:43] fearful
[1:25:47] to praise the Lord because one day they
[1:25:51] also wanted to talk to God
[1:25:55] and the was given to
[1:25:57] them the way was
[1:26:00] given praise the
[1:26:02] lord it's okay then wake up
[1:26:10] and when he
[1:26:13] spoke the only person who remained was
[1:26:18] Moses praise the Lord so even us
[1:26:22] now grace of God is our upon
[1:26:26] us to cover the fearfulness of
[1:26:32] God and he's always Among
[1:26:35] Us careful do we notice
[1:26:40] that praise the Lord
[1:26:43] sometimes God
[1:26:46] speaks and tells you and he frames the
[1:26:50] whole situation in one verse
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:56] and he says don't be conformed to this
[1:27:03] world but in the world are not careful
[1:27:07] with
[1:27:10] God but who sustains
[1:27:14] them is good but they not
[1:27:17] careful so we who know
[1:27:20] God that he sustains us to be more
[1:27:26] careful to those people
[1:27:29] out we can show them greater is
[1:27:34] he that is in
[1:27:36] us than in
[1:27:38] you praise the Lord but now we are not
[1:27:43] conscious and that's the problem with
[1:27:46] us so he's in our
[1:27:51] houses let me tell you this
[1:27:54] there is no in your
[1:27:58] house
[1:28:02] unless
[1:28:05] radios the message
[1:28:09] books but then if you are so arant to do
[1:28:14] that then I don't know who you
[1:28:18] are by the time you don't want the Pres
[1:28:21] of
[1:28:24] you may all those
[1:28:26] things but your children have
[1:28:30] phones so you
[1:28:33] can't on the other
[1:28:35] hand says there no way you can wash him
[1:28:39] off
[1:28:43] your
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:47] it Pate knew very well that this is a
[1:28:51] holy
[1:28:52] man is just
[1:28:55] he has not done anything wrong but the
[1:28:58] people
[1:29:00] shouted him to us his blood shall be
[1:29:05] upon us and our
[1:29:08] children
[1:29:11] so let
[1:29:18] meing the prophet
[1:29:20] says even
[1:29:22] pilate has nothing wash
[1:29:27] him
[1:29:31] so'se you can't CH Christ in our
[1:29:35] houses but what do we me to do
[1:29:39] then be
[1:29:41] conscious praise the Lord let us
[1:29:45] notice because every time the presence
[1:29:48] of God Has
[1:29:52] Come notice
[1:29:55] there always a
[1:29:57] blessing why would you like to bless
[1:30:01] me and not
[1:30:03] you praise the Lord let the presence of
[1:30:08] God
[1:30:12] you is andone
[1:30:17] who praise the Lord the blessings of God
[1:30:22] upon you
[1:30:25] me praise the
[1:30:27] Lord praise the
[1:30:29] Lord he's in the
[1:30:31] house and
[1:30:39] you will bring a neighbor who tune him
[1:30:42] and ENT there
[1:30:48] byce will hear
[1:30:51] him even when you don't
[1:30:55] by the time you got on radio on
[1:31:00] Friday you find
[1:31:05] Talking where
[1:31:08] will is
[1:31:11] everywhere praise the Lord praise the
[1:31:15] lord we must be
[1:31:17] conscious that's why we should live a
[1:31:22] life
[1:31:24] of the
[1:31:26] gopel any place we are
[1:31:30] in God is ready to take us from that
[1:31:35] point to take
[1:31:39] us don't think will take us in the
[1:31:42] Rapture when we in
[1:31:47] church praise the Lord because others
[1:31:50] will be in the
[1:31:52] F others will be
[1:31:56] harvesting others be B
[1:32:00] sleep praise the so there's no way you
[1:32:05] deny
[1:32:07] Christ in your
[1:32:10] houses
[1:32:16] heer what we meant to
[1:32:18] do let us be
[1:32:21] conscious praise the Lord
[1:32:24] let us be
[1:32:25] conscious and while we are
[1:32:28] conscious the truth
[1:32:30] is
[1:32:33] Christ will give us the need of his
[1:32:38] coming praise the Lord he will give it
[1:32:41] to
[1:32:42] us praise the
[1:32:44] Lord praise the
[1:32:47] Lord
[1:32:50] so the prophet
[1:32:52] says I to
[1:32:58] finish the prophet says
[1:33:01] here now it looked like I like this
[1:33:08] one I like
[1:33:10] this I've read this quot almost now this
[1:33:12] is the third
[1:33:15] time it looked
[1:33:18] like that he was sent to take away the
[1:33:22] little she had
[1:33:31] it he was sent to take what little she
[1:33:39] had but it was vice
[1:33:45] versa praise the
[1:33:48] Lord praise the Lord it looked like when
[1:33:53] God said
[1:33:56] there he went to eat the last meal of
[1:34:00] this
[1:34:04] woman
[1:34:07] there after he had drunk BR and it was
[1:34:13] dried and it dried up and he left that
[1:34:18] place praise the Lord God sends him
[1:34:21] where there is water
[1:34:24] but the prophet says it was the last
[1:34:28] meal but it looked like he was sent to
[1:34:32] take away the little she
[1:34:36] had the
[1:34:45] praise the Lord does this mean
[1:34:49] now when God came in the house of Simon
[1:34:56] he didn't come to eat his
[1:35:01] Mar praise the Lord that wasn't his
[1:35:04] intention of
[1:35:06] going praise the Lord but instead it was
[1:35:11] vice
[1:35:13] versa praise the Lord he wanted
[1:35:19] there that's why he confused them not to
[1:35:24] care for
[1:35:25] him so that the S which is
[1:35:30] conscious
[1:35:32] careful and when that is
[1:35:36] careful what purose we may think brought
[1:35:40] Christ
[1:35:44] there Canal life
[1:35:48] again praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:35:52] and then he says the prophet
[1:35:55] when she was willing to give what she
[1:35:58] had to support the
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:05] word praise the Lord when she was
[1:36:10] willing to give what she had in support
[1:36:13] of the
[1:36:15] word Prophet
[1:36:18] says who thought he was going to take
[1:36:21] the thing which he had
[1:36:32] instead praise the Lord you
[1:36:37] now the church now if you are willing to
[1:36:42] give What Spirit you do
[1:36:47] have what spirit that God give you to
[1:36:50] support of the word
[1:36:56] the prophet
[1:36:58] says
[1:37:00] then keep you
[1:37:04] alive praise the Lord then will keep you
[1:37:09] alive because what you're giving him it
[1:37:13] is his
[1:37:15] already praise the Lord you're using his
[1:37:20] to serve
[1:37:21] him praise the Lord
[1:37:24] the life it is God
[1:37:27] is the strength it is God
[1:37:31] is praise the Lord and the
[1:37:35] Heart it's God
[1:37:38] is that's why the Bible says Ser the
[1:37:42] Lord with all thine
[1:37:46] heart all thy
[1:37:49] Soul all th strength
[1:37:53] praise the Lord he
[1:37:58] saying but the prophet
[1:38:00] says gives it to
[1:38:04] you praise the Lord so you use it to
[1:38:08] serve
[1:38:11] him praise the
[1:38:14] Lord
[1:38:19] now so the rest of
[1:38:22] them the rest of
[1:38:25] them the prophet says when the rest of
[1:38:28] them when the rest of the world was
[1:38:34] languishing just down praise the Lord
[1:38:37] when the rest of them was
[1:38:48] languishing yeah there when the rest of
[1:38:52] them of the world was
[1:38:54] anguishing and ding
[1:38:57] in and dying in hunger her and her
[1:39:01] children household all ate three good
[1:39:05] meals a
[1:39:10] day praise the Lord and then the prophet
[1:39:14] says divine revelation on the
[1:39:18] word I you see it friends what went on
[1:39:23] stayed there that's
[1:39:25] El until thein was
[1:39:28] over living with this
[1:39:31] woman this
[1:39:33] church that received
[1:39:36] him and believed his
[1:39:39] word praise the Lord Simon never
[1:39:43] received Christ never believed the
[1:39:47] word never never kept him
[1:39:53] the
[1:39:54] Lord he never kept
[1:39:57] him but he says and he kept her alive
[1:40:01] because of doing
[1:40:05] that he kept the church
[1:40:08] Alive by the word of the
[1:40:12] Lord because he
[1:40:15] said that says the
[1:40:18] Lord praise the Lord now
[1:40:25] let me end with
[1:40:32] this now this is another quote the first
[1:40:36] thing you taken the first thing taken
[1:40:40] place when they got down
[1:40:44] there the first thing taken
[1:40:47] place when they got down
[1:40:50] there the prophet says
[1:40:56] lot got in
[1:40:58] trouble and the prophet says why he was
[1:41:02] out of he was out of the will of
[1:41:08] God that's lot and then the prophet says
[1:41:12] he was out of the will of
[1:41:14] God and then if
[1:41:18] you get in
[1:41:21] trouble when you if you get in
[1:41:25] trouble when the I want to see
[1:41:30] this he says yes that when

[1:41:39] in where did we start
[1:41:42] from if you get in
[1:41:44] trouble when you are in the will of
[1:41:49] God the prophet says God
[1:41:53] will help you
