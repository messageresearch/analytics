grant these prayers in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen and amen praise the lord we can have our sisters what is your greatest desire praise the Lord before you could have a desire almighty God prepared everything knowing your path the way that you will take whatever would happen in your life praise the Lord and they will need everything that you are going to be everything that I was going to be was already in him and because it was already in him his love affairs for him and you Eddie and he said is that we may Delight in him because everything we have need of this day is already prepared in Christ before the foundation that is his design when he began expressing The Fountain Of Love In the Beginning by creating his first son broke down praise the Lord his eternal path was already in God but his flesh so whatever God was going to speak here on Earth concerned his body praise the Lord [Music] so that the things that God [Music] to come the mind of the the program of his father was in here because man cannot make a program we have to be about our father's business we have to respond the same word that is attribute Sons and Daughters of God because it is the mind of the one who knows that same mind spoke that word comes back later and that's a mind it's the same words cause it is but because [Music] [Music] in a message the word made flesh [Music] praise the Lord the word made flesh can begin from verse 23. this is what the prophet says for verily I say unto you that whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be moved and be thou cast into the sea monanda and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he's saying shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says sorry okay fine what I was reading is a scripture connected to that question but the word became flesh 54 10 0 3 m 54 10 0 3 m M India reports 175 175 he says when Jesus no wonder when Jesus yes no wonder when he came off the hill that night he looked around that tree for food there was no there was no food on the tree of God and he said no man shall eat he went on a way yeah on the next day coming back that tree had with us God's mind the mind that was in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ that same one was expressing that word back again are we there today praise the Lord now 176 he says is God's thoughts foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] now now would it if the Same Spirit why am I annoying that said the Aquaman let there be light and there was light yeah come on let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mind that was in Christ how much more could it says now if that same spirit let there be like and there was life that said let there be trees and if that same mind that was in Christ how much could it say let there be no cancer it would be good let the blind eyes it's your thoughts those of you Jesus say yes that was Jesus but 180 but if it becomes a real revelation of God but you see it before it happens and express it in word form that word becomes materials a thought expressed Hallelujah you are mine those are you is so and filled with God's spirit your thoughts are you become his thoughts when your mind you are guiding becomes a direct place over direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal beings praise the Lord now just the same way God's purpose was to be expressed that the expression of our thoughts has nothing to do with your reasoning is nothing to do with your thinking Hallelujah one so it has to be a revelation it has to be a work that God has worked and that works if that work is revealed to you that work becomes the mind of God form the things that God has already said how much I can think [Music] of this morning if by the grace of God can reveal to me God can reveals made in the form of the word hallelujah God does anything you see he has to foreign a flash flesh and send us a giftable and that gift is all that God has worked that gift given to us it's true whatever has the power to open the seat Hallelujah not you do you not me David it is a work more that almighty God has done revealed to you if you can receive God has what extraternity given to you then the same mind of The God Who works and the works that he did we'll repeat again how many understandings may God help me this morning push only one thought um only one thought it has to be what God has already worked but it will work the works of God Among Us foreign such the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but it is the scripture that speak that I am those scriptures I would wish to go back to Adam and yes all that God worked he put it in word form yeah foreign yes a manifestation of the entire word of God made flesh and when he was saying he said porn porn Rock I will build my church what is that wrong a revelation not what what a man has done questions [Music] if it is given to you it will work the same thing because it is foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign had to leave the life of a redeemer yeah Jesus Christ to Manifest this redempts no wonder in the place that we read foreign that that fig tree would be and he also knew yamana the position 34 where that fig tree would be uh [Music] true victory is not victory that you see do you know how much it is what God spoke or many understand predict together is the word of God Jesus Christ foreign foreign by taking it back fig tree in this position and as long as that fig tree remains there it remains a fig tree by what God's foreign but when that foreign will not live by eating matoke alone but we live right now by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God and what when that word electrical which proceeds from the mouth Our Lives itself with you which is listen when that word that comes from the mouth of God aligns itself with him you also become alive foreign [Music] now [Music] it is the desire of God it is the desire of God we all here wants to align me he spoke not about me and in there in there over is all my desires met normally okay Hallelujah coming to me is all that is but there is one thing I have to do Channel I have to have a revelation it was the person of the word that has been sent to me it is a it is not a thought to know also the word is a living article is why Jesus Christ says my words [Music] foreign [Music] I mean [Music] [Music] who did not even hear the words that foreign [Music] no no please [Music] to a work that God has done for them as long as the people can see not a man see what God has worked and receive the work of God in their lives did when it was here Hallelujah pointing the people hallelujah to that gifts he is here there is no need for me to pray for the sins that the article I'm introducing you to um because it is [Music] we'll meet their desires that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but we will live Hallelujah [Music] promise yes crystal is the seed of the woman amen blocked the light yes was to live the entire Redemption life of Jesus Christ through the church Jesus yes the one who lived in the East was to reproduce himself through the church again could reproduce himself whether as the Holy Ghost himself to live there is a life of redemption for saving Church edges because that is who [Music] in a virgin body who came in a sinless body they don't belong to me that same Jesus reproduced in the church will give new bodies praise the Lord now it was in God that He Lives the entirety of redemption so that at the end of times the husband one the Redeemer um may leave his where are you foreign [Music] and bring it among us foreign [Music] foreign [Music] that was in the beginning Hallelujah because it was the working of Almighty [Music] Hallelujah when he was commissioned the angel told him right are you ready are you ready you will make the people to believe because article of the working of God he might not know to quote the scripture but he knows the god of that scripture very well [Music] he doesn't need to be educated it was the working of God who has a revelation what happened in the beginning it is not about him it is a work of God I will not believe me today given given signs to make to make us believe if what we could desire Hallelujah Hallelujah because if he has to restore only the word can restore and here is the way foreign quiet him silica Hallelujah then a spirit will come upon him he asks which is that spirit said it will be Christ and you only speak the ABC people he's just a man but when he holds the man that disease recognize the gift and that disease through the stretched hand of God moves if you want to leave your disease do you believe that God touches the hand is normal now that's what happened during the time of Moses when God come into Moses give him the gifts foreign hand of God when it is brought back it is something famous because nothing to do with Moses in order for him to do that your pleasure he has to leave the entirety of redemption [Music] that will be the seventh age foreign foreign so all that he worked for six ages so that his message it has nothing to do with this mind it is a working of God a gift of God may receive d [Music] cause gifts I see a woman amen maybe in this age it might be different I don't know today Hallelujah this man coming with many visitors the normal woman would say don't you know I also get tired [Music] but to this woman it was a delight the reason when brother Branham came with his friends to him that's all that he desires home he started speaking of something that God had done and this woman it was not a work of that day he always was delighting herself with the word he loved that man you loved that game everything to me so when he gave the testimony that Eternal thought that greatest if her Delight will be for the Lord you can never understand the things of God until you get a desire I'm so happy to hear my pastor friend tell you as I am preaching go back and read the message the bridge because you have to be in the same continuity you have to be delighting with the same things all that when Christ prays to Hallelujah anointing comes on the same time the things foreign foreign
