allowing us to be in your presence again in the name of Jesus Christ I pray amen God bless you all I want to appreciate the pastor for the opportunity once again to preach the word of God tonight do you love him amen amen so let's start our Bibles in the book of Colossians 3:3 we shall read out one verse and then we shall turn to the book of 2 Chronicles the Bible says in Colossians 3:3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in you are dead and your life is with Christ in God 2 chonicles 4 verse one he made an altar of brass 20 cubits the length thereof and 20 cubits the breadth thereof and 10 cubits the height thereof verse furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and the doors of the court and overlay the doors of them with brass may the Lord add a blessing to his word we may get seated amen amen I want once again to welcome you to the word this evening amen amen so now we have read from the book of Colossians the position of the believer the position of the Bride is in Christ it's not that talk about the altars that talk about the courts praise the Lord that made up the entire Temple bu the temple of God from the first part the second part and the third part praise the Lord and now we know that this Temple consisted of three courts praise the Lord it had the outer Court it had the middle and innermost and each of those Courts for a purpose praise the Lord and each of them served a purpose and remember when when God was giving instructions to Moses in the book of lus how the people would be reconciled to God we see how God instructed Moses that if any of them the children of Israel after they had crossed over if any of them was convicted of sin if they were convicted praise the Lord they were given a time in a year to have an atonement for their sins so he told them let them get a Bullock and they shall bring it before the priest and they shall lay their hands upon the bulock and they shall confess their sins upon it and then the priest would offer The Bu for sacrifice unto the Lord and then the blood would be poured would be sprinkled as a symbol of covering the sins of the people so now in the first court of the temple that Solomon built unto the Lord is where the people gathered those that were convicted were gathered in there and the People Prayed there people fasted praise the Lords or Jews whoever had the call and the conviction of was gathered out there to pray so they brought their sacrifices they brought their Bullocks and presented it over to the priest praise the Lord consecrated their lives they put their lives they put their sins all their convictions and the convictions of the entire household upon the bulock of the animal and they made confessions praise the Lord and out there when they did that they continued in supplication and prayer in the outer Court the people were always gathered there were praying praise the Lord waiting to see if their prayers would be accepted of God and they prayed out there so then the priests they got the sacrifice and they sprinkled blood upon the altar praise the Lord remember it has started from the outer Court it started with conviction in the outer Court it it started with prayers in the outer Court in the outer Court praise the Lord then in the middle court at the altar blood is being sprinkled blood is being sprinkled the priest sprinkling blood trying to atone for the sins of the people then there was a high priest who was accepted only the high priest will be accepted praise the Lord now to get this Blood of the people and proceed over to the innermost Court to the holy of holies praise the Lord and the people out there Contin to pray they could they were in that moment of Supplication praise the Lord they were interceding while the high priest moved to the inner to the holy of holies with with their with their offerings while he took their prayers before God praise the Lord and when he crossed into the innermost Court he presented the prayers of the Saints before God praise the Lord and presented their prayers before the Altar and the altar in the innermost Court was built differently praise the Lord it has special Futures it had cherubims whose wings were joined around protecting the altar because in there dwell the presence of God in the holy of holies dwell the presence of God the seat that's where praise the Lord the high priest brought the the prayers of of the people laid them there praise the Lord to ask God accept the prayers of the people so now we see something here we see the people praise the Lord on the outside we see the people in the outer Court praying to be forgiven and then here is the high priest moved with their prayers from outside he gets into the middle court then he proceeds in the holy of holies carrying the burdens of the people and trying to plead with God to see if he would forgive the people at that time all the burdens of the people were put upon the priest and if God did not accept their prayers it meant the the life of the of the high priest would end praise the Lord so much he was taking their prayers but the enti of the people see three parts here we see the outer Court we see the middle cour and the innermost court and I want to say something here The Life of a Christian the life of anyone is composed of three elements praise the Lord it has the skin fulfilling it it has the nose and now this body here praise the Lord has also a purpose in our lives then we have the next part that is the spirit praise the Lord what the body has [Applause] heard the spirit meditates upon [Music] meditates upon it so in the spirit praise the Lord begins to draw [Music] contentions praise the Lord when you hear something you now take it to the heart and then begin to say but my heart was telling me ABCD my heart was telling me not go but yet you're not speaking out so that means there is a second part of you praise the Living God which is which also plays a part in your life praise the Lord then when the spirit receives it praise the Lord when the spirit accepts it praise the Lord now it now proceeds from the spirit and it gets now down to the soul praise the Lord so now depending on the kind of seed which has entered through the ears or through the body to the to the spirit andto the heart soul the fruits that a man shall bear depend on what they have conceived in their spirit and fed into their soul so now when we draw back to the Leviticus when the people got convicted of sin they had to confess so they confessed by the body the mouth had confessed that I have sinned why because their spirit is convicted of sin praise the Lord so when they confessed they desire to be delivered of their sin they desire to be reconciled back to God praise the Living God so now when they prayed their Spirit was pting to be set free was pting to be set free and I want to liken this to the life of a Believer praise the lord we know that when we hear the word of God we hear by our senses the bodys US to hear the [Applause] word and now the spirit when it receives the word from the body it begins Med upon this word praise the Lord upon the word and when it is convinced that it is the truth praise the the word now settles down in the soul of man and when it settles in the soul of man praise the Lord it now begins to work upon this man to transform them to make them a better person so man receives the word of God by the five senses of the body and when the word is received in the spirit or in the heart it then proceeds over to the soul and it makes in the soul so now remember when the high priest took the prayers of the Saints and he reached into the inner chamber the holy of holies he began to plead with God in there praise the Lord and now for the testimony to come out for the people to be convinced that their sins have been forgiven the high priest had to come back the high priest had to move back back from the holy of hly through the middle the where people are waiting from so we see two processes here praise the Lord the first process is moving from the outer Court through the midd cour to the most the inner Court and the second process is again leaving the inner the most inner Court through the middle court back to the outer court and when the people saw the high priest back they cated they were happy they knew that their prayers have been answered it was a testimony that God has accepted them that God has pardoned their their prayers their sins praise the name of the Living God thank you brother you're welcome brother amen bless you so now in the innermost Court which is typing the soul God is aboard where God sits where the presence of God sits in our lives praise the Lord it is a point praise the Lord that God has chosen to make an abort so when you hear the word of God you hear by your ears praise the Lord then you accept by your and when you accept the word of God in your heart it begins to work upon you it begins to prune you praise the Lord so now the outer coat I want call it the point ofation because that's the point where we are convicted of sin and we accept that we have sin and we need salvation that's when we get the offering come and present it to the to the the priest praise the Lord And now when we make our confessions because the Bible say the instructions that God gave unto Moses he says when a soul sin that Soul shall bring a bulock and when they bring a bullock they shall lay their hands upon and they shall make confession and then the high priest shall get it and they shall offer it unto the Lord praise the Lord so now that point where you bring the Bullock you accepted that you have seen and you need salvation that's the point of justification because when you bring your offering Justified it is taken away from you but it does not over prise the Lord even when the blood was sprinkled in the mid Court as long as the high priest has not entered into the in in the innermost Court the sins of the people have not been forgiven so now I want to say this that in the middle court is where we find we find sanctification praise the Lord the cleansing the blood of the Bullock the blood of the sheep and the animals to cover the sins of the people praise the Lord the blood covering up our sins praise the Lord but that's not over we need to go a step higher so when you receive the word of God praise the Lord you accepted it it is good but it's not good enough when you accept it and you confess it you are Justified praise the Lord and then when it gets to the to the heart and is doing a cleansing and you're being Obed to the word praise the Lord you allow the word of God proceed to the soul praise the Lord and when it gets into the soul Christ makes in you praise the Lord and when he makes in you where the life of God is praise the Lord it does not settle there praise the Lord it has to come from the inside out why it must manifest the fruits of the Holy Spirit to show that you are born of God that's why the high priest would not stay there forever to move moov from the holy of holies to the outer Court to manifest the testimony to manifest that it is finished praise the Lord so when you receive the word of God when you obey the word of God it gets to our souls again comes back from the soul praise the Lord because we have got a consolation we have been sealed receive the Life of Christ in your hearts praise the Lord you have received your seal you been forgiven and now you have received salvation praise the Lord now there salvation which is the life of God which is the word of God again comes from the soul to the heart make you obedience and it must manifest the outside to make the body of obedience the leadership of the spirit praise the Lord such that you are able to Bear the truths of the spirit praise the Lord why the Bible says that we must be a living episode how shall we be a living episode when the word is only stored in the soul and the life is not manifesting on the outside the Lord so the life that we have does not allow it to settle in the soul the high priest was excited that the prayers of the Saints have been accepted of God so he ran back and he moved to come and bring the testimony when you receive the word of God in your soul you must testify praise the Lord you must that the people are able to see Christ that the people are able to see and make a reference that you are born of Jesus Christ praise the Lord you must manifest The Life of Christ in you praise the Lord he carried the blood and he came back and sto the people that your sins have been forgiven praise the Lord so now the three are a type of the life of of the life of a Believer the outside Court where we find the justification and in the in the middle court is where we find our sacrifice Jesus Christ praise the Lord when God sent him down die for the sins of man praise the Lord the Bible says he B all the burdens of men and the Bible says he is our high priest praise the Lord so now he not just our sacrifice but he at the same time high priest praise the Lord so now when he bore our sins when he Bears our sins when he Bears our iniquities when he Bears all our transgressions and our weaknesses praise the Lord he now takes them over to offer himself before God as a sacrifice to atone for our sins and because to atone for sins there must be a symbol of blood blood must be shed that's why the animals were killed and the blood was poured upon that's why God chose Jesus the person of Jesus to die for the sins of man he had to be offered as a sacrifice and as a sacrifice he had to pour his own blood praise the Lord and when he poured his own blood blood cleanses us that blood covers all our cleanses all our weakness and out of the blood of Jesus Christ out of the blood of Jesus proceeded a life praise the Lord they proceeded the life the life of God the life of God came out of the blood of Jesus and now when the life came out of it the life was given to each one of us praise the Lord it was given to each one of us life what settles in our souls and then you get that life which is the word of God when you get that life which is the Life of Christ in your life you have eternal life and you have found your position in Jesus Christ praise the Lord that's why in colians 3: at that point you are dead praise the Lord you are dead yourself and now your life is he in Christ why when you receive the word of God and you're Justified proceeds to your heart and begins pruning you prise the Lord you begin to reject your life you begin to reject your desires in other words you're becoming dead yourself and you allowing that life of God that life of Jesus Christ to take over your life praise the Lord And now when you are fully clean he gives you that life the life that proceeds out of the blood of Jesus Christ and that life comes and settles in the soul and once the life is given in your soul the word settles in your soul you have salvation why it is the seal the B calls it the seal the day of our Redemption praise the Lord so believing God confessing is good it's not good enough because it does not save your soul the word which we have received must enter into our hearts and penetrate to the soul and make an AB there that's when you receive the life of God praise the lord and there is no human being that ever receive the life of God you will ever set home praise the Lord you become Restless you need to show what you have believed once that life is born in your life praise the Lord you want to show someone else what you have received that's why you must testify again tesy does not mean we shall go all of us and preach praise the Lord the life that you live itself testifies of the goodness of the lord of the Salvation of God allow God to take over your life you become dead yourself and your life is hid behind CHR and Christ himself come out comes out to live your life that's says your life is hidden Christ with Christ why because when you he died he picked his life and he gave it over to you so now got your life and he put it behind his life that he himself may be manifested in your life praise the name Living God and now he gives us promises praise the Lord when he has given us a part of when he has given us his life through the blood of Jesus Christ which she poured upon the cross which cleanses us daily of our Sports praise the Lord he gives us the Assurance of rest to rest and allow God to take over so you rest of yourself in other words we become dead and we must be dead for Christ to manifest praise the Lord the animal had to be dead blood to come out Jesus had to die on the cross and his blood had to come out of his for us to receive the life out of the blood praise the Lord and we have that Assurance the Assurance of Eternal rest because the life of God which is eternal life dwells in our souls and as as long as it dwells in Us Praise the Lord as long as God dwells in us we find our positions in Christ we don't find our positions in the church we don't find our positions in anywhere else we find our position in Christ how because when he took over our lives the day we con the day we are ConEd confessed praise the Lord he took us up praise the Lord and then presented himself as a sacrifice to die for all our sins and the Bible says all our sins are now forgotten all our weaknesses are now forgotten why because Christ Came Upon Our confession and he took took over our lives and he put our lives behind him and presented himself upon the cross as a sacrifice out of the cross out of his blood came the life that we live out of that sacrifice came the word of God his life unto our soul praise the Lord that is the word that is the spoken the gospel of peace the eternal life himself that proceeds from the life of God himself to the soul of man and once it is there it seals us and gives us the Assurance to rest until the day of our Redemption so shall the people know that you are my disciples why because you have my life you are in me and I am in you Christ in you and you in Christ the hope of glory praise the Lord and once we have the testimony once we have the testimony of the life of God we have the Assurance to overcome praise the Lord you rest it does not mean we shall not get into distress distress will come but you have the Assurance of over because Jesus overcame the world and if he lives in you you have also overcome the world praise the lord the devil may try to manifest he may try to condemn and bring condemnations praise the Lord but we have the assurance that as long as we in Christ there is now no condemnation praise the Lord all sins are forgiven all sports are cleansed Life of Christ we have a testimony that we have Christ we have a testimony that we have received him praise the name Living God and now remember when Jesus was moving over he did not bear some but he B all our bur part of your all our sin all our iniquities all burdens anything that Satan will rise before us us Christ carried it over praise the Lord that's why at some point when he was taking the sacrifice he knew that himself was the sacrifice and he was moving over as was reaching the altar when the sacrifice was to be offered he saw himself there being sacrificed and the burdens were so heavy when he looked down when he looked back from eternity and he saw all the sins that man had committed from Adam praise the Lord and then he looked a far off to see all our bur all our challenges every sin that we would go through and he brought all of them together became very heavy he say God I be in position to carry this over praise the Lord and he cried out to God and say if it is possible let this cup be taken away from me praise the Lord he was the sacrifice that God was offering then he looked at himself and the way that he was carrying says is heav is possible manage to overc then Christ heard the voice of God and God showed him the purpose etal purpose of God and when Christ heard the voice of God it is my will and my good pleasure I present you a as a perfect sacrifice for the sins of people that they may be reconciled back to me then he says father not my will but let your will be done praise the Lord he yeld the will of God praise the Lord in the middle court we yield to the will of God that point of of of of of cleansing that point of sanctification when we are being Sanctified we must yield to the will of God praise the Lord and say father this seems be too much let your will be done it is in his good pleasure that we get to that point praise the Lord and the prophet says that at at some time God allows us to come to that point that you may get into a deeper relationship and fellowship with God Can Jesus father I know it is too heavy for me to carry but let your will be done and when Christ did that the will of God took over and when we do that we will make that confession and know that whatever we are is for us we surrender I recogize your work in me I recognize your presence in my life and I want your will to be done now let God exalt himself above the weaknesses you allow God to exalt himself above your iniquities even when the brings them up as a condemnation you reference the words and say but Christ said when he died upon the cross there shall be no more condemnation because all my condemnation was put upon Him Father let your will be done God says move on it is my will that I present you as a sacrifice move on strike the mark of your call moments like that recognize your position in Christ and move forward and recognize that Christ is there present with you why because he made a promise toed accepted the words and he gave you a part of it so if he has given me part of him he is with you and your life not a part of your life but your life is with him praise the Lord so when the devil begins to move around when the adversary moving around look for whom to conquer Christ is present with you when you get afraid of what has happened you say God I know you're with me manifest yourself you confess why you recogize your position in Christ and know that it is no longer you that is living because your life you got dead praise the Lord you died and God Christ himself is the one leaving when you now come to that point and he say father I know I am going through this I have this weakness but I know you gave me a promise I di to myself praise the Lord I am dead and I know that I am dead come manifest yourself then he rises up he comes up and anyhow you may not know how you've overcome gives you the victory why you have recognized your position in him that's all he demands of us organize our position praise the Lord in every moment of Life recognize that your life is in Christ that your life is hidden with Christ so if your life is hidden with Christ What then shall we say What then shall we say about these things that's what Paul says in the Book of Romans chter 8se 31 around 38 What then shall we say these things what shall we say when they come up what shall we say Christ died Christ came and he died for our sin blood is still flesh upon the altar praise the Lord you recognize that the blood is still flesh upon the so when the enemy takes you to fall you look back to the Altar and say the blood is still flesh upon the altar then you run to the Altar and present praise the Lord you present yourself I say Here I Am wash me Father your blood is still flesh upon cleans me the enemy has brought this spot cleans me why he leaves his blood there because it is in his promises that he must present us as a church that must not have any wrinkles do not have any sports so when the sports fall in our lives you back to him I say father I recognize my position in you and I know that your blood he still is still flesh and your grace is still sufficient to cleanse me of my spot then when you confess when you speak to him he is very F to forgive praise the Lord if it is a moment of difficulty he said father is a difficult moment it is a difficult moment for me to overcome yet I know that you overcame the world and because you overcame the world I also overcome why he took all our B through the cross praise the Lord what we have to do recognize your position in the word and confess and wait on the Lord praise the Lord he says his blood is still flesh to help us overcome sin to wash every spot forgive every sinner to place whoever believes into their positions in Christ Jesus when he when he offered himself as a sacrifice he gave us a part of him that's why praise the Lord on the day of Pentecost we read the Bible tells us that he came down and now this time when he came down that life that came out of the blood Calvary came back on the day of Pentecost and it fell upon each of them praise the Lord that life is still present with us praise the Lord and his Desir praise the Lord to move from our hearts deep to the soul to make his AB in there and when he makes an AB in our soul he begins to work on us he gives us Assurance he says you've overcome because I've overcome he says you shall be healed because I who sits in you I am the Lord God who heal all your diseases and then he says me who you have believed who sits in your soul just believe and follow my word all things shall be added un you just Place yourself in that position and recognize and say father I have obeyed your word I have believed your word and stay in your words your word never failed you gave your word Abraham and you made it come to pass you gave your word Jacob and it came to pass you gave your wordid and it came to I have now come praise the Lord I have followed your word your words and here is my need you've always fulfilled your promises I have my need and now here is your promise that I just have to follow you and the rest of the things shall be added unto me now I desire to have this if it is in his good will he shall make it come to pass why you have made him a part of you praise the Lord youve made him a part of you in your soul and if he's a part of you his duty bound to fulfill his promises praise the Lord God in Christ reconciling us to himself helping usize our position in him God through Christ blessing us blessing the believer blessing praise the Lord blessing the believer blessing the bride his position in Christ through Jesus Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world himself that was his Temple then that body for sin that body for sin our sins was St apart his flesh RI ripped in two the blood vessels was broken and as the Spirit come from his body then all believers hope you see it all believers that come through the blood into the body of Jesus Christ worships God through the the shed blood of Jesus when they are positionally placed in Christ how do we get in first Corinthians 12 verse3 for by one Spirit are we all baptized in one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be born or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit look how do we get to Christ how do we get to Christ by one Spirit not even one fellow the first thing comes first by one Church no by one letter no by one Creed no but by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body not by water not by power not by might by the spirit one Spirit we are all baptized where does the spirit stay where is life in the blood coming through the blood of Christ the Holy Spirit making an abort in the S of a believer to positionally place them in Christ praise the Lord at one time he was being tested he was being tortured but recognized his position praise the Lord that's why he says the skin worms what a confession the skin worms eat up this body yet in my flesh I shall see the Lord praise the Lord what a confession that even when theil even when even when the devil has brought this difficulty has brought this condemnation brought up a fight even if it is death I know that I shall see my gods he was positionally placed and he had the assurance that even if his body was eaten up he know that he had a body he had another body his soul was a living one and he would see God praise the Lord he says in job 19 verse 26 my skin warms and though my skin warms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God he sits in there in the soul and that Soul shall not die that Soul shall praise the Lord that Soul shall live through if it means fire it shall live through the fire if it means flood it shall live through the flood that Soul shall live to see God why because the life of God the word of God even Christ himself made an abort in that Soul praise the Lord for that reason we have the Assurance of eternal life praise the lord we have the Assurance of eternal life because the word of God lives in our Souls praise the Lord cast th burdens upon the Lord why you are in Christ praise the Lord when the B come up they you don't they don't belong to you they're not yours when they come up get them cast them unto the Lord why it is a promise he took all the burdens and that's why when the spirit of the Lord Came Upon upon David in the Psalms 55 it says cast all thy burdens to the Lord whatever burden you have in your life as a believer recane position and cast that burden the Lord and He Shall sustain you he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved praise the Lord cast all the bur we are righteous because he lives in US you overcome the world not because of your personal strength not because of your wisdom but because he Bel in you praise the Lord and without Christ you are nothing without Christ we are nothing but with Christ we are more than conquerors with Christ we shall strike to Eternity John 15 verse Jesus said I am Divine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same brings forth much fut for without me you can do nothing but with him Jesus Christ the Lord he says without me you can do nothing how much can we do if we have him all things become possible if we have Christ All Things become possible when we recognize our position in Christ praise the Lord Ephesians 2 ver6 and therefore he has raised us up together and made us see together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when you receive him he raises us up together and make us SE together Heaven places seated in heaven places our bodies be here yet our Spirits are seated in Heavenly places because the life that lives on the inside is Heavenly it is Christ is and if it is Christ is praise the Lord in Heavenly places so now when we are here on Earth he sustains us he does not allow us to suffer it doesn't allow the righteous to suffer praise the Lord you gain confidence praise the Lord you are strong enough to face the devil on all grounds by the word of God because it is life it is an overcomer praise the Lord has the part overcome praise the Lord you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in an assurance of our position our lives are hidden in Christ that's where our position is praise the Lord the world may look for wealth the world may look for all whatever it can afford Bri their position is not in the wealth of the world their position is in Christ Jesus their position is in the word of God praise the Lord and as long as our position in the Lord we shall get all the wealth that we desire because it is a promise the source of wealth and we have followed his wording our position the rest of the things shall follow let's make confession and let us believe we are dead in Christ Jesus and we become new creatures all things are passed away the blood cleanses us and washes away all and gives us a new life therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new cre all things are passed away behold All Things become new even if the adversary comes in there is no condemnation that can be put [Music] to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the will of God after the will of the spirit and the prophet says now if we can find our oppos and know that it is God's word that has promised it oh that settles it you know he's talked about us throughout the scriptures he has talked about us there is a bride and this bride shall not have any spot or wrink that settles it the bride shall not have spot you look at your spot you cast it upon the Lord you look at your weaknesses Get It cast it upon the Lord for he cares wash us make us clean and present us before him praise the Lord you get bured into his word you get buried into his what which form your thoughts and imaginations and finally form a character the character of the Lord Jesus that's why when you receive the word and it has made an AB in your soul the word then makes its way out to manifest the character of Christ praise the Lord and we become a living episode to which men make references that's the reason Joshua and C had no fear that they could not take the promised land because all the rest of them said we can't do it why those cities are World high and we look like grasshoppers upside arm and said we just can't do it they were looking at the sense of reason they were still at the outer Court they were still being by the outer Court they had not recognized their position in Christ praise the Lord but jhua and they had the Revelation they had received the instruction had received the promises and the word had made an AB in their hearts and it was in their souls and they were convinced that the word which was on the side of them had the part over no we can overcome we shall take up the land because it is the promise recognizing your position in Christ you can claim Every Blessing there is in the word once you recogize and appreciate your position in Christ says and the revelation of God had brought the word of God manifested and now they was ready to push into the promised land they reced their position took their stand and believed God believe every promise and that settled you don't have to worry about take up your position you have belied you have the words you have the Assurance of the life of God in you if you have the Assurance you take your position in Christ and that settles every promise in the book is mine praise the Lord every promise in the Bible is mine when you get to a need you reference the scriptures and you find that promise there I say God every promise in this book is mine I take up this promise and you believe it no matter how long it takes that settles it just keep believing and you surrender it over unto the Lord for he cares he shall sustain us cast all your cares upon the Lord sustain you shall not let the right suffer praise the Lord I wish I had time I will tell you a simple testimony let me give it you in five minutes praise the Lord one time I was in school in high school in my level and I was I was a head boy and at the same time the leader in the scpt so now one time I was preaching on Su and then the B comes in the school had just changed management and now those that were there had left and I was on scholarship they given me a scholarship in the school so now the B comes in and she was on trousers she was on trousers and I was I was preaching about Christ and and and his wife Christ and bright I never mentioned about anything to do with trouser but the woman got so convicted and she was so pissed yes when she moved out she brought other people from the fellowship my fellow leaders in the scripture and she asked them what I believe and what I have been preaching and some of them we have been with them from senior one up Senor six and I had preached to them all the way they told her but he believes what we believe and she told them that man has a weird it is so weird and it is wrong and he should be careful so they never believed her so they said make programs and I am going to become your your your like your leader Patron over so she began dictating who should preach and now when the people demanded the rest of the school sto fellowshipping because of what the preachers were preaching so I got back and started preaching and when I preached she got conviced she stopped felling and now she got a click of people to start conspiring against me and now because I was in scholarship and she was a school B and the sister to the own of the the new own of the school she took a wrong information to director and the director came looking for me this was a honorable man Minister and he he came with the army they were looking for me and they didn't know so around 7 p.m. so as I was in class they sent they sent for me so when I reached the man wanted to slap me then he looked at me and then the the soldier said first first leave him so now they interrogated me and they found I had no problem so now they called the and they asked them but he said this man wants to burn the school that's the information they gave simply killed my influence they by killing my influence they would kill the influence of the word of God in the school because the director was a Muslim so now they started surpressing our fellowship now it came to pass that when they failed she now went through the books and now she said this man has not been paying school fees I will make sure that he pays all the school fees that he for the whole year and it was second time so she now sends a sheet me around 780 it was mock time so in mock she came and says go home and bring the money so I went home and there was no money so I stayed home so as I was at home I heard that the Lev students were demonstrating Lev students they were demonstrating they refused to go to class they refused to go to class used to eat food why because they had sent me out of school and now I was wondering my being at home how is it concerning them but we didn't know that the life of God that was in Us Praise the Lord the character of Christ had an influence in the school and now when I was there the teacher sent they called my parents and I went back to school I reached school at around 7 p.m. I found soldiers again they had put soldiers at the gate and when they saw me these other Gat men told the soldiers he the one they said you not going anywhere so I went and I slept at the Neighbors in the school the following morning as I was going in they stopped me I went back home that afternoon the school demonstrated and now when demonstrated the information reached the the minister you see what we were telling you the head boy wants to burn the school again when they now they they called me to come in interrogate me and as the whole school was seated in the the cang was where students normally gather then they we saw a vehicle like around four vehicles coming in with the police kind of escort they rushed and stopped then I knew it was all about me because it had happened before so now they called me again and they start interrogating and say people are demonstrating you are leading demonstration true youo and they said if I want bur the school truth shall come out and they sent me out of the school and I went back home then third time I was not in school I came back the day of briefing they never gave me the ID now at night they had sent me out again the girls that we are put together the school throughout the time I was there they sent for me one of them was a Pentecostal and then they said we have made consultation and we find that you are not having any problem but the issue is with your faith it seems What You Preach upsets the big woman and so she has conspired to make sure that you don't preach in this school it has nothing to do with your school Fe nothing do with with demonstration so they called me in at around 1 a.m. I got a neighbor where I was sleeping so they made me enter I said go and sit in that room and read it was a Sunday night and the following day there was a paper so when the Learners knew that I was around they all came to help discuss for them as we were discussing power went off when went off the man who was put in the school watch over the school as a manager was a drunkard so he came around and said I have smelled the of Wilson here here and you are hiding come out I have something to tell you I'm not going to suspend you to chase you out I was hiding then I came out of Darkness he says I want to tell you young man they have told us all sorts of things they have told us they have bed the mind of the director but we now know what the reason is you have a star around you and that star is always burning around you and each time I am sleeping I am restless because of you they said you're not going to sit for exams but I'm telling you as the manager of the school tomorrow morning I am going to give you your ID and you must go into the papers you have a star around you and I want know where you got that stuff and we were all speechless the man was drunk but he was speak so the following morning people go to the parate they enter the exam the B refuses to give me the after one hour the man comes and finds me out I said you must sit he went the office pick the he gave me but the first time you never allowed me in allowed me in and I have a testimony that in one hour God allowed me to get a B in that paper and now after struggling and struggling at the end of the day the woman came and she confessed and says I am sorry but because of what he used to preach is what upset me and I didn't want you to be the school you the spirit of a cult a cult and I I told her I told her I Don't Preach anything else but I preach the word of God and I assure you that this testimony of the words shall continue whether am there or I am not there and I thank God that the script of that year all of them believed all of them most of them were Kenyans but all of them believed and all of them are fellowshipping in church and I didn't pray for her to suffer but that very was and I found her selling so when I found her selling in I lowered down my my glasses and I went said Madame I'm sorry but I just want to say then she made a statement and says I am sorry I persecuted you but because because of you I am suffering and I remember there was a teacher who was a believer in the he was called Mr he made a quote he quoted and says I am telling you I told people never touch the Lord's anointed and I looked at him and he said Whoever touched you when you were in school is going to pay unless they come and repent to God have to assure you most of them recognized that I wasn't against the school even the director when results came and he heard that the child who was being persecuted is again the best the school and has teacher in the district he rushed to come and he wanted to see me but that time I also never appeared and he left a message behind and said you tell him I am sorry because he raised the hand upon me he said he was also so Restless unfortunately he lost the seat he lost the seat as a member of Parliament also as a minister and it is so surprising that right now he's going through a terrible life the word of God that we have received has power the testim that we are carrying it has power and we have this testimony we have seen the Lord working the life that is on the inside of us that is a living test on the outside the devil may rise up against it but we have a promise that he that is in US is greater than he that is in the world we are more than conquerors in every situation we are more than conquerors you stand on the word of God you confess the word of God and I want to assure you friends that throughout that time from second time to third time I never attended any class but God gave me Grace and I scored very good grace any child who attended classes why because God gave us a promise praise the Lord if he's in us he shall protect us praise the Lord he shall provide for us cast all your B upon the Lord he shall sustain you he shall sustain you shall establish you throughout all situations when you confess and recogize your position you don't need to worry I wasn't worried and I am not worried because he who I have believed is more than able to help me overcome he started a good work in us he's able and very much willing and Powerful bring this work accom know your position establish yourself in the word believe the words whatever you have need of even if it takes years to come but it shall come to pass because it is a promise to them that believe may the Lord bless you amen amen we can get on our feet amen the brother
