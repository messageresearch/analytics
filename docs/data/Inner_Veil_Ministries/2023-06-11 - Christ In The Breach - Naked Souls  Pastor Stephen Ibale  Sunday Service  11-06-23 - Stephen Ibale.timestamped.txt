[12:14] [Music]
[12:25] [Music]
[12:36] thank you
[12:41] yes sir I've got the wedding garmentor
[12:48] pressure sovereign
[13:02] [Music]
[13:28] I'm not
[13:34] so I greet you in the precious name of
[13:36] our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:39] amen and I trust that all is well with
[13:42] you
[13:45] amen amen
[13:50] it's not been so easy
[13:55] but the Lord makes everything possible
[13:59] and I trust that the Lord will speak to
[14:02] us this morning
[14:05] amen there is a quote I want to give you
[14:08] as before we get into the reading of the
[14:12] scripture
[14:16] is in the mess that glorified Jesus
[14:23] he says and in here there is all Motors
[14:31] on this side
[14:33] all that side
[14:35] men are influenced by one side
[14:41] this side comes from God
[14:45] and this side comes from the devil
[14:48] now let's just take it a great
[14:51] conglomeration of Darkness
[14:57] [Music]
[15:05] and
[15:06] divisiveness of this world
[15:10] everyone in a while you'll see a little
[15:15] white spots
[15:21] amen that's a Christian
[15:24] like a light
[15:26] in the middle of a great Darkness
[15:31] it says once in a while
[15:34] you see a white spot
[15:37] and it says that is a Christian
[15:41] who lives the life of a light
[15:44] now those that are in darkness are
[15:47] influenced from beneath
[15:51] those that are lights are influenced
[15:54] from above
[15:57] now when you leave either one of these
[16:20] now why we live here on Earth
[16:26] every one of us is influenced by a
[16:29] spiritual World
[16:32] while we are here on Earth
[16:41] especially those who have heard from
[16:43] their fear facts
[16:46] the Holy Spirit speaks to them
[16:49] and they are influence from Baba
[16:53] and then those who are
[16:58] darkness in their form of life
[17:03] they are also influenced from beneath
[17:06] bonavascript occupancy so you cannot be
[17:10] here
[17:12] whether you are a saint or a sinner
[17:17] without an influence from a spiritual
[17:20] world
[17:22] so you better know where your influence
[17:26] comes from
[17:29] amen amen either from above or from
[17:34] below
[17:35] so my prayer is that I get born again
[17:40] and then I keep hearing from the
[17:44] spiritual every single day of my life
[17:48] one day at a time to overcome the
[17:52] weaknesses of the flesh
[17:54] amen amen so uh let's stand up then and
[17:59] get in the scripture reading
[18:09] here we are continuing
[18:12] with uh
[18:15] our Bridge studies
[18:18] we saw
[18:21] the life before the bridge last time
[18:27] before the bridge
[18:29] amen that was looking at the conduct and
[18:34] character of Lord this year
[18:38] so uh we stopped at a spot
[18:42] when I promised to speak about the
[18:46] nakedness in Lord this year is
[18:52] a naked age
[18:56] and once you almost want to go naked
[19:06] honestly they are having an influence is
[19:19] so we pray that the Lord may be gracious
[19:23] that we may not reflect Lord this year
[19:29] but that we may reflect the Bride of
[19:33] Jesus Christ
[19:35] who is fully adorned in the world
[19:39] so we shall go to the Book of Revelation
[19:43] chapter 3 verse 17.
[19:47] amen amen
[19:53] foreign
[20:02] [Music]
[20:40] are you awaited
[20:43] this year
[20:45] had one Assumption of herself
[20:50] but the reality was to the contrary
[20:56] church
[20:59] so today
[21:01] we want to look at what nakedness
[21:05] foreign
[21:20] [Music]
[21:59] Souls
[22:03] naked Souls
[22:07] our souls need to be dressed
[22:13] this year they did not understand the
[22:16] dream it was dealing with
[22:19] with the Lord
[22:25] the master was talking to the spirit man
[22:29] and Lord this year was giving a natural
[22:32] confidence of herself
[22:37] a natural testimony
[22:41] so they were not flowing on the
[22:43] submarines
[22:46] so while they thought they were dressed
[22:50] because they will come to church
[22:53] and their thinking
[22:55] the master was looking at another form
[22:58] of dresses
[23:02] so they were naked
[23:07] amen so today
[23:11] we are
[23:13] continuing with Christ in the bridge
[23:23] that's where we are working from
[23:26] now he said that they need a trap a
[23:32] white trained man because
[23:38] is the fruit of the spirit
[23:43] the character that the word produces
[23:47] but the absence of that character
[23:52] is what the holy spirit is calling the
[23:57] shame of thy nakedness
[24:04] was not only naked of white training
[24:09] but they were not conscious of their
[24:12] nakedness
[24:24] amen praise the Lord amen
[24:28] so this white trainment
[24:32] is literally the dress
[24:38] the scripture says see that overcomes
[24:42] the same shall be closed with right
[24:45] right
[24:48] when you go through the scriptures
[24:52] you find the 24 Elders were seen in
[24:55] white trainers
[24:59] seated around the throne in Revelations
[25:08] is the dressing that Christ prefers for
[25:12] his brother
[25:14] but in Revelation 19.
[25:18] we see that the white Reign men
[25:21] granted by Grace
[25:26] amen is granted
[25:48] and why
[25:50] for the frightening is the righteousness
[25:54] of the Saints
[26:00] so we are granted
[26:04] because our righteousness is his
[26:08] righteousness
[26:10] that is made manifest by the fruit that
[26:14] we Bear yes
[26:19] Abraham's righteousness
[26:22] was imputed by faith in the world
[26:28] because faith
[26:32] [Music]
[27:28] it comes forth with a causative
[27:32] anointing
[27:38] through the seven churches
[27:41] the church was the hiding of power for
[27:44] the love
[27:47] amen amen it was seven homes to the land
[27:54] and in Revelation 19.
[27:57] they are called the armies which were in
[28:01] heaven
[28:03] amen that is the Church of Jesus Christ
[28:06] and these were dressed in the character
[28:10] of the world
[28:12] in Revelation 1914.
[28:16] the scripture says and the armies which
[28:20] are in heaven
[28:23] followed him upon white horses
[28:37] so we want to go through the uh concept
[28:42] of the government
[28:46] because Lord this year
[28:49] could not be any of those
[28:54] who are called the armies of the Lord
[28:58] because they were naked Souls
[29:02] they were not dressed in the garments of
[29:05] the reviewed words
[29:08] because that's the only way they could
[29:11] be the hiding of power
[29:16] because the lamb had them seven ohms
[29:22] and Horn is the power of the Beast of an
[29:27] animal against
[29:39] [Music]
[29:48] he says for we know
[29:52] that if our Catholic House of this stuff
[29:56] that were dissolved
[30:02] now Paul is talking about this house
[30:07] he says if it is
[30:11] we have a building of God
[30:15] a house not made with hands
[30:20] Eternal in the heavens
[30:21] now let me show you how you describe
[30:24] yourself
[30:27] you say oh I have hurt my foot
[30:31] is that right
[30:34] you can say this my body
[30:40] now that means
[30:43] there is somebody who possesses that
[30:47] body
[30:49] there is somebody who has hurt his food
[30:54] and that's somebody who lives in this
[30:58] body
[31:00] and therefore Paul calls him this body
[31:04] here a house
[31:08] to that somebody who draws on thyself
[31:13] but once this body falls dead
[31:18] then that house has been told yeah
[31:26] so I want you to see Paul describing you
[31:32] and the real you is the man who lives in
[31:36] that body
[31:39] that's why you have this body to
[31:42] yourself as a house
[31:48] so he says when these bodies are told
[31:52] we have another house
[31:57] but it's not
[32:44] it's now again give us another reference
[32:48] as you know the spiritual bodies being
[32:53] aprils
[33:13] that's the one which covers our
[33:17] nakedness
[33:21] didn't have the word
[33:24] it was referred to as naked
[33:30] if you don't stand in the world
[33:34] the scripture refers your soul as a
[33:38] naked song
[33:44] If so be that being closed we shall not
[33:50] be found in naked impossible
[33:56] so it's the faith in this message
[34:01] that creates the Garment for the soul
[34:06] that the
[34:08] garments
[34:11] it is
[34:23] so
[34:31] let's now fall back to Adam in the
[34:34] creation
[34:36] in Genesis
[34:40] the Bible says and God said
[34:45] let us make man in our image
[34:53] and let them have dominion over the fish
[35:28] [Music]
[35:54] which makes you a living
[36:01] [Applause]
[36:19] [Music]
[36:27] these are the chronological patterns as
[36:31] things followed
[36:36] amen he says these are the generations
[36:39] of the heavens
[36:41] and of the earth
[36:44] when they were created without wondering
[36:47] in the day that the Lord God made the
[36:51] earth and the heavens
[36:54] and every plant of valency
[37:23] I want you to understand now going up to
[37:26] it again Genesis 1.
[37:28] Adam has been created
[37:32] but Genesis 2. the scripture says there
[37:36] was not a man to kill the ground
[37:41] so you cannot tell the ground
[37:44] as a spirit
[37:47] the only way you can till the ground
[37:50] is if you have been given a body to
[37:53] leave
[37:57] are you together with me so notice
[38:00] Genesis
[38:03] as opposed to Genesis
[38:10] Genesis
[38:12] speaks about the creation of the
[38:14] spiritual man
[38:23] who wanted the man to till the ground
[38:31] and mad for him
[38:36] he's calling that body a house
[38:42] so God made the house
[38:46] for the spirit
[38:49] of this house here is the one that can
[38:53] tell you the ground
[38:57] seven and the Lord God from the man of
[39:02] the Dust of the
[39:07] grounds the breath of life
[39:11] and man become a living Soul um
[39:19] are you together with me now in Genesis
[39:24] it was a creation
[39:27] in Genesis
[39:29] it was forming and Magic
[39:34] amen amen so now let's look at what
[39:39] brother Branham says here
[39:41] now in the beginning when God made Man
[39:45] In His Image
[39:50] the first man Adam
[39:53] was a man like a god yes
[39:57] he was a spiritual man
[40:00] then we later on we find after he had
[40:04] met Man In His Image
[40:09] there was no man to kill the soul
[40:13] so he put man in frame senses
[40:18] to contact his athletes
[40:23] and then he says that's where a man fell
[40:26] away
[40:40] a body of five senses
[40:46] so the body here is your enemy
[40:54] it's your enemy normal level
[40:58] that's where you fell from
[41:01] so the Divine spirit that Adam was in
[41:06] Genesis 1.
[41:09] was dressed in a natural body
[41:14] but that natural body
[41:18] cannot live
[41:20] without a human spirit
[41:29] without
[41:43] a natural spirits
[41:57] of the word of the Lord for Israel
[42:02] says the Lord
[42:05] which stretches forth the heavens
[42:11] the foundation of the Earth
[42:16] the spirit of man within him
[42:24] are you together with me what is it so
[42:27] now
[42:30] he forms man
[42:32] but then he forms also the spirit of Man
[42:37] Too
[42:41] this is what he says in the message now
[42:44] is it not you know
[42:47] he's talking about the body now
[42:50] he says inside of that is the spirit
[42:57] which you become when you are born in
[43:00] the earth
[43:03] and the Breath of Life
[43:06] is breathed into it
[43:10] that spirit is of the worldly nature
[43:14] because it's not given from God
[43:19] but it was permitted by God
[43:25] so we are taking
[43:28] this teaching here in a slopes
[43:33] so that we can understand the kind of
[43:38] nakedness that Lord is
[43:44] so going by the career chapter 12 verse
[43:48] 1.
[43:50] it describes that when God finished
[43:53] forming the heavens and the Earth
[43:57] he formed man in the dust of the earth
[44:02] and also formed the spirit of man
[44:07] now let me tell you that was the only
[44:12] way Eve could fall
[44:16] because of the human spirit
[44:19] is just a natural Spirit
[44:23] there is nothing good about that
[44:38] the flesh came with this human spirit
[44:43] and this Natural Spirit is a free moral
[44:47] ages
[44:49] [Applause]
[45:07] because there was a part of him
[45:11] that was in the original image of God
[45:22] that was the difference
[45:24] and that's why Adam could not fall so
[45:27] far
[45:35] he says and Adam was not received
[45:41] but the woman being deceived he was
[45:44] interested
[45:47] so there is a difference here
[45:50] between Adam and Eve
[45:53] that's the difference that is making the
[45:56] subject today
[46:02] was a byproductive
[46:05] amen of the body of others Adam
[46:10] amen Amina you know
[46:15] did not come direct from God
[46:24] from the body of Adam
[46:27] amen and that's why she failed
[46:42] in order to redeem his wife
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] the same with Christ
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:57] amen amen what Adam did was the
[47:00] Redemption
[47:02] he could not fall in the original Spirit
[47:07] which was the nature of God
[47:11] amen amen so he could not fall yes
[47:20] amen amen but then when the woman fell
[47:24] and he went in
[47:27] then that's when he lost the glory of
[47:30] God
[48:05] [Music]
[48:12] to redeem his wife
[48:15] the church
[48:19] okay so before the fall because
[48:30] which body was Natural Body Soul and
[48:36] Spirit welcome back
[48:41] he was a more glorified nature of beings
[49:02] and she needed the protection of others
[49:06] to stay perfect
[49:10] okay
[49:11] are you together with me one is just
[49:14] like we are Body Soul and spirits
[49:20] and we need the constant protection of
[49:24] the holy spirit
[49:26] [Applause]
[49:28] for us to stay perfect
[49:35] therefore all Humanity
[49:40] to be under the same uniform
[49:45] which is born Body Soul and Spirits
[49:51] a bride that needs the second Adam um
[49:58] to maintain our perfection
[50:05] foreign
[50:31] but the more white
[50:34] you believe
[50:35] and exercise is
[50:40] the more your body your Symphony gets
[50:44] manifest
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:47] so each time you are studying the books
[50:51] you are listening to the text at the
[50:54] same time you are meditating on the
[50:56] world
[50:57] you're coming to church
[50:59] you are cementing your body together
[51:04] amen you cannot be referred to as naked
[51:09] because the Lord this year
[51:17] but we are not rejecting the words
[51:30] I believe I will always say man where he
[51:33] really feel this is a joy turning part
[51:37] to My of your friends
[51:44] and don't be you know our amen should be
[51:47] a healthy one I mean
[51:51] amen amen I'm hungry person
[51:55] can speak like a dying person
[52:00] that somebody was fed on the world
[52:03] and it's full enough
[52:11] so Christo had to go into the culture of
[52:16] sin and death
[52:21] and this death and Resurrection
[52:24] won the victory over death
[52:28] and the sin nurturing amen amen and now
[52:33] in the new body
[52:35] gambo
[52:37] [Music]
[52:59] [Applause]
[53:03] [Music]
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:52] [Applause]
[54:02] foreign for weed that in this Tabernacle
[54:05] a command foreign
[55:44] [Music]
[56:02] foreign now around the soul we get
[56:06] another ring we can call the spirit with
[56:09] your quest
[56:10] [Music]
[56:14] bend the outermost is the body
[56:17] temperature
[56:23] so when he blesses the senses in the
[56:26] middle Rings
[56:29] he seems to be blessing them to the soul
[56:34] but actually after his correction I will
[56:37] find more work long Assam we find out
[56:40] that actually that's what the spirit is
[56:42] supposed to be because
[56:49] there is the spirit of man
[56:52] which makes the body alive
[56:56] amen Amina and there's the spirit of God
[57:00] amen amen those are two different things
[57:03] I think you understand
[57:06] so the prophet says
[57:10] now in here there is one two three four
[57:15] five
[57:22] five attributes to the soul
[57:27] but actually later he makes us know he
[57:31] met the spirit
[57:35] now you want to write them down
[57:38] the first one is Imagination
[57:41] the second is consciousness
[57:45] and the third one is memory
[57:47] and the fourth is
[57:50] the fifth one is
[57:55] so he comes later to clarify and he says
[58:01] no outside this man is the flesh
[58:07] that's what we look at
[58:09] what we see and it has five senses to
[58:14] that body
[58:17] amen Amina then he calls them body I
[58:22] mean
[58:27] without that you can't touch the body
[58:31] that's the only way you have to the body

[58:43] would you better know your movie
[58:45] he always wants to see
[58:48] he wants to touch
[58:51] five senses
[58:54] and there's five senses
[58:56] they are enemies of faith
[59:02] that's where the enemity of faith is
[59:07] because we pray for you
[59:10] but you are still feeling
[59:13] and now you start saying I'm not here
[59:16] and yet what you still have is just the
[59:21] effects native one of what the disease

[59:46] now inside of that is the spirit yeah
[59:51] which you become when you are born in
[59:53] the earth
[59:55] and the Breath of Life is
[1:00:00] that spirit is a worldly nature
[1:00:03] because it was permitted by God
[1:00:08] there is five senses
[1:00:18] so life of God
[1:00:21] does not stay in the flesh
[1:00:26] amen Amina are you together with it what
[1:00:29] is it and the life of the spirit
[1:00:33] does not step in your human Spirit

[1:05:28] if the dressing is not changing
[1:05:32] then your soul is the naked
[1:05:36] because what is on the inside
[1:05:39] outside is going to reflect
[1:05:42] if God is on the inside there are
[1:05:45] certain things that will begin to
[1:05:47] refresh
[1:05:51] now let me tell you something
[1:05:55] first the challenge in the garden
[1:05:59] from the middle room
[1:06:02] which has five senses

[1:06:25] contemplating at every statement
[1:06:29] that's where there is Imagination
[1:06:32] where is the conscience
[1:06:34] then reason
[1:06:38] foreign
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:57] [Applause]
[1:07:18] if I become

[1:07:32] words of sun
[1:07:34] imagination begins
[1:07:36] you say well we shall talk about it
[1:07:40] you get home it has settled in the
[1:07:43] memory
[1:07:45] you begin reasoning the pros and the
[1:07:47] cones
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:28] very far
[1:08:31] foreign
[1:09:22] that I have chewed this up here
[1:09:26] and that's why I'm The Sinner today
[1:09:29] Jesus says that could not be possible
[1:09:32] yes
[1:09:33] because it enters not into the heart
[1:09:37] but on to a belly and goeth into the
[1:09:42] drought packing or mix that I'm like
[1:09:44] yeah
[1:09:48] um
[1:09:53] that which comes out of the man that
[1:09:58] defiles the man is
[1:10:02] saying that that which
[1:10:05] proceeds from the spirits
[1:10:09] from the human spirit
[1:10:12] and settles itself into the soul
[1:10:17] is what the files
[1:10:22] foreign
[1:10:44] foreign
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:08] the evil nature
[1:12:11] to see them from within the serpentine
[1:12:14] is what is
[1:12:18] and eventually committed
[1:12:24] listen to First John chapter 2 verse 16.
[1:12:30] he says for all Baptists in the world
[1:12:35] not some of waters in the world
[1:12:39] but all that is in the world
[1:12:44] the last of the flesh
[1:12:47] the last of the eyes
[1:12:49] of pride of life
[1:12:52] oh that is
[1:12:55] last fight under those three things
[1:12:58] the last of the flesh the last of the
[1:13:02] eyes the pride of life that is not of
[1:13:06] the father
[1:13:07] oh that is of the world
[1:13:12] you start looking at this theme
[1:13:16] and then you go to the arapa profession
[1:13:19] and you know those things kind of get on
[1:13:22] the east side and we start seeing a
[1:13:25] sister doing cat works
[1:13:35] cut work
[1:13:37] Tumblr they are so smart
[1:13:40] they design a skirts
[1:13:43] that will not allow your legs to part
[1:13:46] when you walk it is
[1:14:01] all that is in the world
[1:14:06] the last of the flesh
[1:14:09] the pride of life
[1:14:11] and the pride I'm in the the the the the
[1:14:14] the the the uh less of the eyes
[1:14:18] is not of God Amen I mean the last of
[1:14:22] the flesh the last of the eyes and the
[1:14:26] pride of life are all activities of the
[1:14:30] human spirit
[1:14:33] and that's what the serpent used against
[1:14:36] even the garden
[1:14:39] but you can shut all that out yeah
[1:14:47] amen Amina so we close the channel
[1:14:53] by feeding on the world
[1:14:56] now Satan again
[1:14:59] uses those three against Christ on the
[1:15:02] mountains
[1:15:05] but Jesus victory
[1:15:09] was sealing the channel by the word
[1:15:14] amen that's how you close the chain of
[1:15:17] your human Spirit
[1:15:20] by saying it is
[1:15:30] Jesus is tempted by the devil yes
[1:15:33] he overcame the personal Temptations
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:16:46] which was the last foreign
[1:17:25] so the human spirit is the nature that
[1:17:29] must die nobody knows in order for it to
[1:17:32] come under the influence of the Holy
[1:17:34] ghosts
[1:17:37] amen Amina so the prophet says we know
[1:17:41] what the spirit is
[1:17:43] it controls the flesh
[1:17:48] praise the Lord he says we know what the
[1:17:53] spirit is
[1:17:57] and we know pretty
[1:18:01] what the spirit is it controls the flesh
[1:18:08] let's go to Romans chapter six
[1:18:15] I enjoying the world
[1:18:17] amen amen Romans 6 16
[1:18:40] weather of sin unto death
[1:18:45] or obedience
[1:18:55] that one becomes your master
[1:18:58] if you yield yourself to sin
[1:19:02] at the same is unbelief
[1:19:12] then you become a servant man your focus
[1:19:15] of sin after this
[1:19:18] so Eve jump to the fortification
[1:19:30] like Lord this is
[1:19:36] the absence of the world
[1:19:39] is the nakedness of the church
[1:19:44] so when Eve jumped over the
[1:19:47] fortification of the world
[1:19:50] she was as naked yeah
[1:19:56] and she cannot be able to overcome the
[1:19:59] devil that way
[1:20:02] so Lord this is
[1:20:26] the kingdom of God
[1:20:29] the Bible says she was wretched
[1:20:33] meaning that she was enduring toys and
[1:20:37] troubles
[1:20:40] simply because the Comfort had worked
[1:20:43] out
[1:20:44] foreign
[1:21:14] foreign
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:22:06] but when the devil came I started he was
[1:22:09] an alternative child
[1:22:11] and I never told them if you eat of the
[1:22:15] fruits
[1:22:21] that's where the problem came
[1:22:24] there was an alternative challenge
[1:22:27] knowing good and evil before that
[1:22:31] methods
[1:22:34] now she had tested
[1:22:37] and now she had no power but yeah
[1:22:44] huh
[1:22:45] are you together
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:22:58] I don't know today we've been given the
[1:23:01] child of good brilliant we've been given
[1:23:04] the child of God
[1:23:08] but I don't know why you want to open up
[1:23:11] all this other channels
[1:23:13] you read this literature you read that
[1:23:17] literature
[1:23:23] religion Catholics
[1:23:39] amen I mean that was the problem of ease
[1:23:43] human spirit
[1:23:46] ambitious
[1:23:51] amen I mean let's go to Romans chapter
[1:23:53] 7.
[1:23:55] understand the channel
[1:23:57] that he failed to control
[1:24:03] Romans 7 8 says
[1:24:07] but sin taking occasion by the
[1:24:11] Commandment wrote in me all manner of
[1:24:14] Consciousness
[1:24:24] so when
[1:24:27] it opens up channels of lust for this
[1:24:32] channel
[1:24:36] so this is what Paul says
[1:24:49] different cravings
[1:24:52] and longing for everything that's
[1:24:55] forbidden
[1:24:58] so after the fall the son of evil became
[1:25:03] stronger foreign
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:26:03] Africa
[1:27:12] the condition of the Soul
[1:27:16] you put on this video
[1:27:19] up to you
[1:27:21] a Christian
[1:27:23] will reveal her body
[1:27:30] but each time your desire is to unveil
[1:27:34] your flesh is
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:58] it positively becomes the nature of the
[1:28:01] spirit
[1:28:04] because the nature of the spirit
[1:28:09] defines the kind of soul that you are
[1:28:12] when by knowledge
[1:28:14] amen amen when in the wilderness
[1:28:19] Iran cause the people to jump the
[1:28:21] fortifications
[1:28:26] that the people were naked
[1:28:29] for everyone
[1:28:33] amongst their enemies
[1:28:41] cannot have the confidence
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:06] he stays away from the government
[1:29:11] amen Amina so any true child of God
[1:29:17] is soul that is
[1:29:22] to be part of fellas
[1:29:26] God gave us Grace
[1:29:29] let us look at the king calling a party
[1:29:35] amen amen and look at this naked guests
[1:29:42] he had the desire to be part of the
[1:29:44] party
[1:29:47] Matthew chapter 22.
[1:29:53] then says it to his servants
[1:29:56] the wedding is ready
[1:29:59] but today which were beaten were not
[1:30:02] worthy
[1:30:05] just look at the calling of Lord this
[1:30:08] year to the marriage of the Lamb
[1:30:14] he says those who are bidened to come
[1:30:21] on to the highways and as many
[1:30:26] as you shall find bid to the marriage
[1:30:35] so those servants went out into the
[1:30:38] highways
[1:30:40] and together together all as many as
[1:30:44] they found
[1:30:46] both good and bad
[1:30:49] and the wedding was finished with guests
[1:30:53] and when the king came in
[1:30:56] to see the guests
[1:31:00] when the king came in to see the guests
[1:31:07] had not a garmentor
[1:31:12] he was naked at the wedding
[1:31:17] he had no wedding garments
[1:31:24] are you together with him so we are
[1:31:27] beaten to come to the wedding
[1:31:30] but then we need to prepare
[1:31:34] that's why we come here
[1:31:36] to sow our wedding garments
[1:31:41] because out there the king came to see
[1:31:45] the guests
[1:31:46] and found a man
[1:31:49] who had no wedding gown
[1:31:53] and he says that to him friend how come
[1:31:58] is
[1:31:59] not having a wedding garment
[1:32:03] and they were speechless
[1:32:07] you know the Lord
[1:32:10] hard Cuts towards him
[1:32:20] and he says
[1:32:24] praise the Lord so the Lord does not use
[1:32:28] rough speech
[1:32:31] in expressing his displeasure towards
[1:32:34] somebody
[1:32:35] who
[1:32:37] fails to use the garments of the world
[1:32:42] that's the way the Lord Works

[1:33:20] children and call them all kinds of
[1:33:22] names
