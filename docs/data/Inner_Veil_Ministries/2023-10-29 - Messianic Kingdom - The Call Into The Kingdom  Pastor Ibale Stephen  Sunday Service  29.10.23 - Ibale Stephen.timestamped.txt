[19:07] soing will you continue with the
[19:10] journey amen because in this
[19:14] calling God calls you as an
[19:17] individual amen just uh in the week
[19:23] I you
[19:24] know two weeks now
[19:28] I had a
[19:31] situation that when I would go to
[19:34] bed I would get problem on my
[19:40] left like there is a stone on the inside
[19:45] here a
[19:47] stor you wouldn't turn on the bed the
[19:51] way you
[19:56] want so I had go and visit a
[20:03] cardiologist amen so they took all the
[20:06] ECG and whatever they
[20:10] do and they told me you don't have
[20:12] enough blood running to your
[20:16] heart so I need your
[20:19] prayers amen and sister Gloria
[20:24] today is in trying to have a baby
[20:29] so we also remember her in our
[20:33] prayers amen amen so I rarely
[20:38] dream and
[20:40] remember when I dream I just know there
[20:43] was a dream but I could figure it
[20:48] out but you know on Saturday
[20:54] 27th I mean that was
[20:57] Friday
[20:58] was it
[21:00] yesterday yeah
[21:02] Friday I got a
[21:04] dream uh and it was at a very old
[21:14] hour I normally wake up in very early in
[21:17] the
[21:18] morning sometimes at 3
[21:22] 4 to do my
[21:25] study and then uh at
[21:29] around six
[21:31] something I normally catch another
[21:35] hour so uh it was at 7:40 in the
[21:42] morning I
[21:44] dreamed in this
[21:47] dream I was in a
[21:50] convention in the area
[21:53] of and so we were staying in a
[21:56] house with which was close to the
[22:00] meetings and a few of us were leaving I
[22:03] mean were seated in the uh you know
[22:07] living
[22:09] room and suddenly appeared brother
[22:15] godf very smartly
[22:18] dressed is the one responsible for
[22:21] Designing the background of our
[22:26] church a few of us you know when we
[22:30] looked at
[22:32] him he greeted us and he disappeared
[22:36] into a
[22:38] bedroom and nobody seemed to follow
[22:42] him later he appeared standing behind my
[22:47] my
[22:50] seat and laying his right hand on my
[22:53] left
[22:55] shoulder then I told the people
[22:59] people that brother passed
[23:04] on and I preached his
[23:08] funeral and because we were two of us
[23:11] that took the
[23:14] services it was so
[23:17] real I then intended to call another
[23:22] brother brother Freeman whom some of you
[23:25] know very
[23:26] well
[23:28] that come and greet brother
[23:31] Godfrey but I mentioned the wrong
[23:35] name and I called brother
[23:38] hington but then later I corrected and
[23:42] says come and greet brother
[23:46] godri and they shook hands with
[23:49] him I remember very well in the
[23:52] dream I started telling the people that
[23:56] brother Bram said
[23:58] that our loved ones will appear Among Us
[24:03] first and then we shall be
[24:06] CH amen immediately I said
[24:10] that again he had
[24:13] disappeared then I woke up so you know
[24:17] sometimes we look at the times that we
[24:20] are living
[24:22] here amen time is no
[24:26] longer and then if there is any form of
[24:29] seriousness we
[24:31] need it should be
[24:34] now because when you look at everything
[24:37] happening in the Middle
[24:41] East amen there is already a very big
[24:47] problem all the nations are rising
[24:50] against
[24:52] Israel and it's
[24:54] prophesied that it would happen like
[24:57] that
[24:58] so you know you just don't understand
[25:01] what season we are living
[25:04] in so the most important
[25:07] thing is to be
[25:09] ready one of these days all our loved
[25:14] ones they appear in service
[25:17] here amen and then you'll say oh that's
[25:20] brother so and
[25:22] so sister so and
[25:24] so and so our
[25:26] mind so much J into the coming of the
[25:32] Lord and so for that we should be ready
[25:37] read amen let's stand up and get into
[25:39] the scripture
[25:42] reading we turn to the Book of
[25:46] Revelations chapter
[25:49] 18 and we are still dealing with the
[25:52] Messianic
[25:54] Kingdom amen and this morning I want to
[25:57] speak speak on a call into the
[26:03] kingdom where are we called
[26:05] from and so that's what I want to deal
[26:08] with this
[26:10] morning let us pray PR father we thank
[26:15] you so much because you are here
[26:18] together with
[26:19] us father we are going into the most Sac
[26:25] moment of the service the teaching of
[26:28] the word you said in your word that
[26:33] blessed are those who hear and blessed
[26:38] are those who read I pray that you may
[26:41] bless your
[26:42] people in this moment some of them have
[26:45] got
[26:47] needs father I pray that you may meet
[26:50] them and above all father Help the
[26:53] People Help us together that we may
[26:58] have an entr into this
[27:01] Kingdom in Jesus name
[27:05] amen so um the title is Messianic
[27:13] Kingdom the call into the
[27:19] Kingdom so in verse one of Revelation
[27:26] 18 after these things I saw another
[27:31] Angel come down from
[27:36] heaven having great power and the Earth
[27:40] was lighted with his
[27:45] glory and he cried with a
[27:49] mighty with a mighty I mean he cried
[27:53] mightily with a strong
[27:56] voice
[27:59] saying babon the great is
[28:03] Fallen is fallen and is become the
[28:07] habitation of
[28:10] devils and the hold of every F
[28:15] Spirit and the cage of every unan and
[28:22] hateful for all nations have drunk of
[28:25] the
[28:26] wine
[28:28] the
[28:36] of and the kings of the Earth have
[28:39] committed fornication with
[28:43] her and the merchants of the Earth are
[28:46] Works reach through the delic I mean the
[28:49] abundance of our
[28:52] [Music]
[28:53] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[28:56] from heaven
[28:59] saying come out of her my
[29:03] people be not partakers
[29:07] of and that you receive not of
[29:10] [Music]
[29:12] her come out over my
[29:15] people a
[29:17] call into the
[29:19] kingdom may God bless of
[29:24] the so in this morning we pray that the
[29:28] Lord May really give us
[29:32] Grace you see Israel was called from a
[29:37] natural
[29:39] Kingdom which is
[29:41] Egypt to make a natural
[29:45] Kingdom in Exodus I mean in in Canaan
[29:49] and that was a natural
[29:53] Exodus but we are called from what the
[29:56] scripture calls
[29:59] the
[30:00] kingdoms of
[30:03] Darkness to the spiritual Kingdom of
[30:07] Light meaning that the new
[30:10] birth is a spiritual
[30:14] exod amen there is somewhere we come
[30:18] from we come from a spiritual
[30:22] babon which is a mix of all different
[30:25] forms of cultures and traditions
[30:30] and this
[30:31] mixture is what we call mystery Babylon
[30:35] the
[30:39] great mother ofs and all Abominations of
[30:42] the
[30:44] earth so it's in Babylon the kingdom the
[30:47] ancient
[30:50] Kingdom where all the elements of the
[30:53] Fall were given
[30:56] prominence
[31:00] amen so I want us to just have a brief
[31:08] trail of how sin
[31:11] come you know we look at uh you know
[31:15] from the garden we see the
[31:18] serpent he
[31:23] beg and then we also see that the same
[31:26] spirit
[31:28] moves into C into the slot of
[31:34] Abel and then after that we see H in the
[31:40] ark and then you see we Trail and come
[31:43] to
[31:45] Kush and then after Kush we look at
[31:50] Nim in the tower of
[31:54] babyon so to Babylon which was polishing
[31:57] of all evil before it
[32:03] again so it's the
[32:06] serpent it's Abel
[32:10] it's because the sin crossed
[32:13] over then
[32:15] it's then in the Tower of
[32:19] Babel and then finally we see the real
[32:22] Kingdom of
[32:24] babyon so now Babel
[32:28] is the original name of
[32:31] Babylon it means
[32:34] confusion so in today's
[32:37] study we are going to go into quite a
[32:40] number of
[32:41] scriptures to help us
[32:44] understand what we are called out
[32:47] of because many times we think that we
[32:51] came out of one Church into another
[32:56] church no sir to come out of
[32:59] Babylon mystery
[33:02] Babylon is to come out of the
[33:06] confusion that originates from
[33:10] Babylon amen are you together with me so
[33:14] it's possible while you sit in this
[33:17] assembly that you are still in
[33:21] babyon because the elements of
[33:24] Babylon sometimes have never died out of
[33:26] our
[33:29] amen so as I said
[33:32] Babel is the original name of
[33:35] babyon it means
[33:38] confusion it was literally started by
[33:42] Kush the son of H but was brought to a
[33:46] kingdom of power and
[33:51] Grand under his son
[33:55] Nim which the Bible calls Nimrod the
[33:58] mighty
[34:01] hunter in Genesis
[34:04] 11 so Babylon is a
[34:08] mix of three major Global
[34:15] operations is encompassed in three
[34:19] elements amen praise the Lord political
[34:24] power amen religious
[34:27] power and then
[34:30] Commerce three things which govern the
[34:34] Earth political power religious power
[34:39] and then
[34:40] Comm sometimes when you understand the
[34:44] history behind what God requires of
[34:49] you then it will be possible for you to
[34:53] do the right
[34:55] thing are you together with
[34:57] come out
[34:59] ofon I said that's a common
[35:02] saying but what does it mean this is
[35:05] what I want to deal
[35:07] with amen so these
[35:10] three these
[35:12] three which is political power religious
[35:16] power and
[35:19] commas they make the world
[35:22] systems and
[35:24] unfortunately we cannot live without
[35:28] them but yet we can live above
[35:31] them are you together with me you cannot
[35:35] live in a
[35:36] world where there's no
[35:38] politics amen because it's just natural
[35:42] that when people come together a leader
[35:46] emerges amen like in the kingdoms of
[35:50] this
[35:51] world praise God so you cannot
[35:54] do without control
[35:58] amen I'm sure that in the beginning
[36:01] there nobody who voted
[36:05] toak but some kind of
[36:08] guy sees a number of people
[36:12] together and Imes and says I'm going to
[36:14] rule
[36:16] you and then he gets another son and
[36:20] makes sybol
[36:21] St that's how things
[36:24] start amen these are Spirit
[36:28] amen that govern the Earth and you
[36:31] cannot be
[36:33] together amen without you know
[36:37] religion it just
[36:39] emerges a certain belief comes and then
[36:43] the people begin to roll
[36:46] around and finally you cannot live
[36:49] without
[36:50] Commerce because you have to buy and
[36:54] sell amen so we are engulfed in a
[37:00] community where all these three
[37:03] control but while we live in it we have
[37:08] the ability to live
[37:10] above let's go to John chapter
[37:13] 17 and verse
[37:16] 15 verse 15 says I pray not that thou
[37:21] should take them out of the
[37:24] world Amen he says that don't pray that
[37:29] you may take them out of the
[37:31] world but that you should keep them from
[37:35] the evil that's in the
[37:39] world Amen that's the prayer when Jesus
[37:44] was
[37:44] living he saw the control upon the
[37:48] Earth and he says well we are not I'm
[37:52] not I'm praying that you don't take them
[37:55] off to come with me but I pray that as
[38:00] they live here you keep them from the
[38:03] evil that's in the
[38:05] world Amen praise the Lord and he says
[38:10] they are not of the
[38:12] world even as I am not of the
[38:16] world Amen so in your Direct
[38:20] Communications you will always rub shers
[38:23] with the
[38:25] world where you go to work you are
[38:28] rubbing shoulders with the
[38:31] world in your
[38:33] school you are rubbing shoulders with
[38:36] the
[38:37] world Amen but then God desires that you
[38:42] live beyond the
[38:46] control of the environment that
[38:48] surrounds
[38:49] you when you are together with
[38:53] thieves Amen in some kind of a
[38:57] society maybe they are my
[39:00] neighbors I should not become a
[39:03] fear if I am working with a
[39:06] drunker I shouldn't become a
[39:09] drunker because there is a prayer that
[39:12] the Lord said over
[39:14] you that while you live among those
[39:19] circumstances you cannot be overcome by
[39:22] them you will live above
[39:25] them amen
[39:27] so in first John chapter
[39:29] 2 verse
[39:31] 15 he says love not the
[39:37] world neither the things that are in the
[39:41] world if any man love the
[39:44] world the love of the
[39:47] father is not in him amen so love not
[39:53] the
[39:54] world now there's a difference
[39:57] between the Earth and the
[40:06] world there is a difference between the
[40:10] two between you know the GE
[40:14] [Music]
[40:17] out amen and also the
[40:21] systems that are in that
[40:24] Earth so one is the kingdom I mean
[40:29] one uh is the
[40:33] [Music]
[40:34] world
[40:37] H and then let me try because he's
[40:41] failing to get the difference between
[40:43] the
[40:45] two the
[40:47] Earth is your
[40:51] vegetation the
[40:54] Earth is the mountains
[40:57] the
[40:58] rivers The
[41:00] Valleys the
[41:02] plains the that's the
[41:05] Earth but then the
[41:25] world
[41:31] so this world
[41:35] here is a
[41:37] system that's brought forth by the
[41:41] people that live on the
[41:45] earth so you now understand so now the
[41:49] Bible
[41:50] says love not the
[41:55] world
[41:56] amen love not the
[42:00] world the Bible doesn't say that love
[42:04] not the
[42:06] Earth because the Earth was a creation
[42:10] of
[42:11] God but the
[42:14] world is the systems of the
[42:18] people are you together with me yeah so
[42:21] now the Bible
[42:23] says love not the world
[42:27] [Music]
[42:28] neither the things that are in the
[42:31] world if any man love the
[42:34] world the love of God is not in
[42:38] him so you understand now so let us look
[42:43] at the
[42:46] world Amen Let us look at the
[42:50] world and the systems that govern
[42:54] it which God
[42:56] says we should not
[42:59] laugh where did it begin from amen let's
[43:04] go to Revelation chapter
[43:06] 18 where we read the Bible says that
[43:12] after these
[43:14] things I saw another Angel come down
[43:18] from
[43:20] heaven having great
[43:23] power and the Earth was
[43:26] lightened with his
[43:30] glory so the Bible in I mean Revelation
[43:35] 18 it begins by saying after these
[43:41] things what things the things that are
[43:44] described in Revelation
[43:48] 17 because in Revelation
[43:51] 17 the Bible is talking about a
[43:55] beast which has got a uh let's get there
[44:00] before we can be able to understand this
[44:02] very
[44:03] well amen I was telling brother
[44:06] James that I end up preaching for quite
[44:10] some bit of
[44:11] period because I don't want to leave
[44:14] anybody
[44:16] behind now here in Revelation chapter
[44:20] 17 there is a voice that talks with
[44:25] John amen and then he says you know he
[44:30] was called To A
[44:33] wilderness to see so now verse three so
[44:38] he carried me away in the spirit in the
[44:43] wilderness and I saw a
[44:46] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored
[44:49] Beast full of names of
[44:53] blashe having seven heads and 10
[44:58] H so in Revelation chapter
[45:01] 17 amen there is a thought which is
[45:05] picked to come to
[45:08] that and now that point is in Revelation
[45:13] 13 Verse
[45:15] 18 you just leave your finger
[45:19] there because we shall be going back to
[45:23] 17 he says here is
[45:27] wisdom let him that
[45:30] understanding count the number of the
[45:33] Beast for the number of a
[45:37] man amen and this number
[45:43] 666 so when we are talking about a
[45:47] beast carrying a
[45:49] woman amen don't look at an
[45:52] animal look at a man who has set
[45:58] persisting are you together with me so
[46:01] in verse 4 of Revelation
[46:05] 17 he says and the woman was in
[46:10] purple and the scet
[46:12] color and decked with
[46:15] [Music]
[46:18] gold and precious
[46:20] stones and P having a golden cup in hand
[46:26] full of Abominations and fness of
[46:35] forication and this woman here is
[46:39] supposed to have been the
[46:46] church so we can call this
[46:49] woman a fallen
[46:52] woman a fallen Church are you together
[46:56] with me and it has got
[47:00] somebody that rides
[47:05] around and upon her
[47:07] [Music]
[47:08] forehead was
[47:11] written
[47:13] name mystery babon the
[47:18] great the mother of and Abominations of
[47:21] the
[47:23] earth amen are you together with me he
[47:27] says that mystery babyon the great
[47:35] mother praise God so she is not
[47:42] Babylon but she is a mystery
[47:48] Babylon so in this this woman the Bible
[47:53] says she Seth upon many
[47:57] Waters so these are
[48:00] symbols Revelation is the book of
[48:02] symbols in verse 15 We Now understand
[48:07] what the waters
[48:09] are verse 15
[48:11] says and he says unto me the waters
[48:16] which thou
[48:18] seest amen where the who were
[48:22] SE are peoples and
[48:26] multitudes and Nations and
[48:31] tongs okay now so now they are
[48:34] describing this woman
[48:35] here and the Beast that carries
[48:39] her and then once he comes into chapter
[48:43] 18 verse one that's why he says after
[48:47] these
[48:50] things amen I saw another Angel come
[48:54] down from heaven
[48:57] having great power and the Earth was
[48:59] lighted in his
[49:01] glory and he cried mightly with a strong
[49:05] voice
[49:06] saying
[49:08] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[49:14] and is become the
[49:16] habitation of
[49:18] devils and the H of every false
[49:22] Spirit and the C of every unclean and
[49:29] so where are we called out
[49:32] of we are called out of a church
[49:35] system that has fallen from the
[49:38] world so this
[49:41] babyon is a web that is knit around our
[49:45] social
[49:48] lives and all Natures of
[49:51] evil operates in this mystery Babylon
[49:57] under the power of politics religion and
[50:02] money so every of
[50:08] glob amen is kned around these
[50:15] factors we got business
[50:18] cels business
[50:22] cels amen we get different drug
[50:28] CS amen and they all operate under
[50:33] there but our major emphasis
[50:37] today is not on money and
[50:40] politics it's now you and
[50:45] me not to be
[50:47] CAU into that
[50:50] system that's what we are called out
[50:54] of because says for all nations have
[50:57] drunk of the wine of
[51:01] AR amen and the kings of the Earth have
[51:05] committed forication with
[51:07] her amen and the Marchers of the Earth
[51:11] are now greatly
[51:13] rich in the abundance of her
[51:18] delices and therefore I heard another
[51:20] voice from Heaven
[51:22] say come out of her my
[51:27] people Amen in the world but not of the
[51:35] world Amen Rising
[51:40] above that's why he says come out of all
[51:43] my
[51:45] people this is not going to be another
[51:50] Exodus amen like it was in
[51:53] Egypt your
[51:56] to come out is just for you not to be
[52:01] partaker of all the wrong things that
[52:05] happen in
[52:06] Babylon Amen in the Bible we've got an
[52:11] example of the children of
[52:13] Israel that were captured and taken into
[52:17] Babylon in captivity but then we've got
[52:21] three
[52:23] boys m
[52:27] and another one and sedra praise the
[52:31] Lord they were in Bon but they refus to
[52:36] worship the god of babon are you
[52:38] together with me in babyon But Rising
[52:42] above
[52:44] babyon we've got Daniel he was in
[52:47] Babylon a Fallen Kingdom which was
[52:51] wicked but Daniel raised above
[52:57] and you also you live in a mystery
[53:00] babon a fallen wild
[53:03] system but one thing which we pray for
[53:07] is that you may stand like Daniel in
[53:11] this
[53:12] babyon amen praise God listen to what
[53:17] the prophet
[53:18] say he says come out over my
[53:22] people say to the Lord come out of
[53:27] Babylon
[53:29] confusion come out of your of of your
[53:34] Creeds of your self styled
[53:37] things I will receive you says the Lord
[53:42] touch not the unclean
[53:44] things nether bnic parties in
[53:49] church and the bank and all other kind
[53:52] of
[53:54] stuffff and it
[53:56] dances he says come out so where are we
[54:00] coming from you are not coming from a
[54:04] natural
[54:05] world into another natural
[54:08] world like they came from
[54:11] egy into Canan that's not your call your
[54:16] call is to come out of the
[54:19] things that are generated in
[54:23] Babylon that those things don't have
[54:26] control over
[54:27] you the Fashions of this world will not
[54:31] appeal to
[54:32] you you find people some of them are
[54:36] going for a
[54:38] wedding and they go
[54:40] naked my little
[54:43] grandchild two years looked at a picture
[54:47] of one of the people that were a
[54:51] bright this morning and she said
[54:59] girl those are
[55:01] things that are generated in the Fallen
[55:04] system and the purpose of all these
[55:07] things is to gender
[55:15] sin
[55:18] amen praise the Lord you know verse five
[55:23] of Revelation 18 say
[55:26] upon her
[55:29] forehead was the name
[55:32] written mystery
[55:34] Babylon the mother of Hots and
[55:37] Abominations of the
[55:41] earth praise the Lord now this woman
[55:45] here that was riding on top of this
[55:49] Beast amen is called mystery
[55:54] babyon and the beest was the
[55:59] engineer behind her
[56:01] systems are you together with me you are
[56:04] going to understand
[56:06] today amen and understand where you come
[56:09] from what the gospel is calling you
[56:13] out amen so the F of our
[56:18] fornication means the
[56:21] fness of her
[56:23] unfaithfulness
[56:25] because she is supposed to have been a
[56:29] church that is married to the Lord Jesus
[56:33] Christ but that's not where her loyalty
[56:38] is you begin to show them
[56:41] scripture and prove to them that BM is
[56:45] in Jesus
[56:47] name and they refuse it you show them
[56:51] scripture that ladies should dress
[56:54] modestly
[56:56] they reject it are you together with me
[57:00] yeah it is a
[57:02] system that has got a hold of the
[57:05] people and when God is saving you that's
[57:09] the system he calls you
[57:12] out to take you into Messianic
[57:15] Kingdom where the word is our
[57:21] control amen so you know unfaithful to
[57:26] Divine
[57:28] leadership unfaithful to the
[57:30] instructions of
[57:33] Christ which is supposed to be the
[57:35] husband to the
[57:37] church so and Abomination
[57:41] therefore because she was Mother of
[57:44] harot Amen the groups that reject the
[57:50] word and they come from that
[57:53] Union every group is called
[57:58] hot amen are you together with me and
[58:03] then he says again appear that full of
[58:07] Abominations of the
[58:10] earth so when you are called out of
[58:13] babyon the main thing you are being
[58:16] called out of is the
[58:21] [Music]
[58:23] Abominations
[58:25] amen you come out of the
[58:29] Abominations if you come out of a
[58:32] religion and you Ser come to the
[58:35] message and then you walk in with the
[58:38] Abominations of the
[58:40] land you are still in Babylon while
[58:44] you're
[58:48] here so to come out of
[58:51] babyon is to totally come out of the uh
[58:55] you know traditions and uh the
[59:02] Abominations so Abomination
[59:06] means the things that are
[59:09] [Music]
[59:13] detestable
[59:16] something amen and it's only God who can
[59:21] tell us what an Abomination is
[59:27] are you together with me it's not you
[59:30] who declares what an Abomination
[59:34] is it's God who tells us what an
[59:38] Abomination
[59:39] is because he's the one who knows what
[59:43] is calling us out
[59:45] of as we come into the Messianic
[59:50] kingom amen so let us look at a few of
[59:54] these
[59:56] Abominations in
[59:58] Leviticus
[1:00:00] 18 and verse
[1:00:02] 22 I want you to write it down
[1:00:08] homosexuality is an
[1:00:12] Abomination okay because in Romans
[1:00:15] chapter one when the First Church of
[1:00:18] Rome
[1:00:20] fell the Bible says God gave them up
[1:00:25] to an unlean
[1:00:27] spirit and they started living
[1:00:30] together woman and wom and then men and
[1:00:35] men the Bible calls that an
[1:00:38] Abomination we come out of that we
[1:00:41] cannot be
[1:00:43] partaker of that kind of
[1:00:46] character amen
[1:00:49] Deuteronomy 7 verse
[1:00:53] 25 a wor ship involving
[1:00:57] Idols is an
[1:00:59] Abomination are you together with me we
[1:01:02] cannot involve
[1:01:04] ourselves in a worship where they are
[1:01:08] Idols some of these
[1:01:12] Idols you know
[1:01:14] sculptures but then there
[1:01:17] are where the men became the
[1:01:23] idol
[1:01:25] they desire to take the respect of
[1:01:29] God that's IDE I
[1:01:32] mean idol
[1:01:34] worship it's
[1:01:38] idolatry because no man can share this
[1:01:42] honor with the Lord Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ amen Deuteronomy chapter
[1:01:49] 18 verse
[1:01:51] 11 and
[1:01:53] 12 involving in
[1:01:56] Witchcraft and Consulting
[1:01:59] witches is an
[1:02:01] Abomination come out of that you are not
[1:02:04] supposed to be a
[1:02:06] partaker to astrology of any
[1:02:10] kind
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] 22 and
[1:02:16] verse a woman wearing what pertains to a
[1:02:21] man is an abomination
[1:02:27] hallelujah hallelujah mother
[1:02:31] of and all Abominations of the
[1:02:34] earth so we need to know the
[1:02:38] Abominations out of which we are
[1:02:42] called amen I know one day when I put on
[1:02:46] a
[1:02:47] dress and I start moving on the streets
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:52] Ginger either they will say I'm
[1:02:55] mad all the police will arrest
[1:02:59] me because it's not
[1:03:02] natural the Bible calls it an
[1:03:05] Abomination so when you talk to these
[1:03:08] ladies who were interested on putting on
[1:03:11] a man's
[1:03:13] cloth they said the fry of a man looks
[1:03:16] to
[1:03:18] the but the one of the woman turns to
[1:03:21] the
[1:03:23] left but still the
[1:03:26] TR in our culture is accepted as a man's
[1:03:31] well but the people have taken for it
[1:03:36] the Bible says it's an
[1:03:41] Abomination amen so let's go to Proverbs
[1:03:45] chapter
[1:03:46] 15 and verse
[1:03:48] 8 the scripture says the
[1:03:52] sacrifice of the wicked
[1:03:55] is an Abomination to the
[1:03:58] Lord but the
[1:04:00] prayer of their PR is
[1:04:05] Delight are you together with me so now
[1:04:08] this is an
[1:04:10] Abomination where many of us could be
[1:04:14] found
[1:04:16] guilty we come to the church like this
[1:04:19] one we enjoy the teaching of the
[1:04:22] word but then we car certain forms of
[1:04:27] life that qualify Us in
[1:04:32] wickedness the Bible say the sacrifice
[1:04:36] of the
[1:04:37] wicked is an Abomination to the
[1:04:40] Lord amen an offering paid in
[1:04:44] sin is an
[1:04:46] Abomination you bring your offerings you
[1:04:50] bring your
[1:04:51] ti amen and you think think God is
[1:04:55] pleased with
[1:04:56] you he says that's an
[1:04:59] Abomination let me tell you a secret
[1:05:02] that's why we pay TI and become more
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:11] poor the time is no
[1:05:14] longer we need to come out of
[1:05:17] babon and get into the Messianic
[1:05:21] Kingdom so that we can enjoy
[1:05:25] the services of
[1:05:27] Holiness in this Kingdom which is
[1:05:32] justification
[1:05:34] sanctification of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:05:36] Min of the
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:40] world hallelujah hallelujah so Matthew
[1:05:44] 5 verse
[1:05:48] 23 if you bring thy
[1:05:51] gift to the altar and there remember
[1:05:56] that thy brother has out against
[1:06:06] thee are you together with me he says
[1:06:10] leave there thy

[1:06:38] another family one sister cannot talk to
[1:06:42] another sister the Bible says if we are
[1:06:46] in that kind of condition the sacrifice
[1:06:50] of the
[1:06:51] wicked is an abomination the prayers we

[1:06:59] be in harmony with one
[1:07:01] another where two or three are gathered
[1:07:07] together in one
[1:07:10] unit of spirit and pray agree on

[1:09:15] world somebody say Amen
[1:09:18] there so now verse

[1:11:52] Babylon
[1:11:54] is not a
[1:11:56] location
[1:11:58] mystery is a
[1:12:02] spirit so FSE
[1:12:06] character is an
[1:12:08] Abomination it's detested dwelling among
[1:12:11] the
[1:12:13] saints when you have got a divisive

[1:12:23] let's go to eel 22
[1:12:26] here another Abomination
[1:12:30] here verse
[1:12:32] 11 and one has committed Abomination
[1:12:37] with his neighbor's
[1:12:41] wife and another half Lely defiled his
[1:12:52] da

[1:13:01] sister his father's
[1:13:05] daughter he says it's an
[1:13:08] Abomination and those things are out
[1:13:12] there in
[1:13:17] secret
[1:13:22] Inc
[1:13:25] is an
[1:13:28] Abomination So speaking of the New
[1:13:34] Jerusalem in Revelation
[1:13:41] 2127 he says and shall in no wise enter
[1:13:48] into it anything that
[1:13:52] defile
[1:13:55] whether neither whatsoever work
[1:14:01] Abomination all make a
[1:14:04] lie but they which are written in the
[1:14:09] Lamb's Book of
[1:14:13] Life Hallelujah the door to the New
[1:14:17] Jerusalem you cannot enter it with an
[1:14:22] abomination amen this morning it's a
[1:14:26] morning where we drop all our
[1:14:31] Abominations and we say we are coming
[1:14:33] out of
[1:14:35] Babylon because we were
[1:14:38] told tou not their ways of
[1:14:43] life while we in the world God calls us
[1:14:46] to live above the
[1:14:50] world Amen and we thank God that today
[1:14:55] he gives us an opportunity to understand
[1:15:00] what we are
[1:15:01] called When God says come out of my
[1:15:07] people amen so this is a
[1:15:12] call Amen to make our lives
[1:15:17] right to wash away all the
[1:15:22] elements of Babylon amen he said there
[1:15:26] is no man that will enter there with an
[1:15:31] Abomination so stay away from the
[1:15:35] Abominations of babyon
[1:15:38] because
[1:15:42] no amen now eel chter 9 and verse
[1:15:49] one the holy spirit
[1:15:52] says
[1:15:54] listen to this text of
[1:16:00] scripture very
[1:16:03] carefully he cried also in my ears with
[1:16:06] a loud
[1:16:10] voices cause them that have church over
[1:16:14] the city to draw
[1:16:18] near even never man with his destroying
[1:16:22] weapon in his
[1:16:28] hand now these were the
[1:16:31] men that were supposed to guard
[1:16:35] Jerusalem but God is Anointed with
[1:16:40] Jerusalem because of the
[1:16:44] Abominations and he tells the
[1:16:47] men in that vision of
[1:16:50] Jeremiah that you gods
[1:16:53] come with your
[1:16:58] sword so they had rejected the message
[1:17:02] of
[1:17:05] Ezekiel and any form of rejection to the
[1:17:10] word results into
[1:17:15] judgment see and doing what seeth right
[1:17:19] in our
[1:17:22] judgment
[1:17:24] is an
[1:17:26] Abomination it's not me who can know
[1:17:30] what's
[1:17:31] right it's God who knows what is
[1:17:35] right and when he speaks to
[1:17:38] me God have
[1:17:40] mercy that I may keep under the
[1:17:44] blood washing every
[1:17:47] day when he makes me know this is from
[1:17:51] Babylon I wash it
[1:17:56] off I don't want to get to that
[1:18:00] door amen together with an
[1:18:06] Abomination so today this morning it's a
[1:18:09] washing
[1:18:11] time to wash away the
[1:18:14] Abominations come out of her is not
[1:18:19] geographical come out of her it's
[1:18:23] spiritual condition that you come out of
[1:18:27] to come into higher
[1:18:30] order amen praise the Lord Disobedience
[1:18:34] to the voice of the
[1:18:36] world Amen brings forth
[1:18:39] judgment but then among
[1:18:44] them in the six men that were
[1:18:47] called there was one that did not carry
[1:18:51] a judgment
[1:18:55] weapon amen six
[1:18:59] men and then there was
[1:19:03] one praise God he didn't have a judgment
[1:19:20] weapon amen are you together with me
[1:19:24] praise the Lord the Bible says let me
[1:19:28] take you back to verse
[1:19:30] one
[1:19:32] here and behold six men
[1:19:36] came from the higher from the higher
[1:19:43] gate which Li toward the
[1:19:48] North and every man a Slaughter weapon
[1:19:52] in his
[1:19:55] and one man among them was closed
[1:20:02] with one
[1:20:04] man together with them amen he was
[1:20:08] carrying the writers inor by his
[1:20:15] side and they went in and stood by the
[1:20:21] altar six
[1:20:24] but the Bible says one of them among
[1:20:28] them did not have a destroying
[1:20:32] weapon and they
[1:20:34] stood by the
[1:20:37] altar the people should have brought
[1:20:40] their
[1:20:41] offerings sin
[1:20:44] offerings to The Altar for forgiveness
[1:20:49] of sins but now the time was over
[1:20:54] we don't want to be CAU into
[1:20:59] that so they were standing right there
[1:21:03] with their killer
[1:21:06] weapon amen so there was
[1:21:10] one that was in fine
[1:21:13] Ling was a unique
[1:21:16] man he was holding
[1:21:20] an and so when the judgement on sin is
[1:21:24] hitting the
[1:21:28] ungodly there is always the seventh
[1:21:31] man waiting to
[1:21:34] see what side you
[1:21:38] take amen and this man when you make a
[1:21:44] decision he puts a
[1:21:46] seal of
[1:21:48] protection upon
[1:21:51] you he
[1:21:53] stands right there with an
[1:21:57] eon who is on my
[1:22:00] side and if you come to the Lord
[1:22:03] side you get
[1:22:08] an amen and that
[1:22:11] Mark was the
[1:22:14] security because the man with the
[1:22:18] sword were not supposed to touch these
[1:22:21] people
[1:22:23] that have walked away from the
[1:22:26] Abominations are you out of the
[1:22:28] Abominations this
[1:22:31] morning amen
[1:22:35] he that can SE your
[1:22:37] way from the oncoming storms of
[1:22:41] judgment so the Breen

[1:22:50] already condemned
[1:22:54] hallelujah praise God it
[1:22:58] stands for sin
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:06] already and it was
[1:23:09] judged but here was
[1:23:11] some that had rejected the forgiveness
[1:23:15] of
[1:23:19] sin are you together with the altar the
[1:23:24] Breen
[1:23:25] altar
[1:23:27] represents the Lord Jesus Christ on
[1:23:31] Calvary that he has already paid the
[1:23:35] price of getting you out of the
[1:23:38] Abomination are you together with me yes
[1:23:41] sir and the Judgment that we face is
[1:23:46] when we reject that
[1:23:49] offer when we reject the atonement

[1:23:59] people amen so brother Bram in the
[1:24:03] message listen these men stand at the

[1:37:37] the he says throw everything
[1:37:42] out okay let's get back to babyon a
[1:37:45] little
[1:37:46] bit now let us understand this babyon
[1:37:51] whose
[1:37:53] Abominations they kept posting from
[1:37:55] Kingdom to another
[1:38:00] kingdom now listen in the Heen
[1:38:05] kingdoms the
[1:38:07] kings were
[1:38:09] also the heads of Heen
[1:38:15] worship are you together with me so when
[1:38:18] this King came and overcome this
[1:38:22] King he takes the
[1:38:24] king together with his
[1:38:28] gods and he adds to his
[1:38:30] God Abomination upon
[1:38:33] Abomination through the kingdoms until
[1:38:36] they come to us and they diffuse into
[1:38:40] the
[1:38:44] church are you together with the
[1:38:48] Philistines when they came and in during
[1:38:51] the time of
[1:38:53] Eli they also wanted to take the god of
[1:38:59] Israel is is not captured amen amen they
[1:39:03] said you come and take your
[1:39:08] God Amen because he's a jealous
[1:39:12] God when they put him in their
[1:39:14] Temple he slaughtered their God called
[1:39:18] dag the following that they found when
[1:39:21] had
[1:39:22] fallen AR you happy that you serve a
[1:39:25] jealous
[1:39:27] God he doesn't need anything dir in our
[1:39:31] lives it's a house cleaning
[1:39:35] time amen so now let's go and look and
[1:39:39] understand this
[1:39:42] babon Genesis chter
[1:39:44] 10 and verse
[1:39:47] eight the Bible says and
[1:39:54] beg he began to be a might
[1:40:01] one
[1:40:04] beg and he began to be might one in the
[1:40:10] earth meaning that
[1:40:12] Nim came to a time when he failed to
[1:40:16] handle his
[1:40:19] f
[1:40:21] we need to be
[1:40:23] careful when the Lord lifts
[1:40:27] us we don't fall in the weakness of
[1:40:33] nimrod he became a mighty
[1:40:36] one what does the past have to tell
[1:40:41] me he became so
[1:40:44] famous until he also decided to start
[1:40:47] his own
[1:40:49] church
[1:40:54] are you together with me become so
[1:40:57] famous he doesn't see anything
[1:41:00] good everything is bad bad upon bad
[1:41:06] amen failed to handle his
[1:41:11] Fame and
[1:41:13] verse he was a mighty Hunter before the
[1:41:19] Lord wherefore it is
[1:41:21] say
[1:41:24] even might hun before the
[1:41:28] Lord and the beginning of his
[1:41:31] kingdom
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:37] was in the land
[1:41:41] of now the Bible says he was a mighty
[1:41:46] Hunter but he was not hunting them
[1:41:52] amen he was not hunting for
[1:41:55] Animals he was hunting for
[1:41:59] Regions to bring them under
[1:42:02] him the Bible says he was a mighty
[1:42:06] H in
[1:42:08] verse then in verse 10 the beginning of
[1:42:12] his
[1:42:15] kingdom are you together with me so and
[1:42:19] that's why the Bible says and the
[1:42:23] beginning of his
[1:42:26] kingdom so we now get into Genesis
[1:42:30] 11 the Genesis 11 account
[1:42:36] says that
[1:42:38] nimod instituted himself into a
[1:42:44] king the beginning of his
[1:42:47] kingdom and then later He makes himself
[1:42:52] a
[1:42:53] priest to a
[1:42:55] religion that desires to go to heaven
[1:42:58] without the
[1:43:01] word we shall uphold the
[1:43:07] Abominations and still go to
[1:43:10] heaven our women will put
[1:43:14] ones and we shall still go to
[1:43:17] heaven they will dress
[1:43:19] Cly still got
[1:43:23] heaven and this days say they say God
[1:43:27] looks at the
[1:43:29] heart but my Bible says what is in the
[1:43:33] heart is what comes
[1:43:37] out you got Proverbs
[1:43:40] 7 the bible says there was that L
[1:43:45] woman and the Bible says she was
[1:43:49] dressed in the clothes of a
[1:43:53] prostitute so there are certain clothes
[1:43:56] which don't belong to
[1:44:06] us if you are a
[1:44:08] lady and you are not married the only
[1:44:12] person that should be seeing your
[1:44:15] body is the man you are going to
[1:44:19] marry and if you are
[1:44:22] you should cover your
[1:44:23] body because it's for your
[1:44:27] husband but you put on things and you
[1:44:30] put a to
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:42] this and when you go to church you car
[1:44:48] newspapers or you go with a
[1:44:53] you are cover
[1:44:57] here if you want people to see you show
[1:45:01] don't
[1:45:04] hide are you together with me praise the
[1:45:09] Lord yes sir you see so in the
[1:45:15] subsequent
[1:45:18] kingdoms as n
[1:45:21] conquered the Conquering
[1:45:25] king would take the
[1:45:30] kingdom and then they are
[1:45:32] Gods so they kept multiplying the
[1:45:38] Abominations but notti that the god of
[1:45:41] Israel as I already told you they could
[1:45:45] not be taken
[1:45:49] hostage so the the pH fa to take the
[1:45:52] instruments of
[1:45:56] God I mean uh you know
[1:46:01] Nebuchadnezzar he fa he wanted to use
[1:46:04] the instruments of the
[1:46:10] Tabernacle that he got from
[1:46:13] Jerusalem and when he
[1:46:16] did the handwriting came
[1:46:19] up
[1:46:21] from a
[1:46:23] hand and started
[1:46:25] writing many
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:33] many and he
[1:46:36] trembled he wanted
[1:46:39] interpreters but the men who lived above
[1:46:44] the Kingdom Life of
[1:46:49] Babylon
[1:46:51] are the ones who had the
[1:46:54] interpretation that your put being the
[1:46:58] interpretation was you've been put in
[1:47:00] the
[1:47:02] balance and you are been found
[1:47:06] wanting and your kingdom is taken
[1:47:12] away and the Bible says he was given the
[1:47:19] heart
[1:47:21] of a
[1:47:22] beast and he left the
[1:47:25] palace and he went into the Beast I mean
[1:47:28] the field and he was eating together
[1:47:31] with
[1:47:33] beasts and God protected him from the
[1:47:38] Lions seven
[1:47:41] years so
[1:47:45] that of what the beast in the New
[1:47:48] Testament
[1:47:49] is
[1:47:51] it's not going to be an
[1:47:54] animal it's a man who has rejected the
[1:47:59] order of the
[1:48:04] word let's go to Revelation
[1:48:12] 179 and here is the
[1:48:15] mind which has
[1:48:19] wisdom
[1:48:21] the seven
[1:48:23] heads of the
[1:48:25] Beast are seven
[1:48:28] mountains on which the woman
[1:48:32] sits and here are seven
[1:48:35] Kings they counting
[1:48:38] them five have
[1:48:43] fallen and one
[1:48:48] is and the together is not yet
[1:48:54] come and when he
[1:48:57] cometh he must continue a short
[1:49:02] space let's go to Bible teaching
[1:49:05] now amen now babyon
[1:49:10] system has been
[1:49:13] changing colors like the horse riders
[1:49:16] change
[1:49:19] colors
[1:49:21] and this system has come
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:24] through by protection of political
[1:49:29] power throughout
[1:49:33] history you hear the people who speak
[1:49:36] about
[1:49:37] us we are not going to allow government
[1:49:40] these men to
[1:49:44] operate because
[1:49:47] religion power
[1:49:53] verse
[1:49:54] 11 and the peace that
[1:49:57] was and is
[1:50:00] not even he is the
[1:50:03] eth and is of the
[1:50:06] seventh and go
[1:50:09] with so this is just like is and is
[1:50:16] not is and is
[1:50:19] not just like
[1:50:22] succession a system of men that one dies
[1:50:27] and another
[1:50:29] takes is and is
[1:50:32] not so now let us look at s major
[1:50:40] kingdoms that have come through
[1:50:43] history we've got
[1:50:46] Egypt it was a mighty power that ruled
[1:50:49] the world one
[1:50:52] time they were beaten Away by
[1:50:56] Assyria and the Assyrians took the gods
[1:50:59] of Egypt
[1:51:01] there amen and then Assyria was beaten
[1:51:06] by
[1:51:08] Babylon you know we've had all these
[1:51:10] kind of
[1:51:12] Kingdoms until we
[1:51:14] come to the Pagan
[1:51:17] R so in the time of John the
[1:51:21] Apostle when he was on the island
[1:51:25] ofos the scripture says five Kings had
[1:51:32] fallen and one
[1:51:34] is which makes him
[1:51:37] six amen and then he continues for a
[1:51:41] short
[1:51:42] space but when he comes back there is a
[1:51:46] seven is of the seventh and of the
[1:51:48] e
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:58] let us look at the New Testament
[1:52:06] era and the fall of the first church in
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:14] Rome the New Testament
[1:52:18] Church the m
[1:52:21] Kingdom starts in the
[1:52:24] era when Rome ruled the
[1:52:29] world the
[1:52:32] Caesar you see next time I
[1:52:35] come God will give me Grace that I may
[1:52:39] parade those kingdoms as they keep
[1:52:41] coming and
[1:52:45] going so you know at that time
[1:52:50] we have the church edge of
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:55] Ephesus
[1:52:57] then and then the Church of
[1:53:00] pamos when the church
[1:53:04] fell in the age of
[1:53:09] pamus some of you may not understand the
[1:53:12] foundations of the church
[1:53:17] ages I remember brother
[1:53:23] is gone to live with the Lord he says
[1:53:26] when I came to
[1:53:28] church you were teaching complicated
[1:53:33] things but my heart was telling me don't
[1:53:38] move this is the
[1:53:41] place he says just one
[1:53:44] day as I was
[1:53:46] following I broke into a superatural
[1:53:51] understanding of where you were trying
[1:53:53] to take the
[1:53:56] church and when he left us here in the
[1:54:00] 90s he went and became a foundation for
[1:54:03] the church in
[1:54:06] M
[1:54:08] amen and then his son came back to Mar
[1:54:11] brother's
[1:54:15] daughter so let's go to Revelation
[1:54:18] Chapter 2 and we see what the spirit
[1:54:19] says about
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:24] pagam and to the church and to the end
[1:54:26] of the church
[1:54:28] in
[1:54:32] right this thing says he which has the
[1:54:36] Shar sword with two
[1:54:41] edges he needed to
[1:54:45] SW because in the AG of
[1:54:48] P amen
[1:54:50] there was the manifestation of the
[1:54:54] Fall
[1:54:56] Satan had taken a seat in the
[1:55:02] temple so in this edge here praise the
[1:55:06] Lord this is where the Deeds of the
[1:55:10] nians formulated themselves
[1:55:15] into do you know what the de of the nans
[1:55:18] are
[1:55:20] these are the
[1:55:22] Deeds you hear the
[1:55:26] word and you say it's
[1:55:30] right but then it should not hold on
[1:55:36] me in nature of the spirit of
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:41] iniquity but you are
[1:55:44] silent about it it is a spirit that is
[1:55:49] telling you
[1:55:51] no so the Same
[1:55:54] Spirit went into the next Church
[1:55:57] age and began to question the
[1:56:01] word and the third
[1:56:03] age a doctrine of one belief to answer
[1:56:08] the
[1:56:09] doubts was
[1:56:11] established and the head was also
[1:56:18] appointed
[1:56:20] okay so in this age of
[1:56:23] pamos the Deeds of the
[1:56:26] nans formulated into
[1:56:29] doct this is when we have the great
[1:56:34] Council where they broughten the Trinity
[1:56:40] Doctrine instead of the one
[1:56:43] God and this is the same
[1:56:46] age where baptism changes
[1:56:50] from the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:53] Christ to father son Holy
[1:56:57] Ghost and in the same time they rejected
[1:57:01] baptism by
[1:57:04] imersive because some of the people were
[1:57:06] too
[1:57:08] important to be put in the
[1:57:13] water verse
[1:57:15] 13 he says I Know Thy
[1:57:17] works and where th
[1:57:21] dwst even where Satan's seat
[1:57:26] is and thou holdest fast my
[1:57:31] name and has not denied my
[1:57:35] Fai and as in the days
[1:57:38] where my faithful
[1:57:45] matter slain among
[1:57:47] you where Satan
[1:57:53] DW I'm trying to
[1:57:55] bring something that's very very
[1:57:59] important and then we lay today's
[1:58:02] service
[1:58:06] down the True Believers of
[1:58:09] PAG they held on the authority of the
[1:58:13] name and the Divinity of the
[1:58:18] faith they lived
[1:58:22] above the systems of the word at the
[1:58:27] time amen but then the
[1:58:32] unbelievers they try to kill all the
[1:58:35] truth of the
[1:58:38] world so
[1:58:40] pamos is the
[1:58:42] age which directly puts the
[1:58:46] church and Babylon
[1:58:52] together listen to what brother Bram
[1:58:57] says
[1:58:59] now up to this
[1:59:01] time I've not brought out the point in
[1:59:06] history I promise to
[1:59:09] cover that is
[1:59:14] intermingling of the religion of
[1:59:18] nim and the Christian
[1:59:24] religion are you together with me
[1:59:27] Nim
[1:59:29] believed one can go to heaven without
[1:59:31] the
[1:59:33] word
[1:59:35] anybody who dises the word and wants to
[1:59:38] go to
[1:59:40] heaven that's the religion of
[1:59:45] nimod so that kind of understanding
[1:59:50] was
[1:59:52] intermingled in the Christian
[1:59:56] church when they think you can hold
[2:00:01] Abominations and still enter the New
[2:00:07] Jerusalem he says you will
[2:00:11] recall that at loose fled from Babylon
[2:00:15] to
[2:00:18] pamos
[2:00:22] during the time of the wars between this
[2:00:24] and
[2:00:27] that
[2:00:29] soal was a king now babon under
[2:00:35] [Music]
[2:00:36] attack he
[2:00:39] fled and set up his
[2:00:42] kingdom that outside the riches of the
[2:00:46] Roman
[2:00:48] Empire
[2:00:51] it flourished over the
[2:00:54] years a succession of the priest
[2:01:12] king until the Reign ofal
[2:01:18] the this one comes then another one
[2:01:21] comes then another one just
[2:01:27] like you cannot be a king you are
[2:01:32] poor so you must be
[2:01:35] S to replace the father so it kept going
[2:01:39] like that until they came to atus the
[2:01:44] thir and for
[2:01:48] reasons known only to the sovereignity
[2:01:50] of
[2:01:52] God he took his
[2:01:54] kingdom and gave it
[2:01:59] through but he has
[2:02:01] come they are winning and then taking
[2:02:10] God
[2:02:12] now he says I'm tired of being a
[2:02:17] king throws the kingdom to the
[2:02:21] Romans Julius Caesar jar then took both
[2:02:26] the
[2:02:31] kingdom
[2:02:34] and for he became Pon
[2:02:40] Maximus Pon
[2:02:42] Maximus of the babon
[2:02:46] religion and therefore
[2:02:49] was Priest and
[2:02:54] King and we hear of P
[2:02:59] Maximus Max that was a
[2:03:05] title from a heathen
[2:03:09] Kingdom so it were thrown to
[2:03:13] Rome and then the Roman
[2:03:16] Cesar became PTI
[2:03:21] he continues to say this title passed
[2:03:27] on I mean following
[2:03:31] Emperor until the time
[2:03:37] Max refused
[2:03:40] it according to
[2:03:43] history it was then that the
[2:03:47] pop took the leip of the
[2:03:52] emperor that he
[2:03:54] rejected and today
[2:03:57] we
[2:04:04] Max the
[2:04:07] secret Myster the
[2:04:12] mighton agency the mother of all house
[2:04:15] and Abomination of the
[2:04:17] world refus to the
[2:04:22] kingdom and gave it to the Roman
[2:04:26] Catholic
[2:04:31] church and took the same
[2:04:36] title
[2:04:37] Maximus
[2:04:44] Maximus
[2:04:46] mystery he wears a triple cross
[2:04:54] he says he has power in
[2:04:57] heaven on Earth and under the
[2:05:03] Earth so in Revelation
[2:05:08] 17 God does not any longer refer pamos
[2:05:12] as sat's
[2:05:16] seat does he say that is where Satan
[2:05:23] dwells no the throne
[2:05:27] room is no longer in
[2:05:30] P it is my
[2:05:33] babon it's the
[2:05:36] Babylon mother ofs and Abominations of
[2:05:39] the
[2:05:42] Earth are you picking
[2:05:45] it and when the pur took the authority
[2:05:51] amen fromus the I mean from third I mean
[2:05:55] the Caesar the third
[2:05:57] one lots of this
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:06] mysticism came and filtered into the
[2:06:12] church and people will
[2:06:15] die to prove that Jesus was was born on
[2:06:19] 25th
[2:06:25] December and when we say we don't have a
[2:06:28] meeting on
[2:06:42] Christmas they came up with a lot of
[2:06:45] things they worshiped the number of God
[2:06:50] when the Bible spoke about the father
[2:06:53] they said that's one
[2:06:55] son and then the son that's a
[2:06:59] second so now there are
[2:07:03] three the
[2:07:06] mysticism and that's what and where we
[2:07:11] are called out
[2:07:16] of we are called out of the
[2:07:20] mix of Heen
[2:07:24] culture and the Godless
[2:07:29] religion we should be
[2:07:32] careful even as we keep coming
[2:07:36] through not import the traditions of the
[2:07:39] Fallen
[2:07:43] Kingdom into the messic
[2:07:47] kingdom
[2:07:49] people come from
[2:07:51] Pentecost and they bring the traditions
[2:07:53] of
[2:07:55] pentec you know I minister in those
[2:07:59] churches I take the message to them and
[2:08:02] I want brother
[2:08:04] James Sometimes to start doing some bit
[2:08:07] of videos here to show you what we do
[2:08:11] there sometimes you go to one of these
[2:08:13] new
[2:08:15] churches they have loved your ministry
[2:08:25] when you go there there is a parade of
[2:08:30] women worship
[2:08:35] team I will not
[2:08:39] say and they come to the
[2:08:42] pastors that's where they dance then
[2:08:45] they turn like
[2:08:47] this
[2:08:52] and then when you
[2:08:54] preach you bring the word those things
[2:08:57] begin to
[2:08:59] die
[2:09:01] Abominations that have been carrying on
[2:09:04] and carrying on and
[2:09:07] caring so when we say come out of her my
[2:09:13] people you are coming out of a fallen
[2:09:17] system
[2:09:19] into the blood of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:21] Christ to be part of a Divine
[2:09:27] Kingdom so colians 1
[2:09:31] verse amen as we finish here giving
[2:09:35] thanks unto the
[2:09:37] Father which has made us me to be
[2:09:39] partakers of The Inheritance with the
[2:09:45] Saints so we are called intern
[2:09:50] inheritance like Abraham was called
[2:09:53] inter
[2:09:54] inheritance amen so in verse 13 he says
[2:10:00] he has delivered us from the power of
[2:10:04] darkness and has translated us into the
[2:10:08] kingdom of his
[2:10:11] dear hallelujah hallelujah we are
[2:10:15] called into the church
[2:10:18] we are called out of
[2:10:21] bab to come and take our
[2:10:24] inheritance in the Kingdom of
[2:10:27] his somebody say Amen there amen and now
[2:10:32] in the Kingdom of his dear
[2:10:34] son that's where we have
[2:10:38] Redemption through his blood and then
[2:10:41] forgiveness of s that's verse 14 once we
[2:10:47] get to the kingdom of
[2:10:50] his brother let me tell you one thing we
[2:10:54] have the forgiveness of
[2:10:56] sin amen I mean we've got the
[2:10:59] Redemption and then the forgiveness of
[2:11:02] sin we are redeemed
[2:11:05] from then
[2:11:07] into hallelujah praise God from a
[2:11:11] kingdom of darkness the kingdom of Life
[2:11:15] redeemed from the wicked traditions
[2:11:21] ofon is the kingdom
[2:11:24] of so this
[2:11:26] Kingdom that we get into is the
[2:11:29] Messianic
[2:11:30] Kingdom and in that Kingdom we have the
[2:11:34] blood
[2:11:35] Redemption and then the Forgiveness
[2:11:39] of it's a kingdom that's not
[2:11:44] joined it's a kingdom where you are born
[2:11:47] into
[2:11:49] hallelujah hallelujah have you been born
[2:11:52] again have you been born into the
[2:11:54] kingdom Hallelujah those who are born
[2:11:58] into the kingdom they got their
[2:12:01] citizenship in heaven they've got their
[2:12:05] names on the Lamb's Book of Life they
[2:12:08] got the
[2:12:09] boldness to walk away from the
[2:12:14] Abominations
[2:12:17] ofon
[2:12:18] Amen in him we already have our
[2:12:23] Redemption but as we
[2:12:26] saw we may
[2:12:28] see in the journey but even then we
[2:12:33] still have the forgiveness of
[2:12:35] sin when we place our sins under the
[2:12:40] blood somebody say man again so we need
[2:12:44] to put our little
[2:12:47] Abominations
[2:12:48] that we carried with ourselves from
[2:12:52] Babylon our former
[2:12:54] religions and we put them away and we
[2:12:58] take our lives and put it under the
[2:13:02] blood the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:05] which
[2:13:06] speak better things than the blood
[2:13:11] of the blood of Jesus which promises you
[2:13:14] an
[2:13:16] inheritance amen
[2:13:18] so the this morning we can put all our
[2:13:22] sin under the
[2:13:23] blood and the blood that already granted
[2:13:27] us the
[2:13:29] Redemption will also
[2:13:32] continue to give us the forgiveness if
[2:13:36] we end doubt in the Abominations of
[2:13:43] Babylon this is a Messianic Kingdom
[2:13:46] where we still have the blood on the
[2:13:50] altar John says if we confess our sins
[2:13:55] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[2:13:58] our sins and cleanse us from all
[2:14:01] unrighteousness you are here therefore
[2:14:04] because of a blood
[2:14:07] Redemption but when you fall you have
[2:14:10] the Forgiveness of sins if we have been
[2:14:13] holding certain
[2:14:16] Abominations in our Liv
[2:14:19] then the call out
[2:14:21] ofon is loud and
[2:14:24] clear let us get the
[2:14:28] boldness to enter under the control of
[2:14:30] the
[2:14:32] blood that we can step into the
[2:14:36] Redemption and then maintain the
[2:14:38] Forgiveness of
[2:14:40] sins amen Hebrews
[2:14:44] 10
[2:14:46] verse now
[2:14:48] of
[2:14:50] these there is no more offering for
[2:14:55] sin I want you to understand in the Old
[2:14:59] Testament they gave the atonement
[2:15:02] sacrifice year after
[2:15:06] year but now in the New Testament when
[2:15:11] the
[2:15:13] lamb he does it
[2:15:16] once am now where remission of this
[2:15:21] is there is no more offering of
[2:15:26] sin having therefore
[2:15:29] Brethren the
[2:15:31] boldness to enter into
[2:15:34] the in the blood of
[2:15:39] Jesus to enter into the
[2:15:42] rest you need to take a
[2:15:46] step into the messic
[2:15:49] Kingdom by the blood of
[2:15:52] Jesus to where our
[2:15:55] Christ the son of
[2:15:57] God the priest of our I mean of our
[2:16:01] fallen
[2:16:04] condition that's where we step
[2:16:07] into it is a finished work and Paul says
[2:16:12] when he had by himself packed our
[2:16:16] SE sat down on the right hand of the
[2:16:22] Majesty it is finished the sin is
[2:16:26] wor that's why he says when you come in
[2:16:31] you receive the
[2:16:33] Redemption every past is washed
[2:16:36] away but as you continue you make a
[2:16:40] mistake he says we still have the
[2:16:42] Forgiveness of
[2:16:44] sins so it is the finished one
[2:16:48] he did the work and set down we only
[2:16:51] need the
[2:16:53] boldness to enter into the Hol by the
[2:16:56] blood of
[2:16:57] Jesus the
[2:17:00] B Amen to throw away all the
[2:17:04] tradition of
[2:17:06] Babylon when we say come out of her it
