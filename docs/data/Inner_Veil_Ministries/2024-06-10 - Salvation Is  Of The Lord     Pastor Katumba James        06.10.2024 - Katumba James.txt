whole day Lord service this morning the service in the afternoon and and Lord the Lord is Ser we have Lord we dedicate ourselves you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus amen let us go to the Book of Jonah and then we read from chapter 2 and then we're reading from verse 1 to verse 10 the Bible says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fishes B and said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and th hardest my voice for thou Hast cast me into the deep in the mid of the Seas and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will not look again toward yet will I look again toward thy Holy Temple the wat compassed about me even to the soul the Dos closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountain the Earth with her was about me forever thou brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I'll pay that I have V salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spoke unto the fish and vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground may God of his words you may be seated praise the name of our Lord so I want to preach about salvation EAS of the Lord praise the name of our Lord salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord at least as you come to the service today have that taken in your heart praise the name of the Lord that your Sal is all the work of the Lord praise the name of our Lord your salvation is all the work of the Lord praise the name of our Lord that should sink deep such that you know in whatever situation you may find yourself in it may be a a circumstance you don't understand you know as we live in this life we are limited praise the name of our Lord there are many things we don't know there are many things we don't understand there are many things we don't see the greatest the reality is the reality which we know is the smallest and what we don't know is the greatest praise the name of our Lord you know I think it was last year and then last year there were some tourists and then there's a man who made some kind of thing I'm forgetting how they called it but it was kind of like a speci craft rather water craft and then he made that kind of craft kind of like a vehicle you know and then he put in it everything and then he said people should pay I think was $1 million and so people about five people pay they paid and then they were going to wear the Titanic ship of what kind ofed in that ocean just to look at it so he made this thing he was the pilot and then they went but now when they reached the under the SE there was I think it was called an implosion you know something to blow up from within because of the pressure from the water itself inside wouldn't stand and they all perished and then they were writing about that and they said that the Sea World very little which is known by man they said there's too much there until you know they just don't know much now you can imagine how the Lord has made so many things praise the name of our Lord and then here the Bible is telling us that salvation is of the Lord praise the name of the Lord you see that Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden you know when they went and ate of the fruit they came to awareness that they were naked and now when they knew that they were naked in Genesis chapter 3 then they saw fig lives around their bodies and now when Adam had the voice of God walking in the garden they hid themselves but they had got fig leaves around themselves because they felt that they were naked it came to their understanding that they were naked now when they had God walking that's when they realized that the figs that put around themselves were not sufficient covering so they hid in the leaves again in the trees hiding against what praise the name of the Lord because it was only Adam and Eve in the Gard but they were hiding and you see now you look at a situation a woman lives home with body tight so you see all her figure she's walking on the street that's blindness of Satan they live home with bedroom clothes or bathroom clothes tight things transparent things and then they're afraid to walk on the streets so it's blindness until there is no shame but then now in the Garden of Eden they they knew they were naked and they tried to cover themselves and then brother Bram teaches that the Fig is a form of [Music] religion like people want to belong to a religion I belong to this religion I blame to this religion I blame to this religion and some of them when you talk about them about salvation they say this is my father's religion this is my mother's religion you know it's your fathers your mothers how about you you have to make your own decision praise the name of our Lord and this is our family religion God demands each and every one of us to make a personal decision about your personal walk with Christ praise the name of our Lord so now Adam their religion was not enough to remove their nakedness even now religion is not enough to bring Salvation praise the name of our Lord our works are not enough to bring our Salvation our Good Conduct is not enough to bring our Salvation whatever we do is not enough to bring our salvation Salvation is all of the Lord praise the name of our Lord It's the Lord that works that salvation in your so now God had to find you know then when he reached the place of Fellowship you know where they were meant to congregate because they were meeting at the every evening in the co of the day now when he goes to church when he goes to the place of Fellowship he wouldn't get Adam there you don't get Eve there it's also the same thing for us God comes to the place of Fellowship but then when he comes will he find you there will he find you in your position praise the name of our Lord or you would have excuses or you have programs to or I'm busy today I have this kind of activity today but God brother brandham teaches us that Jesus Christ he keeps his appointments when he said where two or three are gathered in my name I will be there in the minut but then the question is where he has appointed to meet us will you will he find you there praise the name of our Lord then the Bible says will he find you so doing praise the name of our Lord So Adam they were running away from the presence of God until God said Adam where are you and then said now we are here we are hiding ourselves we are afraid of you Adam praise the name of the Lord Adam was very sincere and that's how we approach to God sincere when you come before the presence of God Lord I'm naked Lord I was afraid of you at least God had his voice how about your voice is God hearing your voice about the condition you are in this morning about the things you're going through in this morning about the things that are troubling you today you tell Lord this is my problem Lord this is my trouble Lord this is my weakness Adam confessed Lord let us go to Genesis chapter 3 praise the name of our Lord Genesis chapter 3 and then verse 7 and The Eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves arons and they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of God amongst the Trees of the garden and this is what sin always does sin will always make you afraid of the presence of God Satan taking you further sin will always make you dislike coming to church you don't like Fellowship will always make you not wanting to have time of prayer sin will always make you not having time to read your Bible you don't have time to read your message books you don't have time you know to listen to the message or to listen to the sermons sin will always make you too busy until you don't have time like every morning we have a morning devotion or morning meditation then even in the evening so you are too busy to put on your phone and listen what the pastor is exting you are too busy the 10 minutes or 15 Mees it seems is a whole day to you so it is SE that has drawn you away from that and that's what happened with Adam you know God was walking in the garden and then he came to the place of fellowship and he couldn't find their Adam and then God was concerned about Adam it's not that God didn't know what Adam was in but God keeps his appointments praise the name of the Lord when they immediately se he came at his time praise the name of the Lord he came in his time and then he said Adam where are you you should also be the same thing this morning that the Lord may be asking you where are you what is troubling you what is binding you praise the name of our Lord like you know the times of Jeremiah and then God was asking is it because there is no B [Music] in praise the name of the Lord and then you find that the son of Ahab you know he had de clim maybe a storage building and then he fell through you know space and then he got wounds and they were so Grievous then he sent one of his servants to go to the gods of B to ask them can I recover then God sends Elijah and tells him is it because there's no God in Israel but you see sin always wants to bring wrong suggestions to you and then some people when they in trouble then the devil tells them maybe they bewitching me let me also go to a witch doctor you know they get suggestions things which are contrary so now Adam God called Adam Adam where are you and then the Bible says and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden verse 8 in the of the day and AD and his wife hid themselves from the presence of God amongest the trees and the Lord called unto Adam said Adam where are you praise the name of the Lord the same voice this morning where are you praise the name of our Lord Brother Where are you this morning sister where are you this morning that's the concern of God where are your thoughts praise the name of the Lord all your thoughts already at a place of work tomorrow all your thoughts are to yesterday's disappointments all your thoughts are for the travels of today I don't know what I'm going to eat now would have called for the second service I don't know what I'm going to do had an appointment again there is ler when I have my team with is playing tonight maybe I'll try to watch using my phone and check you know where are you God was asking what has trapped you what has caught you in the cage praise the name of our Lord and then he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself the condition of man when he falls he can't save himself praise the name of the Lord that's the condition of man and when man fell he couldn't save himself in the message Jehovah but they wanted something for themselves that they could do do have their own creats and denominations and what more make Pharisees sades and something they could do their man is is trying to save his you can't do that God has already done it you just have to accept it and believe it the pillar of fire Leed them and guide them to lead them in a way a power Grace had provided a power to condemn their enemy and to make them free the power had already been given they crossed the Red Sea they smart Pharaoh they done all those things with Grace and then they exchang Grace for a long but that had nothing to do with the Royal Seed of Abraham so brother is telling us that the nature of man you feel you need to do something about yourself when Adam and Eve realized that they were naked they put fig leaves around it was until the presence of God came that's when they realized that their fig was not a good covering still they were naked even us also it is the same praise the name of our Lord let us go to the book of Isaiah praise the name of our Lord let's go to Isaiah chapter 65 okay we start from Isaiah 64:6 says but we are all as unlean thing and all our righteousness are filthy rugs and we do all fed as a leaf and our iniquities like wind have taken us away praise the name of our Lord says our righteousness is like filthy rugs praise the name of our Lord F our [Music] righteous was not a covering sufficient when the Lord came he was afraid of the presence of God until he ran in the in the trees and when God said Adam where are you then Adam said we are here we were afraid of your presence we hid ourselves because we are naked and sin does the same thing even to us is that sin takes you away sin takes you away from fellowship sin takes you away from the presence of God sin takes you away from the joy of the Lord sin takes you away from all the blessings of God but now this morning we want to hear that our Salvation is of the Lord Praise name of regardless of your condition this morning regardless of what you have done doesn't matter whatever you have done it's only God who can deliver you out of that and then you must have faith praise the name of the Lord that have come to church this morning I have come for my salvation I have come for my Deliverance I have come to be set free from whatever kind of bondage from whatever kind of condition that is troubling me praise the name of our Lord and you shouldn't desire today to go back home with the same bondage that that's troubling your life praise the name of the Lord you shouldn't desire today to go back with the same bad mind that you have been having but you need to stand before the Lord here I am praise the name of the Lord like Adam when he heard the voice of he said Lord I'm here but I'm naked praise the name of our Lord you also need to do the same confession Lord come to church but have this bondage Lord have come to church but have these things traveling me not come to church but have these trou praise the name of the Lord now when Adam after his realization the Bible says that God dressed them with animal skin he sacrificed an animal the blood was shed to Aton for their sins and then he covered their nakedness the same thing now Adam would not serve himself Adam would not deliver himself so we are also here this morning that is only God who can handle my Str it's only God who can deliver me from whatever condition I'm in and God knows what condition you are in praise the name of our Lord you only need to say Lord Here I Am Lord Set Me Free Lord deliver me from whatever is traveling Me Lord deliver me in whatever bondage I'm In Praise the name of our so we see in Jonah chapter 2 that Jonah was caught up in a sttion he was in the bury of the sheep of the fish for three days and three nights nobody will deliver Jon praise the name of our Lord nobody knew where Jonah was even as today may not know where you are you may be in church but you are more troubled praise the name of you have a lot of negative thoughts until you are not comfortable with everybody at home nobody knows where you are you are so troubled you are in such a great bondage Jonah was also in such a great bondage nobody would save Jonah but the Bible says Jonah Cried unto the Lord out of instraction you can also do the same thing out of in whatever condition you in and then say Lord Here I Am Lord deliver me out of this Lord deliver me out of distra your neighbors may not understand your friends may not understand your wife may not understand your husband may not understand your children not understand your parents may not be understanding but in whatever condition you are in like Jonah in the fish he cry to the Lord praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says the Lord had Jonah and he still here today praise the name of our Lord he can hear you praise the name of our Lord say Lord this is my condition praise the name of our salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord so now Jonah realized he couldn't help himself and that's also we need to realize that in the condition I'm going through in the circumstance I'm in I can't help myself so now if I can't help myself Lord help me Lord have Mery upon you you need to recognize weaknesses you need to recognize your failures and then you call upon the name of the Lord and then the Bible tells us in Romans chapter 10 praise the name of our Lord Romans chapter 10 and then verse 13 the Bible says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved [Music] how close is your salvation just a call away praise the name of Lord just desire Lord I need your help Lord I need your deliverance just a call away how far is that praise the name of our Lord I don't know when Sunday will reach do you need to call him on Sunday in when you come to realization that I'm under bondage Lord have supp me that's what you need to do and you set free how hard is that praise the name of the Lord you know some people would say you know I need to take some time and I need to go to the other Prayer Mountain and he looks at his work schedule there is no leave then he says now let me plan to get leave next month and wait on the Lord even now when you call upon him he hears you praise the name of if you're a student oh when are we getting holidays in the that the time I wait on the Lord even now praise the name of our Lord he hears praise the name of the Lord look atation of Jonah three days and three nights in the fish and then he said the RS were around my head I was at the bottom of the mountain then he said I remembered the Lord praise the name of the Lord you also need to remember God in the bondage that you may be in Lord this is my sttion this morning Lord this is my condition now and then you do what you call upon the name of the Lord and when you call upon the name of the Lord the Bible says you shall be saved you shall be delivered you shall be set free praise the name of the Lord the gospel that we have praise the name of our Lord declares Liberty the gospel that we have set the captives free praise the name of our Lord we are not like in the Old Testament where they waited for the of Liberty the of Jubilee every day is our time of Victory every day we can Proclaim that Liberty you only need to recognize your bondage and say Lord here I am set me out of this condition praise the name of the Lord you only need to realize that and you need to dislike your condition praise the name of and Lord I no longer want this kind of condition I want to be set free praise the name of our Lord I want to be loed praise the name of our Lord like when Pastor last night was talking about loose from our sins Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ and brother Bram says that washing is to be losed you know you are set free it is separated from you like the children of Israel they were under bondage for about 400 years and now when God had met told them praise the name of Lord to offer the pass of lamb and then they were reaching the Red Sea he told them those Egyptian you see you shall never see them no more praise the name of our Lord when they cross the Red Sea the Egyptians were dead that's how God sets us free from our bondages no more bound but I am free praise the name of the Lord salvation is of the Lord you have to receive it yourself you have to believe it yourself whether the condition has been there for 10 years praise the name of our Lord this is the day of Deliverance you just accept it Lord here I am I want my Deliverance I want my victory praise the name of the Lord Jonah called upon the name of the and then the Bible says and the Lord heard him praise the name of the Lord now don't allow Satan to put in your mind to put in your [Music] mind why are youing yourself there the Bible says he who made the ears oh made the eyes you mean he can't see you mean he cannot see you mean he cannot hear he made the mouth you mean he cannot speak praise the name of the Lord let us look at some scenarios praise the name of the Lord we go to Genesis chapter 4 and then we read so in verse six and the Lord said unto k Why thy Ro and th Contin Fallen if thou D SW shalt thou not be accepted and if thou dust not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and those shall rule over him praise the name of the Lord so the Lord was calling upon Kain to do well how could he do well praise the name to come by faith into his presence even us now we also need to do well how do I do well Lord this is my condition Lord I need your deliver praise the name of the Lord like in the Year of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded somebody was a slave to do well was to leave that bondage obey the trumpets praise the name of our Lord when the trumpet sounds you are free you are free you run away from that condition praise the name of but now if you they they pass from they buil from house they but you're slave you're slave now they telling you the time you have been spending with that task master working for him and it doesn't pay you you only gives you food the house health insurance if you fall sick will take you for treatment give your [Music] own you see there are some people who are bound in sttion until at some places of work some people don't want promotions because there are some benefits there when they are transferring them they have excuses you know I come from this region this but if they saying this is a time to be free why are still lock there praise the name of the Lord what benefits is there to live with the T like the children of Israel they were with the Egyptian torment but now they were saying where will be the grave praise the name of Lord you know like some people in the denominations when you tell them get they just thinking about a a church building where they're going to bring their cops and that's all why they staying there the trumpet is sounding you are free what is important is not how you're going to be bued what is important how you're going to come out of that praise the name of the Lord but looking at how to go inside but not how they going to come out whether you are buried with such great Hors like the Rich Young Ruler the Bible says he was bued you know here in we had an M there elderly man so when he was made an M when he was contesting for the second time you people V me you put me back let me be for him that was all he was looking forward the second time so he was not even believing of finishing the second time how you can imagine such so there are people who are bound in bondages [Music] this is where I benefit again if I get I will not be able to do this and this and this praise the name of our Lord but God is telling us this is the year of jubile this is the time to be delivered this is the time to be set free you accept it praise the name of the Lord was telling if you do well you'll be accepted but Kan refused to do well and so sin took over him so what did he do he goes and Dees his brother and then he escs him and then slays him now after killing AB God comes and asks Kan where is your brother am I My Brother's Keeper that kind of attitude then God pronounced judgment upon Kain now when Kan saw the Judgment was too heavy for him he prayed let us go further to that scripture verse 13 Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is great than I can bear he prayed he has killed his brother he doesn't want to die said but Lord all this curses it's too much for me too much for me then he says verse 15 and the Lord said unto him therefore whoever slay VG shall be taken on him Sevenfold you see is too much people will kill me then God says the one who kills you I punish them seven times now you can imagine a fallen man like a serpent seed like praying to God and God here how about you praise the name of Lord how about you in whatever condition don't understand whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord praise the name of our Lord take that promise as yours that when I call upon the name of the Lord He Shall Set Me Free praise the name of our Lord we can look at another example we go to the book of First Kings praise the name of our Lord First Kings chapter 2 and then we go to verse 18 God was telling Elijah go arise and meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineard of nabo with he gone down to possess it and thou shal speak unto him saying thus says the Lord hast thou killed and th taken possession and thou shallal speak unto him saying thus says the Lord in the place where dogs leaked the blood of nabo shall the dogs lick thy blood even thine andab said unto Elijah thou Hast Found Me Oh My Enemy and he answered I have found thee because thou Hast so thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord behold I'll bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that PES against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel and I'll make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of Basha the son of aijah for the provocation where withth thou has provoked me to anger and made Israel to s and of Jezebel also shall also spoke the Lord saying the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of jezrael him that dieth Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the Falls of the air eat but there was none like Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom Jezebel his wife steered up yet and he did very abdominally in following Idols according to all the things as did the amorites whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel now you can imagine the wickedness what he has done when Elijah proclaimed judgment on Earth what did do the man said Lord have upon me in verse 27 and it came to pass when Ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sack cloth upon his flesh and fasted and laid low in the SA close and went Sly and the word of the Lord came to Elijah theer saying see how Ahab humbles himself before me because he humbles himself before me I will not bring this evil in his days but in the sun days will I bring the evil upon his house if God would hear God would hear and the Bible say when the te Pray when the teers pray for the rain what happens trains on them how about you why would Satan bind you in a condition and then you think my condition nobody can help me the Lord is here to help you praise the name of the Lord that's what you need to have in your heart that the Lord is here to help and that's what Jon praise the name of the Lord said I Cried unto the Lord he was a prophet running away from the presence of and then the Lord prepared the fish and when the prophet pray to God praise the name of our Lord the Lord directed The of Salvation is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord our deliverance is of the Lord praise the name of our Lord It's Only God who understands condition and Only God who has a way out of that praise the name of the Lord you know like that song We Sing bigger than all my Mountain bigger than all my problem bigger than all my sttion you just look to God and then that there's another song which says he specializes praise the name of our Lord he thinks impossible your condition is not impossible praise the name of the Lord is to set you free to deliver you out of whatever condition you are Liv out of whatever Satan has put upon your praise the name of our Lord you only need to say Lord here I am brother Bram in the message I think Paradox praise the name of our he had a dream and he saw brethren in bondage and then they were the birs were so sick and then he said oh go help my Breen then the Lord told him you can speak praise the name of and then he spoke and the Bars were broken and then he called a certain brother brother so and so where are you God is delivering his people praise the name of the Lord even you this morning like God was calling Adam Adam where are you praise the name of our Lord what is it God is delivering his praise the name of our Lord in whatever bondage you are in God is delivering his and then Jonah say they that obser deserve lying vanities what are the lying vanities the symptoms you know the things you're going through I need to get a house but my is small I also die like my father without house lying vanity I want to have a good income but me I'm coming from a poor family

challenging the arm of Israel until even sa was afraid the man was the tallest the S were all afraid for 40 days every day G would come on the mountain and then he shouts you soul and your people choose one person come and fight me praise the name of our Lord and the challenge can be the in your life this demon of this sickness the name of Lord the accept of Jubilee our deliverance is now praise the name of the Lord you don't look at those lying vanities you don't look at the symptoms oh you know the history of this disease like now the medical people I think they WR about is ity whatever that's their limit praise the name of God is not limited praise the name of the Lord It's not limited by those kind of so you don't take those things you can change your confession praise the name of the Lord so David he didn't look what those things but he say my God the god of Israel than praise the name of our Lord so your strength is not your ability but your strength is knowing that God can deliver you that's our strength and we should get that strength that whatever I'm going through it's only God who can come down in my condition it's only God who can set me free praise the name of our Lord like Jonah can you nobody would help you but he said Lord then he said I remember the Lord and my prayer came into the temple and the Lord delivered praise the name of our Lord the
