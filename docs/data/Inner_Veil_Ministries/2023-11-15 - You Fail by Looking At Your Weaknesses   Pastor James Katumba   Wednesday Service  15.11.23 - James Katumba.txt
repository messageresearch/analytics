of this service Lord we lift them into your hands that your grace May reach unto them we bless your Holy Name forever more in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray ask this amen I greet in the name of Jesus Christ I request we go to our Bibles Hebrews chapter 4 and then verse verse 16 praise the name of our Lord Hebrews 4 verse 14 to verse 16 so the scripture says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need his word you may be seated I want to preach on the subject you fail by looking at your weaknesses praise the name of our Lord you fail by looking at your weaknesses so here the scripture is telling us in 15 that we have a high priest who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities and he was tested or tempted in all points like we go through so now the scripture here is telling us we have a high priest and he's always touched with the feeling of our infirmities praise the name of our Lord now when you look at that word infirmities you know it is so broad that you know infirmities they mean our body body weaknesses but doesn't stop at our body weaknesses you know like maybe when you are feeling you don't have strength that is an infirmity when you are sick that is an infirmity when you are not able to do something that is also an infirmity but then also infirmities can also come to the spiritual ter that you are not able to do the things of God because of your weaknesses your spiritual weaknesses and then again when you read in the scriptures again weaknesses can also mean when you lack like if you don't have money you know there's a scripture I was reading I was really wondering when we go to Acts 20 and then we read in verse 33 praise the name of our Lords 20 and then verse 33 so the scripture says here I have convered no man silver or gold or ar know that these hands have ministered unto my Necessities unto them that were with me I have shown you all things how that so laboring you ought support the we and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive now you see here is talking about to support the weak but the support of the weak people is talking about the people who don't have maybe they don't have food he's looking at it as weakness maybe they don't have clothes he's looking at it as weakness maybe they don't have accommodation he's looking at it at weakness maybe they don't have money he looking at it as weakness so he saying to learn to work that you support those who are weak and so now we see that according to the scripture weakness takes different dimensions when you lack the scripture talks about us being weak praise the name of our Lord when we go to Romans chapter 14 and then verse one praise the name of our Lord so Romans 14 and then verse one he says him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations Romans 14 for one leaveth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs so now he's talking again about eating that if somebody doesn't eat what you eat you may look at him as being weak and then in verse five one esth one day above the Earth another esth every day alike every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that the it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not the day to the Lord he does not regard it he that eateth eateth the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and gives God thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man dies to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the [Music] lordes praise the name of our Lord so then you see that the weaknesses vary from one person to another person praise the name of the Lord in different dimensions it can be your through in the body it may be in the spirit or the conditions that you are subjected to and you see what the devil always wants to do he wants you to always focus on your weaknesses he wants you to put your mind on your weaknesses and then you start judging yourself that me I can't go further praise the name of our Lord and then sometimes we think that when we have some kind of abilities then we are able to do a lot of things and yet sometimes when you think about your abilities then before God it may be contrary to what he's thinking the name of our Lord but in every situation that we are in we are called upon to depend upon the Lord praise the name of our Lord we are called upon to depend upon the Lord now when we go to Jeremiah chapter 9 and then verse 23 Jeremiah 9 and verse 23 the Bible says says the Lord let not the wise man grory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not ability at now you see the contrast here praise the name of our he says when you feel you cannot do anything that's where God Wants You Now to be that God can start using you praise the name of our Lord to LIF you to a higher stage praise the name of our Lord then he says that is right it is when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we are wanting to do it ourselves so then God looks us at us to fully depend upon him you don't start depending upon your abilities you don't start depending upon your skills you don't glory in your abilities you don't glory in your talents but then you need to know Lord I'm here I need you to take me ahead of the praise the name of and that's what God desires of us so then we shouldn't look at our Weck we shouldn't look at our failures but then we need to look to the Lord to help us all the of the praise the name of our Lord don't look at your failures praise the name of our Lord you know the Bible says let the weak say I am strong praise the name of our Lord let the poor say I am rich why I'm not looking at my poverty I'm not looking at my weaknesses I'm not looking at my failures but I'm looking to the almighty God to take all my challenges praise the name of our Lord so that's how God wants to bring us up that you know out of something which is despised out of something that is nothing he wants to get glory for himself praise the name of our Lord so then he continues to say but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we are wanting to do it ourselves and then the other side we get these feelings and we think that we are insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of God that is the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of a shape when we are insufficient our then are subject to yield to Godly Spirit praise the name of the Lord you know you just say Lord here I am praise the name of the Lord like Ezekiel in the valley of dry bondes he was taken and so the bones are scattered and then the spirit told him son man can these bones live then he was amazed how can these things which are part this then said you know Lord he was just depending upon the Lord then the Lord said do this say this then he would say it and then the bones Join one another there speak again this way so he was honestly depending upon God to bring something glorious out of nothing praise the name of our Lord and that's how the Lord also wants to use us that's how the Lord wants to lead Our Lives that's how the Lord wants to take over each and every one of our Lives when we can surrend Lord here I am on my own I can do nothing praise the name of our Lord so then when we continue he says but when we get to a place where we know we can't we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so then if it is us trying to do it we will fail but if we just yield our unto God then God cannot fail praise the name of our Lord that's why the Bible says cast all your burdens the Lord he can't fail why do you want to car your BD by yourself why do you want to call your Lord by yourself why don't you take that burden and then put it to the Lord praise the name of the Lord you know like that song bigger than all my problems bigger than Every Mountain praise the name of our Lord you just call upon him and then he will take over the whole St praise the name of our Lord then he says so as long as we are trying to trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and fall forth well we do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we are nothing then God can use Us Praise the name of our Lord it teaches us to surrender you know in your own life and say Lord you've created me Lord you've made me Lord I'm facing so many challenges I call upon you to come in this of I call upon you to come in this weakness that I have you are honestly depending upon God and you're not depending upon your abili then he says the important thing one of the important things that we must we must Master remember this espe espcially you young preachers and L members alike there is one thing that we've got to master if we have to expect fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with with our own intelligence our own abilities we got to master that in such a way we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us depending upon God not your abilities not your intelligence not your skills but just asking Lord come and guide me praise the name of our Lord and make a complete surrender go we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me praise the name of the Lord just total dependence upon God toal surrender to God praise the name of our Lord now let us go to Isaiah chter 53 and then we read from verse one so the Bible says who has believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for you shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we desired him praise the name of our Lord let us continue in verse three he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as to wear our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not Sur has born our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did a steem stream stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all praise the name of the Lord a very interesting story here that Christ came and took over all our weaknesses praise the name of the Lord he came and took over all our infirmities the Bible says he is despised and rejected of so if you are rejected if you are despised Christ took that place praise the name of our Lord then the Bible says he is a Man of Sorrows you talk about the Sorrows that you have you talk about the pains that you have you talk about the strations you go through the Bible says Christ is a Man of Sorrows he went through that that he can bring you peace and joy praise the name of the Lord then the scripture says he is acquainted with grief you know grief things that are gri things that are painful things that are not pleasant but the Bible says he is acquainted why for you and for me took your place praise the name of the Lord whatever place you are in whatever position you are in whatever situation you are in Christ came and took over that place praise the name of the Lord then the Bible says he was despised and we esteemed him not he has surely bore our grief he cared them so whatever grief and you know the word grief is also BR grief can mean your sickness grief can mean your pain brief can mean in your your destion or things that you find are not good but then the Bible says Christ carried our grief now if you believe Christ carried them then why don't you cast whatever you find is your weakness and then give it unto the LA and then stop looking at your weaknesses stop looking at your failure praise the name of the Lord it may be your weakness in the body it may be your weakness in the human spirit all the time you have evil thoughts or evil desires Christ bore our grief Christ B all that weakness so then you say Lord here I am I'm kind of encompassed with a lot of failures come and take over my failure come and take over my weakness praise the name of so we should stop looking at our weaknesses and where you have your weakness look to Christ praise the name of our Lord Brother BR preaches Look Away to Jesus praise the name of our Lord if it is Affliction Look Away to Jesus if it is failure Look Away to Jesus if there sickness Look Away to Jesus praise the name of our Lord When the Children of Israel mured against Moses and God then the Lord sent you know FY serpents among them and many of them started dying and then Moses cried to the Lord and then the Lord told Moses make a Bren Serpent and then lift it up and then he said whoever looks at the serpent will be healed and that is the same thing also for us whoever looks unto Christ praise the name of our Lord the Bible says look unto me all ends of the world and then you shall be saved so in every restation you are going through the weaknesses of the body the weaknesses of the spirit whatever kind of weakness whatever kind of infirmity Christ B all that praise the name of our Lord so then you look to Christ praise the name of the Lord you don't go back with your burdens at you don't go back with your weaknesses back but then you say Lord this is my weakness Lord this is my failure praise the name of our Lord and then you don't rejoice in your fail but just say Lord this is why I'm finding it hard I'm failing to move forward and then said Lord come and take over this St so Christ he bore all our Grace he bought all our weaknesses he bought all our failures praise the name of the Lord so just be sincere before him and tell him Lord this is my wi Lord this is my failure I have a spirit of temper I have a spirit of this I have a spirit of this praise the name of the Lord like Mary Magdalene praise the name of our Lord she had infirmities in Luke chapter and then verse two praise the name of our Lord luk Luke 8 and verse 2 the scripture says and and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called magad out of whom went seven devs [Music] praise the name of the Lord very mag had infirmities and evil spirits and you know that evil spirits they bring infirmities praise the name of our Lord they bring infirmities in our body sicknesses then they bring infirmities in our human Spirits evil habits sin Wicked wickedness but Mary Magdalene was delivered of all her infirmities now in the message questions and answers brother Bram says and two3 of the earth is in and more than that which two3 of the Angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into the people and habitate their body see what I mean they are demons they once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature and then you find that somebody so angry a demon of anger has given him that nature somebody saw despising the demon of despising has given him that nature and even his body reflects what that demon is inside so then brother Bram says Jesus cast them out of Mary Magdalene pride is a demon praise the name of the Lord just too proud so it's a demon that gives you that nature that is an infirmity PR a name of our Lord but Christ died to take away that infirmity praise the name of then boasting big people you see me that's a demon it's a nature uncleanness filthy then vity you know speak emulations and then strife says all these things praise the name of the Lord they infirmities but now the Bible has told us that Christ he bore our griefs every one of the weakness that you may have call upon the name of the Lord and let Christ take over that position praise the name of the Lord let Christ take over that position and bring you Deliverance in Luke Chapter 13 and then verse 11 verse3 the scripture says and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was born to B together and could in no wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou at loose from thy infirmity and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified God now amen praise the name of the Lord so now you see here this one here had an infirmity that she was bought she couldn't lift herself she wouldn't walk her limbs were weak but now when she met Christ Christ losed her from her infirmity body infirmity Mary Magdalene had a spiritual infirmity all our infirmities Christ bore them all our infirmities he came and took them away so then we don't look at our weaknesses but then we look at Christ who has taken over all our weaknesses praise the name and God wants us to depend upon him you know where you depend upon him the Lord come and take over all my failures come and take over all my weaknesses and everything that we have need of Christ has fully PCH praise the name of our Lord he died for our Redemption and it is so simple that you just have to believe him and all that you have need of comes forth just believing in him in the message godding himself in Simplicity oh how can I be complete how can I be complete because the blood not me but the blood stands between me and God I accepted it and he put it I'm a sinner but he is God but the chemistry the blood stands between me the kill of sin so God sees me just as white you know that's as in the bleach my sin is gone I it can't even reach him because there is a sacrifice laying there where is our faith to believe the simple word of God just what God say take him at his word God hies himself now in Simplicity in a humble little Bunch but one of these days he will manifest himself as he has always in the days passed by then he says do you love him praise the name of the Lord see how simple God does has brought it to us praise the name of the Lord It's just believe in Christ praise the name of the Lord just have faith and you know when they were telling them to apply the blood during The Exodus he told them use already the blood has been shed but then we need the high soap and so was common we even on the wall you would find the everywhere you would find the so you get the and then put in the blood so you get the high soap and then you put in the blood and apply to your condition and then brother Bram says represented Faith common fath by his stripes I was here just have faith in that then you are delivered from your sick he Bor by griefs believe that and then you overcome any habit you going through praise the name of the Lord just apply the just apply the the faith when you are in transgressions you know he says he was wounded for our [Music] transgression and then the Lord takes over that Str then the Bible says he was bruised for our iniquities then you apply that and then the iniquity goes the chastisement of our peace was upon him if you are troubled there is peace here and then he says with his stripes we are healed praise the name of the Lord so then we need to accept the finished work at carv Lord come in my position come and take over the situation I'm going come and take over the condition that I'm going so then you don't look at your weakness praise the name of our Lord but many times you want lament about our weakness we want about our failures but then we need to just say Lord this is thetion I'm going through I have too much uncertainity in my life come and take over this because you know the end from the beginning and you honestly yield yourself to take over your situation praise the name of our Lord now in Jon chapter 2 and then verse S the Bible says when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy Holy Temple that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy they that observe now the Bible is telling us when you look at lying vanities your weaknesses your infirmities you are forsaking your owny so you fail by looking at your weaknesses but then you need to look to the Lord who has called us and say Lord here I am praise the name of the Lord so you despise those lying vanities because they they are temporary you know they are just there for a short time and so you don't look at that but then you look at the promise and say the promise is my possession praise the name of the Divine Promises of God the things that God has assured us those are the things that we possess and those are the things that should be in our mind with such a positive confession praise the name of our Lord the Bible telling us that Christ is the high priest of our confession so then what is your confession confession failure or your confession is Victory praise the name of the Lord your confession is that I am strong even when I'm full of weaknesses but I confess that I am strong praise the name of our Lord so then we need to have a True Confession and say Lord you died for me you took my place and here I am I surrender myself to you I commit myself unto you I call upon your name praise the name of a living now let us go to and read about here in Matthew Matthew 14 and then verse 24 the scripture says but the Sheep was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus spoke unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if be though B me come onto the on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying glor Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and called him and said unto him oh th of little faith where doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind seized this is a very interesting story they were afraid they were in troubles praise the name of our Lord to much storms and everything the way we were also in sin and then we hear the gospel and when we hear the gospel we were encouraged praise the name of our Lord and then Peter when he said Lord if it is you tell me to come walking on the water and then Jesus told come walk on the water praise the name of our Lord and we have also accepted him in our life we have invited him in our lives we have invited him at our homes but you see the devil being the devil he always brings storms in our families he always brings storms in our lives and now Peter was walking towards Christ he was obeying the word of God and then the devil brought a storm and that's what happens in our daily walk the devil can bring any storm at any time but what the devil is interested in is for you to look at the stor and take your eyes away from Jesus but Jesus was coming and Peter was going towards him and we also living in a time waiting for the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ coming so near he coming so soon but you see the storms the devil has raged this storm of financial need this stor of sickness this St of dis pressure here this storm of family trouble this stor at place of work this storm all over the Earth praise the name of our Lord bringing too many storms raging you know things that are you can't understand things that are beyond your praise the name of our Lord Peter would not stop the storm on his own but it was again but look at the storm because Jesus told him why did you doubt and this is what the devil is also doing to take our attention from Christ so that we can look at the Devil That's what Satan is doing you know that you take away your attention from the one who has called you and then you look at your stresses then you look at your weaknesses then you look at your failures and you lose Faith to overcome what you're going through and that's what Peter was going through he started looking at the storm and the devil always wants to Shield the presence of God the devil always wants us to think the Lord is away from us the devil always wants us to think God is Not on our side so that he takes you alone by the side and it can afflict you but don't allow to look at the storms of life don't allow look at your weaknesses don't allow to look at your failures look unto the Lord you have believed I said Lord here I am even when Peter failed he didn't just continue drowning but he called on the name of the Lord Lord Save Me Lord deliver me out of this wickness Lord deliver me out of this fail and that should always be our heart's desire Lord I'm looking upon you Lord I'm depending upon you not my ability not my strength but I'm looking looking at you who has called me praise the name of the Lord because says come unto me you are heav and I will give you rest praise the name of our Lord and there's a lot we can get from the Lord there's a lot that the Lord desires to do for us we should stop observing lying praise the name of the Lord now as I finish let us go to 2 chonicles 2 chonicles chapter 16 and then verse one and verse two 2 chonicles 16 verse 1 and verse rather verse 12 just beg you excuse and Assa in the thir and nth year of hisra was diseased in his feet until his dis disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not the Lord but to the Physicians he depended upon Physicians he depended upon the things he had abilities to Bible says he never depended upon the Lord he never sought the Lord but he sought the Physicians and sometimes that what theil wants us to do I have a lot of money can do for me this I have this can do for me this I have this can do for but the Lord wants us to seek Him Praise the name of the Lord when Hezekiah was sick he sought the Lord whena was seek despite seeking the Lord that should not be us in our weaknesses in all our infirmities seek the Lord praise the name of the Lord he came to take over all our INF the Bible has told us he is a high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities whatever weakness you have don't look at the weakness don't look at the failure but look at the one who has given the promise that I have come to take over all what you go through all your failures all your weaknesses your sickness your needs what you don't have praise the name of our everything Christ came to take over everything praise the name of our Lord so we just need to surrender to God and say Lord take over my weakness take over my failures deliver me from this kind of this is my need this is my desire you just call upon the name praise the name of our Lord don't look at your weaknesses when you look at your weaknesses you fail but look unto the Lord praise the name of our Lord in whatever St you going issue that has befen you just call upon the name of the Lord and just believe keep on trusting in Him keep on depending upon and then he will take you through that SP praise the name our Lord he took through Peter when he was drowning praise the name of the Lord and then the Bible says that our God praise the name of the Lord is a very present help in trouble praise the name of the Lord Psalms 46 and verse one God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore we will not fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea that the waters thereof roow and be troubled that the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Psalms 46:1 up to verse three 46 verse one praise the name of the Lord he says God is our refuge and strength are very present in trouble what kind of trouble he says is a very present praise the name you just need to believe that with all your heart and you don't look at the trouble but look to God said Lord come down in this trouble that Lord come down in this that I'm Lord come and deliver me I'm encompassed with a lot of weaknesses but yet I'm depending upon you like Jonah he was encompassed with you know vomit and weeds in the Bell the belly of the fish but he didn't look at his station he regarded his station as a lying and we should do the same thing regard your weaknesses you take your weaknesses as a lying vanity because there is a promise that the Lord has given unto us praise the name of the Lord that he has given us Victory and so you take that Victory you claim that Victory praise the name of our Lord and say Lord this is what I possess I'm not possessing the failures I have I'm not I'm not owning the failures I have I'm not owning the weaknesses that I have but I'm taking the promise of God praise the name of the Lord because he who has promised is faithful praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible says greater is he that is in US devil that's in the world greater is he that has promised us than the devil that's getting us into weaknesses praise the name of the Lord and then you possess that g of you take over that kind of weakness and then you come out when you are strong praise the name of the Lord may God bless you Amen Let us sing that song Let the weak say I am strong praise the name of the Lord give thanks to the Holy One give than to the mighty one give thanks because is given us Jesus Christ the son give than with th grateful heart give thanks to the Holy One give thanks because it's GI us Jesus Christ he son let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich
