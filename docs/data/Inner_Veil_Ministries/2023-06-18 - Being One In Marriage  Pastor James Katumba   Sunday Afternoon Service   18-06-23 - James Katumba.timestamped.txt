[12:40] Genesis chapter 2.
[12:46] verse 21 the Bible says
[12:50] and the Lord God caused deep sleep to
[12:53] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[12:56] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[12:59] instead thereof foreign
[13:10] which the Lord God had taken from man
[13:13] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[13:17] mind
[13:25] and Adam said this is now born of my
[13:28] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[13:31] called woman because she was taken out
[13:34] of man Adam
[13:47] they official a man leave his father and
[13:50] his mother and shall cleave unto his
[13:53] wife and they shall be one flesh almost
[14:00] yet
[14:04] may God blessing of his wife
[14:08] praise the name of our Lord sorry that
[14:12] we didn't end the meeting early enough
[14:14] of lunch break
[14:18] foreign
[15:08] The man shall leave his father and his
[15:10] mother
[15:13] and shall cleave unto his wife
[15:17] and then they shall be one flesh
[15:21] so now how do we become one
[15:26] you know marriage brings us into the
[15:28] union
[15:30] and then when we are married we need to
[15:34] maintain that Union in our marriage
[15:40] you know like I just like that scripture
[15:43] in the Malachi chapter 2.
[15:45] because
[15:57] unless maybe people have been forced to
[15:59] marry one another
[16:01] of course we see that in some cultures
[16:04] and some religions
[16:08] and even in some Churches you find that
[16:11] you know they say you go with this one
[16:12] or this one take you things like that is
[16:15] but then here is that when you are
[16:19] coming into marriage
[16:21] you find that even the covenants
[16:25] which you really pronounce
[16:28] or which you are sent to over you know
[16:32] you know they ask you do you have any
[16:36] impediments
[16:38] do you have any issue that why you
[16:40] should not be married
[16:42] you know so they give opportunity to the
[16:46] man and even to the woman
[16:48] so that if you are saying I'm not
[16:50] interested
[16:52] then you opt out
[16:56] so now but the Union
[17:01] or before but then you see the union of
[17:04] marriage
[17:05] people should get into it willingly
[17:10] and then you see how the Lord started it
[17:13] that God didn't take it from another
[17:17] body
[17:19] but God took him from Adam's Body
[17:23] And now when he took Eve from Adam's
[17:27] Body
[17:28] he's very rape
[17:31] then he brought the woman to the man
[17:52] I was very excited to be United with his
[17:56] wife
[17:57] and that is also the same thing when
[17:59] people married
[18:00] they are so much excited
[18:03] praise the name of Allah so much excited
[18:06] to move out
[18:08] until they live and close the programs
[18:11] of all other things
[18:13] so much excited to live together
[18:16] you know because there is a union that
[18:19] God has brought
[18:21] this and this is the same thing that God
[18:24] wants us to maintain in our marriage
[18:27] that Union that you had on the wedding
[18:30] day
[18:31] that love and feeling for one another
[18:34] you had on the wedding
[18:37] to maintain the same
[18:40] praise the name of it maybe on the
[18:43] wedding day maybe you could have had
[18:44] some doubts
[18:46] But as time goes on there is a trust you
[18:50] need to build for one another
[18:53] praise the name of Allah so God expects
[18:57] us
[19:02] and everything that we do praise the
[19:06] name of Allah as a husband and a wife we
[19:10] need to see that we make our marriage
[19:14] as being one in that marriage
[19:19] and the only way we can have our
[19:22] marriage workers
[19:24] if we need to have the mind of God
[19:29] you need to have the mind of God what is
[19:33] the mind of God concerning our marriage
[19:36] what is the purpose us of God concerning
[19:38] our years
[19:41] so now in the message the uncertain
[19:44] sound
[19:47] God is a holy God
[19:51] and when man is born of the Holy Spirit
[19:57] he's a candidate he's not only that but
[20:02] is a king
[20:03] he's a prince
[20:06] he's from another Nation
[20:09] his kingdom is above
[20:12] he's filled with God's power
[20:15] God is presence the woman does that puts
[20:21] on clothes the man lives
[20:25] and true to his wife the wife lives
[20:33] they want nothing of the world
[20:37] their affections are set on the things
[20:40] above
[20:42] they are finished with the things of the
[20:45] world
[20:46] they are new creatures in Christina
[20:56] not them or not them holy but the Holy
[21:00] Spirit govern them
[21:03] they don't have their own mind
[21:07] the holy spirit moves in there
[21:10] that's the reason they act crazy to the
[21:15] people of the world because they have
[21:18] moved by a spirit of another kingdom
[21:23] so when the spirit of God comes down in
[21:27] us
[21:27] it will change our mind
[21:30] walk upon our mind
[21:35] and you see it is very very important
[21:40] that you have God in you first
[21:44] then you get into marriage
[21:51] you know you need to get the spirit
[21:54] first
[21:56] woman get into the marriage
[21:59] praise the name of us and so even now in
[22:03] our marriages
[22:04] we need the spirit of God to rule in our
[22:09] Affairs
[22:11] we need the spirit
[22:13] you know to take cover for God praise
[22:16] the name of us the scripture says the
[22:19] head of the man is Christ
[22:24] but if the man doesn't have Christ
[22:28] then where is his head is
[22:34] foreign
[22:46] then you don't know what is going to
[22:48] happen in your home
[22:52] but you see in marriage the man has to
[22:56] have the head which is Christ
[22:59] if the man is without the head um
[23:05] so he will do whatever he wants to do
[23:08] praise the name of God and then the head
[23:12] of the woman is the man which is
[23:15] but now imagine a woman getting a man
[23:20] who is headless
[23:25] trouble visible but now we ourselors
[23:29] everything for being if we as husbands
[23:32] we have the head cries
[23:35] then you should be able to manage your
[23:38] Affairs at home
[23:41] you should be able to be patient with
[23:44] your wife
[23:45] you should be evil
[23:49] you know you you are you are able to
[23:52] know
[23:53] what exactly to do at that time
[23:59] now let us go to First Corinthians
[24:02] chapter 8.
[24:05] and then verse 9.
[24:22] becomes a stumbling block to them that
[24:25] are weak area
[24:33] for If any man see thee which has
[24:37] knowledge sit at meat
[24:41] on the idols Temple shall not be
[24:44] conscious of him which is weak be
[24:46] emblooded to eat those things which are
[24:49] offered to idols
[25:07] and through thy knowledge shall the weak
[25:10] brother perish for whom Christ died
[25:22] but when you've seen so against the
[25:24] brethren and wound there we conscious
[25:28] you sin against Christ
[25:38] um
[25:44] wherefore if meat make my brother to
[25:48] offend
[25:49] I will eat no flesh while the world
[25:53] standeth lest I make my brother to
[25:57] offenders
[26:07] so he's talking about eating and then
[26:11] when you eat something which offends
[26:13] another Warriors
[26:14] don't do it for the sake of your brother
[26:18] so even us now at our homes
[26:22] there are some things you may like what
[26:24] is open but they offend your husband or
[26:28] your wife
[26:31] now for the sake of being one in that
[26:34] marriage
[26:36] let go of the things that offend one
[26:39] another event
[26:46] take them off
[26:49] praise the name of Allah you love
[26:51] watching football until maybe three
[26:54] three a.m
[26:56] and your wife doesn't want it why would
[27:00] you insist on having that right
[27:03] praise the name of our Lord you like
[27:06] going maybe to clubs or whatever places
[27:09] or there are some of your friends and
[27:13] your wife is not comfortable with them
[27:15] why would you stick yourself to such
[27:17] people
[27:18] or maybe the same thing you'll find that
[27:22] in some areas
[27:25] the husband is complaining about the
[27:28] friends of the wife
[27:30] and the other woman has done this she
[27:33] broke the other horse
[27:37] you know you get here those kind of
[27:39] things if you find that your husband or
[27:42] wife is complaining about something you
[27:45] like doing it
[27:47] why do you continuously offend him while
[27:52] you continuously offend here
[27:56] or when you go to this place this thing
[27:58] happens
[28:04] when your spirit is dividing
[28:07] so this is what the Bible is
[28:15] so now we are looking now at our actions
[28:18] as husband and wife
[28:21] that
[28:23] are not pleasing to the others you know
[28:27] he's offended by this she is offended by
[28:30] this
[28:31] let it go and then have the peace why
[28:36] would you cleave to somebody not your
[28:38] wife or your husband
[28:42] to love to lose peace at your home
[28:47] so you need to let go of offensive
[28:50] things
[28:53] if there is something that is not
[28:56] pleasant to your wife
[28:58] get rid of it
[29:01] that is not pleasant to your husband get
[29:04] rid of it
[29:07] so you are so much considerate one to
[29:10] another
[29:11] queen
[29:13] see the Bible says let us be like-minded
[29:20] praise the name of us feeling for one
[29:24] another
[29:25] let us got Philippians chapter 2.
[29:31] foreign
[29:37] be there for any consolation in Christ
[29:41] if any comfort of love
[29:44] if any Fellowship of the spirit if any
[29:47] boils and masses
[29:50] foreign
[31:22] praise the name of our Lord
[31:24] the brother at home is quiet
[31:27] but when he goes to his place of work
[31:30] he's so talkative Allah then you start
[31:34] wondering what's Happening Here
[31:39] at a place of work is where he took
[31:42] everybody knows
[31:44] and everybody is just you know happy to
[31:48] have him around he's funny he makes a
[31:51] lot of jobs
[31:54] but now when he gets at his
[31:59] homework
[32:03] it shouldn't be like that
[32:06] instead of all of your best
[32:10] let your wife find it in you
[32:13] praise but then you will find it is so
[32:17] strange
[32:18] and then you can also find a woman
[32:24] [Music]
[32:29] I wish those are but when he gets home
[32:33] very rough concerned
[32:39] is the name of our Lord but all your
[32:41] goodness
[32:43] all the things that God has bestowed
[32:46] upon you
[32:47] should belong to your wife or to your
[32:50] husband
[32:52] if they are talking about Good
[32:54] characters
[32:56] let the husband rejoice in your good
[32:58] Courage
[32:59] the wife rejoicing your good character
[33:04] let us be like-minded
[33:08] praise the name of Allah and the Bible
[33:11] says having one account
[33:14] and of one mind
[33:17] let nothing be done through Strife of
[33:20] vain Glory
[33:23] but in loneliness of mine
[33:26] Let each estimate the other better than
[33:29] themselves
[33:33] make sure praise the name of Allah that
[33:37] when you meet one foreign
[34:03] no it shouldn't be like that and when
[34:06] you are meeting Wonder Don't Start With
[34:07] criticism
[34:09] Where Have You Been why have you delayed
[34:15] no it shouldn't be like that
[34:18] praise the name of our Lord let there be
[34:21] warms
[34:23] that somebody is always feeling good to
[34:26] come back feeling good to be around
[34:28] until it is difficult to live one
[34:31] another okay
[34:33] that's our home should be
[34:36] but not coming home I don't know when
[34:39] the night will end
[34:42] praise the name of our Lord not during
[34:45] the times of Corona obviously
[34:51] you know they are parents
[34:53] when the children are coming home they
[34:56] say we have traveled
[35:08] so they come back when the children are
[35:10] asleep
[35:12] or maybe wife
[35:16] but when Corona came I couldn't already
[35:19] die all people are forced to live
[35:20] together
[35:22] there were no televisions there were no
[35:25] clubs no drinking places
[35:35] we shouldn't wait for Corona to bring us
[35:36] together
[35:40] because we are family
[35:42] let us have joy to be together as a
[35:47] family let it be a joke
[35:51] for a husband sit together with the wife
[35:56] father and mother to sit with their
[35:58] children
[36:01] that's been a family that God should
[36:04] have
[36:05] praise the name of Allah so then the
[36:08] Bible says let nothing be done through
[36:11] Strife of vain Glory
[36:17] but in loneliness of mine
[36:21] the other better than themselves
[36:27] like maybe you may be in a position
[36:31] you know like sometimes a wife may be
[36:34] having a better job than the husband
[36:35] together
[36:38] but getting more money does not make you
[36:41] the head
[36:42] but you need to have that loneliness of
[36:45] mine
[36:48] praise the name of it like there is a
[36:51] scenario I know of yeah
[36:55] the husband lost her job lost his job
[37:01] and then now the wife was working
[37:04] but now what's the Mother-in-law of the
[37:08] husband did
[37:11] the mother of the wife
[37:14] would call the son-in-law and some
[37:19] sending you support what is it but don't
[37:22] tell your wife I'm done was given you I
[37:24] talk about it
[37:27] despise you you know she was so
[37:29] interested in a family
[37:32] praise the name of Allah and so we need
[37:35] to see that we avoid things of
[37:37] competition in a home
[37:46] let us be one-minded
[37:49] and giving support to one another
[37:53] praise the name of us and likewise if
[37:57] you were a husband I can remember
[37:58] brother Brandon when he was going to
[38:00] marry Hulk
[38:02] and then you know he was saying no
[38:04] open's father was very rich
[38:08] and then for him he would make just a
[38:11] small money a week
[38:13] but he said I'm committed to make sure
[38:16] that my hands
[38:19] Bruce Bruce to make sure that I take
[38:21] care of your daughter
[38:23] we will also be willing to work
[39:26] praise the name of
[39:37] foreign
[40:21] but there was when the son of these
[40:24] things
[40:27] they were going back to God
[40:31] intervened when I left home and then the
[40:36] Lord told him go and be obedient to your
[40:39] mistress
[40:42] when Abraham was heard about Sarah
[40:45] telling him that Chester with this is
[40:55] so we need to see that whatever troubles
[40:58] we have better government
[40:59] problems
[41:06] this is what we are going through praise
[41:09] the name of us you know there are many
[41:11] promises
[41:13] let us look at some of them
[41:16] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[41:19] Proverbs chapter 18 verse 22. give him
[41:25] praise the name of our Lord Proverbs 18
[41:28] 22.
[41:36] a wife findeth a good thing and obtains
[41:40] favor of the Lord
[41:48] so if you have found the wife if you
[41:52] have a wife
[41:55] you have
[41:56] four good things
[41:57] and the Bible says you have already
[42:00] obtained the favor of God
[42:03] promises
[42:05] praise the name of Allah but don't look
[42:07] what your wife as a cast
[42:10] oh I wish I didn't get hurt
[42:14] there's something wrong with you
[42:17] foreign
[42:42] take it as so special
[42:45] take care of him as very special
[42:51] even the children you have there are no
[42:54] better children their neighbors children
[42:57] are not the better children for you
[42:59] Neighbors
[43:04] praise the name of us so whatever God
[43:07] has given you in your household
[43:10] is the best
[43:13] thank you for my wife Lord I Thank you
[43:16] for my husband thank you for my children
[43:19] and then you will see the goodness that
[43:21] God has put in them
[43:24] if you don't appreciate it you don't see
[43:27] the good things
[43:29] you'll not see the favor
[43:32] the favor that God has given you
[43:35] praise the name of us but we need to
[43:38] learn how to appreciate it
[43:41] and say Lord I Thank you and then you
[43:45] see how you can work on one another's
[43:47] weakness
[43:51] all the weakness you think your husband
[43:54] has well enough foreign
[45:13] tell me but conscious of what they were
[45:15] doing
[45:16] she makes this day throw down because
[45:21] then they vomit they do everything
[45:24] and then she started singing but Jesus
[45:28] bear the cross alone yes he was not
[45:31] doing it with bitterness but she was
[45:33] doing it with love with the loneliness
[45:36] of mine no more windows and at the end
[45:40] of the day she won all of them to Christ
[45:44] the name of us and he said the Bible
[45:46] tells us you don't pay evil for evil
[45:52] do good but then you'll find some
[45:56] families if the husband doesn't do this
[45:58] the wife also will not do this
[46:05] handle your role according to the
[46:08] scriptures
[46:09] and then you'll be able to win
[46:12] the one that the Bible says that if you
[46:16] are married to somebody is another
[46:17] believer
[46:18] you sanctify him you as a man as a
[46:21] person is a Believer he will make reason
[46:24] so the more he looks at your life
[46:27] you are able to bring him to God
[46:31] praise the name of our Lord so don't
[46:34] think of another alternative husband or
[46:36] wife
[46:39] don't don't start saying I wish I'm the
[46:42] one who got married
[46:47] God has given you your husband God has
[46:50] given you away walk upon your life
[46:54] praise the name of it so the Bible says
[46:57] let us be like mine
[47:00] praise the name of Allah let us go to
[47:06] Romans chapter 15.
[47:10] praise the name of the Lord I have very
[47:13] few minutes left
[47:18] Romans chapter 15 and then verse 1.
[47:22] the Bible says we then that that from
[47:27] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[47:30] weak and not to please ourselves
[47:41] like maybe in your home
[47:43] either the wife is weak or the husband
[47:46] this week
[47:48] oh you find he has a lot of infirmities
[47:54] foreign
[48:39] for even Christ please not himself but
[48:42] as it is written the reproaches of them
[48:45] that reproached
[48:47] foreign
[49:32] learn to serve
[49:45] in this one's weakness let everyone feel
[49:49] the gap of the other when they are not
[49:51] around
[49:54] but when your wife is not around and you
[49:57] don't miss her
[49:59] there is a problem or when your husband
[50:02] is not around and you feel I'm so
[50:04] peaceful because it's not around
[50:08] those are problems
[50:14] but when you are one you feel you say oh
[50:17] I wish you would come back I wish I wish
[50:21] she was around
[50:23] praise the name of it and that's how we
[50:25] can raise our children
[50:27] when we are one as husband and wife
[50:31] and we give them such a good example
[50:34] foreign
[50:44] children as a husband and a wife
[50:47] together
[50:49] your children will be complete
[50:52] but if there is a problem at home
[50:56] you'll find that children have complexes
[51:01] maybe they don't have self-esteem at
[51:03] school or with friends
[51:07] the festival
[51:11] they are always afraid but yeah and this
[51:14] is also how we hand our children at
[51:16] school
[51:17] you know if you are going to tell your
[51:19] children you are foolish
[51:21] you are making them fools
[51:25] if you tell your children
[51:28] you are imparting those negative things
[51:32] but learn to appreciate your children
[51:36] even if they have been making many
[51:38] mistakes
[51:40] see something and say thank you for
[51:42] doing it
[51:43] to do this
[51:52] let us just learn to raise our family in
[51:55] the way of the Lord
[51:57] amen amen now let us go to Matthew
[52:00] chapter 19.
[52:04] Matthew chapter 19.
[52:09] and then read from verse 3 to verse 10.
[52:14] the Pharisees also came unto him
[52:16] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[52:19] lawful for a man to put out his wife for
[52:22] every cause
[52:23] of
[52:31] and he answered and said unto them have
[52:34] you not read that which made them at the
[52:37] beginning made them male and female
[52:42] is
[52:47] and say for this cause shall a man live
[52:50] father and mother and shall cleave to
[52:53] his wife and they trying shall be one
[52:55] flesh nagamba into a month
[53:03] wherefore they are no more trying but
[53:06] one flesh what they are for God has
[53:08] joined together let no man put asunder
[53:13] um
[53:16] and they say unto him why did Moses then
[53:20] command to give a writing of divorcement
[53:22] and to put her away
[53:30] he says unto them Moses because of the
[53:34] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[53:37] put away your wives but from the
[53:39] beginning it was not so much
[53:58] foreign now when you were married to
[54:01] Baba fumble we shouldn't have the
[54:03] hardness of heart between Alcove
[54:08] you don't want to hear when you're being
[54:10] corrected
[54:11] you don't want to consider the other
[54:14] one's opinion
[54:15] he was just stuck in your life
[54:19] [Music]
[54:26] because hardness of hearts
[54:30] Fatima praise the name of
[54:33] the name of bricks
[54:34] the other party chicosa oh it greets the
[54:39] other one with Spirits
[54:41] praise the name of our Lord but you know
[54:44] when you have you know a broken heart
[54:48] a contrite spirit
[54:51] and the God Scripture says I dwell with
[54:55] such people with the contrite and a
[54:57] broken
[54:58] hearted
[55:01] yourself
[55:06] be sincere to one another
[55:09] I'm very sorry for this
[55:12] has been listening to each other's
[55:15] opinions
[55:16] be able to bear with one another
[55:19] but not having the hardness of Hearts
[55:23] until you cannot reconcile okay
[55:27] until you don't consider what offends
[55:30] your wife or your husband
[55:33] [Music]
[55:34] foreign
[55:45] and then in verse 14.
[55:47] he says yet you see you say wherefore
[55:52] because the Lord has been witnessed
[55:55] between the and the wife of thy youth
[55:57] against whom though has to dealt
[56:00] treacherously yet she is thy companion
[56:03] and the wife of thy covenants
[56:18] he says
[56:34] and then in verse
[56:39] 7. he says likewise your husbands dwell
[56:44] with them according to knowledge giving
[56:47] honor unto the wife and as as unto the
[56:51] weaker vessel and being here as together
[56:53] of the grace of life that your prayers
[56:56] be not hindered
[57:03] um
[57:10] praise the name of Allah so in my life
[57:13] chapter 2 verse 14 he said you've dealt
[57:16] treacherously
[57:19] but then the issue we should be the
[57:24] solution to that is First Peter chapter
[57:26] 3 verse
[57:29] dwell with them according to knowledge
[57:35] you know there is a difference between
[57:37] dealing and dwelling
[57:43] foreign
[57:46] [Music]
[57:57] but when you have your chicken
[58:00] you dwell with the chicken
[58:03] you don't deal with the chicken
[58:05] so the Bible is telling us let us not
[58:09] deal with one another
[58:12] I'll deal with it like a class teacher
[58:16] telling a student a person to deal with
[58:19] you then you know what's going on
[58:21] together that should not be the way we
[58:25] deal with our wives
[58:28] it shouldn't be like that as a home but
[58:31] the Bible says dwell with them
[58:36] in other words you are pleased to live
[58:39] together
[58:43] pleased to be together
[58:46] praise the name of Allah so we need to
[58:49] see how we can continue being one in our
[58:51] marriage
