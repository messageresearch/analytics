[30:37] I was made in sacred and curiously wrote
[30:41] in the lowest parts of the Earth
[30:45] Thine Eyes did see my substance
[30:48] yet being unperfect
[30:51] and in thy book all my members were
[30:55] written
[30:56] which in continuance were fashioned when
[31:00] as yet
[31:06] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[31:10] being unperfect
[31:12] and in thy book all my members were
[31:16] written which in continuance were
[31:19] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[31:23] them amen amen
[31:27] a loving
[31:29] almighty God
[31:35] you wrote each promise of every day of
[31:39] my life
[31:41] in my soul
[31:44] when I was born
[31:47] now today
[31:55] we pray that the rain and the Sunshine
[31:59] of the message
[32:03] that it may come and water that seeds
[32:07] so that it can germinates
[32:11] it may build a body like yours Jesus

[32:31] and the rest shall be added down to you
[32:36] we are now seeking the kingdom of God
[32:41] we wish that by the end of this service
[32:45] may you multiply to us the Earthly
[32:49] things
[32:50] may you answer the needs
[32:54] May those who are sick receive the
[32:56] healing problems May every problem find
[33:00] the solution in the name of Jesus amen
[33:04] amen
[33:06] God bless you we may be seated
[33:14] we are beginning from the time when you
[33:18] are born
[33:19] yes
[33:22] as when we were born Jesus had already a
[33:25] program in our soul
[33:30] a program having all the promises for
[33:34] each and every day
[33:37] so you there is a promise pertaining
[33:40] today
[33:44] and also the rain and sunshine to cause
[33:48] the germination of the seed of the
[33:51] promise of this day
[33:54] now God promised it and planned it that
[33:57] it should come through my my mouth
[34:01] there is nothing that is happening just
[34:04] as a new thing
[34:08] you may you may be surprised to see me
[34:11] here today
[34:12] but to God is not even surprised
[34:18] it is something that he already planned
[34:20] before the foundation of the world
[34:24] that is the reason the Bible says
[34:29] that is in Romans chapter 10 verse 17
[34:35] that faith comes by hearing
[34:39] [Music]
[34:42] and by hearing the word from Christ
[34:49] [Music]
[34:50] the faith comes by hearing the word
[34:53] which comes from the mouth of the Lord
[34:56] Jesus Christ
[35:01] the spokesperson of Christ is the
[35:04] prophet
[35:12] that is the reason we believed the
[35:15] message of the prophets
[35:17] now brother Branham says
[35:20] that his message
[35:25] his message comes from Calvary siku yes
[35:31] that day when the Lord Jesus Christ said
[35:35] it is all finished
[35:40] that is the day that he allowed he
[35:43] allotted the message of each age
[35:51] he chose the mouthpiece that he will use
[35:55] to speak that message
[35:57] in each age
[36:00] that is in the New Testament
[36:05] now even our time today
[36:08] yesu there is a mouthpiece of Jesus
[36:13] which are supposed to give us words to
[36:16] give us the faith
[36:19] now that mouthpiece is is a William
[36:22] Marion Brown now and this is how he says
[36:27] Revelation let's read in the Book of

[37:16] so in Romans chapter 10 verse 17.
[37:29] so in the message revelation

[43:51] so that I may be able to repent
[43:55] when I repent
[43:57] the blood of Jesus
[44:00] it will come and a rest of that dot
[44:04] without repenting
[44:07] that seed will remain on the SIM cards
[44:12] I cannot be ruptured without repenting
[44:15] 6508-22m
[44:23] when you are born
[44:25] God sets a record on
[44:29] paragraph 64. it didn't make
[44:33] put a record on it don't make much noise
[44:37] for a little while you know that is the
[44:40] little baby till it comes to
[44:43] accountability then the noise starts he
[44:48] starts saying things and doing things he
[44:52] has to answer for
[44:55] and when that life ends yes
[45:00] now that SIM card of eternal life
[45:03] highways record
[45:08] it cannot begin recording when a child
[45:12] has not yet made seven years
[45:18] because at that age that child is not
[45:22] accountable for sin
[45:26] that child is just like Adam was before
[45:30] sin came in
[45:32] that's the reason when a young child
[45:35] dies
[45:36] before making the age of seven years
[45:40] that child will go to heaven because
[45:47] there is no city that was recorded
[45:50] against that child Amina come and sit
[45:54] come on Zambian
[46:13] that
[46:18] the roots of sin in you cannot allow the
[46:23] seed of eternal life to germinate okay
[46:25] Amina
[46:28] when you are born God sets a record on
[46:32] it don't make put a record on it don't
[46:36] make much noise for a little while you
[46:39] know that is the little baby till it
[46:42] comes to accountability
[46:45] then the noise starts he starts saying
[46:48] things and doing things he has to answer
[46:52] for and when that life ends the record
[46:57] or tape is took off and laid in the
[47:01] great big library of God now how are you
[47:06] going to get around it at the Judgment
[47:09] bar
[47:10] it is played right back in front of you
[47:14] every move you met
[47:16] every thought that went through your
[47:19] mind can you see that now you can see
[47:22] where God
[47:25] bless you so much
[47:28] that is to say that everything
[47:34] whether it is a good deed it is recorded
[47:38] when it is
[47:41] recorded
[47:45] now if you have a record of only evils
[47:50] those ones are the roots of Saturn uh
[47:56] foreign
[48:11] the invisible
[48:13] unionist of the bride of Christ
[48:17] 65 11 25.
[48:21] brother Branham says
[48:24] that when I'm preaching
[48:28] for you who are listening you are
[48:31] recording
[48:33] you are recording my preachings on your
[48:36] sim card we're gonna record them and God
[48:39] also is recording in heaven
[48:42] and his recording in my soul
[48:49] so it's not just this brother who is
[48:51] recording as I'm preaching
[48:54] record even the SIM card in me of
[48:58] eternal life is also recording
[49:01] even the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven is
[49:04] also recording
[49:08] remember
[49:09] there is a recording making of this
[49:14] not only on this step but God is great
[49:19] record each one of you
[49:22] every move when you bow your head you
[49:27] bow your heart what thoughts goes
[49:30] through your mind remember it is being
[49:33] recorded right now in glory and the
[49:38] record is going to be played on the day
[49:41] of judgment
[49:43] where is your decision oh how you will
[49:47] want it changed at that day
[49:50] now take a stand right now Leo today
[49:55] of repenting of your sins
[49:59] so that the roots of sin in you may be
[50:03] uprooted
[50:06] without uprooting the roots of sin you
[50:09] will not be raptured because
[50:14] with the roots of sin you are connected
[50:17] to Satan
[50:19] now brother
[50:21] brandonishi he says now I want to show
[50:24] you come back
[50:26] that whatsoever that has been recorded
[50:31] it is to make sure that whatever that
[50:34] has been recorded is the root of eternal
[50:37] life
[50:39] or if it is maybe the roots of Saturn
[50:45] that is how he came to make some two
[50:48] drawings of circles
[50:52] [Music]
[50:55] and then the first Circle that he drew
[50:58] on the board he said it was uh like the
[51:01] soul of someone who is sinful
[51:04] and then he made another Circle
[51:08] and that was that one he explained and
[51:11] said it is like the soul of someone who
[51:14] has received the holy spirit
[51:17] let us read 64.0802
[51:22] the future home of the Heavenly
[51:24] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[51:27] let me take this board just a minute
[51:30] I mean
[51:32] okay brother Branham draws illustration
[51:35] on the chalkboard now here is a human
[51:39] heart now I'm not I'm a long ways from
[51:45] being an artist
[51:47] here is a human heart and here is a
[51:50] human heart now this one over here has a
[51:55] snake in it that is the scene here he
[52:00] has his life
[52:01] the one over here has a dove in it which
[52:06] is the holy spirit here he has a life
[52:09] well this one here he has malice hatred
[52:15] envy that that is what is causing it is
[52:19] this fellow here well now we have that
[52:25] kind of those characters in US
[52:28] characters of of of of of of losing
[52:32] temper how is you cannot lose Temper
[52:39] Temper or anger is a seed
[52:45] it is like poison of a snake or what we
[52:48] call Venus
[52:50] Temper Temper that one is poison of the
[52:53] snake deception
[52:56] even telling lies that one is the poison
[52:59] of the snake
[53:03] that's that that lying lifestyle that
[53:07] one is is that poison of the snake how
[53:10] is it
[53:13] there is no way you are going to last
[53:16] after a woman who is not your wife
[53:23] has not injected in you with the Venom
[53:27] of adultery
[53:29] Neo it is that Venom akonda it is in you
[53:34] come on
[53:36] when he injects in you that poison of
[53:41] adultery
[53:43] and then it it enters in your blood
[53:46] and then it comes into your eyes
[53:51] now your eyes they love to last or look
[53:55] at women just a Bible that's the reason
[53:59] in Matthew chapter
[54:01] 27
[54:03] and 28. God says
[54:07] [Music]
[54:10] that he who looks at a woman and lasts
[54:14] after her
[54:17] that last thing it is the Venom of the
[54:21] snake amazing
[54:24] that person has already committed
[54:27] adultery with that woman
[54:48] that is just the fruit of the sin which
[54:51] that man is eating
[54:54] but he has already sinned
[54:57] in his Minds
[55:01] that is the reason
[55:03] a woman
[55:07] you are not just supposed to dress
[55:10] anyhowly
[55:13] you should recover your body very well
[55:17] because if you don't cover your body
[55:19] very well
[55:21] the Venom or poison of the snake in you
[55:26] it is like electricity
[55:49] so that poison is in the woman
[55:53] magnet it is just like a magnet now when
[55:57] I now you also
[56:01] now even though the man also has the
[56:04] seed of Saturn in him
[56:06] we are born with the two seeds
[56:10] we have the seed of eternal life and we
[56:14] also have the seed of the snake we have
[56:17] those two seeds now a woman
[56:24] he's going to push through the specs of
[56:27] the magnet of adultery
[56:29] how through the way she dresses
[56:33] or maybe the way she's walking
[56:38] you will find she's putting on the shoes
[56:41] the Socrates and then it's modeling like
[56:43] that
[56:45] so she's pushing those demons in you
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:11] [Music]
[57:22] for you to visit your brother
[57:25] and then your brother is not there at
[57:28] home
[57:30] and now the wife tells you that my
[57:33] husband is not around
[57:35] and then you say sister you first bring
[57:38] for me water hey
[57:40] I'm feeling a lot of thirsties you bring
[57:44] for me some water system
[57:48] but your brother is not there at home
[57:51] so now they give you the water you take
[57:55] the water
[57:56] now then you say let me rest a little
[57:59] while
[58:00] what are you surely looking for my
[58:02] brother
[58:03] um
[58:05] until when the sister Begins mingling
[58:08] the posture
[58:10] now if it happens that a maybe let's say
[58:13] a cup has dropped utang are you going to
[58:17] look at the sisters she's speaking
[58:20] that is why brother Branham
[58:25] he could not have a conversation with a
[58:28] lady
[58:30] unless that lady came with the husband
[58:34] because Jesus said Maria that to that
[58:38] Samaritan woman
[58:40] when Jesus told the Samaritan woman to
[58:42] give her to give him the water
[58:45] and then Jesus tells her before giving
[58:47] me the word
[58:49] you come with your husband
[58:52] God bless you so much
[59:06] now one of in one of these people one
[59:10] one Soul has the Holy Spirit another one
[59:13] is full of the snake now
[59:17] when you are asked all you are forgiven
[59:21] of your sins
[59:22] you are you have only done this second
[59:27] when you are baptized
[59:36] the serpent that snake is still in your
[59:40] soul
[59:43] you are just repenting of the fruits of
[59:46] the scene
[59:49] but now the roots of that of those
[59:52] things is still there in your soul Amina
[59:57] but the thing that made you do it is
[1:00:01] still there that is the all the root of
[1:00:04] evil
[1:00:05] it is
[1:00:10] that all root of Saturn is
[1:00:15] which was making you to commit the evil
[1:00:18] things notice
[1:00:24] Amina now when you are asked or you are
[1:00:27] forgiven of your sins you have only done
[1:00:30] this taken away that but the thing that
[1:00:34] made you do it is still there that is
[1:00:38] the old root of evil it is still there
[1:00:43] notice then you repent and you are
[1:00:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] that he forgive you of your sins notice
[1:00:53] then secondly he comes sanctification
[1:00:58] which sets our mind in order for
[1:01:02] Holiness to think right taken away
[1:01:07] sanctification is a compounded Greek
[1:01:11] word which means cleaned and set aside
[1:01:15] for service
[1:01:19] that is cleaning the roots of sin
[1:01:24] then the next comes the baptism of the
[1:01:29] fire and the holy ghosts
[1:01:35] now the fire of eternal life
[1:01:40] must come and burn the roots of sins
[1:01:44] after burning the roots of sage
[1:01:47] is when the Holy Spirit can come and
[1:01:51] dwell in you later that is what will
[1:01:54] happen
[1:01:56] when that one happens then we shall have
[1:01:59] the Rapture
[1:02:01] then we shall have the wedding supper of
[1:02:05] the Bride yes then we shall come here
[1:02:08] with Christ
[1:02:12] so that he may take on the Dominion or
[1:02:15] rulership of David
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:17] that he may be the son of David
[1:02:21] we shall come here with him to take one
[1:02:33] that fire will be burned that the aspect
[1:02:37] of time
[1:02:40] it will burn the aspect of time
[1:02:44] now Saturn with his demons they hide in
[1:02:48] the aspect of time to touch so we shall
[1:02:51] burn the issue of times
[1:02:54] that is how it is with the baptism of
[1:02:57] fires
[1:02:58] because first of all
[1:03:02] the world was at first baptized
[1:03:06] during the time of the floods of Noah
[1:03:10] that is how it is the same as the
[1:03:13] baptism
[1:03:14] this world here was baptized
[1:03:18] it was then baptized with the fire
[1:03:24] will then be baptized with the fire the
[1:03:27] day since you were Prince
[1:03:31] the day when with the prince and the
[1:03:34] princess of the king of kings
[1:03:38] after the wedding supper of the Bride
[1:03:41] now we shall descend here with fire
[1:03:45] and then we shall baptize this
[1:03:49] first of all he cuts down the trees
[1:03:54] that is just like the baptism of water
[1:03:59] so this this this Farm which is the
[1:04:02] world is supposed to be baptized with
[1:04:04] the fire attack now he's going to Amina
[1:04:08] so after the farmer clearing the
[1:04:09] vegetation then he burns now after
[1:04:13] burning with the fire attack
[1:04:16] now he's going to say okay the the maze
[1:04:22] that planting and the German is only
[1:04:25] after clearing the farm with fire Jose
[1:04:28] that is the reason
[1:04:32] on the day of pentecosts
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:38] that is Acts chapter 2 from verse one to
[1:04:42] five
[1:04:43] let's read it
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:46] foreign
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:04:58] was fully calm
[1:05:02] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:05:06] place
[1:05:08] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:05:12] Heaven as of a rushing might wind
[1:05:17] fire came down
[1:05:28] and suddenly there came
[1:05:31] a sound from Heaven as of a rushing my
[1:05:34] twin and it filled all the house where
[1:05:39] they were sitting
[1:05:42] 20
[1:05:43] and there appeared unto them clothing
[1:05:47] tanks like as on fire and it is sat upon
[1:05:52] each of them
[1:06:01] in which we shall descend with Jesus as
[1:06:05] The Offspring of David
[1:06:10] to ban the aspect of time where demons
[1:06:13] and Saturn hides
[1:06:17] that is the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:06:20] should come in use
[1:06:22] as it was on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:27] to burn all the roots on the day of
[1:06:30] Pentecost
[1:06:32] to burn all the roots of sin in you so
[1:06:36] that you may receive the Holy Spirit
[1:06:43] then the next
[1:06:46] comes the baptism of the fire e and the
[1:06:50] holy ghost that God might dwell in US
[1:06:54] and the fire of God
[1:06:57] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[1:07:02] the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:07:04] then we bring forth the same life
[1:07:08] that this did because that is in US
[1:07:14] Ezekiel let's read in Ezekiel
[1:07:19] now this this court here is in the Book
[1:07:23] of Ezekiel process
[1:07:25] the whole process is in the Book of
[1:07:29] Ezekiel
[1:07:30] that is chapter 36
[1:07:33] verse 25
[1:07:35] let us read it
[1:07:39] Ezekiel chapter 36 25 okay then we lie
[1:07:45] sprinkle clean water upon you
[1:07:48] and you shall be clean
[1:07:51] now that is the baptism of water when
[1:07:54] they from from all your filthiness and
[1:07:59] from all your Idols will I cleanse you
[1:08:04] a new heart also will I give you and a
[1:08:08] new spirit will I put within you and I
[1:08:12] will take away the Stony heart of Amina
[1:08:16] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:08:19] of your flesh
[1:08:22] he's going to give you a new spirit
[1:08:26] after the after the water baptism
[1:08:29] that a new spirit
[1:08:32] it is
[1:08:36] the dove which descended that day when
[1:08:39] Jesus was baptized
[1:08:42] so it took our lord Jesus in Into the
[1:08:46] Wilderness
[1:08:49] that is the very one that is being
[1:08:52] quoted here
[1:08:53] and new Spirits
[1:08:57] which will take you Into the Wilderness
[1:09:02] that is some new spirit took the
[1:09:05] apostles into the upper room
[1:09:10] Dr Jesus there is where you find Dr
[1:09:14] Jesus
[1:09:15] foreign
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:10:18] it is inside the hearts
[1:10:25] it has four chambers
[1:10:28] they are small they are small Chambers
[1:10:31] the ones we call the Oregon
[1:10:33] then we have some two big Chambers the
[1:10:36] one we call the ventricles
[1:10:40] in the middle of these two small
[1:10:42] Chambers
[1:10:45] there is a small vacuum when it's
[1:10:50] now that small vacuum is called bottle
[1:10:54] if you happen to check on the internet
[1:10:58] now in that small vacuum which is called
[1:11:01] the body
[1:11:04] before a child is born
[1:11:09] the blood of the mother is circulating
[1:11:12] in the young kids
[1:11:18] it circulates from the light from the
[1:11:20] left to the right
[1:11:23] to nourish the child with nutrients
[1:11:26] now the child eats
[1:11:29] from the food which the mother acts
[1:11:33] so it is assimilated in the blood of the
[1:11:36] child
[1:11:37] through that small vacuum of police so
[1:11:41] then it feeds it Amina it now feeds the
[1:11:45] body of the child
[1:11:48] now the food the digested food of the
[1:11:52] mouth
[1:11:54] it is that they are nutrients which give
[1:11:58] life that is subject to death
[1:12:01] now as the mother is eating
[1:12:04] maybe she's eating the fish
[1:12:08] because it is the foods of Life subject
[1:12:13] to death
[1:12:15] first of all the fish itself Must Die
[1:12:19] Kisha kuffa after the fish
[1:12:31] after roasting or frying that fish when
[1:12:36] that fish is already dead
[1:12:42] he's going to bite the fish and chew it
[1:12:45] in effect so that it should surely die
[1:12:51] and then it moves to the stomach of the
[1:12:54] mother who called chloric acid there is
[1:12:57] hydrochloric acid in your stomach
[1:12:59] so it continues burning that seed more
[1:13:04] today
[1:13:06] at the end of it we have very small
[1:13:09] particles of nutrients to feed the body
[1:13:11] of the child God bless you so much
[1:13:14] now when a child is born
[1:13:18] in that small vacuum which we are
[1:13:21] calling
[1:13:25] that is where the soul dwells now
[1:13:30] the soul is a part of God
[1:13:41] so it is coming to sit in that small
[1:13:44] Hall which we are calling bottle mama
[1:13:48] so when the mother is giving birth
[1:13:50] pushing the body out
[1:13:56] now God is also pushing the soul into
[1:13:59] the heart
[1:14:02] that's the reason why it is really very
[1:14:04] hard to just push out we immediately the
[1:14:08] child is out
[1:14:10] and then the Soul enters in the heart
[1:14:13] then the child can cry yeah yeah
[1:14:24] now it is going to live the hearts then
[1:14:28] you die
[1:14:30] then people say oh he's dying because
[1:14:35] the soul is getting out of the heart God
[1:14:39] bless you so much
[1:14:40] now that's soul
[1:14:42] brother
[1:14:45] it is in that small hole in your heart
[1:14:49] now let's read the message
[1:14:55] um
[1:14:56] the United the unity of one God in the
[1:15:01] one Church
[1:15:02] 58 12 21 8 64.
[1:15:08] there is a little room
[1:15:12] there is a little room
[1:15:15] a little place
[1:15:17] where there is not even a cell
[1:15:20] a little compartment in the human hearts
[1:15:25] it isn't in the animal
[1:15:27] or no other life
[1:15:33] these other animals do not they do not
[1:15:36] have a soul
[1:15:39] that's the reason we can slaughter them
[1:15:42] and we eat the meat
[1:15:45] Uganda I mean I mean
[1:15:48] I'm told some animals are not allowed to
[1:15:51] be floated in Uganda because
[1:15:54] it is
[1:15:57] we should respect the law of the land
[1:16:00] but
[1:16:03] we can really Slaughter that animal and
[1:16:06] then
[1:16:07] because the animal does not have a soul
[1:16:12] but we cannot eat the meat of a human
[1:16:15] being
[1:16:17] because a human being
[1:16:20] now that soul is a part of God
[1:16:26] in Congo there are some carnivore people
[1:16:29] who eat you
[1:16:32] that is a terrible scene Amina 20
[1:16:37] but in the human hearts there is a
[1:16:41] little place
[1:16:42] and they are never could come to
[1:16:45] conclusion
[1:16:46] what it was but finally they said it is
[1:16:51] the place where the soul dwells
[1:16:54] you see that little part compartment in
[1:16:58] a man's heart God made that in there for
[1:17:04] himself
[1:17:08] that is his control room he sets there
[1:17:13] to control you ah Amina now
[1:17:17] the soul is where God dwells
[1:17:23] that is that is why the sin of eternal
[1:17:26] life is in the soul now
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] that sin of eternal life is God himself
[1:17:34] that is where he comes
[1:17:37] and then he he builds that place Daniel
[1:17:41] row inside your your heart
[1:17:46] so that he may come by himself and dwell
[1:17:49] in that soul
[1:17:52] that is the what we call baptism of the
[1:17:55] Holy Spirit
[1:17:56] it is God himself coming to dwell in
[1:17:59] your soul
[1:18:04] that's all
[1:18:07] right
[1:18:10] God puts that soul in the heart the day
[1:18:14] when you are born
[1:18:15] twenty
[1:18:18] control control room that is his control
[1:18:22] room
[1:18:24] he sets there to control you ah that is
[1:18:28] his place
[1:18:30] that is where he sends his messages from
[1:18:34] the control room
[1:18:37] the message
[1:18:40] control room God sends his messages in
[1:18:44] the control room
[1:18:46] not in your head
[1:18:51] going to school and technology
[1:18:55] that maybe you are going to school or
[1:18:58] studying to know God
[1:19:02] the School of Theology you just started
[1:19:05] when you wake up when you wake up
[1:19:08] Amina that soul is asleep
[1:19:12] now how are you going to meet God
[1:19:15] that is the reason
[1:19:18] those prayers at night
[1:19:21] they are really very important when you
[1:19:25] at night
[1:19:28] that is the time when
[1:20:01] so the body becomes tired
[1:20:06] why is the body getting tired because
[1:20:09] life has left the body
[1:20:11] now even if the ears are wide open
[1:20:14] they are no longer hearing anything
[1:20:17] because
[1:20:18] the life has left the body
[1:20:21] even if you are still focusing with your
[1:20:24] eyes
[1:20:25] you are no longer seeing anything
[1:20:29] I remember one time I was with my wife
[1:20:35] she was briefing me about our son who
[1:20:39] was really rebellious
[1:20:42] then she was explaining now when the
[1:20:44] child the child reached there and did
[1:20:46] this
[1:20:47] now for me I began I began I began kind
[1:20:51] of
[1:20:52] Amina I was dozing so I was telling her
[1:20:55] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:20:58] then she continued saying understand did
[1:21:01] this no then me I was saying yeah
[1:21:06] my husband are you really listening to
[1:21:08] me
[1:21:09] you're already sleeping
[1:21:14] I'm just you are listening
[1:21:18] then she tasked me my husband what have
[1:21:21] I said
[1:21:23] football in India
[1:21:27] I said I I heard you saying
[1:21:30] when someone is scoring
[1:21:34] I was now telling my wife us about the
[1:21:37] dreams
[1:21:38] then she said you see my husband you
[1:21:41] were not hearing
[1:21:43] I said my wife
[1:21:48] this is because when you are sleeping
[1:21:53] the five senses
[1:21:56] they are no longer working
[1:22:02] all the five senses are inactive by that
[1:22:05] time
[1:22:10] I mean now they're super sense
[1:22:14] it is the one that is working by that
[1:22:17] time
[1:22:18] that is the reason mystery when they
[1:22:21] came from Egypt
[1:22:24] it was at me nights
[1:22:28] it was Amina it was at 2 am at night
[1:22:33] that is the time when God came down
[1:22:40] that was the time when the faith of
[1:22:43] Moses would work
[1:22:46] the faith of Moses
[1:22:49] that is the faith which pulled God down
[1:22:53] and then he came down
[1:22:56] Musa because of the soul of Moses
[1:23:00] then God himself began doing his works
[1:23:04] then he began fighting in Egypt now even
[1:23:09] away
[1:23:10] Google uh
[1:23:15] we should also learn from that or
[1:23:18] emulate
[1:23:21] we should also emulate or learn from the
[1:23:24] way Moses
[1:23:27] to invite God himself into our souls
[1:23:31] and then God May fight our battles God
[1:23:36] bless you so much
[1:23:37] George Washington that was done by
[1:23:40] George Washington
[1:23:42] Amina he used the soul
[1:23:48] Amina there were enemies the other side
[1:23:51] of Delaware now
[1:23:53] for them they were these other side
[1:23:57] then he prayed to God throughout the
[1:24:01] night
[1:24:04] so God came down in that just like he
[1:24:08] came down on the register
[1:24:10] and then he took his soul
[1:24:13] the life I can feature Daniel Crystal so
[1:24:17] he hid that life in Christ
[1:24:20] all in the morning when the battle
[1:24:23] started
[1:24:24] they shot John Washington are around
[1:24:28] three bullets
[1:24:30] even the bullets went through the court
[1:24:33] that he was putting
[1:24:36] the bullet horse decide three of them
[1:24:39] decide three of them the other side
[1:24:42] but when they looked at his body it was
[1:24:45] not touched by the bullets
[1:24:58] for them to kill to kill him they fasted
[1:25:02] to kill the life in him but he no longer
[1:25:04] had life in his body God bless you so
[1:25:08] much
[1:25:11] even one bullet went through Escape it
[1:25:14] went through this side and came from the
[1:25:16] other side
[1:25:18] when he removed
[1:25:22] if you look at his head there was
[1:25:24] nothing like a bullet
[1:25:27] that if that one real that thing for
[1:25:30] real it happened even it also happened
[1:25:34] it also happened with Daniel Daniel
[1:25:38] was casting The Den of Lions
[1:25:42] but he was covered
[1:25:45] he was covered
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:14] let us seek for baptism of the holy
[1:26:16] spirit
[1:26:18] so that we may begin using the pillar of
[1:26:21] Fire
[1:26:22] And by you receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:26:26] first of all you must approach the roots
[1:26:29] of sin
[1:26:32] the only room of control
[1:26:34] urisema
[1:26:36] uh
[1:26:39] paragraph 71
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:42] um
[1:26:48] ezima
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:54] Sabina moja
[1:26:56] you see
[1:26:58] that little part
[1:27:00] compartments in a man's heart
[1:27:03] Daniels God made that in there for
[1:27:07] himself
[1:27:09] that is his control room he sits there
[1:27:12] to control you
[1:27:15] that is his place
[1:27:17] your control now that control room
[1:27:24] it begins controlling the desire for sin
[1:27:29] when a preacher says
[1:27:34] that's a you sisters don't just address
[1:27:37] anyhowly in ability
[1:27:40] control room that those words must first
[1:27:43] of all enter into the control room
[1:27:46] when it enters when those words
[1:27:51] the lady will begin respecting herself
[1:27:56] but to be Father's words enter into the
[1:27:59] controls
[1:28:03] the woman will hear those the sister
[1:28:06] will hear those words as if it is just
[1:28:08] noise that the pastor is making for her
[1:28:11] these issues of taking warrants
[1:28:16] the word of God is supposed to enter
[1:28:19] into your control room
[1:28:21] if the word has not entered in the
[1:28:24] control room
[1:28:26] you will begin taking words
[1:28:33] because the word of God has not yet
[1:28:36] entered in the control room you are
[1:28:38] doing the evils in secrecy
[1:28:41] but when you accept your controlling
[1:28:46] that you may be under the control of the
[1:28:49] word of God
[1:28:52] now that word of God builds a body of
[1:28:56] eternal life
[1:29:01] it is
[1:29:06] supposed to build up the body of God
[1:29:25] um
[1:29:31] okay so my young
[1:29:38] Billy
[1:29:41] how can we work with you
[1:29:46] how can he work with you
[1:29:48] when the nature of the spirit of the
[1:29:52] devil is in there
[1:29:57] if you still have the roots of sin in
[1:30:01] you God cannot use you when they may not
[1:30:06] and every man born on Earth is born in
[1:30:10] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:30:14] speaking Lies
[1:30:18] We are born with the roots of sin in us
[1:30:23] so in that Kano academic nature how can
[1:30:29] a man achieve anything only by through
[1:30:33] his intellectuals
[1:30:35] but when he comes to be a new creature
[1:30:38] and the old man has passed out and the
[1:30:42] new man Christ takes his throne in the
[1:30:45] human heart
[1:30:47] then life looks different he starts on a
[1:30:52] new Road
[1:30:53] from his own selfish motives till the
[1:30:57] big ideas to make himself something big
[1:31:00] he starts right towards Calvary to
[1:31:04] recognize God
[1:31:06] then is all his objectives his motive
[1:31:11] his achievement and all that he is lays
[1:31:16] in the glory of the Cross where Christ
[1:31:19] paid the price for human life
[1:31:22] Christ is our life
[1:31:32] let's repeat these words faith comes by
[1:31:36] hearing
[1:31:38] electricity
[1:31:40] it is like the electricity of eternal
[1:31:43] life
[1:31:45] when it enters through the years
[1:31:51] is part of the five senses
[1:31:55] so it should descend up to inside the
[1:31:58] soul EJ so that it comes
[1:32:03] and then it makes the seed of eternal
[1:32:06] life to germinate
[1:32:11] now for that seed of eternal life to
[1:32:14] germinate the roots of eternal life must
[1:32:17] be uprooted
[1:32:18] when I'm preaching
[1:32:22] my voice proceeds foreign
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:35] it
[1:33:14] goes to the dwelling place of God
[1:33:18] where you have your apartment or room
[1:33:22] there now
[1:33:25] when your soul enters in your room
[1:33:29] that is that is where your soul receives
[1:33:33] that word from kupiteria telephone
[1:33:35] through the telephone
[1:33:38] now your soul
[1:33:41] it hears from there is now when it
[1:33:46] brings to you this message
[1:33:49] inside your soul
[1:33:52] now is it is there that's the soul
[1:33:56] that is where the soul of the Samaritan
[1:34:00] when that Soul received the message
[1:34:04] she left whatsoever she was doing
[1:34:07] she left it a kind of thing so she first
[1:34:11] went to put right her life now
[1:34:14] that is how it should be even with you
[1:34:18] let
[1:35:02] now before going to that person first
[1:35:04] come here Mimi me myself
[1:35:11] come here and speak it to God and tell
[1:35:15] him I have some differences or enemies
[1:35:18] with my neighbor
[1:35:21] now I want to go and meet my neighbor
[1:35:26] so that I may put right my life
[1:35:30] and now you will really speak it
[1:35:34] maybe you will tell the pastor pastor
[1:35:37] nakanisa and maybe you will also tell
[1:35:39] the church
[1:35:41] for me the brother or sister that you
[1:35:44] are seeing here I am not really good
[1:35:48] there are some people we don't
[1:35:50] communicate with them may you church
[1:35:54] pray for me so that I go and put right
[1:35:57] the life
[1:35:59] some of us here
[1:36:02] they just commit adultery fornication
[1:36:06] so today let it be the last day
[1:36:10] you come here at the altar and repent
[1:36:13] yes
[1:36:15] so that Jesus may approach that root of
[1:36:19] of sin
[1:36:21] when you leave your seats
[1:36:26] as you are moving approach
[1:36:29] as you are heading to the palpit
[1:36:32] God in heaven stands
[1:36:40] like the way he stood the day when they
[1:36:43] took this baby Moses into River Nile
[1:36:47] when his father
[1:36:50] when he reached near the Waters of river
[1:36:53] Niles
[1:36:55] then he begins praying
[1:36:59] before dumping the child into the water
[1:37:02] God is stood in Heavens
[1:37:05] and then he ordered all the angels
[1:37:10] look down there on Earth
[1:37:14] there is a person who is believing in me
[1:37:19] he wants to leave his child his son in
[1:37:22] the water
[1:37:23] go and look after
[1:37:26] Himachal we cannot live that child
[1:37:29] protected without protecting that child
[1:37:33] Gabrielle Gabriel Pikachu can you sound
[1:37:37] the trumpet
[1:37:40] gather Ten Thousand Angels
[1:37:44] Ten Thousand Angels
[1:37:48] when you leave your seat come into the
[1:37:51] altar to repent
[1:37:52] God stands up and
[1:37:56] he gathers Ten Thousand Angels
[1:37:59] so that they can escort you and God says
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:39:05] so that
[1:39:22] even more
[1:39:26] he also prayed that kind of prayers
[1:39:30] and he sent the angel of God Malaika
[1:39:34] elfukumi Ten Thousand Angels
[1:39:38] and then they filled the the soul of
[1:39:42] king ahasweras
[1:39:44] so even the King was troubled the whole
[1:39:48] night
[1:39:59] so that I may give him blessings God
[1:40:02] bless you so much
[1:40:05] that is the same way me
[1:40:09] your brother
[1:40:12] experiments

[1:40:21] I did not have a job at one time

[1:40:33] so I got that inspiration of repenting
[1:40:37] of my sins
[1:40:41] I was a thief was stealing the tight

[1:41:32] that is just the beginning
[1:41:34] after you selling the fish

[1:49:35] if it is about tomorrow then God you are
[1:49:39] not my father
[1:49:41] I've already fulfilled
[1:49:44] the way the message says I've already
[1:49:48] I've already kept
[1:49:50] I've repented
[1:49:53] now you give me a token 7 Ezekiel just
[1:49:57] like it was with with Hezekiah Leo today
[1:50:01] so after that
[1:50:17] then it was 10 a.m in the morning
[1:50:21] journalist one of my friends was a
[1:50:24] journalist akanita he called me as a
[1:50:27] professor mugalu and he said Professor
[1:50:30] mugaluapi where are you waziri wakongo
[1:50:35] communication
[1:50:36] the minister in charge of communication
[1:50:40] in Congo is looking for you
[1:50:42] ah forever I wasn't excited I said
[1:50:48] God
[1:50:51] God I never told you that the minister
[1:50:54] should look for me
[1:50:56] I said the President should look for me
[1:51:00] now how does the president become again
[1:51:03] the minister foreign
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:52:12] yes the president is looking for him
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:20] [Music]
[1:53:12] they are now two weeks when I was
[1:53:14] looking for you
[1:53:16] so I really am now happy to see you guys
[1:53:20] I want to give you a job
[1:53:23] I want to give you a job
[1:53:28] now that job I only give it to someone
[1:53:32] whom I really trust me
[1:53:35] Tanzania and that one is the ambassador
[1:53:38] of Congo in Tanzania
[1:53:41] so I remained in a shock
[1:53:45] I will ask myself am I dreaming or it is
[1:53:55] a true I prayed to God
[1:54:00] I don't think something like this can
[1:54:02] happen for my sake
[1:54:05] then the president asked me are you
[1:54:07] refusing the job
[1:54:10] how much money do you want I may give
[1:54:13] you so that you accept the job
[1:54:16] I said no Mr President
[1:54:18] I'm just wondering
[1:54:21] how you've come to give me that job not
[1:54:25] really
[1:54:28] I will really get my salary from that
[1:54:32] job okay now
[1:54:36] I'm appointing you as the Ambassador
[1:54:39] today and now
[1:54:41] just exactly the way
[1:54:46] those are the very words that were
[1:54:48] coming from his mouth
[1:54:52] is there some witchcraft which is above
[1:54:55] that one
[1:54:57] do we have some witchcraft which is
[1:54:59] above that one one
[1:55:02] that is for the men the message of the
[1:55:06] message
[1:55:09] he know he was no longer settled in his
[1:55:12] cities
[1:55:14] he was again calling the
[1:55:34] I'm not going to go with some files
[1:55:37] so he appointed me
[1:55:41] without even asking how did I style up
[1:55:45] with you and Elizabeth without even
[1:55:46] knowing where was I born yesterday
[1:55:50] but Jesus knew all of that Amina
[1:55:54] I was appointed Joseph
[1:55:57] that is the reason right now I'm a
[1:56:01] retired Ambassador
[1:56:03] that is the message
[1:56:22] I will add them to you
[1:56:29] that is to say that God he told us the
[1:56:35] day when you were born
[1:56:37] he put a SIM card
[1:56:40] in your soul your sim card that SIM card
[1:56:43] your control room that is the control
[1:56:46] room
[1:56:47] your work as as a person
[1:56:51] is to just approach the roots of sin um
[1:56:57] by approaching the roots of sin in
[1:57:00] ability
[1:57:04] Prophet the message must come from the
[1:57:07] mouth of the prophets
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:11] now for me when I come here I'll just
[1:57:14] replay repeat that message
[1:57:17] so that the message where
[1:57:27] that message may go to where the voice
[1:57:30] of God that brings faith is
[1:57:33] now it will come from charcoal into your
[1:57:37] your room
[1:57:40] then it is going to push it into your
[1:57:43] soul
[1:57:45] that is the reason
[1:57:50] in the next message he says
[1:57:56] that all the prophets
[1:57:59] all the prophets
[1:58:03] and even the preachers of the New
[1:58:07] Testament are prophets
[1:58:10] all the prophets
[1:58:12] and all the preachers
[1:58:16] what you are going to preach you look
[1:58:19] for it from heaven
[1:58:23] let it come from
[1:58:25] then it entered uh
[1:58:30] the impersonation of Christianity
[1:58:36] impersonation of Christianity
[1:58:40] foreign
[1:58:45] the impersonation of Christianity
[1:58:48] then
[1:58:50] the word that God has spoken before the
[1:58:55] foundation of the world
[1:58:57] that is the word that I'm preaching
[1:59:02] it's not just it should not supposed to
[1:59:04] be just the word that we are just
[1:59:06] speaking from here
[1:59:09] it is the exact word that God was to
[1:59:13] speak
[1:59:15] the one that he spoke before we were
[1:59:17] born
[1:59:19] and now according to his program it was
[1:59:23] for this day
[1:59:24] that is the word
[1:59:26] that I'm supposed to preach to you so
[1:59:29] Soma then
[1:59:31] the word that God has spoken before the
[1:59:35] foundation of the world
[1:59:37] it isn't that God speaks and says
[1:59:40] something to the prophet at that time it
[1:59:44] is that the prophet catches what God has
[1:59:47] already said for the word was before the
[1:59:52] foundation of the world he God spoke the
[1:59:55] word and it is laying way out so
[1:59:59] stretched out in time and the prophet
[2:00:03] goes up and sees the time coming
[2:00:10] the prophet goes up another and then he
[2:00:14] goes to see the world
[2:00:16] the word of our time then he comes down
[2:00:21] and then he preaches it
[2:00:24] then it he sends it to us
[2:00:29] don't you ever accept
[2:00:33] some brethren in this message
[2:00:38] then for them they say I think brother
[2:00:41] Branham made an error somewhere
[2:00:44] to me those people their network has
[2:00:48] some problems
[2:00:49] they for surely don't know what is the
[2:00:52] message
[2:00:55] the message it is brother Brandon I'm
[2:00:58] going up in heaven
[2:01:04] the way God had already spoken it
[2:01:07] that is what we call the message
[2:01:11] it is just like Moses Musa Moses
[2:01:16] he just wrote the way God created him
[2:01:22] by then what Moses was writing Moses
[2:01:26] wasn't there
[2:01:28] Moses was not there the day when God was
[2:01:32] created but he is explaining
[2:01:36] he says on the first day God did this
[2:01:39] because
[2:01:40] it is because he went up
[2:01:43] just like our prophets
[2:01:47] he even went up to the day
[2:01:51] and even saw how God was created then he
[2:01:55] began writing it God bless you so much
[2:02:09] that message had already been he had
[2:02:13] been spoken before the foundation of the
[2:02:15] world
[2:02:18] he went into the Wilderness
[2:02:21] he even rented a room for three full
[2:02:25] years
[2:02:26] that was his upper room
[2:02:30] he would enter into the upper room
[2:02:33] and then he will go up to heaven
[2:02:38] he had a message to the Ephesus then he
[2:02:42] came down and he wrote to us
[2:02:45] like the New Testament God bless you so
[2:02:49] much that is the reason be me me myself
[2:02:54] before preaching
[2:02:57] the message that that
[2:03:35] I
[2:03:51] also begin preaching my own message here
[2:03:55] I also begin here my own message it is
[2:03:59] not
[2:04:08] before the foundation of the world he
[2:04:11] was the messenger supposed to be here
[2:04:14] there is no way we can change that order
[2:04:17] God bless you so much
[2:04:21] economy
[2:04:24] and the layer
[2:04:28] okay
[2:04:33] 16.
[2:04:35] they had a Stony hearts
[2:04:39] um
[2:04:46] now Ezekiel
[2:04:48] now
[2:04:50] Ezekiel the prophet
[2:04:53] goes up
[2:04:55] and sees the day that we are living in
[2:05:03] Ezekiel went up and saw the time of
[2:05:06] Jesus
[2:05:08] Isaiah went up account November ah yes
[2:05:16] Isaiah went up and so Jesus will be
[2:05:19] baptized by someone from the Wilderness
[2:05:24] that was 800 years before the birth of
[2:05:27] Jesus
[2:05:29] Isaiah went up acaf
[2:05:32] so he even went up to the time of the
[2:05:35] birth of Jesus and he saw akashuka and
[2:05:38] then he came down and then he wrote it
[2:05:45] now even John the Baptist
[2:05:48] he even repeated
[2:05:51] I mean and they said Amina Mimi he said
[2:05:55] me whatever
[2:05:57] they asked him
[2:06:13] let's read that in John chapter one
[2:06:17] foreign
[2:06:30] it says then said they unto him
[2:06:34] who are thou when in any that we may
[2:06:38] give an answer to them that sent us what
[2:06:43] says Thou of thyself he said
[2:06:47] I'm the voice of one crying in the
[2:06:50] wilderness
[2:06:52] make straight the way of the Lord
[2:06:55] I said the prophet Isaiah Isaiah I mean
[2:07:04] that is to say Isaiah saw him
[2:07:08] so it became a promise
[2:07:12] even me as an individual I have that
[2:07:15] promise
[2:07:17] the promise of preaching um
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:22] to the Nations which are on the Eastern
[2:07:25] side of Congress
[2:07:29] I'm also my promises are in Isaiah
[2:07:34] it is in Isaiah 54.
[2:07:38] Isaiah 54 chapter verse verse 3
[2:07:44] um
[2:07:45] let us read it
[2:08:00] for thou shall Break Forth on the right
[2:08:04] hand and on the left
[2:08:06] and I said
[2:08:08] shall inherit the Gentiles and make the
[2:08:13] desolate cities to be inhabited
[2:08:22] now my second promise is just exactly
[2:08:25] like that one of Paul
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:28] um
[2:08:29] we read Acts
[2:08:32] Acts of the Apostles chapter nine Musa
[2:08:38] 15.
[2:08:46] but the Lord said unto him
[2:08:50] go thy way
[2:08:51] for he is a chosen vessel unto me
[2:08:56] to Bear my name for
[2:08:58] before the Gentiles and the Kings and
[2:09:02] children of Israel Nations
[2:09:09] I've ever taken the message to the the
[2:09:12] president of Congo
[2:09:16] I was really taking the other message
[2:09:18] even
[2:09:25] the way the president of Congo came to
[2:09:28] look for me he was following my Ministry
[2:09:31] that preachings via the TV
[2:09:36] so it was through those preachings that
[2:09:39] the president saw me
[2:09:42] and then he said look for me that
[2:09:45] preacher Amina Isaiah
[2:09:51] Isaiah
[2:09:54] Ezekiel 59 now Ezekiel the prophet goes
[2:10:01] up and sees the day that we are living
[2:10:04] in oh what a trip up jacobo slada
[2:10:10] to foresee what will be alibanda

[2:10:26] that is that that ladder of Jacob is the
[2:10:30] very one that Daniel used
[2:10:33] when they cast him in the den of lions
[2:10:39] he fall inside in the ladder of Jacob
[2:10:43] Musa even Moses
[2:10:49] he was in the ladder in Jacobus ladder
[2:10:56] the dry land or the path which they used
[2:11:00] in the Reds
[2:11:01] that was Jacob
[2:11:06] Jacob is the hand of God
[2:11:32] he says he tells them that he tells
[2:11:35] Moses that Pharaoh will not allow you to
[2:11:38] just leave the land
[2:11:40] he will harden his heart and refuse
[2:11:44] that is the time when I myself
[2:11:48] I will stretch forth my hand Exodus
[2:11:54] that is Exodus chapter 3 verse 19. so me
[2:11:58] let's read it

[2:12:10] hand ah and I will stretch out my hand
[2:12:14] and I mean
[2:12:18] I will stretch out my heart

[2:18:35] Jesus just gave the order
[2:18:39] said they said the devil which was in

[2:19:10] God bless you so much
[2:19:13] experience they are Brethren who have

[2:19:19] there is one brother in South Africa the

[2:20:47] taken from the house
[2:20:50] experience we are supposed to experiment
[2:20:53] that experience
[2:20:56] that's the message foreign
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:10] foreign
[2:21:19] for God has a law
[2:21:21] and his word is a law and God in this
[2:21:26] word made certain claims to the church
[2:21:31] when God speaks
[2:21:35] he enters in that word which he has
[2:21:38] spoken that is why he says
[2:21:41] in Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 12.
[2:21:51] he says that I watch over my word so
[2:21:55] that I may make it to come to pass
[2:21:57] now inside the word
[2:22:01] God is inside his word
[2:22:04] the very one who brought that promise
[2:22:08] is inside that promise
[2:22:11] that is why brother
[2:22:15] he took that very promise
[2:22:17] that is Matthew chapter Amina
[2:22:48] for God has a law okay
[2:23:00] okay for God has a law and his word is a
[2:23:07] law and the god in this word made
[2:23:11] certain claims to the church
[2:23:13] therefore we have a right
[2:23:17] to force these claims upon Saturn
[2:23:21] say give it back
[2:23:24] and he has to do it remember is that the
[2:23:27] Holy Spirit
[2:23:29] go write down on our
[2:23:33] I mean now
[2:23:35] Amina
[2:23:37] Amina go write down on our knees and say
[2:23:42] it is that such the Lord he he's got to
[2:23:47] give it up that is all because the holy
[2:23:52] spirit is there to make him do it
[2:23:57] let's read 92 of this is in a message
[2:24:10] as if we are pampering Saturn that you
[2:24:13] know what Saturn if you feel like if it
[2:24:15] is your will give it back to me
[2:24:19] you are supposed to force him rudisha
[2:24:22] return it back upon it may the sick
[2:24:26] receive the healing
[2:24:28] so we got down on our knees see now
[2:24:34] Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for
[2:24:38] he was the one now we are not the one
[2:24:41] the word of the Lord came to the
[2:24:44] prophets they wasn't the word but the
[2:24:47] word came to them
[2:24:49] but Jesus was the one see he didn't have
[2:24:53] to pray he was God himself see but we
[2:24:57] are His prophets
[2:25:00] his servants
[2:25:03] that is to say that brother Branham is
[2:25:06] not God
[2:25:08] hasn't he said it's there
[2:25:11] he says the Lord Jesus Christ is God
[2:25:16] for him is our brother
[2:25:20] let's move on he was God himself see but
[2:25:25] we are His prophets his servants who the
[2:25:29] word of the Lord comes to then the
[2:25:33] prophet is Vindicated by
[2:25:36] whether it is the word of the Lord or
[2:25:38] Not by what he says
[2:25:41] by what he says come to pass
[2:25:45] let's go to 93
[2:25:48] so then we have a scripture here that
[2:25:52] Jesus said
[2:25:54] wherever to or more are gathered in my
[2:25:58] name
[2:25:59] and if they will agree I will be in
[2:26:03] their midst
[2:26:07] that is Matthew 18 19 and 20 Amina and
[2:26:13] if they will agree on touching anyone
[2:26:17] certain
[2:26:20] Amina on touching anyone certain thing
[2:26:22] and ask it don't doubt it they shall
[2:26:27] have what they have asked okay
[2:26:29] let's go to 95 95
[2:26:33] araka now
[2:26:35] we got on our knees about five men with
[2:26:41] the brother Fred shortman and many of
[2:26:45] the others was there four or five men
[2:26:48] and we knelt down and I pleaded this
[2:26:52] case before God
[2:26:53] and then I took the word order
[2:26:59] so now he's
[2:27:02] now he takes that promise
[2:27:07] and he says
[2:27:11] you said when We Gather two or three
[2:27:15] you will be in our Middle East
[2:27:19] and we shall be able to send them angels
[2:27:23] to send the pillar of fire
[2:27:26] to go and restore back whatever that was
[2:27:30] stolen
[2:27:33] and then I took the word or the promise
[2:27:37] and send it forth the great Holy Spirit
[2:27:41] as he took the word to serve the summons
[2:27:46] a vision broke out and I saw a man going
[2:27:50] towards Bowling Green Kentucky with a
[2:27:54] yellow shirt on driving his truck
[2:27:58] now that Thief is returning back
[2:28:01] the Holy Spirit came upon Him condemned
[2:28:04] him and he turned around about halfway
[2:28:09] I saw him come back and pack that car on
[2:28:12] a certain street over across the river
[2:28:16] here

[2:31:17] control room which comes from the

[2:31:30] the Holy Spirit
[2:31:34] you are meant to use that eternal life
[2:31:40] so when you are praying
[2:31:44] when brother Branham began praying he
[2:31:48] says

[2:32:19] praying over an issue where Peter had
[2:32:23] been had been taken into prison your
[2:32:25] experience
[2:32:28] that was that same experience that
[2:32:30] brother Branham had learned from it
[2:32:34] now this Brethren who were praying for
[2:32:37] Peter their prayers
[2:32:40] they were sending their prayers into
[2:32:43] prison
[2:32:45] and they sent the Holy Spirit to go into
[2:32:47] the prison
[2:32:49] may enter inside the prison
[2:32:51] and he may get out
[2:32:56] now that is how it's supposed to be with
[2:32:59] us

[2:33:32] Accord
[2:33:33] what do we mean by Africa
[2:33:36] it is putting right our lives are you
[2:33:41] really hearing me
[2:33:42] it is putting right our lives
[2:33:48] we want to send the eternal life foreign
[2:34:13] another one says Muslim
[2:34:27] may you forgive me my brother
[2:34:30] another one says
[2:34:33] I have some differences with my wife
[2:34:37] this morning as we are here
[2:34:40] I'm requesting
[2:34:43] then I will go to repent and I will even
[2:34:47] repent in the church
[2:34:48] that is what we call agreeing God bless
[2:34:52] you so much
[2:34:54] those who were in the church
[2:34:57] and while Peter was in prison
[2:35:01] they first of all began by agreeing
[2:35:05] that is how brother Branham speaks about
[2:35:07] it it was the same sixth sense one time
[2:35:11] that the Apostle Peter was laying in
[2:35:14] jail and they were going to behead him
[2:35:18] the next day and down at John Mark's
[2:35:22] house they had a prayer meeting
[2:35:26] that 60 cents begin to accumulate around
[2:35:30] the James
[2:35:33] prison now the prayers began
[2:35:36] accumulating in them
[2:35:38] that 60 cents began to accumulate around
[2:35:42] the jail where I had been covered
[2:35:46] by dawa by by prayer that 60 seconds
[2:35:53] that's 60 cents begin to accumulate
[2:35:56] around the jail where I had been covered
[2:36:00] by prayer I mean
[2:36:03] The Sixth Sense went to work
[2:36:06] the pillar of fire
[2:36:08] came in the window and touched Peter and
[2:36:12] saved
[2:36:14] come on get out of here
[2:36:17] The Sixth Sense
[2:36:19] God bless you so much

[2:37:10] before we knew the brother would be here
[2:37:14] that I was going to speak on Romans 10
[2:37:17] 17.
[2:37:20] um
[2:37:22] that faith comes by hearing
[2:37:26] and hearing by the word of God
[2:37:31] the Lord has given us a very good
[2:37:34] foundation
