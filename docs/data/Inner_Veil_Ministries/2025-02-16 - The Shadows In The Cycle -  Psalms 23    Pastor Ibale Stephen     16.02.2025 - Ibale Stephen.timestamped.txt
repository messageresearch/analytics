[22:24] hearts and hide your word in
[22:28] water it by the Holy
[22:30] Spirit and cause it fruit in
[22:34] season in Jesus name amen amen so we are
[22:40] going to turn
[22:42] to the Book of
[22:47] Genesis and that is
[22:50] chapter amen Genesis
[22:54] 8 and we are dealing with verse 22
[23:00] that's our initial
[23:06] scripture while the Earth
[23:10] remain seed time and harvest and cold
[23:16] and heat and summer and winter and day
[23:21] and night shall not Cee
[23:37] those are things that will continue
[23:40] happening over and over
[23:45] again as long as
[23:52] Earth and
[23:54] harvest shall
[23:56] continue all the cold and heat will
[23:59] [Music]
[24:01] continue all the summer and the winter
[24:03] will
[24:05] continue and night will
[24:08] continue may the Lord that
[24:11] blessing to the reading of his
[24:13] word amen you may be
[24:16] seated pray with me the
[24:20] service so that the Lord May impart
[24:23] something upon us today
[24:28] I have a
[24:30] title the shadows in the
[24:35] cycle Psalms
[24:40] 23
[24:41] 23 amen so the shadows in the
[24:48] cycle and then Psalms
[24:53] 23 so that is the cycle of nature now
[25:00] as described in Genesis 8
[25:06] ver all vegetation must navigate through
[25:10] those
[25:13] seasons and we shall take
[25:15] this to bring it into the Natural Life
[25:18] of
[25:20] man that there are certain things that
[25:23] will never
[25:25] ceas but we just need to depend on the
[25:29] LA to help us negotiate all these things
[25:33] in
[25:35] life that's why the song writer says you
[25:38] count your bless I mean your trial is a
[25:44] blessing amen so Psalms 23
[25:50] verse1 the Lord is
[25:53] Myer I shall
[25:56] not now David
[25:59] revelation of God as described by his
[26:03] different I mean
[26:08] attributes he knew him as Jehovah
[26:11] sh he as
[26:15] Jehovah he knew him as Jehovah
[26:18] Shalom he knew him through all his seven
[26:21] Redemptive
[26:23] names so in whatsoever situation he
[26:27] entangled
[26:30] amen he knew that the
[26:33] Lord is my shepher there is no condition
[26:37] that you'll ever get
[26:40] into that God will not have an attribute
[26:44] that will address that
[26:47] condition so a shepher will always have
[26:50] a full program for the
[26:55] ship when he opens up the ship for to
[26:58] the ship
[27:00] out he has a proper
[27:03] program from the time he opens the ship
[27:07] out amen the time he comes back in with
[27:11] the
[27:12] ship we want to thank God before I
[27:16] continue for the grace of God that was
[27:20] able to deliver sister
[27:24] aliel amen and also Brother John
[27:29] so that they had
[27:31] the it has been a
[27:34] battle but even in
[27:39] there so brother Fred
[27:45] me that I appreciate you for your
[27:48] prayers
[27:51] amen so you know God has a proper
[27:55] program for the ship
[27:59] when he opens the
[28:02] Shen you know he knows where they
[28:06] gra it just doesn't
[28:09] open so that the ship May
[28:12] Lo he knows where to lead the
[28:17] ship he knows where they'll go for
[28:21] water he has the security plan for the
[28:26] ship amen that's the way the Lord deals
[28:29] with
[28:30] us you just wake up in the
[28:33] morning and you say Lord lead me
[28:37] not amen he knows what you have need
[28:42] of he knows all the dangers the Sheep
[28:45] will
[28:47] face he knows about the wolves in the
[28:52] field but the secur
[28:55] plan is to restore the ship back into
[28:57] the
[29:00] he knows one may just kind of
[29:04] stray but he knows when to live the
[29:09] 9 to go and look for that
[29:13] one so amen that's the doctrine of
[29:17] eternal
[29:21] security are you together with me there
[29:23] is what we call eternal security
[29:28] you know the teaching on eternal
[29:32] security was too hard for the prophet
[29:38] own amen until after the opening of The
[29:42] Seven
[29:44] seal but I want to say without eternal
[29:49] security we would never make
[29:53] it we are what we
[29:55] are because the ship and I mean the
[29:58] shepherd has all the
[30:02] plans he says I know all the plans I
[30:05] have for
[30:07] you at the end of it all the plan for
[30:12] good not the plan for bad so it doesn't
[30:17] matter what Shadows we go through in
[30:20] life all that is for our own
[30:24] good when you didn't have a meal
[30:28] was for your good whether you're
[30:31] married or you're not
[30:33] married believe God knows about
[30:37] it and for the situation where you
[30:41] are it is for your own
[30:44] girl are you together with me amen
[30:48] eternal
[30:49] security is goding
[30:52] [Music]
[30:58] because that seed is
[31:00] eternal and it's a part of him are you
[31:04] together with me so God watches over
[31:08] you as you negotiate from the shadows in
[31:11] the Cy of
[31:14] life into the full St of a perfect
[31:18] man amen you grow negotiating through
[31:24] SE C and
[31:28] winter and
[31:30] summer is not going to be the same all
[31:32] the
[31:34] time amen we are going to come through
[31:39] situations where you even sometimes be
[31:42] tempted to
[31:45] question where is God in
[31:48] this that could be your winter
[31:52] time amen you are so
[31:55] cold sometimes you may not even be
[31:59] able to lift up your
[32:02] hands and be able to
[32:05] pray while you are in that
[32:07] condition there is still something deep
[32:10] down on the
[32:13] side which keeps telling you you are my
[32:18] son amen those are just shadows in the
[32:24] ccle those moments are what we call
[32:28] the shadows in the cycle of
[32:33] Life talk about you know we shall talk
[32:36] about the temperate
[32:39] climate temperate climate like those
[32:42] climate where we have snow summer winter
[32:46] things like
[32:50] that you know some of the
[32:53] seeds are planted before winter
[33:00] winter amen and you know
[33:03] winter is so
[33:06] cold you are counting in the
[33:11] negative you don't count into the
[33:13] positive you count into the
[33:19] negative amen and sometimes it even
[33:24] snows and it becomes the block on the
[33:27] floor
[33:31] but
[33:32] remember there is some seed in the
[33:36] ground are you together with me that's
[33:39] the way God
[33:40] works he allows the
[33:43] seed to negotiate that I mean that
[33:47] shadow in
[33:50] the amen some of them are planted six
[33:54] eight weeks before winter
[33:59] amen like you know the B planted much
[34:05] earlier they must Brave the
[34:08] snow and come all the way to the
[34:13] Harvest say brother Sten you don't know
[34:15] what I go
[34:17] through I don't have to know what you go
[34:21] through God knows what you
[34:24] got amen and he's going to watch you
[34:29] through all these cycles of
[34:32] Life their effects during the changing
[34:39] weathers upon the pennial plants like
[34:44] trees but you see they go through the
[34:47] Shadows of the
[34:50] cycle because time
[34:53] comes when it's not joy and the Glory
[34:56] Hallelujah
[35:04] you know you are so
[35:06] cold you are like John the Baptist in
[35:10] prison you are saying are you one we
[35:13] should wait for another
[35:16] one those moments come they come in our
[35:21] families they come in our Christian
[35:24] lives they come in our economy
[35:28] they come in our
[35:30] businesses and sometimes you
[35:33] question is this the right
[35:35] PA are you together with me but even
[35:39] then God is not far
[35:42] away the Lord is my
[35:45] shepherd I shall
[35:47] not praise the Lord so there are
[35:52] effects like when the weather is
[35:55] changing
[35:57] from
[35:59] Summer before it goes into
[36:02] winter there is what we call the
[36:06] fall amen so all the trees begin to live
[36:11] their lose their
[36:14] leaves because of the shter time of
[36:21] life because it gets so I mean it gets
[36:26] dark so early
[36:29] and so the
[36:31] trees they kind of get to lose their
[36:36] leaves because they don't have enough
[36:39] energy without the
[36:43] light to hold those
[36:46] leaves amen and yet the tree would have
[36:50] wanted those
[36:52] leaves and the light because that's the
[36:56] way they Fe
[36:58] are you together with me but God allows
[37:01] those
[37:03] situations and he says sit time and
[37:08] timeat and
[37:12] C winter and
[37:15] summer shall not
[37:18] see the tree gets into that situation
[37:21] this
[37:23] year and again is get in the same
[37:25] situation the next year
[37:29] are you together with me so sometimes
[37:32] you may go to the
[37:34] pastor I do not know why I am going
[37:38] through
[37:40] this but
[37:42] remember that it is a cycle of
[37:45] life you are not going to be all
[37:48] Hallelujah every
[37:51] dayjah hallelujah hallelujah moments
[37:54] will come when you just need to trust
[37:57] God
[37:59] when the answer is not
[38:01] there you have prayed and seems like
[38:05] heaven has
[38:07] closed but that's how you
[38:10] feel it's just a dark
[38:13] moment in a CLE of
[38:16] life but God has not deserted
[38:20] you amen the trees know how to prepare
[38:25] for that moment
[38:28] they lose their
[38:30] leaves so that they can conserve the
[38:36] moisture Amen in them because they are
[38:40] going in a rough
[38:44] time are you together with me so they
[38:47] dro the tree I mean the
[38:49] leaves because the leaves would make the
[38:53] water the moisture expire during the Sun
[39:01] so spiritually
[39:03] speaking these moments could be
[39:06] described by the words of
[39:12] theist amen says even though I walk
[39:17] through the valley of the shadow of
[39:22] death
[39:23] amen I fear no
[39:26] evil amen
[39:28] praise the Lord I know that storms will
[39:31] gather around
[39:33] you sometimes storms will gather around
[39:36] the
[39:38] family but I want you to know that those
[39:42] are just
[39:43] shadows in the cycle of
[39:47] life amen nature will always expect
[39:53] them because the Bible
[39:55] says as long as life
[40:00] is amen those conditions will never
[40:05] cease praise the Lord this
[40:08] morning so I want to use this
[40:12] cycle to describe the cycles of
[40:16] life that will forever live with
[40:21] us trials will always be with
[40:25] us Temptations will always be with
[40:29] us will always be with
[40:32] us
[40:34] moment in our families will always be
[40:37] with us so you better learn how to
[40:41] depend on the Good
[40:44] Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah whatever
[40:47] situation
[40:48] comes the Lord is my
[40:50] sheer the Lord in what
[40:54] attributes May Jehovah shalom
[40:58] is what I need but he will always be
[41:02] God in the seven Redemptive
[41:06] name all those situations will be
[41:09] there but all in know the grace to take
[41:13] us through the
[41:15] shadows will also be there with
[41:20] us
[41:22] amen so this Shadow
[41:25] sometimes they very prominent in the
[41:28] history of a
[41:31] Christian but God will focus on how
[41:36] constant on how
[41:40] constant you kind of fall back to
[41:47] him amen you just kind of fall on the
[41:50] loving arms of
[41:54] Jehovah because you think here and there
[41:58] and you don't have an answer that's when
[42:00] the enemy comes and says you know what
[42:05] there is no
[42:07] God then you say God is there you prove
[42:12] then he changes this
[42:14] statement but he doesn't love
[42:20] you there are situations we go
[42:24] through you see there was we should
[42:28] know that we should always
[42:33] learn every day to take our daily
[42:41] sacrifice you know the daily
[42:44] sacrifice Lord
[42:46] Jesus have mer upon me I have made a
[42:50] mistake here I have fallen here I've
[42:53] done this here you just kind of keep
[42:56] your s
[42:59] clean so that God may not keep a
[43:02] distance from
[43:04] you amen so that you may always be close
[43:08] to
[43:10] Jehovah I want to remind you about the
[43:14] journey from
[43:16] Egypt to the
[43:18] promise which is a type of the work of a
[43:22] Christian the life of sin to the bom of
[43:26] the Holy
[43:28] together with me so there was the Feast
[43:31] of the
[43:33] Passover that theed you from the Egypt
[43:36] of
[43:38] sin and when you were delivered from the
[43:41] Egypt of
[43:43] sin then there is another Feast that you
[43:46] normally rely
[43:49] on the Feast of the
[43:52] atonement that the Lamb of
[43:55] God infected for you upon
[43:59] C amen you know the daily
[44:05] sacrifice the blood which never ceases
[44:09] to clean the
[44:13] believer will always be
[44:16] present but then even after the Feast of
[44:20] atonement we always have these daily
[44:23] sacrifices I'm talking about
[44:27] to pull the
[44:29] children Through The Dark
[44:33] Shadows amen if the devil has put a
[44:36] stain on
[44:38] you amen there is a
[44:41] light in the
[44:43] shadow to reveal these
[44:47] dos so that we may take them to
[44:50] God in
[44:52] confession in prayer and saying God have
[44:56] mercy upon me
[44:59] amen let me say it in this way
[45:02] maybe that
[45:04] Abraham our father had Shadows also in
[45:09] the Cy of his
[45:15] calling are you together with me
[45:19] Abraham the father of
[45:23] faith in his
[45:25] walk he experien certain shadows in the
[45:29] cycle of his
[45:33] call listen now on two
[45:38] occasions he feared
[45:41] famine just after he had settled in the
[45:45] land he ran out into
[45:48] Egypt amen and again he ran out a second
[45:54] time to J
[45:58] but on both
[46:01] occasions we see him sink the
[46:08] Shad you know he loses the sense of
[46:12] Victory God gave
[46:15] him he begins to fear the Nations around
[46:20] him he tells his wife say you are my
[46:23] sister don't say you are my wife
[46:27] but when he was in the
[46:29] land in full
[46:32] light amen he wouldn't fear the kings
[46:35] that invaded
[46:37] him so many times we would get into
[46:42] positions where
[46:43] Shadows kind of would want to make an
[46:48] eclipse between you and
[46:53] God our father abrah went through that
[46:58] it was a
[46:59] shadow when he came to his
[47:02] wife to have a son with
[47:05] h it was a
[47:07] shadow when Sarah and
[47:11] Abraham laugh at two different
[47:14] occasions when the Lord was confirming
[47:17] the Covenant to
[47:19] them Genesis
[47:23] 177 Abram laugh amen Bible says he fell
[47:28] on his back and
[47:30] laugh Genesis
[47:35] 1812 are you together with me those were
[47:39] all moments of Shadows in the
[47:43] cycle but
[47:45] remember you know the
[47:48] protection was always around the
[47:52] city I want you to begin
[47:57] in that you are a twofold
[48:00] being there is the which come from
[48:05] God Amen which is
[48:08] the it stays on
[48:11] the amen of the
[48:14] soul but then there is another
[48:18] you which is
[48:20] directly connected to the circumstances
[48:24] of life
[48:27] you are the one who gets
[48:30] hungry amen you are the one who lacks
[48:33] the the necessities of
[48:36] life and that's where the enemy tries to
[48:39] get
[48:41] to so that he can get access to the seed
[48:44] on the
[48:47] side are you together with me when you
[48:50] get into
[48:52] situations of real
[48:55] need and you are on the
[48:58] outside maybe you are sick maybe you are
[49:02] lacking you
[49:05] remember the you is
[49:09] [Music]
[49:10] on and there the devil can't get
[49:15] there amen those shadows will always
[49:20] crowd around the natural
[49:23] man but your election
[49:26] deep down on the side
[49:29] there so what we need is to ask God to
[49:34] pile word on top of
[49:37] word like that until we become the full
[49:44] St the Son of God or daughter of
[49:49] God hallelujah hallelujah so when that
[49:52] seed is fed on the word
[49:57] word it knows how to
[49:59] react when the situations
[50:02] come he was the
[50:05] word made
[50:07] manifest when he was on the mountain and
[50:10] the enemy came he knew how to
[50:13] react to the shadows in the
[50:18] C are you together with me so what we
[50:23] need is to ask God
[50:26] let the
[50:27] word work on my
[50:30] life amen let's talk a little bit about
[50:33] this
[50:36] etern the etal
[50:39] security is given to the inner
[50:42] man because he the one that is
[50:46] eternal amen he's the one that is
[50:51] eternal amen but this one here he dies
[50:57] amen and the only way can become
[51:01] Eternal is when he spoken
[51:06] again into the
[51:09] Rapture or into the
[51:11] resurrection amen praise the Lord so
[51:15] with eternal
[51:17] security God breaks the Heart of
[51:23] Stone by the teaching of the word
[51:27] that you may develop a broken and
[51:29] contrite
[51:32] spirit amen he breaks your
[51:36] nature he breaks your character and he
[51:40] does this to
[51:44] the amen
[51:48] E6
[51:51] verse6
[51:52] amen a new heart
[51:57] also will I give
[52:01] you and a new spirit will I put within
[52:06] you and I take the
[52:11] St out of your
[52:13] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[52:19] Flesh amen so God begins to do a
[52:24] transplant
[52:28] a
[52:30] s amen he comes as a Serge
[52:34] now and he says I have come to give you
[52:39] a new
[52:40] spirit and when you have a new
[52:43] spirit then it
[52:45] means that this Heart of
[52:48] Stone has been taken away and if the
[52:52] Heart of Stone is taken
[52:54] away when the word come to us is always
[52:59] amen are you together with me because
[53:03] everything
[53:05] else that is not
[53:08] God gets pushed out of the
[53:11] Soul are you together with me and the
[53:14] only thing that remains
[53:16] there is that
[53:19] se that has got the ear of the
[53:22] spirit that when God speaks
[53:26] praise amen so the nature that
[53:30] fails and the nature that Rebels against
[53:34] God is totally expelled from the circles
[53:37] of the
[53:42] soul and it comes down to the human
[53:47] Spirit are you together with me that's
[53:50] where he lives that's where reasoning
[53:54] is but we thank God
[53:57] you are here because the Heart of
[54:01] Stone was
[54:04] broken so what you have has the ability
[54:08] to
[54:10] sayen when the word is
[54:13] spoken you know how to react to the
[54:16] word amen and now when he has given you
[54:20] a new
[54:21] spirit verse 27
[54:24] says I'll put my
[54:27] my spirit within
[54:30] you amen Anda
[54:35] you hallelujah hallelujah
[54:39] you meaning that God over our
[54:44] lives and then he causes
[54:47] us not that we
[54:50] want but he causes us he takes control
[54:56] become love
[54:59] slaves he says
[55:02] I will cause you hallelujah hallelujah
[55:06] you God CA to come to church
[55:10] today Goda you to be
[55:13] here amen he says I'll cause
[55:18] you to walk in my
[55:21] statutes and shall keep my
[55:24] judgments and do them

[55:54] walk according the prince of the power
[55:57] of the
[56:00] air and the spirit that now work in the
[56:03] children of
[56:06] disob Amen praise the Lord he will cause
[56:10] you to
[56:12] evolve from the nature that made you
[56:15] live like the
[56:17] world but you are not part of the
[56:20] W but there was a
[56:23] force that hold of
[56:27] amen and kept in a
[56:30] shadow but deep Down On

[59:38] Lord You Know The
[59:41] Enemy much as the seed is
[59:45] bought he doesn't give up on
[59:49] you he keeps casting a Shad upon
[59:52] you and that's what I'm talking about
[59:56] the shadows in the
[1:00:01] cycle amen those
[1:00:04] Winters that come to disfigure the
[1:00:09] tree it doesn't need to be bear like
[1:00:14] that but it's going through a
[1:00:19] shadow hallelujah hallelujah I want to
[1:00:22] tell you one thing that much as we are
[1:00:25] born again
[1:00:27] doesn't give up on
[1:00:30] you the next time if the Lord allows
[1:00:33] when I stand
[1:00:36] here I want to speak on the statement of
[1:00:41] Paul that I Die
[1:00:46] daily he goes to the Cross
[1:00:51] daily so you know Jesus listen
[1:00:57] he was led of the Holy
[1:01:00] Spirit to the mountains to be tempted of
[1:01:04] the
[1:01:05] devil as long as that
[1:01:10] seed comes into the body of
[1:01:13] Flesh It
[1:01:16] suffers
[1:01:18] Temptation
[1:01:20] trials
[1:01:22] situations the enemy wants to buff the
[1:01:28] outside so that he could get the
[1:01:31] inside but Jesus being the word he
[1:01:35] defeated the
[1:01:37] Devil by saying it is
[1:01:40] written it is written it's written but
[1:01:45] even when he punched him
[1:01:48] down L
[1:01:52] 43 he says and when the devil ended all
[1:01:55] the temp
[1:01:59] he departed from him for a
[1:02:05] season he never leaves you
[1:02:09] permanently he left him for a
[1:02:13] season you are
[1:02:16] free by the blood of
[1:02:19] Cal but
[1:02:21] remember he only will never give up
[1:02:26] he try to get
[1:02:30] around by getting into the human
[1:02:33] spirit and brother Bram preaches the
[1:02:37] message the greatest B ever
[1:02:40] fall so you are in
[1:02:42] battle the devil tries to throw
[1:02:47] darkness in front of you that he may
[1:02:51] make him invisible
[1:02:56] amen and those that
[1:02:59] shadows and the
[1:03:01] shadow can only come because there is
[1:03:07] light so when those Shadows
[1:03:10] come then you know you got the
[1:03:14] LIE when you get
[1:03:17] convicted when you done something
[1:03:21] wrong you should know that deep down on
[1:03:23] the side
[1:03:26] there is
[1:03:27] light amen a sinner wouldn't
[1:03:32] care but a child of God you get a
[1:03:37] conviction that means there is light on
[1:03:39] the
[1:03:40] inside and when you get into that
[1:03:44] situation then you know it's a shadow in
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:51] cyle praise the
[1:03:53] Lord amen see you struggle with
[1:03:58] situations because the devil still lives
[1:04:02] somewhere in the
[1:04:04] middle he has access to your
[1:04:08] mind and sometimes you get
[1:04:12] offended because of the blun lies that
[1:04:16] come out of
[1:04:18] you the jealous fights that bother
[1:04:23] you those are shadows in the
[1:04:28] amen because you are
[1:04:30] human so we all as Paul
[1:04:34] says had our conversations in the time
[1:04:41] p in the last of our
[1:04:44] flesh filling the desire of the
[1:04:48] Flesh and of the
[1:04:50] mind and by
[1:04:54] Nature that children of
[1:04:57] WRA as
[1:05:00] others he doesn't say we
[1:05:04] are but he says in time
[1:05:08] P we just live like in the
[1:05:15] world are you together with me yeah
[1:05:20] say you know you just walking by the
[1:05:23] last of one flesh
[1:05:25] fill the
[1:05:27] desires of the mind and were by
[1:05:31] Nature the children
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:40] of he doesn't say we
[1:05:43] are the time
[1:05:47] pass
[1:05:50] so
[1:05:51] God has called you out
[1:05:56] but then like he never left
[1:06:00] Christ he left him for a
[1:06:04] season the devil will always walk
[1:06:10] behind to see what you're thinking to
[1:06:14] see how you are handling your
[1:06:16] life but God who is Rich
[1:06:20] iny bles Us in Psalms
[1:06:24] 23 hallelujah hallelujah the Lord is my
[1:06:28] shepherd I shall not want he doesn't
[1:06:32] allow the

[1:06:37] ship without a
[1:06:39] shepher going together with the
[1:06:42] sh hallelujah hallelujah it's not where
[1:06:46] I want to
[1:06:48] go but where the Lord wants you to
[1:06:52] go amen he guides us
[1:06:56] he places the word before
[1:06:59] us that's why he says in verse
[1:07:02] two he make me to lie down in Green
[1:07:08] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[1:07:13] Water he my
[1:07:17] soul he me in the path of righteousness
[1:07:21] for his name
[1:07:24] sake Hallelujah Hallelujah so he has
[1:07:27] placed Us in Psalms
[1:07:30] 23 where he makes
[1:07:33] us in whatever we do we should always
[1:07:39] surrender he will
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:43] do
[1:07:44] amen it's you know it's him to
[1:07:50] Will and to do his good place
[1:07:55] yeah that's the thing we need to do
[1:07:58] every morning we wake
[1:08:00] up is to
[1:08:04] surrender so that the shepherd
[1:08:08] himself who has a good plan for
[1:08:11] us can lead the path of our life on a
[1:08:15] daily
[1:08:19] basis and this Shepherd here
[1:08:23] knows that you live in a addicting
[1:08:26] situation of
[1:08:29] Life there is this outer thing
[1:08:32] here wrestles against the
[1:08:37] in that's why David
[1:08:41] says a little
[1:08:43] bit but he rest my
[1:08:46] soul hallelujah hallelujah he restor my
[1:08:50] soul when he brings you into the path of
[1:08:53] righteous

[1:08:59] off what a love
[1:09:03] brother amen praise the Lord I pray that
[1:09:07] the Lord may give me the
[1:09:10] grace to bring this out to you this
[1:09:13] morning amen that
[1:09:16] shepher always
[1:09:18] knows where he was the Sheep to
[1:09:21] God Amen he is that sheep
[1:09:26] into areas of his
[1:09:30] choice
[1:09:36] pastures Still
[1:09:38] Waters amen praise the Lord so every one
[1:09:42] of us should always pray Lord reveal to
[1:09:47] me the mystery of your
[1:09:50] will amen don't you look for you know
[1:09:55] don't don't you just walk after
[1:09:59] somebody the sheer
[1:10:01] himself he has a plan for

[1:10:10] ver of the
[1:10:13] word amen the voice that I am you are
[1:10:17] not the voice that you

[1:10:23] same
[1:10:25] but yet the shepherd is the
[1:10:27] same you make us
[1:10:30] overcome maybe your trial is big like a
[1:10:35] job could be a smaller
[1:10:38] one

[1:11:32] around you are
[1:11:34] fearful you know where you are
[1:11:38] stepping you are being very
[1:11:41] careful now like brother Joshua on the
[1:11:45] motorcycle and the
[1:11:49] snake you can
[1:11:52] imagine it's Darkness
[1:11:55] anything can
[1:11:58] happen but
[1:12:00] then there is a
[1:12:02] comfort that David is
[1:12:06] testifying that though I walk through
[1:12:08] the valley of the shadow of
[1:12:12] death fear no
[1:12:15] evil can you
[1:12:17] imagine God going with you in Valley of
[1:12:22] the Shadows of death
[1:12:26] she's the
[1:12:28] light that makes the
[1:12:31] shadow in the time of
[1:12:37] Darkness so whatever Shadow you go
[1:12:40] through is because the
[1:12:43] light is always
[1:12:49] with you love him
[1:12:52] friend what a God we serve
[1:12:56] am the shepherd is away of the Shadows
[1:12:59] along the
[1:13:01] way and it's those
[1:13:04] shadow that the W can try to
[1:13:10] hide so that they can be able to catch
[1:13:13] the
[1:13:15] Sheep but the sheer is always
[1:13:20] there and many
[1:13:22] times sheep is so unconscious of the
[1:13:25] danger in the
[1:13:29] shadows and it's in these
[1:13:31] Shadows that the sheep can lose focus of
[1:13:36] the
[1:13:43] sheer because there is the
[1:13:45] shadow
[1:13:47] of but yet the master
[1:13:51] himself will never lose sight of you
[1:13:57] his eyes upon every one of
[1:14:01] us he knows when your hair
[1:14:06] Falls amen he knows how much of the hair
[1:14:09] you've ever
[1:14:11] lost the shepherd keeps his
[1:14:14] eye over the ship that's why he
[1:14:19] knows that there is a ship that has
[1:14:22] stray amen
[1:14:27] will take him out of the way to go and
[1:14:30] get that
[1:14:32] ship
[1:14:34] amen oh my brother the shepher can
[1:14:38] through see through the
[1:14:42] shadows and he know when to use the
[1:14:47] road anduse the
[1:14:50] Stars to comfort the Sheep
[1:14:55] hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord he
[1:14:58] loves to carry his
[1:15:01] sheep yes sir but
[1:15:04] sometimes what he does is to use the
[1:15:08] road and the
[1:15:18] stuff are you together with me but when
[1:15:22] he uses the road
[1:15:25] that's another way of
[1:15:30] his are you together with me brother
[1:15:33] Bram tells a
[1:15:35] story and he say the old Shepherd story
[1:15:38] that was told in
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:42] Jerusalem in the lands of the
[1:15:47] shepher was ping
[1:15:52] ship and he says why are you parking it
[1:15:56] for said it's got a broken
[1:16:00] leg how did it do
[1:16:03] that from a
[1:16:06] cff I broke its
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:15] leg he said why you are CR sheer to
[1:16:20] break the ship's
[1:16:23] leg say no I loved
[1:16:28] it hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:16:34] St they comfort
[1:16:37] me and said it was
[1:16:41] going and I couldn't make it mind
[1:16:46] me so I broke it
[1:16:49] SL so that I could give it some extra
[1:16:53] attention
[1:16:55] so then it would love me
[1:17:01] me that's
[1:17:03] theer that's the
[1:17:06] wisdom Ro and
[1:17:09] stff sometimes God has to let us break
[1:17:14] down a little bit in
[1:17:17] health to give us a little extra
[1:17:22] attention to get us up on his
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:30] B the doctor
[1:17:32] says amen nothing can be
[1:17:35] done then he take us in his
[1:17:38] BOS see I love you I'm going to get you
[1:17:43] well doesn't that just make life a
[1:17:47] little
[1:17:50] better are you seeing those Paradox
[1:17:53] areas
[1:17:55] those
[1:17:59] Paradox amen you just cannot
[1:18:03] understand why you are going through
[1:18:05] what you are going
[1:18:07] through that's the road and
[1:18:10] stuff to help you in the
[1:18:14] [Music]
[1:18:17] shadow then the ship
[1:18:20] finds cannot run
[1:18:23] anymore cannot run
[1:18:26] one time he had a sheep like
[1:18:30] that and his name was
[1:18:33] jaob he broke his
[1:18:36] leg and he walked
[1:18:40] different he was careful in what he was
[1:18:44] doing he was not
[1:18:47] fast sometimes some of us are too
[1:18:52] fast in the things we do
[1:18:55] we don't wait upon
[1:18:57] the we don't mind him that's the reason
[1:19:01] the ship was
[1:19:04] broken can I said
[1:19:07] Lord break
[1:19:14] us it's strange isn't
[1:19:17] it but you see that's the only way he
[1:19:20] can take the Sheep
[1:19:25] it was running
[1:19:27] fast it was going
[1:19:29] astray he couldn't get
[1:19:32] it
[1:19:34] says I have to get you back into
[1:19:37] the amen God will allow to break some of
[1:19:42] us to get us back in the
[1:19:48] fall
[1:19:50] okay now verse five is very interesting
[1:19:57] sometimes we are just encircled by
[1:20:00] forces we don't
[1:20:04] understand people that you cannot
[1:20:07] explain they make your life very
[1:20:12] uncomfortable the Bible is calling them
[1:20:17] enemies they could be
[1:20:19] neighbors they could be false
[1:20:23] Brethren they could be situations in
[1:20:25] your
[1:20:26] life that wants to take away your
[1:20:31] peace all those are shadows in the
[1:20:36] cycle you just get down to your
[1:20:41] door and the neighbor begins on
[1:20:44] you you g through those kind of
[1:20:48] situations God
[1:20:51] promises that you should not lose your
[1:20:54] peace
[1:20:57] even with
[1:20:59] those
[1:21:02] Hees he cares that you
[1:21:06] overcome and he says though prepares a
[1:21:09] table before me in the presence of my
[1:21:16] enemies thou anointest my head with
[1:21:21] oil my cup
[1:21:25] so the shepherd doesn't want the
[1:21:28] Sheep to lose their
[1:21:32] sleep over the negative environment
[1:21:36] around
[1:21:39] the amen there could be
[1:21:42] trials there could be tribulations of
[1:21:44] some
[1:21:46] kind there could be WS around the
[1:21:51] ship but when that one happens
[1:21:55] then David would
[1:21:57] say the Lord is my
[1:22:00] shepher I shall
[1:22:02] not you remember the time when
[1:22:06] J was
[1:22:08] sacrificing in the time of
[1:22:11] War when the angel of the Lord came down
[1:22:15] to consume the
[1:22:17] sacrifice he identified
[1:22:20] himself for the first time as Jehovah
[1:22:24] shalom
[1:22:26] hallelujah hallelujah when those
[1:22:28] situations
[1:22:30] come amen as a sh the
[1:22:35] covah
[1:22:37] Shalom amen live in set a
[1:22:42] table just settle
[1:22:46] down he'll anoint you and your cup will
[1:22:50] run over I want tell you there's nothing
[1:22:54] that the devil does that will bring you
[1:22:57] down in the shadows in the
[1:23:01] cycle will always be
[1:23:03] there
[1:23:05] 33 will go with you through the
[1:23:09] cycles
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:12] verse David now
[1:23:16] confirms
[1:23:17] goodness and Mery shall follow me all
[1:23:22] the days of my life I in the house of
[1:23:26] the Lord
[1:23:27] forever Lord to be part of the house of
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:32] Lord yes sir why do I walk
[1:23:36] away from the
[1:23:38] ship praise God when we've got a God who
[1:23:44] cares amen so the shadows in the
[1:23:49] cycle
[1:23:51] unnecessary to clean out our house
[1:23:55] because wherever tension Rises around
[1:24:00] us God will always come
[1:24:03] down with words of
[1:24:06] instruction with words of
[1:24:08] Correction therefore you serve
[1:24:11] God is not throwing you
[1:24:14] away because the
[1:24:18] cyle has shadows in it
[1:24:26] stay in the right word
[1:24:30] atmosphere until the word breaks
[1:24:40] out let there be
[1:24:43] light hallelujah hallelujah you remember
[1:24:47] the
[1:24:48] shadows in the
[1:24:50] creation the Holy Spirit never went out
[1:24:55] he stayed there
[1:24:58] until he says Let
[1:25:00] there and the light was the
[1:25:07] word how we
[1:25:10] desire to
[1:25:11] dwell in the
[1:25:15] word praise the
[1:25:17] Lord stay in the right word
[1:25:23] atmosphere no not that there is no
[1:25:26] light but there is enough light in
[1:25:32] there to clear out the
[1:25:37] Shadows there's a light in the seed
[1:25:40] gen and it's a growing
[1:25:45] light it's a growing
[1:25:49] light
[1:25:52] growing amen
[1:25:54] Bram says when a man is
[1:25:57] saved that much of him is
[1:26:09] God that much of
[1:26:13] God that much of him is
[1:26:16] God when a man is saved that much of him
[1:26:20] is
[1:26:22] God yes because there is a match of God
[1:26:25] in
[1:26:27] him so he becomes a little March Of
[1:26:31] God that's the little light that comes
[1:26:35] in to make you quit doing what is
[1:26:40] wrong now if you can take all the
[1:26:51] malice and stri
[1:26:55] and Bel
[1:26:56] out that little button like of
[1:27:02] light and the power of God will keep
[1:27:07] growing growing growing growing cring
[1:27:13] out
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:16] unbelief and you don't do it by
[1:27:18] exaltations of Bly exercise
[1:27:29] no the light
[1:27:33] grows you do it by Sanctified
[1:27:37] consecrated
[1:27:41] life that the holy spirit moves through
[1:27:46] you so what brother Bram is
[1:27:49] saying is that God has deposed a
[1:27:54] amount of light in
[1:27:58] you and as that
[1:28:01] grows it crowds out the Shadows Of
[1:28:07] Darkness one day you will be a church
[1:28:11] without
[1:28:12] spot
[1:28:15] or because that light
[1:28:18] grows amen and I'm sure as we are
[1:28:21] sharing the word here
[1:28:24] the light on the inside is
[1:28:27] growing amen it is exposing certain dark
[1:28:32] areas there are certain things you are
[1:28:34] throwing
[1:28:36] out that's how the light
[1:28:40] grow amen so but brother
[1:28:44] Steven I am all
[1:28:47] Shadows yes but the little light will
[1:28:51] keep growing
[1:28:56] amen it will keep
[1:28:58] growing there is something you feel in
[1:29:01] you which you said this is
[1:29:05] God that will
[1:29:09] grow amen
[1:29:11] am brother Bram
[1:29:15] says though I walk
[1:29:18] through sh of the Valley of Death
[1:29:24] it could not be the
[1:29:26] dark and yet have a
[1:29:33] shadow praise the Lord though I walk
[1:29:37] through the
[1:29:38] valley of the shadow of
[1:29:42] death some people
[1:29:53] sayy but it doesn't say that it's the
[1:29:58] Valley of the
[1:30:00] shadow of light I mean of of
[1:30:04] death which
[1:30:06] means if it was
[1:30:10] Darkness then there couldn't be a
[1:30:13] shadow the
[1:30:15] shadow is because there is
[1:30:19] light there light
[1:30:22] ofine I'm going to let it
[1:30:26] shine This Little Light of Mine amen I'm
[1:30:29] going to let it shine there a little
[1:30:32] light of mine I'm going to let It Shine
[1:30:37] Let It Shine Let It
[1:30:42] Shine it could not be
[1:30:45] dark and a shadow for there has to be a
[1:30:49] certain percent of light
[1:30:54] it can be a
[1:30:55] shadow it was perfectly dark if was if
[1:30:59] it was perfectly
[1:31:02] dark there would be no
[1:31:04] Shadow though I walk through the shadow
[1:31:07] of the Valley of
[1:31:10] Death hallelujah hallelujah so every one
[1:31:14] of you you are here because there is a
[1:31:17] certain amount of
[1:31:20] light if there was no light
[1:31:24] you wouldn't be here but there is a
[1:31:27] light that has brought you to the
[1:31:31] service
[1:31:34] today and my
[1:31:37] prayer is let that light keep
[1:31:42] growing the light is in the
[1:31:46] se but the
[1:31:48] Shadows crow in the human spirit
[1:31:54] that's where the Shadows
[1:31:56] are amen so that the
[1:32:00] soul could not really be able to
[1:32:04] command the manifestation of
[1:32:07] God on the outside
[1:32:09] man so in the S is the light of
[1:32:15] Revelation and Po in Revelation I mean
[1:32:21] Ephesians he said the
[1:32:24] of your
[1:32:28] understanding one time brother Bram
[1:32:30] preached the eye of
[1:32:33] God Amen that you
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] see eye of
[1:32:41] God and the eye of
[1:32:43] God is in the
[1:32:46] CG hallelujah hallelujah and in there is
[1:32:50] where the ear of understanding is
[1:32:58] the eyes of your
[1:33:00] understanding being
[1:33:03] enlightened that he may know what is the
[1:33:07] hope of his
[1:33:11] calling and what the riches of the glory
[1:33:14] of his inheritance in the
[1:33:20] S so what's the light in there for
[1:33:26] the light on
[1:33:28] side amen is the only
[1:33:32] way you can be able to see
[1:33:35] God in the
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] darkness you discern his
[1:33:44] presence
[1:33:46] sometimes you
[1:33:48] know when you are a
[1:33:51] Christian you can be able to see
[1:33:55] God see God by
[1:33:59] the you will be able to
[1:34:02] sense if there is a certain form of
[1:34:06] Darkness trying to crowd that
[1:34:15] light okay so the light on the
[1:34:20] inside exposes
[1:34:25] the shadows in the
[1:34:28] cycle so that you can apply the
[1:34:32] blood on those
[1:34:36] Shadows this one here is
[1:34:39] Darkness this one is Darkness this one
[1:34:42] is darkness and you keep applying the
[1:34:45] blood that's why you
[1:34:49] thear of your soul not because you are a
[1:34:55] Darkness but because there are certain
[1:34:58] Shadows to deal
[1:35:01] with are you together with me yeah
[1:35:05] sometimes the devil come and tell
[1:35:07] you you don't have life the reason why
[1:35:12] you hate
[1:35:15] sin is because you have
[1:35:21] light you ask God help me
[1:35:24] that I may fight this thing out of my
[1:35:28] life and the more you get the light of
[1:35:30] the knowledge of the
[1:35:33] word is the
[1:35:35] more the Shadows that you are dealing
[1:35:39] with are
[1:35:42] exposed because light and
[1:35:45] darkness cannot dwell
[1:35:48] together amen so when you are born again
[1:35:54] the
[1:35:55] soul becomes the
[1:35:58] seat of God in
[1:36:02] the let me say it this way maybe I'll
[1:36:06] say it ahead as we
[1:36:08] go then what
[1:36:11] happens is that when you are called out
[1:36:16] of the temporary capture the devil had
[1:36:19] over you
[1:36:24] in the life
[1:36:26] of then the light gets into the
[1:36:30] soul and the
[1:36:32] Shadows they migrate down into the
[1:36:37] spirit that's where the
[1:36:41] devil you see the shadows live in your
[1:36:44] human Spirit
[1:36:47] area and then you have five gats
[1:36:52] there the
[1:36:55] affection
[1:37:01] affection amen that's now the choices of
[1:37:06] Life the devil sits right there to keep
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] say and then you look at it
[1:37:19] affection
[1:37:21] conscious that things that that awaken
[1:37:24] your
[1:37:27] interest amen you see that's now where
[1:37:31] the Shadows operate
[1:37:34] from the
[1:37:36] memory the negative Paths of
[1:37:41] life where you smoked from where you
[1:37:44] drunk from the night clubs you
[1:37:47] attended
[1:37:50] mem those are shadows
[1:37:53] in the cycle
[1:37:56] reason the way you choose to
[1:38:00] think amen
[1:38:04] imagination the meditations of your
[1:38:09] human you know
[1:38:12] devil gets right there so the Shadows
[1:38:17] then they begin to brew
[1:38:21] forth in the last of the
[1:38:24] eye the last of the
[1:38:27] flesh the pride of
[1:38:31] life okay so these
[1:38:34] Shadows are the
[1:38:36] Flesh in
[1:38:39] battle against the attributes of God in
[1:38:47] your and then you have those
[1:38:50] battles if you really do not know
[1:38:54] you may
[1:38:55] think that you are not a child of
[1:38:59] God but remember
[1:39:05] luk a
[1:39:09] while so brother Bram preaches the
[1:39:12] message the greatest B ever
[1:39:17] fall and he says if countries are going
[1:39:20] to
[1:39:21] fight they choose
[1:39:24] a neutral ground where they can put the
[1:39:29] battle and your human spirit is a
[1:39:33] neutral
[1:39:36] ground that's where unbelief
[1:39:39] Le hallelujah hallelujah and then all
[1:39:42] these
[1:39:44] Temptations they br right in
[1:39:46] there that's why Paul says here in
[1:39:50] Galatians 5:17
[1:39:53] for the
[1:39:55] flesh against the spirit of
[1:40:00] God and the spirit of God against the
[1:40:05] Flesh and these are contrary the one to
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:09] other so that he cannot do the things
[1:40:12] that he would
[1:40:15] do that's the greatest
[1:40:18] but it bruis on the inside of you
[1:40:23] and you'll win this
[1:40:26] battle by believing what God says about
[1:40:30] you and
[1:40:33] you amen yes sir that's how we
[1:40:38] overcome let us go into Romans
[1:40:42] 12 and verse one
[1:40:44] here look at it to renew your
[1:40:49] mind you have to have something
[1:40:53] your
[1:40:55] mind to overcome in this
[1:40:58] batt Amen in Romans 12
[1:41:03] verse1 I besek you therefore
[1:41:07] Brethren by the meres of
[1:41:10] God that you present your bodies a
[1:41:13] Living
[1:41:16] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:41:19] God which is your reasonable service
[1:41:24] meaning that you must deny your
[1:41:29] body not to become the agent of the
[1:41:32] Fallen
[1:41:35] Spirit are you together with me you say
[1:41:39] no I have plac it upon the

[2:19:56] an and when we called the
[2:20:00] neighbors all their phones were
[2:20:03] on we learned not to switch
[2:20:07] them so after the brother spoke to
[2:20:10] me I
[2:20:13] realized that something was not right
[2:20:16] with
[2:20:21] I found
[2:20:23] out that i' had G extremely
[2:20:29] weak and my
[2:20:31] body wouldn't hold
[2:20:34] together I called my

[2:20:53] when I checked the
