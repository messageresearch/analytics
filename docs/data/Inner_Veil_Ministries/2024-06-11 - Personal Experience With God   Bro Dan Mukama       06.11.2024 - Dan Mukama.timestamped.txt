[9:52] Lord let's go to the word straight
[10:05] let's open
[10:14] rans
[10:23] Romans praise the
[10:25] Lord Romans 5
[10:45] okay let's start from verse
[10:48] one the Bible
[10:50] says
[10:53] therefore therefore being justified by
[10:58] faith we have peace with God through our
[11:03] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[11:08] access by faith into his this Grace
[11:13] wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of
[11:17] the glory of God
[11:55] and not only so
[11:59] but we glory in tribulations also
[12:03] knowing that tribulations tribulation
[12:06] work patience and patience experience
[12:10] and
[12:12] experience so
[12:43] [Music]
[12:44] the
[12:46] Lord the Lord add a blessing to the
[12:48] reading of the
[12:51] word we may be
[12:57] seated now
[13:00] I want to thank
[13:02] God for the opportunity the pastors
[13:08] gave stand before the purch of the blood
[13:12] of
[13:22] Christ me all the
[13:26] time to stand before people who the
[13:33] word look at what are going to say what
[13:36] they don't
[13:44] know just depend upon the
[13:49] of to lead us
[13:53] through praise the
[13:55] Lord this evening
[13:58] [Music]
[14:00] uh let's have something very
[14:07] simple yes about the personal experience
[14:11] with
[14:17] God my
[14:20] is the personal experience
[14:26] with amen amen and I know most of
[14:32] us we have heard of
[14:37] God the Lord we have heard
[14:41] about is that
[14:44] right and we have read about
[14:50] him some people have seen
[14:53] Hima the
[14:56] Lord we have seen God in ways
[15:01] praise Lord if you not
[15:07] seen the prophet always
[15:14] says
[15:19] Lord one
[15:23] of the Lord if you are one of
[15:27] them you will receive God
[15:37] and
[15:38] then Jesus
[15:41] said that you will see
[15:45] me but they will
[15:47] not praise the Lord so we have
[15:52] confidence that we
[15:55] see praise the Lord but then that
[16:00] see I want to talk about the
[16:05] experience that you
[16:07] have with the you
[16:11] see praise the Lord personal experience
[16:18] with but here
[16:25] says
[16:27] experience in other words it starts
[16:31] with Paul Paul starts
[16:34] with therefore being
[16:37] just by
[16:45] fath Praise the
[16:47] Lord it is
[16:49] Faith
[16:51] in that
[16:54] Us Praise the Lord if you don't have
[16:58] faith in
[17:02] how can you
[17:05] Beed how will you know
[17:08] him how will you see him if you don't
[17:12] faith in
[17:14] him praise the
[17:16] Lord the Bible starts with being
[17:20] justified by
[17:25] faith have peace with God through our
[17:28] Lord
[17:33] Jesus praise the Lord PA also in
[17:41] Hebrews without
[17:44] faith it is impossible to believe
[17:52] God
[17:54] meaning if you don't have
[17:57] faith then you don't have
[18:01] peace praise the Lord you don't have
[18:04] peace because those who are justified by
[18:08] faith
[18:10] they they have peace with
[18:13] God other God is can easily identify
[18:17] himself with
[18:22] them praise the Lord it is very
[18:25] easy if you have peace with God
[18:30] to unveil himself to
[18:34] you it is very easy to when you have
[18:38] peace with
[18:41] God God can easily unfold himself with
[18:48] you praise the Lord but if you don't
[18:51] have peace with
[18:53] him how can he unveil himself
[18:59] the Lord and then
[19:01] today in this
[19:04] hour in this
[19:07] hour
[19:11] Lord
[19:14] Lord the prophet
[19:16] says he has unveiled himself among the
[19:24] Believers praise the Lord so if you
[19:27] don't have peace with him
[19:30] if you don't have faith in
[19:33] God he can't unfold himself with to
[19:38] you praise the Lord so faith in
[19:44] God him to have peace with
[19:49] you praise the
[19:51] Lord I'm talking about personal
[19:54] experience with
[19:56] God after you have peace with
[20:00] God then by whom also we have access by
[20:14] faith praise the Lord the that we have
[20:20] now came because we have peace with
[20:25] God it came because we first believed
[20:28] God
[20:30] came because we LED
[20:35] God praise the Lord until the writer
[20:40] says I
[20:43] am no longer to
[20:47] linger praise the Lord why don't you
[20:51] linger because you have PE with God why
[20:54] don't you
[20:56] linger you are already in the of
[21:00] God which has made you to
[21:05] stand praise the
[21:06] Lord that makes us to
[21:11] stand praise the
[21:13] Lord once you have peace with
[21:17] God you believe his word and his word
[21:21] rules in your Affairs of
[21:25] Life there no way you can linger
[21:31] praise the Lord there's no way you can
[21:34] linger storms arise in which
[21:39] circumstance you are
[21:43] resed praise the
[21:49] Lord praise the
[21:51] Lord because you have a personal
[21:54] experience with the god whom you serve
[22:00] praise the
[22:01] Lord PA
[22:05] says where in by the grace that we we
[22:08] stand in and rejoice in hope to the
[22:12] glory of
[22:17] God praise the Lord when you see this
[22:20] first one verse and second
[22:29] praise the Lord there are no TR up
[22:34] here you are before
[22:36] God you have peace with him there's no
[22:39] trouble in those two
[22:44] vers praise the Lord in
[22:48] them you have no works
[22:52] there because we are justified by faith
[22:55] not our faith but God's faith
[23:03] praise the Lord so we have no Works in
[23:05] these
[23:07] two then verse
[23:10] comes not only in the first two
[23:15] verses where you have peace with
[23:19] God where you at Comfort
[23:24] zones he says not only so
[23:30] glory in tribs
[23:34] also praise the
[23:37] Lord even though we have peace with God
[23:41] even though God is always at our
[23:45] side that is good but there is time of
[23:49] trition that is
[23:51] coming and knowing that trition work
[23:55] patience
[24:01] allow me to say
[24:03] this
[24:05] God who let it
[24:09] come praise the
[24:11] Lord he is God who let this one
[24:17] come why so that you are
[24:22] patient praise the Lord God can let
[24:26] troubles come
[24:29] you are
[24:31] patient praise the Lord and when
[24:34] patience
[24:37] comes God will say wow then that's
[24:41] good that
[24:43] patience when it has
[24:46] come then it is going to
[24:50] bring it's going to bring
[24:55] experience praise the Lord
[24:58] of
[25:02] God bring experience in
[25:07] God and when experience
[25:10] comes then you have hope for
[25:15] God praise the Lord going have hope in
[25:21] God even though God told us the Rapture
[25:24] is coming
[25:28] because of the experience you have with
[25:32] him you hope for
[25:35] it praise the Lord you're going to hope
[25:38] for
[25:39] it praise the Lord and that
[25:43] hope does not make somebody get
[25:48] asham praise the
[25:53] Lord praise the
[25:55] Lord the experience of God you're going
[25:58] through
[26:00] it can't make you get ashamed to share
[26:02] it outside of other
[26:07] people praise the Lord just like putting
[26:10] on
[26:15] longes praise the Lord just like not
[26:18] putting on
[26:21] lipsticks
[26:23] baching I don't think people ashamed of
[26:25] not doing those things
[26:29] praise the Lord if they are not
[26:33] ashamed even putting on
[26:36] trousers I don't think people ashamed of
[26:39] not putting
[26:42] on praise the Lord but then do the same
[26:48] do the
[26:50] same as you tell the people that you put
[26:52] on wrong dresses
[26:58] I'm
[26:59] saying if putting on trousers doesn't
[27:02] ashame
[27:04] somebody if not putting on
[27:10] to if it is
[27:14] notam then let the word the message that
[27:17] we
[27:19] believe be the same also to put in the
[27:22] forward of the
[27:26] unbelievers praise the Lord
[27:28] because you're not
[27:31] ashamed that experience with God do not
[27:35] asame
[27:36] you praise the Lord and I tell you
[27:40] this anybody who has that
[27:44] experience they going to fight
[27:48] you the Lord they going to fight you
[27:51] they going to oppose you but that
[27:54] doesn't mean is not the will of God
[27:59] praise the Lord those oppositions have
[28:03] come tribs have
[28:06] come to work
[28:10] patience and after the
[28:14] patience after
[28:18] experience and after the
[28:21] hope then you can't be
[28:25] ashamed praise the Lord
[28:28] anybody with the experience of
[28:32] God can't be ashamed of
[28:36] it praise the Lord you can't be ashamed
[28:40] of that experience of
[28:41] God unless you don't know what you
[28:46] have praise the
[28:48] Lord now tribulations in this
[28:53] case may refer to physical hardships
[28:58] [Music]
[29:03] sufferings
[29:06] distresses that we go
[29:08] through praise the Lord but that way
[29:14] Slowly by
[29:15] slowly we begin to gain
[29:18] [Music]
[29:21] experience
[29:22] with if we only can realize
[29:28] all what we are going
[29:30] through it is the working of
[29:33] God praise the Lord if you see that God
[29:37] is working things in your
[29:41] life your attentiveness or your intent
[29:45] or your
[29:47] attention should draw on what does God
[29:50] want me through all
[29:54] this you not those marks
[29:59] no why you not out the working of
[30:02] God you develop experience with
[30:07] God praise the Lord you start experience
[30:11] with
[30:13] God when circumstances
[30:16] come sometimes to try
[30:19] you you don't
[30:22] fall praise the
[30:24] Lord like PA
[30:26] says God has has never allowed a trial
[30:29] to come upon his
[30:35] children is beyond their
[30:38] stand praise the Lord why he first puts
[30:43] you on
[30:45] trial test
[30:47] you that whenever trial
[30:51] comes God is
[30:53] confident that my child
[30:58] will have
[30:59] hope and will not be ashamed of my
[31:02] experience that I've shown
[31:06] him and after
[31:08] that the of
[31:11] God will make you go through
[31:15] that praise the
[31:17] Lord
[31:19] sometimes we narrate
[31:23] situations and then we don't know how
[31:25] things would have gone if you were there
[31:33] praise the Lord sometimes weend and say
[31:36] oh I wish I was there I wish I was
[31:41] Joseph the truth is if
[31:47] you look at howar yourself on Facebook
[31:51] or
[31:55] Whatsapp Facebook if you like to look on
[32:01] women you wouldn't
[32:04] Escape woman's wife if were

[32:13] looking naked women all women who put
[32:22] on if's wife would come to make you go
[32:26] with her
[32:31] I don't think you
[32:33] esap because is
[32:38] there praise the Lord so don't wish to
[32:42] be like
[32:44] Joseph if youe the word
[32:50] now don't wish to be like
[32:53] Joseph if you can't respect God even
[32:56] when the pastors are not with
[33:03] you there for jph to tell him that that
[33:07] wife is not
[33:11] yours the
[33:14] Lord was
[33:15] alone but because of the experience that
[33:19] him to go
[33:21] through when such circumstances
[33:25] came he was so
[33:29] praise the Lord and he used the
[33:31] experience of
[33:33] God to over that
[33:37] woman praise the
[33:40] Lord the
[33:43] Lord let's go to Psalms I've always
[33:46] wanted David all in my sermons I love

[34:02] scenario
[34:04] that words passed

[34:17] Lord words passed
[34:20] around that David wants to overtake
[34:23] Soul's throne

[35:57] they went to seek
[35:59] David while they were

[38:09] your they going to check why this place
[38:12] has a
[38:13] door what is inside
[38:16] here they going to check every corner
[38:19] which you think you don't have any
[38:21] threat for
[38:25] it why is that thing
[38:29] there
[38:31] to but when he comes
[38:35] here
[38:44] be if they get scar of
[38:48] you they will put you out even though
[38:50] you are a
[38:54] member so I wonder these gods of soul
[39:05] president praise the Lord they entered
[39:08] the enemy's
[39:10] territory what is
[39:13] interesting the men of
[39:18] David another verse the men of
[39:21] David they
[39:25] told behold
[39:28] the day which the Lord said unto
[39:32] thee behold I deliver th enemy into
[39:38] th that thou may do to him as it shall
[39:43] seem
[39:46] good
[39:49] isav and the people reminded about the
[39:55] word which God told him
[39:58] that when your enemy
[40:00] comes williver him in your
[40:04] hands it is upon you to do right before
[40:11] you that was David the word of God had
[40:14] mared
[40:16] him praise the Lord but then what
[40:21] happens praise the Lord what
[40:25] happened praise the Lord
[40:32] is and it came to pass verse
[40:35] five that
[40:39] after
[40:41] afterwards that David's heart
[40:45] him because he had cut off
[40:53] Soul praise the Lord now just imagine if
[40:56] you had killed him
[41:00] praise the Lord because just cutting off
[41:02] the of this
[41:05] man it convicted
[41:07] him praise the Lord so in other words
[41:12] the heart that SM
[41:14] him he remembered that God knows how to
[41:19] answer
[41:23] words praise the Lord even though he
[41:26] told to go do whatever you want to your
[41:32] people first get
[41:35] wisdom praise the Lord otherwise if you
[41:38] lack
[41:40] wisdom you may do something that will be
[41:43] aice to the
[41:46] Lord the
[41:47] word to do
[41:51] it praise the Lord that's why many
[41:55] people how to to ask funny questions to
[42:03] Believers and yet finally they are not
[42:06] even in the courts they ask
[42:11] them praise the Lord can tell
[42:15] you show me a
[42:17] message where the Prophet gets women to
[42:21] young
[42:27] it's not
[42:28] there praise the Lord
[42:31] but God works with
[42:37] hiss praise the Lord that's why any that
[42:42] you
[42:44] doible says is there no Among
[42:50] Us Praise the
[42:52] Lord they ask they bring
[42:55] qutes and bring them to a
[43:00] situation may
[43:04] for praise the Lord but yet the word of
[43:09] God at that
[43:15] spot brought the enemy
[43:19] David never told him to
[43:24] K however I told him
[43:27] him in your hands whatever you want to
[43:30] do do
[43:33] it but even cutting off the of the
[43:40] King was not
[43:43] atace praise the
[43:46] Lord then if he him what
[43:51] would praise the
[43:53] Lord as
[43:55] Believers we should to develop a
[43:58] personal experience with
[44:03] God
[44:04] experience it will always teach us it
[44:08] always give us a new revelation of the
[44:10] word of God at that
[44:15] State praise the Lord otherwise you
[44:18] think what defend
[44:21] you even when the pastor knows it is he
[44:24] will say is true
[44:30] that's your
[44:31] mentality but the experience of
[44:34] God given people a good
[44:41] testimony praise the Lord anybody who
[44:44] had got experience of
[44:48] God the testimonies have always been
[44:54] right praise the Lord that's why when we
[44:57] read about
[45:00] David were trials he was going
[45:05] through your
[45:07] enemy is not tell you to kill
[45:11] him praise the Lord maybe has brought
[45:15] the
[45:16] enemy that by your
[45:20] patience you serve the
[45:25] person but then for you
[45:29] cing the Lord so God knows how to bring
[45:33] things in
[45:36] order that's why I I feel
[45:40] like whatever thing that we go
[45:44] through that comes to
[45:48] us
[45:51] or Be
[45:54] watchful God is always behind those
[45:56] things
[45:59] praise the Lord God is always behind
[46:03] those
[46:05] things praise the
[46:07] Lord they would
[46:11] come praise the Lord because God is
[46:14] always watchful over
[46:17] us God is always careful with our
[46:22] life otherwise he wouldn't die for us
[46:27] praise the Lord so the experience of God
[46:33] hereid learned and got a very good
[46:37] testimony in this in this
[46:42] case praise the Lord I don't want to
[46:45] read the whole chapter you read
[46:48] it but these
[46:52] lasts
[46:54] verse the Bible says
[46:57] [Music]
[46:59] now this is the enemy who is
[47:02] testifying was
[47:05] testifying you first go to verse
[47:12] 18 thou Hast showed this day how that
[47:15] thou Hast dealt with me for as much as
[47:19] when the Lord had delivered me into
[47:22] thine hand thou killest me not that was
[47:26] so
[47:40] praise the Lord another and then it
[47:43] says for if a man finds his
[47:48] enemy will he let him go
[47:57] look at the enemy
[47:59] testify because for
[48:01] David God was with him
[48:05] so the spirit of evil was upon
[48:09] him but if David used to
[48:21] kill wouldn't be any testimony
[48:25] this how I enemies tesy about
[48:35] us these are real
[48:38] Believers you
[48:42] find the with
[48:52] unbeliever with your musim neighbors
[48:58] when they about their
[49:06] husbands they talking F
[49:09] [Music]
[49:11] children bring your children in that
[49:13] [Music]
[49:15] mtim
[49:19] there even Believers
[49:23] nowadays they don't fear to climb up to
[49:26] pastors
[49:32] how that is like you know you don't fear
[49:35] to even speak such a thing to a
[49:39] pastor where is that
[49:41] testimony because such a good
[49:46] way you are
[49:48] stumbling now if some wanted to kill
[49:53] you praise the Lord someone want to kill
[49:57] you somebody at peace with
[50:01] you again you somebody for
[50:08] nothing the way he
[50:10] speaks the way
[50:12] Hees but what problem is
[50:16] that now if I have come with a spear to
[50:21] spear how how much would you
[50:25] speak praise the
[50:28] he wanted to be
[50:29] killed David wased to be
[50:33] killed and for him he showed kindness
[50:36] and then after
[50:38] that is telling
[50:40] him in other words he's telling him what
[50:44] heev that for me if I find my
[50:48] enemy the truth
[50:52] isav in there
[50:56] that anger he had in the coming of
[51:00] the was
[51:02] dead praise the Lord that's why he's
[51:06] telling him can a
[51:09] man let him go well
[51:14] with
[51:18] meise Lord
[51:24] but the
[51:33] th who is
[51:38] blessing
[51:44] en praise the
[51:46] Lord so the experience of
[51:50] God it has a good testimony at the end
[51:52] of
[51:54] the praise the Lord
[51:57] every other time whenever there is a
[52:00] good
[52:02] testimony there has been an experience
[52:08] OFA the
[52:10] Lord the
[52:12] Lord you know one thing I I learned from
[52:16] here once you have an experience with
[52:20] God it will be
[52:23] easy for you to learn how to deal with
[52:34] praise the Lord that's what I learned
[52:36] from here it's very easy once you have
[52:39] the experience of
[52:42] God
[52:45] with even when they are in
[52:49] the praise the Lord why brother Bram
[52:53] says this statement
[52:56] I
[52:57] believe God's
[53:00] children is scattered out
[53:07] everywhere theyed
[53:12] everywhere children are scattered out
[53:14] out
[53:17] there and then he says in
[53:21] another even though they are
[53:24] scattered are brothers
[53:28] we may we may dis this is the prophet
[53:30] I'm quoting we may disagree upon
[53:34] different
[53:37] things are still brothers and
[53:41] sisters we love each
[53:44] other when the love of God is in our
[53:48] hearts and the prophet says even being
[53:52] enemies
[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] this is what David had
[54:00] got even being
[54:04] enemies as if we would have
[54:09] any we which we have probably which we
[54:13] are
[54:15] probably we have them praise the Lord
[54:17] but still we love them
[54:23] [Music]
[54:26] no matter what what no matter what of
[54:30] estate they are
[54:32] in they are God
[54:36] children so if they
[54:39] children and you C
[54:42] them are you a child of
[54:47] God because if these are God's
[54:50] children also a child of
[54:53] God the prophet says
[54:58] he says these
[55:00] words there is something about God's
[55:05] children they know one
[55:09] another this is another
[55:12] message so if the other people are God's
[55:16] children also a child of
[55:18] God and you
[55:20] meet the prophet says there is
[55:24] something not in that message there is
[55:27] something about God's
[55:31] children what is that
[55:34] something they know one
[55:38] another in other words they deal with
[55:41] one another
[55:48] as
[55:49] with children of God so there something
[55:53] about the children of God
[55:58] they know one another something that's
[56:01] always
[56:03] been they know one
[56:05] another praise the Lord so even though
[56:09] people tend to act as
[56:13] enemies and they make you to go through
[56:18] tribulations even though they are
[56:20] believers one thing you
[56:24] remember not
[56:28] so no Romans 5 verse not
[56:33] only praise the
[56:35] Lord not only
[56:38] so
[56:40] but Romans 5 of you know not only
[56:46] so so I'm saying
[56:50] INE these children of God tend to act
[56:53] like enemies
[56:58] what you
[56:59] remember not only
[57:01] so but we also glory in tribs
[57:06] [Music]
[57:09] also that tribution you are going
[57:13] through
[57:15] patience and that
[57:18] patience that trition another
[57:21] verse works even experience
[57:27] [Music]
[57:28] work
[57:30] experience it also bring
[57:32] hope when hope
[57:35] comes when
[57:38] comes make us not
[57:42] ashamed praise the Lord so meaning that
[57:45] experience you have with
[57:48] God can make you ashamed even to put it
[57:51] on your stus
[57:56] praise the Lord you can't be
[57:59] ashamed praise the
[58:02] Lord one
[58:04] time
[58:06] so you
[58:08] know I don't know one
[58:11] time so I mean
[58:18] David comes a
[58:21] scario that the brothers are stumbled in
[58:25] the battle
[58:29] and the truth is they didn't have Hope
[58:33] of Victory
[58:35] there praise the Lord were
[58:40] tented
[58:46] what were children
[58:48] of
[58:50] and
[58:53] andum they don't know what to do
[58:57] they until even the chief captain saw
[59:02] himself the Bible says was greatly
[59:07] afraid but then the captain is
[59:15] afraid praise the Lord if the Great
[59:19] Captain has feared
[59:27] praise the
[59:28] Lord what
[59:30] happened since they were God's
[59:41] childrenfor praise the Lord God didn't
[59:44] leave them
[59:48] comfortless praise the Lord what
[59:51] happened he made the Father's Heart
[59:56] to to know what
[1:00:03] going while he sends David in
[1:00:08] battle he didn't tell
[1:00:14] David if your brothers are
[1:00:19] stumbled the father had nothing in him
[1:00:23] for that
[1:00:26] but
[1:00:28] him the experience he had with that
[1:00:33] Shing he
[1:00:35] knew all
[1:00:37] times we Face
[1:00:41] battles so he didn't leave his weap
[1:00:47] back he carried f with a
[1:00:51] shrink but he didn't know he's going to
[1:00:53] fight anybody there
[1:00:56] so that gives us a lesson as
[1:01:01] believer though we are Living
[1:01:04] Church make sure you are
[1:01:08] equipped even though you living your
[1:01:12] houses make sure you are
[1:01:15] equipped
[1:01:16] otherwise between your home and your
[1:01:19] house your home and where you're
[1:01:22] going so many things that will dis
[1:01:28] you praise the Lord but you the weap
[1:01:41] back to
[1:01:43] beat going to fight
[1:01:45] with praise the Lord so we are meant to
[1:01:49] be
[1:01:52] equipped equipped with a string
[1:01:56] went to the
[1:01:59] battlefield neither did the father first
[1:02:01] trained him that you know when you meet
[1:02:02] a certain man you he
[1:02:12] never he brought a young
[1:02:15] lion and he he sh it he brought a young
[1:02:19] bear he it let me tell you
[1:02:24] this what things we go
[1:02:28] through if
[1:02:30] they when things
[1:02:33] are make sure you understand and listen
[1:02:37] and
[1:02:41] watch God is training you for a certain
[1:02:46] thing he will not tell
[1:02:49] you not tell you fight a certain big
[1:02:53] thing
[1:02:56] first wants to bring a certain thing in
[1:02:58] your
[1:03:02] level see where do you draw your
[1:03:08] confidence where is your
[1:03:11] fa praise the
[1:03:13] Lord David he in the battle
[1:03:17] now the
[1:03:21] people no
[1:03:23] movements no shaking things
[1:03:27] was
[1:03:29] why
[1:03:31] quiet the brothers came
[1:03:36] Fu who sent you
[1:03:38] here you man who brought you in
[1:03:43] B before brings a
[1:03:47] statement what have you done come
[1:03:51] to go go go they took the food and they
[1:03:54] just him
[1:03:56] you see people with the ration of
[1:04:00] God
[1:04:03] experience you them here they bring
[1:04:07] another the
[1:04:10] other look at Joseph
[1:04:15] the he became a prime minister the
[1:04:19] other prime minister praise the Lord
[1:04:23] this is a man with God is experience
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:33] people
[1:04:40] hish came toize his
[1:04:45] life come and with me he had a
[1:04:50] focus he never turned to
[1:04:54] such praise the
[1:04:57] happened he went to the
[1:05:00] throne so let me tell you
[1:05:03] this God has always ordered our plans
[1:05:07] even before we start getting
[1:05:13] them God always made our he has always
[1:05:18] made our
[1:05:23] Destinies even before we even started
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:28] Lord Here Comes
[1:05:31] Joseph but they F
[1:05:34] him
[1:05:35] soav by the of
[1:05:38] God they say go back
[1:05:42] home he didn't
[1:05:46] go because the prophet says he was a rud
[1:05:49] man
[1:05:56] I don't know which word
[1:05:58] but
[1:05:59] something you know what
[1:06:02] happen and went to one of the
[1:06:05] servants
[1:06:07] come
[1:06:09] here they said there's a man you there
[1:06:12] man
[1:06:21] there then was
[1:06:23] like what will be
[1:06:26] on the man who
[1:06:33] that it was in The Experience he had
[1:06:36] with
[1:06:38] God praise the Lord The Experience he
[1:06:42] had with God in the in the
[1:06:46] field the one that
[1:06:49] sh
[1:06:51] G praise the Lord because what did he
[1:06:55] start with
[1:06:57] they brought him before
[1:06:59] theing I'm going to
[1:07:02] that the king
[1:07:04] said you present an experience
[1:07:10] here have you fought in
[1:07:15] battle you a man this man even testified
[1:07:19] to
[1:07:28] this man has fought battles once when he
[1:07:31] was a
[1:07:33] youth and has defeated
[1:07:37] him praise the Lord but David said it's
[1:07:42] okay but I also have an
[1:07:46] experience what
[1:07:48] happened when I was keeping my father's
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:53] flock shim
[1:07:56] came and I
[1:07:59] it was not enough to
[1:08:04] fight
[1:08:11] talking this
[1:08:14] Manar he
[1:08:17] has with it
[1:08:26] not that enough David
[1:08:28] now he was telling the king that's not
[1:08:31] enough
[1:08:37] also talking about people with wisdom
[1:08:40] you're bringing
[1:08:47] about the Lord an
[1:08:51] animal you can put some small small food
[1:08:55] there
[1:08:57] but yet you have trapped
[1:09:00] it in it it lands in the
[1:09:05] TR man go through
[1:09:08] that praise the Lord
[1:09:13] Man by the time
[1:09:16] heed
[1:09:19] up testimonies were about animals
[1:09:25] who was there to watch him do
[1:09:29] that praise the
[1:09:31] Lord
[1:09:37] people
[1:09:43] knew the
[1:09:45] Lord The Experience he
[1:09:50] had God by
[1:09:53] Grace he was at peace with
[1:09:57] praise the Lord The Experience he
[1:10:01] had it was at peace
[1:10:05] with then why stand
[1:10:10] behind praise the Lord he
[1:10:14] said God who delivered
[1:10:18] me praise the Lord so
[1:10:22] meaning David is not the one who who
[1:10:25] fought those
[1:10:27] things it was God working him through
[1:10:31] it praise the
[1:10:34] Lord praise the Lord even us whatever we
[1:10:38] are going
[1:10:39] through not down the experience you got
[1:10:42] through
[1:10:45] it one time it will be
[1:10:50] exam praise the Lord whatever we go
[1:10:53] through
[1:10:55] the experience that we go
[1:10:59] through praise the Lord because at the
[1:11:02] end of the
[1:11:04] day be an
[1:11:08] ex praise the Lord praise the so the
[1:11:12] prophet says I read the
[1:11:15] prophet and there was AUD
[1:11:19] David just a youth with his little sheep
[1:11:23] coat wrapped around him
[1:11:28] walked up into the face of those
[1:11:32] pharohs made them ashamed of
[1:11:36] themselves praise the Lord he made them
[1:11:40] ashamed you
[1:11:43] captains you
[1:11:46] armies can one
[1:11:49] man def the arm of
[1:11:53] God praise the Lord
[1:11:56] and he
[1:11:57] said you stand
[1:11:59] there the trained Army of the Living
[1:12:06] God the
[1:12:13] of Praise the Lord so what
[1:12:16] happens even us sometimes we make
[1:12:28] praise the Lord sometimes let the def
[1:12:36] us why we are trained of
[1:12:41] God praise the lord we have the
[1:12:45] word and the word is
[1:12:48] powerful so why do we stand before
[1:12:52] G let him def us
[1:12:58] what
[1:12:58] happens The Experience he had with
[1:13:03] God he said I will go fight him
[1:13:20] myself he didn't know where the victory
[1:13:22] will come
[1:13:25] and the experience he
[1:13:28] had made him
[1:13:31] stand brought out a good
[1:13:35] testimony praise the
[1:13:38] Lord then the prophet
[1:13:40] says so verse 41
[1:13:45] so know nothing about
[1:13:50] that what happens 41 verse so know
[1:13:55] nothing about
[1:13:59] that praise the Lord and then what
[1:14:03] happens you have Pastor so he know
[1:14:06] nothing about
[1:14:08] that so he went to church
[1:14:14] everyb I wish we see the things quickly
[1:14:17] because you know he even though sa went
[1:14:20] to church every Sabbath verse 41
[1:14:27] the prophet says he have done all
[1:14:30] religious
[1:14:31] things he may have done all religious
[1:14:37] things praise the Lord and then what
[1:14:42] happens he
[1:14:44] says that the rest of them
[1:14:51] done the point you have passed
[1:14:59] he have done
[1:15:02] all
[1:15:04] things the of them
[1:15:09] done he never he had never had an
[1:15:15] experience so you can't fight glor
[1:15:18] without
[1:15:21] experience you can't fight the enemies
[1:15:25] without the experience of
[1:15:28] God
[1:15:29] how praise the Lord after
[1:15:34] enemies they eat strong food like you
[1:15:40] eat and some of
[1:15:42] them go to
[1:15:48] witcraft you turn to God
[1:15:51] then praise the Lord because
[1:15:56] depend on God's
[1:15:59] experience to
[1:16:01] meet he was very
[1:16:04] confident me go and fight him
[1:16:08] myself and verse 42
[1:16:11] says it says and what
[1:16:16] happened David said when I was standing
[1:16:20] my father's
[1:16:23] ship now this are
[1:16:27] testimonies out
[1:16:30] there then I wish I see this he says
[1:16:34] what
[1:16:35] happened says when I was Turing my
[1:16:37] father's
[1:16:40] sheep out
[1:16:43] there when I looked down to the Green
[1:16:50] Pastures praise the Lord and by the
[1:16:54] still
[1:16:56] Waters I Lear I learned of a
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:05] God who made the heavens and the
[1:17:08] Earth praise the Lord that's what he
[1:17:12] saying praise the Lord in other words he
[1:17:17] had an
[1:17:18] experience to see what God would
[1:17:22] do therefore he know that experience
[1:17:27] would carry him on to
[1:17:31] Victory praise the Lord so I want to
[1:17:35] finish here by
[1:17:38] saying
[1:17:45] then praise the
[1:17:53] Lord praise the Lord so he says go tell
[1:17:57] my servant
[1:17:59] David I know he was just a little rude
[1:18:03] thing I know he was wearing a ship
[1:18:10] coat but I took him away from the ship
[1:18:14] coat and a ruler of my
[1:18:19] people like the great men in the Earth
[1:18:25] praise the Lord how God that sincerity
[1:18:29] of Faith to believe
[1:18:35] him praise the Lord saw the experience
[1:18:39] of God in
[1:18:41] David upon that
[1:18:46] experience God made him
[1:18:49] AER now to us now
[1:18:55] where there is
[1:18:58] unbelief
[1:19:01] move praise the Lord where there is
[1:19:05] unbelief can't do any
[1:19:08] work because the B clearly
[1:19:12] says never many miracles
[1:19:18] anywhere because of their
[1:19:21] unbelief praise the Lord he never need
[1:19:24] anything
[1:19:26] because of their
[1:19:28] un praise the Lord but then to
[1:19:32] us Psalms
[1:19:35] 119 and verse 59 it says verse 1 I mean
[1:19:41] verse
[1:19:45] 59 verse
[1:19:47] 59 you know as to us
[1:19:52] Believers when we think on our
[1:19:57] ways which ways the ways that we have
[1:20:01] taken off the word
[1:20:05] of when we think upon
[1:20:08] them having heard the word of
[1:20:12] godav says when I thought on my
[1:20:17] ways and turned my feetto testimonies
[1:20:25] praise the
[1:20:26] Lord when we check and find out our
[1:20:32] ways they are notching the
[1:20:40] word David advises
[1:20:43] us
[1:20:46] Toto the ways that have the testimonies
[1:20:49] of
[1:20:51] God praise the Lord
[1:20:55] so he says the prophet do few ques then
[1:20:58] we
[1:21:01] close few
[1:21:03] few he
[1:21:05] says check your experience with
[1:21:11] God check your experience with
[1:21:18] God see check your experience with God
[1:21:25] praise the Lord check your experience
[1:21:28] with
[1:21:30] God see if
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:33] something
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] you
[1:21:50] cled on the testimonies that he went
[1:21:52] through
[1:21:56] when God was saving him from a she
[1:21:59] bear when God was saving him from a
[1:22:03] lion he called on
[1:22:06] that that when the enemy
[1:22:09] came he used that
[1:22:12] experience and
[1:22:16] wasal praise the Lord the prophet is
[1:22:19] saying check your experience with God
[1:22:24] if something really has got a hold of
[1:22:30] you that brings you back to this
[1:22:35] word away from Creeds and forms and so
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:43] forth check your
[1:22:47] experience it drives you from the word
[1:22:50] of
[1:22:51] God that experience dries you from the
[1:22:54] word of
[1:22:55] God that experience we
[1:22:58] have if it doesn't agree with the word
[1:23:02] of
[1:23:04] God with thees of
[1:23:09] God from
[1:23:11] that the testimony of the
[1:23:15] Lord testimon matches with the
[1:23:21] word then the testimonies will rise
[1:23:27] and people
[1:23:31] see praise the
[1:23:33] Lord praise the Lord so usually the
[1:23:37] prophet
[1:23:38] says people who have
[1:23:42] faith are people who have
[1:23:47] experience the Lord people have faith in
[1:23:50] the word of
[1:23:53] God people who have
[1:23:57] faith people who have a good
[1:24:01] testimony
[1:24:03] people who are going toote
[1:24:12] theise the Lord that when God wants Tove
[1:24:17] someone in of bringing
[1:24:21] sermons your life alone
[1:24:25] brings a s in the
[1:24:28] church your actions your
[1:24:32] speeches speak the
[1:24:36] people praise the
[1:24:39] Lord praise the
[1:24:45] Lord wow so my last
[1:24:49] statements that's why I
[1:24:51] think in these lessons that we are
[1:24:53] having now
[1:24:58] great thing to the
[1:25:01] church I'm quoting it's a great thing to
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] church because it brings them to a
[1:25:09] place that all
[1:25:13] scriptures tie
[1:25:15] together and our
[1:25:18] experience with God it must tie with the
[1:25:23] with that scripture
[1:25:28] Lord our
[1:25:32] experience with that
[1:25:34] scripture oh here it
[1:25:38] is if it doesn't tie with
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:44] scriptures then it's
[1:25:49] strong praise the
[1:25:51] Lord then it's wrong
[1:25:55] praise the
[1:25:59] Lord he says also the last
[1:26:03] quote what is
[1:26:05] it God is
[1:26:07] word anchored in your
[1:26:11] flesh that gives you eternal life that
[1:26:15] gives you the resurrection
[1:26:18] power to bring you from the things of
[1:26:21] the
[1:26:22] world from the blind traditions of
[1:26:27] men walk in the sunlight of the health
[1:26:31] of
[1:26:35] God that's what the that's what the
[1:26:39] comforter
[1:26:41] does it lifs you out of that
[1:26:46] cellular
[1:26:51] condition it brings you up
[1:26:56] in the presence of
[1:26:59] God you an
[1:27:03] experience praise the
[1:27:05] Lord so when we have the word of
[1:27:09] God and it is anchored in our
[1:27:15] flesh and that word gives us
[1:27:20] Comfort it is that word it's meant Lift
[1:27:25] us
[1:27:27] up into the presence of
[1:27:31] God and gives us an experience with
[1:27:37] God praise the Lord so when that
[1:27:41] experience has
[1:27:43] come we can't sh away from
[1:27:48] it praise the
[1:27:50] Lord may the Lord bless you
