before we get on with the service amen amen do you love him um praise the Lord God bless you if you could see what I once was with me with me about where I started from then I know you would see [Music] [Music] what I am today [Music] by grace [Music] [Music] into my place [Music] [Music] stay by grace [Music] [Music] clay must mind all the features [Music] [Music] [Music] by grace [Music] [Music] every step of life [Music] back with [Music] me I'm just [Music] amen Amina the blood does the washing Messiah that is saved by grace next time we sing it that way I'm no longer sinner I was a sinner that is saved by grace amen Amina let's stand up and get into the teaching of the world this morning foreign let's buy heads in the word of prayer Freedom when he came today from Chicago the great and gracious God the one who has loved us eternally we come before your presence with Thanksgiving that once again you've given us the grace to come under fellowship with you father we humble ourselves as we pray that you may teach our hearts how to walk the work of a new birth give us father dear God Revelation that we may walk thereby today I commit you the needs of the people further that you may deal with them this morning foreign [Music] born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever may the Lord that blessing the reading of his word you may be seated so this morning Angelo we are going to speak on the new birth and its life you see where there is a bus there must be a life to live when you give a bath that does not have a life then we call it a steel bath so you know the new balance and it's life amen Amina so I want to clarify somebody watch the new birth is before we dig into it brother Branham says too many of our modernists [Music] believe in Salvation at a certain specific time which in the many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again now to receive Christ to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy ghosts [Music] [Music] [Music] by the word of God foreign [Music] into their depths in this service so we shall go to John chapter three and this Jesus now the scripture says in John 3 verse that's where we are going this morning amen amen John 3 1 the Holy Spirit says there was a man of the Pharisees no he is so specific here he's saying there was a man of the foreign [Music] it was of the forest s and he was a ruler and to be a rulers [Music] to understand [Music] so we are dealing with a man who is literally indicated in scriptures [Music] so the Bible says the same came to Jesus we know that thou art a teacher come from God from the end of the language so he says [Music] except God be with him now have you seen the angle would you always approaching him as an educator [Music] so in that day [Music] could not come by recognizing Christ as God sent pictures come by recognizing that God has sent us a prophet foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Thunder [Music] amen Amina so brother Branham says one day when Jesus was upon using a certain man came to visit him this man says we know you are a teacher he sent from God but you will notice Jesus and the word is [Music] um I am making it possible for the New Birth by my spirit but the race [Music] who is the teacher he's the Holy Spirit when Jesus was upon the Earth yes and that's the prophet but when he came back upon the church by his Spirit he became a teacher yeah so there are two phases of Jesus Christ that we have to deal with to get into the new birth you must recognize him together as the Lamb of God are you together Lord forgive me Lord take away my sins the same phrase of Christ again foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] the understanding wider yeah [Music] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless except a man is born again he cannot see Chinese [Music] so two great statements [Music] amen are you together you're there for must see are you together with me one is it because in the First National Bank when she was in the garden of Heaven Abdel and Cain ability were born out of Heaven could have been considered the development of the Kingdom of Heaven amen amen but when they sinned in them they were put out of that spot but uh away from the tree of life therefore away from the kingdom is to see the kingdom again and enter into it and in a broader perspective the kingdom of God is the very life of the Holy Ghost foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen so continuing with John chapter three verse 5 says Jesus answered yes very very yeah and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God Amen Amina so born of water and the spirit no more yeah so this water is not the water bathroom you took in this pool that inducts you to The Fellowship of believer because this baptism is are you together with me Brian is it it does not save me so water don't save a man he touched the blood of Jesus Christ there's no life in water comes in the blood cell I mean life comes in the blood cells sanctification to kill the desire of sin the Holy Spirit comes into that clean version [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] are you together with me when is it unless you are born of what and of Spirits [Music] by way of the world let me take you to Ephesians 5 26 that's why Memphis is Ephesians 5 26 therefore might sanctify and he cleanse the church with the washing of water so this water here because foreign [Music] [Music] amen Amina and when you feel the annuity conditions [Music] when the father you started the world when you are trying to conform to the standard of the Holy Spirit when you say that you cannot conform to the world [Music] when you started reading and then you said Lord forgive us when you are being washed by them to make yourself ready to received to complete the New Balance the washing of Water by the word and then the spirit that the word produces the process of the New Balance when something is born without life that is that must project [Music] [Music] [Music] but it's a personal way God is dealing with you as an individual foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no no no no [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is now calling himself a teaching Prophet um are you together with me when is it but how do people call me [Music] he is saying himself by the office that he was using at the time he was a teaching Prophet yeah [Music] Jesus was a prophet yes because by way of verse 14. some families yes [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign amen amen he says you know they said yeah everybody accepts that you are a prophet except that they don't understand which prophet and then he says but I mean he says sending now to a personal revelation have you touched [Music] it's not a general position of our local church teaching foreign [Music] [Music] that's when it comes back yeah are you together with me one is a not accept a church do you commitment individuals the lamp of God and once you get him to see him as the Lamb of God is the revelation of the open door that brings foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that was a revelation Peter God hallelujah that's the Revelation amen amen and he says when you know it brings down the Holy Spirit who wants the Holy Spirit [Music] the son of the Living God [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen Amina foreign [Music] blessed at thou simony badges because flesh and blood has not revealed it until about it has not revealed this to you your pastor can talk about somebody can teach it is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] yes Crystal it's all about Christ Church is not about me it's not about your pride it's not about the bad brother movie it's all centered about the revelation of Christ amen Amina you know sometimes you can get the revelation when I do this we're quality of how bad the people are oh yeah baby but that's not what you need to wait again you need the revelations [Music] by Supernatural Revelations amen amen so the prophet says [Music] he becomes the center yeah whether the past has helped you financially um he says Christ life in you Allah make sure the complete revelation of the world what is the revelation of Jesus Christ foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not what it is there must be a supernatural pain touch your life fast okay if that Supernatural thing never happens then you are trying to make your own salvation if you have not experienced that yet he said but Christ Christian is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it is [Music] so when Christ takes the center of our Lives by Revelation it produces the lights centered around the person of Christ himself is Christ in you they question me away amen the hope of God making you are living your peace amen amen so when the new birth is you've got a command point which has nothing to do with your couch which has nothing to do with your education [Music] and a believing engineer an engineer um they think about their training they are centered around Christo amen Amina you don't have to do anything to prove it amen amen your life proceeds peace [Music] amen Amina it says yeah so it's Christo expressing himself in the individuals whether his intellectuals however I don't know his ABCs have the apostles didn't know it over to me together but they know Christ I am not by the Christian they never taken heat to Peter and John Tibet knowing that they had been out of some Seminary seminaries [Music] Crystal [Music] you understand that's enough that's what the new bathroom that's what I was standing must produce an experience with the Christ or foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] he's saying how you come into this once you are born again you hear the word of Truth are you together once you hear the word of Truth and believe always then what happens right power is not the Holy Spirit who generates every promise so you are still because [Music] [Music] it comes after I believe the word I don't find my way this is where we are we are known here today this is our promise when you feel Born Again amen you can go into the bank of the promises of God can pull out one by one when you are sick by his stripes when you are in trouble even if I walk through the valley of this why do you have that confidence foreign Instagram [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] from Genesis by making yourself alive amen I'm here now so that's the divine revelation amen the word [Music] it is producing its life through us the fruits it's not something we speak English [Music] [Music] so today that was it makes us a tree the bread tree must bear fruit foreign [Music] then you cannot have the number alone brings transformation is the supernatural work of Christ you cannot even explain yourself yes there is something in you oh whenever you're working in my way that creates a form of sweetness you just can't tell it it just keeps producing love but there is a form of peace that you enjoy you start wondering how does this happening amen somebody I'm in our motto amen amen is Christ practically taking over from our abilities that he may make himself alive in us amen Amina I want you to look at this you know brother Branham says you see this is where you really need to submit yourself foreign [Music] you keep saying am I say with all I'm not looking I won't tell you you are in that process some of you are in that process for three and a half years but Jesus help your brothers you are moving with me please so we have got justifications foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so you must know you are touching something Supernatural stages but if you're in the process there is a super loud that links you to that Christ you just [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] but out of the world I am Chicago we must the lamb first together with him amen amen yes sir in this age of Rapid degradation [Music] who was the measure of the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] people on the grounds of joining Church they knew brahmana that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ as today's church is filled with mental Believers [Music] going to church [Music] foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] by faith in the Son of God it was the Faith by the quick result of the Son of God had given him life and kept living in Christian Victory by the Faith of Christ is the spirit of Christ but Christ not living things we come to that level he says no they they had not denied that salvation was Supernatural from start to finish salvations of the Lord from beginning
