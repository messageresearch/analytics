[10:19] we are thankful unto you Lord father for
[10:21] this evening we thank you Lord Jesus for
[10:25] the grace you've given un us father that
[10:28] we can come with your presence Lord you
[10:31] said in your word where two or three are
[10:33] gathered in your name you will be there
[10:36] in their midst and Lord we believe you
[10:38] here in our midst so we pray father may
[10:42] you speak to us may You Deliver Us from
[10:44] all captivity Lord you take away all
[10:48] unbelief and all down make yourself
[10:51] known Us in such special Lord and answer
[10:54] every prayer request Lord meet every
[10:57] needing such special Lord Lord we commit
[11:00] ourselves into your hands For Your Glory
[11:02] and for your honor we also pray for
[11:04] those that to be part of this service
[11:06] Lord we lift them into your hands that
[11:08] your grace May reach unto them we bless
[11:10] your Holy Name forever more in the name
[11:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray ask
[11:15] this amen I greet in the name of Jesus
[11:18] Christ I request we go to our
[11:22] Bibles Hebrews chapter
[11:26] 4 and then verse
[11:29] verse
[11:34] 16 praise the name of our
[11:36] Lord Hebrews
[11:41] 4 verse 14 to verse
[11:47] 16 so the scripture
[11:50] says seeing then that we have a great
[11:53] high priest that is passed into the
[11:56] heavens Jesus the son
[11:59] of God let us hold fast our
[12:14] profession for we have not a high priest
[12:17] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[12:20] of our infirmities but was in all points
[12:23] tempted like as we are yet without
[12:27] sin
[12:43] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[12:46] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[12:49] and find Grace to help in the time of
[12:57] need
[13:06] his word you may be
[13:09] seated I want to preach on the
[13:12] subject you fail by looking at your
[13:17] weaknesses praise the name of our Lord
[13:20] you fail by looking at your
[13:25] weaknesses so here the scripture is
[13:27] telling us in
[13:31] 15 that we have a high
[13:38] priest who is touched with the feeling
[13:42] of our
[13:46] infirmities and he was tested or tempted
[13:50] in all
[13:53] points like we go
[13:55] through so now the scripture here
[13:59] is telling us we have a high
[14:02] priest and he's always
[14:07] touched with the feeling of our
[14:12] infirmities praise the name of our Lord
[14:15] now when you look at that word
[14:19] infirmities you know it is so
[14:23] broad that you know
[14:26] infirmities they mean our body body
[14:31] weaknesses but doesn't stop at our body
[14:35] weaknesses you know like maybe when you
[14:37] are feeling you don't have
[14:40] strength that is an
[14:43] infirmity when you are sick that is an
[14:47] infirmity when you are not able to do
[14:51] something that is also an
[14:54] infirmity but then also
[14:56] infirmities can also come to the
[14:59] spiritual
[15:01] ter that you are not able to do the
[15:04] things of
[15:06] God because of your
[15:09] weaknesses your spiritual
[15:12] weaknesses and then again when you read
[15:14] in the scriptures
[15:16] again
[15:18] weaknesses can also mean when you
[15:24] lack like if you don't have money you
[15:27] know there's a scripture I was reading
[15:29] I was really
[15:31] wondering when we go to Acts
[15:34] 20 and then we read in verse
[15:39] 33 praise the name of our
[15:42] Lords 20 and then verse
[15:47] 33 so the scripture says
[15:51] here I have convered no man silver or
[15:55] gold or
[15:57] ar
[16:06] know that these hands have ministered
[16:08] unto my Necessities unto them that were
[16:12] with
[16:21] me I have shown you all things how that
[16:25] so laboring you ought support the we
[16:29] and to remember the words of the Lord
[16:31] Jesus how he said it is more blessed to
[16:35] give than to
[16:45] receive now you see here is talking
[16:48] about to support the
[16:51] weak but the support of the weak people
[16:53] is talking
[16:56] about the people who don't have
[17:00] maybe they don't have food he's looking
[17:03] at it as weakness maybe they don't have
[17:06] clothes he's looking at it as weakness
[17:09] maybe they don't have accommodation he's
[17:11] looking at it at weakness maybe they
[17:13] don't have money he looking at it as
[17:16] weakness so he saying to learn to
[17:20] work that you support those who are
[17:24] weak and so now we see that according to
[17:28] the
[17:29] scripture weakness takes different
[17:34] dimensions when you lack the scripture
[17:37] talks about us being
[17:40] weak praise the name of our Lord when we
[17:42] go to Romans chapter
[17:45] 14 and then verse
[17:48] one praise the name of our
[17:51] Lord so Romans 14 and then verse
[17:55] one he says him that is weak in the
[17:59] faith receive ye but not to doubtful
[18:06] disputations Romans
[18:26] 14 for one leaveth that he may eat all
[18:30] things another who is weak eateth
[18:40] herbs so now he's talking again about
[18:45] eating that if somebody doesn't eat what
[18:48] you
[18:49] eat you may look at him as being
[18:53] weak and then in verse five one esth one
[18:57] day above the Earth
[18:59] another esth every day alike every man
[19:02] be fully persuaded in his own
[19:19] mind he that the it unto the Lord and He
[19:24] that regardeth not the day to the Lord
[19:27] he does not regard it he that eateth
[19:30] eateth the Lord for he giveth God thanks
[19:33] and he that eateth not to the Lord he
[19:35] eateth not and gives God
[19:53] thanks for none of us liveth to himself
[19:57] and no man dies to
[20:14] himself for whether we live we live unto
[20:17] the Lord and whether we die we die unto
[20:20] the Lord whether we live therefore or
[20:23] die we are the
[20:24] [Music]
[20:27] lordes
[20:39] praise the name of our Lord so then you
[20:41] see that the weaknesses vary from one
[20:45] person to another
[20:49] person praise the name of the Lord in
[20:52] different
[20:54] dimensions it can be your through in the
[20:57] body
[20:59] it may be in the
[21:00] spirit or the conditions that you are
[21:03] subjected
[21:05] to and you see what the devil always
[21:08] wants to
[21:09] do he wants you to always focus on your
[21:14] weaknesses he wants you to put your mind
[21:17] on your
[21:18] weaknesses and then you start judging
[21:22] yourself that me I can't go
[21:25] further praise the name of our Lord and
[21:28] then sometimes we think that when we
[21:31] have some kind of
[21:35] abilities then we are able to do a lot
[21:38] of
[21:39] things and yet sometimes when you think
[21:42] about your
[21:44] abilities then before God it may be
[21:48] contrary to what he's
[21:51] thinking the name of our Lord but in
[21:54] every situation that we are
[21:57] in we are called upon to depend upon the
[22:02] Lord praise the name of our Lord we are
[22:05] called upon to depend upon the
[22:08] Lord now when we go to Jeremiah chapter
[22:12] 9 and then verse
[22:17] 23 Jeremiah 9 and verse
[22:24] 23 the Bible says says the Lord let not
[22:30] the wise man grory in his wisdom neither
[22:33] let the Mighty Man
[22:35] glory in his might let
[22:56] not
[27:38] ability
[27:51] at now you see the contrast
[27:55] here praise the name of our
[27:58] he says when you
[28:00] feel you cannot do
[28:03] anything that's where God Wants You Now
[28:05] to
[28:06] be that God can start using
[28:10] you praise the name of our Lord to LIF
[28:13] you to a higher
[28:16] stage praise the name of our Lord then
[28:19] he says that is right it is when they
[28:22] feel like they
[28:25] can't they haven't got
[28:28] nothing that's when God can take a hold
[28:31] of
[28:33] them and do something with
[28:36] them but when we are
[28:39] thinking that we are able to do
[28:43] it then God can't use
[28:47] us because we are wanting to do it
[28:51] ourselves so then God looks us at us to
[28:54] fully depend upon him
[28:58] you don't start depending upon your
[29:02] abilities you don't start depending upon
[29:05] your
[29:06] skills you don't glory in your
[29:09] abilities you don't glory in your
[29:12] talents but then you need to know Lord
[29:16] I'm here I need you to take me ahead of
[29:19] the praise the name of and that's what
[29:22] God desires of us so then we shouldn't
[29:26] look at our Weck
[29:28] we shouldn't look at our failures but
[29:31] then we need to look to the Lord to help
[29:34] us all the of
[29:36] the praise the name of our Lord don't
[29:39] look at your
[29:41] failures praise the name of our Lord you
[29:43] know the Bible says let the weak
[29:47] say I am strong praise the name of our
[29:51] Lord let the poor say I am rich why I'm
[29:55] not looking at my poverty I'm not
[29:57] looking at my weaknesses I'm not looking
[30:00] at my failures but I'm looking to the
[30:02] almighty God to take all my
[30:06] challenges praise the name of our Lord
[30:08] so that's how God wants to bring us
[30:11] up that you know out of something which
[30:14] is
[30:15] despised out of something that is
[30:18] nothing he wants to get glory for
[30:22] himself praise the name of our Lord so
[30:24] then he continues to
[30:26] say
[30:29] but when we are thinking that we are
[30:30] able to do
[30:33] it then God can't use
[30:36] us because we are wanting to do it
[30:41] ourselves and then the other side we get
[30:45] these
[30:48] feelings and we think that we are
[30:53] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[30:57] but then if we just listen to the call
[31:01] of
[31:02] God that is the very
[31:05] thing that God wants us to get
[31:09] into that kind of a
[31:16] shape when we are
[31:24] insufficient
[31:25] our then are subject to yield to Godly
[31:32] Spirit praise the name of the Lord you
[31:35] know you just say Lord here I
[31:38] am praise the name of the Lord like
[31:41] Ezekiel in the valley of dry
[31:43] bondes he was taken and so the bones are
[31:47] scattered and then the spirit told him
[31:50] son man can these bones
[31:53] live then he was amazed how can these
[31:56] things which are part
[31:58] this then said you know Lord he was just
[32:02] depending upon the Lord then the Lord
[32:04] said do this say this then he would say
[32:08] it and then the bones Join one another
[32:11] there speak again this way so he was
[32:14] honestly depending upon God to bring
[32:18] something
[32:19] glorious out of nothing praise the name
[32:22] of our Lord and that's how the Lord also
[32:24] wants to use us that's how the Lord
[32:27] wants to lead Our
[32:29] Lives that's how the Lord wants to take
[32:31] over each and every one of our Lives
[32:33] when we can surrend Lord here I am on my
[32:37] own I can do
[32:38] nothing praise the name of our Lord so
[32:41] then when we
[32:43] continue he says but when we get to a
[32:46] place where we know we can't we can't do
[32:51] it then we yield ourselves to
[32:55] God and he does it
[32:57] so then if it is us trying to do
[33:01] it we will fail but if we just yield
[33:08] our unto God then God cannot
[33:13] fail praise the name of our Lord that's
[33:16] why the Bible says cast all your
[33:20] burdens the Lord he can't fail why do
[33:24] you want to car your BD by yourself
[33:27] why do you want to call your Lord by
[33:29] yourself why don't you take that burden
[33:33] and then put it to the Lord praise the
[33:35] name of the Lord you know like that song
[33:38] bigger than all my
[33:39] problems bigger than Every Mountain
[33:43] praise the name of our Lord you just
[33:45] call upon him and then he will take over
[33:48] the whole St praise the name of our Lord
[33:52] then he
[33:53] says so as long as we are trying to
[33:56] trying in
[33:59] ourselves and depending on our own
[34:03] abilities and fall
[34:06] forth
[34:07] well we do
[34:10] nothing but when we get to a
[34:13] place where we know we are
[34:16] nothing then God can use Us Praise the
[34:20] name of our Lord it teaches us to
[34:24] surrender you know in your own life and
[34:26] say Lord you've created me Lord you've
[34:29] made me Lord I'm facing so many
[34:32] challenges I call upon you to come in
[34:34] this of I call upon you to come in this
[34:38] weakness that I have you are honestly
[34:40] depending upon God and you're not
[34:43] depending upon your
[34:45] abili then he says the important thing
[34:49] one of the important things that we must
[34:51] we must
[34:54] Master remember this espe espcially you
[34:57] young
[34:59] preachers and L members
[35:02] alike there is one thing that we've got
[35:05] to
[35:06] master if we have to expect fulfill
[35:09] God's desire in our
[35:13] life that is we have to
[35:17] master the thought of human
[35:21] ability if we ever get to a
[35:24] spot where we think that we can do it
[35:27] with with our own
[35:31] intelligence our own
[35:34] abilities we got to
[35:36] master that in such a
[35:39] way we can get rid of the
[35:43] thing and lay it
[35:45] aside so that God can use
[35:50] us depending upon God not your abilities
[35:55] not your intelligence
[35:57] not your skills but just asking Lord
[36:00] come and guide me praise the name of our
[36:03] Lord and make a complete
[36:07] surrender go we cannot use one
[36:12] ability we got to make a complete
[36:16] surrender and to come to God you've got
[36:20] surrender to him both soul body and
[36:25] spirit
[36:27] everything that you
[36:29] are has to be surrendered to
[36:32] God in order that he can
[36:37] work his will in you and
[36:42] me praise the name of the Lord just
[36:45] total dependence upon God toal surrender
[36:48] to God praise the name of our Lord now
[36:52] let us go to Isaiah chter
[36:55] 53 and then we read from verse
[37:01] one so the Bible says who has believed
[37:05] our report to whom is the arm of the
[37:08] Lord revealed for you shall grow up
[37:10] before him as a tender plant and as a
[37:14] root out of a dry ground he has no form
[37:17] nor cess and when we shall see him there
[37:20] is no beauty that we desired
[37:25] him
[37:50] praise the name of our
[37:52] Lord let us continue in verse
[37:55] three
[37:57] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[38:01] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[38:04] we hid as to wear our faces from him he
[38:07] was despised and we esteemed him
[38:25] not
[38:41] Sur has born our griefs and carried our
[38:45] sorrows yet we did a steem stream
[38:48] stricken smitten of God and
[38:55] afflicted
[39:10] but he was wounded for our
[39:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[39:14] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[39:17] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[39:25] healed
[39:37] and all we like sheep have gone astray
[39:40] we have turned everyone to his own way
[39:43] and the lord has laid on him the
[39:45] iniquity of us
[39:55] all
[40:01] praise the name of the Lord a very
[40:03] interesting story
[40:06] here that
[40:08] Christ came and took over all our
[40:14] weaknesses praise the name of the Lord
[40:17] he came and took over all our
[40:21] infirmities the Bible says he is
[40:24] despised and rejected of
[40:27] so if you are
[40:29] rejected if you are
[40:31] despised Christ took that
[40:34] place praise the name of our Lord then
[40:37] the Bible says he is a Man of
[40:41] Sorrows you talk about the Sorrows that
[40:43] you have you talk about the pains that
[40:47] you have you talk about the strations
[40:49] you go through the Bible says Christ is
[40:54] a Man of Sorrows he went through that
[40:58] that he can bring you peace and
[41:00] joy praise the name of the Lord then the
[41:03] scripture says he is acquainted with
[41:09] grief you know grief things that are
[41:17] gri things that are
[41:21] painful things that are not
[41:24] pleasant but the Bible says he is
[41:30] acquainted why for you and for me took
[41:34] your place praise the name of the Lord
[41:38] whatever place you are in whatever
[41:40] position you are in whatever situation
[41:43] you are in Christ came and took over
[41:46] that
[41:47] place praise the name of the Lord then
[41:49] the Bible
[41:51] says he was
[41:54] despised and we esteemed him
[41:57] not he has surely bore our
[42:02] grief he cared
[42:05] them so whatever
[42:09] grief and you know the word grief is
[42:13] also
[42:15] BR grief can mean your
[42:18] sickness grief can mean your
[42:21] pain brief can mean in your your destion
[42:24] or things that you find are not
[42:29] good but then the Bible says Christ
[42:32] carried our
[42:35] grief now if you believe Christ carried
[42:39] them then why don't you cast whatever
[42:42] you find is your
[42:44] weakness and then give it unto the LA
[42:48] and then stop looking at your
[42:50] weaknesses stop looking at your failure
[42:53] praise the name of the Lord it may be
[42:55] your weakness in the
[42:57] body it may be your weakness in the
[42:59] human
[43:00] spirit all the time you have evil
[43:03] thoughts or evil
[43:05] desires Christ bore our
[43:09] grief Christ B all that
[43:12] weakness so then you say Lord here I am
[43:16] I'm kind of encompassed with a lot of
[43:19] failures come and take over my failure
[43:22] come and take over my
[43:24] weakness praise the name of
[43:26] so we should stop looking at our
[43:29] weaknesses and where you have your
[43:32] weakness look to Christ praise the name
[43:35] of our Lord Brother BR
[43:37] preaches Look Away to
[43:40] Jesus praise the name of our Lord if it
[43:43] is
[43:44] Affliction Look Away to Jesus if it is
[43:47] failure Look Away to Jesus if there
[43:50] sickness Look Away to Jesus praise the
[43:54] name of our Lord When the Children of
[43:56] Israel mured against Moses and God then
[44:01] the Lord sent you know FY serpents among
[44:05] them and many of them started dying and
[44:08] then Moses cried to the Lord and then
[44:11] the Lord told Moses make a Bren
[44:15] Serpent and then lift it up and then he
[44:19] said whoever looks at the serpent will
[44:22] be healed and that is the same thing
[44:25] also for us whoever looks unto Christ
[44:29] praise the name of our Lord the Bible
[44:31] says look unto me all ends of the world
[44:34] and then you shall be saved so in every
[44:37] restation you are going through the
[44:40] weaknesses of the body the weaknesses of
[44:43] the spirit whatever kind of weakness
[44:46] whatever kind of
[44:48] infirmity Christ B all
[44:51] that praise the name of our Lord so then
[44:54] you look to Christ
[44:56] praise the name of the Lord you don't go
[44:58] back with your burdens at you don't go
[45:01] back with your weaknesses back but then
[45:03] you say Lord this is my
[45:05] weakness Lord this is my failure praise
[45:09] the name of our Lord and then you don't
[45:10] rejoice in your fail but just say Lord
[45:14] this is why I'm finding it hard I'm
[45:16] failing to move
[45:18] forward and then said Lord come and take
[45:21] over this
[45:22] St so Christ he bore all our Grace
[45:26] he bought all our weaknesses he bought
[45:29] all our
[45:30] failures praise the name of the Lord so
[45:33] just be sincere before him and tell him
[45:35] Lord this is my wi Lord this is my
[45:39] failure I have a spirit of temper I have
[45:42] a spirit of this I have a spirit of this
[45:46] praise the name of the Lord like Mary
[45:49] Magdalene praise the name of our Lord
[45:52] she had
[45:54] infirmities in Luke chapter
[45:57] and then verse
[46:00] two praise the name of our Lord luk Luke
[46:04] 8 and verse
[46:07] 2 the scripture says and and certain
[46:12] women which had been
[46:14] healed of evil spirits and infirmities
[46:18] Mary called magad out of whom went seven
[46:24] devs
[46:30] [Music]
[46:34] praise the name of the Lord very
[46:37] mag had
[46:40] infirmities and evil
[46:42] spirits and you know that evil
[46:45] spirits they bring
[46:48] infirmities praise the name of our Lord
[46:51] they bring infirmities in our
[46:53] body sicknesses then they bring
[46:56] infirmities in our human
[46:59] Spirits evil
[47:02] habits sin Wicked
[47:05] wickedness but Mary Magdalene was
[47:08] delivered of all her
[47:12] infirmities now in the message questions
[47:14] and
[47:15] answers brother Bram says and two3 of
[47:19] the earth is
[47:24] in
[47:26] and more than that which two3 of the
[47:30] Angels was kicked
[47:34] out and those demon
[47:38] spirits come into the
[47:41] people and habitate their
[47:45] body see what I mean they are
[47:49] demons they once existed and they come
[47:52] into the
[47:54] people and give them a
[48:00] nature and then you find that somebody
[48:02] so
[48:05] angry a demon of anger has given him
[48:08] that
[48:09] nature somebody saw
[48:13] despising the demon of despising has
[48:16] given him that
[48:17] nature and even his body reflects what
[48:20] that demon is
[48:23] inside so then brother Bram says
[48:26] Jesus cast them out of Mary
[48:30] Magdalene
[48:34] pride is a
[48:36] demon praise the name of the Lord just
[48:38] too
[48:40] proud so it's a demon that gives you
[48:43] that
[48:45] nature that is an
[48:48] infirmity PR a name of our Lord but
[48:51] Christ died to take away that infirmity
[48:55] praise the name of then
[49:00] boasting big
[49:02] people you see me that's a demon it's a
[49:08] nature
[49:10] uncleanness
[49:15] filthy then vity you know speak
[49:20] emulations and then
[49:24] strife says all these
[49:28] things praise the name of the Lord they
[49:32] infirmities but now the Bible has told
[49:36] us that Christ he bore our
[49:41] griefs every one of the weakness that
[49:44] you may
[49:45] have call upon the name of the
[49:49] Lord and let Christ take over that
[49:53] position praise the name of the Lord
[49:56] let Christ take over that
[49:58] position and bring you
[50:01] Deliverance in Luke Chapter
[50:04] 13 and then verse 11
[50:08] verse3 the scripture
[50:11] says and behold there was a woman which
[50:14] had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and
[50:18] was born to B together and could in no
[50:22] wise lift up herself and when Jesus saw
[50:25] her he called her to him and said unto
[50:28] her woman thou at loose from thy
[50:31] infirmity and he laid his hands on her
[50:34] and immediately she was made straight
[50:36] and glorified
[50:54] God
[51:25] now
[51:30] amen praise the name of the
[51:32] Lord so now you see here this one here
[51:35] had an infirmity that she was
[51:39] bought she couldn't lift
[51:42] herself she wouldn't walk her limbs were
[51:47] weak but now when she met
[51:50] Christ Christ losed her from her
[51:54] infirmity
[51:55] body
[51:57] infirmity Mary Magdalene had a spiritual
[52:02] infirmity all our
[52:05] infirmities Christ bore
[52:08] them all our
[52:11] infirmities he came and took them
[52:14] away so then we don't look at our
[52:17] weaknesses but then we look at Christ
[52:21] who has taken over all our
[52:23] weaknesses praise the name
[52:26] and God wants us to depend upon
[52:29] him you know where you depend upon him
[52:33] the Lord come and take over all my
[52:39] failures come and take over all my
[52:43] weaknesses and everything that we have
[52:45] need
[52:46] of Christ has fully
[52:50] PCH praise the name of our Lord he died
[52:53] for our
[52:54] Redemption and it is so simple that you
[52:58] just have to believe him and all that
[53:01] you have need of comes forth just
[53:05] believing in him in the message godding
[53:08] himself in
[53:10] Simplicity oh how can I be
[53:14] complete how can I be
[53:16] complete because the
[53:19] blood not me but the blood stands
[53:23] between me and God
[53:27] I accepted
[53:30] it and he put
[53:33] it I'm a sinner but he is
[53:38] God but the
[53:42] chemistry the blood stands between
[53:47] me the kill of
[53:50] sin so God sees
[53:53] me just as
[53:59] white you know that's as in the
[54:04] bleach my sin is
[54:08] gone I it can't even reach
[54:11] him because there is a
[54:14] sacrifice laying there where is our
[54:18] faith to believe the simple word of
[54:23] God just what God
[54:26] say take him at his
[54:29] word God hies
[54:32] himself now in
[54:34] Simplicity in a humble little
[54:39] Bunch but one of these days he will
[54:43] manifest
[54:44] himself as he has always in the days
[54:48] passed
[54:49] by then he says do you love him praise
[54:52] the name of the Lord see how simple God
[54:54] does has brought it to
[54:56] us praise the name of the Lord It's just
[55:00] believe in
[55:02] Christ praise the name of the Lord just
[55:05] have
[55:07] faith and you know when they were
[55:09] telling them to apply the blood during
[55:11] The
[55:14] Exodus he told them
[55:18] use already the blood has been
[55:22] shed but then we need the high soap
[55:26] and so was common
[55:30] we even on the wall you would find
[55:33] the everywhere you would find the so you
[55:36] get
[55:37] the and then put in the
[55:48] blood so you get the high soap and then
[55:52] you put in the blood and apply to your
[55:56] condition and then brother Bram
[56:00] says represented
[56:03] Faith common
[56:05] fath by his stripes I was here just have
[56:10] faith in that then you are delivered
[56:13] from your
[56:14] sick he Bor by griefs believe that and
[56:19] then you overcome any habit you going
[56:21] through praise the name of the Lord just
[56:24] apply
[56:26] the just apply the the
[56:30] faith when you are in
[56:33] transgressions you know he says he was
[56:36] wounded for our
[56:39] [Music]
[56:41] transgression and then the Lord takes
[56:43] over that
[56:44] Str then the Bible says he was bruised
[56:47] for our
[56:50] iniquities then you apply that and then
[56:53] the iniquity goes
[56:56] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[56:59] him if you are
[57:02] troubled there is peace
[57:04] here and then he says with his stripes
[57:07] we are
[57:08] healed praise the name of the Lord so
[57:11] then we need to accept the finished work
[57:14] at
[57:16] carv Lord come in my position come and
[57:20] take over the situation I'm going come
[57:23] and take over the condition that I'm
[57:24] going
[57:25] so then you don't look at your
[57:29] weakness praise the name of our Lord but
[57:31] many times you want lament about our
[57:33] weakness we want about our failures but
[57:37] then we need to just say Lord this is
[57:40] thetion I'm going through I have too
[57:43] much uncertainity in my
[57:45] life come and take over this because you
[57:49] know the end from the
[57:51] beginning and you honestly yield
[57:53] yourself
[57:56] to take over your
[57:57] situation praise the name of our Lord
[58:00] now in Jon chapter
[58:03] 2 and then verse
[58:07] S the Bible
[58:11] says when my soul fainted within me I
[58:14] remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[58:17] in unto thee into thy Holy
[58:23] Temple
[58:32] that observe lying vanities forsake
[58:35] their own
[58:46] Mercy they that
[58:52] observe now the Bible is telling
[58:57] us when you look at lying
[59:02] vanities your
[59:05] weaknesses your
[59:08] infirmities you are forsaking your
[59:12] owny so you
[59:15] fail by looking at your
[59:18] weaknesses but then you need to look to
[59:20] the
[59:22] Lord who has called us
[59:25] and say Lord here I
[59:27] am praise the name of the Lord so you
[59:31] despise those lying
[59:34] vanities because they they are
[59:38] temporary you know they are just there
[59:40] for a short
[59:42] time and so you don't look at that but
[59:46] then you look at the
[59:48] promise and say the promise is my
[59:52] possession praise the name of
[59:55] the Divine Promises of God the things
[59:58] that God has assured
[1:00:00] us those are the things that we possess
[1:00:04] and those are the things that should be
[1:00:05] in our
[1:00:06] mind with such a positive
[1:00:10] confession praise the name of our Lord
[1:00:13] the Bible telling us that Christ is the
[1:00:16] high priest of our
[1:00:19] confession so then what is your
[1:00:23] confession confession
[1:00:26] failure or your confession is
[1:00:29] Victory praise the name of the Lord your
[1:00:33] confession is that I am strong even when
[1:00:37] I'm full of weaknesses but I confess
[1:00:40] that I am
[1:00:41] strong praise the name of our Lord so
[1:00:44] then we need to have a True
[1:00:47] Confession and say Lord you died for me
[1:00:51] you took my place and here I am I
[1:00:54] surrender myself to
[1:00:56] you I commit myself unto you I call upon
[1:01:01] your
[1:01:02] name praise the name of a living now let
[1:01:05] us go to and read about here in
[1:01:13] Matthew Matthew
[1:01:18] 14 and then verse
[1:01:23] 24
[1:01:25] the scripture
[1:01:32] says but the Sheep was now in the midst
[1:01:35] of the sea tossed with waves for the
[1:01:38] wind was
[1:01:53] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:01:57] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:02:00] the
[1:02:09] sea the disciples saw him walking on the
[1:02:12] sea they were troubled saying it is a
[1:02:15] spirit and they cried out for
[1:02:23] fear
[1:02:28] but straight away Jesus spoke unto them
[1:02:30] saying be of good cheer it is I Be not
[1:02:41] Afraid and Peter answered him and said
[1:02:44] Lord if be though B me come onto the on
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:53] water
[1:02:59] and he said come and when Peter was come
[1:03:03] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:03:06] water to go to
[1:03:16] Jesus but when he saw the wind
[1:03:18] boisterous he was afraid and beginning
[1:03:22] to sink he cried saying glor Lord save
[1:03:38] me and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[1:03:41] his hand and called him and said unto
[1:03:45] him oh th of little faith where
[1:03:53] doubt
[1:04:02] and when they were come into the ship
[1:04:04] the wind
[1:04:10] seized this is a very interesting
[1:04:13] story they were
[1:04:15] afraid they were in
[1:04:18] troubles praise the name of our Lord to
[1:04:21] much storms and
[1:04:23] everything the way we were also in
[1:04:26] sin and then we hear the
[1:04:28] gospel and when we hear the gospel we
[1:04:32] were
[1:04:33] encouraged praise the name of our Lord
[1:04:36] and then Peter when he said Lord if it
[1:04:38] is
[1:04:39] you tell me to come walking on the
[1:04:43] water and then Jesus told come walk on
[1:04:48] the
[1:04:49] water praise the name of our Lord and we
[1:04:52] have also accepted him in our life
[1:04:55] we have invited him in our lives we have
[1:04:58] invited him at our homes but you see the
[1:05:01] devil being the
[1:05:03] devil he always brings storms in our
[1:05:06] families he always brings storms in our
[1:05:09] lives and now Peter was walking towards
[1:05:13] Christ he was obeying the word of God
[1:05:17] and then the devil brought a
[1:05:20] storm and that's what happens in our
[1:05:23] daily walk
[1:05:25] the devil can bring any storm at any
[1:05:28] time but what the devil is interested in
[1:05:32] is for you to look at the
[1:05:34] stor and take your eyes away from
[1:05:37] Jesus but Jesus was
[1:05:40] coming and Peter was going towards him
[1:05:44] and we also living in a time waiting for
[1:05:47] the second coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ coming so near he coming so soon
[1:05:54] but you see the storms the devil has
[1:05:58] raged this storm of financial need this
[1:06:01] stor of sickness this St of dis pressure
[1:06:04] here this storm of family trouble this
[1:06:07] stor at place of work this storm all
[1:06:09] over the
[1:06:11] Earth praise the name of our Lord
[1:06:13] bringing too many
[1:06:15] storms
[1:06:17] raging you know things that are you
[1:06:20] can't understand things that are beyond
[1:06:23] your
[1:06:26] praise the name of our Lord Peter would
[1:06:29] not stop the storm on his
[1:06:31] own but it was again but look at the
[1:06:36] storm because Jesus told him why did you
[1:06:40] doubt and this is what the devil is also
[1:06:42] doing to take our
[1:06:46] attention from Christ so that we can
[1:06:49] look at the
[1:06:51] Devil That's what Satan is doing
[1:06:55] you know that you take away your
[1:06:57] attention from the one who has called
[1:06:59] you and then you look at your
[1:07:02] stresses then you look at your
[1:07:04] weaknesses then you look at your
[1:07:07] failures and you lose
[1:07:09] Faith to overcome what you're going
[1:07:12] through and that's what Peter was going
[1:07:15] through he started looking at the storm
[1:07:18] and the devil always wants to Shield the
[1:07:21] presence of
[1:07:22] God
[1:07:24] the devil always wants us to think the
[1:07:26] Lord is away from
[1:07:30] us the devil always wants us to
[1:07:33] think God is Not on our side so that he
[1:07:37] takes you alone by the side and it can
[1:07:40] afflict
[1:07:42] you but don't allow to look at the
[1:07:45] storms of life don't allow look at your
[1:07:49] weaknesses don't allow to look at your
[1:07:52] failures look unto the Lord you have
[1:07:55] believed I said Lord here I am even when
[1:07:59] Peter failed he didn't just continue
[1:08:02] drowning but he called on the name of
[1:08:04] the Lord Lord Save Me Lord deliver me

[1:12:39] he took through Peter when he was

[1:12:48] God praise the name of the Lord is a
[1:12:51] very present help in
[1:12:57] trouble praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:59] Psalms 46 and verse
[1:13:03] one God is our refuge and strength a
[1:13:07] very present help in trouble therefore
[1:13:11] we will not fear though the Earth be
[1:13:14] removed and though the mountains be
[1:13:16] carried into the midst of the sea that
[1:13:19] the waters thereof roow and be troubled
[1:13:22] that the mountains shake with the

[1:13:28] 46:1 up to verse
[1:13:52] three 46 verse
[1:14:22] one
[1:14:51] praise the name of the Lord he says God

[1:15:07] trouble he says is a very
[1:15:11] present praise the name you just need to
[1:15:14] believe that with all your

[1:15:24] Lord come down in this that
[1:15:26] I'm Lord come and deliver
[1:15:30] me I'm encompassed with a lot of
[1:15:34] weaknesses but yet I'm depending upon
[1:15:37] you like Jonah he was encompassed with
[1:15:40] you know vomit and weeds in the Bell the
[1:15:44] belly of the
[1:15:46] fish but he didn't look at his
[1:15:49] station he regarded his station as a
[1:15:52] lying
[1:15:55] and we should do the same thing regard
[1:15:58] your
[1:16:01] weaknesses you take your
[1:16:03] weaknesses as a lying
[1:16:06] vanity because there is a promise that
[1:16:09] the Lord has given unto us praise the
[1:16:12] name of the Lord that he has given us
[1:16:15] Victory and so you take that Victory you
[1:16:19] claim that Victory praise the name of
[1:16:21] our Lord and say Lord
[1:16:24] this is what I possess I'm not
[1:16:26] possessing the failures I have I'm not

[1:16:32] not owning the weaknesses that I have
[1:16:35] but I'm taking the promise of God praise
[1:16:38] the name of the Lord because he who has
[1:16:41] promised is faithful praise the name of
[1:16:45] our Lord and then the Bible says greater
[1:16:48] is he that is in
[1:16:52] US devil that's in the world greater is
[1:16:55] he that has promised us than the devil
[1:16:58] that's getting us into
[1:17:00] weaknesses praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:03] and then you possess that g
[1:17:05] of you take over that kind of
[1:17:09] weakness and then you come out when you
