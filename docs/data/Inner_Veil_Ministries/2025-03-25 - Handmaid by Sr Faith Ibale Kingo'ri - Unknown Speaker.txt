TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The road you've chosen for me has not been an easy one. I'm humbled by your grace and the fact that you chose me. I've been ostracized for being yours. have been misunderstood and judged by men, yet still I yield to your will. I am the handmade of the Lord. I have nothing much to give. I submit to your command. [Music] Holy unto me as you say. Oh, I am the handmade. The handmade of the Lord. I have nothing much to give. eyes of me to your [Music] home. Be it through me as you say like Ruth I'm hungry and gleaning in the field. I lay at your feet, Lord, and pray you will cover me. I've been headless and without a name. I've been praying for my king's man to redeem me and call me his bad. [Music] I am the handmade of the Lord. I have nothing much to give. I submit to your command. [Music] Holy unto me as you say. Like Moses in the wilderness, you've seated me and you've commissioned me as a bride of Jesus. You ask me what is it I'm holding? It's simply a bit upon crooked line. But you say I see I will use it. I am the hand of the Lord. I have nothing much to give. I submit to your command. [Music] Oh, unto me as you say. [Music] I walk by faith, not sight. I know you have great plans. Like Esther, I will say for such a time as this. Oh, I'm watching to see the fourth man in the fire waiting like Lazarus to hear. You call me. Speak low. Thy servant is listening. Oh, I am the hand of the Lord. I have nothing much to do to your command. Glor to me as you [Music] said I as your [Music] single. [Music] Oh, I am the hand. I am the high of the Lord. I have nothing much to give. I submit to you to me as you say. I am ready for your will. Lord to me as you say. I surrender to your will, Lord. To me as you. I give you my heart, Lord. I give you my life. As you said, my savior. as you say. I surrender to your will, Lord. Unto me. [Music] Amen.
