testimony that our brother uhas has got a means of Transport God has blessed him amen and he has got a vehicle praise the name of the Lord it is a Noah model 2010 it is ubq 055 D is out there and it is a great honor he says it is a great honor to appreciate your prayers and the support you have given him and he returns the glory to God so let us dedicate that as you lift your hands amen so that God May cover that vehicle with his blood glorious Heavenly Father we want to thank you Lord for our brother Lord who has got this vehicle father it is to help him in serving you I pray that Lord you

it to Spirits we want to break them away from it in the name of Jesus Christ may you fill it with your spirit cover it with your PL be a blessing in Jesus Christ I pray amen amen we thank God Amen so that is achievement number one for brother Silas that's why he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then the rest all things all shall be to you when he says all I don't know the sky is the limit amen even the plane even the airplane amen amen but the best thing apart from salvation is a wife to a man so I believe it is also on the way Hallelujah it is among all things glorious glorious father may you be praised Hallelujah let us uh get into the reading of the word I don't want to keep you standing praise the name of the Lord we shall we shall only read John 156 then the other scripture which is long read it while you are seated it will be Genesis 12 verse 1 to8 now let's read this one in opening as you see you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you may the Lord add a blessing upon his word you may be seated in Jesus name praise the name of the Lord amen now to introduce my top none chooses God but he CH us none chooses God but he chose us no one of us has ever chosen him but he chose us praise the name of the Lord so that's why I sang that song Amen a fixed Choice a fixed a fixed choice of God hallelujah hallelujah so that is the inspiration praise the name of the Lord a fixed choice of God when I was thinking about this scripture when I read it and I thought about it then I started thinking about it and then I looked into my Bible this song came into my mind hallelujah hallelujah what a happy moment when you get to recognize that you are the chosen of God if you identify yourself and you get to know your position that you are a daughter and a son of God you are a fixed Choice there is no demon there is no spirit that can anal that praise the name of the Lord nothing can separate us from the love of God what shall separate us is it death Hallelujah let me talk the the worst it is death the name of the Lord neither death can separate us from the love of Christ praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let us go to Genesis 12 verse 1 amen amen hallelujah hallelujah now the Lord now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and to the land that I will show thee praise the name of the Lord God is now deciding to go and call a man who is not even aware who is in his own businesses and God ches just God by his own choice amen he loves a man who was woring Idols brother Bram says and he looks after that one and he says you are my choice come now hallelujah hallelujah get out of those things come out hallelujah hallelujah verse two and I will make of thee a great nation and I'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing Hallelujah God just decides to say I will I will please I will hallelujah hallelujah which Abraham had not requested Abraham had not applied for it but God decided God decided it and God was confident hallelujah hallelujah that when Abraham comes and be with him God said I will make you great hallelujah hallelujah even your name will be great I don't care what others call you others be little you but I will make you great and your name will be great praise the name of the Lord my brother my sister dear friend who is listening to me God does not care what others look at you what others think of you or what others uh we you with or whether you educated whether you are not educated whether you are not from a royal Clan whether you are from a royal Clan God does not look at that God looks at his own choice praise the name of the Lord verse uh verse four so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abraham was 7 and and five years old when he departed out of Heron verse five and Abraham took Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son their substances they had GA and all their substances that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Heron and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan into the land of Canaan they came hallelujah hallelujah they had to he the voice of God and when they hi the voice of God amen amen they had to go to where God wanted them to be when you hear the voice of God then you have to come out and get where God wants you to be hallelujah hallelujah I don't care what you are doing I don't care what uh What uh title they had given you Amen in this world I don't care what off you have but if God has called you you must come out of all those things come to where God wants you to be you are the choice he has made you are the fixed choice that God has made and he wants you to be with him praise the name of the Lord amen let me remove this second one the other one is working amen amen praise the name of the Lord amen so God Wants You There When Abraham heard and he hid the voice of God and the desire of God the will of God concerning him he had to follow the will of God and that's why we pray thy will be done hallelujah hallelujah here on Earth as it is being done in let the will of God be done the will of God concerning you because God has good plans for and you don't know the plans he has for you unless you come to where he wants you to and he will start unfolding and revealing his plans for you he will start un unveiling them for you he will start showing you through his word and he will open your understanding you will no longer lean to your understanding you will lean to his own understanding and you will trust in him in all things and then all will be well with you praise the name of the Lord are we together amen oh I'm leaving you so hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and then verse six and Abraham and Abraham passed through the land and to the place of shikim and to the plain of moray and the Canaanites was then in the land let me tell you when you get saved don't expect to come and find everything easy easy you are going to find the canites hallelujah hallelujah and who are the canites trials Temptations amen praise the name of the Lord had conditions for you a Christian for you born again yes you'll find them there but that's the place God wants you to be God wants you to go through those trials God wants to find you in those trials and he are staying there you are not leaning on your own understanding in the first place you are not the one who brought yourself there so God will get you into the trials and put you there did you know that God the spirit of God L Jesus Christ in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil does the scripture say so was it the spirit of the Lord which led Jesus Christ to be tempted of Satan is that scripture or it is my words is it scripture it is scripture so God will lead you why is God leading his lovely child into Satan's hands because it is the will of God concerning you as a child of God and God has confidence in you he knows you can never be defeated hallelujah hallelujah he gives you the grace to go through and after you have gone through God will rejoice and the angels will rejoice and it says behold my daughter behold my son Hallelujah Hallelujah like it was for job hallelujah hallelujah God rejoices when he sees you overcoming trials I'm shocking you right praise the name of the Lord there were canites there and verse S says and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded and there builded he an altar unto the Lord and appeared unto him had appeared unto him rather yes hallelujah hallelujah after you gone through trials after you have overcome that's when God will come and shows himself to you that I'm here I have all through been here hallelujah hallelujah I am here with you we've been going through with you because I can never leave you nor forsake you that's what he saying I will never leave you nor forsake you until the end of all these Generations praise the name of the Lord he is with us because he chose us never to lose us he saved you never to lose you brother Bram says does not save you today when he knows he's going to lose you tomorrow then that would not is not God if he know he's saving you today and he doesn't know he's going to lose you tomorrow but God who is all sufficient omnicient he knows all things he knows what tomorrow may bring praise the name of the Lord and when he saves you today he knows he will never lose you praise the name of the Lord and that's why the Lord Jesus Christ said all those you have given me in my right hand who have believed your name I have lost none now father let that Glory we had with you in the beginning hallelujah hallelujah come upon them praise the name of the Lord he wants the glory his glory God's glory to be manifested in you praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah do you love him you see where I'm coming from now let's go to verse eight and he removed from then unto a mountain on the east of bethl and pitched his tent having bethl on the way West and high on the East and there he builded an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of our Lord [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you know the canites in the land they were Thorns they were Thorns hallelujah hallelujah they were wasps praise the name of the Lord amen amen but Abraham had to find an altar when God appeared to him and showed his present with him God showed his presence with him because it was God who looked for Abraham Abraham did not look for God and then God called him said come and I show you the where I will take you and bless you in the land Abraham followed believed God Hallelujah did not doubt God hallelujah hallelujah he followed God rather if you believed you confessed him to be your never doubt never have a speck of doubt that is going to lose you you are not going to be lost he will show you the way he will guide you he will give you the victory he give you the blessings he will give you his glory and you will be you will have a Radiance around you the glory of God around you praise the name of the Lord everywhere you go everywhere you show your face you are the fixed choice of God must manifest himself through you people will see God hallelujah hallelujah the company you are going to they will see God School you are going to teach in they will see God hallelujah hallelujah the radiance of God the glory of God shining around you praise the name of the Lord why you are the fixed choice of God you did not choose him in the first place he chose you for what purpose to manifest himself so let his will be done in diseases God chooses you to manifest himself as a Healer the great physician how will he be known how will he be known without a sick pastor and who is supposed to be a sick p is it the nonbeliever it must be your believer so that by his stripes you may know that I am healed call upon the name of the Lord what you call upon the name of the Lord Abraham called upon the name and you know what all the Canaanites had to Bow Abraham did not fight the battle God F the praise the name of the Lord amen amen do you love him Romans 10:2 and 21 but Isaias is very bold and says I was found of them that sought me not I Was Made manifest unto them that asked me not after me M hallelujah hallelujah Abraham did not have a Bible like we have Bibles Abraham did not have a message book or a message tape like we have them but Abraham hallelujah hallelujah so God man in himself you see if we talk about uh an unconditioned Covenant that was between the abic it was unconditional because God himself comes I will I will hallelujah hallelujah so here in Paul tells the Romans Isaiah is very Bold And he says he's saying that says the Lord the voice of God saying I was found of them that sought me notes so you are the one I am the one I did not seek God me if he Sal me I be confident in him and I'll be persuaded that is more than able to take me through I don't care what circumstances he will carry you through He Will Carry Me Through because he chose me not to lose me not to make me a failure persuaded are you amen praise the name of the Lord and if you are convinced and you are concerned then you are persuaded stay in your position if you a Believer be a believer it and show it hallelujah hallelujah don't be there I don't know whether I'm a Believer or whether I'm not be confident in who you are verse 21 hallelujah hallelujah but to Israel he saith all the day long I have stretched forth my hands and to a disobedient and gaining people if you refuse your calling and your election it is not God's failure it is your own failure so you you own failure hallelujah hallelujah but God fa not and like we always sing that song [Music] hallelujah hallelujah let me not sing because when I sing I may go into singing amen let's read here praise the name of the Lord Brother Bram says in this message Jehovah I now Abraham let's take just a little look at his life who was he where did he come from was this a special born child sir have you heard that was Abraham a special born child neither was I a special born child nether were are you a special born child hallelujah hallelujah there is nothing special that was upon me to be chosen of God there is nothing special that was upon you to be chosen of God it was his own choice because of his love and when his love projected Grace took over and Grace will always [Music] abide are we together praise the name of the Lord I feel like preaching it but I'm not a preacher I am just testifying and re-echoing it to you that's what you are supposed to be you know the attribute of God is what is looking for that attribute of God is in you and that's why he follows you shall get to see it here praise the name of the Lord he was just an ordinary man he come from his father down from Babylon and perhaps was raised around idolatry but go but but God by election chose Abraham not because that he was a good man but because God elected Abraham and that's the only way that you will ever come to God knowing that God's love is elective and he has elected me to make me his choice he knows what he wants to do with me I don't know what to do but he knows I am not what I wanted to be hallelujah hallelujah amen but I know I am not what I used to be amen at least what I am now has made me that he has brought me this far able to carry me hallelujah hallelujah praise God I like that Abraham was an idol he was like some of us where we come from some of us come from Clans whereby they are witches amen amen born in witchcraft to of Witchcraft they start cut cutting your flesh that they are protecting you huh they are dedicating you to Demons but what are you now you are not that which they made you to be because they are not the ones who gave you the life the one who gave you the life has an attribute in you that he's looking for and he's still seeking for that's why has brought you here so stay here and see what he wants to make you hallelujah hallelujah stay here a amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so uh he says God does the choosing you have nothing to do with it there is no man has s God any time you can't seek God it's God seeking you it's something in you hallelujah hallelujah creating that desire oh my my my my praise the name of the Lord amen something in you creating that desire and Paul says is the love of God that constrain us second Corinthians chapter 5 I think praise the name of the Lord that's where it is found but I'm not reading there I'm continuing with my quote hallelujah hallelujah I'm trying to confirm that statement from the messenger it's something in you creating that desire what something is that the love of God that that Thrills Thrills my soul it is love and that love of Christ constrains you not notice Abraham he was just an ordinary man come down from the Tower of Babel with his father and they settled down probably was up in the land of sh come on down into the city of in the land of the and he was just an ordinary man not nothing not nothing not no saint no God just an ordinary man yes just as an an ordinary man nothing about him any different than anyone else no more than there is you just an ordinary person but God saw something in him saw something in him and he called him God seen the same thing in every born again man and woman hallelujah hallelujah are you one of them this statement I'm in it so I'm Abraham's seed amen not even an ordinary seed but a royal seed Abraham Hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen you see what brother Bram says is comparing you and I when we were called by God and God decided to make us his fix choice to bring us out of unbelief of heathenism idolatry hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord now he says there is nothing that was special Abraham read about Abraham as the father of Faith hallelujah hallelujah as the blessed man of God and Abraham himself God even stated it that I will make you a blessing amen you a human being I will make you a blessing and brother sister if you are in the position where you have remained where God brought you and you have found your position know that yourself you are the blessing don't start looking for blessing which church has a blessing blessing you are the

must be a possessor don't be a loser let me see the hands of possessors Hallelujah Hallelujah then be bold and be confident you must be persuaded hallelujah hallelujah amen so he says here hallelujah hallelujah now Abraham wasn't afraid to put his his his to work are you hallelujah hallelujah his face he was not afraid to put it to work are you are you putting to to work your faith are you putting it to work then if you putting it to work hallelujah hallelujah you are one of them hallelujah hallelujah you are one of the possessors of their enemy Gates the same face that he gave Abraham he gives it to you freely if you will use it it does not give you faith that you are not going to use and he gives to that one who is found in his or her place are we together because he chose you to bring you out and take you in and when he takes you in he wants to find you there when you get out of that land of blessing where he said he will bless you you will never be blessed cures will follow you amen loses you will hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and that's why in 2 Corinthians 5 ver 13 17 let us read it now praise the name of the Lord amen am for whether we be beside ourselves

amen I love that amen oh what a what a promise what a promise what a promise the name of the Lord amen he says here I quote but on this election God chose Abraham not because he was an educated man not because he was a smart man but because that God saw something in AB before the Fountain of the world I me before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and that's the reason you are a Christian is because that God saw something in you before the foundation of the of the Christ of the world rather put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world ever was formed hallelujah hallelujah do you hear that that's what God saw in you and that's the reason you are here to hear this why are you hearing it because it was an attribute of God that was put in you the foundations of the world at
