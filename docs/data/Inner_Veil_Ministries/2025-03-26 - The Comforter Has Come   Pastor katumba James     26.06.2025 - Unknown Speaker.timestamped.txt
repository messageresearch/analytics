[19:36] Christ we thank you Lord for this
[19:39] evening the privilege that you've given
[19:41] un us
[19:43] father that Lord we can come in your
[19:47] presence Lord you said in your
[19:50] word that where two or three are gaed in
[19:53] your
[19:54] name you will be there in their midst
[19:58] and Lord we believe you here in our
[20:01] midst therefore we commit ourselves unto
[20:04] your
[20:05] hands and father you said also in your
[20:09] word they shall be taught of the
[20:12] Lord and great shall be their
[20:15] peace we pray Lord you may teach us
[20:18] through your
[20:19] word and grant us that peace that
[20:22] surpasses all
[20:25] understanding and bless us all together
[20:27] tonight
[20:29] may you meet all the needs of your
[20:30] children
[20:32] Lord touch our bodies
[20:35] Lord and touch also our
[20:38] souls and make us
[20:41] whole in the name of Jesus Christ
[20:44] us
[20:46] amen we go to John chapter
[20:54] 14 I greet in the name of our Lord Jesus
[20:56] Christ
[20:59] we go to John Chapter
[21:02] 14 verse 16 to verse
[21:12] 18 and I will pray the father and he
[21:14] shall give you another comforter that he
[21:18] may abide with you forever
[21:30] even the
[21:32] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[21:37] receive because it sees him not neither
[21:42] knoweth him but you know him for he
[21:46] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[22:06] I will not leave you comfortless I'll
[22:08] come to
[22:14] you of his word may be
[22:18] seated so this evening I want talk on
[22:21] the
[22:23] subject the comforter has come
[22:28] praise the name of the Lord the
[22:31] comforter has
[22:33] come and so here we see the scripture
[22:36] telling
[22:38] us that the
[22:41] comforter is the spirit of
[22:45] Truth praise the name of the Lord and we
[22:48] can also
[22:49] say because when you read in John
[22:52] chapter
[22:55] 17 and then verse 17
[22:59] he says sanctify them through Thy word
[23:02] thy truth
[23:05] rather Thy word is
[23:08] truth so we can also that the spirit of
[23:14] Truth is the spirit of the
[23:17] word praise the name of the Lord so he
[23:21] says even the spirit of the
[23:26] world even the spirit of the the
[23:30] world which the world cannot
[23:35] receive why couldn't the world receive
[23:38] the
[23:40] spirit because they have rejected the
[23:44] word and where the word of God is
[23:48] rejected the spirit of God cannot have a
[23:51] free cause in
[23:54] that praise the name of our
[23:56] Lord so in the when you look at that
[23:59] word
[24:02] comforter comforter means
[24:11] Advocate comforter means
[24:18] Advocate you know the one who is called
[24:21] to your
[24:25] side like when you go to the courts of
[24:27] law
[24:30] when you have maybe a case there to
[24:33] answer so The
[24:36] Advocate is the one who stands for
[24:39] you is the one who talks to the judge on
[24:42] your
[24:45] behalf so even the holy spirit is our
[24:50] Advocate it talks on our he stands on
[24:54] our
[24:55] side he comes to our Aid
[25:00] you know so he pleads our case before
[25:03] the
[25:06] judge he intercedes for
[25:10] us praise the name of our Lord he helps
[25:14] us you know he enables
[25:17] us he assists us a Christian
[25:21] Life is full of
[25:25] challenges is full of you know kind of
[25:27] like TR of the
[25:30] devil there's a lot of opposition from
[25:35] Satan need the holy
[25:38] spirit that the Holy Ghost can always
[25:40] help you in all those
[25:45] challenges to warn you what is going to
[25:49] happen the way the scripture tells
[25:53] us in John 14 and verse 26
[25:58] the Bible says but the
[26:02] comforter which is the Holy
[26:05] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[26:13] name he shall teach you all
[26:19] things he shall bring all things to your
[26:25] remembrance and whatsoever I have said
[26:28] unto
[26:29] you so now you see that when we receive
[26:32] the baptism of the Holy
[26:35] Spirit we receive a
[26:39] teacher an inside
[26:41] teacher in other words he gives us
[26:45] guidance he tells us what to
[26:49] do he directs
[26:51] us when the scripture says as many as
[26:55] are led by the spirit of God
[27:00] they are the children of
[27:02] God so now when you accept the Lord
[27:05] Jesus Christ as your personal
[27:09] savior allow him to fill you with the
[27:11] Holy
[27:13] Spirit praise the name of the Lord and
[27:15] it's not difficult to be filled with the
[27:19] Holy
[27:20] Spirit just as we've been going through
[27:23] this Wednesday services
[27:28] of the Holy
[27:30] Spirit the way Jesus says in John 3 and
[27:37] verse that unless a man is born
[27:42] again he cannot understand the kingdom
[27:45] of
[27:46] God and then brother Bram says to
[27:51] understand to
[27:53] see and now if you are
[27:56] blind to the things of
[27:59] God how will you appreciate the things
[28:02] of
[28:04] God just the way the scripture says in
[28:06] First
[28:13] Corinthians from verse 9 to verse
[28:17] 13 it says no man knows the things of
[28:23] God except the spirit of
[28:26] God so even us to not things of
[28:29] God we must receive the spirit of
[28:33] God and this is what he's saying that
[28:35] the Holy
[28:38] Spirit when he comes he will teach us
[28:42] all
[28:43] things not some things and see brother
[28:47] was challenging the p in his
[28:52] day he says you say I've spoken in
[28:55] Tong you know I've done this
[28:58] I've prophesied then he says but then
[29:01] how can you say that you have the spirit
[29:03] of
[29:06] God and then you follow the Trinity
[29:10] baptism when it is revealed that the
[29:13] name of Jesus
[29:16] Christ because the holy spirit will
[29:20] always guide us to the word of
[29:24] God praise the name of our Lord will
[29:26] always direct us there
[29:30] now in the message the Ephesian Church
[29:33] age he says the way of God is
[29:40] Holiness let this be known to every
[29:42] member
[29:45] here of the body of
[29:49] Christ until you live a holy
[29:54] life God refuses your sacrifice
[30:00] and you see if we can take some bit of
[30:02] time on this
[30:05] area people want to
[30:09] sacrifice but they don't want to
[30:12] obey they think that they can do all the
[30:15] sacrifices they can
[30:22] do I can
[30:24] pray I can fast I can do great things
[30:29] which is all good but the first thing to
[30:33] do is be obedient to the word of
[30:37] God that's when the Lord will accept
[30:39] your
[30:42] sacrifices praise the name of our Lord
[30:45] you know they they don't want to obey
[30:47] the word of
[30:49] God but then they want to do the
[30:52] sacrifices and then they think that God
[30:55] will accept them
[30:58] because they are giving a
[31:00] sacrifice but at the same time despising
[31:03] the word of
[31:05] God the same thing like
[31:08] Saul Saul was told you go and kill all
[31:11] the
[31:13] people and so when he reached in that
[31:17] place he reserved the best sheep and the
[31:20] best
[31:23] things and then he said we've brought
[31:25] them to sacrifice to God
[31:29] and then the prophet was asking
[31:32] Saul does God appreciate your sacrifices
[31:36] more than obedience to his
[31:42] word you can pick that from first
[31:47] Samuel first
[31:49] Samuel and then we go
[31:53] to verse chapter 16 chapter 15 rather
[31:59] and then
[32:02] verse verse
[32:06] 21 okay let us start from
[32:11] verse verse
[32:13] 20 and Saul said unto Samuel yes I have
[32:18] obeyed the voice of the Lord and have
[32:20] gone the way which the Lord sent me and
[32:23] have brought aak the king of AMC and
[32:25] have utterly destroyed the amalekites
[32:27] but the people took of the spoil the
[32:30] sheep and The Oxen the chip of the
[32:32] things which should have been D utter
[32:34] destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[32:37] God in G
[33:05] [Music]
[33:13] and Samuel said has the Lord as great
[33:16] Delight in burnt offerings and
[33:19] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[33:22] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[33:25] sacrifice and to hearken than the f
[33:49] praise the name of the Lord obedience to
[33:51] the word of
[33:53] God and that's what always brings the
[33:55] comforter
[33:58] because the
[33:59] comforter is the teacher of the
[34:02] word the comforter is the
[34:06] instructor praise the name of our Lord
[34:09] the comforter is the
[34:12] preacher now if you are rejecting to
[34:15] hear the
[34:17] preacher then how can he come inside of
[34:21] you how can he come and make his AB in
[34:25] you
[34:28] when you have rejected his
[34:30] voice praise the name of our Lord it
[34:33] can't work out so the way the Holy Ghost
[34:36] can come in our
[34:39] lives is if we can hear the word of
[34:43] God and then be obedient to that word of
[34:47] God and that's how the Holy Ghost
[34:50] comes and let me say this
[34:52] also by the time you accept the Lord
[34:55] Jesus Christ as your savior
[35:00] that means you have surrendered to be
[35:02] obedient to what the Lord will tell you
[35:04] to
[35:09] do praise the name of Lord the says
[35:13] believeth with the
[35:15] heart and then confession is made with
[35:18] the
[35:20] mouth so you
[35:22] confess what you have
[35:25] believed and what you believe
[35:28] you confess it and then you do
[35:31] it and then you obey it that's how the
[35:35] Holy Ghost comes down in our
[35:38] hearts so the brother Bram is
[35:41] saying that if you don't live a holy
[35:46] life then God refuses your
[35:52] sacrifice all our sacrifices are in
[35:56] vain we not obedient to the word of
[36:00] God praise the name of our Lord and you
[36:03] know there are many aspects you can talk
[36:05] about
[36:09] obedience praise the name of our Lord
[36:13] you know like God has given you a
[36:14] certain
[36:18] responsibility like sa was given a
[36:21] responsibility Go and Kill
[36:26] everything he went and did it
[36:28] halfway and then the good things
[36:30] reserved for
[36:32] himself then God said you have rejected
[36:34] my
[36:36] voice so then when we hear the word of
[36:40] God you need to be obedient to the word
[36:43] of
[36:45] God let me just talk about the common
[36:47] things that we
[36:49] do like the word of God tells
[36:52] us love your
[36:55] enemy very it's so it's EAS to find
[36:59] out who your enemy
[37:02] is and it is EAS to hate
[37:06] them but then for you when you find your
[37:11] enemy do you justify hating
[37:20] them you know like Naturally
[37:24] Speaking you dislike those who dislike
[37:27] you
[37:29] and you like those who like you
[37:31] that's but then we are talking about AAL
[37:35] life of Jesus
[37:38] Christ not the
[37:40] natural the natural you give the one who
[37:43] gives
[37:45] you but then
[37:47] the you give the one who can't even give
[37:51] you you go beyond what the natural
[37:55] is so then we can check our
[37:58] Liv and then find out are we obedient to
[38:02] the word of
[38:04] God somebody cheats
[38:07] you do you pray for them or do you
[38:11] forgive
[38:12] them because these are the basics every
[38:14] day we go through these kind of
[38:18] things your
[38:20] neighbors maybe your
[38:22] family maybe at home you have a
[38:26] misunderstanding at home
[38:29] maybe among the
[38:30] children or among the husband and the
[38:34] wife among children and the
[38:37] parents what do you think about your
[38:41] parents what do you think about your
[38:44] children you start curing them because
[38:48] they have done something wrong to
[38:50] you but yet the word of God
[38:53] says praise the name of our Lord pray
[38:56] for those that despitefully use
[38:59] you let us go to MTH
[39:03] 5 praise the name of our
[39:06] Lord Matthew
[39:08] 5 and then we go to verse
[39:14] 40 verse
[39:17] 44 okay let us start from verse
[39:21] 43 you've heard that it has been said
[39:24] thou sht love thy neighbor and Hate th
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] enemy but I say unto you love your
[39:46] enemies bless them that curse you do
[39:50] good to them that hate you and pray for
[39:52] them which despitefully use you and
[39:55] persecute you
[40:12] praise the name of
[40:14] Lord love your
[40:16] enemies bless them that Cur
[40:19] you do good to them that hate
[40:24] you pray for those that despitefully use
[40:27] you and persecute
[40:32] you praise the name of our Lord you see
[40:35] God requires obedience to these
[40:40] things you've heard don't hate your
[40:43] enemy so you love them now you say Lord
[40:47] help me to Love My
[40:50] Enemy maybe your boss at place of
[40:54] work he doesn't want to pay your salary
[40:59] now you don't wish to hear bad things
[41:01] about
[41:03] him I wish his family would get into the
[41:05] same situation I get into the same kind
[41:08] of
[41:09] thing so then you pray Lord give me the
[41:14] Grace To Love My
[41:17] Enemy Lord give me the grace to pray for
[41:20] these people you know there are people
[41:23] in your life even don't want to hear
[41:25] about
[41:28] you don't want to hear that name or if
[41:30] you hear that they coming you make
[41:32] excuse of not going where they going to
[41:39] be keep them in prayers brother says
[41:43] that sweeten your temple bitterness with
[41:48] prayer and then you pray Lord deliver me
[41:50] from that condition Lord deliver me from
[41:53] that evil heart
[41:55] against deliver me from these evil
[41:58] thoughts about this
[41:59] person
[42:02] that and then verse5 he
[42:05] says that you may be the children of
[42:08] your father which is in
[42:13] heaven praise the name of the Lord so
[42:16] the children of
[42:18] God they love their
[42:20] enemies praise the name of our Lord the
[42:23] children of God don't wish evil for
[42:31] anybody you know so you have that kind
[42:33] of
[42:35] love and you know that kind of
[42:38] sweetness you know even for your
[42:41] enemies like brother Billy Paul was
[42:44] talking about brother
[42:47] Bram he said you can't tell who who his
[42:50] enemy is or who his friend is
[42:58] then brother Bram
[43:00] says you disagree with
[43:05] anybody
[43:07] now so where is the
[43:10] comforter because when the comforter is
[43:13] inside of
[43:14] you he will convict
[43:18] you that what you have done is
[43:21] wrong praise the name of the Lord and
[43:23] then you say Lord have mercy upon me
[43:27] deliver me from this kind of
[43:30] situation praise the name of the Lord so
[43:33] then brother Bram
[43:34] says before we can go further to that
[43:37] let us go to John chapter
[43:41] 16 and then we can read verse
[43:44] 7 it says nevertheless I tell you that I
[43:49] tell you the truth it's expedient for
[43:51] you that I go away for if I go not away
[43:56] the comforter will not come unto you but
[43:59] if I depart I will send him unto
[44:16] you and when he is come he will reprove
[44:20] the world of sin and of righteousness
[44:22] and of judgment
[44:32] of sin because they believe not on
[44:38] me of righteousness because I go to my
[44:42] father and you see me
[44:48] no of judgment because the prince of
[44:52] this world is judged
[44:57] now he says when the comforter is
[45:03] come he will prove the world of
[45:07] sin so now when you have the Holy
[45:12] Spirit the holy spirit will always guide
[45:17] you because the Bible says in verse
[45:21] 13 how but when he the spirit of Truth
[45:24] is come
[45:27] he will guide you into all
[45:32] truth and truth is the word of
[45:36] God so now if the truth which is the
[45:38] word of
[45:41] God is telling us to love our
[45:46] enemies and you have the Holy
[45:49] Spirit and you can afford to hit your
[45:54] enemy if the spirit of God is in
[45:59] you and for
[46:01] you you can easily hate your
[46:07] enemy and you have no
[46:11] conviction there's no Holy Spirit
[46:13] there praise the name of the Lord that's
[46:16] what it implies but if the holy spirit
[46:19] is
[46:20] there he will reprove
[46:25] thatting he will proove it in your
[46:29] life he will proove that things in your
[46:33] life and then you can say Lord have
[46:36] mercy upon me in this kind of
[46:40] area praise the name of the Lord and
[46:43] then you call on the name of the
[46:45] Lord then he comes and helps
[46:49] you praise the name of Lord that's how
[46:52] the Holy Spirit
[46:54] works the Holy Ghost is not not an
[46:59] imagination oh just a thought I think I
[47:02] have the Holy
[47:03] Spirit but the holy spirit is a
[47:08] reality praise the name of the Lord and
[47:11] you know we are living in a
[47:13] time where people want to get the
[47:16] comfort of emotions and
[47:22] Sensations people want the satisfaction
[47:27] of the holy spirit with emotions and
[47:34] Sensations say you see I have the Holy
[47:36] Ghost
[47:37] here but that's not what it is it is the
[47:42] Life of Christ
[47:44] himself praise the name of the Lord but
[47:46] you know people want to show that I have
[47:48] the Holy
[47:50] Ghost because I
[47:52] shouted surely you can Shout with the
[47:55] Holy Ghost
[47:57] I can speak with thanks with the Holy
[47:59] Ghost I can feel emotion with the Holy
[48:02] Ghost but yet at the same time I may not
[48:06] do what you know one may think I have to
[48:08] do
[48:13] this because the Holy Ghost is
[48:16] Sovereign praise the name of the Lord
[48:19] but the people seek the Holy
[48:22] Spirit following emotions
[48:27] how did you
[48:28] [Music]
[48:31] feel
[48:36] maybe but when you test their
[48:40] love
[48:42] hatred why is that Holy Spirit
[48:46] now you know you find that is something
[48:48] which is not
[48:50] true you know brother Bram
[48:53] said that one of the SS sure that
[48:57] somebody is Born
[49:01] Again is
[49:03] humility
[49:05] humility and the humility of
[49:08] God will always bring the love of
[49:13] God will bring the you know the
[49:15] sweetness of
[49:17] God but if I'm the person all the time
[49:20] criticizing the other
[49:22] oneing the other one that one doesn't
[49:25] have the Holy Ghost that one doesn't
[49:27] have the Holy Ghost I need to check
[49:30] myself
[49:31] first where is the sweetness of
[49:34] God praise the name of our Lord so he
[49:37] says the spirit of
[49:40] truth will guide us into all
[49:44] truth that's
[49:46] what Obedience of all the
[49:50] word and then the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:54] says praise the name of our Lord
[49:57] in John chapter
[50:02] 15 and then
[50:04] verse
[50:07] 12 this is my commandment that you love
[50:10] one another as I have
[50:18] loved praise the
[50:20] name this is my
[50:25] commandment that you love
[50:27] another John
[50:30] 13 and verse
[50:32] 35 okay let us start from verse
[50:37] 34 a new commandment I give unto
[50:43] you that you love one
[50:47] another as I have loved
[50:50] you that ye also love one
[50:55] another by this shall all men
[51:01] know that you are my
[51:04] disciples if you love one
[51:07] another and you know when you read these
[51:09] scriptures are very
[51:12] interesting in John Chapter
[51:16] 13 he puts an emphas on
[51:20] love in John chter
[51:22] 14 puts an emphasis on love
[51:26] in John chapter
[51:28] 15 he puts an emphas on
[51:30] love in John chapter
[51:33] 16 puts an emphas on
[51:36] love in John chapter
[51:38] 17 he puts an emphas on
[51:41] love and all this these scriptures
[51:45] here from John Chapter
[51:48] 13 up to John chapter
[51:53] 17 they all happened in a short time
[52:01] after
[52:04] Lord before Christ would go into prayer
[52:06] in
[52:09] GTH he spoke a lot all those
[52:14] chapters chapter 13 chapter 14 chapter
[52:18] 15 chapter 16 chapter
[52:22] 17 before he was was arrested
[52:27] and there are
[52:29] scriptures they are the
[52:31] scriptures that teach more about the
[52:34] holy
[52:37] spirit that speak more about the
[52:41] comforter than you can go in other parts
[52:44] of the
[52:46] Bible and then you cannot say I have the
[52:50] comforter I can say I have the Holy
[52:53] Spirit and I can afford to hate another
[52:57] person there's no Holy Spirit there now
[53:01] praise the name of Lord because you
[53:02] can't separate
[53:04] them praise the name of our Lord you
[53:07] cannot so he says when the spirit of
[53:10] Truth is
[53:12] come he will guide you into all
[53:16] truth how can you have all
[53:19] truth which is the word and you can
[53:23] afford to hurt
[53:25] to you are fortable
[53:29] hating you know you are contented to
[53:34] hate you are contented to
[53:42] talk you are you are you are contented
[53:45] to despise
[53:49] others you can't you can't say that the
[53:52] Holy Spirit
[53:53] now because he will guide you into all
[53:59] Truth for you will not of the body of
[54:04] Christ until you live a holy
[54:10] life God refuses your
[54:14] sacrifice God demands our
[54:19] obedience you know much more than the
[54:22] sacrifices we can
[54:25] make because if if you're not obedient
[54:27] to
[54:28] God how will he hear your
[54:32] prayer but then the Bible
[54:34] says ears of
[54:37] God praise the name of Lord they they
[54:42] want to hear the prayers of the
[54:45] righteous believe that is in the book of
[54:49] Peter praise the name of the Lord wish I
[54:52] can get it
[54:53] first it's in the book of First Peter
[55:01] first pter
[55:06] 5 okay we can start reading from
[55:12] verse verse
[55:16] 6 he says humble yourselves therefore
[55:19] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[55:20] exalt you in due time
[55:34] casting all your care unto him for he
[55:52] cares be sober be be vigilant
[55:59] because your adversary devil as a ring
[56:01] lion walth about seeking whom he
[56:13] might praise the name of the Lord I'm
[56:16] failing to get let us go to Proverbs
[56:18] [Music]
[56:22] 15:8 prover 158
[56:29] the Bible
[56:32] says the sacrifice of the wicked is an
[56:36] Abomination to the Lord but the prayer
[56:39] of the upright is his
[56:50] Delight The Way of the Wicked is an
[56:52] Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth
[56:55] him that follow follows after
[57:04] righteous praise the name of the Lord so
[57:07] then how will you offer your
[57:10] sacrifices and then God reject
[57:13] them because you are not obedient to the
[57:17] word so then we need to start with
[57:21] obedience and then we bring our
[57:23] sacrifices
[57:26] like like Cain and
[57:29] Abel the Bible says God did not have
[57:38] respect did not have
[57:42] respectto and his
[57:44] sacrifice so it first starts with
[57:47] you and then what you
[57:50] do it says but God had respect unto Abel
[58:00] let us go to Genesis chapter
[58:03] 4 praise the name of the
[58:06] Lord and then verse
[58:08] three and in the process of time it came
[58:11] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[58:14] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[58:27] and Abel he also brought of the fings of
[58:30] his flock and of the fat thereof and the
[58:33] Lord had respect unto abto his
[58:49] offering and his offering he had no
[58:52] respect and Cain was very Ro and his
[59:06] praise the name of our Lord so he says
[59:08] he had respect unto
[59:11] Abel and then his
[59:15] offering he had respect unto
[59:19] Abel why his
[59:22] life was acceptable to God so even his
[59:28] sacrifices were accepted to
[59:31] God but now Cain his life was not
[59:37] accepted so even what he
[59:40] did the sacrifices he
[59:43] made he rejected
[59:46] them and then now you see here how the
[59:48] comforter comes in
[59:53] now now the comforter
[59:56] because here the Bible says in
[59:59] verse and the Lord said unto
[1:00:03] Cain why are you
[1:00:08] R praise the name of the Lord he's
[1:00:11] coming into guide
[1:00:13] you that what you have done is
[1:00:17] wrong but there is a way you can make
[1:00:21] amendments praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:25] and why is th Contin
[1:00:31] Fallen if you do
[1:00:35] well shall th not be
[1:00:42] accepted you know so the Holy
[1:00:45] Spirit comes and guides
[1:00:48] you comes and corrects
[1:00:51] you and say this thing you have done is
[1:00:54] not right
[1:00:56] look what
[1:00:58] Moses when God told Moses speak to the
[1:01:02] Rock Andes the another
[1:01:08] time corrected
[1:01:10] him you have done is not
[1:01:13] right and then God is
[1:01:17] telling why is your Contin
[1:01:22] fall why are you w
[1:01:26] praise the name of the Lord say you do
[1:01:29] well and you will be
[1:01:32] accepted but came didn't hear the Holy
[1:01:36] Spirit he rejected the
[1:01:39] instruction and so he ended up in
[1:01:44] Father praise the name of the Lord just
[1:01:47] like the men in John chapter
[1:01:51] 8 they got the woman who had committed
[1:01:54] adultery
[1:01:58] and then they brought her to the Lord
[1:01:59] Jesus
[1:02:00] Christ in the temple and then they said
[1:02:04] this woman and the Bible
[1:02:07] says one by
[1:02:09] one when they heard that
[1:02:12] word they were
[1:02:14] convicted and when they were convicted
[1:02:17] did they
[1:02:19] repent they just went
[1:02:21] away so now when the Holy Spirit
[1:02:24] convicts us
[1:02:28] say Lord have mercy upon
[1:02:31] me praise the name of our Lord ask go to
[1:02:34] reconcile
[1:02:36] you Lord deliver me in this
[1:02:41] weakness deliver me from this kind of
[1:02:45] failure that's how you can have
[1:02:47] continuous communion with the Holy
[1:02:52] Spirit we can bring it to ourselves now
[1:02:56] you have somebody you're talking
[1:02:58] with he's telling you this you are
[1:03:02] disagreeing with
[1:03:03] him can you continue
[1:03:07] conversing he says this says no that's
[1:03:11] not right no I can't accept that you are
[1:03:14] shutting
[1:03:16] them you you you know but now the Holy
[1:03:19] Ghost is teaching us the
[1:03:21] word we
[1:03:23] said me I don't care what you telling
[1:03:27] me he keeps
[1:03:29] quiet and that's what the scripture says
[1:03:33] grieve not the Holy
[1:03:38] Spirit know
[1:03:42] don't because you are
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:45] rebelling so you are cutting off your
[1:03:50] fellowship with the Holy Spirit praise
[1:03:53] the name of our Lord
[1:03:56] now in that
[1:03:58] message let us go back to the Ephesian
[1:04:00] Church
[1:04:02] age I'm finding it her to
[1:04:05] finish praise the name of our Lord see
[1:04:09] my time is
[1:04:12] up he
[1:04:18] says the high priest before he could
[1:04:20] even come in to offer the
[1:04:24] sacrifice he had to be
[1:04:28] holy and
[1:04:30] dedicated and
[1:04:33] anointed and
[1:04:36] perfumed and everything before he could
[1:04:39] even walk in the presence of
[1:04:43] God to offer
[1:04:47] sacrifice is that right then how can you
[1:04:51] go out
[1:04:53] here and cheat
[1:04:56] and
[1:04:57] steal and
[1:05:02] F and fight with your
[1:05:05] neighbors and everything
[1:05:07] else and carrying on the way you
[1:05:12] do and then come
[1:05:14] in and say oh Lord
[1:05:18] God Praise Jesus
[1:05:22] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[1:05:25] the Lord
[1:05:26] and sometimes when you go to some of
[1:05:27] these
[1:05:29] churches you see some of those who want
[1:05:32] to be so
[1:05:35] spiritual when you can continue further
[1:05:38] into their
[1:05:40] life you said this is contrary to what
[1:05:42] they they reflect in
[1:05:46] church they want the
[1:05:49] sacrifice but the life is contrary to
[1:05:51] what they
[1:05:53] doing people say I I people say I I see
[1:05:57] them speaking
[1:06:00] tongues
[1:06:02] that that don't mean they got the Holy
[1:06:06] Ghost I hear them
[1:06:08] shout still that don't mean they got the
[1:06:11] Holy
[1:06:13] Ghost the Holy
[1:06:16] Ghost is the
[1:06:18] life praise the name of our Lord the
[1:06:20] life of Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ praise the name of our Lord and
[1:06:25] so that we should always desire more of
[1:06:28] God in our
[1:06:30] lives and you know the more of God you
[1:06:35] have is the more of God gives you more
[1:06:39] grace in the different
[1:06:43] challenges because he gives you the
[1:06:46] strength to do his word praise the name
[1:06:49] of our Lord he helps you praise the name
[1:06:53] of our Lord now let me try I
[1:06:57] conclude I think we shall continue on
[1:06:59] this next week on
[1:07:03] Wednesday praise the name of our
[1:07:06] Lord now let us go to John 15 and then
[1:07:10] verse
[1:07:15] 26 he
[1:07:16] says but when the comforter is come whom
[1:07:20] I will send unto you from the father
[1:07:22] even the spirit of Truth which proceeds
[1:07:25] from the father he will testify of me
[1:07:28] and you shall also bear witness because
[1:07:31] you have been with me from the beginning
[1:07:58] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[1:08:00] when the Holy Spirit
[1:08:02] comes you know he will testify of what
[1:08:06] the Lord
[1:08:10] is that's what the Holy Ghost will
[1:08:13] do he will testify that which is of
[1:08:18] god so he will not come and speak his
[1:08:22] own
[1:08:24] things praise the name of our Lord but
[1:08:27] to just give us that which is the Lord
[1:08:32] is praise the name of the Lord so the
[1:08:36] Holy
[1:08:37] Spirit when he is
[1:08:40] come and he says it's the spirit of
[1:08:44] Truth which comes from the
[1:08:47] father who testify about the Lord Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ praise the name of our Lord he
[1:08:54] testifies about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:57] and what is that testimony
[1:09:02] like the word of
[1:09:05] God the Holy Ghost will endeavor to keep
[1:09:08] you in the
[1:09:10] word because the word comes from the
[1:09:14] spirit it's the spirit of God that
[1:09:17] speaks to
[1:09:19] us and you know when we are obedient to
[1:09:22] the
[1:09:23] word praise the name of our
[1:09:26] then then that's
[1:09:27] when the spirit of God can Quicken that
[1:09:34] word can make that word
[1:09:38] alive and then you are able to manifest
[1:09:41] the word which has been spoken to
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] you so you hear the spirit
[1:09:48] speaking you obey what the spirit has
[1:09:50] told
[1:09:51] you and then the spirit is the rain
[1:09:56] praise the name of the Lord and then he
[1:09:58] comes and makes That Word
[1:10:00] Alive he quickens that word and that
[1:10:04] word becomes alive in our
[1:10:07] lives praise the name of the Lord let me
[1:10:10] just give maybe some kind of scenario
[1:10:14] here let us go back to the issue of
[1:10:17] hatred you know you hear the word of
[1:10:21] God don't hate your
[1:10:23] enemy and then you hate your enemy the
[1:10:27] Holy Ghost convicts
[1:10:29] you what you're doing is not right then
[1:10:32] you go cry to the Lord Lord deliver me
[1:10:35] from this Spirit of hatred Lord deliver
[1:10:38] me from this Spirit of hatred and you
[1:10:40] know the Holy Ghost is a
[1:10:42] teacher and the Holy Ghost teaches by
[1:10:50] practical God does not
[1:10:53] assume he'll bring your
[1:10:57] around and find out have you learned or
[1:11:00] you have not
[1:11:01] learned then you see that is done who
[1:11:04] has come where you are I don't know why
[1:11:07] that what's wrong with that
[1:11:08] person and the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:11] watching then you remember I'm not meant
[1:11:14] to H
[1:11:15] him okay let me bear with him being
[1:11:18] around and then you say Let Me Wait if
[1:11:20] you will greet
[1:11:22] me he doesn't greet you pretend as if
[1:11:25] he's not
[1:11:28] there and then later you feel I did
[1:11:32] wrong again another
[1:11:35] time okay how are you
[1:11:37] sir you becoming
[1:11:40] better the first time you were running
[1:11:44] away the second time you bear to be
[1:11:48] around the third time you're saying how
[1:11:50] are you
[1:11:52] sir the next time you say how is home
[1:11:55] how is
[1:11:56] what the things he has done to you have
[1:11:59] completely gone
[1:12:01] away your heart is free from what he did
[1:12:04] Evil to
[1:12:05] you you're not afraid of him and then he
[1:12:09] will start
[1:12:10] wondering who is this kind of person I
[1:12:14] did for them this bad
[1:12:16] thing but they now they they have
[1:12:19] nothing against
[1:12:21] me the Holy Ghost is a
[1:12:24] teacher takes us through
[1:12:30] practical
[1:12:34] science you don't just calculate but you
[1:12:36] measure like when they in chemistry lab
[1:12:39] they say measure two me of this or five
[1:12:42] Mills of this you are passing through
[1:12:44] them and observing what
[1:12:50] happens not like you did electrical you
[1:12:52] don't say you know electric if you
[1:12:54] cannot join wires
[1:12:58] you just only theoretical but then when
[1:13:00] they give you wires you don't know black
[1:13:02] goes where red goes where you must know
[1:13:05] those are the practical the Holy Ghost
[1:13:07] takes us
[1:13:09] through praise the name of the Lord real
[1:13:12] things a real
[1:13:16] issue praise the name of the Lord life
[1:13:21] it's not an
[1:13:22] assumption he takes you through that
[1:13:26] condition a good example is about
[1:13:30] Abraham God didn't just assume Abraham
[1:13:33] loves me and obeys me a
[1:13:37] lot but he told
[1:13:39] Abraham take your
[1:13:42] son your only son and give him a
[1:13:46] sacrifice to
[1:13:47] me praise the name of our Lord and then
[1:13:51] Abraham woke up in the
[1:13:53] morning he didn't tell anybody what he
[1:13:55] was going to
[1:13:56] do but he told the servants you carried
[1:14:02] firewood carried the fire he told Isaac
[1:14:05] let us go to
[1:14:07] worship and then he moved for about 3
[1:14:09] days or
[1:14:12] so and then when he reached
[1:14:15] somewhere God showed him with the
[1:14:18] mountain say that's the place I want you
[1:14:20] to sacrifice
[1:14:23] Isa ABR now didn't start saying oh God
[1:14:25] but this is my only son no he didn't he
[1:14:28] didn't buy time to
[1:14:31] wait maybe God will forget what he has
[1:14:34] told he woke up in the
[1:14:38] morning he woke up in the
[1:14:41] morning showing his obedience to what
[1:14:44] God has told
[1:14:46] him and even when he reached and God
[1:14:48] showed him the
[1:14:50] mountain say now AB I know you are
[1:14:52] serious you stop here
[1:14:57] he allowed him to
[1:14:59] go until he reached the
[1:15:02] place he laid the
[1:15:05] altar he bundled up his
[1:15:08] son and then he got a knife to cut
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:19] his not an assumption and then the Lord
[1:15:23] say don't don't don't have seen that you
[1:15:24] do
[1:15:26] this praise the name of the Lord so the
[1:15:29] holy spirit is our
[1:15:33] teacher praise the name of our Lord he
[1:15:36] teaches us and go gives us the grace to
[1:15:38] go through all these
[1:15:41] things praise the name of our Lord now
[1:15:44] in the message day what is the Holy
[1:15:48] Ghost he says Now The Advocate found in
[1:15:53] 1 John 2:
[1:16:01] we can first go and pick that scripture
[1:16:03] in first
[1:16:05] John 1 John 2 verse1 and
[1:16:12] verse verse one and verse
[1:16:15] two I think we may end up with
[1:16:19] that and then next time the Lord being
[1:16:23] gracious can go in the Holy Ghost being
[1:16:27] a comforter as the
[1:16:34] intercessor and the high
[1:16:36] priest interceding for
[1:16:39] us so now in first John 2 verse1
[1:16:46] verse2 the scripture says
[1:16:58] my little children these things right I
[1:17:00] unto you that you sin not and if any man
[1:17:03] sin we have an advocate with the father
[1:17:06] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:17:08] propitiation for our sins and not for
[1:17:11] ours only but also for the sins of the
[1:17:13] whole world
[1:17:39] praise the name of the Lord so he says
[1:17:42] my little
[1:17:44] children I write unto
[1:17:46] you that you sin
[1:17:50] not now you look at that scripture is
[1:17:52] very interesting
[1:17:56] he says don't
[1:17:59] sin but that's not the end of the
[1:18:03] scripture but it says if in man
[1:18:10] sin we have an
[1:18:14] advocate with the
[1:18:16] father Jesus Christ the
[1:18:21] righteous so in other
[1:18:23] words if you sin
[1:18:26] that's not your
[1:18:27] end praise the name of Lord he says we
[1:18:30] have an
[1:18:33] advocate we have a
[1:18:36] comforter so what do you do you say Lord
[1:18:39] have mercy
[1:18:41] upon Lord deliver me from this kind of
[1:18:45] weakness praise the name of our Lord
[1:18:47] because he's our
[1:18:49] comforter he our
[1:18:51] advocate he is our enaer
[1:18:55] praise the name of the Lord now don't
[1:18:58] allow
[1:19:01] Satan to make you do something
[1:19:04] wrong and after you have done something
[1:19:07] wrong then Satan tells
[1:19:10] you this is your end
[1:19:13] now or leave
[1:19:17] church
[1:19:19] or destroy
[1:19:23] yourself not because they there are
[1:19:25] things which are very
[1:19:27] strange I think I heard of somebody here
[1:19:29] in ginger
[1:19:33] sometime I think either he was a pastor
[1:19:36] or
[1:19:38] somebody he was
[1:19:41] adulter and then afterwards he committed
[1:19:46] suicide what was he preaching about
[1:19:51] Grace praise the name of our Lord how do
[1:19:53] you preach about Grace for you that
[1:19:55] Grace cannot come and help
[1:19:59] you now it does not mean that you do
[1:20:01] that because there is
[1:20:04] Grace but the thing is if you have
[1:20:08] really met
[1:20:10] Christ in times of
[1:20:14] weakness we have a high
[1:20:17] priest praise the name of our Lord you
[1:20:19] said Lord help me in
[1:20:22] dist Lord deliver in this kind of
[1:20:26] condition like David he committed
[1:20:31] adultery and then he
[1:20:34] killed and now when the prophet comes to
[1:20:38] him and the prophet tells him
[1:20:43] theable you know when it is a
[1:20:47] parable and you don't have the
[1:20:50] understanding of
[1:20:52] it you are self right
[1:20:57] yes that's what David
[1:20:59] was he had committed
[1:21:02] adultery he had
[1:21:04] mured was
[1:21:06] comfortable one whole
[1:21:09] year then the prophet came and gave him
[1:21:11] that
[1:21:13] Parable it was a book which is
[1:21:18] sealed just like the book is
[1:21:21] sealed when they read that baptized in
[1:21:23] the name of the father the Son and the
[1:21:25] Holy
[1:21:27] Ghost they say we doing what Jesus
[1:21:30] say but it's a parable to
[1:21:33] them it is sealed to
[1:21:36] them and they are saying that I've done
[1:21:39] what Jesus
[1:21:41] said because it is still
[1:21:44] sealed but now when the prophet broke
[1:21:46] the
[1:21:48] seal David knew I'm the
[1:21:52] man who needs to be to repent
[1:21:57] so even these people when they are
[1:21:59] looking at that
[1:22:03] mystery
[1:22:08] self they get
[1:22:11] Revelation they know that they need to
[1:22:13] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:22:15] Jesus
[1:22:17] Christ so under under the
[1:22:20] seal when the book was still sealed
[1:22:25] as a
[1:22:26] parable David said that man who did that
[1:22:29] needs to be
[1:22:32] killed he had already made
[1:22:35] judgment but now when the prophet told
[1:22:37] him you are the
[1:22:41] man he made his
[1:22:45] F but said Lord have upon
[1:22:49] me praise the name of Lord much as I did
[1:22:52] answer the other thing foolishly
[1:22:56] I committed
[1:22:58] adultery I killed even
[1:23:02] sentencing I said that person needs to
[1:23:06] die but now I find
[1:23:10] myself what do I do Lord have Mery upon
[1:23:14] me praise the name of our Lord that's
[1:23:17] where the advocate comes
[1:23:20] in and then the prophet told this King
[1:23:25] God has forgiven you he has taken away
[1:23:28] your sin and you're not going to
[1:23:31] die we need an
[1:23:33] advocate praise the name of Lord and an
[1:23:36] advocate
[1:23:38] works when you admit your
[1:23:42] weaknesses like we talked about
[1:23:45] recognizing your
[1:23:48] weaknesses acknowledging your
[1:23:50] weaknesses like in the scripture in
[1:23:52] Psalms 51
[1:23:57] praise the name of our Lord where David
[1:24:00] says I
[1:24:04] knowledge I
[1:24:06] confess he says Psalms
[1:24:10] 51 and verse
[1:24:12] three for I acknowledge my
[1:24:14] transgressions and my sin is ever before
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:22] me so you tell the
[1:24:25] vate your
[1:24:27] weaknesses your
[1:24:29] failures Lord this is where I need your
[1:24:33] help Lord this is where I need your
[1:24:36] deliverance praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:39] we have an advocate with the
[1:24:43] father our Lord Jesus Christ praise the
[1:24:46] name of our Lord so see that you confess
[1:24:49] to the
[1:24:51] Lord you reconcile to the Lord
