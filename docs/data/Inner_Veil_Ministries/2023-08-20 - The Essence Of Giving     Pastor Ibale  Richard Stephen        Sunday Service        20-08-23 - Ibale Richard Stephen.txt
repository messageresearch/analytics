goodness amen amen foreign [Music] and uh my family is not here apart from my wife Amen in Nairobi for quite some bit of time and they also send their greetings [Applause] is a blessing to be a child of God and to know that you are Iran amen amen that's a very great blessing amen amen I just don't know where to begin from but I trust that the Lord will help us to do the best we can this morning as I was waking up and she already went back the Holy Spirit spoke to my heart about Divine Fellowship amen just not Fellowship coming together like we do a Divine Palace so by grace that will be our next area of coverage amen amen so this coming weekend is going to be wedded here so we just pray for them that the Lord may be gracious and bless them and so they stand there after we shallah brother Robert kabasi ministering without an organizer amen amen and he is going to do the wedding also amen amen so let's just stand up and get into the scripture reading we shall turn to the Book of John chapter 3 verse 16. amen amen for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son believeth in him should not perish I remember but have everlasting life let's pray one more time father Baba that seems to be the most precious scripture father that when you loved us into what we end up you gave us your only begotten son we thank you for that giving and I pray that you may open up our hearts as we feed from that central point of scripture bless the hearts [Music] build them in a special way in Jesus name amen amen amenated so for a title this morning I want to speak on the essence of giving um the wealth of value of one transferring amen ownership so you take this which is yours and you transfer it in ownership that it has left you and it has gone to the ownership of Another Universe therefore the essence of giving would mean what you in giving a man amen amen which in itself is a particular Grace amen amen without that particular Grace nobody can be able to give us so in second Corinthians chapter 8 [Music] on the churches of Macedonia now the church is under the saving grace of God but then Paul is talking about another Grace given unto them another definition of Grace was bestowed unto them so how that in a great trial of afflictions and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality amen support singles out the church that was in great try of Affliction [Music] and yet it was moved together then Paul calls it a special manifestation of the grace a special section of Grace a special manifestation of Grace that the grace that saves us pushes out different manifestations of stream [Applause] so in second Corinthians chapter 8 verse he says therefore as he abound in everything I mean all diligence also [Music] but he says let this grace abound also so I speak not by Commandments but by occasion of the foreign Randy and to prove the sincerity of your life amen to prove the sincerity of your life is telling the Corinthians but giving is the special Grace we want to look under that Grace and to touch the essence of giving together we are taking on a nature of the father because it's Grace that gifts that's why brother I mean in verse I speak not by Commandments but by occasions of forwardness to prove the sincerity of Your Love okay always is something that goes a lot further than monetary offerings amen so I'm not really speaking about giving out money in church giving out your ties and everything but the answers touching the nature of the father amen because the love of the father it gives and this is what I'm trying to bring forth this morning that as long as you've got the nature of the father you'll have the ability to gain and this giving here is not limited to the money you are able to give so I want you to understand that's why I'm calling you to the essence of giving it so I'm speaking deeper than the ability to give what you give another brother but I'm speaking about the nature that lays behind the acts amen Amina yes in verse 26 foreign [Music] [Music] can be able to be noticed or Survivor be seen in another form she is [Music] man his image and likeness so that man can share in the spiritual quality of God you know God transferred part of what he was to adaptation are you together with me that is giving yeah it includes you know we give the authority and nurture that Adam I want you to share in what I amen Amina So Adam came forth under the glory of God and also dwote in the same Dimension with God [Music] amen so that he can exercise Dominion by that nature amen Amina in the adoption message brother Branham says he said I am Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existence [Music] who has created something off of myself to be a son of man um Jehovah means that God gave man to be a number to God because his father God and he made man and not much so is itself existence anymore he exists with his family amen now she is Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family [Music] he gave a part of himself away therefore show us in the quality of God are you together with me he makes him to be an amateur God that's what God intended when he created I am all existence ones who has created something yet into off of my myself so this paper here is all that God is but he says I've taken something off of myself amen I've taken off something off of myself so that out of the Peace of myself I have given him my likeness I have given him my image Finance amen the essence of giving praise the Lord so that's the essence [Music] [Music] you know and animals that he was supposed to have dominion foreign [Music] [Applause] governor you cannot be able to give amen Amina so Romans chapter 12. I want you to see this depth here and verse 6. he says having 10 gifts according to the grace that's given to us let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith is amen Amina because you are under grace you can receive from the father or yes multiple gifts and consider that a transferring of ownership are you together with the man what is it God transferring from what he is because in God is healing and God is the pastorship is the Evangelist amen Amina yes those are his gifts they are different Natures of God but God says I am going to give you and when you receive use what I've given you in the proportion of faith foreign [Music] are you together with them those are all Goods elements of God and then he gives them out to you so that you are now required to use the gifts of God of nice work because and then he says he that gives us let him do it with the simplistic because genuine giving away is generated by love [Applause] are you together with me you cannot give with an attitude I'm giving to you because you are poor that one is not giving I'm giving you liquor because you cannot manage to do your wedding that's not God and you use very big words to describe that's not giving let him that give us do it with the simplest are you together with me what is it so in that you know he says after that in verse 9. let love be without the simulation are you together with me now you see he's talking about giving gifts but they are administered so in the first giving when God made a man a substance it's love that proceeded to create men amen Amina he just said let us and once God moves is the movement of love I'll take a part of myself amen and transfer ownership to another form amen that would be a lower means praise God so and when man fell still love it [Music] to go and save man so giving best colors he says but God commandeth his love toward Sacrament Christ died for us so when God is love goes ahead are you together with me when is it even when you are giving you should do let love proceed and once love proceeds that is love stands at the center of giving he packaged his own life I mean he packaged his own life yes to the Fallen [Applause] world's wrapped gifts amen amen in swaddling clothes and God gave his son as a gift to the world Amen Amina in giving we don't look at what we are giving but we look at the principle in giving because is love stepping foreign [Music] stepped down today are you together with me what is it amen Amina so he comes down I want to show you here in Leviticus chapter 17. because the Bible says give his own son to be a preposition some of the same in there Amen to be a propagation [Music] he gave because there was a need are you together with me if you are in love and you see a need love proceeds you you don't reduce a brother to becoming a beggar to offers everything you see there is you don't wait for him to ask for a shirt when God suddenly God this is what God wants to work with us even in giving in our in church giving among our souls we give because we have got a love together which proceeds to meet the need to go amen Amina when you saw the need of redemption could not proceed I mean I could not withhold his own side quality for God so loved the world [Music] [Applause] and when he gave he gets the Sun but the son I don't mind let's go to Leviticus 17 11. this scripture here it is a new testament application [Music] he has given us the lives foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] 13. [Music] [Applause] that is God giving children are you together with me it was love foreign [Music] is referred to as the gifts it is [Music] in the body of the church when he's speaking about that he says ye shall receive according to me therefore now the gift of the Holy Ghost how can you receive unless there is a giving Allah foreign [Music] could that choose the body from the judgments of sins how much more when God gives the gifts of his own life hallelujah it's not only your flesh which is Exempted from judgments before [Music] [Applause] [Music] so is [Music] [Music] the blood goes right there why for God so loved the world so this life would then get to this song that's the greatest gift which we call the gift of life amen Amen Let us look at another dimension of giving here in Ephesians chapter 4 verses and verse 11. he says it is God himself is the life behind the five-fold minutes [Applause] are you together with me but he gives some Amen to be apostles and teachers the essence of giving revealing the nature of God and then he says you know when God gives he doesn't give for you to be dormant with what he has given um is because of the purpose foreign [Music] and when he gives these gifts it is John 3 16 being extended amen amen it's an extension of John 3 16. it always remains the foundation of giving us amen amen so Ephesians 4 11. anointed given as gift to the church yeah Hallelujah so when you stand out there and you look at the picture of the word standing in front of you that is a gift to benefit you okay Hallelujah yes that's God giving a portion of himself and he gave his son we see that he gives these gifts to extend John 3 16. I'm redeeming ability the gift is not for me you might think that's your gifts brother Branham says the gift is not for me I cannot use it for myself it is for you you are the one that gives the benefit not me [Music] I'm just a public servant of God to you Hallelujah so you've got a right to return this ministry called your pastor of course you said that's my gift and to pray for that again because he sent to the church from God amen the preacher is a public server he just holds himself there yeah like a lily of the field amen the lady of the field is so beautiful it has got beautiful flowers are you together with me yeah it is the public servant who produces beautiful flowers and then the people when they watch they say my look at the beauty of that Lady of the Valley when the people look at it they say you need that flower yeah when the bill looks at it the big goes and sacks from there to benefit it because the gift is not mine [Applause] are you together with me what is it the Bumblebee flies and gets his back the bypass against trees to be a giver foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so what do we need to do is learn how to offer of ourselves so that we can be a blessing to the body if you are a musician you do not just come here pray that we don't know and play things out of keys you must dedicate yourself to give or you know are you together with me what is it amen amen the Lord blesses you with good money don't think that makes you a special person and you use the better language you just need to be humble because that comes from God we don't use our gifts right God can take them away engage for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten himself after giving and you receive then God demands that's First John 3 16 let's go there University [Music] to give because God gave me I benefited from Ephesians 4 11. and he gave some to be Apostles and once you receive you give him simplest things we become to focus the extension of the ministry of Christ we tell you to give like a doctor Lily a pastor studies to be able to give you don't come here when you have nothing to give the difference the essence of giving are you together with me amen you know then my Sugar's been high and high and high through the week brother James came to the house but it's a responsibility I have to come understand it foreign [Applause] that's the giving God desires of us if I be lifted up from the earth went away let our lives in a sense of Simplicity to preach Christ in our work that's the greatest Ministry so we need to take the revelation of this message so God has raised us up in this last day is in itself by living the life of Christo you are being able to give us the essence of giving don't look at it from the top of it here we ought to live and live I mean a giving life missionaries foreign [Music] [Applause] that's the way the servant [Applause] opens himself up just to take from me amen amen he just opens up there's nothing for himself he said it's for others that's what Christ become when he become king folks to us amen he became a man but the world might partake of his righteousness and be made sons of God hallelujah eternal life is living forever haha but when you think this is my life I have to live my life that's not a Christian Style we live 12 for others we are giving the one we live our life is the giving thank you look at the parable of the tariffs it hides another Essence is the more we get back yes it is it teaches that three people were given different measures basing on their different abilities of management so one two five Titan and never took three years foreign [Applause] amen amen if God makes you a musician that will never fall or maybe multiply the talent challenge every gift you have foreign started to ask for what Peter did not have yeah Peter looked at him and told him such as I have yeah I give entropy so every child of God he has got a channel that he drinks in from the stream of the Holy Spirit and when you drink it shall flow rivers of Living Water amen there will always be something for you together when I started out in the ministry I started listening to the forefathers foreign [Music] [Applause] now again huh let me preach it around in a different way here let's go to Isaiah 55. he says so shall my word be according to make sure that goeth out from my mouth again it shall not return unto me voice that which I please he says I can never send my word according and my word fails sometimes we are talking about the promises [Music] so when you go out as a gifts when you stand in your position and Jesus said yes as my father sent me yours praise the Lord amen so let us look at the word as promises now John 3 I mean 6 63. he says it is the spirit that quickness [Applause] but flesh profess nothing the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit moyo and they are life such as I have is so when God brings you into the body He blesses you under a specific way of understanding him okay and now when you really catch the revelation of who that Christ is [Music] positioning then he must make sure that he quickens that gifts and when you go out double from the Holy Spirit stands behind that gift to back it up as I told you the other time that First Corinthians 13. charity must stand behind every gift and the Charities the life God himself now listen he chose to deal with the intellectual prowess of a man yes but God chose the heart but [Applause] to the hearts God ministers life from the same message are you hearing what I say if you are a True Believer God will affect your heart and make it flood the issues of Life you'll be able to understand we cannot be like one another foreign [Applause] are you together with it because you are supposed to preach life to the people who want to amen amen not preach one another to preach the Life of Christ too I don't come here to preach how special yeah I know that I'm just a little peace in the calling of God and as I stand in front of us I recognize every one of you to be part to say amen amen pick up the letter of the message and use it like he did in the garden he can give the letter is a false application but he cannot as well Minister it is amen exactly amen because he cannot go behind that scripture [Music] to give it to you [Music] he remains with the letter there is no way out of that message the devil can ever emphasize the life of the world because that life is the life of the blood I'm the devil understand that's going to want anything to do with the blood foreign [Music] it's not good enough for you to come here to know that you are in the message because you have been baptized right you dress right yeah you you know you you are a very decent person this message is not about being paid I mean decent Church it goes deeper than that it's touching the Life of Christ foreign [Music] Temple Ministers of the New Testament yes you are also an evil minister of the new testamentium if you understand the New Testament he says this is my new testament yeah which is your life it says not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killer that the spirit giveth life we are not in the world until what we know translates into life are you together with me what is it yeah because if you are in it by understanding it or wrote together it will stop here but if the Holy Ghost ministers to your soul I remember it will produce life and you know this is where we are going when we are talking about Divine fellowships amen amen Divine fellas not just being in church here but a Divine Fellowship it must be God foreign Divine Fellowship so the word of God is Not voided it returns manifestation it is so shall my word but goeth out of my mouth it shall not return voice amen Amina God is Not vain in his words because his Spirit Warrior and life when that God Goes Forth it creates a body of a manifestation the body of Jesus Christ it builds the body around it up my God a body so that we can become the body of the world and that this external body is a manifestation of what God is doing on this side of us amen amen so the words that I speak unto your spirit and life meaning that under the spoken word they are lazy creative anointing he was so God's word has got enough power the transform itself into living substance [Music] it is a revelation of the Life of Christ amen amen let's go to this court here in the third see he says before it's a word it is a thought has to be created so God's thoughts become creation when it was Spock so when I speak the words of eternal life I'm creating you by the word into new creatures God has given us that ability to bring to you that creative work okay the prophet says that you happy that today better what God makes every word manifest he doesn't speak I don't wow but he speaks every word just exactly amen he doesn't speak vain words so when we come down here with the gift God has given to us and we speak to you and you receive it as God's word enough creative power behind me yeah he doesn't speak when he says foreign foreign because it's a creative world the world must bear a fruit must come alive because it's in itself essence of giving um it became part of him and the guy was asking for money [Music] I'm not able to give nothing is what I can give best water churches it's not sharing money but everybody has got something to eat praise the Lord amen we need to see another principle here before I finish Luke chapter six foreign [Music] foreign foreign this is a very great scripture which is used but when you look at it he uses the principle that stands out both amen amen in the negative which container and in the positive when you act negative towards the people you will permanently reap multiply the negativity but if you give life out to positively you will get back positivity from among other people [Applause] give out positive be good to your brothers that is so Christ calculation is teaching giving I told myself foreign [Applause] praise the Lord II Corinthians foreign foreign [Music] see he says let's uplift them of Macedonia come with me and find you and prepare we should be ashamed in this same confident boasting a command to Faith because the Corinthian Church he says in your busting how much are you giving what of those of Macedonia the men under that Grace when they come down here and they see the love of the church if you are not prepared even to give your time don't care quiet now be positive say man is amen I mean he encourages the church in accordance to project into the grace that gives Christians needs to find an opportunity to give from the heart find an opportunity maybe others may be abusing that opportunity amen Amina and brother you know I don't have something to eat yes but find an opportunity the answers [Music] I wanna he says in verse 5. therefore I found it necessary to exhort president that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your Bounty that's okay whereof he had not before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as a matter of covetousness of covetousness praise the Lord he's saying that it's necessary to encourage in the natural principles you will not go on the first Traders so that God helps you to get money to solve your school fees he has principles foreign the principle is based on work and be able to give us will bless your body every interview somebody say man there you don't come down here because they are taking my distance because you don't understand the essence are you together with me what is it so he says it's necessary to prepare you okay the Corinthian Church the Corinthian Church was a growing child it started with a lot of weaknesses amen because they were segregating among themselves we don't live a Christian Life we are together one body are you together with me those problems foreign but they kept growing and growing immacula and growing at the end of the day it's the church which poor Paulo gave most of the revelations he taught them about our new body he told them how he went beyond the curtain of time he told them how the Rapture will come yeah it was not willing to give yeah for me amen Amina he says but I say he with so a sparing you know shall Reapers [Music] and then Paul comes down here on the principle you stand on in order to be able to give okay he says every man according as the purposes in his heart according it's not you giving generation so that you can come on the record of those who pay times that's not what we give tonight it is a foundation of life goes up not grudgingly for God but you give and you say we gave you are yeah no no no no no no no no no no let the heart becoming and joyfully amen amen and did God listen and God is able electrons to make all grace abound toward you say that you're always having all suffices [Applause] again huh some Grace also describes a definite calling okay to which god cartoon has called us what we say and it's a magnitude era money to bless the body you love him amen amen Ecclesiastes chapter 11. I love the wisdom of solomots [Music] has builded himself he recognized himself yet again and he called himself wisdom do we have wisdom here praise the Lord look at the wisdom of Solomon you see one time I preached a series on giving and I took in the service one I mean one of the scriptures I used chapter 11. he says cast thy bread upon the waters for Thou shalt find it after many days how do we give together give a portion to seven and also ate for thou no is not what evil shall be upon the Earth when the World Bank withholds back its money yes and it shall return after many days that this means down there in the chain of the movements of the water it moves in such a circles because you can ask yourself you see which means that that water yes that's the wisdom of Souls and he says the waters goes in the circuits [Applause] amen amen it brings back to your place so in the understanding of it because thy bread upon the Water amen amen and the waters here speaks about people Nations he's saying that share out your blessings among your brothers be able to give when you have to keep and once you put your offering in there it's going to come back and I told you the priest foreign foreign [Applause] Solomon is saying that practicing giving into color practice giving because because that's the only way you can retain what you have questions that's the way you can retain your business you can be able to retain your fruitfulness in your family yeah praise the Lord he says that it comes back to you and not only back to you foreign let's stand up cut women do you love him um do you feel blessed this morning amen amen life is about giving nature gives us seasons the ground gives us vegetation the skies everything gives us rain to nurture our vegetation the son gives us his light and heat is about giving foreign let's just give handle praise to the Lord foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] what would you give what would you give
