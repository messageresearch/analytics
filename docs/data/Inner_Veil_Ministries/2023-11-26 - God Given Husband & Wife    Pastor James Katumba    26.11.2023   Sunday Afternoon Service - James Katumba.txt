TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for any reason praise the name of the Lord we are living in such a time and after the the sister beating the husband and they tell her please go back to your place he says I don't want to leave this is my place and then you hear praise the name of our Lord sister beating the husband after beating the husband he says tell me if the husband refuses another punishment either look him outside or deny him food that kind of Str these are things which used to happen the other side that the husband doing but now you hear the wife doing where is the problem so we need to know our roles in marriage praise the name of our and we need to see that our marriage works out each and every one of us husband or wife we have a role to play in making this marriage successful it's not only the husband's responsibility it's not only the wife's responsibility but you see we need to go into the word of God what does the Lord require me to do to make this marriage work out and you are responsible for your marriage you are responsible because you chose to be in that marriage so make it work out praise the name of our Lord make it work out weaknesses will be there failures will be there but when those things are there how do you handle them now that's where the challenge is praise the name of the Lord how do you handle those kind of issues now you look at Adam Adam also had a challenge in his marriage the serpent came by and then came and took Eve deceived her and defiled her what did Adam do praise the name of our Lord Abraham had challenges in his marriage there was barness and then Sarah tells him go in at with my man now when he goes in the maid when the maid conceives then she starts despising Sarah and then Sarah started real treating in a rush way until she ran away and then the angel of the Lord told her go back when she gave birth and then now she she then then is started again you know mistreating Isaac and then you know Sarah said now this is enough go away with this son of the born woman and then the Bible says it hurt Abraham Sarah said let her go with her son but who brought Abraham in that problem Sarah but then sah was blaming Abraham for that problem until God told Abraham do what Sarah has told you and then sah Abraham released them they had challenges in their mind Isaac's marriage it also had challenges they spent about 20 years without giving birth but how do they handle it Rebecca also the mate but Rebecca didn't tell the mate that you go in with my husband Isaac you remember the story of Jacob When Rachel was not giving birth she gave in her M to Jacob and then when Le saw that richel had given him the m g her they had challenges but how were they handling those challenges we also need to learn from them praise the name of our Lord how do we handle our challenges at but when they had challenges they were not fighting one another they were not killing one another they had respect for one another Abraham had respect for Sarah praise the name of our Lord Rebecca had respect for Isaac they had respect for one another and even us in our marriages we need to learn to respect one another you need to learn and know just as you have your husband just as you have your wife they also human beings they have feelings like you have feels so the Bible says that treat others the way you want to be treated praise the name of our Lord you treat your husband if you also to be one treated well treat him well you treat your wife treat her well way you want to be treated praise the name of our Lord because these are two people who have come together different feelings different backgrounds of so you need to see that you contribute your part you play your role make your marriage work out it's not one way praise the name of there are things each of you has to contribute and God has put these things specifically in the word that there's always an exchange there is always leaning upon one another there's always complimenting one another there's always you know supporting one another praise the name of our Lord and this is what we see in the scriptures when Eve fell in half sin Adam came to see how she can be delivered praise the name of our Lord and this is the same way the Lord Jesus came he came and took our sin that we can be delivered praise the name of our Lord and that should be the same thing in our marriages your love for your wife your love your love for your wife your love for your husband you know way the scripture say you should Este the other more than Yourself Praise the name of our Lord Este the other more than yourself before you eat are you concerned as she eaten before he eats are you concerned she has something to eat you know like some of the villages we have a some places even the communities we live in you find a man lives home without leaving any money then he goes in a trading center or a stage and then early in the morning is eating a lot of but has left nothing when the time to go back home comes passes by to eat and then aty doesn't want to eat there was a story this man here he only knows take away for himself and then when he brings it at home when he brings the food at for have cooked the food the money has left for them they cook food for the little money has left for them and then for him he brings take away chicken then he brings it and then he starts eating and he does it not once the wife just says please give me some that's not the marriage God wants us to have praise the name of our Lord whereby the husband only thinks about himself buying clothes buying shoes this new SC when it comes to the wife I don't have money when it comes to food changing meals money but he's able to eat food of 10,000 in town but he lives 2,000 that kind of not being concerned about one another that's not the marriage that's not the family that God would desire us to have actually as a family whatever you eat you should desire even your toake of or even better than what you eat praise the name of our Lord if it is getting something new you desire the other party to have it before you have it praise the name of that's how we should live as husband and wife that's how we should live in a family let us go in First Peter chapter 3 First Peter chapter 3 and then verse one it says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wives praise the name of he says wives you have a testimony to live and the scripture says that your behavior avior can convert people who are outside praise the name of the Lord your conduct as a sister your conduct as a wife at home God desires you to be able to do the conduct according to the word of God that's what God requires of us and as a wife at home why do you spend time in Lum Mong why do you spend time in despising others this is many times what you find in the neighborhood all the time look at her look at this one look at their children now that kind of conduct cannot bring people to Christ but now the Bible is telling us that your behavior should be able to win people and then they bring them to Christ praise the name of our Lord the same thing with us husband where you walk from when they look at you at the people Desiring to be like you or they look at you as a different thing all together praise the name of our Lord then in while they beheld your CH conversation coupled with fear whose adoring let it not be the outward adoring of plating of the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on appr now this ading is talking about is not saying don't dress outside but he's saying your dressing Insight should be more precious more than the outside dressing just as you care how you appear just as you care how you are dressed outside the scripture say you the inner man should be dressed with a spirit a me and quiet spirit praise the name of our something which is so precious before and that is the character of Jesus Christ so we need to have the character of Jesus Christ in our marriage praise the name of our Lord you have the character of Jesus Christ in all the things that you do that's the desire of God how you conduct before your husband how you conduct before your wife how you conduct before your children it should be the character of God now don't say me my my husband doesn't behave like that my wife doesn't behave like that how about you if for them they not behaving are you behaving according to the word of praise the name of because you has known God you need to behave according to the word but if you don't behave according to the word then you will be a hypocrite so you can't deliver the other person if they are wrong but if you are if they are wrong and you are doing right then God will hear your prayers to deliver the other person praise the name of our Lord you know there are some areas where if the husband is bad the wife will also change and become bad which is not right praise the name of our Lord then in verse five for after this man and the old times the holy women also who trusted in God adored themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands praise the name of our Lord he says the old women they dress themselves a mixed spirit and a quiet spirit and they were in subjection to their own husbands praise the name of Lord you know we are in the age of equal rights equal rights equal everything and until sometimes you may find the wife is more successful than the husband it's a time we are living in there is a church where you find the sisters are driving but the brothers are not driving but the sisters need sister Brothers to marry them and for women sometimes to get some of these jobs sometimes EAS for women to get jobs those who are educated more than the brothers who are educated but when you come to marriage take your position as a wife to be subjected to your husband because your subjection to your husband is your security is your protection praise the name of our Lord not because this not because that but that is your security that is your protection and that's how the word of God can come and help you when you are obeying the word of God praise the name of our Lord then in verse six even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement he says do the same thing sah said will my Lord Abraham she respected her husband and this should be the same thing is the wives respecting being in subjection to their own husband let us go to Colossians chter 3 Colossians chapter 3 and then Verse 18 He says wies submit yourselves un your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord praise the name of our Lord he says it is fit when God in Genesis chapter 3 and then verse 16 when the sin had been committed God told the woman to the woman he said I will multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall ru the husband will rule over the wife and that's why he says wife subject yourselves to your own it's for your protection when Eve was not under the leadership of Adam then the serpent came forth and God has by Nature created that a wife has to be submissive even her heart goes after her husband now if you despise your husband it is most likely that another man will take the place of your husband praise the name of if you put your husband down not that there is another Spirit which will lead you to another man you will regard better than your husband and that's fall that brings the fall and then you'll see that there is a lot of Havoc at home praise the name of our and so now when we go back to Colossians chter 3 and then verse 19 he says husbands love your wives be not bitter against so as a husband you must love your wife and the Bible say don't be bitter regardless of what she has done don't be bitter the Bible says love covers a multitude of so if there is something she has done the scripture expects you to forgive her the scripture expects you to love her praise the name of our Lord you know there's another scripture here I didn't write it down but there's a scripture which says that love covers a multitude of sins but in that same verse he says he that repeat an issue he that repe an issue separate very friends praise the name of our Lord Proverbs 7 9 Proverbs 179 it says he that cover a transgression seeketh love so your wife has done something wrong she has transgressed the Bible says don't be bitter praise the name of our Lord and then the Bible again continues to say but he that repeat a matter separate very friends what is repeating your wife has made a mistake and all the time you reminding about that mistake that's why you don't know how to wash that's why you don't know how to cook that's why you don't know how to do this that's why you don't know how to this very terrible praise the name of the Lord or your husband that's why you don't know to dress that's why your styles are not good the time do that same thing praise the name of our Lord and you not able to bear with one another so you are pushing his heart away and now when you push his heart away not that the conduct may also change with time when the conduct changes you may realize when he has gone too far and then you start wondering why doesn't he tell me this why doesn't he tell me this he used to tell me this he used to tell me this praise the name of our Lord so the Bible says love your wife don't be bitter regardless of the mistake she has praise the name of our Lord and in any case however mistake she has made she still remains your wife praise the name of our Lord learn how to bear with her learn how to live with her praise the name of our Lord let us go back to First Peter chapter 3 and then verse S likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto a wicker vessel and as being hairs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered praise the name of our so he says dwell with them according to knowledge giving H unto the wife as a weaker vessel and being ha together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so take bitterness out of your marriage take despising one out of your marriage and learn to desire each other praise the name of the Lord God wants to continually see that unit you know husband and wife as one the wife is not the other side the husband is not the other side but you are moving together praise the name of our Lord with that love for one another that confidence you have for one another praise the name of our Lord then verse eight finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be cous praise the name of the Lord husband and wife says be of one mind don't be contrary have compassion why do you need compassion because there are some things which are not right that you're doing there are some things that are not good that you doing now that's when you need compassion that's when you need to be helped that's when you need a companion somebody you can share with your weaknesses somebody you can share with your achievement praise the name of the Lord and then you can move together you can live together you can age together so you don't look at her weakness you don't look at the weakness or the failures of the wife and even the wife you not look at the weakness or the failures of the husband you can't live together by looking at each other's weakness and you know trying to push somebody because of their weakness that's not what marriage is praise the name of our Lord but you need to support one another you need to stand with one another you need to help one another when one is weak you lift the other up praise the name of the Lord so then he continues to say not rendering evil for evil or ring for ring but contrary wise blessing knowing that you are there unto that you should inherit a blessing praise the name of our we have been called to inherit a blessing so we don't render evil for evil if somebody if they husband does you wrong if the wife does you wrong you don't say I'm not going to do this for her I'm not going to do this for her I'm not going to do this for him that's not a Christian life you don't do ring for [Applause] ring you then you also get back you are like this you also like this what a home and what will the children do praise the name of the Lord but you see there are places you go to and you don't feel peace say how do you live in such a place where the peace of God is not received is not welcome praise the name of our Lord verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no gu let him evil and do good and let him seek peace and it you seeking peace then work things for peace praise the name of you don't work things for fighting I'm going to show him I'm going to show her at the end of the day you may be hurting yourself you may even be taking away the peace that you have praise the name of our Lord you know there are some families or some homes you know if you do something he say he has done this I'm going to do this to him and now when you do it you may lose him or you may lose her until you'll try to bring the person up but they can't be brought because it is a shock said he can my husband do this can my wife do this then they start thinking something else but that should not be at our homes if God has given you that husband if God has given you that wife do everything according to the word of God praise the name of the do everything the Bible says love as Brethren no it's the Lord who has United you no it's the Lord who has United it's the Lord who has put you in that home the has brought you together so see that your marriage works out and don't fight the arrangement of God praise the name of our Lord by doing things the way the world does their things you know for the world you know for them they just have fun Consultants people who don't give them the right advice and then they follow that wrong advice we shouldn't do that learn to pray for one another learn to stand and support each other in their weaknesses learn to bear with one another learn to be kind to one another that's what the Holy Spirit wants us that your marriage may be peaceful because the Bible says seek peace and they sue it and then the Bible says blessed are the peace makers be a peacemaker not somebody who brings confusion not somebody who brings separation but you are always seeking Lord come down in our home Lord come down in our family help in this kind of Str help in this kind of challenge this is how the Lord wants us to have our praise the name of our Lord that you have a marriage that is so full of peace sometimes you may not have everything you want but one thing the Lord promises us is peace why is don't you have peace at your home ah because we don't have food we don't have jobs it's not that that brings peace praise the name of our Lord but you yourself have to desire be obedient to the word of God and then the presence of God in your home will bring the peace praise the name of our Lord and the peace of God shall surely come and you need to live in a home that has peace praise the name of our Lord let us go to Psalms 34 and then verse 13 the scripture says keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from from speaking depart from Evil and do good and seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are upon their cry praise the name of the Lord he says seek peace seek peace at your home seek Joy at your home and it's you building your home you either break it or you build it praise the name of our Lord if you trouble your house the Bible says you are going to inherit winds so you don't travel your house but see that you build your house putting your house together even if they are broken pieces you can put those broken pieces together the name of our Lord there's a broken piece of this issue there's a broken piece of this issue you can bring them together and live in peace at your home praise the name of our Lord nobody will bring the peace if you don't bring it yourself as a husband or as a wife praise the name of our Lord this is something in your control praise the name of our Lord so be obedient to the word of God do the way the word of God instructs us to do praise the name of our Lord as a husband love your wife don't be bitter provide for your house because concerned about your family praise the name of our Lord encourage them stand with them be concerned about everything then as a wife you know be submissive to your husband praise the name of our Lord and be caring be concerned praise the name of the Lord let us go back to Colossians chapter 3 Colossians chapter 3 and then we read in verse 12 he says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long suffering amen amen said put on bowels ofcy kindness why would don't you want to be merciful to your own household why would don't you want to be kind to your own household why don't you have that kind of you know Gentle Spirit to your own household you know there are some people they are very rough to their families but the neighbors they try to show kindness Hypocrites why don't you express your goodness your own family but when the children come to you you are too rough when others come hey how are you good why don't you do that to your children praise the name of our Lord when they go to places of work and then they get him if she if she's a wife and then the other is a colleague how are you sir you are nice until the other man starts desing I wish this one was my wife there is a place I was washing a car from and when I sat there and then another man came to wash his car and then he was talking to another gentleman he said the other wife I had the wife I had where is she the other one knew where she is said she went and then he don't know he was sympathizing with the next man who took the wife that kind of thing praise the name it should not be like that see that you have kindness and goodness at your home praise the name of the Lord so you see people want to express being good to the people away but in reality at home they are not that's not being a Christian praise the name of our Lord like they say charity starts at home prove it to your family to your husband to your wife to your children praise the name of our Lord be good to your own household if you're not good to your own household you are going to inherit wind your house will be scattered and there will be nothing found after you nothing will be found and now in times of distress you may find you fail to get somebody to come and help you praise the name of Lord so the Bible says show bowels of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long suffering forbearing one another forgiving one another any man have a qu against any even as Christ forgive you so you also do at home exercise these things praise the name of the Lord exercise them at home to your wife to your husband to your children praise the name of our then the scripture continues to say and above all put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God lure in your hearts to which you are also called in one body and be ye thankful praise the name of let the peace of God L us let the love of God be in our hearts love towards one another say that the home has stability praise the name of the home has the presence of God in it not all the time complaining when this one is annoyed slaps BS the door no that should not be at home praise the name of the Lord and you even the Bible tells us if you are going to be angry don't allow the son to goes over your praise the name of our Lord but let the love of God Lear to bear with one another learn to be kind to one another learn to pray with one another and learn to stand with one another that's what God requires of us as God has given you that husband as God has given you that wife treat him as a child of God with love with care with respect praise the name of our and you don't only look at your own side but also are there others feeling praise the name of our Lord another person is feeling another person is concerned praise the name of our Lord like listening to one another you know these days we have a problem with phones maybe you are reading and then starts talking how there some you want to complete then but you have not had me then you start trouble starts from there but even listening is not only putting your ears there but there are those who want you to finish then they speak back but they have not had they have not they have not taken what you are talking about arguing this understand the other understand this one the other understand what a home praise the name of the Lord but should not be like that in our homes we need to handle with one another respect be concerned about the others feelings praise the name of our Lord respecting each other's IDE and then you see how can we move forward from here praise the name of so we need to see that our homes are stable we need to see that the presence of God always in our home and we see that Satan does not come in any way to separate us as husband and wife or to separate us from raising children in the right way because as a husband and wife you may be well doing well but how about your children how are you relating with your children how are you raising your children praise the name of our Lord God is concerned in all these things so in every challenge we face at home learn to call upon the name of the Lord the Lord come down in this station if your husband doesn't understand you pray for him bear with him if your wife doesn't understand you pray for her bear with her and continue with that kind of love and desire for one another praise the name of our as you live together you are happy to be moving together you know you are not seeking how you can be away from him or how you can be away from your wife but the time you spend together in Fellowship praise the like I was reading about Isaac when Abraham saw that his wife had died then Abraham made sure that he gets a wife for Isaac and then the Bible says when Isaac married Rebecca praise the name of our Lord when Isaac married Rebecca I think let us finish with that scripture Genesis chapter 24 Genesis 24 and then we read in verse 67 Genesis 67 and Isaac brought her into his mother his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death 67a the name so Rebecca brought such comfort she brought such a joy to Isaac and this is what should be in our homes your wife is such a comfort to you she's such a joy she is such a blessing even the same thing as a wife your husband is such so precious to you and this is what our families should have praise the name of our not again a terrible place again a place you avoid coming to or coming to interact with your wife or coming to interact with your husband but you desire one another you love to spend time together praise the name you love to hear one another what is she saying what is your concern like kingas he desired to hear what Esther was saying Queen Esther what is your desire what is your petition oh I want you to come to the banquet and now you can imagine how short notice it was but the king had to put other official duties the king had to put other delates conferences and everything aside and say I'm going to spend time with the queen I'm going to spend time with the queen so it should be such a precious time we spend together as husband and wife praise the name of our Lord time to commune time to Fellowship sitting together and then feeding praise the name of our sharing conversing should be such a good time you know the Bible says in Mar chapter 2 God said I was a witness when was a witness when you are trying to get at that time when you were mared praise the name of our Lord you know like when when you are you are trying to C you feel the time you have been together is not enough then you start thinking now she's going back now I'm also going back now you look for the day you'll start living together you'll even put other programs aside you'll even forget other people's things even your parents whatever they will say you don't want to hear but if he says Ah it's exciting or if she says it it's exciting how about now that's what the Lord says I was a witness and God desires the same kind of feeling you had to continue with the same kind of feeling towards your husband towards your wife praise the name of our Lord where you desire one another where the wife is so feels she's so valued before you and the husband also feels is also valued before the wife but not start looking at him down casting Your Eyes Upon them no praise the name of we need to have that love for one another the desire for one another the longing for one another that we can live Always In Harmony praise the name of our Lord that's the desire for the husband God has given you that's the desire for the wife God has given you that you may still have that love that desire living together doing things together sharing praise the name of our Lord and not denying one another or seeing that okay this is what he likes today I'm not going to do oh this is what I'm not going this but esing the others needs above your needs that's the desire of God for us praise the name of our Lord may God bless you
