[24:08] word that's where we can find joy and
[24:11] peace commit service into your
[24:14] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:18] Christ amen let us go to Luke chapter
[24:23] 15 and then we're reading from verse 8
[24:26] to verse 10
[24:30] Luke
[24:32] 15 verse 8 verse
[24:36] 10 so the Bible
[24:39] says either what woman having 10 pieces
[24:42] of silver if she lose one piece does not
[24:46] light a candle and strip the house and
[24:49] seek diligently till she find
[24:57] it
[25:09] and when she has found it she calleth
[25:12] her friends and her neighbors together
[25:15] saying Rejoice with me for I have found
[25:18] the peace which I had
[25:27] lost
[25:35] likewise say unto you there is joy in
[25:38] the presence of the angels of God over
[25:41] one sinner that
[25:52] repentance may God bless of his word you
[25:55] may be
[25:56] seated praise the name of our Lord
[25:59] I want to preach on the
[26:01] subject seeking that which is lost in
[26:04] your
[26:07] marriage seeking that which is lost in
[26:10] your
[26:12] marriage now this Parable we have
[26:15] read talks about a
[26:18] woman who had 10 pieces of
[26:22] silver now now these 10 pieces of
[26:26] silver in the customs of the Jews or the
[26:30] way the Jews were
[26:33] living they were put in a
[26:36] tablet you know something like they put
[26:39] around on top of the
[26:41] head and that tablet had 10 pieces of
[26:51] silver and
[26:53] now each of those 10
[26:57] pieces
[26:58] represented a certain virt for that
[27:05] woman and so now this woman lost one
[27:09] piece of
[27:12] Silver And now when she lost
[27:15] it that implied that there is a virtue
[27:19] that she had
[27:24] lost maybe it would reflect that there's
[27:27] something but in her
[27:30] marriage so now she had
[27:34] nine she has lost
[27:36] one but she
[27:40] diligently
[27:41] s that lost
[27:45] silver praise the name of our Lord now
[27:49] in the message the second coming of the
[27:52] Lord then he
[27:55] says we find this woman
[27:59] her husband had
[28:01] gone and she had lost one of the coins
[28:05] out of her
[28:09] tablet now I will try to explain
[28:13] that today if a woman is
[28:17] married she should wear a wedding ring
[28:19] as a sign that she's
[28:23] married that is to keep other man from
[28:25] having anything to do with her
[28:32] they look and they see she's a married
[28:35] woman in those days they didn't have
[28:38] wedding
[28:40] rings they had a
[28:45] tablet and you know they call it a
[28:48] tablet they put it on their
[28:51] head and it had 10
[28:54] coins and it went around their head
[28:59] and that was a sign that they were a
[29:01] married
[29:04] woman and no man was to fool with
[29:08] them no boy was to fle with
[29:13] them they were
[29:15] married each one of those
[29:18] coins if we have only
[29:25] time but I haven't I'm going to try to
[29:28] my okay said I could tell you what each
[29:30] of those coins
[29:33] meant it was placed in
[29:36] there and each coin meant a certain
[29:40] virtue of that
[29:44] woman the first meaning of her love to
[29:47] the
[29:51] husband the second pledge to to over to
[29:55] live clean for him uh
[30:03] and the third and fourth andth nth and
[30:07] 10th praise the name of our Lord so now
[30:10] we see that this woman had lost one
[30:14] coin and you know that when we
[30:19] marry you find that you start as a happy
[30:25] couple you know everything seems to be
[30:28] doing
[30:29] well and you know
[30:32] until I remember there's a wedding
[30:34] meeting we had
[30:36] here I think I don't know how many years
[30:38] ago but I think it's before
[30:41] Corona and we're just in the Sunday
[30:44] school and then the
[30:48] brother said if anybody talks about
[30:52] her because the meeting was about to we
[30:56] that brother and the sister
[31:00] said I don't want to hear anything
[31:02] against
[31:04] her they were not yet waed but you see
[31:07] that kind of feeling for one
[31:11] another you know they're not yet married
[31:14] but one wouldn't want to hear anything
[31:16] against the
[31:19] other and even sometimes when people are
[31:21] in that kind of
[31:24] love you'll find that even if something
[31:28] is true about the
[31:31] person the other one's eyes are not
[31:33] seeing
[31:35] it I don't mind
[31:37] about whatever you say She's mine he is
[31:43] mine but now as time goes
[31:47] on they lose the
[31:52] coin now where does the coin
[31:55] go so we need to see that we seek that
[31:58] lost
[32:01] coin that first love that we had for one
[32:05] another that respect that we had for one
[32:09] another that feeling that we had for one
[32:13] another praise the name of our Lord you
[32:16] know like adult
[32:17] people you've never lived
[32:20] together but then you have
[32:23] confidence that you can live with this
[32:26] man you can live with this
[32:28] woman so
[32:32] close praise the name of the Lord so we
[32:35] need to Li sick for that lost
[32:38] coin praise the name of our Lord the
[32:41] Lost coins in our
[32:43] marriage maybe love has departed from
[32:46] our
[32:47] home submission has departed from our
[32:50] home peace has departed from our
[32:52] home Joy has gone from our home there is
[32:56] no more compassion
[32:59] there's no more fear of
[33:00] God there's no more
[33:03] Comfort whatever we have lost in our
[33:07] marriage we need to seek it praise the
[33:11] name of our Lord now we have a
[33:14] promise in Luke
[33:17] 11 and then verse
[33:20] 9 the Bible says and I say unto you ask
[33:26] and it will be given you seek and you
[33:29] shall find knock and it shall be opened
[33:33] unto
[33:42] you for everyone that ask
[33:47] receiveth and he that seeketh
[33:51] findeth unto him that knth it shall be
[33:55] open that's what the Bible say
[33:59] so now if you have lost
[34:02] anything seek for it pursue it seek it
[34:08] diligently praise the name of our like
[34:11] here is an interesting
[34:14] scenario to convince a woman to leave
[34:17] her parents
[34:21] home you you don't just wake up one
[34:23] morning and say tomorrow she's just
[34:26] coming
[34:28] it takes time to convince
[34:30] her and then she said ah this is the
[34:33] best person maybe the friend would ask
[34:35] are you sure that man is going
[34:37] to are you sure this is will happen and
[34:41] she is convinced Beyond
[34:43] doubt and then she comes to your
[34:48] place now you s
[34:50] her and then you able to convince
[34:54] her and then now you find that in some
[34:56] marriages
[34:59] things are upside
[35:02] down things are completely
[35:07] scattered there's no more joy there's no
[35:10] more peace why don't you do the same to
[35:14] bring that peace back which
[35:17] has praise the name of our Lord why
[35:20] don't you humble
[35:21] yourself that you know you can get back
[35:24] to that
[35:25] time the love that you had for one
[35:28] another the respect that you had for one
[35:30] another and so that's what this woman
[35:33] was doing she was seeking for that lost
[35:37] coin and so we also need to seek what we
[35:40] have lost in our
[35:43] marriage the love you had for your wife
[35:46] if is not
[35:48] there ignite it to come back praise the
[35:51] name of our Lord let it come back at
[35:54] least there are so many
[35:56] things know about yourself that can put
[36:00] you together the what can divide you
[36:04] praise the name of our Lord there are so
[36:06] many
[36:07] things that can draw you at time you
[36:10] didn't know
[36:12] much when you are just married but yet
[36:15] you had a lot of love you had a lot of
[36:18] feeling you had a lot of desire for one
[36:21] another and now that time has gone many
[36:25] things have
[36:26] happened the things you have done
[36:28] together let those things You' have been
[36:32] together and then the things you take
[36:34] interest
[36:40] in you
[36:42] together not what you don't
[36:45] agree but the things that you agree
[36:49] on praise the name of our you know it is
[36:52] very
[36:53] interesting there are some
[36:56] families where the husband does not talk
[36:59] with the
[37:01] wife if if the the husband wants
[37:06] anything uses the
[37:08] children if the wife wants
[37:10] anything uses the children now about
[37:14] when the child is
[37:18] Si is both your
[37:21] child what are you going to
[37:24] do and then there are those where they
[37:26] can't talk at
[37:28] all and when the child becomes sick
[37:32] that's when they try to feed it to come
[37:34] back should not be like
[37:37] that we shouldn't allow
[37:42] crisis to bring us together praise the
[37:46] name of our Lord how many crises are you
[37:48] going to have at to come
[37:51] together we shouldn't allow
[37:53] crisis to bring us together but let it
[37:57] be love of
[37:58] God that
[38:00] concern that feeling for one
[38:03] another praise the name of our Lord that
[38:06] we can get back together and live as a
[38:10] family so the Bible has told us seek and
[38:15] you shall find like this woman when she
[38:18] lost the
[38:19] coin the Bible says she swept
[38:23] around she kept checking every corner
[38:28] she didn't take anything for
[38:31] granted you know because when you are
[38:33] looking for something which is
[38:35] lost you don't know what where it has
[38:38] gone so she started turning things
[38:40] upside down she started checking
[38:44] here that should be the same thing we
[38:46] need to do praise the name of our Lord
[38:49] that we may seek that which is lost in
[38:52] our
[38:53] marriage and we restore it its position
[38:58] now still in that message the second
[38:59] coming of the
[39:01] Lord he says in paragraph
[39:05] 71 now she had a house cleaning
[39:09] time she scrubbed the
[39:12] floors she swept the
[39:15] walls she took down the
[39:18] cobwebs she kept on until she found what
[39:22] she had
[39:25] lost and when she did she called her
[39:28] little sister churches to come
[39:32] now praise the name of the Lord that
[39:35] should be also the same thing seek that
[39:38] which you have lost in
[39:39] your and see that you restore it see
[39:43] that you bring it back see that you put
[39:46] it in its

[40:43] wish I had got the other

[41:29] Believer oh I wish he was a
[41:32] Believer that's the best person the Lord
[41:34] has given
[41:35] you and then you cherish
[41:38] them praise the name of the Lord you
[41:40] cherish them because at that time that's
[41:44] the decision you

[41:49] marriage is until
[41:51] death so you're not going to say let me
[41:54] pray for this one to die to get

[42:23] have you learn to bear with one another
[42:26] in their
[42:29] difference praise the name of Lord even
[42:32] if he goes to another church or he goes
[42:35] to another
[42:36] religion still is the best husband or
[42:39] the best
[42:40] wife and you keep on cherishing them and
[42:44] as you live the life of Christ you may
[42:47] be able to win that person to
[42:49] Christ praise the name of our Lord and
[42:52] that's how the Lord wants us to
[42:54] do you know marriage is Honorable in
[43:04] if you married
[43:08] whenever God
[43:11] hon if you
[43:14] mared and you is your husband or your
[43:19] wife
[43:20] that so you learn to bear with
[43:24] that praise the name of our Lord
[43:27] marriage is Honorable in
[43:31] all so if you have made that
[43:34] decision be able to stand with
[43:37] it not again saying I made a mistake the
[43:40] other time now I can
[43:44] change praise the name of our Lord
[43:46] marriage is Honorable in
[43:49] all praise the name of our Lord you know
[43:52] there was a Catholic
[43:56] priest in the
[43:59] US and then he
[44:01] married and then people are
[44:04] criticizing why did he marry when he to
[44:07] Mar then brother told them marriage is
[44:11] Honorable in
[44:13] all as long as he not in
[44:16] adulter God Honors
[44:19] that praise the name of our so then we
[44:22] need to see that we seek
[44:25] that which is lost in our
[44:28] marriage let us go to Ephesians 5:
[44:35] 21 Ephesians
[44:46] 521 the scripture
[44:50] says submitting yourselves one to
[44:53] another in the fear of God
[44:59] praise the name of our Lord
[45:03] submitting giving an ear to one
[45:06] another communicating with one
[45:10] another praise the name of our in the
[45:13] fear of
[45:16] God not an issue whereby you can't even
[45:20] talk with one
[45:23] another you can't hear one another you
[45:26] can't give truth to the other what they
[45:28] saying the Bible says submitting
[45:31] yourselves to one
[45:33] another in the fear of God wife submit
[45:38] yourselves and your own
[45:41] husbands as unto the
[45:45] Lord praise the name of our Lord because
[45:48] as a
[45:49] husband the Bible says is the head of
[45:52] the
[45:54] wife even as Christ is the head of of
[45:57] the
[45:58] church is the savior of the
[46:01] body therefore as the church is subject
[46:05] un
[46:07] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[46:13] husbands in
[46:15] everything now as a wife be submissive
[46:18] to your
[46:19] husband that's why the Bible says unto
[46:23] the Lord as unto your lord like Sarah
[46:28] she was calling Abraham my
[46:31] Lord Abraham was her
[46:34] head and now we are living in times of
[46:41] emancipation but you see the Bible says
[46:44] wife submit yourselves to your
[46:47] husband that's your position and your
[46:51] submission is your
[46:54] security praise the name of our Lord
[46:57] your submission is your
[46:59] security you know a home cannot have two
[47:04] heads because Which side will it
[47:08] take praise the name of our Lord there
[47:10] has to be one head so as a wife learn to
[47:14] be submissive to your
[47:17] husband even the things you don't agree
[47:20] with see how you can politely express
[47:24] yourself not me I will not do that
[47:29] praise the name of the Lord but be how
[47:31] you can be humble and
[47:34] me and sometimes you know if you are
[47:37] told something you think may not
[47:40] work be humble
[47:43] enough the other part is not
[47:46] agreeing let us do
[47:48] it praise the name of the Lord you know
[47:51] there are different ways of doing
[47:52] different
[47:55] things praise the name of
[47:57] and not getting stuck in your
[48:01] corner
[48:04] this it can't work out like that praise
[48:07] the name of our Lord so as a wife have
[48:11] that virtue of
[48:14] submission if that kind of submission is
[48:19] lost seek
[48:23] it praise the name of the because your
[48:28] it's your protection and this how the
[48:30] Lord has ordained it
[48:32] to praise the name of our then in verse
[48:36] 25 husbands love your
[48:41] wives even as Christ also loved the
[48:46] church and gave himself for
[48:50] it that's what the Bible saying if you
[48:53] are a
[48:55] husband love your wife
[48:58] praise the name of our Lord do
[49:01] everything you
[49:02] can expressing your love to
[49:07] your praise the name of the Lord not
[49:10] again taking kind of you know sful
[49:15] decisions you know hurting one
[49:18] another repeating an issue the other day
[49:21] you did this this day you did this that
[49:25] should not be the thing at home
[49:27] but let because the Bible says love
[49:30] covers a multitude of
[49:33] sins love covers a multitude of
[49:36] weaknesses so if you love somebody
[49:40] you're not going to look at their
[49:42] weaknesses you're not going to stand
[49:44] strength on their
[49:46] weaknesses you're not going to
[49:47] continously choose the day you did this
[49:51] now yesterday you did this now again you
[49:54] being
[49:55] rebellious no
[49:57] praise the name of our Lord love the
[50:00] Bible says husbands love your
[50:05] wives you know these are the
[50:07] beginnings and we need to go back to the
[50:10] beginning of our
[50:12] marriage that
[50:14] love that
[50:16] care that
[50:18] concern praise the name of our Lord so
[50:21] he says husbands love your
[50:24] wives wives submit to your
[50:29] husband praise the name of our Lord and
[50:31] that's how God wants us to see that we
[50:34] operate our
[50:37] marriages your marriage being
[50:40] operated based on the love of
[50:43] God praise the name of our Lord not on
[50:46] what we read maybe on
[50:52] infection you know novels or
[50:55] fings different things where we get
[50:58] influences
[51:00] from but the word of God has been
[51:04] proved praise the name of our Lord and
[51:07] that's why our protection
[51:08] is praise the name of our Lord let us go
[51:11] to First pter
[51:16] 3 first chter 3 and then verse
[51:21] 4 the Bible says but let it be the
[51:25] hidden man of of the heart in that which
[51:28] is not corruptible even the ornament of
[51:31] a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the
[51:34] sight of God of great
[51:51] price now the Bible is
[51:54] saying the adorning of the
[52:02] wives you know it should be a Meek and
[52:06] quiet
[52:10] Spirit which is in the sight of God
[52:13] great
[52:16] price praise the name of our Lord that
[52:18] sweet
[52:20] spirit let let the sweet spirit of God
[52:22] be around
[52:25] you you know you know Adon with that
[52:28] grace of
[52:30] God praise the name of our you know Adon
[52:33] with that kind of fear of
[52:37] God praise the name of the Lord you know
[52:41] not like you know I I remember when I
[52:44] was in
[52:46] too there was a certain
[52:50] politician and she was representing a
[52:53] certain
[52:55] Village
[52:57] and the other one was
[53:00] known when she starts
[53:04] talking
[53:06] ah she had a husband who was a medical
[53:14] doctor but that home you would wonder
[53:18] how it was
[53:19] running
[53:23] anything she didn't have respect of any
[53:25] Authority
[53:28] no wonder sometime
[53:31] later the husband also slapped
[53:35] somebody so it was such a
[53:39] family but so you would wonder why is
[53:42] that me and quiet
[53:46] Spirit the fear of God the respect for
[53:51] another but then you see that the home
[53:54] is totally out of order
[53:59] praise the name of our Lord that should
[54:01] not be our homes we shouldn't take those
[54:04] kind of
[54:05] spirits you know where you hold
[54:09] Grudge you know something against
[54:12] somebody and you cannot let it
[54:15] go praise the name of the Lord but there
[54:18] should be a me and quiet
[54:21] Spirit which is of great which is a
[54:24] great price in the sight of God
[54:28] and then the Bible says after this
[54:31] manner in the old time the holy women
[54:33] also who trusted in God adored
[54:36] themselves being in subjection unto
[54:38] their own
[54:53] husbands praise the name of the Lord be
[54:56] reflected in our
[54:58] heart wives being in subjection unto
[55:01] their own
[55:03] husbands even as Sarah obeyed
[55:09] Abraham calling him
[55:12] Lord whose daughters you
[55:16] are as long as you do
[55:20] well and are not afraid with any
[55:25] amazement
[55:27] praise the name of our Lord you know you
[55:29] are looking at how holy women in the
[55:31] Bible
[55:34] behaved this is what the Bible wants us
[55:36] to take
[55:38] also so if you have lost a
[55:42] coin of
[55:45] subjection you need to seek that and
[55:47] restore it in its
[55:49] position praise the name of our Lord
[55:52] then verse seven likewise ye
[55:55] husbands with them according to
[56:00] knowledge giving honor unto the
[56:03] wife as unto the weaker
[56:06] vessel and as being ha together of the
[56:09] grace of
[56:14] life that your prayers be not
[56:18] hindered praise the name of our Lord he
[56:21] says give
[56:22] honor give respect don't brush their
[56:28] ideas don't brush off what they doing
[56:30] and
[56:32] ignore Dem them or lower them or step
[56:38] upon them you don't do that but then you
[56:41] have respect one for
[56:43] another praise the name of our Lord this
[56:46] is what the Lord wants in our
[56:48] families God wants peace in our
[56:51] homes God wants respect in our homes God
[56:55] wants love in our homes God wants
[56:58] submission in our
[56:59] homes so what is that which is lost in
[57:02] your home and then you seek and see that
[57:05] it is
[57:06] found SE that it is
[57:09] restored praise the name of our Lord but
[57:12] why would your marriage be a hard
[57:17] journey every day is difficult coming
[57:21] home is
[57:22] hard praise the name of the Lord you
[57:25] know there are people who find Joy with
[57:26] their colleagues at place of
[57:29] work but when they come home
[57:33] grooming that should not be that it
[57:36] should be that you find Joy at
[57:38] home you find Comfort at home the travs
[57:42] you had at a place of work when you come
[57:45] home you are able to
[57:47] share and then you pray together and
[57:50] then you encourage one another so when
[57:53] you raise up in the morning you are
[57:55] stronger than when you came last night
[57:58] but again when you come home the night
[58:01] may be too
[58:04] long start
[58:06] wondering or you can keep yourself
[58:09] busy praise the name of the Lord you
[58:12] know there are some
[58:14] families where everything it's so silent
[58:17] as if there are no people at
[58:21] home when the husband comes home he
[58:24] keeps himself busy with
[58:29] newspapers even when they go to eat he
[58:32] doesn't talk or he doesn't they don't
[58:35] don't eat
[58:37] together I put food on the
[58:39] table
[58:42] okay such kind of
[58:45] homes or maybe when there is sports like
[58:48] maybe
[58:49] football that's when the man can look
[58:51] himself and
[58:54] shout and then the wife is busy there
[58:58] maybe bothered with the children the
[59:00] other one is the other
[59:02] side or maybe the wife she comes home
[59:06] with assignments you know I'm busy doing
[59:09] this class work doing this
[59:12] assignment
[59:15] program when it comes going to time for
[59:17] going to
[59:18] bed when the other one is in bed the
[59:21] other is
[59:23] busy and then some of them
[59:27] they make timbles sure that when this
[59:30] one is at home the other is at a place
[59:32] of
[59:34] work when the other one comes home the
[59:37] other one goes out
[59:41] deliberately what a
[59:43] home until you get the whole week they
[59:46] either meeting
[59:48] once or only maybe picking the children
[59:51] from
[59:52] school and their strangers want
[59:55] to
[59:56] that's not the home that the Lord wants
[59:58] us
[59:59] to praise the name of our Lord but we
[1:00:02] need to see that how we can relate with
[1:00:04] one
[1:00:06] another and then the Bible says in verse
[1:00:09] 8 finally be all of One
[1:00:18] mind having
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:21] compassion one of
[1:00:24] another
[1:00:27] praise the name of our having
[1:00:30] compassion in other words you take the
[1:00:33] other one's burden to be your
[1:00:36] burden you are considerate
[1:00:39] enough you are concerned about the fear
[1:00:42] of your
[1:00:43] husand are concerned about the fear of
[1:00:46] your
[1:00:47] wife and when somebody says please this
[1:00:49] is my condition you take concern as if
[1:00:53] it is
[1:00:54] yourself not exploiting the other or
[1:00:58] pushing the other against yourself but
[1:01:01] being concerned about one
[1:01:03] another and then the Bible says love as
[1:01:24] brethren
[1:01:54] e
[1:02:19] every day at least they get time to say
[1:02:23] that they talk with one
[1:02:24] another and sometimes they talk when
[1:02:27] it's night when there's no
[1:02:32] interference the Sleep goes away because
[1:02:35] I'm expecting the call
[1:02:38] from how about now that you're
[1:02:42] together ah she does this and this she

[1:03:30] person and that will be the girlfriend

[1:05:07] celebrated and even the husband should
[1:05:09] celebrate the
[1:05:11] wife even the wife should celebrate the
[1:05:14] husband but now if the husband has got
[1:05:17] an
[1:05:18] achievement and he's so happy of what he
[1:05:21] has and the wife
[1:05:24] says Ah that's not his
[1:05:28] strength what a
[1:05:30] home if maybe the wife has readed
[1:05:33] hard she's going to be you know she's
[1:05:35] going to be
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:38] crowned she wasted my
[1:05:42] money what a home but then you need to
[1:05:46] see that you celebrate one
[1:05:49] another praise the name of our Lord
[1:05:51] rejoicing together being compassionate
[1:05:55] about one
[1:05:57] oh God has given my wife this I want to
[1:06:00] Rejoice with her God has given my
[1:06:02] husband this I
[1:06:04] want that's the home we should have
[1:06:07] whereby you are having that feeling for
[1:06:09] one
[1:06:10] another her success is your
[1:06:13] success the husband success is your
[1:06:16] success you know you are now
[1:06:19] happy praise the name of our Lord but
[1:06:22] you see in the
[1:06:23] Villages and those people don't are God
[1:06:27] when the man gets more
[1:06:30] money more
[1:06:34] wives but that should not be
[1:06:36] so praise the name of our Lord that
[1:06:39] should not be so or if the wife works on
[1:06:42] herself so
[1:06:45] well men are going to
[1:06:48] dist it should not be like that praise
[1:06:52] the name of our Lord we need to have
[1:06:54] that kind of love for one
[1:06:56] another that kind of feeling for one
[1:06:58] another something that can put us
[1:07:01] together praise the name of our Lord so
[1:07:04] the Bible is telling us let us have
[1:07:07] compassion one for
[1:07:10] another praise the name of our Lord let
[1:07:13] us continue to verse
[1:07:16] n not rendering evil for
[1:07:19] evil oring
[1:07:22] foring but contr wise blessing
[1:07:32] knowing that you are there
[1:07:35] un that you may inherit a
[1:07:40] blessing praise the name of the Lord if
[1:07:43] your wife does you wrong or your husband
[1:07:46] does you wrong you don't pay back but
[1:07:49] you have that
[1:07:51] compassion praise the name of our Lord
[1:07:54] and then you bless
[1:07:56] as we T in the
[1:07:57] morning praise the name of our Lord you
[1:08:00] bless one another you wish the
[1:08:03] other have good will for your
[1:08:07] husband have good will for your
[1:08:10] wife PR the name of our Lord if there's
[1:08:13] something they
[1:08:14] starting or struggling to do something
[1:08:18] stand behind them to
[1:08:19] help have that good
[1:08:22] will be a support to one another
[1:08:25] encourage one another but again not you
[1:08:28] to fail them or to defeat them or to
[1:08:32] frustrate them praise the name of our
[1:08:35] Lord and then the Bible says for he that
[1:08:38] will love life and see good
[1:08:54] days let him refrain his tongue from
[1:08:57] evil and his lips that they speak no
[1:09:07] gu let him rescue evil and do good let
[1:09:10] him seek peace
[1:09:21] and praise the name of our Lord he said
[1:09:24] seek that which is good
[1:09:27] and when you get it let it come out of
[1:09:30] you produce it
[1:09:33] pra brother wasting to pieces of
[1:09:40] silver to the fruit of the
[1:09:44] spirit in Galatians 5 and verse
[1:09:53] 22 and then this scripture
[1:10:03] says but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:10:09] love
[1:10:11] joy peace
[1:10:14] longsuffering
[1:10:16] gentleness
[1:10:18] goodness
[1:10:20] Faith
[1:10:22] meekness
[1:10:23] Temperance against such there is no
[1:10:27] law praise the name of our Lord so we
[1:10:30] need that we have the fruit of the

[1:11:03] and give you the right way of handling
[1:11:06] such an
[1:11:08] issue how to handle such a situation
[1:11:11] that you're going
[1:11:12] through praise the name of our Lord so
[1:11:15] we need say that we have the spirit of
[1:11:17] Christ we say that we bear the fruit of
[1:11:20] the
[1:11:21] spirit and let that fruit be manifested
[1:11:24] in our
[1:11:26] praise the name of our Lord you can't
[1:11:28] hide the
[1:11:29] fruit but let it be

[1:11:59] is
[1:12:00] lost praise the name of our Lord now as
[1:12:03] I finish let us go to proverbs
[1:12:09] 31 praise and name of our Lord proverbs
