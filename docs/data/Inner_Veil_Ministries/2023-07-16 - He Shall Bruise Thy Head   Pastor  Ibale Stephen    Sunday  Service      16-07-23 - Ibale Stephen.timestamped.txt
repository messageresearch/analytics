[17:50] Amen to know who we are
[17:53] and to know what you are raised up for
[17:56] now
[17:58] to know why we came in this season
[18:02] and I would relate with God
[18:06] amen amen it's very important
[18:10] so I bring greetings from Tanzania into
[18:14] soccer
[18:18] we had very very very wonderful meetings
[18:21] there
[18:24] with the brother Andrew from Germany
[18:27] when we left we went growth
[18:35] 900 kilometers
[18:38] but we reached safe and well
[18:42] amen Amina
[18:46] and we had a good three days of services
[18:51] amen amen so
[18:54] um
[18:56] I want to encourage the church
[19:00] that for you to be fully immersed in
[19:04] this message
[19:13] spend your time and study
[19:16] whatever we say here
[19:18] is from the message
[19:21] and as long as you are not studying the
[19:25] message
[19:26] it will be very hard for you to grow
[19:31] by just listening to the preacher okay
[19:36] amen amen because the preacher goes all
[19:39] over the place
[19:41] amen and if you have got no idea
[19:45] then you get it not a big problem to
[19:49] follow up
[19:51] [Music]
[19:52] I remember when we believed this message
[19:55] you
[20:01] we are digging through the messages
[20:04] especially when we were still young
[20:07] people
[20:08] I'm talking about 45 years ago
[20:13] amen we didn't have books as much as you
[20:16] have them now
[20:18] but you would hear of your brother
[20:21] about 200 kilometers away a kilometers
[20:25] who was a particular message you are
[20:28] looking for
[20:29] you and then you would go all the way to
[20:33] that place
[20:34] you sit down for two days
[20:37] you read that book you make your notes
[20:41] you come back amen amen but now we've
[20:45] got everything we have we needed
[20:48] amen Amina you see you just get in the
[20:51] back as you get out of the church
[20:55] amen Amina you pick just one book
[20:59] and then the following week you pick
[21:01] another day
[21:03] amen make sure that you read the message
[21:06] a week
[21:08] that will help you to grow
[21:11] amen are you happy
[21:13] amen Amina let's stand up and get into
[21:16] the teaching of the word this morning
[21:20] amen Genesis
[21:27] amen so before we read the words
[21:36] we thank you for you've given us this
[21:39] opportunity
[21:41] to come to the house of God
[21:44] in here we come under the anointing of
[21:47] the Holy Ghost
[21:49] to be taught of god father I pray that
[21:54] you may take the word this stores
[22:15] [Music]
[22:40] [Music]
[22:55] [Music]
[23:12] so we go to the Book of Genesis chapter
[23:15] 3.
[23:16] and I want you to settle down
[23:20] amen see what's the word is being told
[23:26] learn to sit in the presence of the holy
[23:29] spirit
[23:31] amen amen don't just walk out back and
[23:35] forth
[23:37] just sit yourself
[23:40] under the teaching of the Holy Spirit
[23:43] and as the spirit speaks to the church
[23:47] you are saying God
[23:49] help me amen I mean as we teach be in
[23:54] prayer
[23:55] God have mercy
[23:58] amen Genesis chapter 3
[24:01] verse 15.
[24:03] this is after the Fallen
[24:07] amen Adam and Eve have eaten of the
[24:10] fruit
[24:12] amen amen so God comes down and the
[24:16] first thing he does is
[24:18] to Usher out a promise
[24:22] of redemption to come by the same woman
[24:26] who had fallen
[24:28] amen amen that's how God is good
[24:32] amen he looks at the fall and he says
[24:36] out of this I can bring something go
[24:39] down
[24:40] amen amen and I'll put enemy between
[24:44] thee and the woman
[24:48] he was addressing the serpents
[24:52] and between thy seeds never
[24:58] [Music]
[24:59] the head
[25:01] [Music]
[25:15] which ultimately became the Lord Jesus
[25:19] Christ
[25:42] you know the Holy Spirit was dealing
[25:46] with me on this area
[25:49] so it's one of the subjects that I took
[25:53] called
[25:55] when I was in Tanzania Tanzania and uh
[26:00] you know I had
[26:25] so I'll take foreign
[26:54] [Music]
[27:17] and so every one of us
[27:50] your life becomes a rebuke
[27:54] your life becomes a correction
[27:57] and sometimes your word may become a
[28:00] prophetic Ataris
[28:08] might be a rebuke somebody
[28:11] The Way You Walk might to be a rebuke to
[28:13] any corruption
[28:17] and sometimes your life
[28:20] becomes prophetic before it speaks to
[28:24] some people
[28:25] and God could do this
[28:28] for so and so God will do this for me
[28:34] your life becomes a prophecy in some
[28:37] ways
[28:39] we all have teaching experiences
[28:45] towards to one another
[28:47] because we have followed one another's
[28:49] lives here
[28:52] and then we see how they've come
[28:55] Progressive
[29:03] that life becomes a certain form of
[29:06] teaching
[29:08] maybe those Brothers
[29:12] but they come to a point
[29:15] and they gain stability
[29:18] they are like a plane
[29:20] which is taking off in the sky foreign
[30:22] foreign
[30:34] perfect strength by Perfect week
[30:41] amen which is the needs of a paradox
[30:46] because how can perfect strength be in
[30:51] perfect weekend
[30:54] so if we have weaknesses
[31:09] to take a text of weakness
[31:13] because we are always testifying we are
[31:17] strong
[31:19] [Music]
[31:21] you know because that's the way of
[31:24] Pentecost
[31:25] I'm increased with Goods we are strong
[31:28] we are more than Overcomers
[31:31] and he says now here I come with a
[31:34] subject
[31:36] and Minister people who always speaking
[31:39] about strengths
[31:41] I'm going to speak on weakness
[31:49] so you know and the scripture says
[31:53] you know we need everybody you know to
[31:58] stand and recognize who we are Twitter
[32:03] and your strength
[32:06] only measures in your weakness
[32:10] so what is perfect strength
[32:15] as opposed to perfect weakness
[32:19] what does that
[32:23] [Applause]
[32:25] come on
[32:28] if you got a big brother
[32:31] and somebody is intimidating you
[32:36] your strength is in the big brother
[32:41] so that's your perfect strength
[32:44] in your perfect weekend
[32:49] so Paul says
[32:56] so the scripture in itself
[32:59] teaches themselves abide in me
[33:04] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[33:07] itself
[33:19] so perfect
[33:22] is hidden in the big brother because
[33:26] the big brother
[33:32] so I want us to look at the coming of
[33:35] Christ
[33:38] the coming of Christ
[33:40] was first promising Genesis 3 15.
[33:46] where he says that uh
[33:51] we bruise
[33:54] so the woman is the same
[33:57] that was prophesied to come in
[34:01] Genesis
[34:04] is the coming forth of the Lord Jesus
[34:07] Christ
[34:08] and the purpose was defined in Genesis 3
[34:12] 15. it is
[34:24] when Jesus said yes it is finished
[34:28] are you together with me he says it is
[34:38] foreign
[35:15] [Applause]
[35:29] we just have to get that understanding
[35:33] by Falling Back
[35:35] Into the Book of Genesis to understand
[35:41] in the foreign
[35:45] [Applause]
[36:04] [Applause]
[36:16] [Music]
[36:18] [Applause]
[36:37] is responsible for your foreign
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:58] [Applause]
[37:20] [Music]
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:46] because your human Spirit
[37:49] works by way of the Mind
[37:51] the reason okay you think you get some
[37:56] kind of uh uh conclusion
[38:00] so the human Spirit
[38:03] works from this mind area
[38:07] and that was the area
[38:10] that the Lord was responsible foreign
[38:25] just in a natural body
[38:28] of five senses
[38:31] and this kind of body is
[38:35] motivated by a human spirit
[38:40] amen I brought you towards that career
[38:44] chapter 12 verse
[38:47] I want us to go there and establish
[39:17] [Applause]
[39:25] [Applause]
[39:51] foreign
[40:32] [Music]
[40:40] but yet as long as he was born a soul
[40:43] like I said
[40:44] he needed the human Spirit
[40:48] to operate this body are you together
[40:52] foreign
[41:43] that's why she failed
[41:48] the soul and spirits that as long as we
[41:52] are born again
[41:54] the club of Glory comes around
[41:58] are you together with me so if we are
[42:02] going to fall
[42:04] you have to walk out of that Glory first
[42:09] but as long as we're in Christ we shall
[42:13] always
[42:16] inside
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:17] foreign
[43:19] are you together with me what is it so
[43:23] but you know what protected Adam
[43:26] was because
[43:28] he came forth in that original image
[43:33] but this is
[43:41] which means our body changes
[43:47] to keep us possible is to eliminate the
[43:51] human spirit
[43:54] foreign
[43:55] [Applause]
[44:00] [Music]
[44:01] [Applause]
[44:06] [Applause]
[44:19] [Applause]
[45:05] really not on your own understanding
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:11] amen
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] [Applause]
[46:06] the
[46:11] Soul MMA of the believer and sits in
[46:16] there
[46:19] is the determinant
[46:22] in everything that we do
[46:24] that's why the scripture says
[46:32] yeah
[46:33] so what God does to protect his elect
[46:38] is to take that element of college
[46:41] creator of eternal life
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:48] [Music]
[46:50] so when the Devil comes to the human
[46:53] spirit
[46:58] and it comes to a point yeah
[47:03] it requires
[47:08] now when they contact the soul
[47:12] the soul is full of the world
[47:15] you just stand like a
[47:19] Christopher
[47:27] praise the Lord
[47:30] praise the Lord
[47:32] amen amen he fills the soul with the
[47:35] Holy Spirit
[47:37] and this forces your human Spirit
[47:41] to fullness
[47:50] the center is
[47:52] is to do with termination by a heavy
[47:57] blow for example
[48:00] um
[48:06] you have bruised over 20
[48:11] are you together with me what is it so
[48:14] that's what Paul is teaching here
[48:17] in Romans chapter 12
[48:19] verse
[48:22] he says that the seek you therefore
[48:24] Brethren a commercial
[48:27] find them
[48:30] that you present your body as a Living
[48:33] Sacrifice
[48:39] which is your reasonable service
[48:48] into reasonable service
[48:55] [Applause]
[49:11] so when your mind is
[49:15] your human spirit is
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:24] what happens now it is possible for you
[49:29] to submit your body
[50:16] [Applause]
[50:33] that you may prove what is good foreign
[50:51] [Applause]
[51:29] does not accept those things
[51:33] so to bruise the Serpent's head
[51:38] is
[51:46] Fallen civilization
[51:50] has imparted upon the believer's life
[51:54] to crash
[51:57] that there was Intelligence
[52:00] which is important to your human Spirit
[52:04] to crush the wisdom
[52:07] but he used to entice is
[52:14] to crash
[52:16] the wild desires
[52:25] foreign
[52:45] foreign
[52:49] [Applause]
[53:17] because
[53:21] [Music]
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:57] foreign
[54:00] [Music]
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:34] [Music]
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:20] and right to life
[55:23] uh
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:43] the day you
[55:45] die
[55:47] and when he lost his life
[55:50] he also lost his inheritance in life
[55:58] are you together with what is it yeah so
[56:02] eternal life
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:07] was lost
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:14] amen amen so Satani
[56:17] bruised bruised on his heels
[56:21] it is
[56:34] amen Amina so what did the Satan put
[56:37] here
[56:39] that brings us to achievement what will
[56:43] that Holy Father purifying
[56:46] when it comes to purifying the earth
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:55] and the prophet called us the politics
[56:59] the Sinners the end the systems
[57:12] foreign

[1:00:16] your father's good pleasure

[1:02:50] that has nothing to do with me
[1:02:54] this is the measure that God gave me
[1:02:57] and I'm thankful for it
[1:03:00] if there is a better preacher somewhere
[1:03:04] that's okay with me this is the measure
[1:03:07] that God has given
[1:03:10] the moment they come my competition
[1:03:14] in spiritual things

[1:05:05] he never rests on
[1:05:12] with the spirit of competition

[1:47:48] because as long as your human
[1:47:50] intelligence is dead because
[1:47:57] his wisdom
[1:48:03] I am dead number four I'm here to leave
[1:48:09] Jesus Christ
[1:48:11] [Applause]
[1:48:14] he has no weapons
[1:48:16] when that mind is bruised down
[1:48:22] God never uses a man who is still in
[1:48:26] charge of himself okay for God
[1:48:29] a man trusting in his intelligence
[1:48:33] and his ability
[1:48:35] because the over such a while
[1:48:38] God has no headship
[1:48:44] perfect strength in a perfect week
[1:48:50] when you look at a minister
[1:48:54] don't look at his qualities
[1:48:58] look at Christy
[1:49:04] are you together with him listen now
[1:49:15] Christ first of all gave him a personal
[1:49:19] revelation of who he was Christopher yes
[1:49:24] and after that he tore down
[1:49:29] the glory and the glamor of Peter
[1:49:34] before the people he was going to lead
[1:49:40] um
[1:49:42] are you together with me what is it he
[1:49:45] had to puncture the headship
[1:49:48] the intelligence
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:56] in front of the people
[1:49:59] he has the keys
[1:50:06] so that they cannot rely on the Charisma
[1:50:10] of Peter um
[1:50:14] the Bible says
[1:50:24] but in the Christ I am a Christian
[1:50:26] that's what he was doing Peter get
[1:50:30] behind him
[1:50:35] [Applause]
[1:50:37] that he used to stand up to claim
[1:50:41] leadership
[1:50:47] foreign
[1:51:12] together
[1:51:20] so God never uses a mystery man
[1:51:25] amen amen who's Mystics
[1:51:28] in life have never been known
[1:51:36] are you together what is it so listen to
[1:51:39] brother Branham we said okay but I was

[1:52:56] standing behind the people I mean in
[1:52:59] front of the people
[1:53:00] the mystics and so we would be many
[1:53:05] compared to somebody that stood for
[1:53:07] three five years
[1:53:11] but we thank God for the rubber
[1:53:16] there is

[1:56:27] he's the first man who made a friend
[1:56:30] named
[1:56:33] in 1988.
[1:56:36] when I first went to Canada

[1:56:45] his wife became sick
[1:56:52] and they tried every treatment

[1:57:04] he's arrested now yeah and he says
[1:57:08] brother Harold what all gone hurt I
[1:57:11] think my wife is going through this

[2:00:01] why can I not follow Thee
[2:00:04] I will let down my life for me
[2:00:11] Peter
[2:00:13] thought he could become the Messiah
[2:00:20] you know Peter's wavering nature was
[2:00:24] totally exposed
[2:00:29] so that we may understand today
[2:00:32] that God can never use a man who is full
[2:00:37] of himself
[2:00:42] Commando
[2:00:54] Peter Pedro he was having a monopolistic
[2:00:58] nature everything
[2:01:03] when you know the Lord says to him

[2:01:08] he looks behind
[2:01:10] John is coming
[2:01:12] he says what will this man do come on
[2:01:20] he exposes his nature
[2:01:25] learning from Peter's experience
